f7f9e572bae37cd777a5f03055586ef50c96211f,Establishing genomic/transcriptomic links between Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus by meta-analysis approach.,"Meta-analysis methods exist for combining multiple microarray datasets. However, there are a wide range of issues associated with microarray meta-analysis and a limited ability to compare the performance of different metaanalysis methods. Using cDNA microarray technology (Partek Genomics Suite 6.6) and global pathway analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (IPA, Inc), we examined the transcript level in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls. To understand the molecular link between T2DM and AD, we compared the gene expression pattern and pathway involved. Microarray analysis identified 235 differentially expressed genes between T2DM patients and controls; and 834 between AD and controls at two fold change and a false discovery rate of 0.05. Significantly changed expression of ""myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1; RAS guanyl releasing protein 1; S100 calcium-binding protein A8; prostaglandin- endoperoxide synthase 2; parvalbumin; endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1; phosphoglycerate kinase 1; Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F; Interleukin-1 beta; tubulin, beta 2A; glycine receptor alpha 1 and ribosomal protein S24"" genes were highly associated with T2DM, whereas ""neuronal differentiation 6; G-protein coupled receptor 83; phosphoserine phosphatase; bobby sox homolog or HMG box -containing protein 2; Glutathione S-transferase theta 1; alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 zinc-binding; Heat shock 70kDa protein 1B; transportin 1, Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B; Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5; inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase B; prenylcysteine oxidase 1 like"" were found to be strongly related with AD. We also found a set of differentially expressed genes; ""ARP2 actin-related protein 2; Cell division control protein 42; cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4; Early growth response protein 1; ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5; folate receptor 1; glutamate-ammonia ligase; hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase; 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; interleukin 1 receptor- like 1; leukemia inhibitory factor receptor; metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1; pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4; phosphoserine phosphatase, parvalbumin, and tubulin, beta 2A"" to be present in both dataset. Altered regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, including Ephrin receptor, liver X receptor/ retinoid X receptor; interleukin 6; insulinlike growth factor 1; interleukin 10 and 14-3-3-mediated signaling pathways were associated with T2DM as well as Alzheimer-type pathology.

1848546eb3ab980bd862cccc7b11414ef13b19e3,Association of genetic variants with chronic kidney disease in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Although diabetes mellitus has been recognized as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), genetic factors for predisposition to CKD in individuals with diabetes mellitus remain elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to CKD among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study population comprised 1742 Japanese individuals, including 636 subjects with CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 ml/min/1.73 m2] and 1106 controls (eGFR>or=60 ml/min/1.73 m2). The genotypes for 24 polymorphisms of 22 candidate genes were determined. An initial screen of allele frequencies by the Chi-square test revealed that four polymorphisms were significantly (false discovery rate<0.05) associated with the prevalence of CKD in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates as well as a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that the 8733T-->C polymorphism of ALOX5AP (rs3803278), the C-->T (Ser532Leu) polymorphism of IRAK1 (rs1059703), and the 2445G-->A (Ala54Thr) polymorphism of FABP2 (rs1799883) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with the prevalence of CKD. Our results suggest that ALOX5AP, IRAK1, and FABP2 are susceptibility loci for CKD among Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yutaka Nishigaki"", ids = ""6466382""); list(name = ""Takao Suzuki"", ids = ""144579673""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",f7f0fa847b5b8d948eda8219350057c8ceb55c9b; ca5ce136d72943d0d4d34cc5cac4de1b7618eb43; 4a2e7f6bbea3b3ccb3a4c19800d0ed18186041cf; 3c0949d50137b5aebc8e8098b6056440db48395d; 5230511f02af8d44a51ff31a42b47401f378c84e; a467218e6f98a1160b264232998a8ba6e2eee114; 685e9ecb362a44d67deeb870a5adc080fa20456a; 77f23ef0fa9480845d627d5f8c08d6a3a1f6f9fe,88c2b48ce20b14a48a8b8d55a5be0b902ba07c7f; 0e01084882ab2522bea6d7b352e82d3a440c987f; 66095997bec5a40ac13b9ef49fa88531772dd73c; 850c1be3a8b5186f8e6745620f3158de410c51a6; 549889f1809add1c26adb32a9db6d5f6bb993d36; 8bb33aed87bed6758a46f72395bcc5e2e8c8cf11; f67f710d2078297a5627c29ae6524d11562a89c1; 8d82828e7319345f856091653e22f0b6a2902750; 069bc92ea5f47e10b8918790a5bfb38801757bcc; f5dd35803733bc99c44300302d6860c68dad9119; fae6f69e7d841e82568465cd80eaec2e41cabf48; f79b2439833d849690f046e831d4a2122e50cd96; a0bdf1d25b446e75cf91cd29f1d05ece252b7b64; 15d34f4dbc6c4e061f0dfd34d4ee0184e793bde3; a39722839056cfb989c9a0e25f549296af372f74; 0b481d03f44e45064b51cad9df476e868319fbf4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 910b44f6554a2b2e0d621dd1fb4c99ab35d397e1; 67e68f158efb36a9356c585155e37fdcb7d7c527; e6906a4b6287f65b30b708e93bcfd43f984c914c; ca26ff420114cb59947e9f8f4a2014458d26414f; 8cc175f8c59d7c369ae2695e87073c03289cf4b2; c2914a25b0bd187c2523c34cb933c65bb4678c22; 1d6e0321893c22f82a41cb1c594769d599d45de0; 3beac1486195d6085a668961a9d44282f35065e4; 9a1fe6fdff4b2339277bb7ffa983eff1dc1bd9d8; 744617890f25548877c35d8c7715a8d29f0080d3; ea768661fd6731ab2de740b57e582912e76638e7; 24cdde76a60aa4d9baadce6c4fda65ecfc7ff84f; a65f38773dcd7cabdf3772ee414d485557a40465; 57755e403dba5ecc0aa561f67105266989cfa228; 24d857b48d366384698c0287a85c09778b08ecc5; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; 1ba494ceb331a9a56331a5e3021bb855307ef348; 3d2fd6c1cf37596fbf2423877aee46c7bae95a08; d1db4d8384474492d368407de59dcf56af73d256,International journal of molecular medicine,23 4,"

Results: The GI transit time was significantly decreased on high fiber chow as compared to regular chow, both in GF (278Â±15 vs 503Â±15 min, p<0.05) and HM (225Â±24 vs 300Â±42 min, p<0.05), suggesting high fiber shortens GI transit independent of gut microbiota. Unweighted UniFrac-based principal component analysis (PCA) of microbiota composition showed primary clustering based on diet in HM. Significant changes using a 5% false discovery rate included an increase in Bacteroidaceae and loss of Peptococcaceae in mice on high fiber chow. To determine if these changes were due to shortened GI transit we treated HM mice with PEG in drinking water to induce rapid GI transit. PEG-treatedmice showed significant changes in gut microbial community composition, followed by a return to original community structure 14 days after stopping PEG. Differences again included a significant increase in Bacteroidaceae and decrease in Peptococcaceae (similar to rapid transit induced by high dietary fiber) in addition to changes in several other taxa. Unweighted UniFrac-based PCA showed clustering of samples from high fiber diet together with PEG treatedmice. Several members of the family Bacteroidaceae (B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, B uniformis) failed to grow on minimal media supplemented with either PEG or cellulose, suggesting the increase in Bacteroidaceae was not secondary to degradation of cellulose or PEG by its members. Loperamide-treated mice with slow GI transit also showed a reversible disturbance in gut microbial community with a significant decrease in Lachnospiraceae. Conclusion: These data suggest that diet-associated changes in GI transit play a significant role in mediating diet-induced alterations of gut microbial communities. This study also raises the possibility that changes in gut microbial communities described in inflammatory conditions of the gut may partly be due to changes in GI transit often seen in these patients.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gerard Clarke"", ids = ""145555440""); list(name = ""Sue Grenham"", ids = ""4463508""); list(name = ""Patrick Fitzgerald"", ids = ""50725374""); list(name = ""Rachel D.

73a8f830bfa6f06aabe9897158c22a5b4e53f38d,Evaluation of gene expression profiles and pathways underlying postnatal development in mouse sclera,"PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to identify the genes and pathways underlying the growth of the mouse sclera during postnatal development.


METHODS
Total RNA was isolated from each of 30 single mouse sclera (n=30, 6 sclera each from 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, and 8-week-old mice) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a T7-N(6) primer. The resulting cDNA was fragmented, labeled with biotin, and hybridized to a Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. ANOVA analysis was then performed using Partek Genomic Suite 6.5 beta and differentially expressed transcript clusters were filtered based on a selection criterion of â‰¥ 2 relative fold change at a false discovery rate of â‰¤ 5%. Genes identified as involved in the main biologic processes during postnatal scleral development were further confirmed using qPCR. A possible pathway that contributes to the postnatal development of the sclera was investigated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.


RESULTS
The hierarchical clustering of all time points showed that they did not cluster according to age. The highest number of differentially expressed transcript clusters was found when week 1 and week 2 old scleral tissues were compared. The peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a) gene was found to be involved in the networks generated using Ingenuity Pathway Studio (IPA) from the differentially expressed transcript cluster lists of week 2 versus 1, week 3 versus 2, week 6 versus 3, and week 8 versus 6. The gene expression of Ppargc1a varied during scleral growth from week 1 to 2, week 2 to 3, week 3 to 6, and week 6 to 8 and was found to interact with a different set of genes at different scleral growth stages. Therefore, this indicated that Ppargc1a might play a role in scleral growth during postnatal weeks 1 to 8.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression of eye diseases should be studied as early as postnatal weeks 1-2 to ensure that any changes in gene expression pattern during disease development are detected. In addition, we propose that Ppargc1a might play a role in regulating postnatal scleral development by interacting with a different set of genes at different scleral growth stages.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wanâ\200\231E.

Evaluate day-night associations between clinical seizure types and timing of seizures with seizure outcome.
 Methods: 
Data were obtained from a self-reported seizure database (SeizureTracker.com).Seizures with missing data regarding timing or type were excluded. Seizure outcomes were defined as a) isolated single event (ISE); b) status epilepticus (lasting >5 minutes (SE); c) seizure cluster type 1 (>2 in 5 minutes (SC1)); d) seizure cluster type 2 (>3 with-in a 24-hour period (SC2)). ""Day"" and ""night"" were classified by averaging the differences in sunset and sunrise times across the US. Analysis was performed using logistic regression models within a generalized estimating equations framework. Multiple comparisons adjustments were performed using false discovery rate procedure with q=0.1. Model summarized odds ratio (OR) of a particular seizure type increasing in frequency overnight. OR>1 correspond to night, <1 to day and =1 to no relationship.
 Results: 
A total of 10208 patients, including 5835 children and 4373 adults, were analyzed. For ageâ‰¤18 the following clinical seizure types presented with increased odds of developing increased seizure frequency at night: in the transition between ISE and SE, absence (OR=1.48), complex-partial/gelastic (OR=1.75), and infantile spasms (OR=1.43). Transitioning ISE to SC1: absence (OR=1.33) and simple partial (OR=1.26). Similarly, ISE to SC2: infantile spasm (OR=1.49). For age>18 (N=3300), the following clinical seizures types were more likely to present with increased seizures and transition from ISE to SC1: absence (OR=1.53), atonic/clonic/tonic (OR=1.44), and myoclonic (OR=1.45) and ISE to SC2: absence (OR=1.29) at night. Atonic/clonic/tonic seizures (OR=0.63) were more likely to transition from ISE to SC2 during daytime.
 Conclusions: 
Self-reported clinical seizure types in relation to day-night occurrence may assist in the identification of patients at risk of increasing seizure frequency patterns and SE. Understanding such relationships may harken design of tailored diurnal and nocturnal targeted interventions in patients at greatest risk. Disclosure: Dr. Kapur has nothing to disclose.

GCâ€“MS and multivariate analyses were used to compare the metabolite profiles of developing caryopses of two independently transformed lines over-expressing Dx5 and another two independently transformed lines expressing only the selectable-marker gene (controls). Developing grain at 7, 14 and 21 Days Post-Anthesis (DPA) was studied to observe differences in metabolically active tissues. There was no distinction between the Dx5 transformants and the controls by principal component analysis (PCA) suggesting that their metabolite compositions were similar. Most changes in metabolite levels and starch occurred at 14 DPA but tapered off by 21 DPA. Only 3 metabolites, guanine, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and Unknown 071306a, were altered due to Dx5 expression after correction for false discovery rates (PÂ <Â 0.0005). However, discriminant function analysis (DFA) and correlative analyses of the metabolites showed that Dx5-J, which had the highest level of Dx5 protein in ripe caryopses, could be distinguished from the other genotypes. The second aim of this work was to determine the influence of gene transformation on the metabolome. Cross-comparison of the transformed controls to each other, and to the Dx5 genotypes showed that approximately 50% of the metabolic changes in the Dx5 genotypes were potentially due to variations arising from gene transformation and not from the expression of the Dx5-gene per se.

In the ADNI image database, we created expert delineations of the ventricles, as parametric surface meshes, in 6 brain MRI scans. These 6 images and their embedded surfaces were fluidly registered to MRI scans of 80 AD patients, 80 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 80 healthy controls. Surface averaging within subjects greatly reduced segmentation error. Surface-based statistical maps revealed powerful correlations between surface morphology at baseline and (1) diagnosis, (2) cognitive performance (MMSE scores), (3) depression, and (4) predicted future decline, over a 1 year interval, in 3 standard clinical scores (MMSE, global and sum-of-boxes CDR). We used a false discovery rate method (FDR) method based on cumulative probability plots to find that 40 subjects were sufficient to discriminate AD from normal groups. 60 and 119 subjects, respectively, were required to correlate ventricular enlargement with MMSE and clinical depression. Surface-based FDR, along with multi-atlas fluid registration to reduce segmentation error, will allow researchers to (1) estimate sample sizes with adequate power to detect groups differences, and (2) compare the power of mapping methods head-to-head, optimizing cost-effectiveness for future clinical trials.",2009,Physics; Computer Science; Engineering,"list(name = ""Yi-Yu Chou"", ids = ""1847961""); list(name = ""Natasha Lepore"", ids = ""1702792""); list(name = ""Christina Avedissian"", ids = ""2993738""); list(name = ""Sarah K.

63b4eb4934de6bc4f1c81ed9a9e937d117e4d4cc,A new source detection algorithm using FDR,"The False Discovery Rate (FDR) method has recently been described by Miller et al (2001), along with several examples of astrophysical applications. FDR is a new statistical procedure due to Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) for controlling the fraction of false positives when performing multiple hypothesis testing. The importance of this method to source detection algorithms is immediately clear. To explore the possibilities offered we have developed a new task for performing source detection in radio-telescope images, Sfind 2.0, which implements FDR. We compare Sfind 2.0 with two other source detection and measurement tasks, Imsad and SExtractor, and comment on several issues arising from the nature of the correlation between nearby pixels and the necessary assumption of the null hypothesis. The strong suggestion is made that implementing FDR as a threshold defining method in other existing source-detection tasks is easy and worthwhile. We show that the constraint on the fraction of false detections as specified by FDR holds true even for highly correlated and realistic images. For the detection of true sources, which are complex combinations of source-pixels, this constraint appears to be somewhat less strict. It is still reliable enough, however, for a priori estimates of the fraction of false source detections to be robust and realistic.",2001,Physics,"list(name = ""A. M.

94dfe5c4449985c1b081384e2a8eeeb9c3c96371,Incorporating Error-Rate-Controlled Prior in Modelling Brain Functional Connectivity,"Inferring effective connectivity using fMRI is of in- creasing importance for understanding brain function. Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) modeling has been suggested as a promising and suitable method for this purpose. However, in practice, the success of DBN modeling is largely limited for rea- sons of intensive computational complexity in large networks and of accurately controlling the error rate of the model structural features. Very recently, we have developed a framework that is able to control the false discovery rate (FDR) of the discovered network edges. In this paper, we propose incorporating an FDR- controlled network-structure prior into DBN modeling for brain functional connectivity. Simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly accelerate the DBN learning process while simultaneously controlling the FDR. Its application to a real fMRI study revealed that certain functional connectivities in Parkinson's disease patients' brain are ""recovered"" by L-dopa medication, and also that extra connections between brain regions may represent compensatory mechanisms. I. INTRODUCTION Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) allows non-invasive assessment of brain activity and has the potential for enhancing insight into brain functioning. Effective brain connectivity, defined as the neural influence that one brain region exerts over another, is of critical importance for the understanding of brain function, and its impairment may be associated with neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkin- son Disease (PD). Several mathematical models have been proposed to discover brain connectivity using fMRI, such as structural equation modeling (SEM) and multivariate au- toregressive models (MAR). Among them, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) have recently attracted increasing attention (1) due to their solid basis in statistics. DBN models repre- sent fMRI region-of-interest (ROI) time courses as variable nodes connected by directed arcs denoting their probabilistic dependence. Despite the advantages of DBN modeling, there are nev- ertheless some concerns that may restrict its current suit- ability for fMRI analysis. First, the computational costs of the time-consuming structure-searching of large DBNs can be prohibitive, making exploratory analysis less practical. Secondly, current structure-learning algorithms for DBNs do not explicitly control the error rate of the discovered net- works, since score-based search methods generally assess the suitability of a given structure by the overall goodness-of-fit. However, for studying brain connectivity, a desirable network- learning model should not only fit data well, but also be able to control the error rate of connectivity features in the learned networks (e.g. edges), as this is often the important feature for meaningful neuroscience interpretation. As for many real world applications involving multiple hypothesis testing, controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) (2) of the learned edges is a more suitable error rate criterion than the traditional type-I and type-II error rates. We have therefore proposed a general theoretical framework to control the FDR of the recovered connections (3), in which discrete models were studied for demonstration. We demonstrated that the proposed FDR-controlled PC algorithm is computationally efficient and can control the FDR closely around the user- specified level. Very recently we have extended the framework in (3) to learning the structure of DBNs from continuous fMRI data. Therefore, in this paper, to facilitate both the structure- searching and control the FDR of the learned connectivity edges in DBN modeling, we propose incorporating an FDR- controlled network-structure prior into DBN modeling for inferring brain functional connectivity. The basic idea is to derive a prior probability distribution over network structures based on the output of the FDR-controlled PC algorithms and further to learn the DBN model with the derived prior distribution. We will demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach by simulations. Finally a real fMRI study on Parkinson's disease will be discussed.",2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Junning Li"", ids = ""34959277""); list(name = ""Zheng Wang"", ids = ""48708116""); list(name = ""Martin J.

The method is an efficient method to control the false discovery rate in hypothesis tests for separate covariates. This paper presents a generalisation of the technique using multiple sets of model-free knockoffs. This is formulated as an open question in Candes et al. [4]. With multiple knockoffs, we are able to reduce the randomness in the knockoffs, making the result stronger. Since we use the same structure for generating all the knockoffs, the computational resources is far smaller than proportional with the number of knockoffs. We prove a bound on the asymptotic false discovery rate when the number of sets increases that is better then the published bounds for one set.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lars Holden"", ids = ""1847101""); list(name = ""Kristoffer H Hellton"", ids = ""6076423"")",2f6142ccb71416f8ef47af14b218880a7210fdc3,ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd,arXiv: Methodology,,

Using proteomic approach in this study, we sought to identify proteins with heparin affinity associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and non-inflammatory arthritis (NIA).


METHODS
Plasma samples from adult RA, PsA and NIA patients, 20 of each, were collected. After enrichment of proteins with heparin affinity, SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion with trypsin were performed. Peptides were concentrated, micro-purified, separated and measured by nano-scale HPLC system coupled to a mass spectrometer. Peak lists were generated from raw spectra and searched against human complete proteome set by MaxQuant software. Statistical analysis of protein relative expression levels was done in IPython interactive Python shell using NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. Individual protein impact on the whole dataset correlation was done by excluding one protein at a time and calculating the correlation coefficient of remaining data points.


RESULTS
Three hundred and eighty-four different proteins were identified keeping false discovery rate to 1%, from which 163 were identified in all three conditions. The plasma proteome showed a good correlation between rheumatoid (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Out of 10 proteins whose impact on the correlation coefficient fell outside of two standard deviations from the mean, four were up-regulated (complement factor I, complement component C8 beta, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H1), and two were down-regulated (immunoglobulin heavy chain V-III region BRO, and immunoglobulin J chain), both in PsA and RA by a similar ratio when compared to NIA. The remaining four proteins (Serpin A11, complement factor H-related protein 5, cartilage acidic protein 1 and coagulation factor IX) were down-regulated in PsA and up-regulated in RA when compared to NIA.

1c213aae7b7a1189cd611878c6e9c3b5158366aa,Identification of 26 novel loci that confer susceptibility to early-onset coronary artery disease in a Japanese population,"Early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD) has a strong genetic component. Although genome-wide association studies have identified various genes and loci significantly associated with CAD mainly in European populations, genetic variants that contribute toward susceptibility to this condition in Japanese patients remain to be definitively identified. In the present study, exome-wide association studies (EWASs) were performed to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to early-onset CAD in Japanese. A total of 7,256 individuals aged â‰¤65 years were enrolled in the present study. EWAS were conducted on 1,482 patients with CAD and 5,774 healthy controls. Genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed using Illumina Human Exome-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip or Infinium Exome-24 BeadChip arrays. The association between allele frequencies for 31,465 SNPs that passed quality control and CAD was examined using Fisher's exact test. To compensate for multiple comparisons of allele frequencies with CAD, a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 was applied for statistically significant associations. The association between allele frequencies for 31,465 SNPs and CAD, as determined by Fisher's exact test, demonstrated that 170 SNPs were significantly (FDR <0.05) associated with CAD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, and the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia revealed that 162 SNPs were significantly (P<0.05) associated with CAD. A stepwise forward selection procedure was performed to examine the effects of genotypes for the 162 SNPs on CAD. The 54 SNPs were significant (P<0.05) and independent [coefficient of determination (R2), 0.0008 to 0.0297] determinants of CAD. These SNPs together accounted for 15.5% of the cause of CAD. Following examination of results from previous genome-wide association studies and linkage disequilibrium of the identified SNPs, 21 genes (RNF2, YEATS2, USP45, ITGB8, TNS3, FAM170B-AS1, PRKG1, BTRC, MKI67, STIM1, OR52E4, KIAA1551, MON2, PLUT, LINC00354, TRPM1, ADAT1, KRT27, LIPE, GFY and EIF3L) and five chromosomal regions (2p13, 4q31.2, 5q12, 13q34 and 20q13.2) that were significantly associated with CAD were newly identified in the present study. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that various biological functions were predicted in the 18 genes identified in the present study. The network analysis revealed that the 18 genes had potential direct or indirect interactions with the 30 genes previously revealed to be associated with CAD or with the 228 genes identified in previous genome-wide association studies. The present study newly identified 26 loci that confer susceptibility to CAD. Determination of genotypes for the SNPs at these loci may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for CAD in Japanese patients.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""51026510""); list(name = ""Yoshiki Yasukochi"", ids = ""8544496""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Hideki Horibe"", ids = ""3512685""); list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Ichiro Takeuchi"", ids = ""3046458""); list(name = ""Jun Sakuma"", ids = ""46764062"")",c1cc30b8b6025025344b57b2f0d093ababac5d3e; 2801b443d30bebd682958087b754ec5e40b20a7e; 1ec0e4a21bac5933eadc350976f0baf05b71c7ec; ea05a8b98c8bfe68068ad645e65bf54da7977083,d7f012f3290fb4a19a4ad91557f4ae02ed65a139; cf3ba2771acfa3259e90a4da7b4876f67314b918; 273da6d866b64ef53047e46f52139de639eec426; 6d0a6ffdd3af414879ee8a2576de122123443e13; 423df7d78cd7e556c7e7ef351a9081aa80496668; 8f5b753d7bebaedf12cad8cee948ec21422a67f1; c92b92a0d3227945f0f5648130e059ce4b8d7bc9; 5469a5c3da7afc3fe01d6a4e0c2919df8feae4ea; 28204d4700be71e78ddbf508f058c12869cc8774; 9771d2df7eb353df6db994223a46a911f91bbeb1; e71e48ad57f10cfeb9fe330a6fa15718bbb50696; 8044216f0e68899e212d1889673c09940175ec5c; 29e530fbad2f5de99f86d21cbb0eeb4869423294; 20ef5b1598230791f836cd8909cd326695126cda; b77a86b4786666510a1372fecc0d1cc3c824f843; 1df7e42cacccae00d3988ce1589467e7167bc680; f330a8d168654261b5427230900ffbdba5bf065c; 459a65157592599544e150a74c2b68af2fc1e117; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; ced700033516a1d2654b95ebb795f744ed496676; 0c758609bcaf33e695e8967dc2cc657c04e8671f; e0b0d54f8df0ce4a090df67da2e7d7d42f7d4db6; c401084cfbec16bc23fb3d99fc0a534c7c6d96cb; a4834d5d528c7aa9f85f3356395b5492231b9b72; e82013627cfda3d6ba3dcf4668c9c7b3b4112af6; 386b0d9046097113eed56f86e3ddadadc64e7969; 7613f70ec7e44cf2c1e7d260dc21e5897b69a0db; 118ae372a66d2ad6a29cb0e6dcf739e27f07851f; c347d056e11ebba37706dadf4a6804bbbf32da50; 24533fd0838f6bf38c7170b9c427b027a3e14ff4; d53c271fd18f9b4c2744d080db042804e3261f7e; 53f8909d0216f0c24b9e54da745765d6f91cb369; 936b66318975320562f0c8c1cc6a327ad4d46419; e0fb3293dcf36d46bb179e81576e4c41e42934c5; 1e67909a54bced7a59bd58350f5a6d1ca4e9cd17; 66131918781a45ea4c050120a298b426ad15ae6b; 63f4ea05f40d161d574b03a502dfa8657bf4064a; 6d0320366e582da5c7dabbd4befb6eaa0c5f2a10; 5aaafa212640191412c214f54eb5e044599f05ba; 3193da63f068dc95a5ac9a8fb3810e9ba2c80cd0; 54b1be1694a3273c7947b9c09804a7e0a982ee4a; 7517af6359fca92c7d4401db1e3767d4d3aaa90e; 39cb8c05512361134f335f325298b6740436377f; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 4012d82a0f5801f30877607340879afd9f92d1d0; cee5c856959edc3b97c645397bc9c00f649f439d; 666fbfd9410a97f42686beec53be5e1d58212937; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ae77afd038c7c7c22453b307fd64f3cfff0bb6f4; fa5ddb6ad6a9d73f434095d4f9d84169be4d7657,Biomedical Reports,9,383 - 404
6605812f66b267965c61f76150491e968dea32f6,Evaluation of the performance of copy number variant prediction tools for the detection of deletions from whole genome sequencing data,"BACKGROUND
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has increased in popularity and decreased in cost over the past decade, rendering this approach as a viable and sensitive method for variant detection. In addition to its utility for single nucleotide variant detection, WGS data has the potential to detect Copy Number Variants (CNV) to fine resolution. Many CNV detection software packages have been developed exploiting four main types of data: read pair, split read, read depth, and assembly based methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of each of these main approaches in detecting germline deletions.


METHODS
WGS data and high confidence deletion calls for the individual NA12878 from the Genome in a Bottle consortium were the benchmark dataset. The performance of BreakDancer, CNVnator, Delly, FermiKit, and Pindel was assessed by comparing the accuracy and sensitivity of each software package in detecting deletions exceeding 1â€¯kb.


RESULTS
There was considerable variability in the outputs of the different WGS CNV detection programs. The best performance was seen from BreakDancer and Delly, with 92.6% and 96.7% sensitivity, respectively and 34.5% and 68.5% false discovery rate (FDR), respectively. In comparison, Pindel, CNVnator, and FermiKit were less effective with sensitivities of 69.1%, 66.0%, and 15.8%, respectively and FDR of 91.3%, 69.0%, and 31.7%, respectively. Concordance across software packages was poor, with only 27 of the total 612 benchmark deletions identified by all five methodologies.


CONCLUSIONS
The WGS based CNV detection tools evaluated show disparate performance in identifying deletions â‰¥1â€¯kb, particularly those utilising different input data characteristics. Software that exploits read pair based data had the highest sensitivity, namely BreakDancer and Delly. BreakDancer also had the second lowest false discovery rate. Therefore, in this analysis read pair methods (BreakDancer in particular) were the best performing approaches for the identification of deletions â‰¥1â€¯kb, balancing accuracy and sensitivity. There is potential for improvement in the detection algorithms, particularly for reducing FDR. This analysis has validated the utility of WGS based CNV detection software to reliably identify deletions, and these findings will be of use when choosing appropriate software for deletion detection, in both research and diagnostic medicine.",2019,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Whitney Whitford"", ids = ""35203312""); list(name = ""Klaus Lehnert"", ids = ""145822126""); list(name = ""Russell G Snell"", ids = ""143744535""); list(name = ""Jessie C.

47b87dd76da1c11bd91f3070ec4cbe53968c603a,Additional common variants associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease detected using a pleiotropic cFDR method.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed extensively in diverse populations to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex diseases or traits. However, to date, the SNPs identified fail to explain a large proportion of the variance of the traits/diseases. GWASs on type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CARD) are generally performed as single-trait studies, rather than analyzing the related traits simultaneously. Despite the extensive evidence suggesting that these two phenotypes share both genetic and environmental risk factors, the shared overlapping genetic biological mechanisms between these traits remain largely unexplored. Here, we adopted a recently developed genetic pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach to discover novel loci associated with T2D and CARD by incorporating the summary statistics from existing GWASs of these two traits. Applying the cFDR level of 0.05, 33 loci were identified for T2D and 34 loci for CARD, 9 of which for both. By incorporating pleiotropic effects into a conditional analysis framework, we observed that there is significant pleiotropic enrichment between T2D and CARD. These findings may provide novel insights into the etiology of T2D and CARD, as well as the processes that may influence disease development both individually and jointly.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qiang Zhang"", ids = ""49347078""); list(name = ""Hui-Min Liu"", ids = ""2024955""); list(name = ""Wan-Qiang Lv"", ids = ""23620348""); list(name = ""Jing-Yang He"", ids = ""50774762""); list(name = ""Xin Xia"", ids = ""144558661""); list(name = ""Weidong Zhang"", ids = ""117636057""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424""); list(name = ""Changqing Sun"", ids = ""152873476"")",d3fece08204d4a0208b019f763f6724e094d6385,,Journal of diabetes and its complications,32 12,"

725ec971ed0987fcab02f9d483aa8f6125837077,Bayesian Random Segmentation Models to Identify Shared Copy Number Aberrations for Array CGH Data.,"Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a high-resolution high-throughput technique for studying the genetic basis of cancer. The resulting data consists of log fluorescence ratios as a function of the genomic DNA location and provides a cytogenetic representation of the relative DNA copy number variation. Analysis of such data typically involves estimation of the underlying copy number state at each location and segmenting regions of DNA with similar copy number states. Most current methods proceed by modeling a single sample/array at a time, and thus fail to borrow strength across multiple samples to infer shared regions of copy number aberrations. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian random segmentation approach for modeling aCGH data that utilizes information across arrays from a common population to yield segments of shared copy number changes. These changes characterize the underlying population and allow us to compare different population aCGH profiles to assess which regions of the genome have differential alterations. Our method, referred to as BDSAcgh (Bayesian Detection of Shared Aberrations in aCGH), is based on a unified Bayesian hierarchical model that allows us to obtain probabilities of alteration states as well as probabilities of differential alteration that correspond to local false discovery rates.

Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Methods: We examined 2050 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 genes known to regulate cholesterol metabolism in relation to HIV viral load and CD4+ T-cell levels in a multiracial cohort of 1066 antiretroviral therapy-naive women. Results: Six SNPs were associated with both HIV viral load and CD4+ T-cell levels at a false discovery rate of 0.01. Bioinformatics tools did not predict functional activity for five SNPs, located in introns of nuclear receptor corepressor 2, retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), and tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39B. Rs17111557 located in the 3â€² untranslated region of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) putatively affects binding of hsa-miR-548t-5p and hsa-miR-4796â€“3p, which could regulate PCSK9 expression levels. Interrogation of rs17111557 revealed stronger associations in the subset of women with HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection (nâ€Š=â€Š408, 38% of women). Rs17111557 was also associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in HIV/HCV coinfected (&bgr;: âˆ’10.4; 95% confidence interval: âˆ’17.9, âˆ’2.9; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.007), but not in HIV monoinfected (&bgr;:1.2; 95% confidence interval: âˆ’6.3, 8.6; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.76) women in adjusted analysis. Conclusion: PCSK9 polymorphism may affect HIV pathogenesis, particularly in HIV/HCV coinfected women. A likely mechanism for this effect is PCSK9-mediated regulation of cholesterol metabolism.

As an improvement over the standard mixture model that tests all the genes iid a priori, Wei and Li (2007) and Wei and Pan (2008) proposed modeling a gene network as a Discrete- or Gaussian-Markov random field (DMRF or GMRF) respectively in a mixture model to analyze genomic data. However, how these methods compare in practical applications in not well understood and this is the aim here. We also propose two novel constraints in prior specifications for the GMRF model and a fully Bayesian approach to the DMRF model. We assess the accuracy of estimating the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by posterior probabilities in the context of MRF models. Applications to a ChIP-chip data set and simulated data show that the modified GMRF models has superior performance as compared with other models, while both MRF-based mixture models, with reasonable robustness to misspecified gene networks, outperform the standard mixture model.",2010,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peng Wei"", ids = ""144537874""); list(name = ""Wei Pan"", ids = ""144282470"")",efff63cd0743834c0815ac6a68a8f5a4c718612d; 5b02774d7a3cf9b3a25557386127e995c71302ce; 9e412a7b635f9354cec17c9bd7e316d162b80cde; b9c5084088aa4281d0d0bfae2aa24135649d3454; 580e8dbfe8fc8aa83a96f29aa5611544928a897e; 8f4dff3da138150fe7c913a4785ac7a3029661e9; bc29abb096fcce30e7256131a0ecb4e7eda471dc; 5e531ca606778866a8dea4fdbd6517b4ec401073; df42117aaaf71ae9a9f2e972d2df84f844f4e2da; a3294cabbeab185f75885af73f1b2485cf80ee6b; 09d14b97dcbc563a3234f42bf4bfa7be2b4919e2; b273e3e21d07453f17c21a3e6f0add463a749dee; 2c3d32754bfb08b88ac33626e19b55af1fa258f8; b22b90a93783e7baa4e72d100ad9a228d3a72dd7; 0fdc5d05e2746e42f17088b27f3bdbc36092273b; 6714afed9c76b17dc4f30e1dcaadd5a7fd98d8af; d0ce07ce69e7b2e768700c9b13bfbaca6acbe648; 2bd102ca0aa60c480183306af28baf1cda0ce188,fd3d628f90e73744621c26421869d90e7eddeb3f; ea68899db5d44b4d6e28228381ee8016d6b728e6; 8d76672d52622d9c45014d630717ce911d1292ba; 7478c077f6f61a82292ec4d9cbe1af9e71537a08; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 55ae873145dead76071fe9d5a7729d707a988325; ae2715069bddfbb872c58e69f84c6cbfe6f7ea68; 374a1b0cfa470d34d3244a6f5686c87531f74168; f25d4112273f1783260f0301a07fc52300d927af; a21e6b15208562760e9bd81cc898b3d9909f721f; 3346c5e3f84d450b0cf41fa15832d8a3ab8565a4; 21666e44dcce62dbe6a3eedc79fc0321e087354b; 08fc38b94d577fb21afd743c619596188aac9b66; a3d6eeb0a954ba8c2ef1a4a85ea213d1da6e1382; 869836518181cfeaeab81d9b8249c805d72e2dd5; cb8202c3189cce0908a721e59f049438db8654c2; 5f31bfe0ed44f70227ec4bd2c26446baabdcc890; b58f7d0a7851dad92afd25ddfe9269954cd45e82; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dcbe693a55172473cfbff5c557f9526b7de43dd7; 6f5d49caa2177ef2a11eb43ac2a5f3becbc3d51e; cfdbd102dfeb595d383452e55565378d355fcb87; 654352f561d7de3b556834f8ae5dae86759abdba; 674b70b8f5c1115ed6c79b1325fc2cbb09ab019c; 6e2b7e5b86c57f7519c19f297bf6f5001b082628; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; c7275437357ea4383e8d91548f7d769030809b6d; 46c12f77484f45007c1ba559259c586993ec68d9; 72b079f6c8820012cb70dc0d12e45a4a7b22bc30; 598607789341a8fc7e545a6e87bf18928b28d537; 7a0cb82e2535e575a6094982da5f55572f94611a; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; f45f963b7b967d526651937c0e5486c8448209cd; 961759e91b5a804edd85b8baf63c9e7649e886af; d8d1d2556fe206ebe3d63a89b59eaeff142e4106,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

f1bdeece116deca3220cbc44214491d5af1046bb,Human embryonic stem cell phosphoproteome revealed by electron transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry.,"Protein phosphorylation is central to the understanding of cellular signaling, and cellular signaling is suggested to play a major role in the regulation of human embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency. Here, we describe the use of conventional tandem mass spectrometry-based sequencing technology--collision-activated dissociation (CAD)--and the more recently developed method electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to characterize the human ES cell phosphoproteome. In total, these experiments resulted in the identification of 11,995 unique phosphopeptides, corresponding to 10,844 nonredundant phosphorylation sites, at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). Among these phosphorylation sites are 5 localized to 2 pluripotency critical transcription factors--OCT4 and SOX2. From these experiments, we conclude that ETD identifies a larger number of unique phosphopeptides than CAD (8,087 to 3,868), more frequently localizes the phosphorylation site to a specific residue (49.8% compared with 29.6%), and sequences whole classes of phosphopeptides previously unobserved.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danielle L.

e46f4e7bf060dd802d55c5021e2b9e25a1ceb298,Prediction of genes and protein-protein interaction networking for miR-221-5p using bioinformatics analysis,"Abstract Recent scientific investigations on P. longifolia leaf extract revealed its anti-cancer property via the regulation of miR-221-5p. However, there were no further investigations performed to report the role miR-221-5p through the regulation of its target genes and the subsequent protein-protein interaction networking which is important in cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, in silico approach was utilized to predict the target genes and protein-protein interaction networking related to miR-221. Therefore, the current research was conducted to analyse the predicted target genes and biological pathways for miR-221-5p as well as to investigate the protein-protein interaction networking using authoritative bioinformatics tools. In this study, computational workflow was proposed to identify the predicted target genes of miR-221-5p using miRGate database, followed by gene enrichment analysis by DAVID and Enrichr bioinformatics and finally protein-protein interaction networking analysis using STRING resource. miR-Gate bioinformatics tool predicted a total of 4910 protein coding gene targets for miR-221-5p, which includes 326 apoptotic genes based on 5 different computation approaches and 4 different validated prediction methods. The gene enrichment analysis through DAVID and Enrichr bioinformatics tools revealed that the predicted genes are involved in the regulation apoptotic pathway based on the gene ontology analysis accounting an enrichment score as high as 7.41 and a false discovery rate as low as 0.12. The protein-protein interaction networking analysis through STRING bioinformatics tool revealed the functional enrichment of the protein network of the post-transcriptional of the predicted gene targets of miR-221-5p are highly related to the regulation of apoptosis with an interaction confidence score of 0.99. The bioinformatics analysis of miR-221-5p revealed the essential role of miR-221-5p in various biological processes, especially in apoptosis regulation, suggesting the regulation of miR-221-5p to be an efficient gene therapeutic target for cancer as a clinically admissible treatment approach.

e7aca485d64a7ea62b71abce947f090551c147fa,XLSearch: a Probabilistic Database Search Algorithm for Identifying Cross-Linked Peptides.,"Chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometric analysis has become an important technique for probing protein three-dimensional structure and protein-protein interactions. A key step in this process is the accurate identification and validation of cross-linked peptides from tandem mass spectra. The identification of cross-linked peptides, however, presents challenges related to the expanded nature of the search space (all pairs of peptides in a sequence database) and the fact that some peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) contain one correct and one incorrect peptide but often receive scores that are comparable to those in which both peptides are correctly identified. To address these problems and improve detection of cross-linked peptides, we propose a new database search algorithm, XLSearch, for identifying cross-linked peptides. Our approach is based on a data-driven scoring scheme that independently estimates the probability of correctly identifying each individual peptide in the cross-link given knowledge of the correct or incorrect identification of the other peptide. These conditional probabilities are subsequently used to estimate the joint posterior probability that both peptides are correctly identified. Using the data from two previous cross-link studies, we show the effectiveness of this scoring scheme, particularly in distinguishing between true identifications and those containing one incorrect peptide.

5006336c07ad589c84bf7fc8ae67ad2cb21220fa,A Cautionary Tale on the Inclusion of Variable Posttranslational Modifications in Database-Dependent Searches of Mass Spectrometry Data.,"Mass spectrometry-based proteomics allows in principle the identification of unknown target proteins of posttranslational modifications and the sites of attachment. Including a variety of posttranslational modifications in database-dependent searches of high-throughput mass spectrometry data holds the promise to gain spectrum assignments to modified peptides, thereby increasing the number of assigned spectra, and to identify potentially interesting modification events. However, these potential benefits come for the price of an increased search space, which can lead to reduced scores, increased score thresholds, and erroneous peptide spectrum matches. We have assessed here the advantages and disadvantages of including the variable posttranslational modifications methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, transformation of N-terminal glutamine to pyroglutamic acid (Glnâ†’pyro-Glu), and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. Based on calculations of local false discovery rates and comparisons to known features of the respective modifications, we recommend for searches of samples that were not enriched for specific posttranslational modifications to only include methionine oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, and peptide N-terminal Glnâ†’pyro-Glu as variable modifications. The principle of the validation strategy adopted here can also be applied for assessing the inclusion of posttranslational modifications for differently prepared samples, or for additional modifications. In addition, we have reassessed the special properties of the ubiquitin footprint, which is the remainder of ubiquitin moieties attached to lysines after tryptic digest. We show here that the ubiquitin footprint often breaks off as neutral loss and that it can be distinguished from dicarbamidomethylation events.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julia Svozil"", ids = ""3737530""); list(name = ""Katja Baerenfaller"", ids = ""3636830"")",2ba96886e88564a568fea12459b3de65c22bfd39; a00b9dbafbd9e8b5baad7ce12a931c4e8dea9cb8,79c85ffaa1b3d7bce2cd0e48dfd8e826e22a60ec; a107af70067f81b7be07334181c78394263f5e3d; 9ad9d7918a245a91c645ac10a51aaa477592dd36; 530c3df063d645b9003d252a2961681e580bae6b; e10d07dab6d42e2fdd8eae2e53e4b0a13d7e691e; 10aacee6e204b3683346dee1dfcb16ffd9ac6e63; 37992448b53505fe012356b58a1ec980a8747fb6; 306d85fce21b688b87e552fc3fd1b3336495f9d6; fb06f50654dee60f3cd4aa91483a6e39b0f7fd0a; 5015d932f1428b60296de91f347b2144c9f46c2d; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 3e17047a518c284f04f0befe648f4a9e364a0725; bfcb182ab9a363a92040b93dc17551fd3432a100; 1d5a5f824cae405e20849827f7ed1f73987cbd51; 055e26f20b9b2fd68cf361ade5b27bf915a29725; 14c5b6a8c8b1e5498efe71a25845e7bb1086d51a; c66185f5dceb246916469378c6cacbf54f51923c; 66d4dd24c454fd7b11f1091b9efc40db954700be; 7337463a06377fc353dbae2be21a300158692ea6; 9e865bd72c4f77c7cff0c2b22ad3601948c98c9b; c5e79f21b065ffe0e765af8498c465d0dc8153ea; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; b09ad3d19ae9632892b9c82b226ca5b152b0baea,Methods in enzymology,586,"

f327574cbf0d31a950be6ca82ab3d69b280ff504,Proper Use of Allele-Specific Expression Improves Statistical Power for cis-eQTL Mapping with RNA-Seq Data.,"Studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) offer insight into the molecular mechanisms of loci that were found to be associated with complex diseases and the mechanisms can be classified into cis- and trans-acting regulation. At present, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is rapidly replacing expression microarrays to assess gene expression abundance. Unlike microarrays that only measure the total expression of each gene, RNA-seq also provides information on allele-specific expression (ASE), which can be used to distinguish cis-eQTLs from trans-eQTLs and, more importantly, enhance cis-eQTL mapping. However, assessing the cis-effect of a candidate eQTL on a gene requires knowledge of the haplotypes connecting the candidate eQTL and the gene, which cannot be inferred with certainty. The existing two-stage approach that first phases the candidate eQTL against the gene and then treats the inferred phase as observed in the association analysis tends to attenuate the estimated cis-effect and reduce the power for detecting a cis-eQTL. In this article, we provide a maximum-likelihood framework for cis-eQTL mapping with RNA-seq data. Our approach integrates the inference of haplotypes and the association analysis into a single stage, and is thus unbiased and statistically powerful. We also develop a pipeline for performing a comprehensive scan of all local eQTLs for all genes in the genome by controlling for false discovery rate, and implement the methods in a computationally efficient software program. The advantages of the proposed methods over the existing ones are demonstrated through realistic simulation studies and an application to empirical breast cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi-Juan Hu"", ids = ""7741363""); list(name = ""Wei Sun"", ids = ""144763148""); list(name = ""Jung-Ying Tzeng"", ids = ""143690777""); list(name = ""Charles M.

3e80ba1dd3d0cc3708c69833d54075fa28308429,Abstract 5556: Identification of signaling pathways active in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by proteomic profiling,"Introduction: While there have been multiple studies identifying differences in phenotypes of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) compared to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), identification of key signaling pathways that may differ and may represent new therapeutic targets for SCLC need to be specified. To this end, we have compared expression of a large number of proteins and genes involved in key cell regulatory pathways of SCLC with those in NSCLC using reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and genome-wide mRNA profiling. Methods: 34 SCLC and 74 NSCLC cell lines that have been previously characterized for oncogenotype mutations, copy number changes, and mRNA expression profiles (using Affymetrix U133A, U133B, U133 Plus 2.0, and Illumina arrays) were grown under 10% serum, serum-starved, and serum-stimulated conditions. Cell lysates from each media condition were harvested and 176 total and phosphoproteins representing multiple signaling pathways were quantified by RPPA. Differences in protein and gene expression levels between SCLC and NSCLC lines were assessed using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, t-test, and ANOVA. Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated SCLC from NSCLC cell lines based on their distinct protein expression patterns under all three media conditions. Two high-grade neuroendocrine NSCLC cell lines clustered with the SCLC cell lines, reflecting their SCLC-like protein expression. Using a false discovery rate of Conclusions: Proteomic profiling identified increased DNA repair and apoptosis pathway activity and decreased MAPK pathway activity in SCLC. Among the proteins upregulated in SCLC, several have potential as therapeutic targets, such as PARP1. Although cKit over expression and cMyc amplification are both common in SCLC, we showed that they were mutually exclusive of each other at a protein expression level, reflecting the heterogeneity of SCLC and suggesting a rationale for testing targeted therapies specifically in subsets of patients whose tumors overexpress the targeted marker. Pathway activation will be further investigated in SCLC patient tumors. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

To test our hypothesis that abnormal DNA methylation loci associated with smoking are enriched in genes and pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, we analyzed two sets of smoking-related methylated genes, in blood and buccal samples, as reported in 28 studies. By analyzing 320 methylated genes from 26 studies of blood samples, we found 57 enriched pathways associated with different types of cancer (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). Of these, 11 were also significantly overrepresented in the 661 methylated genes found in the 2 studies of buccal samples. We further found that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway plays an important role in the initiation of smoking-attributable cancer. Finally, we constructed a subnetwork of genes important for smoking-attributable cancer from the 48 nonredundant genes in the 11 oncogenic pathways. Of these, genes such as DUSP4 and AKT3 are well documented as being involved in smoking-related lung cancer. Taken together, these findings provide robust and systematic evidence in support of smokingâ€™s impact on the epigenome, which may be an important contributor to cancer.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Ming Li"", ids = ""49140660"")",,,,,303-317

baee85850141cab209304e606fdd1d6a044fca0d,Microstructural white matter abnormalities of multiple system atrophy: in vivo topographic illustration by using diffusion-tensor MR imaging.,"PURPOSE
To determine whether diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging can demonstrate microstructural white matter abnormalities of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to correlate these imaging findings with clinical signs and symptoms.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. DT imaging was performed in 16 patients with MSA with predominant cerebellar symptoms (MSA-C) (mean age, 60.0 years + or - 5.1 [standard deviation]; range, 51-69 years) and 16 age-matched healthy subjects. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were compared voxel-by-voxel between the two groups by using a two-sample t test. Overlap maps were created to illustrate areas with FA and MD alterations. Correlation between DT imaging indexes and Barthel index score, scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) score, severity of orthostatic hypotension, age of disease onset, and disease duration was tested by using Spearman rank or Pearson product-moment correlation analysis. T2-weighted and proton density-weighted images of the patients were visually assessed.


RESULTS
Widespread areas of FA reduction and MD elevation were observed in supra- and infratentorial white matter structures in patients with MSA (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Significant correlation (P < .01) between DT imaging indexes and Barthel index score, SARA score, severity of orthostatic hypotension, and disease duration was observed for multiple areas with FA and/or MD alterations. T2-weighted and proton density-weighted images showed no significant abnormality in supratentorial white matter.


CONCLUSION
DT imaging may help identify the microstructural white matter abnormalities of MSA-C. DT imaging may be useful for severity assessment of MSA-C.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Khin Khin Tha"", ids = ""1837561""); list(name = ""Satoshi Terae"", ids = ""1906251""); list(name = ""Ichiro Yabe"", ids = ""3659921""); list(name = ""Tamaki Miyamoto"", ids = ""78413095""); list(name = ""Hiroyuki Soma"", ids = ""47076483""); list(name = ""Yuri Zaitsu"", ids = ""35061304""); list(name = ""Noriyuki Fujima"", ids = ""2029317""); list(name = ""Kohsuke Kudo"", ids = ""9497146""); list(name = ""Hidenao Sasaki"", ids = ""14718933""); list(name = ""Hiroki Shirato"", ids = ""2728701"")",74708580c415ce7f3d71cf6eeb909b41f5925eee; c8d4ec324971e20bde2a8cf16470c2afff733d0a; b91cf48b57f070d944c8781b2b30110af06204af; f740732b68eb42454cf2299b2a7e6c0eb68793f5; d285f87116925cb6699da25d73d3c4af75dcd609; edd4e30e547d58e3697e598a7957b00cfc655710; 1a1f0c28f684fdf078d12efdd6420285ea256be8; 94fab114f664963d0001ae6b4317278dbb3c8fea; cd623ceb170386e18e4cb8da6db4fd2704d04e43; f68dc550d8e64d2196def15718ba5888fe596b53; 780eaef658534fb2a8971d88bb449a16361dec57; b45fa88b5e3ec458f5a350c6f4c1b00e76bfad27; 039c9711a31ff064a5b35a98dc912814fad9f610; ba0116350357e98218f4d58b51d3a32c81c3fbb7; bd7f83da24ebf5eeeb2c04c97d734089c94167e4; 1a7bd0294fcd628ff4ddcb2da3c5f904dd2b97c7; 5d83db48dd9abfd0acea1d18c401c332fd33eb82; 0cbc3aafe6259437372081dbdeef56a1f68667f0; 2856a848720cfb65d713b7ecf92f5931dcbd0fe1,,Radiology,255 2,"

c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef,Sharp and Practical Performance Bounds for MCMC and Multiple Testing,"Author(s): Rabinovich, Maxim | Advisor(s): Jordan, Michael I | Abstract: With the greater adoption of statistical and machine learning methods across science and industry, a greater awareness of the need to align statistical theory ever more closely with the demands of applications is developing. One recurring theme within this process is the re-examination of basic questions and core assumptions through the lens of modern mathematical statistics. This thesis targets two such basic questions in two different contexts: posterior simulation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), on the one hand; and multiple hypothesis testing, on the other. For MCMC, we analyze convergence in terms of the expectations of a limited number of query functions, rather than the entire posterior. We show both theoretically and via simulations that the resultant theory predicts the required chain length more sharply than global convergence criteria. Furthermore, we provide match- ing lower bounds that show our bounds are essentially optimal in their dependence on chain parameters and target accuracy. For multiple testing, we provide the first general framework for establishing the optimal tradeoff between false positives (measured by the False Discovery Rate, or FDR) and false negatives (measured by the False Non-discovery rate, or FNR). We begin by proving some of the first non-asymptotic results available on this topic â€“ initially in the context of Gaussian-like test statistics. We then go on to develop the more general framework. The latter applies to test statistics with essentially arbitrary analytic forms and dependence, recovers previous results as special cases, and yields numerically simulable lower bounds that can be evaluated in almost any model of interest.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Maxim Rabinovich"", ids = ""40354648"")",,359a2fc4a44e90f03d79401af0d68a2f4e8a3f93; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 81a65f23474ffceb2481836328608102950da979; 77809252cebfc7f67280e85d4cf40c740ea2e574; eb211d1441615c7f7176c3f57f11ca35316c4810; f7cdbb822d5d627a57f2698f4b212c42152ee298; 2ff842214ac58a2dfd3a040c9b95cd9b42963d85; 8bbe8c1e137e7b8ffe4497b0542f99c9fc9bbb3e; d029fb0dcd0c55a069a97d0273453defcdee48fe; 1775719a073b2f510ba5454a69f04aa6051fbff0; 69b08cd266c5255d7dcc7890b7e4cab4b248a155; 6a8535befc9ba1788665de3ca3c952dfcbd886d1; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 1351ae828bd776fc5ce2826a21e209be7b0aee84; 59ee093343177e81ae17ac01f33724c6154a0619; 91e62d27c08db29cf011a0326a61509e574cf772; 5465884a4aad5dc256ce5b4bfacdfa7cdc2c78ee; e99f196cf21e0781ef1e119d14e6db45cd71bf3b; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 379daa0dabeffa72b9a0d8c48b361236c03fb302; 2ab5b1d0079a48bde931a06ce36bd662d3cada0b; b4ee596014935f02d5496146774d2b6caae92ba9; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 9db88ccc60b485dbf864316d03e9df73f706a920; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 3036732969db689456cbfd4383eb5fc45f0964a6; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; f62e8cdcc8f89c1458737cbc7ec5264b9ea82b75; 110078eb3f05c7376aa4127719aedd7755fccfaf; 0cd6a57304e89656611273d9d58d918b52e9c81e; de036ad33ff64b30ff974e89812fafba72d440e7; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; c259828eb42fb5a6122f6eaf17fc5436fff21366; 9c67f30235a47e305dc57c9f185d5587faca4236; cb2c5eb63c3b5c2b280a0720fb218626a99b4b70; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 914ae0d35a987f60f6db4c96107c2ad83370ae8e; 349f97c405795f8eb858067f089dbbf48c523b4d; 4858822d60e1e2c81ab71faaadf5c9beb896e29e; d6e477e034b0edd0ba217f8f83c0703f08cd3871; 3cc6c2774e9bd8a4f8fdda8e352a0ee268708a5b; edb5e092911a3197196b822dfd3c90ed4568f13c; 0297dc761420163c70d838f0452df61e80a58884; 302bcbdbc8a7b55d9015a88c311d5eb6716aa817; a37fed5a3f6747df1e499db17d3b8ff3ceb66e70; d93d08bdc5b34d2c27077490afbb7df63c9c46f7; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 45d1b3ef9d9be19b8ba567891966ca34791622f7; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 7c268394c54e26f1488a23640291d71267d6a97c; 5e1bd0a1589a261c51aa5e4ad73768efcc6395b8; 456a8e88c362dd7bee2d911076fb8ca7389593e1; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 2808ae4f4908aebc792048d076e7686922ff2473; 9ea3cd1a9344513d10c45f2bb4762db76e194d0f; ca05e6a389f89b771cf0e6422dc95f1792769971; da3dc58df2f3d62f8a790c1cb67ed9a803e60309; 63459a8d30523809ef221804f1897ebb2e60ecb9; 0b165fbb69e606d2dd743440b0b288ae0e3391d2; 481eb978677eaae4e01639f03212fd81d1a5a448; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; d64e2a9498ff73c11b1a51b348df8db30df7f416; 52f7864e321b30164cb946fc9025c0dcb4076f5d; c08e54c0fdc1b403bec8b1d11d19cf2b997f2b87; 630bab4b708bc6621f97789b14f790153f115d15; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9593dc0682900f5a41bb113c0d2bedde2754df26; 538310f0307915e989351f6e6116a991d1af602c; ce3ccde80ccaaa2225b6f495130aefb2cf436e18; af23df388309d7831997ca736f06f9fd58855587; eae4a397e716b677e79187ce51ab5dc1f6c3a34d; 2a3cd075bd4c0c88117d5d217a8115a7f32cbddd; 05da181799210a90bc56874389629fd7dcfed981; b38eeec1c63fed013262fe34286042d11bb96609; 1311becf342434a949ce5fba51d9b024e052850f; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; be14c56689603b297e5429a8fe1ecee695cd77c7; 68544f3f58f06ada5d3ac34ec2ea4decfc39b131; 64b483e8d68b3f7518c2078d1b707d4543b6f9dc; fd0002aa9b12e6f9880581ebe8e0e72151070c8b; 7b69bc30fdcfe15e2dc99ac41f6f3e504f8c7163; f36ae623f8aec8910e78ae6712569549e15b9f14,,,
12d0ac22cbdcfeb446568cb0d3b19d24875f9837,Potentially addictive properties of sugar-sweetened beverages among adolescents,"Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increase risk of cardiometabolic disease. Young people consume the largest amounts of SSBs and have experienced the greatest relative gains in obesity in the past several decades. There is evidence of addictive properties of both caffeine and sugar, the primary ingredients in SSBs, but little research into such properties of SSBs in naturally occurring consumption patterns. Thus, in this exploratory study, we sought to examine potentially addictive properties of SSBs during a 3-day SSB cessation intervention in overweight and obese adolescents who typically consume â‰¥3 SSBs daily. Participants (nâ€¯=â€¯25) were aged 13-18 years, mostly female (72%), and African American (56%) or Hispanic (16%) with a BMIâ‰¥95th percenttile (76%). Withdrawal symptoms and SSB craving were assessed approximately 1-week apart, during both regular SSB consumption and a 3-day period of SSB cessation in which participants were instructed to drink only plain milk and water. During SSB cessation, adolescents reported increased SSB cravings and headache and decreased motivation, contentment, ability to concentrate, and overall well-being (uncorrected Psâ€¯<â€¯0.05). After controlling the false discovery rate, changes in motivation, craving, and well-being remained significant (corrected Psâ€¯<â€¯0.05). Using 24-hr recalls and drink journals, participants reported lower total daily consumption of sugar (-80â€¯g) and added sugar (-16â€¯g) (Psâ€¯<â€¯0.001) during cessation. This study provides preliminary evidence of withdrawal symptoms and increased SSB cravings during cessation in a diverse population of overweight or obese adolescents.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer Falbe"", ids = ""6351204""); list(name = ""Hannah R Thompson"", ids = ""143961810""); list(name = ""Anisha Patel"", ids = ""49486044""); list(name = ""Kristine A.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disease are not well understood, particularly in the chronic phase after the initial ischemic episode. In this study, a Macaca fascicularis stroke model consisting of two sample groups, as determined by MRI-quantified infarct volumes as a measure of the stroke severity 28 days after the ischemic episode, was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative proteomics analyses. By using multiple online multidimensional liquid chromatography platforms, 8790 nonredundant proteins were identified that condensed to 5223 protein groups at 1% global false discovery rate (FDR). After the application of a conservative criterion (5% local FDR), 4906 protein groups were identified from the analysis of cerebral cortex. Of the 2068 quantified proteins, differential proteomic analyses revealed that 31 and 23 were dysregulated in the elevated- and low-infarct-volume groups, respectively. Neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and inflammation featured prominently as the cellular processes associated with these dysregulated proteins. Protein interaction network analysis revealed that the dysregulated proteins for inflammation and neurogenesis were highly connected, suggesting potential cross-talk between these processes in modulating the cytoskeletal structure and dynamics in the chronic phase poststroke. Elucidating the long-term consequences of brain tissue injuries from a cellular prospective, as well as the molecular mechanisms that are involved, would provide a basis for the development of new potentially neurorestorative therapies.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Henry Chun Hin Law"", ids = ""2729409""); list(name = ""Samuel S.

bf96c20e3672fb6bed09e9db4b1986f84c61bb6f,inGAP-sv: a novel scheme to identify and visualize structural variation from paired end mapping data,"Mining genetic variation from personal genomes is a crucial step towards investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. However, compared to the detection of SNPs and small indels, characterizing large and particularly complex structural variation is much more difficult and less intuitive. In this article, we present a new scheme (inGAP-sv) to detect and visualize structural variation from paired-end mapping data. Under this scheme, abnormally mapped read pairs are clustered based on the location of a gap signature. Several important features, including local depth of coverage, mapping quality and associated tandem repeat, are used to evaluate the quality of predicted structural variation. Compared with other approaches, it can detect many more large insertions and complex variants with lower false discovery rate. Moreover, inGAP-sv, written in Java programming language, provides a user-friendly interface and can be performed in multiple operating systems.

85fb5a19885f1af6c301de4ee1eba8371debac50,Or14: the Macaque Allele Mamu-a1âˆ—004 Is Functionally Similar to Hla-bâˆ—57,"Aim Rhesus macaques are a commonly used primate model for the study of viral infection. The class I MHC of these animals has been well studied at the genetic level. However functional ligandome characteristics such as peptide binding motif and length distribution have been elucidated in only a handful of macaque MHC (Mamu). Historically, Mamu ligandome characteristics have mimicked HLA-B despite the MAMU-A designation. Here we selected a high-frequency, uncharacterized, allele Mamu-A1âˆ—004:01 to define the ligandome characteristics of this allele for comparison to HLA class I. Method Soluble MAMU-A1âˆ—004:01 and HLA-B57:01 constructs were created and transfected these into the class I deficient cell line 721.221. sMHC harvested from transfected cells was affinity purified and ligand pools were isolated with an acid boil followed by 3Â kDa cut-off ultrafiltration. Ligand pools were separated with two-dimentional LCMS. Data was acquired with a triple TOF mass spectrometer in information-dependant acquisition mode. Peptide sequences from the resulting MS2 fragment spectra were identified using the PEAKS and Mascot algorithms at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 1%. Results In this study, we identified 1447 ligands for Mamu-A1âˆ—004. The peptide binding motif for MAMU-A1âˆ—004 shows the P2 anchor as S, T, A and a PÎ© anchor of W or F. This motif is strikingly similar to the HLA-Bâˆ—57:01 peptide binding motif. Indeed a comparison of the Mamu-A1âˆ—004 and HLA-Bâˆ—57:01 eluted ligands from the same cell line shows that 32% of the Mamu-A1âˆ—004 ligands are shared/identical with HLA-Bâˆ—57:01 ligands. Further, we established a Mamu class I peptide binding assay and demonstrated that known HLA-B57 HIV ligands bind to MAMU-A1âˆ—004 with the same affinities. Although these allomorphs are similar in their motif, the length preferences are different: Compared to HLA-B57, Mamu-A1âˆ—004 prefers nonamers and shows less tolerance for long (>13 amino acids) ligands. Conclusion Here we found that a common Rhesus macaque allele Mamu-A1âˆ—004 is functionally homologous to HLA-Bâˆ—57:01. In humans, HLA-Bâˆ—57:01 is considered to be an important protective allele in HIV infections. These data enable the study of an HLA-Bâˆ—57:01-like molecule in non-human primate models of SIV infection. C. McMurtrey: Consultant; Company/Organization; Pure Protein LLC. R.

ce7d103cacaefe69cce4e9ed6a29e2342a83f551,An exploratory genome-wide analysis of genetic risk for alcoholic hepatitis.,"OBJECTIVES
To elucidate the genetic variability between heavy drinkers with and without alcoholic hepatitis (AH).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An exploratory genome-wide association study (GWAS; NCT02172898) was conducted comparing 90 AH cases with 93 heavy drinking matched controls without liver disease in order to identify variants or genes associated with risk for AH. Individuals were genotyped using the multi-ethnic genotyping array, after which the data underwent conventional quality control. Using bioinformatics tools, pathways associated with AH were explored on the basis of individual variants, and based on genes with a higher 'burden' of functional variation.


RESULTS
Although no single variant reached genome-wide significance, an association signal was observed for PNPLA3 rs738409 (pâ€‰=â€‰.01, OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1), a common single nucleotide polymorphism that has been associated with a variety of liver-related pathologies including alcoholic cirrhosis. Using the improved gene set enrichment analysis for GWAS tool, it was shown that, based on the single variants' trait-association p-values, multiple pathways were associated with risk for AH with high confidence (false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰<â€‰0.05), including several pathways involved in lymphocyte activation and chemokine signaling, which coincides with findings from other research groups. Several Tox Functions and Canonical Pathways were highlighted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, with an especially conspicuous role for pathways related to ethanol degradation, which is not surprising considering the phenotype of the genotyped individuals.


CONCLUSION
This preliminary analysis suggests a role for PNPLA3 variation and several gene sets/pathways that may influence risk for AH among heavy drinkers.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""James J.

Koch","The objective of the present study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling drought-resistance traits at seedling stage of Israeli wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum). Mapping was conducted using an F4 mapping population derived from a cross between genotype WQ23-38 from xeric (Wadi Qilt, 144Â mm annual rainfall) and MA10-30 from mesic (Maalot, 790Â mm annual rainfall) environments. Obvious segregation was observed for traits including time to wilt, leaf relative elongation rate, recovery rate, shoot regrowth, osmolarity, relative water content, leaf length, and root length with the coefficient of variation ranging from 10 to 77%. Eighteen putative QTL effects were identified (at false discovery rateÂ =Â 10%) by single-trait analyses and confirmed by multi-trait analysis and multiple interval mapping using a new MultiQTL package. The results of our study suggest that the xeric genotypes adopted survival strategies while the mesic genotypes adopted growth-sustain strategies to cope with drought stress.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Guoxiong Chen"", ids = ""3947513""); list(name = ""Tamar Krugman"", ids = ""4387034""); list(name = ""Tzion Fahima"", ids = ""3966431""); list(name = ""Kegui Chen"", ids = ""9270660""); list(name = ""Yingang Hu"", ids = ""7741656""); list(name = ""Marion S RÃ¶der"", ids = ""2099872""); list(name = ""Eviatar Nevo"", ids = ""2285010""); list(name = ""Abraham B.

462e24910b71ac2895f18dc46d94237dc20fece0,False discovery rates for large-scale model checking under certain dependence,"ABSTRACT In many scientific fields, it is interesting and important to determine whether an observed data stream comes from a prespecified model or not, particularly when the number of data streams is of large scale, where multiple hypotheses testing is necessary. In this article, we consider large-scale model checking under certain dependence among different data streams observed at the same time. We propose a false discovery rate (FDR) control procedure to check those unusual data streams. Specifically, we derive an approximation of false discovery and construct a point estimate of FDR. Theoretical results show that, under some mild assumptions, our proposed estimate of FDR is simultaneously conservatively consistent with the true FDR, and hence it is an asymptotically strong control procedure. Simulation comparisons with some competing procedures show that our proposed FDR procedure behaves better in general settings. Application of our proposed FDR procedure is illustrated by the StarPlus fMRI data.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lu Deng"", ids = ""145617262""); list(name = ""Xuemin Zi"", ids = ""35915883""); list(name = ""Zhonghua Li"", ids = ""49969946"")",,7c14001e51869d176924a203aa9300882e2fd4ca; b1e31eb818c9553934bc72503f148a47a12dde5c; 7943980f3d381bc4bbe9fef291322e6104f3a157; 3ba66be5277a86e727799fa8341d130100d8e3d6; 3764a8a791d0ecfa58f015790ccfb9eb276ad216; 780212ea3dd8238c83ad11087fa8a8baa4cb5b65; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; c6b3d31741e7e5f68072fd30ba2ce0c9c33e4dd1; 54339edf70fb5eadd89fc609546bc0f5c0a08f59; 6416371037e6d6e602931e9674285f06ca2bb424; 366957d2abaccc0fd221bca33337066484254d16; 7fe59a873246a62128549c29cb3543cb9390f1d5; 7a8b689dc63c230684559ea4c31dfe41b1f6542c; fa8a8018801ae58ade96ea171aca0c34df9f63b0; b232fcace8b5895eee6f29b338d130b458cd7546; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 4dd06b9dc60c703e2d434e2e2248d1d9ab4e0e2d; 69a8ac57d1fb47e08c5da01da5bd84a8f1b3c498; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 08760c1755f5ecff583f428cca0208e5ec1f3edc; 93c6e84247d56cec5479488998481c9f3f825e66; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 781f1bc70fa4188a8b92aeb779ea7c8cd9f54041; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 367c8df35cb753b83151581edd4ca8ddfcc5d2eb,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,47,64 - 79
6a7603ed4c1dd9c91369e285a92e47c647558c40,Reversibility of cerebral blood flow in patients with Cushing's disease after surgery treatment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Cushing's disease (CD) patients have metabolic abnormalities in the brain caused by excessive exposure to endogenous cortisol. However, the reversibility of brain metabolism of CD patients after treatment remains largely unknown.


METHODS
This study recruited 50 CD patients seeking treatment and 34 matched normal controls (NCs). The patients were treated with Transsphenoidal Adenomectomy (TSA) and reexamined 3â€¯months later. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) of the patients were assessed using 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (PCASL) imaging before the treatment and at the 3-month follow-up and were compared with CBF measures of the NCs using a whole-brain voxelwise group comparison method. For remitted patients, their CBF measures and hormone level measures, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 24-h urinary free cortisol (24hUFC) and serum cortisol, were compared before and after the treatment. Finally, a correlation analysis was carried out to explore the relationship between changes of CBF and hormone level measures of the remitted CD patients.


RESULTS
After the treatment, 45 patients reached remission. Compared with the NCs, the CD patients before the treatment exhibited significantly reduced CBF in cortical regions, including occipital lobe, parietal lobe, superior/middle/inferior temporal gyrus, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, precentral gyrus, middle/posterior cingulate gyrus, and rolandic operculum, as well as significantly increased CBF in subcortical structures, including caudate, pallidum, putamen, limbic lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, thalamus, and amygdala (pâ€¯<â€¯.01, false discovery rate corrected). For the remitted patients, the change in CBF before and after the treatment displayed a spatial pattern similar to the difference between the NCs and the CD patients before the treatment, and no significant difference in CBF was observed between the NCs and the remitted CD patients after the treatment.

Exome and genome sequencing are increasingly utilized to diagnose and direct treatment for cancer patients. However, there are many barriers to sequencing cancer exomes in an accurate and comprehensive way that assesses all crucial cancer mutations. Critical sequencing coverage gaps in cancer genes, challenges calling structural variants, difficulty isolating DNA from FFPE and small biopsy samples, tumor heterogeneity and cellularity, and accurate annotation of mutations remain significant hurdles to accurate clinical cancer interpretation. We have developed a comprehensive approach aimed at improving accuracy and completeness of sequencing, structural variant calling, and annotation of cancer samples.

Whole exome sequencing in particular is susceptible to missing key parts of the cancer genome. We have designed a unique targeted assay and set of protocols to augment and improve the standard exome sequencing assay in order to assess all major cancer genome mutations, including important structural variations. We have optimized DNA isolation and library creation from FFPE tumor samples and small sample sizes. To improve sequencing coverage of 494 cancer related genes and over 7,000 other genes of medical importance, we include additional optimized targeted enrichments on top of the standard exome. We also utilize altered sequencing protocols to fill in regions containing genomic elements that are typically hard to sequence by standard protocols. We compared coverage over 494 cancer genes with our augmented exome approach to two different standard exome capture kits, all at 12G of sequencing. In this comparison, we defined â€œfinishingâ€ a gene to mean greater than 99% of bases within the gene at greater than 20x average coverage. Our augmented exome approach finished 459 of 494 (93%) cancer genes. The standard exome platforms only finished 276 (56%) and 318 (64%) cancer genes at this level.

While finishing cancer genes is paramount to detecting small mutations, structural variants (SVs) are also a very important class of mutations when assessing clinical cancer samples. In addition to our augmented exome, we also perform whole genome sequencing to facilitate detection of structural variants. We utilize a combined algorithm for structural variant calling which leverages multiple lines of genomic evidence to identify and score SVs. By combining orthogonal SV detection algorithms with local reassembly, we achieve greater sensitivity (96.27% compared to 55.6% average for each algorithm independently), and a lower false discovery rate (1.37% compared to 27.55% average) on SV detection in genome sequence than any of the methods used independently.

By comprehensively and accurately assessing cancer mutations and leveraging public and privately curated databases for annotation, we are able to sequence and interpret clinical grade cancer exomes to a much higher level than standard exome sequencing.

a8388b0845bab1fd839d3a35c2371d6e50126ce4,Incorporating Phylogenetic Information in Microbiome Differential Abundance Studies Has No Effect on Detection Power and FDR Control,"We consider the problem of incorporating evolutionary information (e.g., taxonomic or phylogenic trees) in the context of metagenomics differential analysis. Recent results published in the literature propose different ways to leverage the tree structure to increase the detection rate of differentially abundant taxa. Here, we propose instead to use a different hierarchical structure, in the form of a correlation-based tree, as it may capture the structure of the data better than the phylogeny. We first show that the correlation tree and the phylogeny are significantly different before turning to the impact of tree choice on detection rates. Using synthetic data, we show that the tree does have an impact: smoothing p-values according to the phylogeny leads to equal or inferior rates as smoothing according to the correlation tree. However, both trees are outperformed by the classical, non-hierarchical, Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (BH) procedure in terms of detection rates. Other procedures may use the hierarchical structure with profit but do not control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) a priori and remain inferior to a classical Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure with the same nominal FDR. On real datasets, no hierarchical procedure had significantly higher detection rate that BH. Intuition advocates that the use of hierarchical structures should increase the detection rate of differentially abundant taxa in microbiome studies. However, our results suggest that current hierarchical procedures are still inferior to standard methods and more effective procedures remain to be invented.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Antoine Bichat"", ids = ""1576544538""); list(name = ""Jonathan Plassais"", ids = ""50552433""); list(name = ""Christophe Ambroise"", ids = ""2952661""); list(name = ""Mahendra Mariadassou"", ids = ""1863118"")",,74698555e6575693541b0b8573e34e7393893849; c97638e535d5d9a87f6c8deb38c06c2b7e922c61; 35fb143b230377d47214c09a7ce0608357afeb6b; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; 10174625a5fa0348320994d31a5d51e329c75e08; 257697c50105f0681495c625e15b75e3b95d193c; 4dc5a37d61e7dbd4d3d55f8679209e022ea09473; 07cf9752417c8ba856ecbb4f6cc5bd8833200dff; 8237cfbe8f1a0b8ed5b57b4cbf4e43e3708b449b; 75c4e675027dfda388b2d29509e2597742f00cbf; d293befcf9afdb25f0de2f74ff12e34978455ca9; 9526214b21a2acee1af70ed6a62e386306a98989; 3519d16aa6cc859dd77824b8195ff1ccd9ae5f92; 6e4f63bef83267839b36b67ee5e6f0772846018e; 9fd3b1d0325fe125b2642b85b43a7ffc615bf840; bd67404e2e31293cb13d9cfdd9b0aaf1b79a2831; 430c5e6f0fb43860d3d6b9cfba35ff6b78fded53; 733958e3fc5a21b3c89d6f88bf3b0fa2b1caa0ad; d5677974ad0a645fbb71a6dc0355c54005239882; 9c50c0bd263f181d4c2ff74b99f433cc2c6b1066; 61076194ec631a89daa30edbcc90bc7be37804cc; 0013c4d46e4e9a9ad4f69f5e294e21cbd8266e2c; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; de6c025dbb37afe5041d1f7d0343c1db48869bfc; 5025c942b1c5ac33ce4e0996bef72493d7b118b2; c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf; 04eb70a9f832a9879841135bf051c8b1ec9d3010; f64dd54444a724574deb7710888091350eebb2b9; d898f2d6b3b98340ed97da0a064208b9b9bb67ab; 72a60a8c5ea2635b4536e2924cf222084f528b16; 83939f37c4792e9edf0437f2928fa46a44aac016; 0a2b7701fb57b76da0738d56856b5e83aa983744; d708571991b4dcf16909e8de51aa9b4c8fa26984; c82e6dbd5b34d1ebc435c81a0e5bb774a6f7b998; 390d3b435a8073f389407e9a6e65bad9dc923413; 0c5520f0980ebbae1273bc5a51b50afb03901944; 060fbb7ae458fa71a477ff22f825b6c06344b773; 232db55ff77c0a9fb991a6660a75ea03bbe3c2b9; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a; c52792297ecf26f0e161004cc86667f4130b2cd3; e0cc897e18346ee423ac1675ffc9cce185622c7e; 703c7d4cab8a9c2f8e65bb33ea48d565dd60c567; 075147bad63d8e465892f729f2876c6ecae89e84; 30bcf9f512e9af5089108acf5c4183b21dfd77e9; 5d5319e1133ee105d83e07da567ee288b7851d09; 4ead4d868721e8b38c266415a1f6201cd147a78a; f46c758d007ec833cb86132a789d5778d0d7687f; 842074f879730589df9d2e9d5589100eeb66ca14; 9efd70d2c06733704220313fb67720aa45c6362a; 36dd56a56bd679050812e6ac2b402e6f0c1729ab; 79d096e7a00d73ce2fbc134273c6b8abfe51f2ee; b695cb5a9718ca530aba8b2a2174657d4996d4e8,Frontiers in Microbiology,11,
30384711402c64b416e0091b173d1b8e8858f06d,Changes in skeletal muscle gene expression following clenbuterol administration,"BackgroundBeta-adrenergic receptor agonists (BA) induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy, yet specific mechanisms that lead to this effect are not well understood. The objective of this research was to identify novel genes and physiological pathways that potentially facilitate BA induced skeletal muscle growth. The Affymetrix platform was utilized to identify gene expression changes in mouse skeletal muscle 24 hours and 10 days after administration of the BA clenbuterol.ResultsAdministration of clenbuterol stimulated anabolic activity, as indicated by decreased blood urea nitrogen (BUN; P < 0.01) and increased body weight gain (P < 0.05) 24 hours or 10 days, respectively, after initiation of clenbuterol treatment. A total of 22,605 probesets were evaluated with 52 probesets defined as differentially expressed based on a false discovery rate of 10%. Differential mRNA abundance of four of these genes was validated in an independent experiment by quantitative PCR. Functional characterization of differentially expressed genes revealed several categories that participate in biological processes important to skeletal muscle growth, including regulators of transcription and translation, mediators of cell-signalling pathways, and genes involved in polyamine metabolism.ConclusionGlobal evaluation of gene expression after administration of clenbuterol identified changes in gene expression and overrepresented functional categories of genes that may regulate BA-induced muscle hypertrophy. Changes in mRNA abundance of multiple genes associated with myogenic differentiation may indicate an important effect of BA on proliferation, differentiation, and/or recruitment of satellite cells into muscle fibers to promote muscle hypertrophy. Increased mRNA abundance of genes involved in the initiation of translation suggests that increased levels of protein synthesis often associated with BA administration may result from a general up-regulation of translational initiators. Additionally, numerous other genes and physiological pathways were identified that will be important targets for further investigations of the hypertrophic effect of BA on skeletal muscle.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Diane Moody Spurlock"", ids = ""144011107""); list(name = ""Tara G.

Single gene analysis is insufficient to describe the complex perturbations responsible for cancer onset, progression and invasion.Objective: To identify gene pathways of highly hypermethylated genes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) using DNA microarray-based methylation profiling. The study focused on the deregulation of gene sets or pathways rather than on individual genes involved in carcinogenesis mechanisms. Methods: DNA methylation assay was carried out on bisulfite-converted DNA extracted from frozen section tissues of 3 normal subjects and 20 patients of OSCC, using Illumina Infinium Methylation assay. 20620 genes of raw data obtained were normalized and analyzed using Genome Studio software. Significant methylated genes were generated by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), with less than 25% false discovery rate and 0.05 of nominal p-value were applied in gene pathway analysis. Results: High quality bisulfite-converted DNA was obtained and the methylation array was successfully run on all samples. In unsupervised cluster analysis, the normal subject samples were cluster differently from OSCC cases with false discovery rate in p-value of less than 0.05 and fold change more than 2.0. 113 hypermethylated genes were generated by GSEA where 18 hypermethylated genes are involved in pancreatic cancer, 42 in cell cycle, 20 in apoptosis, 15 in chronic myeloid leukemia, 7 in bladder cancer and 9 in non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusions: Based on the data analysis, the hypermethylated genes found on these pathways are related the cancer-causing mechanisms.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Kwai Lin Thong"", ids = ""3410535""); list(name = ""Goot Heah Khor"", ids = ""39594053""); list(name = ""Rosnah Binti Zain"", ids = ""2641824"")",4a2770686dc55776c294f30291c45cee2074222e; 49a20451ffdc631d9171ff5c7f052362855220c4,,,,
d07753fad3b1c25412ff7536176f54577604b1a1,Automated Threshold Selection for Extreme Value Analysis via Goodness-of-Fit Tests with Application to Batched Return Level Mapping,"Threshold selection is a critical issue for extreme value analysis with threshold-based approaches. Under suitable conditions, exceedances over a high threshold have been shown to follow the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) asymptotically. In practice, however, the threshold must be chosen. If the chosen threshold is too low, the GPD approximation may not hold and bias can occur. If the threshold is chosen too high, reduced sample size increases the variance of parameter estimates. To process batch analyses, commonly used selection methods such as graphical diagnosis are subjective and cannot be automated, while computational methods may not be feasible. We propose to test a set of thresholds through the goodness-of-fit of the GPD for the exceedances, and select the lowest one, above which the data provides adequate fit to the GPD. Previous attempts in this setting are not valid due to the special feature that the multiple tests are done in an ordered fashion. We apply two recently available stopping rules that control the false discovery rate or familywise error rate to ordered goodness-of-fit tests to automate threshold selection. Various model specification tests such as the CramÃ©râ€“von Mises, Andersonâ€“Darling, Moranâ€™s, and a score test are investigated. The performance of the method is assessed in a large scale simulation study that mimics practical return level estimation. This procedure was repeated at hundreds of sites in the western US to generate return level maps of extreme precipitation.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Brian Bader"", ids = ""50739618""); list(name = ""Jun Yan"", ids = ""46758576""); list(name = ""Xuebin Zhang"", ids = ""3133825"")",34ba28461c0a6e9305da6fbb128327683fa9a2dc,e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 42b5cefeb0ce0c3cbbb8ec94a47fd293bce31e36; 1cd3eb867a5e8fa3f5e0c57c6c9822c9e3a3f44b; 6558998c0ab095d04d2fdb2a0693e6fbc50fd2a4; 57a3c9cf9e7de0779f3bfe4afe73976bd52a0309; b98646e58f6a5cd8a0f0cb96577409ed9008b1ea; 8fb069aa8d4bd99bba177ddac5a26efbae9e6847; 799d5b0a3f01e860d77d68ce7f6ec381820151af; e28993f9e1cc7a0f38dd99ba50c620136235a9af; 7143212116434f940fee18ee48ac6d725afbe3fe; 90b67083c76276cb8a605904bf139f37a0a9ae70; 59ad9c4fc0f555e45a8390566788e03201ae347b; 2fb5f8ec6ac6a8ef4bcf6f6add2526a769eee3a2; 7350548ffcfb7ee6b2d6b2590edc9e8333fa9158; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; fbf9861cfbc92f18a2533d8efbf8b4251aeb7d32; 655e203a5a0140790ac6da6eea0c77bb8098afe2; 4f98f4928b226a4bf5fcc66f9cabaf992a0e1a83; 3e5e0b24c9b4ab975fd093459a636a3020bc22d2; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; f1eb9a41d8041da263c050f89e246f7c3fb37d95; fad70ca3799b1093318a795568a9d3d454674990; c1dfa0831c53d66076fba42f09076126882759ea; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 90d81f8659d4e9e8caccae7c6730f3cd55678517; aceccedd609979051e75023ccbaaf71e8174b5bd; 89ef70f38737e75ad27598af7b2185abb5ef11cc; 13f759a3a456941fe78442a258e635a2b544aee2; c1b953bedc170ca7f209d0bb22aa60c08d30f0ca; a913ecbe7a3ccbfbc6a96b75d4dd84273309f61f; cab70e5e207e4ce1ae208755faaaf878a7855f0b; 92c558e2cf16f27f82269dbbae6b49eb45acb76f; 11fd4057a03d2896bbc9f585a4f2df845d039fca; 830596423c670263ce4befec2c5c85189b4d660f; e4aa873b4e101237a5dc5a7d3b5c6c5af817d500; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; e0dc256940006a74f6be9f71af59efdfd47c7d4f; eaabef5260b92ac34f77b11ecf1ebc0831460eb9; 238c138104cdeb898255481a7c39d021aecdf198,,,

DNA methylation has been implicated in the pathology of obesity, but little is known about such epigenetic variants in Chinese people. We conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of methylation at CpG sites in relation to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) among Chinese adult populations.


METHODS
469 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry were the discovery cohort. After quality control, methylation levels in whole blood leukocyte DNA were tested for association with BMI, WC, and WHR using mixed linear regressions, adjusting for demographics, lifestyle, and family structure. Methylation sites at a false discovery rate (FDR) q value of 0Â·05 or less were selected for replication in four independent panels of general populations: Dongfeng-tongji cohort (n=688), Coke Oven Workers (n=137), Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort (n=241), and Shiyan participants (n=144). Association of obesity traits with the selected CpG sites in each replication panel was examined using linear regressions with adjustment of covariates similar to that in the discovery cohort, and results were combined using fixed effect meta-analysis with significance level penalised by Bonferroni correction. All participants gave written informed consent, and the Peking University Biomedical Ethics Committee approved the study protocol.


FINDINGS
Methylation levels at 6, 3, and 1 CpG sites were significantly associated with BMI, WC, and WHR, respectively in discovery cohort (FDR q value range 0Â·0010-0Â·0443); these findings were replicated by meta-analysis in the four panels. We found associations between obesity traits and methylation at genes CPT1A (meta-analysis p=0Â·0013 for BMI, p=0Â·0047 for WC, and p=0Â·0178 for WHR), ABCG1 (p<0Â·0001 for BMI and WC) and SREBF1 (p<0Â·0001 for BMI). Additionally, CpG sites at gene ARID1B (meta-analysis effect size Î² -0Â·0221, 95% CI -0Â·0363 to -0Â·0079, p=0Â·0022 for BMI), gene TOP1 (-0Â·0237, -0Â·0404 to -0Â·0071, p=0Â·0053 for BMI), and methylation site cg17061862 (-0Â·0379, -0Â·0575 to -0Â·018, p=0Â·0002 for BMI; -0Â·0356, -0Â·0608 to -0Â·0103, p=0Â·0057 for WC) showed inverse associations with BMI or WC.


INTERPRETATION
Our findings support the association of DNA methylation at CPT1A, ABCG1, and SREBF1 with obesity traits in Chinese populations. We identified additional associated methylation sites at genes ARID1B and TOP1 and at cg17061862.

274127ec730f7f9af2713bd5fe14bb9836f4bc79,A multi-ancestry genome-wide study incorporating gene-smoking interactions identifies multiple new loci for pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure.,"Elevated blood pressure (BP), a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, is influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors. Cigarette smoking is one such lifestyle factor. Across five ancestries, we performed a genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in 129â€‰913 individuals in stage 1 and follow-up analysis in 480â€‰178 additional individuals in stage 2. We report here 136 loci significantly associated with MAP and/or PP. Of these, 61 were previously published through main-effect analysis of BP traits, 37 were recently reported by us for systolic BP and/or diastolic BP through gene-smoking interaction analysis and 38 were newly identified (Pâ€‰<â€‰5â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8, false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). We also identified nine new signals near known loci. Of the 136 loci, 8 showed significant interaction with smoking status. They include CSMD1 previously reported for insulin resistance and BP in the spontaneously hypertensive rats. Many of the 38 new loci show biologic plausibility for a role in BP regulation. SLC26A7 encodes a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger expressed in the renal outer medullary collecting duct. AVPR1A is widely expressed, including in vascular smooth muscle cells, kidney, myocardium and brain. FHAD1 is a long non-coding RNA overexpressed in heart failure. TMEM51 was associated with contractile function in cardiomyocytes. CASP9 plays a central role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Identified only in African ancestry were 30 novel loci. Our findings highlight the value of multi-ancestry investigations, particularly in studies of interaction with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle differences may contribute to novel findings.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yun Ju Sung"", ids = ""143782215""); list(name = ""Lisa de las Fuentes"", ids = ""151376291""); list(name = ""Thomas W.

In addition, there are far fewer validation experiments reported than discovery experiments. It has been suggested that one reason for this slow progress is a lack of application of standard concepts in experimental design. One such concept is the determination of sample size a priori to ensure that powerful investigations are undertaken, where there is a good chance of a difference being observed if one truly exists. 
 
Proteomic experiments raise challenges in sample size determination due to their megavariate nature and inherent biological and technical variation. However, it is possible to determine sample size for investigations which seek to identify diagnostic, predictive and prognostic biomarkers. This can be undertaken by combining tools to control the expected false discovery rate, appropriate sample size formulae and simulation. A flexible protocol is described that allows the determination of sample size for a variety of proteomic biomarker discovery and validation experiments. These allow the determination of appropriate sample sizes to conduct suitably powerful experiments. It is possible that the application of such techniques could lead to more robust discoveries being validated and enter clinical practice, after appropriate evaluation.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer H.

However, drug resistance has become a major impediment to the successful treatment of ovarian cancer. To date, the molecular mechanisms of resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy remain unclear. In this study, we applied an LC/MS-based protein quantification method to examine the global protein expression of two pairs of ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780/A2780-CP (cisplatin-sensitive/cisplatin-resistant) and 2008/2008-C13*5.25 (cisplatin-sensitive/cisplatin-resistant). We identified and quantified over 2000 proteins from these cell lines and 760 proteins showed significant expression changes with a false discovery rate of less than 5% between paired groups. Based on the results we obtained, we suggest several potential pathways that may be involved in cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer. This study provides not only a new proteomic platform for large-scale quantitative protein analysis, but also important information for discovery of potential biomarkers of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, these results may be clinically relevant for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic improvement for ovarian cancer treatment.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dawn P. G.

There is currently a lack of statistical methods which properly address multiple testing, i.e. control genome-wide significance for differentially methylated regions. We introduce a scan statistic (DMRScan), which overcomes these limitations. We benchmark DMRScan against two well established methods (bumphunter, DMRcate), using a simulation study based on real methylation data. An implementation of DMRScan is available from Bioconductor. Our method has higher power than alternative methods across different simulation scenarios, particularly for small effect sizes. DMRScan exhibits greater flexibility in statistical modeling and can be used with more complex designs than current methods. DMRScan is the first dynamic approach which properly addresses the multiple-testing challenges for the identification of differently methylated regions. DMRScan outperformed alternative methods in terms of power, while keeping the false discovery rate controlled.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Magnus Page"", ids = ""38891554""); list(name = ""Linda Vos"", ids = ""34428495""); list(name = ""Trine B.

5a8e6a69970cd0a4db9475b48c9eed82079632d0,Integrated analysis reveals five potential ceRNA biomarkers in human lung adenocarcinoma,"Background
Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are a newly identified type of regulatory RNA. Accumulating evidence suggests that ceRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Thus, ceRNA dysregulation may represent an important molecular mechanism underlying cancer progression and poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed to identify ceRNAs that may serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).


Methods
We performed differential gene expression analysis on TCGA-LUAD datasets to identify differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs at different tumor stages. Based on the ceRNA hypothesis and considering the synergistic or feedback regulation of ceRNAs, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Functional analysis was performed using gene ontology term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and KOBAS 2.0 software. Transcription factor (TF) analysis was carried out to identify direct targets of the TFs associated with LUAD prognosis. Identified DE genes were validated using gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets.


Results
Based on analysis of TCGA-LUAD datasets, we obtained 2,610 DE mRNAs, 915 lncRNAs, and 125 miRNAs that were common to different tumor stages (|log2(Fold change)| â‰¥ 1, false discovery rate < 0.01), respectively. Functional analysis showed that the aberrantly expressed mRNAs were closely related to tumor development. Survival analyses of the constructed ceRNA network modules demonstrated that five of them exhibit prognostic significance. The five ceRNA interaction modules contained one lncRNA (FENDRR), three mRNAs (EPAS1, FOXF1, and EDNRB), and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-148a, hsa-miR-195, hsa-miR-196b, and hsa-miR-301b). The aberrant expression of one lncRNA and three mRNAs was verified in the LUAD GEO dataset. Transcription factor analysis demonstrated that EPAS1 directly targeted 13 DE mRNAs.

Limited studies were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism of hip articular cartilage damage in NFH. We conducted genome-wide gene expression profiling of hip articular cartilage with NFH.MethodsHip articular cartilage specimens were collected from 18 NFH patients and 18 healthy controls. Gene expression profiling of NFH articular cartilage was carried out by Agilent Human 4x44K Gene Expression Microarray chip. Differently expressed genes were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) software. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differently expressed genes was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Significantly differently expressed genes in the microarray experiment were selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical validation.ResultsSAM identified 27 differently expressed genes in NFH articular cartilage, functionally involved in extracellular matrix, cytokines, growth factors, cell cycle and apoptosis. The expression patterns of the nine validation genes in qRT-PCR were consistent with that in proteinaceous extracellular matrix (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰3.22â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5), extracellular matrix (FDRâ€‰=â€‰5.78â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5), extracellular region part (FDRâ€‰=â€‰1.28â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4), collagen (FDRâ€‰=â€‰3.22â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4), extracellular region (FDRâ€‰=â€‰4.78â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4) and platelet-derived growth factor binding (FDRâ€‰=â€‰5.23â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4).ConclusionsThis study identified a set of differently expressed genes, implicated in articular cartilage damage in NFH.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the gut, partly driven by defects in the innate immune system. Considering the central role of inflammasome signaling in innate immunity, we studied inflammasome components in IBD mucosa.


METHODS
Expression of genes encoding inflammasome sensor subunits was investigated in colonic mucosal biopsies from 2 cohorts of patients with IBD and controls.


RESULTS
A significant upregulation (>2-fold change in expression, false discovery rate <0.05) of the PYHIN inflammasomes AIM2 and IFI16 in active IBD versus controls was found. Also IFI16 was significantly increased in inactive IBD versus controls. Moreover, responders to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy showed decreased expression of these inflammasomes although IFI16 remained significantly increased in responders showing endoscopic healing versus controls. AIM2 was mainly expressed in epithelial cells, whereas IFI16 was expressed in both lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Functional activation of predominant AIM2/IFI16-mediated inflammasomes in active IBD colon was shown by the presence of the downstream effectors CASP1 and HMGB-1 in inflamed mucosa.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results highlight the importance of PYHIN inflammasome signaling in IBD and also link anti-tumor necrosis factor responsiveness to inflammasome signaling. Together, this points to the potential value of the inflammasome pathway as a new therapeutic target for IBD treatment.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wiebe Vanhove"", ids = ""40469517""); list(name = ""Paul M.G.J.

41f41a837fa54d7e60d945a377acdf4b27a7e268,Spatial Multiresolution Cluster Detection Method,"A novel multi-resolution cluster detection (MCD) method is proposed to identify irregularly shaped clusters in space. Multi-scale test statistic on a single cell is derived based on likelihood ratio statistic for Bernoulli sequence, Poisson sequence and Normal sequence. A neighborhood variability measure is defined to select the optimal test threshold. The MCD method is compared with single scale testing methods controlling for false discovery rate and the spatial scan statistics using simulation and f-MRI data. The MCD method is shown to be more effective for discovering irregularly shaped clusters, and the implementation of this method does not require heavy computation, making it suitable for cluster detection for large spatial data.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lingsong Zhang"", ids = ""2105474""); list(name = ""Zhengyuan Zhu"", ids = ""2741352"")",c380d2523a2c63504c99761c67b76bfc2b7b1000; f6ccb158edc68cd538fc28242d44a3d3158f4f89,9580eb057afe5b97bd2fa46678c530a05484c756; 2bf6e4e4a72648c6fcc2e8a08aec1d8c94c051fa; 367ec267cb17f90537570f47104122f610eb2c9a; c55dfe48a3c49a6dc366d50a60521f73aa31151a; 6666641c7fbb18677a515753774fe69a8854734d; 3350ef8df45d048bc2c64ec98dd8a346bb98e49f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 917eb6b776a9b44efe8ca70a790f7dae7f8248a7; 7178704289158cd9edf3fc13dd8f5f78b6e60db9; be41de49cd212a09408c593cab20e099f5440591; c4facda9a91fea8fa08f6e4559d585605622d905; 80734be3328f28e4babe8832e608a33bb768a838; 40cd993e952600de7f086a600301857208d97de5; 0d8e4c8fd5344ed93053ac511c143f8bbb26b57e; 418c2ea875050242f364f01ef97f1daf82aa8b3e; 0870cfa50b9731d32993e4a6d8006fc63c94fec5; 0df63d717912ba0a44b7947104684beb4fb9f8d2; 8044033378158ed3e32a123861eff12c3fa47413; e8f2e53edf7e509fbe112c651a2febb29deb0dc6; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d939b650b725d6ed7117850250488590b2cc92be; 4345b170e063b7c853ebc7250025d03d3b84cd22; 288d81f1b0de1c7faf9ead9c1c606a41168f5d21; 42d1ab81fee33944a965d44b0b6a9a95efe55453,arXiv: Methodology,,65-77
83bf6fc7311056768468c7e0bb4baa5b512c621f,Systematic Analysis of Cell-Type Differences in the Epithelial Secretome Reveals Insights into the Pathogenesis of Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Induced Lower Respiratory Tract Infections.,"Lower respiratory tract infections from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are due, in part, to secreted signals from lower airway cells that modify the immune response and trigger airway remodeling. To understand this process, we applied an unbiased quantitative proteomics analysis of the RSV-induced epithelial secretory response in cells representative of the trachea versus small airway bronchiolar cells. A workflow was established using telomerase-immortalized human epithelial cells that revealed highly reproducible cell type-specific differences in secreted proteins and nanoparticles (exosomes). Approximately one third of secretome proteins are exosomal; the remainder are from lysosomal and vacuolar compartments. We applied this workflow to three independently derived primary human cultures from trachea versus bronchioles. A total of 577 differentially expressed proteins from control supernatants and 966 differentially expressed proteins from RSV-infected cell supernatants were identified at a 1% false discovery rate. Fifteen proteins unique to RSV-infected primary human cultures from trachea were regulated by epithelial-specific ets homologous factor. A total of 106 proteins unique to RSV-infected human small airway epithelial cells was regulated by the transcription factor NF-ÎºB. In this latter group, we validated the differential expression of CCL20/macrophage-inducible protein 3Î±, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and CCL3-like 1 because of their roles in Th2 polarization. CCL20/macrophage-inducible protein 3Î± was the most active mucin-inducing factor in the RSV-infected human small airway epithelial cell secretome and was differentially expressed in smaller airways in a mouse model of RSV infection. These studies provide insights into the complexity of innate responses and regional differences in the epithelial secretome participating in RSV lower respiratory tract infection-induced airway remodeling.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yingxin Zhao"", ids = ""2818173""); list(name = ""Mohammad Jamaluddin"", ids = ""145282544""); list(name = ""Yueqing Zhang"", ids = ""46868569""); list(name = ""Hong Sun"", ids = ""145687895""); list(name = ""Teodora Ivanciuc"", ids = ""47163462""); list(name = ""Roberto P Garofalo"", ids = ""3189673""); list(name = ""Allan R Brasier"", ids = ""40529183"")",0d45b299f1be79aa97cb2a4bc6a0553e811e4d04; deea74c59b21622d228c43adea5340e8a2447081; 44c83b35bf67631e33d6529fdf1eb14eaa608935; aa1dbdf98406a1ff73669c8ac3be1ba537eb7918; 345ea37fb7e7586001ff4b7d64ceba77563412db,b6321e3a1734c1d18f78419ea30bff7f32fd5523; 4cc52d021f16c71b3896682b3ba1c36008525960; e315d27674ce4c01677dc33fcfd6423d437dfc6f; f546aa2b3cd0449134343ed4fefa9276f18948bd; 912b19c1a603e3e11b8493e128122b479ae346f0; 25fa08d2f60ac8900f46247ef73a9c8f8d2060b1; d413146587f9a63622c81a0d51702d05430ca36c; 8b426fda7b74a8ff7707ba12e9c894d3da8b6da0; 1e6bb2d20376c840d1368fa6791f098d3e3e3db0; 237d5b21ba0e75ceb20f84dec6d607bc35013015; c8ccdf242b111dd04ac2aa6d319015c67d54aab7; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 315e05b0b70437ddf56976d8890cc347b89cbfde; c30b556363de6ef255b0a68fb7700271a0c8796f; 3d764a187aa61b74b6365efca84100b55f430892; 81a0bccc609e2b4561fe2cd7c402f0ab07ea7c4c; 742453ee67cda1895df77142051a4036ec8e28af; 52cdc185861eac01e974e2a6cbd62fba2a109a6e; 05465478cdaee6cc1f1e7aebaf2d18be6f6f02ca; d6e708153e1093ddd52f60f2b11099481d612a38; 11b24116b08a1b4f1f36381d87500c8e7c7c5660; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; ef78edec9e6a053c2b47805198edde105d222dd5; 0c836eb24065cb94c3ccaa319e585bf44a89d469; 65123a3d66c02179ced3f0d03e471362569aac2d; ed71988dac1ba5e0f16f09b04e46fe48dd2ed0b6; f72802dcebf912673e4c1dec850f7e4c89601eae; bec839c94d3ad9c7aa28cc0ee2ec0e206609916b; 7a44365e3d316a9f423132a39f64df8a885427b3; d436337ee88d9bcbb4b57573125559be1486ef69; 6a968a1367365addddde11f8a42f8cb873278ba7; 496d1a7ffd07e4d6ffe0067cac5329cf0a6b25ea; 103821655e6c0b67551a70b590eb44c41f3800d5; b904f5239607689bdff7c8ad82084c3ccf280964; 588ca7b5f5e45fbf1abe0ca8a372bd3696a62c41; 1e2258ab25511086bf7e2155fc49c3ffa39e0628; 0e889499611f845ecfb36e256cef7f6e531951f3; 0bbb6161fcda935a3a26dea80df5d713362d9016; 4748e5e6ba3b25823a00dd54473bd4b67da75f87; fce4629f51bf85e4be489ee89b7f98361e818a5d; 1e3b33cf6c8081101903fdbafc6c2140f941833b; b39b016fe047bca377a2168a7fa428c97e23b158; 8f1eafeb2606eafd893b05aaa2f15c277e2ae6a5; 297239aa1700387986e549bbe744456f8b6d260a; af9c4866b7678ac2c68a5e37c9b9970bd8fa4ad6; 63a3f57f754468a3480880b6fb6d8f2c93159c0a; 044c48437c05225a4438cdcb8fdb2ccc53d8d3d4; 914cc39c68994aa9aca6fd3174013b09eb398bdd; 89d55b3b03e82cbcb166f9b0b4681e59bf3412d7; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 00bab7496f80251b9e22237b0329e9b89445a35e; dc7f01616aea5d85e594d6b9d1113ca3bb292d28; f5689bd2fd80b79e1c165bee5a87c4423c44222a; 7d66662b4448e098582fb9d42170f6b0fbd44298; 9c0749befb9c7ff2c603809b001ebea6c553a130; efe199369ae9221114f3b4e648208e828ac323d9; 25e5d92e986ae47a38fd62ef6077bd7b809b3433; 630120eec69a77a3496568a4e38d3a32491d86c1; ed08c5645581cc7fd117868e765d332bbe1ea8d4; 8fb2d5c7e14e63b4886304d1e204545073652a49; 9ac3e53f7c67446a2d637d3769ee5723e8ca311a; 35b21c22736ffbc4225070cf92ba0e7e50df5938; 89a82d6b07369d176be766c14e221e813d7cf7f0; 869731b3c6fd9014356dbe3fc40a8bb648dbe2fb; f5bdb364da5fa5fba195a79576ab4490daabe731; 94b5dd556afaeb337fc4a4157a0ad7628faaab63; 3974c590e09a851564ae9882cae84e86bf380503; f7b5bf8c3e45f1a22c99a6a4860bdc6095ca76de; 5b4dcae10294c76465e74f3a37a2bceaceab9e8c; 8112b8aadc5d421755834e2d6584bc515353750a; 562a55b06ab8ca583b26005a910f0720e8163114; 148f0cb994d2615f5b960d4713ccfb03caf922e1; a316b389da1d75c758992474dcaa5722386243ed; a77eeaff857782cde461b64b60346824db389ecc; cb3a4715befc36854a36672aa62d2905b46955c2; edd6d9003bd31e36ad6d2da261099fbc076a4234; ba2f5300070c1f6b86320f91dfb825084ea7f8f8; b14c208d7f4e6e8eb1fa607b22055b80b8716d0b; 1d1e97beb234fad5e162c56dddd96d9badabb87b,Journal of immunology,198 8,"

db90b6fcc6ad78afdb4806a02d102e425dc073b5,A Genetic Response Score for Hydrochlorothiazide Use: Insights From Genomics and Metabolomics Integration.,"Hydrochlorothiazide is among the most commonly prescribed antihypertensives; yet, <50% of hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients achieve blood pressure (BP) control. Herein, we integrated metabolomic and genomic profiles of hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients to identify novel genetic markers associated with hydrochlorothiazide BP response. The primary analysis included 228 white hypertensives treated with hydrochlorothiazide from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) study. Genome-wide analysis was conducted using Illumina Omni 1 mol/L-Quad Chip, and untargeted metabolomics was performed on baseline fasting plasma samples using a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry platform. We found 13 metabolites significantly associated with hydrochlorothiazide systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) responses (false discovery rate, <0.05). In addition, integrating genomic and metabolomic data revealed 3 polymorphisms (rs2727563 PRKAG2, rs12604940 DCC, and rs13262930 EPHX2) along with arachidonic acid, converging in the netrin signaling pathway (P=1Ã—10(-5)), as potential markers, significantly influencing hydrochlorothiazide BP response. We successfully replicated the 3 genetic signals in 212 white hypertensives treated with hydrochlorothiazide and created a response score by summing their BP-lowering alleles. We found patients carrying 1 response allele had a significantly lower response than carriers of 6 alleles (âˆ†SBP/âˆ†DBP: -1.5/1.2 versus -16.3/-10.4 mmâ€‰Hg, respectively, SBP score, P=1Ã—10(-8) and DBP score, P=3Ã—10(-9)). This score explained 11.3% and 11.9% of the variability in hydrochlorothiazide SBP and DBP responses, respectively, and was further validated in another independent study of 196 whites treated with hydrochlorothiazide (DBP score, P=0.03; SBP score, P=0.07). This study suggests that PRKAG2, DCC, and EPHX2 might be important determinants of hydrochlorothiazide BP response.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohamed Hossam A.

77de196221da344b42c974a1a0edcb21820d0fd1,A comparative study of clustering and classification algorithms,"Clustering and Classification are two of the most common data mining tasks, used frequently for data categorization and analysis in both industry and academia. Clustering is the process of organizing unlabeled objects into groups of which members are similar in some way. Clustering is a kind of unsupervised learning algorithm. It does not use category labels when grouping objects. In Semi-Supervised clustering, some prior knowledge is available either in the form of labeled data or pair-wise constraints on some of the objects. Classification is a kind of supervised learning algorithm. It is a procedure to assign class labels. A classifier is constructed from the labeled training data using certain classification algorithm, it then will be used to predict the class label of the test data. 
In this dissertation, the results of a comprehensive comparative study of three kinds of clustering algorithms including Co-Clustering, Consensus-based Clustering and Semi-supervised Clustering is presented. Through experiments using artificial datasets with different data substructures and UCI data sets, the performance of the three kinds of clustering algorithms was compared and analyzed. A method was proposed to combine a Co-Clustering algorithm and a Semi-supervised Clustering algorithm. A comprehensive comparative study was conducted on three kinds of classification algorithms including Logistic Regression Classifier, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree. Experiments were carried out using different artificial datasets and UCI data sets to analyze and compare their classification performance. A method using controlled False Discovery Rate was proposed in Logistic Regression Classifier to select important features. A detailed proof was developed to show that controlling False Discovery Rate can be achieved by controlling the related p-value. Experiments were also conducted to compare the classification performance using the proposed feature selection algorithm.

1a271af17e632d0b12f0510a83959aca814ea9da,Improving qualitative and quantitative performance for MS(E)-based label-free proteomics.,"Label-free quantitation by data independent methods (for instance MS(E)) is growing in popularity due to the high technical reproducibility of mass spectrometry analysis. The recent introduction of Synapt hybrid instruments capable of incorporating ion mobility separation within mass spectrometry analysis now allows acquisition of high definition MS(E) data (HDMS(E)). HDMS(E) enables deeper proteome coverage and more confident peptide identifications when compared to MS(E), while the latter offers a higher dynamic range for quantitation. We have developed synapter as, a versatile tool to better evaluate the results of data independent acquisitions on Waters instruments. We demonstrate that synapter can be used to combine HDMS(E) and MS(E) data to achieve deeper proteome coverage delivered by HDMS(E) and more accurate quantitation for high intensity peptides, delivered by MS(E). For users who prefer to run samples exclusively in one mode, synapter allows other useful functionality like false discovery rate estimation, filtering on peptide match type and mass error, and filling missing values. Our software integrates with existing tools, thus permitting us to easily combine peptide quantitation information into protein quantitation by a range of different approaches.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicholas J.

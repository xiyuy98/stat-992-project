62ac7491486cd7085dd88d0c7996db6f9186dd07,A permutation-based non-parametric analysis of CRISPR screen data,"BackgroundClustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens are usually implemented in cultured cells to identify genes with critical functions. Although several methods have been developed or adapted to analyze CRISPR screening data, no single specific algorithm has gained popularity. Thus, rigorous procedures are needed to overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms.MethodsWe developed a Permutation-Based Non-Parametric Analysis (PBNPA) algorithm, which computes p-values at the gene level by permuting sgRNA labels, and thus it avoids restrictive distributional assumptions. Although PBNPA is designed to analyze CRISPR data, it can also be applied to analyze genetic screens implemented with siRNAs or shRNAs and drug screens.ResultsWe compared the performance of PBNPA with competing methods on simulated data as well as on real data. PBNPA outperformed recent methods designed for CRISPR screen analysis, as well as methods used for analyzing other functional genomics screens, in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves and False Discovery Rate (FDR) control for simulated data under various settings. Remarkably, the PBNPA algorithm showed better consistency and FDR control on published real data as well.ConclusionsPBNPA yields more consistent and reliable results than its competitors, especially when the data quality is low.R package of PBNPA is available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBNPA/.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gaoxiang Jia"", ids = ""5780209""); list(name = ""Xinlei Wang"", ids = ""3670929""); list(name = ""Guanghua Xiao"", ids = ""2082467"")",bbcd2e617588bb244dea275c029eff6184ef20e0; c5896ecdb7c9efad4a1f82a005153726e86550e6; 7a5b38a2af0da06a9c876673383aaff578105574; df47e825003757fb4a09fe3632a80249d11bb8a0; 240354c4707708713d16714c52f02600bf022ac9; 49fc18d36c6619d28620dd2a62008d7aada104ee,df2ad5d82b08d9b1d9642f7730e0a79453fab7f7; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 01e95b0e34b20edd432f6f6d0395aa3b4b29a509; b190b863af3d1b8d88273ed2924beff5e230e4f6; 3fcd6a0ae6a73c4e196dc13a994d7f12514fc53d; 5205fa82299cd566cf7c2966848a006ae3ad052d; 20bd926b02f13b412b546f8d47fd39661875ceb2; f9a710c3a5c31c70d4704c2df83f5912f6de91b3; e41ed842b3a33556fbc9949508ae528b47d1193a; 031ed99d27dff1163a797f345ec60206805000f7; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; 2c038d49cbd1a09fc5dcd47bc89d94d3b496d3a7; 9f9797e339c7cde8fbec533c2f068f415134e4e0; 7342aa0c0167b340c52562d56a96aa23d553b96a; 81c42bdf29edd0035b237375e2270f5a31762147; 9e2363403a9e067fca8ddb5d269ed9fcb8cb3371; d50923e86cd67ee3c9a50775023cb68dc1257b8a; 0fe9739dfde3813d3d6d99530740adadae3eb8fc; 661d49dddb7470111192c80d7e4ba1a2594c3266; 549abab55530215f47cb19e43a2c44d54e12c39e; 761e4fd55aa4333f29bc482823519f4eb950a5bf; bf339165365480d48b24ad294d740b791469d7e8; 587c3f6e3866e2c3e59da729fae5b48a6d82b94c; 703fd40cf1fe71857970b3fc7e09b9032a6ac3a4; 57fa31aa22aad401372d416dd7573c279ca20f48; 344497aa362b0f64cf3845ad2ca39abb3d99fd66; 9afc6e35a714d8eb4812ba93f6ece4655a8ef16a; 220ee8bb342033f06f768279ec54347492332c49; 62f8a69c7e3809949dd023852e0e0a54c49eaf74; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d329adf6a5d0759b2c2cf24d72982cebe5fbd7e0; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 7c4646abf89af24c251e68c28b99077931ae2c1f; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; fc9a5e00bb6e49f237846c59e605e09a7cc1a0a8; 1a68f1ff40cd100fd9e0b20692152fbe16bdb862; ade6d1a34ce18c333f531bf430118c5963a2f260,BMC Genomics,18,
74bdb17409a2f74c307f96646a0f21fc2fa047da,Development of a Computational Tool for Automatic Interpretation of Intact O-Glycopeptide Tandem Mass Spectra from Single Proteins.,"Precise and automatic analysis of site-specific O-glycosylation on single proteins is crucial for comprehensive characterization of some important glycoproteins, such as tumor biomarkers and recombinant drug proteins. Mass spectrometry has been proven to be a powerful technique for protein sequencing and N-glycosylation analysis. However, challenges remain in developing computational tools for intact O-glycopeptide analysis, which has greatly hindered the development of mass spectrometry-based O-glycosylation analysis. Herein, an integrated strategy together with a dedicated automatic computational tool termed AOGP was developed for intact O-glycopeptide analysis on single proteins. AOGP utilized de novo sequencing for O-glycans and database search strategy for peptide backbones. The false discovery rate (FDR) of the identification results was controlled and validated by a mixed gaussian distribution estimation method. AOGP exhibited superior performance on identifying intact O-glycopeptides of the human erythropoietin with a total of 188 O-glycopeptide spectra reported under 1% FDR. AOGP is developed in Python, fully open-sourced and equipped with a user-friendly interface. Such easy-operating and robust tool would greatly facilitate O-glycosylation analysis on single proteins in tumor biomarker and recombinant drug protein development.",2020,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiangming Huang"", ids = ""1861407""); list(name = ""Biyun Jiang"", ids = ""48709604""); list(name = ""Huanhuan Zhao"", ids = ""7574516""); list(name = ""Mengxi Wu"", ids = ""1409854934""); list(name = ""Siyuan Kong"", ids = ""37132013""); list(name = ""Mingqi Liu"", ids = ""88843286""); list(name = ""Peng-Yuan Yang"", ids = ""152684928""); list(name = ""Weiqian Cao"", ids = ""33848299"")",,,Analytical chemistry,,
299db95c9a47a58f32f3ac7dad1bcad6e674da95,Expression of Sestrin Genes in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer and Its Association With Fatigue: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Genetic factors that influence inflammation and energy production/expenditure in cells may affect patient outcomes following treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Sestrins, stress-inducible genes with antioxidant properties, have recently been implicated in several behaviors including fatigue. This proof-of-concept study explored whether the sestrin family of genes (SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3) were differentially expressed from baseline to the midpoint of EBRT in a sample of 26 Puerto Rican men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. We also examined whether changes in expression of these genes were associated with changes in fatigue scores during EBRT. Method: Participants completed the 13-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapyâ€”Fatigue subscale, Spanish version. Whole blood samples were collected at baseline and at the midpoint of EBRT. Gene expression data were analyzed using the limma package in the R (version R 2.14.0.) statistical software. Linear models and empirical Bayes moderation, adjusted for radiation fraction (total number of days of prescribed radiation treatment), were used to examine potential associations between changes in gene expression and change in fatigue scores. Results: Expression of SESN3 (adjusted p < .01, log fold change âˆ’0.649) was significantly downregulated during EBRT, whereas the expressions of SESN1 and SESN2 remained unchanged. After adjustment for radiation fraction, change in SESN3 expression was associated with change in fatigue during EBRT (false discovery rate <.01). Conclusions: Downregulation of SESN3, a novel pharmacoactive stress response gene, was associated with fatigue intensification during EBRT. SESN3 may serve as an interventional target and a biomarker for the cellular and molecular events associated with EBRT-related fatigue.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Velda J.

76fbde8ac52778154ce76188efb6f6482a6b9fbe,Secondary analysis of publicly available data reveals superoxide and oxygen radical pathways are enriched for associations between type 2 diabetes and low-frequency variants.,"Genome-wide association studies explain at most 5%-10% of the heritable components of type 2 diabetes. Some of the ""missing type 2 diabetes heritability"" could be explained by low-frequency variants. We examined the associations between low-frequency variants and type 2 diabetes, using data from 2538 diabetic and 2977 nondiabetic subjects in the publicly available database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. We applied two approaches. First, we combined information from all low-frequency (1%-5%) variants at a locus in a gene-centric analysis of associations with diabetes. Next, we searched for gene ontology (GO) biological processes that were enriched for gene-centric associations, after correcting for multiple testing to control the false discovery rate (FDR). We found three GO biological processes that were significantly enriched for associations to diabetes: ""response to superoxide"" (FDR-adjusted p=2.7Ã—10(-3)), ""response to oxygen radical"" (FDR-adjusted p=2.7Ã—10(-3)), and ""heart contraction"" (FDR-adjusted p=2.6Ã—10(-2)). There were three genes that contributed to ""response to superoxide"" and ""oxygen radical"" pathways, including the SOD1 gene. Gene-centric tests of association with low-frequency variants, followed by analysis to evaluate which biological pathways are enriched for these associations has the potential to recover, at least some proportion of, the ""missing heritability"" of type 2 diabetes.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mojgan Yazdanpanah"", ids = ""2098543""); list(name = ""Chuhua Chen"", ids = ""1415417876""); list(name = ""Jinko Graham"", ids = ""40433909"")",21876e877f737d716e423c6867cfebacb11d86a2; 2637fc7ad31f56e6284c8b8ffeb4ebdb2e2b4484,000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; c61bf7414278ad46459990f68100375ae4639bdb; ac2058bb6f45353154212e9361bfefc6db47ec43; 3a51e90c85fdc68c8818197c81595a545df5cdc6; 2ca6ebeb44e7d6100129473c69f8f352a8937493; d2b5ee76e2bb62e5c0f7b3732e0fa36f6248956f; 9288d828fa29f9be5dd86f1b1705fab3c7abd473; c2ed51b7bea32f23d0095b93aba5c1f5d762ea8a; b7bba158ec000d5d3c4a28a04b3666137fb555bd; 651c38be10486ad7c14aa3e5d61b7414e71a0075; 4f620d117a7f8aaafbe5270662abaf2ff75c800f; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 9c3db64d15d0874f05f0ae0651b0ed6dc25b97ab; ba4a84acd17eb394e86751f27ca0cf22cf9f5aae; 44d934d1b52b1e6d0cb2f6725157078a631b3efb; c5818fc6face971d025ca1fbd67e09f4584fcdf5; 8dad831936474c5d0f534c3449c7af884e9abe8a; 2686c030d2ff16f10f16ec1bfdbb4079fbbb12f5; e7ad511710eb2926035c4a8371835a2bea83c995; 1beab3d0f0fd013b13202fde73c26d7ed87a9c09; d1046634343a84e72156f94c610b220f9956cb71; 331fe7b3a370e4b29a488a1ecfdebf8a643e1538; 3772d06c12a57584eddb3eb55ce8b0cfbc05a1d0; 9e7fdbfd5b759f5585c0a2a7f9b8c361f29bc326; ee78c9aaaac2e265384141e6478873672088e5d6; 04d6eeba598a1fa31980ca379cbd790c0e487a5a; 618f204dfae52199fd79a47c6cb9c59b553e4cf8; 5a57173163e8b957d7c8a4b35df202d989b424e3; 940534d79f1fdc8cd6d9e0e3d75bb41f50fe1e05; b684e1eb25a8696d17d36c12f8d904fab53dcbac; e2f393d815d826b22ae36c7b606caf875ffecc9e; 7aae9ef0d2951478a06c888fa8870c6dfa5ad98f,Annals of human genetics,77 6,"

c3370975f8ffefc4168226504ca47414a1edcdb6,Using the entrapment sequence method as a standard to evaluate key steps of proteomics data analysis process,"BackgroundThe mass spectrometry based technical pipeline has provided a high-throughput, high-sensitivity and high-resolution platform for post-genomic biology. Varied models and algorithms are implemented by different tools to improve proteomics data analysis. The target-decoy searching strategy has become the most popular strategy to control false identification in peptide and protein identifications. While this strategy can estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a dataset, it cannot directly evaluate the false positive matches in target identifications.ResultsAs a supplement to target-decoy strategy, the entrapment sequence method was introduced to assess the key steps of mass spectrometry data analysis process, database search engines and quality control methods. Using the entrapment sequences as the standard, we evaluated five database search engines for both the origanal scores and reprocessed scores, as well as four quality control methods in term of quantity and quality aspects. Our results showed that the latest developed search engine MS-GF+ and percolator-embeded quality control method PepDistiller performed best in all tools respectively. Combined with efficient quality control methods, the search engines can improve the low sensitivity of their original scores. Moreover, based on the entrapment sequence method, we proved that filtering the identifications separately could increase the number of identified peptides while improving the confidence level.ConclusionIn this study, we have proved that the entrapment sequence method could be an useful strategy to assess the key steps of the mass spectrometry data analysis process.

However, using standard methods of MS not all peptides present in a sample may be identified. To combat this, a procedure termed alignment, or match-between-runs, is used to propagate identifications from one run to another toincrease the depth of quantification. There are some methods that have made significant progress in this area, but a common reliance on the matching of single pairs of runs (pair-wise matching) and the lack of control for False Discovery Rate (FDR) renders these methods less effective on experiments with a large sample number. In an attempt to build on these solutions, here we present an optimized approach to alignment, whichavoids a pair-wise matching and leverages machine learning methods to control for FDR at a feature by feature basis. Using an iterative approach, we align runs to consensus identification clusters, while using shared peptide groups between runs to automate parameter optimization and correct for retention time (RT) and mass to charge (mz) deviations. Machine learning methods are employed to rank peptide feature matches for quantification and to control for FDR during the alignment procedure. This solution has shown to scale efficiently for large sample sizes without compromising accuracy, providing around a 5% increase in precision (88.7%) and identifying 91% of known differentially expressed peptides from evaluation spike-in data sets.

593fb1d827d68b1ff410fbb38d05a3d9920224ba,Correlation between miRNA and gene expression profiles and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer.,"548 Background: Gene expression profiling may predict for pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy (NT). Identification of both miRNA and gene expression may yield novel targets and improved NT.


METHODS
Patients (pts) with HER2- locally advanced/inflammatory breast cancer (BC) were randomized to receive docetaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (TAC, arm A), or A and C given every 2 weeks Ã— 4, followed by carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (arm B). Pts with HER2+ BC received NT similar to arm B, with trastuzumab (arm C). Core biopsies were snap-frozen prior to NT, and RNA was extracted for gene array analysis (MammaPrint, BluePrint: basal, luminal, and HER2 profiling, and Agilent 44K microarray), and for deep sequence miRNA analysis with the Solexa/Illumina platform. Pathological assessment included grade, ER, HER2 expression, and evidence of residual BC vs.pCR. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis and Fisher's exact tests were utilized to assess for correlation between miRNA and gene expression, and pathologic assessment. Significant analysis of microarrays (SAM) was used to identify miRNAs differentially expressed and predictive for response (pCR vs. other) to NT.


RESULTS
miRNA expression was measured in 72 of 119 enrolled pts; 487 of the 882 miRNAs sequenced, were expressed with raw counts of > 10 in at least 3 pts. miRNA expression patterns revealed three distinct pt clusters, which were significantly associated with the 3 BluePrint subtypes and ER status (Fisher's exact test, P-values < 1e-5), and moderately associated with HER2 status and MammaPrint classes at borderline significance (P-value: 0.08 and 0.05). SAM identified 6 up and 9 down-regulated miRNAs associated with pCR in HER2- patients (N=43, 4 pCRs) with â‰¥2 fold changes at false discovery rate (FDR) < 10%. No significant signals of miRNA expression associated with pCR were found in HER2+ pts (N=28; 13 pCRs) at the same FDR level.


CONCLUSIONS
Combined assessment of miRNA and gene expression patterns is feasible, and pending validation, may yield information leading to individualized and improved NT.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""George Somlo"", ids = ""3224302""); list(name = ""Sierra Min Li"", ids = ""4671734""); list(name = ""Xiwei Wu"", ids = ""3027602""); list(name = ""S.

e8d449802a1775a8c9d3234bb8dcbd800c756ce2,The genetic architecture of economic and political preferences.,"Preferences are fundamental building blocks in all models of economic and political behavior. We study a new sample of comprehensively genotyped subjects with data on economic and political preferences and educational attainment. We use dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to estimate the proportion of variation in these traits explained by common SNPs and to conduct genome-wide association study (GWAS) and prediction analyses. The pattern of results is consistent with findings for other complex traits. First, the estimated fraction of phenotypic variation that could, in principle, be explained by dense SNP arrays is around one-half of the narrow heritability estimated using twin and family samples. The molecular-genetic-based heritability estimates, therefore, partially corroborate evidence of significant heritability from behavior genetic studies. Second, our analyses suggest that these traits have a polygenic architecture, with the heritable variation explained by many genes with small effects. Our results suggest that most published genetic association studies with economic and political traits are dramatically underpowered, which implies a high false discovery rate. These results convey a cautionary message for whether, how, and how soon molecular genetic data can contribute to, and potentially transform, research in social science. We propose some constructive responses to the inferential challenges posed by the small explanatory power of individual SNPs.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel J.

8a7f34dc9baed646f6981ee7ca9e0ef1525b353b,No genetic footprints of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene in human plasma 1H CPMG NMR metabolic profiles,"In this paper it was investigated if any genotypic footprints from the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) SNP could be found in 600Â MHz 1H CPMG NMR profiles of around 1,000 human plasma samples from healthy Danish twins. The problem was addressed with a combination of univariate and multivariate methods. The NMR data was substantially compressed using principal component analysis or multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares with focus on chemically meaningful feature selection reflecting the nature of chemical signals in an NMR spectrum. The possible existence of an FTO signature in the plasma samples was investigated at the subject level using supervised multivariate classification in the form of extended canonical variate analysis, classification tree modeling and Lasso (L1) regularized linear logistic regression model (GLMNET). Univariate hypothesis testing of peak intensities was used to explore the genotypic effect on the plasma at the population level. The multivariate classification approaches indicated poor discriminative power of the metabolic profiles whereas univariate hypothesis testing provided seven spectral regions with pÂ <Â 0.05. Applying false discovery rate control, no reliable markers could be identified, which was confirmed by test set validation. We conclude that it is very unlikely that an FTO-correlated signal can be identified in these 1H CPMG NMR plasma metabolic profiles and speculate that high-throughput un-targeted genotype-metabolic correlations will in many cases be a difficult path to follow.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Karin Kjeldahl"", ids = ""49320883""); list(name = ""Morten Rasmussen"", ids = ""144746993""); list(name = ""Ann Louise Hasselbalch"", ids = ""6700223""); list(name = ""Ko O.

a8003316789129d6a04565a73ad447053fecf8dc,Abstract 2072: Genomic studies of Brazilian patients with hepatoblastoma: Insight into somatic mutations using whole-exome sequencing,"Hepatoblastomas (HB) are embryonal tumors of the liver with histological features that resemble different stages of liver differentiation. The identification of molecular pathways involved in HB development can expand the understanding of the connections between disruption of normal differentiation and cancer. Exome sequencing (244K Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment) analysis was performed for 6 HBs matched with their non tumoral liver tissues (fresh frozen tissues). Bioinformatic analysis of exome data identified somatic variants in 69 genes which were chosen for validation using a target sequencing panel (SureSelectXT Target Enrichment System for Illumina Paired-End Sequencing Library). The gene panel was composed of the detected 69 genes and other 48 genes related with HB or cancer, and it was used to investigated additional 13 HB samples as a validation group. 60% of the patients were male, and the mean age at diagnosis was 36 months. 13% of this cohort presented pulmonary metastasis. All patients received pre-surgery chemotherapy (SIOPEL and COG protocol). Results: A total of 71 somatic rare coding mutations (missense and loss-of-function) were validated in 53 genes considering the entire HB group. The somatic analysis reveals pathogenic mutations in the CTNNB1 gene and a recurrent missense mutation in the CX3CL1 gene; the role of these mutations was explored by IHQ studies of their proteins as well as by gene expression analysis by RT-PCR. We also used results from Illumina 450k to evaluated the methylation levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 genes. Methylation values for CpG sites in each sample were measured as Î²-and CpG sites were grouped into categories, promoter (1stExon; 59UTR; TSS1500; TSS200) or gene body, information provided by Illumina, based on UCSC data (GRhC 37). The methylation level of each category was obtained by averaging the Î²-values of all CpGs mapped in the category for each gene, followed by Wilcoxon test correction by calculating the false discovery rate (FDR). Conclusion: Most investigated HBs carry few potentially pathogenic genetic mutations (â‰¤ 5 mutations). This observed low frequency of somatic mutations is a result similar to previous studies. The proposed explanation is based on the fact that pediatric tumors would originate from precursor cells with pluripotent characteristics; therefore, such tumors may require fewer mutations than adult solid tumors to develop. The congenital HB case of our cohort is discrepant from this scenario since a relatively high number of somatic mutations were found compared to the HB group. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive genomic characterization of Brazilian HBs. Next steps include expanding the casuistry of exome sequenced tumors, including two cases of HB associated with Hirschprung disease.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of lung malignancy.


METHODS
To identify and validate potential DNA methylation markers for risk assessment and disease detection, we examined peripheral blood leukocyte DNA specimens for methylation differences between SCLC cases and controls. We tested 1505 CpG sites using the Illumina Beadchip assay and validated 9 CpG sites using pyrosequencing technology.


RESULTS
In 44 matched SCLC case-control pairs, we identified significant differences at 62 CpG sites (false discovery rate < or =0.05) in 52 independent genes. Of those, we further determined 43 sites in 36 genes with a mean methylation level difference greater than 0.03 between the cases and controls. We then selected and validated 9 CpG sites for methylation differences in an independent set of 138 matched case-control pairs. The 9 validated CpG sites predicted a higher risk for cases than controls in 85.8% of all pairs of cases and controls, and 2 (in genes CSF3R and ERCC1) jointly contributed most of the discriminating ability.


CONCLUSIONS
Our replicated results demonstrated feasibility of applying large-scale methylation arrays for biomarker discovery and subsequent validation in peripheral blood DNA.

a90e385150ed83bc9c58bfd5967a376ee306edce,Circulating levels of immune and inflammatory markers and long versus short survival in early-stage lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Some patients diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer and treated according to standard care survive for only a short period of time, while others survive for years for reasons that are not well understood. Associations between markers of inflammation and survival from lung cancer have been observed.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Here, we investigate whether circulating levels of 77 inflammatory markers are associated with long versus short survival in stage I and II lung cancer. Patients who had survived either <79 weeks (~1.5 years) (short survivors, SS) or >156 weeks (3 years) (long survivors, LS) were selected from a retrospective population-based study. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The false discovery rate was calculated to adjust for multiple testing.


RESULTS
A total of 157 LS and 84 SS were included in this analysis. Thirteen markers had adjusted OR on the order of 2- to 5-fold when comparing the upper and lower quartiles with regard to the odds of short survival versus long. Chemokine CCL15 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 15] was the most significant marker associated with increased odds of short survival (ORs = 4.93; 95% CI 1.90-12.8; q-value: 0.042). Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were not associated with marker levels.


CONCLUSIONS

20d1bd9fa92fb9aced70319ac96e7bfd30abe88d,Paternal body mass index and offspring DNA methylation: findings from the PACE consortium,"Background: Accumulating evidence links paternal adiposity in the peri-conceptional period to offspring health outcomes. DNA methylation has been proposed as a mediating mechanism, but very few studies have explored this possibility in humans.
Methods and findings: In the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium, we conducted a meta-analysis of co-ordinated epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of paternal prenatal Body Mass Index (BMI) (with and without adjustment for maternal BMI) in relation to DNA methylation in offspring blood at birth (13 datasets; total n= 4,894) and in childhood (six datasets; total n = 1,982). We found little evidence of association at either time point: for all CpGs, the False Discovery Rate-adjusted P-values were >0.05. In sex-stratified analyses, we found just four CpGs where there was robust evidence of association in female offspring. To compare our findings to those of other studies, we conducted a systematic review, which identified seven studies, including five candidate gene studies showing associations between paternal BMI/obesity and offspring or sperm DNA methylation at imprinted regions. However, in our own study, we found very little evidence of enrichment for imprinted genes.
Conclusion: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that paternal BMI around the time of pregnancy is associated with offspring blood DNA methylation, even at imprinted regions.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Gemma C Sharp"", ids = ""47157267""); list(name = ""Rossella Alfano"", ids = ""50134797""); list(name = ""Deborah A.

2ef1bddda95702050e913cfc2ff9ac883623318e,Fecal Microbiota Differences According to the Risk of Advanced Colorectal Neoplasms,"Goals and Background: This study aimed to compare differences in the fecal microbiota according to the risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) based on a risk-score model in a large Korean cohort. Study: Stool samples were collected from 1122 health screening recipients: 404 enrolled in the average risk (AR) group, 514 in the moderate risk (MR) group, and 204 in the high risk (HR) group, in accordance with their risk of ACN. The fecal microbiota was characterized using pyrosequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes. Results: The overall microbial diversity was significantly reduced with an increased risk of ACN [false discovery rate (FDR), P<0.001], and the composition was significantly different between the risk groups (Bonferroni corrected, P<0.05). On taxonomic comparison, 6 of 11 phyla and 39 of 88 genera were significantly different among the risk groups (all FDR P<0.05). These included under-representation of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Bifidobacterium, and over-representation of Prevotella and Fusobacterium with an increased risk of ACN. In particular, we observed that the unknown genus of Ruminococcaceae were relatively abundant (16.2%) in the AR group and significantly depleted with an increased risk of ACN (13.5% in the HR group; FDR P<0.001). Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that the fecal microbiota is different according to the risk of ACN.

64bb19cbba2090ea1fba5447591d9efe95be65b6,Additional common loci associated with stroke and obesity identified using pleiotropic analytical approach,"Stroke is a complex disease with multiple etiologies. Numerous studies suggest an established association between obesity and stroke, which may partly arise from the shared genetic components between the two phenotypes. Despite genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some loci associated with stroke and obesity individually, the estimated genetic variability explained by these loci is limited (especially for stroke) and the pleiotropic loci between them are largely unknown. In this study, we jointly applied the pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method and the genetic analysis incorporating pleiotropy and annotation (GPA) method on summary statistics of two large GWASs to detect the genetic overlap between stroke (nâ€‰=â€‰446,696) and obesity (nâ€‰=â€‰681,275). Stratified Qâ€“Q and fold-enrichment plots showed strong pleiotropic enrichment between the two phenotypes. With cFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and fdr.GPAâ€‰<â€‰0.2, we identified 24 (16 novel) stroke-associated SNPs and 12 (10 novel) of them to be potentially pleiotropic SNPs for both phenotypes. The corresponding genes were enriched in trait-associated gene ontology (GO) terms â€œbrain developmentâ€ and â€œnegative regulation of transportâ€. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the feasibility and effectivity of the two pleiotropic methods which successfully improved the genetic discovery by incorporating related GWAS datasets and validated the genetic intercommunity between stroke and obesity. The identification of pleiotropic loci may provide us any new insights into potential genetic and etiology mechanism between them for the further studies.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lian-ke Wang"", ids = ""15068897""); list(name = ""Fei Xu"", ids = ""145162309""); list(name = ""Anna Brickell"", ids = ""1435350285""); list(name = ""Nan Sun"", ids = ""48000411""); list(name = ""Xiangjie Mao"", ids = ""151257894""); list(name = ""Qiang Zhang"", ids = ""49347078""); list(name = ""Ganyi Wang"", ids = ""1933896""); list(name = ""Qianyu Zhou"", ids = ""1450269757""); list(name = ""Bin Yang"", ids = ""47677187""); list(name = ""Fangwei Li"", ids = ""49515925""); list(name = ""Limin Yue"", ids = ""48182066""); list(name = ""Weidong Zhang"", ids = ""117636057""); list(name = ""Yibin Hao"", ids = ""151261064""); list(name = ""Changqing Sun"", ids = ""152873476"")",,bf69aed8c59bc7099c6bb429d06e25b88efefd91; 15988aa5297519be42ccd9b7ac422d3b437eb0d8; b72d15a8529801e62605d8d65670376e316d81b0; 65ae34915b43cd7c0030c74a7c2def7b321bed89; 917dd30b5fbc8a26fe7922a17d1e1b1fe2d30494; 04291dfdb462b3d5a2f1e8679a64c117448080a0; 5cc02257a8d4fffc4c2730220cee35fee45174e5; d97e68517eca13f32c0401ec67c9cc93b8f008c4; a3492156342cb442f15fcf34ac565fd2301ab58f; 7deb84191e9fc80101739718dbe9da916bd9d314; 121b235f9bea3e0b357195f8d9ad0bbe4857809b; 7c33a580f3b31fa8368808f85e440bad836c5ccf; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 68ba35b2ef2568e0874cdab6511526583b844c70; ef21a054f3185424bb3c5a3f6fcda363b2fd011f; 11a3ac464b7cc5afe48172efe12ce4346dbf452d; 23792a5f1319da9183c1cf7f8421184bb99be53a; a125584b8d7d7a5be27e3f0e32a79dcec8afe08d; ab81fba9600ddeff1a20edd78a29f2e53dd7deaa; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; 9960e81a6a5d89ac3afa8f150f4116cba93b3a8c; 8e95231c5cfdd1699b98445d0f56e887eed8b5bb; 1c091d845922b79140eb8e45336c3dce930304ba; 89253c99f8a5984597bd8d5cad308342b7eb0d04; 2cc74ad8bd042a3d15e1c87839bcf7658d88a675; 0dce38ef9afedf776707978827092959086f568a; 55c51bcb8c0c26985386018ef6210539404ac6d3; f3f281103d71733eb052eb9cf1a00f05a3f228f0; 8ce272a2f0999fc3b793e2c15cd32fa6ee54188a; 1ace39f8584ac122f4c6b7695ce9e0d3218be430; 6e8d1cafdb75b8d8a1105f3ab342e225092add4e; 721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef; dfb897857a2c2dac8f656ea44362287274ed33a1; f1c8ac613b59abd978bbffcf6ecf5b6b4dd1b86f; 9678aac3a830160592216797caff93f18432b6bd; 12538da11926df7c6d71a74673be0a70794fdf9e; 7299053685a1db4e5d683527a45343f65d0854fd; 431acc284809d1b378452e0e1d9038b49627ea7c; 414934c4caf34c8e32d67f6fe53498249e4b28dd; 2b5216a4c490285b00fbdeef18aaedf17e8fc72c; 361c5dcd41aee7110e253f884a767df43651ce71; 4115c0a5b71efe239448a20b97eeca6a492f4eec; 9c739e31bb835a9f06c2306a869332cacb71138b; a1b255a3c49bb97f1360c77f0bf976b23b1d255c; 357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55; 32b252e8e39065aec7e91022439ed0badd34e813; a5dd8686ccb739f70e89a34a5aebaa342bf10b57; 03b818bbeb0528a0dc9552f1b5bd5b1e4272abd7; bbac4509f538eaec6fe426c09d818271d0817f54; cee5c856959edc3b97c645397bc9c00f649f439d; ab4d13bd1dd062427cc7a78f158fba60dd2b6daf,Molecular Genetics and Genomics,295,439 - 451
c6e8de6bd0ae91b2b03dad6dcb1cd908045f00f2,Gene modules and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer subtypes: a pooled analysis.,"PURPOSE
To investigate the association between chemotherapy response and gene expression modules describing important biologic processes and druggable oncogenic pathways in breast cancer (BC) subtypes.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We searched for publicly available gene expression studies evaluating anthracycline with or without taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and identified eight studies with 996 patients. We computed 17 gene modules and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for pathologic complete response (pCR) for one-unit increases in scaled modules with and without adjustment for clinicopathologic characteristics. Added predictive accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and integrated discrimination index (IDI). We used the false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple testing.


RESULTS
High immune module scores were associated with increased pCR probability in all BC subtypes. High module scores of chromosomal instability, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss, and E2F3 transcription factor were associated with increased pCR probability in estrogen receptor (ER) -negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative and ER-positive/HER2-negative but not in HER2-positive tumors (interactions between HER2 and each of these modules for their association with pCR: P < .05; FDR, 0.17; trend for interaction between HER2 and PTEN). High values of insulin-like growth factor 1 activation module were associated with increased pCR probability only in ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors (interaction between insulin-like growth factor 1 and ER: P = .002; FDR, 0.03). When adding the immune module to clinicopathologic characteristics, we observed substantial increases in predictive accuracy for pCR in the HER2-positive subtype (IDI, 0.093; P = .004; increase in AUC from 0.760 to 0.836).

11eb0d6babfa7addd657cbd1cd2ba7e662e2e169,Endometrial stromal cell proteome mapping in repeated implantation failure and recurrent pregnancy loss cases and fertile women.,"RESEARCH QUESTION
Are there proteomic differences between endometrial stromal cells of repeated implantation failure (RIF), recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and normal fertile women, and is there differential protein expression upon decidualization?


DESIGN
This exploratory study investigated the proteome of in-vitro cultured endometrial stromal cells of women with RIF (nâ€¯=â€¯4), women with RPL (nâ€¯=â€¯3) and normal fertile women (nâ€¯=â€¯4), comparing day 0 with 5 days of decidualization. Total proteins extracted from cell lysates were analysed by high-definition mass spectrometry. Data analysis was performed using significance analysis of microarray in R (PÂ <Â 0.05; false discovery rate [FDR] 10%).


RESULTS
In the RIF group, ANXA6, PSMC5 and FSCN1 were up-regulated (1.9-fold, 2.5-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively), whereas PBXIP1 was down-regulated (7.7-fold) upon decidualization. In the RPL group, RPS25 and ACADVL were down-regulated (1.9-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively; FDR 10%) between the non-decidualized and the decidualized samples. In the normal fertile group VIM and RPL23A were down-regulated (1.9-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively). Comparing ratios of expression of decidualized over non-decidualized samples in the different groups revealed six differentially expressed proteins: DUX4L2, CNPY4, PDE7A, CTSK, PCBP2 and PSMD4. Comparison of RPL versus normal fertile in the decidualized condition revealed serotransferrin to be differentially expressed. The changes in expression levels for serotransferrin, ANX6, ACDVL and VIM were confirmed by western blot.


CONCLUSIONS
Results show a varying response of endometrial stromal cells in distinct clinical groups (RIF, RPL and normal fertile) upon in-vitro decidualization. Serotransferrin could serve as a marker for the aberrant decidualization process in RPL.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lien Dhaenens"", ids = ""47473773""); list(name = ""Sylvie Lierman"", ids = ""9948800""); list(name = ""Laura De Clerck"", ids = ""50317965""); list(name = ""Elisabeth Govaert"", ids = ""1868861""); list(name = ""Dieter Deforce"", ids = ""2886347""); list(name = ""Kelly Tilleman"", ids = ""4004773""); list(name = ""Petra De Sutter"", ids = ""87522276"")",,,Reproductive biomedicine online,38 3,"

(Contributions Ã  l'analyse statistique des donnÃ©es de puces Ã  ADN),"This thesis deals with statistical questions raised by the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data for cancer research. In the first part, we study asymptotic properties of multiple testing procedures that aim at controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR), that is, the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP) among rejected hypotheses. We develop a versatile formalism to calculate the asymptotic distribution of the FDP an the associated regularity conditions, for a wide range of multiple testing procedures, and compare their asymptotic power. We then study in terms of FDR control connections between intrinsic bounds between three multiple testing problems: detection, estimation and selection. In particular, we connect convergence rates in the estimation problem to the regularity of the p-value distribution near 1. In the second part, we develop statistical methods to study DNA microarrays for cancer research. We propose a microarray normalization method that removes spatial biases while preserving the true biological signal; it combines robust regression with a mixture model with spatial constraints. Then we develop a method to infer gene regulations from gene expression data, which is based on learning and multiple testing theories. Finally, we build a genomic score to predict, for a patient treated for a breast tumor, whether or not a second cancer is a true recurrence of the first cancer.",2008,Philosophy; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pierre Neuvial"", ids = ""2225429"")",,1f812e8552e484f91fad0c5d895c90e739185609; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 779c5bede5f8c3748fd64f2952d2b8e0c2b5e83e; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; 70bd7cdd149be7aa1d7a6554ee35ea041b4770f3; 9fd8ddd60fd63d30f126d5539e2ae66bda8a2fe3; f9e62cb9770a5bf2cee84d502a86f159de549039; aae12f9e45409a4dfd217d75083a0a59b8c0d482; b1aba0032340dada7856599fd9940345216d88b8; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 0acec919dfb7485853f190dcd77baf15a640e7ac; d6e13df3fbb2002ab5af4859853a96fd0d800127; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; d0e6810965ad6445fcec66450a3718facac00a7e; e34fcd35bfc5307d7969ff9d1576f178da62bd73; 7cecc68f7e98c2ebc4db02f9732df87bae6ebef2; 7c8ab4825e0d59ab38c0790a8ca7ee81edfe9e4b; 0d20628fcf2a86eb0af84fcecd3ec0fc238e973b; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; 83e6025f99ad97864db7a3b616778dbfef396ce8; 43ac1a4b74032c1ee05f0236b456975f2a7b05c4; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 3c1bcdfe4fc923f767c919deb39e0f9b841d5b71; 2c35fecde37468d266b75a2d7299d56f0f934650; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; dc5c799d20933dc0d997801f9db104c4c3a2022d; e67a48bc1559cb64374da33e9280f81e8354759f; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 40dc08023b998633975d83f875d0ed6aa80f7654; 1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 47cc08e8f97b29ea1cfb6e6472fb609d691a46f7; a83ab9be45d562f0bd022805c0b45ccb1f923cae; 69d6630f4dd2ad193b0a915f4881d528e3888832; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; 88a82e1655a462f10485702599454585e47682a0; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; ecbe7b41b6412d4af05739b0735f7ba034fe0b54; f69dcc4d0452eeb03f0a0361238334a9110b527f; 565e003bd3ef73fab1e079bab8d41df8581a7b08; 08d23fdaeec2a46da5189cf105de238fb37bb77e; c0775b1f5d1b7cced27dd2d9262cafad1f4bc4dd; f545c45cdebb6e60f8fbca6efbfdf6268ff390a3; 85adb8dc6e3f3e9210382c7281ac0ac91f367006; 4519d38567e37ede04f7d3851cbce770bd4aed3b; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; 2aeb1014dc66515c533369394b9d23212ffdbc0c; 8a6822c5a24df2ea9d9a336de80cc08bd2693842; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; 4be810a3da26bd0d2002095eac5976e3f7e83580; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 242635b54349a3149c7404e73c0b5cb7dd4043c9; d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; e74b906b0af21df55a51c779495cc8f0fdb2fbfa; 0ff7b1ed34a17a30544e0fef3152cdb25e3ae6fa; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 9241a5d07f570800ab43f4c9bcdedaf2fb6dc7be; 8dc757cb77ed7cf42220e38b9dbe31346e801d32; 418ca74964d4c9ceba96fe2d7183f62858bdada9; 76a799264f524fe65f4360c92959d3d758b75c87; af2b7af47ff23290f75a48ba2fd1ad1a9aca1dde; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; d60004fb5fe01f2ae4aacbb5f3839ed97d307661; 64448ce5fe9f0d01097fe0a21395c21f895cecfc; 2a0bf30dc789b2f9aa9f1078cff496afe54134e2; a03e6e5b81637b34f9a9a446f0a3158a64befe96; 66022f1542756503ebbc2378aa170263acb5f10d; 4463f383a43b63c9f4bd9bf3b332f166ec79f3ec; f07981638c44a64e6b32ed5bf4d835e962adeabd; 0cd6a57304e89656611273d9d58d918b52e9c81e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 19f35877f4b4130aa398e4295201cac8eeeb09b7; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c525534468f26d33cbba4153204ce8948d4d0f40; 87e7213a5a6a313753c78e7edb44196d5a0802c1; 72bda2b9be1e4bac9341ce5cc326c3235f9794e4; 01a1d065a5292be740e75029622a3ab5e71e3150; d15085fda97ebf0a16b42a5b476b2c9dd0fe8e62; 3d0be30f677f05a234c718f3644d6d5d143bd4db; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 92013517811f387db2d75b6f81a524813c760218; eae4f630dbcfc0768adf6f90c2c490adfe4174fd; c6c1f74cb3cfb37fb01183d92593dbc4c7d5fcab; c6f66a45e58c7fe228f16f4f822a1a042a22d8db; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; b7916b2c089b27d4f3a6bc403c0c9ad81aea55c6; 956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff; 2bfe5e241d2e5ca363c71ed8b820c4e4fbd0f86f; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093,,,
35e9e12b051d19639584e0c6ebc68266911b92e1,KSR1 is coordinately regulated with Notch signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in thyroid cancer.,"Kinase suppressor of RAS1 (KSR1) is a scaffold protein implicated in RAS-mediated RAF activation. However, the molecular function of KSR in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is unknown. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the role of KSR1 in patients with PTC. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed inter-tumor heterogeneities in the expression of KSR1 in PTC tissues. Interestingly, BRAFV600E-positive PTC showed higher KSR1 mRNA expression than BRAFV600E-negative PTC (P<0.001). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using public repositories showed that high KSR1 expression coordinately upregulated Notch signaling (nominal P=0.019, false discovery rate (FDR) q-value=0.165); this finding was supported by GeneNetwork analysis, indicating that KSR1 expression is positively correlated with NOTCH1 expression (Ï=0.677, P=6.15Ã—10(-9)). siRNA against KSR1 (siKSR1) significantly decreased ERK phosphorylation induced by BRAFV600E, resulting in reduced expression of NOTCH1 and HES1, targets of Notch signaling. GSEA revealed that high KSR1 expression was also associated with downregulation of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Consistent with this, electron microscopy showed that PTCs with high KSR1 expression exhibited structural defects of the mitochondrial cristae. Furthermore, siKSR1-transfected BCPAP and 8505C cells generated fewer colonies in colony-forming assays. In addition, GSEA showed that high expression of KSR2 and connector enhancer of KSR1 (CNKSR1) also coordinately upregulated Notch signaling (KSR2: nominal P=0.0097, FDR q-value=0.154 and CNKSR1: nominal P<0.0001, FDR q-value=0.00554), and high CNKSR2 was associated with downregulation of the OxPhos gene set (nominal P<0.0001, FDR q-value <0.0001). In conclusion, KSR1 is coordinately regulated with Notch signaling and OxPhos in PTC, because its scaffold function might be required to sustain the proliferative signaling and metabolic remodeling associated with this type of cancer.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jandee Lee"", ids = ""120704766""); list(name = ""Mi-Youn Seol"", ids = ""5952574""); list(name = ""Seonhyang Jeong"", ids = ""6415994""); list(name = ""Hyeong Ju Kwon"", ids = ""87076165""); list(name = ""Cho Rok Lee"", ids = ""4458412""); list(name = ""Cheol Ryong Ku"", ids = ""6209219""); list(name = ""Sang-Wook Kang"", ids = ""11781135""); list(name = ""Jong Ju Jeong"", ids = ""5019819""); list(name = ""Dong Yeob Shin"", ids = ""4102251""); list(name = ""Kee-Hyun Nam"", ids = ""52434215""); list(name = ""Eun Jig Lee"", ids = ""4519636""); list(name = ""Woong Youn Chung"", ids = ""2998203""); list(name = ""Young Suk Jo"", ids = ""4407509"")",4abe01010d7755de762dec2807f5ad64a7f7d486; 96591201ca6dc2b79e11abc3652598a35723c69f,8196b0321d1699937a7444993731ab46aee8c9c8; 4efbac09bf3a18ad8533a1e8802d7a92efceb429; 5ef58b9e7dec3e8e77bf11999b6ae8a7bb74e258; 37fda9a29d0b7c4f305557c28fd1350d157bb603; d7edc9bc1af3ad365b22141f2618158900d37dbb; 9641f28882ce2bf92105a27f145f2d83eed6f6c3; d0db251059054eda5585756d59123d7543ea9f20; 58595cbe9b7c26737e8222c4f886a74cc238b713; ef728b51f844f4b6adb8cfc70568fbd23076cd37; 4585500b0e09b62b2aa20c35072b18fac28cf2d1; db24384ca0c57cf08be86be3d65f8511990dad01; 23a40a247244ff0a19e64b2b1d5655029e43cc27; f7f061693eaa253f9f9f2763077bb8e1d3ed7420; 93848ac042b4b5801fbba1b97ebcfb5ef7b04970; 8a75d607955ea9eac90619e727101150bec6356e; 7c2db8fe93dfae182aaa55aa3de21f49110b6f52; b4f39e49b5d44c6f2f025be8a596b34c7e60180b; f3ef2fcc33eed3f416ae85e9c566b61009871b6d; 14896d32ba7e0418f00def47c4eb886e8d6136c4; a1152ced538280878e632020d5549c483a3c5ef0; 9e3971a542fdf657b176bfa0cc273741ce81a753; 06847f644154e2391862dd11fff779a29dd01c7c; 206aca9f166a0c287a4ac45dfcf35b957757a025; 7292fcb10a849e5625b8a41abefd86da70affa31; 7799b7212e6460d2cff64504efdb6437e1c638d9; b4d349d8b6207499e02ca7890f71c3f38ff3b1cd; 46b2270df4e84401f5ab86cc132993f1eb2d32fa; 08f7a4a69cde056687cd5f093e38edcc1c520381; 61cd584854310a0cdb2e3364a61f638aca7d1c8a; 38cc10db3a0636a1615d2855eeb352d2d5cf8b63; ab623c72a141c0202bc2bb2e7c61e27e6f66bac8; 314dc6f72a331ac9271794eea67d8ad811c70bdd; fd048a8e9eae7cb4d46c2028eea1bbdfe3952747; f5639d0afaedaaeb5154d57383d22236403c85db; 9e4c6df56eb991acc60117b4308c3f06c70c5307; 40bc2aa85b396981db657f5d7430a742e2fb7fb1; 5354a912c387d2f4f451a82f5a55a367eee4e9aa; 7923fc90521c0b570b6d6e15178115a7fa3f04d7; 603c948708c6de9480485062a396296b5206c474; d2a0f38be18d38b8d88c2a28fee07e26bfc03592; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; ce20e894eae52729161926b2aceb4193994980dc; 66ce9f3a73bc3e2edb795b17a7e10d2b803e92c6; 00e27b305031555e6e925392e2c55f96f975195d; 7c24e09d1bdcdd0d6da68d82ed9de53b6faf171d; c754901d14215384adfda00aa950b595c935ac25; a7c65fbbc6d95d39ef0619e347c8c065ccd884ed; d4fd1c69cbd331cc7a5c1e5d14424a265fdc94cb; 6afd285774ca70a91885a22c133fb975567d471f; fca52b2ebd2c0ec01ed3c4f592185b8b41c79c07; 38397b3441daf763423eb7e0352262b878df06bd,Journal of molecular endocrinology,54 2,"

Classification of hypoxia inducible factor 2Î± mutation-related paragangliomas as subcluster 1C Recently, activating mutations of hypoxia inducible factor 2Î± (HIF2A/ EPAS1) have been recognized to predispose to secondary polycythemia, multiple paragangliomas (PGLs), duodenal somatostatinomas, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, and ocular abnormalities. Previoulsy, mutations in the SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF1, VHL, FH, PHD1, and PHD2 genes have been associated with HIF-activation and the development of PGLs (i.e. cluster-1 or pseudohypoxic (phx) PGLs). In agreement with a common mechanisms of tumorigenesis, the gene expression profile of selected HIF2A-mutant PGLs have been shown to share features with phx PGLs. Nevertheless, despite overlap on the molecular level, tumor location, metastatic potential, syndromic presentation, and secretagogue production of phx PGL differ by genotype. Previously, we identified characteristic expression differences according to genotype and tumor location of phx PGLs. Here we aim to establish characteristic differences between HIF2A and non-HIF2A phx PGLs. Six HIF2A PGLs were compared to normal adrenal medulla (n=8) and other hereditary phx PGLs (von Hippel-Lindau /VHL/: n=13, succinate dehydrogenase subunit B /SDHB/: n=18 and D /SDHD/: n=14). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that HIF2A PGLs make up a separate cluster from other phx PGLs. Significance analysis of microarray yielded 875 differentially expressed genes between HIF2A and other phx PGLs after normalization to adrenal medulla (false discovery rate 0.01). Prediction analysis of microarray allowed correct classification of all HIF2A samples based on as little as 3 genes (TRHDE, LRRC63, IGSF10; error rate: 0.02). Genes with the highest expression difference between normal medulla and HIF2A PGLs were selected for confirmatory qRT-PCR. In conclusion, HIF2A-PGLs show a characteristic expression signature that separates them from non-HIF2A phx PGLs. Unexpectedly, the most significantly differentially expressed genes have not been previously described as HIF target genes. O2 â€“ Guido Di Dalmazi (MÃ¼nchen) et al. Plasma metabolomics profile in patients with Cushing's syndrome Background: Cushing Ìs syndrome (CS) is a chronic disorder characterized by endogenous cortisol excess resulting in long-term metabolic and cardiovascular consequences. The identification of metabolic alterations occurring in patients with hypercortisolism could be beneficial in tailoring treatments of co-morbidities. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based assays have recently revolutionized the analysis of targeted metabolomics in biological fluids. So far, no studies investigating metabolomics profile in CS patients have been performed with this technique. Aim: Our aim was to characterize the metabolic alterations occurring in patients with hypercortisolism by targeted plasma metabolomic profiling. Methods: Subjects (n=149) were recruited from three German centers (Munich, Berlin, and WÃ¼rzburg) belonging to the German Cushing registry (CUSTODES) and the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT). Patients were classified in four groups, according to clinical characteristics and results of dexamethasone suppression test (DST): non-secreting adrenocortical adenomas (NS, post-DST cortisol <1.8Î¼g/dL) (n=27), subclinical hypercortisolism (SCS, post-DST cortisol >1.8Î¼g/dL without clinical signs of hypercortisolism, in presence of adrenal mass) (n=34), CS (post-DST cortisol >1.8Î¼g/dL with signs of hypercortisolism) (n=46), and excluded Cushing (EC, post-DST cortisol <1.8Î¼g/dL in patients with initial clinical suspicion of hypercortisolism, without adrenal tumor) (n=42). Plasma targeted metabolomics profiling was performed using AbsoluteIDQ-p180 kit (BIOCRATES AG, Austria). Internal standards served as reference for calculation of metabolite concentrations. Results: Metabolic profile of CS was characterized by reduced carnitine levels (P=0.003) and increased activity of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I (P<0.001), with respect to EC and SCS. Polyamine levels (putrescine [P=0.018], spermidine [P<0.001], spermine [P<0.001]), and serotonin (P=0.013) were increased in CS patients, whereas tryptophan and kynurenine levels were decreased (P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively) when compared to EC. Spermidine was progressively increased among NS, SCS, and CS patients, and showed positive correlation with post-DST cortisol (Coefficient=0.341, P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis, including age as a covariate, showed that the panel of significant metabolites among groups was able to correctly classify 84.6% of subjects (88.1% EC, 77.8% NS, 82.4% SCS, 87.0% CS). Using logistic regression and ROC curves we established two discriminating scores with sensitivity >95% and specificity >85% (area under the curve 0.971 and 0.978, respectively, P<0.001). Conclusion: Metabolomic profile by LC-MS/MS revealed several metabolic disturbances in patients with hypercortisolism, mainly involving polyamine and tryptophan metabolism, and beta-oxidation. Metabolomic analysis showed also good accuracy in classifying patients with hypercortisolism according to their specific metabolic phenotype. O3 â€“ Mirko Peitzsch (Dresden) et al. Paediatric reference intervals of plasma free normetanephrine, metanephrine and 3methoxytyramine: Application for diagnosis of neuroblastoma Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour of childhood representing 8.5% of all malignancies in paediatric patients. These neoplasms derive from neural crest progenitors and like phaeochromocytomas produce catecholamines. The tumours, however, have a limited capacity for catecholamine storage and secretion so that the catecholamines produced are largely metabolized within tumour cells. Catecholamine metabolites, not the parent amines, therefore provide the mainstay for diagnosis, but continue to rely on measurements in spot urine samples of homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), tests first implemented 50 years ago, with limited diagnostic sensitivity. Measurements of free metanephrines, the O-methylated metabolites of catecholamines, are well established to provide superior sensitivity for diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma than the parent amines or downstream metabolites such as VMA. Improved understanding of catecholamine metabolism, specifically recognition of production of metanephrines within chromaffin cells and their tumour cell derivatives provides the basis for recognizing the diagnostic advantages of metanephrines, which we hypothesize, might also apply to neuroblastoma. Methods: Plasma concentrations of normetanephrine, metanephrine and methoxytyramine were measured in two patient cohorts: 1. a patient cohort, without evidence of a catecholamineproducing neoplasm, including 228 girls and 212 boys, aged between 2 days and 18 years; and 2. additional 25 paediatric patients with confirmed diagnosis of neuroblastoma. Results: Among the reference group cohort, concentrations of plasma free normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine were high in neonates up until six months of age, but thereafter decreased within the next several months to levels comparable to those of adults. In contrast, concentrations of plasma free metanephrine showed a reciprocal pattern with low concentrations in neonates, thereafter increasing during the first year to levels comparable to those of adults. Using this reference population to establish upper cut-offs, all children with neuroblastoma had increases in either or both methoxytyramine (96%) and normetanephrine (84%), indicating a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%. For the routinely used combination of VMA and HVA, diagnostic sensitivity was 94.4% (94.4% for HVA and 66.6% for VMA). Conclusions: The dynamic reciprocal changes in plasma concentrations of normetanephrine and methoxytyramine compared to metanephrine during early childhood suggest underlying developmental changes in extra-adrenal and adrenal chromaffin tissue that must be considered in establishing paediatric reference intervals in catecholamine metabolites. With such reference intervals now at hand, the present results also indicate that measurements of plasma normetanephrine and methoxytyramine provide a potentially useful diagnostic test for identification of patients with neuroblastomas.

Genetic landscape of sporadic unilateral adrenocortical adenomas without PRKACA p.Leu206Arg mutation Genetic alterations affecting the PKA/cAMP pathway are commonly found in cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas (ACAs), while activating mutations in the gene coding for betacatenin (CTNNB1) are reported in both adenomas and carcinomas. However, the molecular pathogenesis of most ACAs is still unclear. Aim of the study was a comprehensive genetic characterization of sporadic ACAs. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA of ACAs and corresponding blood samples of 99 patients (39 with overt Cushing Ìs syndrome, 35 with subclinical hypercortisolism and 25 endocrine inactive) negative for the p.Leu206Arg PRKACA mutation. In total, 706 protein-altering somatic mutations were detected in 88/99 ACAs (median: 6 mutations per sample, range: 0-55). Several altered genes could be recognized as part of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway (CTNNB1, APC, APC2, PKP2, and different members of the protocadherin superfamily), being associated with larger tumor size and endocrine inactivity. Moreover, many components of the cAMP/PKA pathway were affected by somatic mutations, including three new mutations in the PRKACA gene, mutations in metabotropic glutamate receptors (GRM3, GRM4, GRM6) and others (GNAS, PRKAR1A, CREB1, CREBBP, ADCY3), being associated with female gender and over",2016,,,,,,,
06d15a9e46a2b3355ff9022050063ecadf9d5ca0,Cluster-Based Statistics for Brain Connectivity in Correlation with Behavioral Measures,"Graph theoretical approaches have successfully revealed abnormality in brain connectivity, in particular, for contrasting patients from healthy controls. Besides the group comparison analysis, a correlational study is also challenging. In studies with patients, for example, finding brain connections that indeed deepen specific symptoms is interesting. The correlational study is also beneficial since it does not require controls, which are often difficult to find, especially for old-age patients with cognitive impairment where controls could also have cognitive deficits due to normal ageing. However, one of the major difficulties in such correlational studies is too conservative multiple comparison correction. In this paper, we propose a novel method for identifying brain connections that are correlated with a specific cognitive behavior by employing cluster-based statistics, which is less conservative than other methods, such as Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate procedure, and extreme statistics. Our method is based on the insight that multiple brain connections, rather than a single connection, are responsible for abnormal behaviors. Given brain connectivity data, we first compute a partial correlation coefficient between every edge and the behavioral measure. Then we group together neighboring connections with strong correlation into clusters and calculate their maximum sizes. This procedure is repeated for randomly permuted assignments of behavioral measures. Significance levels of the identified sub-networks are estimated from the null distribution of the cluster sizes. This method is independent of network construction methods: either structural or functional network can be used in association with any behavioral measures. We further demonstrated the efficacy of our method using patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment. We identified sub-networks that are correlated with the disease severity by exploiting diffusion tensor imaging techniques. The identified sub-networks were consistent with the previous clinical findings having valid significance level, while other methods did not assert any significant findings.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cheol E.

62f24252b7a3a2b8de680a8e2c2aa823006d0a45,Comparison of AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Through Automated Hippocampal Segmentation,"We compared four automated methods for hippocampal segmentation using different machine learning algorithms: 1) hierarchical AdaBoost, 2) support vector machines (SVM) with manual feature selection, 3) hierarchical SVM with automated feature selection (Ada-SVM), and 4) a publicly available brain segmentation package (FreeSurfer). We trained our approaches using T1-weighted brain MRIs from 30 subjects [10 normal elderly, 10 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD)], and tested on an independent set of 40 subjects (20 normal, 20 AD). Manually segmented gold standard hippocampal tracings were available for all subjects (training and testing). We assessed each approach's accuracy relative to manual segmentations, and its power to map AD effects. We then converted the segmentations into parametric surfaces to map disease effects on anatomy. After surface reconstruction, we computed significance maps, and overall corrected p-values, for the 3-D profile of shape differences between AD and normal subjects. Our AdaBoost and Ada-SVM segmentations compared favorably with the manual segmentations and detected disease effects as well as FreeSurfer on the data tested. Cumulative p-value plots, in conjunction with the false discovery rate method, were used to examine the power of each method to detect correlations with diagnosis and cognitive scores. We also evaluated how segmentation accuracy depended on the size of the training set, providing practical information for future users of this technique.",2010,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan H.

85eb8f6b062d61b5a526eabed01bef12b80433df,Genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in fetal and adult human livers,"BackgroundThe liver plays a central role in the maintenance of homeostasis and health in general. However, there is substantial inter-individual variation in hepatic gene expression, and although numerous genetic factors have been identified, less is known about the epigenetic factors.ResultsBy analyzing the methylomes and transcriptomes of 14 fetal and 181 adult livers, we identified 657 differentially methylated genes with adult-specific expression, these genes were enriched for transcription factor binding sites of HNF1A and HNF4A. We also identified 1,000 genes specific to fetal liver, which were enriched for GATA1, STAT5A, STAT5B and YY1 binding sites. We saw strong liver-specific effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms on both methylation levels (28,447 unique CpG sites (meQTL)) and gene expression levels (526 unique genes (eQTL)), at a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05. Of the 526 unique eQTL associated genes, 293 correlated significantly not only with genetic variation but also with methylation levels. The tissue-specificities of these associations were analyzed in muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue. We observed that meQTL were more stable between tissues than eQTL and a very strong tissue-specificity for the identified associations between CpG methylation and gene expression.ConclusionsOur analyses generated a comprehensive resource of factors involved in the regulation of hepatic gene expression, and allowed us to estimate the proportion of variation in gene expression that could be attributed to genetic and epigenetic variation, both crucial to understanding differences in drug response and the etiology of liver diseases.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marc Jan Bonder"", ids = ""1695606""); list(name = ""Silva Kasela"", ids = ""1867754""); list(name = ""Mart Kals"", ids = ""2383115""); list(name = ""Riin Tamm"", ids = ""4207234""); list(name = ""Kaie Lokk"", ids = ""3955715""); list(name = ""Isabel BarragÃ¡n"", ids = ""145250264""); list(name = ""Wim A.

c0294950d4db5c415b6ea4329b76a1cd165650e2,Brain electrical activity in apparently healthy young people in a state of hypnosis,"Introduction: There are many ways to distinguish hypnosis from wakefulness. Materials and methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted in 21 young adults with 20 years apparently healthy in a state of hypnosis at the ""Juan Bruno Zayas"" hospital in Santiago de Cuba, during the period from September 2014 to June 2015 Objective: evaluate if the narrow band quantitative analysis allows to distinguish hypnosis from wakefulness. Results: In order to validate the statistical information, the Manova multivariate analysis of variance was used as a technique and, through the Nest statistical system, the difference between hypnosis and wakefulness was validated through the student's t 'test. Validation of the difference between the different levels of hypnotic depth was carried out through the Nest statistical system using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) statistic. For all hypothesis tests, a statistical significance level of 0.05 was considered. Conclusions: The narrow band quantitative analysis allows to differentiate the wakefulness of the hypnosis state, the multivariate analysis of the hypnotic depth level by derivation for each of the narrow band frequencies allows to identify the hypnotic depth level, in the quantitative analysis of The narrow band spectral parameters are concentrated in the largest frequency range with statistical significance in the theta band, the leads that obtain a greater range of frequencies with significant responses are located in the frontocentral region of the right hemisphere and central midline.",2020,Psychology,"list(name = ""Elizabeth MarÃ­a de la Paz Reyes"", ids = ""78970024""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Salvador Peacok"", ids = ""1583140132""); list(name = ""Ileana CutiÃ±o Clavel"", ids = ""79599733""); list(name = ""Cesar Brook Lageire"", ids = ""1583193999""); list(name = ""ArquÃ­medes Montoya PedrÃ³n"", ids = ""51899842""); list(name = ""Ricardo Javier LaborÃ­ de la Paz"", ids = ""1576952654"")",,,,38,

Gene expression was normalized to the geometric mean of GAPDH, ACTB, and RPLP0 as reference genes, and categorized into low and high values based on the median. The impact of gene expression on survival was analyzed using 5-year survival data. The Benjamini and Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate.ResultsIGF1R and AREG were most strongly correlated with overall survival, which was significantly worse in high IGF1R patients than low IGF1R patients, but better in high AREG patients than low AREG patients. The hazard ratio for death in the analysis of overall survival (S-1 vs. surgery alone) was reduced in the high IGF1R group compared with the low IGF1R group and in the low AREG group compared with the high AREG group. There were no significant interaction effects.ConclusionIGF1R gene expression was associated with poor outcomes after curative resection of stage II/III gastric cancer, whereas AREG gene expression was associated with good outcomes. No significant interaction effect on survival was evident between S-1 treatment and gene expression.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wataru Ichikawa"", ids = ""5449501""); list(name = ""Masanori Terashima"", ids = ""34747609""); list(name = ""Atsushi Ochiai"", ids = ""3887342""); list(name = ""Koji Kitada"", ids = ""4088369""); list(name = ""Issei Kurahashi"", ids = ""3080641""); list(name = ""Shinichi Sakuramoto"", ids = ""4334677""); list(name = ""Hitoshi Katai"", ids = ""4160769""); list(name = ""Takeshi Sano"", ids = ""145660523""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Imamura"", ids = ""32570355""); list(name = ""Mitsuru Sasako"", ids = ""6998202"")",6490aa85fcc31c840bc4c981bd642ed15664ea28; 9c4aae64aff675eee213805959d68609ea81befb; 3b87158e20fcdd89ca627339e1c3dd0596b98c4f; 2e078e4067a9c5a1880f3a8b7cd21cc279478f6c; 4552afdb4944de7f5c29562f472fba99c1b68176; b1d6ed5d094d22130b6779d75f1b07f4c167ddf1; 3e28b6a3142b390a849808738c416c780959fcfd; f1c855a810d22216bf67897c2ba0cf0bd5d14eeb,b89f6e59f3a24462d0bc4ab7cd7574b14d60b633; 42b70d8c3c9a282a43665d4a0a01d5f1b2e62eb1; 0244fd2618d53ae641260edac289a5fb2745cdfe; 76e32484fccaa866a0a58baaf13d7ddc9f0ef533; fd01e2b837adda3fbd136967a172ae15fcb07081; be4708535b8ffc831bbc40b811c0d19e17a171ac; f0e31a6556cf2258162ade9deb10092aa9a65629; c5fbb09d7347cb28160bf142ca0bab05b04a11c2; 19274c13baaeaa8610fc9996a460e3106665ae8d; 92d49bc9d98ef8f552073c17e12f516cf5a19a57; cf7b0744450e4d6286bdc3552960a5d68e957d8e; 1aba9fb2fa4fc12109291e034112038a7b147620; c0b1bff4916a1d98cd618f60647313d96aedbeb3; 0a63d38c4444a6ba3ee82afd7d9d876780a38051; 0e6c141096ed66af351f77411c46394ab215f392; 130ddf8a8e4c7814f5f5d06cdc84c71f01cf6280; 4c5e793225aec0857788f5579fc6d683bc8cfb43; e8439ee8712962b64daa214e8d3b448f92b0bbd7; adb8a6a7b5912713dc1a428eb217e484bd6091d9; 68d46191701f2c4cb804842f959333636d468657; 27949cb5d600022a127c629873bfe6a314ac18ed; 9eeaa4caced0dbc03a2a119fd8afeb26a4c721be; 8c84362527a6a05bbd7dc4824b071aad38db8b2a; 646b0068fa028a6a398b0495aad1f5efaeca5bd9; e5d5f0d757d591c4f86ef942937c12f0cc8cc267; 995fab15b8c5c6844db4a8c63c5080a1f00a1b1d; 57d08d36f3595efcfeb625c9152b96326eba3825; d83f3a6a7f1a63ee75832cf24dff204337bc6b99; 9cedf64d79d27a0f867902370e2d8d305429b4b1; 068a24f0d73cf17f5e59c3f9f0a0eaf43f90a2c7,Gastric Cancer,20,263 - 273

We study the problem of listing emerging patterns with a multiple testing guarantee. Recently, Terada et al., proposed the Limitless Arity Multiple-testing Procedure (LAMP) that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) in statistical association mining. LAMP reduces the number of ""untestable"" hypotheses without compromising its statistical power. Still, FWER is restrictive, and as a result, its statistical power is inherently unsatisfying when the number of patterns is large. On the other hand, the false discovery rate (FDR) is less restrictive than FWER, and thus controlling FDR yields a larger number of significant patterns. We propose two emerging pattern mining methods: the first one controls FWER, and the second one controls FDR.

7bf1baab44d9ea8fdad9b815aef7c9dd8317cd1e,Comparative assessment of methods for the fusion transcripts detection from RNA-Seq data,"RNA-Seq made possible the global identification of fusion transcripts, i.e. ""chimeric RNAs"". Even though various software packages have been developed to serve this purpose, they behave differently in different datasets provided by different developers. It is important for both users, and developers to have an unbiased assessment of the performance of existing fusion detection tools. Toward this goal, we compared the performance of 12 well-known fusion detection software packages. We evaluated the sensitivity, false discovery rate, computing time, and memory usage of these tools in four different datasets (positive, negative, mixed, and test). We conclude that some tools are better than others in terms of sensitivity, positive prediction value, time consumption and memory usage. We also observed small overlaps of the fusions detected by different tools in the real dataset (test dataset). This could be due to false discoveries by various tools, but could also be due to the reason that none of the tools are inclusive. We have found that the performance of the tools depends on the quality, read length, and number of reads of the RNA-Seq data. We recommend that users choose the proper tools for their purpose based on the properties of their RNA-Seq data.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shailesh Kumar"", ids = ""48084022""); list(name = ""Angie Duy Vo"", ids = ""32226419""); list(name = ""Fujun Qin"", ids = ""40491889""); list(name = ""Hui Li"", ids = ""40124580"")",483f529307a845e90d6d651b3020eb641f98cb4d; eb3f848e6d7f9a65b2186b722c360b1f69ec0b21; e43c3122366859b207c11c1c325d15b27ce858f7; 18c686dc810e700b571cd55ecd914ffa47cee575; d32e8a9f2912747fbfdaa8d5c2084ca1002f6e19; ebdf367148b5386b373c3c37d04a13325a0a044c; 1fd52dfb12f0b8ff9561258889ad62b19a39d270; 2171690125ce900ef2e5aff8933416644466bb00; ee9eed9d8e375356d134b544eccd9dcc00931515; 9c523180d4478ffc20992ee996e73269613979bb; 87585203d6c495b1bda6b7791b9d4d1d6f063ecd; 0fed24f8841df9fa1e0ca61179bae0ea76c36985; 282756e7b02f3355cc853d6cd50fa6ba38c3cc65; 1d1d9096f3f966674f9aced8a726bca9ee56265b; 378fdadcd164c681f7cb9a55e85737ae9d971930; 65f98b86562f5ec34664e6e80e7c89847d6907c4; f77016d97c7365526fa0b1f865452c090672f57e; fe848d1fa2c6b8155ce084574f32b64b4637beb3; e137e7f27916cb9b28bca1322249ce7abb3557da; 69a628db7dd7a3d4cf5375c6855f2d81a5f18c94; 382c9188e78b56a1f839e53e921be56a1ef04849; 4153e879068bf9f74db0a45a95d4a9bf6a483775; 352cf13d588c8a54d3aebc40c51b53910317906f; 7614c3447dc872ad4b1f97c93cefd619fca81552; 4f939dd3a32b0f70452fd52a7a18495da2c4ff1d; a5547945720bd7f2ce45395a30b7ae255251bb86; efeda4443cb25c0aa9e18ff1d0d71a404d8734b4; 9ab2434637a8a05f83d1f81bf4ded63dfca66649; 6ec64517b0b3a3e3e2c5bf9e30dfeab1e6de2921; 53ff7c50f85be24bfa975cc66c3a898935f0fd09; 95e367f2700fe5c37b0df3065fe52fb3525dabe6; d0b35951ee7539b8116d25ebd2978084c55ec4ff; 0122dd75703df6826d08badb03832a3926f33f46; 550afbfb309e1f03f2660ef39e00315875878ce5; 9cb8c781fc6c1f93f5d0a5d6a7ed7e2b77c3c872; 2cf284eb076a491e501b077de564f12ffeaf2a82; f2ecf42c9424d25573aff33890dfc1e6b7436cda; e3179d0ba4c9848696010999a1c5dd6feca1dbf3; bef424295cba120a759d0d8f2c3f21e9983c771b; 4256c9ac49284e98242b50e961cf33769ec37a51; 40f01933db80aef2005eed46d509dc9ab6d771a1; fa76ad94fbe1828adee5f4e7cb9a3b93f74501f5; a23d7cf5b340898bde1fc515d57f2841d25d0209; dc7227701ca9083dddd462be9fd371bcc600e20b; 97bc04b3bb6bd595d4b1f6800d50c70ccd2ab425; 7a6935509813d1c3ba6b063d75e76f13fb6c94b7; 7d398f5ff3fd8e18e06936534bb05148a313033e; c2413ce21af0326cc4cdbbd8be900573674189b2; c7caed768036af36ab51d235f630b70aa8d576c0; e9edc1498d30f1d3d548fbd1c7bc26c4deeb09ff; 840cb2cfa7c5a88a64e1ba5c5648f0511495ab3f; c88d076a4d7ff45dfff93bcc8019714c325cb66f; 465ecbe7fb5537c904e6903d98606ad018d34019; b9e8ed710a4be1df8dcfbdb9570ec842e6a3065f; 2bb6821465c4f16da7a595feb025965e27019270; 5a0bddf5eba7bccd5bacc76adb80bc5baeb6356f; 2a57ff5569faaa6908abed9c5d8c1fde0765a0bc; 3dd6f8a1074b75601f3c8c5c08fd97256ae95880; 9bcea94de303f0b3aa3eb86c62745167130098e8; 7e6275b454c089077ad5ccfb0da49fbe55faf3c8; 80d072029f3ca19aecafb112339998aa30c2065d; 8be203e0e3f917638ce737dde9347d85e685d20f; b9d1998539d35c972cdb8cd0e24b03c09223ea2a; c95d04b55107158684254aa6140e3a7fbb3d3b6a,d1a987c2445f4319ee2f0cc1b7e9ac73b41b4886; 3a0df4f9e99deab735ef4bf8b814c128e31c73f1; a41d01acab2eaf5da8cc6b8686b3bb08c38a253a; bb1223a03c8419afdea1c081ac5a4f5672e79f79; a0fd0d68b8ac1608e9bb593b1af4f44d51879e63; 2878976835c73ed0906e17a7336b9bf10d491a1a; 2b0b69a048adafdd728e42d46eefab4969e1f89b; 058c61d961bca9966e7e006b1b82c38f174893a1; 5a172f280df5aff228cdf4cb93a055e040498d65; 11fff7a61ee1ce7464baf495a4fd2ba4d07828c8; 8ac9d2d9ea9772af191cedc1e4808b975d51e048; 517db35980f5aae43e205325c3ea44d4faf2d087; 5cfa393e32dbc0003c903ee98cb424022cd581f4; 361d846ccefc5b3e7b896554682886a73cd71844; 5b7b53354cb349932ea192abfbbe76b4667b134a; 17aedeb48a5fb6089c3e5694483acafee8800696; 431afcad04e149c3543754ba55a0f97174e7e661; d9e6d3f9b6436b85e981c9f792f7e2fd46f9e022; 7dbf60d78dd613786b65e29764a9fd19ad160656; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; b07ffcd7d9b297aecdde011e6a8d95fe4c1c2911; 42f3486128a5e5be1db9a8fe9a124e43f602a5c8; 94337f064e0b0271f473c618f9de5d4d0b93e34b; b6de563c03eedf95d7e880a2aeb5688936ea1d26; 8a5ebb583684c9421db30c0dcafffb57e2cb2848; a3ca060aa78fd5ad5c13eecaf7f3d26b9a28e820; 58c5f5dc3f13ded7b667c815d7bbb6f500ea45fb; 5592d4f5b124323b9ebbc2095d541566622ed22d; 89490b06dc42186e0df69316ec80d0d32d0c0e6b; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; 89e50f2d395c831bf2bf699a6707e17db95b0f7c; e049bd1ef18a0f1cdb45477d957393cf9ef41c6d; d3b79e9b5b5bfdaae88e48c7ce980e85a119e433; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; e039dd47ead98e34d3de3a56bbfecefde79dc813; b581f178348cdb79130ed6b517a3257d62d9bc4d; ed1f2de5f1d1463ccded79dce737c0e581afc3d6; 8192d46d1422567c708ee9fb981bf39e89a64e87; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; c7fe8e804aaa1d1da829b9527232d851b8ae601d; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; 2af3d71c2d504d32ccdeeddcdb162185e756af8f,Scientific Reports,6,
6348de054e66afa814c98a2708cf96a0accb5d2b,Identification of three genetic variants as novel susceptibility loci for body mass index in a Japanese population,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified various obesity or metabolic syndrome (MetS) susceptibility loci. However, most studies were conducted in a cross-sectional manner. To address this gap, we performed a longitudinal exome-wide association study to identify susceptibility loci for obesity and MetS in a Japanese population. We traced clinical data of 6,022 Japanese subjects who had annual health check-ups for several years (mean follow-up period, 5 yr) and genotyped ~244,000 genetic variants. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with body mass index (BMI) or the prevalence of obesity and MetS was examined in a generalized estimating equation model. Our longitudinal exome-wide association studies detected 21 BMI- and five MetS-associated SNPs (false discovery rate, FDR <0.01). Among these SNPs, 16 have not been previously implicated as determinants of BMI or MetS. Cross-sectional data for obesity- and MetS-related phenotypes in 7,285 Japanese subjects were examined in a replication study. Among the 16 SNPs, three ( rs9491140 , rs145848316 , and rs7863248 ) were related to BMI in the replication cohort ( P < 0.05). In conclusion, three SNPs [ rs9491140 of NKAIN2 (FDR = 0.003, P = 1.9 Ã— 10-5), rs145848316 of KMT2C (FDR = 0.007, P = 4.5 Ã— 10-5), and rs7863248 of AGTPBP1 (FDR = 0.006, P = 4.2 Ã— 10-5)] were newly identified as susceptibility loci for BMI.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshiki Yasukochi"", ids = ""8544496""); list(name = ""Jun Sakuma"", ids = ""46764062""); list(name = ""Ichiro Takeuchi"", ids = ""48050234""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Hideki Horibe"", ids = ""3512685""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",740896698975351c52d47a7083a7b880b6ece2e1,,Physiological Genomics,50,179 - 189
9f34fd26d322d760c81a546cc0f988837c127f58,P18-17 Intra-oral object recognition enhances swallowing-related brain activation,"Methods: In this fMRI study 15 healthy, left-handed subjects (28.9Â±9.6 years) and 11 healthy right-handed subjects (35.5Â±8.6 years) performed bimanual index finger abductions and adductions. In a 2x3 paradigm, subjects had to move their index fingers either in symmetric or in parallel mode in a congruous position, i.e. both palms down, and in two incongruous positions, i.e. either the left or right palm up, respectively. fMRI data were analysed with general linear model (random effects analysis) in an omnibus statistics and with small volume correction based on the main movement effect of all six conditions in comparison with rest. Significant signal changes had a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 exceeding clusters of 50 activated voxels. Results: In the incongruous conditions compared with the congruous condition, there was an fMRI-signal increase in a bilateral fronto-parietal network involving motor, premotor somatosensory, and inferior parietal cortical areas. Whereas turning the right hand evoked a predominantly contralateral pattern in right-handers, activations were more bilaterally in the left-handers. In addition, the occipito-temporal cortex probably corresponding to human visual area MT was activated bilaterally in the left-handers. The activation of area MT was specific for the incongruouscongruous contrast in the left-handers but detectable in comparison with rest also in the right-handers. Conclusion: Our observations show extra-activations in sensorimotor control areas during a perceptual dissociation in rightand left-handers. In addition, our data suggest an involvement of visual imagery in the sensory guidance of bimanual coordination in left-handers.",2010,Psychology,"list(name = ""Toshiaki Ieda"", ids = ""5934643""); list(name = ""Keiichi Onoda"", ids = ""49257289""); list(name = ""Shuhei Yamaguchi"", ids = ""78030384"")",,,Clinical Neurophysiology,121,
9d5cf4e08781d9b3148dc11cf02257922e4b5451,Fine mapping and detection of the causative mutation underlying Quantitative Trait Loci.,"The effect on power and precision of including the causative SNP amongst the investigated markers in Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping experiments was investigated. Three fine mapping methods were tested to see which was most efficient in finding the causative mutation: combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium mapping (LLD); association mapping (MARK); a combination of LLD and association mapping (LLDMARK). Two simulated data sets were analysed: in one set, the causative SNP was included amongst the markers, while in the other set the causative SNP was masked between markers. Including the causative SNP amongst the markers increased both precision and power in the analyses. For the LLD method the number of correctly positioned QTL increased from 17 for the analysis without the causative SNP to 77 for the analysis including the causative SNP. The likelihood of the data analysis increased from 3.4 to 13.3 likelihood units for the MARK method when the causative SNP was included. When the causative SNP was masked between the analysed markers, the LLD method was most efficient in detecting the correct QTL position, while the MARK method was most efficient when the causative SNP was included as a marker in the analysis. The LLDMARK method, combining association mapping and LLD, assumes a QTL as the null hypothesis (using LLD method) and tests whether the 'putative causative SNP' explains significantly more variance than a QTL in the region. Thus, if the putative causative SNP does not only give an Identical-By-Descent (IBD) signal, but also an Alike-In-State (AIS) signal, LLDMARK gives a positive likelihood ratio. LLDMARK detected less than half as many causative SNPs as the other methods, and also had a relatively high false discovery rate when the QTL effect was large. LLDMARK may however be more robust against spurious associations, because the regional IBD is largely corrected for by fitting a QTL effect in the null hypothesis model.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Eivind Uleberg"", ids = ""6630242""); list(name = ""Theo H.

d93112827d32de070a33f6344a78f9d36cf27507,Mo1802 Intestinal Dysbiosis in Collagenous Colitis,"Background The etiology and pathogenesis of collagenous colitis (CC) are incompletely known. Similar to other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), an aberrant immune response to various unidentified luminal factors, particularly the intestinal microbiota, seems to play an important role. Aim We aimed to compare the microbiotic profile between patients with CC, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and healthy controls (HC). Methods Fecal samples were collected from patients at the out-patient clinic; UC (n=32), CD (n=32) and CC (n=29). Healthy controls (n=29) were matched by sex and age (+/-5 years) to the CC group. DNA was extracted through the Arrow Stool DNA cartridge using the Arrow Instrument (NorDiag). The hypervariable V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR and analyzed using high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing (Roche). The sequence data was filtered from bad quality sequences, denoised using AmpliconNoise and taxonomically classified using the SILVA database. Alpha diversity was assessed by Shannon's diversity index and beta diversity by a Bonferroni corrected ANOSIM analysis, using Bray Curtis metrics as distance index. Differences in operative taxonomic units (OTUs) between groups of patients were analyzed by Wilcoxon's test, False discovery rate was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results The dataset contained 349 963 sequences with an average of 2 869 sequences/sample. Three samples (2 CC and 1 UC) were excluded due to low number of sequences. There was no difference in Shannon's diversity index between patients with CC and HC (p=0.54). Analysis of the beta diversity using ANOSIM showed that the CC group segregated from the HC with increasing taxonomic resolution, reaching significance at the highest taxonomic resolution when operative taxonomic unit data (OTU) were compared (p=0.03). Wilcoxon's test was further used to identify which OTUs that contributed to this difference. We found that several OTUs belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family were underrepresented in the CC group compared with the controls. Similarly, the beta diversity of patients with CD differed significantly from the HC and segregated already at a phylum level (p=0.007). In addition, the CD cohort was characterized by a lower Shannon's diversity index (p<0.001). The beta diversity of patients with UC did not significantly differ from the HC (p=0.08 p=1.0), but the UC cohort was characterized by a lower alpha diversity (p=0.02). Conclusion The fecal microbiotic profile of CC differs from HC and is characterized by a lower abundance of OTUs belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family. Intriguingly, underrepresentation of the Ruminococcaceae family has previously been associated with CD indicating that the microbiotic profile of CC share features with the profile of CD. 1.Morgan XC, Et. al.

f9d86ccb73cb4c1b82a95ed6971a8d1bdf12503c,Signal detection in FDA AERS database using Dirichlet process.,"In the recent two decades, data mining methods for signal detection have been developed for drug safety surveillance, using large post-market safety data. Several of these methods assume that the number of reports for each drug-adverse event combination is a Poisson random variable with mean proportional to the unknown reporting rate of the drug-adverse event pair. Here, a Bayesian method based on the Poisson-Dirichlet process (DP) model is proposed for signal detection from large databases, such as the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Instead of using a parametric distribution as a common prior for the reporting rates, as is the case with existing Bayesian or empirical Bayesian methods, a nonparametric prior, namely, the DP, is used. The precision parameter and the baseline distribution of the DP, which characterize the process, are modeled hierarchically. The performance of the Poisson-DP model is compared with some other models, through an intensive simulation study using a Bayesian model selection and frequentist performance characteristics such as type-I error, false discovery rate, sensitivity, and power. For illustration, the proposed model and its extension to address a large amount of zero counts are used to analyze statin drugs for signals using the 2006-2011 AERS data.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Na Hu"", ids = ""49060733""); list(name = ""Lan Huang"", ids = ""145899449""); list(name = ""Ram C.

7eebe5c0694cff2cdd2e7eb0da0104cd41e1e7cd,Automated Detection of High Frequency Oscillations in Intracranial EEG Using the Combination of Short-Time Energy and Convolutional Neural Networks,"High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) of 80~500 Hz in the intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings are considered as a reliable marker for epileptic location. However, a significant challenge to the clinical use of HFOs is due to the time-consuming procedure of visually identifying them. A new methodology is presented in this paper for the automated detection of HFOs based on their 2D timeâ€“frequency map employing the short-time energy (STE) estimation and the convolutional neural network (CNN) classification algorithm. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method are evaluated using the clinical iEEG data acquired from five patients (28.4 Â± 13.0 years) with medically intractable epilepsy. The proposed methodology presents the following significant advantages: 1) compared with the recently reported HFOs detector based on the CNN using only the 1D temporal EEG signal, the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy using the deep CNN classifier on 2D timeâ€“frequency map of HFOs, of which the evaluated sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) for identifying ripples are 88.16% and 12.58%, respectively, and the corresponding sensitivity and FDR are 93.37% and 8.1% for detecting fast ripples, respectively; 2) it is capable of automatically extracting the shared features of HFOs events of different patients and would be much robust, unlike other automated methodologies proposed in the literature where the characteristics of HFOs were extracted manually on the basis of researchersâ€™ knowledge, which, probably, is prone to observer bias; and 3) with the proposed STE estimation, all suspicious ripples and fast ripples could be initially found out and transformed into timeâ€“frequency map for subsequently CNN-based classification, rather than transforming and classifying the raw data, thus requiring a lower computational resource. In addition, the time occurrence of each transient event of the HFOs can be identified to be potentially useful for further seizure analysis. In conclusion, this automated detection of the HFOs combing the STE and the CNN could allow analyzing large amounts of data in a short time while assuring a relatively higher accuracy and, thus, would potentially serve to provide a clinically useful tool.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dakun Lai"", ids = ""12413964""); list(name = ""Xinyue Zhang"", ids = ""46448082""); list(name = ""Kefei Ma"", ids = ""150175059""); list(name = ""Zichu Chen"", ids = ""150356037""); list(name = ""Wenjing Chen"", ids = ""47482879""); list(name = ""Heng Yu Zhang"", ids = ""37318479""); list(name = ""Han Yuan"", ids = ""144598794""); list(name = ""Lei Ding"", ids = ""48082804"")",c16b76f601d5dbb745e0ee9f5c475d535ad73abd; c9a5ecf393a82bcdf3a04676ed36e1f1fc8aefff; 7157b739fed4598e47c76896ca56d46174e901cc; b0ccc21d7b0fef9d2a576ef8fda5bc3a9c70828f; cb95f4cc2cb8d333701ce3ae1754494b9879123a,54ba56866b634daa78fc9078d7f007091ab45956; eb6cd1871e2c9a516d73a19e9c20262074874332; 7a1b770d589aed128a8dadde17a5f11271375e53; abd1c342495432171beb7ca8fd9551ef13cbd0ff; a13d3a970170284c609b3d2a075c012ebfd493dd; bfc544ca90be8033097e3602de09f42651d1e92d; 46b7a37d9e88f0150ff7d64c7ba9e4b738930c5c; db5ee23f765ec74b06e54816288877109aa70717; 8d1c1184c340201cc6439e4047cc8ef35978343d; cfa6d5a2ad0edf52ae55e353e35bf2e88ece21f0; c50ebc78e91dc47f03ac64aeb81f161f89816aed; 6974d29613bc027fa4c3e77086c14ebdd246dc95; 09b3c396d9a5b59057c7514ad41afbbfac9c7444; 01415b95567eb66993dca0baf507c1d7bdadfca6; 43ddd7ab91dcfd0f3df8fa8021b0f8827cb75d9b; 258e80bbf3c013fda6b3f66d0b459d0da3492044; 8a423bd33b735d0055629e270184417b05df56ac; 1640578f37726a3c269b807e681a1e6b09a8c346; 61932351d7870d15761da5101b850ceaac52ef9c; 0dee1827f364629e214396df69e2bf6a338d8cf0; 7c5fa468cda2352c1d6a00a93dc078f176e6cf25; 1f5d14e3ac6d8b762238fc0037b1193328acdc17; 47451456347529b5d5793eb4050a09ad4e8f5a7e; 6827b7abcdc6f9c0f91e239b4da394251aff35bd; 842dd6d0f4b72ce0e8f3ac8e6861637c1f4645ea; e66399a08a9a75ddd96a5c921c4b6f5ffde7a518; fbd8c519075d6c9d5b3a6164ed05b1b5c98d2609; f9f7f4a3dfeeaf0bf99237f1eae185d91d11e175; 657bfc44753d02bf7334cc382bb49d6579be1f48; a176b8f1db79a1bc27f93698583a378cefc3f168,IEEE Access,7,82501-82511
75e795b7e5f336fd771b14a3a0d26024644d8999,Discussion: An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and applications to top medical journals by Jager and Leek.,"The original paper by Ioannidis (2005) has done much to raise the awareness to the possible sources of biases in current scientific work. However, Ioannidis described what may be happening in the scientific literature if scientists use blindly the marginal 0.05 significance level rule throughout their work. From this possibility, he reached the alarming conclusion that most research findings are false. In the current work, Prof. Jager and Prof. Leek took it upon themselves to find what actually is happening in current medical research if we assume that the practice is to publish only the findings significant at the 0.05 level. Since Ioannidis was actually arguing about the false discovery rate (FDR) in research (without using this terminology), they utilized FDR methods that are being used in a single research project to study the phenomenon across studies. They further developed modeling tools to address the peculiarities of the data they encountered, such as rounding to specific digits, and they developed relevant text extraction algorithms, allowing them to collect data on the entire population of important medical papers. Finally, they produced the analysis in a reproducible way, which allows everyone to repeat, check, and modify their analysis (as we did). All in all, we congratulate them for shouldering the challenge in such a way. We raise three questions. (1) Does the âˆ¼ 14Â± 1% science-wise FDR reflect the situation in medical research? (2) How can we improve the estimation? (3) Whatever the actual number is, if it is well above the perceived 5% FDR, how can it be brought under control? (1) Is it 14Â± 1%? Unfortunately, this is not clear. There are problems with some of the decisions made as to the statements collected for the analysis: (i) only â€œp < 0.05â€ and typographical variations to it, but not â€œp 0.05â€, (ii) only statements regarding significance expressed as â€œp =â€ and typographical variations to it, but not confidence intervals, and (iii) only statements from the Abstracts were analyzed. Each one of these decisions affects the estimate.",2014,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoav Benjamini"", ids = ""1808156""); list(name = ""Yotam Hechtlinger"", ids = ""5395574"")",479a565b678c78881326bcdb074c24bead02d883; ee1bda2e75ffa8acfb49c7cc5f5d909f581accdb; 182ebb0accae659c034417df862148a655388d08; a6beda91090825037ba7b11646c6040c4d5c61cb; a7fbfe5b46c428e17e93c1769b6eff2d8bce4141; 0e16a834632c2b54e746b1851afc1f3beccb1e53; 276feb251fa166d9776a5927e88181fc486600b8; df4c369b984524801d47ad2ef7a0f52829a43c5c; 217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; de8d165001f208ce2e6055f96e609d0b79acabce; a07a64ba110e0f9f7156f3bd1e376f0d2e1cddf1; 70f161b72c0cb03cc6486d572a41b6626b533f2b; 5e135e926c3bcfd62de9086ef09551f6fed876f9; eb27d91a99a19a5ff7353b0b00ad930efd40e89e; aad37e982431c42720afbe945997f56d68cd854a; 4750b9e002ec9621ee087fffffe8152aeb5afce2,51c915a7e3920aed75b66d950bcbaede47c5477d; a7e66d7436849cbd19e6991d2c4d06fb06580a79; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; 59ac99583c8c5ec9de91932ce2397baf81e84f4d,Biostatistics,15 1,"

de927b5a56d9a63c6bb75042fe78afa6c59dd687,Gene expression Sample size for FDR-control in microarray data analysis,"Summary: We consider identifying differentially expressing genes between two patient groups using microarray experiment. We propose a sample size calculation method for a specified number of true rejections while controlling the false discovery rate at a desired level. Input parameters for the sample size calculation include the allocation proportion in each group, the number of genes in each array, the number of differentially expressing genes and the effect sizes among the differentially expressing genes. We have a closed-form sample size formula if the projected effect sizes are equal among differentially expressing genes. Otherwise, our method requires a numerical method to solve an equation. Simulation studies are conducted to show that the calculated sample sizes are accurate in practical settings. The proposed method is demonstrated with a real study.

b189eafc264ca3f08a1b6c9e9d12649fc89b0b79,Unique footprints of HLA class I on clade C HIV-1 in a cohort of Ethiopian patients,"Background: Despite the enormous genetic diversity of HIV, this virus follows predictable pathways of immune escape in response to immune selection pressure. Because there are substantial differences in HLA allele and haplotype frequency across different populations worldwide, differences in viral diversity at a population level may be seen. Here we characterized the HLA genotypes and associated HIV imprinting in a cohort of Ethiopian patients from Ethiopia and Israel. 
 
Methods: HIV infected, ARV-naive patients (n = 356) were recruited from clinics around Ethiopia and in Israel (Ethiopian Jewish immigrants). Sequence-based high resolution HLA typing was performed, as well as full-length viral sequencing using both Sanger and 454 deep pyrosequencing techniques. HLA-HIV sequence associations have been corrected for viral phylogenetic relatedness. To correct for multiple comparisons only associations with false discovery rate equal or lesser than 0.2 were considered. 
 
Results: There were 36 different HLA-A, 49 HLA-B, and 24 HLA-C alleles detected in this cohort. No major differences in allele frequencies were found between patients recruited in Ethiopia and Ethiopian Jews living in Israel. However, significant differences in HLA class I allele frequencies were found between these patients and the published frequencies in a cohort of clade C infected patients from South Africa. In this regard, alleles uniquely described in the past among Africans were much more frequent among South Africans compared with Ethiopians. Unusual high rates of HLA-B57 and HLA-B13 (population frequency of 18.2% and 12.3%, respectively), which are associated with disease control, were found among this Ethiopian cohort. Associations analysis revealed the highest associations density within HIV proteins rev and tat in contrast with the structural proteins as shown in other associations studies. The analysis reproduced many previously described HLA-associated HIV polymorphisms both in African and Caucasian cohorts, but new targets for selective pressure were found. 
 
Conclusions: This is the first work to characterize comprehensively and at a large scale an African cohort from Ethiopia, and the first to apply deep pyrosequencing to HLA-HIV association analysis. We found the unique HLA background of the Ethiopian cohort is associated with unique viral imprinting.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Dennis E.

52583547a18fdc1f04f83209964431a81498cca8,Genetic Variation in MAP3K1 Associates with Ventilatorâ€Free Days in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"&NA; Mitogenâ€activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1) regulates numerous intracellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation and apoptosis. We hypothesized that genetic variation in MAP3K1 might be associated with outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and that these variants would alter MAP3K1â€mediated changes in inflammation and transcriptional regulation. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped singleâ€nucleotide polymorphisms covering linkage disequilibrium bins in MAP3K1 in 306 subjects with ARDS from the ARDSNet FACTT (Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial) study, and tested for associations between MAP3K1 singleâ€nucleotide polymorphisms and ventilatorâ€free days (VFDs) and mortality. We then validated these associations in a separate cohort of 241 patients with ARDS from Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA). We found the variant allele of rs832582 (MAP3K1906Val) was significantly associated with decreased VFDs using multivariate linear regression (âˆ’6.1 d, false discovery rate = 0.06) in the FACTT cohort. In the Harborview Medical Center cohort, subjects homozygous for MAP3K1906Val also had decreased VFDs (âˆ’15.1 d, false discovery rate < 0.01), and increased 28â€day mortality (all subjects homozygous for the rare allele died). In whole blood stimulated with various innate immune agonists ex vivo, MAP3K1906Val was associated with increased ILâ€1&bgr;, ILâ€6, ILâ€8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and TNFâ€&agr; production. Transcriptome analysis of whole blood stimulated with Tollâ€like receptor 4 agonist ex vivo demonstrated enrichment of inflammatory gene sets in subjects homozygous for MAP3K1906Val. Our findings show a robust association between the variant allele of rs832582 (MAP3K1906Val) and decreased VFDs in patients with ARDS and suggest that this variant may predispose individuals to a greater inflammatory response.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric D.

c1c230d99f3002ffcb5ca2d9682d8d820c5d76eb,Novel common variants associated with body mass index and coronary artery disease detected using a pleiotropic cFDR method.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with body mass index (BMI) and coronary heart disease (CAD). However, the SNPs to date can only explain a small percentage of the genetic variances of traits. Here, we applied a genetic pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method that combines summary statistic p values from different multi-center GWAS datasets, to detect common genetic variants associated with these two traits. The enrichment of SNPs associated with BMI and CAD was assessed by conditional Q-Q plots and the common variants were identified by the cFDR method. By applying the cFDR level of 0.05, 7 variants were identified to be associated with CAD (2 variants being novel), 34 variants associated with BMI (11 variants being novel), and 3 variants associated with both BMI and CAD (2 variants being novel). The SNP rs653178 (ATXN2) is noteworthy as this variant was replicated in an independent analysis. SNP rs12411886 (CNNM2) and rs794356 (HIP1) were of note as the annotated genes may be associated with processes that are functionally important in lipid metabolism.

4d2d514b027614c709f16905022857af38dfe528,The oviductal transcriptome is influenced by a local ovarian effect in the sow,"BackgroundOviducts participate in fertilization and early embryo development, and they are influenced by systemic and local circulation. Local functional interplay between ovary, oviduct and uterus is important, as deduced from the previously observed differences in hormone concentrations, presence of sperm, or patterns of motility in the oviduct after unilateral ovariectomy (UO). However, the consequences of unilateral ovariectomy on the oviductal transcriptome remain unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the consequences of UO in a higher animal model as the pig.MethodsThe influence of UO was analyzed on the number of ovulations on the contra ovary, which was increased, and on the ipsilateral oviductal transcriptome. Microarray analysis was performed and the results were validated by PCR. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a fold change â‰¥â€‰2 and a false discovery rate of 10Â % were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify the main biofunctions affected by UO.ResultsData revealed two principal effects in the ipsilateral oviduct after UO: i) down-regulation of genes involved in the survival of sperm in the oviduct and early embryonic development, and ii) up-regulation of genes involved in others functions as protection against external agents and tumors.ConclusionsResults showed that unilateral ovariectomy results in an increased number of ovulation points on the contra ovary and changes in the transcriptome of the ipsilateral oviduct with consequences on key biological process that could affect fertility output.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebeca LÃ³pez-Ãšbeda"", ids = ""1401290609""); list(name = ""Marta MuÃ±oz"", ids = ""144605016""); list(name = ""Luis Alberto Vieira"", ids = ""49999956""); list(name = ""Ronald H.

In this paper, we establish sharp Cramer-type moderate deviation theorems for Studentized two-sample $U$-statistics in a general framework, including the two-sample $t$-statistic and Studentized Mann-Whitney test statistic as prototypical examples. In particular, a refined moderate deviation theorem with second-order accuracy is established for the two-sample $t$-statistic. These results extend the applicability of the existing statistical methodologies from the one-sample $t$-statistic to more general nonlinear statistics.

To identify transcriptional changes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the metastatic progression of BC and to determine the prognostic role of these DEGs in clinical outcome, we compared transcriptome profiling in matched normal, cancer, and lymph node metastatic tissues of 7 patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative BC by using massive parallel RNA sequencing. The global profiles of gene expression in cancer and nodal metastases were highly correlated (r=0.962, P<0.001). In 6 (85.8%) patients, cancer and corresponding nodal metastases from the same patient clustered together. We identified 1522 and 664 DEGs between normal and cancer and between cancer and nodal metastases, respectively. The DEGs in normal versus cancer and cancer versus nodal metastases were significantly clustered in 1 and 8 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, respectively. The chemokine signaling pathway was the most significant pathway in the cancer-to-nodal metastasis transition (false discovery rate=2.15E-13). The expression of 2 dysregulated RAC2 and PTGDS genes was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, the lower RAC2 and PTGDS expression were associated with significantly worse disease-free survival in patients with BC. Our results show a high concordance of gene expression in BC and their nodal metastases, and identify DEGs associated with the metastatic progression of BC.

f06288e508928f812140f0b49204a20903cd748b,Elevated peritoneal fluid ceramides in human endometriosis-associated infertility and their effects on mouse oocyte maturation.,"OBJECTIVE
To characterize the peritoneal fluid (PF) sphingolipid profile in endometriosis-associated infertility (EAI), and to assess the plausible functional role(s) of ceramides in oocyte maturation potential.


DESIGN
Retrospective case-control study and inÂ vitro mouse oocyte study.


SETTING
University-affiliated hospital and university laboratory.


SUBJECTS
Twenty-seven infertile patients diagnosed with endometriosis and 20 infertile patients who did not have endometriosis; BALB/c female mice.


INTERVENTION(S)
None.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
PF sphingolipid concentrations. Number of metaphase II (MII) mouse oocytes.


RESULT(S)
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed 11 significantly elevated PF sphingolipids in infertile women with severe endometriosis compared with infertile women without endometriosis (change >50%, false discovery rate â‰¤10%). Logistic regression analysis identified three very-long-chain ceramides potentially associated with EAI. Functional studies revealed that very-long-chain ceramides may compromise or induce murine MII oocyte maturation. The oocyte maturation effects induced by the very long-chain ceramides were triggered by alterations in mitochondrial superoxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. Scavenging of mitochondrial superoxide reversed the maturation effects of C24:0 ceramide.


CONCLUSION(S)
EAI is associated with accumulation of PF very-long-chain ceramides. Mouse studies demonstrated how ceramides affect MII oocyte maturation, mediating through mitochondrial superoxide. These results provide an opportunity for direct functional readout of pathophysiology in EAI, and future therapies targeted at this sphingolipid metabolism may be harnessed for improved oocyte maturation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yie Hou Lee"", ids = ""3141454""); list(name = ""Joan Xiaohui Yang"", ids = ""47988601""); list(name = ""John Carson Allen"", ids = ""145075742""); list(name = ""Chuen Seng Tan"", ids = ""21737084""); list(name = ""Bernard Su Min Chern"", ids = ""34726571""); list(name = ""Tse Yeun Tan"", ids = ""14146693""); list(name = ""Heng Tan"", ids = ""4776828""); list(name = ""Citra N Z Mattar"", ids = ""51265157""); list(name = ""Jerry Kok Yen Chan"", ids = ""144431913"")",b7e49aca799c790e757b6ee67e38804e0dc3bdd0,,Fertility and sterility,110 4,"

The aim of the present study is to analyze the relationships between functional polymorphisms in genes encoding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), platelet derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable CAD undergoing their first coronary angiography.MethodsIn total, 319 patients with stable CAD who underwent their first coronary angiography at the Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland were included in the analysis. CAD burden was assessed using the Gensini score. The TaqMan method was used for genotyping of selected functional polymorphisms in the FGF2, PDGFB, TGFB1, IGF1 and VEGFA genes, while rs4444903 in the EGF gene was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The associations between the selected polymorphisms and the Gensini were calculated both for the whole cohort and for a subgroup of patients without previous myocardial infarction (MI).ResultsThere were no differences in the distribution of the Gensini score between the genotypes of the analyzed polymorphisms in FGF2, EGF, IGF1, PDFGB, and TGFB1 in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of patients without previous MI. The Gensini score for VEGFA rs699947 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in patients without previous myocardial infarction, after correction for multiple testing, was highest in patients with the A/A genotype, lower in heterozygotes and lowest in patients with the C/C genotype, (p value for trendâ€‰=â€‰0.013, false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.02). After adjustment for clinical variables, and correction for multiple comparisons the association between the VEGFA genotype and Gensini score remained only nominally significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.19) under the dominant genetic model in patients without previous MI.ConclusionsWe were unable to find strong association between analyzed polymorphisms in growth factors and the severity of coronary artery disease, although there was a trend toward association between rs699947 and the severity of CAD in patients without previous MI.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tadeusz Osadnik"", ids = ""6956122""); list(name = ""Joanna Katarzyna Strzelczyk"", ids = ""153421765""); list(name = ""Andrzej Lekston"", ids = ""6208270""); list(name = ""RafaÅ‚ ReguÅ‚a"", ids = ""1401129904""); list(name = ""Kamil Bujak"", ids = ""6934742""); list(name = ""Martyna Fronczek"", ids = ""7281126""); list(name = ""Marcin Gawlita"", ids = ""7686902""); list(name = ""MaÅ‚gorzata Gonera"", ids = ""8266369""); list(name = ""JarosÅ‚aw P.

However, few studies have focused on the in vitro molecular mechanisms involved in the response of the goat mammary gland to t10c12-CLA. In the present study, RNA sequencing technology was used to investigate the effects of t10c12-CLA on goat mammary epithelial cells. From the data, 25,153 annotated transcripts were obtained, and differentially expressed genes were selected based on a false discovery rate <0.05. Candidate genes and potent cellular signaling pathways were identified through Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. Next, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses were used to verify the results of the RNA sequencing data. The results indicated that t10c12-CLA inhibits fatty acid synthesis through downregulation of genes involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis, and this process is likely correlated with the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tianying Zhang"", ids = ""4207450""); list(name = ""JiangTao Huang"", ids = ""1852011""); list(name = ""Huibin Tian"", ids = ""46985182""); list(name = ""Yulei Ma"", ids = ""12020324""); list(name = ""Zhi Chen"", ids = ""144167068""); list(name = ""Jingjing Wang"", ids = ""1734704""); list(name = ""Hengbo Shi"", ids = ""4560150""); list(name = ""Jingxian Luo"", ids = ""20510748"")",56af65441ed1b4c3f80ee0c5e270af66da322aa0; efb1cf0b5b651661ca8b49943d6995a724e253d8; 0f0ae715587ac32c48b93403dc6be68f108ebb6b,,Journal of dairy science,101 6,"

d641f13c61043c1998e57ad9072f5646c07cf505,Associations of Circulating Protein Levels With Lipid Fractions in the General Population,"Objectiveâ€” Revealing patterns of associations between circulating protein and lipid levels could improve biological understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study, we investigated the associations between proteins related to CVD and triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels in individuals from the general population. Approach and Resultsâ€” We measured plasma protein levels using the Olink ProSeek CVD I or II+III arrays and analyzed 57 proteins available in 3 population-based cohorts: EpiHealth (n=2029; 52% women; median age, 61 years), PIVUS (Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors; n=790; 51% women; all aged 70 years), and ULSAM (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men; n=551; all men aged 77 years). A discovery analysis was performed in EpiHealth in a regression framework (adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, smoking, glucose levels, systolic blood pressure, blood pressure medication, diabetes mellitus medication, and CVD history), and associations with false discovery rate <0.05 were further tested in PIVUS and ULSAM, where a P value of 0.05 was considered a successful replication (validation false discovery rate of 0.1%). We used summary statistics from a genome-wide association study on each protein biomarker (meta-analysis of EpiHealth, PIVUS, ULSAM, and IMPROVE [Carotid Intimaâ€“Media Thickness and IMT-Progression as Predictors of Vascular Events in a High-Risk European Population]) and publicly available data from Global Lipids Genetics Consortium to perform Mendelian randomization analyses to address possible causality of protein levels. Of 57 tested proteins, 42 demonstrated an association with at least 1 lipid fraction; 35 were associated with TG, 15 with total cholesterol, 9 with LDL cholesterol, and 24 with HDL cholesterol. Among these associations, we found KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1), TNFR (TNF [tumor necrosis factor] receptor) 1 and 2, TRAIL-R2 (TRAIL [TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand] receptor 2), and RETN (resistin) to be associated with all 4 lipid fractions. Further, 15 proteins were related to both TG and HDL cholesterol in a consistent and biologically expected manner, that is, higher TG and lower HDL cholesterol or vice versa. Another common pattern of associations was concomitantly higher TG, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, which is associated with higher CVD risk. We did not find evidence of causal links for protein levels.

2fe56c129efb09d6df8d5aca43de5ebfbafe4f45,MR Imaging Correlates for Molecular and Mutational Analyses in Children with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Recent advances in molecular techniques have characterized distinct subtypes of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Our aim was the identification of MR imaging correlates of these subtypes.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Initial MRIs from subjects with diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas recruited for a prospective clinical trial before treatment were analyzed. Retrospective imaging analyses included FLAIR/T2 tumor volume, tumor volume enhancing, the presence of cyst and/or necrosis, median, mean, mode, skewness, kurtosis of ADC tumor volume based on FLAIR, and enhancement at baseline. Molecular subgroups based on EGFR and MGMT mutations were established. Histone mutations were also determined (H3F3A, HIST1H3B, HIST1H3C). Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association of imaging predictors with overall and progression-free survival. Wilcoxon rank sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and Fisher exact tests were used to compare imaging measures among groups.


RESULTS
Fifty patients had biopsy and MR imaging. The median age at trial registration was 6â€‰years (range, 3.3-17.5â€‰years); 52% were female. On the basis of immunohistochemical results, 48 patients were assigned to 1 of 4 subgroups: 28 in MGMT-/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-, 14 in MGMT-/EGFR+, 3 in MGMT+/EGFR-, and 3 in MGMT+/EGFR+. Twenty-three patients had histone mutations in H3F3A, 8 in HIST1H3B, and 3 in HIST1H3C. Enhancing tumor volume was near-significantly different across molecular subgroups (Pâ€‰=â€‰.04), after accounting for the false discovery rate. Tumor volume enhancing, median, mode, skewness, and kurtosis ADC T2-FLAIR/T2 were significantly different (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰.048) between patients with H3F3A and HIST1H3B/C mutations.

eae241fdd39938b8aba29c0ceec66415451cdad7,88 MicroRNA profile of in vitro bovine embryos cultured in the presence of amniotic extracellular vesicles shifts toward in vivo-collected blastocysts,"The absence of maternal-embryo signals could be an important cause of the poor pregnancy rates of inâ€‰vitro-produced embryos, compared with those collected inâ€‰vivo. In the context of paracrine communication, co-culture of embryo with amniotic-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) improved their quality compared with control (CTR) (Perrini and Lange Consiglio 2018 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 30, 658-671), and after cryopreservation, provided higher inâ€‰vitro embryo hatching and recipient pregnancy rate (Lange-Consiglio et al. 2019 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 31, 155). After these results, the aim of this study was to evaluate microRNA (miRNA) profiling of inâ€‰vitro-produced blastocysts with or without EV supplementation, using inâ€‰vivo-produced blastocysts as CTR. Inâ€‰vitro embryos were produced based on our protocol (Perrini and Lange Consiglio 2018 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 30, 658-671) with or without 100â€‰Ã—â€‰106 EVsâ€‰mLâˆ’1 in synthetic oviductal fluid with amino acids (SOFaa) on Day 5 post-fertilisation (Perrini and Lange Consiglio 2018 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 30, 658-671). Grade 1 blastocysts (B7) were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for genomic study. These embryos were obtained from three replicates. Inâ€‰vivo embryos were obtained from three cows superovulated by Folltropin and inseminated by the same cryopreserved semen. After flushing, only B7 were snap frozen for genomic study. Samples for RNA isolation were obtained from 3 pools of 10 embryos each for each condition (vivo, vitro-CTR, and vitro+EVs). Total RNA was isolated by a NucleoSpin1 miRNA kit. Concentration and quality of RNA were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation kits (Illumina). Differential expression analyses between samples were run with the Bioconductor edgeR package (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). MicroRNA cluster analysis was performed with Genesis. The average quantity of total RNA extracted from each pool was 3.5â€‰ng. Our results show that the miRNAs identified were 1.74E5, 2.3E5, and 3.6E5 for vivo, vitro-CTR, and vitro+EVs, respectively. Principal component analysis calculated on differentially expressed miRNAs showed a separation of the three groups with a distinctive miRNA trait. The miRNAs differentially expressed among three comparisons (vivo vs. vitro-CTR, vivo vs. vitro+EVs, and vitro-CTR vs. vitro+EVs) were 20, 15, and 2, respectively. Principal component 1, which explains 62.4% of the variance, clearly separates inâ€‰vivo- and inâ€‰vitro-produced embryos even if EV addition seems to ameliorate the effect of inâ€‰vitro production, and this agrees with the embryo quality and pregnancy rate after EV supplementation (Perrini and Lange Consiglio 2018 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 30, 658-671; Lange-Consiglio et al. 2019 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 31, 155). Indeed, vitro-CTR and vitro+EVs embryos differ significantly for two miRNAs (miR-130a, miR-181b) that are found to be higher in our vitro-CTR embryos compared with vitro+EV ones. The miR-181b was also found to be higher in degenerate bovine embryos compared with good blastocysts (Kropp et al. 2014 Front. Genetics 24, 91). In conclusion, this is the first study reporting the complete miRNA profiling of inâ€‰vitro blastocysts compared with those obtained inâ€‰vivo. The addition of EVs during inâ€‰vitro production seems to influence the expression of specific miRNAs involved in the success of embryo implantation.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Anna Lange-Consiglio"", ids = ""101843658""); list(name = ""Barbara Lazzari"", ids = ""3305455""); list(name = ""Flavia Pizzi"", ids = ""145043294""); list(name = ""Antonella Idda"", ids = ""8004465""); list(name = ""Fausto Cremonesi"", ids = ""120075274""); list(name = ""Emanuele Capra"", ids = ""152292079"")",,,"Reproduction, Fertility and Development",32,170-170
69d6630f4dd2ad193b0a915f4881d528e3888832,A leave-p-out based estimation of the proportion of null hypotheses,"In the multiple testing context, a challenging problem is the estimation of the proportion ï¿½0 of true-null hypotheses. A large number of estimators of this quantity rely on identifiability assumptions that either appear to be violated on real data, or may be at least relaxed. Under independence, we propose an estimator b0 based on density estimation using both histograms and cross-validation. Due to the strong connection between the false discovery rate (FDR) and ï¿½0, many multiple testing procedures (MTP) designed to control the FDR may be improved by introducing an estimator of ï¿½0. We provide an example of such an improvement (plug-in MTP) based on the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg. Asymptotic optimality results may be derived for both b0 and the resulting plug-in procedure. The latter ensures the desired asymptotic control of the FDR, while it is more powerful than the BH-procedure. Finally, we compare our estimator of ï¿½0 with other widespread estimators in a wide range of simulations. We obtain better results than other tested methods in terms of mean square error (MSE) of the proposed estimator. Finally, both asymptotic optimality results and the interest in tightly estimating ï¿½0 are confirmed (empirically) by results obtained with the plug-in MTP.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alain Celisse"", ids = ""2123723""); list(name = ""StÃ©phane Robin"", ids = ""152903517"")",6829e03aa84dbc4af8c28e0d7d0f44464b2f7036; 60f8aef7a2ae0142ca22e48a7b7729e129154e5b; 34382262d4407dbf2781acd514965b22c9350237; 691cea67ccccc9a74affe41ad6a13182b5e9b9fd; 054ec1ed66ad695cb85095dcc3be119c99a76c9b,02160e9b3dc97cd2b70987e7a4c1589be52c1f9d; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; e85e5de2455071a01e0647f21af6278806ccf7a3; 0c5a9db210b6ffed8bd4cc602041b3b71fc9a648; d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 0638934dbe67a2079beced7e2645ec8428758603; 46054429406bcb6e2a80216f0092f80016a8c579; 31781483a98cc06a227f686b86b96b9fd78a6590; f0bdeb00f73bb4528fa049bafca30edce2f2383c; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; bf29dcd92f0f6b650196c8d8351fd0ef91e7701b; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 5e3cbc2ed4388b1c56eab24706618cae6d725bd5; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; adf6e7b34fedb688d3e20def1341c2816a7c67b4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; e393c289a9c4311e3eb28369e273d52a84a013c2; 39acfbf0f43d4ef9ad00dcba51b0dbafe25686cb; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

3992ca93d10e1bd257711cd496fe156e4ef70235,Electrical Stimulation Induces Retinal MÃ¼ller Cell Proliferation and Their Progenitor Cell Potential,"Non-invasive electrical stimulation (ES) is increasingly applied to improve vision in untreatable eye conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Our previous study suggested that ES promoted retinal function and the proliferation of progenitor-like glial cells in mice with inherited photoreceptor degeneration; however, the underlying mechanism remains obscure. MÃ¼ller cells (MCs) are thought to be dormant residential progenitor cells that possess a high potential for retinal neuron repair and functional plasticity. Here, we showed that ES with a ramp waveform of 20 Hz and 300 ÂµA of current was effective at inducing mouse MC proliferation and enhancing their expression of progenitor cell markers, such as Crx (cone-rod homeobox) and Wnt7, as well as their production of trophic factors, including ciliary neurotrophic factor. RNA sequencing revealed that calcium signaling pathway activation was a key event, with a false discovery rate of 5.33 Ã— 10-8 (p = 1.78 Ã— 10-10) in ES-mediated gene profiling changes. Moreover, the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, abolished the observed effects of ES on MC proliferation and progenitor cell gene induction, supporting a central role of ES-induced Ca2+ signaling in the MC changes. Our results suggest that low-current ES may present a convenient tool for manipulating MC behavior toward neuroregeneration and repair.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sam Enayati"", ids = ""19210161""); list(name = ""Karen T.

e71dfa2f4b9e442de6b35646773a94992452ed72,Performance of Beta-Binomial SGoF Multitesting Method for Dependent Gene Expression Levels - A Simulation Study,"In a recent paper (de UÃ±a-Ãlvarez, 2012, Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology Vol. 11, Iss. 3, Article 14) a correction of SGoF multitesting method for possibly dependent tests was introduced. This correction enhanced the field of applications of SGoF methodology, initially restricted to the independent setting, to make decisions on which genes are differently expressed in group comparison when the gene expression levels are correlated. In this work we investigate through an intensive Monte Carlo simulation study the performance of that correction, called BB-SGoF (from Beta-Binomial), in practical settings. In the simulations, gene expression levels are correlated inside a number of blocks, while the blocks are independent. Different number of blocks, within-block correlation values, proportion of true effects, and effect levels are considered. The allocation of the true effects is taken to be random. False discovery rate, power, and conservativeness of the method with respect to the number of existing effects with p-values below the given significance threshold are computed along the Monte Carlo trials. Comparison to the classical Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment is provided. Conclusions from the simulation study and practical recommendations are reported.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Irene Castro-Conde"", ids = ""1401810536""); list(name = ""Jacobo de UÃ±a-Ã\201lvarez"", ids = ""1402163279"")",,21e6ddaea5dd700a33eca5b97ce31a9bedfcf88a; 9313246ef7222ad6535b54f58fb7ed7b08310994; 2c5079bcd7c00c2e3568d2a164c99778ceec2570; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; 94fb8e97839f3dd4804e94008b2a03fe2841677d; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e,,,93-97
5456bba61bcdc9a6a8673b8d1bd496c00fb2d604,Molecular mechanisms regulating bovine ovarian follicular selection.,"Transcription profiling of ovarian follicles. Understanding the mechanisms by which a single follicle is selected for further ovulation is important to control fertility in mammals. However, development of new treatments is limited by our poor understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating follicular selection. Our hypothesis is that genes involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis are differentially regulated during follicular selection. Our objective was to identify these new genes. Bovine follicles were collected and gene expression levels were measured using microarrays. First, follicles were allocated to three groups, according to the time spent from the initiation of follicular wave to surgery (24 H, 36 H, and 48-60 H). Fifty-seven genes are differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of 5%. These genes are involved in the control of lipid metabolism (P-value = 0.0005), cell proliferation (0.007), cell death (0.003), cell morphology (0.003), and immune response (0.003). Follicles were also grouped into four categories, according to the expected time of deviation (early deviation; 8 mm, mid-deviation; 8.5 mm, late deviation; 9 mm, dominant follicles; >or=10 mm). One hundred and twenty eight genes are differentially expressed between these four groups, including genes involved in cell proliferation (0.00002), cell death (0.0006), cell-to-cell signaling (0.003), cell morphology (0.003), lipid metabolism (0.0004), and immune response (0.00007). The expression levels of 10 genes were confirmed using quantitative real time PCR. As expected, we identified new differentially regulated genes involved in the control of cell growth and apoptosis. We also discovered a potential role for immune cells, and in particular macrophages, in follicular selection.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhilin Liu"", ids = ""49293052""); list(name = ""Robert Scott Youngquist"", ids = ""50788261""); list(name = ""H.

ade9c31e47da33eacb136840113caee51e3dba50,Myocardial transcriptional profiles in a murine model of sepsis: evidence for the importance of age.,"BACKGROUND
Age influences outcome of sepsis and septic shock. The mechanism of this age-dependent vulnerability to sepsis remains largely unknown. Because much of the mortality and morbidity associated with sepsis and septic shock is the result of severe derangements in the cardiovascular system, it is possible that the myocardium responds to injury in a developmentally influenced manner. We hypothesized that analysis of cardiac RNA expression profiles may differentiate between the myocardial response to sepsis in young and old mice.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Sixteen FVB/N male mice were stratified based on age. Young animals were 6 wks old, correlating to 4 to 6 human years, and aged animals were 20 months old correlating to 70 to 80 human years. Animals underwent either cecal ligation and puncture to produce polymicrobial sepsis or a sham operation. Both ventricles were excised after kill at 24 hrs. There were 53 genes that differed in RNA abundance between the four groups (false discovery rate of 0.005, p < 0.00001). Additionally, four genes were associated with an age-dependent response to sepsis: CYP2B2 (cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6), VGLL2 (vestigial like 2), and PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase). The fourth gene is an expressed sequence tag, the function of which is related to the cytochrome P450 family. These genes play roles in phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and fatty acid metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
This report describes the transcriptional response of the heart to sepsis. In addition, our findings suggest that these differences are in part age-dependent and serve as hypothesis generation.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul A.

de154cb4d78e1d46e12cc6bf6a831d1273d6d4d3,Molecular genetic study of novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma,"OBJECTIVES
Early detection and treatment of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is critical because of its rapid growth, frequent lymph-node metastasis, and poor prognosis. However, no clinically-valuable methods of early diagnosis exist, and genetic analysis of OSCCs has yielded no biomarkers.


STUDY DESIGN
We investigated the expression of genes associated with inflammation in OSCCs via a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of microarray data. Tumor and normal tissues from five patients with an OSCC were used for microarray analysis. Differentially-expressed genes, identified using permutation, local pooled error (LPE), t-tests, and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), were selected as candidate genetic markers.


RESULTS
Two groups corresponding to tissue identity were evident, implying that their differentially-expressed genes represented biological differences between tissues. Fifteen genes were identified using the Student's paired t-test (p<0.05) and the SAM, with a false discovery rate of less than 0.02. Based on gene expression, these 15 genes can be used to classify an OSCC.

bf4c8bc8ddba4521eb0955707af4f28b5535658e,Empirical Bayes screening of many p-values with applications to microarray studies,"MOTIVATION
Statistical tests for the detection of differentially expressed genes lead to a large collection of p-values one for each gene comparison. Without any further adjustment, these p-values may lead to a large number of false positives, simply because the number of genes to be tested is huge, which might mean wastage of laboratory resources. To account for multiple hypotheses, these p-values are typically adjusted using a single step method or a step-down method in order to achieve an overall control of the error rate (the so-called familywise error rate). In many applications, this may lead to an overly conservative strategy leading to too few genes being flagged.


RESULTS
In this paper we introduce a novel empirical Bayes screening (EBS) technique to inspect a large number of p-values in an effort to detect additional positive cases. In effect, each case borrows strength from an overall picture of the alternative hypotheses computed from all the p-values, while the entire procedure is calibrated by a step-down method so that the familywise error rate at the complete null hypothesis is still controlled. It is shown that the EBS has substantially higher sensitivity than the standard step-down approach for multiple comparison at the cost of a modest increase in the false discovery rate (FDR). The EBS procedure also compares favorably when compared with existing FDR control procedures for multiple testing. The EBS procedure is particularly useful in situations where it is important to identify all possible potentially positive cases which can be subjected to further confirmatory testing in order to eliminate the false positives. We illustrated this screening procedure using a data set on human colorectal cancer where we show that the EBS method detected additional genes related to colon cancer that were missed by other methods. This novel empirical Bayes procedure is advantageous over our earlier proposed empirical Bayes adjustments due to the following reasons: (i) it offers an automatic screening of the p-values the user may obtain from a univariate (i.e., gene by gene) analysis package making it extremely easy to use for a non-statistician, (ii) since it applies to the p-values, the tests do not have to be t-tests; in particular they could be F-tests which might arise in certain ANOVA formulations with expression data or even nonparametric tests, (iii) the empirical Bayes adjustment uses nonparametric function estimation techniques to estimate the marginal density of the transformed p-values rather than using a parametric model for the prior distribution and is therefore robust against model mis-specification.

3f0cb20cc193b09b46b58365db34b67150d8abfc,Empirical Bayes false coverage rate controlling confidence intervals,"Summary.â€‚ Benjamini and Yekutieli suggested that it is important to account for multiplicity correction for confidence intervals when only some of the selected intervals are reported. They introduced the concept of the false coverage rate (FCR) for confidence intervals which is parallel to the concept of the false discovery rate in the multiple-hypothesis testing problem and they developed confidence intervals for selected parameters which control the FCR. Their approach requires the FCR to be controlled in the frequentist's sense, i.e. controlled for all the possible unknown parameters. In modern applications, the number of parameters could be large, as large as tens of thousands or even more, as in microarray experiments. We propose a less conservative criterion, the Bayes FCR, and study confidence intervals controlling it for a class of distributions. The Bayes FCR refers to the average FCR with respect to a distribution of parameters. Under such a criterion, we propose some confidence intervals, which, by some analytic and numerical calculations, are demonstrated to have the Bayes FCR controlled at level q for a class of prior distributions, including mixtures of normal distributions and zero, where the mixing probability is unknown. The confidence intervals are shrinkage-type procedures which are more efficient for the Î¸is that have a sparsity structure, which is a common feature of microarray data. More importantly, the centre of the proposed shrinkage intervals reduces much of the bias due to selection. Consequently, the proposed empirical Bayes intervals are always shorter in average length than the intervals of Benjamini and Yekutieli and can be only 50% or 60% as long in some cases. We apply these procedures to the data of Choe and colleagues and obtain similar results.",2012,Mathematics; Engineering,"list(name = ""Zhigen Zhao"", ids = ""2941525""); list(name = ""J. T.

fc2aa1d8202156e250095613081790e2fb6fb794,MethylQuant: A Tool for Sensitive Validation of Enzyme-Mediated Protein Methylation Sites from Heavy-Methyl SILAC Data.,"The study of post-translational methylation is hampered by the fact that large-scale LC-MS/MS experiments produce high methylpeptide false discovery rates (FDRs). The use of heavy-methyl stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (heavy-methyl SILAC) can drastically reduce these FDRs; however, this approach is limited by a lack of heavy-methyl SILAC compatible software. To fill this gap, we recently developed MethylQuant. Here, using an updated version of MethylQuant, we demonstrate its methylpeptide validation and quantification capabilities and provide guidelines for its best use. Using reference heavy-methyl SILAC data sets, we show that MethylQuant predicts with statistical significance the true or false positive status of methylpeptides in samples of varying complexity, degree of methylpeptide enrichment, and heavy to light mixing ratios. We introduce methylpeptide confidence indicators, MethylQuant Confidence and MethylQuant Score, and demonstrate their strong performance in complex samples characterized by a lack of methylpeptide enrichment. For these challenging data sets, MethylQuant identifies 882 of 1165 true positive methylpeptide spectrum matches (i.e., >75% sensitivity) at high specificity (<2% FDR) and achieves near-perfect specificity at 41% sensitivity. We also demonstrate that MethylQuant produces high accuracy relative quantification data that are tolerant of interference from coeluting peptide ions. Together MethylQuant's capabilities provide a path toward routine, accurate characterizations of the methylproteome using heavy-methyl SILAC.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aidan P Tay"", ids = ""4026408""); list(name = ""Vincent Geoghegan"", ids = ""49999269""); list(name = ""Daniel Yagoub"", ids = ""4589280""); list(name = ""Marc R.

We explored the consistency of blood transcriptomic biomarkers in HD based on a novel Slovene patient cohort and expert review of previous studies. HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip microarrays were performed on the whole blood samples of a cohort of 23 HD mutation carriers and 23 controls to identify differentially expressed (DE) transcripts. In addition, we performed an expert review of DE transcripts identified in comparable HD studies from whole blood, to identify any consistent signature of HD. In the Slovene cohort, we identified 740 DE transcripts (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01 and a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.1) of which 414 were downregulated and 326 were upregulated. Pathway analyses of DE transcripts showed enrichment for pathways involved in systemic, rather than neural processes in HD. With an expert review of comparable studies, we have further identified 15 DE transcripts shared by 3 studies.

However, the knowledge on the impact on plants under extremely high irradiance is limited. We present the first in-depth proteomics analysis of plants treated with a method developed by our research group to generate a light gradient using an extremely intense light.MethodsThe method consists of utilizing light emitting diodes (LED) to create a single spot at 24,000â€‰Î¼molâ€‰mâˆ’â€‰2â€‰sâˆ’â€‰1 irradiance, generating three light stress levels. A light map and temperature profile were obtained during the light experiment. The proteins expressed in the treated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, Heinz H1706) leaves were harvested 10â€‰days after the treatment, allowing for the detection of proteins involved in a long-term recovery. A multiplex labeled proteomics method (iTRAQ) was analyzed by LC-MS/MS.ResultsA total of 3994 proteins were identified at 1% false discovery rate and matched additional quality filters. Hierarchical clustering analysis resulted in four types of patterns related to the protein expression, with one being directly linked to the increased LED irradiation. A total of 37 proteins were found unique to the least damaged leaf zone, while the medium damaged zone had 372 proteins, and the severely damaged presented unique 1003 proteins. Oxygen evolving complex and PSII complex proteins (PsbH, PsbS, PsbR and Psb28) were found to be abundant in the most damaged leaf zone. This leaf zone presented a protein involved in the salicylic acid response, while it was not abundant in the other leaf zones. The mRNA level of PsbR was significantly lower (1-fold) compared the control in the most damaged zone of the leaf, while Psb28 and PsbH were lower (1-fold) in the less damaged leaf zones. PsbS mRNA abundance in all leaf zones tested presented no statistically significant change from the control.ConclusionsWe present the first characterization of the proteome changes caused by an extreme level of high-light intensity (24,000â€‰Î¼molâ€‰mâˆ’â€‰2â€‰sâˆ’â€‰1).

98ab07d7cf553e8f8fd026dfc3b116cdfecbb99c,Ileal Transcriptome Profiles of Japanese Quail Divergent in Phosphorus Utilization.,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential component for all living beings. Low P diets prompt phenotypic and molecular adaptations to maintain P homeostasis and increase P utilization (PU). Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of PU is needed to enable targeted approaches to improve PU efficiency and thus lower P excretion in animal husbandry. In a previous population study, Japanese quail were subjected to a low P diet lacking mineral P and exogenous phytase. Individual PU was determined based on total P intake and excretion. A subset of 20 extreme siblings discordant for PU was selected to retrieve gene expression patterns of ileum (n = 10 per PU group). Sequencing reads have been successfully mapped to the current Coturnix japonica reference genome with an average mapping rate of 86%. In total, 640 genes were found to be differentially abundant between the low and high PU groups (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05). Transcriptional patterns suggest a link between improved PU and mitochondrial energy metabolism, accelerated cell proliferation of enterocytes, and gut integrity. In assessing indicators of the efficient use of macro- and micronutrients, further research on turnover and proliferation rates of intestinal cells could provide an approach to improve P efficiency in poultry species.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Oster"", ids = ""46718159""); list(name = ""Henry Reyer"", ids = ""35001272""); list(name = ""Nares Trakooljul"", ids = ""5752711""); list(name = ""Frank M.

8588cbf91a66961aeec4df1ae42f8d9979b19185,Aerosol from Tobacco Heating System 2.2 has reduced impact on mouse heart gene expression compared with cigarette smoke.,"Experimental studies clearly demonstrate a causal effect of cigarette smoking on cardiovascular disease. To reduce the individual risk and population harm caused by smoking, alternative products to cigarettes are being developed. We recently reported on an apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mouse inhalation study that compared the effects of exposure to aerosol from a candidate modified risk tobacco product, Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS2.2), and smoke from the reference cigarette (3R4F) on pulmonary and vascular biology. Here, we applied a transcriptomics approach to evaluate the impact of the exposure to 3R4F smoke and THS2.2 aerosol on heart tissues from the same cohort of mice. The systems response profiles demonstrated that 3R4F smoke exposure led to time-dependent transcriptomics changes (False Discovery Rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.05; 44 differentially expressed genes at 3-months; 491Â at 8-months). Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the heart tissue indicated that 3R4F exposure induced the downregulation of genes involved in cytoskeleton organization and the contractile function of the heart, notably genes that encode beta actin (Actb), actinin alpha 4 (Actn4), and filamin C (Flnc). This was accompanied by the downregulation of genes related to the inflammatory response. None of these effects were observed in the group exposed to THS2.2 aerosol.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Justyna Szostak"", ids = ""40299726""); list(name = ""StÃ©phanie BouÃ©"", ids = ""2725789""); list(name = ""Marja Talikka"", ids = ""1836161""); list(name = ""Emmanuel Guedj"", ids = ""3563024""); list(name = ""Florian Martin"", ids = ""40236386""); list(name = ""Blaine W.

f2f382bea9b58fd52b228e4619514471f80f0aef,"Metabolic, pathologic, and genetic analysis of prostate tissues: quantitative evaluation of histopathologic and mRNA integrity after HR-MAS spectroscopy.","The impact of high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) spectroscopy on the histopathologic and mRNA integrity of human prostate tissues was evaluated. Forty prostate tissues were harvested at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy (nâ€‰=â€‰20) or radical prostatectomy surgery (nâ€‰=â€‰20), snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80Â°C until use. Twenty-one samples (nâ€‰=â€‰11 biopsy, nâ€‰=â€‰10 surgical) underwent HR-MAS spectroscopy prior to histopathologic and cDNA microarray analysis, while 19 control samples (nâ€‰=â€‰9 biopsy, nâ€‰=â€‰10 surgical) underwent only histopathologic and microarray analysis. Frozen tissues were sectioned at 14-Âµm intervals and placed on individual histopathology slides. Every 8th slide was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and used to target areas of predominantly epithelial tissue on the remaining slides for mRNA integrity and cDNA microarray analysis. Histopathologic integrity was graded from 1 (best) to 5 (worst) by two 'blinded' pathologists. Histopathologic integrity scores were not significantly different for post-surgical tissues (HR-MAS vs controls); however, one pathologist's scores were significantly lower for biopsy tissues following HR-MAS while the other pathologist's scores were not. mRNA integrity assays were performed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the electrophoretic traces were scored with an RNA integrity number (RIN) from 1 (degraded) to 10 (intact). RIN scores were not significantly different for surgical tissues, but were significantly lower for biopsy tissues following HR-MAS spectroscopy. The isolated mRNA then underwent two rounds of amplification, conversion to cDNA, coupling to Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, microarray hybridization, imaging, and analysis. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified no significantly over- or under-expressed genes, including 14 housekeeping genes, between HR-MAS and control samples of surgical and biopsy tissues (5% false discovery rate). This study demonstrates that histopathologic and genetic microarray analysis can be successfully performed on prostate surgical and biopsy tissues following HR-MAS analysis; however, biopsy tissues are more fragile than surgical tissues.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Carissa F.

What is the central question of this study? Does 14 days of live-high, train-low simulated altitude alter an individual's metabolomic/metabolic profile? What is the main finding and its importance? This study demonstrated that âˆ¼200 h of moderate simulated altitude exposure resulted in greater variance in measured metabolites between subject than within subject, which indicates individual variability during the adaptive phase to altitude exposure. In addition, metabolomics results indicate that altitude alters multiple metabolic pathways, and the time course of these pathways is different over 14 days of altitude exposure. These findings support previous literature and provide new information on the acute adaptation response to altitude.


ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of 14 days of normobaric hypoxic simulated altitude exposure at 3000Â m on the human plasma metabolomic profile. For 14 days, 10 well-trained endurance runners (six men and four women; 29Â Â±Â 7Â years of age) lived at 3000Â m simulated altitude, accumulating 196.4Â Â±Â 25.6 h of hypoxic exposure, and trained at âˆ¼600Â m. Resting plasma samples were collected at baseline and on daysÂ 3 and 14 of altitude exposure and stored at -80Â°C. Plasma samples were analysed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry to construct a metabolite profile of altitude exposure. Mass spectrometry of plasma identified 36 metabolites, of which eight were statistically significant (false discovery rate probability 0.1) from baseline to either day 3 or day 14. Specifically, changes in plasma metabolites relating to amino acid metabolism (tyrosine and proline), glycolysis (adenosine) and purine metabolism (adenosine) were observed during altitude exposure. Principal component canonical variate analysis showed significant discrimination between group means (PÂ <Â 0.05), with canonical variateÂ 1 describing a non-linear recovery trajectory from baseline to dayÂ 3 and then back to baseline by dayÂ 14. Conversely, canonical variateÂ 2 described a weaker non-recovery trajectory and increase from baseline to dayÂ 3, with a further increase from dayÂ 3 to 14. The present study demonstrates that metabolomics can be a useful tool to monitor metabolic changes associated with altitude exposure. Furthermore, it is apparent that altitude exposure alters multiple metabolic pathways, and the time course of these changes is different over 14Â days of altitude exposure.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nathan G Lawler"", ids = ""15562636""); list(name = ""Chris R.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe complication of cardiopulmonary bypass-deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) surgery. Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as key players in kidney physiology and pathology. However, whether they are implicated in DHCA-induced AKI at the early stage post-surgery is less studied, and requires for further investigation.


METHODS
In this study, kidney tissues were removed at 2 h post-surgery from Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent a 60-min DHCA (18Â°C), with samples from sham-operated rats as control. Renal RNA isolates were analysed with Affymetrix miRNA microarray 4.0 containing 728 mature rat miRNA probes.


RESULTS
Seventy-one miRNAs were down-regulated and 4 were up-regulated in the kidneys of DHCA rats [log2 (fold change, FC) > 1, P < 0.05]. Novel differentially expressed miRNAs, such as miRNA-3068, miR-1949 and miR-3473, were identified in the injured kidney tissues. Putative target genes of the down-regulated miR-30b-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-148b-3p and miR-10a-3p were subjected to analyses of gene ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The results indicated that these miRNAs targeted a large set of genes involved in essential biological processes related to AKI pathogenesis, such as apoptotic process and response to hypoxia, as well as genes implicated in critical signalling pathways, such as chemokine, lysosome and FoxO signalling pathways (false discovery rate-corrected, P < 0.05).

The identified 75 differentially expressed miRNAs hold the potential to serve as novel early markers and novel therapeutic targets for DHCA-AKI.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lei Yu"", ids = ""49297072""); list(name = ""Tianxiang Gu"", ids = ""1825296""); list(name = ""Enyi Shi"", ids = ""2451682""); list(name = ""Yongchao Wang"", ids = ""39150652""); list(name = ""Qin Fang"", ids = ""145294146""); list(name = ""Chun Wang"", ids = ""47074423"")",32ffd077e2f2a12b8b3b1600ee27da5d48db38af; 9b87b061e773f2ad6d0c82c2b8e57a3e1e60e740; fe1516e41dd2d8ab8f8596a3f55dd163087da47b; 0a976095a5a6d8a6cd4c0def1c7adec3ed8f71a7; cff715a67aa0847d8d333969ca54594367041464; 17bbe4c8c418a6640d4f79ee14cdd15608fe0132; 1c84b64b63dec3aa1d73849c9dbb3586d320c7e8,e1b147c7ca7a4ce5b9f23f5922e2bfbbd3ae5483; 340a21ee6fe33f2f163512b165109ff34edec7a2; 992d81c81f7786d2e2c89d0b82737892ffe76707; 16a1f5cbf3ed7f75052bd2532f25d5bb2bfb3ad2; 98cf53950d86bcbce5d7402756d0fca8cb42f0b7; 4f899438cd26238091e27b9442052b7a57276849; 5d42ce31a0378e032e70390c20d469a24711e1ac; b0fb5bf557259d403fb72f1e5b19048c93e4c228; 702b6a3a925ecc2e52c1144712ad4efa74f163c4; e918a6be0f640c1dab083d5a064f600da94e414c; 9290720d79ee58e9f0680ce7abff6eaa91b3107d; 0e7613b6d433f7c0f77a91d7a3710ce45285bbaa; e7f70b4734a1de21ae03321df134d02cc771ef17; 943d2180552dd9940df9db144089670f28d716e8; 4991719503dade152cf7a74fe26995c2bd5a2740; 27ab9c8f394be8f00719d669d522593a682ba61a; a284ab90ff71eb2c92694b4611605be58e0a8390; 4930e9967693cc537f6533ce4b724ed6e8078b02; 02d9f517980e9b97d6de197481ea70dffeb779b1; 77910325bacffd506f5bb82a6309d07192c735bc; 99db42e62f2f66a65b9b1fcd038467fb4cededc8; f42fbba843506d5e9abfbefaaf9fefbc4e66c719; d795a0a529737edb7c6fc48d6c3cacd2e594db3b; 88957f200e4a52c34d897b223a0c340eb869788c; 4f9c0009cb7693e9485a94831eac20c80bc28036,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,49 6,"

Despite familial clustering of nephropathy and retinopathy severity in type 1 diabetes, few gene variants have been consistently associated with these outcomes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We performed an individual-based genetic association study with time to renal and retinal outcomes in 1,362 white probands with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study. Specifically, we genotyped 1,411 SNPs that capture common variations in 212 candidate genes for long-term complications and analyzed them for association with the time from DCCT baseline to event for renal and retinal outcomes using multivariate Cox proportion hazards models. To address multiple testing and assist interpretation of the results, false discovery rate q values were calculated separately for each outcome.


RESULTS
We observed association between rs17880135 in the 3' region of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and the incidence of both severe nephropathy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.62 [95% CI 1.64-4.18], P = 5.6 x 10(-5), q = 0.06) and persistent microalbuminuria (1.82 [1.29-2.57], P = 6.4 x 10(-4), q = 0.46). Sequencing and fine-mapping identified additional SOD1 variants, including rs202446, rs9974610, and rs204732, which were also associated (P < 10(-3)) with persistent microalbuminuria, whereas rs17880135 and rs17881180 were similarly associated with the development of severe nephropathy. Attempts to replicate the findings in three cross-sectional case-control studies produced equivocal results. We observed no striking differences between risk genotypes in serum SOD activity, serum SOD1 mass, or SOD1 mRNA expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines.

4420738a999d2af4e37cf298b6f93e8971cda184,Automated Lipid A Structure Assignment from Hierarchical Tandem Mass Spectrometry Data,"Infusion-based electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to multiple-stage tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) is a standard methodology for investigating lipid A structural diversity (Shaffer et al. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 18(6), 1080â€“1092, 2007). Annotation of these MSn spectra, however, has remained a manual, expert-driven process. In order to keep up with the data acquisition rates of modern instruments, we devised a computational method to annotate lipid A MSn spectra rapidly and automatically, which we refer to as hierarchical tandem mass spectrometry (HiTMS) algorithm. As a first-pass tool, HiTMS aids expert interpretation of lipid A MSn data by providing the analyst with a set of candidate structures that may then be confirmed or rejected. HiTMS deciphers the signature ions (e.g., A-, Y-, and Z-type ions) and neutral losses of MSn spectra using a species-specific library based on general prior structural knowledge of the given lipid A species under investigation. Candidates are selected by calculating the correlation between theoretical and acquired MSn spectra. At a false discovery rate of less than 0.01, HiTMS correctly assigned 85% of the structures in a library of 133 manually annotated Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida lipid A structures. Additionally, HiTMS correctly assigned 85% of the structures in a smaller library of lipid A species from Yersinia pestis demonstrating that it may be used across species.",2011,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Ying Sonia Ting"", ids = ""3654891""); list(name = ""Scott A Shaffer"", ids = ""1781515""); list(name = ""Jace W.

0e73265b4215df70da4c15bb9ea85b42ef0ad5f7,Dust mite induces multiple polar T cell axes in human skin,"BACKGROUND
House dust mite/HDM atopy patch test/APT elicits positive reactions in a high fraction of atopic dermatitis/AD and healthy individuals. Experimental systems for new-onset/chronic AD are needed to support rapid therapeutic development, particularly since animal models representing human AD are lacking. While HDM APT has been considered to simulate AD, its suitability to model AD's emerging Th2/Th22 phenotype with Th1 and Th17 components is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
To assess whether HDM APT reproduces AD.


METHODS
Positive HDM APTs (n = 15) from patients with and without AD were evaluated, using genomic and immunohistochemistry studies, against intrapersonal control skin.


RESULTS
APT lesions showed higher T cell and dendritic cell infiltrates vs.


CONTROLS
Seven hundred and forty-three up- and 326 downregulated genes were differentially expressed in HDM APT (fold change >2 and false discovery rate < 0.05), with increased expression of Th2, Th9, Th17/Th22 polar cytokines (i.e. IL-5, IL-13, IL-9, IL-17, IL-22).


CONCLUSION
While HDM caused significant Th2 skewing, it also illustrated differences in Th2 induction and barrier defects; thus, HDM APT does not fully simulate AD. Given its widespread availability and sensitization rates, HDM may potentially be a useful tool that represents select aspects of AD, psoriasis, or contact dermatitis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kamran Malik"", ids = ""152211621""); list(name = ""Benjamin Ungar"", ids = ""48462903""); list(name = ""Sandra Garcet"", ids = ""50539298""); list(name = ""Riana Dutt"", ids = ""8923553""); list(name = ""Dara L.

20bcb9e1b75a3ccd1450621aff336c340c108010,Estimating and Controlling the False Discovery Rate of the PC Algorithm Using Edge-specific P-Values,"Many causal discovery algorithms infer graphical structure from observational data. The PC algorithm in particular estimates a completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG), or an acyclic graph containing directed edges identifiable with conditional independence testing. However, few groups have investigated strategies for estimating and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of the edges in the CPDAG. In this article, we introduce PC with p-values (PC-p), a fast algorithm that robustly computes edge-specific p-values and then estimates and controls the FDR across the edges. PC-p specifically uses the p-values returned by many conditional independence (CI) tests to upper bound the p-values of more complex edge-specific hypothesis tests. The algorithm then estimates and controls the FDR using the bounded p-values and the Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR procedure. Modifications to the original PC algorithm also help PC-p accurately compute the upper bounds despite non-zero Type II error rates. Experiments show that PC-p yields more accurate FDR estimation and control across the edges in a variety of CPDAGs compared to alternative methods.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Eric V.

773853c1bca5202c53e99b9465a931d1478d30ab,A robust grey wolf-based deep learning for brain tumour detection in MR images.,"In recent times, the detection of brain tumours has become more common. Generally, a brain tumour is an abnormal mass of tissue where the cells grow uncontrollably and are apparently unregulated by the mechanisms that control cells. A number of techniques have been developed thus far; however, the time needed in a detecting brain tumour is still a challenge in the field of image processing. This article proposes a new accurate detection model. The model includes certain processes such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Particularly, two extreme processes such as contrast enhancement and skull stripping are processed under the initial phase. In the segmentation process, we used the fuzzy means clustering (FCM) algorithm. Both the grey co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) as well as the grey-level run-length matrix (GRLM) features were extracted in the feature extraction phase. Moreover, this paper uses a deep belief network (DBN) for classification. The optimized DBN concept is used here, for which grey wolf optimisation (GWO) is used. The proposed model is termed the GW-DBN model. The proposed model compares its performance over other conventional methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, negative predictive value (NPV), the F1Score and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR) and false discovery rate (FDR), and proves the superiority of the proposed work.",2019,Medicine; Engineering,"list(name = ""A.

81d31cf30b90d5c2a0001f0c2cbe4fe50d3925c0,Molecular signatures generated with RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens differentiate metastatic and non-metastatic primary colorectal cancer.,"3615 Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) can be either non-metastatic (locally-advanced) or metastatic, with the latter having a considerably worse prognosis. Because tissue from patients is generally available only as FFPE specimens, we investigated whether distinct molecular signatures could be obtained for these CRC types using RNA isolated from archival FFPE specimen blocks in gene expression arrays.


METHODS
FFPE specimens were available from 12 non-metastatic tumors and 9 primary tumors along with their matching metastases. Up to 5 10-micron sections of each were microdissected to isolate areas of tumor tissue. RNA was extracted using a proprietary procedure of Response Genetics, Inc. and was then amplified and labeled. The resulting cRNA was hybridized to the U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip. Unsupervised PCA analysis of the samples resulted in the first principal component separating 2 distinct groups, which consisted of the non-metastatic and metastatic tumors. A differentially expressed gene list between metastatic and non-metastatic CRC was determined. These data were also analyzed for differential canonical pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.


RESULTS
Hierarchical clustering analysis segregated locally advanced primary tumors and metastatic primary tumors into two clusters with distinct gene signatures. A T-test with unequal variance assumption identified 609 differentially expressed probe sets with FDR (false discovery rate) = 0.05. Comparison of primary tumors with their liver metastases using a paired T-test showed only 2 differentially expressed genes at FDR = 0.05 but 526 genes with significance p value < 0.005. Pathway analysis showed significant deregulation of VEGF, hypoxia, B Cell receptor, PI3K/AKT, ERK/MAPK and G-protein coupled receptor signaling between locally advanced and metastatic tumors. Pathway analysis of primary tumors and metastases showed deregulated TGF-b, integrin and chemokine signaling pathways.


CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated the feasibility of identifying metastatic and non-metastatic tumors by microarray analysis using FFPE CRC tissue. This result is currently being validated in a separate larger cohort of patients.

ec5bdd703220385ba32bbeb466c632461577899b,Error rates for multivariate outlier detection,"Multivariate outlier identification requires the choice of reliable cut-off points for the robust distances that measure the discrepancy from the fit provided by high-breakdown estimators of location and scatter. Multiplicity issues affect the identification of the appropriate cut-off points. It is described how a careful choice of the error rate which is controlled during the outlier detection process can yield a good compromise between high power and low swamping, when alternatives to the Family Wise Error Rate are considered.

For approaches that analyze the local differences voxel-wisely, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), deformation-based morphometry (DBM) and tensor-based morphometry (TBM) have been proposed [1, 7, 2]. In these methods, the local measure of brain tissue for a voxel is quantified. In VMB, the probability of certain tissue such as gray matter is used as a gray matter density that quantifies local integrity of gray matter of a corresponding voxel. In TBM, the local volume is quantified as Jacobian determinant of deformation vector field that deforms the template volume to an individual volume. Then the difference of local measures at each voxel usually is tested by a general linear model (GLM) while the family-wise error rate is controlled by statistical techniques such as false discovery rate (FDR) or random field theory (RFT).",2011,,"list(name = ""Seung-Goo Kim"", ids = ""2007869"")",,50451ddb5aa62c51827b4cba6964a8d23003902e; b4ce02e34f06e3084d034b016443c210a7c2f2c9; c5730ba28c549b205a69a4d2c241867ea2260e05; 053e37b37d16049e686827986eaad4459b493452; 0af9854841b73f7413a7eae5ba6b5a97c9788d8f; afac4b1501e13e524093b3fbff5ea6fef4adacc7; e4e4d3fb2bdc62e3a09060253d37f8bcbf346689; e14ac3aee3a897f74dfa8f316ae9871bfc86cf1c; 6872615b0298aa01affa3b8d71e4d5547244278f; adfef66ee54eaf2c2cc6388b331ebad9520b9d59; ab51bce59de790cc33ef7fac6468bcbaac3447b8; 66b498a54843e14270b75f0c3c8fc65a0b2e1e98; 12e77f2f563d1464fa299e066f4ef4a9673a7afb; 637769996f4d7822bb46111815b6729c4b250842; 49de87a02dc4fb4660e00b5034100ab88eb8611d; 236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda; 359e509d24ce9230ed65b2ef6c2e8db818571ff6; d5eafa2b2ba0e3b1d27e7e5dd25a55cef56597d5; c32499fa96fe7be141a7ba17da4fa493bf6489ee; 352fa54953cfe0da7f1547bc6fdc43e0e53595cd,,,

The purpose of the present study was to determine if quercetin, vitamin C and niacin supplements (Q-500 = 500 mg/d of quercetin, 125 mg/d of vitamin C and 5 mg/d of niacin; Q-1000 = 1000 mg/d of quercetin, 250 mg/d of vitamin C and 10 mg/d of niacin) would alter small-molecule metabolite profiles and serum quercetin conjugate levels in adults. Healthy adults (fifty-eight women and forty-two men; aged 40-83 years) were assigned using a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to one of three supplement groups (Q-1000, Q-500 or placebo). Overnight fasted blood samples were collected at 0, 1 and 3 months. Quercetin conjugate concentrations were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS/MS, and metabolite profiles were measured using two MS platforms (UPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight MS (TOFMS) and GC-TOFMS). Statistical procedures included partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and linear mixed model analysis with repeated measures. After accounting for age, sex and BMI, quercetin supplementation was associated with significant shifts in 163 metabolites/quercetin conjugates (false discovery rate, P<0Â·05). The top five metabolite shifts were an increase in serum guaiacol, 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoic acid, allocystathionine and two bile acids. Inflammatory and oxidative stress metabolites were not affected. PLS-DA revealed a clear separation only between the 1000 mg/d and placebo groups (Q(2)Y = 0Â·763). The quercetin conjugate, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, had the highest concentration at 3 months followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-sulphate and quercetin diglucuronide. In human subjects, long-term quercetin supplementation exerts disparate and wide-ranging metabolic effects and changes in quercetin conjugate concentrations. Metabolic shifts were apparent at the 1000 mg/d dose; further research is required to understand the health implications of these shifts.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lynn Cialdella-Kam"", ids = ""1439113539""); list(name = ""David C Nieman"", ids = ""5972652""); list(name = ""Wei Sha"", ids = ""1808336""); list(name = ""Mary Pat Meaney"", ids = ""4381971""); list(name = ""Amy M.

858d1e2b1f67e9e4897f8ffd2c5d6b4691f3fc61,Proteomic Analyses of Gingival Tissue in Patients with Aggressive Periodontitis,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to establish changes in protein expression between gingival tissues samples in healthy subjects (HH, control group) and healthy sites, sites with gingivitis, periodontitis, and post treatment sites in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP, test groups). Methods: The study enrolled 8 patients, 4 with GAgP, and 4 with no signs of periodontal disease referred for crown lengthening. Gingival tissue samples in GAgP were harvested during initial periodontal treatment and sampled as healthy (PDâ‰¤3mm, BOP-), gingivitis (PDâ‰¤3mm, BOP+), periodontitis (PDâ‰¥4mm), 3 months post treatment, and in HH during surgical procedures. Tissue samples were stored in RNAlater reagent according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions until further analyses. Proteins from tissue lysate were separated by 1D gel electrophoresis, in-gel digested with trypsin, and measured by nano-scale HPLC system coupled to a mass spectrometer through a nano-electrospray ionization source. Shotgun label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify proteins. False discovery rate was set to 5%. The obtained raw data was processed by MaxQuant software. Results: The total number of identified proteins was 3420. After statistical data processing, 193 proteins showed statistically significant changes in expression levels between the control groups and test groups. Proteins that could possibly be a mark of periodontal health are: Multimerin-1, Annexins, Prolargin ; of gingivitis: Dedicator of cytokinesis protein 2, Band 3 anion transport protein ; of periodontitis: Azurocidin, Myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen, Histones, Immunoglobulins ; and of post treatment condition: Oligosaccharyltransferase complex subunit and Mimecan. The most interesting protein was Azurocidin, showing the highest fold change in periodontitis and gingivitis. Conclusion: Results showed different protein expressions in tested groups and confirmed that proteomic analyses of periodontal tissue could contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases, and might contribute to the improvements in diagnosis and prognosis of GAgP.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Ana Badovinac"", ids = ""4584847""); list(name = ""Genadij Razdorov"", ids = ""4676896""); list(name = ""Lovorka GrgureviÄ‡"", ids = ""3521232""); list(name = ""Darije PlanÄ\215ak"", ids = ""3555949""); list(name = ""Slobodan Vukicevic"", ids = ""35190995""); list(name = ""Darije BoÅ¾iÄ‡"", ids = ""90312735"")",,,,,

However, the potential expression profiling, functions and pathways of PVT1 in HCC remain unknown. PVT1 was knocked down in SMMCâ€‘7721 cells, and a miRNA microarray analysis was performed to detect the differentially expressed miRNAs. Twelve target prediction algorithms were used to predict the underlying targets of these differentially expressed miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the underlying functions, pathways and networks of the targeted genes. Furthermore, the relationship between PVT1 and the clinical parameters in HCC was confirmed based on the original data in the TCGA database. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, the top two upregulated and downregulated miRNAs were selected for further analysis based on the false discovery rate (FDR), foldâ€‘change (FC) and Pâ€‘values. Based on the TCGA database, PVT1 was obviously highly expressed in HCC, and a statistically higher PVT1 expression was found for sex (male), ethnicity (Asian) and pathological grade (G3+G4) compared to the control groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the target genes were involved in complex cellular pathways, such as the macromolecule biosynthetic process, compound metabolic process, and transcription. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways may be correlated with the regulation of the four candidate miRNAs. The results therefore provide significant information on the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with PVT1 in HCC, and we hypothesized that PVT1 may play vital roles in HCC by regulating different miRNAs or target gene expression (particularly MAPK8) via the MAPK or Wnt signaling pathways. Thus, further investigation of the molecular mechanism of PVT1 in HCC is needed.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yu Zhang"", ids = ""144893122""); list(name = ""Wei-jia Mo"", ids = ""38000635""); list(name = ""Xiao hong Wang"", ids = ""9293682""); list(name = ""Tongtong Zhang"", ids = ""47593149""); list(name = ""Yuan Qin"", ids = ""143925686""); list(name = ""Han-Lin Wang"", ids = ""7644422""); list(name = ""Gang Chen"", ids = ""143793346""); list(name = ""Dan-ming Wei"", ids = ""23702623""); list(name = ""Yi-wu Dang"", ids = ""47392323"")",dca14d7d4aadd5aec3dc6f13edbfb2b3a9055146; 2a0071b493183eea9f56ea3deea16585641684fa; 4d4c63134aaa12d4e16f5a86fb5cb72f8d345849; a2700e5587f130e4ae2c44470abe2117e4538693; 32da27d00b8800b3a5d61ca98436e75264b60385; 50f4ca21f59248729436cff2daeca665d6f8786c; 9ceb95e4653153bbf8aa1e51090f8096ac73fb9e,9c81e8756430deef93e14accab3d887f8fe496a5; b2f25bcd4b2247f79dc6dd36c5b0289c904ad87a; 3e24ff6f5f8eba407effc09a3e23ee583d4ee0e7; e352a8c8c5f79bea1ba74dbe801c458535c2004d; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; 231be65e77b73a3b1e554b19a8bde6bda751d488; 7d0ee7d1e348cef6fdd6b63f4fbd8de5303f6ec9; bb54ad6aa46a09c4819550b4f3d504bc7cf8092f; 128a58c19de6c2cb2104d19390bb90e7e1b25d67; ac7e5ab4384fc4d10c601f8b6799eb7d8dfb9c14; 5b8f7bec0a83e45d9fff4f2775486f668bc37f9e; ee0dd3a6ece610a1842692aba9e7ef863bc314db; fd98d17e8af3afe30ea399a78d45d681ace187da; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 1627f97fbdde98510add15bd6f68d78bb654c45f; 88fca4c2836631c8d32ea32a9889530d506e6b6b; 78347fcef2652962c262b79d0e61fc3e690efd8d; 8ea4f41679782316d9ffe4fb00479e6594cdbd8a; a0bf5da9841f6d150dcc21c1f5de45071ff8b29c; 4298b6c244558cc662f7384a7e0cb29b5895365b; 0d2c411828a738b2909eb3171672f76dd23eab62; 143bacfdee99ae0c7fcf9c9e50c29a1826798581; ad6a41ca203783675780130027d0f1ba2d3a275f; 3908f7bff8fa8afec329820495d3e13a6fdb16b0; cd0b903d56df5fadd28f444e46d45f428be8a417; 1a3163f721944328bdd9d4f07831a35585e7535d; 5930440ec05116267538da47a6d975e42f649714; fc1d34fe7b4833a22fff1659c0a94e392a019637; 3a47f36a51b35e76ab5d5241949d8a2da809a561; 9f5ae6b9cfc54a946bf324acd5e6656b1d725a7d; bc5fcf763268fe2cd7b202eba8fa7a2e97696616; f2f71faacb15390db44809eadb07c246806c4a0a; ebe3492f7e3ae79f65ff4afcd5a711b9c8fe5259; 67acbadb2ec2049acbf921430816014ba6df2385; bee045d6c01e6306ea88dafed14bf26c381f5fe1; 62313736a3ddeca916bfc8de08cc0a11e86b06fb; f01eea597338550d43d7e38d9184c6d705c44d7e; d13862cf299cb2f5d1a6075a9c0c3761fd0e8e41; 87da9dcb66a23d32a520fb6b5d783ec3f1134e86; 28ad8e69244d45f50ff8e6041e6a28e0e2a874fd; 43c86d9024b2d7a9444c49624fbceff1837a91e8; 2f3c851447d3b6e2810fc4931fc23bdbefd57521; d31505801dcf63d62b103ecbb78e1f27fd26036f; 6ec065a08ce9962113c389e2da46ab1c15f72080; 8226c137521962fb7f2f6b6525d84d847f9e201f; 49b10dcaeb6b2df5a15b1ca69bc553d7ce140686; 960575bc77156420ca7fba44317647c1da5cf610; f7f9c1c5d49738e9d755e8beb7fe4b8cae96db5e; 1d0d117760a01ba4b29d90a405a57870ebfc2db6,Oncology Reports,40,226 - 240
29c9550f6c8b193bcc03fd3ef1e13a1a5c5c4afa,Microarray analysis of genes affected by salt stress in tomato,"Large-scale gene expression affected by salt stress was analyzed with tomato seedlings ( LycopersonÂ  esculentum Mill cv. Money Maker) by a cDNA microarray (Tom1). The significantly differentiallyÂ expressed genes (5% Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate) consisted of 1757 sequences in theÂ analyzed tissues (cotyledons + shoot tip). Genes with over 2 fold difference were selected from the listÂ and further categorized into different function and cellular processes. Tomato homologous genes forÂ the chaperone proteins, antioxidant enzymes (catalase and peroxidase), and ion transporters (Na + -Â driven multidrug efflux pump, vacuolar ATPase, and others) were induced. The ACC oxidase andÂ ethylene-responsive gene tomato homologs had higher transcript level after salt treatment. MultipleÂ members with different expression patterns were identified for the bZIP, WRKY, and MADS-boxÂ transcription regulator. Different genes in the signal transduction pathway, such as the protein kinasesÂ (Shaggy kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, ethylene receptor neverripe, and others), proteinÂ phosphatases, calmodulin, G-protein, and the N- myristoyltransferase were regulated by salt stress.Â Most of the protease and the inhibitor homologs were suppressed by salt stress. In addition, differentÂ isoforms of cytochrome P450, genes for polyamine biosynthesis (putrescine and proline) andÂ detoxification compounds (glutathione and thioredoxin), several key enzyme genes in the metabolicÂ pathways of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids, were also affected by salt treatment. ThisÂ study has provided a set of candidate genes, especially those in the regulatory machinery that can beÂ further investigated to define salt stress in tomato and other plant species.

3a1137bb6041f171eb05a0d094bf2886bc2df583,"Rejoinder: Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model","The Fisherâ€“Neymanâ€“Pearson theory of hypothesis testing was a triumph of mathematical elegance and practical utility. It was never designed, though, to handle 10,000 tests at once, and one can see contemporary statisticians struggling to develop theories appropriate to our new scientific environment. This paper is part of that effort: starting from just the two-groups model (2.1), it aims to show Bayesian and frequentist ideas merging into a practical framework for largescale simultaneous testing. False discovery rates, Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s influential contribution to modern statistical theory, is the main methodology featured in the paper, but I really was not trying to sell any specific technology as the final word. In fact, the discussants offer an attractive menu of alternatives. It is still early in the large-scale hypothesis testing story, and I expect, and hope for, major developments in both theory and practice. The central issue, as Carl Morris makes clear, is the combination of information from a collection of more or less similar sources, for example from the expression levels of different genes in a microarray study. Crucial questions revolve around the comparability and relevance of the various sources, as well as the proper choice of a null distribution. Technical issues such as the exact control of Type I errors are important as well, but, in my opinion, have played too big a role in the microarray literature. The discussions today are an appealing mixture of technical facility and big-picture thinking. They are substantial essays in their own right, and I will be able to respond here to only a few of the issues raised. I once wrote, about the jackknife, that good simple ideas are our most precious intellectual commodity. False discovery rates fall into that elite category. The two-groups model is used here to unearth the Bayesian roots of Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s originally frequentist construction.

8aa51e77db2b7de20e723dfca00dce068a4f1dac,A Microbial Signature of Psychological Distress in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Objective Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is associated with alterations along the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Previous studies have suggested a parallel segregation of microbial features and psychological burden in IBS. This study aimed at exploring the microbial correlates of psychological distress in patients with IBS. Methods Forty-eight patients with IBS (Rome III criteria, M (SD) age = 42 (15) years, 35 female, 25 diarrhea-dominant, 5 constipation-dominant, and 18 alternating-type IBS) were assessed for psychological and clinical variables with validated questionnaires, fecal samples underwent microbial 16S rRNA analyses (regions V1â€“2). Microbial analyses comprised examination of alpha and beta diversity, correlational analyses of bacterial abundance and comparisons among subgroups defined by thresholds of psychological and IBS symptom variables, and machine learning to identify bacterial patterns corresponding with psychological distress. Results Thirty-one patients (65%) showed elevated psychological distress, 22 (31%) anxiety, and 10 depression (21%). Microbial beta diversity was significantly associated with distress and depression (q = .036 each, q values are p values false discovery rateâ€“corrected for multiple testing). Depression was negatively associated with Lachnospiraceae abundance (Spearman's &rgr; = âˆ’0.58, q = .018). Patients exceeding thresholds of distress, anxiety, depression, and stress perception showed significantly higher abundances of Proteobacteria (q = .020â€“.036). Patients with anxiety were characterized by elevated Bacteroidaceae (q = .036). A signature of 148 unclassified species accounting for 3.9% of total bacterial abundance co-varied systematically with the presence of psychological distress. Conclusions Psychological variables significantly segregated gut microbial features, underscoring the role of brain-gut-microbiota interaction in IBS. A microbial signature corresponding with psychological distress was identified.

Our objective was to compare protein profiles of cerebrospinal fluid between control animals and those subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass after moderate versus deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with selective cerebral perfusion.


METHODS
Immature Yorkshire piglets were assigned to one of four study groups: (1) deep hypothermic circulatory arrest at 18 degrees C, (2) deep hypothermic circulatory arrest at 18 degrees C with selective cerebral perfusion, (3) moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest at 25 degrees C with selective cerebral perfusion, or (4) age-matched control animals without surgery. Animals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were cooled to their assigned group temperature and exposed to 1 hour of hypothermic circulatory arrest. After arrest, animals were rewarmed, weaned off bypass, and allowed to recover for 4 hours. Cerebrospinal fluid collected from surgical animals after the recovery period was compared with cerebrospinal fluid from controls by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Protein spectra were analyzed for differences between groups by Mann-Whitney U test and false discovery rate analysis.


RESULTS
Baseline and postbypass physiologic parameters were similar in all surgical groups. A total of 194 protein peaks were detected. Compared with controls, groups 1, 2, and 3 had 64, 100, and 13 peaks that were significantly different, respectively (P < .05). Three of these peaks were present in all three groups. Cerebrospinal fluid protein profiles in animals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (group 3) were more similar to controls than either of the groups subjected to deep hypothermia.


CONCLUSIONS
The mass spectra of cerebrospinal fluid proteins are altered in piglets exposed to cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest. Moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest (25 degrees C) with selective cerebral perfusion compared with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (18 degrees C) is associated with fewer changes in cerebrospinal fluid proteins, when compared with nonbypass controls.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Taslim Allibhai"", ids = ""14681767""); list(name = ""Robert DiGeronimo"", ids = ""4696780""); list(name = ""John C.

d31c634f8215cf19ac0b1a72f28ce40e71561add,A transcriptional progression model for head and neck cancer.,"PURPOSE
A genetic progression model for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) has been established and implies the presence of transcriptional dysregulation as a consequence of accumulation of genetic alterations. Although expression array data have been provided for HNSC, the timing of transcriptional dysregulation in the progression from normal mucosa to dyplastic epithelium to invasive HNSC has not been described. Here, we describe a transcriptional progression model of HNSC.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Expression arrays representing >12,000 genes and expressed sequence tags were used to examine malignant lesions (M), premalignant lesions (PM), distant, histopathologically normal mucosa from patients with premalignant or malignant lesions (MN), and normal mucosa from the upper aerodigestive tract of patients with noncancer diagnoses (N). Significance analysis of microarrays, hierarchical clustering, and principal components analysis was used to identify genes with differential expression patterns.


RESULTS
Using a false discovery rate of <5% for significance analysis of microarray, the M group revealed 965 up-regulated and 1106 down-regulated genes relative to the N group. The PM group demonstrated 108 up-regulated and 226 down-regulated genes relative to the N group, whereas the M group demonstrated only 5 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated genes relative to the PM group. Both hierarchical cluster analysis and principal components analysis revealed a consistent separation between the N, PM, and M groups, with a closer association between the PM and M groups. To provide independent validation of the microarray data, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed for a significantly up-regulated gene, integrin alpha 6, correlating well with microarray data (linear regression analysis, P < 0.0001).


CONCLUSIONS
Similarly to the genetic progression model of HNSC, this transcriptional model shows that the majority of alterations occurs before the development of malignancy and identifies key targets of transcriptional dysregulation during progression from a normal to a premalignant state and from a premalignant to a malignant state.",2003,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Patrick K.

c2422045f5848c09cf784b3e670c6c1466cddfb8,Integrative phenomics reveals insight into the structure of phenotypic diversity in budding yeast.,"To better understand the quantitative characteristics and structure of phenotypic diversity, we measured over 14,000 transcript, protein, metabolite, and morphological traits in 22 genetically diverse strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. More than 50% of all measured traits varied significantly across strains [false discovery rate (FDR) = 5%]. The structure of phenotypic correlations is complex, with 85% of all traits significantly correlated with at least one other phenotype (median = 6, maximum = 328). We show how high-dimensional molecular phenomics data sets can be leveraged to accurately predict phenotypic variation between strains, often with greater precision than afforded by DNA sequence information alone. These results provide new insights into the spectrum and structure of phenotypic diversity and the characteristics influencing the ability to accurately predict phenotypes.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel A.

ed46725dd41643b2b4b7575b5d61517446ff7082,Application of Minimally-invasive Uterine Fluid Aspiration to Identify Candidate Biomarkers of Endometrial Receptivity through a Transcriptomic Approach,"The endometrium is receptive to the embryo during a restricted window in the mid-secretory phase. My objectives were to develop a minimally-invasive endometrial sampling method for gene expression profiling, and to identify genes differentially expressed in the receptive phase. Twenty-three normo-ovulatory women underwent uterine fluid aspiration during the prereceptive (LH+2) and receptive (LH+7) phase of the same natural cycle. RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, amplified and hybridized to whole-genome microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed self-segregation of pre-receptive and receptive samples. Importantly, profiling by uterine fluid aspiration was representative of biopsy. An unpaired t-test with a false discovery rate of 0.05 and a Î” threshold of 4-fold identified 245 unique transcripts as differentially expressed in the receptive phase. NanoString analysis validated 96% of these genes. This approach will now allow us to correlate expression of these candidate biomarkers to implantation outcomes, towards the development of clinical assays predictive for endometrial receptivity.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Crystal Chan"", ids = ""46699250"")",,5e70c35da023f99bf7fec78a6aff48d9a6b71d93;

9605a996d4674b7ba450622c68a0b1d25f3ef5e3,Microarray analysis of androgenetic and senescent alopecia: comparison of gene expression shows two distinct profiles.,"Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is characterized by androgenmediated miniaturization of the hair follicle in susceptible individuals. Senescent alopecia (SA) is the diffuse scalp hair thinning that is seen with advanced age even in individuals without a family history of hair loss. Differences in follicular counts, anagen/telogen percentages, and terminal/vellus hair ratios have been reported [1]. In a pilot study, older males showed nearly a two-fold decrease in levels of androgen receptors, 5-alpha reductase 1 and 2, and aromatase compared to young males with AGA [2]. However, the concept of whether SA is a definable entity distinct from AGA remains controversial. 
 
Here, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression profiles in AGA and SA in order to characterize novel aspects of their pathology and to identify new gene targets. The three groups of men in this study were age-matched and included: Group 1-Controls had no visible hair thinning. Group 2-AGA had male pattern hair thinning that was established to have occurred prior to age 30 and Group 3-SA had diffuse hair thinning that had its onset after the age of 60. RNA from scalp biopsies was isolated from each group (N = 10, pooled) and the gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133Plus 2.0 microarrays as described [3]. Genes with fold changes of 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 were considered to be part of the expression profiles. A total of 1200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AGA and 1360 in SA were identified compared to controls. Of these, 442 genes were unique to AGA, 602 genes were unique to SA and 758 genes were common to both AGA and SA. 
 
Hair/skin development and function is the most significant physiological function altered in both AGA and SA, however, the DEGs in this category differed in the two diseases. Table 1 shows the 34 genes in this category that are differentially regulated in AGA that contribute to hair follicle development, morphology and cycling (BARX2, EGFR, INHBA, MSX2, OVOL1, KRTs, KRTAPs, RUNX3 and TIMP3). Many of these genes required for hair follicle homeostasis are significantly under expressed in AGA but not in SA compared to normal scalp tissue (Table 1 and Figure S1). Our data (Table 1 & Figure S1) showed that the Androgen Receptor (AR) is up regulated in AGA, but not in SA. Previous studies [4] have shown that genetic variability in AR is a prerequisite for the development of early-onset AGA. A novel AGA susceptibility locus has been identified at 17q21.31 [5]. In our dataset, the DEAD box polypeptide 5 (DDX5), a transcriptional regulator of AR [6] is down regulated in AGA and maps to this locus. 
 
 
 
Table 1 
 
Genes and pathways altered in Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA). 
 
 
 
The most significant pathway altered in AGA is Notch Signaling which consists of 29 genes (Table 1) including HES1, Notch2, Notch4 and PROX1 that are known to play a role in cell fate determination [7]. The down regulated genes in this pathway in AGA include CNTN1, JAG1, NOTCH2 and PSEN1 and the genes that are up regulated include DTX3, HES and NOTCH4. The expression patterns of Notch signaling pathway genes including Notch 2 and JAG1 were validated by real-time PCR (Figure S1). Jagged1 (JAG1) gene which encodes a ligand for Notch receptor maps to chromosome 20p a susceptibility locus for male-pattern baldness [8]. A reciprocal negative feedback regulation exists between Notch and AR-dependent pathways in the prostate [9]. The activation of AR and the concomitant loss of Notch signaling may be contributing factors to hair follicle miniaturization and may serve as the mechanistic link between prostate cancer and AGA. Thus, modulating the Notch signaling pathway in AGA may lead to future therapies. 
 
In contrast to AGA, the 15 genes unique to SA (Table 2) (CALML5, CCND1, COL7A1, CTGF, GLI2, KRT15, KRT2, MYC, NAB1, POU2F3, FOS, FYN, JUNB, ID2, PPARA) participate in skin and epidermal development, keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle regulation. A number of transcription (FOS, FYN, JUN, JUNB, MYC, NAB1) and growth factors (CTGF, TGFÎ±) are significantly decreased in SA. The expression patterns of c-MYC, CTGF and TGFÎ± were validated by real-time PCR in independent sets of AGA and SA scalp biopsies (Figure S2). 
 
 
 
Table 2 
 
Genes and pathways altered in Senescent Alopecia (SA). 
 
 
 
The most significant canonical pathway altered in SA is Neuregulin signaling (Table 2). Neuregulins (NRG) belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors and are ligands of the ErbB receptors. The 21 genes in this pathway that are significantly down-regulated include EGFR signaling pathway ligands (AREG, BTC, EREG, TGFÎ±), transcription factors (EGR1, FOS, JUN, MYC) and associated genes (ADAM17, HSP90AB1, ERBB2IP, PTPN11, DCN, PSEN1, ITGA2, ITGB1). The neuregulin pathway genes that are up-regulated include kinases (PDPK1, AKT2, AKT3) and apoptotic genes (BAD, RAF, SOS1). The altered expression of neuregulin pathway genes in SA was further confirmed in independent scalp biopsies by real-time PCR (Figure S2). Although the role of neuregulins are not fully understood, previous studies have shown an important role for EGFR signaling pathway in the differentiation of the hair follicle and normal hair development [10]. Recent studies have implicated neuregulin and EGF signaling pathways with longevity and lifespan. Thus, loss of these signaling pathways may contribute to hair aging and senescent alopecia.

East Asians, a population of particular susceptibility to T2D, were generally not included in previous studies. We examined the associations of plasma metabolites with risk and prevalence of T2D in 976 Chinese men and women (40â€“74Â years of age) who were participants of two prospective cohort studies and had no cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. Sixty-eight prevalent and 73 incident T2D cases were included. Non-targeted metabolomics was conducted that detected 689 metabolites with known identities and 690 unknown metabolites. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were used to evaluate the associations of standardized metabolites with diabetes risk and prevalence. We identified 36 known metabolites and 10 unknown metabolites associated with prevalent and/or incident T2D at false discovery rate <0.05. The known metabolites are involved in metabolic pathways of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, branched-chain amino acids, other amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, androgen, and bradykinin. Six metabolites showed independent associations with incident T2D: 1,5-anhydroglucitol, mannose, valine, 3-methoxytyrosine, docosapentaenoate (22:5n3), and bradykinin-hydroxy-pro(3). Each standard deviation increase in these metabolites was associated with a 40â€“150Â % change in risk of developing diabetes (30â€“80Â % after further adjustment for glucose). Risk prediction was significantly improved by adding these metabolites in addition to known T2D risk factors, including central obesity and glucose. These findings suggest that hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, and yet to be validated novel plasma metabolites may improve risk prediction and mechanistic understanding of T2D in Chinese populations.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danxia Yu"", ids = ""6116094""); list(name = ""Steven C.

f7984fbb4d8557e1eb4d6530bc0b8dd37df24c60,White matter correlates of clinical function in schizophrenia using diffusion tensor imaging,"Dear Editors: 
 
There is by now a robust body of evidence from the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) literature that structural differences likely exist in patients with schizophrenias and may be linked to some of the clinical manifestations of this illness1. DTI is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that measures localized water diffusivity reflecting the geometric properties and directionality of both axonal membrane and myelin in large white matter tracts of the brain. The most often found DTI abnormalities in the brain of patients with schizophrenia include lower prefrontal and temporal lobe FA, as well as lower FA in the anterior cingulum, arcuate and uncinate fasciculi. Far fewer studies have attempted to correlate FA changes with clinical measures2â€“4. We report on a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)5 analysis of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) differences between unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and controls. As a secondary and exploratory analysis, we also report on WM correlates of clinical measures (PANSS, SANS and Calgary depression scale) in the schizophrenia subgroup. 
 
We enrolled thirteen unmedicated subjects (mean age 37.4 years) and sixteen controls (mean age 41.1 years, no DSM-IV axis I diagnosis). Subjects and controls did not differ significantly in any demographic variables except employment status. Subjects with schizophrenia had not used medications for at least two weeks prior to scanning. Subjectsâ€™ mean PANS score was 91+/âˆ’ 17, mean SANS 47 +/âˆ’ 16 and Calgary Depression Scale mean 3.6 +/âˆ’ 3.4. Each participant had MRI scanning performed using a 3T clinical MRI scanner with a SENSE coil (Intera, Philips Medical Systems; Bothell, WA). DTI acquisition consisted of a single-shot spin echo, echo planar imaging acquisition with a parallel imaging factor of 2 and a partial Fourier factor of 80% with TR = 5 seconds, TE = 100 ms, slice thickness = 3 mm, gap = 0.3 mm, field of view (FOV) = 256mm, number of slices = 30, matrix = 112Ã—112 (interpolated to 256Ã—256). For each slice, one image was acquired with no additional diffusion weighting and six diffusion weighted images with b=1000 s/mm2 using the scheme described elsewhere6. The diffusion-weighted acquisitions were repeated three times and averaged on the scanner to improve the signal to noise ratio. DTI data was processed using FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). The resulting FA maps were processed with the standard TBSS algorithm described in detail elsewhere5. Tract localization using this skeleton was achieved using a DTI based white matter atlas7. We investigated group differences in FA between patients with schizophrenia and controls employing a voxel-wise non-parametric Brunner Munzel test, using the NPM software package (version released on October 12, 2008; http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/npm/). Voxel-wise FA differences were corrected for multiple comparisons through false discovery rate8 threshold of 1% for our primary outcome measure (FA group difference) and 5% for our secondary outcomes (FA correlation with clinical measures). 
 
Table 1 reports the results of the voxel-wise group comparison and correlations. Although this study suffers from several limitations (modest sample size, post-hoc analysis, lack of medication history) our results replicate previously published findings about FA differences in schizophrenia. In general, we found decreased diffusivity in WM tracks of the prefrontal cortex, the SLF as well as extensive and diffuse cerebellar WM, especially in the vicinity of the SCP. These results are consistent with several other studies and appear to be in part suggestive of Andreasenâ€™s proposed cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical (CCTCC) circuit for schizophrenia9. This study suggests that gross anatomical abnormalities play a role either in the pathogenesis or development of the illness. We did not, however, replicate other documented findings: most significantly the often-reported finding of decreased FA in the temporal lobe and the corpus callosum10. Finally, we report an area of significantly increased FA in the subject population corresponding to occipital projections of the corpus callosum. This is, to the best of our knowledge, a previously unreported finding.

The most popular paradigm for false positives mitigation in high-dimensional applications is via the control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Multiple testing data from neuroimaging experiments can be very large, and reduced precision storage of such data is often required. We present a method for FDR control that is applicable in cases where only p\text{-values} or test statistics (with common and known null distribution) are available, and when those p\text{-values} or test statistics are encoded in a reduced precision format. Our method is based on an empirical-Bayes paradigm where the probit transformation of the p\text{-values} (called the z\text{-scores}) are modeled as a two-component mixture of normal distributions. Due to the reduced precision of the p\text{-values} or test statistics, the usual approach for fitting mixture models may not be feasible. We instead use a binned-data technique, which can be proved to consistently estimate the z\text{-score} distribution parameters under mild correlation assumptions, as is often the case in neuroimaging data. A simulation study shows that our methodology is competitive when compared with popular alternatives, especially with data in the presence of misspecification.

After training the classifier on 21 hand-labeled expert segmentations, we created binary maps of the hippocampus for three age- and sex-matched groups: 100 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 200 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 100 elderly controls (mean age: 75.84; SD: 6.64). Hippocampal traces were converted to parametric surface meshes and a radial atrophy mapping technique was used to compute average surface models and local statistics of atrophy. Surface-based statistical maps visualized links between regional atrophy and diagnosis (MCI versus controls: P = 0.008; MCI versus AD: P = 0.001), mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores, and global and sum-of-boxes clinical dementia rating scores (CDR; all P < 0.0001, corrected). Right but not left hippocampal atrophy was associated with geriatric depression scores (P = 0.004, corrected); hippocampal atrophy was not associated with subsequent decline in MMSE and CDR scores, educational level, ApoE genotype, systolic or diastolic blood pressure measures, or homocysteine. We gradually reduced sample sizes and used false discovery rate curves to examine the method's power to detect associations with diagnosis and cognition in smaller samples. Forty subjects were sufficient to discriminate AD from normal and correlate atrophy with CDR scores; 104, 200, and 304 subjects, respectively, were required to correlate MMSE with atrophy, to distinguish MCI from normal, and MCI from AD.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan H.

8af983c7ed8a236e4c912839a668553d5e3696f4,Clinical actionability enhanced through deep targeted sequencing of solid tumors.,"BACKGROUND
Further advances of targeted cancer therapy require comprehensive in-depth profiling of somatic mutations that are present in subpopulations of tumor cells in a clinical tumor sample. However, it is unclear to what extent such intratumor heterogeneity is present and whether it may affect clinical decision-making. To study this question, we established a deep targeted sequencing platform to identify potentially actionable DNA alterations in tumor samples.


METHODS
We assayed 515 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples and matched germline DNA (475 patients) from 11 disease sites by capturing and sequencing all the exons in 201 cancer-related genes. Mutations, indels, and copy number data were reported.


RESULTS
We obtained a 1000-fold mean sequencing depth and identified 4794 nonsynonymous mutations in the samples analyzed, of which 15.2% were present at <10% allele frequency. Most of these low level mutations occurred at known oncogenic hotspots and are likely functional. Identifying low level mutations improved identification of mutations in actionable genes in 118 (24.84%) patients, among which 47 (9.8%) otherwise would have been unactionable. In addition, acquiring ultrahigh depth also ensured a low false discovery rate (<2.2%) from FFPE samples.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results were as accurate as a commercially available CLIA-compliant hotspot panel but allowed the detection of a higher number of mutations in actionable genes. Our study reveals the critical importance of acquiring and utilizing high sequencing depth in profiling clinical tumor samples and presents a very useful platform for implementing routine sequencing in a cancer care institution.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ken Chen"", ids = ""48543280""); list(name = ""Funda Meric-Bernstam"", ids = ""1397965147""); list(name = ""Hongwei Zhao"", ids = ""49453244""); list(name = ""Qingxiu Zhang"", ids = ""4522468""); list(name = ""Nader Ezzeddine"", ids = ""144279005""); list(name = ""Lin-ya Tang"", ids = ""153781459""); list(name = ""Yuan Qi"", ids = ""40612590""); list(name = ""Yong Hua Mao"", ids = ""144397494""); list(name = ""Tenghui Chen"", ids = ""2857290""); list(name = ""Zechen Chong"", ids = ""8084118""); list(name = ""Wanding Zhou"", ids = ""35077925""); list(name = ""Xiaofeng Zheng"", ids = ""145445985""); list(name = ""Amber M.

f51c4fdbe67db40da7d05e410dc59d7015ed3616,Protein binding and methylation on looping chromatin accurately predict distal regulatory interactions,"Identifying the gene targets of distal regulatory sequences is a challenging problem with the potential to illuminate the causal underpinnings of complex diseases. However, current experimental methods to map enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide are limited by their cost and complexity. We present TargetFinder, a computational method that reconstructs a cellâ€™s three-dimensional regulatory landscape from two-dimensional genomic features. TargetFinder achieves outstanding predictive accuracy across diverse cell lines with a false discovery rate up to fifteen times smaller than common heuristics, and reveals that distal regulatory interactions are characterized by distinct signatures of protein interactions and epigenetic marks on the DNA loop between an active enhancer and targeted promoter. Much of this signature is shared across cell types, shedding light on the role of chromatin organization in gene regulation and establishing TargetFinder as a method to accurately map long-range regulatory interactions using a small number of easily acquired datasets.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Sean Whalen"", ids = ""1773065""); list(name = ""Rebecca M.

It is shown that the proposed testing procedure maintains a desired false discovery rate (FDR) and false discovery proportion (FDP) under mild regularity conditions. We also provide results on the magnitudes of the signals that can be detected with high power.

11de31f99150ba8b8fe53bba43e68ed8d9298ab5,"Association of urinary metal profiles with serum uric acid: a cross-sectional study of traffic policemen in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVES
Serum uric acid (SUA) is both a strong antioxidant and one of the key risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). We aimed to investigate the associations of urinary metal profile with SUA in traffic policemen in Wuhan, China.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional study was carried out in traffic policemen.


SETTING
A seriously polluted Chinese city.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 186 traffic policemen were recruited in this study. About 56 of them worked in the logistics department and the other 130 maintained traffic order or dealt with traffic accidents on the roads. All these subjects had worked as a policeman for at least 1â€‰year.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
SUA.


RESULTS
The significantly negative association of lead with SUA was consistent between single-metal and multiple-metal models (p=0.004â€‰and p=0.020, respectively). Vanadium, chromium and tin were reversely associated with SUA levels in the single-metal models after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (all P _FDR < 0.05). One IQR increase in vanadium, chromium, tin and lead was associated with 26.9 Âµmol/L (95% CI -44.6 to -9.2; p=0.003), 27.4 Âµmol/L (95%â€‰CI -46.1 to -8.8; p=0.004), 11.2 Âµmol/L (95%â€‰CI -18.9 to -3.4; p=0.005) and 16.4 Âµmol/L (95%â€‰CI -27.6 to -5.2; p=0.004) decrease in SUA, respectively. Significant interaction between smoking and vanadium on decreased SUV was found (pfor interaction = 0.007 and p_FDR = 0.028).


CONCLUSIONS
Urinary vanadium, chromium, tin and lead were negatively associated with SUA. Vanadium and cigarette smoking jointly affected SUA levels.

0021dcbefe3bdc7a00ea347894d26cb54ca187d8,Covariate powered cross-weighted multiple testing with false discovery rate control,"Consider a large-scale multiple testing setup where we observe pairs $((P_i, X_i))_{1\leq i \leq m}$ of p-values $P_i$ and covariates $X_i$, such that $P_i \perp X_i$ under the null hypothesis. Our goal is to use the information potentially available in the covariates about heterogeneities among hypotheses to increase power compared to conventional procedures that only use the $P_i$, while still controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). To this end, we recently introduced independent hypothesis weighting (IHW), a weighted variant of the Benjamini-Hochberg method, in which the weights are chosen in a data-driven manner as a function of the covariate $X_i$. We showed empirically that IHW leads to a large power increase, while asymptotically controlling the FDR. In this paper, we provide a rigorous statistical framework for understanding IHW: its asymptotic characteristics are viewed through the lens of the conditional two-groups model, while favorable finite-sample properties are achieved by cross-weighting, a novel data-splitting approach that enables learning the weight-covariate function without overfitting. We provide results on finite sample behavior of IHW and of IHW-Bonferroni, its adaptation to the family-wise error rate (FWER). These results are valid as long as the hypotheses can be partitioned into independent folds, with arbitrary within-fold dependence. Furthermore, under full independence, we prove finite sample FDR control for IHWc, a slightly modified variant of IHW. A key implication of IHW is that hypothesis rejection in heterogeneous multiple testing setups should not proceed according to the ranking implied by the p-values; the covariate-weighted p-values instead provide a more informative ranking.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Nikolaos Ignatiadis"", ids = ""5945772""); list(name = ""W.

ccc51deeb57b96546e8dc8feb0ea12bde6ad396a,Postprandial Metabolomics Response to Various Cooking Oils in Humans.,"Lipids account for a high proportion of dietary calories, which greatly affect human health. As a result of differences in composition of fatty acid of individual cooking oils, certain biological effects of these oils may vary. This study aimed to compare postprandial metabolomic profiles of six commonly consumed cooking oils/fats. Adopting a switch-over experimental design ( n = 15), we carried out a human feeding study with six groups (control without oils, soybean oil, olive oil, palm oil, camellia oil, and tallow) and collected fasting and postprandial serum samples. The metabolomic profile was measured by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight. We observed significant differences between the control group and experimental groups for 33 serum metabolites (false discovery rate; p < 0.05), which take part in lipid digestion, fatty acid metabolism, metabolism of pyrimidines and pyrimidine nucleosides, amino acid metabolism, neurobiology, and antioxidation. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis revealed distinct metabolomics patterns between monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and saturated fatty acid oils, between soybean oil, olive oil, and palm oil, and between two MUFA-rich oils (olive and camellia oils). The present metabolomics study suggests shared and distinct metabolisms of various cooking oils/fats.",2018,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Po-Sheng Wang"", ids = ""46808494""); list(name = ""Ching-Hua Kuo"", ids = ""2141024""); list(name = ""Hsin-Chou Yang"", ids = ""1923056""); list(name = ""Yu-Jen Liang"", ids = ""3322050""); list(name = ""Ching-Jang Huang"", ids = ""1961821""); list(name = ""Lee-Yan Sheen"", ids = ""80925439""); list(name = ""Wen-Harn Pan"", ids = ""1681977"")",,4efee74939973bc17ff9bd6bd51677d1c1107df2; b537ceed835faeff3b58c87ec90de2c7f63abbba; eac124e815e39f997412fc52206ed35577693204; 14989dea824982f9eb2b1c7d10bcae348fb25058; d2860a370a0386c57fecc4eef2e43779352fa410; 26c893723c7d6b461a99c771704afbad341352a9; ef2bf797ee0e21580cb1c017e316df3b8ba45e0a; a381f9a9198095c2a79794a10f7ea4ece8340f6b; 931c9275690380cf41e1b9dfcc2f6694142ba00c; 1c40b2c0c7220fa65169e23d61c2dcd97df3ae94; e819c29e29690a98add25fbe0fa5d3f573c11c6e; aa8acb02827939cdac309a9ae589329df55e9c03; a4980a8020dd93a42d2df1dca3910a321ddd1da6; 7f054fc514afe6e1c7db794503da599597d410f7; 8fe2c5326de2c2a090de4662df7599e2d43afa4e; 26deb0b09ba24e32722862e207b1cfeff5ff2433; 3ea4f3128595fa8676d74b63a384d67e4b7b734d; 8800fe43337d0e208d4e55d0ea803db9479a1b45; 791f61822e664123580067e321964f43adc0beca; bd7eb46b953c9b97ec64f7efe1fa05483751a3b3; c629c78395512bdfdf3a069c948f5ecf53dd16ee; 62143b7b201ed158ae4d8dd333fbdd2241167723; c7adc6421341c9b295728cdd89d2f6c7e89137f3; a5fa9e0b0f6ae97272852a29df6f9cd2dee879d0; b85896e8980f2ef7eb77ed82491dac9983eac368; 54e29b4fde47098f4fc30f7f6506e0e719737ea2; a25ce76e179e8eab275d98cb6ab54d07d88382ab; 837c113d582a5e6bf147ac7c31e4da67d0f99fc0; 726263efd6ff4b786fb6c2435643a04029a4a0ea; 8b29b9e1892ecb717aedfa95e8c111b78c3e091d; 533ad25b5781884f83d0c2a3faef7b522468f70b; d832703e4d736489dd7c779c5877f198c038ef9b; 004ccc2c22c0001592ab18964dc910b132fe9e9f; 5c297ff2861a4589dd110a1c98dc548f2c10a674; 15b7e32de919cd35d999bae769659d855781ab7e; 1a827052f01ef830cbc849c71e9da99791243a5f; 86096c667d3180d514bafefa751b3fe52b05d224; c3fc9484be97df0d934c678661dc6455c07f5760; f548fcede4de1c10d1c71adb5f8c3850f87b4d69; f6561c1c2baf4fa84421c0564640b3c08108bb98; c4774361bb1cc53af6eed4c8cea30b5b541bfe86; 9271a6651b23dd591df0ca2cf1a1ecb65d37031f; be089a44cab675970bd3bac881a9c5df926c98b0; 7b2dc42e9c59bbd8e719e49e3026aeeb9b25bb5a,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,66 19,"

336a555cfcf8f4bfb60180ce48f74cb1a37a4be3,Considering dependence among genes and markers for false discovery control in eQTL mapping,"MOTIVATION
Multiple comparison adjustment is a significant and challenging statistical issue in large-scale biological studies. In previous studies, dependence among genes is largely ignored. However, such dependence may be strong for some genomic-scale studies such as genetical genomics [also called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping] in which thousands of genes are treated as quantitative traits and mapped to different genetical markers. Besides the dependence among markers, the dependence among the expression levels of genes can also have a significant impact on data analysis and interpretation.


RESULTS
In this article, we propose to consider both the mean as well as the variance of false discovery number for multiple comparison adjustment to handle dependence among hypotheses. This is achieved by developing a variance estimator for false discovery number, and using the upper bound of false discovery proportion (uFDP) for false discovery control. More importantly, we introduce a weighted version of uFDP (wuFDP) control to improve the statistical power of eQTL identification. In addition, the wuFDP approach can better control false positives than false discovery rate (FDR) and uFDP approaches when markers are in linkage disequilibrium.

9416be7e21c33566d14687c71fd06fb9135c95c0,Genome-wide analysis of genetic predisposition to Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related sex-disparities,"Background Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD is mainly considered a complex disorder with polygenic inheritance. Despite discovering many susceptibility loci, a major proportion of AD genetic variance remains to be explained. Methods We investigated the genetic architecture of AD in four publicly available independent datasets through genome-wide association, transcriptome-wide association, and gene-based analyses. To explore differences in the genetic basis of AD between males and females, analyses were performed on three samples in each dataset: males and females combined, only males, or only females. Results Our genome-wide association analyses corroborated the associations of several previously detected AD loci and revealed novel significant associations of 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a p-value of < 5E-06. In addition, 23 genes located outside the chromosome 19q13 region showed suggestive associations with AD at a false discovery rate of 0.05 in transcriptome-wide association and gene-based analyses. Most of the newly detected AD-associated SNPs and genes were sex specific, indicating sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD. Conclusions Our findings, particularly the newly discovered sex-specific genetic contributors, provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of AD and can advance our understanding of its pathogenesis.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Alireza Nazarian"", ids = ""5226014""); list(name = ""Anatoliy I.

33f3642bde43245e8d02ab8c3c918ad3c8e6807c,Expression signature in peripheral blood cells for molecular diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have a poor prognosis due to the development of locoregional recurrences, distant metastases, and second primary tumors. There is an urgent need for biomarkers that enable detection and monitoring of the disease to provide adequate therapeutic strategies. In this study, we have investigated markers in peripheral blood cells (PBC) of 28 HNSCC patients who underwent surgery by means of expression profiling. Our hypothesis is that nucleated blood cells circulate continuously, also pass the tumor, and change their expression profile in response to tumor cell factors. For comparison, we enrolled a control group of 11 patients who underwent surgery in the head and neck region for non-HNSCC reasons. A set of 2949 genes was found to be statistically different between the groups (P < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected) and the most prominently different pathways were EIF2, EIF4, and mTOR signaling. These preliminary results are promising and warrant further studies on the definitive role of PBC gene expression as a biomarker for HNSCC detection and monitoring.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Boudewijn J.

37064e54513efd383db8a45ae65992a7554a51ef,"Sharing of Very Short IBD Segments between Humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans","We analyze the sharing of very short identity by descent (IBD) segments between humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans to gain new insights into their demographic history. Short IBD segments convey information about events far back in time because the shorter IBD segments are, the older they are assumed to be. The identification of short IBD segments becomes possible through next generation sequencing (NGS), which offers high variant density and reports variants of all frequencies. However, only recently HapFABIA has been proposed as the first method for detecting very short IBD segments in NGS data. HapFABIA utilizes rare variants to identify IBD segments with a low false discovery rate. We applied HapFABIA to the 1000 Genomes Project whole genome sequencing data to identify IBD segments that are shared within and between populations. Many IBD segments have to be old since they are shared with Neandertals or Denisovans, which explains their shorter lengths compared to segments that are not shared with these ancient genomes. The Denisova genome most prominently matches IBD segments that are shared by Asians. Many of these segments were found exclusively in Asians and they are longer than segments shared between other continental populations and the Denisova genome. Therefore, we could confirm an introgression from Deniosvans into ancestors of Asians after their migration out of Africa. While Neandertal-matching IBD segments are most often shared by Asians, Europeans share a considerably higher percentage of IBD segments with Neandertals compared to other populations, too. Again, many of these Neandertal-matching IBD segments are found exclusively in Asians, whereas Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Europeans are often found in other populations, too. Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Asians or Europeans are longer than those observed in Africans. These IBD segments hint at a gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans after they left Africa. Interestingly, many Neandertal-and/or Denisova-matching IBD segments are predominantly observed in Africans â€” some of them even exclusively. IBD segments shared between Africans and Neandertals or Denisovans are strikingly short, therefore we assume that they are very old. Consequently, we conclude that DNA regions from ancestors of humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans have survived in Africans. As expected, IBD segments on chromosome X are on average longer than IBD segments on the autosomes. Neandertal-matching IBD segments on chromosome X confirm gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans outside Africa that was already found on the autosomes.

However, the relevance of this data to humans is controversial because humans lack a forestomach. We hypothesize that an understanding of early molecular changes after exposure to a carcinogen in the forestomach will provide mode-of-action information to evaluate the applicability of forestomach cancers to human cancer risk assessment. In the present study we exposed mice to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), an environmental carcinogen commonly associated with tumors of the rodent forestomach. Toxicogenomic tools were used to profile gene expression response in the forestomach. Adult Mutaâ„¢Mouse males were orally exposed to 25, 50, and 75 mgBaP/kg-body-weight/day for 28 consecutive days. The forestomach was collected three days post-exposure. DNA microarrays, real-time RT-qPCR arrays, and protein analyses were employed to characterize responses in the forestomach. Microarray results showed altered expression of 414 genes across all treatment groups (Â± 1.5 fold; false discovery rate adjusted P â‰¤ 0.05). Significant downregulation of genes associated with phase II xenobiotic metabolism and increased expression of genes implicated in antigen processing and presentation, immune response, chemotaxis, and keratinocyte differentiation were observed in treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. A systematic comparison of the differentially expressed genes in the forestomach from the present study to differentially expressed genes identified in human diseases including human gastrointestinal tract cancers using the NextBio Human Disease Atlas showed significant commonalities between the two models. Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the use of the mouse forestomach model to evaluate chemically-induced gastrointestinal carcinogenesis in humans.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sarah Labib"", ids = ""40350202""); list(name = ""C.

c170462aa4a84c85261c5b10df2543bca6559365,83 Stage-specific Proteome Signatures in Early Bovine Embryo Development,"Development of early embryonic stages before activation of the embryonic genome depends on sufficiently stored products of the maternal genome and adequate activation, deactivation, and relocation of proteins. To establish protein function, several posttranslational events (e.g. proteolytic activation, phosphorylation, or secretion) are frequently essential and thereby prevent prediction of protein abundance from transcript abundance. Consequently, proteomic studies are indispensable to characterise the molecular processes governing early embryonic development and to establish corresponding regulatory networks. Here, we present a quantitative proteome analysis of bovine zygotes and embryos at the 2-cell and 4-cell stage. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) were prepared from bovine ovaries obtained from a local abattoir and selected for a compact layer of cumulus cells. In vitro maturation, fertilization, and embryo production were performed according to standard procedures. For quantitative isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, protein from batches of 50 MII oocytes (serving as a reference), zygotes, 2-cell and 4-cell stage embryos, respectively, was extracted. Quantitative proteome analysis of iTRAQ-labelled tryptic peptides was performed on an Orbitrap XL instrument (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an Eksigent nano-liquid chromatography system (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). The tandem MS data were analysed by MASCOT and filtered for a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1%. Quantification of iTRAQ signals was accomplished with the Q+ module of the Scaffold software (Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA). t-Tests, ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA) analysis were performed using R (R Core Development Team, Vienna, Austria). From 4 biological replicates, 1072 proteins were identified and quantified. Eighty-seven differed significantly in abundance between the 4 stages (log2 fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰|0.6|, Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). The proteomes of 2-cell and 4-cell embryos differed most from the reference MII oocyte, and a considerable fraction of proteins continuously increases in abundance during the stages analysed. Bioinformatic analysis of abundance altered proteins provided evidence that the proteins RPS14 and HNRNPK involved in the p53 pathway play a major role during early development, as well as proteins of the lipid metabolism, in particular APOA1. Furthermore, a group of proteins (e.g. SPTBN1, PPP1CC, RABGAP1, STMN1, and WEE2) is engaged in mitosis. In addition, we detected relevant differences between transcript and protein abundance levels; for example, for WEE2. In conclusion, this study identified and quantified numerous proteins important for early embryogenesis so far not described in the mammalian system, and contributed protein profiles for key players previously described. Our results highlight the importance of innovative proteomic tools and workflows to complement transcriptome data of early embryogenesis.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Daniela R.

To investigate the interactive effect of plasma irbesartan concentration and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGT1R) gene polymorphisms on blood pressure (BP) response to irbesartan treatment.


METHODS
This study included 1049 Chinese hypertensive patients who were treated with daily oral 150 mg irbesartan for 4 weeks. BP at predose and 28th day of treatment and trough plasma irbesartan concentration (on 28th day of treatment) were measured. Four AGT1R gene polymorphisms (rs2640539, rs1492097, rs388915, rs5186) were genotyped. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess interactive effect of plasma irbesartan concentration and gene polymorphisms on BP response, with adjustment for covariates.


RESULTS
When stratified by genotypes, patients carrying allele C of single-neucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs5186 showed positive association between irbesartan concentration and BP response [SBP: Î² Â± SE=6.1 Â± 2.3 with false discovery rate (FDR) P=0.029; DBP: Î² Â± SE=2.7 Â± 1.0 with FDR P=0.029], but this was not seen in patients with AA genotype. There was a significant interaction between plasma irbesartan concentration and SNP rs5186 on SBP response (interaction P=0.0335) and DBP response (interaction P=0.0190). There also were significant interactions between plasma irbesartan concentration and hap3, hap5 and hap6 (constructed by four genotyped SNPs) on SBP response (FDR P<0.001), but not on DBP response.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that AGT1R gene polymorphisms and plasma concentration of irbesartan can act interactively to modulate individual response to antihypertensive therapy using irbesartan.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shan-qun Jiang"", ids = ""16074480""); list(name = ""Yi-Hsiang Hsu"", ids = ""2128747""); list(name = ""Scott A.

1bc49a88357dd8fbd1a7b62f9de16867f7f5d3ef,Meta-analysis of osteoporosis genetic studies â€“ much ado about nothing?,"Meta-analysis is an increasingly used tool in many areas of biomedical research. There are very few fields of research where there is no conflict in the published literature, or where there are unarguably definitive studies available. This is particularly the case in genetics, where, for reasons outlined elsewhere, current approaches have been plagued by high false discovery rates and inadequate power. Not surprisingly, some investigators have turned to meta-analysis to address these problems. This review examines the strengths and weaknesses of the different forms of meta-analysis, with a particular focus on their record and potential future role in osteoporosis genetics. BoneKEy-Osteovision. 2006 July;3(7):10-14. Â©2006 International Bone and Mineral Society The â€˜evidence-based medicineâ€™ movement has anointed meta-analysis of therapeutic interventions as being of higher standing than individual, large, randomized control trials (1). Is this really justified, and can this valuation be generalized to genetic studies? The record in osteoporosis genetics indicates that we should treat the findings of even large, well-performed meta-analyses with caution, as they are not immune to biases, and have not infrequently produced contradictory results. The â€˜big threeâ€™ genes which have attracted the vast majority of attention to date in osteoporosis genetics encode the vitamin D receptor (VDR), type 1 collagen alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) and the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1). Each of these has had more than one meta-analysis performed of it, with no great increase in clarity as to their role in determining BMD or fracture risk. A retrospective meta-analysis of ESR1 variants and BMD and fracture risk by Ionnadis and colleagues reported the findings of studies of 5834 women from 30 study groups (2). The study reported association of XX homozygotes (the minor allele of SNP rs9340799) with increased BMD at both the femoral neck and lumbar spine. There was no evidence of heterogeneity between studies, and publication bias checks, including inverted funnel plots and recursive cumulative metaanalysis, did not indicate the presence of any bias. Funnel plots primarily examine the relationship between study size and reported significance; cumulative metaanalysis examines whether the observed significance changes with increasing data availability (initial studies typically report the highest level of significance). A significant reduction in fracture was also observed amongst XX homozygotes (odds ratio 0.66, p=0.017). The authors concluded that future research should examine the effect of other polymorphisms, including those potentially in linkage with the rs9340799 SNP. Nonetheless, in 2004 Ionnadis and colleagues performed a prospective metaanalysis of rs9340799, rs2234693 (PvuII; also studied in the previous paper), and a dinucleotide repeat in 18,917 men and women from 8 European centers (3). The conclusion from this study was that rs9340799 affected fracture risk, but not Copyright 2006 International Bone and Mineral Society BoneKEy-Osteovision. 2006 July;3(7):10-14 http://www.bonekey-ibms.org/cgi/content/full/ibmske;3/7/10 DOI: 10.1138/20060221 11 bone density, leading to speculation that the mechanism of association with fracture was through bone size effects rather than BMC. Both these studies were of high quality, and the differences in findings are not due to methodological errors, but demonstrate that meta-analysis, particularly when performed retrospectively, is prone to error. The current consensus with regard to ESR1 and its role in adult bone density and fracture risk is that it probably plays a role in fracture risk, but whether this is through effects on bone size or on BMC is unknown. Only a small proportion of the genetic variation in ESR1 has been studied, and there is still a need for a systematic study of the gene, just as there was prior to either of these metaanalyses. A similar experience has occurred with meta-analysis of VDR. As with most genetic findings, the initial reports of strong association of VDR polymorphisms with BMD have subsequently been tempered by failure of replication, or even completely contradictory findings. The reasons for this include genotyping error, error of statistical analysis, incorrect zygosity assignment in twins, and the vagaries of chance, which play a particularly important role when studies are underpowered. Meta-analysis addresses the issue of sample size, but generally not the other sources of error. There have now been at least five metaanalyses of VDR variants, with results almost as varied as the studies they have pooled (4-8). The role of VDR genetic variation in adult BMD and fracture risk has therefore not been clarified by this approach, other than to indicate that if the gene does play a role in BMD, then the variants that have been studied have a very minor effect at most. Recent studies in very large cohorts have demonstrated no significant association of VDR polymorphisms and BMD, bone loss or fracture, confirming what most people in the field believed (9). The Sp1 polymorphism of COL1A1 (rs18000120) has been examined by both retrospective (10) and prospective metaanalysis (11), with both suggesting association with BMD at the femoral neck, and at the lumbar spine but with a smaller effect size. The retrospective analysis suggested a highly significant association with fracture (either â€˜anyâ€™ or vertebral), whereas the prospective study, although more than three times larger, showed no significant association with fracture. Strangely, neither study reported on hip fracture, the fracture of greatest interest. The prospective study is undoubtedly a â€˜gold-standardâ€™ study, and thus we must assume that the retrospective analysis suffered some form of bias causing the false positive finding with regard to fracture. This again highlights the poor reliability of retrospective meta-analysis. A key issue in retrospective meta-analysis is how comprehensively the available data has been collected. Data may be found in peerreviewed publications, abstracts, or even be unpublished. The use of non-peer reviewed data has been much debated, but surveys of authors of meta-analysis papers indicate that the majority support its use. Does publication bias affect osteoporosis genetics, or are investigators driven to publish independent of the significance of their findings? A quick survey of the abstracts submitted to the 2000 and 2001 American Society of Bone and Mineral Research Annual Scientific Meeting shows that only a minority of abstracts make it into the light of day as peer-reviewed publications. In these two years there were 18 abstracts reporting association studies of VDR gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis or fracture. Of these, only five have, to date, been published in a peer-reviewed format. As most osteoporosis genetics meta-analyses have not included abstracts, the majority of these studies would not have been included in VDR meta-analyses. We have no way of determining how much unpublished data is available, but, particularly in private industry, negative results rarely see the light of day, whereas positive results are widely promoted. The situation with other much studied osteoporosis candidate genes is similar, suggesting that the meta-analyses published to date are far from comprehensive, and thus open to bias.

It could be argued that meta-analysis has an even greater role with linkage studies than with association, given that nearly all significant linkage studies are published, and publication bias is therefore less prevalent. Methods can be divided into either approaches that utilize the actual transmission data within the families studied, and the â€˜genome-screen meta-analysisâ€™ (GSMA) approach (12). In the former method, inheritance-by-descent statistics from different scans are combined either equally (in pooled meta-analysis) or weighted taking into account the differences in size, marker density and linkage information content extracted by each screen. In GSMA, linkage results from different screens are scored in bins of fixed length along chromosomes, and for each study the maximum linkage within each bin is then used to rank the bins within each study from strongest to weakest linkage score. These ranks are then summed across studies for each bin to provide the overall linkage score. The scores can also be weighted, typically in relation to the sample size rather than marker density or characteristics of the families, both of which affect the power of each study but are ignored by this method. GSMA is less powerful than standard linkage metaanalysis (13), but is less complex to perform, and does not require studying the original linkage data, because the ranking in bins is performed using LOD scores or p-values, not the inheritance information within each family. In the authorâ€™s opinion, GSMA should not be encouraged because it is less powerful, has low resolution (because of the pooling of results into wide â€˜binsâ€™), and because of its use without obtaining the original data. In such large datasets of cases and markers, errors of marker order, genotyping errors and even changes in affection status amongst cases are not rare. Original linkage data can nearly always be obtained, and allows a further opportunity for error checking, as well as producing significant power gains. One GSMA linkage meta-analysis has been published in osteoporosis, without the authors requesting the original data (14). Linkage scores were analyzed in 30 cM bins, thus linkages occurring up to 30 cM apart were considered to have come from the same linkage â€˜signalâ€™.

3b36161112b81feeae73499bd96589dc8858ab61,Symmetric Directional False Discovery Rate Control.,"This research is motivated from the analysis of a real gene expression data that aims to identify a subset of ""interesting"" or ""significant"" genes for further studies. When we blindly applied the standard false discovery rate (FDR) methods, our biology collaborators were suspicious or confused, as the selected list of significant genes was highly unbalanced: there were ten times more under-expressed genes than the over-expressed genes. Their concerns led us to realize that the observed two-sample t-statistics were highly skewed and asymmetric, and thus the standard FDR methods might be inappropriate. To tackle this case, we propose a symmetric directional FDR control method that categorizes the genes into ""over-expressed"" and ""under-expressed"" genes, pairs ""over-expressed"" and ""under-expressed"" genes, defines the p-values for gene pairs via column permutations, and then applies the standard FDR method to select ""significant"" gene pairs instead of ""significant"" individual genes. We compare our proposed symmetric directional FDR method with the standard FDR method by applying them to simulated data and several well-known real data sets.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah E Holte"", ids = ""3458913""); list(name = ""Eva K.

Although PET-based radiomic features have been proposed to quantify tumor heterogeneity and shown promise in outcome prediction, little is known about their relationship with tumor genetics. This study assessed the association of [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET-based radiomic features with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mutations.


METHODS
348 NSCLC patients underwent FDG-PET/CT scans before treatment and were tested for genetic mutations. 13% (44/348) and 28% (96/348) patients were found to harbor EGFR (EGFR+) and KRAS (KRAS+) mutations, respectively. We evaluated nineteen PET-based radiomic features quantifying phenotypic traits, and compared them with conventional PET features (metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and maximum-SUV). The association between the feature values and mutation status was evaluated using the Wilcoxcon-rank-sum-test. The ability of each measure to predict mutations was assessed by the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Noether's test was used to determine if the AUCs were significantly from random (AUC=0.50). All p-values were corrected for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDRWilcoxon and FDRNoether ) of 10%.


RESULTS
Eight radiomic features, MTV, and maximum-SUV, were significantly associated with the EGFR mutation (FDRWilcoxon =0.01-0.10). However, KRAS+ demonstrated no significantly distinctive imaging features compared to KRAS- (FDRWilcoxon â‰¥0.92). EGFR+ and EGFR- were significantly discriminated by conventional PET features (AUC=0.61, FDRNoether =0.04 for MTV and AUC=0.64, FDRNoether =0.01 for maximum-SUV). Eight radiomic features were significantly predictive for EGFR+ compared to EGFR- (AUC=0.59-0.67, FDRNoether =0.0032-0.09). Normalized-inverse-difference-moment outperformed all features in predicting EGFR mutation (AUC=0.67, FDRNoether =0.0032). Moreover, only the radiomic feature normalized-inverse-difference-moment could significantly predict KRAS+ from EGFR+ (AUC=0.65, FDRNoether =0.05). All measures failed to predict KRAS+ from KRAS- (AUC=0.50-0.54, FDRNoether â‰¥0.92).


CONCLUSION
PET imaging features were strongly associated with EGFR mutations in NSCLC. Radiomic features have great potential in predicting EGFR mutations. Our study may help develop a non-invasive imaging biomarker for EGFR mutation.

6b33cb58e37241d9676388e8a94047ae84bd6225,From QTL Mapping to eQTL Analysis,"Genetic loci that affect mRNA expression levels of other genes are referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Discovering eQTLs by combining gene expression data with genetic marker data is an important means to understand gene regulation and to study disease mechanisms. EQTL mapping has been studied in many species, e.g., yeast [1, 2], eucalyptus [3], mice [4â€“6], rats [7], and human [8, 9]. Results from eQTL studies have been used for identifying hot spots [1, 4â€“7, 9, 54], constructing causal networks [6, 10â€“14], prioritizing lists of candidate genes for clinical traits [5, 7, 13], and elucidating subclasses of clinical phenotypes [4, 5]. Most eQTL studies are based on linear regression models [15] in which each trait variable is regressed against each marker variable. The p-value of the regression slope is reported as a measure of significance for the association. In the context of multiple traits and markers, procedures such as false discovery rate (FDR) controls [16, 17] can be used to control family-wise error rates. Despite the success of this type of regression approach, a number of challenging problems remain. First, these methods cannot easily assess the joint effect of multiple markers, i.e., epistatic effects, beyond additive effects. Storey et al. [85] developed a step-wise regression method to find eQTL pairs. This procedure, however, tends to miss eQTL pairs with small marginal effects but a strong interaction effect. Second, there are often strong correlations among expression levels for certain groups of genes, partially reflecting coregulation of genes in biological pathways that may respond to common genetic loci and environmental perturbations [2, 4, 14, 18, 19]. Previous findings of eQTL â€œhot spots,â€ i.e., loci affecting a larger number of expression traits than expected by chance, and their biological implications further enhance this notion and highlight the biological importance of finding such gene â€œmodules.â€ Mapping genetic loci for multiple traits simultaneously is more powerful than mapping single traits",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""47528349""); list(name = ""Jun S.

735b172522303bd7e574bcaae5f6c7bf2eefa14c,Effects of live yeast on differential genetic and functional attributes of rumen microbiota in beef cattle,"Several studies have evaluated the effects of live yeast supplementation on rumen microbial population; however, its effect on differential microbial genes and their functional potential has not been described. Thus, this study applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing to evaluate the effects of live yeast supplementation on genetic and functional potential of the rumen microbiota in beef cattle. Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein steers were randomly assigned to two treatments in a cross-over design with two 25-day experimental periods and a 10-day wash-out between the two periods. The steers were housed in individual pens and fed 50% concentrate-mix and 50% red clover/orchard hay ad libitum. Treatments were (1) control (CON; basal diet without additive) and (2) yeast (YEA; basal diet plus 15â€‰g/d of live yeast product). Rumen fluid samples were collected at 3, 6, and 9â€‰h after feeding on the last d of each period. Sequencing was done on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Dietary yeast supplementation increased the relative abundance of carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria (such as Ruminococcus albus, R. champanellensis, R. bromii, and R. obeum) and lactate-utilizing bacteria (such as Megasphaera elsdenii, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, and D. vulgaris). A total of 154 differentially abundant genes (DEGs) were obtained (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation analysis of the DEGs revealed that 10 pathways, including amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis, protein export, ribosome, and bacterial secretory system, were enriched in steers fed YEA. Annotation analysis of the DEGs in the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) database revealed that the abundance of genes coding for enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolases, glycosyltransferases, and carbohydrate binding modules were enriched in steers fed YEA.

304c90e350f991274a81860a59ab057dfffba712,Brain connectivity and psychiatric comorbidity in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder,"Prolonged Internet video game play may have multiple and complex effects on human cognition and brain development in both negative and positive ways. There is not currently a consensus on the principle effects of video game play neither on brain development nor on the relationship to psychiatric comorbidity. In this study, 78 adolescents with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and 73 comparison subjects without IGD, including subgroups with no other psychiatric comorbid disease, with major depressive disorder and with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), were included in a 3â€‰T resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis. The severity of Internet gaming disorder, depression, anxiety and ADHD symptoms were assessed with the Young Internet Addiction Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Korean ADHD rating scales, respectively. Patients with IGD showed an increased functional correlation between seven pairs of regions, all satisfying qâ€‰<â€‰0.05 False discovery rates in light of multiple statistical tests: left frontal eye field to dorsal anterior cingulate, left frontal eye field to right anterior insula, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), right DLPFC to right TPJ, right auditory cortex to right motor cortex, right auditory cortex to supplementary motor area and right auditory cortex to dorsal anterior cingulate. These findings may represent a training effect of extended game play and suggest a risk or predisposition in game players for over-connectivity of the default mode and executive control networks that may relate to psychiatric comorbidity.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Doug Hyun Han"", ids = ""18554383""); list(name = ""Sun Mi Kim"", ids = ""46876784""); list(name = ""Sujin Bae"", ids = ""4202907""); list(name = ""Perry F.

255f257ec525e451edc86d03926b35e9fe0b8ede,QTL Mapping Using a Memetic Algorithm with Modifications of BIC as Fitness Function,"The problem of locating quantitative trait loci (QTL) for experimental populations can be approached by multiple regression analysis. In this context variable selection using a modification of the Bayesian Information Criterion (mBIC) has been well established in the past. In this article a memetic algorithm (MA) is introduced to find the model which minimizes the selection criterion. Apart from mBIC also a second modification (mBIC2) is considered, which has the property of controlling the false discovery rate. Given the Bayesian nature of our selection criteria, we are not only interested in finding the best model, but also in computing marker posterior probabilities using all models visited by MA. In a simulation study MA (with mBIC and mBIC2) is compared with a parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) which has been previously suggested for QTL mapping. It turns out that MA in combination with mBIC2 performs best, where determining QTL positions based on marker posterior probabilities yields even better results than using the best model selected by MA. Finally we consider a real data set from the literature and show that MA can also be extended to multiple interval mapping, which potentially increases the precision with which the exact location of QTLs can be estimated.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Frommlet Florian"", ids = ""102736658""); list(name = ""Ljubic Ivana"", ids = ""102674600""); list(name = ""ArnardÃ³ttir Helga BjÃ¶rk"", ids = ""102394795""); list(name = ""Bogdan Malgorzata"", ids = ""102792561"")",80d5d822a53bc04393986552813391a30a73fbe7; 99112c99b3dc07668b3b5eccd27df398be7c60e3,,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,11,1-26
3e1360e28ccba87db3d7d6c03be082cabfe199f9,Investigating Causality Between Blood Metabolites and Emotional and Behavioral Responses to Traumatic Stress: a Mendelian Randomization Study,"To investigate the causal relationship between blood metabolites and traits related to trauma-response, we combined genome-wide and metabolome-wide datasets generated from large-scale cohorts. Five trauma-response traits ascertained in the UK Biobank (52,816 < N < 117,900 individuals) were considered: (i) â€œAvoided activities/situations because of previous stressful experienceâ€ (Avoidance); (ii) â€œFelt distant from other peopleâ€ (Distant); (iii) â€œFelt irritable/had angry outburstsâ€ (Irritable); (iv) â€œFelt very upset when reminded of stressful experienceâ€ (Upset); (v) â€œRepeated disturbing thoughts of stressful experienceâ€. These were investigated with respect to 52 blood metabolites tested in a previous genome-wide-association study (N = 24,925 European-ancestry individuals). Linkage disequilibrium score regression, polygenic risk scoring (PRS), and Mendelian randomization were applied to the datasets. We observed that 14 metabolites were genetically correlated with trauma-response traits (p < 0.05). High-resolution PRS of 4 metabolites (citrate; glycoprotein acetyls; concentration of large very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles (LVLDLP); total cholesterol in medium particles of VLDL (MVLDLC)) were associated with trauma-response traits (false discovery rate Q < 10%). These genetic associations were partially due to causal relationships (Citrateâ†’Upset Î² = âˆ’ 0.058, p = 9.1 Ã— 10-4; Glycoproteinsâ†’Avoidance Î² = 0.008, p = 0.003; LVLDLPâ†’Distant Î² = 0.008, p = 0.022; MVLDLCâ†’Avoidance Î² = 0.019, p = 3 Ã— 10-4).

75b2aa5718075b1909117d40b5155498f417f9b4,Using the partitioning principle to control generalized familywise error rate,"In multiple testing, strong control of the familywise error rate (FWER) may be unnecessarily stringent in some situations such as bioinformatic studies. An alternative is to control the false discovery rate (FDR), the expected proportion of true null hypotheses among all rejected null hypotheses. However, in bioinformatic studies, the loss or cost of false discoveries often corresponds to the number rather than the proportion of false discoveries. Controlling the generalized familywise error rate (gFWER) controls the probability of incorrectly rejecting strictly more than m hypotheses. In this dissertation, we propose the generalized partitioning principle for constructing multiple tests that control gFWER. A set of sufficient conditions to shortcut generalized partitioning tests as step-down tests is provided. We show that, by being able to use information on the joint distribution of test statistics, step-down tests we propose can be more powerful than stepdown tests that ignore such information.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Haiyan Xu"", ids = ""46485188"")",6c1f2a7cacef2efb64624b8957c83fb2eed1d458,d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; df01b02f8e4e8051fcdd14fc048002de54993857; a24b7bf40c967f357e66b00dc7d2141a6966986c; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; e5a19a6728bff0e799f3518e0fb0354e8c3cc7d3; 07eec256ef567a114f80822f224d6e045f7fbab3; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; 0514c2895a30b47b7c0449ddc87c5f6b7e4f1556; 5bb806b3b547f1e3debe5ed6ed5eb875d3fb3049; 08d23fdaeec2a46da5189cf105de238fb37bb77e; 72bda2b9be1e4bac9341ce5cc326c3235f9794e4; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 784453b76688a1f656919df6d65011ae34dfe0ad; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222; fa1792195d6967423ae1778658497f0b00351e7e; af16bc9a37a231f32beeb466d16ead03bc961b20; 0eb1af49bea0d46ccd4806fdae480f26b16fb778; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 74ec47a29e1f37fc264b3d811587b99d0047df5e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b5a78f1283160b54a9951dcc8a3d6482d54a5b51; c86900fc9f326e9861adc395c7e4be93dcdb8c2c; 0c2a1c466906e682e86c4c3f74aaa92d205faf43; 649053f9f8bca9edd12a0ed04e38c8c95fe05f0c; dd3ad136731452e8504907f43b20ccc65b19dfaf; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; a9f543f44e96d3ef4199bf52b49790314fe148d9,,,
5c1c7a1bce128fa83a724807f125594c2842dd8e,Abstract 2781: Novel putative diagnostic methylation biomarkers for prostate cancer identified by whole genome DNA methylation profiling,"BACKGROUND Aberrant patterns of DNA methylation is a typical hallmark of cancer. Several studies have reported DNA hypermethylation of a significant number of genes in various malignancies. This suggests a role of hypermethylation in the initiation and progression of cancer. In this study, we investigated genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation in prostate cancer (PCa). We compared alterations between tumor (Tu) and adjacent epithelial (Ep) tissues in order to identify hypermethylated genes in promoter regions associated with initiation and progression of prostate cancer. METHODS The study included 33 tumor samples including 21 paired Tu and Ep samples from 21 radical prostatectomy patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from FFPE tissue blocks. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Infinium Illumina 450K array. A mixed linear model, with a random effect for patient, main effect of tissue, and covariate of array batch, was employed to identify probes that differed in methylation between tissue types. Multiple comparison adjustment was performed using the FDR (false discovery rate) method. RESULTS In total, 8791 hypermethylated CpG sites in the promoter regions were identified in Tu versus Ep tissue with FDR adjusted P CONCLUSIONS This study identified promoter hypermethylation of several genes in PCa. These newly identified hypermethylated genes are potential biomarker candidates for PCa diagnosis. Currently we are evaluating the functional significance of these hypermethylated genes in prostate cancer.

cf7c13fc9940649965c549099b949d86e49fa4d5,Computational methods to estimate error rates for peptide identifications in mass spectrometry-based proteomics,"In the field of proteomics, tandem mass spectrometry is the core technology which promises to identify peptide components within complex mixtures on a large scale. Currently the bottleneck is to reduce the error rates and assign accurate statistical estimates of peptide identifications. In this work, we introduce the techniques of identifying chimeric spectra, where two or more precursor ions with similar mass and retention time are co-fragmented and sequenced by the MS/MS instrument. Based on this, we try to analyze the factor which leads to the high error rate of identifications. We show that chimeric spectra have high correlations with the ranking scores and can reduce the number of positive identifications. Additionally, we address the problem of assigning a posterior error probability (PEP) to the individual peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) that are obtained via search engines. This problem is computationally more difficult than estimating the error rate associated with a large collection of PSMs, such as false discovery rate (FDR). Existing methods rely on parametric or semiparametric models of the underlying score distribution as a preassumption. We provide a so-called kernel logistic regression procedure without any explicit assumptions about the score distribution. Based on an appropriate positive definite Gaussian kernel, the resulting PEP estimate is proven to be robust by achieving a close correspondence between the PEP-derived q-values and FDR-derived q-values. Furthermore, we also accept at least 200 more significant PSMs with setting a threshold based on PEP-derived q-values compared to FDR-derived q-values. Finally, we show that this kernel logistic regression method is well established in the statistics literature and it can produce accurate PEP estimates for different types of PSM score functions and data.

Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) have been linked to memory impairment, but the spatial and temporal dynamics of this relationship remain elusive. In the present study, we aim to systematically characterize the brain areas and times at which IEDs affect memory.


METHODS
Eighty epilepsy patients participated in a delayed free recall task while undergoing intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. We analyzed the locations and timing of IEDs relative to the behavioral data in order to measure their effects on memory.


RESULTS
Overall IED rates did not correlate with task performance across subjects (r = 0.03, p = 0.8). However, at a finer temporal scale, within-subject memory was negatively affected by IEDs during the encoding and recall periods of the task but not during the rest and distractor periods (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p = 0.3, and p = 0.8, respectively). The effects of IEDs during encoding and recall were stronger in the left hemisphere than in the right (p < 0.05). Of six brain areas analyzed, IEDs in the inferior-temporal, medial-temporal, and parietal areas significantly affected memory (false discovery rate < 0.05).


SIGNIFICANCE
These findings reveal a network of brain areas sensitive to IEDs with key nodes in temporal as well as parietal lobes. They also demonstrate the time-dependent effects of IEDs in this network on memory.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter C.

db713282edc34099685129d136f0e85556e6621e,Comparison of human glomerulus proteomic profiles obtained from low quantities of samples by different mass spectrometry with the comprehensive database,"BackgroundWe have previously constructed an in-depth human glomerulus proteome database from a large amount of sample for understanding renal disease pathogenesis and aiding the biomarker exploration. However, it is usually a challenge for clinical research to get enough tissues for large-scale proteomic characterization. Therefore, in this study, we focused on high-confidence proteomics analysis on small amounts of human glomeruli comparable to those obtained from biopsies using different mass spectrometers and compared these results to the comprehensive database.ResultsOne microgram of human glomerular protein digest was analyzed each on five LC- combined mass spectrometers (LIT-TOF, LTQ-Orbitrap, Q-TOF, LIT and MALDI-TOF/TOF) yielding 139, 185, 94, 255 and 108 proteins respectively identified with strict criteria to ensure high confidence (> 99%) and low false discovery rate (FDR) (< 1%). An integrated profile of 332 distinct glomerular proteins was subsequently generated without discerned bias due to protein physicochemical properties (pI and MW), of which around 60% were detected commonly by more than two LC-MS/MS platforms. Comparative analysis with the comprehensive database demonstrated 14 proteins uniquely identified in this study and more than 70% of identified proteins in small datasets were concentrated to the top abundant 500 in the comprehensive database which consists of 2775 non-redundant proteins.ConclusionThis study showed representative human glomerulus proteomic profiles obtained from biopsies through analysis of comparable amounts of samples by different mass spectrometry. Our results implicated that high abundant proteins are more likely to be reproducibly identified in multiple mass spectrometers runs and different mass spectrometers. Furthermore, many podocyte essential proteins such as nephrin, podocin, podocalyxin and synaptopodin were also identified from the small samples in this study. Bioinformatic enrichment analysis results extended our understanding of the major glomerular proteins about their subcellular distributions and functions. The present study indicated that the proteins localized in certain cellular compartments, such as actin cytoskeleton, mitochondrial matrix, cell surface, basolateral plasma membrane, contractile fiber, proteinaceous extracellular matrix and adherens junction, represent high abundant glomerular proteins and these subcellular structures are also highly significantly over-represented in the glomerulus compared to the whole human background.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Zhang"", ids = ""49890466""); list(name = ""Yutaka Yoshida"", ids = ""145155750""); list(name = ""Bo Xu"", ids = ""143876192""); list(name = ""Sameh Magdeldin"", ids = ""2530466""); list(name = ""Hidehiko Fujinaka"", ids = ""2028704""); list(name = ""Zan Liu"", ids = ""49293380""); list(name = ""Masahito Miyamoto"", ids = ""4705037""); list(name = ""Eishin Yaoita"", ids = ""3206943""); list(name = ""Tadashi Yamamoto"", ids = ""144392147"")",36b9994bc0a9bcdba3900b35d13233ff4ed07b5c; db713282edc34099685129d136f0e85556e6621e; ddd84a6e3eeeb93bf0b4a75f251d3a9668ee49ed; a833a7cbefda5cec044a83a8bdd9d1ad085f5665; 0cf6052f23d82906822a2fb0f1ccffaca28fcc74; 1c0e254be573a4c77f7c010960a70651b33a8875; 51045764cce062b94b1b956ef049cc04304dd653; 004f659e4f1601993b09b2725135253c5fec67ca; a32bee44c213bad26eb1aa2497a7cbb9269dd56b; bd62da397ac9d77605a73597e0a7c50dcf4c44b9,2ff584dfbe33cde116fe376488fe281b26d05881; 02861331baa0345fce280566ce10cd9bf89ed6d6; 48ab8ff779e031e22262e2a4ffa4baf19cb22056; eac4b08a45aea6f56ad337b8eeeb33b4153726f9; bfda629ecc784739eff0b1c79f5f7678424ca447; 02d6aea73587b6afed6c5eb43277f06448d77233; 7f22cdd3a72ff9eb894de505606a9883f3665391; 56a743cbff47e22fc34cf3f27adcc8b5342bae1b; 27d942d4ae218d0f0f8d784f745e5324e067eea5; db713282edc34099685129d136f0e85556e6621e; 9ef6ec7f8643089b9720d59e9322ca494d789660; ad0a6862775c190d69dad743675dc22616b38584; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 130ba29cc30dd64e33c0a7d464caee688784f36c; d0b3ea580b913e1101b8c8f2dc8c764749407265; d2e426c555936c7812bd6f1c4ccc2a9b9efdaf55; 3c390107b9508ca8595253e7561b1f5a3fbe0d0a; f25e3f21bf3cd90f1d91816a9544dbeb2fe1af12; df1e1bbb9b59a307096fa70527f21e2d1bc1a6e6; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 8f52da6d198078b4b2fed870416acb6fcf6b8915; ffce110ba43e28879da676ba9f6e159baddbe311; 44fb0da3eef2b0d840447b297be554abebe1a3f1; 30dfe04bdf0aca5b1ca35adcb083e765363550c5; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; e02408149a49987efd723ddf09b356d436b366fa; 49b4fcdc96d69a10d6942f7effb5980e8124845c,Proteome Science,9,47 - 47
17e1ffc301ca28fd212fdec66191053cc31c2192,Metabolic Biosynthesis Pathways Identified from Fecal Microbiome Associated with Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND
The fecal microbiome is associated with prostate cancer risk factors (obesity, inflammation) and can metabolize and produce various products that may influence cancer but have yet to be defined in prostate cancer.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate gut bacterial diversity, identify specific metabolic pathways associated with disease, and develop a microbiome risk profile for prostate cancer.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
After prospective collection of 133 rectal swab samples 2 wk before the transrectal prostate biopsy, we perform 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on 105 samples (64 with cancer, 41 without cancer). Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was applied to infer functional categories associated with taxonomic composition. The p values were adjusted using the false discovery rate. The Î±- and Î²-diversity analyses were performed using QIIME. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of Î²-diversity distances within and between groups of interest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to determine pathway significance.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The detection of prostate cancer on transrectal prostate needle biopsy and 16s microbiome profile.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
We identified significant associations between total community composition and cancer/non-cancer status (Bray-Curtis distance metric, p<0.01). We identified significant differences in enrichments of Bacteroides and Streptococcus species in cancer (all p<0.04). Folate (LDA 3.8) and arginine (LDA 4.1) were the most significantly altered pathways. We formed a novel microbiome-derived risk factor for prostate cancer based on 10 aberrant metabolic pathways (area under curve=0.64, p=0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
Microbiome analyses on men undergoing prostate biopsy noted mostly similar bacterial species diversity among men diagnosed with and without prostate cancer. The microbiome may have subtle influences on prostate cancer but are likely patient-specific and would require paired analysis and precise manipulation, such as improvement of natural bacterial folate production.


PATIENT SUMMARY
Microbiome evaluation may provide patients with personalized data regarding the presence or absence of particular bacteria that have metabolic functions and implications regarding prostate cancer risk. The study provides a basis to investigate the manipulation of aberrant microbiomes to reduce prostate cancer risk.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael A Liss"", ids = ""6765855""); list(name = ""James Robert White"", ids = ""49884811""); list(name = ""Martin W Goros"", ids = ""9584111""); list(name = ""Jonathan A.

00a1d4399fd49c932f4bc52217d135ef2ea4a01c,Life without Oxygen: Gene Regulatory Responses of the Crucian Carp (Carassius carassius) Heart Subjected to Chronic Anoxia,"Crucian carp are unusual among vertebrates in surviving extended periods in the complete absence of molecular oxygen. During this time cardiac output is maintained though these mechanisms are not well understood. Using a high-density cDNA microarray, we have defined the genome-wide gene expression responses of cardiac tissue after exposing the fish at two temperatures (8 and 13 Â°C) to one and seven days of anoxia, followed by seven days after restoration to normoxia. At 8 Â°C, using a false discovery rate of 5%, neither anoxia nor re-oxygenation elicited appreciable changes in gene expression. By contrast, at 13 Â°C, 777 unique genes responded strongly. Up-regulated genes included those involved in protein turnover, the pentose phosphate pathway and cell morphogenesis while down-regulated gene categories included RNA splicing and transcription. Most genes were affected between one and seven days of anoxia, indicating gene regulation over the medium term but with few early response genes. Re-oxygenation for 7 days was sufficient to completely reverse these responses. Glycolysis displayed more complex responses with anoxia up-regulated transcripts for the key regulatory enzymes, hexokinase and phosphofructokinase, but with down-regulation of most of the non-regulatory genes. This complex pattern of responses in genomic transcription patterns indicates divergent cardiac responses to anoxia, with the transcriptionally driven reprogramming of cardiac function seen at 13 Â°C being largely completed at 8 Â°C.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""KÃ¥re-Olav StenslÃ¸kken"", ids = ""1397656998""); list(name = ""Stian Ellefsen"", ids = ""4237546""); list(name = ""Olga Vasieva"", ids = ""8300285""); list(name = ""Yongxiang Fang"", ids = ""32965602""); list(name = ""Anthony P Farrell"", ids = ""34920497""); list(name = ""Lisa Olohan"", ids = ""4277297""); list(name = ""Jarle Vaage"", ids = ""4377494""); list(name = ""GÃ¶ran E Nilsson"", ids = ""32668738""); list(name = ""Andrew R Cossins"", ids = ""6278646"")",805fc3a7c8fe689905d13cc0f099276d3e8a0371; 92ffeb294bb121fea44d302d394651c7f5aae9fd; f1519eee1b16acd0fdd438a793766dc5a059ce66; 14175ebca2c898f3326769d7fc5a9d6cedb26bb2; b3df1a10ca5d278670647a5693193ca4028314b1; 8dc898095dbbe9a0aa190b0584ab197f85ff9fe0,f2086c7259a190086a685ef68daf947f66d82d16; 8ea209e78decaf543e9fa3799e783f55b6a18777; 321281a7e8321dd044f91b6645a182ff9e7703f3; abb1be06be0a57e121fea7ab8c556be3515824bc; 23cfc186d4fe0c6f46421a8974d78c212a5cf433; faa2e5c1a0eb39bd928b99edbeaee32054fdb41e; 269a8428ea9d00a57792fe544ec2d784c476f3c0; 574a611d55a89e57369c035d2694743cb3c22d6d; 13385cdae7c02326dea524bf58f4b00a4814562e; dc1a01690ddca5e5d79f14dea0124e4bf74e3b25; bc69fed83d991ffeb94e27d76331eb4c0a535a89; 55b72101984279fd28e9f1b1e9c952ec7714113c; 90544937311dca5bae1fe255bc071fb81cd45505; b3676ab7cf2fabb721113edf3df6e8e18ad55f5a; 360ee2f43782b8bdf4d8631ded49eb1183d43481; 76518f971072c802578a323965eee2a8c81cf726; 7183630a416daf54dd8f0d4acee7d960ce32b9bd; b7d62cfb860619daa1607ea58240553a423f5790; bf0a25bd0f82628f0ae71a3c7f1cf141accb30da; 7db2617c3f631e467c11ed1741e962e875e5f58b; f6dba573ced1fa0dd7a0e37fbda54c00f9245b5d; 3c3ed9fb6270c40877c4fffc95c55de88343c540; 4fbdfc0e2d5ae13d04c321f9697241544311a49d; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; a3365b65ed0f8fd2f4a5f42723be4970d9d7d9cf; 5d97a58136c9b7c5f591da10e3cd876ba132ad59; a59fba4cefc03b75d5021c32687f58a943bfd7c9; d3321a8e773916b4c0982742e86709067a348f6b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 454261e5281293f4a82336ee31b6b509b5505c48; f350ac02d45c3f4973924b01a1ed4f155fcc263b; 0ae37139d05784c2c274bcc7c9445855b3138b48; f5cedc71ea517136d25a4d1ab495cb21d1bd0787; d35e05177bdba96c13441687053ef983273c47a5; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 3b5aaa637cb143c97c117df99d38c364d5c00d30; 75bf326ed343e895b2b0e731c71b4ca6740966a7; e402907638d40a96138b1387a2f7e6f1a90b1914; aebacfece4c4c8b9a3d1c4b980debd99f6344d06; 113e0d966a07bf6afd9633e2d297a2d18aa0d02a; 829f72449039e1f335de39c16ed9f22bd8328175; 6c412fe8ead2f39e5b83c0469fdf7a3113c4690a; c1678756e345ea314561b06ca5983f48e099914f; cca1bd5b4c43524473f3e7a442dfcbc3a9b140d1; aa679666700fb2bea0f03b317712e2763c31ebf0; 26e597bb2b2f7b636b463fcce883c81d95a85d09; 0b7b1177c26b1a5cdb4b32fd9e1f50f3142c3b8e; f187cea808ddbcbad982c45e09ec7db9f1b96fc8; 160b65598a13f2c7c868b9814bcd8660e11376c8; b81e61b920b986ff1495af426aad7437c9011d85; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; 412312b5e748d4587c8dcb5e4ef43abbbe14d20a; d99070df49000063153888b25d7a1184ce49871c; 3ca53db95bd6d3f79b9f372c18d9b7e09bddce30; 5b83b2c26b990434fb0124a6cdd653b1bba16b3d; 3f8540976c2bc9d6fe61a48aa07381d4abbd5ebe; bab1af77dc38b5fd7fd089e81ec581959f5dd237; bee29f6d84c91275c9e099d22a9c3d80f1365e27; fd82e9b66a5fa87712251fd623af9050d0e2c50b; b9d0ccf6523f47d89b8cdedb5c2b95d0e0be02f3; 58ba6ee57c4782ef7b2dcc360901a6aa7d709b34; eba91b96b70ce65624f9575c0209cfa43d02c5e8; 15e8bc77c79a7288dc0e7816bec70b36958faaa5,PLoS ONE,9,

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the US. Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is a glycoprotein hormone that causes Mullerian duct regression through a complex of TGF- Î² family homologous receptors: a type II ligand-binding receptor (T2R) and a tissue-specific type I receptor (T1R) that initiates downstream signaling. MIS has been proposed as potential therapeutic agent in OC. We have previously shown that specific combination of T2R/T1R receptors are expressed on OC cells, however data is lacking on the MIS-dependent pathways activated in OC cells in a T1R-specific manner. These limitations hinder further development of MIS as a therapy. We sought to determine the downstream signaling pathways activated by MIS in a T1R specific manner. We designed a chimeric OC cell model system in which GM-CSF can function as the ligand to specifically activate candidate T2R/T1R combinations (MISRII with either ALK2, ALK3, or ALK6). RNA-Seq technology was used to identify differentially expressed early and late response genes. Over 15,032 genes were analyzed, restricted to genes in which there were > 32 counts for duplicate samples. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity's Integrative Pathway Analysis Tool (IPA) for genes which were expressed over 2 fold, with an False Discovery Rate (FDR) -0.001. We observed 56, 37, and 51 early response (1hr) genes which were up- or down-regulated after stimulation in OC cells engineered to express either ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6, respectively. We identified a subset of 18 of genes (e.g., ID1, SMAD7, FOSB) which were upregulated after treatment in all MISRII/T1R combinations, suggesting redundancy amongst the three T1R partner receptors. These observations will be confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. A majority of these redundant genes are known to play roles in TGF-Î² signaling and cell proliferation pathways. Importantly, as we have previously shown that not all T1R candidates are expressed in OC, we report subsets of genes (e.g., RASSF6, C/EBPBÎ², CSMD3) which were uniquely altered after stimulation only in the presence of a specific T1R. This indicates specific pathway activation is dependent upon T1R expression pattern in OC and likely determines response. In addition to previously known TGF- Î² signaling pathway, we found gene signatures (e.g. FOSB, RASSF6, LRP1B, ID1) suggesting pathways which affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, chemotherapy resistance, and DNA repair in response to MIS. This is the first study to begin to define the specific roles candidate T1R's play in signaling in response to MIS in an OC model. An understanding of these pathways is a necessary prerequisite to examining MIS as a therapy. These preliminary data suggest a role for MIS in apoptosis, cytotoxic drug resistance and DNA repair. This can be used to test combination therapy with currently available drugs and MIS in OC treatment.

Por outro lado, se produzidas em excesso, podem provocar oxidacao lipidica, de proteinas ou do DNA causando o que conhecemos por estresse oxidativo. Para combater o excesso de especies reativas, os organimos produzem moleculas antioxidantes tais como os carotenoides e enzimas como superoxido dismutase e catalase. No entanto, e dificil apontar as estrategias de adaptacao dos micro-organismos em resposta a diferentes condicoes de estresse atraves do estudo individual de moleculas produzidas. Diante do exposto, esta pesquisa teve por objetivo elucidar o genoma, proteoma e transcriptoma bem como a producao de carotenoides da bacteria termofila Thermus filiformis quando submetida a algumas condicoes de cultivo: presenca e ausencia de H2O2 e temperatura de crescimento abaixo (63 ?C) e acima (77 ?C) do seu otimo (70 ?C). Para tanto, o genoma e transcriptoma foram analisados com o emprego de tecnologias de sequenciamento de ultima geracao e ferramentas computacionais, e a proteomica e os carotenoides foram caracterizados por cromatografia liquida e espectrometria de massas. Alem disso, devido a conhecida capacidade antioxidante e alto potencial de aplicabilidade na industria farmaceutica, cosmetica e de formulacao de alimentos, foi feita a clonagem, expressao e caracterizacao da enzima superoxido dismutase de Thermus filiformis (TfSOD). A TfSOD apresentou atividade enzimatica utilizando como cofator tanto manganes quanto ferro e termoestabilidade a ate 80 ?C. O sequenciamento de DNA produziu um total de 9.680.471 reads pareados e uma montagem com n50 = 85,2Kb, n90 = 17,1kb, contig de maior tamanho com 275,5kb e um tamanho total de 2,46MB. A predicao genetica resultou em 2.403 genes codificadores de proteinas. Na analise de transcriptoma, 97,1% dos genes codificadores de proteinas preditos apresentaram expressao com valores detectaveis de RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization). Atraves da analise do transcriptoma foram identificados 37% e 5,86% dos genes diferencialmente expressos (p-valor<0,05) nos ensaios com diferentes temperaturas e com e sem adicao de H2O2, respectivamente. Atraves da analise do proteoma, no ensaio com diferentes temperaturas, foi encontrado um total de 27,7% proteinas diferencialmente expressas com um FDR (False Discovery Rate) < 0,05%, sendo 20% significativamente diferentes (p-valor<0,05, teste T) e, no ensaio com e sem adicao de H2O2, um total de 28,3% com um FDR < 0,05%, sendo 6% significativamente diferentes (p-valor<0,05, teste T). Algumas diferencas foram observadas na producao de carotenoides de acordo com cada condicao de cultivo. Quanto ao perfil de carotenoides, nas condicoes a 70 ?C e a 77 ?C os carotenoides majoritarios foram termozeaxantina-15 e termozeaxantina-13, enquanto que para condicao a 63 ?C foram termozeaxantina-15 e zeaxantina livre. A amostra cultivada a 70 ?C sem adicao de H2O2 apresentou a maior quantidade de carotenoides totais (1.516 ?g/g), por outro lado o extrato rico em carotenoides que apresentou maior capacidade de desativacao do radical peroxila (50,5) foi o da amostra com adicao de H2O2. Os resultados do presente estudo mostram que os principais processos afetados pela mudanca de temperatura e adicao de peroxido de hidrogenio foram: catabolismo, transcricao e traducao de proteinas. Observou-se tambem que a alteracao na temperatura teve uma maior influencia na expressao diferencial de genes e proteinas do que a adicao de peroxido. Atraves das analises do trancriptoma e do proteoma de T. filiformis foram identificadas enzimas termo-estaveis com potencial de aplicacao industrial, como por exemplo alfa-amilases, alfa-galactosidases e esterases. Alem disso, o extrato rico em carotenoides dessa bacteria apresentou capacidade de desativar o radical peroxila superior a capacidade de extratos de frutas e ate mesmo de padroes de caroten",2014,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Fernanda Dagostim Mandelli"", ids = ""4671327""); list(name = ""Adriana Zerlotti Mercadante"", ids = ""4668889"")",,,,,
42b7d4d051da97a7958d890b630490232ccecb94,Genome-Wide Association Studies for Bivariate Sparse Longitudinal Data,"Objective: Longitudinal measurements with bivariate response have been analyzed by several authors using two separate models for each response. However, for most of the biological or medical experiments, the two responses are highly correlated and hence a separate model for each response might not be a desirable way to analyze such data. A single model considering a bivariate response provides a more powerful inference as the correlation between the responses is modeled appropriately. In this article, we propose a dynamic statistical model to detect the genes controlling human blood pressure (systolic and diastolic). Methods: By modeling the mean function with orthogonal Legendre polynomials and the covariance matrix with a stationary parametric structure, we incorporate the statistical ideas in functional genome-wide association studies to detect SNPs which have significant control on human blood pressure. The traditional false discovery rate is used for multiple comparisons. Results: We analyze the data from the Framingham Heart Study to detect such SNPs by appropriately considering gender-gene interaction. We detect 8 SNPs for males and 7 for females which are most significant in controlling blood pressure. The genotype-specific mean curves and additive and dominant effects over time are shown for each significant SNP for both genders. Simulation studies are performed to examine the statistical properties of our model. The current model will be extremely useful in detecting genes controlling different traits and diseases for humans or non-human subjects.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kiranmoy Das"", ids = ""2381001""); list(name = ""Jiahan Li"", ids = ""46275987""); list(name = ""Guifang Fu"", ids = ""37839912""); list(name = ""Zhong Wang"", ids = ""29507249""); list(name = ""Rongling Wu"", ids = ""145209799"")",ca65ddd00af058e0ba17ca0463a62681d4ac29d4; 0afa6b66ec7773d70b1725330ee2e89e08bf34bb; 8d6d653decea3f9d42a146c73264a949f5fc6d0e; a0c50b8c017afbfbded2059065e7f78d4a007216; 4299afb6d9513cf4aea341184fcf183fb367c9f2; ecd7df79ca9f5afdcebef780ef9359c2581a1db5; 24fb69bbf7f5bb65f3ea4186dd33c9207f639064; 7221d6c7bbb9c076798d576cd7ae19c88f434744,01001eb20125a2667831dbfabe99636f8994f248; ac98e04d63877af71930dd71101f5b0b783da41b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d730158789a11c411c1a6c25747a447c108ad527; a900a462204df76c45ce9d1d2dd7bfae00844ca3; 28a100644e4adc037dd09cfb9d1552a2bd76380e; cf60165dd62d30ef2f19bafab12fa8fd6bcffbcc; 716dd077612848ad61ef6852c10f7b90c36ed233; f644e26228b4608ed7ca5a5e65319b57f4065923; 20cdc7af93dd1cc59ead9e80899386afe7f7fe4d; bee9d5c261c04a4f9d4cf5fea5a11b8f54eef1e4; a34caed1c8e50b626b12ae262f244be5bf6ed44c; ff36fadf2deb508ccde1050e3d01c8fa249ad51c,Human Heredity,72,110 - 120
d387e8fa5d8b85f16ac5fd92704af91eb3088e32,Genomeâ€wide scans between two honeybee populations reveal putative signatures of humanâ€mediated selection,"Human-mediated selection has left signatures in the genomes of many domesticated animals, including the European dark honeybee, Apis mellifera mellifera, which has been selected by apiculturists for centuries. Using whole-genome sequence information, we investigated selection signatures in spatially separated honeybee subpopulations (Switzerland, nÂ =Â 39 and France, nÂ =Â 17). Three different test statistics were calculated in windows of 2Â kb (fixation index, cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity and cross-population composite likelihood ratio) and combined into a recently developed composite selection score. Applying a stringent false discovery rate of 0.01, we identified six significant selective sweeps distributed across five chromosomes covering eight genes. These genes are associated with multipleÂ molecular andÂ biological functions, including regulation of transcription, receptor binding and signal transduction. Of particular interest is a selection signature on chromosome 1, which corresponds to the WNT4 gene, the family of which is conserved across the animal kingdom with a variety of functions. In Drosophila melanogaster, WNT4 alleles have been associated with differential wing, cross vein and abdominal phenotypes. Defining phenotypic characteristics of different Apis mellifera ssp., which are typically used as selection criteria, include colour and wing venation pattern. This signal is therefore likely to be a good candidate for human mediated-selection arising from different applied breeding practices in the two managed populations.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Melanie Parejo"", ids = ""35767665""); list(name = ""David Wragg"", ids = ""47623463""); list(name = ""Dora Henriques"", ids = ""5191081""); list(name = ""Alain Vignal"", ids = ""4798739""); list(name = ""Markus Neuditschko"", ids = ""2783155"")",5c4b852834ef0fda3968f093140545f4e789c5be,d8acfc38795a82cf0fdada511db89e6a0dfbec7c; 2eaea55ddcc367173bf8fd2e9348e789cd0e7215; 6ca23bca7951edffa40becb04588d325711659d3; 538c45a7fdb90e23df486ccbd45c7be6ea7de4b4; 2f9937c7772198174ed80fd091b003cf889794c7; 1475d8b20e303c2ef49449556bec3d9191e51415; 523cdc73c7c45d0e3875419ce481fe6609b651ed; 6f523804453eca5ba4ca4a9edfe8874ea29ca2ef; ec6bd84ff698e3cc2fe1266e4e26b2cdc030516b; 6126379e9ffbf088fc5cf838ba53a9b95526d0d5; eb4341d9c80fa7439ad4f8a288f122762a2daefc,Animal Genetics,48,704 - 707

Numerous studies have revealed recurring molecular alterations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from MDS patients as presumable cause for the persistent dysfunction of their hematopoiesis. However, how these events translate into disturbed regulation of erythropoiesis is poorly understood so far. Characterization of the transcriptional network and associated epigenetic changes in dysplastic erythroprogenitor cells might therefore aid in the elucidation of functional molecular consequences finally leading to impaired erythropoiesis. Methods CD71+ erythroprogenitor cells were isolated from purified bone marrow cells via magnetic cell separation for 15 MDS patients (IPSS low/int-1 risk n=11, int-2/high risk n=4) and 7 age-adjusted healthy donors. Extracted DNA and RNA were processed and hybridized to Affymetrix Exon 1.0 ST Array and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchips according to manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Data analysis was carried out using Qlucore Omics Explorer 2.3 and in-house scripts for correlation of the two datasets were developed using Python 2.7.5. Results Using a false discovery rate/q-value of â‰¤ 4% as a cutoff for differential gene expression and CpG DNA methylation, both datasets allowed highly distinct clustering into MDS IPSS low/int-1 risk, int-2/high risk and healthy donor groups. In our MDS low/int-1 risk cohort 63 genes have been identified as significantly up- and 13 as downregulated (fold change â‰¥1.5, pâ‰¤0.001) while 64 genes showed up- and 28 downregulation in the MDS int-2/high risk group (fold change â‰¥1.5 pâ‰¤0.01). Surprisingly, global DNA methylation profiling revealed that 741 CpGs were detected as hypo- but only 19 as hypermethylated in low/int-1 risk, whereas 231 CpGs demonstrated hypo- and 479 hypermethylation in int-2/high risk MDS CD71+ cells relative to healthy controls (mean CpG methylation difference â‰¥10%, pâ‰¤0.0001). In order to discover genes susceptible to DNA methylation associated regulation of transcription, individual CpG methylation values were correlated with corresponding exon probeset expression intensities for every single gene. Using this approach, starting with >23x10 6 possible CpG/probeset combinations, 4418 displayed significant positive correlation, whereas only 2726 were negatively correlated (Râ‰¥0.6 or Râ‰¤-0.6, mean methylation difference MDS vs. healthy â‰¥5%, pâ‰¤0.01). Consequently, in MDS low/int-1 risk we identified strong hypomethylation as putative cause for a 5.8-fold upregulation of GDF15, an important regulatory factor involved in iron homeostasis. Moreover, DNA hypermethylation associated 6.6-fold knockdown of the transcription factor GTSF1, which has been associated with increased apoptosis in gametogenesis, was demonstrated for MDS int-2/high-risk. In this cohort, we also observed a 3-fold upregulation of LY6E, which has been shown to result in a strong block of differentiation and maintenance of self-renewal in avian erythroprogenitor cells. Consistently, gene set enrichment analysis identified a stem cell like gene signature as highly enriched in MDS CD71+ BM cells but also gene sets involved in oxidative phosphorylation as well as regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. Conclusion Our integrative approach reveals novel candidate genes implicated in disturbed erythropoiesis in MDS and allows distinctive separation between healthy donors and MDS risk groups by assessment of epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes derived from CD71+ bone marrow cells. DNA hypomethylation induced gene upregulation surprisingly appears to be a common event in MDS erythropoiesis which co-occurs with DNA hypermethylation induced gene silencing. In addition, frequent detection of significant positive correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression might add an additional layer of complexity to the current dogma of epigenetic gene regulation. Finally, the distinctively hypermethylated geneset in MDS high-risk as compared to the unexpected global hypomethylation phenotype in MDS low-risk might suggest a mechanistic explanation for the selective efficacy of demethylating substances specifically in the higher risk patient groups.

2eac7e897b756eed069150dc1cd98b9b3acb085c,DNA methylation signature of smoking in lung cancer is enriched for exposure signatures in newborn and adult blood,"Background Smoking impacts DNA methylation genome-wide in blood of both newborns from maternal smoking during pregnancy and adults from personal smoking. Smoking causes lung cancer which involves aberrant methylation. We examined whether DNA methylation smoking signatures identified in blood of newborns and adults are detectable in lung tumors. Methods We compared smoking-related DNA methylation in lung adenocarcinomas (61 never smokers, 91 current smokers, and 238 former smokers) quantified with the Illumina450k BeadArray in The Cancer Genome Atlas with published large consortium meta-analyses of newborn and adult blood. We assessed whether CpG sites related to smoking in blood from newborns and adults were enriched in lung adenocarcinoma. Results Testing CpGs differentially methylated by smoke exposure (P<10âˆ’4) we identified 296 in lung tumors, while previous meta-analyses (False Discovery Rate (FDR)<0.05) identified 6,073 in newborn blood, and for adult smoking, 18,760 in blood. The lung signals were highly enriched for those seen in newborn (32 overlapping, Penrichment=1.2Ã—10âˆ’19) and adult blood (86 overlapping, Penrichment = 9.5Ã—10âˆ’49). The 65 genes annotated to CpGs differentially methylated in lung tumors, but not blood, were enriched for RNA processing ontologies. Conclusions We found highly significant overlap between smoking-related DNA methylation signals in lung cancer and those seen in blood from newborns, from in utero exposure, or adults, from their own exposure. These results suggest that some epigenetic alterations associated with cigarette smoke exposure are tissue specific, but others are common across tissues.

We explored whether the epigenetic markers, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), were associated with incident diabetes in Japanese Americans. We conducted a pilot study (nâ€‰=â€‰10) using plasma from age- and sex-matched participants who did or did not develop diabetes in the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study, an observational study of diabetes risk factors. Extraction and high-throughput sequencing of miRNAs were performed using samples collected at baseline. Regression models were fit comparing circulating miRNAs (Nâ€‰=â€‰1640) among individuals who did or did not develop incident diabetes at 10-year follow-up. Participants averaged 51.7 years of age at baseline; 60% were male. We identified 36 miRNAs present at different (10 higher and 26 lower) levels in individuals who developed diabetes compared to those who did not (log2fold change â‰¥1.25 and false discovery rate â‰¤5%). These included miRNAs with functions in skeletal muscle insulin metabolism (miR-106b and miR-20b-5p) and miRNAs with functions in both skeletal muscle insulin metabolism and cell cycle regulation in endocrine pancreas (miR-15a and miR-17). Circulating miRNAs were associated with subsequent development of diabetes among Japanese Americans over 10 years of follow-up. Results are preliminary.

672e17435003568d52099a65c6a31c9d38ebd071,The effects of aging vs. Î±7 nAChR subunit deficiency on the mouse brain transcriptome: aging beats the deficiency,"Aging is accompanied by expression changes in multiple genes, and the brain is one of the tissues most vulnerable to aging. Since the Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive decline during aging, we hypothesized that its absence might affect gene expression profiles in aged brains. To study whether transcriptional changes occur due to aging, Î±7 deficiency, or both, we analyzed whole-brain transcriptomes of young (8Â weeks) and aged (2Â years) Î±7-deficient and wild-type control mice, using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray. Highly significant expression changes were detected in 47 and 1,543 genes [after Bonferroni and false discovery rate (FDR) correction] in the brains of aged mice compared to young mice, regardless of their genotype. These included genes involved in immune system function and ribosome structure, as well as genes that were previously demonstrated as differentially expressed in aging human brains. Genotype-dependent changes were detected in only three genes, Chrna7 which encodes the Î±7 nAChR subunit, and two closely linked genes, likely due to a â€œmouse background effect.â€ Expression changes dependent on ageâ€“genotype interaction were detected in 207 genes (with a low significance threshold). Age-dependent differential expression levels were approved in all nine genes that were chosen for validation by real-time RT-PCR. Our results suggest that the robust effect of aging on brain transcription clearly overcomes the almost negligible effect of Î±7 nAChR subunit deletion and that germ line deficiency of this subunit has a minor effect on brain expression profile in aged mice.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Merav Kedmi"", ids = ""5695834""); list(name = ""Avi Orr-Urtreger"", ids = ""1438508085"")",77a50053c2e4f8bb5227ca25631c37dc14184718; 0209b3bf47b9e1072623034de0473a8283f8f230; 9a81108f8d168c225a1fc37dc515a482ffc67f40; e0b2b05e2f96aa48f59902fc03f24b66634f0d09; 7efd86f2a60222370c3a1e15013a2fa9fa0d9f27; 6f669073c93556168b4fb90eefcea7aa4b62a27d,0292518e5f9c5de43b87b38fa62faa73e35e3ee4; 1f7e50cf44c16407c2287d3603b6142d889316a1; 4b6bf5ebc15acbeedde89ddcd6000325ba9b608d; 0bf4aa2a9696b4bc2f5b2dfe3f1c9f6dfdd24ca3; 0c3082ea859c47c1ddc9ab213b0f9ddc4263d6ca; 15df895c7d22c69c5cc6c9d3ebf69183307e0f7a; f0461092a6246142f64aff8a5ddc9e228a8c4b19; 451cfa75e4b5dec1051a64c15f46491b0e6fd9ec; 3abec88b308a55d208632a841fb78635bbdd6461; 6122d1975516a22a13af1b2b4d9958e7bb5d94d4; a4d68cc34ffd7d1ab5e284658369d5cab730edea; 39fc6978c94fa78c4366e16d97978af2c1942f22; bbdde0ab357517edf9925d0be7db207d7c70619a; 43b15f4a7c217a15f775826ffd7c8fd24b6b2f7f; 15cb91c0eab3a28202030c9d65fd15e98dd8175f; eed14d630205d36e20dc6385ee184de6a28c143d; 0961e1fb54603c01fd47b48e58ec99d5e4dd64ab; 618e8468f9d4ccfa87d1169fda99e72cb2f7641d; af5f073bb9c85173010d146403896b2170408246; ae827e0f29aa311139f8c573b4b25aaab252e81f; 2ed12c5f5afc2289e7109bbd59f6bd80bdecf23b; 418852f39315725ed2c2ccfe661e4b3ee0d81124; 76dcbe9cf2cb62533b56a662b025c772fc27b8f4; a34e32243521abd1de118c8188b7b7870b5e5aa2; c76caf03d339805e57a7a5a85ab4f0ae2a014c04; 4e82d76eabe2cbe0803297be89b14f018ccac2d2; 84495f4fc21bb969445270b5da699769f7de67a5; 0c5c44daaa98683502315b566991d0f7f05d4784; 3c0a28b0f7aec1cc52ffdfadb3a34cc81e7c6020; 4580ba914fe16fae7d733b96e37a282bed953437; 06b9a7805b2e035dd1f4af8324ce9ef738bf2f65; 5c3e77c5b2e391a61a7c1085a31f42223549c029; 7bde27e449d1d8960bad9d48720466f786a05b09; 82d815182a02c1115c53c0ce52e52b483f1161a5; d15379b00cac2acc23b6149e4cf832918c34a57c; 336ae9d5787613507661db096233b8e1df83f6ae; 80d4e7e43e382acd73eaa9f8e66d3fe902d872e7; fcc84f0507e1b88f14c38b0050672204e4e03e0b; 568396cbc46fb593ed41d03f9616af7c4a2253df; 8b373d08b1e8cd1eb9d30e2576cd5318758560d5; 2f39d30481a9974a0b242d4d099b7e93c90cbd91; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; d2422434fa6a0b96bdca8b10d036e44635f61c0f; 097cfddd55b861ab4ed22e857f3e14b4997d179f; ec874bba94bc9e249047b3d060941640a7bb04b3; 509351e1f2353e9ef54f6de0eb6ee40c9d892bc9; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; cf4c32464e6953bedcc3f21cfec03aa89bf85a9f; 7d58612761125f6b52b2b7145b84d196ec5167fa; 9f89941c2fc668f0c0fe75c61cfd09caf65dca04; 5599c89264943a267b14cc699f7f06b1cd89250e; 36d2198fbf27e2ca9062c9e22f42a6659cbd7123; 427585300edfac25f2634c21dabcd55739f78db8; 5ecabce85a0060f56df07a736f2684a843dd255a; 04044832863df6a94d2084ac08db75e8aa0f6f1d; 6f93507c849b8e5a023c647cda2e87140accb0c5; 4b8a0d5fe4327b737fef8a901635053f56929fc4; 7461b356211fed48b7e6813db06b6dab0fc1facc; 994a529ee6c2e2ea2602d91cddb81a72f8013a33; 19b83c4788f073ff968f7205b0d973c6a1f925ce; 63fa133405312e6d81ac56276fca552f5a89bb94; 7b478b23cdb712d18fd014ecc0175096ddc4bf6a; 83b7a80fa5461d47a99bddbd00f3986f3e4c38a5; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 814ae1030bb6dba61101b077d5d862a51b1ede50; 27960a0fe0f9f481719cf19e9e84370c684c06fd; dd338711693eae3f2b83d40b24270c4fb0099e6b; 08b3185bd54b40487fcaedf5ac62e79919476e93; c52f81ba9a2ef1d848c50de0d84fea74896dbcca; a3ab74d52d372919afcae85b97c87316998d3c59,AGE,33,1-13

NETT-METTLERâ€¡ *Stolldesign, Muotathal, Switzerland â€ Hautarzt Zentrum, Liestal, Switzerland â€¡Tierâ‚¬ arztliche Spezialistenklinik Hâ‚¬ unenberg, Switzerland Alopecia X is a well-recognized syndrome of hair cycle arrest, of unknown cause, typically occurring in Pomeranians and other plush-coated dogs. It is characterized by symmetrical, noninflammatory alopecia without concurrent systemic signs. Currently recommended treatments show variable and often only partial clinical success. In humans, microneedling has been used in cosmetics and various medical treatments to induce the self-healing potential of the skin. It was hypothesized that superficial mechanical skin trauma with a microneedling device would induce generalized and permanent hair regrowth in alopecia X. Two four-year-old female spayed Pomeranian siblings were selected with clinical and histological changes compatible with alopecia X and in which neither melatonin, deslorelin nor topical minoxidil resulted in substantial or permanent hair regrowth. Under general anaesthesia the sterile microneedling device (Dermaroller MC925; Dermaroller GmbH, WolfenbÃ¼ttel, Germany) was rolled over alopecic areas with moderate pressure vertically, horizontally and diagonally until microbleeding was achieved. Five weeks after microneedling, hair re-growth was observed in both dogs followed by reduction of hyperpigmentation of the affected skin. After 12 weeks 90% of the coat had regrown and skin hyperpigmentation had started to subside. No adverse effects were observed. Coat quality had not deteriorated at the 12 months follow-up. This is the first report of successfully using microneedling to induce almost 100% hair regrowth in two dogs diagnosed with alopecia X. Microneedling may provide an alternative to conventional therapy for alopecia X and possibly other hair cycle arrest disorders. A larger case series is on the way to further elucidate the long-term success of microneedling. Sources of funding: Self-funded. Conflicts of interest: None declared.

CORNEGLIANI* *Ambulatorio Veterinario Associato, Torino, Italy A seven-year-old male mixed breed dog was referred for evaluation and treatment of acral lick dermatitis that had not responded to oral glucocorticoids and anti-depressive drugs. Firocoxib at 5 mg/kg daily for 6 months led to a 70% clinical improvement of skin lesions. After 9 months of firocoxib administration, the dog exhibited persistent vomiting despite concomitant anti-acid therapy and this drug was then withdrawn. Clinical examination revealed bilateral alopecic, erythematous, hyperpigmented and crusted lesions of 5-cm diameter on the dorsal carpus. Complementary tests were negative for parasitic infections; radiological and neurological examinations failed to reveal any associated problem. A complete blood count and biochemical profile were unremarkable. Cytology revealed secondary bacterial infection, which was treated with enrofloxacin at 5 mg/kg/daily for 4 weeks. Oclacitinib was then started at 0.4 mg/kg twice daily for two weeks and then once daily because of its activity as a pruritogenic cytokine inhibitor. After seventy days of therapy, the skin lesionsâ€™ diameters were reduced by 50%. Finally, skin lesions completely regressed after another 4 months of oclacitinib administration. Treatment was continued for 1 year. Complete blood count and serology were performed every 6 months during oclacitinib administration and parameters remained within the reference range. Oclacitinib might represent a safe alternative systemic treatment for pruritus in cases of acral lick dermatitis not responsive to other therapies or when adverse effects of treatment are unacceptable.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the inflammatory transcriptome of experimental acute canine AD lesions. Biopsies were collected 6, 24 and 48 h after epicutaneous application of Dermatophagoides farinae house dust mites to eight mite-sensitized Maltese beagle atopic dogs. We extracted mRNA from skin biopsies and the transcriptome was assessed using a dog-specific microarray. Gene expression of mite-challenged biopsies was compared to that of unchallenged specimens (1.5-fold change, 0.05 false discovery rate-corrected P-values). Acute canine atopic lesions had a significant upregulation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory (e.g. IL6, TNF), Thelper-(Th)2 (e.g. IL4, IL5, IL13, IL31, IL33 and others), Th9 (IL9) and Th22 (IL22) cytokines, as well as Th2 chemokines (e.g. CCL5, CCL17 and others). Surprisingly the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) was downregulated. There was also significant upregulation of genes encoding other known pruritogenic proteins and pathways, such as cathepsin S (CTSS), neuromedinB (NMB), nerve growth factor (NGF), leukotriene-synthesis enzymes (ALOX5, ALOX5AP, LTA4H), and the mast cell proteases chymase (CMA), tryptase and mastin. In conclusion, acute canine atopic skin lesions exhibit an upregulation of immunological and pruritogenic pathways that are very similar to those seen in human atopic skin. The successful treatment of AD lesions is likely to require inhibiting multiple rather than single pruritogenic and proinflammatory pathways.

Preliminary assessment of percutaneous (prick) test in dogs C. LORENTE* and P. RUIZ* *Centro Dermatolog""Ä±a Veterinaria ADERVET, Madrid, Spain Skin prick testing (SPT) is the standard method used to assess IgE hypersensitivity to allergens in atopic humans. The objective of this study was to assess the potential use of SPT in atopic dogs to identify allergen-specific hypersensitivity. SPT was performed without sedation on the inner thigh of 11 healthy dogs and 34 dogs with atopic dermatitis using prick lancets (Entaco; Worcestershire, UK). Glycerinated histamine (5 mg/mL) and saline solution (Diavet; Madrid) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Healthy dogs were then tested percutaneously with Dermatophagoides farinae, D. pteronyssinus, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, Acarus siro, Cupressus arizonica, Cynodon dactylon, Phleum pratense and Olea europea at concentrations of 0.01 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL (Diavet, Spain). None of the healthy dogs developed any reaction to any allergen. The allergen concentration of 10 mg/mL was selected for testing the 34 atopic dogs; 19 (56%) developed a wheal to at least one of the allergens tested within 7 minutes of SPT. Allergen-specific serum IgE was assessed in 25 of the 34 atopic dogs; of these, 3 dogs were negative on SPT and serology, 16 were positive on SPT and serology, and 6 were SPT negative and positive on serology. SPT was found to be an easy and rapid technique that could be used in outpatients. The positive reactions obtained in more than half of dogs with atopic dermatitis, but in none of the healthy dogs, suggests that SPT should be investigated further as a means to identify allergens for specific immunotherapy formulations.

6dfd1643a04ab678a8f24d3caadc9f13e5c427ac,A whole-blood transcriptome meta-analysis identifies gene expression signatures of cigarette smoking.,"Cigarette smoking is a leading modifiable cause of death worldwide. We hypothesized that cigarette smoking induces extensive transcriptomic changes that lead to target-organ damage and smoking-related diseases. We performed a meta-analysis of transcriptome-wide gene expression using whole blood-derived RNA from 10,233 participants of European ancestry in six cohorts (including 1421 current and 3955 former smokers) to identify associations between smoking and altered gene expression levels. At a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<0.1, we identified 1270 differentially expressed genes in current vs. never smokers, and 39 genes in former vs. never smokers. Expression levels of 12 genes remained elevated up to 30 years after smoking cessation, suggesting that the molecular consequence of smoking may persist for decades. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of smoking-related genes for activation of platelets and lymphocytes, immune response, and apoptosis. Many of the top smoking-related differentially expressed genes, including LRRN3 and GPR15, have DNA methylation loci in promoter regions that were recently reported to be hypomethylated among smokers. By linking differential gene expression with smoking-related disease phenotypes, we demonstrated that stroke and pulmonary function show enrichment for smoking-related gene expression signatures. Mediation analysis revealed the expression of several genes (e.g. ALAS2) to be putative mediators of the associations between smoking and inflammatory biomarkers (IL6 and C-reactive protein levels). Our transcriptomic study provides potential insights into the effects of cigarette smoking on gene expression in whole blood and their relations to smoking-related diseases. The results of such analyses may highlight attractive targets for treating or preventing smoking-related health effects.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tianxiao Huan"", ids = ""2789524""); list(name = ""Roby Joehanes"", ids = ""2770659""); list(name = ""Claudia Schurmann"", ids = ""4263469""); list(name = ""Katharina Schramm"", ids = ""18035502""); list(name = ""Luke C Pilling"", ids = ""5385990""); list(name = ""Marjolein J.

0c67f202f85dc508dd42420dff530f8ce467a9d8,Microarray analysis revealed that immunity-associated genes are primarily regulated by roxarsone in promoting broiler chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) growth.,"Addition of roxarsone can significantly improve the growth of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). Nevertheless, this application will lead to the contamination of the environment as well as animal products. Understanding the response of genes to roxarsone may bring about the discovery of new, safer substitutes. In this study, we monitored the expression of 8,935 genes in chicken breast muscle using microarrays. Analysis showed that 30 genes, such as the interleukin 3 regulated nuclear factor (NFIL3), the regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin-containing protein (RFXANK), the cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 3 (CPSF3), and the FK506 binding protein 9 (FKBP9), have consistently up or downregulated (fold change â‰¥1.5 or â‰¤0.6, P < 0.05, false discovery rate â‰¤0.05) throughout the medication periods. The results from microarray analysis were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Further functional investigation showed that 13 of the identified genes are well documented, and surprisingly, 11 (85%) of these are related to immunity (5 are immunity and defense related, 4 are immunodeficiency disease related, 2 are immunosuppressive drug related), and the remaining 2 are energy metabolism related. These findings may suggest that supplement of roxarsone can improve the immunity of chickens through regulating the expression of associated genes, and as a result contribute to the growth promotion. Further research on the encoded proteins of the differentially expressed genes should provide more evidence for the potential mechanism.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Changlu Li"", ids = ""21477286""); list(name = ""Xu Lan Wang"", ids = ""48631326""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""47576813""); list(name = ""C X Wu"", ids = ""145013025"")",afcfc80b77d240715431a12633b1cee527c05002; cd56f2621e7b92efae504a2f98d90293c32a1bc5; 1ac0f46eec9ae333fe9095df6633ac4e9d6cdade; b97d6d1dfcb1e89eb4e0ce13a595c4c053e76dab,f7185d09a832c4f271bb62aabd171838366e4114; 9c8673f3bb4fe47f5d9bedecc72a0e6f5ff0972e; 9d41595c55a759e61fca0627b4431a95aa95ab82; 31a925bbae8de2b4de9020e6d0b00a3325542e19; 06dae72dd9166c35af276cbb36b589d63bc6a6eb; ac3811e1d538c693a9d669efe4af529f38c3275f; 0250e061fddd5af4318439ad3152fda156c84838; a4f8c71ee941df0bc516aae3842ffea866013a21; e0aa1f1e52ff1e01bdb17a02b5a5f49af6383888; 8ac425e6b58004236f12923a3b17c47775aee225; 18435c441231563afe879deacb5753ad18dcb0e5; 300d85f7816539d5030ec371af4a24b445471f84; fa1570345c2a092892424f710cf2988769b4c478; ee89d421ebd0213ccf3066a8a9e55a0224871b5c; fc2daca4c96f96d48492e8cd3d9ac951fc9b487f; 5b172ec62be8ae385ee13971f6d9fb09e7493caf; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8ef92e7ef18e1bdf803e32d9c7c275bf03859db5; 5a29654df3da808b7c0105c14fa4f93a735a4944; f95a05aae27d63270d3d16697b21633b01d99a6b; 48362d3a3fe3dc201afa0c23d2c226f8e2ecf542; 273e580a8db68693217b663d08065efd0420e109; dce86148c1bb80defe511e92a46e4e526b8e22b5; bc16bfda34bfd48dbf5bbb3d3120a5dcc28b1673; 674de6d742bffd526cc074db9305c08c5f9172f7; a645122be2321c6dcfd9484141c1e69b5aff8656; fc3826184536ee6ae4a7397fee926439428c517b; 7b7720cdde57a8c023a9f2c3b2cceb614b152b40,Poultry science,91 12,"

6ae75c0506a0d7b61c850f581920e2144beb1ee1,A proteomic approach to understanding the pathogenesis of idiopathic macular hole formation,"Idiopathic macular holes (IMH) are full-thickness defects of retinal tissue that cause severe vision loss due to disruption of the anatomic fovea. Abnormal vitreous traction is involved in the formation of macular holes. Both glial cells and hyalocytes contribute to epiretinal membrane formation in IMH. In order to gain further insight into the pathophysiology of IMH, we conducted a discovery phase investigation of the vitreous proteome in four patients with macular holes and six controls using one-dimensional gel fractionation and liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry analyses on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. Of a total of 5912 vitreous proteins, 32 proteins had increased and 39 proteins had decreased expression in IMH compared with controls, using a false discovery rate approach with p value <Â 0.001 and q value <Â 0.05. IMH was associated with increased expression of proteins in the complement pathway, Î±-2-macroglobulin, a major inducer of MÃ¼ller glial cell migration, fibrinogen, and extracellular matrix proteins, and decreased expression of proteins involved in protein folding and actin filament binding.

4377620802ad94b5bdf997e8a52f0f05aab9d268,Methods for Optimizing Seed Mortality Experiments,"Abstract Experiments investigating mortality in the soil seedbank are aided by using only seeds that are initially viable and capable of remaining ungerminated (hereafter â€œpersistent seedsâ€). However, seed mortality experiments often use heterogeneous populations containing persistent, nonviable, and germinable individuals. In this investigation we developed and compared nondestructive tests for isolating persistent seeds of two weed species characterized by physical seed dormancy (dormancy imposed by a water-impermeable seed coat): velvetleaf and ivyleaf morningglory. Individual seeds were weighed, steeped in water (hereafter â€œsteepateâ€) for 48 h, and then assayed for imbibition. These seeds were then subjected to persistence assays conducted under controlled conditions (60 d in hydrated soil under 25/15 C day/night temperatures, 14-h photoperiod). Persistent seeds were less likely to imbibe and more likely to produce steepates with low electrical conductivity compared with germinable and nonviable seeds. For velvetleaf, persistent seeds were best segregated by comparing changes in steepate conductivity during 4 to 48 h of soaking, with the corresponding classification and regression tree (CART) model making few false discoveries (false discovery rate for persistence; FDRp â€Š=â€Š 8.6%, n â€Š=â€Š 93) and many true positive classifications (true positive rate for persistence; TPRp â€Š=â€Š 100%, n â€Š=â€Š 85). For ivyleaf morningglory, both a change in steepate conductivity from 4 to 48 h of soaking and imbibition status after soaking accurately separated persistent seeds (accuracy measures of corresponding CART models: FDRp â€Š=â€Š 5.6%, n â€Š=â€Š 150; TPRp â€Š=â€Š 100%, n â€Š=â€Š 142). Thus, for species with physical seed dormancy, we recommend use of steepate conductivity and imbibition status after soaking for isolation of persistent seeds. These seeds can then be used to optimize experiments on mortality in the soil seedbank. Nondestructive tests for isolating persistent seeds of species characterized by physiological seed dormancy require further research. Nomenclature: Ivyleaf morningglory, Ipomea hederacea Jacq.

f59d65e0e2bd78856ccd11114f6a01f882a3e59e,Simultaneous rank tests for detecting differentially expressed genes,"Rank tests are known to be robust to outliers and violation of distributional assumptions. Two major issues besetting microarray data are violation of the normality assumption and contamination by outliers. In this article, we formulate the normal theory simultaneous tests and their aligned rank transformation (ART) analog for detecting differentially expressed genes. These tests are based on the least-squares estimates of the effects when data follow a linear model. Application of the two methods are then demonstrated on a real data set. To evaluate the performance of the aligned rank transform method with the corresponding normal theory method, data were simulated according to the characteristics of a real gene expression data. These simulated data are then used to compare the two methods with respect to their sensitivity to the distributional assumption and to outliers for controlling the family-wise Type I error rate, power, and false discovery rate. It is demonstrated that the ART generally possesses the robustness of validity property even for microarray data with small number of replications. Although these methods can be applied to more general designs, in this article the simulation study is carried out for a dye-swap design since this design is broadly used in cDNA microarray experiments.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bo Li"", ids = ""33308873""); list(name = ""Hossein Mansouri"", ids = ""4626954"")",9253064c7f28a04aa2f6f79115c3262873951749,305765959db0d522238d96e84f7fc3a180ee2855; 9a5b1b495c09cf8d4713931f35357a7bee460b63; 7aa8ab130b923eb71295dac6303239dceb7301fe; 1b06514008b56d4f3468d284402bbdc0f1399acd; 5c0394a8130f4d686b4a578e5fcd895fabde498a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4d4b889b9244d391152a4aafe8f41e2bad302b88; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; eb93f58238204ce0669c62af94ded001a621b5e5; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; 466f0cedd8014da88e53a6205dccb00d1809fa08; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; a83fb0db04a8bcfee63a83de58a40fe645386c67; 45a9298e18ac5cc69d302fe59d5c6b30764f6e60; a5b76fa17917a8a2d07687e064c327a3056910a4; 75f8a4d7ed6a0f32fa098cac967de247938d9ce5; 1d2e55d466f8d8d7fcd8f8225b67502da6031cd6,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,86,959 - 972
666916a36ac6d90ee33706758b13c9f4c95546b0,Genome-wide analysis in a murine Dnmt1 knockdown model identifies epigenetically silenced genes in primary human pituitary tumors.,"DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands (CGI) is an epigenetic modification associated with inappropriate gene silencing in multiple tumor types. In the absence of a human pituitary tumor cell line, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the maintenance methyltransferase DNA methyltransferase (cytosine 5)-1 (Dnmt1) was used in the murine pituitary adenoma cell line AtT-20. Sustained knockdown induced reexpression of the fully methylated and normally imprinted gene neuronatin (Nnat) in a time-dependent manner. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) revealed that reexpression of Nnat was associated with partial CGI demethylation, which was also observed at the H19 differentially methylated region. Subsequent genome-wide microarray analysis identified 91 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in Dnmt1 knockdown cells (10% false discovery rate). The analysis showed that genes associated with the induction of apoptosis, signal transduction, and developmental processes were significantly overrepresented in this list (P < 0.05). Following validation by reverse transcription-PCR and detection of inappropriate CGI methylation by COBRA, four genes (ICAM1, NNAT, RUNX1, and S100A10) were analyzed in primary human pituitary tumors, each displaying significantly reduced mRNA levels relative to normal pituitary (P < 0.05). For two of these genes, NNAT and S100A10, decreased expression was associated with increased promoter CGI methylation. Induced expression of Nnat in stable transfected AtT-20 cells inhibited cell proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of array-based ""epigenetic unmasking"" in combination with Dnmt1 knockdown and reveals the potential of this strategy toward identifying genes silenced by epigenetic mechanisms across species boundaries.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kevin J.

6edc6e041cd6a95ccad961f6dc2c35de99d43494,"Novel genetic determinants of telomere length from a multi-ethnic analysis of 75,000 whole genome sequences in TOPMed","Telomeres shorten in replicating somatic cells and with age; in human leukocytes, telomere length (TL) is associated with a host of aging-related diseases1,2. To date, 16 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified twenty-three loci associated with leukocyte TL3â€“18, but prior studies were primarily in individuals of European and Asian ancestry and relied on laboratory assays including Southern Blot and qPCR to quantify TL. Here, we estimated TL bioinformatically, leveraging whole genome sequencing (WGS) of whole blood from n=75,176 subjects in the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program. We performed the largest multi-ethnic and only WGS-based genome-wide association analysis of TL to date. We identified 22 associated loci (p-value <5Ã—10âˆ’8), including 10 novel loci. Three of the novel loci map to genes involved in telomere maintenance and/or DNA damage repair: TERF2, RFWD3, and SAMHD1. Many of the 99 pathways identified in gene set enrichment analysis for the 22 loci (multiple-testing corrected false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05) pertain to telomere biology, including the top five (FDR<1Ã—10âˆ’9). Importantly, several loci, including the recently identified TINF2 and ATM6 loci, showed strong ancestry-specific associations.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Margaret Taub"", ids = ""1802332""); list(name = ""Jacqueline S.

71855e46267e683eb3252ca5240221160bd95b40,Differential Parameter Learning,"Background. Graphical models have gained significant attention as a tool for discovering and visualizing dependencies among variables in multivariate data. Recently, attention has been drawn to situations where domain experts are interested in differences between the dependency structures of different populations. (e.g. differences between regulatory networks of different species, or differences between dependency networks of diseased versus healthy populations). The standard method for recovering these differences is to learn the structures independently and then compare them naÃ¯vely. However, this method has achieved limited success in practice as it is prone to high false discovery rates. Aim. In this paper, we develop sample efficient estimators which learn the differential network with low false discovery rates. Data. We evaluate our proposed estimators on real-data where, given samples Escherichia Coli regulatory network under different conditions, the goal is to recover the change in the network. Methods. Our proposed estimators can be broadly classified into two categories; discriminative methods, which directly model the differential structure, and generative methods, which learn the structures independently, and control for false discovery rates by an additional step. Results. We show empirically that our proposed methods achieve higher precision than existing techniques. Conclusions. While in this paper we have focused on differential network analysis, the idea of differential learning can be generalized to learning semi-parametric models, where parameters of interest are plagued with nuisance parameters. Similar techniques could be used for differential feature selection to answer questions like â€œare there different bio-markers for cancer in men and women?â€, or for differential clustering to detect significant changes in cluster structures between populations.",2017,,"list(name = ""Adarsh Prasad"", ids = ""1963833"")",,e4f8536b067127e5269316832a4733def51c399a; 522eedc0256428a330f7d94b6d4f6154117e926e; 268a4f8da15a42f3e0e71691f760ff5edbf9cec8; a462ee3d64edf189e075451ca7cb728bcc9e5fb3; 0c57b6eaaf5543619c344b13b0e89568e4dc039a; 2cfcd6300b279c257a0ef29dd6997fdfe1172322; d6e813b6970755d0df7c8e1949d30238ff0fb05e; b17d15e0161a6f2b3de16a0a611a63e41a6f1ce9; f1545119be52d5229166663c2bfc5f4be48767db; 398ff09f1ef9fdc1d70f59eeb744f06c06998528; 618152676e49091c54a9ccaed493a6183603d520; a66fd5a19b687bcb39c5131a1619fa04ee5e785e; 4a0a106879b196eabeb0c298e6f415ddf168d529; 37753f4c81f27cd685f769fe3e9ef879f22f035e; 6a5192cd957e1278d93b8a0b957a047c17f45d92; 51b0cd65c6b0cb11cad68d0497fea3fff0913b98; 9e2cbaa3d04b4fa1e094700683e9daaa9ed64458; d8bc99dfd37e62ad1d70aac9bfc590b459ee029c,,,

Anifrolumab, a fully human, IgG1&kgr; monoclonal antibody against the type I IFN receptor, is in Phase III development for the treatment of moderate to severe SLE (NCT02446912 and NCT02446899). Objectives We sought to understand other molecular pathways (either dependent on or independent of type I IFN signaling), to elucidate heterogeneous mechanisms in SLE, and to identify patient subsets for personalized disease management. Methods Baseline blood samples from adult patients with moderate to severe SLE from two Phase IIb clinical studies (NCT01438489, N=265; NCT01283139, N=416) were profiled with whole genome array analyses. Type I IFN gene signature (IFNGS) test status was determined by a central laboratory utilizing an analytically validated four gene (IFI27, IFI44, IFI44L, RSAD2) quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based test from patients' whole blood. A predetermined, delta Ct-based cut-off point, in the trough of the bimodal distribution, was utilized to segregate type I IFNGS testâ€“high from â€“low patients at baseline. Blood from healthy controls was stimulated ex vivo with IFN-&bgr;, IFN-&ggr;, IFN-&lgr;, IFN-&ohgr;, or a pool of all IFN-&agr; subtypes, with or without blocking antibodies for each IFN type, to develop IFN-type-specific signatures. Cell type- and cytokine pathway-specific gene signatures derived from the literature were also evaluated with the Phase IIb sample data. A Fisher's exact test was used for enrichment calculations (signatures cut at median), and comparisons were adjusted for multiplicity through false discovery rate. Results A total of 79% of SLE patients in the combined study population had a type I IFNGS testâ€“high status. From the type I IFNGS testâ€“high patients, 29/95 signatures evaluated had significant enrichment, including those for B cells (q=1.17E-17, odds ratio [OR]=6.4), plasma cells (q=6.96E-11, OR=3.9), and CD40L signaling (q=1.07E-08, OR=3.3), relative to type I IFNGS testâ€“low patients. In contrast, type I IFNGS testâ€“low patients had enrichment for eosinophils (q=5.4E-6, OR=0.39) and type II IFN (IFN-&ggr;) specifically inducible gene signatures (q=4.6E-3, OR=0.47). These findings were significant for the combined study population, as well as for the NCT01438489 study population, and were either significant or trending for the NCT01283139 population (q<0.05). Conclusions SLE patients who are type I IFNGS testâ€“high had elevated concentrations of B cells, plasma cells, and other inflammatory cytokine pathways. Type I IFNGS testâ€“low patients, by contrast, were enriched for eosinophil and type II IFN pathways. These observations provide new insights into the molecular heterogeneity underlying SLE and suggest new therapeutic approaches, particularly for type I IFNGS testâ€“low patients.

2b88e35f7c561833dcdcbefbddd9bbd438622303,Controlling the Precision-Recall Tradeoff in Differential Dependency Network Analysis,"Graphical models have gained a lot of attention recently as a tool for learning and representing dependencies among variables in multivariate data. Often, domain scientists are looking specifically for differences among the dependency networks of different conditions or populations (e.g. differences between regulatory networks of different species, or differences between dependency networks of diseased versus healthy populations). The standard method for finding these differences is to learn the dependency networks for each condition independently and compare them. We show that this approach is prone to high false discovery rates (low precision) that can render the analysis useless. We then show that by imposing a bias towards learning similar dependency networks for each condition the false discovery rates can be reduced to acceptable levels, at the cost of finding a reduced number of differences. Algorithms developed in the transfer learning literature can be used to vary the strength of the imposed similarity bias and provide a natural mechanism to smoothly adjust this differential precision-recall tradeoff to cater to the requirements of the analysis conducted. We present real case studies (oncological and neurological) where domain experts use the proposed technique to extract useful differential networks that shed light on the biological processes involved in cancer and brain function.",2013,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Diane Oyen"", ids = ""2864621""); list(name = ""Alexandru Niculescu-Mizil"", ids = ""1399048849""); list(name = ""Rachel Ostroff"", ids = ""14533116""); list(name = ""Alex Stewart"", ids = ""46807928""); list(name = ""Vincent P.

69b78b24931da2040afa893cba095c6a0ed4cff4,Identification of proteins secreted by head and neck cancer cell lines using LC-MS/MS: Strategy for discovery of candidate serological biomarkers.,"In search of blood-based biomarkers that would enhance the ability to diagnose head and neck/oral squamous cell carcinoma (HNOSCC) in early stages or predict its prognosis, we analyzed the HNOSCC secretome (ensemble of proteins secreted and/or shed from the tumor cells) for potential biomarkers using proteomic technologies. LC-MS/MS was used to identify proteins in the conditioned media of four HNOSCC cell lines (SCC4, HSC2, SCC38, and AMOSIII); 140 unique proteins were identified on the basis of 5% global false discovery rate, 122 of which were secretory proteins, with 29 being previously reported to be overexpressed in HNOSCC in comparison to normal head and neck tissues. Of these, five proteins including Î±-enolase, peptidyl prolyl isomerase A/cyclophilin A, 14-3-3 Î¶, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K, and 14-3-3 Ïƒ were detected in the sera of HNOSCC patients by Western blot analysis. Our study provides the evidence that analysis of head and neck cancer cells' secretome is a viable strategy for identifying candidate serological biomarkers for HNOSCC. In future, these biomarkers may be useful in predicting the likelihood of transformation of oral pre-malignant lesions, prognosis of HNOSCC patients and evaluate response to therapy using minimally invasive tests.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ranju Ralhan"", ids = ""5341028""); list(name = ""Olena Masui"", ids = ""6904941""); list(name = ""Leroi V Desouza"", ids = ""5303472""); list(name = ""Ajay Matta"", ids = ""25312439""); list(name = ""Muzafar Ahmad Macha"", ids = ""11815164""); list(name = ""K.

5fa72953c73552c2c3c3baee74378b744d017833,DiffSplice: the genome-wide detection of differential splicing events with RNA-seq,"The RNA transcriptome varies in response to cellular differentiation as well as environmental factors, and can be characterized by the diversity and abundance of transcript isoforms. Differential transcription analysis, the detection of differences between the transcriptomes of different cells, may improve understanding of cell differentiation and development and enable the identification of biomarkers that classify disease types. The availability of high-throughput short-read RNA sequencing technologies provides in-depth sampling of the transcriptome, making it possible to accurately detect the differences between transcriptomes. In this article, we present a new method for the detection and visualization of differential transcription. Our approach does not depend on transcript or gene annotations. It also circumvents the need for full transcript inference and quantification, which is a challenging problem because of short read lengths, as well as various sampling biases. Instead, our method takes a divide-and-conquer approach to localize the difference between transcriptomes in the form of alternative splicing modules (ASMs), where transcript isoforms diverge. Our approach starts with the identification of ASMs from the splice graph, constructed directly from the exons and introns predicted from RNA-seq read alignments. The abundance of alternative splicing isoforms residing in each ASM is estimated for each sample and is compared across sample groups. A non-parametric statistical test is applied to each ASM to detect significant differential transcription with a controlled false discovery rate. The sensitivity and specificity of the method have been assessed using simulated data sets and compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental validation using qRT-PCR confirmed a selected set of genes that are differentially expressed in a lung differentiation study and a breast cancer data set, demonstrating the utility of the approach applied on experimental biological data sets.

898d7bd9e89c04f9b2f513fdd8b7d46ddfa8e8be,Identification of candidate tumor related genes using comprehensive gene expression analysis of neuroblastic tumors.,"9051 Background: Neuroblastic tumors (NBTs) represent a heterogeneous and relatively well defined spectrum of neoplastic diseases. We performed gene expression analysis to molecularly characterize the distinct clinicobiological subtypes of NBTs.


METHODS
Gene expression analysis of 106 NBTs (10 ganglioneuromas, 10 stage 4s, 29 loco-regional (stages 1, 2, 3), and 57 stage 4) and 12 neuroblastoma cell lines was performed using Affymetrix Genechip Human Genome U95 Set Arrays. Differential expression between predefined groups of biological and clinical relevance was determined by differences >3 standard deviations between the means for groups, step-down permutation and false discovery rate methods.


RESULTS
Gene expression analysis of clinically defined groups including stage 4 infants versus children, metastatic versus non metastatic, and stroma poor loco-regional versus stage 4, revealed that many differentially expressed genes mapped to chromosomal regions with well described recurrent abnormalities in NBTs (chromosomes 1, 11, 17, 19 and X). Pairwise comparison analysis of biologically defined groups, including triploid versus diploid/tetraploid NBTs, identified significantly discriminating genes that map to the same chromosomal regions. Gene expression analysis of MYCN-amplified versus MYCN non amplified NBTs, confirmed a functional overrepresentation for genes involved in protein biosynthesis.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression profile analysis of clinically and biologically relevant subgroups of NBTs revealed differential expression of genes at specific chromosomal regions known to have strong association between genetic alterations and NBT clinical features. The identification of altered expression helps to define critical chromosomal regions and identify tumor related candidate genes within each region.

We have optimized a procedure for growing Trypanosoma brucei procyclic form cells in conditions suitable for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) and report a comparative proteomic analysis of cultured procyclic form and bloodstream form T. brucei cells. In total we were able to identify 3959 proteins and quantify SILAC ratios for 3553 proteins with a false discovery rate of 0.01. A large number of proteins (10.6%) are differentially regulated by more the 5-fold between lifecycle stages, including those involved in the parasite surface coat, and in mitochondrial and glycosomal energy metabolism.

195f04a134af0f1d55be94c3b020e6764f9591b3,"Comment: Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model","Through his various examples, Professor Efron makes a convincing case that cutting-edge science requires methods for detecting multiple ""non-nulls."" These methods must be straightforward to implement, but perhaps more importantly statisticians need to be able to justify them unambiguously. Efron's Empirical Bayes approach is certainly computationally efficient, but we feel the rationale for making each of his steps is unattractively ad hoc. This concern is practical, not philosophical; Efron's criterion for choice of tuning parameters seems to be that they look ""believable."" In less expert hands, this approach seems to introduce a lot of leeway for practitioners to simply ""tune"" away until they get the results they want. In an attempt to address this problem, we will de scribe an approach developed in a fully model-based framework. As with locfdr, the calculations are fast, but our whole analysis derives from clear up-front statements about what the analysis is trying to achieve, and the modeling assumptions made. The results look reassuringly similar to Professor Efron's. We hope this will be helpful for understanding the current paper, and in making a contribution to this general field. We begin by following Efron in placing the local false discovery rate, fdr(z), as the primary focus of the analysis, and exploit the fact that it can offer a neat pa rameterization of the two-part model. If the marginal, ""mixture"" density for the z-values is",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kenneth L.

d57dd6786533d877e5f8b1290843d0376ddde68a,False discovery rates of protein identifications: a strike against the two-peptide rule.,"Most proteomics studies attempt to maximize the number of peptide identifications and subsequently infer proteins containing two or more peptides as reliable protein identifications. In this study, we evaluate the effect of this ""two-peptide"" rule on protein identifications, using multiple search tools and data sets. Contrary to the intuition, the ""two-peptide"" rule reduces the number of protein identifications in the target database more significantly than in the decoy database and results in increased false discovery rates, compared to the case when single-hit proteins are not discarded. We therefore recommend that the ""two-peptide"" rule should be abandoned, and instead, protein identifications should be subject to the estimation of error rates, as is the case with peptide identifications. We further extend the generating function approach (originally proposed for evaluating matches between a peptide and a single spectrum) to evaluating matches between a protein and an entire spectral data set.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nitin Gupta"", ids = ""145994225""); list(name = ""Pavel A.

ad9838aa187cef5ce2b30c97868c30ffab94f319,Quantitative clinical proteomic study of autopsied human infarcted brain specimens to elucidate the deregulated pathways in ischemic stroke pathology.,"UNLABELLED
Ischemic stroke, still lacking an effective neuroprotective therapy is the third leading cause of global mortality and morbidity. Here, we have applied an 8-plex iTRAQ-based 2D-LC-MS/MS strategy to study the commonly regulated infarct proteome from three different brain regions (putamen, thalamus and the parietal lobe) of female Japanese patients. Infarcts were compared with age-, post-mortem interval- and location-matched control specimens. The iTRAQ experiment confidently identified 1520 proteins with 0.1% false discovery rate. Bioinformatics data mining and immunochemical validation of pivotal perturbed proteins revealed a global failure of the cellular energy metabolism in the infarcted tissues as seen by the parallel down-regulation of proteins related to glycolysis, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The concomitant down-regulation of all participating proteins (SLC25A11, SLC25A12, GOT2 and MDH2) of malate-aspartate shuttle might be responsible for the metabolic in-coordination between the cytosol and mitochondria resulting in the failure of energy metabolism. The levels of proteins related to reactive gliosis (VIM, GFAP) and anti-inflammatory response (ANXA1, ANXA2) showed an increasing trend. The elevation of ferritin (FTL, FTH1) may indicate an iron-mediated oxidative imbalance aggravating the mitochondrial failure and neurotoxicity. The deregulated proteins could be useful as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for ischemic stroke.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Clinical proteomics of stroke has been lagging behind other areas of clinical proteomics like Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. Our study is the first quantitative clinical proteomics study where iTRAQ-2D-LC-MS/MS has been utilized in the area of ischemic stroke to obtain a comparative profile of human ischemic infarcts and age-, sex-, location- and post-mortem interval-matched control brain specimens. Different pathological attributes of ischemic stroke well-known through basic and pre-clinical research such as failure of cellular energy metabolism, reactive gliosis, activation of anti-inflammatory response and aberrant iron metabolism have been observed at the bedside. Our dataset could act as a reference for similar studies done in the future using ischemic brain samples from various brain banks across the world. A meta-analysis of these studies could help to map the pathological proteome specific to ischemic stroke that will guide the scientific community to better evaluate the pros and cons of the pre-clinical models for efficacy and mechanistic studies. Infarct being the core of injury should have the most intense regulation for several key proteins involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Hence, a part of the up-regulated proteome could leak into the general circulation that may offer candidates of interest as potential biomarkers. In support of our proposed hypothesis, we report ferritin in the current study as one of the most elevated proteins in the infarct, which has been documented as a biomarker in the context of ischemic stroke by an independent study. Overall, our approach has the potential to identify probable therapeutic targets and biomarkers in the area of ischemic stroke.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arnab Datta"", ids = ""28553664""); list(name = ""Hiroyasu Akatsu"", ids = ""5366445""); list(name = ""Klaus Heese"", ids = ""2726124""); list(name = ""Siu Kwan Sze"", ids = ""145270496"")",13ce1dfbd03a63c9d6ac333d4e1a9b0f655667a7; 4234bea2e34c0a9a232f7a89f05abdcb20b9421f; b5c7d1844c03dfbe9d4ce48066eeb068b1983650; 371419c099f65f55bd36ba2aa6ac05bc4c69c2d9; 3c060b48c11e64f25a828953c2ddc728772dbf4c; 92a07301576af15f15ff2b9342a9ef0f3a2e88d0; 612cbd5d0c7a5069c9c8b6d9816677377a51afba; 410992769dccdef27a48fdb8b1cf3141a50f3b59; 4d1b85f2073767cd2fc923b44030f629220a6131; 9d5c432d2b689578842e2c9333215e9e0c627107; 39e63cc72d47b568f2381406c9224ef5c4c3b0e6; a332d69a7037d07240021f544a26be9cdcaf09c0; c3835b4b0f54e6e5f8fd676af52cce68c18de1e0; d92ee306281d0c38ee487efbb994818ae5ab9183; ba5107a8e880d8d7dfd4b98f014bf4c7ab7e0ab7; 7784b6f772ed2adcc6c59f8040af5c9d7422043d; e8a086fa5b9bb004b3063ceea07165ce7bc19746; cf2a076756be4ebe3d2bc16736740eeaa93c2d3e,c8a575eb6be67a9bf926e555e21c41ae598ac859; 6bfb75dbdb65a3aad0bc1a8153f2bf762f7bf98c; bedf4d97bfa2ce6600abd4cf3a64cfe5010ebe3e; c82f29ad020140fcda8ce47223a20d0f65d4b3c1; 13b87e6787dce64d550f0bbf0cd4a22038cb911a; 0a609bc008052f8fd944be13b0f35c6f598b044e; bc929013dd3fbf1d150aa7dbebff7f4167a28a0a; 4c935e76d7296152641fa3506cad73d4180c1bcb; e033c36427647b58fc63baad03d8b87bae602975; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 85675f464599530e0cf6612991f6bb498e4e8574; cb2d1de994b642c14076bcc9d99971d106f59fa6; 4db4d85ba35d4904bee05bcf53e027cf7ac74ea8; 1ce3665a7545af06860046aad02526e058a884d4; f3cfa88e805f464661e2102413f8e50f3c7233c4; 3063eac36267d0c9e4e09f5f80e741ac3a7fdb25; 514e066bb887ed19acd2c8ec60270fe3a1e938e4; 9c04373e2149ef6a678138aa35edf8799d49b291; d0c0174feb5c7642d51b4771dbb5c4cde39fb3f0; 60e48f4059114bb288f523ce97bd4e487fb6a6cb; 79ab3e8a3bfef22bc21f3c08dfc5cd9b7b632d3b; 0e3a15e4c5fd55aa72ae3ef2319c95a7f65f6aa2; ecbb9337f961a75f581f15541c150356296acdb1; 7289f6ccbe433da35bd8b14fb782b665af909b46; b3e1705716a12a2cea281dbd4bab6aa13b6d8b87; 4e57640ba6a0fae9314a39a61d6d8fc2642edbfd; 1dc24ed92b9f93e2ad1802f70e9c1ef4c9514a47; 79b59fe0a23aa9b05fee9a2df8630b99330ff910; 8710e6625e6f8b1d54486b8607bd172336d21b80; a4dd806305d1a54da520aea82fbfcaf19772e720; 41934d06106a87a8c899d58ed91c7787d167fb4d; 6fbed6c0ecc3a7170f6f14bec44b43d11f55dfa5; 512c4de376f2f8ca78afa34521ef37a486f305b9; 7281cf7e4e92f30fb3fd1822f6568ba56fa7781c; efae5eaf835fb881ab57ad4cebf2276587b912a2; 7609cf243fef9dff59b6db16184d9fdb05f53791; 93456b23cd35cc749360b73d097fe3f43f63a741; 444f7c741c200a08dd7f198b427377c551bbbac4; 69de1d75957eecf10f5cb56762c09b5182487e2e; b42f1f7fa76d304452b68f00b7ccc44a7c084c54; 80f735f9b96c78d7603591bb492c49c5386e4c70; 1c4fd52ea7f3d800a80703be77788422b7183bb6; e35d82f7f824e3a7b042bf809a9b2379113d9c2b; 7bad00c1a00c5e8d1b6cf2ac16305ade56cf0b40; d36704a62f18ed4b65d4921cc56c4f7ec9fb6f91,Journal of proteomics,91,"

fcd02c2afe32334eed63168cea24de954deb8062,[Role of miR-106b-5p in the regulation of gene profiles in endothelial cells].,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the role of miR-106b-5p in the regulation of gene expression in endothelial cells.


METHODS
The Taqman low-density microRNAs (miRNAs) array (TLDA) was used to identify miRNA expression profiles in the plasma of patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) (atherosclerosis group, n=9) and individuals without atherosclerotic CAD disease (control group, n=9). A weighed and undirected miRNA coexpression network analysis was performed to investigate the interactions among miRNAs in the two groups. MiR-106b-5p, whose coexpression pattern in atherosclerosis group was most different from that of control group, was further studied. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were transfected with miR-106b-5p mimic or negative control mimic, and Affymetrix GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 was used to screen the differential gene expression profiles after transfection. And the signal transduction pathway of differential gene profiles was further analyzed in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway database. After parsing the whole KEGG database, all differentially expressed genes involved pathways were extracted, and the hypergeometric distribution was used to calculate the pathway enrichment.


RESULTS
The coexpression pattern of the patients with atherosclerosis (140 nodes, 1 154 edges) differed from that of the non-atherosclerosis control group (140 nodes, 612 edges). The analysis of array data with significant analysis of microarray (SAM) identified 746 significantly deregulated genes (fold change â‰¥ 1.5 and false discovery rate < 0.01) altered by overexpression of miR-106b-5p with miR-106b-5p mimic in HUVEC. By calculating the pathway enrichment, we found that multiple signaling pathways enriched in differential gene profiles were closely related to the process of formation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque, including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), toll like receptor (TLR) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±) and other signal pathways.


CONCLUSION
The coexpression pattern of miRNAs in plasma of patients with atherosclerosis is more significantly changed than that of individuals without atherosclerotic disease. MiR-106b-5p, which shows the most significant difference between groups, targets multiple signal pathways in vascular endothelial cells, and might play an important role in the regulatory network of atherosclerotic gene expression.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jingqi Zhang"", ids = ""50859769""); list(name = ""Song Feng Li"", ids = ""40081579""); list(name = ""Hong Chen"", ids = ""14499254""); list(name = ""Jung-Sub Song"", ids = ""93815764"")",,,Beijing da xue xue bao.

eb3d9bbb47a31404a8e574a38a79f84ba288f141,Effect of continuous light on diurnal rhythms in Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142,"BackgroundLife on earth is strongly affected by alternating day and night cycles. Accordingly, many organisms have evolved an internal timekeeping system with a period of approximately 24 hours. Cyanobacteria are the only known prokaryotes with robust rhythms under control of a central clock. Numerous studies have been conducted to elucidate components of the circadian clock and to identify circadian-controlled genes. However, the complex interactions between endogenous circadian rhythms and external cues are currently not well understood, and a direct and mathematical based comparison between light-mediated and circadian-controlled gene expression is still outstanding. Therefore, we combined and analyzed data from two independent microarray experiments, previously performed under alternating light-dark and continuous light conditions in Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, and sought to classify light responsive and circadian controlled genes.ResultsFourier Score-based methods together with random permutations and False Discovery Rates were used to identify genes with oscillatory expression patterns, and an angular distance based criterion was applied to recognize transient behaviors in gene expression under constant light conditions. Compared to previously reported mathematical approaches, the combination of these methods also facilitated the detection of modified amplitudes and phase-shifts of gene expression. Our analysis showed that the majority of diurnally regulated genes, essentially those genes that are maximally expressed during the middle of the light and dark period, are in fact light responsive. In contrast, most of the circadian controlled genes are up-regulated during the beginning of the dark or subjective dark, and are greatly enriched for genes associated with energy metabolism. Many of the circadian controlled and light responsive genes are found in gene clusters within the Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 genome. Interestingly, in addition to cyclic expression patterns with a period of 24 hours, we also found several genes that oscillate with an ultradian period of 12 hours, a novel finding among cyanobacteria.ConclusionWe demonstrate that a combination of different analytical methods significantly improved the identification of cyclic and transient gene expression in Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. Our analyses provide an adaptable and novel analytical tool to study gene expression in a variety of organisms with diurnal, circadian and ultradian behavior.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thanura R.

c2fa495ef43dc0fc032b2c45ed997e3538594c86,Implementing false discovery rate control: increasing your power,"Popular procedures to control the chance of making type I errors when multiple statistical tests are performed come at a high cost: a reduction in power. As the number of tests increases, power for an individual test may become unacceptably low. This is a consequence of minimizing the chance of making even a single type I error, which is the aim of, for instance, the Bonferroni and sequential Bonferroni procedures. An alternative approach, control of the false discovery rate (FDR), has recently been advocated for ecological studies. This approach aims at controlling the proportion of significant results that are in fact type I errors. Keeping the proportion of type I errors low among all significant results is a sensible, powerful, and easy-to-interpret way of addressing the multiple testing issue. To encourage practical use of the approach, in this note we illustrate how the proposed procedure works, we compare it to more traditional methods that control the familywise error rate, and we discuss some recent useful developments in FDR control.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Koen J F Verhoeven"", ids = ""5043640""); list(name = ""Katy L.

2e4f4eac0ee41d18a11e0deec57d2efbb039a82d,Abstract P5-18-01: TransHERA: The cell cycle regulator p27 predicts benefit from trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive early breast cancer patients treated within the HERA trial,"Purpose: Predictive biomarkers may help predicting adjuvant trastuzumab response and thus optimize the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic/predictive value of various biomarkers involved in cell cycle regulation or proliferation. Methods: Expression of p27, cyclin D1, TOP2a, and Ki67 was immunohistochemically determined in tissue micro arrays of specimens from 862 patients randomized to the trastuzumab (1 or 2 year; N=561) and observation (N=301) arms of the HERA trial. The primary endpoint of the analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Biomarker expression status was determined as continuous variable or by pre-defined categories. The interaction terms between the four biomarkers and treatment were assessed in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for variables of clinical interest. Associations were considered significant only if the false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-values remained significant. Results: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two study arms. A total of 249 DFS events (28.9%) were observed in the TransHERA cohort, with an overall 8-year DFS of 70.5% (95% CI 67.2%-73.5%). None of the four biomarkers was significantly associated with DFS in the total study population. When biomarkers were categorized according to pre-defined cut-off levels, only p27 turned out to be highly predictive: Expression data for p27 were available in 753 TransHERA patients. A highly significant interaction was detected between p27 and treatment when adjusting for clinical parameters and the remaining three biomarkers (p=0.0039). For patients classified as p27 low (â‰¤70% p27-positive tumor cells; N=318), a significant treatment effect was observed, with the hazard of a DFS event being greater for the observation group compared to patients treated with trastuzumab (HR Trast vs Obs =0.43, 95% CI 0.29-0.64, p Trast vs Obs =0.97, 95% CI 0.66-1.44, p=0.89), indicating that p27 high patients derived little or no benefit from trastuzumab treatment. Cyclin D1, TOP2a, and Ki67 used as categorical variables were not predictive, while cyclin D1 used as continuous variable was predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit. Conclusion: HER2-positive early breast cancer patients with low p27 expression in their tumors appear to benefit from trastuzumab treatment, whereas patients with high p27 expression do not.

6ec0e7b3763c326109330e36b162e326fd373f8f,False Discovery Rate Approach to Unsupervised Image Change Detection,"In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised change detection on two or more coregistered images of the same object or scene at several time instants. We propose a novel empirical-Bayesian approach that is based on a false discovery rate formulation for statistical inference on local patch-based samples. This alternative error metric allows to efficiently adjust the family-wise error rate in case of the considered large-scale testing problem. The designed change detector operates in an unsupervised manner under the assumption of the limited amount of changes in the analyzed imagery. The detection is based on the use of various statistical features, which enable the detector to address application-specific detection problems provided an appropriate ad hoc feature choice. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the rank-based statistics: Wilcoxon and CrameÌr-von Mises for image pairs, and multisample Levene statistic for short image sequences. The experiments with remotely sensed radar, dermatological, and still camera surveillance imagery demonstrate accurate performance and flexibility of the proposed method.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vladimir A.

Oocytes from ovaries with fewer than 10 mid-antral follicles of 2 to 6â€‰mm in diameter (low group) show reduced competence compared with those from ovaries with more than 10 follicles (high group). To unravel mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, this work explored the role of follicular fluid microRNAs (miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level). A total of 3 pools of 300â€‰ÂµL of follicular fluid (FF) were collected from mid-antral follicles of low (L) and high (H) groups, respectively. Following miRNA extraction and library preparation, deep sequencing was carried out on Illumina HisEqn 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified with R package edgeR (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html). Target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted with DIANA miRPath using homologous human miRNA and gene union options (Pâ€‰ â€‰0.05). We found that 27 miRNAs were differentially expressed (false discovery rate â‰¤0.001): 17 were up-regulated in L and 10 in H. Up-regulated miRNAs in L group were predicted to target 121 genes, 39 of which are specific for ovarian function (e.g. BCL2, FOXO3, KIT, TP53, and PTK2). The GO analysis indicated that these genes were kinases, anti-apoptotic and oncogenic factors, and enriched stress-activated MAPK cascade mediated by oxygen reactive species, G1/S transition checkpoint, cellular response to interleukin-1, and negative regulation of cellular adhesion. Overexpressed miRNAs in H group were predicted to target 92 genes, 22 of which (e.g. MAPK, APC, JNK, PKA) are involved in folliculogenesis. These genes were represented by kinases, apoptotic and cytoskeleton remodelling factors, and enriched very important ovarian processes such as cell cycle, ephrin receptor, smoothened and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity GO processes. Only 7 target genes were common between the 2 groups, 2 of which were important in ovarian functionality (CDKN1A and ITGA5). Interestingly, overexpressed miRNAs in both groups regulate several genes involved in processes apparently not related to folliculogenesis. Finally, regulation can be exerted also by low levels of specific miRNAs such as miR-320, which was reduced in L group and is known to be associated with premature ovarian senescence in women and decreased developmental potential of mouse oocytes. Our results indicate that the different oocyte quality is associated with a different miRNA blueprint, which may alter the expression of several genes relevant for intra- and extra-ovarian processes. Further studies will be necessary to determine if FF miRNAs can act outside the ovary and if their levels can be detected in the bloodstream thereby becoming possible noninvasive, real-time markers to determine oocyte quality in living animals.

3327d7d9f73519ba361b9fcbac41bd238f9b1604,Preoperative gene expression may be associated with neurocognitive decline after cardiopulmonary bypass.,"OBJECTIVE
Despite advances in surgical techniques, neurocognitive decline after cardiopulmonary bypass remains a common and serious complication. We have previously demonstrated that patients with neurocognitive decline have unique genetic responses 6 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass when compared with normal patients. We used genomic microarray to objectively investigate whether patients with neurocognitive decline had associated preoperative gene expression profiles and how these profiles changed up to 4 days after surgery.


METHODS
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery underwent neurocognitive assessments preoperatively and 4 days after surgery. Skeletal muscle was collected intraoperatively. Whole blood collected before cardiopulmonary bypass, 6 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass, and on postoperative day 4 was hybridized to Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, Calif). Gene expression in patients with neurocognitive decline was compared with gene expression in the normal group using JMP Genomics (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Only genes that were commonly expressed in the 2 groups with a false discovery rate of 0.05 and a fold change greater than 1.5 were carried forward to pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, Calif). Microarray gene expression was validated by Green real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.


RESULTS
Neurocognitive decline developed in 17 of 42 patients. A total of 54,675 common transcripts were identified on microarray in each group across all time points. Preoperatively, there were 140 genes that were significantly altered between the normal and neurocognitive decline groups (PÂ <Â .05). Pathway analysis demonstrated that preoperatively, patients with neurocognitive decline had increased regulation in genes associated with inflammation, cell death, and neurologic dysfunction. Of note, the number of significantly regulated genes between the 2 groups changed over each time point and decreased from 140 preoperatively to 64 six hours after cardiopulmonary bypass and to 25 four days after surgery. There was no correlation in gene expression between the blood and the skeletal muscle.


CONCLUSIONS
Patients in whom neurocognitive decline developed after cardiopulmonary bypass had increased differential gene expression before surgery versus patients in whom neurocognitive decline did not develop. Although significant differences in gene expression also existed postoperatively, these differences gradually decreased over time. Preoperative gene expression may be associated with neurologic injury after cardiopulmonary bypass. Further investigation into these genetic pathways may help predict patient outcome and guide patient selection.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashraf A.

9fbd542c5bd636e07edde2b8ac4e60ed12b06896,Allelic Variation in a Cellulose Synthase Gene (PtoCesA4) Associated with Growth and Wood Properties in Populus tomentosa,"Lignocellulosic biomass from trees provides a renewable feedstock for biofuels, lumber, pulp, paper, and other uses. Dissecting the mechanism underlying natural variation of the complex traits controlling growth and lignocellulose biosynthesis in trees can enable marker-assisted breeding to improve wood quality and yield. Here, we combined linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based association analysis with traditional linkage analysis to detect the genetic effect of a Populus tomentosa cellulose synthase gene, PtoCesA4. PtoCesA4 is strongly expressed in developing xylem and leaves. Nucleotide diversity and LD in PtoCesA4, sampled from the P. tomentosa natural distribution, revealed that PtoCesA4 harbors high single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity (Ï€T = 0.0080 and Î¸w = 0.0098) and low LD (r(2) â‰¥ 0.1, within 1400 bp), demonstrating that the potential of a candidate-gene-based LD approach in understanding the molecular basis underlying quantitative variation in this species. By combining single SNP, multi-SNP, and haplotype-based associations in an association population of 460 individuals with single SNP linkage analysis in a family-based linkage populations (1200 individuals), we identified three strong associations (false discovery rate Q < 0.05) in both populations. These include two nonsynonymous markers (SNP49 associated with Î±-cellulose content and SNP59 associated with fiber width) and a noncoding marker (SNP18 associated with Î±-cellulose content).

1e0b783122d6a0f125d4e837517879c3833d27f6,Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal,"Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal can involve a large number of hypotheses. For instance, two satellite images of the same scene, taken before and after an event, could be used to test a hypothesis that the event has no environmental impact. This is equivalent to testing that the mean di erence of \after before"" is zero at each of the (typically thousands of) pixels that make up the scene. In such a situation, conventional testing procedures that control the overall Type I error deteriorate as the number of hypotheses increase. Powerful testing procedures are needed for this problem of testing for the presence of a spatial signal. In this article, we propose a procedure called Enhanced FDR (EFDR), which is based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and a concept known as generalized degrees of freedom (GDF). EFDR di ers from the standard FDR procedure through its reducing of the number of hypotheses tested. This is done in two ways: rst, the model is represented more parsimoniously in the wavelet domain, and second, an optimal selection of hypotheses is made using a criterion based on generalized degrees of freedom. Not only does the EFDR procedure tell us whether a spatial signal is present or not, it has an added bonus that, if a signal is deemed present, it can indicate its location and magnitude. We examine EFDR's operating characteristics, and in simulations we show that it outperforms the standard FDR and conventional testing procedures. Finally, the EFDR procedure is applied to an air-temperature data set generated from the Climate System Model (CSM) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), where air temperatures in the 1980s are compared to those in the 1990s. We conclude that temperature change has occurred between the two decades, mostly warming in the central part of the USA and in coastal regions of South America at about 20oS.",2001,,"list(name = ""Xiaotong Shen"", ids = ""2266946""); list(name = ""Hsin-Cheng Huang"", ids = ""3252021"")",08e9d012c99da90c76f92cd0ad1ebea477338c5f; 1db020274f29dd2d716a6a382cd119ece1ff33d9; 329df162dfbd1616cc961eeedd60c459a94472c1; 130b8ab3faa6d469ce0b56ce7e92ca8f70282794,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9c9293d0b307bfcc7f9a55708e7b2f07a8c43c0a; aef90e0ac203322bc18c4b88fcddc0e12ba5c080; 176f443abf525d7dae09f8f5ef5925b17be140d8; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; 80a1358d1d7cb14c33449275a1d4ef723c223691; 47865b56fee61d9c9ff477f7c79f090cc6663d3a; d3352e10caa42efae2f60710c668a455ffdb8884; af56f15bf6515b728edf24e3b9abdbdac28f23b7; 4286db547a55ec49c57f5213c75937de240ebc95; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; c7b620cb76265a0d3f6664b3aca69922bcb1ce1b; aed0004e4d52d48ff39681fd0bb6b5483608b00a; c51813780c2b9cb628c7bf92339fd828af21d61b; c473167e4c49287b13a51035335f7993c3b102fc; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; e32a28a248d832f670ca904f3de76173e0c33fb9; 60ca0e6986b4c52cd9ee2495bb644d8a7eb24fd8; f37edd6f5ecdd46bdc424eaa01b82c1558363d00; 0a429b76b0b7e728f2084145d1f68b8edfa258af; 934e6514d5d2ca29bb36664c34b05879a42ef1cd; b78626ce1a562c05b1c06f9c805e839f9760b9ab; 957e9f576b00c85dec4f7aed3938869c145cbbab; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 2c607824d7be660e9e73598fc8d626f29e17c98f; 3c87fe9db76dee3d6c0f49158c225bdb8a7e6ecd; 6526702cd0ff099a3922a415fc8e4b0af53839dc; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; e6d2035de7d49d85e63ce31bf7636fb818482f49; f5061e45e173b3556722e859f8f3b14023e1ccca; 93c6e84247d56cec5479488998481c9f3f825e66,,,
242c63063a9a390787386f58a0db2c0dcff81824,Are networks for residual language function and recovery consistent across aphasic patients?,"Objectives:If neuroplastic changes in aphasia are consistent across studies, this would imply relatively stereotyped mechanisms of recovery which could guide the design of more efficient noninvasive brain stimulation treatments. To address this question, we performed a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of chronic aphasia after stroke. Methods:Functional neuroimaging articles using language tasks in patients with chronic aphasia after stroke (n = 105) and control subjects (n = 129) were collected. Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis determined areas of consistent activity in each group. Functional homology between areas recruited by aphasic patients and controls was assessed by determining whether they activated under the same experimental conditions. Results:Controls consistently activated a network of left hemisphere language areas. Aphasic patients consistently activated some spared left hemisphere language nodes, new left hemisphere areas, and right hemisphere areas homotopic to the control subjects' language network. Patients with left inferior frontal lesions recruited right inferior frontal gyrus more reliably than those without. Some areas, including right dorsal pars opercularis, were functionally homologous with corresponding control areas, while others, including right pars triangularis, were not. Conclusions:The network of brain areas aphasic patients recruit for language functions is largely consistent across studies. Several recruitment mechanisms occur, including persistent function in spared nodes, compensatory recruitment of alternate nodes, and recruitment of areas that may hinder recovery. These findings may guide development of brain stimulation protocols that can be applied across populations of aphasic patients who share common attributes.

Capillary hypoperfusion is reported in asymptomatic adults at-risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the extent that can be explained by reduced flow in intracranial arteries is unknown.


METHODS
One hundred fifty-five asymptomatic adults enriched for AD risk (mean age 61 years) completed arterial spin labeling (pcASL) and 4D-flow MRI sequences. Voxel-wise regression models investigated the relationship between mean flow in bilateral cerebral arteries and capillary perfusion, and tested potential moderators of this relationship.


RESULTS
Mean arterial blood flow through middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) and internal carotid arteries was positively associated with perfusion in large cortical clusters (PÂ <Â .05, false discovery rate corrected). Trends were observed for the interactions MCA flow Ã— age and MCA flow Ã— cardiovascular risk on cerebral perfusion (PÂ <Â .001, uncorrected).


DISCUSSION
These findings provide evidence that capillary perfusion measured via pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling is strongly dependent on inflow from larger cerebral arteries. Further studies are warranted to investigate possible alterations between macrovascular and microvascular flow in advanced age and elevated cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic adults at risk for AD.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lindsay R.

490ef08718cf36d03bf6c5da449bd06028d1bdf7,Association of interleukin 23 receptor polymorphisms with anti-topoisomerase-I positivity and pulmonary hypertension in systemic sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE
IL23R has been identified as a susceptibility gene for development of multiple autoimmune diseases. We investigated the possible association of IL23R with systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease that leads to the development of cutaneous and visceral fibrosis.


METHODS
We tested 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in IL23R for association with SSc in a cohort of 1402 SSc cases and 1038 controls. IL23R SNP tested were previously identified as SNP showing associations with inflammatory bowel disease.


RESULTS
Case-control comparisons revealed no statistically significant differences between patients and healthy controls with any of the IL23R polymorphisms. Analyses of subsets of SSc patients showed that rs11209026 (Arg381Gln variant) was associated with anti-topoisomerase I antibody (ATA)-positive SSc (p = 0.001)) and rs11465804 SNP was associated with diffuse and ATA-positive SSc (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0026, respectively). These associations remained significant after accounting for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. Wild-type genotype at both rs11209026 and rs11465804 showed significant protection against the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT). (p = 3x10(-5), p = 1x10(-5), respectively).


CONCLUSION
Polymorphisms in IL23R are associated with susceptibility to ATA-positive SSc and protective against development of PHT in patients with SSc.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sandeep K Agarwal"", ids = ""32945979""); list(name = ""Pravitt Gourh"", ids = ""6203335""); list(name = ""Sanjay Shete"", ids = ""2251177""); list(name = ""Gene Paz"", ids = ""40129739""); list(name = ""Dipal Divecha"", ids = ""6281908""); list(name = ""John D.

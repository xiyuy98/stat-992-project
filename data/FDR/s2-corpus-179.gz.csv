4a6d28de2006c36cd54b2de7f14a87921e69a974,Signiï¿½cance ï¿½ests inMotiï¿½ ï¿½haracteriï¿½ation and Prediction,"Position weight matrix (PWM) is not only one of the most widely used bioinformatic methods, but also a key component in more advanced computational algorithms (e.g., Gibbs sampler) for characterizing and discovering motifs in nucleotide or amino acid sequences. However, few generally applicable statistical tests are available for evaluating the signiï¿½cance of site patterns, PWM, and PWM scores (PWMS) of putative motifs. Statistical signiï¿½cance tests of the PWM output, that is, site-speciï¿½c frequencies, PWM itself, and PWMS, are in disparate sources and have never been collected in a single paper, with the consequence that many implementations of PWM do not include any signiï¿½cance test. Here I review PWM-based methods used in motif characterization and prediction (including a detailed illustration of the Gibbs sampler for de novo motif discovery), present statistical and probabilistic rationales behind statistical signiï¿½cance tests relevant to PWM, and illustrate their application with real data. î¢e multiple comparison problem associated with the test of site-speciï¿½c frequencies is best handled by false discovery rate methods. î¢e test of PWM, due to the use of pseudocounts, is best done by resampling methods. î¢e test of individual PWMS for each sequence segment should be based on the extreme value distribution.",2012,,"list(name = ""Xuhua Xia"", ids = ""1976568"")",,61922aa47f40be64e1b444d73f9a9058c87fef7a; 42f3486128a5e5be1db9a8fe9a124e43f602a5c8; fb04e214da3820c1ea8decfcf81735a1a859d7f5; 4eca14cdddd8fcaf64fcccdbd98ea60cacbf1d12; eb336382cba4943e31b45237beb581b41359ebb0; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; debf77cf766ed93adfe34bafe3c63540a29a1e78; defc464f4eebffdcda2299c43c8d8d0367274727; bab30b392195a2b848f350fe897efa9d19dc5be5; 296e275b6aae81a508d925835d6617c499fbe0ec; 785eeacc47bda94fdf2f985e5486e6ed2ff11e6c; a7cf0f22bcb62a9df12d69cea0837c112010d9e2; 75fe0b74c5691a51c55ec6b1db2c56f3c21cc722; 6f961c7f32d2dd86922049f1a431ddc368f820dd; 61d1fbeeade46bbf558f3bfa614a57f7507cf668; d898ec0f0f8d952297e58e6288ff5e042d2bcac4; 87cbed883368d4a9efd42fdd91f47038f8d8fbe6; 964404598b566ba2aea0c098199901d3092496ff; cca43484af5ccb8a1210b334c95d283e8ba7fa38; 7a7ef576e1f894fcf05586c31a64f9591352c10c; d0141f35beeeff59c32bcc39d03445d86dfa798f; 232e9ff94740b8c0b9fafe22dcb3d26e303a79f4; e9ea5d69006a873641da93bcee4ec44f4cd598b0; 8a8d57b4a90d32c067211a440041321455f77c76; 66d2cfb6ef7a32ea4d9e2392d6cc1d0da49f2801; e2f64556ad275eb596b3e1ded98424630cc699aa; 9a2ed23c252d3d8cfac42b5275a0e3dee2532d3a; 42cf86b0e935089274759594140e6ab4cd344723; d403e3b41674381603731f9caff65cc358d45435; b3315db892f5e0c0b355ca2257438b186c3788a7; c2bf600d7e6adf5ed13dd9fda113ee46b1978833; 2d514097eb35f7f54ee7b1bbf01ef9e48fef5894; f68d23a2c975389b3e3e3de01dba20700fcc682a; b4c953ed2ff4bd68cc131aa19b796523a003a0e3; 1ca791c6eb8cb27f3d08fd4b707ca26beaeadb80; 2ed7a678a8d4c4750b5c5edb973f3f70701b69a8; 81a1bbd539ff5a041edec9ce07172ece6910b9fb; 75ca252b6c7226f0ff978b3c695f200748fb0536; 38c3bb252ba829878cea31d5cfae3513e6f3db1d; 375e6594512aaece76e3a7deb0fef98dc9d1ba52; 4965c82fe608a246d0304023aa16fb16b989a623; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 46c6ed3a56cfa3bb5c77907659b13b6609168d62; 860df3846270b87ece0d6dfab7d790acf6bdd96b; dd39ff24e33835fbd52cef69a7e23ab2f08f3cea; 5280740e3ca6f70b121f9a7c360d8fbec16b4b62; 83b4f02e5f9fffa9170ebc7e260ff70ebeea37ef; 4b766d2f75874135a079635a236a0eacd8d2ea9b; ee9d3156aea7130c4078560bd29fe89652c3ead9; b212d42744bdab39b3feda338e864e11591dbf11; daa75b6ea2c902d438a5c075761b1555003afc16; bdb4a67b8e83de538965181f27bc070e68ced84c; 787de3a9a00b44545272968c3a9333f4f8cb9716; 1186e5b5df2112e6b43ef1efdc1bd42327e61b0b; 448215a03f8aac5a7bbbc6329ec8b5e3f0ef033e; 780e5c08928452e96f9532022b8f82155111ea61; fd8890ee02077a89979a66ab34953aad96a1ded0; 459b30a9a960080f3b313e41886b1aa0e51e882c; 2d6fbea145ad931875cef922393145c4277fb3f6; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; 778e0a4789266e31fd9bcc1397e23694f766a0f6; afd3a135cd689b386f0b7d2bc962e3aaddf09b9a; 70d108b9eb2e3106d1f10413421f6c0a94150621; 9f33ae0160e3aa0c7fe9f645b9e9b2a92966f9cb; ebe3cb47ca8d40346fbcf6899d297c49d0713035; 2ca8198be18d3798a35bc483d9ac2f503ecc5064; b174273c1eb06c93abf7140bae42dd6c0c5889fb; b753cb08a8da0704510148124893770585ea0c7d; af05966c4cc5931a6d92c5a4987aa39efa758a2f; 16169212610b6a946167faa57a4c9efbb11a199c; ace33990a2f1b91d573810f28a28eca26976eb7e; 666e28e3fdfc1f156101947d0cd3c6bff7626407; 48ba05a463d2121e1d73188ac9231f60e63ea849; c86b0c302af3b3b980da8ae603c277e18de3b943; aa258c60361c42e6fe714216a61b36284f42f796; d127e2d0c1927252afba85006db69ce4fab6b2c4; 56bf2161be4bfbe6e6a08ceca3a124d7dd6ed2e1; d8a9fd2e6f408316a7ffdf4be4e9daba86afa5dd; 508bd8683dc11ddeada504a72b84867b41741706; ca26658a745c2cd43bb73756931e17a697cad91e; e0f322c561f732366014e88191aa750e7036298d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 989212e6ed9272ab84fe2bd6ebc63049595016e6; 806b873c131f9937840c57d0776730e5822522d4; 0361be133cdc90bb82ff673a8756e6087fdad7cb; 0c701bcd26248f6c50647622684b74d39dbc2921; a4076cbc6f32261728a9fdba3666530486d7f64c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; e43228a194b046824f0ba140047344e101462b15; 962a0b7ae509c4c9ac95ec3e6163b81fe7e07b3d; 54cd75b3a6511161a6eeda62befbd4503f77b28e; fcec8c06bbb97e4777e64bf2536e3b12ca2efe5f; c30f6a2c7c03af450b008ee13af5fc04283868c4; eef6df3f3c1acfd532078da75aec84aef3be8843; 8cf39bd0e7c348eb07650f59e2d7869fc75a6713; 8ff9c70376444bd0e5c861606d461b087d5f2d32; 02cd8c449c341b31d9ed0bfaeb75601df2e3458c; b545effea74c974580e07babca03dd9e6d557d66,,,
e299907bf0d5bf35b5f79037db4b058db2a57613,GPQuest: A Spectral Library Matching Algorithm for Site-Specific Assignment of Tandem Mass Spectra to Intact N-glycopeptides.,"Glycoprotein changes occur in not only protein abundance but also the occupancy of each glycosylation site by different glycoforms during biological or pathological processes. Recent advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation and techniques have facilitated analysis of intact glycopeptides in complex biological samples by allowing the users to generate spectra of intact glycopeptides with glycans attached to each specific glycosylation site. However, assigning these spectra, leading to identification of the glycopeptides, is challenging. Here, we report an algorithm, named GPQuest, for site-specific identification of intact glycopeptides using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation of complex samples. In this algorithm, a spectral library of glycosite-containing peptides in the sample was built by analyzing the isolated glycosite-containing peptides using HCD LC-MS/MS. Spectra of intact glycopeptides were selected by using glycan oxonium ions as signature ions for glycopeptide spectra. These oxonium-ion-containing spectra were then compared with the spectral library generated from glycosite-containing peptides, resulting in assignment of each intact glycopeptide MS/MS spectrum to a specific glycosite-containing peptide. The glycan occupying each glycosite was determined by matching the mass difference between the precursor ion of intact glycopeptide and the glycosite-containing peptide to a glycan database. Using GPQuest, we analyzed LC-MS/MS spectra of protein extracts from prostate tumor LNCaP cells. Without enrichment of glycopeptides from global tryptic peptides and at a false discovery rate of 1%, 1008 glycan-containing MS/MS spectra were assigned to 769 unique intact N-linked glycopeptides, representing 344 N-linked glycosites with 57 different N-glycans. Spectral library matching using GPQuest assigns the HCD LC-MS/MS generated spectra of intact glycopeptides in an automated and high-throughput manner. Additionally, spectral library matching gives the user the possibility of identifying novel or modified glycans on specific glycosites that might be missing from the predetermined glycan databases.",2015,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shadi Toghi Eshghi"", ids = ""5582883""); list(name = ""Punit J Shah"", ids = ""40065788""); list(name = ""Weiming Yang"", ids = ""49230580""); list(name = ""Xingde Li"", ids = ""7137629""); list(name = ""Hui Zhang"", ids = ""32873022"")",c050368e3064df30e2ab4578752db397759e2200; 9d652cbb2da0e2be3b3b2eaf823e2db67d6be240; 141606b3b82d2c3a2b3581c1ee72a0448b311f68; d30142b2878cba0039b83817e0e990bb74b7354c; d2a39a9cf4a46e5305a5ffe50e2e6acf6da16caa; 7809763e2f17f81266e6541a93330c94c7746dc3; 49d6185b2e209031ecdd2a8adef45d13d810efa2; fb623e12375bfe14f0d8e195ace3652d1d4e2359; 6bd650dd23c24e88affbec9ff41729011c30c046; cbeef0feb524f5b46511ae67b8e1e1eac5d48d5f; 127b60cf554eb512b7db0f8d5e096b509405aaa9; 1bc7ce3d1e69b8a62c632918cb4a73d071853316; cb3e317668e21b4b5f0a84f7eb9aff1840f57573; 9839dc8d937598b93fa62ace216e40ac4ec38d81; 9df8f3b5fbd5d840b9dc9ce54f4e4dde6105672f; 3b241d7ec0d7b44e5c022190ac1283a2434b03ec; e418cb8a3881f73501b3d3e84a9e028aa7c4fc52; 72fabf1de75dd46521b79e174f6f7809b9c94944; d1fa711d965c3794436cea5cd55c8ee2d4f343ef; ce4ab9306cc5cdee859309a6cba8cefd48b69d9b; ff52cda620c145e9d1495815fffe57aaa02e58bc; 1fad1641d9024203341be9a484bb65154f2ab9e7; 6430a1cf8b7c72d5eb1aab217198981043457228; 330a03863a0342587d0e7e6af5cf58d1edf66c64; b89b686c89129e1298daffd9c21072cbf346b714; 9d4f7466a579570e05851dd5c35715bfe375c201; 62a227d618bd9bf4af4f44dbc32e8a2d3ab17fee; 7702d6e088a8d38f8d4a1fa2adeeb871df8789c8,,Analytical chemistry,87 10,"

7d70b9288d4b72ab2f269e8a07fcf7e91b9ca706,"Gene expression profiles classifies the responsiveness of human osteosarcoma to doxorubicin, cisplatin and ifosfamide.","9534 Background: Despite the increased survival rates of osteosarcoma patients attributed to adjuvant chemotherapy, at least one third of the patients still succumb to their disease. Furthermore, ultra-aggressive combination chemotherapy is associated with considerable acute and long term toxicity. This is of particular concern in patients who may be cured by a simpler and less toxic regimens or do not have micrometastatic disease. Hence, further improvements in the management of osteosarcoma seemingly depend on diagnostic and prognostic tools that may allow for a more risk adapted and individualized treatment.


METHODS
We have used GE Uniset Human 20K microarrays to obtain gene expression profiles from a panel of ten unique human osteosarcoma xenografts. For each of the three drugs doxorubicin, cisplatin or ifosfamide the xenografts were grouped according to their response to chemotherapy, resistant, weakly sensitive or sensitive. For each individual drug, a one-way ANOVA test with a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple test correction allowing a false discovery rate of 5% (doxorubicin, cisplatin) or 2% (ifosfamide) was used to identify genes with significantly differential expression. In addition a 2-fold cut off was applied to exclude smaller but yet significant differences.


RESULTS
For doxorubicin and cisplatin, respectively 59 and 120 genes met these criteria. The expression levels of 25 genes overlapped between these two groups. For ifosfamide, 148 genes were selected, for 5 of them the expression overlapped with cisplatin sensitivity related genes. In the lists, genes involved in mediating and regulating apoptosis were abundant, such as regulators of TGF signaling, ubiquitin mediated protein degradation and members of the immediate early response protein family. Several genes which products interact with components of the cytoskeleton were also identified.


CONCLUSION
We have used a unique strategy to screen for potential chemosensitivity markers by utilizing xenografts as training sets.

Targeted metabolomics was employed to explore the pathophysiological relevance of hyperinsulinemia in childhood obesity in order to identify biomarkers of IR with potential clinical application.Subjects/Methods:One hundred prepubertal obese children (50 girls/50 boys, 50% IR and 50% non-IR in each group), underwent an oral glucose tolerance test for usual carbohydrate and lipid metabolism determinations. Fasting serum leptin, total and high molecular weight-adiponectin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured and the metabolites showing significant differences between IR and non-IR groups in a previous metabolomics study were quantified. Enrichment of metabolic pathways (quantitative enrichment analysis) and the correlations between lipid and carbohydrate metabolism parameters, adipokines and serum metabolites were investigated, with their discriminatory capacity being evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results:Twenty-three metabolite sets were enriched in the serum metabolome of IR obese children (P<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)<5%). The urea cycle, alanine metabolism and glucose-alanine cycle were the most significantly enriched pathways (PFDR<0.00005). The high correlation between metabolites related to fatty acid oxidation and amino acids (mainly branched chain and aromatic amino acids) pointed to the possible contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in IR. The degree of body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) excess did not correlate with any of the metabolomic components studied. In the ROC analysis, the combination of leptin and alanine showed a high IR discrimination value in the whole cohort (area under curve, AUCALL=0.87), as well as in boys (AUCM=0.84) and girls (AUCF=0.91) when considered separately. However, the specific metabolite/adipokine combinations with highest sensitivity were different between the sexes.Conclusions:Combined sets of metabolic, adipokine and metabolomic parameters can identify pathophysiological relevant IR in a single fasting sample, suggesting a potential application of metabolomic analysis in clinical practice to better identify children at risk without using invasive protocols.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriel Ã\201ngel Martos-Moreno"", ids = ""1398030312""); list(name = ""Annalaura Mastrangelo"", ids = ""4033951""); list(name = ""Violeta MagaÃ±a Barrios"", ids = ""49093357""); list(name = ""Alexis CordovÃ©s GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""49318431""); list(name = ""Julie A Chowen"", ids = ""145842897""); list(name = ""Francisco Javier RupÃ©rez"", ids = ""3498114""); list(name = ""Coral Barbas"", ids = ""2647254""); list(name = ""JesÃºs Argente"", ids = ""2885719"")",d366f5e10bfd7b6911ae252b5b2dceb1373051b4; b58ab9aab9fafc7f9a9218eb09ba0a54ce31362d; dffe0c62ef389309f48003bbe1c6f1d419332463; 34287300ad10e106f58fd3d6a10b3531670a5d9d; 295f3de8b332f34e40843fb507fb09de0e89ce59; 3db95c01b14409cb35fa5d5bacf5b4dd3178e1b8; f5862d4f3f15b20933c7120b25f8335bb833cbd4,da57a85b08e80fe2042db49144cf0631bc02e203; d4cfc7233912375ef15a5f8eaf12430788d711c0; 908997114c24f3ee2cea299ce8be47d17f08799c; 84293638a5c5712cdfcf8427c18107ff9b145ea6; 1c072a5b6a189c18817f5fc6291670cd26921cb2; 79ac1ffb233de30309f61ee4f0b5882690bcca6d; d74d6dea72f94fb9c3f0cf336aa16be331e012e7; 1a17380689e9b4441b3881266529c428b95fccf0; 1c67468e231fdd88d3e495f93cd616dd00097b55; 1b0ba2daafc30863244071b30618075b5f9a4569; 0445a93e8b819aba96bd747a1fd6cfdab1cfc11c; e99e3263d3bc1999be848b216cbcc4f473f67930; 71022474c1f8516be5e38c5c4089c4e4f2136a8b; b4289f4fdfb0f297d3e3e7eadce183805483c9c0; 1647c825e8c611664d16bc727bd6bddfaea3bbb5; 4248ab96098c59741dcd884546afc07f45bc109b; bc7d8f8da1cb170c8626e9a8f778842947ebbad5; 139868478c4557d8bd1b03cd5f76aa85817c8e0d; 9a76a067b3ea5ad4d213ac52aaace2db42ce58ee; 4e54cf73732c73c4a854ef693fe576d9e842e6b7; b980c4a96512c27213073cf09956f87ebdd78b01; cf6d20a8ff7ff24321fb22d6871a6c427f014515; a2ff9decfe438f4553a1e1439b6f752a7eb88ed1; 4d5b2d4babd9b64e3e7fadc3e8a6f19e59571ec2; 802269ab7e59440e6a88a85a005f085901e89c29; 80fe5d7452bb2dd8f613e7cbeedb753d086b9f83; 6c890c0b487ef4aa2073a7b3ff9ff206a465fe2b; 9820618592d2cadf4f9ad7e500b54730ad0cdc10; a8abb439837af454e0ef22ceb58f11a87dac3d6c; 12aed9bf44aaa0693491a30018f956a86716d27e; f551c609ae22720a17f9b8ff09a5342c21b88e64; 5dd46539cfd2d23117ff8ee3bcfad0aab955dc76; 48ddb00f16d574854ad2b3706121ca7f0ea4985f; 32146d3659e824602f3941cbddfc2f789ef0bb19; a54a133562ca25a8955711f9292c2eedbeefb6c6; 93109e48c2c8e6d15f39c65d041c61a8983c500b; b3e24bac1409e453c4cf97b9369847de0d546559; 3e4db62d1bbec4918df3cc96b41b158462c7d512; cbe34983e90259bc589457d13575c541cf891803; 6cc07f1010f830e3b01a148372fbfdbcaac5d97c; 9816067e1308da31e5584238782e06a507061643; 220aff780fc95ad7f57cd148f50a96adc30ba2a3; f8c14c1e65609860831a0e9a47c4b22b5f4a2c2d; d8e890409674052f9cb68d9c261be394b70603fe; 43ec1056c93e813ce093577ab31f4e64be9e7279; 04165326ecb4a5281e473fd1a047fa9cffb809e3; 569bd50cf553700af34fa9135ffa6976f14a10ce; 4e936f97127355ae6e197e9c3946289d27ee21cd; 26d464ce7c9087a52264e2d0db0ebcf4013cae40; d7e23fc594abe0e6d294e5857c0c66ec5a7c8bca; 507488cb8b4e6989ffe1b0f7297cc403effc0c51; 865b391c1cea2f1a6d74db5017820c38d0d706f7; f10864faa4a1b083605bd2f10d9600a0fed9a5d5; 020e471628d244c3d1f7bd890e9071caedec9353; eec09a61d7e9e978b33c18c17399cb7f93316945; 0a217118d276ec54aaf29aa0a07647cdc30064f4; c2f26961e009f513a30ddc976dcd3f2d8c72dbbf; 2301b048ad1858c3d178f28f7eef097651061767; 27e54799aff7a7d3c5e0cbe587a89f2d44f26b6e; 0d2588b73634bd432f4b3fd7c68f1c8db8b339a3,International Journal of Obesity,41,1473-1480
26a2ef772efed94ce27e69a1f1b2493dcbd93f74,Multiple comparisons: philosophies and illustrations.,"Statistical procedures underpin the process of scientific discovery. As researchers, one way we use these procedures is to test the validity of a null hypothesis. Often, we test the validity of more than one null hypothesis. If we fail to use an appropriate procedure to account for this multiplicity, then we are more likely to reach a wrong scientific conclusion-we are more likely to make a mistake. In physiology, experiments that involve multiple comparisons are common: of the original articles published in 1997 by the American Physiological Society, approximately 40% cite a multiple comparison procedure. In this review, I demonstrate the statistical issue embedded in multiple comparisons, and I summarize the philosophies of handling this issue. I also illustrate the three procedures-Newman-Keuls, Bonferroni, least significant difference-cited most often in my literature review; each of these procedures is of limited practical value. Last, I demonstrate the false discovery rate procedure, a promising development in multiple comparisons. The false discovery rate procedure may be the best practical solution to the problems of multiple comparisons that exist within physiology and other scientific disciplines.",2000,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Douglas Curranâ\200\220Everett"", ids = ""1382463183"")",b8845597135e69a3675842f2386130f901b921bd;

75ae270e48294553ae34a637602c98ea750357c0,"Placental DNA methylation at term reflects maternal serum levels of INHA and FN1, but not PAPPA, early in pregnancy","BackgroundEarly detection of pregnancies at risk of complications, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE), is critical for improved monitoring and preventative treatment to optimize health outcomes. We predict that levels of placental-derived proteins circulating in maternal blood reflect placental gene expression, which is associated with placental DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. As such, placental DNAm profiling may be useful to distinguish pregnancies at risk of developing complications and correlation between DNAm and protein levels in maternal blood may give further evidence for a proteinâ€™s use as a biomarker. However, few studies investigate all clinical parameters that may influence DNAm and/or protein expression, which can significantly affect the relationship between these measures.Results Candidate genes were chosen based on i) reported alterations of protein levels in maternal blood and ii) observed changes in placental DNAm (âˆ†Î²â€‰>â€‰0.05 and False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05) in pregnancies complicated by PE/IUGR. Fibronectin (FN1) enhancer DNAm and placental gene expression were inversely correlated (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.88 pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). The same trend was observed between promoter DNAm and gene expression for INHBA and PAPPA, though not significant. INHBA and FN1 DNAm was associated with gestationalâ€“age corrected birth weight, while INHA levels were associated with fetal: placental weight ratio and FN1 level was associated with maternal body mass index (BMI).DNAm at the INHBA promoter in the term placenta was negatively correlated with second trimester maternal serum levels (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.50 pâ€‰=â€‰0.01) and DNAm at the FN1 enhancer was negatively associated with third trimester maternal serum levels (râ€‰=â€‰âˆ’0.38, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009). However, a similar correlation was not found for PAPPA.ConclusionsThese results show that establishing a correlation between altered DNAm in the term placenta and altered maternal serum levels of the corresponding protein, is affected by a number of factors. Nonetheless, the correlation between placental DNAm of INHBA/FN1 and maternal serum INHA/FN1 levels indicate that DNAm may be a useful tool to identify novel biomarkers for adverse pregnancy outcomes in some cases.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Samantha Louise Wilson"", ids = ""40163065""); list(name = ""John D.

17f27ff464b88f585dc6c8f80d04ec03d6642ce1,Decreased fecundity and sperm DNA methylation patterns.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the relationship between epigenetic patterns in sperm and fecundity.


DESIGN
Prospective study.


SETTING
Academic andrology and in vitro fertilization laboratory.


PATIENT(S)
Twenty-seven semen samples from couples who conceived within 2 months of attempting a pregnancy and 29 semen samples from couples unable to achieve a pregnancy within 12 months.


INTERVENTION(S)
None.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Genomewide assessment of differential sperm DNA methylation and standard semen analysis.


RESULT(S)
We analyzed DNA methylation alterations associated with fecundity in 124 semen samples, and identified regions of interest in 27 semen samples from couples who conceived within 2 months of attempting a pregnancy and a total of 29 semen samples from couples who were unable to achieve a pregnancy within 12 months. No differences in sperm count, sperm morphology, or semen volume were observed between the patients achieving a pregnancy within 2 months of study time and those not obtaining a pregnancy within 12 months. However, using data from the human methylation 450k array analysis we did identify two genomic regions with statistically significantly decreased (false discovery rate <0.01) methylation and three genomic regions with statistically significantly increased methylation in the failure-to-conceive group. The only two sites where decreased methylation was associated with reduced fecundity are at closely related genes known to be expressed in sperm, HSPA1L and HSPA1B.


CONCLUSION(S)
Our data suggest that there are genomic loci where DNA methylation alterations are associated with decreased fecundity. We have thus identified candidate loci for future study to verify these results and investigate the causative or contributory relationship between altered sperm methylation and decreased fecundity.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy G Jenkins"", ids = ""35956835""); list(name = ""Kenneth I.

eb150bc9af67ea09b45839e3e64c04f2ea02eb54,Genome-Wide Analysis of Antiviral Signature Genes in Porcine Macrophages at Different Activation Statuses,"Macrophages (MÐ¤s) can be polarized to various activation statuses, including classical (M1), alternative (M2), and antiviral states. To study the antiviral activation status of porcine MÐ¤s during porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, we used RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) for transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation showed that our RNA-Seq data met the criteria for genome-wide transcriptomic analysis. Comparisons of any two activation statuses revealed more than 20,000 DEGs that were normalized to filter out 153-5,303 significant DEGs [false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤0.001, fold change â‰¥2] in each comparison. The highest 5,303 significant DEGs were found between lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) and interferon (IFN)Î³-stimulated M1 cells, whereas only 153 significant DEGs were detected between interleukin (IL)-10-polarized M2 cells and control mock-activated cells. To identify signature genes for antiviral regulation pertaining to each activation status, we identified a set of DEGs that showed significant up-regulation in only one activation state. In addition, pathway analyses defined the top 20-50 significantly regulated pathways at each activation status, and we further analyzed DEGs pertinent to pathways mediated by AMP kinase (AMPK) and epigenetic mechanisms. For the first time in porcine macrophages, our transcriptomic analyses not only compared family-wide differential expression of most known immune genes at different activation statuses, but also revealed transcription evidence of multiple gene families. These findings show that using RNA-Seq transcriptomic analyses in virus-infected and status-synchronized macrophages effectively profiled signature genes and gene response pathways for antiviral regulation, which may provide a framework for optimizing antiviral immunity and immune homeostasis.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yongming Sang"", ids = ""5947658""); list(name = ""Wyatt Brichalli"", ids = ""4464176""); list(name = ""Raymond R.

e59c774aec4c867504721ba1a81908b7e2e9ad0b,QPROT: Statistical method for testing differential expression using protein-level intensity data in label-free quantitative proteomics.,"UNLABELLED
We introduce QPROT, a statistical framework and computational tool for differential protein expression analysis using protein intensity data. QPROT is an extension of the QSPEC suite, originally developed for spectral count data, adapted for the analysis using continuously measured protein-level intensity data. QPROT offers a new intensity normalization procedure and model-based differential expression analysis, both of which account for missing data. Determination of differential expression of each protein is based on the standardized Z-statistic based on the posterior distribution of the log fold change parameter, guided by the false discovery rate estimated by a well-known Empirical Bayes method. We evaluated the classification performance of QPROT using the quantification calibration data from the clinical proteomic technology assessment for cancer (CPTAC) study and a recently published Escherichia coli benchmark dataset, with evaluation of FDR accuracy in the latter.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
QPROT is a statistical framework with computational software tool for comparative quantitative proteomics analysis. It features various extensions of QSPEC method originally built for spectral count data analysis, including probabilistic treatment of missing values in protein intensity data. With the increasing popularity of label-free quantitative proteomics data, the proposed method and accompanying software suite will be immediately useful for many proteomics laboratories.

a2e9d3e37b34a4e4ce2d27e09b69cd33b904b071,xpression profiling of human idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,"Objective: To investigate the global changes accompanying human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) we performed a large-scale expression screen using myocardial biopsies from a group of DCM patients with moderate heart failure. By hierarchical clustering and functional annotation of the deregulated genes we examined extensive changes in the cellular and molecular processes associated to DCM. Methods: The expression profiles were obtained using a whole genome covering library (UniGene RZPD1) comprising 30 336 cDNA clones and amplified RNA from myocardiac biopsies from 10 DCM patients in comparison to tissue samples from four non-failing, healthy donors.Results: By setting stringent selection criteria 364 differentially expressed, sequence-verified non-redundant transcripts were identified with a false discovery rate of ,0.001. Numerous genes and ESTs were identified representing previously recognised, as well as novel DCM-associated transcripts. Many of them were found to be upregulated and involved in cardiomyocyte energetics, muscle contraction or signalling. Two hundred and twenty-two deregulated transcripts were functionally annotated and hierarchically clustered providing an insight into the pathophysiology of DCM. Data was validated using the MLP-deficient mouse, in which several differentially expressed transcripts identified in the human DCM biopsies could be confirmed. Conclusions: We report the first genome-wide expression profile analysis using cardiac biopsies from DCM patients at various stages of the disease. Although there is a diversity of links between the cytoskeleton and the initiation of DCM, we speculate that genes implicated in intracellular signalling and in muscle contraction are associated with early stages of the disease.

We aimed to systematically review and explore the frequency and type of malformations/chromosomal syndromes and to identify significant biological/genetic roles in gastroschisis.MethodsPopulation-based, gastroschisis-associated anomalies/chromosomal defects published 1950â€“2018 (PubMed/MEDLINE) were independently searched by two reviewers. Associated anomalies/chromosomal defects and selected clinical characteristics were subdivided and pooled by race, system/region, isolated, and associated cases (descriptive analysis and chi-square test were performed). Critical regions/genes from representative chromosomal syndromes including an enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology Consortium/Panther Classification System databases were explored. Fisherâ€™s exact test with False Discovery Rate multiple test correction was performed.ResultsSixty-eight articles and 18525 cases as a base were identified (prevalence of 17.9 and 3% for associated anomalies/chromosomal defects, respectively). There were 3596 associated anomalies, prevailing those cardiovascular (23.3%) and digestive (20.3%). Co-occurring anomalies were associated with male, female, American Indian, Caucasian, prenatally diagnosed, chromosomal defects, and mortality (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001). Gene clusters on 21q22.11 and 21q22.3 (KRTAP), 18q21.33 (SERPINB), 18q22.1 (CDH7, CDH19), 13q12.3 (FLT1), 13q22.1 (KLF5), 13q22.3 (EDNRB), and 13q34 (COL4A1, COL4A2, F7, F10) were significantly related to biological processes: blood pressure regulation and/or vessel integrity, angiogenesis, coagulation, cellâ€“cell and/or cell-matrix adhesion, dermis integrity, and wound healing (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that gastroschisis may result from the interaction of several chromosomal regions in an additive manner as a pool of candidate genes were identified from critical regions supporting a role for vascular disruption, thrombosis, and mesodermal deficiency in the pathogenesis of gastroschisis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""VÃ­ctor M Salinas-Torres"", ids = ""1401533757""); list(name = ""Rafael A.

These QTL were identified in separate analyses of two sets of data using stringent genome-wide significant thresholds. The current study reports the reanalysis of the combined F2 data using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to control the multiple hypothesistesting problem, in order to identify potential QTL of smaller effect.

8523b76efbbee2df908ed3933456a6a7f936f61c,Effect of simulated air dive and decompression sickness on the plasma proteome of rats.,"PURPOSE
Decompression sickness (DCS) is a poorly understood systemic disease caused by inadequate desaturation following a reduction in ambient pressure. Although recent studies highlight the importance of circulating factors, the available data are still puzzling. In this study, we aimed to identify proteins and biological pathways involved in the development of DCS in rats.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a same simulated air dive to 1000Â kPa absolute pressure and divided into two groups: no DCS or DCS. A third control group remained at atmospheric pressure. Venous blood was collected after hyperbaric exposure and the plasma proteomes from four individuals per group were analyzed by using a two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomic strategy.


RESULTS
Quantitative analysis identified nine protein spots with abundances significantly changed (false discovery rate < 0.1) between the tested conditions. Three protein spots, identified as Apolipoprotein A1, Serine Protease Inhibitor A3K (Serpin A3K), and Alpha-1-antiproteinase, appeared increased in DCS animals but displayed only weak changes. By contrast, one protein spot identified as Transthyretin (TTR) dramatically decreased (i.e. quite disappeared) in animals displaying DCS symptoms.

126b149100ee95c38ee723e28cb70d8e98a6d689,A Genome Wide Association Study of Plasmodium falciparum Susceptibility to 22 Antimalarial Drugs in Kenya,"BACKGROUND
Drug resistance remains a chief concern for malaria control. In order to determine the genetic markers of drug resistant parasites, we tested the genome-wide associations (GWA) of sequence-based genotypes from 35 Kenyan P. falciparum parasites with the activities of 22 antimalarial drugs.


METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Parasites isolated from children with acute febrile malaria were adapted to culture, and sensitivity was determined by in vitro growth in the presence of anti-malarial drugs. Parasites were genotyped using whole genome sequencing techniques. Associations between 6250 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and resistance to individual anti-malarial agents were determined, with false discovery rate adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. We identified expected associations in the pfcrt region with chloroquine (CQ) activity, and other novel loci associated with amodiaquine, quinazoline, and quinine activities. Signals for CQ and primaquine (PQ) overlap in and around pfcrt, and interestingly the phenotypes are inversely related for these two drugs. We catalog the variation in dhfr, dhps, mdr1, nhe, and crt, including novel SNPs, and confirm the presence of a dhfr-164L quadruple mutant in coastal Kenya. Mutations implicated in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance are at or near fixation in this sample set.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
Sequence-based GWA studies are powerful tools for phenotypic association tests. Using this approach on falciparum parasites from coastal Kenya we identified known and previously unreported genes associated with phenotypic resistance to anti-malarial drugs, and observe in high-resolution haplotype visualizations a possible signature of an inverse selective relationship between CQ and PQ.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jason P Wendler"", ids = ""49582254""); list(name = ""John Okombo"", ids = ""6917386""); list(name = ""Roberto Amato"", ids = ""46534251""); list(name = ""Olivo Miotto"", ids = ""2167202""); list(name = ""Steven M.

49efc12b16bdb5cf59fed3424bd180946dcb55df,Serum Metabolomics of Slow vs. Rapid Motor Progression Parkinsonâ€™s Disease: a Pilot Study,"Progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly variable, indicating that differences between slow and rapid progression forms could provide valuable information for improved early detection and management. Unfortunately, this represents a complex problem due to the heterogeneous nature of humans in regards to demographic characteristics, genetics, diet, environmental exposures and health behaviors. In this pilot study, we employed high resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling to investigate the metabolic signatures of slow versus rapidly progressing PD present in human serum. Archival serum samples from PD patients obtained within 3 years of disease onset were analyzed via dual chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, with data extraction by xMSanalyzer and used to predict rapid or slow motor progression of these patients during follow-up. Statistical analyses, such as false discovery rate analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis, yielded a list of statistically significant metabolic features and further investigation revealed potential biomarkers. In particular, N8-acetyl spermidine was found to be significantly elevated in the rapid progressors compared to both control subjects and slow progressors. Our exploratory data indicate that a fast motor progression disease phenotype can be distinguished early in disease using high resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling and that altered polyamine metabolism may be a predictive marker of rapidly progressing PD.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""James R.

1d11b24f74c731b226164f1ad996daf80ef27327,Association of genetic variants with myocardial infarction in Japanese individuals with metabolic syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to myocardial infarction (MI) in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS).


METHODS
The study population comprised 1887 Japanese individuals with MetS, including 773 subjects with MI and 1114 controls. The genotypes for 136 polymorphisms of 97 candidate genes were determined.


RESULTS
An initial screen by the chi-square test revealed that seven polymorphisms were significantly (false discovery rate<0.05) associated with the prevalence of MI in individuals with MetS. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that the G-->A (Ser89Asn) polymorphism of UTS2 [odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-3.08], the 2445G-->A (Ala54Thr) polymorphism of FABP2 (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.23-2.40), the -11377C-->G polymorphism of ADIPOQ (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.79), the -231A-->G polymorphism of EDNRA (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.89), and the -108/3G-->4G polymorphism of PDX1 (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with MI. The variant alleles of UTS2, FABP2, and ADIPOQ were risk factors for MI, whereas the variant alleles of EDNRA and PDX1 were protective against this condition. A stepwise forward selection procedure demonstrated that UTS2, FABP2, ADIPOQ, EDNRA, and PDX1 genotypes were significant (P<0.05) and independent determinants of MI.


CONCLUSIONS
Determination of genotypes for these polymorphisms of UTS2, FABP2, ADIPOQ, EDNRA, and PDX1 may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for MI in Japanese individuals with MetS.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Tadao Itoh"", ids = ""47763242""); list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""153124940""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yutaka Nishigaki"", ids = ""6466382""); list(name = ""Masashi Tanaka"", ids = ""2065043""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""7197365""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",432dcf01850291943284045658cd7d17ec3bcc42; 5bd3f30c4b9020b115eac642c7d7fd10632ce33a; f3e535fd4ce18f24d0dcbf72702eb6d7009b4584; 1203e11cf342f43b8f843f2173a1148eaad45f41; 806f89b80160c95e6ae143b5ba72f1f271eaccfe; f8c1dc75d1254fb4ac7b13086d143cfb0266966b; 120b33f95610ff61be30d6730697ec90693a4f86; 4e1b637fbd8811ac4174e5ba389eddaacc34a9a9; 2a7343ff930dbc6fb8cf82aba0662914dcf02253; cca92cc750477c57ced05097dba229d80a67be01; e18291bd7d21b38e4cc1b0dd04ebaa473811d804; 970a9ab199d36f3fd5628b884516fc23164659c6; 32f072f649fe4e3851b16083fdd2f20a02398d74; 27f42e528eeca27b0190317cc67a1d66eb86e4b0; a267092e3a638ac25cda6751f1522704e98e1502; 0c68fda1387a6606cbbdaf8aa11ee540ba488cb3; 62be62bf0f158345f75e6c566442a831dd92951c; 15553cd855e9cab5173d53dba909f9d3ffc221c3; 459a65157592599544e150a74c2b68af2fc1e117; 70adbfb5098bdfb5a50155e1a4bca9f1cdf3bfd3; a34ad295e59a41a6724ded1bd0832458f8729968; 9f38873c8a99651e79c138f53280faf6d27c23bc,f5dd35803733bc99c44300302d6860c68dad9119; 8bb7ac429b743f21c7539b3df104d6abc85ed91b; c7e0e9d78a1f52569fa98af7fbf66e8f11612768; 032ba8bfc8d2c54d553bd639018b0695f743fba3; 0e01084882ab2522bea6d7b352e82d3a440c987f; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; 26e39127085e74aa6ff62665e8b6e48185d61414; f52e64a3f0dd336a48b925337c541f86252849f1; ed9ab44a87548ae2cd30b0f9a5f752454cfd8421; 3fb0ab763bfe1a3ccc947cd0d9be9966d37f7353; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0b481d03f44e45064b51cad9df476e868319fbf4; c7a687d0032f5954379eec76c00ad69fe47d45a8; 750f97f8d6a81f0da0b6ddf9dfba8561ccee639a; 7cb43bbf98f1ff9cee60c526442d1459059f8036; 1d470455a468022e188cd22c952823d64f0acc89; 00e403c692837ac226164871e3214adf5ec658dc; 2c15ddf02cf2d296513956ee31f88787e39e9ced; c58b592b03b853844bc7f901a19e27e5ac3c829c; de3f2f2b6084814082e8d11589ac8b39ad537e93; 977fc88be694327e26d79470b4854d94c4998c24; cb56e140c9881fbdd9fc0a6c54e92f66e7f5f025; ea768661fd6731ab2de740b57e582912e76638e7; 87f387e1fc3c89d53907b15d988024712fa67ed5; f5f4728fc62d0d109cc2fbeb26c6702d125017f6; a0bdf1d25b446e75cf91cd29f1d05ece252b7b64; 11045abe908772f5bfe0d7367ddd9f3b66c8006c; f9d430d321f57580e9645ddb0585a2921e1081ac; 1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558,Atherosclerosis,206 2,"

To make a reliable protein catalog of the Korean plasma proteome, various experimental methods, such as 1-D HPLC, 2-D LC, and narrow ranged 2-DE prior to MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS, were used to identify unique plasma proteins in this population. To compile candidates with high confidence, two different search engines were used to select proteins with a false discovery rate of less than or equal to 1%. From this rigorous selection process, we initially identified 494 distinct Korean plasma proteins. After multilevel stepwise filtrations with stringent, identification parameters were applied to acquire plasma protein list with the maximum confidence; a total 185 distinct plasma proteins were identified and integrated into our Korean human plasma proteome project database along with several bioinformatics analysis results, including gene ontology, biological pathways, tissue expression, and disease association.

f31743a37671d0cab926ccaf28ffc579582cbdae,False Variable Selection Rates in Regression,"There has been recent interest in extending the ideas of False Discovery Rates (FDR) to variable selection in regression settings. Traditionally the FDR in these settings has been defined in terms of the coefficients of the full regression model. Recent papers have struggled with controlling this quantity when the predictors are correlated. This paper shows that this full model definition of FDR suffers from unintuitive and potentially undesirable behavior in the presence of correlated predictors. We propose a new false selection error criterion, the False Variable Rate (FVR), that avoids these problems and behaves in a more intuitive manner. We discuss the behavior of this criterion and how it compares with the traditional FDR, as well as presenting guidelines for determining which is appropriate in a particular setting. Finally, we present a simple estimation procedure for FVR in stepwise variable selection. We analyze the performance of this estimator and draw connections to recent estimators in the literature.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Max Jacob Grazier G'Sell"", ids = ""1405080955""); list(name = ""Trevor J.

632d948109728efbc57e45c6036c458644de26d3,Associating quantitative behavioral traits with gene expression in the brain: searching for diamonds in the hay,"UNLABELLED
Gene expression and phenotypic functionality can best be associated when they are measured quantitatively within the same experiment. The analysis of such a complex experiment is presented, searching for associations between measures of exploratory behavior in mice and gene expression in brain regions. The analysis of such experiments raises several methodological problems. First and foremost, the size of the pool of potential discoveries being screened is enormous yet only few biologically relevant findings are expected, making the problem of multiple testing especially severe. We present solutions based on screening by testing related hypotheses, then testing the hypotheses of interest. In one variant the subset is selected directly, in the other one a tree of hypotheses is tested hierarchical; both variants control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Other problems in such experiments are in the fact that the level of data aggregation may be different for the quantitative traits (one per animal) and gene expression measurements (pooled across animals); in that the association may not be linear; and in the resolution of interest only few replications exist. We offer solutions to these problems as well. The hierarchical FDR testing strategies presented here can serve beyond the structure of our motivating example study to any complex microarray study.

e0945e36c38f6567ffc484bb59ef107464c974ae,Comprehensive analysis of schizophrenia-associated loci highlights ion channel pathways and biologically plausible candidate causal genes.,"Over 100 associated genetic loci have been robustly associated with schizophrenia. Gene prioritization and pathway analysis have focused on a priori hypotheses and thus may have been unduly influenced by prior assumptions and missed important causal genes and pathways. Using a data-driven approach, we show that genes in associated loci: (1) are highly expressed in cortical brain areas; (2) are enriched for ion channel pathways (false discovery rates <0.05); and (3) contain 62 genes that are functionally related to each other and hence represent promising candidates for experimental follow up. We validate the relevance of the prioritized genes by showing that they are enriched for rare disruptive variants and de novo variants from schizophrenia sequencing studies (odds ratio 1.67, P = 0.039), and are enriched for genes encoding members of mouse and human postsynaptic density proteomes (odds ratio 4.56, P = 5.00 Ã— 10(-4); odds ratio 2.60, P = 0.049).The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first 2 authors should be regarded as joint First Author.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tune H.

6be8046d6c2f0f259bdbf1222826c13f31174dfe,Differential item functioning analysis by applying multiple comparison procedures.,"Analysis within a Rasch measurement framework aims at development of valid and objective test score. One requirement of both validity and objectivity is that items do not show evidence of differential item functioning (DIF). A number of procedures exist for the assessment of DIF including those based on analysis of contingency tables by Mantel-Haenszel tests and partial gamma coefficients. The aim of this paper is to illustrate Multiple Comparison Procedures (MCP) for analysis of DIF relative to a variable defining a very large number of groups, with an unclear ordering with respect to the DIF effect. We propose a single step procedure controlling the false discovery rate for DIF detection. The procedure applies for both dichotomous and polytomous items. In addition to providing evidence against a hypothesis of no DIF, the procedure also provides information on subset of groups that are homogeneous with respect to the DIF effect. A stepwise MCP procedure for this purpose is also introduced.",2015,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Paolo Eusebi"", ids = ""3189604""); list(name = ""Svend Kreiner"", ids = ""3603472"")",,,Journal of applied measurement,16 1,"

162dd5de49ca219c3e8051aa91aecd2323440bfb,Independent component and pathway-based analysis of miRNA-regulated gene expression in a model of type 1 diabetes,"BackgroundSeveral approaches have been developed for miRNA target prediction, including methods that incorporate expression profiling. However the methods are still in need of improvements due to a high false discovery rate. So far, none of the methods have used independent component analysis (ICA). Here, we developed a novel target prediction method based on ICA that incorporates both seed matching and expression profiling of miRNA and mRNA expressions. The method was applied on a cellular model of type 1 diabetes.ResultsMicrorray profiling identified eight miRNAs (miR-124/128/192/194/204/375/672/708) with differential expression. Applying ICA on the mRNA profiling data revealed five significant independent components (ICs) correlating to the experimental conditions. The five ICs also captured the miRNA expressions by explaining >97% of their variance. By using ICA, seven of the eight miRNAs showed significant enrichment of sequence predicted targets, compared to only four miRNAs when using simple negative correlation. The ICs were enriched for miRNA targets that function in diabetes-relevant pathways e.g. type 1 and type 2 diabetes and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).ConclusionsIn this study, ICA was applied as an attempt to separate the various factors that influence the mRNA expression in order to identify miRNA targets. The results suggest that ICA is better at identifying miRNA targets than negative correlation.

bc8bdafb81b5a47e0149c1197faacbffd24eacc5,Clinical and Molecular Characterization of Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia,"Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a rare form of multiple myeloma (MM) that is characterized by aggressive behavior and short overall survival (OS) despite significant improvement in anti-MM therapy. Due to its low incidence of 1-2% of all MM patients, most previous studies reported only on a small number of pPCL patients and the physiopathology as well as best treatment approaches remain unclear. In order to improve outcome in this patient population it will be necessary to evaluate molecular mechanisms underlying pPCL, which could potentially serve as therapeutic targets. The goal of the present study was to address clinical parameters and survival in pPCL patients. We further analyzed molecular characteristics by gene expression analysis and exome sequencing with the aim to detect distinct markers in pPCL. We retrospectively evaluated 84 pPCL patients who were treated at the Myeloma Institute in Little Rock, and had at least cytogenetic (by karyotype) and outcome data available. The cytogenetic analysis showed a complex karyotype (>3 chromosomal aberrations) in 88% of the patients and hypodiploidy in 54% patients. Deletion 13 was very common and seen in 54% of patients and translocation 11;14 and deletion 17p were evident in 22% and 19% of patients respectively. These results are consistent with previous reports and show a higher prevalence of poor prognosis alterations in pPCL patients compared to non-pPCL MM patients. Clinical and biological characteristics of pPCL patients showed very high proportion of ISS 3 stage (86%) and bone marrow (BM) plasma cell infiltration of at least 70% in 77% of patients. Median overall survival (OS) of this pPCL population was 17 months. When restricting the analysis to patients We further evaluated gene expression profiling (GEP) from BM aspirates, which was performed on 54 patients and used the previously described 70-gene classifier (GEP70) for risk assessment. Surprisingly 40% of the patients had a low risk (LR) GEP70 profile, suggesting that pPCL might be more heterogeneous than previously thought or that some pPCL - with less aggressive biology - is caused from overcrowding of extensively involved BM space with leakage into the peripheral blood. Though median OS in LR pPCL patients was significantly higher than in HR patients (30 vs 16months, p=0.025), it still remained short suggesting that other parameters not identified by GEP70 influence outcome. In order to identify a gene signature specific to pPCL, we next studied differential gene expression of 18670 probes in BM samples from pPCL patients and compared them with healthy controls. There were 130 differentially expressed probes with at least 5 fold change at a false discovery rate of We further analyzed data on targeted exome sequencing which was performed on 10 pPCL patients. A mutation in the RAS oncogene was present in 9 patients (KRAS n=5, NRAS n=3, one patient had both mutation), which is a much higher prevalence of RAS mutations than the previously described ~40% in non pPCL MM. TP53 mutations were second most common and seen in 5 patients. In summary, this is the largest series of patients with pPCL reported so far. It confirms the poor prognosis of pPCL, even in young patients that were treated with an aggressive approach and in GEP70 defined LR disease. PHF19, a regulator of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that leads to transcriptional repression through H3K27 hypermethylation, was highly expressed in pCPL patients and its role in disease pathogenesis should be further evaluated. Further, targeted exome sequencing showed a RAS mutations in 90% of patients and though the patient number for this analysis was small, already available therapy targeting the RAS-pathway should be evaluated in pPCL patients.

ef8353c6fed8ac6222f5941718cea794a32ed12a,A proteomic clock for malignant gliomas: The role of the environment in tumorigenesis at the presymptomatic stage,"Malignant gliomas remain incurable with a poor prognosis despite of aggressive treatment. We have been studying the development of brain tumors in a glioma rat model, where rats develop brain tumors after prenatal exposure to ethylnitrosourea (ENU), and there is a sizable interval between when the first pathological changes are noted and tumors become detectable with MRI. Our aim to define a molecular timeline through proteomic profiling of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) such that brain tumor commitment can be revealed earlier than at the presymptomatic stage. A comparative proteomic approach was applied to profile CSF collected serially either before, at and after the time MRI becomes positive. Elastic net (EN) based models were developed to infer the timeline of normal or tumor development respectively, mirroring a chronology of precisely timed, ""clocked"", adaptations. These CSF changes were later quantified by longitudinal entropy analyses of the EN predictive metric. False discovery rates (FDR) were computed to control the expected proportion of the EN models that are due to multiple hypothesis testing. Our ENU rat brain tumor dating EN model indicated that protein content in CSF is programmed even before tumor MRI detection. The findings of the precisely timed CSF tumor microenvironment changes at presymptomatic stages, deviation from the normal development timeline, may provide the groundwork for the understanding of adaptation of the brain environment in tumorigenesis to devise effective brain tumor management strategies.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Le Zheng"", ids = ""144183274""); list(name = ""Yeping Zhang"", ids = ""48378747""); list(name = ""Shiying Hao"", ids = ""40543741""); list(name = ""Lin Chen"", ids = ""49329837""); list(name = ""Z.

f32325c647b6ebb3e2b2cb3e36c6a37024a39817,Experimental intrauterine growth restriction induces alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression in pancreatic islets of rats.,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) increases susceptibility to age-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and is associated with permanent and progressive changes in gene expression. Our study was designed to test whether epigenomic dysregulation mediates the cellular memory of this intrauterine event. To test this hypothesis, we isolated pancreatic islets from control and IUGR (induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation at day 18 of fetal life) animals at 7 weeks of age. Using the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR) assay, we generated the first DNA methylation map at almost 1 million unique sites throughout the rat genome in normal pancreatic islet cells, allowing us to identify the changes that occur as a consequence of IUGR. We validated candidate dysregulated loci with quantitative assays of cytosine methylation and gene expression. IUGR changes cytosine methylation at approximately 1,400 loci (false discovery rate of 4.2%) in male rats at 7 weeks of age, preceding the development of diabetes and thus representing candidate loci for mediating the pathogenesis of metabolic disease that occurs later in life. Epigenetic dysregulation occurred preferentially at conserved intergenic sequences, frequently near genes regulating processes known to be abnormal in IUGR islets, such as vascularization, beta-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and cell death, associated with concordant changes in mRNA expression. These results demonstrate that epigenetic dysregulation is a strong candidate for propagating the cellular memory of intrauterine events, causing changes in expression of nearby genes and long term susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Reid F.

Materials and Methods All participants gave written informed consent to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. One hundred eight patients with symptomatic CAD but no dementia were included, and a score less than 82 represented cognitive impairment. Group comparison and interrelations between global cognitive and fluency performance, lesion topography, and ultrastructural damage were assessed with voxel-based statistics. Associations between cognition, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), lesion volumes, and global white matter ultrastructural damage indexed as increased mean diffusivity were tested with regression analysis by controlling for age. Diagnostic accuracy of imaging markers selected from a multivariate prediction model was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Cognitively impaired patients (n = 53 [49.1%], classified as having probable vascular cognitive disorder) were older than nonimpaired patients (P = .027) and had more frequent MTA (P < .001), more cortical infarctions (P = .016), and larger volumes of acute (P = .028) and chronic (P = .009) subcortical ischemic lesions. Lesion volumes did not correlate with global cognitive performance (lacunar infarctions, P = .060; acute lesions, P = .088; chronic subcortical ischemic lesions, P = .085). In contrast, cognitive performance correlated with presence of chronic ischemic lesions within the interhemispheric tracts and thalamic radiation (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Skeleton mean diffusivity showed the closest correlation with cognition (R2 = 0.311, P < .001) and promising diagnostic accuracy for vascular cognitive disorder (area under the curve, 0.82 [95% confidence interval: 0.75, 0.90]). Findings were confirmed in subjects with a low risk of preclinical Alzheimer disease indexed by the absence of MTA (n = 85). Conclusion Subcortical white matter ischemic lesion locations and severity of ultrastructural tract damage contribute to cognitive impairment in symptomatic CAD, which suggests that subcortical disconnection within large-scale cognitive neural networks is a key mechanism of vascular cognitive disorder.

b34e8bef6360bdd2d194174036848404e2eb097c,Meta-analysis of Blood Genome-Wide Expression Profiling Studies in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.,"Inflammatory cell infiltrates are a prominent feature of aberrant vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), suggesting that immune effector cells contribute to disease progression. Genome-wide blood expression profiling studies have attempted to better define this inflammatory component of PAH pathobiology, but have been hampered by small sample sizes, methodological differences and very little gene-level reproducibility. The current meta-analysis (seven studies; 156 PAH patients/110 healthy controls) was performed to assess the comparability of data across studies and to possibly derive a generalizable transcriptomic signature. Idiopathic (IPAH) compared to disease-associated PAH (APAH) displayed highly similar expression profiles with no differentially expressed genes, even after substantially relaxing selection stringency. In contrast, using a false discovery rate of â‰¤1% and I2<40% (low to moderate heterogeneity across studies) both IPAH and APAH differed markedly from healthy controls with the combined PAH cohort yielding 1,269 differentially expressed, unique gene transcripts. Bioinformatic analyses, including gene-set enrichment which uses all available data independent of gene selection thresholds, identified interferon, mTOR/p70S6K, stress kinase and toll-like receptor signaling as enriched mechanisms within the PAH gene signature. Enriched biological functions and diseases included tumorigenesis, autoimmunity, antiviral response and cell death consistent with prevailing theories of PAH pathogenesis. Although otherwise indistinguishable, APAH (predominantly PAH due to systemic sclerosis) had a somewhat stronger interferon profile than IPAH. Meta-analysis defined a robust and generalizable transcriptomic signature in the blood of PAH patients that can help inform the identification of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jason M.

6ac15670bedfc2469cfbe152a6be8b7f23cd4b1d,Minimally invasive skin tape strip RNA sequencing identifies novel characteristics of the type 2â€“high atopic dermatitis disease endotype,"Background: Expression profiling of skin biopsy specimens has established molecular features of the skin in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). The invasiveness of biopsies has prevented their use in defining individualâ€level AD pathobiological mechanisms (endotypes) in large research studies. Objective: We sought to determine whether minimally invasive skin tape strip transcriptome analysis identifies gene expression dysregulation in AD and molecular disease endotypes. Methods: We sampled nonlesional and lesional skin tape strips and biopsy specimens from white adult patients with AD (18 male and 12 female patients; age [mean Â± SE], 36.3 Â± 2.2 years) and healthy control subjects (9 male and 16 female subjects; age [mean Â± SE], 34.8 Â± 2.2 years). AmpliSeq wholeâ€transcriptome sequencing was performed on extracted RNA. Differential expression, clustering/pathway analyses, immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens, and clinical trait correlations were performed. Results: Skin tape expression profiles were distinct from skin biopsy profiles and better sampled epidermal differentiation complex genes. Skin tape expression of 29 immune and epidermisâ€related genes (false discovery rate < 5%) separated patients with AD from healthy subjects. Agnostic gene set analyses and clustering revealed 50% of patients with AD exhibited a type 2 inflammatory signature (type 2â€“high endotype) characterized by differential expression of 656 genes, including overexpression of IL13, IL4R, CCL22, CCR4 (log2 fold change = 5.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 4.1, respectively) and at a pathway level by TH2/dendritic cell activation. Both expression and immunostaining of skin biopsy specimens indicated this type 2â€“high group was enriched for inflammatory, type 2â€“skewed dendritic cells expressing Fc&egr;RI. The type 2â€“high endotype group exhibited more severe disease by using both the Eczema Area and Severity Index score and body surface area covered by lesions.

Prime examples are biomedical, geophysical, and internet related data. We propose two new approaches to wavelet shrinkage/thresholding. In the spirit of Efron and Tibshirani's recent work on local false discovery rate, we propose Bayesian Local False Discovery Rate (BLFDR), where the underlying model on wavelet coefficients does not assume known variances. This approach to wavelet shrinkage is shown to be connected with shrinkage based on Bayes factors. The second proposal, Bayesian False Discovery Rate (BaFDR), is based on ordering of posterior probabilities of hypotheses on true wavelets coefficients being null, in Bayesian testing of multiple hypotheses. We demonstrate that both approaches result in competitive shrinkage methods by contrasting them to some popular shrinkage techniques.",2008,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ilya Lavrik"", ids = ""40489048""); list(name = ""Yoon Young Jung"", ids = ""50406310""); list(name = ""Fabrizio Ruggeri"", ids = ""31910919""); list(name = ""Brani Vidakovic"", ids = ""1709741"")",1ecab6760e9e779a9690d680c2092157c2d1edb1; b9bb2be0abb770f334effa32ef6cbd9f8d271890; a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c; 39a950f974c9d4f9842462f6b89af382312706b2; b7cdd48ee2cfbf3dd9291ad950100f91481e9f54; a6511b8b1bb67c621bdab348a2dbebf849a22dc4; 6a04cd23986b3a8d970ecaa7b467c7a71beb1143; e8ab01f09dd79aa9589cc80fbecddb8a086e089c; 6ea64d942efc8d89e344ff2789829b77963a1f5f; 4995b117d0b4053b40a944e1adf6bccbce2eb096; db07fd8233f0698826bc753c3f7c6908bc9117c1,b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 148f3a5ca88f6ec1821f71cf257fc0234de21cc5; 60ca0e6986b4c52cd9ee2495bb644d8a7eb24fd8; c9a80fe385d7c40efadcaa901254fbf62bf9ae04; 7b9678a528072d942119df2c4a792c5b0ded81c5; 2cc257b0c7db92f90c3224c35df7b8e85f57a090; 7025bdb9317ac27892f6c0c35befd961c3105224; f69dcc4d0452eeb03f0a0361238334a9110b527f; 1e93d7b303abf70d41372e93e4a9e58d85409531; bf4c8bc8ddba4521eb0955707af4f28b5535658e; d941af770496d214b34c89cf2e391e426ba7fdf2; 93db1679ee1d190193eab879d6771191f0c6c367; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; fce6b49a84dfd1e224bbac2df1bb3d12297407f6; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990,Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation,37,1086 - 1100
b07b618958e82dbf7f55dc351a8a54f3223cf35b,ELM-Based Large-Scale Genetic Association Study via Statistically Significant Pattern,"Genetic association study (GAS) is a promising tool for detecting and analyzing the cause of complex diseases. The extreme learning machine (ELM) has been successfully applied in a variety of research fields. Yet, as a black box method, it could not measure up to the task of GAS by itself, because it cannot tell us what causes the diseases, which is very crucial to the biologists. In this paper, we propose an ELM-based statistically significant pattern classification framework, which combines ELM with feature vector-based methods to solve the GAS problem efficiently and effectively. In particular: 1) a statistically significant pattern considering in terms of both family wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) is proposed to control false positives in multiple hypothesis tests, which is necessary in GAS, but ignored by most of the existing methods; 2) an upper bound of the significance of a pattern is deduced to speed up FWER-constrained statistically significant pattern mining in a row enumeration way. Further, a space-effective grid index is devised to dramatically improves the efficiency of FDR-constrained pattern discovery; and 3) an ELM classifier is constructed based on the significant patterns. Comprehensive empirical studies on four real genotype datasets demonstrate much higher efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed framework with respect to the compared methods.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yuan Li"", ids = ""27775403""); list(name = ""Yuhai Zhao"", ids = ""47827883""); list(name = ""Guoren Wang"", ids = ""8349792""); list(name = ""Zhanghui Wang"", ids = ""2345004""); list(name = ""Min Gao"", ids = ""145414517"")",2ff45d9766fa7f9a65aa93b648bae3b7d8b911e6; 340baaabebeea1f147c06712a3b78bb148de8e12; 64a97629f923d9f352119a6af8ad5597e96b4735; 42adafb78f05d9d8202b575f15a448018ba20140; 5ce8eb4725ccded4a6030e1ae473d36995b78dd4; 3fab761547135187adea1b57c893a9c14e8f1b1e; 2ecd0f927a3bffa31ba4f1500b5cd1b3cf4d7216,,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",49,2175-2188
0d6012c34c23162d4842c43a7b49131a526bcb03,Proteomic distinction of renal oncocytomas and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas,"BackgroundRenal oncocytomas (ROs) are benign epithelial tumors of the kidney whereas chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCCs) are malignant renal tumors. The latter constitute 5â€“7% of renal neoplasias. ROs and chRCCs show pronounced molecular and histological similarities, which renders their differentiation demanding. We aimed for the differential proteome profiling of ROs and early-stage chRCCs in order to better understand distinguishing protein patterns.MethodsWe employed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (six RO cases, six chRCC cases) together with isotopic triplex dimethylation and a pooled reference standard to enable cohort-wide quantitative comparison. For lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and integrin alpha-V (ITGAV) we performed corroborative immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an extended cohort of 42 RO cases and 31 chRCC cases.ResultsAt 1% false discovery rate, we identifiedâ€‰>â€‰3900 proteins, of whichâ€‰>â€‰2400 proteins were consistently quantified in at least four RO and four chRCC cases. The proteomic expression profiling discriminated ROs and chRCCs and highlighted established features such as accumulation of mitochondrial proteins in ROs together with emphasizing the accumulation of endo-lysosomal proteins in chRCCs. In line with the proteomic data, IHC showed enrichment of LAMP1 in chRCC and of ITGAV in RO.ConclusionWe present one of the first differential proteome profiling studies on ROs and chRCCs and highlight differential abundance of LAMP1 and ITGAV in these renal tumors.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vanessa Drendel"", ids = ""7017331""); list(name = ""Bianca Heckelmann"", ids = ""31049896""); list(name = ""Christoph Schell"", ids = ""48903362""); list(name = ""Lucas Kook"", ids = ""51144484""); list(name = ""Martin L.

b0c27620e71112bf89c1fcd06e79c2d7ef343e8f,Dynamic and Physical Clustering of Gene Expression during Epidermal Barrier Formation in Differentiating Keratinocytes,"The mammalian epidermis is a continually renewing structure that provides the interface between the organism and an innately hostile environment. The keratinocyte is its principal cell. Keratinocyte proteins form a physical epithelial barrier, protect against microbial damage, and prepare immune responses to danger. Epithelial immunity is disordered in many common diseases and disordered epithelial differentiation underlies many cancers. In order to identify the genes that mediate epithelial development we used a tissue model of the skin derived from primary human keratinocytes. We measured global gene expression in triplicate at five times over the ten days that the keratinocytes took to fully differentiate. We identified 1282 gene transcripts that significantly changed during differentiation (false discovery rate <0.01%). We robustly grouped these transcripts by K-means clustering into modules with distinct temporal expression patterns, shared regulatory motifs, and biological functions. We found a striking cluster of late expressed genes that form the structural and innate immune defences of the epithelial barrier. Gene Ontology analyses showed that undifferentiated keratinocytes were characterised by genes for motility and the adaptive immune response. We systematically identified calcium-binding genes, which may operate with the epidermal calcium gradient to control keratinocyte division during skin repair. The results provide multiple novel insights into keratinocyte biology, in particular providing a comprehensive list of known and previously unrecognised major components of the epidermal barrier. The findings provide a reference for subsequent understanding of how the barrier functions in health and disease.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer M.

703994d9c0de91777ff741b27c9afa227182a7cf,FDR-controlling stepwise procedures and their false negatives ratesâ˜†,"Abstract The concept of false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected proportion of false positives (type I errors) among rejected hypotheses, has received increasing attention recently by researchers in multiple hypotheses testing. A similar measure involving false negatives (type II errors), which we call the false negatives rate (FNR), is considered and an explicit formula of it is developed for a generalized step-up-step-down procedure in terms of probability distributions of ordered test statistics. It is shown that a step-down procedure can be used to control the FNR under certain conditions on the test statistics. Various FDR-controlling procedures that exist in a given multiple testing situation are further studied in terms of the FNR. In particular, an unbiasedness property is defined for an FDR-controlling multiple testing procedure by the inequality FDR+FNRâ©½1. The FDR-controlling generalized step-up-step-down procedure considered in Sarkar (Ann. Statist. 26 (2002) 239), in particular the Benjamini and Hochberg (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289) step-up procedure, is proved to be unbiased when the test statistics are independent and is conjectured to be so based on simulations when they are dependent. Also conjectured is the unbiasedness of the FDR-controlling Benjamini and Lui (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 82 (1999) 163) step-down procedure with independent as well as dependent test statistics. Different FDR-controlling procedures are investigated based on simulated data from equi-correlated multivariate normals in terms of the quantity 1âˆ’FNRâˆ’FDR that reflects the strength of unbiasedness.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

deed3db4ac71a6dc1cf6f5d965e8c5d0e88f64f4,Multi-resolution localization of causal variants across the genome,"In the statistical analysis of genome-wide association data, it is challenging to precisely localize the variants that affect complex traits, due to linkage disequilibrium, and to maximize power while limiting spurious findings. Here we report on KnockoffZoom: a flexible method that localizes causal variants at multiple resolutions by testing the conditional associations of genetic segments of decreasing width, while provably controlling the false discovery rate. Our method utilizes artificial genotypes as negative controls and is equally valid for quantitative and binary phenotypes, without requiring any assumptions about their genetic architectures. Instead, we rely on well-established genetic models of linkage disequilibrium. We demonstrate that our method can detect more associations than mixed effects models and achieve fine-mapping precision, at comparable computational cost. Lastly, we apply KnockoffZoom to data from 350k subjects in the UK Biobank and report many new findings. GWAS analysis currently relies mostly on linear mixed models, which do not account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between tested variants. Here, Sesia et al. propose KnockoffZoom, a non-parametric statistical method for the simultaneous discovery and fine-mapping of causal variants, assuming only that LD is described by hidden Markov models (HMMs).",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matteo Sesia"", ids = ""1509115362""); list(name = ""Eugene Katsevich"", ids = ""1509108608""); list(name = ""Stephen Bates"", ids = ""153079946""); list(name = ""Emmanuel CandÃ¨s"", ids = ""1509124668""); list(name = ""Chiara Sabatti"", ids = ""2139035"")",,7335660e55f5537dcb09ca29e689211dacffe40e; d38266031970dcb8a336ec4c6f095bd01e1a2d16; 00719c32216fdd88bf2f86951a2c2e155b3e20ed; 36950960d98fb8da5a43b5adc8e33b25d31f1f95; c28c40dd86dc1847cb6b4999c3c1e10437f489a7; 321d136b50d0db07b584bf627d89af52bbbcb71a; cc838a882b254d37f571c234781cfbad1c15227b; 0b256820d1e7d321e227dc41cedf3bb0b0c5d8f4; c14471902f561c2445f7b544ff468d85532426f2; 58011fbddfac4f4d36a0d88150405696d981a8d6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4144262404079fc4044aad441e4efa2ea6a95c04; a9cc79a5df0f7802145401b464e4bb30c23b8efa; 97de476f5d3485f8fe29548ed061355d596f9d81; 049d9f4b56a5ea08a3bef9bfa2c9c4671b8b8564; f8489c1bfdeea2a210fdc27455266dcfc4156874; b4ef47ed4677c58c32adb2f07cd72042a6824106; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 2e2deddaa72ea37f24bd5e0d63c0cb90517fe385; 0efd63ecb2d9f6c7bac14890e8f2974bcc2517e6; a3bceed028964c288d6e25f28e4fdb8b88c41d8e; 46a5cd40ff4b9bc7bbc6e7da0a304b543efc3dd2; d8cfdb075bf76e1ba6279337ac975a1b0d3d55bb; 54e14736e6d6b411530181042f3a39ba85abe1da; a32c1089581ad7acf69576e52ce1b388192542f9; 50b6a37dea80346593c2539245da25291c3678b0; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; d0d3598f6c8ceda3e0a14cb6228d1489b5212e0f; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; 975442cd1c8ae7c251fee585fdf9634ef755afcb; 0baa7d9071f95ca44e1945c70824b6a9ba8197fb; 28c3f90fe9f38b34cbd1d6706517c64c12e80dbe; ae0459f3af3d9d841d4f03c174507523010a408a; f7761d3376749d66fb5eec1bcdfbcc8541548b5e; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; f68fa7852412bcf517a236acdb1ed6a8bf130fe3; 615013cd0b8ef098fbc5041829768f96def3351c; 1fcd8971378cfbfe9d52889493af5c05b9a345e5; b5622ba24a8a2f5ed1e67c5f294476db0423ad35; 6241d9ac2a24852e592a63cc7023017ffe73390c; b3aae0ce0606743f619986499e65742f81347d76; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; 3e8749ebe886d27c37d96f870cf8c841fdb376a1; 582bc5d5e5dc6dcb92e3665a34110ef886a115cc; 98286fedf32652ecdf9f9832f0fd99930bd2a562; 1239b88111a5f1c20622d58406fb15bf02c31947; ff353d02c3bb1cba9d53f6e4466cc9ef2a6a3d52,Nature Communications,11,
974eadbb5dbb0d03f90a39ca22cc570eb563b6c0,Identification of prostate cancer-expressed microRNAs associated with clinical recurrence (cR) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) following radical prostatectomy (RP).,"21 Background: We previously identified messenger RNAs (mRNAs) whose expression can distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancer. Representing multiple key genomic pathways, these mRNAs are significantly associated with cR and PCSS after RP, providing prognostic information beyond PSA, cT stage and Gleason Score. We evaluated microRNA expression in the same specimens for association with cR and PCSS.


METHODS
All cT1/cT2 prostate cancer pts treated with RP at Cleveland Clinic from 1987-2004 were identified (n~2,600), of which 127 pts w/ cR and 374 pts w/o cR after RP were randomly selected using cohort sampling. RNA was purified from 2 macrodissected FPE tumor specimens per pt. Expression of 76 test and 5 reference microRNAs was quantified by RT-PCR. Cox regression and control of the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to assess reference-normalized microRNA and mRNA expression for association with cR and PCSS.


RESULTS
106 pts with cR and 310 without cR had sufficient RNA and successful microRNA assays. Analysis of primary Gleason pattern tumor tissue for each pt identified 21 microRNAs associated with cR and 13 microRNAs associated with PCSS, with FDR at 10%; 8 microRNAs were associated with both endpoints. Similar analysis of highest Gleason pattern tumor tissue for each pt identified 22 microRNAs associated with cR (17 overlapping with those for the primary Gleason pattern) and 7 microRNAs associated with PCSS, with FDR at 10%; 4 were associated with both endpoints. miR-1, miR-21, miR-93, and miR-106b were associated with both cR and PCSS in primary and highest Gleason pattern specimens. The 76 microRNAs in this study tended to have weaker association with cR and PCSS than the 732 mRNAs. In multivariate analyses, mRNAs and microRNAs provided prognostic information beyond PSA, cT stage, and biopsy Gleason score. MicroRNAs co-express more frequently with each other than with mRNAs, which may indicate distinct biological regulation.


CONCLUSIONS

The bootstrap-t-test yielded up to 80% lower FDRs than the alternative statistics, and its FDR was always as good as or better than any of the alternatives. Generally, the predicted FDR from the bootstrapped P-values agreed well with their empirical estimates, except when the number of mRNA samples is smaller than 16. In a cancer data set, the bootstrap-t-test discovered 200 differentially regulated genes at a FDR of 2.6%, and in a knock-out gene expression experiment 10 genes were discovered at a FDR of 3.2%. It is argued that, in the case of microarray data, control of the FDR takes sufficient account of the multiple testing, whilst being less stringent than Bonferoni-type multiple testing corrections.

a02f20b52dbbfd43c132c39f658a7fb5d9d993d2,Practical FDR-based sample size calculations in microarray experiments,"MOTIVATION
Owing to the experimental cost and difficulty in obtaining biological materials, it is essential to consider appropriate sample sizes in microarray studies. With the growing use of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in microarray analysis, an FDR-based sample size calculation is essential.


METHOD
We describe an approach to explicitly connect the sample size to the FDR and the number of differentially expressed genes to be detected. The method fits parametric models for degree of differential expression using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.


RESULTS
The applicability of the method is illustrated with simulations and studies of a lung microarray dataset. We propose to use a small training set or published data from relevant biological settings to calculate the sample size of an experiment.

A hierarchical prior model is based on imposing a prior distribution Â¼(k) on the number of hypotheses arising from alternatives (false nulls). We then apply the maximum a posteriori (MAP) rule to find the most likely configuration of null and alternative hypotheses. The resulting MAP procedure and its closely related step-up and step-down versions compare ordered Bayes factors of individual hypotheses with a sequence of critical values depending on the prior. We discuss the relations between the proposed MAP procedure and the existing frequentist and Bayesian counterparts. A more detailed analysis is given for the normal data, where we show, in particular, that by choosing a specific Â¼(k), the MAP procedure can mimic several known familywise error (FWE) and false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures.

A NOREPOS Study","The aim of this study was to investigate relations between cadmium, lead, and aluminum in municipality drinking water and the incidence of hip fractures in the Norwegian population. A trace metals survey in 566 waterworks was linked geographically to hip fractures from hospitals throughout the country (1994â€“2000). In all those supplied from these waterworks, 5,438 men and 13,629 women aged 50â€“85Â years suffered a hip fracture. Poisson regression models were fitted, adjusting for age, region of residence, urbanization, and type of water source as well as other possibly bone-related water quality factors. Effect modification by background variables and interactions between water quality factors were examined (correcting for false discovery rate). Men exposed to a relatively high concentration of cadmium (IRRâ€‰=â€‰1.10; 95Â % CI 1.01, 1.20) had an increased risk of fracture. The association between relatively high lead and hip fracture risk was significant in the oldest age group (66â€“85Â years) for both men (IRRâ€‰=â€‰1.11; 95Â % CI 1.02, 1.21) and women (IRRâ€‰=â€‰1.10; 95Â % CI 1.04, 1.16). Effect modification by degree of urbanization on hip fracture risk in men was also found for all three metals: cadmium, lead, and aluminum. In summary, a relatively high concentration of cadmium, lead, and aluminum measured in drinking water increased the risk of hip fractures, but the associations depended on gender, age, and urbanization degree. This study could help in elucidating the complex effects on bone health by risk factors found in the environment.",2013,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cecilie Dahl"", ids = ""34674167""); list(name = ""A J SÃ¸gaard"", ids = ""4362144""); list(name = ""Grethe S Tell"", ids = ""2236449""); list(name = ""Trond Peder Flaten"", ids = ""82127628""); list(name = ""Dag Hongve"", ids = ""4820803""); list(name = ""Tone Kristin Omsland"", ids = ""5835630""); list(name = ""Kristin Holvik"", ids = ""4414913""); list(name = ""Haakon E.

44dc704f84b290bbac8c4e9006429233cafec92c,FDR-controlled network modeling and analysis of fMRI and sEMG signals,"Neural recording technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and surface electroencephalography (sEMG) provide great potential to studying the underlying neural systems and the related diseases. A broad range of statistical methods have been developed to model interactions between neural components. In this thesis, a false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled exploratory group modeling approach is introduced to model interaction/cooperation between neural components. Group network modeling for comparison between populations is of great common interest in biomedical signal processing, particularly when there might be considerable heterogeneity within one or more groups, such as disease populations. A group-level network modeling process, the group PCfdr algorithm with taking into account inter-subject variances, is proposed. The group PCfdr algorithm combines group inference with a graphical modeling approach for discovering statistically significant structure connectivity. Simulation results demonstrate that the group PCfdr algorithm can accurately recover the underlying group network structures and robustly control the FDR at user-specified levels. To further extract informative features and compare the connectivity patterns across groups at the network level, network analysis methods including graph theoretical analysis, lesion and perturbation analysis are applied to examine the inferred networks.

Holstein-Friesian bull calves with a mean (Â±S.D.) age and bodyweight of 19 (Â±8.2) days and 47.5 (Â±5.3) kg, respectively, were offered a high (nâ€‰=â€‰10) or low (nâ€‰=â€‰10) plane of nutrition in order to achieve an overall growth rate of 1.2 and 0.5â€‰kg/day. At 126 (Â±3) days of age, calves were euthanized, hypothalamus (arcuate region), anterior pituitary and testicular parenchyma samples were harvested and RNAseq analysis was performed. There were 0, 49 and 1,346 genes differentially expressed in the arcuate nucleus, anterior pituitary and testicular tissue of bull calves on the low relative to the high plane of nutrition, respectively (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05; False Discovery Rate <0.05). Cell cycle processes in the anterior pituitary were down regulated in the low relative to the high plane of nutrition; there was no differential expression of genes related to reproductive processes. Gene expression involved in cholesterol and androgen biosynthesis in the testes were down regulated in animals on the low plane of nutrition. This study provides insight into the effect of early life plane of nutrition on the regulation of the HPT axis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""A M English"", ids = ""143921064""); list(name = ""Collin J.

39f35986b96320cf0911a0d25bb059807d3146fb,Pituitary genomic expression profiles of steers are altered by grazing of high vs. low endophyte-infected tall fescue forages,"Consumption of ergot alkaloid-containing tall fescue grass impairs several metabolic, vascular, growth, and reproductive processes in cattle, collectively producing a clinical condition known as ""fescue toxicosis."" Despite the apparent association between pituitary function and these physiological parameters, including depressed serum prolactin; no reports describe the effect of fescue toxicosis on pituitary genomic expression profiles. To identify candidate regulatory mechanisms, we compared the global and selected targeted mRNA expression patterns of pituitaries collected from beef steers that had been randomly assigned to undergo summer-long grazing (89 to 105 d) of a high-toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue pasture (HE; 0.746 Î¼g/g ergot alkaloids; 5.7 ha; n = 10; BW = 267 Â± 14.5 kg) or a low-toxic endophyte tall fescue-mixed pasture (LE; 0.023 Î¼g/g ergot alkaloids; 5.7 ha; n = 9; BW = 266 Â± 10.9 kg). As previously reported, in the HE steers, serum prolactin and body weights decreased and a potential for hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acid-derived carbons increased. In this manuscript, we report that the pituitaries of HE steers had 542 differentially expressed genes (P < 0.001, false discovery rate â‰¤ 4.8%), and the pattern of altered gene expression was dependent (P < 0.001) on treatment. Integrated Pathway Analysis revealed that canonical pathways central to prolactin production, secretion, or signaling were affected, in addition to those related to corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, melanocyte development, and pigmentation signaling. Targeted RT-PCR analysis corroborated these findings, including decreased (P < 0.05) expression of DRD2, PRL, POU1F1, GAL, and VIP and that of POMC and PCSK1, respectively.

Presently clinical diagnosis and treatment of ADHD relies on behavioral disturbances than on detecting underlying defective brain regions. Therapeutic outcome in treatment of ADHD may be more positive if defective brain region in clinically diagnosed ADHD is detected by voxel based morphometric (VBM) analysis that measures voxel-wise global and regional focal volume differences in structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI) of brain. This study was designed to detect any region-specific gray matter (GM) volume defects in sMRI of ADHD adolescents by VBM analysis. Thirty sMRI datasets matched for sex, handedness of adolescents aged between 11.66 and 20.47 years (mean age 16.27Â±2.48 years) obtained from NeuroImage webpage, were selected (Control n=15; ADHD combined type n=15). These sMRI were analyzed by VBM technique and compared using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Significant regional GM volume deficits (P<0.05) was specifically identified in left cuneus and middle occipital gyrus in ADHD, after voxel-wise false discovery rate correction over the whole brain compared to matched controls.

4a942194b58d3c55ebbd08ddd4b5d2bffac8aac6,Machine Learning By Using False Discovery Rate,"Supervised and unsupervised classification are common topics in machine learning in both scientific and industrial fields, which usually involve three tasks: prediction, exploration, and explanation. False discovery rate (FDR) theory has a close connection to classical classification theory, which must be employed in a sophisticated way to achieve good performance in various contexts. The study aims to explore novel supervised classifiers and unsupervised classification approaches for functional data and high-dimensional data in genome study by using FDR, respectively. One work develops a novel classifier for functional data by casting the classification problem into a multiple testing task, which involves using statistical depth functions. The other two works essentially deal with p-values or tail-areas by using FDR in the large scale testing problem. One work proposes a novel algorithm to yield reproducible differential expression analysis for microarray and RNA-Seq data. The proposed algorithm combines the cross-validation type subsampling and false discovery rate, where the p-values obtained from the training data are used to fit a mixture of baseline and signal distributions by using the EM algorithm, which is in turn used to screen the significance for the p-values obtained from the testing data. Another work proposes a novel weighted p-value approach to explore the association between microRNAs and COPD emphysema severity by regulating the mRNA expressions, while integrating patient phenotype information. This proposed method can be applied to study the causality between miRNA and any particular disease, by exploring the precise role of miRNA in regulating genes.",2018,,"list(name = ""Chong Ma"", ids = ""48168024"")",,,,,
c82a3a9975dc8568aae26b8c4ffd6183ba143759,P14.1 Non-invasive cortical stimulation enhances lower limb function in chronic stroke patients,"Introduction: Recent fMRI studies (Owen et al, Science, 2006; Monti et al, NEJM 2010) showed the possibility to use the voluntary modulation of mental states for detecting the residual level of awareness in patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) and for implementing tools for binary communication. Objectives: In order to transfer the paradigms used in fMRI to the more portable EEG technique, this study aims at investigating the possibility to retrieve distinguishable activation patterns during different imagery tasks, by using advanced high resolution EEG methodology in the time and frequency domains. Methods: 61-channels EEG was recorded from 15 healthy volunteers during the execution of three imagery tasks, Playing Tennis (T), Prolonged Grasping (G) and Spatial Navigation in a domestic environment (N), and during Relax (R). EEG traces were projected on a cortical model by solving the electromagnetic linear inverse problem. Power Spectrum Density was computed on cortical waveforms and averaged in four frequency bands (Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma). T-tests for a significance level of 5%, corrected with False Discovery Rate, were performed for T-R, N-R and G-R comparisons and mapped on a cortical model. Results: Statistical maps showed a partial spatial overlapping between cortical areas involved in the execution of the three imagery tasks (T, G, N). However, the specific contribution in different frequency bands (Alpha for the two motor tasks and Beta for the navigation task) allows to separate the imaginative tasks. Conclusions: Results suggest that the high resolution EEG spectral mapping can be an effective way to address the analysis of imaginative functions, allowing to discriminate different mental states without the limitations of the use of an fMRI scanner, with important implications for DOC oriented Brain Computer Interface applications.

73f5e4a0d4cd3dc764476a54f0deb3ea81a784db,Independent component analysis for the extraction of reliable protein signal profiles from MALDI-TOF mass spectra,"MOTIVATION
Independent component analysis (ICA) is a signal processing technique that can be utilized to recover independent signals from a set of their linear mixtures. We propose ICA for the analysis of signals obtained from large proteomics investigations such as clinical multi-subject studies based on MALDI-TOF MS profiling. The method is validated on simulated and experimental data for demonstrating its capability of correctly extracting protein profiles from MALDI-TOF mass spectra.


RESULTS
The comparison on peak detection with an open-source and two commercial methods shows its superior reliability in reducing the false discovery rate of protein peak masses. Moreover, the integration of ICA and statistical tests for detecting the differences in peak intensities between experimental groups allows to identify protein peaks that could be indicators of a diseased state. This data-driven approach demonstrates to be a promising tool for biomarker-discovery studies based on MALDI-TOF MS technology.

We and others have demonstrated strong enrichment of such single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), supporting an important role for regulatory genetic variation in complex disease pathogenesis. Herein we describe our initial efforts to develop a predictive model of disease-associated variants leveraging eQTL information. We first catalogued cis-acting eQTLs (SNPs within 100 kb of target gene transcripts) by meta-analyzing four studies of three blood-derived tissues (n = 586). At a false discovery rate < 5%, we mapped eQTLs for 6,535 genes; these were enriched for disease-associated genes (P < 10(-04)), particularly those related to immune diseases and metabolic traits. Based on eQTL information and other variant annotations (distance from target gene transcript, minor allele frequency, and chromatin state), we created multivariate logistic regression models to predict SNP membership in reported GWAS. The complete model revealed independent contributions of specific annotations as strong predictors, including evidence for an eQTL (odds ratio (OR) = 1.2-2.0, P < 10(-11)) and the chromatin states of active promoters, different classes of strong or weak enhancers, or transcriptionally active regions (OR = 1.5-2.3, P < 10(-11)). This complete prediction model including eQTL association information ultimately allowed for better discrimination of SNPs with higher probabilities of GWAS membership (6.3-10.0%, compared to 3.5% for a random SNP) than the other two models excluding eQTL information. This eQTL-based prediction model of disease relevance can help systematically prioritize non-coding GWAS SNPs for further functional characterization.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Damien Croteau-Chonka"", ids = ""1401202455""); list(name = ""Angela J Rogers"", ids = ""35113854""); list(name = ""Towfique Raj"", ids = ""144837819""); list(name = ""Michael J.

Knowing where alterations in brain function are located is crucial to understanding the disease effect. The anatomical distribution of neurotransmitter receptors is now often studied using quantitative autoradiography, but the large number of brain regions involved raises serious problems for statistical analysis of such data. Due to the dependence among the subjects in case control designs, statistical analysis based on a 'mixed model' is useful. Such an analysis is illustrated using a small autoradiographic data set. The Bonferroni method, the method of Holm, and two 'False Discovery Rate'-controlling methods for adjusting P-values for multiple comparisons are compared.",2000,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Steven P.

96f9f7ddce258fc85e3b1532b7471e2c4c640fd7,Properties of average score distributions of SEQUEST: the probability ratio method.,"High throughput identification of peptides in databases from tandem mass spectrometry data is a key technique in modern proteomics. Common approaches to interpret large scale peptide identification results are based on the statistical analysis of average score distributions, which are constructed from the set of best scores produced by large collections of MS/MS spectra by using searching engines such as SEQUEST. Other approaches calculate individual peptide identification probabilities on the basis of theoretical models or from single-spectrum score distributions constructed by the set of scores produced by each MS/MS spectrum. In this work, we study the mathematical properties of average SEQUEST score distributions by introducing the concept of spectrum quality and expressing these average distributions as compositions of single-spectrum distributions. We predict and demonstrate in the practice that average score distributions are dominated by the quality distribution in the spectra collection, except in the low probability region, where it is possible to predict the dependence of average probability on database size. Our analysis leads to a novel indicator, the probability ratio, which takes optimally into account the statistical information provided by the first and second best scores. The probability ratio is a non-parametric and robust indicator that makes spectra classification according to parameters such as charge state unnecessary and allows a peptide identification performance, on the basis of false discovery rates, that is better than that obtained by other empirical statistical approaches. The probability ratio also compares favorably with statistical probability indicators obtained by the construction of single-spectrum SEQUEST score distributions. These results make the robustness, conceptual simplicity, and ease of automation of the probability ratio algorithm a very attractive alternative to determine peptide identification confidences and error rates in high throughput experiments.",2008,Biology; Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Salvador MartÃ­nez-BartolomÃ©"", ids = ""1401305323""); list(name = ""Pedro Navarro"", ids = ""145591913""); list(name = ""Fernando MartÃ­n-Maroto"", ids = ""1401645281""); list(name = ""Daniel Lopez-Ferrer"", ids = ""1401634554""); list(name = ""AntÃ³nio Ramos-FernÃ¡ndez"", ids = ""1397803748""); list(name = ""Margarita Villar"", ids = ""2925466""); list(name = ""Josefa PredestinaciÃ³n GarcÃ­a-RuÃ­z"", ids = ""1401072932""); list(name = ""JesÃºs VÃ¡zquez"", ids = ""152495293"")",54cd31fcb3ae4aa7b6d5242103d54466bd550f23; 14cb14ef79cfca69adfa079b806a17d16735bb90; 2e924e42d3f86ae9d57513ceec30bac5e0be47a0; b208a078162f898fe894b36791c0bfd8db71aa92; f393df4bbba1ce50912d84a73255906b168f52df; e2ac09a0dab0b4767a4e98cadb7370c3b3df165e; 6492918286fa1858d7088535a4789423a7e34f38; f1e69063b15769e3638ac35972148cb527f172e1; e5908569b96278f16c9a6ab56a4b0d0dcb9f83e4; 7a21532ac4e0b61ae126754c9312d78dfa356874; 8ae7c85bc97cee87f4599f47efc75d4a4d1cb0dc; 4a7bc5481186299e532137c35e35cf2319aca6e1; 18e7c92d74e762e790dc82e3eba983e48d4971aa; 3d52e942bb724798ec00919e9f834a4d4850319b; 845a5872f734c4178f5858483f00961f981fa571; 64358ca8b1c7696d20faf8030334df17887a8e23; 432e56f238f0b781fb9a2d10063a9d5a98930d18; 4e1951e4f2528417a97d80de9b819648cf144737; ef7da80794713df38307050bc4c1759f8da8b204; 5d32703bf686df7889386248e6f46a0c4a0b6c8e; f055cb74e999ce93000aa7d743e26fc004362d14; 127754d8681f91fba122cdce1c55c4658efd08af; d05eff09e4402667a696074a231c87b62750c9d4; cf24c819d5bb518bdce05aca32a2d42aa2cc99b7; acfb34213addfa90ffc19ef4f219792ebde5b3da; 3de2df0deb8d8f8f9d7787ff010cd407890bb199; 8efa082b31c38faa0551df3aae0f2287395a6ec8; d6b2d54151e00b1215061dcde87cf146da5d61d7; 84e1aa17d2f19c123bc937f344d4785800d5aa49; e6dcc4702504d4588cc13ea734d3524aa3d58475; 44f0b71853658a34bb038be11da352a54ed96c28; 7001a4515f9547470848b13c9f3e141489c81c68; ce0051f3293d7668c6199fa34118ee1301c638d8; 441129629cb3c3ee104bbff6109add279293efed; d94fccceb29355607b1c378303e350bb35a7c86c; 62df65a688cc355328443590d78cd765851e1e4e; fbfbc9ef06d78dfb5a33f0abc7ca49309b9168c2; 1b9d5dbaa4bea586a8a68acad794b4359550b994; 0bac03ae2b8f420c5863e5bb4df93215c0e1218d; b3b747bc43003f18e7468116f257368841fd95cd; 3e2589785139ea126722e5c379c7976f68d22983; 591407aaee13620ebb0d7138563f06051cc118fb; fbc6427f95e4779b926e7e50d921cc0f5d79729c; 890eb6f711e593c88f65f0256903f00bc4904971; bf707b6b130d5b5a1fbb180925cef1811d7ad7ab; 5995a40a2ec6f86e2095df8244d23902434552ad; eea8ffcbd7d006da3664dd30fb662d18b7d2bc8f; 362049557df1985f132e2a078df97e7477fdec1d; af7bf9b1a6ec1335cbf64ab1815bdad5d33a9b29; a87d43b5d4902ec4831556497ccd1587ec3dae30; 9854c642b5a5999e9a6febbf1ac0fd603c24785e; a83cdf7126efa61bac2dde04bae884f005d8f903; 989b9bd66fecdf62494a1aef6c721dea257b169b; 1f7b2333ef4231dc1ac8311358c8d49800809756; c773a0114e20c1cb8a94186c9a285d0d307af837; 2db4184a9defac27c39a10703254c7285c53cd42; bfaf760ed0ac82fd9b8150aaf30841ece4698e77; a380161af0d41f413040859bfa0a24aa68dc3fc0; 40f1b2df7d6d3f1374c7846a3eb341c5e3ec000b,b6befcbd40dfdf3341ce5dd9e805f1b2a177cde4; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; d2e507cdafdeee727e28785d77986bcdc725152a; 67efb8c1eb6fb2227528db74b79ee40fa8fa4ba4; c95771022af8d9debb3f324c04eb2fde22955ee0; 6749b99ce6ff63bc2dff6613fd6042e9c552cd2a; dbf1b4409476136941a1f2ac63710a957d2a6406; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; abb87df03afbab087a59c5ff24aabd3a0e194503; 3dd9d4acf562f930bcbcb1e4b528bf2922f010de; 52e816081593eed07cac8b5bdf0d67d6ec14dc40; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; 9b8ed151cf6caa4260796e5b8e0b39164017b3c2; 62b6ea4ee2cdef01c047dcf12018567219298b88; 91c0b9d15f41833c21492a1fb61e65ec8d29e213; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 515b21be02a525b8364a2ec438ad30f903e62dbc; 22f3798827f9ef80a2eef6960d34233d791ccadb; 68b168879846d6214add0e93125cc8b8fef3d0fd; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 85675f464599530e0cf6612991f6bb498e4e8574; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; cd376fa07db404eac4b78ebe4e99a1c75d774642; 84663029e53cf8a42d5dc5d052e1c052eaf20708; 97af12dbc78509d4f0de368bbe242e525cba1293; 786dea548e208bf84de368d452f1cf5acb91ee3c; 3d744cf9d758aa51e47a946af4447daf26cec1d6; 68d5610b0eab933543da3212a074c743c756a0a7; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 5916ac593420f111c4b30ac13cae9610518ebe1a; 726ccdbe2c358b454b510e57987bde7a5c796346; 100f4767f087e858976013b7117f38d26bb32a66; c66e5e48c34647d64a0e9ff334323ed7010e4dd5; 48db31e1e79e823bbd807bcb544c8cc502d65209; 64c1b6c4b4b027c5b1b89023b9a135797c8098fe,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,7 6,"

f51f67f4bba8816f40db65ed98defb6e453da8f6,Leveraging GWAS data to identify metabolic pathways and networks involved in maize lipid biosynthesis,"Maize (Zea mays mays) oil is a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) and energy, making it a valuable resource for human food, animal feed, and bio-energy. Although this trait has been studied via conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS), the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-trait associations generated by GWAS may miss the underlying associations when traits are based on many genes, each with small effects that can be overshadowed by genetic background and environmental variation. Detecting these SNPs statistically is also limited by the levels set for false discovery rate. A complementary pathways analysis that emphasizes the cumulative aspects of SNP-trait associations, rather than just the significance of single SNPs, was performed to understand the balance of lipid metabolism, conversion, and catabolism in this study. This pathway analysis indicated that acyl-lipid pathways, including biosynthesis of wax esters, sphingolipids, phospholipids and flavonoids, along with FA and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, were important for increasing oil and FA content.

92258218ceabb3ddf8f4e24347d6bae5127236b8,Cytokine array comparisons of plasma from cycling fertile women on cycle day 5 and ovulation.,"PROBLEM
To identify plasma immuno-regulatory molecules up or down regulated between the follicular phase and ovulation of the human menstrual cycle.


METHOD OF STUDY
RayBio cytokine arrays were used to screen 174 immuno-regulatory molecules in plasma collected during the follicular phase at menstrual cycle day 5 and at ovulation from five healthy, non-smoking, fertile women of reproductive age not using hormonal contraception.


RESULTS
A total of 23 differentially expressed molecules were found: 10 molecules were differentially up-regulated and 13 down-regulated at ovulation compared with that at the follicular phase (alpha = 0.05, false discovery rate of 0.45).


CONCLUSION
Circulating immuno-regulatory molecules fluctuate over the menstrual cycle in healthy women. The combination of differentially expressed molecules suggests roles in cyclical regulation of angiogenesis and immune cell trafficking.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kota Hatta"", ids = ""4203883""); list(name = ""Michael Bilinski"", ids = ""48888738""); list(name = ""J.

c59b47a2d0e29295b6e5559b22eb18f4a8bc0b6b,Persistent prostate-specific antigen expression after neoadjuvant androgen depletion: an early predictor of relapse or incomplete androgen suppression.,"OBJECTIVES
To analyze post-androgen depletion (AD) primary tumors to identify markers of treatment failure because AD does not reduce the probability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after prostatectomy.


METHODS
Tumors removed by radical prostatectomy after 3 months of AD from 21 patients were analyzed for gene expression using oligonucleotide arrays. Differences between patients with and without relapse were identified using a conservative significance criteria of a threefold change and delta 0.68, ensuring a false discovery rate of less than 11%.


RESULTS
At 50 months of follow-up, 7 of the 18 evaluable patients developed a biochemical recurrence. Gleason grade, pretherapy PSA level, T stage, and margin status were similar between the two groups. Patients with recurrence had greater post-AD PSA levels than those without recurrence (0.87 versus 0.19 ng/mL; P = 0.042). Gene expression analysis revealed 35 probe sets overexpressed in tumors from patients who relapsed. Among the highest ranked probe sets were PSA and other androgen-responsive genes. Serum PSA values during AD revealed similar findings. After 40 days of AD, the PSA level in those without recurrence was 1.21 ng/mL versus 4.5 ng/mL in those with recurrence (P = 0.0034). Immunohistochemistry of post-AD tumors also demonstrated a high PSA staining intensity in many tumors that recurred relative to those that didn't.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of our study show that early recurrence is associated with expression of androgen-responsive genes. Surprisingly, these could be identified as early as 3 months after the initiation of AD therapy. Whether this represents a failure to abrogate androgen receptor mediated signaling with androgen depletion or early reactivation of signaling is under study.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Charles J.

781204d19e190137515466c3f8b124de268f6f3e,Interpretation of published meta-analytical studies affected by implementation errors in the GingerALE software,"GingerALE (http://brainmap.org/ale/) is a widely used, freely distributed software package used to undertake co-ordinate based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of neuroimaging data. The developers of the software (Eickhoff et al., 2017) have recently reported their discovery of two implementation errors which affected versions of the software prior to version 2.3.6 (released in April 2016). These errors, which have been discussed previously in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews (Tanasescu et al., 2015; Tench et al., 2016) affected the multiple comparisons correction procedure resulting in the application of more liberal statistical thresholds than should have been the case. The first error, involving calculation of the threshold for the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, was amended in GingerALE V2.3.3 (May, 2015) but affected all earlier versions of the software. The second error, in the cluster-level Familywise Error (FWE) correction process dating from V2.2 (May 2012), was corrected in April 2016 in V2.3.6. Several hundred published meta-analysis studies (http://www. brainmap.org/pubs/) have used versions of the GingerALE software affected by these errors. This number includes two neuroimaging metaanalyses by the present authors, published before the errors came to light (Garrison et al., 2013; Zmigrod et al., 2016). The GingerALE developers have recommended that the authors of affected studies repeat their analyses with the latest version of the software, and compare their results with the original findings (Eickhoff et al., 2017). Consistent with a few other authors of studies that used versions of GingerALE now known to have been affected by these implementation errors (e.g. Smith and Delgado, 2017), we have done this, and we summarise our findings below. We also use our experience to make suggestions for the interpretation of other published meta-analytical studies affected by the GingerALE software errors, and discuss the implications for interpreting statistical analyses more generally that may be affected by similar problems relating to the use of non-open-source, third party software products. The implementation error in the GingerALE FDR code affected calculation of the statistical threshold for determining activation significance, meaning that clusters that would otherwise have been excluded were falsely shown to have achieved significance (Eickhoff et al., 2017). Importantly, this error did not affect the calculation of individual activation likelihood effect sizes, nor the application of the statistical threshold once it had been calculated. As such, reported uncorrected ALE p values calculated from the modelled activation maps are unaffected, as are the peak locations identified in the analysis, with the implementation error impacting only on which peaks were designated as being significantly above threshold (Eickhoff et al., 2017). However, the scale of the error is variable and dependent on the particular properties of the data, being affected by both the number of neuroimaging experiments in the dataset and the number of foci in each experiment: smaller datasets being typically more affected than larger ones (Eickhoff et al., 2016; M Fox. personal communication). The effect of correcting this error on data from our two published ALE analyses was a large reduction in the number of clusters that exceeded the statistical threshold. Our first study, a meta-analysis of neuroimaging data relating to prediction error in reinforcement learning (Garrison et al., 2013), was based on a full dataset of 35 experiments and 445 foci. The significance threshold used, FDR correction with p < .05, implemented in GingerALE V2.1.1, pN (a conservative setting making no assumption about data correlation), and a minimum cluster size of 50 mm, had been chosen to mirror similar meta-analyses published a few years previously (e.g. Liu et al., 2010). Re-analysis of the prediction error data revealed that for the top level â€˜All Studiesâ€™ prediction error analysis, only four of the originally reported 33 activation peaks survived correction using these FDR settings when implemented in the corrected version of the software (GingerALE V2.3.6). The impact of the error on smaller datasets was similar, so for example only three activation peaks survived for the instrumental and reward analyses using these FDR settings (previously 21 peaks each). In light of current arguments that FDR may not, in any event, be an optimal correction method for ALE analyses (Eickhoff et al., 2016, 2012), we further analysed the All-Studies prediction error data with GingerALE V2.3.6 using FWE voxel correction (p < 0.05), and cluster-level FWE correction (cluster-forming threshold of p < .001, cluster-level correction of p < 0.05) as recommended in the GingerALE manual (http://www.brainmap.org/ale/manual.pdf). Four activation peaks survived correction using FWE and five for cluster level correction.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jane R.

cf417221b16360811ea635cf17fb09db6efe7234,A Comparaison of Methods for Detection of High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in Human Intacerberal EEG Recordings,"High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs) in the range of 80-500Hz seem to be a reliable bio marker of tissue capable of producing seizures. Visual marking of HFOs related to long duration/multi channel EEG data is extremely tedious, highly time-consuming and inevitably subjective. Therefore, automated and reliable detection of HFOs is much more efficient. The purpose of the present study is to improve in the first stage three existing HFOs detectors (CM V, MP, BMT), and subsequently compare them on the same database. Our main findings are summarized as follows: The efficiency of methods depends on the required sensitivity and the False Discovery Rate (FDR). First, if the required sensitivity below 87% is sufficient for the intended application, CM V method could perform well in terms of low false detection rate (FDR<14%). Secondly, if the application requires a sensitivity between 87% and 92%, the three methods could perform in a similar way in terms of performance, wh ich appro ximately corresponds to an FDR in the range of 14-19%. Finally, if a high sensitivity is required (92% up to 98%), BMT based method can be considered the most efficient and leads to significantly lower FDR values (19% to 23%) co mpared to other methods.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sahbi Chaibi"", ids = ""2716472""); list(name = ""Tarek Lajnef"", ids = ""2274531""); list(name = ""Zied Sakka"", ids = ""3300498""); list(name = ""Mounir Samet"", ids = ""3146042""); list(name = ""Abdennaceur Kachouri"", ids = ""2480885"")",2fcaf2eb632d263e554be3ee6131d77c06dc8ae4; 7c2f484cb5eb651ad951426993ec3683c4f2bc4f; abb9caade2d8255172967136b4d136cc35669ede; 6650892e20a8174a6f7b741e9246bb8dd31bd366; 8ab979b9fcb6b4ea1f0e8f5658d20fb59221bfda; fb0019f73dfdae59941666a77ef83054408e571d; 2e0048828698276dd12b2e126b78b2001276ddab; a31b7f3b375e105f5192fd1c1e80fe27d7332926; cb209d43f272e1ab5fc73ac6be0e68e7f88297a5; a176b8f1db79a1bc27f93698583a378cefc3f168; 7703388f2fba69b89f4023647f9a1b93a5ec9bf5,e8473ec38dda4df2b5805765db1291fdc331f3d3; 65fdb549c41cddb3161bc496e056b20088b3d06f; 78b188789b88f6cac5a7ffd6a2cd9e63b4e211e1; 43ddd7ab91dcfd0f3df8fa8021b0f8827cb75d9b; d2a3184cdafcc0b04034a087570a29fddf98e18f; 63b55ac9e21012fc480fe2d0c3206e651749fbd7; 4d0d8f7ae1d8a440a8085ac1bdb993623c99919b; e90bfdd440d5fece5b036a0787fd45ec62b3ecaf; b09e0dc4323f323bfa0f86ffe4f98d30e82664df; 5aca12624bb642a679233effe2694a8ea4e1f9b0; 58531c4a1ee60cab0fbe08207e6a0e0ee3cdaae2; 2bcd45cc669b9b7c7259f5fe35dd87317a0290e1; 09b3c396d9a5b59057c7514ad41afbbfac9c7444; 0041bd02fa5a12457f8e35a3259b58d0c16fabf2; 264e7c98b125e7936354b8a74482b0602262216a; 063cba8d4853f833140f6b1c487acc20d4aa5960; 004068aae65d0813a88e4f614f876d0983e57984; 97c24b226be80036d6cd44de1e78de4393506633; b0154c5510d28f7901e2f127b647d9ed67cda581; bcc26f007a8fececc658ce856cd7088fce271f36; 603c50b3ab30e4b4b04f0a3b53d6172c7910e5de; 2210a7157565422261b03cf2cdf4e91b583df5a0,,3,25-34
f6bd102c5921afeb197ab78f708b2f5c2abc9a7c,Lower total cerebral arterial flow contributes to cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis patients,"Background: The cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients declines with aging, longer disease duration, and possibly cardiovascular comorbidities. Objectives: We investigated whether lower total cerebral arterial blood flow (CABF) measured at the level of the carotid and vertebral arteries may contribute to worse cognitive performance in 132 MS patients and 47 healthy controls. Methods: Total CABF was evaluated with extracranial Doppler, whereas structural T2-lesion volume (LV) and gray matter volume (GMV) were measured on 3T MRI. The cognitive performance was assessed by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Brief Visuospatial Memory Testâ€”Revised (BVMT-R), and California Verbal Learning Testâ€”Second Edition (CVLT-II). Analysis of covariance, partial correlation, and regression models were used to test the differences between study groups and cognition/CABF correlations. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected (Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg) p-values (i.e. q-values) less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Association between lower total CABF and the lower cognitive performance was observed only in MS patients (râ€‰=â€‰0.318, qâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and râ€‰=â€‰0.244, qâ€‰=â€‰0.012 for SDMT and BVMT-R, respectively). Lower GMV, higher T2-LV, and CABF were significantly associated with poorer performance on the processing speed measure of SDMT (adjusted R2â€‰=â€‰0.295, t-statisticsâ€‰=â€‰2.538, standardized Î²â€‰=â€‰0.203, and qâ€‰=â€‰0.020), but not with memory tests. Cognitively impaired MS patients had lower total CABF compared to cognitively preserved (884.5 vs 1020.2 mL/min, qâ€‰=â€‰0.008). Conclusion: Cognitively impaired MS patients presented with lower total CABF. Altered CABF may be a result of reduced metabolic rate and might contribute to abnormal cognitive aging in MS.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dejan Jakimovski"", ids = ""5855155""); list(name = ""Ralph R H Benedict"", ids = ""153251377""); list(name = ""Karen Marr"", ids = ""49446276""); list(name = ""Sirin Gandhi"", ids = ""47997706""); list(name = ""Niels P Bergsland"", ids = ""2599672""); list(name = ""Bianca Weinstock-Guttman"", ids = ""1400467673""); list(name = ""Robert Zivadinov"", ids = ""2974446"")",418fa637248c06d92f40cee281ccff68cfa81773; b613b57f05eac67d294c1d1cb0c5f70f48d8e04a; cd8431441fdf90d708c4261bbf56b2fd18934b35; 4ac2f1cac3b78c375ccf40c37f3cc8edd758fac7,783e10f1de7b15b8a54cceeccb68ffc47cded0c5; c17636ce652df4616bda737b67da9b117d0d90ec; d295252063c96ecad04165a7471700a5fc55cf3f; 4ae4f9e78debd792ff1fd6ed52b9e828a362a6ae; 5b026beaf29a81411fb232ac310693d1fb9b55cf; 899058dc8bcc0a5c21f9b819658f5e317c0dedb4; 8b63853683b5cfce613cc8256b0da2df944176ed; 22d31d11e02ba907760be23c100835f14e7cc338; bd7c1c31da330299d961192f1c52ae9c17b2b93c; b88d4399d262b8c816fd04da82778790b1d02132; 62d4364a43da9470920a758cb5c22fcb4816653f; d9b33c08aa264e7e19d16dbe7bb01478363b7d0b; 74a38adc0034bbcec0f43553b1c8829f4f60b76e; eb1c60b01de5be0e7f1370130e6079256e9a857a; e7ff095731a9ae9acc071097418dd071702ea188; 53d0e6409452742f41f0d36876b523ab6f3636fc; 2ebec39c570db0d853ba6036d0d0eff7372c15ad; b93b1869f491cce62779155bedbacf6e385a7dbc; 4ca06c78d79660a918854dbcef3ec3f2dff72b6e; a237be57357c2f77048bce94fd281475d16d65c6; 8cfcc09912b538ded4ca905df9f2af338aba44ab; 1edace760bec46538c68bbaec4d1d1092d5ecada; 7e3369c9525f8c34d9dd226f2c7706cb945fb1f6; 4647d1b6e07fbc3eb253f593c7945e8538c7f44c; 96732615a5229d6941b2752c7867fd5909598e95; 84c62598139b35d78efd72f4a66a652bd547f796; 35519949cfcfed2127c4f57ecfc7338e347e994e; c585fb2e58c16f52df8e561c4303f0ead8620898; 33fe8dde7f9a54bf3eafb228110d7507fb182910; 2d51e864df74f04e5b82fda8dcba20f0d78ccaf1; 9025060ea93c255ee36152359003596e8a55873f; c20f30dada76b3cf4724d5f5b9a1daf531482e6c; b396dacf9f1022e2a211da052c7ec41d1006c60f; 9fb89570154e5d5e56fdfce29bfcf2dd03cfadd0; 24a375fc4e055542a818cdea25e94316f5bbec2b; ba156363bc33ee9070ff27a94096900a31f3f739; 9310c69e96604b385c41d505278845e183c7ac00; a188561d7e619c7be7f7eaaeaa3c1dde7a58c212,Multiple Sclerosis Journal,26,201 - 209

7a3754cf4d15203e3b10e1dadb1ccd11bddbf109,"Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model. Rejoinder.","The classic frequentist theory of hypothesis testing developed by Neyman, Pearson, and Fisher has a claim to being the Twentieth Centuryâ€™s most influential piece of applied mathematics. Something new is happening in the Twenty-First Century: high throughput devices, such as microarrays, routinely require simultaneous hypothesis tests for thousands of individual cases, not at all what the classical theory had in mind. In these situations empirical Bayes information begins to force itself upon frequentists and Bayesians alike. The two-groups model is a simple Bayesian construction that facilitates empirical Bayes analysis. This article concerns the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas in the two-groups setting, with particular attention focussed on Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s False Discovery Rate method. Topics include the choice and meaning of the null hypothesis in large-scale testing situations, power considerations, the limitations of permutation methods, significance testing for groups of cases (such as pathways in microarray studies), correlation effects, multiple confidence intervals, and Bayesian competitors to the two-groups model.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bradley Efron"", ids = ""47537846"")",274a7cee3869bbdfecd3e239f3f168a55c8f03bf; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; 7e99908dff899e1c744cdf928a1f1ab3ec58cdd4; b02583325ca64903c4328ecc688bcb4cc3131a94; e0a6e9054f97a6ab8592052460b4b84297233e99; 933d9b7b9a2676a9bbe70101b98f13870593d2e3; 8b097b03c9e381fb77a13727380593a853f0a8f0; 3120e78cfb72cad6bc6335c6483c6014b6e920eb; 978fbfc88683be9074d384957d2db4ccc921d7ff; ec964417bb6a279c78bc0026edff62f649924886; 4e56ab1afd8a515a0a0b351fbf1b1d08624d0cc2; c1eb714be7ad2f81719f2de173c5bde31bd05b8d; 2c44934e3260fedd1672581805ff328cade714ed; 1f2a3e620a9f8de6010dbcfb124014d7d7532630; f271f2446062272066bd2c273ff4c6188eadac6e; 18efdd97521a315d4916549901a27ab90a766417; 28452517bca89c32c118e40a89aa77d55e07eaa4; 5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22; 1606ba8d8af181d21705130b2f1913557894e719; aecc5c59958d72d48cb97bef9a8dbb60feb10a5a; df0d15f790ab3fe5adba8523b4a8897cbf44a03e,47774e9ac7ef9601024d2d9717a2869024af7a6b; f916a3916aa0846480f60743b889377534807107; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fdc2b0b00d520ab8d7c3fd20e0e2b763fa285503; 08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236; f9012f9c0fc9c44b759e42cda68d0a4b3af1f48d; d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; ecf16153da2bfbd534b5ae7ad868e886c3296eef; dc1f22cfff1672cf000c48d47e2ce1cb1b25c660; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 1c7ffc9b8da5873f06a3edc4448f80a01f174aeb; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; e090e8cac0b2c79f3d53f6d61952bbd2d5d69c86; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; d5dd1bfb00d973afe5d8ff3495180b59dbe02cfb; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 95b1ddb21d6a0b66176ac3a9489e6e352d4eb697; 23b18d769284a6ddf8bd88d22adda4e79d7600f6; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; 7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7; c7f4cf43304a470bbc7dabb40fd7b3c4d14c83f2; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 1d5b3054f267584dc5a730e9e3754b682d7888b8; 04ccf34db2eae9ab0bda17c1957cdf480d9f0a42; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 44f61f761aab0a2677c6f9cf84e1dbbe442cae2c; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 1746ef5dd71d1c7e3b41fb59d06f7970d19a16d6; 45176c547ebcf17b622c2b5357f802b046c03b9e; 7a6d37a7276cf5e13447bc58f08addf31fd25352; 3bd33278fbf267741659270f4adc00f730d9b703; 4d6b423bda8656d8d46e5fde5ad833f97e278028; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc,Statistical Science,,45-47
460d5905d9c7524fe64eb3396e5f0354c0dbcd7b,A new classification approach based on geometrical model for human detection in images,"In recent years, object detection and classification has gained more attention, thus, there are several human object detection algorithms being used to locate and recognize human objects in images. The research of image processing and analysing based on human shape is a hot topic due to its wide applicability in real applications. In this research, we present a new shape-based classification approach to categorise the detected object as human or non-human in images. The classification in this approach is based on applying a geometrical model which contains a set of parameters related to the objectâ€™s upper portion. Based on the result of these geometric parameters, our approach can simply classify the detected object as human or non-human. In general, the classification process of this new approach is based on generating a geometrical model by observing unique geometrical relations between the upper portion shape points (neck, head, shoulders) of humans, this observation is based on analysis of the change in the histogram of the x values coordinates for human upper portion shape. To present the changing of X coordinate values we have used histograms with mathematical smoothing functions to avoid small angles, as the result we observed four parameters for human objects to be used in building the classifier, by applying the four parameters of the geometrical model and based on the four parameters results, our classification approach can classify the human object from another object. The proposed approach has been tested and compared with some of the machine learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model, and a famous type of decision tree called Random Forest, by using 358 different images for several objects obtained from INRIA dataset (set of human and non-human as an object in digital images). From the comparison and testing result between the proposed approach and the machine learning approaches in term of accuracy performance, we indicate that the proposed approach achieved the highest accuracy rate (93.85%), with the lowest miss detection rate (11.245%) and false discovery rate (9.34%). The result achieved from the testing and comparison shows the efficiency of this presented approach.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""MM Al-N'Awashi"", ids = ""1584105128"")",,e11ae8c1763e00d069705554d31db24cb24b5e80;

b6a13ad60488252bb4cbbef95d4298b65e496b34,A SAS Program to Construct Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Relative Risk,"Assessing adverse effects is critical in any clinical trial or interventional study. Adverse effects for testing a drug/device often involve many clinical symptoms and each patient may experience multiple adverse events. Patients may be lost during follow-up, or their treatments are terminated early given the prospective nature of a clinical trial. Consequently, commonly used SASïƒ’ programs and other statistical packages for analysis of adverse events (AE), which form individual confidence intervals of cumulative incidence based relative risk (RR), are often not adequate and sometimes not appropriate. This paper presents a SAS program which can be used to analyze data with multiple AE by forming simultaneous confidence intervals of incidence density based RR.

c1fa25ea0b8c6265cb30200e858d815c11644b87,Acute alcohol withdrawal and recovery in men lead to profound changes in DNA methylation profiles - a longitudinal clinical study.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Withdrawal is a serious and sometimes life-threatening event in alcohol-dependent individuals. It has been suggested that epigenetic processes may play a role in this context. This study aimed to identify genes and pathways involved in such processes which hint to relevant mechanisms underlying withdrawal.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional case-control study and longitudinal within-cases study during alcohol withdrawal and after two weeks of recovery SETTING: Addiction medicine departments in two university hospitals in southern Germany.


PARTICIPANTS/CASES
Ninety-nine alcohol-dependent male patients receiving inpatient treatment and suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms during detoxification and 95 age-matched male controls.


MEASUREMENTS
Epigenome-wide methylation patterns in patients during acute alcohol withdrawal and after two weeks of recovery, as well as in age-matched controls using Illumina EPIC bead chips. Methylation levels of patients and controls were tested for association with withdrawal status. Tests were adjusted for technical and batch effects, age, smoking, and cell type distribution. Single site analysis as well as an analysis of differentially methylated regions, and gene ontology analysis were performed.


FINDINGS
We found pronounced epigenome-wide significant (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.05) differences between patients during withdrawal and after two weeks (2,876 CpG sites), as well as between patients and controls (9,845 and 6,094 CpG sites comparing patients at time point 1 and patients at time point 2 versus controls, respectively). Analysis of differentially methylated regions and involved pathways revealed an overrepresentation of gene ontology terms related to the immune system response. Differences between patients and controls diminished after recovery (>800 CpG sites less), suggesting a partial reversibility of alcohol- and withdrawal-related methylation.


CONCLUSIONS
Acute alcohol withdrawal in severely dependent male patients appears to be associated with extensive changes in epigenome-wide methylation patterns. In particular, genes involved in immune system response seem to be affected by this condition.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephanie H.

3dcf692f8f01427c85bf4c594e07f68e3d77dac3,Relaxed significance criteria for linkage analysis.,"Linkage analysis involves performing significance tests at many loci located throughout the genome. Traditional criteria for declaring a linkage statistically significant have been formulated with the goal of controlling the rate at which any single false positive occurs, called the genomewise error rate (GWER). As complex traits have become the focus of linkage analysis, it is increasingly common to expect that a number of loci are truly linked to the trait. This is especially true in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL), where sometimes dozens of QTL may exist. Therefore, alternatives to the strict goal of preventing any single false positive have recently been explored, such as the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion. Here, we characterize some of the challenges that arise when defining relaxed significance criteria that allow for at least one false positive linkage to occur. In particular, we show that the FDR suffers from several problems when applied to linkage analysis of a single trait. We therefore conclude that the general applicability of FDR for declaring significant linkages in the analysis of a single trait is dubious. Instead, we propose a significance criterion that is more relaxed than the traditional GWER, but does not appear to suffer from the problems of the FDR. A generalized version of the GWER is proposed, called GWERk, that allows one to provide a more liberal balance between true positives and false positives at no additional cost in computation or assumptions.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lin S.

8d997d3692645b604f99e71d5df33a180ba983cc,Inherited Variants in SULT1E1 and Response to Abiraterone Acetate by Men with Metastatic Castration Refractory Prostate Cancer.,"PURPOSE
Germline variations in genes involved in androgen biosynthesis and metabolic pathways may predict the response to abiraterone acetate in men with metastatic, castration refractory prostate cancer. The variations may serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers to allow for more individualized therapy.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We evaluated 832 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the OmniExpress genotyping platform (IlluminaÂ®) in the boundaries of 61 candidate genes reported to be involved in the androgen metabolic pathway. The purpose was to investigate them for an association with time to treatment failure in 68 white men with metastatic, castration refractory prostate cancer undergoing treatment with abiraterone acetate. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used with Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation as covariates. Each single nucleotide polymorphism was assessed using an allele carriage genetic model in which carriage of 1 or more minor alleles contributes to increased risk. Subset analyses were done to determine whether metastasis site, or prior treatment with ketoconazole or docetaxel would interact with the single nucleotide polymorphisms investigated.


RESULTS
Six single nucleotide polymorphisms in the estrogen sulfotransferase gene SULT1E1 were associated with time to treatment failure on abiraterone acetate therapy after false discovery rate (q value) correction for multiple testing while controlling for Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation (q <0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in SULT1E1 were significantly associated with time to treatment failure in men on abiraterone acetate therapy.

0dea9c36edaceb997cc789645253095373c40657,The Poor Outcome of Multiple Myeloma (MM) Patients Carrying At Diagnosis Deleted TP53 and or Amplified MDM4 Might Be Related to the Deregulation of Genes Involved in Cell Cycle Control and DNA Damage Repair,"Abstract 1810 [][1] 

Background. The efforts to characterize the genomic background of Multiple Myeloma (MM) and to correctly stratify at diagnosis patients (pts) subsequently treated with novel drugs thoroughly meet the clinical requirement to handle highly powerful prognostic factors. On the other hand, the information obtained from each pts needs to be carefully interpreted, by considering the genomic background as a whole, since each aberration might represent the different expression of a common deregulated pathway. The TP53 deletion on chromosome (chr) 17p13 represents one of the genomic aberration most significantly associated with poor outcome in MM. Overall, the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene inactivation has a central role in the tumorigenesis, since p53 is the most frequently mutated protein in human cancers. The p53 pathway silencing might pass also through changes in the expression level or activation of p53 itself, regulated by several specific inhibitors and/or activators. One of the most potent inhibitor of p53 is MDM4, which is critical for control of p53 activity during response to stress and is often amplified in several types of tumors. The MDM4 locus is located on chr1q32.1, a region frequently amplified in MM.

Aim. Since in MM the TP53 deletion on chr 17p13 is reported with low frequencies (7 to 11% at diagnosis) and since the vast majority of hemizygous TP53 deleted pts do not harbor mutations on the allele not affected by the deletion, we sought to investigate the frequency and the prognostic role of TP53 deletion and/or MDM4 amplification in newly diagnosed MM pts, assuming that both of these chromosomal aberrations might contribute to impaired p53 function. All pts have been treated with bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (VTD) as induction therapy prior to, and as consolidation after, double autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT).

Pts and methods. Eighty-nine pts treated with VTD incorporated into double ASCT were analyzed at diagnosis by means of unpaired analysis of copy number alterations (CNA) (Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array), gene expression profile (GEP) (Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 array) and Real-time PCR; the genomic results have been analyzed in the clinical context.

Results. The CNA analysis showed that 9/89 pts (10%) carried a minimal deleted region of 482 Kb on chr17p13.1, including TP53 , and that 27/89 pts (30,3%) carried a minimal amplified region of 1.1 Mb on chr1q32.1 including MDM4 . Pts were stratified into two subgroups according to the presence of amplified MDM4 and/or deleted TP53 (group A, 34 pts, or 38%) or the absence of both these abnormalities (group B, 55 pts, or 62%). Baseline clinical characteristics were homogeneous, except for a higher rate of IgA isotype in group A. On the contrary, groups A and B were clearly imbalanced with respect to the genomic background: indeed, the t(4,14) frequency, as well as the average number of CNAs were overall higher in group A as compared to group B (38% vs. 14% t(4;14) positive, p=0.0002 and 165 vs 103 CNAs, p = 0.03). A GEP comparison among the two groups of pts highlighted an overall deregulation of pathways related to the cell cycle, the DNA damage repair and the cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling, due to the differentiated expression of 627 probes-set in group A vs group B pts (false discovery rate<0.05). The rate of 3near complete response after VTD induction therapy was 38% in group A, as compared to 20% in group B; the presence of TP53 deletion and/or MDM4 amplification correlated with shorter median TTP (40.13 months vs not reached, p=0.005) and OS (57.6 vs not reached, p=0.02). The poorer impact associated with MDM4 amplification was retained also in the absence of TP53 deletion (TTP: 57.6 months vs not reached, p=0.03). Of note, the MDM4 expression, as detected by Real-time PCR in pts carrying amp1q, even if overall higher as compared to negative pts, showed a wide range of expression, with few pts with very low MDM4 expression level.

Conclusions. We observed that pts carrying amplified MDM4 and/or deleted TP53 showed a significantly higher number of CNAs and the deregulation of genes involved in cell cycle control, as compared to pts lacking these chromosomal aberrations. This might account for the worse outcome of this group of pts. The results overall suggest that the involvement of the p53 pathway alteration in MM might be wider than expected, possibly due to the activation negative regulators of p53.

e5628fe48b1243ddc7c9d0c6e19b6c296bdb86fe,Functional Alterations of White Matter in Chronic Never-Treated and Treated Schizophrenia Patients.,"BACKGROUND
Schizophrenia is one of the most severe psychiatric disorders and dysfunction of gray matter (GM) has been usually investigated by resting-state functional (f)MRI. However, functional organization of white matter (WM) in chronic schizophrenia remains unclear.


PURPOSE
To investigate the WM functional alterations in chronic never-treated schizophrenia and the effects of long-term antipsychotic treatment.


STUDY TYPE
Prospective.


SUBJECTS
Twenty-five never-treated, 41 matched antipsychotic-treated schizophrenia, and 25 healthy comparison subjects.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
Resting state (rs)-fMRI, T1 -weighted images (T1 WI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) covering the whole brain were acquired with a 3.0T scanner.


ASSESSMENT
Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in WM and the correlation coefficients between WM and GM were examined and compared among the three participant groups by two reviewers independently. Independent component analysis (ICA) was added to evaluate WM-fMRI signals. Statistical Tests: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA); Pearson correlation analysis.


RESULTS
Never-treated patients demonstrated lower ALFF in splenium of corpus callosum (SCC) relative to treated patients and controls (P < 0.001, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected). While the extracted independent component also located in SCC and showed significantly decreased connectivity in never-treated patients when compared to controls (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected). The correlation coefficients of WM-GM displayed greater reductions in the genu of corpus callosum (GCC), pontine crossing tract (PC), bilateral cingulum (hippocampus) (CGH), and bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) in treated patients relative to controls (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected).


DATA CONCLUSION
These findings provide new insight into WM functional alterations over the long-term course of schizophrenia with and without the potential effects of antipsychotic medication. Functional change and abnormal connectivity in SCC were both found greater in untreated patients than treated patients relative to healthy controls, suggesting that long-term antipsychotic treatment may show some protective effects on WM functional organization.

Healthy, germ-free HLA-B27 transgenic (Tg) rats develop chronic colitis when colonized with complex gut commensal bacteria or Bacteroides vulgatus whereas non-transgenic (nTg) rats remain disease-free. However, the role of B. theta, a well-characterized anaerobic commensal bacterium, in causing disease in Tg rats is unknown. Moreover, while host immune responses to the gut microbiota have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about how microbes respond to host inflammation. Hypothesis: B. theta monoassociated Tg rats develop chronic, immune-mediated colitis that is associated with transcriptional responses in the bacteria that initiate and perpetuate disease. Methods: Four Tg and five nTg rats were monoassociated with a human isolate of B. theta (VPI-5482) for six weeks. Colonic inflammation was quantified by blinded histological scoring and real-time RT-PCR assays of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cecal bacterial concentrations were measured by quantitative plating on BHI agar. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of B. theta recovered from the cecum was performed using custom GeneChips and data analyzed using DChip, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. Results: B. theta monoassociated Tg rats had significantly more colonic inflammation and increased colonic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs than nTg controls (Table). Transcriptional profiles of cecal B. theta were significantly different in Tg vs. nTg rats (329 transcripts representing 44 KEGG canonical pathways). GSEA revealed that the GO molecular function of receptor activity, which is comprised mainly of genes that encode nutrient binding proteins, was significantly enriched with genes upregulated in B. theta from Tg rats [GSEA false discovery rate (FDR)=0.148]. KEGG canonical pathways of ribosome (FDR=0.048), oxidative phosphorylation (FDR=0.098), pyrimidine metabolism (FDR=0.081), purine metabolism (FDR=0.197), peptidoglycan biosynthesis (FDR=0.184), and metabolism (FDR=0.191) were significantly enriched with genes downregulated in B. theta from Tg rats. Numbers of viable bacteria/gram cecal contents in Tg vs. nTg rats were not significantly different. Conclusions: A well-characterized human isolate of B. theta induces mild colitis in HLA-B27 Tg rats and colitis is associated with changes in the expression of microbial metabolic and nutrient binding pathways, but no difference in concentrations of viable cecal bacteria. Mechanistic studies of differentially expressed B. theta genes may reveal novel pathways that initiate and/or perpetuate IBD.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Di Meng"", ids = ""49356098""); list(name = ""Weishu Zhu"", ids = ""7032518""); list(name = ""Nanda N.

f1f480016a50b9ce50cf1bf0891f347b7a5ad21f,Role of Melt Curve Analysis in Interpretation of Nutrigenomics' MicroRNA Expression Data.,"This article illustrates the importance of melt curve analysis (MCA) in interpretation of mild nutrogenomic micro(mi)RNA expression data, by measuring the magnitude of the expression of key miRNA molecules in stool of healthy human adults as molecular markers, following the intake of Pomegranate juice (PGJ), functional fermented sobya (FS), rich in potential probiotic lactobacilli, or their combination. Total small RNA was isolated from stool of 25 volunteers before and following a three-week dietary intervention trial. Expression of 88 miRNA genes was evaluated using Qiagen's 96 well plate RT2 miRNA qPCR arrays. Employing parallel coordinates plots, there was no observed significant separation for the gene expression (Cq) values, using Roche 480Â® PCR LightCycler instrument used in this study, and none of the miRNAs showed significant statistical expression after controlling for the false discovery rate. On the other hand, melting temperature profiles produced during PCR amplification run, found seven significant genes (miR-184, miR-203, miR-373, miR-124, miR-96, miR-373 and miR-301a), which separated candidate miRNAs that could function as novel molecular markers of relevance to oxidative stress and immunoglobulin function, for the intake of polyphenol (PP)-rich, functional fermented foods rich in lactobacilli (FS), or their combination. We elaborate on these data, and present a detailed review on use of melt curves for analyzing nutigenomic miRNA expression data, which initially appear to show no significant expressions, but are actually more subtle than this simplistic view, necessitating the understanding of the role of MCA for a comprehensive understanding of what the collective expression and MCA data collectively imply.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Farid E.

5a78c3fa8c26545261d8a2ae306af6d0e8c99e9d,Molars and incisors: show your microarray IDs,"BackgroundOne of the key questions in developmental biology is how, from a relatively small number of conserved signaling pathways, is it possible to generate organs displaying a wide range of shapes, tissue organization, and function. The dentition and its distinct specific tooth types represent a valuable system to address the issues of differential molecular signatures. To identify such signatures, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of developing murine lower incisors, mandibular molars and maxillary molars at the developmental cap stage (E14.5).Results231 genes were identified as being differentially expressed between mandibular incisors and molars, with a fold change higher than 2 and a false discovery rate lower than 0.1, whereas only 96 genes were discovered as being differentially expressed between mandibular and maxillary molars. Numerous genes belonging to specific signaling pathways (the Hedgehog, Notch, Wnt, FGF, TGFÎ²/BMP, and retinoic acid pathways), and/or to the homeobox gene superfamily, were also uncovered when a less stringent fold change threshold was used. Differential expressions for 10 out of 12 (mandibular incisors versus molars) and 9 out of 10 selected genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). A bioinformatics tool (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) used to analyze biological functions and pathways on the group of incisor versus molar differentially expressed genes revealed that 143 genes belonged to 9 networks with intermolecular connections. Networks with the highest significance scores were centered on the TNF/NFÎºB complex and the ERK1/2 kinases. Two networks ERK1/2 kinases and tretinoin were involved in differential molar morphogenesis.ConclusionThese data allowed us to build several regulatory networks that may distinguish incisor versus molar identity, and may be useful for further investigations of these tooth-specific ontogenetic programs. These programs may be dysregulated in transgenic animal models and related human diseases leading to dental anomalies.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Virginie Laugel-Haushalter"", ids = ""1403646904""); list(name = ""Marie Paschaki"", ids = ""6897335""); list(name = ""Christelle Thibault-Carpentier"", ids = ""1390173093""); list(name = ""Doulaye DembÃ©lÃ©"", ids = ""1726375""); list(name = ""Pascal DollÃ©"", ids = ""4541922""); list(name = ""AgnÃ¨s Bloch-Zupan"", ids = ""1398346196"")",d99ccdea6738c891df9d10fa3853e3ac4cc319aa; 9e4b51070cd7a12dcadfa30f7451b871ffbdec07; a4440ad4ca48d3890049e6bb1a60331167e320e1; 02c1790fe4776dfd1a3283b1cdb4b9297c7c0262; 3583c8901fa9b61551f7b1fb8ee8bbc270fa8ed3; beb9841e7994df6cb4e606e8bf3310527ffb0462; b7d26dde10505bd34cc2962b3d39dde338bc983a; c6e95f72a6a65c4407f86101238053023a8f5962; 12abf1672e9de4de9fce0a7032227a72ccc1b891; ebbb504e9dbc1deec6399304f60ed07f70f9d4a3; 286726edf2a41dc3ca98788fc750e554c37fa317; 9e956977e65d25fd5a50e8b51026ccfd683cf473; f591cd8402c6351a7185335c68f77d96dbcc15e2; 9c92874dfcf4f79faee05cf946e54acdc5a18d60; 33cb6afef8334be30197d6a69ae94ec3e4d52e44; 230f4575662a18ade0574b6a0e53197032ceefad; 96801893bcac537a53221b15a63383618ec0b0eb; 10e3624dfc8e7745a38fedddc792bb02c9a2aed7; 5a78c3fa8c26545261d8a2ae306af6d0e8c99e9d; cce871b1a2958757a0fa03aecc20135521eb7136,206f80a7d72aea517e2cb008673f2925cb534c16; 1e51e967699156198f84323170e465718deea68a; d9e87205cecc93a733ce90c44cc0d543ea3eb26a; bb61ce81407c70d3429c7c8a0b3f663fea9705c8; bbc4d21b8e8f29beb1ac1626602a9f40ba7649ab; a0cdafe8bb1696950feb8b45223e80ffa63a8d97; d8f6722899c96a3891911c56b3f2c7dae6fcd385; 07835000587d452d7995f6eb4fa082df5de589c1; 4d63912a0cb7eecef7d0ebda2c657f70044b384b; 5a78c3fa8c26545261d8a2ae306af6d0e8c99e9d; ca7356d9dded2325925879331ad19b90675a8957; 8d14c0572a0651d865a86010beb3f0c62dae5e2a; a66c1e236e1bd4662b69fa1ec5d61b4f535b90c7; b041af9d25de84f944c59bdcb7abe7bb78fbde07; e5750c993325e995b2d87f86fb963031f0dbd1f9; fcccb2548ca78ac68258a9235526061d7e505432; 98ce7686f2a614ad6028dcb293e017cdc9e4e4b9; cf4983bbce6a8c8a77230e8d16ddffad2d05b057; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 65f5f18d26181e31e5b4fdc69823732f1578a556; 29e74944731957e9baf2365e21cac5529ab4c69d; 5bfb7612bd2e434fc0170a165df36219795f1ba4; 32d7a09c409c0b226da8af2a0d9f98eba700fd93; cbdbdb365eca89e37d2244da867b9def84565415; a206ee0375f0d8496e31845e3bea2f1218bf256f; ce9fa3b7aef1dc04a4ba84132ac0a5e08654c514; 2d176bb9be678d14ce137484138de0187a304439; 21d8ee70239b9fd3ab7e801630302581952e21a4; 9847f48aeb7a791c21c81ae5f27b9e9033b7824f; 60d53e40b7e3362c2a296ff78e5c1698715acc6e; 868930e03475100dedb331ad9b8f10fd1e42de7f; 7bf48b78b767fe0caec1058137a867b84da109cc; 7e3f248738f8fca7c3dbf40746b722a2a51f4dbd; 70f8f7823c5e00782a1b0f36df30465fe5b5126d; c3355800b24b10bc7bf483d6d4c47d15dfcf4f65; e3ec8f5d06c02130dfc1130253008cf2b3cff0b5; b4ee33ae425adf2ba0279d72a19415d5e9d3eeda; 095155351815938ad37fe74221ccd300116129ed; 28fe073bf4d0fa769b2c5ab0e37dcd1dd6acf1c5; 162bb58f0abe79a36887323f7904f5b4e608f8c8; 15787b468d44fd5d7eba02bbc8cf7ea842f1a77d; 31c9f2a32560be6db2222ebf6cdfb02290c7a3c3; b1ad55f491cd8cdf4a4338e7169212db8bfc4c73; 601d4c1156be4d78f16078eaa83cc11caa6c913b; 9d687b67f1dd8d1ee469d048cf3de4caa138afe3; 49e1124d7c11ab36ce4c57fd08b795f74e58110a; 2f327865c6d89b81d0726624b1083377de665e2c; 6d9b4e194b37627842e91aa7601f05fb29ca9959; 73a1f7b9cc8910be190a533d6cc25985c284708d; 0695ee13cbd1dce341e773b2616b4c69c15755ca; 8d9d51fc8a0b37a65935c4da8296f9a2d50d2267; f05c63ea2ef897f3f42ed736df5eab7fc45ab679; 3c405cdfd9dea6aad0c65274d2a6175a7b6dde0b; 60afa82429b8330de06a6d2c18beff4b76bf232e; e19b221ff52f4976c9968b310115592e0641eb73; c36e6e0e689ce90cb0d1351baa4f18eb53183031; 763f726ec7f08b588d0ec21ffaeba09211b7652f; 1824da8f1a6c0366af7df5267c59bddd8f4ed0e6; 0e143dd3d800be801c06e8d5e5a84eb48ac6163a; 358eb7ad77bd2c09eca16b592ca44d37e2cc0cea; b3a30766417d6ce775b362a845d376979817dd70; 3239df61fc34b4fde69c5a22b95e22fa18621ace; 1c597d15126f47ecb832c7a38bb7bd4ca0345d79; a775ffb9c5b327254a37a786bb92fe0d408c002e; f1f4464b42ee8d4ebf37ac72e63e72aae28f3075; 69c7406cf9cf58370426f7ce5c37410ea59e043e; 3c897b0a7f47279ca0f45b694e2fa7d859cbc071; 75d655ede09522d6efa0af50181127ad271eb477; c2b6967bbbb8815a1fdf08bb87b8ac804c19d50b; a77053167ac0280b2f9aa6a7961f8cc58574964c; 8477c629e59fadd902bb194ad373a27a46fe6a80; b330ce98e3a43a935cf1380a16148e25b44f8cee; 93eaa920606580c4953e2e546d0d3b02256a6265; 6e1bbfa22f55dc197f2af5870d6ba292985ee42a; 0b2676c77e5433eb7b4688c7cad7f6e0844f91d9; db5a7c9e967b24841120151c257ac1b41e7cb768; 2ccb14b9675e93f03f3120bdc8d165a70b763f29; 0f178b18ca59470304ac58d660968104c223b9f1; f7a1f8ad17bf72609a7984ee8fbb1a404e7f2a95; d2075944fbb833d57173d528d5f44ecd27c2fe09; 0177a40bee204e1dd40547a9a0adfe9dca005379,BMC Research Notes,6,113 - 113
52d3f3490311ed466b2327ad26b88d847ffd485b,Beyond APOL 1 : Genetic Inroads into Understanding Population Disparities in Diabetic Kidney Disease,"A compelling genetic basis for the excess burden of nondiabetic kidney disease in blacks has been provided.APOL1 kidney risk variants account for approximately 70% of the African ancestry disparity in the progression of a rather wide spectrum of etiologies of nondiabetic CKD. The discovery was enabled by combining population genetics and evolutionary medicine approaches, which have been the subject of several recent reviews (1â€“3). The odds ratios (ORs) for increased risk of progressive kidney injury conferred by these variants (ranging from OR, 7 to OR, .80 depending on underlying etiology) compared with those previously described in other populationâ€“based disease risk association studies (typically ranging from OR, 1.1 to OR, 2.0) places the APOL1 kidney disease risk variants among the highest ever reported for a common variant associated with a common disease. Consistent highâ€“level APOL1 risk variant association has been conspicuously absent for diabetic kidney disease (1), save for some studies inwhich it was difficult to exclude nondiabetic etiologies among subjects with concomitant diabetes and kidney disease enrolled without pathologic validation of diabetic kidney disease (4,5). Therefore, the underpinnings of increased risk for diabetic kidney disease in blacks remain an enigmatic health disparitywith resolution that presents a challenging research imperative. Genomeâ€“wide association studies (GWASs) as well as candidate gene approaches to study diabetic nephropathy more generally have identified several genomic regions of possible interest (6). A relevant area of inquiry has included identification of possible genetic risk loci for albuminuria (7,8). Such loci should be mechanistically revealing to the understanding of CKD progression, because albuminuria reflects damage to glomerular macromolecular ultrafiltration and/or dysfunctional proximal tubule processing of albumin with consequent abnormalities in downstream vasoactive and fibrotic pathways (9) The reported heritability of albuminuria in the general population and in patients with diabetes ranges from 0.2 to 0.46 (8). Albuminuria is the most frequently assessed marker of kidney damage measured in clinical practice, and it has been associated in a meta-analyses of approximately 1.5 million individuals from multiple cohorts with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and ESRD (10,11). Boger et al. (7) reported the statistical association of a common cubilin (CUBN) missense variation (rs1801239; I2984V) with both an elevated urine albumin excretion ratio (P,0.001) and albuminuria (P50.001) in population sample sets including diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Although the CUBN variant association was statistically significant after appropriate false discovery rate corrections in this meta-analysis comprising 63,153 individuals of European ancestry and 6981 African ancestry individuals, the identified variants only accounted for a fraction of heritability. Tzur et al. (12) reported a unique extended haplotype structure at theCUBN locus and suggested that population ancestryâ€“based haplotype structure could be leveraged to identify causative variants predicting albuminuriaâ€“related diabetic kidney disease risks in African ancestry individuals. In this issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Ma et al. (13) took advantage of next generation exome sequencing at both the CUBN and the megalin (LRP2) â€“encoding gene loci. CUBN encodes a large 460-kD glycosylated extracellular protein that interacts with other membrane proteins involved in endocytosis. In the proximal tubule, CUBN interacts withmegalin, forming amultireceptor complex. Megalin is a 600-kD transmembrane protein initially identified as the autoantigen inHeymann nephritis, the classic historical experimental model for membranous nephropathy. Amnionless is responsible for trafficking of CUBN to the membrane. The multiligand endocytic receptor CUBN interacting with megalin has been identified as essential in the process of kidney proximal tubular uptake of filtered proteins (reviewed in ref. 14). Mendelian recessive loss of function mutations in either CUBN or AMN cause Megaloblastic Anemia 1 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 261100) combining proteinuria and B12 deficiency, whereas rare recessive loss of function mutations in LRP2 cause severe multisystem syndromes, which include proteinuria. Reabsorption at these sites is responsible for recovery of essential components but also, clears other biologically active substances from the ultrafiltrate so that more distal kidney tubular segments are not exposed to these substances. The relationship between genes with complete loss of function that results in such highâ€“penetrance rare Mendelian inheritance disorders and the association of common variants at these same loci with corresponding common disease phenotypes is never predictable but worthy of exploration. *Department of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine and Research Institute, Technion, Haifa, Israel Institute of Technology, Israel; Department of Nephrology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; and Division of Nephrology, Mayanei HaYeshua Medical Center, Bnei Brak, Israel",2016,,"list(name = ""Karl Skorecki"", ids = ""2136758""); list(name = ""Walter G Wasser"", ids = ""5585690"")",,e9d23a0a82f35739bacbd7d76fc2848ae135cdce; 41e05ca9c7a6df77d007c1f530a3a156df276a30; 588edda3197555029ae5ba04be90b12936ecf7fe; fdd167f2b597682f6c4237b3e560f1bdfccdcc18; 580af1031391f1864e8bb8d43156c8cf3918c7f1; 4f55cd3b00dd2059d3ab005922b610c4f89a64e9; 2521e37a57c2b19706a5eda91c56334c09f2c98d; d1c32e1508875dc0f68405005367a670dee22d06; 2eb06848c4200cfe15104d61695734dba3bbe64a; a36aac43e1900cc1c689ed27cb07046bd2ea9337; 5d98c1664bffd6c79d2b5e4480213e95b34fcdd9; 6c6e047cc3dd335aa781b9f22ffb4a8dbb5b2701; 0766af31fcb453d0aee9c27ab656e1d4f8d5dcb4; 3b8f5a4ad1915881230aad39204e5a0a5f2fae45; 5e3b70d596fcb9176e2e8a27edeb0987e4b8d1ad; cca390899e04b8a9b124c3e68c3b2af22cffb3f6; 5a1b8968d24452c51d3c651f6ff58b52cc342365; efd804b4f4338612ce5f5d8b344b85e0f950e920; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; 639abafa5633d1677899223f6ab7ce4266c01497; 5a202cb6e0f2c99c05af408858eb9806dc8dc945; 53b183beeac3d2d63c7f52de6c4b6fbe5a799e55; 1a7ea051d64ab036500376f59b1c0b5823486207; 2261d87eb900b31ec395f04a2acf333f3940b024,,,
0e9be5656212af5b449e4802d03a0ee97d197850,Integrated analysis of hepatic mRNA and miRNA profiles identified molecular networks and potential biomarkers of NAFLD,"To enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms and mine novel biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), RNA sequencing was performed to gain hepatic expression profiles of mRNAs and miRNAs in NAFLD and normal rats. Using DESeq with thresholds of a two-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05, 336 mRNAs and 21 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed. Among those, 17 miRNAs (e.g., miR-144-3p, miR-99a-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-200b-5p, miR-200c-3p, etc.) might serve as novel biomarkers of NAFLD. MiRNA target genes (13565) were predicted by the miRWalk database. Using DAVID 6.8, the intersection (195 genes) of differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNA-predicted target genes were enriched in 47 gene ontology (GO) terms and 28 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Using Cytoscape, pathway interaction and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and hub genes (e.g., Abcg8, Cyp1a1, Cyp51, Hmgcr, etc.) associated with NAFLD were obtained. Moreover, 673 miRNA-mRNA negative regulatory pairs were obtained, and networks were constructed. Finally, several representative miRNAs and mRNAs were validated by real-time qPCR. In conclusion, potential molecular mechanisms of NAFLD could be inferred from integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA profiles, which may indicate novel biomarkers of NAFLD.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mingzhe Zhu"", ids = ""46694875""); list(name = ""Qianlei Wang"", ids = ""1399966377""); list(name = ""Wenjun Zhou"", ids = ""46352086""); list(name = ""Tao Liu"", ids = ""144018875""); list(name = ""Lili Yang"", ids = ""14948219""); list(name = ""Peiyong Zheng"", ids = ""34128849""); list(name = ""Li Zhang"", ids = ""48570810""); list(name = ""Guang Ji"", ids = ""145758319"")",7a32e32f3557c6b25baf574e4dd6f55848c4a1eb; 73398916aec80ad518899eeb27003b99935bab35; 9ffbb274969bfe04e4164bb1974e3e1def5c588e; 50f3bb16b6f3f325145895ffa84e75f44f48f1fd; abffa53a92606e90c60fed22afeb2ced89249882; 7741121e16fa230c38b6f5b2c185be8c91f15aa0; 45c83bb158db8cea46d494989ddd9e807edb11f1; 48d125a23a5a9b0f022804b6540902abe9a8d314,7b21852650a8fc323664964107b5502ef323c79c; a896c798447e9cc23b2c96d8c69f34135bcc19d7; 6d032dfcc9185af2fb3da0105b316ab13f393764; dd36014d0cf06a697e343388cf51373d4456305b; 4a445c0776c3575fa9ea40631d5c29f91c1c5998; 153e25f20e9c3248e084a61b47072419472ff686; 75b51dae6bc14f72befbcfeda1f9759b77f7dc13; a78370ed3543f6e63513cda43ead0b554efb8f20; 06158cfc6b0e3e1b1ca8d013171ad2a460a7dd50; 0849b621e7e82a96ef73a8fbf25e2c79d07c1e0c; d71598acd7bc03fe54cb07095ef086716528cfe5; 30e5e0f23bf88c61922714ae9f6c5e636749ba6f; 711f2e6a5ce22ba673a720e0b9107655fba5d09b; 72677ba96aeace46d0d3a66a70eea00ca1003dcc; 2d9ed229685bf44435aa214b92215858e0e90b5f; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 790fca4c5f73f601ccf888a78ef3b23a51b97239; 1ce0658aedf0da568ad0241445dccba6fcec3b30; 606d1979594c17c27f87bb87152b47725d96e1b6; b77189499ca73140cfb510e693e5b5efbb68569c; 3a2e0df05125a10b926eb0ba498b1c784282d2c5; 7e6ff99d51478c8e0fcddf22c0eb979030dce61c; 6af0e41df3f9808a944a9f09c55bca2018606176; 443766e018e968c6279cf1c58f22eddeb72bd607; 28dd5511d704067af5d58f0789b12a7dce4d300e; d446bbfd021a8131a4097bb9b5692b1c16771aa5; 4fc5a83064bf2ec553411bb4046a724d990bde84; 6aa46af7795ac563a9c11ca033c8b98535696625; ea29218a85901fb794922d2a889ed7bf34125b11; 66cda0a0179565e19b60bd0a15748b2bf38bd59d; 1bf2db17b8218e72a2c7a41c4f0b6f65abc2ab95; 96229629ef47e353a983a8f8a3e0cf7e34b3879c; 428bb7461b65f5aca0679e6b13fab3be2c8ce7cf; 3c498581f7506aefbf9d365a2ff201d29342ae9c; 7d79ec4324b08b972bc0d8bdb279e286cc1c0cba; e99c78712eef990895979ecbe6a8b70132e51853; f4c7a3ce4a4681703694ab4e895ed5b4f9edf36f; 0867949b5fbdad62303e734294cf533eb8ad3141; b180debeb90b505d1d2639892a371821b2e2fa04; 71e130fd6a09b353ff90afc0f455708e0a48abe1; bfb9c26fa776a96609ee293a1a97c3b91b9e14d4; 9e12876fda70788d2cf21d8742b3dbb8fbb2bd78; c4cfced3088ab145e91edd234f311668d4ec066f; cfbd1a212ffc1e2e4d4bfd96b2a5d61e28bdd72b; a83cfd2160623f3e0ec2d432a3cfd5e7c3459b8c; 141c45b7731014eb0f876edb17a02c0ac96daff6; fa7bb30808415e0ab7ae6d95cce92f1c7e7a0e15; aba35f3cfa50dc639909dc63e8d3ef78db7b0a6a,Scientific Reports,8,
90f47769e3c2dc095b84d6585cd285733af3c541,ICAR 2011: Abstracts,"Background: CXCR4 phenotype has been associated with increased severity of HIV disease, higher viral load, and decreased CD4 T-cell counts. We thus evaluated whether a genotypic analysis of coreceptor tropism impacts on HIV-related markers such as CD4-cell counts. Methods: 960 HIV-1 B subtype infected patients (all maravirocnaive) with an available V3 sequence were analyzed. Tropism determination was performed by using Geno2Pheno algorithm. All V3 mutations, including the mutations used for tropism prediction (Sing T et al., Antiviral Therapy 2007), with prevalence [1% were considered. The associations of CD4 cell counts with false positive rate (FPR) ranges and V3 mutations were evaluated by Mannâ€“ Whitney test, Chi-squared test for trend and Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg method was used to identify results that were statistically significant in the presence of multiplehypothesis testing. A false discovery rate of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Results: Overall, 26% of patients (either drug-naive or drug-experienced) were infected by X4 tropic viruses (using the classical 10% FPR cutoff). Among patients with available CD4 cell-counts at V3 genotypic test, 321 were drug-naive and 490 drug-experienced (median [IQR] CD4-cell counts: 331 [201â€“448] vs. 282 [138â€“422] cells/mm, p = 0.004). CD4 cell-count \200 cells/mm was observed in 80 drug-naive patients and in 169 drug-experienced patients. For different CD4 cell count ranges, FPR\2% was mostly associated, in experienced patients, with CD4 cell-counts \200 cells/mm (\200 vs. 200â€“350 vs. 350â€“500 vs. [500 cells/ mm: 21.3 vs. 7.6 vs. 9.0 vs. 8.0%, respectively, p = 0.0005). This finding was also observed in drug-naive patients, even if with less significance (11.3 vs. 6 vs. 2.6 vs. 1.5%, respectively, p = 0.040). A deeper analysis showed that patients with FPR \2% (both naive and drug-experienced) carried a significantly greater risk of having CD4 counts \200 cells/mm (see figure). Among all V3 mutations analyzed (87 in naive patients and 88 in experienced patients), in drug-experienced patients the X4-related S11R was the only mutation found associated with CD4 cell count \200 cells/mm (17.8 vs. 5.6% in \200 vs. [200 CD4, respectively, p \ 0.001). This significance was confirmed after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Within the context of genotypically-defined CXCR4 tropism, FPR \2% and the X4-related mutation S11R are associated with low CD4 rank, and thus may be related with a greater risk of disease progression. These findings suggest that FPR, beyond tropism prediction, can be used also as a marker to evaluate the immunological status of HIV-1 infected patients.

These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways.

b061687c2437b8b3228b7a92a9e4f257c1d71eeb,Genetic variants in circTUBB interacting with smoking can enhance colorectal cancer risk,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an intriguing class of regulatory RNAs involved in the tumorigenesis of many cancers, including colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, circRNAs sponge microRNAs (miRNAs) with specific miRNA response elements (MREs) and compete for regulatory target genes downstream. However, the genetic effects of MREs on colorectal cancer susceptibility remain unclear. The MREs of colorectal cancer-associated circRNAs (CRC-circRNAs) and corresponding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by the transcriptome of cancer cells and the 1000 Genomes Project. The association between candidate SNPs and colorectal cancer risk was evaluated in a Chinese population (1150 cases and 1342 controls) and two European populations (9023 cases and 386,896 controls) using logistic regression analysis. Among the 197 candidate SNPs within MREs of 186 CRC-circRNAs, rs25497 in circTUBB was significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk in a Chinese population after false discovery rate (FDR) correction [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.44â€“2.21, Pâ€‰=â€‰1.42â€‰Ã—â€‰10â€“7, PFDRâ€‰=â€‰2.80â€‰Ã—â€‰10â€“5] and even reached significance in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) under the dominant model (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.28â€‰Ã—â€‰10â€“8). Similar results were found in the European populations (ORmeta = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.10â€“1.53). Both stratification and interaction analyses revealed that rs25497 interacting with smoking affected the colorectal cancer risk (Pinteractionâ€‰=â€‰1.48â€‰Ã—â€‰10â€“2). Here, we first comprehensively identified genetic variants in MREs of CRC-circRNAs and evaluated their effects on colorectal cancer risk in both Chinese and European populations. These findings provide basis for a comprehensive understanding of colorectal cancer etiology.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ke Zhang"", ids = ""49481130""); list(name = ""Shuwei Li"", ids = ""47319239""); list(name = ""Dongying Gu"", ids = ""5413219""); list(name = ""Kaili Xu"", ids = ""46321209""); list(name = ""Rongkun Zheng"", ids = ""145462240""); list(name = ""Junyi Xin"", ids = ""11527764""); list(name = ""Yixuan Meng"", ids = ""2167592""); list(name = ""Shuai Ben"", ids = ""4140059""); list(name = ""Haiyan Chu"", ids = ""2063143""); list(name = ""Zhengdong Zhang"", ids = ""48805432""); list(name = ""Yongqian Shu"", ids = ""2564373""); list(name = ""Mulong Du"", ids = ""145048803""); list(name = ""Lingxiang Liu"", ids = ""2267984""); list(name = ""Meilin Wang"", ids = ""38673410"")",,d93c1bda082e5c203f686fa2fc910a8bcd73a739; 29a2accaf0b72362eb148721fa4bc75cf5355688; eb831ad42c4a4b31ce82bc8bd912a1a67f7b95cb; b447a0e117937a4043d4ddaa465e2cd2f22300dc; 3a6a1300d6c664422ceed16be7b2c9450158643c; 04d851bd56e5541b63b5c7d8a15d75cc887cbf32; ab64130998f2b81d1fa358ef857fe9d39adb3ea5; 9d43bb18d04179637ff8927df44d7c8bc1ec0d40; 8701435bc82840cc5f040871e3690964998e6fd3; 4ac24482fee0652d3d83ca8a30477004a3d180df; 1ab29174a171d2cf6b4a572f7a0b93455ae24223; 7fbb5347aa4002f6e82a43046aba3230671f01b9; 7e6911294c95c02383d449f0b966d4c253fca46a; ef5cb07296bcdde80d657ddeac28b46f5e91b8e5; 48f2c8ab1a9498f75347ac864392cdd5068e993f; 4b735004d9d00882c994a4e0025e547489f2ee1c; f5655ba1db27f01a17bbfeb4eff18f248d8c6775; 61b13b1324e1f7bdf5832b0402f6e86f5495f5f8; 0e8dbcd06de214bcbe9400253f95a81823ce721a; da18860c07f307b67d2a92efa45fba7c6ed6af67; 4144262404079fc4044aad441e4efa2ea6a95c04; 83ab5cf89399bca5449f4a7baf1b1b3c2e1178c7; b1d65f091f037ac41d205cd88cf897e547a7203b; 0cb068476c8a12de98a12fea354d0c986e175057; 510e4364dcb20599a157090cc03229596a50c65b; a9cc79a5df0f7802145401b464e4bb30c23b8efa; 2e7a48c201222712d703d18412f34de5d41db2a0; 4ab25142f68faa57015456a577bbc6b6aaee2eb8; 4b0d73b6dd43e9834d3a7dcd41acffac00bead80; fafbcf2d581b4f1e76b50b774c5b214cacd5c077,Archives of Toxicology,94,325 - 333

Involvement of both donor and recipient characteristics need to be considered to understand the mechanisms underlying early response to I/R injury. We thereby did an early longitudinal molecular analysis of pre-implant (K1) and post-reperfusion (K2) renal allograft biopsies and used novel techniques to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the I/R injury and recovery in this complex setting of transplantation. Methods A total of 146 early longitudinal biopsies collected from 73 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) were used in this study. Gene expression (Affymetrix HG-U133Av2 Gene Chips) arrays were performed on all allograft biopsies. Gene expression analysis was done using expression and transcriptome console softwares. The similarity matrices between the paired repeat measure arrays, ie at the two different time points, were measured. Probe sets were considered significant when the false discovery rate (FDR) was < 5 % and fold change greater than 1.5. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was done on all samples. Significantly differentially expressed probe sets were analyzed using IPA software. Results PCA of gene expression data from pre-implant biopsies showed 2 separate clusters (grp I; grp II). Two clusters were seen upon analyzing post-reperfusion biopsies as well. However, upon combining the longitudinal repeat measures from each sample, and studying the similarity matrices, 3 distinct groups were observed. The third cluster (grp IIb) consisted of samples that grouped with grp I at pre-implant stage and shifted to grp II at post-reperfusion stage. These biopsies had the maximum differentially expressed genes between K1 and K2 biopsies. Groups II and IIb were the high risk groups for DGF and also lower recovery at one month post-transplantation. A detailed analysis of the pathways involved in I/R injury in each of these groups showed clear differences in metabolic and inflammatory pathways. The high risk groups either had exacerbated inflammatory response involving cytokines like TNF-&agr;, LIF and other inflammatory molecules like C5AR1 (Grp II), or showed inhibition of majority of the inflammatory pathways like inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, eNOS signaling with down regulation of genes like CD40, MHC II, CD1 (Grp IIb). Conclusion The analysis shows that balanced gene expression and regulation are key factors for immediate functioning and recovery of the kidney post I/R injury. The markers from each of these groups together with clinical data can determine efficiently high risk group for DGF and worse short term outcomes. Further analysis will help delineate necessary therapeutic intervention for recovery of kidney function post I/R injury after renal transplantation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sai Vineela Bontha"", ids = ""4902633""); list(name = ""Angela C Fernandez"", ids = ""77186892""); list(name = ""Daniel G.

995d8a1e9d28e4388620fbad2635bd063381d413,On â€œField Significanceâ€ and the False Discovery Rate,"The conventional approach to evaluating the joint statistical significance of multiple hypothesis tests (i.e., â€œfield,â€ or â€œglobal,â€ significance) in meteorology and climatology is to count the number of individual (or â€œlocalâ€) tests yielding nominally significant results and then to judge the unusualness of this integer value in the context of the distribution of such counts that would occur if all local null hypotheses were true. The sensitivity (i.e., statistical power) of this approach is potentially compromised both by the discrete nature of the test statistic and by the fact that the approach ignores the confidence with which locally significant tests reject their null hypotheses. An alternative global test statistic that has neither of these problems is the minimum p value among all of the local tests. Evaluation of field significance using the minimum local p value as the global test statistic, which is also known as the Walker test, has strong connections to the joint evaluation of multiple tests in a way that controls the â€œfalse discovery rateâ€ (FDR, or the expected fraction of local null hypothesis rejections that are incorrect). In particular, using the minimum local p value to evaluate field significance at a level global is nearly equivalent to the slightly more powerful global test based on the FDR criterion. An additional advantage shared by Walkerâ€™s test and the FDR approach is that both are robust to spatial dependence within the field of tests. The FDR method not only provides a more broadly applicable and generally more powerful field significance test than the conventional counting procedure but also allows better identification of locations with significant differences, because fewer than global 100% (on average) of apparently significant local tests will have resulted from local null hypotheses that are true.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Daniel S.

7be7e0250bfa5430dcf66045d6e4d1415be697c9,Protein-network modeling of prostate cancer gene signatures reveals essential pathways in disease recurrence,"OBJECTIVE
Uncovering the dominant molecular deregulation among the multitude of pathways implicated in aggressive prostate cancer is essential to intelligently developing targeted therapies. Paradoxically, published prostate cancer gene expression signatures of poor prognosis share little overlap and thus do not reveal shared mechanisms. The authors hypothesize that, by analyzing gene signatures with quantitative models of protein-protein interactions, key pathways will be elucidated and shown to be shared.


DESIGN
The authors statistically prioritized common interactors between established cancer genes and genes from each prostate cancer signature of poor prognosis independently via a previously validated single protein analysis of network (SPAN) methodology. Additionally, they computationally identified pathways among the aggregated interactors across signatures and validated them using a similarity metric and patient survival.


MEASUREMENT
Using an information-theoretic metric, the authors assessed the mechanistic similarity of the interactor signature. Its prognostic ability was assessed in an independent cohort of 198 patients with high-Gleason prostate cancer using Kaplan-Meier analysis.


RESULTS
Of the 13 prostate cancer signatures that were evaluated, eight interacted significantly with established cancer genes (false discovery rate <5%) and generated a 42-gene interactor signature that showed the highest mechanistic similarity (p<0.0001). Via parameter-free unsupervised classification, the interactor signature dichotomized the independent prostate cancer cohort with a significant survival difference (p=0.009). Interpretation of the network not only recapitulated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/NF-ÎºB signaling, but also highlighted less well established relevant pathways such as the Janus kinase 2 cascade.


CONCLUSIONS

3d117cd13f7fdb3a951210c20c50388ecbf9432f,Comparison of the Empirical Bayes and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays,"Microarrays enable to measure the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. One important statistical question in such experiments is which of the several thousand genes are differentially expressed. Answering this question requires methods that can deal with multiple testing problems. One such approach is the control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Two recently developed methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes and the estimation of the FDR are the SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) procedure and an empirical Bayes approach. In the two group case, both methods are based on a modified version of the standard t-statistic. However, it is also possible to use the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic. While there already exists a version of the empirical Bayes approach based on this rank statistic, we introduce in this paper a new version of SAM based on Wilcoxon rank sums. We furthermore compare these four procedures by applying them to simulated and real gene expression data.",2003,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Holger Schwender"", ids = ""2664121""); list(name = ""Andreas Krause"", ids = ""77619309""); list(name = ""Katja Ickstadt"", ids = ""2079028"")",4438dcc869dbd2b77d20eb6b21a94509233613f9; 3942ad8bf5542a7ecd9d3a4852f7c73936a9e121; c737dd5490ba837af892ea7fca94aa26b174cabb; 8b493c0c3b92690c0f9c13bd2297e9f2aeff983c; 83952c3ae5d13b31bae6cdd08b9b9bacaf1093bb; 7537c8fa0d771824a314a72615207527c9a48feb; 64e0f6ee642ddd807e1cf8a32c6dce91b9d60332; ffd3e521b609b7061942d70cf50f4e322896c67e; 38ba816182212d374f724a12d8213c7a855dd260; 60e7a083b8e68d97de733b7b7d4d30261890a249; 160d219dd9bdbfd223763a837cf869e86182d16d,e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; d3001913e21d745ea6a430077869bb290ad86cc6; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; c413dcf29a2bee0118497b0dbea99b863e9eca23; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; f628674ca6108606f9fc50a187510d92be334273,Technical reports,,
9014843b3c35914728746fbd2704bafba3a39f31,BAL Cell Gene Expression Is Indicative of Outcome and Airway Basal Cell Involvement in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease with a variable and unpredictable course. Objectives: To determine whether BAL cell gene expression is predictive of survival in IPF. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the BAL transcriptome of three independent IPF cohorts: Freiburg (Germany), Siena (Italy), and Leuven (Belgium) including 212 patients. BAL cells from 20 healthy volunteers, 26 patients with sarcoidosis stage III and IV, and 29 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were used as control subjects. Survival analysis was performed by Cox models and componentâ€wise boosting. Presence of airway basal cells was tested by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,582 genes were predictive of mortality in the IPF derivation cohort in univariate analyses adjusted for age and sex at false discovery rate less than 0.05. A nineâ€gene signature, derived from the discovery cohort (Freiburg), performed well in both replication cohorts, Siena (P < 0.0032) and Leuven (P = 0.0033). nCounter expression analysis confirmed the array results (P < 0.0001). The genes associated with mortality in BAL cells were significantly enriched for genes expressed in airway basal cells. Further analyses by gene expression, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry showed an increase in airway basal cells in BAL and tissues of IPF compared with control subjects, but not in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sarcoidosis. Conclusions: Our results identify and validate a BAL signature that predicts mortality in IPF and improves the accuracy of outcome prediction based on clinical parameters. The BAL signature associated with mortality unmasks a potential role for airway basal cells in IPF.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Antje Prasse"", ids = ""2996391""); list(name = ""Harald Binder"", ids = ""38156792""); list(name = ""Jonas Christian Schupp"", ids = ""37970647""); list(name = ""Gian Kayser"", ids = ""144240255""); list(name = ""Elena Bargagli"", ids = ""1887402""); list(name = ""Benedikt Jaeger"", ids = ""47867956""); list(name = ""Moritz Hess"", ids = ""39893178""); list(name = ""Susanne Rittinghausen"", ids = ""115830235""); list(name = ""Louis J.

601d13827ff98e6200cf46220cf4679e176c21e2,Impact of visceral fat on gene expression profile in peripheral blood cells in obese Japanese subjects,"BackgroundVisceral fat plays a central role in the development of metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The association of visceral fat accumulation with cardio-metabolic diseases has been reported, but the impact of visceral fat on the gene expression profile in peripheral blood cells remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) on the gene expression profile in peripheral blood cells of obese subjects.MethodsAll 17 enrolled subjects were hospitalized to receive diet therapy for obesity (defined as body mass index, BMI, greater than 25Â kg/m2). VFA and SFA were measured at the umbilical level by computed tomography (CT). Blood samples were subjected to gene expression profile analysis by using SurePrint G3 Human GE Microarray 8Â Ã—Â 60Â k ver. 2.0. The correlation between various clinical parameters, including VFA and SFA, and peripheral blood gene expression levels was analyzed.ResultsAmong the 17 subjects, 12 had normal glucose tolerance or borderline diabetes, and 5 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes without medications [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); 6.3Â Â±Â 1.3%]. The mean BMI, VFA, and SFA were 30.0Â Â±Â 5.5Â kg/m2, 177Â Â±Â 67 and 245Â Â±Â 131Â cm2, respectively. Interestingly, VFA altered the expression of 1354 genes, including up-regulation of 307 and down-regulation of 1047, under the statistical environment that the parametric false discovery rate (FDR) was less than 0.1. However, no significant effects were noted for SFA or BMI. Gene ontology analysis showed higher prevalence of VFA-associated genes than that of SFA-associated genes, among the genes associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, immune response, lipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism.ConclusionsAccumulation of visceral fat, but not subcutaneous fat, has a significant impact on the gene expression profile in peripheral blood cells in obese Japanese subjects.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshinari Obata"", ids = ""3936441""); list(name = ""Norikazu Maeda"", ids = ""34747614""); list(name = ""Yuya Yamada"", ids = ""50517175""); list(name = ""Koji Yamamoto"", ids = ""145524496""); list(name = ""Seiji Nakamura"", ids = ""48557928""); list(name = ""Masaya Yamaoka"", ids = ""31499314""); list(name = ""Yoshimitsu Tanaka"", ids = ""7561207""); list(name = ""Shigeki Masuda"", ids = ""6107040""); list(name = ""Hirofumi Nagao"", ids = ""46839928""); list(name = ""Shiro Fukuda"", ids = ""49023595""); list(name = ""Yuya Fujishima"", ids = ""37620321""); list(name = ""Shunbun Kita"", ids = ""48783689""); list(name = ""Hitoshi Nishizawa"", ids = ""10677481""); list(name = ""Tohru Funahashi"", ids = ""83203535""); list(name = ""Ken-ichi Matsubara"", ids = ""1882516""); list(name = ""Yuji Matsuzawa"", ids = ""2519591""); list(name = ""Iichiro Shimomura"", ids = ""5872667"")",20d32a21c7b29ae4ccb9a36966d33d1ce81b55b0; 79171a14c1b536bcb96c0090be7d42f784817f17; 70ea452d89759d64d3349fc69a5865e45ced91e3; c290f1c52a64e1166c02a97c4ee6591e670de5d7,aa03c4894c66f427c7c9990223445efe1949d3cf; 6f4cdfa6fdde0ecba49fcc1cf580c76de0c3c6db; dad77f2c96578827d1a3a366fb7878773e152885; 0f0c5b1d3bec9373804c64ff6080dbd8bd981a71; eebbbec08d52b0f36ac184641a281d2dcd0c7581; e17e6ba7c4d43b3a1e4f4f91190ae973d4b41ca6; 0580a9f076c2f0ccadc37db5f36970c42bebe9cc; 2ee0ccd1ecd3550fe0e9999c29f89f3c4a4453f4; 78a4eff40d42e29c2a157a48b35620dcfd5625ae; a12e6e6958604df3b6cc44030869bf04bb42ed62; 395e677b92511e76ba4505d2d05d8707b10841bc; 9a11a23f3afe42479a17a52d330c40bd000ea382; 2c990bed6328e5ee479e80fbd65d055a43cd8bcb; e45f5f189165e728db2e8af1f390d3c7a6db6cbc; 886bb6c086c4b9ba77626041756c37098734ad17; 3598b7ddfbf1d04879f6231cb1ea3d4cebc4c317; 6c707e0e2ba90f63a3192fc064d457f928b0ea0d; 02a39526b89d6e1658b9f00bc645c0cc5569fd35; 2b709117a6df57d16f49628622b4b9946bd25aee; 90b21b6ed47401bbc7d75028e9584bb420dcc8ea; 8f553b4155ec9a420334598b4b6d0cdc87d5c8c6; 7896eee0faed0d27f65ab9ce38b9401145c72c80; 19a68b23ff2165ea3c43fba9f6163d06469f628e; 068f1a8396cb149517dbddfcb8da37dc4bdb64b4; 2237aed0a76db3602251e4cd20998731cef3601d; ecd5dc918a2b1dc976a30297fb244876f87f070d,Cardiovascular Diabetology,15,
d62a29a6adad1d7945303c651d8147e2166cf135,The Effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome on the Dentate Gyrus and Learning and Memory in Children.,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with intermittent hypoxia and sleep loss. In children, impairments of cognitive function are important manifestations, but the underlying pathology is unknown. We hypothesized that OSAS would affect the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal subdivision essential to neurogenesis and cognition, and that this impact would further affect cognitive function in children. In children with OSAS (n = 11) and control subjects (n = 12; age and sex matched), we performed diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI, polysomnography, and neuropsychological assessments. We found that OSAS was associated with decreased mean diffusivity of the left dentate gyrus (p = 0.002; false discovery rate corrected; adjusting for sex, age, and body mass index), showing a large effect size (partial Î·2 = 0.491), but not with any other structural measures across the brain. Decreased dentate gyrus mean diffusivity correlated with a higher apnea hypopnea index (Spearman's r = -0.50, p = 0.008) and a greater arousal index (r = -0.44, p = 0.017). OSAS did not significantly affect neuropsychological measures (p values >0.5); however, a lower verbal learning score correlated with lower dentate gyrus mean diffusivity (r = 0.54, p = 0.004). Path analysis demonstrated that dentate gyrus mean diffusivity mediates the impact of OSAS on verbal learning capacity. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy of a regression model based on dentate gyrus mean diffusivity reached 85.8% (cross validated). This study demonstrates a likely pathway of effects of OSAS on neurocognitive function in children, as well as potential utility of the dentate gyrus mean diffusivity as an early marker of brain pathology in children with OSAS.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this study we investigate the relationships between dentate gyrus structure, hippocampus-dependent cognition, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We demonstrate lower mean diffusivity of the dentate gyrus in children with OSAS, which correlates with a lower verbal learning and memory score. This study provides new evidence of disrupted microstructure of the dentate gyrus in children with OSAS that may help explain some of the neurocognitive deficits described in these children.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiook Cha"", ids = ""40209044""); list(name = ""Johanna A Zea-Hernandez"", ids = ""1421874065""); list(name = ""Sanghun Sin"", ids = ""38122881""); list(name = ""Katharina D.

ac19ee7cb67e1edc2291103a852328c674e04fca,Model-based Spectral Library Approach for Bacterial Identification via Membrane Glycolipids.,"By circumventing the need for a pure colony, MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry of bacterial membrane glycolipids (lipid A) has the potential to identify microbes more rapidly than protein-based methods. However, currently available bioinformatics algorithms (e.g. dot products) do not work well with glycolipid mass spectra like those produced by lipid A, the membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharide. To address this issue, we propose a spectral library approach coupled with a machine learning technique to more accurately identify microbes. Here, we demonstrate the performance of the model-based spectral library approach for microbial identification using approximately a thousand mass spectra collected from multidrug-resistant bacteria. At false discovery rates < 1%, our approach identified many more bacterial species than the existing approaches such as the Bruker Biotyper and characterized over 97% of their phenotypes accurately. As the diversity in our glycolipid mass spectral library increases, we anticipate that it will provide valuable information to more rapidly treat infected patients.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""So Young Ryu"", ids = ""2248933""); list(name = ""George A.

To identify commonalities in gene expression data across all antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) tissues thus far characterized.


METHODS
Gene expression data were collected from the 3 AAV tissues thus far characterized (orbit, peripheral leukocytes, and sinus brushings). These data were analyzed to identify commonly expressed genes and disease pathways. The pathways data were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a combined local false discovery rate, which estimates the probability of a false discovery of a given pathway in all 3 tissues analyzed.


RESULTS
Only 4 genes were upregulated in all 3 tissues - IL1RN, TLR2, SLC11A1, and MMP9. After multiple comparison adjustments, the network pathway analysis revealed 28 pathways associated with all 3 tissues. The most strongly associated pathway for all 3 tissues was the neutrophil degranulation pathway [multidimensional local false discovery (md-locfdr) = 1.05 Ã— 10-12], followed by the osteoclast differentiation (md-locfdr = 3.8 Ã— 10-05), cell surface interactions at the vascular wall (md-locfdr = 4.2 Ã— 10-04), signaling by interleukins (md-locfdr = 6.1 Ã— 10-04), and phagosome (md-locfdr = 0.003) pathways. There were no downregulated genes or pathways common to all 3 tissues.


CONCLUSION
This analysis identified individual genes and pathways of disease common to all AAV tissues thus far characterized. The use of a network pathway analysis allowed us to identify pathologic mechanisms that were not readily apparent in the commonly expressed genes alone. Many of these pathways are consistent with current theories about infectious drivers and the crossroads of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. In addition, this analysis highlights novel pathways, such as vessel wall interactions and platelet activation, which require further investigation.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marcia A Friedman"", ids = ""11600017""); list(name = ""Dongseok Choi"", ids = ""144781917""); list(name = ""Stephen R Planck"", ids = ""6694309""); list(name = ""James T.

91a4d11e15f0bc52feabe56355b3d7f16c1558c8,"Trio, a novel high fecundity allele: I. Transcriptome analysis of granulosa cells from carriers and noncarriers of a major gene for bovine ovulation rateâ€ ","Abstract A major gene for bovine ovulation rate has been mapped to a 1.2 Mb region of chromosome 10. Screening of coding regions of positional candidate genes within this region failed to reveal a causative polymorphism, leading to the hypothesis that the phenotype results from differences in candidate gene expression rather than alteration of gene structure. This study tested differences in expression of positional candidate genes in granulosa cells between carriers and noncarriers of the high fecundity allele, as well as characterizing differences in the transcriptomic profile between genotypes. Five carriers and five noncarriers, female descendants of â€œTrio,â€ a carrier of the high fecundity allele were initially used in an RNA-seq analysis of gene expression. Four of ten samples were contaminated with theca cells, so that six samples were used in the final analysis (three of each genotype). Of 14 973 genes expressed, 143 were differentially expressed (false discovery rate P < 0.05) in carriers versus noncarriers. Among the positional candidate genes, SMAD6 was 6.6-fold overexpressed in the carriers compared to noncarriers (P < 5 Ã— 10-5). This result was replicated in an independent group of 12 females (7 carriers and 5 noncarriers) using quantitative real-time PCR; SMAD6 was 9.3-fold overexpressed in carriers versus noncarriers (P = 1.17 Ã— 10-6). Association of overexpression of SMAD6, an inhibitor of the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway, with high ovulation rate corresponds well with disabling mutations in ligands (BMP15 and GDF9) and a receptor (BMPR1B) of this pathway that cause increased ovulation rate in sheep. Summary Sentence Carriers of an allele for high ovulation rate exhibit a six-fold overexpression of the positional candidate gene SMAD6 compared to noncarriers, strongly implicating SMAD6 as the gene responsible for the high ovulation rate phenotype.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mamat H.

7bfc42dc290b19667b477e9b493726bde9800587,"Genes influencing spinal bone mineral density in inbred F344, LEW, COP, and DA rats","Previously, we identified the regions of chromosomes 10q12â€“q31 and 15p16â€“q21 harbor quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for lumbar volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) in female F2 rats derived from Fischer 344 (F344) Ã— Lewis (LEW) and Copenhagen 2331 (COP) Ã— Dark Agouti (DA) crosses. The purpose of this study is to identify the candidate genes within these QTL regions contributing to the variation in lumbar vBMD. RNA was extracted from bone tissue of F344, LEW, COP, and DA rats. Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays. Genes differentially expressed among the rat strains were then ranked based on the strength of the correlation with lumbar vBMD in F2 animals derived from these rats. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed to confirm the prioritized candidate genes. A total of 285 genes were differentially expressed among all strains of rats with a false discovery rate less than 10%.

Its mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. In this study, individual data from four independent microarray studies comparing the transcriptome of fibroblasts cultured in vitro from normal (total n = 20) and IPF (total n = 20) human lung were compiled for meta-analysis following normalization to z-scores. One hundred and thirteen transcripts were upregulated and 115 were downregulated in IPF fibroblasts using the Significance Analysis of Microrrays algorithm with a false discovery rate of 5%. Downregulated genes were highly enriched for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional classes related to inflammation and immunity such as Defense response to virus, Influenza A, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediated signaling pathway, interferon-inducible absent in melanoma2 (AIM2) inflammasome as well as Apoptosis. Although upregulated genes were not enriched for any functional class, select factors known to play key roles in lung fibrogenesis were overexpressed in IPF fibroblasts, most notably connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and serum response factor (SRF), supporting their role as drivers of IPF.

Yet, the selection of a threshold parameter $\lambda$ remains crucial in practice. To that aim we propose Quantile Universal Thresholding, a selection of $\lambda$ at the detection edge.

9f062969480863d8c1addf7c03b70fe71efbd231,Systematic evaluation of environmental factors: persistent pollutants and nutrients correlated with serum lipid levels,"BACKGROUND
Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Although genome-wide association studies are currently testing the genetic factors systematically, testing and reporting one or a few factors at a time can lead to fragmented literature for environmental chemical factors. We screened for correlation between environmental factors and lipid levels, utilizing four independent surveys with information on 188 environmental factors from the Centers of Disease Control, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, collected between 1999 and 2006.


METHODS
We used linear regression to correlate each environmental chemical factor to triglycerides, LDL-C and HDL-C adjusting for age, age(2), sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and body mass index. Final estimates were adjusted for waist circumference, diabetes status, blood pressure and survey. Multiple comparisons were controlled for by estimating the false discovery rate and significant findings were tentatively validated in an independent survey.


RESULTS
We identified and validated 29, 9 and 17 environmental factors correlated with triglycerides, LDL-C and HDL-C levels, respectively. Findings include hydrocarbons and nicotine associated with lower HDL-C and vitamin E (Î³-tocopherol) associated with unfavourable lipid levels. Higher triglycerides and lower HDL-C were correlated with higher levels of fat-soluble contaminants (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls and dibenzofurans). Nutrients and vitamin markers (e.g. vitamins B, D and carotenes), were associated with favourable triglyceride and HDL-C levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Our systematic association study has enabled us to postulate about broad environmental correlation to lipid levels. Although subject to confounding and reverse causality bias, these findings merit evaluation in additional cohorts.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chirag J.

7c59383c1278e1d509514102e061a47eeb247e2d,Scalable Architecture for Anomaly Detection and Visualization in Power Generating Assets,"Power-generating assets (e.g., jet engines, gas turbines) are often instrumented with tens to hundreds of sensors for monitoring physical and performance degradation. Anomaly detection algorithms highlight deviations from predetermined benchmarks with the goal of detecting incipient faults. We are developing an integrated system to address three key challenges within analyzing sensor data from power-generating assets: (1) difficulty in ingesting and analyzing data from large numbers of machines; (2) prevalence of false alarms generated by anomaly detection algorithms resulting in unnecessary downtime and maintenance; and (3) lack of an integrated visualization that helps users understand and explore the flagged anomalies and relevant sensor context in the energy domain. We present preliminary results and our key findings in addressing these challenges. Our system's scalable event ingestion framework, based on OpenTSDB, ingests nearly 400,000 sensor data samples per seconds using a 30 machine cluster. To reduce false alarm rates, we leverage the False Discovery Rate (FDR) algorithm which significantly reduces the number of false alarms. Our visualization tool presents the anomalies and associated content flagged by the FDR algorithm to inform users and practitioners in their decision making process. We believe our integrated platform will help reduce maintenance costs significantly while increasing asset lifespan. We are working to extend our system on multiple fronts, such as scaling to more data and more compute nodes (70 in total).",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Paras Jain"", ids = ""48963914""); list(name = ""Chirag Tailor"", ids = ""39307909""); list(name = ""Sam Ford"", ids = ""34914477""); list(name = ""Liexiao Ding"", ids = ""8801856""); list(name = ""Michael Phillips"", ids = ""145567973""); list(name = ""Fang Cherry Liu"", ids = ""40513781""); list(name = ""Nagi Gebraeel"", ids = ""1733223""); list(name = ""Duen Horng Chau"", ids = ""1793506"")",,e0398bac8adf7a3847a92b1a16b41bfb76cb7265; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; edac06ef9b2bc9062b7c92d740075e857c47eb88; 3784b73a1f392160523400ec0309191c0a96d86f; 316917c4ca1d12e570e660165759646cb700d20e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 92936ad88a5412bc48b86900da94b08fb7a3eefb; 71d1ac92ad36b62a04f32ed75a10ad3259a7218d; 9c52f106a4468a5f95f0cf87bf3462d40b6a1284; 204f6b76ebce1bcdc9a7b58aefdfd0d8a46745ef; a7ff205537c94fe8d693c6d44ba8da92d58fb034; 1f9a6a182c1755bbf4c0c7dc89033b8881f6ffc1; 3893b9d73a26b2dfaec6eb10cb59081afdfa83b0,2017 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW),,1078-1082
296d56ff458de65282e2064e03efa7942427b7a7,Estimation of false discovery rates for wavelet-denoised statistical parametric maps,"Correction for multiple comparisons in neuroimaging data is an important area of research. Recently, wavelet-based methods have gained popularity and have been reported to achieve better sensitivity compared to spatial domain methods. However, these techniques produce smoothed statistical maps which are difficult to interpret. The generated maps have to be thresholded again in the spatial domain to delineate active from inactive regions. The selection of a proper threshold satisfying the required error rate control is not straightforward. In this paper, a framework is proposed for thresholding wavelet-denoised maps in which a rejection region is fixed, and the achieved false discovery rate (FDR) is estimated. This approach provides a meaningful strategy to choose thresholds for wavelet-denoised statistical parametric maps (SPMs). Two FDR estimation algorithms were used to assess the achieved error rate control when thresholding wavelet filtered SPMs at various rejection regions. Their performance was evaluated using both simulated and resting fMRI data. The proposed framework was also applied on in vivo data.",2006,Medicine; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Srikanth Ryali"", ids = ""2294762""); list(name = ""Ramon Casanova"", ids = ""144016648""); list(name = ""Paul J.

ffbbdc51d091c9819fdd0a53cc2431ef7c063688,Racial variation in breast tumor promoter methylation in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study.,"BACKGROUND
African American (AA) women are diagnosed with more advanced breast cancers and have worse survival than white women, but a comprehensive understanding of the basis for this disparity remains unclear. Analysis of DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism that can regulate gene expression, could help to explain racial differences in breast tumor clinical biology and outcomes.


METHODS
DNA methylation was evaluated at 1,287 CpGs in the promoters of cancer-related genes in 517 breast tumors of AA (n = 216) or non-AA (n = 301) cases in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS).


RESULTS
Multivariable linear regression analysis of all tumors, controlling for age, menopausal status, stage, intrinsic subtype, and multiple comparisons [false discovery rate (FDR)], identified seven CpG probes that showed significant (adjusted P < 0.05) differential methylation between AAs and non-AAs. Stratified analyses detected an additional four CpG probes differing by race within hormone receptor-negative (HR(-)) tumors. Genes differentially methylated by race included DSC2, KCNK4, GSTM1, AXL, DNAJC15, HBII-52, TUSC3, and TES; the methylation state of several of these genes may be associated with worse survival in AAs. TCGA breast tumor data confirmed the differential methylation by race and negative correlations with expression for most of these genes. Several loci also showed racial differences in methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from CBCS cases, indicating that these variations were not necessarily tumor-specific.


CONCLUSIONS
Racial differences in the methylation of cancer-related genes are detectable in both tumors and PBLs from breast cancer cases.

e9948c0c3ebb9730be02f9c512d159dc6b94e127,"O22 Molecular epidemiology of noroviruses in British Columbia, Canada","Objective: One of the most devastating complications after organ transplantation is EBV-related lymphoproliferation. This condition is predominantly a B-cell disorder that is often associated with antecedent elevation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) loads. However, there is no consistent relationship between elevated EBV loads and the risk of progression to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). We hypothesized that aspects of the virus-host interaction could be measured to help predict progression to PTLD in settings where viral loads are elevated. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine differentially expressed host B cell-associated genes and their interaction patterns in different EBV viral load settings after pediatric organ transplantation. Specifically, we were interested in the genes expressed in high/intermediate (HI) versus low/undetectable (LU) viral load states. Methods: Gene expression was measured by microarray analysis of RNA from CD19+ B lymphocytes using the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip. Moderated t-statistics were computed for each gene using a local pooled error (LPE) test. The false discovery rates (FDR) of the differentially expressed genes were evaluated and validated using RT-PCR. In this report, the primary focus was on comparisons between patients with HI and LU viral loads (VL). Using averagelinkage hierarchical clustering analysis, a set of genes with the largest variation, as measured by coefficient of variation, was used to explore the patterns of viral loads. Gene network analysis was also performed. Results: Among samples from 27 transplant recipients, the VL categories were: low or undetectable loads, N = 14; high or intermediate loads, N = 13. There were 7 healthy EBV-seropositive (P) and -seronegative controls (N). The median age of transplant patients was 12.1 yrs (range 1 16.9); Median time post-transplant 0.5 yr (range 0.1 3.8). Using the LPE test, we identified 54 differentially expressed genes with FDR 0.1 when HI was compared with LU. In addition to our comparisons of interest (HI vs LU), we examined other comparisons; HI vs P, LU vs P and P vs N, respectively. Altogether, these comparisons yielded 24 54 differentially expressed genes. Clustering analysis of 563 gene expressions identified 5 clusters aligned with levels of VL. Conclusion: Our results revealed a spectrum of B-cell associated genes that includes several that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferation after organ transplantation. Further studies using the above methodology will shed further light on gene expression profiles in the setting of different viral load states after organ transplantation.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Patrick Tang"", ids = ""49987263""); list(name = ""Brian Auk"", ids = ""6846172""); list(name = ""S.

39e63cc72d47b568f2381406c9224ef5c4c3b0e6,Novel pathophysiological markers are revealed by iTRAQ-based quantitative clinical proteomics approach in vascular dementia,"UNLABELLED
Vascular dementia (VaD) is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly together with Alzheimer's disease with limited treatment options. Poor understanding of the pathophysiology underlying VaD is hindering the development of new therapies. Hence, to unravel its underlying molecular pathology, an iTRAQ-2D-LC-MS/MS strategy was used for quantitative analysis of pooled lysates from Brodmann area 21 of pathologically confirmed cases of VaD and matched non-neurological controls. A total of 144 differentially expressed proteins out of 2281 confidently identified proteins (false discovery rate=0.3%) were shortlisted for bioinformatics analysis. Western blot analysis of selected proteins using samples from individual patients (n=10 per group) showed statistically significant increases in the abundance of SOD1 and NCAM and reduced ATP5A in VaD. This suggested a state of hypometabolism and vascular insufficiency along with an inflammatory condition during VaD. Elevation of SOD1 and increasing trend for iron-storage proteins (FTL, FTH1) may be indicative of an oxidative imbalance that is accompanied by an aberrant iron metabolism. The synaptic proteins did not exhibit a generalized decrease in abundance (e.g. syntaxin) in the VaD subjects. This reported proteome offers a reference data set for future basic or translational studies on VaD.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Our study is the first quantitative clinical proteomic study where iTRAQ-2D-LC-MS/MS strategy has been used to identify the differential proteome in the VaD cortex by comparing VaD and matched control subjects. We generate testable hypothesis about the involvement of various proteins in the vascular and parenchymal events during the evolution of VaD that finally leads to malfunction and demise of brain cells. This study also establishes quantitative proteomics as a complementary approach and viable alternative to existing neurochemical, electron microscopic and neuroimaging techniques that are traditionally being used to understand the molecular pathology of VaD. Our study could inspire fellow researchers to initiate similar retrospective studies targeting various ethnicities, age-groups or sub-types of VaD using brain samples available from brain banks across the world. Meta-analysis of these studies in the future may be able to shortlist candidate proteins or pathways for rationale exploration of therapeutic targets or biomarkers for VaD.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Arnab Datta"", ids = ""39913506""); list(name = ""Jingru Qian"", ids = ""6008348""); list(name = ""Ruifen Chong"", ids = ""46868747""); list(name = ""Raj N Kalaria"", ids = ""34676876""); list(name = ""Paul T Francis"", ids = ""33995129""); list(name = ""Mitchell K P Lai"", ids = ""144323278""); list(name = ""Christopher Phillip Chen"", ids = ""48240577""); list(name = ""Siu Kwan Sze"", ids = ""145270496"")",9913993c3eeba70807031f807b8cea6ffffd26d5; 13ce1dfbd03a63c9d6ac333d4e1a9b0f655667a7; 612cbd5d0c7a5069c9c8b6d9816677377a51afba; 6c8abaca71167718b66c85446ff0a9f41141b47e; f19cfe39fcd6292f640fb0aea254425f8cf3fc19; e4450c91c5df1f37a9e1f40f1c774dc9a42fbc2f; 573520b84107e56bf698b6bdf50203b1fd5f8ed8; 8d0c7a5fe35fdb33d6cfdea1361aba64343a19b1; c1dc0487841c31d00279b589257ac12515070576; 5f1c52bde3fa6d864b5641ca0e08d412668d4f9a; e8a086fa5b9bb004b3063ceea07165ce7bc19746; 0547961216931ae769d555c51f5944db34463143; 410992769dccdef27a48fdb8b1cf3141a50f3b59; 4069375028e965e07b42f99008cef6cddad898a2; 371419c099f65f55bd36ba2aa6ac05bc4c69c2d9,fc4499319c3c461e359e094972543aba3f6ee79e; 7b8486805622773a72fdf6c61dc70ca2241eec6e; 24f09c0c30041f431362c7fe2c0111e58d23d802; 2424dd3202fc9f9668dc3471f0564ab436ffbf0f; d4fdc4f4efb4ff7466a012298604644bedfb7917; c18b1e1062ae2fe01d4b5cce75a22277cc51c820; 79ab3e8a3bfef22bc21f3c08dfc5cd9b7b632d3b; 544c10a0500b487f2751fc2bc367d36e28bb2553; 94ff6ac108cc105c578f838df2f814c1dfac976c; ad9838aa187cef5ce2b30c97868c30ffab94f319; cd9feba1287c70f4b5fb2acc1ba868595672d137; c8a575eb6be67a9bf926e555e21c41ae598ac859; 3a1489e9a571b7f67c741f22bf23131733aa9075; 7289f6ccbe433da35bd8b14fb782b665af909b46; e5f95ac06884f8fce7d93082ef2f82cc5265c602; 1661090ceda4c0b581cb857eb8cc220095935ee6; 8353dc1231b143323cabc637acb3a3e7c31facc3; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; f25e3f21bf3cd90f1d91816a9544dbeb2fe1af12; 619eb992345b6d8ffb66a5fd29255f447dd7509b; 713581eb774e90476174d408c899f5e9f1548b7f; 60e48f4059114bb288f523ce97bd4e487fb6a6cb; 7d33b28d97d5f4aedbfbbaa86e80ad581e10cbbc; 36df41ef05caaf03bd6bd51b45c2bd98891f6494; 8d84b50bcee6f24b727ef879a03b2be5eb56654a; ec4207f77d102cfa4302491e7f4d437a7376d3d0; bf3e92720c3cd54fe772d7a619bd54a43d3174f9; 137011de794e5b7de3569788cce7665f4a1bdf6e; bb804dc7557a8c16ede0ee517723d09fac0504a7; 6a51cf60004e1e330254553f4fc5cd59a21163e9; 51da4445b4187a96be30531c417fc585e2b0aa6d; 7609cf243fef9dff59b6db16184d9fdb05f53791; 7bad00c1a00c5e8d1b6cf2ac16305ade56cf0b40; 45773f70e789342bb748f0d76d7841ea4294f20b; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; f4fecb569b79bedea4bc1a5cd96d0bf3efc68e7f; 8ca2bfb09820f9da88d62a822bf5daf950d60bf1; d5f08b7064d9808a35abd6c3acf498d5564428e5; d6e708153e1093ddd52f60f2b11099481d612a38; 434a93b6adcc47505b1d17c208432d3ee63fef16; f04d04870f852ea5488cb21e79728e970779d0f5; b0a49064664e0f14f746d8877368ed7f333ff94c; 2e7f1c22f218434f2bae9247770cfbea7fb90625,Journal of Proteomics,99,54 - 67

f96345c0678300c5fe967cd9b6642dc784d6523f,Prenatal Infection and Autism Spectrum Disorders in Childhood: A Population-Based Case-Control Study in Taiwan.,"BACKGROUND
Infection in pregnancy has long been linked with negative postnatal development and health. This study aims to assess the association between prenatal infections and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across three trimesters and to probe possible sex heterogeneity in such link.


METHOD
A total of 4184 children with incident ASDs and 16,734 matched children were identified from the 2000-2007 National Health Insurance Research Database. For each child, information pertaining to the mother's infection during pregnancy, sociodemographics, and medical history was retrieved from healthcare records. Conditional logistic analyses were carried out to estimate the strength of associations with adjustment for multiple comparisons.


RESULT
Pooled analyses demonstrated that having two or more outpatient visits for genital infection [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.34; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.12, 1.60; false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰< 0.01] and bacterial infection (aOR: 1.24; 95% CI 1.06, 1.43; FDRâ€‰< 0.05) in the third trimester were slightly associated with increased risk of ASDs. No statistically significant sex differences were found.


CONCLUSION
The present study contributes updated population-based evidence about the connection between prenatal infection and ASDs.

be746fdd7b50ff1da970a27af70e954f37cd6079,Trends and variability in extreme precipitation indices over Maghreb countries,"Maghreb countries are highly vulnerable to ex- treme hydrological events, such as floods and droughts, driven by the strong variability of precipitation. While sev- eral studies have analyzed the presence of trends in precip- itation records for the Euro-Mediterranean basin, this study provides a regional assessment of trends on its southernmost shores. A database of 22 stations located in Algeria, Mo- rocco and Tunisia with between 33 and 59 yr of daily precip- itation records is considered. The change points and trends are analyzed for eleven climate indices, describing several features of the precipitation regime. The issue of conduct- ing multiple hypothesis tests is addressed through the im- plementation of a false discovery rate procedure. The spa- tial and interannual variability of the precipitation indices at the different stations are analyzed and compared with large- scale atmospheric circulation patterns, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), western Mediterranean Oscil- lation (WEMO), Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results show a strong tendency towards a decrease of precipitation totals and wet days together with an increase in the duration of dry periods, mainly for Morocco and western Algeria. On the other hand, only a few significant trends are detected for heavy precipi- tation indices. The NAO and MO patterns are well correlated with precipitation indices describing precipitation amounts, the number of dry days and the length of wet and dry pe- riods, whereas heavy precipitation indices exhibit a strong spatial variability and are only moderately correlated with large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns.",2013,Geology,"list(name = ""Yves Tramblay"", ids = ""11765071""); list(name = ""Salaheddine El Adlouni"", ids = ""3021432""); list(name = ""Eric Servat"", ids = ""88060080"")",39552928bc80406164f42f27c01f359ede41f8cb; 0b9de61b06465542ff6ed16745136e2e63395f62; 365b6adb536525c4836f9bcd849d5775b5378eb2; b1b47cef0dd9b2923eea0c96b76bcb2f029aad3f; ee26c29d5ffb46020ab2c0b75e33a77d61cf06f1; 639ae2e3895757ff8b4f056023cf22b528c519be; 385f6b423939dd1fb23b6c1379814716c0f16702; 95885df667bc977dd688d1f71261437a72e86427; c11c9222fd929f0fb7b11652457a3407ec93c34e; ed8e535f1dea8db315f2bbc8a1e36856df0dbf59; edc5508b817615a9e5e25456dc37107318c091e0; a2c27e666d226f1690117aa1e275baaa35004922; abc159db6c96a7629036ce2154e16df0ffca653f; 58627ccabeb87b7622d60445738cf826d7defc12; 311f8335bde43439335e8f80e203f6fb3e71888a; 5688f6b8c5d69ecf4267be0870164cb6003243a5; 61f861170dcee814a84f7a664fa1aff1269690f1; a3e1b555e2ad3eabf0aba68dcdc56a41b44b6c88; 9b9856f6016c03c631d116be6e71163c5e803cdf; fbc79dbcb0dcfb510805dabd4f82b8d65b850c94; 401f60a7df45a125d995aa2f245dba1c0f80e5a5; 2bc2cc99d556289a1208aa4fd96b0af0873b3a17; cdf90fc2654906e12add34623c3ee34df5ca36f9; 0b5c0b8ce6794f52b8464726f71c2db29e024fce; ab9b3bf2a05fcc72fc98a0b0bc1ca594d242be71; 3c3b1831d84ba67c908152645e85ab0a0d1c93a6; 28cd3849248382170ec8e72782fa954e64ec3a00; 8428fb06a0cfbe2c2d616c2a6ff22ddef8756398; dfcd192580febe57e9ce80f83aa64bc4afbbce8f; 9c6b3a35237d4f4da9889aa3782bad73b305a10a; c039e1c9c4988a8b3a0387dc68ff425b40c55961; c56b29232818fdc3eac2877abbd88c53be41872c; 26771f24646368e28b4729ceebbc651d76813d1f; 9338603ad5c9f63516200d8662d18f67305247ca; 6a2095f176aee1bcdeb49d30bddd8bd5af6bdac3; 370c8cb45ed88b5586d8c4a03743760ea6210ff7; fcc1b4384d7b7e95996dde4f7c808d3704642b3e; 93362ff08223441940c95feb98e0aa3b97031f50; 0991f22cb228bd2721ce66f105fe9f5bcf589033; ab994f579fbdd6f611c2932f10674d5e98f54a21,c07fb0b1a6a6176d939e11b252e17dbd109aee94; 60460d14973003bbb347173086f9a7597a2c4713; e477e6b2d0977208e7bb2ad3518cccf94c03a80e; eb4852766d96023d7120ba5118bb167469b496c7; 2d09c9fb49d3e1db90868b76956ba002430a0e5b; e947d04861eadd0a446aa71a464cb9227a3dc4eb; 0b30bc7b97e581975bf4e4272e0ecd25f1fd2c7e; 75f91bff0d1fc6bf5c8bf21ea7c4bea16c53c453; 77f058931730e61ff2cabd26e981ab783c91e202; 7b746d7dea9761d12d5e3dadf69662d9370557e3; e2cf97a960dab616f60bf777b7ca6be2e2aec749; 7233a795a11aa8521fc6fecd2ce2544aead9319b; a0082bcd4081602ea44aff74e97b058fc1d9ff6c; 982f772a2bff98f71dedbb326402e4c8e3179d80; 8e423392404af12c025be0bbbe4a0670057350d5; 995d8a1e9d28e4388620fbad2635bd063381d413; 483d790d2c9ab37c808d4cc6b2f58091606027e6; 60bee82915faa6d255233e8d25d5ceff45d1a57b; 4f5f6e5896da08fd70b17f9d8eec141ae9c9f626; b4d012dfcd8d77bf4203c5ab2f29ba858b828cca; 4283a6212ebdcb4dcc0f1297796f093f9e1f5b08; 1058db65aa32ed7f043fcaad62f1270d820b1d81; 9637e6b277603abd6bd2a3d26ded5d2135d931f5; f8c9db10b44534b8ef97641b70ec7e5339cb7c0d; 805ebdc2699508b0c3c0f7d9492a6295acfc25cf; ce6c6f2f6db7b3121c0205efb1461660ddb074e1; 2e9d7b6830ce8a0105c2047c294a8dadc121fd74; c92b8d94bfa68bc246eda16ecc5d0dc924f1fbe7; d7bfd578891f24e49b85ab9a06c26f831c62c02e; 90bfacc613b48f938f4c3d14505c9560bcae7ccf; d20147097a4d7352ac70d2064348e62bf172c5b7; 1f65262843b7ee34adb994e7bde6e1d5f8bf7c53; 4360a8ec4c1becf51de45e5e12b4b4cb8ffb3e9c; 45b7ed1cd8e4f86e065b9eade2cc60e8b9e8b5ed; 7f0ac69e56f32bd0e83aa593883ebc5b1867655a; e6df2e2dda50211c60395c8f5d3f988b04028e7a; e6a1c96fd731b012121277db04ae46ca2dcc1cbc; c998dfe821fb6f9b44228ba51a68a57ca1cacb1a; 75c92aba4cc42df9feb6852bf3cc9f3ef4450b6b; 8e75f51d95803cd72178e00ed7cbf681cff6b9c9; e4f687ceaa5005c7cd332cf22a6a6c13d8b3d840; f4a0e67c635da21074304f73888a3e6e8a56a7a6; d6afe23b0e0dae9cdd7f29b17eeccd77bb326a91; e3302d4b93da1a9479faa3c72f1053587d580b7a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b36d42cd6e62f5b116b777e191c9ac742dcfe1a3; 8004847c2995e26d04229a40d4c18c92647bb74b; 7fac62d66d80b11a5034b7ce1ec54390124da412; 2899514c29b9363cd710c0f02c44f9fec0497a23; b74a3c77702d1d5ffa83eabb1b9a7cbed08e1b05; d65a12460b954c752677f0deea3a31cbff9390cb; b84626fca2ef29bc834b0a43e18cf4ee734f41d0; aac0b9bb6049a5e122dbbeb01e74375d5d983b32; 648882b582aa9446c1a9952330c17becaae3fecd; 114c86055a092b774513b488b00a4ee1ea09d521; e56912e6648e00ec09edea8e4672e456a25f43c5; af56f15bf6515b728edf24e3b9abdbdac28f23b7; ee4d95edc2db5f47fe7fb9bfe2a26b238d1ef3e0; 4a93dbfc197db3f6bce6d67cd8a60f8b97ef00b1; ff181395277ae7402f13f0a2c24a7525a2a09c71; 751b04d346fc9a70781bbfea23953f424ff7deec; 521fd6632a5a8dd6a9ad3760b41c93f38b135543,Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,13,3235-3248

However, the complete effect of LPL hydrolysis products and its free fatty acid (FFA) component on modifying genes associated with macrophage-derived foam cell formation are not fully understood. I hypothesized that the FFA liberated from lipoproteins by LPL affects the gene expression in macrophages to potentially promote atherogenesis. Human microarray analyses on the RNA isolated from THP-1 macrophages treated with lipoprotein hydrolysis products generated by LPL revealed that selected genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, cell cycling, stress response, type I interferon signaling, and lipid accumulation were affected (at false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.03, n=3). Testing the effects of either the total FFA component of the hydrolysis products, or individual classes of the FFA component, revealed mixed effects on the gene expression profiles. Overall, LPL hydrolysis products appear to affect gene expression profiles that favor foam cell formation, but it is likely that components other than the FFA differentially affect macrophage gene expression.",2017,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Narmadaa Thyagarajan"", ids = ""9038579"")",7db3bb75810f6c8360d512eb74fbf95ae7b6bba5,,,,
4bd46647b4dd58e8ea0878f6074b89ef63eba2d0,Empirical Bayes estimation of posterior probabilities of enrichment: A comparative study of five estimators of the local false discovery rate,"BackgroundIn investigating differentially expressed genes or other selected features, researchers conduct hypothesis tests to determine which biological categories, such as those of the Gene Ontology (GO), are enriched for the selected features. Multiple comparison procedures (MCPs) are commonly used to prevent excessive false positive rates. Traditional MCPs, e.g., the Bonferroni method, go to the opposite extreme: strictly controlling a family-wise error rate, resulting in excessive false negative rates. Researchers generally prefer the more balanced approach of instead controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). However, the q-values that methods of FDR control assign to biological categories tend to be too low to reliably estimate the probability that a biological category is not enriched for the preselected features. Thus, we study an application of the other estimators of that probability, which is called the local FDR (LFDR).ResultsWe considered five LFDR estimators for detecting enriched GO terms: a binomial-based estimator (BBE), a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), a normalized MLE (NMLE), a histogram-based estimator assuming a theoretical null hypothesis (HBE), and a histogram-based estimator assuming an empirical null hypothesis (HBE-EN). Since NMLE depends not only on the data but also on the specified value of Î 0, the proportion of non-enriched GO terms, it is only advantageous when either Î 0 is already known with sufficient accuracy or there are data for only 1 GO term. By contrast, the other estimators work without specifying Î 0 but require data for at least 2 GO terms. Our simulation studies yielded the following summaries of the relative performance of each of those four estimators. HBE and HBE-EN produced larger biases for 2, 4, 8, 32, and 100 GO terms than BBE and MLE. BBE has the lowest bias if Î 0 is 1 and if the number of GO terms is between 2 and 32. The bias of MLE is no worse than that of BBE for 100 GO terms even when the ideal number of components in its underlying mixture model is unknown, but has high bias when the number of GO terms is small compared to the number of estimated parameters. For unknown values of Î 0, BBE has the lowest bias for a small number of GO terms (2-32 GO terms), and MLE has the lowest bias for a medium number of GO terms (100 GO terms).ConclusionsFor enrichment detection, we recommend estimating the LFDR by MLE given at least a medium number of GO terms, by BBE given a small number of GO terms, and by NMLE given either only 1 GO term or precise knowledge of Î 0.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine; Biology; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhenyu Yang"", ids = ""144285797""); list(name = ""Zuojing Li"", ids = ""46947314""); list(name = ""David R.

4df14322bef1c93fe463bb8ac0be3f90ea0e48db,A statistical algorithm for detecting cognitive plateaus in Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"Repeated neuropsychological measurements, such as mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, are frequently used in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) research to study change in cognitive function of AD patients. A question of interest among dementia researchers is whether some AD patients exhibit transient â€œplateausâ€ of cognitive function in the course of the disease. We consider a statistical approach to this question, based on irregularly spaced repeated MMSE scores. We propose an algorithm that formalizes the measurement of an apparent cognitive plateau, and a procedure to evaluate the evidence of plateaus in AD using this algorithm based on applying the algorithm to the observed data and to data sets simulated from a linear mixed model. We apply these methods to repeated MMSE data from the Michigan Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center, finding a high rate of apparent plateaus and also a high rate of false discovery. Simulation studies are also conducted to assess the performance of the algorithm. In general, the false discovery rate of the algorithm is high unless the rate of decline is high compared with the measurement error of the cognitive test. It is argued that the results are not a problem of the specific algorithm chosen, but reflect a lack of information concerning the presence of plateaus in the data.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Hyonggin An"", ids = ""35730872""); list(name = ""Roderick J.

ec14af8dfb1b727a685e068a7769ec6f45b5f759,"Identification of additive, dominant, and epistatic variation conferred by key genes in cellulose biosynthesis pathway in Populus tomentosaâ€ ","Economically important traits in many species generally show polygenic, quantitative inheritance. The components of genetic variation (additive, dominant and epistatic effects) of these traits conferred by multiple genes in shared biological pathways remain to be defined. Here, we investigated 11 full-length genes in cellulose biosynthesis, on 10 growth and wood-property traits, within a population of 460 unrelated Populus tomentosa individuals, via multi-gene association. To validate positive associations, we conducted single-marker analysis in a linkage population of 1,200 individuals. We identified 118, 121, and 43 associations (P< 0.01) corresponding to additive, dominant, and epistatic effects, respectively, with low to moderate proportions of phenotypic variance (R(2)). Epistatic interaction models uncovered a combination of three non-synonymous sites from three unique genes, representing a significant epistasis for diameter at breast height and stem volume. Single-marker analysis validated 61 associations (false discovery rate, Q â‰¤ 0.10), representing 38 SNPs from nine genes, and its average effect (R(2) = 3.8%) nearly 2-fold higher than that identified with multi-gene association, suggesting that multi-gene association can capture smaller individual variants. Moreover, a structural gene-gene network based on tissue-specific transcript abundances provides a better understanding of the multi-gene pathway affecting tree growth and lignocellulose biosynthesis. Our study highlights the importance of pathway-based multiple gene associations to uncover the nature of genetic variance for quantitative traits and may drive novel progress in molecular breeding.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qingzhang Du"", ids = ""3873809""); list(name = ""Jiaxing Tian"", ids = ""4058615""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Yang"", ids = ""2467564""); list(name = ""Wei Pan"", ids = ""1684285""); list(name = ""Baohua Xu"", ids = ""32782513""); list(name = ""Bailian LiB.

This is an age and body mass index matched case-control study comparing the methylation patterns of 27,578 cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in 14,495 genes in maternal leukocyte DNA in early pregnancy (n = 14), in the same women postpartum (n = 14), and in nulligravid women (n = 14) on a BeadChip platform. Transient widespread hypomethylation was found in early pregnancy as compared with the non-pregnant states. Methylation of nine genes was significantly different in early pregnancy compared with both postpartum and nulligravid states (< 10% False Discovery Rate). Early pregnancy may be characterized by widespread hypomethylation compared with non-pregnant states; there is no apparent permanent methylation imprint after a normal term gestation. Nine potential candidate genes were identified as differentially methylated in early pregnancy and may play a role in the maternal adaptation to pregnancy.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wendy M.

73f132a44b3e858bf09806917b60583adf505050,Integrated analysis of different microarray studies to identify candidate genes in type 1 diabetes,"BACKGROUND
Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease, occurs most commonly in children. Identifying altered gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T1D may lead to new strategies for preserving or improving Î²-ell function in patients with T1D.


METHODS
The Gene Expression Omnibus database was searched for microarray studies in PBMCs of T1D. Subsequently, gene expression datasets from multiple microarray studies were integrated to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between T1D and normal controls (NC). Gene function analysis was performed to determine the functions of the DEGs identified.


RESULTS
Four microarray studies were available for analysis, including 199 T1D samples and 74 NC samples. Analysis revealed 695 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in PBMCs from T1D compared with NC samples, with 450 upregulated and 245 downregulated. Signal transduction (gene ontology [GO]: 0007165; false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰=â€‰1.54â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7 ) and protein binding (GO: 0005515; FDRâ€‰=â€‰2.93â€‰Ã—â€‰10-24 ) were significantly enriched for the GO categories of biological processes and molecular functions, respectively. The most significant pathway in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis was arachidonic acid metabolism (FDRâ€‰=â€‰1.44â€‰Ã—â€‰10-3 ). Protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that the significant hub proteins contained immature colon carcinoma transcriptÂ 1 (ICT1; degreeâ€‰=â€‰214; clustering coefficient [C]â€‰=â€‰4.39â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 ), zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16; degreeâ€‰=â€‰112; Câ€‰=â€‰8.04â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4 ), and SERTA domain containing 1 (SERTAD1; degreeâ€‰=â€‰38; Câ€‰=â€‰0.0014).

We present the results of a small survey into the current practice of scenario analysis by simulation practitioners and academics. Although the survey was small, the results indicated that the range of scenarios used in DES studies may prohibit the use of FWER control methods such as the Bonferroni Correction referred to in DES textbooks. Furthermore, 80% of our sample were not familiar with multiple comparison control.

2508db139afc66e2f004ef1510533ef4ac355dde,Persistent low body weight in humans is associated with higher mitochondrial activity in white adipose tissue,"BACKGROUND
Constitutional thinness (CT) is a state of low but stable body weight (BMIÂ â‰¤18 kg/m2). CT subjects have normal-range hormonal profiles and food intake but exhibit resistance to weight gain despite living in the modern world's obesogenic environment.


OBJECTIVE
The goal of this study is to identify molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenotype against weight gain.


METHODS
We conducted a clinical overfeeding study on 30 CT subjects and 30 controls (BMI 20-25 kg/m2) matched for age and sex. We performed clinical and integrative molecular and transcriptomic analyses on white adipose and muscle tissues.


RESULTS
Our results demonstrate that adipocytes were markedly smaller in CT individuals (meanÂ Â±Â SEM: 2174Â Â±Â 142 Î¼m 2) compared with controls (3586Â Â±Â 216 Î¼m2) (PÂ <Â 0.01). The mitochondrial respiratory capacity was higher in CT adipose tissue, particularly at the level of complex II of the electron transport chain (2.2-fold increase; PÂ <Â 0.01). This higher activity was paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial number (CT compared with control: 784Â Â±Â 27 compared with 675Â Â±Â 30 mitochondrial DNA molecules per cell; PÂ <Â 0.05). No evidence for uncoupled respiration or ""browning"" of the white adipose tissue was found. In accordance with the mitochondrial differences, CT subjects had a distinct adipose transcriptomic profile [62 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate of 0.1 and log fold changeÂ >0.75)], with many differentially expressed genes associating with positive metabolic outcomes. Pathway analyses revealed an increase in fatty acid oxidation ( PÂ =Â 3Â Ã—Â 10-04) but also triglyceride biosynthesis (PÂ =Â 3.6Â Ã—Â 10-04). No differential response to the overfeeding was observed in the 2 groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The distinct molecular signature of the adipose tissue in CT individuals suggests the presence of augm ented futile lipid cycling, rather than mitochondrial uncoupling, as a way to increase energy expenditure in CT individuals.

3b4c2ea7458cfddaf48b95e23444eaa1380b0d8a,Marginal false discovery rates for penalized likelihood methods,"The recent popularity of penalized regression in high-dimensional data analysis has lead to a demand for new inferential tools for these models. False discovery rate control is a well known aspect of other high-dimensional data analysis approaches that has only recently been considered in the context of penalized regression. However much of the current research has been focused primarily on lasso-penalized linear regression, despite the availability of software that can fit penalized regression models to a variety of likelihood-based models. In this paper we derive a method of estimating the marginal false discovery rate for penalized likelihood methods and demonstrate its application to penalized logistic and penalized Cox regression models. Our approach is fast, flexible and can be applied to a variety of penalty functions including lasso, elastic net, MCP, and MNet. We derive theoretical results under which the proposed estimator is valid, and use simulation studies to demonstrate that the approach is reasonably robust, albeit slightly conservative, when these assumptions are violated. The practical utility of the method is demonstrated on two gene expression data sets with binary and surival outcomes, which we respectively analyze using penalized logistic and penalized Cox regression.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ryan Miller"", ids = ""47187948""); list(name = ""Patrick J Breheny"", ids = ""2119683"")",9e8efd072240b6eeb6d39b82395a2ccb143d7774; 7ac54398e4bac7ff93313e34e19a6f2baa42f91b,905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; 0006e865f2e9d8a0d613f0443622eb5d15a388b2; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 2f0f2eeff47530102a44fe683e25fc2c3db6094c; 3bec87a01916d25f8393a8815fc75495fcef1e97; a2dae138cd4ade308d0e6438bfc67c49ad422005; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; db4b1e3f367ddcea27d660d3316f2916bf2ba84a; 86c35680190dcb1a040243927e98e4ca08f8d80e; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 1ba4fcafbe3e184dbd207ee5d491808a1bb42187; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; 57a7c5db6aaab825200b85beb0bebefaee15117c; b9f6e9ac6c1f07a1875b07791ab08a9d37936f14; 5ea7513c23122b035aeaf9d24a38889e86de6069; e6676264d3af3604ee25f931aae78448b924fcf2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b800f9dde3ee805463172f38db62b79b2a8ce98a; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9,,,

They also drive intestinal stem cell proliferation and positioning, control intestinal tissue boundaries and are involved in liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, indicating involvement in additional digestive system malignancies. We investigated the role of Ephrin-B4 receptor (EPHB4), and its ligand EFNB2, in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers in patient cohorts through computational, mathematical, molecular and immunohistochemical analyses. We show that EPHB4 is upregulated in preneoplastic gastroesophageal lesions and its expression further increased in gastroesophageal cancers in several independent cohorts. The closely related EPHB6 receptor, which also binds EFNB2, was downregulated in all tested cohorts, consistent with its tumor-suppressive properties in other cancers. EFNB2 expression is induced in esophageal cells by acidity, suggesting that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may constitute an early triggering event in activating EFNB2-EPHB4 signaling. Association of EPHB4 to both Barrett's esophagus and to advanced tumor stages, and its overexpression at the tumor invasion front and vascular endothelial cells intimate the notion that EPHB4 may be associated with multiple steps of gastroesophageal tumorigenesis. Analysis of oncogenomic signatures uncovered the first EPHB4-associated gene network (false discovery rate: 7 Ã— 10(-90) ) composed of a five-transcription factor interconnected gene network that drives proliferation, angiogenesis and invasiveness. The EPHB4 oncogenomic network provides a molecular basis for its role in tumor progression and points to EPHB4 as a potential tumor aggressiveness biomarker and drug target in gastroesophageal cancers.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Britta Liersch-LÃ¶hn"", ids = ""1421943553""); list(name = ""Nadia Slavova"", ids = ""24542735""); list(name = ""Heinz J.

9f456ce2ad7a9c45e16ecbc50c20bedfbd7a7add,Spatio-temporal relations between temperature and precipitation regimes: Implications for temperature-induced changes in the hydrological cycle,"Abstract Changes in the precipitation regime as a result of temperature changes are important for water resources management and management of water-related natural hazards. In this study, daily temperature and precipitation datasets from 590 stations from across China are analyzed to investigate possible relations between precipitation and temperature regimes in both space and time. The K-means method is applied to group 590 stations into 4 homogenous sub-regions and then trends are detected by the modified Mannâ€“Kendall test. The field significance test and false discovery rate approaches are used to determine spatial correlations. Results show that: (1) significant increases in temperature extremes are detected across China. However, the magnitude of increase in the minimum temperature is larger than that in the maximum temperature. The warming in China is reflected mainly by the remarkable increase in the minimum temperature; (2) precipitation changes are extremely uneven in both space and time. Generally, a wetting tendency is detected in western China, and a drying tendency in northeastern China annually and in summer. In winter, however, a wetting tendency is observed; and (3) different regional responses of precipitation extremes to increasing temperature can be identified across China. Under the influence of increasing temperature, precipitation is intensifying in southeastern China and winter is having a wetting tendency. The responses of changes in weak precipitation extremes to climate warming are comparatively complicated and diverse. Even then it can be confirmed that increasing temperature tends to trigger the intensification of precipitation. Temporal and spatial changes of water vapor divergence can well aid in the interpretation of seasonal and spatial alterations of precipitation regimes. Temperature changes can influence precipitation changes by altering thermo-dynamic properties of air mass and hence the moisture transportation.",2013,Geology,"list(name = ""Qiang Zhang"", ids = ""32605904""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Li"", ids = ""49298625""); list(name = ""Vijay P.

In this work, we address significance in the context of frequent itemset mining. Specifically, we develop a novel methodology to identify a meaningful support threshold s* for a dataset, such that the number of itemsets with support at least s* represents a substantial deviation from what would be expected in a random dataset with the same number of transactions and the same individual item frequencies. These itemsets can then be flagged as statistically significant with a small false discovery rate.

49a71179d4bcc34996435ebf96e3706c9d492b5b,Resistin Is a Novel Marker for Postoperative Pain Intensity,"BACKGROUND: Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (adipokines) associated with adipose tissue can modulate inflammatory processes and lead to systemic inflammatory conditions such as metabolic syndrome. In the present pilot study, we investigated 3 major adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and resistin) and 2 nonspecific proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor &agr; and interleukin-6) with regard to their association with postoperative pain intensity. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 45 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the adipokines in 57 patients with postlaparotomy pain. We adjusted for multiple testing to reduce the chance of false-positive results by controlling the false discovery rate. Serum levels of the adipokines and proinflammatory cytokines were measured in another 36 patients undergoing laparotomy. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis using these measurements and opioid dosages as independent variables was performed to explore the factors associated with postoperative pain. RESULTS: Only 1 variant of the resistin gene (rs3745367) demonstrated a significant association with postoperative pain (P < .002). Patients exhibiting homozygosity for the minor alleles (n = 7; numerical rating scale [NRS], 2.3 Â± 1.3) demonstrated lower pain intensity compared with those exhibiting homozygosity for the major alleles (n = 29; NRS, 3.8 Â± 1.0; P = .004) and heterozygosity for the minor alleles (n = 21; NRS, 4.2 Â± 0.8; P < .001). Only serum resistin levels showed a positive association with postoperative pain. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant of resistin and serum resistin levels were associated with postoperative pain intensity, while other adipokines and cytokines exhibit no such association. Resistin can alter the inflammatory responses in postoperative wounds, although it could be a determinant factor that is independent of inflammatory processes. Resistin may be a novel marker for postoperative pain intensity.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jun Hozumi"", ids = ""6937463""); list(name = ""Masahiko Sumitani"", ids = ""1762984""); list(name = ""Daisuke Nishizawa"", ids = ""5625856""); list(name = ""Makoto Nagashima"", ids = ""4383312""); list(name = ""Kazutaka Ikeda"", ids = ""6655319""); list(name = ""Hiroaki Abe"", ids = ""47243139""); list(name = ""Ryoji Kato"", ids = ""47561735""); list(name = ""Yoshiomi Kusakabe"", ids = ""14047181""); list(name = ""Yoshitsugu Yamada"", ids = ""6836857"")",26756905b18b1e5101ea6e7bc3673cb126f94bd4; a40e090b13eebd4debb845640d645f0f2f8a035d; 25c0dc84f52ae2c7444efe1e64b4a674829fad6f,ba9ec311d2b673ef8605f9d4d26f24d5983a12ad; 21b15031600b0474562e34f35d7b37d940b4e01e; 753074b550a532f8ae5abb91dbe9035e19861c13; f1a304ab83cdc34198123320549617ca8702b044; 43020c3461e4c36d4c632967a002cf21ecd467a1; c0fb596e027e13ae91c261cc6128e46e0a2acfcf; 7cdae9ece0e94ad740189e7b328bbf6993b4c8d5; 599c618693f085274b08e690d77b1716a790c2f7; fdec6776e6c12fbcee6972e0740296638174ea09; edf7440d0ba4b0f8f69c3e0ae65e626ca50e118b; da6a2ddde192bcc623b74f5d4b026201c7536272; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 6c0fa0d2ca2f8d010636f06fbffcf6329297346a; 62f7f283ab78f6f2d534feda9b0fbd2868bda5cb; 307484f0d73df527a75956d89200a11bac0038a3; 37983e55f2b5126a6d0f1cdbbbb224c5094eb32d; d8e1c556a7164fcdd09dcf40c4fa110cf9a8c984; f50d049d4810b343de14ab72c9cb78ce01a549fd; 4533cc7cb107edb762748670b79902077e4fb135; d9a200e06fccc9c3ca852e36a1df3f3d161775e2; 83b5d498e032abb6a4f46e681f10cae4e944185a; e7209708f4b953cbf59443733ad6b11e192fa77c; f11b98118a5871783d8cb59c0fae8908db7df06f; 9d97c8d58d2e0c659a8c7971d4a065a019b11d1a; 5f9882eefd119712babc2768e9fafe16bba13d3e; ec8ba00eb52adfcfd9519791fbcf621aa955520d; c7989bb69aad6ecad1980189289234abaa84456a; f0995b0386f346f85ab207096ec65af563b26456; 3f9f2ddf233edaf53c8c9a15878bd49a182f29f1; c01bfbe3a3acd5dd62cb1e3eb7cba26fc18f3b3a; 8e86cab7264196f0c4768acf1f2e3b188dc7c80d; ccdb815d66cc103c34d873e0d207a4a162104e95; f61faf6682e5150a21e11101068ffc526fc1e4be; 84f5214767347c62b5cb7bd07ded7af83b8943f9; 8e0a64a358549815b709b9b5f2cc2eb54542e839; e97e2fb7fc710e7c3e02cf291bd33c4ed2162269; 5fff7d88be3065aa261b7058153178aaed8ee8b8; ade95f0fd21bd20acd578ae36d0536bac7d464ce; 7586b2c1210b3f14fc7830f7348c7a997cd244f2,Anesthesia & Analgesia,128,563â€“568
1863ec946de33cda46a81b1176674a413397e8fb,Reduced fronto-callosal fiber integrity in unmedicated OCD patients: a diffusion tractography study.,"It is widely accepted that abnormalities in the frontal area of the brain underpin the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Fundamental to this investigation is the delineation of frontal white matter tracts including dorsal and ventral frontal projections of interhemispheric connections. While previous investigations of OCD have examined the dorsal and ventral frontal regions, the corresponding callosal connections have not been investigated, despite their importance. We recruited twenty patients with OCD (15 drug-naÃ¯ve and 5 currently unmedicated) and demographically similar healthy controls, and conducted fiber tractography and post hoc quantitative analysis using diffusion tensor imaging. We extracted fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fronto-callosal fibers along the entire length of the tract. Function-specific [by the Brodmann area region-of-interest (ROI) approach] and region-specific (by the length-parameterization approach) tracts were defined. In addition, we devised a new index of dorsal-ventral imbalance (DVII) of fiber integrity. Significant FA decreases were observed in orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal projections of the corpus callosum (P < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected) with higher function/region sensitivity than voxel-based or ROI-based approaches. Importantly, OCD patients also exhibited significantly higher ventral-greater-than-dorsal asymmetry of FA values than normal controls (P < 0.05, FDR-corrected). This study is the first to investigate fiber integrity in the dorsal/ventral frontal parts of the callosal tractography in unmedicated OCD patients. Using a more quantitative method in terms of functional and regional specificity than previous studies, we report abnormalities in interhemispheric connectivity of both dorsal and ventral networks in the pathophysiology of OCD.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jungsu S.

6bb0bb7255a665f821637860d80f36f975b488ee,Methods for high dimensional inferences with applications in genomics,"METHODS FOR HIGH DIMENSIONAL INFERENCES WITH APPLICATIONS IN GENOMICS Jichun Xie T. Tony Cai, Hongzhe Li In this dissertation, I have developed several high dimensional inferences and computational methods motivated by problems in genomics studies. It consists of two parts. The first part is motivated by analysis of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where I have developed an optimal false discovery rate (fdr) controlling method for high dimensional dependent data. For short-ranged dependent data, I have shown that the marginal plug-in procedure has the optimal property in controlling the fdr and minimizing the false non-discovery rate (fnr). When applied to analysis of the neuroblastoma GWAS data, this procedure identified six more disease-associated variants compared to previous p-value based procedures such as the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure. I have further investigated the statistical issue of sparse signal recovery in the setting of GWAS and developed a rigorous procedure for sample size and power analysis in the framework of fdr and fnr for GWAS. In addition, I have characterized the almost complete discovery boundary in terms of signal strength and non-null proportion and developed a procedure to achieve the almost complete recovery of the signals. The second part of my dissertation was motivated by gene regulation network construction based on the genetical genomics data iv (eQTL). I have developed a sparse high dimensional multivariate regression model for studying the conditional independent relationships among a set of genes adjusting for possible genetic effects, as well as the genetic architecture that influences the gene expression. I have developed a covariate adjusted precision matrix estimation method (capme), which can be easily implemented by linear programming. Asymptotic convergence rates and sign consistency are established for the estimators of the regression coefficients and the precision matrix. Numerical performance of the estimator was investigated using both simulated and real data sets. Simulation results have shown that the capme resulted in great improvements in both estimation and graph structure selection. I have applied the capme to analysis of a yeast eQTL data in order to identify the gene regulatory network among a set of genes in the MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, I have also made the R software package capme based on my dissertation work.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Jichun Xie"", ids = ""4999927"")",,80c74a0e0dbe2eef154151370a81bbd4cde0007c; ef5d4979a2234857084099bf3894901c331c330f; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; 3cd4a9cdb14b3add799115519e8c617491d675ed; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; a03106ea6708bfb9d4159565ab88837b42cebc5d; d62b00073b783266cc75150c3e3c53c7f9784b81; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; eba49f4e6256f44fb6a2fab5ee95519e9a9fb49f; ebea418b4a95d32c7d240fdccde466585ab17841; d83f37659d418a915c0b06def402bd0c32ae0ca8; a880ff247a5b5f697058f838b6638b3a6ed6fee2; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; 64af617824b16a3424f9674e3950c288d997ff21; 88522794b5d100aed6b10db1c80d9bf6315fecfb; 46ccf2382364f95e4d51bc0b858b09a990222c9a; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; ac0cd0ba89d33a3c05e81624c686f9b425c70b86; b4d4addb1132bdb9cab3e91a22ce6cfde6c5c32c; a9082bbfcc2b4374f4367d47e14ed76d73cf4d70; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; e584de769fd8693652736182e3a8d099e659e788; a981e0b7b52b50c73281a3eec1f8c86b40f1e4b8; 9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; ca6cb62691d734dc2940b7e332dcf7db1eacfd25; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 84e2bc8d491239a36bdcbc0e636b90b1055e6e54; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 1d7ad0a7ae64bd8d78d09d03ca181e6e579bd6d8; 53adfe99b4cc9c2a1a115de2832d9ead672ab94d; 6f24b15fb3ef4cba014a0e5bbe68937226ad4814; e88ff432d63f5d0a11916e5dc5048a5fc0951587; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4dca768b433f167c3de72d625df3ca73c92614a6; 20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; 6d9c757eb3cff9b177bd99446b3ff1442c654d9d; 2b1e7ef69cf6319cf98be8bdd401f52413b736f8; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 6bbb79cc026ecca4264d95c4551fc58205b09533; 31c88a88c9603ec32b237128dec6feeb5713a5d5; 9e26c8be21f341102016fa5a67b06db362bf272a; ca68550e865cdb68a335d3329d57653da646578d; 564102661e86c44ff4cdb696ff64454c08a253ef; b211079aac55cd6ddb136e4f37b4f90f2ccefda4; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; a8d4eb024b07858b9f030debcfce99eae2fb5f5e; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 50b6a37dea80346593c2539245da25291c3678b0; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 94c85e601786240383a5afeb62be45dc7938e653; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06,,,

It can be valuable to control not the mean of this false discovery proportion (FDP), but rather the probability that the FDP exceeds a specified bound. In this article we construct a general class of methods for exceedance control of FDP based on inverting tests of uniformity.

Fan, Han and Gu have found one. They have achieved this by both clarifying the concept of the problem and providing a feasible algorithmic solution. In this comment, I discuss some of the central concepts involving FDP and its estimation via conditioning in contrast with the estimators by Efron (2007) and Friguet et al.

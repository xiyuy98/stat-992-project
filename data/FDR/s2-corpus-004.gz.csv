The genetic profile as determined by microarray is considered to be an ideal marker of the individual radiosensitivity. However, it is still an open question, whether this profile has to be determined prior to or only after irradiation, since the expression of some genes is affected by irradiation. These changes are induced mainly due to a p53-dependent transactivation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this study gene expression profiles were measured for 3 lymphoblastoid cell lines differing in p53 status (p53 wt: TK6; p53null: TK6E6, p53mut: WTK1) measured either prior to or 3h after exposure to 2Gy. The gene expression profile was determined using the Affymetrix Human HG U133A GeneChip and for selective genes, variation in gene expression was validated by qRT-PCR. In addition, different assays were used to characterize the radioresponse of these three strains.


RESULTS
The three strains were found to be different in all aspects of radiosensitivity studied. Cells with p53wt showed more apoptosis, slightly stronger arrest in G1, but less lethal aberrations and a lower viability when compared to cells with mutated p53, whereas cells absent in p53 are characterized by an intermediate response. The gene expression profile measured prior to irradiation already revealed huge differences. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) identified 141 genes that changed expression twofold or more with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5.4%. When compared to p53null cell line with p53wt showed a twofold difference in up- or down-regulation in 28 genes. A much higher variation was even found when p53mut cells were compared with p53null cells with a twofold difference in even 123 genes. The respective genes were found to be involved mainly in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, metabolisms and signalling but with only one gene relevant for DNA repair. Radiation was found to affect this profile solely for cells with p53wt with a twofold significant up-regulation in only five genes. For selective genes (BCL2, CASP1, CCND2, DDB2, XPC, RAD51C, SESN1, FUCA1, CDKN1A, MDM2, XPC) array data were confirmed by qRT-PCR.


CONCLUSION
The result, that the gene expression profile of lymphoblastoid cells differing in p53 status already displayed clear differences when measured prior to irradiation with only few changes after irradiation, which are solely seen for p53wt cells, suggests, that the differences in radiosensitivity observed for these cells are primarily determined by the variation in expression profile present already prior to irradiation.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Oliver Zschenker"", ids = ""8277572""); list(name = ""Kerstin Borgmann"", ids = ""3899363""); list(name = ""Thomas Streichert"", ids = ""4441055""); list(name = ""Ingo Dunya Meier"", ids = ""3072749""); list(name = ""Agnieszka Wrona"", ids = ""11554368""); list(name = ""Ekkehard Dikomey"", ids = ""6345354"")",3d8565ced1b91cc08259bf0335259666e87c0099; cba09804e5b4e564963ad7d068360720bff35c91; fa04435835877f025272d3ec525b5c5fb816582b; b85d962abeba06706b8e2044ae818fb6599f5f75; 915bbff5bc2592fbc21260df6e09d839a0fc474b; 2667204dc2567e679995098e6a9d4ca0af451a20; fdbefe8dcf54e3992222b91539e5aae0779ec745; c0dab9900597dfb899b81827b4918d12da562ed9; 60d3d5bde5185507b439047459d79e88c737dac5; 745f033f52200e4f0f76b384a3dcd54974d9f9e5; d7ed20ab4fce05bb23bc03f1a16573a83f983e4e; ab6f2890e6d419b45bf8b17d3f872ebcb54294f8; 15d599ead2c356918c5c574f555d514a4b162328; 50ec523fac17b68d3835a3c5e7e9d4021f27fd0d; 5632bf47a6e9913b7eb88f70d595baa1383bd19f; 5eed319b4dcda364ffacd77732e568ce9fdc5e90,,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,80 2,"

5460eabd6725135c8d77d3f973168bf68e879fb5,Evaluation of diagnostics for hierarchical spatial statistical models,"In the twenty-first century, we are able to build large, complex statistical models that are very much like the scientific processes they represent. We use diagnostics to highlight inadequacies in the statistical model, and because of the complexity many different diagnostics are needed. This is analogous to the process of diagnosis in the medical field, where a suite of diagnostics is used to assess the health of a patient. This chapter is focussed on evaluating model diagnostics. In the medical literature a structured approach to diagnostic evaluation is used, based on measurable outcomes such as Sensitivity, Specificity, ROC curves, and False Discovery Rate. We suggest using the same framework to evaluate model diagnostics for hierarchical spatial statistical models; we note that the concepts are the same in the non-spatial and non-hierarchical setting, although the specific proposals given in this chapter may be difficult to generalize.

Since the genes are not generally independent or even marginally identically distributed, model flexibility is an essential task regardless of dependent structures among genes. In this respect, incorporating a version of the Chen-Stein theorem, two-stage procedure has been considered; it seems to have better average power without much elevation of false discovery rate compared to single-stage procedure. Simulation studies and applications in microarray data models are also stressed with the methodological developments.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joonsung Kang"", ids = ""31297656"")",,,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,49,894 - 908
926d073a385e1e464654b512a010e40585f09bfd,Association of six genetic variants with myocardial infarction.,"Although various genes that confer susceptibility to myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified for Caucasian populations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genetic variants related to this condition in Japanese individuals have not been identified definitively. The aim of the present study was to examine an association of MI in Japanese individuals with 29 polymorphisms identified as susceptibility loci for MI or coronary artery disease in Caucasian populations by meta-analyses of GWAS. The study subjects comprised 1,824 subjects with MI and 2,329 controls. Genotypes of the polymorphisms were determined by Luminex bead-based multiplex assay. To compensate for multiple comparisons, we adopted the criterion of a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 for statistical significance for association. Comparisons of allele frequencies by the Ï‡(2) test revealed that rs9369640 of the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1, FDR=0.0007), rs4977574 of the CDKN2B antisense RNA 1 gene (CDKN2B-AS1, FDR=0.0038), rs264 of the lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL, FDR=0.0061), rs599839 of the proline/serine-rich coiled-coil 1 gene (PSRC1, FDR=0.0118), rs9319428 of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 gene (FLT1, FDR=0.0118) and rs12413409 of the cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 2 gene (CNNM2, FDR=0.0300) were significantly associated with MI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that rs9369640 (P=0.0005; odds ratio, 0.89), rs4977574 (P=0.0001; odds ratio, 1.50), rs264 (P=0.0405; odds ratio, 0.85), rs599839 (P=0.0003; odds ratio, 0.68), rs9319428 (P=0.0155; odds ratio, 1.20) and rs12413409 (P=0.0076; odds ratio, 0.66) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with MI.

defa72c8d7f04184c39e5675eca8b0a212c8a734,Cognitive Training Reorganizes Network Modularity in Traumatic Brain Injury,"Background. Graph-theoretic approaches are increasingly popular for identifying the patterns of disrupted neural systems after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the patterns of neuroplasticity in brain organization after cognitive training in TBI are less well understood. Objective. We identified the patterns of training-induced neuroplasticity of the whole-brain network in TBI, using resting-state functional connectivity and graph theory. Methods. A total of 64 civilians and veterans with TBI were randomized into either a strategy-based cognitive training group (n = 33) or a knowledge-based training group (active control group; n = 31) for 8 weeks. The participants experienced mild to severe TBI without focal damage and persistent cognitive dysfunctions. A subset of participants complained of subclinical but residual psychiatric symptoms. We acquired their resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before training, immediately posttraining, and 3 months posttraining. From participantsâ€™ resting-state networks, we obtained the modularity, participation coefficient, within-module connectivity, global efficiency, and local efficiency over multiple network densities. We next performed longitudinal analyses on those measures corrected for multiple comparisons across network densities using false discovery rate (FDR). Results. Relative to the knowledge-based training group, the strategy-based cognitive training group had reduced modularity and increased participation coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency over time (Pnodal < .05; qFDR < 0.05). Brain behavior analysis revealed that the participation coefficient and global efficiency within the strategy-based cognitive training group correlated with trail-making scores in the context of training (Pnodal < .05; qFDR < 0.05). Conclusions. Cognitive training reorganized modular networks in TBI over the whole brain.

sparlich in OpenStreetMap erfasst, was somit zu nicht optimal geplanten Routen fuhrt. 
Um dem entgegen zu wirken, befasst sich dieses Projekt mit der automatischen Erkennung von Fussgangerstreifen auf Orthofotos (Satellitenbildern). Dabei entstand eine hoch skalierbare Applikation, die gelbe Fussgangerstreifen entlang von Strassen ï¬ndet und ihre Koordinaten extrahiert. Die Erkennung erfolgt durch ein Convolutional Neural Network, welches im Bereich des Deep Learnings angesiedelt ist. Es wurde eine Erkennungsrate von uber 80% der visuell sichtbaren Fussgangerstreifen mit einer Fehlerrate von weniger als 10% erreicht. Dieser Prozess konnte mit Hilfe eines Queueing Systems auf eine grosse Anzahl von Computern verteilt werden, was die Verarbeitung so vieler Daten in angemessener Zeit uberhaupt erst ermoglicht. Die Koordinaten der Fussgangerstreifen wurden im Anschluss an das Crowdsourcing-System MapRoulette ubergeben. Auf diesem Weg konnten die Daten in OpenStreetMap integriert werden und zur Verbesserung der Fussgangernavigation ihren Anteil beitragen. 
Es ist moglich diese Losung so auszubauen, dass der Erkennungsalgorithums auf weitere Objekte 
angewendet werden kann.

Crosswalks are an essential part of pedestrian navigation. Unfortunately, they are recorded only sparsely in OpenStreetMap. This leads to non-optimal routes. 
To counteract this problem, the topic of this poject is to automate the process of ï¬nding crosswalks on orthophotos (satellite images). The result is a highly scalable application which ï¬nds yellow crosswalks along streets and extracts their coordinates. The recognition is implemented with a convolutional neural network that is located in the area of deep learning. It has achieved a recognition rate of over 80% with a false discovery rate of less than 10%. This process could be shared on a large number of computer by using a queuing system that makes the processing of so much data possible. After that, the coordinates were added to the crowdsourcing system MapRoulette. With this solution the coordinates of the crosswalks can be integrated in openstreetmap to help improve pedestrian navigation. 
It is possible to expand this solution so that the the algorithm can be applied to other objects.

While tumor grade/proliferation is one major determinant of chemosensitivity in TNBC, we have recently suggested additional (molecular) features to have a significant impact as well. Material and Methods: Differential gene expression analysis was performed between TNBC (n=27) versus non-TNBC (n=106) using gene expression profiles (Affymetrix U133A) from breast cancers of patients treated with neoadjuvant taxane/anthracycline chemotherapy at MDACC (Hess et al. 2006). Differentially expressed genes were validated using profiles of 286 patients with breast cancer who did not receive systemic therapy (Wang et al. 2006). Genes were tested for (a) an association with relapse free survival, (b) an association with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and (c) correlation with Ki67 expression. siRNA knockdown experiments using triple negative and non-triple negative cell lines were carried out using both (a) a proliferation assay and (b) a chemosensitivity assay. Results: The secreted frizzled receptor protein 1 (sFRP-1), a member of the wnt-pathway, was identified as the top differentially overexpressed gene in TNBC (i.e. false discovery rate [FDR] Conclusion: We suggest sFRP-1 as a novel marker of (a) the triple negative breast cancer phenotype in general and (b) its chemosensitivity to taxane-containing chemotherapy independent of Ki67 expression. Preliminary siRNA-based cell culture experiments suggest sFRP-1 to play a causal role with regard to chemosensitivity of TNBC rather than solely constituting a novel marker thereof.

During aging, numerous biochemical and molecular changes occur in cells, including increased DNA instability, epigenetic alterations, cell-signaling disruptions, decreased protein synthesis, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production capacity, and diminished oxidative phosphorylation. Objectives To identify the types of exercise and the molecular mechanisms associated with antiaging phenotypes by comparing the profiles of gene expression in skeletal muscle after various types of exercise and aging. Methods We used bioinformatics data from skeletal muscles reported in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository and used Connection Up- and Down-Regulation Expression Analysis of Microarrays to identify genes significant in antiaging. The significant genes were mapped to molecular pathways and reviewed for their molecular functions, and their associations with molecular and cellular phenotypes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes informatics resources, and GeneCards databases, respectively. Results The results showed that endurance exercise has an antiaging potential (Pearson Ï‡2, P < 0.01) by upregulating genes coding for components of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (Benjamini false discovery rate Q < 0.05). We found that numerous genes coding for components of other pathways were also upregulated (Pearson Ï‡2 P < 0.01) as a chronic adaptation to endurance exercise, including ATP5C1, involved in ATP synthesis, CYCS, involved in electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and GSTK1, involved in cellular detoxification. Conclusions Endurance exercise may be the best type to promote antiaging phenotypes by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production capacity.",2015,,"list(name = ""Wasin Laohavinij"", ids = ""88408780""); list(name = ""Apiwat Mutirangura"", ids = ""2770280"")",,505a0f342fc73fde0f71ac27cf97b88431c81d04; 517e07d1f4317a21d7fb85b2413f8bc455223a59; 97a9b786bf04f2e14e54c25008863fe7c90ff88b; ccf7180c6d35ed2428e1ed39508e49bda5a09200; 1b95755bacba89f7293a863d0a5d8e255662b317; a60b50e4a66a2999d6300a6d452c6130809983f4; 37434ca82c9311e744cd3cc86ed14eae4a85c194; 76d4e7ff153205e20da16cedc8972cc23b24a47f; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; 3026a272893e125baf41849139a95bac8e31782f; dc145e355452e2d6b88a821787f8dc42438fe70c; 579f2b5cbebbf325fd86ff9cfd62fceddd8e1ced; 5178f1375f1ac472f4d58ad5b7024ce449391b0d; aead8caa4b6bf72681153bf3dc06275748b3e6b2; 3a9073bc5acbafe68f0caf1fa1afdb23675c6ab0; 7261469291ba8a9fecf4c1f4f577a555fe01a708; d00d060635f39151600b6ff69793f2742f6603fa; 652b3ad7c7db881566769a392353b07971286247; 424c3d2caf920649b39c2126493feffe2583eb75; 4830353bd116a6f88efe3f7f9e5300d077e216b5; 98c12296799941e9a70aafcff0d10410a9af9cca; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 8a24afdd0ed6cfbba194d64751887239a73ad408; cec9938577000ab0a49223a7a3e19578467ab913; f9719c4e10fb85a4165a5c4fd738349f3f0a5ce5; 3b6cf6f5a365fae972a7830338d2986d342bdc5e; 3a09814039dc1b8ed55a4c54f8425b18b26b7abd; 5f119a84c3d785bba6833c5f5d155eec88210ec1; acccf1ab96ba4b82bf520c9c1633e1ac016b6eaa; 3042383a4ab71a0466a8ecf0719adb51d9ed4ecb; f897ba5be7d6d73e25465423a8c070619fc1dce1; b3cf8b7722d78a3160c4e3a8bd419c9d15c81af4; 70e59c36d30045177f8dcaa7af0bc844b880b429,Asian Biomedicine,9,455 - 471
de066d0d69775b9cf59f06b587e3f299eb36822c,Potential functional variants in SMC2 and TP53 in the AURORA pathway genes and risk of pancreatic cancer.,"The AURORA pathway participates in mitosis and cell division, and alterations in mitosis and cell division can lead to carcinogenesis. Therefore, genetic variants in the AURORA pathway genes may be associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. To test this hypothesis, we used three large publically available pancreatic cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets (PanScan I, II/III and PanC4) to assess the associations of 7168 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a set of 62 genes of this pathway with pancreatic cancer risk in 8477 cases and 6946 controls of European ancestry. We identify 15 significant pancreatic cancer risk-associated SNPs in three genes (SMC2, ARHGEF7 and TP53) after correction for multiple comparisons by a false discovery rate < 0.20. Through further linkage disequilibrium analysis, SNP functional prediction and stepwise logistic regression analysis, we focused on three SNPs: rs3818626 in SMC2, rs79447092 in ARHGEF7 and rs9895829 in TP53. We found that these three SNPs were associated with pancreatic cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.17 and P = 2.20E-06 for the rs3818626 C allele; OR = 0.76, CI = 0.66-0.88 and P = 1.46E-04 for the rs79447092 A allele and OR = 0.82, CI = 0.74-0.91 and P = 1.51E-04 for the rs9895829 G allele]. Their joint effect as the number of protective genotypes also showed a significant association with pancreatic cancer risk (trend test P â‰¤ 0.001). Finally, we performed an expression quantitative trait loci analysis and found that rs3818626 and rs9895829 were significantly associated with SMC2 and TP53 messenger RNA expression levels in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines, respectively. In conclusion, these three representative SNPs may be potentially susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer and warrant additional validation.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yun Feng"", ids = ""48260287""); list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Bensong Duan"", ids = ""38353792""); list(name = ""Zhensheng Liu"", ids = ""9071783""); list(name = ""James L Abbruzzese"", ids = ""5192828""); list(name = ""Kyle M Walsh"", ids = ""2196573""); list(name = ""Xuefeng Zhang"", ids = ""32968207""); list(name = ""Qingyi Wei"", ids = ""144131026"")",68ce181221bbd6dfa02a99d2652ec14c773e6cd3,,Carcinogenesis,40 4,"

6f5aff7142692efa58d7780ee2b297b70def6bf3,A family-based study of gene variants and maternal folate and choline in neuroblastoma: a report from the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group,"PurposeNeuroblastoma is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system with embryonic origins. Previous epidemiologic studies suggest maternal vitamin supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of neuroblastoma. We hypothesized offspring and maternal genetic variants in folate-related and choline-related genes are associated with neuroblastoma and modify the effects of maternal intake of folate, choline, and folic acid.MethodsThe Neuroblastoma Epidemiology in North America (NENA) study recruited 563 affected children and their parents through the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Groupâ€™s Childhood Cancer Research Network. We used questionnaires to ascertain pre-pregnancy supplementation and estimate usual maternal dietary intake of folate, choline, and folic acid. We genotyped 955 genetic variants related to folate or choline using DNA extracted from saliva samples and used a log-linear model to estimate both child and maternal risk ratios and stratum-specific risk ratios for geneâ€“environment interactions.ResultsOverall, no maternal or offspring genotypic results met criteria for a false discovery rate (FDR) Q-valueÂ <0.2. Associations were also null for geneâ€“environment interaction with pre-pregnancy vitamin supplementation, dietary folic acid, and folate. FDR-significant geneâ€“choline interactions were found for offspring SNPs rs10489810 and rs9966612 located in MTHFD1L and TYMS, respectively, with maternal choline dietary intake dichotomized at the first quartile.ConclusionThese results suggest that variants related to one-carbon metabolism are not strongly associated with neuroblastoma.

281903b9e181883744762b2b8f08cd04d6798f99,"Fourier Analysis of Functional Time Series, with Applications to DNA Dynamics","This work is about time series of functional data (functional time series), and consists of three main parts. In the first part (Chapter 2), we develop a doubly spectral decomposition for functional time series that generalizes the Karhunenâ€“Loeve expansion. In the second part (Chapter 3), we develop the theory of estimation for the spectral density operators, which are the main tool involved in the doubly spectral decomposition. The third part (Chapter 4) is concerned with the problem of understanding and comparing the dynamics of DNA. It proposes a methodology for comparing the dynamics of DNA minicircles that are vibrating in solution, using tools developed in this thesis. In the first part, we develop a doubly spectral representation of a stationary functional time series that generalizes the Karhunenâ€“Loeve expansion to the functional time series setting. The representation decomposes the time series into an integral of uncorrelated frequency components (Cramer representation), each of which is in turn expanded in a Karhunen-Loeve series, thus yielding a Cramerâ€“Karhunenâ€“Loeve decomposition of the series. The construction is based on the spectral density operatorsâ€”whose Fourier coefficients are the lag-t autocovariance operatorsâ€”which characterise the second-order dynamics of the process. The spectral density operators are the functional analogues of the spectral density matrices, whose eigenvalues and eigenfunctions at different frequencies provide the building blocks of the representation. By truncating the representation at a finite level, we obtain a harmonic principal component analysis of the time series, an optimal finite dimensional reduction of the time series that captures both the temporal dynamics of the process, and the within-curve dynamics, and dominates functional PCA. The proofs rely on the construction of a stochastic integral of operator-valued functions, whose construction is similar to that of the Ito integral. In practice, the spectral density operators are unknown. In the second part, we therefore develop the basic theory of a frequency domain framework for drawing statistical inferences on the spectral density operators of a stationary functional time series. Our main tool is the functional Discrete Fourier Transform(fDFT).We derive an asymptotic Gaussian representation of the fDFT, thus allowing the transformation of the original collection of dependent random functions into a collection of approximately independent complex-valued Gaussian random functions. Our results are then employed in order to construct estimators of the spectral density operators based on smoothed versions of the periodogram kernel, the functional generalisation of the periodogram matrix. The consistency and asymptotic law of these estimators are studied in detail. As immediate consequences, we obtain central limit theorems for the mean and the long-run covariance operator of a stationary functional time series. Our results do not depend on structural modeling assumptions, but only functional versions of classical cumulant mixing conditions. The effect of discrete noisy observations on the consistency of the estimators is studied in a framework general enough to apply to a wide range of smoothing techniques for converting discrete noisy observations into functional data. We also perform a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of our estimators, and give a discussion of the technical assumptions of our results, and at what cost our weak dependence assumptions could be changed or weakened, and provide examples of processes satisfying the technical assumptions of our asymptotic results. As an application, we consider in the third part the problem of comparing the dynamics of the trajectories of two DNA minicircles that are vibrating in solution, which are obtained via Molecular Dynamics simulations. The approach we take is to view and compare the dynamics through their spectral density operators, which contain the entire second-order structure of the trajectories. As a first step, we compare the spectral density operators of the two DNA minicircles using a new test we develop, which allows us to compare the spectral density operators at a fixed frequencies. Using multiple testing procedures, we are able to localize in frequencies the differences in spectral density operators of the two DNA minicircles, while controlling a type-I error, and conduct numerical simulations to assess the performance of our method. We further investigate the differences between the two minicircles by comparing their spectral density operators within frequencies. This allows us to localize their differences both in frequencies and on the minicircles, while controlling the averaged false discovery rate over the selected frequencies. Our methodology is general enough to be applied to the comparison of the dynamics of any pair of stationary functional time series.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shahin Tavakoli"", ids = ""67246709"")",d543e23248cf1d1a72fcc1ab30af39916f8a749f; 44c5e910ac40c4448f68f970f2fc09f89ca3305a,,,,
bed8aa6c3ad8dff41a825e1f66984291ad66477c,Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal,"Summary form only given. Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal can involve a large number of hypotheses. For instance, two satellite images of the same scene, taken before and after an event, could be used to test a hypothesis that the event has no environmental impact. This is equivalent to testing that the mean difference of ""after-before"" is zero at each of the (typically thousands of) pixels that make up the scene. In such a situation, conventional testing procedures that control the overall Type I error deteriorate as the number of hypotheses increase. Powerful testing procedures are needed for this problem of testing for the presence of a spatial signal. In this talk, we propose a procedure called enhanced FDR (EFDR), which is based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and a concept known as generalized degrees of freedom (GDF). EFDR differs from the standard FDR procedure through its reducing of the number of hypotheses tested. This is done in two ways: first, the model is represented more parsimoniously in the wavelet domain, and second, an optimal selection of hypotheses is made using a criterion based on generalized degrees of freedom. Not only does the EFDR procedure tell us whether a spatial signal is present or not, it has an added bonus that, if a signal is deemed present, it can indicate its location and magnitude. The EFDR procedure is applied to an air-temperature data set generated from the climate system model (CSM) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and to brain-imaging data from fMRI experiments.",2003,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Noel A Cressie"", ids = ""48393332"")",75396a2915d929d56f01fbb6c787783a8b84f3b3; 08e9d012c99da90c76f92cd0ad1ebea477338c5f; 8d98ce43d00dedc463f13702d0c468dafa428686; 26d0b390ece41a7b571e073770c8c428ae21f924; 6a379e0d8804cfa4514813a6e81b279b730b850e; 3f2a16742a2065b24b138b8973aae43c78fd8716; b2599fab8d74d6f3f91c30abe631763b5668ffcf; 697d48591a6e0fe5c942d0bdd5154fd1c3f28a57; 44eb5c972c9f10df3fa0bab0fb945e878f4bcfad; 28d170daa41568b856667cc833a913f88d1b0769; 834af618512b1987a61120337ea1f2adf24f0c60; 816e0ec66c67cb78e258b0644752c31a4d30e210; 253b7acb270a50a61ff0845c9094abed143f2d67; e9d5de683cdee9ede1654a8225117345345d9cb1; 7a911554a5294ef43759e9759417313d859d6d92; 9887010d41b0bb67c893c8aeb22589ef4a5d1b1d; 3dfe507ba98116a95610bf8861f1a6477beef447; eb4de84ebab4df1d63c8982ef889eba81135ea5b; 3aa8924a93e17ca20af42be7a57059f39ace78ac; cb5790ceacac7c3f3b55794ba52cd2248b72d4b9; 977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 5460eabd6725135c8d77d3f973168bf68e879fb5; 3c0beca1f5e9938c8cbd0fd8750ea26a0d7c8745; f850614de09c084b9f71206500218ac3b1c2d0df; 806be313fb9d8e1de381c563864918ed11720a58; 7060459e8628e19dae8bf3f065639e72d613fa50; a69d82782cd503181fff61a4b263f959a281e02b; fc57dfcd17326dcfb2b2841235faecd4c6cd23ed; d409e584067c8f370ef00c911715cf1bc32978c3; d3b692174dbedac40ec08517abc9f1e36018fa0a; b04096c0f77ddba2c694d5c03e6d83de9acab54c; c81b06942f95ed8ce12f0c8275a6cb2daadff835; a7eb122f31e3b95135b6ee0ed7a85c1b33948d0e; ca15d30e7fedf2f3f8d95241757f008d834a7f86; 290d6b7182ac4cc71d90bfc35daaf3c03776fdfa; 44725582101f44482614e8ec09afe93265ba01cd; bd946c8b7b89eb35b88ad22096315deb041d694d; 5d4e9f9ac6253bd226e64058fa252da92eed85af; 2264f7a565b81166baa4c4a049d973688b3f0127; 16f1cf3410ac7295d3971ff6fe63e4de9232cd8b; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; 0407e392370fba31e7ce96d99b08a0cf0911382e; 2bfeb6a9f0717031295bbb98ddc976e32adf1b33; f844c1430d18d4a602a554b8d412bb7f8feb29f1; 0ce82385d11dadb50c9a0e564a51ce1f406fdd90; 94d9758bf708d9790502de6f10ec69f2f3a9db5c; 1f999c452d00794442472ec6f5e27117edef157f; 13d56d23d1dfd6b3217e71827ee501a58b162176; 21f5b9bc7f53246071df62379c884b37b3280f59,,"IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, 2003",,3-

The aim of the study was to investigate whether PCA performed better at identifying associations between diet and disease than an analysis of each individual food in the FFQ separately after adjusting for multiple testing, a process we refer to as exhaustive single food analysis (ESFA). Methods Using simulated data employing a known model for the associations between food intakes and disease, and a realistic joint distribution of food intakes, we investigated the performance of PCA and ESFA in correctly identifying associations between diet and disease. Performance was assessed in terms of the power with which we could identify at least one association between a food intake and disease, and the power and false discovery rate (FDR) for identifying specific food intakes that were causally linked to disease in the model. Results ESFA had greater power than PCA to detect an association of at least one food with disease, and greater power and lower FDR for identifying specific foods causally linked to disease. With both methods FDRs increased with sample size, even using an FDR-controlling adjustment. However, when we adjusted the ESFA for foods that were significant in univariate analyses, FDRs were controlled at the specified level. Conclusions An exhaustive analysis of single foods out-performed PCA in identifying associations between diet and disease using FFQ data.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ioannis Bakolis"", ids = ""6795674""); list(name = ""Richard Hooper"", ids = ""47827439""); list(name = ""Peter Burney"", ids = ""145721549""); list(name = ""Salma Shaheen"", ids = ""11420426"")",,,Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health,65,

This case-control study aimed to analyze the differences of variant carrier frequencies between cases and controls, and to explain the possible genetic effects on the progression of TVD. A total of 8943 TVD patients were consecutively enrolled. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) included all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, readmission and stroke. Patients with 1-year MACCE in this cohort were selected as MACCE group. Blood samples from MACCE group and non-CAD control groups were collected, and a deoxyribonucleic acid library was created. A total of 34 tag or hot single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes including CDKN2B-AS1, ADAMTS7, ABO, ADAMTS13, IL-18, and PECAM1 were analyzed by a SNPscanâ„¢ multi-genotyping kit. Carrier frequencies of each SNP were compared between the two groups using dominant, recessive and codominant allele model, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression model was established. Variant allele frequencies of rs10757274, rs1333042, rs1333049, rs4977574, rs9632884, rs1063192 and rs3217986 on CDKN2B-AS1 gene showed significant differences between the two groups in at least one allele model. Variant allele frequency of rs3217986 was not statistically significant after adjusting for the false discovery rate using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Qâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Variant allele frequencies of rs1333049, rs10757274, rs4977574 on CDKN2B-AS1 gene were significantly higher in MACCE group in all dominant, recessive and codominant models. Rs1055432 on ADAMTS13 and rs8176694 on ABO gene showed threshold significance between the two groups.

af2b77e3f200e959082c621041cce61621288a48,Serological Biomarkers of Fibrostenotic Crohnâ€™s Disease,"BACKGROUND:Â  Crohnâ€™s Disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease mainly affecting the terminal ileum (TI) with three distinct behavioural phenotypes, including strictures (B2). Despite improved understanding of its mechanisms, fibrostenotic strictures remain a therapeutic challenge as there are no intestinal specific anti- fibrotic medications.Â  Strictures are diagnosed using diagnostic imaging (intestinal ultrasound; IUS) and contain (1) luminal narrowing, (2) increased wall thickness, (3) prestenotic dilation. Currently, there are no biomarkers to differentiate stricturing CD from other phenotypes. Studies have shown that protein profiling may distinguish CD subtypes. Utilizing IUS which readily identifies CD strictures, the serum of patients with and without strictures was analyzed for a unique protein signature.Â  
METHODS: In this prospective study, patients meeting inclusion criteria from the University of Calgary Inflammatory Bowel Disease Outpatient Clinic, and Endoscopy Suite between May and August 2019 were enrolled. 28 CD patients (17 male, 17 female) with ileal strictures were matched with a group of 28 patients with ileal inflammatory disease (14 male, 14 female) as confirmed by IUS and Shear Wave Elastography. 4 mL of patient blood was collected and centrifugation was used to prepare sera stored at -80Â° for quantitative shotgun proteomic sequencing using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS). Statistical analysis at 1% false discovery rate, was performed to isolate significant differences in proteins between fibrostenotic and inflammatory groups.Â  
RESULTS: Gender and current age were matched between groups during MS. Mean ileal bowel wall thickness was greater in the stricture (7 mm) group than in the inflammatory group (3.14 mm, p = 0.02). In the stricture group, Plexin-A2, BCA-1 and Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietan (TSLP), TNF-Î² and related interleukin proteins were found in significantly higher levels than in patients with inflammatory behaviour. Conversely, a variety of innate immune response proteins such as C-reactive protein, FGG, and VCL were elevated significantly in the inflammatory CD patient group compared to the stricture group. Patients were asked if they were receiving medical therapy, in the form of infusion or capsule, to ensure any medication induced alterations were considered in our analysis of sera proteins. Â  
CONCLUSIONS:Â  The sera of patients with CD strictures have a unique protein profile including TSLP, a known defence mechanism to reduce inflammation, in CD. These results provide further evidence to refine previously published candidate proteins and to validate these potential biomarkers , ultimately to aid in early stricture detection, and prevent progression, and recurrence.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexis Filyk"", ids = ""1584698989""); list(name = ""Cathy Lu"", ids = ""1400121067"")",,,,1,
919fa5c2da07fe442dd8188437b99a677fa47e3c,Jointly determining significance levels of primary and replication studies by controlling the false discovery rate in two-stage genome-wide association studies,"In genome-wide association studies, we normally discover associations between genetic variants and diseases/traits in primary studies, and validate the findings in replication studies. We consider the associations identified in both primary and replication studies as true findings. An important question under this two-stage setting is how to determine significance levels in both studies. In traditional methods, significance levels of the primary and replication studies are determined separately. We argue that the separate determination strategy reduces the power in the overall two-stage study. Therefore, we propose a novel method to determine significance levels jointly. Our method is a reanalysis method that needs summary statistics from both studies. We find the most powerful significance levels when controlling the false discovery rate in the two-stage study. To enjoy the power improvement from the joint determination method, we need to select single nucleotide polymorphisms for replication at a less stringent significance level. This is a common practice in studies designed for discovery purpose. We suggest this practice is also suitable in studies with validation purpose in order to identify more true findings. Simulation experiments show that our method can provide more power than traditional methods and that the false discovery rate is well-controlled. Empirical experiments on datasets of five diseases/traits demonstrate that our method can help identify more associations.

98de6063010d296ff66ab53cbcf9cbe4613fb3ed,Diffusion enhancement model and its application in peak detection,"Abstract It is a challenge for peak detection algorithms to detect some low-amplitude peaks and overlapped peaks contaminated by noise. Among of existing peak detection algorithms, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based algorithm is the best. When the Mexican Hat wavelet is selected as the mother wavelet, the CWT of a signal is essentially equivalent to using the Gaussian function to smooth the 2nd derivative of the signal. Therefore, a natural idea is to combine the peak enhancement step and peak-preserving diffusion into peak detection process to improve the performance of peak detection. In the proposed algorithm, the Gaussian smoothing in the CWT-based algorithm is replaced with the peak-preserving diffusion filtering. As an assessment of the proposed algorithm, a simulated spectrum with low-amplitude peaks and overlapped peaks was generated and used to test the enhancement performance. Then 100 groups of simulated proteomics data sets in [1] were used to assess the proposed algorithm. In these data sets, the true peaks are known in each spectrum. Thus, the false discovery rate (FDR) is easy to find. Five typical peak detection programs were chosen to compare the proposed algorithm. The FDR and sensitivity is employed to compare the performance of these algorithms. Result shows that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of peak detection.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jun Li"", ids = ""46277047""); list(name = ""Yuanlu Li"", ids = ""1685938""); list(name = ""Weijing Zhao"", ids = ""49260706""); list(name = ""Min Jiang"", ids = ""145660343"")",,,Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems,189,130-137

To investigate the iTRAQ-based proteomic changes of visual cycle-associated proteins in RPE of rd12 mice before and after RPE65 gene delivery. Mehtods. The right eyes of rd12 mice underwent RPE65 gene delivery by subretinal injection at P14, leaving the left eyes as control. C57BL/6J mice were served as a wide-type control group. ERGs were recorded at P42, and RPE-choroid-sclera complex was collected to evaluate the proteomic changes in visual cycle-associated proteins by iTRAQ-based analysis. Western blot was used to confirm the changes in the differentially expressed proteins of interest. Results. ERG parameters improved dramatically at P42 after RPE65 delivery. The proteomics analysis identified a total 536 proteins with a global false discovery rate of 0.21%, out of which 7 were visual cycle-associated proteins. RALBP-1, RBP-1, and IRBP were reduced in the untreated rd12 eyes and the former two were improved after gene therapy, confirmed by Western blot analysis. Conclusions. RPE65 gene delivery restored retinal function at P42 and modified the expression of other functional proteins implicated in the visual cycle. The level of RALBP-1 was still below the normal level after gene therapy in rd12 mice, which may explain the delayed dark adaption in LCA patients undergoing similar therapy.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qinxiang Zheng"", ids = ""5320964""); list(name = ""Yueping Ren"", ids = ""6498142""); list(name = ""Radouil T Tzekov"", ids = ""6230510""); list(name = ""Shanshan Hua"", ids = ""50767968""); list(name = ""Mengting Li"", ids = ""8392935""); list(name = ""Jijing Pang"", ids = ""152985276""); list(name = ""Jia Qu"", ids = ""144476350""); list(name = ""Wensheng Li"", ids = ""1746630"")",ab4dd6a5a324cbd7e7f824997b40dd3d030c61d3; bcd7be248e7cf1a9af44a8a976710076f5f4582d,7f091a0ac3ba15e86217f1cf84131e454e1fa3c5; a3b8146c7950597628689d14551e74d46cc3543d; bfc2b0cecf3a96114350f1e0cad00518d145b358; 0eaed63940b81cdb6d8c0972370b6abe48c5e4b3; 13228d4fcb8cf77a3b6b604509e9f60f779c66dd; 523d8aa0aae3239b82a499562c0696118edf67d3; 2a345d0c4692ee2d5d02dfbb420f822fa9f04602; 3e0e337b477e0c226da00eae03fd29882275a469; 327f1e784836bff993359bc069b1203010182f3b; 04ca08a80bcd972baa3ef89441f3749f99e8e0b2; d8daa2f46de22a0bf06ec5174d4fdbc650d4239b; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; fbf863b49e6006c574a284fac47dcca6d7e0dc1c; d75d029520be78b461a784097a251baf543da223; 378bfebb3b046e709ed5dd668afe7666baffd6fd; 0c9268e3503cad0d20b8dc8ebca162e043324832; 2e808f126d933665e89ddf814c00d175057aaee1; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307; 97a0b529bdbc0fb5682cc5a5ae6c578438cae899; 5b8920390a573eea6569f840579b0c66409eb418; 3567c0e52450b6ff63348e6fec55c5c45f6c9607; 950bb724db08b009e6305157ac21b484cd2771fe; fff1b293b45d06c8462021aa6c90c81e743e131b; bdecf943975d5456e72636cc69dec93fea2941e6; 8155baa41afca2fadd6dab4e275798004aa04f61; ac370109bfd15b2ef8fec6848102e2ad3ce8dbb8; 74948c9e2883c790c3d80abb7b68c008ee5f6aa3; 8340231f1febba91fba8475233f57a756bfbaca6; 9591bfa7693931c675893dbe4e3f8ee47b048bbe; 4c009b85d014a40dbb881361f84dcd9a325447d6; 6b91e533e475b7c7b339dde58c822493bc9739ea; 022548569009a45f9d8a8dc35375f5a9da461e0c; 444537108d9171272bfbb0eccd7a3855ada66b0d; 21367fc71d34b960cfeeb74caf168090941a8974; 7b5649ef202dad8b9eb7a5c085bdbc9a02535fed; e72cd7d1fe0fe577f1c0d158f4fe3a548f715798; 82aa20ee30783cd6cfd95e73144ec43d71bf7bc4; 560e6e9c00a89f28eeb611833702a972988993be,Journal of Ophthalmology,2015,

1b7cd1397a09b20c9f89ffbd6204ea245bad0fbf,"How Suitable Are Registry Data for Recurrence Risk Calculations? Validation of Diagnoses on 1,593 Families With Congenital Heart Disease","Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) occurs in approximately 1% of all live births, and 3% to 8% of these have until now been considered familial cases, defined as the occurrence of two or more affected individuals in a family. The validity of CHD diagnoses in Danish administrative registry data has only been studied previously in highly selected patient populations. These studies identified high positive predictive values (PPVs) and recurrence risk ratios (RRRsâ€”ratio between probabilities of CHD given family history of CHD and no family history). However, the RRR can be distorted if registry data are used indiscriminately. Here, we investigated the consequences of misclassifications for the RRR using validated diagnoses on Danish patients with familial CHD. Methods: Danish citizens are assigned a civil registration number (CPR number) at birth or immigration, which acts as a unique identifier in the Danish registries, thus enabling connection of information from several registries. Utilizing the CPR number, we identified Danish patients with familial CHD and reviewed each patientâ€™s file. We compared diagnoses from the registries with those manually assigned, which enabled calculation of the PPVs of diagnoses in the Danish registries, and from this, we deduced the false discovery rate (FDR). To measure the consequences on the RRR, the FDR was applied to a simulated data set with true RRR values of 2 and 10. Results: We validated diagnoses of 2,442 patients from 1,593 families. Of these, 874 patients were misclassified corresponding to an FDR of 36%. Applying this FDR on the simulated data sets, we found that the RRR decreased from 2 and 10 to 1.4 and 5.1, respectively. Lastly, we estimated that 11% of all cases with CHD were familial. Conclusion: We found that approximately one of nine of all cases with CHD are familial, and we also found that 36% of individuals with CHD in administrative medical registries are misclassified, which distort the RRR in simulated scenarios.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sabrina Gade EllesÃ¸e"", ids = ""1398126273""); list(name = ""Anders C.

8a2cc79958dacdb3cd2e38389afef280575b3c13,Su54: a Pilot Methylated Dna Immunoprecipitation Sequencing: Hypermethylation of the Death-associated Protein 3 (dap3) and Mir2110 in Fibromyalgia Associated with Child Abuse History among African American Females,"Background Epigenetics, such as DNA methylation, has been hypothesized as one possible mechanism to explain the association between adverse childhood experiences and later health problems. The goal of this study was to identify genome-wide DNA methylation markers from peripheral blood associated with child abuse history among 6 African American adult females with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) using Methylated DNA Immuno-Precipitation sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). Methods Data were from a fibromyalgia, natural history study approved by the MedStar Health IRB. FMS was diagnosed using the 1990 or the 2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria and the Widespread Pain Index. Pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and cognitive function were assessed. A detailed abuse history was obtained, including age at the time and type of abuse (i.e., emotional, physical, or rape). A total of 6 FMS African American females, including 4 with any abuse before age 18 (Abused FMS female; AbFF) and 2 without (Non-abused FMS female; NFF), were selected in this study. Using peripheral blood collected from the subjectsâ€™ genomic DNA was extracted. DNA fragments containing methylated CpG were enriched and sequenced in the HiSeq-2500 system using MeDIP-Seq. Reads were aligned to the reference human genome of hg38. Generated sam files were sorted according to chromosomal position. Peaks were called using MACS version 2.1.1.20160309, to identify methylated DNA regions. DiffBind software package was used to perform clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and differential peak interval analysis with False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 0.05 cutoff. Results All of the 6 subjects with FMS met both the 1990 and 2010 criteria, except 1 NFF who only met the 1990 criteria. Age ranged from 45 to 56 years (mean=53.5, SD=4.23). The majority (66.7%) did not have a college education, unemployed, or divorced or widowed. Among the 4 AFFs, 1 reported rape + physical abuse, 2 reported rape only, and 1 reported emotional abuse. No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms or characteristics between AbFFs and NFFs. The number of methylated intervals per each subject ranged from 234,842 to 454,508. With the union of all these intervals, we obtained 412,226 methylated intervals, overall. Both of clustering analysis and PCA clearly separated AbFFs and NFFs. The differential analysis with FDR of 0.05 identified 15 intervals hypermethylated for AFPs and another 15 intervals hypermethylated for NFPs. After excluding ambiguous regions to interpret (e.g., repetitive DNA regions such as ribosomal repeating regions, the human alpha satellite repeat region) we identified DAP3 and mir2110 hypermethylated for AbFFs compared to NFFs. Discussion This study suggests hypermethylation in DAP3 and mir2110 could be used as candidates for novel biomarkers associated with child abuse history in African American females with fibromyalgia. Epigenetic inactivation patterns, especially one in DAP3, are found in numerous tumor cells and negatively affect cancer prognosis. Reduced DAP3 expression affects its normal regulation of cell respiration and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress, which is important of cell death pathways related to the ischemia-reperfusion injury. Further study is required to confirm this finding with more clinical samples.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Hyun-Hwa Lee"", ids = ""80315758""); list(name = ""Annette Mullis"", ids = ""88726684""); list(name = ""Sijung Yun"", ids = ""88101746""); list(name = ""Katrina Isla"", ids = ""27978005""); list(name = ""Brian T.

Previously, we have established a mouse congenic strain on C57BL/6Â J background, carrying an obesity quantitative trait locus (QTL), tabw2, derived from obese diabetic TALLYHO/JngJ mice. The tabw2 congenic mice exhibit increased adiposity and hyperleptinemia, which becomes exacerbated upon feeding HFS diets. In this study, we conducted genome-wide gene expression profiling to evaluate differentially expressed genes between tabw2 and control mice fed HFS diets, which may lead to identification of candidate genes as well as insights into the mechanisms underlying obesity mediated by tabw2. Both tabw2 congenic mice and control mice were fed HFS diets for 10Â weeks beginning at 4Â weeks of age, and total RNA was isolated from liver and adipose tissue. Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed and verified by real-time quantitative RTâ€“PCR. At False Discovery Rate adjusted PÂ <Â 0.05, 1026 genes were up-regulated and 308 down-regulated in liver, whereas 393 were up-regulated and 187 down-regulated in adipose tissue in tabw2 congenic mice compared to controls.

afd1a0a9a13804e2c75aab8ab7362d9003ae2315,FDR-Corrected Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis With Applications to Imaging Genomics,"Reducing the number of false discoveries is presently one of the most pressing issues in the life sciences. It is of especially great importance for many applications in neuroimaging and genomics, where data sets are typically high-dimensional, which means that the number of explanatory variables exceeds the sample size. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a criterion that can be employed to address that issue. Thus it has gained great popularity as a tool for testing multiple hypotheses. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a statistical technique that is used to make sense of the cross-correlation of two sets of measurements collected on the same set of samples (e.g., brain imaging and genomic data for the same mental illness patients), and sparse CCA extends the classical method to high-dimensional settings. Here, we propose a way of applying the FDR concept to sparse CCA, and a method to control the FDR. The proposed FDR correction directly influences the sparsity of the solution, adapting it to the unknown true sparsity level. Theoretical derivation as well as simulation studies show that our procedure indeed keeps the FDR of the canonical vectors below a user-specified target level. We apply the proposed method to an imaging genomics data set from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Our results link the brain connectivity profiles derived from brain activity during an emotion identification task, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, to the corresponding subjectsâ€™ genomic data.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Alexej Gossmann"", ids = ""3283777""); list(name = ""Pascal Zille"", ids = ""2682299""); list(name = ""Vince D.

Â Introduction and Aim. TGF-Î² signalling is involved in pathogenesis and progress of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This bioinformatics study consequently aims to determine the underlying molecular mechanism of TGF- Î² activation in HCC cells.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Dataset GSE10393 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 2 Huh-7 (HCC cell line) samples treated by TGF- Î² (100 pmol/L, 48 h) and 2 untreated samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using Limma package (false discovery rate < 0.05 and |log2 fold change| > 1.5), and then enrichment analyses of function, pathway, and disease were performed. In addition, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the PPI data from multiple databases including INACT, MINT, BioGRID, UniProt, BIND, BindingDB, and SPIKE databases. Transcription factor (TF)-DEG pairs (Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.01) from ChEA database and DEG-DEG pairs were used to construct TF-DEG regulatory network. Furthermore, TF-pathway-DEG complex network was constructed by integrating DEG-DEG pairs, TF-DEG pairs, and DEG-pathway pairs.


RESULTS
Totally, 209 DEGs and 30 TFs were identified. The DEGs were significantly enriched in adhesion-related functions. PPI network indicted hub genes such as CUL4B and NEDD4. According to the TF-DEG regulatory network, the two hub genes were targeted by SMAD2, SMAD3, and HNF4A. Besides, the 11 pathways in TF-pathway-DEG network were mainly enriched by UGT1A family and CYP3A7, which were predicted to be regulated by SMAD2, SMAD3, SOX2, TP63, and HNF4A.


CONCLUSIONS
TGF- Î² might influence biological processes of HCC cells via SMAD2/SMAD3-NEDD4, HNF4A-CUL4B/NEDD4, SOX2/TP63/HNF4A-CYP3A7, and SMAD2/SMAD3/SOX2/TP63/HNF4A-UGT1As regulatory pathways.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhaowei Qu"", ids = ""46988987""); list(name = ""Di Li"", ids = ""1802612""); list(name = ""Haitao Xu"", ids = ""1895598""); list(name = ""Rujia Zhang"", ids = ""11727300""); list(name = ""Bing Li"", ids = ""48218695""); list(name = ""Chengming Sun"", ids = ""1821130""); list(name = ""Wei Dong"", ids = ""144980063""); list(name = ""Yubao Zhang"", ids = ""2988469"")",d94a45910548498af8a471581e4acbb0ec69445d; 8df5b9dc51bf7a39c20aa463f5c660e5e1cb6652; d7577798a9a706ab0f09e05321c9465a9e0b0c1f; d342dba9b5ca425452e0e683aea1d1d9c8e0e1be,7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 7dc1558853fd6d7504e14ccbbdb86109c1d30b56; 03094c68e9333dbfb17426d22d4e61748d92e414; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; 395e8445c15dbecd0d936ea2f3e41a01bc34d0a0; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 7a7fd74b7f5f9fd75ad729942c11ce1c996c7c03; ed9c202d218805dbe1b8e2d2e4135f546231d353; 7aad459a7536f83c5a4ffea8cf2701c6de0ee5a3; befc63a2012f4c28241529c3c268bdcd30e58dd9; bbe7ada17ffecb098f6d17d3c85a6685995c2b73; b37d1e07de30b7061be39f766fec1dd8c73de7be; 2515e0eb321c558629678b0c34447b40725ed989; 6f0937e2560872f87a1136b13a16b2ed16705e14; 3b313c02ffbe12d5e2b939781050f9877a4cd446; b247bb08f116a181faa34e0e5806935a08b59dc5; 2b6b408634f7565fdb5de8f1321f7fbd9c432d61; 71598cb1c487a2ddba64a570ff64028d1981d8ac; b38dce0f481fdeb4501fa414677ac06df37b07d8; 17d61a353bb9f1b83b2f453779dbb37e2d358410; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 175ce400b93ce56fc8f1c791b01f88143c9b7b85; fe92d7e2a85f32355c7cf0807a98016208fe3ab5; 0543b82abeca05b576eb7745744dc0eb1ff5a4ca; da308a1752449882493f100fd3e98639119c74b6; 5da0085aa72345585e74f39dd0dcc029aec8f28f; ed42b34cd79b1180e0d62a0dc8e6a3a79dadd350; 22240f28efd8676d901773545e92eeb94a5f1344; fa8b3b9b23079b3039a9b0279f8f1bc154ea7c3c; 630383b299d8e307665f0c4c95638b29f004fab7; 42f02ebed6db9f81df601d9d155052519498913a; 5ab3a3e1254713729aaa777aa84ee4b28cdab9f5; ae02d7e851f8d934c05c298a522129a0b4d65f23; 02f017392e3e4b51561bed4be1b237c0abc50ede; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 82da35698d7a528dfcb98c90dc5241c9b1c9789a; 955fe5b0eb5e9fefab7bf21dede20e1285dca410; dd30e965c732d5d0207ed8afc3c29fdb39840d43; 0bc796583e60d91dee8aab601c6ff9ca7733ee40; 0a70e82b4ee956e48816aedec65276b57eb8f88b; 1385eee1d71a171655597b50686b49325e299e55; fe6e9641b4e1791f9b0c94a518da51894f679220,Annals of hepatology,15 4,"

eee1ee67b114a55c19d801e2deb4c15fa31f66ab,"Genetic variants in sex hormone pathways and the risk of type 2 diabetes among African American, Hispanic American, and European American postmenopausal women in the US","BACKGROUND
Sex hormones are implicated in the development of diabetes. However, whether genetic variations in sex hormone pathways (SHPs) contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains to be determined. This study investigated associations between genetic variations in all candidate genes in SHPs and T2DM risk among a cohort of women participating in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).


METHODS
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 30â€‰kb upstream and downstream of SHP genes were comprehensively examined in 8180 African American, 3498 Hispanic American, and 3147 European American women in the WHI. In addition, whether significant SNPs would be replicated in independent populations was examined.


RESULTS
After adjusting for age, region, and ancestry estimates and correcting for multiple testing, seven SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of T2DM among Hispanic American women were identified in the progesterone receptor (PGR) gene, with rs948516 showing the greatest significance (odds ratio 0.67; 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.78; Pâ€‰=â€‰8.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7 ; false discovery rate, Qâ€‰=â€‰7.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4 ). These findings were not replicated in other ethnic groups in the WHI or in sex-combined analyses in replication studies.


CONCLUSION
Significant signals were identified implicating the PGR gene in T2DM development in Hispanic American women in the WHI, which are consistent with genome-wide association studies findings linking PGR to glucose homeostasis. Nevertheless, the PGR SNPs-T2DM association was not statistically significant in other ethnic populations. Further studies, especially sex-specific analyses, are needed to confirm the findings and clarify the role of SHPs in T2DM.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Atsushi Goto"", ids = ""38623383""); list(name = ""Brian H Chen"", ids = ""145957540""); list(name = ""Kei-hang K Chan"", ids = ""15459099""); list(name = ""Cathy Lee"", ids = ""20958750""); list(name = ""Sarah C.

The recent release of large molecular cell line datasets labeled for drug sensitivity enables the development of such predictors. Cell line based models poorly reflect the extent of molecular heterogeneity and of tumor microenvironment relationships existing at the patient level. We aimed to overcome these limitations by combining cell line datasets with patient cohorts to uncover novel molecular traits associated with drug response at the patient level.

Methods: For building our model, we used the following publicly available datasets: CCLE (1057 cell lines, 24 drugs), Sanger (790 cell lines, 138 drugs) and TCGA (patients: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung squamous carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer and melanoma). A joint semi-supervised trained Elastic Net approach was used to model drug sensitivity (both conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy) using gene-expression, copy-number alteration, and somatic mutation data. We introduced a false discovery rate estimation for selecting significant aberrations. As validation, we used pooled RNAi screens (NKI, Netherlands) and also a dataset of 120 patients prospectively enrolled in the ongoing MOSCATO molecular screening program (Gustave Roussy, France) (presented at ASCO 2013).

Results: Drug sensitivity models trained in the entire set of cell lines performed better than models trained using tissue specific cell lines, whatever the drug and the tissue type. Novel molecular traits (mutation, copy number variation) were identified by selecting highly performant models (AUC > .75) across drug and tissue type combinations. We were able to recover all of the recognized landmark biomarkers across drug - tissue combination (e.g. Erlotinib: EGFR mutation in lung adenocarcinoma; Lapatanib: ERBB2 amplification in breast cancer; Vemurafenib: BRAF mutation in melanoma, etc). Moreover, we uncovered novel molecular traits (copy, number mutations) associated (FDR<25%) with drug response (e.g. Erlotinib: CDKN2A deletion in lung adenocarcinoma; Lapatanib: CDH1 deletion in breast cancer; Vemurafenib: FH amplification in melanoma, etc.). The validation of our framework in the pooled RNAi screens of colorectal and lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and in the MOSCATO patient's cohort will be presented.

Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive annotation of mutations and copy-number events in tumors predicted to be associated with sensitivity and resistance in 142 anti-cancer drugs and across 7 tumor types. These molecular traits can be used to refine the results of large scale functional genomic experiments such as RNAi screens and ultimately in the early clinical trial setting.

However, the underlying expression profiling and prospective signal pathways of miRNAs associated with lncRNA HOXA11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS) in NSCLC remain unknown. Methods: HOXA11-AS was knocked down in A549 cell line and a microarray assay was used to detect the changes of the miRNA profiles. Four miRNA target prediction algorithms were applied to predict the potential target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and network analysis, were performed to investigate the potential functions, pathways and networks of the target genes. The different expression of HOXA11-AS between normal lung and NSCLC tissues was further verified by the data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, the relationship between the expression of HOXA11-AS and clinical diagnostic value was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Among all the miRNAs from the microarray, 43 and 18 miRNAs were upregulated and downregulated in NSCLC, respectively. According to the degree of the fold change, p value and false discovery rate (FDR), the top five upregulated and downregulated miRNAs were selected for further investigation. GO analysis on the target genes revealed that these de-regulated miRNAs were involved in complex cellular pathways, such as transcription, cell junction and transcription factor activity. KEGG pathway analysis showed that Wnt signaling pathway might be involved in regulating these 10 candidate miRNAs. XRN1 (degree = 23) and EP300 (degree = 20) had highest degree and interactions in the PPI network. Additionally, we found that HOXA11-AS was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tissues based on TCGA database. The ROC curve revealed that the area under curve (AUC) of HOXA11-AS was 0.727 (95% CI 0.663~0.790) for lung adenocarcinoma and 0.933 (95% CI 0.906~0.960) for squamous cell carcinoma patients. Conclusions: Our results provide significant information on miRNAs related to HOXA11-AS in NSCLC and we hypothesize that HOXA11-AS might play a key role in NSCLC by regulating the expression of miRNAs through Wnt signaling pathway, which would be valuable for further investigation into the possible molecular mechanisms in NSCLC.",2017,,"list(name = ""Yu Zhang"", ids = ""49891115""); list(name = ""Ting-qing Gan"", ids = ""40517847""); list(name = ""Xiaobo Wang"", ids = ""50141289""); list(name = ""Han-Lin Wang"", ids = ""7644422""); list(name = ""Xiu-ling Zhang"", ids = ""46448159""); list(name = ""Yi-wu Dang"", ids = ""47392323""); list(name = ""Su-ning Huang"", ids = ""7650012""); list(name = ""Dian-zhong Luo"", ids = ""4038208""); list(name = ""Ping Li"", ids = ""48982033""); list(name = ""Rong-quan He"", ids = ""52183579""); list(name = ""Zu-yun Li"", ids = ""10232257""); list(name = ""Gang Chen"", ids = ""30500606"")",,afa5aae7769e1813591da39c67644b27d4e0d612; 1b787eee6fd37d54808bf266f87246def9dce49c; 3ab15246167e6830ba823cacbfdba87bd73f88cf; 2943f4d252c003b020390d8f38c9cc7f8a43d17b; 99649284503c2abe6871ae45f3dbf394a3a86352; 93bebf9c5904d760791643f5371d9d7ee6dadb94; 771499bc92cf032a783450b2246074b57c3c52d1; d11b02f5055ea6c57d78ebfe58b7ba894d4384f2; ebe3492f7e3ae79f65ff4afcd5a711b9c8fe5259; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; 5d3905de5349d897d62de73e0f951388a704f230; 741a910387c71c113298c318e32952090aa09eb4; c34d32eb8c9c44c342f1ab8f4e53d0e67580cfa7; e024ee20365a4bb64ec5fed3d4678c5b0da7a701; a3ae416b2910b2083e6c263083fcec0b2d75b914; f373de11f7a6db2f269e13be66027936569f6c73; 8f41dfe1cf3ddf5e1ed25604f8c66e4ee54b96ee; 74684502b77057626c886a74f4c9b4a054e5c4cd; fd2298d3d8ee9c53770b1023d98a01fb40297d64; da7018a5c0ccab4f8e76b1a86594f95018cdba15; 0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7; d1bd051e52e47f8c0badc11c83414a362d68e3ce; 6b418190bee10899f9b9a3f0b45d6c372510e01b; d8a217fa9d91e298142c8cf523ebb1ea27a40a4c; 49b10dcaeb6b2df5a15b1ca69bc553d7ce140686; cf6d726bb3f75fde5f0bb4adce3fc8927d99f616; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 829b093c53cb4a7a20a39af5adf5e1f8aa81d518; 1114614155ca0087742e7e38a072a59e50f92c2d; ef4220a91549e4e27deb1bf642862c3f1bb03e9c; 17f0f9535bbf851c7e2d4ebe674252b1ffcdbb79; 68c5a6048f15852341e824e070cf8c1332e5a558; 9419d5ffc33506e319e782917d0e87730f318f11; 5930440ec05116267538da47a6d975e42f649714; bdf936d40041bdf96cf7cd88c993ec0523e40e34; ae7223dd2792c8307ad080e1949a116bcb32b403; 4c2bf432ff2f802cc5e05a913c5c2899f22087b6; 4d05e84c1a72ddad489159e01f0a8b339f132a45,,,
9d057f94f3e51b432434f53e32fc5e66077cf6ec,Probing the Virtual Proteome to Identify Novel Disease Biomarkers,"Background: Proteomic approaches allow measurement of thousands of proteins in a single specimen, which can accelerate biomarker discovery. However, applying these technologies to massive biobanks is not currently feasible because of the practical barriers and costs of implementing such assays at scale. To overcome these challenges, we used a â€œvirtual proteomicâ€ approach, linking genetically predicted protein levels to clinical diagnoses in >40â€‰000 individuals. Methods: We used genome-wide association data from the Framingham Heart Study (n=759) to construct genetic predictors for 1129 plasma protein levels. We validated the genetic predictors for 268 proteins and used them to compute predicted protein levels in 41â€‰288 genotyped individuals in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) cohort. We tested associations for each predicted protein with 1128 clinical phenotypes. Lead associations were validated with directly measured protein levels and either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or subclinical atherosclerosis in the MDCS (MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Study; n=651). Results: In the virtual proteomic analysis in eMERGE, 55 proteins were associated with 89 distinct diagnoses at a false discovery rate q<0.1. Among these, 13 associations involved lipid (n=7) or atherosclerosis (n=6) phenotypes. We tested each association for validation in MDCS using directly measured protein levels. At Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds, levels of apolipoprotein E isoforms were associated with hyperlipidemia, and circulating C-type lectin domain family 1 member B and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-&bgr; predicted subclinical atherosclerosis. Odds ratios for carotid atherosclerosis were 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08â€“1.58; P=0.006) per 1-SD increment in C-type lectin domain family 1 member B and 0.79 (0.66â€“0.94; P=0.008) per 1-SD increment in platelet-derived growth factor receptor-&bgr;.

b09cf28cecb53eeb1d5c0e6e451ee7ed0f7f3695,Detection of the number of signals using a multiple hypothesis test,"This work presents a novel approach to detect multiple signals embedded in noisy observations of a sensor array. We formulate the detection problem as a multiple hypothesis test. To control the global level of the multiple test, we apply the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion recently suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg instead of the classical familywise error rate (FWE) criterion. The proposed method is tested by the simulated data. Results show that the FDR-controlling procedure is more powerful than the FWE- controlling procedure. The performance improvement is most significant for a large number of signals and low SNRs.",2004,Computer Science,"list(name = ""P.-J. Chung"", ids = ""39215164""); list(name = ""J.

11c3130600c247278fa183493ae1fa6714a66362,Association of UGT1A1 Variants and Hyperbilirubinemia in Breast-Fed Full-Term Chinese Infants,"A retrospective case control study of breast-fed full-term infants was carried out to determine whether variants in Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronosyl Transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and Heme Oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) were associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Eight genetic variants of UGT1A1 and 3 genetic variants of HMOX1 were genotyped in 170 hyperbilirubinemic newborns and 779 controls. Five significant associations with breast-fed hyperbilirubinemia were detected after adjusting for gender, birth season, birth weight, delivery mode, gestational age and False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction: the dominant effect of rs887829 (c-364t) (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.55; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.34-0.89; pâ€Š=â€Š0.014), the additive effect of (TA)n repeat (OR: 0.59; 95%CI: 0.38-0.91; pâ€Š=â€Š0.017), the dominant effect of rs4148323 (Gly71Arg, G211A) (OR: 2.02; 95%CI: 1.44-2.85; pâ€Š=â€Š5.0Ã—10-5), the recessive effect of rs6717546 (g+914a) (OR: 0.30; 95%CI: 0.11-0.83; pâ€Š=â€Š0.021) and rs6719561 (t+2558c) (OR: 0.38; 95%CI: 0.20-0.75; pâ€Š=â€Š0.005). Neonates carrying the minor allele of rs887829 (TA)n repeat had significantly lower peak bilirubin than wild types, while the minor allele carriers of rs4148323 had significantly higher peak bilirubin than wild types. No association was found in HMOX1. Our findings added to the understanding of the significance of UGT1A1 in association with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in East Asian population.

e499d251438672415b189fae0da2aafbe5031db0,Validation of HOBO PendantÂ® data loggers for automated step detection in two age classes of male turkeys: growers and finishers,"Activity levels can be used as a predictor of health status, physical condition, feed efficiency, and coping style in animals. Small, portable data loggers have been validated as an inexpensive and effective alternative to video or live observation for automated activity detection in several livestock species. Our study aimed to validate the use of Onset HOBO Pendant (R) G acceleration data loggers for automated step detection in two age classes of male turkeys: growers and finishers. The loggers were attached to one leg in an elastic harness and programmed to record each turkey's leg accelerations every 0.1 s. For the grower turkeys, the activities of 60 males were recorded in a runway twice per week from 9-11 weeks of age. In the finisher trial, the loggers were attached to eight 14 week old male turkeys to record their stepping activities in a trial pen over 54 min. Simultaneous video observation allowed for logger suitability to be determined for reporting walking activity. The 0.1 s data points were identified as either: true positives, false positives, false negatives, or true negatives then the logger sensitivity, false discovery rate, specificity, precision, and accuracy were calculated for each turkey run. Over the 309 grower turkey runs, 4364 steps were observed in the video while the loggers detected 4865 steps. The grower logger results showed a mean sensitivity of 96.02 +/- 6.82%, specificity of 99.10 +/- 0.86%, and an average false discovery rate of 12.41 +/- 110.13% for step detection (mean standard deviation). For the grower turkey loggers, the mean precision and accuracy for step detection were 87.59 +/- 10.13% and 98.95 +/- 0.77%. For the eight finisher turkeys, a total of 2420 steps were seen by the video and the loggers recorded 2691 data points as steps. The finisher turkey logger data showed a mean sensitivity of 89.58 +/- 11.75%, mean false discovery rate of 14.73 +/- 10.66%, and average specificity of 99.81 +/- 0.19%. The finisher logger results had a mean precision of 85.27 +/- 10.66% and a mean accuracy of 99.73 +/- 0.13%. Although the loggers showed high sensitivity for detecting turkey steps under research settings, future research should try to reduce the loggers' susceptibility to background noise, which would improve their performance for application in commercial conditions.

e6d9ae968f5bfaec4a352ef55d355fc1848a7940,Tumour initiating cells and IGF/FGF signalling contribute to sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Objective Sorafenib is effective in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but patients ultimately present disease progression. Molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are still unknown. Herein, we characterise the role of tumourâ€initiating cells (Tâ€ICs) and signalling pathways involved in sorafenib resistance. Design HCC xenograft mice treated with sorafenib (n=22) were explored for responsiveness (n=5) and acquired resistance (n=17). Mechanism of acquired resistance were assessed by: (1) role of Tâ€ICs by in vitro sphere formation and in vivo tumourigenesis assays using NOD/SCID mice, (2) activation of alternative signalling pathways and (3) efficacy of antiâ€FGF and antiâ€IGF drugs in experimental models. Gene expression (microarray, quantitative realâ€time PCR (qRTâ€PCR)) and protein analyses (immunohistochemistry, western blot) were conducted. A novel gene signature of sorafenib resistance was generated and tested in two independent cohorts. Results Sorafenibâ€acquired resistant tumours showed significant enrichment of Tâ€ICs (164 cells needed to create a tumour) versus sorafenibâ€sensitive tumours (13â–¡400 cells) and nonâ€treated tumours (1292 cells), p<0.001. Tumours with sorafenibâ€acquired resistance were enriched with insulinâ€like growth factor (IGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling cascades (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05). In vitro, cells derived from sorafenibâ€acquired resistant tumours and two sorafenibâ€resistant HCC cell lines were responsive to IGF or FGF inhibition. In vivo, FGF blockade delayed tumour growth and improved survival in sorafenibâ€resistant tumours. A sorafenibâ€resistance 175 gene signature was characterised by enrichment of progenitor cell features, aggressive tumorous traits and predicted poor survival in two cohorts (n=442 patients with HCC). Conclusions Acquired resistance to sorafenib is driven by Tâ€ICs with enrichment of progenitor markers and activation of IGF and FGF signalling. Inhibition of these pathways would benefit a subset of patients after sorafenib progression.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Victoria Gomez Tovar"", ids = ""5582503""); list(name = ""Helena Cornella"", ids = ""49657232""); list(name = ""Agrin Moeini"", ids = ""1869668""); list(name = ""Samuel Vidal"", ids = ""153245020""); list(name = ""Yujin Hoshida"", ids = ""4083750""); list(name = ""Daniela Sia"", ids = ""4588879""); list(name = ""Judit Peix"", ids = ""9832600""); list(name = ""L.

123c5cbbe80f694152fbf4610f307691757502ca,Identification of Significant Features by the Global Mean Rank Test,"With the introduction of omics-technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics, numerous methods for the reliable identification of significantly regulated features (genes, proteins, etc.) have been developed. Experimental practice requires these tests to successfully deal with conditions such as small numbers of replicates, missing values, non-normally distributed expression levels, and non-identical distributions of features. With the MeanRank test we aimed at developing a test that performs robustly under these conditions, while favorably scaling with the number of replicates. The test proposed here is a global one-sample location test, which is based on the mean ranks across replicates, and internally estimates and controls the false discovery rate. Furthermore, missing data is accounted for without the need of imputation. In extensive simulations comparing MeanRank to other frequently used methods, we found that it performs well with small and large numbers of replicates, feature dependent variance between replicates, and variable regulation across features on simulation data and a recent two-color microarray spike-in dataset. The tests were then used to identify significant changes in the phosphoproteomes of cancer cells induced by the kinase inhibitors erlotinib and 3-MB-PP1 in two independently published mass spectrometry-based studies. MeanRank outperformed the other global rank-based methods applied in this study. Compared to the popular Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Linear Models for Microarray methods, MeanRank performed similar or better. Furthermore, MeanRank exhibits more consistent behavior regarding the degree of regulation and is robust against the choice of preprocessing methods. MeanRank does not require any imputation of missing values, is easy to understand, and yields results that are easy to interpret.

76502af2befb9cf16ad8a1ddbe5f34f448106c50,Quadratic variance models for adaptively preprocessing SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry data,"BackgroundSurface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI) is a proteomics tool for biomarker discovery and other high throughput applications. Previous studies have identified various areas for improvement in preprocessing algorithms used for protein peak detection. Bottom-up approaches to preprocessing that emphasize modeling SELDI data acquisition are promising avenues of research to find the needed improvements in reproducibility.ResultsWe studied the properties of the SELDI detector intensity response to matrix only runs. The intensity fluctuations and noise observed can be characterized by a natural exponential family with quadratic variance function (NEF-QVF) class of distributions. These include as special cases many common distributions arising in practice (e.g.- normal, Poisson). Taking this model into account, we present a modified Antoniadis-Sapatinas wavelet denoising algorithm as the core of our preprocessing program, implemented in MATLAB. The proposed preprocessing approach shows superior peak detection sensitivity compared to MassSpecWavelet for false discovery rate (FDR) values less than 25%.ConclusionsThe NEF-QVF detector model requires that certain parameters be measured from matrix only spectra, leaving implications for new experiment design at the trade-off of slightly increased cost. These additional measurements allow our preprocessing program to adapt to changing noise characteristics arising from intralaboratory and across-laboratory factors. With further development, this approach may lead to improved peak prediction reproducibility and nearly automated, high throughput preprocessing of SELDI data.",2010,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vincent A.

d288eb57e2129be494b1436da050549705dd0a3a,Assessment of Metabolome Annotation Quality: A Method for Evaluating the False Discovery Rate of Elemental Composition Searches,"BACKGROUND
In metabolomics researches using mass spectrometry (MS), systematic searching of high-resolution mass data against compound databases is often the first step of metabolite annotation to determine elemental compositions possessing similar theoretical mass numbers. However, incorrect hits derived from errors in mass analyses will be included in the results of elemental composition searches. To assess the quality of peak annotation information, a novel methodology for false discovery rates (FDR) evaluation is presented in this study. Based on the FDR analyses, several aspects of an elemental composition search, including setting a threshold, estimating FDR, and the types of elemental composition databases most reliable for searching are discussed.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
The FDR can be determined from one measured value (i.e., the hit rate for search queries) and four parameters determined by Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that relatively high FDR values (30-50%) were obtained when searching time-of-flight (TOF)/MS data using the KNApSAcK and KEGG databases. In addition, searches against large all-in-one databases (e.g., PubChem) always produced unacceptable results (FDR >70%). The estimated FDRs suggest that the quality of search results can be improved not only by performing more accurate mass analysis but also by modifying the properties of the compound database. A theoretical analysis indicates that FDR could be improved by using compound database with smaller but higher completeness entries.

df559fed86a746c229a5b597f2d45e4b1bc97b75,Vector-model-supported optimization in volumetric-modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy planning for brain metastasis.,"Long planning time in volumetric-modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy (VMA-SRT) cases can limit its clinical efficiency and use. A vector model could retrieve previously successful radiotherapy cases that share various common anatomic features with the current case. The prsent study aimed to develop a vector model that could reduce planning time by applying the optimization parameters from those retrieved reference cases. Thirty-six VMA-SRT cases of brain metastasis (gender, male [nâ€‰=â€‰23], female [nâ€‰=â€‰13]; age range, 32 to 81 years old) were collected and used as a reference database. Another 10 VMA-SRT cases were planned with both conventional optimization and vector-model-supported optimization, following the oncologists' clinical dose prescriptions. Planning time and plan quality measures were compared using the 2-sided paired Wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of 0.05, with positive false discovery rate (pFDR) of less than 0.05. With vector-model-supported optimization, there was a significant reduction in the median planning time, a 40% reduction from 3.7 to 2.2 hours (pâ€‰=â€‰0.002, pFDRâ€‰=â€‰0.032), and for the number of iterations, a 30% reduction from 8.5 to 6.0 (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006, pFDRâ€‰=â€‰0.047). The quality of plans from both approaches was comparable. From these preliminary results, vector-model-supported optimization can expedite the optimization of VMA-SRT for brain metastasis while maintaining plan quality.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eva Sau Fan Liu"", ids = ""50323864""); list(name = ""Vincent Wing Cheung Wu"", ids = ""37684307""); list(name = ""Benjamin Harris"", ids = ""48296631""); list(name = ""Matthew Foote"", ids = ""145090816""); list(name = ""Margot Lehman"", ids = ""39628039""); list(name = ""Lawrence Wing Chi Chan"", ids = ""144039188"")",281673974b0192883a9344de8d14714110e9179e; ea997f8757fa8000e3037ae8d016495f62e95895; 3348fb223ca6f0c83b89a9f18963a2c1f768ddcb; 1a1ce5bb66235774d960487a0285ab91339bbd4b,,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,42 2,"

5a1fd78bb04cb6de99505f20a1efa1360f85dbc7,Comparison of Pinnacle and SameSpots for Spot Quantification and Differential Expression in 2-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis Studies,"2-DE is an important method for proteomics. Accurate spot detection and quantification on the resulting images is a challenging task, but must be done effectively for the technology to fulfill its potential. Traditional analytical methods have significant weaknesses, including spot mismatching and missing data. These problems require time-consuming manual editing to correct, which dramatically decreases throughput and compromises the objectivity and reproducibility of the analysis. To address this issue, we developed Pinnacle, a new method that markedly improves spot detection and quantification precision. Another new method implemented in Progenesis SameSpots, a commercial 2-DE analysis product, has also been touted as an improvement upon traditional approaches. In this study, we compared Pinnacle and SameSpots in spot detection and precision of quantification using two different dilution series, and evaluated the detection of differentially expressed proteins in two differential expression experiments. We found that SameSpots at times had problems with spot delineation, while Pinnacle did not. While both Pinnacle and SameSpots showed marked improvement in precision of spot quantifications over conventional methods, Pinnacle yielded spot quantifications with greater validity and reliability than SameSpots. Pinnacle detected more differentially expressed proteins than SameSpots, which may be a result of its increased precision and improved spot delineation.

add1dee64e4003d2e872a4924d83d4850ffd4e67,HiChIP-Peaks: A HiChIP peak calling algorithm,"Motivation HiChIP is a powerful tool to interrogate 3D chromatin organization. Current tools to analyse chromatin looping mechanisms using HiChIP data require the identification of loop anchors to work properly. However, current approaches to discover these anchors from HiChIP data are not satisfactory, having either a very high false discovery rate or strong dependence on sequencing depth. Moreover, these tools do not allow quantitative comparison of peaks across different samples, failing to fully exploit the information available from HiChIP datasets. Results We develop a new tool based on a representation of HiChIP data centred on the re-ligation sites to identify peaks from HiChIP datasets, which can subsequently be used in other tools for loop discovery. This increases the reliability of these tools and improves recall rate as sequencing depth is reduced. We also provide a method to count reads mapping to peaks across samples, which can be used for differential peak analysis using HiChIP data.

3470efe5487140679a2e79a9d423498c07b6a1da,Analysis of the spleen proteome of chickens infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus,"Infection with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), a gammaretrovirus in the family Retroviridae, can result in immunosuppression and subsequent increased susceptibility to secondary infections. In the present study, we identified differentially expressed proteins in the spleens of chickens infected with the REV-A HLJ07I strain, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on samples from time points coinciding with different phases of the REV life cycle. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using one-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (1D LC ESI MS/MS). Comparative analysis of multiple gels revealed that the majority of changes occurred at early stages of infection. In total, 60 protein spots representing 28 host proteins were detected as either quantitatively (false discovery rate [FDR]Â â‰¤0.05 and fold changeÂ â‰¥2) or qualitatively differentially expressed at least once during different sampling points. The differentially expressed proteins identified in this study included antioxidants, molecular chaperones, cellular metabolism, formation of the cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell proliferation and cellar aging. The present findings provide a basis for further studies to elucidate the role of these proteins in REV-host interactions.

ed53c0abca1ca08d5cfa1b3ba3c10b0dc2fef985,Plasma exosomal miRNAs-based prognosis in metastatic kidney cancer,"Plasma exosomal miRNAs were evaluated for prognosis in an initial set of 44 metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients by RNA sequencing. Among ~3.49 million mappable reads per patient, miRNAs accounted for 93.1% of the mapped RNAs. 227 miRNAs with high abundance were selected for survival analysis. Cox regression analysis identified association of 6 miRNAs with overall survival (OS) (P<0.01, False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.3). Five of the associated miRNAs were quantified in an independent follow-up cohort of 65 mRCC patients by TaqMan-based miRNA assays. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed the significant OS association of three miRs; miR-let-7i-5p (P=0.018, HR=0.49, 95% CI=0.21-0.84), miR-26a-1-3p (P=0.025, HR=0.43, 95% CI=0.10-0.84) and miR-615-3p (P=0.0007, HR=0.36, 95% CI=0.11-0.54). A multivariate analysis of miR-let-7i-5p with the clinical factor-based Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score improved survival prediction from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.58 for MSKCC score to an average AUC of 0.64 across 48-month follow-up time. The multivariate model was able to define a high-risk group with median survival of 14 months and low risk group of 39 months (P=0.0002, HR=3.43, 95%CI, 2.73-24.15). Further validation of miRNA-based prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve current clinic-pathologic based prognostic models in patients with mRCC.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Meijun Du"", ids = ""6149531""); list(name = ""Karthik V Giridhar"", ids = ""49448596""); list(name = ""Yijun Tian"", ids = ""6382752""); list(name = ""Michael R.

We compare Clements and Sarkarâ€™s Procedure 35.1 with the False Cluster Proportion-based algorithm of Friedenberg and Genovese (arXiv:0910.5449, 2009). The former employs pixel-wise error control, while the latter employs cluster-wise error control. We find the two techniques yield source lists of similar efficiency (finding â‰ˆ 50% of the sources detected by a more computationally intensive procedure) and purity ( â‰ˆ 100%), if one eliminates single-pixel detections made by the Clements and Sarkar procedure. We propose that the Clements and Sarkar procedure be refined such that only statistically significant clusters are retained in the final source list, mitigating the issue of single-pixel detections and potentially improving the procedureâ€™s efficiency.",2012,Physics,"list(name = ""Peter Edward Freeman"", ids = ""145986297"")",,,,,397-401
0c46cc0f1ff02fcce6990f964651711d35525fcf,Differential gene expression profile in PBMCs from subjects with AERD and ATA: a gene marker for AERD,"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is associated with severe asthma and aspirin can cause asthma to worsen, often in the form of a severe and sudden attack. The oral aspirin challenge is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis of AERD, but it is time consuming and produces serious complications in some cases. Therefore, more efficient and practical method is needed to predict AERD patients. The aim of the present study was to identify AERD-related gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and examine the diagnostic potential of these candidate gene(s) for predicting AERD. To do this, RNAs from 24 subjects with AERD and 18 subjects with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) were subjected to microarray analysis of ~34,560 genes. In total, 10 genes were selected as candidate gene markers by applying pÂ â‰¤Â 0.001(t test) and â‰¥8-fold change, and to correct for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate analyses were performed. By applying multiple logistic regression analysis, among possible 1,023 models (210â€“1), a model consisting of CNKSR3, SPTBN2, and IMPACT was selected as candidate set, because this set showed the best AUC (0.98) with 88Â % sensitivity and 89Â % specificity. For validation, mRNA levels by real-time PCR on PBMCs from two population sets in a gene-chip study and another replication sample, 20 AERD, 20 ATA, and 8 normal controls, were significantly different between groups with 100Â % sensitivity and 100Â % specificity in each of the two population sets. However, IMPACT gene did not differentiate between AERD and normal controls. The set of the two genes (CNKSR3 and SPTBN2) showed the best AUC (0.96) with 88Â % sensitivity and 94Â % specificity in a gene-chip study sample. In addition, this set showed perfect discriminative power with AUC (1.0, 100Â % sensitivity and 100Â % specificity) in each of the two population sets: the gene-chip samples and the replication samples. It also showed perfect discrimination for AERD from NC (AUC: 1.0) and ATA from NC (AUC: 1.0). In conclusion, we developed the two gene markers (CNKSR3 and SPTBN2) of PBMC which differentiate between AERD and ATA with a perfect discriminative power.

We find evidence in favor of mutual funds being able to time the market. Our results indicate that mutual fund managers do not possess size, value or momentum-based timing skills. Concerning the relation between fund characteristics and style timing, we find that expense and turnover are positively associated with market timing and value timing but negatively associated with momentum timing, which is likely to be attributable to different investment objectives. In addition, we examine market timing skill persistence by controlling the FDR and find that Chinese stock mutual funds are able to exhibit market timing persistence.",2016,Economics,"list(name = ""Li Yi"", ids = ""145951509""); list(name = ""Lei He"", ids = ""145836234"")",e685ce4c8fe3e4e49331926f6faa9aa684c63d80; 3a2f89edbe01bf909fac98b4f72317b8280ffc20,,Pacific-basin Finance Journal,38,194-208

Methods and Results We determined incident coronary artery disease risk for 755 members of 66 hyperlipidemic families (â‰¥2 first-degree relatives with similar hyperlipidemia) and 19Â 644 Finnish FINRISK population study participants. We quantified 151 circulating lipid species from 550 members of 73 hyperlipidemic families and 897 FINRISK participants using mass spectrometric shotgun lipidomics. Familial hypercholesterolemia was excluded using functional LDL receptor testing and genotyping. Hyperlipidemias ( LDL -C or triacylglycerides >90th population percentile) associated with increased coronary artery disease risk in meta-analysis of the hyperlipidemic families and the population cohort (high LDL -C: hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.48-2.04]; high triacylglycerides: hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.09-1.74]). Risk estimates were similar in the family and population cohorts also after adjusting for lipid-lowering medication. In lipidomic profiling, high LDL -C associated with 108 lipid species, and high triacylglycerides associated with 131 lipid species in either cohort (at 5% false discovery rate; P-value range 0.038-2.3Ã—10-56). Lipidomic profiles were highly similar for hyperlipidemic individuals in the families and the population ( LDL -C: r=0.80; triacylglycerides: r=0.96; no lipid species deviated between the cohorts). Conclusions Hyperlipidemias with family history conferred similar coronary artery disease risk as population-based hyperlipidemias. We identified distinct lipidomic profiles associated with high LDL -C and triacylglycerides. Lipidomic profiles were similar between hyperlipidemias with family history and population-ascertained hyperlipidemias, providing evidence of similar and overlapping underlying mechanisms.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Joel T.

Applying a stringent Bonferroni correction, no statistically significant results were found. Applying a more lenient criterion based on false discovery rate led to several hundred possibly significant correlations between SNPs and phenotypes.

4060fcc520700ea600ca82f37f1492bf2fcaa557,Incorporating phylogenetic information in microbiome abundance studies has no effect on detection power and FDR control,"We consider the problem of incorporating evolutionary information (e.g. taxonomic or phylogenic trees) in the context of metagenomics differential analysis. Recent results published in the literature propose different ways to leverage the tree structure to increase the detection rate of differentially abundant taxa. Here, we propose instead to use a different hierachical structure, in the form of a correlation-based tree, as it may capture the structure of the data better than the phylogeny. We first show that the correlation tree and the phylogeny are significantly different before turning to the impact of tree choice on detection rates. Using synthetic data, we show that the tree does have an impact: smoothing p-values according to the phylogeny leads to equal or inferior rates as smoothing according to the correlation tree. However, both trees are outperformed by the classical, non hierachical, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure in terms of detection rates. Other procedures may use the hierachical structure with profit but do not control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) a priori and remain inferior to a classical Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with the same nominal FDR. On real datasets, no hierarchical procedure had significantly higher detection rate that BH. Although intuition advocates the use of a hierachical structure, be it the phylogeny or the correlation tree, to increase the detection rate in microbiome studies, current hierachical procedures are still inferior to non hierachical ones and effective procedures remain to be invented.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Antoine Bichat"", ids = ""1576544538""); list(name = ""Jonathan Plassais"", ids = ""50552433""); list(name = ""Christophe Ambroise"", ids = ""2952661""); list(name = ""Mahendra Mariadassou"", ids = ""1863118"")",,83939f37c4792e9edf0437f2928fa46a44aac016; 060fbb7ae458fa71a477ff22f825b6c06344b773; c2ec6c73933f0fd274e932f6756febdbc5c60ff4; 72a60a8c5ea2635b4536e2924cf222084f528b16; 5025c942b1c5ac33ce4e0996bef72493d7b118b2; 61076194ec631a89daa30edbcc90bc7be37804cc; c82e6dbd5b34d1ebc435c81a0e5bb774a6f7b998; d5677974ad0a645fbb71a6dc0355c54005239882; 733958e3fc5a21b3c89d6f88bf3b0fa2b1caa0ad; 4ead4d868721e8b38c266415a1f6201cd147a78a; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a; 0c5520f0980ebbae1273bc5a51b50afb03901944; 0a2b7701fb57b76da0738d56856b5e83aa983744; 9526214b21a2acee1af70ed6a62e386306a98989; 6e4f63bef83267839b36b67ee5e6f0772846018e; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; 430c5e6f0fb43860d3d6b9cfba35ff6b78fded53; c97638e535d5d9a87f6c8deb38c06c2b7e922c61; 232db55ff77c0a9fb991a6660a75ea03bbe3c2b9; 9efd70d2c06733704220313fb67720aa45c6362a; d898f2d6b3b98340ed97da0a064208b9b9bb67ab; 842074f879730589df9d2e9d5589100eeb66ca14; 75c4e675027dfda388b2d29509e2597742f00cbf; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 9c50c0bd263f181d4c2ff74b99f433cc2c6b1066; 30bcf9f512e9af5089108acf5c4183b21dfd77e9; 35fb143b230377d47214c09a7ce0608357afeb6b; f46c758d007ec833cb86132a789d5778d0d7687f; 07cf9752417c8ba856ecbb4f6cc5bd8833200dff; 79d096e7a00d73ce2fbc134273c6b8abfe51f2ee; b8afff5ef6dda91638f71a12c04b47ae70c1639d; 10174625a5fa0348320994d31a5d51e329c75e08; c52792297ecf26f0e161004cc86667f4130b2cd3; 74698555e6575693541b0b8573e34e7393893849; 390d3b435a8073f389407e9a6e65bad9dc923413; 5d5319e1133ee105d83e07da567ee288b7851d09; 4dc5a37d61e7dbd4d3d55f8679209e022ea09473; d293befcf9afdb25f0de2f74ff12e34978455ca9; 257697c50105f0681495c625e15b75e3b95d193c; c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf; b695cb5a9718ca530aba8b2a2174657d4996d4e8; 075147bad63d8e465892f729f2876c6ecae89e84; e0cc897e18346ee423ac1675ffc9cce185622c7e; 4fc507291d5f1e65a0eba55d905373e2229df888; 0013c4d46e4e9a9ad4f69f5e294e21cbd8266e2c,bioRxiv,,
e13ed263baf07612eafee3ff9c80370dcad6e3da,Variants within the nitric oxide synthase 1 gene are associated with stroke susceptibility.,"OBJECTIVE
Animal studies have allowed important insights into the role of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes in atherosclerosis and hypertension, as well as in stroke. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the NOS1 and NOS3 genes, respectively encoding neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS), influence stroke susceptibility and outcome after a stroke event.


METHODS
We conducted a case-control association study in 551 ischemic stroke patients and 530 controls to assess the role of NOS1 and NOS3 variants in stroke susceptibility. The same genes were tested for association with stroke outcome in a subset of 431 patients.


RESULTS
Four NOS1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2293050, rs2139733, rs7308402 and rs1483757) and four haplotypes were significantly associated with stroke susceptibility after adjusting for demographic, clinical and life-style risk factors, and correcting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (SNPs: 0.004<(uncorrected)P<0.007 and 0.036<FDR q<0.048; haplotypes: 0.001<(uncorrected)P<0.010 and 0.018<FDR q<0.032). NOS1 variants were not associated with stroke outcome. We did not find any evidence for a role of the NOS3 gene in stroke susceptibility or outcome.


CONCLUSION
Our results highlight NOS1 as a susceptibility factor for stroke, but do not corroborate previous NOS3 association findings with stroke risk. nNOS is known to play a major role in atherosclerosis development and in blood flow regulation, and it is plausible that its influence in stroke may be mediated through these two main clinical risk factors.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Helena Manso"", ids = ""145257426""); list(name = ""Tiago Krug"", ids = ""48743868""); list(name = ""JoÃ£o Eduardo Chagas Sobral"", ids = ""118462650""); list(name = ""Isabel Soares de Albergaria"", ids = ""3811151""); list(name = ""Gisela Gaspar"", ids = ""145877559""); list(name = ""JosÃ© M.

44f1369aa5dd7d81f79690c7bfc54d975be5fd1c,Characterization of Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Pathways Associated with Gastric Cancer,"To explore the patterns of gene expression in gastric cancer, a total of 26 paired gastric cancer and noncancerous tissues from patients were enrolled for gene expression microarray analyses. Limma methods were applied to analyze the data, and genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed if the False Discovery Rate (FDR) value was < 0.01, P-value was <0.01 and the fold change (FC) was >2. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) categories were used to analyze the main functions of the differentially expressed genes. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, we found pathways significantly associated with the differential genes. Gene-Act network and co-expression network were built respectively based on the relationships among the genes, proteins and compounds in the database. 2371 mRNAs and 350 lncRNAs considered as significantly differentially expressed genes were selected for the further analysis. The GO categories, pathway analyses and the Gene-Act network showed a consistent result that up-regulated genes were responsible for tumorigenesis, migration, angiogenesis and microenvironment formation, while down-regulated genes were involved in metabolism. These results of this study provide some novel findings on coding RNAs, lncRNAs, pathways and the co-expression network in gastric cancer which will be useful to guide further investigation and target therapy for this disease.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hao Li"", ids = ""38383941""); list(name = ""Beiqin Yu"", ids = ""7582345""); list(name = ""Jianfang Li"", ids = ""2611610""); list(name = ""Liping Su"", ids = ""50758856""); list(name = ""Min Yan"", ids = ""143758890""); list(name = ""Jun Zhang"", ids = ""47539767""); list(name = ""Chen Li"", ids = ""145932704""); list(name = ""Zhenggang Zhu"", ids = ""35307425""); list(name = ""Bingya Liu"", ids = ""50677910"")",c84e88021f9ddb8486dd48d20c491142ca27fd69; 5ac37acfae7a757c3ab412743daf8cbadd70da29; 70ea3dae198b8eda595acef46153028de78969f9; c471d0d56bf9461152dd5cd2f7362034db340b3c; d9510198b599748b4e63ccbeeb3707d05317ce39; 42de960cb8ff695fbe1e613c8391241e852290bd; fca0dd9f290dcebf25a58858fa1bd0b82e7ff3f9; 143c49b322a6a1d6a57e6e6efdde9d7eee1d1d8b; e05a12d64af053c43ee3b2c03b3d31ac7a002167; 8489693ad7fc74a7cec34e5a68a0f8004d017a81; d8756a5ee38777736e65e4505a37ce024de282f3; 7c46d4b4a99e5882baf194ebbb0219fe562fe29a; c750747de8738539d771c95b7e30f624d33bab19; 9cab101ded3ff309e6db7942c67efb81eed9d849; 1ec66be62e1274c8cab5aec979fcac4fcd99745f; 7aee655b0f7dada44fbc9813b3d4755719e2a52c; 37a2c41c6aa10871e64185e0116bb5f6b0e9e740; 24f1545ca95fa17e0d7271838248f97ce280887f; 28db01b528c63ee52e568e22304711456f78bcd5; e86270c456331fdc3ed2b459a9bf90a6e15ed161; c98c68c775f5a62a2cc24d0fcae4e9ce5570383c; b0b0a2bcda40e0d7403635c54f1291524a1c5dde; 187dd67e4468a3f33c8f20fc3e42d448221a2791,1bfa01f05e17994c54b14b6c5de6266af6de3428; 101d197c93125b90b945bc2d913f45ad56729bb4; 9ac89f594844b9c614053e328f17757305375729; ab6477dc498f902c12f005e8b0ed9125711d5f01; 84d82b57ff9a9f037379768dae9d07e57cb3844b; d14df9d346173ce8772af1117c356f86e930f4c3; 0c70956a1210b662efc1afba0246455fdae89760; e90abed3cb91d3a0a264615b1acb14a567ec48de; 353a1bc850f5817ccd5967090c13b9be6559f5c7; adefc3abec7356cd03af32e8135bd5cb093a057f; 29058171f7efdcb2b968b5a6c2849d5894d2fd51; b3a4075e8f64bf68238451935aa0254c86864dd1; 324d00cc4842fec24519625e87a48c9242286c74; a9585f79630fe1f13e13ef0c6b18805319744112; 9bf3054b4152c92cecb1c0a6f738a91e021bbedf; e041e2a6b91fa19cdc078e378036e3ac92faf85d; 7ebdc0ec627c352837b9ad4801771ad3a3b3edea; e696b8a760f9fcce6efbc99a57ca2ab76a676d69; f80a4020b8dd8f7097bc2116d7c9d03e9ca1db9c; 08accffd13393ccb8c4310af1b5a57cd5aaaaf84; 7fb209b2a33db217b4f8990749960d6eb46105f8; 6d6df62c22ee0d9ccb776a5432d1580093d739f4; f296c07fc8d4906c469154b4a219e12a91f911a9; 363592f7c4df3ceb2aa097045f0d0b0a501d7f94; 5fcfb02076ac6b0d6b52f043c9af8c5aefc1bf2b; 383a4254c3d1bf1bd07bf3a34fddd75f50ef054a; 7e46f24ed1292770b1f1e92f9788487369eaa7a7; 7aeace2306487c5e5f3ff6711e1a5d3fc1e4c899; ff5f5c854b04363c2cf30c9d29de180092c219e1; 362ed893526c1ecc576430d897322aac62a18c9d; 122ebee8363a9d9c6bfb4d2f07b59b82a868fb8b; 36c08e32fd70054e589ce35b3d3b47e76d36eea5; 48d535304e7783172c90ddac8d4036ee5ec5dbcd; bb9cf9588fad67a1827de74cd3f06968d51f4aa5; a01b8e36facb4b50e29a4741ce15c40d3e8a0ccc; b19bda6b1f34633ee86fb3e2f1554f3d81cf57ba; ef40bff84d126fc4b32af985ce0bc4465327bcc7; eb18025c1886c6bcc9da7f4fcaa6efacb63e43eb; 6288bec2f4426ef95f51bff535efbb4408d8a2b2; e0230449d1aa6809223c408721804f7dc6e0a470; 6a4211501849e3dea47a2eefa4530278c9d624ce; 90b568006ec3c03a5c546c2a528019d74f1db567; 3e92b18eac4c33dc5378697196ee1e9b77903c7a; 9ba69cb8dbd39f9c28eae6cf4ab0f6cd14afbc54; 0bad4e19da640b36018f94336e2df2dd67f4fd88; 2b3ca103d7945c0376e024eb3efb29b53c9b9b82; d9993515cdf67c908083436fa7b0fd9de391db2b; 1f3e092bccbd096235223db56f083124ba4d8a99; e50833945a90248286152cba4c58e7e5e4ed833e; 0f592b09e33c264189410066dd9aee44f93dce25; 70e5f330f29d52de4b614074923216c4a0f1fe9f; 23ac5bb4ad9cc3891f71b49b182343e778998aa4; 10415947820d185042963aa0851618c9f541d3b8; 38faa84ae0f6a265a025993addef06d64fd2edd5; 8b902d80259eaf4ef91b0d446346519c7076f9b8; 9881b03a4cdfdbaaba414776112c56bcffb1a984; 6b2d9d3c5aea760700042f79e955a8fce8bb4542; 8a51a5930b7f672057406bd339adc7de599472d4; 8ab3a3b19c41542c95e81fa285ac1aefe3af3532,PLoS ONE,10,
77858af95cb7ecaec84144330111b15bb25d0e37,Cis and Trans Effects of Human Genomic Variants on Gene Expression,"Gene expression is a heritable cellular phenotype that defines the function of a cell and can lead to diseases in case of misregulation. In order to detect genetic variations affecting gene expression, we performed association analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) with gene expression measured in 869 lymphoblastoid cell lines of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort in cis and in trans. We discovered that 3,534 genes (false discovery rate (FDR)â€Š=â€Š5%) are affected by an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in cis and 48 genes are affected in trans. We observed that CNVs are more likely to be eQTLs than SNPs. In addition, we found that variants associated to complex traits and diseases are enriched for trans-eQTLs and that trans-eQTLs are enriched for cis-eQTLs. As a variant affecting both a gene in cis and in trans suggests that the cis gene is functionally linked to the trans gene expression, we looked specifically for trans effects of cis-eQTLs. We discovered that 26 cis-eQTLs are associated to 92 genes in trans with the cis-eQTLs of the transcriptions factors BATF3 and HMX2 affecting the most genes. We then explored if the variation of the level of expression of the cis genes were causally affecting the level of expression of the trans genes and discovered several causal relationships between variation in the level of expression of the cis gene and variation of the level of expression of the trans gene. This analysis shows that a large sample size allows the discovery of secondary effects of human variations on gene expression that can be used to construct short directed gene regulatory networks.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julien Bryois"", ids = ""5438921""); list(name = ""Alfonso Buil"", ids = ""1936987""); list(name = ""David M.

This study takes this approach a step further by applying it to voxel based DTI analysis. LDA has two other features. First, when statistically normalised data are used as input, the ai coefficients give the relative contribution of each metric to any differences between the two subject groups. Second, LDA has the possible clinical application of identifying whether a given individual belongs to the patient group (i.e. has similar brain damage) or not. This is done firstly by finding the coefficients of the linear discriminant function, ai, and then evaluating that function for a given individual. If y < 0 the subject is classified as a control; if y â‰¥ 0 the subject is classified as belonging to the patient group. When group membership is already known, as in the current study, cross-validation of the LDA classification can be made, and its predictive ability determined from the proportion of subjects successfully classified at a particular voxel. Methods In vivo data were acquired from 59 professional male boxers aged 22-31years, and 12 age-matched male control subjects. Scans were performed on two GE 1.5T MRI scanners with 22mT/m gradient strength. A quadrature head coil was used, and in all cases the slice thickness was 5 mm, with no intersection gaps. A 2D spin echo EPI acquisition was used with TE/TR = 100ms/ 12s. An acquisition matrix of 128Ã—128Ã—30 and 1.7Ã—1.7Ã—5 mm 3 voxels in 26 gradient directions with bvalues between 815 and 1152 s.mm -2 , and 6 acquisitions with no diffusion weighting, was used. Conventional univariate analyses were compared with the multivariate LDA analysis of the same dataset, using SPM2 with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons, at a level of significance of 0.05, and a minimum cluster size of 8 voxels.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Michael H.

Stress-induced Amygdala Hyperactivity Leads to Interneuron Loss and Schizophrenia-like Pathology in a Developmental Disruption Model of Schizophrenia,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference Oral Session: Cognition S75 50 Î¼g from each sample were reduced, alkylated, tryptically digested, then zip-tipped to concentrate and purify. Samples were then run for a 90-min gradient on a Thermo Scientific QExactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. Raw MS data were processed by MaxQuant software and searched against the human Uniprot database, for label free quantitation of peptides and proteins. False discovery rates (FDR) were set at 1% for both peptide and protein levels in target/decoy to minimize false positives. The match between runs feature was utilized. Results: Four hundred and sixty-four protein identifications were obtained. Samples were excluded where >30% of proteins were missing, and we used imputation, where the missingness depends upon a threshold of detection. This left 228 proteins for analysis. Of these, 21 were significantly different between responders and non-responders (p<0.05), one was FDR positive, one at trend FDR level. Pathway analysis (KEGG, David NIH) of the significant proteins determined â€œcomplement and coagulation cascadesâ€ to be the top pathway affected with six proteins from the list assigned to the pathway. These were CFI, C4A, C6, F9, VWF and SERPING1, all found to be up-regulated and with p-values ranging from 0.002 to 0.044. C6 is a constituent of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that plays a key role in the innate and adaptive immune response, while CFI belongs to the alternative pathway, C4A belongs to the classical pathway and F9 and VWF play roles in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Discussion: These data complement results by Sekar et  al., implicating excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia. Our data identifies the complement proteins in treatment response and this is also consistent with our previous findings of up-regulation of the complement pathway among those at risk of future psychotic experiences. O1.8. STRESS-INDUCED AMYGDALA HYPERACTIVITY LEADS TO INTERNEURON LOSS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE PATHOLOGY IN A DEVELOPMENTAL DISRUPTION MODEL OF SCHIZOPHRENIA Anthony Grace*,1, Felipe Gomes1, Xiyu Zhu1 1University of Pittsburgh Background: Studies of the MAM rat model of schizophrenia show that rats exhibit higher anxiety levels, greater response to stress, and amygdala hyperactivity prepubertally before the emergence of the hyperdopaminergic state later in life. Furthermore, administration of diazepam prepubertally prevents this transition. These data suggest that MAM may predispose to psychosis via increased response to environmental stressors. If this is accurate, then one would predict that sufficiently strong stressors administered to normal rats during the critical period prepubertally would lead to psychosis-like state in the adult. Methods: Rats are exposed to either 3 sessions of 1-hour restraint, 25 footshocks daily for 10  days, or both stressors delivered either at PD 31â€“40 (prepuberty) or PD 65â€“74 (adult) in intact rats and rats with prelimbic PFC (plPFC) lesions at PD25. Rats were tested for amphetamine locomotion, novel object recognition (NOR), and VTA DA neuron firing. Valproic acid (VPA) was administered to adults 5 days before and during the combined stressors to reopen the critical period. DREADD activation of the amygdala was also evaluated. Results: While individual stressors prepubertally augmented anxiety and disrupted NOR in the adult, only the combined stressors resulted in amphetamine hyperlocomotion and increased DA neuron population activity similar to the MAM rats. plPFC lesions enabled the footshock alone to lead to anxiety, NOR deficits, and the hyperdopaminergic state in the adult. Given that stress is known to impact parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the hippocampus when administered during the critical period in prepubertal rats, we tested the impact of opening the critical period in the adult rats with VPA. Normal rats given combined stressors at PD 65â€“74 showed attenuated DA neuron activity similar to that observed in depression models. However, administration of VPA caused the combined stressors to lead to the schizophrenia phenotype. This was accompanied by hippocampal hyperactivity driven by an overactive amygdala, since DREADD activation of the amygdala produced similar effects. Discussion: These data suggest that factors that increase the response to environmental stressors during the prepubertal critical period lead to activation of the stress-activated amygdala-hippocampal pathway and PV interneuron loss, which leads to the hyperdopaminergic state in the adult thought to underlie psychosis. Furthermore, re-opening the critical period in the adult makes the adult sensitive to stress-induced psychosis. This suggests that controlling the impact of stress early in life in susceptible individuals may be an effective means to circumvent the transition to psychosis later in life. O2. Oral Session: Cognition O2.1. FIRST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS PATIENTS ACROSS EUROPE DIFFER IN INTELLECTUAL QUOTIENT (IQ) AND EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS Laura Ferraro*,1, Marta Di Forti2, Caterina La Cascia1, Giada Tripoli2, Lucia Sideli1, Ilaria Tarricone3, Diego Quattrone2, Robin Murray2, Daniele La Barbera1 1University of Palermo; 2Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Kingâ€™s College London; 3Bologna University Background: Children who later develop Schizophrenia on average are more likely to present with lower IQ; this has been considered evidence for the neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia. Though, recent studies have shown that first episode psychosis patients with a history of cannabis use have significantly higher premorbid and current IQ compared to those who never used it. This suggests that abnormal early neurodevelopment does not explain the aetiology of all cases of Schizophrenia, leaving space to environmental hazards. The present study aims to: investigate differences in IQ, as a marker of neurodevelopment, and in exposure to environmental risk factors in a large sample first episode psychosis patients recruited across five different European countries, in comparison with their respective control groups. Methods: We analysed data on IQ, socio-demographics and cannabis use from FEP=705 (51.1 % males) and healthy controls=1.034 (48.9 % males), as part of the European network of national schizophrenia networks studying European Gene-Environment-Interaction (EUGEI) study. Patients met ICD-10 criteria for psychosis, ascertained by using OPCRIT (McGuffin et al., 1991). The CEQmv(Di Forti et al., 2009) further modified for the EUGEI study, was used to collect data on cannabis use. We used ANOVAs where IQ was used as the outcome variable and case/control status and Country were respectively entered as independent predictors, along with other predictors. Results: Case-control status (F (1,1.484)=133.1, p<0.001) and Country (F (4, 1.484)=32.1, p<0.001) resulted in interaction in predicting IQ after controlling for gender, age, ethnicity, education, occupation relationship and living status. That means, being a case and being from France (mean IQ=73.4), Spain (mean IQ=74.6) and Italy (mean IQ=75.4) was associated with the lowest IQ (F (4,1.484)=3.7, p=0.004), compared with cases from UK (mean IQ=87.1) and Holland (mean IQ=85.5). Among controls the pattern was similar but not significant. We then grouped countries as North(UK and Holland) and South â€“ Europe (Italy, Spain, France) and we compared the presence of the main risk factors between the two groups. Both patients and controls from the northern part of Europe, were more likely to be from other ethnicities (chi2(2)=93.3, p<0.001) and living alone (chi2(2)=39.6, p<0.001) than patients and controls from the southern part, who were, for instance, more likely to be married (chi2(2)=34.1, p=0.007). There were no differences in education, nor in gender distribution between cases from the north and",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Anthony Grace"", ids = ""113970116""); list(name = ""Felipe Gomes"", ids = ""150998833""); list(name = ""Xiyu Zhu"", ids = ""46875201"")",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,44,S75 - S75
ba2dc9236a693858a7fecba9eeca9a6793978fdb,Mechanical force prolongs acute inflammation via T-cell-dependent pathways during scar formation.,"Mechanical force significantly modulates both inflammation and fibrosis, yet the fundamental mechanisms that regulate these interactions remain poorly understood. Here we performed microarray analysis to compare gene expression in mechanically loaded wounds vs. unloaded control wounds in an established murine hypertrophic scar (HTS) model. We identified 853 mechanically regulated genes (false discovery rate <2) at d 14 postinjury, a subset of which were enriched for T-cell-regulated pathways. To substantiate the role of T cells in scar mechanotransduction, we applied the HTS model to T-cell-deficient mice and wild-type mice. We found that scar formation in T-cell-deficient mice was reduced by almost 9-fold (P < 0.001) with attenuated epidermal (by 2.6-fold, P < 0.01) and dermal (3.9-fold, P < 0.05) proliferation. Mechanical stimulation was highly associated with sustained T-cell-dependent Th2 cytokine (IL-4 and IL-13) and chemokine (MCP-1) signaling. Further, T-cell-deficient mice failed to recruit systemic inflammatory cells such as macrophages or monocytic fibroblast precursors in response to mechanical loading. These findings indicate that T-cell-regulated fibrogenic pathways are highly mechanoresponsive and suggest that mechanical forces induce a chronic-like inflammatory state through immune-dependent activation of both local and systemic cell populations.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Victor W.

One common goal of microarray data analysis is to detect differentially expressed genes while controlling the false discovery rate. This dis-sertation consists with four papers written to address this goal. The dissertation is organized as follows: In Chapter 1, a brief introduction of the Affymetrix GeneChip microarray technology is provided. The concept of differentially expressed genes and the definition of the false discovery rate are also introduced. In Chapter 2, a literature review of the related works on this matter is provided. In Chapter 3, a t-mixture model based method is proposed to detect differentially expressed genes. In Chapter 4, a t-mixture model based false discovery rate estimator is proposed to overcome several problems of the current empirical false discovery rate estimators. In Chapter 5, a two-step false discovery rate estimation procedure is proposed to correct the over-estimation of the false discovery rate caused by differentially expressed genes. In Chapter 6, a novel estimator is developed to estimate the proportion of equivalently expressed genes, which is an important component of the false discovery rate estimators. In Chapter 7, a summary of the dissertation will be given along with some possible directions for the future work. 3 Acknowledgements The completion of this dissertation is impossible without the support from many people.

117cd3dea975367e1f672184255de218043429e6,Cross-sector fund performance comparison: the role of real estate mutual funds,"We firstly examine the performance of active sector funds as a whole as equal- and value-weighted portfolios, against a stock market benchmark (Carhart four-factor model), an associated sector market benchmark, and the combined five-factor model benchmarks. We consider the gross and net returns to show the impact of expenses on performance. We also employ the residual bootstrap approach for portfolios to separate genuine skills from luck. We also look into individual sector fund managers, to examine the proportion of truly skilled sector fund managers after false discoveries have been controlled using false discovery rate (FDR) approach. Among all 13 sectors, most sector fund managers on average cannot add enough to cover expenses irrespective of benchmarks. We find mediocre performance on real estate mutual funds (REMFs), comparing with funds of other sectors. Weak evidence of outperformance relative to sector index is found in sectors of gold, and consumer services, even after deduction of expenses. Healthcare and technology sectors, as a whole, can marginally beat the stock market. When the combined sector and stock market benchmark is employed, funds of health care and technology oriented sectors overall can still outperform after costs. Finally, at each sector fund level, we implement joint test to control false discoveries from false positive-alpha funds, and find limited proportion of skilled sector fund managers, after costs.",2014,Business,"list(name = ""Yuan Zhao"", ids = ""51456536"")",,,,,

To identify additional LOAD risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 492 LOAD cases and 498 cognitive controls using Illumina's HumanHap550 beadchip. An additional 238 cases and 220 controls were used as a validation data set for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met genome-wide significance. To validate additional associated SNPs (p < 0.0001) and nominally associated candidate genes, we imputed SNPs from our GWAS using a previously published LOAD GWAS(1) and the IMPUTE program. Association testing was performed with the Cochran-Armitage trend test and logistic regression, and genome-wide significance was determined with the False Discovery Rate-Beta Uniform Mixture method. Extensive quality-control methods were performed at both the sample and the SNP level. The GWAS confirmed the known APOE association and identified association with a 12q13 locus at genome-wide significance; the 12q13 locus was confirmed in our validation data set. Four additional highly associated signals (1q42, 4q28, 6q14, 19q13) were replicated with the use of the imputed data set, and six candidate genes had SNPs with nominal association in both the GWAS and the joint imputated data set. These results help to further define the genetic architecture of LOAD.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gary W. Beecham"", ids = ""3527605""); list(name = ""Eden R.

ced6d06710031f2264d8048bd5ddc6e231b61f00,Elevated Vanin1 and Advillin Expression Is Associated with Progression to Chronic ITP in Children,"The majority of pediatric ITP patients recover spontaneously within 6 months (acute ITP), while about 20% of the patients develop chronic ITP. The ability to distinguish patients at higher risk of developing chronic disease during the acute phase of the illness could give prognostic information and serve as a basis for clinical trials to study earlier or more aggressive interventions to prevent morbidity associated with long-term immunosuppression. We have previously described the gene expression pattern of pediatric ITP patients. This data set was used to search for genes which would predict progression to chronic ITP. We identified 8 samples from patients with acute self-limited ITP and 4 samples from patients who progressed to chronic ITP, all tested during the acute phase of the disease. At a false discovery rate of 0, two genesâ€”VNN1 (vanin1) and AVIL (advillin) were the most significantly different between the groups. To validate these findings from microarray analysis, real-time PCR experiments were performed using unamplified whole blood RNA from the original cohort, with 4 additional patients (for a total of 9 samples in self-limited acute ITP group and 7 samples in progressed to chronic ITP group), and a control group of 5 normal children. All real-time data was normalized to housekeeping gene (GADPH) expression. Both VNN1 and AVIL expression were significantly increased in the group which developed chronic ITP compared to patients with acute self-limited ITP (VNN1 p=0.008, AVIL p=0.006) and normal controls (VNN1 p=0.044, AVIL p=0.009). Table 1 shows the medians and ranges of the normalized real-time PCR results of the three groups. The mechanism of these over-expressed genes in pediatric ITP patients who progress to chronic ITP is currently being investigated. VNN1 is a GPI anchored protein involved in T cell trafficking and has a pro-inflammatory role as an oxidative-stress response gene. AVIL, whose gene product is a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin regulatory proteins, is involved in monocyte/macrophage phagocytosis and cytoskeletal remodeling. Thus both of these genes have functions consistent with recent reports implicating T cell regulation and trafficking as well as immune-mediated destruction of platelets in chronic ITP. These findings represent the first candidate biomarkers in predicting prognosis in pediatric ITP and at the same time open the door for further investigation of the molecular mechanism underlying the clinical transition from acute to chronic ITP. A prospective study to validate these findings is in progress.

891282f638285af252ca4c93aec7b2740079e82e,Lipidomic Signatures and Associated Transcriptomic Profiles of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common histological type of adult kidney cancer. In this study, we obtained lipidomic profiles of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), a major RCC subtype, by performing a lipidomic analysis of specimens of cancerous tissue and the surrounding normal renal cortex obtained from the same patients (Nâ€‰=â€‰49). We also compared the lipidomic profiles with the lipogenic transcriptome of specimens of cancerous tissue and the surrounding normal renal cortex for an additional set of patient samples (Nâ€‰=â€‰95). Overall, we detected 326 lipids, including phospholipids, sphingolipids, neutral lipids, and eicosanoids. The levels of more than 70% of the detected lipids were significantly different (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01, corrected by the false discovery rate). The cancerous tissue was distinguished by higher levels of ether-type phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and triacylglycerols, as well as by lower levels of phospholipids (except for phosphatidylcholines) and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Characteristic changes in the levels of mRNAs and metabolites suggested that the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis pathway is suppressed in ccRCC and associated with cell proliferation. The present study represents the lipidomic profiles of ccRCC, which provides novel information about the metabolic changes in renal cancerous tissue and RCC pathophysiology.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kosuke Saito"", ids = ""144871975""); list(name = ""Eri Arai"", ids = ""3278858""); list(name = ""Keiko Maekawa"", ids = ""92201781""); list(name = ""Masaki Ishikawa"", ids = ""3318897""); list(name = ""Hiroyuki Fujimoto"", ids = ""32628344""); list(name = ""Ryo Taguchi"", ids = ""49341812""); list(name = ""Kenji Matsumoto"", ids = ""145196690""); list(name = ""Yae Kanai"", ids = ""6298390""); list(name = ""Yoshiro Saito"", ids = ""1925336"")",dbf3f28109042e554e9e01ec80e5149b4549d343; ba68c2ee467b407e641446afb2b5a948fbb7b896; bcc57fb0d4bd3179b8bfa5bc6905f8903dab292b; b68bd821764f571d1b426d25f1f0faa17f160aa0; dd382303c8afc4ea37f1baf3a41b275e516536ca; b2a73d7cbbb753d635bc56affec5bfbded7ec41b; 43af71635ad3b9ae0e1b6fd33bf7eed3c4eb6528; a4b97ef889fa71e846803142f926f7012ec855cc; 5155244a998cad8c6ee4ce5b3a0413bd69d73e56; 8b8b18ed7b0987a80c364b5450051bb399c811d6; b13803c1f2c81027d08f23b675736669b10d48ac; cf078dc252e7b312a6db1c96312253420d126fe4; be464e6aeccdd24b26a010a4c39f76b5b834a5fe; 6a04341999d0e918d4720bae6be8ce0196fcb9e0; 27e70f35796013b429b3ccf420da77fc78c5e440; ad5a48da4e2085cdd065c2d70f09def9889cc024; 24e63303959d5dcf5cb431f918de8d2fad94d8fe; 1806c46ce5be11d1f834e356a415ed344f85c33d; 341982016c895596bec2cabb384a7cc9e6bf63f0; 5877626cd58492fa9ca3c925d57fde73dbdf83d7; 1e1698cf45f23344ffd16b24751bea8073cc32c4; 396b85d3f14ace23419be018605019ecd1b2a222; 6ddd8b5ae4218a9bde7dd8ad848c6f63afc54e24; 0450c9440cdbe15738d34d27e6e203c15d36a5c1; 5d0e2f3deec9bd451aee3175a6910e0a1b83f708,0f6dd5916cd654551ba51b1eb8b3f6146e5a5e15; a2b73bb0fcc5e4a447d27f6936c0ac30d1ac461d; 3c027dcbadbbe9c2902a2c593d45c5df53c8986d; 5fdfe1e54594b33547c84bed707c84fd18750a7a; 7e8f3d9e24948357f8d124e450cc638cb6cbe030; f93133614a84ff209851159b26ecaeddf61a67e3; edcf6085466c862e4932c4a1dba347246077e240; 9d1705c16e37133f1d7a6bc396ad716e67bfc3aa; 1df226162b5aebd77a8e5fb35b9399446160e946; 6c188a9a5f9a9a508f6f2752ad8bf80007d49cae; 0d53f8a1045e3534a9b90616a8b75e1962693c1f; f7c32d90425044ede299d6dd63ac862d41134711; 012e6e5079d93e52f04d6f50334d60af0f3f1ee0; 8cc314427e63f228100a6af572aa15ba2de4f234; f661527ffa08f86d43ccff7c9872534fd0eb2d55; 68c68abe423cd36c7701675bf32333188656635e; dd8b13e2c5e1cd1d78228997dc0c2e5ead293667; fa821a9051855498709fae9899a6233454287cc5; 1f5fad0ea25481b09423a991e5007b997ca78859; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 50b64f4b283bc33cc02f3fb29840970072338ea1; 20be751263548f365e30d6b5b6612074a33ccf44; 3125abdd37bc6f9c9338fc2c04e716a064da1073; 00c0e97ecd7bbe65260771c2da88dfc245625fea; 8ac5d66fdc1eb54dfd3d99aa68e97f0e1b1fec42; e9dc3a43c91270655499f352cb3525ba70f5e9c7; 7d7d0055aba29a53502f74e21b220edbeb55deac; b4916d895d8776aa036c4ddd103f408d5a1ebe39; c7f2d8eefa5a149bd5ecd381115d538a547e5dc8; bebf5e092c47f6d21125af2c74a24333aee1bc12; c8f702feaf3003e91ded0f2d7639712602fe9443; 924fd3e8036353433f4f86274982b01a84a3e3b8; c3409578e778e21f4f0f3a94889e498ba5869d19; c78598ff95d7e08c3fee8801de878d68e75f77d4; 25793259a06ee170f5fd3204a23d01173467d745; b07401a33768b7b9af96bcf9e146b382cb26984f; f1c9f704e578bac1a58d2a7cea968c7b604ddd2a; 90e9179032d3b3eb4e799a5614327ed5eeca9dd3; 1725e32b18073781def06391714e92cdd0bab8b6; 7acff1ff968c02e21edfdbb0c42e6356dfe4cf6b; 5ebd7c4709bce0dd93ea1a3635bc2fcb49536fa0; 488ea4a8225581a3b8a63876c80133077a18c8be,Scientific Reports,6,
79612c895e445881cfaf17401f20fb7c9a239f9a,Accounting for unobserved covariates with varying degrees of estimability in high dimensional experimental data,"An important phenomenon in high dimensional biological data is the presence of unobserved covariates that can have a significant impact on the measured response. When these factors are also correlated with the covariate(s) of interest (i.e. disease status), ignoring them can lead to increased type I error and spurious false discovery rate estimates. We show that depending on the strength of this correlation and the informativeness of the observed data for the latent factors, previously proposed estimators for the effect of the covariate of interest that attempt to account for unobserved covariates are asymptotically biased, which corroborates previous observations that these estimators tend to produce inflated test statistics. We then provide an estimator that corrects the bias and prove it has the same asymptotic distribution as the ordinary least squares estimator when every covariate is observed. Lastly, we use previously published DNA methylation data to show our method can more accurately estimate the direct effect of asthma on methylation than previously published methods, which underestimate the correlation between asthma and latent cell type heterogeneity. Our re-analysis shows that the majority of the variability in methylation due to asthma in those data is actually mediated through cell composition.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Chris McKennan"", ids = ""89631523""); list(name = ""Dan L.

c9f38a3781cec2d89d54e18f03a4bcf626edde59,Characterization of data analysis methods for information recovery from metabolic 1H NMR spectra using artificial complex mixtures,"The assessment of data analysis methods in 1H NMR based metabolic profiling is hampered owing to a lack of knowledge of the exact sample composition. In this study, an artificial complex mixture design comprising two artificially defined groups designated normal and disease, each containing 30 samples, was implemented using 21 metabolites at concentrations typically found in human urine and having a realistic distribution of inter-metabolite correlations. These artificial mixtures were profiled by 1H NMR spectroscopy and used to assess data analytical methods in the task of differentiating the two conditions. When metabolites were individually quantified, volcano plots provided an excellent method to track the effect size and significance of the change between conditions. Interestingly, the Welch t test detected a similar set of metabolites changing between classes in both quantified and spectral data, suggesting that differential analysis of 1H NMR spectra using a false discovery rate correction, taking into account fold changes, is a reliable approach to detect differential metabolites in complex mixture studies. Various multivariate regression methods based on partial least squares (PLS) were applied in discriminant analysis mode. The most reliable methods in quantified and spectral 1H NMR data were PLS and RPLS linear and logistic regression respectively. A jackknife based strategy for variable selection was assessed on both quantified and spectral data and results indicate that it may be possible to improve on the conventional Orthogonal-PLS methodology in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. A key improvement of our approach consists of objective criteria to select significant signals associated with a condition that provides a confidence level on the discoveries made, which can be implemented in metabolic profiling studies.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Alexessander Couto Alves"", ids = ""7931400""); list(name = ""Jia V Li"", ids = ""33404094""); list(name = ""Isabel Garcia-Perez"", ids = ""1398261867""); list(name = ""Caroline Sands"", ids = ""7672115""); list(name = ""Coral Barbas"", ids = ""2647254""); list(name = ""Elaine Holmes"", ids = ""144335949""); list(name = ""Timothy M.

b9dffb82bf70fb36b78b42e34d284c46d7a8a1f7,On the Importance of Well-Calibrated Scores for Identifying Shotgun Proteomics Spectra,"Identifying the peptide responsible for generating an observed fragmentation spectrum requires scoring a collection of candidate peptides and then identifying the peptide that achieves the highest score. However, analysis of a large collection of such spectra requires that the score assigned to one spectrum be well-calibrated with respect to the scores assigned to other spectra. In this work, we define the notion of calibration in the context of shotgun proteomics spectrum identification, and we introduce a simple, albeit computationally intensive, technique to calibrate an arbitrary score function. We demonstrate that this calibration procedure yields an increased number of identified spectra at a fixed false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. We also show that proper calibration of scores has a surprising effect on a previously described FDR estimation procedure, making the procedure less conservative. Finally, we provide empirical results suggesting that even partial calibration, which is much less computationally demanding, can yield significant increases in spectrum identification. Overall, we argue that accurate shotgun proteomics analysis requires careful attention to score calibration.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Uri Keich"", ids = ""2864261""); list(name = ""William Stafford Noble"", ids = ""144458655"")",84bf48112cac6b9fa7ad8fc4650b556abf7d13ab; c49d8627c5ed0b57619fc190202170ea8f400467; 17df1e01bc37a3580ab858ab70f8002fdbacb7f8; 784d5c09cafeaea5a8d269827ce0906c370920d3; 27822318f2c8dbf5f92a4bd31d395bcca7db45cb; 1f897420cd3af1e0f183740cbf91938a8c8f0e38; 3de72c392256efc0524ef308d93cc939721fbada; 7668060b8205d67b3cf27be86771a3f2b1cf9ef7; a79437b5eb96ab23b57c5c9765cdf99f8eb207d1; a95c6a300cb58bdbfe7cd1f239b04fd4cf5abc50; 063f62515718b8aa02e548258fcb397fd9c829d2; fe7cde06c4af9b58915f9f675156adef60297ec2; a49a77127db546f6060e31e624953fe6eff99318,abb87df03afbab087a59c5ff24aabd3a0e194503; 0d7ba2f3111674bc3957d51188768b76387a2f1a; cb84bccc93b19f5b90cfe8e719fe67e4db0c5149; 3d744cf9d758aa51e47a946af4447daf26cec1d6; c90be9508cd2c56d6e04c6c708fe8a866639a1be; 6544a071b7896f654d38d9b7b3e5404436c34f60; 3dd9d4acf562f930bcbcb1e4b528bf2922f010de; 1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; bb7dd15bd2e6d008443c2546db77b63a01d57bbd; 8bcc83b75eb2b9aa74991677c89262dd1b6bf67f; 958005b26767ea3c2661487222758a1eac162331; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; ca1ed8fd9ba9683108d7cf61ef31aff50b2eb293; cc9566cf1e4baa3607af9463b69e3299ea5401d9; 88d6d2bb9fc996dd479ce98ddd6ad47d92c5b959; 3dec9156722f58775a7de0781f333c37f62a6dd1; 192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; fa39fb914d6c8eea01ef04ae5953e170010928fa; 927f5c4281fb4af2d0b1fcb7ea3773f1b7e66614; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 3320d3f1e79fb734c356e0482d57f2fbb061ccfd; 0eb73a5d050e500d1b79d688c0e74303c57844bb; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 84eddbbeb8f5714e341895df681bcc463877fe8c; 067c511443cadcbdf8efbf5ae76fc664020d3442; 64c1b6c4b4b027c5b1b89023b9a135797c8098fe; b4ec761012ef5674c8a2f4d234d4b6991948f17f; 683db5f38157213aced577fb44a00c701cfe1a0a,Journal of Proteome Research,14,1147 - 1160
c985e871ea5647d070f1d2679e8ef5ce4a003ca3,Socioeconomic status predicts hemispheric specialisation of the left inferior frontal gyrus in young children,"Reading is a complex skill that is not mastered by all children. At the age of 5, on the cusp of prereading development, many factors combine to influence a child's future reading success, including neural and behavioural factors such as phonological awareness and the auditory processing of phonetic input, and environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES). We investigated the interactions between these factors in 5-year-old children by administering a battery of standardised cognitive and linguistic tests, measuring SES with a standardised scale, and using fMRI to record neural activity during a behavioral task, rhyming, that is predictive of reading skills. Correlation tests were performed, and then corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. It emerged that only one relationship linking neural with behavioural or environmental factors survived as significant after FDR correction: a correlation between SES and the degree of hemispheric specialisation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a region which includes Broca's area. This neural-environmental link remained significant even after controlling for the children's scores on the standardised language and cognition tests. In order to investigate possible environmental influences on the left IFG further, grey and white matter volumes were calculated. Marginally significant correlations with SES were found, indicating that environmental effects may manifest themselves in the brain anatomically as well as functionally. Collectively, these findings suggest that the weaker language skills of low-SES children are related to reduced underlying neural specialisation, and that these neural problems go beyond what is revealed by behavioural tests alone.",2008,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Rajeev D.

9558ac15501cedb2382274e4012543e194a81740,Identification of the transcripts associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in individuals co-infected with HIV and HCV,"BackgroundInfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) influences the outcome and natural disease progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. While the majority of HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected subjects develop chronic HCV infection, 20â€“46% of mono- and co-infected subjects spontaneously clear HCV infection. The mechanism underlying viral clearance is not clearly understood. Analysis of differential cellular gene expression (mRNA) between HIV-infected patients with persistent HCV infection or spontaneous clearance could provide a unique opportunity to decipher the mechanism of HCV clearance.MethodsPlasma RNA from HIV/HCV co-infected subjects who cleared HCV and those who remained chronically infected with HCV was sequenced using Ion Torrent technology. The sequencing results were analyzed to identify transcripts that are associated with HCV clearance by measuring differential gene expression in HIV/HCV co-infected subjects who cleared HCV and those who remained chronically infected with HCV.ResultsWe have identified plasma mRNA, the levels of which are significantly elevated (at least 5 fold, False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05) before HCV infection in subjects who cleared HCV compared to those who remained chronically infected. Upon further analysis of these differentially expressed genes, before and after HCV infection, we found that before HCV infection 12 genes were uniquely upregulated in the clearance group compared to the chronically infected group. Importantly, a number of these 12 genes and their upstream regulators (such as CCL3, IL17D, LBP, SOCS3, NFKBIL1, IRF) are associated with innate immune response functions.ConclusionsThese results suggest that subjects who spontaneously clear HCV may express these unique genes associated with innate immune functions.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yue Chen"", ids = ""1990636""); list(name = ""Chengli Shen"", ids = ""6529722""); list(name = ""Debjani Guha"", ids = ""50472376""); list(name = ""Ming Ding"", ids = ""145573470""); list(name = ""Scott M.

106e00117accdd5178c353dd0a97aecf03292187,A robust grey wolf-based deep learning for brain tumour detection in MR images,"Abstract In recent times, the detection of brain tumours has become more common. Generally, a brain tumour is an abnormal mass of tissue where the cells grow uncontrollably and are apparently unregulated by the mechanisms that control cells. A number of techniques have been developed thus far; however, the time needed in a detecting brain tumour is still a challenge in the field of image processing. This article proposes a new accurate detection model. The model includes certain processes such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Particularly, two extreme processes such as contrast enhancement and skull stripping are processed under the initial phase. In the segmentation process, we used the fuzzy means clustering (FCM) algorithm. Both the grey co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) as well as the grey-level run-length matrix (GRLM) features were extracted in the feature extraction phase. Moreover, this paper uses a deep belief network (DBN) for classification. The optimized DBN concept is used here, for which grey wolf optimisation (GWO) is used.

We hypothesize that associating biomarker measurements with electronic health record (EHR) populations based on shared genetic architectures would establish the clinical epidemiology of the biomarker. We use Bayesian sparse linear mixed modeling to calculate SNP weightings for 53 biomarkers from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. We use the SNP weightings to computed predicted biomarker values in an EHR population and test associations with 1139 diagnoses. Here we report 116 associations meeting a Bonferroni level of significance. A false discovery rateÂ (FDR)-based significance threshold reveals more known and undescribed associations across a broad range of biomarkers, including biometric measures, plasma proteins and metabolites, functional assays, and behaviors. We confirm an inverse association between LDL-cholesterol level and septicemia risk in an independent epidemiological cohort.

While the two first inferences are done by using a variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm, the graph inference is done by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), that is, the average proportion of errors among the edges declared significant, and by maximizing the true discovery rate (TDR), that is, the average proportion of edges declared significant among the true edges. Provided that the VEM algorithm provides reliable parameter estimates and clustering, we theoretically show that our procedure does control the FDR while satisfying an optimal TDR property, up to remainder terms that become small when the size of the graph grows. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms the classical FDR controlling methods that ignore the underlying SBM topology. In addition, these simulations demonstrate that the FDR/TDR properties of our method are robust to model mis-specification, that is, are essentially maintained outside our model.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Tabea Rebafka"", ids = ""47947322""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456""); list(name = ""Fanny Villers"", ids = ""1907804"")",b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964,d30727851607c3ed98a563e0d21454b907544ffa; 58a3c954ebef4a61877bb8aa3888255b1edc017e; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 7d254b08d7d580f2c4889ded5bd5fdbabc2a3910; acd7d08468e6dd7234d474860ab64d5a33cacfdc; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 5006e66095e3a42634e5ee4de59f10220c204778; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; 19b0c1c501abcf09e396602da00217964b407afc; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; bcd31f26f3cb55b1181c0dcc4d83c4e1d2ef056c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 996263c3ddbb50f0198354827445abd214f83030; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 55e303bcc040b7864543c075cf7ee9368efb22b3; 2bc6e9abc36aa47d33a51c6cdf307c251a419179; 398ff09f1ef9fdc1d70f59eeb744f06c06998528; 01d29333c168998ed7eddc0b16084d49092caa13; 81b8cb18a6e22b26123c431ed79f8cc98347f0d4; 3164599f45fe28f39fc7a01e9e66dd645b0b5f7e; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 9989f4ec10adaae0357638f5e06e441d118b5b4b; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 8c050fe179f709922e7becfe7af435c2ef31eed8; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 2c6ece06ff09583d8192c70aad8efe007007461f; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; bce1b1140472a45ca4864c1cade951ccc9893291; 45d0aa676a7418eab6dbeb33ec3908709b7dc79b; 2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; f8d9561c5586c2b6924ca949bc115367d2d3c93e; eda90bd43f4256986688e525b45b833a3addab97; a990d6a91a7a1c0a11dafc34753b9af143c1de56; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; e1dd7aab4aaa38940fd26f357e78f90099c8c112; b0effc6ae252a3d34b55fd77c6d883e8072695d2,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
28d49de6c28f8fd9ba958106fe06f6db0ee553b6,Abstract B34: Antitumor activity and sensitivity evaluation of novel BET inhibitors in neuroblastoma,"Children with neuroblastoma exhibit marked variability in outcome based on age at diagnosis, disease stage and tumor biologic characteristics. Genomic amplification of MYCN is a potent oncogenic driver and negative prognostic marker in neuroblastoma patients. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify therapeutic agents that target MYCN gene expression. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are epigenetic regulators known to control expression of genes involved in cell growth and oncogenesis. Previous reports demonstrate that BET inhibition (BETi) significantly attenuates cellular proliferation in numerous cancer models, perhaps via modulation of the MYC and/or MYCN oncogenes. Here, we show that potent BET inhibition induces anti-tumor effects in preclinical neuroblastoma models. Specifically, GSK726 and GSK762 (GlaxoSmithKline) were used for in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo therapeutic studies, respectively. Neuroblastoma cell lines (n=22) were treated with GSK726 to calculate IC50 values in a luminescence-based cell viability assay and differential sensitivity was observed with an IC50 range of 27 nM to 9.5 ÂµM. In sensitive cell lines, cell cycle distribution and induction of apoptosis were also measured. In these cell lines, GSK726 treatment resulted in MYCN depletion, G1 arrest within 24 hours, and apoptosis as measured by cleaved-PARP. To assess in vivo efficacy, GSK762 was subcutaneously administered in xenograft models and in genetically engineered neuroblastoma mouse models overexpressing MYCN and MYCN/ALK F1174L in the neural crest. In both models, GSK762 treatment resulted in tumor growth delay. Further assessment of results seen in vitro and in vivo indicated that MYCN amplification status did not fully predict sensitivity to GSK726 or GSK762. Thus, to determine additional biomarkers of sensitivity, we examined baseline gene expression data at the extremes of IC50 values by comparing sensitive (n=6; IC50 940 nM) neuroblastoma cell lines. Gene expression data from the neuroblastoma cell lines generated on HuGene1.0ST expression microarrays (Affymetrix) were utilized, and data were analyzed using the Limma package in R/Bioconductor. Univariate analysis, with a false discovery rate less than 0.25, revealed 6 genes (PTER, PCDHB14, RFTN1, JAK2, MYCBP, and DACH1) that were differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cell lines in the MYCN amplified setting. While all 6 genes predicted BETi sensitivity in the MYCN-amplified subset of cell lines, only DACH1 expression predicted sensitivity to BET inhibition irrespective of MYCN amplification status (p=7.92x10-7). In addition, high DACH1 expression was correlated with poor patient outcome (p=1.74x10-5). As a result, high DACH1 expression serves as a candidate biomarker for future studies with respect to sensitivity to BETi. Ultimately, these studies will help to optimize the clinical utility of BETi in neuroblastoma and perhaps other MYC-driven malignancies. Citation Format: Jason R. Healy, Robert W. Schnepp, Lori S.

627a733266956c808a5a9c17d1ae4bbb9bd1835b,Increased expression of fatty acid binding protein 4 and leptin in resident macrophages characterises atherosclerotic plaque rupture,"OBJECTIVE
Resident macrophages play an important role in atheromatous plaque rupture. The macrophage gene expression signature associated with plaque rupture is incompletely defined due to the complex cellular heterogeneity in the plaque. We aimed to characterise differential gene expression in resident plaque macrophages from ruptured and stable human atheromatous lesions.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We performed genome-wide expression analyses of isolated macrophage-rich regions of stable and ruptured human atherosclerotic plaques. Plaques present in carotid endarterectomy specimens were designated as stable or ruptured using clinical, radiological and histopathological criteria. Macrophage-rich regions were excised from 5 ruptured and 6 stable plaques by laser micro-dissection. Transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix microarrays. The profiles were characteristic of activated macrophages. At a false discovery rate of 10%, 914 genes were differentially expressed between stable and ruptured plaques. The findings were confirmed in fourteen further stable and ruptured samples for a subset of eleven genes with the highest expression differences (pÂ <Â 0.05). Pathway analysis revealed that components of the PPAR/Adipocytokine signaling pathway were the most significantly upregulated in ruptured compared to stable plaques (pÂ =Â 5.4Â Ã—Â 10(-7)). Two key components of the pathway, fatty-acid binding-protein 4 (FABP4) and leptin, showed nine-fold (pÂ =Â 0.0086) and five-fold (pÂ =Â 0.0012) greater expression respectively in macrophages from ruptured plaques.


CONCLUSIONS
We found differences in gene expression signatures between macrophages isolated from stable and ruptured human atheromatous plaques. Our findings indicate the involvement of FABP4 and leptin in the progression of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture, and suggest that down-regulation of PPAR/adipocytokine signaling within plaques may have therapeutic potential.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ka Cheong Lee"", ids = ""32558415""); list(name = ""Mauro F.

Breeding for resistance is the best strategy to control the disease and break the transmission cycle of the virus. The objectives of our study were (1) to determine genetic variation with respect to BYDV resistance in a broad germplasm set and (2) to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to genes that are involved in BYDV resistance. An association mapping population with 267 genotypes representing the worldâ€™s maize gene pool was grown in the greenhouse. Plants were inoculated with BYDV-PAV using viruliferous Rhopalosiphum padi. In the association mapping population, we observed considerable genotypic variance for the trait virus extinction as measured by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) and the infection rate. In a genome-wide association study, we observed three SNPs significantly [false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05] associated with the virus extinction on chromosome 10 explaining together 25Â % of the phenotypic variance and five SNPs for the infection rate on chromosomes 4 and 10 explaining together 33Â % of the phenotypic variance. The SNPs significantly associated with BYDV resistance can be used in marker assisted selection and will accelerate the breeding process for the development of BYDV resistant maize genotypes. Furthermore, these SNPs were located within genes which were in other organisms described to play a role in general resistance mechanisms. This suggests that these genes contribute to variation of BYDV resistance in maize.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Frederike Horn"", ids = ""26945673""); list(name = ""Antje Habekuss"", ids = ""3652102""); list(name = ""Benjamin Stich"", ids = ""5782518"")",2ccb55b96824881c715c277d2792ad4ccf38514a; 25bf884cf3848f7b5f80635bcc91e515ff4876ae; 9db6d578fa383e4e7f35121a58b6707370a8f43c,d0d3598f6c8ceda3e0a14cb6228d1489b5212e0f; c1f7fe212540ff2cbf4e4ffe9150257ec8a2ef5a; 0a417a5b09afa0eda0d037559b5ec8cee1d17e30; c1858e2ab53fc72bddacb6ab93e76100e2a6ad97; 97856f5f3b7146441bcb84ce37293b9502829c97; 0b4bc70c925ff4b7c0711254d919f1733705d2fc; 14b6d83ceff83e833dc07cdb7ee8cc117177a96f; 44704189569ef7bf121d3704515b9bd4d2473083; ffb7b8bf93f63919d2c26f2133bc1a786cd6d993; 71ec453ecc9b0a14045942cb93fa3c4c05bf8da5; d4641277a51e9105bd3ed66e2ef1c2107218b9fa; 090f0342974b00be86ca5e622325fecea43c1d23; 74f320bcec24292ee6e9fc21d5f63d52364abee7; 9bafe348eb23e053745a7de51fde7f92aab859ff; 48a12bd43d50c937a92562611148cb26f43cf4f8; 11f595d30f22869054d2da81c6ce194087e19bf4; 1ec28563eedf85fb6ab96ca2889a80e51bdacb99; 7a1fbc28278fb94d6fc00368fe080c4b4d9b8f70; bd1ef9825029655d534cff4000dd8f90ac902600; 4eff59bf10b59e3ea0a486b1307f39217ca2a88e; 5ddbd16a351147562b70a8cf842f3f73d88878ef; 573259f3e12444c83cb701f54faca5b89d6940e3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 55f34fb71dc44ba5fa9586edb7f6271bfa22f60a; 95fd7665613ebc79ca83a8916644c23f33312da8; 4548dcd7aa3e62254981387705fb8fb0f071d1e5; c03c9aecb15aa0b005ccc165b810ae6157e6913e; 4ee59bf73cbc71ab7c99ac731f1300784fa8ceaf; 9901849dda12d8117d67c5de1a33d640b20d1ff1; dfdb93ec676d0e2cfaeefae814c7cbfeaad62fd1; 1f299fa7b3884de65174c43ab75bf1b4756ac478; 3051d332da463d21d4f226429202552d2c2174a7; e77ae919af6e82de223488a47dbc7a61af9c878c; f42357a621285d1899d7ef915009dc0f6e726a21; 4dcd3d136095cf3d00ae97d2964b96f84704e66f; e82a3fe1dee29e871b7fd2d22e4232a13df25efc; ddf9c47d9b23cda2fc7018c65b11343cfb94c724; eb8b5a836929b7c6008b0e63dfdcf2fbba6b4d3f; 210b7f814e76797a38c341d5e80de5a1bbddef17; 9e07f874649ae379a96c873742f76df67b39eada; e26b2804e4d12e0391893c496d46fdbd832dd1a2; acd434f0820f1bd24d75f8096d1baf7929fda6dc; 36de2f54e90a62eb29daeb4e450f2a94759673f3; 3df31fbce754c905a5753a9af2e62bb17ef351b3; 4e546ee7c70246bdfa0e906e6288b85e164c2107; 48cb1cca8506c3a7527ac8243e84e2ce1a46c412; f3e64a1c99885acabb5193b6b297c7311d3a7e21; 8f48fc887982fad851ecb486ef0d471f3e7f3a48; 414a93cd563e85812f36ec9bf05d49445a088edd; 72eea888ed62f441311da606a47b2e08776c8b98; 6f9c87ae59fd5609fd453516d48580b5c43a45b7; ec862ab6d778422b6697e239d10377a4e03af8fd,TAG.

f1dccab0af52abaa6cf483b74151d3507ab78a63,Abstract PR13: A new high-performance HLA ligand identification strategy enables prediction of T-cell tolerance to neoepitopes,"T-cell responses against neoepitopes presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes represent a critical effector of anticancer immunity. However, detection of neoepitopes by mass spectrometry is still challenging as is identification of the fraction of neoepitopes that elicit immune responses in vitro and in vivo. To address these problems, we developed a strategy to identify HLA ligands combining the peptide identification algorithm Byonic with the epitope binding predictor netMHCpan. We obtained up to 4-fold increases in unique HLA ligand identifications compared to standard approaches, false discovery rates below 0.6% and over 17,000 unique HLA ligand identifications in a single experiment. Even with only 10 million cancer cells we were able to detect over 5,000 unique HLA ligands, which allows our approach to be applied to small tumor samples in a clinical setting. Of note, phosphorylated as well as glycosylated HLA ligands were identified with the same accuracy and allowed a better characterization of the rules for presentation of post-translationally modified HLA ligands. Furthermore, by reanalyzing mass spectrometry samples with our novel approach, we confirmed high-confidence, rejected low-confidence and identified additional neoepitopes including the first-time detection of a phosphorylated neoepitope. Finally, we used our broadened knowledge of the immunopeptidome to create rules for prediction of non-immunogenicity of neoepitopes based on high biochemical similarity with unmutated HLA ligands, which showed high specificity and positive predictive value when validated with two datasets derived from neoepitope-based clinical studies. Altogether, our methods substantially improved sensitivity and specificity for detection of native, modified and mutated HLA ligands, propose an explanation for tolerance to neoepitopes, and should in combination facilitate the design of neoepitope-based therapies.

Incorporating eQTL information hence has potential to increase power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this paper, we propose using eQTL weights as prior information in SNP based association tests to improve test power while maintaining control of the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR). We apply the proposed methods to the analysis of a GWAS for childhood asthma consisting of 1296 unrelated individuals with German ancestry. The results confirm that eQTLs are enriched for previously reported asthma SNPs. We also find that some SNPs are insignificant using procedures without eQTL weighting, but become significant using eQTL-weighted Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg procedures, while controlling the same FWER or FDR level.

cff0df5c04e554cf04dd2d8925a550d8370240bd,Prediction on DNA Binding Sequence in Deep Learning Approach,"Prediction of DNA-binding proteins from sequence information is the most challenging tasks in genome annotation. The principal study of our research is to determine DNA-binding proteins from primary protein sequences comparing the accuracy of the model in a deep learning based procedure. We also put the protein sequence in DNA binder tool to predict whether the sequence is DNA-Binding or non-DNA-Binding protein. We have encoded the datasets on hot encoded process and two stages of convolutional neutral network to detect the function domains of protein sequences. Our proposed method is being trained and tested with protein sequences of human and mouse, while it predicts 37% of training, 13% of testing and 50 % of the original sequences that finally count 74% of them for training and 26% of them for testing datasets of DNA-Binding proteins. The proposed method achieves a prediction accuracy of 70.50 %, sensitivity of 62.32%, specificity of 78.27% and the Matthew's correlation coefficient at 1. Support vector machine and logistic regression classifier are used upon our method to increase the accuracy. The accuracy has increased using both classifier and it raises 12% and 9% respectively. We have also count prediction analysis of precision, recall, f-measure and false discovery rate of the protein sequence.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""L Pinky Mm Islam Mm Rahman T Akter"", ids = ""120143741""); list(name = ""Alimagboul A.

In mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data, features can be measured at different levels of reliability and false features are often detected in untargeted metabolite profiling as chemical and/or bioinformatics noise. The traditional false discovery rate methods treat all features equally, which can cause substantial loss of statistical power to detect differentially expressed features. We propose a reliability index for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data with repeated measurements, which is quantified using a composite measure. We then present a new method to estimate the local false discovery rate (lfdr) that incorporates feature reliability. In simulations, our proposed method achieved better balance between sensitivity and controlling false discovery, as compared to traditional lfdr estimation. We applied our method to a real metabolomics dataset and were able to detect more differentially expressed metabolites that were biologically meaningful.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Y.

b572048c87e697eceef0a73f0f07bf71a5a4d326,Procedures controlling generalized false discovery rate,"Procedures controlling error rates measuring at least k false rejections, instead of at least one, can potentially increase the ability of a procedure to detect false null hypotheses in situations where one seeks to control k or more false rejections having tolerated a few of them. The k-FWER, which is the probability of at least k false rejections and generalizes the usual familywise error rate (FWER), is such an error rate that is recently introduced in the literature and procedures controlling it have been proposed. This paper considers an alternative and less conservative notion of error rate, the k-FDR, which is the expected proportion of k or more false rejections among all rejections and generalizes the usual notion of false discovery rate (FDR). Procedures with the k-FDR control dominating the Benjamini-Hochberg stepup FDR procedure and its stepdown analog under independence or positive dependence and the Benjamini-Yekutieli stepup FDR procedure under any form of dependence have been constructed.",2006,,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

97d37061000cc6c8c99e3a89ffe116bd630181d8,Beta-Catenin and N-Cadherin in Myeloma: Implications for Adhesion and Migration.,"Increasing evidence suggests that altered Wnt signaling plays an important role in myelomagenesis. We recently discovered that myeloma plasma cells secrete soluble inhibitors of Wnt signaling and these prevent osteoblast differentiation and contribute to development of osteolytic lesions. We have also shown that myeloma plasma cells are capable of activating both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways and that this primarily induces morphological changes, invasion and migration through non-canonical signaling. As beta-catenin is the primary effector of canonical Wnt signaling, we investigated the potential role of beta-catenin in primary myeloma. Although beta-catenin can be stabilized upon Wnt-3A treatment of both primary myeloma cells and myeloma cells lines, we were unable to note any effects on proliferation or activation of beta-catenin-TCF targets genes. Western blotting of protein extracts from plasma cells from 69 newly diagnosed cases showed highly variable levels of stable beta-catenin. Using SAM analysis with a 1% false discovery rate we correlated beta-catenin levels with global gene expression levels in these 69 samples and found that high beta-catenin levels were strongly correlated with expression of only a single gene, the neural adhesion molecule N-cadherin ( CDH2 ). Microarray analysis on a large panel of normal and malignant B-cells showed that CDH2 expression was unique to myeloma plasma cells and that CDH2 was expressed highest in hyperdiploid and FGFR3 / MMSET -positive cases. As expected CDH2 expression was high in in-vitro-expanded mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts and CD34-selected stem cells. In-vitro derived osteoclasts from myeloma patients and normal donors did not express CDH2 . N-cadherin was immunoprecipitated from 8 primary myeloma cells and 6 myeloma cell lines and resolved by SDS-PAGE and N-cadherin and beta-catenin were detected in immunoprecipitation complexes following immunoblotting. Moreover, beta-catenin and N-cadherin protein levels showed a high degree of correlation on western blots. Flow cytometery of N-cadherin expression on primary samples showed heterogeneous expression with as little as 15% and as much as 77% of CD38+/CD45âˆ’ plasma cells expressing the protein. OPM2, JJN3, and ARP1 myeloma cell lines, which express different levels of N-cadherin, were treated with the N-cadherin neutralizing antibody GC-4 and the cells subjected to the transendothelial migration assay. Maximum inhibition was observed for JJN3 cells, with 60% inhibition at 24 hrs, while OPM2 had an intermediate level of inhibition (40%) and ARP1, the only N-cadherin negative line, underwent transendothelial migration as efficiently as control cells. These data suggests that functional adherns junctions of beta-catenin and N-cadherin likely exist on myeloma plasma cells and these junctions may play a role in myeloma biology that centers on cell adhesion and migration and possibly cell-cell communication.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Fenghuang Zhan"", ids = ""1784631""); list(name = ""Simona Colla"", ids = ""3923755""); list(name = ""Ya-wei Qiang"", ids = ""4229646""); list(name = ""Owen W.

A standard thresholding rule flags an observation as a possible signal if it exceeds âˆš 2 log n. We show that with this canonical cutoff, the false discovery rate as well as the true discovery rate converge in probability to zero. If we adjust the thresholding sequence suitably, the number of false discoveries admits nontrivial Poisson asymptotics instead of collapsing to zero; in exchange, this improves the true discovery rate by a factor of a log power. If we sharpen the threshold sequence even further, we can force the false discovery rate to converge in probability to a prespecified number strictly between 0 and 1, and in return, this allows us to pick up as much as 50% of all the signals that are present. This is in contrast to the canonical âˆš 2 log n cutoffâ€™s case, for which we are bound to lose all the signals asymptotically in exchange for a zero false discovery rate. This article precisely pins down what the thresholds must be in order to deliver the userâ€™s demand on the discovery rate and the false discovery rate.

We used a PD genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis data of the genotypes of 2,525,705 SNPs in 4,238 PD cases and 4,239 controls. Identify candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis was applied to the PD GWAS dataset. The first stage involved the pre-selection of candidate causal SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis and the functional SNP annotation of the most significant SNPs found. The second stage involved the annotation of biological mechanisms for the pre-selected candidate causal SNPs using improved-gene set enrichment analysis.

Using STAR (Dobin et al., Bioinformatics, 2013. 29(1): p. 15-21) as an exemplar, we demonstrate that correcting these deficiencies makes its accuracy equal or better than that of TopHat2.

3207f6a98cebd42231793d9c1a8248fcca95231e,Optimizing RNA-seq studies to investigate herbicide resistance.,"Transcriptomic profiling, specifically via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), is becoming one of the more commonly used methods for investigating non-target site resistance (NTSR) to herbicides due to its high throughput capabilities and utility in organisms with little to no previous sequence information. A review of the weed science RNA-seq literature revealed some basic principles behind generating quality data from these types of studies. First, studies that included more replicates per biotype and took steps to control for genetic background had significantly better control of false positives and, consequently, shorter lists of potential resistance genes to sift through. Pooling of biological replicates prior to sequencing was successful in some cases, but likely contributed to an overall increase in the false discovery rate. Although the inclusion of herbicide-treated samples was common across most of the studies, it ultimately introduced difficulties in interpretation of the final results due to challenges in capturing the right sampling window after treatment and to the induction of stress responses in the injured herbicide-sensitive plants. RNA-seq is an effective tool for NTSR gene discovery, but careful consideration should be given to finding the most powerful and cost-effective balance between replicate number, sequencing depth and treatment number.

In order to detect these changes, the major step required is blood vessel segmentation. In this study, an effective method for the segmentation of blood vessels on coloured digital retinal images has been proposed. The proposed method uses linear combination of line detectors at varying scales along with multiple windows of different sizes. By implementing this technique, the drawbacks encountered in multi-scale line detection such as noise and false vessel detection around the optic disk are eliminated. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on three publicly available datasets DRIVE, STARE and CHASE by considering sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, false discovery rate, F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient and G-mean. The results were analysed by comparing with most of the other earlier existing methods and have proven to achieve higher accuracy.

f255f7d36d0c1072e1653bd7817eecec1057935c,Multi-label Stream Classification Using Extended Binary Relevance Model,"In this paper the issue of multi-label data stream classification was addressed. To deal with the posed problem, we introduced a recognition system that is build upon a two level architecture. The first level is a Binary Relevance multi-label classifier, and the second is a correction procedure that employs competence and cross-competence measures to adjust the output of the Binary Relevance classifier. The measures are calculated in a lazy manner using a local, fuzzy confusion matrix which is a generalized version of commonly known confusion matrix. The matrix follows the changes in the data stream by using a sliding window approach. The sliding window is implemented as a simple FIFO queue. During the experimental study the algorithm was compared against 2 state-of-the-art approaches using 12 benchmark datasets. The classification quality of the investigated model was performed using 8 different evaluation measures. The conducted the experiments revealed that the proposed method outperforms the reference methods in terms of the Hamming loss and micro-averaged False Discovery Rate.

7e504bfb29d24a97e374b90c0f9ce4bdf1bcc68b,Controlling FDR while highlighting selected discoveries,"Often modern scientific investigations start by testing a very large number of hypotheses in an effort to comprehensively mine the data for possible discoveries. Multiplicity adjustment strategies are employed to ensure replicability of the results of this broad search. Furthermore, in many cases, discoveries are subject to a second round of selection, where researchers identify the rejected hypotheses that better represent distinct and interpretable findings for reporting and follow-up. For example, in genetic studies, one DNA variant is often chosen to represent a group of neighboring polymorphisms, all apparently associated to a trait of interest. Unfortunately the guarantees of false discovery rate (FDR) control that might be true for the initial set of findings do not translate to this subset, possibly leading to an inflation of FDR in the reported discoveries. To guarantee valid inference, we introduce Focused BH, a multiple testing procedure that allows the researcher to curate rejections by subsetting or prioritizing them according to pre-specified but possibly data-dependent rules (filters). Focused BH assures FDR control on the selected discoveries under a range of assumptions on the filter and the p-value dependency structure; simulations illustrate that this is obtained without substantial power loss and that the procedure is robust to violations of our theoretical assumptions.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Eugene Katsevich"", ids = ""14144300""); list(name = ""C.

Several quantitative trait loci associated to meat pH are described on PigQTL database but only two genes influencing this parameter have been so far detected: Ryanodine receptor 1 and Protein kinase, AMP-activated, gamma 3 non-catalytic subunit. To search for genes influencing meat pH we analyzed genomic regions with quantitative effect on this trait in order to detect SNPs to use for an association study.ResultsThe expressed sequences mapping on porcine chromosomes 1, 2, 3 in regions associated to pork pH were searched in silico to find SNPs. 356 out of 617 detected SNPs were used to genotype Italian Large White pigs and to perform an association analysis with meat pH values recorded in semimembranosus muscle at about 1 hour (pH1) and 24 hours (pHu) post mortem.The results of the analysis showed that 5 markers mapping on chromosomes 1 or 3 were associated with pH1 and 10 markers mapping on chromosomes 1 or 2 were associated with pHu. After False Discovery Rate correction only one SNP mapping on chromosome 2 was confirmed to be associated to pHu. This polymorphism was located in the 3â€™UTR of two partly overlapping genes, Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and WD repeat domain 83 (WDR83). The overlapping of the 3â€™UTRs allows the co-regulation of mRNAs stability by a cis-natural antisense transcript method of regulation. DHPS catalyzes the first step in hypusine formation, a unique amino acid formed by the posttranslational modification of the protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A in a specific lysine residue. WDR83 has an important role in the modulation of a cascade of genes involved in cellular hypoxia defense by intensifying the glycolytic pathway and, theoretically, the meat pH value.ConclusionsThe involvement of the SNP detected in the DHPS/WDR83 genes on meat pH phenotypic variability and their functional role are suggestive of molecular and biological processes related to glycolysis increase during post-mortem phase. This finding, after validation, can be applied to identify new biomarkers to be used to improve pig meat quality.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paolo Zambonelli"", ids = ""2303533""); list(name = ""Roberta Davoli"", ids = ""2966099""); list(name = ""Mila Bigi"", ids = ""5355398""); list(name = ""Silvia Braglia"", ids = ""2876992""); list(name = ""Luigi Francesco De Paolis"", ids = ""5207745""); list(name = ""L.

adc2aebd1d9b543aaba6bf1232c29e693b33c00d,Abstract B39: CXCL1 as a putative tumor marker for gastric cancer progression,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a heterogeneous disease and current tumor markers are limited in its application. Therefore finding molecular markers that are able to predict the potential of tumor progression is important for appropriate individualized therapy. With the Cancer Metastasis Research Center (CMRC) microarray database (17K cDNA microarray), we identified differentially expressed genes between 96 cancer and 98 normal gastric tissues using Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM). Among them, more than 2â€fold overexpressed genes in tumor tissues which encode secreted proteins were selected. The selected gene was validated with ELISA assay using sera of 96 GC patients and 48 healthy donors. We first selected 6510 genes which were differentially expressed between 96 cancer and 98 normal gastric tissues with minimal false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.005%. Then, out of 6510 genes, we picked 386 genes which encode secreted proteins based on SOURCE database. Among 386 genes, we focused on the 55 genes overexpressed more that 2â€fold in GC compared to normal. With Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found 34 genes related to cancer. Especially, CXCL1, chemokine growthâ€regulated oncogene 1, has been known for its relation with cancer progression in various cancer type, but GC. CXCL1 levels in serum samples of GC patients were significantly elevated compared with healthy donors (p Citation Information: Mol Cancer Ther 2009;8(12 Suppl):B39.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Minkyu Jung"", ids = ""13482797""); list(name = ""Jae Joon Jung"", ids = ""31072323""); list(name = ""Se Won Noh"", ids = ""22709013""); list(name = ""Hei Cheul Jeung"", ids = ""144270797""); list(name = ""Taesoo Kim"", ids = ""46760060""); list(name = ""Hyo Song Kim"", ids = ""8186369""); list(name = ""Sung Hoon Noh"", ids = ""5735461""); list(name = ""Jae Kyung Roh"", ids = ""1914887""); list(name = ""Hyun Cheol Chung"", ids = ""49781884""); list(name = ""Sung Young Rha"", ids = ""153566061"")",,,Molecular Cancer Therapeutics,8,

Unfortunately, therapy-limiting maladaptations such as loss of treatment effect (tolerance), and paradoxical opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) can occur. The objective of this study was to identify genes responsible for opioid tolerance and OIH.ResultsThese studies used a well-established model of ascending morphine administration to induce tolerance, OIH and other opioid maladaptations in 23 strains of inbred mice. Genome-wide computational genetic mapping was then applied to the data in combination with a false discovery rate filter. Transgenic mice, gene expression experiments and immunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the functional roles of the most strongly linked gene. The behavioral data processed using computational genetic mapping and false discovery rate filtering provided several strongly linked biologically plausible gene associations. The strongest of these was the highly polymorphic Mpdz gene coding for the post-synaptic scaffolding protein Mpdz/MUPP1. Heterozygous Mpdz +/âˆ’ mice displayed reduced opioid tolerance and OIH. Mpdz gene expression and Mpdz/MUPP1 protein levels were lower in the spinal cords of low-adapting 129S1/Svlm mice than in high-adapting C57BL/6 mice. Morphine did not alter Mpdz expression levels. In addition, association of Mpdz/MUPP1 with its known binding partner CaMKII did not differ between these high- and low-adapting strains.ConclusionsThe degrees of maladaptive changes in response to repeated administration of morphine vary greatly across inbred strains of mice.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of the alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) gene polymorphisms with IS and any possible interactions between specific AMBP alleles and traditional risk factors among a Han Chinese cohort. Materials and Methods: We conducted a candidate gene study designed to characterize nine (9) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AMBP gene among 195 patients with atherothrombotic stroke (ATS) alone (a major subtype of IS) and 184 nonstroke controls. Allelic and genotypic frequency differences were evaluated using a logistic regression model. False discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was used. The interaction analyses were performed by multifactor dimensionality reduction test. Results: We found an association between the rs2567698 CC genotype (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.176, 1.159-4.086) and the T allele (OR, 95% CI: 0.654, 0.446-0.960) with risk of ATS in men. However, these associations did not survive FDR correction. In haplotype analyses, the GCCCCCCCC haplotype had a higher frequency (OR, 95% CI: 2.191, 1.048-4.580) in ATS in the â‰¥45 years of age subgroup, whereas the GCCTCCCCC haplotype decreased the risk for ATS (OR, 95% CI: 0.543, 0.345-0.853) in men. In addition, we also found interactions for ATS risk between SNPs in the AMBP gene and modifiable risk factors for ATS, including: rs11788411 and hypertension in the overall population and women; rs2251680 and hypertension in subjects aged 45 years and older, as well as the interaction among hypertension and the rs2567698 and rs10817564 genotypes in men. Conclusion: Our results show a possible association between AMBP SNP haplotypes and gene-environment interactions with ATS susceptibility in a Han Chinese cohort.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hua Xing Liu"", ids = ""121510572""); list(name = ""Danyang Luo"", ids = ""25854402""); list(name = ""Ya Ping Qiu"", ids = ""50627100""); list(name = ""Yan Huang"", ids = ""31225471""); list(name = ""Cheng Chen"", ids = ""46730036""); list(name = ""Xiaoxiao Song"", ids = ""47684358""); list(name = ""Li Gao"", ids = ""145020198""); list(name = ""Yongmei Zhou"", ids = ""46433434"")",,,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,,

Hence, the selection of suitable features is necessary as most of the raw data might be redundant or irrelevant to the recognition of patterns. In some cases, the classifier cannot perform well because of the large number of redundant features. This paper investigates the performance of different feature selection algorithms for the task of data classification. Different features play different roles in classifying datasets. Unwanted features will result in error information during classification which will reduce classification precision. The most of traditional feature selection can remove these distractions to improve classification performance. As shown in the experimental results, after feature selection using the traditional methods to control false discovery rate, the classification performance of DTâ€™s and NB classifiers were significantly improved.",2012,Computer Science,"list(name = ""S.

240c646eae5060582a42fdf3b32592d319d3ce36,Identification of ganglioside GM2 activator playing a role in cancer cell migration through proteomic analysis of breast cancer secretomes,"Cancer cell secretomes are considered a potential source for the discovery of cancer markers. In this study, the secretomes of four breast cancer (BC) cell lines (Hs578T, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3) were profiled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 1410 proteins were identified with less than 1% false discovery rate, of which approximately 55% (796 proteins) were predicted to be secreted from cells. To find BC-specific proteins among the secreted proteins, data of immunohistochemical staining compiled in the Human Protein Atlas were investigated by comparing the data of BC tissues with those of normal tissues. By applying various criteria, including higher expression level in BC tissues, higher predicted potential of secretion, and sufficient number of tandem mass spectra, 12 biomarker candidate proteins including ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) were selected for confirmation. Western blot analysis and ELISA for plasma samples of healthy controls and BC patients revealed elevation of GM2A in BC patients, especially those who were estrogen receptor-negative. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GM2A in BC cells decreased migration in vitro, whereas the overexpression of GM2A led to an increase in cell migration. Although GM2A as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in BC should be carefully verified further, this study has established the potential role of GM2A in BC progression.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jihye Shin"", ids = ""2161211""); list(name = ""Gamin Kim"", ids = ""5331555""); list(name = ""Jong Won Lee"", ids = ""2185135""); list(name = ""Ji Eun Lee"", ids = ""26067282""); list(name = ""Yoo Seok Kim"", ids = ""49170497""); list(name = ""Jonghan Yu"", ids = ""28035009""); list(name = ""Seungtaek Lee"", ids = ""6372791""); list(name = ""Sei Hyun Ahn"", ids = ""2212084""); list(name = ""Hoguen Kim"", ids = ""82609239""); list(name = ""Cheolju Lee"", ids = ""2223177"")",4ea123e44f575ea8ab44b6aeef933545d8562007; 5f32b6b865fa909dde6047cc6f67e5caa3357270; c00f6ad25a8047acb5519faa24b812f34aa21d5c; 759bb1418493ea8bbbd3906b4ca776338add662f; 4976a82e361204dca4545e03afb6ad4b0d15a045; f38dea6f2314c1efda83472bbd49c819e4a97943; d3c20cf72c9d29ca8fd2ce4c770433afe213ee90,acafef627285515c5c30cfcdaea7a32ad4f9de71; 18b0c41ab4a2ac39acb61aef2bacbc14889aedde; 65ce0c544951a5dc167878d71b324df7df6d227c; e0c706402cf6cc205a0980ee047de9fc710c6aee; 3adfd9adda95924c8d2576a981a6a3c3870b770c; 1b0c06fa4a7a525a288a4c4cd9de44340d4fc671; b411cbe2ad1b39f661d7501f68f25e1facb1eae2; 59f875758e80953c6b3b5a6e52887acb4027e8f0; d39c5248545120b429a90490019eab183813583a; c520dcd646e110218107a6276be0a153ae81b8be; edf3adb4340fa2d7edab90509a93b456dc544ec5; 5f704438916f83f38a2296b8315e87f629b69c63; 634d26716f028b926ce2eff2c26ccf8898e1e8aa; eb960b5d56ed1368991eaa4f40cb7afee66edb1f; 69dbae58d588dd2c746cdb8a9b71429645bdc37b; 589b0c74d5e250f2d51d1079b580106d914d95d8; 6111dff8bab60de5bcf322d69f8daaed085300d5; 6dab91d698466d1bb056209845fa125f005fb229; c3a4fae0c47a88f048aaf1afe24ac4c33fc375f8; a1daff142f80183253cf3cc78108238656aae0e6; c78dfabb127baff5fb132cd54e6bccf0b398aab1; b112ed9ad9d7d6e7d28205e0d1c47f1a4210f342; 085af841319f86e059306e495b60a026905386b4; 41cae20fc49724bfa21d79b7c3b3b4bb551732ce; e44b6d6439c334ae6d0b9077ce3d17d0871cf31a; f000d6a2e185442d77eec6a01e47fc3ae05639ad; 0d8044c341ce92cb8983a21c70f1caea01cef22d; 523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8; 3e24ff6f5f8eba407effc09a3e23ee583d4ee0e7; 093177546ad1a8253baebf1a08de386405171454; 0fcb0f9b93c556a59872bf9cb709bfcaf6f38b9f; 2588dd794195f58466ca9216e7576ff3b5211642,Cancer Science,107,828 - 835

Although a variety of methods have been developed to elevate protein annotation accuracy, their ability in controlling false annotation rates remains either limited or not systematically evaluated. In this study, a protein encoding strategy, together with a deep learning algorithm, was proposed to control the false discovery rate in protein function annotation, and its performances were systematically compared with that of the traditional similarity-based and de novo approaches. Based on a comprehensive assessment from multiple perspectives, the proposed strategy and algorithm were found to perform better in both prediction stability and annotation accuracy compared with other de novo methods. Moreover, an in-depth assessment revealed that it possessed an improved capacity of controlling the false discovery rate compared with traditional methods.

Proteomic workflows based on nanoLC-MS/MS data-dependent-acquisition analysis have progressed tremendously in recent years. High-resolution and fast sequencing instruments have enabled the use of label-free quantitative methods, based either on spectral counting or on MS signal analysis, which appear as an attractive way to analyze differential protein expression in complex biological samples. However, the computational processing of the data for label-free quantification still remains a challenge. Here, we used a proteomic standard composed of an equimolar mixture of 48 human proteins (Sigma UPS1) spiked at different concentrations into a background of yeast cell lysate to benchmark several label-free quantitative workflows, involving different software packages developed in recent years. This experimental design allowed to finely assess their performances in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate, by measuring the number of true and false-positive (respectively UPS1 or yeast background proteins found as differential). The spiked standard dataset has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange repository with the identifier PXD001819 and can be used to benchmark other label-free workflows, adjust software parameter settings, improve algorithms for extraction of the quantitative metrics from raw MS data, or evaluate downstream statistical methods.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Bioinformatic pipelines for label-free quantitative analysis must be objectively evaluated in their ability to detect variant proteins with good sensitivity and low false discovery rate in large-scale proteomic studies. This can be done through the use of complex spiked samples, for which the ""ground truth"" of variant proteins is known, allowing a statistical evaluation of the performances of the data processing workflow. We provide here such a controlled standard dataset and used it to evaluate the performances of several label-free bioinformatics tools (including MaxQuant, Skyline, MFPaQ, IRMa-hEIDI and Scaffold) in different workflows, for detection of variant proteins with different absolute expression levels and fold change values. The dataset presented here can be useful for tuning software tool parameters, and also testing new algorithms for label-free quantitative analysis, or for evaluation of downstream statistical methods.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Claire Ramus"", ids = ""6204413""); list(name = ""AgnÃ¨s Hovasse"", ids = ""3786520""); list(name = ""MarlÃ¨ne Marcellin"", ids = ""3564750""); list(name = ""Anne-Marie Hesse"", ids = ""40506557""); list(name = ""Emmanuelle Mouton-Barbosa"", ids = ""1400263823""); list(name = ""David BouyssiÃ©"", ids = ""4430458""); list(name = ""Sebastian Vaca"", ids = ""134767004""); list(name = ""Christine Carapito"", ids = ""5346050""); list(name = ""Karima Chaoui"", ids = ""5518444""); list(name = ""Christophe Bruley"", ids = ""2144813""); list(name = ""JÃ©rÃ´me Garin"", ids = ""4307509""); list(name = ""Sarah CianfÃ©rani"", ids = ""4131455""); list(name = ""Myriam Ferro"", ids = ""4858307""); list(name = ""Alain Van Dorssaeler"", ids = ""1409181470""); list(name = ""Odile Burlet-Schiltz"", ids = ""1398358225""); list(name = ""Christine Schaeffer"", ids = ""34665427""); list(name = ""Yohann CoutÃ©"", ids = ""4830279""); list(name = ""Anne Gonzalez de Peredo"", ids = ""6088570"")",d7c57854c53f78682a1a3bd8be67cab829b72e53; 4259dc2f62a2a70c17e09793dc6d143154bc5aef; 1fb43316e819db59c9e13a119ca110eb973846b6; b5cec912111ff51379c3f2e506f59d071e69a2f0; 389928cfbbf9b62824b3535d7e6823623fe8a400; a0233746b2d1b812db94ade1f5ca9d3a1f5524a8; 9d77a51fd3a36dbf10583e7f10bbf3e38855a525; c87c9c29d55fa6a89194eeac3d71b63fae45ef55; 34a9d982d36afa04df540860716b3b36961b3cc7; 55fe5e0b6f1f4bb0f37c7d35fc6d2aaf37d1868a; 2c6fb339b41257078426c6c4cefb494887c3103e; a6617d187503c750a4c02861573159655e65507e; d817f21659c13c69f8c6c23ed671873f52ec8113; 3b683321af744e9a46d92caf74d3446b711d6190; c9f3a521f59a84c90c7056675f54ca0bcefe8aa3; 5502e7126d0ad962f080aed3dd50289a44c2a527; 9d4b7edb970c2922fcabb2aa189345fd31ad0b71,,Journal of proteomics,132,"

bac417ed4c655659a29b56a8a0be03d06052bd72,Transcriptional profiling of the Arabidopsis abscission mutant hae hsl2 by RNA-Seq,"BackgroundAbscission is a mechanism by which plants shed entire organs in response to both developmental and environmental signals. Arabidopsis thaliana, in which only the floral organs abscise, has been used extensively to study the genetic, molecular and cellular processes controlling abscission. Abscission in Arabidopsis requires two genes that encode functionally redundant receptor-like protein kinases, HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE 2 (HSL2). Double hae hsl2 mutant plants fail to abscise their floral organs at any stage of floral development and maturation.ResultsUsing RNA-Seq, we compare the transcriptomes of wild-type and hae hsl2 stage 15 flowers, using the floral receptacle which is enriched for abscission zone cells. 2034 genes were differentially expressed with a False Discovery Rate adjusted p < 0.05, of which 349 had two fold or greater change in expression. Differentially expressed genes were enriched for hydrolytic, cell wall modifying, and defense related genes. Testing several of the differentially expressed genes in INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (ida) mutants shows that many of the same genes are co-regulated by IDA and HAE HSL2 and support the role of IDA in the HAE and HSL2 signaling pathway. Comparison to microarray data from stamen abscission zones show distinct patterns of expression of genes that are dependent on HAE HSL2 and reveal HAE HSL2- independent pathways.ConclusionHAE HSL2-dependent and HAE HSL2-independent changes in genes expression are required for abscission. HAE and HSL2 affect the expression of cell wall modifying and defense related genes necessary for abscission. The HAE HSL2-independent genes also appear to have roles in abscission and additionally are involved in processes such as hormonal signaling, senescence and callose deposition.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chad E.

693e1736e3842a54b3a8b02d235b76f556c44781,Estimating the false discovery rate using the stochastic approximation algorithm,"Testing of multiple hypotheses involves statistics that are strongly dependent in some applications, but most work on this subject is based on the assumption of independence. We propose a new method for estimating the false discovery rate of multiple hypothesis tests, in which the density of test scores is estimated parametrically by minimizing the Kullback--Leibler distance between the unknown density and its estimator using the stochastic approximation algorithm, and the false discovery rate is estimated using the ensemble averaging method. Our method is applicable under general dependence between test statistics. Numerical comparisons between our method and several competitors, conducted on simulated and real data examples, show that our method achieves more accurate control of the false discovery rate in almost all scenarios.

By using a 1% false discovery rate for total peptide identifications, a total of 2513 distinct yeast proteins are identified from the SDS-solubilized fraction with an average of 5.4 peptides leading to each protein identification. Among proteins identified from the SDS-solubilized fraction, 407 proteins are predicted to contain at least two or more transmembrane domains using TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/), corresponding to 46% yeast membrane proteome coverage.

83d8fe4875004c7cdc88873df9facda507145b6d,Direct maximization of protein identifications from tandem mass spectra.,"The goal of many shotgun proteomics experiments is to determine the protein complement of a complex biological mixture. For many mixtures, most methodological approaches fall significantly short of this goal. Existing solutions to this problem typically subdivide the task into two stages: first identifying a collection of peptides with a low false discovery rate and then inferring from the peptides a corresponding set of proteins. In contrast, we formulate the protein identification problem as a single optimization problem, which we solve using machine learning methods. This approach is motivated by the observation that the peptide and protein level tasks are cooperative, and the solution to each can be improved by using information about the solution to the other. The resulting algorithm directly controls the relevant error rate, can incorporate a wide variety of evidence and, for complex samples, provides 18-34% more protein identifications than the current state of the art approaches.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marina Spivak"", ids = ""47327030""); list(name = ""Jason Weston"", ids = ""145183709""); list(name = ""Daniela Tomazela"", ids = ""48145608""); list(name = ""Michael J.

Early diagnosis represents one of the best lines of defense in the fight against a wide array of human diseases. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is one of the first easily available diagnostic biofluids and can inform about the health status of newborns. However, compared with adult blood, its diagnostic potential remains largely untapped.


OBJECTIVES
Our goal was to accelerate biomarker research on UCB by exploring its detectable protein content and providing a priority list of potential biomarkers based on known proteins involved in disease pathways.


METHODS
We explored cord blood serum proteins by profiling a UCB pool of 12 neonates with different backgrounds using a combination of isoelectric focusing and liquid chromatography coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS) and by comparing results with information contained in metabolic and disease databases available for adult blood.


RESULTS
A total of 1,210 UCB proteins were identified with a protein-level false discovery rate of ~ 5% as estimated by naÃ¯ve target-decoy and MAYU approaches, signifying a 6-fold increase in the number of UCB proteins described to date. Identified proteins correspond to 138 different metabolic and disease pathways and provide a platform of mechanistically linked biomarker candidates for tracking disruptions in cellular processes. Moreover, among the identified proteins, 38 were found to be approved biomarkers for adult blood.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study advance current knowledge of the human cord blood serum proteome. They showcase the potential of UCB as a diagnostic medium for assessing infant health by detection and identification of candidate biomarkers for known disease pathways using a global, nontargeted approach. These biomarkers may inform about mechanisms of exposure-disease relationships. Furthermore, biomarkers approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for screening in adult blood were detected in UCB and represent high-priority targets for immediate validation.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicole Hansmeier"", ids = ""5508738""); list(name = ""Tzu-Chiao Chao"", ids = ""46589885""); list(name = ""Lynn R.

A cross-sectional study of healthy never-smoking women from rural Xuanwei and Fuyuan, China was conducted, which included 80 smoky coal and 14 anthracite (""smokeless"") coal users. Personal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was assessed using portable devices, while 67 circulating plasma immunologic/inflammatory markers were measured using multiplex bead-based assays. Multivariable linear regression models were employed to estimate associations between smoky coal versus smokeless coal use, indoor air pollutants, and immunologic/inflammatory markers. Six markers were altered among smoky coal users compared to smokeless coal, including significantly decreased interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (CXCL11/I-TAC), and increased serum amyloid P component (SAP). CXCL11/I-TAC was previously found to be reduced in workers exposed to high levels of diesel engine exhaust, which exhibits similar constituents as coal combustion emissions. Further, there was evidence that elevated PM2.5 and BaP exposure was associated with significantly diminished levels of the serum amyloid A (SAA); however, the false discovery rates (FDRs) were >0.2 after accounting for multiple comparisons. Inflammatory processes may thus mediate the carcinogenic effects attributed to smoky coal emissions.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jason Y Y Wong"", ids = ""145560789""); list(name = ""Bryan A Bassig"", ids = ""6660066""); list(name = ""Wei Hu"", ids = ""145066189""); list(name = ""Wei Jie Seow"", ids = ""3754595""); list(name = ""Meredith S Shiels"", ids = ""1868764""); list(name = ""B T Ji"", ids = ""1969313""); list(name = ""George S.

This study was designed to identify regulatory activity present in CSF, better elucidating environmental regulation of brain function. By using cannulation-based sequential CSF sampling coupled with mass spectrometry-based identification and quantification of proteins, we show that the naive mouse CSF harbors, among 22 other pathways, the innate immune system as a main pathway, which was downregulated and upregulated, respectively, by acute stressor (AS) and acute cocaine (AC) administrations.

04f1565642c1874c5b84579bf9b0308a6aaf3cd2,Inferring Functional Neural Connectivity with Deep Residual Convolutional Networks,"Measuring synaptic connectivity in large neuronal populations remains a major goal of modern neuroscience. While this connectivity is traditionally revealed by anatomical methods such as electron microscopy, an efficient alternative is to computationally infer functional connectivity from recordings of neural activity. However, these statistical techniques still require further refinement before they can be reliably applied to real data. Here, we report significant improvements to a deep learning method for functional connectomics, as assayed on synthetic ChaLearn Connectomics data. The method, which integrates recent advances in convolutional neural network architecture and model-free partial correlation coefficients, outperforms published methods on competition data and can achieve over 90% precision at 1% recall on validation datasets. This suggests that future application of the model to in vivo whole-brain imaging data in larval zebrafish could reliably recover on the order of 106 synaptic connections with a 10% false discovery rate. The model also generalizes to networks with different underlying connection probabilities and should scale well when parallelized across multiple GPUs. The method offers real potential as a statistical complement to existing experiments and circuit hypotheses in neuroscience.",2017,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Timothy W.

In youth with obesity, metabolomic data are sparse and associations with adiposity measures unknown.ObjectivesPrimary, to determine associations between adiposity measures and metabolomic profiles with increased cardiometabolic risks in youth with obesity. Secondary, to stratify associations by sex and puberty.MethodsParticipants were from COBRA (Childhood Overweight BioRepository of Australia; a paediatric cohort with obesity). Adiposity measures (BMI, BMI z-score, %truncal and %whole body fat, waist circumference and waist/height ratio), puberty staging and NMR metabolomic profiles from serum were assessed. Statistics included multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) and multiple linear regression models with false discovery rate adjustment.Results214 participants had metabolomic profiles analyzed, mean age 11.9Â years (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰3.1), mean BMI z-score 2.49 (SDâ€‰Â±â€‰0.24), 53% females. Unsupervised PCA identified no separable clusters of individuals. Positive associations included BMI z-score and phenylalanine, total body fat % and lipids in medium HDL, and waist circumference and tyrosine; negative associations included total body fat % and the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid/total fatty acids and histidine. Stratifying by sex and puberty, patterns of associations with BMI z-score in post-pubertal males included positive associations with lipid-, cholesterol- and triglyceride-content in VLDL lipoproteins; total fatty acids; total triglycerides; isoleucine, leucine and glycoprotein acetyls.ConclusionIn a paediatric cohort with obesity, increased adiposity measures, especially in post-pubertal males, were associated with distinct patterns in metabolomic profiles.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christoph Saner"", ids = ""143640789""); list(name = ""Brooke E Harcourt"", ids = ""5945344""); list(name = ""Ahwan Pandey"", ids = ""3731409""); list(name = ""Susan Ellul"", ids = ""67239886""); list(name = ""Zoe McCallum"", ids = ""5397098""); list(name = ""Kung-Ting Kao"", ids = ""14621901""); list(name = ""Celia Twindyakirana"", ids = ""81812759""); list(name = ""Anke Pons"", ids = ""31660196""); list(name = ""Erin J Alexander"", ids = ""46333671""); list(name = ""Richard Saffery"", ids = ""5778567""); list(name = ""David P Burgner"", ids = ""2116249""); list(name = ""Markus Juonala"", ids = ""4119674""); list(name = ""Matthew A Sabin"", ids = ""1685122"")",,e2c02689a26966e307ba6400aeb28cb1690f81e3; 3a14152f47cbfd38db21a3d7e6b1b8cf0a887358; 341c240712a98876ace110d3283e816bdaca2023; 9c1380d74b18e3a02c952e350cd69638ed71438f; 9bb77edcc1126a709d24e265c58c0cd55875511e; 78aff6dcff028978851c3eea6297cdc838b4aa88; bb28a9e7e71ad05929e7f1534909dc232fc1dbf5; 26f5a498b01688c1b3741614ccf51a92b80b297f; 7f5f46cb2d724deabc93c85dff34572df9744285; 5edaa46048641b51984fe4354e9f471870f21c81; 1dfbb0bd2e395a436c62a88a60121171ba482bc7; 510c7bad92e873967ba0a4abfebac2c50f41afe3; 253a0a7efdb7efe23b9a035189bd277d26e44e25; 2cf0402055829b46daeba5ccd3bb2e3982c719cd; 3fc57acb7711d1c02ff59ea2a8909bd934b3b108; 17a1154fdada0fc66e38c3571afaf3c87f937793; 892c3a128a8fe3ebc58044464132a51d44e6117d; d7e23fc594abe0e6d294e5857c0c66ec5a7c8bca; ee37bc9e175249ce4679d128f6164353419836ab; b57af2c677554013586462166e85c10d612e8f5f; 3840c855dcc5eb70936d2f26c4d0f1c2e4011677; 57b4ff9862f0636bfc98ad3b47cc2d80e4f9c7ca; a08425b9eb5241904ac17edc533989c98a07b966; 628517dad55c08d09fae9685d54cc3135c6d35c5; c9a2221f593f4cdc1ad922a85f89492bdcef3533; 99860eb2043b868c62daa80440f289e50844065d; a3060b97d12305795b6a5da2a34ecce27c770b33; 942a72042e7feddf16aac62fc95fa9b298726907; 2bed996bfd17e025204c35a2c04c0eb55f31c8e7; 2c23361c1e93cee320bf329d05bf056b3899d6f3; 91caaa00ab62211c0659654606e8ea19e5f7794f; a0e741a02af2dbdf5d6116a1a0a2ef9f243e5b28; 86280e6edd47042a7c433cc66b763c5378f6667e; 72c85c29eaaaf8b11f5fc3aa5a02e15cadcb1a15; 5a6073aafd74436b3fcffdf1e62bcb7b1636b859; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; cbe34983e90259bc589457d13575c541cf891803; 9481298df8f0a4d69e0c4ab8c808dd4162743939; 42be469178879ad3928baaddb1058974c1c15c4c; e18615f411b11e1872cd5db81af7b1efc784097d; e9b33f9c74ba289db02555ee47bbfe52698e2847; 71022474c1f8516be5e38c5c4089c4e4f2136a8b; 590db5b19f8a0a9993adf5d072907ba49063ea59; d49ca03e2cec15fc0dc84a504e4a2f5bb93f6b9b; 5e7eb3671fd37609300d75efd44fa19b6b64fce8; 26d464ce7c9087a52264e2d0db0ebcf4013cae40,Metabolomics,15,1-11
d0183bd780fd8bc14a3c519ffcbdfb24a04c7a7d,Identifying periodically expressed transcripts in microarray time series data,"MOTIVATION
Microarray experiments are now routinely used to collect large-scale time series data, for example to monitor gene expression during the cell cycle. Statistical analysis of this data poses many challenges, one being that it is hard to identify correctly the subset of genes with a clear periodic signature. This has lead to a controversial argument with regard to the suitability of both available methods and current microarray data.


METHODS
We introduce two simple but efficient statistical methods for signal detection and gene selection in gene expression time series data. First, we suggest the average periodogram as an exploratory device for graphical assessment of the presence of periodic transcripts in the data. Second, we describe an exact statistical test to identify periodically expressed genes that allows one to distinguish periodic from purely random processes. This identification method is based on the so-called g-statistic and uses the false discovery rate approach to multiple testing.


RESULTS
Using simulated data it is shown that the suggested method is capable of identifying cell-cycle-activated genes in a gene expression data set even if the number of the cyclic genes is very small and regardless the presence of a dominant non-periodic component in the data. Subsequently, we re-examine 12 large microarray time series data sets (in part controversially discussed) from yeast, human fibroblast, human HeLa and bacterial cells. Based on the statistical analysis it is found that a majority of these data sets contained little or no statistical significant evidence for genes with periodic variation linked to cell cycle regulation. On the other hand, for the remaining data the method extends the catalog of previously known cell-cycle-specific transcripts by identifying additional periodic genes not found by other methods. The problem of distinguishing periodicity due to generic cell cycle activity and to artifacts from synchronization is also discussed.

9290b0998c025f3cf1d9f36aea90a68c7c318d94,TF2Network: predicting transcription factor regulators and gene regulatory networks in Arabidopsis using publicly available binding site information,"A gene regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes. GRNs control different biological processes and have been instrumental to understand the organization and complexity of gene regulation. Although various experimental methods have been used to map GRNs in Arabidopsis thaliana, their limited throughput combined with the large number of TFs makes that for many genes our knowledge about regulating TFs is incomplete. We introduce TF2Network, a tool that exploits the vast amount of TF binding site information and enables the delineation of GRNs by detecting potential regulators for a set of co-expressed or functionally related genes. Validation using two experimental benchmarks reveals that TF2Network predicts the correct regulator in 75-92% of the test sets. Furthermore, our tool is robust to noise in the input gene sets, has a low false discovery rate, and shows a better performance to recover correct regulators compared to other plant tools.

8685054ddd72ce03f511546df006ef1b67e382a9,Effects of aflatoxin on hepatic gene expression in a poultry model,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary aflatoxin (AF) on hepatic gene expression in male broiler chicks. Seventy five day-old male broiler chicks were assigned to three dietary treatments (five replicates of five chicks each) from hatch to day 21. The diets contained 0, 1 and 2 mg AF/kg of feed. Aflatoxin reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG), serum total proteins, serum Ca and P, but increased (P < 0.01) liver weights in a dose dependent manner. Microarray analysis was used to identify shifts in genetic expression associated with the affected physiological processes in chicks fed 0 and 2 mg AF/kg of feed to identify potential targets for pharmacological/toxicological intervention. A loop design was used for microarray experiments with three technical and four biological replicates per treatment group. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from liver tissue and its quality was determined using gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. High quality RNA was purified from DNA contamination, reverse transcribed, and hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray chip. Microarray data were analyzed using a 2-step ANOVA model and validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Genes with false discovery rates less than 13% and fold change greater than 1.4% were considered as differentially expressed.

We applied mRNA spike-in approaches to develop a comprehensive set of experimental benchmark data and used it to evaluate various methods for identification of differential expression. Our results show that using the median log ratio to identify differential expression is superior to more complex and popular methods such as modified t-statistics. The median log ratio method is robust that a reasonably high accuracy of identification of differentially expressed genes can be achieved even for data with a small number of replicates and strong experimental variation between replicates. Machine learning for classification of differential expression based on the benchmark dataset indicates the existence of even more accurate methods for identification of differential expression. With this dataset, it can be also demonstrated that the methods prediction of false discovery rate based on a small number of replicates could be very inaccurate.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Henry Yang"", ids = ""49424179"")",,b5860253e015c27e8b125cf9b7ba2cb543dc36ed; e520cc396db99a52c1f0a67c0539b68f268f7669; 8642d0b648a6d7c4ec61750699dc391d9099ee37; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 7717532514eb9640981668dd542db4071b89ffc7; 395162f286bb357cffef665106c8788c090f06f7; 25ad536ab1ee2a48024f06c63fcfe29f4cb6c1c7; cc67ff7c8af84b2f518aedea4065de0bbc0b8671; 00db22468a38133aadcccd4fa7de084dccea3e34,,,91-98
a7fbc8d671b1377f68023228a7c720d6253327fc,Abstract 1121: LKB1 mutation correlates with a unique gene expression profile in NSCLC,"Background: Germline mutations in LKB1 gene cause the Peutz-Jegher syndrome, an elevated cancer risk condition. LKB1 somatic mutations are present in âˆ¼30% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). LKB1 encodes a serine-threonine kinase involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism and epithelial cell polarity. Importantly, downstream proteins and events in LKB1 pathway remain to be determined in NSCLC. Aims: 1) Characterize the mutational status of LKB1 in a panel of NSCLC cell lines; 2) Correlate mutations of LKB1, EGFR and KRAS, and 3) Identify differentially expressed genes in NSCLC cell lines harboring LKB1 inactivating mutations. Methods: 42 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from never or light smokers with or without EGFR mutations (n=20) and from smokers with or without KRAS mutations (n=22), were screened for LKB1: 1) gene mutations (by exon sequencing); 2) gene copy number variations (by qPCR) and 3) promoter hypermethylation (by methylation-specific PCR). Gene expression profiling (Illumina microarray) was performed in LKB1 mutant cell lines. NSCLC cell lines wild-types for LKB1 gene were selected for comparison. Candidate gene expression levels were verified by qRT-PCR. Protein levels were determined by immunobloting. Results: LKB1 gene mutations were present in 33% of the cell lines. Specifically, frameshift (7/14), nonsense (4/14), and missense (2/14) mutations were detected. Homozygous deletion was found in only one cell line. EGFR activating mutation and LKB1 inactivating mutations were mutually exclusive, whereas LKB1 mutational status was not associated with KRAS mutations nor smoker status. LKB1 protein was undetectable in all the cell lines with LKB1 gene inactivating mutations (12/14). No gain in LKB1 gene copy number was found and gene promoter hypermethylation was detected in only five cell lines. Importantly, no correlations between LKB1 promoter hypermethylation and LKB1 mRNA and protein levels were found. Significance Analysis of Microarrays and False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis identified differentially expressed genes in the LKB1 mutant versus LKB1 wild type NSCLC cell lines. With a FDR tolerance of Conclusion: 1) LKB1 mutations are a frequent finding in NSCLC cell lines and they are mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations; 2) there is a good concordance between LKB1 inactivating mutations and absence of LKB1 protein expression, suggesting that LKB1 protein expression is a good proxy for LKB1 mutational status in NSCLC and 3) LKB1 mutations correlates with a unique gene expression profile in NSCLC.

230fc0ba12780578b536ed8c3b448c5be770435b,Bovine hepatic differential gene expression in response to perennial ryegrass staggers,">â€˜Perennial ryegrass staggersâ€™ is a neurological condition characterised by muscular tremors and ataxia in livestock that ingest the indole diterpene lolitrem B from endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass. While the neurotoxic mechanism of action of ryegrass staggers has been defined, little is known about metabolic and other molecular processes that lolitrem B may affect in livestock. The objective of this study was to characterise differential gene expression in the liver of animals fed lolitrem B-containing feed over an extended period of time. Eighteen steers were fed one of three rations (n=6/group) containing lolitrem B (247, 1,554 or 2,256 Î¼g/kg (dry matter basis)) over 64 days in a double-blind study. Microarray and confirmatory qPCR were performed to evaluate the hepatic gene expression profile from biopsies taken on days 0 and 64. Widespread perturbation of gene expression was observed in all groups receiving lolitrem B, with a total of 152 differential genes identified (false discovery rate â‰¤0.0...",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Lewyn Li"", ids = ""50703897""); list(name = ""D.

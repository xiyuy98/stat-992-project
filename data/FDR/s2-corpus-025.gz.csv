1a39311f9fff06ab3fc5f2efc2f4ff86f1db17f6,Widespread purifying selection on RNA structure in mammals,"Evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structures are a robust indicator of purifying selection and, consequently, molecular function. Evaluating their genome-wide occurrence through comparative genomics has consistently been plagued by high false-positive rates and divergent predictions. We present a novel benchmarking pipeline aimed at calibrating the precision of genome-wide scans for consensus RNA structure prediction. The benchmarking data obtained from two refined structure prediction algorithms, RNAz and SISSIz, were then analyzed to fine-tune the parameters of an optimized workflow for genomic sliding window screens. When applied to consistency-based multiple genome alignments of 35 mammals, our approach confidently identifies >4 million evolutionarily constrained RNA structures using a conservative sensitivity threshold that entails historically low false discovery rates for such analyses (5-22%). These predictions comprise 13.6% of the human genome, 88% of which fall outside any known sequence-constrained element, suggesting that a large proportion of the mammalian genome is functional. As an example, our findings identify both known and novel conserved RNA structure motifs in the long noncoding RNA MALAT1. This study provides an extensive set of functional transcriptomic annotations that will assist researchers in uncovering the precise mechanisms underlying the developmental ontologies of higher eukaryotes.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin A.

7e4c01b662f9ff59ba09be95a03437564e31ab29,Aging Shapes the Population-Mean and -Dispersion of Gene Expression in Human Brains,"Human aging is associated with cognitive decline and an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. Our objective for this study was to evaluate potential relationships between age and variation in gene expression across different regions of the brain. We analyzed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data from 54 to 101 tissue samples across 13 brain regions in post-mortem donors of European descent aged between 20 and 70 years at death. After accounting for the effects of covariates and hidden confounding factors, we identified 1446 protein-coding genes whose expression in one or more brain regions is correlated with chronological age at a false discovery rate of 5%. These genes are involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, mRNA splicing, amino acid biosynthesis, and neurotransmitter transport. The distribution of these genes among brain regions is uneven, suggesting variable regional responses to aging. We also found that the aging response of many genes, e.g., TP37 and C1QA, depends on individuals' genotypic backgrounds. Finally, using dispersion-specific analysis, we identified genes such as IL7R, MS4A4E, and TERF1/TERF2 whose expressions are differentially dispersed by aging, i.e., variances differ between age groups.

ce528e7080e989f8c9f0ecd3764486d015d46a94,Gene expression and pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer,"Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant systemic treatment appears to be a valid surrogate for better overall survival in breast cancer patients. Currently, together with standard clinicopathologic assessment, novel molecular biomarkers are being exhaustively tested in order to look into the heterogeneity of breast cancer. The aim of our study was to examine an association between 23-gene real-time-PCR expression assay including ABCB1, ABCC1, BAX, BBC3, BCL2, CASP3, CYP2D6, ERCC1, FOXC1, GAPDH, IGF1R, IRF1, MAP2, MAPK 8, MAPK9, MKI67, MMP9, NCOA3, PARP1, PIK3CA, TGFB3, TOP2A, and YWHAZ receptor status of breast cancer core biopsies sampled before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (anthracycline and taxanes) and pathologic response. Core-needle biopsies were collected from 42 female patients with inoperable locally advanced breast cancer or resectable tumors suitable for downstaging, before any treatment. Expressions of 23 genes were determined by means of TagMan low density arrays. Analysis of variance was used to select genes with discriminatory potential between receptor subtypes. We introduced a correction for false discovery rates (presented as q values) due to multiple hypothesis testing. Statistical analysis showed that seven genes out of a 23-gene real-time-PCR expression assay differed significantly in relation to pathologic response regardless of breast cancer subtypes. Among these genes, we identified: BAX (pÂ =Â 0.0146), CYP2D6 (pÂ =Â 0.0063), ERCC1 (pÂ =Â 0.0231), FOXC1 (pÂ =Â 0.0048), IRF1 (pÂ =Â 0.0022), MAP2 (pÂ =Â 0.0011), and MKI67 (pÂ =Â 0.0332). The assessment of core biopsy gene profiles and receptor-based subtypes, before neoadjuvant therapy seems to predict response or resistance and to define new signaling pathways to provide more powerful classifiers in breast cancer, hence the need for further research.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Agnieszka KoÅ‚aciÅ„ska"", ids = ""152381267""); list(name = ""Wojciech Fendler"", ids = ""3030426""); list(name = ""Janusz Szemraj"", ids = ""5666387""); list(name = ""BoÅ¼ena SzymaÅ„ska"", ids = ""40382326""); list(name = ""Ewa Borowska-Garganisz"", ids = ""1412128611""); list(name = ""Magdalena Nowik"", ids = ""31832144""); list(name = ""Justyna ChaÅ‚ubiÅ„ska"", ids = ""152505233""); list(name = ""Robert Kubiak"", ids = ""144329563""); list(name = ""Zofia PawÅ‚owska"", ids = ""4935143""); list(name = ""Maria BÅ‚asiÅ„ska-Morawiec"", ids = ""1399106869""); list(name = ""Piotr Potemski"", ids = ""50029656""); list(name = ""Arkadiusz Jeziorski"", ids = ""49689390""); list(name = ""Zbigniew Morawiec"", ids = ""6384588"")",75669f21c88472b3f02409a788f5f2b74f4676bf; af555241bb37b44b53a2fa808255348e58b369a4; 9278d0aafe593a264f1ad9e0ac9a36e5eb5cd8f4; 9da8d21c82ecb293fda66b68ae11dee79b1f2ca0; 9d69e20b73ff0b100d12b144e83a86faedde0a82; 89865d59405032112d36064ca7093749215cd09d; 630e68a95cd875ca7bac44659537a45082da6eb7; a5e7609c26f2b9514c3e1c86733e16e605296621,0c0d64833c55213b45b927484f15c5ec1c1499de; d03e8774e422a43ad5721db18ac199402f7acc40; 66a3388a1d988e7595448e0f0641f6cb568b6d6f; 87d1a27a8bffd278f56644d11ff643b85d41fa4f; 442bb3bf27b11a2bf5fcac533cc6ff139796c1e2; 8e80fdd73ef7dc740b9857c1893514400bca7aad; 5fa0c593b940ef1e7d1f7596a816677735edef4c; 1d26bd49a2ffc7f5466192801168549571a86b7f; 86668e2a05a0cd4d61fc6a0c7d60a6efa2ef07af; 3329b64342bf8dd2442aec0ce7b806d955fe6421; d2fb39f96d711505b98eae737e4ffd2c7a0f94f6; 594aa1d8ffd636c188853315eba01559efd2a09d; 844ff6c9b26a1f2c7e78f6aa824efa2e893511bc; 1d99c86bb948c23eeb2d639a010fc77f4d7f0493; eeec18953cbacb2e30fc5765bedadbc348976ff7; 5477db6b7299cda20a4a0182c15302caa6d2fc29; 3b87fdc0b99c34a67bc36508cf46b81b8b79acb7; 6b43c3fda2f5e94b2ebc7a156ea1a9182414af6d; d76f3f5adf82d9c688993726e0c0bde17145195a; 9f0cd4b07e4577232b5884ce23e572436ffad41a; 4fd1ea66b605380a4933c54d2ca01411acffa288; 7fa675b55058a23b5f30f730f37a6d9cd3a26df9; e68246e952608d9332c58f6be0af63657fb2ecd4,Molecular Biology Reports,39,7435-7441

This is due to dramatic progress not only in chromatin immunoprecipitation combined by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) but also in advanced statistical analyses. A fundamental issue, however, is the alarming number of false positive predictions. This problem can be remedied by improved peak calling methods of twin peaks, one at each strand of the DNA, kernel density estimators, and false discovery rate estimations based on control libraries. Predictions are filtered by de novo motif discovery in the peak environments. These methods have been implemented in, among others, Valouev et al.'s Quantitative Enrichment of Sequence Tags (QuEST) software tool. We demonstrate the prediction of the human growth-associated binding protein (GABPalpha) based on ChIP-seq observations.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shuo Jiao"", ids = ""2984344""); list(name = ""Cheryl P.

00dd3fdc15d2f7327681b238fb630d4ca134cd2f,Screening of human chromosome 21 genes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with Down syndrome.,"The aim of the current study was to identify the genes on human chromosome 21 (HC21) that may serve important functions in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome (DS). The microarray data GSE5390 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which contained 7 DS and 8 healthy normal samples. The data were then normalized and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the LIMMA package and Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, the DEGs underwent clustering and gene ontology analysis. Additionally, the locations of the DEGs on HC21 were confirmed using human genome 19 in the University of California, Santa Cruz Interaction Browser. A total of 25 upregulated and 275 downregulated genes were screened between DS and healthy samples with a false discovery rate of <0.05 and |logFC|>1. The expression levels of these genes in the two samples were different. In addition, the upâ€‘ and downregulated genes were markedly enriched in organic substance biological processes (P=4.48x10â€‘10) and cellâ€‘cell signaling (P=0.000227). Furthermore, 17 overexpressed genes were identified on the 21q21â€‘22 area, including COL6A2, TTC3 and ABCG1. Together, these observations suggest that 17 upregulated genes on HC21 may be involved in the development of DS and provide the basis for understanding this disability.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiangdong Kong"", ids = ""120519578""); list(name = ""Ning Liu"", ids = ""145915299""); list(name = ""Xue-ju Xu"", ids = ""13910870""); list(name = ""Zhen-hua Zhao"", ids = ""145616007""); list(name = ""Miao Jiang"", ids = ""144162232"")",d3f67bb31cea5d3f45970d05da59069dcacca8f2; 312c1d851d4e5dd25711e46c0c31cb7019742dd6; 11599cafb9f4b68df62edfff524a2287c17be94f,f51a91f31e8f67edbdf4e33b8661c7b1bffffc7e; eb130a21cd8b494ff6c98cc6ae8c6488fe8ea747; a23fb716bdbea2b7c372a11862353d9357338f9f; 84114eaaa07e1068c3294231c62bcd09d0daecf6; 90f3b13b7ec845051934c545701c52129561a8a6; da72112e421ddf72a2966d7987bef02f1fbe73e9; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 7b535b8254adf552483b86e90aa3d7af8422b241; 2b80b478037e904dd44bbb256f5f0e4bed00f5c9; a175453ceff401c67ce503750418e66936331b06; dccf69c37151d6f85f988ba46035b96f4f05fd61; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5c0394a8130f4d686b4a578e5fcd895fabde498a; f68dfa2a0d521ecda223dc61df8a5ac177f023ae; c26c0344dfdb521a7403e0100370964a20a4c2e1; 43e45ae358e568ae6dd957b2ff3428a9c169dce0; 490b4258ee75162dfe5b7eb5d1bc40d24a62b960; cb19024f90d759cad27ca1301311d3c250c62a49; 8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 65d4950da3879a0510ad4cf650d43308658b2592; 5c8fe9a0412a078e30eb7e5eeb0068655b673e86; c36a892ba04bb755970101c206203bcf920dae2c; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; eaf023317b33c7ac81488db343d204267e0ea830; 287cd7e53643b714ab1d451bec2e42e72b42a316,Molecular medicine reports,11 2,"

Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious complication of pregnancy. It is considered a complex condition influenced by maternal genes, environmental factors and a deregulated immune response of the mother, but the etiology is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PE, to help elucidate the identification of the disease etiological mechanisms.


STUDY DESIGN
The databases Pubmed and GEO were searched according to PRISMA guidelines for the existence of gene expression data on placental samples from case-control studies. After meta-analysis the identified DEGs were further analyzed with STRING and PANTHER to retrieve interaction networks and overrepresented biochemical pathways.


RESULTS
Only 10 gene expression datasets and articles fulfilled inclusion criteria, containing data on 195 patients and 231 controls, and were analyzed. Meta-analysis identified 629 DEGs to be associated with PE at a False Discovery Rate p-value of 0.01. Network analysis showed few highly interconnected genes involved in innate immunity and signal transduction pathways indicative of a multifaceted disease with etiological heterogeneity. over representation analysis revealed that these genes participate mainly in carbohydrates, amino acids and pyrimidine metabolism, circadian clock system and signal transduction pathways.


CONCLUSIONS
This work, combining rigorous methods of meta-analysis and the use of modern bioinformatics tools, proposes the existence of novel, overlooked so far, biochemical pathways and mechanisms to contribute to PE development such as carbohydrate, aminoacids and pyrimidine metabolism. Our findings pave the way for further investigation of the above pathways in experimental efforts to decipher the orchestrating mechanisms for PE development.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Konstantina E Vennou"", ids = ""1380149587""); list(name = ""Panagiota I.

c6387b2679fc3b793ee8b3d9d2e96035dfbc5609,A statistical method for the detection of variants from next-generation resequencing of DNA pools,"Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the sequencing of several human genomes in their entirety. However, the routine resequencing of complete genomes remains infeasible. The massive capacity of next-generation sequencers can be harnessed for sequencing specific genomic regions in hundreds to thousands of individuals. Sequencing-based association studies are currently limited by the low level of multiplexing offered by sequencing platforms. Pooled sequencing represents a cost-effective approach for studying rare variants in large populations. To utilize the power of DNA pooling, it is important to accurately identify sequence variants from pooled sequencing data. Detection of rare variants from pooled sequencing represents a different challenge than detection of variants from individual sequencing. 
 
Results: We describe a novel statistical approach, CRISP [Comprehensive Read analysis for Identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Pooled sequencing] that is able to identify both rare and common variants by using two approaches: (i) comparing the distribution of allele counts across multiple pools using contingency tables and (ii) evaluating the probability of observing multiple non-reference base calls due to sequencing errors alone. Information about the distribution of reads between the forward and reverse strands and the size of the pools is also incorporated within this framework to filter out false variants. Validation of CRISP on two separate pooled sequencing datasets generated using the Illumina Genome Analyzer demonstrates that it can detect 80â€“85% of SNPs identified using individual sequencing while achieving a low false discovery rate (3â€“5%). Comparison with previous methods for pooled SNP detection demonstrates the significantly lower false positive and false negative rates for CRISP.

56d455aaeb6c1a24177b6729f7dbc977026c0231,Variation at 2q35 (PNKD and TMBIM1) influences colorectal cancer risk and identifies a pleiotropic effect with inflammatory bowel disease,"To identify new risk loci for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a meta-analysis of seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with independent replication, totalling 13 656 CRC cases and 21 667 controls of European ancestry. The combined analysis identified a new risk association for CRC at 2q35 marked by rs992157 (P = 3.15 Ã— 10-8, odds ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.13), which is intronic to PNKD (paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia) and TMBIM1 (transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1). Intriguingly this susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.90, D' = 0.96) with the previously discovered GWAS SNP rs2382817 for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following on from this observation we examined for pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, between CRC and the 200 established IBD risk loci, identifying an additional 11 significant associations (false discovery rate [FDR]) < 0.05). Our findings provide further insight into the biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC, and identify risk factors that may influence the development of both CRC and IBD.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Giulia Orlando"", ids = ""3661056""); list(name = ""Philip J.

3757808a0eca4ce1ea265263a1453dc2fedd6a94,Gene Expression Changes in Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial (hRPE) Cells Following Infection with Toxoplasma gondii,"Purpose : Ocular toxoplasmosis â€“ caused by retinal infection with T. gondii â€“ is a major cause of vision impairment worldwide in both immuno- compromised and competent individuals. Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in the human are poorly understood, and available drug treatments do not prevent recurrent attacks of retinal inflammation. We investigated differential gene expression by hRPE cells infected with T. gondii to elucidate parasite-host cell interactions in the immune privileged retina. 
 
Methods : One group of hRPE cells, harvested from 3 cadaveric donor eye-pairs, was infected with T. gondii natural virulent strain GT-1 (MOI = 5:1, parasite viability > 20%) or mock-infected (singlet samples). Total RNA was isolated 24 hours post-infection. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on the Illumina NextSeq platform: samples were aligned to human hg19 and mirbase, and T. gondii reference sequences, and data were normalized in EdgeR. False Discovery Rate (FDR) 2 or < (-2) fold-change (FC). 
 
Results : A total of 7234 genes were significantly differentially expressed between T. gondii- and mock- infected hRPE cells: 1968 had FC > 2 and 1739 had FC 2 and 4 had FC < (-2). Fold-changes of 15 protein-coding RNA (TGFb2, TSP1, IL6, ANGTPL7, IL1RN, PTGS2, ICAM1, CXCL3, CCL2, NFKB1, BIRC3, TSLP, IL17RB, LRP8 and IL11) and 4 long non-coding RNA (MIR155HG, LINC01105, LINC00968 and MALAT1) involved in the immune response were confirmed by RT-qPCR. 
 
Conclusions : Our findings highlight the large number of genes that are modulated during T. gondii infection of human retinal pigment epithelium. Future studies will focus on gene ontology, pathway and network analyses to decipher inflammatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ocular toxoplasmosis. These results could provide clues to more effective treatments for infection with T. gondii.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Audra M. A.

480c5f32630c79963618a5d4cb173e4cf20a2e39,A new multivariate EWMA control chart via multiple testing,"Abstract This paper proposes a new type of multivariate EWMA control chart for detecting the process mean shift on the basis of a series of most recent T-squared statistics. We established a multiple hypothesis testing which uses the false discovery rate as the error to be controlled. Particularly, Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure is applied to develop a new control scheme. A nonparametric density estimation based on the Parzen windows is adopted to approximate the distribution of the T-square statistics, from which the p-values are calculated. The performance of the proposed control charts is evaluated in terms of the out-of-control average run length and the in-control average run length according to various non-centrality parameters associated with the mean shifts. The result shows that the proposed control chart performs better than the existing multivariate EWMA chart for all mean shifts. The proposed method seems to be rigorous in the sense that error rates for the multiple hypotheses are considered in an integrated way via FDR rather than considering type I and II errors separately.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jang-Ho Park"", ids = ""48491094""); list(name = ""Chi-Hyuck Jun"", ids = ""1823126"")",dbad4dc8ff9c9b53a66cb1a3fcaba6bdb460792f; 6d84eca2661f732a32ad9f53b4fdee83fb3338ab; 591978cc66a373938ebf1c005df984ebdfb9a2b7; b1b9375b0bbd7026bb91e27cf38c8d9b253357bf; 44edf85cf4413a098783118c97fd746f1484cd95; 14aa6789eef2a5124c7abd8c07cb89eb9b917f3f,,Journal of Process Control,26,51-55
5a6cb3e3e988c2705bab55d4dd04b2c3f3b708bf,dsPIG: a tool to predict imprinted genes from the deep sequencing of whole transcriptomes,"BackgroundDysregulation of imprinted genes, which are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, plays an important role in various human diseases, such as cancer and behavioral disorder. To date, however, fewer than 100 imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. The recent availability of high-throughput technology makes it possible to have large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. Here we propose a Bayesian model (dsPIG) to predict imprinted genes on the basis of allelic expression observed in mRNA-Seq data of independent human tissues.ResultsOur model (dsPIG) was capable of identifying imprinted genes with high sensitivity and specificity and a low false discovery rate when the number of sequenced tissue samples was fairly large, according to simulations. By applying dsPIG to the mRNA-Seq data, we predicted 94 imprinted genes in 20 cerebellum samples and 57 imprinted genes in 9 diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates. We also assessed dsPIG using previously validated imprinted and non-imprinted genes. With simulations, we further analyzed how imbalanced allelic expression of non-imprinted genes or different minor allele frequencies affected the predictions of dsPIG. Interestingly, we found that, among biallelically expressed genes, at least 18 genes expressed significantly more transcripts from one allele than the other among different individuals and tissues.ConclusionWith the prevalence of the mRNA-Seq technology, dsPIG has become a useful tool for analysis of allelic expression and large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. For ease of use, we have set up a web service and also provided an R package for dsPIG at http://www.shoudanliang.com/dsPIG/.",2012,Medicine; Computer Science; Biology,"list(name = ""Hui Li"", ids = ""47893211""); list(name = ""Xiao Su"", ids = ""143715226""); list(name = ""Juan Gallegos"", ids = ""144026170""); list(name = ""Yue Lu"", ids = ""33558846""); list(name = ""Yuan Ji"", ids = ""46984249""); list(name = ""Jeffrey J.

ed2096b1858680e33da4b8796ea905176e9260d5,A New Test Statistic Based on Shrunken Sample Variance for Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes in Small Microarray Experiments,"Choosing an appropriate statistic and precisely evaluating the false discovery rate (FDR) are both essential for devising an effective method for identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray data. The t-type score proposed by Pan et al. (2003) succeeded in suppressing false positives by controlling the underestimation of variance but left the overestimation uncontrolled. For controlling the overestimation, we devised a new test statistic (variance stabilized t-type score) by placing shrunken sample variances of the James-Stein type in the denominator of the t-type score. Since the relative superiority of the mean and median FDRs was unclear in the widely adopted Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), we conducted simulation studies to examine the performance of the variance stabilized t-type score and the characteristics of the two FDRs. The variance stabilized t-type score was generally better than or at least as good as the t-type score, irrespective of the sample size and proportion of differentially expressed genes. In terms of accuracy, the median FDR was superior to the mean FDR when the proportion of differentially expressed genes was large.

412f12190929c03a24bc47d6a537afe200048b7c,A genome-wide methylation study of severe vitamin D deficiency in African American adolescents.,"OBJECTIVES
To test the hypothesis that changes in DNA methylation are involved in vitamin D deficiency-related immune cell regulation using an unbiased genome-wide approach combined with a genomic and epigenomic integrative approach.


STUDY DESIGN
We performed a genome-wide methylation scan using the Illumina HumanMethylation 27 BeadChip on leukocyte DNA of 11 cases of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] â‰¤ 25 nmol/L) and 11 age-matched controls ([25(OH)D] > 75 nmol/L); the subjects were African American normal-weight (body mass index <85th percentile) males aged 14-19 years. The Limma package was used to analyze each CpG site for differential methylation between cases and controls. To correct for multiple testing, the set of raw P values were converted to false discovery rates (FDRs). We also compared our findings with the recent data from Genome-Wide Association Studies of circulating 25(OH)D levels and then performed a permutation test to examine whether the ""double hit"" genes were randomly enriched.


RESULTS
A total of 79 CpG sites achieved raw P < .001. Of the 79 CpG sites, 2 CpG sites survived multiple testing: cg16317961 (raw P = 3.5 Ã— 10(-6), FDR = 0.078, in MAPRE2) and cg04623955 (raw P = 5.9 Ã— 10(-6), FDR = 0.078, in DIO3). Furthermore, 3 out of the 4 genes previously identified in the 2 Genome-Wide Association Studies were also significant at the methylation level (DHCR7: cg07487535, P = .015 and cg10763288, P = .017; CYP2R1: cg25454890, P = .040; CYP24A1: cg18956481, P = .022), reflecting significant enrichment (P = .0098).


CONCLUSION
Severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with methylation changes in leukocyte DNA. The genomic and epigenomic approach reinforce the crucial roles played by the DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1 genes in vitamin D metabolism.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Haidong Zhu"", ids = ""38448191""); list(name = ""Xiao-ling Wang"", ids = ""50141206""); list(name = ""Huidong Shi"", ids = ""48626872""); list(name = ""Shao-yong Su"", ids = ""6310036""); list(name = ""Gregory A.

072d38ef777c2a03012021981261bb9fd2d10d7c,SLC17A7 gene may be the indicator of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment response in the Chinese Han population.,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used drugs for major depressive disorder (MDD), although the treatment outcomes vary in different people. The vesicular glutamate transporter 1 coded by SLC17A7 gene has been reported associated with MDD. According to its role in glutamate transmission, it is reasonable to consider it as a potential pharmacogenetic candidate in SSRI treatment. A total of 290 MDD patients who had been taking SSRIs for 6 weeks were recruited. Their genotypes were assessed for the presence of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were selected from either the HapMap Chinese ethnic group or the literature report. Treatment effects were evaluated by the change rate of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. After the adjustment for the false discovery rate, 1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs74174284, false discovery rate; P = 0.032) demonstrated significant association with SSRI treatment response at week 6. Our results suggest that genetic variants in the SLC17A7 gene may be indicators of treatment response in MDD patients treated by SSRIs.",2014,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Xin Li"", ids = ""144844153""); list(name = ""T Yu"", ids = ""143815592""); list(name = ""Xiaoye Huang"", ids = ""4685138""); list(name = ""Yanfei Cao"", ids = ""7185858""); list(name = ""Xingwang Li"", ids = ""48568662""); list(name = ""Bao-cheng Liu"", ids = ""6200945""); list(name = ""Fengping Yang"", ids = ""7468234""); list(name = ""Weidong Li"", ids = ""40290511""); list(name = ""Xinzhi Zhao"", ids = ""144398730""); list(name = ""Guoyin Feng"", ids = ""3688802""); list(name = ""Xu Zhang"", ids = ""47957523""); list(name = ""Zaiquan Dong"", ids = ""8348813""); list(name = ""Yi Lin"", ids = ""47904387""); list(name = ""Xirong Li"", ids = ""48568991""); list(name = ""Lin He"", ids = ""143859631""); list(name = ""Xueli Sun"", ids = ""8283268""); list(name = ""Guang He"", ids = ""4664525"")",2edc8a9b51c33b23e64567aaf08a5b3cdeef4ebf; 8fecf9aaf4fe53973706c8aa7f4a648aaf0f10ea; c648252a8a915db4db9e5d9147fa8abc1f20965e; 2aaf0c1e80272171765486185f365a7903a84516,ec3debcf7b53c5e1df2cc05fb78f618e6e3cf306; e1febcde2d2c1a89cc585fb49509d2310963f061; 7e10eebe3690273c85f8b8d1caaf9e0e2577802d; 925e43609f6af6218557ef1ab396ceb2c0dd76aa; 805af2978f4821d3469d88cfe5ad12cfa9a03a49; b3a14e799a53e7af6ad22ec0a2c3ea9e0c23092a; 8765189c5dc5c3ce0686f36fa03df22eef078a16; 6c9089588bb926f2aebc4e4c6d4f8cbbfb0a2994; f3b2939337dd9ce643f0e5798c31b42c8f4c197a; 96793c7afed9f384c14363cea03b7d9d9e4c1bf4; 79a46bba8384134450679b86715d7cc968b273a3; a20690bb9bb8b9d5856f8431d3a75fbf3db21fbc; 222f3645689ee35596770afb32c6f1ca57c36414; b0a5124e88cb28ad515b26448ba0fdf6f00b9771; 3e83c317059846d97106b64a4befc4c24b87e3d1; 178a89c5ba4da7b0826f5533070afc8ac02eb22d; 01bbd16647da3afa305903826b5af7dedd073040; 988144c11f6af30514070471ff226514fae7e401; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; d0564b52a6828c125ee3a590a5c19d847e08b586; a2b2a25c60aa8ff984debc2403c4e093dfe7824f; a3f9f727495375b0754b57dba3bdaf788e8771bd; 755471d5bde7ab320fc3c8ba4929bd58f1d07245; f80b0a175273b78e85004192c6186e55cfa15702; 0fabc0cc99623e847e062a78e9d237ce619fe2c9; 50c440513c8ef524f5d71457485248ea1b2bb007; 6c2df543e119d29200cdb7df18966cda0d86014e; 59de054456db80467dc7bb7be1824837b2c2364d; 2dbc088fd5d51e4004404f99f262356c3d8d2c0a; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 384aa3c085c1e9fa600c5f2a508d3a6b815f03cc; 084a633704fe06466a77199ea17748156f29af79; 3eb21ed15b8b94ea2e88046bed724a668151228f; bdf0c320892b2863f8bd6dbcff5c569e556dd906; 085fcc39f1bfdf1eb2d5ec908b7ccaadf43da9f3,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,34 3,"

In this article, a regression spline version of SiZer is proposed in a nonparametric regression setting by the fiducial method. The number of knots for spline interpolation is used as the scale parameter of the new SiZer, which controls the smoothness of estimate. In the construction of the new SiZer, multiple testing adjustment is made to control the row-wise false discovery rate (FDR) of SiZer. This adjustment is appealing for exploratory data analysis and has potential to increase the power. A special map is also produced on a continuous scale using p-values to assess the significance of features. Simulations and a real data application are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed SiZer, in which several comparisons with other existing SiZers are presented.

581fdb071b127ff832d2e77460f489c988466328,Transcriptomics analysis of lungs and peripheral blood of crystalline silica-exposed rats.,"Minimally invasive approaches to detect/predict target organ toxicity have significant practical applications in occupational toxicology. The potential application of peripheral blood transcriptomics as a practical approach to study the mechanisms of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity was investigated. Rats were exposed by inhalation to crystalline silica (15 mg/m(3), 6 h/day, 5 days) and pulmonary toxicity and global gene expression profiles of lungs and peripheral blood were determined at 32 weeks following termination of exposure. A significant elevation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase activity and moderate histological changes in the lungs, including type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and fibrosis, indicated pulmonary toxicity in the rats. Similarly, significant infiltration of neutrophils and elevated monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels in the lungs showed pulmonary inflammation in the rats. Microarray analysis of global gene expression profiles identified significant differential expression [>1.5-fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) p < 0.01] of 520 and 537 genes, respectively, in the lungs and blood of the exposed rats. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes demonstrated significant similarity in the biological processes, molecular networks, and canonical pathways enriched by silica exposure in the lungs and blood of the rats. Several genes involved in functions relevant to silica-induced pulmonary toxicity such as inflammation, respiratory diseases, cancer, cellular movement, fibrosis, etc, were found significantly differentially expressed in the lungs and blood of the silica-exposed rats. The results of this study suggested the potential application of peripheral blood gene expression profiling as a toxicologically relevant and minimally invasive surrogate approach to study the mechanisms underlying silica-induced pulmonary toxicity.",2012,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Rajendran Sellamuthu"", ids = ""4283950""); list(name = ""Christina Umbright"", ids = ""10091313""); list(name = ""Jenny R.

c6d52d3815d0a3b6a94455aa86ceeb84ee7ff0ee,Functional and gene network analyses of transcriptional signatures characterizing pre-weaned bovine mammary parenchyma or fat pad uncovered novel inter-tissue signaling networks during development,"BackgroundThe neonatal bovine mammary fat pad (MFP) surrounding the mammary parenchyma (PAR) is thought to exert proliferative effects on the PAR through secretion of local modulators of growth induced by systemic hormones. We used bioinformatics to characterize transcriptomics differences between PAR and MFP from ~65 d old Holstein heifers. Data were mined to uncover potential crosstalk through the analyses of signaling molecules preferentially expressed in one tissue relative to the other.ResultsOver 9,000 differentially expressed genes (DEG; False discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05) were found of which 1,478 had a â‰¥1.5-fold difference between PAR and MFP. Within the DEG highly-expressed in PAR vs. MFP (n = 736) we noted significant enrichment of functions related to cell cycle, structural organization, signaling, and DNA/RNA metabolism. Only actin cytoskeletal signaling was significant among canonical pathways. DEG more highly-expressed in MFP vs. PAR (n = 742) belong to lipid metabolism, signaling, cell movement, and immune-related functions. Canonical pathways associated with metabolism and signaling, particularly immune- and metabolism-related were significantly-enriched. Network analysis uncovered a central role of MYC, TP53, and CTNNB1 in controlling expression of DEG highly-expressed in PAR vs. MFP. Similar analysis suggested a central role for PPARG, KLF2, EGR2, and EPAS1 in regulating expression of more highly-expressed DEG in MFP vs. PAR. Gene network analyses revealed putative inter-tissue crosstalk between cytokines and growth factors preferentially expressed in one tissue (e.g., ANGPTL1, SPP1, IL1B in PAR vs. MFP; ADIPOQ, IL13, FGF2, LEP in MFP vs. PAR) with DEG preferentially expressed in the other tissue, particularly transcription factors or pathways (e.g., MYC, TP53, and actin cytoskeletal signaling in PAR vs. MFP; PPARG and LXR/RXR Signaling in MFP vs. PAR).ConclusionsFunctional analyses underscored a reciprocal influence in determining the biological features of MFP and PAR during neonatal development. This was exemplified by the potential effect that the signaling molecules (cytokines, growth factors) released preferentially (i.e., more highly-expressed) by PAR or MFP could have on molecular functions or signaling pathways enriched in the MFP or PAR. These bidirectional interactions might be required to coordinate mammary tissue development under normal circumstances or in response to nutrition.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paola Piantoni"", ids = ""47784055""); list(name = ""Massimo Bionaz"", ids = ""50559748""); list(name = ""D E Graugnard"", ids = ""5489281""); list(name = ""Kristy Marie Daniels"", ids = ""7876164""); list(name = ""Robin E.

Although investigation of specific lncRNAs revealed their role in the metabolism of cellular RNA, our understanding of their contribution to post-transcriptional regulation is relatively limited. In this study, we explore the role of lncRNAs in modulating alternative splicing and their impact on downstream protein-RNA interaction networks. Analysis of alternative splicing events across 39 lncRNA knockdown and wildtype RNA-sequencing datasets from three human cell lines-HeLa (cervical cancer), K562 (myeloid leukemia), and U87 (glioblastoma)-resulted in the high-confidence (false discovery rate (fdr) < 0.01) identification of 11,630 skipped exon events and 5895 retained intron events, implicating 759 genes to be impacted at the post-transcriptional level due to the loss of lncRNAs. We observed that a majority of the alternatively spliced genes in a lncRNA knockdown were specific to the cell type. In tandem, the functions annotated to the genes affected by alternative splicing across each lncRNA knockdown also displayed cell-type specificity. To understand the mechanism behind this cell-type-specific alternative splicing pattern, we analyzed RNA-binding protein (RBP)-RNA interaction profiles across the spliced regions in order to observe cell-type-specific alternative splice event RBP binding preference. Despite limited RBP binding data across cell lines, alternatively spliced events detected in lncRNA perturbation experiments were associated with RBPs binding in proximal intron-exon junctions in a cell-type-specific manner. The cellular functions affected by alternative splicing were also affected in a cell-type-specific manner. Based on the RBP binding profiles in HeLa and K562 cells, we hypothesize that several lncRNAs are likely to exhibit a sponge effect in disease contexts, resulting in the functional disruption of RBPs and their downstream functions. We propose that such lncRNA sponges can extensively rewire post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks by altering the protein-RNA interaction landscape in a cell-type-specific manner.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Felipe Wendt Porto"", ids = ""151002668""); list(name = ""Swapna Vidhur Daulatabad"", ids = ""81821080""); list(name = ""Sarath Chandra Janga"", ids = ""2189501"")",33fd5fba974898e19caaee41fa781ef3105190fb; 063e4d21328c69aed7231ea578322251f8081b9c,bf274d4a8c09d35ea33ed7588b6226613fb103f2; 4228f2c2c69e24368e4acb1938d0087361065777; 8175c92d67b8143e32e60de088390e42f0d64d45; 78028bf1cfd79558136a33d8b6a00e277460842e; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; 3642c2f0a040b0170fd889b96bfb3eead48967e5; 8f5dc49ac122545c3af0139d8aba67382969698f; 80456d62ffa47d726f84530f34688ca948c289fa; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; d8bd861b292233072aa40ab6bc029ac94d7f30af; 176490c7bbb20b5a64aca49d9dc3b75bdfd76d67; c311290b84a92d8f1db2ee1f22620731bccd6c60; c0450f920c178d25e7707fa00432516fa6a96ce5; 4cb7638f15e93fcc3842f9d5fd7976b1997f8e03; 3c80e1c07ea3d94e38c1b5a35f91364f3142c5a8; edca2e595b3ba418fcaa3e13e66d81e51cf7e10a; 8f95b02dff640424b9af98efe21235a2f1d2518a; af4d8da0241c382d9c524db5429ea7ae71dfd33a; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 6353d19a4bf6b314be0cae15b476363a4d49216f; e5ff4e2a1599d9c56e2245954b9957ac50173758; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 96e8d4b9275f732cc9e40411ee595d4d58678469; a2e5cb4898ff903d425f096ecf9a82074a855c9b; 113ed2b0bcf366911118576b6855ecb441c4987a; 6a3370364f3ed590fc7556e857a3767e27a8075e; c8093ffa784705eb4408c777e7fade543da79017; 3fbb9d7ebc41764917611aae13124ff3c295ea5c; 5cfa393e32dbc0003c903ee98cb424022cd581f4; 029f8af725228701aaeeda9decd7187bfe05a089; cff093b1f514096668bc78c0f3b53706ee912c64; 116d59421aaf76f2768f737a1006e8c5afb05d8e; 12ea983976c0a5d7257a16ac7243d2a5a3856ce8; 2f02e3c59d9a653227f0ccc71a5ccb088e0214ec; 75cf364442ba0321580312ad061a691898788a13; f34897c8d816d11a98a7f2f8408d322021043234; f20206c5494f75ede79d710ab437396ec0c756fc; c7fe5dc4f9600cfb54b1b15b1d2b77717df4541e; d4096e52e8710c00b3eb700c8fa007d4f88b7119; 56b68018a721140a677b423054aee0c4aa1bc041; b82759e2255f75426381dbf854c1db643c96ff9b; d932d8a54b9decd7cc93fbdb4123adda3f754445; 745379ca25ea3d01c3224d409d46c722d405fc8e; a19724bd91e956b67780fca06a146bd3ccfb0017,Genes,10,
8090f79c2423e8e8cac3f5298b8d36663a2f0188,Dynamic transcriptome sequencing and analysis during early development in the bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis),"BackgroundEarly development is a key process of the life history of fish. However, the relationship between the transcriptome and the dynamic regulation of early development is still uncharacterized in the bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). In the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of six development stages in H. nobilis, aiming to understand the dynamic molecular regulation of early development in this fish.ResultsA total of 76,573 unigenes were assembled from clean sequence reads, with an average length of 1768 base. Among which, 41,742 (54.54%) unigenes were annotated to public protein databases, and an additional 59,014 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were identified among the unigenes. Furthermore, 30,199 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) (fold change >â€‰4 orâ€‰<â€‰0.25, and the false discovery rate FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01) were observed in comparisons between the adjacent developmental stages, and nine expression patterns (profiles) were simulated using series-cluster analysis across six developmental stages. The unigenes expression level markedly increased after the DS1 stage (early blastula), and the numbers of DETs gradually decreased during subsequent development. The largest transcriptomic change (up- or down-regulated) was detected during the period from DS1 to DS2 (6-somite stage), which was enriched for many biological processes and metabolic pathways related to maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). Distinctly protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were plotted for DETs during the period from DS1 to DS2. The genes (or proteins) from the same pathways were integrated together, and showed with obvious co-regulation patterns. In the series-cluster analysis, a remarkable profile of gene expression (profile_48) was identified that is probably related to the hatching during H. nobilis development, and the strict co-expression of a hatching enzyme gene (hce1) with 33 other annotated genes was identified from this profile.ConclusionsThe results indicated that strict dynamic regulation occurs during the early development in H. nobilis, especially in embryogenesis before hatching. This study provides valuable new information and transcriptomic resources related to H. nobilis early development, and for certain events such as MZT and hatching.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jianjun Fu"", ids = ""50763759""); list(name = ""Wenbin Zhu"", ids = ""144515446""); list(name = ""Lan-mei Wang"", ids = ""48169570""); list(name = ""Mingkun Luo"", ids = ""79548963""); list(name = ""Feibiao Song"", ids = ""151004187""); list(name = ""Zaijie Dong"", ids = ""3698597"")",0118ec18e4102e65b555490caf9344cbf21912f0,266f45c8f60a6ce4b5bdaab16b4e93b6810b27e6; c97a6af3a2d0213e994dffbb4d6eb9cddd1b93c3; 1efa950513f32b4d46699af72dbcf6b2e0c4502d; b46946948bf7b9a60ca4316686825a0214c1aa9f; b55dd350d4f7bd0fd96b4b52a57caa8f7e2b85e3; ac721f359f88afc22e05f2669cba970a7a2e99e8; 4a527fe11e75b864421ee0064d51994495c7d10d; 25edb1fcb18e3dd979dba83d77c9241f17e8fa14; a97118927d448c53ae006298ac4d8bb5ca508bb1; 21366618864660f1f3a32836a58c432e782f1bbf; 9b685c9e933e292d3e4319d055863f9af6b680ce; bd420cb14de962e9018675b174f4eb92af297395; c60ddc7bca41a098c18375fc9addc9ff041edf03; c307409d4aace679985816a76f70a46b6bde3e31; 5b64cf6b90a67ae60769b75a2709850023fe194b; a2f60ebd9c3e79c8fedfe61c5c79a1f8742339d6; 96ba9207861aac344176bf0da0278e77c6531405; 00b02ad03265df961cf024a2894373f8217c4069; d6afc8493a65c865ef272080bb94e753d22970a4; e19fcd4236d0def74ed7ff6a31e23d7035cd89c3; 16d4ba9cc1d46d452a40ba7faae870a1c4a36cc0; 8cd067a33e3f7030a00334555866d9a7f4d37571; b7ee12d199986798aafb43526f88112b6b0d430e; edaf1569fb904e022425996ec6ee1416bda053ec; a0436fc2001f681e465c87b478f35798fe56c4fe; cc90910b6e31fe44cddc1e341f21eec0aaa5db44; 049bb90a8201921c979e6658a492b33ab855facd; 65a49d84119ff077dc3903d9552b090f6e25e9e9; fff4ed57bcefc3e681d92e57dd511d686d11fd90; 87ed32760c25e9cfce0fa4027c08f85f697c2fb3; 3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70; 62dd303abec651cbf4f3722215f43385dbdf6127; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; cac5980b4c78a0dab29817d599bb4ff96edc65ea; 12032b65e555aa9900560dc7d1fdedabbbd6bfb4; b9d26450520aa98e6ccb1b2e11a48fec29f273b9; 6e806ba4d67238ab5a4b5c8600445b61a43397df; 5f28108df2cad19d0874ab97406a1e3ed501f315; ec31c509556e822e21340e1f450e5a169e3c9d73; 2d0c6bb69f0aef6d7285df7689f115378a153970; 407ebcc2ba1b61f195dfa9b55d69eb87593161fe; 9ddab0dd9d88cf4d3405ceb6576efa593027ef4d; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 8081453fc130a92ead85549e6220e8da72c7280a; a0e3d5d30945f5c1f6d03e15773e819a2eb0ad07; 6ea9c9acfc277b436fdf07b12a875b03fbbc1ca5; a5134023648ced35293eb1a0914ef8cebf1930ae; 59fe59e1f6e006cf0747f75c7d79e8cb504abd21; d0d4b66f5bf840575d07c2aeb7b6f5c976c4fe81; 6720484a48b2545f2dd63602c52a26bc72ca7c0c; 36fd7452209e4a2ced2128c89a631711a5f2e60b; 19aac30d77dd30368f6043f150a848726b12726e; e509a8da9681bc76753c3e1da45f4874474b0ad8; d50458c350897b517ac409a568b941e13f071e76; 7d71935e7ef10352942bae2a5f9579ade9921705; 62433c4995b46ab888d9086568a327a4e1ab75ef; c0254ac26e71a579ecde24906d95cf11f20c74bd; 68c3058bfc67a912f326f08e6ba9ee9ba2f5d987; 0abc70c009e50f05e35f409c9c678bcd9bb8eaae; 76f9934965c2f5684c11e53158981a3968aa1c46; 75736c1854e6701a8595762005fa43e399f4dca9; 826ede65d9a5b6f2d567b2d8c604a0e25688298a; b6f7434a22090fc25617f0041d4709fd9141f2b0,BMC Genomics,20,
2f24dbb826f18a9105d87ce62886b57068c7eab5,Quick calculation for sample size while controlling false discovery rate with application to microarray analysis,"MOTIVATION
Sample size calculation is important in experimental design and is even more so in microarray or proteomic experiments since only a few repetitions can be afforded. In the multiple testing problems involving these experiments, it is more powerful and more reasonable to control false discovery rate (FDR) or positive FDR (pFDR) instead of type I error, e.g. family-wise error rate (FWER). When controlling FDR, the traditional approach of estimating sample size by controlling type I error is no longer applicable.


RESULTS
Our proposed method applies to controlling FDR. The sample size calculation is straightforward and requires minimal computation, as illustrated with two sample t-tests and F-tests. Based on simulation with the resultant sample size, the power is shown to be achievable by the q-value procedure.

In the present study we investigated the plasma inflammatory profile in severely impaired chronic pain patients. In addition we studied if there were any alterations in inflammation patterns at one-year follow up, after the patients had taken part in a CBT-ACT based 4 weeks in-hospital pain rehabilitation program (PRP). Methods Blood samples were collected from 52 well characterized chronic pain patients. Plasma from matched healthy blood donors were used as controls. At one year after the treatment program, 28 of the patients were available for follow up. Instead of only analyzing single inflammation-related substances, we used a new multiplex panel enabling the simultaneous analysis of 92 inflammation-related proteins, mainly cytokines and chemokines (Proseek Inflammation, Olink, Uppsala, Sweden). Multivariate statistics were used for analysis. Results Clear signs of increased inflammatory activity were detected in the pain patients. Accepting a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, there were significant differences in 43 of the 92 inflammatory biomarkers. The expression of 8 biomarkers were 4 times higher in patients compared to controls. Three biomarkers, CXCL5, SIRT2, AXIN1 were more than 8 times higher. The conventional marker for inflammation, CRP, did not differ. Of the 28 patients available for follow up one year after the intervention, all showed lower levels of the inflammatory biomarker initially raised. Conclusions The results indicate that CPP suffer from a low grade of chronic systemic inflammation, not detectable by CRP analysis. This may have implications for the general pain hypersensitivity, and other symptoms, often described in this group of patients. We conclude that inflammatory plasma proteins may be measureable molecular markers to distinguishes CPP from pain free controls, and that a CBT-ACT pain rehab program seem to decrease this inflammatory activity.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""E-B Hysing"", ids = ""46195052""); list(name = ""Lena Smith"", ids = ""79828653""); list(name = ""MÃ¥ns Thulin"", ids = ""10250373""); list(name = ""Rolf Karlsten"", ids = ""3998941""); list(name = ""Torsten E Gordh"", ids = ""4550651"")",e37ce084232f25088b9db53a48f2d4b0161c6ede,,Scandinavian Journal of Pain,16,175 - 176
6cba8b457ea7520357ade5d24d393004d36765f6,A theoretical foundation of the target-decoy search strategy for false discovery rate control in proteomics,"Motivation: Target-decoy search (TDS) is currently the most popular strategy for estimating and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) of peptide identifications in mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics. While this strategy is very useful in practice and has been intensively studied empirically, its theoretical foundation has not yet been well established. Result: In this work, we systematically analyze the TDS strategy in a rigorous statistical sense. We prove that the commonly used concatenated TDS provides a conservative estimate of the FDR for any given score threshold, but it cannot rigorously control the FDR. We prove that with a slight modification to the commonly used formula for FDR estimation, the peptide-level FDR can be rigorously controlled based on the concatenated TDS. We show that the spectrum-level FDR control is difficult. We verify the theoretical conclusions with real mass spectrometry data.",2015,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kun He"", ids = ""145905326""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""144252268""); list(name = ""Wen-Feng Zeng"", ids = ""47137506""); list(name = ""Lan Luo"", ids = ""145630535""); list(name = ""H.

6ed3c5763989ed1be676b6db94f68f424f2cbb36,A three-stage genome-wide association study combining multilocus test and gene expression analysis for young-onset hypertension in Taiwan Han Chinese.,"BACKGROUND
Although many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed, only a few studies have successfully identified replicable, large-impact hypertension loci; even fewer studies have been done on Chinese subjects. Young-onset hypertension (YOH) is considered to be a more promising target disorder to investigate than late-onset hypertension because of its stronger genetic component.


METHODS
To map YOH genetic variants, we performed a 3-stage study combining 1st-stage multilocus GWASs, 2nd-stage gene expression analysis, and 3rd-stage multilocus confirmatory study.


RESULTS
In the 1st stage, Illumina550K data from 400 case-control pairs were used, and 22 genes flanked by 14 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) septets (P values adjusted for false discovery rate (pFDR) < 3.16Ã—10(-7)) were identified. In the 2nd stage, differential gene expression analysis was carried out for these genes, and 5 genes were selected (pFDR < 0.05). In the 3rd stage, we re-examined the finding with an independent set of 592 case-control pairs and with the joint samples (n = 992 case-control pairs). A total of 6 SNP septets flanking C1orf135, GSN, LARS, and ACTN4 remained significant in all 3 stages. Among them, the same septet flanking ACTN4 was also associated with blood pressure traits in the Hong Kong Hypertension Study (HKHS) and in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium Hypertension Study (WTCCCHS). LARS was detected in the HKHS, but not in the WTCCCHS. GSN may be specific to Taiwanese individuals because it was not found by either the HKHS or the WTCCCHS.

0d2ef58d5760e32bb1893f0bd8ee1dbe3601f5e5,Feasibility of urinary microRNA profiling detection in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and its potential as a non-invasive biomarker,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), a pregnancy-related liver disease, leads to complications for both mother and fetus. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as candidate biomarkers for many diseases. So far, the circulating miRNAs profiling of ICP has not been investigated. To assess the urinary miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for ICP, a differential miRNA profiling was initially analyzed by individual quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay in urinary samples from a screening set including 10 ICP and 10 healthy pregnancies. The selected candidate miRNAs were then validated by a validation set with 40 ICP and 50 healthy pregnancies using individual qRT-PCR assay. Compared with the expression in urine of healthy pregnant women, the expression levels of hsa-miR-151-3p and hsa-miR-300 were significantly down-regulated, whereas hsa-miR-671-3p and hsa-miR-369-5p were significantly up-regulated in urine from ICP patients (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). A binary logistic regression model was constructed using the four miRNAs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.913 (95% confidence intervalâ€‰=â€‰0.847 to 0.980; sensitivityâ€‰=â€‰82.9%, specificityâ€‰=â€‰87.0%). Therefore, urinary microRNA profiling detection in ICP is feasible and maternal urinary miRNAs have the potential to be non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of ICP.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Li Ma"", ids = ""144189134""); list(name = ""Xiao-qing Zhang"", ids = ""2610083""); list(name = ""Da-Xue Zhou"", ids = ""4622682""); list(name = ""Yue Cui"", ids = ""143918455""); list(name = ""Lin-lin Deng"", ids = ""6346704""); list(name = ""Ting Yang"", ids = ""143790735""); list(name = ""Yong Shao"", ids = ""145979294""); list(name = ""Min Ding"", ids = ""2045134"")",0aa24100d4db3795eda4272c0d85b715efbae162; 8cc1cecf1a502eb7c0638aa23c2f6fc94096f484; e80e4b7b50e4152f875b3987ba0a65e3446d06d9; 8885d1a6ccabaff3f6cc5c642596e183c6fe4fd5; 394c243a33121f29fbce9017792e75328087772a; 722c84089912bb79787861322d143849c29f3542; 643eef243f3283061c064c2bbcc9874d1dd0239b; 02f9d4c9524838e7f9dbdc44d1a0848eb3766d88; 109e575a2cf511e8e8863081113838bd69ed20d2; 67779d3a05284018ecdbcdf2a2f8efb9a8d70f5e,c93b9b8dea5de555c15dfd82571c01a592f00fa6; 217f78751bf6a090ba5bc73ecc8b02af1e71bf6b; c954baa6eeb1f712aae2fc2a3a8ca31c1f77d6aa; 52ef16843bf591ffbb1fb32e8394f3ab4e103ddd; a69f115d6443a5ce967e622e0dfdf0035be98e13; 9ae050b14fbc8ce9eaa5dfa52b38e584b5affbcd; 743cdf2e2c70160fa510353ddffc91714f7232ff; b641f264b557d215c1d39325725f9e6a1e329523; 88c8ff6265a9ed8e14f0d11d1ab70898a859a6c2; bd3c457acaad2ff19ae317767f0349c7eb814e07; 9add8d761a554a42e409f4c6bb6af28b3979f41b; c1fe9977e27635e730b1516b80a743ac9f3d2ba6; 1c7abe8b5d4e4146bd2fd37d5203bc778f909d65; 9827cce04f975d46c4239e5dfd2dfd2592ad3e47; bde35f33a064dd08b4cf2cbc523a3fb110cb0efa; 77aa3e7f4064dd053b2d20c58d03006ebf871ac8; 11e5069353d889e64fbd212ccb18f38b2d3efce6; 147f0d0cbee20bea49aedfd3b1c2773d967ab682; 2d9ccd95ef75861ada84a34b2e6ad4f3347fd59d; c872c95a9970e6ac30e6508b7dcd0df8c3636651; 43443d82ff2dc9ce5b58c8f5f5cc65a91b2c5c40; 1c30b5b9173a884d780332d6867117a63001ac77; b2aa8a8b7245d1bbc48cc4c8fc278b6fc51ca3c0; 6472976055f0c0b83d96157b9ace5db16134a3dc; 191fcd89bba8383029613fcdfe4f65464bb43aa8; 95135349f407bf58bbf6f377350217c0193ec238; 076cfb133f80fa0e6c16b464f203e73064b9a7db; 22e393a8aeb2b8f46d36d662a1bd590f85d0eed6; 5ce8fea696148d01fdcd2620f49d8f7b54fff2b1; 0fde3ebd65f41cc2220446a0d79011fbdc2d37a3; 41dd7e884883b47f31c566450bc7c132c6bee4ff; 227d945351234920450b1d35bf5104a31a89e60e; 504c470a4da7458be426d7ee7b27386ea9655bb0; 82ed8e3657c9dfd561cbf5a62a3141196e8b60ec; 574040efa428e866e1ba74967a321e39cd70f539; 5c433af93a6509f78d06b7472bcbaa3c4fcfaa50; 3c1960de1d4d58c5f705cbf4f80381b7d024b159; 42634c3921ea5272c7c14db7d1db7273f9c7f117; a993c419c7279b7d6064bf82e2bc3a98040e2f53; 766e0aa0c78df598a9cf83d060219780ae36631d; 1fdbc0e2eb22c68cd19541c1e35b8b7bc6748297; dd8cfc290b64842dffb36f83ac7d2d154faab2a2; 7f95e2132e4a075ec914eb2f0abe24683a9b355b; 45f2236524844905164a2f558ef617a6f0c1c508; d46fcc89adce91f1324fbb08a788268548e9cc7d,Scientific Reports,6,
5257fc710f791d63c1e1e01f77673b3ae16a2358,Chemo-response biomarker discovery via expression profiling using soft-tissue sarcoma xenografts.,"9569 Background: Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) constitute a heterogeneous group of tumours of mesenchymal origin. Whereas the mainstay of treatment has been surgery and radiation, these tumours are generally considered as quite chemoresistant. However, it is well known that subgroups of patients benefit from chemotherapy. Markers that could predict drug response would therefore be beneficial for the management of this malignancy. We have previously established panel of 17 unique human soft tissue xenografts, representing 7 different histological subgroups and assessed their responsiveness to doxorubicin, ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin. We wanted to utilize these xenografts as a model system to discover for novel candidate marker genes for STS chemo-response.


METHODS
GE Uniset Human 20K microarrays were used to obtain gene expression profiles from the each xenografts. One-way ANOVA test with a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple test correction allowing a false discovery rate of 5% was used to identify genes with significantly differential expression.


RESULTS
Doxorubicin, ifosfamide, etoposide and cisplatin were efficient in 6/17, 10/17, 1/17 and 7/17 xenografts respectively. However, in the expression profiles obtained none of the genes showed significantly correlation with chemo-responsiveness to any of the drugs. Two of the xenografts, TAX 1 and TAX 2, both originate from a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) in the same patient, but show strikingly different sensitivity to ifosfamide (TAX1 resistant, TAX2 sensitive). When triplicate hybridizations of TAX1 and 2 were compared, 294 genes met the above criteria. In addition we identified a subset of 122 genes that were flagged absent in one of the specimens, present in the other. Among genes with an already described role in mediating drug resistance are GST-pi and glutathione peroxidase. Taken together, these results indicate that discovery of general response markers in STSs may be difficult due to the heterogeneity of the different subgroups constituting this malignancy.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression profiling of the TAX 1 and TAX 2 xenografts revealed a number of interesting candidate marker genes for ifosfamide sensitivity of MFH. This list of genes will be further refined by validation in clinical samples.

A powerful statistical framework for estimating such networks is Gaussian graphical models, but standard estimators for the corresponding graphs are prone to large numbers of false discoveries. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph estimator based on knockoffs that imitate the partial correlation structures of unconnected nodes.

Our setting is different from the standard Euclidean/large same asymptotic framework, yet highly relevant to realistic experimental circumstances for some important areas of application in astronomy. More precisely, we focus on cases where a single realization of a smooth isotropic Gaussian random field on the sphere is observed, and a number of well-localized signals are superimposed on such background field.

94d2d0f040193e09f7aa99541d657e4cc223a64a,Decreased left posterior insular activity during auditory language in autism.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often exhibit atypical language patterns, including delay of speech onset, literal speech interpretation, and poor recognition of social and emotional cues in speech. We acquired functional MR images during an auditory language task to evaluate systematic differences in language-network activation between control and high-functioning autistic populations.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Forty-one right-handed male subjects (26 high-functioning autistic subjects, 15 controls) were studied by using an auditory phrase-recognition task, and areas of differential activation between groups were identified. Hand preference, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), age, and language-function testing were included as covariables in the analysis.


RESULTS
Control and autistic subjects showed similar language-activation networks, with 2 notable differences. Control subjects showed significantly increased activation in the left posterior insula compared with autistic subjects (P < .05, false discovery rate), and autistic subjects showed increased bilaterality of receptive language compared with control subjects. Higher receptive-language scores on standardized testing were associated with greater activation of the posterior aspect of the left Wernicke area. A higher verbal IQ was associated with greater activation of the bilateral Broca area and involvement of the prefrontal cortex and lateral premotor cortex.


CONCLUSIONS
Control subjects showed greater activation of the posterior insula during receptive language, which may correlate with impaired emotive processing of language in autism. Subjects with autism showed greater bilateral activation of receptive-language areas, which was out of proportion to the differences in hand preference in autism and control populations.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey S.

0304380da7f07487d68697b08a366585dcde766f,"Genetically distinct clinical subsets, and associations with asthma and eosinophil abundance, within Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis","Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA: formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a rare inflammatory disease of unknown cause. 30% of patients have anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) specific for myeloperoxidase (MPO). We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of EGPA, testing 7.5 million genetic variants in 684 cases and 6,838 controls. Case-control analyses were performed for EGPA as a whole, and stratified by ANCA. To increase power, we used a conditional false discovery rate method to leverage findings from GWASs of related phenotypes. In total, 11 variants were associated with EGPA, two specifically with ANCA-negative EGPA, and one (HLA-DQ) with MPO+ANCA EGPA. Many variants were associated with asthma, eosinophilic and immune-mediated diseases and, strikingly, nine were associated with eosinophil count in the general population. Through Mendelian randomisation, we show that a primary tendency to eosinophilia underlies EGPA susceptibility. We demonstrate that EGPA comprises two genetically and clinically distinct syndromes, with ANCA-negative EGPA genetically more similar to asthma. MPO+ ANCA EGPA is an eosinophilic autoimmune disease sharing certain clinical features and an MHC association with MPO+ ANCA-associated vasculitis, while ANCA-negative EGPA may instead have a mucosal/barrier dysfunction origin. Five identified candidate genes are targets of therapies in development, supporting their exploration in EGPA.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Paul A.

099ac25552ec8792eed20cca411763a098e1249c,Genetic polymorphisms associated with psoriasis and development of psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis,"BACKGROUND
Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic inflammatory disease with predominantly cutaneous manifestations. Approximately one third of patients with PsO develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), whereas the remaining proportion of patients has isolated cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). These two phenotypes share common immunology, but with different heredity that might in part be explained by genetic variables.


METHODS
Using a candidate gene approach, we studied 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 37 genes that regulate inflammation. In total, we assessed 480 patients with PsO from DERMBIO, of whom 151 had PsC for 10 years or more (PsC10), 459 patients with PsA from DANBIO, and 795 healthy controls. Using logistic regression analysis, crude and adjusted for age and gender, we assessed associations between genetic variants and PsO, PsC10, and PsA, as well as associations between genetic variants and development of PsA in PsO.


RESULTS
Eleven polymorphisms in 10 genes were nominally associated with PsO and/or PsC and/or PsA (P < 0.05). After correction for multiple testing with a false discovery rate of 5%, two SNPs remained significant: TNF (rs361525) was associated with PsO, PsC10, and PsA; and IL12B (rs6887695) was associated with PsO.


CONCLUSION
Among a cohort of Danish patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, two SNPs in the IL12B and TNF genes were associated with susceptibility of psoriasis. None of the SNPs were specifically associated with isolated cutaneous psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nikolai Dyrberg Loft"", ids = ""7433565""); list(name = ""Lone Skov"", ids = ""2998768""); list(name = ""M Rasmussen"", ids = ""144585708""); list(name = ""Robert Gniadecki"", ids = ""49153294""); list(name = ""Tomas Norman Dam"", ids = ""152120447""); list(name = ""Ivan Brandslund"", ids = ""6740893""); list(name = ""Hans JÃ¼rgen Hoffmann"", ids = ""145961419""); list(name = ""Malene Rohr Andersen"", ids = ""6729047""); list(name = ""Ram Benny Dessau"", ids = ""3346502""); list(name = ""Ann Christina Bergmann"", ids = ""27682867""); list(name = ""Niels MÃ¸ller Andersen"", ids = ""39514741""); list(name = ""Mikkel Kramme Abildtoft"", ids = ""35472541""); list(name = ""Paal Skytt Andersen"", ids = ""1849071""); list(name = ""Merete Lund Hetland"", ids = ""5418959""); list(name = ""Bente Glintborg"", ids = ""3602039""); list(name = ""Steffen Bank"", ids = ""33601752""); list(name = ""Ulla Vogel"", ids = ""144223944""); list(name = ""Vibeke Andersen"", ids = ""145244118"")",18e0ff4a6503855b6efc9735aa5e9c4523122e1a; 26ae0e2d9c499df186021aa58fdfc3b0917c2f26; 6d6f159590fb322af29ef6953a0fbab609f74e97; 2ac9ee40cf5574699a18d6ac0cf84b5b5911e16d; 4f052f670b3694d0d96ce6cc769db8863713a831; 9ff0723e24a56c53680df7b2e70b6d7f4e580b16; 6ce50abf311696791d5c9c1f93e3839fa299feaf; 25d3b41db8ed6cdc08f2c76c8f0f59e2e552505e; d52ff1712269c77be7f9a52599e5d035c808c7e8; 9a1f980cff6ebafd17cdbed866d91ed571de8ba9,6cd1f70956a8efb629d4c0f08edbe53e218c282c; e2338778e8c88fe2e68cfe9f49a624eacdd2009d; 44d8fbc9fc456e40b858d2603d5c006e6a872065; a81d924bbe5d1dfff6277469a616347483ccb7cc; 7d61984596f6f43d6a151fc420a63a83ad45f3d2; 887ebf41c3d1bc2a5c99b65fefb58618e0ae85cf; 1cda86aa8a91469734183e22dfbe22b28853c35c; e4cfc4e8cd088d704234929ef7f871d52df453aa; af7899b3e830f4d4d7b39ace302305052580f35a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 80185ef67604e185277a5fca8a2ac5d3fe842662; 5365c78510286d4eef2b68eb28127b6ebd1e224f; bbf8e8910c7611caeb6e3f0dfa2ed8aaf683f89e; 1a400b62086472ca06e7f06da583cb6a0a30c559; 048d541241800db235b8da93d4ea66aa9ebedaa2; b86357c724fe016fb0881a86f44fef3f6d8b702c; 8ce26c9eb0a7e397fced533779a5255d08987993; 5836cb8bd5a5b12160c198f770e22eabe49315b0; ce4ecdfa7bb483c619eba1da934b3042c3d05c46; 59e9e1059e7d8cc9a8e95a1994b0f23392cee3eb; c7033c8ed18da803f65de5d68fa3674d08e4a749; c4c888dd4ed16756ed4a308bec70ffbd1f8496dc; d8a0dbc4f1168cb358db9dd9dfbd088aa298e7fd; 0c4a964b5e7dcd66d03baa45f41cf1d1dbe53242; 29c0a64c08ee7444f00a6013a5eb2d2b45026084; cf3e82a8040bf853c0fccfc3be54ed178866b269; 9e46d92573269f9298ebd4e3596d1b3df0c87bce; 4d44ddbf532da5513876534e8fb8067056ebee03; 47d691aeae1ac50143bc43021d281f963b3f9864; f397c202c3a9f1e519149d75c76b614483810f36; 8503e4519daeeaf209410fc8b94e7ac75b5442ea; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; 22cd5569b1409a5da572b396d6f585d2e5eec41d; 9f99dc75fa189969039d61450599d29541378800; b56085e448736589bdfca70d6e2f5e34be587ca8; 7eb47e871809a7dcde90450d336319c26e26559e; 2a7ce2c532eb8c04e8ad12cdeedb739dca010142; eb8eedcf48d29db0f6593c3aadd12e7d77e12348; 16fefff305f33a394f4272920e941bd4fb040afe; 9c415d415b7f54db7e92b9023450044dc7c5122c; 0614e2fd67dbdafd9e33636e4bef6cd6f51c1882; 99c453caf00d3e287d04f2f32381e984419b40ae; a36f84d640df1a1d7a8a5697e6f8a52e8146e16d; 726fa26f5029de39d8616267a29c54c92267f900; 9659c5370b8c5019796f51e5c1a91fdbe4151833; 7f3f8f59af52d765935fc732a7f3d84201765083; 9da00a85c01f7a851b84b1b4a1f7f3ceedfa788e; 3027fa2d61fe561a3854d3ad3c3989996b444ec1; 073adb42adbcc5bafdd8bf666c1baaba8f8e0480; 1554f818f530bdca9295dc36ada9949a0b2df7ee; 40cecda82db29bb3c7dc9f8a970fb51653508504; e8660b467039f80b50cded0ca9298fae9c5554a0; a904cb3e4726d4f251adb7c373a2b95732640c78; 1c5ba0012b1574c227f6f23fc8523392f30e07a6; e287850153677739bb41d3817b78fbd667c1c4cd; 94d6d722bd7535d9cda061e266dc3c165d19567b,PLoS ONE,13,
c6253603206a7423d43d8fc2a0e52fab90c0e3be,A Method for Gene-Based Pathway Analysis Using Genomewide Association Study Summary Statistics Reveals Nine New Type 1 Diabetes Associations,"Pathway analysis can complement point-wise single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in exploring genomewide association study (GWAS) data to identify specific disease-associated genes that can be candidate causal genes. We propose a straightforward methodology that can be used for conducting a gene-based pathway analysis using summary GWAS statistics in combination with widely available reference genotype data. We used this method to perform a gene-based pathway analysis of a type 1 diabetes (T1D) meta-analysis GWAS (of 7,514 cases and 9,045 controls). An important feature of the conducted analysis is the removal of the major histocompatibility complex gene region, the major genetic risk factor for T1D. Thirty-one of the 1,583 (2%) tested pathways were identified to be enriched for association with T1D at a 5% false discovery rate. We analyzed these 31 pathways and their genes to identify SNPs in or near these pathway genes that showed potentially novel association with T1D and attempted to replicate the association of 22 SNPs in additional samples. Replication P-values were skewed (P=9.85Ã—10-11) with 12 of the 22 SNPs showing P<0.05. Support, including replication evidence, was obtained for nine T1D associated variants in genes ITGB7 (rs11170466, P=7.86Ã—10-9), NRP1 (rs722988, 4.88Ã—10-8), BAD (rs694739, 2.37Ã—10-7), CTSB (rs1296023, 2.79Ã—10-7), FYN (rs11964650, P=5.60Ã—10-7), UBE2G1 (rs9906760, 5.08Ã—10-7), MAP3K14 (rs17759555, 9.67Ã—10-7), ITGB1 (rs1557150, 1.93Ã—10-6), and IL7R (rs1445898, 2.76Ã—10-6).

96a49f9cf3c5a3a29ecfb8e0858c7e5f959b91b2,Sample Size and Power Analysis for Microarray Studies,"This document shows the functionality of the R-package SSPA. The package performs the power and sample size analysis method as described by [2, 3]. Our implementation allows for fast and realistic estimates of power and sample size for microarray experiments, given pilot data. By means of two simple commands (pilotData(), sampleSize()), a researcher can read their data in and compute the desired estimates. Other functions are provided to facilitate interpretation of results. Given a set of test statistics from the pilot data, the knowledge of their distribution under the null hypothesis and the sample size used to compute them, the method estimates the power for a given false discovery rate. The multiple testing problem is controlled through the adaptive version of the Benjamini and Hochberg method [1]. For more details about the implementation and method we refer to [9, 2, 3]. In [8] we describe two biological case studies using the package SSPA. For comparison we implement the power and sample size estimation method proposed by Ruppert [6] which uses a different estimation approach.

af0c89f747ddf620ca0f2b53c0303a75aaa1afd9,Estimation of the proportion of true null hypotheses in high-dimensional data under dependence,"In multiple testing, a challenging issue is to provide an accurate estimation of the proportion @p""0 of true null hypotheses among the whole set of tests. Besides a biological interpretation, this parameter is involved in the control of error rates such as the False Discovery Rate. Improving its estimation can result in more powerful/less conservative methods of differential analysis. Various methods for @p""0 estimation have been previously developed. Most of them rely on the assumption of independent p-values distributed according to a two-component mixture model, with a uniform distribution for null p-values. In a general factor analytic framework, the impact of dependence on the properties of the estimation procedures is first investigated and exact expressions of bias and variance are provided in case of dependent data. A more accurate factor-adjusted estimator of @p""0 is finally presented, which shows large improvements with respect to the standard procedures.",2011,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""ChloÃ© Friguet"", ids = ""2545540""); list(name = ""David Causeur"", ids = ""2234785"")",eb0ccfd325145e16cc51d00168c9fb69a623eca9; b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c; 963536bf9f586569e75888c0363ced3df4750b8b; 30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e; bcf15c2c260517184b73321727f287fe0be92ebd; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c; c9a7bb3bf94c1421bf4957af43bd2167c3e02d8f; 86007b78b5b3ed7ab7f982ed3e6d80b12a44cc08; 70f46efa761b2acda257e9675794e843c8dd48d9; 522a22f15190643e99bdd4a14357665443216260; a28c02d7128658ffa6b465230fb4c306f62e9ccc; d3fbc69e2b7ed7d184bb1b6ffbb5ea370319816e,,Comput.

The FWER makes sense when we are testing a small number of hypotheses. For example, in comparing six or ten different treatments, it is very reasonable to control the probability of returning even one ineffective treatment. The consequences of a false discovery may be severe, and even so strong a criterion as FWER control can leave us with high power. The state of data analysis, however, has changed. Now we are testing millions of hypotheses at once, for example in genome-wide association studies, and making a false discovery is not the end of the world. Moreover, FWER is so stringent a method that individual departures from the null in this setting have little chance of being detected; FWER control often returns nothing. While we do not want to waste time on too many null genes, we need a compromise: the burden of proof for FWER is too high. We prefer to return some false positives along with many potentially interesting genes, because this enables scientists to follow these leads and to distinguish the important genes from the false discoveries. A new point of view advanced by Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) proposes controlling the expected proportion of errors among the rejected hypotheses.",2017,,"list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

Representing multiple key genomic pathways, these mRNAs are significantly associated with cR and PCSS after RP, providing prognostic information beyond PSA, cT stage and Gleason Score. We evaluated microRNA expression in the same specimens for association with cR and PCSS.


METHODS
All cT1/cT2 prostate cancer pts treated with RP at Cleveland Clinic from 1987-2004 were identified (n~2,600), of which 127 pts w/ cR and 374 pts w/o cR after RP were randomly selected using cohort sampling. RNA was purified from 2 macrodissected FPE tumor specimens per pt. Expression of 76 test and 5 reference microRNAs was quantified by RT-PCR. Cox regression and control of the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to assess reference-normalized microRNA and mRNA expression for association with cR and PCSS.


RESULTS
106 pts with cR and 310 without cR had sufficient RNA and successful microRNA assays. Analysis of primary Gleason pattern tumor tissue for each pt identified 21 microRNAs associated with cR and 13 microRNAs associated with PCSS, with FDR at 10%; 8 microRNAs were associated with both endpoints. Similar analysis of highest Gleason pattern tumor tissue for each pt identified 22 microRNAs associated with cR (17 overlapping with those for the primary Gleason pattern) and 7 microRNAs associated with PCSS, with FDR at 10%; 4 were associated with both endpoints. miR-1, miR-21, miR-93, and miR-106b were associated with both cR and PCSS in primary and highest Gleason pattern specimens. The 76 microRNAs in this study tended to have weaker association with cR and PCSS than the 732 mRNAs. In multivariate analyses, mRNAs and microRNAs provided prognostic information beyond PSA, cT stage, and biopsy Gleason score. MicroRNAs co-express more frequently with each other than with mRNAs, which may indicate distinct biological regulation.


CONCLUSIONS
Expression of some microRNAs assayed in FPE prostate tumor tissue was associated with cR and PCSS after RP in this study, and may retain prognostic value in the face of tumor heterogeneity.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric A.

b4f9eff65df723bcfb83c22b3ff9a449ab7ab2c2,Effect of infliximab on mRNA expression profiles in synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients,"We examined the gene expression profiles in arthroscopic biopsies retrieved from 10 rheumatoid arthritis patients before and after anti-TNF treatment with infliximab to investigate whether such profiles can be used to predict responses to the therapy, and to study effects of the therapy on the profiles. Responses to treatment were assessed using European League Against Rheumatism response criteria. Three patients were found to be good responders, five patients to be moderate responders and two patients to be nonresponders. The TNF-Î± status of the biopsies from each of the patients before treatment was also investigated immunohistochemically, and it was detected in biopsies from four of the patients, including all three of the good responders. The gene expression data demonstrate that all patients had unique gene expression signatures, with low intrapatient variability between biopsies. The data also revealed significant differences between the good responding and nonresponding patients (279 differentially expressed genes were detected, with a false discovery rate < 0.025). Among the identified genes we found that MMP-3 was significantly upregulated in good responders (log2 fold change, 2.95) compared with nonresponders, providing further support for the potential of MMP-3 as a marker for good responses to therapy. An even more extensive list of 685 significantly differentially expressed genes was found between patients in whom TNF-Î± was found and nonresponders, indicating that TNF-Î± could be an important biomarker for successful infliximab treatment. Significant differences were also observed between biopsies taken before and after anti-TNF treatment, including 115 differentially expressed genes in the good responding group. Interestingly, the effect was even stronger in the group in which TNF-Î± was immunohistochemically detected before therapy. Here, 1,058 genes were differentially expressed, including many that were novel in this context (for example, CXCL3 and CXCL14). Subsequent Gene Ontology analysis revealed that several 'themes' were significantly over-represented that are known to be affected by anti-TNF treatment in inflammatory tissue; for example, immune response (GO:0006955), cell communication (GO:0007154), signal transduction (GO:0007165) and chemotaxis (GO:0006935). No genes reached statistical significance in the moderately responding or nonresponding groups. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that further investigation is warranted on the usefulness of gene expression profiling of synovial tissue to predict and monitor the outcome of rheumatoid arthritis therapies.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Johan Lindberg"", ids = ""145758105""); list(name = ""Erik af Klint"", ids = ""5655125""); list(name = ""Anca Irinel Catrina"", ids = ""3749921""); list(name = ""Peter Nilsson"", ids = ""48586383""); list(name = ""Lars Klareskog"", ids = ""153728702""); list(name = ""Ann-Kristin Ulfgren"", ids = ""4383435""); list(name = ""Joakim Lundeberg"", ids = ""2217647"")",e6895eb4324fcd84724d4407a677e2363e224e44; 7f0fcda563e6cbd06828e1d6f1850a7be6e1419e; c2e898a76d54acb86ef6977a78db8e52d94b437f; 6b2cefa1bbaf39a6d752a2ae1de8cd173e5ffd7d; c8e590e8272a4d4e5da5be72c34b2fcd196819c0; 5e1bf3f3fee13424ec13d4610b728594f0456251; 2ec31a4743b2b97ffa0ed8193d80100a7445999b; 4476019e6419f0b72912488e03ef8d52e0e7aacb; c599406494511674217964ff74b8e41b168cfc9e; 00e62435d4892913b4c49fb3a8fce8ea661cf3d8; cefc85e5fe0840befd9b69efad69fcdd7f0d2144; ecb6af640797d580ef4f6d629a178dc5590c8037; 4e950d6d1544d3c745fb2e5cf107bde74a4c1386; ebe291b44f6763ff19043de177f9240b7d18376d; c70569bbaa0caeed0eec5801f537e77822212345; 7bf30d3ee79733842b628c18e698a7fd8b2b1721; ddef80477f5c1d6f88edb576063c91b608520ff7; ee897b2d5607b4923c4561effb3a57c71e886349; 0da6ec347d52c952d072969c4d4ef17f70789b77; 6e173541e55f14ddcea7f3111ad2342652608cfc; 279b52bd78e39ac59111e25fb4a77bd0269b2596; be05cb24177d4d8ae95380a75a0a358aa7f8d28f; 5bcbad5057d61df1b9fab61898a63851638c2bfa; adc79a3a07f40f8e0d5760eebe1b8b7df09e9b0b; 4e650e115f27bee5a40d775b7be79ccced4c646b; 038b0417dde8eac717c091eec7b2f0a4251c4680; e64347c13203ba2083da94218fb285776c04bc60; 81e91c48412a9c8571cd9caf98211cfa7dc8ce9f; 6069d060d1c8670e7e1541f79f2b5a1f1fd2b204; fc48d520ffc01fddc6892977bd4817e9caf7bb20; b2c6454bf13946961dc5067074cf01eef743fb98; e5c726dad71844717438896cfe979946a77f131c; 2f83da0bf69cd75add84694e6ea2f9bf808f6a60; fdd31d06fc59e05351ccd3978b8a077b8891837a; c465478953775813925faabafd6f1a82bd6da36b; 6aa40dddffb2c69a9d61802bd7c65cc9de72cb75; 389b27fc2df30dd72383db7684add8db4cd1aaf7; 8e9e8b85d84318fbfec3f41b39e3332ff90e9eaf; 26c577fb06a7a03532e07a43879c781afa49afc4; c2c71461ff61fe87153a5e484a8f4e755d5e65cd; 66d0dc5d3ef50c848bbbce9079fa8251a1fbd837; b5a9829d51e660801fc2c3fa25a0ac65a1e84e19; 389d58f14e48c980989a0d0946233bd4c2b0f706; 003018995affe58767fb449773f66f0e59d83110; a2d64fcad73ce67506dd12e39750b2b7089c59b6,6e7737799afb7f418b4aff02c5b4087bb639e6a1; c79b9cbf45efe447b7e811c071c29a4c3185d612; fab4d05776b9d58f9d22d8ceda0f1c6d090b6d1a; f8f0d70f8532c408b272299271665973b85c13d4; 595ba667cddb9adde025ba6435ee34e33697aed5; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; df9aa247a9462c5d40fc1394b6fb0e7b50134787; 6623f0af412667617e40792d9c7375293d840cff; 116fed4779c786c01b875cea7941a02380e63651; fe4011ff017078cf98a1eecc2b491ac3cfa1ee39; a8b62d4a865d21dca28d66c2ac4a7b7958be1e15; 5bfc12d425122139d499a91954c0c6a8ef4e2c8f; 7bf03b8c7ce8e2c40c698bb0ce69e5e2404b3adc; 50c1317ca6e42e2ca5a52e704a5652ad48ac3063; d081961dc86887a379d98cc1e19f7edb1917ac13; 68df6bc7879fb6d941ff1b40714aedee2471aa48; 2fc99ad15eafd2f459938f5e4494bd02932d7495; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 465837e76c952e28d373ddf8d086c7a88010fc75; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 5c0394a8130f4d686b4a578e5fcd895fabde498a; f0ee80c5cbe1d93ea7cf06da57d6ceb39bd51540; 58483decc74b07ea98a5b9823046d5a3d2317476; e8d030f0e85b4e011e29e0a8eea5fefae7ac3925; ea160184ca6fcf4d60244b73971f8a9468ca9711; 532dddebb64345197ecf4f12e7828a6dd2089252; a1d63f6934b2067ba4b929198f890297a47edfd2; 2ab5b96916ebbe33c78c2fc29afe7bc4f2791085; 71d3c13e7628ace22bbe0e6cd4ce5d2bb9104228; 938b33bdfb2aa673f16ef2d6e5944fd458604514; 7e6ec081f025f9bdf22f191859031629290dca84; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; f15a5a70bb2387a88d770cf590f2a4467995ed61; 5721e6b1b047875031eee65a44346f744fd4c919; b802b297e40848652e9d3bf80b34d24fea1698bb; f540662a6cc5e19ad544367b92e3af9aa3ec882a; 27fa64eb32986c21fd3cef2d40ad050be9454369; 00e9300dd3a2f97e2b143237e4ff2eea460435a2; 4d01d429f6a01e51e85057e8ee412b6dfcd0e09f; 80193baf1603dfda4be863020279468a86e5cb49; 73c8ebd1120471d7095b2c50eefd1ea1e46c772e; 512647de8c0deb46cf1f9b435309513f26efaf4e; 71848884359d6ce8cd9fa0daf6f904e9abf11ecf; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; 8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92; 60368d37ae1e4c5f1a73da8a5e6ccfd96fdec716; a898887ab4f5500647359d4ba0aed532da26aee5; 90fdaa2b2c3fe4718105462b16687707167d37e2; 03be8d5e143d6cf3342abf48cb7d5664e629cae8; 6104b2bd167848aad9efabf26cc71b01d5f9866e; a87e4b5fd8daec3e376f26b1c744bb60e06f3c75; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 72d8e9a1de1224e5896241b1ae488f0712cc3869,Arthritis Research & Therapy,8,R179 - R179
19e37e7bbd83e8d87fc583afec1bb32de09136b9,Transcriptomics Comparison between Porcine Adipose and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells during In Vitro Osteogenic and Adipogenic Differentiation,"Bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) are considered the gold standard for use in tissue regeneration among mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). The abundance and ease of harvest make the adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) an attractive alternative to BMSC. The aim of the present study was to compare the transcriptome of ASC and BMSC, respectively isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue and femur of 3 adult pigs, during in vitro osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation for up to four weeks. At 0, 2, 7, and 21 days of differentiation RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. A False Discovery Rate â‰¤0.05 for overall interactions effect and P<0.001 between comparisons were used to determine differentially expressed genes (DEG). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and DAVID performed the functional analysis of the DEG. Functional analysis of highest expressed genes in MSC and genes more expressed in MSC vs. fully differentiated tissues indicated low immunity and high angiogenic capacity. Only 64 genes were differentially expressed between ASC and BMSC before differentiation. The functional analysis uncovered a potential larger angiogenic, osteogenic, migration, and neurogenic capacity in BMSC and myogenic capacity in ASC. Less than 200 DEG were uncovered between ASC and BMSC during differentiation. Functional analysis also revealed an overall greater lipid metabolism in ASC, while BMSC had a greater cell growth and proliferation. The time course transcriptomic comparison between differentiation types uncovered <500 DEG necessary to determine cell fate. The functional analysis indicated that osteogenesis had a larger cell proliferation and cytoskeleton organization with a crucial role of G-proteins. Adipogenesis was driven by PPAR signaling and had greater angiogenesis, lipid metabolism, migration, and tumorigenesis capacity. Overall the data indicated that the transcriptome of the two MSC is relatively similar across the conditions studied. In addition, functional analysis data might indicate differences in therapeutic application.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Elisa Monaco"", ids = ""152152955""); list(name = ""Massimo Bionaz"", ids = ""50559748""); list(name = ""Sandra Rodriguez-Zas"", ids = ""1422138675""); list(name = ""W L Hurley"", ids = ""2098826""); list(name = ""Matthew B.

2cf65a23a526f2665171c5f07d31816eb8abd7ba,"Xenobiotic-metabolizing gene variants, pesticide use, and the risk of prostate cancer.","BACKGROUND
To explore associations with prostate cancer and farming, it is important to investigate the relationship between pesticide use and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in xenobiotic metabolic enzyme (XME) genes.


OBJECTIVE
[corrected] We evaluated pesticide-SNP interactions between 45 pesticides and 1913 XME SNPs with respect to prostrate cancer among 776 cases and 1444 controls in the Agricultural Health Study.


METHODS
We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiplicative SNP-pesticide interactions were calculated using a likelihood ratio test.


RESULTS
A positive monotonic interaction was observed between petroleum oil/petroleum distillate use and rs1883633 in the oxidative stress gene glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC; P interaction=1.0Ã—10(-4)); men carrying at least one variant allele (minor allele) experienced an increased prostate cancer risk (OR=3.7, 95% CI: 1.9-7.3). Among men carrying the variant allele for thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2) rs4485648, microsomal epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) rs17309872, or myeloperoxidase (MPO) rs11079344, an increased prostate cancer risk was observed with high, compared with no, petroleum oil/petroleum distillate (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2, P interaction=0.01; OR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.0, P interaction=0.01), or terbufos (OR=3.0, 95% CI: 1.5-6.0, P interaction=2.0Ã—10(-3)) use, respectively. No interactions were deemed noteworthy at the false discovery rate=0.20 level; the number of observed interactions in XMEs was comparable with the number expected by chance alone.


CONCLUSION
We observed several pesticide-SNP interactions in oxidative stress and phase I/II enzyme genes and risk of prostate cancer. Additional work is needed to explain the joint contribution of genetic variation in XMEs, pesticide use, and prostate cancer risk.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Stella Koutros"", ids = ""3662087""); list(name = ""Gabriella Andreotti"", ids = ""3003370""); list(name = ""Sonja I.

509237fa114fe669c7fd04ee359c0ae723467113,CTLA4/ICOS gene variants and haplotypes are associated with rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis in the Canadian population.,"OBJECTIVE
The co-occurrence of different autoimmune diseases in patients and their families suggests the presence of shared genetic risk factors. Two compelling candidate autoimmune disease susceptibility genes are those that encode CTLA4 and inducible costimulator (ICOS), immunoregulatory proteins. Associations of CTLA4 polymorphisms with various autoimmune diseases have been reported, but for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), the association data are inconsistent and have largely excluded analysis of polymorphisms in the ICOS gene adjacent to CTLA4. We undertook this study to examine whether CTLA4 and ICOS influence RA and PBC susceptibility by testing CTLA4/ICOS polymorphisms for association with these diseases in Canadian subjects.


METHODS
Caucasian RA patients (n = 1,140), PBC patients (n = 481), and controls (n = 1,248) were typed for 21 biallelic polymorphisms across the CTLA4/ ICOS genes using a multiplex genotyping array, and the results were analyzed using a false discovery rate method to correct for multiple testing.


RESULTS
Significant associations of multiple CTLA4 and ICOS gene polymorphisms with RA and PBC were observed, with the strongest association signals for both diseases coming from a CTLA4/ICOS intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs17268364 (corrected P [P(corr)] = 6.0 x 10(-4) and P(corr) < 1.0 x 10(-4), respectively). Significant associations, which were common to both diseases, were also observed with other alleles and haplotypes across 3 linkage disequilibrium blocks within the CTLA4 gene, the intergenic region, and the ICOS gene.


CONCLUSION
Our results provide evidence for RA and PBC association with the CTLA4/ICOS locus and suggest that the risk allele(s) within this region may be common to both diseases.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Erin J.

9f330551040dc806023cf15183f318e79e8ffecb,Differentially Expressed Gene Transcripts Using RNA Sequencing from the Blood of Immunosuppressed Kidney Allograft Recipients,"We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to identify differentially expressed gene transcripts (DEGs) after kidney transplantation and after the start of immunosuppressive drugs. RNAseq is superior to microarray to determine DEGs because it's not limited to available probes, has increased sensitivity, and detects alternative and previously unknown transcripts. DEGs were determined in 32 adult kidney recipients, without clinical acute rejection (AR), treated with antibody induction, calcineurin inhibitor, mycophenolate, with and without steroids. Blood was obtained pre-transplant (baseline), week 1, months 3 and 6 post-transplant. PBMCs were isolated, RNA extracted and gene expression measured using RNAseq. Principal components (PCs) were computed using a surrogate variable approach. DEGs post-transplant were identified by controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at < 0.01 with at least a 2 fold change in expression from pre-transplant. The top 5 DEGs with higher levels of transcripts in blood at week 1 were TOMM40L, TMEM205, OLFM4, MMP8, and OSBPL9 compared to baseline. The top 5 DEGs with lower levels at week 1 post-transplant were IL7R, KLRC3, CD3E, CD3D, and KLRC2 (Striking Image) compared to baseline. The top pathways from genes with lower levels at 1 week post-transplant compared to baseline, were T cell receptor signaling and iCOS-iCOSL signaling while the top pathways from genes with higher levels than baseline were axonal guidance signaling and LXR/RXR activation. Gene expression signatures at month 3 were similar to week 1. DEGs at 6 months post-transplant create a different gene signature than week 1 or month 3 post-transplant. RNAseq analysis identified more DEGs with lower than higher levels in blood compared to baseline at week 1 and month 3. The number of DEGs decreased with time post-transplant. Further investigations to determine the specific lymphocyte(s) responsible for differential gene expression may be important in selecting and personalizing immune suppressant drugs and may lead to targeted therapies.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Casey R.

We investigated the acute genomic response of quadriceps muscle to a single bout of PES or RE in stable COPD patients. Method: 26 COPD patients [15 male; mean(SD) FEV 1 % pred, 42.9(17.9)%; age, 63.9(7.9) yrs; fat free mass index, 16.6(1.8)kg/m 2 ] underwent 30min of quadriceps PES (50Hz, 300Î¼s pulse duration, 15s/5s duty cycle) or 5x30 maximal isokinetic knee extensions at 180Â°/s. Resting vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were performed immediately before and 24hr after PES or RE. Microfluidic low density microarray cards were used to assess the expression of 384 targeted transcripts by RT-PCR. Significant change in expression from baseline was determined using the Î”Î”C T method with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of Results: PES and RE altered mRNA abundance of 18 and 68 genes respectively (FDR<5%), of which 14 were common to both contraction modalities and of the same magnitude of fold change (Fig 1). Biological functions of up-regulated genes included inflammation, hypertrophy, muscle protein turnover and muscle growth, whilst down-regulated genes included mitochondrial and cell signalling transcripts.
 Conclusion: Voluntary RE produces more profound acute changes in muscle mRNA abundance than PES, but there is a commonality of response around genes associated with muscle anabolism.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lorna E.

Methods: DNA sequence coverage data are normalized within each sample and subsequently exonic CNVs are identified in a batch of samples (midpool), when the target log2 ratio of the sample to the batch median exceeds defined thresholds. The quality of exonic CNV calls is assessed by C-scores (Z-like scores) using thresholds derived from gold standard samples and simulation studies. We integrate an ExonQC threshold to lower FDR and compare performance with alternate software (VisCap). Results: Thirteen CNVs were used as a truth set to validate Atlas-CNV and compared with VisCap. We demonstrated FDR reduction in validation, simulation and 10,926 eMERGESeq samples without sensitivity loss. Sixty-four multi-exon and 29 single-exon CNVs with high C-scores were assessed by MLPA. Conclusions: Atlas-CNV is validated as a method to identify exonic CNVs in targeted sequencing data generated in the clinical laboratory. The ExonQC and C-score assignment can reduce FDR (identification of targets with high variance) and improve calling accuracy of single-exon CNVs respectively.

We have previously shown that late-gestation diabetes, especially in conjunction with a maternal high-fat (HF) diet, impairs cardiac functions in rat-offspring. This study investigated changes in genome-wide histone modifications in newborn hearts from rat-pups exposed to maternal diabetes and HF-diet. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed a differential peak distribution on gene promoters in exposed pups with respect to acetylation of lysines 9 and 14 and to trimethylation of lysines 4 and 27 in histone H3 (all, false discovery rate, FDR < 0.1). In the HF-diet exposed offspring, 54% of the annotated genes showed the gene-activating mark trimethylated lysine 4. Many of these genes (1) are associated with the ""metabolic process"" in general and particularly with ""positive regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis"" (FDR = 0.03); (2) overlap with 455 quantitative trait loci for blood pressure, body weight, serum cholesterol (all, FDR < 0.1); and (3) are linked to cardiac disease susceptibility/progression, based on disease ontology analyses and scientific literature. These results indicate that maternal HF-diet changes the cardiac histone signature in offspring suggesting a fuel-mediated epigenetic reprogramming of cardiac tissue in utero.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bijaya Upadhyaya"", ids = ""48240772""); list(name = ""Tricia D.

f5f62ebb12e921a6542a813ea8922fa663c7ec13,Long-Chain Fatty Acid Combustion Rate Is Associated with Unique Metabolite Profiles in Skeletal Muscle Mitochondria,"BACKGROUND/AIM
Incomplete or limited long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) combustion in skeletal muscle has been associated with insulin resistance. Signals that are responsive to shifts in LCFA beta-oxidation rate or degree of intramitochondrial catabolism are hypothesized to regulate second messenger systems downstream of the insulin receptor. Recent evidence supports a causal link between mitochondrial LCFA combustion in skeletal muscle and insulin resistance. We have used unbiased metabolite profiling of mouse muscle mitochondria with the aim of identifying candidate metabolites within or effluxed from mitochondria and that are shifted with LCFA combustion rate.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Large-scale unbiased metabolomics analysis was performed using GC/TOF-MS on buffer and mitochondrial matrix fractions obtained prior to and after 20 min of palmitate catabolism (n = 7 mice/condition). Three palmitate concentrations (2, 9 and 19 microM; corresponding to low, intermediate and high oxidation rates) and 9 microM palmitate plus tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain inhibitors were each tested and compared to zero palmitate control incubations. Paired comparisons of the 0 and 20 min samples were made by Student's t-test. False discovery rate were estimated and Type I error rates assigned. Major metabolite groups were organic acids, amines and amino acids, free fatty acids and sugar phosphates. Palmitate oxidation was associated with unique profiles of metabolites, a subset of which correlated to palmitate oxidation rate. In particular, palmitate oxidation rate was associated with distinct changes in the levels of TCA cycle intermediates within and effluxed from mitochondria.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
This proof-of-principle study establishes that large-scale metabolomics methods can be applied to organelle-level models to discover metabolite patterns reflective of LCFA combustion, which may lead to identification of molecules linking muscle fat metabolism and insulin signaling. Our results suggest that future studies should focus on the fate of effluxed TCA cycle intermediates and on mechanisms ensuring their replenishment during LCFA metabolism in skeletal muscle.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Erin L Seifert"", ids = ""5340437""); list(name = ""Oliver Fiehn"", ids = ""1763019""); list(name = ""VÃ©ronic BÃ©zaire"", ids = ""4070321""); list(name = ""David R.

92dc26a71b385a276538471f65d69f760a82b7b2,Inference on the Limiting False Discovery Rate and the P-value Threshold Parameter Assuming Weak Dependence between Gene Expression Levels within Subject,"An objective of microarray data analysis is to identify gene expressions that are associated with a disease related outcome. For each gene, a test statistic is computed to determine if an association exists, and this statistic generates a marginal p-value. In an effort to pool this information across genes, a p-value density function is derived. The p-value density is modeled as a mixture of a uniform (0,1) density and a scaled ratio of normal densities derived from the asymptotic normality of the test statistic. The p-values are assumed to be weakly dependent and a quasi-likelihood is used to estimate the parameters in the mixture density. The quasi-likelihood and the weak dependence assumption enables estimation and asymptotic inference on the false discovery rate for a given rejection region, and its inverse, the p-value threshold parameter for a fixed false discovery rate. A false discovery rate analysis on a localized prostate cancer data set is used to illustrate the methodology.

Studies on the energy-GDP nexus for Latin America have been few and bounded to short periods. We fill this gap by searching for causal paths between energy and GDP for 20 Latin American countries using a newly compiled dataset spanning the twentieth century. Our main identification strategy is based on super exogeneity, which we complement with Granger tests, Toda and Yamamoto and enrich by controlling for structural breaks and the False Discovery Rate. The results highlight the inexistence of a homogeneous relation between energy and GDP in highly heterogeneous spatial and temporal dimensions, and thus the need to enhance our theoretical understanding of this relation. The policy implication is that designing and implementing energy policies coming from a single methodological approach and based on aggregated results should be avoided.",2020,Economics,"list(name = ""Benjamin Leiva"", ids = ""50662850""); list(name = ""M. d.

f95662e8f70e40fcf47f06bb32d3e395013fead8,Gene Expression Profiling Reveals a Crucial Role for C/EBPbeta in Proliferation Pathways of ALK+ ALCL Cell Lines,"Introduction: ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) overexpress C/EBPÎ², as a consequence of NPM-ALK kinase activity. C/EBPÎ² is a leucine zipper transcription factor, which plays a major role in cellular differentiation, inflammation, proliferation and metabolism control. To determine the role of C/EBPÎ² in ALK+ ALCL transformation, and to identify its downstream targets, a highly specific C/EBPÎ²-shRNA was used to knockdown C/EBPÎ². The consequences of C/EBPÎ² gene-silencing were analyzed by gene expression profiling. Materials and Methods: Four ALK+ ALCL cell lines, SUDHL-1, Kijk, Karpas 299 and SUP-M2 were transfected with lentivirus containing the C/EBPÎ² shRNA or the vector without shRNA in triplicates. Western Blot analysis and qRT-PCR were performed to quantify the knockdown effect. At day three after infection, RNA was extracted and used for Gene Chip expression analysis (Affymetrix). Using Anova software for statistical analysis, we identified genes, which were regulated in all four cell lines. The effect of C/EBPÎ² knockdown on proliferation, cell cycle, and viability was analyzed by MTT assay and FACS analysis. Results: In all four ALK+ ALCL, efficient C/EBPÎ² knockdown resulted in profound growth retardation (up to 84%) compared to control cells after 6 days of infection, and a clear shift from the S phase to the G1 phase in the cell cycle was observed. To identify genes regulated by C/EBPÎ² in all four cell lines, we performed statistical analysis applying a false discovery rate of 20%, and accepted only genes with a >1,1 and Conclusions: C/EBPÎ² silencing induces growth arrest in ALK+ALCL, which correlates with differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation. This study reveals C/EBPÎ² as a master transcription regulator of NPM-ALK induced cellular proliferation, and therefore, an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutic intervention.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Irina Bonzheim"", ids = ""5656090""); list(name = ""Martin Irmler"", ids = ""50158412""); list(name = ""NataÅ¡a Anastasov"", ids = ""4681958""); list(name = ""Margit Klier"", ids = ""39692554""); list(name = ""Johannes Beckers"", ids = ""145199432""); list(name = ""Stefania Pittaluga"", ids = ""4156250""); list(name = ""Falko Fend"", ids = ""49803632""); list(name = ""Mark A.

0790e1cf936bcaba80a3d91b345a548333e4a375,Coordinate based random effect size meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies,"Abstract Low power in neuroimaging studies can make them difficult to interpret, and Coordinate based metaâ€analysis (CBMA) may go some way to mitigating this issue. CBMA has been used in many analyses to detect where published functional MRI or voxelâ€based morphometry studies testing similar hypotheses report significant summary results (coordinates) consistently. Only the reported coordinates and possibly t statistics are analysed, and statistical significance of clusters is determined by coordinate density. Here a method of performing coordinate based random effect size metaâ€analysis and metaâ€regression is introduced. The algorithm (ClusterZ) analyses both coordinates and reported t statistic or Z score, standardised by the number of subjects. Statistical significance is determined not by coordinate density, but by a random effects metaâ€analyses of reported effects performed clusterâ€wise using standard statistical methods and taking account of censoring inherent in the published summary results. Type 1 error control is achieved using the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR), which is based on the false discovery rate. This controls both the family wise error rate under the null hypothesis that coordinates are randomly drawn from a standard stereotaxic space, and the proportion of significant clusters that are expected under the null. Such control is necessary to avoid propagating and even amplifying the very issues motivating the metaâ€analysis in the first place. ClusterZ is demonstrated on both numerically simulated data and on real data from reports of grey matter loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) and syndromes suggestive of MS, and of painful stimulus in healthy controls. The software implementation is available to download and use freely.

52ec3f48edbbc81ad025010ffdf3d9701865d568,Evaluation of seeds ethanolic extracts of Triplaris gardneriana Wedd. using in vitro and in vivo toxicological methods.,"Triplaris gardneriana Wedd. is a tree used in folk medicine to treat venereal diseases and inflammation as well as a source of biological compounds with antioxidant capacity. In order to assess the safety of these bioactive compounds, the present study aimed to determine the toxicity of an ethanolic extract of T. gardneriana, (EETg). Toxicological tests included hemolytic activity, toxicity toward the brine shrimp Artemia, cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MCF7) and acute oral toxicity in rodents. In addition, toxicogenomics techniques were used to determine genome expression in MCF7 cells exposed to EETg. The results showed that the extract exhibits approximately 60% of hemolytic activity at the highest tested concentration (64Â Âµg/ml) and toxicity against nauplii of Artemia sp. (LC50 of 67.85Â Âµg/ml). Further, EETg appears to be cytotoxic to MCF7 (cell viability reduced to 40% at 250Â Âµg/ml after 24Â hr). Genomic data demonstrated differential expression of 14 genes. Data analysis indicated possible altered pathways (e.g., xenobiotic metabolism), possible adverse health risks (e.g., hepatotoxicity), and drugs with similar gene expression profile (e.g., antimicrobials). The investigation provides important information on potentially adverse aspects of EETg, which need to be considered prior to the therapeutic utilization of this plant.Abbreviations: EETg: ethanolic extract of T. gardneriana seeds; MCF7: michigan cancer foundation-7 which refers to a human breast cell line (adenocarcinoma); NGS: next-generation sequencing; edgeR: empirical analysis of digital gene expression data in R; Consensus: consensus path database; FDR: false discovery rate; NCBI: national center for biotechnology information; KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes; Ingenuity: ingenuity pathway analysis software; CMAP: connectivity map; OECD: organization for economic co-operation and development; HL-60: human promyelocytic leukemia cells; PC3: prostate cancer cells.",2020,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thiago Silva de Almeida"", ids = ""145502804""); list(name = ""Mariana R.

c70d1123b8d398481f124950784506fc96f8549c,A Framework for Controlling False Discovery Rates and Minimizing the Amount of Genotyping in the Search for Disease Mutations,"Objectives: To develop a method for designing studies to find disease mutations that can achieve a set of goals with respect to proportions of false and true discoveries with the minimum amount of genotyping. Methods: Derivation of an analytical framework supplemented with simulation techniques. The approach is illustrated for a fine mapping study and a whole-genome linkage disequilibrium scan. Results: The use of multiple stages where earlier stages are characterized by very high false discovery rates (FDR) followed by an abrupt change to the required FDR in the final stage results in a 50â€“75% reduction in genotyping. The proportion of true discoveries is a much more important determinant of the genotyping burden than the FDR. Neither sample size nor controlling the false discoveries will present major problems in whole-genome LD scans but the amount of genotyping will be extremely large even if the study is completely designed to minimize genotyping. Conclusions: The proposed statistical framework presents a simple and flexible approach to determine the design parameters (e.g. sample size, p values at which tests need to be performed at each stage) that minimize the genotyping burden given a set of goals for the percentage of true and false discoveries.",2003,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Edwin J.C.G. van den Oord"", ids = ""48799852""); list(name = ""Patrick F.

c3d360926e8aaa18c4308386c81f7917881eb0af,Transcriptional modulation in a leukocyte-depleted splenic cell population during prion disease.,"Prion replication in the periphery precedes neuroinvasion in many experimental rodent scrapie models, and in natural sheep scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Prions propagate in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs and are strongly associated with follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and possibly circulating dendritic cells and macrophages. Given the importance of lymphoid organs in prion disease transmission and pathogenesis, gene expression studies may reveal host factors or biological pathways related to prion replication and accumulation. A procedure was developed to enrich for FDC, dendritic cells, and macrophages prior to the investigation of transcriptional alterations in murine splenic cells during prion pathogenesis. In total, 1753 transcripts exhibited fold changes greater than three (false discovery rates less than 2%) in this population isolated from spleens of prion-infected versus uninfected mice. The gene for the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin (DCN) was one of the genes most overexpressed in infected mice, and the splenic protein levels mirrored this in mice infected with scrapie as well as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). A number of groups of functionally related genes were also significantly decreased in infected spleens. These included genes related to iron metabolism and homeostasis, pathways that have also been implicated in prion pathogenesis in the brain. These gene expression alterations provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying prion disease pathogenesis and may serve as a pool of potential surrogate markers for the early detection and diagnosis of some prion diseases.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rhiannon L.

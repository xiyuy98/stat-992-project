d6dd6b621e86c42a090f36d4dffe715abab21b4a,TIA Biomarkers Determined Through Proteomics (I11-1A),"Background: One of the â€œholy grailsâ€ in vascular neurology is a TIA serum marker. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a unique, unbiased method to identify candidate proteins, was used to test the serum of patients with transient neurologic symptoms for biomarkers of cerebral ischemia.
Methods: Patients with transient neurologic symptoms were prospectively enrolled. Mass spectrometry was performed on the serum samples, and results were searched against the Human Uniport database. Three candidate proteins were found, and serum concentrations of these proteins were measured by ELISA in a second cohort of prospectively enrolled patients. The studentâ€™s t-test was used for comparison. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure for multiple comparison adjustments determined significance for the proteomic screen.
Results: Patients with TIA (n=20), minor stroke (n=15), and controls (i.e. migraine, seizure, n=12) were enrolled in the first cohort. Ceruloplasmin, complement component C8 gamma (C8Î³) and platelet basic protein (PBP) were significantly different between the ischemic samples (TIA and minor stroke) and the controls (p = 0.0001, p=0.00027, p=0.00105 respectively). A second cohort of patients with TIA (n=21), minor stroke (n=20), and controlsâ€™ (n=12) serum was tested. PBP serum concentrations were increased in the ischemic samples compared to control (for TIA and stroke, p= 0.046, for TIA alone, p=0.019). Ceruloplasmin trended towards increased concentrations in the ischemic groups (p=0.127), and an insignificant increase in C8Î³ (p=0.44) was found.
Conclusions: PBP has been identified as potential serum biomarker for TIA. Larger sample size may find that ceruloplasmin is an additional candidate. Ultimately, a panel of proteins may be required. Larger studies are needed to determine the validity of these proteins in clinical use. Disclosure: Dr. George has nothing to disclose. Dr. Mlynash has nothing to disclose.

(Pst) remains one of the most significant diseases of wheat worldwide. We investigated stripe rust resistance by genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) in 959 spring wheat accessions from the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service National Small Grains Collection, representing major global production environments. The panel was characterized for field resistance in multi-environment field trials and seedling resistance under greenhouse conditions. A genome-wide set of 5,619 informative SNP markers were used to examine the population structure, linkage disequilibrium and marker-trait associations in the germplasm panel. Based on model-based analysis of population structure and hierarchical Ward clustering algorithm, the accessions were clustered into two major subgroups. These subgroups were largely separated according to geographic origin and improvement status of the accessions. A significant correlation was observed between the population sub-clusters and response to stripe rust infection. We identified 11 and 7 genomic regions with significant associations with stripe rust resistance at adult plant and seedling stages, respectively, based on a false discovery rate multiple correction method. The regions harboring all, except three, of the QTL identified from the field and greenhouse studies overlap with positions of previously reported QTL. Further work should aim at validating the identified QTL using proper germplasm and populations to enhance their utility in marker assisted breeding.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kebede T Muleta"", ids = ""15529389""); list(name = ""Peter Bulli"", ids = ""3534451""); list(name = ""Sheri Rynearson"", ids = ""8110033""); list(name = ""Xianming Chen"", ids = ""1767481""); list(name = ""Michael O.

1900e254a8923892e0bdd6a0315bb845ceb6bc3e,Martingale Methods for Control of False Discovery Rate and Expected Number of False Rejections,"[English]: In this dissertation we deal with multiple test procedures that control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and the Expected Number of False Rejections (ENFR) for independent as well as dependent test statistics. Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to multiple testing and related error rates. In Chapter 2 we restrict attention to several dependence structures. A new kind of dependence, namely the martingale dependence, is introduced. Among others, useful relationships between different dependence structures are provided. Chapter 3 is devoted to the Asymptotically Optimal Rejection Curve (AORC) introduced in Finner et al. [2009]. Based on the AORC, we propose some estimates for the FDR that lead to FDR- and ENFR-controlling step down (SD) test procedures. In Chapter 4 we show how the power of SD procedures can be improved in case the underlying p-values are positive regression dependent on a subset of true null hypotheses or positive orthant dependent. Motivated by the SD procedure in Benjamini and Liu [1999], we propose a new technique for the improvement of the power of SD procedures based on the increase of the smallest critical values. In Chapter 5 we focus on adaptive SD procedures based on the so-called Î²âˆ’adjusted AORC. Several new results on FDR- and ENFR-control under martingale dependence are provided. In the case of independent test statistics we prove FDR- and ENFR-control in an alternative way. Moreover, based on results in Chapter 4 we propose an improvement of the procedure introduced in Gavrilov et al. [2009] without loss of FDR-control. Chapter 6 is devoted to martingale dependent test statistics. We provide sufficient conditions for that kind of dependence. Various examples for martingale dependent statistics are presented. In Chapter 7 we consider the situation where null hypotheses and alternatives cannot be separated from each other - the case of uniformly distributed p-values under alternativies. Finally, in Chapter 8 we introduce a necessary condition for FDR-control of SD tests.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Julia Benditkis"", ids = ""89405459"")",854d7a2532fb59bebba38833f95825da42bfd17f; aa95eaffacddcc1cde626b25be7739346873a1f6; 85b3043be9fa0b7afe0e72694a23df8dfcbcb0a1,7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; df01b02f8e4e8051fcdd14fc048002de54993857; c5a0ff2ce6c6e8e78f79fe98481aaafc0bdda417; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 809b5a149fbbebbe608ea91e120ac99bcd9ce4d3; f4890345d1f0547606508185cf65d49613fbd423; e91ae2cef456516df3d9fc6997428500a1b8b5d3; 3037bb2686d93d67944078c4d8bfebc934bd60e3; 735cfe384afa5e090cb4cc70c1f56dd664ad6a64; 1884f4ceaf96dda8ca0a8f75f9a68d53b9090c6e; 7b84343528ff8aaf4123b460a3464e38b938aeca; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72; 0a211c36cf59d09bb44204458c5e3f7e999bfb92; 5a975f73e954f49a1321852ff9fd9999a0157da4; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 16b91b3444d6e971877f57e68b306f1de8b023ae; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 8d3440516d384702085548902006b8c6889ce2f5; b9a7ae898f33f2709227fc4beea68b96b0969dc5; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 73ed1515be8e2d5bef6d0545aaea6258553f9d44; 44ad82804c2acab9e305de3933a78c59108de02c; 4286db547a55ec49c57f5213c75937de240ebc95; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 1184457ca2855e201ec40b37f1bb82a8e874b758; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 0a34081265123f536e43febd3c57ba5c25dd334b; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; 0e2441103746d899fdb545d118771c711cda0dd7; 7af14752c65b4afdbc6d31f00c0129463739c189; 4c850f993f637e55275c902ae43cf6019592016a; f0e93985fdc9fb3e0104da508768bb4680a9d4e8; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; fc75ea1da867850ae0036c48afdfb1d70bf117dd; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; 8becaa4ddafe17458e0dd94fbd75d32a47d84d27; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; ff58be6eb96b560063ad9ab4d2bb22ca75bb5443; 384067f0fff24dcc19e8b33f78d4fb51813eb435; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; 49594776b8a1dce89e976c846266ccefafa948b7; 78d856a38f335f00f055e30bbd9f135e232e0add,,,
fe84c3143170761d017f10d2c3a5016b40ba0219,"Normalization , testing , and false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data","We discuss the identification of genes that are associated with an outcome in RNA sequencing and other sequence-based comparative genomic experiments. RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model. In summary, this work provides a pipeline for the significance analysis of sequencing data.",2012,,"list(name = ""Li Jun"", ids = ""50592163""); list(name = ""L.

4fe92971f38451114e471a5afaac74d20b1d6168,Proteome-wide identification of proteins and their modifications with decreased ambiguities and improved false discovery rates using unique sequence tags.,"Identifying proteins and their modification states and with known levels of confidence remains as a significant challenge for proteomics. Random or decoy peptide databases are increasingly being used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), e.g., from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses of tryptic digests. We show that this approach can significantly underestimate the FDR and describe an approach for more confident protein identifications that uses unique partial sequences derived from a combination of database searching and amino acid residue sequencing using high-accuracy MS/MS data. Applied to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tryptic digest, the approach provided 3 132 confident peptide identifications ( approximately 5% modified in some fashion), covering 575 proteins with an estimated zero FDR. The conventional approach provided 3 359 peptide identifications and 656 proteins with 0.3% FDR based upon a decoy database analysis. However, the present approach revealed approximately 5% of the 3 359 identifications to be incorrect and many more as potentially ambiguous (e.g., due to not considering certain amino acid substitutions and modifications). In addition, 677 peptides and 39 proteins were identified that had been missed by conventional analysis, including nontryptic peptides, peptides with a variety of expected/unexpected chemical modifications, known/unknown post-translational modifications, single nucleotide polymorphisms or gene encoding errors, and multiple modifications of individual peptides.",2008,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Yufeng Shen"", ids = ""37082667""); list(name = ""Nikola ToliÄ‡"", ids = ""2429166""); list(name = ""Kim K Hixson"", ids = ""5111455""); list(name = ""Samuel Owen Purvine"", ids = ""3036325""); list(name = ""Ljiljana PaÅ¡a-ToliÄ‡"", ids = ""1389266308""); list(name = ""Wei-jun Qian"", ids = ""153289382""); list(name = ""Joshua N.

5cf566d36c33b2f168636ce833d8a73ab7aeca12,Null-free False Discovery Rate Control Using Decoy Permutations for Multiple Testing,"The current approaches to false discovery rate (FDR) control in multiple hypothesis testing are usually based on the null distribution of a test statistic. However, all types of null distributions, including the theoretical, permutation-based and empirical ones, have some inherent drawbacks. For example, the theoretical null might fail because of improper assumptions on the sample distribution. Here, we propose a null distribution-free approach to FDR control for large-scale two-groups hypothesis testing. This approach, named $\textit{target-decoy procedure}$, simply builds on the ordering of tests by some statistic/score, the null distribution of which is not required to be known. Competitive decoy tests are constructed by permutations of original samples and are used to estimate the false target discoveries. We prove that this approach controls the FDR when the statistics are independent between different tests. Simulation demonstrates that it is more stable and powerful than two existing popular approaches. Evaluation is also made on a real dataset of gene expression microarray.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kun He"", ids = ""145905331""); list(name = ""Mengjie Li"", ids = ""50651409""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817032""); list(name = ""Fuzhou Gong"", ids = ""50654631""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Sun"", ids = ""145938660"")",,,arXiv: Methodology,,
76da286b85186fa862d5c72a5c11ee0664a81952,Beta Distribution-Based Cross-Entropy for Feature Selection,"Analysis of high-dimensional data is a challenge in machine learning and data mining. Feature selection plays an important role in dealing with high-dimensional data for improvement of predictive accuracy, as well as better interpretation of the data. Frequently used evaluation functions for feature selection include resampling methods such as cross-validation, which show an advantage in predictive accuracy. However, these conventional methods are not only computationally expensive, but also tend to be over-optimistic. We propose a novel cross-entropy which is based on beta distribution for feature selection. In beta distribution-based cross-entropy (BetaDCE) for feature selection, the probability density is estimated by beta distribution and the cross-entropy is computed by the expected value of beta distribution, so that the generalization ability can be estimated more precisely than conventional methods where the probability density is learnt from data. Analysis of the generalization ability of BetaDCE revealed that it was a trade-off between bias and variance. The robustness of BetaDCE was demonstrated by experiments on three types of data. In the exclusive or-like (XOR-like) dataset, the false discovery rate of BetaDCE was significantly smaller than that of other methods. For the leukemia dataset, the area under the curve (AUC) of BetaDCE on the test set was 0.93 with only four selected features, which indicated that BetaDCE not only detected the irrelevant and redundant features precisely, but also more accurately predicted the class labels with a smaller number of features than the original method, whose AUC was 0.83 with 50 features. In the metabonomic dataset, the overall AUC of prediction with features selected by BetaDCE was significantly larger than that by the original reported method. Therefore, BetaDCE can be used as a general and efficient framework for feature selection.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Weixing Dai"", ids = ""153126587""); list(name = ""Dianjing Guo"", ids = ""1895705"")",,,Entropy,21,769

Phosphopeptides were enriched from 0.5 mg of total peptides using a combined strategy of immobilized metal affinity and metal oxide affinity chromatography. Enriched phosphopeptides were analyzed by Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry and mass spectra mined against cognate genome or cDNA databases in both forward and randomized orientations, the latter to calculate false discovery rate. We identified a total of 2,001 phosphopeptides containing 1,026 unambiguous phosphorylation sites from 956 proteins, with an average false discovery rate of 0.78% for the entire study. The entire data set was uploaded into the Plant Protein Phosphorylation Database (www.p3db.org), including all meta-data and annotated spectra. The Plant Protein Phosphorylation Database is a portal for all plant phosphorylation data and allows for homology-based querying of experimentally determined phosphosites. Comparisons with other large-scale phosphoproteomic studies determined that 652 of the phosphoproteins are novel to this study. The unique proteins fall into several Gene Ontology categories, some of which are overrepresented in our study as well as other large-scale phosphoproteomic studies, including metabolic process and RNA binding; other categories are only overrepresented in our study, like embryonic development.

134be6bb940825682c54477eea1a1023d83c852b,Subsampling Winner Algorithm for Feature Selection in Large Regression Data,"Feature selection from a large number of covariates (aka features) in a regression analysis remains a challenge in data science, especially in terms of its potential of scaling to ever-enlarging data and finding a group of scientifically meaningful features. For example, to develop new, responsive drug targets for ovarian cancer, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) of a practical feature selection procedure must also match the target FDR. The popular approach to feature selection, when true features are sparse, is to use a penalized likelihood or a shrinkage estimation, such as a LASSO, SCAD, Elastic Net, or MCP procedure (call them benchmark procedures). We present a different approach using a new subsampling method, called the Subsampling Winner algorithm (SWA). The central idea of SWA is analogous to that used for the selection of US national merit scholars. SWA uses a ""base procedure"" to analyze each of the subsamples, computes the scores of all features according to the performance of each feature from all subsample analyses, obtains the ""semifinalist"" based on the resulting scores, and then determines the ""finalists,"" i.e., the most important features. Due to its subsampling nature, SWA can scale to data of any dimension in principle. The SWA also has the best-controlled actual FDR in comparison with the benchmark procedures and the randomForest, while having a competitive true-feature discovery rate. We also suggest practical add-on strategies to SWA with or without a penalized benchmark procedure to further assure the chance of ""true"" discovery. Our application of SWA to the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma specimens from the Broad Institute revealed functionally important genes and pathways, which we verified by additional genomics tools.

9b2caba521885d9c9c6e2b765d6f836b60564f17,Umbilical cord gene expression reveals the molecular architecture of the fetal inflammatory response in extremely preterm newborns,"Background:The fetal inflammatory response (FIR) in placental membranes to an intrauterine infection often precedes premature birth raising neonatal mortality and morbidity. However, the precise molecular events behind FIR still remain largely unknown, and little has been investigated at gene expression level.Methods:We collected publicly available microarray expression data profiling umbilical cord (UC) tissue derived from the cohort of extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs) and interrogate them for differentially expressed (DE) genes between FIR and nonâ€“FIR-affected ELGANs.Results:We found a broad and complex FIR UC gene expression signature, changing up to 19% (3,896/20,155) of all human genes at 1% false discovery rate. Significant changes of a minimum 50% magnitude (1,097/3,896) affect the upregulation of many inflammatory pathways and molecules, such as cytokines, toll-like receptors, and calgranulins. Remarkably, they also include the downregulation of neurodevelopmental pathways and genes, such as Fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1), contactin 1 (CNTN1), and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC).Conclusion:The FIR expression signature in UC tissue contains molecular clues about signaling pathways that trigger FIR, and it is consistent with an acute inflammatory response by fetal innate and adaptive immune systems, which participate in the pathogenesis of neonatal brain damage.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Costa"", ids = ""133822060""); list(name = ""Robert Castelo"", ids = ""3071080"")",34a5a6527c017861a189ebc16370f23fdab1e9ad,457065005c6c355d5ba80831afe4fa2d0e62f21d; dd7f5d788c71f9a820b5fe14512391f3b64babe4; 9711fea7e5c2405bb1ac2026577ed82c328ffa92; 7a39460cd4432282f1a251f90f14ff4cd16b8f3e; b775522a8c3de63ee31e1a30b3e5a4ed62fd31d6; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 8c93e9e9b0aa3e13ab20c5098ed2435c0833d120; 71a440b9fd802c0086bbdc909db64e361a830a5f; 13385cdae7c02326dea524bf58f4b00a4814562e; a2792d78d7bd427008232a007741d3347fdc2072; 7f7bbf8aabd13d237d9ed6ed61d62cb49c54c5de; d50a44a351b3aae92291c4201ff02b73ed6343b5; 4c036782a12c27730f7d8063d3d740dcb4a3d486; 902eb41fea8b88777141760f2ac6437fb006a376; 5cca50769a192dce9f569cfcf82352a872386a2a; 03c53eef1606cbc17871e4da0c63b82faa2b3214; 0e7f544818e09923176c52d87f321920c9274ae6; 2d0bc76140dae827c95a8a5a0a08d2ebef70be90; 997ae9143281981910a5efb239f545670351d72c; 8c27a604fc513c1f91d8faff01122728e7d84760; 880cd7f3ad3d4348394c3ed2ea32448bd8664f1a; 177d378e35a9d438488c1e4c4680884536c425c3; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 8c1eed72bb4c630e18c051b062dfab77e12eddb6; 1fdf002c438b2159e0112a75f9b5c19f48c219a1; ef74ffe56f297e3cddb0c471b7f4e7c4e6dbee49; 22732b9a0da758c3e1d3a2926f2efbc0cc847f22; 52125dd0e436a5fe3ced11587aa4f37a01c51a87; 678f4317c6fbf52add080a48c0ddcbd86865d087; ac0a4ab8dfa1c6e9729d9265fdb3925f9edf0a74; bd8c36d3635bf2af076434ea5d8f1ba623ac35bf; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 761b1f8f9325a9b594048b1bcfa082eb2f6ca8c2; 1e393812aed2882875d0ebf4f2dcd2a4818ec26c; cca962344028af18dcf9ffcc26fd76d2d917bc3d; 7f200bc991f9dd56b5f6a000edd85adbe856cd2d; 1ff8386b3265942f66210ce1cd27ea968c8e04e3; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; f1f34f5e536fcd1432c49d8af5a0fbe2e244ffd0,Pediatric Research,79,473 - 481
5bb342a97cbc091fe60829307037bb1fb422d9f2,TITLE-Characterization of a naturally occurring breast cancer subset enriched in EMT and stem cell characteristics Running title-Metaplastic breast cancer characterization,"Metaplastic breast cancers (MBCs) are aggressive, chemoresistant tumors characterized by lineage plasticity. To advance understanding of their pathogenesis and relatedness to other breast cancer subtypes, twenty-eight MBCs were compared with common breast cancers using comparative genomic hybridization, transcriptional profiling, reverse phase protein arrays and by sequencing for common breast cancer mutations. MBCs demonstrated unique DNA copy number aberrations compared with common breast cancers. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 9/19 MBCs (47.4%) versus 80/232 hormone receptor-positive cancers (34.5%; p=0.32), 17/75 HER2-positive samples (22.7%; p=0.04), 20/240 basal-like cancers (8.3%; p<0.0001) and 0/14 claudin-low tumors (p=0.004). Of 7 PI3K/AKT pathway phosphorylation sites, six were more highly phosphorylated in MBCs than in other breast tumor subtypes. The majority of MBCs displayed mRNA profiles different from those of most common including basal-like cancers. By transcriptional profiling, MBCs and the recently identified claudin-low breast cancer subset constitute related receptor-negative subgroups characterized by low expression of GATA3-regulated genes and of genes responsible for cell-cell adhesion with enrichment for markers linked to stem cell function and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast to other breast cancers, claudin-low tumors and most MBCs showed a significant similarity to a â€œtumorigenicâ€ signature defined using CD44+/CD24breast tumor-initiating stem cell-like cells. MBCs and claudin-low tumors are thus enriched in EMT and stem cell-like features, and may arise from an earlier, more chemoresistant breast epithelial precursor than basal-like or luminal cancers. PIK3CA mutations, EMT and stem cell-like characteristics likely contribute to the poor outcomes of MBC and suggest novel therapeutic targets. INTRODUCTION Metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBCs) are aggressive estrogen receptor (ERÎ±)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) tumors characterized by mesenchymal/sarcomatoid and/or squamous metaplasia of malignant breast epithelium (1-7). Because of limited understanding of their pathogenesis, MBCs are treated in the same fashion as basal-like or triple receptor-negative ductal cancers. However, while neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with high pathologic complete response rates in basal-like carcinomas, MBCs are usually chemoresistant (2). Transcriptional profiling has defined breast cancer subtypes (8,9). The origin of luminal A and B tumors appears to be the mammary duct luminal epithelium with concomitant hormone receptor expression. Elevated HER2 expression defines a subgroup with a poor prognosis; however, the responsiveness of this subgroup to trastuzumab improves outcomes (10). In contrast, basal-like cancers likely represent multiple different subtypes arising from distinct precursor cells from those of other cancers. Some basal-like breast cancers likely arise from mammary myoepithelial cells. To date, basal-like cancers have not presented specific therapy targets. As MBCs are triple-negative, they are distinct from luminal and HER2-amplified cancers. As they express some markers associated with basal-like cancers (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytokeratins 5/6), MBCs are proposed to represent a form of basal-like breast cancer. However, distinct clinical features such as chemoresistance suggest that MBCs may represent a unique subtype (2,3). We applied an integrated genomic-proteomic approach to determine mechanisms underlying metaplastic carcinogenesis and MBC chemoresistance along with the relatedness of MBCs to known breast cancer subtypes. Most MBCs showed a unique molecular profile and form a distinct subtype most closely related to a novel subset of receptor-negative breast cancers (claudin-low) characterized by loss of genes involved in cell-cell adhesion. An enrichment for stem cell-like and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MBCs (and claudin-low tumors) along with frequent genomic aberrations that activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway suggest reasons for MBC chemoresistance and that MBCs and claudin-low tumors may arise from more immature precursor cells than other breast cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Human tumors Twenty-eight frozen grade 3 MBCs with sarcomatoid (19) or squamous (9) metaplasia were obtained from the Breast Tumor Bank at M.D.Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and from a collaborator in Valencia (A.L.). The diagnosis was reconfirmed by pathologists at MDACC (M.G./S.K.) (2,3). Frozen tissue was used for DNA extraction (28 tumors) and, where adequate frozen tumor tissue remained, for RNA and protein extraction (16 MDACC tumors) (11). Three tumor cohorts were used for comparison to MBCs (Supplemental Figure 1). The first cohort, used for comparison of mutation frequency (547 tumors) and functional proteomic profiles (693), was composed of 693 frozen primary breast tumors obtained under IRB-approved protocols from MDACC. These tumors were subdivided into clinically-defined subtypes as described previously (Table 1) (12). A second cohort of 145 primary breast tumors was used for comparison to MBC gene copy number profiles herein (13,14). A third cohort (Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC)) of 184 breast tumors and 9 normal breast tissues was used for comparison with MBC transcriptional profiles (8,9,15). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients with tumors of different stages between the cohorts. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) CGH profiles from the 28 MBCs were generated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based GeneChipÂ® Human Mapping 50K Sty arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and compared to BACCGH profiles of primary breast tumors previously generated and processed (J.F.) at LBNL using HumArray1.14/HumArray2.0 (13,14,16-18). MBC 50K data are available. For comparison with LBNL tumors, the 28 MBC SNP chips were mapped to BAC resolution. This approach has been validated by comparing data derived using both platforms to analyze breast cancer cell lines (not shown). LBNL tumors were remapped to the May04 freeze from UCSC and regions around each BAC clone were defined as within a half distance to each neighboring clone or to the beginning or end of the i ftp://beamish.lbl.gov/njwang/ chromosome if telomeric. A median expression value was then obtained for SNPs in each BAC region. Missing values were assigned if <5 SNPs mapped to a particular region. Each array was recentered to have a median of 0. The resulting values were segmented using Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) followed by a merge-level procedure to combine segmented levels across the genome. Each missing value was assigned the value of its corresponding segment. Gain/loss events and fraction of genome altered were calculated. After this resolution reduction (median=18 SNPs/BAC;mean=30), the mean variability estimate was 0.25. Similar analyses beginning with the CBS steps were performed on the original dChip processed data. We used a Fisherâ€™s test to measure the difference in copy number at probes on each side of genes encoding PI3K/AKT pathway components. These p-values were used to fit a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) model to determine significance at a given false discovery rate (FDR). To directly compare the 50K SNP and older BAC platforms, DNA extracted from five MBCs was also run using the BAC platform. This confirmed a high concordance for the matched data derived from the two platforms (not shown). Detection of mutations DNA was extracted from 547 MDACC breast tumors along with 14 LCCC claudin-low breast tumors and 19 MBCs with sufficient remaining DNA for mutation detection (9,11,12). Following whole genome amplification, p53/PTEN genes were resequenced (19). CTNNB1 exon 3 (the most common site of mutations) was amplified from genomic DNA using a forward primer located at the 5' portion and a reverse primer at the 3' end of the exon. A tumor sample with a known CTNNB1 mutation was amplified and sequenced in parallel with tumor samples as a positive control. A SNP-based approach (Sequenom (San Diego, CA) MassArray) was used to detect mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS and E17K mutations in the AKT1/2/3 genes (12,20). This approach is unsuitable for detection of mutations that are not â€˜hot spotâ€™ mutations but is particularly suitable to mutation detection in breast cancer where stromal â€˜contaminationâ€™ is prevalent (21). Reverse phase protein lysate array (RPPA) RPPA was applied with the antibodies in Supplemental Table 1 to compare PI3K/AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation in protein lysates derived from 16 MBCs versus 693 common breast cancers (Supplemental Table 2) (2225). The expression of each antibody in a sample was corrected for protein loading using the average expression levels of all probed proteins. Transcriptional profiling Total RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction (Trizol, GIBCO/BRL), and mRNA was purified by either magnetic separation using Dynabeads (Dynal) or the Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 Kit. Twelve of 16 MBC RNA samples with RNA integrity numbers (RINs)>6 were assayed on Agilent oligomicroarrays at LCCC and compared with a published Agilent microarray data set also previously assayed and processed (C.M.P.) at LCCC (8,9,15). The microarray and clinical data are available at UNC Microarray Database and in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE10885). Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) was applied to perform functional analysis of gene lists.

As no human studies have investigated these changes in detail, our objective was to describe the dynamics of major follicular fluid (FF) hormones and transcription of steroidogenic enzymes and steroid receptors in human granulosa cells (GCs) during ovulation. We conducted a prospective cohort study at a public fertility clinic in 2016-2018. Fifty women undergoing ovarian stimulation for fertility treatment were included. From each woman, FF and GCs were collected by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicle puncture of one follicle at two specific time points during ovulation, and the study covered a total of five time points: before ovulation induction (OI), 12, 17, 32 and 36 hours after OI. Follicular fluid concentrations of oestradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone inhibin A and inhibin B were measured using ELISA assays, and a statistical mixed model was used to analyse differences in hormone levels between time points. Gene expression of 33 steroidogenic enzymes and six hormone receptors in GCs across ovulation were assessed by microarray analysis and selected genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR. We found that concentrations of oestradiol, testosterone, progesterone, AMH, inhibin A and inhibin B (p < 0.001) and gene expression of 12 steroidogenic enzymes and five receptors (false discovery rate < 0.0001) changed significantly during ovulation. Furthermore, we found parallel changes in plasma hormones.

9bd4f58c48259770deec1850bd117af05a72d671,Detection of Simultaneous Group Effects in MicroRNA Expression and Related Target Gene Sets,"Expression levels of mRNAs are among other factors regulated by microRNAs. A particular microRNA can bind specifically to several target mRNAs and lead to their degradation. Expression levels of both, mRNAs and microRNAs, can be obtained by microarray experiments. In order to increase the power of detecting microRNAs that are differentially expressed between two different groups of samples, we incorporate expression levels of their related target gene sets. Group effects are determined individually for each microRNA, and by enrichment tests and global tests for target gene sets. The resulting lists of p-values from individual and set-wise testing are combined by means of meta analysis. We propose a new approach to connect microRNA-wise and gene set-wise information by means of p-value combination as often used in meta-analysis. In this context, we evaluate the usefulness of different approaches of gene set tests. In a simulation study we reveal that our combination approach is more powerful than microRNA-wise testing alone. Furthermore, we show that combining microRNA-wise results with 'competitive' gene set tests maintains a pre-specified false discovery rate. In contrast, a combination with 'self-contained' gene set tests can harm the false discovery rate, particularly when gene sets are not disjunct.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephan Artmann"", ids = ""3472178""); list(name = ""Klaus Jung"", ids = ""144268096""); list(name = ""Annalen Bleckmann"", ids = ""47926274""); list(name = ""Tim BeiÃŸbarth"", ids = ""4472076"")",32f42726b9989f85b3bea21804f720c396b95e0d; 2f59ac9b9e4e6a8eb088d6eb711fb5508906e146; 608644f3b1f3664a4f5d42112716fce7db1fc9e7; 87dcfab3dac6bc194dce6aea49224057716e70b4; 1d048c51f5d61858733ed34581941b6334ff2880; bf4b4c751171aee89108efa41cfae10cb7453adf; ecf0f13ef69c4a01c1bb455c71f0e8e77e448cb9; 57c1aa4b9332a189c3d24e6d5c3e6a4f114a46f3; 63080899729137d173e3424598deb137462e6ff0; 35c8c268945dd14381074c0a8001e7ee17a15cc5; 339922763859e47ddeb6af3bca482d42ff11116c; 4350ba7bfdaa35d7c34c209fb936879ac38d8409; bd90f3bb114a398c33637247f5870cb217a92316,68feef61b8a5dbb54ec3bdf7591dda0ee39f397d; 2009b74d83b6d9b4e121f271d63170cb47283680; c7497d6d32d3dd6f893609a17848c807134e1cc4; 748094a393cb8a7a184b272ee9bbb9fc7a6e2327; 0fcc1f646b60923985d5a436470a13ad8185f04f; f70431e51a2d3d9dcd845f5eb61d34bc30895251; 2b2294ae88646efc62eb58d3383b749216f4adc3; 6f8e263330a1b4abb82dfed682965836fd026ced; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 7bdafc53f96f0282c17b082a41b67d76cb24d957; 59eb429a8a3a545efdb8f1f8382c43d02c683851; 9f8ebab89f02b5f4fa154028ae04d6456c93d9c3; cf2011180602877ba7690e813a9a8568868cbed9; fc1fd4702ddaf6e307e07919096257abb6799f63; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b991352c899f483e5fe341b0bc3557157f4aace8; b802b297e40848652e9d3bf80b34d24fea1698bb; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 2558e9c1b3e10aadc22b8a589f5e0e18202fab72; f4a4d6ffbbca5103d4b2018345faf9fd821d0faa; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; e2f393d815d826b22ae36c7b606caf875ffecc9e; cdf832ab4fa74d503565396219758961775ca023; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 50684a874507f34ab249c51b1b2e6a04d162ae08; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 9616f36d11b0e83159716b5dfdd14cfc060a8ebc; 1746ef5dd71d1c7e3b41fb59d06f7970d19a16d6; 28a215515d10b0ccadef846c61894e2e8a4ff65a; dd6029e758bc04391461bb63c86d772277cd5be9; 2d30e0016b1a79276869f4fc1031625edaa648fa; 9fe2d0cda6d19d93cb31b1e1871131ef5d23aab1; 4ecf57ddc97c4ba6175886b40e04effd4ef639c1; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990,PLoS ONE,7,

Anhedonia can present in children and predict detrimental clinical outcomes.


Objective
To map anhedonia in children onto changes in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation and to probe the specificity of these changes in anhedonia against other clinical phenotypes (low mood, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]).


Design, Setting, and Participants
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were from the first annual release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, collected between September 2016 and September 2017 and analyzed between April and September 2018. Cross-sectional data of children aged 9 to 10 years from unreferred, community samples during rest (nâ€‰=â€‰2878) and during reward anticipation (nâ€‰=â€‰2874) and working memory (nâ€‰=â€‰2745) were analyzed.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Alterations in fMRI data during rest, reward anticipation, and working memory were examined, using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Functional MRI connectivity within large-scale networks, between networks, and between networks and subcortical regions were examined during rest. Functional MRI activation were examined during reward anticipation and working memory using the monetary incentive delayed and N-back tasks, respectively.


Results
Among 2878 children with adequate-quality resting-state fMRI data (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1400 girls [48.6%]), children with anhedonia (261 [9.1%]), compared with those without anhedonia (2617 [90.9%]), showed hypoconnectivity among various large-scale networks and subcortical regions, including between the arousal-related cingulo-opercular network and reward-related ventral striatum area (mean [SD] with anhedonia, 0.08 [0.10] vs without anhedonia,â€‰0.10 [0.10]; t2,876â€‰=â€‰3.33; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001; q[false discovery rate]â€‰=â€‰0.03; ln[Bayes factor10]â€‰=â€‰2.85). Such hypoconnectivity did not manifest among children with low mood (277 of 2878 [9.62%]), anxiety (109 of 2878 [3.79%]), or ADHD (459 of 2878 [15.95%]), suggesting specificity. Similarly, among 2874 children (mean [SD] age, 10.03 [0.62] years; 1414 girlsâ€‰[49.2%]) with high-quality task-evoked fMRI data, children with anhedonia (248 of 2874 [8.63%]) demonstrated hypoactivation during reward anticipation in various areas, including the dorsal striatum and areas of the cingulo-opercular network. This hypoactivity was not found among children with low mood (268 of 2874 [9.32%]), anxiety (90 of 2874 [3.13%]), or ADHD (473 of 2874 [16.46%]). Moreover, we also found context- and phenotype-specific double dissociations; while children with anhedonia showed altered activation during reward anticipation (but not working memory), those with ADHD showed altered activation during working memory (but not reward anticipation).


Conclusions and Relevance
Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study data set, phenotype-specific alterations were found in intrinsic large-scale connectivity and task-evoked activation in children with anhedonia. The hypoconnectivity at rest and hypoactivation during reward anticipation complementarily map anhedonia onto aberrations in neural-cognitive processes: lack of intrinsic reward-arousal integration during rest and diminishment of extrinsic reward-arousal activity during reward anticipation. These findings help delineate the pathophysiological underpinnings of anhedonia in children.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Narun Pornpattananangkul"", ids = ""4346535""); list(name = ""Ellen Leibenluft"", ids = ""8567882""); list(name = ""Daniel S.

f7a1c1f5aff06cfce9338ea524500025d69f76f4,Elevated SLC2A1 Expression Correlates with Poor Prognosis in Patients with Surgically Resected Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Study Based on Immunohistochemical Analysis and Bioinformatics.,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for an increasing proportion of non-small-cell lung cancer and an increasing number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, few biomarkers are available for prognosis and patient stratification. In all eight datasets from the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD cohorts, solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1) was significantly more highly expressed in LUAD tissue than in normal lung tissue. High SLC2A1 expression was also significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) associated with a poor prognosis in stage I, II, and III subgroups using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. In the National Cancer Center of China (NCC) cohort, SLC2A1 expression correlated significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) with several parameters, including sex, smoking history, tumor size, tumor differentiation, T stage, N stage, and pathologic TNM stage. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression indicated SLC2A1 to be an independent prognostic factor (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in both TCGA and NCC cohorts. Eleven hallmark pathways were significantly enriched (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01, false discovery rate <0.25) in the high-SLC2A1 expression group. SLC2A1 is a promising biomarker that can be used to predict the prognosis of LUAD.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Guo"", ids = ""153301546""); list(name = ""Sijin Sun"", ids = ""26624655""); list(name = ""Lei Guo"", ids = ""143621700""); list(name = ""Peng Song"", ids = ""66916193""); list(name = ""Xue-min Xue"", ids = ""31771888""); list(name = ""Huaming Zhang"", ids = ""49724045""); list(name = ""Guochao Zhang"", ids = ""1997341""); list(name = ""Renda Li"", ids = ""17829554""); list(name = ""Yibo Gao"", ids = ""2280938""); list(name = ""Bin Qiu"", ids = ""47359409""); list(name = ""Fengwei Tan"", ids = ""5434936""); list(name = ""Qi Xue"", ids = ""47335398""); list(name = ""Shugeng Gao"", ids = ""7356047""); list(name = ""Jie He"", ids = ""145456573"")",,,DNA and cell biology,,

Recent interest in poplars as a source of renewable energy, combined with the vast genomic resources available, has enabled further examination of their genetic diversity. â€¢ Forty candidate genes were resequenced in a panel of 15 unrelated individuals to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Eight hundred and seventy-six SNPs were successfully genotyped in a clonally replicated population (448 clones). The association population (average of 2.4 ramets per clone) was phenotyped using pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry. Both single-marker and haplotype-based association tests were implemented to identify associations for composite traits representing lignin content, syringyl : guaiacyl ratio and C6 sugars. â€¢ Twenty-seven highly significant, unique, single-marker associations (false discovery rate Q < 0.10) were identified across 40 candidate genes in three composite traits. Twenty-three significant haplotypes within 11 genes were discovered in two composite traits. â€¢ Given the rapid decay of within-gene linkage disequilibrium and the high coverage of amplicons across each gene, it is likely that the numerous polymorphisms identified are in close proximity to the causative SNPs and the haplotype associations reflect information present in the associations between markers.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jill L.

8653b99a21c2f0bfb1d62c97248ceb90ca7d8d12,Proteomic Analysis of Aqueous Humor from Primary Open Angle Glaucoma Patients on Drug Treatment Revealed Altered Complement Activation Cascade.,"Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a complex disease and a leading cause of irreversible blindness, and its underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Proteomic characterization of the protein composition of aqueous humor (AH) may identify prognostic candidate proteins involved in pathogenesis and progression of the disease. To delineate the possible mechanisms that lead to POAG, this study adopted state-of-art mass spectrometric technique and analyzed AH of POAG and their respective controls. In total, more than 1000 proteins were identified with false discovery rate of less than 1%. Numerous proteins of complement cascade, immunoglobulin, neuronal and amyloidogenic proteins, which were part of processes like acute-phase and inflammatory response, humoral immune and acute inflammatory response, regulation of complement activation and protein processing were identified. Proteins of complement system underwent significant changes, which correlate to pathogenic events characterizing POAG, including altered complement cascade, astrocyte activation, neural degeneration, and apoptosis. Further, protein modification such as deamidation of complement subcomponent was noted, particularly in POAG. Proteomic analysis of AH allows a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of POAG.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunil S Adav"", ids = ""36859925""); list(name = ""Jin Wei"", ids = ""145695381""); list(name = ""Yap Terence"", ids = ""46201178""); list(name = ""Bryan C H Ang"", ids = ""11492121""); list(name = ""Leonard Wei Leon Yip"", ids = ""144584886""); list(name = ""Siu Kwan Sze"", ids = ""145270497"")",33158d309c3c3915530321a753d5f71dcf2d7f81; 615153ccfad539216e75e4f5da6e915e0b8546d6; ed29964e59cc2942ef29b98874fd3694197f2514,,Journal of proteome research,17 7,"

a5b9d79a85fba998199bf9403697d41cb83abb1d,Estimators of the local false discovery rate designed for small numbers of tests,"Abstract Histogram-based empirical Bayes methods developed for analyzing data for large numbers of genes, SNPs, or other biological features tend to have large biases when applied to data with a smaller number of features such as genes with expression measured conventionally, proteins, and metabolites. To analyze such small-scale and medium-scale data in an empirical Bayes framework, we introduce corrections of maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the local false discovery rate (LFDR). In this context, the MLE estimates the LFDR, which is a posterior probability of null hypothesis truth, by estimating the prior distribution. The corrections lie in excluding each feature when estimating one or more parameters on which the prior depends. In addition, we propose the expected LFDR (ELFDR) in order to propagate the uncertainty involved in estimating the prior. We also introduce an optimally weighted combination of the best of the corrected MLEs with a previous estimator that, being based on a binomial distribution, does not require a parametric model of the data distribution across features. An application of the new estimators and previous estimators to protein abundance data illustrates the extent to which different estimators lead to different conclusions about which proteins are affected by cancer.A simulation study was conducted to approximate the bias of the new estimators relative to previous LFDR estimators. Data were simulated for two different numbers of features (N), two different noncentrality parameter values or detectability levels (dalt), and several proportions of unaffected features (p0). One of these previous estimators is a histogram-based estimator (HBE) designed for a large number of features. The simulations show that some of the corrected MLEs and the ELFDR that corrects the HBE reduce the negative bias relative to the MLE and the HBE, respectively.For every method, we defined the worst-case performance as the maximum of the absolute value of the bias over the two different dalt and over various p0. The best worst-case methods represent the safest methods to be used under given conditions. This analysis indicates that the binomial-based method has the lowest worst-case absolute bias for high p0 and for N = 3, 12. However, the corrected MLE that is based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle is the best worst-case method when the value of p0 is more uncertain since it has one of the lowest worst-case biases over all possible values of p0 and for N = 3, 12. Therefore, the safest estimator considered is the binomial-based method when a high proportion of unaffected features can be assumed and the MDL-based method otherwise.A second simulation study was conducted with additional values of N. We found that HBE requires N to be at least 6-12 features to perform as well as the estimators proposed here, with the precise minimum N depending on p0 and dalt.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marta Padilla"", ids = ""46579562""); list(name = ""David R.

824269af43bcd81e3459acb9ead9f08711abe93b,Default Mode Network Disruption in Stroke-Free Patients with Atrial Fibrillation,"Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a widely accepted risk for causing stroke. However, recent studies show AF as a risk factor for dementia, even without causing stroke. The mechanisms by which dementia develops in stroke-free patients with AF are still poorly understood and the association of AF with abnormal function of brain networks activities, such as the default mode network (DMN), has not been previously studied. We aimed to determine whether, in the absence of stroke and dementia, patients with AF have abnormal resting-state brain networks compared to controls without AF. Methods: Twenty-one stroke-free patients with AF and 21 age- and sex-matched controls without AF underwent brain functional magnetic resonance imaging acquired at a 3.0 Tesla scanner. During the exam, the subjects were instructed to lie still with eyes closed. At first-level analysis, connectivity of the DMN was obtained for all subjects. Second-level analysis compared the DMN connectivity between AF patients and controls with a general linear model (two-sample t test, p < 0.05, False Discovery Rate corrected, minimum of 50 contiguous voxels). Results: Patients with AF compared with controls showed decreased connectivity in regions of the DMN including the frontal lobe (left medial frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate), left angular gyrus, and bilateral precuneus. Conclusions: Stroke-free patients with AF have evidence of abnormal DMN connectivity. This study adds evidence to the occurrence of cerebral dysfunction in patients with AF.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Danilo dos Santos Silva"", ids = ""30635680""); list(name = ""Wagner Mauad Avelar"", ids = ""3810199""); list(name = ""Brunno Machado de Campos"", ids = ""38312609""); list(name = ""Ana Paula Beppler Lazaro Lino"", ids = ""35745763""); list(name = ""MÃ¡rcio Luiz Figueredo Balthazar"", ids = ""38769210""); list(name = ""Marcio J O Figueiredo"", ids = ""17611305""); list(name = ""Fernando Cendes"", ids = ""144366416""); list(name = ""Ana Carolina Coan"", ids = ""1816096"")",888406874650a590184ccca57f165a8172226cd0,6679ea5c8dd310703e3844970d092347c84669ab; 3aa498aaba0d4defe373ce9f0fe0d9b10a3acecb; 6ee1bc5b9dea640ba451db05c01cbd2f51d7a5f9; ae01ab13029729d00d5e651378616376952ae23d; adbf8fb8d73357ce32fcd4c2edf41f3948a4d507; a81ab9c8711692bc0a250ddf010fcaef166f1660; d1ea37260aca3638fc55672028cc77ed09030e65; e5e0098dd8f4915bb02aade72c8aa11376416b3a; 894593c82587dfe17f71e841566b8f3dfc172468; 485e5241380b870f7d2ddeb571315f67fa0a7259; ecbda4b3fe976cacd02f2f01e919497f756609dc; 0d82f8ab39814c4d8b6fd60df967e6c43de20474; 165fd770b8893f8511852d44f4d4ac7241eebeeb; 89aced1ea80086be28ffc1fbe268e8ecc8c5e600; af2688d809ad91bab14c15f03a0e35556d0bd72b; bbd128ef74a337355e9c20541f35089d70bea456; b227daa24c2e09a689e13d9167818e8418228f1e; 12c431efad1b2cc69472609728069b4f2fb930af; bbb21d5b23b136d6d960a1e33e8b194a3f2b65dd; 4f6c5b37d8df9482016371335aaf179dfacfbee8; 32733d544da5704463f12d05c1a3ab0582156a49; 3d817620494190605c4c5869258ef4fa93236860; c1ab5f9f239f8b252d397c9104133f20ac46e8ae; a305865e91a194804364263254a745f68a44477e; 9a2258cc8fd88f2602b67daf71e9b1bfce22fb2e; 9977183cdc2a52e9e9b2db91e36c7385ab0b5e29; 363b2364f12881d0c02fb63e99429a67107ddd14; e64a00afa1ca1066774fbdf09822c906de9a4fbb; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 32c32d3f7e3a3f62de04f8d304d152e79d17dd07; 06cad9f2b564f517d3eb2ad498f7aa44ea34409c; 0ee43dc24c3a4545f2cf1b2d3d2ae33793b9fcbf; 13317deb433d4f2056f84dce6d37cbf9ec03a36c,Cerebrovascular Diseases,45,78 - 84

We identified 103 specifically expressed genes in the NSLN negative group and 47 in the NSLN positive group. Among them, FABP1 (negative group) and CYP2A13 (positive group) were the only 2 protein-encoding genes with expression levels in the 8th to 10th deciles. Using a false discovery rate threshold of <0.05, 62 up-regulated genes and 98 down-regulated genes were discovered in the NSLN positive group.

Medication fill rates for a 6 month period prior to the active use of the electronic clinical reminder were compared with fill rates for a 12 month period after electronic reminder use. We found no significant difference in fill rates between the pre- and post-reminder periods. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model tested whether medication fill rates were affected by electronic reminders. Apparent differences in fill rates before and after implementing clinical reminders disappeared after controlling for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate; therefore data was pooled across years (antihypertensive medications (AH), p = 0.80 and lipid-lowering agent medication (LL), p = 0.30). Changes in fill rates for AH and LL were similar to each other (p = 0.37). A Cox Proportional Hazard Regression model was used to determine the predictors of survival between the 6-month time period prior to the clinical reminder versus the 6-month time period after the reminder was actively used. The clinical reminders for both AHM and LLA were not significantly associated with survival (p = 0.45, hazard ratio = 2.2, confidence intervals 0.29-16). These results do not support the use of electronic clinical reminders in this setting. Instead, these findings support questioning the utility of individual electronic record clinical reminders.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""C Karimkhani"", ids = ""4853493""); list(name = ""Cynthia L Venendaal"", ids = ""66985652""); list(name = ""Weston T.

1d5996f89ca5b84a53e655b35df10636aa12805a,A cross-validation based estimation of the proportion of true null hypotheses,"Abstract In the multiple testing context, a challenging problem is the estimation of the proportion Ï€ 0 of true null hypotheses. A large number of estimators of this quantity rely on identifiability assumptions that either appear to be violated on real data, or can be at least relaxed. The proposed estimator Ï€ ^ 0 results from density estimation by histograms, and cross-validation. Several consistency results are derived under independence. A new (plug-in) multiple testing procedure (MTP) is also described, based on the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure (BH-procedure) and the proposed estimator. This procedure is asymptotically optimal, provides the asymptotic desired false discovery rate (FDR) control, and is more powerful than the BH-procedure. The non-asymptotic behavior of Ï€ ^ 0 is finally assessed through several simulation experiments. It outperforms numerous existing estimators in usual settings, and remains accurate with â€œU-shapeâ€ densities where other estimators usually fail. It does not exhibit any strong sensitivity to dependence. With m block-structured dependent data, it stays reliable up to a within block correlation Ï = 0.5 , when m/50 blocks are used.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alain Celisse"", ids = ""2123723""); list(name = ""StÃ©phane Robin"", ids = ""91133707"")",2e141a30d87439989da6b839c2db85777b99cc6a; ab4643d6cd39827dff0f1bad703e502ad7aa1229; 30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e; 12b7d0e559b4e601c632e4cce84920eb6175b714; 1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 9b7944d85138c4b6a31f667a6f1c585b8e97cf7c; 8156ebc5c1b147f9b77040c1d9d2595d7f18fe20; 70e2055680026282675e90b4bb8c455be84e5ce7; 21c0b717c8e7e6947f675eb275334f9eff7d6944; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c; 81b701cffbe068270e50481a4c97a2d584c9ad52; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 522a22f15190643e99bdd4a14357665443216260,,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,140,3132-3147
173eed1e528b646e3d9162e772419d311244c5d7,Neurexin gene family variants as risk factors for autism spectrum disorder.,"Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal synaptic function leads to neuronal developmental disorders and is an important component of the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that affect the function of synapses and mediate the conduction of nerve signals. Thus, neurexins are attractive candidate genes for autism. Since gene families have greater power to reveal genetic association than single genes, we designed this case-control study to investigate six genetic variants in three neurexin genes (NRXN1, NRXN2, and NRXN3) in a Chinese population including 529 ASD patients and 1,923 healthy controls. We found that two SNPs were significantly associated with ASD after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple comparisons. The NRXN2 rs12273892 polymorphism T allele and AT genotype were significantly associated with increased risk of ASD (respectively: ORâ€‰=â€‰1.328, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.133-1.557, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001; ORâ€‰=â€‰1.528; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.249-1.868, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The dominant model showed the same association (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.495, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.231-1.816, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The NRXN3 rs12879016 polymorphism played a significant role in ASD susceptibility under the dominant model (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.747, 95% CI= 0.615-0.908, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.023), with the same trend detected for the G allele and GT genotype (respectively: ORâ€‰=â€‰0.811, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.699-0.941, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.036; ORâ€‰=â€‰0.755, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.615-0.928, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.035). In conclusion, this study supports the importance of two genetic variants in the neurexin gene family in ASD susceptibility in China. Autism Res 2018, 11: 37-43.

LAY SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly heritable, and studies have found a number of candidate genes that might contribute to ASD. Neurexins are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that affect the function of synapses and mediate the conduction of nerve signals, and they play an important role in normal brain development and become candidate genes for autism. The purpose of our study is to explore the association between variants of the neurexins gene family and ASD in a Chinese population through a case-control study.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jia Wang"", ids = ""40579677""); list(name = ""Jianhua Gong"", ids = ""47782958""); list(name = ""Li Li"", ids = ""47681162""); list(name = ""Yanlin Chen"", ids = ""49069174""); list(name = ""Lingfei Liu"", ids = ""6626699""); list(name = ""Huaiting Gu"", ids = ""27033553""); list(name = ""Xiu Bo Luo"", ids = ""48122343""); list(name = ""Fang Hou"", ids = ""145991953""); list(name = ""Jiajia Zhang"", ids = ""2128483""); list(name = ""Ranran Song"", ids = ""33797621"")",451d2b6ecab779ec8dd73f6c70be0ffd9b102376; b793bf97a0cfc83c7f5f808562024ee8d355eae4; 3d26ad976cdae609b2f9a7a415a728d981b78257; 9c7539ebb53cd2951c6b3ec55e856e2d8b3e38ac; 54a601c5673f09e3040e4724e5adeaa85184c8c5; 93523353c9b8f71582fb19aa70c15ab86edfa86b; ae6a3a8dc2a0d89dd4b7026220049b8b6ceab3b2; 20f2606feb08119b34c84b89baf574dc5277c0a0; ca35b5c321b3ff6c755daa51ac9ff159064b8229; 3c9058547d8c21a81bfe614f48f948350bcfcf10; 7bfe6f8824d75182975e1c9e583fdb3be839e50b; 924d05bf39df49817d7693d12fad788567456d82,,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,11 1,"

18117d877af7396d2a855cc03b0694c447b795c9,FRI0538 Validation of A Semi-Automatic Algorithm for Defining Cortical Breaks in Finger Joints Using High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative CT by Microct,"Background High-Resolution peripheral QCT (HR-pQCT) imaging has a higher sensitivity in the detection of breaks compared to conventional radiography (1). Cortical bone in the finger joints is very thin ($â‰ˆ $100Î¼m) and it is therefore possible that the HR-pQCT is not able to detect these thin structures. An automatic algorithm that is based on binary images can therefore falsely identify these regions as breaks. To investigate the extent of this error, cortical break detection on HR-pQCT was compared to that on Î¼CT with a higher resolution. Objectives To investigate the proportion of falsely detected breaks with a semi-automatic algorithm on HR-pQCT compared to Î¼CT. Methods Nineteen finger joints of ten human female cadaveric index fingers (mean age Â± SD; 85.1 Â± 9.6 years) with unknown medical history were imaged by HR-pQCT and Î¼CT (82 and 18Î¼m isotropic voxel sizes, respectively). A semi-automatic algorithm was applied to HR-pQCT and Î¼CT for the detection of cortical breaks. First, the outer margin of the bone structure was contoured. Second, the bone within 0.25mm from this contour was selected as cortical region. Last, different sizes for defining a cortical break (>0.50mm, >0.66mm and >0.82mm) were applied and evaluated. Î¼CT images were registered to HR-pQCT in order to compare the locations of the detected breaks. The false discovery rate (FDR) of breaks detected on HR-pQCT was calculated, with Î¼CT as reference. Results The number of breaks depended on the image modality and chosen break size, and varied between 0.8 and 20.8 breaks per joint (table 1). The locations of the detected breaks on HR-pQCT and Î¼CT generally correspond well (Fig 1-I). On HR-pQCT, however, breaks may be detected as large breaks, whereas on Î¼CT these large breaks appear to represent a combination of several small breaks (Fig 1-II). With larger break diameters as a cut-off for both techniques, this resulted in the detection of breaks on HR-pQCT which were not detected on Î¼CT. Therefore, the FDR for the detection of a break of the same size was sufficient for small breaks (37.9%), but poor for large break sizes (86.7%). However, when comparing a larger break on HR-pQCT with the smallest minimal break size on Î¼CT it was found that only 4.4% of the detected breaks on HR-pQCT were falsely detected (table 1). Conclusions Because of its limited resolution, a single break region detected on HR-pQCT can appear as several smaller breaks on Î¼CT. When accounting for this effect, however, excellent agreement is found between cortical break detected with the algorithm using HR-pQCT and Î¼CT. We thus conclude that the use of HR-pQCT in combination with our semi-automatic algorithm is a promising tool for early detection and monitoring of the number of small cortical breaks in finger joints.

We conducted a prospective serum metabolomic analysis of fatal prostate cancer risk in 523 cases and 523 matched controls nested within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Median time from baseline fasting serum collection to prostate cancer death was 18 years (interdecile range 10-26 years). We profiled 860 known metabolites through an ultrahigh-performance LC-MS/MS platform, and conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of risk associated with 1-standard deviation increases in the log-metabolite signals. Based on a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.15 or lower, 34 metabolites are identified as being associated with fatal prostate cancer. Notably, increased serum thioproline and the three cysteine-related amino acids combined (thioproline, cysteine and cystine) are associated with lower odds of fatal disease (OR=0.75 and 0.71, respectively; Pâ‰¤8.2Ã—10 -5 ). In contrast, the serum dipeptide leucylglycine (OR=1.36, P=8.2Ã—10 -5 ), and three gamma-glutamyl amino acids, including gamma-glutamylvaline, gamma-glutamylglycine and gamma-glutamylleucine (OR=1.28-1.30, Pâ‰¤4.6Ã—10 -4 ), are associated with increased fatal disease risk. Several other dipeptides including histidylalanine, valylglycine and leucylglutamine, as well as the nucleotides dihydroorotate, pseudouridine, 29-O-methyluridine, 5,6-dihydrouridine and 5-methyluridine (ribothymidine), also have significant positive associations with fatal disease risk. Findings are not materially altered by adjustment for body mass index, smoking, serum total and HDL cholesterol, serum alpha-tocopherol and retinol, or the ATBC trial supplementation. Our results are also similar across strata of time from blood collection to prostate cancer death and age at blood collection.

7b8ee5f597e6c3664de96d976f918fde17d47dd2,Gene expression signatures of coronary heart disease.,"OBJECTIVE
To identify transcriptomic biomarkers of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 188 cases with CHD and 188 age- and sex-matched controls who were participants in the Framingham Heart Study.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
A total of 35 genes were differentially expressed in cases with CHD versus controls at false discovery rate<0.5, including GZMB, TMEM56, and GUK1. Cluster analysis revealed 3 gene clusters associated with CHD, 2 linked to increased erythrocyte production and a third to reduced natural killer and T cell activity in cases with CHD. Exon-level results corroborated and extended the gene-level results. Alternative splicing analysis suggested that GUK1 and 38 other genes were differentially spliced in cases with CHD versus controls. Gene Ontology analysis linked ubiquitination and T-cell-related pathways with CHD.


CONCLUSIONS
Two bioinformatically defined groups of genes show consistent associations with CHD. Our findings are consistent with the hypotheses that hematopoesis is upregulated in CHD, possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism, and that innate immune activity is disrupted in CHD or altered by its treatment. Transcriptomic signatures may be useful in identifying pathways associated with CHD and point toward novel therapeutic targets for its treatment and prevention.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roby Joehanes"", ids = ""2770659""); list(name = ""Saixia Ying"", ids = ""39048362""); list(name = ""Tianxiao Huan"", ids = ""2789524""); list(name = ""Andrew D.

9ef77fa754a6db569f8c416dc6096e22ab74a24b,Changes in child functioning pre-to post-neuropsychological evaluation.,"Although a key goal of neuropsychological evaluation is to improve patient outcomes, research regarding changes in child functioning following neuropsychological evaluation is very limited. This project examined changes from before neuropsychological evaluation to several months afterward in parent report of their child's functioning and ability to participate across home, school, and community settings.Fifty-one parents of children and adolescents receiving their first outpatient neuropsychological evaluation completed questionnaires prior to initial parent interview and following the final report (of n = 162 who were mailed the follow-up questionnaire). Parents rated their perception of the severity of their child's problems, their child's ability to participate, and satisfaction with the child's ability to participate across school, home, and community domains. Analysis utilized MANOVA with bootstrapping to obtain standard errors and false discovery rate to control Type-1 errors. Parents reported a significant decrease in the severity of problems related to academic progress (p = .034) and overall severity of problems (p = .028) at follow-up. There was no significant change in the rated severity of the child's problems with peers or family. Parents reported significant increases in their child's ability to participate, and parent satisfaction with child participation, in school (ps<.001), at home (ps<.01), and in the community (ps<.001).Although this observational study cannot definitively show cause-and-effect, findings support the utility of pediatric neuropsychological evaluations in facilitating child functioning. These findings dovetail with prior work suggesting that such evaluations can increase parents' understanding of their child, awareness of care options, and efficacy in pursuing those options.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Tarra Combs"", ids = ""40153743""); list(name = ""Dean W.

57558bb6a9972eb2e777ed40e5d6b792c83774d4,Impact of severe OSA during REM sleep on cardiac and inflammatory protein levels,"Background: Proteomic-based technologies offer new possibilities to identify altered levels of cardiac and inflammatory proteins that might reflect the cardiometabolic stress caused by different measures of OSA. Aim: To investigate the effects of OSA on the cardiovascular system by analysing a broad panel of cardiac and inflammatory proteins in relationship to different measures of OSA in a population based cohort of women. Method: In the â€œSleep and Health in Womenâ€ (SHE) cohort study, 400 women underwent polysomnography, anthropometric measurements and blood sampling. Two proteomic assays (Olink Proseek Â® Inflammation panel and Cardiovascular II panel), each measuring 92 proteins, were analysed in a subsample of 253 women. Results: In unadjusted models, with false discovery rate set to 10%, 57 proteins were associated with AHI, 56 proteins with ODI and 64 proteins with REM AHI. After adjustment for age, BMI and plate there were no significant associations between AHI or ODI and any of the proteins. REM AHI>30 was associated with decreased levels of two proteins involved in anti-inflammatory processes; Sirt2 (q-value 0.016) and LAP-TGFs 1 (q-value 0.016). There was further a negative association between REM AHI>30 and Axin1 (q-value 0.095), a protein known to facilitate TGFs signalling. Conclusion: Severe OSA during REM sleep affected the plasma levels of Sirt2, LAP-TGFs1 and Axin1. For overall AHI and ODI the associations with cardiac and inflammatory proteins were weakerÂ and to a large extentÂ explained by age and BMI.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mirjam Ljunggren"", ids = ""32433212""); list(name = ""Jenny Theorell-HaglÃ¶w"", ids = ""1398782328""); list(name = ""Eva Freyhult"", ids = ""50603038""); list(name = ""Andrei Malinovschi"", ids = ""144172760""); list(name = ""Christer Janson"", ids = ""145403659""); list(name = ""Eva Lindberg"", ids = ""144749516"")",,,ERJ Open Research,5,45
000c021cc296b72bb72fa71e3091af594a6c9c87,Effects of genetic variation on the dynamics of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease,"Although many genetic markers are identified as being associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), not much is known about their association with the structural changes that happen as the disease progresses. In this study, we investigate the genetic etiology of neurodegeneration in AD by associating genetic markers with atrophy profiles obtained using patient data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The atrophy profiles were quantified using a linear least-squares regression model over the span of patient enrollment, and used as imaging features throughout the analysis. A subset of the imaging features were selected for genetic association based on their ability to discriminate between healthy individuals and AD patients in a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. Each imaging feature was associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a linear model that included age and cognitive impairment scores as covariates to correct for normal disease progression. After false discovery rate correction, we observed 53 significant associations between SNPs and our imaging features, including associations of ventricular enlargement with SNPs on estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1), hippocampal atrophy with SNPs on ESR1, and cerebral atrophy with SNPs on transferrin (TF) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). This study provides important insights into genetic predictors of specific types of neurodegeneration that could potentially be used to improve the efficacy of treatment strategies for the disease and allow the development of personalized treatment plans based on each patient's unique genetic profile.",2014,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Blake P.

299d7815e7396fcb2d318b3877e7450ba8e94cab,Transcriptional Profiling of Gbm Invasive Genes Identifies Effective Inhibitors of the Lim Kinase-cofilin Pathway,"BACKGROUND: The malignant astrocytoma is a highly proliferative and invasive neoplasm that infiltrates diffusely into regions of normal brain rendering total surgical resection impossible and effective local radiation therapy difficult. For truly significant advances to be made in the treatment of patients with malignant astrocytoma, we must develop a greater understanding of the molecular machinery driving invasion and identify novel treatment targets. METHODS: We recently compared gene-expression data of 400 invasion/migration genes by performing microarray analysis comparing 10 normal brain samples versus 51 mesenchymal GBM, which are highly invasive, and of poor prognosis. RESULTS: We identified over 141 significant genes with a 1.5 fold change (p-value <0.05, and a false discovery rate (q < 0.05) compared to normal brain. Of the 141 genes, the cofilin pathway, which disassembles actin filaments (namely LIMK1, LIMK2, CFL, CAP1) was highly up-regulated compared to normal brain. Furthermore we identified up-regulation of LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 (LIMK1/2) that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin (CFL) in an additional data set comparing normal brain to GBM. Using a well-characterized tissue microarray of 20 GBM patients for which a central and a matched periphery sample was available we undertook immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of LIMK1 and pCFL. We observed significant expression of LIMK1 in the periphery of the GBM compared to the center (11/20 in the periphery versus 2/20 in the center). Previously, we established that pCFL plays an integral role in GBM invasion. Consequently we explored how to target this pathway using small molecule inhibitors. We tested the LIMK1 and LIMK2 inhibitors BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I. Both BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I inhibited p-CFL at the protein level at 10uM and 100nM respectively in U87 cells. Using the MTT cell viability assay, we observed significant decrease in cell viability in U87 and T98G cells using doses of 10-20uM BMS-5 and 100nM-10uM Cucurbitacin I while no cytotoxic effect was seen in normal human astrocytes that lack LIMK expression. Both BMS-5 (10uM) and Cucurbitacin I (100nM) promoted increased adhesion in U87 and T98G cells. Interestingly, BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I reduced migration and invasion of both U87 and T98G cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the use of LIMK inhibitors to target the invasive machinery in GBM are attractive candidates to move forward with in preclinical trials.

We examined pleiotropic genetic effects on cognitive impairment conditioned on genetic variants (SNPs) associated with systemic inflammation as measured by CRP and with plasma lipids using data from the Health and Retirement Study. SNP enrichment was observed for cognitive impairment conditioned on the secondary phenotypes of plasma CRP and lipids. Fold enrichment of 100%-800% was observed for increasingly stringent p-value thresholds for SNPs associated with cognitive impairment conditional on plasma CRP, 80%-800% for low-density lipoprotein, and 80%-600% for total cholesterol. Significant associations (false discovery rate Q â‰¤ 0.05) between cognitive impairment, conditional with either CRP, low-density lipoprotein, or total cholesterol, were found for the locus on chromosome 19 that contains the APOE, TOMM40, APOC1, and PVRL2 genes. Relative numbers of significant SNPs in each of the genes differed by the conditional associations with the secondary phenotypes. Biological interpretation of both the genetic pleiotropy results and the individual genome-wide association results showed that the variants and proximal genes identified are involved in multiple pathological processes including cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial transport.

We characterized the soluble mucosal proteome associated with elevated cytokine expression in the female reproductive tract. A scoring system was devised based on the elevation (upper quartile) of at least three of seven inflammatory cytokines in cervicovaginal lavage. Using this score, HIV-uninfected Kenyan women were classified as either having EMC (n=28) or not (n=68). Of 455 proteins quantified in proteomic analyses, 53 were associated with EMC (5% false discovery rate threshold). EMCs were associated with proteases, cell motility, and actin cytoskeletal pathways, whereas protease inhibitor, epidermal cell differentiation, and cornified envelope pathways were decreased. Multivariate analysis identified an optimal signature of 16 proteins that distinguished the EMC group with 88% accuracy. Three proteins in this signature were neutrophil-associated proteases that correlated with many cytokines, especially GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), IL-1Î² (interleukin-1Î²), MIP-3Î± (macrophage inflammatory protein-3Î±), IL-17, and IL-8.

8fc1d380d4aa32501f5b9b2bcd4240a63cfe6c12,Inference of Gene Regulatory Networks with Sparse Structural Equation Models Exploiting Genetic Perturbations,"Integrating genetic perturbations with gene expression data not only improves accuracy of regulatory network topology inference, but also enables learning of causal regulatory relations between genes. Although a number of methods have been developed to integrate both types of data, the desiderata of efficient and powerful algorithms still remains. In this paper, sparse structural equation models (SEMs) are employed to integrate both gene expression data and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), for modeling gene regulatory networks in accordance with biological evidence about genes regulating or being regulated by a small number of genes. A systematic inference method named sparsity-aware maximum likelihood (SML) is developed for SEM estimation. Using simulated directed acyclic or cyclic networks, the SML performance is compared with that of two state-of-the-art algorithms: the adaptive Lasso (AL) based scheme, and the QTL-directed dependency graph (QDG) method. Computer simulations demonstrate that the novel SML algorithm offers significantly better performance than the AL-based and QDG algorithms across all sample sizes from 100 to 1,000, in terms of detection power and false discovery rate, in all the cases tested that include acyclic or cyclic networks of 10, 30 and 300 genes. The SML method is further applied to infer a network of 39 human genes that are related to the immune function and are chosen to have a reliable eQTL per gene. The resulting network consists of 9 genes and 13 edges. Most of the edges represent interactions reasonably expected from experimental evidence, while the remaining may just indicate the emergence of new interactions.

989c794aba98cb10d7e5695cff61cec67e4a0911,Abstract 2363: Novel CDH1 mutations in breast invasive lobular carcinoma,"Breast invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common type of breast cancer, making up approximately 10% of all invasive breast cancers. Breast ILC is characterized by loss of e-cadherin protein expression (CDH1), which is usually caused by loss of function mutations in the CDH1 gene. A subset of breast ILC cases have no identifiable CDH1 mutation, but presumably inactivate CDH1 through currently unknown mechanisms. Tumors from more than 150,000 unique patients including more than 15,000 breast cancers were examined by comprehensive genomic profiling to detect base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and genomic rearrangements in the full coding regions of up to 465 genes. Statistical significance of the disease distributions was calculated using Fisher9s exact test with false discovery rate multiple hypothesis testing correction. Of 760 breast ILC cases, 583 (76.7%) had a known loss-of-function mutation in the CDH1 gene. To identify previously unknown mutations that result in or substitute for CDH1 loss-of-function we performed statistical analysis on all mutations, in any gene, occurring more than once in the 177 ILC cases without an identifiable CDH1 mutation. The most statistically significant mutation was very near to a splice site of CDH1 (chr16:68863554 c.2296-3A>G), occurring in 7 CDH1 negative ILC cases as well as 9 other cases in cancer types that frequently harbor CDH1 mutations (7 breast, 2 gastroesophageal junction) and 1 colorectal cancer. Based on tumor-only test based zygosity modeling, this mutation is only observed as somatic and usually homozygous in the tumor. Four other positions near to splice sites of CDH1 (chr16:68844247 c.832+3A>G, chr16:68849667 c.1565+5G>A, chr16:68856133 c.1936+5G>A, chr16:68857532 c.2164+3A>C), mutated in 13 CDH1 negative ILC cases, were also statically significant, somatic, and usually homozygous. No statistically significant mutations were found in genes other than CDH1. Previously unappreciated somatic, non-canonical splice site mutations in CDH1 occur in ~10% (20/177) of breast ILC cases with no known CDH1 mutation. These mutations occur almost exclusively in tumor types known to harbor frequent CDH1 mutations and are usually homozygous in the tumor, strongly indicating that they are CDH1 loss-of-function mutations.

To identify a plasma proteomic signature that can detect OS, we used SELDI MS to perform proteomic profiling on plasma specimens from 29 OS and 20 age-matched osteochondroma (OC) patients. Nineteen statistically significant ion peaks that were differentially expressed in OS when compared with OC patients were identified (p < 0.001 and false discovery rate < 10%). Using the proteomic profiles, we constructed a multivariate 3-nearest neighbors classifier to distinguish OS from OC patients with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 80% based on external leave-one-out crossvalidation. Permutation test showed that the classification result was statistically significant (p < 0.00005). One of the proteins (m/z 11 704) in the proteomic signature was identified as serum amyloid protein A (SAA) by PMF. The higher plasma level of SAA in OS patients was further validated by Western blotting when compared to that of osteochrondroma patients and normal subjects as reference. The classifier based on this plasma proteomic signature may be useful to differentiate malignant bone cancer from benign bone tumors and for early detection of OS in high-risk individuals.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yiting Li"", ids = ""3207738""); list(name = ""Tu Anh T Dang"", ids = ""4137887""); list(name = ""Jianhe J Shen"", ids = ""3152627""); list(name = ""Laszlo Perlaky"", ids = ""5517043""); list(name = ""John E.

77d8c1058fbbeec6374e09c00042584645a32175,Assessing footprints of natural selection through PCA analysis in cattle,"Received: 2016-05-24 | Accepted: 2016-07-28 | Available online: 2017-06-20 http://dx.doi.org/10.15414/afz.2017.20.01.23-27 The aim of this study was to determine the population structure and to perform genome-wide scan of footprints of natural selection in cattle using principal component analysis. The applied statistics to identify the SNPs associated with selection pressure focused mainly on the extreme values of F ST index. In our study the alternative individual-based approach adopted in the PCAdapt R package has been used. This approach is based on the assumption that markers extremely related to the population structure are also candidates for local adaptation of the population. The genotype data of 350 animals originating from four historically or geographically connected populations (Austrian Pinzgau, Slovak Pinzgau, Brown Swiss, Tyrol Grey) have been used to test this approach in cattle. As expected based on breed's origin the principal component analysis showed the division of animals in to the 3 separate clusters and the eigenvalues suggested to use of K=3 as optimal number. The analysis of genomic regions harbouring signals revealed the candidate genes previously associated with muscle formation and immunity system. Detecting signals of adaptation that were also the targets of historical selection will allow in the future a better understanding of cattle origin.

192afc74f853d2fd11b0fa2443c235c21a8f2078,A systematic comparison of statistical methods to detect interactions in exposome-health associations,"BackgroundThere is growing interest in examining the simultaneous effects of multiple exposures and, more generally, the effects of mixtures of exposures, as part of the exposome concept (being defined as the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards). Uncovering such combined effects is challenging owing to the large number of exposures, several of them being highly correlated. We performed a simulation study in an exposome context to compare the performance of several statistical methods that have been proposed to detect statistical interactions.MethodsSimulations were based on an exposome including 237 exposures with a realistic correlation structure. We considered several statistical regression-based methods, including two-step Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS2), the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET (GLINTERNET), a three-step method based on regression trees and finally Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). We assessed the performance of each method in terms of model size, predictive ability, sensitivity and false discovery rate.ResultsGLINTERNET and DSA had better overall performance than the other methods, with GLINTERNET having better properties in terms of selecting the true predictors (sensitivity) and of predictive ability, while DSA had a lower number of false positives. In terms of ability to capture interaction terms, GLINTERNET and DSA had again the best performances, with the same trade-off between sensitivity and false discovery proportion. When GLINTERNET and DSA failed to select an exposure truly associated with the outcome, they tended to select a highly correlated one. When interactions were not present in the data, using variable selection methods that allowed for interactions had only slight costs in performance compared to methods that only searched for main effects.ConclusionsGLINTERNET and DSA provided better performance in detecting two-way interactions, compared to other existing methods.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jose Barrera-GÃ³mez"", ids = ""1401743323""); list(name = ""Lydiane Agier"", ids = ""50477938""); list(name = ""LÃ¼tzen Portengen"", ids = ""3681601""); list(name = ""Marc Chadeau-Hyam"", ids = ""1380692828""); list(name = ""Lise Giorgis-Allemand"", ids = ""1399386793""); list(name = ""ValÃ©rie Siroux"", ids = ""4475234""); list(name = ""Oliver Robinson"", ids = ""144538171""); list(name = ""Jelle Vlaanderen"", ids = ""144164836""); list(name = ""Juan JosÃ© Ramos GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""1802926""); list(name = ""Mark J Nieuwenhuijsen"", ids = ""6741164""); list(name = ""Paolo Vineis"", ids = ""2591675""); list(name = ""Martine Vrijheid"", ids = ""3658758""); list(name = ""Roel C H Vermeulen"", ids = ""144756664""); list(name = ""RÃ©my Slama"", ids = ""34893849""); list(name = ""Xavier BasagaÃ±a"", ids = ""5944461"")",799a2e47eaf83ac84c063ae247c6e4afd02a038a; 6d11ec4eebf32f05e1bcfa12de2fb51012ef35e1; be9c3b5cd0ed78f04746918e3d8b5110de2bf79e; 0ca315ae6c63d7b3601d1e8f7f84f497030c6f0d; c510a0f293fb449440eb091c5d0faee6c868a933; 68929dab8eb53f167f3fd9aa55653565360832fc; 373798ba190c80b4f1bb4915c297310e12556c27; 4efb5ee690dfbd54b8e8e36dc91bc67e208f5a05; 372a76129de608181bea22bdb37ceaa372345949,779f296ff11bf8cd37805fab8368801c7204fd3c; 5d71ec68c63f52026a28727b6677e5965bb04bb1; 5e4698cd7acb8eb17e7234e3aa617c2cbee858a3; baaaa3e20ca4ba8dae31218ae7a9382253b83b50; 02c388d43f619146ef64babb4c848190e83add1b; 4f830f55abc04c1ef832ec9f90f19f0425f71fd9; fe4eb71f3f60a417c4a95395fc1cf56dc8fee72d; 8a9b3bc63ee9d0af9d494e0a574e65c4c2f323eb; 60dad118e7cbc7df62dd8cf631efba93d01e5b52; b744f51e887f9841c049d333a84d8f0e09b43a8b; 7f89ade32cf3fcd079184fa45c6d2a13906d2c27; 48a75b84f2d314ab5a8f4e76fac2b77d44492dfc; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; ec55fde909b592f92ae85c308dff5c695c5c22ea; bca0db1f8f75891a1ec302ab0252439ef92c38ea; 26b2a185c68f55e90720276dda5337cae3953b09; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; e882e78f633a876bea4ad490181471d391d54c86; bace0cc082a2dd1ece949be7e07393b5e6bd6b9e; 86ae37eb0c2d809105471960876d9140eb8f7a50; d0653e0c29dfa6122e7aaf3520b0edd3ecc23e1e; 4ab5ebadee2ee7a4a253682ceb6e1d71ca5c2efc; 3ec729f943f530b3aa591e38c3d96c75a5261397; 0e96748051783bcc2d9bb7fa460286b46d7d80a5; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a83e529d5350e39d5b53cad4e1217317524c2bc5; 6ba9afd9241a5d04e2ce890f0a6f082d167968b8; e3456adb2403d3f478aad2144e5e317da68321b9,Environmental Health,16,

Methods Data of patients with DM, PM, or CADM who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University from February 2011 to February 2019 were retrospectively collected. Patients diagnosed with HLH constituted the case group. A 1:4 case-control study was performed to identify risk factors for HLH in patients with DM, PM, or CADM through comparison, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Intragroup comparison was made among patients with HLH to identify factors influencing unfavorable short-term outcome. Results HLH was a rare (4.2%) but fatal (77.8%) complication in patients with DM, PM, or CADM. The retrospective case-control study revealed that higher on-admission disease activity (p = 0.008), acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (AE-ILD, p = 0.002), and infection (p = 0.002) were risk factors for complication of HLH in patients with DM, PM, or CADM. The following intragroup comparison showed that higher on-admission disease activity (p = 0.035) and diagnosis of CADM (p = 0.039) might influence the short-term outcome of patients with HLH. However, no risk factor was identified after false discovery rate correction. Conclusion In this study, secondary HLH was a fatal complication, with higher on-admission disease activity, AE-ILD, and infection working as risk factors. The underlying role of infection and autoimmune abnormality in HLH in connective tissue disease was subsequently noted. Clinical factors influencing the short-term outcome of patients with secondary HLH require further study.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Junyu Liang"", ids = ""123645286""); list(name = ""Danyi Xu"", ids = ""5930440""); list(name = ""Chuanyin Sun"", ids = ""7799250""); list(name = ""Weiqian Chen"", ids = ""151492244""); list(name = ""Heng Cao"", ids = ""47709932""); list(name = ""Jin Lin"", ids = ""1405977697"")",,,The Journal of Rheumatology,,
fdced92290c9828f31ebc74bd7fc995b4c5494bb,Metabolomics signatures associated with an oral glucose challenge in pregnant women.,"AIM
The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), widely used as a gold standard for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis, provides a broad view of glucose pathophysiology in response to a glucose challenge. We conducted the present study to evaluate metabolite changes before and after an oral glucose challenge in pregnancy; and to examine the extent to which metabolites may serve to predict GDM diagnosis in pregnant women.


METHODS
Peruvian pregnant women (n=100) attending prenatal clinics (mean gestation 25 weeks) participated in the study with 23% of them having GDM diagnosis. Serum samples were collected immediately prior to and 2-hours after administration of a 75-g OGTT. Targeted metabolic profiling was performed using a LC-MS based metabolomics platform. Changes in metabolite levels were evaluated using paired Student's t-tests and the change patterns were examined at the level of pathways. Multivariate regression procedures were used to examine metabolite pairwise differences associated with subsequent GDM diagnosis.


RESULTS
Of the 306 metabolites detected, the relative concentration of 127 metabolites were statistically significantly increased or decreased 2-hours after the oral glucose load (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected P-value<0.001). We identified relative decreases in metabolites in acylcarnitines, fatty acids, and diacylglycerols while relative increases were noted among bile acids. In addition, we found that C58:10 triacylglycerol (Î²=-0.08, SE=0.04), C58:9 triacylglycerol (Î²=-0.07, SE=0.03), adenosine (Î²=0.70, SE=0.32), methionine sulfoxide (Î²=0.36, SE=0.13) were significantly associated with GDM diagnosis even after adjusting for age and body mass index.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified alterations in maternal serum metabolites, representing distinct cellular and metabolic pathways including fatty acid metabolism, in response to an oral glucose challenge.

Analytical answers to this question are derived from statistics alone and aim to fix, for example, the false discovery rate at a predetermined tolerance. These methods, however, neglect local economic context and consequently lead to irrational experimental strategies. In contrast, the authors argue that this question is essentially economic, not statistical, and is amenable to an economic analysis that admits an optimal solution. This solution, in turn, suggests a novel tool for deciding the number of hits to confirm and the marginal cost of discovery, which meaningfully quantifies the local economic trade-off between true and false positives, yielding an economically optimal experimental strategy.

2874f79c68c17e78af1750c06ba7b5d4276753f6,Responses of the Insulin Signaling Pathways in the Brown Adipose Tissue of Rats following Cold Exposure,"UNLABELLED
The insulin signaling pathway is critical for the control of blood glucose levels. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has also been implicated as important in glucose homeostasis. The effect of short-term cold exposure on this pathway in BAT has not been explored. We evaluated the effect of 4 hours of cold exposure on the insulin pathway in the BAT of rats. Whole genomic microarray chips were used to examine the transcripts of the pathway in BAT of rats exposed to 4Â°C and 22Â°C for 4 hours. The 4 most significantly altered pathways following 4 hours of cold exposure were the insulin signaling pathway, protein kinase A, PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling. The insulin signaling pathway was the most affected. In the documented 142 genes of the insulin pathway, 42 transcripts (29.6%) responded significantly to this cold exposure with the least false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg Multiple Testing: -log10 (p-value) â€Š= 7.18). Twenty-seven genes (64%) were up-regulated, including the insulin receptor (Insr), insulin substrates 1 and 2 (Irs1 and Irs2). Fifteen transcripts (36%) were down-regulated. Multiple transcripts of the primary target and secondary effector targets for the insulin signaling were also up-regulated, including those for carbohydrate metabolism. Using western blotting, we demonstrated that the cold induced higher Irs2, Irs1, and Akt-p protein levels in the BAT than in the BAT of controls maintained at room temperature, and higher Akt-p protein level in the muscle.


CONCLUSION
this study demonstrated that 4 hours of cold exposure stimulated the insulin signaling pathway in the BAT and muscle of overnight fasted rats. This raises the possibility that acute cold stimulation may have potential to improve glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiaofei Wang"", ids = ""47118934""); list(name = ""Richard W.

0548892affb3e3ec14291287bc9daf5b87273432,Ontogeny-related pharmacogene changes in the pediatric liver transcriptome,"Objectives The majority of drug dosing studies are based on adult populations, with modification of the dosing for children based on size and weight. This rudimentary approach for drug dosing children is limited, as biologically a child can differ from an adult in far more aspects than just size and weight. Specifically, understanding the ontogeny of childhood liver development is critical in dosing drugs that are metabolized through the liver, as the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drugâ€™s pharmacologic action. Therefore, we set out to determine pharmacogenes that change over childhood development, followed by a secondary agnostic analysis, assessing changes transcriptome wide. Materials and methods A total of 47 human liver tissue samples, with between 10 and 13 samples in four age groups spanning childhood development, underwent pair-end sequencing. Kruskalâ€“Wallis and Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation tests were used to determine the association of gene expression levels with age. Gene set analysis based on the pathways in KEGG utilized the gamma method. Correction for multiple testing was completed using q-values. Results We found evidence for increased expression of â€˜very important pharmacogenesâ€™, for example, coagulation factor V (F5) (P=6.7Ã—10âˆ’7), angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) (P=6.4Ã—10âˆ’3), and solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1) (P=7.0Ã—10âˆ’5) over childhood development. In contrast, we observed a significant decrease in expression of two alternative CYP3A7 transcripts (P=1.5Ã—10âˆ’5 and 3.0Ã—10âˆ’5) over development. The analysis of genome-wide changes detected transcripts in the following genes with significant changes in mRNA expression (P<1Ã—10âˆ’9 with false discovery rate<5Ã—0âˆ’5): ADCY1, PTPRD, CNDP1, DCAF12L1 and HIP1. Gene set analysis determined ontogeny-related transcriptomic changes in the reninâ€“angiotensin pathway (P<0.002), with lower expression of the pathway, in general, observed in liver samples from younger participants. Conclusion Considering that the reninâ€“angiotensin pathway plays a central role in blood pressure and plasma sodium concentration, and our observation that ACE and PTPRD expression increased over the spectrum of childhood development, this finding could potentially impact the dosing of an entire class of drugs known as ACE-inhibitors in pediatric patients.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard Meier"", ids = ""40524033""); list(name = ""Chengpeng Bi"", ids = ""40026284""); list(name = ""Roger Gaedigk"", ids = ""2267388""); list(name = ""Daniel P Heruth"", ids = ""3609337""); list(name = ""Shui Qing Ye"", ids = ""1910198""); list(name = ""J.

The goal of this study was to identify potential transcriptomic markers in developing pediatric sepsis by a co-expression module analysis of the transcriptomic dataset.MethodsUsing the R software and Bioconductor packages, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify co-expression modules significantly associated with pediatric sepsis. Functional interpretation (gene ontology and pathway analysis) and enrichment analysis with known transcription factors and microRNAs of the identified candidate modules were then performed. In modules significantly associated with sepsis, the intramodular analysis was further performed and â€œhub genesâ€ were identified and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in this study.Results15 co-expression modules in total were detected, and four modules (â€œmidnight blueâ€, â€œcyanâ€, â€œbrownâ€, and â€œtanâ€) were most significantly associated with pediatric sepsis and suggested as potential sepsis-associated modules. Gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis revealed that these four modules strongly associated with immune response. Three of the four sepsis-associated modules were also enriched with known transcription factors (false discovery rate-adjusted PÂ <Â 0.05). Hub genes were identified in each of the four modules. Four of the identified hub genes (MYB proto-oncogene like 1, killer cell lectin like receptor G1, stomatin, and membrane spanning 4-domains A4A) were further validated to be differentially expressed between septic children and controls by qPCR.ConclusionsFour pediatric sepsis-associated co-expression modules were identified in this study. qPCR results suggest that hub genes in these modules are potential transcriptomic markers for pediatric sepsis diagnosis.

c10cc2e9fd3a91fd56219f2ca66c2950a03b88d5,DNA repair variants and breast cancer risk.,"A functional DNA repair system has been identified as important in the prevention of tumour development. Previous studies have hypothesized that common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play a role in breast cancer risk and also identified the potential for interactions between these polymorphisms and established breast cancer risk factors such as physical activity. Associations with breast cancer risk for 99 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genes in ten DNA repair pathways were examined in a case-control study including both Europeans (644 cases, 809 controls) and East Asians (299 cases, 160 controls). Odds ratios in both additive and dominant genetic models were calculated separately for participants of European and East Asian ancestry using multivariate logistic regression. The impact of multiple comparisons was assessed by correcting for the false discovery rate within each DNA repair pathway. Interactions between several breast cancer risk factors and DNA repair SNPs were also evaluated. One SNP (rs3213282) in the gene XRCC1 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in the dominant model of inheritance following adjustment for the false discovery rate (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), although no associations were observed for other DNA repair SNPs. Interactions of six SNPs in multiple DNA repair pathways with physical activity were evident prior to correction for FDR, following which there was support for only one of the interaction terms (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). No consistent associations between variants in DNA repair genes and breast cancer risk or their modification by breast cancer risk factors were observed.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anne Grundy"", ids = ""4380036""); list(name = ""Harriet Richardson"", ids = ""145237868""); list(name = ""Johanna M.

a7ee245241648dc5449ea4e8978cbae585aab04c,An extended data mining method for identifying differentially expressed assay-specific signatures in functional genomic studies,"BackgroundMicroarray data sets provide relative expression levels for thousands of genes for a small number, in comparison, of different experimental conditions called assays. Data mining techniques are used to extract specific information of genes as they relate to the assays. The multivariate statistical technique of principal component analysis (PCA) has proven useful in providing effective data mining methods. This article extends the PCA approach of Rollins et al. to the development of ranking genes of microarray data sets that express most differently between two biologically different grouping of assays. This method is evaluated on real and simulated data and compared to a current approach on the basis of false discovery rate (FDR) and statistical power (SP) which is the ability to correctly identify important genes.ResultsThis work developed and evaluated two new test statistics based on PCA and compared them to a popular method that is not PCA based. Both test statistics were found to be effective as evaluated in three case studies: (i) exposing E. coli cells to two different ethanol levels; (ii) application of myostatin to two groups of mice; and (iii) a simulated data study derived from the properties of (ii). The proposed method (PM) effectively identified critical genes in these studies based on comparison with the current method (CM). The simulation study supports higher identification accuracy for PM over CM for both proposed test statistics when the gene variance is constant and for one of the test statistics when the gene variance is non-constant.ConclusionsPM compares quite favorably to CM in terms of lower FDR and much higher SP. Thus, PM can be quite effective in producing accurate signatures from large microarray data sets for differential expression between assays groups identified in a preliminary step of the PCA procedure and is, therefore, recommended for use in these applications.",2010,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Derrick K.

ff353d02c3bb1cba9d53f6e4466cc9ef2a6a3d52,Controlling FDR while highlighting distinct discoveries,"Often modern scientific investigations start by testing a very large number of hypotheses in an effort to comprehensively mine the data for possible discoveries. Multiplicity adjustment strategies are employed to ensure replicability of the results of this broad search. Furthermore, in many cases, discoveries are subject to a second round of filtering, where researchers select the rejected hypotheses that better represent distinct and interpretable findings for reporting and follow-up. For example, in genetic studies, one DNA variant is often chosen to represent a group of neighboring polymorphisms, all apparently associated to a trait of interest. Unfortunately the guarantees of false discovery rate (FDR) control that might be true for the initial set of findings do not translate to this second filtered set. Indeed we observe that some filters used in practice have a tendency of keeping a larger fraction of nulls than non-nulls, thereby inflating the FDR. To overcome this, we introduce Focused BH, a multiple testing procedure that accounts for the filtering step, allowing the researcher to rely on the data and on the results of testing to filter the rejection set, while assuring FDR control under a range of assumptions on the filter and the p-value dependency structure. Simulations illustrate that FDR control on the filtered set of discoveries is obtained without substantial power loss and that the procedure is robust to violations of our theoretical assumptions. Notable applications of Focused BH include control of the outer node FDR when testing hypotheses on a tree.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Eugene Katsevich"", ids = ""14144300""); list(name = ""Chiara Sabatti"", ids = ""2139035""); list(name = ""M.

20bbbdf7482b1dee4d50b842ac1d31687ac3a38c,A Comparison of Anthropometric Measures with Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis in the Classification of Overweight and Obesity in U.S. Military Personnel (P21-050-19).,"Objectives
Given that the prevalence of obesity in the military is a growing national security concern, we sought to determine: 1) the level of agreement between body mass index (BMI), circumference-based equation (CBE), waist circumference (WC), and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures, and 2) if BMI, CBE, or WC measures alone or in combination adequately reflect adiposity in military personnel compared to BIA measures.


Methods
Measurements taken by trained personnel were used to estimate BMI (using overweight cut-offs in males from the military (BMI, â‰¥27.5 kg/m2) and World Health Organization (WHO BMI, â‰¥25.0 kg/m2)), BMI % body fat (BF%), WC, CBE BF%, and BIA BF%. Respondents were categorized as normal vs. overweight/obese or overfat. Anthropometric measures were compared to BIA to examine levels of agreement and standard screening performance measures.


Results
Among the 389 participants (78% male), WHO BMI and BIA BF% classified the most males (61.1% and 42.6%, respectively) and females (both 51.2%) as overweight/obese, whereas WC with BMI (BMIÂ +Â WC) and WC alone were the least likely to classify males (10.9% and 11.6%, respectively) and females (both 9.3%) as overweight/obese. The levels of agreement were all statistically significant and highest for BMI (males Cohen's kappa (Ck)Â =Â 0.711, females CkÂ =Â 0.814) and WHO BMI (males CkÂ =Â 0.578, females CkÂ =Â 0.814); moderate for BMIÂ +Â CBE (males CkÂ =Â 0.447, females CkÂ =Â 0.676); and lowest for WC and WCÂ +Â BMI (all CkÂ â‰¤Â 0.270). To maximize sensitivity and minimize false discovery rate, BMIÂ +Â CBE performed best overall (sensitivityÂ =Â 50.9%, false discovery rateÂ =Â 5.4%).


Conclusions
Valid measures of adiposity are needed to ensure that military recruitment and job security are not jeopardized by inaccurate body fat standards. Our findings support BMIÂ +Â CBE as an easy-to-implement combination to assess adiposity in the military. Future studies need to consider overall goals, including associated health risks, before expanding on these findings.

612d007e857b59992d29a5e07e690a1cad1195c0,Genetic variant in DNA repair gene GTF2H4 is associated with lung cancer risk: a large-scale analysis of six published GWAS datasets in the TRICL consortium.,"DNA repair pathways maintain genomic integrity and stability, and dysfunction of DNA repair leads to cancer. We hypothesize that functional genetic variants in DNA repair genes are associated with risk of lung cancer. We performed a large-scale meta-analysis of 123,371 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 169 DNA repair genes obtained from six previously published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 12160 lung cancer cases and 16838 controls. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the logistic regression model and used the false discovery rate (FDR) method for correction of multiple testing. As a result, 14 SNPs had a significant odds ratio (OR) for lung cancer risk with P FDR < 0.05, of which rs3115672 in MSH5 (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.14-1.27) and rs114596632 in GTF2H4 (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.12-1.25) at 6q21.33 were the most statistically significant (P combined = 3.99Ã—10(-11) and P combined = 5.40Ã—10(-10), respectively). The MSH5 rs3115672, but not GTF2H4 rs114596632, was strongly correlated with MSH5 rs3131379 in that region (r (2) = 1.000 and r (2) = 0.539, respectively) as reported in a previous GWAS. Importantly, however, the GTF2H4 rs114596632 T, but not MSH5 rs3115672 T, allele was significantly associated with both decreased DNA repair capacity phenotype and decreased mRNA expression levels. These provided evidence that functional genetic variants of GTF2H4 confer susceptibility to lung cancer.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meilin Wang"", ids = ""48958490""); list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Zhensheng Liu"", ids = ""9071783""); list(name = ""Xiaohua Yi"", ids = ""47162905""); list(name = ""Heike Bickeboller"", ids = ""152498128""); list(name = ""Rayjean J.

5a43014fa768ccec9a1dfa3244033c328c0991e2,Selenium Deficiency-Induced Pancreatic Pathology Is Associated with Oxidative Stress and Energy Metabolism Disequilibrium,"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in development and physiological processes. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Se deficiency on pancreatic pathology and the potential mechanism in pigs. Twenty-four castrated male Yorkshire pigs were divided into two groups and fed a Se-deficient diet (0.007 mg Se/kg) or a Se-adequate diet (0.3 mg Se/kg) for 16 weeks. The serum concentrations of insulin and glucagon, Se concentration, histologic characteristics, apoptotic status, antioxidant activity, free radical content, and major metabolite concentrations were analyzed. The results showed that Se deficiency reduced the concentrations of insulin and glucagon in the serum and of Se in pancreas, decreased the number of islets and cells in the local islets, and induced pancreatic apoptosis. Se deficiency caused a redox imbalance, which led to an increase in the content of free radicals and decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Of 147 targeted metabolites judged to be present in pancreas, only hypotaurine and D-glucuronic acid had differential concentrations with the false discovery rate <â€‰0.05. Pathway analysis using metabolites with differential expression (unadjusted Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, fold change >â€‰1.4 or <â€‰0.67) found that 8 glycolytic metabolites were significantly increased by Se-deficient, whereas most of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway metabolites were not significantly changed. Our studies indicated that Se deficiency-induced pancreatic pathology was associated with oxidative stress and enhanced activity of glycolysis, which may provide gaining insight into the actions of Se as a diabetogenic factor.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shuang Li"", ids = ""47319568""); list(name = ""Qingyu Zhao"", ids = ""2770206""); list(name = ""Kai Zhang"", ids = ""1500453479""); list(name = ""Wenjuan Sun"", ids = ""49934879""); list(name = ""Jialiang Li"", ids = ""49298424""); list(name = ""Xiaoqing Guo"", ids = ""46910176""); list(name = ""Jing-dong Yin"", ids = ""35120725""); list(name = ""Junmin Zhang"", ids = ""40539636""); list(name = ""Chaohua Tang"", ids = ""10240037"")",,ec0cdf960d6c00abed70b0b3a2f13890f66a683a; 0c9de4aa510659b520cd4c944ee3fb7acda91558; dd35316b4f4f5a6ed46402ac8dcdf59aef7fcf41; 3e88181ef4fd77a9af1683e7dd519089b0b34b00; f36d7f6ff27c648b4119d592ba60b5b201b9e131; e7a5ee872237ac5ff25c5f375f805d305e0d3780; b3e5e1aa33203f665d87c44ccfc137a4ef609242; aa7a133a1ab51bca5252eaa55eb3592ad814420f; bd1e2667f343dc4d2c48ccab8b8354f284fb54b8; a09333534f233aa47c21d43c30baee9454bb2e93; 8e952d507c70be3dc22ddae3a6ceb9f70be21f2b; de3190fdbec48f7896927569b884f0405a2da61c; b51871d213ef5fe53820fd3d900f98f6fe18738e; 6c3c8ffa27f1813f86c47e8e4a87b54424ad914a; dae2df0871e51ee8793fd2d3f4668cc3cdece503; 49ff2f4976dc24682f5a2f351a9d80a7f1ad6a27; ee389cb4f3fc0cbbb9ce299f0085823f8a4c1197; 3000029d48fd9549c2394ca5dc34dd4ae1f0db77; 9c38dd535282aa4c737138246b0c46068998bccc; 4bdae7e8af78f182757013ab71cfd7e867f2cbde; f479839bca45f45bb98cb8d319a91cc1ba37ad42; fa9a790a18fff58b6cd26a90d88754f026c657c0; e1f80d4f6627e17f17afbac9ccdba102ac96997b; 2cc82245de55261285649062b5445e8bc18ae7e2; 1cb04d30f148007588ed7ad95a7828a6b40fda8c; 83247f6452a2c2312c05b27c8759ecbbca4e64a0; c235538e0a902f17b4b1618ce4c9b2fe2243d9fc; fa65718229d4c135c90901fc8c17372143b21454; 74e9ee8f47504e37b949eed833d79a9346932912; 0218f3cead5d69f25398f6ec2475901ae9b02874; e4390afb9f53a45ed0ed9a769a26d7ee1c26f3bf; ede2c444cb34cc20660860d00368b62b51ca3f4a; f3dbe946f2d6f77e570e10a07518868b34d3b67c; 0ad30d98955593c747b063bf21b33529b0fc5431; 41d641928f44c3a7a95cef8ebcad31a8023b68e6; 750cece162a7616b1616d61d86edb79f85a9af31; a67868cc1bc5bcfaba70438e6fe99a5a583321c6; 6d5d38b287b5dc7ba625f657e7f8104c99183ada; 8287b79f8dba1a35780344448703743ced54a2e0; 4e8a69faf74dee2f5a33413942bcc3d79975ea51; 05a6b174fc71671c868318c9dde4f6c27bd25d4c; d3d3576b18aa50afc975a5385e55d07a37d7efeb; c507da3f0d51bee9b96177c833daf0303aaa7ca7; 328cbc7d646d72735b8ad03cc9ad6d528ff38cf7; 67f72de86cfa0d5029f4b1d5715964087c2df487; 2c8db50902c1f649f7ec8dc767957b571b403246; 28977de4d74d218c546793e8fe9ea72ff48dd994; c02aaa72328a5310925f9d50edd446f6284220ae; 8db8ed5c7a770fe7e8f3beca54a59f36fb97d444; 6d3c95a98fae5b1eded965140d3262bbff5ce26c; eeb2f934b76c057a47a660e14446e661031151bc; 1ca8aa02c956d2dfa12d79369905a12c36acb310; 4a1b6bae9c4ad73820a2fe2ff5a58962ddf9ac9a; 2d159699b43a9ad3768b7b49ddf16c821108ce65; 9318d2ab706e163dab91809f93a5bdb87b4eea88; ba46e7f222d80e6d43ce20ee42813a97906a6eb2; b619127575e56b98323125095bfbb98f894f63f9; 9957ef733583126302efc62d8f9191e79192a76d; 9d92b06d37351c130196af0e668e9dd4468a259f; a3390332f84079faed92f87646f3a2fa04303d8b; cf97ed553f419f4125a8a6f778e368328eba31c2,Biological Trace Element Research,,1 - 12
7fa02ea2e652829487e170d80ff200186bdc7261,Identification of novel common variants associated with chronic pain using conditional false discovery rate analysis with major depressive disorder and assessment of pleiotropic effects of LRFN5,"Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide, with a significant socioeconomic burden, and also contributes to excess mortality. Chronic pain is a complex trait that is moderately heritable and genetically, as well as phenotypically, correlated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Use of the Conditional False Discovery Rate (cFDR) approach, which leverages pleiotropy identified from existing GWAS outputs, has been successful in discovering novel associated variants in related phenotypes. Here, genome-wide association study outputs for both von Korff chronic pain grade as a quasi-quantitative trait and for MDD were used to identify variants meeting a cFDR threshold for each outcome phenotype separately, as well as a conjunctional cFDR (ccFDR) threshold for both phenotypes together. Using a moderately conservative threshold, we identified a total of 11 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six of which were associated with chronic pain grade and nine of which were associated with MDD. Four SNPs on chromosome 14 were associated with both chronic pain grade and MDD. SNPs associated only with chronic pain grade were located within SLC16A7 on chromosome 12. SNPs associated only with MDD were located either in a gene-dense region on chromosome 1 harbouring LINC01360, LRRIQ3, FPGT and FPGT-TNNI3K, or within/close to LRFN5 on chromosome 14. The SNPs associated with both outcomes were also located within LRFN5. Several of the SNPs on chromosomes 1 and 14 were identified as being associated with expression levels of nearby genes in the brain and central nervous system. Overall, using the cFDR approach, we identified several novel genetic loci associated with chronic pain and we describe likely pleiotropic effects of a recently identified MDD locus on chronic pain. Author Summary Genetic variants explaining variation in complex traits can often be associated with more than one trait at once (â€˜pleiotropyâ€™). Taking account of this pleiotropy in genetic studies can increase power to find sites in the genome harbouring trait-associated variants. In this study we used the suspected underlying pleiotropy between chronic pain and major depressive disorder to discover novel variants associated with chronic pain, and to investigate genetic variation that may be shared between the two disorders.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Keira J A Johnston"", ids = ""40004644""); list(name = ""Mark James Adams"", ids = ""35161645""); list(name = ""Barbara I.

However, the presence and the extent of genotype-specific variations in gene regulation are largely unknown. Here, we report results of a comprehensive analysis of expression regulation of genetic variation related to 11,672 complex disease-associated SNPs as a function of sex and age in whole-blood-derived RNA from 5254 individuals. At false discovery rate <0.05, we identified 14 sex- and 10 age-interacting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We show that these eQTLs are also associated with many sex- or age-associated traits.

5f81dadae834e8d107f0406044760c88e95cdc00,Affecting Muscularity of the Myostatin Mutant ( MstnCmpt-dl 1 Abc ) Compact Mouse,"The hypermuscular Compact phenotype was first noted in a line of mice selected for high body weight and protein content. A new line, based on mice showing the Compact phenotype, was formed and selected for maximum expression of the Compact phenotype. Previously we mapped and identified a 12-bp deletion in the myostatin gene, denoted Mstn, which can be considered as a major gene responsible for the hypermuscular phenotype. Genetic analysis revealed that full expression of the hypermuscular phenotype requires the action of modifier loci in addition to Mstn. To map these modifier loci, an interspecific F2 population was generated between Comp9, an inbred line homozygous for Mstn, and CAST/Ei, an inbred line generated from Mus musculus castaneus. Selective DNA pooling and genotyping, separately by gender, was carried out within a subpopulation of the F2 consisting of individuals homozygous for Mstn. Significant association with hypermuscularity at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was found for markers on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 11, 16, and X. In all cases, the marker allele derived from the Comp9 parent showed a higher frequency in the hypermuscular group and the CAST/Ei allele in the normal group. The modifier loci apparently exerted their effects on muscularity only in the presence of Mstn. THE Compact â€œhypermuscularâ€ mutation arose durregion of Mstn and shown to be responsible for the double-muscled phenotype in these breeds (Grobet et ing a selection experiment in Germany (Bunger et al. 2001). A â€œCompactâ€ subline was formed and selected al. 1997; Kambadur et al. 1997; McPherron and Lee 1997). MstnCmpt-dl1Abc, however, was found in the propepfor maximum hypermuscularity. Genetic analysis of the tide region of the myostatin precursor (SzabÃ³ et al. Compact line indicated that a major gene, denoted 1998). In analogy with TGF1, we hypothesized that Cmpt, and one or more modifier genes were involved the propeptide region might play an important role in in determining the degree of expression of the Compact the proper folding, efficient secretion, processing, or phenotype. The putative major gene (Cmpt) was mapped targeting of the mature growth factor domain of myoto an 8.2-cM region on mouse chromosome 1 (Varga statin. Although some of these steps may be seriously et al. 1997). After the discovery of the myostatin gene impaired by the MstnCmpt-dl1Abc mutation, the activity of ma(McPherron et al. 1997), we identified the MstnCmpt-dl1Abc ture myostatin is not zero in homozygous Cmpt/Cmpt deletion in the propeptide region of the gene and mapped mutants. Modifier genes may therefore have a significant the mouse myostatin gene to a point 27.7 cM from the influence on the phenotype (SzabÃ³ et al. 1998). centromere on chromosome 1 (SzabÃ³ et al. 1998). In the current study we report the mapping of modifier Myostatin, belonging to the transforming growth difloci affecting the expression of the hypermuscularity in ferentiation factor(TGF) superfamily, is a negative the Compact mouse. Our basic assumption is that due regulator of muscle growth. Myostatin was first identito selection for hypermuscularity, the Compact line, in fied when null-mutant knockout mice exhibited a large addition to achieving homozygosity for the MstnCmpt-dl1Abc and widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass due to mutation, also accumulated modifier alleles that inan increase of muscle fiber number (hyperplasia) and creased the expression of hypermuscularity in the Comthickness (hypertrophy; McPherron et al. 1997).

c8cd41cf15799dfbf1c1a0f5cba62dce92982aff,Motor and Nonmotor Circuitry Activation Induced by Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation in Patients With Parkinson Disease: Intraoperative Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Deep Brain Stimulation.,"OBJECTIVE
To test the hypothesis suggested by previous studies that subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson disease would affect the activity of motor and nonmotor networks, we applied intraoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to patients receiving DBS.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Ten patients receiving STN DBS for Parkinson disease underwent intraoperative 1.5-T fMRI during high-frequency stimulation delivered via an external pulse generator. The study was conducted between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2014.


RESULTS
We observed blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes (false discovery rate <0.001) in the motor circuitry (including the primary motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortices; thalamus; pedunculopontine nucleus; and cerebellum) and in the limbic circuitry (including the cingulate and insular cortices). Activation of the motor network was observed also after applying a Bonferroni correction (P<.001) to the data set, suggesting that across patients, BOLD changes in the motor circuitry are more consistent compared with those occurring in the nonmotor network.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the modulatory role of STN DBS on the activity of motor and nonmotor networks and suggest complex mechanisms as the basis of the efficacy of this treatment modality. Furthermore, these results suggest that across patients, BOLD changes in the motor circuitry are more consistent than those in the nonmotor network. With further studies combining the use of real-time intraoperative fMRI with clinical outcomes in patients treated with DBS, functional imaging techniques have the potential not only to elucidate the mechanisms of DBS functioning but also to guide and assist in the surgical treatment of patients affected by movement and neuropsychiatric disorders.

54c8821d07ee83d457bb0f9e06f12cbb5a5e99fd,Can variability in the effect of opioids on refractory breathlessness be explained by genetic factors?,"OBJECTIVES
Opioids modulate the perception of breathlessness with a considerable variation in response, with poor correlation between the required opioid dose and symptom severity. The objective of this hypothesis-generating, secondary analysis was to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from those associated with opioid receptors, signalling or pain modulation to identify any related to intensity of breathlessness while on opioids. This can help to inform prospective studies and potentially lead to better tailoring of opioid therapy for refractory breathlessness.


SETTING
17 hospice/palliative care services (tertiary services) in 11 European countries.


PARTICIPANTS
2294 people over 18â€…years of age on regular opioids for pain related to cancer or its treatment.


PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES
The relationship between morphine dose, breathlessness intensity (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; EORTCQLQC30 question 8) and 112 candidate SNPs from 25 genes (n=588).


SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES
The same measures for people on oxycodone (n=402) or fentanyl (n=429).


RESULTS
SNPs not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with allele frequencies (<5%) were removed. Univariate associations between each SNP and breathlessness intensity were determined with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate set at 20%. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression, clustering over country and adjusting for available confounders, was conducted with remaining SNPs. For univariate morphine associations, 1 variant on the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3B (HTR3B) gene, and 4 on the Î²-2-arrestin gene (ARRB2) were associated with more intense breathlessness. 1 SNP remained significant in the multivariable model: people with rs7103572 SNP (HTR3B gene; present in 8.4% of the population) were three times more likely to have more intense breathlessness (OR 2.86; 95% CIs 1.46 to 5.62; p=0.002). No associations were seen with fentanyl nor with oxycodone.


CONCLUSIONS

2c34e27fb96ff552d96f45ce3a8cbf62b5bb84bf,A simple method for assessing sample sizes in microarray experiments,"BackgroundIn this short article, we discuss a simple method for assessing sample size requirements in microarray experiments.ResultsOur method starts with the output from a permutation-based analysis for a set of pilot data, e.g. from the SAM package. Then for a given hypothesized mean difference and various samples sizes, we estimate the false discovery rate and false negative rate of a list of genes; these are also interpretable as per gene power and type I error. We also discuss application of our method to other kinds of response variables, for example survival outcomes.ConclusionOur method seems to be useful for sample size assessment in microarray experiments.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Tibshirani"", ids = ""1761784"")",8340a300e16449b66c87068ffae899c7b6a79814; 7ee31d3337ef0cd7eb52e1110c6f663813e10b89; 51c77c289835aa2c5b90e30b4968ccfa33391bf7; 64c4aa09819a0a763c402d49db903006c5dc4568; acfe86eae14fc7287ea61e90ebe2940a6240e75e; 5d1bc12f23a26da7ff5743662f5bf28ee1860203; 3faaefced4475838e527739bc5181c49f51b30cd; cfed350eee1b90f807156f5037a82d7d6a11be94; ace87d60416c158724edb8f0eea8bdf45878a26a; 29aaf44a36d1f676868d56f2372872ccdca76db5; 5b3a5f9c6eb58895e889cd4b53c20970234ef71e; 18cee8dc96c1f6db3e83297f3f4075e1d9fd64d7; 9c9561d5fab2f27aa9cb0d535cafdc69cee17806; 3ff7f083cee6d105cca9d1c7c9daf392a6cfd234; b57b4eadc71f736e552165b78145bc6cdbbfcf01; 4f7c552f54cd7c5ce22ab8ebd4d8b5084a046f54; a859c06802a475d86c1ab3839711206b61972d8d; 6bb400c58d01d3ba05e4327c3cc060da93f28624; 8643051b74f6b9912cb0e985352a70084f5523b3; f05a4e5c6b6144774589267134cb946047a73127; 032e8a50220afdcf45800027aaba5c21dbce53db; f967ba69095a22684327b459f811c12dbdb5f527; 24e6ab001a17f92644986a15aae6f764c8752ad5; a1b8d8093140b3e4e23d58a2ce53385aee475fdf; a54a133562ca25a8955711f9292c2eedbeefb6c6; 312a90f4e054c981487504938c5e74b347a17ec2; dffb70e521816cb9ae4e6da280b21ed56fb94765; efae90135f17e68995a1694229cf707e3c930080; c2db3167ab802d1258f3f554eb5de22a8b416b82; 79fed1b1de75942ed4f3499ed01af1770f9c9539; 9d2e89bf8f04a50632eec269966dcf53a1fee8b8; 2c7bc877184194406c757971ea12c602ccd7cf32; 96c646cfd73c54a270bbc43cacca897ba29dde58; 7f18252a47df86baeabd3cdce465cc69303b5614; f50880f8f7a0b121301dd7de17e75333bf2778ef; 714098d7a4d592b50ea6825e205263ec16ad49fd; 4582ee4a0d6614c9e6b767770c89722484d39598; dd6082ca47ca908193574c99c1be67ba3ce02764; 7d5fee23c79fc2314288caf743db954a0dd97041; 7d0e7cd40663472c29cdebfb39bb8736cbada05f; e53aafbb4e4afced925f68ae95d1702a160ee11c; 2fae44021997624c09c023d7da4e44b9eb483492; ef8b59845865c7d03414667a53adcccc15666a78; 6b2ccefd1d1a5d2c813c36467196b779f8da735c; 16b89e85fe27fb03d22c15338f82cc82a3d9fa73; e1114f881d2f84b1b0d787a66ea654a5bfd80d4a; 2185aebf5311b6982c88b6322fb3f04bf8d864c3; a16af8d5d3f8ac629eb965f52d88670665b6c6b5; 25d29584d58f0db0346a6e643f5fc5ec08cfd3a2; 330e6db61265c6cd0772040e551d9b0c53cd4574; 02948e22f852684a308de50f92478c4973f3a0d2; 60a2d827591de69258a47fc7849bd8d60f20eb17; ca301418460c62aaf50f83bf61e1e2bf08bda21e; 51543fb6088e4f5d621e28c0dea9c3efaf52ed49; 24625af64895094edce1dbbbb265e6ef322bdec1; 77108d80e6c98ede82ffcb83a8b2daf315e1d696; 7cd24362f8bea0e9633699b51ea7032cc5a4c05c; bd8fd9c6beefb1c0cdf9891fd7393ea25edd7928; e7c66707161e737a09e2a6746946a129872aadb3; 5b5b611084e949fc242deb18cfe1a7720defa9dd; 25877d5ccf2161fdf855e36c1b15c77a6186826d; a1a5280cbe420bd6590036b4b4777e589ce92345; ca2aa8fef2a19a6699fc2f68d21cf12a8fc710cc; 77c3fe957829d94c98726f3b12a87099f5cf5b3c; 2c38bf08fd96af024e457820e5f45459b1cf0d7e; d0b34080f1dd0dcadc8f1d6d311ef8fdc5d23042; 5e475e9c1345bbd5c289f4a0f3ddb27a15a10864,aef517069bde240abffad073cce4e7d46a2cee02; 78b6e56c921a073f040e8c522261b1b3370fb48c; 062d6b9d2c9ccb0593875a7bca55632854a1b08c; d62a394db31665005df761959f6f56b06048c6aa; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22,BMC Bioinformatics,7,106 - 106

2759387d3414698841d490eae0a2e22d42deb611,Association mapping in Salix viminalis L. (Salicaceae) â€“ identification of candidate genes associated with growth and phenology,"Willow species (Salix) are important as short-rotation biomass crops for bioenergy, which creates a demand for faster genetic improvement and breeding through deployment of molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). To find markers associated with important adaptive traits, such as growth and phenology, for use in MAS, we genetically dissected the trait variation of a Salix viminalis (L.) population of 323 accessions. The accessions were sampled throughout northern Europe and were established at two field sites in PustnÃ¤s, Sweden, and at Woburn, UK, offering the opportunity to assess the impact of genotype-by-environment interactions (GÂ Ã—Â E) on trait-marker associations. Field measurements were recorded for growth and phenology traits. The accessions were genotyped using 1536 SNP markers developed from phenology candidate genes and from genes previously observed to be differentially expressed in contrasting environments. Association mapping between 1233 of these SNPs and the measured traits was performed taking into account population structure and threshold selection bias. At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2, 29 SNPs were associated with bud burst, leaf senescence, number of shoots or shoot diameter. The percentage of accession variation (Radj2) explained by these associations ranged from 0.3% to 4.4%, suggesting that the studied traits are controlled by many loci of limited individual impact. Despite this, a SNP in the EARLY FLOWERING 3 gene was repeatedly associated (FDRÂ <Â 0.2) with bud burst. The rare homozygous genotype exhibited 0.4-1.0 lower bud burst scores than the other genotype classes on a five-grade scale. Consequently, this marker could be promising for use in MAS and the gene deserves further study. Otherwise, associations were less consistent across sites, likely due to their small Radj2 estimates and to considerable GÂ Ã—Â E interactions indicated by multivariate association analyses and modest trait accession correlations across sites (0.32-0.61).",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Henrik R HallingbÃ¤ck"", ids = ""4009062""); list(name = ""Johan Fogelqvist"", ids = ""4950713""); list(name = ""Stephen J.

7078a504597c8ff3d88946099ec5849d5777f62a,Profiling and Validation of the Circular RNA Repertoire in Adult Murine Hearts,"For several decades, cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death throughout all countries. There is a strong genetic component to many disease subtypes (e.g., cardiomyopathy) and we are just beginning to understand the relevant genetic factors. Several studies have related RNA splicing to cardiovascular disease and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an emerging player. circRNAs, which originate through back-splicing events from primary transcripts, are resistant to exonucleases and typically not polyadenylated. Initial functional studies show clear phenotypic outcomes for selected circRNAs. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive catalogue of RNase R-resistant circRNA species for the adult murine heart. This work combines state-of-the-art circle sequencing with our novel DCC software to explore the circRNA landscape of heart tissue. Overall, we identified 575 circRNA species that pass a beta-binomial test for enrichment (false discovery rate of 1%) in the exonuclease-treated sequencing sample. Several circRNAs can be directly attributed to host genes that have been previously described as associated with cardiovascular disease. Further studies of these candidate circRNAs may reveal disease-relevant properties or functions of specific circRNAs.",2016,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tobias Jakobi"", ids = ""31697564""); list(name = ""Lisa F.

8e60974efa199d7bb0f1c69b6596501222cf942c,Increased gene expression of histone deacetylases in patients with Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms,"Abstract 4119 Introduction: Several new treatment strategies within the Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms CMPNs are beeing explored, among these, agents belonging to the class of HDAC-inhibitors, including givinostat (ITF2357) and vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)). These agents are inhibitors of class I and II HDAC enzymes, promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. Recently, enhanced histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme activity has been found in CD34+ cells from patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), enzyme activity levels highly exceeding those recorded in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). The raised levels correlated to the degree of splenomegaly, suggesting that HDAC might be recruited as ET or PV progresses into myelofibrosis or PMF progresses into a more advanced stage. In order to further describe HDACs in CMPNs, we have assessed gene expression of several HDACs in a larger cohort of patients with ET, PV and PMF. Patients and Methods: Gene expression microarray studies have been performed on control subjects (n=21) and patients with ET (n =19), PV (n=41), and PMF (n=9). Most patients were studied on cytoreductive therapy, which for the large majority included hydroxyurea. Gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix HG-U133 2.0 Plus microarrays recognizing 54675 probe sets (38.500 genes). Total RNA was purified from whole blood and amplified to biotin-labeled aRNA and hybridized to microarray chips. Results: We identified 20439, 25307, 17417, and 25421 probe sets which were differentially expressed between controls and patients with ET, PV, PMF, and CPMNs as a whole, respectively (false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p values Discussion and Conclusions: Using global gene expression profiling of whole-blood from patients with CMPNs, we have found a pronounced deregulation of HDAC-genes, involving significant upregulation of the HDAC-genes 9 and 11 with the highest expression levels being found in patients with ET, in PMF (HDAC9) and in CMPNs both HDAC9 and HDAC11. Furthermore, we have identified that the HDAC-6 gene is progressively expressed in patients with ET, PV, and PMF reflecting a steady accumulation of abnormally expressed HDAC-6 during disease evolution. Our results lend further support to HDACs as important epigenetic targets in the future treatment of patients with CMPNs. Since the highest expression levels of HDAC-genes was recorded in ET (HDACs 9 and 11), in PMF (HDAC9) and in the whole CMPN-group both HDACs 9 and 11, their downregulation by HDAC-inhibitors might be associated with decreased disease activity including reduction of splenomegaly in MF. Preliminary data indicate that enlarged spleens are diminished in subsets of patients during treatment with HDAC-inhibitors.

f5e69cfd3f0f98b45d8efa33aa531c504c13bdbc,Multiple comparison procedures for neuroimaging genomewide association studies.,"Recent research in neuroimaging has focused on assessing associations between genetic variants that are measured on a genomewide scale and brain imaging phenotypes. A large number of works in the area apply massively univariate analyses on a genomewide basis to find single nucleotide polymorphisms that influence brain structure. In this paper, we propose using various dimensionality reduction methods on both brain structural MRI scans and genomic data, motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We also consider a new multiple testing adjustment method and compare it with two existing false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment methods. The simulation results suggest an increase in power for the proposed method. The real-data analysis suggests that the proposed procedure is able to find associations between genetic variants and brain volume differences that offer potentially new biological insights.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wen-Yu Hua"", ids = ""39104865""); list(name = ""Thomas E.

There has been a lack of epidemiological cohort studies to confirm these findings in human populations. We examined cross-sectional associations between measures of gut microbial diversity and taxonomic composition and blood pressure (BP) in 529 participants of the biracial (black and white) CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). We sequenced V3-V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA marker gene using DNA extracted from stool samples collected at CARDIAâ€™s Year 30 follow-up examination (2015â€“2016; aged 48â€“60 years). We quantified associations between BP (hypertension [defined as systolic BP â‰¥140 mmâ€‰Hg or diastolic BP â‰¥90 mmâ€‰Hg or antihypertension medication use] and systolic BP) and within and between-person diversity measures. We conducted genera-specific multivariable-adjusted regression analysis, accounting for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. Hypertension and systolic BP were inversely associated with measures of &agr;-diversity, including richness and the Shannon Diversity Index, and were distinguished with respect to principal coordinates based on a similarity matrix of genera abundance. Several specific genera were significantly associated with hypertension and systolic BP, though results were attenuated with adjustment for body mass index. Our findings support associations between within-person and between-person gut microbial community diversity and taxonomic composition and BP in a diverse population-based cohort of middle-aged adults. Future study is needed to define functional pathways that underlie observed associations and identify specific microbial targets for intervention.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shan Sun"", ids = ""145107808""); list(name = ""Anju Lulla"", ids = ""13766873""); list(name = ""Michael Sioda"", ids = ""15513847""); list(name = ""Kathryn Winglee"", ids = ""5131757""); list(name = ""Michael C.

3a4092eecfced2e028045d9327428261995ebb61,RNA World research-still evolving.,"One step forward, two steps back. That's how laboratory research seems to progress for most grad students and postdocs from week to week. Yet, when we step back and look at how far the RNA field has progressed in the 20 years since the RNA journal was born, we get a very different perspective. The international community of RNA scientists, through hard work, serendipity and building on each othersâ€™ findings, has made remarkable discoveries. In this perspective, I will remind the reader of the state of RNA science then, in 1995, where the field is now, and what the next 20 years may bring. 
 
Then 
In 1995, the hot new science being presented at RNA conferences was concentrated in two areasâ€”RNA splicing and ribozymesâ€”and there was also a lot of action in RNA editing, snoRNAs, hnRNPs, tRNAs, translation, and HIV RNA. Although the intron-exon structure of eukaryotic genes had been discovered almost 20 years earlier, it took some time for the chemical mechanism to be worked out, spliceosome assembly and snRNP functions to be understood, and alternative splicing to be fully appreciated. These mechanistic investigations were in full swing by 1995. Ribozymes, having been discovered in 1982, were also well studied, and structural analysis was a major topic but still primitive. Most RNA scientists conceptualized the structures of ribozymes and other functional RNAs as flat base-paired secondary structures. The field was on the verge of jumping from 2D to 3D, with the crystal structure of one conformation of the hammerhead ribozyme having just been published by McKay's group. Crystal structures of a large ribozyme domain (1996) and a full active group I ribozyme (1998) were still in the future. Ribosome crystal structures were a dream in 1995, but by a few years later we had them. 
 
 
Most striking is what we did not know in 1995: 
 
 
We did not know of RNA interference or siRNAs, miRNAs or piRNAs, the Fire and Mello paper still three years in the future. Although the discovery of this large class of ncRNAs had been presaged in 1993 papers by the Ambros and Ruvkun labs, the generality of their initial example in nematode worms was unknown. 
 
 
We did not know of riboswitches, remarkable given their abundance. These RNA regulatory elements bind small-molecule metabolites and switch gene expression on and off at the level of transcription or translation or RNA splicing. 
 
 
We did not know much of bacterial sRNAs, small RNA regulators that act by base-pairing to mRNAs. 
 
 
We did not know that DNA elimination in ciliates was orchestrated by scnRNAs. 
 
 
We did not understand that bacteria had an RNA-based acquired immune system, stored in their DNA in the form of Clusters of Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), and we certainly did not know that this system would function in eukaryotes to provide a robust new tool for genome editing. 
 
 
We had a growing list of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but we did not appreciate the magnitude of the lncRNA universe or their incredibly diverse functions. 
 
 
 
 
 
Now 
RNA science has undergone a revolution in the past 20 years. We've moved from looking at one RNA-one protein systems (or small multiples thereof) to doing experiments genome-wide and transcriptome-wide. As has been the case for molecular biology since its birth, technology drives innovation, and rapid deep sequencing of nucleic acids and mass spectrometry proteomics now allow RNA scientists to do massively parallel experiments. Instead of measuring the level of a transcript relative to several control RNAs, we use RNAseq to measure the level of every transcript in the cell. Instead of assessing transcription from a gene with nuclear run-on assays, we use GROseq to capture instantaneous transcription genome-wide. Instead of testing whether RNA X binds to protein Y, we use RIPseq or CLIPseq or a related technique to catalog all of the RNAs in a particular cell type that are associated with protein Y. Instead of assessing translation by asking whether a particular RNA is â€œon polysomes,â€ we interrogate the coding potential of large genomes and evaluate translational mechanisms transcriptome-wide by â€œribosome profiling.â€ 
 
These high-throughput technologies have opened the door to a brave new world of RNA science. The technologies are disruptiveâ€”they transform the way we design experiments and the way we make discoveries. At the same time, they come associated with new limitations (and, dare I say, dangers) that are recognized by the research community but not always dealt with in a robust manner. 
 
RNAseq and quantitative RT-PCR measurements can give distorted RNA abundances due to variable efficiencies of PCR, preferential degradation of certain RNAs, etc. RIPseq and CLIPseq protocols that involve antibody pull-down of a protein may reveal not only direct binding partners but also indirect interacters and RNAs that simply come along for the ride. In addition, there is the Tyranny of Large N. We demand that results be statistically significant, and in transcriptome-wide experiments the number of RNAs (N) is so large that papers commonly report P values of 10âˆ’30 or even 10âˆ’100, giving the impression that the claimed relationship is unassailably proven. Although better procedures for controlling the false discovery rate are now commonly utilized, statistical significance may or may not equate to biological relevance. 
 
Very importantly, the RNA community is not so enamored with transcriptome-wide experiments that we have forgotten the standards that we so laboriously and carefully established in past decades. First, an RNA secondary structure element is not believable just because sequence 1 is followed by a complementary sequence 1â€². Instead, one must compare good alignments of sequences from different organisms and find enough covariations (e.g., Aâ†’C on sequence 1 is accompanied by U â†’ G on sequence 1â€²) to establish the existence of base-pairing. Alternatively, site-specific mutagenesis is used to engineer mutations and test whether second-site compensatory mutations are indeed compensatory for proper function in vivo. These same criteria, established for RNA secondary structure, are also applied to hypotheses of intermolecular base-pairing of RNA. Just because two RNAs have some stretch of complementarity and can be shown to form a hybrid in vitro does not mean that they undergo base pairing in vivo. Furthermore, when a given protein is found to be associated with a cohort of RNAs using immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, then the next steps are to identify the binding motif and to quantify binding affinity and specificity. If a hypothesis fails these tests, then it is not necessarily wrong, but perhaps just incomplete. For example, one or more partner proteins may be enhancing the binding specificity in vivo, and they need to be identified and incorporated into the biochemical assays before specificity emerges in vitro. 
 
 
Tomorrow 
A major challenge for RNA science in the next 20 years is to figure out how many of the tens of thousands of lncRNAs expressed in eukaryotic genomes are functional, and then to understand their mechanisms of action. This is a daunting task; given that 10â€“50 nucleotides of RNA are sufficient to bind a protein or bind a small molecule or base-pair with mRNA or even perform catalysis, clearly a 10 kb lncRNA could perform multiple functions, and perhaps different functions in different cell types or stages of development (see T.R. Cech & J.A. Steitz, Cell 157:77â€“94, 2014). Unraveling this complexity will require integrating the powerful transcriptome-wide studies with deep validation at the level of biochemistry, cell biology and structural biology, and computational biology will become even more central than it is now. 
 
New experimental and computational tools will continue to lead the way. Genome editing with the CRISPR-Cas9 system promises to be very useful, allowing genetic alterations in mammalian cells as has been possible in the past with yeast and bacteria. High-throughput nucleic acid sequencing will continue to leap forward with new approaches, including single-molecule sequencing and identification of modified nucleotides. Real-time super-resolution microscopy will reveal the intricate movement of RNAs and RNPs in living systems. And electron microscopy at previously unforeseen near-atomic resolution will provide structures of the enormous RNP complexes that are central to RNA biology. These and other technological advances provide optimism that the next 20 years of RNA science will be just as discovery-filled as the last 20.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas R Cech"", ids = ""2627196"")",33cafc7160f34476754fa554808e334e98c182e2; 899ff51be70d8c905be1ac8665a0cc119cc8ea9e; 70095b51411196f48ac049cf74cd7fbc277b1474; d0b2668c52990524bdf0bfe054a06a5e39bcb3e8,,RNA,21 4,"

6bde3c1af1864c15047c15d172f2824be5399321,De novo identification and quantification of single amino-acid variants in human brain.,"The detection of single amino-acid variants (SAVs) usually depends on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) database. Here, we describe a novel method that discovers SAVs at proteome level independent of SNPs data. Using mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing algorithm, peptide-candidates are identified and compared with theoretical protein database to generate SAVs under pairing strategy, which is followed by database re-searching to control false discovery rate. In human brain tissues, we can confidently identify known and novel protein variants with diverse origins. Combined with DNA/RNA sequencing, we verify SAVs derived from DNA mutations, RNA alternative splicing, and unknown post-transcriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, quantitative analysis in human brain tissues reveals several tissue-specific differential expressions of SAVs.

Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser.

To our knowledge, all of the existing research assumes that a usual p-value is available for each hypothesis.

eafcbac7c8c2347e18ec8a176162d5e7e4d14398,Potential Role of Aromatase over Estrogen Receptor Gene Polymorphisms in Migraine Susceptibility: A Case Control Study from North India,"BACKGROUND
The present study was undertaken to find out the role of estrogen pathway related gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to migraine in Northern Indian population. Aromatase, CYP19A1 (rs10046 and rs4646); estrogen receptors, ESR1 (rs2234693, rs1801132, rs2228480 and rs9340799) and ESR2 (rs1271572 and rs1256049) polymorphisms were selected for the present study.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
The patients were recruited in two cohorts - primary (207) and replicative (127) along with 200 healthy controls and genotyped for various polymorphisms. Logistic regression analysis was applied for statistical analyses. The results were validated in the replicative cohort and pooled by meta analysis using Fisher's and Mantel-Haenszel test. Furthermore, Benjamini - Hochberg false discovery rate test was used to correct for multiple comparisons. CYP19A1 rs10046 and CYP19A1 rs4646 polymorphisms were found to confer risk and protective effect, respectively. Out of four ESR1 polymorphisms, only rs2234693 variant allele was significantly associated in migraine with aura. No significant associations were observed for ESR2 polymorphisms. Significant haplotypes were identified for CYP19A1 and ESR1 polymorphisms. Gene- gene interactions of genotypes as well as haplotypes were observed for CYP19A1- ESR1 showing both risk and protective combinations.


CONCLUSION
We strongly suggest CYP19A1 polymorphisms to be the major contributing factors in migraine susceptibility instead of genetic variants of estrogen receptors.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jayashri Ghosh"", ids = ""33975473""); list(name = ""Gunjan Joshi"", ids = ""4011280""); list(name = ""Sunil Pradhan"", ids = ""79666682""); list(name = ""Balraj Mittal"", ids = ""48594579"")",3ab8720fdea3b4a0d68ea9effe2d5034b2c66b93; 8e7faa9517deebf6894bbc10ed5ab60c04972dd5; faf572ca1b5befc6e8b000b415355c6a7fdfb913; 3f40d0d32801cfd7966f262649a20fa8c6d84d71; 1a925d17eb4ee42db14bca2cb2a634928d9a2e47; debfd2150218df5b297ff023a7a6f0539e6be50b; f1534c833b8de8d46d52bbe4d98e743fced70c75; 04ce8068081b19626e25d97251f641328b64ac21; ea965935fc75ca149409685c73569cafcfc8deae; a46ea3272c8aa24c38a5699cd11f13d7eaf7f834; dc3d06dc2dce71297e17fd04589d259e60549921; fd7ff3e8fce998bc823fad5ac98b1199409b92f1; 21b398d857fea177671d42e3732f0cb55df74734,73bdbac752d2e58717ea4cf087250100167c70db; 0fac368a4494f504a0cd7f9b18c775b080cda42a; 48e29302b99abe2c8f2271e4878eadcbe96b1871; bc94fe8f5b049ea0328bd15979eafb2591083234; f55b52a2ed53c40713971c4a3eef1d3fd4b85112; 54b1054baebc1e0bd4b3cfd4553b6a0f6b121855; 39ea7aa77926fc36cac600680b54ea949a361c4e; d3834498a36150cbd9377f7de74795c6a79057c2; f188ae77f1f9f503055dacbb4349faaf66a02a56; 6af34c130eb05a9b2af950b9495f8ea4a215f182; d4b7d8a38247e86f4ee5abde136e5cbc75051256; 551651e3626fbed5c0c2b4feb35822e7f848b12e; d16175b8fe25d9bcc5142123e3e48c7cb6b62ec5; 63858efea4028ee25c3a871487fd3d8442717a6f; f555f0e2d505ca2a7e3d4a0957ab300e7ab8c7e1; 4407504f0191c1b1dcf016101716074f84b10537; e2ba421a34dd767f9de2241853bf75b1bcf053e9; 07f4abfe827513843fc42c0d60105b16f106bef4; 3a384115a6174596d22f3f808ed978d0cfa03adf; cfc93b915f4fbebdc7a1659ec5af8bc6ff42f7bd; eaefab563c5aa332238c5d40d8f1829737c5a8c7; c7a61fc9cc417f955b2c2b80e14faece0b9f19ca; 11a560b9aa274962355250cd1aa8dc9141d3838a; 6416e7f0eb26a939c03b57c36499aab9834731bd; e259bd881af2e438e6df86839e72b975b425d93a; 0c734b08c8f825626aeee68bb06a0eedd2931e04; 641222115b9737acf3f1e31eeced77c8fbde096f; 0cb23887c4be51d08d288eb2f48f6c16a1d821b1; 7e14415038409fa94da65c1109d17f73a0587bf0; a2be13520421a6e1036b7157c2bd81e7aeedf223; 7235b8cc01faccb5dbc4daa65ca9ef40890e3f09,PLoS ONE,7,

These new methods allow scientists to simultaneously process thousands of hypothesis tests. The frequentist approach to this problem is made by using different testing error measures that allow to control the Type I error rate at a certain desired level. Alternatively, in this article, a Bayesian hierarchical model based on mixture distributions and an empirical Bayes approach are proposed in order to produce a list of rejected hypotheses that will be declared significant and interesting for a more detailed posterior analysis. In particular, we develop a straightforward implementation of a Gibbs sampling scheme where all the conditional posterior distributions are explicit.

a6815786c645a92a8c383fa6c4fc488c70f9bd06,Cell-of-Origin Subtype Prediction of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Using Gene Expression and Proteomic Data,"Introduction Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subtypes can be identified based on immunohistochemistry, somatic mutation and gene expression profiles. These cell-of-origin (COO) subtypes have distinct biological and pathogenic characteristics. In addition, studies have shown the association of COO with drug response such as with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) as well as targeted therapy. Therefore, proper assessment of COO subgroup is an important step in treatment selection and outcome. In this study, we sought to develop predictive COO models using RNA-Seq based gene expression profiling and plasma proteomic data, focusing on the two defined major DLBCL subtypes - germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC). Methods COO subgroups of patient samples were assigned by the Hans algorithm. Data from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq platform (RNA-Seq). A subset of samples were used as a training set to select differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ABC vs. GCB lymphomas to build support vector machine (SVM) classification models. The model with best leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) on the training set was applied to the remaining samples to assess its initial predictive power. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA, Broad Institute) and key pathway analysis (KPA, Clarivate Analytics) were also utilized to further explore the underlying biology of each COO subtype. Protein expression data using the Olink Proteomics platform was obtained from baseline patient plasma samples. Protein biomarkers to differentiate ABC and GCB subgroups were identified from a set of training samples and evaluated in independent cohorts. Due to notable batch effect, batch information was included and specified as a random factor in the model. Results Genes identified by Scott et al. (Blood 2014) for COO assignment were first tested in our RNA-Seq training data of 6 GCB and 8 ABC samples. Thirteen of 15 gene markers showed significant differences between the ABC and GCB subgroups. From these markers, we further selected 6 to build machine learning models based on fold change, false discovery rate and entropy. This 6-gene signature include 3 markers relatively up-regulated in ABC subtype and 3 up-regulated in GCB subtype. A SVM model with these genes achieved 100% LOOCV on the training data and correctly predicted COO of 20/22 samples in the validating cohort with 1 GCB and 1 ABC samples misclassified. These two samples were also misclassified if a larger panel of signature genes from Scott et al. (Blood 2014) was used. KPA on the DEGs from ABC vs. GCB predicted the activation of NFKB1and STAT4/5 transcription factors as key elements upstream of the DEGs, indicating promoted signaling of NFÐºB and STAT pathways in ABC subgroup. On the other hand, REST was predicted as an inhibited upstream regulator of some DEGs. RCOR1, a corepressor of REST, has significantly lower expression level in the ABC subgroup in our data. These may imply the inhibition of REST/RCOR1 pathway in ABC patients. Plasma protein data from two studies were used to form a training set with 21 GCB and 6 ABC. A set of differentially expressed analytes from ABC vs. GCB were identified which included several targets of the NFÐºB pathway. In an independent cohort containing 5 GCB and 4 ABC plasma samples, many of these same plasma proteins showed differential expression profiles between ABC and GCB, making them potential blood-based biomarkers for COO determination. Conclusions In this study, we built a SVM model with a subset of genes from Scott et al. (Blood 2014) to accurately predict COO of refractory DLBCL from archival FFPE tissue. Further analyses of the RNA-Seq data disclosed alterations in key transcriptional hubs between the different COO subgroups. Olink plasma data from independent cohorts demonstrated potential protein markers for a plasma-based differentiation of the ABC and GCB subtypes. These biomarkers and machine learning models are being further validated using additional datasets. Disclosures Liu:Incyte Research Institute: Employment, Equity Ownership.

7a468fcbf7a8c19d21645ebc73e5b585278fdf6f,Disturbed neurovascular coupling in hemodialysis patients,"Background
Altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) have been reported in hemodialysis patients. However, neurovascular coupling impairments, which provide a novel insight into the human brain, have not been reported in hemodialysis patients.


Methods
We combined arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) techniques to investigate neurovascular coupling alterations and its relationships with demographic and clinical data in 46 hemodialysis patients and 47 healthy controls. To explore regional neuronal activity, ALFF was obtained from resting-state functional MRI. To measure cerebral vascular response, CBF was calculated from ASL. The across-voxel CBF-ALFF correlations for global neurovascular coupling and CBF/ALFF ratio for regional neurovascular coupling were compared between hemodialysis patients and healthy controls. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare the intergroup differences in CBF and ALFF. Multiple comparisons were corrected using a voxel-wise false discovery rate (FDR) method (P < 0.05).


Results
All hemodialysis patients and healthy controls showed significant across-voxel correlations between CBF and ALFF. Hemodialysis patients showed a significantly reduced global CBF-ALFF coupling (P = 0.0011) compared to healthy controls at the voxel-level. Of note, decreased CBF/ALFF ratio was exclusively located in the bilateral amygdala involved in emotional regulation and cognitive processing in hemodialysis patients. In hemodialysis patients, the decreased CBF (right olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and bilateral insula) and ALFF (bilateral precuneus and superior frontal gyrus) were mainly located in the default mode network and salience network-related regions as well as increased CBF in the bilateral thalamus.

36e2ee77159b7bfa360a789d49441c550827c3f2,A generalized correlated binomial distribution with application in multiple testing problems,"A typical microarray experiment often involves comparisons of hundreds or thousands of genes. Since a large number of genes are compared, simple use of a significance test without adjustment for multiple comparison artifacts could lead to a large chance of false positive findings. In this context, Tsai et al. (Biometrics 59:1071â€“1081, 2003) have presented a model that studies the overall error rate when testing multiple hypotheses. This model involves the distribution of the sum of non-independent Bernoulli trials and this distribution is approximated by using a beta-binomial structure. Instead of using a beta-binomial model, in this paper, we derive the exact distribution of the sum of non-independent and non-identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. The distribution obtained is used to compute the conditional false discovery rates and the results are compared to those obtained, in Table 3, by Tsai et al.

e4e2d89f72dd000c528dcbd1b568336c32badf5a,Comparing methods of analyzing fMRI statistical parametric maps,"Approaches for the analysis of statistical parametric maps (SPMs) can be crudely grouped into three main categories in which different philosophies are applied to delineate activated regions. These being type I error control thresholding, false discovery rate (FDR) control thresholding and posterior probability thresholding. To better understand the properties of these main approaches, we carried out a simulation study to compare the approaches as they would be used on real data sets. Using default settings, we find that posterior probability thresholding is the most powerful approach, and type I error control thresholding provides the lowest levels of type I error. False discovery rate control thresholding performs in between the other approaches for both these criteria, although for some parameter settings this approach can approximate the performance of posterior probability thresholding. Based on these results, we discuss the relative merits of the three approaches in an attempt to decide upon an optimal approach. We conclude that viewing the problem of delineating areas of activation as a classification problem provides a highly interpretable framework for comparing the methods. Within this framework, we highlight the role of the loss function, which explicitly penalizes the types of errors that may occur in a given analysis.",2004,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan Marchini"", ids = ""144329254""); list(name = ""Anne M.

061babdd50111af7fda95ceb794f51147c57cf2d,Clock genes may influence bipolar disorder susceptibility and dysfunctional circadian rhythm.,"Several previous studies suggest that dysfunction of circadian rhythms may increase susceptibility to bipolar disorder (BP). We conducted an association study of five circadian genes (CRY2, PER1-3, and TIMELESS) in a family collection of 36 trios and 79 quads (Sample I), and 10 circadian genes (ARNTL, ARNTL2, BHLHB2, BHLHB3, CLOCK, CRY1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, DBP, and NR1D1) in an extended family collection of 70 trios and 237 quads (Sample II), which includes the same 114 families but not necessarily the same individuals as Sample I. In Sample II, the Sibling-Transmission Disequilibrium Test (sib-tdt) analysis showed nominally significant association of BP with three SNPs within or near the CLOCK gene (rs534654, P = 0.0097; rs6850524, P = 0.012; rs4340844, P = 0.015). In addition, SNPs in the ARNTL2, CLOCK, DBP, and TIMELESS genes and haplotypes in the ARNTL, CLOCK, CSNK1E, and TIMELESS genes showed suggestive evidence of association with several circadian phenotypes identified in BP patients. However, none of these associations reached gene-wide or experiment-wide significance after correction for multiple-testing. A multi-locus interaction between rs6442925 in the 5' upstream of BHLHB2, rs1534891 in CSNK1E, and rs534654 near the 3' end of the CLOCK gene, however, is significantly associated with BP (P = 0.00000172). It remains significant after correcting for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate method. Our results indicate an interaction between three circadian genes in susceptibility to bipolar disorder.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jiajun Shi"", ids = ""49887675""); list(name = ""Jacqueline K.

Comparing the estimation results between the four-factor model and the conditional model reveals that the use of conditioning information improves the performance of Australian managed funds, shifting the distribution of alphas to the right. This result is robust to the adoption of the residual-only bootstrap procedure. In addition, when we adopt the conditional model to examine performance persistence by controlling the FDR, we find that Australian managed funds do not exhibit performance persistence.",2014,Economics,"list(name = ""Sangbae Kim"", ids = ""48388716""); list(name = ""Francis In"", ids = ""143930765""); list(name = ""Philip Inyeob Ji"", ids = ""81205448""); list(name = ""Raphael Jonghyeon Park"", ids = ""119226878"")",0bf4aeb3b6c094a0f51354678e2ca48b4c6acc5e,,Pacific-basin Finance Journal,26,244-256

The two theoretical measure of an ANN is training and testing. Those are pre-processed based on Minkowski distance as modified pillar k-means algorithm. It is an algorithm to optimize the initial centroids for k-means clustering with Minkowski distance. Modified pillar k means make use of cluster analysis to segment students into groups according to their grade value. An efficient optimization method called inertia weight firefly optimization algorithm for optimizing weight in ANN Classification. In order to progress the performance of the Firefly Algorithm (FA), the time changeable inertia weight is imported into position resumption of FA.

5e8ec9eb30801d15481794870726cc1c834bb286,Comparative analysis of false discovery rate methods in constructing metabolic association networks,"Gaussian graphical model (GGM)-based method, a key approach to reverse engineering biological networks, uses partial correlation to measure conditional dependence between two variables by controlling the contribution from other variables. After estimating partial correlation coefficients, one of the most critical processes in network construction is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) to assess the significant associations among variables. Various FDR methods have been proposed mainly for biomarker discovery, but it still remains unclear which FDR method performs better for network construction. Furthermore, there is no study to see the effect of the network structure on network construction. We selected the six FDR methods, the linear step-up procedure (BH95), the adaptive linear step-up procedure (BH00), Efron's local FDR (LFDR), Benjamini-Yekutieli's step-up procedure (BY01), Storey's q-value procedure (Storey01), and Storey-Taylor-Siegmund's adaptive step-up procedure (STS04), to evaluate their performances on network construction. We further considered two network structures, random and scale-free networks, to investigate their influence on network construction. Both simulated data and real experimental data suggest that STS04 provides the highest true positive rate (TPR) or F1 score, while BY01 has the highest positive predictive value (PPV) in network construction.

e38f264b76b0ed98a6228767cc46f01dab2e0344,Metabolic networks underlying cognitive reserve in prodromal Alzheimer disease: a European Alzheimer disease consortium project.,"UNLABELLED
This project aimed to investigate the metabolic basis for resilience to neurodegeneration (cognitive reserve) in highly educated patients with prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD).


METHODS
Sixty-four patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who later converted to AD dementia during follow-up, and 90 controls, underwent brain (18)F-FDG PET. Both groups were divided into a poorly educated subgroup (42 controls and 36 prodromal AD patients) and a highly educated subgroup (48 controls and 28 prodromal AD patients). Brain metabolism was first compared between education-matched groups of patients and controls. Then, metabolism was compared between highly and poorly educated prodromal AD patients in both directions to identify regions of high education-related metabolic depression and compensation. The clusters of significant depression and compensation were further used as volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) in a brain interregional correlation analysis in each prodromal AD subgroup to explore metabolic connectivity. All analyses were performed by means of SPM8 (P < 0.001 uncorrected at peak level, P < 0.05 false discovery rate-corrected at cluster level; age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and center as nuisance).


RESULTS
Highly educated prodromal AD patients showed more severe hypometabolism than poorly educated prodromal AD patients in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri and the left middle occipital gyrus (ROI depression). Conversely, they showed relative hypermetabolism in the right inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri (ROI compensation). The sites of compensation, mainly corresponding to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC), showed wide metabolic correlations with several cortical areas in both hemispheres (frontotemporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus) in highly educated prodromal AD patients but not in poorly educated prodromal AD patients. To provide evidence on whether these metabolic correlations represent preservation of the physiologic networks of highly educated control subjects (neural reserve) or rather the recruitment of alternative networks (neural compensation), or a combination of the two, we performed metabolic connectivity analysis of the DLFC in highly educated controls as well. The correlation sites of right DLFC partly overlapped those of highly educated prodromal AD patients but were less extended.


CONCLUSION
The present findings suggest that highly educated prodromal AD patients can cope better with the disease thanks to neural reserve but also to the recruitment of compensatory neural networks in which the right DLFC plays a key role.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Silvia Morbelli"", ids = ""3732613""); list(name = ""Robert Perneczky"", ids = ""145155523""); list(name = ""Alexander Drzezga"", ids = ""78439337""); list(name = ""Giovanni B.

The gene expression profile GSE9508 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including five samples of non-malignant bone (the control), seven samples for non-metastatic patients (six of which were analyzed in duplicate), and 11 samples for metastatic patients (10 of which were analyzed in duplicate). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between osteosarcoma and control samples were identified by packages in R with the threshold of |logFC (fold change)|â€‰>â€‰1 and false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Osprey software was used to construct the interaction network of DEGs, and genes at protein-protein interaction (PPI) nodes with high degrees were identified. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and WebGestalt software were then used to perform functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses for PPI networks, in which Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 was considered statistically significant. Compared to the control samples, the expressions of 42 and 341 genes were altered in non-metastatic OS and metastatic OS samples, respectively. A total of 15 significantly enriched functions were obtained with Gene Ontology analysis (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The DEGs were classified and significantly enriched in three pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, lysosome and axon guidance. Genes such as HRAS, IDH3A, ATP6ap1, ATP6V0D2, SEMA3F and SEMA3A were involved in the enriched pathways. The hub genes from metastatic OS samples are not only bio-markers of OS, but also help to improve therapies for OS.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bi-Yong Deng"", ids = ""49758667""); list(name = ""Ying-qi Hua"", ids = ""8262088""); list(name = ""Zheng-dong Cai"", ids = ""153567110"")",,f391fbc53cc27e8f80e466d65232e5fb826be549,European Journal of Medical Research,20,

While these are not the only methods to deal with multiplicity, inference with small samples and large sets of hypotheses depends on the specific choice of the p-value used to control the FDR in the presence of nuisance parameters. In this paper we propose to use the partial posterior predictive p-value [Bayarri, M.J., Berger, J.O., 2000. p-values for composite null models. J. Amer. Statist.

7e611287aa63fec3cfc211d05a0269ace293e2b6,[Statins decreases expression of five inflammation-associated microRNAs in the plasma of patients with unstable angina].,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the influence of treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on the expression profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the plasma of patients with unstable angina (UA).


METHODS
The Taqman low-density miRNA array (TLDA) and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) were used to identify distinct miRNA expression profiles in the plasma of UA patients treated with long-term and regular statins (UA receiving statins, n=6) compared with UA patients who had not received statins therapy before (UA received no statins, n=6). These differentially expressed miRNAs discovered in the profiling were further validated by real-time PCR in another 20 controls with non-cardiac chest pain, 26 UA patients received no statins, and 19 UA patients received statins.


RESULTS
By using TLDA and SAM, significantly decreased expression levels of 21 miRNAs were observed in the UA patients receiving statins compared with those who received no statins (fold change>3 and false discovery rate<0.0001%). The unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on miRNA expression clearly separated the UA patients receiving statins from those who received no statins. Consistent with the profiling data, the levels of 5 inflammation-associated miRNAs (miR-106b, miR-21, miR-25, miR-451, and miR-92a) were down regulated (P<0.05) in the UA patients receiving statins compared with those who received no statins.


CONCLUSION
A group of inflammation-associated miRNAs, consisting of miR-106b, miR-21, miR-25, miR-451, and miR-92a, could be decreased by treatment with statins and may be used as a novel biomarker for effectiveness of statins therapy in patients with UA.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Zhang"", ids = ""47539562""); list(name = ""Jing-yi Ren"", ids = ""5755432""); list(name = ""Hong Chen"", ids = ""47666554""); list(name = ""Guan-ping Han"", ids = ""14343752"")",f72be13b010783623a13a89150c6c1f5ce904561; 4ea6ba4c258eff28d630bfc5952c4f76f79c061b,,Beijing da xue xue bao.

b91a69b7317b2f7e9f5898d292b8608b92416b96,Abstract 4597: A novel variant in DNA repair gene GTF2H4 is associated with lung cancer risk: A reanalysis of GWAS datasets from the TRICL consortium,"Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PA

DNA repair pathways maintain genomic integrity and stability, and dysfunction of DNA repair is involved in cancer. We hypothesize that genetic variants in DNA repair genes are associated with risk of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we performed a large-scale meta-analysis of 123,371 SNPs in 169 DNA repair genes obtained from six datasets of previously published genome-wide association studies (GWASs), consisting of 12,160 lung cancer cases and 16,838 controls. We evaluated functional relevance of the identified, previously unpublished important and significant SNPs. Across the six GWASs, 14 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with lung cancer risk with a false discovery rate (FDR) of P < 0.05, of which rs114596632 in GTF2H4 at 6q31.33 was the most statistically significant SNP (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.12-1.25, Pcombined = 5.40 Ã— 10âˆ’10). The SNP rs114596632 was not strongly correlated with the previously reported GWAS hit MSH5 rs3131379 in that region (r2 = 0.383). Further mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region identified that rs114596632 was partially tagged by HLA-B*0801 (r2 = 0.592) and HLA-C*0701 (r2 = 0.675). Importantly, the rs114596632 T allele was significantly associated with decreased DNA repair capacity (DRC) measured in peripheral T lymphocytes and decreased mRNA expression levels of GTF2H4 in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We also validated two previously known SNPs in DNA repair genes MSH5 and XRCC4 associated with lung cancer risk. Subsequent pathway analysis with gene relationships across implicated loci (GRAIL) revealed multiple significant connections for GTF2H4, ERCC2, and MMS19. Our results provide evidence that genetic variants of GTF2H4 confer susceptibility to lung cancer and suggest the involvement of GTF2H4 in the etiology of lung cancer.

716ff70961cfe30924bea4ab9ea89dee55ebf845,W-ChIPeaks: a comprehensive web application tool for processing ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data,"UNLABELLED
ChIP-based technology is becoming the leading technology to globally profile thousands of transcription factors and elucidate the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in living cells. It has evolved rapidly in recent years, from hybridization with spotted or tiling microarray (ChIP-chip), to pair-end tag sequencing (ChIP-PET), to current massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). Although there are many tools available for identifying binding sites (peaks) for ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq, few of them are available as easy-accessible online web tools for processing both ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data for the ChIP-based user community. As such, we have developed a comprehensive web application tool for processing ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data. Our web tool W-ChIPeaks employed a probe-based (or bin-based) enrichment threshold to define peaks and applied statistical methods to control false discovery rate for identified peaks. The web tool includes two different web interfaces: PELT for ChIP-chip, BELT for ChIP-seq, where both were tested on previously published experimental data. The novel features of our tool include a comprehensive output for identified peaks with GFF, BED, bedGraph and .wig formats, annotated genes to which these peaks are related, a graphical interpretation and visualization of the results via a user-friendly web interface.

81835db0d540e543c92109cef4646127b44eb090,microRNA downregulation in plasmacytoid dendritic cells in interferon-positive systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome,"Objective
To investigate miRNA expression in relation to transcriptomic changes in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in SLE and APS. pDCs are major producers of IFNÎ± in SLE and APS, and miRNAs are emerging as regulators of pDC activation.


Methods
miRNA and mRNA expression were measured by OpenArray and RNA-sequencing in pDCs of SLE, SLE + APS (APS secondary to SLE) and primary APS (PAPS) patients. The miRNA profile of patients was compared with the miRNA pattern of TLR7-activated pDCs.


Results
Among 131 miRNAs detected in pDCs, 35, 17 and 21 had a significantly lower level of expression in SLE, SLE + APS and PAPS patients, respectively, as compared with healthy controls (HC). Notably, the miRNA profile did not significantly differ between SLE and APS, but was driven by the presence or absence of an IFN signature. TLR7 stimulation induced a general downregulation of miRNAs, similar to the pattern observed in SLE and APS patients. miR-361-5p, miR-128-3p and miR-181a-2-3p expression was lower in patients with a high IFN signature (false discovery rate <0.05) as compared with patients with a low IFN signature and HCs. Pathway enrichment on the overlap of miRNA targets and upregulated genes from the RNAseq indicated that these miRNAs are involved in pDC activation and apoptosis.


Conclusion
Lower miRNA expression in pDCs is shared between SLE, SLE + APS and PAPS and is related to the IFN signature. As pDCs are the alleged source of the IFN signature in these patients, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms/pathways leading to pDC dysregulation in SLE and APS might open novel pathways for therapeutic intervention.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucas L van den Hoogen"", ids = ""144430721""); list(name = ""Marzia Rossato"", ids = ""5362138""); list(name = ""Ana P Lopes"", ids = ""145162855""); list(name = ""Aridaman Pandit"", ids = ""47852409""); list(name = ""Cornelis P J Bekker"", ids = ""1435145047""); list(name = ""Ruth D E Fritsch-Stork"", ids = ""1398648655""); list(name = ""Joel A.

Significant differential regulation of 1,139 putative genes (p < 0.05 T-test with Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate) was detected in the gut epithelial tissue; where 63% of these genes were down-regulated and 37% of genes were up-regulated compared to the mock-infected control. Genes that play important roles in digestive physiology were noted as being generally down-regulated. Among these were aminopeptidases, trypsin-like serine proteases, lipases, esterases and serine proteases. Genes related to the immune response reacted in a complex nature having peptidoglycan binding and viral antigen recognition proteins and antiviral pathway systems down-regulated, whereas antimicrobial peptides and prophenoloxidase were up-regulated. In general, detoxification genes, specifically cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase were down-regulated as a result of infection. This report offers the first comparative transcriptomic study of H. zea compared to HzSNPV infected H. zea and provides further groundwork that will lead to a larger understanding of transcriptional perturbations associated with viral infection and the host response to the viral insult in what is likely the most heavily infected tissue in the insect.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey E.

We present a lipidomics analysis of human Parkinson's disease tissues. We have focused on the primary visual cortex, a region that is devoid of pathological changes and Lewy bodies; and two additional regions, the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex which contain Lewy bodies at different disease stages but do not have as severe degeneration as the substantia nigra.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lipidomics techniques for an initial screen of 200 lipid species, significant changes in 79 sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid and cholesterol species were detected in the visual cortex of Parkinson's disease patients (nâ€Š=â€Š10) compared to controls (nâ€Š=â€Š10) as assessed by two-sided unpaired t-test (p-value <0.05). False discovery rate analysis confirmed that 73 of these 79 lipid species were significantly changed in the visual cortex (q-value <0.05). By contrast, changes in 17 and 12 lipid species were identified in the Parkinson's disease amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, respectively, compared to controls; none of which remained significant after false discovery rate analysis. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry techniques, 6 out of 7 oxysterols analysed from both non-enzymatic and enzymatic pathways were also selectively increased in the Parkinson's disease visual cortex. Many of these changes in visual cortex lipids were correlated with relevant changes in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and an oxidative stress response as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
The data indicate that changes in lipid metabolism occur in the Parkinson's disease visual cortex in the absence of obvious pathology. This suggests that normalization of lipid metabolism and/or oxidative stress status in the visual cortex may represent a novel route for treatment of non-motor symptoms, such as visual hallucinations, that are experienced by a majority of Parkinson's disease patients.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danni Cheng"", ids = ""47061095""); list(name = ""Andrew M.

d6d39f15ef71a43b4eb99eaff5b697eaedf1e449,Abstract 313: Elucidation Of The Fibrotic Transcription Factors Gene Network Leading To Chagas Heart Disease,"Background: Trypanosoma cruzi the causative agent of Chagas heart disease (CHD) remains incurable. The major pathology induced by the parasite is cardiac fibrosis leading to heart failure followed by death. The mechanisms of T. cruzi induced cardio-pathology remains largely unknown.

We hypothesize that T. cruzi infection regulates the expression of profibrotic genes in human cardiac myocytes (HCM), tilting the heart towards a profibrotic phenotype seen in CHD patients.

Methods and Results: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of T. cruzi induced cardiac fibrosis, we challenged primary HCM with T. cruzi for two hours and purified total RNA for microarray. We investigated changes at the whole transcriptome level on an affymetrix platform. The arrays were done in triplicates at different time points; changes in gene expression greater than 2-fold and having a Benjamini and Hochburg false discovery rate corrected p-value <0.05 were considered significant. The microarray data was validated using real-time PCR followed by PCR array and immunoblotting, to evaluate changes in the protein expression levels of fibrotic transcription factors. Protein expression levels were evaluated in triplicate and analyzed by ANOVA. The fibrotic interactome induced by T. cruzi in HCM was elucidated using Cytoscape.

Our results indicate that exposure of HCM to T. cruzi upregulates the transcript levels of two transcription factors associated with fibrosis, SNAI1 (more than 2 fold up-regulated) and Early Growth Response protein 1, EGR1, (about four fold up-regulated). SNAI1 and EGR1 were increased at the protein level. Furthermore, we identified the first interactome regulating fibrosis in primary HCM induced by T. cruzi .

Conclusions: This is the first report showing that T. cruzi upregulates the expression of profibrotic transcription factors in HCM early during the process of cellular infection and the operational fibrotic interactome. Thus, abnormal sustained expression of SNAI1 and EGR1 upregulate the expression of genes essential for conversion of HCM towards a profibrotic phenotype in CHD. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which T. cruzi induces cardiac fibrosis will lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for CHD.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Pius N Nde"", ids = ""4554614""); list(name = ""Aniekanabassi N.

Characterization of genome-wide transcriptional changes in liver and adipose tissues of ZDF (fa/fa) rats fed R-lipoic acid by next-generation sequencing. Physiol Genomics 45: 1136â€“1143, 2013. First published October 8, 2013; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00138.2013.â€”We report on the characterization of lipogenic tissue transcriptional networks that support physiological responses of obese rats to a lipid-lowering bioactive food compound, R-lipoic acid (LA). Nine-week-old male Zucker diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats were fed a chow diet supplemented with 3 g LA per kg diet or pair fed for 2 wk. At the end of the trial, high-quality RNA was extracted from the liver and epididymal fat and subjected to transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Results showed a substantially higher number of differentially expressed genes [DEG, false discovery rate adjusted P 0.05 and absolute log2 (fold change) 1] in the liver (110 genes) vs. epididymal fat (10 genes). Most epididymal fat DEG were also differentially expressed in liver and shared directionality of change. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these transcripts revealed significant enrichment of GO categories related to immune response, stress response, lipid metabolism, and carboxylic acid metabolic processes. Of interest, interferonrelated genes involved in defense against microorganisms and innate immune response were induced by LA. Lipid metabolism-related transcript changes observed in LA-fed animals included downregulation of lipogenic genes (Pnpla3, Pnpla5, Elovl6, Acly, Gpam, and Aacs) and concomitant upregulation of short-, medium-, and longchain fatty acid metabolic processes (Acot1, Acot2, Acsf2, and Crat). Transcriptional changes were accompanied by the lowering of abdominal adiposity and blood triacylglycerol levels. We conclude that LA dietary supplementation induces prominent gene expression changes in liver in support of significant improvement of whole-body lipid status.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Anjeza Pashaj"", ids = ""4972671""); list(name = ""Xiaohua Yi"", ids = ""48674633""); list(name = ""Mengna Xia"", ids = ""4460833""); list(name = ""Stephanie A.

56cddfa7a7ffee22106dfbe3b7e6679470ee728f,Optimal control of false discovery criteria in the two-group model.,"The highly influential two group model in testing a large number of statistical hypotheses assumes that the test statistics come from a mixture of a high probability null distribution and a low probability alternative. Optimal control of the marginal false discovery rate (mFDR), in the sense that it provides maximal power (expected true discoveries) subject to mFDR control, is known to be achieved by thresholding the local false discovery rate (locFDR) with a fixed threshold. In this paper we address the challenge of controlling optimally the popular false discovery rate (FDR) or positive FDR (pFDR) rather than mFDR in the two group model. These criteria are less conservative than the mFDR criterion, so they make more rejections in expectation. We derive the optimal multiple testing (OMT) policies for these two error criteria. These policies turn out to be thresholding the locFDR with a threshold that is a function of the entire set of statistics. By carefully studying the structure of the optimal policies, we develop an efficient algorithm for finding these policies. With this algorithm, we can easily derive and apply these OMT procedures for problems with thousands of hypotheses. We show that for $K=5000$ hypotheses there can be significant power gain in OMT with FDR or pFDR versus mFDR control. The OMT policies with FDR and pFDR control coincide when the probability of zero rejections is zero for the OMT policy with FDR control. When the signal is weak, the OMT policy with pFDR control has a significantly lower probability of zero rejections than the OMT policy with FDR control. Our results lead us to suggest that the pFDR is (arguably) the preferred error measure to control optimally for the two group model.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ruth Heller"", ids = ""144622349""); list(name = ""Saharon Rosset"", ids = ""1816048"")",,715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 37c21a0937505d63a844204050455948b84c8a6a; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 2ac5e637a01b40b70003e67234afd3edd0c54095; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; bcf806c48efad2a1a2ba2a22dc6a24fa126203e6; aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 5043fd247ee67d229bfb656264d634abc44518f7,arXiv: Methodology,,

Design: Prospective cohort studies of 499 HIV-positive and 206 HIV-negative individuals from the Women's Interagency HIV Study and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Methods: Twenty-four acylcarnitine species were measured in plasma samples of participants at baseline. Carotid artery plaque was assessed using repeated B-mode carotid artery ultrasound imaging in 2004â€“2013. We examined the associations of individual and aggregate short-chain (C2â€“C7), medium-chain (C8â€“C14) and long-chain acylcarnitines (C16â€“C26) with incident carotid artery plaque over 7 years. Results: Among 24 acylcarnitine species, C8-carnitines and C20â€Š:â€Š4-carnitines showed significantly lower levels comparing HIV-positive to HIV-negative individuals (false discovery rate adjusted Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05); and C20-carnitines and C26-carnitines showed significantly higher levels in HIV positive using antiretroviral therapy than those without antiretroviral therapy (false discovery rate adjusted Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). In the univariate analyses, higher aggregated short-chain and long-chain acylcarnitine scores were associated with increased risk of carotid artery plaque [risk ratios (RRs)â€Š=â€Š1.22 (95% confidence interval 1.02â€“1.45) and 1.20 (1.02â€“1.41) per SD increment, respectively]. The association for the short-chain acylcarnitine score remained significant [RRâ€Š=â€Š1.23 (1.05â€“1.44)] after multivariate adjustment (including traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors). This association was more evident in HIV-positive individuals without persistent viral suppression [RRâ€Š=â€Š1.37 (1.11â€“1.69)] compared with those with persistent viral suppression during follow-up [RRâ€Š=â€Š1.03 (0.76â€“1.40)] or HIV-negative individuals [RRâ€Š=â€Š1.02 (0.69â€“1.52)]. Conclusion: In two HIV cohorts, plasma levels of most acylcarnitines were not significantly different between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. However, higher levels of aggregated short-chain acylcarnitines were associated with progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simin Hua"", ids = ""7734312""); list(name = ""Justin M.

7e002c408151395081ccb34aebed4428c9664931,Association of genetic variants with dyslipidemia.,"Although genetic variants, which regulate lipid metabolism, have been extensively investigated in Caucasian populations, the genes, which confer susceptibility to dyslipidemia in Japanese individuals, remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to examine a possible association among hypertriglyceridemia, hypoâ€‘high density lipoprotein (HDL)â€‘cholesterolemia or hyperâ€‘low density lipoprotein (LDL)â€‘cholesterolemia in Japanese individuals with 29 polymorphisms observed to confer susceptibility for coronary heart disease. This was performed through metaâ€‘analyses of genomeâ€‘wide association studies in Caucasian populations. The study population comprised 2,354 individuals with dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, hypoâ€‘HDLâ€‘cholesterolemia or hyperâ€‘LDLâ€‘cholesterolemia) and 3,106 control individuals. To compensate for multiple comparisons of genotypes, a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 was adopted to determine the statistical significance of the associations. Comparisons of allele frequencies using the Ï‡2 test revealed that rs964184 of zinc finger gene (ZPR1; FDR=2.1x10â€‘7), rs4845625 of interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R; FDR=0.032), rs46522 of ubiquitinâ€‘conjugating enzyme E2Z gene (UBE2Z; FDR=0.032) and rs17514846 of furin (FDR=0.041) were significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The Ï‡2 test revealed that rs599839 of proline/serineâ€‘rich coiledâ€‘coil 1 (PSRC1; FDR=0.004) and rs2075650 of translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40; FDR=0.004) were significantly associated with hyperâ€‘LDLâ€‘cholesterolemia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender and body mass index revealed that rs964184 of ZPR1 (P=5.1x10â€‘7; odds ratio, 1.37; dominant model), rs4845625 of IL6R (P=0.0019, odds ratio, 1.25; dominant model) and rs46522 of UBE2Z (P=0.0039, odds ratio, 1.19; dominant model) were significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia, and that rs599839 of PSRC1 (P=0.0004, odds ratio, 0.70; dominant model) and rs2075650 of TOMM40 (P=0.0004, odds ratio, 1.43; dominant model) were significantly associated with hyperâ€‘LDLâ€‘cholesterolemia. Therefore, ZPR1, IL6R, and UBE2Z may be susceptibility loci for hypertriglyceridemia, whereas PSRC1 and TOMM40 may be such loci for hyper-LDL-cholesterolemia in Japanese individuals.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shintaro Abe"", ids = ""50442444""); list(name = ""Fumitaka Tokoro"", ids = ""14843204""); list(name = ""Reiko Matsuoka"", ids = ""49703778""); list(name = ""Masazumi Arai"", ids = ""6123162""); list(name = ""Toshiyuki Noda"", ids = ""6343133""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Hideki Horibe"", ids = ""3512685""); list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Shinya Minatoguchi"", ids = ""6167313""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",3fbc6854dcf67bdac0a1cf5ad34321085f0f1fa4; 51e9fdbbd5c91e4b0fc689fe932b128640261dcc; 84fff1af0eb189547242df73b7002492bb8e64a9; fc6ca828e6b0ac31849e81231da61a4379301b30; 08d02938f5bd92deb7f6af222cc81e350209ed94; bad4c95f4b515034a4578e738fffb0ef476d7775; 7ae895e910a2d9745d6961774d8954223502af0e; b7152df19445841e99347335efb3bce9b20693c9,b1fd2d8a026475556b0006eb68888624c18fb5cc; 3193da63f068dc95a5ac9a8fb3810e9ba2c80cd0; 3b19e94d8102fe2b31aecb5bb488243c2830f5d8; a4834d5d528c7aa9f85f3356395b5492231b9b72; a436fafc138148b3043ac669a023749291466f41; e313aa5b7a18d89779fc3f99d28b93b5bb4fb040; 9bccf91c7a83d5625336ba1ad0edf597ee15485b; 131908954c64ebc8fdf97de120c92fe354f08f59; 1ca64d1a17f1c865164257e02e28cd3a96da4095; bf13e07f7647e281fd4d577da91786b4fe0a55ba; 423df7d78cd7e556c7e7ef351a9081aa80496668; 2c94c5ffd53fa998f445fff6b440cb90999849bc; b80af2ff9da1edd1daaca8155078d73d23847adf; 0a2f4f5589e845782b228d188dd29d3884fc5a79; 49d040875495d0af42968c59d789f1f6001bf95a; 01051a9e72e6b8bf3ce2da57cb129eeb987b7d53; b0fe993b5e23246b8f6f23d6e9169d79aaa31bb1; 9e18ce41e1feacbc7de48d2f66756a5b7f8a07da; c5a1acfae53781bb01a7207eb83ec39ec4b2b966; b45ea78de9edaad285c8600d52138c33025ec5d6; 9a5395562209c3c31132f0e86989b974e6d954fa; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; 4663e0ddd22743e12f18d6603d5e41fc18b6a96a; 06d5f8b660846f38871c56d6ce19acd60050e477; 2f458aabfceb5f6f9000bf38a696ee39d3819f2d; 669c6d312223be715001994a052865fed3ab7d34; 1486ef4b88b05cb46d1170b91803c60e068dc143; fedd22e910322e2825c36ebd34eda45588789c15; 9aa790df3bb5f26854e9b60423116975612de608; f5cbc27e9b35eed2354294d57d41ce0f0bd9074d; 77eb51d571874ffacbf2d73bb98927c6243e4767; 68792c58c6763fa2d995209dd5a9b15e2ee516da; 6e1db95751f74c9fb17ee4b1457cd796de5929f5; dfb897857a2c2dac8f656ea44362287274ed33a1; 74308dd0d116bb9398364ff982822559899220f2; 744986f7ce904543c37cc0fb9a34af6937a2f829; 58e5c19c2871bf90e789e4f7c18e52f4e05e4d97; e49216aafb94573ff90327b6e84b1b0cf7ac24ec; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; c2b6e7bcde46ddf06f0018b8f8affb3fff1b619f; ee6974e90c11f79a061dcf34772058a0dcced218; bb8a077ffd8f54569780a302bf36a8cf438d0fe1; a22b150cbdd302288b91b698b567530fe2dfa84d; a34e21c5bf1c49b47d931f73cf7e7f5a95a9c6fc; 61dc48d782f25aef44b4a6cc2f964b8025bcdf1f; 73b66c27fcdfe8a2a3cfec1b611036b7c52270f3; f107f48441a39421c5049c0db14a99d643767d5c,Molecular medicine reports,12 4,"

A large fraction of patients (âˆ¼30%), especially those of African descent, show a weak response to treatment. To interrogate the contribution of variable transcriptional response to inter-ethnic differences, we measured in vitro lymphocyte GC sensitivity (LGS) and transcriptome-wide response to GCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Africanâ€“American (AA) and Europeanâ€“American (EA) healthy donors. We found that transcriptional response after 8â€‰h treatment was significantly correlated with variation in LGS within and between populations. We found that NFKB1, a gene previously found to predict LGS within populations, was more strongly downregulated in EAs on average. NFKB1 could not completely explain population differences, however, and we found an additional 177 genes with population differences in the average log2 fold change (false discovery rate<0.05), most of which also showed a weaker transcriptional response in AAs.

f449df5ed220c7e7187d34adda5fb4bb681ca0c1,Transcriptomic analysis identified up-regulation of a solute carrier transporter and UDP glucuronosyltransferases in dogs with aggressive cutaneous mast cell tumours.,"Gene expression analyses have been recently used in cancer research to identify genes associated with tumorigenesis and potential prognostic markers or therapeutic targets. In the present study, the transcriptome of dogs that had died because of mast cell tumours (MCTs) was characterised to identify a fingerprint having significant influence on prognosis determination and treatment selection. A dataset (GSE50433) obtained using a commercial canine DNA microarray platform was used. The transcriptome of seven biopsies obtained from dogs with histologically confirmed, surgically removed MCTs, treated with chemotherapy, and dead for MCT-related causes, was compared with the transcriptional portrait of 40 samples obtained from dogs with histologically confirmed, surgically removed MCTs and that were still alive at the end of the follow-up period. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), eight transcripts were validated by quantitative real time PCR and their mRNA levels were measured in a cohort of 22 additional MCTs. Statistical analysis identified 375 DEGs (fold change 2, false discovery rate 5%). The functional annotation analysis indicated that the DEGs were associated with drug metabolism and cell cycle pathways. Particularly, members of solute carrier transporter (SLC) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene families were identified as dysregulated. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 22 additional MCTs identified the separate cluster dogs dead for MCT-related causes. SLCs and UGTs have been recently recognised in human cancer as important key factors in tumour progression and chemo-resistance. An in-depth analysis of their roles in aggressive canine MCT is warranted in future studies.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mery Giantin"", ids = ""4814949""); list(name = ""Chiara Baratto"", ids = ""49268688""); list(name = ""Laura Marconato"", ids = ""5848398""); list(name = ""Marta Vascellari"", ids = ""3823073""); list(name = ""Franco Mutinelli"", ids = ""4742734""); list(name = ""Mauro Dacasto"", ids = ""3838842""); list(name = ""Anna Granato"", ids = ""4129835"")",e6ef0afe1348f67e0d1fd591ee778b28744e9463; 2a5141d79ba6879c4a00efe53ba163ab57a247cd; ee0a11593a4523933b51f499285b310a5e97c0e7; 883e008151e2c3ddc1a572f17a9cc6b500e62a0b; a2a783eb49ecdf8860a8c2d6f5947f9952364df4; 5736872b418b0eeceecdb9e20a907a68a7c45b4b,b8278204b4eb6ea5303e8961317a318fb038b045; 756270c88700c85bd35493def73e4a9612730d4f; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; b1a7f72d77c8d44fbcf3b041cb56a82f019ab941; 0bcb477a7d6a6894f6a049485b2423b9bb0eea75; 4de41ac02b96d13a13b5aa6c747adbc574096f71; 93ec46b7f91f15bebdc698c8a8cabb6dddf9aaae; dfffc74671c2b4d463ac79b6c9d513c6a2cfd815; ba90bba7a71bba24edd5aaa966de19f86fc6fd22; b51b931ca163f4be92a7391f786fd777a3896770; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 1867e840f8f5e6656eef8de84452b6f98d4a2bc2; b19206ec6b151745a7b71f018579e32a84674b9e; 46e7c008c4ab07a5352c39be32d3c7fcd5fe3124; a003abaec6ae7c88cb4bde375a14e434af1241b1; 811dcf74a29bbf98226d3561b118b7ffd22b8963; c28551016d6a4f910434ce38976b169713465cac; da46c2b1812f59fe398ff646c67f2f0ec933744d; 1d91df22b4ba75e51a3a397cbd50bf6cac55cb53; f13226dfc77638fd11bf2d59fa79c63cff42783a; 7b4902420e67733745982b66f980b8fe58a6b79b; 011fc81cb09b0e059884aec29af3fca9cfe529eb; caa18bc01bc528fd1b0388d29a48e644251d340c; d1270753bf994f0e7dc861c53be9dd4f55ad60c4; 12f775444ea6b76f21b7f2071afae8f08e2d1c1e; 062d6b9d2c9ccb0593875a7bca55632854a1b08c; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 87a488f6c398369c7b83ebad2d0040dbfc7b02cd; 1cefadbce9e274634a65042f062bbc0473f2862a; eda76621112f4d3ab5a8d3d6eeafcfb50ab4ea86; 024a0d386c9a5fc484708e064cfef0a9a745ef9a; 3ead43ff40a43937e592d1d85c8ee9c09e1cec60; a9f8f5bb638fe89d8047f921458bdd2e9141cf3e; a3a27ffafeffba1e64194bdb836a76a3db3e10d5; 7ed9bb2a76f214e03f7b33b7e6a0d9284e18452d; c180faa5ce9c0762b5e921fc1403f0865825784d; a9f352eb9cabda6dd68c8d8ad94c9ad540ad3a25; 9d91c2da032bf4106d8c05a48d8b10928ec9be95; 04eaa03dc670afa88c9f3c83fc8da08ef4d31cdd; f0a858eb5bf6613ad5f56a4b69bf323d7fb0bd6a; f61cd9f71580a26d3910438efca805934967f250; 7f39ec52ae67bf11b1f7d8a30b0d4bd0d49af932; 46213b5972d802c91e5fe60ddc309ba0cbfb422c; e872349d3142319225fa91ce28af4dc72a7409c4; 0559668f15b89a2efbdedbacce043f65f380d774; f52ea82e37c20fe15b42edec1a9bf8c690c41134; 0f329bd3c17018839b8caf98237a4817f556f795; 408bd5970d694d7a9c3b7ba5a9ac071ec83fb5a4,Veterinary journal,212,"

4d4fe70ba85b321de29ce44464c3dc6ca2fc98cb,Subcellular Proteome Landscape of Human Embryonic Stem Cells Revealed Missing Membrane Proteins.,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have the capacity for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation, which are of clinical importance for regeneration medicine. Despite the significant progress of hESC study, the complete hESC proteome atlas, especially the surface protein composition, awaits delineation. According to the latest release of neXtProt database (January 17, 2018; 19â€¯658 PE1, 2, 3, and 4 human proteins), membrane proteins present the major category (1047; 48%) among all 2186 missing proteins (MPs). We conducted a deep subcellular proteomics analysis of hESCs to identify the nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane proteins in hESCs and to mine missing membrane proteins in the very early cell status. To our knowledge, our study achieved the largest data set with confident identification of 11â€¯970 unique proteins (1% false discovery rate at peptide, protein, and PSM levels), including the most-comprehensive description of 6â€¯138 annotated membrane proteins in hESCs. Following the HPP guideline, we identified 26 gold (neXtProt PE2, 3, and 4 MPs) and 87 silver (potential MP candidates with a single unique peptide detected) MPs, of which 69 were membrane proteins, and the expression of 21 gold MPs was further verified either by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry or by matching synthetic peptides in the Peptide Atlas database. Functional analysis of the MPs revealed their potential roles in the pluripotency-related pathways and the lineage- and tissue-specific differentiation processes. Our proteome map of hESCs may provide a rich resource not only for the identification of MPs in the human proteome but also for the investigation on self-renewal and differentiation of hESC.

b227e11dfd2866cf4b2cfa1fa72af1a485a96ecd,Clinical utility of serologic testing for celiac disease in ontario: an evidence-based analysis.,"UNLABELLED
OBJECTIVE OF ANALYSIS: The objective of this evidence-based evaluation is to assess the accuracy of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease in subjects with symptoms consistent with this disease. Furthermore the impact of these tests in the diagnostic pathway of the disease and decision making was also evaluated. CELIAC DISEASE: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that develops in genetically predisposed individuals. The immunological response is triggered by ingestion of gluten, a protein that is present in wheat, rye, and barley. The treatment consists of strict lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients with celiac disease may present with a myriad of symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, among others.


SEROLOGIC TESTING IN THE DIAGNOSIS CELIAC DISEASE
There are a number of serologic tests used in the diagnosis of celiac disease. Anti-gliadin antibody (AGA)Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA)Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG)Anti-deamidated gliadin peptides antibodies (DGP)Serologic tests are automated with the exception of the EMA test, which is more time-consuming and operator-dependent than the other tests. For each serologic test, both immunoglobulin A (IgA) or G (IgG) can be measured, however, IgA measurement is the standard antibody measured in celiac disease.


DIAGNOSIS OF CELIAC DISEASE
According to celiac disease guidelines, the diagnosis of celiac disease is established by small bowel biopsy. Serologic tests are used to initially detect and to support the diagnosis of celiac disease. A small bowel biopsy is indicated in individuals with a positive serologic test. In some cases an endoscopy and small bowel biopsy may be required even with a negative serologic test. The diagnosis of celiac disease must be performed on a gluten-containing diet since the small intestine abnormalities and the serologic antibody levels may resolve or improve on a GFD. Since IgA measurement is the standard for the serologic celiac disease tests, false negatives may occur in IgA-deficient individuals.


INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE
The incidence and prevalence of celiac disease in the general population and in subjects with symptoms consistent with or at higher risk of celiac disease based on systematic reviews published in 2004 and 2009 are summarized below.


INCIDENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION
ADULTS OR MIXED POPULATION: 1 to 17/100,000/year


CHILDREN
2 to 51/100,000/yearIn one of the studies, a stratified analysis showed that there was a higher incidence of celiac disease in younger children compared to older children, i.e., 51 cases/100,000/year in 0 to 2 year-olds, 33/100,000/year in 2 to 5 year-olds, and 10/100,000/year in children 5 to 15 years old.


PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION
The prevalence of celiac disease reported in population-based studies identified in the 2004 systematic review varied between 0.14% and 1.87% (median: 0.47%, interquartile range: 0.25%, 0.71%). According to the authors of the review, the prevalence did not vary by age group, i.e., adults and children.


PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN HIGH RISK SUBJECTS
Type 1 diabetes (adults and children): 1 to 11%AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASE: 2.9 to 3.3%FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES OF PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE: 2 to 20% PREVALENCE OF CELIAC DISEASE IN SUBJECTS WITH SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH THE DISEASE: The prevalence of celiac disease in subjects with symptoms consistent with the disease varied widely among studies, i.e., 1.5% to 50% in adult studies, and 1.1% to 17% in pediatric studies. Differences in prevalence may be related to the referral pattern as the authors of a systematic review noted that the prevalence tended to be higher in studies whose population originated from tertiary referral centres compared to general practice.


RESEARCH QUESTIONS
What is the sensitivity and specificity of serologic tests in the diagnosis celiac disease?What is the clinical validity of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? The clinical validity was defined as the ability of the test to change diagnosis.What is the clinical utility of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease? The clinical utility was defined as the impact of the test on decision making.What is the budget impact of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease?What is the cost-effectiveness of serologic tests in the diagnosis of celiac disease?


METHODS



LITERATURE SEARCH
A literature search was performed on November 13(th), 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st) 2003 and November 13(th) 2010. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology.

Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) for the different serologic tests were calculated using a bivariate, binomial generalized linear mixed model. Statistical significance for differences in sensitivity and specificity between serologic tests was defined by P values less than 0.05, where ""false discovery rate"" adjustments were made for multiple hypothesis testing. The bivariate regression analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.; Cary, NC, USA). Using the bivariate model parameters, summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves were produced using Review Manager 5.0.22 (The Nordiac Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2008). The area under the sROC curve (AUC) was estimated by bivariate mixed-efects binary regression modeling framework. Model specification, estimation and prediction are carried out with xtmelogit in Stata release 10 (Statacorp, 2007). Statistical tests for the differences in AUC estimates could not be carried out. The study results were stratified according to patient or disease characteristics such as age, severity of Marsh grade abnormalities, among others, if reported in the studies. The literature indicates that the diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease may be affected in patients with chronic liver disease, therefore, the studies identified through the systematic literature review that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of serologic tests for celiac disease in patients with chronic liver disease were summarized. The effect of the GFD in patiens diagnosed with celiac disease was also summarized if reported in the studies eligible for the analysis.


SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
PUBLISHED SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: Five systematic reviews of studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of serologic celiac disease tests were identified through our literature search. Seventeen individual studies identified in adults and children were eligible for this evaluation.

ffa479f1646ea679a7969df92ffac221459ff0e7,GLI1 Transcription Factor Affects Tumor Aggressiveness in Patients With Papillary Thyroid Cancers,"Abstract A significant proportion of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) present with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) and lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, the molecular mechanism of tumor invasiveness in PTC remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to understand the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in tumor aggressiveness in patients with PTC. Subjects were patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 2012 to 2013 in a single institution. Frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor tissues with contralateral-matched normal thyroid tissues were collected. Hh signaling activity was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (National Center for Biotechnology Information) were subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). BRAFT1799A and telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T were analyzed by direct sequencing. Among 137 patients with PTC, glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) group III (patients in whom the ratio of GLI1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level in tumor tissue to GLI1 mRNA level in matched normal tissue was in the upper third of the subject population) had elevated risk for ETE (odds ratio [OR] 4.381, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.414â€“13.569, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.01) and LNM (OR 5.627, 95% CI 1.674â€“18.913, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.005). Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 2 (GLI2) group III also had elevated risk for ETE (OR 4.152, 95% CI 1.292â€“13.342, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.017) and LNM (OR 3.924, 95% CI 1.097â€“14.042, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.036). GSEA suggested that higher GLI1 expression is associated with expression of the KEGG gene set related to axon guidance (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.031, false discovery rateâ€Š<â€Š0.05), as verified by qRT-PCR and IHC staining in our subjects. GLI1 and GLI2 expressions were clearly related to aggressive clinicopathological features and aberrant activation of GLI1 involved in the axon guidance pathway. These results may contribute to development of new prognostic markers, as well as novel therapeutic targets.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jandee Lee"", ids = ""52151954""); list(name = ""Seonhyang Jeong"", ids = ""6415994""); list(name = ""Cho Rok Lee"", ids = ""4458412""); list(name = ""Cheol Ryong Ku"", ids = ""6209219""); list(name = ""Sang-Wook Kang"", ids = ""100934734""); list(name = ""Jong Ju Jeong"", ids = ""5019819""); list(name = ""Kee-Hyun Nam"", ids = ""52434215""); list(name = ""Dong Yeob Shin"", ids = ""4102251""); list(name = ""Woong Youn Chung"", ids = ""2998203""); list(name = ""Eun Jig Lee"", ids = ""4519636""); list(name = ""Young Suk Jo"", ids = ""4407509"")",26a599d8a3c2d9518a9a933fda06580d10cd317c; 70e28944434ae4257dc35b6923681f9b9d101a85; d733883eb79bb4a889c36fb451c4ae13bd2b893d; 879f9f5a84298fdd1e2802fecf5712b309859260; 50779cf8c5822cfcc64efaf7f8a369107aaff4dd; 97f944f20e19d636f1f5554aa5946cb26a2b34d8,8a9a5a39aca89c7a6df64772d7cc5cc2a87e192d; 032e25eed4c84c449b2166cbbc4d7fa86fc46f2d; 8f0ab3c86b4f6913eb389ccd53180384b0ee49dc; 2f6b3709be3a3549938ea809d6e965b31cb46ae6; 7292fcb10a849e5625b8a41abefd86da70affa31; d4fd1c69cbd331cc7a5c1e5d14424a265fdc94cb; 9c2cc17011836518df0a8f36d6b1ac7f866c2278; 2c0109ddbe1631a5930bed27d7081969106f27d5; 366725a43919df18e88374cb8062f7a43fec5b6d; 24ba0f7e0afd82607e7d42da1b2a072915c0d7b9; 19f92455d0300ccb14a60a23fe6ea4545b68fe03; 6b5cc718b568554ade3850005bb6e76961ff83ed; 520a53cd740a21deeb5006893af2486d3a74bd3e; 2bc3ab692b55aac5d40ec503e9060744618a3f67; 74d766b99eca342bc888d8c01168f8ecb1a2dfff; 9f5408995151708d9d417a7258bc7b6629469368; ab5771ca928c7df9792dae6232d5b4de533ce60b; 2d54450a356c3412b4b1fbc73cb75bb3c56e6a61; 5db51ac6ae9e36145bca286de270a226f1361e02; fd4eb4e01641fd84b57d7db49f0d467dd93df4f6; 7d6b138a45efdb72a1f2e143a3bc200041613702; 3d6c6ddbe1e4c4280066512742f3e71cc8fc310b; 659024252ed778425342d74ebd80f73629d32b2c; 14e39c1e43a15b599d6aace1ffa26ce6988d648c; cb2f7f69eb18567feb7aa29255b0f5a387ba6f68; ab8eb15709e630a05caa59a0ff29b0ec285e71c0; c04ea678848bd9770705a850c5fb6d97a1478ada; d0db251059054eda5585756d59123d7543ea9f20; 011361e5a0016de2e0d5a72b72127fa5c28d836a; b4f39e49b5d44c6f2f025be8a596b34c7e60180b; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; d49f2bd5baee3d83016a1c1e490ccbfd53bd55f8; 2171be651ad2962dd1f1bed5f919e15cb07001fc; 7140c55484aa6524a85f80448f39023e259cc06e; b4d349d8b6207499e02ca7890f71c3f38ff3b1cd; b7ee91201290b5e0e9e01d10ed5916804211459c; d7edc9bc1af3ad365b22141f2618158900d37dbb; 614546ee98b62cc187e350b0f5dec31baf3bf5a0; cfe88b1fc615b97a987fc8a2f25dac657de299fb; 158e7c7be3fd731625b8585a07506270c29e9f81; d8847c6080a86cca0fd6207aa2f637398bb73fd8; 29a1d8900a0d334c2603e149f986deb58d7e1c84; c754901d14215384adfda00aa950b595c935ac25; ce20e894eae52729161926b2aceb4193994980dc; 5f3662dffddfa6d44d2c3e351d15f27c94713087; 70c8f20e634c797c777b22ebed5025e36a3e15a3; 7bdee36d9bead53bafa493bd0efb97ba6b859b29; 38cc10db3a0636a1615d2855eeb352d2d5cf8b63; 447b9f6808240371efd0c2346e66ce958e12df57; 7c562279879e7a7888d4672aaf6d69f1ad36a48b,Medicine,94,
47d642a36b4d40295040eda67fad95926451e5a6,Association between the aspartic acid D-repeat polymorphisms and osteoarthritis susceptibility,"Objectives: Association between the D-repeat of asporin (ASPN) gene and osteoarthritis (OA) was still inconsistent. We performed this meta-analysis to systematically assess the D-repeat polymorphisms in OA susceptibility. Methods: Relevant studies were enrolled by searching databases. Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used for evaluating the association between ASPN gene and OA. Heterogeneity was calculated using the Q statistic, and three different subgroup analyses were performed on ethnicity, gender, and OA positions respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) was applied to regulate the multiple comparisons. Results: Twelve qualified articles involving 5190 OA patients and 5167 healthy controls were included. With D13 polymorphism, Caucasian male patients have low OA susceptibility (Pâ€Š=â€Š.008, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.024, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š0.83 [0.73â€“0.95]). As to D14 polymorphism, all male patients (Pâ€Š=â€Š.0004, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.001, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š1.38 [1.15â€“1.64]), Asian male patients (Pâ€Š=â€Š.01, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.01, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š1.72 [1.11â€“2.66]), and Caucasian male patients (Pâ€Š=â€Š.005, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.001, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š1.32 [1.09â€“1.60]) have high OA susceptibility. In the pooled-population of KOA with D14 polymorphism, overall male patients (Pâ€Š=â€Š.03, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.045, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š1.35 [1.02â€“1.78]) and Asian male patients (Pâ€Š=â€Š.01, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.03, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š1.72 [1.11â€“2.66]) have high OA risk. With D16 polymorphism, Latin America patients may have high OA risk (Pâ€Š=â€Š.04, PFDRâ€Š=â€Š.15, OR [95% CI]â€Š=â€Š1.43 [1.02â€“2.01]). Conclusion: Our results suggest that D-repeat of ASPN gene is mainly associated with male patients. The D13 polymorphism plays a protective role for OA in Caucasians male individuals while D14 plays a risk factor for KOA in male patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hong-lin Wang"", ids = ""49528260""); list(name = ""Xu Zhang"", ids = ""47957523""); list(name = ""Wentao Wu"", ids = ""37464026""); list(name = ""Mingyue Zhang"", ids = ""48984961""); list(name = ""Napoleon Bellua Sam"", ids = ""6556098""); list(name = ""Lei Niu"", ids = ""48448717"")",,6c3b7e00e68d9460bfc451f0d1e67188a700a6ad; 55f5edc24c4dd5a05a272a64bd9c8ca6c0fb14e9; 14f6aa52cd6b8745c9dfc0f6b96e53211b5b2d92; 920c499f22eace8bda58d0001291a67b7ba6e100; 3b1cc16162dc3bad855017ed3fb132efbbe759ed; 6e70edaeed783aae1ac0580a673f066e4dbf21fe; adbcf23bdaac4f6028fc1850d2c369d02604100b; 32a47311aa58ce832647c75c8b7c85d3a28a8139; bf70e47ec12923a1499015de7eaf8b17e99b78ce; 3716109445129501937cbfaef6463807f632bfeb; 47b4fc19f385210cd3bb28fedd626f29849efd2c; 516a6bdd646cbb4d684776377850259719fb73f9; f77996cb107905b272845dd21f876b729a83cb30; 711fe32cc8da42288b6499c47df6319fb076b0ee; f76fb1a5663a22ffb9e85a98bd3be40b9cccf9e2; 45a96ba25b2a8ad836762f8dad3f9b33eb5a3618; 052f4de483da470f0dcce60bd7ad10534a5ceed8; d17d7493f9decef26f9a18d8dd1b8ee51397a1d1; 9bd757fb2153b7e9af0893ac83de3d142e1b9e53; 0396b7a5972a1abee86b3642b3b65bb7d98bf7df; b99d22dd8cb02d50de5ded8993a3d5553aad6d35; ff3d33ea02c80c70b0ffcf4073d0a91e024ff852; 74710f2ee64bb91a4b9cca33037f4d7241fd1800; 7b25fa71df3330e743267c16dc39b12777706771; 6903a8faec04c932fca0891ba725aafe6c5425fc; ada4b23010ab606537ab5d1d39358e53de5b2c96; e3d83778787ca99c96c8b9ccba3ee7aa30ed278c; 12548ac8619e633b3614b38c640b7f81be0dcae2; 8d56df327303f1c3a32f00f4d3e7afd8c221ffe4,Medicine,97,
29e89f374c07c292accfa9cddc4d982933063b62,A novel framework for the network-wide distributed detection problem,"This paper presents a new framework for distributed target detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In our previous work, for multiple networked sensors collaboratively detecting the presence or absence of a target in the sensor field, every sensor uses an identical threshold for local decision-making. In this paper, we propose a framework where the sensors in the network collaboratively decide and select non-identical thresholds to improve network-wide detection performance in a dynamic manner. This threshold selection scheme is based on a new statistical metric called false discovery rate (FDR). Assuming a signal attenuation model, where the received signal power decays as the distance from the target increases, various performance indices like system level probability of detection and probability of false alarm are studied.

b3320ecfcb3cfd40500d7b040ad3d8d94020a39f,"Two-dimensional site frequency spectrum for detecting, classifying and dating incomplete selective sweeps.","The two-dimensional site frequency spectrum (2D SFS) was investigated to describe the intra-allelic variability (IAV) maintained within a derived allele (D) group that has undergone an incomplete selective sweep against an ancestral allele group. We observed that recombination certainly muddles the ancestral relationships of allelic lineages between the two allele groups; however, the 2D SFS reveals intriguing signatures of recombination as well as the genealogical structure of the D group, particularly the size of a mutation and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Coalescent simulations were performed to achieve powerful and robust 2D SFS-based statistics with special reference to accurate evaluation of IAV, significance of recombination effects, and distinction between hard and soft selective sweeps. These studies were extended to a case wherein an incomplete selective sweep is no longer in progress and ceased in the recent past. The 2D SFS-based method was applied to 100 intronic linkage disequilibrium regions randomly chosen from the East Asian population of modern humans to examine the P value distributions of the summary statistics under the null hypothesis of neutrality in a nonequilibrium demographic model. We argue that about 96% of intronic variants are non-adaptive with a 10% false discovery rate. Furthermore, this method was applied to six genomic regions in Eurasian populations that were claimed to have experienced recent selective sweeps. We found that two of these genomic regions did not have significant signals of selective sweeps, but the remaining four had undergone hard and soft sweeps and were dated, in terms of TMRCA, after the major out-of-Africa dispersal of modern humans.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoko Satta"", ids = ""4478826""); list(name = ""Wanjing Zheng"", ids = ""30346485""); list(name = ""Kumiko Nishiyama"", ids = ""47078389""); list(name = ""Risa L Iwasaki"", ids = ""1456235183""); list(name = ""Toshiyuki Hayakawa"", ids = ""50524237""); list(name = ""Naoko T.

144e4eec9ddd47fe64163821bee6b992dc653fa7,Noninvasive Serum Metabolomic Profiling Reveals Elevated Kynurenine Pathway's Metabolites in Humans with Prostate Cancer.,"This study aimed to apply high-resolution metabolomics to detect compounds that may contribute significantly to prostate cancer (PCa) development. The test population's sera for evaluating the metabolic differences consisted of healthy control ( n = 96) and PCa ( n = 50) groups. PCa patients were further divided into two groups based on whether their PSA level was >4 ( n = 25) or <4 ( n = 25). Univariate analysis was performed with the false discovery rate (FDR) at q = 0.05 to determine significantly different metabolites. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) clearly distinguished healthy subjects from PCa groups, while no significant difference was observed in PCa patients with PSA level < 4 or > 4. Mummichog, in combination with the KEGG and MetaboAnalyst, showed that tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway was most significantly enriched, with -log ( p) < 0.05. l-Tryptophan, kynurenine, anthranilate, isophenoxazine, glutaryl-CoA, ( S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA were upregulated in correlation with the PSA level of PCa patients; in contrast, indoxyl, indolelactate, and indole-3-ethanol, involved in the alternative pathway, were downregulated in the PCa patients. Validation and quantification of potential metabolites by MS/MS further confirmed the disruption of tryptophan, kynurenine, and anthranilate, suggesting that the metabolites of this pathway are potential biomarkers in patients with PCa.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adnan Khan"", ids = ""144361369""); list(name = ""Soo An Choi"", ids = ""4612198""); list(name = ""Jinhyuk Na"", ids = ""12927779""); list(name = ""Aryo Dimas Pamungkas"", ids = ""6455109""); list(name = ""Keum Ji Jung"", ids = ""1900615""); list(name = ""Sun Ha Jee"", ids = ""2043510""); list(name = ""Youngja H Park"", ids = ""15227308"")",3b3c8a9d679689fa7cf9492b4af38ceb585dacf3; 3dbc8a86363a043afa5e8957ad33458b9cc2ff4d,,Journal of proteome research,18 4,"

666d883656c921f9cb83db40656ea7c451dc5562,Candidate genes-based investigation of susceptibility to Human African Trypanosomiasis in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire,"Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is a Neglected Tropical Disease. Long regarded as an invariably fatal disease, there is increasing evidence that infection by T. b. gambiense can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, including latent infections, which are long lasting infections with no parasites detectable by microscopy. The determinants of this clinical diversity are not well understood but could be due in part to parasite or host genetic diversity in multiple genes, or their interactions. A candidate gene association study was conducted in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire using a case-control design which included a total of 233 subjects (100 active HAT cases, 100 controls and 33 latent infections). All three possible pairwise comparisons between the three phenotypes were tested using 96 SNPs in16 candidate genes (IL1, IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL12R, TNFA, INFG, MIF, APOL1, HPR, CFH, HLA-A and HLA-G). Data from 77 SNPs passed quality control. There were suggestive associations at three loci in IL6 and TNFA in the comparison between active cases and controls, one SNP in each of APOL1, MIF and IL6 in the comparison between latent infections and active cases and seven SNP in IL4, HLA-G and TNFA between latent infections and controls. No associations remained significant after Bonferroni correction, but the Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate test indicated that there were strong probabilities that at least some of the associations were genuine. The excess of associations with latent infections despite the small number of samples available suggests that these subjects form a distinct genetic cluster different from active HAT cases and controls, although no clustering by phenotype was observed by principle component analysis. This underlines the complexity of the interactions existing between host genetic polymorphisms and parasite diversity. Author summary Since it was first identified, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness has been described as invariably fatal. Recent data however suggest that infection by T. b. gambiense can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes in its human host including long lasting infections, that can be detected by the presence of antibodies, but in which parasites cannot be seen by microscopy; these cases are known as latent infections. While the factors determining this varied response have not been clearly characterized, the effectors of the immune responses have been partially implicated as key players. We collected samples from people with active HAT, latent infections and controls in endemic foci in the CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire. We tested the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 genes on susceptibility/resistance to HAT by means of a candidate gene association study. There was some evidence that variants of the genes for IL4, IL6, APOL1, HLAG, MIF and TNFA modified the risk of developing HAT. These proteins regulate the inflammatory response to many infections or are directly involved in killing the parasites. In this study, the results were statistically weak and would be inconclusive on their own, however other studies have also found associations in these genes, increasing the chance that the variants that we have identified play a genuine role in the response to trypanosome infection in CÃ´te Dâ€™Ivoire.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Bernadin Ahouty"", ids = ""12465531""); list(name = ""Mathurin Koffi"", ids = ""91462314""); list(name = ""Hamidou Ilboudo"", ids = ""1394793401""); list(name = ""Gustave Simo"", ids = ""33350473""); list(name = ""Enock Matovu"", ids = ""48940880""); list(name = ""Julius Mulindwa"", ids = ""5249872""); list(name = ""Christiane Hertz-Fowler"", ids = ""1403000111""); list(name = ""Bruno Bucheton"", ids = ""4389942""); list(name = ""Issa SidibÃ©"", ids = ""1989099""); list(name = ""Vincent Jammoneau"", ids = ""117018522""); list(name = ""Annette MacLeod"", ids = ""145079805""); list(name = ""Harry Noyes"", ids = ""47467301""); list(name = ""Simon-Pierre Nâ\200\231guetta"", ids = ""1412412937"")",,79eefbeeb76bda387dbed3de32b41d69a7f859a4; f00f52380ac1898938dfce2816354ea4f5518565; 75b8e4137019e8d0da485d98f63d824549af7fd5; 80ca9a23294b962899e2f7f07e9726202e6e234f; 0da7180de3dced8d175b317dddd394131134a65b; 93d7347f54597ab948ff83dfbf118548031c38ea; 7cb760526599ce4cf8d348842a0cbe3f35bfd0cb; ebbea6d4e02ffdb020159e72c93cd776d24cd7a8; 35318278ef68e32d27114affacf063d8c5df996e; b04d9b54dd279ead80f9e640ff35e983590c0dc2; 8cd8c25c45c3c7451b90ecb2dbc38bcd6f13c316; bdead41ae4435685eb09d337c694eb2f49126864; 7290ecd9ef772d925d4460a0e958b188a0b7a253; 5c0963c2b483a93becf036058a907253c78f688f; 14f4dbfa57cb774df163c077af34d51be99ee29b; 87a8f75fade9f80f0d85bf003bc42b28469c050b; 3a1d264344e072d995df204c32cca49b9998caf3; db1f53709f2b50df5b098eeeede01a8ea9b51952; 18f573648e5d37c80c42201d7bf2cf0ae948de60; 2c37fd0cc0f5fcd58aa4d4e80a05f066504cc073; 921e7bd5c02210f3b8137ce8beefac007bbb4c11; 5be575e02beae18ac2603d8e68a5d3d6b49a78d1; f2d1f52cd99f95e8a1c406a996c8dce59bcd9bfd; 4d16cec02d8077fda387493aa4474218538e3cda; d163e2292efdf75a0d4953527f55d6de427ad6f5; b468da69cc45cbb83383b8ca188fc79f45b3988f; d3d595406594bc4b948fc0f5f23618e584e0a185; 88eee3d64a397613c5bdc1dae178d785c2043a62; 6126379e9ffbf088fc5cf838ba53a9b95526d0d5; d6e95fc642a4c18755c3d7f82537925f0aecbce7; e89bc397d8759d7ac2578ea6c1eff56b4f5be146; 7f1bd538a916f4348b2794100622df3db30d5f68; 061046949322770bce163089f6ef7c8c9842ef0d; d1624dbafd1ef63ccb4122b5626c49787d999fd6; 4572c82d7a797972c7cf5d2b894a95c4dae854a9; c49819f459513a8cef528e9510fc278b704095dc,bioRxiv,,
787a79cfe63fa609f7ea9a9f48695f2cf25814e8,Effects of interacting networks of cardiovascular risk genes on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (the CODAM study),"Background:Genetic dissection of complex diseases requires innovative approaches for identification of disease-predisposing genes. A well-known example of a human complex disease with a strong genetic component is Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).Methods:We genotyped normal-glucose-tolerant subjects (NGT; n = 54), subjects with an impaired glucose metabolism (IGM; n = 111) and T2DM (n = 142) subjects, in an assay (designed by Roche Molecular Systems) for detection of 68 polymorphisms in 36 cardiovascular risk genes. Using the single-locus logistic regression and the so-called haplotype entropy, we explored the possibility that (1) common pathways underlie development of T2DM and cardiovascular disease -which would imply enrichment of cardiovascular risk polymorphisms in ""pre-diabetic"" (IGM) and diabetic (T2DM) populations- and (2) that gene-gene interactions are relevant for the effects of risk polymorphisms.Results:In single-locus analyses, we showed suggestive association with disturbed glucose metabolism (i.e. subjects who were either IGM or had T2DM), or with T2DM only. Moreover, in the haplotype entropy analysis, we identified a total of 14 pairs of polymorphisms (with a false discovery rate of 0.125) that may confer risk of disturbed glucose metabolism, or T2DM only, as members of interacting networks of genes. We substantiated gene-gene interactions by showing that these interacting networks can indeed identify potential ""disease-predisposing allele-combinations"".Conclusion:Gene-gene interactions of cardiovascular risk polymorphisms can be detected in prediabetes and T2DM, supporting the hypothesis that common pathways may underlie development of T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Thus, a specific set of risk polymorphisms, when simultaneously present, increases the risk of disease and hence is indeed relevant in the transfer of risk.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marleen M J van Greevenbroek"", ids = ""40108967""); list(name = ""Jian Zhang"", ids = ""49050952""); list(name = ""Carla van der Kallen"", ids = ""8241591""); list(name = ""Paul M H Schiffers"", ids = ""153337085""); list(name = ""Edith J.

Preterm delivery is associated with major morbidity and mortality and current efforts to prevent delivery until term are largely ineffective. Identification and semi-quantification of proteomic changes in uterine smooth muscle during pregnancy will allow for targeted research into how quiescence is maintained and what changes are associated with induction of labor. Examining preterm labor in this context will provide potential therapeutic targets for the management of preterm labor. We have recently performed two dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry on myometrial proteins isolated from pregnant patients in labor, pregnant patients not in labor, and pregnant patients in labor preterm. Using a conservative false discovery rate of 1% we have identified 2132 protein groups using this method and semi-quantitative spectral counting shows 201 proteins that have disparate levels of expression in preterm laboring samples.

0dac5206966ddda19f0fea7360c10ae3474224b2,Five-months-postoperative neuropsychological outcome from a pilot prospective randomized clinical trial of thalamic deep brain stimulation for Tourette syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE
Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder presenting with motor and/or sonic tics associated with frontostriatal dysfunction. This study provided pilot data of the neuropsychological safety of bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat medication-refractory TS in adults.


METHOD
This study used a repeated-measures design with pretest and 3-month follow-up from start of continuous bilateral DBS. Five male patients underwent DBS surgery for medically refractory TS. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate for any change in neuropsychological test scores, employing a false discovery rate. Outcome measures included 14 neuropsychological tests assessing psychomotor speed, attention, memory, language, visuoconstructional, and executive functions, as well as subjective mood ratings of depression and anxiety.


RESULTS
Average age was 28.2 years (SD = 7.5) with 12-17 years of education. Participants were disabled by tics, with a tic frequency of 50-80 per minute before surgery. At baseline, subjects' cognitive function was generally average, although mild deficits in sequencing and verbal fluency were present, as were clinically mild obsessive-compulsive symptoms. At 3 months of continuous DBS (5 months after implantation), 3 of 5 participants had clinical reductions in motor and sonic tics. Cognitive scores generally remained stable, but declines of moderate to large effect size (Cohen's d > 0.6) in verbal fluency, visual immediate memory, and reaction time were observed. Fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as fewer obsessions and compulsions, were reported after 3 months of continuous high-frequency DBS.

This study presents a label-free quantitative proteomics scheme that was used to select differentially regulated proteins with single-peptide hits and with <2-fold change at a 5% false discovery rate. The scheme incorporated a labeled internal control into two unlabeled samples to facilitate error modeling when there were no replicates for the unlabeled samples. The results showed that, while both a power law global error model with a signal-to-noise ratio statistic (PLGEM-STN) and a constant fold-change threshold could be used, neither of them alone was stringent enough to select differentially regulated proteins at a 5% false discovery rate. Thus, the rule of minimum number of permuted significant pairings (MPSP) was introduced to reduce false discovery rates in combination with PLGEM-STN or a fold-change threshold. MPSP played a critical role in extending the selection of differentially regulated proteins to those with single-peptide hits or with lower fold-changes. Although the approaches were demonstrated for limited sample replicates, they should also be applicable to the situation where more sample replicates are available.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Qingbo Li"", ids = ""34703252"")",7795c2055e5f70c84006c1601ec8650455cbeb87; 5728b200ac193469d1b38a784e60044f937f70aa; 19cc7f7ee22ee383f4d0971650f09f5e1ccb5bca; 9425668cb8ff890c47902de1a96b1e64823c74b1,3ec5bbf97978397bf359430b44d49c4550d79c27; 8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92; d467ca60e8d40740925dbc631d9d16aa49777c41; f6877b0df62e6cbe559298207e4e6102e6b4bb9e; 0a2616fea7606dd83db3ece1c0fd962d78062232; d57dd6786533d877e5f8b1290843d0376ddde68a; 8b09c64adbd236ea92d753df91826b1cffedd193; d8c61f343c7384bcc0b63aaca361dd909edc32ad; 78e62d032bf7058a16a2c4879643a3a641a6f43a; 79a946a0ece2c440b46f4d5b9c34bd567ae6166a; 458e3399947df1b468bdd6f7116fb8a9c664c42a; 062692a6e0129a87cfd77ffa75396ae1cf46250f; 1da76ee81ca4c4080d590ca48d85a8c6f69c15ed; f9b78b6faeccaa2d9b807414087dec8c4949fac6; cdad2dcc54c939763af6810c58aa80f51ecd53df; 5d71e6842fb1b2c019c0008b2b57ee2c394ea162; ffaaca3d45f121ad8352dcfe0bfe0b947cf15390; 294215afe49dc052a1f310fd272acd0eb9e3313f; 9332d630c494f8a478f549be7c7ee49f3c84c9e7; e0f9470f0cf24328b41905367662b67ed38a16f2; a749231282efc1f88aca2aa6144f1aaceefcbe21; 04d62b683d0581dc4de27e2e29f727d1451042fa; c1767ccd42c0953e002a10e0a8253bba1d631709; 108d52c937c159767ee8833d1bc455e00b6c869e; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 9f85b4791323c86038f52dfae450536873d98110; c4089e6ccc6d0fff4f78ae529508d7e7a285ebec,International Journal of Proteomics,2010,
43019c2e0df72a938e1eb17668b41adfd7dce4d5,Peripheral Blood Transcriptomic Signatures of Fasting Glucose and Insulin Concentrations,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic loci associated with glycemic traits. However, characterizing the functional significance of these loci has proven challenging. We sought to gain insights into the regulation of fasting insulin and fasting glucose through the use of gene expression microarray data from peripheral blood samples of participants without diabetes in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (n = 5,056), the Rotterdam Study (RS) (n = 723), and the InCHIANTI Study (Invecchiare in Chianti) (n = 595). Using a false discovery rate q <0.05, we identified three transcripts associated with fasting glucose and 433 transcripts associated with fasting insulin levels after adjusting for age, sex, technical covariates, and complete blood cell counts. Among the findings, circulating IGF2BP2 transcript levels were positively associated with fasting insulin in both the FHS and RS. Using 1000 Genomes-imputed genotype data, we identified 47,587 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and 6,695 trans-eQTL associated with the 433 significant insulin-associated transcripts. Of note, we identified a trans-eQTL (rs592423), where the A allele was associated with higher IGF2BP2 levels and with fasting insulin in an independent genetic meta-analysis comprised of 50,823 individuals. We conclude that integration of genomic and transcriptomic data implicate circulating IGF2BP2 mRNA levels associated with glucose and insulin homeostasis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brian H Chen"", ids = ""145957540""); list(name = ""Marie-France Hivert"", ids = ""3362138""); list(name = ""Marjolein J.

30a2361a97dc14830fba29348aa862e70a36fa11,Quantitative magnetic resonance techniques in epilepsy,"Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by unprovoked recurrent seizures that give rise to episodes of abnormal neuronal activity in the central nervous system. The most common application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in the epileptic brain is the identification of the underlying cause for a personâ€™s epilepsy, and possibly the localization of the epileptic focus. In addition, quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) techniques enable examining certain relatively subtle aspects of epilepsy within the brain that go beyond the identification of seizure focus within the brain. In this thesis a number of studies are presented that investigate the application of quantitative MR techniques to epilepsy-related abnormalities of metabolism, microstructures and brain function. The research project was aimed at developing and validating quantitative MR techniques (spectroscopy, diffusion, T2 relaxometry, and functional magnetic resonance imaging) with clinical diagnostic potential. The main focus was on data acquisition and processing, and the application of this multi-modal MR approach in both patients with epilepsy and an animal model of epileptogenesis. We explored in a clinical setting how the cognitive consequences of epilepsy (either due to medication or due to seizures) may be reflected in altered MR tissue characteristics. Furthermore, using an experimental model of febrile convulsions, it was investigated whether neurological abnormalities, possibly linked with epileptogenesis and thus with epilepsy, could be detected by quantitative MR. A general introduction into quantitative MR techniques and epilepsy is given in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 describes a thorough review on absolute quantification of metabolites using spectroscopy, which can substantially improve the diagnostic utility of spectroscopy. Absolute quantification requires more time and expertise than relative quantification, as additional calibrations for concentration determination and spectrum analyses have to be performed. One can only benefit from absolute quantification if all additional reference steps are executed properly; otherwise unwanted additional errors may be introduced. Chapter 3 concerns a clinically relevant reproducibility study of several quantitative MR techniques which was performed on a 3.0 Tesla MR system. Repeated measurements in 10 healthy volunteers were used to establish the reproducibility of quantitative measures derived from different quantitative MR techniques, namely the T2 relaxation time, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the fractional anisotropy (FA), and metabolite concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), choline (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI). The reproducibility of quantitative brain MR at 3.0 T appeared to be better than, or at least comparable to the reproducibility at 1.5 T. A newly developed statistical image analysis method, which offers considerably increased sensitivity for the detection of subtle signal changes in images of several neurological MR applications, is described in Chapter 4. This method, the regional false discovery rate (FDR) control, increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. The method was validated, characterized, and compared to some other commonly used methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It was found that the new method showed considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control. Application of the method to two different neuroimaging applications, revealed substantial improvements compared to the other methods. Quantitative MR (T2 relaxation, diffusion, spectroscopy, and functional MRI) at 1.5 T and neuropsychological assessment was performed in a group of patients with localization related epilepsy and secondarily generalized tonicoclonic seizures (SGTCS) to study cognitive deterioration. Chapter 5 relates to the investigation of the effect of these seizures on microstructural and metabolic changes in brain tissue characteristics. Frontal, but not temporal, MR abnormalities were found to be related to SGTCS. These findings confirm that SGTCS do have a substantial effect on frontal brain function and on the microstructural brain tissue characteristics. This knowledge may help to obtain a better understanding and anticipatory treatment of SGTCS-related cognitive deterioration. In Chapter 6 it was investigated using functional MRI whether a higher number of SGCTS were associated with a functional reorganization of working memory. It was found that high numbers of SGTCS resulted in a decrease in intelligence scores and altered prefrontal brain activation. A shift from frontotemporal to prefrontal activation seemed to have occurred, suggesting that a functional reorganization of working memory is induced by a high number of SGTCS. It remains uncertain if this reorganization reflected compensatory mechanisms, or the underlying pathological processes of cognitive deterioration. In the same patient group it was found in Chapter 7 that the presence of a certain marker for neuronal damage in blood serum (telencephalin) correlates with a decreased frontotemporal activity during an functional MRI memory task.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jfa Jaap Jansen"", ids = ""65946937"")",,4ebd7e809ceb4e82f748a353658b3962e8244da8; 4586a5319b69d59a1f99b1a1e20607d0884e0ce4; 895a9a84665b529698ff9ad6326aebfd34d046d7; bf7b3f029cf6186dbf80ffccb9a9a92bdb303a9c; 643fa9456636b2c01ac6e66709a93ebc490a7707; ce4aec9cc6fce74ddba551e84769831edf036d85; b5caf6fc44250e6def37956ffaff5b11cbb043d9; 38b365e540b2340162c93865e5d66f445f1937a0; e4691160e1bb0e80dbc83616cd1b305bac8262f6; 5614579c199ffb5af551bf8cf731fb1d9e53a6af; 4fb3ae361bacc52aefc225b7e81a94e8b2d37346; 0df4a5cecbb557b721b84abd2ab11650a2629903; f4628ced3ae57181ec003328eb6688e11dd15736; 6a2a489d7d78bea4e6c8d6383946a3a9f23d3b0d; 545a3d88926d99b6b5666f9908c8c75e69b955eb; be9b1b61ff8b658110e4790e2c13c5566e9cb87b; 62e1266e9eff8a3a21b2c90c0c9b29a5f3954c3a; cc0ec37effda02529672384a470d9164608b8dc0; 809bc112be781ef966a13e30aa4753913723bbe4; a84bcb460cf16e329d82b9e187390ecbb9ea7632; c6646484cf19abd9eeed321ce5abc9574ff8ae11; 94b7b7105d6024bbd88e822b1707ab3ef8ead62a; 9c69d9cb3b627883d68f705cbe957cc123107e16; 7c77bd1046cc11ec7ea88eac1c44e4d463c54ce5; 3ea4dc1a55a8d9eee3976e0c13c51e5f83cf6686; 0d0fcf390edbb9bd5863a106d7d137662013c79d; 3849a21771e34136fa7f83790349aa489e48ab43; d408be14d74965c1c488a8658d3b4a722307bb92; f09e22f4d16729c997c7e21b13f37f9c1be1cb1f; b8b4300ade537cad193db87f586dccef7f68213e; 92e504e73725df5d3228dbfa6593042f056d6a64; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 2394f895e469d5adb78e5f2fde39ce69b7dd518d; 75def8b4dd4e930f3eb1ff9900c5c98d142d1195; 804d1d4f69fddec19bbd9ee96594bc0686867dfa; c3cc93d4955e2aa2a9763b1a1a77345b90894667; f3a4c60608657fbf870bef39455705f6ea0568e1; 975bee38e32bb789796eb75723a840f528892c16; cde13e5352e5c1493c6867a7db6f128e2e73dc13; 957ad71351ebacdcb2a8d2387c4bf8a90fa42a1e; 0be63f9394d6fb5c1d024fa21b33d18f3d105958; 00f78537798c7b6e2502b53650e43585f2814c0d; d731bc8928e9923d1712a8c3803197d30290443d; 207d781cdf45bf51a8d1a14cc663375693fc1dd8; 9c87a81b57d7fcef3cbf7ed6c3d8ba6341a17276; 491f13e9a8945c4b1935e573d8d7628872816408; c8964ef5a2ec4ec3a2501c3ba41ccadd4fd4d49d; 77fa683b81752a6c1f2bc962991d144696c11dc4; 2e04f2cd44e991ea2b05e966a837528dc30108f2; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; a5f06006dfad6a6e319fbd494475e6ecfa6e5a8d; 076ca7df59a006cdac7c4a1e4774a04de675d63b; 0f687945bd663140b603ee3ad7dbee41f659308e; a3676c50b3512866c183b4a597c24f59ff07f120; a1728668c20b3808509e49b5855a6012292ee212; 538efe20589eae9541b0a65d54ad5baccdb6ef54; 242f20b8bbb8becb5812f868886a6d08ba51e8a4; b18c26faacfdc79c4ea39a4a7eedbd333ea85317; c9781a9fe1de285259f7d8954bdf98accc8d248b; ffd5249260b7e1b3202040a3cfb7cb6231d0b57d; 2ab80ec8c5918a6b1cb3565ccd0a213355ebbe2b; 37912d73984e03b0ce0794caf8c9c6203cdb0354; 4f9d4f48c92d42574594e79bfea2e4928e9095e1; b1275b66d4932cbfa7321cf9c8bcc1467374439c; 5c8d81bd500421769594e61f598e8c210b53c794; a6b581cdb6160efb2a56173de3b0d7ab9b87800a,,,
eea1fa82f9330276bb59ceb3dfcfc861bec4a20c,Adaptive statistical sampling methods for decentralized estimation and detection of localized phenomena,"Sensor networks (SNETs) for monitoring spatial phenomena has emerged as an area of significant practical interest. We focus on the important problem of detection of distributed events, sources, or abnormalities that are localized, i.e., only a small number of sensors in the vicinity of the phenomena are in the field of observation. This problem complements the standard decentralized detection problem, where noisy information about an event is measured by the entire network. For localized phenomena the main difficulty arises from the coupling of: a) noisy sensor observations that lead to local false positives/negatives; and b) limited energy, which constrains communication among sensor nodes. Together these difficulties call for reaching a decentralized statistical ordering based on limited collaboration. We are then led to the following fundamental problem: determine the most probable event locations while minimizing communication cost. Our objective in this paper is to characterize the fundamental trade offs between global performance (false alarms and miss rate) and communication cost. We develop a framework to minimize the communication cost subject to worst-case misclassification constraints by making use of the false discovery rate (FDR) concept along with an optimal local measure transformation at each sensor node. The preliminary results show that the FDR concept applied in a sensor networks context leads to significant reduction in the communication cost of the system. A very interesting implication of this work is that the detection performance of a wireless sensor network is comparable to that of a wired network of sensors.",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Erhan Baki Ermis"", ids = ""1714936""); list(name = ""Venkatesh Saligrama"", ids = ""1699322"")",28c4cfd474bb459ad832127e6417a4ea1dd70eb3; ab383099574b690f7739a8ccdeda4119ff102a6c; 687b9fc008ed8f7eaff552d0af61524a925fc8a6; 69c6e764d8761e16ed21f336324c1a38639c8b9b; 81f8c2637e6ff72094a7e3a4141b5117fb19171a; 22c688240448e62bc2afd0940c7d054524590adb; f0ebf2f62a55733a5edeb16e64aa05262d2d3934; 573cffbf49069037a2fb73f671809ad2b3f0cafb; 41e9a1e0c7899860816d3f66907e3eb37fcaf19e; 3be505dd5334600338f308c9af7aba90a693f13b; 5feab1980eab2bc608e4ba9eeadca5fa1b27633b; 48cb7e827902676997b417fd1898b2c7e8469ba3; 33e80c2788113552cf5c298154564467817454a2; 2142597e698416ae9a2e5eccb56cdac60887115b; 3a51369f058f09a89f829c053262926bd3661eee; 74e62fc79282454406a922e839ad3cc3fa5a38dc; ec427d9bcd31fb4887cf7ba8c8b5360dbf5dfa74; 40035804851b3d8d70130b2c3c996ce1ec4d291f; c000e5ea4b9d378937d003169936b4fb18434935; 53e4076b9a6b306d6f9e8f57637ea7f54e43ccc0; 6281353f8d3a9733f37bf68410f1031c9e0714f0; 16a957bfff55bf73e2f92ffc5c0d302590d11f24; dc8d8a4b334af118af6c4b39b3173df394ca4a73,,,,19
71e6fe39bc8694ddbe52acc424e279e6d5f36c8c,The Effects of Experimental Manipulation of Sleep Duration on Neural Response to Food Cues,"Despite growing literature on neural food cue responsivity in obesity, little is known about how the brain processes food cues following partial sleep deprivation and whether short sleep leads to changes similar to those observed in obesity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that short sleep leads to increased reward-related and decreased inhibitory control-related processing of food cues.In a within-subject design, 30 participants (22 female, mean age = 36.7 standard deviation = 10.8 years, body mass index range 20.4-40.7) completed four nights of 6 hours/night time-in-bed (TIB; short sleep) and four nights of 9 hours/night TIB (long sleep) in random counterbalanced order in their home environments. Following each sleep condition, participants completed an fMRI scan while viewing food and nonfood images.A priori region of interest analyses revealed increased activity to food in short versus long sleep in regions of reward processing (eg, nucleus accumbens/putamen) and sensory/motor signaling (ie, right paracentral lobule, an effect that was most pronounced in obese individuals). Contrary to the hypothesis, whole brain analyses indicated greater food cue responsivity during short sleep in an inhibitory control region (right inferior frontal gyrus) and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which has been implicated in reward coding and decision-making (false discovery rate corrected q = 0.05).These findings suggest that sleep restriction leads to both greater reward and control processing in response to food cues. Future research is needed to understand the dynamic functional connectivity between these regions during short sleep and whether the interplay between these neural processes determines if one succumbs to food temptation.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kathryn E.

26c82baaeb60251cbeb2080fafb6ecfdbcb2cce1,Prevalence and Characterization of Yoga Mentions in the Electronic Health Record.,"BACKGROUND
There is a growing patient population using yoga as a therapeutic intervention, but little is known about how yoga interfaces with health care in clinical settings.


PURPOSE
To characterize how yoga is documented at a large academic medical center and to systematically identify clinician-derived therapeutic use cases of yoga.


METHODS
We designed a retrospective observational study using a yoga cohort (n = 30,976) and a demographically matched control cohort (n = 92,919) from the electronic health records at Penn Medicine between 2006 and 2016. We modeled the distribution of yoga notes among patients, clinicians, and clinical service departments, built a multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier to separate the notes by context-dependent use of the word yoga, and modeled associations between clinician recommendations to use yoga and 754 diagnostic codes with Fisher's exact test, setting an false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-value â‰¤ .05 (ie, q-value) as the significance threshold.


RESULTS
Yoga mentions in the electronic health record have increased 10.4-fold during the 10-year study period, with 2.6% of patients having at least 1 mention of yoga in their notes. In total, 30,976 patients, 2398 clinicians, and 41 clinical service departments were affiliated with yoga notes. The majority of yoga notes are in primary care. Nine diagnoses met the significance criteria for having an association with clinician recommendations to use yoga including Parkinson's disease (Odds ratio [OR], 6.3 [3.7 to 11.4]; q-value < 0.001), anxiety (OR, 5.8 [3.8 to 9.0]; q-value < 0.001), and backache (OR, 3.8 [2.4 to 6.3]; q-value = 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
There is a widespread and growing trend to include yoga as part of the clinical record. In practice, clinicians are recommending yoga as a nonpharmacological intervention for a subset of common chronic diseases.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nadia M.

4bf64845ac371dcc656b10cc3b875583a7469fde,Association of a genetic variant of the ZPR1 zinc finger gene with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Various loci and genes that confer susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD) have been identified in Caucasian populations by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). As type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for CHD, we hypothesized that certain polymorphisms may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to CHD through affecting the susceptibility to type 2 DM. The purpose of the present study was to examine a possible association of type 2 DM in Japanese individuals with 29 polymorphisms identified as susceptibility loci for CHD by meta-analyses of the GWASs. The study subjects comprised of 3,757 individuals (1,444 subjects with type 2 DM and 2,313 controls). The polymorphism genotypes were determined by the multiplex bead-based Luminex assay, which combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. To compensate for multiple comparisons of genotypes, the criterion of a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤0.05 was adopted for testing the statistical significance of the association. The comparisons of allele frequencies by the Ï‡2 test revealed that the rs964184 (Câ†’G) of the ZPR1 zinc finger gene (ZPR1) was significantly associated (P=0.0017; FDR=0.050) with type 2 DM. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender and body mass index revealed that rs964184 of ZPR1 was significantly associated (P=0.0012; odds ratio, 1.25; dominant model) with type 2 DM with the minor G allele representing a risk factor for this condition. Fasting plasma glucose levels (P=0.0076) and blood glycosylated hemoglobin contents (P=0.0132) significantly differed among ZPR1 genotypes with the G allele associated with increases in these parameters.

def1f8255fdc4b95f4d249e955295f1deb8fefb0,Epidemiological and ethical aspects of multiplex autoantibody testing.,"Arrays are one of the technologies able to detect autoantibodies by measuring simultaneously many thousands of markers from a unique biological sample. The main purpose of a diagnostic test is making an early and accurate diagnosis. From a statistical point of view, multiple testing increases the probability of false positive and false negative results. Some correction methods are available to account for this problem for instance family-wise error rate or false discovery rate. From an ethical point of view, the decision to accept or decline a test not requested has to be made autonomously. Some people may seek clarification about tests and implications of their choices. A scarcity of proven measures to reduce mortality has to be considered too. Reasons may also include avoidance of psychological harm or anxiety. Moreover, protection of confidentiality and privacy has to be respected. In conclusion, the fact that testing is optional and that surveillance advice can be offered on the basis of risk alone without a test should be discussed in the consultation. The implication of a positive test result should be discussed to make a decision about the degree to which early treatment of the condition is better than late (or no) treatment.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ettore Bidoli"", ids = ""3369168""); list(name = ""Danilo Villalta"", ids = ""5056251""); list(name = ""Michele Battistin"", ids = ""7027620""); list(name = ""Ettore Bidoli"", ids = ""3369168""); list(name = ""AdriÃ¡n Cammarota"", ids = ""115370180""); list(name = ""Miranda Ciccone"", ids = ""113927503""); list(name = ""Rafael Palhano Fedato"", ids = ""14346994""); list(name = ""Balieiro Lodi"", ids = ""116155586""); list(name = ""Federica Marchesini"", ids = ""50532876""); list(name = ""Gianludovico Molaro"", ids = ""50148182""); list(name = ""Edoardo Ostardo"", ids = ""8504718""); list(name = ""Gianluigi Rellini"", ids = ""13705898""); list(name = ""Riccardo Sartori"", ids = ""48940738""); list(name = ""Domenico Schinella"", ids = ""9797662"")",bd7949fde27d231b8219fd9973c79c67b947d3ae; a86c852c00cf6dcbbc74bde150b22e64b28c1929,,Autoimmunity reviews,6 6,"

7b903feb2577d8ad4394ff1d8f8f211711e67160,Exercise and Transversus Abdominis Muscle Atrophy after 60-d Bed Rest,"Purpose This study aimed to investigate atrophy in the deep abdominal muscles, spinal extensors, and the effect of high-load resistive exercise with and without whole-body vibration after 60 d of strict bed rest. Methods Twenty-four subjects underwent 60 d of head-down tilt bed rest and performed either resistive vibration exercise (RVE), resistive exercise only (RE), or no exercise control (2nd Berlin BedRest Study). The thickness of the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and erector spinae muscles and the area of the multifidus muscle were measured bilaterally via real-time ultrasound. Intention-to-treat analysis was implemented, and P values were adjusted by the false discovery rate method. Results At the end of the bed rest, transversus abdominis thickness was reduced by 18.3% in the inactive group (P = 0.00011) with no significant change in the RVE (âˆ’4.0%; P = 0.014 vs control) or RE (âˆ’5.0%; P = 0.10 vs control) groups. In the inactive subjects, internal oblique thickness reduced by 10.6% (P = 0.0025) and by 7% (P > 0.05) in each of the training groups. The lengthening of the lumbar spine was greatest on day 1 (+7.4%, P = 0.004) and day 2 (+6.3%, P = 0.004; day 54: +4.1%, P = 0.023). A 4.7% reduction of multifidus area was observed on day 1 of bed rest (P = 0.0049) and a 4.2% reduction of erector spinae thickness was observed on day 2 (P = 0.0011). Extensor atrophy and spinal lengthening was not affected by exercise. No significant difference was seen between RVE and RE. Conclusion Bed rest leads to atrophy of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. The exercise program, which implemented lower-limb and back extension exercises against shoulder restraints, was able to reduce atrophy seen in transversus abdominis in bed rest.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel L BelavÃ½"", ids = ""3353250""); list(name = ""Ulf Gast"", ids = ""34686036""); list(name = ""Dieter Felsenberg"", ids = ""2381379"")",4615cd86fbf0a9278a7deed0f8cb5907225d9f49; 33e0649d19b3325edd7d08b63885c229314d9dce; 75ef0eda73da2e8fca7b1009b51c6950fe072999; 237b8a3180e354277b0d5e95251200f0a212572b,b0f49805d7f4093831b2dcb0eb23f1113f629a2c; 6122b8e149e64ff183d582984707db75cfe9982c; d8e272dc36840a12d969dd1945ada5792bcc4b22; 9fbcfddc3114ddc254c34d939a7626e38bf1c88b; 109811bd00085bbb10da8da282a3e5d709bdd66e; f27449d4d2299c91655cca43f28024164dc90bf3; 83bdb5b9f164b3959132f0915239e45ada21a491; 8bfab5a3830e59823867ca5c1197f8d1b663c555; 42717a4d12a55979516b266d0b74180a2da470bb; 5f9460e9d88ab3956f30be27d85b96401ae66738; ebae9912e7bf937f597cdf58047eab59a7b7515d; 6681818437439a3863a81b27a684f8fe9074bf48; 99d89328078cbb81f66bb5915bce571d6bca11e1; 0fe530a408cb200b8072be2f13a4d9b7e668112a; bae207ae5819865b2e0e664976f7bf3af574d3c6; ccbefd00607e0fe33657659b92d986fa35bfc294; 050a59cac5720d8b11f01d667ead0f1ffc753558; 058bbdf34224f2312af58f8f6836f00da4c3ada8; bede3075e2eaf69aa80292cf3410d97c58a16b7b; 4e19f6205a9ada98f1580f6fd0f046dee5273480; e4abaea4ebc079ee041e3a7aeea02df8eac4da7b; 047fd372f3fee67a9141533c6cb0df3e1d86692c; 5712e03066ab159131a0cd5df540d9ac4cf771a4; 94c77762a108e53dd708e0af9dfd5912922480c6; c8185386fda7ed65721776d4624c5a522f5462ae; 4e051992f4bc3246e5dab775f5f72efca5aa1eea; fe0c15d546f587b2dfb383fcff555ce0210285d4; e15de541bb87c5168538d238fd443da8a56b21e3; 3e77b94c0987df279ce14ee99ad66348942cfb1e; 666b2b66e78f853bdc4ff8e9d44b4306c738ea9c; b17abd56ac4daace099bbff89fa6c47c2aca45ad; 5ebba8f90c161d6244b6963ebb2fa428ddac38e9; d75cb0397bfc7e512f174b2e1d91947070d2e725; dfda25a7fa7d717a37f8d862f4684b6dc88845b8; eb4e7a09df9e36d034b1c72aa0d6e582fe421a32; 8ce0f96f4ab3927a4ccee00b854bd734e246eb31; 725b8ce983070b559ee85785d235fe0506b1219e; 020bfc261f2d0a269541ab842bbbe470118e37bd; b3db39094cd58a3d398d7864cec5a06a8c8f76b2,Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise,49,238â€“246
f0453df6c7a6182ce9a010c18f7bd5a3646a2cf0,Grey matter hypometabolism and atrophy in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment: a two-step process.,"The pathophysiological process underlying cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease is not well understood. Cerebral atrophy and hypometabolism have been described in patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia or mild cognitive impairment with respect to control subjects. However, the exact relationships between atrophy and hypometabolism are still unclear. To determine the extension and topographical distribution of hypometabolism and atrophy in the different cognitive states of Parkinson's disease, we examined 46 patients with Parkinson's disease (19 female, 27 male; 71.7 Â± 5.9 years old; 14.6 Â± 4.2 years of disease evolution; modified Hoehn and Yahr mean stage 3.1 Â± 0.7). Cognitive status was diagnosed as normal in 14 patients, as mild cognitive impairment in 17 and as dementia in 15 patients. Nineteen normal subjects (eight female, 11 male; 68.1 Â± 3.2 years old) were included as controls. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained, co-registered, corrected for partial volume effect and spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute space in each subject. Smoothing was applied to the positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans to equalize their effective smoothness and resolution (10 mm and 12 mm full-width at half-maximum and Gaussian kernel, respectively). Z-score maps for atrophy and for hypometabolism were obtained by comparing individual images to the data set of control subjects. For each group of patients, a paired Student's t-test was performed to statistically compare the two Z-map modalities (P < 0.05 false discovery rate corrected) using the direct voxel-based comparison technique. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, hypometabolism exceeded atrophy in the angular gyrus, occipital, orbital and anterior frontal lobes. In patients with dementia, the hypometabolic areas observed in the group with mild cognitive impairment were replaced by areas of atrophy, which were surrounded by extensive zones of hypometabolism. Areas where atrophy was more extended than hypometabolism were found in the precentral and supplementary motor areas in both patients with mild cognitive impairment and with dementia, and in the hippocampus and temporal lobe in patients with dementia. These findings suggest that there is a gradient of severity in cortical changes associated with the development of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease in which hypometabolism and atrophy represent consecutive stages of the same process in most of the cortical regions affected.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rafael GonzÃ¡lez-Redondo"", ids = ""1402079878""); list(name = ""David GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""83932514""); list(name = ""Pedro Clavero"", ids = ""5914335""); list(name = ""Carmen Gasca-Salas"", ids = ""1402827522""); list(name = ""Reyes GarcÃ­a-Eulate"", ids = ""1399428208""); list(name = ""J.

6d6d90c6ca81ea2c4fff13b902f44142ec569842,The metastasis suppressor NME1 regulates expression of genes linked to metastasis and patient outcome in melanoma and breast carcinoma.,"NME1 is a well-documented metastasis suppressor gene, with suppressor activity demonstrated across a wide spectrum of human cancers including melanoma and carcinomas of the breast, stomach and thyroid. A primary aim of the current study was to identify profiles of genes whose expression is regulated by NME1 in cell lines of melanoma and thyroid carcinoma origin. Impact of NME1 was determined by forcing its expression transiently in cell lines using a novel Ad5-based adenoviral vector (Ad5-NME1), followed 48 h later by analysis of RNA expression profiles using the U133A microarray chip. Robust NME1 expression was achieved following infection with the Ad5-NME1 adenovirus in the human metastasis-derived cell lines WM1158 (melanoma) and WRO82 (follicular thyroid carcinoma), resulting in wide-ranging effects on gene expression in both settings. A substantial proportion of the NME1-regulated genes identified in the analyses were of clear potential relevance to metastasis, such as matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), SERPINB9 and colony stimulating factor receptor-2B (CSFR2B). Nine genes were identified (false discovery rate <0.1) that were regulated by NME1 in both the WM1158 and WRO82 cell lines, each possessing one or more such metastasis-relevant activities as stress fiber formation and focal adhesion (PPM1E, ZYX, PFN1), chemotaxis (CCR1) epithelial-mesenchymal signaling (WNT6), differentiation and morphogenesis (TBX4, ZFP36L2), and G protein modulation (GPR52 and PFN1). In addition, a number of the NME1-regulated genes were shown to be of prognostic value for distant disease-free survival and overall survival in melanoma and breast cancer. The combined expression of three NME1-regulated genes CSFR2B, MSF4A1 and SERPINB9 provided a strongly synergistic correlation with distant disease-free survival in the basal subtype of breast cancer (p<3.5e(-5), hazard ratio=0.33). Our study demonstrates that analysis of NME1-dependent gene expression is a powerful approach for identifying potential modulators of metastatic potential in multiple cancer types, which in turn may represent useful therapeutic targets. The study also highlights NME1-dependent genes as potential prognostic/diagnostic indices, which are profoundly lacking at present in melanoma.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""J.

688736e6aad19db4c43acbafe48e7dafad7b1318,Gene Expression in Peripheral Immune Cells following Cardioembolic Stroke Is Sexually Dimorphic,"AIMS
Epidemiological studies suggest that sex has a role in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic stroke. Since stroke is a vascular disease, identifying sexually dimorphic gene expression changes in blood leukocytes can inform on sex-specific risk factors, response and outcome biology. We aimed to examine the sexually dimorphic immune response following cardioembolic stroke by studying the differential gene expression in peripheral white blood cells.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Blood samples from patients with cardioembolic stroke were obtained at â‰¤3 hours (prior to treatment), 5 hours and 24 hours (after treatment) after stroke onset (nâ€Š=â€Š23; 69 samples) and compared with vascular risk factor controls without symptomatic vascular diseases (nâ€Š=â€Š23, 23 samples) (ANCOVA, false discovery rate pâ‰¤0.05, |fold change| â‰¥1.2). mRNA levels were measured on whole-genome Affymetrix microarrays. There were more up-regulated than down-regulated genes in both sexes, and females had more differentially expressed genes than males following cardioembolic stroke. Female gene expression was associated with cell death and survival, cell-cell signaling and inflammation. Male gene expression was associated with cellular assembly, organization and compromise. Immune response pathways were over represented at â‰¤3, 5 and 24 h after stroke in female subjects but only at 24 h in males. Neutrophil-specific genes were differentially expressed at 3, 5 and 24 h in females but only at 5 h and 24 h in males.


CONCLUSIONS
There are sexually dimorphic immune cell expression profiles following cardioembolic stroke. Future studies are needed to confirm the findings using qRT-PCR in an independent cohort, to determine how they relate to risk and outcome, and to compare to other causes of ischemic stroke.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Boryana Stamova"", ids = ""3587790""); list(name = ""Glen C.

2177627f088b50afa568a27609124b0d1be71279,The Cardiac Acetyl-Lysine Proteome,"In the heart, lysine acetylation has been implicated in processes ranging from transcriptional control of pathological remodeling, to cardioprotection arising from caloric restriction. Given the emerging importance of this post-translational modification, we used a proteomic approach to investigate the broader role of lysine acetylation in the heart using a guinea pig model. Briefly, hearts were fractionated into myofilament-, mitochondrial- and cytosol-enriched fractions prior to proteolysis and affinity-enrichment of acetylated peptides. LC-MS/MS analysis identified 1075 acetylated peptides, harboring 994 acetylation sites that map to 240 proteins with a global protein false discovery rate <0.8%. Mitochondrial targets account for 59% of identified proteins and 64% of sites. The majority of the acetyl-proteins are enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation or the TCA cycle. Within the cytosolic fraction, the enzymes of glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and lipid binding are prominent. Nuclear targets included histones and the transcriptional regulators E1A(p300) and CREB binding protein. Comparison of our dataset with three previous global acetylomic studies uniquely revealed 53 lysine-acetylated proteins. Specifically, newly-identified acetyl-proteins include Ca(2+)-handling proteins, RyR2 and SERCA2, and the myofilament proteins, myosin heavy chain, myosin light chains and subunits of the Troponin complex, among others. These observations were confirmed by anti-acetyl-lysine immunoblotting. In summary, cardiac lysine acetylation may play a role in cardiac substrate selection, bioenergetic performance, and maintenance of redox balance.

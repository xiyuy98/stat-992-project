da7d923c1554cac3e5c26b988d40ead94d1b9271,Association between kinase insert domain-containing receptor gene polymorphism and haplotypes and ischemic stroke,"BACKGROUND
Kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), a type 2 vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and vascular integrity of blood vessels. We evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotype of kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) are associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke in the Korean population.


METHODS
Totals of 501 patients with ischemic stroke and 478 controls were screened for the KDR -604T>C, +1192G>A, and +1719A>T SNPs. Subgroup analysis was performed to determine whether the effect of KDR polymorphism is specific to certain etiological subtypes of ischemic stroke. In addition, haplotype frequencies of these three SNPs were analyzed in stroke patients and controls.


RESULTS
The SNP +1719T allele was associated with risk of ischemic stroke in a dose-dependent manner (TT vs. AA: adjusted OR: 1.90, 95% CIs: 1.29-2.81, p=0.001 and false discovery rate (FDR)=0.003). Subgroup analysis showed that the SNP +1719T allele had a slight but significant association with small vessel disease type (TT vs. AA: adjusted OR: 1.91, 95% CIs: 1.11-3.29, p=0.02). There was no association between SNP -604 and SNP +1192 and ischemic stroke risk. In haplotype analysis, the T-G-T (-604/+1192/+1719), T-A-T, and C-G-T haplotypes increased the relative risk of ischemic stroke.


CONCLUSIONS
The KDR +1719A>T polymorphism and its haplotypes are possible genetic determinants for the risk of ischemic stroke.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Seung-hun Oh"", ids = ""6745502""); list(name = ""Kyung-Tae Min"", ids = ""114915129""); list(name = ""Young-Joo Jeon"", ids = ""152122506""); list(name = ""Mi-hwa Kim"", ids = ""1884732""); list(name = ""Nam-Keun Kim"", ids = ""7473359"")",a58a756c7b6ae3890506a066a5b67f6296445786; 2bf85c8fc316d8c8bf4969f8cbc86be711969cb9; cb1afe6f78cf52102acf2876e7e857cabdfa86e1; ba9105a28ee4ed7773e05dcc23b8b5344c871d89; 32a7f33bc9b1ee8fa279a81716acc88f129af947; d3951ac015f592a1a2ae658a5d148c9a5e55f210; 1f8e30ef29d98838af73cee9580b503f29bd3dd5; 79c2c4320946e73df497c4680634d97703a0e16e,9996c5cfaa56e842a03412e31686e5a7a596d56d; 26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb; b11cdce03cb82792f94f003d124584c3bd164d09; 92ac9cf0a1e010c7dca5c73540fa449e04657d2d; e8da83b5c9728a6635f5f68407cfbcf0ea6883b2; f44b16a08d0a75b528ad44dc7a8fd186fd49c901; 32a51d089584a880d95b18bca5edb6391930f7ef; 7b71c09e2a80fd2e911ab285deac5b132553a03b; 2cbe31f326fa878599e46e7107c7cec5e670bccc; 3941a055bacb6077e34c6e07f45b2f860aba09c2; 8128df0dab7575cb26be01018ab835d4bf1c220a; b6f4651796eb621567fbe54c18c8c989ad49f935; efe9124598935be6f7cf90b1e9df42e8af60848a; 2ba0eb21b070d06784b159d2fc914485fff138a3; e145de8f8c7742b73f386501c73c78557f04fb6a; 49c05654cce37426aa0b3adc1157ad4e05f854bd; 25e84ecaac5834301db3f2087fa6b9bfff0c5cbb; cd2a00c148884816bd02ab80203fa00aa676a368; 3aa06eb2c921524db10ec0579ac169988ab85645; 6c985bdb4e81479ad8b8719e5fe6b217a803cf30; cdebee2c79f4fce91c51d4d4be70e9cc60bda35a; a02331c86470775459b23e997dfd95a2dce5a104; b28e4ce3346dff95f25ce2e39f59be633a993d5e; d58927c5b234c990b3a877a8a5c089c285360d18; 81c37ec57eab6060fffbaba8da8d515c93e34036; 4722e4c82a08b8ad7e7a9dca1d3aff5bffd52b1e; 9f2227022a0c72abbbbcaeb5d446ecf4484d1d3a; f9897187785726be1740fb83e35723fdb726318d,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,308,62-66
46a7b6bcca86844d38acaef449568c66ce91c176,A comparison of imputation procedures and statistical tests for the analysis of two-dimensional electrophoresis data,"Numerous gel-based softwares exist to detect protein changes potentially associated with disease. The data, however, are abundant with technical and structural complexities, making statistical analysis a difficult task. A particularly important topic is how the various softwares handle missing data. To date, no one has extensively studied the impact that interpolating missing data has on subsequent analysis of protein spots. This work highlights the existing algorithms for handling missing data in two-dimensional gel analysis and performs a thorough comparison of the various algorithms and statistical tests on simulated and real datasets. For imputation methods, the best results in terms of root mean squared error are obtained using the least squares method of imputation along with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm approach to estimate missing values with an array covariance structure. The bootstrapped versions of the statistical tests offer the most liberal option for determining protein spot significance while the generalized family wise error rate (gFWER) should be considered for controlling the multiple testing error. In summary, we advocate for a three-step statistical analysis of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) data with a data imputation step, choice of statistical test, and lastly an error control method in light of multiple testing. When determining the choice of statistical test, it is worth considering whether the protein spots will be subjected to mass spectrometry. If this is the case a more liberal test such as the percentile-based bootstrap t can be employed. For error control in electrophoresis experiments, we advocate that gFWER be controlled for multiple testing rather than the false discovery rate.",2010,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey C.

fbd427612861efc85e1384c17e797b416cbbf3c0,Source localization approach for functional DOT using MUSIC and FDR control.,"In this paper, we formulate diffuse optical tomography (DOT) problems as a source localization problem and propose a MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm for functional brain imaging application. By providing MUSIC spectra for major chromophores such as oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR), we are able to investigate the spatial distribution of brain activities. Moreover, the false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm can be applied to control the family-wise error in the MUSIC spectra. The minimum distance between the center of mass in DOT and the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates of target regions in experiments was between approximately 6 and 18 mm, and the displacement of the center of mass in DOT and fMRI ranged between 12 and 28 mm, which demonstrate the legitimacy of the DOT-based imaging. The proposed brain mapping method revealed its potential as an alternative algorithm to monitor the brain activation.",2012,Medicine; Physics,"list(name = ""Jin Wook Jung"", ids = ""5100192""); list(name = ""Ok Kyun Lee"", ids = ""3343204""); list(name = ""Jong Chul Ye"", ids = ""2998762"")",9c7752a74a7ce9611c6f4c88c14cffbcb2a342a4; e140ce8e7c4a67bb202286e727e3f4a915003f2d,0e203d6002a7d7d116458a17ffdb37de0bc86617; cac644f37a76013a15e8c0a57ad6a0d819375f2f; 90408e730b290a90b7d02f82df47c30da82b79e0; 88a7498d16c2f47ea57c8418420e67d0ee40ad26; 8e19e8d7b40a495783aba0f5fa005048a5e78cae; 2fe838daab2ad8046519329c354a5d16a25d4b08; c26771ad7d22db288dae142fe0a892d31787cb06; f08eddcb002938bd56d04b674a73ee99015f34ac; 5e5f7b03044a218fcdf3c1e75a19cee9c0ad47b1; a3a8d41c43051f16f7c1e7b1d1c29f396d7f093b; 00bd373dd47e5a4e908b8b26b644183b071355a7; afef4296f539379a0dd7dc57abf55470753eafd8; 67b3ee563724e5b85e926d708f885d5a415586b7; 9c152d1f7507f32ad8d471fee2a74900b0fcd70c; 6e8936df71a3a4273c8a495220c77aaa730a33ea; cb526e82d3eda9c7ad100b124a928cb898683bb5; 6873bfd5547f48f22a99c0dc1313860cb66c09ad; 14b4a9baef7500a2ef80885f0ad675f3777b2490; 753e0ec80f90cc5778a31ba6d7b72dd85f3d7848; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; ee2fddf2bc9861a5110c9d604566f16ebdc41b1b; f7981cae140cadba6618a2e96df0b21b2f36becf; efa39c2b751663a437a80087098803b64b1924dd; f48dc5b431fd52b9093eb9b05e15e83f2a2ea13c; e1e8ee76c8dc42d75352718a5768c67619e85a62; 4677f15cba47c9126744f69e6a6703e946bb8795; cefcdacd42949ca687cb7e55d5311b6e6cfeeb44; f37a05f9b1a66af258ff68b2d31c91d6d17dc436; f4a45f5ac9d15171ccfa0489fa42d63a2e8bd359; d2922065d5a6c2fd5d501e66fe09bf4c4246c646; 969a129fc681381c9c30ed64a2ebb51b05ad3f67; 4213eeeadd4b28ddd99799eca48469f7957551de; e290990bcee511e6c6a7736a3981721086dcd059,Optics express,20 6,"

890a41177644e7719b7834b3bdb98b09c50b9a1d,False Discovery Rate for Wavelet-Based Statistical Parametric Mapping,"Model-based statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data relies on the general linear model and statistical hypothesis testing. Due to the large number of intracranial voxels, it is important to deal with the multiple comparisons problem. Many fMRI analysis tools utilize Gaussian random field theory to obtain a more sensitive thresholding; this typically involves Gaussian smoothing as a preprocessing step. Wavelet-based statistical parametric mapping (WSPM) is an alternative method to obtain parametric maps from non-smoothed data. It relies on adaptive thresholding of the parametric maps in the wavelet domain, followed by voxel-wise statistical testing. The procedure is conservative; it uses Bonferroni correction for strong type I error control. Yet, its sensitivity is close to SPM's due to the excellent denoising properties of the wavelet transform. Here, we adapt the false discovery rate (FDR) principle to the WSPM framework. Although explicit p-values cannot be obtained, we show that it is possible to retrieve the FDR threshold by a simple iterative scheme. We then validate the approach with an event-related visual stimulation task. Our results show better sensitivity with preservation of spatial resolution; i.e., activation clusters align well with the gray matter structures in the visual cortex.

b86d94fc3814fe021f98f4c6b459e3efe815493e,P093 : Presentation of Esx Family Proteins by Classical and Non-classical Class I Hla after M. Tuberculosis Infection,"Aim CTL responses against M. tuberculosis (Mtb) are known to be restricted primarily by HLA-B and non-classical MHC molecules such as HLA-E, CD1, and MR1. While a few Mtb derived ligands have been identified in the context of these MHC, we do not have a thorough understanding of the proteins that are sampled by HLA molecules following Mtb infection. Here we identify the Mtb proteins sampled by the non-classical class I HLA-E âˆ— 01:03 and the classical class I HLA-B âˆ— 44:02. Method Soluble HLA-E âˆ— 01:03 and HLA-B âˆ— 44:01 were harvested from Mtb (strain H37Rv) infected antigen presenting cells U373 glioblastoma cells. Peptide ligand pools from these MHC were isolated and MS spectra collected using 2-dimensional LCMS. Peptide sequences were assigned from fragment spectra analyzed with the PEAKS and Mascot algorithms using the decoy database search at a 1% False Discovery Rate. All sequences were validated with MS fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide. Results In this study we identified a total of 49 Mtb specific ligands presented by HLA. For HLA-E we found 28 ligands from 14 source proteins. In the classical class I HLA-B44, we identified 21 ligands from 8 different proteins. Strikingly, both HLA-E and HLA-B44 frequently sampled esx family proteins with 50% and 66% of the ligands originating from esx proteins for HLA-E and HLA-B44, respectively. Additionally a hypothetical protein lpq1 (Rv0237) was sampled by both HLA-E and HLA-B44. Conclusions Esx family proteins are known virulence factors for Mtb, and are highly antigenic in a natural infection. Further, esx family proteins are absent from widely used the BCG tuberculosis vaccine. Here, we found that both classical and non-classical HLA consistently sample these esx proteins further confirming their role in the adaptive immune response to Mtb.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Curtis McMurtrey"", ids = ""5002237""); list(name = ""Melanie J Harriff"", ids = ""6909313""); list(name = ""Lauren Liles"", ids = ""87448758""); list(name = ""Wilfried Bardet"", ids = ""6326833""); list(name = ""Danijela Mojsilovic"", ids = ""5795972""); list(name = ""Kenneth W.

2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59,DAGGER: A sequential algorithm for FDR control on DAGs,"We propose a linear-time, single-pass, top-down algorithm for multiple testing on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent hypotheses and edges specify a partial ordering in which hypotheses must be tested. The procedure is guaranteed to reject a sub-DAG with bounded false discovery rate (FDR) while satisfying the logical constraint that a rejected node's parents must also be rejected. It is designed for sequential testing settings, when the DAG structure is known a priori, but the $p$-values are obtained selectively (such as in a sequence of experiments), but the algorithm is also applicable in non-sequential settings when all $p$-values can be calculated in advance (such as variable/model selection). Our DAGGER algorithm, shorthand for Greedily Evolving Rejections on DAGs, provably controls the false discovery rate under independence, positive dependence or arbitrary dependence of the $p$-values. The DAGGER procedure specializes to known algorithms in the special cases of trees and line graphs, and simplifies to the classical Benjamini-Hochberg procedure when the DAG has no edges. We explore the empirical performance of DAGGER using simulations, as well as a real dataset corresponding to a gene ontology, showing favorable performance in terms of time and power.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942""); list(name = ""Jianbo Chen"", ids = ""3111284""); list(name = ""Martin J.

e8a2848e4b1c7ba249e6f226d1c9fafff49b49a0,5 Gene expression analysis and DNA methylation patterns of porcine somatic cell nuclear transfer blastocysts with high and low incidence of apoptosis,"Somatic cell NT (SCNT) efficiency remains poor, preventing the technology from being regularly used in the agricultural industry. It is believed that faulty epigenetic reprogramming of SCNT embryos leads to the low overall success. A clear apoptotic signature is associated with inappropriate gene expression and epigenomic aberrancies in many experimental cell culture systems, and we hypothesised that an apoptosis biomarker could be used to effectively separate properly reprogrammed porcine SCNT embryos from those that are destined to fail due to incomplete reprogramming. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate global gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in high- and low-apoptosis individual embryos in an effort to characterise the extent of genomic reprogramming that had taken place. Porcine SCNT blastocysts on Day 6 of development were stained with a nontoxic, noninvasive caspase activity reporter, and the top and bottom 20% of detected caspase activity were classified as high and low apoptosis, respectively (3 replicate cloning sessions; nâ€‰=â€‰13 embryos per group). Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from each individual blastocyst. The RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Ovation SoLo RNA-Seq system (NuGen, San Carlos, CA, USA). Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing libraries were prepared for DNA methylation analysis using a modification of the single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing global DNA methylation analysis approach detailed by Guo et al. (2015 Nat. Protoc. 10, 645-59). The RNA sequencing analysis using EdgeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) revealed 175 total differentially expressed genes (fold change â‰¥1.5; false discovery rate â‰¤0.05) between the high- and low-apoptosis SCNT embryos. This list of differentially expressed genes was used to perform enrichment analysis to identify overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (DAVID Ease version 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) against the Sus scrofa background genome). However, no significantly enriched GO terms or pathways were identified (false discovery rate Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Analysis of global DNA methylation patterns between high- and low-apoptosis SCNT embryos using MethylKit (Akalin et al. 2012â€‰Genome Biol. 13, R87) revealed 335 differentially methylated 100-bp regions with at least 25% difference in methylation (adjusted P â‰¤ 0.01). Gene transcription start sites associated with these regions were used for enrichment analysis; again, no significant enrichment of GO terms or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways was identified. Principal component analysis of CpG methylation showed the low-apoptosis embryos clustering more tightly than the high-apoptosis embryos, which were highly scattered. Ongoing comparisons of high- and low-apoptosis cloned embryos with naturally fertilized embryos produced inâ€‰vivo may provide more information about which embryos were properly reprogrammed. Although we are still pursuing a link between reprogramming and gene expression in high- and low-apoptosis embryos, we conclude that these data support a model of stochastic epigenetic reprogramming following SCNT and reinforce the necessity of identifying embryos most likely to be successful due to proper epigenetic reprogramming in order to increase SCNT efficiency.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""L.

74ff24c897a133c699c9bc63f5e92104c4599214,Low expression of leptin and its association with breast cancer: A transcriptomic study,"The incidence of breast cancer is alarmingly increasing worldwide and also among Saudi women. Obesity is linked with an increased cancer risk and studies have also revealed that leptin may be involved in breast tumorigenesis particularly among obese women. Numerous transcriptomic studies have been carried out worldwide; however, molecular studies among breast cancer patients of diverse ethnic groups from the Arabian Peninsula are scarce. In the present study, whole transcriptome analysis of 45Â surgically resected breast tumors from Saudi Arabian female patients was carried out. Expression data were analyzed, and molecular networks and canonical pathways were identified. We identified 1,159Â differentially expressed genes using p-value with a false discovery rate <0.05 and a fold-change >2 as a cut-off. Using ingenuity pathway analysis tool, we identified many canonical pathways that were implicated in breast cancer for the first time. Notably, along with other lipid metabolism molecules, leptin (LEP)was one of the most downregulated genes (fold cut-off,Â -7.03) with significant differences between the breast cancer and the control groups (p<0.0001) and was further confirmed in all the samples using qPCR. Transcriptomic profiling of breast cancer from a Saudi female population revealed downregulation of LEP. Molecular pathway analysis demonstrated the role of LEP and other associated molecules of the lipid metabolism pathway. Involvement of leptin and lipid metabolism in breast cancer was highlighted. The majority of cases presented were of late stage, stressing the need to educate individuals concerning early diagnostic testing and the life-style risk factors for breast cancer such as unhealthy diet and obesity.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sajjad Karim"", ids = ""39221272""); list(name = ""Adnan A.

32b5f338b69d759dc0c218eb8c93d83d03190d77,Brain morphometry changes and depressive symptoms after traumatic brain injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. Recent imaging studies on spontaneous depression have implicated several brain structures; however, few studies have done the same for post-TBI depression. We report on a pilot observational study correlating atrophy of brain regions of interest in subjects after TBI with depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Regional brain volumes were calculated on both acute and 6-month MRI using an automated segmentation algorithm (FreeSurfer). Percent volume changes in brain regions were correlated with BDI-II scores using Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the false discovery rate (FDR). Three regions of interest (left rostral anterior cingulate and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex) were found to be significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (FDR 0.05). With FDR 0.1, six regions were significantly correlated. The use of volumetric analysis of brain regions of interest to study post-TBI depression is worthy of further study. Regions associated with depressive symptoms in this pilot study were similar to those implicated in study of spontaneous depression.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anne M.

00f286b32e04fc81043de492f69e50fa9ec7dce0,Epithelial morphogenesis of MDCK cells in three-dimensional collagen culture is modulated by interleukin-8.,"Epithelial morphogenesis is dependent upon a variety of factors, many of which involve complex interactions between cells and their surrounding environments. We analyzed the patterns of differential gene expression associated with Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) renal epithelial cells grown within a collagen gel in three-dimensional (3D) culture compared with those grown atop a collagen gel in two-dimensional (2D) culture. Under these conditions, MDCK cells spontaneously formed either hollow spherical cysts or flat monolayer sheets, respectively. Microarray analysis of gene expression revealed a twofold or greater expression difference in 732 gene sets from MDCK cysts compared with monolayers (false discovery rate or FDR-adjusted P values <0.05). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) was reproducibly found to be among the genes whose expression was most dramatically upregulated, and this behavior was verified through real-time PCR analysis. The level of IL-8 protein expression was significantly increased in 3D MDCK cultures compared with that detected in cells in 2D culture. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces MDCK cells in 3D culture to form linear tubule-like structures. We found that HGF stimulation caused MDCK cells in 3D culture to decrease the expression of IL-8 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the addition of recombinant IL-8 to HGF-stimulated 3D MDCK cultures was sufficient to partially reverse the tubulogenic effects of HGF, resulting in the formation of cystic structures.

c192ff5ffcb6b296c10c201d65792cf3b6119386,An improved method for computing q-values when the distribution of effect sizes is asymmetric,"MOTIVATION
Asymmetry is frequently observed in the empirical distribution of test statistics that results from the analysis of gene expression experiments. This asymmetry indicates an asymmetry in the distribution of effect sizes. A common method for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes in a gene expression experiment while controlling false discovery rate (FDR) is Storey's q-value method. This method ranks genes based solely on the P-values from each gene in the experiment.


RESULTS
We propose a method that alters and improves upon the q-value method by taking the sign of the test statistics, in addition to the P-values, into account. Through two simulation studies (one involving independent normal data and one involving microarray data), we show that the proposed method, when compared with the traditional q-value method, generally provides a better ranking for genes as well as a higher number of truly DE genes declared to be DE, while still adequately controlling FDR. We illustrate the proposed method by analyzing two microarray datasets, one from an experiment of thale cress seedlings and the other from an experiment of maize leaves.

133e9c5e67ca82a35418f2fb8f692da3ad57aa00,Accurate quantification of circular RNAs identifies extensive circular isoform switching events,"Detection and quantification of circular RNAs (circRNAs) face several significant challenges, including high false discovery rate, uneven rRNA depletion and RNase R treatment efficiency, and underestimation of back-spliced junction reads. Here, we propose a novel algorithm, CIRIquant, for accurate circRNA quantification and differential expression analysis. By constructing pseudo-circular reference for re-alignment of RNA-seq reads and employing sophisticated statistical models to correct RNase R treatment biases, CIRIquant can provide more accurate expression values for circRNAs with significantly reduced false discovery rate. We further develop a one-stop differential expression analysis pipeline implementing two independent measures, which helps unveil the regulation of competitive splicing between circRNAs and their linear counterparts. We apply CIRIquant to RNA-seq datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma, and characterize two important groups of linear-circular switching and circular transcript usage switching events, which demonstrate the promising ability to explore extensive transcriptomic changes in liver tumorigenesis.Quantification and characterization of circRNAs in sequencing data remains challenging, hindering efforts to understand their roles and regulation. The algorithm introduced here enables accurate circRNA quantification and permits insight into competitive splicing between linear and circular isoforms.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jinyang Zhang"", ids = ""1519048570""); list(name = ""Shuai Chen"", ids = ""51501856""); list(name = ""Jingwen Yang"", ids = ""1473254668""); list(name = ""Fangqing Zhao"", ids = ""6687988"")",30989976440d3234a276a8d78e9c05c8593a11ae; 5dac0bf3f4228635458bdae0ff1fd49fb4c8de2e,75407dfa0ffc1bbfe69f52473a8d0a04a60afce2; 9ba07dacb28a24b22c26943be1b825794c827944; 30ce555813a30e220c4d1a9381c2dcfe0645303a; 2615097c06a257afc7b488147995feea06e242f3; b281fd2c97ac50707f23d094379755510cce22cd; 7eae84e9159f98424f1db6232965d752b5290c84; 6042bdb306d7797a9118480637de07645df69698; 81349542cae09420f8fc81526c8122c8d37934e2; 176490c7bbb20b5a64aca49d9dc3b75bdfd76d67; 8701435bc82840cc5f040871e3690964998e6fd3; 2d222691c3da3590775f45bd353af81609918474; f6accc4bc290c6870cc0385b397eed7001e034f7; f92a6f75c9fdfcc2da29c8359b2a701e063e5605; 3863c00d4a03475395cc1127fb4bbea12461ba51; d81719b712efae05a4fb1ccd5186c7a346428541; 6d616f2498e3e9cbb2506d332280f09e5619caae; d2fabce7e313869f39d4c6fff8bab6e463c21e9f; 1888f623e4af7c95922e67bfd439d578b1253b60; 593fbc4e512e5c119931da54f12768ab5a61fcfd; cd8d731b40b2304b61ac1ade1043fd39c5b4ab89; 4fd7e1fa3b4f6b52632bfe525d4051e23bcf2bb8; 451bcef91df96e6d1d014ddeae0e524d7d1a57d0; 428b62ddcf113d049fb8b326566915f3a6de1911; 3b3eed51760cb1bce42ff7a984608479f65c8b21; 9fbb4a5ea619d2a8334edf8f7aed9a795740b845; 295c4beae25db067d641850754e9dee99dbbcbcb; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 12b81cd81d5f1c4263518717a0fe9be7d3301900; 610c2dc251fc3c4b80fb0e566014c979441a2946; cf3c6dca53aa4b0926c2283f22f04a6c0bc3b96d; 168f28ac3c8c7ea63bf7ed25f2288e8b67e2fe74; 1a6e4d210b4a4b949bc275327a81796db4b4bcd5; b4a0c400ebd183ca4e88cf17767fa22ed85ae612; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; 9ee5a41ce9bfd29f32203e4844beb03e91f12f22; d20c7906ac1956b58fd21fedc350fb109385b6ef; 0a24558a4ad6f6f9f1f8ddacbfc04773c18818a7; 405e441f36ed3fb03b58f8ac52014a1e148daa70; d21a242c71e5bd57daa30583360b74803cffaeef; aa253a125fc4f513c44b022fcc11be5ceab34a67; ee557a7f8fbba89deeaa8795bacdaed5a2da483f; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 74574ee09030e8aadb48fa349eb9b054e2f95ceb; e85e68862dd0eed5ebe900c2721a2dfb1c237c9f; 8a0bb73c85ee700e26f0daec1bb218e4d9b1414e; 19f835433a0730d5adbe601729c563f0c13fdac4; 61d3ee2ffb35b66d7a0f3f3bce2439074c1751ce; a4207963c3b8d8a7de4eec16cf8a808d0e0e80a6,Nature Communications,11,
223c33b1692c268034170e3fe14612ddb20386e3,Genomic alterations of chromosome region 11p as predictive marker by array comparative genomic hybridization in lung adenocarcinoma patients.,"Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a method to quantitatively measure the changes of DNA copy number with an extremely high resolution and to map them directly onto the complete linear genome sequences. In this study, we used aCGH to compare genomic alterations in fresh-frozen lung cancer tissues of 21 adenocarcinomas (AdCCs) (11 early relapse and 10 nonrelapse) and identified genomic alterations that showed significant by different frequency between early relapse and nonrelapse AdCCs. Twelve clones were identified by the false discovery rate (FDR) test, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were selected as predictive markers. The significant gain clones were found in 11p (11p15.4, 11p15.1, and 11p13). When the cutoff value was 2, study of the association between candidate clones and relapse prediction revealed that early relapse and nonrelapse groups were most effectively separated. To further validate the gain of chromosome 11p region that was identified by array CGH, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed. To further confirm the results of aCGH, copy number changes of cancer-related candidate genes in AdCC patients were compared by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Array CGH and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data were found to correspond to delineated DNA copy number changes. Genomic alterations of chromosome 11p region in AdCC patients were observed with aCGH, and a relapsable marker was identified in the nonrelapse group. This marker could be useful in stratifying patient groups according to likelihood of relapse for adjuvant treatment after surgical resection.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jae Sook Sung"", ids = ""2467410""); list(name = ""Kyong Hwa Park"", ids = ""4618365""); list(name = ""Yeul Hong Kim"", ids = ""3235490"")",2ce9b41721e0a889b3993512dab0982a247c52c3; 25ff90ba82552af506e4e7ac7fd62886006ef68e; 8aac2f16a8e7eddd4741ed7875e8dfefbd58a583; 9abcfc955a111b83c66b9f184faf98d5c110eb17; ba36201d99040f451ebdb89cafb3ec64634429b4; 059a9b055a661f94458ba0aa5506b4d0c3d92102,,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,198 1,"

235f50fb172aa65995188094c95c7c9daff9fc7f,Large improvements in MS/MS-based peptide identification rates using a hybrid analysis.,"We report a hybrid search method combining database and spectral library searches that allows for a straightforward approach to characterizing the error rates from the combined data. Using these methods, we demonstrate significantly increased sensitivity and specificity in matching peptides to tandem mass spectra. The hybrid search method increased the number of spectra that can be assigned to a peptide in a global proteomics study by 57-147% at an estimated false discovery rate of 5%, with clear room for even greater improvements. The approach combines the general utility of using consensus model spectra typical of database search methods with the accuracy of the intensity information contained in spectral libraries. A common scoring metric based on recent developments linking data analysis and statistical thermodynamics is used, which allows the use of a conservative estimate of error rates for the combined data. We applied this approach to proteomics analysis of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, a cyanobacterium that is a model organism for studies of photosynthetic carbon fixation and biofuels development. The increased specificity and sensitivity of this approach allowed us to identify many more peptides involved in the processes important for photoautotrophic growth.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""William R.

fc155a9faf9e89038d3ef3c58063459982785187,Inflammatory gene networks in term human decidual cells define a potential signature for cytokine-mediated parturition.,"BACKGROUND
Inflammation is a proximate mediator of preterm birth and fetal injury. During inflammation several microRNAs (22 nucleotide noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules) are up-regulated in response to cytokines such as interleukin-1Î². MicroRNAs, in most cases, fine-tune gene expression, including both up-regulation and down-regulation of their target genes. However, the role of pro- and antiinflammatory microRNAs in this process is poorly understood.


OBJECTIVE
The principal goal of the work was to examine the inflammatory genomic profile of human decidual cells challenged with a proinflammatory cytokine known to be present in the setting of preterm parturition. We determined the coding (messenger RNA) and noncoding (microRNA) sequences to construct a network of interacting genes during inflammation using an in vitro model of decidual stromal cells.


STUDY DESIGN
The effects of interleukin-1Î² exposure on mature microRNA expression were tested in human decidual cell cultures using the multiplexed NanoString platform, whereas the global inflammatory transcriptional response was measured using oligonucleotide microarrays. Differential expression of select transcripts was confirmed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. Bioinformatics tools were used to infer transcription factor activation and regulatory interactions.


RESULTS
Interleukin-1Î² elicited up- and down-regulation of 350 and 78 nonredundant transcripts (false discovery rate < 0.1), respectively, including induction of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. Whereas this transcriptional response included marked changes in several microRNA gene loci, the pool of fully processed, mature microRNA was comparatively stable following a cytokine challenge. Of a total of 6 mature microRNAs identified as being differentially expressed by NanoString profiling, 2 (miR-146a and miR-155) were validated by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. Using complementary bioinformatics approaches, activation of several inflammatory transcription factors could be inferred downstream of interleukin-1Î² based on the overall transcriptional response. Further analysis revealed that miR-146a and miR-155 both target genes involved in inflammatory signaling, including Toll-like receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.


CONCLUSION
Stimulation of decidual cells with interleukin-1Î² alters the expression of microRNAs that function to temper proinflammatory signaling. In this setting, some microRNAs may be involved in tissue-level inflammation during the bulk of gestation and assist in pregnancy maintenance.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sherrine A Ibrahim"", ids = ""49809386""); list(name = ""William E.

8fcafe1a6403b3fdd2fa2ab03803d4d421dc3115,Polymorphisms in key pulmonary inflammatory pathways and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"PURPOSE/AIM
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an important clinical and public health problem. Why some at-risk individuals develop ARDS and others do not is unclear but may be related to differences in inflammatory and cell signaling systems. The Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) and Granulocyte-Monocyte Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) pathways have recently been implicated in pulmonary pathophysiology; whether genetic variation within these pathways contributes to ARDS risk or outcome is unknown.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We studied 842 patients from three centers in Utah and 14 non-Utah ARDS Network centers. We studied patients at risk for ARDS and patients with ARDS to determine whether Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RAGE and GM-CSF pathways were associated with development of ARDS. We studied 29 SNPs in 5 genes within the two pathways and controlled for age, sepsis as ARDS risk factor, and severity of illness, while targeting a false discovery rate of â‰¤ 5%. In a secondary analysis we evaluated associations with mortality.


RESULTS
Of 842 patients, 690 had ARDS, and 152 were at-risk. Sepsis was the risk factor for ARDS in 250 (30%) patients. When controlling for age, APACHE III score, sepsis as risk factor, and multiple comparisons, no SNPs were significantly associated with ARDS. In a secondary analysis, only rs743564 in CSF2 approached significance with regard to mortality (OR 2.17, unadjusted p = 0.005, adjusted p = 0.15).


CONCLUSIONS
Candidate SNPs within 5 genes in the RAGE and GM-CSF pathways were not significantly associated with development of ARDS in this multi-centric cohort.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Samuel M.

6d0fc71088800aaf880a24812e50fef0063c86ce,"CAPN3, DCT, MLANA and TYRP1 are overexpressed in skin of vitiligo vulgaris Mexican patients","Vitiligo is a disorder causing skin depigmentation, in which several factors have been proposed for its pathogenesis: Environmental, genetic and biological aspects of melanocytes, even those of the surrounding keratinocytes. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms has complicated the task of predicting the development and progression. The present study used microarray analysis to characterize the transcriptional profile of skin from Vitiligo Vulgaris (VV) patients and the identified transcripts were validated using targeted high-throughput RNA sequencing in a broader set of patients. For microarrays, mRNA was taken from 20 skin biopsies of 10 patients with VV (pigmented and depigmented skin biopsy of each), and 5 biopsies of healthy subjects matched for age and sex were used as a control. A signature was identified that contains the expression pattern of 722 genes between depigmented vitiligo skin vs. healthy control, 1,108 between the pigmented skin of vitiligo vs. healthy controls and 1,927 between pigmented skin, depigmented vitiligo and healthy controls (P<0.05; false discovery rate, <0.1). When comparing the pigmented and depigmented skin of patients with vitiligo, which reflects the real difference between both skin types, 5 differentially expressed genes were identified and further validated in 45 additional VV patients by RNA sequencing. This analysis showed significantly higher RNA levels of calpain-3, dopachrome tautomerase, melan-A and tyrosinase-related protein-1 genes. The data revealed that the pigmented skin of vitiligo is already affected at the level of gene expression and that the main differences between pigmented and non-pigmented skin are explained by the expression of genes associated with pigment metabolism.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mauricio Salinas-Santander"", ids = ""1413650960""); list(name = ""Victor TreviÃ±o"", ids = ""2002690""); list(name = ""Eduardo de la Rosa-Moreno"", ids = ""1422215963""); list(name = ""BÃ¡rbara Verduzco-Garza"", ids = ""1422200218""); list(name = ""Celia Nohemi Sanchez-Dominguez"", ids = ""1401575239""); list(name = ""Cristina CantÃº-Salinas"", ids = ""1421929926""); list(name = ""Jorge Ocampo-Garza"", ids = ""1398633322""); list(name = ""Armando Lagos-RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""1422188992""); list(name = ""J Ocampo-Candiani"", ids = ""1398090052""); list(name = ""Rocio Ortiz-LÃ³pez"", ids = ""1388900001"")",125ebe2eb66dedfc8e85cc850858ea8bd5a0c868,7fbcb74a6f994f85986a2fa26c4bb13f90e0eea4; edaebbb1ca36a373d66d01d95b52b18c4d4d9b9a; 41d3c76a039de08e7b0d2eb9121c65b99d51341d; 0ee8caa0adc31c6e499b901a5ac18a027976606a; 088e45c5bac442d5ef81fd81008760acdbfd1237; c8944d619c521c745797cd0d94febfbdef2a83d4; c46557cf7f138436299b462180f07eaaa9af92f7; 1f02d95dd8929d6bb13beb395239fa626fc3b822; 9779dc8f8eeca49e94013a445634ea598a90b0a9; e2fa464e24b462afc1ee54ae963f068bd3b743d5; 0c6b71a88bc10a04a7e4185efa524f141b3ff16c; 1987447992a2aebf4003939e3db8869745e6b762; 04ee7d2bd1127589b93b61bbc61f6fc5ea141dec; a462fcd528d0f1a928df3faed65bbf3390ea4efc; 8050f3f88a31f54f38ba94cf88dfc4318a50a746; 4ca488b0a57773adc4a85eb0527319aaf86e7756; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 91d4ed82e7a918bfee47cc0bac6ebdedc20f37a9; 58ebcefad857c82195a57a1e66dd2f97bba4a6e1; 501d22c1bb26d7a50c5bd1fccdaf168a26dc4f4a; 2aa48e1d2e7ac35d26cd74063bf7987c54e4c1b3; cbc6568620c52becef8c31c881a6ce336f4f46c1; a2bf7be1ecb0caca89a02cbb1ebf73ab42c6aafd; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c486dbc92b2c0a95887655371de81280aa9b6339; 78fbd7d3c45828f0712843a675203d42606416f9; 06bd0a5b508519405a696742b00316f77a655b9d; fe04559b54057cfc06e2679e5d4847788319bf3c; b53d98ca21b5f119eccac16401ef415e86ae7388; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; cba35b1a1f6b6b32520aa566382e7b6e30cf830a; a7dca2f166d7ff2eb9d101ded5ed1c66c3916901; 75b8bf3156f8470555190d92662347f7506c3b29; d16c98e4ddb13f6cc8903385af1d4764de09f01b; c923682b25da6aa67c24fb256a817c73ccc7dda1; ffb62f262a53f8291a4ff068d831655af1e6e9fd; b7380d97cd50f9dfad3449cccc8616da9c1ae349; 0ff8cbdbd3b27914ff2181156a5f1c2c2ed530df; 4d182457ded38dac5b25352055acbb29e6c7d2f6; 40fb5834190d85bbb6be607fca6d1dcbe0cb154c; bcb295dd6061c6c8a96fd12678185d82191106f2; 39317b82d379cb581be311d9a9fd41a00ba66360; b4cace3122a936abccb59594db752adee02c98dc; 50624c1871fd8b68a69813319550332ca1ed7301,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,15,2804 - 2811
8fde4e634e968019018732c3857699a22feb021d,The problem with peptide presumption and low Mascot scoring.,"Mascot, a database-search algorithm, is used to deduce an amino acid sequence from a peptide tandem mass spectrum. The magnitude of the Ions score associated with each peptide mostly reflects the extent of b-y ion matching in a collision-induced dissociation spectrum. Recently, several studies have reported peptides identified with abnormally low Ions scores. While a majority of the spectra in these studies may be correctly assigned, low-scoring spectra could lack discernible b-y ion fragments needed to clearly delineate a peptide sequence. It appears that low-scoring identification may be predicated primarily on judgmental parent ion mass accuracy and that justification to include such low-scoring peptides may be based on inaccurate false discovery rate modeling. It is likely that additional scientific experimentation is needed or appropriate methodologies adopted before substandard fragment ion matching can be considered proof of peptide identification.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bret Cooper"", ids = ""36777276"")",6be22dab1cedf4e9d421ce6371ede3af69e0d87b; 35a7908e590d13bc1c9547c61e6c106a39880d35; 3804d9bf8cf4465c43ebde566bd87e2e3fddfd63; 2e98f9af061411a789810a453233ce8d471d6662; 5df43a5e2b587d7a556b50073b30d19af88ec4fe; f713abef16fda8623ee14b48e31a8c212ece1606; 185b2de694451d9f573a98e697eba6c250f15972; 999c47ce6dba6cb55550d7b04e0deeb531ea24aa; aca4a6db3d647336cb4b2cb8bfca7fe2aa482de3; 697481eaa72510a3d0035d44c9049a1be0efca9d; ee71c3b0f0b3c30c75d7f414ed986eae7c86d65c; 1cc3470dbdf68379bc1837a1b76e960f3dba6288; 22659db8fec77f90c4e8792b8f2859feb4956b8e; 461709a2f4d5cb87db5b15d5c6cc8920d8b9f69f; cf24c819d5bb518bdce05aca32a2d42aa2cc99b7,6691a468ca4926098c71a1034d4abc346c2a12c4; 8e064c35b25e8682c5ca061ebb4d339e91ccf799; 6977b9cb8225f3235c515cd40d4201cc41c4c489; 0df52c6ff7640abdc179e8f7ed9532fc86b0d26d; 2bdbd53ae48d92be98ea00fd7550189d3ca53ce6; 6088ae4794d3ac35d3576ede803b9212662ba8bb; 3848d9f7d053c3f540f264efa3f51995dcf78dcb; 4af86feb17671a90eaa261a37b41ac5178941986; ca1ed8fd9ba9683108d7cf61ef31aff50b2eb293; cb84bccc93b19f5b90cfe8e719fe67e4db0c5149; 31e5333af66e56b4c4a085a89af15fc317242fca; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 582a8fc085629efbae206e0ffb1697db856435e7; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121,Journal of proteome research,10 3,"

To investigate the association of gastric cancer with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (COMT, CYP1B1, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, HSD17B1 and SHBG) involved in estrogen and androgen synthesis and metabolism, 58 haplotype-tagging SNPs were genotyped in 295 gastric cancer cases and 415 controls from a population-based study in Poland. We assessed differences in haplotype frequency between cases and controls using a global score test and calculated multivariate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individual haplotypes using logistic regression. We found associations in one linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing the 3' untranslated region of COMT (rs9332377, rs165728, rs165849 and rs1110478), global score test (df = 4, P = 0.033). Relative to the most frequent GATA haplotype, the GATG haplotype was associated with statistically significant increased gastric cancer risk (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.06-2.12; false discovery rate (FDR) value = 0.459) and the AACA haplotype with borderline increased risk (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.00-1.85; FDR = 0.50). We also found associations for the LD block containing part of the SHBG coding region (rs6258, rs6259, rs2955617, rs1641544 and rs1641537). The CACCC haplotype was associated with statistically significant lower gastric cancer risk relative to the referent CGACC haplotype (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.34-0.90; FDR = 0.459), but the overall score test was statistically non-significant. No other statistically significant associations were observed. In summary, we found possible associations between gastric cancer and polymorphisms in COMT, involved in estrogen inactivation, and SHBG, a modulator of hormone bioavailability.

7f06d26a60ed78e78a6cbb61c0b75b45cf768ac0,Genetic variants of PDGF signaling pathway genes predict cutaneous melanoma survival,"To investigate whether genetic variants of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway genes are associated with survival of cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients, we assessed associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PDGF pathway with melanoma-specific survival in 858 CM patients of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Additional data of 409 cases from Harvard University were also included for further analysis. We identified 13 SNPs in four genes (COL6A3, NCK2, COL5A1 and PRKCD) with a nominal P < 0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2 in MDACC dataset. Based on linkage disequilibrium, functional prediction and minor allele frequency, a representative SNP in each gene was selected. In the meta-analysis using MDACC and Harvard datasets, there were two SNPs associated with poor survival of CM patients: rs6707820 C>T in NCK2 (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.35-2.59, Pmeta= 1.53E-5); and rs2306574 T>C in PRKCD (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.33-2.24, Pmeta= 4.56E-6). Moreover, CM patients in MDACC with combined risk genotypes of these two loci had markedly poorer survival (HR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.58-3.84, P < 0.001). Genetic variants of rs6707820 C>T in NCK2 and rs2306574 T>C in PRKCD of the PDGF signaling pathway may be biomarkers for melanoma survival.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hong Li"", ids = ""46382474""); list(name = ""Yanru Wang"", ids = ""2604876""); list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Qiong Shi"", ids = ""5325951""); list(name = ""Hongyu Li"", ids = ""1682162""); list(name = ""Wenting Wu"", ids = ""1791304""); list(name = ""Dakai Zhu"", ids = ""49281897""); list(name = ""Christopher I.

8e95808c44274a4330b7ea52d545d63c9ccedd93,A review of methods for interpretation of glycopeptide tandem mass spectral data,"Despite the publication of several software tools for analysis of glycopeptide tandem mass spectra, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the most effective and appropriate methods. In part, this reflects problems with applying standard methods for proteomics database searching and false discovery rate calculation. While the analysis of small post-translational modifications (PTMs) may be regarded as an extension of proteomics database searching, glycosylation requires specialized approaches. This is because glycans are large and heterogeneous by nature, causing glycopeptides to exist as multiple glycosylated variants. Thus, the mass of the peptide cannot be calculated directly from that of the intact glycopeptide. In addition, the chemical nature of the glycan strongly influences product ion patterns observed for glycopeptides. As a result, glycopeptidomics requires specialized bioinformatics methods. We summarize the recent progress towards a consensus for effective glycopeptide tandem mass spectrometric analysis.",2015,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Han Hu"", ids = ""145030937""); list(name = ""Kshitij Khatri"", ids = ""9186309"");

b0b6289a0bb2bffba0f063a38269cb25dac95f3c,MicroRNA Profiling of BRCA1/2 Mutation-Carrying and Non-Mutation-Carrying High-Grade Serous Carcinomas of Ovary,"BACKGROUND
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are 20 approximately 25 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that inhibit the translation of targeted mRNA, and they have been implicated in the development of human malignancies. High grade serous ovarian carcinomas, the most common and lethal subtype of ovarian cancer, can occur sporadically or in the setting of BRCA1/2 syndromes. Little is known regarding the miRNA expression profiles of high grade serous carcinoma in relation to BRCA1/2 status, and compared to normal tubal epithelium, the putative tissue of origin for high grade serous carcinomas.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Global miRNA expression profiling was performed on a series of 33 high grade serous carcinomas, characterized with respect to BRCA1/2 status (mutation, epigenetic silencing with loss of expression or normal), and with clinical follow-up, together with 2 low grade serous carcinomas, 2 serous borderline tumors, and 3 normal fallopian tube samples, using miRNA microarrays (328 human miRNA). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on miRNA expression profiles showed no clear separation between the groups of carcinomas with different BRCA1/2 status. There were relatively few miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the genotypic subgroups. Comparison of 33 high grade serous carcinomas to 3 normal fallopian tube samples identified several dysregulated miRNAs (false discovery rate <5%), including miR-422b and miR-34c. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis performed on selected miRNAs confirmed the pattern of differential expression shown by microarray analysis. Prognostically, lower level miR-422b and miR-34c in high grade serous carcinomas were both associated with decreased disease-specific survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
High grade serous ovarian carcinomas with and without BRCA1/2 abnormalities demonstrate very similar miRNA expression profiles. High grade serous carcinomas as a group exhibit significant miRNA dysregulation in comparison to tubal epithelium and the levels of miR-34c and miR-422b appear to be prognostically important.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cheng Han Lee"", ids = ""49010596""); list(name = ""Subbaya Subramanian"", ids = ""21822367""); list(name = ""Andrew H.

1df9af25408c3612fcce188bb451a93fbe117ccb,DNA Methylation and All-Cause Mortality in Middle-Aged and Elderly Danish Twins,"Several studies have linked DNA methylation at individual CpG sites to aging and various diseases. Recent studies have also identified single CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, we perform an epigenome-wide study of the association between CpG methylation and mortality in a population of 435 monozygotic twin pairs from three Danish twin studies. The participants were aged 55-90 at the time of blood sampling and were followed for up to 20 years. We validated our results by comparison with results from a British and a Swedish cohort, as well as results from the literature. We identified 2806 CpG sites associated with mortality (false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 0.05 ), of which 24 had an association p-value below 10 - 7 . This was confirmed by intra-pair comparison controlling for confounding effects. Eight of the 24 top sites could be validated in independent datasets or confirmed by previous studies. For all these eight sites, hypomethylation was associated with poor survival prognosis, and seven showed monozygotic correlations above 35%, indicating a potential moderate to strong heritability, but leaving room for substantial shared or unique environmental effects. We also set up a predictor for mortality using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression.

We hypothesized that liverâ€™s response to the process where large droplets of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells is reflected also in gene pathway expression in blood. Peripheral blood genome wide gene expression analysis and ultrasonic imaging of liver were performed for 1,650 participants (316 individuals with FL and 1,334 controls) of the Young Finns Study. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed for the expression data. Fourteen gene sets were upregulated (false discovery rate, FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in subjects with FL. These pathways related to extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, immune response regulation, prothrombotic state and neural tissues. After adjustment for known risk factors and biomarkers of FL, we found i) integrin A4B1 signaling, ii) leukocyte transendothelial migration, iii) CD40/CD40L and iv) netrin-1 signaling pathways to be upregulated in individuals with FL (nominal pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). From these all but not ii) remained significantly upregulated when analyzing only subjects without history of heavy alcohol use.

cabd8aa9a7b78307b3f85428088ada2a030cbcd1,Common hemostasis and inflammation gene variants and venous thrombosis in older adults from the Cardiovascular Health Study.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
Age-related changes in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis are associated with increased risk of thrombotic events. Inherited deficiencies of coagulation proteins, such as factor V (FV) Leiden and prothrombin G20210A, explain a small fraction of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). Additional genetic factors are likely to underlie the etiology of VTE, some of which may become manifest at older ages.


METHODS
We tested 290 common SNPs within 51 thrombosis and inflammation genes for association with VTE in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a large, prospective cohort of older adults followed for up to 12 years.


RESULTS
There were 184 VTE events that occurred at mean age of 78 years. TagSNPs within four genes encoding FXIII subunit A (F13A), FVII activating protease (HABP2), protease activated receptor-1 (F2R) and the urokinase receptor (PLAUR) showed the strongest evidence for association with VTE, with each gene having a global P-value < 0.05 and at least one tagSNP false discovery rate (FDR) q-value < 0.05. The rs3024409 variant allele of F13A1 was associated with 1.66-fold increased risk of VTE, while the minor alleles of HABP2 rs6585234 and rs3862019, F2R rs253061 and rs153311, and PLAUR rs344782 were each associated with lower risk of VTE (hazard ratios in the range of 0.49-0.66). Consistent with the observed protective association for VTE risk, the HABP2 rs3862019 variant allele was also associated with lower activity levels of coagulation factors FVIII, FIX, FX and plasminogen. We also confirm previously reported associations between common variants of the coagulation FII, FV, FVIII, FXI, alpha-fibrinogen and protein C genes and risk of VTE.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest that several novel common coagulation gene variants may be related to risk of VTE in older adults. Further studies in older adults are needed to validate these findings and assess functional molecular mechanisms.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander P.

e8352a40545d5367ab859a3ab17d286f2f578260,Improving sensitivity of linear regression-based cell type-specific differential expression deconvolution with per-gene vs. global significance threshold,"BackgroundThe goal of many human disease-oriented studies is to detect molecular mechanisms different between healthy controls and patients. Yet, commonly used gene expression measurements from blood samples suffer from variability of cell composition. This variability hinders the detection of differentially expressed genes and is often ignored. Combined with cell counts, heterogeneous gene expression may provide deeper insights into the gene expression differences on the cell type-specific level.Published computational methods use linear regression to estimate cell type-specific differential expression, and a global cutoff to judge significance, such as False Discovery Rate (FDR). Yet, they do not consider many artifacts hidden in high-dimensional gene expression data that may negatively affect linear regression. In this paper we quantify the parameter space affecting the performance of linear regression (sensitivity of cell type-specific differential expression detection) on a per-gene basis.ResultsWe evaluated the effect of sample sizes, cell type-specific proportion variability, and mean squared error on sensitivity of cell type-specific differential expression detection using linear regression. Each parameter affected variability of cell type-specific expression estimates and, subsequently, the sensitivity of differential expression detection. We provide the R package, LRCDE, which performs linear regression-based cell type-specific differential expression (deconvolution) detection on a gene-by-gene basis. Accounting for variability around cell type-specific gene expression estimates, it computes per-gene t-statistics of differential detection, p-values, t-statistic-based sensitivity, group-specific mean squared error, and several gene-specific diagnostic metrics.ConclusionsThe sensitivity of linear regression-based cell type-specific differential expression detection differed for each gene as a function of mean squared error, per group sample sizes, and variability of the proportions of target cell (cell type being analyzed). We demonstrate that LRCDE, which uses Welchâ€™s t-test to compare per-gene cell type-specific gene expression estimates, is more sensitive in detecting cell type-specific differential expression at Î±â€‰<â€‰0.05 missed by the global false discovery rate threshold FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.3.",2016,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Edmund R.

6260ed47e9a52c27d11b766327d0f0cc3a7c9c42,FastLSU: a more practical approach for the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR controlling procedure for huge-scale testing problems,"MOTIVATION
We address a common problem in large-scale data analysis, and especially the field of genetics, the huge-scale testing problem, where millions to billions of hypotheses are tested together creating a computational challenge to control the inflation of the false discovery rate. As a solution we propose an alternative algorithm for the famous Linear Step Up procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg.


RESULTS
Our algorithm requires linear time and does not require any P-value ordering. It permits separating huge-scale testing problems arbitrarily into computationally feasible sets or chunks Results from the chunks are combined by our algorithm to produce the same results as the controlling procedure on the entire set of tests, thus controlling the global false discovery rate even when P-values are arbitrarily divided. The practical memory usage may also be determined arbitrarily by the size of available memory.

fa3c9c05ff6835ee24ebf79c95ff35abb593cf57,Stopping rules for mutual information-based feature selection,"Abstract In recent years feature selection methods based on mutual information have attracted a significant attention. Most of the proposed methods are based on sequential forward search which add at each step a feature which is most relevant in explaining a class variable when considered together with the already chosen features. Such procedures produce ranking of features ordered according to their relevance. However significant limitation of all existing methods is lack of stopping rules which separate relevant features placed on the top of the ranking list from irrelevant ones. Finding an appropriate stopping rule is particularly important in domains where one wants to precisely determine the set of features affecting the class variable and discard the irrelevant ones (e.g. in genome-wide association studies the goal is to precisely determine mutations in DNA affecting the disease). In this work we propose stopping rules which are based on distribution of approximation of conditional mutual information given that all relevant features have been already selected. We show that the distribution is approximately chi square with appropriate number of degrees of freedom provided features are discretized into moderate number of bins. The proposed stopping rules are based on quantiles of the distribution and related p-values which are compared with thresholds used in multiple hypothesis testing. Importantly the proposed methods do not require additional validation data and are independent from the classifier. The extensive simulation experiments indicate that the rules separate relevant features from the irrelevant ones. We show experimentally that Positive Selection Rate (fraction of features correctly selected as relevant with respect to all relevant features) approaches 1, when sample size increases. At the same time, False Discovery Rate (fraction of irrelevant features selected with respect to all selected features) is controlled. The experiments on 17 benchmark datasets indicate that the classification models, built on features selected by the proposed methods, in 13 cases achieve significantly higher accuracy than the models based on all available features.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jan Mielniczuk"", ids = ""144134946""); list(name = ""PaweÅ‚ Teisseyre"", ids = ""31945970"")",,,Neurocomputing,358,255-274
c558db26fcd4ea18d07a6a67203f6bf7b88b7cdb,Two-Sample Tests for High-Dimensional Linear Regression with an Application to Detecting Interactions.,"Motivated by applications in genomics, we consider in this paper global and multiple testing for the comparisons of two high-dimensional linear regression models. A procedure for testing the equality of the two regression vectors globally is proposed and shown to be particularly powerful against sparse alternatives. We then introduce a multiple testing procedure for identifying unequal coordinates while controlling the false discovery rate and false discovery proportion. Theoretical justifications are provided to guarantee the validity of the proposed tests and optimality results are established under sparsity assumptions on the regression coefficients. The proposed testing procedures are easy to implement. Numerical properties of the procedures are investigated through simulation and data analysis. The results show that the proposed tests maintain the desired error rates under the null and have good power under the alternative at moderate sample sizes. The procedures are applied to the Framingham Offspring study to investigate the interactions between smoking and cardiovascular related genetic mutations important for an inflammation marker.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yin Xia"", ids = ""49289914""); list(name = ""Tianxi Cai"", ids = ""2271618""); list(name = ""Tengfei Cai"", ids = ""49282956"")",6de25f28f84c031d066466e04576b7038b85a403; 55bb78222ba349c7416f42529485f8c829c4f38a; 6f0babac6ec9c2c0f12e5dd8997efbc739bff3bf; e576415557f8fa16205b682eef79bd63e258af74; e7f28bdce400e54dadc0aa1e0e84b2b17b95754b,94335cd30c43db04d92accd13fbde572a5478495; 4b97a1e2fe438a8c48aa8f42241b24040b189f60; 137d2d17d56cdf586c186d600abccbf2d0555021; 97a3dad39601246bb779eaecf178564d986cfe55; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; 1f1b750baf5b0fa427c5b38379cdcc8d70634d36; 6f4097a0c762c057a29b37977f5eeacb24d47fe9; 2c0e12329e20a0e67ca985d464167bee8a44f470; 5a91932840a0a20c323baaf7e097ac7a2a71ff10; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 9f777ae99c3fcc87cad3d099d66f069d5982b0f1; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 8921dfcc2df4606f739eb4684aa0a8273ebc1c78; 058d01f3dbc144a7d3b64274acba9c19dc5317fc; 3bd31202f6e5a62373b4744dc0e91535908bf8df; 315d1eed34cc519b51904b19f899145d220736b8; 8bc3f5ce4e753630dc413f4c97988df04f3e05a4; 9ecae668ad78e5ab6ef099808fea219f815cf5c4; 9ae5d584339143d4d97bed0eff1978bb3761b9a5; b8e37c1f4d5a1338f3d04aa9e2fb9551b0b05234; f09daaa9066542bc9236f9e42db6102daa5b4334; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 0f07c69cde4ee6f453fa22f449347b470395d53f; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 820bef40b55ed5c1db68f148ebcc8e0e44c4326c; 6c8b6acf451b9e53ef2ed6ed3da4c107df248961; 8c4b2023700f228a8b49902e8d5692e771eea497; 822379e0884f5cfb8ac29e28b79b630984b2abc4; ac17187e4b5178cf115f99a7401e0c353672fdbb; 13f438454e7e71ccfd714e39c8783a1e49ba42ba; 8aa08f7713e2ce236b0bd38ce8811980e94c0dcc; 66a308b9fce07e2e988ab0f60903dd2d4e17684b,Statistica Sinica,28,"

a93397ef19fb3944b52f9e1efdb14a6c9a483e8b,Identifying comorbidity patterns of health conditions via cluster analysis of pairwise concordance statistics.,"Identification of comorbidity patterns of health conditions is critical for evidence-based practice to improve the prevention, treatment and health care of relevant diseases. Existing approaches focus mainly on either using descriptive measures of comorbidity in terms of the prevalence of coexisting conditions, or addressing the prevalence of comorbidity based on a particular disease (e.g. psychosis) or a specific population (e.g. hospital patients). As coincidental comorbidity by chance increases with the prevalence rates of the conditions, which in turn depend heavily on the population under study, research findings on comorbidity patterns using those approaches may provide unreliable results. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric version of Somers' D statistic to provide a quantitative measure of comorbidity that accounts for co-occurrence of conditions by chance, and develop a unified clustering algorithm to identify comorbidity patterns with adjustment for multiple testing and control for the false discovery rate. We assess the applicability of the proposed comorbidity measure and investigate the performance of the proposed procedure for the adjustment of multiple testing by conducting a comparative study and a sensitivity analysis, respectively. The proposed method is illustrated using a national survey data set of mental health and wellbeing and a national health survey data set in Australia.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shu Kay Ng"", ids = ""153064114""); list(name = ""Libby Holden"", ids = ""32882367""); list(name = ""Jing Sun"", ids = ""49991565"")",ccb50a814f392d08b85e45e54581c659e467f979; 0635dd51f60fef73b2e5854f01343d4bc304b22f; 410d250535d09def2b03a109557e64712eca5126; 8edd10901943fb75f7223df3ca05a31dd197afed; e1279a3c24ff1d2ac2885c1b0dd0c662fd35f3fa; 4b13121896079111ef126155e6c10ee296742c53; e826f70e0ab25e10adf9b60c9e420a3b25a4ccb2; c72adfa75d56d14390c9c98c2e7884e41f47336f; cef306d9d66b5bc47f4408986ff94d70623c1828; 76361656a4559afa099340f8015d11a820b141cf; 35adb9163d4e453a414d741779a49bc50ff33132; 5cedd471460ea4bf6a20e0cbf4e7643819ba4dd6; 6562e176a32359c9405006ad86f5b4e97c9dc041; d45ec6d1f10e5dd65e5f68874da0a5fb0c4e0597; 65dff107c8e90cd158adc5e055b1136184a0b531; 36e55311d997fc84bceb490497b77eaca5bdeb0f; bf5e7b69792cf6342250749d87c516fefc8cc871,,Statistics in medicine,31 27,"

2dcb161f52788a944b83b2ebbf4b370b1ee19e69,Population differences in microRNA expression and biological implications.,"Population differences observed for complex traits may be attributed to the combined effect of socioeconomic, environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors. To better understand population differences in complex traits, genome-wide genetic and gene expression differences among ethnic populations have been studied. Here we set out to evaluate population differences in small non-coding RNAs through an evaluation of microRNA (miRNA) baseline expression in HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 53 CEU (Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry) and 54 YRI (African from Ibadan, Nigeria). Using the Exiqon miRCURYTM LNA arrays, we found that 16% of all miRNAs evaluated in our study differ significantly between these 2 ethnic groups (pBonferroni corrected< 0.05). Furthermore, we explored the potential biological function of these observed differentially expressed miRNAs by comprehensively examining their effect on the transcriptome and their relationship with cellular sensitivity drug phenotypes. After multiple testing adjustment (false discovery rate (FDR)< 0.1), we found that 55% and 88% of the differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly and inversely correlated with an mRNA expression phenotype in the CEU and YRI samples, respectively. Interestingly, a substantial proportion (64%) of these miRNAs correlated with cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (FDR< 0.05). Lastly, upon performing a genome-wide association study between SNPs and miRNA expression, we identified a large number of SNPs exhibiting different allele frequencies that affect the expression of these differentially expressed miRNAs, suggesting the role of genetic variants in mediating the observed population differences.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""R.

b198ef350d69f521550ea6f187b89b06933f503a,Exploring the information in p-values for the analysis and planning of multiple-test experiments.,"A new methodology is proposed for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses in a large collection of tests. Each test concerns a single parameter delta whose value is specified by the null hypothesis. We combine a parametric model for the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the p-value given delta with a nonparametric spline model for the density g(delta) of delta under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion of true null hypotheses and the coefficients in the spline model are estimated by penalized least squares subject to constraints that guarantee that the spline is a density. The estimator is computed efficiently using quadratic programming. Our methodology produces an estimate g(delta) of the density of delta when the null is false and can address such questions as ""when the null is false, is the parameter usually close to the null or far away?"" This leads us to define a falsely interesting discovery rate (FIDR), a generalization of the false discovery rate. We contrast the FIDR approach to Efron's (2004, Journal of the American Statistical Association 99, 96-104) empirical null hypothesis technique. We discuss the use of g in sample size calculations based on the expected discovery rate (EDR). Our recommended estimator of the proportion of true nulls has less bias compared to estimators based upon the marginal density of the p-values at 1. In a simulation study, we compare our estimators to the convex, decreasing estimator of Langaas, Lindqvist, and Ferkingstad (2005, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 67, 555-572). The most biased of our estimators is very similar in performance to the convex, decreasing estimator. As an illustration, we analyze differences in gene expression between resistant and susceptible strains of barley.",2007,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""David Ruppert"", ids = ""144108246""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""48443856""); list(name = ""J.

cdd3a13b87e7837659803b7868d36682bb2f6c2e,Transcriptome profiling in oral cavity and esophagus tissues from (S)-N'-nitrosonornicotine-treated rats reveals candidate genes involved in human oral cavity and esophageal carcinogenesis.,"Recently, we have shown that (S)-N'-Nitrosonornicotine [(S)-NNN], the major form of NNN in tobacco products, is a potent oral cavity and esophageal carcinogen in rats. To determine the early molecular alterations induced by (S)-NNN in the oral and esophageal mucosa, we administered the carcinogen to rats in the drinking water for 10â€‰wk and global gene expression alterations were analyzed by RNA sequencing. At a false discovery rate P-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and fold-change â‰¥2, we found alterations in the level of 39 genes in the oral cavity and 69 genes in the esophagus. Validation of RNA sequencing results by qRT-PCR assays revealed a high cross-platform concordance. The most significant impact of exposure to (S)-NNN was alteration of genes involved in immune regulation (Aire, Ctla4, and CD80), inflammation (Ephx2 and Inpp5d) and cancer (Cdkn2a, Dhh, Fetub B, Inpp5d, Ly6E, Nr1d1, and Wnt6). Consistent with the findings in rat tissues, most of the genes were deregulated, albeit to different degrees, in immortalized oral keratinocytes treated with (S)-NNN and in non-treated premalignant oral cells and malignant oral and head and neck squamous cells. Furthermore, interrogation of TCGA data sets showed that genes deregulated by (S)-NNN in rat tissues (Fetub, Ly6e, Nr1d1, Cacna1c, Cd80, and Dgkg) are also altered in esophageal and head and neck tumors. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into early molecular changes induced by (S)-NNN and, therefore, could contribute to the development of biomarkers for the early detection and prevention of (S)-NNN-associated oral and esophageal cancers.

643825ac346bdf213b501ed1ee7b5fb5764c874c,B Cell Signature during Inactive Systemic Lupus Is Heterogeneous: Toward a Biological Dissection of Lupus,"Systemic lupus erythematosous (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with an important clinical and biological heterogeneity. B lymphocytes appear central to the development of SLE which is characterized by the production of a large variety of autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia. In mice, immature B cells from spontaneous lupus prone animals are able to produce autoantibodies when transferred into immunodeficient mice, strongly suggesting the existence of intrinsic B cell defects during lupus. In order to approach these defects in humans, we compared the peripheral B cell transcriptomas of quiescent lupus patients to normal B cell transcriptomas. When the statistical analysis is performed on the entire group of patients, the differences between patients and controls appear quite weak with only 14 mRNA genes having a false discovery rate ranging between 11 and 17%, with 6 underexpressed genes (PMEPA1, TLR10, TRAF3IP2, LDOC1L, CD1C and EGR1). However, unforced hierarchical clustering of the microarrays reveals a subgroup of lupus patients distinct from both the controls and the other lupus patients. This subgroup has no detectable clinical or immunological phenotypic peculiarity compared to the other patients, but is characterized by 1/an IL-4 signature and 2/the abnormal expression of a large set of genes with an extremely low false discovery rate, mainly pointing to the biological function of the endoplasmic reticulum, and more precisely to genes implicated in the Unfolded Protein Response, suggesting that B cells entered an incomplete BLIMP1 dependent plasmacytic differentiation which was undetectable by immunophenotyping.

The success of chemotherapeutic agents to treat various forms of cancer has a long history. Unfortunately, a major cause of treatment failure is drug resistance to currently available chemotherapy agents. Understanding the mechanism of resistance to multiple drugs has been a subject of considerable interest. ChemoFxÂ® holds the promise of not only determining which patient will respond to what therapy but also can be used to learn more about drug resistance while acting as a proxy to clinical outcome.

In this study, we used the ChemoFxÂ® to identify response vs. non-response to seven different chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, docetaxel, epirubicin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide) in 28 human breast cancer cell lines. Based on publically available gene expression profiles of these breast cancer cell lines and the ChemoFxÂ® results, differentially expressed (DE) genes related to multi-drug response were identified through meta-analysis method. Five hundred thirty six DE genes were identified to be related to multidrug response at the false discovery rate of 0.05. To segregate the effect of ER status, we also performed meta-analysis within ER positive or ER negative breast cancer cell lines separately. Thirty seven DE genes were identified related to multiple drug response in ER negative breast cancer cell lines and 20 DE genes in ER positive cell lines. Among all these DE genes, only one is in common between ER positive and ER negative groups. These results suggest that multi-drug resistance is the result of not just one gene but the contribution of multiple genes. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis showed that multidrug response genes are involved in different biological processes in ER positive vs. ER negative cell lines. The dissimilarity of multidrug response genes in ER positive vs. ER negative shows the value of integrating multidrug response gene information with clinical factors to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from current chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of multidrug response has the potential of identifying new therapeutic targets.

ea1a9f4cc29d8ba914e2a362fdbfa97673be0b76,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of daunorubicin in children: a report from the Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group,"AbstractPurpose
We explored the impact of obesity, body composition, and genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of daunorubicin in children with cancer.Patients and methodsPatients â‰¤21Â years receiving daunorubicin as an infusion of any duration <24Â h for any type of cancer were eligible. Plasma drug concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Obesity was defined as a BMI >95Â % for age or as body fat >30Â %. NONMEM was used to perform PK model fitting. The Affymetrix DMET chip was used for genotyping. The impact of genetic polymorphisms was investigated using SNP/haplotype association analysis with estimated individual PK parameters.ResultsA total of 107 subjects were enrolled, 98 patients had PK sampling, and 50 patients underwent DNA analysis. Population estimates for daunorubicin clearance and volume of distribution were 116Â L/m2/hÂ Â±Â 14Â % and 68.1Â L/m2Â Â±Â 24Â %, respectively. Apparent daunorubicinol clearance and volume of distribution were 26.8Â L/m2/hÂ Â±Â 5.6Â % and 232Â L/m2Â Â±Â 10Â %, respectively. No effect of body composition or obesity was observed on PK. Forty-four genes with variant haplotypes were tested for association with PK. FMO3-H1/H3 genotype was associated with lower daunorubicin clearance than FMO3-H1/H1, pÂ =Â 0.00829. GSTP1*B/*B genotype was also associated with lower daunorubicin clearance compared to GSTP1*A/*A, pÂ =Â 0.0347. However, neither of these associations was significant after adjusting for multiple testing by either Bonferroni or false discovery rate correction.Conclusions
We did not detect an effect of body composition or obesity on daunorubicin PK. We found suggestive associations between FMO3 and GSTP1 haplotypes with daunorubicin PK that could potentially affect efficacy and toxicity.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Patrick Thompson"", ids = ""47378910""); list(name = ""Heather E Wheeler"", ids = ""145934752""); list(name = ""Shannon M.

7eccabe7c6899bf8541cd3445c281321428139f4,F-distribution calibrated empirical likelihood ratio tests for multiple hypothesis testing,"ABSTRACT Multiple hypothesis testing can be important tools when conclusions are drawn by simultaneous testing of a large number of hypotheses in bioinformatics, general medicine, pharmacology and epidemiology. In this paper, we consider three nonparametric empirical likelihood ratio tests (ELRTs) for multiple hypothesis testing problems. When the number of hypotheses is far larger than sample size, however, these ELRTs using asymptotic chi-square calibration generally have much higher false discovery rate (FDR) and can be quite anti-conservative. We find that the first order term of the empirical likelihood ratio statistic closely resembles Hotelling's statistic admitting limiting F distributions for small sample size. Motivated by this result, we propose the F-distribution calibrated ELRTs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed tests not only can control the FDR in the acceptable range, but also guarantee the test efficacy in terms of maximising the number of discoveries for small and moderate sample sizes. Two real data applications are also included for illustration.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lei Wang"", ids = ""48169956""); list(name = ""Dan Yang"", ids = ""50773636"")",,b33b9f769f81e5546a3c18fa16a66713cfffccbb; 326f2fc52e391cbdd31edb727f222fec2fabb407; f920c1f1f4f30b82dd0c08860ade3d962e331c2b; 3531687122d47cbc5f9294aa8a0ff55122bfe10c; 2934355c03faa1094eb413241bb9de6753b48988; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; e3977db4fd8271a3b628a2b901f4ee0b94d3a86d; c49d0608e5ccd0fad01b7128509ae707dec3f639; 1086643c453895287174269eb2121491ef270c75; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 7673447ed7cae5a6fc191e50b3f36f1bcf3bcdcd; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 59ac99583c8c5ec9de91932ce2397baf81e84f4d; 72d999b37470ca58c0e7b025060e32257f667e51; 66610a8a0a94c994175cd70c9dde9240c9f3d841; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 9dcf4647506daac290511364726b1aa038cd4ec6; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 77ccad5e03bc179b0a5fd03b9501e34d95771144; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 23efca695ccca0924211f711adc862ea857449f2; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; 0d81f1051d96cfb038ee17ea760e4849304c4d52,Journal of Nonparametric Statistics,30,662 - 679

However, under multiple tests with sparse signals, the conventional joint significance test has a conservative test size and low power within a study because of the sparsity in signals and not accounting for the composition of different null hypotheses. We develop a novel test assessing the product of two normally distributed test statistics under a composite null hypothesis, where either one parameter is zero or both are zero. We show that the null composition can be adjusted by variances of test statistics without directly estimating proportions of different nulls. Advantages of the new test are illustrated in simulation and the epigenomic study. The new test identifies four methylation loci mediating the socioeconomic effect on adiposity with the false discovery rate less than 20% while existing methods had none surviving this cut-off.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yen-Tsung Huang"", ids = ""2649637"")",3feb555a89c5b81c341ffbe99ca6f034b1686e29,2ab2c940cc5aec27da916749219bacc75981332f; a282c1d0bcad3dbb1aab6f89fe85e46098c4d487; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8afe412a74a6564b5934f3b9181b5ff55eea76ad; 04670dbee5bd60c3a26fda1ba22d13552b72de59; eb59cf7717b6db35f54ad5b06e909c7d15e88dc1; d8574a62874312b81347438b1566cdb1c6d5abe5; 83ad2bcf30e4b03006b3c54c111657326613e78a; 3f4b5cdecabe849aa08fd4b44c3d042013134782; 6b21fab561b7031e30d084b9ba58951d1ed9c409; c3162089d994aefbe79f9447f4aec11e44c0a495; fa1c802c0fd61761e406944eef619389cf292984; 736fe0f00056229ea00d987e0f8760978d470c35; 165fecf2fb6d2bb1db5564b8212ae12d8becfa14; 451c0f785dea1edd60fe81becac953ba74e9c533; c1dad5822b1e635af593b5aeb887a06358b299a9; 262f73b448f7707d28cc6878f857e2f2c73fa93f; a24b7bf40c967f357e66b00dc7d2141a6966986c; d158680063539d86a18b1d47c8b59df375bd6b9c; 305c1929f9b5cd60aede21b30b7f6fb65b31dbd3; d1677bb22c11eea90ccc2a121d8322bc35195c7a; fc4b90342b119a5bb086f57ad920ec3f48bff2fe; 5c06f87f30dba84ddfc304b3e693b5e1eac0867c; baa174820857648e5de01ab562636c8d53f3176d; 329ad99dcd54ff7a921febaa03e91a0947c42da7; f358f4d61d650d77329479bb82160e2c3c15ef1f; f9a7543e55d0c0d6c1b29301deffbe9e4fc89051; 24db02cd419238b91650f7c4492b5dfe329f88b1; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 97510e2048af0c6c510aed405091514946c4eb13; c31eb0fc5eef6adc9f5869ff56184956fbaed2a3; d327c42b788e6829c95bd2fef148752f2f18d6f1; e6b310b05caf9c6d35ddc5ccfa97479fbdd62b98; 2caf81b3c200f3c5a4a42c57495f3a0c1265e3b2; b2b6216df4c8ba0e82facee0e418e12975d10964; 7aeb5ec8d6523ef822c86f8b5b13086ddf52c16d; 2b370450d041c90bf643f21eba14fd44e908386c; 608e20be619789d819c6a25c5110d7fd33a06d79; dc3e6cb0de10069f2d2699d3ae4044652d262db4,The Annals of Applied Statistics,13,60-84

5aa9c7f92b603d2490f3ff7e936b2dce1e4f95ac,CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-beta expression in vivo is associated with muscle strength.,"Declining muscle strength is a core feature of aging. Several mechanisms have been postulated, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-beta (C/EBP-Î²)-triggered macrophage-mediated muscle fiber regeneration after micro-injury, evidenced in a mouse model. We aimed to identify in vivo circulating leukocyte gene expression changes associated with muscle strength in the human adult population. We undertook a genome-wide expression microarray screen, using peripheral blood RNA samples from InCHIANTI study participants (aged 30 and 104). Logged expression intensities were regressed with muscle strength using models adjusted for multiple confounders. Key results were validated by real-time PCR. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score tested walk speed, chair stand, and balance. CEBPB expression levels were associated with muscle strength (Î² coefficient = 0.20560, P = 1.03*10(-6), false discovery rate q = 0.014). The estimated handgrip strength in 70-year-old men in the lowest CEBPB expression tertile was 35.2 kg compared with 41.2 kg in the top tertile. CEBPB expression was also associated with hip, knee, ankle, and shoulder strength and the SPPB score (P = 0.018). Near-study-wide associations were also noted for TGF-Î²3 (P = 3.4*10(-5) , q = 0.12) and CEBPD expression (P = 9.7*10(-5) , q = 0.18) but not for CEBPA expression. We report here a novel finding that raised CEBPB expression in circulating leukocyte-derived RNA samples in vivo is associated with greater muscle strength and better physical performance in humans. This association may be consistent with mouse model evidence of CEBPB-triggered muscle repair: if this mechanism is confirmed, it may provide a target for intervention to protect and enhance aging muscle.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lorna W.

To comprehensively assess brain iron levels in typically developing control subjects and patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when psychostimulant medication history is accounted for.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Brain iron was indexed noninvasively by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging relaxation rates (R2, R2*, R2') and magnetic field correlation (MFC) in the globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and thalamus for 22 patients with ADHD (12 medication-naÃ¯ve patients and 10 with a history of psychostimulant treatment) and 27 control subjects (age range, 8-18 years). Serum iron measures were also collected. Subgroup differences were analyzed with data-appropriate omnibus tests followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons; false discovery rate correction was conducted to control for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Medication-naÃ¯ve ADHD patients had significantly lower striatal and thalamic MFC indexes of brain iron than did control subjects (putamen, P = .012; caudate nucleus, P = .008; thalamus, P = .012) and psychostimulant-medicated ADHD patients (putamen, P = .006; caudate nucleus, P = .010; thalamus, P = .021). Conversely, the MFC indexes in medicated patients were comparable to those in control subjects. No significant differences were detected with R2, R2*, R2', or serum measures.


CONCLUSION
Lower MFC indexes of striatal and thalamic brain iron in medication-naÃ¯ve ADHD patients and lack of differences in psychostimulant-medicated patients suggest that MFC indexes of brain iron may represent a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker that responds to psychostimulant treatment.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vitria Adisetiyo"", ids = ""2517295""); list(name = ""Jens H.

5bfb8c89ac0ae8c9cdb14a0012e8120a7344fdd1,"Caffeic Acid Phenetyl Ester, a Brazilian-Green-Propolis Derivative, Induces apoptosis in AML Cells, Promotes up Regulation of G-Protein Signaling and Hyper Secretion of IL-8","Abstract 3274 Propolis is a generic name for an adhesive resin collected, processed and used by bees to plug gaps, smooth internal walls and protect the entrance of the hive from intruders. Chemically is a complex blend of resin and fragments of plant tissues, volatile substances and wax. It contains over 300 constituents including benzoic acids, flavonoids and cinnamic acid derivatives. The Brazilian green propolis (BGP) has been shown to have immunomodulatory and antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo. We selected the caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), which is one of the components of BGP, as a candidate molecule for further studies regarding the antineoplastic activity. Cytotoxicity induced by Brazilian green propolis alcoholic extract (BGPAE) and CAPE in the cell lineages of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (NB4 and NB4R2), and bone marrow cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis (primary cells) was evaluated by annexin V/propidium iodide staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. BGPAE and CAPE showed antiproliferative and apoptotic activity and this effect was dose and time dependent (Table 1 and 2). Accordingly, in primary cells, CAPE (32Î¼g/ml) for 24 hours significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to control. The median (25 and 75 percentiles) for the percentage of apoptotic cells was 17.32% (13-27%) in control and 37% (24-52%) in CAPE, p-value = 0.0008 The cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining and demonstrated that CAPE blocked the cell cycle at G2/M. In addition, CAPE induced activation of caspases 3 and 9, as determined by Western blot, thus suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The modulation of gene expression induced by CAPE in NB4 was determined by microarray using the CodeLink Uniset Human I bioarray (Amersham/GE) and analyzing 10,000 genes. Adopting a False Discovery Rate of 4.72% and using the Significance Analysis of Miroarray (SAM) software, we detected an increased expression of: negative mediators of cell cycle, including the dual specific phosphatases CDC14A, CDC14B and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor CDKN1A (p21/CIP1); protein phosphatases; chemokines and molecules associated with signaling by G protein. Furthermore, CAPE induced a decrease in gene expression of: positive mediators of cell cycle (including CDK4 and CCNA2); genes related to the â€œspliceosomeâ€ and protein translation. The most important differences in gene expression were confirmed by real time PCR using TaqmanÂ® technology (Applied Biosystems). Based on the microarray analysis, we decided to further study the production of IL-8 induced by CAPE in NB4 cells. Using an ELISA assay, it was detected a time dependent increase in the production of IL-8 at CAPE concentrations of 16 and 32Î¼g/ml that was significantly higher than in controls at 12 and 24h of treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that CAPE was able to block the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in APL cells, and induce the production of IL-8 ALP cells.

Effects of Hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection and relationships between altered lipid metabolites and markers of inflammation, microbial translocation, and hepatic function were examined. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Random forest, pathway mapping, and metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) were performed using dChip, Metaboanalyst, and MSEA software.ResultsA 35-metabolite signature mapping to lipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism distinguished HIV patients with advanced disease on PI-based ART from controls regardless of HCV serostatus (p<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)<0.1). Many altered lipids, including bile acids, sulfated steroids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids, were ligands of nuclear receptors that regulate metabolism and inflammation. Distinct clusters of altered lipids correlated with markers of inflammation (interferon-Î± and interleukin-6), microbial translocation (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LPS-binding protein), and hepatic function (bilirubin) (p<0.05). Lipid alterations showed substantial overlap with those reported in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD). Increased bile acids were associated with noninvasive markers of hepatic fibrosis (FIB-4, APRI, and YKL-40) and correlated with acylcarnitines, a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction.ConclusionsLipid alterations in HIV patients receiving PI-based ART are linked to markers of inflammation, microbial translocation, and hepatic function, suggesting that therapeutic strategies attenuating dysregulated innate immune activation and hepatic dysfunction may be beneficial for prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders in HIV patients.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Edana Cassol"", ids = ""4928689"");

ee56a5af58b3ce763d4f70275371c921ec985fc6,Controlling the rate of Type I error over a large set of statistical tests.,"When many tests of significance are examined in a research investigation with procedures that limit the probability of making at least one Type I error--the so-called familywise techniques of control--the likelihood of detecting effects can be very low. That is, when familywise error controlling methods are adopted to assess statistical significance, the size of the critical value that must be exceeded in order to obtain statistical significance can be extremely large when the number of tests to be examined is also very large. In our investigation we examined three methods for increasing the sensitivity to detect effects when family size is large: the false discovery rate of error control presented by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), a modified false discovery rate presented by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) which estimates the number of true null hypotheses prior to adopting false discovery rate control, and a familywise method modified to control the probability of committing two or more Type I errors in the family of tests examined--not one, as is the case with the usual familywise techniques. Our results indicated that the level of significance for the two or more familywise method of Type I error control varied with the testing scenario and needed to be set on occasion at values in excess of 0.15 in order to control the two or more rate at a reasonable value of 0.01. In addition, the false discovery rate methods typically resulted in substantially greater power to detect non-null effects even though their levels of significance were set at the standard 0.05 value.

9fa6f1a6bafe601acbc2b66fa4a30d3348a48ac1,Evolutionary Signatures amongst Disease Genes Permit Novel Methods for Gene Prioritization and Construction of Informative Gene-Based Networks,"Genes involved in the same function tend to have similar evolutionary histories, in that their rates of evolution covary over time. This coevolutionary signature, termed Evolutionary Rate Covariation (ERC), is calculated using only gene sequences from a set of closely related species and has demonstrated potential as a computational tool for inferring functional relationships between genes. To further define applications of ERC, we first established that roughly 55% of genetic diseases posses an ERC signature between their contributing genes. At a false discovery rate of 5% we report 40 such diseases including cancers, developmental disorders and mitochondrial diseases. Given these coevolutionary signatures between disease genes, we then assessed ERC's ability to prioritize known disease genes out of a list of unrelated candidates. We found that in the presence of an ERC signature, the true disease gene is effectively prioritized to the top 6% of candidates on average. We then apply this strategy to a melanoma-associated region on chromosome 1 and identify MCL1 as a potential causative gene. Furthermore, to gain global insight into disease mechanisms, we used ERC to predict molecular connections between 310 nominally distinct diseases. The resulting ""disease map"" network associates several diseases with related pathogenic mechanisms and unveils many novel relationships between clinically distinct diseases, such as between Hirschsprung's disease and melanoma. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of molecular evolution as a gene discovery platform and show that evolutionary signatures can be used to build informative gene-based networks.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nolan Priedigkeit"", ids = ""4854774""); list(name = ""Nicholas W.

Two situations that may lead to discretely supported distributions are when the p-values arise from Monte Carlo or permutation tests are used. Grouped p-values may occur when p-values are quantized for storage. In the neuroimaging context, grouped p-values may occur when data are stored in an integer-encoded form. We present a method for FDR control that is applicable in cases where only p-values are available for inference, and when those p-values are discretely supported or grouped. We assess our method via a comprehensive set of simulation scenarios and find that our method can outperform commonly used FDR control schemes in various cases.

84dca92e839864988a56c439bb7e4f94adebf7b0,Two-stage stepup procedures controlling FDR,"Abstract A two-stage stepup procedure is defined and an explicit formula for the FDR of this procedure is derived under any distributional setting. Sets of critical values are determined that provide a control of the FDR of a two-stage stepup procedure under iid mixture model. A class of two-stage FDR procedures modifying the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg (BH) procedure and containing the one given in Storey et al. [2004. Strong control, conservative point estimation and simultanaeous conservative consistency of false discovery rates: a unified approach. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 66, 187â€“205] is obtained. The FDR controlling property of the Storeyâ€“Taylorâ€“Siegmund procedure is proved only under the independence, which is different from that presented by these authors. A single-stage stepup procedure controlling the FDR under any form of dependence, which is different from and in some situations performs better than the Benjaminiâ€“Yekutieli (BY) procedure, is given before discussing how to obtain two-stage versions of the BY and this new procedures. Simulations reveal that procedures proposed in this article under the mixture model can perform quite well in terms of improving the FDR control of the BH procedure. However, the similar idea of improving the FDR control of a stepup procedure under any form dependence does not seem to work.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

2197c9379f47f8fb36eb1686ca82211a8c8d5b6c,Structure Learning of Gaussian Markov Random Fields with False Discovery Rate Control,"In this paper, we propose a new estimation procedure for discovering the structure of Gaussian Markov random fields (MRFs) with false discovery rate (FDR) control, making use of the sorted l1-norm (SL1) regularization. A Gaussian MRF is an acyclic graph representing a multivariate Gaussian distribution, where nodes are random variables and edges represent the conditional dependence between the connected nodes. Since it is possible to learn the edge structure of Gaussian MRFs directly from data, Gaussian MRFs provide an excellent way to understand complex data by revealing the dependence structure among many inputs features, such as genes, sensors, users, documents, etc. In learning the graphical structure of Gaussian MRFs, it is desired to discover the actual edges of the underlying but unknown probabilistic graphical model-it becomes more complicated when the number of random variables (features) p increases, compared to the number of data points n. In particular, when p >> n, it is statistically unavoidable for any estimation procedure to include false edges. Therefore, there have been many trials to reduce the false detection of edges, in particular, using different types of regularization on the learning parameters. Our method makes use of the SL1 regularization, introduced recently for model selection in linear regression. We focus on the benefit of SL1 regularization that it can be used to control the FDR of detecting important random variables. Adapting SL1 for probabilistic graphical models, we show that SL1 can be used for the structure learning of Gaussian MRFs using our suggested procedure nsSLOPE (neighborhood selection Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation), controlling the FDR of detecting edges.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sangkyun Lee"", ids = ""39525147""); list(name = ""Piotr Sobczyk"", ids = ""47367761""); list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""144726010"")",,1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; f8523b75f63c9fe4f0fc713409f1f35c87dd1a17; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; eeb84d29e532ebe5216875a0e0797793a622488c; 81a0b8cb47986b4ef54753faf37f690df81d9b7d; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; f67f6a0a05e5a33b0bbd48d8a7852515155e82bf; 8d6081993c9a65f333597582e6b60e7ab593b8ac; fbcb62a2c9f3f06c62dea5eab209aa5e83e2fbd1; 5006e66095e3a42634e5ee4de59f10220c204778; 4a0a106879b196eabeb0c298e6f415ddf168d529; fe8c6411619e17aa8337796801dad39681548ef1; eba49f4e6256f44fb6a2fab5ee95519e9a9fb49f; 785ede21535ff3a4ccc75daa990e45363db3a363; e4b431957974db4dc82a1d822601dd48101f5420; 9a3edc623b5ffa7522ed8f37c01ce4b5125002ad; 08989ec798340aa7cea17e72a8d096479afd62c3; 9bb23885ac0148049af8b6e4ada5a626e3842bac; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 643ce4aa9d6c82b9985c132ca4c575d45476e6c6; 0e40441cebb03fa4df6fad43ef5ff592e34c479b; 453ad9b414c1b35492e7b5b455cfca5684556e9c; 8d3a318b62d2e970122da35b2a2e70a5d12cc16f; 3c718363c22221fd16771672da3bfd5f67d2c34c; c1c6c6e935804bd27f65d4b7fab03719a046c439; 91a95bf76f977328f95bf7e88ab7669ca29f96f1; d071da85b6bf876e5f62cc60f034692b8ecc291a; 64233cfc7d8f61d966d02c74bed07d780b4337ac; c8d4be093cd4da26f0402b6b9b2680d7ffae2959; 003e586edfa3101af83abb21c694f89aef007b7a; b0512bb40f6ed69fba37a7f39a93f599beabdf10; 042b6d1ec41f070102f2a95db72b69a1824f18f7; f0ae103143a0b7ebad2986dd5255c0320196698e; 85a72aba2ffc9e3b46fff5b0ef498ce56a3a29d1; 97f708f7b785bfa02810268d878245f0ca8be0ba; c00dd66ed334699371679d8992571d11e0c3ef1d; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263,ArXiv,abs/1910.10860,

Previous studies mostly focused on volume analysis, and the main challenge in shape analysis is the required step of establishing shape correspondence among individual shapes. We developed a simple and efficient method based on anatomical landmarks. 14 females and 10 males with matching ages participated in this study. 3D ventricle models were segmented from MR images by a semiautomatic method. Six anatomically meaningful landmarks were identified by detecting the maximum curvature point in a small neighborhood of a manually clicked point on the 3D model. Thin-plate spline was used to transform a randomly selected template shape to each of the rest shape instances, and the point correspondence was established according to Euclidean distance and surface normal. All shapes were spatially aligned by Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Hotelling T2 twosample metric was used to compare the ventricle shapes between males and females, and False Discovery Rate estimation was used to correct for the multiple comparison. The results revealed significant differences in the anterior horn of the right ventricle.",2010,Physics; Engineering,"list(name = ""Qing He"", ids = ""144131273""); list(name = ""Dmitriy Karpman"", ids = ""35153246""); list(name = ""Ye Duan"", ids = ""145013346"")",,c5730ba28c549b205a69a4d2c241867ea2260e05; 010fc6451a2edc95a76f731da8e5a5b3fda12fad; e4e4d3fb2bdc62e3a09060253d37f8bcbf346689; c64273ce894c0b685ed6eb3cd24590fdd12ca5c8; 2dcd0d8f1fc352f12f873d790cd202855aa66682; 94824859603b2eef4732405ed62566c1dc8f2cad; ab51bce59de790cc33ef7fac6468bcbaac3447b8; f22dfce4dae4b4ede103d732361b2ab1f7f0bda5; 8b1a1b2662dc570596c36a5e2d1b1290d596fc17; 23734a3f27314da5f8acbd305385a7a40cdd2d74; aaf2cbf012a6de1fe5b010f28fd36437d7eca82c; d92f735b0773b4e697e7e72798eccae2f647acd6; 30c54ba2eba1be26e44f38a24b4cb0ee61c1e2d0; c0acb752e382d7fde1a280cafb0852aef2010bda; 088ac9e386eca4aeb0db7cdd687c0f4eccfb6b6f; 26608aaba87faed5a72b62c60bbf9185933a0251; 904b66a9d48e5fe43a82c3dc607ad342efaeeba5; 708d9a8baac3b47e5095c943fbe027675dd9eb7f; dc7a182d26f0a7e8156566553eeca5e9afbd805e; f6a4c1814653f65ed82b5559766dca766c639e26,,7626,

e0f23928981094bd8bd724c13132c34263060304,Ichthyosis molecular fingerprinting shows profound TH17 skewing and a unique barrier genomic signature,"Background: Ichthyoses are a group of rare skin disorders lacking effective treatments. Although genetic mutations are progressively delineated, comprehensive molecular phenotyping of ichthyotic skin could suggest muchâ€needed pathogenesisâ€based therapy. Objective: We sought to profile the molecular fingerprint of the most common orphan ichthyoses. Methods: Gene, protein, and serum studies were performed on skin and blood samples from 29 patients (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, n = 9; lamellar ichthyosis, n = 8; epidermolytic ichthyosis, n = 8; and Netherton syndrome, n = 4), as well as ageâ€matched healthy control subjects (n = 14), patients with psoriasis (n = 30), and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD; n = 16). Results: Using criteria of a fold change of greater than 2 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05, 132 differentially expressed genes were shared commonly among all ichthyoses, including many ILâ€17 and TNFâ€&agr;â€“coregulated genes, which are considered hallmarks of psoriasis (defensin beta 4A, kynureninase, and vanin 3). Although striking upregulation of TH17 pathway genes (IL17F and IL36B/G) resembling that seen in patients with psoriasis was common to all patients with ichthyoses in a severityâ€related manner, patients with Netherton syndrome showed the greatest Tâ€cell activation (inducible costimulator [ICOS]) and a broader immune phenotype with TH1/IFNâ€&ggr;, OASL, and TH2/ILâ€4 receptor/ILâ€5 skewing, although less than seen in patients with AD (all P < .05). Ichthyoses lacked the epidermal differentiation and tight junction alterations of patients with AD (loricrin, filaggrin, and claudin 1) but showed characteristic alterations in lipid metabolism genes (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 and galanin), with parallel reductions in extracellular lipids and corneocyte compaction in all ichthyoses except epidermolytic ichthyosis, suggesting phenotypic variations. Transepidermal water loss, a functional barrier measure, significantly correlated with ILâ€17â€“regulated gene expression (IL17F and IL36A/IL36B/IL36G). Conclusion: Similar to patients with AD and psoriasis, in whom cytokine dysregulation and barrier impairment orchestrate disease phenotypes, psoriasisâ€like immune dysregulation and lipid alterations characterize the ichthyoses. These data support the testing of ILâ€17/ILâ€36â€“targeted therapeutics for patients with ichthyosis similar to those used in patients with psoriasis.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kunal Malik"", ids = ""46485771""); list(name = ""Helen He"", ids = ""46350365""); list(name = ""Thy Nhat Huynh"", ids = ""39972732""); list(name = ""Gary Tran"", ids = ""9545786""); list(name = ""Kelly Mueller"", ids = ""48487883""); list(name = ""Kristina Doytcheva"", ids = ""31755625""); list(name = ""Yael Renertâ\200\220Yuval"", ids = ""1390167335""); list(name = ""Tali Czarnowicki"", ids = ""6355918""); list(name = ""Shai Magidi"", ids = ""40914379""); list(name = ""Margaret Chou"", ids = ""48705415""); list(name = ""Yeriel D.

01a0d00a4d36f9253137be8df23fdca442de45e7,Quantitative Comparison of Statistical Methods for Analyzing Human Metabolomics Data,"Background. Emerging technologies now allow for mass spectrometry based profiling of up to thousands of small molecule metabolites (metabolomics) in an increasing number of biosamples. While offering great promise for revealing insight into the pathogenesis of human disease, standard approaches have yet to be established for statistically analyzing increasingly complex, high-dimensional human metabolomics data in relation to clinical phenotypes including disease outcomes. To determine optimal statistical approaches for metabolomics analysis, we sought to formally compare traditional statistical as well as newer statistical learning methods across a range of metabolomics dataset types. Results. In simulated and experimental metabolomics data derived from large population-based human cohorts, we observed that with an increasing number of study subjects, univariate compared to multivariate methods resulted in a higher false discovery rate due to substantial correlations among metabolites. In scenarios wherein the number of assayed metabolites increases, as in the application of nontargeted versus targeted metabolomics measures, multivariate methods performed especially favorably across a range of statistical operating characteristics. In nontargeted metabolomics datasets that included thousands of metabolite measures, sparse multivariate models demonstrated greater selectivity and lower potential for spurious relationships. Conclusion. When the number of metabolites was similar to or exceeded the number of study subjects, as is common with nontargeted metabolomics analysis of relatively small sized cohorts, sparse multivariate models exhibited the most robust statistical power with more consistent results. These findings have important implications for the analysis of metabolomics studies of human disease.",2017,Biology; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Brian Lee Claggett"", ids = ""2631406""); list(name = ""Joseph Antonelli"", ids = ""34875766""); list(name = ""Mir Henglin"", ids = ""6062062""); list(name = ""Jeramie D.

ebd11ec08cbb3474024debaa5b4177d07ec26e3a,Stress-response pathways are altered in the hippocampus of chronic alcoholics.,"The chronic high-level alcohol consumption seen in alcoholism leads to dramatic effects on the hippocampus, including decreased white matter, loss of oligodendrocytes and other glial cells, and inhibition of neurogenesis. Examining gene expression in post mortem hippocampal tissue from 20 alcoholics and 19 controls allowed us to detect differentially expressed genes that may play a role in the risk for alcoholism or whose expression is modified by chronic consumption of alcohol. We identified 639 named genes whose expression significantly differed between alcoholics and controls at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.20; 52% of these genes differed by at least 1.2-fold. Differentially expressed genes included the glucocorticoid receptor and the related gene FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8), urea transporter (SLC14A1), zinc transporter (SLC39A10), Interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), and many metallothioneins. Pathways related to inflammation, hypoxia, and stress showed activation, and pathways that play roles in neurogenesis and myelination showed decreases. The cortisol pathway dysregulation and increased inflammation identified here are seen in other stress-related conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and most likely play a role in addiction. Many of the detrimental effects on the hippocampus appear to be mediated through NF-ÎºB signaling. Twenty-four of the differentially regulated genes were previously identified by genome-wide association studies of alcohol use disorders; this raises the potential interest of genes not normally associated with alcoholism, such as suppression of tumorigenicity 18 (ST18), BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), and von Willebrand factor (VWF).",2013,Medicine; Psychology; Biology,"list(name = ""Jeanette N.

a099ee506493ae62628a0183957a2dfc82d7a529,Altered pathways in methylome and transcriptome longitudinal analysis of normal weight and bariatric surgery women,"DNA methylation could provide a link between environmental, genetic factors and weight control and can modify gene expression pattern. This study aimed to identify genes, which are differentially expressed and methylated depending on adiposity state by evaluating normal weight women and obese women before and after bariatric surgery (BS). We enrolled 24 normal weight (BMI: 22.5â€‰Â±â€‰1.6â€‰kg/m2) and 24 obese women (BMI: 43.3â€‰Â±â€‰5.7â€‰kg/m2) submitted to BS. Genome-wide methylation analysis was conducted using Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip (threshold for significant CpG sites based on delta methylation level with a minimum value of 5%, a false discovery rate correction (FDR) of qâ€‰<â€‰0.05 was applied). Expression levels were measured using HumanHT-12v4 Expression BeadChip (cutoff of p â‰¤ 0.05 and fold change â‰¥2.0 was used to detect differentially expressed probes). The integrative analysis of both array data identified four genes (i.e. TPP2, PSMG6, ARL6IP1 and FAM49B) with higher methylation and lower expression level in pre-surgery women compared to normal weight women: and two genes (i.e. ZFP36L1 and USP32) that were differentially methylated after BS. These methylation changes were in promoter region and gene body. All genes are related to MAPK cascade, NIK/NF-kappaB signaling, cellular response to insulin stimulus, proteolysis and others. Integrating analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression evidenced that there is a set of genes relevant to obesity that changed after BS. A gene ontology analysis showed that these genes were enriched in biological functions related to adipogenesis, orexigenic, oxidative stress and insulin metabolism pathways. Also, our results suggest that although methylation plays a role in gene silencing, the majority of effects were not correlated.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Carolina Ferreira Nicoletti"", ids = ""31414621""); list(name = ""Marcela Augusta Souza Pinhel"", ids = ""5138811""); list(name = ""NatÃ¡lia Yumi Noronha"", ids = ""115362310""); list(name = ""Bruno Affonso Parenti de Oliveira"", ids = ""116177934""); list(name = ""Wilson Salgado JÃºnior"", ids = ""80482993""); list(name = ""Amalia JÃ¡come"", ids = ""1388237961""); list(name = ""Ã\201ngel Diaz-Lagares"", ids = ""1400862411""); list(name = ""F.F.

2737f9404fb8b69ccc22d7224a907957c2e7c4e6,White matter changes in chronic and episodic migraine: a diffusion tensor imaging study,"BackgroundWhite matter alterations have been observed in patients with migraine. However, no microstructural white matter alterations have been found particularly in episodic or chronic migraine patients, and there is limited research focused on the comparison between these two groups of migraine patients.MethodsFifty-one healthy controls, 55 episodic migraine patients and 57 chronic migraine patients were recruited and underwent brain T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition. Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity were compared between the different groups. On the one hand, all migraine patients were compared against healthy controls. On the other hand, patients from each migraine group were compared between them and also against healthy controls. Correlation analysis between clinical features (duration of migraine in years, time from onset of chronic migraine in months, where applicable, and headache and migraine frequency, where applicable) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging measures was performed.ResultsFifty healthy controls, 54 episodic migraine and 56 chronic migraine patients were finally included in the analysis. Significant decreased axial diffusivity (pâ€‰<â€‰.05 false discovery rate and by number of contrasts corrected) was found in chronic migraine compared to episodic migraine in 38 white matter regions from the Johns Hopkins University ICBM-DTI-81 White-Matter Atlas. Significant positive correlation was found between time from onset of chronic migraine and mean fractional anisotropy in the bilateral external capsule, and negative correlation between time from onset of chronic migraine and mean radial diffusivity in the bilateral external capsule.ConclusionsThese findings suggest global white matter structural differences between episodic migraine and chronic migraine.

3594c17c1587c94926710cb3dcc62cffeeeae832,The proteios software environment: an extensible multiuser platform for management and analysis of proteomics data.,"Proteome analysis involves many steps that generate large quantities of data in different formats. This creates a need for automatic data merging and extraction of important features from data. Furthermore, metadata need to be collected and reported to enable critical evaluation of results. Many data analysis tools are developed locally in research laboratories and are nontrivial to adapt for other laboratories, preventing optimal exploitation of generated data. The proteomics field would benefit from user-friendly analysis and data management platforms in which method developers can make their analysis tools available for the community. Here, we describe the Proteios Software Environment (ProSE) that is built around a Web-based local data repository for proteomics experiments. The application features sample tracking, project sharing between multiple users, and automated data merging and analysis. ProSE has built-in support for several quantitative proteomics workflows, and integrates searching in several search engines, automated combination of the search results with predetermined false discovery rates, annotation of proteins and submission of results to public repositories. ProSE also provides a programming interface to enable local extensions, as well as database access using Web services. ProSE provides an analysis platform for proteomics research and is targeted for multiuser projects with needs to share data, sample tracking, and analysis result.

d12b1dc5d88c38af467aac5eb19b09f120f39564,A Likelihood Ratio Approach for Precise Discovery of Truly Relevant Protein Markers,"The process of biomarker discovery is typically lengthy and costly, involving the phases of discovery, qualification, verification, and validation before clinical evaluation. Being able to efficiently identify the truly relevant markers in discovery studies can significantly simplify the process. However, in discovery studies the sample size is typically small while the number of markers being explored is much larger. Hence discovery studies suffer from sparsity and high dimensionality issues. Currently the state-of-the-art methods either find too many false positives or fail to identify many truly relevant markers. In this paper we develop a likelihood ratio-based approach and aim for accurately finding the truly relevant protein markers in discovery studies. Our method fits especially well with discovery studies because they are mostly balanced design due to the fact that experiments are limited and controlled. Our approach is based on the observation that the underlying distributions of expression profiles are unimodal for those irrelevant plain markers. Our method has asymptotic chi-square null distribution which facilitates the efficient control of false discovery rate. We then evaluate our method using both simulated and real experimental data. In all the experiments our method is highly effective to discover the set of truly relevant markers, leading to accurate biomarker identifications with high sensitivity and low empirical false discovery rate.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lin-Yang Cheng"", ids = ""2534975""); list(name = ""Bowei Xi"", ids = ""35476307"")",,21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; dc0ee7af5488222cfcfd247bc3a6ddc0d19395e6; 87c9767c57b3baf39345e8e3cc83c3638ed96d69; 5398e36689b8fff60fe1f6991ccd1bcc7e3b80ff; f500b455de88e58988a89cb7899bfd271f37e280; 0ab02b9ac912ae86f8725c8c4ab49a58232607d9; 7493b467a81dbf7b4efab2c50ccb96557c12979c; 0498ecdf8a2723f7d36459149616336be378b0cd; 85dc41bcc85925e00a2e0ab3feef79853431dc45; af36e48b2a87d8d7b669bf0f05084f152167e245; 3a5fa1ea14cea5e55e4e1f844f78332fccefa285,arXiv: Applications,,
e8794b45aea8712a86fcd4c2ce636ca3e8cffd5b,Sample size calculation with dependence adjustment for FDR-control in microarray studies.,"DNA microarrays have been widely used for the purpose of simultaneously monitoring a large number of gene expression levels to identify differentially expressed genes. Statistical methods for the adjustment of multiple testing have been discussed extensively in the literature. An important further challenge is the existence of dependence among test statistics due to reasons such as gene co-regulation. To plan large-scale genomic studies, sample size determination with appropriate adjustment for both multiple testing and potential dependency among test statistics is crucial to avoid an abundance of false-positive results and/or serious lack of power. We introduce a general approach for calculating sample sizes for two-way multiple comparisons in the presence of dependence among test statistics to ensure adequate overall power when the false discovery rates are controlled. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical studies using both simulated data and real data from a well-known study of leukaemia.",2007,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yongzhao Shao"", ids = ""145464656""); list(name = ""Chi-hong Tseng"", ids = ""2747182"")",f10fd4d385fa90a66f7ef873d1bf47604e7bf7da; 2352260cf0eb99321b34c57be2424679cf957d87; 3faaefced4475838e527739bc5181c49f51b30cd; 30f5604b3c60a14f0c0af724f8034d82abcadc29; d7e763d8b9e65a1e702969c16528d7070521b198; a9845389de11b74b79467293d1c4c221760a8e3b; 498c8b03986d65bb6791d37e93d5ae10ce61fc87; da3e993c290c00a858a55d3e7b0a6d65996c1901; 56d17f14f1eb41c7be3c5e1a964c3a6ef4a31c63; 86d76874ed6637da0245ebbbae722dc175632c4d; ef8b59845865c7d03414667a53adcccc15666a78; a3af52a76791e56f9189bb4704242e4a34469955; 2eefc2b08ac3f1608fe39bfa78e1274b76f3bc2c; 2c4cae3e7a200b6bc2968ad29f33989e65cd19b8; e0f86a04e22973280c6774a893baedc8ef0245ee; 1cade48f4677e6863148988a6fc96ed34c8e91a8; e570728b6966e4e1c143da60e8256f13e948d4e7; 8b1d3d7f8f124712e3931466a2ad3ba044b24323,,Statistics in medicine,26 23,"

c893907f5093af4de3784b9704ffa8bad0567079,Volume changes and brain-behavior relationships in white matter and subcortical gray matter in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.,"Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) may have cognitive, behavioral and brain abnormalities. Here, we compare rates of white matter and subcortical gray matter volume change in PAE and control children, and examine relationships between annual volume change and arithmetic ability, behavior, and executive function. Participants (n = 75 PAE/64 control; age: 7.1-15.9 years) each received two structural magnetic resonance scans, ~2 years apart. Assessments included Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Child Behavior Checklist and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Subcortical white and gray volumes were extracted for each hemisphere. Group volume differences were tested using false discovery rate (q < 0.05). Analyses examined group-by-age interactions and group-score interactions for correlations between change in volume and raw behavioral scores. Results showed that subjects with PAE had smaller volumes than control subjects across the brain. Significant group-score interactions were found in temporal and parietal regions for WISC arithmetic scores and in frontal and parietal regions for behavioral measures. Poorer cognitive/ behavioral outcomes were associated with larger volume increases in PAE, while control subjects generally showed no significant correlations. In contrast with previous results demonstrating different trajectories of cortical volume change in PAE, our results show similar rates of subcortical volume growth in subjects with PAE and control subjects. We also demonstrate abnormal brain-behavior relationships in subjects with PAE, suggesting different use of brain resources. Our results are encouraging in that, due to the stable volume differences, there may be an extended window of opportunity for intervention in children with PAE.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Prapti Gautam"", ids = ""3475091""); list(name = ""Catherine Lebel"", ids = ""2058576""); list(name = ""Katherine Narr"", ids = ""1924772""); list(name = ""Sarah N Mattson"", ids = ""2945299""); list(name = ""Philip A May"", ids = ""39133142""); list(name = ""Colleen Adnams"", ids = ""3574014""); list(name = ""Edward P.

8ffd30eee2d38ac154a792b8707bb1e3321d8dfd,33 Bioinformatic Class Discovery of Potential Biomarkers in Ventilator-associated Lung Injury.,"Rationale The unilateral (one lung injured and the contralateral lung intact) model of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) allows us to utilize uninjured lung as the systemic VALI effects indicator. We speculated that regulation of genes in uninjured lung will be attributed to blood or lymph carrying effectors produced by an injured lung and the analysis of upstream bioprocesses governed by affected genes will lead to the effectors9 discovery. Methods Dogs ( n = 4) were intubated, left lung lavaged, and then both lungs were either independently ventilated (total Vt = 15 mL/kg) for 6 hours (injured and uninjured) or immediately harvested (control). Lung mRNA ( n = 16 for all three groups) was hybridized to HG_U133A and analyzed by SAM using interspecies probe adjustment. Genes with the lowest false discovery rate (q = 0.124%) that imposed fold change (FC) range from -3.52 to -1.26 and 1.22 to 6.96 with corresponding FC averages -1.59 and 2.01 were considered affected by VALI. Gene ontology filtering for receptor activity term was conducted by MAPPFinder. Results Our analyses revealed 22 receptor-related genes, of which 7 were growth factor receptors including EGFR (FC = -1.54), FGFR1 (FC = -1.59), FGFR2 (FC = -1.56), and PDGFR (FC = -1.30). The overall down-regulation of these receptors was concordant with decreased expression of their corresponding ligands in injured lung including EGF (FC = -1.39), FGF2 (FC = -1.39), PDGFA (FC = -1.41), and PDGFB (FC = -2.00). Fibroblast (Z = 6.17) and epidermal (Z = 4.49) growth factor receptor activity were the first and the third significantly (Z > 1.96) affected pathways. Conclusions Our approaches effectively identify a class of potential biomarkers in VALI. Further investigation of this study may elucidate systemic VALI effects and facilitate the development of new diagnostic tools.

65a89c2d579661484e6938d7f5269e45743fc9c2,Fast and Accurate Approximation to Significance Tests in Genome-Wide Association Studies.,"Genome-wide association studies commonly involve simultaneous tests of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for disease association. The SNPs in nearby genomic regions, however, are often highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium (LD, a genetic term for correlation). Simple Bonferonni correction for multiple comparisons is therefore too conservative. Permutation tests, which are often employed in practice, are both computationally expensive for genome-wide studies and limited in their scopes. We present an accurate and computationally efficient method, based on Poisson de-clumping heuristics, for approximating genome-wide significance of SNP associations. Compared with permutation tests and other multiple comparison adjustment approaches, our method computes the most accurate and robust p-value adjustments for millions of correlated comparisons within seconds. We demonstrate analytically that the accuracy and the efficiency of our method are nearly independent of the sample size, the number of SNPs, and the scale of p-values to be adjusted. In addition, our method can be easily adopted to estimate false discovery rate. When applied to genome-wide SNP datasets, we observed highly variable p-value adjustment results evaluated from different genomic regions. The variation in adjustments along the genome, however, are well conserved between the European and the African populations. The p-value adjustments are significantly correlated with LD among SNPs, recombination rates, and SNP densities. Given the large variability of sequence features in the genome, we further discuss a novel approach of using SNP-specific (local) thresholds to detect genome-wide significant associations.

626f44c1c8f2f22595fee76d2022b7c16ad73951,Extensive changes in the transcriptional profile of human adipose tissue including genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation after a 6-month exercise intervention.,"AIM
Adipose tissue has an important function in total energy homeostasis, and its dysregulation may contribute to lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate genome-wide mRNA expression in adipose tissue in healthy men before and after an exercise intervention to identify genes or pathways that mediate the beneficial effect of regular exercise. We also investigated the difference in adipose tissue mRNA expression between individuals with or without a family history of type 2 diabetes.


METHODS
The 6-month supervised exercise intervention was conducted in 47 healthy men (age 37.8 Â± 4.3 years, BMI 28.5 Â± 3.6 kg m(-2) ) with a previous low level of physical activity. RNA was analysed using GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix) before and after the exercise.


RESULTS
We identified 2,560 significant transcripts differentially expressed before vs. after exercise with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1%, including genes encoding the respiratory chain, histone subunits, small nucleolar RNAs and ribosomal proteins. Additionally, pathways enriched in response to exercise include the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, proteasome and many metabolic pathways, whereas the WNT and MAPK signalling pathways were down-regulated (FDR < 5%) after exercise. There were no significant differences in mRNA expression between individuals with or without a family history of type 2 diabetes.


CONCLUSION
Exercise increased the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which is the opposite of what has been seen in adipose tissue from elderly or obese individuals with low physical fitness, and our study thereby demonstrates a mechanism for the beneficial effect of exercise.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tina RÃ¶nn"", ids = ""3930915""); list(name = ""P.

0574703b3492421c2200d93778573a83f3fff5f2,Healthy Nordic diet downregulates the expression of genes involved in inflammation in subcutaneous adipose tissue in individuals with features of the metabolic syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
Previously, a healthy Nordic diet (ND) has been shown to have beneficial health effects close to those of Mediterranean diets.


OBJECTIVE
The objective was to explore whether the ND has an impact on gene expression in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and whether changes in gene expression are associated with clinical and biochemical effects.


DESIGN
Obese adults with features of the metabolic syndrome underwent an 18- to 24-wk randomized intervention study comparing the ND with the control diet (CD) (the SYSDIET study, carried out within Nordic Centre of Excellence of the Systems Biology in Controlled Dietary Interventions and Cohort Studies). The present study included participants from 3 Nordic SYSDIET centers [Kuopio (n = 20), Lund (n = 18), and Oulu (n = 18)] with a maximum weight change of Â±4 kg, highly sensitive C-reactive protein concentration <10 mg/L at the beginning and the end of the intervention, and baseline body mass index (in kg/mÂ²) <38. SAT biopsy specimens were obtained before and after the intervention and subjected to global transcriptome analysis with Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).


RESULTS
Altogether, 128 genes were differentially expressed in SAT between the ND and CD (nominal P < 0.01; false discovery rate, 25%). These genes were overrepresented in pathways related to immune response (adjusted P = 0.0076), resulting mainly from slightly decreased expression in the ND and increased expression in the CD. Immune-related pathways included leukocyte trafficking and macrophage recruitment (e.g., interferon regulatory factor 1, CD97), adaptive immune response (interleukin32, interleukin 6 receptor), and reactive oxygen species (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1). Interestingly, the regulatory region of the 128 genes was overrepresented for binding sites for the nuclear transcription factor ÎºB.


CONCLUSION
A healthy Nordic diet reduces inflammatory gene expression in SAT compared with a control diet independently of body weight change in individuals with features of the metabolic syndrome.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marjukka Kolehmainen"", ids = ""4964616""); list(name = ""Stine Marie Ulven"", ids = ""6250755""); list(name = ""Jussi Paananen"", ids = ""2219014""); list(name = ""Vanessa D de Mello"", ids = ""34613024""); list(name = ""Ursula S Schwab"", ids = ""2240868""); list(name = ""Carsten Carlberg"", ids = ""145342803""); list(name = ""Mari C.

b7c989c7ac53a8a4293b5199915766191d88f0eb,Large-scale Identification of N-linked Intact Glycopeptides in Human Serum using HILIC Enrichment and Spectral Library Search*,"Large-scale identification of N-linked intact glycopeptides by liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in human serum is challenging due to the wide dynamic range of serum protein abundances, the lack of a complete serum N-glycan database and the existence of proteoforms. In this regard, a spectral library search method was presented for the identification of N-linked intact glycopeptides from N-linked glycoproteins in human serum with target-decoy and motif-specific false discovery rate (FDR) control. Serum proteins were first separated into low-abundant and high-abundant proteins by acetonitrile (ACN) precipitation. After digestion, the N-linked intact glycopeptides were enriched by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and a portion of the enriched N-linked intact glycopeptides were processed by N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) to generate N-linked de-glycopeptides. Both N-linked intact glycopeptides and de-glycopeptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. From N-linked de-glycopeptides datasets, 764 N-linked glycoproteins, 1,699 N-linked glycosites and 3,328 unique N-linked de-glycopeptides were identified. Four types of N-linked glycosylation motifs (NXS/T/C/V, Xâ‰ P) were used to recognize the N-linked de-glycopeptides. The spectra of these N-linked de-glycopeptides were utilized for N-linked de-glycopeptides library construction and identification of N-linked intact glycopeptides. A database containing 739 N-glycan masses was constructed and utilized during spectral library search for the identification of N-linked intact glycopeptides. In total, 526 N-linked glycoproteins, 1,036 N-linked glycosites, 22,677 N-linked intact glycopeptides and 738 N-glycan masses were identified under 1% FDR, representing the most in-depth serum N-glycoproteome identified by LC-MS/MS at N-linked intact glycopeptide level.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qingbo Shu"", ids = ""5064689""); list(name = ""Meng-jie Li"", ids = ""50652033""); list(name = ""Lian Shu"", ids = ""1509482307""); list(name = ""Zhiwu An"", ids = ""30935312""); list(name = ""Jizhen Wang"", ids = ""51116099""); list(name = ""Hao Lv"", ids = ""145617251""); list(name = ""Ming Yang"", ids = ""51331222""); list(name = ""Tanxi Cai"", ids = ""6271555""); list(name = ""Tony Hu"", ids = ""2506830""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817032""); list(name = ""Fuquan Yang"", ids = ""152622246"")",,,Molecular & Cellular Proteomics : MCP,19,672 - 689

A key computational challenge when processing these data is to distinguish libraries for real cells from empty droplets. Existing methods for cell calling set a minimum threshold on the total unique molecular identifier (UMI) count for each library, which indiscriminately discards cell libraries with low UMI counts. Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method has greater power than existing approaches for detecting cell libraries with low UMI counts, while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. We also apply our method to real data, where we show that the use of our method results in the retention of distinct cell types that would otherwise have been discarded.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Aaron T.

In the patient with burn injury, older age, larger percentage of total body surface area (TBS) burned, and inhalation injury are established risk factors for death, which typically results from multisystem organ failure and sepsis, implicating burn-induced immune dysregulation as a contributory mechanism. We sought to identify early transcriptomic changes in circulating leukocytes underlying increased mortality associated with these three risk factors.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective analysis of the Glue Grant database. From 2003 to 2010, 324 adults with 20% or greater TBS burned were prospectively enrolled at five US burn centers, and 112 provided blood samples within 1 week after burn. RNA was extracted from pooled leukocytes for hybridization onto Affymetrix HU133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips. A multivariate regression model was constructed to determine risk factors for mortality. Testing for differential gene association associated with age, burn size, and inhalation injury was based on linear models using a fold change threshold of 1.5 and false discovery rate of 0.05.


RESULTS
After adjusting for potential confounders, age greater than 60 years (relative risk [RR], 4.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.93-6.99), burn size greater than 40% TBS (RR, 4.24; 95% CI, 2.61-6.91), and inhalation injury (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.35-3.21) were independently associated with mortality. No genes were differentially expressed in association with age greater than 60 years or inhalation injury. Fifty-one probe sets representing 39 unique genes were differentially expressed in leukocytes from patients with burn size greater than 40% TBS; these genes were associated with platelet activation and degranulation/exocytosis, and gene-set enrichment analysis suggested increased cellular proliferation and down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines.


CONCLUSION
Among adults with large burns, older age, increasing burn size, and inhalation injury have a modest effect on the leukocyte transcriptome in the context of the ""genomic storm"" induced by a 20% or greater than TBS burned. The 39-gene signature we identified may provide novel targets for the development of therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with burns greater than 40% TBS.

184930c973e78fa7fcebfc92411e82a0279abaa0,Effect of single post-ovulatory administration of mifepristone (RU486) on transcript profile during the receptive period in human endometrium.,"Progesterone regulates uterine function during the luteal phase and is essential for the acquisition of endometrial receptivity. The objective of the present study was to identify endometrial transcripts whose expression is altered during the window of implantation after the administration of 200 mg of the antiprogestin mifepristone, 48 h after the LH peak (LH+2, LH+0=LH peak), and to determine the relationship of these transcripts with those regulated during the acquisition of receptivity. Endometrial samples were obtained in LH+7 from seven women of proven fertility, each one contributing with one cycle treated with placebo and another with mifepristone. Additionally, endometrial samples were obtained in LH+2 and LH+7 during a single untreated spontaneous cycle from seven normal fertile women as a reference. DNA microarrays were used to identify transcripts significantly regulated (defined as â‰¥ 2.0-fold change with false discovery rate below 1% using t-test) with the administration of mifepristone vs placebo, or during the transition from pre-receptive to receptive (LH+2 vs LH+7). Approximately 2000 transcripts were significantly regulated in both comparisons (mifepristone vs placebo and LH+2 vs LH+7), but only 777 of them were coincident and displayed opposite regulation except for 25. The mRNA level for eight selected genes regulated by mifepristone was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. We conclude that not all changes in endometrial transcript levels occurring in the transition from LH+2 to LH+7 seem to be regulated by the progesterone receptor and âˆ¼ 37% of the genes whose transcript levels changed by effect of mifepristone could be associated with the acquisition of receptivity.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Catherina A.

90fc652fd86d8060e3bb694f7badcf5489ff56c9,Incorporating Prior Knowledge about Genetic Variants into the Analysis of Genetic Association Data: An Empirical Bayes Approach,"In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), the probability that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is not associated with a disease is its local false discovery rate (LFDR). The LFDR for each SNP is relative to a reference class of SNPs. For example, the LFDR of an exonic SNP can vary widely depending on whether it is considered relative to the separate reference class of other exonic SNPs or relative to the combined reference class of all SNPs in the data set. As a result, the analysis of the data based on the combined reference class might indicate that a specific exonic SNP is associated with the disease, while using the separate reference class indicates that it is not associated, or vice versa. To address that, we introduce empirical Bayes methods that simultaneously consider a combined reference class and a separate reference class. Our simulation studies indicate that the proposed methods lead to improved performance. The new maximum entropy method achieves that by depending on the separate class when it has enough SNPs for reliable LFDR estimation and depending solely on the combined class otherwise.

30a132da5ab24430bb4218811e4304d846e7bdd4,Improved detection of common variants in coronary artery disease and blood pressure using a pleiotropy cFDR method,"Plenty of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for coronary artery disease (CAD) and blood pressure (BP). However, these SNPs only explain a small proportion of the heritability of two traits/diseases. Although high BP is a major risk factor for CAD, the genetic intercommunity between them remain largely unknown. To recognize novel loci associated with CAD and BP, a genetic-pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) method was applied on two summary statistics of CAD and BP from existing GWASs. Stratified Q-Q and fold enrichment plots showed a high pleiotropic enrichment of SNPs associated with two traits. Adopting a cFDR of 0.05 as a threshold, 55 CAD-associated loci (25 variants being novel) and 47 BP loci (18 variants being novel) were identified, 25 of which were pleiotropic loci (13 variants being novel) for both traits. Among the 32 genes these 25 SNPs were annotated to, 20 genes were newly detected compared to previous GWASs. This study showed the cFDR approach could improve gene discovery by incorporating GWAS datasets of two related traits. These findings may provide novel understanding of etiology relationships between CAD and BP.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiangjie Mao"", ids = ""151257894""); list(name = ""Qiang Zhang"", ids = ""143721012""); list(name = ""Fei Xu"", ids = ""145162309""); list(name = ""Pan Gao"", ids = ""50735410""); list(name = ""Nan Sun"", ids = ""48000411""); list(name = ""Bo Wang"", ids = ""46270429""); list(name = ""Qixin Tang"", ids = ""151178442""); list(name = ""Yibin Hao"", ids = ""151261064""); list(name = ""Changqing Sun"", ids = ""152873476"")",,5cc190b9566df5dd679fa568a28d4eb6828226dd; 9e803e8b45788f6c5519cbc4ebd0109008d10349; cd9f10f8dfd11273fce6537b3bb205dd82bb7641; 7ba4db69dc65268849cc08d347cb3e095c95753b; bf52b702987f9e32ff9b4036a2e5b00f65439c7d; 27d1ae6f0355750f307c34786f381fb7b63e00f7; e56958aa717c60311419673036b0b744787c9a46; 26f17b2c9e083345f8ae89d22a18e48cdfddb02a; 4c1c329064ccc4dc0648a1e9e204c898e9b4e1f4; a4834d5d528c7aa9f85f3356395b5492231b9b72; f14f75a56b1891100d84ed02537e0de92c1dea1c; fc76a1ebd7756baa3db7e8bdd66b2327326f543b; 14cfa13f7e5ebcf84458b0fe9998d1bc5e773152; 29e530fbad2f5de99f86d21cbb0eeb4869423294; d0a7b1e06cb8d6da8b3be2815cdbca811af30e68; d57e7591068e296fa337b81c4710f747b7a2fd22; 89ce834ad05b9d17d717af9e23092e77a183742f; 9bcd76058ef3b7b2c791201da38e563c0abeb266; 61fbdfb6468885d726047ac340844b814d69e116; 91c71c82356b101042502e2f80efe6a454d7ff09; 68ba35b2ef2568e0874cdab6511526583b844c70; 6996656524d7039276867056c313dbcd1399e4d1; 0b4fe3043edb0f726ba6eaace083536cdb11b995; cee5c856959edc3b97c645397bc9c00f649f439d; 87f130e94365e433e55a9c9e282504d746a25680; 32d07f5ee4ccb22b497fffcf6ed149f56f0890ea; c88b9a806abc97871e30e29ae3ef483cb15e4e35; 4e6cca2b35fac5ec3eff57a356850161c60cee36; 65ae34915b43cd7c0030c74a7c2def7b321bed89; 1a4a1ce271563985bb5d1e26ab6c3cd9a9720c58; 3c8688981f4754ad897dd1e68a793d875534c899; cfb84c90538bab6ae1d4234533dbb7c4cf82f10f; 721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef; 9960e81a6a5d89ac3afa8f150f4116cba93b3a8c; 0cb7796010d4c67556a9dbb29e2a8faf3a283252; 8bad53bc47f6757f9a03cf9cb40b2e4ea4c72d30; 19f6f3d65279d8566e23d7e82e6d5754baffb4d6; 3ad0510c97dd7dd989dc51f726cafe443b31ef4a; 357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55; 0c758609bcaf33e695e8967dc2cc657c04e8671f; f1c8ac613b59abd978bbffcf6ecf5b6b4dd1b86f; 1f203d5853e9f488664e77057c9c0bb161cf4327; 6fdc08f8708718ee3edc03d2ab8cec5a60dabb3a; 367aacce3d30a9f76cc5c5a54f91cd29df7d236b; 7811e2812420aebc83c6c05cd7b73fc3399f3886; c4faa5284fa959d54cfabccc7be5b50f23def1fd; 8e1241e3583452641cd7201915d88854145c5a72; be57fcc9cf91c2289132c76d235e951f803139c2; 8fa7eaf1fb37ee22f5f0b0b23a45eac13f7574d3; fa9ab19c55f7296ab309f43ecc6434a3458a0de0; 66244832e1d0ad30408f18edff5e9ab5bc86807d; 386b0d9046097113eed56f86e3ddadadc64e7969; a24fa8adb014c55d3099c56e7b900de99a0ac5ec; 35b1c4fb4572e2ac98cae63c0d3d6b7beca8e1b0; b8acebc8f0d8674cb2a5244a2739b90e27716e93; cd034733f8b06e6326d7366ed16fb7f81dd8a12a; 4ecc1eeb07c8a3d493d2e370ad40d260a35782d6; 5bfa1d279e703a65f28841af97e66ecb212fb527; b4f0aa17b0a9c75e8b5a0c9f0fac25c5daed7d98; 1018674a361826d31f3e69f2941160e5ac4ff517; 84b55184bb8872dd4df3c6c3efdaf5845fae143b,Scientific Reports,9,

Copy number variations (CNVs) are one form of human genetic variations that have been linked with complex diseases and often occur at different frequencies among African Americans and Caucasian populations. Here, we aimed to investigate whether CNVs with differential frequencies can contribute to health disparities from the perspective of gene networks. We inferred network clusters from human gene/protein networks based on two different data sources. We then evaluated each network cluster for the occurrences of known pathogenic genes and genes located in CNVs with different population frequencies, and used false discovery rates to rank network clusters. This approach let us identify five clusters enriched with known pathogenic genes and with genes located in CNVs with different frequencies between African Americans and Caucasians. These clustering patterns predict two candidate causal genes located in four populationspecific CNVs that play potential roles in health disparities.",2015,,"list(name = ""Yi Jiang"", ids = ""152771693""); list(name = ""Hong Qin"", ids = ""145199626""); list(name = ""Li Yang"", ids = ""49576186"")",,8bdfefc4d88f48e99e108a9b3185fbec1a5b1e8e; 6a79847d4ad7b5088aa7b041bc9eb229086d35c0; 6876f72063ae46697ef6c646c656499169adf5f6; ec3df9c4dc803d3db3fbec3d4b828af282765d98; 4feee63aa5dda8b0d052130d089829601169463c; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; 236960eca2792e5f51b00b6e4daaf7fdc02fa07c; 8bda3d7a2608eae656628874e52e48bac963a5a5; aebb78079d9a81d843344e87df9f21d8755ea639; befc8b8f3865cfbb35634ea4db4aeca20a339d71; 056ee7e52cb0aa711d1ff0689cb111383aa9d86d; 0d1fecf2b9e5e0f154923ecc26cc543341a84c7e; 6c81e44e7e6565c9853badd198e50a0f19523dbd; 139710823d7b0d3d32b60b9307e26feac375e40a; acbe851bbcc7288f59784d9878407173f1edffdf; 4fa42320c1ee140548c471f76dd8a30dc6fa82db; 11f647b95a7c9a94c346cd8dc53987105cb0f7c1; 93aeef23c1679eb0b34a289bb97c785a6f44c424; fb39910b70a3db7821fa784b7c3bfd33d002ff00; 86342a7eb767e8e939ed54a96754dc155bc11aee; fc30910a8bf8daa3256284580b1dfe98b32d3559; 76b97dd2112a4e4c58690fae54287fa632b87590; b85ed323c9f06f4ccbb302a008ed93b016fcefcb; 60add4035c2b6d4b9888cb1028c31e6bed793d60; d4b82022469c0c9bad0ec0495e649521007dfa2f; 8e3eba4769f5df7a07d5c0537e55a54aa3a51aa2; 272a9fae1241c506b4c2d579b0b0eb4bf677224f; fc90bd571818dacf9f19d4198c6e00d948632d2b; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 0340f2fa88e15c48361ca8d3c4b29f6faa8c2276; 01cf71b54008d6aa2207000fc94aa447f7300a5e; 5a9c1693739980bbca0e668ebcc249ad8504e525; 47e502d3f677b9995f2c4909dc5c0f6455ae3db2; bca8f932f277d6ffd69a2c3bd8c279d70f908334; e63937184c8bc856924c06a7c584c8c48c573fc8; 586f34b1944f2796fb3b2bad46b566a6091a1c5e; 5e54f0a1bda9c1134c0f64f9ad266b44773a9783,PeerJ,3,

The raw data produced by the a technique known as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), consists of integer counts of reverse transcribed cDNA fragment reads mapped onto each gene or transcript isoform in a reference genome or transcriptome. Many software packages exist for analysing RNA-seq datasets consisting of tables of mapped read counts from biological or technical replicate experiments under two or more conditions, the purpose being to detect which genes are differentially expressed between conditions. Two state-of-the-art packages, DESeq and edgeR, are based on a negative binomial model of read counts. Our tests with simulated data constructed according to the statistical model assumed by these packages reveal that both packages generate a non-uniform p-value spectrum from null-hypothesis data. We demonstrate how specific knowledge of the non-uniformity can be exploited to develop a graphical technique based on the Storey-Tibshirani method for improving estimates of p-values and false discovery rates in databases where differential expression is present. We have developed an add-on package for DESeq and edgeR, called Polyfit, which implements this method, and evaluate its performance against DESeq, edgeR and another recently introduced package, PoissonSeq, using simulated data.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Conrad J.

039fb232896b72be48c4798da9ffb5b6f0f507f0,Capillary electrophoresis (CE) peak detection using a wavelet transform technique,"Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) is a separation technique that can be used as a sample pre-treatment step in chemical analysis. When coupled with a detection technique, identification of chemical species can be performed on the basis of the elution signals. However, the sensor signals are often complicated by high signal noise, varying baseline and overlapping peaks. There is thus a need for a signal processing technique capable of robustly detecting peaks in acquired sensor data. Here, we report on an algorithm that utilises the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for the detection of analyte peaks. The algorithm that has been developed makes use of a wavelet equal to the first derivative of a Gaussian function and has been successfully applied to data obtained from a CCD sensor fabricated on a polymer microfluidic separation chip. The algorithm operates by taking the CWT of the sensor response. It then analyses patterns in the local maximum and minimum points evident across scales in the CWT coefficients to find the peaks in the time series data. The performance of two versions of the algorithm have been compared for synthetic data sets each with known baseline, peaks and noise. The improved algorithm has been shown to successfully find peaks with a high sensitivity and low False Discovery Rate within a range of sensitivities.",2008,Mathematics; Engineering,"list(name = ""Robert Stewart"", ids = ""144353430""); list(name = ""Andrew Wee"", ids = ""145151922""); list(name = ""David B.

Crucial PDâ€‘associated genes were predicted using the Genetic Association Database in the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and sequence alignment. Furthermore, transcription factors (TFs) of the crucial PDâ€‘associated genes were predicted, and proteinâ€‘protein interactions (PPIs) between the crucial PDâ€‘associated genes were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins. Additionally, another dataset of PD was used to validate the expression of crucial PDâ€‘associated genes. A total of 670 DEGs (398 upregulated and 272 downregulated genes) were identified in the PD samples. Of these, 10 DEGs enriched in pathways associated with the nervous system were predicted to be crucial in PD, including Câ€‘Xâ€‘C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and NCL adaptor protein 2 (NCK2). All 10 genes were associated with neuron development and differentiation. They were simultaneously modulated by multiple TFs, including GATA, E2F and E4 promoterâ€‘binding protein 4. The PPI networks showed that DCC and CXCR4 were hub proteins. The DCCâ€‘netrin 1â€‘roundabout guidance receptor 2â€‘slit guidance ligand 1 interaction pathway, and several genes, including TOX high mobility group box family member 4, kinase insert domain receptor and zymogen granule protein 16B, which interacted with CXCR4, were novel findings. Additionally, CXCR4 and NCK2 were upregulated in another dataset (GSE8397) of PD.

69adeab1a8eb586019fc43be9ce72a9b21d3d0bb,Brain imaging correlates of mild cognitive impairment and early dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia is increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia in patients with T2DM, using advanced multimodal MRI.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Twenty-five patients (â‰¥70 years) with T2DM and MCI (nÂ =Â 22) or early dementia (nÂ =Â 3) were included. The reference group consisted of 23 patients with T2DM with intact cognition. All patients underwent a 3Â T MRI. Brain volumes and white matter hyperintensity volumes were obtained with automated segmentation methods. White matter connectivity was assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography. Infarcts and microbleeds were rated visually. Compared to patients without cognitive impairment, those with impairment had a lower grey matter volume (effect size: -0.58, p=0.042), especially in the right temporal lobe and subcortical brain regions (effect sizes: -0.45 to -0.91, false discovery rate corrected pÂ <Â 0.05). White matter volume (effect size: -0.47, pÂ =Â 0.11) and white matter connectivity (effect size: 0.55, pÂ =Â 0.054) were also reduced in patients with versus without cognitive impairment, albeit not statistically significant. White matter hyperintensity volumes and occurrence of other vascular lesions did not differ between the two patient groups.


CONCLUSION
In patients with T2DM, grey matter atrophy rather than vascular brain injury appears to be the primary imaging correlate of MCI and early dementia.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Onno N Groeneveld"", ids = ""4568555""); list(name = ""Yael D Reijmer"", ids = ""2669068""); list(name = ""Rutger Heinen"", ids = ""40417784""); list(name = ""Hugo J.

In addition, behavior has an impact on cattle productivity, welfare and adaptation. The aim of the present study was to infer quantitative genetic and genomic mechanisms contributing to natural dual-purpose cow behavior in grazing systems. In this regard, we genotyped five dual-purpose breeds for a dense SNP marker panel from four different European countries. All cows from the across-country study were equipped with the same electronic recording devices. In this regard, we analyzed 97,049 longitudinal sensor behavior observations from 319 local dual-purpose cows for rumination, feeding, basic activity, high active, not active and ear temperature. According to the specific sensor behaviors and following a welfare protocol, we computed two different welfare indices. For genomic breed characterizations and multi-breed genome-wide association studies, sensor traits and test-day production records were merged with 35,826 SNP markers per cow. For the estimation of variance components, we used the pedigree relationship matrix and a combined similarity matrix that simultaneously included both pedigree and genotypes. Heritabilities for feeding, high active and not active were in a moderate range from 0.16 to 0.20. Estimates were very similar from both relationship matrix-modeling approaches and had quite small standard errors. Heritabilities for the remaining sensor traits (feeding, basic activity, ear temperature) and welfare indices were lower than 0.09. Five significant SNPs on chromosomes 11, 17, 27 and 29 were associated with rumination, and two different SNPs significantly influenced the sensor traits ""not active"" (chromosome 13) and ""feeding"" (chromosome 23). Gene annotation analyses inferred 22 potential candidate genes with a false discovery rate lower than 20%, mostly associated with rumination (13 genes) and feeding (8 genes). Mendelian randomization based on genomic variants (i.e., the instrumental variables) was used to infer causal inference between an exposure and an outcome. Significant regression coefficients among behavior traits indicate that all specific behavioral mechanisms contribute to similar physiological processes. The regression coefficients of rumination and feeding on milk yield were 0.10 kg/% and 0.12 kg/%, respectively, indicating their positive influence on dual-purpose cow productivity. Genomically, an improved welfare behavior of grazing cattle, i.e., a higher score for welfare indices, was significantly associated with increased fat and protein percentages.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tong Yin"", ids = ""50154259""); list(name = ""M.

015ecb7465ca8d6c0d1246a3b4882db6e4cad172,Gene expression variation in the adult human retina,"Despite evidence that differences in gene expression levels contribute significantly to phenotypic variation across individuals, there has been only limited effort to study gene expression variation in human tissue. To characterize expression variation in the normal human retina, we utilized a custom retinal microarray to analyze 33 normal retinas from 19 donors, aged 29-90 years. Statistical models were designed to separate and quantify biological and technical sources of variation, including age, gender, eye laterality, gene function and age-by-gender interaction. Although the majority of the 9406 genes analyzed showed relatively stable expression levels across different donors (for an average gene the expression level value of 95 out of a 100 individuals fell within a 1.23-fold range), 2.6% of genes showed significant donor-to-donor variation, with a false discovery rate of 10%. The mean expression ratio standard deviation was 0.15 Â± 0.8, log 2 , with a range of 0.09-0.99. Genes selectively expressed in photoreceptors showed higher expression variation than other gene classes. Gender, age and other donor-specific factors contributed significantly to the expression variation of multiple genes, and groups of genes with an age- and gender-associated expression pattern were identified. Our findings show that a significant fraction of gene expression variation in the normal human retina is attributable to identifiable biological factors. The greater expression variability of many genes central to retinal function (including photoreceptor-specific genes) may be partially explained by the dynamics of the vision process, and raises the possibility that photoreceptor gene expression levels may contribute to phenotypic diversity across normal adult retinas. In addition, as such diversity may result in different levels of disease susceptibility, exploring its sources may provide insights into the pathogenesis of retinal disease.",2003,Biology,"list(name = ""Itay Chowers"", ids = ""32099688""); list(name = ""Dongmei Liu"", ids = ""48929007""); list(name = ""Ronald H.

d1cb41a6e030b7db9a6db2b48e20971d57241984,A method to associate all possible combinations of genetic and environmental factors using GxE landscape plot,"UNLABELLED
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and linkage analysis has identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to disease. There are many unknown SNPs whose minor allele frequencies (MAFs) as low as 0.005 having intermediate effects with odds ratio between 1.5~3.0. Low frequency variants having intermediate effects on disease pathogenesis are believed to have complex interactions with environmental factors called gene-environment interactions (GxE). Hence, we describe a model using 3D Manhattan plot called GxE landscape plot to visualize the association of p-values for gene-environment interactions (GxE). We used the Gene-Environment iNteraction Simulator 2 (GENS2) program to simulate interactions between two genetic loci and one environmental factor in this exercise. The dataset used for training contains disease status, gender, 20 environmental exposures and 100 genotypes for 170 subjects, and p-values were calculated by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test on known data. Subsequently, we created a 3D GxE landscape plot of negative logarithm of the association of p-values for all the possible combinations of genetic and environmental factors with their hierarchical clustering. Thus, the GxE landscape plot is a valuable model to predict association of p-values for GxE and similarity among genotypes and environments in the context of disease pathogenesis.

Automated curation of this list using an inbuilt randomised database searching tool with false discovery rate set at 1% significantly reduced this list to 86 proteins. Additional manual curation resulted in the final positive identification of 75 proteins. These identified proteins were functionally classified and physiochemically characterised. This led to the identification of a number of proteins involved in cell structure, inflammation, and the innate immune response.

The pathogenesis associated with IAD, however, remains unclear. In this study, we aim to explore the encephalic functional characteristics of IAD adolescents at rest using functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We adopted a graph-theoretic approach to investigate possible disruptions of functional connectivity in terms of network properties including small-worldness, efficiency, and nodal centrality on 17 adolescents with IAD and 16 socio-demographically matched healthy controls. False discovery rate-corrected parametric tests were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of group-level network topological differences. In addition, a correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships between functional connectivity and clinical measures in the IAD group. Our results demonstrate that there is significant disruption in the functional connectome of IAD patients, particularly between regions located in the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes. The affected connections are long-range and inter-hemispheric connections. Although significant alterations are observed for regional nodal metrics, there is no difference in global network topology between IAD and healthy groups. In addition, correlation analysis demonstrates that the observed regional abnormalities are correlated with the IAD severity and behavioral clinical assessments. Our findings, which are relatively consistent between anatomically and functionally defined atlases, suggest that IAD causes disruptions of functional connectivity and, importantly, that such disruptions might link to behavioral impairments.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chong-Yaw Wee"", ids = ""145191237""); list(name = ""Zhimin Zhao"", ids = ""50144681""); list(name = ""Pew-Thian Yap"", ids = ""144931047""); list(name = ""Guorong Wu"", ids = ""46531894""); list(name = ""Feng Shi"", ids = ""1686093""); list(name = ""True Price"", ids = ""39310157""); list(name = ""Yasong Du"", ids = ""66448175""); list(name = ""Jianrong Xu"", ids = ""7169641""); list(name = ""Yan Zhou"", ids = ""46433305""); list(name = ""Dinggang Shen"", ids = ""144986260"")",8ed2681bb94624328b3b424995972cfe3ea1018f; 7f3023511be706f370f03d406eb245d055524534; 3da5c04a02b1eed8b3ecaf1d18d15559a3b7de2c; e31de52a9fff5c420891abbae06414cf135b3baa; 47377ed5945955ef54a55510d06df77d2c76c8f0; 937dce97082990d5567242b16e0957f796ac7ec1; 2615723030615a05320254cec8c0df9d61a8ca1a; deba3a893decd25fad5359286bca6dc523ef85ef; 034f3d3a4770f679cd34e242fd91b70ea1648121; 107110b934550bbb95dfe355de37aea3f6773a10; 65b939c919ebeced59c8a11621d5ec81d6b2065a; 670c310f77978fdaadd6526a7bd782254f3e4acc; 62e16eb0e5feb0e14780989e9ac10bde95c79720; 905dd5acddd6ea4849733dc07d443a0864c5b124; ab9e7f6987081081bef1edf5d593d389b9d67f62; 82da5f3b3315823414ead2f539fbe5003009af40; 05240387ee49469ed53578932f983b76870b61eb; 304c90e350f991274a81860a59ab057dfffba712; c91bdc0fc4f1ed0a0afcc594176dd8334728465e; 3bf226e00116274d9fb13db386bda692135c0ab5; 0333b19f97760d5bc485ca3db77e2e3d7fb88b38; 41cd257123e06f6f25d1a148d8a76ffb5b28149e; 246cfa1014998cface8c9157fc56854dbecced22; 1a7a550c5276440fca20096d14d8f5d4ba53db68; fd34ccd3db88e1b50e34cb1840253bd6f5d4aed1; da4d85251e5b29f84309d320eff234a3c06858da; 9e198871fa28e4e2caa34d5e352d3b8462149c5e; 487971d8e1a0601f2f912328c0cb983cc9a6fbc3; 473cc2f7b910d9bebb8c6b0362931436e7124b9e,04b309af262cf2643daa93a34c1ba177cd6e7a85; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; 2fd21381669eb852d5e1dff90195bfec2646fdbd; 7432f1ada9efbfce2b00e43051363a297a109d55; 9a82604c8f67236f621584fd46bfc1a3bb1ebe3b; 7043bde3caf6643e1e34244560db41806754ba98; da527c6132a523c054ace20bf4a91b42122827b5; e7e3ee53ac26d03789e65811328d1b622a002e12; c5d69586d7e493226187b7258fda105e4626a5f9,PLoS ONE,9,
b2f85d6ec32d2f8ae7fe73c1e4c0643c5dd0a89f,Abstract 874: Autoantibody biomarker discovery in basal-like breast cancer using nucleic acid programmable protein array,"Background: Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is a rare aggressive subtype of breast cancer (âˆ¼10-20% of all BC) with high recurrence rates and poor prognosis. BLBC disproportionately affects African American and younger women, has a high growth rate and occurs at young ages. These factors render mammographic screening challenging, necessitating the development of new methods for BLBC9s early detection. Proteins released from small early tumors may only be present intermittently and get diluted to tiny concentrations in the blood, making them difficult to use as biomarkers. However, they can induce an autoantibody (AAb) response, which can amplify the signal and persist in the blood even if the antigen is gone. Accordingly, we assessed whether circulating AAbs could act as early detection biomarkers of BLBC. We have developed a sero-proteomic technology, called Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays (NAPPA), which tests the immune responses to thousands of proteins simultaneously. Results: Plasma samples were from the Polish Breast Cancer Study. BLBC patients were classified by immunohistochemical staining of ER-, PR-, HER2-, and either EGFR+ or CK5/6+. Case and control plasma were probed against âˆ¼10,000 full-length human proteins on NAPPA to discover informative antigens, which were selected based on the following statistical metrics: 1) sensitivity at 95% specificity; 2) area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); 3) partial AUC above 95% specificity; 4) Welch9s t test. We then identified candidate AAbs in a training study combining the 800 top antigens on a single array. These arrays were screened with an independent training set of plasma from 50 each of BLBC cases and healthy controls, and 30 other BC cases. Preliminary analyses suggest 5 candidate biomarkers with sensitivities ranging from 26-32% at 94% specificity. The antigen list will be refined using AUC, and the sensitivity and partial AUC at 95%, 90% and 80% specificity levels. Permutation-based false discovery rates will be used to assess statistical significance, and the antigens will be combined into a biomarker panel using a random forests algorithm. Finally, we will test the individual markers and the antigen panel in a blinded independent validation set of 50 cases, 50 controls and 30 other BC cases. These tests will use cutoffs and algorithm determined entirely from the training data. We are assessing whether the candidate biomarkers are specific for cancer vs. controls and BLBC vs. other molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Summary: This describes the first immunoproteomic screen for AAb biomarkers of BLBC. Using protein microarrays displaying more than 10,000 folded unique human proteins, controls, BLBC and non-BLBC cases were tested in independent discovery and training stages identifying AAbs with potential diagnostic value. Blinded validation studies are in progress. Citation Format: Jie Wang, Jonine D. Figueroa, Garrick Wallstrom, Joshua Sampson, Eliseo Mendoza Garcia, Jason Steel, Jin Park, Karen S.

We hypothesized that biomarkers during pregnancy can identify pregnancies most at risk for development of PTL. An inflammation-induced mouse model of PTL was used. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to analyze and compare the plasma protein (PP) profile between CD-1 mice injected intrauterine with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or PBS on d 14.5 of gestation. The median differences of normalized PP peaks between the two groups were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test and the false discovery rate. In a second series of experiments, both groups of mice were injected with a lower dose of LPS. A total of 1665 peaks were detected. Thirty peaks were highly differentially expressed (p < 0.0001) between the groups. Two 11 kDa protein peaks were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS and confirmed to be mouse serum amyloid A (SAA) 1 and 2. Plasma SAA2 levels were increased in LPS-treated animals compared with controls and in LPS-treated animals that delivered preterm vs. those that delivered at term.

Consequently, the probability of at least one Type I error (if all null hypotheses are true) is 14% rather than 5% if the three tests are independent.

098f725ec9ef5a9958ff68b50051c64bef0c7689,SpliceRover: interpretable convolutional neural networks for improved splice site prediction,"Motivation: During the last decade, improvements in highâ€throughput sequencing have generated a wealth of genomic data. Functionally interpreting these sequences and finding the biological signals that are hallmarks of gene function and regulation is currently mostly done using automated genome annotation platforms, which mainly rely on integrated machine learning frameworks to identify different functional sites of interest, including splice sites. Splicing is an essential step in the gene regulation process, and the correct identification of splice sites is a major cornerstone in a genome annotation system. Results: In this paper, we present SpliceRover, a predictive deep learning approach that outperforms the stateâ€ofâ€theâ€art in splice site prediction. SpliceRover uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been shown to obtain cutting edge performance on a wide variety of prediction tasks. We adapted this approach to deal with genomic sequence inputs, and show it consistently outperforms already existing approaches, with relative improvements in prediction effectiveness of up to 80.9% when measured in terms of false discovery rate. However, a major criticism of CNNs concerns their â€˜black boxâ€™ nature, as mechanisms to obtain insight into their reasoning processes are limited. To facilitate interpretability of the SpliceRover models, we introduce an approach to visualize the biologically relevant information learnt. We show that our visualization approach is able to recover features known to be important for splice site prediction (binding motifs around the splice site, presence of polypyrimidine tracts and branch points), as well as reveal new features (e.g. several types of exclusion patterns near splice sites). Availability and implementation: SpliceRover is available as a web service. The prediction tool and instructions can be found at http://bioit2.irc.ugent.be/splicerover/.

Malaria rapid diagnostic test (MRDT) provides a good alternative to malaria microscopy diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This study therefore evaluated MRDT in private retail pharmacies (PRPs) as a critical step in community case malaria management.


METHODS
In a prospective, cross-over, validation survey at six PRPs in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, 1200 patients presenting with fever in the preceding 48 h were sampled. Fingerstick blood samples were collected for preparation of thick and thin blood films for malaria microscopy. Categorized patients (600 each) went through the processes of MRDT or presumptive diagnosis (PD) of malaria. The malaria disease prevalence of the study area was established. Selectivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) along with false discovery rate (FDR), and negative predictive value (NPV) along with the false omission rate (FOR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of MRDT were then calculated.


FINDINGS
While 43.0% tested positive using the MRDT, 57.0% tested negative. However, 62.0% MRDT-negative patients in addition to all the MRDT positives were given artemether-lumefantrine. Of those diagnosed by PD, 98.2% were prescribed with an antimalarial (microscopy however confirmed only 70.3% as positive). Se and Sp of the MRDT were 90.68 Â± 11.18% and 98.68 Â± 1.19%, respectively. Malaria prevalence was estimated to be 43.3%. PPV was 98.0%, FDR was 2.0%, NPV was 98.0%, FOR was 2.0%, and DOR was 2366.43.


CONCLUSION
Results highlighted good performance of MRDTs at PRPs which could inform decision toward its implementation.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rauf Audu"", ids = ""38517892""); list(name = ""Berko P Anto"", ids = ""6943609""); list(name = ""George Asumeng Koffuor"", ids = ""5716138""); list(name = ""Akua Afriyie Abruquah"", ids = ""5006982""); list(name = ""Kwame Ohene Buabeng"", ids = ""5602937"")",8ffc0b2584053fc20a100bc6c90282ee1fa08962,,Journal of Research in Pharmacy Practice,5,175 - 180
ac41e31ee2b60a14eef84e05b45ce08a5d0b3379,Bootstrap Inference for Network Construction with an Application to a Breast Cancer Microarray Study.,"Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) have been used to construct genetic regulatory networks where regularization techniques are widely used since the network inference usually falls into a high-dimension-low-sample-size scenario. Yet, finding the right amount of regularization can be challenging, especially in an unsupervised setting where traditional methods such as BIC or cross-validation often do not work well. In this paper, we propose a new method - Bootstrap Inference for Network COnstruction (BINCO) - to infer networks by directly controlling the false discovery rates (FDRs) of the selected edges. This method fits a mixture model for the distribution of edge selection frequencies to estimate the FDRs, where the selection frequencies are calculated via model aggregation. This method is applicable to a wide range of applications beyond network construction. When we applied our proposed method to building a gene regulatory network with microarray expression breast cancer data, we were able to identify high-confidence edges and well-connected hub genes that could potentially play important roles in understanding the underlying biological processes of breast cancer.",2013,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shuang Li"", ids = ""1700248""); list(name = ""Li Hsu"", ids = ""6546942""); list(name = ""Jie Peng"", ids = ""49430022""); list(name = ""Pei Wang"", ids = ""48319742"")",8311e74a2dc7ba0ff85c60898840309989ccc708; b21a0969e496c03e8bc6bdce04c0261e69fb964d; 02072741fcd51fcab219349ca241c6bc877e1d94; 8ac362539c327a436387eb97e076448a11a1b208; b91dfbdda0bec4e0b2d528e35ed5267af334e6b2; c950f8dee2d4425c4c4cfceb70fbee1a1247c99d; 83e84c20fe44d4ed62dc34d420edf7bcc4a102cc; eb77d9a0dd61046ae45e28bcecb6668401f43653; c0af985eb8b920deb434f56b96eee02b62719df7; 8789d94c5ee02acf56e91981f91a48e2eb061a41; 79de4c36042bd0c604f4029531ccbe771321bc0a; 3676202b4ded47a1438858d39d2758eeb33be140; 65742fc373f2c37cef4ea5fbb6a98da42d0ad082; 4a813d7f2fb81c692edd8e5a0b1fd4b90462fa2a; 8963209b68bc27ebe9f0be41e5ecf7659b46aa42; 148d6113ce2de6410a0caa0ee6e00a6affda59fc; a78b344255588b1c7ef5de835aa6df0979aca92f; ab2afbe0e13dd7458784b6afa764b11408864192; 8dc638446089c20844268cde63a855e01eb451b0; 8ad0766a86582cdcadf32257353b5f2d848cfd96; 61a207da55c2d881ea5c4de9dc86304542d66fd6,ca714be0404f3c99c2dee42214c170fc60546fe9; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 5a6bb6cca5e76012a5c6a772b09b088f24eb5e8b; 8a89d2a49c50f4d4818b24b6137891f99058969a; 00cce17fec8074e35d797c937b32452348237d8f; 4564b83db4afdf402f9f215bcde5f33fbc7609d3; 7485e08676a3ff72f194d2f5d82f60c50894ba20; 60c9fde279537205edfb251d7f5a8d41409e79c9; 84441d96adbc3fd365830f3df0a3c61e4d7c1d1a; 31c88a88c9603ec32b237128dec6feeb5713a5d5; d755531ce1db99bc439affee95f0f23f24e4024a; acb6c75d0196275968c4204adb5a5254eb297a88; 20ff319f83bd98c7343e8b84d9f32e2b5d92f39b; 8232d0e1aedd60144f928f50036ca0fd8757c149,The annals of applied statistics,7 1,"

Although tetracycline mechanisms of resistance are well known, the role of metabolism in bacterial reaction to antibiotic stress is still an important assignment and could contribute to the understanding of tetracycline related stress response. In this study, spectral counts-based label free quantitative proteomics has been applied to study the response to tetracycline of the environmental-borne Escherichia coli EcAmb278 isolate soluble proteome. A total of 1484 proteins were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry at a false discovery rate threshold of 1%, of which 108 were uniquely identified under absence of tetracycline whereas 126 were uniquely identified in presence of tetracycline. These proteins revealed interesting difference in e.g. proteins involved in peptidoglycan-based cell wall proteins and energy metabolism. Upon treatment, 12 proteins were differentially regulated showing more than 2-fold change and p<0.05 (p value corrected for multiple testing). This integrated study using high resolution mass spectrometry based label-free quantitative proteomics to study tetracycline antibiotic response in the soluble proteome of resistant E. coli provides novel insight into tetracycline related stress.


SIGNIFICANCE
The lack of new antibiotics to fight infections caused by multidrug resistant microorganisms has motivated the use of old antibiotics, and the search for new drug targets. The evolution of antibiotic resistance is complex, but it is known that agroecosystems play an important part in the selection of antibiotic resistance bacteria. Tetracyclines are still used as phytopharmaceutical agents in crops, selecting resistant bacteria and changing the ecology of farm soil. Little is known about the metabolic response of genetically resistant populations to antibiotic exposure. Indeed, to date there are no quantitative tetracycline resistance studies performed with the latest generation of high resolution mass spectrometers allowing high mass accuracy in both MS and MS/MS scans. Here, we report the proteome profiling of a soil-borne Escherichia coli upon tetracycline stress, so that this new perspective could provide a broaden understanding of the metabolic responses of E. coli to a widely used antibiotic.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniela Jones-Dias"", ids = ""1398119496""); list(name = ""Ana Sofia Carvalho"", ids = ""26366140""); list(name = ""Ines B Moura"", ids = ""145344264""); list(name = ""Vera Manageiro"", ids = ""5586079""); list(name = ""Gilberto Igrejas"", ids = ""6123039""); list(name = ""Manuela CaniÃ§a"", ids = ""4621716""); list(name = ""Rune Matthiesen"", ids = ""2489943"")",c1b37901e2fa010b6897957335c2cc74a702952d; 4bdec966656e29f012aa30a07e73be49b700332d; f549f31c97e22e0cd12bb9582ea78ce3e14bea60,639d8298ea3b2db2a2978c1737a3ae746dfb6b64; 80a911595b8d7686638519cb1620c7c8cf8525ce; f8f009bef59b96720bf48c00c52033d86b4d0644; d5b374aa33458fb55a26f07164df5291c7b48bec; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 644cc7f6990bf3a02e3bcb48930eb9cbf9ed6c03; c24b11a00b4c9dbbf3afaede5d8c480e36d10de8; 78d6b6aaf0620fea674225f476777c2f390c8bc9; 94b5632ced591ee623872a47e64797ba65b2b444; 25158653347e0ea91edfed2561028e5bceb53ab3; d6f47f8fc93fe63582c6285291da164fb8c64cad; b90680224e38103840155c2c68d8b46183d2f939; 47e2c872590de852de4796d0d95f09b1d4ed411a; 112d1b149f16a938d7b09e6ae04dd95dfdc2451a; d9c7495b14ae178efaff3464617f0dccba3f7051; d8f4638783628d0a7ceb3feb933b1956d8feda2d; 282170993105a9b99ce92166f30c9e5f8b938a8a; e93a1d37ad9683475103903aeef7ab115d134262; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 4b31544c8b4e4d8fdb797870db272f605993e454; 36b6ae3ca12b10ec8633a05059360e24a8b9f7ec; 5a2a2e53b1c8d9904aad443ec1c5abbef057f468; 8ec14cf642fb1c4e6866d36fdc75d6fc73758649; 431ab56abf0ea3373e571839a15c1775dd515eeb; d18635ac3132b600ebec5e9dc488451b77745cb1; f67d60395257d2a43a743b8a8c1662867380c7c2; 46d8b167e0c05a3ca01e280fe5660eeb36a90897; 5c3569d40e2933f21f2b8d143e5808284ccbe2db; fec776e59a83027b5e4aaf04a09af9b69384fb57; 2e74c326a8c4e3e184e08edaa3dc160882ccb886; 246ce20b5fd3eeffe6c24fa0c3eabf88f048247f; ba3edf892b91decc802e1046ecf186902b6913b5; fac96ee23b72b1bc277bb3636e449de336003e07; dc61fe445bc6db207793404b35e066582b6776c9; 0a4f23d4217154c0dd2497d552d0f874cb7c4074; 5633f58bdb3f4e848d6517623b607e6d4a6760cc; f6ec1747431252eda4498834e45247caa4a91b9d; 6257f0179a5ab91cbbd1a4bba2cc7daf557a6de7; 31cddc4a3cc7e0d9bd97319aa8589fedd949eb9e; 655ce0454f8a50d9834350caa018ad37e9f9b874; f3674f4d3a057aef34aa662c0d7c4d0e26e01275; 6a773ee66d6c9cdb6805eb885b1b9de9d28f65fe; a7560e619843867723de61131b0064e0c588c09b; 0ba6d5ad9385022ed93af2a8d9f045063cdffa22; 75c597d6af591696ef2c938b5555b7997b8b9191; 690ac4a5f685ff3fa42e4497582c95fad36b6011; f90c935f1c69ecd2f6d30fad0fdfc9bd7bc8a8a0; eeaa1af3556f71f75ad4101eaea8bc48aa4d0d78; 0a7c0cbdeec3ef2157c5c4f606f079542b2c56fb; 371edf998bbd169b42c47dfc1f4bcefdf7682158; e0f39e126abb363423a91053d963732beae5413b; ddd6ca592414515aa9e9556c08df218c3a1f4cda; 891c338994d6ca537a68be08febc47a416f5710a; 564e9fed54debc30985289ed612cb7b9d989a39c; 27b8642d5c825069e5f25a9b9444514b702f3da4; 0e4d137564319c88c719c8fa3abb7fb8a2beb603; 996a84e8d334d2f98abcc02f2757e5253014b34b; 1aea88b89ed24e9f8e4801904e51ef90b949748f; ef79285957a21ca7a8a608bdf148cea1c92e9f29; 51669f67074749100e467a4346ef31deaf5b658b; f67111fc43ebec40f7320cbe3cccb8bd967f881f; 5c58f0b18e4832804419b27ad71998083f03ed6e; 6b6aa7870fa6a51d9e9dc0f1c4f8b89c7f72f72d; 071ee98e36ff4e3d4ff9ef6aa1d12f489b9b36f6; 77ff0bb96b1d085fe284c0a5d87d1d109001afcd; 8b0418de83939ad9c63dc486c6972654cf9dac57; 3abcfa929f4abae668404e750f143f8fd5ae1d2d; 3402b3921d8c2a4de001762e3a7bf40bb76493d8; 5e627d62f464056150f4806e8f0d6c76d4b83087; 8ace593df0228e3167064b6d3c92737a907da63f; 7117d865b65f03c110d22aad7590434fc4e7ce85; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 004fe629151a40d347abd9580ebc3fca2b7e167a,Journal of proteomics,156,"

The beauty and simplicity of the motif gives hope to detecting coiled-coil regions with reasonable accuracy and precision in any protein sequence. Here, we re-evaluated the most commonly used coiled-coil prediction tools with respect to the most comprehensive reference data set available, the entire Protein Data Base (PDB), down to each amino acid and its secondary structure. Apart from the thirtyfold difference in number of predicted coiled-coils the tools strongly vary in their predictions, across structures and within structures. The evaluation of the false discovery rate and Matthews correlation coefficient, a widely used performance metric for imbalanced data sets, suggests that the tested tools have only limited applicability for large data sets. Coiled-coil predictions strongly impact the functional characterization of proteins, are used for functional genome annotation, and should therefore be supported and validated by additional information.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Dominic Simm"", ids = ""1731847""); list(name = ""Klas Hatje"", ids = ""1724668""); list(name = ""Stephan Waack"", ids = ""1742534""); list(name = ""Martin Kollmar"", ids = ""1680961"")",,3029b2b26e89c554906d6aeffcad71bfd2841280; c68c72d12534adaab0389b123f3d1aa1c43f5c09; 7cee9a7c53d0b89f35004a06716b043b9b4d636e; 9218c7b13a9a3935236ace940496c2a98e295a55; 225ba9111ed4b4e0f5bbe12c69e7235e353ff3ff; b93eba28454e4c1e3351053ab300f90bb764bf1e; 6dfe6f0674cca0b9655bb3c1beae0a1fcf0e1935; 6d95c2cf4ea15912d04ab671cf1b98b7b80a9853; 0b361425a2c73f0e3826c88184d00ae4a91dbe15; 5ef2cf7b7aa6f7e44488d5db5409ef7f76b9ef9a; 8445a6a2923553a57047363baedaf634ace4657e; 131da6da9edec8a63867ab7348f1a939e0b7fd6b; 69a88be296e4d31541212ce1cd7ba47dacdc5046; 6806fe4a47310f6961cdaeca17fca6aed513d33f; a78b3abbaa9dbd1259161f327a05a2fbd483c549; 155345976aa505a10a45e9119f2853df4d7999d7; 67080275c2f525632c88cf8bec8612acc6963372; 6404260c51a4bf3a91c1b53dea1868ac63cd2ee0; 9f33ae0160e3aa0c7fe9f645b9e9b2a92966f9cb; d12699daa7954356dda616cebe46494c93aa6bf3; 3ab4aeb3a98a0dd0077590c963f9df14e692fdcf; f237e3038a1cdedacd4eb4402d6332f1eaf7fd41; bcf2f93a4a292980cfc0827b6217df3136f81477; 8569404863477652436a3f1694758a3ac766de03; 6f0f61ebd0b4c0b3bd5b4a3ab080666595e374d0; c73d64d3373af16ba32790a438d95b11ab773ac1; 28209ca406970f679bb6e4dc75a5c23eb698937c; 917ccfd45d01982df0959d71d1a2dfea11da614b; e51ab528ae94e35be174e75295123b35630a55d6; 34276b5992fa357c45204847a1ab67e493af5c30; 7bab92c2a1645141be1091a988f0dcd36cadf84d; 81658b06fc4d54d2d1a3ceae656ffed7012aa5ba; 8e85ae3476a26b22437b15683eba936ed3772f56; 83d97e8ad855f9dd51f791b1552b6a0f3387592d; ede87200045627fd262bbd7b589554e599905df1; b8131893d6b2f1cb8f0c60b559c146d1da05d77d; b7f516282ae82b9fc46fdf3e695f6c5d6b64095c; 5fe35de11a8fbd70a522e89e4266c18a85b92854; 8f88102ee81c59d9e0be7271ec9bed9028086e18; 5f8fe0581fe9d9c4026e7faab7af50432cf362e6; 225175e5b5a9a719e03f774934fabb0841b4eac4; 295372d70cd0738713d922ac958d885627bf5a93; 0ed8dace8c9b7b02fc0536a7007a6b0892f71c6e; b3672e3db17b3ad49598eecab7f71d8bd1b3a489; 43691d996bc4248cc263ad97d3a45dadc9fdc5aa; 43d482ad0153ae4cff1ca1a05627f74a002c8d42; 7c01aa04d5280c462a5e41cb55b62294e22f7f05; 51d8e2dc2d29de1be164931b96eeabbd35084359,bioRxiv,,
29e798ab52d635a4edc1aaf27565d635210ab61c,Step-up and step-down procedures controlling the number and proportion of false positives,"In multiple hypotheses testing, it is important to control the probability of rejecting ''true'' null hypotheses. A standard procedure has been to control the family-wise error rate (FWER), the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis. For large numbers of hypotheses, using FWER can result in very low power for testing single hypotheses. Recently, powerful multiple step FDR procedures have been proposed which control the ''false discovery rate'' (expected proportion of Type I errors). More recently, van der Laan et al. [Augmentation procedures for control of the generalized family-wise error rate and tail probabilities for the proportion of false positives. Statist. Appl. in Genetics and Molecular Biol. 3, 1-25] proposed controlling a generalized family-wise error rate k-FWER (also called gFWER(k)), defined as the probability of at least (k+1) Type I errors (k=0 for the usual FWER). Lehmann and Romano [Generalizations of the familywise error rate. Ann. Statist. 33(3), 1138-1154] suggested both a single-step and a step-down procedure for controlling the generalized FWER. They make no assumptions concerning the p-values of the individual tests. The step-down procedure is simple to apply, and cannot be improved without violation of control of the k-FWER. In this paper, by limiting the number of steps in step-down or step-up procedures, new procedures are developed to control k-FWER (and the proportion of false positives) PFP. Using data from the literature, the procedures are compared with those of Lehmann and Romano [Generalizations of the familywise error rate. Ann. Statist. 33(3), 1138-1154], and, under the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution of the test statistics, show considerable improvement in the reduction of the number and PFP.",2008,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Paul N.

5e9a3de3ff03a10c2f65ffee45c745287d0dea01,In-utero exposure to phenols and phthalates and the intelligence quotient of boys at 5 years,"BackgroundThere are concerns that developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phenolic compounds and phthalates could affect child cognitive function. Epidemiological studies tackling this question have mainly focused on phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A, but not on the other phenolic compounds. Our study aimed to assess the relationship between in-utero exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A and other phenolic compounds (parabens, triclosan, dichlorophenols and benzophenone-3) and the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of boys at 5â€“6Â years.MethodsIn 452 mother-son dyads from the French EDEN cohort, we measured 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenolic compounds (4 parabens, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A, 2 dichlorophenols and triclosan) in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. Verbal and performance IQ of children were assessed at 5â€“6Â years by a psychologist using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). We used adjusted Structural Equation Models (SEM) combined with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction to assess the associations between maternal urine phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations considered simultaneously and the boysâ€™ IQ.ResultsNo phenol or phthalate metabolite concentration was negatively associated with the boysâ€™ verbal or performance IQ (uncorrected p-values â‰¥0.09). Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate tended to be associated with increased verbal IQ (Î² = 0.136, 95% confidence interval, 0.01; 0.27). This association disappeared after correction for multiple comparison (corrected p-value, 0.71).ConclusionOur results did not provide evidence of an inverse association between in-utero exposure to phenols or phthalates and verbal and performance IQ among boys. Since phenols and phthalates may have sex-specific effects, these null findings cannot be generalized to girls.

66b4878e8b862167670585d59a8ed98c5798ca49,Comprehensive analysis of common and rare mitochondrial DNA variants in elite Japanese athletes: a caseâ€“control study,"The purpose of the present study was to identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms and rare variants that associate with elite Japanese athletic status. Subjects comprised 185 elite Japanese athletes who had represented Japan at international competitions (that is, 100 endurance/middle-power athletes: EMA; 85 sprint/power athletes: SPA) and 672 Japanese controls (CON). The entire mtDNA sequences (16â€‰569â€‰bp) were analyzed by direct sequencing. Nucleotide variants were detected at 1488 sites in the 857 entire mtDNA sequences. A total of 311 variants were polymorphisms (minor allele frequencyâ©¾1% in CON), and the frequencies of these polymorphisms were compared among the three groups. The EMA displayed excess of seven polymorphisms, including subhaplogroup D4e2- and D4g-specific polymorphisms, compared with CON (P<0.05), whereas SPA displayed excess of three polymorphisms and dearth of nine polymorphisms, including haplogroup G- and subhaplogroup G2a-specific polymorphisms, compared with CON (P<0.05). The frequencies of 10 polymorphisms, including haplogroup G- and subhaplogroup G2a-specific polymorphisms, were different between EMA and SPA (P<0.05): although none of these polymorphisms differed significantly between groups after correcting for multiple comparison (false discovery rate q-valueâ©¾0.05). The number of rare variants in the 12S ribosomal RNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit I genes were also higher in SPA than in CON (P<0.05). Analysis of the entire mtDNA of elite Japanese athletes revealed several haplogroup- and subhaplogroup-specific polymorphisms to be potentially associated with elite Japanese athletic status.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Eri Mikami"", ids = ""30335705""); list(name = ""Noriyuki Fuku"", ids = ""6503089""); list(name = ""Qing-Peng Kong"", ids = ""152571439""); list(name = ""Hideyuki Takahashi"", ids = ""144332841""); list(name = ""Nao Ohiwa"", ids = ""49729102""); list(name = ""Haruka Murakami"", ids = ""145788106""); list(name = ""Motohiko Miyachi"", ids = ""3243127""); list(name = ""Mitsuru Higuchi"", ids = ""1852603""); list(name = ""Masashi Tanaka"", ids = ""2065043""); list(name = ""Yannis P.

6a859c968152caced9498a82067ec223c682e4fe,PICS: probabilistic inference for ChIP-seq.,"ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel short-read sequencing. While it can profile genome-wide in vivo transcription factor-DNA association with higher sensitivity, specificity, and spatial resolution than ChIP-chip, it poses new challenges for statistical analysis that derive from the complexity of the biological systems characterized and from variability and biases in its sequence data. We propose a method called PICS (Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq) for identifying regions bound by transcription factors from aligned reads. PICS identifies binding event locations by modeling local concentrations of directional reads, and uses DNA fragment length prior information to discriminate closely adjacent binding events via a Bayesian hierarchicalâ€‚t-mixture model. It uses precalculated, whole-genome read mappability profiles and a truncatedâ€‚t-distribution to adjust binding event models for reads that are missing due to local genome repetitiveness. It estimates uncertainties in model parameters that can be used to define confidence regions on binding event locations and to filter estimates. Finally, PICS calculates a per-event enrichment score relative to a control sample, and can use a control sample to estimate a false discovery rate. Using published GABP and FOXA1 data from human cell lines, we show that PICS' predicted binding sites were more consistent with computationally predicted binding motifs than the alternative methods MACS, QuEST, CisGenome, and USeq.

1906a3750810f7e81a28a76b3496445adf748a18,"A powerful statistical framework for generalization testing in GWAS, with application to the HCHS/SOL.","In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), ""generalization"" is the replication of genotype-phenotype association in a population with different ancestry than the population in which it was first identified. Current practices for declaring generalizations rely on testing associations while controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) in the discovery study, then separately controlling error measures in the follow-up study. This approach does not guarantee control over the FWER or false discovery rate (FDR) of the generalization null hypotheses. It also fails to leverage the two-stage design to increase power for detecting generalized associations. We provide a formal statistical framework for quantifying the evidence of generalization that accounts for the (in)consistency between the directions of associations in the discovery and follow-up studies. We develop the directional generalization FWER (FWERg ) and FDR (FDRg ) controlling r-values, which are used to declare associations as generalized. This framework extends to generalization testing when applied to a published list of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-(SNP)-trait associations. Our methods control FWERg or FDRg under various SNP selection rules based on P-values in the discovery study. We find that it is often beneficial to use a more lenient P-value threshold than the genome-wide significance threshold. In a GWAS of total cholesterol in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), when testing all SNPs with P-values <5Ã—10-8 (15 genomic regions) for generalization in a large GWAS of whites, we generalized SNPs from 15 regions. But when testing all SNPs with P-values <6.6Ã—10-5 (89 regions), we generalized SNPs from 27 regions.",2017,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Tamar Sofer"", ids = ""3314248""); list(name = ""Ruth Heller"", ids = ""144622349""); list(name = ""M.

96b0926db6ec2c917be67959f984378f91ca60fe,Cortical thickness abnormalities in bipolar disorder patients with a lifetime history of auditory hallucinations,"OBJECTIVES
We aimed to investigate morphometric correlates of auditory hallucinations in bipolar disorder (BD) by comparing cortical thickness and cortical surface area in bipolar disorder patients with (BD+) and without (BD-) a lifetime history of auditory hallucinations. Based on previous findings in schizophrenia patients, we hypothesized that the cortex would be thinner in the auditory cortex in BD+ compared to BD-.


METHODS
Bipolar disorder spectrum (nÂ =Â 157) patients and healthy controls (nÂ =Â 279) underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Hypothesis-driven analyses of cortical thickness and surface area in regions of the auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus [HG], planum temporale and superior temporal gyrus) were conducted comparing BD+ (nÂ =Â 49) and BD- (nÂ =Â 108) using linear regression models, covaried for age and sex. Furthermore, we explored vertex-wise group differences in thickness and surface area across the whole cerebral cortex.


RESULTS
Hypothesis-driven analyses:BD+ had significantly thicker cortex in the left HG compared to BD- (BÂ =Â 0.128, PÂ =Â .0046). The finding was not explained by duration of illness, global functioning, bipolar subtype, IQ or use of antipsychotic, antidepressant or antiepileptic medication, or by lithium. Exploratory analyses: A small region of thicker cortex in BD+ compared to BD- was seen in the left superior parietal lobule (false discovery rate <0.05). There were no significant group differences in cortical surface area.


CONCLUSION

3265f41137e93e6f718725ce1c63ed116140eb24,Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling predicts relapse in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"Although the five-year survival of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) exceeds 80%, a group of patients presents poor prognosis due to early relapse (van den Berg et al, 2011). To date, treatment strategies have been defined by cytogenetically-based subtype categorization. However, ALL patients without chromosomal translocations associated with poor prognosis lack diagnostic markers that would allow specific therapies to be developed. DNA methylation alteration is a frequent event in cancer and is potentially very useful in the diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of drug response (Rodriguez-Paredes & Esteller, 2011). Hence, we attempted to characterize childhood B-ALLs without Philadelphia (BCR-ABL1) and MLL translocations on the basis of the DNA methylation profile of more than 450 000 CpG sites with the aim of providing a means to improve the accuracy of prognosis and treatment strategies. All the obtained DNA methylation data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database in the following link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=bfsbfcigsakcuty&acc={""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE39141"",""term_id"":""39141""}}GSE39141 
 
We derived genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 29 childhood B-ALL patients and four normal B-cell samples (NBC) using the Infinium 450 K DNA methylation Bead assay (450 K) (Deneberg et al, 2011). Twenty-five patient samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis (including 10 cytogenetically normal, eight hyperdiploid, five pseudodiploid and two unclassified samples) and four samples at disease relapse (Table 1). Profiling varying 11 112 CpG sites (SD>0Â·25) within all samples analysed clearly distinguished healthy B-cell specimens from B-ALL patient samples (Fig 1A).

Overall, B-ALL samples had a significantly greater variance in DNA methylation level than NBC samples (Wilcoxon test, P 0Â·05). However, the highest variance (SDâ‰¥0Â·25) was DNA hypermethylation found within the CGI context (Fig 1C, Fig S1), consistent with previous results obtained with lower coverage platforms (Milani et al, 2010). 
 
To obtain closer insight into the nature of variant sites, we determined differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) between healthy and cancer specimens (Table S1). We identified 3,414 dmCpGs, 88Â·2% (3,014) and 11Â·8% (400) of which respectively lost and gained DNA methylation in cancer samples (Fig 1D; Fig S2). Despite the predominantly hypomethylated dmCpGs, CGIs in gene promoters significantly gained DNA methylation at dmCpGs (Wilcoxon test; P < 0Â·01). Interestingly, the CGIs flanking CpG-poor regions (CpG island shores) were hypomethylated in ALL samples (Wilcoxon test; P < 0Â·01), consistent with previous studies identifying both regions as being highly variable in different cancer types, including leukaemia (Milani et al, 2010; Irizarry et al, 2009). 
 
Analysing variant CpG sites in an unsupervised manner, we identified two clearly distinct DNA methylome profiles in B-ALL patients (Fig 1A). While 14 samples (ALL-1) displayed highly aberrant methylation levels compared with the control, 15 samples (ALL-2) showed close similarities to healthy B-cells. Most strikingly, the five with disease-relapse-associated samples were all present in ALL-2 (5/15; X2 test, P < 0Â·01), presenting a signature with a significant association between DNA methylation and disease-free survival (log-rank Mantel-Cox test, P < 0Â·01; Fig 1E) and suggesting a possible application in future therapy strategies by taking into account epigenetically defined groups as previously suggested (Milani et al, 2010). 
 
Considering the presence of distinct DNA methylation subtypes in childhood B-ALLs and their potential application in clinical practice, we extracted a DNA methylation profile represented by 20 661 dmCpGs that distinguished the two groups (Table S2). In total, we detected 17 182 hypo- and 3 479 hypermethylated CpG sites in ALL-2 compared with ALL-1, respectively; differing in variance and associated with unique genomic features (Fig 1F-H). Confirming the signature in a 10-fold cross-validation model (area under the curve: 89Â·5), we concluded that the signature reliably detected both B-ALL subtypes and is thus an important tool for future disease diagnosis. 
 
In order to determine the affected biological and disease-associated pathways, we analysed the gene ontology (GO) of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites located in gene promoters. We noticed an enrichment (GO, level 5) of genes related to lymphocyte (including B-cell) differentiation in 672 gene promoters presenting higher methylation level in ALL-2 (false discovery rate [FDR]<0Â·05, Table S3). These genes include FOXP1, TCF3, BLNK, CD79A, RAG1 and RAG2, also associated with chromosomal translocations in ALLs and mutation in B-cell maturation-defective syndromes. We suggest that defects in the B-cell differentiation process display a unique property of samples present in ALL-2. 
 
The 2 608 genes associated with promoters showing less methylation in ALL-2 were highly enriched in developmental genes (FDR<0Â·05), including 97 HOX genes (Table S4). From the epigenetic point of view, developmental genes are associated with the Polycomb (Pc) complex and are marked by the histone modification H3K27me3. Interestingly, 43% (281 out of 654) of Polycomb target genes (PcTG) displayed lower methylation in ALL-2 gene promoters and were significantly enriched compared with promoters gaining methylation (X2 test, P < 0Â·01) (Lee et al, 2006). Accordingly, we found 24% (2181 out of 9052) of hypomethylated CpG sites associated with and significantly enriched in the Polycomb histone mark H3K27me3 (X2 test, P < 0Â·01, Fig S3) (Ernst et al, 2011). Taken together, the GO and PcTG analyses suggest that hypomethylation of genes involved in developmental processes are a unique feature of patient samples present in ALL-2. Hypermethylation of PcTG (Deneberg et al, 2011) has been previously identified as good prognostic markers in acute myeloid leukaemia patients, supporting the predictive potential of DNA methylation signatures in leukaemia. In addition, overexpression of HOX genes has been related to oncogenic transformation (Bach et al, 2010) and an increase in stem cell self-renewal (Ross et al, 2012) in leukaemia cells. 
 
Overall, genome-wide screening of DNA methylation in normal B-cells and primary B-ALL samples revealed distinct profiles, but most importantly defined two previously unknown B-ALL subtypes. Furthermore, we hypothesize that epigenetic changes mediate an undifferentiated stem cell-like phenotype of a newly identified B-ALL subtype that is possibly associated with drug resistance, resulting in disease relapse and presenting a signature of potential clinical use in the future.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juan Sandoval"", ids = ""145144840""); list(name = ""Holger Heyn"", ids = ""3473395""); list(name = ""JesÃºs MÃ©ndez-GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""1399602432""); list(name = ""Antonio GÃ³mez"", ids = ""79880528""); list(name = ""SebastiÃ¡n Moran"", ids = ""1860121""); list(name = ""M.

c849c83ad85967a999cee0900b6cfabd6eeb94cb,Non-syntenic genes drive RTCS-dependent regulation of the embryo transcriptome during formation of seminal root primordia in maize (Zea mays L.),"Seminal roots of maize are pivotal for early seedling establishment. The maize mutant rootless concerning crown and seminal roots (rtcs) is defective in seminal root initiation during embryogenesis. In this study, the transcriptomes of wild-type and rtcs embryos were analyzed by RNA-Seq based on histological results at three stages of seminal root primordia formation. Hierarchical clustering highlighted that samples of each genotype grouped together along development. Determination of their gene activity status revealed hundreds of genes specifically transcribed in wild-type or rtcs embryos, while K-mean clustering revealed changes in gene expression dynamics between wild-type and rtcs during embryo development. Pairwise comparisons of rtcs and wild-type embryo transcriptomes identified 131 transcription factors among 3526 differentially expressed genes [false discovery rate (FDR) <5% and |log2Fc|â‰¥1]. Among those, functional annotation highlighted genes involved in cell cycle control and phytohormone action, particularly auxin signaling. Moreover, in silico promoter analyses identified putative RTCS target genes associated with transcription factor action and hormone metabolism and signaling. Significantly, non-syntenic genes that emerged after the separation of maize and sorghum were over-represented among genes displaying RTCS-dependent expression during seminal root primordia formation. This might suggest that these non-syntenic genes came under the transcriptional control of the syntenic gene rtcs during seminal root evolution. Taken together, this study provides first insights into the molecular framework underlying seminal root initiation in maize and provides a starting point for further investigations of the molecular networks underlying RTCS-dependent seminal root initiation.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Huanhuan Tai"", ids = ""47299197""); list(name = ""Nina Opitz"", ids = ""34686353""); list(name = ""Andrew Lithio"", ids = ""6695533""); list(name = ""Xin Lu"", ids = ""145574672""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""48443856""); list(name = ""Frank Hochholdinger"", ids = ""3196694"")",6961956e20460f8cb115acaddea240432fbb8494; b5dcd0dcbdec405f8c12ab8544b20e87278ed76c; 1ec2e8b0dd118fc4e5aeacf43d6adc7a60791c73; c4a8ceb192879147652807f0948d29e8e09d7e34,b180c50ee294d2148e187148c472141d53fbd947; cc96ca17220419565967ad99491ec51b0a9cbfdb; 1e7d86ef78dfbe67acf927673cc67137f062a0ea; 82cd77c95cd8c51a9e8b9ced9ea8f82c5e50f7a5; cce28da4aef943762d9e65b1d6a7d4bdcbf012b5; 97c3ef77c609a489205a0a119d2ff5442294dc73; c039bd683400c014974bcc87bb8418ead27fbbf1; 47ed229c06c5a361df0f47c1c320bc5cf469ee8d; bffa946f6cc25a0456daa16cd5e833ac5ae16b10; 5de8d7ac0c28fdd96de17b17f4b8364fc01bf950; ce854b15699d283e1af4b3f3a86a4b6c3028a45d; 3770689295d8304b7377ef0a5b1526e9f0aa6cb1; 50f4bedfb39760b11d786fa7bbab9dd256c34567; 0931cc1bb64fdee8268f33c08008b5c42dd0de48; 04ba9ee4ba1d8089113df9b1961bf7d98b209685; 3544104c968a6b2995aa302623d785508ba76204; 3385db9c208ef02e0a4743d8c9bff020295fb0c8; 88a52b0d4d7c3c7f35eb723662e02aa28a25707e; e2c4b1b3a01d859a40b65354e42deb8f7a93d977; 6c1c77a6b970278bded27acc507b4e20067bffd4; acc30b6d267c2089c0e803f580b6ef2ec1f9a3e4; 8a679f3843241ca11854cdf15ccba0f1e92c5624; 4f03a8aa7a0668cdcc865feb5f4fb68c5d07e8d2; 9adbe167f92f6c925a38eb0f88b74a70b681c3f3; 46f8339ddb7f74bb63016e3e0b7917cad0584dc4; b457466e42892c5201b46e905ee998abc1c4e2c6; 99e175df3de9f8df7b6664ab17870db362822355; 016505b55eab9dc3042e501722bb2eefdfa24ead; 7f00037da2808388fa6bb18d04fdf27874b6abca; 7e1c14f4f85522cca4698f4f8b3b9af669caec0a; 7a26cc4495762b71baf3c61cc295e891e0b05dec; 5ff42150c156e82cd7a472b34c4c9b669b3c4699; f39de54be531dd5623ba025da1bd2fbb94fee08e; a857acafb4d10eff3fa11defe10550bddcb7b880; defb77194bedfc4c2ec5dd8a636019cb2e275365; 32e48251d870f4c8cb9ae33fee9c8804f2a27b7f; 700ffe96d4f824b9f61edc478f3384c119e9e958; c6596b137c22b9ffac944ccae778ad72241f6db5; 2750270b517b97e23acd0ec236f9750edf6bdc2c; f9468e496734d82bbf400404fb72c28c91512ebb; b8914e1519991aee4969a6e5599db4a80074bb4b; f757d4d9e002fabb264d644585294b1c697b2a44; 5fb5cf36735f1f7724f84153170c4b670a69d179; 7b3ecb217afb3342350b030a70d6cc60919ca7a6; 79639f0c18f14c2a40a8634f078e723c8a1a36e1; ae35a70924e066d4c151400284501131946976f2; cb22aba571bba0e74c1493131a7a63bca8460a3f; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; ac34cb0bce783c62b1d7fad76611b3185d70779b; 7d537e38c6a0d16752b4d1efbfad5999e57595cd; a485dd5ea67699c5871dd87239e19f70d456c762; b3b0b28a32f81d36c642cff26faace4397a8d58d; 866d50b6c3d01d83cb4d3d48fe5ea71a3049b8aa; af848111ade734f51a6cd75e203162167849a8ef; d97caa01343eaa8b9e5f1ee7b268ca1bd42a2b4b; c03673380ec06cd230c290b05ed135657d4bcd99; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 65bb01b985035307f7b1102e17b8a5c0f2dafff8; 303b983a0af0b5b226f6263a03b506f4272ef769,Journal of Experimental Botany,68,403 - 414
bd35bad17723e9c0bb81235d179be2c993b044a0,MeRIP-PF: An Easy-to-use Pipeline for High-resolution Peak-finding in MeRIP-Seq Data,"RNA modifications, especially methylation of the N(6) position of adenosine (A)-m(6)A, represent an emerging research frontier in RNA biology. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology, in-depth study of m(6)A distribution and function relevance becomes feasible. However, a robust method to effectively identify m(6)A-modified regions has not been available yet. Here, we present a novel high-efficiency and user-friendly analysis pipeline called MeRIP-PF for the signal identification of MeRIP-Seq data in reference to controls. MeRIP-PF provides a statistical P-value for each identified m(6)A region based on the difference of read distribution when compared to the controls and also calculates false discovery rate (FDR) as a cut off to differentiate reliable m(6)A regions from the background. Furthermore, MeRIP-PF also achieves gene annotation of m(6)A signals or peaks and produce outputs in both XLS and graphical format, which are useful for further study.

318f2fd4fae0944beece6769f49d8b11684105d6,IONM evidence: Putting the work and insight of TÃ©llez et al. in context,"True positive (TP): Intraoperative testing meets alarm criteria through the end of surgery and the patient awakens with a new deficit relevant to the monitored neural system. True negative (TN): Intraoperative testing remains unchanged through the end of surgery and the patient awakens with no new deficit relevant to the monitored neural system. False negative (FN): Intraoperative testing remains unchanged through the end of surgery but the patient awakens with a new deficit relevant to the monitored neural system. False positive (FP): Intraoperative testing meets alarm criteria through the end of surgery but the patient awakens with no new deficit relevant to the monitored neural system. Reversible signal change: Intraoperative testing meets alarm criteria during surgery but reverses to an unchanged/baseline result (most often after an intervention). Intraoperative testing is unchanged/baseline) at the end of surgery. Note: This is a particular problem of IONM when the reference standard (clinical condition of the patient) cannot be assessed in real time. AB Hillâ€™s cause/ effect criteria can be used to evaluate and score reversible signal change results (Skinner and Holdefer, 2014). Positive predictive value (PPV): The fraction of all positive results that are true is given by (TP/TP + FP). False positive discovery rate: The fraction of all positive results that are false is given by (FP/TP + FP). Harner reported better anatomical preservation of the seventh nerve in a monitored cohort versus a matched historical cohort of unmonitored large vestibular schwannoma resections. Among medium/large sized tumors, differences favoring the monitored group were seen at 3 months but not in the initial post-operative epoch (Harner et al., 1987). For three decades, cranial nerve intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has been predicated on EMG and in situ cranial nerve stimulation (CrN S). On anatomical and physiological grounds, there is reason to believe intraoperative transcranial electrical stimulation to effect a facial or other cranial nerve motor evoked potential (CrN MEP) should yield truer IONM results than CrN S. As with CrN S, the final/baseline peak amplitude ratio is the commonly reported metric (Dong et al., 2005; Akagami et al., 2005; Fukuda et al., 2008). Acioly introduced other intraoperative data points (tumor dissection/baseline amplitude, for example) and extended reports of follow up (3â€“26 months) in an attempt to flesh out the predictive power of CrN MEPs (Acioly et al., 2011). The theoretical ability of CrN MEP to assess corticobulbar, nuclear, and nerve conduction favorably contrasts to the frequent inability to stimulate the 7th nerve proximally in large vestibular schwannoma procedures (Dong et al., 2005). Among the limitations of CrN MEP is its predictive rather than preventative use. This was pointed out by Dong and colleagues early on. No reversible signal change was identified by them (Dong et al., 2005). Akagami et al. do allude to the benefit of â€˜â€˜a temporary decrease in MEPs [which] can often alert the neurosurgeon to be careful and redirect work towards a different part of the tumor, and return to the original area of dissection once the MEP recovers.â€ However, this potentially preventative aspect of CrN MEP recording was not reported by these investigators or the Acioly group (Akagami et al., 2005; Acioly et al., 2011). Setting the alert criterion sensitive enough to avert FN reporting also limits CrN MEP. The commonly accepted >50% amplitude reduction alarm may contribute to FP prediction. The Dong group reported eighteen positive CrN MEPs (11 true, 7 false) at the 50% cut-off amplitude: a false discovery rate of 39% (FP/TP + FP = 1 PPV). Using similar scoring, the Akagami groupâ€™s false discovery rate is 42% (7 true, 5 false positive). This measure may be more meaningful to surgeons than the often reported FP rate (FP/FP + TN). The surgeon wants to know: what is the rate of true vs false reports after an alarm. Because many patients with new post-operative deficits tend to improve in later follow-up (Acioly et al., 2011), the immediate post-operative data may underestimate the ultimate FP discovery rate. The study by TÃ©llez and colleagues in this issue of Clinical Neurophysiology raises a fresh concern regarding the accuracy of CrN MEPs (TÃ©llez et al., 2016). Because peripheral subthreshold axonal stimulation generates a variable period of superexcitability, the extracranial leak of subthreshold pulse trains may generate a pseudo-CrN MEP and false negative reporting (Burke et al., 2001; Bostock, 2005). The already known exigencies of CrN MEP recording prevent all but the most experienced practitioners from attempting this modality. This preliminary report strongly suggests further inquiry into underlying CrN MEP physiology. The authorsâ€™ data is preliminary, but our hunch is that they have identified a critical flaw in the test. Fortunately, few FN CrN MEP cases are currently reported. That fact suggests that an imperfect understanding of CrN MEP physiology is not generally reflected in studies so far. Nevertheless, given this elegant testâ€™s challenges, broader questions of diagnostic test accuracy and effectiveness should be asked.

5fcbf64e2cdb52dffbd4641e762f86798cbf177b,Statistical Inference for Matrix-variate Gaussian Graphical Models and False Discovery Rate Control,"Matrix-variate Gaussian graphical models (GGM) have been widely used for modelling matrix-variate data. Since the supports of sparse row and column precision matrices encode the conditional independence among rows and columns of the data, it is of great interest to conduct support recovery. A commonly used approach is the penalized log-likelihood method. However, due to the complicated structure of the precision matrices of matrix-variate GGMs, the log-likelihood is non-convex, which brings a great challenge for both computation and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach by formulating the support recovery problem into a multiple testing problem. A new test statistic is proposed and based on that, we further develop a method to control false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically. Our method is computationally attractive since it only involves convex optimization. Theoretically, our method allows very weak conditions, i.e., even when the sample size is a constant and the dimensions go to infinity, the asymptotic normality of the test statistics and FDR control can still be guaranteed. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is illustrated by both simulated and real data analysis.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiao Dong Chen"", ids = ""1683647""); list(name = ""Weidong Liu"", ids = ""40474857"")",28ba70019c019e32a0abbab0c6c39fc64335db36; ad2a6a2b94184a6dad3d8c4eef99aa3eb1b313c3; 23fb0f63d8167e1f1e8d2bd5c025b723eec4a2e4,,arXiv: Methodology,,

Storey et al. (2004) further proved that a related procedure strongly controls FDR through the elegant use of empirical processes. Since then, many FDR control procedures have been developed. In light of these new developments, we continue Storeyâ€™s work on the conservative point estimation of FDR. We first give a corrected version of the finite sample proof for conservative point estimation of FDR. Then we survey existing theoretically proven FDR control procedures and show that some of these procedures can be cast as plug-in procedures with their estimators of the proportion of true null hypotheses (Ï€0) more conservative",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kun Liang"", ids = ""144167986"")",,1f701007f789890d1066172094bbf158f002f673; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 269a8428ea9d00a57792fe544ec2d784c476f3c0; 9e130b2c4bc2e1256f558f25dcb9c2fe53b6e08f; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 1c7ffc9b8da5873f06a3edc4448f80a01f174aeb; e0d17100220e508db7d8d3eb1725a83fad2c70c8; 2e16298ac9dc92ce87fcb018e202c65aa141e504; abd6cc122265b2d5de049145a0d91211bace5009; 440d60685950e80616b1c968b73dc2728bed9833; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 0514c2895a30b47b7c0449ddc87c5f6b7e4f1556; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; a89579758b9ed13d3ba62c3b501dd727b179db44; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 977ad35811e4d4014143ace7f99c9422ff52eacc; d7203a27edddacbc573a29754bc192f7bedecaca; c3e597dd95e89ed786605b10b888a017326f19a1; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 81eb0080b5635f117b8b022b6e544987f651209a; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 92d56545ae4f43aff2a2b81402f5dca032d394d4; 9616f36d11b0e83159716b5dfdd14cfc060a8ebc; aed0004e4d52d48ff39681fd0bb6b5483608b00a; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 77ee39af1b9e4f518c4722bcc62825b27f7b53e8; e2f393d815d826b22ae36c7b606caf875ffecc9e; 556af22166bb4ad5b9be8e225b74726e9bc757ac; 7f23fd4ae73aa61e154ba91da43a37b1a26a2cae; cdf832ab4fa74d503565396219758961775ca023; f7b886a3ccd077179c01c074f1351d9b9695fc3c; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; d0f3bbe7b5654427246bee62650f8f89ec3ba26c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 59eb429a8a3a545efdb8f1f8382c43d02c683851; 3092a4929bdb3d6a8fe53f162586b7431b5ff8a4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 27a0fdc61cfe32fec322535bd131c610bc450caf; c5ea43ed57dc0021f7da4486814163f2f1661d29; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a; 2048aa8f10d832d4ed1608f9188cf47d2ec5e71a; 48f9692a1d300b566d900e5579396c44e87c8fa5; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; f6a13f116e270dde9d67848495f801cdb8efa25d; 8ba52941f62683530cc8651d2f2b460ff4de9ee7,,,
4d819554a12cede6eea903039cef227fb9dc210f,MicroRNA Array Normalization: An Evaluation Using a Randomized Dataset as the Benchmark,"MicroRNA arrays possess a number of unique data features that challenge the assumption key to many normalization methods. We assessed the performance of existing normalization methods using two microRNA array datasets derived from the same set of tumor samples: one dataset was generated using a blocked randomization design when assigning arrays to samples and hence was free of confounding array effects; the second dataset was generated without blocking or randomization and exhibited array effects. The randomized dataset was assessed for differential expression between two tumor groups and treated as the benchmark. The non-randomized dataset was assessed for differential expression after normalization and compared against the benchmark. Normalization improved the true positive rate significantly in the non-randomized data but still possessed a false discovery rate as high as 50%. Adding a batch adjustment step before normalization further reduced the number of false positive markers while maintaining a similar number of true positive markers, which resulted in a false discovery rate of 32% to 48%, depending on the specific normalization method. We concluded the paper with some insights on possible causes of false discoveries to shed light on how to improve normalization for microRNA arrays.",2014,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Li-Xuan Qin"", ids = ""50680094""); list(name = ""Qin Zhou"", ids = ""50656906"")",80ec2f2c560f5768530ee4558d1dfec813541fc9; 5ac6f1ae8ca078faf37d33947910b2d763fd3d00; 2b3a7a8a37669785643fc67b8030d3f4a38d0f01; b2d09362f3ecc4ea1541d979188188ea8431cff9; 8585cdf699ab4eb4ef042e278d213fc5806726a3; c680dd9ea764d4cd399c11a7f695ce9c8ef1ad4e; 6e3ecccc4a0c20f1625439f5e558145171f3ebbd; cd465ca5e65922588b164bd8887217337e29fc7f; f782e3d8d232d2bcba383e80c618772e4feeef3b,6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; c7497d6d32d3dd6f893609a17848c807134e1cc4; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; f18fa8991261d8fcf670b59b150a555fd4b24fe2; 77ef9aac7e0199184cb3169ac5e4de1d5fd7152b; 2b43b68039ccede47757b29a897169f2e0c2ebf0; c1d5adbe76bb3b72c71ed930272dec2a3a917f76; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; a3758c4f4ccfe699b8abd70f59553acca21e0e32; f6f195a08617dcb4bb6a13a62c9352c69a4d9e4d; c3965d029b5d0f3219bb98275d992a78ecdafee1; ed9221854cf20af8816204162fe40bb9121bb8c3; 94c518caaa826159110f1d9fe7d79b88860f4a1e; 1f1b750baf5b0fa427c5b38379cdcc8d70634d36; cf4ac8c588c71fd30892a6b5125dfc13a263dfb9; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; 0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; 9e7300b92f6da054e6006f4f7160f9e0573d1fe5; aa21536103308d8c46c4ab67473f2448bc8bd1f6; 5dd438c7998ac943babf0a7293c96db2550bbbf0; d1c75829aac81a1f735a128bd5957a065558f5e1; d52ed80d751b352ac5c0811806e18ed7af914ae2; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; ad395ed399ad283d37a37d8f31fa4234e04856da,PLoS ONE,9,

In this study we extend the investigation to the case of multiple comparisons involving correlated non-central t-statistics, in particular when several treatments or time periods are being compared to a control in a repeated-measures design with many dependent outcome measures. In addition, we consider several dependence structures other than serial correlation and illustrate how the FDR depends on the interaction between effect size and the type of correlation structure as indexed by Foerstner s distance metric from an identity. The relationship between the correlation matrix R of the original dependent variables and R~, the correlation matrix of associated t-statistics is also studied. In general R~ depends not only on R, but also on sample size and the signed effect sizes for the multiple comparisons.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alan H.

52dbd8a6b91ca2061107f5e039f8bf6a2c34cdb6,Approaches to disease progression modelling for identifying predictors of future cognitive decline in dementia,"Dementia progression is characterised by a lengthy pre-symptomatic phase, where pathology may be accumulating, followed by a more rapid decline evidenced by onset of clinical symptoms and eventually functional impairment. The rate of decline in symptoms from cognitive impairment to dementia greatly varies between individuals, complicating prognosis and the assessment of much needed disease-modifying drugs. As a result there is a huge demand for greater understanding of the between-subject variability in progression and a need to understand biomarkers and risk factors for predicting future cognitive decline. In cohorts derived from two of the largest NHS foundation trust mental health service providers in the UK and multiple Alzheimerâ€™s cohorts, this thesis explores methods for modelling disease progression and investigates the relationship between blood based proteins, genetic variants, health indicators and potential repurposing medications with cognitive decline. Through applying approaches that tackle three areas that require consideration for modelling of cognitive decline and disease progression, this thesis identified associations of antidepressant medication and psychotic symptoms associated with faster cognitive decline in dementia, in two separate cohorts.

In particular, knowledge of the specific genes and pathways driving tumor growth in these patients would allow for treatment with therapeutics directed against these molecular targets. To this end, we reasoned that through the integrated analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and gene expression profiling we could understand the molecular mechanisms associated with an aggressive imaging phenotype and thus gain insight into potential therapeutic targets for these patients. Materials and Methods: We studied 61 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, for whom DCE-MRI scans and core biopsies were available prior to the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To analyse the DCE-MRI data, we used Tofts9 pharmacokinetic (PK) model to quantify the rate constant kep that governs the washout of contrast agent from the tumor extravascular extracellular space. We chose to focus on the PK parameter kep since our analysis showed that it can be estimated reliably from the low temporal resolution diagnostic DCE-MRI scans that are routinely performed in the clinic. We extracted mRNA from formalin fixed paraffin embedded core biopsy samples and measured gene expression using Affymetrix U133 whole genome arrays. Following normalization and pre-processing, we used significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) to determine which genes were statistically significantly correlated with median kep. Results: Using a local false discovery rate of 5% resulted in a total of 328 genes that were significantly positively correlated with median kep. These included copper transporter like solute carrier family31member2 (SLC31A2), cancer stem cell (CSC) related genes such as CD44, aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A3 (ALDH1A3), and integrin alpha-6 (ITGA6), hypoxia regulated genes such as hypoxia inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), kinases such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor2-alpha kinases (EIF2AK2, EIF2AK1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK1, PDK3). Discussion: Our results illustrate how functional imaging modalities such as DCE-MRI can be combined with gene expression profiling to provide insight into molecular targets that may have important therapeutic implications in breast cancer. We found that locally advanced breast cancers with high vascular permeability and/or blood flow, as quantified by the washout parameter median kep, were associated with an up-regulation of genes related to CSCs and copper metabolism, the latter of which is known to play a role in angiogenesis. In addition, up-regulation of hypoxia related genes such as HIF1a, EIF2AK1&2 and PDK1&3 may promote tumor survival and spread under stress. Our results suggest that locally advanced breast cancers with high vascular permeability and/or blood flow may benefit from therapies directed at one or more of these molecular targets. Furthermore, functional imaging with DCE-MRI may be helpful as a noninvasive means of selecting and monitoring therapy against these targets.

Whether primary human cell cultures can be used as a stable research model has yet to be determined. The characteristics of three cultured craniopharyngioma primary cell (CPC) lines were identified using immunofluorescence. The culture duration for each CPC line was 10, 20 and 30 days. Cell lines and paired parental tumor tissues were subsequently analyzed using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Transcriptomic differences between ACP tissues and CPC lines were compared. CPCs maintained the original epithelial lineage markers, including pan-cytokeratin and epithelial cell adhesion molecule. However, the Pearson's correlation coefficient of transcriptomes between each pair of CPC lines and ACP tissues decreased from 0.657 (cultured for 10 days) to 0.61 (cultured for 20 days) and further to 0.547 (cultured for 30 days). The number of differentially expressed genes between ACP tissues and CPCs was increased from 1,247 (cultured for 10 days) to 1,643 (cultured for 20 days) and then to 1,949 (cultured for 30 days). The results of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated that the diversity of gene sets increased with longer culture time. Significant differences in the majority of signature gene sets were not observed between ACP tissues and CPCs, with the exception of keratinization phenotype [normalized enrichment score (NES)=-2.02, false discovery rate (FDR)=0.0038] and epithelial cell phenotype (NES=-1.82, FDR=0.032). Cell proliferation (NES=1.78, FDR=0.028) and mitosis (NES=1.93, FDR=0.012) were enhanced in CPCs. Therefore, primary human cell cultures can be used as a suitable research platform for ACP, however further experiments are required.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peidong Zhang"", ids = ""50264618""); list(name = ""Chao-hu Wang"", ids = ""8714800""); list(name = ""Jun Fan"", ids = ""1410021922""); list(name = ""Jun-xiang Peng"", ids = ""4894144""); list(name = ""Jun Pan"", ids = ""49106785""); list(name = ""Songtao Qi"", ids = ""145153421""); list(name = ""Yi Liu"", ids = ""47910069"")",,251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; 4d13d2f17299d68f0b9b9e01bfcff81789e77a4d; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; e860a7bcfa2e932a80bb4e174b0ff4eb0fd715e5; 34e99aaae934f7e659c89cdff8ec89cb63a32448; 84bc2d037342f3904a2fc4c0bf25f09905f5d72c; 96bea6522607ab6891bde544d679a444bb2b8f0b; 2e3640bed32a9d1ad8e6e746ec67d36969868104; 3a05c09de4d9a83363c07f0d86ad207cc27188dc; ef4814a56004762e493730f8893d29d3f71eee94; 75a85f2b59be38f5577a0603da63b81ca4c8c7b0; aac4c06123b307c8225adb4065f2097bc54cfae7; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; d848aca2da916cc3adc7cdcba8f0b8cbf360cb47; bd8c2a00ff56ae8d3794f6cc268035c05fa5fe0a; b9f5b7907c6ed2f6b0b3e0d64a524a1378df5e26; 8aa202bfe067f8be243b8b95d5d356327eef71e6; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 748ebe49860fb93f20eeb8b4583cc08053dc0b94; 176490c7bbb20b5a64aca49d9dc3b75bdfd76d67; d2fabce7e313869f39d4c6fff8bab6e463c21e9f; 5734f09701a6c75584c68afa02bf50aa046f09a8; c52f6ece04c0cca6960d690a9f03b32ca0cfdff4; a3e0b133fee7fc69e1e8308ca6695e52580adc90; b2dd5050f47a473ccc38dd32a6bfc6389f4575f7; 94727da03edc11fca584137cabeadf2f0f575cfa; d81719b712efae05a4fb1ccd5186c7a346428541; 8c955ea6d8b19bee9b5360c956a7a5ed947114fe; 9323fc0f0e85a53d647518dfce46fff300bb2cca; e103616347767067000420b78bf0d1adeb770f3b; 41badfbe03d7835c3fb0b7148c14cc869e2c4430; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; 6d1fcde043a8ee9c4f795d3c0dbb8316a03cd666; 4512e21bada0130bf4a48e884e8156ef823242cf; 5ea180ec9eaba7722cef434a2391fe73b7d342ea; 1239af4f10d60c08a2233344b3234b3e4c49f354,Oncology Letters,19,2346 - 2354

We evaluated the feasibility of using in-solution hybridization-based target capture on pooled DNA samples to enable cost-efficient population sequencing studies. For this, we performed pooled sequencing of 100 HapMap samples across âˆ¼ 600 kb of DNA sequence using the Illumina GAIIx. Using our accurate variant calling method for pooled sequence data, we were able to not only identify single nucleotide variants with a low false discovery rate (<1%) but also accurately detect short insertion/deletion variants. In addition, with sufficient coverage per individual in each pool (30-fold) we detected 97.2% of the total variants and 93.6% of variants below 5% in frequency. Finally, allele frequencies for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) estimated from the pooled data and the HapMap genotype data were tightly correlated (correlation coefficient >â€Š =â€Š 0.995).",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vikas Bansal"", ids = ""35448818""); list(name = ""Ryan Tewhey"", ids = ""1814786""); list(name = ""Emily M.

36323abe13c34d07b09bc47cd08d5f30e9ea943e,P4-16-02: Problems with Identifying Bone Metastasis-Specific Genes without Considering Biological Differences between ER-Positive and ER-Negative Breast Cancers.,"Background: Bone metastasis-specific genes in breast cancer have been reported without considering the significant differences in ER status between bone and non-bone metastases. The aims of this study were to validate genes that had been reported as bone metastasis-specific genes using our data set and to identify bone metastasis-specific genes on the basis of biological differences between ERpositive and ER-negative breast cancers. Patients and Methods: We used Affymetrix GeneChip arrays to analyze tumor samples obtained from 365 primary invasive breast cancer patients who underwent surgery from 1999 to 2008. We excluded patients with HER2âˆ’positive breast cancer (normalized HER2 mRNA expression [probe set 216836_s_at] > 12.54). We classified the samples into 3 cohorts according to first metastatic site: bone, non-bone, or no metastasis. Differential expression of genes between bone and non-bone cohorts that were differentially expressed was identified using the Cox proportional hazards model, and gene sets was assessed using gene-set analysis. Results: Of the 365 patients, 34 (9.3%) were included in the bone cohort and 32 (8.8%) in the non-bone cohort. Two hundred fourteen (58.6%) had ER-positive and 151 (41.4%) had ER-negative breast cancer. First, we performed gene-set analysis using 5 gene sets that had been reported to be associated with bone metastasis. One gene set, which had been detected using an ER-negative breast cancer cell line, was validated as predicting bone metastasis in ER-positive breast cancer. None of the 5 gene sets predicted bone metastasis in ER-negative breast cancer. We then determined the levels of individual genes associated with bone metastasis by ER status using all 16,712 probe sets filtered by average gene expression level. When we analyzed all patients without any stratification by ER status, as in previous studies, 592 probe sets were significantly overexpressed in the bone cohort compared with the non-bone cohort, with a false discovery rate of â‰¤0.05. However, when we analyzed ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers separately, no genes were found with significant differences between bone and non-bone cohorts. Finally, we used 2,246 functionally annotated gene sets assembled from Gene Ontology to examine possible biological differences between bone and non-bone cohorts. In the bone cohort, 151 and 125 gene sets were significantly overexpressed in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers, respectively ( P â‰¤ 0.05). Ppathways related to Cellular growth and proliferation, and intracellular and second-messenger signaling were overexpressed in ER-positive breast cancer, whereas pathways related to nuclear receptor and cytokine signaling were overexpressed in ER-negative breast cancer. Most bone-metastasis-related pathways were different in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers (91.4% and 89.6% of the gene sets, respectively). Discussion: No genes were found that can predict bone metastasis. ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers have different biological potentials for bone metastasis. Therefore, we need to assess the prediction model of bone metastasis based on the biological features for each ER status separately.

1158884fd48fcf61da8e4f4ade2fcd0bbff2df0e,Fresh frozen plasma-to-red blood cell ratio is an independent predictor of blood loss in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion.,"PURPOSE
In major trauma with massive blood loss, higher fresh frozen plasma (FFP)-to-red blood cell (RBC) ratios have been associated with improved morbidity and mortality. Our population of patients with neuromuscular scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) often lose volumes of blood considered massive, i.e., half a blood volume in three hours. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of FFP ratio with blood loss in this elective surgical population.


METHODS
Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis undergoing PSF with unit rod fixation were identified from our anesthesia cases database. The patients were divided into two groups: the low FFP group received FFP-to-RBC â‰¤ 0.5, and the high FFP group received FFP-to-RBC > 0.5. After controlling for a false discovery rate in the univariate analysis, a logistic and linear regression was performed to understand the contribution of the significant factors associated with increased blood loss.


RESULTS
Risk estimation showed that patients in the low FFP group were more likely to lose > 120% blood volume (odds ratio, 3.87; 95% confidence interval, 2.03-7.38). Linear regression revealed that each unit of increase in FFP-to-RBC ratio was associated with a 27.5% (95% confidence interval, -43.12-11.89) mean reduction in blood volume loss.


CONCLUSIONS
In our retrospective study, we found that FFP-to-RBC ratio was significant independent predictor of blood loss in this group of complex spine patients undergoing PSF. Thus, in patients with neuromuscular scoliosis undergoing posterior spine fusion, use of higher ratio of FFP to RBC may decrease blood loss.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kesavan Sadacharam"", ids = ""50315178""); list(name = ""B.

8f9f9a0a0d046b9584d8e3fabf27f61f3ad104da,Cortical thickness and surface area in neonates at high risk for schizophrenia,"AbstractSchizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder 
associated with subtle abnormal cortical thickness and cortical surface area. However, it is unclear whether these abnormalities exist in neonates associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia. To this end, this preliminary study was conducted to identify possible abnormalities of cortical thickness and surface area in the high-genetic-risk neonates. Structural magnetic resonance images were acquired from offspring of mothers (NÂ =Â 21) who had schizophrenia (NÂ =Â 12) or schizoaffective disorder (NÂ =Â 9), and also matched healthy neonates of mothers who were free of psychiatric illness (NÂ =Â 26). Neonatal cortical surfaces were reconstructed and parcellated as regions of interest (ROIs), and cortical thickness for each vertex was computed as the shortest distance between the inner and outer surfaces. Comparisons were made for the average cortical thickness and total surface area in each of 68 cortical ROIs. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, it was found that the female high-genetic-risk neonates had significantly thinner cortical thickness in the right lateral occipital cortex than the female control neonates. Before FDR correction, the high-genetic-risk neonates had significantly thinner cortex in the left transverse temporal gyrus, left banks of superior temporal sulcus, left lingual gyrus, right paracentral cortex, right posterior cingulate cortex, right temporal pole, and right lateral occipital cortex, compared with the control neonates. Before FDR correction, in comparison with control neonates, male high-risk neonates had significantly thicker cortex in the left frontal pole, left cuneus cortex, and left lateral occipital cortex; while female high-risk neonates had significantly thinner cortex in the bilateral paracentral, bilateral lateral occipital, left transverse temporal, left pars opercularis, right cuneus, and right posterior cingulate cortices. The high-risk neonates also had significantly smaller cortical surface area in the right pars triangularis (before FDR correction), compared with control neonates.

30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98,Largeâ€scale multiple testing under dependence,"The paper considers the problem of multiple testing under dependence in a compound decision theoretic framework. The observed data are assumed to be generated from an underlying two-state hidden Markov model. We propose oracle and asymptotically optimal data-driven procedures that aim to minimize the false non-discovery rate FNR subject to a constraint on the false discovery rate FDR. It is shown that the performance of a multiple-testing procedure can be substantially improved by adaptively exploiting the dependence structure among hypotheses, and hence conventional FDR procedures that ignore this structural information are inefficient. Both theoretical properties and numerical performances of the procedures proposed are investigated. It is shown that the procedures proposed control FDR at the desired level, enjoy certain optimality properties and are especially powerful in identifying clustered non-null cases. The new procedure is applied to an influenza-like illness surveillance study for detecting the timing of epidemic periods.

71b792d089a1cd18a4343a58a204843575ba6acc,Identification of a Potential Regulatory Variant for Colorectal Cancer Risk Mapping to 3p21.31 in Chinese Population,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have established chromosome 3p21.31 as a susceptibility locus for colorectal cancer (CRC) that lacks replication and exploration in the Chinese population. We searched potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block of 3p21.31 with chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of histone modification, and tested their association with CRC via a case-control study involving 767 cases and 1397 controls in stage 1 and 528 cases and 678 controls in stage 2. In addition to the tag SNP rs8180040 (odds ratio (OR)â€‰=â€‰0.875, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)â€‰=â€‰0.793-0.966, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008, P-FDR (false discovery rate)â€‰=â€‰0.040), rs1076394 presented consistently significant associations with CRC risk at both stages with ORâ€‰=â€‰0.850 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.771-0.938, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, P-FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.005) under the additive model in combined analyses. Supported by the analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), it was suggested that rs1076394 served as an expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) for gene CCDC12 and NME6, while NME6's expression was obviously higher in CRC tissues. Using biofeature information such as ChIP-seq and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data might help researchers to interpret GWAS results and locate functional variants for diseases in the post-GWAS era.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juntao Ke"", ids = ""8540505""); list(name = ""Jiao Lou"", ids = ""5245289""); list(name = ""Rong Zhong"", ids = ""144390571""); list(name = ""Xueqin Chen"", ids = ""2430869""); list(name = ""Jiaoyuan Li"", ids = ""6343925""); list(name = ""Cheng Liu"", ids = ""50557028""); list(name = ""Yajie Gong"", ids = ""5602620""); list(name = ""Yang Yang"", ids = ""49308027""); list(name = ""Ying Zhu"", ids = ""46758621""); list(name = ""Yi Zhang"", ids = ""46867668""); list(name = ""Jiang Chang"", ids = ""145021435""); list(name = ""Jing Gong"", ids = ""145116759"")",,a2e5cb4898ff903d425f096ecf9a82074a855c9b; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 919c9ca2df30bbac5c92338d75c8aa5692d6a1ca; 11d588113d38cdce51c70066dfe9f088cfb349ea; 0673fe9752d31043ecb09a105ecb8a088c131222; 4c666a4d6644530aebd7631d077a83fb4e470da1; 2e7a48c201222712d703d18412f34de5d41db2a0; 674bb669fe7303695b5c91821d7be13df30b59f1; 4dc2928f0af6b81a4ab079256d073d5da696f6e8; 949fbcbdd73778334e242e3c77b7166e906e5edf; 433f148274ab2d0ea5759ba814ad02952c47bbf1; 4b1e0fc855e83d9b9760af96ac232199d5b4fc07; 67684870a0bdd62b2f55f20e7fe05648a4501808; 4e74a027530f5cf993e7a73736e1c873c085e523; 4adc355cf67c5e8b673ec645d2ebea9ebb092bf3; ada9bc02772ff75f4c31f8d3e9bba9b5fd8ec4c2; 2a1866c104377ea320416330c6030521f246bb6d; 917268ce9560c5cf8f1a49f0890668bb2de0346f; ccc188887a7b04e676dbe35563874475cacfc691; da39fd810ce25bcff77b105a14fc845fcd5b29ec; 982c7e0949733af4774449dd9c4c93f190f1c5d6; d3680aaa222a12be6962d616f0697df5b7b3d5fc; 7db8e881c5fa376a1387ce6b4cf829a55217c26e; ab0729f1cb0c920972c4762f911d04fb8c3f8e36; 9478d90e91b26b7fa31de651b2a17deabfb876c8; e958000d346aa67b95055d151c04831a32bb5290; d383a7534383372b7af8581938cb6ce818009292; f571dfd08fdf8daedc305ca9aa47dfc8318794a5; c14bcf138bb06caeb72c1698f7ff64680e030406; 4342da92e8797b6bc38b2a5b1a5c341cd5f0d178; 4814d539308b1d34a2f5dbc408e24e7043d4800b; 4b872a0a333c5e3f8f2534b321d44394dae92105; 98b9d91aedf9f4075773cf94b58ccede16908bc6; 28098fb5155a3886f8085ab797a86467003ac9d0; 61b13b1324e1f7bdf5832b0402f6e86f5495f5f8; 827fb71090334bf0278020cb0928de7519c878cf; e69ea79cb824acfe3afc3bf9a0f7d98b4956b647; 525e9b13430dbe83425750df3a60afbc491918aa; 6b3800afd99dcd38b113fc74eb7686f5bec8549d; 0388ecfd5a497b4cffc6dc4c260676301b597333; 71000b37e01c568b886e0797a2912ad9cd15dbc8; 576436a5629dc09a79867e82e08a84ada8ce45ae; a65ccd988b24d2b7154ad06681d985eef0328f76; 7cb939c2eddcb18685efc5fec4d80eaa8435550d; 0c66b3b527da0c419d3bbe33c53aca7ffc32e17d; 964a74eb563dd2d1294edba87730e5ad99549553; 13defa260268d07ea1d0620f66603711df28b413; 1c2d68cf0df9386b25ec7e6ca2bdcd4e38b954a3; 25793259a06ee170f5fd3204a23d01173467d745; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 830b2abd0f685b3483df22cc09b46e211a212fa5; 3d9b105c9ef14138e4e1cca19d3c4f0882d8bb28; 0f2fa16537dc407f6f550190bb83895bd55b6d21; 0f38bda7afe5ffc71b5ed1d895acace822ee9399; 9d03c42a4a37e542766feb8cfa8b7ee2e6809bf2; 2eb9ad6aa377f4892cb5dbe016167f522d1db996; dc3864aa28f06a406b10bde9ab636de9249d7944; 5526ad29d2d2a360f974d809a3b3accd83a0a31e; 1abd198f80b3671b44861adb5bb5ddfd97c8b9bc; 804c6d3d02c87982b5d2b91910ef895cc78e2022,Scientific Reports,6,
c228c46f9859c00c90f1c7da5208f9d9ffaf479e,Analysis of SNPs and Haplotypes in Vitamin D Pathway Genes and Renal Cancer Risk,"In the kidney vitamin D is converted to its active form. Since vitamin D exerts its activity through binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), most genetic studies have primarily focused on variation within this gene. Therefore, analysis of genetic variation in VDR and other vitamin D pathway genes may provide insight into the role of vitamin D in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) etiology. RCC cases (N = 777) and controls (N = 1,035) were genotyped to investigate the relationship between RCC risk and variation in eight target genes. Minimum-p-value permutation (Min-P) tests were used to identify genes associated with risk. A three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sliding window was used to identify chromosomal regions with a False Discovery Rate of <10%, where subsequently, haplotype relative risks were computed in Haplostats. Min-P values showed that VDR (p-value = 0.02) and retinoid-X-receptor-alpha (RXRA) (p-value = 0.10) were associated with RCC risk. Within VDR, three haplotypes across two chromosomal regions of interest were identified. The first region, located within intron 2, contained two haplotypes that increased RCC risk by approximately 25%. The second region included a haplotype (rs2239179, rs12717991) across intron 4 that increased risk among participants with the TC (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.09-1.57) haplotype compared to participants with the common haplotype, TT. Across RXRA, one haplotype located 3' of the coding sequence (rs748964, rs3118523), increased RCC risk 35% among individuals with the variant haplotype compared to those with the most common haplotype.

57ff9b791826926d57df0592b43a3cab16fd3347,Toxicological and gene expression analysis of the impact of aflatoxin B1 on hepatic function of male broiler chicks.,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) on hepatic gene expression in male broiler chicks. Seventy-five 1-d-old male broiler chicks were assigned to 3 dietary treatments (5 replicates of 5 chicks each) from hatch to d 21. The diets contained 0, 1 and 2 mg of AFB1/kg of feed. Aflatoxin B1 reduced (P<0.05) feed intake, BW gain, serum total proteins, and serum Ca and P, but increased (P<0.01) liver weights in a dose-dependent manner. Microarray analysis was used to identify shifts in genetic expression associated with the affected physiological processes in chicks fed 0 and 2 mg of AFB1/kg of feed to identify potential targets for pharmacological/toxicological intervention. A loop design was used for microarray experiments with 3 technical and 4 biological replicates per treatment group. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from liver tissue, and its quality was determined using gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. High-quality RNA was purified from DNA contamination, reverse transcribed, and hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray chip. Microarray data were analyzed using a 2-step ANOVA model and validated by quantitative real-time PCR of selected genes. Genes with false discovery rates less than 13% and fold change greater than 1.4 were considered differentially expressed. Compared with controls (0 mg of AFB1/kg), various genes associated with energy production and fatty acid metabolism (carnitine palmitoyl transferase), growth and development (insulin-like growth factor 1), antioxidant protection (glutathione S transferase), detoxification (epoxide hydrolase), coagulation (coagulation factors IX and X), and immune protection (interleukins) were downregulated, whereas genes associated with cell proliferation (ornithine decarboxylase) were upregulated in birds fed 2 mg of AFB1/kg. This study demonstrates that AFB1 exposure at a concentration of 2 mg/kg results in physiological responses associated with altered gene expression in chick livers.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""L P Yarru"", ids = ""13920967""); list(name = ""Raja Sekhar Settivari"", ids = ""4719666""); list(name = ""Eric Antoniou"", ids = ""11196273""); list(name = ""David R.

589fef7999e073a77f810ea36eb00c776dc99dbd,A correction for sample overlap in genome-wide association studies in a polygenic pleiotropy-informed framework,"BackgroundThere is considerable evidence that many complex traits have a partially shared genetic basis, termed pleiotropy. It is therefore useful to consider integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) data across several traits, usually at the summary statistic level. A major practical challenge arises when these GWAS have overlapping subjects. This is particularly an issue when estimating pleiotropy using methods that condition the significance of one trait on the signficance of a second, such as the covariate-modulated false discovery rate (cmfdr).ResultsWe propose a method for correcting for sample overlap at the summary statistic level. We quantify the expected amount of spurious correlation between the summary statistics from two GWAS due to sample overlap, and use this estimated correlation in a simple linear correction that adjusts the joint distribution of test statistics from the two GWAS. The correction is appropriate for GWAS with case-control or quantitative outcomes. Our simulations and data example show that without correcting for sample overlap, the cmfdr is not properly controlled, leading to an excessive number of false discoveries and an excessive false discovery proportion. Our correction for sample overlap is effective in that it restores proper control of the false discovery rate, at very little loss in power.ConclusionsWith our proposed correction, it is possible to integrate GWAS summary statistics with overlapping samples in a statistical framework that is dependent on the joint distribution of the two GWAS.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marissa LeBlanc"", ids = ""145875211""); list(name = ""Verena Zuber"", ids = ""2882566""); list(name = ""Wesley K.

Ignoring dependence among hypotheses tests may lead to loss of efficiency and bias in decision. Misspecification in the non-null distribution, on the other hand, can result in both false positive and false negative errors. Hidden Markov models are used to accommodate the dependence structure among the tests. Dirichlet mixture process prior is applied on the non-null distribution to overcome the potential pitfalls in distribution misspecification. The testing algorithm based on Bayesian techniques optimizes the false negative rate (FNR) while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). The procedure is applied to pointwise and clusterwise analysis. Its performance is compared with existing approaches using both simulated and real data examples.",2019,Medicine; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xia Wang"", ids = ""50142695""); list(name = ""Ali Shojaie"", ids = ""2204469""); list(name = ""Jian Zou"", ids = ""144560746"")",8396fc79b650405e2222532b76d38f3b4745c8a5,,Computational statistics & data analysis,136,"

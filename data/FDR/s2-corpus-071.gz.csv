6792e2205ef0f2e91e1257d4f0b0071cc2518b30,Plasma metabolites and lipids associate with kidney function and kidney volume in hypertensive ADPKD patients early in the disease course,"BackgroundAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease and is characterized by gradual cyst growth and expansion, increase in kidney volume with an ultimate decline in kidney function leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Given the decades long period of stable kidney function while cyst growth occurs, it is important to identify those patients who will progress to ESRD. Recent data from our and other laboratories have demonstrated that metabolic reprogramming may play a key role in cystic epithelial proliferation resulting in cyst growth in ADPKD. Height corrected total kidney volume (ht-TKV) accurately reflects cyst burden and predicts future loss of kidney function. We hypothesize that specific plasma metabolites will correlate with eGFR and ht-TKV early in ADPKD, both predictors of disease progression, potentially indicative of early physiologic derangements of renal disease severity.MethodsTo investigate the predictive role of plasma metabolites on eGFR and/or ht-TKV, we used a non-targeted GC-TOF/MS-based metabolomics approach on hypertensive ADPKD patients in the early course of their disease. Patient data was obtained from the HALT-A randomized clinical trial at baseline including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and measured ht-TKV. To identify individual metabolites whose intensities are significantly correlated with eGFR and ht-TKV, association analyses were performed using linear regression with each metabolite signal level as the primary predictor variable and baseline eGFR and ht-TKV as the continuous outcomes of interest, while adjusting for covariates. Significance was determined by Storeyâ€™s false discovery rate (FDR) q-values to correct for multiple testing.ResultsTwelve metabolites significantly correlated with eGFR and two triglycerides significantly correlated with baseline ht-TKV at FDR q-value <â€‰0.05. Specific significant metabolites, including pseudo-uridine, indole-3-lactate, uric acid, isothreonic acid, and creatinine, have been previously shown to accumulate in plasma and/or urine in both diabetic and cystic renal diseases with advanced renal insufficiency.ConclusionsThis study identifies metabolic derangements in early ADPKD which may be prognostic for ADPKD disease progression.Clinical trialHALT Progression of Polycystic Kidney Disease (HALT PKD) Study A; Clinical www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00283686; first posted January 30, 2006, last update posted March 19, 2015.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyoungmi Kim"", ids = ""145354043""); list(name = ""Josephine F.

To enhance our knowledge of its hydrogenogenic CO metabolism, we performed whole transcriptome analysis of C. pertinax grown under 100% CO or 100% N2 using RNA sequencing. Of the 2577 genes, 36 and 64 genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate adjusted P valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05 when grown under 100% CO or 100% N2, respectively. Most of the DEGs were components of 23 gene clusters, suggesting switch between metabolisms via intensive expression changes in a relatively low number of gene clusters. Of the 9 significantly expressed gene clusters under 100% CO, CODH-II and ECH gene clusters were found. Only the ECH gene cluster was regulated by the CO-responsive transcriptional factor CooA, suggesting that others were separately regulated in the same transcriptional cascade as the ECH gene cluster. Of the 14 significantly expressed gene clusters under 100% N2, ferrous iron transport gene cluster involved in anaerobic respiration and prophage region were found. Considering that the expression of the temperate phage was strictly repressed under 100% CO, hydrogenogenic CO metabolism might be stable for C. pertinax.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuto Fukuyama"", ids = ""9542127""); list(name = ""Kimiho Omae"", ids = ""5546230""); list(name = ""Takashi Yoshida"", ids = ""144441842""); list(name = ""Yoshihiko Sako"", ids = ""21755655"")",,d8765786ba17a7af171de41ab31a25ae353ca08b; 8eba259f4440f1438b3ff82e429535f48410eb3c; 2937b016434499ab843711d306a841f131ed5196; 23425c06b453bf1030bcebbf9101134ceb8a6737; 3bcc45d8ae5eb7dfb9fbec2ddb7b18c4a51cd792; 739953f08b77cb341880588583f7873712aaaf4b; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 88cd5fdbfb2dba16a6b23987d30ad9437ff0c805; f69721c42769224d8295ed9849ca506eb5ed3844; f40748aab3f98b4ec9d199c196466511ff1aba6e; 2f0db013f84df50592c1e84cf214e128b5af04d2; 1dc459513e0939f30cd536b1b48f547aa9afb056; 28400af54127fdd17f9c152ad2e93ad72d9dfc40; ff908b5b3dad27e4b60b7cbcb1ef959520339f6b; eca344388b79332e00d6611e079e9fd401a6d329; 4d2b02b1b8bba5722c5f886b42b45fa5ff9a72b8; e0bdf416f117ecb4ff15a6d3571e105918128934; 24fba94007b9711ff067dda1ef7b441fa2a3cf05; c2e631b240fc28612e8881bc6fcca622ebad4622; 28434f5c570381ed9933c93fd13331963bd7a9d9; cd872f7bb5e87a0eaa1beb1d386d2f8d50bd97c9; 2bed34b40b72ea9629b87a573bf794fbc3fb310c; 8bf7168af86f8fb75a6afb8c693428fe8f6eafa3; 3d275ed35cb19cf1add2f88b012389af38ef8134; 116e8952bfd988ad9ee677c267b00fd6f04c007a; c6d6df9ac6291770b38191797cefdcf39adfa176; 5569c911b5be892a6aff1b604f7707602dca85b1; 964404598b566ba2aea0c098199901d3092496ff; 76dd7d2d69123a48dcdad0c6e5f198661bb4fc50; 3f96d80015f8785a2365d853276704f5dcc6bc6b; 0a635bccbf31c4b1806312853d4d14768b7f0a3a; c01c7b82922c7492a2186d30f83561ebca3ea6f1; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; 60e7089108eac813ddb25ceedcea0f86378c91ff; 9085127c1717dbcbe2e32a14b4373918c0886110; b5cbc1ee1fde6ba838bc5bb15846ba792c659aa2; 648d59af78fcf100feecefd9d2ebe705f855de9c; 015ac1bcc847289f85f0353b44769f595041381f; 8b7a6c847ec518c4ab3da70478569c656f925ced; cdbe8a265ef4bd8350722d2209fc6cc6290da1b3; f68a40477f349bf050b4ad7c3b4c8a427ee1f9e3; 1e3427a853e3f6d683773ea44db4b6d18dd90eb8; 473a268a1af7a670f00029c887d6e9e590683d24; fa35a70b6282f7cdbff71d9b56850aa1f3c3a8c7; a59ed334065c80dea8b313342e7f64b829030b27; 912b9c9f243d92dee27ac75baaa9672f9bf580d0; 360e2aaec649a25895feba096727c314e235774b; c008e7ac3a0a09e10fc9bca1f62d7f09c4391400; 6d8ac77e98c992ab0eeff90b5c852baa060e6fbf; 06088e91172728a03f62d9cd8352014356c10e47; c101f38b8d219e466c1770a933dd8283454e5ba3; 62f5ffb09a4c9543509c38f005b9c6eb308c6974; 3f6ad0c1272aa320d05137f55837dbb4824ef2d7; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; d1f61d84b330a39b84e89753489611e0b801a8ee; 038efcbf31f6de328a764c7ba4c4f047630e2b74; 4f707c12b2fd6440dc6b12b461693eeb5259f634; 66d4dd24c454fd7b11f1091b9efc40db954700be; a82d7e0dc7b2d3a1b159e0902bb9f3017788a786,Extremophiles,23,389 - 398
60468a0645a75c75cefce79b957eb621477af315,Frequentist q-values for multiple-test procedures,"Multiple-test procedures are increasingly important as technology in- creases scientistsâ€™ ability to make large numbers of multiple measurements, as they do in genome scans. Multiple-test procedures were originally defined to input a vector of input p-values and an uncorrected critical p-value, interpreted as a fami- lywise error rate or a false discovery rate, and to output a corrected critical p-value and a discovery set, defined as the subset of input p-values that are at or below the corrected critical p-value. A range of multiple-test procedures is implemented us- ing the smileplot package in Stata (Newson and the ALSPAC Study Team 2003, Stata Journal 3: 109â€“132; 2010, Stata Journal 10: 691â€“692). The qqvalue com- mand uses an alternative formulation of multiple-test procedures, which is also used by the R function p.adjust. qqvalue inputs a variable of p-values and out- puts a variable of q-values that are equal in each observation to the minimum familywise error rate or false discovery rate that would result in the inclusion of the corresponding p-value in the discovery set if the specified multiple-test pro- cedure was applied to the full set of input p-values.

Since clinical management is strongly influenced by this staging system, we looked at molecular fingerprints of GEJ tumors and compared to gastric and esophagus profiles, to elucidate whether GEJ cluster in the gastric or esophagus cancer groups, according to mRNA expression pattern, since this might represent tumor identity. Methods: The clinical and expression data were downloaded from TCGA. The total number of samples was 1167 ( 450 stomach, 196 esophagus and 521 colon samples). Both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Heat Map (HM) plots were performed in R platform, using Log2 transformation of RPKM normalized data. Differential Expression Analysis was also performed in R, using RAW data and the DESeq2 package. Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate corrections were used.

43128b0ea674f15c08f88008ffd2e8829ab86c87,"Quantitative analysis of glycerophospholipids by LC-MS: acquisition, data handling, and interpretation.","As technology expands what it is possible to accurately measure, so too the challenges faced by modern mass spectrometry applications expand. A high level of accuracy in lipid quantitation across thousands of chemical species simultaneously is demanded. While relative changes in lipid amounts with varying conditions may provide initial insights or point to novel targets, there are many questions that require determination of lipid analyte absolute quantitation. Glycerophospholipids present a significant challenge in this regard, given the headgroup diversity, large number of possible acyl chain combinations, and vast range of ionization efficiency of species. Lipidomic output is being used more often not just for profiling of the masses of species, but also for highly-targeted flux-based measurements which put additional burdens on the quantitation pipeline. These first two challenges bring into sharp focus the need for a robust lipidomics workflow including deisotoping, differentiation from background noise, use of multiple internal standards per lipid class, and the use of a scriptable environment in order to create maximum user flexibility and maintain metadata on the parameters of the data analysis as it occurs. As lipidomics technology develops and delivers more output on a larger number of analytes, so must the sophistication of statistical post-processing also continue to advance. High-dimensional data analysis methods involving clustering, lipid pathway analysis, and false discovery rate limitation are becoming standard practices in a maturing field.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David S.

b38eeec1c63fed013262fe34286042d11bb96609,"Higher Criticism for Large-Scale Inference, Especially for Rare and Weak Effects","In modern high-throughput data analysis, researchers perform a large number of statistical tests, expecting to nd perhaps a small fraction of signicant eects against a predominantly null background. Higher Criticism (HC) was introduced to determine whether there are any non-zero eects; more recently, it was applied to feature selection, where it provides a method for selecting useful predictive features from a large body of potentially useful features, among which only a rare few will prove truly useful. In this article, we review the basics of HC in both the testing and feature selection settings. HC is a exible idea, which adapts easily to new situations; we point out how it adapts to clique detection and bivariate outlier detection. HC, although still early in its development, is seeing increasing interest from practitioners; we illustrate this with worked examples. HC is computationally eective, which gives it a nice leverage in the increasingly more relevant \Big Data"" settings we see today. We also review the underlying theoretical \ideology"" behind HC. The Rare/Weak (RW) model is a theoretical framework simultaneously controlling the size and prevalence of useful/signicant items among the useless/null bulk. The RW model shows that HC has important advantages over better known procedures such as False Discovery Rate (FDR) control and Family-wise Error control (FwER), in particular, certain optimality properties. We discuss the rare/weak phase diagram, a way to visualize clearly the class of RW settings where the true signals are so rare or so weak that detection and feature selection are simply impossible, and a way to understand the known optimality properties of HC.

edf610ad43b826b84bc67619c91fb5f9e7d558f9,The identification of functional motifs in temporal gene expression analysis,"The identification of transcription factor binding sites is essential to the understanding of the regulation of gene expression and the reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks. The in silico identification of cis-regulatory motifs is challenging due to sequence variability and lack of sufficient data to generate consensus motifs that are of quantitative or even qualitative predictive value. To determine functional motifs in gene expression, we propose a strategy to adopt false discovery rate (FDR) and estimate motif effects to evaluate combinatorial analysis of motif candidates and temporal gene expression data. The method decreases the number of predicted motifs, which can then be confirmed by genetic analysis. To assess the method we used simulated motif/expression data to evaluate parameters. We applied this approach to experimental data for a group of iron responsive genes in Salmonella typhimurium 14028S. The method identified known and potentially new ferric-uptake regulator (Fur) binding sites. In addition, we identified uncharacterized functional motif candidates that correlated with specific patterns of expression.

4a3c95ec9ca3a74b1b0667571b3e451ef8e9873f,Increased iron deposition of deep cerebral gray matter structures in hemodialysis patients: A longitudinal study using quantitative susceptibility mapping,"BACKGROUND
The cerebral iron overload in hemodialysis patients has been reported in a previous study, in which the evaluation of the changes in iron content could be affected by the cross-sectional analysis.


PURPOSE
To investigate the longitudinal changes of iron deposition in hemodialysis patients using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and correlate these findings with the longitudinal changes of neurocognitive function and clinical factors.


STUDY TYPE
Prospective; longitudinal.


POPULATION
In all, 34 patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs); the mean follow-up interval was 22â€‰Â±â€‰7 months.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
3.0T, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI).


ASSESSMENT
QSM reconstructed from original phase data of SWI was used to measure the susceptibility of gray matter structures including bilateral caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP), putmen (PUT), red nucleus (RN), substantia nigra (SN), dentate nucleus (DN), thalamus (THA), pulvinar of thalamus (PT). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test and clinical factors were recorded.


STATISTICAL TESTING
Analysis of covariance adjusting for age and gender as covariates or a paired t-test for the differences in susceptibility, MMSE scores, and clinical factors among baseline, follow-up patients, and HCs. Correlation and stepwise regression analysis for the relationship between susceptibility, MMSE scores, and clinical factors.


RESULTS
The susceptibility of bilateral CN, GP, PUT, RN, SN, DN, THA, PT in follow-up patients was significantly higher than that in baseline between patients and HCs except for left THA (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05; Bonferroni corrected). MMSE scores significantly negatively correlated with the susceptibility of bilateral CN, PUT, and RRN in the baseline examination and bilateral CN, PUT, RN, and DN in the follow-up examination (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05; false discovery rate [FDR] corrected). The follow-up interval, creatinine, phosphorus, and calcium were independent factors for the increased susceptibility of some nuclei (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).


DATA CONCLUSION
The iron deposition of gray matter nuclei in hemodialysis patients increased over roughly a 2-year period and may be a risk factor for neurocognitive impairment. Creatinine and abnormal calcium-phosphorus metabolism were independent risk factors for abnormal iron deposition.

We determined PMP differences between patients with COPD who died an average of 2â€‰years after enrollment (Non-survivors, NS) compared to those who survived (S) and also with age matched controls (C).MethodsWe studied prospectively 90 patients with severe COPD and 30 controls. NS were divided in discovery and validation cohorts (30 patients each) and the results compared to the PMP of 30â€‰S and C. All participants completed lung function tests, dyspnea scores, quality of life, exercise capacity, BODE index, and plasma metabolomics by liquid and gas chromatography / mass spectometry (LC/MS, LC/MS2, GC/MS). Statistically, we used Random Forest Analysis (RFA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine metabolites that differentiated the 3 groups and compared the ability of metabolites vs. clinical characteristics to classify patients into survivors and non-survivors.ResultsThere were 79 metabolites statistically different between S and NS [pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and false discovery rate (q value) <â€‰0.1]. RFA and SVM classification of COPD survivors and non-survivors had a predicted accuracy of 74 and 85% respectively. Elevation of tricyclic acid cycle intermediates branched amino acids depletion and increase in lactate, fructose and xylonate showed the most relevant differences between S vs. NS suggesting alteration in mitochondrial oxidative energy generation.

Obesity has been associated with increased colon cancer risk. Although the molecular pathways underlying the obesity-colon cancer link are unknown, one hypothesis is obesity induces a chronic inflammatory state which increases cancer risk. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. There is little known about whether differential expression of miRs affects the ability of obesity to promote cancer. To test the hypothesis that obesity promotes colon tumorigenesis through alteration of cytokine and miR expression, we utilized an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced model of colon cancer in FVB mice. Colon tumorigenesis was initiated in FVB mice with AOM and mice were subsequently administered a high fat (45% kcal from fat) or control diet (10% kcal from fat). Tumorigenesis and cytokine expression was determined 5, 10, and 20 weeks after AOM. Expression of miRs was determined at 5 and 10 weeks after AOM.

Obesity promoted tumor progression 20 weeks after AOM compared to the control group. The obese mice had an average of 12.0 Â± 1.3 tumors per mouse, while the control mice had an average of 9.2 Â± 1.8 tumors per mouse (p<0.0001).

Cytokine levels were measured 5, 10, and 20 weeks after the last injection of AOM to investigate the role of inflammation in obesity-promoted colon tumorigenesis. Ten different cytokines were measured from the serum of mice in each group. Six cytokines were significantly altered 5 weeks after the last injection of AOM among the mice fed a high fat diet. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly higher in obese mice compared to control mice. In addition, all of these cytokines remained significantly altered in the obese mice at 10 and 20 weeks after AOM.

Expression of miRs was determined 5 and 10 weeks after AOM to determine if miRs were differentially expressed among treatment groups. Microarray data demonstrated in a comparison of the high fat group versus the control group, fourteen miRs were differentially expressed with a false discovery rate less than 0.05. Real time PCR was used to validate ten of these miRs. At both 5 and 10 weeks post AOM, five miRs were validated to be significantly downregulated in mice on a high fat diet compared to those on a control diet. These miRs included miR-138, miR-150, miR-34c, let-7f, and miR-16. In addition, two miRs, miR-155 and miR-196, were validated to be significantly upregulated in the mice on a high fat diet at both 5 and 10 weeks post AOM.

This study supports the hypothesis that obesity contributes to an increased inflammatory environment which may lead to increased colon tumor growth. Furthermore, differential expression of miRs may be involved in promoting colon tumor growth induced by obesity.

Previous studies had proved that hippocampal volume has predictive value for antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the exact subregion of the hippocampus relevant to the predictive role of antidepressants response is not known.


PURPOSE
To explore which hippocampal subfield volumes might predict an early response to first-time use of antidepressants in drug-naÃ¯ve MDD patients.


STUDY TYPE
Prospective.


POPULATION
Thirty-eight drug-naÃ¯ve MDD patients (mean illness durationâ€‰=â€‰1.6 years) and 55 healthy control subjects (HCS).


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
3.0T MRI, T1 -weighted, 3D, SPGR sequence.


ASSESSMENT
The hippocampal subfields and total intracranial volume were measured with FreeSurfer. The response to antidepressants was evaluated by the reduction rate of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (RRS) after a 6-week routine clinical antidepressant treatment.


STATISTICAL TESTS
The relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and RRS was explored using partial correlation analysis. Volume differences among early responding patients (ERP), nonresponding patients (NRP), and HCS were examined by multivariate analysis of covariance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of volumes as predictors.


RESULTS
NRP had significantly larger volumes than both ERP and HCS in bilateral subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA) 1 and left CA2/3, CA4/dentate gyrus (DG) (all P < 0.01, false discovery rate corrected). Significant negative correlations were found between the RRS and volumes of left subiculum (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), CA2/3 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008), and CA4/DG (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) in the whole MDD group. ROC analysis demonstrated that the left subiculum exhibited the highest accuracy for differentiating NRP from ERP, with a sensitivity of 76.9% and specificity of 80%.


DATA CONCLUSION
These findings propose that volumes of certain hippocampal subfields may be associated with antidepressant treatment and this has potential use in clinical applications for treatment selection in patients with MDD at an early stage.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between RIPK1 polymorphisms and cervical cancer risk among the Uyghur population. We performed a case-control study including 342 cervical cancer patients and 498 age-matched healthy controls. Four RIPK1 genetic variants (rs6907943, rs2077681, rs9503400 and rs17548629) were genotyped with Agena MassARRAY platform. The associations between RIPK1 polymorphisms and cervical cancer risk were assessed under Binary logistic regression models. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to improve the results reliability. The results showed rs2077681 was significantly associated with cervical cancer risk under various genetic models (codominant: ORâ€‰=â€‰3.14, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.40â€“7.07, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006, FDR-pâ€‰=â€‰0.018; recessive: ORâ€‰=â€‰3.20, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.43â€“7.16, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005, FDR-0.018). The stratified analysis indicated that the relationships of rs6907946, rs9503400 and rs17548629 with cervical cancer risk were statistically significant in the subgroup of clinical stage (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Our findings demonstrated that RIPK1 polymorphisms were associated with cervical cancer susceptibility among the Uyghur population in China, and RIPK1 polymorphisms might be involved in the development of cervical cancer.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zulipiyamu Tuoheti"", ids = ""1622438579""); list(name = ""Lili Han"", ids = ""48442282""); list(name = ""Sulaiya Husaiyin"", ids = ""10368196""); list(name = ""Xiaoxi Liu"", ids = ""49543111""); list(name = ""Chunhua Ma"", ids = ""77528593""); list(name = ""Mayinuer Niyazi"", ids = ""8521330"")",,9a8b7343af4d514b808e3356d531d239801b1573; 3700875ffb13199784110b4bd566e504a7da7b5b; ca861ee62d86ec6cff3100b8aa055e0290303b00; d9c1756638248630cdc73deeb671195b4f631674; d9aabb916114b7bf04504733ec37390bab76b717; 58eb0d8e0da9837dfb4e63d5f9c097f46c03daf0; d09b283ea6f7c1227024b12025eab86ff8f7553c; c00e281fa868ab96dd86a743eb7eb8ff67b39152; ae644fcccfb0e74fa0e4f9c1b96c49fa42a0a74a; 377c15ac77388259b10f6c2aba04118241aebdd5; 196221beb48fdd5d240c25bca46a6147c2883708; b1535d7b5c9c11c851e974f8755eabbd922b6bb0; 83aaded3488b152aa6a2a16d7b5a84848a9efbb9; e9b0576c07a2d9496a5f06657d5d65dfebbc7ade; 63d12d1ede0416c9ae9e749a0015886869494f7b; 299e97f912e111bf9524d1e4a440c24d43261e1b; c3da703879ea9f7f39856ec6acbf958205e3a219; 20af71572e94a569edcc69e7e6162955a739ab82; 692649eadecc102f8efbf858c5f41154c504ddd7; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; 5b5ea3c5a8d8622f54e570b42ec208f718ed50a6; 5bd5e9f64d0f30d6bb4b39aa2aea00b484f860e0; fe35e0540f560baf6b79ad561aad1e3da5f934e1; 53aaca2be49ec6729c3847408eeae7523aab71de; f1dbaa5c6c67eb6bb398d5c338272982249cd76f; bee3ac51f1cd7b88e3ae2e44244210f82cc165b7; 15705dcb9da7a448ba220a37d0ea7e81ddb7ba6b; 097595837f49434723fd4e24502fb23aa4037428,BMC Cancer,20,

Here we measured methylation levels at 22,290 CpG dinucleotides in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 77 HapMap Yoruba individuals, for which genome-wide gene expression and genotype data were also available.ResultsAssociation analyses of methylation levels with more than three million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 180 CpG-sites in 173 genes that were associated with nearby SNPs (putatively in cis, usually within 5 kb) at a false discovery rate of 10%. The most intriguing trans signal was obtained for SNP rs10876043 in the disco-interacting protein 2 homolog B gene (DIP2B, previously postulated to play a role in DNA methylation), that had a genome-wide significant association with the first principal component of patterns of methylation; however, we found only modest signal of trans-acting associations overall. As expected, we found significant negative correlations between promoter methylation and gene expression levels measured by RNA-sequencing across genes. Finally, there was a significant overlap of SNPs that were associated with both methylation and gene expression levels.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate a strong genetic component to inter-individual variation in DNA methylation profiles. Furthermore, there was an enrichment of SNPs that affect both methylation and gene expression, providing evidence for shared mechanisms in a fraction of genes.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jordana T Bell"", ids = ""144891066""); list(name = ""Athma A.

In this randomized and double-blinded crossover study, we investigated the systemic effect on bioactive lipid metabolite levels after controlled biodiesel exhaust exposure of healthy humans and compared it to filtered air at a separate exposure occasion. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins, as well as endocannabinoids and related lipids, were quantified in plasma from 14 healthy volunteers at baseline and at three subsequent time points (2, 6, and 24â€¯h) after 1 h exposure sessions. Protocols based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods were developed to detect temporal changes in circulating levels after biodiesel exhaust exposure. The exhaust was generated by a diesel engine fed with an undiluted rapeseed methyl ester fuel. Among the 51 analyzed lipid metabolites, PGF2Î±, 9,10-DiHOME, 9-HODE, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and DEA displayed significant responsiveness to the biodiesel exhaust exposure as opposed to filtered air. Of these, 9-HODE and 5-HETE at 24â€¯h survived the 10% false discovery rate cutoff (pâ€¯<â€¯0.003). Hence, the majority of the responsive lipid metabolites were monohydroxy fatty acids. We conclude that it is possible to detect alterations in circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in response to biodiesel exhaust exposure using LC-MS/MS, with emphasis on metabolites with inflammation related properties and implications on cardiovascular health and disease. These observations aid future investigations on air pollution effects, especially with regard to cardiovascular outcomes.",2018,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Sandra Gouveia-Figueira"", ids = ""1398320668""); list(name = ""Masoumeh Karimpour"", ids = ""10018280""); list(name = ""Jenny A.

1e8b6f060f75bee16514d2221507c931bb965e26,Integrative Genome-Wide Gene Expression Profiling of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma in Czech Republic and in the United States,"Gene expression microarray and next generation sequencing efforts on conventional, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have been mostly performed in North American and Western European populations, while the highest incidence rates are found in Central/Eastern Europe. We conducted whole-genome expression profiling on 101 pairs of ccRCC tumours and adjacent non-tumour renal tissue from Czech patients recruited within the ""K2 Study"", using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips to explore the molecular variations underlying the biological and clinical heterogeneity of this cancer. Differential expression analysis identified 1650 significant probes (fold change â‰¥2 and false discovery rate <0.05) mapping to 630 up- and 720 down-regulated unique genes. We performed similar statistical analysis on the RNA sequencing data of 65 ccRCC cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and identified 60% (402) of the downregulated and 74% (469) of the upregulated genes found in the K2 series. The biological characterization of the significantly deregulated genes demonstrated involvement of downregulated genes in metabolic and catabolic processes, excretion, oxidation reduction, ion transport and response to chemical stimulus, while simultaneously upregulated genes were associated with immune and inflammatory responses, response to hypoxia, stress, wounding, vasculature development and cell activation. Furthermore, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 317 TCGA ccRCC/adjacent non-tumour renal tissue pairs indicated that deregulation of approximately 7% of genes could be explained by epigenetic changes. Finally, survival analysis conducted on 89 K2 and 464 TCGA cases identified 8 genes associated with differential prognostic outcomes. In conclusion, a large proportion of ccRCC molecular characteristics were common to the two populations and several may have clinical implications when validated further through large clinical cohorts.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Magdalena B.

Gene expression profiling in peripheral blood cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in response to anti-TNFtreatments. Physiol Genomics 43: 365â€“371, 2011. First published January 25, 2011; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00127.2010.â€”The efficacy of anti-TNFtherapies highlights the role of TNFin the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the mechanism of action of these agents is poorly understood at the molecular level. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of anti-TNFtreatment on the global gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of responder RA patients. Changes in gene expression were determined using oligonucleotide microarrays (25,341 genes) in PBMCs obtained before and after 12 wk of treatment with either etanercept or adalimumab from responder RA patients. Two hundred fifty-one genes displayed significant changes (false discovery rate 0.1%) in expression level (178 upregulations with mean fold change 1.5 and 73 downregulations with mean fold change 1.50) after 12 wk of treatment. Importantly, the expression of several genes, including those coding for the calcium binding proteins S100A12 and A8, CD14 antigen, Selectin P, or ribosomal protein L39, reported to be upregulated in RA patients, were found to be decreased after anti-TNFtreatment. Globally, inflammation, immune response, apoptosis, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial oxido-reduction were the most affected pathways in response to anti-TNFtreatment. The obtained gene expression signature in PBMCs provides new information to better understand the mechanisms of action of anti-TNFtreatment in RA patients.",2011,,"list(name = ""Emmanuelle Meugnier"", ids = ""152392293""); list(name = ""Fabienne Coury"", ids = ""1837613""); list(name = ""Jacques Tebib"", ids = ""6024823""); list(name = ""Carole Ferraro-Peyret"", ids = ""5793384""); list(name = ""Sophie Rome"", ids = ""145793113""); list(name = ""Jacques Michel Jean Bienvenu"", ids = ""3783775""); list(name = ""Hubert Vidal"", ids = ""50767228""); list(name = ""Jean Sibilia"", ids = ""4319348""); list(name = ""Nicole Fabien"", ids = ""4035054"")",0457a3bbb4c8ae7a43fed654ae140be905aae3cf; 68d63e7a54a94dedf69fa78adb220d8864b61716; c2c71461ff61fe87153a5e484a8f4e755d5e65cd,3014ec7737320b6dd9233c340970c88581503ec9; eb6be4a0186cbda3ebaaa8fc1a6203c196aef189; 0dc29796cac34e00a78ec4be561a1a09bdf65b94; 4b8233ebef9cdaf2ba742afb13876ae45cc4c1a8; a0500a369d6fa68f9ffa0e3b4cbe5dfdd47ba9e3; fa11c883f905679dce54dc9dabc05a87d1c7edab; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; be30e9e37430717aac82e8fd3752bb709170943a; 8d855b48af5d4cc22fc5f5c697c87a45b427726f; c8e590e8272a4d4e5da5be72c34b2fcd196819c0; 2a890b06d9ad65c80acaeae941d0b4f3b5986896; 4bd40527a78e0d73f39b1978ff19604479c6ae23; a80c902e66e92918ac66945f410dcaf0de36e0c4; 1bac26f3cca4899f79343d274e4a9fb01b98e8a1; 6069d060d1c8670e7e1541f79f2b5a1f1fd2b204; 0a9fd57ace8e6428f67ee17ffe231d835d2d6c24; a56a40d58315aec2ae45e143399e117a8685bf86; 1a54de39f72b7eeee2dcedcac43ed8b5afe2d359; 267be3bf1c3e08f3bcccc89e3c9c7afe42529d05; 839d44538152f4793e5dd9cbb3d56db20397931b; fd212eea46a231b8e545d22bc6607ac7d66738b4; 4ec685b0026ecab9fa6519a7449a77ab45e38037; ecfc16b918d728bad2dc35e4dcea23714a196a03; fa2a5a82919cc2a3bbefd42f89eea451c81954b3; 30892dbc941297bf28721ebac01bcab6d7893d25; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; fbbccfd4002433d8b748f2a33cc2b894ec1a1b14; 3b4616263ee43b8aae9f3fbd479c8e1025e5d502; cc72a0359e66a34332bba012c445ef3a7e7b7eef; 59a9712f710a410d21ed459f8068d9b1b8fb9c54; 204f1752135f87e0a6992d527d47f1149ecc6a70; 7bf03b8c7ce8e2c40c698bb0ce69e5e2404b3adc; b7593ee3e23278e659d5ea8f91bee0fa4f5738d6; 3333d1e2303c671129e344d3d328583c6269ce11; 90fdaa2b2c3fe4718105462b16687707167d37e2; 2a576180ea1d74ec0c4c844f720edb244d9c1d15; d6e215d4a32c130994acd62c220174292564615c; 1032bb74c018112ff4de6c24b828563d05bc14c0; adc79a3a07f40f8e0d5760eebe1b8b7df09e9b0b; c7772f3ea63246e566984f6a61ab845336fe04d9; 313709c13d106ce58522f415a2eec7957f428907; 96667e2b233d128c501508f12c99da37be7fda7a; 81b46ae93bbffe03bd8b1d84e9f2db03b9fb3e5a; d7aabd8db8122b5a731d750e0e66208aa4d9f5af; f134e0e68e888dc1d064b2da4cbeff4af6a8b269,,,
b0fc50c2670719622c0d4350d513d03ad9e31d11,Etoposide-induced DNA damage affects multiple cellular pathways in addition to DNA damage response,"DNA damage response (DDR) coordinates lesion repair and checkpoint activation. DDR is intimately connected with transcription. However, the relationship between DDR and transcription has not been clearly established. We report here RNA-sequencing analyses of MCF7 cells containing double-strand breaks induced by etoposide. While etoposide does not apparently cause global changes in mRNA abundance, it altered some gene expression. At the setting of fold alteration â‰¥ 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.001, FDR < 0.05, or p < 0.05, etoposide upregulated 96, 268, or 860 genes and downregulated 41, 133, or 503 genes in MCF7 cells. Among these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the processes of biogenesis, metabolism, cell motility, signal transduction, and others were affected; the pathways of Ras GTPase activity, RNA binding, cytokine-mediated signaling, kinase regulatory activity, protein binding, and translation were upregulated, and those pathways related to coated vesicle, calmodulin binding, and microtubule-based movement were downregulated. We further identified RABL6, RFTN2, FAS-AS1, and TCEB3CL as new DDR-affected genes in MCF7 and T47D cells. By metabolic labelling using 4-thiouridine, we observed dynamic alterations in the transcription of these genes in etoposide-treated MCF7 and T47D cells. During 0-2 hour etoposide treatment, RABL6 transcription was robustly increased at 0.5 and 1 hour in MCF7 cells and at 2 hours in T47D cells, while FAS-AS1 transcription was dramatically and steadily elevated in both cell lines. Taken together, we demonstrate dynamic alterations in transcription and that these changes affect multiple cellular processes in etoposide-induced DDR.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fengxiang Wei"", ids = ""36884598""); list(name = ""Peng Hao"", ids = ""145139467""); list(name = ""Xiangzhong Zhang"", ids = ""4703428""); list(name = ""Haiyan Hu"", ids = ""145431913""); list(name = ""Dan Jiang"", ids = ""144805948""); list(name = ""Aihua Yin"", ids = ""2326395""); list(name = ""Lijuan Wen"", ids = ""3338295""); list(name = ""Lihong Zheng"", ids = ""49537780""); list(name = ""Jeffrey Zheru He"", ids = ""46260012""); list(name = ""Wenjuan Mei"", ids = ""8333318""); list(name = ""Hui Zeng"", ids = ""143936507""); list(name = ""Damu Tang"", ids = ""49534875"")",87c99f3020496b8de1c391c9b3dbe5adab8075fc,ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; 5cd54eef1c9e052ae370eb7075607449bbf78b94; 02dc138b57add5a235d8781bbd59eca91f9b3c33; 0bc820632c998676ae080e97bbd5baaa3c57de72; 42c1ed441648af9f0f75be8c360f1bd9223b0037; 489f6c61536c2fd76c6e18f0554dea3e29a5be59; d9a0bfb754588975fc334fa9e4f2171a2be3f9ac; 3d8565ced1b91cc08259bf0335259666e87c0099; d5e833ae51e336de2a47abd539d65c28dd8fe6ec; 6e87be1dea451bab1664eba58a987845cbde82b9; fd44fb62e1ca2e1b0a07a9914c2c6b0ade826b24; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; ccbb4165c832c7bedb29504fdbb25b0ca0f8c08b; 4c4c6c4fdb68f3b977a5713421af93ff70557fa9; ef002f4d455be71ea7ba246ff55b63b7fd2bf926; 2340e292246077612e119c81f4f1ef79004ef763; 45c1a7bad4f0bcd029c70da24ca9bd6214b6d6d0; 866a96dc9e376719d1431dab33941d80f4f43042; d1495178a80b8e7b4ec8d9f2bffead95fdb9a513; 0f13eb2dafc15c3ffb40b144bf53da2f2233c00b; 33f22cc519eb0e71dd581fe7add5c131ba4faacc; 0955d02911e392b568927873ce0f4d31834164e2; 3d832eceaaade632f418fa148759fc3a7a789d0a; 8324796cc62fcadb1355d237b55f08e7f1086912; 54983f0eca0ab2bc3c6c3ee71530c130f30298a5; 6c173bdb7a2641f6c12355ffd833e1f6433997ff; 57dbab6b33d9708488c848c3ab0f55022ea92bba; 83d3788b31f59ee62474012041f7b48ef9703f85; 19a5fff9251ea67bb9583aeb964c4752aab3a4fd; b2d859279f087d0ba53ccc0876b0656ba068e117; f1b88bb2a9a84c95f9f269c2236fb6673e26ead6; e6e04c21693768dccb45f1dbb34b8413a2a01e3f; 34c3e13fca055e6247e254e0f0e2e2572e9d08b0; a7c8ed6c443eeae25340ea444b967d2a3fe1c973; 7238bcc9c365e02f9f72547a60d093f8212d65fb; c967cd5c9f31f612305d829d91d7e5bfb925020a; 24c44cc20dd1829ec44d75ec4c5e8158aa365ab3; d50458c350897b517ac409a568b941e13f071e76; 0e460f718b09ec4c96eca1e7feda459da735732c; 68a2b61f95a80e254ab923af22c62c13ec3658ce; 2830cf5a89339af3ccf8cad2a31ac01e027ad2e4; 74cc71c7b6420c609661448835518f2b6835b1f6; 5c8580fd9da0815c7fa2734e27deecc1593cd349; 57543a22d50b7f31fe5dd46717e6b674c3b156b8; 6d810a69b8dd759e1d7d4ea55da1364d0962941a; 737c1a0716ba5656b75e737922de4c9bbe564317; 639daa51418b21e72f7794ebfdc7586104115501; 105eb6eac347b8a00ccd7a696194da124423ed6d; 99d9d94b4ac24df7ba9eb033e001178f0f524cf8; 592b03e987433f18257c2dd04cc65be101806523; b558871d55a22f7f24b59231c6c00bda151ef447; 1042de04ce1815c30308387a75cce1f57b0599c5; 64f0be68bab9ed37246e6d5635a0d5cf97afb90d; 548ee572b525fd7d9e656c6b1e5b2f428332778b; ef9f7e98cdde7612c7ea3f98c429d5e1a8bc1218; 1c0e09ce7ac51a0d04c9ef05204d8b1ea22d5800; 9c06505bae9f07e5e494f4abd6b23359cd3cab27; 7a6496dc0dd8dd328f61501a7380124225dafff4; 02db925b49b2c7cb4fcc7b321280440837a3eec3; 2f9311ac547f9b153d3ff9ffdc11c149fd2e988a; 2186d9441634115d485446af3bae2ed78a000ebe; 7fa68a29904f4d891d6f4145abb5ec9d3bcafdb1; f5bae9765e8494cfd4a92b043d64a0e5780984af; a34ba429d5aad2c78ad4c61cb91389edd0dfa853; 2071cdf79266282382782dbde06b03ce0b63731b; 675da7ce40878870e42846d66b3dbbdf67f6f9a2; d0e6f012728747f5d49079de015a6289625dbe71; cf36e70505b6b8bad25c7fe79a01111e89a4c385; 1eba3a2ef06f9fc0d6255fb8b7fe58e63e748c6d; 38198dfe7425860b169dd528e026047f0c6fdd4b; d624065af0b1202dff46c0a28c01d3c8596b2c52; f9464d791d57874b2944edb482f5476cb08d6152; 4db74327bf56effd25f23adc5d9035b2db265f1b; fec37dc32be6127aa86a5669c64bf5e4ced00fbb; ee198be83b2d8911f125db24c3e7169fd0ea599c; b8b7dfca90dbb15ad538505e18ec7550cc26a1eb; 9a896fa073281e7003a4a531bef3a9ce0fe51a34; a9fed445a87f8d45c39d124dc218fd149124a316; d99e01ecc14a37acfb03d525c7bec5d67c2adb26; 176490c7bbb20b5a64aca49d9dc3b75bdfd76d67; 096dc25c67ab169bc15166a937f9c5554c420ab1; 2381333d37a9cea3fbec707b8a046f9942049f28; a593fff595adb844acc8c812ba6b7fde9de9df74; 0caad3c425eca567a6067e4c60d727dd16061b09; b353fb2c90f06ca9cd19539a50d93387dcb833ff; e1e34751f8c48233102b3dfe9285e25d739fa523; 4ec6bbbf9fd490d38983c83f420c541fa164983e,Oncotarget,9,24122 - 24139
9e07c3dda144e9fcb6724fae9dacc96938ef2b5e,Gene expression profile analyze the molecular mechanism of CXCR7 regulating papillary thyroid carcinoma growth and metastasis,"BackgroundTo detect genetic expression profile alterations after papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cells transfected with chemokine receptor CXCR7 gene by gene microarray, and gain insights into molecular mechanisms of how CXCR7 regulating PTC growth and metastasis.MethodsThe Human OneArray microarray was used for a complete genome-wide transcript profiling of CXCR7 transfected PTCs (K1-CXCR7 cells), defined as experimental group. Non CXCR7 transfected PTCs (K1 cells) were used as control group. Differential analysis for per gene was performed with a random variance model and t test, p values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate. Gene ontology (GO) on differentially expressed genes to identify the biological processes in modulating the progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Pathway analysis was used to evaluate the signaling pathway that differentially expressed genes were involved in. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and Western blot were used to verify the top differentially expression genes.ResultsComparative analysis revealed that the expression level of 1149 genes was changed in response to CXCR7 transfection. After unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, 270 differentially expressed genes were filtered, of them 156 genes were up-regulated whereas 114 genes were down-regulated in K1-CXCR7 cells. GO enrichment analysis revealed the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in biopolymer metabolic process, signal transduction and protein metabolism. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in ECM-receptor interaction, Focal adhesion, MAPK signaling pathway and Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. More importantly, the expression level of genes closely associated with tumor growth and metastasis was altered significantly in K1-CXCR7 cells, including up-regulated genes FN1, COL1A1, COL4A1, PDGFRB, LTB, CXCL12, MMP-11, MT1-MMP and down-regulated genes ITGA7, and Notch-1.ConclusionsGene expression profiling analysis of papillary thyroid carcinoma can further delineate the mechanistic insights on how CXCR7 regulating papillary thyroid carcinoma growth and metastasis. CXCR7 may regulate growth and metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma via the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway and its downstream NF-ÎºB signaling, as well as the down-regulation of Notch signaling.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hengwei Zhang"", ids = ""48212617""); list(name = ""Xuyong Teng"", ids = ""39174686""); list(name = ""Zhangyi Liu"", ids = ""47781272""); list(name = ""Lei Zhang"", ids = ""1684635""); list(name = ""Zhen Liu"", ids = ""39032863"")",1a70741f26c6b51afea5b0bae889660491f06e81; 31d6bef5235dbe4ee46aa033f21a5657bffdbf65; 0c92cf6cd0aac6e28915077426a51da5fa999e3d; db05de02455bd4eb65e0dde1ec7b889236f80413; c720bae7798a3cdd08ccc69fe314e4287cb490ec; c4bf58df77f586cad49194634f42fc42bdb47b09; 7675fe790b74a353cc72bf7744d7f5e2e6d9d94f; 9018c646a6433df21dfc2241b6cb16bba9dfc07e; ce2f70dfe27f47d59c53abe88c56bc4f1027db1b; 49d570a918ef3182c703fe4fc6da6b452c8c1f4a; a714d6a9b4e40ac7d5e7ec3939b90bba06ae033d; 114a7d7bb4bdcd66c8e4cb4346334e00749d441d; 89ed062efaa2b01987812abe268d5ee6b4ce7272; 2fbbe3ea20f929fe2f065aad31c45fe28c229fe3,b26163584b17ba636778ab36b724951dd4243739; 2a5cfe7b3250e0460d880f0466bdc84d1064d40f; 26e730ddaca1e91c67eb23f57bdb2c38c08c4b3f; 0d0171916a86f84a67c3abeffb5411819dbfb649; ff4f3c4b9244ee4d04322cb102b411ab48ccd740; 36c2ad8a4e071b50e5bec8bed5febde979cd4489; e9d0c56609bdaa1c61dce65bf1951a7caa41810d; 23dcf3d63cfca01bd01640cbc2488fdebdd475e8; 07e29e88579d922cdd258a945347b00835268e5a; 2a4ee2ac272798080b791f91bdd8051c5699ab3a; 2e24b8a26f92cab95c0dab3075910a3bedda709a; e20833681253dfe423b30351924b3fcdd85948d6; 4ee9834afa1c015fff64f81a8ede8dc27da95449; e18540adb9cf0520e4c91ef05cf7411eeaf9ae20; 187cbed46eae67df34197fa9fef7889d3391ec56; 089f569dc24f29fd2e9068cb6a43bb34e13f8346; 7e1bd35343dcdc93508c524ab523d371b3171650; e8496cbde8e152fb511bc66f53fd18fe7bfa222a; a1eadc8a6195619ad1e743b83eef35748cf0d93b; 6a2cdcffcd06f1104fdc3d04920f70bc85a73bf7; 834a937721b8ce72b9fdfac9fa0b45129281053c; 912d0fe0f4b60bfb25009674cae519448b09ddb3; b5cffd03da14bbdc1c5f4d630a0cf043b5b6face; a96a1fee948a06d083e9d7bf57480666bd1653f3; 1ca771ac4c33c7da83ab1c0e95a6d792f488ba59; 56c6f8d6cf79aa70bcef7379e5932aec9b27c835; b6fce19d5848e825f43b99e627129e463366acf6; 323130a4dd159a04d1fbf20f30e8bebb40a5e023; 90391f2f9f0238958f11cd66da26a75ff81f2401; 422fdf124a72c1f41bf56c501b882482c00b40d3; b3ea0d98b6921e8e9f564265cb6851209b7f7682; 968031637d3cb8dab017c58c24dbab456ed06c6e; 7551668b9f339a270ae3bc0561d46a682b1436c8; 57ddc179c8adb6f3c36f695bda122a3a9317b49b; 1244cbab72dd6983afda722dbef0b24e3a8b921e; dcb208468a9d53911879d5b3835aaeaa5ef7ee6c; 307e6f12e1689c27b5b2c66b691ac84f1ee52671; aa1c25f099ed94284f9f0425389c4a7fda824e7d; 9d7018f59dd76c86e00942cbc7047e322038130f; 2b307e96bbf808eeeedf63ebaed51e060e49b69c; b94d4b94697c338303bbbf61dfd0aed0eb7e2b01; 276d7c6587d6b7ca5cc97a4f057d0b7f7efd59b7; 5cbc829db94576b95d87b800d50fd4a174db440a; 6250b7872c6d15c43c3d2ff935678dfadfe850b7; 6dec8f7b166e17d8cd9ad171b7496b13a495c3f0; 5b54e5c76afe79a3c3c292ab9757e8dcd138b5ad; 2640233925b941dc3a1b1590923d14ec7370fc00; 19b1e90e58840f1a5b5b562997d0bbcb322d47fc; bb3fe2d7b807e5569a62ea0ebdf7015167e13746; 0cdf771b93155c26db225ee6993a8a0520d23a5b; f65f29f9039d75df2f08d8da7fc860cc13dafb95; 0094ecca2f72d166bc0bd35a9c793ebb32c31ac1; 3d79f72133138e188674bda5c84aa720a0e99c4f; cb7c18e8c05cca206be69132d33b229b3b041f62; 69cc3e8061294cb44da26e95619cd8b3a29171d0; a8b731cf96841d7d508570bbc0c36b3d57ded8bf; 8bb265c0720b6bdbb5fcf14c2dbea15b9b935b8e,Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research : CR,34,

Candida albicans Virulence Genes Induced During Intra-abdominal Candidiasis (IAC) in the Absence of Antifungal Exposure Mediate Echinocandin Resistance,"Background. We developed and validated a mouse model of C. albicans IAC that mimics peritonitis and abscesses (IAA) in humans, and that is amenable to temporalâ€“ spatial transcriptional profiling and virulence studies. Methods. We measured C. albicans SC5314 gene expression by RNA-Seq (RiboPure extraction; Illumina MiSeq) in triplicate during early peritonitis (within 30 minutes of infection), late peritonitis (24 hours) and IAA (48 hours). Differential expression was defined by â‰¥2-fold differences at false discovery rate â‰¤0.01. Results. â‰¥7 million C. albicans reads were detected in each experiment. 67% of C. albicans reads mapped to coding sequences, covering 93% of open reading frames. The 50 C. albicans genes most highly expressed during early peritonitis were associated with pH (including RIM101 and PHR1) and oxidative stress responses, and adhesion/ hyphal growth (e.g., ALS3, HWP1, ECM331, SAP6). The corresponding 50 C. albicans late peritonitis genes were associated with neutrophil/macrophage responses and nutrient acquisition (glyoxylate cycle, fatty acid Î²-oxidation, iron homeostasis). Responses within IAA included DNA damage and iron metabolism, reflecting stress response and nutrient/metal limitation. The top 50 core gene responses for all stages were associated with adhesion, stress response, and glucose transport. Among the most up-regulated genes in late peritonitis and IAA compared with early peritonitis were those involved antifungal drug resistance (CDR family, MDR1, FLU1, and ERG family), although mice were not exposed to antifungals. Null and reconstitution mutants for genes involved in adhesion (ALS3), copper transport (CCC2), DNA (DDI1) and cell wall damage responses (DAP1 homologs), and glycerol biosynthesis (RHR2) were attenuated for virulence in temporal-spatial fashion during peritonitis and IAA, and/or hyper-susceptible to phagocytosis and echinocandins (table). Conclusion. C. albicans relies upon diverse biologic processes to cause peritonitis and IAA. Multiple genes induced in response to stress during IAC mediate virulence, phagocyte, and echinocandin resistance. Therefore, pathogenic strategies used by C. albicans during IAC may lessen responses to echinocandin treatment, even in the absence of drug exposure or FKS mutations.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Cornelius J.

4d99440973f3e2eae2aa86743780bfca0be02ece,Abstract 598: Genetically predicted concentration of circulating proteins and epithelial ovarian cancer risk,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common gynecological cancer, and ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women in the United States. Previous studies have identified several circulating proteins biomarkers for EOC risk, such as CA125 antigen and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). However, previous studies on protein biomarkers for EOC were limited with small sample sizes, and only a few proteins investigated. In this study, we integrated genomics and proteomics data to search for novel circulating protein biomarkers for EOC risk. We constructed study instruments using genetic variants for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for over 1,400 circulating proteins. Beta coefficients and standard errors of the selected pQTL variants in relation to EOC risk were obtained from 25,509 EOC cases and 40,941 controls from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). An inverse-variance weighted method was used to evaluate the association of these genetically predicted protein levels and risk of overall and serous EOC. We identified 35 protein biomarkers, for which their genetically predicted levels were significantly associated with the risk of either overall or serous EOC (false discovery rate Citation Format: Guochong Jia, Xiang Shu, Xiao-Ou Shu, Jirong Long, Qiuyin Cai, Kirsten B.

5a53767d7649472314117b316bd525529dd11977,Distinct degenerative phenotype of articular cartilage from knees with meniscus tear compared to knees with osteoarthritis.,"OBJECTIVE
To compare the transcriptome of articular cartilage from knees with meniscus tears to knees with end-stage osteoarthritis (OA).


DESIGN
Articular cartilage was collected from the non-weight bearing medial intercondylar notch of knees undergoing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM; NÂ =Â 10, 49.7Â Â±Â 10.8 years, 50% females) for isolated medial meniscus tears and knees undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA; NÂ =Â 10, 66.0Â Â±Â 7.6 years, 70% females) due to end-stage OA. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) preparation was subjected to SurePrint G3 human 8Â Ã—Â 60K RNA microarrays to probe differentially expressed transcripts followed by computational exploration of underlying biological processes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed on selected transcripts to validate microarray data.


RESULTS
We observed that 81 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed (45 elevated, 36 repressed) between APM and TKA samples (â‰¥ 2 fold) at a false discovery rate of â‰¤ 0.05. Among these, CFD, CSN1S1, TSPAN11, CSF1R and CD14 were elevated in the TKA group, while CHI3L2, HILPDA, COL3A1, COL27A1 and FGF2 were highly expressed in APM group. A few long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snoRNAs) and antisense RNAs were also differentially expressed between the two groups. Transcripts up-regulated in TKA cartilage were enriched for protein localization and activation, chemical stimulus, immune response, and toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Transcripts up-regulated in APM cartilage were enriched for mesenchymal cell apoptosis, epithelial morphogenesis, canonical glycolysis, extracellular matrix organization, cartilage development, and glucose catabolic process.


CONCLUSIONS
This study suggests that APM and TKA cartilage express distinct sets of OA transcripts. The gene profile in cartilage from TKA knees represents an end-stage OA whereas in APM knees it is clearly earlier in the degenerative process.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Muhammad Farooq Rai"", ids = ""32044050""); list(name = ""Eric Tycksen"", ids = ""5886495""); list(name = ""Liqiang Cai"", ids = ""4065397""); list(name = ""Jennifer T.

0d921e48bdc72ddc87977f1601268940ab181780,Mouse and Human Genetic Analyses Associate Kalirin with Ventral Striatal Activation during Impulsivity and with Alcohol Misuse,"Impulsivity is associated with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders including drug addiction. To investigate genetic associations with impulsivity and initiation of drug taking, we took a two-step approach. First, we identified genes whose expression level in prefrontal cortex, striatum and accumbens were associated with impulsive behavior in the 5-choice serial reaction time task across 10 BXD recombinant inbred (BXD RI) mouse strains and their progenitor C57BL/6J and DBA2/J strains. Behavioral data were correlated with regional gene expression using GeneNetwork (www.genenetwork.org), to identify 44 genes whose probability of association with impulsivity exceeded a false discovery rate of < 0.05. We then interrogated the IMAGEN database of 1423 adolescents for potential associations of SNPs in human homologs of those genes identified in the mouse study, with brain activation during impulsive performance in the Monetary Incentive Delay task, and with novelty seeking scores from the Temperament and Character Inventory, as well as alcohol experience. There was a significant overall association between the human homologs of impulsivity-related genes and percentage of premature responses in the MID task and with fMRI BOLD-response in ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation. In contrast, no significant association was found between the polygenic scores and anterior cingulate cortex activation. Univariate association analyses revealed that the G allele (major) of the intronic SNP rs6438839 in the KALRN gene was significantly associated with increased VS activation. Additionally, the A-allele (minor) of KALRN intronic SNP rs4634050, belonging to the same haplotype block, was associated with increased frequency of binge drinking.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yolanda PeÃ±a-Oliver"", ids = ""1403296718""); list(name = ""Fabiana M.

c29444bddc5dcd8dd8b253a4c2d7cb01171195d6,Progressive approach for SNP calling and haplotype assembly using single molecular sequencing data,"Motivation: Haplotype information is essential to the complete description and interpretation of genomes, genetic diversity and genetic ancestry. The new technologies can provide Single Molecular Sequencing (SMS) data that cover about 90% of positions over chromosomes. However, the SMS data has a higher error rate comparing to 1% error rate for short reads. Thus, it becomes very difficult for SNP calling and haplotype assembly using SMS reads. Most existing technologies do not work properly for the SMS data. Results: In this paper, we develop a progressive approach for SNP calling and haplotype assembly that works very well for the SMS data. Our method can handle more than 200 million nonâ€N bases on Chromosome 1 with millions of reads, more than 100 blocks, each of which contains more than 2 million bases and more than 3K SNP sites on average. Experiment results show that the false discovery rate and false negative rate for our method are 15.7 and 11.0% on NA12878, and 16.5 and 11.0% on NA24385. Moreover, the overall switch errors for our method are 7.26 and 5.21 with average 3378 and 5736 SNP sites per block on NA12878 and NA24385, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that SMS reads alone can generate a high quality solution for both SNP calling and haplotype assembly.

f47ca6892d911e2d491461b52991e5e0535a5afc,Empirical Bayesian approach to testing multiple hypotheses with separate priors for left and right alternatives,"Abstract We consider a multiple hypotheses problem with directional alternatives in a decision theoretic framework. We obtain an empirical Bayes rule subject to a constraint on mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDRâ‰¤Î±) under the semiparametric setting where the distribution of the test statistic is parametric, but the prior distribution is nonparametric. We proposed separate priors for the left tail and right tail alternatives as it may be required for many applications. The proposed Bayes rule is compared through simulation against rules proposed by Benjamini and Yekutieli and Efron. We illustrate the proposed methodology for two sets of data from biological experiments: HIV-transfected cell-line mRNA expression data, and a quantitative trait genome-wide SNP data set. We have developed a user-friendly web-based shiny App for the proposed method which is available through URL https://npseb.shinyapps.io/npseb/.

c2a9d44ff93dc708149023141c80c305204fa5a3,Quantitative analysis of the murine lipid droplet-associated proteome during diet-induced hepatic steatosis.,"Hepatic steatosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs), which are composed of a neutral lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer embedded with many proteins. Although the LD-associated proteome has been investigated in multiple tissues and organisms, the dynamic changes in the murine LD-associated proteome in response to obesity and hepatic steatosis have not been studied. We characterized the hepatic LD-associated proteome of C57BL/6J male mouse livers following high-fat feeding using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification. Of the 1,520 proteins identified with a 5% local false discovery rate, we report a total of 48 proteins that were increased and 52 proteins that were decreased on LDs in response to high-fat feeding. Most notably, ribosomal and endoplasmic reticulum proteins were increased and extracellular and cytosolic proteins were decreased in response to high-fat feeding. Additionally, many proteins involved in fatty acid catabolism or xenobiotic metabolism were enriched in the LD fraction following high-fat feeding. In contrast, proteins involved in glucose metabolism and liver X receptor or retinoid X receptor activation were decreased on LDs of high-fat-fed mice. This study provides insights into unique biological functions of hepatic LDs under normal and steatotic conditions.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Salmaan Ahmed Khan"", ids = ""48394893""); list(name = ""Edith E.

cc3bf32c320e73dc131564c8aa743374d80d3d75,Pilot study of myocardial ischemia-induced metabolomic changes in emergency department patients undergoing stress testing,"BACKGROUND
The heart is a metabolically active organ, and plasma acylcarnitines are associated with long-term risk for myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that myocardial ischemia from cardiac stress testing will produce dynamic changes in acylcarnitine and amino acid levels compared to levels seen in matched control patients with normal stress tests.


METHODS
We analyzed targeted metabolomic profiles in a pilot study of 20 case patients with inducible ischemia on stress testing from an existing prospectively collected repository of 357 consecutive patients presenting with symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in an Emergency Department (ED) observation unit between November 2012 and September 2014. We selected 20 controls matched on age, sex, and body-mass index (BMI). A peripheral blood sample was drawn <1 hour before stress testing and 2 hours after stress testing on each patient. We assayed 60 select acylcarnitines and amino acids by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a Quattro Micro instrument (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Metabolite values were log transformed for skew. We then performed bivariable analysis for stress test outcome and both individual timepoint metabolite concentrations and stress-delta metabolite ratios (T2/T0). False discovery rates (FDR) were calculated for 60 metabolites while controlling for age, sex, and BMI. We built multivariable regularized linear models to predict stress test outcome from metabolomics data at times 0, 2 hours, and log ratio between these two. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate the performance characteristics of the model.


RESULTS
Nine of our 20 case subjects were male. Cases' average age was 55.8, with an average BMI 29.5. Bivariable analysis identified 5 metabolites associated with positive stress tests (FDR < 0.2): alanine, C14:1-OH, C16:1, C18:2, C20:4. The multivariable regularized linear models built on T0 and T2 had Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) between 0.5 and 0.55, however, the log(T2/T0) model yielded 0.625 AUC, with 65% sensitivity and 60% specificity. The top metabolites selected by the model were: Ala, Arg, C12-OH/C10-DC, C14:1-OH, C16:1, C18:2, C18:1, C20:4 and C18:1-DC.


CONCLUSIONS
Stress-delta metabolite analysis of patients undergoing stress testing is feasible. Future studies with a larger sample size are warranted.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander T.

There are two different modes of microbiome differential abundance analysis: the individual-based univariate differential abundance analysis and the group-based multivariate differential abundance analysis. The univariate analysis identifies differentially abundant microbiome taxa subject to multiple correction under certain statistical error measurements such as false discovery rate, which is typically complicated by the high-dimensionality of taxa and complex correlation structure among taxa. The multivariate analysis evaluates the overall shift in the abundance of microbiome composition between two conditions, which provides useful preliminary differential information for the necessity of follow-up validation studies. In this paper, we present a novel Adaptive multivariate two-sample test for Microbiome Differential Analysis (AMDA) to examine whether the composition of a taxa-set are different between two conditions.

faa27a1e659f9136c6e46316b6dd759ca432be01,The DPYSL2 gene connects mTOR and schizophrenia,"We previously reported a schizophrenia-associated polymorphic CT di-nucleotide repeat (DNR) at the 5'-untranslated repeat (UTR) of DPYSL2, which responds to mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling with allelic differences in reporter assays. Now using microarray analysis, we show that the DNR alleles interact differentially with specific proteins, including the mTOR-related protein HuD/ELAVL4. We confirm the differential binding to HuD and other known mTOR effectors by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We edit HEK293 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 to carry the schizophrenia risk variant (13DNR) and observe a significant reduction of the corresponding CRMP2 isoform. These edited cells confirm the response to mTOR inhibitors and show a twofold shortening of the cellular projections. Transcriptome analysis of these modified cells by RNA-seq shows changes in 12.7% of expressed transcripts at a false discovery rate of 0.05. These transcripts are enriched in immunity-related genes, overlap significantly with those modified by the schizophrenia-associated gene, ZNF804A, and have a reverse expression signature from that seen with antipsychotic drugs.

81de5eca7346548fce7d2daf69a08d8bff28664a,Q-GDEMAR: a general method for the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarrays with unbalanced groups.,"Microarray analysis is a powerful tool to simultaneously determine the pattern of transcription of large amounts of genes. For data post-processing distinct computational methods are currently used that, however, lead to different results regarding the genes expressed differentially. Herein, a new methodology for microarray data analysis named Q-GDEMAR is presented. It combines the quantile characterization of the entire distribution together with the Gaussian deconvolution of the central region of the microarray data distribution. Three discriminant variable variants are proposed that allow us to summarize data and compare groups even when their size is strongly unbalanced. In addition, a simple procedure to compute the false discovery rate (FDR) is also presented. The performance of the method is compared with that observed when using LIMMA (Linear Models Microarray) software as reference. In 58 out of 68 cases, Q-GDEMAR showed a higher sensitivity than LIMMA to detect differentially expressed genes (p = 1 Ã— 10(-10)). The proposed method does not produce biased information, detecting genes with high sensitivity equally well at both tails of the distribution (p = 0.7428). Moreover, all detected genes were associated with very low levels of FDR (median value = 0.67%, interquartile range = 0.87%). Q-GDEMAR can be used as a general method for microarray analysis, but is particularly indicated when the conditions to be compared are unbalanced. The superior performance of Q-GEDEMAR is the consequence of its higher discriminative power and, the fact that it yields a univocal correspondence between the p-values and the values of the discriminating variable. Q-GDEMAR was tested only using Affymetrix microarrays. However, given that it operates after the step of data standardization, it can be used with the same quality features on any of the available mono- or dual-channel microarray platforms.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel V.

f45a0cb6d1b7a941dee77f7811194fb8f9fdf179,Dependencies of the negative BOLD signal in primary somatosensory cortex on stimulation intensity and duration,"Introduction Unilateral stimulation of the somatosensory system induces activation of neurons in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) that is accompanied by an increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Studies report an additional negative BOLD signal in the ipsilateral SI during mechanical or electrical stimulation [1, 2]. As declines in BOLD signal have been shown to be associated with decreases in neuronal activity [3], this indicates inhibition of the ipsilateral SI. Since it is not clear which representations of the body are affected, we show here that during high intensity stimulation of the somatosensory system another, spatially extensive negative BOLD signal in the parietal and occipital cortex forms that has not been mentioned before. These results seem to indicate inhibition of the whole sensory map of the body, implying an increase of sensory thresholds. Low intensity stimulation in contrast results in short term adaptation of the contralateral activity in SI that causes the BOLD signal to change from positive to negative with prolonged stimulation. Methods 8 healthy subjects (2 female, 6 male, average age: 29) took part in this study, which was approved by the local ethics committee. Protocol/ Paradigm: Electrical stimuli were applied through ring electrodes (anode proximal, distance to cathode ~1 cm) to the left index finger as single monophasic square-wave current pulses (pulse duration 0.2 ms) in blocks of 21 s or 3 s, alternating with 21 s of rest. 5 and 8 number of blocks and two different frequencies (2 and 60 Hertz) were used. Total length of paradigms were 7, 13 and 14 min. Stimulation intensity was uncomfortable but below pain threshold and determined by method of limits and forced choice. MR Imaging: MR imaging was performed in a 3.0 T Philips Intera Achieva scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using an eight-element phasedarray receive head coil. Anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D turbo field echo sequence (170 sagittal slices 1 mm thickness; in-plane resolution 1x1 mm; repetition time 9.9 s; echo time 4.6 ms; flip angle 8 ). Functional imaging utilized a gradient echo EPI sequence (22 slices 4.0 mm thickness; slice gap 0.1 mm; field of view 230x230 mm; in-plane acquired resolution 2.9x2.9 mm; repetition time 3.0 s; echo time 35 ms; flip angle 90 ; SENSE factor 1). Analysis: Data was analysed using Brain Voyager QX. Slice time correction, 3d motion correction and temporal high pass filtering were applied, as well as spatial smoothing (3d Gaussian, FWHM 4mm). Functional datasets were co-registered to the anatomical datasets and transformed into Talairach space. They were further analysed using the general linear model. Activated voxels were determined requiring a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of less than 0.02. Regions of interest in SI for left index finger (Brodmann area 3) were determined anatomically.

We hypothesized that a broad panel of inflammatory biomarkers and single nucleotide polymorphisms in inflammatory genes is associated with vascular stiffness. We assessed 12 circulating inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 [mass and activity], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, myeloperoxidase, CD40 ligand, osteoprotegerin, P-selectin, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-II) in relation to tonometry variables (central pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, forward pressure wave, reflected pressure wave, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index) measured in 2409 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age: 60 years; 55% women; 13% ethnic/racial minorities). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (n=2195) in 240 inflammatory candidate genes were related to tonometry measures in 1036 white individuals. In multivariable analyses, biomarkers explained <1% of any tonometry measure variance. Applying backward elimination, markers related to tonometry (P<0.01) were as follows: tumor necrosis factor receptor-II (inversely) with mean arterial pressure; C-reactive protein (positively) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (inversely) with reflected pressure wave; and interleukin-6 and osteoprotegerin (positively) with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. In genetic association analyses, lowest P values (false discovery rate <0.50) were observed for rs10509561 (FAS), P=6.6x10(-5) for central pulse pressure and rs11559271 (ITGB2), P=1.1x10(-4) for mean arterial pressure. These data demonstrate that, in a community-based sample, circulating inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor receptor-II (mean arterial pressure), C-reactive protein, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 activity (reflected pressure wave), interleukin-6, and osteoprotegerin (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity) were significantly but modestly associated with measures of arterial stiffness and wave reflection. Additional studies are needed to determine whether variation in inflammatory marker genes is associated with tonometry measures.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Renate B.

9b0588b0489bff9f4d2bb4b4e0511354df5ed3ca,Controlling the proportion of false positive (PFP) in a multiple test genome scan for marker-QTL linkage.,"INTRODUCTION When heritability analysis shows that QTL are segregating in the population, the large number of markers employed ensures that an appreciable proportion is in linkage to segregating QTL. The challenge is to identify the markers in linkage, while controlling Type I error in this â€œmultiple testâ€ situation. Previous attempts have been based on controlling the overall genomewise Type I error (GWER) (Lander and Kruglyak, 1995), or the False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Weller et al., 1998). The GWER approach results in a drastic reduction in experimental power, while the FDR approach is theoretically inappropriate (Zaykin et al., 2000). Combining previous studies (Southey and Fernando, 1998 ; Mosig et al., 2001) we here present an approach based on controlling the proportion of false positives (PFP), which avoids the limitations of both GWER and FDR. The PFP is derived from the posterior Type I error rate (PER) long used in human linkage studies (Morton, 1955 ; Ott, 1991).",2002,Biology,"list(name = ""Rohan L.

14d06f93c522607cf5326ae3bf2c5d52f5cdef79,Comprehensive genome-wide proteomic analysis of human placental tissue for the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project.,"As a starting point of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP), we established strategies of genome-wide proteomic analysis, including protein identification, quantitation of disease-specific proteins, and assessment of post-translational modifications, using paired human placental tissues from healthy and preeclampsia patients. This analysis resulted in identification of 4239 unique proteins with high confidence (two or more unique peptides with a false discovery rate less than 1%), covering 21% of approximately 20, 059 (Ensembl v69, Oct 2012) human proteins, among which 28 proteins exhibited differentially expressed preeclampsia-specific proteins. When these proteins are assigned to all human chromosomes, the pattern of the newly identified placental protein population is proportional to that of the gene count distribution of each chromosome. We also identified 219 unique N-linked glycopeptides, 592 unique phosphopeptides, and 66 chromosome 13-specific proteins. In particular, protein evidence of 14 genes previously known to be specifically up-regulated in human placenta was verified by mass spectrometry. With respect to the functional implication of these proteins, 38 proteins were found to be involved in regulatory factor biosynthesis or the immune system in the placenta, but the molecular mechanism of these proteins during pregnancy warrants further investigation. As far as we know, this work produced the highest number of proteins identified in the placenta and will be useful for annotating and mapping all proteins encoded in the human genome.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hyoung-Joo Lee"", ids = ""40602760""); list(name = ""Seul-Ki Jeong"", ids = ""3141272""); list(name = ""Keun Na"", ids = ""5172612""); list(name = ""Min Jung Lee"", ids = ""144061951""); list(name = ""Sun Hee Lee"", ids = ""2606180""); list(name = ""Jong-Sun Lim"", ids = ""4420218""); list(name = ""Hyun-Jeong Cha"", ids = ""12884317""); list(name = ""Jin-Young Cho"", ids = ""2501988""); list(name = ""Ja-Young Kwon"", ids = ""145817323""); list(name = ""Hoguen Kim"", ids = ""82609239""); list(name = ""Si Young Song"", ids = ""144871603""); list(name = ""Jong Shin Yoo"", ids = ""4317193""); list(name = ""Young Mok Park"", ids = ""30455726""); list(name = ""Hail Kim"", ids = ""8186143""); list(name = ""William Hancock"", ids = ""2878867""); list(name = ""Young-Ki Paik"", ids = ""145822622"")",4d20ec9859aab96a2b828ef6964b0e7bc4c6b5c6; 9792f6a462d8e28bb3fb719343301dcde0247511; fc0701d12d5fed84125026b070612b8261f7c5ca; 19e285130ee65766894a353f35cdcee7ae2dc1fb; eb77a698a598a69276dbd79cd6f0b2457533f42b; af82cce2e47838e03e7a17cff5fc1eb423f7f425; 00d75026bf7f3b726a4b49aeb723f3afb97e9e64; 59c9061ca7d2da03b5f0938e99ad3418caaf240c; a8e26ca9c10fa210bb7b68611664c9e76f11c0ae; 74f770a894f4675c004e2844a578c6689effde2f; a301902d7fff0899b661c75349274066b1f8c798; 228417d638c5e72a721c22caf069bd7c5cb7707d; 94ee4ffb9ff51f3a36a5585d66b6e0f73a28b59e; d81ef4da55fb9fdf8138434290d062e7e89e7433; 55072d23c7b9f6d69bd3b2fd33d6ae79545d9424; aa23316e413958d8f9bf237b4a1b3769fc011fd9,,Journal of proteome research,12 6,"

afb5499c040b1dfa064171f6c552ba8af3cff78e,Spatial source phase: A new feature for identifying spatial differences based on complex-valued resting-state fMRI data.,"Spatial source phase, the phase information of spatial maps extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data by data-driven methods such as independent component analysis (ICA), has rarely been studied. While the observed phase has been shown to convey unique brain information, the role of spatial source phase in representing the intrinsic activity of the brain is yet not clear. This study explores the spatial source phase for identifying spatial differences between patients with schizophrenia (SZs) and healthy controls (HCs) using complex-valued resting-state fMRI data from 82 individuals. ICA is first applied to preprocess fMRI data, and post-ICA phase de-ambiguity and denoising are then performed. The ability of spatial source phase to characterize spatial differences is examined by the homogeneity of variance test (voxel-wise F-test) with false discovery rate correction. Resampling techniques are performed to ensure that the observations are significant and reliable. We focus on two components of interest widely used in analyzing SZs, including the default mode network (DMN) and auditory cortex. Results show that the spatial source phase exhibits more significant variance changes and higher sensitivity to the spatial differences between SZs and HCs in the anterior areas of DMN and the left auditory cortex, compared to the magnitude of spatial activations. Our findings show that the spatial source phase can potentially serve as a new brain imaging biomarker and provide a novel perspective on differences in SZs compared to HCs, consistent with but extending previous work showing increased variability in patient data.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yue Qiu"", ids = ""145329682""); list(name = ""Qiu-Hua Lin"", ids = ""2844360""); list(name = ""Li-Dan Kuang"", ids = ""1843747""); list(name = ""Xiao-Feng Gong"", ids = ""46810105""); list(name = ""Fengyu Cong"", ids = ""1766771""); list(name = ""Yu-ping Wang"", ids = ""2679901""); list(name = ""Vince D.

Cerebrovascular redistribution is common in fetal CHD but of unclear significance. We aimed to determine if prenatal hemodynamics assessed by fetal echocardiogram (FE) predict postnatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities and microstructural organization by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Term infants with complex CHD had prospective 3T pre & post-op brain MRI to assess cortical/subcortical abnormalities & injury. DTI (42 directions) was segmented (90 regions) with graph metrics of brain organization: modularity, integration (efficiency), and segregation (clustering). First FE data included ascending aorta diameter (AoD), retrograde aortic arch flow (rAo), pulsatility index (PI) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA), and calculation of gestational age z-scores & cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) = MCA-PI Ã— UA-PI.

Furthermore, the questions of scientific interest often relate to so-called regions of interest constituted by clusters in the sample space. We are first considered with spatial models and describe false discovery rate-controlling multiple tests for continuous families of hypotheses and for grouped systems of hypotheses. Then, we show how random field theory can be utilized to construct family-wise error rate-controlling simultaneous test procedures which account for the topological structure of the brain. Finally, multivariate time series models are presented which are capable of modeling both the spatial and the dynamic components of the signals in the data.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Thorsten Dickhaus"", ids = ""2128904"")",,,,,155-166

However, whether the mean FC is increased, decreased or unchanged in aMCI patients compared to normal controls remains unclear. Two factors might lead to inconsistent results: the determination of regions of interest and the reliability of the FC. We explored differences in FC and the degree centrality (Dc) constructed by the bootstrap method, between and within networks (default-mode network (DN), frontoparietal control network (CN), dorsal attention network (AN)), and resulting from a hierarchical-clustering algorithm. The mean FC within the DN and CN was significantly increased (P < 0.05, uncorrected) in patients. Significant increases (P < 0.05, uncorrected) in the mean FC were found in patients between DN and CN and between DN and AN. Five pairs of FC (false discovery rate corrected) and the Dc of six regions (Bonferroni corrected) displayed a significant increase in patients. Lower cognitive ability was significantly associated with a greater increase in the Dc of the left superior temporal sulcus. Our results demonstrate that the early dysfunctions in aMCI disease are mainly compensatory impairments.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiali Liang"", ids = ""1605986097""); list(name = ""Yunfei Li"", ids = ""23025349""); list(name = ""Hao Liu"", ids = ""50819394""); list(name = ""Sisi Zhang"", ids = ""1605734328""); list(name = ""Meimei Wang"", ids = ""34342982""); list(name = ""Yonghua Chu"", ids = ""144362286""); list(name = ""Jian-ping Ye"", ids = ""7173839""); list(name = ""Qian Xi"", ids = ""1516881884""); list(name = ""Xiao-hu Zhao"", ids = ""2029494"")",,7c52e6041ba560859ab13e3cca4b924d2bbc478c; c03861d90fd46aa967d537704fc151b1495745b1; 25c05f41ab4d197d922fa1f03e2a526fe0450cf1; 2f689cfa8ce23efa836ca0e9a5da2449bb06e085; ad17a233a8ed7677c0dc4b70366930fa8b366402; 90f4a42fdd3fc61ad2f6927003bd29f427fc4f7a; cb1dc33a1c6f9e00a1445a7d485fcd5a6f2849f4; 4b61e7ba7c68885defa6a9351c3a3ba1eadd26cf; b6b5e13a5e03147fa970daf67e1c8e010c5ae80c; fbe0aeb6d1aaca06c84c985ce63b7c061569dd99; 24f3e29d9feab95e78f3f47364c4edbae34adfd2; 7b2c4cce0fbb0159f9a26cbe03a66c985a993b7b; 3a576e6d3d0fc82bb789e2895521f19b790c0837; ca7fc07a74b5a70b262c4b660e2337d749723158; 2155fbb17cad3ffdd53fa948a786e4b24d818843; 4c87a93ed4305854258a7bf54e8575427dc81105; ddf92988dc9afe3017fa6f3c134daeecb0c76b41; 490936fa3ab322d8f7a19dda94d853c7ab43ad99; d360a0578be230da7913a2b1d8bbe37357bce6aa; 20b9c31a396c660cde3d48e72b9ec87f4cf337fc; 0b0d195c2524538c1338a823a2765af478c113ca; b649c288a1d462fa8989a00f0e3586c355cae350; 07309a332f59ae191f86badc9ea20d22b2cf0db8; 2e224e4dfd846b73e4f8bd6486cd648cef8c2b9c; 6c64889a707a15702f0abb047be5cd14d8a3dfb4; 37d2d04f8c09da1f0cf8434a38a51841b5b703bf; 389d583c9c76f1b414c44dda8ff3f9f0a23bd05e; e4eb2fae07d520f3ff45ca89dbbf3aca97494a0b; 165fd770b8893f8511852d44f4d4ac7241eebeeb; 26258f7b71d110b6a995dac9ba2648f159b721a4; b8c12a7a097bbc812680525b97bee9d6430d6446; 48265726215736f7dd7ceccacac488422032397c; f954f16b2c0e3364d40759309ab22932a6242b2f; a03a50c3ce0c2de646ff532f15d2ecacc29abf73; c67076dd3e2ea2e5f387da3ed3a60458acfd3b81; 89b09ee5a5ac2b922dd1fde75b9fba267307b286; a55df99552d6093b6150fe2ca79d017644b73935; 83ebd338a60dd41030fde5015a3ecc8ca7c32449; 3421bbc6cf9e02908cbed1c848749861ad93b25a; abf33144e3c6ae38b09bb1d3991ca507f38a33ae; 62aa97afdfc75325dcad1698599e7b0225e18944; 641fbec56ec55c19e724aff4ebf55af864b3c656; b9666dfce48ea18ef9676297dcc6cb62a85fefde; 01fef3fe5c1926a76efb2680e86bcd0e834d18f7; a197305fd066bb1291ebdf2cb8498408031683e9; 7371299be636d99b108594d0af73a1df8060062c; 0fca2db9b7bbb31a05b25dad82ae8aa175b5b2ff; 291c9d66cf886ed27d89dc03d42a4612b66ab007; c5bd12811ec98818f45aafc131ffa45859c11d15; 775c2d90f3198ae255ce11714b21a45f0775991c,Aging (Albany NY),12,5907 - 5919
0bf4b13de7023373d23fa3e70d82b9c12d66548f,Kynurenine Pathway Metabolites in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BACKGROUND
Metabolites of tryptophan, produced via the kynurenine pathway (kynurenines), have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in small cohorts with conflicting results.


OBJECTIVE
To compare differences in plasma kynurenine levels between AD and controls and identify potential associations with cognition.


METHODS
The study included 65 histopathologically-confirmed AD patients and 65 cognitively-screened controls from the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) cohort. Cognition was assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CamCog). Tryptophan, kynurenines, neopterin, and vitamin B6 forms were measured in plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Non-parametric statistics, logistic regression and standardized robust regressions were applied with a false discovery rate of 0.05.


RESULTS
Tryptophan, xanthurenic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid were lower in AD (Odds ratios (ORs) 0.24 -0.47; p-values <0.001 -0.01). Pyridoxal 5'phosphate did not differ between AD and controls. Kynurenine, anthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, and markers of immune activation (neopterin, kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, and the PAr index (Pyridoxic acid/(Pyridoxal 5'phosphate + Pyridoxal)) increased with age (Î² 0.31 -0.51; p-values <0.001 -0.006). Xanthurenic acid decreased with age (Î²: -0.42, pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Elderly AD patients with high quinolinic acid performed worse on the CamCog test, indicated by a significant age*quinolinic acid interaction (Î² 0.21, pâ€Š<â€Š0.001).


CONCLUSION
Plasma concentrations of several kynurenines were lower in patients with AD compared to controls. Low xanthurenic acid occurred in both AD and with aging. Inflammation-related markers were associated with age, but not AD. However, elevated QA was associated with poor cognition in older AD patients.",2017,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Lasse Melvaer Giil"", ids = ""14743332""); list(name = ""Ã\230ivind Midttun"", ids = ""4356535""); list(name = ""Helga Refsum"", ids = ""31563948""); list(name = ""Arve Ulvik"", ids = ""4373317""); list(name = ""Rajiv Advani"", ids = ""50254821""); list(name = ""Adrian David Smith"", ids = ""47450606""); list(name = ""Per Magne Ueland"", ids = ""74492882"")",28255e065fe07f435078c5b34837b8e6e20e540b; 5e7821e43a3ccd679b4b7edb69c3bd7bff2e6ed9; e50503ba27137c54ae8cde5c505435cc2dea0dc5; a18979b95ef2b6fc4e3315f8ad11e26a08524694; e57d21b4fcb8ff5f1276bb5a54d0f86e528c9ce0; 14007c7b691d64e814a285f4c2b6486abc7d7c59; 73ff3ae200d9328193cdc8d3fa55e07550eaf731; ff33a4cb610d03b03d74d333e48a7a9204b5dcbf; 4a27e86331c63cb46562d11411b7ddc9f203e421; c0336feab4a9fff4f0e0be374b91fbc8c1fa530a; 61bde9d496a53d9238a27a424c5981be1f478b5c; 70cb56ec098399a4026f53abadc4901674099c4c; 77290db39fe5e1cc19fd754d9634d50792b46c52; 09c86d9f87bc69d7aabda0067634d1df0ec2a63d; b6c326953a7b49b3bf6058da9dc31c3b51eaa50b; 7e7c24600904ac08d5871978370935e363d8b8a2; c60a61bc42d2662b6d44a1d28573ab63013fe426; ad804ae9f00a5e6e4f480ec8b525c0464aff039e; db59d18f641894591bd1d1aee8db175fe0ea91c6,,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,60 2,"

7a6cdbe6dde07435262cb105a7cd6a012b669118,Proteomics/phosphoproteomics of left ventricular biopsies from patients with surgical coronary revascularization and pigs with coronary occlusion/reperfusion: remote ischemic preconditioning,"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) by repeated brief cycles of limb ischemia/reperfusion reduces myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. In left ventricular (LV) biopsies from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), only the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 was associated with RIPCâ€™s cardioprotection. We have now used an unbiased, non-hypothesis-driven proteomics and phosphoproteomics approach to analyze LV biopsies from patients undergoing CABG and from pigs undergoing coronary occlusion/reperfusion without (sham) and with RIPC. False discovery rate-based statistics identified a higher prostaglandin reductase 2 expression at early reperfusion with RIPC than with sham in patients. In pigs, the phosphorylation of 116 proteins was different between baseline and early reperfusion with RIPC and/or with sham. The identified proteins were not identical for patients and pigs, but in-silico pathway analysis of proteins with â‰¥2-fold higher expression/phosphorylation at early reperfusion with RIPC in comparison to sham revealed a relation to mitochondria and cytoskeleton in both species.

4b7270f34f1d956ad2a3506d7a2d5fe52bcd4746,A hybrid classification model for prediction of academic performance of students: a big data application,"Predicting the educational performance of students turns into more complex aspect due to the vast data volume in the database. The conventional systems have failed to analyze and monitor the progress of the student; often the promising performance is not being addressed. It is due to inappropriate method selection and investigation lagging. This paper intends to predict the educational performance of students based on socio-demographic information. It introduces a performance prediction architecture that includes two modules. One module is to handle the big data via MapReduce framework (incorporates the concept of principle component analysis), whereas the second module is an intelligent module that predicts the performance of the students using data processing stages. For this, this paper introduces a new hybrid classifier, which hybridizes the deep belief network and support vector machine. The output from the proposed classifier gives an accurate prediction of student performance. The performance of the proposed prediction model is compared over other conventional methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, negative predictive value, F1-score Matthews correlation coefficient, false positive rate, false negative rate and false discovery rate, and proven the superiority of proposed prediction model.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Deepali R Vora"", ids = ""70303173""); list(name = ""Kamatchi Rajamani"", ids = ""1410678691"")",,,Evolutionary Intelligence,,1-14
b93af440a91ee7b8f0437db304ea7ed811ab1704,9b.09: Identification of Markers Predictive for Malignant Behavior of Pheochromocytomas and Paragangliomas.,"OBJECTIVE
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are relatively rare and mostly benign tumours. Approximately 10% of PPGL are malignant, as defined by the presence of metastases, i.e chromaffin tissue at a location that usually does not contain chromaffin cells. However, up to 35% of tumours in patients carrying an SDHB mutation appears to be malignant. Nowadays, no reliable marker allows to predict whether a PPGL is, or will become malignant. In addition, there are no curative treatments if metastases occur. The aim of the present study was to dentify genetic markers allowing to distinguish benign from malignant tumours.


DESIGN AND METHOD
An mRNA expression array was performed on benign and malignant PPGL. The genes showing a different expression between the benign and malignant tumours were selected to be confirmed and validated by qRT-PCR. Finally, the remaining genes were stained by immunohistochemistry on Tissue MicroArray including a large series of PPGL.


RESULTS
Forty benign and 12 malignant PPGL were investigated for differences in mRNA expression with Affymetrix arrays. Expression data were normalized according to Affymetrix recommendations. Then, using Pomelo II (http://pomelo2.bioinfo.cnio.es/), a Limma t-test was performed, to assess which genes were differentially expressed between benign and malignant PPGL. First, a non-clustered analysis was performed and 10 genes with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) below 0.05 and a relative overexpression ratio of at least 4 were found, including Interleukin 13 Receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2) and Monooxygenase DBH-like 1 (MOXD1). Secondly, a supervised cluster analysis was performed (based on HIF target genes), resulting in 2 groups, which were both investigated for differences in mRNA expression between benign and malignant tumours. Five genes showed an FDR below 0.01 and were overexpressed in malignant tumours with a ratio higher than 4, including Contactin 4 (CNTN4), Iroquois Homeobox 3 (IRX3), and Sulfatase 2 (SULF2). These genes were further investigated using qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry on Tissue Micro Array including 91 benign and 12 malignant PPGL.


CONCLUSIONS
Significant overexpression of Contactin 4 was shown in malignant compared to benign tumours, and may therefore contribute to distinguish malignant from benign PPGL.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucie Evenepoel"", ids = ""4220034""); list(name = ""Francien H van Nederveen"", ids = ""91971177""); list(name = ""Lindsey Oudijk"", ids = ""5560798""); list(name = ""Thomas G.

MATERIAL AND METHODS MRI scans were performed on 12 depressive patients before and after 8 courses of ECT and compared with those of 15 normal controls. Data were analyzed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using SPM8 software. Functional MRI (fMRI) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses were used to assess the functional changes after ECT. RESULTS Grey matter volumes were smaller in the right cingulate gyrus of depressive patients before ECT compared with normal controls. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, post-ECT grey matter volumes were increased in bilateral amygdala and hippocampus compared with pre-ECT. Resting-state ReHo maps showed significant differences in brain activity pre- and post-ECT. Compared with healthy controls, MDD patients treated with 8 courses of ECT showed higher ReHo values in the bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral parietal lobe, and right caudate nucleus. Decreased ReHo values were observed in the right medial temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, and left anterior cerebellar lobe. CONCLUSIONS Results suggested that there were both structural and functional differences between the brains of MDD patients and healthy controls. After ECT, both structural and functional changes occurred, but without complete recovery to normal.

Echo-planar-imaging diffusion-weighted MR images (b-valuesâ€‰=â€‰0, 1000, and 2000 with 30 diffusion gradient directions) were acquired on a 3T scanner.


ASSESSMENT
Maps for mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD) and kurtosis (MK, AK, and RK), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated in the tumor, perilesional white matter, and contralateral normal-appearing white matter regions.


STATISTICAL TESTING
General linear models (GLM), Cohen's d for effect size estimates, false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple corrections, Cochran Q-test.


RESULTS
Pairwise differences were observed for all diffusion and kurtosis measures between the studied regions (FDR Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), except an FA map that failed to show significant differences between the lesion and perilesional white matter (FDR Pâ€‰=â€‰0.373). Effect size analysis showed that kurtosis metrics were found to be 18.8% (RK, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.144) to 29.1% (AK, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) more sensitive in discriminating perilesional regions from the lesion than corresponding diffusion metrics, whereas AK provided a 25.0% (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) increase in sensitivity in discriminating perilesional and contralateral white matter. RK was found to be the most sensitive to contralateral white matter differences between low-grade gliomas and controls, with MK and RK providing a significantly greater sensitivity of 587.2% (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and 320.7% (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) than MD and RD, respectively.


DATA CONCLUSION
Kurtosis maps showed increased sensitivity, as compared to counterpart diffusion maps, for evaluation of microstructural changes in gliomas with a 3-6-fold increment in assessing changes in contralateral white matter.

Inverse comorbidity is disease occurring at lower rates than expected among persons with a given index disease. The objective was to identify inverse comorbidity in MS.


METHODS
We performed a combined case-control and cohort study in a total nationwide cohort of cases with clinical onset of MS 1980-2005. We randomly matched each MS-case with five population controls. Comorbidity data were obtained from multiple, independent nationwide registries. Cases and controls were followed from January 1977 to the index date, and from the index date through December 2012. We controlled for false discovery rate and investigated each of eight pre-specified comorbidity categories: psychiatric, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, lung, and autoimmune comorbidities, diabetes, cancer, and Parkinson's disease.


RESULTS
A total of 8947 MS-cases and 44,735 controls were eligible for inclusion. We found no inverse associations with MS before the index date. After the index date, we found a decreased occurrence of chronic lung disease (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, p<0.00025)) and overall cancer (HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.81-0.95, p=0.0005)) among MS-cases.

e946244086e8ddcb83945b8f078be0546b7332bc,Overweight and obesity status in pregnant women are related to intestinal microbiota and serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles.,"BACKGROUND
Overweight and obesity may predispose women to clinical complications during their pregnancy. We hypothesize that a higher degree of overweight status is related to a range of aberrations in biomarkers already in early pregnancy. Our objective was to investigate whether intestinal microbiota, serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles differ in relation to the degree of overweight status in pregnant women.


METHODS
This study investigated 52 overweight and 47 obese pregnant women in early pregnancy. Fecal samples were analyzed for intestinal microbiota composition by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and Qiime pipeline. Circulating serum metabolites, including lipids, amino acids and GlycA, a marker of low-grade inflammation, were analyzed by NMR metabolomics and hsCRP was quantified by immunoassay. Serum zonulin levels were analyzed to depict intestinal permeability by Zonulin ELISA kit and LPS activity for endotoxemia by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. The analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate controlling.


RESULTS
The relative abundance of bacterial family Prevotellaceae (adjusted PÂ =Â 0.19) and markers of low-grade inflammation, hsCRP (PÂ =Â 0.0015) and GlycA (PÂ <Â 0.001) and three branched chain amino acids (isoleucine, adjusted PÂ =Â 0.024; leucine, adjusted PÂ =Â 0.026; valine, adjusted PÂ =Â 0.10) and one aromatic amino acid (phenylalanine, adjusted PÂ =Â 0.050) and concentrations of several VLDL particles and lipid measures in several VLDL particles were higher in obese pregnant women compared to their overweight pregnant counterparts (adjusted PÂ <Â 0.12). In contrast, lipid measures in a few HDL particles and many fatty acids were lower in obese compared to overweight pregnant women (adjusted PÂ <Â 0.12).


CONCLUSIONS
The detected alterations in intestinal microbiota and metabolic and inflammatory profiles related to obesity status may offer new alternative tools to supplement standard clinical measures to predict the risk for metabolic alterations during the early phase of pregnancy.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Noora Houttu"", ids = ""26388474""); list(name = ""Kati Mokkala"", ids = ""10219697""); list(name = ""Kirsi Laitinen"", ids = ""3724282"")",c9d15df5f764b62be9c97c365088212032886a1c; 18a797a2825de0df0e7ef932d27bf5451faa55d3; 541ac23c1cbdeec2a9c984057d9cffec9b09c2c1; a0875b1fe97069b51672da9d9056dbd7d57eb5dd; bf23590b324636cc4a240b579878a19c43b49cd4; 16495a06934f03c79b7bc8ecb941d0eceac513ad; 5364946c137cdb5a72c0fdc21d2eb91cd8a50ae6; 92dd4b0dd818a3bf39eb7aa6ae61184871effc1a,,Clinical nutrition,37 6 Pt A,"

56fbea18bb0f1d0a5fd014c0ba0aa1baf6d62f50,Epigenome-Wide Assessment of DNA Methylation in the Placenta and Arsenic Exposure in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (USA),"BACKGROUND
Arsenic is one of the most commonly encountered environmental toxicants, and research from model systems has suggested that one mode of its toxic activity may be through alterations in DNA methylation. In utero exposure to arsenic can affect fetal, newborn, and infant health, resulting in a range of phenotypic outcomes.


OBJECTIVES
This study examined variation in placental DNA methylation and its relationship to arsenic exposure in 343 individuals enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study.


METHODS
Linear regression models using a reference-free correction to account for cellular composition were employed to determine CpG loci affected by arsenic levels.


RESULTS
Total arsenic measured in maternal urine during the second trimester was not associated with methylation in the placenta, whereas arsenic levels quantified through maternal toenail collected at birth were associated with methylation at a single CpG locus (p = 4.1 Ã— 10-8). Placenta arsenic levels were associated with 163 differentially methylated loci (false discovery rate < 0.05), with 11 probes within the LYRM2 gene reaching genome-wide significance (p < 10-8). Measurement of LYRM2 mRNA levels indicated that methylation was weakly to moderately correlated with expression (r = 0.15, p < 0.06). In addition, we identified pathways suggesting changes in placental cell subpopulation proportions associated with arsenic exposure.


CONCLUSIONS
These data demonstrate the potential for arsenic, even at levels commonly experienced in a U.S. population, to have effects on the DNA methylation status of specific genes in the placenta and thus supports a potentially novel mechanism for arsenic to affect long-term children's health.

Employing closely related inbred mouse substrains can facilitate gene mapping of nociceptive behaviors in preclinical pain models. We previously reported enhanced sensitivity to acute thermal nociception in C57BL/6J (B6J) versus C57BL/6N (B6N) substrains. Here, we expanded on nociceptive phenotypes and observed an increase in formalin-induced inflammatory nociceptive behaviors and paw diameter in B6J versus B6N mice (Charles River Laboratories). No strain differences were observed in mechanical or thermal hypersensitivity or in edema following the Complete Freundâ€™s Adjuvant model of inflammatory pain, indicating specificity in the inflammatory nociceptive stimulus. In the chronic constrictive nerve injury, a model of neuropathic pain, no strain differences were observed in baseline mechanical threshold or in mechanical hypersensitivity up to one month post-chronic constrictive nerve injury. We replicated the enhanced thermal nociception in the 52.5Â°C hot plate test in B6J versus B6N mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Using a B6Jâ€‰Ã—â€‰B6N-F2 cross (Nâ€‰=â€‰164), we mapped a major quantitative trait locus underlying hot plate sensitivity to chromosome 7 that peaked at 26â€‰Mb (log of the odds [LOD]â€‰=â€‰3.81, pâ€‰<â€‰0.01; 8.74 Mb-36.50â€‰Mb) that was more pronounced in males. Genes containing expression quantitative trait loci associated with the peak nociceptive marker that are implicated in pain and inflammation include Ryr1, Cyp2a5, Pou2f2, Clip3, Sirt2, Actn4, and Ltbp4 (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Future studies involving positional cloning and gene editing will determine the quantitative trait gene(s) and potential pleiotropy of this locus across pain modalities.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Camron D.

7cb96262fb9ee23911620b30f05ef771029de109,Discovering Statistically Significant Periodic Gene Expression,"One frequent application of microarray experiments is in the study of monitoring gene activities in a cell during cell cycle or cell division. High throughput gene expression time series data are produced from such microarray experiments. A new computational and statistical challenge for analyzing such gene expression time course data, resulting from cell cycle microarray experiments, is to discover genes that are statistically significantly periodically expressed during the cell cycle. Such a challenge occurs due to the large number of genes that are simultaneously measured, a moderate to small number of measurements per gene taken at different time points and high levels of non-normal random noises inherited in the data. Computational and statistical approaches to discovery and validation of periodic patterns of gene expression are, however, very limited. A good method of analysis should be able to search for significant periodic genes with a controlled family-wise error (FWE) rate or controlled false discovery rate (FDR) and any other variations of FDR, when all gene expression profiles are compared simultaneously. In this review paper, a brief summary of currently used methods in searching for periodic genes will be given. In particular, two methods will be surveyed in details. The first one is a novel statistical inference approach, the C & G Procedure that can be used to effectively detect statistically significantly periodically expressed genes when the gene expression is measured on evenly spaced time points. The second one is the Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis, which can be used to discover periodic genes when the gene profiles are not measured on evenly spaced time points or when there are missing values in the profiles. The ultimate goal of this review paper is to give an expository of the two surveyed methods to researchers in related fields. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors.

Methods: We included participants â‰¥50 years of age from the FHS (Framingham Heart Study) Offspring and Third Generation cohorts, who had 85 fasting plasma proteins measured using Luminex xMAP platform. Hazard ratios (per 1 SD increment of rank-normalized biomarker [hazard ratio]) and 95% CIs for incident AF were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, height, weight, current smoking, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease, prevalent myocardial infarction, and prevalent heart failure. We used the false discovery rate to account for multiple testing. Results: The study sample comprised 3378 participants (54% women) with mean (SD) age of 61.5 (8.4) years. In total, 401 developed AF over a mean follow-up of 12.3Â±3.8 years. We observed lower hazard of incident AF associated with higher mean levels of IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1; hazard ratio per 1 SD increment in protein level, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76â€“0.93]), and higher hazard of incident AF associated with higher mean levels of both IGFBP1 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1; hazard ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.1â€“1.39]) and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; hazard ratio, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.52â€“1.96]). Conclusions: Decreased levels of IGF1 and increased levels of IGFBP1 and NT-proBNP were associated with higher risk of incident AF.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""L Staerk"", ids = ""4156830""); list(name = ""Sarah Rosner Preis"", ids = ""2817715""); list(name = ""Honghuang Lin"", ids = ""2923721""); list(name = ""Steven A Lubitz"", ids = ""143681668""); list(name = ""Patrick T.

We previously showed that the onset of Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expression identifies vascular precursors in mouse and human embryonic stem cells. Our goal was to determine the degree of overlap between NRP1+CD34- cells and embryonic primitive streak, and identify novel growth factor signaling pathways controlling their differentiation. Methods: Human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated, and NRP1+CD34- cells were isolated. Following RNA extraction, whole genome transcriptional profiling was performed. Microarray data were compared with undifferentiated stem cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using differential gene expression analysis with a false discovery rate of 5%, and greater than two-fold change between groups. We compared significantly enriched transcripts in NRP1+CD34- cells against genes expressed in the primitive streak in Xenopus embryos using hypergeometric testing. Functional annotation-based clustering was used to identify putative cell signaling pathways. Results: A total of 785 transcripts were significantly enriched in NRP1+CD34- vascular precursors vs. hESCs, and 605 transcripts were unique to NRP1+CD34- vascular precursors. NRP1+CD34- cells shared a significant number of transcripts (46 of 357 human homologs) with ventral mesoderm isolated from Xenopus embryos, (p â‰¤ 1 x 10-14). We then identified CXCL14, Neuregulin 2, Leptin and Apelin receptors as significantly upregulated in NRP1+CD34- vascular precursors, potentially controlling human ventral mesoderm and new vessel formation. Conclusions: NRP1+CD34- vascular precursors have significant transcript identity with ventral mesoderm from embryonic primitive streak, and a unique transcriptional profile compared with HUVECs. These findings suggest NRP1+CD34- human vascular precursors significantly resemble ventral mesoderm, and provide a model of human vascular development. The identification of a comprehensive database of cell-surface receptors expressed by the human ventral mesoderm analogs permits future pharmacological approaches to induce vascular differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Jennifer K Lang"", ids = ""40512414""); list(name = ""Fraser J Sim"", ids = ""34433836""); list(name = ""Thomas R.

1a13f1a22d106e118f54da122ff0f95b21b74a4d,Mapping multiple quantitative trait loci under Bayes error control.,"In mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), performing hypothesis tests of linkage to a phenotype of interest across an entire genome involves multiple comparisons. Furthermore, linkage among loci induces correlation among tests. Under many multiple comparison frameworks, these problems are exacerbated when mapping multiple QTLs. Traditionally, significance thresholds have been subjectively set to control the probability of detecting at least one false positive outcome, although such thresholds are known to result in excessively low power to detect true positive outcomes. Recently, false discovery rate (FDR)-controlling procedures have been developed that yield more power both by relaxing the stringency of the significance threshold and by retaining more power for a given significance threshold. However, these procedures have been shown to perform poorly for mapping QTLs, principally because they ignore recombination fractions between markers. Here, I describe a procedure that accounts for recombination fractions and extends FDR control to include simultaneous control of the false non-discovery rate, i.e. the overall error rate is controlled. This procedure is developed in the Bayesian framework using a direct posterior probability approach. Data-driven significance thresholds are determined by minimizing the expected loss. The procedure is equivalent to jointly maximizing positive and negative predictive values. In the context of mapping QTLs for experimental crosses, the procedure is applicable to mapping main effects, gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Shriner"", ids = ""2706682"")",,ffb9d577b5a424dfa86d7e7f8381857822120798; ce84145e927da873ba419ef8971f9755fea1a64e; 1aad8c282af3eddc22d1f806c40b58c7a7d112c3; 1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558; fee40fd30089e555b9458b29cf3512f35fa27dcb; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; fec121c65654f13109f1826d2dfbf14222e10805; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 14fd7432803ca9aa95021c9a67af0d4c146222f6; d93241426674c600ab8b181a591388f324853b24; 862bd0f9402b581f92e7d9e1979f7ab5647f1853; d78f58e6170d1b4fab239108e7c810f7ab610a00; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; 165a562c4659cb03b504301454784b8265d7b8f8; eaddf84b4d86b92d0d03fd13eabb2fc7f7be756d; 01818509fd55ce907e1c80ba8eb84524871180c5; edcf37921ec68996761007e4a8411f1f3e31276c; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; f462cabdd77694e43359c9d5ac0e8660dcd5afbf; 8986211fb86e2afd7bee0a314aa152c9ce46c48e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2048aa8f10d832d4ed1608f9188cf47d2ec5e71a; 5da091c1d437a74fc4126f14047be4ea1dd0e9fe; 6ebc639349d5f02f87685b948b6858641b921e7a; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; f5f42cbc5442e13c15d6fd170631b4c3b82ada5a; 06e15a6da368a59171fe7b9e3260884cfe7a208c; c70a58a7dab96afae8da20ca8d4df14439d6c929; 3dcf692f8f01427c85bf4c594e07f68e3d77dac3; b10b4d611b2b4f77fe9ae9d24dbdfa8da27326a3; 98b528e539c936911249d4d364aedc0e6236bec6; 8785356dc21c8754ef79be9af32e6f8ef53dc8e1; ac1cabe5a354a855e85ffdeba9e15c3841c4b01f; a69988bdf5b195b0b9e2528da7e76c8307033420; 28087496d717dbb708af1bccc165ff6e60a68f70; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 19a3f5fa915385cb95d8575acbff3f6ee7424410; 50b6a37dea80346593c2539245da25291c3678b0; 0c6b0171fe26bb84e89c244e1f859ebdf86e6e45; 4e48fe956939282d3203e4293f1e68ae96b9aab3,Genetics research,91 3,"

In this study, three different strategies for GWAS were applied to detect QTL for carcass quality traits in the Korean cattle, Hanwoo; a linkage disequilibrium single locus regression method (LDRM), a combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis (LDLA) and a BayesCÏ€ approach. The phenotypes of 486 steers were collected for weaning weight (WWT), yearling weight (YWT), carcass weight (CWT), backfat thickness (BFT), longissimus dorsi muscle area, and marbling score (Marb). Also the genotype data for the steers and their sires were scored with the Illumina bovine 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips. For the two former GWAS methods, threshold values were set at false discovery rate <0.01 on a chromosome-wide level, while a cut-off threshold value was set in the latter model, such that the top five windows, each of which comprised 10 adjacent SNPs, were chosen with significant variation for the phenotype. Four major additive QTL from these three methods had high concordance found in 64.1 to 64.9Mb for Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 7 for WWT, 24.3 to 25.4Mb for BTA14 for CWT, 0.5 to 1.5Mb for BTA6 for BFT and 26.3 to 33.4Mb for BTA29 for BFT. Several candidate genes (i.e. glutamate receptor, ionotropic, ampa 1 [GRIA1], family with sequence similarity 110, member B [FAM110B], and thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box [TOX]) may be identified close to these QTL. Our result suggests that the use of different linkage disequilibrium mapping approaches can provide more reliable chromosome regions to further pinpoint DNA makers or causative genes in these regions.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi Li"", ids = ""47003270""); list(name = ""Jong-Joo Kim"", ids = ""107728208"")",cd5c3ed71ccb630214c4703163332cf0fa871104; 04b3ad2c75e9e7ae80c915f8655fe6a5d6680561; c6094b39b4fb5f9ceb89103defb5206f8ce2f8d6,5d6788ec97ec081b31193c40b0dccebf8465d876; 82f9f6f837ceb631781e7c67c3acbcde2047db06; eee4297075345938904bc5a07b933e6acc4058dc; 5715887936cd5ff2f038d6d282fc262698f4f662; 582bc5d5e5dc6dcb92e3665a34110ef886a115cc; 8de0f4d3168750a2509a7ef72131e055aba4c674; f2ee514c6df6c51e93267d723af84c57625d24bf; 72aebc80c70254ae8ba02297b3e598688911e58f; 2eaa1eabfe83463e15bc0c9a1c60c3264cf0aa17; 32ee82c1c8e90f1265f1c72f8507ac24188b550d; 62c8bb218ad2f4dda766b3349b0185e3ee4ec2cd; 9cd952acca71096e38fe9273a5d0779b1521e0ae; 6fc1f0616caa6f321860f884cf635d0d083de0e6; b6630425e016967b3881b223829482793edaaa69; 91e74d77f079edecc82e724cad1b18738f0c6d2b; 7d599382cd4ce66693c2a0145f348058f8d52ca2; 960d913f207d302284692d15f4382a479344e1cf; c88f2452ef5edaa6148f1e43c7b6813ae9b71952; 4090f1cb0efdd9f5e89d5ba18e67b80978802fb4; ab838eed975a9bd2e57291243f1b6495ea2ae6de; 05fd46498ebfa3272ba8b64470c72aa064d42862; d770bac28f555394b5405e31d7fca9fffcbf1ed3; b75afdb5255412c3d749d72908f4220d49be97a0; 8db816a2b04ccd9d629826cecf432a4d8bb0920e; 9d5cf4e08781d9b3148dc11cf02257922e4b5451; 68c76c8f615aab7fd6f34a4763d45a3c31cc14f4; 8ea0cc0d54fbfe11caabab7f26423f452b51b499; fd87cb4917ceb6bc1a1f5a23d914727e09f6b882; 165a562c4659cb03b504301454784b8265d7b8f8; ba7340f5bb1a68e5d79732350ca27cff4ffa32f4; 938db991e8ab64b8fe971e535c2a4e9896777662,Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences,28,926 - 935

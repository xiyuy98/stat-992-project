402492982bf5b42133eaec1a0b7a204c1b957485,Abstract P5-08-19: A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 3'-UTR region of the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein 4 gene is associated with prognosis of triple negative breast cancer,"Objective Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype with poor prognosis and high heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to screen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the prognosis of TNBC patients and to explore the potential mechanism. Methods We selected SNPs(MAFâ‰¥1%) located on the 39 untranslated region (39UTR) of differentially expressed genes in breast cancer through databases (Nextbio,ensemble,NCBI,MirSNP). We investigated the possible associations between 111 SNPs and progression risk among 323 TNBC patients using two-step case-control study with discovery cohort (n=162) and validation cohort (n=161). The Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to assess the statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied in order to assess the association between disease free survival (DFS) and positive SNPs, as well as Body Mass Index(BMI). We also investigated the expression of FABP4 in adipocytes adjacent to TNBC tissues (n=35) using immunohistochemistry. The integrated optical density (IOD) was measured as an approximation of FABP4 expression. Mann-Whitney U test was used in an attempt to assess the correlations among SNPs in FABP4, FABP4 expression and TNBC prognosis. Results SNPs in FABP4, KRAS and NTRK2 genes associated with the recurrence risk of TNBC throughout the discovery cohort and validation cohort, while the statistical significance was retained after multiple comparisons only for FABP4 rs1054135. The G allele of rs1057035 was associated with decreased risk of disease progression (aHR 0.14, 95%CI0.03-0.66), as well as an increased DFS (P Conclusions Our study found a lipid metabolism related gene and an important SNP in the 39UTR of FABP4 associated with TNBC prognosis, which may aid the screening of high-risk patients with TNBC recurrence and the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents.

This study aimed to identify differentially expressed arterial transcripts in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Global mRNA expression was estimated by microarray hybridization in iliac arteries ( n = 14) from renal transplant recipients and compared with renal arteries from healthy living kidney donors ( n = 19) in study 1. Study 2 compared nonatherosclerotic internal mammary arteries (IMA) from five patients with elevated plasma creatinine levels and age- and sex-matched controls with normal creatinine levels. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry for selected proteins were performed on a subset of study 1 samples. Fifteen gene transcripts were significantly different between the two groups in study 1 [fold changes (FC) > 1.05 and false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.005]. Most upregulated mRNAs associated with cellular signaling, apoptosis, TNFÎ±/NF-ÎºB signaling, smooth muscle contraction, and 10 other pathways were significantly affected. To focus attention on genes from genuine vascular cells, which dominate in IMA, concordant deregulated genes in studies 1 and 2 were examined and included 23 downregulated and eight upregulated transcripts (settings in study 1: FC > 1.05 and FDR < 0.05; study 2: FC > 1.2 and P < 0.2). Selected deregulated gene products were investigated at the protein level, and whereas HIF3Î± confirmed mRNA upregulation, vimentin showed upregulation in contrast to the mRNA results. We conclude that arteries from CKD patients display change in relatively few sets of genes. Many were related to differentiated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. These identified genes may contribute to understanding the development of arterial injury among patients with CKD.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jane Stubbe"", ids = ""38737434""); list(name = ""Vibe Skov"", ids = ""5756873""); list(name = ""Helle Charlotte Thiesson"", ids = ""3877486""); list(name = ""Karl Egon Larsen"", ids = ""47107898""); list(name = ""Maria Lyck Hansen"", ids = ""14731763""); list(name = ""Boye L Jensen"", ids = ""49108271""); list(name = ""Bente Jespersen"", ids = ""4867063""); list(name = ""Lars Melholt Rasmussen"", ids = ""32133564"")",5046a11f969009688578a290f8720ba9ac5f7488,,American journal of physiology.

eac11a9f3c850966801732885a501a179492fb2c,Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Blasts Influence the Gene Expression Signature and Co-Signaling Receptor Expression of CD8+ T Cells,"Background: T cell dysfunction in AML remains poorly understood. Our previous studies of AML-associated T cell dysfunction (Knaus, ASH 2015) have focused on expression of multiple inhibitory receptors by T cells in AML patients. Transcriptional signatures, however, remain relatively unexplored, as does the role of Blast/T cell interactions on T cell function. Deciphering those could be crucial for integration of future immunotherapies into clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to characterize CD8+ T cell gene expression signatures in newly diagnosed AML patients before and after treatment, and to decipher the effects of AML blasts on the expression of co-signaling molecules by CD8+ T cells in co-culture experiments. Methods: Serial peripheral blood (PB) samples (at diagnosis and at the recovery after induction chemotherapy) were collected. To study transcriptional signatures, RNA isolated from FACS-purified PB CD8+ T cells from 6 patients [3 responders (R) and 3 non-responders (NR)] and 4 healthy controls (HC) was analyzed with the Human Prime View Gene Expression Array (Affymetrix). The data were normalized and log transformed. Expression fold change (FC), p values and false discovery rate were determined. Enrichment of canonical pathways was determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN). To study AML blast-T cell interactions, we FACS-purified T cells and primary AML blasts at diagnosis (n=13) and T cells from HC (n=12). T cells were cultured in vitro for 3 days in the presence or absence of blasts (T cell:blast ratio 1:10) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: The transcriptional profile of CD8+ T cells at AML diagnosis significantly differed from that of HC. Genes were selected based on >2 FC between patient and HC, and p Next, we compared R to NR after induction chemotherapy. There were a total of 351 dysregulated genes; 108/243 genes were up-/down-regulated, respectively. R patients upregulated immune stimulatory receptor genes like ICOS, whereas the top expressed genes for NR patients included the co-inhibitory receptor TIM3; several members of the inhibitory LIR receptor family; LST1 (involved in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation); TWEAK-APRIL (associated with T cell apoptosis); and CD39 (terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells). In line with these findings, IPA showed that the co-stimulatory ICOS and OX40 signaling pathways were enriched in R patients. In contrast, the NFAT pathway, which had been highly upregulated at diagnosis, remained enriched in NR, but not in R patients. Results were confirmed by qPCR. The culture assay showed that the presence of primary AML blasts significantly reduced the viability of both AML and HC T cells (p Conclusions: Our study provides insight into the genomic CD8+ T cell signatures of AML patients at diagnosis and following chemotherapy. At diagnosis, T cells overexpressed genes that negatively regulate T cell immune responses, while genes that positively regulate immune responses were downregulated. Interestingly, after induction chemotherapy these changes persisted in NR only. Additionally, a pattern of decreased viability and co-stimulatory receptor expression was seen after in vitro co-culture of T cells with AML blasts, whereas immune inhibitory receptor expression was increased. Our data suggests that the blasts themselves influence the T cell phenotype and genotype in AML patients and that remission is associated with reversion to HC pattern.

66135c0da8624511bcd604f115b6506226be0b21,A new approach to epigenome-wide discovery of non-invasive methylation biomarkers for colorectal cancer screening in circulating cell-free DNA using pooled samples,"BackgroundColorectal cancer is the fourth cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, though detection at early stages associates with good prognosis. Thus, there is a clear demand for novel non-invasive tests for the early detection of colorectal cancer and premalignant advanced adenomas, to be used in population-wide screening programs. Aberrant DNA methylation detected in liquid biopsies, such as serum circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), is a promising source of non-invasive biomarkers. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using cfDNA pooled samples to identify potential serum methylation biomarkers for the detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia (colorectal cancer or advanced adenomas) using microarray-based technology.ResultscfDNA was extracted from serum samples from 20 individuals with no colorectal findings, 20 patients with advanced adenomas, and 20 patients with colorectal cancer (stages I and II). Two pooled samples were prepared for each pathological group using equal amounts of cfDNA from 10 individuals, sex-, age-, and recruitment hospital-matched. We measured the methylation levels of 866,836 CpG positions across the genome using the MethylationEPIC array. Pooled serum cfDNA methylation data meets the quality requirements. The proportion of detected CpG in all pools (>â€‰99% with detection p value <â€‰0.01) exceeded Illumina Infinium methylation data quality metrics of the number of sites detected. The differential methylation analysis revealed 1384 CpG sites (5% false discovery rate) with at least 10% difference in the methylation level between no colorectal findings controls and advanced neoplasia, the majority of which were hypomethylated. Unsupervised clustering showed that cfDNA methylation patterns can distinguish advanced neoplasia from healthy controls, as well as separate tumor tissue from healthy mucosa in an independent dataset. We also observed that advanced adenomas and stage I/II colorectal cancer methylation profiles, grouped as advanced neoplasia, are largely homogenous and clustered close together.ConclusionsThis preliminary study shows the viability of microarray-based methylation biomarker discovery using pooled serum cfDNA samples as an alternative approach to tissue specimens. Our strategy sets an open door for deciphering new non-invasive biomarkers not only for colorectal cancer detection, but also for other types of cancers.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""MarÃ­a Gallardo-GÃ³mez"", ids = ""1404941189""); list(name = ""SebastiÃ¡n Moran"", ids = ""1860121""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a PÃ¡ez de la Cadena"", ids = ""4162381""); list(name = ""Vicenta Soledad MartÃ­nez-Zorzano"", ids = ""1398358634""); list(name = ""Francisco Javier RodrÃ­guez-Berrocal"", ids = ""1397484050""); list(name = ""Mar RodrÃ­guez-Girondo"", ids = ""1398356741""); list(name = ""Manel Esteller"", ids = ""48529566""); list(name = ""JoaquÃ­n Cubiella"", ids = ""4350094""); list(name = ""Luis Bujanda"", ids = ""1401044188""); list(name = ""Antoni Castells"", ids = ""7220900""); list(name = ""Francesc Balaguer"", ids = ""144392846""); list(name = ""Rodrigo Jover"", ids = ""10079400""); list(name = ""Loretta De Chiara"", ids = ""114046149"")",fbd016c598848050c0349ef5dfff147c85f67a0a; 0a94b1dd6aeb2b454a4b0e9c8aa17e6dc5e29bf2; fc6c36d95722721fc40a44db21ee35efd6be4f43; a6beb12ec38e491b88efe2ea70c91627f8d06c36,7df9a920288e02ab08cf1a3b934cf8795128b81f; 061567b2a9300c23205f6275fc30ca359e87f0d8; 4034d82d5f9b24ae62c218c548464ef9e9ef0991; 64adcd41c7a2503040c9e909a01e95551ba97e53; a69fd8dbc611a7f9936c2c9b5ad2f044760965eb; e85e68862dd0eed5ebe900c2721a2dfb1c237c9f; e3ac9d4838fbb19205b70ce279284cb669477238; 01d3783777389fe51f938bcead1386f90ecc3bb3; b83e96720100c2b399b75cee2a75f7e0e45b5499; ad133826686a3c752ee7cab3e24c0dd9d5724043; 57542031a15540582442ff93dd60a4cd1e3760a3; b26aabe689447239c4e979010ffaed441612631a; 6fb2a3e7a025fa2288c7fdf970f5201b50ada31e; b64fdf83631618d64a12fcccae049fe28f55f68b; d9aabb916114b7bf04504733ec37390bab76b717; 6350d14a8834fa1962cb92db670f2a6bca9d9de5; a12a69d740e8e405d6bea5f583fe8c561311d97d; a601a1ea75bde37f4dffd4f4c6025e91d2ae9a29; 0743bba248900bdfc7305f55e9e91086629401c6; b71904d054a81a928a13ebd4c2a38e43f62351a8; 63ee265dd2b1f639b03af20e084e769eb40b0fe4; d1b65dbbf259629435173c516d90c7c9edb2248a; 7cdde1cdc2cd63ff530e30f2874536d6f570ae5f; 43a6e0437be13efeb24ef213d14c8f34120f3126; f877645e9e6190c1b15c1089b4bd6dc454db5daf; 5530f1807586b46902518165f89e4bc81a85e39c; a33ff46ce81ef09c13e297f7c06ebe08857b0879; d491a128212184c658dec599e36b91b193565c22; b07c0c07d3f2de464331cabc7ddfedc0a16c43b5; 39dab331e1c5632f4115a3c409e49f7a22f43970; 2b62c38cd89bfe958197fbe9e5a7697eda6842af; 0692312e93871264632d9573e22a0844d96e761f; c06e81e9210489693a11f785a092e3bf58ba0f9a; b0ddafb2f3a89f0019ec719b85fb86174fa1ce17; f1bcbe5845406cf32742e8d2219498c23337f9a5; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; c1a495f0e7c804f49cff23faded60943c5761896; a0be1abc97baeb0108bdf4d82630e5714cce9699; d759d5096cde630faadc4df7d77200cfef0926d1; d127dddff4c40f50be3bda19167737d11496ccd9; c4aeb4a947a76df87e81d22c0fe1bd7c2175332b; 649ea138039dbfad9282fa89a1988e45523fa0f4; abdcdfcfd9172dfa436d90f461bd60b20ac89988; 3bbc46a752b1c00a50a64550cc5c648bb98eda14; b18eb59cbcec8f567074c035b534848ad8239317; 22eb3fe583bd3e9435360e462bb81d9e9c417c12; e751bd046c338240918d9236d7e42228e81b3c71; 5291ab729bc9219b59b0675af0eed8f981177bf8,Clinical Epigenetics,10,

In practice, this is insatisfacory since we also have to keep in mind the power of detecting true effects. At the moment, the preferred choice of practitioners is often restricted to family-wise error rates (FWER) and false discovery rates (FDR). We recently introduced the scaled multiple testing error rates, which includes most existing error rates and bridges the gap between the FWER and the FDR. For example, the Scaled False Discovery Rate (SFDR) limits the number of false positives (FP) relative to an arbitrary increasing function (s) of the number of rejections (R), by bounding E(FP/s(R)). We compare the performance for different choices of the scaling function s and discuss the optimality of the error rates in some practical scenarios by considering the number of false positives FP separately from the number of true positives TP.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Djalel Eddine Meskaldji"", ids = ""5819738""); list(name = ""Dimitri Van De Ville"", ids = ""1748289""); list(name = ""S.

24aa62e6c88d7979010658df998b0ba1281ddc6a,Gene expression in normal-appearing tissue adjacent to prostate cancers are predictive of clinical outcome: evidence for a biologically meaningful field effect,"PURPOSE
We evaluated gene expression in histologically normal-appearing tissue (NT) adjacent to prostate tumor in radical prostatectomy specimens, assessing for biological significance based on prediction of clinical recurrence (cR - metastatic disease or local recurrence).


RESULTS
A total of 410 evaluable patients had paired tumor and NT. Forty-six genes, representing diverse biological pathways (androgen signaling, stromal response, stress response, cellular organization, proliferation, cell adhesion, and chromatin remodeling) were associated with cR in NT (FDR < 20%), of which 39 concordantly predicted cR in tumor (FDR < 20%). Overall GPS and its stromal response and androgen-signaling gene group components also significantly predicted time to cR in NT (RM-corrected HR/20 units = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01-1.56; P = 0.024).


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Expression of 732 genes was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) separately in tumor and adjacent NT specimens from 127 patients with and 374 without cR following radical prostatectomy for T1/T2 prostate cancer. A 17-gene expression signature (Genomic Prostate Score [GPS]), previously validated to predict aggressive prostate cancer when measured in tumor tissue, was also assessed using pre-specified genes and algorithms. Analysis used Cox proportional hazards models, Storey's false discovery rate (FDR) control, and regression to the mean (RM) correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression profiles, including GPS, from NT adjacent to tumor can predict prostate cancer outcome. These findings suggest that there is a biologically significant field effect in primary prostate cancer that is a marker for aggressive disease.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Cristina Magi-Galluzzi"", ids = ""1398034828""); list(name = ""Tara Maddala"", ids = ""3747556""); list(name = ""Sara M Falzarano"", ids = ""34895140""); list(name = ""Diana B.

8dde27070a1bdf31de12f124e33097a7672e062c,Evaluation of the Association Between Genetic Variants in Circadian Rhythm Genes and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Identifies a Potential Functional Allele in the Transcription Factor TEF,"Previous studies suggest that genetic variants within genes affecting the circadian rhythm influence the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). In the present study, we used data from three emergency care-based cohorts to search genetic variants in circadian pathway genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders for variants that influence PTSS severity. The three cohorts used included a discovery cohort of African American men and women enrolled following motor vehicle collision (n = 907) and two replication cohorts: one of multi-ethnic women enrolled following sexual assault (n = 274) and one of multi-ethnic men and women enrolled following major thermal burn injury (n = 68). DNA and RNA were collected from trauma survivors at the time of initial assessment. Validated questionnaires were used to assess peritraumatic distress severity and to assess PTSS severity 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year following trauma exposure. Thirty-one genetic variants from circadian rhythm genes were selected for analyses, and main effect and potential gene*stress and gene*sex interactions were evaluated. Secondary analyses assessed whether associated genetic variants affected mRNA expression levels. We found that six genetic variants across five circadian rhythm-associated genes predicted PTSS outcomes following motor vehicle collision (p < 0.05), but only two of these variants survived adjustment for multiple comparisons (False Discovery Rate < 5%). The strongest of these associations, an interaction between the PAR-zip transcription factor, thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) variant rs5758324 and peritraumatic distress, predicted PTSS development in all three cohorts. Further analysis of genetic variants in the genetic region surrounding TEFrs5758324 (Â±125,000 nucleotides) indicated that this allele showed the strongest association. Further, TEF RNA expression levels (determined via RNA-seq) were positively associated with PTSS severity in distressed individuals with at least one copy of the TEFrs5758324 minor allele. These results suggest that rs5758324 genetic variant in TEF, a regulator of clock-controlled genes and key mediator of the core circadian rhythm, influence PTSS severity in a stress-dependent manner.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah D.

80c2fd0ac1251ad72b3f834ffcbac12e92dd8096,High-density chemical cross-linking for modeling protein interactions.,"Detailed mechanistic understanding of protein complex function is greatly enhanced by insights from its 3-dimensional structure. Traditional methods of protein structure elucidation remain expensive and labor-intensive and require highly purified starting material. Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry offers an alternative that has seen increased use, especially in combination with other experimental approaches like cryo-electron microscopy. Here we report advances in method development, combining several orthogonal cross-linking chemistries as well as improvements in search algorithms, statistical analysis, and computational cost to achieve coverage of 1 unique cross-linked position pair for every 7 amino acids at a 1% false discovery rate. This is accomplished without any peptide-level fractionation or enrichment. We apply our methods to model the complex between a carbonic anhydrase (CA) and its protein inhibitor, showing that the cross-links are self-consistent and define the interaction interface at high resolution. The resulting model suggests a scaffold for development of a class of protein-based inhibitors of the CA family of enzymes. We next cross-link the yeast proteasome, identifying 3,893 unique cross-linked peptides in 3 mass spectrometry runs. The dataset includes 1,704 unique cross-linked position pairs for the proteasome subunits, more than half of them intersubunit. Using multiple recently solved cryo-EM structures, we show that observed cross-links reflect the conformational dynamics and disorder of some proteasome subunits. We further demonstrate that this level of cross-linking density is sufficient to model the architecture of the 19-subunit regulatory particle de novo.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julian Mintseris"", ids = ""3168120""); list(name = ""Steven P Gygi"", ids = ""2665934"")",,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,
f170de02271d5471c106c64627acdeb019172ada,Increasing Protein Identification Using Coupled Chip Based NanoLC Columns.,"Nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with nano-electrospray (nanoLC-MS) is the method of choice for sensitive peptide and protein analysis for proteomics research. We recently reported on a new microfluidic platform (cHiPLC-nanoflex) for nanoLC-MS applications. In addition to delivering easy-to-use, dead-volume-free connections to microfluidic devices, the platform's cHiPLC columns provide excellent column-to-column separation reproducibility. We have reported previously(1) that while increasing only gradient time or column length can improve peak capacity, using a longer column in combination with increasing gradient time is the most effective way of obtaining higher peak capacity. In this presentation we report on how the dead volume free connections of the cHiPLC Nanoflex platform allow for the coupling of two 15 cm long chip columns for improved resolution. The proposed set-up makes it easy to switch between single and dual column mode depending on application requirements. An additional advantage of using two separate 15 cm columns rather than one 30cm column is that sample matrix components that are not retained on the first column (e.g. salts) can be directed to waste, instead of entering the nanospray source/mass spectrometer. We have investigated the effect of increased resolution through doubling column length on the number of peptides/proteins identified in a digested cytosolic fraction of a human cell lysate using various gradient lengths. An ABSCIEX TripleTOF 5600â„¢ MS was used with an Information Dependent Acquisition method consisting of a TOF MS survey scan at 30 000 resolution, followed by 20 MS/MS in a second at >15 000 resolution. All data was processed using ProteinPilotâ„¢ Software 4.0 with integrated false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. 1 Remco van Soest*, David W.

a9b1d35517be91321bc77626866502bc4bdc76c1,Heterozygous carriers of a Parkin or PINK1 mutation share a common functional endophenotypeSYMBOL,"Objective:To use a combined neurogenetic-neuroimaging approach to examine the functional consequences of preclinical dopaminergic nigrostriatal dysfunction in the human motor system. Specifically, we examined how a single heterozygous mutation in different genes associated with recessively inherited Parkinson disease alters the cortical control of sequential finger movements. Methods:Nonmanifesting individuals carrying a single heterozygous Parkin (n = 13) or PINK1 (n = 9) mutation and 23 healthy controls without these mutations were studied with functional MRI (fMRI). During fMRI, participants performed simple sequences of three thumb-to-finger opposition movements with their right dominant hand. Since heterozygous Parkin and PINK1 mutations cause a latent dopaminergic nigrostriatal dysfunction, we predicted a compensatory recruitment of those rostral premotor areas that are normally implicated in the control of complex motor sequences. We expected this overactivity to be independent of the underlying genotype. Results:Task performance was comparable for all groups. The performance of a simple motor sequence task consistently activated the rostral supplementary motor area and right rostral dorsal premotor cortex in mutation carriers but not in controls. Task-related activation of these premotor areas was similar in carriers of a Parkin or PINK1 mutation. Conclusion:Mutations in different genes linked to recessively inherited Parkinson disease are associated with an additional recruitment of rostral supplementary motor area and rostral dorsal premotor cortex during a simple motor sequence task. These premotor areas were recruited independently of the underlying genotype. The observed activation most likely reflects a â€œgenericâ€ compensatory mechanism to maintain motor function in the context of a mild dopaminergic deficit.

e3fb0fd2546fa3378c801350f4a8ee06396f9e0f,Mitochondria sequence mapping strategies and practicability of mitochondria variant detection from exome and RNA sequencing data,"The rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing has significantly enriched our capacity for studying the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In addition to performing specific mitochondrial targeted sequencing, an increasingly popular alternative approach is using the off-target reads from exome sequencing to infer mtDNA variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and heteroplasmy. However, the effectiveness and practicality of this approach have not been tested. Recently, RNAseq data have also been suggested as a good source for alternative data mining, but whether mitochondrial variants can be detected from RNAseq data has not been validated. We designed a study to evaluate the practicability of mtDNA variant detection using exome and RNA sequencing data. Five breast cancer cell lines were sequenced through mitochondrial targeted, exome, and RNA sequencing. Mitochondrial targeted sequencing was used as the gold standard to compute the validation and false discovery rates of SNP and heteroplasmy detection in exome and RNAseq data. We found that exome and RNA sequencing can accurately detect mitochondrial SNPs. However, the lower false discovery rate makes exome sequencing a better choice for heteroplasmy detection than RNAseq. Furthermore, we examined three alignment strategies and found that aligning reads directly to the mitochondrial reference genome or aligning reads to the nuclear and mitochondrial references genomes simultaneously produced the best results, and that aligning to the nuclear genome first and afterwards to the mitochondrial genome performed poorly. In conclusion, our study provides important guidelines for future studies that intend to use either exome sequencing or RNAseq data to infer mitochondrial SNPs and heteroplasmy.",2016,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pan Zhang"", ids = ""144974901""); list(name = ""David C.

In order to identify the underlying biological causation of this disease, a comparative genomic hybridization dataset generated from 170 patientsâ€™ tumor samples was analyzed. Of many available segmentation algorithms, I focused mainly on two most acceptable methods: Homogeneous Hidden Markov Models (HHMM) and Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS). Simulations show that CBS tends to give better segmentation result with low false discovery rate. HHMM failed to identify many obvious breakpoints that CBS identified. On the other hand, HHMM succeeds in identifying many single probe aberrations. Applying other statistical algorithms revealed distinct biological fingerprints of Glioblastoma disease, which includes many signature genes and biological pathways. Survival analysis also reveals that several segments actually correlate to the extended survival time of some patients. In summary, this work shows the importance of statistical model or algorithms in the modern genomic research.

However, responses are heterogeneous and resistance to therapy is a pressing clinical problem. With the goal of developing liquid biomarkers to aid in treatment selection, we sought to identify genes associated with resistance to chemotherapy using a circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based approach. METHODS: Whole blood (~5mL) was obtained from 25 patients with mCRPC starting docetaxel (n1â„421) or cabazitaxel (n1â„44). CTCs were isolated using anti-EpCAM-conjugated magnetic beads, and following cell lysis, mRNA was extracted followed by multiplex qRTPCR for 44 prostate cancer-related genes plus internal controls. Gene expression was normalized to controls, and samples were considered CTC-positive based on a previously established set of epithelial markers (EpCAM, EGFR, DSG2, KRT8, KRT18 and KRT19). The primary endpoint was PSA progression-free survival (PFS), with PSA progression defined as an increase of 25% or more above the nadir. Univariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess for genes associated with PFS at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.20. RESULTS: Among 25 patients with mCRPC, we identified 84% (21/25) with detectable CTCs. The median age of the cohort was 62 years (IQR 58-70). At a median (IQR) follow up of 5.4 (3.4-9.3) months, 47.6 % (10/21) of patients showed a PSA decrease of at least 30% following treatment initiation. 18/21 patients (85.7%) experienced PSA progression at a median of 2.8 months (IQR 1.7-4.8). In the Cox analysis, KLK2 (HR 2.54, 95%CI 1.24-5.21, p1â„40.011), GAS6 (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.30-9.42, p1â„40.013), and BMP7 (HR 2.01, 95%CI 1.15-3.52; p1â„40.014) were associated with shorter PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Wehave identified three genes associatedwith progression in mCRPC patients initiating chemotherapy. While these early results need further confirmation, they suggest that CTCs may be utilized to help guide precision-based treatment strategies in patients with mCRPC. Additionally, these results corroborate our recent in vitro and in vivo findings (Lee et al, J Cell Biochem, 2016) indicating that GAS6 protects prostate cancer cells from docetaxel-induced apoptosis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric J.

97025f4e93cd6d993cc6a7e7ec3e60a0b131a291,Aberrant DNA Methylation of Blood in Schizophrenia by Adjusting for Estimated Cellular Proportions,"DNA methylation, which is the transference of a methyl group to the 5â€²-carbon position of the cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide, is one of the major mechanisms of epigenetic modifications. A number of studies have demonstrated altered DNA methylation of peripheral blood cells in schizophrenia (SCZ) in previous studies. However, most of these studies have been limited to the analysis of the CpG sites in CpG islands in gene promoter regions, and cell-type proportions of peripheral leukocytes, which may be one of the potential confounding factors for DNA methylation, have not been adjusted in these studies. In this study, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of the peripheral leukocytes from patients with SCZ and from non-psychiatric controls (NÂ =Â 105; 63 SCZ and 42 control subjects) using a quantitative high-resolution DNA methylation microarray which covered across the whole gene region (485,764 CpG dinucleotides). In the DNA methylation data analysis, we first estimated the cell-type proportions of each sample with a published algorithm. Next, we performed a surrogate variable analysis to identify potential confounding factors in our microarray data. Finally, we conducted a multiple linear regression analysis in consideration of these factors, including estimated cell-type proportions, and identified aberrant DNA methylation in SCZ at 2,552 CpG loci at a 5Â % false discovery rate correction. Our results suggest that altered DNA methylation may be involved in the pathophysiology of SCZ, and cell heterogeneity adjustments may be necessary for DNA methylation analysis.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Makoto Kinoshita"", ids = ""35047207""); list(name = ""Shusuke Numata"", ids = ""4226110""); list(name = ""Atsushi Tajima"", ids = ""2091182""); list(name = ""Kazutaka Ohi"", ids = ""144747980""); list(name = ""Ryota Hashimoto"", ids = ""145507275""); list(name = ""Shinji Shimodera"", ids = ""4326891""); list(name = ""Issei Imoto"", ids = ""47805563""); list(name = ""Masatoshi Takeda"", ids = ""145197448""); list(name = ""Tetsuro Ohmori"", ids = ""3167263"")",1ca1e3c7d9e6ead76d284757d05c293516ebaab8; 340e585e635f5e3e2c00a5f3e359dfdce762490f; 120fdf68bc0014217fb1c78c027887b02b0f6472; ab7e8a03bd573bbd6af06199682fce5b3866112a; 9d599fb7845628a7134af085de00486d6f2aaef1; 6f010de133613eb3a3894d6f5ded8312f8ecabee; 43868719d3e670f0718b8be6d5c0576e3b91cff6; 79ac65be235efc1ad872e71484f77221a3ec2d07; 565a2159aa0171df40097f63a0cdf1c832ad5be9; e1e58685842a3c2bc0f75c822399dc0636597acc; 69182430928f00268a50854de3489550db5ac463; 911d0618cc8f58aa1fcf74bcfa131349c9ab294d; a79f4f5add98c75a098cc0c6c958bf444e09241e; e552a56599aa5eda66e30e2d72af69d7083e264d; 5b9e7d0f40af3999343deddb43847ee48c24133e; d340794ff6a8bb0281b4d113a6a0aab35260868a; 2bc7feb4a63a084219590841856e2dfc833c9cc9; 8d88f0e506a6c4a9755800151c43a60319ef5908; 62f80cfad7c24562ef8e3275be95f2b54f672069; bbf2e63517c9d356ce7ecd0d20b5cae4e58a313f,7fd9550403c4ed4bd66bd60fb2d16e4eef43c54b; 7ee085b1529eae3f8dcd4b8305b949d62293f27c; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 05bf87ea42243e17344abb3b499d4d23e6d389b1; da5bd139b0b0431d2c2611b8b4ba1f00a5b22f09; 8f32778705091faf4bea3cbb2f00abf2dc7ab148; b86d7c1cdc1533182fd76eb45af1e0dc5d081dac; 0f03521dec4d7d104a41bfb3b8f9471d331e84f0; 5e7dcd915e75f0c96b7d0f41e8f5c2a92f5047d5; 251e039bb03f3256361a73f9829e7faadb76e57e; 484958b898e1a7df7cef3a114aa71a87052524b1; 2de24e331da6d130ddcbb0bf4482d3a2aaf6b99f; 2c76be8a2936539d75ef510ce9a8e2e31f11c1bc; e35a8a366731bf39d11cca01cd453f0322b9c282; 874eb283817bebbd47d11e6a463156380abc0e15; 9ac7015ec01dd37001e69879a92b273e8d43b1ce; 23a9cb6295b8c06971250d27315054b41dd92a76; 33ec67d1d6561884b2cc0ccdbf0831368fac070a; f9e02232a145ba69c37eeaa331a58510c05a1563; c1a8b4ae2ee44d2224f72a29d744827056f1c9ad; 2aee86d5bf73138010a76536183d896a7a5a3200; bc59dd7514e4d9ec55123cdb157a1dfd5dde0712; 93fb408df5a41a85f6629738dd35a81028f39ec1; 242df4b9ff70ef316a7a91beb7f6c7d17411dec9; bb756625916cc91822d283ea74da33f5f426a065; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; b658d6bf2f661dee53f26c2a3f939e9d7e723b53; 69d32ad1489d79cfee1e334cce34a546cb4de619; cb813dfc48247d0b65f1cb1084a5b4bccf6f3de8; dd841b223168e1234bdfb685792c915f8d70681a; 842d855a28b79873912b9e50a818bbef52b04838; 94921a501668edbf51c093a99627700f79b82587; 65f8d5c3e0755acdba5a267989fcb4d9ee27970b; f58cd82089dcc2eb818ed70e9202ba2420ca2903; c94efa0d9a2016700c45c3780243160a9ab54b26; b3a304f46ef7af6aecce74ceffc09da25060b49a; a8e2e5f3b186a3f6f610063ff59e832fc30f7745; 4b383519bc499ad88c08e57602856ff964233dde; ee4a948bf44cf7dbcac617e7b1bf7789b4008187; a9f3a47551db69b8febd5571d2ee8a00ad48b7f3; 01d3783777389fe51f938bcead1386f90ecc3bb3; 4129c151bc92ceef9d79a7b731cadbc3502760a8; a415b8c00b8c681707256e4fd0636bf0021e8657; 240f200c043de801a0c8344c9920a0e129ec510f; ddb766cc5e8f86869b3b7b29e2eefa1fda8ebbf3; b5c944e5d11a89b811d1b282c33ff558d1261e73; 4b8ba07b8f4a961998caf4be948195cd4268f04d; 6238813703b3729ca42d84a9caad62fe2de67983; 56043f9e94278cf628acb5f193ac9b2c22ee44e7; 06afa6904f39b0760ea56c71ea9b8d17065f0fa9; b983fb597d618daf85856670736d784815a95e07; 20a567e86321cc5202cbb487d32c5baaf6639d35; 2861e04185eb254bae9fbe38be8ac843fd98328f; 77c4b74b0fb7037f4a62035bca405b1d60c90d3d; 33941ec7c69518fbc8a51c62698595f1f1838ba8; db3294c991b47c70ba79ba9b6d18698770e45646; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 6df0362e23a9b619af03a2aaed255bb286c9e030,NeuroMolecular Medicine,16,697-703
9f018cb1e640813df7598c9ebdde67d7b65c7ce0,Gene expression profile of subcutaneous adipose tissue in BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs unravels molecular and clinical changes associated with sub-types of obesity,"Background:Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) undergoes major changes in obesity, but little is known about the whole-genome scale patterns of these changes or about their variation between different obesity sub-groups. We sought to compare how transcriptomics profiles in SAT differ between monozygotic (MZ) co-twins who are discordant for body mass index (BMI), whether the profiles vary between twin pairs and whether the variation can be linked to clinical characteristics.Methods:We analysed the transcriptomics (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0) patterns of SAT in young MZ twin pairs (n=26, intra-pair difference in BMI >3â€‰kgâ€‰mâˆ’2, aged 23â€“36), from 10 birth cohorts of adult Finnish twins. The clinical data included measurements of body composition, insulin resistance, lipids and adipokines.Results:We found 2108 genes differentially expressed (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05) in SAT of the BMI-discordant pairs. Pathway analyses of these genes revealed a significant downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative pathways (P<0.05) and upregulation of inflammation pathways (P<0.05). Hierarchical clustering of heavy/lean twin ratios, representing effects of acquired obesity in the transcriptomics data, revealed three sub-groups with different molecular profiles (FDR<0.05). Analyses comparing these sub-groups showed that, in the heavy co-twins, downregulation of the mitochondrial pathways, especially that of branched chain amino acid degradation was more evident in two clusters while and upregulation of the inflammatory response was most evident in the last, presumably the unhealthiest cluster. High-fasting insulin levels and large adipocyte diameter were the predominant clinical characteristic of the heavy co-twins in this cluster (Bonferroni-adjusted P<0.05).Conclusions:This is the first study in BMI-discordant MZ twin pairs reporting sub-types of obesity based on both SAT gene expression profiles and clinical traits. We conclude that a decrease in mitochondrial BCAA degradation and an increase in inflammation in SAT co-occur and associate with hyperinsulinemia and large adipocyte size in unhealthy obesity.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maheswary Muniandy"", ids = ""9411901""); list(name = ""Sini Heinonen"", ids = ""2317551""); list(name = ""Hannele Ykiâ\200“JÃ¤rvinen"", ids = ""1396489870""); list(name = ""Antti Hakkarainen"", ids = ""3175275""); list(name = ""J.

e61e8ece925f2cd0a0e0a3e9cfb532af7bea884c,Abstract 1671: Inflammatory pathway genes may have stronger associations with hyperplastic polyps than with adenomas,"Proceedings: AACR 103rd Annual Meeting 2012â€â€ Mar 31â€Apr 4, 2012; Chicago, IL

The prostaglandin synthesis pathway is critical for regulation of inflammatory processes in the colon and plays a well-defined role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Genetic variation in prostaglandin synthases, PTGS-1 (COX-1) and PTGS-2 (COX-2), and enzymes that regulate the pathway such as IÎ±BKB and NFÎºB, has been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. However, the role of variability in these genes in relation to the development of distinct subtypes of early colorectal neoplasia has not been investigated. We therefore examined polymorphisms in prostaglandin synthesis pathway genes in relation to the risk of various subtypes of colorectal polyps. Study participants were enrollees of Group Health, an integrated healthcare provider in Washington State, aged 20 to 79, who underwent colonoscopy for any indication between 1998 and 2007. We excluded those with prior CRC, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, or colectomy. Participants completed a structured interview, provided a DNA sample, and lesions discovered at colonoscopy received a standardized pathology review. HapMap was used to select 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 genes for investigation: 5 in PTGS-1, 4 in PTGS-2, 3 in IÎ±BKB and 6 in NFÎºB. Multiplex genotyping was performed utilizing the Illumina GoldenGate assay. Polytomous logistic regression compared genetic variation between individuals free of colorectal pathology and two case groups with colorectal polyps: 1) adenomas (ADs) and 2) hyperplastic polyps (HPs). Models were adjusted for age, sex, and race. Differences by type of lesion (AD vs. HP) were considered using contrasts of regression parameters. A gene-by-gene analysis approach was taken; the false discovery rate method of Benjamini and Hochberg was applied to address multiple testing. We evaluated approximately 929 cases, including 526 with ADs and 403 with HPs, as well as 826 controls free of colorectal pathologies. We observed a statistically significant association between HPs and genetic variation in PTGS-1 (rs10306194, ORAC vs. CC: 1.26; 95% CI 0.94-1.68, ORAA vs. CC: 1.74; 95% CI 0.88-3.42, P-trend=0.04). No associations were observed for ADs. Significant heterogeneity in the association between genetic variants and colorectal polyps according to the polyp type (AD vs. HP) was observed for 1 SNP in both PTGS-2 ([rs689466][1]) and IÎ±BKB (rs5029748) and 2 SNPs in NFÎºB (rs3774959, [rs230510][2]), with p-values ranging from 0.03-0.05. In each case, the variant showed evidence of an association with the risk of HPs but not ADs. Correction for multiple testing confirmed the existence of heterogeneity in associations according to type of colorectal polyp. These data suggest that genetic variation in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway may be associated with the development of specific subtypes of early colorectal neoplasia.

Although striking dimorphic expressions have been detected at the transcriptional level between the silkworm larval testis and the ovary, the sex-dimorphic expressions at the protein level have not yet been well characterized. The proteome of silkworm larval gonads was investigated using a shotgun-based identification. A total of 286 and 205 nonredundant proteins were identified from the silkworm testis and ovary, respectively, with a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 1%. Only 40 and 16 proteins were previously identified, and 246 and 189 proteins were newly identified in the silkworm testis and the ovary, respectively. The gametogenesis mechanism of silkworm was demonstrated using the protein expression profile and bioinformatics analysis. Cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) showed to be highly abundant in testis, while tubulins were abundant in ovary. Several homologies of Drosophila essential proteins for gametogenesis were identified in silkworm, such as male meiotic arrest gene product ALY and VISMAY in testis, and maternal mRNA localization protein exuperantia and SQUID in ovary. The gene ontology (GO) annotation and pathway analysis provide system-level insights into the sexual dimorphism and gametogenesis.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jin-e Chen"", ids = ""14584780""); list(name = ""Jian-ying Li"", ids = ""39359226""); list(name = ""Zheng-ying You"", ids = ""46449471""); list(name = ""Li-li Liu"", ids = ""4976554""); list(name = ""Jian-she Liang"", ids = ""16219349""); list(name = ""Ying-ying Ma"", ids = ""3603073""); list(name = ""Ming Chen"", ids = ""145345347""); list(name = ""Hua-rong Zhang"", ids = ""7214368""); list(name = ""Zhen-dong Jiang"", ids = ""12760950""); list(name = ""Bo-Xiong Zhong"", ids = ""152390764"")",4ba36d37a49a0f0ad88ad4e429756c9756b67300; dd1439df8519bba566d67dc12bfb7076140c4b1f; 89a1da9ca537005bb1980151da3e0cb59a2ef7d4; af868398a1e9de95973803ad1d22ddb1faad7b68; 2e135f57c70028ee166a3bf62bd19b4c5e6cee4a,,Journal of proteome research,12 6,"

The analysis of glycoproteins introduces additional computational challenges to the workflow. In this study, we used the high resolution and accurate mass features of the Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer combined with glycopeptide enrichment to analyze glycoprotein changes in a breast cancer cell model. We employed BYONIC, a bioinformatics search engine optimized for glycoprotein analysis. We are in the process of comparing these results with workflows involving MASCOT to identify false positive rates from the dataset. In addition; we will determine relative quantitation of the deamidated peptides with Pinpoint. Methods: We compared the expression of glycoproteins between a â€œbenignâ€ (MSF10A) and breast cancer (HCC70) cell line. Glycans of secreted and cell surface glycoproteins of breast cell lines (MCF10A and HCC70) were oxidized with periodate and cells lysed with a non-ionic detergent buffer. Lysates were mixed with hydrazide-modified magnetic beads to capture glycoproteins, and glycopeptides generated with trypsin and PNGaseF (results in delta mass of 0.984 for deamidated peptides). Glycopeptides were analyzed by LC/MS/MS on a Q Exactive in data dependent acquisition mode set to top12 HCD. Preliminary Results Mascot and Byonic will be used to evaluate the identification of the deamidated peptides. Currently, using MASCOT on the two cell lines, we identified 500 glycoproteins, The averaged mascot ion (e.g., ion scores of 81.0 vs. 69.1 for 2+ ions, and 67.7 vs. 53.3 for 3+ ions) gave identifications within 1% false discovery rate for the deamidated peptides searched against the 22,763 proteins related to human taxonomy via Swissprot database search. The bioinformatic approaches for identifying deamidated peptides will be evaluated with Byonic compared to the MASCOT results based on the number of identified N-linked glycopeptides; the false positive rates; speed of analysis; identification of multiple consensus sites (NX-S/T/Y) on same peptide and overall dynamic range of the identified deamidated peptides. For other comparable searches, the Byonic output with the same database search was considerably faster (10s of seconds versus several minutes for the MASCOT search). Byonic streamlines PTM searches by applying specific number of modifications per peptide to avoid combinatorial explosion; increasing the search efficiency. Citation Format: Sucharita M.

To better understand mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, a clonal subline (A2780/C10B) isolated from an oxaliplatin-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780/C10) was developed, as reported previously. This cell line is 18-fold resistant to oxaliplatin and shows a 3-fold cross resistance to cisplatin. Here, we report on the gene expression analysis using Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 oligonucleotide arrays of cells in log phase growth from both the parental cell line and drug-resistant variant. Probe level analysis was perfomed using the model based expression index (dChip) and robust multichip average (RMA) methods. Genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method with a minimum false discovery rate <1%. We identified 43 genes that were overexpressed, and 39 underexpressed in the drug-resistant cell line. Collagen VI (COL6A3) was overexpressed 62-fold and the most highly up-regulated gene. This finding is consistent with other published data based on serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) profiling of cisplatin-resistant and sensitive ovarian carcinoma cells. Among the significant functional groups of overexpressed genes in our study were extracellular matrix genes (9 of 43) and those involved in signal transduction (7 of 43). Extracellular matrix genes included two matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3 and MMP12). Integrin alpha 1 (ITGA1) and WNT5A were also overexpressed. Genes that encode for extracellular matrix proteins were also among those found down-regulated in the resistant cell line. Several genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle and growth were found to be underexpressed, including the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), necdin (NDN), and glypicans (GPC3 and GPC4). The mRNA levels of six differentially expressed genes (COL6A3, MMP12, MMP3, WNT5A, NID, and HMGB2) were validated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The identification of these genes should aid in a better understanding of the pathways resulting in platinum drug resistance.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rama R Varma"", ids = ""144882358""); list(name = ""Suzanne M Hector"", ids = ""6167701""); list(name = ""Kimberly Clark"", ids = ""35178454""); list(name = ""William R.

a0dfb362a09fbe26a0977e3fd7cabf98e6afed03,Mitigating effects of L-selenomethionine on low-dose iron ion radiation-induced changes in gene expression associated with cellular stress,"Ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles poses a danger to astronauts during space travel. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the patterns of gene expression associated with cellular exposure to low-dose iron ion irradiation, in the presence and absence of L-selenomethionine (SeM). Human thyroid epithelial cells (HTori-3) were exposed to low-dose iron ion (1 GeV/n) irradiation at 10 or 20 cGy with or without SeM pretreatment. The cells were harvested 6 and 16 h post-irradiation and analyzed by the Affymetrix U133Av2 gene chip arrays. Genes exhibiting a 1.5-fold expression cut-off and 5% false discovery rate (FDR) were considered statistically significant and subsequently analyzed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for pathway analysis. Representative genes were further validated by real-time RT-PCR. Even at low doses of radiation from iron ions, global genome profiling of the irradiated cells revealed the upregulation of genes associated with the activation of stress-related signaling pathways (ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, p53 signaling, cell cycle and apoptosis), which occurred in a dose-dependent manner. A 24-h pretreatment with SeM was shown to reduce the radiation effects by mitigating stress-related signaling pathways and downregulating certain genes associated with cell adhesion. The mechanism by which SeM prevents radiation-induced transformation in vitro may involve the suppression of the expression of genes associated with stress-related signaling and certain cell adhesion events.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Manunya Nuth"", ids = ""49792360""); list(name = ""Ann R.

9ff7798a9c11708b5786f9b87b4007592d32f783,Transcriptome analysis of seed dormancy after rinsing and chilling in ornamental peaches (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch),"BackgroundOrnamental peaches cv. â€˜Yaguchiâ€™ (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) can be propagated via seeds. The establishment of efficient seed treatments for early germination and seedling growth is required to shorten nursery and breeding periods. It is important, therefore, to identify potential candidate genes responsible for the effects of rinsing and chilling on seed germination. We hypothesized that longer rinsing combined with chilling of seeds can alter the genes expression in related to dormancy and then raise the germination rate in the peach. To date, most molecular studies in peaches have involved structural genomics, and few transcriptome studies of seed germination have been conducted. In this study, we investigated the function of key seed dormancy-related genes using next-generation sequencing to profile the transcriptomes involved in seed dormancy in peaches. De novo assembly and analysis of the transcriptome identified differentially expressed and unique genes present in this fruit.ResultsDe novo RNA-sequencing of peach was performed using the Illumina Miseq 2000 system. Paired-end sequence from mRNAs generated high quality sequence reads (9,049,964, 10,026,362 and 10,101,918 reads) from â€˜Yaguchiâ€™ peach seeds before rinsed (BR) and after rinsed for 2 or 7Â days with a chilling period of 4Â weeks (termed 2D4W and 7D4W), respectively. The germination rate of 7D4W was significantly higher than that of 2D4W. In total, we obtained 51,366 unique sequences. Differential expression analysis identified 7752, 8469 and 506 differentially expressed genes from BR vs 2D4W, BR vs 7D4W and 2D4W vs 7D4W libraries respectively, filtered based on p-value and an adjusted false discovery rate of less than 0.05. This study identified genes associated with the rinsing and chilling process that included those associated with phytohormones, the stress response and transcription factors. 7D4W treatment downregulated genes involved in ABA synthesis, catabolism and signaling pathways, which eventually suppressed abscisic acid activity and consequently promoted germination and seedling growth. Stress response genes were also downregulated by the 7D4W treatment, suggesting that this treatment released seeds from endodormancy. Transcription factors were upregulated by the BR and 2D4W treatment, suggesting that they play important roles in maintaining seed dormancy.ConclusionsThis work indicated that longer rinsing combined with chilling affects gene expression and germination rate, and identified potential candidate genes responsible for dormancy progression in seeds of â€˜Yaguchiâ€™ peach. The results could be used to develop breeding programs and will aid future functional genomic research in peaches and other fruit trees.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Worarad Kanjana"", ids = ""5906790""); list(name = ""Tomohiro Suzuki"", ids = ""2555149""); list(name = ""Kazuo Ishii"", ids = ""49584227""); list(name = ""Toshinori Kozaki"", ids = ""47228956""); list(name = ""Masayuki Iigo"", ids = ""47049803""); list(name = ""Kenji Yamane"", ids = ""8686243"")",dbcfa9b8027ccd4671869d163c0e79e053825987,ffbb338ca39673852ef73e14a9f8512a3d18c4ac; fe5e80365174bc6d654adaee41295c7a0cc307d8; 826c3a9c508f1759ce08b4f623851d60dc8e88c8; 98ca82c94c15d9ce8b5b5ca85fbb271c0d3f355f; 0b820313cd767a5b18fb1dbc88348ae3b5ad166a; f08df8ff4e467114bde29d1e30021259e21dc4a8; a5bf02902402d6c7b3c3791d01cd4c621d390547; aabf9576a6be8f9f8706686a45f34f68ee7a15d5; d35ab2847c1b5dde5ab2205614eb474b5b02ed40; d43b411f1e017799d50943188e02f5111632213f; dbad5d098a42d1abc6e173f13109fbcf7b09bacb; ca1dbc700b753312e6c46f9dfbaa96c97ee9e39f; 91f22667ed0e14c87de298e33d004d1c04f8ea13; fb9e32915d1171eaf7288f4ca1dc451334dcac4b; 9509cffff4392aec2abc44ace9b5411233c5bc95; e9d895c92be531fe7f982d18f50c18969c20ac3a; 84254c35c1e6384d1795beeab486dfe0ad6d04f1; 97503950972975bb885cf1055dbcdf4969c04452; be04ab4f218fd9ff8a7a6f82945be296b11d3ca5; fc3f0c5e5b22085551db9e1fcae53a394caad28e; 78b98ed9ad6398b5b59fc7e2a6ced425857fbb00; 855f73d6534fcac7f885730a67eee07ff4d4ea3b; 3a606a542fd97e03edf461f4089e751f277e7b44; 8c241b4e835f7bf25aaff1540aee99d85f954bbb; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; 92e833d5ae4ba2c876f3c8424afa4cb8247df04f; c0a7c310162d6acef48ae75405d33347fac04086; 17d01d94092942d99625e2df0614a03977f64960; b307d55ba07058d6183991d2d2a81b340d558186; 812970e36bf244a02462ab8fbb99ee2ead1a75d6; 1acd90fc1f14c16fbd77aac51183a86fdbf1edd5; bcc3d1b60193b0459a5fbd776c944365d8dfc05f; 4269f09af992baa178f79656ad5b5d3557d9c2b4; 42926b6bf92b37c0f267bb09b8e6b52bebfce5c2; b4c44d75a034860743c832422b265a533449fe7f; 294372a38650e845f389b037bc76c5a166cf6eae; 3754c7027756fd28756db7af2afb4be272488939; 393b13c77c66df9194addfafe0ef11cfd1796327; 7278b031ef2b4c14ea0afcdae1f38dac8d105fcf; 37a3bd7e6afee5a2ee44f382ff354c9ba1aa998f; 070eb63031af260d840534b33fd8385b7152fda6; 8414706415804a498d59154512f182733d0210bb; 4c677feae397eb040821e89c70e653f0a97ca247; 6f0c4dc0cfe925e130bf9fde3004a88b23c5eb7c; 8d25166936950cce588f96c826fd3d5fb75662ba; 0211f815a33dbd1f7e26a10b20dc6453adba80b9; 15aa65892e960a995107d31368751b9a29011f3d; 96caf70bb4d444f8f6841f7878447b61de2ea3f6; 39a77db7282569c6cf0fc6a3618f301d52ecb7f1; d97caa01343eaa8b9e5f1ee7b268ca1bd42a2b4b; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 212d6d8220a6e70aeab093a9e476e3ecb1fe3964; d988e5b57a13183b97eaaea4f41e642274a74f6e; 152b51181918ec3c912c902637e9161943f0389b; 7d87f3a123b7153f0122108ea8a4e8b71db1dad0; bbbe8f992ca7c982ea52b54663eaeaa93adf65ba; c216610872173061bea7de41bd712c5f1c04c946; 7e91540d55df63c5ced2387c07edd47759e0c730; 18867ef6b426e2d9c68cade3aa387948056141ba; 950343a3869613375c424c5885c6d30babe9cf32; 4faabb517c2b5b3fce38cba7f4da91268f3a14ea; dd8397290c1e4c7873a054c4ef7ae705dd8674b7; 1c8831d2ac1b0124f0a37718613f32d37090b239; fad39bb641b0c0c7b8f3aef899dd65d69ce167d6; 16b730b1ce7aef5827185808626e4a362d69b415; 9c48619f522a745364db5286b8ff0a8b0f24115f; 19156f17391fc8fe12076c01c5135613ae9fe69c; f475b4b9c8ff4b0f3542f5b6c6fa5ca4310baa6a; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 1f2ef203e6d017b565593d39eabad0027e74ae11; 20ab63eec9c4b98ec6f2d85d136894a9d493f010; d50458c350897b517ac409a568b941e13f071e76; bfda2fd9dcffa01a9132157801b37f78d1f74c3c; d2860a370a0386c57fecc4eef2e43779352fa410; e69dc1b16adc398c960e568a7cea3e351456bd72; 5560a68a854692323d9677011ce7919e787ac4a4; 2449e1d56a843cb6e280852d787143479d776ce6; d273d69cbcde78c5901b8a96009a897a9e32d9c1; 777946aba09b3b4c5b007af1ab8b0d22a126964d,BMC Genomics,17,
56260c3dfb3882f785a220a693afd918838b6182,Crescendo: A Protein Sequence Database Search Engine for Tandem Mass Spectra,"AbstractA search engine that discovers more peptides reliably is essential to the progress of the computational proteomics. We propose two new scoring functions (L- and P-scores), which aim to capture similar characteristics of a peptide-spectrum match (PSM) as Sequest and Comet do. Crescendo, introduced here, is a software program that implements these two scores for peptide identification. We applied Crescendo to test datasets and compared its performance with widely used search engines, including Mascot, Sequest, and Comet. The results indicate that Crescendo identifies a similar or larger number of peptides at various predefined false discovery rates (FDR). Importantly, it also provides a better separation between the true and decoy PSMs, warranting the future development of a companion post-processing filtering algorithm.

087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5,Two simple sufficient conditions for FDR control,"We show that the control of the false discovery rate (FDR) for a multiple testing procedure is implied by two coupled simple sufficient conditions. The first one, which we call ``self-consistency condition'', concerns the algorithm itself, and the second, called ``dependency control condition'' is related to the dependency assumptions on the $p$-value family. Many standard multiple testing procedures are self-consistent (e.g. step-up, step-down or step-up-down procedures), and we prove that the dependency control condition can be fulfilled when choosing correspondingly appropriate rejection functions, in three classical types of dependency: independence, positive dependency (PRDS) and unspecified dependency. As a consequence, we recover earlier results through simple and unifying proofs while extending their scope to several regards: weighted FDR, $p$-value reweighting, new family of step-up procedures under unspecified $p$-value dependency and adaptive step-up procedures. We give additional examples of other possible applications. This framework also allows for defining and studying FDR control for multiple testing procedures over a continuous, uncountable space of hypotheses.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Gilles Blanchard"", ids = ""145945278""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456"")",111e475c04b56740e347b9751c149a84c1262019; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; f46f16ec9ddb69dec6d594ccea38a51ea5e20312; ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0; 5e8ec9eb30801d15481794870726cc1c834bb286; aa95eaffacddcc1cde626b25be7739346873a1f6; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 4d442f793573153f93e2901617b97ca90098be5a; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930; ef4fd34d7cd9d5ad065367fd9954967500f5d334; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 037900248b1503269fce63b2dc17e06f57e63450; 6d3fb1482ea20a3d75d39c0147977e775c1af173; 2d9c75dbcd4b7d9fc6f82583521342ea63fbf925; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef; 733258b64e35d4fcdaf8ab82d340f3a386392947; 87d03baf74d37893c626e69569153ff21e1686c4; f2bab4dfaa096a86f826e7d28f670166b8fdd8a7; 00dd613e7585a67191197c25d6d6a0c83d2d0aef; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; fd4de5e69b3942e3ff28ed06f1722b0e17d5fadf; 5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22; 2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59; 4225126bdc2a75577fa6f9ea67d0b4617773c44b; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; 48f8aa8a5c1491e77ff07b6d6ce2953c105dd770; d3fbc69e2b7ed7d184bb1b6ffbb5ea370319816e; 15b4192d8024b0ef6db4d82ae131289e6e36b701; 3d4b179a8ea1e7ed76a6d77e232c3d1e2695f959; 5422a2a99870e82ba91ebfb26e8b6ed2227470bc; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; be0eedf4bf34549369f42a24bec5754d01c97433; 7e504bfb29d24a97e374b90c0f9ce4bdf1bcc68b; 0f4ff4f1b6d60b754cda6eb9b082d83c1bf8831a; 9dba9654165f306c652ce82e61003d3c74b9bb15; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; e3159d253d3dc7497604a54f1a907afddbae2fee; 782b5102432d341384d5a58590ee1ad30bf0cbc5; 9b7944d85138c4b6a31f667a6f1c585b8e97cf7c; 2aa5df22b25edfdf938c11177b36038c825bf391; be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823; 8324fcd6937862c8300ae822eaeb8915676c058a; 52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb; ba3e48e6b0104758db32cd0aa6397e4abd9f75f5; a3dfc5ae1aea7add5a8ee2d42b27dacd9ad41d31,28370c28fd706be8ff9d8be36722f3a6661fdf80; 60b34d6721c7fd8237de116314e51a8347f2c1ac; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7414b5d0c96169599d97a02ac276ef8de77fca5e; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 7c8ab4825e0d59ab38c0790a8ca7ee81edfe9e4b; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; eb203656d2da20402343c13b1c0c64e71e6e838a; bd53ebf7e28d0ee4d6904be1875c5a931d5b28bf; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 84dca92e839864988a56c439bb7e4f94adebf7b0; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; ea46d5e259e75d4822789b02689b8df70ef9329f; a79bbdc6f404f0d7ea18b8fa3dfab7ebbfd5bfcb; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; 8525b42c8c7e1f55621aa233da3da4895caecc96; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643,Electronic Journal of Statistics,2,963-992

Altered White Matter Connectivity in Patients with Schizophrenia Using Public Neuroimaging Data from Schizconnect,"AbstractBackgroundSeveral studies have produced a large body of evidence for white matter abnormalities related to schizophrenia. The literature has yet to achieve a state of consistency and reproducibility, and reported low integrity of white matter tracts vary between studies. Whole brain image study with large sample size is needed to address this issue. We investigated white matter integrity in connections between regions of interests (ROI) in the same hemisphere in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls with public neuroimaging data from SchizConnect (http://schizconnect.org).MethodsA final data set was consisted of 129 healthy controls and 122 schizophrenia patients. For each diffusion weighted image (DWI), a two-tensor full-brain tractography was performed, and DWI images were parcellated by processing and registering the T1 images with FreeSurfer and the Advanced Normalization Tools. We extracted a total of 36 tracts in the both hemisphere connecting ROIs in the same hemisphere with white matter query language. We compared means of diffusion measures between patients and controls, and evaluated correlations with Letter-number sequencing (LNS) test, Vocabulary test, letter fluency test, category fluency test, and trails A of the Trail Making Test (TMT). The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used to correct for multiple comparisons.ResultsWe found a significant RD and TR increase of the left thalamo-occipital tracts and the right uncinate fascicle (UF), and a significant RD increase of the right middle longitudinal fascicle (MDLF), and the right superior longitudinal fascicle (SLF) ii in schizophrenia. There were correlations between the TR in the left thalamo-occipital tracts and letter fluency test, and the RD in the right SLF ii and LNS test, which did not survive after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionThese results indicate widespread abnormalities of white matter fiber tracts in schizophrenia, contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Sung Woo Joo"", ids = ""10673848""); list(name = ""Woon Yoon"", ids = ""144697818""); list(name = ""Seung-Hyun Shon"", ids = ""7885572""); list(name = ""Saetbyeol Chat"", ids = ""40899529""); list(name = ""Jung Seop Lee"", ids = ""48174789"")",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,44,S391 - S391
bdadeab0460d0e275caba29d7bdd1a6095904614,Investigating effects of epigenetic modulation in acute myeloid leukaemia,"Abstract Background Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is one of the commonest haemopoietic cancers; despite intensive clinical trial developments there has been little change in survival over the past 20 years. A major focus of research is the identification of less toxic regimens that offer the possibility of response above that of supportive care. Epigenetic therapies, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine, offer a novel approach to the treatment of this disease. Despite increasing use in the clinic, the mechansim by which azacitidine regulates gene transcription remains unclearâ€”in particular, whether induction of gene expression change is directly methylation-dependent or secondary to indirect downstream effects. We aimed to investigate the genome-wide effects of azacitidine on DNA methylation and gene transcription in vitro. Methods Using an acute leukaemia cell line (OCI-AML3), we compared methylation and gene expression in OCI-AML3 cells treated with and without azacitidine. For the best possible comparison, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA-Seq. Using these data, we aimed to identify the molecular variables that determine a gene's responsiveness to azacitidine. Findings We found that a low dose of azacitidine, which resulted in DNA hypomethylation but was not toxic enough to acutely arrest DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, induced widespread methylation loss, of about 50%, across the genome. This demethylation was uniform, rather than selectively targeted, across all genomic features. Hence, the absolute loss of methylation was proportional to the starting density of methylation in a given region of the genome. Azacitidine induced significant gene expression change in 3Â·4% of all genes with both losses and gains of gene expression (false discovery rate r 2 =âˆ’0Â·252, p=1Â·46â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10 âˆ’14 ). In line with this finding, a high level of gene expression in untreated cells also correlated with azacitidine-induced alteration in gene expression. Neither of these variables was specifically associated with either upregulation or downregulation of gene expression. Interpretation We found an inconsistency between the widespread extent of DNA methylation loss and the limited gene expression changes in this model. Therefore, the simple view that DNA methyltransferase inhibitor-induced demethylation at CpG island promoters is primarily responsible for reactivation of previously silenced genes could be an oversimplification. We conclude that azacitidine interacts with other, as yet uncharacterised, factors that contribute to transcriptional changes in hypomethylated CpG island containing genes. This observation provides a clinical rationale for the combination of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors with other epigenetic agents whose function could be synergistically exploited to modify the transcriptional profile of the leukaemia genome.

51251c45ea4f91f23cfad48ee4a30def3e75328c,NPS: scoring and evaluating the statistical significance of peptidic natural productâ€“spectrum matches,"MOTIVATION
Peptidic natural products (PNPs) are considered a promising compound class that has many applications in medicine. Recently developed mass spectrometry-based pipelines are transforming PNP discovery into a high-throughput technology. However, the current computational methods for PNP identification via database search of mass spectra are still in their infancy and could be substantially improved.


RESULTS
Here we present NPS, a statistical learning-based approach for scoring PNP-spectrum matches. We incorporated NPS into two leading PNP discovery tools and benchmarked them on millions of natural product mass spectra. The results demonstrate more than 45% increase in the number of identified spectra and 20% more found PNPs at a false discovery rate of 1%.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
NPS is available as a command line tool and as a web application at http://cab.spbu.ru/software/NPS.

7ffed3c14f85ebfbe7384f0a6efb86fd7fd9756f,Computational RNomics of Drosophilids,"BackgroundRecent experimental and computational studies have provided overwhelming evidence for a plethora of diverse transcripts that are unrelated to protein-coding genes. One subclass consists of those RNAs that require distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their biological function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns of sequence conservation characteristic for positive selection on RNA secondary structure.The deep-sequencing of 12 drosophilid species coordinated by the NHGRI provides an ideal data set of comparative computational approaches to determine those genomic loci that code for evolutionarily conserved RNA motifs. This class of loci includes the majority of the known small ncRNAs as well as structured RNA motifs in mRNAs. We report here on a genome-wide survey using RNAz.ResultsWe obtain 16 000 high quality predictions among which we recover the majority of the known ncRNAs. Taking a pessimistically estimated false discovery rate of 40% into account, this implies that at least some ten thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show the hallmarks of stabilizing selection action of RNA structure, and hence are most likely functional at the RNA level. A subset of RNAz predictions overlapping with TRF1 and BRF binding sites [Isogai et al., EMBO J. 26: 79â€“89 (2007)], which are plausible candidates of Pol III transcripts, have been studied in more detail. Among these sequences we identify several ""clusters"" of ncRNA candidates with striking structural similarities.ConclusionThe statistical evaluation of the RNAz predictions in comparison with a similar analysis of vertebrate genomes [Washietl et al., Nat. Biotech. 23: 1383â€“1390 (2005)] shows that qualitatively similar fractions of structured RNAs are found in introns, UTRs, and intergenic regions. The intergenic RNA structures, however, are concentrated much more closely around known protein-coding loci, suggesting that flies have significantly smaller complement of independent structured ncRNAs compared to mammals.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dominic Rose"", ids = ""47020655""); list(name = ""JÃ¶rg HackermÃ¼ller"", ids = ""1892926""); list(name = ""Stefan Washietl"", ids = ""2192601""); list(name = ""Kristin Reiche"", ids = ""145726148""); list(name = ""Jana Hertel"", ids = ""2434024""); list(name = ""Sven FindeiÃŸ"", ids = ""2767463""); list(name = ""Peter F.

72bc491cfbdc71e1fcf4f36274eca926a2ac235c,An evaluation of statistical differential analysis methods in single-cell RNA-seq data,"Background: Single-cell RNA-Seq is gaining popularity in recent years. Compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq allows the gene expression being measured within individual cells instead of mean gene expression levels across all cells in the sample. Thus, cell-to-cell variation of gene expressions could be examined. Gene differential expression analysis remains the major purpose in most Single-cell RNA-Seq experiments and many tools have been developed in recent years to conduct gene differential expression analysis for Single-cell RNA-Seq data. Results: Through simulation studies and real data examples, we evaluate the performance of five open-source popular methods used for gene differential expression analysis in single-cell RNA-seq data. The five methods include DEsingle (Zero-inflated negative binomial model), Linnorm (Empirical Bayes method on transformed count data using the limma package), Monocle2 (An approximate Chi-Square likelihood ration test), MAST (A generalized linear hurdle model), and DESeq2 (A generalized linear model with empirical Bayes approach). We assessed the false discovery rate (FDR) control, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve for all five methods under different sample sizes, distribution assumptions, and proportions of zeros in the data. Conclusions: We found the MAST and Linnorm performs relatively better than other methods with higher AUROC, when there are some proportion of zeros in the single-cell RNA-seq data after filtering. However, when the proportions of zeros are close to zero, the DESingle, Linnorm, and DESeq2 performs relatively better than others with higher AUROC. When sample size increases to 100 in each group, MAST shows the best performance with the highest AUROC regardless of the proportion of zeros in the data.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Dong-Mei Li"", ids = ""48108982"")",,,,,
fe64ae5d50eb62a894c96eab85afedec7b9d2430,Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) Mapping in Puerto Rican Children,"BACKGROUND
Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) have been identified using tissue or cell samples from diverse human populations, thus enhancing our understanding of regulation of gene expression. However, few studies have attempted to identify eQTL in racially admixed populations such as Hispanics.


METHODS
We performed a systematic eQTL study to identify regulatory variants of gene expression in whole blood from 121 Puerto Rican children with (n = 63) and without (n = 58) asthma. Genome-wide genotyping was conducted using the Illumina Omni2.5M Bead Chip, and gene expression was assessed using the Illumina HT-12 microarray. After completing quality control, we performed a pair-wise genome analysis of ~15 K transcripts and ~1.3 M SNPs for both local and distal effects. This analysis was conducted under a regression framework adjusting for age, gender and principal components derived from both genotypic and mRNA data. We used a false discovery rate (FDR) approach to identify significant eQTL signals, which were next compared to top eQTL signals from existing eQTL databases. We then performed a pathway analysis for our top genes.


RESULTS
We identified 36,720 local pairs in 3,391 unique genes and 1,851 distal pairs in 446 unique genes at FDR <0.05, corresponding to unadjusted P values lower than 1.5x10-4 and 4.5x10-9, respectively. A significant proportion of genes identified in our study overlapped with those identified in previous studies. We also found an enrichment of disease-related genes in our eQTL list.


CONCLUSIONS
We present results from the first eQTL study in Puerto Rican children, who are members of a unique Hispanic cohort disproportionately affected with asthma, prematurity, obesity and other common diseases. Our study confirmed eQTL signals identified in other ethnic groups, while also detecting additional eQTLs unique to our study population. The identified eQTLs will help prioritize findings from future genome-wide association studies in Puerto Ricans.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Chen"", ids = ""38787223""); list(name = ""John M.

e89fb3a2e6ee87eb172886c1a4114d91ff4e5a7b,Identification of key regulators of pancreatic cancer progression through multidimensional systems-level analysis,"BackgroundPancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer with dismal prognosis, urgently necessitating better biomarkers to improve therapeutic options and early diagnosis. Traditional approaches of biomarker detection that consider only one aspect of the biological continuum like gene expression alone are limited in their scope and lack robustness in identifying the key regulators of the disease. We have adopted a multidimensional approach involving the cross-talk between the omics spaces to identify key regulators of disease progression.MethodsMultidimensional domain-specific disease signatures were obtained using rank-based meta-analysis of individual omics profiles (mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation) related to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). These domain-specific PDAC signatures were integrated to identify genes that were affected across multiple dimensions of omics space in PDAC (genes under multiple regulatory controls, GMCs). To further pin down the regulators of PDAC pathophysiology, a systems-level network was generated from knowledge-based interaction information applied to the above identified GMCs. Key regulators were identified from the GMC network based on network statistics and their functional importance was validated using gene set enrichment analysis and survival analysis.ResultsRank-based meta-analysis identified 5391 genes, 109 miRNAs and 2081 methylation-sites significantly differentially expressed in PDAC (false discovery rateâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). Bimodal integration of meta-analysis signatures revealed 1150 and 715 genes regulated by miRNAs and methylation, respectively. Further analysis identified 189 altered genes that are commonly regulated by miRNA and methylation, hence considered GMCs. Systems-level analysis of the scale-free GMCs network identified eight potential key regulator hubs, namely E2F3, HMGA2, RASA1, IRS1, NUAK1, ACTN1, SKI and DLL1, associated with important pathways driving cancer progression. Survival analysis on individual key regulators revealed that higher expression of IRS1 and DLL1 and lower expression of HMGA2, ACTN1 and SKI were associated with better survival probabilities.ConclusionsIt is evident from the results that our hierarchical systems-level multidimensional analysis approach has been successful in isolating the converging regulatory modules and associated key regulatory molecules that are potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer progression.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Deepa Rajamani"", ids = ""4656627""); list(name = ""Manoj K.

e93a55059fdb9cfa6e88d05eff26b4541e2cbcfc,"Deceptive combined effects of short allele dominance and stuttering: an example with Ixodes scapularis, the main vector of Lyme disease in the U.S.A.","Null alleles, short allele dominance (SAD), and stuttering increase the perceived relative inbreeding of individuals and subpopulations as measured by Wrightâ€™s FIS and FST. Ascertainment bias, due to such amplifying problems are usually caused by inaccurate primer design (if developed from a different species or a distant population), poor DNA quality, low DNA concentration, or a combination of some or all these sources of inaccuracy. When combined, these issues can increase the correlation between polymorphism at concerned loci and, consequently, of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between those. In this note, we studied an original microsatellite data set generated by analyzing nine loci in Ixodes scapularis ticks from the eastern U.S.A. To detect null alleles and SAD we used correlation methods and variation measures. To detect stuttering, we evaluated heterozygote deficit between alleles displaying a single repeat difference. We demonstrated that an important proportion of loci affected by amplification problems (one with null alleles, two with SAD and three with stuttering) lead to highly significant heterozygote deficits (FIS=0.1, p-value<0.0001). This occurred together with an important proportion (22%) of pairs of loci in significant LD, two of which were still significant after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction, and some variation in the measurement of population subdivision across loci (Wrightâ€™s FST). This suggested a strong Wahlund effect and/or selection at several loci. By finding small peaks corresponding to previously disregarded larger alleles in some homozygous profiles for loci with SAD and by pooling alleles close in size for loci with stuttering, we generated an amended dataset. Except for one locus with null alleles and another still displaying a modest SAD, the analyses of the corrected dataset revealed a significant excess of heterozygotes (FIS=-0.07 as expected in dioecious and strongly subdivided populations, with a more reasonable proportion (19%) of pairs of loci characterized by significant LD, none of which stayed significant after the FDR procedure. Strong subdivision was also confirmed by the standardized FSTâ€² corrected for null alleles (FSTâ€™=0.19) and small effective subpopulation sizes (Ne=7).",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Thierry De MeeÃ»s"", ids = ""2363812""); list(name = ""Cynthia Chan"", ids = ""49721046""); list(name = ""John M.

b0a15733c18f2d7056770ae0f057d47915405415,OP0194 Dna Methylation in Relation to Arthritis Persistency: an Epigenome Wide-Study,"Background Persistency of arthritis is the hallmark of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Thus far the mechanisms underlying arthritis persistency are largely unknown. In other diseases, it has been shown that longstanding inflammation may induce changes in DNA methylation, that DNA methylation occurs very early in disease development and that DNA methylation is associated with the disease outcome. Since aberrant DNA methylation is passed over to cells it can provide â€œepigenetic memoryâ€. We hypothesized that changes in DNA methylation occur early in arthritis development and are associated with persistency of arthritis. The present study aimed to evaluate the latter hypothesis. Objectives To identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with arthritis persistency in patients presenting with early undifferentiated arthritis (UA). Methods 74 patients with UA were studied for persistency of arthritis during a median follow-up duration of 42 months (IQR 36-56). Persistent arthritis was defined as the absence of DMARD-free sustained remission (no arthritis for at least one year after cessation of DMARD-therapy). Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were extracted at the baseline visit (median symptom duration 19 weeks (IQR 9-31)) when no treatment was yet started. The use of these early samples reduced the risk that the methylation status was influenced by effects of longstanding inflammation or of treatment. Methylation was determined using the Illumina 450K methylation array. None of the samples were excluded after quality control. Analyses were done using Cox proportional hazard models. To account for multiple testing the false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at 5%. Results During the median follow-up duration of 42 months (IQR 36-56) 50 patients (67.6%) had persistent arthritis and 24 patients (32.4%) achieved DMARD-free sustained remission after a median duration of 31 months (IQR 14-38). After correction for multiple testing, no DMP was significantly associated with arthritis persistency. The lowest p-value was 3.14Ã—10-6 for a difference of 2.2% in methylation levels between patients with and without persistency; this concernced cg17440386 that is located in between SHANK2 and DHCR7. Conclusions In this first EWAS on arthritis persistency, no significant association was observed. This may indicate that the present study was not large enough, or that potential signals were blurred though heterogeneity in cell compositions, or that DNA methylation does not play a major role in arthritis becoming chronic. In addition, more advanced analysis approaches utilizing methylation patterns and genome annotations may prove to be more powerful than our current GWAS-like focussing on DMPs. Larger studies in selected cell populations are needed to determine the value of methylation in persistency of arthritis. Disclosure of Interest H. van Steenbergen: None declared, R.

However, current pathway association analysis approaches fail to consider tissue-specificity. Results: We developed a tissue-specific pathway interaction enrichment analysis algorithm (TPIEA). TPIEA was applied to two large Caucasian and Chinese genome-wide association study summary datasets of bone mineral density (BMD). TPIEA identified several significant pathways for BMD [false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05], such as KEGG FOCAL ADHESION and KEGG AXON GUIDANCE, which had been demonstrated to be involved in the development of osteoporosis. We also compared the performance of TPIEA and classical pathway enrichment analysis, and TPIEA presented improved performance in recognizing disease relevant pathways. TPIEA may help to fill the gap of classic pathway association analysis approaches by considering tissue specificity.

Nine-week-old male Zucker diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats were fed a chow diet supplemented with 3 g LA per kg diet or pair fed for 2 wk. At the end of the trial, high-quality RNA was extracted from the liver and epididymal fat and subjected to transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Results showed a substantially higher number of differentially expressed genes [DEG, false discovery rate adjusted P â‰¤ 0.05 and absolute log2 (fold change) â‰¥ 1] in the liver (110 genes) vs. epididymal fat (10 genes). Most epididymal fat DEG were also differentially expressed in liver and shared directionality of change. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these transcripts revealed significant enrichment of GO categories related to immune response, stress response, lipid metabolism, and carboxylic acid metabolic processes. Of interest, interferon-related genes involved in defense against microorganisms and innate immune response were induced by LA. Lipid metabolism-related transcript changes observed in LA-fed animals included downregulation of lipogenic genes (Pnpla3, Pnpla5, Elovl6, Acly, Gpam, and Aacs) and concomitant upregulation of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acid metabolic processes (Acot1, Acot2, Acsf2, and Crat). Transcriptional changes were accompanied by the lowering of abdominal adiposity and blood triacylglycerol levels.

b87a3e9a4c96475cb8bd7858f4d302fe4d4e1115,Constructing a Boolean implication network to study the interactions between environmental factors and OTUs,"AbstractMining relationships between microbes and the environment they live in are crucial to understand the intrinsic mechanisms that govern cycles of carbon, nitrogen and energy in a microbial community. Building upon next-generation sequencing technology, the selective capture of 16S rRNA genes has enabled the study of co-occurrence patterns of microbial species from the viewpoint of complex networks, yielding successful descriptions of phenomena exhibited in a microbial community. However, since the effects of such environmental factors as temperature or soil conditions on microbes are complex, reliance on the analysis of co-occurrence networks alone cannot elucidate such complicated effects underlying microbial communities. In this study, we apply a statistical method, which is called Boolean implications for metagenomic studies (BIMS) for extracting Boolean implications (IF-THEN relationships) to capture the effects of environmental factors on microbial species based on 16S rRNA sequencing data. We first demonstrate the power and effectiveness of BIMS through comprehensive simulation studies and then apply it to a 16S rRNA sequencing dataset of real marine microbes. Based on a total of 6,514 pairwise relationships identified at a low false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01, we construct a Boolean implication network between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and environmental factors. Relationships in this network are supported by literature, and, most importantly, they bring biological insights into the effects of environmental factors on microbes. We next apply BIMS to detect three-way relationships and show the possibility of using this strategy to explain more complex relationships within a microbial community.

697563e805d5b2d426e92bae43309ad52851dc7f,Optimal Use of Conservation and Accessibility Filters in MicroRNA Target Prediction,"It is generally accepted that filtering microRNA (miRNA) target predictions by conservation or by accessibility can reduce the false discovery rate. However, these two strategies are usually not exploited in a combined and flexible manner. Here, we introduce PACCMIT, a flexible method that filters miRNA binding sites by their conservation, accessibility, or both. The improvement in performance obtained with each of these three filters is demonstrated on the prediction of targets for both i) highly and ii) weakly conserved miRNAs, i.e., in two scenarios in which the miRNA-target interactions are subjected to different evolutionary pressures. We show that in the first scenario conservation is a better filter than accessibility (as both sensitivity and precision are higher among the top predictions) and that the combined filter improves performance of PACCMIT even further. In the second scenario, on the other hand, the accessibility filter performs better than both the conservation and combined filters, suggesting that the site conservation is not equally effective in rejecting false positive predictions for all miRNAs. Regarding the quality of the ranking criterion proposed by Robins and Press and used in PACCMIT, it is shown that top ranking interactions correspond to more downregulated proteins than do the lower ranking interactions. Comparison with several other target prediction algorithms shows that the ranking of predictions provided by PACCMIT is at least as good as the ranking generated by other conservation-based methods and considerably better than the energy-based ranking used in other accessibility-based methods.",2012,Physics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ray M.

5a12e43b0dd63fa15458c2e366eebe34fa312d8e,Characterizing the Escherichia coli O157:H7 Proteome Including Protein Associations with Higher Order Assemblies,"BACKGROUND
The recent outbreak of severe infections with Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O104:H4 highlights the need to understand horizontal gene transfer among E. coli strains, identify novel virulence factors and elucidate their pathogenesis. Quantitative shotgun proteomics can contribute to such objectives, allowing insights into the part of the genome translated into proteins and the connectivity of biochemical pathways and higher order assemblies of proteins at the subcellular level.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We examined protein profiles in cell lysate fractions of STEC strain 86-24 (serotype O157:H7), following growth in cell culture or bacterial isolation from intestines of infected piglets, in the context of functionally and structurally characterized biochemical pathways of E. coli. Protein solubilization in the presence of Triton X-100, EDTA and high salt was followed by size exclusion chromatography into the approximate M(r) ranges greater than 280 kDa, 280-80 kDa and 80-10 kDa. Peptide mixtures resulting from these and the insoluble fraction were analyzed by quantitative 2D-LC-nESI-MS/MS. Of the 2521 proteins identified at a 1% false discovery rate, representing 47% of all predicted E. coli O157:H7 gene products, the majority of integral membrane proteins were enriched in the high M(r) fraction. Hundreds of proteins were enriched in a M(r) range higher than that predicted for a monomer supporting their participation in protein complexes. The insoluble STEC fraction revealed enrichment of aggregation-prone proteins, including many that are part of large structure/function entities such as the ribosome, cytoskeleton and O-antigen biosynthesis cluster.


SIGNIFICANCE
Nearly all E. coli O157:H7 proteins encoded by prophage regions were expressed at low abundance levels or not detected.

618a1d21208572b09e97921c7708c9cffa542f5f,A User ' s Guide to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements,"The mission of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to enable the scientific and medical communities to interpret the human genome sequence and apply it to understand human biology and improve health. The ENCODE Consortium is integrating multiple technologies and approaches in a collective effort to discover and define the functional elements encoded in the human genome, including genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, together with their attendant chromatin states and DNA methylation patterns. In the process, standards to ensure high-quality data have been implemented, and novel algorithms have been developed to facilitate analysis. Data and derived results are made available through a freely accessible database. Here we provide an overview of the project and the resources it is generating and illustrate the application of ENCODE data to interpret the human genome.

f61bb0f24da6dbe283f5a3887f53750159496eef,Prediction of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in Stage II/III gastric cancer treatment based on comprehensive gene expression analysis,"Studies to identify predictive biomarkers of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 after gastrectomy in Stage II/III gastric cancer patients have been done; however, more clarity and understanding are needed. Our aim in the present study was to identify biomarkers predicting benefit due to S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy using comprehensive gene expression analysis. We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 and 46 patients not receiving S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy after gastrectomy for gastric cancer treatment between January 2014 and December 2016. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on the gene expression data obtained using cDNA microarray. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using thresholds of absolute fold changes ofâ€‰>â€‰4.0 and a false discovery rate P value ofâ€‰<â€‰0.01. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and GO network visualization were performed using the ClueGO app in Cytoscape. Hierarchical clustering analysis in patients treated with S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy revealed two clusters with favorable and unfavorable survival outcomes. We identified 147 upregulated DEGs and 192 downregulated DEGs in the favorable outcome group. GO analysis to identify significantly upregulated genes showed enrichment in immune-related genes and GO terms. Upregulation of these immune-related genes was not associated with survival in patients not receiving S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy. The upregulation and enrichment of immune-related genes and GO terms may be predictive biomarkers in patients who would benefit from adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy to treat Stage II/III gastric cancer.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kenichi Nakamura"", ids = ""50080454""); list(name = ""Keiichi Hatakeyama"", ids = ""49934452""); list(name = ""Kenichiro Furukawa"", ids = ""21045115""); list(name = ""Keiichi Fujiya"", ids = ""13907270""); list(name = ""Satoshi Kamiya"", ids = ""153732350""); list(name = ""Makoto Hikage"", ids = ""4958271""); list(name = ""Yutaka Tanizawa"", ids = ""2340557""); list(name = ""Etsuro Bando"", ids = ""46218004""); list(name = ""Keiichi Ohshima"", ids = ""143978253""); list(name = ""Kenichi Urakami"", ids = ""40448198""); list(name = ""Nozomu Machida"", ids = ""15362590""); list(name = ""Hirofumi Yasui"", ids = ""66571664""); list(name = ""Ken Yamaguchi"", ids = ""26338100""); list(name = ""Masanori Terashima"", ids = ""34747609"")",,83ab5cf89399bca5449f4a7baf1b1b3c2e1178c7; 5261cd1cc071f1ccea712f7a258167b3bede76e1; cba2dd131ee846b02111b320216e7a35acbc0c47; 36d56902080dce6871e0270993f7c5fce9c2af44; 4f73fefa5876570fc29299589e4b609c083d240d; 13be3028b3c1f2addbb5c0b040a81f60829be669; 5acadf16015bb282aee6d331d9bfc2b6848c3af8; 1eb262b8016514f8a84edac7b79c797e143057f6; de71daf7d6e731a9d26ebc445b973067fa7551d8; 6df9a02d88b389614afded513f3bc5943d393e0f; e2843e9c5fc8609a17c7c7d8ee225648b74098c4; 22b4fc0bd039037cc903eb1c41fe851066289e0a; 6670caa4b9d8d48d7bbec0fa09c0e1718607ead7; 89d30992776d6903b75a4371c8ff4b44f570a299; f0e31a6556cf2258162ade9deb10092aa9a65629; 551210cd11c8655e187ef63a81fa9005b2b7ec33; c9b45d66b2b6805d94bba1d48f4fd5c3f7d16abb; 6d4107d1fecdaadc4f4dd5f4cc030ab05b0cde30; ebcb0b430676ed1a18d172c90ed361eb85359007; c4789474009b645618ed2ce6d0a050f05bcf1581; f8ce7d7682827a550f1d91a2f8882dc3f938c4b1; b84bc94550d5eb3f0ab9a51aafefdd0cff1d6e99; e7b3613e49bf4c4718005e561d86e701f8f00b93; c0b1bff4916a1d98cd618f60647313d96aedbeb3; 19274c13baaeaa8610fc9996a460e3106665ae8d; d5a20f2849c7fbb67dbdd341775d498b9d15e149; c0450f920c178d25e7707fa00432516fa6a96ce5; e292fb103f5b98aaa9ddf826317d7da88a3595df,Gastric Cancer,,1 - 11
3825877534ce34bd8416e058fe7769602ca7e160,A technically detailed and pragmatic protocol for quantitative serum proteomics using iTRAQ.,"Blood is recognised as a highly important source of disease-related biomarkers, and proteomic approaches for identifying novel blood-borne biomarkers are in demand. The complexity and dynamic protein concentration range of plasma/serum however complicates the analysis process. A number of strategies for simplification of blood prior to proteomic analysis have been developed. In addition, methods for quantifying the levels of proteins in samples, such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) are emerging. However, the successful application of these procedures is not always straightforward and technical hurdles must be overcome. Here we provide a technically detailed working protocol for iTRAQ-based quantification of serum proteins following immunodepletion of high abundance proteins. To improve the number of proteins identified and quantified we have introduced several modifications to the standard iTRAQ protocol. We report identifications of 217 proteins (5773 peptides) with a false discovery rate of 1% or 254 proteins with 95% confidence, respectively. Relative quantification data were obtained for 234 (95% confidence) serum proteins, including species present in the concentration range of tissue leakage factors. The samples described here relate to pancreatic cancer; however the protocol can be applied to serum from other control or disease types.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah Tonack"", ids = ""49816003""); list(name = ""Mark Aspinall-Oâ\200\231Dea"", ids = ""1398294239""); list(name = ""Rosalind Jenkins"", ids = ""145466794""); list(name = ""Victoria Elliot"", ids = ""48397930""); list(name = ""Seonaid Murray"", ids = ""1406006130""); list(name = ""Catherine S.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), an epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression, can affect the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. However, few epidemiological studies have examined the impact of PM on inflammation-related miRNAs and their target mRNAs, especially among vulnerable population. We recruited 160 and 113 children from areas with different PM level in Jinan, China. We measured benzo[a]pyrene-r-7,t-8,t-9,c-10-tetrahydotetrol-albumin (BPDE-Alb) adducts in serum and the expression of 5 candidate miRNAs involved in inflammation regulation and 7 pro-inflammatory genes predicted to be their targets in leukocytes. Generally, children in the polluted area had higher miRNAs and lower mRNAs expression than those in the control area. An interquartile increase of BPDE-Alb adducts was associated with 12.66 %, 14.13 %, and 12.76 % higher of let-7a, miR-146a-5p, and miR-155-5p, as well as 21.61 %, 20.16 %, and 12.49 % lower of IL-6, CXCL8, and TLR2 mRNAs at false discovery rate<0.05, respectively. Additionally, let-7a, miR-146a-5p, and miR-155-5p were found to mediate the associations of BPDE-Alb adducts with IL-6 and/or TLR2 expression.

dd6bfc9d0de95c2786238ae99641c0c1f7ecbd75,Transcriptional genomics associates FOX transcription factors with human heart failure.,"BACKGROUND
Specific transcription factors (TFs) modulate cardiac gene expression in murine models of heart failure, but their relevance in human subjects remains untested. We developed and applied a computational approach called transcriptional genomics to test the hypothesis that a discrete set of cardiac TFs is associated with human heart failure.


METHODS AND RESULTS
RNA isolates from failing (n=196) and nonfailing (n=16) human hearts were hybridized with Affymetrix HU133A arrays, and differentially expressed heart failure genes were determined. TF binding sites overrepresented in the -5-kb promoter sequences of these heart failure genes were then determined with the use of public genome sequence databases. Binding sites for TFs identified in murine heart failure models (MEF2, NKX, NF-AT, and GATA) were significantly overrepresented in promoters of human heart failure genes (P<0.002; false discovery rate 2% to 4%). In addition, binding sites for FOX TFs showed substantial overrepresentation in both advanced human and early murine heart failure (P<0.002 and false discovery rate <4% for each). A role for FOX TFs was supported further by expression of FOXC1, C2, P1, P4, and O1A in failing human cardiac myocytes at levels similar to established hypertrophic TFs and by abundant FOXP1 protein in failing human cardiac myocyte nuclei.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results provide the first evidence that specific TFs identified in murine models (MEF2, NKX, NFAT, and GATA) are associated with human heart failure. Moreover, these data implicate specific members of the FOX family of TFs (FOXC1, C2, P1, P4, and O1A) not previously suggested in heart failure pathogenesis. These findings provide a crucial link between animal models and human disease and suggest a specific role for FOX signaling in modulating the hypertrophic response of the heart to stress in humans.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sridhar Hannenhalli"", ids = ""1716201""); list(name = ""Mary E Putt"", ids = ""1956583""); list(name = ""Joan M Gilmore"", ids = ""39437685""); list(name = ""Junwen Wang"", ids = ""3246458""); list(name = ""Michael S.

0a5cb062647eab4e3fc7d6448e18f651cf867424,Voxel-based modeling and quantification of the proximal femur using inter-subject registration of quantitative CT images.,"We have developed a general framework which employs quantitative computed tomography (QCT) imaging and inter-subject image registration to model the three-dimensional structure of the hip, with the goal of quantifying changes in the spatial distribution of bone as it is affected by aging, drug treatment or mechanical unloading. We have adapted rigid and non-rigid inter-subject registration techniques to transform groups of hip QCT scans into a common reference space and to construct composite proximal femoral models. We have applied this technique to a longitudinal study of 16 astronauts who on average, incurred high losses of hip bone density during spaceflights of 4-6 months on the International Space Station (ISS). We compared the pre-flight and post-flight composite hip models, and observed the gradients of the bone loss distribution. We performed paired t-tests, on a voxel by voxel basis, corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR), and observed regions inside the proximal femur that showed the most significant bone loss. To validate our registration algorithm, we selected the 16 pre-flight scans and manually marked 4 landmarks for each scan. After registration, the average distance between the mapped landmarks and the corresponding landmarks in the target scan was 2.56 mm. The average error due to manual landmark identification was 1.70 mm.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wenjun Li"", ids = ""37348373""); list(name = ""Irina Kezele"", ids = ""3072133""); list(name = ""D.

c16c41b64f65a678795a9300a4020a3c9aa95515,Quantitative assessment of hit detection and confirmation in single and duplicate high-throughput screenings.,"The process of identifying active targets (hits) in high-throughput screening (HTS) usually involves 2 steps: first, removing or adjusting for systematic variation in the measurement process so that extreme values represent strong biological activity instead of systematic biases such as plate effect or edge effect and, second, choosing a meaningful cutoff on the calculated statistic to declare positive compounds. Both false-positive and false-negative errors are inevitable in this process. Common control or estimation of error rates is often based on an assumption of normal distribution of the noise. The error rates in hit detection, especially false-negative rates, are hard to verify because in most assays, only compounds selected in primary screening are followed up in confirmation experiments. In this article, the authors take advantage of a quantitative HTS experiment in which all compounds are tested 42 times over a wide range of 14 concentrations so true positives can be found through a dose-response curve. Using the activity status defined by dose curve, the authors analyzed the effect of various data-processing procedures on the sensitivity and specificity of hit detection, the control of error rate, and hit confirmation. A new summary score is proposed and demonstrated to perform well in hit detection and useful in confirmation rate estimation. In general, adjusting for positional effects is beneficial, but a robust test can prevent overadjustment. Error rates estimated based on normal assumption do not agree with actual error rates, for the tails of noise distribution deviate from normal distribution. However, false discovery rate based on empirically estimated null distribution is very close to observed false discovery proportion.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zhijin Wu"", ids = ""2142082""); list(name = ""Dongmei Liu"", ids = ""145159708""); list(name = ""Yunxia Sui"", ids = ""48184741"")",0b663b66cdf5d2ded3ea07e97aeb22258c9f5e0e; 67780e878d38adfdc3ddd03bbb3440a7cff79d7e; 8be03dc2f98f650d365044cef44a3b5484897967; a36192441db3d1a01d66788f2527912438c71973; d2861c4ebfd06fe40717f8aa364f2fe913d629e4; a63d851872c31a91cf814a84fc2af7f4fb15ce3d; 9180815892fa28c2c0311896cb7f46ec1beeb87c; 559ad66be03ac0121e5d370e3562823cf603497d; 23bb3a39469c90207b819e8f778840b63c01a094; 8ceb292f9f11bcff187fecc266d748a4029527d0; d3e4fd849e658acf3f12f247dca19140ce7b91a1; d1c90eaa28e0ed42b44c7782ae4dc5a4ac658405; e72d80fcf424f3c5cd023a0153609ea1cebab324; 2042b5554be4c38c3c8cbd8a6e58f1f95a21e27a; 551aee7c51367a9dca305d15e3bef647c5fbc014; 95f5d359d55fcba18348947e33c148e9eb0229b4; d4e4ac8377e25cfdf9083ad2711a3929ab13c1f4; 295d17c302c11e783defc08fd9c083320bba87f0; 180f9cfc5453d80e05963fa5ea77325b77527f7b; 57c36dcc247f73ad2d18da2a7dff4e4349ea96d9; 28ca3ef50240b2d0d7aeba448f0feb2039cade1c; 741f30c9f7c4ff7a4788d29011c02010f6ae1a2d; 58ba7796c1cc9f680db8e2b4a4d02b97491ce8d5; a4828c56275fe86ee63030da7954ee88e2b89e28,,Journal of biomolecular screening,13 2,"

35c317d4fcd81724c7615199324207967d23d0db,iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the lateral meristem developmental mechanism for branched spike development in tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.),"BackgroundSpike architecture mutants in tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L., 2nâ€‰=â€‰28, AABB) have a distinct morphology, with parts of the rachis node producing lateral meristems that develop into ramified spikelete (RSs) or four-rowed spikelete (FRSs). The genetic basis of RSs and FRSs has been analyzed, but little is known about the underlying developmental mechanisms of the lateral meristem. We used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to perform a quantitative proteomic analysis of immature spikes harvested from tetraploid near-isogenic lines of wheat with normal spikelete (NSs), FRSs, and RSs and investigated the molecular mechanisms of lateral meristem differentiation and development. This work provides valuable insight into the underlying functions of the lateral meristem and how it can produce differences in the branching of tetraploid wheat spikes.ResultsUsing an iTRAQ-based shotgun quantitation approach, 104 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) with <â€‰1% false discovery rate (FDR) and a 1.5-fold change (>â€‰1.50 orâ€‰<â€‰0.67) were identified by comparing FRS with NS and RS with NS genotypes. To determine the functions of the proteins, 38 co-expressed DAPs from the two groups were annotated using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analytical tools. We discovered that proteins involved in â€œpost-embryonic developmentâ€ and â€œmetabolic pathwaysâ€ such as carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism could be used to construct a developmentally associated network. Additionally, 6 out of 38 DAPs in the network were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the correlation coefficient between proteomics and qRT-PCR was 0.7005. These key genes and proteins were closely scrutinized and discussed.ConclusionsHere, we predicted that DAPs involved in â€œpost-embryonic developmentâ€ and â€œmetabolic pathwaysâ€ may be responsible for the spikelete architecture changes in FRS and RS. Furthermore, we discussed the potential function of several vital DAPs from GO and KEGG analyses that were closely related to histone modification, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, transcription factors, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism and heat shock proteins (HSPs).

f31840ba2a1909eab3bec35429971073782c7594,Serum proteomicsÂ guided discovery of predictive biomarkers of response to androgen ablation (AA) in prostate cancer.,"104 Background: Currently there are no serum predictive markers of response to AA. We used a proteomic based analytic approach to identify candidates.


METHODS
Serum from three non-localized prostate cancer cohorts was analyzed. The first included15 paired untreated hormone-sensitive ""pre-AA"" and 3-month ""post-AA"" specimens; the second included 10 ""early AA failure"" (median time to AA failure:11 months) and the third included 10 ""late AA failure"" specimens (median time to AA failure: 95 months). Proteomic analysis was performed with isobaric mass tags for relative and absolute quanititation (iTRAQ) analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Differentially expressed candidate proteins were identified by comparisons of (i) paired pre/post-AA proteomes and (ii) post-AA proteome with the combined AA failure cohorts at a False Discovery Rate of 0.2. ELISA assays were used to verify candidate markers in a second stored aliquot of first cohort specimens. This cohort was followed for AA failure. Association of post-AA ELISA levels of candidate markers with time to AA failure was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression, summarized as relative risk (RR) for AA failure.


RESULTS
Median PSA in pre/post-AA first cohort were 3.15 ng/ml and 0.29 ng/ml. Median PSA in the second and third cohorts were 27.3 and 4.3 ng/ml. Between post-AA and AA failure cohorts, 149 proteins were differentially expressed. Between early and late AA failure 98 proteins were differentially expressed; 47 proteins were common in both comparisons. ELISA assays verified expression levels of 2/47 proteins in the first cohort; zinc alpha-2 macroglobulin (ZAG), and Neuropilin-2 (NPL2). Median change in ZAG decreased by 2073.5 ng/ml (post versus pre-AA) while median change in NPL2 levels increased by 2.9 ng/ml. After a median follow-up of 43 months from the post-AA time-point, 4/15 first cohort subjects had failed AA. The RR of AA failure for ZAG levels below the median change was 3.8 (95% CI: 0.4-37) and 3.0 (95% CI: 0.3-29) for NPL2.


CONCLUSIONS
A global proteomic analysis identified ZAG and NPL2 as candidate serum predictive markers of AA response which needs further validation.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Manish Kohli"", ids = ""144503041""); list(name = ""Ann L.

7f534ede339cc8209ef63c52c52d63fed418ddee,A Derivation of the Optimal Answer-Copying Index and Some Applications,"Multiple choice exams are frequently used as an efficient and objective instrument to evaluate knowledge. Nevertheless, they are more vulnerable to answer-copying than tests based on open questions. Several statistical tests (known as indices) have been proposed to detect cheating but to the best of our knowledge they all lack a mathematical support that guarantees optimality in any sense. This work aims at filling this void by deriving the uniform most powerful (UMP) test assuming the response distribution is known. In practice we must estimate a behavioral model that yields a response distribution for each question. We calculate the empirical type-I and type-II error rates for several indices, that assume different behavioral models, using simulations based on real data from twelve nation wide multiple choice exams taken by 5th and 9th graders in Colombia. We find that the index with the highest power among those studied, subject to the restriction of preserving the type-I error, is the one that uses a nominal response model for item answering, conditions on the answers of the individual suspected of being the source of copy and calculates critical values via a normal approximation. This index was first studied by Wollack (1997) and later by W. Van der Linden and Sotaridona (2006) and is superior to the indices studied and developed by Wesolowsky (2000) and Frary, Tideman, and Watts (1977). Furthermore, we compare the performance of the indices on examination rooms with different levels of proctoring and find that increasing the level of proctoring can reduce copying by as much as 50% and that simple strategies such as having different students answer different portions of the test at different times canal so reduce cheating by over 50%. Finally, a Bonferroni type false discovery rate procedure is used to detect massive cheating. The application is straightforward and we believe it could be use to make entire examination rooms retake an exam under stricter surveillance conditions.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mauricio Romero"", ids = ""144426712""); list(name = ""Alvaro Riascos"", ids = ""144233488""); list(name = ""Diego Vinicio Jara"", ids = ""31885978"")",,903dcb441e8cc61049eafbf41c600a4c0ce8fe58; 632fce1abdb083046ca60c2efdb4f7e1d1e1062e; 62c519b7d36f5c43c8694388147bb5f52261f8fa; a05f5a5c9fe1d8a44f5960571cc6f4fbb75d0d36; e414407043e61dece2cb86fc121b2a3b533aecb6; be4ee1b2da6d1b766cc506b2a4735e4941ac3802; 01532d700028ada84d5355e4a844f49c58909c47; 22dec9c40bd12a5adde04cb6f25a27827af7d6c5; 311443369d29742a60f03d68d3ad5709da6e282a; ddf297fa86afb21bffbda0b92f2eade99410bfa9; c6af18581550e648741d79ba04c51057c5308ce2,,,

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for local structure learning of CGs. It works by first learning adjacent nodes of each variable for skeleton identification and then orienting the edges of the complexes of the graph. To control the false discovery rate (FDR) of edges when learning a CG, FDR controlling procedure is embedded in the algorithm. Algorithms for skeleton identification and complexes recovery are presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm with the FDR controlling procedure can control the false discovery rate of the skeleton of the recovered graph under a user-specified level, and the proposed algorithm is also a viable alternative to learn the structure of chain graphs.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jingyun Wang"", ids = ""48093375""); list(name = ""Sanyang Liu"", ids = ""50151911""); list(name = ""Mingmin Zhu"", ids = ""1748097"")",,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 36a4a044a840f379d284bb76559e6b16697002f7; a78e71f0e7499c35620b2333337c3c3d015e910f; 00e3019b1fa51dc703366ced95ba3f6c593bcd43; 51aea7701d094b786e65f04b7a64128cdc5ed829; e340328c335394c731094f7a7e8cf4dc9261111a; 648fe212c634d191061f89320a4b25902d80aef7; d531432ecff9f964340731d345f51e69fe9f9a93; e3b9ffde49c9b4a57b09a651187a2e194cb35693; 1ce601d89963eb411ee893585eef29729725d27c; 16b289b6b954c1440b090be3bbe41b6ab75ad1a3; 25ce08c531612da47bae00a22a8ec010349439a4; 0a332757b8a52c0aea548c1f9fde106d397e5334; 4a64af6bfb81ff1d856080138c7daee28382f7c1; 46f29e5dafdadbd5dba0136c1c00ffd88a222c24; 75d01d7479c4ef575381014559aaa4b4338f8a1c; 2f04b508b86725c4196d06a19bc2af2111466f51; 082f19517c2039668715b04f7619d7e4b95f3e0c; 62d195997e5840ddad1540b8fbbd7d505adca8f8; c3783bb7c6d3f978f91cd8a2b061c8704afd9c20; 17f9d38161e287976cbad02c0de390d50c5811fb; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 9ad3340b0fb0f714ee8f63ef7992680fee604a26; 9f31ad523e8c0e5327d10d462772b4f710a40843; 05d290a46dfbf09a027e664ccf1531056f6af891; f548bc6fc594e17e2b9b936f0c9daf24fa92af83; 382ebe081150c112969559f078f31beedb59e25d; d1eb6b71e290669f1dd1610dbad2d710bebe957b,Artificial Intelligence Review,52,293-321
87829eec780bdcab4f5f10d1d84c1feaf97aecfb,"Identification of Genetic Loci Jointly Influencing Schizophrenia Risk and the Cognitive Traits of Verbal-Numerical Reasoning, Reaction Time, and General Cognitive Function","Importance Schizophrenia is associated with widespread cognitive impairments. Although cognitive deficits are one of the factors most strongly associated with functional outcome in schizophrenia, current treatment strategies largely fail to ameliorate these impairments. To develop more efficient treatment strategies in patients with schizophrenia, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of these cognitive deficits is needed. Accumulating evidence indicates that genetic risk of schizophrenia may contribute to cognitive dysfunction. Objective To identify genomic regions jointly influencing schizophrenia and the cognitive domains of reaction time and verbal-numerical reasoning, as well as general cognitive function, a phenotype that captures the shared variation in performance across cognitive domains. Design, Setting, and Participants Combining data from genome-wide association studies from multiple phenotypes using conditional false discovery rate analysis provides increased power to discover genetic variants and could elucidate shared molecular genetic mechanisms. Data from the following genome-wide association studies, published from July 24, 2014, to January 17, 2017, were combined: schizophrenia in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰79 757 [cases, 34 486; controls, 45 271]); verbal-numerical reasoning (nâ€‰=â€‰36 035) and reaction time (nâ€‰=â€‰111 483) in the UK Biobank cohort; and general cognitive function in CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) (nâ€‰=â€‰53 949) and COGENT (Cognitive Genomics Consortium) (nâ€‰=â€‰27 888). Main Outcomes and Measures Genetic loci identified by conditional false discovery rate analysis. Brain messenger RNA expression and brain expression quantitative trait locus functionality were determined. Results Among the participants in the genome-wide association studies, 21 loci jointly influencing schizophrenia and cognitive traits were identified: 2 loci shared between schizophrenia and verbal-numerical reasoning, 6 loci shared between schizophrenia and reaction time, and 14 loci shared between schizophrenia and general cognitive function. One locus was shared between schizophrenia and 2 cognitive traits and represented the strongest shared signal detected (nearest gene TCF20; chromosome 22q13.2), and was shared between schizophrenia (z score, 5.01; Pâ€‰=â€‰5.53â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7), general cognitive function (z score, â€“4.43; Pâ€‰=â€‰9.42â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6), and verbal-numerical reasoning (z score, â€“5.43; Pâ€‰=â€‰5.64â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’8). For 18 loci, schizophrenia risk alleles were associated with poorer cognitive performance. The implicated genes are expressed in the developmental and adult human brain. Replicable expression quantitative trait locus functionality was identified for 4 loci in the adult human brain. Conclusions and Relevance The discovered loci improve the understanding of the common genetic basis underlying schizophrenia and cognitive function, suggesting novel molecular genetic mechanisms.",2017,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Olav B.

8bb9d4d31019ded447159f571ae4d9bc684534fb,Evaluation and optimisation of indel detection workflows for ion torrent sequencing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes,"BackgroundThe Ion Torrent PGM is a popular benchtop sequencer that shows promise in replacing conventional Sanger sequencing as the gold standard for mutation detection. Despite the PGMâ€™s reported high accuracy in calling single nucleotide variations, it tends to generate many false positive calls in detecting insertions and deletions (indels), which may hinder its utility for clinical genetic testing.ResultsRecently, the proprietary analytical workflow for the Ion Torrent sequencer, Torrent Suite (TS), underwent a series of upgrades. We evaluated three major upgrades of TS by calling indels in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Our analysis revealed that false negative indels could be generated by TS under both default calling parameters and parameters adjusted for maximum sensitivity. However, indel calling with the same data using the open source variant callers, GATK and SAMtools showed that false negatives could be minimised with the use of appropriate bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, we identified two variant calling measures, Quality-by-Depth (QD) and VARiation of the Width of gaps and inserts (VARW), which substantially reduced false positive indels, including non-homopolymer associated errors without compromising sensitivity. In our best case scenario that involved the TMAP aligner and SAMtools, we achieved 100% sensitivity, 99.99% specificity and 29% False Discovery Rate (FDR) in indel calling from all 23 samples, which is a good performance for mutation screening using PGM.ConclusionsNew versions of TS, BWA and GATK have shown improvements in indel calling sensitivity and specificity over their older counterpart. However, the variant caller of TS exhibits a lower sensitivity than GATK and SAMtools. Our findings demonstrate that although indel calling from PGM sequences may appear to be noisy at first glance, proper computational indel calling analysis is able to maximize both the sensitivity and specificity at the single base level, paving the way for the usage of this technology for future clinical genetic testing.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhen Xuan Yeo"", ids = ""1714092""); list(name = ""Joshua C.

8352013bb4e7195dcf8b1e134fbaab47d545871b,Normalization and statistical analysis of quantitative proteomics data generated by metabolic labeling.,"Comparative proteomics is a powerful analytical method for learning about the responses of biological systems to changes in growth parameters. To make confident inferences about biological responses, proteomics approaches must incorporate appropriate statistical measures of quantitative data. In the present work we applied microarray-based normalization and statistical analysis (significance testing) methods to analyze quantitative proteomics data generated from the metabolic labeling of a marine bacterium (Sphingopyxis alaskensis). Quantitative data were generated for 1,172 proteins, representing 1,736 high confidence protein identifications (54% genome coverage). To test approaches for normalization, cells were grown at a single temperature, metabolically labeled with (14)N or (15)N, and combined in different ratios to give an artificially skewed data set. Inspection of ratio versus average (MA) plots determined that a fixed value median normalization was most suitable for the data. To determine an appropriate statistical method for assessing differential abundance, a -fold change approach, Student's t test, unmoderated t test, and empirical Bayes moderated t test were applied to proteomics data from cells grown at two temperatures. Inverse metabolic labeling was used with multiple technical and biological replicates, and proteomics was performed on cells that were combined based on equal optical density of cultures (providing skewed data) or on cell extracts that were combined to give equal amounts of protein (no skew). To account for arbitrarily complex experiment-specific parameters, a linear modeling approach was used to analyze the data using the limma package in R/Bioconductor. A high quality list of statistically significant differentially abundant proteins was obtained by using lowess normalization (after inspection of MA plots) and applying the empirical Bayes moderated t test. The approach also effectively controlled for the number of false discoveries and corrected for the multiple testing problem using the Storey-Tibshirani false discovery rate (Storey, J. D., and Tibshirani, R. (2003) Statistical significance for genomewide studies. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 9440-9445).

Dental caries is a common, chronic, and complex disease leading to a decrease in quality of life worldwide. In this study, we applied the approaches of gene set enrichment analysis to a major dental caries GWAS dataset, which consists of 537 cases and 605 controls. Using four complementary gene set analysis methods, we analyzed 1331 Gene Ontology (GO) terms collected from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Setting false discovery rate (FDR) threshold as 0.05, we identified 13 significantly associated GO terms. Additionally, 17 terms were further included as marginally associated because they were top ranked by each method, although their FDR is higher than 0.05. In total, we identified 30 promising GO terms, including 'Sphingoid metabolic process,' 'Ubiquitin protein ligase activity,' 'Regulation of cytokine secretion,' and 'Ceramide metabolic process.' These GO terms encompass broad functions that potentially interact and contribute to the oral immune response related to caries development, which have not been reported in the standard single marker based analysis. Collectively, our gene set enrichment analysis provided complementary insights into the molecular mechanisms and polygenic interactions in dental caries, revealing promising association signals that could not be detected through single marker analysis of GWAS data.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Quan Wang"", ids = ""47598827""); list(name = ""Peilin Jia"", ids = ""144723738""); list(name = ""Karen T.

9437b89119f65c18be9e10a1aa3286d40b1c332e,Interrogation of transcriptomic changes associated with drug-induced hepatic sinusoidal dilatation in colorectal cancer,"Drug-related sinusoidal dilatation (SD) is a common form of hepatotoxicity associated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy used prior to resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Recently, hepatic SD has also been associated with anti-delta like 4 (DLL4) cancer therapies targeting the NOTCH pathway. To investigate the hypothesis that NOTCH signaling plays an important role in drug-induced SD, gene expression changes were examined in livers from anti-DLL4 and oxaliplatin-induced SD in non-human primate (NHP) and patients, respectively. Putative mechanistic biomarkers of bevacizumab (bev)-mediated protection against oxaliplatin-induced SD were also investigated. RNA was extracted from whole liver sections or centrilobular regions by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) obtained from NHP administered anti-DLL4 fragment antigen-binding (F(ab')2 or patients with CRLM receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bev. mRNA expression was quantified using high-throughput real-time quantitative PCR. Significance analysis was used to identify genes with differential expression patterns (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Eleven (CCL2, CCND1, EFNB2, ERG, ICAM1, IL16, LFNG, NOTCH1, NOTCH4, PRDX1, and TGFB1) and six (CDH5, EFNB2, HES1, IL16, MIK67, HES1 and VWF) candidate genes were differentially expressed in the liver of anti-DLL4- and oxaliplatin-induced SD, respectively. Addition of bev to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy resulted in differential changes in hepatic CDH5, HEY1, IL16, JAG1, MMP9, NOTCH4 and TIMP1 expression. This work implicates NOTCH and IL16 pathways in the pathogenesis of drug-induced SD and further explains the hepato-protective effect of bev in oxaliplatin-induced SD observed in CRLM patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Monika A Jarzabek"", ids = ""40252279""); list(name = ""William R Proctor"", ids = ""46555427""); list(name = ""Jennifer Vogt"", ids = ""10029966""); list(name = ""Rupal Desai"", ids = ""5854614""); list(name = ""Patrick Dicker"", ids = ""4504432""); list(name = ""Gary Cain"", ids = ""118868524""); list(name = ""Rajiv Raja"", ids = ""47123319""); list(name = ""Jens Brodbeck"", ids = ""4011779""); list(name = ""Dale R.

86cc659d2c60cc93968c9fcb9fc71c0243223c13,A genome wide association study identifies new genes potentially associated with eyelid sagging.,"Sagging eyelid is considered as an outward of skin ageing and may cause medical issues. However, little is known about the factors involved in sagging eyelid. The study, which aims at determining genetic risk factors for eyelid sagging, was conducted in a cohort of 502 unrelated Caucasian women living in the Paris region. All included participants were aged between 44 and 70Â years old (mean age, 57.6Â years old). The severity of sagging eyelid was graded in 6 categories by a dermatologist using standardized photographs of the face. A genome wide association study adjusted on potential risk factors (including age and smoking habits) was conducted to identify genetic associations. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in total linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 10, rs16927253 (PÂ =Â 7.07Â Ã—Â 10-10 ) and rs4746957 (PÂ =Â 1.06Â Ã—Â 10-8 ), were significantly associated with eyelid sagging severity. The rs16927253-T and rs4746957-A alleles showed a dominant protective effect towards eyelid sagging. These polymorphisms are located in intronic parts of the H2AFY2 gene which encodes a member of the H2A histone family and very close to the AIFM2 gene that induces apoptosis. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms with a false discovery rate below 0.25 were located nearby the type XIII collagen COL13A1 gene on chromosome 10 and in the ADAMTS18 gene on chromosome 16. Several relevant genes were identified by the genome wide association study for their potential role in the sagging eyelid severity.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vincent Laville"", ids = ""3433597""); list(name = ""Sigrid Le Clerc"", ids = ""6138768""); list(name = ""Khaled Ezzedine"", ids = ""4914827""); list(name = ""Randa Jdid"", ids = ""6259035""); list(name = ""Lieng Taing"", ids = ""2410978""); list(name = ""Toufik Labib"", ids = ""15270238""); list(name = ""CÃ©dric Coulonges"", ids = ""2930167""); list(name = ""Damien Ulveling"", ids = ""6885191""); list(name = ""Pilar Galan"", ids = ""145727825""); list(name = ""Christiane Guinot"", ids = ""49765139""); list(name = ""LÃ©opold K Fezeu"", ids = ""51888870""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©rique Morizot"", ids = ""4009503""); list(name = ""Julie Latreille"", ids = ""46362593""); list(name = ""Denis Malvy"", ids = ""2652314""); list(name = ""Erwin Tschachler"", ids = ""4642352""); list(name = ""Jean-FranÃ§ois Zagury"", ids = ""2640857"")",,,Experimental dermatology,,
a058e3c1c4dea013976568a062659ddae6f25ba1,Genetic polymorphisms of peptidase inhibitor 3 (elafin) are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"Peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3, elafin) is a protease inhibitor produced locally in the lung, where it plays a central role in controlling excessive activity of neutrophil elastase. Our previous study revealed that PI3 gene expression is down-regulated during the acute stage of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether genetic variants in PI3 gene are associated with ARDS development. Based on resequencing data from 29 unrelated white subjects, three tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms were selected and genotyped in a prospective cohort consisting of 449 white patients with ARDS (cases) and 1,031 critically ill patients (at-risk control subjects). We found that the variant allele of rs2664581 (T34P) was significantly associated with increased ARDS risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.67; P = 0.006; false discovery rate adjusted P = 0.018). Moreover, this association was stronger among subjects with extrapulmonary injury. The common haplotype Hap2 (TTC), containing the variant allele of rs2664581, was also identified as a risk haplotype for ARDS (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64; P = 0.015). Furthermore, the rs2664581 polymorphism was associated with circulating PI3 levels in multivariate analyses. Patients with ARDS homozygous for the wild-type A allele of rs2664581 showed significant lower PI3 plasma level (P = 0.019) at ARDS onset as compared with those homozygous or heterozygous for the variant C allele.

Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe chronic hepatic parasitic disease currently emerging in central and eastern Europe. Untreated AE presents a high mortality (>90%) due to a severe hepatic destruction as a result of parasitic metacestode proliferation which behaves like a malignant tumor. Despite this severe course and outcome of disease, the genetic program that regulates the host response leading to organ damage as a consequence of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis is largely unknown.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We used a mouse model of AE to assess gene expression profiles in the liver after establishment of a chronic disease status as a result of a primary peroral infection with eggs of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Among 38 genes differentially regulated (false discovery rate adjusted p</=0.05), 35 genes were assigned to the functional gene ontology group <immune response>, while 3 associated with the functional group <intermediary metabolism>. Upregulated genes associated with <immune response> could be clustered into functional subgroups including <macrophages>, <APCs>, <lymphocytes, chemokines and regulation>, <B-cells> and <eosinophils>. Two downregulated genes related to <lymphocytes, chemokines and regulation> and <intermediary metabolism>, respectively. The <immune response> genes either associated with an <immunosupression> or an <immunostimulation> pathway. From the overexpressed genes, 18 genes were subsequently processed with a Custom Array microfluidic card system in order to assess respective expression status at the mRNA level relative to 5 reference genes (Gapdh, Est1, Rlp3, Mdh-1, Rpl37) selected upon a constitutive and stable expression level. The results generated by the two independent tools used for the assessment of gene expression, i.e., microarray and microfluidic card system, exhibited a high level of congruency (Spearman correlation rho = 0.81, p = 7.87e-5) and thus validated the applied methods.

10cd7a942cd8746ca935ab93ae6b0b6db14857cf,Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal,"Summary form only given. Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal can involve a large number of hypotheses. For instance, two satellite images of the same scene, taken before and after an event, could be used to test a hypothesis that the event has no environmental impact. This is equivalent to testing that the mean difference of ""after-before"" is zero at each of the (typically thousands of) pixels that make up the scene. In such a situation, conventional testing procedures that control the overall Type I error deteriorate as the number of hypotheses increase. Powerful testing procedures are needed for this problem of testing for the presence of a spatial signal. In this talk, we propose a procedure called enhanced FDR (EFDR), which is based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and a concept known as generalized degrees of freedom (GDF). EFDR differs from the standard FDR procedure through its reducing of the number of hypotheses tested. This is done in two ways: first, the model is represented more parsimoniously in the wavelet domain, and second, an optimal selection of hypotheses is made using a criterion based on generalized degrees of freedom. Not only does the EFDR procedure tell us whether a spatial signal is present or not, it has an added bonus that, if a signal is deemed present, it can indicate its location and magnitude. The EFDR procedure is applied to an air-temperature data set generated from the climate system model (CSM) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and to brain-imaging data from fMRI experiments.",2003,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Noel A Cressie"", ids = ""48393332"")",,,,97,1122-1140
0eb114330ea0b9f4eabde59b5f2d99320ccaf97a,Gene networks associated with conditional fear in mice identified using a systems genetics approach,"BackgroundOur understanding of the genetic basis of learning and memory remains shrouded in mystery. To explore the genetic networks governing the biology of conditional fear, we used a systems genetics approach to analyze a hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) with high mapping resolution.ResultsA total of 27 behavioral quantitative trait loci were mapped with a false discovery rate of 5%. By integrating fear phenotypes, transcript profiling data from hippocampus and striatum and also genotype information, two gene co-expression networks correlated with context-dependent immobility were identified. We prioritized the key markers and genes in these pathways using intramodular connectivity measures and structural equation modeling. Highly connected genes in the context fear modules included Psmd6, Ube2a and Usp33, suggesting an important role for ubiquitination in learning and memory. In addition, we surveyed the architecture of brain transcript regulation and demonstrated preservation of gene co-expression modules in hippocampus and striatum, while also highlighting important differences. Rps15a, Kif3a, Stard7, 6330503K22RIK, and Plvap were among the individual genes whose transcript abundance were strongly associated with fear phenotypes.ConclusionApplication of our multi-faceted mapping strategy permits an increasingly detailed characterization of the genetic networks underlying behavior.",2010,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Christopher C.

0694b966a35030134429164385e28f372e238164,Genomeâ€wide profiling of mRNA and lncRNA expression in dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever,"Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are recurrent diseases that are widespread in the tropics. Here, we identified candidate genes associated with these diseases by performing integrated analyses of DF (GSE51808) and DHF (GSE18090) microarray datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In all, we identified 7635 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DF and 8147 DEGs in DHF as compared to healthy controls (PÂ <Â 0.05). In addition, we discovered 215 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) in DF and 225 DElncRNAs in DHF. There were 1256 common DEGs and eight common DElncRNAs in DHF vs DF, DHF vs normal control, and DF vs normal control groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that signal transduction (false discovery rateÂ =Â 8.33E-10), 'toxoplasmosis', and 'protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum' were significantly enriched pathways for common DEGs. We conclude that the MAGED1,STAT1, and IL12A genes may play crucial roles in DF and DHF, and suggest that our findings may facilitate the identification of biomarkers and the development of new drug design strategies for DF and DHF treatment.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaoâ\200\220Lan Zhong"", ids = ""82849370""); list(name = ""Xiaoâ\200\220Ming Liao"", ids = ""82210780""); list(name = ""Fei Shen"", ids = ""46755881""); list(name = ""Haijian Yu"", ids = ""82179464""); list(name = ""Wensheng Yan"", ids = ""82622722""); list(name = ""Yunfang Zhang"", ids = ""82946065""); list(name = ""Jiaâ\200\220Jun Ye"", ids = ""81953860""); list(name = ""Zhiping Lv"", ids = ""83087120"")",,21609b71b928d73a83e885f81cc1ca97c9fe5b29; 891e294f4e60ad57231fff232ba0eab96a774460; e32ac2e20237a8a09d4a9edd9969eb56b8d89c44; 6c79d711f169ba844955120e811583257d64ef08; e5e97d62be7d5b7f44b11a63cbd373060c885cfa; 19f95967a2c16f648532a9d208bfd55ab879a712; f561990486bfcf8ba6627bf2a198487474944111; 5dd3fd6876e4db3a011e529082962addf85d10ea; 4dbf2183d831da8a59885702744a649b1f6f11d3; 38fabef31e7ea7d2b24423cb234ea1c4a7646bbc; 66e8487e60b169cd5b86c436fde2ea28fe3eaaf9; cb5ebd22fe188fd7b156bded7b17d8a4520455d7; abb1f8ad2ba6fc7d1b562f90dd9e8f4f79360d78; b18dd0bd3215e821d7367c3915358877554eda45; f3d03ba23aee79e247f5756faf04af34d99fb072; c8ffbc86afcc7756515ea71c3c336eea83e36f36; b46b94d31e6ffc3fe046253f55c17420b3c0781d; a13d3955ff21ff6f213040059648e56ea79230c3; 657c1aef5783c625b04f6bd5eae8974b39721554; dc5cb71d694574447f4ba8460078083231d4ecaa; 99221aa1c0dae8187627fc6e00201529b5d19b03; ba64733812da1faac18e1d8885892514be2d967c; f523c27db58d338753be203b3c613ff0a90315a1; 8af1315d7a47a93e0e808e0d04670797e0c7be85; 0c6a4939833865de4315155ad3ab440c8b675328; 3a610f843a7a97421013297d91eef1779030858c; 00383d48bd1d2801a633a4967ebd5ee180b0d1f6,FEBS Open Bio,9,468 - 477
6515e1c42fd9cdbf83ad7d91bf1ee7c8e98e551b,The problem with peptide presumption and the downfall of target-decoy false discovery rates.,"In proteomics, peptide-tandem mass spectrum match scores and target-decoy database derived false discovery rates (FDR) are confidence indicators describing the quality of individual and sets of tandem mass spectrum matches. A user can impose a standard by prescribing a limit to these values, equivalent to drawing a line that separates better from poorer quality matches. As a result of setting narrower parent ion mass tolerances to reflect the better resolution of modern mass spectrometers, target-decoy derived FDRs can diminish. FDRs lowered this way consequently drive down the lower-limit for peptide-spectrum match score acceptance. Hence, data quality confidence appears to improve even while fragmentation evidence for some spectra remains weak. One negative outcome can be the presumed identification of peptides that do not exist. The options researchers have to improve proteomics data confidence are not panaceas, and there may be no satisfying solution as long as peptides are identified from a circumscribed list of proteins scientists wish to find.",2012,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bret Cooper"", ids = ""36777276"")",bdf941b1af86214a11872936138db1a4a9b65893; cf24c819d5bb518bdce05aca32a2d42aa2cc99b7; 6be22dab1cedf4e9d421ce6371ede3af69e0d87b; 338acd3690bf35f3f4948ad2e550a694c1a29808; 7d4ae1018da56138a3022880748de30103232254,,Analytical chemistry,84 22,"

Within the work, we propose a computational method for answering such questions as deciding optimal argument pairs (peak number, p-value threshold, selected bin size and false discovery rate) from estrogen receptor Î± ChIP-seq data, and detecting corresponding transcription factor binding sites. We employ a signal processing-based approach to extract inherent genomic features from the identified transcription factor binding sites, which illuminates novel evidence for further analysis and experimental validation. Thus eventually we attempt to exploit the potentiality of ChIP-seq for deep comprehension of inherent biological meanings from the high-throughput genomic sequences.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Binhua Tang"", ids = ""39693992""); list(name = ""Yufan Zhou"", ids = ""143813965""); list(name = ""Victor X.

34860ccfae1329f5d4ac9630d4bed0f3e444d063,Optimization of an RNA-Seq Differential Gene Expression Analysis Depending on Biological Replicate Number and Library Size,"RNA-Seq is a widely used technology that allows an efficient genome-wide quantification of gene expressions for, for example, differential expression (DE) analysis. After a brief review of the main issues, methods and tools related to the DE analysis of RNA-Seq data, this article focuses on the impact of both the replicate number and library size in such analyses. While the main drawback of previous relevant studies is the lack of generality, we conducted both an analysis of a two-condition experiment (with eight biological replicates per condition) to compare the results with previous benchmark studies, and a meta-analysis of 17 experiments with up to 18 biological conditions, eight biological replicates and 100 million (M) reads per sample. As a global trend, we concluded that the replicate number has a larger impact than the library size on the power of the DE analysis, except for low-expressed genes, for which both parameters seem to have the same impact. Our study also provides new insights for practitioners aiming to enhance their experimental designs. For instance, by analyzing both the sensitivity and specificity of the DE analysis, we showed that the optimal threshold to control the false discovery rate (FDR) is approximately 2-r, where r is the replicate number. Furthermore, we showed that the false positive rate (FPR) is rather well controlled by all three studied R packages: DESeq, DESeq2, and edgeR. We also analyzed the impact of both the replicate number and library size on gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Interestingly, we concluded that increases in the replicate number and library size tend to enhance the sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the GO analysis. Finally, we recommend to RNA-Seq practitioners the production of a pilot data set to strictly analyze the power of their experimental design, or the use of a public data set, which should be similar to the data set they will obtain. For individuals working on tomato research, on the basis of the meta-analysis, we recommend at least four biological replicates per condition and 20 M reads per sample to be almost sure of obtaining about 1000 DE genes if they exist.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sophie Lamarre"", ids = ""5011006""); list(name = ""Pierre Frasse"", ids = ""6800674""); list(name = ""Mohamed Zouine"", ids = ""4471678""); list(name = ""Delphine Labourdette"", ids = ""4724103""); list(name = ""Elise Sainderichin"", ids = ""1405038282""); list(name = ""Guojian Hu"", ids = ""6850846""); list(name = ""VÃ©ronique Le Berre-Anton"", ids = ""1404851453""); list(name = ""Mondher Bouzayen"", ids = ""6297783""); list(name = ""Elie Maza"", ids = ""2415193"")",582510d05b4d9a1303c840ae9d7de59996821ba2; 7731e4248c18bf77c17ca8e3d9da47858fc46cab; d991a865f00a1357f1a487001c1431d7a49bc33c; 3649e8b39149d2c8233ee7c2451ba814db2606f7; 789f981c3a3595df61395fc947b3f8030b07caeb; 3109393967ed9e1b3c5a2e994728d0465ef07995; b68e89093e20b4f845e94cd2e291603d49111e9c; 562c3b15b5388465229be2ad315ba0b7bc428143; 34c22b703326f22b78f3dcf08f0f2a020c9ec06c; 9a3779d24104a517ac008e2c3e610944693f2f65,b5860253e015c27e8b125cf9b7ba2cb543dc36ed; de377f87f114812ea9fbfa9b1c5e790506f3f08f; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; a834b996c8ba92ea55c6dd7f4a710de6d4b4dc7c; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; 1f82af4d7f5e41a6313a6851ca748145798e3b61; b180c50ee294d2148e187148c472141d53fbd947; 0141c5e6f271f98722904c30d3ae9fd348bd7204; ceaf89d5cd2391e13ebc5e3f1e26002f77465b3d; c6fbd16f76ec95a0cc24a0d7e1d2b2ab3d0a1cb6; f9a710c3a5c31c70d4704c2df83f5912f6de91b3; d7a2290afec8cbf68946c66a511d0823a5eb1253; e4a5829b5e65a94335b2d2d2c0d69fbaed55a3b5; 385d419737ab1fee9271c74eaa32460d3c4d0e52; 1539020b8e91a6c9cf3a502729c197436a272493; d16c72ba11ba9ee16bc65ae6c2917a40541b36d0; f0a1a656ed2e24085c1fd54b7f669aaabf765145; b695cb5a9718ca530aba8b2a2174657d4996d4e8; 4dd5845aca177809f48a36ab562823d54416dee3; a40d64fd8569d17fd227d2748e96613910833109; 62f8a69c7e3809949dd023852e0e0a54c49eaf74; 6e0b7fc2399cd790a8c057047bbff1cbc7d84c15; aecde337ef45dd84cde322505e4db5585a32e808; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 5242bd2662111dfb50c6c587870ed1006698b32e; 66d80625401d3fa1e366edcc057191aa7ef741a5; 2664d79ed1bf6a51975e6ba04a7f32ada256fb2f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e2684ce42b1be65ca6158b0da8c5561dc6d44dc8; 2d222691c3da3590775f45bd353af81609918474; 667f54da16b65cffa1372c320a8c9fec65b828be; ba87e09099e73070efc5f8b93572153b32bd2e82; 623811c52a3f09aeb03e56d4cafe32d6bec20ba5; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; cb3e1e08a1c2c8a83f456ccbbbf28b81dc77141d; 701cae7fb41417989c384bcd8268a620c4669ca4; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; 17868f976dd014be13acaf1ceff94c802abf14a0; 58f7fd8492572f21582a1d21aebeb113d07a4f8d; bcf2cf850c73f98bfc918f6bfb45b1c9b9681018; 5e7f43b528a0bf49475eb3133f335a57e2fc206e; 9e9e00ef44ec9f5f4136be8969162c774485a131; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; c1ea7e8c8542a305c2f1c771e0320bb9b578eeb4; d3b35ec87e07ae576d5a45465b89518f927703ff; 0e4ef9fe745155f4711d453fbb1e84a88d1042bf; b80dac9bfc1c2de944535c6cac7f14638bcf0ce9; 0cd2b1545f69841d61d0f598db3e311b0546562b; 70ebcc398484e6f9d7686039b40086eb19f29467; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; 37cae00437f3d00a8aff2417fe6354137fc04999; 8f02666e3e74721cbcffe09ec99ba71ce2bb63b7; 7a0842dd9253d8845460c1309d5c64d49a3f9c1d; e3676dbc5742777a72afe322d3a12cd88678c7b9; 2cd8dc8fe9e89af280eef7e5b00cecd73e564da9; fc0a88d2f6d89787759af6f8ee808b98f3fabfd0; 55507aba54a92b31a200e8112f088f5c356ed7bc; 7e52445a90795a25117cf5be9955ab6a88ed05d6; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 36e00caa724a4f8865b6f675fa27f7297e51ba41; 2ad0f570dee80d85169c40195db766f3e22f74e7; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 394c9593f7312d6bd621a1daa3fa374878f39c70,Frontiers in Plant Science,9,
bd075e82c4f3e24504f847f5b0ba3b88d3e724d3,Human Plasma Metabolomics in Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Meta-Analysis of Two Cohorts,"The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, remains only partially understood. This has led to the current lack of accessible and reliable biofluid biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, and absence of treatments for dry AMD. This study aimed to assess the plasma metabolomic profiles of AMD and its severity stages with the ultimate goal of contributing to addressing these needs. We recruited two cohorts: Boston, United States (n = 196) and Coimbra, Portugal (n = 295). Fasting blood samples were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. For each cohort, we compared plasma metabolites of AMD patients versus controls (logistic regression), and across disease stages (permutation-based cumulative logistic regression considering both eyes). Meta-analyses were then used to combine results from the two cohorts. Our results revealed that 28 metabolites differed significantly between AMD patients versus controls (false discovery rate (FDR) q-value: 4.1 Ã— 10-2-1.8 Ã— 10-5), and 67 across disease stages (FDR q-value: 4.5 Ã— 10-2-1.7 Ã— 10-4). Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of glycerophospholipid, purine, taurine and hypotaurine, and nitrogen metabolism (p-value â‰¤ 0.04). In conclusion, our findings support that AMD patients present distinct plasma metabolomic profiles, which vary with disease severity. This work contributes to the understanding of AMD pathophysiology, and can be the basis of future biomarkers and precision medicine for this blinding condition.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""InÃªs LaÃ­ns"", ids = ""9670389""); list(name = ""Wonil Chung"", ids = ""8088979""); list(name = ""Rachel S Kelly"", ids = ""145262626""); list(name = ""J M Gil"", ids = ""39193576""); list(name = ""Marco Marques"", ids = ""143981348""); list(name = ""PatrÃ­cia Barreto"", ids = ""49393890""); list(name = ""J.

6de445ff977e0caa8ca2cbc7da693646047d255d,Proteomic and bioinformatic analysis of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla: the basis for plant parasitism.,"On the basis of the complete genome sequence of the root-knot nematode Melodogyne hapla, we have deduced and annotated the entire proteome of this plant-parasite to create a database of 14,420 proteins. We have made this database, termed HapPep3, available from the Superfamily repository of model organism proteomes (http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY). To experimentally confirm the HapPep3 assignments using proteomics, we applied a data-independent LC/MS(E) analysis to M. hapla protein extracts fractionated by SDS-PAGE. A total of 516 nonredundant proteins were identified with an average of 9 unique peptides detected per protein. Some proteins, including examples with complex gene organization, were defined by more than 20 unique peptide matches, thus, providing experimental confirmation of computational predictions of intron/exon structures. On the basis of comparisons of the broad physicochemical properties of the experimental and computational proteomes, we conclude that the identified proteins reflect a true and unbiased sampling of HapPep3. Conversely, HapPep3 appears to broadly cover the protein space able to be experimentally sampled. To estimate the false discovery rate, we queried human, plant, and bacterial databases for matches to the LC/MS(E)-derived peptides, revealing fewer than 1% of matches, most of which were to highly conserved proteins. To provide a functional comparison of the acquired and deduced proteomes, each was subjected to higher order annotation, including comparisons of Gene Ontology, protein domains, signaling, and localization predictions, further indicating concordance, although those proteins that did deviate seem to be highly significant. Approximately 20% of the experimentally sampled proteome was predicted to be secreted, and thus potentially play a role at the host-parasite interface. We examined reference pathways to determine the extent of proteome similarity of M. hapla to that of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, revealing significant similarities and differences. Collectively, the analyzed protein set provides an initial foundation to experimentally dissect the basis of plant parasitism by M. hapla.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Flaubert Mbeunkui"", ids = ""5033703""); list(name = ""Elizabeth H.

Here, in sub-samples of these Finnish families, we utilize gene expression levels and psychoactive medication use, in order to translate the role of the DISC1 network into biological consequences and potential treatment implications. Genome wide gene expression levels were determined using the Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip, in 63 individuals from 18 families, whilst prescription medication information has been collected over a ten year period for all 931 affected individuals. Analysis of the gene expression data, demonstrated that the NDE1 SNP rs2242549 was associated, at the false discovery rate p-value threshold of 0.05, with changes in a large number of probes (n = 1,363). Notably, a significant number of the genes altered (268 out of 1,250) are also predicted to be targets of microRNA 484, which is located on a 5â€™ non-coding exon of NDE1. Variants within the NDE1 locus also displayed significant association to early cessation of psychoactive medications, specifically a genotype by gender interaction significantly associated with use of CYP2C19 metabolised medications. Furthermore, in a cell culture system, it could be demonstrated that miR-484 can affect the expression of CYP2C19. Together, these findings suggest that mutations at the NDE1 locus may alter risk to mental illness, at least in part through the functional modification of miR-484, and that such modification also alters treatment response to specific psychoactive medications, leading to the potential for the NDE1 locus to be used to assist in the targeting of treatment for psychiatric illness.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""William Hennah"", ids = ""2394078""); list(name = ""Nicholas J Bradshaw"", ids = ""2123520""); list(name = ""Maiju Pankakoski"", ids = ""6861798""); list(name = ""Alfredo Ortega-Alonso"", ids = ""1400754522""); list(name = ""Jari Haukka"", ids = ""50185895"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,27,s510-s511

The genetic basis of IBD is well founded, and susceptibility loci have been identified on several different chromosomes. We aimed to define genotype-phenotype relationships and interactions with the IBD susceptibility gene CARD15for various IBD susceptibility loci (IBD1, IBD2, IBD5, IBD6, IBD7, and chromosome 4) by characterizing previously described peak LOD score short tandem repeat (STR) markers. The study population consisted of 484 severely affected Caucasian patients with IBD, 144 healthy controls, and 348 nonaffected first-degree relatives of IBD patients. Associations were defined with the use of population- and family-based methodology. Correction for multiple testing was performed with a method based on an experimental false discovery rate. We provide novel evidence to show that IBD2 is involved in susceptibility to IC and terminal ileal CD in this population, with overrepresentation of IBD2 STR D12S83 (GenBank Z16592.1) allele 7 (g.49_60del[CA](6)) in IC (q = 0.038, P = 0.014) and underrepresentation of allele 8 (g.51_60del[CA](5)) in terminal ileal CD (q = 0.038, P = 0.016). The association of IBD2 with IC was confirmed by family-based testing. We also provide novel evidence to show that IBD5 is involved in susceptibility to IC and colonic/ileocolonic CD in this population, with overrepresentation of IBD5 STR D5S1984 (GenBank Z52623.1) allele 5 (g.183_186del[CA](2)) in both IC (q = 0.040, P = 0.005) and colonic/ileocolonic CD (q = 0.040, P = 0.004). Evidence is also given for potential interactions between CARD15and IBD2/IBD5. Other findings include an association of IBD2 with UC, and an association of IBD1 with terminal ileal and colonic/ileocolonic CD.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nigel P. S.

d4343a8efe76d17615a805e0e8a1fc0855bee7d1,Induction of dendritic cell-like phenotype in macrophages during foam cell formation.,"Foam cell formation from monocyte-derived macrophages is a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. Aspects of this process can be recapitulated in vitro by exposing M-CSF-induced or platelet factor 4 (CXCL4)-induced macrophages to oxidized (ox) or minimally modified (mm) low density lipoprotein (LDL). We measured gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes, and macrophages treated with CXCL1 (GRO-alpha) or CCL2 (MCP-1), as well as foam cells induced by native LDL, mmLDL, or oxLDL using 22 Affymetrix gene chips. Using an advanced Bayesian error-pooling approach and a heterogeneous error model with a false discovery rate <0.05, we found 5,303 of 22,215 probe sets to be significantly regulated in at least one of the conditions. Among a subset of 917 candidate genes that were preselected for their known biological functions in macrophage foam-cell differentiation, we found that 290 genes met the above statistical criteria for significant differential expression patterns. While many expected genes were found to be upregulated by LDL and oxLDL, very few were induced by mmLDL. We also found induction of unexpected genes, most strikingly MHC-II and other dendritic cell markers such as CD11c. The gene expression patterns in response to oxLDL were similar in M-CSF-induced and CXCL4-induced macrophages. Our findings suggest that LDL and oxLDL, but not mmLDL, induce a dendritic cell-like phenotype in macrophages, suggesting that these cells may be able to present antigens and support an immune response.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hyung Jun Cho"", ids = ""2388482""); list(name = ""Pavel Shashkin"", ids = ""144933778""); list(name = ""Christian A.

Candida albicans Phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-Bisphosphate (PIP2) Directs Aberrant Cytokinesis and Septation in Response to Echinocandins, Which Correlates with Fungicidal Activity and Attenuated Virulence","Background. We developed and validated a mouse model of C. albicans IAC that mimics peritonitis and abscesses (IAA) in humans, and that is amenable to temporalâ€“ spatial transcriptional profiling and virulence studies. Methods. We measured C. albicans SC5314 gene expression by RNA-Seq (RiboPure extraction; Illumina MiSeq) in triplicate during early peritonitis (within 30 minutes of infection), late peritonitis (24 hours) and IAA (48 hours). Differential expression was defined by â‰¥2-fold differences at false discovery rate â‰¤0.01. Results. â‰¥7 million C. albicans reads were detected in each experiment. 67% of C. albicans reads mapped to coding sequences, covering 93% of open reading frames. The 50 C. albicans genes most highly expressed during early peritonitis were associated with pH (including RIM101 and PHR1) and oxidative stress responses, and adhesion/ hyphal growth (e.g., ALS3, HWP1, ECM331, SAP6). The corresponding 50 C. albicans late peritonitis genes were associated with neutrophil/macrophage responses and nutrient acquisition (glyoxylate cycle, fatty acid Î²-oxidation, iron homeostasis). Responses within IAA included DNA damage and iron metabolism, reflecting stress response and nutrient/metal limitation. The top 50 core gene responses for all stages were associated with adhesion, stress response, and glucose transport. Among the most up-regulated genes in late peritonitis and IAA compared with early peritonitis were those involved antifungal drug resistance (CDR family, MDR1, FLU1, and ERG family), although mice were not exposed to antifungals. Null and reconstitution mutants for genes involved in adhesion (ALS3), copper transport (CCC2), DNA (DDI1) and cell wall damage responses (DAP1 homologs), and glycerol biosynthesis (RHR2) were attenuated for virulence in temporal-spatial fashion during peritonitis and IAA, and/or hyper-susceptible to phagocytosis and echinocandins (table). Conclusion. C. albicans relies upon diverse biologic processes to cause peritonitis and IAA. Multiple genes induced in response to stress during IAC mediate virulence, phagocyte, and echinocandin resistance. Therefore, pathogenic strategies used by C. albicans during IAC may lessen responses to echinocandin treatment, even in the absence of drug exposure or FKS mutations.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hassan Badrane"", ids = ""49522002""); list(name = ""M Hong Nguyen"", ids = ""134444024""); list(name = ""Cornelius J.

e6ee55ea4604661bf4556812cc218989afaccdeb,LSC 2012 abstract - Age-related changes in the relative expression of functional genes in mesenchymal stem cells,"Age-associated changes increased susceptibility to a variety of lung pathologies. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells or B-MSCs have emerged as a critical reparative response mechanism to lung injury. We had demonstrated an association, in animal models, between age and an increase in the susceptibility to injury and we had identified functional differences between B-MSCs from young and old mice.In the present study, we examined the consequences of aging in the gene expression.

METHODS: 3 and 24 months old B6 mice were sacrificed and B-MSC were isolated according to the expression of the surface markers. RNA was obtained after sorting and used for hybridization on Agilent gene expression microarrays. Ingenuity software was used to determine functional enrichment. For statistical analysis we applied significance analysis of microarrays. A qvalue of 5, which corresponds to a 5% false discovery rate, was used as a cutoff of statistical significance. Gene validations were performed by RT-PCR.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that aging induce a decrease in the gene expression on B-MSC. The mechanisms affected by the decrease on gene expression includecellular trafficking, cellular growth and proliferation.

CONCLUSION: Old B-MSCs have a different expression profile that exhibits a decrease in the expression of genes that control importan B-MSC functions.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Martha L.

4028dc29ef76ba391cd17b5ceb507f0569514db9,K-core decomposition of a protein domain co-occurrence network reveals lower cancer mutation rates for interior cores,"BackgroundNetwork biology currently focuses primarily on metabolic pathways, gene regulatory, and protein-protein interaction networks. While these approaches have yielded critical information, alternative methods to network analysis will offer new perspectives on biological information. A little explored area is the interactions between domains that can be captured using domain co-occurrence networks (DCN). A DCN can be used to study the function and interaction of proteins by representing protein domains and their co-existence in genes and by mapping cancer mutations to the individual protein domains to identify signals.ResultsThe domain co-occurrence network was constructed for the human proteome based on PFAM domains in proteins. Highly connected domains in the central cores were identified using the k-core decomposition technique. Here we show that these domains were found to be more evolutionarily conserved than the peripheral domains. The somatic mutations for ovarian, breast and prostate cancer diseases were obtained from the TCGA database. We mapped the somatic mutations to the individual protein domains and the local false discovery rate was used to identify significantly mutated domains in each cancer type. Significantly mutated domains were found to be enriched in cancer disease pathways. However, we found that the inner cores of the DCN did not contain any of the significantly mutated domains. We observed that the inner core protein domains are highly conserved and these domains co-exist in large numbers with other protein domains.ConclusionMutations and domain co-occurrence networks provide a framework for understanding hierarchal designs in protein function from a network perspective. This study provides evidence that a majority of protein domains in the inner core of the DCN have a lower mutation frequency and that protein domains present in the peripheral regions of the k-core contribute more heavily to the disease.

c3bfd346490a27c6d28c23c0c221bbbccdc801f3,A novel LncRNA-based prognostic score reveals TP53-dependent subtype of lung adenocarcinoma with poor survival.,"The prognostic signatures play an essential role in the era of personalised therapy for cancer patients including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Long noncoding RNA (LncRNA), a relatively novel class of RNA, has shown to play a crucial role in all the areas of cancer biology. Here, we developed and validated a robust LncRNA-based prognostic signature for LUAD patients using three different cohorts. In the discovery cohort, four LncRNAs were identified with 10% false discovery rate and a hazard ratio of >10 using univariate Cox regression analysis. A risk score, generated from the four LncRNAs' expression, was found to be a significant predictor of survival in the discovery and validation cohort (pâ€‰=â€‰9.97â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -8 and 1.41â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -3 , respectively). Further optimisation of four LncRNAs signature in the validation cohort, generated a three LncRNAs prognostic score (LPS), which was found to be an independent predictor of survival in both the cohorts ( pâ€‰=â€‰1.00â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -6 and 7.27â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -4 , respectively). The LPS also significantly divided survival in clinically important subsets, including Stage I ( pâ€‰=â€‰9.00â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -4 and 4.40â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -2 , respectively), KRAS wild-type (WT), KRAS mutant ( pâ€‰=â€‰4.00â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -3 and 4.30â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -2 , respectively) and EGFR WT ( pâ€‰=â€‰2.00â€‰Ã—â€‰10 -4 ). In multivariate analysis LPS outperformed, eight previous prognosticators. Further, individual members of LPS showed a significant correlation with survival in microarray data sets. Mutation analysis showed that high-LPS patients have a higher mutation rate and inactivation of the TP53 pathway. In summary, we identified and validated a novel LncRNA signature LPS for LUAD.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Pranjal Kumar"", ids = ""39384994""); list(name = ""Seema Khadirnaikar"", ids = ""31055067""); list(name = ""Sudhanshu Kumar Shukla"", ids = ""1778378"")",57efa1d1ce6e7951fe34e8e2e2d44200c5267e07,,Journal of cellular physiology,,
a5a892bf8e6c102a8826af2b42cfd3f37e3d4e7c,Abstract 421: Potential biomarkers for monitoring therapy with Denosumab in patients affected by giant cell tumor of bone,"Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) of Bone is an intramedullary tumor histologically composed by spindle-shaped mononuclear stromal cells, that are the neoplastic and proliferative component of the lesion, and osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, that express receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB (RANK). The mononuclear stromal cells express RANK ligand, a mediator of osteoclast activation. GCT represents 5% of all bone tumors and 20% of all benign tumors. It usually affects young adults and 2-3% is metastatic, generally to the lung. Curettage is the preferred surgery, while current therapeutic treatment is represented by Denosumab, an anti-RANK-L monoclonal antibody that blocks RANKL binding to RANK, thereby stopping the â€˜vicious cycleâ€™ involved in the biological process of GCT. Identification of circulating biomarkers could provide tools for monitoring the effectiveness of therapy and to better understand its biological mechanism. Low molecular weight (LMW) serum proteins or protein fragments, considered to be a rich source of new potential biomarkers and often masked by the presence of abundant proteins, were detected in serum of 25 GCT patients before and after 9 months of treatment with Denosumab, using the hydrogel nanoparticle technique followed by Mass Spectrometry (MS). 25 healthy sera were also analyzed. Hydrogel core-shell nanoparticles selectively entrap LMW proteins by size exclusion and affinity chromatography, protecting them from degradation and amplifying their concentration for subsequent MS detection. Statistical differences in LMW protein abundance between the three groups (GCT pre-treatment, GCT post-treatment, and healthy) were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate, with the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate for multiple test correction. Proteomic analysis revealed 14 differentially expressed analytes in sera from patients pre- and post-treatment, including Complement factor H, Immunoglobulin kappa variable 4-1, Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4, Insulin-like growth factor II, Beta-2-glycoprotein 1 and Immunoglobulin lambda constant 6, while 6 proteins were unaltered by the treatment. Furthermore, 52 proteins showed differential abundance in GCT patients before treatment compared to the healthy group, including several (Vitamin D binding protein, Ceruloplasmin, CD5 antigen-like, Serum amyloid A-4 protein, Complement factor D and Apolipoprotein B-100) that we previously identified in a smaller subset of GCT patients and controls, validating our former results. In conclusion, using a noninvasive proteomic technique, we have identified candidate serum biomarkers that could be useful to monitor Denosumab therapy in patients with GCT of bone, for patient management and to better understand its molecular mechanism.

b41c03b3d8458dda6aa53fb455f00586c8b526cd,The rs1800716 variant in CYP2D6 is associated with an increased double endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women on tamoxifen.,"BACKGROUND
Tamoxifen remains important in the treatment and prevention of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, it can lead to endometrial changes such as cystic appearances, hyperplasia, polyps and endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes to the more active metabolite endoxifen. Several genetic variants in the CYP450 enzymes reduce tamoxifen metabolism, leading to reduced endoxifen levels. We hypothesize that carriers of these variants, which are established poor metabolizers of tamoxifen, do not have the typical tamoxifen-induced increase in endometrial thickness. We test the association between genetic variability in CYP450 enzymes and the increase in double endometrial thickness (DET) as measured through transvaginal ultrasound (TVU).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We carried out a retrospective study on postmenopausal tamoxifen users for which germline DNA was available and at least one DET measurement was made between January 2000 and October 2011. Genotyping of 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP450 genes involved in tamoxifen metabolism was carried out using Sequenom MassARRAY. The association between these variants and TVU outcome (DET â‰¥5 mm) was assessed by proportional hazards regression.


RESULTS
Data were available for 184 women: 47 with a DET of <5 mm on all ultrasounds and 137 with a DET of â‰¥5 mm on at least one ultrasound. The rs1800716 variant in CYP2D6 showed a statistically significant association with DET. In particular, mutant carriers of rs1800716 had an increased chance of having a DET of â‰¥5 mm (P = 0.0022, false discovery rate 0.0179). None of the other variants were associated with DET.


CONCLUSION
Although mutant carriers of rs1800716 are characterized by reduced CYP2D6 enzyme activity and by low levels of endoxifen, we observed that mutant alleles of rs1800716 were associated with an increased chance of having a DET of â‰¥5 mm in postmenopausal women on tamoxifen. We conclude that the increase in endometrial thickness seen under tamoxifen cannot be used as a marker for favorable genotypes.

eccfbebc2d6981f31d326aaf84f34d65fe681d4d,Genome wide evolutionary analyses reveal serotype specific patterns of positive selection in selected Salmonella serotypes,"BackgroundThe bacterium Salmonella enterica includes a diversity of serotypes that cause disease in humans and different animal species. Some Salmonella serotypes show a broad host range, some are host restricted and exclusively associated with one particular host, and some are associated with one particular host species, but able to cause disease in other host species and are thus considered ""host adapted"". Five Salmonella genome sequences, representing a broad host range serotype (Typhimurium), two host restricted serotypes (Typhi [two genomes] and Paratyphi) and one host adapted serotype (Choleraesuis) were used to identify core genome genes that show evidence for recombination and positive selection.ResultsOverall, 3323 orthologous genes were identified in all 5 Salmonella genomes analyzed. Use of four different methods to assess homologous recombination identified 270 genes that showed evidence for recombination with at least one of these methods (false discovery rate [FDR] <10%). After exclusion of genes with evidence for recombination, site and branch specific models identified 41 genes as showing evidence for positive selection (FDR <20%), including a number of genes with confirmed or likely roles in virulence and ompC, a gene encoding an outer membrane protein, which has also been found to be under positive selection in other bacteria. A total of 8, 16, 7, and 5 genes showed evidence for positive selection in Choleraesuis, Typhi, Typhimurium, and Paratyphi branch analyses, respectively. Sequencing and evolutionary analyses of four genes in an additional 42 isolates representing 23 serotypes confirmed branch specific positive selection and recombination patterns.ConclusionOur data show that, among the four serotypes analyzed, (i) less than 10% of Salmonella genes in the core genome show evidence for homologous recombination, (ii) a number of Salmonella genes are under positive selection, including genes that appear to contribute to virulence, and (iii) branch specific positive selection contributes to the evolution of host restricted Salmonella serotypes.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""YeÅŸim Soyer"", ids = ""3755223""); list(name = ""Renato H.

59a92ceccc21f6e1b2423fece7199f1c0bb648c7,Reverse genomics analysis of ethylene regulation in apple fruit tissues.,"Ethylene-mediated regulation of fruit quality and nutritional attributes is a unique attribute of fruit development. We have defined a network of ethylene-regulated genes in transgenic apple fruit tissues obtained from plants silenced for ethylene biosynthesis. Using RNA from these fruit tissues and custom microarrays that contain 8,976 apple genes we examined differential gene expression patterns, identifying 3204 genes significantly (p < 0.05) regulated by ethylene. Of these, 57 were regulated by both ethylene and sorbitol, a key sugar synthesized during photosynthesis in many Rosaceae crops, including apple, which is translocated to fruit. We have classified (unsupervised) expression of these genes to define tissue-specific expression patterns and functional categories using Arabidopsis gene annotations. Defining these pathways and their regulation will provide a unique insight into how ethylene regulates complex traits like fruit quality, shelf-life, nutrition, flavor, disease, disorders, and fruit safety. INTRODUCTION Ethylene synthesis and perception are important regulators of fruit physiology and biochemistry. The gaseous hormone ethylene mediates expression of specific genes linked to ripening (Theologis 1994; Fluhr and Mattoo 1996) and stress (Kieber and Ecker 1993; Ecker 1995; Jackson 1997). We identified ethylene-responsive genes in apple fruit tissues during development. Ethylene synthesis requires two enzymes, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO). We used transgenic apple trees from our transgenic orchard that have been silenced for each of these enzymes (Dandekar et al., 2004). Two lines produce very little ethylene: 68G expresses antisense ACC oxidase (ACO) and 103Y expresses a sense version of apple ACC synthase (ACS). The study design incorporated 1) transgenic apple fruits modified in the capacity to synthesize endogenous ethylene and 2) application of 1methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), an ethylene action inhibitor. These resulted in distinct phenotypes (Dandekar et al., 2004; Defilippi et al 2004; Defilippi et al., 2005a; 2005b). Fruit was harvested at a preclimacteric stage before the onset of system 2 ethylene formation and kept at 20C for 14 days. Transgenic lines 68G and 103Y were incubated with and without ethylene; controls were incubated with or without 1-MCP (Fig 1, adapted from our earlier publication). These nine treatments allowed us to define the ethylene-responsive genes. Autocatalytic ethylene biosynthesis was found in wild type controls at day 14 but not in the transgenics. METHODS We studied the transcriptome using the CombiMatrix custom 12K platform. The manufacturer synthesized oligonucleotide probes representing 8,976 apple genes on the chip surface before delivery. The probes represented apple unigene entries in 34 fruit libraries from GenBank: 8813 sequences from the apple UniGene build #14 (05 Apr 2006) with an additional 163 genes of interest. Of 12,395 microarray probes, 474 (4%) were controls and 11,921 (96%) were apple UniGenespecific probes. Functional categories of these apple genes are outlined (Fig 2). We isolated RNA from peel and cortex tissues of the nine treatments (Fig 1) and labeled it using the standard one color biotin labeling kit. We performed 36 hybridizations. RNA samples were prepared from untreated controls after 14 days at 20C (14-GS-UN), 1-MCP treated controls after 14 days at 20C (14GS-T), transgenic line 68G untreated after 14 days at 20C (14-68G-UN), transgenic line 68G gassed with ethylene after 14 days at 20C (14-68G-T), transgenic line 103Y untreated after 14 days at 20C (14-103Y-UN), and transgenic line 103Y gassed with ethylene after 14 days at 20C (14-103Y-T). Three biological replications of two tissues (cortex and peel) were analyzed for each fruit. The hybridization, imaging, stripping, and re-hybridization were performed at the ArrayCore facility at UC Davis per the CombiMatrix protocol (www.combimatrix.com/docs/PTL006_00_12K_Hyb_Imaging.pdf). Using a GenePix scanner and software, microarrays were scanned and spots were manually aligned to the grid supplied by CombiMatrix. The resulting raw intensities were preprocessed with global median scaling normalization and background subtraction (average of the lowest 5% of control probe signals) to obtain the gene expression matrix. A one-way ANOVA was applied to each gene using R package LMGene. Standard errors were modified using empirical Bayes methods. The resulting p-values were BH adjusted (Benjamini and Hochberg 2000) for multiple hypothesis testing. Genes with adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We identified 3,204 genes that were differentially regulated by ethylene. Of these, 71% (2,270) were expressed in peel, 22% were expressed in cortex, and 7% were expressed in both (Fig 3). In peel, 1,196 genes (37%) responded to both ethylene and 1-MCP and 1,074 genes (34%) responded only to ethylene. In cortex, 321 genes (10%) responded to both ethylene and 1-MCP and 387 (12%) responded only to ethylene. Of genes expressed in both peel and cortex, 127 (4%) responded to both ethylene and 1-MCP and 99 (3%) responded only to ethylene. Pairwise comparisons for each of the six treatments (14-GS-UN, 14-GS-T, 14-68G-UN, 1468G-T, 14-103Y-UN, and 14-103Y-T) contain both upand down-regulated genes. The highest number of differentially expressed genes occurred when comparing transgenics to either the control (14-GS-UN) or the control treated with 1-MCP (14-GS-T). Peel was much more transcriptionally active than cortex. The complexity of gene expression patterns was also higher in peel. We comparred gene sequences to the Arabidopsis TAIR database to assign each gene to a functional category based on Arabidopsis gene annotations. The functional catogories and the number of differentially expressed genes in each are shown (Fig 4). Several genes in important functional categories like hormone metabolism, protein degradation, secondary metabolism, signaling, stress, and transport are regulated either up or down by ethylene. This supervised analysis is essential to define pathways and their regulatory networks, the first step toward unique insight into how ethylene regulates complex traits like fruit quality, shelf-life, nutrition, flavor, disease, disorders, and fruit safety.

428c957a3880fe4fa1bb98d7d47eeb4d997498b1,Comparison of Merging and Meta-Analysis as Alternative Approaches for Integrative Gene Expression Analysis,"An increasing amount of microarray gene expression data sets is available through public repositories. Their huge potential in making new findings is yet to be unlocked by making them available for large-scale analysis. In order to do so it is essential that independent studies designed for similar biological problems can be integrated, so that new insights can be obtained. These insights would remain undiscovered when analyzing the individual data sets because it is well known that the small number of biological samples used per experiment is a bottleneck in genomic analysis. By increasing the number of samples the statistical power is increased and more general and reliable conclusions can be drawn. In this work, two different approaches for conducting large-scale analysis of microarray gene expression data-meta-analysis and data merging-are compared in the context of the identification of cancer-related biomarkers, by analyzing six independent lung cancer studies. Within this study, we investigate the hypothesis that analyzing large cohorts of samples resulting in merging independent data sets designed to study the same biological problem results in lower false discovery rates than analyzing the same data sets within a more conservative meta-analysis approach.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonatan Taminau"", ids = ""2806063""); list(name = ""Cosmin Lazar"", ids = ""34804587""); list(name = ""Stijn Meganck"", ids = ""1967259""); list(name = ""A.

eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22,"False discovery rate, sensitivity and sample size for microarray studies","MOTIVATION
In microarray data studies most researchers are keenly aware of the potentially high rate of false positives and the need to control it. One key statistical shift is the move away from the well-known P-value to false discovery rate (FDR). Less discussion perhaps has been spent on the sensitivity or the associated false negative rate (FNR). The purpose of this paper is to explain in simple ways why the shift from P-value to FDR for statistical assessment of microarray data is necessary, to elucidate the determining factors of FDR and, for a two-sample comparative study, to discuss its control via sample size at the design stage.


RESULTS
We use a mixture model, involving differentially expressed (DE) and non-DE genes, that captures the most common problem of finding DE genes. Factors determining FDR are (1) the proportion of truly differentially expressed genes, (2) the distribution of the true differences, (3) measurement variability and (4) sample size. Many current small microarray studies are plagued with large FDR, but controlling FDR alone can lead to unacceptably large FNR. In evaluating a design of a microarray study, sensitivity or FNR curves should be computed routinely together with FDR curves. Under certain assumptions, the FDR and FNR curves coincide, thus simplifying the choice of sample size for controlling the FDR and FNR jointly.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yudi Pawitan"", ids = ""2445755"");

43c1a8732850aae435c10fd21e34335625c7fa67,CACNA1C polymorphisms are associated with the efficacy of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of hypertension.,"Retrospective pharmacogenetic analysis was performed on 120 Caucasian subjects. Subjects were obtained in collaboration with the Estonian Genome Project and Egeen Inc. (CA, USA), who provided blinded medical record and genetic data to the researchers, respectively. Subjects selected from the Estonian Genome Project had a diagnosis of hypertension confirmed by at least two blood pressure measurements and multiple follow-up measurements for assessing calcium channel blocker antihypertensive treatment outcome. Treatment outcome was scored positive if at least three follow-up blood pressure measurements were nonhypertensive and no more than one follow-up measurement was hypertensive (>140/90). The genotypes of 62 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calcium channel, voltage-dependent, L type, alpha 1C subunit (CACNA1C) gene were obtained for each subject from a blood sample.

00f666fea7977a2f53e27d37ec162fa31b42fba7,NCI60 Cancer Cell Line Panel Data and RNAi Analysis Help Identify EAF2 as a Modulator of Simvastatin and Lovastatin Response in HCT-116 Cells,"Simvastatin and lovastatin are statins traditionally used for lowering serum cholesterol levels. However, there exists evidence indicating their potential chemotherapeutic characteristics in cancer. In this study, we used bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data in order to systematically identify the genes involved in resistance to cytotoxic effects of these two drugs in the NCI60 cell line panel. We used the pharmacological data available for all the NCI60 cell lines to classify simvastatin or lovastatin resistant and sensitive cell lines, respectively. Next, we performed whole-genome single marker case-control association tests for the lovastatin and simvastatin resistant and sensitive cells using their publicly available Affymetrix 125K SNP genomic data. The results were then evaluated using RNAi methodology. After correction of the p-values for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate, our results identified three genes (NRP1, COL13A1, MRPS31) and six genes (EAF2, ANK2, AKAP7, STEAP2, LPIN2, PARVB) associated with resistance to simvastatin and lovastatin, respectively. Functional validation using RNAi confirmed that silencing of EAF2 expression modulated the response of HCT-116 colon cancer cells to both statins. In summary, we have successfully utilized the publicly available data on the NCI60 cell lines to perform whole-genome association studies for simvastatin and lovastatin. Our results indicated genes involved in the cellular response to these statins and siRNA studies confirmed the role of the EAF2 in response to these drugs in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sevtap Savas"", ids = ""2012731""); list(name = ""David O Azorsa"", ids = ""4661689""); list(name = ""Hamdi Jarjanazi"", ids = ""4500788""); list(name = ""Irada Ibrahim-zada"", ids = ""1398560910""); list(name = ""Irma M.

034ca729a4ca68017150ea28aba4916746ee0793,Estradiol Treatment Initiated Early After Ovariectomy Regulates Myocardial Gene Expression and Inhibits Diastolic Dysfunction in Female Cynomolgus Monkeys: Potential Roles for Calcium Homeostasis and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling,"Background Left ventricular ( LV ) diastolic dysfunction often precedes heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the dominant form of heart failure in postmenopausal women. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of oral estradiol treatment initiated early after ovariectomy on LV function and myocardial gene expression in female cynomolgus macaques. Methods and Results Monkeys were ovariectomized and randomized to receive placebo (control) or oral estradiol at a human-equivalent dose of 1Â mg/day for 8Â months. Monkeys then underwent conventional and tissue Doppler imaging to assess cardiac function, followed by transcriptomic and histomorphometric analyses of LV myocardium. Age, body weight, blood pressure, and heart rate were similar between groups. Echocardiographic mitral early and late inflow velocities, mitral annular velocities, and mitral E deceleration slope were higher in estradiol monkeys (all P<0.05), despite similar estimated LV filling pressure. MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and LV collagen staining were lower in estradiol animals ( P<0.05). Microarray analysis revealed differential myocardial expression of 40 genes (>1.2-fold change; false discovery rate, P<0.05) in estradiol animals relative to controls, which implicated pathways associated with better calcium ion homeostasis and muscle contraction and lower extracellular matrix deposition ( P<0.05). Conclusions Estradiol treatment initiated soon after ovariectomy resulted in enhanced LV diastolic function, and altered myocardial gene expression towards decreased extracellular matrix deposition, improved myocardial contraction, and calcium homeostasis, suggesting that estradiol directly or indirectly modulates the myocardial transcriptome to preserve cardiovascular function.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristofer T.

We employ JRA-55, a recent second-generation global reanalysis providing data of high-quality in the stratosphere, to examine whether a distinguishable effect of geomagnetic activity on northern hemisphere stratospheric temperatures can be detected. We focus on how the statistical significance of stratospheric temperature differences may be robustly assessed during years with high and low geomagnetic activity. Two problems must be overcome. The first is the temporal autocorrelation of the data, which is addressed with a correction of the t-statistics by means of the estimate of the number of independent values in the series of correlated values. The second is the problem of multiplicity due to strong spatial autocorrelations, which is addressed by means of a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. We find that the statistical tests fail to formally reject the null hypothesis, i.e. no significant response to geomagnetic activity can be found in the seasonal-mean northern-hemisphere stratospheric temperature record.",2019,Physics,"list(name = ""Nazario Tartaglione"", ids = ""9113132""); list(name = ""Thomas Toniazzo"", ids = ""40481538""); list(name = ""Yvan Joseph Orsolini"", ids = ""12366657""); list(name = ""Odd Helge OtterÃ¥"", ids = ""88923889"")",,bdc093edbb4a6379f0cfeabf5e77b41c46dcac74; 6995c5f0a496ffcebd1182bdbf2cd617e931ee63; 5d072be87fb7f7cfa672623c9326db7d0b012539; 54d4fb442d26bbdcb4aaf9c71ce5ed6677cab4e9; eb46c21e38e8c496e7dc2b1bf29009c6e0c2823d; b5ccb26484bccc4472e93e51ef8c5e4a5ac518c8; 7664559ce97daaa06d066f6c74aef1543907d9b6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9b2acbc8611cc8ec8683f75d35bdd05a0318058d; 81c0c98b1f64a7634f0ab348abdd26870e4030a4; 56e4fdf41c16433ebdeaaff59169587eadfef09e; dae89b5a782ea6354c8b6a43c10c125228663ed3; 68482ce95fd95e9fbd08237a2a92f91e86bc77a6; 6882612be629511babf118a631edd733f9886f41,Annales Geophysicae,,1-14
05fb636bd19dae312f98aaf23de0ac823a022b54,iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the distinct early embryo myofiber type characteristics involved in landrace and miniature pig,"BackgroundPig (Sus scrofa) is a major source of dietary proteins for human consumption and is becoming a valuable model in agricultural and biomedical research. The recently developed isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) method allows sensitive and accurate protein quantification. Here, we performed the first iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analyses of Landrace (LR) and Wuzhishan (WZS) pig longissimus dorsi muscle tissues during early embryonic development.ResultsThe iTRAQ-based early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle study of LR and WZS ranging from 21 to 42Â days post coitus (dpc) identified a total of 4431 proteins from17,214 peptides, which were matched with 36,4025 spectra at a false discovery rate of 5Â %. In both WZS and LR, the largest amount of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found between 28 and 35 dpc. 252 breed-DEPs were selected by GO analysis, including 8 myofibrillar proteins. Only MYHCI/IIA mRNA were detected due to early embryonic stages, and significantly higher expression of them were found in WZS during these 4 stages. MYHCI was first found in WZS at 28 dpc and expressed in both breeds at later stages, while MYHCII protein was not detected until 35 dpc in both breeds. Thus, 33 myogenic breed-DEPs selected from last two stages were analyzed by STRING, which showed that some myofibrillar proteins (MYH1, TPM4, MYH10, etc.) and functional proteins (CSRP2, CASQ2, OTC, etc.), together with candidate myogenic proteins (H3F3A, HDGFRP2, etc.), probably participate in the regulatory network of myofiber formation.ConclusionOur iTRAQ-based early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle study of LR and WZS provides new data on the in vivo muscle development distinctions during early embryonic development, which contributes to the improved understanding in the regulation mechanism of early myogenesis in agricultural animals.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xumeng Zhang"", ids = ""3555077""); list(name = ""Yaosheng Chen"", ids = ""49069910""); list(name = ""Jinchun Pan"", ids = ""6869947""); list(name = ""Xiaohong Liu"", ids = ""5017725""); list(name = ""Hu Chen"", ids = ""51516709""); list(name = ""Xingyu Zhou"", ids = ""48667371""); list(name = ""Zhuning Yuan"", ids = ""116714065""); list(name = ""Xilong Wang"", ids = ""48630778""); list(name = ""Delin Mo"", ids = ""145128897"")",ca09fd2d7f7a19918c358b9008d7eee925e1dfb1; a5df7d147965f4f8dbfb530639ce5b23cb255436; 1ecce069b44d517b790130001627626e0e6d6045; 93507716d80b9834a1ee584b038c1be54c0790a8; 15b2e23fbde1edad1ea4b4ce861fcb2070255da7; f570272751f0e0a9333db888eddc88713ebe8cc3; 906da3d86d96a5606d367942685253fd03c598fd,acdbf5397152b7ed913e48da8873fd736fa42202; 26770fd4da6153be05a35fe513ae5f92eae692e4; 2ce7bae99000c0efc657060678688ae5e3b75be3; 634ee889521af0005055c5f797ef0e2f2fc5d99c; 40cb2f2c1e9a51c517644f02a8cc71f1d3f64328; d1b3a0e464fb8e42888377a99a29510e4c521b7c; 9887a78c6587b396906e1929e669686e83377e47; 82917974ccda1e320e696cee97ed56f7751602a0; ef22ffa1e78ced5d916d6c3d52799cf30095af1b; 134c0c952fe36b0cea5bef8d65c06c7a49b97763; 68878be9b0643cadf9f68030deae197e08f5fa5d; 618a4291e1257ca082554e9bc08f50233f4e452d; 282a106270c7b8431efd5fe86b8018a811b2d050; a2cc2e2eebdc9856064700965f9f7b894ffbeae8; 956f55a2bbdf94ea207476d3c355f08cc38a9238; a7451a8f0c9817af3258ab5022b8616405e6ccf1; 43a00ac234e78f1f312ace5667f3c18adf419871; 7f80cf37575d04511d528d13f767e8d167deda65; 0da9f2bf99f7c733f1ab00f02393e22a8bef6e43; ab11699ffb292143db055dfab73bba196df14bd8; e8ddf17337f098c4cf74dbe9fa9ab31d7dcf6f3f; 2b4970e07b5c004ceefaea0b2fd7e596c1adce69; fdf886cf6481bd2766f8dc12c77c9c0f1e736a50; 20ab1ce448f742c7fa7467e97ae3408838249359; a1e50eb1e7a8794d76e68e8b3053ea738612484c; 8ad21f7927b742b3b6c8baf57e6e3371e5fe8bfb; 83bef9b40321946aa9f0bdb4d52e0455a8fa8ae8; 45084e2b88a3fb5b1494868ebc997d452d16af5d; 4fd7a6eab9b5861337b44609448ee3eaa1d69d3b; 31715ad3996ec920a4fcea2040ba191ca0941111; e027fbd2302d5b8afbf847c170d553736d71a9e6; 422fa98e1bf20e6b2e7f45163e138ddacb70e3d2; 2c5070bd670a5dd4f6310995d1c610ab09f85db8; 3e5787706bd66ef2862b6915a71986602219a428; 198e8d7fb21f245f48da34ba1463fcc3b13b8dec; b24eb636c40849023a501d7a0ffa69aef08276d3; c9aac4397bda4c772da036e1b6c3634bb9b88112; f22dd975dec76372d7ab53967ea3a4bbf3c63d4c; fd970e94c5eaf35e656eeabfdc59a56bbf8d3b38; 27ff8a0bae0304e63592483d3a338c19b5fb2dd0; 37b5594ace6dd6da4d8b053ea5f9e83dfb48aa5a; f66ed9f0d864787677761ddfdf0f6dbf24926ee5; a8601de90b969f2927c77bd52d337727583e5565,BMC Genomics,17,
5e9165341caf977b76f67ebe050e5a9dd746f871,Epigenetics Predicts Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 Response to Vitamin D3 Supplementation in African Americans.,"SCOPE
The effects of vitamin D3 supplementations on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D] are varied. We tested the hypothesis that the baseline DNA methylation plays a role in the serum 25(OH)D response to vitamin D3 supplementation.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A randomized clinical trial was previously conducted among 64 African Americans, who were randomly assigned to a placebo or a 16-week treatment of 600, 2000, 4000 IU/day of vitamin D3 supplements. Expected serum 25(OH)D concentrations at posttest were estimated by intervention, age, gender, body mass index, baseline 25(OH)D concentrations and seasonal variations. The 25(OH)D response was categorized into a high-response group when the actual 25(OH)D concentrations at posttest were higher than expected, and a low-response group otherwise. The 25(OH)D response was associated with baseline methylation levels of CYP family and VDR genes (raw pÂ <Â 0.05). At a genome-wide level, the baseline methylation level of cg07873128 [OSBPL5] that regulates cholesterol balance and calcium homeostasis, was higher in the low-response group (false discovery rateÂ =Â 0.028).


CONCLUSIONS
The baseline methylation levels of CYP family and VDR modulate 25(OH)D response. In addition, the hypermethylation of cg07873128 at the baseline, which is located in the imprinted gene OSBPL5, might reduce the serum 25(OH)D response to vitamin D3 supplementation.

4714548b587f976640e0ef4eefe0e974f28988c0,Hierarchical topological network analysis of anatomical human brain connectivity and differences related to sex and kinship,"Modern non-invasive brain imaging technologies, such as diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), enable the mapping of neural fiber tracts in the white matter, providing a basis to reconstruct a detailed map of brain structural connectivity networks. Brain connectivity networks differ from random networks in their topology, which can be measured using small worldness, modularity, and high-degree nodes (hubs). Still, little is known about how individual differences in structural brain network properties relate to age, sex, or genetic differences. Recently, some groups have reported brain network biomarkers that enable differentiation among individuals, pairs of individuals, and groups of individuals. In addition to studying new topological features, here we provide a unifying general method to investigate topological brain networks and connectivity differences between individuals, pairs of individuals, and groups of individuals at several levels of the data hierarchy, while appropriately controlling false discovery rate (FDR) errors. We apply our new method to a large dataset of high quality brain connectivity networks obtained from High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) tractography in 303 young adult twins, siblings, and unrelated people. Our proposed approach can accurately classify brain connectivity networks based on sex (93% accuracy) and kinship (88.5% accuracy). We find statistically significant differences associated with sex and kinship both in the brain connectivity networks and in derived topological metrics, such as the clustering coefficient and the communicability matrix.",2012,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julio Martin Duarte-Carvajalino"", ids = ""1397244014""); list(name = ""Neda Jahanshad"", ids = ""1721831""); list(name = ""Christophe Lenglet"", ids = ""2997374""); list(name = ""Katie L.

6b25ade0c5ddc29ae37f6eb2e06677eb476464a1,ModÃ¨les de mÃ©lange semi-paramÃ©triques et applications aux tests multiples,"Dans un contexte de test multiple, nous considerons un modele de melange semi-parametrique avec deux composantes. Une composante est supposee connue et correspond a la distribution des p-valeurs sous hypothese nulle avec probabilite a priori p. L'autre composante f est nonparametrique et represente la distribution des p-valeurs sous l'hypothese alternative. Le probleme d'estimer les parametres p et f du modele apparait dans les procedures de controle du taux de faux positifs (``false discovery rate'' ou FDR). Dans la premiere partie de cette dissertation, nous etudions l'estimation de la proportion p. Nous discutons de resultats d'efficacite asymptotique et etablissons que deux cas differents arrivent suivant que f s'annule ou non surtout un intervalle non-vide. Dans le premier cas (annulation surtout un intervalle), nous presentons des estimateurs qui convergent \`{a} la vitesse parametrique, calculons la variance asymptotique optimale et conjecturons qu'aucun estimateur n'est asymptotiquement efficace (i.e atteint la variance asymptotique optimale). Dans le deuxieme cas, nous prouvons que le risque quadratique de n'importe quel estimateur ne converge pas a la vitesse parametrique. Dans la deuxieme partie de la dissertation, nous nous concentrons sur l'estimation de la composante inconnue nonparametrique f dans le melange, en comptant sur un estimateur preliminaire de p. Nous proposons et etudions les proprietes asymptotiques de deux estimateurs differents pour cette composante inconnue. Le premier estimateur est un estimateur a noyau avec poids aleatoires. Nous etablissons une borne superieure pour son risque quadratique ponctuel, en montrant une vitesse de convergence nonparametrique classique sur une classe de Holder. Le deuxieme estimateur est un estimateur du maximum de vraisemblance regularisee. Il est calcule par un algorithme iteratif, pour lequel nous etablissons une propriete de decroissance d'un critere. De plus, ces estimateurs sont utilises dans une procedure de test multiple pour estimer le taux local de faux positifs (``local false discovery rate'' ou lfdr).",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Van Hanh Nguyen"", ids = ""47371317"")",,,,,
7ccef11554371e1560f0cdc8bd2b740ec6110df3,Pathway analysis of breast cancer genome-wide association study highlights three pathways and one canonical signaling cascade.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focus on relatively few highly significant loci, whereas less attention is given to other genotyped markers. Using pathway analysis to study existing GWAS data may shed light on relevant biological processes and illuminate new candidate genes. We applied a pathway-based approach to the breast cancer GWAS data of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility project that includes 1,145 cases and 1,142 controls. Pathways were retrieved from three databases: KEGG, BioCarta, and NCI Protein Interaction Database. Genes were represented by their most strongly associated SNP, and an enrichment score reflecting the overrepresentation of gene-based association signals in each pathway was calculated by using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov procedure. Finally, hierarchical clustering was used to identify pathways with overlapping genes, and clusters with an excess of association signals were determined by the adaptive rank-truncated product (ARTP) method. A total of 421 pathways containing 3,962 genes was included in our study. Of these, three pathways (syndecan-1-mediated signaling, signaling of hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and growth hormone signaling) were highly enriched with association signals [P(ES) < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.118]. Our clustering analysis revealed that pathways containing key components of the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase canonical signaling cascade were significantly more likely to have an excess of association signals than expected by chance (P(ARTP) = 0.0051, FDR = 0.07). These results suggest that genetic alterations associated with these three pathways and one canonical signaling cascade may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Idan Menashe"", ids = ""1837051""); list(name = ""Dennis Maeder"", ids = ""4901328""); list(name = ""Montserrat GarcÃ­a-Closas"", ids = ""1399642812""); list(name = ""Jonine D Figueroa"", ids = ""145917271""); list(name = ""Samsiddhi Bhattacharjee"", ids = ""38097941""); list(name = ""Melissa Rotunno"", ids = ""3797310""); list(name = ""Peter Kraft"", ids = ""145248415""); list(name = ""David J.

5303d297a5a51c05e55933da1c0bfbcc8dc18fe5,Nasal gene expression differentiates COPD from controls and overlaps bronchial gene expression,"BackgroundNasal gene expression profiling is a promising method to characterize COPD non-invasively. We aimed to identify a nasal gene expression profile to distinguish COPD patients from healthy controls. We investigated whether this COPD-associated gene expression profile in nasal epithelium is comparable with the profile observed in bronchial epithelium.MethodsGenome wide gene expression analysis was performed on nasal epithelial brushes of 31 severe COPD patients and 22 controls, all current smokers, using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. We repeated the gene expression analysis on bronchial epithelial brushes in 2 independent cohorts of mild-to-moderate COPD patients and controls.ResultsIn nasal epithelium, 135 genes were significantly differentially expressed between severe COPD patients and controls, 21 being up- and 114 downregulated in COPD (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed significant concordant enrichment of COPD-associated nasal and bronchial gene expression in both independent cohorts (FDRGSEAÂ <â€‰0.001).ConclusionWe identified a nasal gene expression profile that differentiates severe COPD patients from controls. Of interest, part of the nasal gene expression changes in COPD mimics differentially expressed genes in the bronchus. These findings indicate that nasal gene expression profiling is potentially useful as a non-invasive biomarker in COPD.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT01351792 (registration date May 10, 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00848406 (registration date February 19, 2009), ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT00807469 (registration date December 11, 2008).",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ilse M Boudewijn"", ids = ""9808315""); list(name = ""Alen Faiz"", ids = ""6922979""); list(name = ""Katrina Steiling"", ids = ""50489123""); list(name = ""Erica van der Wiel"", ids = ""115523446""); list(name = ""Eef D.

ae2cae3892bdc7fda1183b55cda6abe963528ad1,The cognitive phenotype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy,"OBJECTIVE
Dysexecutive traits have been described in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), but studies mainly focused on juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). To better understand the neuropsychology of IGE, more research is needed on syndromes other than JME, controlling potential confounding factors as the cognitive effects of valproate and epileptic discharges (ED). We describe the neuropsychological profile of a group of patients with different syndromes of IGE including simultaneous video electroencephalography (EEG).


METHODS
We performed a comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric evaluation with video-EEG on 61 adults with IGE (JME 19; IGE with generalized tonic-clonic seizures [GTCS] alone [IGE-GTCS] 22; childhood absence epilepsy [CAE] or juvenile absences epilepsy [JAE] persisting in adulthood 20). We compared results between patients (globally and by syndrome) and a control group of 21 individuals (similar age, educational level); p-values were adjusted for multiple testing according to a 0.05 false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Patients obtained significantly lower results than controls on visuospatial working memory, processing speed, cognitive flexibility and strategy, abstract visuospatial reasoning, arithmetic, and acquired knowledge. While CAE/JAE showed the lowest scores on cognitive assessment and highest anxiety index, IGE-GTCS showed the most favorable scores. Most tests were not influenced by valproate intake, and the dose did not correlate with cognitive performance in the test that yielded differences between patients and controls. Epileptic discharges during assessment were not frequent (10 patients, 1-4 tests).


SIGNIFICANCE
Our findings suggest that patients with IGE have significantly lower abilities in various executive functions and acquired knowledge, compared to population of same age and education. The low frequency of ED on simultaneous video-EEG and absence of correlation of scores with valproate dose reinforce that the obtained results are due to a cognitive phenotype in IGE. This phenotype may be influenced by syndrome, and patients with CAE/JAE persisting in the adult may have a wider neuropsychiatric impairment.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""BelÃ©n Abarrategui"", ids = ""11413095""); list(name = ""Beatriz Parejo-Carbonell"", ids = ""1404673989""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Eugenia GarcÃ­a GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""34552462""); list(name = ""Daniela Di Capua"", ids = ""6223812""); list(name = ""Irene GarcÃ­a-Morales"", ids = ""150134051"")",72f6ac53857ab1876795d41cd5a6d4aeeefc1bc0; 5e03ce01b4a7439ede8c43a31dbb8da877f710de,,Epilepsy & Behavior,89,99-104
4b45fc6c1915b083faf0493cb5370894d2363e80,StPeter: Seamless Label-Free Quantification with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.,"Label-free quantification has grown in popularity as a means of obtaining relative abundance measures for proteomics experiments. However, easily accessible and integrated tools to perform label-free quantification have been lacking. We describe StPeter, an implementation of Normalized Spectral Index quantification for wide availability through integration into the widely used Trans-Proteomic Pipeline. This implementation has been specifically designed for reproducibility and ease of use. We demonstrate that StPeter outperforms other state-of-the art packages using a recently reported benchmark data set over the range of false discovery rates relevant to shotgun proteomics results. We also demonstrate that the software is computationally efficient and supports data from a variety of instrument platforms and experimental designs. Results can be viewed within the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline graphical user interfaces and exported in standard formats for downstream statistical analysis. By integrating StPeter into the freely available Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, users can now obtain high-quality label-free quantification of any data set in seconds by adding a single command to the workflow.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael R.

5e8b672e8dca8d92d24a3df1f93efdd703ad9e05,LVP extraction and triplet-based segmentation for diabetic retinopathy recognition,"Till now, the detection of diabetic retinopathy seems to be one of the sensitive research topics since it is related to health care of any individual. A number of contributions in terms of detection already exists in the dice; still, there present some problems regarding the detection accuracy. This issue motivates to develop a new detection model of diabetic retinopathy, and moreover, this model tells the severity of retinopathy from the given fundus image. The proposed model includes preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification stages. Here, Triplet Half band Filterbank (THFB) Segmentation is performed, local vector pattern (LVP) is used for extracting the features, principle component analysis (PCA) procedure is used to reduce the dimensions of the feature vector, and neural network (NN) is used for classification purpose. The proposed model compares its performance over other conventional classifiers like support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Navies Bayes (NB) in terms of positive and negative measures. The positive measures are accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, negative predictive value (NPV), F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Similarly, the negative measures are the false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR) and false discovery rate (FDR), and the efficiency of the proposed model is proven.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Santosh Nagnath Randive"", ids = ""143802559""); list(name = ""Amol D.

2b06a8fec9b1be23431b1fb603456156981fd87d,Discovery of False Identification Using Similarity Difference in GC-MS based Metabolomics.,"Compound identification is a critical process in metabolomics. The widely used approach for compound identification in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics is the spectrum matching, in which the mass spectral similarity between an experimental mass spectrum and each mass spectrum in a reference library is calculated. While various similarity measures have been developed to improve the overall accuracy of compound identification, little attention has been paid to reducing the false discovery rate. We, therefore, develop an approach for controlling false identification rate using the distribution of the difference between the first and the second highest spectral similarity scores. We further propose a model-based approach to achieving a desired true positive rate. The developed method is applied to the NIST mass spectral library and its performance is compared with the conventional approach that uses only the maximum spectral similarity score. The results show that the developed method achieves a significantly higher F1 score and positive predictive value than those of the conventional approach.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Seong-ho Kim"", ids = ""48388581""); list(name = ""Xiang Zhang"", ids = ""1686870"")",45ccd4a3919ca1327c98936d17534c8dbbc01efe; e59f4a3ff0c3f70a9430a6d03e431c4492401116; cc5f9867453c9559167568385ed3a5d6c01ef73c,031d426c6e35947c6f0189ca1751d83e9ddabf50; 48aa175135a93f94aa203573fe187c9cfc3318da; b6555fd29e600171146d70ff7be22355689f57e4; c505e9384d252503ba78953d8382d81414de67ca; bdec6d66394acf109de740c6145113c96c218fce; cda7277f42b66e8c4afd732345ecd6d13a7e855e; 81d8e8831aed4420014ac498f5f5d42342d9af41; feb72b53c4833cd88f5085caf2b82936ff023ffd; 9ba6d63500e0422da89d8a0127bb7b414f597230; 6482e8b42bd7321ee7f234a1b6666e6edba95038; efc79a3f2ba72856e65acd39f0232501f44db0f4,Journal of chemometrics,29 2,"

ab51bce59de790cc33ef7fac6468bcbaac3447b8,Framework for the Statistical Shape Analysis of Brain Structures using SPHARM-PDM.,"Shape analysis has become of increasing interest to the neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes between healthy and pathological structures. This manuscript presents a comprehensive set of tools for the computation of 3D structural statistical shape analysis. It has been applied in several studies on brain morphometry, but can potentially be employed in other 3D shape problems. Its main limitations is the necessity of spherical topology.The input of the proposed shape analysis is a set of binary segmentation of a single brain structure, such as the hippocampus or caudate. These segmentations are converted into a corresponding spherical harmonic description (SPHARM), which is then sampled into a triangulated surfaces (SPHARM-PDM). After alignment, differences between groups of surfaces are computed using the Hotelling T(2) two sample metric. Statistical p-values, both raw and corrected for multiple comparisons, result in significance maps. Additional visualization of the group tests are provided via mean difference magnitude and vector maps, as well as maps of the group covariance information.The correction for multiple comparisons is performed via two separate methods that each have a distinct view of the problem. The first one aims to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false-positives via the extrema histogram of non-parametric permutations. The second method controls the false discovery rate and results in a less conservative estimate of the false-negatives.",2006,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin Styner"", ids = ""143755814""); list(name = ""Ipek Oguz"", ids = ""47712388""); list(name = ""Shun Zhi Xu"", ids = ""48923019""); list(name = ""Christian BrechbÃ¼hler"", ids = ""2860318""); list(name = ""Dimitrios Pantazis"", ids = ""8152383""); list(name = ""James J.

b88072eb3742cf56dcc52d9f6c19c0d19ccc9ae2,msCRUSH: fast tandem mass spectra clustering using locality sensitive hashing,"Large-scale proteomics projects often generate massive and highly redundant tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra. Spectra clustering algorithms can reduce the redundancy in these datasets, and thus speed up the database searching for peptide identification, a major bottleneck for proteomic data analysis. Furthermore, the consensus spectra derived from highly similar MS/MS spectra in the same cluster may enhance the signal peaks while reduce the noise peaks, and thus will improve the sensitivity of peptide identification. In this paper, we present the software msCRUSH, which implemented a novel spectra clustering algorithm based on the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) technique. When tested on a large-scale proteomic dataset consisting of 18.4 million spectra (including 11.5 million spectra of charge 2+), msCRUSH runs 7.6-12.1x faster than the state-of-the-art spectra clustering software, PRIDE Cluster, while achieves higher clustering sensitivity and comparable accuracy. Using the consensus spectra reported by msCRUSH, commonly used spectra search engines MSGF+ and Mascot can identify 5% and 4% more unique peptides, respectively, comparing to the identification results from the raw MS/MS spectra at the same false discovery rate (1% FDR) of peptides. msCRUSH is implemented in C++, and is released as open source software.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Lei Wang"", ids = ""145131943""); list(name = ""Sujun Li"", ids = ""50341529""); list(name = ""Haixu Tang"", ids = ""40145425"")",,0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; eb24c5f753873470ab1fe111bfb35c8ea383cc8f; 0943f852b18c019d988c5b14ab4988408d237da7; e45a8d7176bd738c1e63de1f6791a88e704f8b4b; 1866b18786a59d57fa04a42167ebdae10d1d1e8e; 706f48658642687faf8bde3ce63c792762ac76e6; 500695c14cfad6f147f685617bfe6be3535d1675; 89dcddec20bf68c609eaa843065c727a22dadaae; 1f50f651b32791d4d9e44d99dda8fa8c92bd35e7; 9c911ed483237893c68d37885f88bc046a602e0f; 6a2eb37046f68f0b6c05412441c9b944063fcd06; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 6afd8058db5cbbc03341a8df11866b4d5755c038; 686a83bc3f66cbde6d13e0dc3e045a2666ad72d2; b77bad95f937db51c54fe5dfbb688da2d2089e4d; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 42bb0ac384fb87933be67f63b98d90a45d2fe6e9; de12682f3e96c400a0b5262e581734ccf7ef8bb2; c3c576ff98424bea3e1e223cd6f68d4971438bf8; d1a2d203733208deda7427c8e20318334193d9d7; 8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92; c9e3f9e9828c7a078e1d3f8652f12027e988e306; 1fb58b6de34ae18174a111a9f32efaf79bbb0bbe; 16cecb0173adc68762b6e70daecb25089a5a6b6a; 23f3c3cef8cdd5cbdf74cbe60baf7f9eafb6667a; db1c6e0727e1707f6202352c19d684b2eb3101e1; 08451d088401125eb6a1f423d9f79bf8b6c4c404; bc34c28ee40356b4d7bbe7be7d173a2436a89688; 226bab70ecb9e13ef8fdb503a6183615d5c898ed; 52554f8a20edb544ca0cc3c35ed9c1e50536ff6e; 32ef8d891edde06cc01357fa5c4d1ab7fe631720; bf779b9ca68b915a8807ec6e99c084b4d6de549a; 67efb8c1eb6fb2227528db74b79ee40fa8fa4ba4; 77e983b126afb8f2970405b6b2abe612dbcdecd6; 46877bf429540bbbc14444b3047e823cc1b46ae9,bioRxiv,,

To analyze the long-term changes of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness before and after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in patients with severe diabetic retinopathy.


METHODS
In this retrospective observational case series, we reviewed the records of 46 patients (68 eyes) with severe diabetic retinopathy, who were treated with PRP and could be followed for more than 6 months. Peripapillary RNFL thickness and foveal thickness were measured at baseline, 3-month intervals until 1 year post-PRP, and 6- to 12-month intervals after 1 year post-PRP using optical coherence tomography. Long-term changes of peripapillary RNFL thickness and foveal thickness as well as the correlation between the two parameters were analyzed.


RESULTS
The average RNFL thickness (360Â° measurement) decreased significantly from 108.4 Î¼m to 103.5 Î¼m at 2 years post-PRP. The average RNFL thickness increased slightly during the initial 3 months post-PRP and thereafter gradually decreased, showing statistically significant reductions at 2 years post-PRP (false discovery rate adjusted P = 0.0051). The superior and inferior quadrant RNFL thicknesses were significantly decreased at 2 years post-PRP (false discovery rate adjusted P = 0.0119 and 0.0051, respectively). The decrease in the nasal quadrant RNFL thickness showed borderline significance at 2 years post-PRP (false discovery rate adjusted P = 0.0854). However, there was no significant decrease in RNFL thickness for the temporal quadrant at any follow-up time. In addition, there was no significant difference in the foveal thickness. But, the pattern of temporal changes in foveal thickness showed a similar pattern with that of temporal RNFL thickness.


CONCLUSION
This study shows that average RNFL thickness after PRP undergoes early thickening and subsequent progressive thinning throughout the 2 years post-PRP. This temporal change varies according to the peripapillary RNFL quadrant. Our results also indicate that temporal RNFL and foveal thickness have a similar pattern of long-term change after PRP.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jong-Shin Kim"", ids = ""103525938""); list(name = ""Se Joon Woo"", ids = ""1405896225""); list(name = ""Jeeyun Ahn"", ids = ""2885995""); list(name = ""Ki Ho Park"", ids = ""152427506""); list(name = ""Hum Chung"", ids = ""49781790""); list(name = ""Kyu Hyung Park"", ids = ""1400220467"")",332cb7122403b229bb044911b61feff32242b747; 3a758109afa7b3aede75695c9d3cf76d0bb48a26; 3eef197f2b76ae5872b71cc0f9dc1f03cce5324d; 4eb261c8c6fc1fc51af81fba7c9a299ecd351da6; e8465f4c9944d0a0d201182b6d54df0c9f583a29; 1500d45acf9f7858c7d4cbcc0e4ba96e15d68f31; 2048f2774a67c67bc24fdec455e2a55bcded2f92; 443c1392a5fe704701e1ad50f5d60a3638e6d21c; 49deaaafa069f9caf24c689678f1fb30a100feaa; 9ed929403ab6f024f8c6e7c91bb61fc5ed5c0b10; 5407d71f831c5af13a4b05d695d63b8eed337e90; 5a2604aaff5823dc646520ef8efbb2dd93563e81; 6a91b571ed9dab3272b7144b38fdeccaed1181fa; 3009f4082751b7759869de385bc8c68bc9c0f80c; aa79eece10b220bc2387bf20c122f6834b4bea7e; 801b13ab06dbed13b6a8a9f0e3341b022f274750; e7d3519742074edee3be963f31afcf22cf876597; becc607499481b4692d16695de1e4c72b7d24d8c; 7c53f010b066247200f7efb9ebef1fa4a1c0037f; 2d49af2d7015157f5db712e7185b5e35c6039702,47c5cd9f31faf0da2544b53460ac23525e996978; 8d896a6a6441df738b90c3d38eb29615dc17a449; 77de72746967c0abfde944fd1daa37a6fc5ab415; 6f12bde6cd92b20645f89fb1895a3a5d83dde160; 1ea0ba0872e482a04c44b6dcaa8088738a6a457e; 6753909c7e68d9e46900d7884ac1cf580d339ec1; 7c7368b8086f007a8a3927e3e7ac80a946bd3a8d; 20c1f3cb438a6f511a7bb14a533f4b6181fc4295; 0e597e76cd8f0849a6cee2453d6d3b1aa13557c6; 6e8cafc9231f00698116d8611b0be44ec34dc886; 6adf69b36e2041c975e73fc2fcd6b99b8b18471d; 1c87864916318e70792536a29fa517c927e30399; 0cca28d80107aaeafaa0d86f17ded7da5585246f; 6126ea9e8bf57cf117c64091e07fdd5b3bbdbc42; 6b02b58a58abbc4b5fce3f9188b066c80436832c; 735f413ea6626460a0ffcf6bdb8dbd88f2b481b2; 6d465677d5cddb3791a637d62bc5c2d2be184350,Retina,32 10,"

82c794f6109443bb0bc9dff94e1e3aee8ccd646e,Gene Expression Analysis in Human Peripheral Blood Cells after 900 MHz RF-EMF Short-Term Exposure,"Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) are a basic requirement of modern wireless communication technology. Statutory thresholds of RF-EMF are established to limit relevant additional heat supply in human tissue. Nevertheless, to date, questions concerning nonthermal biological effects have yet to be fully addressed. New versions of microarrays (8 Ã— 60K v2) provide a higher resolution of whole genome gene expression to display adaptive processes in cells after irradiation. In this ex vivo/in vitro study, we irradiated peripheral blood cells from five donors with a continuous wave of 900 MHz RF-EMF for 0, 30, 60 and 90 min. Gene expression changes (P â‰¤ 0.05 and â‰¥twofold differences above or below the room temperature control exposed samples) were evaluated with microarray analysis. The results were compared with data from room temperature + 2Â°C samples. Verification of microarray results was performed using bioinformatic analyses and qRT-PCR. We registered a lack of an EMF-specific gene expression response after applying the false discovery rate adjustment (FDR), using a high-stringency approach. Low-stringency analysis revealed 483 statistically significant deregulated transcripts in all RF-EMF groups relative to the room temperature exposed samples without an association with their corresponding room temperature + 2Â°C controls. Nevertheless, these transcripts must be regarded as statistical artefacts due to the absence of a targeted biological response, including enrichment and network analyses administered to microarray expressed gene subset profiles. Correspondingly, 14 most promising candidate transcripts examined by qRT-PCR displayed an absence of correlation with respect to the microarray results. In conclusion, these findings indicate that 900 MHz EMF exposure establishing an average specific absorption rate of 9.3 W/kg to whole blood cells is insufficient to induce nonthermal effects in gene expression during short-time exposure up to 90 min.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andreas Lamkowski"", ids = ""5522617""); list(name = ""Matthias Kreitlow"", ids = ""30633468""); list(name = ""JÃ¶rg Radunz"", ids = ""36195839""); list(name = ""Martin Willenbockel"", ids = ""46985224""); list(name = ""Frank Sabath"", ids = ""1904300""); list(name = ""Winfried Schuhn"", ids = ""36300729""); list(name = ""Marcus Stiemer"", ids = ""1874166""); list(name = ""Lars Ole Fichte"", ids = ""12877878""); list(name = ""Michael Dudzinski"", ids = ""48716870""); list(name = ""Sebastian BÃ¶hmelt"", ids = ""36105974""); list(name = ""Reinhard Ullmann"", ids = ""145398832""); list(name = ""Matthaeus Majewski"", ids = ""40456883""); list(name = ""Valeria Franchini"", ids = ""48878664""); list(name = ""Stefan Eder"", ids = ""143915728""); list(name = ""Alexis Rump"", ids = ""34568183""); list(name = ""Matthias Port"", ids = ""40479881""); list(name = ""Michael Abend"", ids = ""5846418"")",f5a345610c20e6846abfb45d8e781aee5f2cd97b; ead90823a2a2979054ee72500b1570a76e9fe688; e3964827f8724dd56970014400e7f866bf6b60fc,779cce648e87d5d08c0fda0ebdde8a858e2f9d76; 7cd2a50b1c3b6288104221aad5fd75235147d570; 33a0bddd21f35bf3c574006d3ebc691585e8f8f3; 497738c7a71bd4823ed27e90c5fd7c81dd444193; cd39c38d514a87667fbf7c6f2c9ad59436bf8fe5; 97b505f422ffad85a8aac5de4c15e8b6a663d9c6; 1fc45af55582228842ca2de24f5534bd556cc507; 0cd6c59f689c11429b4acf529f5456eec895aa78; 33f1f8451448083585cce78089ef3b404a2f8fa2; 2e78ff39f485c9daaf26dd82f36fb0ccd09e34da; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; aa8d1279c6005210d4d204a74b0ace60fb29fc2c; 86fb9d412336382bd475674b67f2b88be3d77029; 80d6318c5ab77cc79ec150198302ed67acdf8d55; 9a6f57f3d6f18b754103a5b91c01337acab91a4c; 6cf147927d1c82a0e4c040363bceb795c0cc8101; 4c3cc384b079600667fda76585ca28e001a7c046; 64e7648cdc4a4850b6803816446c6b5b2dc20354; 5721e6b1b047875031eee65a44346f744fd4c919; 27d942d4ae218d0f0f8d784f745e5324e067eea5; e1624cfc69296ec928e9c320a782950aa038b4a5; 6ead227d982324c8c7a1cdc3dbec45dfeeac2165; 68fde84190f58d3ed32e5974bb391a261fa6eb75; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 14a25874d0df4e356a5aa299e1aa7fdc26b34f17; f75d3a6c8c8074c830c8aaaf0a162ec9fb14c329; c258d0814ac16455fa48f752c22b3bd4bdce03c1; 32c262e0161728208f6ed6b87278896bfeac763c; 596042d8a12b9bd66da2f25e435642b018f66dc7; 0d0d956f37c24f6f2b50da71525994af3096e65b; 898ffcd2ec42a792f243075d6b11a01a4c9689eb; 2566b2bca41c63e853593e85ff58453ad6833390; 91a0a00a0a5b8272ef677f475737b28ef5e57ae5; cea5b4ce12cc1ae2fb98e96e902592ce5abb3abb; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 3cbb0df23992c6731b8205d81c67cc0a7f40ad37; f25e3f21bf3cd90f1d91816a9544dbeb2fe1af12; 4651b1dd4b0318a65119bce2e7b95b26053216bc; d482c27ed232459d71cd482213a6aec9369de639; 5d35d1d17da0cf7ec6f5a7231bc7b62dfffb6fdf; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 08343b197f3d138c1c1e8b0e17165a5b6ba28c1c; be6b7fb3c8eb7b8610497042ff6de0a5b8d770bb; 845936f1db153c77285efe8124da6da1ab376c0a; cf5189754d658f2511a65b5bb38e31432c0009c0,Radiation Research,189,529 - 540

We conducted a serum metabolomic analysis of 620 men in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (1985-2013). During 28 years of follow-up, there were 435 deaths (197 CVD and 107 cancer). The analysis included 406 known metabolites measured with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We used Cox regression to estimate mortality hazard ratios for a 1-standard-deviation difference in metabolite signals. The strongest associations with overall mortality were N-acetylvaline (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.28; P < 4.1 Ã— 10-5, below Bonferroni statistical threshold) and dimethylglycine, 7-methylguanine, C-glycosyltryptophan, taurocholate, and N-acetyltryptophan (1.23 â‰¤ HR â‰¤ 1.32; 5 Ã— 10-5 â‰¤ P â‰¤ 1 Ã— 10-4). C-Glycosyltryptophan, 7-methylguanine, and 4-androsten-3Î²,17Î²-diol disulfate were statistically significantly associated with CVD mortality (1.49 â‰¤ HR â‰¤ 1.62, P < 4.1 Ã— 10-5). No metabolite was associated with cancer mortality, at a false discovery rate of <0.1. Individuals with a 1-standard-deviation higher metabolite risk score had increased all-cause and CVD mortality in the test set (HR = 1.4, P = 0.05; HR = 1.8, P = 0.003, respectively).

7523d9e48226534297034a5498d5afb5a6b7dcc2,Characterizing Transcriptional and Epigenetic Signatures Induced By FLT3-ITD Activation,"Molecular studies have shown that specific somatic mutations impact therapeutic response and overall outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and have informed the development of molecularly targeted therapies. Previous studies have shown that the FLT3-ITD mutant disease allele predicts a poor prognosis in AML. Despite this important insight and the established role of FLT3-ITD mutations in AML pathogenesis, the impact of this mutation on gene regulation has not been extensively investigated. We hypothesized that transcriptional and epigenetic studies using genetically accurate murine models, cell lines, and primary AML samples would allow us to identify how FLT3 activation induces changes in gene expression and chromatin state.

To assess the impact of FLT3-ITD associated FLT3 activation on gene expression, we performed RNA-sequencing studies on two FLT3-ITD cell lines (MOLM-13 and MV4-11) in the presence/absence of AC-220, a potent, specific FLT3 inhibitor. We also treated mice expressing a constitutive FLT3-ITD knock-in allele with AC-220 or vehicle, and performed RNA-sequencing on purified granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs). We assessed the impact of transient (4-12 hours drug treatment) and chronic (10-14 days) FLT3 inhibition on gene expression; we hypothesized that chronic drug exposure would result in more robust FLT3-mutant gene expression changes. In each case, the effects of FLT3-ITD activation/inhibition on gene expression were compared to RNA-seq data from FLT3-ITD mutant patients from TCGA.

We first investigated the impact of short-term and chronic drug exposure on FLT3-ITD dependent gene expression in vitro . Comparison of short-term drug and vehicle treated cells revealed 159 differentially expressed (DE) genes (Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH FDR) p 0.8). By contrast, we found that chronic FLT3 inhibition identified 743 DE genes. Comparison between the acutely and chronically treated cell lines revealed overlap of only 19 genes, suggesting important differences between the acute and steady-state effects of FLT3-inhibition. We found more significant overlap between chronic FLT3-inhibitor gene expression and FLT3-ITD specific gene expression in TCGA, demonstrating that long-term drug exposure more robustly delineates mutant-specific effects on gene expression.

We next investigated the impact of short and long term FLT3-inhibition on gene expression in vivo . Analysis of DE genes identified 93 genes in the acutely treated mice vs. vehicle, and 274 genes in chronically treated mice (BH FDR p 0.5). Only 12 DE genes were shared between these two perturbations compared with vehicle control. We then compared these gene expression signatures to FLT3-ITD specific gene expression from TCGA; we noted a significant inverse correlation between the signatures of chronic FLT3 inhibition in vivo with FLT3-ITD specific gene expression in TCGA (R2=0.47), but no correlation between the gene expression changes of acute FLT3 inhibition and FLT3-ITD TCGA patients (R2=0.09).

We next integrated the FLT3 signatures from our in vivo work and TCGA with ChIP-sequencing for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in primary samples with FLT3-ITD compared to normal controls. We found that 3.6% of DE genes in our in vivo system, and 7.2% of DE genes in TCGA, had significant changes in H3K4me3 or H3K27me3. The most common alteration in chromatin state observed with FLT3 activation was an increase in H3K4me3 and transcriptional activation, with a smaller set of genes showing increased H3K27me3 and reduced expression, consistent with FLT3-mediated epigenetic repression. Motif analysis showed that DE loci with significant changes in chromatin state were enriched for ELF5, NF-E2, Pu.1, and Bach1 binding sequences, implicating these transcription factors in mediating FLT3-dependent gene expression effects.

By studying the global transcriptional changes that occur with chronic, steady-state FLT3 inhibition in in vitro and in vivo systems, we identified a set of gene expression changes characteristic of FLT3-activation. In addition, integrating changes in gene expression and chromatin state allowed us to identify loci with alterations in epigenetic state in the setting of FLT3-ITD associated FLT3 activation, and to identify candidate transcription factors that mediate FLT3-dependent effects on gene expression.

While several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be associated with risk of MI, they do not fully explain the observed genetic component of MI. We have been investigating the association between MI and SNPs that are located in genes and have the potential to affect gene function or expression. We have previously published studies that tested about 12,000 SNPs for association with risk of MI, early-onset MI, or coronary stenosis. In the current study we tested 17,576 SNPs that could affect gene function or expression. In order to use genotyping resources efficiently, we staged the testing of these SNPs in three case-control studies of MI. In the first study (762 cases, 857 controls) we tested 17,576 SNPs and found 1,949 SNPs that were associated with MI (P<0.05). We tested these 1,949 SNPs in a second study (579 cases and 1159 controls) and found that 24 SNPs were associated with MI (1-sided P<0.05) and had the same risk alleles in the first and second study. Finally, we tested these 24 SNPs in a third study (475 cases and 619 controls) and found that 5 SNPs in 4 genes (ENO1, FXN (2 SNPs), HLA-DPB2, and LPA) were associated with MI in the third study (1-sided P<0.05), and had the same risk alleles in all three studies. The false discovery rate for this group of 5 SNPs was 0.23. Thus, we have identified 5 SNPs that merit further examination for their potential association with MI. One of these SNPs (in LPA), has been previously shown to be associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in other studies.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dov Shiffman"", ids = ""35434922""); list(name = ""John P.

b6148cf4496f1ab216eeddda64958659a186b470,Discovering Conditionally Salient Features with Statistical Guarantees,"The goal of feature selection is to identify important features that are relevant to explain an outcome variable. Most of the work in this domain has focused on identifying globally relevant features, which are features that are related to the outcome using evidence across the entire dataset. We study a more fine-grained statistical problem: conditional feature selection, where a feature may be relevant depending on the values of the other features. For example in genetic association studies, variant $A$ could be associated with the phenotype in the entire dataset, but conditioned on variant $B$ being present it might be independent of the phenotype. In this sense, variant $A$ is globally relevant, but conditioned on $B$ it is no longer locally relevant in that region of the feature space. We present a generalization of the knockoff procedure that performs conditional feature selection while controlling a generalization of the false discovery rate (FDR) to the conditional setting. By exploiting the feature/response model-free framework of the knockoffs, the quality of the statistical FDR guarantee is not degraded even when we perform conditional feature selections. We implement this method and present an algorithm that automatically partitions the feature space such that it enhances the differences between selected sets in different regions, and validate the statistical theoretical results with experiments.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jaime Roquero Gimenez"", ids = ""40524941""); list(name = ""James Y.

9495f754ddd771ee6084361eaf69c1de3ef6c682,Association of genetic variation of the six gene prognostic model for castrationâ€resistant prostate cancer with survival,"BACKGROUND
We previously identified a blood RNA transcript-based model consisting of six immune or inflammatory response genes (ABL2, SEMA4D, ITGAL, C1QA, TIMP1, and CDKN1A) that was prognostic for survival in cohorts of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We investigated whether inherited variation in these six genes was associated with overall survival (OS) in men with CRPC.


METHODS
The test cohort comprised 600 patients diagnosed with CRPC between 1996 and 2011 at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Genotyping of 66 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the six genes was performed on blood derived DNAs. For the top four SNPs (P <â€‰0.05), validation was conducted in an independent cohort of 223 men diagnosed with CRPC between 2000 and 2014. Multivariable Cox regression adjusting for known prognostic factors estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association of genetic variants with OS.


RESULTS
Two thirds of patients in both cohorts had metastases at CRPC diagnosis. Median OS from CRPC diagnosis was 3.6 (95%CI 3.3-4.0) years in the test cohort and 4.6 (95%CI 3.8-5.2) years in the validation cohort. Fifty-nine SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were analyzed. The major alleles of rs1318056 and rs1490311 in ABL2, and the minor alleles of rs2073917 and rs3764322 in ITGAL were associated with increased risk of death in the test cohort (adjusted-HRs 1.27-1.39; adjusted-p <0.05; false discovery rate <0.35). In the validation cohort, a similar association with OS was observed for rs1318056 in ABL2 (adjusted-HR 1.44; 95%CI 0.89-2.34) and rs2073917 in ITGAL (adjusted-HR 1.41; 95%CI 0.82-2.42). The associations did not reach statistical significance most likely due to the small sample size of the validation cohort (adjusted-pâ€‰=â€‰0.142 and 0.209, respectively). Additional eQTL analysis indicated that minor alleles of rs1318056 and rs1490311 in ABL2 are associated with a lower ABL2 expression in blood.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings corroborate our initial work on the RNA expression of genes involved in immunity and inflammation from blood and clinical outcome and suggest that germline polymorphisms in ABL2 and ITGAL may be associated with the risk of death in men with CRPC. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore their functional mechanisms.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wanling Xie"", ids = ""3449026""); list(name = ""Konrad H Stopsack"", ids = ""3852219""); list(name = ""Sarah J.

7c22498a9bb883aa745b5feda303c4f4fac30c52,"Improving collision induced dissociation (CID), high energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fourier transform MS/MS degradome-peptidome identifications using high accuracy mass information.","MS dissociation methods, including collision induced dissociation (CID), high energy collision dissociation (HCD), and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), can each contribute distinct peptidome identifications using conventional peptide identification methods (Shen et al. J. Proteome Res. 2011), but such samples still pose significant informatics challenges. In this work, we explored utilization of high accuracy fragment ion mass measurements, in this case provided by Fourier transform MS/MS, to improve peptidome peptide data set size and consistency relative to conventional descriptive and probabilistic scoring methods. For example, we identified 20-40% more peptides than SEQUEST, Mascot, and MS_GF scoring methods using high accuracy fragment ion information and the same false discovery rate (FDR) from CID, HCD, and ETD spectra. Identified species covered >90% of the collective identifications obtained using various conventional peptide identification methods, which significantly addresses the common issue of different data analysis methods generating different peptide data sets. Choice of peptide dissociation and high-precision measurement-based identification methods presently available for degradomic-peptidomic analyses needs to be based on the coverage and confidence (or specificity) afforded by the method, as well as practical issues (e.g., throughput). By using accurate fragment information, >1000 peptidome components can be identified from a single human blood plasma analysis with low peptide-level FDRs (e.g., 0.6%), providing an improved basis for investigating potential disease-related peptidome components.",2012,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yufeng Shen"", ids = ""37082667""); list(name = ""Nikola ToliÄ‡"", ids = ""2429166""); list(name = ""Samuel Owen Purvine"", ids = ""3036325""); list(name = ""Richard D Smith"", ids = ""145558544"")",5382738137705b6bb159fef39194571937394b88; ea41aae7089ddba365ece306a0b20cee25aeb736; 45b084bfe29b5273013b6ef5fab075c638bfa04a; ab2705480c670bd6c782a18cd04b513862583254; 9392382301b40aa12c22f4aa65e6d4fc78da183a; e29cf25a8b5f38408e90370adab1d6633cbc4a05; 82614dff1c3832ba3d441e92c0cb7eda719a6d11,e282d2b697b6c6b59bae5de710d3824d88a0051d; 50c6e620a45faa87eba292279491bbc8845dd6c8; 81ff926d32790181b63fc48ee2ef29f81d6036f8; e7efccfabb3f21c9836c9be8ba397e547a01b078; 1af472a28bf5ece1e02bdfe8787676f374a4b1c4; 0c986a699e9088db0edb5d8c784c19693a988072; e29f37e0b23e88ddf76886755e337716f47cd839; b5b6aba35d2a0dde138b69c85b31a4ddf6c723c1; fe53f95e2bf6b3030ce8a5ae225f5ac11cdb828b; fb2256fdee038f5300e355b4b42f2e6709aafbc4; 7ced2f36ad15bcb0958cf35a704593b899d896a0; 2c7c4b339d721e25e250380473ebfe48933916a9; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 38b11f248adc01a302fb1bacdbd407e1ca74811c; 0f7a2bfc59cef7a1a822144a6fadf00ce04233a2; 7a0363da997fccdb09f23e53a1618a9033bc9a81; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 2c426d9c2da06c9b37c4ee4fe493d8c7aa612d50; cb84bccc93b19f5b90cfe8e719fe67e4db0c5149,Journal of proteome research,11 2,"

Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa (BN) and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg], twin-based=0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge-eating, AN without binge-eating, and a BN factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Total sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2,400 to ~537,000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (rg=0.18; false discovery rate q=0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg=0.23; q<0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge-eating (rg=0.27; q=0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed between three non-diagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge-eating (rgs=-0.19 to âˆ’0.23; qs<0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer significant after co-varying for MDD loci.

e17fc77048fc09190630f8771f66c32bf816b34d,Proteogenomics: Opportunities and Caveats.,"Proteogenomics is a rapidly evolving field at the intersection of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Whole genome, exome, and RNA sequencing are well-established techniques that can provide information at the DNA and RNA level with excellent sequencing coverage and depth. Although tens of thousands of clinical samples have been sequenced thus far, data integration and interpretation still remain largely incomplete. Recent advances in proteomic technologies have enabled the accurate and almost complete characterization of the proteomes of many tissues and biological fluids. Integration of multiomics data for the accurate annotation and reciprocal refinement of genomic and proteomic models is essentially the goal of proteogenomics.

This integrative approach has the potential to provide solid evidence for the translation of previously unknown transcripts. Those transcripts and the respective encoded proteins might be implicated in physiological or pathophysiological processes. Novel reported peptides can represent single amino acid variants, splice variants, gene fusions, RNA editing events, novel open reading frames, translated noncoding RNAs, and pseudogenes, among many others. Proteogenomic platforms can now be used to investigate which of these novel â€œeventsâ€ gets translated at the protein level, thereby implicating them as candidate new druggable targets or as new diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for a wide spectrum of diseases.

The potential for such identifications is maximized when both sequencing and raw proteomic data originate from the very same sample under investigation. It is becoming clear that this â€œsample-specificâ€ approach, and the use of matched customized search databases, is associated with lower false-positive and false-negative identification rates. However, like all areas of active research, proteogenomics in its current state is not free of drawbacks. Major limitations in the field are the sensitivity of the mass spectrometers, the increased false discovery rate for the novel peptide hits, and the inherent biophysical properties that render some peptides undetectable.

In many solid cancers, early detection leads to decreased morbidity and improved survival suggesting that a similar approach may benefit AML patients. Recently, we showed that the initial genomic events that drive AML can be detected years before diagnosis and that individuals at increased risk share distinct features that differentiate them from those with benign age related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). However, the relative high incidence of ARCH and the low incidence of AML, along with the fact that ARCH is recurrently being driven by mutations that occur in genes associated with AML, impedes complete discrimination. High sequencing costs for the relative large number of mutated genes implicated with the disease further hinders clinical adaptation. Therefore, a better strategic approach that is focussed on the most informative mutations and the development of accurate tools for data mining would better estimate the risk for AML development and create applicable and cost-efficient screens for early detection of AML. Methods We hypothesize that the majority of the power to accurately predict the development of AML can be derived by a minimal number of pre-leukemic hotspot mutations (pLHM) and that improved accuracy of mutation calling algorithms will increase the discrimination between high and low risk cases. We developed a novel approach to differentiate technical errors from true mutations by accounting for local sequence features to derive contextual error signatures. We demonstrate that Error Correction by Signatures Integration (ECSI) detects mutations at a higher sensitivity and specificity when compared to other techniques. 320 blood samples taken years before AML diagnosis and 856 controls were interrogated for the presence of pLHM. This data was used to construct an AML prediction model that was tuned to achieve 100% positive predictive value. To estimate the frequency of individuals at the highest risk for AML development in the general population, we applied the model to a total of 42,838 individuals whose blood was sequenced in four independent ARCH studies. Results ECSI revealed that some pLHM lie within signatures with particularly high error rates. For example, DNMT3A-R882H is defined by the signature G[C>T]G that has the highest sequencing error rate of all. Our analysis suggests that this mutation and others might be over reported when error signatures are not being considered. As compared with other mutation calling techniques, our analysis unbiasedly increased the discrimination between cases and controls by accurately indicating the presence of mutations in pre-AML cases and flagging others that are not significantly above their corresponding signature9s error-rate in the controls. We show that a highly specific AML prediction model can be generated by targeting a small number of genomic loci corresponding to changes in only 46 amino-acids previously reported to define AML with poor outcome. Testing our model on the four ARCH datasets pointed to 103 individuals who are at the highest risk for AML development. At least 6 could have been confirmed to developed hematological cancer after sampling. Conclusions The development of a technically simple tool for data mining that is reliable and has a rapid turnaround is a critical step for clinical adaptation of sequencing-based screens for early cancer detection. We present a novel mutation calling method that fulfills such criteria and provides an improved analytical sensitivity and specificity. We found that a minimal group of pLHM carries most of the information needed to accurately predict AML development. Focusing on such a small yet an informative number of mutations provides a 9two birds, one stone9 strategic approach that enables better discrimination between pre-AML and benign ARCH at reduced costs. Implementing a highly effective and affordable genomic assay is an important step enabling a wider population screen to identify the portion of individuals at the highest risk for pre-malignant cell transformation with minimal false discovery rate. Populations targeted by our prediction model should be prioritized for frequent follow-up, clinical studies and further research to elucidate additional risk-parameters.

We identified which PM2.5 species had association with DNAmPhenoAccel in a one-year exposure window in a longitudinal cohort. We collected whole blood samples from 683 elderly men in the Normative Aging Study between 1999 and 2013 (nÂ =Â 1254 visits). DNAm PhenoAge was calculated using 513 CpGs retrieved from the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Daily concentrations of PM2.5 species were measured at a fixed air-quality monitoring site and one-year moving averages were computed. Linear mixed-effect (LME) regression and Bayesian kernel machine (BKM) regression were used to estimate the associations. The covariates included chronological age, body mass index (BMI), cigarette pack years, smoking status, estimated cell types, batch effects etc. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate at a 5% false positive threshold was used to adjust for multiple comparison. During the study period, the mean DNAm PhenoAge and chronological age in our subjects were 68 and 73 years old, respectively. Using LME model, only lead and calcium were significantly associated with DNAmPhenoAccel. For example, an interquartile range (IQR, 0.0011Â Î¼g/m3) increase in lead was associated with a 1.29-year [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47, 2.11] increase in DNAmPhenoAccel. Using BKM model, we selected PM2.5, lead, and silicon to be predictors for DNAmPhenoAccel. A subsequent LME model showed that only lead had significant effect on DNAmPhenoAccel: 1.45-year (95% CI: 0.46, 2.46) increase in DNAmPhenoAccel following an IQR increase in one-year lead. This is the first study that investigates long-term effects of PM2.5 components on DNAmPhenoAccel. The results demonstrate that lead and calcium contained in PM2.5 was robustly associated with DNAmPhenoAccel.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cuicui Wang"", ids = ""87801491""); list(name = ""Petros Koutrakis"", ids = ""5014576""); list(name = ""X-H Gao"", ids = ""49779648""); list(name = ""Andrea A.

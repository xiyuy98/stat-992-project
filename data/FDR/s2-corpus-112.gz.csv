a0bb59283d70e0a53116cd3475130e0a4895ee3e,Improved strategies for rapid identification of chemically cross-linked peptides using protein interaction reporter technology.,"Protein interaction reporter (PIR) technology can enable identification of in vivo protein interactions with the use of specialized chemical cross-linkers, liquid chromatography, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. PIR-cross-linkers contain labile bonds that are specifically fragmented under low energy collision or photodissociation conditions in the mass spectrometer source, thus releasing cross-linked peptides. Successful analysis of PIR-cross-linked proteins requires the use of expected mathematical relationships between cross-linked complexes and released peptides after fragmentation of the labile PIR bonds. Presented here is a next-generation software tool, BLinks, for use in the analysis and identification of PIR-cross-linked proteins. BLinks is an advancement beyond our previous efforts by incorporation of chromatographic profiles that must match between cross-linked complexes and released peptides to enable estimation of p-values to help filter true relationships from complex data sets. Additionally, BLinks was used to incorporate Mascot database searching results from subsequent MS/MS analysis of the released peptides to facilitate identification of cross-linked proteins. BLinks was used in the analysis of human serum albumin, and 46 interpeptide relationships were found spanning 30 proximal residues with a 2.2% false discovery rate. BLinks was also used to track peptides involved in multiple, coeluting relationships that make accurate identification of protein interactions difficult. An additional 10 interpeptide relationships were identified despite poor correlation using the profiling tools provided with BLinks. Additionally, BLinks can be used to globally map all interpeptide relationships from the data analysis and customize subsequent analysis to target specific peptides of interest, thus making it a useful tool for both discovery of protein interactions and mapping protein topology.",2010,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Michael R.

Microarray technology emerges as a powerful tool in life science. One major application of microarray technology is to identify differentially expressed genes under various conditions. Currently, the statistical methods to analyze microarray data are generally unsatisfactory, mainly due to the lack of understanding of the distribution and error structure of microarray data.


RESULTS
We develop a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test based on the two-component model proposed by Rocke and Durbin to identify differentially expressed genes from microarray data. Simulation studies show that the GLR test is more powerful than commonly used methods, like the fold-change method and the two-sample t-test. When applied to microarray data, the GLR test identifies more differentially expressed genes than the t-test, has a lower false discovery rate and shows more consistency over independently repeated experiments.

0af05a7f3bca5533ff8a1e39a2ddabdb5e666415,Comparative gene expression profiles between heterotic and non-heterotic hybrids of tetraploid Medicago sativa,"BackgroundHeterosis, the superior performance of hybrids relative to parents, has clear agricultural value, but its genetic control is unknown. Our objective was to test the hypotheses that hybrids expressing heterosis for biomass yield would show more gene expression levels that were different from midparental values and outside the range of parental values than hybrids that do not exhibit heterosis.ResultsWe tested these hypotheses in three Medicago sativa (alfalfa) genotypes and their three hybrids, two of which expressed heterosis for biomass yield and a third that did not, using Affymetrix M. truncatula GeneChip arrays. Alfalfa hybridized to approximately 47% of the M. truncatula probe sets. Probe set signal intensities were analyzed using MicroArray Suite v.5.0 (MAS) and robust multi-array average (RMA) algorithms. Based on MAS analysis, the two heterotic hybrids performed similarly, with about 27% of genes showing differential expression among the parents and their hybrid compared to 12.5% for the non-heterotic hybrid. At a false discovery rate of 0.15, 4.7% of differentially expressed genes in hybrids (~300 genes) showed nonadditive expression compared to only 0.5% (16 genes) in the non-heterotic hybrid. Of the nonadditively expressed genes, approximately 50% showed expression levels that fell outside the parental range in heterotic hybrids, but only one of 16 showed a similar profile in the non-heterotic hybrid. Genes whose expression differed in the parents were three times more likely to show nonadditive expression than genes whose parental transcript levels were equal.ConclusionThe higher proportions of probe sets with expression level that differed from the parental midparent value and that were more extreme than either parental value in the heterotic hybrids compared to a non-heterotic hybrid were also found using RMA. We conclude that nonadditive expression of transcript levels may contribute to heterosis for biomass yield in alfalfa.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xuehui Li"", ids = ""50079570""); list(name = ""Yanling Wei"", ids = ""47508537""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""48443856""); list(name = ""E Charles Brummer"", ids = ""40254978"")",75a7ccc55dec47a851803d57f3aba4356d0594bb; 83c4ba3261d8319ea347e870408f9ac1c027935a; 4b262d9be103057112ee053a7bdc10a19ca239bf; 46c2cbb483821abfea46cb8691f43da034bdbbf2; 1e38e682c7773a94b6d505de98f5d52ded2c438b; 2e0611d0af5e786e9fb605d701ba60d4009af5b0; 8de10e33bbf348ef7e7084133db0c0b8baa96029; 23c2d9d3581576f050ef4a16e894874c9d747f24; 23a975971e257b08e8dfd5cf10cb3c9f6b9a095a; a5284db33183ea042b3683c4d961bcfc70b84b80; a047777ff376d50bf86e80d88c29edb72c74a2a1; ae53a249c24a6a8f89a1f00b80ad6fae865b85f2; 0aed622a459c380a3460a8cb8f4ebefca39c25ed; a95eb67a69522ca122a227ff40a3291a51a3f2c8; b292ceed2a900f62f7333738b5a4c6093b62645f; 8407ae413ee61de43ef2c9885a394e0a4533c54b; f02a8bc53d02b0c39fffe28e4982c641f4e3d719; d1270bd742834e64b60160cd63bd16bdce7672ab; f6e1b169b111328ade1137b6ae01e098fb57c761; 143d6836acf1107084eb749ff10ed46a3a8968cc; b5d59a30be3faa5e46e84917cd090e79f32929c0; 482c5dd9c4f6f9341d18da6e15f29ed5d294ab6a; a8576ec1795a04fdc31223895d21c9c251ce27a6; d1db0b8df38d5b7a562be6d2854e905db6c2dd59,9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; 59f3d3f8ed2674ba5e3aaa604afc2186c1adf909; 6c0c88dd4d77191452d556440d9ff7f51a781ec6; 1bb0c98f5466e4005089e4aa5fa81f667a8c9f21; 0b855a0ee554f6e2f7fab289b9fc912b0280db69; ef60c13f046019c6dd779fd26fb2bbc6162d1361; 539234523b375b77aa47703932d02653a6befa60; dfee8a24832cda259cded3b113a9db36a1d301b8; 7ecd5013ad95edd7e7901e4c914f6d2251aa88b4; 89ad34874da7bfc64db894a6cf665c14f9310e33; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 337871b4e295b6a1f8145b58b715a68624d0ae73; e26b2804e4d12e0391893c496d46fdbd832dd1a2; d226d45102a62f56ef8fb429d913bb3874ffaa6e; 810aa1d4d2ab37256434206d4015485355d4d6b5; 95cdf3e31f3b64a59a577fe3220f1b0c4a3ad063; 0d1312249e88c1ebec5c7f01425d3841e6ed7328; 1d54cfa275be02739f3a4bcf25acae98071150b7; 9831fb0741ea5de4fc857412d5bcf6a88d49491e; 8db4482df07c659525cc8e912b44d3f9105c05d7; 7772a2c4227577c244009f25e950c1d1f2504060; 9ffc09c930186e42bce28929b58359783b1a98fa; 83693dead72604724084943783136c091b0b77d2; 0b6f1421ff2ce6da1a5dc418ba8d77c6c118eea6; 89578eac44d57985592207a4cb34a519fc01b7f6; d380907cec1fa5250582d8a59273909842dc22f8; 68053d2411e0042b4024ef16bf3e2ce2a81ff1bd; 39a415b648965654aafafed2a8ba925fe3ff781d; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; c5ea43ed57dc0021f7da4486814163f2f1661d29; 178b9d5d2ea44fa12e27ba0675653e526d8fabee; 77d21f9af8ee701d41b3807a1a82016351f725f5; 49ce3d7cd4a47da244c68851e0611e098818ff82,BMC Plant Biology,9,107 - 107
f0b58048173fbab743c507c7c226cd1c728fd4c9,Shared genetic variants suggest common pathways in allergy and autoimmune diseases,"Background The relationship between allergy and autoimmune disorders is complex and poorly understood. Objective We sought to investigate commonalities in genetic loci and pathways between allergy and autoimmune diseases to elucidate shared disease mechanisms. Methods We metaâ€analyzed 2 genomeâ€wide association studies on selfâ€reported allergy and sensitization comprising a total of 62,330 subjects. These results were used to calculate enrichment for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we probed for enrichment within genetic pathways and of transcription factor binding sites and characterized commonalities in variant burden on tissueâ€specific regulatory sites by calculating the enrichment of allergy SNPs falling in gene regulatory regions in various cells using Encode Roadmap DNaseâ€hypersensitive site data. Finally, we compared the allergy data with those of all known diseases. Results Among 290 loci previously associated with 16 autoimmune diseases, we found a significant enrichment of loci also associated with allergy (P = 1.4eâ€17) encompassing 29 loci at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. Such enrichment seemed to be a general characteristic for autoimmune diseases. Among the common loci, 48% had the same direction of effect for allergy and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of allergy SNPs falling within immune pathways and regions of chromatin accessible in immune cells that was also represented in patients with autoimmune diseases but not those with other diseases. Conclusion We identified shared susceptibility loci and commonalities in pathways between allergy and autoimmune diseases, suggesting shared disease mechanisms. Further studies of these shared genetic mechanisms might help in understanding the complex relationship between these diseases, including the parallel increase in disease prevalence.

a176b8f1db79a1bc27f93698583a378cefc3f168,Automatic Detection and Classification of High-Frequency Oscillations in Depth-EEG Signals,"Goal: Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs [30â€“600Â Hz]) have proven to be relevant biomarkers in epilepsy. In this paper, four categories of HFOs are considered: Gamma ([30â€“80Â Hz]), high-gamma ([80â€“120Â Hz]), ripples ([120â€“250Â Hz]), and fast-ripples ([250â€“600Â Hz]). A universal detector of the four types of HFOs is proposed. It has the advantages of 1) classifying HFOs, and thus, being robust to inter and intrasubject variability; 2) rejecting artefacts, thus being specific. Methods : Gabor atoms are tuned to cover the physiological bands. Gabor transform is then used to detect HFOs in intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. To extract relevant features, energy ratios, along with event duration, are investigated. Discriminant ratios are optimized so as to maximize among the four types of HFOs and artefacts. A multiclass support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify detected events. Pseudoreal signals are simulated to measure the performance of the method when the ground truth is known. Results: Experiments are conducted on simulated and on human iEEG signals. The proposed method shows high performance in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate. Conclusion: The methods have the advantages of detecting and discriminating all types of HFOs as well as avoiding false detections caused by artefacts. Significance: Experimental results show the feasibility of a robust and universal detector.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nisrine Jrad"", ids = ""46895350""); list(name = ""Amar Kachenoura"", ids = ""2856398""); list(name = ""Isabelle Merlet"", ids = ""47387261""); list(name = ""Fabrice Bartolomei"", ids = ""2803281""); list(name = ""Anca Nica"", ids = ""1839052""); list(name = ""Arnaud Biraben"", ids = ""2447256""); list(name = ""Fabrice Wendling"", ids = ""7992816"")",9f8290b9b338f46d7f6882bd8b0e7c268adf94f0; 3d2b6404434966e65b9e85434209df28a261e798; 7eebe5c0694cff2cdd2e7eb0da0104cd41e1e7cd; 6c0bd8a51d7ab37d78e8a79700dcc15dd0c2fee6,19b02990c1bb464200d633cc64f8c76e45b313d7; a1af310962e48b2da8e74d63979e9eec92cf5bd1; b02d8d02f87662bdf37994f678ffd3a8f5023c20; ca2e239c956d4d4e16ee2ebaa05e613b30a84bfc; defa3681eda1d8da580b9d683392cf34a83a108c; 0f80518127dc9c5714ae4fce72586472b3bbbaf1; 06c1f90f3a00911737b4d11df06b8f7667a271b8; a31b7f3b375e105f5192fd1c1e80fe27d7332926; f508d32959a3d67d0bb7ed61be893111cd91c3ba; b09e0dc4323f323bfa0f86ffe4f98d30e82664df; 8ab979b9fcb6b4ea1f0e8f5658d20fb59221bfda; e0963717ecdf534d0b836bb94006cb6cba6eeb55; eb6cd1871e2c9a516d73a19e9c20262074874332; 95a58c98ac71be82d871a48028c9dda0f0eda644; 37dc8456173db32fa3c432362ede60208229405f; 55804c7768733fd33f37db3327a85c51811de88d; 6cbb00c8acd5a5c56258c6e2f98a6cff8227cd4d; 61932351d7870d15761da5101b850ceaac52ef9c; 026caaf8d4fc880adbb2280c4fffb0ba57629daa; 1bd1faee677fcad21889ea3c1eaf4691f22fbe47; 09b3c396d9a5b59057c7514ad41afbbfac9c7444; 46b7a37d9e88f0150ff7d64c7ba9e4b738930c5c; a8ef7e8990527f01847845da9953896f35e489d5; aeecb784a5842f61c14a45007e880e391bbdd45a; e34e07c13b33cdea5766b6cdb119fc691d6e469a; cf417221b16360811ea635cf17fb09db6efe7234; 01415b95567eb66993dca0baf507c1d7bdadfca6; 65fdb549c41cddb3161bc496e056b20088b3d06f; 79319abb7fa481ea75babfd7183e9ec6949cacb5; 1ca93592bb692f5aa46aa00c1062c470d7563ed9; f9f7f4a3dfeeaf0bf99237f1eae185d91d11e175; d6942f07dfb85609e503887448a01f85362d5e86,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,64,2230-2240

We used Red Junglefowl, ancestors of all domesticated chickens selected for either high or low fear of humans for five generations to study the effects of selection on gene transcription in the cerebral hemisphere, which is heavily involved in behaviour control. A total of 24 individuals from the parental generation as well as from the fifth selected generation were used. Twenty-two genes were significantly differentially expressed at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Those genes that were upregulated in the low fearful animals were found to be involved in neural functions. Gene ontology and pathway analysis revealed enrichment for terms associated with behavioural processes. We conclude that five generations of divergent selection for high or low tameness has significantly changed gene expression patterns in the cerebral hemisphere in the Red Junglefowl population used here, which could underlie a range of changes in the domestic phenotype.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Johan BÃ©lteky"", ids = ""4438383""); list(name = ""Beatrix Agnvall"", ids = ""3932238""); list(name = ""Per Jensen"", ids = ""48540818"")",4f91de0eb1d97ad5927821db3138eb8bc36a0079; e5a84f4f0dbf6a5235ba7b9feda5dcde2977345e; 6f996251ddbc55781fde36cd65f8b75a5c864e31; 703ea0de89692368978c4ca90c68e3f49655f87a; 0f90be2d19b5c421e818fe2aa89e089f9f485e08; bf75cb596d5a847a0c92e86b38bac7dbe0ad13ef; 43f751ae268940641806bcae1d8eca6aeab12ceb,827d7e7a8bf8007b77c1e6d092c7f39ac0949e7e; a49a9040dc60d7e195399f8482745c0f58588013; ced23751bb6e21352556da0bbcfddcfd6fe19f18; d53f0da47274cfefeab30d58941d7cec68a2b3c2; b2c6d877caff0ee38bafcdf003b8a7c758e1d45c; e89106d3f4bde8ed6f3c1ec0e918ddeaefff078b; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; b369322e09d67961cbe163a3bf4a8caa2049fb2d; f09b17dbd75a399809ff1ba35ab1c9f8be69424a; cad6fdd064af00410d2783d196de94e86ae9a6a6; b31113ff4597e75f6fe14bc197cf6719a68b72e7; 4401b33b2f469e81f0181fabe8f28543156c9c2c; e64491b7a2c62128224e6fe4e68083939cf10398; 957fed4fe44b005a8cce18ec76736bee2d436432; 0a3e562e78800dbf6164370b54a28629ada46fc4; 7fcbbd56336dfddb3bd970594b82147642f79ec2; c42c1891cd7e0283f7c5f061e50bb85c7dc2aa6e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c0ddc972ae95764639350f272c45cbc5f9fb77d2; b79eec34692155f44f06cdcd4c1ab1ec3a8bf837; 78ea3186b71c5cc3d9abfe150d1a56d245ed5d0a; 2d0d980fd7e15ce884f67226d9b4c3d62400cef4; 716574612ddf4e44fa4628d15164a07812c8dfc0; d912808556f76a9d73d81387451fe0dd73587328; 3a87c801b6409b8e1e463159855d1639e7ec5a31; 8c2a940fa7c16ef0edd83cf906ae6fa2fa5b80d1; 6849e8b0ae49ddc44e7fd8581c27f93dd788e81f; eadeba662b19709c0445ada93b69f0606eaa0628; 7e1b288f5d455122c8d4dd9d02ba7a516803ad33; 5372969547d3e5a865857cd924c591c13ba91a29; a2d44cfce64bd8d9af31f1a82a9c268a6f39ffb4; 975edc74bd52e021eb31ca7d7d1ae29c8e14621b; 64454949af7c6d8a3a20d0da0875145a059dd809; 3a4341ede1461ddc90c2561ebc051363cd7e6574; f8e9283987a0d05635b5e67f21beedfc0113d93e; 90e8ce15cbf6c5714ea4eb09c3d9d32f2c226745; 487517a0478cd725a02f9b198b856a011facffa1; 2633ae47e9f45f1ddd9933231cdaacd1d1d442a7; 3b14bd26733e6f369a67907252f93fd67dd4912f; 20a3cd51af6b0aa637c90e73db3856ebf298f948; 26b13760cbba2c42ed3e86bab5739e04cfbe6a91; e3271609bd0814e337af0e5693f4471c5a392c5b; e6f11db332a3fea2da7c8deef52bf3a243d409e6,PLoS ONE,12,
cc82a7b7c1f2433cd6cb5a5f6e6ce9b3d7e0020b,Large-Scale Candidate Gene Analysis of HDL Particle Features,"BACKGROUND
HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) is an established marker of cardiovascular risk with significant genetic determination. However, HDL particles are not homogenous, and refined HDL phenotyping may improve insight into regulation of HDL metabolism. We therefore assessed HDL particles by NMR spectroscopy and conducted a large-scale candidate gene association analysis.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We measured plasma HDL-C and determined mean HDL particle size and particle number by NMR spectroscopy in 2024 individuals from 512 British Caucasian families. Genotypes were 49,094 SNPs in >2,100 cardiometabolic candidate genes/loci as represented on the HumanCVD BeadChip version 2. False discovery rates (FDR) were calculated to account for multiple testing. Analyses on classical HDL-C revealed significant associations (FDR<0.05) only for CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein; lead SNP rs3764261: p = 5.6*10(-15)) and SGCD (sarcoglycan delta; rs6877118: p = 8.6*10(-6)). In contrast, analysis with HDL mean particle size yielded additional associations in LIPC (hepatic lipase; rs261332: p = 6.1*10(-9)), PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein, rs4810479: p = 1.7*10(-8)) and FBLN5 (fibulin-5; rs2246416: p = 6.2*10(-6)). The associations of SGCD and Fibulin-5 with HDL particle size could not be replicated in PROCARDIS (n = 3,078) and/or the Women's Genome Health Study (n = 23,170).


CONCLUSIONS
We show that refined HDL phenotyping by NMR spectroscopy can detect known genes of HDL metabolism better than analyses on HDL-C.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bernhard M Kaess"", ids = ""6355790""); list(name = ""Maciej Tomaszewski"", ids = ""3643566""); list(name = ""Peter S.

We show that current enhancerâ€“promoter inference methods produce a high rate of false positive links. We introduce FOCS, a new inference method, and by benchmarking against ChIA-PET, HiChIP, and eQTL data show that it results in lower false discovery rates and at the same time higher inference power. By applying FOCS to 2630 samples taken from ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, FANTOM5, and a new compendium of GRO-seq samples, we provide extensive enhancerâ€“promotor maps (http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/focs).

78abddbe33de3cc064dfa747f0c3958ce0766919,Prediction of drift time in ion mobility-mass spectrometry based on Peptide molecular weight.,"A computational model is introduced for predicting peptide drift time in ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IMMS). Each peptide was represented using a numeric descriptor: molecular weight. A simple linear regression predictor was constructed for peptides drift time prediction. Three datasets with different charge state assignments were used for the model training and testing. The dataset one contains 212 singly charged peptides, dataset two has 306 doubly charged peptides, and dataset three contains 77 triply charged peptides. Our proposed method achieved a prediction accuracy of 86.3%, 72.6%, and 59.7% for the dataset one, two and three, respectively. Peptide drift time prediction in IMMS will improve the confidence of peptide identifications by limiting the peptide search space during MS/MS database searching and therefore, reducing false discovery rate (FDR) of protein identification.",2010,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bing Wang"", ids = ""144461642""); list(name = ""Steve Valentine"", ids = ""47942474""); list(name = ""Manolo Plasencia"", ids = ""144953874""); list(name = ""Xiang Zhang"", ids = ""47958479"")",ef4d18852643feb8f487c6365bea28eb1be62c6b,,Protein and peptide letters,17 9,"

08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236,A Bayesian mixture model for differential gene expression,"We propose model-based inference for differential gene expression, using a nonparametric Bayesian probability model for the distribution of gene intensities under various conditions. The probability model is a mixture of normal distributions. The resulting inference is similar to a popular empirical Bayes approach that is used for the same inference problem. The use of fully model-based inference mitigates some of the necessary limitations of the empirical Bayes method. We argue that inference is no more difficult than posterior simulation in traditional nonparametric mixture-of-normal models. The approach proposed is motivated by a microarray experiment that was carried out to identify genes that are differentially expressed between normal tissue and colon cancer tissue samples. Additionally, we carried out a small simulation study to verify the methods proposed. In the motivating case-studies we show how the nonparametric Bayes approach facilitates the evaluation of posterior expected false discovery rates. We also show how inference can proceed even in the absence of a null sample of known non-differentially expressed scores. This highlights the difference from alternative empirical Bayes approaches that are based on plug-in estimates.

512efc7654bc220dece4ec56167171b995674bc0,A Multiplatform Approach for the Discovery of Novel Drug-Induced Kidney Injury Biomarkers.,"Drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI) is a common toxicity observed in pharmaceutical development. We demonstrated the use of label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and multiplex liquid chromatography-single reaction monitoring (LC-SRM) as practical extensions of standard immunoassay based safety biomarker assessments for identification of new toxicity marker candidates and for improved mechanistic understanding. Two different anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum, CDDP), were chosen as the toxicants due to their different modes of nephrotoxicity. Analyses of urine samples from toxicant treated and untreated rats were compared to identify biochemical analytes that changed in response to toxicant exposure. A discovery (label-free LC-MS) and targeted proteomics (multiplex LC-SRM) approach was used in combination with well established immunoassay experiments for the identification of a panel of urinary protein markers related to drug induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The initial generation of an expanded set of markers was accomplished using the label-free LC-MS discovery screen and ELISA based analysis of six nephrotoxicity biomarker proteins. Diagnostic performance of the expanded analyte set was statistically compared to conventional nephrotoxicity biomarkers. False discovery rate (FDR) analysis revealed 18 and 28 proteins from the CDDP and DOX groups, respectively, exhibiting significant differences between the vehicle and treated groups. Multiplex SRM assays were constructed to more precisely quantify candidate markers selected from the discovery screen and immunoassay experiments. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity for each of the candidate biomarkers, histopathology severity scores were used as a benchmark for renal injury followed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on selected biomarkers. Further examination of the best performing analytes revealed relevant biological significance after consideration of anatomical localization and functional roles. In summary, the inclusion of mass spectrometry together with conventional ELISA based assays resulted in the identification of an expanded set of biomarkers with a realistic potential for providing additional beneficial information in mechanistic investigations of drug induced kidney injury and with similar responsiveness to conventionally applied indicators of renal injury.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Liuxi Chen"", ids = ""47818072""); list(name = ""James Smith"", ids = ""143805552""); list(name = ""Jaromir Mikl"", ids = ""47504052""); list(name = ""Ryan M.

4654913bdfa82dc54bf5515c10909365c20aef71,Profiling and Bioinformatics Analyses Reveal Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cells Share a Unique Circular RNA Expression Pattern.,"Approximately 10% of the human transcriptome is composed of circular RNA (circRNAs). These are non-coding RNA molecules in which a covalent bond between the 3' and 5' forms a stable circular loop. Herein, we profiled the expression of 13,368 cricRNAS in 21 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Regardless of clinical, genetics or prognostic characteristics, CLL cells share a unique expression profile that is distinguished from that of normal B cells. Specifically, 859 circRNAs from 592 genes were differentially expressed (fold-change â‰¥2 and false discovery rate â‰¤0.05). Whether dysregulation of circRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL remains to be determined.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Oshrat Raz"", ids = ""4066272""); list(name = ""Galit Granot"", ids = ""1855636""); list(name = ""Metsada Pasmanik-Chor"", ids = ""1398443284""); list(name = ""Pia Raanani"", ids = ""4433212""); list(name = ""Uri Rozovski"", ids = ""5006128"")",,,Experimental hematology,,
99ed676814188f991eca0b67d8962257d810964c,Association Mapping of Hagberg Falling Number in Hard White Spring Wheat,"Hagberg falling number (FN) is an important quality trait used for grain grading. The FN test can only be measured in the late stages of variety development when progeny are homogeneous and sufficient grain is available for testing. The FN is strongly influenced by environmental conditions during reproductive growth stages, including excess moisture, extreme temperature, and biotic and abiotic stresses. The objective of this study was to identify potential genomic regions that influence FN in a subset of 110 hard white spring (HWS) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accessions from the National Small Grain Collection (NSGC) using genomewide association mapping. The FN tests were conducted using grain flour samples of these accessions grown in five environments. A total of 1740 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to detect SNPâ€“FN associations using both the general linear model (GLM) and the mixed linear model (MLM). Thirteen quantitative trait loci (QTL) located in nine chromosomal regions were identified in both GLM and MLM approaches. Pyramiding these QTL could explain up to 45% of the phenotypic variation of FN. The present study identified several potential markers for use in marker-assisted selection for high FN lines in wheat breeding. J.

9305c866a7b202f22638a6fc3731c833c7354def,P 105 Spatio-temporal characteristics of somatosensory-evoked high-gamma activity of the EEG,"Introduction There is enlarging interest in the cortical function of high gamma band (HGB) changes related to different sensory modalities, movement tasks, and higher cognitive processes. EEG experiments have shown visually-evoked, auditory-evoked, and movement-related HGB changes, including the range of 50â€“70Â Hz ( Tallon-Baudry et al., 1997 , Ball et al., 2008 ). While HGB activity in this frequency range associated to peripheral somatosensory stimulation was reported for intracranial recordings in neurological patients ( Fukuda et al., 2008 ), it has received little attention in EEG studies. Here the focus was on very high frequency somatosensory responses above 600Â Hz ( Curio et al., 1994 ). In the present study, we implemented an experimental setup, optimized to measure high frequencies in the EEG, to investigate if robust 50â€“70Â Hz HGB activity in noninvasive EEG could be identified during median nerve SEP stimulation and what the spatio-temporal characteristics of these changes are. Methods In an electromagnetically-shielded cabin, EEG data of 15 healthy subjects was obtained with 128 Ag/AgCl scalp electrodes and with NeurOne amplifiers (24-bit digital resolution and 5Â kHz sampling rate). 1200 SEPs per subject were evoked by stimulation of the left median nerve with a SEP-stimulator. Simultaneous eye-tracking data from 7 of these subjects was attained to examine the influence of ocular movements on the neuronal recordings.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. The current study uses single-marker and gene-based analyses to examine the association between RAAS genes and longitudinal BP phenotypes in a Han Chinese population.


METHODS
A total of 1,768 participants from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity (GenSalt) follow-up study were included in the current study. Twenty-seven BP measurements were taken using random-zero sphygmomanometers at baseline and 2 follow-up visits. Mixed-effect models were used to assess the additive associations of 106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 RAAS genes with longitudinal BP changes and hypertension incidence. Gene-based analyses were conducted using the truncated product method. Attempts were made to replicate significant findings among Asian participants of the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). False discovery rate procedures were used to adjust for multiple testing.


RESULTS
During an average of 7.2 years of follow-up, average systolic and diastolic BP increased, and 32.1% (512) of participants free from hypertension at baseline developed hypertension. NR3C2 SNPs rs7694064 and rs6856803 were significantly associated with longitudinal changes in systolic BP (P interaction = 6.9Ã—10(-5) and 8.2Ã—10(-4), respectively). Through gene-based analysis, NR3C2 was found to be significantly associated with longitudinal systolic BP change (P value of 1.00Ã—10(-7)), even after removal of significant markers rs7694064 and rs6856803 from the analysis. The association between NR3C2 and longitudinal systolic BP change was replicated in Asian MESA participants (P value of 1.00Ã—10(-4)).


CONCLUSIONS
These findings indicate that NR3C2 may play an important role in BP progression and development of hypertension.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""William J.

d64fd97e78f4e87d9cd225985e3e941eef8f7e55,MEG Beamformer-Based Reconstructions of Functional Networks in Mild Cognitive Impairment,"Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their functional brain networks are presumably already altered. To test this hypothesis, we compared magnetoencephalography (MEG) eyes-closed resting-state recordings from 29 MCI subjects and 29 healthy elderly subjects in the present exploratory study. Functional connectivity in different frequency bands was assessed with the phase lag index (PLI) in source space. Normalized weighted clustering coefficient (normalized Cw) and path length (normalized Lw), as well as network measures derived from the minimum spanning tree [MST; i.e., betweenness centrality (BC) and node degree], were calculated. First, we found altered PLI values in the lower and upper alpha bands in MCI patients compared to controls. Thereafter, we explored network differences in these frequency bands. Normalized Cw and Lw did not differ between the groups, whereas BC and node degree of the MST differed, although these differences did not survive correction for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR). As an exploratory study, we may conclude that: (1) the increases and decreases observed in PLI values in lower and upper alpha bands in MCI patients may be interpreted as a dual pattern of disconnection and aberrant functioning; (2) network measures are in line with connectivity findings, indicating a lower efficiency of the brain networks in MCI patients; (3) the MST centrality measures are more sensitive to detect subtle differences in the functional brain networks in MCI than traditional graph theoretical metrics.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""MarÃ­a Eugenia LÃ³pez"", ids = ""145902643""); list(name = ""Marjolein M.

b46f98aeaa0b5ffa805219c0986d55f2e953ee5e,Nightshift work and genome-wide DNA methylation.,"The negative health effects of shift work, including carcinogenesis, may be mediated by changes in DNA methylation, particularly in the circadian genes. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Array (Illumina, San Diego, CA), we compared genome-wide methylation between 65 actively working dayshift workers and 59 actively working nightshift workers in the healthcare industry. A total of 473â€‰800 loci, including 391 loci across the 12 core circadian genes, were analyzed to identify methylation markers associated with shift work status using linear regression models adjusted for gender, age, body mass index, race, smoking status and leukocyte cell profile as measured by flow cytometry. Analyses at the level of gene, CpG island and gene region were also conducted. To account for multiple comparisons, we controlled the false discovery rate (FDR â‰¤0.05). Significant differences between nightshift and dayshift workers were found at 16â€‰135 of 473â€‰800 loci, across 3769 of 20â€‰164 genes, across 7173 of 22â€‰721 CpG islands and across 5508 of 51â€‰843 gene regions. For each significant loci, gene, CpG island or gene region, average methylation was consistently found to be decreased among nightshift workers compared to dayshift workers. Twenty-one loci located in the circadian genes were also found to be significantly hypomethylated among nightshift workers. The largest differences were observed for three loci located in the gene body of PER3. A total of nine significant loci were found in the CSNK1E gene, most of which were located in a CpG island and near the transcription start site of the gene. Methylation changes in these circadian genes may lead to altered expression of these genes which has been associated with cancer in previous studies. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that among the significantly hypomethylated genes, processes related to host defense and immunity were represented. Our results indicate that the health effects of shift work may be mediated by hypomethylation of a wide variety of genes, including those related to circadian rhythms.

f23991ceb9e872cd23fd35090a8b825de8caff13,Beginning to offer drinking water at birth increases the species richness and the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium in the gut of preweaned dairy calves.,"We previously demonstrated that dairy calves having access to drinking water since birth (W0) achieved greater body weight, fiber digestibility, and feed efficiency than those that first received drinking water at 17 d of age (W17). Since gut microbiota composition could be linked to growth and development of animals, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of offering drinking water to newborn calves on composition of bacteria in the gut using a fecal microbiota analysis. Fresh feces were collected directly from the rectum of calves in W0 (n = 14) and W17 (n = 15) at 2, 6, and 10 wk of age. All of the calves were fed pasteurized waste milk, weaned at 7 wk of age, and offered tap water according to the treatment. The DNA was sequenced using 16S rRNA gene-amplicon sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) with a 99% similarity threshold. Treatment effects on Î±-diversity indices and relative abundance of the 10 most abundant genera were analyzed using GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Statistical significance (q-value) of treatment effects on the 50 most abundant OTU was determined with a false discovery rate analysis. At 2 wk of age, W0 had a greater number of observed OTU (5,908 vs. 4,698) and species richness (Chao 1 index) than W17. The number of OTU and richness indices increased from wk 2 to 6, but the increment of W17 was greater than that of W0. The Shannon and inverse-Simpson indices increased linearly with age, but no difference was observed between W0 and W17 at any time point. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratios were also similar at every time point but decreased markedly when calves were weaned. The relative abundance of genera Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides was greater in W0 than W17 at 2 wk of age. The genus Faecalibacterium continued to be more abundant in W0 than W17 at 6 wk of age but had similar abundance 3 wk after weaning (10 wk of age). The abundance of Faecalibacterium at wk 6 was positively correlated with apparent total-tract digestibility of acid detergent fiber at 10 wk of age. Calves receiving water since birth had greater abundance of OTU related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bifidobacterium breve at 6 wk of age (q < 0.085). These species are known to improve growth in preweaned calves. The abundance of none of the genera and OTU was different between W0 at W17 at 10 wk of age (q > 0.100). Overall, beginning to offer drinking water at birth has a potential to modulate gut microbiota composition and thereby positively affect performance of young dairy heifer calves (â‰¤10 wk of age).",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Handagala Kaluwalaya Janaka Priyankara Wickramasinghe"", ids = ""1473657243""); list(name = ""Justin M.

ed0d500db762531ca6a00de0272cc46ff0e2213e,Strength of functional signature correlates with effect size in autism,"BackgroundDisagreements over genetic signatures associated with disease have been particularly prominent in the field of psychiatric genetics, creating a sharp divide between disease burdens attributed to common and rare variation, with study designs independently targeting each. Meta-analysis within each of these study designs is routine, whether using raw data or summary statistics, but combining results across study designs is atypical. However, tests of functional convergence are used across all study designs, where candidate gene sets are assessed for overlaps with previously known properties. This suggests one possible avenue for combining not study data, but the functional conclusions that they reach.MethodIn this work, we test for functional convergence in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across different study types, and specifically whether the degree to which a gene is implicated in autism is correlated with the degree to which it drives functional convergence. Because different study designs are distinguishable by their differences in effect size, this also provides a unified means of incorporating the impact of study design into the analysis of convergence.ResultsWe detected remarkably significant positive trends in aggregate (pâ€‰<â€‰2.2e-16) with 14 individually significant properties (false discovery rate <0.01), many in areas researchers have targeted based on different reasoning, such as the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interactor enrichment (false discovery rate 0.003).We are also able to detect novel technical effects and we see that network enrichment from proteinâ€“protein interaction data is heavily confounded with study design, arising readily in control data.ConclusionsWe see a convergent functional signal for a subset of known and novel functions in ASD from all sources of genetic variation. Meta-analytic approaches explicitly accounting for different study designs can be adapted to other diseases to discover novel functional associations and increase statistical power.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sara Ballouz"", ids = ""2342741""); list(name = ""Jesse Gillis"", ids = ""51031361"")",e40059c926104c322b10501b0f5634b3ab34f82e; a72edf12f430bbb077f5cf2d0adcb208408f3888; 173886b37b0df87e59b5a00cd645ffd331b35243; d4a6c89a3299dd2f6870aa2cd1e12c4da883a29d; 482af5eeae9ac4c1a7eb63ab256eaebedfdd1fb8; 53eb720bbef3b5f703e4e7069fd52daff332a95a,34f935e7360f2138d6aeccdb2e59d8983afcebc2; e3302e999c294ae4e2115b495092625d417aeaf0; f44ff0677dd1fc960f5cdf9d2ef4f8a5a56ba77d; 7cdead5f2ad8a51972ba3ba992a61168e8e11650; 3c423f11a016b4fd8e170c08cf7dbef20eadb2d7; 1f2e502091a2e23615e1c10f415f1cbfd81b7bf4; 927156050101c0d53bc0b6f2e52f153638d56a0b; ea1181299e60a719836f090312938144ce736ca1; 56793ee97ea91d14b5f397846abe9980eff93222; a9ad058d2706fbdbf059af6b6bfda41deb1b3a1c; fb39910b70a3db7821fa784b7c3bfd33d002ff00; 8bb4edd64efb6746c02d06f3ffe114144dad7e49; 826285af6bac0df2583bad0fc650d49e050f5ff4; 4ac24482fee0652d3d83ca8a30477004a3d180df; 0daf00932712fc6331a171911cea4681ab7a668e; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; b41cdbef637e7cf656765fd051a02db21a6edf5a; fdd167f2b597682f6c4237b3e560f1bdfccdcc18; 85ba06eb632e5ea9bd36b22f1ed8592b31b349f7; 95a519513ac14770e865b04badc14705c4aa0b80; c13d8765aee9fd0b9492b5804edeb83ec7fc347b; 088043e4949ed32f29798a8954f38e7f9059da83; d56b981091deb6286078833db6ca8729aaf0e6d2; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; e8e7e984f6e42d8b5f15da5d380d19fc6a903b0b; da6de7ec04292e25f98bbad5912382f07bdfc6d0; b798e74cf8954daae13e4b31c4fed5f4a78035ec; 7876554e4923f27f33816dc406601735e17ccddb; bbe1b4b6b7b8fe7a5d9f15248fa490756289ded3; d244ba9e48a3afd4e67935a98a2d49272911f6ee; 4a34c5fac74d7e50422b19373f0d65d73ef1887e; be9b3f0802ab52f423f80fdb7251e6d982924a63; cd9ec1bd7ee19941bdb50a9484babadadbeeb32d; 70b799d8e6d952ee4919e982a86f1e40cf0f801f; 5dcb131e1b335b14f712e31bc6a487e697f1b29b; 37350821d59d0b2f476ccacf71b41b2cccaa6e73; 320976083dc59e9a7b1f69ba8d42b8a128b6383b; d868486f256994e1a6a7c94780af714f2974ecc7; a8470bce6bc237b1eacd0881ea98ab1968ead149; 598164cef461ecdd15fa3518c0158d58cb5019c1; e3bbae2ebe7f396922979e8818d0dfb073b10357; dcd0e6e3f258d49e79caa1eebdacc9d9ce1eda3d; b0bf39cc6527526ade178b2a1970c9948fafef00; da993417b4f304ea54304522af42017cd9ebb09e; 9b705fbedd3ccae824095bf8eebf6124ccc787d0; 557e1bf9a438658700f377f5f3dd7d67ec7e13f5; 412e7a247b7e6bfb0beb640508c94c2a0e376629; 10b97062bbe2df60830c23c655198206caa53de7; 3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; e6db2e5f371a62ede8f13864b97721a5d6aa484a; 2b4ba8636a1a3d8fdb20ab19652d16203050230e; 85e254c690926511d796a19f3b79e67f1e592411; 39990d887387b14f6d8e6918b37c6f8ea93bf8ff; d3b882ff67b7f0a1f65501cd69837a211ae884df; a6d2cc4c78098cb50292aa3bb67b98d0ec64aa52; 100958c808b7109593d14bcc577f4abe4163e4f9; 62f1fbae54a44ba0ac25d27a156106ff00961e30; 0e7f544818e09923176c52d87f321920c9274ae6; 3f5ee279ecb9d38ecb00168b6cd5d11856d6c868; ddc2038a40edc07fdfcf729e7d92d37841acbcb6; 6509e32048b95c233cca1fd9e40cb9cbcacf2bfd; 47e502d3f677b9995f2c4909dc5c0f6455ae3db2; 328ffc2e64c790a9467503c3ba37cca3f9ab66a7; 122b231f10c7693d8adb51eacd8b5106edc50278; 5d072e1f60105ab4d017faa031a79b419f3d01f5; ee3d8d86dc2062ef8a6e2bc1a3285c56a33e12f9; 8b5904f09ea28a8956746763b5ab3952972216cd; 64acb315b6129061c62bfabef2ac06d1a6fff95b,Genome Medicine,9,

Is there any difference in the protein composition of the endometrial fluid aspirate (EFA) obtained the day of embryo transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles achieving and not achieving pregnancy?


SUMMARY ANSWER
Comparative analysis identified a differential protein expression pattern in 'implantative' and 'non-implantative' IVF cycles.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
EFA allows non-invasive characterization of the endometrium, and may contain important information on its receptivity when performing (IVF) cycles. Endometrial side of implantation has usually been studied with endometrial biopsy in an IVF cycle prior to embryo transfer, focusing on 'receptive/non-receptive' endometria and with low-throughput proteomic techniques.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
We have compared the protein expression patterns in EFA from a total of 110 women undergoing IVF, corresponding to 50 implantative and 60 non-implantative IVF cycles. Discovery (38 patients) and Validation (42 patients) sample cohorts were analyzed using a high-throughput differential proteomic approach. Then, the differential expression of glycogen phosphorylase B (PYGB) was validated by western blotting in an additional cohort (30 patients). The study period was 18 months.


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
The population under study consisted of 110 women aged 18-40 years old, undergoing their first or second IVF/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle, with normal uterus and endometrium, and 1-2 good quality embryos, and embryo transfer being performed on Day 3. Endometrial fluid aspiration was performed immediately before the embryo transfer. Samples (80) were initially distributed in two independent cohorts and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The first cohort was used for the discovery and the second for the validation of the results. Filter-aided sample preparation was used for the in-solution tryptic digestion of the proteins present in the samples, followed by label-free mass spectrometry analysis. In order to unravel the molecular features of receptivity, the lists of differential proteins were thoroughly analyzed using different bioinformatic tools, including GSEA, IPA and GO analysis.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
A false discovery rate-based correction of the t-test P-values was carried out in order to strengthen the reliability of the results. Functional analyses denoted the deregulation of important processes governing receptivity, such as antimicrobial response, cell-cell interaction, immune response and inflammatory signaling, among others. Overall eight proteins were commonly deregulated in both studied datasets and brain form glycogen phosphorylase (PYGB) was selected for confirmatory analysis.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
Our results were obtained from patients with normal uterus and endometrium and with good quality embryos, who had fresh Day-3 embryo transfer, in stimulated cycles. Therefore, our observations may not be applicable to poor prognosis cases or non-stimulated cycles.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
This work provides insights into the molecular features of implantative IVF cycles using non-invasive methods. It reveals that EFA may reflect an increased inflammatory state in non-implantative endometrium. Additionally, it proposes PYGB as a potential biomarker for endometrial receptivity or implantation success. This knowledge opens a new avenue for developing embryo transfer strategies, through the improvement of embryo culture media or modifying endometrial fluid composition to increase pregnancy rates.

2154238fbe486c5b981fb7bf7e6f25517947f113,MotifMap: a human genome-wide map of candidate regulatory motif sites,"MOTIVATION
Achieving a comprehensive map of all the regulatory elements encoded in the human genome is a fundamental challenge of biomedical research. So far, only a small fraction of the regulatory elements have been characterized, and there is great interest in applying computational techniques to systematically discover these elements. Such efforts, however, have been significantly hindered by the overwhelming size of non-coding DNA regions and the statistical variability and complex spatial organizations of mammalian regulatory elements.


RESULTS
Here we combine information from multiple mammalian genomes to derive the first fairly comprehensive map of regulatory elements in the human genome. We develop a procedure for identifying regulatory sites, with high levels of conservation across different species, using a new scoring scheme, the Bayesian branch length score (BBLS). Using BBLS, we predict 1.5 million regulatory sites, corresponding to 380 known regulatory motifs, with an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of <50%. We demonstrate that the method is particularly effective for 155 motifs, for which 121 056 sites can be mapped with an estimated FDR of <10%. Over 28K SNPs are located in regions overlapping the 1.5 million predicted motif sites, suggesting potential functional implications for these SNPs. We have deposited these elements in a database and created a user-friendly web server for the retrieval, analysis and visualization of these elements. The initial map provides a systematic view of gene regulation in the genome, which will be refined as additional motifs become available.",2009,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohui Xie"", ids = ""2834988""); list(name = ""Paul Rigor"", ids = ""2359789""); list(name = ""Pierre Baldi"", ids = ""144902513"")",a0a7a552634c860eb25cff63d5905b497dec6b17; 89bc1849e15155b2799bca3c71b5fc9286851094; 79690492f96e39725bef86d75715b9f9ed9d07a2; b180c29e2eb2bb61dd3e1870af72bcfd7171a4d0; 92084e60ead2863038a9d8508da6e6898def0d14; 7d68c1c853b053816334f6fa59696b34b33b2839; a118669998b559d6ca8192fd65b4bdd54f5b95be; 48bf71767f5cc6e7de641b048fcdb295829ba858; 6e925a63c923f230f72426eb856f280b77cc44c7; 62d1bcef7def354de0eb78f25ade315874492fdf; ab129d9c2b07663504f216aa470cb3e5eb2e8f6d; 1d7537284a0e0989198796232df896e2ce389fe0; 219136313c7876bab942815e89670ffd1cf80cc1; 6e8f733034701bcc1e958d3705b5e27fde18ed3e; a5ab88b9f9b4073bd75bf889d15932f0c477c5f4; dc13914ba090f3197ebccf39ab0787a8fcc35949; 98d228fe16ba56eebdce10e51a724ca38523ba1b; 4fa2adba915171f52ee0e960079804ef03edb772; 626403279ac43278ec57ad138c5982b27a80f209; f82ac7e7c17e5c810d756191ef123c5d3b01e301; 600eb95ea0532135a1cec95b042833174a4b40ff; ac3cbefb2015b2f5125f0422ad9817c081d57587; 8183e15c4e009b47784a005edf696d18242cd5e2; 44f1af8d626c7ae640161ba200f8d7c14915a4ce; 71663b399303db25b33fa1d816a27c24542c5c5a; 6ba673cb8e24e53028315003fd198d79205d2be8; e7e2faa2c0cbc93322888595174ae96635f23780; a585084bc9413a753da8265878290b44bb492574; 8523b2f4b7e563a1aab19df73165f17b152d8199; 4d71d6d4d6d485f68d523d6a45ab2ae742ba5e57; 309ad8ac7fc98365e61844fcb42d93436b172743; 7976a17704e54f71ef9c04d55b572424497834b0; e30136a6fcabf755cfce770b41029023d4752c22; e20a466815bfa4e593b399cf21394d70594d1abf; 7d5ce295624929205dd78304a440246fea15661d; 5f2cb73f17e76a67af78fe88bb5c93280800bdc1; ae35c34de6ac1597b98bb798a662b84bee20c245; f18a3988b5b73c5bfafbbcd1f334329b9436965b; 8a15b030b56d80700f78b4da894cf22f22b3e097; 9b77740c1882e7c148eb7a56f99f73777dff408a; aa8cd9b6126da24d6e772a6973e82b5443537780; 7588aff104fb50067e32c62d6d9f1c5b6da279d0; afcb521298f5501bc9b5f7f6e4881ba56619ec0f; e7e02b0de9664224c3ea9427742c1fff32a0ce1b; 9c18bddd8d95197690282692541ed82833f53d5c; eb1dc16feeef9aeff1a560befcea25063d616cf1; 2dba06243e97ae6174b7ea45e5529985b3fc3fa2; 945bddcb8a6eebdf092bf5bbde9553e649efd3d4; dd8a7779f7ecec287d536aa35a58dcce87ccecf2; 945b8314ffa346eb99f1018835c2cc16fd623e73; 4b56ad9aad16a6f70e32104f74a658ed3744f151; a9eda14e8716fbe0a25bd56ec3b8463982657da4; 27652580171b791e7a34ed0538e9f203346a1b82; 458da8a66142d2f032df58a393070f553306b493; c0641347ab86c714945a7d664816bcc343b39cbb; c8e68df95380b4b3d6391bac0c182c58dd53ef6c; f6eab73c13b215a7ec6305b753e438c19944b8b4; 8d1cad5cf7e6c471b18acbbbe9bc093a7f65486b; 9a6a9b24209ed6fafad83ea1199bd5cc5ddc2fd8; ca19d60753029540b3fcad1ff52d12215855a0b1; 01d4e573b2855fd8d78cf7a03493162351015783; 372b477519c313f1cdee84a46088bf07ea1eb4a2; f7fd125480adc70d0369ed85413f334d706ba219; 4d0fbdea4fd667e9b9990285c1a8d7755155c9d7; 442dc0752695a50e7f79a9998262e8661c367f5f; 40c39aecdd9c0cb82ec62415e337865ac3d90308; e15f58fae6ed66b7f9d0a18bf712e0c3a43417af; 2e248eaca939e436f9c15a62a8cbb74a9748ed03; 10d5c544461f0809243865705e02b8498e1ebfde; 632552acf9679f82acf3b027c778c69eb3412bf5; 14a926755d46fae77372fe59b225c8ca09b15f77; 047738d2d1b8d0b1c6e5283d729e5d467dffd95d,117ef21b2799ec2dc0a9ab83378c35234ab38db2; 92aecd8bac4ac5a9c867a2ccca92cc5ceb535c4f; 06dfd1afc012c17fe5b41a04376ffa06059e2252; b17c7cc300de3efe7021d39f6c7cb35784f9e8a0; 4d79559d86a1aa954b6753456111ba879e9e3fd9; 1a5364b50df4f3b02ce6342be86d2f7c9d34587d; 19cac7cc664e92a5019e4bac9e170d19417d36e9; 05222402b5a48487fbde444d62fc631c96d6be13; 27cb6429a23f7fb888acdcb66fc4b4bde84cbbf9; 13ffc16cddf034c54e08daf578ab7935e62c6e41; d68bb77f29ce1b19e13166f16c81e3841f03d8db; 9d0708a0aafc914e2546218d6680b0fc10d75985; d5837fd1cf0d51e547553c3612928de880a08589; 699f57ebe5d8a79d25adb0f01b349f5a876d3e67; c5d15702ed2bed2160e668ce5197c1005db8ca70; 9c6bf5157ad2fb538089de9fc9c3c453025d4d17; fc494541afd64713789c4333dab7b0d9c876e7a2; cd7763d7c118bc875ea34b30b52d0d95257b1418; c482d33aa96ff447f2c92568f849320f890f459a; bccd776aa3cf5176eaffef18c2cecfe26b51f961; bb478fc83df4331b8603de59a50085946cf941c1; 2ababee3d0810c986c2db28e188d8e1b70e8e6ca; e049bd1ef18a0f1cdb45477d957393cf9ef41c6d; 9420b14db11f023e1cd93aa25bdccc7c0f055b70,Bioinformatics,25 2,"

The proposed approach calculates the p-value of test statistic using the Monte Carlo method and classifies genes by controlling the overall false discovery rate. We also estimate the positive false discovery rate of each pattern.

d38dafcf7540e963d732b773c28856653040ce2a,An Environment-Wide Study of Adult Cognitive Performance in the 23andMe Cohort,"BACKGROUND: With the emergence of web-based data collection methods, large digital health cohorts offer the opportunity to conduct behavioral and epidemiologic research at an unprecedented scale. The size and breadth of such data sets enable discovery of novel associations across the phenotypic spectrum. 
METHODS: We deployed the digital symbol substitution test (DSST) online to consented 23andMe research participants 50-85 years of age. We tested cross-sectional associations between DSST performance and 824 phenotypes using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, age*sex interaction, device, time of cohort entry, and ancestry, separately among discovery (n=144,786) and replication (n=93,428) samples; additional analyses further adjusted for education. We post-stratified association estimates on age, sex, and education to adjust for discrepancies across subsamples. Leveraging the rich genetic and phenotypic data available at 23andMe, we also estimated genetic and environmental correlations between DSST and its top correlates using linkage disequilibrium score regression. 
RESULTS: 97 phenotypes were significantly (false discovery rate |0.5|) associated with DSST performance in the discovery phase. Of those, 60 (38 with additional adjustment for education) demonstrated both statistical significance and consistent direction of association in the replication sample. The significantly associated phenotypes largely clustered into the following categories: psychiatric traits (e.g. anxiety, Î² per 1 SD = -0.74, P-value=3.9x10-169), education (e.g. highest math class completed, Î² per 1 SD = 2.11, P-value <1 x 10-300), leisure activities (e.g. solitary activities like puzzles, Î² per 1 SD = 1.85, P-value <1.0x10-300), social determinants (e.g. household income, Î² per 1 SD = 1.20, P-value= 8.9x10-245, and lifestyle (e.g. years smoked, Î² per 1 SD = -0.98, P-value= 2.2x10-78). We identified several reproducible genetic correlations between DSST and its top associated exposures (e.g. 0.48 for leisure activities like puzzles, 0.28 for years of education, and -0.24 for anxiety; all P â‰¤ 7.9x10-26). For almost all exposures, genetic correlations with DSST were considerably stronger than environmental correlations. 
CONCLUSIONS: We have conducted the largest study of cognitive performance to date, building evidence supporting its correlations with many social, lifestyle, and clinical exposures. We established that the observed associations are in part underpinned by shared genetic architecture. Our study illustrates the potential of large-scale digital cohorts to contribute to epidemiologic discovery.",2019,,"list(name = ""Yunru Huang"", ids = ""48356138""); list(name = ""Teresa Jenica Filshtein"", ids = ""46626026""); list(name = ""Robert Gentleman"", ids = ""48482572""); list(name = ""Stella Aslibekyan"", ids = ""108687965"")",,,medRxiv,,19009076
73c2fe6a217272e025c1316b44d7363e13566dae,Identifying CpG sites associated with eczema via random forest screening of epigenome-scale DNA methylation,"BackgroundThe prevalence of eczema is increasing in industrialized nations. Limited evidence has shown the association of DNA methylation (DNA-M) with eczema. We explored this association at the epigenome-scale to better understand the role of DNA-M.Data from the first generation (F1) of the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort participants and the second generation (F2) were examined in our study. Epigenome-scale DNA methylation of F1 at age 18Â years and F2 in cord blood was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. A total of 307,357 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) in the F1 generation were screened via recursive random forest (RF) for their potential association with eczema at age 18. Functional enrichment and pathway analysis of resulting genes were carried out using DAVID gene functional classification tool. Log-linear models were performed in F1 to corroborate the identified CpGs. Findings in F1 were further replicated in F2.ResultsThe recursive RF yielded 140 CpGs, 88 of which showed statistically significant associations with eczema at age 18, corroborated by log-linear models after controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05. These CpGs were enriched among many biological pathways, including pathways related to creating transcriptional variety and pathways mechanistically linked to eczema such as cadherins, cell adhesion, gap junctions, tight junctions, melanogenesis, and apoptosis. In the F2 generation, about half of the 83 CpGs identified in F1 showed the same direction of association with eczema risk as in F1, of which two CpGs were significantly associated with eczema risk, cg04850479 of the PROZ gene (risk ratio (RR)â€‰=â€‰15.1 in F1, 95Â % confidence interval (CI) 1.71, 79.5; RRâ€‰=â€‰6.82 in F2, 95Â % CI 1.52, 30.62) and cg01427769 of the NEU1 gene (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.13 in F1, 95Â % CI 0.03, 0.46; RRâ€‰=â€‰0.09 in F2, 95Â % CI 0.03, 0.36).ConclusionsVia epigenome-scaled analyses using recursive RF followed by log-linear models, we identified 88 CpGs associated with eczema in F1, of which 41 were replicated in F2. Several identified CpGs are located within genes in biological pathways relating to skin barrier integrity, which is central to the pathogenesis of eczema. Novel genes associated with eczema risk were identified (e.g., the PROZ and NEU1 genes).",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bilal M Quraishi"", ids = ""4045042""); list(name = ""Hongmei Zhang"", ids = ""30133375""); list(name = ""Todd M.

c306f0a82f51b56e8b8f7f97e9566cdb6ba0998d,Lower gut microbiome diversity and higher abundance of proinflammatory genus Collinsella are associated with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,"There is increasing evidence for the role of gut microbial composition in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most serious form of NAFLD where inflammation causes liver damage that can progress to cirrhosis. We have characterized the gut microbiome composition in UK patients with biopsy-proven NASH (n = 65) and compared it to that in healthy controls (n = 76). We report a 7% lower Shannon alpha diversity in NASH patients without cirrhosis (n = 40) compared to controls (p = 2.7x 10-4) and a 14% drop in NASH patients with cirrhosis (n = 25, p = 5.0x 10-4). Beta diversity (Unweighted UniFrac distance) was also significantly reduced in both NASH (p = 5.6x 10-25) and NASH-cirrhosis (p = 8.1x 10-7) groups. The genus most strongly associated with NASH in this study was Collinsella (0.29% abundance in controls, 3.45% in NASH without cirrhosis (False Discovery Rate (FDR) p = .008), and 4.38% in NASH with cirrhosis (FDR p = .02)). This genus, which has been linked previously to obesity and atherosclerosis, was also positively correlated with fasting levels of triglycerides (p = .01) and total cholesterol (p = 1.2x 10-4) and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 2.8x 10-6) suggesting that some of the pathways present in this microbial genus may influence lipid metabolism in the host. In patients, we also found decreased abundance of some of the Ruminococcaceae which are known to produce high levels of short-chain fatty acids which can lower inflammation. This may thus contribute to pathology associated with NASH.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Stuart Astbury"", ids = ""9892883""); list(name = ""Edmond Atallah"", ids = ""15216622""); list(name = ""Amrita Vijay"", ids = ""32809029""); list(name = ""Guruprasad P Aithal"", ids = ""5280694""); list(name = ""Jane L Grove"", ids = ""114532449""); list(name = ""Ana M Valdes"", ids = ""153753281"")",731def3240158ba10f31faf6f48dd91fa8c032fd,,Gut microbes,,"

cdd4eba50d02d85560b9789084d9bb5445f37dcd,Abstract 4998: Genome-wide methylation profiling in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and frequently presents with an advanced disease. Although it has been shown that a variety of epigenetic alterations can cause molecular heterogeneity of liver tumors, these studies have focused on specific genes, especially oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. There is limited knowledge of the genome-wide methylation status in liver tumors and how this may potentially contribute to carcinogenesis and prognosis. We conducted genome-wide methylation profiling in a set of liver tumors. A pilot study was first performed on DNA from paired fresh frozen tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 5 patients. Genome-wide methylation profiles were created using Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChips. GenomeStudio was used to normalize data and to identify differentially methylated (DM) genes in tumor vs. normal tissue with False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment. Biological functions of the DM genes were assigned using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Of the 485,577 CpG loci studied, significant DM loci were observed between normal and tumor tissues at 4% (17,612 CpGs) with an adjusted p-value Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

Whether lifestyle interventions in obese pregnant women improve pregnancy metabolic profiles remains unknown. Our objectives were to determine the magnitude of change in metabolic measures during obese pregnancy, to indirectly compare these to similar profiles in a general pregnant population, and to determine the impact of a lifestyle intervention on change in metabolic measures in obese pregnant women.MethodsData from a randomised controlled trial of 1158 obese (BMI â‰¥â€‰30 kg/m2) pregnant women recruited from six UK inner-city obstetric departments were used. Women were randomised to either the UPBEAT intervention, a tailored complex lifestyle intervention focused on improving diet and physical activity, or standard antenatal care (control group). UPBEAT has been shown to improve diet and physical activity during pregnancy and up to 6-months postnatally in obese women and to reduce offspring adiposity at 6-months; it did not affect risk of gestational diabetes (the primary outcome). Change in the concentrations of 158 metabolic measures (129 lipids, 9 glycerides and phospholipids, and 20 low-molecular weight metabolites), quantified three times during pregnancy, were compared using multilevel models. The role of chance was assessed with a false discovery rate of 5% adjusted p values.ResultsAll very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles increased by 1.5â€“3 standard deviation units (SD) whereas intermediate density lipoprotein and specific (large, medium and small) LDL particles increased by 1â€“2 SD, between 16 and 36 weeksâ€™ gestation. Triglycerides increased by 2â€“3 SD, with more modest changes in other metabolites. Indirect comparisons suggest that the magnitudes of change across pregnancy in these obese women were 2- to 3-fold larger than in unselected women (n = 4260 in cross-sectional and 583 in longitudinalÂ analyses) from an independent, previously published, study. The intervention reduced the rate of increase in extremely large, very large, large and medium VLDL particles, particularly those containing triglycerides.ConclusionThere are marked changes in lipids and lipoproteins and more modest changes in other metabolites across pregnancy in obese women, with some evidence that this is more marked than in unselected pregnant women. The UPBEAT lifestyle intervention may contribute to a healthier metabolic profile in obese pregnant women, but our results require replication.Trial RegistrationUPBEAT was registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN89971375, on July 23, 2008 (prior to recruitment).",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Harriet L.

d2ed9204c795e33adaa99f3069843b06dd4f3c08,Knowledge about the presence or absence of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) can successfully discriminate amongst 32 TCGA cancer types,"Isoforms of human miRNAs (isomiRs) are constitutively expressed with tissue- and disease-subtype-dependencies. We studied 10 271 tumor datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate whether isomiRs can distinguish amongst 32 TCGA cancers. Unlike previous approaches, we built a classifier that relied solely on 'binarized' isomiR profiles: each isomiR is simply labeled as 'present' or 'absent'. The resulting classifier successfully labeled tumor datasets with an average sensitivity of 90% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 3%, surpassing the performance of expression-based classification. The classifier maintained its power even after a 15Ã— reduction in the number of isomiRs that were used for training. Notably, the classifier could correctly predict the cancer type in non-TCGA datasets from diverse platforms. Our analysis revealed that the most discriminatory isomiRs happen to also be differentially expressed between normal tissue and cancer. Even so, we find that these highly discriminating isomiRs have not been attracting the most research attention in the literature. Given their ability to successfully classify datasets from 32 cancers, isomiRs and our resulting 'Pan-cancer Atlas' of isomiR expression could serve as a suitable framework to explore novel cancer biomarkers.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Aristeidis G.

In the placenta, the master regulator of fetal growth and development, microRNAs shape the basic processes of trophoblast biology and specific microRNA have been associated with fetal growth. To comprehensively assess the role of microRNAs in placental function and fetal development, we have performed small RNA sequencing to profile placental microRNAs from two independent mother-infant cohorts: the Rhode Island Child Health Study (n=225) and the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (n=317). We modeled microRNA counts on infant birthweight percentile (BWP) in each cohort, while accounting for race, sex, parity and technical factors, using negative binomial generalized linear models. We identified microRNAs that were differentially expressed (DEmiRs) with BWP at false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 in both cohorts. hsa-miR-532-5p (miR-532) was positively associated with BWP in both cohorts. By integrating parallel whole transcriptome and small RNA sequencing in the RICHS cohort, we identified putative targets of miR-532. These targets are enriched for pathways involved in adipogenesis, adipocytokine signaling, energy metabolism and hypoxia response, and included Leptin, which we further demonstrated to have decreasing expression with increasing BWP, particularly in male infants. Overall, we have shown a robust and reproducible association of miR-532 with BWP, which could influence BWP through regulation of adipocytokines Leptin and Adiponectin.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Elizabeth M Kennedy"", ids = ""34519959""); list(name = ""Karen E.

f064bbc992b77633b2b8c32191a573b92493b188,Inter-network functional connectivity changes in patients with brain tumors: a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,"OBJECTIVE
Measuring functional connectivity (FC) and resting state networks (RSNs) using resting state functional MRI is a method of preoperative planning in patients with brain tumors. However, the baseline FC and RSNs are altered in patients with brain tumors. In this study, we examined changes in inter-network FC in patients with brain tumors.


METHODS
We performed region of interest (ROI)-ROI analysis of FC in 34 patients with supratentorial gliomas and 14 healthy subjects. We performed bivariate correlation analyses at the level of each subject. Resulting correlations were Fischer Z-transformed. The used nodes included 132 ROIs from the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas in addition to 32 ROIs representing the different functional brain networks. We investigated second-level effects by contrasting dummy encoded co-variates representing the effects of group membership on functional connectivity. The significant two-sided P-value with corrected false discovery rate was set to 0.05. We set the t contrast between the group of patients with brain tumors and the group of healthy subjects to detect the effects of tumors on inter-network connectivity.


RESULTS
Overall, the inter-network FC was significantly higher in patients with brain tumors compared to healthy subjects. The anterior and posterior cerebellar networks, as well as the supratentorial network, showed significantly higher connectivity in patients with brain tumors than in healthy subjects.


CONCLUSION
Although brain tumors affect the FC and RSNs, the current study showed higher baseline inter-network connectivity in patients with brain tumors, which could indicate an intrinsic neural compensatory mechanism.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hussam Metwali"", ids = ""6269382""); list(name = ""Mathijs Raemaekers"", ids = ""3011516""); list(name = ""Tamer Omar Ibrahim"", ids = ""49182114""); list(name = ""Amir Samii"", ids = ""1727961"")",,,World neurosurgery,,

However, the computational burden has been a major hurdle to apply epistasis test in the genome-wide scale due to a large number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs to be tested.ResultsWe have developed a set of three efficient programs, FastANOVA, COE and TEAM, that support epistasis test in a variety of problem settings in GWAS. These programs utilize permutation test to properly control error rate such as family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR). They guarantee to find the optimal solutions, and significantly speed up the process of epistasis detection in GWAS.ConclusionsA web server with user interface and source codes are available at the website http://www.csbio.unc.edu/epistasis/.

0f8547500702f08ed328e7d1cf3f40b1bb9b5866,On Throughput Maximization and Interference Avoidance in Cognitive Radios,"A crucial task for a network of cognitive radios is to detect occupied frequency bands, to protect transmissions of primary users, and to identify spectrum holes to maximize the utilization of wasted resources. This paper is motivated by the need to account for challenging constraints that naturally arise in such applications such as channel model uncertainties and demanding sensitivity constraints of the sensing devices. We propose false discovery rate (FDR) based cooperative strategies to sense the occupancy of the spectrum. The strategies we propose could either be used to maximize bandwidth utilization or to provide guarantees on incurred interference levels. The proposed strategies are robust to significant uncertainties such as lack of CSI, fading and shadowing effects. The key idea of the paper is that the twin objectives of bandwidth utilization and interference control can significantly benefit from group testing across all channels in contrast to conventionally employed channel-by-channel detection strategy. Furthermore, it is shown that the cooperative sensing strategy significantly reduces sensitivity requirements. We quantify the effect of channel occupancy rate on the required cooperation degree for achieving a guaranteed level of primary user protection.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""G.

ece7f5433ed6e9c00e150febafa80c7bbb27a7b8,RNA 3D Modules in Genome-Wide Predictions of RNA 2D Structure,"Recent experimental and computational progress has revealed a large potential for RNA structure in the genome. This has been driven by computational strategies that exploit multiple genomes of related organisms to identify common sequences and secondary structures. However, these computational approaches have two main challenges: they are computationally expensive and they have a relatively high false discovery rate (FDR). Simultaneously, RNA 3D structure analysis has revealed modules composed of non-canonical base pairs which occur in non-homologous positions, apparently by independent evolution. These modules can, for example, occur inside structural elements which in RNA 2D predictions appear as internal loops. Hence one question is if the use of such RNA 3D information can improve the prediction accuracy of RNA secondary structure at a genome-wide level. Here, we use RNAz in combination with 3D module prediction tools and apply them on a 13-way vertebrate sequence-based alignment. We find that RNA 3D modules predicted by metaRNAmodules and JAR3D are significantly enriched in the screened windows compared to their shuffled counterparts. The initially estimated FDR of 47.0% is lowered to below 25% when certain 3D module predictions are present in the window of the 2D prediction.

09ab1f4f346642ef3f02c45af74f85c13f339173,LVAD Therapy Induces Changes in Myocardial Glucose Metabolism and Clock Genes,"Purpose Myocardial recovery with LVAD therapy is challenging and unpredictable. Next generation sequencing technologies allow for quick, quantitative, and large scale measurements of gene expression in small amounts of tissue. Our primary goal was identify transcriptional changes in response to LVAD therapy. Methods Tissues were collected from patients before and after LVAD placement (n=14) along with controls (n=3). RNASeq analysis was done by using a custom targeted panel on the PGM sequencer. The RNA-sequencing data was filtered to keep the genes with nonzero reads for at least 13 samples per condition. The expression of 140 genes including cardiac, inflammatory and clock genes were analyzed in with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies. The differential expression analysis was conducted using edgeR (Empirical analysis of digital gene expression data in R) package in Bioconductor. The Bejamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate (FDR) to be no more than 0.05. Results After filtering there were 122 genes available for analysis. Differential gene expressions were determined between pre- and post- receiving LVAD after adjusting for the patient effect. PDK4 and PER1 were significantly higher post LVAD compared to pre LVAD tissues. Compared to non-failing control tissues, 25 genes were differentially expressed pre-LVAD. These genes included, MYH6, ABCC9, PLEKHA3, ATRLN1, GLS, UBE2B, CCL4 and WEE1. Conclusion PDK4 and PER1 expressions were significantly higher post LVAD. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is a key regulator of glucose metabolism. PER1 is a clock gene exhibiting rhythmic expression in human hearts. It has been shown that PER1 is involved in BP control and regulates renal sodium transport genes. Recent literature suggests that LVAD therapy improves hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, and daily insulin requirements. Glucose metabolism and clock proteins are altered with LVAD therapy but numerous other transcriptional changes persist.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kajari Dhar"", ids = ""48456322""); list(name = ""A Kc"", ids = ""66246627""); list(name = ""Fang Qiu"", ids = ""48389668""); list(name = ""Hesham E Basma"", ids = ""4318674""); list(name = ""John Y.

196e0d82f529a47fe0667056e4b0ef88ec117ceb,Rat mammary extracellular matrix composition and response to ibuprofen treatment during postpartum involution by differential GeLC-MS/MS analysis.,"Breast cancer patients diagnosed within five years following pregnancy have increased metastasis and decreased survival. A hallmark of postpartum biology that may contribute to this poor prognosis is mammary gland involution, involving massive epithelial cell death and dramatic stromal remodeling. Previous studies show pro-tumorigenic properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) isolated from rodent mammary glands undergoing postpartum involution. More recent work demonstrates systemic ibuprofen treatment during involution decreases its tumor-promotional nature. Utilizing a proteomics approach, we identified relative differences in the composition of mammary ECM isolated from nulliparous rats and those undergoing postpartum involution, with and without ibuprofen treatment. GeLC-MS/MS experiments resulted in 20327 peptide identifications that mapped to 884 proteins with a <0.02% false discovery rate. Label-free quantification yielded several ECM differences between nulliparous and involuting glands related to collagen-fiber organization, cell motility and attachment, and cytokine regulation. Increases in known pro-tumorigenic ECM proteins osteopontin, tenascin-C, and laminin-Î±1 and pro-inflammatory proteins STAT3 and CD68 further identify candidate mediators of breast cancer progression specific to the involution window. With postpartum ibuprofen treatment, decreases in tenascin-C and three laminin chains were revealed. Our data suggest novel ECM mediators of breast cancer progression and demonstrate a protective influence of ibuprofen on mammary ECM composition.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jenean H O'Brien"", ids = ""1394768054""); list(name = ""Lauren A.

Aiming to study how glioma cells respond to Î³-rays in terms of biological processes involved in cellular responses, we performed experiments at cellular context and gene expression analysis in U343-MG-a GBM cells irradiated with 1 Gy and collected at 6 h post-irradiation. The survival rate was approximately 61% for 1 Gy and was completely reduced at 16 Gy. By performing the microarray technique, 859 cDNA clones were analyzed. The Significance Analysis of Microarray algorithm indicated 196 significant expressed genes (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.42%): 67 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated genes, which belong to several classes: metabolism, adhesion/cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cell cycle/apoptosis, membrane transport, DNA repair/DNA damage signaling, transcription factor, intracellular signaling, and RNA processing. Differential expression patterns of five selected genes (HSPA9B, INPP5A, PIP5K1A, FANCG, and TPP2) observed by the microarray analysis were further confirmed by the quantitative real time RT-PCR method, which demonstrated an up-regulation status of those genes. These results indicate a broad spectrum of biological processes (which may reflect the radio-resistance of U343 cells) that were altered in irradiated glioma cells, so as to guarantee cell survival.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Cl Bassi"", ids = ""36609871""); list(name = ""S.

32f28b76d460f899e121221fd56764a91f3c6b9a,Genome-Wide Assessments Reveal Extremely High Levels of Polymorphism of Two Active Families of Mouse Endogenous Retroviral Elements,"Endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) in mice are significant genomic mutagens, causing approximately 10% of all reported spontaneous germ line mutations in laboratory strains. The majority of these mutations are due to insertions of two high copy ERV families, the IAP and ETn/MusD elements. This significant level of ongoing retrotranspositional activity suggests that inbred mice are highly variable in content of these two ERV groups. However, no comprehensive genome-wide studies have been performed to assess their level of polymorphism. Here we compared three test strains, for which sufficient genomic sequence is available, to each other and to the reference C57BL/6J genome and detected very high levels of insertional polymorphism for both ERV families, with an estimated false discovery rate of only 0.4%. Specifically, we found that at least 60% of IAP and 25% of ETn/MusD elements detected in any strain are absent in one or more of the other three strains. The polymorphic nature of a set of 40 ETn/MusD elements found within gene introns was confirmed using genomic PCR on DNA from a panel of mouse strains. For some cases, we detected gene-splicing abnormalities involving the ERV and obtained additional evidence for decreased gene expression in strains carrying the insertion. In total, we identified nearly 700 polymorphic IAP or ETn/MusD ERVs or solitary LTRs that reside in gene introns, providing potential candidates that may contribute to gene expression differences among strains. These extreme levels of polymorphism suggest that ERV insertions play a significant role in genetic drift of mouse lines.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Zhang"", ids = ""49890466""); list(name = ""Irina A.

METHODS
RNA was extracted from three 10-micron sections of the FPE tumor tissue obtained at the initial diagnosis from 353 patients entered between 1977 and 1984 into the surgery-only or surgery-plus BCG arms of NSABP C-01/C-02. Expression was quantified for 757 cancer-related and reference genes with RT-PCR.


RESULTS
Blocks from 270 patients were evaluable after pre-specified exclusions: 128 were stage II and 142 were stage III. All patients had â‰¥ 5-year follow up. In univariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, 148 genes exhibited a nominally significant (unadjusted p-value <0.05) linear association with recurrence-free interval (RFI) (7 genes pâ‰¤0.001, 66 genes 0.001<p<0.01; 75 genes 0.01â‰¤p<0.05). False discovery rate calculations suggest that about 25% of the 148 genes are expected to be false positives. Higher expression was associated with shorter RFI for 118 genes including SERPINB5, DUSP1, AKT3, TIMP1, ANXA2, RHOB (pâ‰¤ 0.001) and with longer RFI for 30 genes including BRCA1 (pâ‰¤0.001). The relationship between gene expression and RFI was similar for stage II and stage III patients for 143 of the 148 genes found to be significant. The largest cluster of genes is functionally related to extracellular matrix remodeling. The magnitude of the hazard ratios is similar to that observed in the early Oncotype DX studies in breast cancer and should allow clinically useful separation into low/intermediate/high risk groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Quantitative RT-PCR assay of FPE colon cancer tissue can be used to identify large numbers of genes associated with RFI in patients with stage II and III colon cancer. If these results are confirmed by additional studies in progress, this technique has promise to improve selection of colon cancer patients for adjuvant chemotherapy.

a09bfce46b5552fbdd230917f6e0926d5f17009a,Identification of critical areas for motor function recovery in chronic stroke subjects using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping,"INTRODUCTION
Previous stroke studies using fMRI or lesion characterization methods to study the preservation of motor performance have been limited in defining anatomical structure critical for functional performance. This study attempts to overcome this limitation by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) to identify specific anatomical regions required for preservation of motor function.


METHODS
Forty-one moderate to moderately severe stroke subjects (upper extremity Fugl-Meyer between 28 and 50, Arm Motor Ability Test >35) were imaged with a 1 mm isotropic T1-weighted volumetric sequence, and their motor performance was assessed. The T1 volume images were normalized to a symmetric template using SPM5 and oriented so the lesion appeared in the left hemisphere. The lesioned areas were manually segmented on the normalized T1 image. All 3D lesion maps were entered into the VLSM analysis. Areas showing significant correlations with functional performance measures were identified using the false discovery rate corrected at p< or =0.05.


RESULTS
The areas most correlated with a decrease in motor performance were at the junction of the corona radiata leading into the corticospinal tract. The Arm Motor Ability Test scores produced the most significant results, while the other measures showed similar anatomical patterns.


CONCLUSION
The use of lesion symptom mapping in conjunction with behavioral measures produced anatomically specific results demonstrating that the area leading from the corticospinal tract to cortical motor areas is critical for maintaining hand motor performance after a stroke. This area may represent the joining of parallel redundant tracts that, when damaged, limit recovery potential.",2010,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ryan Lo"", ids = ""38453612""); list(name = ""Darren R.

7368ccd32e544a70c65102f96f04ecab67723ac0,In-depth analysis of the Magnaporthe oryzae conidial proteome.,"The filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) is the causative agent of rice blast disease and presents a significant threat to worldwide rice production. To establish the groundwork for future research on the pathogenic development of M. oryzae, a global proteomic study of conidia was performed. The filter aided sample preparation method (FASP) and anion StageTip fractionation combined with long, optimized shallow 210 min nanoLC gradients prior to mass spectrometry analysis on an Orbitrap XL was applied, which resulted in a doubling of protein identifications in comparison to our previous GeLC analysis. Herein, we report the identification of 2912 conidial proteins at a 1% protein false discovery rate (FDR) and we present the most extensive study performed on M. oryzae conidia to date. A similar distribution between identified proteins and the predicted proteome was observed when subcellular localization analysis was performed, suggesting the detected proteins build a representative portion of the predicted proteome. A higher percentage of cytoplasmic proteins (associated with translation, energy, and metabolism) were observed in the conidial proteome relative to the whole predicted proteome. Conversely, nuclear and extracellular proteins were less well represented in the conidial proteome. Further analysis by gene ontology revealed biological insights into identified proteins important for central metabolic processes and the physiology of conidia.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Emine Gokce"", ids = ""11421756""); list(name = ""William L.

8dd951cf915b9182ff86b0e58c912d99f8371534,Trisomy of the Down Syndrome Critical Region Suppresses Precursor B-Cell Differentiation and Promotes B-Cell Transformation Associated with Altered Expression of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 Targets,"Abstract 115 Extra copies of chromosome 21 (polysomy 21) is the most common somatic aneuploidy in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), including >90% of cases with high hyperdiploidy. In addition, children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 20-fold increased risk of developing B-ALL, of which âˆ¼60% harbor CRLF2 rearrangements. To examine these associations within genetically defined models, we investigated B-lineage phenotypes in Ts1Rhr mice, which harbor triplication of 31 genes syntenic with the DS critical region (DSCR) on human chr.21. Murine pro-B cell (B220 + CD43 + ) development proceeds sequentially through â€œHardy fractionsâ€ defined by cell surface phenotype: A (CD24 âˆ’ BP-1 âˆ’ ), B (CD24 + BP-1 âˆ’ ) and then C (CD24 + BP-1 + ). Compared with otherwise isogenic wild-type littermates, Ts1Rhr bone marrow harbored decreased percentages of Hardy fraction B and C cells, indicating that DSCR triplication is sufficient to disrupt the Hardy A-to-B transition. Of note, the same phenotype was reported in human DS fetal liver B-cells, which have a block between the pre-pro- and pro-B cell stages (analogous to Hardy A-to-B). To determine whether DSCR triplication affects B-cell proliferation in vitro, we analyzed colony formation and serial replating in methylcellulose cultures. Ts1Rhr bone marrow (B6/FVB background) formed 2â€“3-fold more B-cell colonies in early passages compared to bone marrow from wild-type littermates. While wild-type B-cells could not serially replate beyond 4 passages, Ts1Rhr B-cells displayed indefinite serial replating (>10 passages). Ts1Rhr mice do not spontaneously develop leukemia, so we utilized two mouse models to determine whether DSCR triplication cooperates with leukemogenic oncogenes in vivo . First, we generated EÎ¼-CRLF2 F232C mice, which express the constitutively active CRLF2 mutant solely within B-cells. Like Ts1Rhr B-cells, (but not CRLF2 F232C B-cells) Ts1Rhr/CRLF2 F232C cells had indefinite serial replating potential. In contrast with Ts1Rhr B-cells, Ts1Rhr/CRLF2 F232C B-cells also engrafted into NOD.Scid.IL2RÎ³ âˆ’/âˆ’ mice and caused fatal and serially transplantable B-ALL. Second, we retrovirally transduced BCR-ABL1 into unselected bone marrow from wild-type and Ts1Rhr mice and transplanted into irradiated wild-type recipients. Transplantation of transduced Ts1Rhr cells (10 6 , 10 5 , or 10 4 ) caused fatal B-ALL in recipient mice with shorter latency and increased penetrance compared to recipients of the same number of transduced wild-type cells. By Poisson calculation, the number of B-ALL initiating cells in transduced Ts1Rhr bone marrow was âˆ¼4-fold higher than in wild-type animals (1:60 vs 1:244, P=0.0107). Strikingly, transplantation of individual Hardy A, B, and C fractions after sorting and BCR-ABL1 transduction demonstrated that the increased leukemia-initiating capacity almost completely resides in the Ts1Rhr Hardy B fraction; i.e., the same subset suppressed during Ts1Rhr B-cell differentiation. To define transcriptional determinants of these phenotypes, we performed RNAseq of Ts1Rhr and wild-type B cells in methylcellulose culture (n=3 biologic replicates per genotype). As expected, Ts1Rhr colonies had âˆ¼1.5-fold higher RNA abundance of expressed DSCR genes. We defined a Ts1Rhr signature of the top 200 genes (false discovery rate (FDR) 2,300 signatures in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) C2 Chemical and Genetic Perturbations with the Ts1Rhr signature identified enrichment in multiple gene sets of polycomb repressor complex (PRC2) targets and H3K27 trimethylation. Most notably, SUZ12 targets within human embryonic stem cells were more highly expressed in Ts1Rhr cells (P=1.2Ã—10 âˆ’6 , FDR=0.003) and the same SUZ12 signature was enriched in patients with DS-ALL compared to non-DS-ALL (P=0.007). In summary, DSCR triplication directly suppresses precursor B-cell differentiation and promotes B-cell transformation both in vitro and by cooperating with proliferative alterations such as CRLF2 activation and BCR-ABL1 in vivo. Pharmacologic modulation of H3K27me3 effectors may overcome the pro-leukemogenic effects of polysomy 21.

d5cdea6b77607546463f3195aef78acac68d06d9,A microRNA signature for the differential diagnosis of salivary gland tumors,"Salivary gland tumors (SGTs) are rare tumors of the head and neck with different clinical behavior. Preoperative diagnosis, based on instrumental and cytologic examinations, is crucial for their correct management. The identification of molecular markers might improve the accuracy of pre-surgical diagnosis helping to plan the proper treatment especially when a definitive diagnosis based only on cytomorphology cannot be achieved. miRNAs appear to be new promising biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Studies concerning the useful of miRNA expression in clinical decision-making regarding SGTs remain limited and controversial.The expression of a panel of 798 miRNAs was investigated using Nanostring technology in 14 patients with malignant SGTs (6 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 4 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 1 acinic cell carcinoma, 1 ductal carcinoma, 1 cystadenocarcinoma and 1 adenocarcinoma) and in 10 patients with benign SGTs (pleomorphic adenomas). The DNA Intelligent Analysis (DIANA)-miRPath v3.0 software was used to determinate the miRNA regulatory roles and to identify the controlled significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) molecular pathways. Forty six miRNAs were differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate-FDR<0.05) between malignant and benign SGTs. DIANA miRPath software revealed enriched pathways involved in cancer processes as well as tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, cell growth and survival, tumor suppressor expression, angiogenesis and tumor progression. Interestingly, clustering analysis showed that this signature of 46 miRNAs is able to differentiate the two analyzed groups.

faf964339378f61e5d90e4540820dc36f0e07a7f,Characterization of Visceral and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Transcriptome and Biological Pathways in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women: Evidence for Pregnancy-Related Regional-Specific Differences in Adipose Tissue,"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to compare the transcriptome of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues between pregnant and non-pregnant women.


STUDY DESIGN
The transcriptome of paired visceral and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissues from pregnant women at term and matched non-pregnant women (n = 11) was profiled with the Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST array. Differential expression of selected genes was validated with the use of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
Six hundred forty-four transcripts from 633 known genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1; fold-change >1.5), while 42 exons from 36 genes showed differential usage (difference in FIRMA scores >2 and FDR<0.1) between the visceral and subcutaneous fat of pregnant women. Fifty-six known genes were differentially expressed between pregnant and non-pregnant subcutaneous fat and three genes in the visceral fat. Enriched biological processes in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of pregnant women were mostly related to inflammation.


CONCLUSION
The transcriptome of visceral and subcutaneous fat depots reveals pregnancy-related gene expression and splicing differences in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Furthermore, for the first time, alternative splicing in adipose tissue has been associated with regional differences and human parturition.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shali Mazakiâ\200\220Tovi"", ids = ""1398245652""); list(name = ""Edi Vaisbuch"", ids = ""5267710""); list(name = ""Adi L Tarca"", ids = ""2490889""); list(name = ""Juan Pedro Kusanovic"", ids = ""1987876""); list(name = ""Nandor Gabor Than"", ids = ""3233577""); list(name = ""Tinnakorn Chaiworapongsa"", ids = ""3985187""); list(name = ""Zhong Dong"", ids = ""2345688""); list(name = ""Sonia S.

f1dbe40dcde885f6fdd27b0824a084695443a45e,Microarray data analysis reveals differentially expressed genes in prolactinoma.,"UNLABELLED
Gene expression profiles of prolactinomas were compared with those of normal pituitary glands to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and protein complex prediction were performed to reveal the cross-talk between these genes and molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Microarray data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. DEGs were screened using GEO2R and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was set as the cut-off. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with information from STRING and significant KEGG pathways were unveiled. Protein complexes were predicted using ClusterONE from Cytoscape and then validated in terms of pathways, protein domain, cellular localization and literatures. AÂ  total of 1712 genes (1911 probes) were found to be differentially expressed in prolactinoma. Interactions were identified among 121 protein products. Nineteen significant pathways (FDR< 0.05) were acquired and pathways in cancer was the top one. Pathways linked to myeloid leukemia and tryptophan metabolism were also enriched in the DEGs. Four protein complexes were predicted and then validated. They were associated with focal adhesion, cytoskeleton, metabolism of tryptophan, arginine and proline as well as aldehyde dehydrogenases. They might play important roles in the pathogenesis of prolactinoma. In present study, not only DEGs were provided, but also PPIs and protein complexes were discussed.

c21dde7f60fd7424d1252691bd922b1e81328cd4,Topics on statistical design and analysis of cDNA microarray experiment,"A microarray is a powerful tool for surveying the expression levels of many thousands of genes simultaneously. It belongs to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences.

In this thesis, we focus on the dual channel cDNA microarray which is one of the most popular microarray technologies and discuss three different topics: optimal experimental design; 
estimating the true proportion of true nulls, local false discovery rate (lFDR) and positive false discovery rate (pFDR) and dye effect normalization.

The first topic consists of four subtopics each of which is about an independent and practical problem of cDNA microarray experimental design. In the first subtopic, we propose an optimization strategy which is based on the simulated annealing method to find optimal or near-optimal designs with both biological and technical replicates. In the second subtopic, we discuss how to apply Q-criterion for the factorial design of microarray experiments. In the third subtopic, we suggest an optimal way of pooling samples, which is actually a replication scheme to minimize the variance of the experiment under the constraint of fixing the total cost at a certain level. In the fourth subtopic, we indicate
that the criterion for distant pair design is not proper and propose an alternative criterion instead.

The second topic of this thesis is dye effect normalization. For cDNA microarray technology, each array compares two samples which are usually labelled with different dyes Cy3 and Cy5. It assumes that: for a given gene (spot) on the array, if Cy3-labelled sample has k times as much of a transcript as the Cy5-labelled sample, then the Cy3 signal should be k times as high as the Cy5 signal, and vice versa. This important assumption requires that the dyes
should have the same properties. However, the reality is that the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes have slightly different properties and the relative efficiency of the dyes vary across the intensity range in a ""banana-shape"" way. In order to remove the dye effect, we propose a novel dye effect normalization method which is based on modeling dye response functions and dye effect curve. Real and simulated microarray data sets are used to evaluate the method. It shows that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactory.

The focus of the third topic is the estimation of the proportion of
true null hypotheses, lFDR and pFDR. In a typical microarray
experiment, a large number of gene expression data could be
measured. In order to find differential expressed genes, these
variables are usually screened by a statistical test simultaneously.
Since it is a case of multiple hypothesis testing, some kind of
adjustment should be made to the p-values resulted from the
statistical test. Lots of multiple testing error rates, such as FDR,
lFDR and pFDR have been proposed to address this issue. A key
related problem is the estimation of the proportion of true null
hypotheses (i.e. non-expressed genes). To model the distribution of
the p-values, we propose three kinds of finite mixture of unknown
number of components (the first component corresponds to
differentially expressed genes and the rest components correspond to
non-differentially expressed ones). We apply a new MCMC method
called allocation sampler to estimate the proportion of true null
(i.e. the mixture weight of the first component). The method also
provides a framework for estimating lFDR and pFDR. Two real
microarray data studies plus a small simulation study are used to
assess our method. We show that the performance of the proposed
method is satisfactory.",2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ximin Zhu"", ids = ""152558580"")",,3d451c22489e301998bc3d0e8bf07535a80565d6; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; 3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; a3365b65ed0f8fd2f4a5f42723be4970d9d7d9cf; 0862a628fcb1662aa94334ce878b40bc946897e3; 59370f88a21383172949c7798204cc4a80bcf323; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; f3adbd4737cec23e88fd0906ecb56e2fbb46e20d; 2fc99ad15eafd2f459938f5e4494bd02932d7495; 89a594ecacbf6c148b26a880cd892e7b6b69a1d7; 320db99852b7adb2b18fa57a200398e151c390b3; 3d4523d71179f7b4481c61b195f835439e4070c3; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; d640412f3dfb4b5539d8b8aab2e0e2d225f795ff; 1ea500400ae5c2aa2ea2b9f5669f614334597dd8; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 017ddb7e815236defd0566bc46f6ed8401cc6ba6; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; 604ee9ce5a7daa35020171b80b23f82eb7b3378a; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 53adfe99b4cc9c2a1a115de2832d9ead672ab94d; aa21536103308d8c46c4ab67473f2448bc8bd1f6; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; a44241bf4d932fc09bc683f211360c43f02fd106; 7eb19d792f25f8f437340957285ca40769030961; 37c2f613658f6d53742e46b3fc5b8cd802c334c1; 4048a87e0ddc56d7910a03bb43e77ea2dbbe6829; fd3d628f90e73744621c26421869d90e7eddeb3f; f1b1bc5f606145249b38217124345d85e6ec80a2; 92f9be0462a86b54d310130bb519fdb90c2e494b; e880e5d250226d57c5e0d9dd792506345c277e68; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; b82efeb542f6c6c70b04adfea7a6c39147990b25; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 116fed4779c786c01b875cea7941a02380e63651; 8719f1371434b47ec7c137b98bb9480f383c2966; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; 29b4cdd84e5b657339749c12028ec25310c79764; 6ce7876c0b2acb52b88610ce9cfe21d239c28922; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 3c6aaaef54e49da39f2a384ed19cfc99a101dd09; fe4b07489942fc80654e9a87663aee3aa5119429,,,
1812a0034c3d34075f97cf28f284c882bb5ca14d,Stigmasterol upregulates immediate early genes and promotes neuronal cytoarchitecture in primary hippocampal neurons as revealed by transcriptome analysis.,"BACKGROUND
The hippocampus is a vulnerable brain region that is implicated in learning and memory impairment by two pathophysiological features, that is, neurite regression and synaptic dysfunction, and stigmasterol (ST), a cholesterol-equivalent phytosterol, is known to facilitate neuromodulatory effects.


PURPOSE
To investigate the neuromodulatory effects of ST on the development of central nervous system neurons and the molecular bases of these effects in primary hippocampal neurons.


METHODS
Rat embryonic (E18-19) brain neurons were cultured in the absence or presence of ST (75â€¯ÂµM). Neuritogenic activities of ST were evident by increases in various morphometric parameters. To identify underlying affected genes, total RNA was isolated on day in vitro 12 (DIV 12) and mRNA high throughput sequencing (mRNA-Seq) was performed. Affected key genes for neuronal development were identified using bioinformatics tools and their upregulations were confirmed by immunocytochemistry.


RESULTS
Among the differentially expressed 17,337 RefSeq genes, 445 genes (up/down 293/157) passed the p-valueâ€¯<â€¯0.05 criterion, 52 genes (up/down; 37/13) had a p-valueâ€¯<â€¯0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) q-value ofâ€¯<â€¯0.2, and 24 genes (up/down; 20/4) passed the more stringent criterion of both pâ€¯<â€¯0.05 and qâ€¯<â€¯0.05. After applying a stringent FDR q-value cutoff ofâ€¯<â€¯0.2, it was found ST induced many immediate early genes (IEGs), and that a major proportion of upregulated genes were related to central nervous system (CNS) development (neurite outgrowth or synaptic transmission). In a Venn diagram for CNS development Gene Ontologies (GOs) (i.e., axon development, dendrite development, modulation of synaptic transmission), Reln emerged as a central player in these processes, and highly interconnected 'hub' genes, including Dcx, Egr1, Ntrk2, and Slc24a2, were revealed by gene co-expression networks. Finally, transcriptomic data was confirmed by immunocytochemistry of primary hippocampal neurons.


CONCLUSION
The study indicates that ST upregulates genes for neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, and suggests ST be viewed as a potential resource for improving brain functions.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Md Nazmul Haque"", ids = ""2891801""); list(name = ""Il Soo Moon"", ids = ""34929430"")",93fd40f206af42fefd73faa8ed601d8ba0008e2b; e290f0f8b93fd32a7aad14ff7c3fdd4af1f70d1b; dcd3842b7cd46276ad0423b69f5f45625da69793; 3cc95d22b6e2e0c04fbfa4c01b8e2f793403f605,,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,46,"

7105cc65865b9ee8cb4b3784242bf349ef9ad89c,Identification of maternally regulated fetal gene networks in the placenta with a novel embryo transfer system in mice.,"The mechanisms for provisioning maternal resources to offspring in placental mammals involve complex interactions between maternally regulated and fetally regulated gene networks in the placenta, a tissue that is derived from the zygote and therefore of fetal origin. Here we describe a novel use of an embryo transfer system in mice to identify gene networks in the placenta that are regulated by the mother. Mouse embryos from the same strain of inbred mice were transferred into a surrogate mother either of the same strain or from a different strain, allowing maternal and fetal effects on the placenta to be separated. After correction for sex and litter size, maternal strain overrode fetal strain as the key determinant of fetal weight (P < 0.0001). Computational filtering of the placental transcriptome revealed a group of 81 genes whose expression was solely dependent on the maternal strain [P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.10]. Network analysis of this group of genes yielded highest statistical significance for pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth (such as insulin-like growth factors) as well as those involved in regulating lipid metabolism [such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), LDL, and HDL], both of which are known to play a role in fetal development. This novel technique may be generally applied to identify regulatory networks involved in maternal-fetal interaction and eventually help identify molecular targets in disorders of fetal growth.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paranthaman Senthamaraikannan"", ids = ""10169095""); list(name = ""Maureen A.

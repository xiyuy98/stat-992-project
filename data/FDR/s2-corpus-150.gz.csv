However, despite the myriad imaging and genetic subtypes that have been identified, the underlying biological mechanisms of MRI features are seldom explained, and differentially regulated genes are rarely linked to the phenotypic appearance of tumours. In this study, we propose to fill this gap in knowledge by investigating the unbiased correlations between MRI phenotypes and differential gene expressions in breast cancer. Methods: Patients diagnosed during 2002-15 with invasive breast cancer who went through surgery were retrospectively reviewed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genomics analysis. In total, we collected dynamic contrast-enhanced subtraction MRI and RNA sequencing results of surgical specimens from a cohort of 56 patients. Of these, 31 patients (aged 33 to 72 years) met our inclusion criteria. Tumour lesion segmentation was performed by a radiologist who has 10 years of experience. We extracted features that quantitatively describe tumour appearance from the segmented lesions using pyradiomics (v2.0.0). We then grouped the tumours into two imaging subtypes using an unsupervised clustering approach (SIMLR, v1.10.0). To probe the underlying biological mechanisms behind the difference in tumour appearance, we performed differential expression analysis (edgeR, v3.26.5) and pathway enrichment analysis (g:profiler) between the two imaging subtypes. Multiple testing correction was conducted with Benjamini-Hochberg correction using a false discovery rate of 0.05. Results: We classified the breast tumours from our cohort into two imaging subtypes that have distinct levels of heterogeneity in texture (p=0.004). We found a list of genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the heterogenous (n=20) and homogenous (n=11) subtypes (Table 1), and their associated biological pathways. We found that the pathways controlling cell growth (p=0.022), cell migration and invasion (p=0.023), estrogen regulation (p=0.022) and DNA damage repair (p=0.015) mechanisms may have contributed to increased heterogeneity in tumour presentation when imaged with MRI. Conclusion: The underlying biological mechanisms affecting breast MRI texture can be investigated by linking tumour appearance to gene expression profiling. Our results suggest that texture heterogeneity in breast MRI could be linked to a number of differentially expressed genes that may be further investigated as a biomarker of cancer risk assessment or recurrence. Further studies with a larger cohort will be conducted to validate and extend these results.

ee5b3c27f1d18b8cb2dfea37707b0cdf0b98428f,Detection and accurate false discovery rate control of differentially methylated regions from whole genome bisulfite sequencing.,"With recent advances in sequencing technology, it is now feasible to measure DNA methylation at tens of millions of sites across the entire genome. In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of lists of regions and accurately controls the false discovery rate.",2019,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Keegan D.

The purpose of this article is to describe the two-step genetic and epigenetic approach that will be executed to explore Gene Ã— Environment interactions on BP using a longitudinal cohort design. Procedure for the single collection of DNA at Time 1 includes the use of the Oragene 500-format saliva sample collection tube, which provides enough DNA for both the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping and 850K EPIC methylation analyses. BP readings, height, weight, percentage of body fat, and percentage of body water will be measured on all participants every 6 months for 2 years for a total of 4 time points. Genomic data analyses to be completed include multivariate modeling, assessment of population admixture and structure, and extended analyses including Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate methods, Monte Carlo approach, EIGENSTRAT methods, and so on, to determine relationships among both main and interaction effects of genetic, epigenetic, and psychological environmental factors on BP.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jacquelyn Taylor"", ids = ""5256027""); list(name = ""Michelle L.

Here, we incorporate DMS data into automated secondary structure inference using an energy minimization framework developed for 2'-OH acylation (SHAPE) mapping. On six noncoding RNAs with crystallographic models, DMS-guided modeling achieves overall false negative and false discovery rates of 9.5% and 11.6%, respectively, comparable to or better than those of SHAPE-guided modeling, and bootstrapping provides straightforward confidence estimates.

0348d47c44283842123947f4b7e43f438c2f64c3,Upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) in dorsal root ganglion in a rat model of bone cancer pain,"Bone cancer pain is one of the most severe and intractable complications in patients suffering from primary or metastatic bone cancer and profoundly compromises the quality of life. Emerging evidence indicates that the dorsal root ganglion play an integral role in the modulation of pain hypersensitivity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms during dorsal root ganglion-mediated bone cancer pain remain elusive. In this study, RNA-sequencing was used to detect the differentially expressed genes in dorsal root ganglion neurons of a rat bone cancer pain model established by intratibial inoculation of Walker 256 breast cancer cells. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes (fold changeâ€‰>â€‰1.5; false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05) were enriched in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, transforming growth factor-Î² signaling pathway, and positive regulation of cartilage development. Importantly, serum deprivation-response protein (Sdpr), hephaestin (Heph), transthyretin (Ttr), insulin receptor substrate 1 (Irs1), connective tissue growth factor (Ctgfâ€‰), and Bmp2 genes were associated with bone pain and degeneration. Of note, Bmp2, a pleiotropic and secreted molecule mediating pain and inflammation, was one of the most significantly upregulated genes in dorsal root ganglion neurons in this bone cancer pain model. Consistent with these data, upregulation of Bmp2 in the bone cancer pain model was validated by immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. Importantly, intrathecal administration of siRNA significantly reduced Bmp2 transcription and ameliorated bone cancer pain in rat as shown by paw withdrawal mechanical threshold and spontaneous and movement-evoked pain-like behaviors. In conclusion, we have characterized the comprehensive gene expression profile of dorsal root ganglion from a bone cancer pain rat model by RNA-sequencing and identified Bmp2 as a potential therapeutic target for bone cancer pain treatment.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Wang"", ids = ""145749483""); list(name = ""Qiliang Jiang"", ids = ""7212161""); list(name = ""Jingxiang Wu"", ids = ""5088252""); list(name = ""Wei Tang"", ids = ""144149428""); list(name = ""Meiying Xu"", ids = ""49235644"")",,b9c3c508c00053038e45ba078db87c496250190c; 78ae8fd503620b89a81d60116deca54aee79985f; a4760abdebd2c2d10fbb8cc3b16bd6061fb5d69f; e1eb64a900129b5020256f033011953c9e79d1b2; 79ddc7623bef67003812727185934f2cd8e83fcf; 3fd17b4521757108839ab6726c4733ab7513601b; ce4fb0fad0eeb4bd794001d1d0b43b423a10c4f9; aee43331de469270555c3c9b4958e945705fcb11; fca442e8bda6e15d121e885aab49dd838bee512b; 686b964d463f19d5f770b544318e8bfedae1193a; 9e2dd3eabc281a141d5ef4c9207282dc671a1c26; e034a3f72efd5a763cc89b04e47a53199725678b; 8a0333d070f4a9c5171b5df46c480e7e195da5e5; 32ca02aeb12b93ef1101b2a1b00b26481e9de0b1; 11fbe1aec44e8e0496ae12e1dd39a039c67ac472; 49f85f5825c0d86247b8ffb47300fc589cf0e38c; f748f2216295b7fef05d2bfbb8811d8252112b48; 2d62ed6903dac88dbec6a2694730d22f8833ce0c; 50de3b55eaa2a314a865256a98a964b9b244a7a8; e0b68034c1a46cc270384abf40265ee01e4cf6b2; 720f176d0065144f7cfe5148731a7c766ea3d458; a008afdfe8619838357c4364d7b4c4b133a31b23; 4cfb283e9c6d968dfa7426fd36d6936e8c7b5f5f; 79eb0cf3952f8a259c0835226c6a8a43dd36e6e8; eb3a335c94737e10dba4cdace24f4b7469dc7c00; 30dd45b08710998eaeabb20a3db1d6c88e914078; 10831043c0b38a3d1c6527860dd476e370338f4c; 2bf6c443c95f1f1951e1663c337555b98da17d11; c078fcb447457f853590c4723981792242f4c862; b7c9fae4922122195d143bff2b79423774f240f3; ed6f52a6ab90636f89f757f6caf4491811fe43bf; 8dea569b552927574653e45ce479c8afb1cf1de8; 5a3414c833cd830730ae71c71316ec1f30361f8d; 9660890674ea4c335cee509d44c9333a38ff7b0f,Molecular Pain,15,
fa7bb30808415e0ab7ae6d95cce92f1c7e7a0e15,Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis skin demonstrates distinct molecular subsets separated by a cardiovascular development gene expression signature,"BackgroundSystemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is an uncommon autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by autoimmunity, vasculopathy and fibrosis. Gene expression profiling distinguishes scleroderma from normal skin, and can detect different subsets of disease, with potential to identify prognostic biomarkers of organ involvement or response to therapy. We have performed gene expression profiling in skin samples from patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc).MethodsTotal RNA was extracted from clinically uninvolved skin biopsies of 15 patients with lcSSc and 8 healthy controls (HC). Gene expression profiling was performed on a DNA oligonucleotide microarray chip. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). Functional enrichment analysis of gene signatures was done via g:Profiler.ResultsThere were 218 DEG between lcSSc and HC samples (false discovery rate <10%): 181/218 DEG were upregulated in lcSSc samples. Hierarchical clustering of DEG suggested the presence of two separate groups of lcSSc samples: â€œlimited 1â€ and â€œlimited 2â€. The limited-1 group (13 samples, 10 unique patients) showed upregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion, cardiovascular system (CVS) development, extracellular matrix and immune and inflammatory response. The CVS development signature was of particular interest as its genes showed very strong enrichment in response to wounding, response to transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² and kinase cascade. Neither limited-2 samples (six samples, five unique patients) nor HC samples showed functional enrichment. There were no significant differences in demographic or clinical parameters between these two groups. These results were confirmed using a second independent cohort.ConclusionsOur study suggests the presence of molecular subsets in lcSSc based on gene expression profiling of biopsies from uninvolved skin. This may reflect important differences in pathogenesis within these patient groups. We identify differential expression of a subset of genes that relate to CVS and are enriched in fibrotic signalling. This may shed light on mechanisms of vascular disease in SSc. The enrichment in profibrotic profile suggests that dysregulated gene expression may contribute to vasculopathy and fibrosis in different disease subsets.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emma C.

cfc10be0b05add4ac7dc1b760d66d42ed911ae18,Abstract P5-06-05: miRNAs associated with DNA repair capacity in Puerto Rican women with breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level via binding to 3â€²-untranslated regions of protein-coding transcripts. Some miRNAs have been used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic markers of breast cancer (BC). It is well established that dysregulation of DNA repair capacity (DRC) is an important risk factor of BC. However, there is little published information as to what specific miRNAs are associated with DRC in women with BC. OBJECTIVE : The main objective of this study was to identify candidate miRNAs associated with dysregulation of DRC in women with BC. METHODS: Plasma samples from 30 BC cases and 30 controls selected based on their DRC levels (low, high) using a proprietary algorithm. Samples were analyzed for miRNA expression utilizing protocols from Applied Biosystems (Life Technologies). The miRNA expression profiling was performed utilizing the RT-PCR TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A Cards v 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) containing 383 miRNA probes. Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 200 ng of total RNA in 8 Multiplex RT primer pool reactions containing stem-looped RT primers that were specific to mature miRNAs. U6 snRNA-001973 was selected for normalization based on our own experimental validations. To quantify the association of the miRNA expression the fold change () was estimated for every detector with the p-values calculated using the t-test. RESULTS: Candidate miRNAs that showed a statistically significant expression were: miR-146, miR-34a, miR-221, Let-7b, miR-193b, miR-132, miR-192, miR-21, miR-197, miR-24, miR-26b, miR-29c were identified based on a false discovery rate of 4%. The results showed that twelve miRNAs differentially expressed in patients with BC. Candidate miRNAs have been reported associated with the expression of twenty seven DNA repair genes. Two of these genes are part of the NER pathway which has been identified by previous studies as important in BC. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggests that differential expression of specific miRNAs might be associated with dysregulation of DRC in BC. The molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate DNA repair genes remain to be elucidated. However, our results lend further promise to the concept of miRNAs as a tool to study the regulation of DRC. We see potentialfuture applications in prognosis and therapy of women with BC.

4255e0f12d8aeb968ed6cc33e8a9652a2264eb4b,Lectin microarray analysis of pluripotent and multipotent stem cells.,"Stem cells have a capability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple types of cells; specific markers are available to identify particular stem cells for developmental biology research. In this study, we aimed to define the status of somatic stem cells and the pluripotency of human embryonic stem (hES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using a novel molecular methodology, lectin microarray analysis. Our lectin microarray analysis successfully categorized murine somatic stem cells into the appropriate groups of differentiation potency. We then classified hES and iPS cells by the same approach. Undifferentiated hES cells were clearly distinguished from differentiated hES cells after embryoid formation. The pair-wise comparison means based on 'false discovery rate' revealed that three lectins -Euonymus europaeus lectin (EEL), Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL) and Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin [PHA(L)]- generated maximal values to define undifferentiated and differentiated hES cells. Furthermore, to define a pluripotent stem cell state, we generated a discriminant for the undifferentiated state with pluripotency. The discriminant function based on lectin reactivities was highly accurate for judgment of stem cell pluripotency.

8e666a2fe5a6b47b23b33fbfdb1a0d411b56931d,A Complete Review of Controlling the FDR in a Multiple Comparison Problem Framework -- The Benjamini-Hochberg Algorithm,This paper is a review of the popular Benjamini Hochberg Method and other related useful methods of Multiple Hypothesis testing. This is written with the purpose of serving a short but complete easy to understand review of the main article with proper background. The paper titled 'Controlling the False Discovery Rate-a practical and powerful Approach to multiple Testing' by benjamini et. al.[1] proposes a new framework of controlling the False Discovery Rate in a Multiple Hypothesis testing problem. It has been claimed that the procedure proposed in the paper results in a substantial gain in power more applicable in case of problems which call for False discovery rate (FDR) control rather than Familywise Error Rate (FWER). The proposed method uses a simple Bonferroni type procedure for FDR control.,2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Anish Acharya"", ids = ""40026200"")",524374f73be29e5b8c71188ce6a3b8a3ef0faff9,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,arXiv: Methodology,,
99836daa33af976d71d46c51198c7226420ed413,Association between Variants in Atopy-Related Immunologic Candidate Genes and Pancreatic Cancer Risk,"BACKGROUND
Many epidemiology studies report that atopic conditions such as allergies are associated with reduced pancreas cancer risk. The reason for this relationship is not yet understood. This is the first study to comprehensively evaluate the association between variants in atopy-related candidate genes and pancreatic cancer risk.


METHODS
A population-based case-control study of pancreas cancer cases diagnosed during 2011-2012 (via Ontario Cancer Registry), and controls recruited using random digit dialing utilized DNA from 179 cases and 566 controls. Following an exhaustive literature review, SNPs in 180 candidate genes were pre-screened using dbGaP pancreas cancer GWAS data; 147 SNPs in 56 allergy-related immunologic genes were retained and genotyped. Logistic regression was used to estimate age-adjusted odd ratio (AOR) for each variant and false discovery rate was used to adjust Wald p-values for multiple testing. Subsequently, a risk allele score was derived based on statistically significant variants.


RESULTS
18 SNPs in 14 candidate genes (CSF2, DENND1B, DPP10, FLG, IL13, IL13RA2, LRP1B, NOD1, NPSR1, ORMDL3, RORA, STAT4, TLR6, TRA) were significantly associated with pancreas cancer risk. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, two LRP1B SNPs remained statistically significant; for example, LRP1B rs1449477 (AA vs. CC: AOR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.22-0.62; p (adjusted)=0.04). Furthermore, the risk allele score was associated with a significant reduction in pancreas cancer risk (p=0.0007).


CONCLUSIONS
Preliminary findings suggest certain atopy-related variants may be associated with pancreas cancer risk. Further studies are needed to replicate this, and to elucidate the biology behind the growing body of epidemiologic evidence suggesting allergies may reduce pancreatic cancer risk.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Michelle.

e7f6d0a65136c65bce531e1b572e95db981f0a89,Reproducibility of biomarker identifications from mass spectrometry proteomic data in cancer studies,"Abstract Reproducibility of disease signatures and clinical biomarkers in multi-omics disease analysis has been a key challenge due to a multitude of factors. The heterogeneity of the limited sample, various biological factors such as environmental confounders, and the inherent experimental and technical noises, compounded with the inadequacy of statistical tools, can lead to the misinterpretation of results, and subsequently very different biology. In this paper, we investigate the biomarker reproducibility issues, potentially caused by differences of statistical methods with varied distribution assumptions or marker selection criteria using Mass Spectrometry proteomic ovarian tumor data. We examine the relationship between effect sizes, p values, Cauchy p values, False Discovery Rate p values, and the rank fractions of identified proteins out of thousands in the limited heterogeneous sample. We compared the markers identified from statistical single features selection approaches with machine learning wrapper methods. The results reveal marked differences when selecting the protein markers from varied methods with potential selection biases and false discoveries, which may be due to the small effects, different distribution assumptions, and p value type criteria versus prediction accuracies.

116979aa096d2ced9e4da861f7c6da1d52fc25e3,Mapping similarities in mTOR pathway perturbations in mouse lupus nephritis models and human lupus nephritis,"IntroductionTreatment with sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has been shown to be efficacious in the MRL/lpr and NZB Ã— NZW F1 mouse models of lupus nephritis, indicating a critical role for the mTOR pathway in both models. This type of demonstration of efficacy in animal models is usually a pre-requisite for advancement into clinical development. However, efficacy in an animal model often has not translated to the desired activity in the clinic. Therefore, a more profound understanding of the mechanistic similarities and differences between various animal models and human diseases is highly desirable.MethodsTranscriptional profiling was performed on kidneys from mice with lupus nephritis; from mice who had efficacious drug treatment; and from mice before they developed nephritis. Analysis of variance with false discovery rate adjusted to p < 0.05 and an average fold change of two or more was used to identify transcripts significantly associated with disease and response to therapy. Pathway analyses (using various bioinformatics tools) were carried out to understand the basis for drug efficacy in the mouse model. The relevance in human lupus of the pathways identified in the mouse model was explored using information from several databases derived from the published literature.ResultsWe identified a set of nephritis-associated genes in mouse kidney. Expression of the majority of these returned to asymptomatic levels on sirolimus treatment, confirming the correlation between expression levels and symptoms of nephritis. Network analysis showed that many of these nephritis genes are known to interact with the mTOR pathway. This led us to ask what human diseases are linked to the mTOR pathway. We constructed the mTOR pathway interactome consisting of proteins that interact with members of the mTOR pathway and identified a strong association between mTOR pathway genes and genes reported in the literature as being involved in human lupus.ConclusionsOur findings implicate the mTOR pathway as a critical contributor to human lupus. This broad pathway-based approach to understanding the similarities in, and differences between, animal models and human diseases may have broader utility.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Padmalatha S.

Despite the negative impact of obesity on clinical outcome, the molecular mechanisms by which excess adiposity influences breast cancer are not well-understood. Methods: Affymetrix U133 2.0 gene expression data was available for 405 primary breast tumors and 20 tumor-adjacent adipose tissues; RNA was isolated from tumor epithelia or adipose using laser microdissection. Patients were classified as lean (BMI 30). Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA using Partek Genomics Suite version 6.6. Results: Obese patients were significantly more likely to be diagnosed >50 years and to be of African American ancestry compared to lean or overweight women, while pathological characteristics including tumor stage, size or grade, lymph node status and intrinsic subtype did not differ significantly between groups. Principal component analysis could not effectively cluster the tumors by weight and no genes were differentially expressed using a false discovery rate Conclusions: Although tumor epithelial cells from obese women do not differ significantly from those of lean and/or overweight women at the gene expression level, tumor-adjacent adipose did differ by weight. These data demonstrate that less favorable outcomes in obese patients are not be attributable to the tumor itself but to influences from the microenvironment and suggest that decreasing breast adiposity may be an effective strategy to reducing risk and improving outcomes in obese women.

fbd6fc63cf43047876faec59f6121cc0c68aaf22,An alternative approach to multiple testing for methylation QTL mapping reduces the proportion of falsely identified CpGs,"INTRODUCTION
An increasing number of studies investigates the influence of local genetic variation on DNA methylation levels, so-called in cis methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs). A common multiple testing approach in genome-wide cis meQTL studies limits the false discovery rate (FDR) among all CpG-SNP pairs to 0.05 and reports on CpGs from the significant CpG-SNP pairs. However, a statistical test for each CpG is not performed, potentially increasing the proportion of CpGs falsely reported on. Here, we presented an alternative approach that properly control for multiple testing at the CpG level.


RESULTS
We performed cis meQTL mapping for varying window sizes using publicly available single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 450 kb data, extracting the CpGs from the significant CpG-SNP pairs ([Formula: see text]). Using a new bait-and-switch simulation approach, we show that up to 50% of the CpGs found in the simulated data may be false-positive results. We present an alternative two-step multiple testing approach using the Simes and Benjamini-Hochberg procedures that does control the FDR among the CpGs, as confirmed by the bait-and-switch simulation. This approach indicates the use of window sizes in cis meQTL mapping studies that are significantly smaller than commonly adopted.


DISCUSSION
Our approach to cis meQTL mapping properly controls the FDR at the CpG level, is computationally fast and can also be applied to cis eQTL studies.

bcc2db5d229cc04d6452e7a101687384de4a6b9c,More on the inadmissibility of step-up,"Cohen and Sackrowitz [Characterization of Bayes procedures for multiple endpoint problems and inadmissibility of the step-up procedure, Ann. Statist. 33 (2005) 145-158] proved that the step-up multiple testing procedure is inadmissible for a multivariate normal model with unknown mean vector and known intraclass covariance matrix. The hypotheses tested are each mean is zero vs. each mean is positive. The risk function is a 2x1 vector where one component is average size and the other component is one minus average power. In this paper, we extend the inadmissibility result to several different models, to two-sided alternatives, and to other risk functions. The models include one-parameter exponential families, independent t-variables, independent @g^2-variables, t-tests arising from the analysis of variance, and t-tests arising from testing treatments against a control. The additional risk functions are linear combinations where one component is the false discovery rate (FDR).",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Arthur Cohen"", ids = ""143698811""); list(name = ""Harold Sackrowitz"", ids = ""2549916"")",0043a30db212b3b4c1b8821e11f86ed28b7655fa; fb198d4d563d2c7d5aafb30ca7ab40b40801abfa; 90e7599133e0ac18cae9a721bf1227b4661ab949; 7d1f769cd7eb29381a910a793e1343c2aeb2b0e5; b23f2d0f9f32a957740080d8f793feb69c8fa89d; 06871ab21bd4ec2c36be0962873e15b3298fa86f,,Journal of Multivariate Analysis,98,481-492
c697a40efa3355344ffa377c2ad23e219772804b,Use of the Local False Discovery Rate for Identification of Metabolic Biomarkers in Rat Urine Following Genkwa Flos-Induced Hepatotoxicity,"Metabolomics is concerned with characterizing the large number of metabolites present in a biological system using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and HPLC/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry). Multivariate analysis is one of the most important tools for metabolic biomarker identification in metabolomic studies. However, analyzing the large-scale data sets acquired during metabolic fingerprinting is a major challenge. As a posterior probability that the features of interest are not affected, the local false discovery rate (LFDR) is a good interpretable measure. However, it is rarely used to when interrogating metabolic data to identify biomarkers. In this study, we employed the LFDR method to analyze HPLC/MS data acquired from a metabolomic study of metabolic changes in rat urine during hepatotoxicity induced by Genkwa flos (GF) treatment. The LFDR approach was successfully used to identify important rat urine metabolites altered by GF-stimulated hepatotoxicity. Compared with principle component analysis (PCA), LFDR is an interpretable measure and discovers more important metabolites in an HPLC/MS-based metabolomic study.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zuojing Li"", ids = ""7718693""); list(name = ""Qing Li"", ids = ""144381593""); list(name = ""Lulu Geng"", ids = ""4287585""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Chen"", ids = ""144678976""); list(name = ""Kaishun Bi"", ids = ""144105177"")",14acb4d40af36210df430c79c327a139141b4d2e; f5ffad77bfbab80afc1bb3b79fa9b365f7267b8e; 4d5fe545896b85563a2aa605c8222165498a4e93; 70700ae6fc27d366132b6faded7ea666a017f4e3; 026016ee395e8a9a75fa7dfa6ef02c2bf4a719ce; ecc22bcebe796b75b9de3634ee6a35b0b46a9e3d; d1700880690f86d5cbdf503de4ee45de7c5b8974; 1885ed023b0131ea1663765ee8fbae0336954583,36b40e07dbd0fd44e16328154469011b8c1f8b0f; 36775392379fa492169bd73c8b25d6b00914cb76; 06d8ee888fdb59d0784931f329d3d1c1ac06a41a; 7c14001e51869d176924a203aa9300882e2fd4ca; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; a4adbb16da06430419638c6dab28318386582461; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 67fcea98aef721b278c7bed6ed1b39bec3f6b3aa; 8160badbd3ce8fcd6fc3a47e2e49e745d4758a79; 0c8b3c97f7c38a1776db7578df1da8e0ff0ae5de; 35362b7d19d5c89e281e299d3483cde1d763ca96; 33d9f1651a591f9512668095bcaad93256c5c43a; 07da7069afcf1e1ef15274fe00e6649f2e9fb5d0; 4bd46647b4dd58e8ea0878f6074b89ef63eba2d0; 33fb60d1d4a002f5d7573a52f42dc85545ee2316; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c7e396c2e94f70cd66cd726a1e9a5c4dd4516e12; 136f2dd40ad678d4681679383f5eb5b1212cf344; c6e19e5b3b429f64a4fbb6e08fc0b1185706f448; 71a191ea7138f1ead20122236c83caa986028b96; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 7db9d93ff067645ae2f2c0392da6851b348c605d; ef5d1e17dacda1d99e7827412e70d39fcff9829d,PLoS ONE,8,
3f79c75bfdfe72d593308783554378c0de130230,Ventral posterior substantia nigra iron increases over 3 years in Parkinson's disease.,"BACKGROUND
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized in part by the progressive accumulation of iron within the substantia nigra (SN); however, its spatial and temporal dynamics remain relatively poorly understood.


OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to investigate spatial patterns and temporal evolution of SN iron accumulation in PD.


METHODS
A total of 18 PD patients (mean disease duration = 6.2 years) receiving dopaminergic therapy and 16 healthy controls were scanned with 3T MRI at baseline and 3 years later using quantitative susceptibility mapping, an indirect marker of iron content. Iron was assessed separately in the posterior SN and anterior SN at the ventral and dorsal levels of the SN. The results were corrected for the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
A significant group effect was found for the ventral posterior SN (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001) and anterior SN (P = .042) quantitative susceptibility mapping as well as significant group x time interaction effects (P = .02 and P = .043, respectively). In addition, a significant intragroup change during 3 years of follow-up was found only in the ventral posterior SN of PD (P = .012), but not healthy controls. No significant effects were detected for any dorsal SN measures. No associations were identified with clinical measures.


CONCLUSIONS
We found both cross-sectional and longitudinal SN iron changes to be confined to its more ventral location in PD. Because pathology studies also show the ventral SN to degenerate early and to the greatest extent in PD, the assessment of iron levels by quantitative susceptibility mapping in this area may potentially represent a disease progression biomarker in PD.

9e4b1b0275988ba837f24b415a627a4f4348defe,289 Applications of protein microarray for saliva diagnostics in autoimmune diseases,"Background and aims Many reports suggest that saliva could be a source of biomarkers capable of detecting certain diseases. However, very few studies conducted to profile autoantibody isotypes in the saliva of autoimmune diseases.This study was performed to establish protein microarray for saliva diagnostics and to identify distinct profiles of salivary autoantibody in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods We constructed antigen microarrays with canonical antigens of SLE as well as cytokines to characterise autoantibodies in matched saliva and serum derived from 17 SLE patients and 13 healthy controls. The autoantibody IgG and IgA isotypes were assayed.The Axon Scanner and GenePix Pro 7.0 were used to determine median fluorescence intensities (MFI) of features and background. Data were analysed using MultiExperiment Viewer and Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) algorithm. Results The dynamic range of detection on the array was 1â€“10 4 â€‰ng/mL for commercial Abs spiked into saliva. We observed a high degree of specificity for its target antigen. IgG Ab reactivity against specific antigens was found mainly in serum, while IgA Ab reactivity to given antigens was predominant in saliva. SAM identified 7 antigens including BAFF, Ro60, U1-A and Sm/RNP that were significantly more reactive to IgA Ab in the saliva of SLE patients than in healthy controls (false discovery rate Conclusions Protein microarrays facilitate detection of autoantibody in human saliva as well as serum. Saliva profiling revealed that elevated IgA autoantibody reactivity to several targets including BAFF was associated with SLE compared with controls.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Y. F.

We tested the hypothesis that differences in tumor biology contribute to this survival health disparity. Using microarray technology, we obtained gene expression profiles of primary prostate tumors resected from 33 African-American and 36 European-American patients. These tumors were matched on clinical parameters. We also evaluated 18 non-tumor prostate tissues from 7 African-American and 11 European-American patients. The resulting datasets were analyzed for expression differences on the gene and pathway level comparing African-American with European-American patients. Our analysis revealed 162 transcripts to be differentially expressed between African-American and European-American prostate cancer patients at a false discovery rate of 5% or less. Using a disease association analysis, we identified a common relationship of these transcripts with autoimmunity and inflammation. These findings were corroborated on the pathway level with numerous differentially expressed genes clustering in immune response, defense response, antigen presentation, B-cell/T-cell function, cytokine signaling, and inflammatory response pathways. Most commonly, the genes involved in these pathways were more highly expressed in tumors of African-American patients when compared with those of European-American patients. Amongst the immune-specific genes over-expressed by African-American patients was indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenease, HLA-E, and HLA-G. All three of these genes are well-known contributors of immunologic tolerance in tumors. Furthermore, a distinctive interferon signature was identified in the African-American prostate tumors, suggesting the possibility of viral involvement in disease etiology in this African-American population. In conclusion, the gene expression profiles of prostate tumors indicate prominent differences in tumor immunobiology between African-American and European-American men. The profiles portray the existence of a distinct tumor microenvironment in these two patient groups.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tiffany A. Wallace"", ids = ""48546087""); list(name = ""Robyn L.

Currently, there are no predictive biomarkers of PN. Pharmacometabolomics is an informative tool for biomarker discovery of drug toxicity. We conducted a secondary whole blood pharmacometabolomics analysis to assess the association between pretreatment metabolome, early treatment-induced metabolic changes, and the development of PN.MethodsWhole blood samples were collected pre-treatment (BL), just before the end of the first paclitaxel infusion (EOI), and 24 h after the first infusion (24H) from sixty patients with breast cancer receiving (80Â mg/m2) weekly treatment. Neuropathy was assessed at BL and prior to each infusion using the sensory subscale (CIPN8) of the EORTC CIPN20 questionnaire. Blood metabolites were quantified from 1-D-1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra using ChenomxÂ® software. Metabolite concentrations were normalized in preparation for Pearson correlation and one-way repeated measures ANOVA with multiple comparisons corrected by false discovery rate (FDR).ResultsPretreatment histidine, phenylalanine, and threonine concentrations were inversely associated with maximum change in CIPN8 (Î”CIPN8) (pâ€‰<â€‰0.02; FDRâ€‰â‰¤â€‰25%). Paclitaxel caused a significant change in concentrations of 2-hydroxybutyrate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate, o-acetylcarnitine, and several amino acids from BL to EOI and/or 24H (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05; FDRâ€‰â‰¤â€‰25%), although these changes were not associated with Î”CIPN8.ConclusionsWhole blood metabolomics is a feasible approach to identify potential biomarker candidates of paclitaxel-induced PN. The findings suggest that pretreatment concentrations of histidine, phenylalanine, and threonine may be predictive of the severity of future PN and paclitaxel-induced metabolic changes may be related to disruption of energy homeostasis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yihan Sun"", ids = ""46675275""); list(name = ""Jae Hyun Kim"", ids = ""34017702""); list(name = ""Kiran Vangipuram"", ids = ""40998002""); list(name = ""Daniel F Hayes"", ids = ""2364848""); list(name = ""Ellen M Lavoie Smith"", ids = ""34969836""); list(name = ""Larisa Yeomans"", ids = ""5202292""); list(name = ""N Lynn Henry"", ids = ""2454023""); list(name = ""Kathleen A.

Nineteen human breast cancer cell lines were tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel (T), 5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in vitro. Baseline gene expression data were obtained for each cell line with Affymetrix U133A gene chips, and multigene predictors of sensitivity were derived for each drug separately. These predictors were applied individually and in combination to human gene expression data generated with the same Affymetrix platform from fine needle aspiration specimens of 133 stage I-III breast cancers. Tumor samples were obtained at baseline, and each patient received 6Â months of preoperative TFAC chemotherapy followed by surgery. Cell line-derived prediction results were correlated with the observed pathologic response to chemotherapy. Statistically robust differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells could only be found for paclitaxel. False discovery rates associated with the informative genes were high for all other drugs. For each drug, the top 100 differentially expressed genes were combined into a drug-specific response predictor. When these cell line-based predictors were applied to patient data, there was no significant correlation between observed response and predicted response either for individual drug predictors or combined predictions.

aa2d2741b3559848378d2b7f76342a1c02232a21,ADTU-05â€…Gut microbial composition in the migrant south-asian IBD population in UK,"Introduction Epidemiological studies have highlighted that the South Asian migrant population in UK have a comparable risk of developing IBD but with a more aggressive phenotype than the white Caucasian population. It remains unclear if this is due to environmental/lifestyle factors or differences in host genetics. The human gut microbiota is impacted by health status and diet and therefore represents a potentially adaptive phenotype that is influenced by the environment. As the gut microbiota has been shown to be different in the native South Asian population compared to those in developed countries, we aimed to investigate if there were ethnic differences in the microbiota in IBD patients. Methods Stool samples were collected from South Asian (n=20) and Caucasian patients (n=46) with IBD attending outpatient clinics at University Hospital Birmingham along with healthy controls (n=17). DNA was extracted and the V4 hyper-variable region of the 16S rRNA gene amplified and sequenced. Analysis was performed on the QIIME pipeline using the GreenGenes database. Diversity analysis was corrected for false discovery rates. Result Patients with IBD had a significantly different gut microbial composition in comparison to healthy controls as expected (p=0.01). Gut microbial diversity was reduced in IBD (p=0.001). A significant decrease in Firmicutes phylum was observed in patients with IBD in comparison to healthy controls which was primarily due a reduced abundance of communities from genus Faecalibacterium praunitizii, Lachnospiracae, Ruminococcus and Blautia (p<0.002). Within the IBD cohort, the alpha or beta diversity of gut microbiota was very similar for South Asians and Caucasian patients. No significant differences were seen at any taxonomic levels. Published literature have previously demonstrated that the gut microbiota in healthy South Asians living in the subcontinent was enriched with populations of Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, and Bifidobacterium bacteria. In our South Asian IBD cohort these microbial communities were significantly reduced. Conclusion This is the first study to date investigating the gut microbial composition in the migrant population with IBD in UK. The gut microbiota in South Asian IBD patients is similar to Caucasian IBD patients living in UK. Our findings suggest the need to explore further the role environmental factors in the development of IBD associated dysbiosis but also the role of host factors in pathogenesis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohammed Nabil Quraishi"", ids = ""145417647""); list(name = ""Animesh Acharjee"", ids = ""12007318""); list(name = ""Neeraj Bhala"", ids = ""3644262""); list(name = ""Shrikanth Pathmakanthan"", ids = ""50041055""); list(name = ""Rachel Cooney"", ids = ""144678252""); list(name = ""Subrata Ghosh"", ids = ""144684548""); list(name = ""Georgios V.

37f7241e5e25144dd602950fb23c2494a98bf0b9,Structurally differentiated cis-elements that interact with PU.1 are functionally distinguishable in acute promyelocytic leukemia,"BackgroundTranscription factor PU.1, a member of the ETS family, is a master regulator of myeloid differentiation whose functional disruption is often associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although much has been learned about PU.1 over the past decades, relatively little is known about cis-elements that interact with this factor under physiological or pathological conditions, especially in the whole-genome scale. We aimed to define the cistrome of PU.1 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells and characterize the cis-elements bound by PU.1.MethodsChromatin immunoprecipitation with specific antibody coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to investigate the in vivo PU.1 binding sites at the whole-genome scale in APL-derived NB4 cells. The ChIP-quantitative (q)-PCR and luciferase reporter assays were used to validate the binding events and trans-activity, respectively. Various computational analyses, including motif mining, evolutionary conservation analysis and functional enrichment analysis, were performed to characterize the cis-elements that interacted with PU.1.ResultsA total of 26,907 significantly enriched binding regions of PU.1 were identified under the false discovery rate 0.1% in NB4 cells. PU.1 bound to various types of genomic regions and acted as a promoter-enhancer dual binding transcription factor. Based on the sequence length and composition, two types of representative motifs were identified in PU.1 binding sites: a long and a short motif. The long motif, characterized by high sequence specificity and binding affinity, predominantly resided in the promoter-distal regions. In contrast, the short one, with strong evolutionary constraint, represented the primary PU.1 cis-elements in the promoter-proximal regions. Interestingly, the short one showed more preference to be correlated with the binding of other factors, especially PML/RARÎ±. Moreover, genes targeted by both PU.1 and PML/RARÎ± were significantly involved in categories associated with oncogenesis, hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that structurally differentiated cis-elements that interact with PU.1 are functionally distinguishable in APL, suggesting that the sequence diversity of cis-elements might be a critical mechanism by which cells interpret the genome, and contribute to distinct physiological and/or pathological function.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maoxiang Qian"", ids = ""33807798""); list(name = ""Wen Jin"", ids = ""1764187""); list(name = ""Xuehua Zhu"", ids = ""6295232""); list(name = ""Xiaohong Jia"", ids = ""16072687""); list(name = ""Xianwen Yang"", ids = ""47008334""); list(name = ""Yanzhi Du"", ids = ""4327477""); list(name = ""Kankan Wang"", ids = ""2622587""); list(name = ""Ji Zhang"", ids = ""47539564"")",1e97d0f6a52df9a695019572ddb44f72f7210736; 4326a61b4c3c8a617a73fbffff85d5ee28039e09; 84e86eda918a9e74fd8fc3c32df93bf48462952b; 4b30be6ef0b53857c2f59e695049ff2ca5d49a42; 2a766fd18f52c57d53a0fa2dac67e7d8eb41d4a3; b9edeea8dd72651f1d475f181e37e26454889be4; 5187ad974f0e501d71dee838dcdb39013f552feb; 5e70abedfbddb2826c40b95d6ec0e9667e851679; be8cc390cfe0fd91d20fb9b59d74064d3aabaf4e,237bb1cc091d589ffe0d3196623da54558e90399; 923cf419d49ccd071f20125c5ad687a4e79cfa9d; 5a536793636a1822df239250c8a82645d582010b; ec620dfa56d45ce0cec9c7cfb0a3e29b2e2686d1; c06de703fdc8e51e933a9cd17d40ddb8533bcc2f; 1fcf323ff79c46b401e7a3d8510f50da17073cb8; a2e5cb4898ff903d425f096ecf9a82074a855c9b; f863b0bc0f742565dd93f9549d62faab4927ec5a; 41641e7de497d92fc7984209f4fbec31057861bc; 090c90facc72bdd45e0392ab67b222fc8fcd81f5; 42abddd227d653a0375d7d037ddb885f6c07f66f; bc7171cb905c39c4db07049d9fea784292dedac8; 3316bdc5cea1af09f6d1b3969e3811358f252510; 422cef7d84da816a64adb29d85d7cd01a9c941f8; 9c6bf5157ad2fb538089de9fc9c3c453025d4d17; 54f4ef17f6b7a315260e001af85fc8b6fc1d2a7b; d8fbf1a25c4bcc298df53f5da1d3f088e9d305ce; 9193823e0936e911ad099d84dd4fc23d0fa01c47; dd20de37d7d70dde0a5424275ab76d9e8ee6d01e; 5afb9e08edd6521c0fdecd7e9100a97d59349ee6; 35d5c9c20843a8c5e7b9819039efa544156daea0; 8d100be666c282fa3a813af682729ea0d2770784; 493fe2324ceb201b13b6bc5d7a8fbbfb35bb17fa; 5ee4c953071c51fc44cbad947702c0d892bb956d; c3a231861abd49ed69f93bfeaff7182ba2a751de; f724666bb3a2013dd03068ef97f6d8d76f12a6b0; 1915d5dc782c65ab0666b9a9d805fd810080de57; 87d8d2d8e2560f3d58f965d0081518a94a47c0ed; cf6ee0915ca3b4a6615e0f98199c8bb9150de213; fa8091a73d9ee51fd67e8621da50c10ddeaba2bd; ea19872ecc3e8e4768ce922544ad775cffd79855; 20e2a4c2597cdae6507d756109c0ae7b9f6a0d78; 8ba976f0b2b563d0b89fddf6ea983dec112ef020; 64d83db7ad81dafcb2cd7a1eb5539bab834e02dd; f9e5f40ee5b34742f42ccf7ff695776be628126c; 67bfd7ce2751cfc14088140c680ace954453e708; 78f57af1ccb15852b3be2453f84b9864d0386e53; f804dfb886b1424571f0446df10074af63c57921; d2f6fd5a3d21bad39e2bc1d7900cde3c35e1485e; 81cc62e3a81da8244f771f1fe73b817025a90d97; 556d6f9a2d19fc82cfda040fe78a03bac764be81; 073acc2ecf7682d1c024ba318fa1859dfa4488c2; e4f55471ff03a276f417ad96412cefe4755736a0; 699f57ebe5d8a79d25adb0f01b349f5a876d3e67; 773187d201d776df58a38117a02bc6f426aadf54; f1846682fef3edbc9192fdd3a3dc0fe4b1c3c2ba,Journal of Hematology & Oncology,6,25 - 25
c308ddf159df6aa86f7fe3069cf297f40ef417dc,The utility of porous graphitic carbon as a stationary phase in proteomics workflows: two-dimensional chromatography of complex peptide samples.,"We present the first investigation into the utility of porous graphitic carbon (PGC) as a stationary phase in proteomic workflows involving complex samples. PGC offers chemical and physical robustness and is capable of withstanding extremes of pH and higher temperatures than traditional stationary phases, without the likelihood of catastrophic failure. In addition, unlike separations driven by ion exchange mechanisms, there is no requirement for high levels of non-volatile salts such as potassium chloride in the elution buffers, which must be removed prior to LC-MS analysis. Here we present data which demonstrate that PGC affords excellent peptide separation in a complex whole cell lysate digest sample, with good orthogonality to a typical low pH reversed-phase system. As strong cation exchange (SCX) is currently the most popular first dimension for 2D peptide separations, we chose to compare the performance of a PGC and SCX separation as the first dimension in a comprehensive 2D-LC-MS/MS workflow. A significant increase, in the region of 40%, in peptide identifications is reported with off-line PGC fractionation compared to SCX. Around 14,000 unique peptides were identified at an estimated false discovery rate of 1% (n=3 replicates) from starting material constituting only 100 Î¼g of protein extract.",2012,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""John.

Candidate genes in inflammation, thrombosis, coagulation, and lipid metabolism pathways have been implicated in venous thromboembolism (VTE).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Using DNA samples collected at baseline in the Physicians' Health Study cohort, we genotyped 92 polymorphisms from 56 candidate genes among 304 individuals who subsequently developed VTE (144 idiopathic, 156 secondary cases) and among 2070 individuals who remained free of reported vascular disease over a mean follow-up of 13.2 years to prospectively determine whether these gene polymorphisms contribute to the risk of VTE. For idiopathic VTE, in addition to the factor V (Leiden) mutation (odds ratio [OR], 5.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.24 to 8.14; P<0.0001; false discovery rate [FDR], P<0.0001), an N291S lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphism (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.56 to 6.09; P=0.001; FDR, P=0.036) and a Q27E beta2-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphism (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.79; P=0.006; FDR, P=0.036) were found to be significantly associated with increased risk. For secondary VTE, a Q360H apolipoprotein A4 gene polymorphism (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.65; P=0.001; FDR, P=0.07) and an I50V interleukin-4 receptor polymorphism (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84; P=0.0009; FDR, P=0.07) were moderately, but not statistically and significantly, associated with reduced risk after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

8ee4d2ac0affe95a3ba599fdd0fbee82dbb34040,Gene expression profiling in the striatum of inbred mouse strains with distinct opioid-related phenotypes,"BackgroundMouse strains with a contrasting response to morphine provide a unique model for studying the genetically determined diversity of sensitivity to opioid reward, tolerance and dependence. Four inbred strains selected for this study exhibit the most distinct opioid-related phenotypes. C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice show remarkable differences in morphine-induced antinociception, self-administration and locomotor activity. 129P3/J mice display low morphine tolerance and dependence in contrast to high sensitivity to precipitated withdrawal observed in SWR/J and C57BL/6J strains. In this study, we attempted to investigate the relationships between genetic background and basal gene expression profile in the striatum, a brain region involved in the mechanism of opioid action.ResultsGene expression was studied by Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430v2.0 arrays with probes for over 39.000 transcripts. Analysis of variance with the control for false discovery rate (q < 0.01) revealed inter-strain variation in the expression of ~3% of the analyzed transcripts. A combination of three methods of array pre-processing was used to compile a list of ranked transcripts covered by 1528 probe-sets significantly different between the mouse strains under comparison. Using Gene Ontology analysis, over-represented patterns of genes associated with cytoskeleton and involved in synaptic transmission were identified. Differential expression of several genes with relevant neurobiological function (e.g. GABA-A receptor alpha subunits) was validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Analysis of correlations between gene expression and behavioural data revealed connection between the level of mRNA for K homology domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 (Khdrbs1) and ATPase Na+/K+ alpha2 subunit (Atp1a2) with morphine self-administration and analgesic effects, respectively. Finally, the examination of transcript structure demonstrated a possible inter-strain variability of expressed mRNA forms as for example the catechol-O-methyltransferase (Comt) gene.ConclusionThe presented study led to the recognition of differences in the gene expression that may account for distinct phenotypes. Moreover, results indicate strong contribution of genetic background to differences in gene transcription in the mouse striatum.

1df942f30037ad895ba0ccf1912f1515a151400d,Marginal vitamin B-6 deficiency decreases plasma (n-3) and (n-6) PUFA concentrations in healthy men and women.,"Previous animal studies showed that severe vitamin B-6 deficiency altered fatty acid profiles of tissue lipids, often with an increase of linoleic acid and a decrease of arachidonic acid. However, little is known about the extent to which vitamin B-6 deficiency affects human fatty acid profiles. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of marginal vitamin B-6 deficiency on fatty acid profiles in plasma, erythrocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy adults fed a 28-d, low-vitamin B-6 diet. Healthy participants (n = 23) received a 2-d, controlled, vitamin B-6-adequate diet followed by a 28-d, vitamin B-6-restricted diet to induce a marginal deficiency. Plasma HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations, FFA concentrations, and erythrocyte and PBMC membrane fatty acid compositions did not significantly change from baseline after the 28-d restriction. Plasma total arachidonic acid, EPA, and DHA concentrations decreased from (mean Â± SD) 548 Â± 96 to 490 Â± 94 Î¼mol/L, 37 Â± 13 to 32 Â± 13 Î¼mol/L, and 121 Â± 28 to 109 Â± 28 Î¼mol/L [positive false discovery rate (pFDR) adjusted P < 0.05], respectively. The total (n-6):(n-3) PUFA ratio in plasma exhibited a minor increase from 15.4 Â± 2.8 to 16.6 Â± 3.1 (pFDR adjusted P < 0.05). These data indicate that short-term vitamin B-6 restriction decreases plasma (n-3) and (n-6) PUFA concentrations and tends to increase the plasma (n-6):(n-3) PUFA ratio. Such changes in blood lipids may be associated with the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in vitamin B-6 insufficiency.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mei Zhao"", ids = ""2225611""); list(name = ""Yvonne Lamers"", ids = ""3856677""); list(name = ""Maria A Ralat"", ids = ""11829818""); list(name = ""Bonnie S.

e9098f0920ebb93c8b5f71de58628b9b9089f6f6,Transcriptome analysis of grain-filling caryopses reveals the potential formation mechanism of the rice sugary mutant.,"A sugary mutant with low total starch and high sugar contents was compared with its wild type Sindongjin for grain-filling caryopses. In the present study, developing seeds of Sindongjin and sugary mutant from the 11th day after flowering (DAF) were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). A total of 30,385 and 32,243 genes were identified in Sindongjin and sugary mutant. Transcriptomic change analysis showed that 7713 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (logâ‚‚ fold change â‰¥1, false discovery rate (FDR)â‰¤0.001) were identified based on our RNA-Seq data, with 7239 genes up-regulated and 474 down-regulated in the sugary mutant. A large number of DEGs were found related to metabolic, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction and starch/sugar metabolism. Detailed pathway dissection and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that most genes involved in sucrose to starch synthesis are up-regulated, whereas the expression of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase small subunit (OsAGPS2b) catalyzing the first committed step of starch biosynthesis was specifically inhibited during the grain-filling stage in sugary mutant. Further analysis suggested that the OsAGPS2b is a considerable candidate gene responsible for phenotype of sugary mutant.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Feng-peng Li"", ids = ""46494153""); list(name = ""Minyoung Yoon"", ids = ""84623199""); list(name = ""Gang Li"", ids = ""49461165""); list(name = ""Won-Hee Ra"", ids = ""7926610""); list(name = ""Jae-Wan Park"", ids = ""48491157""); list(name = ""Soon-Jae Kwon"", ids = ""50618287""); list(name = ""Soon-Wook Kwon"", ids = ""5267785""); list(name = ""Ilpyung Ahn"", ids = ""4272885""); list(name = ""Yong-Jin Park"", ids = ""144232418"")",b5a28e318a90689ba567ddbffd1f07eaa56be124; c1f11ea99e4ded70401b26dfd233276e464f5db2; 2532702ac1c1433b6095591d4a877e2498b947be; 96cfef01cb6bebca51675194665996f6f2fddf04,,Gene,546 2,"

a2722380c9e0f6e50f3d762e8e871dab57298bf2,Genomic prediction reveals significant non-additive effects for growth in hybrid Eucalyptus,"The application of quantitative genetics in plant and animal breeding has largely focused on additive models to estimate breeding values. The availability of dense panels of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) have made it possible to estimate the realized genomic relationship which in turn allows partitioning the genetic variance into additive and non-additive components and the prediction of the total genetic value of individuals. We used and compared a systematic series of genomic prediction models accounting for additive, dominance, and first-order epistatic interactions (additive by additive, dominance by dominance, and additive by dominance), considering either pedigree- or genomic-based information for growth traits, wood basic density and pulp yield in a hybrid population of Eucalyptus urophylla Ã— E.grandis. We showed that, compared to pedigree-derived information, the use of a realized genomic-based relationship matrix yields a substantially more precise separation of additive and non-additive components of genetic variance. In addition, phenotypic prediction accuracies were increased by including dominance effects for growth traits due to the large contribution of non-additive effects. This novel result improves our current understanding of the architecture of quantitative traits and recommends accounting for dominance variance when developing genomic selection strategies in hybrid Eucalyptus.

001663aff113db1b979dd8051f55985e5adaee80,Investigating the Role of Fetal Gene Expression in Preterm Birth,"Second-trimester amniotic fluid supernatant (AFS) contains cell-free fetal RNA (cffRNA) transcripts that can provide information about fetal gene expression. In a retrospective caseâ€“control study, we measured second-trimester fetal gene expression using cffRNA extracted from AFS in women who had spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) <34 weeks and in women who delivered >37 weeks. We extracted cffRNA from AFS of women with singletons who had second-trimester genetic amniocenteses. Twenty-one gravidas who had sPTB and 21 term controls were matched 1:1 for maternal age, fetal sex, race, gestational age (GA) at the time of amniocentesis, and medication exposure. Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted and hybridized to a customized 65-gene NanoString panel containing genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal (HPA) axis and included 15 housekeeping genes. Two models were run, 1 examining sPTB in relation to case/control status and 1 examining sPTB in relation to GA as a continuous variable. Among cases, the gene expression of nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), d-aspartate oxidase (DDO), and Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was higher than controls (P value < .05; false discovery rateâ€“corrected Q value of â‰¤0.10). Nitric oxide synthase 1 and DDO are genes associated with oxidative stress; B2M is a marker of the fetal inflammatory response. Fetal HPA gene expression is not associated with GA at delivery or sPTB in second-trimester AFS. Alterations of fetal gene expression related to inflammation and oxidative stress antedate clinical symptoms and may be useful for early identification of patients at risk of having an sPTB.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Neeta L.

f312261a268502d433379d353921cd0123d80297,Identification of Genes Enriched in GnRH Neurons by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification and RNAseq in Mice.,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are a nexus of fertility regulation. We used translating ribosome affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing to examine messenger RNAs of GnRH neurons in adult intact and gonadectomized (GDX) male and female mice. GnRH neuron ribosomes were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-labeled polysomes isolated by immunoprecipitation, producing one RNA fraction enhanced for GnRH neuron transcripts and one RNA fraction depleted. Complementary DNA libraries were created from each fraction and 50-base, paired-end sequencing done and differential expression (enhanced fraction/depleted fraction) determined with a threshold of >1.5- or <0.66-fold (false discovery rate P â‰¤ 0.05). A core of âˆ¼840 genes was differentially expressed in GnRH neurons in all treatments, including enrichment for Gnrh1 (âˆ¼40-fold), and genes critical for GnRH neuron and/or gonadotrope development. In contrast, non-neuronal transcripts were not enriched or were de-enriched. Several epithelial markers were also enriched, consistent with the olfactory epithelial origins of GnRH neurons. Interestingly, many synaptic transmission pathways were de-enriched, in accordance with relatively low innervation of GnRH neurons. The most striking difference between intact and GDX mice of both sexes was a marked downregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and upregulation of glucose transporters in GnRH neurons from GDX mice. This may suggest that GnRH neurons switch to an alternate fuel to increase adenosine triphosphate production in the absence of negative feedback when GnRH release is elevated.

We prepared a negative control sample, where we excluded NH2OH from the mixture, and a positive control sample, where we induced ADP-ribosylation in shPARG HEK293T cells using H2O2 treatment, performed Lys-C digest, boronate beads binding, and then NH2OH elution (Supplementary Fig. 2a). We acquired LC-MS/MS data for these three samples and performed database searches using +15.0109 Da on Asp and Glu as a variable modification. We filtered the results to contain a 1 % false discovery rate. We identified a very similar number of total peptides (9447 vs. 9431) as well as Aspand Glu-modified (+15.0109 Da) peptides (68 vs. 74) between the negative control sample and the sample incubated with NH2OH. The number of reverse modified peptides (31 and 32, respectively) suggests that most of these hydroxylamine-derivatized peptides were from spectra of low quality and were likely incorrect identifications. In contrast, the 2236 peptides identified in the positive control sample contained 845 Aspand Glu-modified peptides (with only 8 reverse hits). These results confirm that NH2OH does not cause unwanted side reactions with free Asp and Glu residues.",2013,,"list(name = ""Yajie Zhang"", ids = ""40382942""); list(name = ""Jianqi Wang"", ids = ""48093189""); list(name = ""Man-hua Ding"", ids = ""34999762""); list(name = ""Yonghao Yu"", ids = ""89993921"")",,dec04f6953da930a9657ee344ba4e9a0b5d7622e; da29ecd00aea06d5dc78b3706112eaf2dfac2516; 7ac817c2524af1a21ababb50c97bc777b14c4781; 5b42148347469928c49e3b7ead55d6eeea72fd43; 714d7027bdfd5a5371a8fa4b68e981d307f769d1; a2d4bcf8b2691b3d481017d6129997dcb4c42b82; 634506ecbd641d6040bafb6a835637c094e542ac; 1f61ff55b3fa71b42b9ef324181250786bf83104; 62804aab4dbeffd181ca8ac78fe967fe917fbbdb; 274988390d3e5100ffbd998453e2ec758d69657b; 77c00ee543f31dbad35ddeaa178c1028928d6bc7; ceee6447b291f8052a28c9eb00ca360d6f39f9b1; a9b6cf1403318230441a2b510200bd9ade0d82ff; 48e5c3bb95789037cd75afb946661f8f21091129; 601bab90552947bb6d4924617a9fc9b53ece3285; 5c3c8de7217d998e76d83b88fe8320b37f33f000; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; aedb9507d994d815c4aa0dabf246d30f649adcc3; d6b7f1bdf2967acf0f7c63bf92b9be472832d77f; 6101e2028c1cb479f87fc571172cb802e902f581; 10fd47706b801957fbe1e2af29c2d8b78c457b72; 6e487ab063fc9b945cd2f0c3dfff6655290e3145; e4c18eeffff2c2de786eb1a25ad1e8d9b8e93f01; f83864aa878f7640067e80a04260a78a585f238b,,,
e1c891a39cac531357b4e58f8c90dfa9c6daa9fa,Efficacy of Bone Marrow Derived MSC for Steroid Refractory Acute GVHD Associates with Age and a Defined Molecular Profile of MSC Donors,"Introduction Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) remains a life-threatening complication and substantially reduces efficacy of allo-HSCT. In particular, the outcome of patients with severe steroid-refractory aGVHD continues to be poor. Administration of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) has been reported by others and us as an interesting treatment option (Le, Frassoni et al. 2008, von, Stolzel et al. 2009, Lucchini, Introna et al. 2010, Te Boome, Mansilla et al. 2015). Though insurance and fast track approval has recently been granted to MSC products in Japan and USA, variability arising from donor variability and the inability to link surrogate markers of the product to clinical efficacy could prove to be a major obstacle in daily clinical practice. Materials and Methods We evaluated the impact of individual MSC donors as well as MSC donor properties such as age on clinical response in a cohort of 102 patients with grade II-IV steroid refractory aGVHD treated within a recently reported prospective study as well as an extended hospital exemption program (Te Boome, Mansilla et al. 2015). Bone marrow derived MSC from third party non-HLA matched donors were administered at day 1, 8, and 21 as reported (Te Boome, Mansilla et al. 2015). Primary outcome measures were one year overall survival (OS) and response of GVHD. Cox proportional hazards models, competing risk analyses (Gray9s test) and Kaplan Meier estimates were used for analyzing response and OS respectively. Two different R statistical packages for RNA-seq analysis were used for the calculation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (DeSeq & EdgeR). The DEGs were considered significant based on the overlap across the two methods and a False Discovery Rate/adjusted p-value Results 102 patients received in total 299 MSC infusions derived from 10 different BM donors. Median number of infusions was 3 (range 1-4). 75,5% of patients received all MSC infusions from the same donor, 20,6% with MSC from 2 donors and 3,9% with MSC from 3 different donors. Two donors were used to treat 28,4% and 43,1% of patients respectively. When testing retrospectively impact on 1 year OS of an individual product no differences between patients treated with either the 2 main contributing donors or the patients treated with the 9other9 MSC donors could be observed. However, when donor age was used to cluster cohorts (donor age 10 years) differences were observed (Figure 1) with a survival benefit for patients treated with young donors. Competing risk analysis also revealed a significant benefit for patients only treated with young donors. Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, MSC donor age remained predictive for OS (HR 2,00, p-value 0,025). RNA sequencing analysis was used to further dissect molecular differences between individual donors and allowed to identify a distinctive molecular profile active in MSC that associates with improved clinical outcome. Conclusions In our cohort of 102 patients with steroid refractory acute GVHD that were treated with MSC we observed in this retrospective study differences in achieving both complete resolution of GVHD symptoms and 1 year OS.

36e0a41182fbd6df3669c9f4a3462ddf99b24b30,Gene expression variation between African Americans and whites is associated with coronary artery calcification: the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis.,"Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a strong indicator of total atherosclerosis burden. Epidemiological data have shown substantial differences in CAC prevalence and severity between African Americans and whites. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying initiation and progression of CAC. Microarray gene expression profiling of peripheral blood leucocytes was performed from 119 healthy women aged 50 yr or above in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort; 48 women had CAC score >100 and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) >1 mm, while 71 had CAC <10 and IMT <0.65 mm. When 17 African Americans were compared with 41 whites in the low-CAC group, 409 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate <5%) were identified. In addition, 316 differentially expressed genes were identified between the high- and low-CAC groups. A substantial overlap between these two gene lists was observed (148 genes, P < 10(-6)). Furthermore, genes expressed lower in African Americans also tend to express lower in individuals with low CAC (correlation 0.69, P = 0.002). Ontology analysis of the 409 race-associated genes revealed significant enrichment in mobilization of calcium and immune/inflammatory response (P < 10(-9)).

Methods and Resultsâ€”Using DNA samples collected at baseline in the Physiciansâ€™ Health Study cohort, we genotyped 92 polymorphisms from 56 candidate genes among 304 individuals who subsequently developed VTE (144 idiopathic, 156 secondary cases) and among 2070 individuals who remained free of reported vascular disease over a mean follow-up of 13.2 years to prospectively determine whether these gene polymorphisms contribute to the risk of VTE. For idiopathic VTE, in addition to the factor V (Leiden) mutation (odds ratio [OR], 5.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.24 to 8.14; P 0.0001; false discovery rate [FDR], P 0.0001), an N291S lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphism (OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.56 to 6.09; P 0.001; FDR, P 0.036) and a Q27E 2-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphism (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.79; P 0.006; FDR, P 0.036) were found to be significantly associated with increased risk. For secondary VTE, a Q360H apolipoprotein A4 gene polymorphism (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.65; P 0.001; FDR, P 0.07) and an I50V interleukin-4 receptor polymorphism (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84; P 0.0009; FDR, P 0.07) were moderately, but not statistically and significantly, associated with reduced risk after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Conclusionsâ€“These present findings are hypothesis generating and require replication and confirmation in an independent investigation.

3d0317adea2d2af537ea522802341730ed7b04bf,Association mapping of stigma and spikelet characteristics in rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Stigma and spikelet characteristics play an essential role in hybrid seed production. A mini-core of 90 accessions developed from USDA rice core collection was phenotyped in field grown for nine traits of stigma and spikelet and genotyped with 109 DNA markers, 108 SSRs plus an indel. Three major clusters were built upon Rogersâ€™ genetic distance, indicative of indicas, and temperate and tropical japonicas. A mixed linear model combining PC-matrix and K-matrix was adapted for mapping marker-trait associations. Resulting associations were adjusted using false discovery rate technique. We identified 34 marker-trait associations involving 22 SSR markers for eight traits. Four markers were associated with single stigma exsertion (SStgE), six with dual exsertion (DStgE) and five with total exsertion. RM5_Chr1 played major role indicative of high regression with not only DStgE but also SStgE. Four markers were associated with spikelet length, three with width and seven with L/W ratio. Numerous markers were co-associated with multiple traits that were phenotypically correlated, i.e. RM12521_Chr2 associated with all three correlated spikelet traits. The co-association should improve breeding efficiency because single marker could be used to assist breeding for multiple traits. Indica entry 1032 (cultivar 50638) and japonica entry 671 (cultivar Linia 84 Icar) with 80.65 and 75.17% of TStgE, respectively are recommended to breeder for improving stigma exsertion.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""W.

76d59c397625e61970c128926c8fb8ea787bbc37,Genetic background influences murine prostate gene expression: implications for cancer phenotypes,"BackgroundCancer of the prostate is influenced by both genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The identification of genes capable of modulating cancer development has the potential to unravel disease heterogeneity and aid diagnostic and prevention strategies. To this end, mouse models have been developed to isolate the influences of individual genetic lesions in the context of consistent genotypes and environmental exposures. However, the normal prostatic phenotypic variability dictated by a genetic background that is potentially capable of influencing the process of carcinogenesis has not been established.ResultsIn this study we used microarray analysis to quantify transcript levels in the prostates of five commonly studied inbred mouse strains. We applied a multiclass response t-test and determined that approximately 13% (932 genes) exhibited differential expression (range 1.3-190-fold) in any one strain relative to other strains (false discovery rate â‰¤10%). Expression differences were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, or immunohistochemistry for several genes previously shown to influence cancer progression, such as Psca, Mmp7, and Clusterin. Analyses of human prostate transcripts orthologous to variable murine prostate genes identified differences in gene expression in benign epithelium that correlated with the differentiation state of adjacent tumors. For example, the gene encoding apolipoprotein D, which is known to enhance resistance to cell stress, was expressed at significantly greater levels in benign epithelium associated with high-grade versus low-grade cancers.ConclusionThese studies support the concept that the cellular, tissue, and organismal context contribute to oncogenesis and suggest that a predisposition to a sequence of events leading to pathology may exist prior to cancer initiation.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniella Bianchi-Frias"", ids = ""1400804027""); list(name = ""Colin C.

5e1fecceb8f6b29cfc6cf290ab21be63d812834a,Systematic identification of interaction effects between genome- and environment-wide associations in type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) result from environmental and genetic factors, and risk varies considerably in the population. T2D-related genetic loci discovered to date explain only a small portion of the T2D heritability. Some heritability may be due to geneâ€“environment interactions. However, documenting these interactions has been difficult due to low availability of concurrent genetic and environmental measures, selection bias, and challenges in controlling for multiple hypothesis testing. Through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), investigators have identified over 90Â single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated to T2D. Using a method analogous to GWAS [environment-wide association study (EWAS)], we found five environmental factors associated with the disease. By focusing on risk factors that emerge from GWAS and EWAS, it is possible to overcome difficulties in uncovering geneâ€“environment interactions. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we screened 18 SNPs and 5 serum-based environmental factors for interaction in association to T2D. We controlled for multiple hypotheses using false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni correction and found four interactions with FDR <20Â %. The interaction between rs13266634 (SLC30A8) and trans-Î²-carotene withstood Bonferroni correction (corrected pÂ =Â 0.006, FDR <1.5Â %). The per-risk-allele effect sizes in subjects with low levels of trans-Î²-carotene were 40Â % greater than the marginal effect size [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95Â % CI 1.3â€“2.6]. We hypothesize that impaired function driven by rs13266634 increases T2D risk when combined with serum levels of nutrients. Unbiased consideration of environmental and genetic factors may help identify larger and more relevant effect sizes for disease associations.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chirag J.

c331d0a70ba4907282f3c4579af6c1adbd8d5950,Fecal Microbiota Analysis in Patients Going through a Depressive Episode during Treatment in a Psychiatric Hospital Setting,"RATIONALE
There is a worldwide prevalence of generalized anxiety and major depressive disorders (MDD). Gutâ»brain axis dysfunction, antibacterial activity, and modulatory effects of antidepressants toward intestinal bacteria have been shown both in vitro and in vivo.


OBJECTIVES
In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of hospital stay, including escitalopram administration, on gut microbiota in patients with depressive episodes.


METHODS
After admission to the hospital and 7-days washout from all medications the composition of fecal microbiota samples was evaluated at baseline (W0) and after 6 weeks (W6), using 16S rRNA sequencing. The study was conducted on 17 inpatients (52.9% females), who followed the same daily hospital routine, including a standard diet and received 5â»20 mg daily doses of escitalopram.


RESULTS
At the end of treatment (W6), no change was observed in the Chao1 index. However, Shannon (median (Q1â»Q3): W0 2.78 (2.67â»3.02) vs. W6 3.11 (2.80â»3.30)), and inverse Simpson (median (Q1â»Q3): W0 9.26 (7.26â»13.76) vs. W6 12.13 (9.17â»15.73)) indices increased significantly compared to baseline values (False Discovery Rate p (q) = 0.031 and q = 0.011, respectively). We also found that between-subject W0 Brayâ»Curtis dissimilarities were significantly higher than W0â»W6 within-subject dissimilarities (median (Q1â»Q3): 0.68 (0.56â»0.77) vs. 0.38 (0.35â»0.52), two sided Mannâ»Whitney test p < 0.00001. The within-subject dissimilarities did not depend on sex, age, BMI, illness duration and a daily dose of escitalopram. No significant differences between taxa levels, at the studied time points, were observed when adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing procedures.


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that a six-week treatment in a psychiatric hospital setting resulted in increased alpha biodiversity in fecal microbiota, however its causal relationship with patients' mental health was not proved. We have also found that individual microbiome stability was not affected by hospitalization.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""PaweÅ‚ LiÅ›kiewicz"", ids = ""66533957""); list(name = ""Justyna PeÅ‚ka-Wysiecka"", ids = ""1401497592""); list(name = ""Mariusz Kaczmarczyk"", ids = ""2206274""); list(name = ""Igor Å\201oniewski"", ids = ""32132226""); list(name = ""Michal Wronski"", ids = ""40034898""); list(name = ""Agata BÄ…ba-KubiÅ›"", ids = ""1419032609""); list(name = ""Karolina Skonieczna-Å»ydecka"", ids = ""1399314843""); list(name = ""Wojciech Marlicz"", ids = ""5649584""); list(name = ""BÅ‚aÅ¼ej Misiak"", ids = ""3402104""); list(name = ""Jerzy Samochowiec"", ids = ""47322508"")",c073207aad197568cd9272b6d33532b41b6a9c49; 3357e5ac31dc415d34fc4ac98f6d947d071497a7; bf35ca66bfee19555b4e70f0071c2ac31b685041; 07b36e95448927b4431e6681c767d3987bfde025; 5bd8ce770078a905ea37e81f8ed649aac83fa562,b7d192358e44caa28c89c9392c9f56fc44ff90b9; 08e2c3f02862b3e8fe826a596fa36b98bda663df; 249d2615f1decde5eb8ec113f109931f8d2de0d9; d1e0db77dc6a918a262934709b7c9e4a38b92953; 9ced84337ba98324b3bc5ab882dfcfa2ea765cc2; b20891b86e5a102261bd070912462e1f8e8d3b5a; 39f63af784af7837cdc72b4f721ca00020d6df88; 41b51043d9470b435095ebfbe25ab5dc621500fc; 0a41edbb05fc3c686556de015d781f63a897ce05; 6a21df1eb42ae8a2015928a418a6e0649eb36613; e1d3c67c37eed34a0a995134e95e0c14bcd23bfd; 714115dd1e3b353d3af259121dc2c265c59b9cdd; dcbe482cdd59354884f545fd7405396268fa3f09; 94be048f9e67428bce73ac82fadd3d4ff7e1e1b3; 089307a687fdfc53574ffa9926457f7d81d16480; d1f710adb42106fced9b321f73db46ea2f56c20e; b9ef0fab807df25ed5aef2d25318bea4ebf2adac; dc20034f555923972bcadec33c452d3f34fa981f; 733958e3fc5a21b3c89d6f88bf3b0fa2b1caa0ad; b0e1401c9c08fe5c0335db81406e748c9b66f243; 41e124af164567a8fd5feeb89a3ef9735aad9de7; 34a5bfc25b6e774a5a2bdc8eb277897c0e0eebba; 7bb580ee39436fe0d4a74afa01153af3a49f808e; 3d48c9b70da8e586d48cd03952ee1031ef91e53a; c55b4f81b370afa55c2793645e2028ac3293c9ac; b410b9cf4d7f1d4ae7f1a0f613a343e0e511f1a7; de5dca06c1f86a5918b7ee8ffd844b048a271631; d7acc9a8b2e59d2b94cc614a69014b79f8b18036; 039546660329655cca510207edb236a79a98e970; f980a71f6daf62c3999c57d64cabda402ce39a17; d7760fa40fcd7ff3ebcdd5de97fa56b8d76a70c4; 78a4eff40d42e29c2a157a48b35620dcfd5625ae; 786ff456100aa07e9e25021c0e595b7df63e0f78; 3c7bcecd0b41b3649f9e03a6e13b9a8fefd7b61f; e57b5f889bdfc32685123dd8acbf833880f8c43e; 8d6a6886de5eb95213baa6183508dda564ef327b; ef24c465616cea9a3ca080ad604765a7261e3bd9; 038d441671d31aa82e5ff0e30a4ad8a27844e53d; 6cda6c8daad108e573aa8a17ea737512c6558f28; c205c2b65b59522c4803586a5323eb9049f1c3ed; cffc355ed28825fca63b81aefa51c920ab16d586; dd412d1d34d41d8d899d4628270e1fc74959248f; 1d0f0c3fe41ffee3e87063929a307e5958bb964e; a669b8bb8e37897e9c1c665688e13a9a379ee10b; 6cf54c91c2da814f116d86067ecda55ea9576d0c; 263bd1028081307d9bd51805c6cc80100ff806fa; 59a480a2e339040304001488ae509cd07be3929b; 8d0b51c248f44c0cbe7ab1b123e5e24069586704; 6dec10a8bc74309c20fe4ae5251b07ee6adaef5e; 484a8fad22a8a8c7fb3e3b6e7182e6f8fce4eebd,Journal of Clinical Medicine,8,
beaa2977963e839aef7d59a5f6fbe865f452c37d,Are samples in your freezer still good for biomarker discovery?,"Diagnostic markers can be used for detecting diseases, predicting response to a therapy, making prognosis for a patient, or estimating the outcome of a treatment. Despite great progress in instrumentation and analytical techniques, few new biomarkers have been discovered during the past decade. Some reasons for slow progress are the low throughput of analysis, high false discovery rate, lack of data on verification of the discovered potential biomarkers, and poor stability of many biomolecules. Human blood contains enzymes and proteases, which alter proteins in vivo and in vitro. Studies have suggested that many peptides identified in biological samples are generated by proteolytic cleavage of plasma proteins, which are subsequently altered by peptidases. 3,4 Some of the degradation takes place in vivo, while many of the products could be generated in vitro during blood collection and sample storage. Considering this, peptides identified in the biomarker discovery experiments could be intermediates of sequential reactions, which are unstable over time and could arise from biological variability related to sample collection or handling, or be detected because of technical variability during the analysis. 5,6 It is known that the stability of many proteins differs between serum and plasma samples collected in tubes with different types of anticoagulants. Differences associated with different sample types are associated with inhibition of the endogenous proteases by anticoagulants, which reduce activity of the proteases. Residual plasma protease and peptidase activity results in time-dependent variations and instability of the samples, especially during sample collection and processing. Results of a study by Yi et al 7 suggest that mixing protease inhibitors with blood immediately during blood collection results in enhanced stabilization of plasma proteome. Proteases can be subdivided into 4 classes: serine, cysteine, aspartic, and metalloproteases. Peptidases belong to 1 of 3 classes: endo-, exo-, and carboxypeptidases. In vivo, proteins are either protected from proteolysis in specialized compartments or reside in a protective conformation. When proteins are isolated from cells, there is a potential for their degradation via proteolytic enzymes. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are often used in experimental protocols to protect proteins from degradation. More than 100 naturally occurring PIs have been identified and can be used during the sample collection to prevent protein degradation. Monitoring and controlling preanalytical variations have a major impact on the success of work in biomarker discovery and verification. In this issue of the Journal, Findeisen et al 8 assess the exposure of serum and plasma samples to suboptimal storage conditions. Considering that the outcome of experiments is affected by protein stability, the authors suggest determining the preanalytical quality of serum and plasma by monitoring the time-dependent decay of a synthetic reporter peptide (RP) added to the samples at the time of sample collection. In the study, serum and plasma specimens were spiked with the RP, and proteolytic fragments were monitored at different time points up to 24 hours after blood sample collection. In the proposed method, analysis of the RP and its degradation product was performed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The sequence of the RP and the monitored fragments were selected with a goal of having properties, allowing time-dependent degradation of the RP with accumulation of stable RP. Quantitative measurement of the RP was shown to enable monitoring of the preanalytical",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark M.

e207c2ec67d0c501f833f5557997b84ba8104c26,Immune checkpoint blockade as a potential therapeutic target: surveying CNS malignancies.,"BACKGROUND
Expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) across glioma grades is undocumented, and their interactions with commonly expressed genetic and epigenetic alterations are undefined but nonetheless highly relevant to combinatorial treatments.


METHODS
Patients with CNS malignancies were profiled by Caris Life Sciences from 2009 to 2016. Immunohistochemistry findings for PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 on tumor cells were available for 347 cases. Next-generation sequencing, pyrosequencing, immunohistochemistry, fragment analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to determine isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor protein 53 mutational status, O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation (MGMT-Me) status, PTEN expression, plus epidermal growth factor receptor variant III and 1p/19q codeletion status.


RESULTS
PD-1+ TIL expression and grade IV gliomas were significantly positively correlated (odds ratio [OR]: 6.363; 95% CI: 1.263, 96.236)-especially in gliosarcomas compared with glioblastoma multiforme (P = .014). PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor grade with all PD-L1+ cases (n = 21) being associated with grade IV gliomas. PD-1+ TIL expression and PD-L1 expression were significantly correlated (OR: 5.209; 95% CI: 1.555, 20.144). Mutations of PTEN, tumor protein 53, BRAF, IDH1, and epidermal growth factor receptor or MGMT-Me did not associate with increased intratumoral expression of either PD-1+ TIL or PD-L1 in glioblastoma multiforme even before false discovery rate correction for multiple comparison.

Targeting immune checkpoints in combination with other therapeutics based on positive biomarker selection will require screening of large patient cohorts.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah T Garber"", ids = ""48793647""); list(name = ""Yuuri Hashimoto"", ids = ""152937128""); list(name = ""Shiao-Pei S Weathers"", ids = ""48461544""); list(name = ""Joanne Xiu"", ids = ""10719782""); list(name = ""Zoran Gatalica"", ids = ""5401139""); list(name = ""Roel G.

Leukemia stem cells differentiate to give rise to leukemic progenitor cells (LPC) and ultimately leukemic blasts which are not leukemia-initiating. Previous studies have revealed a diverse methylation landscape in AML, but have mostly relied on the blast population rather than more purified primitive populations. Consequently, the status of the leukemic methylome during expansion from LSC to LPC and finally blast remains largely unknown. We sorted HSC from the bone marrow of normal donors and LSC, LPC, and blasts from AML patients based on expression of CD34, CD38, CD45 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Normal HSC were defined as CD34 + CD38 - ALDH high . In AML patients, LSC were either CD34 + CD38 - ALDH high or CD34 + CD38 - ALDH mid ; LPC were CD34 + CD38 + ; the blast population consisted of unsorted mononuclear cells. Though patients with an ALDH high LSC profile may have had some residual normal HSCs present, contribution of these cells was likely minimal and thus the overall population predominantly leukemic. Methylation profiles for each cell fraction in eight untreated AML patients and five normal donors were generated using the enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (ERRBS) assay. All sequenced ERRBS libraries were aligned against the human genome (hg19) and organized into 25 base pair tiles for analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMR) using a beta-binomial model that takes variation across samples into account during DMR identification. DMR classification required a difference in methylation of >25% and false discovery rate (FDR) high LSC were distinct from the six patients with ALDH mid LSC and therefore patients were grouped based on the ADLH activity of their LSCs for comparisons. Both ALDH high LSC and ALDH mid LSC had extensive alterations in methylation across their genomes when compared to HSC. The great majority of DMRs in ALDH high LSC were hypomethylated; of the 62,415 DMRs identified, 55,418 regions were hypomethylated while only 6,997 were hypermethylated in ALDH high LSC. In contrast, in ALDH mid LSC, 39,162 DMRs were hypermethylated and 5,408 regions hypomethylated compared to HSC. Despite opposing patterns of methylation, DMRs were enriched at intergenic and intragenic enhancers in both ALDH high and ALDH mid LSC. DMRs were functionally annotated to gene sets in the MSigDb database. Genes associated with ALDH high DMRs were enriched for genes with the binding motif for transcription factor Sp1 near their promoters (FDR = 2.55Ã—10 -79 ) and ALDH mid DMR associated genes were enriched for genes with H3K27 trimethylation in their promoters (FDR = 7.19Ã—10 -169 ). We compared methylation profiles of LSC to LPC and blasts in an effort to determine whether changes to the methylome occur with leukemic maturation. Interestingly, there were no significant changes in methylation between LSC and LPC in either ALDH population. However, we did see changes to the epigenome emerge when LSC or LPC were compared to leukemic blasts. In ALDH high patients, LSC and LPC were more hypomethylated than blasts while ALDH mid LSC and LPC were more hypermethylated than the more differentiated blasts. In conclusion, alterations to the LSC methylome were extensive and two patterns of methylation emerged based on the ALDH activity of LSC; ALDH high LSC displayed hypomethylated profiles and ALDH mid LSC were hypermethylated. Enrichment of DMRs at intra and intergenic enhancer regions in both LSC types despite their opposing methylation patterns highlights the importance of epigenetic marks in these regions and their role as regulators of gene expression. Significant changes in methylation between LSC or LPC and blasts, but not LSC and LPC suggest relative stability of the methylome during early leukemic differentiation with more substantial alterations occurring after the LPC level.

fc6336de53a2b09931db99c82e3d3457ea0d423e,In-utero epigenetic factors are associated with early-onset myopia in young children,"OBJECTIVES
To assess whether epigenetic mechanisms affecting gene expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of early-onset myopia, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation analyses of umbilical cord tissues, and assessed any associations between CpG site-specific methylation and the development of the disorder when the children were 3 years old.


METHODS
Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of umbilical cord samples from 519 Singaporean infants involved in a prospective birth cohort 'Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes' (GUSTO) was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K chip microarray. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess any associations between site-specific CpG methylation of umbilical cord tissue at birth and myopia risk in 3 year old children, adjusting for potential confounders. Gene expression of genes located near CpG sites that demonstrated statistically significant associations were measured in relevant ocular tissues using human and mouse fetal and adult eye samples.


RESULTS
We identified statistically significant associations between DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites and early-onset myopia risk after correcting for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 5%. Two statistically significant CpG sites were identified in intergenic regions: 8p23(p = 1.70Ã—10-7) and 12q23.2(p = 2.53Ã—10-7). The remaining 3 statistically significant CpG sites were identified within the following genes: FGB (4q28, p = 3.60Ã—10-7), PQLC1 (18q23, p = 8.9Ã—10-7) and KRT12 (17q21.2, p = 1.2Ã—10-6). Both PQLC1 and KRT12 were found to be significantly expressed in fetal and adult cornea and sclera tissues in both human and mouse.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified five CpG methylation sites that demonstrate a statistically significant association with increased risk of developing early-onset myopia. These findings suggest that variability in the neonatal cord epigenome may influence early-onset myopia risk in children. Further studies of the epigenetic influences on myopia risk in larger study populations, and the associations with adulthood myopia risk are warranted.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Jie Seow"", ids = ""3754595""); list(name = ""Cheryl S Ngo"", ids = ""35598395""); list(name = ""Hong Pan"", ids = ""49349128""); list(name = ""Veluchamy Amutha Barathi"", ids = ""5632442""); list(name = ""Stuart W J Tompson"", ids = ""7351935""); list(name = ""Kristina N Whisenhunt"", ids = ""10017670""); list(name = ""Eranga Vithana"", ids = ""145946729""); list(name = ""Yap-Seng Chong"", ids = ""145356401""); list(name = ""Suh-Hang Hank Juo"", ids = ""4320278""); list(name = ""Pirro G.

e1c5415ff4b11c005f282658123f78bc6d1e8cf8,Discovery of mRNA Biomarkers Predicting Donor Lung Failure,"Purpose Normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a new method to assess and improve donor lungs prior to committing to transplant (Tx). We have increased the time a lung can stably undergo EVLP from 4 to 12 h in the lab. To discover donor lung biomarkers that can predict the likelihood of poor outcome, we used a genome-wide RNA expression study focused on phenotypes related to EVLP performance. Methods and Materials We collected brain death donor lung biopsies at end of cold ischemic time which were unable to stably complete extended (12 h) EVLP (n=4), which stably completed 12 h EVLP and passed clinical criteria for Tx, despite not undergoing Tx (n=4), and which stably completed 4 h EVLP, had Tx and produced good recipient outcome (n=12). Samples were analyzed on Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays. Results Initial analysis suggested that lungs able to complete 12 h EVLP are similar to lungs with good outcome Tx. In contrast, lungs failing to complete 12 h EVLP form a distinct group. Further analysis treated the former 2 groups as a single group (control) for comparison with the latter group (fail). Using a false discovery rate (FDR) Figure 1 shows a hierarchically clustered heatmap of these genes, demonstrating the distinctiveness of the fail lungs. Of these genes, 119 had relative fold > 2x, 278 had no overlapping intensity values (AUC=1), and 29 were both > 2x and AUC=1. These may be highly predicative biomarkers of lung quality. Conclusions We find that extended EVLP may be a good indicator of Tx outcome. Differential expression between extreme EVLP performance phenotypes indicates large transcript differences and has provided several potential mRNA biomarkers of Tx lung failure or success.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ricardo Zamel"", ids = ""6225617""); list(name = ""Tiago Noguchi Machuca"", ids = ""5493232""); list(name = ""Jonathan Chi-Wai Yeung"", ids = ""39166602""); list(name = ""Riccardo Bonato"", ids = ""34786619""); list(name = ""Xiao-hui Bai"", ids = ""47055457""); list(name = ""Thomas K Waddell"", ids = ""144062503""); list(name = ""Mingyao Liu"", ids = ""144292268""); list(name = ""Marcelo Cypel"", ids = ""3622596""); list(name = ""Shaf Keshavjee"", ids = ""66913149"")",cc1b952cf223120a4256ceeb2e8e7b71b3718046; 58c3f3bed9c83aa0e3ace6c1227b5cf035ad4ecc,,Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,32,
16354cb9d176c35dd0589fac2f2a3238a566399d,Multiplex Screen of Serum Biomarkers in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy.,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies have proposed a unified genetic model for Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), identifying potential therapeutic targets for future clinical trials. Serum biomarkers related to disease activity will be important for proof of concept or early phase clinical studies.


OBJECTIVE
To identify potential serum biomarkers in FSHD for possible use in future clinical trials.


METHODS
We performed a prospective cross-sectional study of serum biomarkers in 22 FSHD patients (19 FSHD1, 3 FSHD2) compared to 23 age and gender-matched healthy controls using a commercial multiplex, microsphere-based immune-fluorescent assay of 243 markers (Myriad, Human Discovery MAP 250, v2.0).


RESULTS
169 markers had values sufficient for analysis. Correction for multiple testing identified 7 biomarkers below a 5% false discovery rate: creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB, 6.52 fold change, P<0.0001), tissue-type plasminogen activator (PLAT, 1.64 fold change, P<0.0001), myoglobin (2.23 fold change, P=0.0001), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 2.33 fold change, P=0.0004), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (1.48 fold change, P=0.0004), CD 40 ligand (1.89 fold change, P=0.001), and vitronectin (VTN, 1.28 fold change, P=0.001). Moderate correlations to measures of FSHD disease were seen for CKMB, PLAT, and EGF. Markers in the plasminogen pathway (PLAT, serpin peptidase inhibitor, and VTN) were correlated with each other in FSHD but not healthy controls.


CONCLUSIONS
Commercial multiplex immune-fluorescent screening is a potentially powerful tool for identifying biomarkers for future FSHD therapeutic trials.

564922e4bd75cd92f229ac9ca5a6b3066cb77002,Thresholding of cryo-EM density maps by false discovery rate control,"Cryo-EM now commonly generates close-to-atomic resolution as well as intermediate resolution maps from macromolecules observed in isolation and in situ. Interpreting these maps remains a challenging task due to poor signal in the highest resolution shells and the necessity to select a threshold for density analysis. In order to facilitate this process, we developed a statistical framework for the generation of confidence maps by multiple hypothesis testing and false discovery rate (FDR) control. In this way, 3D confidence maps contain separated signal from background noise in the form of local detection rates of EM density values. We demonstrate that confidence maps and FDR-based thresholding can be used for the interpretation of near-atomic resolution single-particle structures as well as lower resolution maps determined by subtomogram averaging. Confidence maps represent a conservative way of interpreting molecular structures due to minimized noise. At the same time they provide a detection error with respect to background noise, which is associated with the density and particularly beneficial for the interpretation of weaker cryo-EM densities in cases of conformational flexibility and lower occupancy of bound molecules and ions to the structure.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Maximilian Beckers"", ids = ""23971782""); list(name = ""Arjen J.

Shotgun proteomics analyzes mixtures at the peptide-level to generate MS/MS spectra that are then used to identify the peptides and proteins from which they were derived. We developed a method in our laboratory utilizing SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion coupled with reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS/MS) for proteomic analysis of LCM-acquired cells. This method was then applied to a clinical sample set consisting of basal, Her2-overexpressing and luminal A frozen tumor tissues as determined by prior microarray studies. Three tumors per group were dissected in triplicate, for a total of 27 samples. Each dissection consisted of approximately 10,000 cells, corresponding to 3-5 Î¼g protein. Following LCM, the thermoplastic membranes containing the captured cells were peeled from the cap, suspended in SDS loading buffer and gently heated for 10 minutes. The solubilized proteins were electrophoresed 2 cm into a 10-20% Tricine gel followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and peptide extraction. Replicate LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic peptides from each of the 27 samples was performed on a Thermo LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer. The resultant tandem mass spectra were searched against the human IPI database using the Myrimatch search algorithm and the results filtered using IDPicker. A spectral counting approach was applied to the data-dependent data to compare quantitative differences among the identified proteins. A total of 91,646 spectra were confidently identified, corresponding to 1671 protein groups across all biological and technical replicates. An average of 545, 543, and 610 protein groups were identified in the basal, ERBB2, and luminal A subtypes, respectively, from an equivalent of approximately 800 cells. Spectral count differences between datasets were analyzed using both a Quasi-likelihood Poisson regression model, developed in-house, and the Limma package in Bioconductor.

199df739b2fb962b0c535d8c5e5ae3969de109ca,Rare Genomic Structural Variants in Complex Disease: Lessons from the Replication of Associations with Obesity,"The limited ability of common variants to account for the genetic contribution to complex disease has prompted searches for rare variants of large effect, to partly explain the 'missing heritability'. Analyses of genome-wide genotyping data have identified genomic structural variants (GSVs) as a source of such rare causal variants. Recent studies have reported multiple GSV loci associated with risk of obesity. We attempted to replicate these associations by similar analysis of two familial-obesity case-control cohorts and a population cohort, and detected GSVs at 11 out of 18 loci, at frequencies similar to those previously reported. Based on their reported frequencies and effect sizes (ORâ‰¥25), we had sufficient statistical power to detect the large majority (80%) of genuine associations at these loci. However, only one obesity association was replicated. Deletion of a 220 kb region on chromosome 16p11.2 has a carrier population frequency of 2Ã—10(-4) (95% confidence interval [9.6Ã—10(-5)-3.1Ã—10(-4)]); accounts overall for 0.5% [0.19%-0.82%] of severe childhood obesity cases (P = 3.8Ã—10(-10); odds ratio = 25.0 [9.9-60.6]); and results in a mean body mass index (BMI) increase of 5.8 kg.m(-2) [1.8-10.3] in adults from the general population. We also attempted replication using BMI as a quantitative trait in our population cohort; associations with BMI at or near nominal significance were detected at two further loci near KIF2B and within FOXP2, but these did not survive correction for multiple testing. These findings emphasise several issues of importance when conducting rare GSV association, including the need for careful cohort selection and replication strategy, accurate GSV identification, and appropriate correction for multiple testing and/or control of false discovery rate. Moreover, they highlight the potential difficulty in replicating rare CNV associations across different populations. Nevertheless, we show that such studies are potentially valuable for the identification of variants making an appreciable contribution to complex disease.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robin G.

Currently, disease severity is determined by self-reported scores to a list of symptoms which can be highly subjective. A more objective measure would allow for improved data analysis.MethodsTwenty-one volunteers participated in an influenza challenge trial. We calculated the daily sum of scores (DSS) for a list of 16 influenza symptoms. Whole blood collected at baseline and 24, 48, 72 and 96Â h post challenge was profiled on Illumina HT12v4 microarrays. Changes in gene expression most strongly correlated with DSS were selected to train a Random Forest model and tested on two independent test sets consisting of 41 individuals profiled on a different microarray platform and 33 volunteers assayed by qRT-PCR.Results1456 probes are significantly associated with DSS at 1% false discovery rate. We selected 19 genes with the largest fold change to train a random forest model. We observed good concordance between predicted and actual scores in the first test set (rÂ =Â 0.57; RMSEÂ =Â âˆ’16.1%) with the greatest agreement achieved on samples collected approximately 72Â h post challenge. Therefore, we assayed samples collected at baseline and 72Â h post challenge in the second test set by qRT-PCR and observed good concordance (rÂ =Â 0.81; RMSEÂ =Â âˆ’36.1%).ConclusionsWe developed a 19-gene qRT-PCR panel to predict DSS, validated on two independent datasets. A transcriptomics based panel could provide a more objective measure of symptom scoring in future influenza challenge studies.

Numerous Genome Wide Association (GWA) studies of large populations have provided limited biomarkers for cancer and few linkages to phenotype. We investigated whether SNPs that are known to be associated with prostate cancer (PCa) affect expression in prostate stroma. The stroma of prostate tumors provides genetically homogenous tissue type with hundreds of tumor-dependent expression changes [1] which favors linkage identification. We surveyed published GWA studies covering a total of âˆ¼90,000 patients and selected the most significant 35 susceptibility loci for further linkage analysis. We also selected 4030 transcripts previously associated with PCa diagnosis and prognosis. We then investigated 47 PCa cases using genetic variations in nontumor DNA (Illumina Human1M-Duov3_B snp arrays) and correlating the genotypes with RNA gene expression data from the same patients (U133 plus 2.0 arrays). A novel eQTL (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) analysis was carried out by a modified BAYES method to analyze the associations between the risk variants and expressed transcripts jointly in a single model. The model assumed that a risk variant can be associated with multiple RNA expression changes and vice versa. We observed 47 significant linkages between 8 risk variants and 46 significant expression changes. The false discovery rates of two resampling studies are 0.03 and 0.05, respectively, which indicated the 47 linkages are significant. All linkages are â€œtrans' linkages indicating remote effects of key SNPs on expressing genes. This is the first study to identify trans-linkages between multiple SNPs and multiple significant expression changes identified in cancer stroma. The linkages also associated with trends in clinical phenotypes. The strongest trend is between linkage rs9623117(C)-FOXD1 and biochemical relapse (p=0.01). The study reveals links between SNPs associated with PCa risk and transcription, which may identify the subset of patients where these genotypes may affect relevant phenotypes.

Many diagnostic techniques have been successfully presented to diagnose the problems. However, the complexity in the tooth decaying diagnosis ascends when the environs are moderately difficult. Thus, this study introduces a novel caries detecting model for the accurate detection of tooth cavities. The model is divided into two phases: feature extraction and classification. Here, the feature extraction is based on multi-linear principal component analysis (MPCA), and the classification is processed using renowned neural network (NN) classifier. The NN classifier is trained using the adaptive dragonfly algorithm (ADA) algorithm. The proposed MPCA model Non-linear Programming with ADA (MNP-ADA) performance is compared with other existing methods and the performance of the approach is analysed in terms of measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false positive rate, false negative rate, negative predictive value, false discovery rate, F

8c3092f46501ce42c38be37b1f5433bdb20db0ed,Altered expression of histamine signaling genes in autism spectrum disorder,"The histaminergic system (HS) has a critical role in cognition, sleep and other behaviors. Although not well studied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the HS is implicated in many neurological disorders, some of which share comorbidity with ASD, including Tourette syndrome (TS). Preliminary studies suggest that antagonism of histamine receptors 1â€“3 reduces symptoms and specific behaviors in ASD patients and relevant animal models. In addition, the HS mediates neuroinflammation, which may be heightened in ASD. Together, this suggests that the HS may also be altered in ASD. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we investigated genome-wide expression, as well as a focused gene set analysis of key HS genes (HDC, HNMT, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3 and HRH4) in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) initially in 13 subjects with ASD and 39 matched controls. At the genome level, eight transcripts were differentially expressed (false discovery rateâ€‰<0.05), six of which were small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). There was no significant diagnosis effect on any of the individual HS genes but expression of the gene set of HNMT, HRH1, HRH2 and HRH3 was significantly altered. Curated HS gene sets were also significantly differentially expressed. Differential expression analysis of these gene sets in an independent RNA-seq ASD data set from DLPFC of 47 additional subjects confirmed these findings. Understanding the physiological relevance of an altered HS may suggest new therapeutic options for the treatment of ASD.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Carrie L.

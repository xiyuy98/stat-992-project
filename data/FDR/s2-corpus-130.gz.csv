d640412f3dfb4b5539d8b8aab2e0e2d225f795ff,A moment-based method for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses and its application to microarray gene expression data.,"Due to advances in experimental technologies, it is feasible to collect measurements for a large number of variables. When these variables are simultaneously screened by a statistical test, it is necessary to consider the adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. The false discovery rate has been proposed and widely used to address this issue. A related problem is the estimation of the proportion of true null hypotheses. The long-standing difficulty to this problem is the identifiability of the nonparametric model. In this study, we propose a moment-based method coupled with sample splitting for estimating this proportion. If the p values from the alternative hypothesis are homogeneously distributed, then the proposed method will solve the identifiability and give its optimal performances. When the p values from the alternative hypothesis are heterogeneously distributed, we propose to approximate this mixture distribution so that the identifiability can be achieved. Theoretical aspects of the approximation error are discussed. The proposed estimation method is completely nonparametric and simple with an explicit formula. Simulation studies show the favorable performances of the proposed method when it is compared to the other existing methods. Two microarray gene expression data sets are considered for applications.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yinglei Lai"", ids = ""37943518"")",84e034ebd3d51ad7a43b9ee7a05bdf9ddcee7564; 39bb8926f6547093c75fdf7f7cb8118d39e510a0; f6a2a45e6de0a8d29810bb749d1c48cc5bb63a18; 1b401062762e6d39a7d05cbeecb621eb28dd2cc5; 522a22f15190643e99bdd4a14357665443216260; 289355a54eee1fad98471f32105823cb059a5b76; c21dde7f60fd7424d1252691bd922b1e81328cd4; 1b0ca9b233933cc316b3009eb312f070c897e5d7; 424f2627bc0c4bee7a5b54f63797a419163f72e1; b66f88aa0454a1f7c1d1ebb7209cee3baec1b175; 96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3; b3f7d74986afb92b26139520754b44c724e11783; 8a2a09ef11ef10e20e2cbe0610390e6cdf6a9a1c; b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c; a3177c344129298455445edb7902d40cd9dd3bc1,68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 7025bdb9317ac27892f6c0c35befd961c3105224; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 147e6bebf230699683bb8bdd6c21ef4734706003; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 24f3e29d9feab95e78f3f47364c4edbae34adfd2; d3001913e21d745ea6a430077869bb290ad86cc6; 0acec919dfb7485853f190dcd77baf15a640e7ac; eae97fb7c27ecafa785bc67dce5c0a9f211c3bb4; 3484e3211669ca2620116e0471e26e0f0ab4f174; 7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7; 44a299bb724fd0cb68bd73b8926af235a237ec81; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; 504ccd6a13134f4d8ef417e8dd8e3541959c14b6,Biostatistics,8 4,"

ae1486fdb71f4c230b6f3f34e491ce90a8a0deba,Improved Point Source Detection in Crowded Fields using Probabilistic Cataloging,"Cataloging is challenging in crowded fields because sources are extremely covariant with their neighbors and blending makes even the number of sources ambiguous. We present the first optical probabilistic catalog, cataloging a crowded (~0.1 sources per pixel brighter than 22nd magnitude in F606W) Sloan Digital Sky Survey r band image from M2. Probabilistic cataloging returns an ensemble of catalogs inferred from the image and thus can capture source-source covariance and deblending ambiguities. By comparing to a traditional catalog of the same image and a Hubble Space Telescope catalog of the same region, we show that our catalog ensemble better recovers sources from the image. It goes more than a magnitude deeper than the traditional catalog while having a lower false discovery rate brighter than 20th magnitude. We also present an algorithm for reducing this catalog ensemble to a condensed catalog that is similar to a traditional catalog, except it explicitly marginalizes over source-source covariances and nuisance parameters. We show that this condensed catalog has a similar completeness and false discovery rate to the catalog ensemble. Future telescopes will be more sensitive, and thus more of their images will be crowded. Probabilistic cataloging performs better than existing software in crowded fields and so should be considered when creating photometric pipelines in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era.",2017,Physics,"list(name = ""Stephen K.

192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515,Computing exact p-values for a cross-correlation shotgun proteomics score function.,"The core of every protein mass spectrometry analysis pipeline is a function that assesses the quality of a match between an observed spectrum and a candidate peptide. We describe a procedure for computing exact p-values for the oldest and still widely used score function, SEQUEST XCorr. The procedure uses dynamic programming to enumerate efficiently the full distribution of scores for all possible peptides whose masses are close to that of the spectrum precursor mass. Ranking identified spectra by p-value rather than XCorr significantly reduces variance because of spectrum-specific effects on the score. In combination with the Percolator postprocessor, the XCorr p-value yields more spectrum and peptide identifications at a fixed false discovery rate than Mascot, X!Tandem, Comet, and MS-GF+ across a variety of data sets.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""J.

b5c8ad7c84cbbb807a50ff72d2e219db412120bd,Controlling false discovery rates in factorial experiments with between-subjects and within-subjects tests,"BackgroundThe False Discovery Rate (FDR) controls the expected number of false positives among the positive test results. It is not straightforward how to conduct a FDR controlling procedure in experiments with a factorial structure, while at the same time there are between-subjects and within-subjects factors. This is because there are P-values for different tests in one and the same response along with P-values for the same test and different responses.FindingsWe propose a procedure resulting in a single P-value per response, calculated over the tests of all the factorial effects. FDR control can then be based on the set of single P-values.ConclusionsThe proposed procedure is very easy to apply and is recommended for all designs with factors applied at different levels of the randomization, such as cross-over designs with added between-subjects factors.Trial registrationNCT00959790",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric D.

This problem is closely related to the control of false discovery rates (FDR) in massive hypothesis testing applications, e.g., microarray gene expression analysis. Our methodology is similar to, but improves upon, the existing approach by Ruppert, Nettleton, and Hwang (2007, Biometrics, 63, 483-495). We provide parametric, nonparametric, and semiparametric estimators for the distribution of NCPs, as well as estimates of the FDR and local FDR. In the parametric situation, we assume that the NCPs follow a distribution that leads to an analytically available marginal distribution for the test statistics. In the nonparametric situation, we use convex combinations of basis density functions to estimate the density of the NCPs. A sequential quadratic programming procedure is developed to maximize the penalized likelihood. The smoothing parameter is selected with the approximate network information criterion. A semiparametric estimator is also developed to combine both parametric and nonparametric fits. Simulations show that, under a variety of situations, our density estimates are closer to the underlying truth and our FDR estimates are improved compared with alternative methods. Data-based simulations and the analyses of two microarray datasets are used to evaluate the performance in realistic situations.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""L.

3cfe0b8ee0746c9b4143a3aeb8f2ef1a9f77ed4c,False discovery rate estimation and heterobifunctional cross-linkers,"False discovery rate (FDR) estimation is a cornerstone of proteomics that has recently been adapted to cross-linking/mass spectrometry. Here we demonstrate that heterobifunctional cross-linkers, while theoretically different from homobifunctional cross-linkers, need not be considered separately in practice. We develop and then evaluate the impact of applying a correct FDR formula for use of heterobifunctional cross-linkers and conclude that there are minimal practical advantages.

dcb9973062ec88890f0b86c0b42bbb8a2ed37416,Peri-implant crevicular fluid biomarkers as discriminants of peri-implant health and disease.,"AIM
The objective of this cross-sectional study was to examine the potential of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) analytes to discriminate between peri-implant health and disease using a multi-biomarker approach.


METHODS
We collected PICF samples from the mesio-buccal site of every implant (nÂ =Â 145) from 52 subjects with peri-implantitis and measured the levels of 20 biomarkers using Luminex. We grouped implants and subjects based on the clinical characteristic of the sampled sites and implants into: healthy sites from healthy implants (HH), diseased sites from diseased implants (DD) and healthy sites from diseased implants (HD). The significance of the differences between the HH and DD groups was determined using general linear models controlling for false discovery rate. We used logistic regression to determine the best multi-biomarker models that could distinguish HH from DD subjects and HH from HD subjects.


RESULTS
There were statistically significant differences between HH and DD groups for 12/20 biomarkers. Logistic regression resulted in a 6-biomarker model (Flt-3L, GM-CSF, IL-10, sCD40L, IL-17 and TNFÎ±) that discriminated HH from DD subjects (AUCÂ =Â 0.93) and a 3-biomarker model (IL-17, IL-1ra and vascular endothelial growth factor) that distinguished HH from DD subjects (AUCÂ =Â 0.90).


CONCLUSION
PICF biomarkers might help discriminate peri-implant health from disease.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sabrina Rebollo Zani"", ids = ""47515794""); list(name = ""Kevin Lee Moss"", ids = ""37105051""); list(name = ""Jamil Awad Shibli"", ids = ""6213520""); list(name = ""Eduardo Rolim Teixeira"", ids = ""3069716""); list(name = ""Renata de Oliveira Mairink"", ids = ""11416403""); list(name = ""Tatiana Onuma"", ids = ""38020262""); list(name = ""Magda Feres"", ids = ""6132475""); list(name = ""Ricardo P Teles"", ids = ""4407109"")",7f4e3cbaa9d3d8f072dde149c86028fe9c31ec62; a73d5a1b1b292806912d2cce6e03f1eb81df1e74; 8d08678f71be6b6232c1089a7799085250f4d211; 74da67ad06451d1661188565b7e3f8d70bf98c62; d9fe56b74a9b4aa410797251579eba8dc4fcfe16; c32040d2b2f23914bc6a9416e2557900139eb79f; c82a062a959757241fb4ddfc5967a4c98347675e; dc395d371f56bc3aa5ec2f0951794be754541f72; 8f22f61ca707bb1b97f92381e088e7e455a7d118,,Journal of clinical periodontology,43 10,"

Methods: We successfully genotyped 852 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 97 genes in a cohort of 267 advanced prostate cancer patients at the time of progression to castration recurrence (CRPC) during on-going androgen ablation. Tagging SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) of >5% and r2 â‰¥0.8 were selected from HapMap, NIEHS and Seattle SNP databases. Medical records were queried for cause of death. The primary endpoint of time to prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM), was pre-defined as time from development of CRPC to death from prostate cancer progression. Principle components analysis was used for gene-levels tests, and to account for multiple testing, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR).

2c7bc877184194406c757971ea12c602ccd7cf32,Sample size reassessment for a two-stage design controlling the false discovery rate,Abstract Sample size calculations for gene expression microarray and NGS-RNA-Seq experiments are challenging because the overall power depends on unknown quantities as the proportion of true null hypotheses and the distribution of the effect sizes under the alternative. We propose a two-stage design with an adaptive interim analysis where these quantities are estimated from the interim data. The second stage sample size is chosen based on these estimates to achieve a specific overall power. The proposed procedure controls the power in all considered scenarios except for very low first stage sample sizes. The false discovery rate (FDR) is controlled despite of the data dependent choice of sample size. The two-stage design can be a useful tool to determine the sample size of high-dimensional studies if in the planning phase there is high uncertainty regarding the expected effect sizes and variability.,2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sonja Zehetmayer"", ids = ""3167970""); list(name = ""Alexandra Christine Graf"", ids = ""144143093""); list(name = ""Martin Posch"", ids = ""2470495"")",44ed27d75ee3e1d047c9fa0c5ee9d9344f975518; dd540ea55a1f39644fa8d269988e5876a0538c5f,a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 1156f895a3c2823ff757121b74a9afc5f9552ca8; 4d6b423bda8656d8d46e5fde5ad833f97e278028; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 3430c978d3484cc18a115205dc4382920f3defb9; 1a55c95bf74271d88cd50fec1bf5b1c01022f563; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 7e1733c5c1a7d152bea42d7152f70d1bfacea3ca; 007f017b17db41e96718d3da10459cd431c544f7; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bff1cdc1a299e9f0525b44bf93155ce9d6a19207; 2c34e27fb96ff552d96f45ce3a8cbf62b5bb84bf; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; de8d79f2012457e6acffc1acead260a9ed1bd7fa; 3faaefced4475838e527739bc5181c49f51b30cd; 94cbf53015b9d952fa48503adb8dbdb93c242fdd; 8a1e1f340cd16c0b376aaf6629c4bc3dc5650f33; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f; 3425c617aba26ba7f7c0c77c09ff4e33bf3d26fe; b2b16a9bf487b00f80801ff57c7cbb96503a9e81; 96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 9f859afeaa8f3d62345217e102c965613b69edd4; 652e0fbc0b202ca8deecce939856548120fd3cca; 78e7023e2a11b60307606d571dcb580a0e2c6887,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,14,429 - 442

Frequently, one also runs post-processors such as Percolator to assess the confidence, infer unique peptides, and increase the number of identifications. A recent search engine, MS-GF+, has shown promising results, due to a new and efficient scoring algorithm. However, MS-GF+ provides few statistical estimates about the peptide-spectrum matches, hence limiting the biological interpretation. Here, we enabled Percolator processing for MS-GF+ output and observed an increased number of identified peptides for a wide variety of data sets. In addition, Percolator directly reports p values and false discovery rate estimates, such as q values and posterior error probabilities, for peptide-spectrum matches, peptides, and proteins, functions that are useful for the whole proteomics community.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Viktor Granholm"", ids = ""2867076""); list(name = ""Sang-tae Kim"", ids = ""92271279""); list(name = ""JosÃ© C.

aa950a0e1a34f186e41ba55674d15c9df3b5e5b2,Chemokine growth-regulated oncogene 1 as a putative biomarker for gastric cancer progression.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a heterogeneous disease that is not well detected by current tumor markers. Identifying molecular markers that can predict the potential for tumor progression is important for appropriate individualized therapy. Using the Cancer Metastasis Research Center microarray database (17K cDNA microarray), we identified genes that were differentially expressed between 96 cancer and 98 normal gastric tissues using significant analysis of microarrays. From these, we selected genes that were overexpressed more than twofold in tumor tissues that encode secreted proteins. The selected genes were validated with ELISA using the sera of 96 GC patients and 48 healthy donors. Our first round of selection included 6510 genes that were differentially expressed between 96 cancer and 98 normal gastric tissues with a minimal false discovery rate of 0.005%. Out of those genes, we picked 386 that encoded secreted proteins based on the SOURCE database. Of these genes, we focused on 55 that were overexpressed more than twofold in GC compared to normal tissues. With Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we found 34 genes related to cancer. One in particular, chemokine growth-regulated oncogene 1, CXCL1, has been linked to cancer progression in various cancer types, but not yet to GC. Levels of CXCL1 in serum samples of GC patients were significantly higher compared with healthy donors (P < 0.05). Within GC patients, CXCL1 serum levels increased according to tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. The CXCL1 gene appears to be a candidate marker for GC progression.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jae-Joon Jung"", ids = ""5406934""); list(name = ""Sewon Noh"", ids = ""16196815""); list(name = ""Hei-Cheul Jeung"", ids = ""144270802""); list(name = ""Minkyu Jung"", ids = ""29069630""); list(name = ""Tae Soo Kim"", ids = ""2542995""); list(name = ""Sung Hoon Noh"", ids = ""5735461""); list(name = ""Jae Kyung Roh"", ids = ""1914887""); list(name = ""Hyun Cheol Chung"", ids = ""2648948""); list(name = ""Sun Young Rha"", ids = ""3141474"")",edf51f39ed9c40c4c1c5b02c009d3b31629237d1; 356086d8b219010f24755d92e92c205bb70e4657; eb59e501f8263122bd08168f535660d71930e59a; 228df7f4df3cb927d18f89585124d13da04006ba; fab26d4d39ed324fba6347585efc101705cd42ae; 3a881e681fb533be83ab748e3d63bb420280b719; 213553ca36c062075b5aad85ba665c2b112eef75; 12df8acd9159a875c9e0ee579df8e059b67ab82e; 7d2ccf1a76f0538576ca90656b633f1b8ab4dd1a; a64eddc076296194c0084850d4307f6fbeb55101; 9a33057803116c3fc04b02b061524e12f6f8273a; d39f95609dac09c1a1dfea862867fc1b403fb78d; 3f56018c6a7fbde5ca1856a36c26fc1e21739a38; 0a2d61b7476fcfc8283798ca7f82b7c956a8812c; b709eef1b7b96e308f97756fb0ad1fe881a7598f; b5e9e800d0186a3ca4856baa94f20f03de5dc7b1,,Cancer science,101 10,"

While PACCMIT belongs among the accurate algorithms for predicting conserved microRNA targets in the 3' UTRs, the main contribution of the web server is 2-fold: PACCMIT provides an accurate tool for predicting targets also of weakly conserved or non-conserved microRNAs, whereas PACCMIT-CDS addresses the lack of similar portals adapted specifically for targets in CDS. The web server asks the user for microRNAs and mRNAs to be analyzed, accesses the precomputed P-values for all microRNA-mRNA pairs from a database for all mRNAs and microRNAs in a given species, ranks the predicted microRNA-mRNA pairs, evaluates their significance according to the false discovery rate and finally displays the predictions in a tabular form.

The 'tail strength' is a simple function of the p-values computed for each of the tests. This measure is useful, for example, in assessing the overall univariate strength of a large set of features in microarray and other genomic and biomedical studies. It also has a simple relationship to the false discovery rate of the collection of tests. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the tail strength measure, and illustrate its use on a number of real datasets.",2006,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan E.

8046a9ffadd6108668c6bfcdbbd3c2d18e67a451,Illumina WG-6 BeadChip strips should be normalized separately,"BackgroundIllumina Sentrix-6 Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips are relatively new microarray platforms which have been used in many microarray studies in the past few years. These Chips have a unique design in which each Chip contains six microarrays and each microarray consists of two separate physical strips, posing special challenges for precise between-array normalization of expression values.ResultsNone of the normalization strategies proposed so far for this microarray platform allow for the possibility of systematic variation between the two strips comprising each array. That this variation can be substantial is illustrated by a data example. We demonstrate that normalizing at the strip-level rather than at the array-level can effectively remove this between-strip variation, improve the precision of gene expression measurements and discover more differentially expressed genes. The gain is substantial, yielding a 20% increase in statistical information and doubling the number of genes detected at a 5% false discovery rate. Functional analysis reveals that the extra genes found tend to have interesting biological meanings, dramatically strengthening the biological conclusions from the experiment. Strip-level normalization still outperforms array-level normalization when non-expressed probes are filtered out.ConclusionPlots are proposed which demonstrate how the need for strip-level normalization relates to inconsistent intensity range variation between the strips. Strip-level normalization is recommended for the preprocessing of Illumina Sentrix-6 BeadChips whenever the intensity range is seen to be inconsistent between the strips. R code is provided to implement the recommended plots and normalization algorithms.",2009,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Shi"", ids = ""144854416""); list(name = ""Ashish Banerjee"", ids = ""144205697""); list(name = ""Matthew E.

af4e6e476bc1be009a2f5f8f84d816790e2d55e9,Abstract P3-07-66: Efficacy and gene expression results from eribulin SOLTI1007 neoadjuvant study,"Background: Eribulin is a non-taxane, microtubule dynamics inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. To date, no biomarker exists to prospectively select patients who will derive the maximum benefit from this chemotherapeutic. In this study, we explored, in a prospective clinical trial, the efficacy and the association of pre-treatment expression of mRNA with response in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant eribulin. Results of the HR+ cohort are presented here. Methods: SOLTI1007 is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, exploratory pharmacogenomic study of single agent eribulin as neoadjuvant treatment for stage I-II HER2-negative breast cancer (n=100 HR+ and n=100 HR-negative). Patients received 1.4 mg/m2 of eribulin mesilate intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 21-day cycle, for 4 cycles. Baseline, C2D1, and post-treatment (surgical) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples were collected and gene expression profiled. The PAM50 genes and 492 additional breast cancer-related genes were evaluated using the nCounter platform. Research-based intrinsic subtype and the Risk of Relapse based on subtype and proliferation (ROR-P) were evaluated using the Parker et al. JCO 2009 algorithm. The association of each signature and pathological complete response in the breast (pCRb) was evaluated using univariate logistic regression models. Genes found differentially expressed between screening and surgical specimens were identified using a paired two-class Significance Analysis of Microarrays. Results: 92 evaluable patients were included. Mean age: 55.7. Mean tumor size: 3.7 cm. Mean Ki-67 %: 30.3. The overall pCRb rate was 5.4%. Distribution of the intrinsic subtypes was as follows: Luminal A (n=36, 39.1%), Luminal B (n=34, 37.0%), Basal-like (n=10, 10.9%), Normal-like (n=10, 10.9%) and HER2-enriched (n=2, 2.2%). pCRb rates differed significantly by subtype (p=0.009): Luminal B (11.7%, 4/34), HER2-enriched (50%, 1/2), Luminal A (0%, 0/36), Basal-like (0%, 0/10), Normal-like (0%, 0/10). pCRb rate differed significantly by ROR-P (p=0.018): ROR-P high (16.7%, 4/24), ROR-P med (1.9%, 1/52), ROR-P low (0%, 0/16). Ki67 % did not predict pCRb (p=0.406). Subtype change at surgery occurred in 48.3% (14/29) of Luminal Bs, 13.8% (4/29) of Luminal As, 100% (2/2) of HER2-enriched and 12.5% (1/8) of Basal-like tumors. 78.6% (11/14) of subtype changes in Luminal B disease were to Luminal A. Compared to screening biopsies, 136- and 141- genes were found up- and down-regulated in surgical specimens (False Discovery Rate Conclusions: From a response and biological perspective (i.e. induction of a Luminal A phenotype), patients with Luminal B disease might benefit the most from eribulin therapy. Strategies combining eribulin with endocrine therapy seem warranted in Luminal B breast cancer.

ae01f526e618dc01972c8835d5e97de881705c5a,Bioinformatics Advances to Accelerate Omics Innovations and Applications in the Postgenomic Era.,"We thank Li et al. (2017) for their comments on our study. We are pleased that they found our study useful and appreciate their observations and critical comments. We agree that high-throughput data sets can often be noisy and result in false positives. We also agree that one requires additional filters along with fold change thresholds to identify reliable candidates. One concern as pointed out by Li et al. (2017) was that only selecting miRNAs with greater than twofold change in expression is not reliable and suitable for high-level microarray analysis. However, we indeed used statistical thresholds in addition to the fold change threshold in our analysis. The data were extracted using the Affymetrix miRNA QC tool using the robust multiarray average background correction (Irizarry et al., 2003) and median polish summarization. For each miRNA, background-corrected summarized data were obtained from the Affymetrix miRNA QC tool along with p values. To control the identification of false positives, a two-sample t-test was carried out for every miRNA and multiplicity correction was followed to control the false discovery rate. Candidate miRNAs that were increased or decreased in expression with fold changes â€¡twofold after treatment with cigarette smoke condensate were considered to be differentially regulated. The other concern raised by Li et al. (2017) is lack of further validation of differentially expressed miRNAs by RT-PCR or other methods. We agree that an orthogonal approach to verify results from microarray analysis is a valid approach. However, the sheer number of differentially expressed miRNAs identified in an unbiased global profiling study makes it impractical to validate all of them. We generally employ that strategy when specific molecule/s is/are to be selected for further functional evaluation. As this study was designed to catalog miRNA expression changes and protein expression changes associated with cigarette smoke exposure and provide it as a resource, we have not carried out further validation studies. However, we used mirTarBase (Chou et al., 2016), a database of experimentally proven targets of miRNA to correlate miRNAâ€“protein pairs from our data sets to evaluate inverse relationship in their relative expression pattern. In addition, we also compared our data set with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) miRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with the smoker and nonsmoker patient history (TCGA, https://portal.gdc.cancer .gov/projects/TCGA-LUAD and https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ projects/TCGA-LUSC). This comparison also showed many miRNAs that displayed altered expression in cigarette smoketreated cells in our study, and showed similar expression pattern in tumors from smokers. In summary, we believe that our results in this study using an integrated approach to analyze miRNA and protein expression profiles of NSCLC cells chronically exposed to cigarette smoke provide important insights and a resource of molecular perturbations on a global scale. However, we do acknowledge the suggestions by Li et al. (2017) that candidate molecules should be further verified by orthogonal approaches before planning future experiments to evaluate their functional significance.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jayshree Advani"", ids = ""2954761""); list(name = ""Yashwanth Subbannayya"", ids = ""3349418""); list(name = ""Harsha Gowda"", ids = ""145348679""); list(name = ""Aditi Chatterjee"", ids = ""49926324"")",,2a2cf15cc68628128bbcaeabb6c9cdf8a12c8e59; cc5fd7ab03892cdffeb6cc0a30c8b6a9dbab2bba,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,21 12,"

ec2c2d2198a1baadc228cfc486923c3fc2205870,Detecting anomalies in spatio-temporal flow data by constructing dynamic neighbourhoods,"Abstract In massive spatio-temporal datasets, anomalies that deviate from the global or local distributions are not just useless noise but possibly imply significant changes, surprising patterns, and meaningful insights, and because of this, detection of spatio-temporal anomalies has become an important research hotspot in spatio-temporal data mining. For spatio-temporal flow data (e.g., traffic flow data), the existing anomaly detection methods cannot handle the embedded dynamic characteristic. Therefore, this paper proposes the approach of constructing dynamic neighbourhoods to detect the anomalies in spatio-temporal flow data (called spatio-temporal flow anomalies). In this approach, the dynamic spatio-temporal flow is first modelled based on the real-time attribute values of the flow data, e.g., the velocity of vehicles. The dynamic neighbourhoods are then constructed by considering attribute similarity in the spatio-temporal flow. On this basis, global and local anomalies are detected by employing the idea of the G âŽ statistic and the problem of multiple hypothesis testing is further addressed to control the false discovery rate. The effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approach are demonstrated through comparative experiments on traffic flow data from the central road network of central London for both weekdays and weekends.",2018,Geography; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yan Shi"", ids = ""37743814""); list(name = ""Min Deng"", ids = ""46397265""); list(name = ""Xuexi Yang"", ids = ""3442406""); list(name = ""Jianya Gong"", ids = ""2952204"")",6e8b9f6f2a24e0db9131c9a247b2ef514accec37; e54fd9227b60cce8fa0aa114ae61db63933ca452; 1e46c2ab1edd80f6c2e8a337f239712b0351dd73; 2b4fb26626d3941470495ffec31fe8f1ada24ccb; d6a1d36f62d76d16e73ed10c661e2c6b7ba3eca7,0ccc4b45c9a4fd6f964c3866be1237c5c9ebd81e; f4156a05a47fdeda30638e10954d3674cc056ab6; c05b1c4deec39147c5be2401e6ffed19b45992db; 906ed11d6431ff32e90476c0acade160ab1c9a70; c950cdc704d5020d72b5c87a768d4b52e469f946; aae986112d3b29cd26e290734c9165b395e9afe5; 325c51380d302ccb08c82da3333222875c1f3835; 9f6eb00d28f52ab12559322a23e838978e54bc19; 83135e9b185b816f1270e8353c6a428376615992; 208785bbe8fced31a3aa22aa37cbe28618fbab5c; f727b3506e14b4274118eac213f65a2d2627d5e0; eff6741641700c7c342659442a44342bd8fffcb9; f0fc1e3ba898966af1db532d20e596fd982c0203; 76e469b89dd9221ba11f1a1ce5ab22be24975d10; ca5dcb06d66743c461e6146bdc8800d58ec64377; ab951bcc4c091715e66ed57d54d31cdd5253dcfe; d3224886e7e84d6a4229c1af8e2d701437f51a68; e1afacbd1ecd7f11cb8ca0a283955d8bfa545bd3; 98cb79d9f6ae0757ffb8517c802813db97ae678e; dbe7537b3f911f30d33f0ae225e7662be9478c68; 7cd25c1978e5511f8dc216ad5ecb8b690f48c33c; 88260c73effe41de1ad07f6c99b1c7ab18ab8ddd; 1bbfefcf5754feeeb8ad9a755669684ff0cc3755; 2a841a61aa2b041dc71940333698d8905234be4b; 921851d84be24ded2699a74bbe32065f13248965; b7be60619bdb5a483262139179319828bc7e47d1; 323df11fabf287d60f37afa9225eb761753bb102; 60eef7fad652584249d954869a36b1f4975fa28a; f8810e9ce1bcb2596ecb377c2d3a61ea22a5312b; 262e8926195da195df9736e9d45dc014955168d5; 8830adcf3e47b92bf9bf2dbd13334cc7ff655191; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 826204eee990b891fc319550625de51662870f3b; 7bcde777a12214c717ddda72c7ce7fdd1eaf8e77; caacf440c3660084a6503cb1d0574da96ebd0fb7; 3304bd580504688ec06265c1f4cdc7b94c9c475d; 3c7fca43bad1fe7c1fee34ef4310007a502f2b11; 16a3608ddd0ee149a87e2be4b23908496e36f9b2; 1755460b71cf6d4348144b09c4feeaa0e7c32d9b; ddf549240e9013400a328efd5492f1f880037569,Comput.

The pituitary gland plays a major role in reproductive readiness. A comprehensive understanding of the associated transcriptome changes during peripuberty will aid in the development of treatments and management practices to improve reproductive performance. The objective of this study was to gain understanding of the transcriptome associated with changes preand post-puberty. The transcriptome of pituitary tissue from 4 pre-pubertal beef heifers was compared with that of 4 different post-pubertal beef heifers using individual RNA-seq libraries. Single-end reads were mapped to the Bos taurus reference genome (Btau_4.6.1) using Tophat v2.0.12. In total, 10,489 isoform transcripts pertaining to 10,234 genes were identified and 1,162 isoform transcripts pertaining to 1,149 genes were differentially expressed between post-puberty and pre-puberty pituitary tissue (False Discovery Rate-adjusted P-value <0.05) using Cufflinks v2.2.1. Among the most relevant and significant (false discovery rate adjusted P-value <0.03) genes associated with reproductive maturation were leptin receptor (LEPR) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and endothelin 1 (EDN1). Increments in leptin receptors encoded by LEPR are associated with gonad maturation, the advent of reproductive maturity and fertility. VIP encodes the VIP neuropeptide that among other roles, participates in ovarian development and stimulation of prolactin release under the influence of estrogen. EDN1 encodes the EDN1 neuropeptide that is involved in mechanisms controlling the gonadotropins and prolactin secretion, also inhibiting synthesis of progesterone and premature luteinization of granulosa cells. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes using DAVID identified 4 enriched functional category clusters (enrichment score >2): blood vessels and vasculature development, collagen fibrin and extracellular organization, carbohydrate and hyaluronic acid binding, and transforming growth factor Î² receptor signaling pathway. These categories confirm a wide range of changes associated with beef heifers transitioning from preto post-puberty and suggest potential pharmacological targets.",2015,,"list(name = ""R.

b14d25dc224056b739ba2eac1f2129987de772c3,An initial characterization of the serum phosphoproteome.,"Phosphorylation is a dynamic post-translational protein modification that is the basis of a general mechanism for maintaining and regulating protein structure and function, and of course underpins key cellular processes through signal transduction. In the last several years, many studies of large-scale profiling of phosphoproteins and mapping phosphorylation sites from cultured human cells or tissues by mass spectrometry technique have been published; however, there is little information on general (or global) phosphoproteomic characterization and description of the content of phosphoprotein analytes within the circulation. Circulating phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides could represent important disease biomarkers because of their well-known importance in cellular function, and these analytes frequently are mutated and activated in human diseases such as cancer. Here, we report an initial attempt to characterize the phosphoprotein content of serum. To accomplish this, we developed a method in which phosphopeptides are enriched from digested serum proteins and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using LTQ-Orbitrap (CID) and LTQ-ETD mass spectrometers. With this approach, we identified approximately 100 unique phosphopeptides with stringent filtering criteria and a lower than 1% false discovery rate.",2009,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Weidong Zhou"", ids = ""91936502""); list(name = ""Mark M.

5c5becc796db9bb107d4908f40746d82ccae0fe4,Proportion of non-zero normal means: universal oracle equivalences and uniformly consistent estimators,"Since James and Stein's seminal work, the problem of ""estimating n normal means"" has received plenty of enthusiasm in the statistics community. Recently, driven by the fast expansion of the field of large-scale multiple testing, there has been a resurgence of research interest in the ""n"" normal means problem. The new interest, however, is more or less concentrated on ""testing ""n"" normal means"": to determine simultaneously which means are 0 and which are not. In this setting, the ""proportion"" of the non-zero means plays a key role. Motivated by examples in genomics and astronomy, we are particularly interested in estimating the proportion of non-zero means, i.e. given ""n"" independent normal random variables with individual means ""X"" ""j"" âˆ¼""N""(""Î¼"" ""j"" ,1), ""j""e1,â€¦,""n"", to estimate the proportion ""e"" ""n"" e(1/""n"") nl""j"":""Î¼"" ""j "" /e 0r. We propose a general approach to construct the universal oracle equivalence of the proportion. The construction is based on the underlying characteristic function. The oracle equivalence reduces the problem of estimating the proportion to the problem of estimating the oracle, which is relatively easier to handle. In fact, the oracle equivalence naturally yields a family of estimators for the proportion, which are consistent under mild conditions, uniformly across a wide class of parameters. The approach compares favourably with recent works by Meinshausen and Rice, and Genovese and Wasserman. In particular, the consistency is proved for an unprecedentedly broad class of situations; the class is almost the largest that can be hoped for without further constraints on the model. We also discuss various extensions of the approach, report results on simulation experiments and make connections between the approach and several recent procedures in large-scale multiple testing, including the false discovery rate approach and the local false discovery rate approach.

6544a071b7896f654d38d9b7b3e5404436c34f60,Rapid and accurate peptide identification from tandem mass spectra.,"Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of proteins in a complex biological sample. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We describe a database search program called Crux that reimplements and extends the widely used database search program Sequest. For speed, Crux uses a peptide indexing scheme to rapidly retrieve candidate peptides for a given spectrum. For each peptide in the target database, Crux generates shuffled decoy peptides on the fly, providing a good null model and, hence, accurate false discovery rate estimates. Crux also implements two recently described postprocessing methods: a p value calculation based upon fitting a Weibull distribution to the observed scores, and a semisupervised method that learns to discriminate between target and decoy matches. Both methods significantly improve the overall rate of peptide identification. Crux is implemented in C and is distributed with source code freely to noncommercial users.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher Y. Park"", ids = ""144726224""); list(name = ""Aaron A.

b2d09362f3ecc4ea1541d979188188ea8431cff9,Whole blood microRNA expression may not be useful for screening non-small cell lung cancer,"At least seven studies have suggested that microRNA levels in whole blood can be diagnostic for lung cancer. We conducted a large bi-institutional study to validate this. QiagenÂ® PAXgeneâ„¢ Blood miRNA System was used to collect blood and extract RNA from it for 85 pathologic stage I-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and 76 clinically-relevant controls who had a benign pulmonary mass, or a high risk of developing lung cancer because of a history of cigarette smoking or age >60 years. Cases and controls were similar for age, gender, race, and blood hemoglobin and leukocyte but not platelet levels (0.23 and 0.26 million/Î¼l, respectively; t test P = 0.01). ExiqonÂ® MiRCURYâ„¢ microarrays were used to quantify microRNAs in RNA isolates. Quantification was also performed using Taqmanâ„¢ microRNA reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays for five microRNAs whose lung cancer-diagnostic potential had been suggested in seven published studies. Of the 1,941 human mature microRNAs detectable with the microarray platform, 598 (31%) were identified as expressed and reliably quantified among the study's subjects. However, none of the microRNAs was differentially expressed between cases and controls (P >0.05 at false discovery rate <5% in test using empirical Bayes-moderated t statistics). In classification analyses with leave-one-out internal cross-validation, cases and controls could be identified by microRNA expression with 47% and 50% accuracy with support vector machines and top-scoring pair methods, respectively. Cases and controls did not differ for RT-PCR-based measurements of any of the five microRNAs whose biomarker potential had been suggested by seven previous studies. Additionally, no difference for microRNA expression was noticed in microarray-based microRNA profiles of whole blood of 12 stage IA-IIIB NSCLC cases before and three-four weeks after tumor resection.

Thirty seven specimens of BPH were obtained from symptomatic patients undergoing surgery. RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix Chips containing 54,000 gene expression probes. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using cluster, tree view and significance analysis of Microarrays (SAM) softwares. In an initial unsupervised analysis, our 37 samples clustered hierarchically in two groups of 18 and 19 samples, respectively. Five clinical parameters were statistically different between the two groups: in group 1 compared to group 2, patients had larger prostate glands, had higher PSA level, were more likely to be treated by alpha blocker, to be operated by prostatectomy, and to have major irritative symptoms. The sole independent parameter associated with this dichotome clustering however, was the prostate gland volume. Therefore, the role of prostate volume was explored in a supervised analysis. Gene expression of prostate glands < 60 ml and > 60 ml were compared using SAM and 227 genes were found differentially expressed between the two groups (>2 change and false discovery rate of <5%). Several specific pathways including growth factors genes, cell cycle genes, apoptose genes, inflammation genes, and androgen regulated genes, displayed major differences between small and large prostate glands. Having revised our manuscript No. DMP07-347 entitled "" BPH gene expression profile associated to prostate gland volume "" according to the comments of the two reviewers, we would like to submit the revised version of the manuscript for publication in "" Diagnostic Molecular Pathology "". The corrections have been made as indicated below. All modifications appear in bold font in the revised manuscript. Reviewer #1: BPH is histologically defined as overgrowth of the epithelial and stromal cells of the transition zone and periuretral area. Therefore, BPH area can be identified macroscopically. We did not perform tissue microdissection because, in contrary to prostate cancer, there is no way to identify BPH microscopically. We were not surprised to see that fold changes observed in our analysis were low compared to those found in malignant disease. Indeed, few molecular modifications were expected in BPH as it a subnormal state observed in the majority of old men. Reviewer #2: 1.

Fatty liver is an important complication of obesity; however, regulatory mechanisms mediating altered gene expression patterns have not been identified.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to identify novel transcriptional changes in human liver that could contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation and associated insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.


DESIGN
We evaluated gene expression in surgical liver biopsies from 13 obese (nine with type 2 diabetes) and five control subjects using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. PCR validation was performed in liver biopsies using an additional 16 subjects. We also tested thyroid hormone responses in mice fed chow or high-fat diet.


SETTING
Recruitment was performed in an academic medical center.


PARTICIPANTS
Individuals undergoing elective surgery for obesity or gallstones participated in the study.


RESULTS
The top-ranking gene set, down-regulated in obese subjects, was comprised of genes previously demonstrated to be positively regulated by T(3) in human skeletal muscle (n = 399; P < 0.001; false discovery rate = 0.07). This gene set included genes related to RNA metabolism (SNRPE, HNRPH3, TIA1, and SFRS2), protein catabolism (PSMA1, PSMD12, USP9X, IBE2B, USP16, and PCMT1), and energy metabolism (ATP5C1, COX7C, UQCRB). We verified thyroid hormone regulation of these genes in the liver after injection of C57BL/6J mice with T(3) (100 microg/100 g body weight); furthermore, T(3)-induced increases in expression of these genes were abolished by high-fat diet. In agreement, expression of these genes inversely correlated with liver fat content in humans.


CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that impaired thyroid hormone action may contribute to altered patterns of gene expression in fatty liver.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jussi PihlajamÃ¤ki"", ids = ""113002433""); list(name = ""Tanner Boes"", ids = ""34724497""); list(name = ""Eun-Young Kim"", ids = ""145531543""); list(name = ""Farrell Dearie"", ids = ""7720510""); list(name = ""Brian W.

bf5808513bf1af68d5bc64f9a927b5602c3324be,Degrees of differential gene expression: detecting biologically significant expression differences and estimating their magnitudes,"MOTIVATION
Many methods of identifying differential expression in genes depend on testing the null hypotheses of exactly equal means or distributions of expression levels for each gene across groups, even though a statistically significant difference in the expression level does not imply the occurrence of any difference of biological or clinical significance. This is because a mathematical definition of 'differential expression' as any non-zero difference does not correspond to the differential expression biologists seek. Furthermore, while some current methods account for multiple comparisons in hypothesis tests, they do not accordingly adjust estimates of the degrees to which genes are differentially expressed. Both problems lead to overstating the relevance of findings.


RESULTS
Testing whether genes have relevant differential expression can be accomplished with customized null hypotheses, thereby redefining 'differential expression' in a way that is more biologically meaningful. When such tests control the false discovery rate, they effectively discover genes based on a desired quantile of differential gene expression. Estimation of the degree to which genes are differentially expressed has been corrected for multiple comparisons.

ff959931d50dc9d21a67aa5b8c40f3f3792a248d,Detecting dyads of related individuals in large collections of DNA-profiles by controlling the false discovery rate.,"The search for pairs (dyads) of related individuals in large databases of DNA-profiles has become an increasingly important inference tool in ecology. However, the many, partly dependent, pairwise comparisons introduce statistical issues. We show that the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure is well suited to control for the proportion of false positives, i.e. dyads consisting of unrelated individuals, which under normal circumstances would have been labelled as related individuals. We verify the behaviour of the standard FDR procedure by simulation, demonstrating that the FDR procedure works satisfactory in spite of the many dependent pairwise comparisons involved in an exhaustive database screening. A computer program that implements this method is available online. In addition, we propose to implement a second stage in the procedure, in which additional independent genetic markers are used to identify the false positives. We demonstrate the application of the approach in an analysis of a DNA database consisting of 3300 individual minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) each typed at ten microsatellite loci. Applying the standard procedure with an FDR of 50% led to the identification of 74 putative dyads of 1st- or 2nd-order relatives. However, introducing the second step, which involved additional genotypes at 15 microsatellite loci, revealed that only 21 of the putative dyads can be claimed with high certainty to be true dyads.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hans J.

8781ff606a5deae82e1660201d7478c34e3d7191,Whole blood transcriptome analysis in ewes fed with hemp seed supplemented diet,"The hemp plant (Cannabis sativa L.) has a long tradition of being used for many different purposes such as industry, medicine and nutrition. In particular, because hemp seed (HS) is rich in oil protein and considerable amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals that are particularly suitable also for animal nutrition. Different studies have evaluated HS on qualitative and quantitative properties of livestock products but as of today, nobody has investigated the molecular pathway behind HS supplementation in farm animals. Thus, in this study, we will report the first RNA sequencing of the whole-blood transcriptome of ewes fed either with a controlled diet (CTR, nâ€‰=â€‰5) or with a diet supplemented with 5% of hemp seed (HSG, nâ€‰=â€‰5). Applying a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and a log2FC either higher than 0.5 or lower than âˆ’0.5, we identified 314 differentially regulated genes in the HS-supplemented group compared to the CTR group. Several genes encoding for different subunits belonging to the complex I, II, III, IV and ATP-synthase were up-regulated making oxidative phosphorylation (FDR: 3.05e-19) and thermogenesis (FDR: 2.17e-16) the highest up-regulated pathways in our study. Moreover, we found up-regulation in different genes involved in lactose biosyntheses such as GALK1 and PGM1 and, as a result, we observed a statistically higher lactose percentage in the HSG group (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). These results indicate that HS supplementation positively affects the energy production pathway in lactating ewes conferring them also more resistance to adverse climatic conditions such as low temperature.

956367e977afc14ae84377a74efd951f474a1fde,Renal artery denervation affects the circulating microRNA profile in patients with resistant arterial hypertension,"Background: Small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miR) control mRNA signaling at the level of post-transcriptional regulation. Several miR are regulated in arterial hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy, as demonstrated in animal models and recently also in patient studies. Renal denervation (RDN) reduces blood pressure, left ventricular mass and improves diastolic dysfunction in patients with resistant hypertension. The effect of RDN on circulating miR expression is unknown.

Methods and results: RDN reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure from 168.4Â±4.5 to 144.0Â±5.5 mmHg and 88.0Â±3.1 to 76.8Â±2.4 mmHg (p<0.001), respectively. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood plasma of 20 patients before and 6 months after RDN. RNA was subjected to miR profiling using Agilent 8x60k Homo sapiens microRNA v16 microarrays. Following quantile normalization of the data and determination of differential expression (corrected for multiple testing) we found 34 differentially expressed miRs at a false discovery rate < 5%. 26 miRs were found to be expressed at a higher level following RD, while 3 miRs were expressed at a lower level. Pathway analysis (KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) on the target genes of the downregulated miR suggested MAP kinase and insulin signaling pathways to be affected.

Next, we analyzed a quantitative correlation between unique miR and several clinical parameters using regression analysis. MicroRNA expression was related to the ratio (post/pre RD) of left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LV mass index, LVMI) and function, as measured by echocardiography. We found the ratio 43 miRs to be positively and the ratio of 17 miRs to be inversely correlated to the ratio of LVMI change. The change of 18 miRs was negatively correlated to change in longitudinal strain determined by speckle tracking echocardiography. The change in 8 miRs was positively correlated to the change in left atrial volume index. Real-time RT-PCR was used to verify selected targets both in the original 20 patients undergoing array analysis and in an independent validation group consisting of further 20 patients.

Conclusion: Renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension substantially influences plasma microRNA expression profile. Changes in specific miR s showed a quantitative correlation with changes in blood pressure and left-ventricular mass. These data identify potential marker miRs and provide insights into miR signaling in hypertension.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephan Schirmer"", ids = ""144820830""); list(name = ""T.C.T.

Acyl-carnitines involved in bioenergetic pathways provide potential biomarker targets for identifying early changes and onset characteristics in subjects with schizophrenia. We measured 29 acyl-carnitine levels within well-characterized plasma samples of adults with schizophrenia and healthy controls using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Subjects with schizophrenia were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. A total of 225 subjects with schizophrenia and 175 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled and 156 subjects completed the 8-week follow-up. With respect to plasma acyl-carnitines, the individuals with schizophrenia at baseline showed significantly higher levels of C4-OH (C3-DC) and C16:1, but lower concentrations of C3, C8, C10, C10:1, C10:2, C12, C14:1-OH, C14:2, and C14:2-OH when compared with healthy controls after controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and drinking. For the comparison between pretreatment and posttreatment subjects, all detected acyl-carnitines were significantly different between the two groups. Only the concentration of C3 and C4 were increased after selection by variable importance in projection (VIP) value >1.0 and false discovery rate (FDR) q value <0.05. A panel of acyl-carnitines were selected for the ability to differentiate subjects of schizophrenia at baseline from controls, pre- from post-treatment, and posttreatment from controls. Our data implicated acyl-carnitines with abnormalities in cellular bioenergetics of schizophrenia. Therefore, acyl-carnitines can be potential targets for future investigations into their roles in the pathoetiology of schizophrenia.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bing Cao"", ids = ""2569365""); list(name = ""Dongfang Wang"", ids = ""47859405""); list(name = ""Zihang Pan"", ids = ""8614110""); list(name = ""Elisa Brietzke"", ids = ""4374437""); list(name = ""Roger S.

c9791a23390bdf2ffc52305a67c43ab2dbc74bef,COSMOS: accurate detection of somatic structural variations through asymmetric comparison between tumor and normal samples,"An important challenge in cancer genomics is precise detection of structural variations (SVs) by high-throughput short-read sequencing, which is hampered by the high false discovery rates of existing analysis tools. Here, we propose an accurate SV detection method named COSMOS, which compares the statistics of the mapped read pairs in tumor samples with isogenic normal control samples in a distinct asymmetric manner. COSMOS also prioritizes the candidate SVs using strand-specific read-depth information. Performance tests on modeled tumor genomes revealed that COSMOS outperformed existing methods in terms of F-measure. We also applied COSMOS to an experimental mouse cell-based model, in which SVs were induced by genome engineering and gamma-ray irradiation, followed by polymerase chain reaction-based confirmation. The precision of COSMOS was 84.5%, while the next best existing method was 70.4%.

One of the statistical methods applied in these analyses is called false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. In this study, we compared the FDR theories behind the statistical software of Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) and Golden Helix using a database obtained from a methadone maintenance treatment cohort in Taiwan. The association analyses were performed between the delta opioid receptor (OPRD1) of seven SNPs from rs2236861 to rs760588, or four SNPs from rs2236861 to rs419335, and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in both genotypes and allele types. In general linear model (GLM) of association analyses, SNP rs797397 had the most significant association with DBP among seven or four SNPs of both genotype (p=0.0012) and allele type (p=0.0004) using SAS and Golden Helix programs. The genotype and allele type of this SNP had 0.0039 and 0.0018 FDR, respectively after Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure analyses using SAS program, and had 0.0083 and 0.0027 FDR, respectively after the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) analyses using Golden Helix program in seven SNPs. The genotype and allele type of this SNP had 0.0022 and 0.0015 FDR, respectively after BH analyses and 0.0047 and 0.0015 FDR, respectively after pFDR analyses in four SNPs. In summary, the pFDR had less significant level than BH procedure in the most significant GLM associations SNP in both genotypes and allele types at seven and four numbers of SNPs. The FDR values were the same in both BH and pFDR multiple corrections in the allele type of four SNPs. The BH procedure in SAS provided a more consistent FDR in both genotype and allele type of multiple correction analyses despite the number of SNPs.",2013,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yao-Sheng Chang"", ids = ""3344605""); list(name = ""Hsiao-Huei Tsou"", ids = ""13160700""); list(name = ""Sheng-Chang Wang"", ids = ""3486696""); list(name = ""Chiu-Ping Fang"", ids = ""3474055""); list(name = ""Yu-Li Liu"", ids = ""3000284""); list(name = ""Ing-Kang Ho"", ids = ""2526833"")",,,2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB),,154-159
f30dbfe66b8b2b42dcf8001a48acd73405631e22,Dissection of Insertionâ€“Deletion Variants within Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Wood Formation in Populus,"Short insertions and deletions (InDels) are one of the major genetic variants and are distributed widely across the genome; however, few investigations of InDels have been conducted in long-lived perennial plants. Here, we employed a combination of RNA-seq and population resequencing to identify InDels within differentially expressed (DE) genes underlying wood formation in a natural population of Populus tomentosa (435 individuals) and utilized InDel-based association mapping to detect the causal variants under additive, dominance, and epistasis underlying growth and wood properties. In the present paper, 5,482 InDels detected from 629 DE genes showed uneven distributions throughout all 19 chromosomes, and 95.9% of these loci were diallelic InDels. Seventy-four InDels (positive false discovery rate q â‰¤ 0.10) from 68 genes exhibited significant additive/dominant effects on 10 growth and wood-properties, with an average of 14.7% phenotypic variance explained. Potential pleiotropy was observed in one-third of the InDels (representing 24 genes). Seven genes exhibited significantly differential expression among the genotypic classes of associated InDels, indicating possible important roles for these InDels. Epistasis analysis showed that overlapping interacting genes formed unique interconnected networks for each trait, supporting the putative biochemical links that control quantitative traits. Therefore, the identification and utilization of InDels in trees will be recognized as an effective marker system for molecular marker-assisted breeding applications, and further facilitate our understanding of quantitative genomics.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chenrui Gong"", ids = ""6065519""); list(name = ""Qingzhang Du"", ids = ""3873809""); list(name = ""Jianbo Xie"", ids = ""134233706""); list(name = ""Mingyang Quan"", ids = ""31655661""); list(name = ""Beibei Chen"", ids = ""1901145""); list(name = ""Deqiang Zhang"", ids = ""39687013"")",4cef48eb568ae0a18aeac3c3d9a3ea38fa2c43c6; e58de5736fe98cc6ffd4dac522c80a43cf3c8587,ad4fc7dbe12eaf6bf577568f3a06ec9ed4b2d0f2; 345f9b75feb9bbe6c22d60503917ff424d0df26b; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; fb6b4ae111b331608004d88fd07c8d9affbbb593; 0e68beebb4c7ccbd9d3b410b84481ae48908d029; e73de676ac6172e05f6e074da971b18a608305fa; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; 97c5e82ac668840d423e028df06d6cc784c9c12f; 2a84453518d7bfe8ec45d8995efbcef8fc2fa60d; 32aeeefe6af21896c348c11132c1cf6cc7214c0a; 6a4e07bb435e92b1f23e32c83770c3f90c5ece76; 959c9521e611b07c7caece519267abd27e67bb13; b562f5c1c967d5582e72ccbbb7b1698e97f051f9; cdfb94c61ed87882b74d1c3a4d341375f1f0a63e; 27e71871a687410c374e8b1a37c877873fe2518b; f5f95d9c4b60e1aabee718991e1e9ac9de826bf6; a099324b0962edd5b94c889a4bf99a7afae2f33b; 6025e53713561142d431e2ae59c2c6096302c9d0; 342b4dc18595a8975e8b7188a0e40c221ce925e1; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; 7b45374f8e1e14f10867ba8fcbde6b4b17e82582; caacbbff68d0fa024025df5ca893db8449201957; 55354ab4071212b9acc34fcadb9ba2749b87620a; e6137c2b39704ea7640b607efedd701338ae3bdb; 90a47604be76ff0bc687a0984d93a1b814acc8a9; c015c6994de9b2ea4a38652df1c56856fafe0887; e00ae5c3741f5d9e96a7b460d5a3809f13cabd93; ec14af8dfb1b727a685e068a7769ec6f45b5f759; 4105168f874e78af8e2c4b528323c1761a698a7c; 80fb0154dabd8fb2bc2c41df04bc6224add06ef8; 7a2bfb64ab67dbc8233a1e272aa16abbffeab3cb; 40bdbd56adb06b50f67ad94b749816d5c1c597cf; e45b5618cd006ae07125767d446933e4d91cb361; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 430bea7e8fb17bd9ff4ac6448ffc8d9661a95488; 6d603215c51f816bbaf3eb7eccc05b2a19c037ca; 79cfbd1d2bf2194cf1289c04c12f341394053aa6; 712a9dc64ecec66a936a975d73c4cda445fde7da; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; 1417b979e2dfe4e1c8cd2df724d296450f26f99f; 218ad5bbd5fd84a28e3e02d28b93d5bf6feea90f; 28410253f85aa137865411f83dfdd156a7df8fef; 6f30e0023cbcf9bc95bd811ad4fef9bccba89322,Frontiers in Plant Science,8,

The resulting inference procedure is doubly robust for both the predictive and the changepoint (CP) posterior, with linear time and constant space complexity. We provide a construction for exponential models and demonstrate it on the Bayesian Linear Regression model. In so doing, we make two additional contributions: Firstly, we make GBI scalable using Structural Variational approximations that are exact as $\beta \to 0$. Secondly, we give a principled way of choosing the divergence parameter $\beta$ by minimizing expected predictive loss on-line. We offer the state of the art and improve the False Discovery Rate of CPs by more than 80% on real world data.",2018,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jeremias Knoblauch"", ids = ""41094094""); list(name = ""Jack Jewson"", ids = ""51041989""); list(name = ""Theodoros Damoulas"", ids = ""1760294"")",0e877cbfdfc521e64c8da4c4aaa234583f009c62; bf9bee50d49cc40858a4959be378cf14ae5018d8; 71d572755864856577e0f590ad3942f5113b6d55; 8790396a81529825b5c31c9f1a40f671d8ae50b9; bd9b46c4a007935aefe7c88f71e3481a58657156; 7820d3262d111b8d994219f49963e5428ff8f304; e6cd019a70bd8befc98e8c7156a88d61f963f99f; e55e5185644d37043354f7d8eefac4dc30119985; 8138559d450d42ce24bf3c113568c411864a6854; cb1b29df16528cbbfeb03cf04dca83125208f825; 64bd7faa0044a240cfe3103554f2bd92f0049544,3898467f0a84e6fca8a7e40258bc55bae195d0de; 9cacd41e4fbe518436877a6f1b24982099216e46; c22f5064ce4ac5e8473ac465b3b0e59aa69298bf; 16f92d9a90c2c1b744db284673532c208ca0c41d; 24865152648081fa29bf5e3c6c77027e1d2b0205; 203744a1191ea57405f87636b9997a2910db4931; c0aee70d61bb6528cf400eeb7b2670e45924b58a; e5d39a09e84e83c6bc08dc35779b290480b9a99d; e6d2588d205ab64b4db7b1d5f2b01d9862a4a243; ee605880a47b72b61406d1b38273c31426108b7d; 0421c69be8820970c8d6b2a86fa0120963d29884; 803f5fc50765fa2ac1c72659dca02f285fa48d4b; 242a930f46a79c683d4e06e8176d9cee3d631f40; 2fdd03f41230ab5a8b78bc0e68c2ba7a6e20a187; 097ff94cc3cbc5ddb1cf964539c476ce5815f942; 92fff676dc28d962e79c0450531ebba12a341896; 3a4d68714562ea4ea88ef03451581634a3968b11; 5fd6376dff241345ffd5fe73b497459b3ff7903a; e4b28d5d4a2293907d844d62c323ad86ef29c43d; 2a3432758e603d75500e206839df2d4218a9fb80; 05f7ea1c793f939beb5a60bca9b2a04d40c1615d; d46145272574cf5bc74d6f712ad8b0cb0fcd9eee; 2fc26ef1f69677bad6c64f8bb5587f18a1c2e374; e2c130b85da00d89ff08a5cae1f8632e078a5c8d; ddf53d558d4a8d45486b15c670b325a4da7ec78e; 56dffa9f39599d2ca97ffe78a06088638a67edc7; 1dc6846ec5744b29667420cda325c1e525738494; 07cd685010beac86d45a53f1ff4c72072862b85f; 2f8dd3f29a4ee078eb4ba9c872ba31ce55ee979f; f780c1f16a73b4e9d160ba03a23f3c6bf3e6b42b; f3bbf2c50c2237004300e78f92c8929925d399eb; 97fcee01d9777372a3d8966ab7cd4c17e3a6a5ca; 89227d150b531658bbcd23a5b02c8d147b96ed10; db1a81f3eaaf61586ce924bc7e4e10425ad6b3ac; b8ac267a463e28462df8c0fd6f0a24c4defc06c8; b516fc57f3d7ad3a770ffec7fb364eeb7776963c; 2413bbedd647232bd6b0b0eaeb2084d5370a362d; 029afb49016184145cbab60f8a6b04d2dc37c32b; 43c05444fbc239321f6676f3cd539cac34fde7b8; 7eb526b0cfe74b3346d37d9ba8ad9b2a63588cf3; b288e33565921c8d71818482d4a023d01de65878; 688581bc42b30458f8ac951ea31d6fe5e4df164a; f59023cc50582bd46e07d4579c0c9dbfc7cf6281; 3abf17191ee668eb8b1a076b45c404e380eb7a05; 783d960fba6659481e7e22853a73c829dfd58b5a; 988b76f42ee8ac68f14b1113b16c2a9f6f025636; ddb4031522b3184b9401faef28bb5b1899174102,,,64-75
81bfc62e6eec440c664c63e0ac9527941a86d0f6,"Changes in Inflammation and Immune Activation With Atazanavir-, Raltegravir-, Darunavir-Based Initial Antiviral Therapy: ACTG 5260s.","BACKGROUND
It is unclear whether the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (RAL) reduces inflammation and immune activation compared with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PIs).


METHODS
In a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that included 328 human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-naive participants were randomized to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) plus atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r), darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r), or RAL. A total of 234 participants (71%) with HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL by week 24 were included. Plasma biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation that were analysed included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), GlycA, D-dimer, soluble CD14 (sCD14), sCD163, and sIL-2r; blood cellular markers included %CD38+DR+ of T-cell subsets and %CD14+CD16+ and%CD14(dim)CD16+ monocyte subsets. Changes from baseline were examined at earlier (24 or 48 weeks) and later (96 weeks) time points, with 95% confidence intervals on fold-change. Pairwise treatment groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests, with P values adjusted for false discovery rate control.


RESULTS
Changes in biomarkers varied by regimen during the 96 weeks of follow-up as follows: hsCRP declined with ATV/r and RAL, IL-6 declined only with RAL, and GLycA decreased in all groups. D-dimer declined with ATV/r and DRV/r and was unchanged with RAL. Markers of T-cell activation and sCD163 (but not sCD14 and CD14-+CD16+) declined in all groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite some differences in specific markers of inflammation and immune activation between the antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, we found no consistent evidence that the reduction of inflammation and immune activation with ART initiation was different between RAL and PI-based regimens.

2413a8d5b654f10091db8a5d55ca86df589b9460,A maximum average power test for large scale time-course data of counts with applications to RNA-Seq analysis,"Experiments that longitudinally collect RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data can provide transformative insights in biology research by revealing dynamic patterns of genes. Such experiments create great demands for new analytic approaches to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes based on large-scale time-course count data. Existing methods, however, are sub-optimal with respect to power and may lack theoretical justification. Furthermore, most existing tests are designed to distinguish among conditions based on overall differential patterns across time, though in practice, a variety of composite hypotheses are of more scientificc interest. Lastly, some current methods may fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper, we propose a new model and testing procedure to address the above issues simultaneously. Specifically, conditional on a latent Gaussian mixture with evolving means, we model the data by negative binomial distributions. Motivated by Storey (2007) and Hwang and Liu (2010), we introduce a general testing framework based on the proposed model and show that the proposed test enjoys the optimality property of maximum average power. The test allows not only identification of traditional DE genes but also testing of a variety of composite hypotheses of biological interest. We establish the identifiability of the proposed model, implement the proposed method via efficient algorithms, and demonstrate its good performance via simulation studies. The procedure reveals interesting biological insights when applied to data from an experiment that examines the effect of varying light environments on the fundamental physiology of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.",2019,,"list(name = ""Wen Zhou"", ids = ""1388837188"")",,,,,
95fa89f33623a344d172b03520e0906c10dfe592,Modeling gene expression regulatory networks with the sparse vector autoregressive model,"BackgroundTo understand the molecular mechanisms underlying important biological processes, a detailed description of the gene products networks involved is required. In order to define and understand such molecular networks, some statistical methods are proposed in the literature to estimate gene regulatory networks from time-series microarray data. However, several problems still need to be overcome. Firstly, information flow need to be inferred, in addition to the correlation between genes. Secondly, we usually try to identify large networks from a large number of genes (parameters) originating from a smaller number of microarray experiments (samples). Due to this situation, which is rather frequent in Bioinformatics, it is difficult to perform statistical tests using methods that model large gene-gene networks. In addition, most of the models are based on dimension reduction using clustering techniques, therefore, the resulting network is not a gene-gene network but a module-module network. Here, we present the Sparse Vector Autoregressive model as a solution to these problems.ResultsWe have applied the Sparse Vector Autoregressive model to estimate gene regulatory networks based on gene expression profiles obtained from time-series microarray experiments. Through extensive simulations, by applying the SVAR method to artificial regulatory networks, we show that SVAR can infer true positive edges even under conditions in which the number of samples is smaller than the number of genes. Moreover, it is possible to control for false positives, a significant advantage when compared to other methods described in the literature, which are based on ranks or score functions. By applying SVAR to actual HeLa cell cycle gene expression data, we were able to identify well known transcription factor targets.ConclusionThe proposed SVAR method is able to model gene regulatory networks in frequent situations in which the number of samples is lower than the number of genes, making it possible to naturally infer partial Granger causalities without any a priori information. In addition, we present a statistical test to control the false discovery rate, which was not previously possible using other gene regulatory network models.",2007,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""AndrÃ© Fujita"", ids = ""2334018"");

b41fe12d0601922539100d93c3e60510f114cc0d,Comprehensive Cytokine Profiling of Patients with Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis Treated with Midostaurin,"Background: Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) comprises a group of hematologic neoplasms primarily driven by the oncogenic KIT D816V mutation. Morbidity and mortality relate to organ damage caused by neoplastic mast cell infiltration and mast cell mediator symptoms. Midostaurin, an oral multikinase/KIT inhibitor, produced reversion of organ damage in 60-70% of AdvSM patients (Gotlib et al, NEJM, 2016; DeAngelo et al, Leukemia, 2018), which was associated with decreases in bone marrow mast cell burden, serum tryptase levels, and splenomegaly in the majority of patients. Similar to myelofibrosis (MF) patients treated with JAK inhibitors, midostaurin improves disease symptoms and quality of life (Gotlib et al, NEJM, 2016). We conducted a cytokine profiling study to better understand the biologic effects of midostaurin in this patient population. Methods: Plasma cytokine levels were analyzed in 19 patients with AdvSM (2 aggressive SM, 10 SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and 7 with mast cell leukemia) treated with midostaurin 100 mg twice daily. Seventeen patients were treated on the phase II investigator-initiated trial (DeAngelo et al,Leukemia, 2018), and two were treated on a compassionate-use basis. Cytokine levels were compared to 10 patients with MF (primary MF [n=4]; post PV/ET MF [n=6]), treated with JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib, fedratinib, or momelotinib) and 10 healthy patients whose age range matched the SM group. Plasma samples were obtained pretreatment, and after 4-8 weeks of therapy. Each patient sample was evaluated for 62 cytokines using a Luminex assay (eBioscience) performed at the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPLS-DA) was used to identify the most predictive cytokines from the expression data that help classify patient samples based on disease states, and SPLS regression was used to identify cytokines correlated with survival (Rohart et al, mixOmics. R package version 6.3.2). Overall survival was calculated from the time of initiation of midostaurin to time of death. Results: Plasma levels of several cytokines were higher at baseline in AdvSM and MF patients compared to healthy controls (Fig 1A-B). In patients with AdvSM and MF, pretreatment levels of leptin (false discovery rate (FDR) Conclusions: Cytokine expression profiling can distinguish patients with AdvSM or MF from healthy controls. Compared to the use of JAK inhibitors in MF, midostaurin9s activity in AdvSM appears less related to reversion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Investigation of a larger cohort of patients is needed to determine whether such analyses of plasma cytokines will provide added value to new scoring prognostic systems of AdvSM that incorporate clinical and molecular data.

cb4dbdf0c95c0b186ad7aac9d86f3d35094fc432,A Bayesian model for classifying all differentially expressed proteins simultaneously in 2D PAGE gels,"BackgroundTwo-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) is commonly used to identify differentially expressed proteins under two or more experimental or observational conditions. Wu et al (2009) developed a univariate probabilistic model which was used to identify differential expression between Case and Control groups, by applying a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to each protein on a 2D PAGE. In contrast to commonly used statistical approaches, this model takes into account the two possible causes of missing values in 2D PAGE: either (1) the non-expression of a protein; or (2) a level of expression that falls below the limit of detection.ResultsWe develop a global Bayesian model which extends the previously described model. Unlike the univariate approach, the model reported here is able treat all differentially expressed proteins simultaneously. Whereas each protein is modelled by the univariate likelihood function previously described, several global distributions are used to model the underlying relationship between the parameters associated with individual proteins. These global distributions are able to combine information from each protein to give more accurate estimates of the true parameters. In our implementation of the procedure, all parameters are recovered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. The 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals for the marginal posterior distributions are used to determine whether differences in protein expression are due to differences in mean expression intensities, and/or differences in the probabilities of expression.ConclusionsSimulation analyses showed that the global model is able to accurately recover the underlying global distributions, and identify more differentially expressed proteins than the simple application of a LRT. Additionally, simulations also indicate that the probability of incorrectly identifying a protein as differentially expressed (i.e., the False Discovery Rate) is very low.

23708f76da2334ddd896e870ed299771eba4acec,Estimating the Contribution of Proteasomal Spliced Peptides to the HLA-I Ligandome,"Spliced peptides are short protein fragments spliced together in the proteasome by peptide bond formation. True estimation of the contribution of proteasome-spliced peptides (PSPs) to the global Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) ligandome is critical. A recent study suggested that PSPs contribute up to 30% of the HLA ligandome. We performed a thorough reanalysis of the reported results using multiple computational tools and various validation steps and concluded that only a fraction of the proposed PSPs passes the quality filters. To better estimate the actual number of PSPs, we present an alternative workflow. We performed de-novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de-novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de-novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a FDR of 1%. We find that maximally 2-4% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules. However, it remains to be shown how many of these potential PSPs actually originate from proteasomal splicing events.

5b1ea4edf6e59d335ebff7cba28a5622456a23ea,Uncertainty Assessment and False Discovery Rate Control in High-Dimensional Granger Causal Inference,"Causal inference among high-dimensional time series data proves an important research problem in many fields. While in the classical regime one often establishes causality among time series via a concept known as â€œGranger causality,â€ existing approaches for Granger causal inference in high-dimensional data lack the means to characterize the uncertainty associated with Granger causality estimates (e.g., p-values and confidence intervals). We make two contributions in this work. First, we introduce a novel asymptotically unbiased Granger causality estimator with corresponding test statistics and confidence intervals to allow, for the first time, uncertainty characterization in high-dimensional Granger causal inference. Second, we introduce a novel method for false discovery rate control that achieves higher power in multiple testing than existing techniques and that can cope with dependent test statistics and dependent observations.

566d062c772f443638d6e260dca7791dacbe3567,Act-Frequency Signatures of the Big Five.,"The traditional focus of work on personality and behavior has tended toward ""major outcomes"" such as health or antisocial behavior, or small sets of behaviors observable over short periods in laboratories or in convenience samples. In a community sample, we examined a wide set (400) of mundane, incidental or ""every day"" behavioral acts, the frequencies of which were reported over the past year. Using an exploratory methodology similar to genomic approaches (relying on the False Discovery Rate) revealed 26 prototypical acts for Intellect, 24 acts for Extraversion, 13 for Emotional Stability, nine for Conscientiousness, and six for Agreeableness. Many links were consistent with general intuition-for instance, low Conscientiousness with work and procrastination. Some of the most robust associations, however, were for acts too specific for a priori hypothesis. For instance, Extraversion was strongly associated with telling dirty jokes, Intellect with ""loung[ing] around [the] house without clothes on"", and Agreeableness with singing in the shower. Frequency categories for these acts changed with markedly non-linearity across Big Five Z-scores.

f76398dcde5c88ec607503d438d6967875cf7fe4,Estimation of false discovery proportion under general dependence,"MOTIVATION
Wide-scale correlations between genes are commonly observed in gene expression data, due to both biological and technical reasons. These correlations increase the variability of the standard estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). We highlight the false discovery proportion (FDP, instead of the FDR) as the suitable quantity for assessing differential expression in microarray data, demonstrate the deleterious effects of correlation on FDP estimation and propose an improved estimation method that accounts for the correlations.


METHODS
We analyse the variation pattern of the distribution of test statistics under permutation using the singular value decomposition. The results suggest a latent FDR model that accounts for the effects of correlation, and is statistically closer to the FDP. We develop a procedure for estimating the latent FDR (ELF) based on a Poisson regression model.


RESULTS
For simulated data based on the correlation structure of real datasets, we find that ELF performs substantially better than the standard FDR approach in estimating the FDP. We illustrate the use of ELF in the analysis of breast cancer and lymphoma data.

4d49b7e12d5ccff0cd5224b1e001269a1c7de300,"Muscle atrophy, pain, and damage in bed rest reduced by resistive (vibration) exercise.","UNLABELLED
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a short-duration (5-6 min, 3 dÂ·wk) resistive exercise program with (RVE) or without (RE) whole-body vibration in reducing muscle atrophy in the lower limb during prolonged inactivity when compared with that in an inactive control group.


METHODS
As part of the second Berlin BedRest Study, 24 male subjects underwent 60 d of head-down tilt bed rest. Using magnetic resonance imaging, muscle volumes of the individual muscles of the lower limb were calculated before and at various intervals during and after bed rest. Pain levels and markers of muscle damage were also evaluated during and after bed rest. Adjustment of P values to guard against false positives was performed via the false discovery rate method.


RESULTS
On the ""intent-to-treat"" analysis, RE reduced atrophy of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, soleus, vasti, tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, and flexor digitorum longus (P â‰¤ 0.045 vs control group) and RVE reduced atrophy of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius and tibialis posterior (P â‰¤ 0.044). Pain intensity reports after bed rest were lower in RE at the foot (P â‰¤ 0.033) and whole lower limb (P = 0.01) and in RVE at the thigh (P â‰¤ 0.041), lower leg (P â‰¤ 0.01), and whole lower limb (P â‰¤ 0.036). Increases in sarcomere-specific creatine kinase after bed rest were less in RE (P = 0.020) and RVE (P = 0.020). No differences between RE and RVE were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, a short-duration RVE or RE can be effective in reducing the effect of prolonged bed rest on lower extremity muscle volume loss during bed rest and muscle damage and pain after bed rest.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tanja Miokovic"", ids = ""4399548""); list(name = ""Gabriele Armbrecht"", ids = ""35643588""); list(name = ""Ulf Gast"", ids = ""34686036""); list(name = ""Rainer Rawer"", ids = ""4718732""); list(name = ""Heinz Juergen Roth"", ids = ""47188785""); list(name = ""Martin Runge"", ids = ""47823108""); list(name = ""Dieter Felsenberg"", ids = ""2381379""); list(name = ""Daniel L BelavÃ½"", ids = ""3353250"")",a0b283d7d7313397fd7534772faffb0a055ff814; 87efb03ca04cb27e89ea7bc677bc0e1a5bac555c; c27ca2ebdd3032f2dab90bd9d208aad47a73ca2e; c7c1ec5ebd7069a46379c6acf1b342d8b7972f83; 2a1b7745e1388f3b01113037587b7b329077d1a2; 3e8aff1861cf5e39c9ade013653baf04828c4c90; 5d3b7bfeb74e3a0b32f79972e72f11ad8a13864a; e864660948791054d3b65c2ae8e641da3f1684bb; dafb9c9c2cb5f260473d20df41ff8009d821ba84; a6fe1aa88861e8165a0799b6672775b68db9af93; 4615cd86fbf0a9278a7deed0f8cb5907225d9f49; 0e87dab00dcb70d5372c0655470e5f99f760e722,0879414ea5dc291e155c636289d85747e7b8015b; 34f3877c84af60d0b1029145a6e6ff7bbad6ad76; b54e2c788fab5ccccc4179b8788eb348ed53c4af; 51f96eb2bf403f69fb5d0e15365e4c652445ec5e; 4ddac97cd3182532a86d21c3f4c25e14b5bcae19; 38bcfcd9388c8f808170e16964dd7275a5d3b8b6; 487c147cc309b4373e8d7f57265302d619004901; 98495a876d4f70a4f651ccbf4e49e8d42f646239; c3f8db9aa970f963b5ec42b09a77367f78a54612; d75cb0397bfc7e512f174b2e1d91947070d2e725; eca1853cc9c4e98e4f53dae01f2d52fc342d7b93; 5f9c5829db6b17f4f6e430ac1231952b1607bf3b; e15de541bb87c5168538d238fd443da8a56b21e3; a75ead484856e4464568b2fb7ccd17702ae65754; 66989df113854396922746f3455cca2cc78ea908; 545fc6a4550ce641985261359c3217fa92f49286; 1f5350a2cc73d5f43ff92ea78dce25355141ded2; ef9bdecd03aa90e974014b484eecbcf2a54dc052; f14901c30636a40fd32002c9ef8e95359bedecfe; cff622cedeac536b28017a7a14160a4b3b197725; f33e372f794d23f8ef4f77d8eca7cd6650a40125; c01bc0929a863e6d0aa95e3346fc5fd7b5492a0e; 385bcdb3d55489cadd3ea4d45b54d9e6491b3636; 4e051992f4bc3246e5dab775f5f72efca5aa1eea; 0af24d586a4fb85e8c3023f83be411a8aae120e2; cc345ede2a5bdf1f31cbc20964de3a97e2277704; 421498c6a1337f70e82657cc8b2aad50c178bf86; 48661a8cabe0803ccf381124c5f4d25ded8218f7; b05c0490bc3798c99572c2f56e2777362d44a520; 1760422a3fc1a2f946e9ca3b0d28f7095af0a0fb; 9c5780f2da4a0524b1d4ea01085ea3b577bd4865; 9298c7f2b20ceb92cbac206acf06ed1f52920f2b; 25d411e21a6b0bb0ca4763656fe4f5a07f38df1e; f27449d4d2299c91655cca43f28024164dc90bf3; 83bdb5b9f164b3959132f0915239e45ada21a491; 8d15b36bb1c2393dc5992ca0dec3d31e63ad4371; 65483bb7cef9cbcdf71e92ea858e706fcb8832dd; 7d8aac28fa2df9308e2b97fb4e6159313088fc3b; 58c02a520c4d06da92b276f3a8f2fd2ced2b8c8c; dfda25a7fa7d717a37f8d862f4684b6dc88845b8; a2607b325b2d1c0d558ba1ea202bec2f8ad8f1d5,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,46 8,"

aa6f43104ec7621eabcd03834db47fc3a0d678ab,Identification of Allergen-Susceptibility Genes Using Recombinant Inbred Mouse Model of Allergic Asthma,"Recombinant Inbred Mouse Model of Allergic Asthma D. N. Grigoryev, E. P. Hoffman, M. Wills-Karp, K. C. Barnes; Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, Childrenâ€™s National Medical Center, Washington, DC, Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH. RATIONALE: Knowledge of genetic determinants conferring susceptibility to allergic asthma (AA) remains limited. Identification of chromosomal regions harboring AA susceptibility loci and utilization of recombinant inbred (RI) murine strains may accelerate the discovery of asthma-associated candidate genes. METHODS: AA-sensitive A/J (A) 4-week old mice were sensitized (days 0 and 3) with PBS 1 Alum (200 mg/100 ml) or OVA HDM allergen 1 Alum. Mice were challenged intratracheally with PBS or OVA HDM allergen (150 mg/40 ml) on days 10 and 17, and lungs were harvested 6 hours after the second challenge. Gene expression profiles were generated for control (n55) and AA-affected (n55) lung tissues using the 430MOEA (22626 genes) GeneChips and data were analyzed by GCOS1.4GCRMA-SAM streamline. Genes with a false discovery rate (q<0.05%) and 64 expression fold change versus control were considered significantly affected by AA and linked to the corresponding genetic markers in the mouse genome. RESULTS: The genomic distribution of 167 AA-associated genes was skewed towards chromosomes 1, 11, and 7 which were represented by 12.6%, 12.0% and 8.4% of the allergen challenge-induced genes, respectively. Genomes of 24 available recombinant inbred (RI) backcrosses of A and AA-resistant C57BL/6J (B) strains (AxB) were screened for global parental genetic contributions. This analysis identified the highest content of susceptible A parental genetic markers in AxB-7 (66%) and AxB-9 (62%), suggesting high sensitivity of these strains to allergen challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatical identification of allergen sensitive/ resistant backcross strains facilitates selection of RI mice for AA phenotyping and will accelerate the discovery of AA susceptibility-associated candidate genes.

1799d19c7062724572d130f01873e02e8e8bf73b,Network-Based Identification of Altered Stem Cell Pluripotency and Calcium Signaling Pathways in Metastatic Melanoma,"Malignancy of cancer has been linked to distinct subsets of stem-like cells, the so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), which persist during treatment and seem to lead to drug-resistant recurrence. Metastatic spread of cancer cells is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and contributes to most human melanoma-related deaths. Recently, overlapping groups of proteins and pathways were shown to regulate stem cell migration and cancer metastasis, raising the question of whether genes/proteins involved in stem cell pluripotency may have important implications when applied to the biology of cancer metastasis. Furthermore, it is well known that ion channels and receptors, particularly those responsible for calcium (Ca2+) signal generation, are critical in determining the cellular fate of stem cells (SCs). In the present study, we searched for evidence of altered stem cell pluripotency and Ca2+ signaling-related genes in the context of melanoma metastasis. We did this by using network analysis of gene expression in tissue biopsies from three different independent datasets of patients. First, we created an in silico network model (""STEMCa"" interactome) showing the landscape of interactions between stem cell pluripotency and Ca2+ signaling-related genes/proteins, and demonstrated that around 51% (151 out of 294) of the genes within this model displayed significant changes of expression (False Discovery Rate (FDR), corrected p-value < 0.05) in at least one of the datasets of melanoma metastasis when compared with primary tumor biopsies (controls). Analysis of the properties (degree and betweenness) of the topological network revealed 27 members as the most central hub (HB) and nonhub-bottlenecks (NH-B) among the 294 genes/proteins of the whole interactome. From those representative genes, CTNNB1, GNAQ, GSK3B, GSTP1, MAPK3, PPP1CC, PRKACA, and SMAD4 showed equal up- or downregulation (corrected p-value < 0.05) in at least 2 independent datasets of melanoma metastases samples and PTPN11 showed upregulation (corrected p-value < 0.05) in three of them when compared with control samples. We postulate that altered expression of stem cell pluripotency and Ca2+ signaling pathway-related genes may contribute to the metastatic transformation, with these central members being an optimal candidate group of biomarkers and in silico therapeutic targets for melanoma metastasis, which deserve further investigation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ben-Hur Neves de Oliveira"", ids = ""8449389""); list(name = ""Carla Dalmaz"", ids = ""4519334""); list(name = ""Fares ZeidÃ¡n-ChuliÃ¡"", ids = ""1397980119"")",8aaa3bdc7baf6246817029ffa73bc659071df0cd,dc7e464525414d258c7a253530f60ac60f6e4a33; ceee6447b291f8052a28c9eb00ca360d6f39f9b1; 70776056e5e72104e0ddb6e4ebf7018778b62cf4; 77f7bec124e392eba32699ebd6287e9ceab5d6c3; 14011cce3ee10ed6c02e8c3330e01b4dcf595652; bc7f71fe347c0709b8bd9a092d58b6385a6d7b9e; c6179867caf2131568158b0fdf71bba966f80d63; e6770951fec51d31a2be0d7c0865ebafc8e00069; a77b3e1e4ce09dcbc6477eebcf94d56f686eb23e; f9d02195af78ff81e7a87966c910b49b9e37d741; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 07a53dbbb264e2f1f668f548d827fe20941668d0; db4314be58b52706dd524a22e12ba5488e31c43e; 4c24aa90caa16dd18492c8095afe7726ff20735c; 3933ccf5cbf1c481de88e441d6ac052f87950a14; 6f8eaae0bf239b7acb5902fcb95b90ab8abb86ad; b3f714018aaf765713ccd9d8cad12a6347ba76ab; f0a79673e6eee85a178e06d465617c866af6cfe4; 508f70a2f521f6195464b9871d80489fd1183318; 0296ff431481f6f6761e3f8a04dbbe57813657f0; bfbfab7795844568ed05f5be3c5eb7e14150ef32; ac6453c02fc6dca903c2b373e3a3bab41088e0bf; 4f85f2c4eb2c8ae74c75dbd8ca9d1dd71c5b5f3d; 08fefdfc3ccf6fabe0ddf5fa8a1c4591dcf0c001; a0e4fc81f38450925c4303265a0c0eace4004d5f; 64bddf4209bede9e245193d4f9275252eb32cc3e; 0c50fe5fda8444014094767ae68c472c2d7b2b4d; 7e67c778de9aa3c15124b9948314b783e884e596; f34b3a2d96e51a9fdaa3f82a02d493b353fcbfe5; 9be862768b9133cb9f02a4e9649dacc1e1bde300; 8672737fe45a81b14424bf4b1e33054091c1db97; 38931cd2409e955917a63071a0211a2d55cdd1ad; 6d3d11ca3ecc18b6b3b650d9225956929885bd20,Medical Sciences,6,
5f7095fa1dc8e22585f0b840e89fc41d0662b4cb,Filtering genetic variants and placing informative priors based on putative biological function,"High-density genetic marker data, especially sequence data, imply an immense multiple testing burden. This can be ameliorated by filtering genetic variants, exploiting or accounting for correlations between variants, jointly testing variants, and by incorporating informative priors. Priors can be based on biological knowledge or predicted variant function, or even be used to integrate gene expression or other omics data. Based on Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 19 data, this article discusses diversity and usefulness of functional variant scores provided, for example, by PolyPhen2, SIFT, or RegulomeDB annotations. Incorporating functional scores into variant filters or weights and adjusting the significance level for correlations between variants yielded significant associations with blood pressure traits in a large family study of Mexican Americans (GAW19 data set). Marker rs218966 in gene PHF14 and rs9836027 in MAP4 significantly associated with hypertension; additionally, rare variants in SNUPN significantly associated with systolic blood pressure. Variant weights strongly influenced the power of kernel methods and burden tests. Apart from variant weights in test statistics, prior weights may also be used when combining test statistics or to informatively weight p values while controlling false discovery rate (FDR). Indeed, power improved when gene expression data for FDR-controlled informative weighting of association test p values of genes was used. Finally, approaches exploiting variant correlations included identity-by-descent mapping and the optimal strategy for joint testing rare and common variants, which was observed to depend on linkage disequilibrium structure.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefanie Friedrichs"", ids = ""4396249""); list(name = ""DÃ¶rthe Malzahn"", ids = ""46869622""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Wyn Pugh"", ids = ""3560000""); list(name = ""MÃ¡rcio A.

5c4f9ff0ec567c33705112f84587add453482164,Disrupted Brain Structural Connectivity: Pathological Interactions Between Genetic APOE Îµ4 Status and Developed MCI Condition,"The Îµ4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are both risk factors for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). One factor is genetic, and the other is a developed condition during the aging process. The current study intended to discover the interactions of these two factors, which may be useful in the construction of a sensitive biomarker for early identification and intervention. Eight hundred eighty-five Chinese Han ethnic subjects (aged 55 and older) completed neuropsychological tests and APOE genotyping. One hundred ten of these participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for T1 structural and diffusion tensor imaging scans. Subjects were divided into four groups according to APOE Îµ4 carrying status and MCI condition: Îµ4+ MCI, Îµ4+ normal cognition (NC), Îµ4âˆ’ MCI, and Îµ4âˆ’ NC. In the studied Han population in Beijing, 16.9Â % (Îµ2Îµ4Â =Â 1.1Â %, Îµ3Îµ4Â =Â 14.8Â %, and Îµ4Îµ4Â =Â 0.9Â %) carried at least one Îµ4 allele. Significant interactions between APOE Îµ4 and MCI were found in general cognitive function (pÂ =Â 0.001) and white matter connectivity network (clustering coefficient, pÂ =Â 0.004, and local efficiency, pÂ =Â 0.011); the combination of Îµ4 positivity and MCI was accompanied by reductions in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores, global white matter network connectivity, and the right hippocampus (rHIP) nodal efficiency within that network (false discovery rate (FDR), pÂ <Â 0.05).

bd5375c997e789a17491945f1fb16616acbb3914,MethylAction: detecting differentially methylated regions that distinguish biological subtypes,"DNA methylation differences capture substantial information about the molecular and gene-regulatory states among biological subtypes. Enrichment-based next generation sequencing methods such as MBD-isolated genome sequencing (MiGS) and MeDIP-seq are appealing for studying DNA methylation genome-wide in order to distinguish between biological subtypes. However, current analytic tools do not provide optimal features for analyzing three-group or larger study designs. MethylAction addresses this need by detecting all possible patterns of statistically significant hyper- and hypo- methylation in comparisons involving any number of groups. Crucially, significance is established at the level of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and bootstrapping determines false discovery rates (FDRs) associated with each pattern. We demonstrate this functionality in a four-group comparison among benign prostate and three clinical subtypes of prostate cancer and show that the bootstrap FDRs are highly useful in selecting the most robust patterns of DMRs.

7485652928a246a763678c9dadab4f1c516ea97f,Controlling false discoveries in genetic studies.,"A false discovery occurs when a researcher concludes that a marker is involved in the etiology of the disease whereas in reality it is not. In genetic studies the risk of false discoveries is very high because only few among the many markers that can be tested will have an effect on the disease. In this article, we argue that it may be best to use methods for controlling false discoveries that would introduce the same ratio of false discoveries divided by all rejected tests into the literature regardless of systematic differences between studies. After a brief discussion of traditional ""multiple testing"" methods, we show that methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) may be more suitable to achieve this goal. These FDR methods are therefore discussed in more detail. Instead of merely testing for main effects, it may be important to search for gene-environment/covariate interactions, gene-gene interactions or genetic variants affecting disease subtypes. In the second section, we point out the challenges involved in controlling false discoveries in such searches. The final section discusses the role of replication studies for eliminating false discoveries and the complexities associated with the definition of what constitutes a replication and the design of these studies.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Edwin J.C.G. van den Oord"", ids = ""48799852"")",aeb67cd7b711fc1e50c207934ce88b6669a5eb13; 09fde7410f4b53641074c4cb3e7d60e0944d847f; 777a63d8e69c8c80c2178beff023be9f759a4ca0; b28ff95b87818b836f30c8a1014c3393c874ec07; c5efda4037782893e79cb4592208f3a48a61dd35; afe370768da2420ab07adcb69c227337454a3820; ed6ab9c967530353618c0f6cdf894bb23b79cee2; deb899cbc66784f8f47440fbdf61c81377a471fe; 0ab33b9b680c47f76a310da6b8e3933365872168; a2ccf9244054515b595e83587adc19621e817217; ef8adcc408bd59e86db1ffb2f8effc8f4cbcdb40; 90f656c24283f1adb8d3815a7f15a808368fc816; d8d827104166ef73d2f42b1b8580e5f627a1fa31; 899242516f30e8fc22f3aea4e1eddffdc765538d; 3d1de30404bdca617961f8e53807e44efed4f6a8; ffd73e0866eee0fb96d0520f27e217c8944ccc95; 53ef21febb2f6743e1f9b34c7d366b67427d6937; 68d8be86ca03f601f7d7174d76622d9214b7a01e; 63256ec02f1c5f430b7891056ea1e18e022e8ffe; 9946bfdb9f8c27cbc87dbb1aef2f0c2c48b06bc3; 454eeb6e0e462bbdc2f65d67902497c63f7283e7; 3b42fc73131e42767d0d1f14e5620cb645eac035; c0b7f5c4711960829fa2e50c346a17568f74f589; 6136d8d0640b3d5e949a386c63a3908b93ff4bc5; 0fd9b71c8ca3fb1f3b625a4674b903ed62ae3524; 6048086b47997b72309f14bd42b457888786aecb; 3775ffa9f303a8500e9dadaec2119f258ccd8823; dba61d1c343fe0fe022d7e0c2bcafdd15e2f5acd; 505a5bd65f5376f31614cc090082994bedf27ff9; f65c0321e2b6ec48155e6a434205cf335d6c0cde; 535240d16d638d0a63d3b9fbf3e6fd00ec199146; 592b60e791b1a1adc8dd55287d1b613de6f04645; af42e8fde47e47c0959ba80791924657a1b97112; 782b5102432d341384d5a58590ee1ad30bf0cbc5; 20810af1d19bfab26d99ead77cea22551db24280; a2614244166731afd9c9c17cbcf29b63ae633a85; a6d0ac7b4e7046a0caf4eb5a8d7cc4c99fe8bcaf; 26744b631de0c6a97355d06e7624943b11575938; bd8894ddb3e9b072a305d5ce2ecd94b5d61d2a44; db8fd3c4d63e46e6faa550b930b35185b8d37eee; df4c369b984524801d47ad2ef7a0f52829a43c5c; 9af26d2379f57824a17ecc7e525030d11a8a1908; 1ab04c1689a0b058ec9b515a5afb3477f8565817; d56b4afa0693688e786957683a270dcf9a785161; 1e9b1a3e86807a3191f78a2a55be1149d34fd552; 8fed2164779b3a2a4e0774cfea7e00d3ea1be1db; 89e130ba420b181d711f997ddd358b021323b5b0; a40d2b44d1154c62e5c28a337bafbd4d5fa108db; 0e0c90fbd9d985370babefb47bad2384dba534c8; b4cdb609db8def8fb15e47b372401a18190b71e3; 174cbddcf091b712304a22e43cdf7f5d36a57d6c; 05043cc44c382c4c1e5a0cddc313d4c7120cd646; 8dc988870e4d5f609a7530ddbcbf661440773937; 9d2aa689305a0fb4230af70c7e05fdcb030aa182,,"American journal of medical genetics.

28d62d3a7e21b404347e37b0c8027f1d1269e475,Image defocus and altered retinal gene expression in chick: clues to the pathogenesis of ametropia.,"PURPOSE
Because of the retina's role in refractive development, this study was conducted to analyze the retinal transcriptome in chicks wearing a spectacle lens, a well-established means of inducing refractive errors, to identify gene expression alterations and to develop novel mechanistic hypotheses about refractive development.


METHODS
One-week-old white Leghorn chicks wore a unilateral spectacle lens of +15 or -15 D for 6 hours or 3 days. With total RNA from the retina/(retinal pigment epithelium, RPE), chicken gene microarrays were used to compare gene expression levels between lens-wearing and contralateral control eyes (n = 6 chicks for each condition). Normalized microarray signal intensities were evaluated by analysis of variance, using a false discovery rate of <10% as the statistical criterion. Selected differentially expressed genes were validated by qPCR.


RESULTS
Very few retina/RPE transcripts were differentially expressed after plus lens wear. In contrast, approximately 1300 transcripts were differentially expressed under each of the minus lens conditions, with minimal overlap. For each condition, low fold-changes typified the altered transcriptome. Differentially regulated genes under the minus lens conditions included many potentially informative signaling molecules and genes whose protein products have roles in intrinsic retinal circadian rhythms.


CONCLUSIONS
Plus or minus lens wear induce markedly different, not opposite, alterations in retina/RPE gene expression. The initial retinal responses to defocus are quite different from those when the eye growth patterns are well established, suggesting that different mechanisms govern the initiation and persistence or progression of refractive errors. The gene lists identify promising signaling candidates and regulatory pathways for future study, including a potential role for circadian rhythms in refractive development.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Richard A.

66b3812a733b7e989df8b89be2de2258e6b5fe64,Orbital pseudotumor can be a localized form of granulomatosis with polyangiitis as revealed by gene expression profiling.,"Biopsies and ANCA testing for limited forms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) are frequently non-diagnostic. We characterized gene expression in GPA and other causes of orbital inflammation. We tested the hypothesis that a sub-set of patients with non-specific orbital inflammation (NSOI, also known as pseudotumor) mimics a limited form of GPA. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital biopsies were obtained from controls (n=20) and patients with GPA (n=6), NSOI (n=25), sarcoidosis (n=7), or thyroid eye disease (TED) (n=20) and were divided into discovery and validation sets. Transcripts in the tissues were quantified using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Distinct gene expression profiles for controls and subjects with GPA, TED, or sarcoidosis were evident by principal coordinate analyses. Compared with healthy controls, 285 probe sets had elevated signals in subjects with GPA and 1472 were decreased (>1.5-fold difference, false discovery rate adjusted p<0.05). The immunoglobulin family of genes had the most dramatic increase in expression. Although gene expression in GPA could be readily distinguished from gene expression in TED, sarcoidosis, or controls, a comparison of gene expression in GPA versus NSOI found no statistically significant differences. Thus, forms of orbital inflammation can be distinguished based on gene expression. NSOI/pseudotumor is heterogeneous but often may be an unrecognized, localized form of GPA.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""James T.

53433e3f7f76b97052150e9e87e7ca11db1e4d3d,Bayesianâ€“frequentist hybrid model with application to the analysis of gene copy number changes,"Gene copy number (GCN) changes are common characteristics of many genetic diseases. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new technology widely used today to screen the GCN changes in mutant cells with high resolution genome-wide. Statistical methods for analyzing such CGH data have been evolving. Existing methods are either frequentist's or full Bayesian. The former often has computational advantage, while the latter can incorporate prior information into the model, but could be misleading when one does not have sound prior information. In an attempt to take full advantages of both approaches, we develop a Bayesian-frequentist hybrid approach, in which a subset of the model parameters is inferred by the Bayesian method, while the rest parameters by the frequentist's. This new hybrid approach provides advantages over those of the Bayesian or frequentist's method used alone. This is especially the case when sound prior information is available on part of the parameters, and the sample size is relatively small. Spatial dependence and false discovery rate are also discussed, and the parameter estimation is efficient. As an illustration, we used the proposed hybrid approach to analyze a real CGH data.",2011,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ao Yuan"", ids = ""8229943""); list(name = ""Guanjie Chen"", ids = ""2437126""); list(name = ""Juan Xiong"", ids = ""34790626""); list(name = ""Wenqing He"", ids = ""144518672""); list(name = ""Wen Jin"", ids = ""1764187""); list(name = ""Charles Rotimi"", ids = ""50031699"")",7fff2dfc60735a65e068693a929b04db39ec06cb; 215d80d8e8a73caf38d950cde9cba9a6332ed0f1; c2bc559a467defcb1070717c19c1de1067227927,2e20dda16a9595e92508af341d710d9c3cad1d68; 086fc32acfe681760248c447e64d4c59dabd33ae; 7f0d11f139066d3fd782e076348f620f6ecd128d; a3b8146c7950597628689d14551e74d46cc3543d; 9480b2c402bba74d8b47b3b8817fded46cc6dc98; 60d86633c3cefe0fc6e74bac803431b094823e5e; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; f1cd7c9e869251e2e2af8315af258455341343f9; 88ff7c158c4fa072cbf0093ece0ac8a66069f9db; 5c10b2218cc52d9ed26adc546773d566c74de951; 66022f1542756503ebbc2378aa170263acb5f10d; 79cc8f7938c64222753441e01fd15ca24476017a; e2c7ce4e225b7825f56372c90a47a8f17b904682; 09059d58a7676a6b5f693077927d00535b5cdc3e; 4463f383a43b63c9f4bd9bf3b332f166ec79f3ec; ecdd7ad0bfc9edc404f6b5005cf470373397fd1d; 7478c077f6f61a82292ec4d9cbe1af9e71537a08; f6ff767c66ca6de5e003f6055ba622cf97fbd8cb; af216addf4370b5addeb510bd7c9ddde2810a068; 582a2b7ff90c3cb7a1a02ac698462a7ed443c5a4; 47361e36810c2de2e666ee1d1269e70b2c8167e6; 967a34392261c191d995002bf9e2c77cab2ab5f3; 721b25ffad2623a8d1e8044882f66e0dbe678f1d; 56159087f101b3fd5df353410e3ceedb83a0bdb1; 09b053572b43ee8997ccb8e6382d33beaf2a6cc9; cc51c79f4172e8c7691475058dc50426bfb5d9fa; 4bda5ad9b87c44870349622791ba464b454bc886; ecbe7b41b6412d4af05739b0735f7ba034fe0b54; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 799f5f0a077bcd8ac49022e95ef0c3fb16a5e26a; d6f9318d82600c5c57b83df478f8f457726a9578; a895c0b64bbb9077591d4516775c9dbfa65c2a54; 6e4ef9da13090e66d28019b64a886041cb0428e5; 2e5c7a7841b2a6872865c03b9b69fd6683602e22; 3690864f5f6a3987d272511045d5b4f08dac1ce3; 874cc3d7f38afed3543f961b49511aead2c91457,Journal of Applied Statistics,38,1005 - 987
890be87e4272f0cdd426406a08f5ebad02423589,Robust smooth segmentation approach for array CGH data analysis,"MOTIVATION
Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a genome-wide technique to screen for copy number alteration. The existing segmentation approaches for analyzing aCGH data are based on modeling data as a series of discrete segments with unknown boundaries and unknown heights. Although the biological process of copy number alteration is discrete, in reality a variety of biological and experimental factors can cause the signal to deviate from a stepwise function. To take this into account, we propose a smooth segmentation (smoothseg) approach.


METHODS
To achieve a robust segmentation, we use a doubly heavy-tailed random-effect model. The first heavy-tailed structure on the errors deals with outliers in the observations, and the second deals with possible jumps in the underlying pattern associated with different segments. We develop a fast and reliable computational procedure based on the iterative weighted least-squares algorithm with band-limited matrix inversion.


RESULTS
Using simulated and real data sets, we demonstrate how smoothseg can aid in identification of regions with genomic alteration and in classification of samples. For the real data sets, smoothseg leads to smaller false discovery rate and classification error rate than the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm. In a realistic simulation setting, smoothseg is better than wavelet smoothing and CBS in identification of regions with genomic alterations and better than CBS in classification of samples. For comparative analyses, we demonstrate that segmenting the t-statistics performs better than segmenting the data.

83e9991b46f4b290494a619a1cfda76f14bbd7e6,Using the Literature to Construct Causal Models for Pharmacovigilance,"Causal discovery methods provide a means to ascertain causal attribution from observational data. Causal modeling at scale requires a method to populate models with relevant domain knowledge. We propose to use the biomedical literature to perform feature selection for drug/adverse drug event (ADE) models with clinical observational data derived from electronic health records (EHR) as our primary input data source. We reason that spurious (non-causal) drug-ADE associations from co-occurrence-based analyses should diminish conditional on sets of validated confounders identified in the literature. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a publicly available reference data set to test the proposed methodology with 4 ADEs and 399 drug-ADE pairs. We calculated baseline scores using the rank order regression coefficients each drug-ADE pair. We then identified confounding variable candidates for each drugADE pair using relationship constraints based on normalized predicates to search knowledge extracted from the literature in the publicly available SemMedDB repository. To determine eligibility for inclusion, we checked whether or not there were directed edges pointing to both the drug and the ADE. Finally, we tested whether associations from co-occurrence in the clinical data are diminished conditional on sets of permutations of confounders identified in the literature. Confounder yield rate was ~ 90%, indicating that our method successfully identified confounders in the observational data. Causal models attained aggregate performance improvements of ~ 0.07 area under the curve and reduced the False Discovery Rate from 0.50 to 0.38 over purely statistical models using unadjusted logistic regression.",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Scott Malec"", ids = ""2596795""); list(name = ""Assaf Gottlieb"", ids = ""50203355""); list(name = ""Elmer V.

Also available are many type I error rates: the family-wise error rate (FWER), the false discovery rate, the proportion of false positives, and others. Most MTPs are designed to control a specific type I error rate, and it is hard to compare different procedures. We approach the problem by studying the exact level at which threshold step-down (TSD) procedures (an important class of MTPs exemplified by the classic Holm procedure) control the generalized FWER defined as the probability of k or more false rejections. We find that level explicitly for any TSD procedure and any k. No assumptions are made about the dependency structure of the p-values of the individual tests. We derive from our formula a criterion for unimprovability of a procedure in the class of TSD procedures controlling the generalized FWER at a given level. In turn, this criterion implies that for each k the number of such unimprovable procedures is finite and is greater than one if k> 1. Consequently, in this case the most rejective procedure in the above class does not exist. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alexander Y.

be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823,Covariate powered cross-weighted multiple testing,"A fundamental task in the analysis of datasets with many variables is screening for associations. This can be cast as a multiple testing task, where the major challenge is achieving high detection power while controlling type I error. We consider $m$ hypothesis tests represented by pairs $((P_i, X_i))_{1\leq i \leq m}$ of p-values $P_i$ and covariates $X_i$, such that $P_i \perp X_i$ under the null hypothesis. Here, we show how to use information potentially available in the covariates about heterogeneities among hypotheses to increase power compared to conventional procedures that only use the $P_i$. To this end, we upgrade existing weighted multiple testing procedures through the Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW) framework to use data-driven weights which are a function of the covariate $X_i$. Finite sample guarantees, e.g. false discovery rate (FDR) control, are derived from cross-weighting, a novel data-splitting approach that enables learning the weight-covariate function without overfitting as long as the hypotheses can be partitioned into independent folds, with arbitrary within-fold dependence. We show how the increased power of IHW can be understood in terms of the conditional two-groups model. A key implication of IHW is that hypothesis rejection in many common multiple testing setups should not proceed according to the ranking of the p-values, but by an alternative ranking implied by the covariate-weighted p-values.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Nikolaos Ignatiadis"", ids = ""5945772""); list(name = ""W.

A number of (destructive) reference methods were assessed for scoring the severity of this defect in a fruit, including visual assessment, image analysis (% cross section area affected), International Commission on Illumination (CIE) chromameter Lab values of a cut surface and juice Abs 420 , of which visual scoring on a 5 point scale and a colour index based on CIE Lab were recommended. Non-invasive detection of this disorder using three instruments operating in the visible-shortwave near infrared (NIR) but varying in optical geometry (interactance, partial transmission and full transmission) was attempted. Quantitative prediction of defect level was best assessed using visible-shortwave NIRS in a transmission optical geometry, with a typical partial least squares (PLS) regression model with correlation coefficient of determination, R 2 p Â =Â 0.83 and root mean square of errors of predictionÂ =Â 0.63 (5 point defect score scale). The binary classification approaches of linear discriminant analysis, PLS discriminant analysis, support vector machine approach and logistic regression were trialled for separation of acceptable fruit, with the best result achieved using the PLS discriminant analysis method, followed by linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine classification.

04a35fc1d1111ef44b6cf724950cdc294b387d0e,Gene expression in transformed lymphocytes reveals variation in endomembrane and HLA pathways modifying cystic fibrosis pulmonary phenotypes.,"Variation in cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotypes, including lung disease severity, age of onset of persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.Â aeruginosa)Â lung infection, and presence of meconium ileus (MI), has been partially explained by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). It is not expected that GWASs alone are sufficiently powered to uncover all heritable traits associated with CF phenotypic diversity. Therefore, we utilized gene expression association from lymphoblastoid cells lines from 754 p.Phe508del CF-affected homozygous individuals to identify genes and pathways. LPAR6, a G protein coupled receptor, associated with lung disease severity (false discovery rate q value = 0.0006). Additional pathway analyses, utilizing a stringent permutation-based approach, identified unique signals for all three phenotypes. Pathways associated with lung disease severity were annotated in three broad categories: (1) endomembrane function, containing p.Phe508del processing genes, providing evidence of the importance of p.Phe508del processing to explain lung phenotype variation; (2) HLA class I genes, extending previous GWAS findings in the HLA region; and (3) endoplasmic reticulum stress response genes. Expression pathways associated with lung disease were concordant for some endosome and HLA pathways, with pathways identified using GWAS associations from 1,978 CF-affected individuals. Pathways associated with age of onset of persistent P. aeruginosa infection were enriched for HLA class II genes, and those associated with MI were related to oxidative phosphorylation. Formal testing demonstrated that genes showing differential expression associated with lung disease severity were enriched for heritable genetic variation and expression quantitative traits. Gene expression provided a powerful tool to identify unrecognized heritable variation, complementing ongoing GWASs in this rare disease.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wanda K.

bfe5045f32e761e783b078db2fd57c4e82279a46,Metabolomics reveals changes in metabolite concentrations and correlations during sexual development of Eurotium cristatum ( synonym : Aspergillus cristatus ),"Eurotium cristatum is the main probiotic fungus involved in fermentation of Chinese Fuzhuan brick tea, and the amount of E. cristatum is an important indicator of tea quality. Sexual development of E. cristatum consists of three main stages, hypha and ascogonium (at 36 hours post-inoculation), cleistothecium formation (at 48 hours), and cleistothecium ripening (at 72 hours), and each stage exhibits a unique metabolite profile. In this study, developmental changes were analyzed by GCâ€“MS based untargeted metabolomics. Ninety-nine metabolites involved in multiple biochemical pathways were identified. Principal component analysis separated developing E. cristatum into 36, 48 and 72 hour groups. Hierarchical cluster analyses showed that the relative contents of organic acids and amino acids peaked at 36 hours and decreased thereafter, while alcohol and carbohydrate levels peaked at 48âˆ’72 hours. Statistical analysis revealed 401 significant metaboliteâˆ’metabolite correlations (Pearsonâ€™s |r|>0.8 at a false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05), of which 213 were positive and 188 negative.

The intent of this study was to investigate if differences in the CC transcriptome, as determined by RNA-Seq, are associated with embryo implantation. DESIGN: Paired analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with normal ovarian reserve % 42 years of age were recruited for participation. COCs were dissected, and CC RNA was isolated and then stored at -80 C. Embryo identity was maintained, and blastocysts underwent CCS. Patients who had a double embryo transfer resulting in a singleton live birth were potentially informative and were selected for further analysis. DNA fingerprinting was utilized to determine which embryo implanted. A cDNA library was constructed from CC RNA and sequenced using a Life Technologies (LT) Ion Torrent Sequencing platform. Filtered reads were aligned to the hg19 AmpliSeq transcriptome reference (LT). Both negative-binomial based and nonparametric methods were used to identify differentially expressed genes with regards to live birth. RESULTS: CC RNA sequencing of 38 samples (from 19 patients) generated an average of 10.5 4.3 million reads/sample. 23 differentially expressed genes between sibling embryos that resulted in a live birth and those that did not were identified (P < 0.05). However, after correcting for multiple testing none of the genes remained significantly differentially expressed (false discovery rate< 0.05). 173 genes identified in previous studies as predicting implantation, including RGS2, ANG, PTX3, and ZNF132, were not differentially expressed in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there were no candidate biomarkers identified in the CC transcriptome that were differentially expressed between euploid embryos resulting in a live birth and those that failed. This is the first trial of this question to utilize paired euploid sibling embryos which is the optimal study design for identifying effective biomarkers within an individual patientâ€™s cohort of euploid embryos.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ronit Machtinger"", ids = ""5105947""); list(name = ""Rodosthenis S Rodosthenous"", ids = ""6009148""); list(name = ""Abdallah Tageldein Mansour"", ids = ""32350926""); list(name = ""Michal Adir"", ids = ""11180763""); list(name = ""Catherine Racowsky"", ids = ""5704475""); list(name = ""Russ Hauser"", ids = ""48419738""); list(name = ""Andrea A.

989f6bc97343b8f51707ebb029673f9eb0d9a385,Clustering by neurocognition for fine mapping of the schizophrenia susceptibility loci on chromosome 6p.,"Chromosome 6p is one of the most commonly implicated regions in the genome-wide linkage scans of schizophrenia, whereas further association studies for markers in this region were inconsistent likely due to heterogeneity. This study aimed to identify more homogeneous subgroups of families for fine mapping on regions around markers D6S296 and D6S309 (both in 6p24.3) as well as D6S274 (in 6p22.3) by means of similarity in neurocognitive functioning. A total of 160 families of patients with schizophrenia comprising at least two affected siblings who had data for eight neurocognitive test variables of the continuous performance test (CPT) and the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) were subjected to cluster analysis with data visualization using the test scores of both affected siblings. Family clusters derived were then used separately in family-based association tests for 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering the region of 6p24.3 and 6p22.3. Three clusters were derived from the family-based clustering, with deficit cluster 1 representing deficit on the CPT, deficit cluster 2 representing deficit on both the CPT and the WCST, and a third cluster of nondeficit. After adjustment using false discovery rate for multiple testing, SNP rs13873 and haplotype rs1225934-rs13873 on BMP6-TXNDC5 genes were significantly associated with schizophrenia for the deficit cluster 1 but not for the deficit cluster 2 or nondeficit cluster. Our results provide further evidence that the BMP6-TXNDC5 locus on 6p24.3 may play a role in the selective impairments on sustained attention of schizophrenia.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""S.H.

e314043722973986ada3b50848808e2b28e9991e,Differential gene expression of RAW 264.7 macrophages in response to the RGD peptide lunasin with and without lipopolysaccharide stimulation,"Lunasin is a novel peptide from soybean with demonstrated chemopreventive property. We compared the effect of lunasin on gene expression of RAW 264.7 macrophages with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation. Our hypothesis was that lunasin will have a differential effect in RAW 264.7 gene expression in a normal and challenged state. Analysis of the microarray data using False Discovery Rate (FDR) method resulted in the identification of 340 up-regulated and 162 down-regulated genes (FDR p-value <0.05) associated with simultaneous treatment of lunasin and LPS for 24h. Treatment of lunasin with no LPS for 24h resulted in the up-regulation of 855 genes and down-regulation of 397 genes. Pre-treatment of lunasin for 24h resulted in the up-regulation of 35 genes and down-regulation of 65 genes in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. GeneVenn analysis of these three sets of genes showed that there are 66 genes common among the three groups which are mostly associated with regulation of cell death, ion binding and transcription as datamined by DAVID. Analysis of the 838 genes unique to lunasin alone by functional annotation clustering tool showed that lunasin mostly affected genes associated with RNA processing, apoptosis and protein kinase activity. Further datamining of these genes by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed that lunasin affected genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation, cellular function and maintenance, and cell to cell signaling and interaction. These findings support the potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic use of lunasin against cancer.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Vermont P Dia"", ids = ""6290454""); list(name = ""Elvira Gonzalez de Mejia"", ids = ""88456180"")",eb122f10e1a34ee6d097198aa383030a60211d6e; 00992195fa5820be3fc5f8dc536608b6a41fd2d6; 4aec03c842a34774e240a7d69684431face21c1f; ec0bbd0a576f3c22e774e5be03c9a5336b98563c; 36caca037ad37e9f7e4b75f4cb8141a11e411497,2f90166eedf57311bab6ec3f241794b297d76f71; 2e2b1db84dd9701f912b9b397cb4e1796c2731ca; d2e50eab2cbc58ce81b4d43cf21e690e84e78f74; c98033a1dbe3e2450507aa37d1e4d0bc3eb8d1b2; 402017ba9f7f9015c790529b28d6bb9a7e837f90; 911cf10e13708ef4e8dba7a8647306e2290a3462; 6344f1497ab96d94ca20eea9c1252c1b7b57b247; bd89e7dfeb599f861c5aff47823791c927f8bb3d; c37c77dfde26aeff96c5a847b413d38e9cb6854a; dbb9aa3b7db255fda20510e8d4da3fa326e6d4c7; 857350014e456065d2fb0a65e7386ee76d362310; 00bc15f73f73e5ee1b06733056e82d488c1fad82; af501f776116122b44ee40be31ccb05db4458a68; 70264ca9d4de5981e19d192cb538fffaa82c01f3; 2e376af10de1babb3b2835ebf252e13464cfd41f; beb9931476e69a15ccda327a88bff371b7124d58; 8467c281d8fde6311c98150dac7b52708d26012f; 6d0dd30bf24168ff692e4448df86f1e009c887ef; f7f5a35c47031a893c060cf2421451b03af17b9d; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; 401b70ecf7370c69b26633644fff8ec2ef3701eb; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 533c0f877df7474d17c8cbc9850d0470d6f976e0; a16b946cbc2d746dd3d510a4efb88b1f5606327f; 6617ccd9ae422a975aaeb58a56f2c527cad82d90; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 541d60ba20920ccb9c4c401f1a7ca18ccd603922; c85e929128e1b270260809a14128f923a8d97f9b; 67abf47d9c140e725c1d73952f02b8fa4b9f33e8; 616d3fbb9d100773c0557940f5b43e9c236e95a8; bd48e17bb8c3c778894be52a63716b7c6bd7e73d; 5f426e8c0388dccbfcd4df86dd8cca3dae8ffcbc; 28c79fe4f6bb096f018d6ac49c6325abbb02e598; 52b0ca4217727c8269ac0f2f156f9a061835bd01; 0c4eddad8469cffe938cbb7dcacdf0dbb322370a; df64bc55768d6472361198977ec83622e2949aad; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 039b3987acc02c0b94a326c3acb8786b860625e0; 6081c9374bf36bb77c4a2d5242150e8c4555565f; 71925e7c9684cf02d8bf0a5b105cf72f383c3d80; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 42bf85f2ee1dc6a173e81fe9cd1b8f4119b8b465; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 23a3782a4540cbdf96c67b53628cd40ff4551c65; 1bc9a609d2d83a7b824a637c5516a67293e195f1; f46e70b86b540360f48107f882059d4fb58faafa,Peptides,32,1979-1988

Using macroeconomic data, we show that substantial gains in forecast accuracy can be achieved by including both squares and first level interactions of the original variables in a predictive regression model. In case the number of original variables is reasonably large this requires specific econometric considerations though, as the number of parameters to be estimated may greatly exceed the number of available observations. We propose a two-stage ""screen and clean"" procedure that enables estimation and forecasting in this ""ultrahigh-dimensional"" setting. In the first stage, we perform univariate regressions to screen for truly interesting effects, controlling the False Discovery Rate.

UCEC RNA-seq data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differential analysis was performed using edgeR software. A false discovery rate <0.01 and |log2(fold change)|>1 were set as the cut-off criteria to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Differential gene co-expression analysis was performed using R/EBcoexpress package in R. DEGs in the gene co-expression network were subjected to Gene Ontology analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis was also performed on the DEGs using KOBAS 2.0 software. The ConnectivityMap database was used to identify novel drug candidates. A total of 3,742 DEGs were identified among the 552 UCEC samples and 35 normal controls, and comprised 2,580 upregulated and 1,162 downregulated genes. A gene co-expression network consisting of 129 DEGs and 368 edges was constructed. Genes were associated with the cell cycle and the tumor protein p53 signaling pathway. Three modules were identified, in which genes were associated with the mitotic cell cycle, nuclear division and the M phase of the mitotic cell cycle. Multiple key hub genes were identified, including cell division cycle 20, cyclin B2, non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H, BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase, cell division cycle associated 8, maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase, MYB proto-oncogene like 2, TPX2, microtubule nucleation factor and non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G. In addition, the small molecule drug esculetin was implicated in the suppression of UCEC progression. Overall, the present study identified multiple key genes in UCEC and clinically relevant small molecule agents, thereby improving our understanding of UCEC and expanding perspectives on targeted therapy for this type of cancer.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Liang Shen"", ids = ""145407608""); list(name = ""Ming Liu"", ids = ""144292269""); list(name = ""Wei Liu"", ids = ""40255545""); list(name = ""Jing Cui"", ids = ""143805961""); list(name = ""Changzhong Li"", ids = ""2044913"")",3e415d538b8024a35e652075c153362d6976eb20; eecd956eabd8522764eff8eba3689f84ffc33cc0; 8b2d76df51ca7d02a53b4776f23da696c3330008; a7d787ced17784c731e6239594212055ed842b46,f7bdc9e36eeea7c7e6526f1009d2630cb865132a; dabee917a06fc88fdd5c3ea0d526e158f3b1461e; e8a79eb9d3651c77daaf2c181d4d605167687549; e8ea61a75b037478726db08f8828b92795ae70b0; b8fb29e4d407e16005754142033fac7801b874f3; 834dd628285e7f36c7d3dad371f18583891e9b09; bda1cba80c706521ba04c54a91077896a9a4dc56; 25793259a06ee170f5fd3204a23d01173467d745; 2f2f43b393de5f81356c7a70cee61b62e7db08a1; 9e629f819436ae0e591fedda424ffc49a3114f2d; 9e805b3ca3d48f24a9b4627acf08097af7408e89; db5017c5122afc2f5f0ba8f57ad73e3c8ff4d14a; de854aadf07ec35c166e1ce591886d8167dc999e; 286fc46870589f0d09bf7eeefd856cf908db00d3; b323d2e944805ae70f5d8edf3b925ca700c5dd74; 53624d45190a74443f15fa75b451a05739e921a2; 5b3d823a48f1a1013623260dad4ca4f0c11f696c; 208d83dba2323e24c99be00c127f5254aaf04bdd; 4b25b076ca6fbb5a7253ed0705b98faa1fe2317d; c5ac97a162af43717de3204c2f0729708b37f300; 7df8c133c431cdd36978407b9ad45c43e8c71149; dc1649fcd794cd82ca7916ea3f4955e655b911d8; 8dc1e5098b9cb181741c235f1a4a2310062721e2; 34e5c4ed5b9dfecc73d35ac88d85b6f45e33ae2b; 2e39c86b27f849723e431a364c9ae27e89693d16; 7deee63a9a1b529e359504a35cdc2b30524a4d46; 8f2e20a9d12ebc1f2e7a3365abf1453caf22aaf3; 1f87a5610afb09d32e0c44c150f144b94d332f88; 72187e6a8005bd5ecfd4119114a328d07ffc9239; 85ada8a3fd7dd4ae08cd1818ff7d54355944d02b; bd16aa2a1535171c5d9caef082745a0463757975; 527757ffe4eb098e77c1ad50b54b1a87f650575d; 718e9ee2d0fb6a29ad859f96e3528abf67f62929; c843048bdb04e3d8ea26de206216abf6c77c6811; 00f25c3fc882a2cb33fbd8304198a001b1279d73; 21d5475e230901952d7b28398f33e5116f24fc28; d3a11e336dfdbd941d54b0d7c9c779e8f385849d; 58691730b55b94c4930b3f20b8e040e87e6542aa; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; e6db9eceb21c36e09b72f9f58c5699bdc98c6eb0; afbda5d7546de667948a99af3355973f8f1f82a8; 07ae5611d2a3f34a6e350ab2e24a0adf1f8e6a39; 48769c793949e87698ca47558dea582aa5809273; 4c7c006ec4c37602b019821509bff8c9dd1628c7; e9dbd8aa13649a3fdb46dbf0800f8d4d09b6b625; 528fe39951d313f35a83e2a2603912a12cee1e45,Oncology Letters,15,205 - 212
2b8ef09c0041252171b133d6f8eb1a1742f9dba0,Association analysis of loci implied in â€œbufferingâ€ epistasis,"The existence of buffering mechanisms is an emerging property of biological networks, and this results in the possible existence of â€œbufferingâ€ loci, that would allow buildup of robustness through evolution. So far, there are no explicit methods to find loci implied in buffering mechanisms. However, buffering can be seen as interaction with genetic background. Here we develop this idea into a tractable model for quantitative genetics, in which the buffering effect of one locus with many other loci is condensed into a single (statistical) effect, multiplicative on the total (statistical) additive genetic effect. This allows easier interpretation of the results, and it also simplifies the problem of detecting epistasis from quadratic to linear in the number of loci. Armed with this formulation, we construct a linear model for genome-wide association studies that estimates, and declares significance, of multiplicative epistatic effects at single loci. The model has the form of a variance components, norm reaction model and likelihood ratio tests are used for significance. This model is a generalization and explanation of previous ones. We then test our model using bovine data: Brahman and Tropical Composite animals, phenotyped for body weight at yearling and genotyped up to âˆ¼770,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). After association analysis and based on False Discovery Rate rules, we find a number of loci with buffering action in one, the other, or both breeds; these loci do not have significant statistical additive effect. Most of these loci have been reported in previous studies, either with an additive effect, or as footprints of selection. We identify epistatic SNPs present in or near genes encoding for proteins that are functionally enriched for peptide activity and transcription factors reported in the context of signatures of selection in multi-breed cattle population studies. These include loci known to be associated with coat color, fertility and adaptation to tropical environments. In these populations we found loci that have a non-significant statistical additive effect but a significant epistatic effect. We argue that the discovery and study of loci associated with buffering effects allows attacking the difficult problems, among others, of release of maintenance variance in artificial and natural selection, of quick adaptation to the environment, and of opposite signs of marker effects in different backgrounds. We conclude that our method and our results generate promising new perspectives for research in evolutionary and quantitative genetics based on the study of loci that buffer effect of other loci.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""AndrÃ©s Legarra"", ids = ""2221305""); list(name = ""Zulma G Vitezica"", ids = ""6619310""); list(name = ""Marina Naval-SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""1401928325""); list(name = ""John M.

8b3b0d14d89d7be6e47b00ebef2d0db0360675db,Predicting nucleosome positioning using a duration Hidden Markov Model,"BackgroundThe nucleosome is the fundamental packing unit of DNAs in eukaryotic cells. Its detailed positioning on the genome is closely related to chromosome functions. Increasing evidence has shown that genomic DNA sequence itself is highly predictive of nucleosome positioning genome-wide. Therefore a fast software tool for predicting nucleosome positioning can help understanding how a genome's nucleosome organization may facilitate genome function.ResultsWe present a duration Hidden Markov model for nucleosome positioning prediction by explicitly modeling the linker DNA length. The nucleosome and linker models trained from yeast data are re-scaled when making predictions for other species to adjust for differences in base composition. A software tool named NuPoP is developed in three formats for free download.ConclusionsSimulation studies show that modeling the linker length distribution and utilizing a base composition re-scaling method both improve the prediction of nucleosome positioning regarding sensitivity and false discovery rate. NuPoP provides a user-friendly software tool for predicting the nucleosome occupancy and the most probable nucleosome positioning map for genomic sequences of any size. When compared with two existing methods, NuPoP shows improved performance in sensitivity.",2010,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Liqun Xi"", ids = ""2376073""); list(name = ""Yvonne Fondufe-Mittendorf"", ids = ""1422635919""); list(name = ""Lei Xia"", ids = ""46329121""); list(name = ""Jared Flatow"", ids = ""2569156""); list(name = ""Jonathan Widom"", ids = ""3006469""); list(name = ""Ji-Ping Wang"", ids = ""46583890"")",6c5766758b39e742d01662ed8258425ac824a28b; a3e5501aa6e546c7477b23fe4c661e346a085d3c; 30e2229f4799cab5c6314c0eae74f84b04633c89; 0c08e8ed05a8e8c0911059ac965daf81cee88dc5; 8b3b0d14d89d7be6e47b00ebef2d0db0360675db; c71495f90318bb4918f636312f24d92d7dc7fd4a; 496f6942da8b1cde1a6c50a288e5da144bb0d38c; 01befac51398d4bd602d819ae2a8b83fbd04a86d; 64716c2a68fb40861f0c209bdb27967f310143ec; 9805070e77e14a4102dc8974d866786a3d169577; 6b326d1c40aa92d9312ea5985ad8db739ab995b9; 04098bb6d5b50bed1aecb578804fdb2814e36326; 7dfbd144566852b1d6e6272c42a71cc0c88f6399; 2c118a569585e94d98efd70aaa3faddf9c8fcd9b; 2f1beb332c7b11849964c3add629f5808f6f686e; 46dcd94f3089f53627307af81987952177884255; 9385aac5b4228e06fb74e898fc0a9eb553685d0f; 72fa0ef0c056056bc6c233c54b96d73d051e692a; 862983582afed895c53a56b4f96ed06867434147; 561c60b44147da6e0901966ac22e7a39b770128d; cbf5a80c14808c6f63ac7b7d523ff2193dcfbd0e; 3dfe9d85cf7404d4b1a1bbc933844d3301c2d88e; e084343ed312ff435a31c5297386946bc0622356; fd70692c5fe8ca79f3344aa6f9f74c2a34dad232; c184f2bca1e0d9f2890ab5bbfa5009bdb4663ffb; 01e80b6888b598e997b057160bda42936e796772; ddc8f96f29d827e7557b82ced0987deb67d21ae6; 7663c5d4019f28b37f3b256facc1f1e42cea3fd3; 3ccb740434088f022ad93382d396459c24b62103; 591122539814e86906cfbca25b91579190077cf0; 97645cc5e6c943f9bd7f6cd974b8f8556882237c; aadbac7e25d611a8893526004c0160ba781d75e2; 1f95f6a2050e8439800da9014f86a29c1a87a295; 6a4505cb41f67e91d3040e18abe5e6bbd9c67845; 12acb81a784b07702bef960eea500b8ac0e0de6c; 73ecf2d0bc9a35030ad289ac63b0f183f5fde295; 13c9f87140f9a52c121b89ff409386261fa1bd45; 10d51da611ce5248acba3af2529e726530d545b2; 9500b016cd2ea8e0d7d33fca65fdacafd6aa1d0d; 74c00ddca9606dc31fca0d665f3f5a4bca37b682; d27ae0236dc0e59b81a5767920cab3686816927a; 49249740076a99f8e3e06382c9ca788dfceee223; 6e59b6c5e0aa01ef74cc2c6fbac031c2afe95d2d; 6ddb7204b28282dd74da2d63bf176938c2b58e73; 8abbfaf2209a4f29c1fba2c156c0f6d4e809f44d; ffc770677216ce2a125c9b1fe659c2bc3d8eeee8; 21480c629d8050e9338ed10dc6f60f21e16df995; 1bd9d416d7f0dc81b9882e4c32253539a7e61100; 54d35bca1a19ad22839760282a638bf9a547d877; 0d082360a8bc54a2ef20cdc35e5c8d2d5d8296a5; 7e1118a2a6390f98133d132cad8a8fb4379ecd81; a872e64919db8b9cd6fdceb1964993d90a320a7e; dd8d5f8b9a2f63a63ace12860b2b8bc9db31e1ef; 06a2fa7bd9f389e57b2756cdd21db58c3180ff19; 39b99496aa44a353e284209330de9dca64c52fc6; 0e3d41d2d4e10a20c8e397753504d7564a97a73c; c662dd6ca7cb1971652b260e694fc65a691d5282; 2d4b7768b1db58c400ab2f31bf027b2ae02f2720; f8e98a8887c4ba53d5b6a6eea24647f7af9ab2dc; 654b2ead36c20376f5e6ad4b3e0d2b418eb02e12; 6d2fe4ea60fa4bf3509f29f3c46486807cffaf82; d4f5c85b8aaf3e35ea135c0f899b95cfe59fbadf; bdd536167ae693aedfeca8bffd92a833cf34cbd0; a524fbc921d3029569d924723c0ce707ccef36fa; 1f391732c3063bf96cc1cd14f92f0384c9226a0b; ebee591bcfb0de449ebd0cd3d02da6c51da23bc6; 0e115c328aa71a7583114fea609d8cfb3f3d0892; fdef69aa4d7bcd126c809e2c49123a389e226727; bee5eb7895ed043825e283744e258caba86be231; 9f4e1a4b2f285cb61d92efe3d87c94fd985bdf79; c42318cd01eb427dd73d7f419ff1d5dbb36bb715; f3ecec021b230816e7fa51debedb151ac966eccf; ec86eba2cc4ba9d291c6a9ab5ec4933bd3375379; 29544ff527d6fc6c527748c3ea2a1a4f410c4612; 24159da6cefd607af792d97a6862b790aed5806e; 83d5f685d9f6595d43ed7cbf75d225e457937006; dc13914ba090f3197ebccf39ab0787a8fcc35949; 1cc897845a1136ee6ec0344909ea9a29c1899a9f; fa76ed97b89bbce91fb0db28b04993a05dae3846; 926d49425762af52327c1aff9e7b1c4586be1121; 3b482bfeac7c3b00129cd40d08b8396c3f374f07; ac4307fb78f3a6471a2b390612b15ea02d34fe8f,a658b3d356b3518bfd6d719c99a4e21cf8172c68; 0ab7337cf6b3a2c7273a66dfa485118a1916fd57; 8b3b0d14d89d7be6e47b00ebef2d0db0360675db; 5815d252012f952bd5b654441ee84289ce676bb6; 5d7e4a52d4e3dbf535ca0c17ad4ce69621f55402; 761d1165b0ee18c577f86929ccc29f9b6de6d796; 0973a5d8c44b7e87945f87cd4c7eb25607cf8809; bc2e06d7c8cfe76e876d5edf70961ed19679e417; ad2013b1912d2ad8f7ea32a1874a156993b2269f; 8fe2ea0a67954f1380b3387e3262f1cdb9f9b3e5; 1536f349e4b2d71ec86a2e0022c78a45e21c1808; 890fb5fc9885c9560b5ec714f6b3a12d053ddbc2; 35a37337c2f363e0dab80cc04afacd6f221e73a0; fb4760b29adbb4b8c7ab397ee72b77ae1e67a4c6; 4f332a98b143b9988de03690fae1f71f6b57eff3; 3693dab9b92d7727eb8171e5f3b4f880e4760fa3; 5221516102e9080b1986db41a6f955a4f84f73e7; ca4c2928367dfc2d7a10cd76fc092fc1fc934c3e; 83a99e5588071c69abeb32b0e3817df5472baec9; d19d4a7498607f6caf083e4569569ee969ce628f,BMC Bioinformatics,11,346 - 346
2564c41f418f70665494b0cb766b3ac03f7b63d5,Noninvasive genomic detection of melanoma,"BACKGROUND
Early detection and treatment of melanoma is important for optimal clinical outcome, leading to biopsy of pigmented lesions deemed suspicious for the disease. The vast majority of such lesions are benign. Thus, a more objective and accurate means for detection of melanoma is needed to identify lesions for excision.


OBJECTIVES
To provide proof-of-principle that epidermal genetic information retrieval (EGIRâ„¢; DermTech International, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.), a method that noninvasively samples cells from stratum corneum by means of adhesive tape stripping, can be used to discern melanomas from naevi.


METHODS
Skin overlying pigmented lesions clinically suspicious for melanoma was harvested using EGIR. RNA isolated from the tapes was amplified and gene expression profiled. All lesions were removed for histopathological evaluation.


RESULTS
Supervised analysis of the microarray data identified 312 genes differentially expressed between melanomas, naevi and normal skin specimens (P<0Â·001, false discovery rate q<0Â·05). Surprisingly, many of these genes are known to have a role in melanocyte development and physiology, melanoma, cancer, and cell growth control. Subsequent class prediction modelling of a training dataset, consisting of 37 melanomas and 37 naevi, discovered a 17-gene classifier that discriminates these skin lesions. Upon testing with an independent dataset, this classifier discerned in situ and invasive melanomas from naevi with 100% sensitivity and 88% specificity, with an area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic of 0Â·955.


CONCLUSIONS
These results demonstrate that EGIR-harvested specimens can be used to detect melanoma accurately by means of a 17-gene genomic biomarker.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""William Wachsman"", ids = ""4443628""); list(name = ""Vera B.

9dc799d65125bb10a7a823bc1cf4edfceef0f83f,Informatics strategies for large-scale novel cross-linking analysis.,"The detection of protein interactions in biological systems represents a significant challenge for today's technology. Chemical cross-linking provides the potential to impart new chemical bonds in a complex system that result in mass changes in a set of tryptic peptides detected by mass spectrometry. However, system complexity and cross-linking product heterogeneity have precluded widespread chemical cross-linking use for large-scale identification of protein-protein interactions. The development of mass spectrometry identifiable cross-linkers called protein interaction reporters (PIRs) has enabled on-cell chemical cross-linking experiments with product type differentiation. However, the complex datasets resultant from PIR experiments demand new informatics capabilities to allow interpretation. This manuscript details our efforts to develop such capabilities and describes the program X-links, which allows PIR product type differentiation. Furthermore, we also present the results from Monte Carlo simulation of PIR-type experiments to provide false discovery rate estimates for the PIR product type identification through observed precursor and released peptide masses. Our simulations also provide peptide identification calculations based on accurate masses and database complexity that can provide an estimation of false discovery rates for peptide identification. Overall, the calculations show a low rate of false discovery of PIR product types due to random mass matching of approximately 12% with 10 ppm mass measurement accuracy and spectral complexity resulting from 100 peptides. In addition, consideration of a reduced database resulting from stage 1 analysis of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 containing 367 proteins resulted in a significant reduction of expected identification false discovery rate estimation compared to that from the entire Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 proteome.",2007,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Gordon A.

We characterized HPV genotypes within cervical tumor biopsies, assessed the relationships of cervical disease stage with age, HIV-1 status, absolute CD4 count, and CD4 percentage, and identified the predictive power of these variables for cervical disease stage in a cohort of South African women.We recruited 181 women who were histologically diagnosed with cervical disease; 87 were HIV-1-positive and 94 were HIV-1-seronegative. Colposcopy-directed tumor biopsies were confirmed by histology and used for genomic DNA extraction. The Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping test was used for HPV genotyping. Peripheral whole blood was used for HIV-1 rapid testing. Fully automated FC500MPL/CellMek with PanLeucogate (PLG) was used to determine absolute CD4 count, CD4 percentage, and CD45 count. Chi-squared test, a logistic regression model, parametric Pearson correlation, and ROC curves were used for statistical analyses. We used the Benjamini-Horchberg test to control for false discovery rate (FDR, q-value). All tests were significant when both P and q were <.05.Age was a significant predictor for invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in both HIV-1-seronegative (Pâ€Š<â€Š.0001, qâ€Š<â€Š0.0001) and HIV-1-positive women (P = .0003, q = 0.0003). Sixty eight percent (59/87) of HIV-1-positive women with different stages of cervical disease presented with a CD4 percentage equal or less than 28%, and a median absolute CD4 count of 400â€Šcells/Î¼l (IQR 300-500â€Šcells/Î¼l). Of the HIV-1-positive women, 75% (30/40) with ICC, possessed â‰¤28% CD4 cells vs 25% (10/40) who possessed >28% CD4 cells (both Pâ€Š<â€Š.001, qâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Furthermore, 70% (28/40) of women with ICC possessed CD4 count >350 compared to 30% (12/40) who possessed CD4 count â‰¤ 350 (both Pâ€Š<â€Š.001, qâ€Š<â€Š0.001).Age is an independent predictor for ICC. In turn, development of ICC in HIV-1-positive women is independent of the host CD4 cells and associates with low CD4 percentage regardless of absolute CD4 count that falls within the normal range. Thus, using CD4 percentage may add a better prognostic indicator of cervical disease stage than absolute CD4 count alone.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramadhani Salum Chambuso"", ids = ""20793759""); list(name = ""Raj Ramesar"", ids = ""145874045""); list(name = ""Evelyn Kaambo"", ids = ""22205064""); list(name = ""Alltalents T.

90d2de599dd17acb173604076e7bf03d6ae286b9,Epistatic interactions associated with fatty acid concentrations of beef from angus sired beef cattle,"BackgroundConsumers are becoming increasingly conscientious about the nutritional value of their food. Consumption of some fatty acids has been associated with human health traits such as blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to investigate genetic variation in content of fatty acids present in meat. Previously publications reported regions of the cattle genome that are additively associated with variation in fatty acid content. This study evaluated epistatic interactions, which could account for additional genetic variation in fatty acid content.ResultsEpistatic interactions for 44 fatty acid traits in a population of Angus beef cattle were evaluated with EpiSNPmpi. False discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at 5Â % and was limited to well-represented genotypic combinations. Epistatic interactions were detected for 37 triacylglyceride (TAG), 36 phospholipid (PL) fatty acid traits, and three weight traits. A total of 6,181, 7,168, and 0 significant epistatic interactions (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05, 50-animals per genotype combination) were associated with Triacylglyceride fatty acids, Phospholipid fatty acids, and weight traits respectively and most were additive-by-additive interactions. A large number of interactions occurred in potential regions of regulatory control along the chromosomes where genes related to fatty acid metabolism reside.ConclusionsMany fatty acids were associated with epistatic interactions. Despite a large number of significant interactions, there are a limited number of genomic locations that harbored these interactions. While larger population sizes are needed to accurately validate and quantify these epistatic interactions, the current findings point towards additional genetic variance that can be accounted for within these fatty acid traits.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Luke M.

Methods:A total of 165 MTLE patients were divided into seizure-free with AED (AED responders, n = 50), pharmacoresistant (n = 87), and remitting-relapsing seizure control group (n = 28). All groups were evaluated regarding age, frequency of seizures, and age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, febrile seizures, presence and side of hippocampal atrophy (HA), and initial precipitating injuries. For gray matter (GM) MRI voxel-based morphometry (VBM) we selected only patients with unilateral HA on visual MRI analysis (n = 100). Comparisons were made between all groups and 75 healthy controls. Results:Age at epilepsy onset was lower (p = 0.005) and initial frequency of seizures was higher in the pharmacoresistant compared with the other 2 groups (p = 0.018). All groups showed GM atrophy compared to controls in ipsilateral hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyri, frontal, occipital, parietal, and cerebellar areas. In the AED responders group, such findings were more restricted to areas ipsilateral to the epileptic focus and more widespread in the pharmacoresistant and remitting-relapsing groups. VBM pairwise comparisons showed areas with GM volume reduction in the pharmacoresistant and remitting-relapsing groups compared with AED responders in bilateral periorbital frontal (p < 0.01), cingulum (p < 0.05), and temporal lobe contralateral to the epileptic focus (p < 0.05). Conclusions:Pharmacoresistant and remitting-relapsing groups presented a similar pattern of GM atrophy, which was more widespread compared with AED responders. Conversely, age at epilepsy onset was lower and initial seizure frequency was higher in pharmacoresistant patients.

We assessed the effects of early childhood trauma on hippocampal subfields in participants with SAD with and without early childhood trauma and PTSD, compared to healthy controls. The sample comprised 26 participants SAD with early childhood trauma, 22 participants with SAD without early childhood trauma, 17 with PTSD secondary to early childhood trauma and 25 control participants. We used Freesurfer version 6 to determine hippocampal subfield volumes. Findings included significant reduction in right parasubiculum volume between the PTSD group secondary to early childhood trauma and the SAD group without early childhood trauma, as well as a significant reduction in left HATA (Hippocampal Amygdala Transition Area) volume between PTSD with early childhood trauma compared to controls, as well as compared to SAD with early childhood trauma. These findings did withstand correction for multiple resting using the false discovery rate. Our findings of an association of reduced volumes in the parasubiculum and HATA regions with PTSD secondary to childhood trauma are interesting. Further work should investigate whether parasubiculum and HATA regional volume reductions in PTSD are a specific effect of early childhood trauma or a specific manifestation of PTSD pathology. Further work should also be undertaken to determine if hippocampal subfield atrophy is associated with SAD in the setting of early childhood maltreatment.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fatima Ahmed-Leitao"", ids = ""1402192376""); list(name = ""David I.

Epidemiological findings suggest a relationship between Alzheimer disease (AD), inflammation, and dyslipidemia, although the nature of this relationship is not well understood. We investigated whether this phenotypic association arises from a shared genetic basis.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Using summary statistics (P values and odds ratios) from genome-wide association studies of >200 000 individuals, we investigated overlap in single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with clinically diagnosed AD and C-reactive protein (CRP), triglycerides, and high- and low-density lipoprotein levels. We found up to 50-fold enrichment of AD single-nucleotide polymorphisms for different levels of association with C-reactive protein, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride single-nucleotide polymorphisms using a false discovery rate threshold <0.05. By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with the 4 phenotypes, we identified 55 loci associated with increased AD risk. We then conducted a meta-analysis of these 55 variants across 4 independent AD cohorts (total: n=29 054 AD cases and 114 824 healthy controls) and discovered 2 genome-wide significant variants on chromosome 4 (rs13113697; closest gene, HS3ST1; odds ratio=1.07; 95% confidence interval=1.05-1.11; P=2.86Ã—10(-8)) and chromosome 10 (rs7920721; closest gene, ECHDC3; odds ratio=1.07; 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.11; P=3.38Ã—10(-8)). We also found that gene expression of HS3ST1 and ECHDC3 was altered in AD brains compared with control brains.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate genetic overlap between AD, C-reactive protein, and plasma lipids. By conditioning on the genetic association with the cardiovascular phenotypes, we identify novel AD susceptibility loci, including 2 genome-wide significant variants conferring increased risk for AD.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rahul S.

According to some assumptions, there are different kinds of multiple comparison and multiple confidence tests in the literature. In this study performance of the FDR (False Discovery Rate) test, which is one of the alternative test for the multiple comparison tests are examined. The significance value according to FDR is compared with the significance value for the t test. 3, 5 and 10 groups for the sample sizes 50, 100 and 200 are compared.

702a6243e1fbe38f2260d8a8cd111ccfb5dfd6ec,Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in a glutamate receptor gene (GRM8) with theta power of event-related oscillations and alcohol dependence.,"Evidence suggests the P3 amplitude of the event-related potential and its underlying superimposed event-related oscillations (EROs), primarily in the theta (4-5 Hz) and delta (1-3 Hz) frequencies, as endophenotypes for the risk of alcoholism and other disinhibitory disorders. Major neurochemical substrates contributing to theta and delta rhythms and P3 involve strong GABAergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic system interactions. The aim of this study was to test the potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in glutamate receptor genes and ERO quantitative traits. GRM8 was selected because it maps at chromosome 7q31.3-q32.1 under the peak region where we previously identified significant linkage (peak LOD = 3.5) using a genome-wide linkage scan of the same phenotype (event-related theta band for the target visual stimuli). Neural activities recorded from scalp electrodes during a visual oddball task in which rare target elicited P3s were analyzed in a subset of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) sample comprising 1,049 Caucasian subjects from 209 families (with 472 DSM-IV alcohol dependent individuals). The family-based association test (FBAT) detected significant association (P < 0.05) with multiple SNPs in the GRM8 gene and event-related theta power to target visual stimuli, and also with alcohol dependence, even after correction for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate (FDR). Our results suggest that variation in GRM8 may be involved in modulating event-related theta oscillations during information processing and also in vulnerability to alcoholism. These findings underscore the utility of electrophysiology and the endophenotype approach in the genetic study of psychiatric disorders.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrew Chih-Hui Chen"", ids = ""49674362""); list(name = ""Yongqiang Tang"", ids = ""46556641""); list(name = ""Madhavi Rangaswamy"", ids = ""1903261""); list(name = ""Jen Chyong Wang"", ids = ""13257161""); list(name = ""Laura Almasy"", ids = ""2907225""); list(name = ""Tatiana Foroud"", ids = ""2065393""); list(name = ""Howard J.

21be14e743a077a7ffcd82efa69b23cfc281ca35,"Statistical significance: p value, 0.05 threshold, and applications to radiomicsâ€”reasons for a conservative approach","Here, we summarise the unresolved debate about p value and its dichotomisation. We present the statement of the American Statistical Association against the misuse of statistical significance as well as the proposals to abandon the use of p value and to reduce the significance threshold from 0.05 to 0.005. We highlight reasons for a conservative approach, as clinical research needs dichotomic answers to guide decision-making, in particular in the case of diagnostic imaging and interventional radiology. With a reduced p value threshold, the cost of research could increase while spontaneous research could be reduced. Secondary evidence from systematic reviews/meta-analyses, data sharing, and cost-effective analyses are better ways to mitigate the false discovery rate and lack of reproducibility associated with the use of the 0.05 threshold. Importantly, when reporting p values, authors should always provide the actual value, not only statements of â€œp < 0.05â€ or â€œp â‰¥ 0.05â€, because p values give a measure of the degree of data compatibility with the null hypothesis.

8bd4f9fe0a891e1802e401c4e28b34810191b10e,Evidence for Network-Based Cortical Thickness Reductions in Schizophrenia.,"OBJECTIVE
Cortical thickness reductions in schizophrenia are irregularly distributed across multiple loci. The authors hypothesized that cortical connectivity networks would explain the distribution of cortical thickness reductions across the cortex, and, specifically, that cortico-cortical connectivity between loci with these reductions would be exceptionally strong and form an interconnected network. This hypothesis was tested in three cross-sectional schizophrenia cohorts: first-episode psychosis, chronic schizophrenia, and treatment-resistant schizophrenia.


METHODS
Structural brain images were acquired for 70 patients with first-episode psychosis, 153 patients with chronic schizophrenia, and 47 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia and in matching healthy control groups (N=57, N=168, and N=54, respectively). Cortical thickness was compared between the patient and respective control groups at 148 regions spanning the cortex. Structural connectivity strength between pairs of cortical regions was quantified with structural covariance analysis. Connectivity strength between regions with cortical thickness reductions was compared with connectivity strength between 5,000 sets of randomly chosen regions to establish whether regions with reductions were interconnected more strongly than would be expected by chance.


RESULTS
Significant (false discovery rate corrected) and widespread cortical thickness reductions were found in the chronic schizophrenia (79 regions) and treatment-resistant schizophrenia (106 regions) groups, with more circumscribed reductions in the first-episode psychosis group (34 regions). Cortical thickness reductions with the largest effect sizes were found in frontal, temporal, cingulate, and insular regions. In all cohorts, both the patient and healthy control groups showed significantly increased structural covariance between regions with cortical thickness reductions compared with randomly selected regions.


CONCLUSIONS
Brain network architecture can explain the irregular topographic distribution of cortical thickness reductions in schizophrenia. This finding, replicated in three distinct schizophrenia cohorts, suggests that the effect is robust and independent of illness stage.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Cassandra M J Wannan"", ids = ""7545514""); list(name = ""Vanessa L.

By proteomics analysis, we identified 1,967 proteins with two or more unique peptides from ONFH and from control bones with a false discovery rate of 4.8%. Using spectral counting, we identified 141 overexpressed and 56 underexpressed proteins comparing ONFH bones to the controls. GSEA (gene set enrichment analysis) revealed that proteins overexpressed in ONFH are enriched for gene sets related to multiple myeloma and adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL), and to JAK2-dependent genes. We confirmed the underexpression of CHST2 (isoform 1 of carbohydrate sulfotransferase 2), a key protein involved in biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and the underexpression of GPCR26 (G-protein coupled receptor 26), a protein that mediates intracellular calcium mobilization, in ONFH bones compared to controls. Taken together, our data suggest that biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and cation transport and mobilization may be a key process involved in the pathogenesis of ONFH.

0aa2112f90fd4d4a1b97bbdaf9791b3c48f66ecf,Computational analysis of copy number profiles of tumors,"Cancer is a genetic disease. The activation, alteration or deactivation of cancer genes can stimulate undesirable cell-proliferation. Cancer genes can be subdivided into oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Oncogenes, such as growth factor receptors, are altered and/or overexpressed genes that are causally linked to tumorigenesis. Tumor suppressors, by contrast, are typically under expressed or deleted in tumors since they would otherwise serve a protective role. There are two main genetic mechanism that can activate or deactivate cancer genes: mutations and DNA copy number alterations. In this work, we focus on detecting novel cancer genes using somatic DNA copy number data. The philosophy is simple: if independently acquired somatic amplifications or deletions occur frequently across multiple tumor samples, they are likely to harbor oncogenes or tumor-suppressors respectively. With a single tumor DNA copy number profile,it is not possible to know which copy number alterations activate or deactivate cancer genes, since many of the alterations (referred to as passenger aberrations) occur due to genomic instability and do not necessarily provide a selective advantage for cancerous cells. However, when aggregating across many samples, we expect cancer genes to be amplified or deleted more frequently than by chance, which allows us to detect them. This application can be regarded as a peak calling problem. We aggregate (sum) copy number profiles across many tumors and call peaks that are significantly high. To do this we define a null model that describes the behavior of an aggregate copy number profile that would arise if only passenger aberrations occurred. The null aggregate profile (also called the noise profile) exhibits high auto correlation across the genome due to the segmented nature of copy number profiles. We therefore developed a statistical framework for calling peaks (at varying widths) where the noise profile can exhibit strong auto correlation. The framework allows us to detect peaks (at varying widths) with high statistical power while controlling the false discovery rate of detected peaks. We employ two concepts. First, we take advantage of the fact that broad peaks can be detected with much higher statistical power when smoothing the profile and we developed techniques for adaptive smoothing. Second, we use a powerful statistic called the expected Euler characteristic that is insensitive to platform resolution, directly compatible with our smoothing methodology and that can be directly used to estimate the expected number of false positive peaks called. This framework does not rely directly on the inherent properties of DNA copy number profiles and can therefore be applied in many more applications with suitably defined null-models. Although the mathematics we develop in this framework might be taxing at times, we observe thatthe equations that result and that are ultimately used in our peak calling algorithms are simple and the validity can easily be verified by simulating data and comparing our theoretical expectations with measured observations.",2019,,"list(name = ""Hekkie van Dyk"", ids = ""50525477"")",,,,,
3b8cee1c21927e94a0ca1f66837618671653c010,"Parallel Gene Expression Changes in Sarcoidosis Involving the Lacrimal Gland, Orbital Tissue, or Blood.","IMPORTANCE
Sarcoidosis is a major cause of ocular or periocular inflammation. The pathogenesis of sarcoidosis is incompletely understood and diagnosis often requires a biopsy.


OBJECTIVE
To determine how gene expression in either orbital adipose tissue or the lacrimal gland affected by sarcoidosis compares with gene expression in other causes of orbital disease and how gene expression in tissue affected by sarcoidosis compares with gene expression in peripheral blood samples obtained from patients with sarcoidosis.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
In a multicenter, international, observational study, gene expression profiling of formalin-fixed biopsy specimens, using GeneChipp U133 Plus 2 microarrays (Affymetrix), was conducted between October 2012 and January 2014 on tissues biopsied from January 2000 through June 2013. Participants included 12 patients with orbital sarcoidosis (7 in adipose tissue; 5 affecting the lacrimal gland) as well as comparable tissue from 6 healthy individuals serving as controls or patients with thyroid eye disease, nonspecific orbital inflammation, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In addition, results were compared with gene expression in peripheral blood samples obtained from 12 historical individuals with sarcoidosis.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Significantly differentially expressed transcripts defined as a minimum of a 1.5-fold increase or a comparable decrease and a false discovery rate of Pâ€‰<â€‰.05.


RESULTS
Signals from 2449 probe sets (transcripts fromâ€‰approximately 1522 genes) were significantly increased in the orbital adipose tissue from patients with sarcoidosis. Signals from 4050 probe sets (approximately 2619 genes) were significantly decreased. Signals from 3069 probe sets (approximately 2001 genes) were significantly higher and 3320 (approximately 2283 genes) were significantly lower in the lacrimal gland for patients with sarcoidosis. Ninety-two probe sets (approximately 69 genes) had significantly elevated signals and 67 probe sets (approximately 56 genes) had significantly lower signals in both orbital tissues and in peripheral blood from patients with sarcoidosis. The transcription factors, interferon-response factor 1, interferon-response factor 2, and nuclear factor ÎºB, were strongly implicated in the expression of messenger RNA upregulated in common in the 3 tissues.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Gene expression in sarcoidosis involving the orbit or lacrimal gland can be distinguished from gene expression patterns in control tissue and overlaps with many transcripts upregulated or downregulated in the peripheral blood of patients with sarcoidosis. These observations suggest that common pathogenic mechanisms contribute to sarcoidosis in different sites. The observations support the hypothesis that a pattern of gene expression profiles could provide diagnostic information in patients with sarcoidosis.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""James T.

6d926457d35abac0b5c8608cdfe42d8132af1abc,Impact of a diet and activity health promotion intervention on regional patterns of DNA methylation,"BackgroundStudies demonstrate the impact of diet and physical activity on epigenetic biomarkers, specifically DNA methylation. However, no intervention studies have examined the combined impact of dietary and activity changes on the blood epigenome. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the Make Better Choices 2 (MBC2) healthy diet and activity intervention on patterns of epigenome-wide DNA methylation. The MBC2 study was a 9-month randomized controlled trial among adults aged 18â€“65 with non-optimal levels of health behaviors. The study compared three 12-week interventions to (1) simultaneously increase exercise and fruit/vegetable intake, while decreasing sedentary leisure screen time; (2) sequentially increase fruit/vegetable intake and decrease leisure screen time first, then increase exercise; (3) increase sleep and decrease stress (control). We collected blood samples at baseline, 3 and 9 months, and measured DNA methylation using the Illumina EPIC (850â€‰k) BeadChip. We examined region-based differential methylation patterns using linear regression models with the false discovery rate of 0.05. We also conducted pathway analysis using gene ontology (GO), KEGG, and IPA canonical pathway databases.ResultsWe found no differences between the MBC2 population (n = 340) and the subsample with DNA methylation measured (n = 68) on baseline characteristics or the impact of the intervention on behavior change. We identified no differentially methylated regions at baseline between the control versus intervention groups. At 3 versus 9 months, we identified 154 and 298 differentially methylated regions, respectively, between controls compared to pooled samples from sequential and simultaneous groups. In the GO database, we identified two gene ontology terms related to hemophilic cell adhesion and cell-cell adhesion. In IPA analysis, we found pathways related to carcinogenesis including PI3K/AKT, Wnt/Î²-catenin, sonic hedgehog, and p53 signaling. We observed an overlap between 3 and 9 months, including the GDP-l-fucose biosynthesis I, methylmalonyl metabolism, and estrogen-mediated cell cycle regulation pathways.ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that the MBC2 diet and physical activity intervention impacts patterns of DNA methylation in gene regions related to cell cycle regulation and carcinogenesis. Future studies will examine DNA methylation as a biomarker to identify populations that may particularly benefit from incorporating health behavior change into plans for precision prevention.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth A.

6e2fd5ea56515f3bb06aab90fbda3ccb1813c490,Long-term phytosterol treatment alters gene expression in the liver of apo E-deficient mice.,"Dietary phytosterols significantly reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-knockout (apo E-KO) mice. We investigated the long-term effects of phytosterol treatment on gene expression in the liver of these mice. Male apo E-KO mice were fed an atherogenic diet supplemented with (n=6) or without (n=6) 2% (wt/wt) phytosterol mixtures for 14 weeks. Liver specimens were collected and stored in RNAlater immediately. mRNA was extracted and subjected to microarray analyses and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for confirmation. Oligonuleotide microarray analysis of pooled samples (n=3) revealed that the expression of 132 genes/transcripts was significantly altered in treated animals, considering the false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.23. Real-time RT-PCR techniques confirmed these alterations in the expression of several of these genes, including Hmgcr (2.16-fold; P=.0002), Hmgcs1 (1.79-fold; P=.001), Hsd17b7 (2.11-fold; P=.028), Sqle (2.03-fold; P=.01), Cyp51 (1.8-fold; P=.001), Fads1 (1.55-fold; P=.031), Fads2 (2.17-fold; P=.047), Lpin1 (3.67-fold; P=.001), Ppargc1b (PGC-1beta; a coactivator of sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins; 1.66-fold; P=.007) and Cyp7B1 (1.81-fold; P=.025). In summary, our data suggest that long-term dietary phytosterols can alter the expression of a number of hepatic genes that regulate sterol metabolism in apo E-KO mice. It is possible that these changes are due to inhibition of cholesterol absorption, but are not a direct effect of plant sterols. Further multivariate correlation or association analysis is needed to establish the relations between changes in the expression of these genes and prevention of atherosclerosis by phytosterols.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zuyuan Xu"", ids = ""48559840""); list(name = ""Khuong Le"", ids = ""5617918""); list(name = ""Mohammed H.

cfc2584cb3ee50d03e5d3df3d840f5ffb6c3a7ab,Gender specific decrease of a set of circulating N-acylphosphatidyl ethanolamines (NAPEs) in the plasma of Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients,"IntroductionCurrent markers of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) fail to detect the early progression of disease state. Conversely, current omics techniques allow the investigation of hundreds of molecules potentially altered by disease conditions. Based on evidence previously collected by our group in a mouse model of PD, we speculated that a particular set of circulating lipids might be significantly altered by the pathology.ObjectivesThe aim of current study was to evaluate the potential of a particular set of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) as potential non-invasive plasma markers of ongoing neurodegeneration from Parkinsonâ€™s disease in human subjects.MethodsA panel of seven NAPEs were quantified by LCâ€“MS/MS in the plasma of 587 individuals (healthy controls, nâ€‰=â€‰319; Parkinsonâ€™s disease, nâ€‰=â€‰268); Random Forest classification and statistical modeling was applied to compare Parkinsonâ€™s disease versus controls. All p-values obtained in different tests were corrected for multiplicity by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR).ResultsThe results indicate that this panel of NAPEs is able to distinguish female PD patients from the corresponding healthy controls. Further to this, the observed downregulation of these NAPEs is in line with the results in plasma of a mouse model of Parkinsonâ€™s (6-OHDA).ConclusionsIn the current study we have shown the downregulation of NAPEs in plasma of PD patients and we thus speculate that these lipids might serve as candidate biomarkers for PD.

To determine whether the plasma levels of a range of inflammatory proteins have utility as biomarkers of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.


METHODS
Plasma proteins (n = 163) were profiled in 44 patients with RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria (22 with active and 22 with quiescent disease) and in 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The utility of a subset of differentially expressed proteins as predictors of RA disease activity was investigated using partial least-squares discriminant analysis, and their response to therapeutic intervention was evaluated in plasma from an additional cohort of 16 patients with active RA treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha).


RESULTS
The protein profiling study identified 25 proteins that were differentially expressed in plasma samples from patients with active RA (P for the false discovery rate < or = 0.01) compared with those with quiescent RA, including the previously described interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M, and IL-2, and the 5 less-established markers macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9, CCL23, transforming growth factor alpha, and CXCL13. Systemic levels of these 5 markers correlated with the C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor level, tender joint count in 68 joints, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), and their combined plasma levels were shown to be good predictors of disease activity (kappa = 0.64). In anti-TNFalpha-treated RA patients, plasma levels of CXCL13 were reduced after 1 and 7 days of therapy, and levels of CCL23, M-CSF, and CXCL13 showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the DAS28 score.


CONCLUSION
This exploratory study for biomarker discovery led to the identification of several proteins predictive of RA disease activity that may be useful in the definition of disease subphenotypes and in the measurement of response to therapy in clinical studies.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Inmaculada Rioja"", ids = ""2589024""); list(name = ""F.

d569ca96a53e0ca37ce0e6d566e0339059210dec,Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression in Murine Fetal and Adult Wounds.,"Objective: In early gestation, fetal wounds heal without fibrosis in a process resembling regeneration. Elucidating this remarkable mechanism can result in tremendous benefits to prevent scarring. Fetal mouse cutaneous wounds before embryonic day (E)18 heal without scar. Herein, we analyze expression profiles of fetal and postnatal wounds utilizing updated gene annotations and pathway analysis to further delineate between repair and regeneration. Approach: Dorsal wounds from time-dated pregnant BALB/c mouse fetuses and adult mice at various time points were collected. Total RNA was isolated and microarray analysis was performed using chips with 42,000 genes. Significance analysis of microarrays was utilized to select genes with >2-fold expression differences with a false discovery rate of <2. Enrichment analysis was performed on significant genes to identify differentially expressed pathways. Results: Our analysis identified 471 differentially expressed genes in fetal versus adult wounds following injury. Utilizing enrichment analysis of significant genes, we identified the top 20 signaling pathways that were upregulated and downregulated at 1 and 12â€‰h after injury. At 24â€‰h after injury, we discovered 18 signaling pathways upregulated in adult wounds and 11 pathways upregulated in fetal wounds. Innovation: These novel target genes and pathways may reveal repair mechanisms of the early fetus that promote regeneration over fibrosis. Conclusion: Our microarray analysis recognizes hundreds of possible genes as candidates for regulators of scarless versus scarring wound repair. Enrichment analysis reveals 109 signaling pathways related to fetal scarless wound healing.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael S Hu"", ids = ""6265041""); list(name = ""Wan Xing Hong"", ids = ""32868227""); list(name = ""Michael Januszyk"", ids = ""3460851""); list(name = ""Graham G Walmsley"", ids = ""4968716""); list(name = ""Anna Luan"", ids = ""4677176""); list(name = ""Zeshaan N.

We compare the expression at peripheral level of84 genes involved in the NF-ÎºÎ² pathway among asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (AC) and HAM/TSP patients. mRNA from PBMCs was isolated from 12 HTLV-1 carriers classified into three groups: fourAC (=patients without any neurological condition) and eight patients with HAM/TSP (four with EDSS scores of 1-5 and four with EDSS score of 5.5-9.0). 84 genes related to the NF-ÎºÎ² pathway were evaluated using Superarray plates (SABiosciences) and Real Time PCR in both groups. Ct values under 35 were considered positive, False Discovery Rate was used to control by multiple comparisons. Three genes were dysregulated in HAM/TSP patients. The expression level of NF-ÎºÎ²IA was higher in AC compared to HAM/TSP patients, while EGR1 and IL-8 showed a lower expression in AC compared to HAM/TSP patients (p<0.05 after multiple testing correction).

We present LuciPHOr2, a site localization tool for generic post-translational modifications (PTMs) using tandem mass spectrometry data. As an extension of the original LuciPHOr (version 1) for phosphorylation site localization, the new software provides a site-level localization score for generic PTMs and associated false discovery rate called the false localization rate. We describe several novel features such as operating system independence and reduced computation time through multiple threading. We also discuss optimal parameters for different types of data and illustrate the new tool on a human skeletal muscle dataset for lysine-acetylation.

e6fbd7ab20bfabe0c9a7818f1751eb34e174190a,Rare variants analysis using penalization methods for whole genome sequence data,"BackgroundAvailability of affordable and accessible whole genome sequencing for biomedical applications poses a number of statistical challenges and opportunities, particularly related to the analysis of rare variants and sparseness of the data. Although efforts have been devoted to address these challenges, the performance of statistical methods for rare variants analysis still needs further consideration.ResultWe introduce a new approach that applies restricted principal component analysis with convex penalization and then selects the best predictors of a phenotype by a concave penalized regression model, while estimating the impact of each genomic region on the phenotype. Using simulated data, we show that the proposed method maintains good power for association testing while keeping the false discovery rate low under a verity of genetic architectures. Illustrative data analyses reveal encouraging result of this method in comparison with other commonly applied methods for rare variants analysis.ConclusionBy taking into account linkage disequilibrium and sparseness of the data, the proposed method improves power and controls the false discovery rate compared to other commonly applied methods for rare variant analyses.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Akram Yazdani"", ids = ""3142289""); list(name = ""Azam Yazdani"", ids = ""8621949""); list(name = ""Eric Boerwinkle"", ids = ""2918432"")",fc77343caadacbe2dfc68df0fc6b735a50a35599; 4bdfb3c56f73f6c71a307bda52e6eaa44ded9f2e; 3b4a4b1661eeee59efde6683acefa2e9974fa053; b9ca0188d806683d1acc6d518a8174105ac85068; 5a2d1837efaba0ecafa346abc8b52d6821f98222; 1156163286f9dff079548202afa45a41509e7a3c; 485091c42a9327fb6ba6cf14b379a6ec4c3a1ca8; be58f7e4d99c9624d061fdb04f9fb81f0f939e30,3345c4c622b475e76e77980917804e7aac928ca9; a487c664b21fd199054b7821f651ff63c8c1195b; eb131f2de2eeed88f8b3512a7961b668f7fa52a6; 0025fc4f00c21960297fbdf83220d6bde75da645; 7953ea921cbd3c62cac3004dafcd630e31eae81d; 57268e2fb7349828c35a745715f45d5cdf56a1de; e28ba0fd6ea94bd56f277d3a89de8f47fd5d1943; 7d804a3b8bca0be5678535ee3c0c4ce290237d3a; 66d66172c596fa420c34b2745bbf1776bd4e8d33; 9221f6aa7e6bc041adedf43893025725b09c37b5; d060daf59842a70bc6b12b1bf14ab04e35b90b2c; 31a7315d97641b1ee1e065000a0f528bcb25e39b; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; 019b126e45001dbfc28e72943449bc42bd08df7b; 72341671a75f11e53061ed44fe534905924801fa; 2ab96aa64f95c7199200a15b65d76fb81c3a0c8e; 2537fda5ac2baa8ab61d48415e6fd5915ebe2c17; 3b1f2f37499095597a1eb2fa2aa0ad0f6563f4d2; c2831e134a352a298dfd9a1ae31b8164066e1cb4; e800bd183290b5838a9ca69ef34504323eb1113b; 71c7b296a791347b433acd7a4eb7c6c1e4b03038; 2ac4798550e64fa1291ff9bd3af0ca5e23ba2fdb; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; a0e4c039ad1175bd2c451a6d52337e00269bdca6; 4c7829be98c15d7a27cab47e9c1b2017fb4fe55f; 619518eddc515e3cf306cd66fe3866cbf9843fc7; 5d72ad3c372ef741697382b75d0be5e91a73fa3b; 4f607f03272e4d62708f5b2441355f9e005cb452; d62c5724e19cdc3437145f6e22012373e2deb3bc; 2351e5fe0f1be7fbbee0c9a6e704ab929ace51de; 01fa33e00712a8ab927457ee8e8bbef8f88bf38f; 80fc7ffcfbc635351d51c8cbf99c366220f11a06; 1877e3ac4d18448f263030aab7d42f9f1aa3599e; b0cdd840ab8ac9717a8dc69e05c8bd1eb41256e0; 65c3c5cd1bdd878812fe8c71cc6840faf9804743; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 78b29c4f30e0d98c4fdd29d58a5c2cf2b241cb90; a397933f32a5ffc6b42ddeb19a6638ef27432951; 077befac5cc9916877014628507d1da484a92343; 3902de5f0059d63c9b8919b194c85fb7d9b42a6a; 0344ac25ea2e9834b712d42109e9a1251005c666; 2ea1be0a88b027a39a308ca3ff71fe740b04c282,BMC Bioinformatics,16,
083a97a9befd5e34c9d3ee915d3e602466ab8828,Oncoviruses Can Drive Cancer by Rewiring Signaling Pathways Through Interface Mimicry,"Oncoviruses rewire host pathways to subvert host immunity and promote their survival and proliferation. However, exactly how is challenging to understand. Here, by employing the first and to date only interface-based host-microbe interaction (HMI) prediction method, we explore a pivotal strategy oncoviruses use to drive cancer: mimicking binding surfaces-interfaces-of human proteins. We show that oncoviruses can target key human network proteins and transform cells by acquisition of cancer hallmarks. Experimental large-scale mapping of HMIs is difficult and individual HMIs do not permit in-depth grasp of tumorigenic virulence mechanisms. Our computational approach is tractable and 3D structural HMI models can help elucidate pathogenesis mechanisms and facilitate drug design. We observe that many host proteins are unique targets for certain oncoviruses, whereas others are common to several, suggesting similar infectious strategies. A rough estimation of our false discovery rate based on the tissue expression of oncovirus-targeted human proteins is 25%.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emine Guven-Maiorov"", ids = ""1409232157""); list(name = ""Chung-Jung Tsai"", ids = ""2616135""); list(name = ""Ruth Nussinov"", ids = ""1805230"")",,e2cb818521ccc6287525fae130b40a7b511714b3; 515ee49864ef7a3d6770aae8a4aecc61642e38f3; da6e0f64030c96791bff682c33b584d095da58f4; f6a6818aa8ec5e93233d78c8a6dfe4d545b505a3; 1b1727d25d5562042e60df4b4f088d7351c95cc1; fac297b4a2f12c8383c92052ec1ec3f3820d0fe9; 567d473142fb3fdb2a033f94033f8fd166f9a895; 8dc7d69600283dbdeecc4e60b587a22e4f63a298; 2b92797f4df991cafecfd44d3c09f897dc62fe06; e9a53ace75f8d18168bf754d7940171774a6dd2f; 387c8b4330b8280da8bf1ff71675c83574c68e67; c30907b6503e6c46345d454940f8321a5fcc3390; a54329b0188aa5e6f5296389265453bf94cb3c06; b7f1715c38cea7902610c225ac6f40f59550fb78; 0fdea99acfaa475a81b66b63a80f2e04475aefe1; eb69fc3e63086cbf16fa156eef314d187ca0832b; cbb5c19ab8fbc5eb05a24916f8d38cddb4253bd9; 76d123c4cd0f07a90ad118e0f8e28fb6aafd7ba6; 8e600778160ff986b5460bc2584066148e55e5d4; 3866bcf05c9e8882ead9bb9c711aab90bc396a0a; 58a644bf5ea9b1a8c5d97c8cf72c70d908365323; a64f82fed8aac0552ce62bd7e3d1ae3f7f4ba4d2; 89eb2379609cb4ee5636867cb2bb78bae0fc375f; 0fbd107cb06622f80f82aac24eb78119f00879e5; 104beada9892fd78ebc65d0dab78a0f152e48ff9; fc3085e14760202c4257785875f7127e85acfb5c; aa40b0b19b356fde32f8d665dff87108c569a210; cbb85efeef4edae32b35b9cf93aad5966c30a437; a6d387a919008c9020673139877bd7ac5672d49f; db2e494f475786cff65f54df155c30e98798a60d; 03ec4187004a5d9d0d5f5972ab63d50aa7a2979f; c6a71c2d307ed14de6d51f2b8606c09b3686bdae; fd1e9de826d2b90cb37ab53242e29b33f613e873; c74b51e61cb8cb383e0fda51cc58873fdfe5096b; f1223647ccae3edb2e64c5d488eaf476462866f5; 4012ff097df16c0fb4502e606975e1a2b9cfd8ee; 684ea4f71fb465fe681d1b7d81533fa7c295f42d; f424217581764375b061dcf340bf2157afefd3a4; 4178604fb7e4dca4760d191bb0e8c20e09ccfaca; 8f825df366f6bba6d0505e1e621dabe0288473d5; 875eb70e71276002039f6b6ba7150f9c30c11ebe; 23e41a7de87c667a99ae887cacd6f0a5f1e8adda; 4a6a3235a5422d7365b2c0166af19f191fb566fd; 3ef5f2b8bd31f74685d80430e4e3e42031c602a4; 3d7112ad58bc7806d77fe669215679ce0c9e4837; d0fd1a802e3331d7eb693d2b2513c2166c126d26; 23f02ec72876f9f25fdfc049291aad7da40bfee7; c769a3c4a5ddcc66b5c14cdee018e4d5b6aeeca4; ad27bdd5c04f88aaa3149d9b5c928e9b4ee1be6a; adbd20024c2cabf83d1510776e9d337f4fc43dbd; 4712a43df5e44d53a2b51dcab06c87021b013a45; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; b74b2a2436ed300a16eb3c50cde356fe053211c4; 16dd3dae2d551658aa33300f54f251f2dbc16a97; bf6af1d82112f6b023e011562035c855b90776f8; de4c9a0b5f81d145905a7900d53cccf61e6fbeb4; db8018f1c63848d06c2bbe87956a138218e11aed; 05ed69cf5694fd8d59ade52f8ddcb5616886f18d; 2e348ceb394d17e068b9d5e91305dc32cee78bfb; 835c36689778a04937c3b5ac59a98bcaefa4ad8b; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 5497828864db69c1cf6881939f4b0e0f5a083ed7; f4576f70193dd11160c0538d650aa88bef48a466; 94412787a7d17712d8d5723ea6de5937e30df557; 7e7b8987ed6ee48f031309bb3e29efc355710451; 3f91e5f01dacbdebc8805c996f4d699e5b471b70; 38dab1cc0a84aac4fe0e3030d4fea3fdebc94973; 03911394dc3a96ff6a6de61718e8a7552a873fe1; f0fb932e42aa4450a3b5984e5f39b0fc5143e5b0; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 3eac11ab59887bcd4b958d5fb101dcb0a45da44f; aa95b1bc8a74d20ff5f3b0dce450c3cda6b7f28c; 1752016687131769c5ba96a77ebbdf4bc8016b4a; c6d8bfb6252eeed4096a87237da82daad84069fa; a0dde584464d035f9f0f2cd2415963d471ecb796; 0c9b96cf1e1a1026669f99d92a350939281affb4; f9b43685abcb1d8e8486c9d56f1beae377e9383b; 0c78a74f75318c1189b9931192409a89460d6e73; d8c302d6551b21e0e0826795ab69630ad522a861; 788825e7f77497c4c5ede075a23eeb2e77433174; 6ad8bededcfe5c0a855c86a30447b2bd081de1a7; 4c3759ef67bc7fce683049770126ec7aafade29f; a03b3f56cfc64dc4c1e66d3dcf09298f138f060d; bebd70927a1b3e8c5c6bd65d7947ada469506346; 54f7ca03b906127d86c4ddf46c4e2c9cdfefae2d; bc6c3f86635900dd99456fb9745c5b8a75c55312; 3721b9c09666c439552d517e17b3f2900e84b1ad; 65ff35e3fe942c42ce98ed0d12537e04f0b851c4; 784570b825c839fdbd3faad87ff8bd1dedf3e795; ad1a86179c1fb4c447fb8dc8c330b8a7b1515a61,Frontiers in Oncology,9,

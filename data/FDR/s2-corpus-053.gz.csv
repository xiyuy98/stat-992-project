3395894cba530891aa9e66f7f030efe4224691af,A framework for significance analysis of gene expression data using dimension reduction methods,"BackgroundThe most popular methods for significance analysis on microarray data are well suited to find genes differentially expressed across predefined categories. However, identification of features that correlate with continuous dependent variables is more difficult using these methods, and long lists of significant genes returned are not easily probed for co-regulations and dependencies. Dimension reduction methods are much used in the microarray literature for classification or for obtaining low-dimensional representations of data sets. These methods have an additional interpretation strength that is often not fully exploited when expression data are analysed. In addition, significance analysis may be performed directly on the model parameters to find genes that are important for any number of categorical or continuous responses. We introduce a general scheme for analysis of expression data that combines significance testing with the interpretative advantages of the dimension reduction methods. This approach is applicable both for explorative analysis and for classification and regression problems.ResultsThree public data sets are analysed. One is used for classification, one contains spiked-in transcripts of known concentrations, and one represents a regression problem with several measured responses. Model-based significance analysis is performed using a modified version of Hotelling's T2-test, and a false discovery rate significance level is estimated by resampling. Our results show that underlying biological phenomena and unknown relationships in the data can be detected by a simple visual interpretation of the model parameters. It is also found that measured phenotypic responses may model the expression data more accurately than if the design-parameters are used as input. For the classification data, our method finds much the same genes as the standard methods, in addition to some extra which are shown to be biologically relevant. The list of spiked-in genes is also reproduced with high accuracy.ConclusionThe dimension reduction methods are versatile tools that may also be used for significance testing. Visual inspection of model components is useful for interpretation, and the methodology is the same whether the goal is classification, prediction of responses, feature selection or exploration of a data set. The presented framework is conceptually and algorithmically simple, and a Matlab toolbox (Mathworks Inc, USA) is supplemented.",2006,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lars Halvor Gidskehaug"", ids = ""3185163""); list(name = ""Endre Anderssen"", ids = ""143854452""); list(name = ""Arnar Flatberg"", ids = ""3118673""); list(name = ""BjÃ¸rn K.

79347a0524e972bba99b10603de5b0f0bbd5c8f6,Regional effects of lamotrigine on cerebral glucose metabolism in idiopathic generalized epilepsy.,"BACKGROUND
Antiepileptic drugs have been reported to affect cerebral metabolism. We performed (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) before and after lamotrigine administration to investigate its effects on cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with drug-naÃ¯ve idiopathic generalized epilepsy.


DESIGN
We included patients who were newly diagnosed as having idiopathic generalized epilepsy or who had not taken an antiepileptic drug after the diagnosis was made. Antiepileptic drug (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PETs were obtained before and after lamotrigine administration in 21 subjects (male-female ratio, 10:11; mean +/- SD age, 24.3 +/- 2.8 years). The mean lamotrigine dosage was 211.9 mg/d (range, 175.0-275.0 mg/d). For statistical parametric mapping analysis, all PET images were spatially normalized to the standard PET template and then smoothed using a 14-mm full width at half-maximum gaussian kernel. The paired t test was used to compare premedication and postmedication (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucoae PET images.


RESULTS
After lamotrigine administration, cerebral metabolism was decreased in bilateral thalami, bilateral caudate nuclei, the left side of the putamen, the left entorhinal area, bilateral parahippocampal gyri, the right inferior temporal gyrus, the left rectosubcallosal gyrus, bilateral superior frontal gyri, the left middle frontal gyrus, the right precentral gyrus, left pericentral gyri, the right superior parietal lobule, and bilateral substantia nigra at P<.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate approach. No brain region showed increased metabolism after lamotrigine administration.


CONCLUSION
This study revealed that lamotrigine treatment reduces glucose metabolism in the thalamus, basal ganglia, and multiple regions of the cerebral cortex in drug-naÃ¯ve patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eun Yeon Joo"", ids = ""1920146""); list(name = ""Woo Suk Tae"", ids = ""5316406""); list(name = ""Seung Bong Hong"", ids = ""3018797"")",b13c6fe3d6e73818279ccb1c0d1d3369386e0d28; 2e9eeb1e8bb034fc185d55f9b02913895ff061a6; 25329e9d6c2d41f7e3cf02f9e2e0a79c0e165e52; d387e6492281c9b9323d83120214c4ee95ab0b41; 26d22a00de032cdc6b0f5830aa90d541da9417a1; c2d724100e1fff691a6090fe24bac7853438762c; ec4179989440ca62c1f6c6beef34bf6f0b8019bd; 85325be5e06a7b021716ec64af4f75f518e21562; e129e9b2546e0679d39b31e2307b2069993a781a,9c48b36a68b94d74797246b1aea86e2188aa585f; 03a629423909d96e77956790862e36ab4c61ed5f; faf14909afc6d08f36ac578d2387e6871661e7bd; f46b3507aeb5936e6b273afcd5f2f370cf7ca6b9; 590152fdb2a1a5c83552b97fa05ba068ba42aec8; 2f47e2e060ffb64c43d65a461f3402d63dc7af71; c7894da8c0b92767333c6111b371ff50f821297d; 6e35c7473f3eb880689e25fc866c8343815b0d27; 24929eb697e91ebb2a3babec34394acfe57a189e; 754c5c24bc97da58db5cc43516eff2789008a752; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 94dee00b144f6f822b8d8786eeaff35f7901c8a1; a4816f34647a4a0df97c20afd1f87ea9bb6c1475; ce209a65d2d6fc89062268e389dcef859d8cfa59; 65b7c24e3f9bab9f1b768bedfe4e39ae58944ed1; d3ae0f484ba3637fab6de04df13fb976160b4fe8; 032a3f6d8268ded8ac1bd0b4db47b7a78f81ecec; 1bbbd22e2a1c654fe44cf01e76af4d2c0f3bd9f0; 4ccb329e9fb66c0347a2d9c10caa30475f66504b; 4ec6a0f35ddc40078c5decab973c9bfeea5674fb; 1247d77193de2e99491c20059e329f5ab64be4c9; a36a73c2d1363f7a769c3ec4eb79e60566193979; a29f170ebe1aabc94cf028c94275c96e5284657b; 600ad1b86ce21ecb07cde8f0a3e4fe715cf3ae16; 54f06dd0029e3fd6ddd23fb24ce7301f6c96b49e,Archives of neurology,63 9,"

139e71d5500ad5439e2a9d612580d63d5170f90d,Cardiac resynchronization therapy corrects dyssynchrony-induced regional gene expression changes on a genomic level.,"BACKGROUND
Cardiac electromechanical dyssynchrony causes regional disparities in workload, oxygen consumption, and myocardial perfusion within the left ventricle. We hypothesized that such dyssynchrony also induces region-specific alterations in the myocardial transcriptome that are corrected by cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).


METHODS AND RESULTS
Adult dogs underwent left bundle branch ablation and right atrial pacing at 200 bpm for either 6 weeks (dyssynchronous heart failure, n=12) or 3 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of resynchronization by biventricular pacing at the same pacing rate (CRT, n=10). Control animals without left bundle branch block were not paced (n=13). At 6 weeks, RNA was isolated from the anterior and lateral left ventricular (LV) walls and hybridized onto canine-specific 44K microarrays. Echocardiographically, CRT led to a significant decrease in the dyssynchrony index, while dyssynchronous heart failure and CRT animals had a comparable degree of LV dysfunction. In dyssynchronous heart failure, changes in gene expression were primarily observed in the anterior LV, resulting in increased regional heterogeneity of gene expression within the LV. Dyssynchrony-induced expression changes in 1050 transcripts were reversed by CRT to levels of nonpaced hearts (false discovery rate <5%). CRT remodeled transcripts with metabolic and cell signaling function and greatly reduced regional heterogeneity of gene expression as compared with dyssynchronous heart failure.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results demonstrate a profound effect of electromechanical dyssynchrony on the regional cardiac transcriptome, causing gene expression changes primarily in the anterior LV wall. CRT corrected the alterations in gene expression in the anterior wall, supporting a global effect of biventricular pacing on the ventricular transcriptome that extends beyond the pacing site in the lateral wall.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andreas S.

0711e18af251b3412c639e8a23ef111f9751e79b,Common genetic variants in cell cycle pathway are associated with survival in stage III-IV non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Cell cycle progression contributes to the cellular response to DNA-damaging factors, such as chemotherapy and radiation. We hypothesized that the genetic variations in cell cycle pathway genes may modulate treatment responses and affect survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We genotyped 374 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 49 cell cycle-related genes in 598 patients with stages III-IV NSCLC treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy with/without radiation. We analyzed the individual and combined associations of these SNPs with survival and evaluated their gene-gene interactions using survival tree analysis. In the analysis of survival in all the patients, 39 SNPs reached nominal significance (P < 0.05) and 4 SNPs were significant at P <0.01. However, none of these SNPs remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons at a false discovery rate of 10%. In stratified analysis by treatment modality, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, nine SNPs in chemotherapy alone and one SNP in chemoradiation remained significant. The most significant SNP in chemotherapy group was CCNB2:rs1486878 [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.25-2.30, P = 0.001]. TP73: rs3765701 was the only significant SNP in chemoradiation group (HR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.35-2.59, P = 1.8 Ã— 10(-4)). In cumulative analysis, we found a significant gene-dosage effect in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Survival tree analysis demonstrated potential higher order gene-gene and gene-treatment interactions, which could be used to predict survival status based on distinct genetic signatures. These results suggest that genetic variations in cell cycle pathway genes may affect the survival of patients with stages III-IV NSCLC individually and jointly.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jikai Yin"", ids = ""33398097""); list(name = ""Charles Lu"", ids = ""145903681""); list(name = ""Jian Gu"", ids = ""1931513""); list(name = ""Scott Michael Lippman"", ids = ""2352238""); list(name = ""Michelle A.

We performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)-based analyses using the multi-level information provided in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Of the factors we measured, cis-acting eQTLs accounted for 1.2% of the total variation of tumor gene expression, while somatic copy-number alteration and CpG methylation accounted for 7.3% and 3.3%, respectively. eQTL analyses of 15 previously reported breast cancer risk loci resulted in the discovery of three variants that are significantly associated with transcript levels (false discovery rate [FDR]Â < 0.1). Our trans-based analysis identified an additional three risk loci to act through ESR1, MYC, and KLF4. These findings provide a more comprehensive picture of gene expression determinants in breast cancer as well as insights into the underlying biology of breast cancer risk loci.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Qiyuan Li"", ids = ""40531076""); list(name = ""Ji-Heui Seo"", ids = ""46844928""); list(name = ""Barbara E.

9a7067d35ac4837a13a4cb6537d181ce836f60f0,Epigenome-wide association study of asthma and wheeze characterizes loci within HK 1,"Background: To identify novel epigenetic markers of adolescent asthma and replicate findings in an independent cohort, then explore whether such markers are detectable at birth, predictive of early-life wheeze, and associated with gene expression in cord blood. Methods: We performed epigenome-wide screening with recursive random forest feature selection and internal validation in the IOW birth cohort. We then tested whether we could replicate these findings in the independent cohort ALSPAC and followed-up our top finding with children of the IOW cohort. Results: We identified 10 CpG sites associated with adolescent asthma at a 5% false discovery rate (IOW, n = 370), five of which exhibited evidence of associations in the replication study (ALSPAC, n = 720). One site, cg16658191, within HK1 displayed particularly strong associations after cellular heterogeneity adjustments in both cohorts (ORIOW = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04â€“0.57) (ORALSPAC = 0.57, 95% CI 0.38â€“0.87). Additionally, higher expression of HK1 (OR = 3.81, 95% CI 1.41â€“11.77) in cord blood was predictive of wheezing in infancy (n = 82). Conclusion: We identified novel associations between asthma and wheeze with methylation at cg16658191 and the expression of HK1, which may serve as markers of, predictors of, and potentially etiologic factors involved in asthma and early life wheeze.",2019,,"list(name = ""Todd M.

cf40c163aedab3ce3ea65992b9a2f852b2546355,Systematic evaluation of environmental and behavioural factors associated with all-cause mortality in the United States national health and nutrition examination survey.,"BACKGROUND
Environmental and behavioural factors are thought to contribute to all-cause mortality. Here, we develop a method to systematically screen and validate the potential independent contributions to all-cause mortality of 249 environmental and behavioural factors in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).


METHODS
We used Cox proportional hazards regression to associate 249 factors with all-cause mortality while adjusting for sociodemographic factors on data in the 1999-2000 and 2001-02 surveys (median 5.5 follow-up years). We controlled for multiple comparisons with the false discovery rate (FDR) and validated significant findings in the 2003-04 survey (median 2.8 follow-up years). We selected 249 factors from a set of all possible factors based on their presence in both the 1999-2002 and 2003-04 surveys and linkage with at least 20 deceased participants. We evaluated the correlation pattern of validated factors and built a multivariable model to identify their independent contribution to mortality.


RESULTS
We identified seven environmental and behavioural factors associated with all-cause mortality, including serum and urinary cadmium, serum lycopene levels, smoking (3-level factor) and physical activity. In a multivariable model, only physical activity, past smoking, smoking in participant's home and lycopene were independently associated with mortality. These three factors explained 2.1% of the variance of all-cause mortality after adjusting for demographic and socio-economic factors.


CONCLUSIONS
Our association study suggests that, of the set of 249 factors in NHANES, physical activity, smoking, serum lycopene and serum/urinary cadmium are associated with all-cause mortality as identified in previous studies and after controlling for multiple hypotheses and validation in an independent survey. Whereas other NHANES factors may be associated with mortality, they may require larger cohorts with longer time of follow-up to detect. It is possible to use a systematic association study to prioritize risk factors for further investigation.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chirag J.

4d616deaed763d37ceb12f6d9dded80e1e6c2c05,Multiple Hypotheses Testing For Variable Selection,"Many methods have been developed to estimate the set of relevant variables in a sparse linear model Y= XB+e where the dimension p of B can be much higher than the length n of Y. Here we propose two new methods based on multiple hypotheses testing, either for ordered or non-ordered variables. Our procedures are inspired by the testing procedure proposed by Baraud et al (2003). The new procedures are proved to be powerful under some conditions on the signal and their properties are non asymptotic. They gave better results in estimating the set of relevant variables than both the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and the Lasso, both in the common case (p n).",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Florian Rohart"", ids = ""50704309"")",caa5c3d3251e1665e116d6ab3d06b51d33aa1a67; 924ab3b9c707ca6b7757ab4a06059084cef22638; 6dedefb40ffab2aba7da20d8dd193b73948990f3; df5f8ec435ced294153336358d242b5d0a3ccad0; 4179795d859594b5935781ec308ea84968fdb868; c613ca08fe25a8a8b8b82ce8b0bfd4a1d8e3ee2b; 358c4e7e53fcd9c2feb7e0ae133c8ece9ed6d240; 4f2e6c28ed70751a0ffb93b8d0da07954698cf3e,aab69038d3127b3da132c3b0d67cce79c63ef944; a5572ecac91158bea978d56a4341820ec2e4be2b; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; ccdfb9985ce6c83428715bc93dd5eb325a785b74; e40b44e4f20d185a9b09e29ffd11cb0f5977b63b; 10b6bf1f08cdf768030f27ab0c22bb768eda82cd; c8500a3d46b791803a96537e9d5e05479020bd5f; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; f6ce2c3102440b9869025456b11cfbc9a46c7e82; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 84ae72f4ef81ada08ad57a089176c0dfaa0a6d19; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,245-267
b382a4b37e84648b32aa61a917dd251edd8662c0,"An Unsupervised, Model-Free, Machine-Learning Combiner for Peptide Identifications from Tandem Mass Spectra","As the speed of mass spectrometers, sophistication of sample fractionation, and complexity of experimental designs increase, the volume of tandem mass spectra requiring reliable automated analysis continues to grow. Software tools that quickly, effectively, and robustly determine the peptide associated with each spectrum with high confidence are sorely needed. Currently available tools that postprocess the output of sequence-database search engines use three techniques to distinguish the correct peptide identifications from the incorrect: statistical significance re-estimation, supervised machine learning scoring and prediction, and combining or merging of search engine results. We present a unifying framework that encompasses each of these techniques in a single model-free machine-learning framework that can be trained in an unsupervised manner. The predictor is trained on the fly for each new set of search results without user intervention, making it robust for different instruments, search engines, and search engine parameters. We demonstrate the performance of the technique using mixtures of known proteins and by using shuffled databases to estimate false discovery rates, from data acquired on three different instruments with two different ionization technologies. We show that this approach outperforms machine-learning techniques applied to a single search engineâ€™s output, and demonstrate that combining search engine results provides additional benefit. We show that the performance of the commercial Mascot tool can be bested by the machine-learning combination of two open-source tools X!Tandem and OMSSA, but that the use of all three search engines boosts performance further still. The Peptide identification Arbiter by Machine Learning (PepArML) unsupervised, model-free, combining framework can be easily extended to support an arbitrary number of additional searches, search engines, or specialized peptideâ€“spectrum match metrics for each spectrum data set.

Methods: Biocompatibility of a new polymer-coated (SEC-coated) CPB circuit was globally evaluated and compared with that of a non-coated CPB circuit by quantitative proteomics, using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma samples were taken three times (5 min after initiation of CPB, just before declamping and just before termination of CPB) in 12 pigs undergoing 120 min of CPB with the SEC-coated CPB circuit or a non-coated CPB circuit (n = 6, respectively). Results: Identified were 224 proteins having high protein confidence (>99%) and false discovery rate (FDR) <5%. Among these proteins, there were 25 significantly upregulated proteins in the non-coated CPB group compared to those in the SEC-coated CPB group. Dominant protein functions were platelet degranulation, serine-type (cysteine-type) endopeptidase inhibitor activity and serine-type endopeptidase activity in the 25 proteins. Bioinformatics analysis similarly revealed upregulation of proteins belonging to platelet degranulation and negative regulation of endopeptidase activity in the non-coated CPB group; these upregulations were effectively attenuated in the SEC-coated CPB group. Conclusion: The new polymer (SEC)-coated CPB circuit effectively attenuated upregulation of proteins compared to the non-coated CPB circuit. These proteins were associated with both proteases/protease inhibitors and platelet degranulation.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shoichi Suehiro"", ids = ""13516454""); list(name = ""Kouji Shimizu"", ids = ""11096506""); list(name = ""Kensuke Imai"", ids = ""46376364""); list(name = ""Atsushi Niii"", ids = ""11258852""); list(name = ""Kazuhiro Akeho"", ids = ""13980690""); list(name = ""Hayato Nakata"", ids = ""37259645""); list(name = ""Akane Yamaguchi"", ids = ""6108518""); list(name = ""Ken-ichi Matsumoto"", ids = ""46688148""); list(name = ""Teiji Oda"", ids = ""49188702"")",ea0bcfe73faf1d6b9ab6facf6cfa82dea68f172c,4f3d1b00ac3b1ec1541021b3001d2aa43a60d503; 7620c8da439b26c624ebd81de0665e41e9c91d86; b179dee7c1ca783a506ba152f5884c91e901cb87; da31b1e16ac2beef643b7e263fef6e2452318b6f; 58fa38bc6e458e41a452438a4d1ac75bc8a7be6d; 895eea31c9df4dae67c64c99dfb88927b1270caf; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 91d08608c38d173373093c860078589ba72b672c; 20504b10a66e2b9d5cb7e70bdf709a7486b3fefa; 406c926025d9822066e990ada791b298fc3f002a; d77edd7b541855f2503e2b901ec3119aee7bac19; f2d6020998cf27851b7205cc89d8362cd3f8e2bf; 8b4c3503fc502324ecd4e9c87e2481eaddee14a9; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; c2e4dcc70888952f9f38c74dba6ac52362eda942; ef720c1e6f9c0521a3fd1942a8b403f839ea8478; 411d4f62b1adf73f8e7fde2916d29a02ccc7ff95; 3a25e97cdc69afc4dacdddaf63b39217dc001f82; 86d25572363c4e36a0e134ef8178499be6d52554; de1db0273b453255d6daf69e2416325105ef0057; 1ca06e0a87f3aab7e2aa942e9f6e61800960f2ba; 3618525eeb4d84054b8352290f9d538b80f8b9bf; 0bd6f77272ecf38859bf1ae5d6c765e49e13bb91; 8fbf9854568c1007e069844086b6dbf4a4e06192; c9862500a2c401d99fad739153298b81e4e69cce; 42dfe27c5b6a77772fc03145c4fd3f24729c9ac0; 6b1a97371a20c31dd0041b1b14259ee1c0914bdd; 36ee9bf7f3a8455809deb60a450fdc261f5c3400; 8998be049b28422b691fdea0780a1334d871cae3; 0007d877f8eff3f8bdc7c63af08b8e06276c1860; bb82694c9e5c141cb2fc14cdb530dee770f3cd83; ce11b2565a5833e7b03b7c93875f413cb3b00fe3; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 825f8fd395d5951cb1ec493d706e1541ec159009,Perfusion,32,645 - 655

eaf299fa4016a70a24a685dbc757b8320dd30e73,Statistical estimation and testing via the sorted L1 norm,"We introduce a novel method for sparse regression and variable selection, which is inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. Imagine we have observations from the linear model y = X beta + z, then we suggest estimating the regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called SLOPE, which is the solution to minimize 0.5 ||y - Xb\|_2^2 + lambda_1 |b|_(1) + lambda_2 |b|_(2) + ... + lambda_p |b|_(p); here, lambda_1 >= \lambda_2 >= ... >= \lambda_p >= 0 and |b|_(1) >= |b|_(2) >= ... >= |b|_(p) is the order statistic of the magnitudes of b. The regularizer is a sorted L1 norm which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank, the larger the penalty. This is similar to the famous BHq procedure [Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a family to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. SLOPE is a convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the solution. We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking lambda_i = F^{-1}(1-q_i) (F is the cdf of the errors), q_i = iq/(2p), controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. When the design matrix is nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the power which can be obtained with model selection methods based on L1-like penalties. However, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated, we demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters lambda_i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number of nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure exhibits increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally. The paper illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule through comprehensive simulation studies.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""34616072""); list(name = ""Ewout van den Berg"", ids = ""3258079""); list(name = ""Weijie J.

798e69c851addfed88c47220bbe00690953e2016,Antibodies to Multiple Receptors are Associated with Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Mortality in Alzheimer's Disease: A Longitudinal Study.,"BACKGROUND
Endogenous antibodies to signaling molecules and receptors (Abs) are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the association of 33 Abs to dopaminergic, serotoninergic, muscarinic, adrenergic, vascular, and immune receptors with cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and mortality outcomes.


METHODS
Ninety-one patients with mild AD were followed annually for 5 years with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; composite outcomes: ""psychosis"" (item 1 + 2), ""mood"" (item 4 + 5 + 7), and ""agitation"" (item 3 + 8 + 9)). Abs were quantified in sera obtained at baseline by ELISA and reduced to principal components (PCs). Associations between Abs and outcomes were assessed by a mixed model (MMSE decline), zero-inflated fixed effects count models (composite NPI scores), and Cox regression (mortality). The resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing according to a false discovery rate of 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg).


RESULTS
The measured levels of the 33 Abs formed four PCs. PC1 (dopaminergic and serotonergic Abs) was associated with increased mortality (Hazard ratio 2.57, p < 0.001), PC2 (serotonergic, immune, and vascular Abs) with decreased agitation symptoms (Î² - 0.19, p < 0.001), and PC3 (cholinergic receptor Abs) with increased mood symptoms (Î² 0.04, p = 0.002), over time. There were no associations between Abs and MMSE decline.


CONCLUSION
The associations between Abs, mortality, and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported in this cohort are intriguing. They cannot, however, be generalized. Validation in independent sample sets is required.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lasse Melvaer Giil"", ids = ""14743332""); list(name = ""Dag Aarsland"", ids = ""8558876""); list(name = ""Kristoffer H Hellton"", ids = ""6076423""); list(name = ""Anders Lund"", ids = ""40123178""); list(name = ""Harald Heidecke"", ids = ""4651937""); list(name = ""Kai Schulze-Forster"", ids = ""1439824838""); list(name = ""Gabriela Riemekasten"", ids = ""4531476""); list(name = ""Audun Osland Vik-Mo"", ids = ""1401915511""); list(name = ""Einar KlÃ¦boe Kristoffersen"", ids = ""3139910""); list(name = ""Christian A Vedeler"", ids = ""143818064""); list(name = ""Jan Erik Nordrehaug"", ids = ""5655933"")",7e5ed4a7c6ac294b22c7442c10fe78f93e98de04,,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,64 3,"

6abd1f0d99bef9611e00442339b484a2ef20852e,211 in Vitro Culture Conditions Affect Gene Expression Pattern of Bovine Blastocyst in a Stage-specific Manner,"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of in vitro culture conditions at specific phases of early embryonic development on the transcriptome profile of bovine blastocysts. Simmental heifers were superovulated and artificially inseminated 2 times with the same frozenâ€“thawed commercial bull semen. Using nonsurgical endoscopic oviductal flushing technology (Besenfelder et al. 2001 Theriogenology 55, 837â€“845), 6 different blastocyst groups were flushed out at different time points (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-cell and morula). After flushing, embryos cultured under in vitro conditions until the blastocyst stage. Blastocysts from each group were collected and pooled in groups of 10. Complete in vivo blastocysts were produced and used as control. A unique custom microarray (Agilent) containing 42â€‰242 oligo probes (60-mers) was used over 6 replicates of each group v. the in vivo control group to examine the transcriptome profile of blastocysts. A clear difference in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG, fold change â‰¥2, false discovery rate â‰¤0.05) has been found between groups flushed out at 2-, 4-, and 8-cell (1714, 1918, 1292 DEG, respectively) and those flushed out at 16-, 32-cell and morula stages and cultured in vitro until blastocyst stage (311, 437, 773 DEG, respectively) compared with the complete vivo group. Ontological classification of DEG showed cell death to be the most significant function in all groups. However, the longer time embryos spent under in vitro conditions, the more the percentage of DEG involved in cell death and apoptosis processes are represented in those groups. In addition, genes related to post-translational modification and gene expression processes were significantly dysregulated in all groups. Pathway analysis revealed that protein ubiquitination pathway was the dominant pathway in the groups flushed out at 2-, 4-, and 8-cells but not in the other groups flushed at later stages compared with the in vivo control group. Moreover, retinoic acid receptor activation and apoptosis signalling pathways followed the same pattern. Embryos flushed out before the time of embryonic genome activation and subsequently cultured in vitro were highly affected by culture conditions. Overall, the results of the present study showed that despite the fact that embryos originated from the same source, in vitro culture condition affected embryo quality, measured in terms of gene expression, in a stage-specific manner.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Ahmed Gad"", ids = ""2832417""); list(name = ""Urban Besenfelder"", ids = ""6623068""); list(name = ""Vita Havlicek"", ids = ""46519985""); list(name = ""Michael Hoelker"", ids = ""3751413""); list(name = ""Mehmet UlaÅŸ Ã‡inar"", ids = ""1986682""); list(name = ""Franka Rings"", ids = ""13344250""); list(name = ""Isabelle Dufort"", ids = ""4665276""); list(name = ""M.

PtGen2, a 26,496 feature cDNA microarray, was fabricated and used to assess drought-induced gene expression in loblolly pine propagule roots. Statistical analysis of differential expression and weighted gene correlation network analysis were used to identify drought-responsive genes and further characterize the molecular basis of drought tolerance in loblolly pine.ResultsMicroarrays were used to interrogate root cDNA populations obtained from 12 genotype Ã— treatment combinations (four genotypes, three watering regimes). Comparison of drought-stressed roots with roots from the control treatment identified 2445 genes displaying at least a 1.5-fold expression difference (false discovery rate = 0.01). Genes commonly associated with drought response in pine and other plant species, as well as a number of abiotic and biotic stress-related genes, were up-regulated in drought-stressed roots. Only 76 genes were identified as differentially expressed in drought-recovered roots, indicating that the transcript population can return to the pre-drought state within 48 hours. Gene correlation analysis predicts a scale-free network topology and identifies eleven co-expression modules that ranged in size from 34 to 938 members. Network topological parameters identified a number of central nodes (hubs) including those with significant homology (E-values â‰¤ 2 Ã— 10-30) to 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, zeatin O-glucosyltransferase, and ABA-responsive protein. Identified hubs also include genes that have been associated previously with osmotic stress, phytohormones, enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species, and several genes of unknown function.ConclusionPtGen2 was used to evaluate transcriptome responses in loblolly pine and was leveraged to identify 2445 differentially expressed genes responding to severe drought stress in roots. Many of the genes identified are known to be up-regulated in response to osmotic stress in pine and other plant species and encode proteins involved in both signal transduction and stress tolerance. Gene expression levels returned to control values within a 48-hour recovery period in all but 76 transcripts. Correlation network analysis indicates a scale-free network topology for the pine root transcriptome and identifies central nodes that may serve as drivers of drought-responsive transcriptome dynamics in the roots of loblolly pine.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""W.

bce06c1cfc592dc9db5fa8d294d13df0d5db1e00,Finding significantly connected voxels based on histograms of connection strengths,"We explore a new approach for structural connectivity based segmentations of subcortical brain regions. Connectivity based segmentations are usually based on fibre connections from a seed region to predefined target regions. We present a method for finding significantly connected voxels based on the distribution of connection strengths. Paths from seed voxels to all voxels in a target region are obtained from a shortest-path tractography. For each seed voxel we approximate the distribution with a histogram of path scores. We hypothesise that the majority of estimated connections are false-positives and that their connection strength is distributed differently from true-positive connections. Therefore, an empirical null-distribution is defined for each target region as the average normalized histogram over all voxels in the seed region. Single histograms are then tested against the corresponding null-distribution and significance is determined using the false discovery rate (FDR). Segmentations are based on significantly connected voxels and their FDR. In this work we focus on the thalamus and the target regions were chosen by dividing the cortex into a prefrontal/temporal zone, motor zone, somatosensory zone and a parieto-occipital zone. The obtained segmentations consistently show a sparse number of significantly connected voxels that are located near the surface of the anterior thalamus over a population of 38 subjects.",2016,Engineering; Physics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Niklas Kasenburg"", ids = ""2423123""); list(name = ""Morten Vester Pedersen"", ids = ""122191338""); list(name = ""Sune Darkner"", ids = ""1762901"")",b17f7c96d4362cf35b9c50f97e0cadf3ac4b2ed6,6c3c1419cb6aedf28ec9608c0a1f169e7fe7ee03; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 328b421c7107bf8f2c79010441f57d18c2706c60; 8ece878bb0f2a4cfebb7c9996f29aa5aa3a0bf01; 7d5aedecdfc4e8f83638bac47eb7cf2f860ec51c; 8022c53a102d417f4fe2e7cd6cd330cca3e40352; a89d23db5695b754bf735ce7c4a9c538aca0760e; 9e6695eb07d664e5722ade04a169b96d2f15cefb; ab8088f2f17208c6f289e07a9df0041184061ccb; 7072ef929fa3d7c3177ca868309523c588a67bd1; fc6218567d7ded9e99d172fbd721d15c82a51f2e; 19cb15233d74888ad633a31c46b5fb4d472756df; 34b80a764bdf9a8112105df714176507a5f95da5; 09a08c65b3b0f2cd7fb0d3c72e6562b87179865a; b18ddb0b6b7518526bce6450cea66af5fde4d37e; 67b5a943caf085a5079a9a34cd30204a2a4c4fd6; 18cfee92095c476376b798736f0a038838d833af,,9784,
ac8987c211f2c891c9eba5e5c2d60ddfbd9d8d9d,Maternal fatty acid concentrations and newborn DNA methylation.,"BACKGROUND
Preconception nutrition sets the stage for a healthy pregnancy. Maternal fatty acids (FAs) are related to beneficial neonatal outcomes with DNA methylation proposed as a mechanism; however, few studies have investigated this association and none with preconception FAs.


OBJECTIVES
We examined the relations of maternal plasma FA concentrations at preconception (nÂ =Â 346) and 8 weeks of gestation (nÂ =Â 374) with newborn DNA methylation.


METHODS
The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction Trial (2006-2012) randomly assigned women with previous pregnancy loss to low dose aspirin or placebo prior to conception. We measured maternal plasma phospholipid FA concentration at preconception (on average 4 mo before pregnancy) and 8 weeks of gestation. Cord blood DNA from singletons was measured using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We used robust linear regression to test the associations of FA concentration with methylation Î²-values of each CpG site, adjusting for estimated cell count using a cord blood reference, sample plate, maternal sociodemographic characteristics, cholesterol, infant sex, and epigenetic-derived ancestry. False discovery rate correction was used for multiple testing.


RESULTS
Mean Â± SD concentrations of preconception marine (20:5n-3+22:6n-3+22:5n-3) and Ï‰-6 PUFAs, SFAs, MUFAs, and trans FAs were 4.7 Â± 1.2, 38.0 Â± 2.0, 39.4 Â± 1.8, 11.6 Â± 1.1, and 1.0 Â± 0.4 % of total FA, respectively; concentrations at 8 weeks of gestation were similar. Preconception marine PUFA concentration was associated with higher methylation at GRAMD2 (PÂ =Â 1.1Â Ã—Â 10-8), LOXL1 (PÂ =Â 5.5Â Ã—Â 10-8), SIK3 (PÂ =Â 1.6Â Ã—Â 10-7), HTR1B (PÂ =Â 1.9Â Ã—Â 10-7), and MCC (PÂ =Â 2.1Â Ã—Â 10-7) genes. Preconception SFA concentration was associated with higher methylation at KIF25-AS1 and lower methylation at SLC39A14; other associations exhibited sensitivity to outliers. The trans FA concentration was related to lower methylation at 3 sites and higher methylation at 1 site. FAs at 8 weeks of gestation were largely unrelated to DNA methylation.


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal preconception FAs are related to newborn DNA methylation of specific CpG sites, highlighting the importance of examining nutritional exposures preconceptionally.

042767bd4c86998fc1f8b45760fec4ee52943ff1,Comparative Proteomic Study of Mouse Liver Exposed to Differing Gravitational Environments.,"It has been shown that long term exposure to altered gravitational environments leads to altered intermediary metabolism with a concomitant reduction in body adiposity. This effect on liver protein expression has been poorly examined. Using gel/c MS/MS on extracted liver proteins we will compare protein profiles from mice flown in space compared to control mice maintained at earth's gravity on the ground. Livers were obtained from mice that were exposed for 90 days to three different living conditions; zero gravity on the international space station; housing similar to spaceflight in a ground laboratory and mice housed in standard vivarium cages in a ground laboratory. Liver proteins were extracted, run on a 1-D gel, and trypsin digested. Extracts were analyzed by LC MS/MS. Proteins were searched and validated with X! tandem and Scaffold Software. Spectral counts were compared using ANOVA to determine significant differences in expression. Roughly 4,000 proteins with a 7.7% Protein and 0.1% peptide false discovery rate were identified, from nine gel lanes. On average more proteins were identified from the liver samples of zero gravity mice (3439 average) than were identified in the lab (3241 average) and vivarium conditions (3157 average). Whether this difference represents an uptick in expression due to altered gravitational conditions, or sample preparation and LC MS/MS variability is yet to be determined. ANOVA showed approximately 500 proteins with a p value of <0.05. Many proteins were only found in the space treated mouse liver including Gly domain-containing linker protein and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase with p values of (0.00000085) and (0.0000095) respectively. Proteins that show statistically significant differences between conditions will be monitored by Single Ion Monitoring targeted mass spectrometry for verification.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Brett S Phinney"", ids = ""3885438""); list(name = ""Darren J.

ca524391d0ac52c37537e031523977718d27b323,Dynamic transcriptomic profiles of zebrafish gills in response to zinc supplementation,"BackgroundDietary zinc supplementation may help to promote growth, boost the immune system, protect against diabetes, and aid recovery from diarrhoea. We exploited the zebrafish (Danio rerio) gill as a unique vertebrate ion transporting epithelium model to study the time-dependent regulatory networks of gene-expression leading to homeostatic control during zinc supplementation. This organ forms a conduit for zinc uptake whilst exhibiting conservation of zinc trafficking components.ResultsFish were maintained with either zinc supplemented water (4.0 Î¼M) and diet (2023 mg zinc kg-1) or water and diet containing Zn2+ at 0.25 Î¼M and 233 mg zinc kg-1, respectively. Gill tissues were harvested at five time points (8 hours to 14 days) and transcriptome changes analysed in quintuplicate using a 16 K microarray with results anchored to gill Zn2+ influx and whole body nutrient composition (protein, carbohydrate, lipid, elements). The number of regulated genes increased up to day 7 but declined as the fish acclimated. In total 525 genes were regulated (having a fold-change more than 1.8 fold change and an adjusted P-value less than 0.1 which is controlling a 10% False discovery rate, FDR) by zinc supplementation, but little overlap was observed between genes regulated at successive time-points. Many genes displayed cyclic expression, typical for homeostatic control mechanisms. Annotation enrichment analysis revealed strong overrepresentation of ""transcription factors"", with specific association evident with ""steroid hormone receptors"". A suite of genes linked to ""development"" were also statistically overrepresented. More specifically, early regulation of genes was linked to a few key transcription factors (e.g. Mtf1, Jun, Stat1, Ppara, Gata3) and was followed by hedgehog and bone morphogenic protein signalling.ConclusionsThe results suggest that zinc supplementation reactivated developmental pathways in the gill and stimulated stem cell differentiation, a response likely reflecting gill remodelling in response to its altered environment. This provides insight to the role of zinc during cell differentiation and illustrates the critical nature of maintaining zinc status.

Design: Functional imaging study comparing movement mirroring with movement observation in both hands in an otherwise identical setting. Imaging data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping software with significance threshold set at p<0.01 (false discovery rate) and a minimum cluster size of 20 voxels. Setting: MRI department. Participants: A total of 15 right-handed healthy subjects age range 22-56 years. Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Cerebral activation during movement mirroring and movement observation. Level of Evidence: level 1. Results: Movement mirroring induced additional activation in primary and higher-order visual areas strictly contralateral to the limb seen by the subject. There was no significant difference of brain activity when comparing movement observation of somebody elseâ€™s right hand with left hand. Conclusion: Lateralized cerebral activations are elicited by inversion of visual feedback (movement mirroring) but not by movement observation.,2014,Psychology,"list(name = ""Jing Wang"", ids = ""49605754""); list(name = ""Dohle Christian"", ids = ""83414329""); list(name = ""Mauritz Karl Heinze"", ids = ""116544505""); list(name = ""F.

63e5cffe629e7fd22a2bf01de505f92ab1e4ca4c,Simultaneous control of false positives and false negatives in multiple hypotheses testing,"Multiple hypotheses testing is concerned with appropriately controlling the rate of false positives, false negatives or both when testing several hypotheses simultaneously. Nowadays, the common approach to testing multiple hypotheses calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses referred to as the false discovery rate (FDR) or suitable measures based on the positive false discovery rate (pFDR). In this paper, we consider the problem of determining levels that both false positives and false negatives can be controlled simultaneously. As our risk function, we use the expected value of the maximum between the proportions of false positives and false negatives, with the expectation being taken conditional on the event that at least one hypothesis is rejected and one is accepted, referred to as hybrid error rate (HER). We then develop, based on HER, an analog of p-value termed as h-value to test the individual hypotheses. The use of the new procedure is illustrated using the well-known public data set by Golub et al.

713e285b485345b478ed2af5181ff7288b3c3cd1,Comparing alternative pipelines for cross-platform microarray gene expression data integration with RNA-seq data in breast cancer,"Background According to major public repositories statistics an overwhelming majority of the existing and newly uploaded data originates from microarray experiments. Unfortunately, the potential of this data to bring new insights is limited by the effects of individual study-specific biases due to small number of biological samples. Increasing sample size by direct microarray data integration increases the statistical power to obtain a more precise estimate of gene expression in a population of individuals resulting in lower false discovery rates. However, despite numerous recommendations for gene expression data integration, there is a lack of a systematic comparison of different processing approaches aimed to asses microarray platforms diversity and ambiguous probesets to genes correspondence, leading to low number of studies applying integration. Results Here, we investigated five different approaches of the microarrays data processing in comparison with RNA-seq data on breast cancer samples. We aimed to evaluate different probesets annotations as well as different procedures of choosing between probesets mapped to the same gene. We show that pipelines rankings are mostly preserved across Affymetrix and Illumina platforms. BrainArray approach based on updated annotation and redesigned probesets definition and choosing probeset with the maximum average signal across the samples have best correlation with RNA-seq, while averaging probesets signals as well as scoring the quality of probes sequences mapping to the transcripts of the targeted gene have worse correlation. Finally, randomly selecting probeset among probesets mapped to the same gene significantly decreases the correlation with RNA-seq. Conclusion We show that methods, which rely on actual probesets signal intensities, are advantageous to methods considering biological characteristics of the probes sequences only and that cross-platform integration of datasets improves correlation with the RNA-seq data.

The genetic causes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are not fully understood.


OBJECTIVE
To identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DVT.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS
We used 3 case-control studies of first DVT. A total of 19 682 gene-centric SNPs were genotyped in 443 cases and 453 controls from the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS, 1988-1992). Twelve hundred six SNPs associated with DVT were reinvestigated in the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis study (MEGA-1, 1999-2004) in a subset of 1398 cases and 1757 controls. Nine SNPs associated with DVT in both LETS and MEGA-1 were investigated a third time in 1314 cases and 2877 controls from MEGA-2, a second subset of MEGA. Additional SNPs close to one SNP in CYP4V2 were genotyped in LETS and MEGA-1.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Odds ratios (ORs) for DVT were estimated by logistic regression. False discovery rates served to investigate the effect of multiple hypothesis testing.


RESULTS
Of 9 SNPs genotyped in MEGA-2, 3 were strongly associated with DVT (P < .05; false discovery rate < or =.10): rs13146272 in CYP4V2 (risk allele frequency, 0.64), rs2227589 in SERPINC1 (risk allele frequency, 0.10), and rs1613662 in GP6 (risk allele frequency, 0.84). The OR for DVT per risk allele was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.11-1.37) for rs13146272, 1.29 (95% CI, 1.10-1.49) for rs2227589, and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.01-1.30) for rs1613662. In the region of CYP4V2, we identified 4 additional SNPs (in CYP4V2, KLKB1, and F11) that were also associated with both DVT (highest OR per risk allele, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.11-1.74) and coagulation factor XI level (highest increase per risk allele, 8%; 95% CI, 5%-11%).


CONCLUSIONS
We identified SNPs in several genes that were associated with DVT. We also found SNPs in the region around the SNP in CYP4V2 (rs13146272) that were associated with both DVT and factor XI levels. These results show that common genetic variation plays an important role in determining thrombotic risk.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Irene D Bezemer"", ids = ""5510890""); list(name = ""Lance A.

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Dear Editors: We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the statistical treatment of our data. During the preparation of the manuscript, we did consider the use of the t-test as proposed by Dr. Buyske. Indeed, the z-test requires that the standard deviation be known, while we estimated the standard deviation from the sample. However, the t-test is not ideal either. A t-test compares two groups of values and the statistics rely on the standard deviation of both groups. It is unconventional to use the t-test to compare a single value, i.e., that of the miRNA in each case of autism against a group of values. By definition, the single values do not K. Abu-Elneel : T.

Gazzaniga Biomedical Sciences, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA have a standard deviation. For this reason, we chose the z- test as a first-level less stringent screen to assess differential expression between one autistic case and 13 normal cases for each miRNA. We had also addressed the issue raised by Dr. Buyske with a nonparametric approachâ€”the Wilcoxon rank test. However, the statistical power of the rank order test is rather weak and, more importantly, we lose the information in the differences in magnitude of the miRNAs. A strength of the method we used to profile the miRNAsâ€”real-time PCRâ€”is its ability to detect a broad dynamic range of miRNA expression. Our method was preferable to capture this quantitative parameter. However, the miRNAs with p- values that rank among the top using the parametric test remain among the top with the nonparametric test. The statistical testing as suggested by Dr. Buyske does demonstrate some differentially expressed miRNAs. With a one-sided t-test, our top five miRNAs remained statistically significant. The main difference between the z-test and t- test in a sense is the p-value cutoff. The z-test is indeed less stringent than the t-test and the two-sided t-test further increases the stringency. On the other hand, the Bonferroni correction for multiple hypotheses testing, applied in the manuscript, is often considered overly stringent. If we control for multiple hypotheses with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) rather than the Bonferroni correction on t- statistics, the number of dysregulated miRNAs goes from five to 13. One could further argue that even the FDR is overly stringent because many miRNAs are co-regulated, and therefore treating each as an independent query may be unnecessarily conservative. Whichever the test and correction, we did provide all p- values signifying the difference between each autistic case and the normal cases for each miRNA, and these p-values are not affected by the significance cutoff.

One important paradigm towards this has been providing algorithms for adversarially learning fair classifiers (Zhang et al., 2018; Madras et al., 2018). We formulate the adversarial learning problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and find the fair model using gradient descent-ascent algorithm with a modified gradient update step, inspired by the approach of Zhang et al., 2018. We provide theoretical insight and guarantees that formalize the heuristic arguments presented previously towards taking such an approach. We test our approach empirically on the Adult dataset and synthetic datasets and compare against state of the art algorithms (Celis et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Zafar et al., 2017). The results show that our models and algorithms have comparable or better accuracy than other algorithms while performing better in terms of fairness, as measured using statistical rate or false discovery rate.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""L.

6890c5dd7031c9d8b6153220088a94b8e31c2a01,The Prognostic Significance of Low-Frequency Somatic Mutations in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma,"Background: Little is known about the prognostic significance of somatically mutated genes in metastatic melanoma (MM). We have employed a combined clinical and bioinformatics approach on tumor samples from cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) to identify mutated genes with potential clinical relevance. Methods: After limiting our DNA sequencing analysis to MM samples (n = 356) and to the CANCER CENSUS gene list, we filtered out mutations with low functional significance (snpEFF). We performed Cox analysis on 53 genes that were mutated in â‰¥3% of samples, and had â‰¥50% difference in incidence of mutations in deceased subjects versus alive subjects. Results: Four genes were potentially prognostic [RAC1, FGFR1, CARD11, CIITA; false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2]. We identified 18 additional genes (e.g., SPEN, PDGFRB, GNAS, MAP2K1, EGFR, TSC2) that were less likely to have prognostic value (FDR < 0.4). Most somatic mutations in these 22 genes were infrequent (< 10%), associated with high somatic mutation burden, and were evenly distributed across all exons, except for RAC1 and MAP2K1. Mutations in only 9 of these 22 genes were also identified by RNA sequencing in >75% of the samples that exhibited corresponding DNA mutations. The low frequency, UV signature type and RNA expression of the 22 genes in MM samples were confirmed in a separate multi-institution validation cohort (n = 413). An underpowered analysis within a subset of this validation cohort with available patient follow-up (n = 224) showed that somatic mutations in SPEN and RAC1 reached borderline prognostic significance [log-rank favorable (p = 0.09) and adverse (p = 0.07), respectively]. Somatic mutations in SPEN, and to a lesser extent RAC1, were not associated with definite gene copy number or RNA expression alterations. High (>2+) nuclear plus cytoplasmic expression intensity for SPEN was associated with longer melanoma-specific overall survival (OS) compared to lower (â‰¤ 2+) nuclear intensity (p = 0.048). We conclude that expressed somatic mutations in infrequently mutated genes beyond the well-characterized ones (e.g., BRAF, RAS, CDKN2A, PTEN, TP53), such as RAC1 and SPEN, may have prognostic significance in MM.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaobei Zhao"", ids = ""51082053""); list(name = ""Paul Little"", ids = ""144804471""); list(name = ""Alan P.

6ebd4554c9a214de970a7f95bf33cbcb7ba68d3d,PepC: proteomics software for identifying differentially expressed proteins based on spectral counting,"UNLABELLED
Identifying biologically significant changes in protein abundance between two conditions is a key issue when analyzing proteomic data. One widely used approach centers on spectral counting, a label-free method that sums all the tandem mass spectra for a protein observed in an analysis. To assess the significance of the results, we recently combined the t-test and G-test, with random permutation analysis, and we validated this approach biochemically. To automate the statistical method, we developed PepC, a software program that balances the trade-off between the number of differentially expressed proteins identified and the false discovery rate. This tool can be applied to a wide range of proteomic datasets, making data analysis rapid, reproducible and easily interpretable by proteomics specialists and non-specialists alike.

1606ba8d8af181d21705130b2f1913557894e719,Identifying differentially expressed proteins in two-dimensional electrophoresis experiments: inputs from transcriptomics statistical tools,"BACKGROUND
Two-dimensional electrophoresis is a crucial method in proteomics that allows the characterization of proteins' function and expression. This usually implies the identification of proteins that are differentially expressed between two contrasting conditions, for example, healthy versus diseased in human proteomics biomarker discovery and stressful conditions versus control in animal experimentation. The statistical procedures that lead to such identifications are critical steps in the 2-DE analysis workflow. They include a normalization step and a test and probability correction for multiple testing. Statistical issues caused by the high dimensionality of the data and large-scale multiple testing have been a more active topic in transcriptomics than proteomics, especially in microarray analysis. We thus propose to adapt innovative statistical tools developed for microarray analysis and incorporate them in the 2-DE analysis pipeline.


RESULTS
In this article, we evaluate the performance of different normalization procedures, different statistical tests and false discovery rate calculation methods with both real and simulated datasets. We demonstrate that the use of statistical procedures adapted from microarrays lead to notable increase in power as well as a minimization of false-positive discovery rate. More specifically, we obtained the best results in terms of reliability and sensibility when using the 'moderate t-test' from Smyth in association with classic false discovery rate from Benjamini and Hochberg.

The ER positive cohort was subsequently divided into Luminal A, Luminal B HER2 negative and Luminal B HER2 positive subtypes. Core- needle biopsies were collected from 78 female patients with inoperable locally advanced breast cancer or resectable tumors suitable for downstaging, before any treatment. Expressions of 23 genes were determined by means of TagMan Low Density Arrays. Analysis of variance was used to select genes with discriminatory potential between receptor subtypes. We introduced a correction for false discovery rates (presented as q values) due to testing multiple hypothesis. Pairwise post-hoc comparisons of receptor subtypes were performed using Tukey 's HSD test. Five genes out of a 23-gene microarray differed significantly in relation to breast cancer receptor-based subtypes. Among these five genes, we identified: BCL2 (p=0.0002, q=0.0009), MKI67 (p=0.0037, q=0.0064), IGF1R (p=0.0040, q=0.0064), FOXC1 (p=0.0113, q=0.0135) and IRF1 (p=0.0435, q=0.0416) as ones showing ER positive, HER2 positive and triple negative -subtype specific expression profiles. When incorporating Luminal A, Luminal B HER2 negative, Luminal B HER2 positive subtypes into analysis, four genes: BCL2 (p=0.0006, q=0.0034), MKI67 (p=0.0078, q=0.0198), FOXC1 (p=0.0102, q=0.0198) and IGF1R (p=0.0174, q=0.0254) were selected.

40a4f5365f2bad9e4fc9dc39a2355ee71c02cf64,1728. A Retrospective Analysis of 49 Cases of Histoplasmosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients on Tumor Necrosis Factor-Î± Antagonists,"Background. We developed and validated a mouse model of C. albicans IAC that mimics peritonitis and abscesses (IAA) in humans, and that is amenable to temporalâ€“ spatial transcriptional profiling and virulence studies. Methods. We measured C. albicans SC5314 gene expression by RNA-Seq (RiboPure extraction; Illumina MiSeq) in triplicate during early peritonitis (within 30 minutes of infection), late peritonitis (24 hours) and IAA (48 hours). Differential expression was defined by â‰¥2-fold differences at false discovery rate â‰¤0.01. Results. â‰¥7 million C. albicans reads were detected in each experiment. 67% of C. albicans reads mapped to coding sequences, covering 93% of open reading frames. The 50 C. albicans genes most highly expressed during early peritonitis were associated with pH (including RIM101 and PHR1) and oxidative stress responses, and adhesion/ hyphal growth (e.g., ALS3, HWP1, ECM331, SAP6). The corresponding 50 C. albicans late peritonitis genes were associated with neutrophil/macrophage responses and nutrient acquisition (glyoxylate cycle, fatty acid Î²-oxidation, iron homeostasis). Responses within IAA included DNA damage and iron metabolism, reflecting stress response and nutrient/metal limitation. The top 50 core gene responses for all stages were associated with adhesion, stress response, and glucose transport. Among the most up-regulated genes in late peritonitis and IAA compared with early peritonitis were those involved antifungal drug resistance (CDR family, MDR1, FLU1, and ERG family), although mice were not exposed to antifungals. Null and reconstitution mutants for genes involved in adhesion (ALS3), copper transport (CCC2), DNA (DDI1) and cell wall damage responses (DAP1 homologs), and glycerol biosynthesis (RHR2) were attenuated for virulence in temporal-spatial fashion during peritonitis and IAA, and/or hyper-susceptible to phagocytosis and echinocandins (table). Conclusion. C. albicans relies upon diverse biologic processes to cause peritonitis and IAA. Multiple genes induced in response to stress during IAC mediate virulence, phagocyte, and echinocandin resistance. Therefore, pathogenic strategies used by C. albicans during IAC may lessen responses to echinocandin treatment, even in the absence of drug exposure or FKS mutations.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Courtney K.

We systematically identified HIV-1 risk factors in two nationally representative cohorts of women in the Demographic and Health Surveys. Methods: We identified and replicated the association of 1415 social, economic, environmental, and behavioral factors with HIV-1 status. We used the 2007 and 2013â€“2014 surveys conducted among 5715 and 15â€Š433 Zambian women, respectively (688 shared factors). We used false discovery rate criteria to identify factors that are strongly associated with HIV-1 in univariate and multivariate models of the entire population, as well as in subgroups stratified by wealth, residence, age, and past HIV-1 testing. Results: In the univariate analysis, we identified 102 and 182 variables that are associated with HIV-1 in the two surveys, respectively (79 factors were associated in both). Factors that were associated with HIV-1 status in full-sample analyses and in subgroups include being formerly married (adjusted OR 2007, 2.8, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’16; 2013â€“2014 2.8, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’29), widowhood (aOR 3.7, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’12; and 4.2, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’30), genital ulcers within 12 months (aOR 2.4, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’5; and 2.2, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’6), and having a woman head of the household (aOR 1.7, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’7; and 2.1, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’26), while owning a bicycle (aOR 0.6, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’6; and 0.6, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’8) and currently breastfeeding (aOR 0.5, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’9; and 0.4, Pâ€Š<â€Š10âˆ’26) were associated with decreased risk. Area under the curve for HIV-1 positivity was 0.76â€“0.82.

Two procedures are proposed based on weighted p-values, where the weights for p-values are obtained by maximizing a power-related objective function. We find that the proposed procedures can control the false discovery rate asymptotically, and are more powerful than existing methods asymptotically. We further examine their performances with extensive simulations. For illustration, we apply the proposed methods to the adequate yearly progress data.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Haibing Zhao"", ids = ""37950585""); list(name = ""Jiajia Zhang"", ids = ""49050970"")",35aaa29d5bac7d9bd55be0a955d180422b6a9c33; fd4de5e69b3942e3ff28ed06f1722b0e17d5fadf; 4d442f793573153f93e2901617b97ca90098be5a; c117971e646e96ba2577f8a7f39246f021e08544,,Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,151,90-106

The 478 fish had EBV for this trait and genotypes for 3,318 SNP. The analysis took into account pedigree relationships among individuals to avoid spurious associations due to population structure. False positives arising from the large number of markers tested were controlled through decision thresholds. SNP with P < 0.001 and chromosome-wise false discovery rate < 10% were accepted. This identified 3 SNP on Ssa10 and one on Ssa21, which may be linked to QTL. The data seemed insufficient to warrant proceeding with a validation of the results.

Methods: The expression profiles of lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA in gastric cancer and paracancer tissues were analyzed by biochip technology, edgeR package in R software was used to filtrate differential expression genes (multiple change of >1.5 times, P<0.05) and volcano map was drawn. Based on the online miRNA-lncRNA prediction tool lncBase database and the miRNA Target gene prediction database (miRTarBase, target-scan, miRDB, starBase), the relationship between miRNA, lncRNA and mRNA was predicted. Cytoscape software was used to construct lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network and key genes (hub genes) were identified based on cytohubba calculation of degree score of each node. Then Hub genes related to the prognosis of gastric cancer were verified in the TCGA database. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNA was performed using the online biological information annotation database DAVID, P<0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 were used as cut-off criteria. R software was used to download the RNA sequencing data and mirna-seq data of gastric cancer and adjacent tissues in TCGA database, edgeR package was used to screen out differentially expressed mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA, and some differentially expressed genes in our data were verified. In OncoLnc database, STAD project of TCGA data was selected and hub gene was input. Patients were divided into two groups based on the median value for hub genes and Kaplan-meier analysis was performed. Results: The differentially expressed 766 mRNA, 110 lncRNA and 10 miRNA were screened out, among them 90 mRNA, 4 lncRNA and 6 miRNA were used to construct the ceRNA network, and 2 of the 20 hub genes were related to the prognosis of patients. MLK7-AS1, SPP1, SULF1, hsa-miR-1307-3p were upregulated in gastric cancer tissues from our biochip, while MT2A, MT1X were downregulated, which were consistent with the results of TCGA gastric cancer database. The differentially expressed mRNAs were significantly enriched in the biological process (BP) and the mineral absorption pathway. CHST1 was negatively correlated while miR-183-5p was positively corelated with the survival of patients.

Topiramate (TPM) is suggested to be a promising medication for treatment of methamphetamine (METH) dependence, but the molecular basis remains to be elucidated.


Methods
Among 140 METH-dependent participants randomly assigned to receive either TPM (Nâ€‰=â€‰69) or placebo (Nâ€‰=â€‰71) in a previously conducted randomized controlled trial, 50 TPM- and 49 placebo-treated participants had a total 212 RNA samples available at baseline, week 8, and week 12 time points. Following our primary analysis of gene expression data, we reanalyzed the microarray expression data based on a latent class analysis of binary secondary outcomes during weeks 1-12 that provided a classification of 21 responders and 31 non-responders with consistent responses at both time points.


Results
Based on secondary outcomes, 1,381, 576, 905, and 711 differentially expressed genes at nominal P valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.05 were identified in responders versus non-responders for week 8 TPM, week 8 placebo, week 12 TPM, and week 12 placebo groups, respectively. Among 1,381 genes identified in week 8 TPM responders, 359 genes were identified in both week 8 and week 12 TPM groups, of which 300 genes were exclusively detected in TPM responders. Of them, 32 genes had nominal P valuesâ€‰<â€‰5â€‰Ã—â€‰10-3 at either week 8 or week 12 and false discovery ratesâ€‰<â€‰0.15 at both time points with consistent directions of gene expression changes, which include GABARAPL1, GPR155, and IL15RA in GABA receptor signaling that represent direct targets for TPM. Analyses of these 300 genes revealed 7 enriched pathways belonging to neuronal function/synaptic plasticity, signal transduction, inflammation/immune function, and oxidative stress response categories. No pathways were enriched for 72 genes exclusively detected in both week 8 and week 12 placebo groups.

8368c02caabc9ffe6a62e3bb978327b3bcee68cc,Improved classification model for peptide identification based on self-paced learning,"Post-database searching is a key procedure for peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) in protein identification with mass spectrometry-based strategies. Although many machine learning-based approaches have been developed to improve the accuracy of peptide identification, the challenge remains for improvement due to the poor quality of data samples. CRanker has shown its effectiveness and efficiency in terms of the number of identified PSMs compared with benchmark algorithms. However, it has two weaknesses: overfitting and instability on small-sized datasets. In this paper, we incorporate two new strategies into CRanker to tackle its weaknesses. First of all, we modify the CRanker model by using different weight parameters for the learning losses of decoy and target PSMs. Moreover, we employ self-paced learning in training process to help the classifier getting avoid of those incorrect PSMs. Experimental studies show the modified CRanker with new strategies is more stable than the original one and outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the number of identified PSMs at the same false discovery rates (FDRs).",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yongxiang Wang"", ids = ""2572812""); list(name = ""Xijun Liang"", ids = ""145474130""); list(name = ""Zhonghang Xia"", ids = ""2237698""); list(name = ""Xinnan Niu"", ids = ""35903239""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

dfc0166a1abba8d4bd0a595c84b02e882c0f58e4,Biphasic Functional Regulation in Hippocampus of Rat with Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion Induced by Permanent Occlusion of Bilateral Common Carotid Artery,"BACKGROUND
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery (BCCAO) in rats has been commonly used for the study of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Despite the apparent cognitive dysfunction in rats with BCCAO, the molecular markers or pathways involved in the pathological alternation have not been clearly identified.


METHODS
Temporal changes (sham, 21, 35, 45, 55 and 70 days) in gene expression in the hippocampus of rats after BCCAO were measured using time-course microarray analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses were performed to identify the functional involvement of temporally regulated genes in BCCAO.


RESULTS
Two major gene expression patterns were observed in the hippocampus of rats after BCCAO. One pattern, which was composed of 341 early up-regulated genes after the surgical procedure, was dominantly involved in immune-related biological functions (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.01). Another pattern composed of 182 temporally delayed down-regulated genes was involved in sensory perception such as olfactory and cognition functions (FDR<0.01). In addition to the two gene expression patterns, the temporal change of GO and the pathway activities using all differentially expressed genes also confirmed that an immune response was the main early change, whereas sensory functions were delayed responses. Moreover, we identified FADD and SOCS3 as possible core genes in the sensory function loss process using text-based mining and interaction network analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
The biphasic regulatory mechanism first reported here could provide molecular evidence of BCCAO-induced impaired memory in rats as well as mechanism of the development of vascular dementia.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jihye Bang"", ids = ""39782571""); list(name = ""Won Kyung Jeon"", ids = ""40130902""); list(name = ""In Sun Lee"", ids = ""3856156""); list(name = ""Jung-Soo Han"", ids = ""33983721""); list(name = ""Bu-Yeo Kim"", ids = ""90464617"")",ef08fc24b06879ce33ce8b3e1cd400d0852a1324; d84f02d625dd600c7a864afaaad978e162d029cc; e15aa62a61debd4bed0a4cd4d67c0342cdad615a; 2e8a409b2ea795c9145b81c0a67ab48a8913ac9d; 316208a0f2321a28584538398d52e53e5ebc4fbe; b997290f37006b4957510738ad877262f97ce786; 486c5ca099c9e92a923bb476cf03568e5c7adf06; 52f18ce133c2b42c2f94487939d843b8e9ab26bd; f9e4e1c6cf9b749f9360ff60834ee810e7ec8ea6; 0c1dd227abee90d5391236e15d0a3bd288647c30; 622cf3014df6de438ce16d19d98a13a1314a320d; cd660f61c3271b2ffed9d6e60ae4a773c707fd07; f6a29885fc2f307564cd593a181a6613f65b174b; 749f6f71d2d41e4a8a4bb9b92eab3cd676dbe77f; 80e97dac7b9124590b3c617d729d1fe59b5f7e53; 3b44fbba87e7d0a19828b6d05742f72dc8bcf47d; 51e907cae4caa7f0b0070a4dc0401aa03de161a7; 4cb1a02a44c6fb45de8b06d789fb97d7e6b6a178; 70d903d78f493c0e3b85a8610acc61a2725ff5e7; 36e0317b2f9cdc4ecea531d4b953cf736c0b9b8e; 9b55dfec0fa76f3c17f550b3323746303ee51b41; 54c0a246d054c0cb1c38cde5017866216973b55f; 0863eb1bd6b117b57b14bb0b8d16a69f247b96a6,b8a51dda0ecc53958c24e40e0b8c9986a671e67f; 20a9163de9522ea6d93e6597a99339699ad31d3c; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; b65a899e5becfc168ed4211d469d6dc6ccb31a70; 362286ddbdd1e623163433e4ea12d5c16ef91540; 4f02d10a31b5b59fff1ca5dc4cfc040b674b772e; 300cb805debe9eace4c930ee0e63c89980497dd4; 4114d39513b5350b4f143ad720229862faf2987f; f22ec689e5dce260a7f1f42f8d56e246671c2d6f; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; badf5b46ac149a045b42aa836e7e561720672460; 02df87c248a5d65fa191b3ae40595bc6a8a8e56f; 8f8551a038150b6f9a1c784fbe008c363635fea8; c1a07ed4da435c10d684dce08dfb0cd8e81dbf91; 8f62da450f2faa005f442576284b5f3476579423; 3403519d2236076c51da39eeef1411aae70d9617; edc661fb263e72149de955d35504ad813daaa15a; 13e6c240ef6c92fdbfe4b7fc5fca26aa11ec4389; 0d398f79a5496e6e49ddc0a0c8eeaaf881247a82; 6093de7affc6c5d5533af8478ff347a9528047af; 2e65b3e39b0aef8c9c83e96e5f8188ee57bec89e; 0801c9550b7329d84f889f7d392ca13054c12c0f; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 6e806ba4d67238ab5a4b5c8600445b61a43397df; 56b3e658bfe766d6ab39a20835b705318564db16; 828d06933a7299b8ba919d18c64959b21d823e61; 55a58d22cb4d68d135684338afc3323f6ca33b61; 10eb7a495e53745d89a535c2931ed4d7dec97a0e; d73f408984f0053debe5c5f1a5a0001200c8b53e; 44bc2cd1574307d65a0de98b4c730a96b6bb7b95; 249213f697a38df9d7a2e26f7d36baa1f44d62e2; 4135f9658c5e33a5f7bde3f2c72c4c1cd346cebe; ee833b6be1ae5bfbe715e2b8b1d973c60361f4f6; 2b588b189dfc022f5bb4f3c4ac7cd28220a84a2c; 3d5ef1236fba79ea087bde0cab14ebbad861a276; b17c19567b377c4ad01f473f38c11f8b0af3e165,PLoS ONE,8,
fcc74a5729719de8bb2a3cce387d27ef2898c573,Gene expression signatures identify pediatric patients with multiple organ dysfunction who require advanced life support in the intensive care unit,"Background: Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs in the setting of a variety of pathologies including infection and trauma. Some of these patients will further decompensate and require extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a palliating maneuver to allow time for recovery of cardiopulmonary function. The molecular mechanisms driving progression from MODS to cardiopulmonary collapse remain incompletely understood, and no biomarkers have been defined to identify those MODS patients at highest risk for progression to requiring ECMO support. We hypothesize that molecular features derived from whole blood transcriptomic profiling either alone or in combination with traditional clinical and laboratory markers can prospectively identify these high risk MODS patients in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Design/Methods: Whole blood RNA-seq profiling was performed for 23 MODS patients at three time points during their ICU stay (at diagnosis of MODS, 72 hours after, and 8 days later), as well as four healthy controls undergoing routine sedation. Of the 23 MODS patients, six required ECMO support (ECMO patients). The predictive power of conventional demographic and clinical features was quantified for differentiating the MODS and ECMO patients. We then compared the performance of markers derived from transcriptomic profiling including (1) transcriptomically imputed leukocyte subtype distribution, (2) relevant published gene signatures and (3) a novel differential gene expression signature computed from our data set. The predictive power of our novel gene expression signature was then validated using independently published datasets. Results: None of the five demographic characteristics and 14 clinical features, including The Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score, could predict deterioration of MODS to ECMO at baseline. From previously published sepsis signatures, only the signatures positively associated with patients mortality could differentiate ECMO patients from MODS patients, when applied to our transcriptomic dataset (P-value ranges from 0.01 to 0.04). Deconvolution of bulk RNA-Seq samples suggested that lower neutrophil counts were associated with increased risk of progression from MODS to ECMO (P-value = 0.03, OR=2.82 [95% CI 0.63 - 12.45]). A total of 28 genes were differentially expressed between ECMO and MODS patients at baseline (log2 fold change [â‰¥] 1 or [â‰¤] -1 with false discovery rate [â‰¤] 0.2). These genes are involved in protein maintenance and epigenetic-related processes. Further univariate analysis of these 28 genes suggested a signature of six DE genes associated with ECMO (OR > 3.0, P-value [â‰¤] 0.05). Notably, this contains a set of histone marker genes, including H1F0, HIST2H3C, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H4, and HIST1H1B, that were highly expressed in ECMO. A risk score derived from expression of these genes differentiated ECMO and MODS patients in our dataset (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI 0.79-0.1.00, P-value = 7e-04) as well as validation dataset (AUC= 0.73,95% CI 0.53-0.93, P-value = 2e-02). Conclusions: This study identified lower neutrophils and upregulation of specific histone related genes as a putative signature for deterioration of MODS to ECMO. This study demonstrates that transcriptomic features may be superior to traditional clinical methods of ascertaining severity in patients with MODS.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rama Shankar"", ids = ""1562712698""); list(name = ""Mara L.

3b6f86c18c2ac927332200acc56d0691ae2b5afe,Large-Scale Global and Simultaneous Inference: Estimation and Testing in Very High Dimensions,"Due to rapid technological advances, researchers are now able to collect and analyze ever larger data sets. Statistical inference for big data often requires solving thousands or even millions of parallel inference problems simultaneously. This poses significant challenges and calls for new principles, theories, and methodologies. This review provides a selective survey of some recently developed methods and results for large-scale statistical inference, including detection, estimation, and multiple testing. We begin with the global testing problem, where the goal is to detect the existence of sparse signals in a data set, and then move to the problem of estimating the proportion of nonnull effects. Finally, we focus on multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FDR provides a powerful and practical approach to large-scale multiple testing and has been successfully used in a wide range of applications. We discuss several effective data-driven procedures and also present efficient strategies to handle various grouping, hierarchical, and dependency structures in the data.",2017,Economics,"list(name = ""Tengfei Cai"", ids = ""49282956""); list(name = ""Wenguang Sun"", ids = ""49935026"")",b0641f564c0b7a1746d8495b03e931e10f7be705; e8c00d811834c9c4105096edc9749d3738b52363; 9542f16f46fec8f7afef2dc6d7eb8b7d755d7354; cb061c70f48d7fa99879120bfe16676cfa99605c,68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; ee1014390904db3c2c7c1f81719f49450e621a70; f25d4112273f1783260f0301a07fc52300d927af; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 703994d9c0de91777ff741b27c9afa227182a7cf; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; c0af0e87f110d7d8ef4cd7790eaef7364348013f; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; dd63a63ef76d23c898f122f0f757ac307b836c19; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 1086643c453895287174269eb2121491ef270c75; 9c445e726cb8ca9c05312f9642c2129d8396d71b; ea68899db5d44b4d6e28228381ee8016d6b728e6; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 0400bec2d4ae5b265e235627c8a44b8787c7128f; af2a8675a1c160c17d66a0fb2a22a210d6d7eabe; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 1dbfa2053ddb473fcb1558eb2f0358381f277a28; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08; 71151b0961ba4d5958e2eeda524115b5d3757f9d; d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9; 89b9cbb6e2befe6a755a5f70860ce35481da6577; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 8a1e1f340cd16c0b376aaf6629c4bc3dc5650f33; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 8dfeab3c1ba9150c726318b73de2a126b0e0f437; 8fe2ea0a67954f1380b3387e3262f1cdb9f9b3e5; 600d99d9959578a81d611678964b7a4f8cb75730; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; df30e5fef6177bb4ab9527270fdc64ee908858b1; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; a9082bbfcc2b4374f4367d47e14ed76d73cf4d70; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 0b9930266112c8b0684343f741cf83cf2b9a1da2; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; aa9fd7263bb1c65b0ddb4a2a02cec678cd442410; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; b34385fab890190a7937457061929718ef904b69; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 290df9e1297ff98ff6f11747160e1d9693f185bd; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; dfedb34b1da6963b2c635bdae0f6de9ceec064fc,Annual Review of Economics,9,411-439
f2fc23efba96e42cc8edfdb9e6b053a1040d06ea,Adaptive working memory training improved brain function in human immunodeficiency virusâ€“seropositive patients,"OBJECTIVE
We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive working memory (WM) training (WMT) program, the corresponding neural correlates, and LMX1A-rs4657412 polymorphism on the adaptive WMT, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) participants compared to seronegative (SN) controls.


METHODS
A total of 201 of 206 qualified participants completed baseline assessments before randomization to 25 sessions of adaptive WMT or nonadaptive WMT. A total of 74 of 76 (34 HIV, 42 SN) completed adaptive WMT and all 40 completed nonadaptive WMT (20 HIV, 20 SN) and were assessed after 1 month, and 55 adaptive WMT participants were also assessed after 6 months. Nontrained near-transfer WM tests (Digit-Span, Spatial-Span), self-reported executive functioning, and functional magnetic resonance images during 1-back and 2-back tasks were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit, and LMX1A-rs4657412 was genotyped in all participants.


RESULTS
Although HIV participants had slightly lower cognitive performance and start index than SN at baseline, both groups improved on improvement index (>30%; false discovery rate [FDR] corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.0008) and nontrained WM tests after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.001), but not after nonadaptive WMT (training by training type corrected, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01 to pâ€‰=â€‰0.05) 1 month later. HIV participants (especially LMX1A-G carriers) also had poorer self-reported executive functioning than SN, but both groups reported improvements after adaptive WMT (Global: training FDR corrected, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), and only HIV participants improved after nonadaptive WMT. HIV participants also had greater frontal activation than SN at baseline, but brain activation decreased in both groups at 1 and 6 months after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), with normalization of brain activation in HIV participants, especially the LMX1A-AA carriers (LMX1A genotype by HIV status, cluster-corrected-pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001).


INTERPRETATION
Adaptive WMT, but not nonadaptive WMT, improved WM performance in both SN and HIV participants, and the accompanied decreased or normalized brain activation suggest improved neural efficiency, especially in HIV-LMX1A-AA carriers who might have greater dopaminergic reserve. These findings suggest that adaptive WMT may be an effective adjunctive therapy for WM deficits in HIV participants.

2370440272c702114296cfe42a71c6ac7cdfe543,Osteopontin Lung Expression Is a Marker of Disease Severity in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,"Purpose Osteopontin (OPN) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). OPN is upregulated in the lungs of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with pulmonary fibrosis (WHO group III), suggesting that the lung is a source of OPN. We hypothesized that OPN lung expression is elevated in WHO group I PAH and is correlated to hemodynamics. Methods and Materials Microarray analysis (Affymetrix R ) was performed after RNA was extracted from explanted lungs in 15 patients with PAH (6 idiopathic PAH, 4 connective tissue disease, 4 congenital heart disease, 1 chronic thromboembolic PAH) who underwent lung transplantation (LTx) and 11 normal controls (normal lung tissue surrounding cancer resections). Pulmonary artery pressures (PAPs) were recorded intra-operatively immediately before starting LTx: average mPAP was 39Â±11 mmHg, wedge pressure 7Â±5, pulmonary vascular resistance 701Â±208 dym.sec.cm- 5 . Serum OPN levels were measured in 28 subjects with PAH and 5 subjects with normal PAPs. Results OPN was among the top 5 upregulated genes in over 34,000 genes analyzed in PAH compared to normal controls (fold change 3.64, false discovery rate p =0.0007, Mann Whitney). OPN expression was similar and equally high in different types of PAH ( p =n.s., ANOVA). A significant correlation was observed between mPAP and OPN gene expression ( r =0.79, p =0.0004). Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that the OPN gene was included in biologically relevant functions and networks (angiogenesis, cancer, cell death). OPN serum levels were not significantly different in subjects with and without PAH. Conclusions In the lungs of patients with severe PAH who failed medical therapy and underwent LTx, OPN is highly expressed and the level of expression is significantly correlated with disease severity. OPN may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PAH, driving an uncontrolled proliferation of PASMCs.

08989e346930a4105742af8427ab3768c02135eb,Associations of host genetic variants on CD4âº lymphocyte count and plasma HIV-1 RNA in antiretroviral naÃ¯ve children.,"BACKGROUND
CD4 T-lymphocyte (CD4) counts and HIV plasma RNA concentration (RNA) are 2 key HIV disease markers. The complex interplay between virus and host genetics may contribute to differences in viral set point and CD4 status. Determining the effects of host genetic variation on HIV disease markers is often complicated by the use of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, the association between genetic variants and baseline HIV RNA and CD4 counts was examined in a large cohort of antiretroviral naÃ¯ve children.


METHODS
Specimens from 1053 HIV-infected children were screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms in 78 regions from 17 genes. Linear regression with a robust variance estimator was used to test the association between genetic markers with HIV RNA and CD4 count, controlling for age, race/ethnicity and study. False discovery rate (FDR) controlling was used to adjust for multiple testing.


RESULTS
The study population was 60% black, 26% Hispanic and 13% white; median age 2.35 years; 55% female. Baseline median CD4 count was 780/mm; median log10 HIV RNA was 5.17 copies/mL. For analyses of the associations of genetic makers with baseline CD4 count, 6 HLA and 4 additional markers exhibited P < 0.05, but none met the criteria for statistical significance with FDR controlled at 0.05. For baseline HIV RNA, HLA DRB1*15, DRB1*10, B-27/57, B-14, Cw-8, B-57 were statistically significant with FDR controlled at 0.05.


CONCLUSIONS
These results provide strong evidence that HLA DRB1*15, DRB1*10, B-27/57, B-14, Cw-8, B-57 are associated with HIV RNA and play a role in HIV pathogenesis in infected children.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Min Qin"", ids = ""1734459""); list(name = ""Sean S.

241bb83c7e194a9c37227d45621d8a878de2e828,The One Hour Yeast Proteome*,"We describe the comprehensive analysis of the yeast proteome in just over one hour of optimized analysis. We achieve this expedited proteome characterization with improved sample preparation, chromatographic separations, and by using a new Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with a mass filter, a collision cell, a high-field Orbitrap analyzer, and, finally, a dual cell linear ion trap analyzer (Q-OT-qIT, Orbitrap Fusion). This system offers high MS(2) acquisition speed of 20 Hz and detects up to 19 peptide sequences within a single second of operation. Over a 1.3 h chromatographic method, the Q-OT-qIT hybrid collected an average of 13,447 MS(1) and 80,460 MS(2) scans (per run) to produce 43,400 (x) peptide spectral matches and 34,255 (x) peptides with unique amino acid sequences (1% false discovery rate (FDR)). On average, each one hour analysis achieved detection of 3,977 proteins (1% FDR). We conclude that further improvements in mass spectrometer scan rate could render comprehensive analysis of the human proteome within a few hours.",2014,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Alexander S.

7751cda26867f06be2a4d980fc8b8d4580e22134,Changes in white and brown adipose tissue microRNA expression in cold-induced mice.,"There are two classic adipose tissues in mammals, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). It has been well known that browning of WAT can be induced by cold exposure. In this study, to identify the novel cold responsive key miRNAs that are involved in browning, mice were housed at 6 Â°C for 10 days, and deep sequencing of the miRNAs of WAT and BAT was performed. Our data showed that WAT and BAT displayed distinct expression profiles due to their different locations, morphology and biological function. A total of 27 BAT and 29 WAT differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in response to cold stimulation, respectively (fold change >2 and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05), of which, 9 were overlapped in both adipose tissues. Furthermore, the potential target genes of the DE miRNAs from BAT and WAT were predicted computationally, and the KEGG pathway analysis revealed the enrichment pathways in cold stimulated adipose tissues. The expression pattern of miR-144-3p/Bmpr1b/Phlda1 and miR-146a-5p/Sphk2 were further measured by qPCR. Finally, we found that miR-146a-5p was significantly induced during the primary adipogenesis caused by BAT differentiation, whereas miR-144-3p was decreased. Our study identifies for the first time the novel miRNAs involved in browning of WAT by sequencing and expands the therapeutic approaches for combating metabolic diseases.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cong Tao"", ids = ""2136716""); list(name = ""Shujuan Huang"", ids = ""48668566""); list(name = ""Yajun Wang"", ids = ""1727536""); list(name = ""Gang Wei"", ids = ""143728878""); list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""46868248""); list(name = ""Desheng Qi"", ids = ""143948562""); list(name = ""Yanfang Wang"", ids = ""38818560""); list(name = ""Kui Li"", ids = ""144587609"")",972af7c83494cad33d5f3f11ff86a9a543923a63; 145bd734bd630d030a2c27cd4111555c1cde7ef9; 9c4b10300b6916374c9d95de30f7ef878e52b67b; 86435f1b8983876cdeea7bfc3285fb1858a84966; 802e9c29f096e5b35bdd13f94eaee6715cc4aef7; 67a3c36810ff44cb93f3387092ab8d8aabbf902a; a4d148ea9e6f40845732d78fcd18993d6c1ed6da; e0f618318038d9f30da8c4ec81f8550d6d87f97a,54cda01dda8cb25718cf41f518876d5725a9fe82; 4fc792109094b0777887b62ee2648d306bbf1eb6; d42d4a44ed33ac27af9bb26735a6d2a150d23d20; 84d5173fe5b469f804b8170ef6e9d4527f292957; 5b5d04f913b267779cc14e062de553d36c3db26d; 3185592e69604bd84b53f3a53e8c5870d2a8b6f9; 7cf4ec4ee4fdc3101e85315b0ad2f54cb1cabd24; bfc2b0cecf3a96114350f1e0cad00518d145b358; 2f8d8d719ae361f5a08170cc4e52850c4c496dfc; 609b733e65574300cbb9c7d49ae8822a1b19078c; 67b7af4bd4e4621ee529093403acab169a95b223; 395ef02881854e3b1fb4ca656cac4eb711b3f397; cd0a915ce9a06dfaf366b28b3d6441a497083a88; 969a50e79f63e81a2dc9d61726d4ed35cf63db92; 7791875ec20dc3cf477dd1f8ccdd88c85e5e0686; 1a75370bda391c5e019e9c42933cf69cc441f93f; 08fb87dd8f8ce3700caccf160a646f83cfb7a0f2; 72bd9cf8955153cab33a97392d8245b4cc2d24b6; 0f25a0f6b7b30416c16d3cf517edfd52fc8f20bd; b87936bd2fbc5c16d4623a41814f14172cea36b4; 979d6721159586c8a9654e1bfb5ed192ec2cbad4; d9fa6754c265d66226d4b56f037dac2a13d02a28; 94337f064e0b0271f473c618f9de5d4d0b93e34b,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,463 3,"

1fb942ac44a55924b55b882a66c6327d34ed81bb,Incorporating prior knowledge to facilitate discoveries in a genome-wide association study on age-related macular degeneration,"BackgroundSubstantial genotyping data produced by current high-throughput technologies have brought opportunities and difficulties. With the number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) going into millions comes the harsh challenge of multiple-testing adjustment. However, even with the false discovery rate (FDR) control approach, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) may still fall short of discovering any true positive gene, particularly when it has a relatively small sample size.FindingsTo counteract such a harsh multiple-testing penalty, in this report, we incorporate findings from previous linkage and association studies to re-analyze a GWAS on age-related macular degeneration. While previous Bonferroni correction and the traditional FDR approach detected only one significant SNP (rs380390), here we have been able to detect seven significant SNPs with an easy-to-implement prioritized subset analysis (PSA) with the overall FDR controlled at 0.05. These include SNPs within three genes: CFH, CFHR4, and SGCD.ConclusionsBased on the success of this example, we advocate using the simple method of PSA to facilitate discoveries in future GWASs.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wan-Yu Lin"", ids = ""49661239""); list(name = ""Wen-Chung Lee"", ids = ""34044322"")",ffe1c0104ab27c18d827d390b6fa74a2974018af; abed66efc235d0370fe9bd6795cad74191cb948c; c8e7e4e65240e7e75944a3106b3a7a8fbe79025d; d2b767c9caeb61722b69b49382fcf4babe135cf3; 92c6dc9b4943d031200fc5646bc49e927b2cb750; 80f630e00bc50af6e8d999581b36acb6eb2efc3f; c9f8a47af883c5bdd63066c41d1b370c2fe3c2e8; 2f7629fd282412ab180d9a4974dfa4fec995656b; 028fa9c7d742cad1b9066caeece903236c2ff82d; 2ccdb5fcfe1078661e4f8e78ce45f834a31839a2; 024c6e45aa73c4958b3cac19c989a08be1914919; f1b3693de375d454b93b69da80976b63cd80d239; 6cf89707cc5524bf9014cc6098fc7ddde5c94867; a77031db15da51114bae7f1b972ca255994f0677; 8cbee9476661f015c566dd24484f414af5796045; e28e6e29c74598187899581ef6254b16af63cd9b,ea6bc3a5e5eba09d96ebcc4a8d537bbca88582e0; 8898c1681d5ea599d078bb99833b750998dad588; e65c9d4536264e82de65a248e784e60773cba7ed; ce2605f83e604a55beafdc4bc003c5979c8d794a; a1f997ecbdcffd94f3887d89ebbed7a8337cc0ad; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; a73a7da87109e421a670a827ed6c09bc820627d3; b77a86b4786666510a1372fecc0d1cc3c824f843; 6b4f764008ada0c2c1ec893aebb594b3248de71e; 05d1c272f3535571f3413b29916695e54ed636b6; cd5181ff502afb229c9037cd7c6f49a59b8f50b0; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; 54cf7c48c4a84e522511b80619b9b790da8a527a; 50b8e1ac8936c864fbe155bc4ec3dbd61b5beab4; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 81c95f702a686281cc25e6babe79c31962769a98; dd1b3822a5d94e1de43845a9917be3e6a4ebfbe4; 9cabc6c0e9b5d24e78eba6a5bcecdcfbd24c5449; 11943fd64168ab249872b135b1f18aca5ce14961; f2aaa3f3a1f9f9e3760929661299552d7792d190; 930000cd89036622bddf8a62bb3b84deb58e97b5; d3c43126ba3c72d728f7efc3e8dcd907c497ee02; a645b08ac3add6368f959a6e0a9f0e59f68fb846; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 1e1cd872b573b892a40b4e32b844309d4e0cb63e; 1db5c1d04f85e6886e51b6dde9bb047e2ace3334; 15064e235d668ef9698d17a1a1c9c0e7b7a8a8c5; 50a76e6fec50fbf9d6a3f090f61a5b312cac09ca; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; a4162f29b439b7b74a3ef1a90a49c401de8895f7,BMC Research Notes,3,26 - 26

For many high-throughput technologies, the cost still limits their application. Two-stage designs are attractive, in which a set of interesting features or biomarkers is identified in a first stage and then followed up in a second stage. However, to our knowledge, no two-stage FDR control with HMMs has been developed. In this paper, we study an efficient HMMâ€“FDR-based two-stage design, using a simple integrated analysis procedure across the stages. Numeric studies show its excellent performance when compared to available methods. A power analysis method is also proposed.

913ad029e3b1160ad32013e281fa906dc09abbee,Cognitive impairment and structural brain damage in benign multiple sclerosisSYMBOL,"Objective:Although in benign multiple sclerosis (BMS) locomotor disability is absent or only minimal, subclinical cognitive impairment seems to occur in many cases. Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI enables us to quantify the extent of â€œactualâ€ tissue damage, which goes undetected when using conventional MRI. Against this background, we investigated the extent of structural brain damage underlying cognitive dysfunction in BMS, with the ultimate aim to move a first step toward a more reliable definition of this disease phenotype. Methods:Conventional and DT MRI scans of the brain were acquired from 62 BMS patients. Thirty-six secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients and 19 healthy subjects served as controls. In BMS patients, neuropsychological tests exploring memory, attention, and frontal lobe functions were administered. Normalized brain volume (NBV), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and MD of the gray matter (GM) were computed. Results:Twelve BMS patients (19%) fulfilled predefined criteria for cognitive impairment. BMS patients had abnormal MD and FA values from both NAWM and GM. Whereas BMS patients without cognitive impairment had lower T2 LV (p = 0.03), higher NBV (p = 0.006), and lower average GM MD (p = 0.03) than SPMS patients, BMS patients with cognitive impairment did not significantly differ from SPMS patients for any MRI-derived metric. Conclusions:In benign multiple sclerosis (BMS), cognitive dysfunction is associated with severe structural brain damage, which resembles that of patients with a much more disabling disease course. A reliable definition of BMS should, therefore, include the preservation of cognitive functioning as an additional requisite.

DNA microarray technologies allow us to monitor expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. A basic task in analyzing microarray data is the identification of differentially expressed genes under different experimental conditions. The null hypothsis is no association between the expression levels and explanatory variables or covariates. Family-wise error rate (FWER), although very conservative, controls type I error. False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a less stringent approach which aims to control the expected proportion of Type I errors among the rejected hypotheses. Since there are thousands of genes tested simultaneously, FDR may be enhanced. High correlation between tested genes, attributed to co-regulations and dependency in the measurement errors, further complicates the problem. Most of the current FDR procedures assume independence or rather restrictive dependence structures, resulting in being less reliable. In this work, we address these very large multiplicity problems by adopting a two-stage FDR controlling procedure under suitable dependence structures and based on Poisson distributional approximation, which eliminates the need to assume restricted dependence structures. We compare the performance of the proposed FDR procedure with that of other FDR controlling procedures, with illustration of the leukemia microarray study of Golub et al. (1999) and simulated data. In these studies, the proposed FDR procedure has greater power without much elevation of FDR. Current FDR procedures have not been used extensively in genomic sequences involving count or discrete, or purely qualitative responses, confronted with high-dimensional",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Moonsu Kang"", ids = ""2020907"")",d71454dab60c43f5cc10dc19db623c9b0a718eea; 5a65efed91648d98df75203759a5828549ca9d04; 0892c15703ba92487682ff1274066865e21e2bf5,bc757db256e3e53ee16762af4a04985ecd80a5c2; 3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; bd104aab5b037418188ba4369f7e06df4a20de70; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; 0ddf2646929ce22bb189ef0e6232fcea4e5404c2; fce009e245d2af43003c7bf7dd34d4ecd0476a05; df55cf1849590b85391191083aaf887dc5aceccd; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 703994d9c0de91777ff741b27c9afa227182a7cf; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 66e663af13f17f14ada835afb2bf77c21ab87bda; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 131b69299bca0e92ed37db82fda604e7a01c5aeb; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; e57551940815c70c193004c5f265b0bb3543bf15; b4314f72b0ebb9b49cd8d8d559a2b78cfe3f4bd2; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; ca7db249461d827886c03c22a3585346a15e4332; f76398dcde5c88ec607503d438d6967875cf7fe4; 477d23483b06c5f0bdbf164772a6d599ba0a8b93; 095696d2a79fa7912dd79dc381e0b70de34410ad; be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 67dec036f7bb9098e9fbf525063ab34e96b513b8; d7f7e091e01be79e6ddca7c273021d7dae136fdf; 07f77b7b6dd42ef6019d95e2fcfe7746d9094805; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7b4ae2d731fc82dca08f303ed3263f9878f305de; 29c532a3c8abf9bd32aca1af8ba1a9f477b6ef4a; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; e87e9aaa1c250e4e2f0a99cc38c290874f794ee5; ac3f73cf3aff3fb29aefbe976975a577bec23977; 1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558; 3fec56c823eaf62632a6501acb003f5ffa0751ec; 002ea7f5cb5ad283292658e95788d15f657c587e; 278f914ee2c9e0bfcdb96a5d0f6a6cd625b6a7bf; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 3473cbfa824aac9318602a66f6772862863a2b50; 9b6926a01fd998e0a7fe7e5ca1ae83593cd16236; b61f7635b2715e1ada8d3a55f013b64655b3d85c; 040f26ece8e6c4bb627c73a622e047dfd3ee7604; 68424ea4f51203fee6e4240cb8835e595b31504c; b945af198d84311797bc7114a8a636127e906ea3; 827b315822032ee79ceec4f6b9d2e4272d6787f6; 97ffbe88f79c1f4b5314da1a2d233da35d192d53; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 3bc99acdb070ca6284573a578d39d7f436579eca; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; c67af957b4ceef21eb55922e9dd6ad8635915855,,,

AD research using MRI has focused on early changes in medial temporal and cortical gray matter. Although caudate atrophy is more typical of motor disorders such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease (Nakamura et al. 2001), beta-amyloid and tau pathology accumulates in the caudate in AD (Braak and Braak, 1990). Here we mapped 3D patterns of caudate atrophy in a large cohort of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and matched elderly control subjects. We tested whether caudate atrophy is associated with: (1) clinical scores (MMSE, CDR) and their decline over a 1-year follow-up period; (2) conversion from MCI to AD; (3) immediate and delayed Logical Memory scores from the Wechsler Memory Scale; (4) CSF Aï¢, tauï€¬ï€ p-tau levels; and (5) age, sex, ApoE genotype, and body mass index.

2e0081fdf8e1751ff651d6ba7c607be95bd92d0f,Local Network Topology in Human Protein Interaction Data Predicts Functional Association,"The use of high-throughput techniques to generate large volumes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has increased the need for methods that systematically and automatically suggest functional relationships among proteins. In a yeast PPI network, previous work has shown that the local connection topology, particularly for two proteins sharing an unusually large number of neighbors, can predict functional association. In this study we improved the prediction scheme by developing a new algorithm and applied it on a human PPI network to make a genome-wide functional inference. We used the new algorithm to measure and reduce the influence of hub proteins on detecting function-associated protein pairs. We used the annotations of the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as benchmarks to compare and evaluate the function relevance. The application of our algorithms to human PPI data yielded 4,233 significant functional associations among 1,754 proteins. Further functional comparisons between them allowed us to assign 466 KEGG pathway annotations to 274 proteins and 123 GO annotations to 114 proteins with estimated false discovery rates of <21% for KEGG and <30% for GO. We clustered 1,729 proteins by their functional associations and made functional inferences from detailed analysis on one subcluster highly enriched in the TGF-beta signaling pathway (P<10(-50)). Analysis of another four subclusters also suggested potential new players in six signaling pathways worthy of further experimental investigations.

e2b92710176a7a799b2c868029c86ca502da7feb,Patterns of gene expression among murine models of hemorrhagic shock/trauma and sepsis.,"Controversy remains whether the leukocyte genomic response to trauma or sepsis is dependent upon the initiating stimulus. Previous work illustrated poor correlations between historical models of murine trauma and sepsis (i.e., trauma-hemorrhage and lipopolysaccharide injection, respectively). The aim of this study is to examine the early genomic response in improved murine models of sepsis [cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)] and trauma [polytrauma (PT)] with and without pneumonia (PT+Pp). Groups of naÃ¯ve, CLP, PT, and PT+Pp mice were killed at 2 h, 1 or 3 days. Total leukocytes were isolated for genome-wide expression analysis, and genes that were found to differ from control (false discovery rate adjusted P < 0.001) were assessed for fold-change differences. Spearman correlations were also performed. For all time points combined (CLP, PT, PT+Pp), there were 10,426 total genes that were found to significantly differ from naÃ¯ve controls. At 2 h, the transcriptomic changes between CLP and PT showed a positive correlation (rs) of 0.446 (P < 0.0001) but were less positive thereafter. Correlations were significantly improved when we limited the analysis to common genes whose expression differed by a 1.5 fold-change. Both pathway and upstream analyses revealed the activation of genes known to be associated with pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular pattern signaling, and early activation patterns of expression were very similar between polytrauma and sepsis at the earliest time points. This study demonstrates that the early leukocyte genomic response to sepsis and trauma are very similar in mice.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juan C.

ff79e1e0ecf2fdcf787e37af3bb9881862bb1d5a,False Discovery Rate for Wavelet-Based,"Model-based statistical analysis of functional mag- netic resonance imaging (fMRI) data relies on the general linear model and statistical hypothesis testing. Due to the large number of intracranial voxels, it is important to deal with the multiple comparisons problem. Many fMRI analysis tools utilize Gaussian random field theory to obtain a more sensitive thresholding; this typically involves Gaussian smoothing as a preprocessing step. Wavelet-based statistical parametric mapping (WSPM) is an al- ternative method to obtain parametric maps from non-smoothed data. It relies on adaptive thresholding of the parametric maps in the wavelet domain, followed by voxel-wise statistical testing. The procedure is conservative; it uses Bonferroni correction for strong type I error control. Yet, its sensitivity is close to SPM's due to the excellent denoising properties of the wavelet transform. Here, we adapt the false discovery rate (FDR) principle to the WSPM framework. Although explicit -values cannot be obtained, we show that it is possible to retrieve the FDR threshold by a simple iterative scheme. We then validate the approach with an event-re- lated visual stimulation task. Our results show better sensitivity with preservation of spatial resolution; i.e., activation clusters align well with the gray matter structures in the visual cortex. The spatial resolution of the activation maps is even high enough to easily identify a voxel that is very likely to be caused by the draining-vein effect.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Dimitri Van De Ville"", ids = ""1748289""); list(name = ""Michael Unser"", ids = ""51027413"")",839b59d5600cb00b2ca9cb452fc6c43aa7d259b7,,,,
590c0ac99d70cb96fce62d0481c6740157b7f181,MicroRNA-messenger RNA interactions involving JAK-STAT signaling genes in colorectal cancer,"JAK-STAT signaling influences many downstream processes that, unchecked, contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are hypothesized as a mechanism to prevent uncontrolled growth from continuous JAK-STAT activation. We investigated differential expression between paired carcinoma and normal colorectal mucosa of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and miRNAs using RNA-Seq and Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V19.0 data, respectively, using a negative binomial mixed effects model to test 122 JAK-STAT-signaling genes in 217 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. Overall, 42 mRNAs were differentially expressed with a fold change of >1.50 or <0.67, remaining significant with a false discovery rate of < 0.05; four were dysregulated in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, eight were for microsatellite unstable (MSI)-specific tumors. Of these 54 mRNAs, 17 were associated with differential expression of 46 miRNAs, comprising 116 interactions: 16 were significant overall, one for MSS tumors only. Twenty of the 29 interactions with negative beta coefficients involved miRNA seed sequence matches with mRNAs, supporting miRNA-mediated mRNA repression; 17 of these mRNAs encode for receptor molecules. Receptor molecule degradation is an established JAK-STAT signaling control mechanism; our results suggest that miRNAs facilitate this process. Interactions involving positive beta coefficients may illustrate downstream effects of disrupted STAT activity, and subsequent miRNA upregulation.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lila E Mullany"", ids = ""6198042""); list(name = ""Jennifer S.

Expression of the cry34Ab1 and cry35Ab1 genes confers resistance to corn rootworms, and the pat gene confers tolerance to herbicides containing glufosinate-ammonium. Sixty crossbred steers (396 kg) were individually fed either transgenic corn (DAS-59122-7; 59122), a near-isogenic, nontransgenic control (Control), and a conventional, nontransgenic corn for 109 d to evaluate nutritional equivalency (20 steers/treatment). The corn was coarsely rolled (geometric mean diameter = 4,200 Âµm) and treatments were offered in the finishing diet at 82% of diet DM. Gain (P = 0.38) and G:F (P = 0.80) were similar between 59122 and Control with a tendency for a difference in DMI (P = 0.08). When adjusted using the statistical analysis of false discovery rate, DMI, ADG, and G:F were not different between Control and 59122 (P > 0.33). No differences were observed between Control and 59122 for HCW, marbling score, LM area, fat depth, or calculated USDA YG (P > 0.12). The genetically modified corn DAS-59122-7 was nutritionally equivalent to a near-isogenic control when fed to finishing steers. Feeding corn grain containing these transgenic traits did not influence steer performance or carcass quality.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Taia J. Huls"", ids = ""16592477""); list(name = ""Galen E.

The aim of this study was to identify candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may play aÂ role in the susceptibility to glioma, to elucidate their potential mechanisms, and to generate SNP-to-gene-to-pathway hypotheses.A genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of glioma including 509,345 SNPs from 1,856 glioma patients and 4,955 control subjects of European descent was used in this study. Identify candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis was applied to the GWAS dataset.ICSNPathway analysis identified 6 candidate SNPs, 5 genes, and 9 pathways, which revealed 5 hypothetical biological mechanisms. The hypothetical mechanisms, beginning with the strongest, are summarized as follows: (i) rs667128 alters the role of taste receptor, type 2, member 8 (TAS2R8) in taste receptor activity and taste transduction pathways (p < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001; pÂ = 0.001, FDR = 0.012, respectively), (ii) rs619381 modulates the effect of taste receptor, type 2, member 7 (TAS2R7) on taste receptor activity and taste transduction (p < 0.001, FDR < 0.001; pÂ = 0.001, FDR = 0.012), (iii) rs1033583 modulates delta-like protein 1 (DLL1), regulating cell adhesion and segment specification (p < 0.001, FDR = 0.011; pÂ = 0.001, FDR = 0.032), (iv) rs2232580 affects the role of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in the response to lipopolysaccharide, positive regulation of interleukin-6 production, acute inflammatory response, and in macrophage activation (0.002 â‰¤ pÂ â‰¤ 0.013; 0.012 â‰¤ FDR â‰¤ 0.030), and (v) rs4644 and rs4652 regulate lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 3 (LGALS3), affecting immunoglobulin binding (p = 0.010; FDR = 0.040).Using the ICSNPathway to analyze glioma GWAS data, 6 candidate SNPs, 5 genes (TAS2R8, TAS2R7, DLL1, LBP, and LGALS3), and 9 pathways that may contribute to the susceptibility of glioma were identified.

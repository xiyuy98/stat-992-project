7340980be2368263f2fa2073603049f17c9b08d8,A statistical approach for detecting common features,"BACKGROUND
With increasing numbers of datasets in neuroimaging studies, it has become an important task to pool information, in order to increase the statistical power of tests and for cross validation. However, no robust global approach unambiguously identifies the common biological abnormalities in, for example, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a number of mental disorders, where there are multiple datasets/attributes. Here we propose a novel and efficient statistical approach to this problem that finds common features in multiple datasets.


NEW METHOD
By collecting the statistics of each dataset into a vector, our method uses a 'multi-dimensional local false discovery' rate to pool information and make full use of the joint distribution of datasets.


RESULTS
We have tested our approach extensively on both simulated and clinical datasets. By conducting simulation studies, we find that our approach has a higher statistical power than existing approaches, especially on correlated datasets. Employing our approach on clinical data yields findings that are consistent with the existing literature.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
Conventional methods cannot determine the false discovery rate underlying multiple datasets/attributes. Our approach can effectively handle these datasets. It has a solid Bayesian interpretation, and a higher power than other approaches in numerical simulations. This can be explained by the incorporation of correlations, between different attributes, into the new method.


CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we present a natural, novel and powerful statistical approach to tackle situations involving multiple datasets or attributes. This new method has significant advantages over existing approaches and wide applications.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinjun Gan"", ids = ""8245595""); list(name = ""Bing Xu"", ids = ""144862247""); list(name = ""Xiaoxi Ji"", ids = ""6248203""); list(name = ""Wenlian Lu"", ids = ""1723706""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Feng"", ids = ""145775107"")",,7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; e3e8b45639bac066af9dacb9a2f294673c7e0ec6; eee742a5c10fa51f2809b5add40932ad2aa7b8d9; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 0b9930266112c8b0684343f741cf83cf2b9a1da2; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; 10eefef6bdb8e71979ed7a072b03af12e9c0fdb7; c1e053151f289359eb5211cdb76ee07f1ee7881f; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f544a821130790d4be642ad4b2ae6da45da5c82e; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 71c7a7f6e80bd0094e9b494b5eb702853aa92408; 504d2a8d6e07bf3aa084e9f558aeb3f458ec3444; 465f280063d3990637d4f4a6e10a70851062b4f1; 98de1ce1dadcc94cf7ae0ac469a1c5b70464c8d4; 7f738730d5f27643f2e36983b4b617c709d1ccdf; cfaa9a5afdaf5901bcfce61bcc855b6685de671b; 28a215515d10b0ccadef846c61894e2e8a4ff65a; 6149eafe208fa797ef139f65d26206f5643b0c9d; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; 98217b3c462c9b68b0d3d8eafca1e3d9e9a6db83; fac715b131d9ffcbc7a4132b2c12f25a885e172f; 25897bc629171073a21cef5ac3871e16a428877e; 2303426d61b113f4ff6d5cc25e8e2e2f9794112e; 69bebfb1c3d8a2177ee6c15996917e814a0d4aba; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 1a73855c4e5553c1759ef6524435f4e822906a3d; 1476f61b9caf929a978c62eecd1f247e7a89671e; e6d681ce999a79964d02c3a4d4a873f4e708f241; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; b798e74cf8954daae13e4b31c4fed5f4a78035ec; 3a1e3a3a7c125590db2dcc49d324b5b3ca0b7c6a; 4a0068a4af268eaa30c4bc66518a1b33612a7ff2; f6b403634dfb45f22005598db606def62e001043; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 68e574435642d83c04040d78dadec67690099953; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; c49f966a2d079c9adf85d53ed44205b378bc3094; d3a603ea9664d3dc8911875e16d1fd22e46cd10b; ee5a9fe60223343066469ef092e9b3e04c740c09,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,247,1-12
bd82e952bcc833e682f894c068fd694ebbd01d1c,Abstract 1117: Comprehensive genomic characterization of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the Cancer Genome Atlas.,"Proceedings: AACR 104th Annual Meeting 2013; Apr 6-10, 2013; Washington, DC

Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the United States and Worldwide. Most cancers are tobacco-related, although an increasing number of tumors are found in nonsmokers in association with the human papilloma virus (HPV).

Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is conducting DNA, RNA and miRNA sequencing along with DNA copy number profiling, quantification of mRNA expression, promoter methylation, and reverse-phase protein arrays on surgically resected samples from previously untreated patients with HNSCC. We report for the first time the results for 279 HNSCC samples for whom complete data are available.

Results: The demographics of 279 patients enrolled in the study documented a median age of 61 years (range: 19-90); 27% female, and history of tobacco smoking in 80%. Over 30 sites of significant somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) were identified, most of which were shared with recently reported alterations in lung squamous cell carcinoma. However, some notable SCNA were absent in HNSCC: PDGFRA amplification and deletion of FOXP. Similarly, SCNA were compared between HPV + and HPV - tumors identifying numerous differences, including a paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase alterations in HPV + tumors and novel deletions in chromosome 11q and 14q. Exome sequencing revealed at least 15 significantly mutated genes at the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of <0.01, including: CDKN2A, TP53, PIK3CA, FAT1, MLL2, TGFBR2, HLA-A, NOTCH1, HRAS, NFE2L2, and CASP8. Consideration of differences between HPV + and HPV - tumors suggested differences which included nearly universal alteration of TP53 and frequent p16 mutations in HPV - tumors. By contrast, few TP53 or CDKN2A mutations were observed in HPV + samples. Strikingly, a large number of co-occurring genomic alterations were observed. For example, mutations of HRAS were observed nearly universally in combination with either CASP8 or FAT1. All three of these mutations were absent in HPV + patients. mRNA expression profiling revealed four distinct expression subtypes, each one enriched with distinct SCNA and mutational profiles: classical, basal, mesenchymal, and atypical. Deep sequencing by multiple platforms allowed for a detailed accounting of the role of HPV in alterations of the cancer genomes of HNSCC patients, including integration sites, disruption of tumor suppressor genes, and more complex rearrangements. Potential therapeutic targets for clinical trials with currently available drugs will be discussed.

Conclusions: HNSCC is a heterogeneous tumor which displays distinctive patterns of somatic alteration potentially amenable to molecularly targeted therapies. We document for the first time using TCGA data, the role of an oncogenic virus in the human cancer genome. Results presented on behalf of TCGA.

38c61bde54f2520581b600de3916d758bad75264,Association of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) single nucleotide polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"The etiology and pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not completely understood although it is often associated with other conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in human lipid metabolism that facilitates the removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the bloodstream. LPL hydrolyzes the core of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein) into free fatty acids and monoacylglycerol. To gain insight into the possible role of LPL in T2DM, nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LPL were analyzed for the association with T2DM using 944 unrelated Koreans, including 474 T2DM subjects and 470 normal healthy controls. Of the nine LPL SNPs we analyzed, a significant association with multiple tests by the false discovery rate (FDR) was observed between T2DM and SNP rs343 (+13836C>A in intron 3). SNP rs343 was also marginally associated with some of T2DM-related phenotypes including total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), and log transformed glycosylated hemoglobin in 470 normal controls, although no significant association was detected by multiple tests. In total, our results suggest that the control of lipid level by LPL in the bloodstream might be an important factor in T2DM pathogenesis in the Korean population.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yoon Shin Cho"", ids = ""144249032""); list(name = ""Min Jin Go"", ids = ""3025002""); list(name = ""Hye Ree Han"", ids = ""14207021""); list(name = ""Seung-Hun Cha"", ids = ""11371778""); list(name = ""Hung-Tae Kim"", ids = ""15110582""); list(name = ""Haesook Min"", ids = ""50206429""); list(name = ""Hyoung Doo Shin"", ids = ""4260580""); list(name = ""Chan Park"", ids = ""1728248""); list(name = ""Bok-ghee Han"", ids = ""6070938""); list(name = ""Nam Han Cho"", ids = ""145482287""); list(name = ""Chol Shin"", ids = ""50447587""); list(name = ""Kuchan Kimm"", ids = ""2372813""); list(name = ""Bermseok Oh"", ids = ""145899745"")",50f567387d39e2d1c3106bc219d69a286e9aed6b; e12f20a60b1993ccc0746ac88a36a3a614f205a3; 74eb3b1bc548fbbbc1651e5840be760aed86b0ab; dd43ab78f3767de90f626d3780f61a156e0fc788; fa17da6bfa3f27ab29833014e3a20ce71126eb8e; 84e0ed8f42af842edc54ee2e3862e2d645822d27; 21876e877f737d716e423c6867cfebacb11d86a2; be582a798e150671e11161b2f8251a9b84912922; a3eeffaeb1a06940de4b9ccfa5d40af383f18775; d0f05584a824da020630b2b37a4a26789c5e5fb9; 290637f081d82495bdbb49fbe20ff523301bc13d; fcb7d992d789e5070a18c3619fb7905513d4300f,259899dda6102738648b5beee70b98d7317b2280; a16ed2167d76f422e117d037f47c6f2070fc8d07; 8fda3282a75c008660f728c07d1282dcde7ada0d; e35e790ba0ff7812b98a815fc8de6271b994fb59; 03e1e8c4f794184142ffee946022ed77e8de19d3; 35a1668a1dd6008319bf28de0166b0d89520af66; 4aa550f3835bd19bee3d95931e7f7f7516c8b900; d65c8e45296ee9a459160185dde63a1ad4f05358; a187a83fa868bd468f9f1f98e40edc74d3698c72; 0deb20f69029fc251004d5cf51bf4f446a122216; a0df0bab3701b9b0f2914253ac6c033a8aeb3948; 8299017ba0d0cbcae8b75b7943f23a150c301552; 59653ba5b9eb3d812fddb44b8ac4661caa008730; f7db5ff0408880c6f2128cb72cae00aa70226fb5; fcdc5149006cc9f376541f9797c284e5d91c244c; 3baa9ad345042b759d174b9f5d9c79cecc0f49e2; 0db85df16cda591a62893d94fa1f9d7bd61958d7; b5b91c96ba47a092fcf03aa7f8a20b7ba8be36bf; e26b2804e4d12e0391893c496d46fdbd832dd1a2; 2594dc8cddbcdf7e641c7da5b81dd5ccde6294f8; be06541f4c281c2a8e5236fedefc2b01aab96e74; 4da1d2ac7a2458e5ec2913950ae2e6a043f76e0e; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; c6d1baff006f163da82bc76a70c82a97c6c8095e; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; d14f05c63267fe5a2addd07889007ae0ace1ad92; 4168f0bccdb1950de80abfd40f931a1e8ce56c97; 584e52f0d4ea516c268614664fcbff48074c5fd6; 8f6f30cc26305f50301876d71d42c7e8d157bc16; 6cc1288836746cd25e3654ade387331d33f98ba7; fb5b8aa88f74dcb0748cbaed7fd6cdbd02610742; 461c10576f4c37b9f7978329aae72994e2e53ef0; 9d497323f031a1f18370cafdd63c6dd9965032e9; 2ddb7026698d9093b6dfa8cf4c8289f239b21e1b; 278c058110ed05d9dc5945370b243c648140179b; 1b0ede6caa56b12d774d7b0c49a8e21d28cee9b1; b9c33773da6837f4d1db99c027ff33087f99e093; 5f6cb334975543df357433a64b429f137f0686cd; 5cb6bdb441d2215f1f3677216476e4a622eafe57; bbc18bd3061ece35daa584c0f439185c72e2e6dc,Experimental & Molecular Medicine,40,523-532

Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic inflammatory disease that is associated with substantial morbidity. The aim of this study was to understand the biology underlying WG and to discover markers of disease activity that would be useful for prognosis and treatment guidance.


METHODS
Gene expression profiling was performed using total RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and granulocyte fractions from 41 patients with WG and 23 healthy control subjects. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to search for candidate WG-associated molecular pathways and disease activity biomarkers. Principal components analysis was used to visualize relationships between subgroups of WG patients and controls. Longitudinal changes in proteinase 3 (PR3) gene expression were evaluated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and clinical outcomes, including remission status and disease activity, were determined using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for WG (BVAS-WG).


RESULTS
Eighty-six genes in WG PBMCs and 40 in WG polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were significantly up-regulated relative to controls. Genes up-regulated in WG PBMCs were involved in myeloid differentiation, and these included the WG autoantigen PR3. The coordinated regulation of myeloid differentiation genes was confirmed by GSEA. The median expression values of the 86 up-regulated genes in WG PBMCs were associated with disease activity (P = 1.3 x 10(-4)), and WG patients with low-level expression of the WG signature genes showed expression profiles that were only modestly different from that in healthy controls (P = 0.07). PR3 transcription was significantly up-regulated in WG PBMCs (P = 1.3 x 10(-5), false discovery rate [FDR] 0.002), but not in WG PMNs (P = 0.03, FDR 0.28), and a preliminary longitudinal analysis showed that the fold change in PR3 RNA levels in WG PBMCs corresponded to changes in the BVAS-WG score over time.


CONCLUSION
Transcription of PR3 and related myeloid differentiation genes in PBMCs may represent novel markers of disease activity in WG.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chris Cheadle"", ids = ""3086882""); list(name = ""Alan E.

a450a5562753b5bbb30ee4ee28f603d38dcf5789,PTMiner: Localization and Quality Control of Protein Modifications Detected in an Open Search and Its Application to Comprehensive Post-translational Modification Characterization in Human Proteome.,"The open (mass tolerant) search of tandem mass spectra of peptides shows great potential in the comprehensive detection of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in shotgun proteomics. However, this search strategy has not been widely used by the community, and one bottleneck of it is the lack of appropriate algorithms for automated and reliable post-processing of the coarse and error-prone search results. Here we present PTMiner, a software tool for confident filtering and localization of modifications (mass shifts) detected in an open search. After mass-shift-grouped false discovery rate (FDR) control of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), PTMiner uses an empirical Bayesian method to localize modifications through iterative learning of the prior probabilities of each type of modification occurring on different amino acids. The performance of PTMiner was evaluated on three data sets, including simulated data, chemically synthesized peptide library data and modified-peptide spiked-in proteome data. The results showed that PTMiner can effectively control the PSM FDR and accurately localize the modification sites. At 1% real false localization rate (FLR), PTMiner localized 93%, 84 and 83% of the modification sites in the three data sets, respectively, far higher than two open search engines we used and an extended version of the Ascore localization algorithm. We then used PTMiner to analyze a draft map of human proteome containing 25 million spectra from 30 tissues, and confidently identified over 1.7 million modified PSMs at 1% FDR and 1% FLR, which provided a system-wide view of both known and unknown PTMs in the human proteome.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zhiwu An"", ids = ""30935312""); list(name = ""Linhui Zhai"", ids = ""38179988""); list(name = ""Wantao Ying"", ids = ""46642806""); list(name = ""Xiaohong Qian"", ids = ""35216786""); list(name = ""Fuzhou Gong"", ids = ""50654631""); list(name = ""Minjia Tan"", ids = ""4517139""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817033"")",7e9600efb42435ed323dff843df52e5fc0bbbe61; 0c85c92f444499301488ac968b3ec0799cfa2bcf,,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,18 2,"

f0bc4634e9c9bd8ab490136b209b867d4f4c43ed,Abstract C3: Bclâ€2 inhibition in Chondrosarcoma leads to increased apoptosis and is a promising therapeutic target,"Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilageâ€forming tumors of the bone and are notorious for their resistance to chemoâ€ and radiotherapy. Chondrosarcomas consist of slowly dividing cells and show overexpression of BCL2. A correlation between BCL2 expression and malignant transformation of osteochondromas to peripheral chondrosarcomas has been found as well as BCL2 positivity in 30â€“67% of central chondrosarcomas, increasing with grade. As BCL2 is an antiâ€apoptotic protein, inhibition could lead to resensitization of tumor cells to conventional therapy. This study aims at inducing apoptosis in chondrosarcomas insensitive to conventional treatment measures. ABT737 is a BH3 mimetic which inhibits antiâ€apoptotic proteins. BCL2 inhibition has been proven to work in leukemia cells. Expression of proâ€ and antiâ€apoptotic genes was studied using Illumina human expression bead chip v3 microarrays on 23 solitary chondrosarcomas and 6 normal cartilage tissues for comparison using R software. ABT737 was tested for its ability to induce apoptosis in 4 chondrosarcoma cell lines and 4 primary cultures (SW1353, OUMS27, CH2879, JJ012, and L835, L869, L1081, L1250, respectively). HL60, an ALL cell line, was used as a positive control. ABT737 was also tested in combination with Doxorubicin and Cisplatin. Cell viability was assessed using WST assay measuring mitochondrial activity; cell count was performed with the CaseyÂ® cell counter. Induction of apoptosis was determined using Life Cell Imaging where apoptotic cells were labeled with Cy5â€labelled AnnexinV. During Life Cell Imaging ABT737 was also combined with Roscovitine, an MCL1 inhibitor. FACS analysis on cell cycle was performed with DAPI staining. After comparing solitary chondrosarcomas to normal cartilage tissue, the antiâ€apoptotic MCL1 (logFc 0.6, p=0.02) and BAD (logFc=0.5, p=0.007) were overexpressed in chondrosarcoma. Pâ€values were False Discovery Rate adjusted. A loss in cell number (IC50: 2 M) and viability (IC50: 20 M) after 72 hours incubation with ABT737 was achieved. 25ÂµMABT737 in combination with 10ÂµM Doxorubicin led to 85% reduction in cell viability in L869 and 65% reduction in other cultures. Life Cell Imaging showed a strong induction of apoptosis in cells treated with ABT737 alone (650%) over 72 hours of treatment. For Doxorubicin 10 M 560% increase in apoptotic cells was observed and for Roscovitine 10 M the total increase in apoptotic cells was 400%. Combining ABT737 with Roscovitine or Doxorubicin showed a total increase in apoptotic cell number of 430%. Combining ABT737 with doxorubicin showed no additional onset of apoptosis during the last 24 hours. By adding the BH3 mimic ABT737 to Doxorubicin treatment in chondrosarcoma cultures, an additional 20% decrease in cell viability can be obtained. However, by counting apoptotic cells, no such decrease could be observed, suggesting that the additional 20% is a cytostatic effect rather than a cytotoxic. Accordingly, preliminary data obtained with FACS analysis on cell cycle show a 10% increase of cells in G1 phase after ABT737 and Doxorubicin treatment, compared to ABT737 treatment alone. In conclusion, BCL2 overexpression seems to play an important part in chemoresistance in chondrosarcoma, and coâ€treatment of ABT737 with Doxorubicin causes the vast majority of chondrosarcoma cells to enter apoptosis while the remaining cells enter cell cycle arrest.

4f7c19668df03a72aa749903aad04882d8e3180e,Differences in gene and protein expression and the effects of race/ethnicity on breast cancer subtypes.,"BACKGROUND
Differences in gene or protein expression patterns between breast cancers according to race/ethnicity and cancer subtype.


METHODS
Transcriptional profiling was performed using Affymetrix HG-U133A platform in 376 patients and reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA) was done for 177 proteins in 255 patients from a separate cohort. Unsupervised clustering was conducted, as well as supervised comparison by race and tumor subtype. Standard statistical methods, BRB-Array tools, and Ingenuity Pathways software packages were used to analyze the data.


RESULTS
Median age was 50 years in both the cohorts. In the RPPA cohort, 54.5% of the tumors were hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive), 20.7% HER2-positive, and 24.71% triple-negative (TNBC). One hundred and forty-seven (57.6%), 47 (18.43%), and 46 (18.1%) of the patients were White, Hispanic, and Black, respectively. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the protein expression data showed no distinct clusters by race (P values were 0.492, 0.489, and 0.494 for the HR-positive, HER2-positive, and TNBC tumors respectively). In the gene expression cohort, 54.2% of the tumors were HR-positive, 16.5% HER2-positive, and 29.3% TNBC. Two hundred and sixteen (57.5%), 111 (29.52%), and 32 (8.52%) patients were White, Hispanic, and Black, respectively. No probe set with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 showed an association with race by breast cancer subtype; similar results were obtained using pathway and gene set enrichment analysis methods.


CONCLUSIONS
We did not detect a significant variation in RNA or protein expression comparing different race/ethnicity groups of women with breast cancer.

ba7910e2fc72fb797f32a96a3bb0a403ceb905f2,Relationship between the hippocampal shape abnormality and serum cortisol levels in firstâ€episode and drugâ€naÃ¯ve major depressive disorder patients,"BACKGROUND
We aimed to investigate the relationship between the hippocampal shape deformations and the serum cortisol levels in first-episode and drug-naÃ¯ve major depression disorder (MDD) patients.


METHODS
Thirty first-episode and drug-naÃ¯ve MDD patients and 40 healthy subjects were recruited. High-resolution T1-weighted imaging and morning blood samples for cortisol measurement were obtained from all MDD patients and healthy subjects. In the hippocampal shape analysis, we compared the hippocampal shape between MDD patients and healthy subjects and evaluated the linear correlation between hippocampal shape deformations and the serum cortisol levels in MDD patients and healthy subjects.


RESULTS
MDD patients showed significant inward deformations predominantly in the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 and subiculum in bilateral hippocampi compared to healthy subjects (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected, P < .05). Furthermore, in MDD patients, a significant linear correlation between inward deformations and high cortisol levels were found predominantly in the CA1 and subiculum, extending into the CA2-3 (FDR-corrected, P < .05), whereas no significant linear correlation was observed in healthy subjects.

Chiarella, MD; Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL. RATIONALE: The transmembrane protein 178 (Tmem178) is a novel negative regulator of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFAT1c); a recognized player in asthma pathogenesis. Our group has previously shown that changes in TMEM178 gene expression are associated with lower airway obstruction in asthmatics having an acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbation. We sought to compare the relative gene expression of TMEM178 in the airway epithelium of severe asthmatics to that in the airway epithelium of non-severe asthmatics and healthy controls. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of two high-quality publicly available microarray datasets (National Center for Biotechnology Informationâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus database; accession numbers GSE43696 andGSE63142), which contained epithelial brushings obtained by bronchoscopy from asthmatics and healthy donors. For differential gene expression comparisons, moderated Benjamini-Hochberg t-tests (with false discovery rate adjustments) and Dunnâ€™s multiple comparison tests were used. RESULTS: In the first microarray study (GSE43696), severe asthmatics had significantly lower levels of TMEM178 gene expression when compared to moderate asthmatics (p-value <0.05) and healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). Similarly, in the second microarray study (GSE63142), severe asthmatics had significantly lower levels of TMEM178 gene expression when compared to non-severe asthmatics (pvalue <0.001) and healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). Overall, TMEM178 gene expression negatively correlates with asthma severity. CONCLUSIONS: In two independent microarray studies, the relative gene expression of TMEM178 decreased with the progression of asthma severity. We speculate that Tmem178 may play an important role in the regulation of NFAT-induced inflammation in severe asthmatics.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gopal Krishna Dhondalay"", ids = ""49686812""); list(name = ""Bryan J Bunning"", ids = ""11336198""); list(name = ""Kari Christine Nadeau"", ids = ""1984083""); list(name = ""Sandra Andorf"", ids = ""38170019"")",,,The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,143,AB203

We injected PCP to Wistar rats and isolated five different parts of the brain in 1 and 4â€‰hr after the injection. We analyzed the gene expression induced by the PCP treatment of these tissues using the AGILENT rat cDNA microarray system. We observed changes in expression level in 90 genes and 21 ESTs after the treatment. Out of the 10 genes showing >2-fold expressional change evaluated by qRT-PCR, we selected 7 genes as subjects for the locus-wide association study to identify susceptibility genes for schizophrenia in the Japanese population. In haplotype analysis, significant associations were detected in combinations of two SNPs of BTG2 (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-6) ), PDE4A (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-6) ), and PLAT (Pâ€‰=â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-3) ), after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Additionally, we not only successfully replicated the haplotype associations in PDE4A (Pâ€‰=â€‰6.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10(-12) ) and PLAT (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.015), but also detected single-point associations of one SNP in PDE4A (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0068) and two SNPs in PLAT (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0260 and 0.0104) in another larger sample set consisting of 2,224 cases and 2,250 controls.

9c2832c1642cf908024e024ed2d0ce15b1332dca,Sensitive and highly resolved identification of RNA-protein interaction sites in PAR-CLIP data,"BackgroundPAR-CLIP is a recently developed Next Generation Sequencing-based method enabling transcriptome-wide identification of interaction sites between RNA and RNA-binding proteins. The PAR-CLIP procedure induces specific base transitions that originate from sites of RNA-protein interactions and can therefore guide the identification of binding sites. However, additional sources of transitions, such as cell type-specific SNPs and sequencing errors, challenge the inference of binding sites and suitable statistical approaches are crucial to control false discovery rates. In addition, a highly resolved delineation of binding sites followed by an extensive downstream analysis is necessary for a comprehensive characterization of the protein binding preferences and the subsequent design of validation experiments.ResultsWe present a statistical and computational framework for PAR-CLIP data analysis. We developed a sensitive transition-centered algorithm specifically designed to resolve protein binding sites at high resolution in PAR-CLIP data. Our method employes a Bayesian network approach to associate posterior log-odds with the observed transitions, providing an overall quantification of the confidence in RNA-protein interaction. We use published PAR-CLIP data to demonstrate the advantages of our approach, which compares favorably with alternative algorithms. Lastly, by integrating RNA-Seq data we compute conservative experimentally-based false discovery rates of our method and demonstrate the high precision of our strategy.ConclusionsOur method is implemented in the R package wavClusteR 2.0.

89547fb5e8e18860e2e65a2b9573b562d376ca3b,Patterns of Eye Movement Impairment Correlate with Regional Brain Atrophy in Neurodegenerative Parkinsonism,"Background: One common feature of neurodegenerative parkinsonism including Parkinson's disease (PD), multisystem atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is altered eye movement control. Characteristic regional structural atrophy patterns in MRI can be observed in PD, MSA, and PSP. Objective: To investigate the association between eye movement disturbances and regional brain atrophy in patients with PD, MSA, and PSP. Methods: High-resolution 3-dimensional T1-weighted MRI images and video-oculographic recordings (EyeLinkÂ®) were obtained from 39 PD, 32 PSP, and 18 MSA patients and 24 matched healthy control subjects. Automatic regional volumetric assessment was performed using atlas-based volumetry (ABV). Results: The prevalence of saccadic intrusions as a measure of inhibitory control was significantly increased in PD patients compared to controls (p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with whole brain volume, cerebral brain volume, and occipital lobe volume (p = 0.0057, p = 0.0049, and p = 0.0059, respectively; all p values are false discovery rate corrected). In MSA, smooth pursuit was disturbed by characteristic â€œcatch-upâ€ saccades (p < 0.001) and it was significantly correlated with cerebellar volume (p = 0.004) and pontine volume (p < 0.001). The hallmark of PSP was pathologically slowed vertical peak eye velocities (p < 0.001); the lower the peak eye velocity, the more marked midbrain atrophy (p = 0.007). Conclusions: Foci of regional atrophy correlated with disease-specific eye movement alterations in all investigated parkinsonian syndromes.

Site-selective imaging can provide significant insight into the mechanism of HIV-associated neurological disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate the involvement of serotonergic transmission in HIV-associated depression using [(11)C]DASB, a serotonin transporter (5-HTT)-specific radiopharmaceutical for positron emission tomography (PET).


METHODS
Nine depressed HIV+ subjects (HIV-D), 9 non-depressed HIV+ subjects (HIV-ND) and 7 healthy controls (HC) underwent an MRI scan and a [(11)C]DASB-PET scan. The outcome measure was 5-HTT binding potential normalized to non-displaceable tissue radioligand (BP(ND)).


RESULTS
HIV-ND subjects had lower mean regional 5-HTT BP(ND) estimates across regions compared to HC, while HIV-D subjects demonstrated higher mean regional binding values than HIV-ND subjects in most regions. Prior to correction for the false discovery rate, HIV-ND had significantly lower BP(ND) values compared to HC subjects in two regions (insula and anterior cingulate) and all HIV+ patients had significantly lower binding than HC in all regions except for the midbrain, thalamus and pons. After correction for the false discovery rate, only the insula showed significantly lower binding in HIV+ subjects compared to HC (P<0.0045). Despite a significant difference in the duration of illness between the HIV-D and HIV-ND groups, there was no definite correlation between the duration of illness and BP(ND).


CONCLUSION
Lower [(11)C]DASB binding in HIV+ patients compared to HC may reflect serotonergic neuronal loss as a component of generalized HIV-associated neurodegeneration. Higher mean regional BP(ND) values in HIV-D compared to HIV-ND subjects could reflect increased density of 5-HTT, leading to increased clearance of serotonin from the synapse, which could account, in part, for symptoms of depression. The lack of correlation between duration of illness and binding argues against these findings being the result of differential neurodegeneration only. Our findings suggest a possible role for dysregulated serotonergic transmission in HIV-associated depression.",2010,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dima A.

830196f508f229041d971f7bd553d8f0f65fc560,Application of a Bayesian deconvolution approach for high-resolution (1)H NMR spectra to assessing the metabolic effects of acute phenobarbital exposure in liver tissue.,"High-resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy is frequently used in the field of metabolomics to assess the metabolites found in biofluids or tissue extracts to define a metabolic profile that describes a given biological process. In this study, we aimed to increase the utility of NMR-based metabolomics by using advanced Bayesian modeling of the time-domain high-resolution 1D NMR free induction decay (FID). The improvement over traditional nonparametric binning is twofold and associated with enhanced resolution of the analysis and automation of the signal processing stage. The automation is achieved by using a Bayesian formalism for all parameters of the model including the number of components. The approach is illustrated with a study of early markers of acute exposure to different doses of a well-characterized nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogen, phenobarbital, in rats. The results demonstrate that Bayesian deconvolution produces a better model for the NMR spectra that allows the identification of subtle changes in metabolic concentrations and a decrease in the expected false discovery rate compared with approaches based on ""binning"". These properties suggest that Bayesian deconvolution could facilitate the biomarker discovery process and improve information extraction from high-resolution NMR spectra.",2010,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Denis V.

ad88bce470644c6e36c69f8e5d65866c636d83a9,Body mass index is associated with cortical thinning with different patterns in mid- and late-life,"Objective:High BMI at midlife is associated with increased risk of dementia as well as faster decline in cognitive function. In late-life, however, high BMI has been found to be associated with both increased and decreased dementia risk. The objective of this study was to investigate the neural substrates of this age-related change in body mass index (BMI) risk.Methods:We measured longitudinal cortical thinning over the whole brain, based on magnetic resonance imaging scans for 910 individuals aged 44â€“66 years at baseline. Subjects were sampled from a large population study (PATH, Personality and Total Health through Life). After attrition and exclusions, the final analysis was based on 792 individuals, including 387 individuals aged 60â€“66 years and 405 individuals aged 44â€“49 years. A mixed-effects model was used to test the association between cortical thinning and baseline BMI, as well as percentage change in BMI.Results:Increasing BMI was associated with increased cortical thinning in posterior cingulate at midlife (0.014â€‰mmâ€‰kgâˆ’1â€‰mâˆ’2, confidence interval; CI=0.005, 0.023, P<0.05 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). In late-life, increasing BMI was associated with reduced cortical thickness, most prominently in the right supramarginal cortex (0.010â€‰mmâ€‰kgâˆ’1â€‰mâˆ’2, CI=0.005â€“0.016, P<0.05 FDR corrected), as well as frontal regions. In late-life, decreasing BMI was also associated with increased cortical thinning, including right caudal middle frontal cortex (0.014â€‰mmâ€‰kgâˆ’1â€‰mâˆ’2 (CI=0.006â€“0.023, P<0.05 FDR corrected).Conclusions:The pattern of cortical thinningâ€”in association with increasing BMI at both midlife and late-lifeâ€”is consistent with known obesity-related dementia risk.

56c0fafd5311f59dfce1049d3222a0f040591818,Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression of E14 Versus E18 Fetal Fibroblasts.,"Objective: Fetuses early in gestation heal skin wounds without forming scars. The biological mechanisms behind this process are largely unknown. Fibroblasts, however, are cells known to be intimately involved in wound healing and scar formation. We examined fibroblasts in different stages of development to characterize differences in gene expression that may result in the switch from regenerative wound repair to repair with scarring. Approach: Fibroblasts were isolated and cultured from the back skin of BALB/c wild-type mouse fetuses at embryonic day (E)14 and E18 (nâ€‰=â€‰10). The fibroblast total RNA was extracted, and microarray analysis was conducted using chips containing 42,000 genes. Significance analysis of microarrays was performed to identify genes with greater than twofold expression difference and a false discovery rate of less than two. Identified genes subsequently underwent enrichment analysis to detect differentially expressed pathways. Results: Two hundred seventy-five genes were differentially expressed between E14 and E18 in fetal fibroblasts. Thirty genes were significantly downregulated and 245 genes were significantly upregulated at E18 compared with E14. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified the top 20 signaling pathways differentially activated in fetal fibroblasts between the E18 and E14 time points. Innovation: To our knowledge, this work represents the first instance where differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways between fetal fibroblasts at E14 and E18 have been studied. Conclusion: The genes and pathways identified here potentially underlie the mechanism behind the transition from fetal wound healing via regeneration to wound healing by repair, and may prove to be key targets for future therapeutics.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael S Hu"", ids = ""6265041""); list(name = ""Mimi R.

94fb8da008163280810afd74085b22665865b5f8,Lysosomal inhibition attenuates peroxisomal gene transcription via suppression of PPARA and PPARGC1A levels.,"Lysosomes influence dynamic cellular processes such as nutrient sensing and transcriptional regulation. To explore novel transcriptional pathways regulated by lysosomes, we performed microarray analysis followed by qPCR validation in a mouse hepatocyte cell line, AML12, treated with bafilomycin A1 (lysosomal v-type H+-translocating ATPase inhibitor). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant downregulation of gene sets related to peroxisomal biogenesis and peroxisomal lipid oxidation upon lysosomal inhibition. Mechanistically, pharmacological inhibition of lysosomes as well as genetic knockdown of Tfeb led to downregulation of the peroxisomal master regulator PPARA and its coactivator PPARGC1A/PGC1Î±. Consistently, ectopic induction of PPARA transcriptional activity rescues the effects of lysosomal inhibition on peroxisomal gene expression. Collectively, our results uncover a novel metabolic regulation of peroxisomes by lysosomes via PPARA-PPARGC1A transcriptional signalling.

945d533edb5bcd04799461d0e1369f27b2741959,Importance of substantial weight loss for altering gene expression during cardiovascular lifestyle modification.,"OBJECTIVE
To examine relationships between weight loss through changes in lifestyle and peripheral blood gene expression profiles.


METHODS
A prospective nonrandomized trial was conducted over 1 year in participants undergoing intensive lifestyle modification to reverse or stabilize progression of coronary artery disease. Cardiovascular risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and gene expression as a function of weight loss were assessed in 89 lifestyle participants and 71 retrospectively matched controls undergoing usual care.


RESULTS
Substantial weight loss (-15.2â€‰Â±â€‰3.8%) in lifestyle participants (nâ€‰=â€‰33) was associated with improvement in selected cardiovascular risk factors and significant changes in peripheral blood gene expression from pre- to post-intervention: 132 unique genes showed significant expression changes (false discovery rate corrected P-value <0.05 and fold-change â‰¥1.4). Altered molecular pathways were related to immune function and inflammatory responses involving endothelial activation. In contrast, participants losing minimal weight (-3.1â€‰Â±â€‰2.5%, nâ€‰=â€‰32) showed only minor changes in cardiovascular risk factors and markers of inflammation and no changes in gene expression compared to non intervention controls after 1 year.


CONCLUSIONS
Weight loss (â‰¥10%) during lifestyle modification is associated with down-regulation of genetic pathways governing interactions between circulating immune cells and the vascular endothelium and may be required to successfully reduce CVD risk.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Darrell L Ellsworth"", ids = ""3617281""); list(name = ""Kimberly A.

163b04e1d06105f4a660f723915c959c9b0040dd,High-Dimensional Inference for Cluster-Based Graphical Models,"Motivated by modern applications in which one constructs graphical models based on a very large number of features, this paper introduces a new class of cluster-based graphical models. Unlike standard graphical models, variable clustering is applied as an initial step for reducing the dimension of the feature space. We employ model assisted clustering, in which the clusters contain features that are similar to the same unobserved latent variable. Two different cluster-based Gaussian graphical models are considered: the latent variable graph, corresponding to the graphical model associated with the unobserved latent variables, and the cluster-average graph, corresponding to the vector of features averaged over clusters. We derive estimates tailored to these graphs, with the goal of pattern recovery under false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our study reveals that likelihood based inference for the latent graph is analytically intractable, and we develop alternative estimation and inference strategies. We replace the likelihood of the data by appropriate empirical risk functions that allow for valid inference in both graphical models under study. Our main results are Berry-Esseen central limit theorems for the proposed estimators, which are proved under weaker assumptions than those employed in the existing literature on Gaussian graphical model inference. We make explicit the implications of the asymptotic approximations on graph recovery under FDR control, and show when it can be controlled asymptotically. Our analysis takes into account the uncertainty induced by the initial clustering step. We find that the errors induced by clustering are asymptotically ignorable in the follow-up analysis, under no further restrictions on the parameter space for which inference is valid.

By taking into consideration of the correlation of signals received by antennae which compose the antenna array, we could improve greatly the discovery probability of signal coefficients in time-frequency domain through taking advantage of the method of integration for signal detection. Meanwhile, under the assumption of Gaussian noise environment, the probability density functions of noise and signal after integration were also presented. In order to extract the coefficients for signal and reduce the Type I error further, an algorithm based False Discovery Rate (FDR) was put forward. Finally, a comparison between the detection performances before and after integration was made: under same rate of Type I error, the detection performance of signal after integration is improved significantly. And the effectiveness of the method was showed by experimental results as well.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yan Shang"", ids = ""1689468"")",,8cc9918add61ee5ef3b848aba9646169cc5e364e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 84448eceabe055f28ce3c0d74c4fb8447730485f; 37832b76ed477e0aff7a66afae54a55c6d1455fa,Applied Mechanics and Materials,148-149,309 - 312

After a rejection, it will often be of interest to identify which series can be deemed to be stationary and which series can be deemed nonstationary. Researchers will sometimes carry out this classification on the basis of n individual (univariate) unit root tests based on some ad hoc significance level.

216f0709d3ad237819bc9b68f196c7ee0c6703a0,Epistemological issues in omics and high-dimensional biology: give the people what they want.,"Gene expression microarrays have been the vanguard of new analytic approaches in high-dimensional biology. Draft sequences of several genomes coupled with new technologies allow study of the influences and responses of entire genomes rather than isolated genes. This has opened a new realm of highly dimensional biology where questions involve multiplicity at unprecedented scales: thousands of genetic polymorphisms, gene expression levels, protein measurements, genetic sequences, or any combination of these and their interactions. Such situations demand creative approaches to the processes of inference, estimation, prediction, classification, and study design. Although bench scientists intuitively grasp the need for flexibility in the inferential process, the elaboration of formal supporting statistical frameworks is just at the very start. Here, we will discuss some of the unique statistical challenges facing investigators studying high-dimensional biology, describe some approaches being developed by statistical scientists, and offer an epistemological framework for the validation of proffered statistical procedures. A key theme will be the challenge in providing methods that a statistician judges to be sound and a biologist finds informative. The shift from family-wise error rate control to false discovery rate estimation and to assessment of ranking and other forms of stability will be portrayed as illustrative of approaches to this challenge.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tapan Mehta"", ids = ""144878168""); list(name = ""Stanislav O.

37dba08f99c59628430b2d34c52ba00d639faf4c,Early Detection of Pharmacovigilance Signals with Automated Methods Based on False Discovery Rates,"AbstractBackground: Improving the detection of drug safety signals has led several pharmacovigilance regulatory agencies to incorporate automated quantitative methods into their spontaneous reporting management systems. The three largest worldwide pharmacovigilance databases are routinely screened by the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of proportional reporting ratio (PRR02.5), the 2.5% quantile of the Information Component (IC02.5) or the 5% quantile of the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS05). More recently, Bayesian and non-Bayesian False Discovery Rate (FDR)-based methods were proposed that address the arbitrariness of thresholds and allow for a built-in estimate of the FDR. These methods were also shown through simulation studies to be interesting alternatives to the currently used methods.
 Objective: The objective of this work was twofold. Based on an extensive retrospective study, we compared PRR02.5, GPS05 and IC02.5 with two FDR-based methods derived from the Fisherâ€™s exact test and the GPS model (GPSpH0 [posterior probability of the null hypothesis H0 calculated from the Gamma Poisson Shrinker model]). Secondly, restricting the analysis to GPSpH0, we aimed to evaluate the added value of using automated signal detection tools compared with â€˜traditionalâ€™ methods, i.e. non-automated surveillance operated by pharmacovigilance experts.
 Methods: The analysis was performed sequentially, i.e. every month, and retrospectively on the whole French pharmacovigilance database over the period 1 January 1996â€“1 July 2002. Evaluation was based on a list of 243 reference signals (RSs) corresponding to investigations launched by the French Pharmacovigilance Technical Committee (PhVTC) during the same period. The comparison of detection methods was made on the basis of the number of RSs detected as well as the time to detection.
 Results: Results comparing the five automated quantitative methods were in favour of GPSpH0 in terms of both number of detections of true signals and time to detection. Additionally, based on an FDR threshold of 5%, GPSpH0 detected 87% of the RSs associated with more than three reports, anticipating the date of investigation by the PhVTC by 15.8 months on average.
 Conclusions: Our results show that as soon as there is reasonable support for the data, automated signal detection tools are powerful tools to explore large spontaneous reporting system databases and detect relevant signals quickly compared with traditional pharmacovigilance methods.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""IsmaÃ¯l Ahmed"", ids = ""2802717""); list(name = ""Frantz Thiessard"", ids = ""2188028""); list(name = ""Ghada Miremont-SalamÃ©"", ids = ""1398125379""); list(name = ""FranÃ§oise Haramburu"", ids = ""5065158""); list(name = ""Carmen Kreft-Jais"", ids = ""1402297008""); list(name = ""Bernard BÃ©gaud"", ids = ""3050322""); list(name = ""Pascale Tubert-Bitter"", ids = ""1398734189"")",a3dc35910c15415c5518174f3e8b8389d2fd5044; eb289c307860cc4e608b0064c024827a31d52d5f; 40bdecfd8cfd6c748482102a95529863551dfa30; 157e5e773bdb9c2d504a3a357208d236fcfada87; 23a1ec9580b36b842e7d240aa05a6c8ce28e07be; 7419376551c20fc88f524cb08e32aff7d348b90f; 793eed964990103c31d0b079c41dd37d7af2b5f2; ba8c057a76e6259b7e0de17a135c428ebea2b4b7; e868059516c707ea8701d3e1e88999daab0def31; 7e2a46a2b377e31c28776fe09e0089ba396db01d; 47a1c08cbb8b572e67221410ab64484e88c0a565; 39c094d1ea1065f9ea146fcc5b3dd640350d7fb2; 9cf4d559c6845737266a00290d3d0dcd5e61ac2d; 482f1f5daf61ba1cd97a958c6b2e5a35ddb5708e; dd7bfa6efeb4d8a85971af7dc31e8ace434729c8,,Drug Safety,35,495-506
24806e79df7f8b4f8f18998bbf7705895f83cdee,Improved accuracy of lesion to symptom mapping with multivariate sparse canonical correlations,"ABSTRACT Lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool for understanding the causality of brainâ€behavior relationships. The analyses are typically performed by applying statistical methods on individual brain voxels (VLSM), a method called the massâ€univariate approach. Several authors have shown that VLSM suffers from limitations that may decrease the accuracy and reliability of the findings, and have proposed the use of multivariate methods to overcome these limitations. In this study, we propose a multivariate optimization technique known as sparse canonical correlation analysis for neuroimaging (SCCAN) for lesion to symptom mapping. To validate the method and compare it with massâ€univariate results, we used data from 131 patients with chronic stroke lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, and created synthetic behavioral scores based on the lesion load of 93 brain regions (putative functional units). LSM analyses were performed with univariate VLSM or SCCAN, and the accuracy of the two methods was compared in terms of both overlap and displacement from the simulated functional areas. Overall, SCCAN produced more accurate results â€ higher dice overlap and smaller average displacement â€ compared to VLSM. This advantage persisted at different sample sizes (N = 20â€“131) and different multiple comparison corrections (false discovery rate, FDR; Bonferroni; permutationâ€based family wise error rate, FWER). These findings were replicated with a fully automated SCCAN routine that relied on crossâ€validated predictive accuracy to find the optimal sparseness value. Simulations of one, two, and three brain regions showed a systematic advantage of SCCAN over VLSM; under no circumstance could VLSM exceed the accuracy obtained with SCCAN. When considering functional units composed of multiple brain areas VLSM identified fewer areas than SCCAN. The investigation of real scores of aphasia severity (aphasia quotient and picture naming) showed that SCCAN could accurately identify known languageâ€critical areas, while VLSM either produced diffuse maps (FDR correction) or few scattered voxels (FWER correction). Overall, this study shows that a multivariate method, such as, SCCAN, outperforms VLSM in a number of scenarios, including functional dependency on single or multiple areas, different sample sizes, different multiâ€area combinations, and different thresholding mechanisms (FWER, Bonferroni, FDR). These results support previous claims that multivariate methods are in general more accurate than massâ€univariate approaches, and should be preferred over traditional VLSM approaches. All the methods described in this study are available in the newly developed LESYMAP package for R. HIGHLIGHTSVoxelâ€based lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) suffers from poor accuracy.We propose a novel multivariate LSM method based on canonical correlations.Univariate and multivariate methods were compared in simulated and real analyses.The multivariate method exceeded systematically the accuracy of traditional VLSM.The new method is implemented in the LESYMAP package for R.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dorian Pustina"", ids = ""3698765""); list(name = ""Brian B.

27277000a12a51c902e2a802932128783fda7339,"Mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters: gender differences in factors associated with parent-child communication about sexual topics","BackgroundIn the United States, nearly half of high school students are sexually active, and adolescents experience high rates of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Parents can have an important influence on their children's sexual behaviour, but many parents do not talk with their children about sexual topics. Research has shown significant differences in parent-child communication about sexual topics depending on the gender of both the parent and the child. Little is known, however, about the reasons for these gender differences. The purpose of this paper is to describe how factors associated with parent-child communication about sexual topics differ by gender.MethodsData are from a nationwide online survey with 829 fathers and 1,113 mothers of children aged 10 to 14. For each of the four gender groups (fathers of sons, fathers of daughters, mothers of sons, mothers of daughters), we calculated the distribution of responses to questions assessing (1) parent-child communication about sex-related topics, and (2) factors associated with that communication. We used chi-square tests to determine whether the distributions differed and the false discovery rate control to reduce the likelihood of type I errors.ResultsWith both sons and daughters, fathers communicated less about sexual topics than mothers did. Fathers also had lower levels of many characteristics that facilitate communication about sex (e.g., lower self-efficacy and lower expectations that talking to their children about sex would have positive outcomes). Compared with parents of sons, parents of daughters (both mothers and fathers) talked more about sexual topics, were more concerned about potential harmful consequences of sexual activity, and were more disapproving of their child having sex at an early age.ConclusionsUsing a large national sample, this study confirms findings from previous studies showing gender differences in parent-child communication about sexual topics and identifies gender differences in factors that may influence parent-child communication about sexual topics.

2489e0d6790667ec0a84bdeca348e8df8a908127,Editorial for the special topic on multiple comparison procedures.,"The five papers on the special topic of multiple comparison procedures in this issue were presented at the IXth International Conference on Multiple Comparison Procedures (MCP2015). This conference was held in Hyderabad, India, from September 2 to September 5, 2015. The previous MCP conferences have been held at Tel Aviv (1996), Berlin (2000), Bethesda (2002), Shanghai (2005), Vienna (2007), Tokyo (2009), Washington, D.C. (2011), and Southampton (2013). These conferences provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of advances in the methodology and applications of multiple comparison procedures and adaptive designs. Two highlights of MCP2015 were the keynote speech by Dr. Martin Posch on â€œMultiplicity, Interim Analyses, and Adaptations: Addressing Multiple Objectives in Clinical Trialsâ€ and an invited session on â€œFDA Multiplicity Draft Guidance Documentâ€ led by Dr. John Scott of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) along with three discussants, Drs. Mohammed Huque, Frank Bretz, and Andreas Brandt. The Guidance Document is now released for public comments and has benefitted in part from the discussion. Drs. Franz Koenig and Martin Posch organized two panel sessions on â€œEstimation and Closed Testingâ€ and â€œFrontiers of Confirmatory Inference in Small Populations.â€ There were 20 other invited and contributed sessions. All speakers were invited to submit their papers for publication in this special issue, resulting in 11 papers being submitted. All papers underwent a rigorous review process and five were accepted, which appear in the following pages. Asakura, Hamasaki, and Evans discuss group sequential designs and several decision frameworks to test for superiority or futility when there are multiple coprimary endpoints. Various operating characteristics, such as power and expected sample size are studied via simulation as functions of the correlations among the endpoints, the number of interim analyses, etc. Peng, Liu, Bretz, and Shkedy derive multiple confidence intervals for selected parameters in doseâ€“response microarray experiments when selections are adjusted for false coverage rate. Here, the genes showing monotone doseâ€“responses are selected and comparisons are made between the highest dose and control. Liu, Sivaganesan, Laud, and MÃ¼ller develop a Bayesian approach to subgroup analysis when the covariates defining the subgroups are categorical. Subgroups are represented by a collection of analysis-ofvariance models and the best model is selected by specifying suitable priors on the model space and calculating multiplicity adjusted posteriors. Wang and Cui provide a uniform improvement of Hayterâ€™s modification of the classical Fisherâ€™s least significant difference test. This is done by sharpening the preliminary F-test. Similarly, Solari and Goeman provide a small but uniform improvement of Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s step-up procedure that controls the false discovery rate when testing multiple hypotheses. I wish to express my sincere thanks to the three associate editors, Frank Bretz, Franz Koenig, and Sanat Sarkar and a number of referees, who helped in reviewing the papers. Last but not the least, I thank the Biometrical Journal for publishing papers from past MCP conferences and its current coeditor, Dankmar BÃ¶hning, for his support in bringing out this set of papers.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ajit C.

19924682d35b053385e57f8fcca99b7d6709eaf3,The alterations in inter-hemispheric functional coordination of patients with panic disorder: the findings in the posterior sub-network of default mode network.,"OBJECTIVE
Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) has been studied in several neuropsychiatric illnesses. The inter-hemispheric interactions probably could explain the important aspects for the pathophysiology of panic disorder (PD). Therefore, we initiated this study to estimate the differences in VMHC values between the PD patients and controls.


METHODS
Thirty first-episode medication-naÃ¯ve patients with PD and 21 controls were enrolled with age and gender controlled. All the participants received the scanning of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-FMRI). The R-FMRI images were preprocessed and analyzed to obtain the VMHC values. The two-sample t test of VMHC data between PD patients and controls was performed. We also explored the relationship between the VMHC values and clinical characteristics.


RESULTS
The controls had significantly higher VMHC values than patients in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (false discovery rate corrected p<0.005). The one-sided results by the unilateral hemisphere mask also confirmed that the results were indeed found in the right hemisphere. The VMHC value in the posterior cingulate cortex was also negatively correlated with panic severity.


CONCLUSION
The alterations of inter-hemispheric coordination in cingulate-precuneus may play a role in the pathophysiology of PD.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chien-Han Lai"", ids = ""123069030""); list(name = ""Yu-Te Wu"", ids = ""2299843"")",623b189e8d55785c855c27a2daa735cd5c48df8b; 57dcc3522cb0650367fc05ccfad7f5970ae785f5; f7230c2dcf8cbb2bbee47dd5f039da0b3e36205a; 03ce1b01f7c2100f03e7b250e2284aac7f9097ea; 3df2b7c5a3ceeee00bd86f86ec5560bb0b742784; eb16954ad225b2b507c9796912ec9e89c33eb9df; 5c8b8a298075384e1c7498d52978a5c8dc050d50; 72b06978eb5d894778c2d532469602c7fff17a81,,Journal of affective disorders,166,"

90a2a38c1ee085e3814f80df618e56ea71f033f9,Apparently low reproducibility of true differential expression discoveries in microarray studies,"MOTIVATION
Differentially expressed gene (DEG) lists detected from different microarray studies for a same disease are often highly inconsistent. Even in technical replicate tests using identical samples, DEG detection still shows very low reproducibility. It is often believed that current small microarray studies will largely introduce false discoveries.


RESULTS
Based on a statistical model, we show that even in technical replicate tests using identical samples, it is highly likely that the selected DEG lists will be very inconsistent in the presence of small measurement variations. Therefore, the apparently low reproducibility of DEG detection from current technical replicate tests does not indicate low quality of microarray technology. We also demonstrate that heterogeneous biological variations existing in real cancer data will further reduce the overall reproducibility of DEG detection. Nevertheless, in small subsamples from both simulated and real data, the actual false discovery rate (FDR) for each DEG list tends to be low, suggesting that each separately determined list may comprise mostly true DEGs. Rather than simply counting the overlaps of the discovery lists from different studies for a complex disease, novel metrics are needed for evaluating the reproducibility of discoveries characterized with correlated molecular changes.

bfe1873644857d790c1acc2deaf9181b9744ec47,Association of candidate gene polymorphisms with chronic kidney disease in Japanese individuals with hypertension,"Although hypertension has been recognized as a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), the genetic factors for predisposition to CKD in individuals with hypertension remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic variants that confer susceptibility to CKD among individuals with hypertension. The study population comprised 3696 Japanese individuals with hypertension (2265 men, 1431 women), including 1257 individuals (789 men, 468 women) with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60â€‰mlâ€‰minâˆ’1 per 1.73â€‰m2) and 2439 controls (1476 men, 963 women; eGFRâ©¾60â€‰mlâ€‰minâˆ’1 per 1.73â€‰m2). The genotypes for 30 polymorphisms of 26 candidate genes were determined. An initial screening of allele frequencies by the Ï‡2-test revealed that eight polymorphisms were significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) associated with the prevalence of CKD in hypertensive individuals. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates as well as a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that the T â†’ C (Val591Ala) polymorphism of APOB (rs679899), the âˆ’681C â†’ G polymorphism of PPARG (rs10865710), the T â†’ C (Cys1367Arg) polymorphism of WRN (rs1346044), the âˆ’850C â†’ T polymorphism of TNF (rs1799724), the âˆ’219G â†’ T polymorphism of APOE (rs405509), the C â†’ T polymorphism of PTGS1 (rs883484) and the 41A â†’ G (Glu14Gly) polymorphism of ACAT2 (rs9658625) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with the prevalence of CKD. Our results suggest that APOB, WRN, ACAT2, APOE, PPARG, TNF and PTGS1 are susceptibility loci for CKD among Japanese individuals with hypertension. Determination of the genotypes for these polymorphisms may prove informative for the assessment of genetic risk for CKD among such individuals.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yutaka Nishigaki"", ids = ""6466382""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",9c0ec2d0f61570febdbede1347fb04f0f9963347; 3c0949d50137b5aebc8e8098b6056440db48395d; a5665f6769efca9ad5482be37e48f3d6d5c02ad4; 5230511f02af8d44a51ff31a42b47401f378c84e; 0ad95f279405f69cf27441fe57b0214fa1638ae0; 00f7eadf3e681762510511799efa8dcce32c5cbc; a5d3c0da047d76170ecf5dc82c1452244bf98c8e; 685e9ecb362a44d67deeb870a5adc080fa20456a; 8b5e6cc2b9042f1bded101d21839e1574a773845; 41a4ffe84a3d8ca4d57a7c4396848893d883478e; f7f0fa847b5b8d948eda8219350057c8ceb55c9b; cbb275e5e67e0137044e383e685cbcf8ca7e0d15; e6b3e22ea28af927ab411e2279ce0f760b831d4b,dc987babbbfcc8252df8c00012a4cbba2a0ff855; 87b1b26afdd1602e771ed72954d0695ed15359fe; 7d3feac736d01acd686183f71a1d208b90d07954; faf75caad06b7ec848c645d51b4bb2e22d3ef7ba; dbc55bb353065a0a695fd783288337ba81ecbb8d; de272c5b61f8c4865f1a6e89c20ed555efacff00; baaba9c84d6796325dfd6c9af38fb6e86fe300a8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d8dea0d2e01c9c84c463e65d1ef3f061d5607d93; eb17e368f3e7d6059fbfb22c71adbd775785cab0; cb5bf46a288d4bd5fb22b900e0617789b2037d5d; 043953b1538c88fe27b566fdfafb29da308b8bd7; 57755e403dba5ecc0aa561f67105266989cfa228; 7fab9ddecb4f2a99141a5fc172ddeaf59637f70b; be721dc8286835d513a14073dada7e76cd06ace8; 31a25965e554c9284f5cc35cdb22aea4d8fad953; 1327a7a137c02a8c0fee59d30f783989a9f36615; f643e33fe0e2e2007222c572ddfdb9ef8078edae; 836bf9b9544e0f94697c095f17086faa39514ca5; e4d52032e7966701cd12fc90778403887c8c13fe; 4af2102c02467a5204972a64b6273f5dbd2ebe55; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; 364744afe3e09b8a5907e41849c4303e892b8ac3; 4184cb98262fc369429342bcff41294e227e9cbf; e8412cc9d1d7709aa6e96b99c867882017dca247; 1b25de7fcf28c7cf0715037a7f189fe37b439bde; 75d3451d031c5923c55dacf53ce59be20df4dd4a; a4124e219c4ff01f45a0e665794d44cb568a155f,Hypertension Research,32,411-418
062036650c79afc5ada978a3859a6582804039d8,Genetic and environmental influences on DNA methylation,"Background: The association of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and DNA methylation has been studied predominantly at regulatory regions of imprinted genes and at just thousands of the ~28 million CpG sites in the human genome. Methods: We investigated the links between IVF and DNA methylation patterns in whole cord blood cells (n = 98) and cord blood mononuclear cells (n = 82) from newborn twins using genome-wide methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing. Results: At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified one significant whole blood DNA methylation change linked to conception via IVF, which was located ~3 kb upstream of TNP1, a gene previously linked to male infertility. The 46 most strongly associated signals (FDR of 25%) included a second region in a gene also previously linked to infertility, C9orf3, suggesting that our findings may in part capture the effect of parental subfertility. Using twin modelling, we observed that individual-specific environmental factors appear to be the main overall contributors of methylation variability at the FDR 25% IVF-associated differentially methylated regions, although evidence for methylation heritability was also obtained at several of these regions. We replicated previous findings of differential methylation associated with IVF at the H19/IGF2 region in cord blood mononuclear cells, and we validated the signal at C9orf3 in monozygotic twins. We also explored the impact of intracytoplasmic sperm injection on the FDR 25% signals for potential effects specific to male or female infertility factors. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation profiles at birth and IVF conception to date, and our results show evidence for epigenetic modifications that may in part reflect parental subfertility.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Juan E Castillo-Fernandez"", ids = ""1404099449"")",,d4ec14e8389e82cfa3efc3803251bbae420a00a4; 38375748e7568fd16a9ffc634aa84f5a4e88a4f3; 29649d23d8b6835143867e9b9269c4603672aabb; ba1c7eb3db556352a2494a78761d33fdde32b7dd; 1cb89b39f8b6143e2d801ff2aff9afe14ec0dd1e; ef64f1113c0cd2b70e550120a6f41a11a6265c52; 1a854842f18c5e8ba68f22b3bc24991a380f1c10; 187269168d8f0eac228199e522ca909a8992654d; 325819bf6441788a0776f2e8033b07f1c66199a4; 6d1db98469bfdf2cbb1f3613efd620bf8e8ed1b1; bbcd6e2fe6ad3f70e1c5fa828153348ac583276e; 841bac75604889ece963e27b4e0fb344349937bd; 634a1a739c529e192b5c125832bd08c469989bb6; 926056885d99cb19df9d5957a4f46f8a5601c524; 3beec225f60688e1e032c5fd44876efaea352b1a; 831cdc7deb26fbddda14d52f4b311b5226877812; b4f249781ae06568c7e1d41c357c27a78f5d2dbc; 1e3cb4ff319a3e6edfa229ec7d39928e6b3522d5; aa66ee9d3296f4a4c11dc7b7cb7a36fd8b43fa84; 901b0eed9c7b24d1738ffa8bf46795c6a785fb78; e7d49efd42586a4f019c72e46d84aa2f5cfc6392; 4e8847acc125e6b4b42227cdd240d02fffe90e7b; 9b536c7b0f45d4b512f337d0acda09ca3e4cd953; 1810fc1915a6a9b851d4b631c8ead44b613bd747; 59419d6c818f97000efc1c68eadc4f38b26007d6; a75c82a8786595cb6c6c2b2c402d849016959153; fc3fa5878b37ffb8c05212c95ed6983978ef771e; 8c32c52ac9bbcdab8a75172a567429727a5dad83; fe0c2a5e30c8656cf713a0f31d1ba942077cbafa; f2e8782e6b0b18f0769d005e1d9463aba33ad261; 745afc1eaf3ab256c2a6d945aaa6135cff013093; 5120b36657cd90842cfb2c8f24ed8d337370c35d; 17bff39cdf2dd0a72bc31f27dbe2595f2bf211de; bc1535789ade970cb77969824c1bb9a7e8fb2e8c; 8710c0118a1dbd7c2d89af66095a46d11b1e3f66; 2226f9be7bbded62cee8a88ca5cb7e2c5eab3dc3; 5da7c020f5cb7f4775abdf9de30dc3a7ec9ea1bd; ad032c039418ccfa07a9e3449a4007a6781c554a; 5e4ea4c6265adbecce41b32d3211ea5059c00476; b86d7c1cdc1533182fd76eb45af1e0dc5d081dac; b086b129cbd60a5839f9743eed9d739ce480bd24; 87012b02f18bb6a7ac33783e05132bdf88634c18; e9c47efee39397d5f1d4d4059c864c44fca004cb; ae8b2ebc220225bf950762eda75fd48c23bbbb47; f23f569d19db5054f4890a18d365c7d16ecff1a6; b81bb3950bbbe2bd91aa003f00e55c4929a5f42e; 73061c8a47871944daf7519065930112e06d98e5; f8870106a603bf14507295b75b59c18cc17299a2; 872a1bdcbea71813ada71771385c40a90bf91136; 8cbcdf14f1e8894abf80b9f4db7afd7d860f55ca; 5458639863473f00bed743167c44de6b64733e09; df76816262122284a16496b634d565622cb22c0a; d3baf15176a33109a15f91c3b47dc579b4daa4b1; ed50f2a8d5ffcb1b7b471d6a8c9f654384eeeeb6; 30fdefc9f8984b37c54b62ecd8318226c482379e; 0fd7e121d8fdb26f9fe69cf2daee4822381e8b07; 93d8c23e7bf513a7445a79edc5e6499dd3782464,,,
d8eade3da507e2a0341998da4d510652f299e0fa,Adaptive Monte Carlo Multiple Testing via Multi-Armed Bandits,"Monte Carlo (MC) permutation test is considered the gold standard for statistical hypothesis testing, especially when standard parametric assumptions are not clear or likely to fail. However, in modern data science settings where a large number of hypothesis tests need to be performed simultaneously, it is rarely used due to its prohibitive computational cost. In genome-wide association studies, for example, the number of hypothesis tests $m$ is around $10^6$ while the number of MC samples $n$ for each test could be greater than $10^8$, totaling more than $nm$=$10^{14}$ samples. In this paper, we propose Adaptive MC multiple Testing (AMT) to estimate MC p-values and control false discovery rate in multiple testing. The algorithm outputs the same result as the standard full MC approach with high probability while requiring only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}m)$ samples. This sample complexity is shown to be optimal.

e3078de2ac4125b575b307af47fdc5421d38593f,Evaluation of computational genotyping of structural variation for clinical diagnoses,"BACKGROUND
Structural variation (SV) plays a pivotal role in genetic disease. The discovery of SVs based on short DNA sequence reads from next-generation DNA sequence methods is error-prone, with low sensitivity and high false discovery rates. These shortcomings can be partially overcome with extensive orthogonal validation methods or use of long reads, but the current cost precludes their application for routine clinical diagnostics. In contrast, SV genotyping of known sites of SV occurrence is relatively robust and therefore offers a cost-effective clinical diagnostic tool with potentially few false-positive and false-negative results, even when applied to short-read DNA sequence data.


RESULTS
We assess 5 state-of-the-art SV genotyping software methods, applied to short-read sequence data. The methods are characterized on the basis of their ability to genotype different SV types, spanning different size ranges. Furthermore, we analyze their ability to parse different VCF file subformats and assess their reliance on specific metadata. We compare the SV genotyping methods across a range of simulated and real data including SVs that were not found with Illumina data alone. We assess sensitivity and the ability to filter initial false discovery calls. We determined the impact of SV type and size on the performance for each SV genotyper. Overall, STIX performed the best on both simulated and GiaB based SV calls, demonstrating a good balance between sensitivity and specificty.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that, although SV genotyping software methods have superior performance to SV callers, there are limitations that suggest the need for further innovation.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Varuna Chander"", ids = ""153293303""); list(name = ""Richard A.

Populations of barred sand bass in southern California have experienced severe declines in numbers over the last decade subsequently leading to severely depressed status of the recreational fishery. such large population declines can lead to an overall decrease in genetic diversity. the present study examined the genetic diversity in this species (n = 365) using both the control region of the mitochondrial Dna and microsatellite markers for locations throughout California and baja California. both markers showed a high degree of genetic diversity and genetic mixing however there is some evidence of structuring between locations north and south of the san Quintin upwelling zone. Despite the weak structuring observed around the upwelling zone, barred sand bass throughout the northeastern Pacific likely comprise a single large population. INTRODUCTION Molecular genetic techniques have become more widespread in oceanic systems and in fishery management (ryman 1991; ensing et al. 2013) due to the ability to identify distinct genetic stocks, the genetic health, and connectivity between stocks (PalsbÃ¸ll et al. 2007; Dudgeon et al. 2012; ovenden et al. 2015). Fishery stocks are identified using various life history parameters that do not necessarily reflect the genetic population or stock (shaklee et al. 1999; hutchinson et al. 2003; hutchinson 2008; reiss et al. 2009). additionally, boundaries established by state or international borders can divide a biological stock into multiple fishery stocks ( shaklee et al. 1999). therefore, it is important to understand what constitutes a biological stock to better manage fisheries. a high degree of genetic variation facilitates the adaptation of a species to a variety of environmental or anthropogenic conditions and thus, species (or population) survival (Carvalho and hauser 1994; Kenchington et al. 2003). Connectivity between populations or stocks is also important for fishery management because it can identify source and sink populations and the potential for replenishment of depleted stocks (PalsbÃ¸ll et al. 2007). therefore, it is essential to quantify genetic variation and connectivity within a species to inform management decisions that maintain that variation (ryman 1991; airame et al. 2003; PÃ©rez-ruzafa et al. 2006; PalsbÃ¸ll et al. 2007). the barred sand bass, Paralabrax nebulifer, ranges from santa Cruz, Ca to the southern tip of the baja California peninsula in Mexico (Love et al. 1996) and is fished in both countries. barred sand bass form large spawning aggregations along the coast from late spring to early fall with a peak in July (Love et al. 1996; bacahovey et al. 2002; Mason and Lowe 2010). individuals exhibit site fidelity during non-spawning months and some exhibit site fidelity year round, not participating in spawning aggregations (Jarvis et al. 2010; Mason and Lowe 2010). the majority of barred sand bass also exhibit a preference for spawning locations from year to year (Jarvis et al. 2010). barred sand bass migrate moderate distances (average of 15 km ranging from 1 km to 40 km) ( Jarvis et al. 2010) to reach spawning locations; however, individuals with overlapping home ranges do not necessarily migrate to the same spawning grounds (Jarvis et al. 2010). because of these characteristics of its mating system, barred sand bass comprise one of the most important recreational fisheries in southern California. the species was commercially fished until the 1950s, and since then, it has been recreationally fished off the coast of southern California (young 1963). the recreational fishery for barred sand bass experienced a collapse in 2003 due to the targeting of spawning aggregations and a decline in landings and biomass estimates (erisman et al. 2011). in addition to the recreational fishery in California, there is a small scale commercial fishery in baja California, Mexico. this small scale fishery has the highest catch in tons of any fished species along the Pacific Coast of Paterson et al.: the genetic diversity and PoPulation structure of barred sand bass, PARALABRAX NEBULIFER calcofi rep., vol. 56, 2015 2 fornia and baja California, Mexico. the mitochondrial Dna control region is a common marker for population structure analysis due to the high variability of the region (Magoulas 2005), while microsatellite markers are ideal for population studies due to their high variability ( Wirgin and Waldman 2005). MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection and Extractions tissue samples from either the fin, gill rakers, muscle, or liver tissues of individual barred sand bass were collected using sterile techniques and stored in 95% ethanol and subsequently frozen in a â€“4 ÌŠC freezer at California state University, northridge. samples from southern California were collected using hook and line from five locations (Ventura, Marina Del rey, Los angeles/Long beach harbor, san Clemente, and san Diego) and from commercial fishers from eight sites in baja California, Mexico (Popolta, san Quintin/Camalu, santa rosalita, Laguna Manuela, isla Cedros, Punta abreojos, and bahia Magdalena) (fig. 1). samples from Ventura, Marina Del rey, Los angeles/Long beach harbor, san Diego, santa rosalita, san Quintin, Popolta, Laguna Manuela, and Camalu were collected during the non-spawning season while samples from san Clemente, isla Cedros, Punta abreojos, and bahia Magdalena were sampled during the spawning season. For each site, 7â€“30 individuals were sampled (Ventura, n = 21; san Quintin, n = 9; Laguna Manuela, n = 9; Popotla, n = 7; all other sites n = 30). additional barred sand bass samples that were collected from 1997 to 1999 from santa barbara, California to isla Cedros, Mexico (san Diego, n = 9; Platform Gina, n = 1; Los angeles/Long beach harbor, n = 37; san Quintin, n = 13; isla san Martin, n = 6; isla Cedros, n = 2). the samples from isla san Martin and isla Cedros were collected during the non-spawning season while the sample from Platform Gina in santa barbara was collected during spawning season. samples from Long beach were collected in both non-spawning and spawning season. extractions were carried out using a Dneasy blood and tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Mitochondrial DNA Amplification and Sequencing the mitochondrial Dna control region was amplified in 25 Î¼l polymerase chain reactions (PCr) containing ~100 ng Dna, 1 uM of primer (FWD 5'-ttCCaCCtCtaaCtCCCaaaGCtaG-3') and reverse (reV 5'-aCGCtGGaaaGaaCG CCCGGCatGG-3'; Lee et al. 1995), and 1X econotaqÂ® PLUs 2X Master Mix (Lucigen). PCr conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 ÌŠC for two minutes, followed baja California (rosales-Casian and Gonzalez-Camacho 2003; erisman et al. 2011). several aspects of the biology of the barred sand bass have been studied including life history (baca-hovey et al. 2002; sadovy and Domeier 2005; Jarvis et al. 2010; Cota-Gomez et al. 2013), ecology (Mason and Lowe 2010) and the fishery (erisman et al. 2011; Miller and erisman 2014); however, the genetic diversity and population structure of barred sand bass off both southern and baja California is unknown. one concern for barred sand bass populations is a decline in the genetic diversity due to the fishery collapse in southern California (smith et al. 1991; hutchinson et al. 2003) and the potential for reduction in the body size at first reproduction (van Wijk et al. 2013; alÃ³s et al. 2014). in order to determine potential effects of the fishery collapse on the genetic diversity of barred sand bass, we must first determine what the genetic diversity and population structure of barred sand bass is. based on what is known about other species of Paralabrax, we expect to see a high degree of connectivity due to its reproductive mode and the potential for the larvae to be transported considerable distances via the currents (selkoe and toonen 2011). barred sand bass have a pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 21â€“30 days (allen and block 2012) that is comparable to two congeners: the kelp bass, P. clathratus, and the spotted sand bass, P. maculatofasciatus. in both of these species there was a high degree of connectivity throughout the region (mtDna control region; Phalen 1999; salomon 2005); however, the spotted sand bass shows some evidence for divergent populations between southern California and baja California that may be due to the san Quintin upwelling zone in baja California, Mexico (salomon 2005). Population genetic structure was also low in the kelp bass using microsatellites with a greater degree of structuring in southern California compared with baja California (selkoe et al. 2006; selkoe et al. 2007). this upwelling zone is a known biogeographic barrier for migratory species (bernardi 2000; terry et al. 2000; bernardi et al. 2003; olivares-banuelos et al. 2008). the upwelling zone is thought to also be a barrier for larval dispersal (butler et al. 1982; shanks and eckert 2005). thus, we expected to show a genetic break around the san Quintin upwelling zone in barred sand bass given that this division is seen in its sister species the spotted sand bass. the goal of this study was to determine the genetic diversity, population structure, and connectivity among localities of barred sand bass to inform the conservation management of genetic stocks. this study used both mitochondrial Dna markers and nuclear Dna markers (microsatellite loci) to determine the population structure of barred sand bass in southern CaliPaterson et al.: the genetic diversity and PoPulation structure of barred sand bass, PARALABRAX NEBULIFER calcofi rep., vol. 56, 2015 3 sampling locations was calculated in arlequin 3.5 (excoffier and Lischer 2010) with significance being determined by permutation (10,000 replicates) and the false discovery rate used to correct for ",2015,,"list(name = ""Chris L.

e1a69c486db557db634c0d79a0e91d643834ca70,"DNA methylation in nasal epithelium, atopy, and atopic asthma in children: a genome-wide study.","BACKGROUND
Epigenetic mechanisms could alter the airway epithelial barrier and ultimately lead to atopic diseases such as asthma. We aimed to identify DNA methylation profiles that are associated with-and could accurately classify-atopy and atopic asthma in school-aged children.


METHODS
We did a genome-wide study of DNA methylation in nasal epithelium and atopy or atopic asthma in 483 Puerto Rican children aged 9-20 years, recruited using multistage probability sampling. Atopy was defined as at least one positive IgE (â‰¥0Â·35 IU/mL) to common aeroallergens, and asthma was defined as a physician's diagnosis plus wheeze in the previous year. Significant (false discovery rate p<0Â·01) methylation signals were correlated with gene expression, and top CpGs were validated by pyrosequencing. We then replicated our top methylation findings in a cohort of 72 predominantly African American children, and in 432 children from a European birth cohort. Next, we tested classification models based on nasal methylation for atopy or atopic asthma in all cohorts.


FINDINGS
DNA methylation profiles were markedly different between children with (n=312) and without (n=171) atopy in the Puerto Rico discovery cohort, recruited from Feb 12, 2014, until May 8, 2017. After adjustment for covariates and multiple testing, we found 8664 differentially methylated CpGs by atopy, with false discovery rate-adjusted p values ranging from 9Â·58â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10-17 to 2Â·18â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10-22 for the top 30 CpGs. These CpGs were in or near genes relevant to epithelial barrier function, including CDHR3 and CDH26, and in other genes related to airway epithelial integrity and immune regulation, such as FBXL7, NTRK1, and SLC9A3. Moreover, 28 of the top 30 CpGs replicated in the same direction in both independent cohorts. Classification models of atopy based on nasal methylation performed well in the Puerto Rico cohort (area under the curve [AUC] 0Â·93-0Â·94 and accuracy 85-88%) and in both replication cohorts (AUC 0Â·74-0Â·92, accuracy 68-82%). The models also performed well for atopic asthma in the Puerto Rico cohort (AUC 0Â·95-1Â·00, accuracy 88%) and the replication cohorts (AUC 0Â·82-0Â·88, accuracy 86%).


INTERPRETATION
We identified specific methylation profiles in airway epithelium that are associated with atopy and atopic asthma in children, and a nasal methylation panel that could classify children by atopy or atopic asthma. Our findings support the feasibility of using the nasal methylome for future clinical applications, such as predicting the development of asthma among wheezing infants.

2e03dc7a8a6520b13664eba5096499d3e53c925f,Replicated Umbilical Cord Blood DNA Methylation Loci Associated with Gestational Age at Birth,"Background DNA methylation is highly sensitive to in utero perturbations and has an established role in both embryonic development and regulation of gene expression. The fetal genetic component has been previously shown to contribute significantly to the timing of birth, yet little is known about the identity and behavior of individual genes. Objectives The aim of this study was to test the extent genome-wide DNA methylation levels in umbilical cord blood were associated with gestational age at birth (GA). Findings were validated in an independent sample and evidence for the regulation of gene expression was evaluated for cis gene relationships in matched specimens. Results Genome-wide DNA methylation, measured by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip, was associated with GA for 2,372 CpG probes (5% false discovery rate) in both the Pregnancy, Race, Environment, Genes (PREG â€“ Virginia Commonwealth University) and Newborn Epigenetic Study (NEST â€“ Duke University) cohorts. Significant probes mapped to 1,640 characterized genes and an association with nearby gene expression measures obtained by the Affymetrix HG-133A microarray was found for 11 genes. Differentially methylated positions were enriched for actively transcribed and enhancer chromatin states, were predominately located outside of CpG islands, and mapped to genes enriched for inflammation and innate immunity ontologies. In both PREG and NEST, the first principal component derived from these probes explained approximately one-half (58.1% and 47.8%, respectively) of the variation in GA. This assessment provides a strong evidence to support the importance of DNAm change throughout the gestational time period. Conclusions These results converge on support for the role of variation in DNAm measures as an important genetic regulatory mechanism contributing to inter-individual differences in gestational age at birth. In particular, the pathways described are consistent with the well-known hypothesis of pathogen detection and response by the immune system to elicit premature labor as a consequence of unscheduled inflammation.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Timothy York"", ids = ""3176150""); list(name = ""Colleen K Jackson-Cook"", ids = ""1398225308""); list(name = ""Sara Moyer"", ids = ""48071777""); list(name = ""Roxann Roberson-Nay"", ids = ""1399022587""); list(name = ""Susan K.

Pairwise comparisons of the three strains at base level and stressed state respectively show that for C41 and C43, but not BL21, the majority of proteins are produced in the same amounts at both states.

f713fd54b04495708fcfa55727fa2db028ffefbe,Threeâ€Component Mixture Modelâ€Based Adverse Drug Event Signal Detection for the Adverse Event Reporting System,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is an important source for detecting adverse drug event (ADE) signals. In this article, we propose a three-component mixture model (3CMM) for FAERS signal detection. In 3CMM, a drug-ADE pair is assumed to have either a zero relative risk (RR), or a background RR (mean RRâ€‰=â€‰1), or an increased RR (mean RR >1). By clearly defining the second component (mean RRâ€‰=â€‰1) as the null distribution, 3CMM estimates local false discovery rates (FDRs) for ADE signals under the empirical Bayes framework. Compared with existing approaches, the local FDR's top signals have noninferior or better sensitivities to detect true signals in both FAERS analysis and simulation studies.

2f45789fcc6f70de422406dc1d2ff38f2b2934e0,The Impact of Multiparity on Uterine Gene Expression and Decidualization in Mice,"It has been well established that a previous pregnancy exhibits a beneficial effect on the subsequent pregnancy. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been defined. We hypothesized that multiparity may affect decidualization process during early pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed global gene changes associated with multiparity in the mouse uterus using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We identified a total of 131 differentially expressed genes (fold change > 2 and false discovery rate < 0.05), of which 58 were downregulated and 73 genes were upregulated in the second pregnancy (SP) compared to the first pregnancy. Functional clustering analysis showed that genes involved in stress response were significantly enriched. Most importantly, a significant portion of differentially expressed genes, 14 genes or 10.7%, overlapped with the gene list associated with decidualization. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed a decreased expression of 4 genes (Klk1, kallikrein 1; H2-Eb1, histocompatibility 2 class II antigen E beta; Mmp7, matrix metallopeptidase 7; Pdpn, podoplanin) and an increase in expression of 2 genes (Thy1, thymus cell antigen 1; Ptgs2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2) in SP. Beyond protein-coding genes, we also identified a differentially expressed long noncoding RNA AI506816.

8e6385f34f443e24ae9449af8d87a3595b8815ef,Whole genome scan to detect chromosomal regions affecting multiple traits in dairy cattle.,"Chromosomal regions affecting multiple traits (multiple trait quantitative trait regions or MQR) in dairy cattle were detected using a method based on results from single trait analyses to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL). The covariance between contrasts for different traits in single trait regression analysis was computed. A chromosomal region was considered an MQR when the observed covariance between contrasts deviated from the expected covariance under the null hypothesis of no pleiotropy or close linkage. The expected covariance and the confidence interval for the expected covariance were determined by permutation of the data. Four categories of traits were analyzed: production (5 traits), udder conformation (6 traits), udder health (2 traits), and fertility (2 traits). The analysis of a granddaughter design involving 833 sons of 20 grandsires resulted in 59 MQR (alpha = 0.01, chromosomewise). Fifteen MQR were found on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 14. Four or more MQR were found on BTA 6, 13, 19, 22, 23, and 25. Eight MQR involving udder conformation and udder health and 4 MQR involving production traits and udder health were found. Five MQR were identified for combinations of fertility and udder conformation traits, and another 5 MQR were identified for combinations of fertility and production traits. For 22 MQR, the difference between the correlation attributable to the MQR and the overall genetic correlation was >0.60. Although the false discovery rate was relatively high (0.52), it was considered important to present these results to assess potential consequences of using these MQR for marker-assisted selection.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chris Schrooten"", ids = ""4643006""); list(name = ""Marco Cam Bink"", ids = ""2337301""); list(name = ""Henk Bovenhuis"", ids = ""89590441"")",1b93f3aa5eba418fafa6ec9e0db5ed35734e3192; 5f38b1d575cfe6c513960bed5d56ff8d473e96c7; 189fbf6a8caf9977c93351c53334492251d0e01f; ab52df2ea8c4fc6af37474f01eb3d3b4e8ec7d72; f7ace9eabd986d015e77ed010f77303be18fdffe; d8f1c85a6036749578be86acdf551be5b9a651fb; af0437235a51d4107f3237b8fb478c75065744f9; 23ed76e2d86c600242b0b952735d74e796ea7ba4; 8a25945b2dc0bb83a05e17e05e74f15cf2a37c3c; 1ddfddb0adbd881f332161c16a906edf107a5582; 94f306776b2473d31cb5c18cacf8349c2d6e80bc; 4e2f797c62db685d323dcf317056c0f38fb2349c; b8947e8c8186633e0603cea1378bbb321427d61c; a91df562dd2919ef9390b9567968f5aa687f95c1; 16f589a6ae37cade4a0230ea3f756a1da5d0bbeb; 3d4142c25f82baf8dda1aa0f61db87dc0aa96825; d6c040e4de098cc4d04a76ac9a2600410c602f50; fb8d4c6b51de48d2c528b979c96dcff1ac4d9ce2; c1a541cf1d37581326e62ad51b5ede45452f352b; 7686dbe569b8309a338074c814f38625e09be25b; a3a2fb18eaa441ad6b5672b97d287941a00eb393; ede7e3c2e492e297f8ad73ed4c50650eccb82c84; 6b8cce45dd1aea02eceab177311d0dba7869e73d; fa799e8adccaadb94c6270ed3a5c4a30b4b718fd; b044a18834da058d036951dcd0f19dff440be770; 1149e0b72f861050cc3f0c4c90e392227aa1b40a; 63fc786cca36233410d911a097819e53fe9c60ff; b3c1851c7a766672a66b29d3b239a36e57043c72; 75a08a0488fd4504d2c82e3aa6ffa6aa1847989b; a3a4237bc4f37db223c55c6d23b9cb2211137c88; 2ac35fc460a95f81cf8bab3738b3516cfa797fe4; 80d3e1d95e80a38819eff315b1add21969b497a8; 8b2573ab2c9c048652f2e51735b2312254103c4e; d2ff61d1fa29818a8eb608e8d8680e59fdd65ee7,,Journal of dairy science,87 10,"

8b208d277b62355a30dbee112e5629bd64637c0b,DNA Methylation in Newborns and Maternal Smoking in Pregnancy: Genome-wide Consortium Meta-analysis.,"Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, represent a potential mechanism for environmental impacts on human disease. Maternal smoking in pregnancy remains an important public health problem that impacts child health in a myriad of ways and has potential lifelong consequences. The mechanisms are largely unknown, but epigenetics most likely plays a role. We formed the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium and meta-analyzed, across 13 cohorts (n = 6,685), the association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and newborn blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites (CpGs) by using the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Over 6,000 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to maternal smoking at genome-wide statistical significance (false discovery rate, 5%), including 2,965 CpGs corresponding to 2,017 genes not previously related to smoking and methylation in either newborns or adults. Several genes are relevant to diseases that can be caused by maternal smoking (e.g., orofacial clefts and asthma) or adult smoking (e.g., certain cancers). A number of differentially methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We observed enrichment in pathways and processes critical to development. In older children (5 cohorts, n = 3,187), 100% of CpGs gave at least nominal levels of significance, far more than expected by chance (p value < 2.2Â Ã— 10(-16)). Results were robust to different normalization methods used across studies and cell type adjustment. In this large scale meta-analysis of methylation data, we identified numerous loci involved in response to maternal smoking in pregnancy with persistence into later childhood and provide insights into mechanisms underlying effects of this important exposure.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bonnie R Joubert"", ids = ""4371799""); list(name = ""Janine F.

f797c606cb82376c72ef6dc470ed106df86ab71a,Evidence for differential alternative splicing in blood of young boys with autism spectrum disorders,"BackgroundSince RNA expression differences have been reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for blood and brain, and differential alternative splicing (DAS) has been reported in ASD brains, we determined if there was DAS in blood mRNA of ASD subjects compared to typically developing (TD) controls, as well as in ASD subgroups related to cerebral volume.MethodsRNA from blood was processed on whole genome exon arrays for 2-4â€“year-old ASD and TD boys. An ANCOVA with age and batch as covariates was used to predict DAS for ALL ASD (n=30), ASD with normal total cerebral volumes (NTCV), and ASD with large total cerebral volumes (LTCV) compared to TD controls (n=20).ResultsA total of 53 genes were predicted to have DAS for ALL ASD versus TD, 169 genes for ASD_NTCV versus TD, 1 gene for ASD_LTCV versus TD, and 27 genes for ASD_LTCV versus ASD_NTCV. These differences were significant at P <0.05 after false discovery rate corrections for multiple comparisons (FDR <5% false positives). A number of the genes predicted to have DAS in ASD are known to regulate DAS (SFPQ, SRPK1, SRSF11, SRSF2IP, FUS, LSM14A). In addition, a number of genes with predicted DAS are involved in pathways implicated in previous ASD studies, such as ROS monocyte/macrophage, Natural Killer Cell, mTOR, and NGF signaling. The only pathways significant after multiple comparison corrections (FDR <0.05) were the Nrf2-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidative response (superoxide dismutase 2, catalase, peroxiredoxin 1, PIK3C3, DNAJC17, microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3) and superoxide radical degradation (SOD2, CAT).ConclusionsThese data support differences in alternative splicing of mRNA in blood of ASD subjects compared to TD controls that differ related to head size. The findings are preliminary, need to be replicated in independent cohorts, and predicted alternative splicing differences need to be confirmed using direct analytical methods.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Boryana Stamova"", ids = ""3587790""); list(name = ""Yingfang Tian"", ids = ""46879890""); list(name = ""Christine Wu Nordahl"", ids = ""2890740""); list(name = ""Mark D.

901719baba46ad8a7a2b61c46bd2f23445013606,An empirical Bayes approach for multiple tissue eQTL analysis,"SUMMARY Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify genetic markers associated with the expression of a gene. Most upâ€toâ€date eQTL studies consider the connection between genetic variation and expression in a single tissue. Multiâ€tissue analyses have the potential to improve findings in a single tissue, and elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between tissues. In this article, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model (MTâ€eQTL) for multiâ€tissue eQTL analysis. MTâ€eQTL explicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTL, as well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. We devise an efficient Expectationâ€Maximization (EM) algorithm for model fitting. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the configuration of eQTL across tissues are derived from the adaptive thresholding of local false discovery rates, and maximum a posteriori estimation, respectively. We also provide theoretical justification of the adaptive procedure. We investigate the MTâ€eQTL model through an extensive analysis of a 9â€tissue data set from the GTEx initiative.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gen Li"", ids = ""49461157""); list(name = ""Andrey A.

1e2aa927e930e10a98892afeabf7b05ba05df7a7,Radar Target Detection Framework Based on False Discovery Rate,"A new framework is presented for the detection of targets in clutter and noise. Conventional radar detection techniques involve testing each test cell separately at a predefined probability of false alarm. In this paper, we formulate a novel surveillance paradigm that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for a specified surveillance area (SA), which consists of a number of test cells. FDR is defined as the expectation of the ratio of the number of false alarms to the total number of cells classified as targets over the entire SA. It is observed that control of FDR results in an increase in the probabilities of detection and false alarm with an increase in the number of targets in the SA. This is achieved without the actual knowledge of the number of targets in the SA. To control the increase of the probability of false alarm and to confine it within a prespecified range, we propose a hybrid detection strategy involving both SA-based testing and per-cell testing. Our proposed hybrid approach, based on the concept of algorithm fusion, provides substantial improvement in detection performance in target-rich environments at the cost of a controlled increase in the false alarm rate. Analytical and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.",2011,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Priyadip Ray"", ids = ""48874255""); list(name = ""Pramod K.

a5df3142ead587af01498707298910d349a4758f,DNA methylation in the APOE genomic region is associated with cognitive function in African Americans,"BackgroundGenetic variations in apolipoprotein E (APOE) and proximal genes (PVRL2, TOMM40, and APOC1) are associated with cognitive function and dementia, particularly Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. Recent studies have found evidence that DNA methylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia, but its association with cognitive function in populations without dementia remains unclear.MethodsWe assessed DNA methylation levels of 48 CpG sites in the APOE genomic region in peripheral blood leukocytes collected from 289 African Americans (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰67Â years) from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. Using linear regression, we examined the relationship between methylation in the APOE genomic region and multiple cognitive measures including learning, memory, processing speed, concentration, language and global cognitive function.ResultsWe identified eight CpG sites in three genes (PVRL2, TOMM40, and APOE) that showed an inverse association between methylation level and delayed recall, a measure of memory, after adjusting for age and sex (False Discovery Rate q-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.1). All eight CpGs are located in either CpG islands (CGIs) or CGI shelves, and six of them are in promoter regions. Education and APOE Îµ4 carrier status significantly modified the effect of methylation in cg08583001 (PVRL2) and cg22024783 (TOMM40), respectively. Together, methylation of the eight CpGs explained an additional 8.7% of the variance in delayed recall, after adjustment for age, sex, education, and APOE Îµ4 carrier status. Methylation was not significantly associated with any other cognitive measures.ConclusionsOur results suggest that methylation levels at multiple CpGs in the APOE genomic region are inversely associated with delayed recall during normal cognitive aging, even after accounting for known genetic predictors for cognition.

Using simulations with parameters informed by the data, we find that this methodology is conservative and underestimates the proportion of nonzeroâ€alpha funds. For example, 65% of funds with economically large alphas of Â±2% are misclassified as zero alpha. This bias arises from the low signalâ€toâ€noise ratio in fund returns and the resulting low statistical power.

184dfcad9dc19d5bfc1c27d14c9291fb9b2d1b04,Optimal ranking in multi-label classification using local precision rates,"Multi-label classification is increasingly common in modern applications such as medical diagnosis and document categorization. One important issue in multi-label classification is the existence of statistical difference of classifier scores among different classes. When not accounted for properly, such differences can lead to poor classification decisions on some classes. We address this issue by developing a strategy based on a new concept, Local Precision Rate (LPR), under the assumption that classifiers learned for each class are given and corresponding classifier scores for a set of training objects and a set of objects to be classified are available. Under certain conditions, we show that transforming the classifier scores into LPRs and making classification decisions by comparing LPR values for all objects against all classes can theoretically guarantee the maximum of precision at any recall rate. We also show that LPR is mathematically equivalent to 1lFDR, where lFDR stands for local false discovery rate. This equivalence and the Bayesian interpretation of lFDR provide an alternative justification for the theoretical optimal property of LPR. We propose a new estimation method for 1lFDR (or LPR) based on the formulation of LPR, since the original formulation of 1-lFDR has limitations for estimation when data are noisy. Numerical studies are conducted based on both simulation and real data to demonstrate the superior performance of LPR over existing methods.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ci-Ren Jiang"", ids = ""2088671""); list(name = ""Chun-Chi Liu"", ids = ""7531593""); list(name = ""Xianghong Jasmine Zhou"", ids = ""1753322""); list(name = ""Haiyan Huang"", ids = ""49697850"")",02bcf7fc1d834e6610db5e470a4919f0d48e90e6; 26d8f323e8a1318f0ae765a227a99be5ac61d61d; 6819d4ec1c7c2a0103a47ac6c65674bdf5bece8f,468dc6c05de497cdee7cb11a3eb86172308852f9; 762a315d5a508343cf526106e146af866b452a42; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 4790cf38ef91f2564a7926b882825474e53ceb78; 0a665d99541ed9a5c509fa87db5581f30bb364f6; b07f0f4553cfb42c0ed2bd6b07c9b22777b313d8; 9b8ca5fcde6faa654124803b2813e5590ba689a7; 40212e9474c3ddf3d8c6ffd13dd3211ec9406c49; 06ac7bafac5ed14aca7dd79150b68d2a92fc0ffb; 30b2a3422332a76663110beae4bfc4d74763f4a0; b7fbda9af99cac46ff243e962fd8b4592119aa65; e1dd7aab4aaa38940fd26f357e78f90099c8c112; ec6675372dca6325db95783dcf0e26213ad34095; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 59d7fd8aa4883e98e56a4df34caf25b425637044; 5dd2993d93ad16c8a4934a836a132c708318754d; 2a5ae7d06748fdfd373c1222aa8244f035fd74e6; a6b396ca4b4a8b63166f0fa8fe314c50f17739b4; 7fe59a873246a62128549c29cb3543cb9390f1d5; b4bc7593656ea464b4d06063cc964c1c65d32511; 273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1; 01f3a2d40a748fdd571f9cdb6fc402118919307e; 9a39e80d9bae8fb7b6b087c32e8357e2b9f101b7; 384bb3944abe9441dcd2cede5e7cd7353e9ee5f7; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; c478c2cbdbbf38df5b1247d16a2bfc01667ef848; 5cd1c62dc99b6c3ecb2e678aa6fb2bffe3853c28; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; 2abe6b9ea1b13653b7384e9c8ef14b0d87e20cfc; c5f20f69f73e48f3268ca0627bf3e32bc5f26f8d; 896b9c1551b7ffa347baed144582ec3b5d88f703; ff78767c3fe6865f8c648b22e518cbbdfd9e0af1; 5ae9e6394845da8afc53857ff97149d0528b392f; 211229be3e804881118ec8ab95da511df65fb4df; d2f18a46b5444d00191e74a4d854ef95eed110b0; c5cd0dfa5978b0e3b5421c383e960ed16dced09a; f3ebf945aba8d70b8d7daf14021fe1220752f0f7; 2b669f9b528b657cf3e3c202bcc78ea49c9fe0ad,Statistica Sinica,,

The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of IA via bioinformatic analysis. Various gene expression profiles (GSE26969) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 3 IA and 3 normal superficial temporal artery samples. Firstly, the limma package in R language was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs; Pâ€‘valueÂ <0.01 and |log2 FC|â‰¥1). Secondly, the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery software was utilized to perform pathway and functional enrichment analyses (false discovery rate â‰¤0.05). Finally, proteinâ€‘protein interaction (PPI) network and subâ€‘network clustering analyses were performed using the biomolecular interaction network database and ClusterONE software, respectively. Following this, a transcription factor regulatory network was identified from the PPI network. A total of 1,124 DEGs were identified, of which 989 were upregulated and 135 downregulated. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses revealed that the DEGs primarily participated in RNA splicing, functioning of the spliceosome, RNA processing and the mRNA metabolic process. Following PPI network analysis, 1 hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4A (transcription factor)â€‘centered regulatory network and 5 DEGâ€‘centered subâ€‘networks were identified. On analysis of the transcription factor regulatory network, 6 transcription factors (HNF6, HNF4A, E2F4, YY1, H4 and H31T) and a regulatory pathway (HNF6â€‘HNF4â€‘E2F4) were identified. The results of the present study suggest that activating transcription factorâ€‘5, Jun protoâ€‘oncogene, activator proteinâ€‘1 transcription factor subunit, HNF6, HNF4 and E2F4 may participate in IA progression via vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, inflammation, vessel wall remodeling and damage and the tumor necrosis factorâ€‘Î² signaling pathway.

f71e8153d60b2e4a0d5c7ee1476040886e61672d,Exploring multilocus associations of inflammation genes and colorectal cancer risk using hapConstructor,"BackgroundIn candidate-gene association studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multilocus analyses are frequently of high dimensionality when considering haplotypes or haplotype pairs (diplotypes) and differing modes of expression. Often, while candidate genes are selected based on their biological involvement in a given pathway, little is known about the functionality of SNPs to guide association studies. Investigators face the challenge of exploring multiple SNP models to elucidate which variants, independently or in combination, might be associated with a disease of interest. A data mining module, hapConstructor (freely-available in Genie software) performs systematic construction and association testing of multilocus genotype data in a Monte Carlo framework. Our objective was to assess its utility to guide statistical analyses of haplotypes within a candidate region (or combined genotypes across candidate genes) beyond that offered by a standard logistic regression approach.MethodsWe applied the hapConstructor method to a multilocus investigation of candidate genes involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 production, IKBKB, IL6, and NFKB1 (16 SNPs total) hypothesized to operate together to alter colorectal cancer risk. Data come from two U.S. multicenter studies, one of colon cancer (1,556 cases and 1,956 matched controls) and one of rectal cancer (754 cases and 959 matched controls).ResultsHapConstrcutor enabled us to identify important associations that were further analyzed in logistic regression models to simultaneously adjust for confounders.

953ee4f3f368a085f3dfdf03fd2a36465d829e86,Estimating the Total Number of Susceptibility Variants Underlying Complex Diseases from Genome-Wide Association Studies,"Recently genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous susceptibility variants for complex diseases. In this study we proposed several approaches to estimate the total number of variants underlying these diseases. We assume that the variance explained by genetic markers (Vg) follow an exponential distribution, which is justified by previous studies on theories of adaptation. Our aim is to fit the observed distribution of Vg from GWAS to its theoretical distribution. The number of variants is obtained by the heritability divided by the estimated mean of the exponential distribution. In practice, due to limited sample sizes, there is insufficient power to detect variants with small effects. Therefore the power was taken into account in fitting. Besides considering the most significant variants, we also tried to relax the significance threshold, allowing more markers to be fitted. The effects of false positive variants were removed by considering the local false discovery rates. In addition, we developed an alternative approach by directly fitting the z-statistics from GWAS to its theoretical distribution. In all cases, the ""winner's curse"" effect was corrected analytically. Confidence intervals were also derived. Simulations were performed to compare and verify the performance of different estimators (which incorporates various means of winner's curse correction) and the coverage of the proposed analytic confidence intervals. Our methodology only requires summary statistics and is able to handle both binary and continuous traits. Finally we applied the methods to a few real disease examples (lipid traits, type 2 diabetes and Crohn's disease) and estimated that hundreds to nearly a thousand variants underlie these traits.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hon-Cheong So"", ids = ""7233632""); list(name = ""Benjamin H.

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a prevalent and debilitating pelvic disorder generally accompanied by chronic pain combined with chronic urinating problems. Over one million Americans are affected, especially middle-aged women. However, its aetiology or mechanism remains unclear. No efficient drug has been provided to patients. Several urinary biomarker candidates have been identified for IC; among the most promising is antiproliferative factor (APF), whose biological activity is detectable in urine specimens from >94% of patients with both ulcerative and non-ulcerative IC. The present study identified several important mediators of the effect of APF on bladder cell physiology, suggesting several candidate drug targets against IC. In an attempt to identify potential proteins and genes regulated by APF in vivo, and to possibly expand the APF-regulated network identified by stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we performed an integration analysis of our own SILAC data and the microarray data of Gamper et al. (2009) BMC Genomics 10: 199. Notably, two of the proteins (i.e. MAPKSP1 and GSPT1) that are down-regulated by APF are involved in the activation of mTORC1, suggesting that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is potentially a critical pathway regulated by APF in vivo. Several components of the mTOR pathway are currently being studied as potential therapeutic targets in other diseases. Our analysis suggests that this pathway might also be relevant in the design of diagnostic tools and medications targeting IC.


OBJECTIVE
â€¢ To enhance our understanding of the interstitial cystitis urine biomarker antiproliferative factor (APF), as well as interstitial cystitis biology more generally at the systems level, we reanalyzed recently published large-scale quantitative proteomics and in vivo transcriptomics data sets using an integration analysis tool that we have developed.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
â€¢ To identify more differentially expressed genes with a lower false discovery rate from a previously published microarray data set, an integrative hypothesis-testing statistical approach was applied. â€¢ For validation experiments, expression and phosphorylation levels of select proteins were evaluated by western blotting.


RESULTS
â€¢ Integration analysis of this transcriptomics data set with our own quantitative proteomics data set identified 10 genes that are potentially regulated by APF in vivo from 4140 differentially expressed genes identified with a false discovery rate of 1%. â€¢ Of these, five (i.e. JUP, MAPKSP1, GSPT1, PTGS2/COX-2 and XPOT) were found to be prominent after network modelling of the common genes identified in the proteomics and microarray studies. â€¢ This molecular signature reflects the biological processes of cell adhesion, cell proliferation and inflammation, which is consistent with the known physiological effects of APF. â€¢ Lastly, we found the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway was down-regulated in response to APF.


CONCLUSION
â€¢ This unbiased integration analysis of in vitro quantitative proteomics data with in vivo quantitative transcriptomics data led to the identification of potential downstream mediators of the APF signal transduction pathway.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Yang"", ids = ""97364436""); list(name = ""Yongsoo Kim"", ids = ""49170732""); list(name = ""Taek-Kyun Kim"", ids = ""48271319""); list(name = ""Susan K.

In this paper, we propose two novel online traffic classifiers - one based on Neyman-Pearson classification and one based on the Learning Satisfiability (LSAT) framework - that can provide class-specific performance guarantees on the false alarm and false discovery rates, respectively. We also present a preprocessor for our classifiers that predicts, after the reception of only a small number of packets, whether a flow will be 'large' (as defined by a network operator). Only these resource-intensive flows are passed to the classifier, greatly reducing the computation burden imposed.

a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c,STAR: A general interactive framework for FDR control under structural constraints,"We propose a general framework based on \textit{selectively traversed accumulation rules} (STAR) for interactive ""human-in-the-loop"" multiple testing with generic structural constraints on the rejection set. STAR combines accumulation tests from ordered multiple testing with data-carving ideas from post-selection inference, allowing for highly flexible adaptation to generic structural information. Given independent $p$-values for each of $n$ null hypotheses, STAR defines an iterative protocol for gradually pruning a candidate rejection set, beginning with $\mathcal{R}_0 = [n]$ and shrinking with each step. At step $t$, the analyst estimates the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the current rejection set $\mathcal{R}_t$, and halts and rejects every $H_i$ with $i \in \mathcal{R}_t$ if $\mathrm{FDP}_t \leq \alpha$. Otherwise, the analyst may shrink the rejection set to $\mathcal{R}_{t+1}\subseteq \mathcal{R}_t$ however she wants, provided the choice depends only on partially masked $p$-values $g(p_i)$ for $i\in \mathcal{R}_t$, as well as unmasked $p$-values $p_i$ for $i\notin \mathcal{R}_t$. Typically, the choice will be based on eliminating the ""least promising"" hypothesis from $\mathcal{R}_t$, after estimating a model from the observable data. By restricting the information available to the analyst, our iterative protocol guarantees exact false discovery rate (FDR) control at level $\alpha$ in finite samples, for any data-adaptive update rule the analyst may choose. We suggest heuristic update rules for a variety of applications with complex structural constraints, show that STAR performs well for problems ranging from convex region detection and bump-hunting to FDR control on trees and DAGs, and show how to extend STAR to regression problems where knockoff statistics are available in lieu of $p$-values.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Lihua Lei"", ids = ""40239086""); list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942""); list(name = ""William Fithian"", ids = ""1940063"")",653b6f7c814b3f29fe048796f40e5fdadc2fd4b2; ab30dc8c9e540591a5ca334b5998fba618612cbb; 3564f17d529d0acdca6a3e75bea4fa5fe3ff6a37; f894480feb384ec064962637bbcba1a3b45716ab; 3d4b179a8ea1e7ed76a6d77e232c3d1e2695f959; 133331417f139546f310764ff6a35605548a435e; 28b29ba8db35f001b33240676e3093f8cc73c27f; 2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59; 226c267aea30bb34f2c6c2f0994e1d9cffb7418d; 08939fc026c1efcddeca0e9af4de53e116478deb; baa6897ce34a07fb17ae473f5cd4e9afe4bc668b; efcf4fa58adddffebf6a5a42b99206df5926636c,2a996166c3e3c9373981d3fc1f60b71957987ead; 3e9e9891a01adc7975aeb06a88535af2d0268b1b; 52f84c62e3bb4442cdf72bbb6cddca5be23ac51a; 60ca0e6986b4c52cd9ee2495bb644d8a7eb24fd8; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; d5fe9d77eaca5adf4751fcc5c54eaa1f72e84876; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; aa5b598607e231e9310e7f2bef79ffdfe3c41b57; ec6169ace0de5d14f4ca87f9e9527334a96fd29e; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; 2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59; cdf832ab4fa74d503565396219758961775ca023; 2cc257b0c7db92f90c3224c35df7b8e85f57a090; ed301b1558ef577aadb88ab1f29278d9430432d6; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; c117971e646e96ba2577f8a7f39246f021e08544; 79d096e7a00d73ce2fbc134273c6b8abfe51f2ee; 3fa4eaf74dd684c0ffaab556aad4c976e5cf952a; 7025bdb9317ac27892f6c0c35befd961c3105224; c9dacb27304c7ed0d03d5b2c88ca3e7f9dc5ebe7; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 12708404cd61a0e8e2c1f8c7fc84031441898b56; e07dc56173e919e96f4f2eac65dc9793b34d6c4d; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a; 932c533c94567e9e283f13cb70be71c10b57ca34; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; 408eb55adaee1aee680a23210e7cfe5510e87677; 92927eed3836a927d822fdb8248a45426366d76c; 441cff0110e6699640ab24a1621936c5d16f55ea; 4d79278e8a1612e57e816a308a276134e2401d6f; 8dfeab3c1ba9150c726318b73de2a126b0e0f437; d59f5489324bacdf7bc2ae728443ea7181d73faa; 47064ed2126e76e66d58520a8216908f8f002666; de97265c2425bf2e32c0e81c62fa6a25c711c423; 0baa7d9071f95ca44e1945c70824b6a9ba8197fb; e78994431e72d3d1d64723fd05dcb2524cb8f873; 79e8b756f8cc59b4b5aaf1a7de7094f3a935803e; 06aabaa12e6a030709e7643dee47c68f7ab8f76a; e69bce0185720fcb652ae458a4529a2807f53de8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78; eb746b21e0075f9ef7181b69d7ebf07d42b9c4f3; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; 33a1c61cce7c37a460d65511bd9fffecd6073bb3; 0f4ff4f1b6d60b754cda6eb9b082d83c1bf8831a; efb86ebd6d2a0d3dd8af179551420a41572e5e12; 7ff298b972ee7dff3bb5b4b7fb0b6169a4358d43; 1e18ad1d5a5311cfc801755fbf5a2c302116ffa1; ce3ccde80ccaaa2225b6f495130aefb2cf436e18; d30e8f3e565d4a9df831875c383687507606d4f0; 592e2d2c18907a8ec2c7f5e56ea3cbfce363862d; 40eb9c52649f75b1cfc9b55787d5e58ff9bcf98e; 043849fe787415b8a5022139334eb531f2fb5621; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; 47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8; b163390d64e4865bf57fe6b2699cd2025d99ee73; 4f6fe641e9110bddb73ab685922b0ad014540c35; b0f94065320d9f648babd122db0807dd4ffd181b; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; edf27bb5272ea6fe244deb3bbc8da0429bfe3ac5; ac1fbb3e6e21f28033c732c72ff07c3416d84366; c9b3cbe5c5e1b6914e7ff0dfd1b632126d24b984; 9c878593318d379b8d890abdb4550dd78bfa27e2,arXiv: Methodology,,
45d770da4ac29b52de4f17446d43b45a2b61f3f8,Molecular biomarkers of residual disease after surgical debulking of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,"PURPOSE
Residual disease following primary cytoreduction is associated with adverse overall survival in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Accurate identification of patients at high risk of residual disease has been elusive, lacking external validity and prompting many to undergo unnecessary surgical exploration. Our goal was to identify and validate molecular markers associated with high rates of residual disease.


METHODS
We interrogated two publicly available datasets from chemonaÃ¯ve primary high-grade serous ovarian tumors for genes overexpressed in patients with residual disease and significant at a 10% false discovery rate (FDR) in both datasets. We selected genes with wide dynamic range for validation in an independent cohort using quantitative RT-PCR to assay gene expression, followed by blinded prediction of a patient subset at high risk for residual disease. Predictive success was evaluated using a one-sided Fisher exact test.


RESULTS
Forty-seven probe sets met the 10% FDR criterion in both datasets. These included FABP4 and ADH1B, which tracked tightly, showed dynamic ranges >16-fold and had high expression levels associated with increased incidence of residual disease. In the validation cohort (n = 139), FABP4 and ADH1B were again highly correlated. Using the top quartile of FABP4 PCR values as a prespecified threshold, we found 30 of 35 cases of residual disease in the predicted high-risk group (positive predictive value = 86%) and 54 of 104 among the remaining patients (P = 0.0002; OR, 5.5).


CONCLUSION
High FABP4 and ADH1B expression is associated with significantly higher risk of residual disease in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Patients with high tumoral levels of these genes may be candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Susan L. Tucker"", ids = ""14388092""); list(name = ""Kshipra M.

b015cf5c559ea4e9710e3e58042c679686b3df71,Formal characterization and extension of the linearized diffusion tensor model.,"We analyzed the properties of the logarithm of the Rician distribution leading to a full characterization of the probability law of the errors in the linearized diffusion tensor model. An almost complete lack of bias, a simple relation between the variance and the signal-to-noise ratio in the original complex data, and a close approximation to normality facilitated estimation of the tensor components by an iterative weighted least squares algorithm. The theory of the linear model has also been used to derive the distribution of mean diffusivity, to develop an informative statistical test for relative lack of fit of the ellipsoidal (or spherical) model compared to an unrestricted linear model in which no specific shape is assumed for the diffusion process, and to estimate the signal-to-noise ratios in the original data. The false discovery rate (FDR) has been used to control thresholds for statistical significance in the context of multiple comparisons at voxel level. The methods are illustrated by application to three diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets of clinical interest: a healthy volunteer, a patient with acute brain injury, and a patient with hydrocephalus. Interestingly, some salient features, such as a region normally comprising the basal ganglia and internal capsule, and areas of edema in patients with brain injury and hydrocephalus, had patterns of error largely independent from their mean diffusivities. These observations were made in brain regions with sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratios (>2) to justify the assumptions of the log Rician probability model. The combination of diffusivity and its error may provide added value in diagnostic DTI of acute pathologic expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment in brain parenchymal tissue.",2005,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Raymond Salvador"", ids = ""48497345""); list(name = ""A. de la Pena"", ids = ""32308796""); list(name = ""David K.

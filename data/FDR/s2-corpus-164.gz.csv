3c333841e217fecc04047b0441f275446467c2dd,Large-Scale Discovery of Gene-Enriched SNPs,"Whole-genome association studies of complex traits in higher eukaryotes require a high density of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers at genome-wide coverage. To design high-throughput, multiplexed SNP genotyping assays, researchers must fi rst discover large numbers of SNPs by extensively resequencing multiple individuals or lines. For SNP discovery approaches using short read-lengths that nextgeneration DNA sequencing technologies offer, the highly repetitive and duplicated nature of large plant genomes presents additional challenges. Here, we describe a genomic library construction procedure that facilitates pyrosequencing of genic and low-copy regions in plant genomes, and a customized computational pipeline to analyze and assemble short reads (100â€“200 bp), identify allelic reference sequence comparisons, and call SNPs with a high degree of accuracy. With maize (Zea mays L.) as the test organism in a pilot experiment, the implementation of these methods resulted in the identifi cation of 126,683 putative SNPs between two maize inbred lines at an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 15.1%. We estimated rates of false SNP discovery using an internal control, and we validated these FDR rates with an external SNP dataset that was generated using locus-specifi c PCR amplifi cation and Sanger sequencing. These results show that this approach has wide applicability for effi ciently and accurately detecting geneenriched SNPs in large, complex plant genomes.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Michael A.

150618f0c455c2863eef3831140d64544d443bcc,Nutrition-induced ketosis alters metabolic and signaling gene networks in liver of periparturient dairy cows.,"Dairy cows are highly susceptible after parturition to developing liver lipidosis and ketosis, which are costly diseases to farmers. A bovine microarray platform consisting of 13,257-annotated oligonucleotides was used to study hepatic gene networks underlying nutrition-induced ketosis. On day 5 postpartum, 14 Holstein cows were randomly assigned to ketosis-induction (n = 7) or control (n = 7) groups. Cows in the ketosis-induction group were fed at 50% of day 4 intake until they developed signs of clinical ketosis, and cows in the control group were fed ad libitum throughout the treatment period. Liver was biopsied at 10-14 (ketosis) or 14 days postpartum (controls). Feed restriction increased blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate, but decreased glucose. Liver triacylglycerol concentration also increased. A total of 2,415 genes were altered by ketosis (false discovery rate = 0.05). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed downregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, protein ubiquitination, and ubiquinone biosynthesis with ketosis. Other molecular adaptations included upregulation of genes and nuclear receptors associated with cytokine signaling, fatty acid uptake/transport, and fatty acid oxidation. Genes downregulated during ketosis included several associated with cholesterol metabolism, growth hormone signaling, proton transport, and fatty acid desaturation. Feed restriction and ketosis resulted in previously unrecognized alterations in gene network expression underlying key cellular functions and discrete metabolic events. These responses might help explain well-documented physiological adaptations to reduced feed intake in early postpartum cows and, thus, provide molecular targets that might be useful in prevention and treatment of liver lipidosis and ketosis.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Juan J.

c18799e2ea9187a09a69435b1800c80dce4838e2,Extracting Biological Significant Subnetworks from Protein-Protein Interactions Induced by Differentially Expressed Genes of HIV-1 Vpr Variants,"Identification of protein interaction network is very important to find the cell signaling pathway for a particular disease. The authors have found the differentially expressed genes between two sample groups of HIV-1. Samples are wild type HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-1 mutant Vpr. They did statistical t-test and found false discovery rate FDR to identify the genes increased in expression up-regulated or decreased in expression down-regulated. In the test, the authors have computed q-values of test to identify minimum FDR which occurs. As a result they found 172 differentially expressed genes between their sample wild type HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-1 mutant Vpr, R80A. They found 68 up-regulated genes and 104 down-regulated genes. From the 172 differentially expressed genes the authors found protein-protein interaction network with string-db and then clustered subnetworks the PPI networks with cytoscape3.0. Lastly, the authors studied significance of subnetworks with performing gene ontology and also studied the KEGG pathway of those subnetworks.",2015,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bandana Barman"", ids = ""3065467""); list(name = ""Anirban Mukhopadhyay"", ids = ""144241818"")",80269a2e3cca737eac74739b9ed3932ba3aa1add,f3be37fc100471fdba1381df0f3372f4c5d5d6e1; 7ed1165d5b1a57f22a8c06749c28c4c095078dbb; 8699f1906f4e57ae2add762636eecf4ec00e300d,IJSDA,4,35-51
d3f60f742f60dfee40797b0f2e78b968c01fa95d,Polymorphisms of ACE2 are associated with blood pressure response to cold pressor test: the GenSalt study.,"BACKGROUND
Increased blood pressure (BP) reactivity to cold pressor test (CPT) is a risk factor for hypertension. Genetic factors may influence the variation of BP response to CPT among individuals. We explored the association of genetic variants in the apelin system genes (APLN, APLNR and ACE2) and BP response to CPT in a Chinese population.


METHODS
A total of 1,998 Han Chinese participants from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity completed a CPT. The percentage changes of BP right after the end of ice-water immersion were used as the measurement of BP responses to CPT. Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped, including both tag and potential functional SNPs of the APLN, APLNR, and ACE2 genes. A mixed-effect linear model was used to assess the association between SNPs and BP responses to CPT.


RESULTS
In women, three SNPs (rs1514283, rs4646176, and rs879922) of the ACE2 gene were significantly associated with the diastolic BP (DBP) response to CPT in the general and recessive genetic models after adjustment for multiple testing (all false discovery rate q < 0.05). There were no significant associations of polymorphisms in APLN and APLNR genes with BP responses to CPT.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study identified genetic variants in the ACE2 gene that were significantly associated with DBP responses to cold stress in the Chinese female population. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianfeng Huang"", ids = ""3061925""); list(name = ""Shufeng Chen"", ids = ""2263225""); list(name = ""Xiangfeng Lu"", ids = ""6492202""); list(name = ""Qi Zhao"", ids = ""145542709""); list(name = ""Dabeeru C.

7025bdb9317ac27892f6c0c35befd961c3105224,Wavelet thresholding with bayesian false discovery rate control.,"The false discovery rate (FDR) procedure has become a popular method for handling multiplicity in high-dimensional data. The definition of FDR has a natural Bayesian interpretation; it is the expected proportion of null hypotheses mistakenly rejected given a measure of evidence for their truth. In this article, we propose controlling the positive FDR using a Bayesian approach where the rejection rule is based on the posterior probabilities of the null hypotheses. Correspondence between Bayesian and frequentist measures of evidence in hypothesis testing has been studied in several contexts. Here we extend the comparison to multiple testing with control of the FDR and illustrate the procedure with an application to wavelet thresholding. The problem consists of recovering signal from noisy measurements.

fe1e00c3ffd4bfdf7a9b0bc72dedb135dda202f9,Abnormal Intrinsic Brain Activity Patterns in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis: A Resting-State Functional MR Imaging Study.,"PURPOSE
To analyze the spontaneous brain activity patterns in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with an amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) algorithm.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study received institutional review board approval, and all subjects gave informed consent. Forty-four patients with ESRD, 24 of whom were undergoing PD (PD group; eight women; mean age, 34 years Â± 8) and 20 who were not undergoing PD or hemodialysis (nondialysis group; six women; mean age, 37 years Â± 9) and 24 healthy control subjects (eight women; mean age, 32 years Â± 9 years) were included. All subjects underwent neuropsychologic tests, and patients with ESRD underwent laboratory testing. ALFF values were compared among the three groups. The relationship between ALFF values and clinical markers was investigated by using multiple regression analysis.


RESULTS
Patients in both the PD and nondialysis groups showed lower ALFF values in default mode network regions than did healthy control subjects (P < .01, false discovery rate corrected). Patients in the PD group showed lower ALFF values than did those in the nondialysis group in the left superior parietal lobe (1.51 Â± 0.21 vs 2.01 Â± 0.40), left inferior parietal lobe (0.99 Â± 0.16 vs 1.13 Â± 0.22) and left precuneus (1.45 Â± 0.39 vs 1.77 Â± 0.41) (P < .01, corrected with simulation software). In patients in the PD group, neuropsychologic test scores correlated with ALFF values of the middle temporal gyrus and the parietal and occipital lobe, serum urea and creatinine levels negatively correlated with ALFF in some default mode network regions, and hemoglobin positively correlated with ALFF in the bilateral precuneus, precentral, and supplementary motor areas (P < .01 corrected).


CONCLUSION
Patients with ESRD who were undergoing PD showed more severe spontaneous brain activity abnormalities that correlate with cognitive impairments than did patients who were not undergoing dialysis. Elevated serum urea, creatinine, and lowered hemoglobin levels affect spontaneous brain activity in patients with ESRD.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Song Luo"", ids = ""50240913""); list(name = ""Rong Feng Qi"", ids = ""48917989""); list(name = ""Ji Qiu Wen"", ids = ""24836173""); list(name = ""Jian Hui Zhong"", ids = ""31641924""); list(name = ""Xiang Kong"", ids = ""145771502""); list(name = ""Xue Liang"", ids = ""144729678""); list(name = ""Qiang Xu"", ids = ""144197054""); list(name = ""Gang Zheng"", ids = ""48756816""); list(name = ""Zhe Zhang"", ids = ""14069055""); list(name = ""Long Jiang Zhang"", ids = ""40174740""); list(name = ""Guang Ming Lu"", ids = ""143911583"")",4193e39532409e971a9cd9531bfdc0a78d43da79; 1e8fe2b80e42f6b7ebd3ec8428ea544aea0a1183; 97c879fe901daedcea01b5840675855178ac29f2; 85b7226eba83494a191b97b15e072daa36cdbccc; 30a96c00fb1a33079637fc29c1ce6d956f4fa515; aecf09660a0e8d09e1df3e9d5bb82572572d8fc5; 5137aa53a0764d1f012d4dcb5a6024b8984d3a92; 7a468fcbf7a8c19d21645ebc73e5b585278fdf6f; 5adceee9b64a09e28be51c3641fed4ddd7f62ee3; d547833f9da7998d09431ddb71b89e20bab545f0; 4789588aa4b0a997a055ca3e0129dbe85b4555ff; 1c232a0b3d19a5936337c434e35d6f43d8684e28; 84c3db886527b08a955bb27b2364043a3838283c; 58a8e0636bb446447eca0c07adbae5927d030e0d; 6af89cf4bab882795f990a73d36a4b0ea43bd2a1; 9d4c00d875a2851e6a4b99de60430d32d1391ef4; b6df48e263cc106ff5b8c0368164e450a6e92476; 467f97f4d9162f175d8b9ca9ea92279f41efb527; 1bd19c6fff6cfc3fdf6545a206a5fec59466c61e; ee5360f36271e6e1ec41a7b293149fec5e5699e9; 732e4741925d5d561fa0100f29d34dbf29f9693f,6ae5d8217cafc2f89b83637af4e7e3816cffd1d8; d4d492ff4b471448281c2afbab2cc289352f15d3; 47fb2516cc2823dd344ad5637f47e19b09715afe; b16dbce62954717fbebeeeb5dc8ce82462ec6b71; 01abe2ace565253a86d2856589d21daa36b30062; 1c3f0ec5a089c0e49a4559a056ab40d0cfd59f87; 3ef6dbad586692f12a8f3bf066a438c8d1e44ada; 1e565d84137decf24a02eb11e8bb96212cb733db; e358141c623594a99f6b3baaf284fde949059938; e7678bb78fa645133d131500a864759a6ec2200e; d8e400a855e98b08f90d59fbdaea52a26154f701; fbfff90c4d384cc1317555a56c8e49b3516cbf7e; 33676ad4200b3bc101edaf90afec871ba05f79dd; 1098143e500a2cda0bd5127f5c2e2e538bc40564; 93634c4c4a678d2f15d19bdc163758177a9fa69e; 5c2102795c709839de355fdcf0b0bb8029f93b43; 070aed03de1ff1ffaf8ca679ee8bd036c828e211; b91a61b6fcb1c365afcff402b2742ceaa1a12dee; 78670116ab79905f7269753895e6239cee16d1dd; fc1d568021431e1fd9b4ef2623e5b706f4240239; 79a7803d521f358512569677613377e1367b7661; 296b2f7327f18de00b7fd4142f1812298b0bcfaa; cc2022cf8bc40268acddf2bf7337fdff934c51cb; 8f73770e6ef1d4ad15d33da1c77d74d3989f94ec; 6f41c7f4f8b31b07d30dff042de247ab19b2854d; ce07387b0b32a34f66eb29ad01bf1dc347227148; 0e6e8b7eaa183eaa4c2e7ac00214ec05ed865415; c85062093074b7b225d593ed3ee28bef8f2407d8; 57e3d0266d3f0a5f7ff529acd86b0a4a3ad5231a; 5e83294c8617cbd4358a898144583979b0111ed4; e54545876ad748fad807c93235560bb0fe01b095; fe8e1460fb2bc4f0f1017e01f89a9d32d6716171; e3ab1947b398fe03d3e7b324f6e220e7585c5fea; d3cd6ddd9f988c708ea978456ff74f914034deb9; 58fe1adc39b56b8129b4ab26ff7ba9ccdb99f1e6; 5d639de9aec59f14ac46f85a9a6318c82af2ac58; 165fd770b8893f8511852d44f4d4ac7241eebeeb; 9f22c7780a48f54b60f3e6930ea2ca78605cf3ab; 02c51d8fcf19b623d602134a9f012c033152e375,Radiology,278 1,"

Methods: Germline DNA was extracted from 263 pts of European-American ancestry enrolled in a prospective protocol with full baseline and follow up clinical data. A total of 113 common SNPs within select genes involved in RCC pathogenesis, angiogenesis and drugs metabolism were genotyped and associations sought with clinical outcome. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS), defined as time from VEGF targeted therapy to progression or death. Cox model tested for the association between SNPs with PFS in univariate and multivariate model that adjusted for age, gender, type of VEGF inhibitor and MSKCC risk score. The false discovery rate (pFDR) was used to control for the number of tests performed. Results: The median follow-up time was 51.6 months (mo), 81% of pts had progression or death events.

The false discovery rate (FDR) and its variants provide very important notions of errors in this context comparable to the role of error probabilities in classical testing problems. Accurate estimation of positive FDR (pFDR), a variant of the FDR, is essential in assessing and controlling this measure. In a recent paper, the authors proposed a model-based nonparametric Bayesian method of estimation of the pFDR function. In particular, the density of p-values was modeled as a mixture of decreasing beta densities and an appropriate Dirichlet process was considered as a prior on the mixing measure. The resulting procedure was shown to work well in simulations. In this paper, we provide some theoretical results in support of the beta mixture model for the density of p-values, and show that, under appropriate conditions, the resulting posterior is consistent as the number of hypotheses grows to infinity.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Subhashis Ghosal"", ids = ""2291789""); list(name = ""Anindya Roy"", ids = ""49274309""); list(name = ""Yongqiang Tang"", ids = ""33768582"")",e4148ad5d618fb180dbcbc5fcc7479d84452762b; 7b9dddda3e2c7a7be24abd8f9a9e5d58fdacbee3; 6a17464d5452d257cba944342e067b49228bdaaa; 0d99b581fb132b6b0c96c17d2099e484b9853e79; 50f087a7e8665dab3a87c8bd33e41a5668b6a3d6; 20cdeb11279cfc4d47338507ff73b029988564cc; 82b26d30bf20062e83e618e60d5fa4862f24180b,52413b3078a2c877ec588e39726f539038eee1c5; b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f327a3ec3fd438aa8760c0eccac4b7f79d267b7b; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 0d99b581fb132b6b0c96c17d2099e484b9853e79; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 380f7bf31b898ace68caa597340e39e65926a87e; dbaea7ddacc2aa81e01254b7073c536bc0b5ed0f; 4cb91932b17952b9368199de1b84fb31da308944,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,105-115

When done at a young age, appendicitis followed by appendectomy (AA) offers protection against ulcerative colitis development in later life. We developed the first ever murine AA model. Using this model, we showed earlier that previous AA ameliorated colitis. We aimed to determine whether autophagy genes contribute to the anti-colitis protection conferred by AA, and if so, to delineate the autophagy-linked genes involved in this.


METHODS
Mice with 2 laparotomies each served as controls (sham-sham). Distal colons were harvested (4 AA-group colons, 4 sham-sham group colons), and RNA extracted from each. The RNA was taken through microarray analysis or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation. Gene set enrichment analysis software was used to analyze the microarray data.


RESULTS
Out of 28 key autophagy-related genes investigated (VPS15, VPS34, FIP200, ATG03, ATG04A, ATG04B, ATG05, ATG07, ATG10, ATG12, ATG13b, ATG14, ATG16L1, BECN1, GABARAPL1, IRGM1, IRGM2, LAMP2, LC3A, LC3B, RAB7A, UVRAG, NOD2, XBP1, LRRK2, ULK1, ULK2, PTPN2), 7 have genetic associations with inflammatory bowel diseases (ATG16L1, IRGM1, NOD2, XBP1, LRRK2, ULK1, PTPN2). There was slight upregulation of IRGM1, FIP200, and ATG04A (P < 0.05), but no variations with the other 25 genes. In contrast, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that AA downregulated 74 gene sets (associated with 28 autophagy genes) while upregulating only 5 (false discovery rate <5%; P < 0.001) gene sets. Additionally, 22 gene sets associated with the 7 autophagy + inflammatory bowel disease-associated genes were downregulated by AA, whereas only 3 were upregulated. The genes with maximum AA-induced gene set suppression were VPS15, LAMP2, LC3A, XBP1, and ULK1.


CONCLUSIONS
AA induces profound autophagy suppression in the distal colon. The AA-induced upregulation of individual genes (IRGM1, FIP200, ATG04A) could be a reflection of complex compensatory changes or the initial abnormality that led to the pronounced autophagy suppression. Autophagy suppression by AA may induce lesser antigen processing, leading to lesser cross-reactive immunity between microbes and self-antigens, and subsequent amelioration of colitis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rajkumar Cheluvappa"", ids = ""4449185""); list(name = ""Annie S Luo"", ids = ""13005359""); list(name = ""Michael C.

c3e30b13186c1250137289396b2f955fa3c073d7,Transcriptome Analysis and Snp Marker Identification of Finger Millet (Eleusine Coracana (L.) Gaertn) at Critical Stages of Striga (Striga Hermonthica) Infestation,"Finger millet is a highly nutritious annual cereal crop in the semi-arid tropics of the world. However, its yield potential has not been achieved in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to deleterious biotic stresses such as Striga hermonthica. The survival of Striga on finger millet depends on a complex host-parasite interaction that is defined by three critical infestation time points, 3 daysâ€˜ post-inoculation (dpi), 5-dpi and 7-dpi. In this study, the transcriptome of tolerant (GuluE and IE2396) and susceptible (White Sel6 and IE2459) finger millet accessions were analysed upon infecting with Striga, to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in Striga tolerance or susceptibility at the critical time points. Roots of finger millet seedlings were infected with Striga seeds and samples collected after 3, 5 and 7 dpi. Total RNA was extracted from the young seedlings, synthesized to cDNA libraries and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Although, observable Striga germination commenced at 2 dpi, there were significant differences (mean Â± standard error) among the accessions in terms of haustoria development and Striga attachment at 3 dpi and 9 dpi, respectively. At 3 dpi IE2396 (6.583 Â± 0.7488) had the lowest number of Striga attachment, when compared to GuluE (8.75 Â± 0.5171), IE2459 (9.667 Â± 0.2465) and White Sel6 (9.4722 Â± 0.2222). At 9 dpi, susceptible IE2459 (2.306 Â± 0.314) was significantly different from GuluE (1.306 Â± 0.2312), IE2396 (0.25 Â± 0.1954) and White Sel6 (0.6944 Â± 0.1806). Differential expression analysis identified 407 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts (at least 4fold) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% in a pairwise comparison of all samples. A total of 33527 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 459 KEGG pathways were annotated at a cutoff e-value of 1e-5. Majority of the annotated transcripts were associated with signal transduction, hormone metabolism, cell wall development, mitochondrial electron transport/ATP synthesis and transport. An average of 1 SNP/153 bps, 1 SNP/160 bps, 1 SNP/358 bps and 1 SNP/189 bps bi-allelic non-homoeologous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in GuluE, IE2396, IE2459 and White Sel6, respectively. Finger millet accessions differ in their Striga tolerance regarding growth and yield. GuluE and IE2396 exhibited varying mechanisms of tolerance and escape to Striga infestation. Higher Striga infestation and differentially expressed transcripts observed in White Sel6 and IE2459 when compared to GuluE and IE2396 suggests higher Striga impact on susceptible accessions, especially at 5 dpi. SNP frequency doubling that was observed in GuluE confirms its wide geographical distance from the three other accessions. Genes involved in cell wall development, photosynthesis, signaling and transport should be studied and/or used for breeding in the tolerant accessions. The genes identified at critical stages of Striga infestation will inform key targeted breeding points for Striga tolerance in finger millet. Validation and introgression of these genes and SNP markers into farmer preferred varieties will, substantially, improve finger millet yields in the SSA.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Erick Owuor Mikwa"", ids = ""1441547373"")",,1c3b3227fc480f350e54a3f62a21b32346365b6d;

9cbb6474108e88ce7931dfb528410e61bac18428,High Dimensional Dependent Data Analysis for Neuroimaging.,"This dissertation contains three projects focusing on two major high-dimensional problems for dependent data, particularly neuroimaging data: multiple testing and estimation of large covariance/precision matrices. Project 1 focuses on the multiple testing problem. Traditional voxel-level false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures for neuroimaging data often ignore the spatial correlations among neighboring voxels, thus suffer from substantial loss of efficiency in reducing the false non-discovery rate. We extend the one-dimensional hidden Markov chain based local-significance-index procedure to three-dimensional hidden Markov random field (HMRF). To estimate model parameters, a generalized EM algorithm is proposed for maximizing the penalized likelihood. Simulations show increased efficiency of the proposed approach over commonly used FDR controlling procedures. We apply the method to the comparison between patients with mild cognitive impairment and normal controls in the ADNI FDG-PET imaging study. Project 2 considers estimating large covariance and precision matrices from temporally dependent observations, in particular, the resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data in brain functional connectivity studies. Existing work on large covariance and precision matrices is primarily for i.i.d. observations. The rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, however, are shown to have long-range memory. Assuming a polynomialdecay-dominated temporal dependence, we obtain convergence rates for the generalized thresholding estimation of covariance and correlation matrices, and for the constrained `1 minimization and the `1 penalized likelihood estimation of precision matrix.

However, the scale and systems affected by VK deficiency in pediatric populations remains unclear. We conducted a study of the plasma proteome of 500 Nepalese children 6-8 years of age (male/female ratioâ€‰=â€‰0.99) to identify proteins associated with VK status. We measured the concentrations of plasma lipids and protein induced by VK absence-II (PIVKA-II) and correlated relative abundance of proteins quantified by mass spectrometry with PIVKA-II. VK deficiency (PIVKA-II>2â€‰Î¼g/L) was associated with a higher abundance of low-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations (p<0.01). Among 978 proteins observed in >10% of the children, five proteins were associated with PIVKA-II and seven proteins were differentially abundant between VK deficient versus sufficient children, including coagulation factor-II, hemoglobin, and vascular endothelial cadherin, passing a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10% (q<0.10). Among 27 proteins associated with PIVKA-II or VK deficiency at a less stringent FDR (q<0.20), a network comprised of hemoglobin subunits and erythrocyte anti-oxidative enzymes were highly and positively correlated each other (all r>0.7). Untargeted proteomics offers a novel systems approach to elucidating biological processes of coagulation, vascularization, and erythrocyte oxidative stress related to VK status. The results may help elucidate subclinical metabolic disturbances related to VK deficiency in populations.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sun Eun Lee"", ids = ""3671157""); list(name = ""Kerry J.

eb4de84ebab4df1d63c8982ef889eba81135ea5b,A prediction interval for a function-valued forecast model: Application to load forecasting,"Starting from the information contained in the shape of the load curves, we propose a flexible nonparametric function-valued forecast model called KWF (Kernel + Wavelet + Functional) that is well suited to the handling of nonstationary series. The predictor can be seen as a weighted average of the futures of past situations, where the weights increase with the similarity between the past situations and the actual one. In addition, this strategy also provides simultaneous predictions at multiple horizons. These weights induce a probability distribution that can be used to produce bootstrap pseudo predictions. Prediction intervals are then constructed after obtaining the corresponding bootstrap pseudo prediction residuals. We develop two propositions following the KWF strategy directly, and compare it to two alternative methods that arise from proposals by econometricians. The latter involve the construction of simultaneous prediction intervals using multiple comparison corrections through the control of the family-wise error (FWE) or the false discovery rate. Alternatively, such prediction intervals can be constructed by bootstrapping joint probability regions. In this work, we propose to obtain prediction intervals for the KWF model that are valid simultaneously for the H prediction horizons that correspond to the relevant path forecasts, making a connection between functional time series and the econometriciansâ€™ framework.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Anestis Antoniadis"", ids = ""2023581""); list(name = ""Xavier Brossat"", ids = ""3288650""); list(name = ""Jairo Cugliari"", ids = ""2042195""); list(name = ""Jean-Michel Poggi"", ids = ""145065048"")",e0a64bcf54947e1533b0b154251094cf3da782c0; 938d9f472a8a6a6969fa5b9da7e632e1f62ce4d4; 4299f87552eca458cab393ba3ce71ad93b089149; 1877168d12ea5d114295fb1f613e47854d76835d; 32b9c8c652bd931672d751131b8a49a8a27f704b; 6b91b09173b6c5c6021c5b3079ccbbad35953f73; 4ffbd6860cc2cada1f4c6c77ad3f9b6535c4b3cf,a21b89dcbd6aec1dcc35c90c6de1e6edf160d680; 7c9abb835a15d767a06dd6d2b14024f97bb1c058; cc28038f9be5a1911e7b967a0a3dcfdd6cf8ee9d; b1b886b393c91440ac0f05e915e4fd736c782256; e86e7a0f7075a16a4fbd1d33d0f5d34ed87e05c6; efa117786e2589c2368414b23515d4b751527e12; 76ddd1c7a541d4276da660b8f16927f39144da4f; fa1091c8d04b3ca9eaf35703aac12ca6c6d4c762; c2c288e554e1160a49e39fcb0c5b77ea74354aad; 066bc4dc8074d8f760403f12cafb97a170f23175; a86437687be86f2f9d8a36b172e6dfbcb9ec5298; 642a83d0942b3ef1aaef6d0ebddb7c3e9d00d4d1; bed8aa6c3ad8dff41a825e1f66984291ad66477c; 0b8b6a02fe5942e24d2ce6ea1e7d3a626a5ca34f; c106c17601226147c2db7a05b64bb146a1d8f6a0; 13a33954e08c3973a6f2362185a47ca997a78992; d5cbf1d4769cb3566c083d446046da6b9cb91a4f; 97ca67667182fb0975163e6df2d8f9f5feb8a6e9; c6bbf44bad2a90141fd295d38c09ad79e412d073; b218873bbfb0d14bfb9bf02ac61d453830c9b873; 3204c14d872728a6b9cd63f006c9e78e6475d8a7; fcd1d753fe00036d97f055b85331709957f64017; 14acae7d8c42e8605628c40839625b83dfeb7c44; f1e013439e69bf056027f0970332a9cb2200dd56,International Journal of Forecasting,32,939-947
aeb03e940eb2a819c1e91a8d8cba34564b78a919,Improved results in proteomics by use of local and peptide-class specific false discovery rates,"BackgroundProteomic protein identification results need to be compared across laboratories and platforms, and thus a reliable method is needed to estimate false discovery rates. The target-decoy strategy is a platform-independent and thus a prime candidate for standardized reporting of data. In its current usage based on global population parameters, the method does not utilize individual peptide scores optimally.ResultsHere we show that proteomic analyses largely benefit from using separate treatment of peptides matching to proteins alone or in groups based on locally estimated false discovery rates. Our implementation reduces the number of false positives and simultaneously increases the number of proteins identified. Importantly, single peptide identifications achieve defined confidence and the sequence coverage of proteins is optimized. As a result, we improve the number of proteins identified in a human serum analysis by 58% without compromising identification confidence.ConclusionWe show that proteins can reliably be identified with a single peptide and the sequence coverage for multi-peptide proteins can be increased when using an improved estimation of false discovery rates.",2008,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lau Sennels"", ids = ""47153846""); list(name = ""Jimi-Carlo Bukowski-Wills"", ids = ""1397649441""); list(name = ""Juri Rappsilber"", ids = ""2813740"")",4ee69be867b2431badfe937852f8914de4e0188b; 4afb14d961bfae10581e8c9684e7051046d80dbf; def72aba2da1595edf010008a3470ee3e10542b1; fa00dc96baf2cd9df47731a457391d711643c63b; 086bdded267ca53f337ec6762df6b6db9316d622; 91c78d0f1505b5213fdb0eb737fab1122dfc21dc; 338acd3690bf35f3f4948ad2e550a694c1a29808; ecb337f28f5e00f1731c0caf42ae6b181f1ef76e; d5615d12c93bacccc021d316eb80feeccc5a1890; b94888e9c0556cae0af3a7e6fd15372844e92390; 575cca0eafe6291b45d00896ef5e6086df8dc2c9; a5aa9103acf7f6f92dc0a7faf441df317d2ea049; 818e65688688c9e8d316e17a3edbc20d257f6276; 7801f40eb729138113cba6611a81faef93640854; 65dbff96ae07b89e8896862fba49bf63f7a46e39; 6cef2997d7f66f5f9ab964464662675c7dec0012; 137a73a83e1679ecd6672e662ede01e43bddf496; 733358d8eb160ccdcb04741b5551975778be5501; 592ea9a00688aac6e486f173e2f047438816c819; 223fbb5da4699bdc10e2bdb63d54ff0c16517daa; a36be38df3c552b241c990dc60bcc04ae1ba3826; eb68a18f779bec34ba71ce740ced66f3cefa2464; 8f48855e85a060c945e2356574f041c9a9312b90; f238f1cf90136f17d045b771a9dcebf1c818692b,6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 560463880942d2ec1b760ec386d8c0c7c6cd8dbe; 0abfd3e0288e6067d8076515f51210ac54adfb09; f390e53848813184a170766b4d6dcbcb4d1aaaee; 80d2fb61279866a0acbf796b667c9215989251c0; 6088ae4794d3ac35d3576ede803b9212662ba8bb; 6749b99ce6ff63bc2dff6613fd6042e9c552cd2a; 0d7ee3f200a044b594606c9067bbcd1638ec32e3; 2551f5f20953719f91d69344cd023d78ac591c4e; bfcb182ab9a363a92040b93dc17551fd3432a100; abb87df03afbab087a59c5ff24aabd3a0e194503; 33a280e4a5c427d5dcf5bb69a094eeed36b54e7d; 9b1b99a26926e11611a2f64fac9cec27cdb47dde; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; b32844c0c81d1d6552b825e818ba1c915dedc285; b6befcbd40dfdf3341ce5dd9e805f1b2a177cde4; 68d5610b0eab933543da3212a074c743c756a0a7; 48793da33eb98e14f8da2d35486eb68f31e14b6e; e6ff5a0111a42c5ea20f7ce9716024047cc694c4; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 3eae1dad37346c74062524bacd451dc7dbbe803d; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 35fcb8ccb4a2ffa1b72bf047e72ab7d34dbf38b0,BMC Bioinformatics,10,179 - 179
8a1c3df0b13a1ee9ee1a766b8eb7522845062751,Global gene expression profiles in skeletal muscle of monozygotic female twins discordant for hormone replacement therapy.,"Aging is accompanied by inexorable loss of muscle tissue. One of the underlying causes for this is the massive change in the hormonal milieu of the body. The role of a female sex steroid - estrogen - in these processes is frequently neglected, although the rapid decline in its production coincides with a steep deterioration in muscle performance. We recruited 54- to 62-year-old monozygotic female twin pairs discordant for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT, n=11 pairs; HRT use 7.3 Â± 3.7 years) from the Finnish Twin Cohort to investigate the association of long-term, estrogen-based HRT with skeletal muscle transcriptome. Pathway analysis of muscle transcript profiles revealed significant HRT-induced up-regulation of a biological process related to regulation of cell structure and down-regulation of processes concerning, for example, cell-matrix interactions, energy metabolism and utilization of nutrients (false discovery rate < 0.15). Lending clinical relevance to the findings, these processes explained a significant fraction of the differences observed in relative proportion of muscle within thigh and in muscle performance (R(2) =0.180-0.257, P=0.001-0.023). Although energy metabolism was affected through down-regulation of the transcripts related to succinate dehydrogenase complex in mitochondria, no differences were observed in mtDNA copy number or oxidative capacity per muscle cross section. In conclusion, long-term use of HRT was associated with subtle, but significant, differences in muscle transcript profiles. The better muscle composition and performance among the HRT users appeared to be orchestrated by improved regulatory actions on cytoskeleton, preservation of muscle quality via regulation of intramuscular extracellular matrix and a switch from glucose-oriented metabolism to utilization of fatty acids.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Paula H.

0469f4742eb153f6850d8ff7da04e5db6013664d,MiRNA-155 and miRNA-132 as potential diagnostic biomarkers for pulmonary tuberculosis: A preliminary study.,"In our study, we aimed to profile a panel microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and to illuminate the molecular mechanisms in the development of PTB. Firstly, gene expression profile of E-GEOD-49951 was downloaded from ArrayExpress database, and quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood method was utilized to identify statistical difference between miRNAs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-infected individuals and healthy subjects. Furthermore, in order to assess the performance of our methodology, random forest (RF) classification model was utilized to identify the top 10 miRNAs with better Area Under The Curve (AUC) using 10-fold cross-validation method. Additionally, Monte Carlo Cross-Validation was repeated 50 times to explore the best miRNAs. In order to learn more about the differentially-expressed miRNAs, the target genes of differentially-expressed miRNAs were retrieved from TargetScan database and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was used to screen out biological pathways where target genes were involved. After normalization, a total of 478 miRNAs with higher than 0.25-fold quantile average across all samples were required. Based on the differential expression analysis, 38 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified when the significance was set as false discovery rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.01. Among the top 10 differentially expressed miRNAs, miRNA-155 obtained a highest AUC value 0.976, showing a good performance between PTB and control groups. Similarly, miRNA-449a, miRNA-212 and miRNA-132 revealed also a good performance with AUC values 0.947, 0.931 and 0.930, respectively. Moreover, miRNA-155, miRNA-449a, miRNA-29b-1* and miRNA-132 appeared in 50, 49, 49 and 48 bootstraps. Thus, miRNA-155 and miRNA-132 might be important in the progression of PTB and thereby, might present potential signatures for diagnosis of PTB.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meng-Li Zheng"", ids = ""15386485""); list(name = ""Nai-kang Zhou"", ids = ""46772322""); list(name = ""Cheng-Hua Luo"", ids = ""4192021"")",3756ba7e4047f9b8c302a53987cde45bd953b1e7; 523bafab7da5fbcf5046b793e6e78e79ad707c22; 35f5c0e8cc1e9f782c687d5dac88d68f90dc4566; 2dcfa2100201d48728a6881dc0e8cafb036ed75a; 27307c58c6fed3d7808e29b07cfaa461972f7716,,Microbial pathogenesis,100,"

9088b03c860a03ee65b2050ef019dcac381b9f88,Genetic variants of gestational diabetes mellitus: a study of 112 SNPs among 8722 women in two independent populations,"Aims/hypothesisGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy that has substantial short- and long-term adverse health implications for women and their children. However, large-scale studies on genetic risk loci for GDM remain sparse.MethodsWe conducted a caseâ€“control study among 2636 women with GDM and 6086 non-GDM control women from the Nursesâ€™ Health Study II and the Danish National Birth Cohort. A total of 112 susceptibility genetic variants confirmed by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes were selected and measured. A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) was created based on variants that were significantly associated with risk of GDM after correcting for the false discovery rate.ResultsFor the first time, we identified eight variants associated with GDM, namely rs7957197 (HNF1A), rs10814916 (GLIS3), rs3802177 (SLC30A8), rs9379084 (RREB1), rs34872471 (TCF7L2), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs11787792 (GPSM1) and rs7041847 (GLIS3). In addition, we confirmed three variants, rs10830963 (MTNR1B), rs1387153 (MTNR1B) and rs4506565 (TCF7L2), that had previously been significantly associated with GDM risk. Furthermore, compared with participants in the first (lowest) quartile of weighted GRS based on these 11 SNPs, the ORs for GDM were 1.07 (95% CI 0.93, 1.22), 1.23 (95% CI 1.07, 1.41) and 1.53 (95% CI 1.34, 1.74) for participants in the second, third and fourth (highest) quartiles, respectively. The significant positive associations between the weighted GRS and risk of GDM persisted across most of the strata of major risk factors for GDM, including family history of type 2 diabetes, smoking status, BMI and age.Conclusions/interpretationIn this large-scale caseâ€“control study with women from two independent populations, eight novel GDM SNPs were identified.

2fce2561542d3c500ec9c79f81db957f331d789a,Gene transcription profile of the detached retina (An AOS Thesis).,"PURPOSE
Separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) yields many morphologic and functional consequences, including death of the photoreceptor cells, MÃ¼ller cell hypertrophy, and inner retinal rewiring. Many of these changes are due to the separation-induced activation of specific genes. In this work, we define the gene transcription profile within the retina as a function of time after detachment. We also define the early activation of kinases that might be responsible for the detachment-induced changes in gene transcription.


METHODS
Separation of the retina from the RPE was induced in Brown-Norway rats by the injection of 1% hyaluronic acid into the subretinal space. Retinas were harvested at 1, 7, and 28 days after separation. Gene transcription profiles for each time point were determined using the Affymetrix Rat 230A gene microarray chip. Transcription levels in detached retinas were compared to those of nondetached retinas with the BRB-ArrayTools Version 3.6.0 using a random variance analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Confirmation of the significant transcriptional changes for a subset of the genes was performed using microfluidic quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. Kinase activation was explored using Western blot analysis to look for early phosphorylation of any of the 3 main families of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK): the p38 family, the Janus kinase family, and the p42/p44 family.


RESULTS
Retinas separated from the RPE showed extensive alterations in their gene transcription profile. Many of these changes were initiated as early as 1 day after separation, with significant increases by 7 days. ANOVA analysis defined 144 genes that had significantly altered transcription levels as a function of time after separation when setting a false discovery rate at < or =0.1. Confirmatory RT-PCR was performed on 51 of these 144 genes. Differential transcription detected on the microarray chip was confirmed by qRT-PCR for all 51 genes. Western blot analysis showed that the p42/p44 family of MAPK was phosphorylated within 2 hours of retinal-RPE separation. This phosphorylation was detachment-induced and could be inhibited by specific inhibitors of MAPK phosphorylation.


CONCLUSIONS
Separation of the retina from the RPE induces significant alteration in the gene transcription profile within the retina. These profiles are not static, but change as a function of time after detachment. These gene transcription changes are preceded by the activation of the p42/p44 family of MAPK. This altered transcription may serve as the basis for many of the morphologic, biochemical, and functional changes seen within the detached retina.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""David N.

Background: Cervical cancer is a major public health problem worldwide. The etiological role of human papilloma virus (HPV) infections in cervical cancer is well established. However, HPV infection is insufficient to account for the development of cervical cancers because only 2 % of women infected with HPV eventually develop invasive carcinomas. We have therefore initiated a large scale sequencing effort to provide comprehensive data on the global landscape of genomic aberrations and HPV variants that contribute to cervical cancer. Methods: We have carried out comprehensive whole exome sequencing analyses on 120 tumor-normal paired samples from Mexico and Norway. We also carried out transcriptome and whole genome sequencing analyses on a subset of the patients (81 and 14 individuals respectively). Results: The aggregate mutation rate across the dataset was 3.8 per megabase (Mb), with the most common mutations being C to T/G in the Tp*C dinucleotide context, at a rate of 15 mutations per Mb. In all, 18,037 mutations were found across the entire dataset, including 11,536 missense, 984 nonsense, 4691 silent, 231 splice site, 32 translation start site mutations, as well 443 deletions and 142 insertions. MutSig analyses to identify genes that were mutated at statistically significant frequencies across our dataset revealed 11 genes to be recurrently mutated with a false discovery rate of q<0.1 after correction for multiple hypothesis testing (and RNASeq-based evidence of robust gene expression). The most significantly mutated genes encode for members of the PIK3CA/PTEN and RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathways, as well as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We have also uncovered novel patterns of HPV transcript abundance and sites of recurrent HPV integration in cell cycle related genes. In addition, our whole genome sequencing data suggests that HPV-negative p53-mutant tumors harbor high frequencies of genomic rearrangements. Conclusion: The comprehensive catalogue of genomic alterations provided by this project reveals potential novel therapeutic targets in cervical carcinomas. Our data also sets the stage for improving diagnostic and preventive strategies, especially in resource-limited settings with the highest incidence of cervical cancer.

caa08f487900b00a9a8696be612fa510fd644381,Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-Like Receptor Alleles Alter HIV Disease in Children,"BACKGROUND
HLA class I molecules are ligands for killer cell immunoglobin like receptors (KIR) that control the antiviral response of natural killer (NK) cells. However, the effects of KIR and HLA (KIR/HLA) alleles on HIV disease of children have not been studied.


METHODS
993 antiretroviral naÃ¯ve children with symptomatic HIV infection from PACTG protocols P152 and P300 were genotyped for KIR and HLA alleles using the Luminex platform. Linear regression was used to test the association between genotypes and baseline pre-ART HIV RNA, CD4+ lymphocyte count, and cognitive score, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity and study. The interaction between genetic markers and age was investigated. To account for multiple testing the false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at 0.05.


RESULTS
Children with the KIR2DS4*ALL FULL LENGTH (KIR2DS4*AFL) allele had higher CD4+ lymphocyte counts. Among children â‰¤2 years of age, the KIR2DS4*AFL was associated with lower plasma HIV RNA and higher cognitive index scores. KIR Cent2DS3/5_1 had lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts in children â‰¤2 years of age, while the presence of Tel1, Tel2DS4_2, Tel2DS4_4, Tel8, Tel2DS4_6 had higher CD4+ lymphocyte counts in all children. Presence of Cent2, Cent4 and Cent8 was associated with increased HIV RNA load in children â‰¤2 years. Presence of KIR3DL1+Bw4 was associated with higher CD4+ lymphocyte counts in all children. Among children >2 years old, KIR3DS1+Bw4-80I was associated with higher plasma HIV RNA, and Bw6/Bw6 was associated with lower plasma HIV RNA compared to children with KIR3DS1+Bw4-80I.


CONCLUSIONS
Presented data show for the first time that specific KIR alleles independently or combined with HLA ligands are associated with HIV RNA and CD4+ lymphocyte counts in infected, antiretroviral naive children; and many of these effect estimates appear to be age dependent. These data support a role for specific KIR alleles in HIV pathogenesis in children.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kumud K.

17a4e8e4db20da6de9218af92841b9fdcd6d74e8,"A Lipidomic Analysis of Docosahexaenoic Acid (22:6, Ï‰3) Mediated Attenuation of Western Diet Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Male Ldlr -/- Mice","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem worldwide. NAFLD ranges in severity from benign steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are strongly associated with NAFLD, and the western diet (WD) is a major contributor to the onset and progression of these chronic diseases. Our aim was to use a lipidomic approach to identify potential lipid mediators of diet-induced NASH. We previously used a preclinical mouse (low density lipoprotein receptor null mouse, Ldlr -/-) model to assess transcriptomic mechanisms linked to WD-induced NASH and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, Ï‰3)-mediated remission of NASH. This report used livers from the previous study to carry out ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dynamic multi-reaction monitoring (HPLC-dMRM) to assess the impact of the WD and DHA on hepatic membrane lipid and oxylipin composition, respectively. Feeding mice the WD increased hepatic saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4, Ï‰6) in membrane lipids and suppressed Ï‰3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in membrane lipids and Ï‰3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory oxylipins. Supplementing the WD with DHA lowered hepatic ARA in membrane lipids and ARA-derived oxylipins and significantly increased hepatic DHA and its metabolites in membrane lipids, as well as C20-22 Ï‰3 PUFA-derived oxylipins. NASH markers of inflammation and fibrosis were inversely associated with hepatic C20-22 Ï‰3 PUFA-derived Cyp2C- and Cyp2J-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins (false discovery rate adjusted p-value; q â‰¤ 0.026). Our findings suggest that dietary DHA promoted partial remission of WD-induced NASH, at least in part, by lowering hepatic pro-inflammatory oxylipins derived from ARA and increasing hepatic anti-inflammatory oxylipins derived from C20-22 Ï‰3 PUFA.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Manuel GarcÃ­a-Jaramillo"", ids = ""1390166838""); list(name = ""Kelli A.

b6144617c6bb04efef7787d2c5d661e7d7e4b6ec,Multiple mechanisms limit the duration of wakefulness in Drosophila brain.,"The functions of sleep and what controls it remain unanswered biological questions. According to the two-process model, a circadian process and a homeostatic process interact to regulate sleep. While progress has been made in understanding the molecular and cellular functions of the circadian process, the mechanisms of the homeostatic process remain undiscovered. We use the recently established sleep model system organism Drosophila melanogaster to examine dynamic changes in gene expression during sleep and during prolonged wakefulness in the brain. Our experimental design controls for circadian processes by killing animals at three matched time points from the beginning of the consolidated rest period [Zeitgeber time (ZT) 14)] under two conditions, sleep deprived and spontaneously sleeping. Using ANOVA at a false discovery rate of 5%, we have identified 252 genes that were differentially expressed between sleep-deprived and control groups in the Drosophila brain. Using linear trends analysis, we have separated the significant differentially expressed genes into nine temporal expression patterns relative to a common anchor point (ZT 14). The most common expression pattern is a decrease during extended wakefulness but no change during spontaneous sleep (n = 114). Genes in this category were involved in protein production (n = 47), calcium homeostasis, and membrane excitability (n = 5). Multiple mechanisms, therefore, act to limit wakefulness. In addition, by studying the effects of the mechanical stimulus used in our deprivation studies during the period when the animals are predominantly active, we provide evidence for a previously unappreciated role for the Drosophila immune system in the brain response to stress.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John Edward Zimmerman"", ids = ""145308021""); list(name = ""Wendy Rizzo"", ids = ""144570459""); list(name = ""Keith R.

0cd947b1c0db56ae0ddc6db19d08569fdabd0829,Novel method to estimate the phenotypic variation explained by genome-wide association studies reveals large fraction of the missing heritability.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are conducted with the promise to discover novel genetic variants associated with diverse traits. For most traits, associated markers individually explain just a modest fraction of the phenotypic variation, but their number can well be in the hundreds. We developed a maximum likelihood method that allows us to infer the distribution of associated variants even when many of them were missed by chance. Compared to previous approaches, the novelty of our method is that it (a) does not require having an independent (unbiased) estimate of the effect sizes; (b) makes use of the complete distribution of P-values while allowing for the false discovery rate; (c) takes into account allelic heterogeneity and the SNP pruning strategy. We applied our method to the latest GWAS meta-analysis results of the GIANT consortium. It revealed that while the explained variance of genome-wide (GW) significant SNPs is around 1% for waist-hip ratio (WHR), the observed P-values provide evidence for the existence of variants explaining 10% (CI=[8.5-11.5%]) of the phenotypic variance in total. Similarly, the total explained variance likely to exist for height is estimated to be 29% (CI=[28-30%]), three times higher than what the observed GW significant SNPs give rise to. This methodology also enables us to predict the benefit of future GWA studies that aim to reveal more associated genetic markers via increased sample size.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""ZoltÃ¡n Kutalik"", ids = ""1813216""); list(name = ""John C.

f92440b1c12facafa2c2123864bcbd71389b0630,Habitual sleep duration and sleep duration variation are independently associated with body mass index,"Background:Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis and promoting health. Previous studies show that shorter sleep duration is associated with elevated body mass index (BMI) and other cardiovascular risk factors. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of habitual sleep duration and nightly sleep duration variation based on daily device-recorded data on BMI and obesity-related biomarkers.Methods:In all, 748 individuals (50.6% females, 85.4% European-Americans, average age: 49.7 years old) participated in a commercial lifestyle coaching program beginning in July 2015. Daily sleep data were recorded by Fitbit Charge HR wristbands. Clinical laboratory blood tests were measured up to three times over a 12-month period. Linear regression models were used for cross-sectional analyses, and generalized estimating equations for longitudinal analyses. All models were adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, season, genetic ancestry inferred from whole genome sequencing data, and BMI (if applicable). Multiple testing issues were corrected by false discovery rate.Results:We calculated habitual sleep duration and nightly sleep duration variation. In general, females slept 15-min longer on average than males. A negative correlation was found between habitual sleep duration and BMI (Î²=âˆ’1.12, standard error=0.25, P<0.001). Moreover, we identified a positive correlation between sleep duration variation and BMI (Î²=2.97, standard error=0.79, P<0.001) while controlling for sleep duration, indicating that larger sleep duration variation is significantly and independently associated with increased BMI.Conclusions:We explored the impact of habitual sleep duration and sleep duration variation, and identified that shorter habitual sleep duration and larger duration variation were independently associated with increased BMI.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaochuan Xu"", ids = ""25881159""); list(name = ""Matthew P.

We present the results of a small survey into the current practice of scenario analysis by simulation practitioners and academics. The results indicated that the range of scenarios used in DES studies may prohibit the use of FWER control methods such as the Bonferroni Correction referred to in DES textbooks. Furthermore, 80% of our sample were not familiar with any of the multiple comparison control procedures presented to them. We provide a practical example of the FDR in action and argue that it is preferable to employ FDR instead of no multiple comparison control in exploratory style studies.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kathryn Hoad"", ids = ""1837335""); list(name = ""Thomas Monks"", ids = ""1860261"")",63a040eb586680d1f17bf4822e903d82f9fc0b8b; 4ca6df75ff13919e324bf7be61d43c7338c8f51a; 09dd3579ce59157b3c3e45e28e89b87ea95640e5; 7d220eb9050e8b126760140d53ba2a71a7b7f6fe; 2ec87e6e52ec4eef2e154fc8c8b3a7727fc67f0c; 229f792c08e7a4977c6f2aacdbdc51cebd7b7927,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 0bd6e70ab6c2d131bbda7ef24d552709e6b6455b; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; e3c4df56a6cf32c789fb7f70f8d43a3a331498d3; 867f665b56e6a26a77823a054eb8048d5d3d0fa5; 5796c81a64d3ffec0cf7d9d79b092ea070db47f0; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 9f4041a2916d363f1f04cffa2dafe9b05375cfef,Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC),,3899-3909
da2a17df481bcdac092ef0fc58876b7341d3752b,Quantitative genomics of locomotor behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,"BackgroundLocomotion is an integral component of most animal behaviors, and many human health problems are associated with locomotor deficits. Locomotor behavior is a complex trait, with population variation attributable to many interacting loci with small effects that are sensitive to environmental conditions. However, the genetic basis of this complex behavior is largely uncharacterized.ResultsWe quantified locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in a large population of inbred lines derived from a single natural population, and derived replicated selection lines with different levels of locomotion. Estimates of broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.52 and 0.16, respectively, indicating substantial non-additive genetic variance for locomotor behavior. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,790 probe sets with different expression levels between the selection lines when pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of 0.001. The transcriptional responses to selection for locomotor, aggressive and mating behavior from the same base population were highly overlapping, but the magnitude of the expression differences between selection lines for increased and decreased levels of behavior was uncorrelated. We assessed the locomotor behavior of ten mutations in candidate genes with altered transcript abundance between selection lines, and identified seven novel genes affecting this trait.ConclusionExpression profiling of genetically divergent lines is an effective strategy for identifying genes affecting complex behaviors, and reveals that a large number of pleiotropic genes exhibit correlated transcriptional responses to multiple behaviors.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Katherine W Jordan"", ids = ""4040639""); list(name = ""Mary Anna Carbone"", ids = ""4522970""); list(name = ""Akihiko Yamamoto"", ids = ""49281139""); list(name = ""Theodore J.

Evaluation of the Genotoxic Potential of a Self-Inactivating |[gamma]|-Globin Lentiviral Vector,"The development of lymphoid leukemia in two children with X-SCID who underwent gene therapy appears to be partially due to activation of the LMO-2 proto-oncogene by the retroviral vector LTR (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., Science 302:415, 2003), underscoring the importance of vector design on the potential to activate genes near integration sites. In order to determine whether integrated, self-inactivating (SIN) globin lentiviral vectors which lack a viral LTR also have the potential to cause transcriptional activation, we initially compared the mobilization rate of an integrated SIN globin lentiviral vector containing Î²-globin locus enhancer elements with that of a SIN lentiviral vector containing the MSCV U3 LTR region. 293T cells were transduced to a high vector copy number with the SIN globin vector or a SIN lentiviral vector containing the LTR element, followed by transfection of viral packaging genes to rescue aberrantly transcribed vector genomes. Although both vectors had a comparable transducing titer (globin 2 Ã— 107 Â± 4 Ã— 106 TU/ml, n=4 vs. MSCV 4 Ã— 107 Â± 2 Ã— 106 TU/ml, n=9), the globin vector had a â€œmobilizedâ€ titer 60-fold less than that of the MSCV LTR vector (p<0.0001). We estimate that 1 in 300,000 globin vector integration events were mobilized, compared to a frequency of 1 in 12,000 with the MSCV vector, consistent with the possibility of less transcriptional activation attributable to the globin vector. To ascertain whether an integrated globin vector could influence endogenous transcriptional activity in red cell presursors, clonal spleen colony erythroblasts containing a single globin vector insertion were derived from transduced bone marrow cells of Î²-thalassemic mice. The transcriptional profile of 21 single-copy globin vector clones and 15 untransduced, control clones was determined using the Affymetrix Mouse 430A microarray (representing ~15,000 genes). Expression of 4500â€“6000 genes was observed in all samples. Using a 2-fold difference in the level of expression as a cutoff, only 0.02% of all the genes among the 21 clones had potentially different expression compared to the control clones, well below the expected 2% rate of random differences (Genomics 83:321, 2004). Ligation-mediated PCR was then used to clone the sequences of the vector-genomic DNA junctions, allowing identification of vector insertion locations using the NCBI database. Six clones had 16 genes, including N-ras, that were located within 100kb of the vector insertion site and were represented on the array. Of those genes that were expressed, only 2 had a 2.0â€“2.8-fold difference in signal value between the clone and the controls. These differences were unlikely to be real due to a high false discovery rate in those clones. Evaluation of these potential changes by real time RT-PCR is underway.

a8c9bc4299d05eb3ca8299a0dadaff037c3af52e,A Bayes factor approach with informative prior for rare genetic variant analysis from next generation sequencing data.,"The discovery of rare genetic variants through Next Generation Sequencing is a very challenging issue in the field of human genetics. We propose a novel region-based statistical approach based on a Bayes Factor (BF) to assess evidence of association between a set of rare variants (RVs) located on the same genomic region and a disease outcome in the context of case-control design. Marginal likelihoods are computed under the null and alternative hypotheses assuming a binomial distribution for the RV count in the region and a beta or mixture of Dirac and beta prior distribution for the probability of RV. We derive the theoretical null distribution of the BF under our prior setting and show that a Bayesian control of the False Discovery Rate (BFDR) can be obtained for genome-wide inference. Informative priors are introduced using prior evidence of association from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. We use our simulation program, sim1000G, to generate RV data similar to the 1,000 genomes sequencing project. Our simulation studies showed that the new BF statistic outperforms standard methods (SKAT, SKAT-O, Burden test) in case-control studies with moderate sample sizes and is equivalent to them under large sample size scenarios. Our real data application to a lung cancer case-control study found enrichment for RVs in known and novel cancer genes. It also suggests that using the BF with informative prior improves the overall gene discovery compared to the BF with non-informativeÂ prior. This article is protected by copyright.

5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22,Adaptive False Discovery Rate Control for Heterogeneous Data,"Efforts to develop more efficient multiple hypothesis testing procedures for false discovery rate (FDR) control have focused on incorporating an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses (such procedures are called adaptive) or exploiting heterogeneity across tests via some optimal weighting scheme. This paper combines these approaches using a weighted adaptive multiple decision function (WAMDF) framework. Optimal weights for a flexible random effects model are derived and a WAMDF that controls the FDR for arbitrary weighting schemes when test statistics are independent under the null hypotheses is given. Asymptotic and numerical assessment reveals that, under weak dependence, the proposed WAMDFs provide more efficient FDR control even if optimal weights are misspecified. The robustness and flexibility of the proposed methodology facilitates the development of more efficient, yet practical, FDR procedures for heterogeneous data. To illustrate, two different weighted adaptive FDR methods for heterogeneous sample sizes are developed and applied to data.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joshua D.

cce6d060b971128a178f21c2578fa6b93c06a068,Identification of biological themes in microarray data from a mouse heart development time series using,"Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to study gene expression during mouse heart development. Six timepoints from the E12 stage of embryonic development through 1 year old were examined with the AffymetrixÂ® GeneChipÂ® Mouse Genome U74A array. Data analysis using GeneSifter was performed to identify differentially regulated genes and distinct patterns of gene expression. The goal of this study is to determine the biological significance of the gene lists derived using these methods. ANOVA analysis, followed by adjustment of the raw p-values using the false discovery rate method of Benjamini and Hochberg, identified 1513 genes that showed significant differential regulation across the time series. PAM (partitioning around medoids) clustering separated these genes into two groups: one cluster contained genes showing down-regulation during the time series, the other cluster had genes showing up-regulation. Z-score analysis of the gene ontologies associated with the genes in each cluster identified distinct biological themes associated with each cluster: genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle were significantly overrepresented in the down-regulated cluster, while genes involved in immune response and energy pathways were significantly overrepresented in the up-regulated cluster. Introduction Microarrays offer the possibility of measuring the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes in parallel. Recently, several array manufactures have introduced whole genome chips for several model organisms. Advances in microarray technology, sample preparation, and the availability of skilled core facilities, have made the generation of high quality data routine in many settings. However, converting this data into meaningful biological knowledge still remains the primary challenge for many researchers. The steps required for this conversion can be broken down into three discrete sets of tasks: identification of significantly regulated genes, identification of global patterns of gene expression, and the determination of the biological meaning of both individual genes and groups of genes. The first two steps result in a gene list, while the third step deals with understanding the biology behind these gene lists. If experiments are performed with an adequate number of replicates, there are several standard comparative statistical tests available which will generate a list of genes whose differential expression is statistically significant (Draghici, 2002). Unsupervised clustering methods can then be used to identify patterns of gene expression among the differentially regulated genes. Although these steps are critical in the evaluation of microarray data, determining the biological significance of the genes identified is perhaps the most important step in the anlaysis of this type of data. This analysis is often done on a gene-by-gene basis using annotation supplied by genomic databases. Several challenges exist with this approach. First, a reliable source of gene annotation must be available. If the analysis is performed manually, it can be extremely time-consuming unless the number of genes in the gene list is limited in some way. However, by analyzing only a small subset of the data, the larger biological context is lost. Automation of microarray data analysis promises to overcome these difficulties and provide high-quality, meaningful information in a short period of time. GeneSifter combines statistical analysis tools with methods for gene expression pattern recognition. It then allows users to rapidly identify the significance of individual genes, as well as biological themes in sets of genes first identified by the statistical and pattern recognition methods. GeneSifter uses Gene Ontology (GO) Reports and z-scores to summarize the biological processes represented in a particular list. Z-scores can then be used to identify GO terms that are significantly overor under-represented in this list. This allows for rapid characterization of the broad biological themes affected in a particular experiment. This approach can be efficiently used for gene lists containing thousands of genes. This study outlines the use of these methods to identify biological themes associated with discrete expression patterns in a mouse heart development time series.

Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) is important in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), but gene-nutrient interactions in this relationship have not been comprehensively evaluated. We investigated whether folate modified the association of genetic variants of FOCM with CRC risk. Among 821 Caucasian case/control matched pairs in the Women's Health Initiative observational cohort (1993-2008), we genotyped 453 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 227 independent loci in 30 genes in FOCM pathways (AARS, ADH1B, ADH1C, BHMT, BHMT2, CBS, DHFR, DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, EHMT1, EHMT2, FOLH1, FOLR1, GGH, GNMT, MAT1A, MAT2B, MTHFD1, MTHFD2, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, PON1, PRDM2, SHMT1, SHMT2, SLC19A1, TCN2, and TYMS). Folate concentrations in plasma and red blood cell (RBC) were measured by radioassays. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios, and likelihood ratio tests were performed to test the differences in the associations of SNPs with CRC among plasma/RBC folate tertile categories. Nominal P-values were reported for non-synonymous and candidate SNPs. For tagSNPs, we used the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control false discovery rate (FDR) at the gene level. When comparing homozygous variants with wild-types, we observed higher risks of CRC associated with genetic variants in folate absorption and uptake in the presence of low (tertile 1) plasma folate concentrations: GGH (rs16930073, flanking 3â€²UTR, P-interaction=0.006), FOLH1 (rs10839236, intron, candidate, P=0.018; rs2299650, intron, P=0.016), and FOLR1 (rs651646, intron, P=0.021). In other FOCM pathways (methionine/S-adenosylmethionine reactions, vitamin B12 transport, and DNA methylation), plasma/RBC folate also modified important non-synonymous and candidate SNPs in relation to CRC risk: MTRR (C524T [p.S202L], P=0.045), CBS (rs1801181 [p.A360A], P=0.035), TCN2 (C776G [p.R232P], P=0.040), DNMT1 (A201G [p.I311L], P=0.016), DNMT3A (rs11695471 [intron 22 A>T], candidate, P=0.002), and DNMT3B (283T>C, 5â€² near gene, p=0.043). In addition, interactions with plasma/RBC folate were observed for several variants in paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an enzyme generating homocysteine from homocysteine thiolactone: p.L55M (P=0.021), rs8491 (3â€²UTR, P=0.037), rs854548 (3â€² near gene, P=0.033), rs854551 (3â€²UTR, P=0.045), and rs3917527 (intron, P=0.006). All significant interactions with tagSNPs remained as â€œnoteworthyâ€ at the FDR 25% level. In conclusion, our observations highlight the importance of folate status when investigating FOCM-related genetic influences on CRC risk in postmenopausal women.

1f24eba92d281676c6eb4021df422b3ebdc49416,Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci Underlying Circadian Light Sensitivity in Drosophila,"Despite the significant advance in our understanding of the molecular basis of light entrainment of the circadian clock in Drosophila, the underlying genetic architecture is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify loci associated with variation in circadian photosensitivity, which are important for the evolution of this trait. We have used complementary approaches that combined quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, complementation testing, and transcriptome profiling to dissect this variation. We identified a major QTL on chromosome 2, which was subsequently fine mapped using deficiency complementation mapping into 2 smaller regions spanning 139 genes, some of which are known to be involved in functions that have been previously implicated in light entrainment. Two genes implicated with the clock and located within that interval, timeless and cycle, failed to complement the QTL, indicating that alleles of these genes contribute to the variation in light response. Specifically, we find that the timeless s/ls polymorphism that has been previously shown to constitute a latitudinal cline in Europe is also segregating in our recombinant inbred lines and is contributing to the phenotypic variation in light sensitivity.

c835f083a547f3e248afae1c806694997c06357a,A Variant in the Osteoprotegerin Gene Is Associated with Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Results from a Candidate Gene Study,"OBJECTIVE
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have accelerated atherosclerosis, but there is limited information about the genetic contribution to atherosclerosis in this population. Therefore, we examined the association between selected genetic polymorphisms and coronary atherosclerosis in patients with RA.


METHODS
Genotypes for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 152 candidate genes linked with autoimmune or cardiovascular risk were measured in 140 patients with RA. The association between the presence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and SNP allele frequency was assessed by logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, and race. To adjust for multiple comparisons, a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold was set at 20%.


RESULTS
Patients with RA were 54Â±11 years old and predominantly Caucasian (89%) and female (69%). CAC was present in 70 patients (50%). A variant in rs2073618 that encodes an Asn3Lys missense substitution in the osteoprotegerin gene (OPG, TNFRSF11B) was significantly associated with the presence of CAC (OR=4.09, p<0.00026) and withstands FDR correction.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that a polymorphism of the TNFRSF11B gene, which encodes osteoprotegerin, is associated with the presence of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with RA.

139e4e9cd210113f5df077541231a58f35fa11e4,Serum Exosomal Micrornas as Clinical Biomarkers for the Detection of Barrettâ€™s Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma,"Background: Barrettâ€™s esophagus (BE), caused by Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), is the main premalignant condition for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The majority of BE and EAC patients are missed or diagnosed late resulting in dismal outcomes. Multiple studies have proposed serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as promising biomarkers for benign and malignant conditions. MicroRNAs contained in serum exosomes have increased stability and are a unique, non-invasive strategy for BE and EAC diagnosis. Methods: Serum from patients with GERD, BE and EAC (n=8 each) were differentially centrifuged to isolate exosomes. RNA was extracted with Trizol and next-generation sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 Sequencing platform. Analysis of the data was conducted using mirDeep2/EdgeR and prediction classification analysis. A False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: All subjects were white males with the following mean ages: GERD: 58Â±9 years; BE: 63Â±8 years; EAC: 64Â±3 years (p=0.3833). Comparison of serum exosomal miRNA profiles among the 3 groups found most significant differences between EAC patients compared to BE and GERD patients (79 and 85 miRNAs were found in EAC vs BE and GERD, respectively). Comparison of BE versus GERD patients found 17 differentially expressed serum exosomal miRNAs. Additionally, for each of the disease comparisons, approximately half of the significant miRNAs were up-regulated and the half were down-regulated. Prediction analysis identified a signature of 34 miRNAs that could be used to distinguish these conditions. Conclusion: We have identified promising candidate serum miRNAs for distinguishing GERD patients with and without BE and EAC. These findings need to be further validated to develop blood-based assays for clinical use.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jasmin Nwachokor"", ids = ""23701800"")",,60c1da5c39eb879890c55d740be8284168c3ecba; 26117d0804882a0c79a1326449d1cecee2ceaf2b; f7c6ddab3b0232167232b99e631b72c41163ecd2; 2d178660f4789cad7ce295ce7451c36fa27ea40d; fd3cb9016ac41091d0d38d9329933a3f7c9ebfa7; 6c50475ce4d963da3eb95603e492e694215b9a99; cb8a4c244c57cebb594786900a83180ccd665da1; bd801ea1edd30cb98ec3a99dbea746ca8457fbc2; 1817fe9a8d604199663fbd3cb49447d280be468f; e0f214e7ec8d76efb4e2cfb14fed0c67ab1da543; 6c57cfd886ce2e832f5376debbee1f963a42325f; d436dcd9b23038905fd834d28eb81ec4399ce3de; a2ce4fb7e269fc36a4fb0c2d986121c90456778a; c7497d6d32d3dd6f893609a17848c807134e1cc4; bc4bb931a6054890079dbce2b75660ddc21c57cc; 4831724d70cacf062c92732d865c26b505606f54; bdf9aeac716995ffdfbb392ab0e6fd88bf759ddd; a7a3046291d81a340a988775df671effb835ad93; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 3309c989de94edb7e1947a41357b50778481f569; 89b53ce086c3a2967a66e1dd3c67bcdf1f4eaeb8; 0fde3ebd65f41cc2220446a0d79011fbdc2d37a3; 68561cb403ed36dcd017c1dddd2269bec5f052ac; eeb29fa50cbe1e0a3d16b54348a334d9c3892c16; 395af6c6f70bb121ed7a4758dc76deed28b6e561; 9f9de764a3d7fb329fc9c215aa00ee0f3db4cbca; 94bd5ab9ba86050808dab75966771520602c18b6; e3fd8f3d3bf137dffa98c3f3c0546ce710584edb; 1b28e6d0894c2265306095984d4d523dd3d7280d; 3509092a738ef3b3f4e3953eacb52f7fa6389f11; a1d622c352a9fe033f26d0d0d4cd9ec49d383933; 674e33a6d31ef9341da3dcca8125eaf883b45097; f8835f974310b161e3114a80c4b19aad1e5a2df2; 107e98602c1be84b1654d6a1b241b7c97a94c71f; 37cae00437f3d00a8aff2417fe6354137fc04999; 898e052294feff8cd302c483389f9d9c5e20f9d4; 118ac217ae4826e7f1d6cdd711c805fda05f6846; fe8908af43654ec6c7eba297809df03dd1f5ccf9; fb98d2858f0a5e01f7313605688047724ef20078; 7fc318502e79c1eeea2a94f19d684a2a9e4440fa; 1caed4ab1425e7edca7ec24f173406e413a62358; a89723073562b8456bafd0aab36bf6c339f1c062; 9ec038291faebf347723d79d71d63f3b0107280d; eaa17ced5c6c8a358126d99d1ea8cffcd1fce3fa; 8f2d3c358df1f112b0bb70805318acbbc13a91aa; e8639c65aa128d1073c98a2197b61fd0fd50c504; 7783a6112df4774308fde2a906c5b2c67b62a305; 690ea1804c14bb22be5d0fe72c5d1709f9bda1a3; 7daf395ef59bff15605ca50c5716c38195bb1eff; 2b329150a6166e8b2976e0683a5ef78ff1a17a6a; ce5a2bbcff28c832ea6581fbf11e48d1e47a5765; f2af5f6c901a7e1ed750f4a1b5dcd6c663b05a5f; e51eb9c751bc409bc1b5de1842336d4687ce6ce2,,,
88fe684902a1e40914ab5b45edbd0c74089527b0,Copy number polymorphisms in new HapMap III and Singapore populations,"Copy number variations can be identified using newer genotyping arrays with higher single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) density and copy number probes accompanied by newer algorithms. McCarroll et al. (2008) applied these to the HapMap II samples and identified 1316 copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). In our study, we applied the same approach to 859 samples from three Singapore populations and seven HapMap III populations. Approximately 50% of the 1291 autosomal CNPs were found to be polymorphic only in populations of non-African ancestry. Pairwise comparisons among the 10 populations showed substantial differences in the CNPs frequencies. Additionally, 698 CNPs showed significant differences with false discovery rate (FDR)<0.01 among the 10 populations and these loci overlap with known disease-associated or pharmacogenetic-related genes such as CFHR3 and CFHR1 (age related macular degeneration), GSTTI (metabolism of various carcinogenic compounds and cancers) and UGT2B17 (prostate cancer and graft-versus-host disease).

cb13cc74a9da6597974a858880569f77812ce658,Guest Editorial: Application and Development of Bioinformatics,"BIOINFORMATICS and Computational Biology comprises the application and development of data theoretical and analytical approaches, computational simulation methods, and mathematical modeling to the study of biological and biomedical systems. In this special section, five papers in their significantly extended versions were selected from the papers presented at the 10th Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC2012). These papers show recent research in bioinformatics and computational biology consisting of peptide identification, gene regulatory networks, protein interaction networks, and signal transduction cascades or pathways. These papers have shown great collaboration and conscientious thinking throughout the complex and challenging bioinformatics and computational biology experiments. In â€œQuickVina: Accelerating AutoDock Vina Using Gradient-Based Heuristics for Global Optimization,â€ Stephanus Daniel Handoko, Xuchang Ouyang, Chinh Tran To Su, Chee Keong Kwoh, and Yew Soon Ong studied accelerating autoDock Vina using gradient-based heuristics for global optimization. They proposed to further improve the local search algorithm of Vina by the prevention of some points from undergoing the local search. In â€œImproving X!Tandem on Peptide Identification from Mass Spectrometry by Self-Boosted Percolator,â€ Pengyi Yang, Jie Ma, Penghao Wang, Yunping Zhu, Bing B. Zhou, and Yee Hwa Yang studied improving X!Tandem on peptide identification from mass spectrometry by selfboosted percolator. They proposed a self-boosted percolator for postprocessing X!Tandem search results. They improved the performance through multiple boost runs, which enabled more PSM identifications without sacrificing false discovery rate (FDR). In â€œCEDER: Accurate Detection of Differentially Expressed Genes by Combining Significance of Exons Using RNA-Seq,â€ Lin Wan and Fengzhu Sun learned of an accurate detection of differentially expressed genes by combining the significance of exons using RNA-Seq, widely used in transcriptiome studies and the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two classes of individuals. They proposed developing a novel program, termed CEDER, to detect DEGs accurately. In â€œHow Little Do We Actually Know? On the Size of Gene Regulatory Networks,â€ Richard RÃ¶ttger, Ulrich RÃ¼ckert, Jan Taubert, and Jan Baumbach studied the size of gene regulatory networks. They proposed predicting the sizes of the whole-organizing regulatory networks of seven species. It was concluded that they had lacked substantial understanding of fundamental molecular control mechanism on a large scale. In â€œA Comparative Assessment of Ranking Accuracies of Conventional and Machine-Learning-Based Scoring Functions for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction,â€ Hossam M. Ashtawy and Nihar R. Mahapatra proposed exploring a range of novel SFs, employing different machine-learning approaches in conjunction with a variety of physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes. SFs, which has a limited ranking accuracy, has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery.",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen"", ids = ""12650221"")",,,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,9 5,"

618a9b4b73ff6d087fdccea2a1a850a38152e2e5,FDR control by the BH procedure for two-sided correlated tests with implications to gene expression data analysis.,"The multiple testing problem attributed to gene expression analysis is challenging not only by its size, but also by possible dependence between the expression levels of different genes resulting from coregulations of the genes. Furthermore, the measurement errors of these expression levels may be dependent as well since they are subjected to several technical factors. Multiple testing of such data faces the challenge of correlated test statistics. In such a case, the control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) is not straightforward, and thus demands new approaches and solutions that will address multiplicity while accounting for this dependency. This paper investigates the effects of dependency between bormal test statistics on FDR control in two-sided testing, using the linear step-up procedure (BH) of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The case of two multiple hypotheses is examined first. A simulation study offers primary insight into the behavior of the FDR subjected to different levels of correlation and distance between null and alternative means. A theoretical analysis follows in order to obtain explicit upper bounds to the FDR. These results are then extended to more than two multiple tests, thereby offering a better perspective on the effect of the proportion of false null hypotheses, as well as the structure of the test statistics correlation matrix. An example from gene expression data analysis is presented.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Anat Reiner-Benaim"", ids = ""1420194205"")",ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; ec878c2e97ca94bc36496a111039b50827685b29; 7882b667d6e506db4c99d6c39990e3eb5b7d2119; 22390daaa1d9c1d3e9462d06c2caf8295a464ebe; 6fb51cc4ee63a869068617f87b36060ecb3e5701; d0686c1edd5b143758a6e567d929eb00fda4eb3c; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; deab750c3e2b55c222289146de718b87dfd671ec; 44c800503bbc410a2b0983f037db6a86402716b2; 3c2b103dcd02c0ebfd31c9f1e6fb2f797249833a; d385eadf84bc1ec6233d6ebe867c3b5f15681622; cb9f6f5fae553d372dbcefecb2535b8caca9d0c5; 05f19eb0f473b177af7c47d589699da91026764f; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 004e788613e6b225077ff0e65c705a913b8bd002; 4b0303d655ed229e9b20ed66970e61e0c206c01b; 2e17a65185c0822af6d1b2a81527f6e2906609aa; 4714548b587f976640e0ef4eefe0e974f28988c0; ef5791f90d593dec6732e9e8234788b37818ef2c; f99f6c6e1f3391a07be9b2878eac4522ec9df46e; cc47e1d24901ef802122238f70fc3af4c3987a61; e3159d253d3dc7497604a54f1a907afddbae2fee; afe747abd42f19a646394f4931417532d5eb1017; cbaf16ebba072cffe5e2a1f4e34d137e4b7eab6e; a5365562978a77e4ebd175992be19e9196eb008e; d6acd62ef4163388c36d2d0a95573b6135aef172; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; e99d0464004c78337956bd4328f9aee8193f54c5; f831e51da4aea50ff798cb4dde6c3359f2b745c9; 313d1352079a1ee39442de3c3a3f567040a40c2b; 5810bbfb69cf962b10c6d4223b7546469e55f893; d30280330eec7cbf81e151ee078326d83397c495; 23d1c0ad7fe110d7b758aced6be52f521b852519; 1e80aca43cb7c4176a93dd899da33eb9c77ccaf4; 89b5b05c02acb803ac22f9787a6702765d2d4547; 133331417f139546f310764ff6a35605548a435e; bfdb129552d17e728de5d7443b977d8b89fccdf9; 3576f0a087bc3adacd61d4eff0535cc5afd7128f; 3a9f833f0419c67ebe19d6fd9fc767759f14c20f; 93f9e6f7b86a0ad0d8534814f9b92377ca7c03d7; ad073216c42a700a142932981b325c29110ab5cd; 15b4192d8024b0ef6db4d82ae131289e6e36b701; 171ba44f4384e41d32036b99ff62e68e85c59d48; f19df596878aedeef53cc0bcccd2a49dfdf7bde9; 5480200c52b140fa77073c5c1c606631e277b612; 024a14daaad666e95e1324ba004660edb311794c; a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78; d96ed3422070146e93e6316fef4b8c5a5d7492aa; b8f14a3dfa4d4d72b3bb0fdfb617db5b95f09405; fe247463b9428bdb7efd5ebd50df4d6e77741a5d; 61b608a94ba9452d56b5d52bf2533d39405e05bb; fa3540d0028557fc553c7efe377254e52e56776e; accfc4bbd6da467e228c752faf0e3e1d9c17f519; c9cb8db57388a15fe988d4e4c21e8c2c41b1fe1e; 5bee62542393c9c31e13af9323ec1f2039cf4284; 4f6fc3c916534c30b4192a30455bfa317e2150d3; ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0; c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; 80c77bffec4e3a3da38dd4993e524597514d61c1; 5043fd247ee67d229bfb656264d634abc44518f7; 4ddb243e822fd85d5b707dddded7ac84b9d164ce; aa9fd7263bb1c65b0ddb4a2a02cec678cd442410; 8ec91aab73ee998ad94204f0d6ef5775851bd74c,,Biometrical journal.

When using the Famaâ€“French three factor (3F) model (with no market timing) we find that at most 0.5% of funds have truly positive alpha-performance and about 27% have truly negative-alpha performance. However, the use of the FDR in model selection implies inclusion of market timing variables and this results in a large increase in truly positive alpha funds. However, when we use a measure of â€œtotalâ€ performance, which includes the contribution of both security selection (alpha) and market timing, we obtain results similar to the 3F model.

Although PFUdA does not affect hatching success, many PFCs are known to impair post-hatch development and survival. Here we use microarrays to survey the transcriptional response of cultured chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEH) to PFUdA for potential targets of PFUdA action that could lead to developmental deficiencies in exposed birds. At 1 Î¼M and 10 Î¼M PFUdA significantly altered the expression of 346 and 676 transcripts, respectively (fold-change>1.5, p<0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). Using functional, pathway and interactome analysis we identified several potentially important targets of PFUdA exposure, including the suppression of the acute-phase response (APR). We then measured the expression of five APR genes, fibrinogen alpha (fga), fibrinogen gamma (fgg), thrombin (f2), plasminogen (plg), and protein C (proC), in the liver of chicken embryos exposed in ovo to PFUdA. The expression of fga, f2, and proC were down-regulated in embryo livers (100 or 1000 ng/g, p<0.1) as predicted from microarray analysis, whereas fibrinogen gamma (fgg) was up-regulated and plg was not significantly affected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CEH coupled with transcriptome analysis as an in vitro screening tool for identifying novel effects of toxicant exposure. Additionally, we identified APR suppression as a potentially important and environmentally relevant target of PFUdA. These findings suggest in ovo exposure of birds to PFUdA may lead to post-hatch developmental deficiencies, such as impaired inflammatory response.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jason M O'brien"", ids = ""1402693008""); list(name = ""Andrew Williams"", ids = ""145256918""); list(name = ""Carole L.

4f03a8aca9e08edfc92483c37346c9115e0d366f,Identifying amyloid pathologyâ€“related cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in a multicohort study,"INTRODUCTION
The dynamic range of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid Î² (AÎ²1-42) measurement does not parallel to cognitive changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitively normal (CN) subjects across different studies. Therefore, identifying novel proteins to characterize symptomatic AD samples is important.


METHODS
Proteins were profiled using a multianalyte platform by Rules Based Medicine (MAP-RBM). Due to underlying heterogeneity and unbalanced sample size, we combined subjects (344 AD and 325 CN) from three cohorts: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Penn Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research of the University of Pennsylvania, and Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis. We focused on samples whose cognitive and amyloid status was consistent. We performed linear regression (accounted for age, gender, number of APOE e4 alleles, and cohort variable) to identify amyloid-related proteins for symptomatic AD subjects in this largest ever CSF-based MAP-RBM study. ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to evaluate if these proteins were related to cognitive impairment changes as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE).


RESULTS
Seven proteins were significantly associated with AÎ²1-42 levels in the combined cohort (false discovery rate adjusted P < .05), of which lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), prolactin (PRL), resistin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have consistent direction of associations across every individual cohort. VEGF was strongly associated with MMSE scores, followed by pancreatic polypeptide and immunoglobulin A (IgA), suggesting they may be related to staging of AD.


DISCUSSION
Lp(a), PRL, IgA, and tissue factor/thromboplastin have never been reported for AD diagnosis in previous individual CSF-based MAP-RBM studies. Although some of our reported analytes are related to AD pathophysiology, others' roles in symptomatic AD samples worth further explorations.",2015,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Yuk Yee Leung"", ids = ""2798047""); list(name = ""Jon B.

Given the emerging association between the gut microbiota and IBS, this study examined potential effects of rifaximin on the gastrointestinal microbial community in patients with IBS-D. TARGET 3 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study. Patients with IBS-D initially received open-label rifaximin 550Â mg 3Â times daily (TID) for 2 weeks. Patients who responded to the initial treatment and then relapsed were randomised to receive 2 repeat courses of rifaximin 550Â mg TID or placebo for 2 weeks, with each course separated by 10 weeks. Stool samples were collected at the beginning and end of open-label treatment, at the beginning and end of the first double-blind treatment, and at the end of the study. As a secondary analysis to the TARGET 3 trial, the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota were assessed, from a random subset of patients, using variable 4 hypervariable region 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Samples from 103 patients were included. After open-label rifaximin treatment for 2 weeks, 7 taxa (e.g. Peptostreptococcaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae) had significantly lower relative abundance at a 10% false discovery rate threshold. The effects of rifaximin were generally short-term, as there was little evidence of significantly different changes in taxa relative abundance at the end of the study (up to 46 weeks) versus baseline. The results suggest that rifaximin has a modest, largely transient effect across a broad range of stool microbes. Future research may determine whether the taxa affected by rifaximin are causally linked to IBS-D. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier number: NCT01543178.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anthony A.

PCBs are categorized into two structural groups: coplanar and non-coplanar PCBs. The coplanar PCBs are dioxin-like potent toxic compounds. To evaluate their effects on humans, we chose a coplanar PCB77 for data analysis. We performed meta- analysis by integrating datasets via the Rank Product method, and identified 375 up- and 66 down- regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Notably, up-regulated genes were significantly associated with liver and kidney diseases. Using gene ontology enrichment, we found that the up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in the apoptotic process (false discovery rate, FDR=1.62e-10) and response to unfolded protein (FDR=7.65e-10). Protein-protein interaction networks identified the hub proteins containing HSP90AB1 and HSPA5. These findings suggest that our DEGs may provide a robust set of genetic markers for PCB77.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Junghyun Jung"", ids = ""50590239""); list(name = ""Kyoungyoung Hah"", ids = ""152741808""); list(name = ""Woosuk Lee"", ids = ""2860847""); list(name = ""Wonhee Jang"", ids = ""9732932"")",9f2f2c5844c97033df80c9ddfd9d0bc88d8965e2; 1232f1ab614e52f0271804a405a9e0377d8bd1b9; 7d4d45d943bf086a05331821da19514ae1a8f732,f653a349a68bd6ca0fa3ef171d64eaf39be545c0; 4516f15cb81e233d8506229c5caa15446eef60fd; 03ccd32949ddea560a6911a42bf7918278cd6e35; 88ba25d7cecd2b83bb1e5170a22ec11970254da7; a53bf1d878d61e165ca8283dcd8d992e16a8d02a; 3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70; da572cecb2151800f11474ebbc80160deed6a677; fd591c56cfffff68bf7ca5b623224e2466815644; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; dc29d734f06d9a0007e932b45f70704eb6ac044f; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 6d1e78b6f24f8abbef9998b9ace7b16ab50eb1af; b4789e02002be081aa9d4d57b4c132d9e67df1ad; 1065b3214053b17fde9d420970bc4c0c94b931b6; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; dd4ecad7ec6686561f23d46f5425904636fdf89b; da5d927f7636f65bf6bc1d297109abf2e68eda06; bc750521b674e9353eae18796ba8191385002332; a5e82ee0621f35bc3c1123dfbba32bad9932ef4d; 8428639581f068ea53b8569e855405740bd0c82a; b50b28491d9567892b8d5816c10ccb8ecb5bc684; 03e7f5081f73e5dd43bb02939e10b648fa8a91a8; e34c09165c0dc8499f5959154570c7763e1a1713; 6952e67c057554e83cd7566a65db098ec1caa51a; 2afb62827b708468857a436dc944087326b49eb4; cff2a58d0769a8b952c3c2efac1a32ffb9cbc251; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 13284497359c3ef32081c22068a0489d906eb5e1; 7286b5af10f663b75411c6f39728ee2dcf9a1f1e; d28ad681fb022432a07a9fa246a460d2381bf180; 446a8f12df3b0ed3c7f649e52d7b53b1ad3859f6; 6023a74568a5cbb14686a9931bf0aad7e31efee0; 895912f60ed28f0ad518a031b2be5af67426e826; 66be2db62d0a6ce292c3db9426875f3bafbedb1d; 4a9af0964dd649cd3a173cc51462913eb18fce94; 52125dd0e436a5fe3ced11587aa4f37a01c51a87; f07c4829d7aefd6eb082d059eb0b28e7bd64f31e; 03df6699fd20ad166521ed2bc5361ef7f033f274; 496d53e61eb93d925f774e6bb5c1476cf46d3033; d2d8f68535cd3599f08be350b4796383389d98e9; 2810851502a43c5b4fb960778a50ccafd5a30fc3; 5486b0dc4e3ac3b319781327a85ae2e2926236a9; 1c5762ed1a583c07d223af5d3f09bb61bc985198; cd050a4fbdbea4cc5108c6d5e847a212f0040b8a; 9d2f3bf4467ff203568ed1c2e239c0aa0d6b7495; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; f15747b3da2df9627328f70324ef0b2d8812d235; 14fb824219abec18a23c1af5f4def0d4cb7cf3f2,Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences,9,161-168
21cc0dc46fede2d75f35193e21a75764d5117f52,FASP: A machine learning approach to functional astrocyte phenotyping from time-lapse calcium imaging data,"We propose a machine learning approach to characterize the functional status of astrocytes, the most abundant cells in human brain, based on time-lapse Ca2+ imaging data. The interest in analyzing astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics is evoked by recent discoveries that astrocytes play proactive regulatory roles in neural information processing, and is enabled by recent technical advances in modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators. However, current analysis relies on eyeballing the time-lapse imaging data and manually drawing regions of interest, which not only limits the analysis throughput but also at risk to miss important information encoded in the big complex dynamic data. Thus, there is an increased demand to develop sophisticated tools to dissect Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes, which is challenging due to the complex nature of Ca2+ signaling and low signal to noise ratio. We develop Functional AStrocyte Phenotyping (FASP) to automatically detect functionally independent units (FIUs) and extract the corresponding characteristic curves in an integrated way.

6c2eadcfe534c279a4c635eef68c199497ae259c,Association of Urinary Metal Profiles with Altered Glucose Levels and Diabetes Risk: A Population-Based Study in China,"BACKGROUND
Elevated heavy metals and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were both associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, studies on the associations of heavy metals and essential elements with altered FPG and diabetes risk were limited or conflicting. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential associations of heavy metals and essential trace elements with FPG and diabetes risk among general Chinese population.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate the associations of urinary concentrations of 23 metals with FPG, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabetes among 2242 community-based Chinese adults in Wuhan. We used the false discovery rate (FDR) method to correct for multiple hypothesis tests.


RESULTS
After adjusting for potential confounders, urinary aluminum, titanium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, cadmium, antimony, barium, tungsten and lead were associated with altered FPG, IFG or diabetes risk (all P< 0.05); arsenic was only dose-dependently related to diabetes (P< 0.05). After additional adjustment for multiple testing, titanium, copper, zinc, selenium, rubidium, tungsten and lead were still significantly associated with one or more outcomes (all FDR-adjusted P< 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that multiple metals in urine are associated with FPG, IFG or diabetes risk. Because the cross-sectional design precludes inferences about causality, further prospective studies are warranted to validate our findings.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Feng"", ids = ""144316362"");

A false discovery rate of 5% and a fold change cut-off of 2 were used. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: Two up-regulated and 2 down-regulated genes were identified in calcified BAV compared to TAV. For the comparison BAV vs controls, 128 genes were differentially expressed including 80 genes up-regulated in BAV. Compared to controls, 42 genes were up-regulated in calcified TAV, while 21 genes were down-regulated. The genes differentially expressed between BAV and calcified TAV were significantly linked to pathways and functions related to AS development and progression including connective tissue disorders (p1â„4 2.09E-4 6.07E-4), inflammatory disease (p1â„42.09E-4 2.69E-2), and cell death and survival (p1â„43.17E-4 4.53E-2). CONCLUSION: The gene expression profiles of calcified BAV and TAV are highly similar. In contrast, aortic stenosis induced substantial changes in gene expression. The results of this study increased our understanding of the molecular basis of BAV and associated calcific stenosis. Expected outcomes are new therapeutic targets to prevent, slow the development or treat AS in patients with BAV.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sherin Ali Nawaito"", ids = ""79669626""); list(name = ""Bahira Hussein"", ids = ""6414602""); list(name = ""Yanfen Shi"", ids = ""4374253""); list(name = ""Marc-Antoine Gillis"", ids = ""89419307""); list(name = ""Matthias Gaestel"", ids = ""4310930""); list(name = ""Jean-Claude Tardif"", ids = ""143959656""); list(name = ""Bruce G.

f7c26693869cc072d00bd03aa9e49582cb1c12fc,Seasonal Variation in Human Gut Microbiome Composition,"The composition of the human gut microbiome is influenced by many environmental factors. Diet is thought to be one of the most important determinants, though we have limited understanding of the extent to which dietary fluctuations alter variation in the gut microbiome between individuals. In this study, we examined variation in gut microbiome composition between winter and summer over the course of one year in 60 members of a founder population, the Hutterites. Because of their communal lifestyle, Hutterite diets are similar across individuals and remarkably stable throughout the year, with the exception that fresh produce is primarily served during the summer and autumn months. Our data indicate that despite overall gut microbiome stability within individuals over time, there are consistent and significant population-wide shifts in microbiome composition across seasons. We found seasonal differences in both (i) the abundance of particular taxa (false discovery rate <0.05), including highly abundant phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and (ii) overall gut microbiome diversity (by Shannon diversity; P = 0.001). It is likely that the dietary fluctuations between seasons with respect to produce availability explain, at least in part, these differences in microbiome composition. For example, high levels of produce containing complex carbohydrates consumed during the summer months might explain increased abundance of Bacteroidetes, which contain complex carbohydrate digesters, and decreased levels of Actinobacteria, which have been negatively correlated to fiber content in food questionnaires. Our observations demonstrate the plastic nature of the human gut microbiome in response to variation in diet.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Emily R.

We propose FreeHi-C, a data-driven Hi-C simulator for simulating and augmenting Hi-C datasets. FreeHi-C employs a non-parametric strategy for estimating interaction distribution of genome fragments from a given sample and simulates Hi-C reads from interacting fragments. Data from FreeHi-C exhibit higher fidelity to the biological Hi-C data compared with other tools in its class. FreeHi-C not only enables benchmarking a wide range of Hi-C analysis methods but also boosts the precision and power of differential chromatin interaction detection methods while preserving false discovery rate control through data augmentation.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Ye Zheng"", ids = ""46323282""); list(name = ""SÃ¼ndÃ¼z KeleÈ\231"", ids = ""2488490"")",,fcec9d3217698186b001cf4c833635f190bb531a; d4ceca31b7f32cdc7c53ff6d93dcb270c4542185; 28a215515d10b0ccadef846c61894e2e8a4ff65a; 614860af82a54c3a0e1194050c4f418e317d6d6e; e6ea8e2219f5c914d22fe20c111db2f999f04e05; 3552fef8761aa06519ec2aaedecf98573515ce37; 7eeb75676664ddd76bfce6b07a4d80efd2c3b484; 4870fc7fdad70722cb833827294f117b50394a8e; 3a771dd40873131c4583896708fce0e2756dc4a5; b95d4aff1287a8c3f4bb78a659de9646059b36a5; 564e224da06efb083bb33c7e31288b201653a923; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 3cee093aafd0aa6256b106130eae6892b37d74e4; bb41d61938c4953e7377097937ef517d15842521; eb9a0cf8f006fa24eea5af405c7f088073e486a1; 1773b939a85a4b39170d6ed7bd23c1017a6d8866; b95c401804c13979e517ab553a509d626d01f380; 67c9f1804707ac11a02855c1fe84e9d6766ed7df; 6c028691e7b9cdf8255d5bc6b5fe0ab72b505702; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; 71b8227593abb54483d821552dd66d0c6451f7f2; ef3f722c720c3c701d590d1a93d597d694027a8d; a2e5cb4898ff903d425f096ecf9a82074a855c9b; 0dade66448a513114b43319a0dee5a2ebb50869d; 428ea572e04a2553c94cb4d71bb42f80394b3798; a7b828436e60b8b2e978463bce06864b0a2ee6bd; 7162b2582ce0f75564b4b290a2e205e58ed974b6; 01d0874c7f291d7e336d8126cb42fc26842a327e; 4915077d13f76a0261119be455603f809839d21d; 6e496c389795d7d426c31b171ddc8e1659e435bf; 06a2b47f5789f59d21974edfef0c22b05bd27131,bioRxiv,,
b7fe02cd289369eb412f95e4e73ce2f6f7c98dff,Mapping protein cross-links introduced by bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl glutarate in cellular extracts by peptide fragment fingerprinting from the human sequence database,"Knowledge of spatial proximity of amino acid residues obtained by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometric analysis provides information about protein folding, protein-protein interactions and topology of macromolecular assemblies. We show that the use of bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl glutarate to cross-link proximate lysine residues provides a solution for two major analytical problems of cross-link mapping by peptide fragment fingerprinting (PFF) from complex sequence databases, i.e. low abundance of proteasegenerating target peptides and lack of knowledge of the masses of linked peptides. Tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) reduces the azido group in cross-linked peptides to an amino group in competition with cleavage of an amide bond formed in the cross-link reaction. Reduction of the azido group to an amine group renders cross-link amide bonds also scissile by collision-induced dissociation, cleavage often occurring along with peptide bond cleavages. The relations between the sum of the masses of the cleavage products and the mass of the crosslinked peptide enables determination of the masses of candidate linked peptides with add of two software tools that support PFF from the entire human sequence database in single LC-MS/MS runs. We identified 272 intraprotein and 25 interprotein cross-links in a HeLa cell nuclear extract at a false discovery rate of 0.3%.

ccf80bfbc48eec32aeb9bc4fca3c3b8826d5b14c,Quantitative proteomic analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cells using 16O/18O labeling.,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) hold great promise for regenerative medicine as well as for investigations into the pathogenesis and treatment of various diseases. Understanding of key intracellular signaling pathways and protein targets that control development of iPSC from somatic cells is essential for designing new approaches to improve reprogramming efficiency. Here, we report the development and application of an integrated quantitative proteomics platform for investigating differences in protein expressions between mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and MEF-derived iPSC. This platform consists of 16O/18O labeling, multidimensional peptide separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and data analysis with UNiquant software. With this platform, a total of 2481 proteins were identified and quantified from the 16O/18O-labeled MEF-iPSC proteome mixtures with a false discovery rate of 0.01. Among them, 218 proteins were significantly upregulated, while 247 proteins were significantly downregulated in iPSC compared to MEF. Many nuclear proteins, including Hdac1, Dnmt1, Pcna, Ccnd1, Smarcc1, and subunits in DNA replication and RNA polymerase II complex, were found to be enhanced in iPSC. Protein network analysis revealed that Pcna functions as a hub orchestrating complicated mechanisms including DNA replication, epigenetic inheritance (Dnmt1), and chromatin remodeling (Smarcc1) to reprogram MEF and maintain stemness of iPSC.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xin Huang"", ids = ""47932618""); list(name = ""Changhai Tian"", ids = ""47549390""); list(name = ""Miao Liu"", ids = ""3584360""); list(name = ""Yongxiang Wang"", ids = ""49415526""); list(name = ""Aleksey V.

6d6d360bfab2ffe1d5863e1e6f27c08737712bbd,Differential proteomic analysis of endemic and sporadic Epstein-Barr virus-positive and negative Burkitt lymphoma.,"BACKGROUND
Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children worldwide and the most common paediatric malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa. The endemic (eBL) and sporadic (sBL) variants have distinct epidemiologic and virologic characteristics. Although gene expression studies have defined the transcriptional profiles of both, their proteomic signatures have not been studied.


METHODS
We compared the proteomic expression profiles using differential mass spectrometry-based isotope tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis of a cell line representing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ eBL, EBV+ and EBV- sBL, and EBV+/- normal B cells from healthy donors.


RESULTS
In total, there were 144 differentially expressed proteins with a statistically significant false discovery rate (FDR) of â©½0.2. Results revealed over-expression of specific proteins with well-established links to lymphomagenesis such as TUBB2C (FDR 0.05), UCHL1 (FDR 0.05) and HSP90AB1 (FDR 0.1). Distinct characteristics based upon the epidemiologic and virologic subtypes of BL were also identified. In sBL, PCNA (FDR 0.05) and SLC3A2 (FDR 0.1) were significantly over-expressed. In eBL, C1QBP (FDR 0.1) and ENO1 (FDR 0.25) were significantly over-expressed. Comparison of EBV+ to EBV- BL cell lines and B cells revealed significant over-expression of DDX3X (FDR 0.1). Proteins were validated using Western blot analysis.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest unique signal transduction pathways associated with EBV infection and epidemiological subtype of BL that may contribute to lymphomagenesis. These proteomic findings provide potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic links to BL.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nader Kim El-Mallawany"", ids = ""1397643672""); list(name = ""Nancy S.

d8c1b897e97f363e03b94c778cbb29584e6f6e7c,Changes in mild cognitive impairment and its subtypes as seen on diffusion tensor imaging.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have observed microstructural abnormalities in white matter regions in both Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this work was to examine the abnormalities in white matter and subcortical regions of MCI and its subtypes in a large, community-dwelling older aged cohort.


METHODS
A community-based sample of 396 individuals without dementia underwent medical assessment, neuropsychiatric testing, and neuroimaging. Of these, 158 subjects were classified as MCI and 238 as cognitively normal (controls) based on international MCI consensus criteria. Regional fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures were calculated from the DTI and compared between groups. The false discovery rate correction was applied for multiple testing.


RESULTS
Subjects with MCI did not have significant differences in FA compared with controls after correction for multiple testing, but had increased MD in the right putamen, right anterior limb of the internal capsule, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum, right posterior cingulate gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, and right and left corona radiata. When compared with controls, changes in left anterior cingulate, left superior frontal gyrus, and right corona radiata were associated with amnestic MCI (aMCI), whereas changes in the right putamen, right anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the right corona radiata were associated with non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). On logistic regression, the FA values in the left superior gyrus and MD values in the anterior cingulate distinguished aMCI from naMCI.


CONCLUSIONS
MCI is associated with changes in white matter and subcortical regions as seen on DTI. Changes in some anterior brain regions distinguish aMCI from naMCI.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Senthil Thillainadesan"", ids = ""6178780""); list(name = ""Wei Wen"", ids = ""145225263""); list(name = ""Lin Zhuang"", ids = ""143943603""); list(name = ""J D Crawford"", ids = ""34839161""); list(name = ""Nicole A.

1bf0eceeaf2cfadd0e12b174e3d172c7d92f7dde,An fMRI task for exploring memory effects of significant-other activation in social cognition,"A novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm for exploring the neurobiologic basis of a key aspect of social cognition was developed, adapted from Andersenâ€™s transference paradigm (Andersen & Chen, 2002). This paradigm captures the extent to which current memory in relation to a stranger is impacted by activated knowledge of a significant other (SO). Forty healthy young adult participants were seen for two separate sessions and misled to believe that the sessions were unrelated to one another. In the first, participants listed descriptive sentences for each of four different important people in their lives (SOs), chose 20 ""irrelevant"" adjectives about each from a list, and provided descriptive sentences about 80 famous individuals. In the second session, at least two months later, participants were shown 20 sentences about each of six different supposed strangers (â€œtargetsâ€). Unbeknownst to participants, two of the targets resembled SOs described by the participant in the initial session (â€œthe experimental targetsâ€), two resembled SOs described by a different participant (the ""yoked-control""), and two were constructed from a random assortment of sentences the participant listed about famous individuals (the ""no-representation control""). The participants were then shown 30 sentences about each target and asked to rate how likely it was that they were just exposed to each about that particular target. For targets resembling SOs, 10 of the 30 sentences (the â€œluresâ€) had, in fact, not been seen previously about the target, but were from the participantâ€™s own description of the pertinent SO. Therefore, participants should incorrectly rate these lures higher when the target resembled their own SO, as compared to the comparable lures in either control condition. Functional MRI images were collected during the entire second session using a GE Signa 3T whole body scanner. Individual and group level fMRI analyses were conducted using SPM8. Replicating Andersenâ€™s findings, the average memory recognition score was higher for the â€œluresâ€ in the SO condition (M =2.69; SD = .61) than for those in the yoked-control condition (M = 2.55; SD = .65), paired t (39) = 2.01, p = .05). In fMRI analyses, betas reflected the tendency of neural activity to increase when SO-relevant targets were presented during the learning phase and these were used to produce a second-level contrast map which showed significant differences in activation during the presentation of SO-resembling targets, in comparison with the yoked-control condition. Findings were significant at the level of p < .05 after correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. Neural activity in bilateral fusiform cortex and the superior frontal gyrus increased during SO activation, while neural activity in the subgenual ACC (sgACC) decreased. This paradigm is a powerful tool for exploring the neural basis of social cognition and may well prove useful in characterizing psychiatric disorders in a developmentally sophisticated way.

0b35e8970edab38c871e3924a70d38e71318af03,Covariation of the Incidence of Type 1 Diabetes with Country Characteristics Available in Public Databases,"BACKGROUND
The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in children varies dramatically between countries. Part of the explanation must be sought in environmental factors. Increasingly, public databases provide information on country-to-country environmental differences.


METHODS
Information on the incidence of T1D and country characteristics were searched for in the 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member countries. T1D incidence was extracted from a systematic literature review of all papers published between 1975 and 2014, including the 2013 update from the International Diabetes Federation. The information on country characteristics was searched in public databases. We considered all indicators with a plausible relation with T1D and those previously reported as correlated with T1D, and for which there was less than 5% missing values. This yielded 77 indicators. Four domains were explored: Climate and environment, Demography, Economy, and Health Conditions. Bonferroni correction to correct false discovery rate (FDR) was used in bivariate analyses. Stepwise multiple regressions, served to identify independent predictors of the geographical variation of T1D.


FINDINGS
T1D incidence was estimated for 80 WHO countries. Forty-one significant correlations between T1D and the selected indicators were found. Stepwise Multiple Linear Regressions performed in the four explored domains indicated that the percentages of variance explained by the indicators were respectively 35% for Climate and environment, 33% for Demography, 45% for Economy, and 46% for Health conditions, and 51% in the Final model, where all variables selected by domain were considered. Significant environmental predictors of the country-to-country variation of T1D incidence included UV radiation, number of mobile cellular subscriptions in the country, health expenditure per capita, hepatitis B immunization and mean body mass index (BMI).


CONCLUSIONS
The increasing availability of public databases providing information in all global environmental domains should allow new analyses to identify further geographical, behavioral, social and economic factors, or indicators that point to latent causal factors of T1D.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paula Andrea Diaz-Valencia"", ids = ""1405424236""); list(name = ""Pierre BougnÃ¨res"", ids = ""3984022""); list(name = ""Alain-Jacques Valleron"", ids = ""145138655"")",c7000bef49d0909db6c468e3b40650b1fa587a48; 53f2afc87fe5d418756f3924281fc0af6acbda61; 17adf3da97570ae20af9bfc2b77c9ffab4750802; 20843f3ec5f0b5e3575994ad3c6eab7e8b9b0226; 936021965e56b4f0e88f2d49ce5bcaa8f58210b0; d53b3e0b8d3f5ffddd6b45a1b96e808d893702f1; cc44d189d6d99f8ad78eb9e3b55bbd4278bef035,d151a0a11cbf16ecb137a68820c68e12d239c17c; 407999e9a6d6a53d1e0f1a0908b8027269a0a3da; 97a9a693d68f56eaa812afef4e2db2bef490a963; 0384f8989c6c5abec7276394e018ad9810f8524e; a2d8f8fb92cfa0c0f6cd6c86118b8c266d4603a2; b7fb43ecb32babc30be98f955b33461fc0b6b178; b94a9d7e7c29c2a22c9d0c48c00c817a653e8cf0; 90fb0dd32809cb1c857ce250fd87f2d835f3e93e; 0441436e9179def2d99bf31e281522b7386f0c5d; 2a67650232639a4075a9d77c19f6d4c47b4a411e; 7cbd640dd39f16806aed98c38a5adb7ea8c7f99c; dde47d3f907efdf17b143c375f6182d298796918; c94aa7b177de0eb9b5a6645e29dcf998b2f63356; db631313dca05d73bf157d55295f0705e7e7d390; acaed32791ba1befe97307b5fb1281102feb1577; f5d0867d1cb2b0fc07f4827d8915d7f253118431; f38ca84a0bc69e714e61b41941bccc657376290e; e737c661b63d87f38339824160c216d15409d515; 0575b34daf48d7de288ad3d9d92757a8ad75fa04; 35368469e672fdafac77d7b6e905378ae7b2d907; 1a7d5ca350ad4078a2131623f6f2e20684bceefc; 6f23fc4ffb85bf46f0b6c3f4e9d6fcc608b2e3f8; c804efaf10473f98eb99e693e8e0a58384405847; 890bf00272e6e0dff37a678998751c50b6f40a3f; 73e6ec1a10d1e8aa07d9403e6b81cc5647a4717b; 269dff21e1c7fc622e8381627b192467d4acce65; e459a252789f397d7bb67a83276024f0254c682a; 4eae30c07683b1abc3dc22ab6b89eb1aa51e0d5b; 16f479444a099ec2b1089eac318d08f5ac772325; 6e2c086ff3e97b319c97946e3e9bc9043da86cde; 1757421fbaf633c4292d3570db607234a0e31c53; 4b75a5d787e0971dd56e550a612dc2dea0132a40; d66f8203b02612291e330a1360d6537107d38834; 9eb17bdf02ffe5c7289450dafd16ad9b2007da47; 003725ce8610d3dcc97cdda6b1db8b8e538a901a; f05238b1dab554bb2327489d054add2ffbcc9647; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 13b2ef50e84d2bac1cd9854bf471148cfc524f87; d772a3de08c7ee81114589abf1cec35b8fc232c2; 2d3a0d817c71651a1129c93439c6de754be24bab; e17c936f3bb3fda5129a89f2c641edc52e46487b; ed92d8dd50f141589fb9b4160bc0b4faf9e98aeb; 15db35131c6ffeb3080d18118ae7f9b6e3d2185a,PLoS ONE,10,
d27d54f24032f8282e1e619bd87da985266451d9,Gene expression profiling for molecular distinction and characterization of laser captured primary lung cancers,"MethodsWe examined gene expression profiles of tumor cells from 29 untreated patients with lung cancer (10 adenocarcinomas (AC), 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 9 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)) in comparison to 5 samples of normal lung tissue (NT). The European and American methodological quality guidelines for microarray experiments were followed, including the stipulated use of laser capture microdissection for separation and purification of the lung cancer tumor cells from surrounding tissue.ResultsBased on differentially expressed genes, different lung cancer samples could be distinguished from each other and from normal lung tissue using hierarchical clustering. Comparing AC, SCC and SCLC with NT, we found 205, 335 and 404 genes, respectively, that were at least 2-fold differentially expressed (estimated false discovery rate: < 2.6%). Different lung cancer subtypes had distinct molecular phenotypes, which also reflected their biological characteristics. Differentially expressed genes in human lung tumors which may be of relevance in the respective lung cancer subtypes were corroborated by quantitative real-time PCR.Genetic programming (GP) was performed to construct a classifier for distinguishing between AC, SCC, SCLC, and NT. Forty genes, that could be used to correctly classify the tumor or NT samples, have been identified. In addition, all samples from an independent test set of 13 further tumors (AC or SCC) were also correctly classified.ConclusionThe data from this research identified potential candidate genes which could be used as the basis for the development of diagnostic tools and lung tumor type-specific targeted therapies.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Astrid Rohrbeck"", ids = ""47633805""); list(name = ""Judith Neukirchen"", ids = ""5998961""); list(name = ""Michael Rosskopf"", ids = ""4638285""); list(name = ""Guillermo G Pardillos"", ids = ""4006135""); list(name = ""Helene Geddert"", ids = ""6415766""); list(name = ""Andreas Schwalen"", ids = ""4222180""); list(name = ""Helmut Erich Gabbert"", ids = ""6781593""); list(name = ""Arndt von Haeseler"", ids = ""2540873""); list(name = ""Gerald Pitschke"", ids = ""6867527""); list(name = ""Matthias Schott"", ids = ""50421216""); list(name = ""Ralf Kronenwett"", ids = ""2346712""); list(name = ""Rainer Haas"", ids = ""145140837""); list(name = ""Ulrich-Peter Rohr"", ids = ""114961519"")",426e8045cd15ee5c6f5759b0ccd13e38d2a19ddd; f624fc2bcf0a84c57da5ad25820432016d3c18ea; 04457d511febe483916ef4a4b2168dfe578fcaf3; b9a6df416017e75bc85c6f00c0f90b5050d1d31e; 66d88b846cbbfd7c8b86fd8e76bfd3bf030476de; 640cd6d6f414db20c9dd9507aeb805aa90470050; 079862779f04eca25befefc679783a4082ec6df6; 87c4e47327b199d5d9bad0e876149e85a9c6b822; 5ca722b4acc7da9a96aaee1e704396aa887367ae; 468ac913fa7726dc7f6bb848ea8e82fa50f3f4d2; 96a28afa2ead11425fd2e994ebfa2e815518fff6; 9a7d1f32938ff0d3d1d574e742e1e051a3ab1309; 634814ddc672077f1ae7ab8a2616c62a00653f25; a4cc04b36227e73d7236b176cd52897286ddc840; c3978bcba9bf7bb68f187dc0cffe06b9bb4b18bf; 46700cd02062aada1048ce32fcd2dbcc2476f4e0; 444fceaa9cc9940d6307e9e969a29360be1a596e; f84eb9f73f616367060570c44c5faf7c58ca9f43; 0e7a8335cb94715c82f7a5661155557c4ac79165; ed9f1bef331d86cef6b88cdf73bbb06ea731a6bc; 25813bb9187cb5e1616ba4dfe7a9f416c8bb5239; 18599b261072130cd25a03625d717bf44536d548; c852ab2b0b72e1b4c567cf53747d6de92a2502ff; 2c8446c610e53a67c9a46a05ebb47090439a130a; a1a03c9f7eb1190bacd0b3dc3434c3db088fb1ba; 1109331256e1378e824882c01419294781335ac5; f2ed5afa25c2880047c8a2eaea3db2ef0c01567b; f25850e7a7d70c0eec34560b5cd6b2f4192249c5; a151a6a07c38de410411012daf9ad3e6950f8367; f571fef1bf89b5912c04cc74a1379ef2860bac74; 668af03d4add0250d2fb6e335b0ba3231a1c07ba; 0b5ca8769d0075409683ab4964db34cd0efcba34; a234a9bb456b9b0de6bda6052407bc3373bc2658; ab04a044a2e1aaee6c7fe75bdf97acc224d19703; c3f4817c841b4c13b18e488deed184203d2a0c62; bc19fa4bf72e33d0b7b5334e4cfe5415166169ba; 9103ae9f093f2c2c34e58fe21e0a2f2da753f669; 71db3509ce996d6d877f25836d82d45b3253bc23; 151d8deede3b7a12250737f920b077a383a7b8b1; d7bd8f6d65ebcd46e5a3336a945464473bde1561; 48818dc7395ea56c37f2d194f9e556c2bed7229e,2aee4f141587136391c12c12c87c6793070a627c; 530d3d0b4baeff3187aeb2d74c2ab8aebaafd365; f1426b8e8d5401a5be9ab34b831f3ca1adfc763b; 977d973ccafdf75347fd9a9d5a50682c96a8ac5b; 29ecef1184c417ecb090fbdd8cb01c105d6db2ea; 45bcaca2da6e6de991bbfd4c98020c21b248b94a; 2d8c3173a4123b20be0988098f8b6b09ea6beb9f; 8dd1382c11c35ee22db98027948ac7be26cf5b19; 7048234f05391b72db24667e480382dcb526d204; 3356f0b31b3d54a3d203f36d1c96d7adb7f36540; 2ee06e6bf686dd83a408fa1ed736d210bf47ed94; 48091a8efcb2d67446958e8e5afad6d94359fe9f; 99015cffdecaa58600198d44029565851fcc1b7f; d6d214b50edc3ee3e542a208a6c8bcff6c26bb5f; 58b17c196b788f211a8d9abbb0d00324ae3eedec; 15a0333b0eff35b5dd636a10b2f8406be7cb59a6; 17db01577eb05e29b331c74c92c152cc0869eccd; 373e8bdcd61de2ad0cb1c6cb9514bb533849bc41; 89fc85e3a1db629b79b5d04bd459f5f0110d8cd1; 88dfc18a824e469e29644a57637beedec68aaf6a; 1fe90a70b1d5629d6897ab398af40734e2db627c; db4196e141261b70877028f13c9fc0b96373c47f; 87c576d84ee84f9c6ad71f21c56c9c2180b9a7ff; d582a8d429598f4bc72b1d07f8165b063e218438; 6f8182d4b807f877a2e1102ffc95e4392d37a6d0; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; 3f9e057e6c233a198510022a93a32d925e805cb5; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 45e03bc05c9932cb5855bfd175337136d9fb91b3; 3f138d7b6d59eba5a79dd2663a88ee6078c216d5; 956b790dba4d2686e3f3f3e97e187140de0b35d8; e1d648b817a623dbd967f10276a15e5845c96d69; 3df90d8843ffe2aa9be36154153bc4bf1951674e; 360af7eebfb5671167edca53a6bcf99cb3f7a370; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 3fba0ab4eb045125a5c0e39fbcd089b0b6489cd5; 8e0effa37bdf8d04ac21a5aff842bf31b982bac1; 2d10d90d38013f49c41711d2d398f6e4f0bda45b; 66df279618f3fe8d7d215570061a0539470b158d; 94e7d29d23230f472dd8d444eb038aa67af3edd7; 3a6f831a7417fc24f772e5419490fa9d1381dfc0; 7a912f921aae3b1bee7efa9d65e83cf053f3b9e3; 87e82a0575830e4a99d0c49da4b46f8fc4e8b90c; 68fc4473ebf2e2489e2204952aaaf30c1567bd1b; 408f582ed88c661ef3fd8dd3bc918a5e60e033f0; 1ef84899fbd136a17d08cbaa4baded5c4997e8d6; 0c5b26b6dd58ca90ba2d5461c4f603e824748460; 7362afa50bb332f6beaba5992281ecff2f025518; 9e4f46af99c92906ece6df52083bb2dc7e850a2a; 5c04002a55c011ebcec4128c27f14d756d9ff169; 1ed80fe25d52ac0994afc87703dbd8f5d8c1dca1; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6,Journal of Translational Medicine,6,69 - 69

MiRNAs, small non-coding RNAs, can be involved in tumor evolution including regulation of angiogenesis and development of treatment resistance. Therefore, miRNAs can provide both prognostic and predictive information in different cancer entities. Patients and methods: A genome-wide miRNA profiling using high-throughput TaqManÂ® Array Human MicroRNA Cards enabling quantification of 754 unique human miRNAs was performed. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 60 patients treated with bevacizumab as first-line therapy at our institution were analyzed. Based on the median overall progression-free survival (PFS) patients were divided into a responder (G1) and a non-responder group (G2). Differentially expressed miRNAs were selected considering a more than two-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) Results: Overall median PFS was 9.3 months with a median PFS of 17.5 and 5.0 months in G1 and G2, respectively. Eight miRNAs (miR-19b-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-9-5p, miR-590-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-20a-5p) were significantly differentially expressed between these groups (FDR Conclusion: Twelve miRNAs in breast cancer tissue could be identified showing promising predictive value for bevacizumab-based therapy. Although these data need to be confirmed, differences in miRNA expression could help identifying patients with greater benefit from anti-VEGF agents.

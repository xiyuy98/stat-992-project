f11c54896807eba7833d378912411d05fb7a9ab5,Abstract P4-05-05: Molecular effects of initial core biopsies in neoadjuvant window studies,"Background A growing number of studies are assessing the effects of drugs on breast cancers by investigating the molecular changes in tumours between the initial core biopsy taken at diagnosis and the excision specimen removed at surgery 2-3 weeks later. It is imperative to know if molecular profiles of tumours change over time without treatment and to assess whether the core biopsy itself influences the molecular profile. This study aimed to investigate changes in molecular profiles of breast cancer between the initial core biopsy and the excision specimen in patients who had no intervening treatment. Methods 83 patients with paired fresh frozen tissue specimens from an initial diagnostic core biopsy and the later surgical excision biopsy have been studied. Following RNA extraction and processing, Illumina HT-12 BeadArrays were used for gene expression profiling. Samples were analysed for significant changes in gene expression and compared with a large dataset of patients treated with neoadjuvant letrozole. Results Analysis is on-going and results from all patients will be available by December 2013. Pairwise Rank Product analysis (false discovery rate 0.01) of the first 12 patients representing all subtypes of breast cancer (6 ER+, 4 HER2+, 2 triple negative) with a mean interval of 22.9 days (range 15 - 33 days) between specimens, identified 346 down regulated genes. Functional processes represented by these genes were; ribosomes, regulation of cell death and apoptosis, and protein complex biogenesis. Up-regulated processes (236 genes) included functions relating to regulation of transcription, mRNA processing/splicing and ECM remodelling. No consistent changes in a 60 gene immune signature were seen across these 12 patients. Integration of this dataset with a large letrozole-treated dataset, demonstrated that less than 1% of genes that changed on-treatment with letrozole, changed without treatment. Conclusions This is the largest study investigating molecular profiles of the same breast cancer sampled at different times. It has shown: Â· No consistent changes in expression of genes associated with wound healing and immune response 15-33 days after core biopsy Â· Stability of the genetic profile of individual tumours despite multiple biopsies Â· Stability in the genes that are changed by two weeks of treatment with daily letrozole. This study provides definitive evidence of the validity of preoperative or window of opportunity molecular studies and has major implications for investigating the effects of new therapeutic drugs.

c1a80b1e61c3812afcccb82359d89b65d1dd46c1,Different expression of fibrinopeptide A and related fragments in serum of type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy.,"Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM) is an autoimmune disease affecting about 0.12% of the world's population. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major long-term complication of both types of diabetes and retains a high human, social and economic cost. Thus, the identification of markers for the early detection of DN represents a relevant target of diabetic research. The present work is a pilot study focused on proteomic analysis of serum of controls (n=9), IDDM patients (n=10) and DN patients (n=4) by the ClinProt profiling technology based on mass spectrometry. This approach allowed to identify a pattern of peptides able to differentiate the studied populations with sensitivity and specificity close to 100%. Variance of the results allowed to estimate the sample size needed to keep the expected False Discovery Rate low. Moreover, three peptides differentially expressed in the serum of patients as compared to controls were identified by LC-ESI MS/MS as the whole fibrinopeptide A peptide and two of its fragments, respectively. The two fragments were under-expressed in diabetic patients, while Fibrinopeptide A was over-expressed, suggesting that anomalous turnover of Fibrinopeptide A could be involved in the pathogenesis of DN.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Erica Gianazza"", ids = ""48375913""); list(name = ""Veronica Mainini"", ids = ""1968158""); list(name = ""Giovanna Castoldi"", ids = ""49099338""); list(name = ""Clizia Chinello"", ids = ""3055017""); list(name = ""Gianpaolo Zerbini"", ids = ""3928611""); list(name = ""Carlo Nike Bianchi"", ids = ""33999815""); list(name = ""Carmen Galbusera"", ids = ""49837801""); list(name = ""Alessandra Stella"", ids = ""47350812""); list(name = ""Giacomo Mauri"", ids = ""102813451""); list(name = ""Italo Zoppis"", ids = ""1947730""); list(name = ""Fulvio Magni"", ids = ""2783872""); list(name = ""Marzia Galli Kienle"", ids = ""2998274"")",fb5aba88711f7116234d2f7e2a314b4cb6e97042; 6bc4b3003807d1cb59ad96cfe52da59c88acee30; a986ad9f8f87a60c793aa1066a202432d5f14188; 52cbe5c38923a7a33cde1fae16f854558c9e74e5; 768ea79f11e6e4f018e46b8787269c22bd4f2a3e; e02ea96dd560a594a8eda5790a9432e0a38f69c2; 256e22f88784a8a10b211ae32e75ca7b825a8d02; 74222b4c7b7f7a243ed4f13112713b04809cf8ea; 26013bd0272d241adfdd5894f293999ff563c687; 8b6bbfdf989a5524f38d26048c95ab45d078d68f; 0d1728505e17fec05964488448588d7ab0bb3554; 323779ac88450dfd9ad72ffb8900aab234c7b750; 65b1a598bf8c10879d34c2f48de1806bb1f2b294; 250bd525e499ce469d773a9f238724ffa30f1aa3; 0cf634eacf1eb55e9bdd788405a2c622931322a2,,Journal of proteomics,73 3,"

Noble (2015) 1 therefore urged researchers to remove irrelevant peptides from the database prior to searching to improve statistical power. We here however, argue that both the classical as well as Nobleâ€™s revised method produce suboptimal peptide identifications and have problems in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Instead, we show that searching for all expected peptides, and removing irrelevant peptides prior to FDR calculation results in more reliable identifications at controlled FDR level than the classical strategy that discards irrelevant peptides post FDR calculation, or than Nobleâ€™s strategy that discards irrelevant peptides prior to searching.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Adriaan Sticker"", ids = ""38839447""); list(name = ""Lennart Martens"", ids = ""145632158""); list(name = ""Lieven Clement"", ids = ""2443548"")",,e3f704375384d951cf06c84161524649b6eb6f17; 8cdd128e5b86cb42cf42885808c445e8fe55d131; 8c1eed72bb4c630e18c051b062dfab77e12eddb6; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79,bioRxiv,,

Electrophysiological Parameters of Selective Attention in Adolescents with a First Episode of Psychosis: a Comparison with Adhd,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference S226 Poster Session II brain structural (P=.14), neurophysiological (P=.54), and neurochemical (P=.22) alterations. The summary effect size for cardiometabolic alterations (g=0.23; CI:0.15â€“0.31) was significantly lower than neurochemical (P=.04), neurophysiological (P<.001) and brain structural alterations (P=.001). The overall summary effect sizes for non-CNS (g=0.58; CI:0.44â€“0.72) and CNS (g=0.50; CI:0.44â€“0.56) alterations were not significantly different (P=.28). Discussion: These data indicate that there are robust alterations in non-CNS systems in psychosis, and that these are broadly similar in magnitude to a range of CNS alterations, indicating that psychosis involves multiple organ systems to a comparable degree from onset. We consider three models that could account for these findings and discuss implications for future research and treatment. F19. TELOMERE SHORTENING IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH FIRST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS: A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP STUDY David Fraguas*,1, Sandra Recio2, Covadonga M. Diaz-Caneja2, Maria A. Blasco3, Ana Carolina MoisÃ©s3, Celso Arango2 1Hospital General Universitario Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n; 2Hospital General Universitario Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense; 3Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) Background: Short telomere length is a biomarker of cell oxidation and aging. Patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) have been reported to have shorter telomeres than healthy controls (HC), suggesting that there is a premature and accelerated cellular aging in FEP. However, there are not data on longitudinal changes of telomere length in people with FEP relative to HC. We present preliminary results on 1-year longitudinal changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) telomere length and the proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres in young people with FEP and HC. Methods: 16 young patients with FEP (43.8% female, mean age 17.9 years) and 21 young HC (61.9% female, mean age 16.6 years) were enrolled in the study. PBMCs telomere length and the proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres (i.e. <3kb) were determined using high-throughput quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (HT Q-FISH) at baseline (16 patients with FEP and 21 HC) and 12-month follow-up (4 patients with FEP and 4 HC). Results: At baseline, we did not find significant differences in telomere length nor in proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres between FEP patients and HC. During the one-year follow-up, we found a significantly greater loss of telomere length (p=0.019; explained variance=69.7%) and a non-significantly trend for greater increase in the proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres (p=0.097; explained variance=45.5%) in patients with FEP than in HC. Discussion: Telomere length changes during the first years of the illness can represent an early marker of accelerated cellular aging in patients with firstepisode psychosis. F20. SEX-SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CIRCUIT DIFFERENCES IN YOUTH WITH PSYCHOSIS SPECTRUM SYMPTOMS Grace Jacobs*,1, Stephanie Ameis1, Joseph Viviano2, Erin Dickie2, Anne Wheeler3, Sonja Stojanovski3, Aristotle Voineskos1 1University of Toronto, CAMH; 2CAMH; 3University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children Background: Functional connectivity differences in the cortico-thalamicstriatal-cortical (CTSC) circuit, as well as altered subcortical region volumes have been observed in schizophrenia. In this study, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used in a large child and youth sample aged 11â€“21 years (n=1134) including children with psychosis spectrum (PS) symptoms (n=312) to further understanding of these biomarkers in youth outside of high risk groups and with a wider range of symptom severity. Methods: Structural subregions of the thalamus and striatum were identified using the segmentation tool MAGeT Brain. Functional subregions were segmented based on functional connectivity with the 7 functional networks identified in Yeo et al, 2011. Average time series from functional subregions were correlated vertex-wide with cortical surfaces and Fisher Z transformed. FSLâ€™s PALM was used to examine differences and interactions between PS groups and sex. Age and in scanner motion (mean framewise displacement) were covaried for and a family wise error rate correction was applied. Structural subregion volume differences and interactions between PS groups and sex were investigated statistically using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with a false discovery rate of 5% correction for multiple testing. Age, intracranial volume, WRAT score and current medication use were covaried for. Results: Sex-specific differences between PS and non-PS youth in structural subregion volumes were seen in both the striatum and thalamus. There was a persistent pattern of increased volumes in girls with PS symptoms, but decreased volumes in boys with PS symptoms compared to non-PS youth in the bilateral posterior putamen of the striatum (F=9.26, pFDR=0.006), higher order thalamic bilateral pulvinar (F=9.85, pFDR=0.004), left medial dorsal nuclei (F=7.42, pFDR=0.01), as well as first order thalamic left ventral posterior nucleus (F=6.47, pFDR=0.02), medial geniculate nucleus (F=10.03, pFDR=0.004) and bilateral lateral geniculate nuclei (F=5.7, pFDR=0.03). However, both PS girls and boys had increased nucleus accumbens volumes (t=2.66, pFDR=0.02). Decreased functional connectivity was found in PS youth between a striatal subregion in the right posterior putamen (corresponding to the dorsal attention network) and occipital areas (pFWE=0.005). This pattern was found to be driven by differences in specifically PS boys and not PS girls (pFWE=0.004). Discussion: Multiple sex-specific structural differences between PS and non-PS youth were found in striatal and thalamic subregions. Hypoconnectivity between the striatal posterior putamen and occipital regions in PS boys overlap with structural increases in this subcortical volume in PS boys. Finding these early indicators is a key strategy to provide insight into neural mechanisms underlying the development of psychosis with the aim to improve and better target treatments. F21.

Given that behavioral symptoms differ, differential neurophysiological processes are likely to be underlying each disorder. Deficiencies in early auditory processing measured by event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the P300 amplitude and mismatch negativity are suggested to be biomarkers for schizophrenia.

da428e59ef977c645e14fc1b77471f8cf37db9d1,Transcriptomic gene profiling of porcine muscle tissue depending on histological properties.,"In pig, the histological profile of muscle tissue, especially the proportion of individual fiber types, is one of the main factors affecting meat quality properties. In the present research, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) by using next generation sequencing method was applied to estimate the whole gene expression profile of Longissimus lumborum muscle of pigs (Large White breed) differing in the percentage of two fiber types (slow-twitch (type I) fibers and fast-twitch glycolytic (type IIB) fibers). The RNA-seq approach allowed us to identify 355 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated as significant (false discovery rate-adjusted PÂ <Â 0.05) using three types of software: DESeq2, edgeR and baySeq. Detected genes and pathways deregulated in muscle depending on tissue microstructure were associated with: metabolic processes - 158 genes; cellular processes - 122; biological regulation - 62; localization - 51; and 35 genes with developmental processes. The DEGs were included in: PI3K-Akt; FoxO and MAPK signaling pathways, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, lysine degradation and insulin signaling pathway as well as mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways. These results highlight the mainly metabolic pathways related to glucose metabolism and contraction processes of muscle cells. Detection of genes involved in variation of fiber-type distribution will be useful in understanding of the genetic factors affecting muscle structure, metabolic process and indirectly, meat quality traits.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katarzyna Ropka-Molik"", ids = ""1398375853""); list(name = ""Anna Bereta"", ids = ""7954088""); list(name = ""Kacper Å»ukowski"", ids = ""49328943""); list(name = ""Katarzyna PiÃ³rkowska"", ids = ""3788157""); list(name = ""Artur Gurgul"", ids = ""89039839""); list(name = ""Grzegorz Å»ak"", ids = ""90375775"")",233b63168697f6257ae9bda6257b904a90eeb731; 6c67456631d7f0f603198b6e80419275a3d1597a,c65863e911609e35b87246c50f497276af95488f; 588e95662b6521182195be28d7e8b1b921cde137; 0b194eb9c790bd223c0ff31282a541dfce1fbc98; c9bee1a563a900d30bc34719a24b8ca7fe1c0f2a; 3cd684827e3681764d344ffd9cdabcf1b12c036b; da28288fce5ae859936498f302ec2ff25fc6b230; d1b3a0e464fb8e42888377a99a29510e4c521b7c; e5717225423d56db985437ab683580d4e97f3244; aa00edd12a30201d76769bad2a2010c4338bb026; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; aed688ffeb840bab615058e5a4529def0f6bb474; c84af39feb5f1c5603136298631ff065de8b0238; 0e278cf80b2b490a058f12f8078f4557a5683981; dc084025cd2a71ce582b8a6b951131baade6dc6c; e39d9b485c81f66951c4107eb511722b28360123; 15c090adbbe2343ab5a59eb4199b670f2a2ee4eb; 906ecdc4186265a5cb3a21f73c4d1b3f8a4f967e; 49ae5094933e9ad7a655fbff679ecc751448a049; 1a85ceed829df9cf6842245f73ed8e55bb700887; 0008f103aaafdcb08ff21f3a3b3c50fc18a1063a; 62c839cb54c55945d1d3a90bfdbed230bc4ab7f3; 154a458466057eca6f13412b896785ff1603ae7b; 5d35d1d17da0cf7ec6f5a7231bc7b62dfffb6fdf; b7dedf740c0c7273902266a99868ffe49a0e018e; 9f88a78d91657f8c5906bf5898d7f92142901c85; 8fc78760d0e744599864a2e4c2e583d8c629e5bf; 38f4d89de93d3614eccb44df3020b180f282a9ab; bb7f37a15b49123061ffb342adf6d55d605bbae2; 1b06476f7eec2d55c704b6fe87fe1fe3e908c294; e8c59bef9491cb11d20797b28ca30adb61c98f52; 12871f8dad4642ee45e6a6f8612de2382e70e7d3; ffc6bd19ff8d3738653c6281e8f4ea1c76d4f35e; caccb25f91deefaa817e2afc8b7bbada53d9d2b7; c65db71fa1c497f794a7e3df28287fe4271cc34b; ca529d939d35914a1e5336161860dc894fe7bfcd; bd5b99c21142b5574f4e98de4ec3f50c41830d15; 54ce351ac95760635a4f8955cd5a2ee0f4828504; ba11eff174692af583ad90a0df317601cc681d3e; d7507d2e8b97f5eba3100f9b06b6ca07c62b0352; e2e509b7c79f90abde0d598eb6ffdf275d08d942; ee900e0e88582cf8bbee9bcce3ad46506803d281; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 37169fd24f465d7f62e797cf76ed4e9cbfbe88f0; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; d50458c350897b517ac409a568b941e13f071e76,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,88 8,"

7acd1bfd252b100e55e54ab4d4585eab031bd1d4,The Roles of Genes in the Neuronal Migration and Neurite Outgrowth Network in Developmental Dyslexia: Single- and Multiple-Risk Genetic Variants,"Abnormal regulation of neural migration and neurite growth is thought to be an important feature of developmental dyslexia (DD). We investigated 16 genetic variants, selected by bioinformatics analyses, in six key genes in the neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth network in a Chinese population. We first observed that KIAA0319L rs28366021, KIAA0319 rs4504469, and DOCK4 rs2074130 were significantly associated with DD risk after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple comparisons (odds ratio (OR)â€‰=â€‰0.672, 95Â % confidence interval (CI)â€‰=â€‰0.505â€“0.894, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006; ORâ€‰=â€‰1.608, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰1.174â€“2.203, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.003; ORâ€‰=â€‰1.681, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰1.203â€“2.348, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). The following classification and regression tree (CART) analysis revealed a prediction value of gene-gene interactions among DOCK4 rs2074130, KIAA0319 rs4504469, DCDC2 rs2274305, and KIAA0319L rs28366021 variants. Compared with the lowest risk carriers of the combination of rs2074130 CC, rs4504469 CC, and rs2274305 GG genotype, individuals carrying the combined genotypes of rs2074130 CC, rs4504469 CT or TT, and rs28366021 GG had a significantly increased risk for DD (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.492, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰1.447â€“4.290, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001); individuals with the combination of rs2074130 CT or TT and rs28366021 GG genotype exhibited the highest risk for DD (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.770, 95Â % CIâ€‰=â€‰2.265â€“6.276, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000). A significant dose effect was observed among these four variants (P for trendâ€‰=â€‰0.000).

84571b4548ab70433458312a1645fae81c93ed59,Multiple Dependent Hypothesis Tests inGeographically Weighted Regression,"Geographically weighted regression (Fotheringham et al., 2002) is a method of modelling 
spatial variability in regression coefficients. The procedure yields a separate model for 
each spatial location in the study area with all models generated from the same data set 
using a differential weighting scheme. The weighting scheme, which allows for spatial 
variation in the model parameters, involves a bandwidth parameter which is usually deter- 
mined from the data using a cross-validation procedure. Part of the main output is a set 
of location-specific parameter estimates and associated 
t 
statistics which can be used to 
test hypotheses about individual model parameters. If there are 
n 
spatial locations and 
p 
parameters in each model, there will be up to 
np 
hypotheses to be tested which in most 
applications defines a very high order multiple inference problem. Solutions to problems 
of this type usually involve an adjustment to the decision rule for individual tests designed 
to contain the overall risk of mistaking chance variation for a genuine effect. An undesir- 
able by-product of achieving this control is a reduction in statistical power for individual 
tests, which may result in genuine effects going undetected. These two competing aspects 
of multiple inference have become known as the multiplicity problem. In this paper we 
develop a simple Bonferroni style adjustment for testing multiple hypotheses about GWR 
model coefficients. The adjustment takes advantage of the intrinsic dependency between 
local GWR models to contain the overall risk mentioned above, without the large sacrifice 
in power associated with the traditional Bonferroni correction. 
We illustrate this adjustment and a range of other corrective procedures on two data 
sets. The first models the determinants of educational attainment in the counties of Georgia 
USA. Using area based census data we examine the links between levels of educational 
attainment and four potential predictors: the proportion of elderly, the proportion who are 
foreign born, the proportion living below the poverty line and the proportion of ethnic 
blacks. The second model is a geographically weighted hedonic house price model based 
on individual mortgage records in Greater London in 1990. In both models we show how 
the various corrections can be used to guide the interpretation of the spatial variations in 
the parameter estimates. Finally we compare the statistical power of the proposed method 
with Bonferroni/Sidak corrections and those based on 
false discovery rate

194c53eecb4fc0b2d59f4e088fcf419eafeb9e63,Neuregulin signaling pathway in smoking behavior,"Understanding molecular processes that link comorbid traits such as addictions and mental disorders can provide novel therapeutic targets. Neuregulin signaling pathway (NSP) has previously been implicated in schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental disorder with high comorbidity to smoking. Using a Finnish twin family sample, we have previously detected association between nicotine dependence and ERBB4 (a neuregulin receptor), and linkage for smoking initiation at the ERBB4 locus on 2q33. Further, Neuregulin3 has recently been shown to associate with nicotine withdrawal in a behavioral mouse model. In this study, we scrutinized association and linkage between 15â€‰036 common, low frequency and rare genetic variants in 10 NSP genes and phenotypes encompassing smoking and alcohol use. Using the Finnish twin family sample (N=1998 from 740 families), we detected 66 variants (representing 23 LD blocks) significantly associated (false discovery rate P<0.05) with smoking initiation, nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal. We comprehensively annotated the associated variants using expression (eQTL) and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses in a Finnish population sample. Among the 66 variants, we identified 25 eQTLs (in NRG1 and ERBB4), 22 meQTLs (in NRG3, ERBB4 and PSENEN), a missense variant in NRG1 (rs113317778) and a splicing disruption variant in ERBB4 (rs13385826). Majority of the QTLs in blood were replicated in silico using publicly available databases, with additional QTLs observed in brain. In conclusion, our results support the involvement of NSP in smoking behavior but not in alcohol use and abuse, and disclose functional potential for 56 of the 66 associated single-nucleotide polymorphism.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rajat Gupta"", ids = ""49007228""); list(name = ""Beenish Qaiser"", ids = ""4904752""); list(name = ""Li Sheng He"", ids = ""39887223""); list(name = ""Tero Hiekkalinna"", ids = ""49397115""); list(name = ""Amanda B.

7b9757bf5186c38b3545b6e678e2dc3d0d6ae66e,Judicious Use of Multiple Hypothesis Tests,":â€‚When analyzing a table of statistical results, one must first decide whether adjustment of significance levels is appropriate. If the main goal is hypothesis generation or initial screening for potential conservation problems, then it may be appropriate to use the standard comparisonwise significance level to avoid Type II errors (not detecting real differences or trends). If the main goal is rigorous testing of a hypothesis, however, then an adjustment for multiple tests is needed. To control the familywise Type I error rate (the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis), sequential modifications of the standard Bonferroni method, such as Holm's method, will provide more statistical power than the standard Bonferroni method. Additional power may be achieved through procedures that control the false discovery rate (FDR) (the expected proportion of false positives among tests found to be significant). Holm's sequential Bonferroni method and two FDR-controlling procedures were applied to the results of multiple-regression analyses of the relationship between habitat variables and the abundance of 25 species of forest birds in Japan, and the FDR-controlling procedures provided considerably greater statistical power. 
 
 
 
 
Resumen:â€‚Al analizar una tabla de resultados estadisticos, primero se debe decidir si el ajuste de niveles de significancia es adecuado. Si la meta principal es la generacion de hipotesis o la seleccion inicial de problemas de conservacion potenciales, entonces puede ser apropiado utilizar el nivel de significancia estandar de comparacion para evitar errores de Tipo II (no detectar diferencias reales o tendencias). Sin embargo, si la meta principal es probar una hipotesis rigurosamente, entonces se requiere un ajuste para pruebas multiples. Para controlar la tasa error de Tipo I (la probabilidad de rechazar por lo menos a una hipotesis nula verdadera) modificaciones secuenciales del metodo Bonferroni estandar, como el metodo de Holm, proporcionaran mas poder estadistico que el metodo Bonferroni estandar. Se puede obtener poder adicional por medio de procedimientos que controlan la tasa de descubrimiento falso (la proporcion esperada de falsos positivos entre pruebas que resulta significativa). Se aplicaron el metodo Bonferroni secuencial de Holm y dos procedimientos de tasa de descubrimiento falso (TDF) a los resultados de analisis de regresion multiple de la relacion entre variables de habitat y abundancia de 25 especies de aves de bosque en Japon, y los procedimientos de control de TDF proporcionaron considerablemente mayor poder estadistico.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Paul Roback"", ids = ""4745965""); list(name = ""Robert A.

Serum samples from 51 DMD patients from a natural history study and 22 age-matched healthy volunteers were profiled using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for discovery of novel circulating serum metabolites associated with DMD. Fourteen metabolites were found significantly altered (1% false discovery rate) in their levels between DMD patients and healthy controls while adjusting for age and study site and allowing for an interaction between disease status and age. Increased metabolites included arginine, creatine and unknown compounds at m/z of 357 and 312 while decreased metabolites included creatinine, androgen derivatives and other unknown yet to be identified compounds. Furthermore, the creatine to creatinine ratio is significantly associated with disease progression in DMD patients. This ratio sharply increased with age in DMD patients while it decreased with age in healthy controls. Overall, this study yielded promising metabolic signatures that could prove useful to monitor DMD disease progression and response to therapies in the future.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simina M.

0434d5be100b0ffea86ddd58c73be4133acef92d,microRNA Expression in Women With and Without Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Matched for Body Mass Index,"Background: Despite several authors who have hypothesized that alterations of small noncoding RNAs (miR) are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), contrasting findings have been reported so far. Discrepancies in body mass index (BMI) levels may account for these differences; therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether miR differed in serum samples collected from age- and BMI-matched control and PCOS women. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, miR were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 29 women with anovulatory PCOS women and 29 control women who were in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle, from the local biobank. Results: One hundred seventy-six miR were detected, of which 15 miR passed the false discovery rate (FDR; p < 0.05) that differed between PCOS and control women. There was no association of the top 9 miR (p < 0.02) (miR-486-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-19b-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-19a-3p, miR-339-5p, miR-185-5p, miR-101-3p, miR-let-7i-5p) with BMI, androgen levels, insulin resistance, or antimullerian hormone (AMH) in either PCOS or normal women. Ingenuity pathway assessment showed the pathways were interrelated for abnormalities of the reproductive system. Conclusion: When the confounding influence of weight was accounted for, miR levels differed between anovulatory PCOS women and control women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Interestingly, the differing miR were associated with the pathways of reproductive abnormalities but did not associate with AMH or metabolic parameters.",2020,,"list(name = ""Alexandra E Butler"", ids = ""4069284""); list(name = ""Vimal Ramachandran"", ids = ""47249902""); list(name = ""Thozhukat Sathypalan"", ids = ""1661035361""); list(name = ""Rhiannon David"", ids = ""1490920602""); list(name = ""Nigel J.

dc06391a5a666d1f505b2d5317b6d0f3b5e2aa85,Expression of ERAP2 and LST1 is increased before start of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients with good clinical response to glucocorticoids.,"OBJECTIVES
Glucocorticoids (GC) remain a cornerstone of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy, although a third of patients do not respond adequately. In order to find potential predictors for clinical response, the gene expression profile of CD4+T-cells as important players in the pathogenesis of RA was analysed before pulse therapy with 1000 mg methylprednisolone.


METHODS
Patients were treated with 3x1000 mg methylprednisolone in 5 days; hereafter response was determined by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Before start of treatment, CD4+T-cells (and CD14+monocytes) were separated by MACS sorting. Labelled cRNA from CD4+T-cells from 5 responders and 5 non-responders was hybridised to Agilent 4x44K microarray chips and differentially expressed genes were identified via mixed-model analysis of variance based on permutation-based false discovery rates. Selected genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).


RESULTS
Four genes were significantly increased in CD4+T-cells of GC-responders; expression of ERAP2 (endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2), LST1 (leucocyte-specific transcript 1) and FAM26F (Family With Sequence Similarity 26, Member F) was confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR); their expression was inversely correlated with DAS28 at day 5 (LST1 and FAM26F p<0.05; ERAP2: p=0.07). Elevated expression of ERAP2 was also detected by qPCR in CD14+monocytes and after 24 hours in both cell types (all p<0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
The increased expression of ERAP2, LST1 and FAM26F in GC-responders before therapy warrants further investigation into their role as potential predictors for the response to GC, and in the inflammatory process of RA.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruth D.

551599b6d895c1bd6fc46889f08ee8e0a0f863af,Application of Mixture Models to Detect Differentially Expressed Genes,"An important and common problem in microarray experiments is the detection of genes that are differentially expressed in a given number of classes. As this problem concerns the selection of significant genes from a large pool of candidate genes, it needs to be carried out within the framework of multiple hypothesis testing. In this paper, we focus on the use of mixture models to handle the multiplicity issue. With this approach, a measure of the local FDR (false discovery rate) is provided for each gene. An attractive feature of the mixture model approach is that it provides a framework for the estimation of the prior probability that a gene is not differentially expressed, and this probability can subsequently be used in forming a decision rule. The rule can also be formed to take the false negative rate into account. We apply this approach to a well-known publicly available data set on breast cancer, and discuss our findings with reference to other approaches.",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Liat Ben-Tovim Jones"", ids = ""2006284""); list(name = ""Richard Bean"", ids = ""144125771""); list(name = ""Geoffrey J.

There is a well-recognized potential of protein expression profiling using the surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization technology for discovering biomarkers that can be applied in clinical diagnosis, prognosis and therapy prediction. The pre-processing of the raw data, however, is still problematic.


METHODS
We focus on the peak detection step, where the standard method is marked by poor specificity. Currently, scientists need to inspect individual spectra visually and laboriously in order to verify that spectral peaks identified by the standard method are real. Motivated by this multi-spectral process, we investigate an analytical approach-called RS for 'regions of significance'-that reduces the data to a single spectrum of F-statistics capturing significant variability between spectra. To account for multiple testing, we use a false discovery rate criterion for identifying potentially interesting proteins.


RESULTS
We show that RS has better operating characteristics than several existing methods and demonstrate routine applications on a number of large datasets.",2006,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chuen Seng Tan"", ids = ""49409304""); list(name = ""Alexander Ploner"", ids = ""47353253""); list(name = ""Andreas Quandt"", ids = ""34662447""); list(name = ""Janne LehtiÃ¶"", ids = ""2006594""); list(name = ""Yudi Pawitan"", ids = ""2445755"")",a8d981074edba8c0930061f40718e03c41a0c84d; 6f5fc0dba758ca0a67ed17706b514b0ee2de4fb7; b346385cd7cfd8876c24ad9988d139e9c657612b; d21a8c90bd8de20ba8867b7deb1a285a09e15ede; 22aa4791562d4f03427c99c2fdfdf2c477f634a7; ef429c3c4c841724883b084a066f7f49b3a35c6d; 1a45cc7eefd65f0833ac70a1d6dd349fbcf10e1b; 06db3c8da81adbc3e387db5e530d9c14edc44ed4; cc9f5c136c13ec51028ad11a9fe618fddb842f6e; d556ade3ae067f26f210131d9651cc791afd4b5d; d0b177e2480b5fd51760fb2077b260dacd5891c1; c2835189f9d323844e13facad91be26b0bdb584f; c288ec69264cc43e69067328897d4180385a2148; 7cb38bddb2112b065f83c78d2c724cccf632ea83; 210541a4a37a1bbb5c27a372ba40555d646d0bf8; 6221951f8359eabe580d76a2c9a09d3977f58d6c; 9847e37ebc9da1542bc398e2e664cd333e58a4e6; dc3738be2ff78a2465e8b149c04a2a9aad6edcf7; cc90dd8e4d8299a6d43d798f5cf8eebfab7b1f00; 10dac06d0bdfbb6b68a9e3ebd1272bf2053fec9b; 81bd329b662933cbe9250cc85b2fccb198680e6a; afc4ebddf28fdeea6b81fa32894d2627f5fc9036; 296759fc6a08e3b9cc5bdc57bf23821d820e67b8; bdaa0583b19e60ddab6b60ab63e541be1022ff43; a6e7d91a12324504fcb0646098bfd4296941ca48,,Bioinformatics,22 12,"

1d9420137e23091e64aaad62a9d69a10bee1a52b,The interaction of early life experiences with COMT val158met affects anxiety sensitivity.,"The pathogenesis of anxiety disorders is considered to be multifactorial with a complex interaction of genetic factors and individual environmental factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine gene-by-environment interactions of the genes coding for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) with life events on measures related to anxiety. A sample of healthy subjects (N = 782; thereof 531 women; mean age M = 24.79, SD = 6.02) was genotyped for COMT rs4680 and MAOA-uVNTR (upstream variable number of tandem repeats), and was assessed for childhood adversities [Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)], anxiety sensitivity [Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)] and anxious apprehension [Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)]. Main and interaction effects of genotype, environment and gender on measures related to anxiety were assessed by means of regression analyses. Association analysis showed no main gene effect on either questionnaire score. A significant interactive effect of childhood adversities and COMT genotype was observed: Homozygosity for the low-active met allele and high CTQ scores was associated with a significant increment of explained ASI variance [R(2) = 0.040, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.04]. A borderline interactive effect with respect to MAOA-uVNTR was restricted to the male subgroup. Carriers of the low-active MAOA allele who reported more aversive experiences in childhood exhibited a trend for enhanced anxious apprehension (R(2) = 0.077, FDR corrected P = 0.10). Early aversive life experiences therefore might increase the vulnerability to anxiety disorders in the presence of homozygosity for the COMT 158met allele or low-active MAOA-uVNTR alleles.",2013,Psychology;

e6416abc2f805227b3e6701573243b65ae0c8f03,"Dysbiosis Signatures of Gut Microbiota Along the Sequence from Healthy, Young Patients to Those with Overweight and Obesity.","OBJECTIVE
To investigate the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers (HVs), patients with overweight (OW), and patients with obesity (OB), including those with acanthosis nigricans (AN) or without AN (N-AN).


METHODS
Microbial 16S rRNA genes were examined by using pyrosequencing technology and analyzed by using bioinformatics methods.


RESULTS
Subjects in the OW and OB groups showed severe disturbances in glycemic control, lipid profile, and inflammatory markers (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05); patients with AN had worse metabolic status (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and a lower diversity of microbiota (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The OB and HV groups showed totally different gut microbiota composition. In the OB group, beneficial microbiotas including Bifidobacterium (0.01% vs. 0.05%, false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰=â€‰4.27*10-5 ), anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium (6.70% vs. 13.82%, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.010), and butyrate-producing Ruminococcaceae were significantly decreased, whereas Bacillus (0.58% vs. 0.04%, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.013) and potential opportunistic pathogens such as Fusobacterium (1.44% vs. 0.11%, FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and Escherichia-Shigella (6.01% vs. 0.76%, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.041) had outgrown dramatically. Function prediction revealed a significant increase in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and bacterial invasion of epithelial cell-associated genes and a significant decrease in glucose and essential amino acid-related genes.


CONCLUSIONS
Gut microbiotas and their functions were significantly changed in obesity. More prospective studies on association and causality between microbiota and obesity are imperative and might contribute to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of obesity.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Renyuan Gao"", ids = ""3714634""); list(name = ""Cuiling Zhu"", ids = ""2593865""); list(name = ""Hao Li"", ids = ""47893019""); list(name = ""Mingming Yin"", ids = ""37844456""); list(name = ""Cheng Pan"", ids = ""144317558""); list(name = ""Linsheng Huang"", ids = ""2070741""); list(name = ""Cheng Kong"", ids = ""34923483""); list(name = ""Xingchun Wang"", ids = ""8416781""); list(name = ""Yi Zhang"", ids = ""35636152""); list(name = ""Shen Qu"", ids = ""143905788""); list(name = ""Huanlong Qin"", ids = ""82478164"")",ea865e10a30a1d3da87e8fb6fa009d53b3e8a72b; 83b8afe8a82b758882d71079e619a59a96695be6; 5e5f67cd778ce0b1480b42478ce9463df43cfe97; 86085454a35f75d9c5c30c52ab0e993341110728; a45b047280b0bc1ef7cbf93cc10fc2de5e44a73f; 4b4ba745982552159eae2f3eea44bffacfefe9d8; a6eef34599d748935635d97c1b383fed8543ceec; 150b4f65a6af1eee1483972062603d9c72178d9c; cc73ec8eab040e7f45af02514f7e9e065d2ba411; 77a2cf7d1da194bb61243ba267d94c98716e8758; d197415b2b1e03934df1338b6e62729e64dc630b; 09f4bfaea3cfc7360c132348f792ef4e008087e1; f5860c9ed34878cfa30105e520bee8dd5c7f39d7; 3a6827e46ba8b82f995d80412e84f07a0f25ccd1; 28f4a37a30c7d786c979b8b298fb06ff5858b8a4; 2a42218facac5cc2fb07135a7da1a81e448cd409; a7612b0dcb726a6e9cbf565c4f1557f467ddc3e3; b31c8b5f1af367981db9b86c36ce9e5ac4059370; 060a056c707ceb23aab24a8b70e347d1276bbc08; ddc162bf8cbb9022449b58b6afa48c15b63e45a3; 020aa1e619ff0546151391842ebb1b2454abdc27; 0908adaa11f40bf18fac210ad7f198f5d8eba13f,,Obesity,26 2,"

2c0d3facaf1e362fc89f7ff117fc8a35ccd5eb06,Transcriptional profiling and network analysis of the murine angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"We sought to characterize temporal gene expression changes in the murine angiotensin II (ANG II)-ApoE-/- model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Aortic ultrasound measurements were obtained over the 28-day time-course. Harvested suprarenal aortic segments were evaluated with whole genome expression profiling at 7, 14, and 28 days using the Agilent Whole Mouse Genome microarray platform and Statistical Analysis of Microarrays at a false discovery rate of <1%. A group of angiotensin-treated mice experienced contained rupture (CR) within 7 days and were analyzed separately. Progressive aortic dilatation occurred throughout the treatment period. However, the numerous early expression differences between ANG II-treated and control were not sustained over time. Ontologic analysis revealed widespread upregulation of inflammatory, immune, and matrix remodeling genes with ANG II treatment, among other pathways such as apoptosis, cell cycling, angiogenesis, and p53 signaling. CR aneurysms displayed significant decreases in TGF-Î²/BMP-pathway signaling, MAPK signaling, and ErbB signaling genes vs. non-CR/ANG II-treated samples. We also performed literature-based network analysis, extracting numerous highly interconnected genes associated with aneurysm development such as Spp1, Myd88, Adam17 and Lox. 1) ANG II treatment induces extensive early differential expression changes involving abundant signaling pathways in the suprarenal abdominal aorta, particularly wide-ranging increases in inflammatory genes with aneurysm development. 2) These gene expression changes appear to dissipate with time despite continued growth, suggesting that early changes in gene expression influence disease progression in this AAA model, and that the aortic tissue adapts to prolonged ANG II infusion. 3) Network analysis identified nexus genes that may constitute aneurysm biomarkers or therapeutic targets.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Joshua M.

209f7db3a79d8e811614f5f38833087c98b9b558,Cerebral activation effects of acupuncture at Yanglinquan(GB34) point acquired using resting-state fMRI,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the central mechanism of acupuncture points for regional homogeneity(ReHo) of resting state in brain function after acupuncture at GB34.


METHODS
Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled, which included 4 males and 6 females, aged 20-34 years old with median age of 23. The GE Signa HDxt 3.0â€¯T magnetic resonance imaging were performed before (control group) and after acupuncture at GB34, and differences of different brain ReHo of 2 groups by statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) software and ReHo data processing methods were analyzed. The statistically different brain regions were obtained by false discovery rate corrected (FDR-Corrected).


RESULTS
Compared with control group, the anterior cingulated gyrus, left temporal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, right frontal gyrus were enhanced ReHo after acupuncture at GB34. The left thalamus, right insular cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate were decreased ReHo after acupuncture at GB34.


CONCLUSION
It is demonstrated that the signal synchronization change ReHo in different brain regions including cognitive, motor, default network, limbic system and other parts of encephalic region after acupuncture at GB34, suggesting that the central mechanism of acupuncture at GB34 is the result of all levels of the combined effects of brain networks.",2018,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Liansheng Liu"", ids = ""49479963""); list(name = ""Shuqi Chen"", ids = ""94011232""); list(name = ""Daohui Zeng"", ids = ""8293479""); list(name = ""Hengguo Li"", ids = ""7179152""); list(name = ""Changzheng Shi"", ids = ""49216734""); list(name = ""Lihong Zhang"", ids = ""50081242"")",c13e9b68fea16cd0ae5b201accaf789af0d6cac1; 0dc58c583bc8238bf34064318d24706f799ed9d5,539b259e781a58f3a041ab7dc03ee9108ee37c75; 3ea0e0424a70e524d8d1da36d87fc0d0d7661e21; 00daa981b320d4f6e8bd14b269b585645d5b6abc; 6e86f5e1369afd045daf00e321417b105e1d3eb7; dade9f6d19e95e208240139d6164121fb69c26b3; 3c887c52a3b2b13a1cd4111c9db469f59b8ee127; fea266aa7e9e039a9f419ad06dacc25abe13881a; 69eca85368d1c986d196ee4a13d3a08cbfe28b24; 5e83294c8617cbd4358a898144583979b0111ed4; da99553bc012663e66a1cae8da2a73b2d9bb00e5; 0530387cea855aa90d211cf32ce9de3799923847; 6549be8ca20ea5bfc05d0e246b90236d64e3daf1; 693a6e46be9b613ac5beab7313e1f0b51658dbe9; 1651d9b16f8cfeb3999cf276d348f00907e62181; 5e6f5459c9f0069ff90efae25b32d2862d84d97a; 49539c488945fffa96fcc883e0631ccbdbe936e4; a98ca22278ad85e3ea447a7e6b18c59c8421cd97; 4833aae3cb125477ccda76bb09059ced29ec7de2; ac8877b89b659b388e4c03092c7e9f57c80dc91c; 1c09bd8a29d52b094e32bb8f312fa92381241b26; 678b190a24957df86c06dc3a7f76fe1d021eee80; 85ee63d0dc292c0c8627bf7c41c486ea94f35317; 0570ff70c04664c88a57598ec811264570912e2e; 92aff87c8b1f6715e761af9161516feb7d86f40f,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,67,"

6c6c97e22edec1c39cc2422f58d2e88529f6ae27,Abstract 924: Possible joint effects between single nucleotide polymorphisms in inflammation genes and serum androgen levels on risk of prostate cancer,"Proceedings: AACR 101st Annual Meeting 2010â€â€ Apr 17â€21, 2010; Washington, DC

Both inflammation and androgens are likely to be involved in the etiology of prostate cancer. There is evidence for cross-talk between androgen and inflammation pathways, yet little is known about the joint contribution of inflammation and androgens to prostate cancer risk. Thus, we evaluated the joint effects of 9,932 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 774 inflammation-related genes and four serum androgen measures (total testosterone [T], bioavailable T, 3Î±-androstanediol glucuronide [3Î± diol G], and androstenedione) on risk of prostate cancer in 516 incident cancer cases and 560 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. SNPs included in this study were genotyped as part of the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility genome-wide association study. Likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were used to compare logistic models of prostate cancer regressed on age, center, the androgen (in quartiles), the SNP (additive genetic coding) and the SNP x hormone interaction term to logistic models of prostate cancer regressed on age, center, and the androgen. False discovery rate (FDR) control was used to adjust for multiple testing. Statistically significant LRT P-values were noted for T and three intronic SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.7) within the HIPK2 gene on 7q34 (rs10256326, rs7788362, and rs12539357; FDR-adjusted P=0.04 for all SNPs). For each SNP, the minor allele was associated with a reduced prostate cancer risk in men with serum T levels in the lower three quartiles, but was associated with an increased risk among men in the highest quartile of serum T. LRT P-values of borderline statistical significance were also seen for joint effects of these three SNPs and bioavailable T on risk of prostate cancer (FDR-adjusted P=0.07 for all SNPs). There were no significant joint effects for any of the SNPs with 3Î±diol G or androstenedione after adjustment for multiple tests. Our preliminary results suggest that T levels could interact with HIPK2 gene variants to influence prostate cancer risk. HIPK2 is an attractive candidate gene for further evaluation because it codes for a serine/threonine kinase involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly involved in p53-dependent and independent regulation of cell cycle control and apoptosis. Future studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings and to further understand the possible interaction between T and genetic variants in HIPK2, which could contribute to prostate cancer risk.

7db2ea64fdb626f4edd0b0df510e49b68d0840bb,Novel mechanisms of platinum drug resistance identified in cells selected for resistance to JM118 the active metabolite of satraplatin,"PurposeThe goal of this study was to identify molecular determinants of sensitivity and resistance to JM118, the active metabolite of satraplatin, an orally bioavailable cisplatin analog that has activity in prostate cancer.Experimental designHuman ovarian carcinoma 2008/JM118 cells were derived from parental 2008 cells by repeated exposure to JM118; the revertant 2008/JM118/REV subline was isolated from the 2008/JM118 cells by growth in the absence of drug. Drug sensitivity was determined by clonogenic assay and Pt levels were measured by ICP-MS.ResultsEight sequential rounds of selection yielded the 2008/JM118 subline that was 4.9-fold resistant to JM118 and cross-resistant at varying levels to satraplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. Cross-resistance to the other Pt drugs was lost as resistance to JM118 waned. The same parental 2008 cells selected for resistance to cisplatin were partially cross-resistant to JM118. The 2008/JM118 cells accumulated significantly more Pt than the 2008 cells when exposed to low concentrations of either JM118 or cisplatin indicating a detoxification process that involves intracellular sequestration. In contrast, 2008 cells selected for cisplatin resistance accumulated less cisplatin and less JM118 reflecting a mechanism involving reduced accumulation. The 2008 and 2008/JM118 cells did not differ in their uptake or efflux of 64Cu, expression of Cu efflux transporters ATP7A or ATP7B or their glutathione content. The 2008/JM118 cells exhibited 3.0â€“7.7-fold hypersensitivity to docetaxel, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Expression profiling identified 4 genes that were significantly up-regulated and 19 that were down-regulated in the 2008/JM118 cells at a false discovery rate of 1 gene.ConclusionsWhile the cellular defense mechanisms that protect cells against JM118 also mediate resistance to the other Pt drugs, these mechanisms are quite different from those commonly found in cells selected for resistance to cisplatin. JM118-resistant cells accumulate more rather than less Pt and rely on an intracellular detoxification mechanism different from that involved in cisplatin resistance. This is consistent with clinical evidence suggesting that satraplatin has activity in diseases in which cisplatin does not. In this model, JM118 resistance is associated with substantial collateral hypersensitivity to docetaxel, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Goli Samimi"", ids = ""5205542""); list(name = ""Shuichi Kishimoto"", ids = ""40112046""); list(name = ""Gerald Manorek"", ids = ""6788458""); list(name = ""James K.

Our method treats differential expression as a form of clustering, thus unifying these two concepts. Furthermore, it simultaneously addresses the problem of how many clusters are supported by the data and uncertainty in parameter estimation. DGEclust successfully identifies differentially expressed genes under a number of different scenarios, maintaining a low error rate and an excellent control of its false discovery rate with reasonable computational requirements.

f5142bc4843687b82daa2ce7a5d84e80f37e172d,Genetic association of interleukin-10 promoter polymorphisms and susceptibility to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a meta-analysis.,"Published data on the association between interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene polymorphisms and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed, focusing on four major IL-10 gene variants in the promoter region: -3575T/A, -1082A/G, -819C/T and -592C/A. We applied the false discovery rate (FDR) method to adjust for multiple testing. A significant association between IL-10 -3575T/A polymorphism and the risk of DLBCL was observed in the pooled 10 case-control studies (A vs. T: OR=1.16, 95% CI=1.08-1.25, P<0.0001; AA+TA vs. TT: OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.08-1.33, P=0.0009; AA vs. TA+TT: OR=1.25, 95% CI=1.09-1.44, P=0.001). The results indicated that carriers of -1082G allele (-1082GG/GA genotypes) had a nearly 30% increased risk of DLBCL, as compared with carriers of -1082AA genotype (GG+GA vs. AA: OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.08-1.57, P=0.005). When P-values were not adjusted for multiple testing, the risk was significantly decreased among people with -592AA genotype (AA vs. AC+CC: OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.43-0.94, P=0.02), while carriers with -819TT genotype also modestly weakened the DLBCL susceptibility at a marginal level of significance (TT vs. CT+CC: OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.35-0.99, P=0.05). However, these associations were not significant after correction for multiple testing. This meta-analysis suggests that IL-10 -3575A allele confers a greater risk to DLBCL susceptibility, while -1082A/G polymorphism also has significant association with DLBCL risk. These results may help to further clarify the malignancy-risk gene signature of DLBCL, and thus have prognostic and predictive value especially for early-stage DLBCL.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hai-Yan Cao"", ids = ""2482054""); list(name = ""Ping Zou"", ids = ""144204424""); list(name = ""Hao Zhou"", ids = ""49566236"")",038c73a3917fde65d0cd8bc17011d907dc76e8c6; 7858464c1516edfad62b109e59ff7da3bf792d4a; c5fd08ed9b6bbc0739a70e2f7af6f05776c25c51; f788879ff343aace21abe390a22778242fd7be18; c9075307e205002e07adc5ae9ddbe0d3db5eb25b; 33142226c1756c1c7800257198b2195d0ea2971d; 2729573c0462a1d56b8331f9eb3f0f5366bc6fc8; 66871d6ead14ab2d4eeb5f6e15dd77d87c9586b0; 40c770cb1e4556b3c888323e85212543ba2afc8b; dfca96de630b5c582340f7bde3284666177ea5e8; b131fbf081eaa4793dc04368b66c98da48ff67b6; 031f88a76065172e56518ccc56755685a9e658bc; 85e0f93ed5a93af8e2ec4fe073276bf97622ed3d; 1f188da693a4511b1fbc51a522938b4cff78a8ce,,Gene,519 2,"

En se limitant a l'observation de l'hemisphere nord, le bruit de fond des muons atmospheriques, absorbes par la Terre, est elimine.Par contre, les neutrinos atmospheriques forment un bruit de fond irreductible constituant la majorite des 6100 evenements selectionnes pour cette analyse.Il est cependant possible d'identifier une source ponctuelle de neutrinos cosmiques en recherchant un exces local se detachant du bruit de fond isotrope de neutrinos atmospheriques, couple a une selection basee sur l'energie, dont le spectre est different pour les deux categories de neutrinos.Une approche statistique originale est developpee dans le but d'optimiser le pouvoir de detection de sources ponctuelles, tout en controlant le taux de fausses decouvertes, donc le niveau de confiance d'une observation.Cette methode repose uniquement sur la connaissance de l'hypothese de bruit de fond, sans aucune hypothese sur le modele de production de neutrinos par les sources recherchees.

Its principle rests on the detection of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged secondary particles produced by the interaction of a high energy neutrino (> 100 GeV) with the matter surrounding the detector.This work is based on data recorded by the AMANDA-II detector between 2000 and 2006 in order to search for cosmic sources of neutrinos. A potential signal must be extracted from the overwhelming background of muons and neutrinos originating from the interaction of primary cosmic rays within the atmosphere.The observation is limited to the northern hemisphere in order to be free of the atmospheric muon background, which is stopped by the Earth. However, atmospheric neutrinos constitute an irreducible background composing the main part of the 6100 events selected for this analysis.It is nevertheless possible to identify a point source of cosmic neutrinos by looking for a local excess breaking away from the isotropic background of atmospheric neutrinos;This search is coupled with a selection based on the energy, whose spectrum is different from that of the atmospheric neutrino background.An original statistical approach has been developed in order to optimize the detection of point sources, whilst controlling the false discovery rate -- hence the confidence level -- of an observation. This method is based solely on the knowledge of the background hypothesis, without any assumption on the production model of neutrinos in sought sources. Moreover, the method naturally accounts for the trial factor inherent in multiple testing.The procedure was applied on the final sample of events collected by AMANDA-II.",2010,Physics,"list(name = ""Mathieu Labare"", ids = ""3425387""); list(name = ""Daniel Bertrand"", ids = ""71033947"")",,,,,
22ae3feb652adb6197c17d31139bb67d475d1870,Calling genotypes from public RNA-sequencing data enables identification of genetic variants that affect gene-expression levels,"BackgroundRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique for the identification of genetic variants that affect gene-expression levels, either through expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping or through allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis. Given increasing numbers of RNA-seq samples in the public domain, we here studied to what extent eQTLs and ASE effects can be identified when using public RNA-seq data while deriving the genotypes from the RNA-sequencing reads themselves.MethodsWe downloaded the raw reads for all available human RNA-seq datasets. Using these reads we performed gene expression quantification. All samples were jointly normalized and subjected to a strict quality control. We also derived genotypes using the RNA-seq reads and used imputation to infer non-coding variants. This allowed us to perform eQTL mapping and ASE analyses jointly on all samples that passed quality control. Our results were validated using samples for which DNA-seq genotypes were available.Results4,978 public human RNA-seq runs, representing many different tissues and cell-types, passed quality control. Even though these data originated from many different laboratories, samples reflecting the same cell type clustered together, suggesting that technical biases due to different sequencing protocols are limited. In a joint analysis on the 1,262 samples with high quality genotypes, we identified cis-eQTLs effects for 8,034 unique genes (at a false discovery rate â‰¤0.05). eQTL mapping on individual tissues revealed that a limited number of samples already suffice to identify tissue-specific eQTLs for known disease-associated genetic variants. Additionally, we observed strong ASE effects for 34 rare pathogenic variants, corroborating previously observed effects on the corresponding protein levels.ConclusionsBy deriving and imputing genotypes from RNA-seq data, it is possible to identify both eQTLs and ASE effects. Given the exponential growth of the number of publicly available RNA-seq samples, we expect this approach will become especially relevant for studying the effects of tissue-specific and rare pathogenic genetic variants to aid clinical interpretation of exome and genome sequencing.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Patrick Deelen"", ids = ""2893158""); list(name = ""Daria V Zhernakova"", ids = ""6462050""); list(name = ""Mark de Haan"", ids = ""114196773""); list(name = ""Marijke R. van der Sijde"", ids = ""116660231""); list(name = ""Marc Jan Bonder"", ids = ""1695606""); list(name = ""Juha M.

6980e993d8ee7d17f84566014abd3aeece527cdb,Identification of human liver microsomal proteins adducted by a reactive metabolite using shotgun proteomics.,"Covalent modification of cellular proteins by chemically reactive compounds/metabolites has the potential to disrupt biological function and elicit serious adverse drug reactions. Information on the nature and binding patterns of protein targets are critical toward understanding the mechanism of drug induced toxicity. Protein covalent binding studies established in liver microsomes can quantitively estimate the extent of protein modification, but they provide little information on the nature of the modified proteins. In this article, we describe a label-free shotgun proteomic workflow for the identification of target proteins modified in situ by reactive metabolites in human liver microsome incubations. First, we developed a shotgun proteomic workflow for the characterization of the human liver microsomal subproteome, which consists of predominately membrane-bound proteins. Human liver microsomes were solubilized with a combination of MS-compatible organic solvents followed by protein reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion. The unmodified samples were analyzed by UHPLC-MS/MS, and the proteins were identified by database searching. This workflow led to the successful identification of 329 human liver microsomal subproteome proteins with 1% FDR (false discovery rate). The same method was then applied to identify the modifications of human liver microsomal proteins by a known reactive metabolite 2-(methylsulfonyl)benzo[d]thiazole (2), either after incubation directly with 2 or with its parent compound 2-(methylthio)benzo[d]thiazole (1). A total of 19 modified constituent peptides which could be mapped to 18 proteins were identified in human liver microsomes incubated directly with 2. Among these, 5 modified constituent peptides which could be mapped to 4 proteins were identified in incubation with 1, which is known to generate 2 in human liver microsomal incubations. This label-free workflow is generally applicable to the identification and characterization of proteins adducted with reactive metabolites in complex matrices and may serve as a valuable tool to understand the link between protein targets and clinically relevant toxicities.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yan-ou Yang"", ids = ""49308153""); list(name = ""Qing Xiao"", ids = ""153446783""); list(name = ""W Griffith Humphreys"", ids = ""3814080""); list(name = ""Ashok Dongre"", ids = ""49608429""); list(name = ""Yue-Zhong Shu"", ids = ""87242487"")",1c8e1e97656480b6ba1f62a3c8aa7e6e2b891cd1; 87e4f3f56abf7694d88be6de73ff66ccdb791339,fc54252d91b9f2c3dc1a0a48c26b50b11e92b8f1; 6ffce72413899312ff802055fd48a9c0dfc4d4e4; b0fccbfe47b0c91b39a3a7b42dfdfb1ebeb14ba7; dcbf33cfa307d5910b1982e15e41ee2a11e7a425; 363d04283f8517593794e3f5183e981512358cd0; 5c4ad9673a4853cce2f8d2a1d868f2a628561c20; b90b2b513bdc4963c40634fafe6af86c144a8186; 3b80b242b6a1c826a7f99f5fa1958beec68c6438; 02d1a302f2b6f579d198930c2e33e8931a7e0dec; 39725e1814ff38b5afbc24b306bef66346d9b080; 030804bffd66a50a127890ccdb5f21c97782f2b8; 9b3fad4db86271e4b57d909c65a9e2ba87840893; bb3095aaf3c8ab73efd3891662260fa158a91ea4; 3e66e813978a783775194b7beaea28eb61ad97f1; 48793da33eb98e14f8da2d35486eb68f31e14b6e; 25de3c131c862b04211c1fca3efc666b13967056; d08f2d45252334a27e78bda155bac5e4e13a565f; e21ebc58bec522f6d97b30343f577d02a3dbf646; 46802d9d2cd7ab5a09e53570c4129bf34f326d5c; 7e7088254b9d4047c787a52b36d1597ed77b42d0; 027b28e3645a725827893f305d9fbfd3bb4f6e37; 14535cc94a8dcb54eb3d71dc532d9b1e5d4181fc; 899a4c30913693f3a658da65f2a869ac9d86e56d; f24b8af633c2c65120bbf2c91a39bab4e9d45ba5; da73f4303f9d785cf2d0a61989826c10e4a68fcd; 617b543f566e1ce6e8304af1cdd35f5216addbba; 82802d56e5eeaa695f26932165d0789774ab12f7; 85675f464599530e0cf6612991f6bb498e4e8574; 0c5a631501ccde65bfcf0798149111784ef13342; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; bfd0f715befe6fa6e4a73c4865dfd284e2c8d171; 90ba8fa7e29fd1d5a9720f40af18e8854d75f5bd; 0a65bd7ee9a598a7e5d7351fee130c2037fcff39; aad60fc5118a665746e43e5b1779d6a0a88a61ab; 5daab3821cd712eb25a04df4a7e709b1e15bdd7d; 90c0c0b82094c0f947d2476cb318ebed4373f3c4; 23b206d92a8589deed54a68c0f248adaf2966bc2; 5145b49dd933aaca77a809c5b591d0a8b1c24983; 7c6d5655db3d71ebd03c9b0956318771b79f35a6; c4969a17688e05326b2c78e89edb8af6f696eef8,Chemical research in toxicology,27 9,"

Yeast two-hybrid screens are an important method to map pairwise protein interactions. This method can generate spurious interactions (false discoveries), and true interactions can be missed (false negatives). Previously, we reported a capture-recapture estimator for bait-specific precision and recall. Here, we present an improved method that better accounts for heterogeneity in bait-specific error rates.


RESULT
For yeast, worm and fly screens, we estimate the overall false discovery rates (FDRs) to be 9.9%, 13.2% and 17.0% and the false negative rates (FNRs) to be 51%, 42% and 28%. Bait-specific FDRs and the estimated protein degrees are then used to identify protein categories that yield more (or fewer) false positive interactions and more (or fewer) interaction partners. While membrane proteins have been suggested to have elevated FDRs, the current analysis suggests that intrinsic membrane proteins may actually have reduced FDRs. Hydrophobicity is positively correlated with decreased error rates and fewer interaction partners. These methods will be useful for future two-hybrid screens, which could use ultra-high-throughput sequencing for deeper sampling of interacting bait-prey pairs.

f54ad3878c6cd7a1a9ccd1bc6ac3388da61b62e3,Abstract 3741: Identification of RNA binding proteins influenced by ionizing radiation through RNA interactome capture,"Cells respond to ionizing radiation (IR) through the activities of constitutively expressed proteins and through changes in gene expression. Constitutively expressed proteins play well-defined roles in major components of the cellular radioresponse, such as DNA repair and cell cycle. However, the contribution of changes in gene expression to the radioresponse is less understood. We have previously demonstrated through polysome profiling and microarray analysis that translational control is a key component of radiation-induced changes in gene expression. In response to IR, specific transcripts are recruited to or away from polysomes without affecting the global polysome profile of the cells. One mechanistic explanation for this observation is that IR influences the activity of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate the inclusion or exclusion of transcripts from polysomes. Here, we utilized RNA interactome capture (RIC) to identify RBPs bound to transcripts in control and irradiated human cancer cells. Cells were either mock irradiated or treated with 2Gy. One hour post-IR, RNA and protein complexes were crosslinked with 254 nm UV light. mRNA was isolated from cell lysates with oligo(dT) magnetic beads followed by several rounds of highly stringent washes to remove non-specific interactors. RNA was removed from crosslinked proteins by RNase digestion. The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and the subsequent peptides were analyzed by label-free quantification mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. Proteome Discoverer 2.2 was used to search the data against human proteins from the UniProt database using SequestHT with a 1% false discovery rate. We found that we were able to efficiently pull down RNA:protein complexes with a crosslinking dose of 150 mJ/cm 2 . As determined by silver staining, the protein pattern of crosslinked samples differed greatly from protein isolated from whole cell lysates. By western blot, this method highly enriched for known RBPs, such as PTBP1 and CUGBP1, while contamination from non-RBPs, such as actin and tubulin, was not detected. By mass spectrometry, we identified hundreds of RBPs in each replicate above the no crosslinking background control for both untreated and irradiated cells. However, more RBPs were consistently detected in the control cells. Examples of RBPs preferentially binding in control cells include SSB, a protein involved in a variety of RNA metabolic processes, and U2AF2, a protein involved in RNA splicing. Overall, these data demonstrate that RIC is a sensitive and rigorous method to identify RBPs and that RBPs may play a role in radiation-induced post-transcriptional gene regulation. Preferential binders identified by this method may provide further insight into pathways regulating tumor cell radiosensitivity. Citation Format: Stacey L. Lehman, Theresa Wechsler, Gaelyn C.

c53a146208e4502587c8fd3c8519a63387b0eab8,"Detecting gene signature activation in breast cancer in an absolute, single-patient manner","BackgroundThe ability to reliably identify the state (activated, repressed, or latent) of any molecular process in the tumor of a patient from an individual whole-genome gene expression profile obtained from microarray or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) promises important clinical utility. Unfortunately, all previous bioinformatics tools are only applicable in large and diverse panels of patients, or are limited to a single specific pathway/process (e.g. proliferation).MethodsUsing a panel of 4510 whole-genome gene expression profiles from 10 different studies we built and selected models predicting the activation status of a compendium of 1733 different biological processes. Using a second independent validation dataset of 742 patients we validated the final list of 1773 models to be included in a de novo tool entitled absolute inference of patient signatures (AIPS). We also evaluated the prognostic significance of the 1773 individual models to predict outcome in all and in specific breast cancer subtypes.ResultsWe described the development of the de novo tool entitled AIPS that can identify the activation status of a panel of 1733 different biological processes from an individual breast cancer microarray or RNA-seq profile without recourse to a broad cohort of patients. We demonstrated that AIPS is stable compared to previous tools, as the inferred pathway state is not affected by the composition of a dataset. We also showed that pathway states inferred by AIPS are in agreement with previous tools but use far fewer genes. We determined that several AIPS-defined pathways are prognostic across and within molecularly and clinically define subtypes (two-sided log-rank test false discovery rate (FDR) <5%). Interestingly, 74.5% (1291/1733) of the models are able to distinguish patients with luminal A cancer from those with luminal B cancer (Fisherâ€™s exact test FDR <5%).ConclusionAIPS represents the first tool that would allow an individual breast cancer patient to obtain a thorough knowledge of the molecular processes active in their tumor from only one individual gene expression (N-of-1) profile.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric R.

99abf365f68535d009434ef1cd64fc7ccbf2b461,Inflammation and oxidative stress are lower in physically fit and active adults.,"The objective of this study was to determine if the inverse relationship between perceived physical fitness (pFIT) and exercise frequency (ExFreq) levels and chronic inflammation and oxidative stress exists after making statistical adjustments for confounders including body mass index (BMI), age, gender, and cigarette smoking. Study participants (60% female and 40% male; n = 998) varied widely in age (18-85 years) and BMI (16.7-52.7 kg/m(2)) completed an extensive medical/health and lifestyle questionnaire, and data were used to establish pFIT and ExFreq tertiles. Biomarkers included serum C-reactive protein (CRP), total blood leukocytes, five plasma cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)], F2 -isoprostanes, ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). A general linear model was used to examine relationships between pFIT and ExFreq with inflammation and oxidative stress while controlling for age, gender, BMI, and smoking. Benjamini-Hochberg method for false discovery rate correction was used for multiple testing corrections. Significant tests (P < 0.05) for trend were found for the effect of pFIT and ExFreq on CRP, white blood cell, IL-6, TNF-Î±, GCSF, and F2 -isoprostanes, but not MCP1, IL-10, FRAP, and ORAC, after adjustment for confounders. These data indicate that an inverse relationship exists among chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and pFIT and ExFreq at the community level even after adjustment for important confounders.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""R.

The detection of the change points, namely the positions where the mean changes, is an important problem in such fields as engineering, economics, climatology and bioscience. This problem has attracted a lot of attention in statistics, and a variety of solutions have been proposed and implemented. However, there is scant literature on the theoretical properties of those algorithms. Here, we investigate a recently developed algorithm called the Screening and Ranking Algorithm (SaRa). We characterize the theoretical properties of SaRa and show its superiority over other commonly used algorithms. In particular, we develop a false discovery rate approach to the multiple change-point problem and show a strong sure coverage property for the SaRa.",2013,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ning Hao"", ids = ""48205408""); list(name = ""Yue Selena Niu"", ids = ""48393875""); list(name = ""Heping Zhang"", ids = ""2532807"")",983d65c0e555cd183343ed5ad4b4d288cd926e7d; 49e944b32090eb992d00257769f489a880449ef7; 4710637d62db175913dbd33b4d753e99a1f44f92; 7870987268667188b81f064fb480bdb32bcda24a; b4b5f30f2852b6b7bc8963fa4f7c9b697642331c; 06774b081bbb7726def172ea5a04b1b552d97062; dd77fe3ef41925ecd271487d14aed804b3c31155; 9f46278ad49daac94965e4c4825633870e11e0fc; 9bf87d46d1d2398eddf2ccd89e826d3f7efd27b7; 88dd551787344978ab57e15e706dd3fbd64389b4; 01e8aa52e4277dd20a97c2c9a87bea98ba797bc0; 71246e046b271950d65091df585a8127ad1c60b7; 86b2be90568549b2f3a3983f61604040376000b9; 415b8633932aad43ef3fe892a986ce1eb160335b; b330d86d62f1b6c4a401e00903e855fcb4b2548d; 462e24910b71ac2895f18dc46d94237dc20fece0; cc7fb1c385f046af6cc9c77d1ea1f9fe0c31c92c,24aa349b02c7096bc94a86da77d67bc33dd2ff47; 7fcb709fc08fabd353aae72974ae51bc650b923b; 874cc3d7f38afed3543f961b49511aead2c91457; 1720998874dbcebfbe72856945633c097e69387f; c68ece3ff36a4b3b9c747768b4bd375051f66df9; 23253676fa190baaf5979fae3ff5472763431d46; 7862d93331c6d59bb5d55e481fc0dae9c6741afa; 71421b7b6ebccebb74420b1c940134c7ff3cdb43; cbac34649082191f0b0eb74f647fc17118e5c47c; 9d3a22b070de6352d428b4b820502ce1fff3ce3a; d45206169004af1f3878bd88d9c079b283f8ab92; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; dda2441b5274ab2787d74e852fcffa0f0e4da446; 7f0d11f139066d3fd782e076348f620f6ecd128d; 118e6fbd30ec28e320fdd1d9339aa0760b0fc7da; 9c62d39c17322a85d7fb1f2063e3143b8f9f00e1; 8e3b4be2e4942230ec0a510547f9db78bbd5b8d7; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4e1d4bc2eb7ea2792fb28719e449e53ac7a4709f; 50e98fd0e7e5290c2418adfc4bd4e0c100e4e836; 544713f6b33af67edc6fd18e8087e6dceb34708c; 3fa8d8fe73f60869a76f46d96460adff98fe52c6; 954527c6a96c5d11c42e42c58d8d25fd13a137e5; b0037dcd8ac531d4934e8aec038cef27f9b5cace; f6dc99771f5eafbb62f108a8a2b6dc91d3745661; c42fa945aa1985d34c57fcf46db3b5cc6d1fe96c,Statistica Sinica,23 4,"

850e3676a1288939ad299d69a5f02ac8d596cb91,The Holdout Randomization Test: Principled and Easy Black Box Feature Selection,"We consider the problem of feature selection using black box predictive models. For example, high-throughput devices in science are routinely used to gather thousands of features for each sample in an experiment. The scientist must then sift through the many candidate features to find explanatory signals in the data, such as which genes are associated with sensitivity to a prospective therapy. Often, predictive models are used for this task: the model is fit, error on held out data is measured, and strong performing models are assumed to have discovered some fundamental properties of the system. A model-specific heuristic is then used to inspect the model parameters and rank important features, with top features reported as ""discoveries."" However, such heuristics provide no statistical guarantees and can produce unreliable results. We propose the holdout randomization test (HRT) as a principled approach to feature selection using black box predictive models. The HRT is similar to a permutation test, where each random reshuffling is a draw from the complete conditional distribution of the feature being tested. The HRT is model agnostic and produces a valid $p$-value for each feature, enabling control over the false discovery rate (or Type I error) for any predictive model. Further, the HRT is computationally efficient and, in simulations, has greater power than a competing knockoffs-based approach.

1c20be6817e06988735c30cb9eecaf05e0c21c9a,Using Domain Knowledge to Overcome Latent Variables in Causal Inference from Time Series,"Increasingly large observational datasets from healthcare and social media may allow new types of causal inference. However, these data are often missing key variables, increasing the chance of finding spurious causal relationships due to confounding. While methods exist for causal inference with latent variables in static cases, temporal relationships are more challenging, as varying time lags make latent causes more difficult to uncover and approaches often have significantly higher computational complexity. To address this, we make the key observation that while a variable may be latent in one dataset, it may be observed in another, or we may have domain knowledge about its effects. We propose a computationally efficient method that overcomes latent variables by using prior knowledge to reconstruct data for unobserved variables, while remaining robust to cases when the knowledge is wrong or does not apply. On simulated data, our approach outperforms the state of the art with a lower false discovery rate for causal inference. On real-world data from individuals with Type 1 diabetes, we show that our approach can discover causal relationships involving unmeasured meals and exercise.",2019,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Min Zheng"", ids = ""152375022""); list(name = ""Samantha Kleinberg"", ids = ""50779209"")",,4a5f3d8220007f68d13d3b2226a84f192c9ffea9; 5b3b9fe128e6849d59a26d7ceda57baad2524815; d635f28fab09eaafbd0460699264a13eeb76a55f; a49edddb92b5c2326d9f1733d3e7b7998ba9b4b4; 4d33ca36dcc388142ec3c6b9b2abf88faf21706c; 6e8698c11d46931345b1b9cc7547c41e96c4bc7a; 296de0337ba49be1336a2ccea97e4738077aa753; 1c3b85a83a9e5b88bf638f3567cc279156c64fe2; 83a713611cfbf92c3433dd1b0b4d6b3508c75ee6; 954d2ddc70743c10a2f7d47109f739d323fd55bb; 69b43ef3adef43f7a36972d7b3f10dc851d7fdae; baf9d5d633b0cad461561f5033ddf57d253ffcb8; ccfcd4c205b9f2b7aba6fd425e8f7132fd47e9d2; 1beba69cdaedd78a8a02b080bdd4f0183590c98e; af4c6643fa5b41f009efc173801f24c1fdc2cac0; c938831243b5135f63ba3afab2092ab859fe1990; 93a70da0a1404c0ce645287b92275308521836c8; b6bf6aa531f0a0edc848bd8e0b9791a5ae673544; 62064218665ad89f0cb2a44f5b19f7703d9c7e71; 22f9c4b85f2593e9869870de085ccd19493f95f0; 94f1039d7f27f552f4d861e88bd5f575dea4d5dc; ef7b8d129173a0f60f485d3328243a5f17902771; 30afaa049032a6a4880867c7bca7894684b40ebd; 8ca4d166301dea196277daa6e07323147c3589e6; ca31b3af716e838502ab93efe877837c22b780cc; d575979d0dae2ea4851baba77a654fb6e49055eb; 41eef35bb24f16f182cf9c25f044d1404e78df87; 1b3c3c7064d2c628e78095e77685d216caa90d86,Proceedings of machine learning research,106,"

55fc1f532d0a19ecc55db8bcbdf11406b6385fc1,"Epigenetics biomarkers of delirium: immune response, inflammatory response and cholinergic synaptic involvement evidenced by genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of delirious inpatients","Background The authors previously hypothesized the role of epigenetics in pathophysiology of delirium, and tested DNA methylation (DNAm) change among pro-inflammatory cytokines along with aging in blood, glia and neuron. The authors reported that DNAm level of the TNF-alpha decreases along with aging in blood and glia, but not in neuron; however, DNAm differences between delirium cases and non-delirium controls have not been investigated directly. Therefore, in the present study, DNAm differences in blood between delirium patients and controls without delirium were examined. Methods A case-control study with 92 subjects was conducted. Whole blood samples were collected and genome-wide DNAm was measured by the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays. The correlation between DNAm levels in the TNF-alpha and age, network analysis, and the correlation between age and DNAm age were tested. Results Only delirium cases showed 3 CpGs sites in the TNF-alpha significantly correlated to age after multiple corrections. A genome-wide significant CpG site near the gene of LDLRAD4 was identified. In addition, network analysis showed several significant pathways with false discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05. The top pathway with GO was immune response, and the second top pathway with KEGG was cholinergic synapse. Although there was no statistically significant difference, DNAm age among non-delirium controls showed â€œslower agingâ€ compared to delirium cases. Conclusions DNAm differences were shown both at gene and network levels between delirium cases and non-delirium controls. This finding indicates that DNAm status in blood has a potential to be used as epigenetic biomarkers for delirium.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Taku Saito"", ids = ""145183389""); list(name = ""Hiroyuki Toda"", ids = ""49968571""); list(name = ""Gabrielle N.

03c7df08b2d3efcd9ac0099831019ba2c313cec0,Biologic similarities based on age at onset in oligoarticular and polyarticular subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.,"OBJECTIVE
To explore biologic correlates to age at onset in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression analysis.


METHODS
PBMCs were isolated from 56 healthy controls and 104 patients with recent-onset JIA (39 with persistent oligoarticular JIA, 45 with rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA, and 20 with systemic JIA). RNA was amplified and labeled using NuGEN Ovation, and gene expression was assessed with Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips.


RESULTS
A total of 832 probe sets revealed gene expression differences (false discovery rate 5%) in PBMCs from children with oligoarticular JIA whose disease began before age 6 years (early-onset disease) compared with those whose disease began at or after age 6 years (late-onset disease). In patients with early-onset disease, there was greater expression of genes related to B cells and less expression of genes related to cells of the myeloid lineage. Support vector machine analyses identified samples from patients with early- or late-onset oligoarticular JIA (with 97% accuracy) or from patients with early- or late-onset polyarticular JIA (with 89% accuracy), but not from patients with systemic JIA or healthy controls. Principal components analysis showed that age at onset was the major classifier of samples from patients with oligoarticular JIA and patients with polyarticular JIA.


CONCLUSION
PBMC gene expression analysis reveals biologic differences between patients with early-and late-onset JIA, independent of classification based on the number of joints involved. These data suggest that age at onset may be an important parameter to consider in JIA classification. Furthermore, pathologic mechanisms may vary with age at onset, and understanding these processes may lead to improved treatment of JIA.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael G.

9309e4ae1afd5b7337fc62e290f082c2bbfde624,Population-specific gene expression in the plant pathogenic nematode Heterodera glycines exists prior to infection and during the onset of a resistant or susceptible reaction in the roots of the Glycine max genotype Peking,"BackgroundA single Glycine max (soybean) genotype (Peking) reacts differently to two different populations of Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode) within the first twelve hours of infection during resistant (R) and susceptible (S) reactions. This suggested that H. glycines has population-specific gene expression signatures. A microarray analysis of 7539 probe sets representing 7431 transcripts on the AffymetrixÂ® soybean GeneChipÂ® were used to identify population-specific gene expression signatures in pre-infective second stage larva (pi-L2) prior to their infection of Peking. Other analyses focused on the i nfective L2 at 12h ours post infection (i-L212h), and the i nfective sedentary stages at 3d ays post infection (i-L23d) and 8d ays post infection (i-L2/L38d).ResultsDifferential expression and false discovery rate (FDR) analyses comparing populations of pi-L2 (i.e., incompatible population, NL1-RHg to compatible population, TN8) identified 71 genes that were induced in NL1-RHg as compared to TN8. These genes included putative gland protein G23G12, putative esophageal gland protein Hgg-20 and arginine kinase. The comparative analysis of pi-L2 identified 44 genes that were suppressed in NL1-RHg as compared to TN8. These genes included a different Hgg-20 gene, an EXPB1 protein and a cuticular collagen. By 12 h, there were 7 induced genes and 0 suppressed genes in NL1-RHg. By 3d, there were 9 induced and 10 suppressed genes in NL1-RHg. Substantial changes in gene expression became evident subsequently. At 8d there were 13 induced genes in NL1-RHg. This included putative gland protein G20E03, ubiquitin extension protein, putative gland protein G30C02 and Î²-1,4 endoglucanase. However, 1668 genes were found to be suppressed in NL1-RHg. These genes included steroid alpha reductase, serine proteinase and a collagen protein.ConclusionThese analyses identify a genetic expression signature for these two populations both prior to and subsequently as they undergo an R or S reaction. The identification of genes like steroid alpha reductase and serine proteinase that are involved in feeding and nutritional uptake as being highly suppressed during the R response at 8d may indicate genes that the plant is targeting. The analyses also identified numerous putative parasitism genes that are differentially expressed. The 1668 genes that are suppressed in NL1-RHg, and hence induced in TN8 may represent genes that are important during the parasitic stages of H. glycines development. The potential for different arrays of putative parasitism genes to be expressed in different nematode populations may indicate how H. glycines evolve mechanisms to overcome resistance.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vincent P.

4a5fdcbdb7e0b0755caf0ea7032970eef1b90569,Genetic variations in angiogenesis pathway genes associated with clinical outcome in localized gastric adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND
Angiogenesis has been attributed to be a well-recognized aspect of human cancer biology. As such, proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-1, endostatin (ES) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediate the regulation of early-onset angiogenesis and in turn impact the process of tumor-growth and disease progression.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained from 137 patients with localized gastric cancer at University of Southern California and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center medical facilities. DNA was extracted and genotyping was carried out using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based protocols.


RESULTS
In false discovery rate-adjusted univariate analysis, PAR-1 -506 ins/del (P < 0.001), ES +4349 G>A (P = 0.004), and IL-8 -251 T>A (P < 0.0001) were associated with time to tumor recurrence (TTR). Further, PAR-1 -506 ins/del and IL-8 -251 were associated with overall survival (OS). After adjusting for covariates, IL-8 remained significantly associated with TTR (adjusted P = 0.003) and OS (adjusted P = 0.049), whereas ES was significantly associated with TTR (adjusted P = 0.026).


CONCLUSIONS
Polymorphisms in PAR-1, ES, and IL-8 may serve as independent molecular prognostic markers in patients with localized gastric adenocarcinoma. The assessment of the patients' individual risk on the basis of interindividual genotypes may therefore help to identify patient subgroups at high risk for poor clinical outcome.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Georg Lurje"", ids = ""5154150""); list(name = ""Hatim Husain"", ids = ""145407107""); list(name = ""Derek Power"", ids = ""46383658""); list(name = ""Dongyun Yang"", ids = ""1912092""); list(name = ""Susan Groshen"", ids = ""2617370""); list(name = ""Alexander Pohl"", ids = ""50700202""); list(name = ""Wen Zhang"", ids = ""2151884""); list(name = ""Yan Ning"", ids = ""2582747""); list(name = ""Philipp C.

b8671afc7f44208ce9e4269b30f9bea7fdcae344,Investigating gene expression profiles of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using multiple collection and processing methods,"Gene expression profiling using blood samples is a valuable tool for biomarker discovery in clinical studies. Different whole blood RNA collection and processing methods are highly variable and might confound comparisons of results across studies. The main aim of the current study is to compare how blood storage, extraction methodologies, and the blood components themselves may influence gene expression profiling. Whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected in triplicate from five healthy donors. Whole blood was collected in RNAgardÂ® and PAXgeneÂ® Blood RNA Tubes, as well as in collection tubes with anticoagulants such as dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) and Acid Citrate Dextrose Solution A (ACD-A). PBMCs were separated using sodium citrate Cell Preparation Tubes (CPTâ„¢), FICOLLâ„¢, magnetic separation, and the LeukoLOCKâ„¢ methods. After blood collection, the LeukoLOCKâ„¢, K2EDTA and ACD-A blood tubes were shipped overnight using cold conditions and samples from the rest of the collection were immediately frozen with or without pre-processing. The RNA was isolated from whole blood and PBMCs using a total of 10 different experimental conditions employing several widely utilized RNA isolation methods. The RNA quality was assessed by RNA Integrity Number (RIN), which showed that all PBMC procedures had the highest RIN values when blood was stabilized in TRIzolÂ® Reagent before RNA extraction. Initial data analysis showed that human blood stored and shipped at 4Â°C overnight performed equally well when checked for quality using RNA integrity number when compared to frozen stabilized blood. Comparisons within and across donor/method replicates showed signal-to-noise patterns which were not captured by RIN value alone. Pathway analysis using the top 1000 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed frozen vs. cold shipping conditions greatly impacted gene expression patterns in whole blood. However, the top 1000 FDR corrected DEGs from PBMCs preserved after frozen vs. cold shipping conditions (LeukoLOCKâ„¢ preserved in RNAlaterÂ®) revealed no significantly affected pathways. Our results provide novel insight into how RNA isolation, various storage, handling, and processing methodologies can influence RNA quality and apparent gene expression using blood samples.

23a29dce274309088d79bb50887b1c8f0a13b221,Classification of high-dimensional data based on multiple testing methods,"Supervised and unsupervised classification are common topics in machine learning in both scientific and industrial fields, which usually involve three tasks: prediction, exploration, and explanation. False discovery rate (FDR) theory has a close connection to classical classification theory, which must be employed in a sophisticated way to achieve good performance in various contexts. The study aims to explore novel supervised classifiers and unsupervised classification approaches for functional data and high-dimensional data in genome study by using FDR, respectively. One work develops a novel classifier for functional data by casting the classification problem into a multiple testing task, which involves using statistical depth functions. The other two works essentially deal with p-values or tail-areas by using FDR in the large scale testing problem. One work proposes a novel algorithm to yield reproducible differential expression analysis for microarray and RNA-Seq data. The proposed algorithm combines the cross-validation type subsampling and false discovery rate, where the p-values obtained from the training data are used to fit a mixture of baseline and signal distributions by using the EM algorithm, which is in turn used to screen the significance for the p-values obtained from the testing data. Another work proposes a novel weighted p-value approach to explore the association between microRNAs and COPD emphysema severity by regulating the mRNA expressions, while integrating patient phenotype information. This proposed method can be applied to study the causality between miRNA and any particular disease, by exploring the precise role of miRNA in regulating genes.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chong Ma"", ids = ""48168084"")",,955331997f80c58ab6557dcd72a2e20598f9ed8a; 86dd743c8408f216a3b40f47a9236872cd433423; 138378a6833206f388501e32cbbac59afda9cfdf; 8a6cb2536e09cc6683a4c91cf133e3078bd9bdea; 1030ebdfcad3e29d0f47a30e3897779653bbce57; c13eacfa7035fbd3b9889c20332b4181c28545eb; a77963007550ad7cc12413e3af5590882b598687; 95b1ddb21d6a0b66176ac3a9489e6e352d4eb697; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 6d03a38c5ddb7c7cd1ceb59b28907dc918c5d83a; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; 2c0cdd08a8d3cb834da33515037eafa4bdb5faff; e52b5861aec2f62c599de9bf51761cd55b63b490; 5a472e226c9c544af973eaa8056924b345397ae7; 64c89bc1aec45637e43fc98434b78ed161ad1ca1; 3c02c434d09701bbdaf6b173a2ac9c8e4a93f8d3; 54afee448014d3ba3cc5dad1fb6dc73fc2f98b17; 5413f5c428e155119b9b8f2ff7a27292bb51e087; 69e88af9a98996a9b291d18b8bb67656d3a9b8e6; dab8c701d1f1c9134a5994515c07c919e8eb9db6; d78837afeedbb3c9dfa91a675aa03d34ef5a4387; ae67b341dbffd04d883b831bf77179cf710bbeec; 6bb452c4e5b1c47010c379d99881f018b9088e88; 97c4ead52f67e84d6ab55bb4f73a192533a95e1a; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 954bd0fc66cab96e4a4f605b9952e128d3912cc8; e35a7f19fb358740f9fec0d52e666cb8a376244c; 6fd18868a67c8b48b1358e36607d6df531a2fc09; 8c955ea6d8b19bee9b5360c956a7a5ed947114fe; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 009acdc4da6a67185cab82dcad4fdbc3e9becbf9; ad04762f2c78335ab0e424a28abaed687460a916; 5e6b361d00c08b638437030124412268a6f74028; f500af67584c5a312180d74989f914566a7aac62; 3430c978d3484cc18a115205dc4382920f3defb9; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 95f37ed06b5d523f60e35f0c1f065267648c35ef; 40fbacf4e9396815fa0eaf6c245fa6c7f3af60b2; 481640d19622a24e3a37067ab6d3010a2805de20; 0ead2b74b2be40c1447c3ddcde5f8ac94c27e0cc; fd486a7877630d7c6192acb46407294f13975c9d; 977e6e75479e5d92ea0214e4a6002a96f7263a7c; 4225126bdc2a75577fa6f9ea67d0b4617773c44b; 91b3ef8e5827c66d841a773d4d1190b6007f4735; 0a7c6b5bf035199b2054d8822b6e36534022b664; 688feee86cfd878473bd68593bb785e31d25008d; 32babc3cc6a29d844cdaa78974659fda76c4e035; ab91e7e839042ff2a696074e2ec00cd1b17a7ccd; 64ad2a945dd2ee16abe9e6750002ec526f09f868; 12bfb2927ea89e3e119b60389a2d4fff8ddddaa7; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 11074490791dfcde8d3666c825239b045542de44; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 7e2534c5f13d87a22b277458666aef109c245a0e; ce2605f83e604a55beafdc4bc003c5979c8d794a; 8602d2caf2bb9d7b36a29dbfdc564a5afbc6e56a; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; ed67af3973dfc2394ea7fdb5a806e9b242840fc5; fb3231b4a6480e9719b272b24d0c4d08a943ad79,,,

Several factors are known to increase an individualâ€™s risk for KSD including obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and poor nutrition; interestingly, each of these factors has a well-documented association with the human gut microbiome both in terms of taxonomic composition and metabolic capacity. In this study we applied high-resolution gut microbiome analysis to identify significant shifts in bacterial species composition and associated functional gene content between kidney stone formers and non-stone forming controls. METHODS: 16S rRNA amplicon sequences generated by the Illumina MiSeq platform were filtered for quality and contaminants, and subsequently analyzed using the Resphera Insight algorithm for highresolution taxonomic assignment. Species abundances were then assessed for significant enrichment or depletion in stone formers relative to controls utilizing the negative binomial test followed by False Discovery Rate p-value adjustment. Functional gene content was also assessed with PICRUSt. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients with KSD and six non-stoneforming controls maintained an average of 3,893 sequences per sample. Species-level profiling with Resphera Insight revealed significantly different levels of several species including 90% reductions of Prevotella buccalis and Prevotella corporis in the KSD group (adj.P<0.01). We also observe relative increases of Bacteroides and Clostridia species in KSD patients including a 27-fold increase in Bacteroides acidifaciens (adj.P1â„41e-6), and a 40-fold increase in Clostridium ramosum (adj.P1â„46e-12). Functional characterization identified KEGG pathways enriched in KSD relative to controls, including primary and secondary bile acid synthesis (P1â„40.001), a 3-fold increase in steroid hormone synthesis (P1â„40.007), as well as fructose metabolism, galactose metabolism and glycosaminoglycan degradation. CONCLUSIONS: KSD patients maintain significantly higher levels of specific Bacteroides and Clostridia species and significantly lower Prevotella species as compared to controls. Enrichments in multiple categories of metabolism were also identified. The gut microbiome may interact with kidney stone formation and identification of pathways and species level bacteria may allow for directed studies that will in the future build upon these findings.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashraf Tamimi"", ids = ""40892637""); list(name = ""Eyal Kord"", ids = ""11627209""); list(name = ""Yishai Rapaport"", ids = ""1395258816""); list(name = ""Ramziya Abu hamad"", ids = ""40914272""); list(name = ""Shai Efrati"", ids = ""152440030""); list(name = ""Amnon Zisman"", ids = ""38363370""); list(name = ""Yoram I.

7882c67f555b761e10ecc70216db25382890d9d7,Automated Characterization of Stenosis in Invasive Coronary Angiography Images with Convolutional Neural Networks,"The determination of a coronary stenosis and its severity in current clinical workflow is typically accomplished manually via physician visual assessment (PVA) during invasive coronary angiography. While PVA has shown large inter-rater variability, the more reliable and accurate alternative of Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) is challenging to perform in real-time due to the busy workflow in cardiac catheterization laboratories. We propose a deep learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that automatically characterizes and analyzes coronary stenoses in real-time by automating clinical tasks performed during QCA. Our deep learning methods for localization, segmentation and classification of stenosis in still-frame invasive coronary angiography (ICA) images of the right coronary artery (RCA) achieve performance of 72.7% localization accuracy, 0.704 dice coefficient and 0.825 C-statistic in each respective task. Integrated in an end-to-end approach, our model's performance shows statistically significant improvement in false discovery rate over the current standard in real-time clinical stenosis assessment, PVA. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time an automated machine learning system has been developed that can implement tasks performed in QCA, and the first time an automated machine learning system has demonstrated significant improvement over the current clinical standard for rapid RCA stenosis analysis.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Benjamin Au"", ids = ""144528063""); list(name = ""Uri Shaham"", ids = ""1762788""); list(name = ""Sanket S.

The wet-dry phenotype was used to represent the reproductive status of the ewes, divided into two categories, dry (ewes that did not lamb or that lost a lamb) and wet (ewes that had lambed and had at least one suckling lamb). Wet-dry records were obtained from smallholder farmers (n = 176) and Nortier Research Farm (n = 131) for the 2014 breeding season. Ages of the ewes ranged from 1 year to 6+ years. Data from 307 individuals were analysed, of which 172 Dorpers and 4 White Dorpers were from smallholder sheep flocks and 48 Dorpers, 46 Namaqua Afrikaners, 26 South African Mutton Merinos, 4 South African Mutton Merino x Dorper and 7 Dorper x South African Mutton Merino crossbreds were from the research farm. A logistic regression model was fitted to adjust the data for the fixed effects of farm, breed, and age of the ewe and weight at mating as a covariate. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and inbreeding coefficient were estimated using PLINK. Association analysis was performed using the genome-wide efficient mixed-model association package (GEMMA) to determine whether any significant SNPs were associated with the wet-dry reproductive trait. The wet-dry phenotype differed significantly between the smallholder (0.63 Â± 0.04) and research farm flocks (0.79 Â± 0.04). Genome-wide LD across all populations was r 2 = 0.36. Dorpers from the smallholder flock exhibited rapid LD decay versus the resource ovine populations. Inbreeding levels were also lower for the smallholder flock (4 Â± 0.003%) versus the research flock (13 Â± 0.008%). No significant SNPs were identified after correction for false discovery rate. The heritability estimate for wet-dry using SNP information was 0.24. This estimate concurs with the literature and indicates the possibility of using genomic selection to improve reproduction in smallholder sheep flocks.

91a102549c7e38a7cc2fde219163e8cdbaaaf9b5,Identification of Genes and Pathways Associated with Acne Using Integrated Bioinformatics Methods,"Background: Acne is the most common skin inflammatory condition. The pathogenesis of acne is not fully understood. Aims: We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to select acne-associated genes and pathways. Methods: GSE53795 and GSE6475 datasets including data from lesional and nonlesional skin of acne patients were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lesions were identified following a false discovery rate <0.05 and | log2 fold change | â‰¥0.5. DEG-associated biological processes and pathways were identified. WGCNA analysis was performed to identify acne-associated modules. DEGs in the acne-associated modules were used for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Acne-associated candidate DEGs and pathways were identified together with items in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Results: A total of 2,140 and 1,190 DEGs were identified in GSE53795 and GSE6475 datasets, respectively, including 716 overlapping DEGs with similar expression profiles in the two datasets, which were clustered into 10 consensus modules. Two modules (brown and turquoise, 359 genes) were associated with acne phenotype. Of these 359 DEGs, 254 were enrolled in the PPI network. GSEA showed that these DEGs were associated with chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. After identification in CTD, one pathway Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and 24 acne-associated DEGs, including IL1R1, CXCL1, CXCR4, CCR1, CXCL2 and IL1Î², were identified as candidates associated with acne. Conclusion: Our results highlight the important roles of the proinflammatory cytokines including IL1Î², CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCR4, and CCR1 in acne pathogenesis or therapeutic management.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xianglan Li"", ids = ""121856673""); list(name = ""Yuxi Jia"", ids = ""50438879""); list(name = ""Sunan Wang"", ids = ""16230069""); list(name = ""Tianqi Meng"", ids = ""152375504""); list(name = ""Mingji Zhu"", ids = ""8879312"")",6ee59a0c354092ff8a56259ed0f47d759b3d1db2,c7ffdcbd1d09ae5d38c58488cbf2a5b55fa44cea; f13f58800649a2640054707c11da5549c5edf8ef; c169abbcf872a0f4bae43cf729a45286960e43ff; b106e566f4ff5a4d2c5d9347ee69d5feba3482e8; 03e7f5081f73e5dd43bb02939e10b648fa8a91a8; 530c8d991f2f1c2bb2f0fdca501c83e39600212e; 0369a5e1ab11f46979d4b61419884724a022d62e; ce0686db7628cf915ced5c5348f5e635087c2964; 6e1e6afb314f9c5a24d744252a30aa5efc313571; 6b29435f96dde6f7944bb078fd8f905e835e6a1c; 3b8dc854a75e5622482e60cb7d8c12702455956e; 9f04b78554a770c5c3863d49a19ece86d3f2cf8f; 226c0a98ed3d57e0d8b0cd5ce51490895faeec49; 9a1fd0f70a48fb441f3cfacf5b185cb81f504bf4; 02b1c980cc1236f7529da5f0047351c721d73124; 6c6c69653a7b734492451cea9726036334039411; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 046adfe5c91b855ca42049a6da44f08ecd6871b4; 367aacce3d30a9f76cc5c5a54f91cd29df7d236b; fa42d206f44d6a14b556884435cfa49a75ca0cb8; f0bf180d36a62c1180bf420e22bb03204cd47b0b; 99daf48802e8241e8e0d20eb84b4ea650cc8a06a; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 4525670f1965d45986cbbf309e500e5f001959e4; c4bc07e73bfd2ff3e2635d85a7ffd5f4096c1587; 0b12180ee883250e41265d939ec25d566fe2a0ca; b9b173f8459c624f714e583a390268f509c51118; 81f46998df3e7bfb1bbebc1e95607842dedde3d5; 194b009c32fc7d5dfa5f1938b1c55899aa2bf9d8; a87c6ab9d7b2b939859bac4b15f2fc5c6a770d8b; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; 69904a52e38c2c65e7ef7a1b1c92843814d82ae5; dee351f96a0a7b9da6ce156c06c6b8654d8a09ec; 086e929eaa7b25f2f6dc06dc8e1aaf32e4031759; 4579570c379fe6fd403a1cf6672e60952a2faa09; be9fd771e18d6a2fc77737bcc2a24ce3d3880e98,Dermatology,235,445 - 455

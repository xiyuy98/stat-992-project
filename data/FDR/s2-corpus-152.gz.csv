Background: Although breast cancer in young women (YW) only accounts for âˆ¼7% of cases diagnosed annually, tumors in young patients have more aggressive characteristics and higher mortality rates. The cost of breast cancer increases significantly with more aggressive tumors in terms of treatment costs, physical and psychosocial effects on the patient and her family, and lost productivity. Improved understanding of factors associated with etiology and outcome of breast cancer in YW is critical to developing more effective prevention strategies and improved treatments, reducing the burden of breast cancer in this population.

Methods: The Clinical Breast Care Project (CBCP) database was queried to identify all female patients with invasive breast cancer diagnosed before 40 years (YW) and between 50-65 years (post-menopausal women, PMW). Pathological characteristics from both groups were compared using chi-square analysis with P<0.05 defining significance. Gene expression data was generated using U133 2.0 arrays from tumors from a subset of 76 patients matched by subtype, grade and stage. ANOVA analysis was used to detect differentially expressed genes with a False Discovery Rate <0.05, 2-fold difference used to define significance.

Results: YW represented 6% (89/1434) of the female invasive cancer population of the CBCP. YW were significantly more likely to be of African American ancestry (27%) compared to PMW (14%). Tumors from YW were significantly more likely to be hormone receptor negative, higher stage and grade, larger and more likely to have positive lymph node status and significantly less likely to be ER+/HER2-. Cancer mortality rates were significantly higher in YW (12%) compared to PMW (3%). Gene expression analysis, however, failed to identify any differentially expressed genes in subtype, grade and stage-matched tumors between YW and PMW.

Conclusions: Outcomes in YW with breast cancer are less favorable than those in PMW. Gene expression analysis suggests that tumors from YW are not molecularly different from those from PMW and thus tumors from YW do not represent a unique disease entity. Rather, higher stage and tumor size at diagnosis due to lack of screening in combination with increased incidence of more aggressive subtypes is likely driving higher mortality rates. Identification of epidemiological and/or genetic factors contributing to the etiology of aggressive tumors in conjunction with evaluation of possible treatment differences may reduce outcome disparities by decreasing the incidence of and improving treatment for breast cancer in young women.

440f3dfd2ada08069203c9d55dd0a70f357142db,Analysis of 13 cell types reveals evidence for the expression of numerous novel primate- and tissue-specific microRNAs.,"Two decades after the discovery of the first animal microRNA (miRNA), the number of miRNAs in animal genomes remains a vexing question. Here, we report findings from analyzing 1,323 short RNA sequencing samples (RNA-seq) from 13 different human tissue types. Using stringent thresholding criteria, we identified 3,707 statistically significant novel mature miRNAs at a false discovery rate of â‰¤ 0.05 arising from 3,494 novel precursors; 91.5% of these novel miRNAs were identified independently in 10 or more of the processed samples. Analysis of these novel miRNAs revealed tissue-specific dependencies and a commensurate low Jaccard similarity index in intertissue comparisons. Of these novel miRNAs, 1,657 (45%) were identified in 43 datasets that were generated by cross-linking followed by Argonaute immunoprecipitation and sequencing (Ago CLIP-seq) and represented 3 of the 13 tissues, indicating that these miRNAs are active in the RNA interference pathway. Moreover, experimental investigation through stem-loop PCR of a random collection of newly discovered miRNAs in 12 cell lines representing 5 tissues confirmed their presence and tissue dependence. Among the newly identified miRNAs are many novel miRNA clusters, new members of known miRNA clusters, previously unreported products from uncharacterized arms of miRNA precursors, and previously unrecognized paralogues of functionally important miRNA families (e.g., miR-15/107). Examination of the sequence conservation across vertebrate and invertebrate organisms showed 56.7% of the newly discovered miRNAs to be human-specific whereas the majority (94.4%) are primate lineage-specific. Our findings suggest that the repertoire of human miRNAs is far more extensive than currently represented by public repositories and that there is a significant number of lineage- and/or tissue-specific miRNAs that are uncharacterized.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric Londin"", ids = ""4340281""); list(name = ""Phillipe Loher"", ids = ""1995617""); list(name = ""Aristeidis G.

289d8c6f6fb3ad884de9664294ad9bcd982637cd,Characterization of the myometrial transcriptome in women with an arrest of dilatation during labor,"Abstract Objective: The molecular basis of failure to progress in labor is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to characterize the myometrial transcriptome of patients with an arrest of dilatation (AODIL). Study design: Human myometrium was prospectively collected from women in the following groups: (1) spontaneous term labor (TL; n=29) and (2) arrest of dilatation (AODIL; n=14). Gene expression was characterized using IlluminaÂ® HumanHT-12 microarrays. A moderated Studentâ€™s t-test and false discovery rate adjustment were used for analysis. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of selected genes was performed in an independent sample set. Pathway analysis was performed on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database using Pathway Analysis with Down-weighting of Overlapping Genes (PADOG). The MetaCore knowledge base was also searched for pathway analysis. Results: (1) Forty-two differentially expressed genes were identified in women with an AODIL; (2) gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment of biological processes, which included regulation of angiogenesis, response to hypoxia, inflammatory response, and chemokine-mediated signaling pathway. Enriched molecular functions included transcription repressor activity, heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 binding, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity; (3) MetaCore analysis identified immune response chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) signaling, muscle contraction regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in endothelial cells, and triiodothyronine and thyroxine signaling as significantly overrepresented (false discovery rate <0.05); (4) qRT-PCR confirmed the overexpression of Nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3); hypoxic ischemic factor 1A (HIF1A); Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2); angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4); ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1, motif 9 (ADAMTS9); G protein-coupled receptor 4 (GPR4); metallothionein 1A (MT1A); MT2A; and selectin E (SELE) in an AODIL. Conclusion: The myometrium of women with AODIL has a stereotypic transcriptome profile. This disorder has been associated with a pattern of gene expression involved in muscle contraction, an inflammatory response, and hypoxia. This is the first comprehensive and unbiased examination of the molecular basis of an AODIL.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Piya Chaemsaithong"", ids = ""6809143""); list(name = ""Ichchha Madan"", ids = ""33824905""); list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783429""); list(name = ""Nandor Gabor Than"", ids = ""3233577""); list(name = ""Adi L Tarca"", ids = ""2490889""); list(name = ""Sorin Draghici"", ids = ""1775019""); list(name = ""Gaurav Bhatti"", ids = ""144729467""); list(name = ""Lami Yeo"", ids = ""144354915""); list(name = ""Moshe Mazor"", ids = ""3509258""); list(name = ""Chong Jai Kim"", ids = ""34149625""); list(name = ""Sonia S.

3457db1006ef23b65cd7b21af8b91527de67aac4,Lipoprotein subclass metabolism in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with increased synthesis of triglycerides and cholesterol coupled with increased VLDL synthesis in the liver. In addition, increased cholesterol content in the liver associates with NASH. Here we study the association of lipoprotein subclass metabolism with NASH. To this aim, liver biopsies from 116 morbidly obese individuals [age 47.3 Â± 8.7 (mean Â± SD) years, BMI 45.1 Â± 6.1 kg/mÂ², 39 men and 77 women] were used for histological assessment. Proton NMR spectroscopy was used to measure lipid concentrations of 14 lipoprotein subclasses in native serum samples at baseline and after obesity surgery. We observed that total lipid concentration of VLDL and LDL subclasses, but not HDL subclasses, associated with NASH [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1]. More specifically, total lipid and cholesterol concentration of VLDL and LDL subclasses associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and cell injury (FDR < 0.1), independent of steatosis. Cholesterol concentration of all VLDL subclasses also correlated with total and free cholesterol content in the liver. All NASH-related changes in lipoprotein subclasses were reversed by obesity surgery. High total lipid and cholesterol concentration of serum VLDL and LDL subclasses are linked to cholesterol accumulation in the liver and to liver cell injury in NASH.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ville T.

467966480503191520274a4b865ed23ba0594977,False discovery rate control with multivariate p-values,"Multivariate statistics are often available as well as necessary in hypothesis tests. We study how to use such statistics to control not only false discovery rate (FDR) but also positive FDR (pFDR) with good power. We show that FDR can be controlled through nested regions of multivari- ate p-values of test statistics. If the distributions of the test statistics are known, then the regions can be constructed explicitly to achieve FDR con- trol with maximum power among procedures satisfying certain conditions. On the other hand, our focus is where the distributions are only partially known. Under certain conditions, a type of nested regions are proposed and shown to attain (p)FDR control with asymptotically maximum power as the pFDR control level approaches its attainable limit. The procedure based on the nested regions is compared with those based on other nested regions that are easier to construct as well as those based on more straightforward combinations of the test statistics.

0728e6a8a64ba04c65d94bec2d3935065823c499,Profiling of microRNA-mRNA reveals roles of microRNAs in cervical cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women. This study was designed to explore the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs and the gene regulation network in cervical tumorigenesis and to find candidate molecular markers and key tumorigenic genes in cervical cancer.


METHODS
miRNAs and mRNAs expression microarrays were used to detect the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs in normal and cancer cervical tissues. TargetScan 5.0 database (UK) was used to predict the target genes of the miRNAs, analyze their intersection with differentially expressed mRNAs and negatively correlate the intersection with miRNAs. Bioinformatic approaches were used to analyze functions and pathways of the target genes and establish miRNA-gene network.


RESULTS
Twenty-nine miRNAs and 2036 mRNAs were differentially expressed in normal and cervical tumor tissues. Among them, 13 miRNAs and 754 mRNAs were up-regulated in cervical tumor tissues and 16 miRNAs and 1282 RNA were down-regulated. The 327 target genes negatively related to miRNAs in the intersection were involved in functions and signal pathways. Down-regulated miRNAs targeted genes and up-regulated miRNAs targeted genes were involved in 415 and 163 functions, respectively, and in 37 and 17 significant pathways, respectively (P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). We constructed the miRNAs-gene network and found that hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-106b and hsa-miR-20b were key nodes in the network.


CONCLUSIONS
The differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in cervical cancer and related miRNA-gene network have been identified. They play important roles in cervical tumorigenesis and are involved in many important biological functions and signal transduction pathways. These findings lay a foundation for research on the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ding Ma"", ids = ""46604903""); list(name = ""You-yi Zhang"", ids = ""46868840""); list(name = ""Yan-li Guo"", ids = ""8716376""); list(name = ""Zi-jian Li"", ids = ""143694134""); list(name = ""Li Geng"", ids = ""49976314"")",98b30d4e66212f3bc94741f68af5216dc56fc250; a687f778d45bdbac7cb0a921f7038468cc4f8fcc; b801a53293548ecbcfe650a83592d86096676d5b; 505c0c21f7cd567f2d3c150f436ffeaa82338655; eb2a2d0829563af6af7d5839e622d4ff1d4d2e98; 3b3c003533113cf7b1a6a2480c3ed02f7dc1bab1; 31058e50a4bb82fb7eb83f4b51f359a831158637; 2859bce5a875eb30a667108393ece608734c16e3; 6abef2ac360a2434a2d30172a8e6151a58cf1540; c35119111b4e57e2c2d185f8f838f8bc76bcea43; 39f0425b8d533626d62f6adbc9d0c9a621ff3c2a; d4b595dc82bf3f0b79debb701dbaa4cb2d14e344; ccb5fae542f1d32a73277eaeb667b4da24b4010f; 4c4b01b255eedb6de5f9434999487e83eb724c83; 1538ab0600ee72b4105798198d55df3ea86272fc; 4b2b2d6e20ae2801dd041d00cb634ec9d77bbb83; 7ee5e733ec6d0e31eede433b3452231f3e8456ec; 33d2fb7067e457a03d012d842595a57285d7ea00; be353f7c3504dda74f1579202349cdbf54939612; 9fea74beda105fb2b982dfc7047d2344e631c44a; 6a1a02c76c44233e04ff22b12620531d3dd14fbd; e0aaab4b629f9d52d47d88fd1ddf65143a5b6c03; 26d023a47f72f24de3d22849caa5326bdfa1581c; 3e4f7abb33caecdde686b39002dce2c888b26aee; cb72c03517f16d11d39f993813103717463e3e1a; 6e7b24fb69af4e69edfcae8224d0f8d8855adbfa; 6ff2b8b77b39b8b38418e905af9c77592bf4daae; e6dc1b4a299fbffd2340566441d8c6ec32b917d3; 5ad71ba09cdfd5ae1bf359d1857a867ecd0874b1; 927b9b3cff7d58910447a7442e9c4a3fbdd0b7e2,,Chinese medical journal,125 23,"

ef52d58d82f65ce309c682e2e15c24ce05daf5bc,Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) treatment to measure hepatocellular proliferation does not mask furan-induced gene expression changes in mouse liver.,"Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is a synthetic nucleoside used to detect cellular proliferation. BrdU incorporates in the place of thymine but pairs with guanine, thereby increasing the risk of transition mutations in dividing cells. Given its mutagenicity, standard practice is to use a second cohort of animals for parallel toxicogenomics studies; however, the impact of BrdU on global gene expression is unknown. To test this, we performed a case study to determine whether the molecular mode of action of furan, a liver carcinogen, could be detected in BrdU-treated samples. We measure global hepatic gene expression using Agilent DNA microarrays in female B6C3F1 mice that were sub-chronically exposed to 0, 1, 4, or 8mg/kg bodyweight (bw) per day furan either in the presence (+BrdU) or absence (-BrdU) of BrdU. Exposure to 0.02% BrdU in drinking water for five days resulted in minimal gene expression changes. A comparison of +BrdU versus -BrdU control mice revealed only 11 probes with fold changeâ‰¥1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected pâ‰¤0.05. The same comparison in the high dose group yielded only 3 differentially expressed probes. Differentially expressed gene lists generated for furan-treated versus control mice and were compared for the -BrdU and +BrdU groups. The high dose of furan had 452 shared probes and 27 and 90 unique probes for -BrdU and +BrdU groups, respectively. These differences did not impact hierarchical clustering. Further, they did not impair detection of the previously reported furan mode of action, which was well represented in the BrdU-treated samples. Taken together, we demonstrate that BrdU treatment does not mask important furan-induced transcriptional changes. We suggest that BrdU-treated mice could be used for toxicogenomic analysis, which would generally halve the number of rodents required for toxicogenomics studies. However, we also recommend that this type of case study be repeated for other chemicals before the use of BrdU-treated animals in omics studies becomes common practice.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Anna Francina Webster"", ids = ""31490781""); list(name = ""Andrew Williams"", ids = ""65784138""); list(name = ""Leslie Recio"", ids = ""143874354""); list(name = ""Carole L.

95b487a2ae5675332af9f1425eaabb4fffa87716,OC-033 Nine-Gene Signature Implicated in the Early Development of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC),"Introduction HCV remains the commonest cause of HCC related deaths in the west. Dysplastic nodules (DN) harbour highly relevant genomic information based on its strong potential to progress to HCC. Copy number alterations (CNA) have not been previously studied in a large cohort of HCV related DN. In this study we used next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify potential drivers of oncogenesis in a cohort of HCV related DNs and HCCs. Methods We performed low coverage next generation DNA sequencing of 116 HCCs and 49 DNs from 63 HCV infected patients to investigate their CNA profiles. Patients with a mixed aetiology of liver disease were excluded. Significant copy number gain and loss peaks were identified using GISTIC 2.0. To identify driver from passenger alterations, we stratified the peaks according to their amplitude and frequency within included samples. We also identified peaks that were inclusive of genes causally implicated in cancer, highly associated with cancer or involved in major cell signalling pathways. We further analysed the HCC-related peaks and correlated each of them to patient and tumour clinical features. This correlation was corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Results We identified 86 and 79 significant CNA peaks in HCC and DN respectively. The peaks were further stratified as described above which lead to recognition of a 9 gene signature highly implicated in early HCV related HCC. This included losses of ROCK1, CARS, SBDS, DUX4 and gains of NCOA2, MYC, TPO, YWHAZ and MCM4. Our data confirmed the alteration of 51 other genes in HCC but not DN. This included gains of CCND1, NFKB1/2, MUC1, FGF2/4/19 and CKS1B and losses of CDKN2A/B, KRAS, PTEN, RB1, NOTCH1, CCNA2, BMPR1B which have previously been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Out of 86 HCC-related peaks, 16/86 had significant associations with clinical features after correction for FDR. Six of the above 16 peaks overlapped with 6 out of the 9 gene signature we previously identified. Genomic features strongly correlated with tumour differentiation, number of tumours per liver and overall survival. No association was found between HCV genotype or PCR quantity. Conclusion Analysis of DNA copy number profiles of a large number of HCV related DN and HCC using NGS revealed a signature of 9 genes likely to be implicated as drivers in the early development of this cancer. Our study generates a valid hypothesis and further studies are needed to confirm causality. Disclosure of Interest W. Fateen: None Declared, H. Wood: None Declared, S. Berri Employee of: Illumina, H.

dac1eff6fe83a2b9370337b48a11a71165eba693,Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data by incorporating non-exonic mapped reads,"BackgroundRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool for genome-wide expression profiling of biological samples with the advantage of high-throughput and high resolution. There are many existing algorithms nowadays for quantifying expression levels and detecting differential gene expression, but none of them takes the misaligned reads that are mapped to non-exonic regions into account. We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was established based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of true expression signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are considered as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution. Given measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression signals, assuming governed by the negative binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus the accurate detection of differential expressed genes.ResultsWe implemented our novel XBSeq algorithm and evaluated it by using a set of simulated expression datasets under different conditions, using a combination of negative binomial and Poisson distributions with parameters derived from real RNA-seq data. We compared the performance of our method with other commonly used differential expression analysis algorithms. We also evaluated the changes in true and false positive rates with variations in biological replicates, differential fold changes, and expression levels in non-exonic regions. We also tested the algorithm on a set of real RNA-seq data where the common and different detection results from different algorithms were reported.ConclusionsIn this paper, we proposed a novel XBSeq, a differential expression analysis algorithm for RNA-seq data that takes non-exonic mapped reads into consideration. When background noise is at baseline level, the performance of XBSeq and DESeq are mostly equivalent. However, our method surpasses DESeq and other algorithms with the increase of non-exonic mapped reads. Only in very low read count condition XBSeq had a slightly higher false discovery rate, which may be improved by adjusting the background noise effect in this situation. Taken together, by considering non-exonic mapped reads, XBSeq can provide accurate expression measurement and thus detect differential expressed genes even in noisy conditions.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hung-I Harry Chen"", ids = ""1898847""); list(name = ""Yuanhang Liu"", ids = ""7895719""); list(name = ""Yi Zou"", ids = ""144478586""); list(name = ""Zhao Lai"", ids = ""47715081""); list(name = ""Devanand Sarkar"", ids = ""117714404""); list(name = ""Yufei Huang"", ids = ""9221105""); list(name = ""Yidong Chen"", ids = ""144170551"")",a3a6959af2d3fb6a817e973953f69daefce8f777; d4b1048ad00ad3eef84c99629bbb754fe83cb624; dac1eff6fe83a2b9370337b48a11a71165eba693; 02d505d154c8a5a727c47990b798922e1cbc9d01,35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; 0141c5e6f271f98722904c30d3ae9fd348bd7204; b28f2c2c5972d3e37458e1e851a725273bc96e67; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; c6fbd16f76ec95a0cc24a0d7e1d2b2ab3d0a1cb6; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; dac1eff6fe83a2b9370337b48a11a71165eba693; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 7cd9947804654e3aa395ca8f8ee3d140923fc3a5; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 0b1de7cf741a1573b7de8fab96e5df1a7ede3543; 76185686d188fe7b8cd36f916d4fd5e4634165a3; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; c4cb1fe15622de3a02ee3e89fc30dbe583439ee8; 2c4272e5dd8a6f54caae33fec533ad5fc133c8c7; 6a16851303fee5be59529496e06e5b8f9d5fed78; c6439f2ebafcce664c2539439b3d69ddd2d0be17,BMC Genomics,16,S14 - S14
cc51c79f4172e8c7691475058dc50426bfb5d9fa,A method for calling gains and losses in array CGH data.,"Array CGH is a powerful technique for genomic studies of cancer. It enables one to carry out genome-wide screening for regions of genetic alterations, such as chromosome gains and losses, or localized amplifications and deletions. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm 'Cluster along chromosomes' (CLAC) for the analysis of array CGH data. CLAC builds hierarchical clustering-style trees along each chromosome arm (or chromosome), and then selects the 'interesting' clusters by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a certain level. In addition, it provides a consensus summary across a set of arrays, as well as an estimate of the corresponding FDR. We illustrate the method using an application of CLAC on a lung cancer microarray CGH data set as well as a BAC array CGH data set of aneuploid cell strains.",2005,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pei Yong Wang"", ids = ""30924945""); list(name = ""Young Ho Kim"", ids = ""50682336""); list(name = ""Jonathan R.

b4fb9c4ff13f8cfaefa36ebaa3df0e48c0604639,Identification of novel common variants associated with chronic pain using conditional false discovery rate analysis with major depressive disorder and assessment of pleiotropic effects of LRFN5,"Chronic pain is a complex trait that is moderately heritable and genetically, as well as phenotypically, correlated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Use of the conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach, which leverages pleiotropy identified from existing GWAS outputs, has been successful in discovering novel associated variants in related phenotypes. Here, genome-wide association study outputs for both von Korff chronic pain grade and for MDD were used to identify variants meeting a cFDR threshold for each outcome phenotype separately, as well as a conjunctional cFDR (ccFDR) threshold for both phenotypes together. Using a moderately conservative threshold, we identified a total of 11 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six of which were associated with chronic pain grade and nine of which were associated with MDD. Four SNPs on chromosome 14 were associated with both chronic pain grade and MDD. SNPs associated only with chronic pain grade were located within SLC16A7 on chromosome 12. SNPs associated only with MDD were located either in a gene-dense region on chromosome 1 harbouring LINC01360, LRRIQ3, FPGT and FPGT-TNNI3K, or within/close to LRFN5 on chromosome 14. The SNPs associated with both outcomes were also located within LRFN5. Several of the SNPs on chromosomes 1 and 14 were identified as being associated with expression levels of nearby genes in the brain and central nervous system. Overall, using the cFDR approach, we identified several novel genetic loci associated with chronic pain and we describe likely pleiotropic effects of a recently identified MDD locus on chronic pain.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Keira J A Johnston"", ids = ""40004644""); list(name = ""Mark James Adams"", ids = ""35161645""); list(name = ""Barbara I.

ea22a21437afded4f7af0b4d5eb92444f5aec0ac,Simultaneous tests for patterned recognition using nonparametric partially sequential procedure,"In the present paper we introduce a partially sequential sampling procedure to develop a nonparametric method for simultaneous testing. Our work, as in [U. Bandyopadhyay, A. Mukherjee, B. Purkait,Nonparametric partial sequential tests for patterned alternatives in multi-sample problems, Sequential Analysis 26 (4) (2007) 443-466], is motivated by an interesting investigation related to arsenic contamination in ground water. Here we incorporate the idea of multiple hypotheses testing as in [Y. Benjamini, T. Hochberg, Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, Journal of Royal Statistical Society B 85 (1995) 289-300] in a typical way.We present some Monte Carlo studies related to the proposed procedure. We observe that the proposed sampling design minimizes the expected sample sizes in different situations. The procedure as a whole effectively describes the testing under dual pattern alternatives. We indicate in brief some large sample situations.

94cc79a9fece3ca3ff70469d7186ac6e01696fbb,A Major Histocompatibility Class I Locus Contributes to Multiple Sclerosis Susceptibility Independently from HLA-DRB1*15:01,"BACKGROUND
In Northern European descended populations, genetic susceptibility for multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II gene DRB1. Whether other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes contribute to MS susceptibility is controversial.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
A case control analysis was performed using 958 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the MHC assayed in two independent datasets. The discovery dataset consisted of 1,018 cases and 1,795 controls and the replication dataset was composed of 1,343 cases and 1,379 controls. The most significantly MS-associated SNP in the discovery dataset was rs3135391, a Class II SNP known to tag the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele, the primary MS susceptibility allele in the MHC (O.R. = 3.04, p < 1 x 10(-78)). To control for the effects of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype, case control analysis was performed adjusting for this HLA-DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP. After correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate = .05) 52 SNPs in the Class I, II and III regions were significantly associated with MS susceptibility in both datasets using the Cochran Armitage trend test. The discovery and replication datasets were merged and subjects carrying the HLA-DRB1*15:01 tagging SNP were excluded. Association tests showed that 48 of the 52 replicated SNPs retained significant associations with MS susceptibility independently of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 as defined by the tagging SNP. 20 Class I SNPs were associated with MS susceptibility with p-values < or = 1 x 10(-8). The most significantly associated SNP was rs4959039, a SNP in the downstream un-translated region of the non-classical HLA-G gene (Odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.40, 1.81, p = 8.45 x 10(-13)) and is in linkage disequilibrium with several nearby SNPs. Logistic regression modeling showed that this SNP's contribution to MS susceptibility was independent of the Class II and Class III SNPs identified in this screen.

A MHC Class I locus contributes to MS susceptibility independently of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 haplotype.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bruce A C Cree"", ids = ""145391988""); list(name = ""John D Rioux"", ids = ""3170817""); list(name = ""Jacob L.

Here we identify through this high-coverage sequencing (32.4 Ã— on average), 21.2 million, including 12 million novel, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at an estimated false discovery rate of <1.0%. This detailed analysis detected signatures for purifying selection on regulatory elements as well as coding regions. We also catalogue structural variants, including 3.4 million insertions and deletions, and 25,923 genic copy-number variants. The 1KJPN was effective for imputing genotypes of the Japanese population genome wide. These data demonstrate the value of high-coverage sequencing for constructing population-specific variant panels, which covers 99.0% SNVs of minor allele frequency â‰¥0.1%, and its value for identifying causal rare variants of complex human disease phenotypes in genetic association studies.",2015,Biology;

b96d0b28e6d9af05ede4a231e05dcae557c083c4,Genome-wide copy number variant analysis reveals variants associated with 10 diverse production traits in Holstein cattle,"BackgroundCopy number variation (CNV) is an important type of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences among mammals and may serve as an alternative molecular marker to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for genome-wide association study (GWAS). Recently, GWAS analysis using CNV has been applied in livestock, although few studies have focused on Holstein cattle.ResultsWe describe 191 CNV detected using intensity data from over 700,000 SNP genotypes generated with the BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in 528 Holstein cows. The CNV were used for GWAS analysis of 10 important production traits of 473 cattle related to feed intake, milk quality, and female fertility, as well as 2 composite traits of net merit and productive life. In total, we detected 57 CNV associated (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 after false discovery rate correction) with at least one of the 10 phenotypes. Focusing on feed efficiency and intake-related phenotypes of residual feed intake and dry matter intake, we detected a single CNV associated with both traits which overlaps a predicted olfactory receptor gene OR2A2 (LOC787786). Additionally, 2 CNV within the RXFP4 (relaxin/insulin like family peptide receptor 4) and 2 additional olfactory receptor gene regions, respectively, were associated with residual feed intake. The RXFP4 gene encodes a receptor for an orexigenic peptide, insulin-like peptide 5 produced by intestinal L cells, which is expressed by enteric neurons. Olfactory receptors are critical for transmitting the effects of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell, and have been implicated in participating in appetite regulation.ConclusionsOur results identify CNV for genomic evaluation in Holstein cattle, and provide candidate genes, such as RXFP4, contributing to variation in feed efficiency and feed intake-related traits. These results indicate potential novel targets for manipulating feed intake-related traits of livestock.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Zhou"", ids = ""19989278""); list(name = ""Erin E.

0d23b9a75bdf37795063ece69e46d69dd9bd5fe0,"Combined genetic, genomic and transcriptomic methods in the analysis of animal traits","This paper reviews advances and current status in genetic, genomic and transcriptomic investigations of quantitative traits in livestock species and proposes possible strategies for integrating the vast amounts of information (outputs/datasets) arising from all three investigations into a systems genetics approach. This systems genetics approach is characterized by investigations of the genetic basis of -omic variations and gene regulatory/co-regulatory networks. This review is structured as follows. Genetics/genomics, transcriptomics, combined transcriptomicsâ€“genomics and, finally, systems genetics/biology. In the genetics or genomics part, we discuss current status and advances in quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping to fine-map multiple causative/candidate genes. We discuss the potential of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays (e.g. Affymetrix GeneChip 1 arrays) to identify SNPâ€“trait associations and fine-map QTLs to less than 0.1 cM. We provide references and resources for SNP analytical methods and tools. In the transcriptomics part, we formulate common biological questions relevant to livestock microarray gene expression profiling (MGEP) experiments to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the combined transcriptomicsâ€“genomics (known as genetical genomics), we discuss detection and mapping of expression QTL (eQTL) that harbour regulatory genes for normal trait QTLs or candidate genes detected under â€˜geneticsâ€™ and â€˜genomicsâ€™ approaches. Illustrations from our own recent genetical genomic investigations in mouse and pigs are provided. One of the current challenges in genetical genomics is to have a coherent approach to design an experiment with due considerations for sample size and controlling false discovery rates (FDRs), while maintaining statistical power to detect eQTLs. Here we provide some concepts for the design of genetical genomics experiments with factors affecting FDR and power. This is followed by a systems biology/genetics section where we focus on combining research outputs from four different sources, namely: genetics or genomics (e.g. SNP, QTL and eQTLs), transcriptomics (e.g. DE genes, gene networks, and heritability of gene transcripts) and phenomics (e.g. phenotypes and pedigree). As a proof of principle, we provide results from systems biology/genetics approach anchored to a gene network for myogenin (MYOG), a muscle-specific transcription factor essential for the development of skeletal muscle. Using bovine expression datasets and in silico approaches, we built a gene network for MYOG that represents 35 significant connections between genes in this network. In conclusion, this paper provides strategies and tools to integrate data from genetics and -omics experiments in animals and highlighted the value of such â€˜systems geneticsâ€™ strategy in understanding the genetics of complex traits.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Haja N.

65fcf00b515cd8e18f4eb8ac9ed008596fa30f14,Multiple hypothesis testing to detect lineages under positive selection that affects only a few sites.,"Detection of positive Darwinian selection has become ever more important with the rapid growth of genomic data sets. Recent branch-site models of codon substitution account for variation of selective pressure over branches on the tree and across sites in the sequence and provide a means to detect short episodes of molecular adaptation affecting just a few sites. In likelihood ratio tests based on such models, the branches to be tested for positive selection have to be specified a priori. In the absence of a biological hypothesis to designate so-called foreground branches, one may test many branches, but a correction for multiple testing becomes necessary. In this paper, we employ computer simulation to evaluate the performance of 6 multiple test correction procedures when the branch-site models are used to test every branch on the phylogeny for positive selection. Four of the methods control the familywise error rates (FWERs), whereas the other 2 control the false discovery rate (FDR). We found that all correction procedures achieved acceptable FWER except for extremely divergent sequences and serious model violations, when the test may become unreliable. The power of the test to detect positive selection is influenced by the strength of selection and the sequence divergence, with the highest power observed at intermediate divergences. The 4 correction procedures that control the FWER had similar power. We recommend Rom's procedure for its slightly higher power, but the simple Bonferroni correction is useable as well. The 2 correction procedures that control the FDR had slightly more power and also higher FWER. We demonstrate the multiple test procedures by analyzing gene sequences from the extracellular domain of the cluster of differentiation 2 (CD2) gene from 10 mammalian species. Both our simulation and real data analysis suggest that the multiple test procedures are useful when multiple branches have to be tested on the same data set.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria Anisimova"", ids = ""145047590"");

1fe444631d1ac4d84320c4f2ef581db317952183,Genetic variants in the MRPS30 region and postmenopausal breast cancer risk,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies have identified several genomic regions that are associated with breast cancer risk, but these provide an explanation for only a small fraction of familial breast cancer aggregation. Genotype by environment interactions may contribute further to such explanation, and may help to refine the genomic regions of interest.MethodsWe examined genotypes for 4,988 SNPs, selected from recent genome-wide studies, and four randomized hormonal and dietary interventions among 2,166 women who developed invasive breast cancer during the intervention phase of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial (1993 to 2005), and one-to-one matched controls. These SNPs derive from 3,224 genomic regions having pairwise squared correlation (r2) between adjacent regions less than 0.2. Breast cancer and SNP associations were identified using a test statistic that combined evidence of overall association with evidence for SNPs by intervention interaction.ResultsThe combined 'main effect' and interaction test led to a focus on two genomic regions, the fibroblast growth factor receptor two (FGFR2) and the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S30 (MRPS30) regions. The ranking of SNPs by significance level, based on this combined test, was rather different from that based on the main effect alone, and drew attention to the vicinities of rs3750817 in FGFR2 and rs7705343 in MRPS30. Specifically, rs7705343 was included with several FGFR2 SNPs in a group of SNPs having an estimated false discovery rate < 0.05. In further analyses, there were suggestions (nominal P < 0.05) that hormonal and dietary intervention hazard ratios varied with the number of minor alleles of rs7705343.ConclusionsGenotype by environment interaction information may help to define genomic regions relevant to disease risk. Combined main effect and intervention interaction analyses raise novel hypotheses concerning the MRPS30 genomic region and the effects of hormonal and dietary exposures on postmenopausal breast cancer risk.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Huang"", ids = ""48356004""); list(name = ""Dennis G.

Methods: We integrated published data defining regions of loss/gain identified from the profiling of 21 HNSCC using high-resolution ( ! 1 Mb) CGH arrays and data from an mRNA expression microarray (approx. 12,000 genes) comparing 6 normal tissues and 8 HNSCC tumor tissues. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C subunit 2 (EIF2C2) was found to be the most significantly overexpressed gene by mRNA expression array, and corresponded to the most common region of amplification found by the CGH array described by Sparano et al. We validated EIF2C2 overexpression in primary tissue, overexpression and amplification in HNSCC lines (JHU-011, JHU-012, FADU) relative to a minimally transformed oral keratinocyte cell line (OKF6) and performed knockdown experiments. Results: The tumor tissues had an average mRNA expression level of 123 (SD = 49) compared to the normal tissues (18.6, SD = 10) (p = 0.0005) by expression Received: June 23, 2010 Accepted: August 23, 2010 Published online: October 1, 2010 Joseph A.

Recent advances in microarray and cytogenetic technology have allowed for the analysis of the cancer genome with improved resolution. Specifically, using the array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technology, regions of loss/gain as small as ! 1 Mb can be detected throughout the entire genome simultaneously. A recent report by Sparano et al. [4] analyzed 21 oral squamous cell carcinomas using this new aCGH and discovered several novel regions of loss/gain. They reported that region 8q24.23â€“8q24.3 was the most common region of amplification in their cohort (62% of tumors) [4] . We hypothesized that areas of high-frequency amplification contain putative oncogenes. In a separate tumor cohort, we performed an mRNA expression array analysis of 8 HNSCC tumors and 6 normal tissues. Using an integrative method for gene discovery, the top gene of this array study was eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C subunit 2 ( EIF2C2 , Omim 606229), located within the region 8q24.23â€“8q24.3. EIF2C2 encodes a protein that is a member of the Argonaute family of proteins. These proteins are known to play a role in RNA interference. MicroRNA are non-coding RNA molecules that were found to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The encoded protein is a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a key factor in the microRNA, siRNA and RNAi processing pathway [5] . In summary, microRNA are transcribed from DNA into pre-microRNA, these molecules are then processed by Drosha in the nucleus and exported out of the nucleus by Exportin 5. Once exported from the nucleus, the microRNA are further processed by Dicer which produces the mature single-stranded form. Lastly, this mature microRNA associates with RISC and then binds to its target mRNA and inhibits translation by degradation of target mRNA and/or blockage of translation. EIF2C2 provides the endonuclease activity (also called â€˜slicerâ€™) to RISC by cleaving microRNA/mRNA heteroduplexes bound to RISC [5, 6] . There have been many studies implicating the role of microRNA in many malignancies by either overexpression or underexpression [7] . To validate the results of our integrative discovery approach, we performed functional studies using EIF2C2 in cell lines. After validating overexpression of EIF2C2 by RT-PCR in a separate cohort of HNSCC tumors, we demonstrated that EIF2C2 can modulate cellular proliferation using siRNA knockout experiments. Since EIF2C2 normally functions in the pathway of microRNA, it is possible that alterations in microRNA processing components may contribute toward a malignant phenotype. Methods Human Tissue Samples All human HNSCC tissue samples and normal mucosal tissues were obtained and used according to the policies of the JHMI institutional review board. Tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection. Microdissection of frozen tissue was performed to assure that more than 75% of tissue contained HNSCC. Microdissection was performed by a Johns Hopkins Hospital head and neck pathologist. Eight samples of HNSCC and 6 samples of normal oral epithelial tissue were used for the mRNA expression array (online suppl. table 1, www. karger.com/doi/10.1159/000320597). A separate cohort of 34 microdissected HNSCC tumors and 8 normal oral epithelial tissues was used for the validation studies. All normal tissues were derived from patients who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for obstructive sleep apnea. DNA and RNA Extraction Total RNA extraction from human tissue samples and cell lines was performed using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA). Methods used were as described by Chomczynski [8] and Chomczynski and Sacchi [9] . mRNA Expression Array and Significance Analysis of Microarray RNA was analyzed by human genome Affymetrix U133 1.0 mRNA expression array chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif., USA) which examines the expression of 12,000 genes simultaneously. A logarithmic transformation was then performed using the Snomad software. Final values for each sample, expressed as a Z score, were analyzed for significance using significance analysis of microarray (SAM). SAM was applied to expression array results that examined the 8 samples of primary HNSCC and 6 samples of normal control oral epithelial tissue. For SAM, a q value or false discovery rate was set at 0% to determine significantly differently expressed genes. Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR of Tissues and Cell Lines The PCR primers for quantitation of DNA used were as follows: left primer 3 -CTGCACAACACAGCCAGTCT-5 and right primer 3 -CCTTGTTCGTCTTGAGCTCC-5 . The RT-PCR primer sequences used to create cDNA were: left primer 3 GGAACATGACAGTGCTGAAGG-5 and right primer 3 AGTGGGATTCACGAGACCAG-5 . The DNA or cDNA was run in an Applied Biosystems Taqman 7900HT for quantitative RTPCR in triplicate under standard conditions. Copy number of EIF2C2 in human tissue and cell lines were determined by normalizing to GAPDH and BETA-ACTIN . Increased copy number or gene amplification was defined as any statistically significant increase in copy number of EIF2C2 relative to the control genes BETA-ACTIN or GAPDH . Expression level of EIF2C2 was normalized to BETA-ACTIN expression. Statistical significance of the tissue cohort was determined using 2-tailed Studentâ€™s t test assuming unequal variance. Statistical significance of the cell line results was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Quantitative PCR and RT-PCR of tissues were performed on the same tissue cohort.

(Austin, Tex., USA). Catalog numbers are: 19612 (siRNA1), 133832 (siRNA2), and 133831 (siRNA3). Negative controls were also purchased from Ambion, catalog number AM4635, and are RNA sequences that have been tested to assure limited sequence similarity to known genes. The concentrations of reagents for a 6-well plate were as follows: 100 pmol of the mimic, inhibitor or control were used in a volume of 500  l serum-free media with 5  l of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. For the pooled transfections, the total amount of each siRNA equaled 100 pmol such that for single and pooled transfections the total amount of siRNA was equal. Cells were transfected using Invitrogen Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Carlsbad, Calif., USA) 24 h after plating. Transfection complexes were prepared according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions and added directly to the cells. The transfection medium was replaced 24 h after transfection with normal growth media. Identical concentrations of reagents, cellular confluency and cell growth conditions were used for the control experiments. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm knockdown of EIF2C2 expression after transfection. The RNA was harvested 36 h after transfection of pooled siRNA. Each experiment was performed independently at least 3 times and in triplicate. Representative data are shown in the figures. Cell Proliferation Assay Cells were plated at a confluency of 50% per well of a 12-well plate. Growth was assayed at 24, 48, and 72 h by ATCC MTT cell proliferation assay (Manassas, Va., USA) after transfection. The standard manufacturer protocol was followed. Absorbance readings were determined by a fluorescence plate reader at 570 and 650 nm wavelengths. All samples were run in triplicate and replicated at least 3 times. Average readings were reported with standard error. The plate reader used was a SpectraMax M2e Microplate reader purchased from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, Calif., USA). Cell Lines and Culturing Conditions Cell lines were developed from primary HNSCC in the Division of Head and Neck Cancer Research at the Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Md., USA). Cell lines were derived from the following sites: larynx (JHU-O11), neck node metastasis (JHU-012) and pharynx (FaDu). Normal OKF6 cell lines (oral keratinocyte cells that were immortalized with hTert) are a minimally transformed oral keratinocyte line donated by Dr. James Rheinwald, Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard Skin Disease Research Center.

0ff20f9e0625bb8b472c61572dc518dc157c1e0f,Reduced plasma Fetuin-A is a promising biomarker of depression in the elderly,"Depression affects 7% of the elderly population, and it often remains misdiagnosed or untreated. Peripheral biomarkers might aid clinicians by allowing more accurate and well-timed recognition of the disease. We sought to determine if plasma protein levels predict the severity of depressive symptomatology or distinguish patients from healthy individuals. The severity of depressive symptoms and global cognitive functioning were assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in 152 elderly subjects, 76 of which with major depressive disorder (MDD). Plasma levels of 24 proteins were measured by multiplexing and analyzed as continuous predictors or dichotomized using the median value. The association between individual plasma proteins and MDD risk or depressive symptoms severity was investigated using multiple logistic and linear regressions including relevant covariates. Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding cognitively impaired individuals or non-acute patients with MDD. After adjusting for possible confounders and false discovery rate (FDR) correction, we found lower Fetuin-A levels in MDD patients vs. controls (pFDRâ€‰=â€‰1.95â€‰Ã—â€‰10â€“6). This result was confirmed by the sensitivity and dichotomized analyses. Lower prolactin (PRL) levels predicted more severe depressive symptoms in acute MDD patients (pFDRâ€‰=â€‰0.024). Fetuin-A is a promising biomarker of MDD in the elderly as this protein was negatively associated with the disorder in our sample, regardless of the global cognitive functioning. Lower PRL levels may be a peripheral signature of impaired neuroprotective processes and serotoninergic neurotransmission in more severely depressed patients.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Giuseppe Fanelli"", ids = ""49607829""); list(name = ""Francesco Benedetti"", ids = ""1388508244""); list(name = ""Sheng-Min Wang"", ids = ""123674656""); list(name = ""Soojung Lee"", ids = ""47090637""); list(name = ""Tae-Youn Jun"", ids = ""48120412""); list(name = ""Prakash S Masand"", ids = ""39830370""); list(name = ""Ashwin A Patkar"", ids = ""6924542""); list(name = ""Changsu Han"", ids = ""145366266""); list(name = ""Alessandro Serretti"", ids = ""2362348""); list(name = ""Chi-Un Pae"", ids = ""6896587""); list(name = ""Chiara Fabbri"", ids = ""3736284"")",,317bf8f246b8bbe06a1ba0c5bc7e1af41fabf720; df9980bae2006a37f6d844e7ff6d8e42f67cbefc; e390e197d3cb44cdba981a6dc68b85ae6afed0d2; 53f9986d319820978e7387f8598ad31bc3a24cdf; b760a11d5b095a691d22be315b947efc8d621307; dbe0eeb4fed32ddb58586d6da0950998d9291624; 06622bcafe19d0b455e0982ad8e7c68dd7678393; ca7721940828c49310bc708c8ba962af81cb39a6; 4627c2add4c358fc0bc59b6193c2a0d74e84d61a; 4410407889b9956ea601acd79fa7666255939202; f9e25ac6f19f02cbcb423aca6824b5c9a9045d46; 107bf3d8689c94d442dd6d263385d2e8641652e3; ba5d38cd0d14248ed3d989f81923dd4ab5703741; bfb2b00d5197f53d062932ccfdd8204be62cdf7a; 972da92d1d1c30f73982748aa5e221cd457e8c5d; 1ce48b18aaf4d4d03f22b4f4bd2a3bdaa36ee3ae; c2c2f0020162e7110a9424036498c63060dd180f; 9abddbae2d4127b65c253389c01b30ee130fd6d8; c51567ff28c58efeec62a5d84631e48ff55fb353; 3cdda0d73f69b8ea4c32f2b1cf28496b60dcb53a; f0b2c7fb39ecd400531b353b343487d6add63acc; ce9b24814f513ff9bbdf09bc59e7bf5378ac4030; 64d1885b3b6b4312348fe9ef0286c4a63b49bcc0; 75fc2e25a1ca8582a8786d7397834b3b0875d6f7; d2b027175a711e70a389d2b55fa7118dd69252bd; 65689405fabb4606a8fe0ef543ca9b70b1284c0a; c9c95c57757f4a67312dde746f999072d9852e3d; 870d9d1710b20e5db787c44f834b11e12156cd19; 9aec00f648ffb93cb25faf1ad71d710d8dc502ff; bb1585a3e4e21f584cda15dd712401d2632b923a; 9dd07983dc44efb28ac7b6b6f875505bc63f7c41; fc8b66de00437eb5165cc925555d9a4bc88f6061; c56e23cb338ef0a94598945d6cb483a0389c5d45; cb799e321be5e870deb0a9058b947635eec4015c; d12d1ebdb268497e6de3c283adcf022caed540ac; 504203aa8102cf9936b4b721cd89cd21f7a95db2; 83dbaff2055b2a783faaf87af7e012525fb77bd5; 0dccbbf4eb799945d00c6eab9cdcc584ab59a948; d1538f7b7d1c1f7f6619771940157166a3286f62; 12831e510b641ee9deed76ed5d74a57923c72671; 3d146953499b7852558878ec6fae12fc00575914; 5b98f7ea7f96d4b950facd7a8633828945d2151f; c68c8a1dab58d92ad50daa9501db7deb7177be6c; 93be2586bf392d0c83b5820fe88afca5129aaac8; 1ec7498fdebac5274f3e05e112d2ac4a3f29b5e9; 11b415bfb4fbcbf80d50a2794017e69bbffed32c; 852d8fded8394fa197d1cd502c23380b8d05b617; 0081adb29a00fff363236be20ad3a531a34bc2eb; aed0401e8ad8436ebba3ec6ab7617b11bb80a9af; 525b194f592273d9a7f581b5efb5bed548f6d2ff; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 935f0b8662db282619923e5edaec24138bb78877; 7579545cc5303da27bff44539e2fcc8d720c607a; 195237a1f429269e855eb7b2207fbd57b09dc372; 1de1a671c6b7347f0f6db1a7add3e644fffce9bf; 73fa92f1eac8a99be838f5ac85cde7e0d325031a; caf6f9051d28d5b16a8c532081777bca187c19e5; cdcd0a823ac531430951964467359127265cea02; 94329ac55fe4d61c9d337c9b6b53f68e87ee9897; e865be8aa32a84fe158f48e7d409861cbd857dfe; 5897551774b9912824d13e2d7d64600dcc08a148; 169f424649a31f97b6a838eb68e17a0327fef52e; 3e21a2cedb0cc125632f99c2c0de2159f2a52e69; f6bfed799b53c8aa2ff373b0bf3056d310e8cbc2; a77631e910540fc877a40104ba637dc5b35720bf; c9d36955d02062e4df04f251946d8f259449cdf9; 183a9d7fefad71aacd1490d6e75844c1f3304f75; 9270ed3b90d331b0eb2618c0de6ff731ddd56b4d; 9d00722adfe7b59169c634f995e23db5e10f1dff; e955df5c589f02bb16f460201ef6f94d8f9aa715; a38e814d800d9fcfcbd9ed7da82aaa5d7dc4d49f; 7bb580ee39436fe0d4a74afa01153af3a49f808e; 9475c46a7499f7a34da022e128d9c549a93fbf5f; 11839e5aaf23bbce4b95768f3440c5997a29577c; fb89c3164ee1820eb686b2d920f2efa942d62384; f043178c5153009501e06427296fc0c3cf24edc8; ba07839452027833db9f04fc07740739e508b314; 2a32e3b0469dcb0a32f6ccbd50b434d97c6ffc98; 27589ba85ca6b0ae5194db953dc6cb473f4505c4; 83fb5eba4180a22fe31566e13ad3267a85841008; 63c37ce3a6336ac0a56c11e9c5959160410c23c2; fa9d06f3ec7fda185bc3f5c4b00e38e6de898ab1; 4f7e1c6ebd2a2bf8df9525a8414e14d55685072b; 5b6351a96cf4ea6204585e3c01fce7055d4234f8; cda62809a8fbf1e3f4f0a12678f241e114516c42; df33e7c63c6cdcb3b864194f7a859419c3861e54; 4cfe7f01a8c56fa426a90d4d924a429e384cf1c8; 8169be48340dba30973ed5e69635003c1ffd9976; 55e957ba45ca214cba6ff9ee5ad3c9882bf71830; 442668d8942872bd106e0672ca3ac14b9b11768f,European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience,,1 - 10
4f870a08f5eb66140cfbccdd777da690b9e58976,Evidence for association between multiple complement pathway genes and AMD.,"In this paper we explore the use of biological knowledge to supplement statistical analysis in identifying genes associated with disease. It has been previously found that the 402H variant in complement factor H (CFH) is associated with risk for developing age related macular degeneration (AMD). By focusing on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement pathway, we were able to use the genotype data from a recently published AMD genome wide association study to identify two additional genes, C7 and MBL2, as potentially associated with subtypes of AMD. Two SNPs situated in introns of C7 and MBL2 could help differentiate between two forms of AMD: wet (more severe form of AMD) and dry (milder form of AMD). We identified a C7 haplotype associated with protection against developing wet AMD among individuals with homozygous CFH risk allele 402H (p-value 0.001 for wet AMD versus dry AMD, odds ratio (OR) 0.16, OR 95% CI 0.05-0.49) as well as among individuals with at least one CFH risk allele (p-value 0.007 for wet AMD versus dry AMD, OR 0.35, OR 95% CI 0.16-0.77). The fact that the statistical scores for the C7 and MBL2 SNPs were significant (low false discovery rate) at the pathway level, but not significant at the genome level suggests that focusing at the pathway level can be beneficial for identifying SNP signals that would be lost at the genome-wide level.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Valentin Dinu"", ids = ""49974905""); list(name = ""Perry L.

b1768bca89559fcb5b0a2ead65600451eee80087,Localized glaucomatous change detection within the proper orthogonal decomposition framework.,"PURPOSE
To detect localized glaucomatous structural changes using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) framework with false-positive control that minimizes confirmatory follow-ups, and to compare the results to topographic change analysis (TCA).


METHODS
We included 167 participants (246 eyes) with â‰¥4 Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT)-II exams from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study; 36 eyes progressed by stereo-photographs or visual fields. All other patient eyes (n = 210) were non-progressing. Specificities were evaluated using 21 normal eyes. Significance of change at each HRT superpixel between each follow-up and its nearest baseline (obtained using POD) was estimated using mixed-effects ANOVA. Locations with significant reduction in retinal height (red pixels) were determined using Bonferroni, Lehmann-Romano k-family-wise error rate (k-FWER), and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) type I error control procedures. Observed positive rate (OPR) in each follow-up was calculated as a ratio of number of red pixels within disk to disk size. Progression by POD was defined as one or more follow-ups with OPR greater than the anticipated false-positive rate. TCA was evaluated using the recently proposed liberal, moderate, and conservative progression criteria.


RESULTS
Sensitivity in progressors, specificity in normals, and specificity in non-progressors, respectively, were POD-Bonferroni = 100%, 0%, and 0%; POD k-FWER = 78%, 86%, and 43%; POD-FDR = 78%, 86%, and 43%; POD k-FWER with retinal height change â‰¥50 Î¼m = 61%, 95%, and 60%; TCA-liberal = 86%, 62%, and 21%; TCA-moderate = 53%, 100%, and 70%; and TCA-conservative = 17%, 100%, and 84%.


CONCLUSIONS
With a stronger control of type I errors, k-FWER in POD framework minimized confirmatory follow-ups while providing diagnostic accuracy comparable to TCA. Thus, POD with k-FWER shows promise to reduce the number of confirmatory follow-ups required for clinical care and studies evaluating new glaucoma treatments.

7a6928d77502b7ce76d7248352bdbf50bbd746dd,Empirical Bayes method for reducing false discovery rates of correlation matrices with block diagonal structure,"BackgroundCorrelation matrices are important in inferring relationships and networks between regulatory or signalling elements in biological systems. With currently available technology sample sizes for experiments are typically small, meaning that these correlations can be difficult to estimate. At a genome-wide scale estimation of correlation matrices can also be computationally demanding.ResultsWe develop an empirical Bayes approach to improve covariance estimates for gene expression, where we assume the covariance matrix takes a block diagonal form. Our method shows lower false discovery rates than existing methods on simulated data. Applied to a real data set from Bacillus subtilis we demonstrate itâ€™s ability to detecting known regulatory units and interactions between them.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method is able to find significant covariances and also to control false discovery rates, even when the sample size is small (n=10). The method can be used to find potential regulatory networks, and it may also be used as a pre-processing step for methods that calculate, for example, partial correlations, so enabling the inference of the causal and hierarchical structure of the networks.",2017,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Clare Pacini"", ids = ""35021523""); list(name = ""James W.

535a83bbc4311c172000fb5e6a763ae04e6e63bf,Pretreatment serum uracil concentration as a predictor of severe and fatal fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity,"Background:We investigated the predictive value of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) phenotype, measured as pretreatment serum uracil and dihydrouracil concentrations, for severe as well as fatal fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity in 550 patients treated previously with fluoropyrimidines during a prospective multicenter study.Methods:Pretreatment serum concentrations of uracil and dihydrouracil were measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. The primary endpoint of this analysis was global (any) severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity, that is, grade â©¾3 toxicity according to the NCI CTC-AE v3.0, occurring during the first cycle of treatment. The predictive value of uracil and the uracil/dihydrouracil ratio for early severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity were compared. Pharmacogenetic variants in DPYD (c.2846A>T, c.1679T>G, c.1129-5923C>G, and c.1601G>A) and TYMS (TYMS 5â€²-UTR VNTR and TYMS 3â€²-UTR 6-bp ins/del) were measured and tested for associations with severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity to compare predictive value with DPD phenotype. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method was used to control for type I errors at level q<0.050 (corresponding to P<0.010).Results:Uracil was superior to the dihydrouracil/uracil ratio as a predictor of severe toxicity. High pretreatment uracil concentrations (>16â€‰ngâ€‰mlâˆ’1) were strongly associated with global severe toxicity (OR 5.3, P=0.009), severe gastrointestinal toxicity (OR 33.7, P<0.0001), toxicity-related hospitalisation (OR 16.9, P<0.0001), as well as fatal treatment-related toxicity (OR 44.8, P=0.001). None of the DPYD variants alone, or TYMS variants alone, were associated with severe toxicity.Conclusions:High pretreatment uracil concentration was strongly predictive of severe, including fatal, fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity, and is a highly promising phenotypic marker to identify patients at risk of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Didier Meulendijks"", ids = ""5000086""); list(name = ""Linda M Henricks"", ids = ""13352864""); list(name = ""Bart A.

Owing to the complexity of glycosylation, the current overall throughput, data quality and accessibility of intact glycopeptide identification lack behind those in routine proteomic analyses. Here, we propose a workflow for the precise high-throughput identification of intact N-glycopeptides at the proteome scale using stepped-energy fragmentation and a dedicated search engine. pGlyco 2.0 conducts comprehensive quality control including false discovery rate evaluation at all three levels of matches to glycans, peptides and glycopeptides, improving the current level of accuracy of intact glycopeptide identification. The N-glycoproteome of samples metabolically labeled with 15N/13C were analyzed quantitatively and utilized to validate the glycopeptide identification, which could be used as a novel benchmark pipeline to compare different search engines. Finally, we report a large-scale glycoproteome dataset consisting of 10,009 distinct site-specific N-glycans on 1988 glycosylation sites from 955 glycoproteins in five mouse tissues.Protein glycosylation is a heterogeneous post-translational modification that generates greater proteomic diversity that is difficult to analyze.

58d0e0eea7b143e0d253fb77ad4978ce58069bfd,48 Different chromatin accessibility in murine male and female inner cell mass,"Previous research has shown that embryos conceived by IVF show a sexual dimorphic phenotype and different metabolite expression into adulthood. Interestingly, female embryos have a higher apoptotic rate and are more vulnerable to environmental stressors. Our prior studies have examined DNA methylation changes in male and female embryos; however, limited knowledge is available with regard to chromatin accessibility in male and female embryos. The objective of this study was to assess if genome-wide chromatin accessibility changes occur in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the male v. female mouse embryo. For this experiment we utilised expanded blastocysts (CF-1 femalesâ€‰Ã—â€‰B6D2F1 males) that were obtained by IVF or flushed out of the uterus (FB, control). We performed IVF using KSOM with amino acids and 5% O2. The ICM were isolated from trophectoderm cells utilising immunosurgery and complement. The chromatin status was assessed using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin status using a sequencing (ATAC seq) protocol modified from Wu et al. (2016 Nature 524, 652-657, DOI: 10.1038/nature18606). Briefly, cells were lysed and nuclei incubated with the Tn5 transposome and tagmentation buffer (Nextera, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). After tagmentation, PCR amplification (15 cycles), mitochondrial depletion, and library purification were performed. The sex of the embryo was determined based on MSY (male sex region on the Y chromosome) and total Y chromosome aligning reads. Samples were then divided into 2 groups, male (nâ€‰=â€‰20) and female (nâ€‰=â€‰25), and sequencing was completed using Illumina HiSEqn 2500 (Illumina Inc.). Sequencing was completed using Illumina HiSEqn 2500. MACS2 (https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/) was used for peak identification from the sequencing results and DESEqn 2 (https://www.r-project.org/) was used for statistical analysis and false discovery rateâ€‰<0.1 was considered significant. GREAT analysis (http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/) was used to identify the top biological processes. Overall, 17,136 regions were identified as more open in males and 19,460 regions were identified as more open in females. Interestingly, of these identified regions, only 28 were considered significant (25 increased and 3 decreased in males). The majority of these regions were located on chromosome Y and most of the regions that were increased in male correlated with gene Gm10352, a gene with an unknown function. While some pathway changes were expected, like the ones involved in sex determination, male gonadal development, and male sexual characteristics, others included histone demethylation, regulation of chromatin silencing, negative regulation of DNA replication, and antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen. Our data are the first to analyse genome-wide chromatin accessibility changes in the ICM of male and female mouse embryos. Importantly, these data indicate that chromatin differences are already present in the ICM of male and female embryos. Further analysis will provide insights into epigenetic and sexual dimorphic changes present in embryos.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Elena Ruggeri"", ids = ""48929722""); list(name = ""Edward J.

fb6d874baf578b0269859c4a86adb564c29dfd58,Parametric Estimation of the Local False Discovery Rate for Identifying Genetic Associations,"Many genome-wide association studies have been conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with particular diseases or other traits. The local false discovery rate (LFDR) estimated using semiparametric models has enjoyed success in simultaneous inference. However, semiparametric LFDR estimators can be biased because they tend to overestimate the proportion of the nonassociated SNPs. We address the problem by adapting a simple parametric mixture model (PMM) and by comparing this model to the semiparametric mixture model (SMM) behind an LFDR estimator that is known to be conservatively biased. Then, we also compare the PMM with a parametric nonmixture model (PNM). In our simulation studies, we thoroughly analyze the performances of the three models under different values of p1, a prior probability that is approximately equal to the proportion of SNPs that are associated with the disease. When p1 > 10%, the PMM generally performs better than the SMM. When p1 <; 0:1%, the SMM outperforms PMM. When p1 lies between 0.1 and 10 percent, both methods have about the same performance. In that setting, the PMM may be preferred since it has the advantage of supplying an estimate of the detectability level of the nonassociated SNPs.",2013,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ye Yang"", ids = ""29123532""); list(name = ""Farnoosh Abbas Aghababazadeh"", ids = ""2002591""); list(name = ""David R.

97005686e61335a8be475916940e9cacee0cf84c,"Longitudinal, Multiparametric MRI Assessment of repetitive mild TBI in rats","Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has long term health effects and may result in the development of neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disorders. Histology shows axonal and dendritic beading, synaptic atrophy, vasodilation and gliosis occuring within hours/days post-mTBI. However, current neuroimaging techniques are unable to detect the early effects of repetitive mTBI. Consequently, mTBI brain scans are normal appearing and inconclusive. Hence, neuroimaging markers capable of detecting subtle microstructural and functional alterations are needed. We present results from longitudinal, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of repetitive mTBI in rats. We employ advanced in-vivo diffusion MRI (dMRI) to probe brain microstructural alterations, perfusion MRI to assess cerebral blood flow (CBF), close to the injury site, and proton MR spectroscopy to assess metabolic alterations in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. High resolution anatomical scans were also acquired. In agreement with clinical observations, anatomical scans of rats were normal appearing even after repeated mTBI. Throughout, significance is regarded as p<0.05 post false discovery rate correction. dMRI revealed significant microstructural remodelling in ipsilateral hippocampus (reduced radial kurtosis), may be due to axonal/dendritic beading, demyelination, synaptic atrophy and edema. Consistent with prior reports of reduced cell/fiber density in mTBI, we find significantly increased mean diffusivity in ipsilateral corpus callosum. We also find significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) and increased total Choline (tCho) following second and third mTBI (vs baseline), also reported in clinical mTBI cohorts. Reduced GSH suggests oxidative stress and increase in tCho indicate cell damage/repair. CBF did not change significantly, however, high variability in CBF following the second and third mTBI suggest increased variability in CBF likely due to tissue hypoxia and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress may affect capillary blood flow by disturbing pericyte capillary contraction. Around 40% of pericytes retract after mTBI causing pericyte depletion and white matter dysfunction as suggested by dMRI findings. Multiparametric MRI detects meaningful mTBI-induced alterations otherwise undetectable with conventional MRI. Similar strategies may provide useful information to aid diagnosis of human mTBI.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Ahmad Raza Khan"", ids = ""145657349""); list(name = ""Brian Benjamin Hansen"", ids = ""66716841""); list(name = ""Nina K Iversen"", ids = ""40592061""); list(name = ""Jonas Lynge Olesen"", ids = ""23152847""); list(name = ""Mariana Angoa-PÃ©rez"", ids = ""1438367217""); list(name = ""Donald M Kuhn"", ids = ""143901193""); list(name = ""Lars JÃ¸rgen Ã\230stergaard"", ids = ""2405999""); list(name = ""Sune NÃ¸rhÃ¸j Jespersen"", ids = ""7867530"")",9d4905dd013cfd88c620c9e4607179e42aa4847e,1bc761913473ec71ab985a52c82f697fd5e5e532; 1db8f1c67c3dc22ac2b1aa7998973224bb3ab28c; 9c396a48384bbab6c4954111aa3ff5ff8a0eb821; ad5847f69b443f7e537abe857ad2cb9a4f29aa45; 4d65543d48df1a55558be756fd591b01d8be1569; 77a6f6b0541029413eaa9e12cea5b305b9e6e80e; 0970fcd61bcd004f415257867c9986a4f5b9a5b4; 88cba3cb0f937d4b825bf11a438280417d66e718; 1b3d0bd14ac38b5ae655ed39872768520529951d; ab1ee691f54d0c9240d8faa8e2f80f85a8b671fd; bfc6b9c67a449e85770a3a124a1dbe8bc0282da4; a68e759cce557797f22f1c271632a0a2e0f4ed63; 42745750d062d02d828220343812dccd9b722c9f; 19ac09106922689bd1f986482bcfa3ac6ed60726; b2dd3c0b4759e54e46d45b82a85a6c631746634a; bfbc32e3d7817135fb084fbf76f6d37525c10314; 6317e773af569f67525c710f911e7804d1afe8d8; 8a398c9fc7c550e2ade10cde4ed593796743af2b; 6f17f1107f0be0cb050c65e4ce2232d92867d480; e6cd895459c6944a04b22b0f2f3d25df70143648; c212a92e133ccb61ac50b779c9b0bc330dd6e3cf; 5e8c2693f0743169f95917664ba2383d2af658d3; ad5c74614a64b1ace8133f7209fb7d8497a654c7; 09b6cf20644255c32b7f444ef45e559118e2e534; 3586dc60b632341da05dccf4a951bd6c0a149c09; 664d81ed404c7800310b3b41d9debee5d014f931; 385fd7a91ef4484087f7c9cf90cb40c15f43452f; e9a49a6df29e54c53da2d4e15e348e3a51ba29fe; 9bbcdbc7bf33ca12f9cc7369a6c6791e06e145f3; 10c90952bf1e836528a6b6686e0dab9ee5671f6d; ed1a21e161ca5050fab0da2022fd951bb11ecfeb; 07ff64f09b318b7ed67c41aff952cbb6ba94a721; f8aa6a44bc614b7abd2e5fea54441a43ff7814c3; d87f99cc10c479a1d30a5caab83669a10063709b; c04502747d96be7e2b3681fe650ae150ebf57668; e1c18fed79ad769ce7deeba9f4af2eb337bfc436; 0305c2c99753b97985c9f1abd0332001ea87667b; 24d2ec2c2470dad30a27544e87bca58b32ed6451; 3e8d04dea3fc5d343e96b2e902f3381049f48301; 5df576b1d0d490d67dd2dcc20c5224acb24c0bf4; b3dd1f4717c0fc20fe47f44a73f075f604cfd210; 8dd3831a7307d2210057aa13b2cc205ef9674d11; b210e7f8db25cbf286d700a105a566860d3660e4; f6b9348a71b84b4919e9ec1101d9e189e05d76f2; 84b78aea9cbd5117d70ebaf188ac20db3959cf07; 279d0265bd9b5dddc248b850e429cbe5cef56f67; e3f7474e8ea172e64d3a712f26f03f36c82a88a8; fc2941e15dc0d0de32cb650078e18899399ee566; c211299261252758866addda6169da45c931c2f0; 05af1793a8e10b44d7b9d3c6108b79a0a3883be8; 62f5553e3db964055b36ece9f3ed319d7e038191; 25285ee5048bcdc0a0fa54691986669173531537; 7c41307e68d2e3549fa74e060eb0e26887f4c734; 9af9d5874f81797cb3ca272c83c4edd9d1de1036; a10227b63813333fee122c9589c8af320c60822e; b842addfbf6e3a20eef355fe5b6152c0aeecefc8; ca36eda23620fe92df60e63ab008d7ebe86f9c01; 4ecf6b23e12a0d4fc2bf30898fdb833c54beea5e; 4522671de8aa5e76ec187651bf406a810391d44b; 578aba1708245913cfd5e04c5dcb8b6643fab51a; 00cc40fe2cb050bc073601165246a90566536a0e; 653fbe87d7b8b810722e7e25a9c193380203e817; 7e78b63a0575217c73d86e0132c9067b4480d2e0; d2533196e82fbbd655d4441a96e585b4a3fa66cc; ff3c394bcca35c12a42ae594fcab1845497564eb,bioRxiv,,
29044af328ea8e03e2982d2f73fcab898b1fdaff,"Wavelet analysis for non-stationary, nonlinear time series","Abstract. Methods for detecting and quantifying nonlinearities in nonstationary time series are introduced and developed. In particular, higher-order wavelet analysis was applied to an ideal time series and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) time series. Multiple-testing problems inherent in wavelet analysis were addressed by controlling the false discovery rate. A new local autobicoherence spectrum facilitated the detection of local nonlinearities and the quantification of cycle geometry. The local autobicoherence spectrum of the QBO time series showed that the QBO time series contained a mode with a period of 28Â months that was phase coupled to a harmonic with a period of 14Â months. An additional nonlinearly interacting triad was found among modes with periods of 10, 16 and 26Â months. Local biphase spectra determined that the nonlinear interactions were not quadratic and that the effect of the nonlinearities was to produce non-smoothly varying oscillations. The oscillations were found to be skewed so that negative QBO regimes were preferred, and also asymmetric in the sense that phase transitions between the easterly and westerly phases occurred more rapidly than those from westerly to easterly regimes.",2015,Physics,"list(name = ""Justin Schulte"", ids = ""40100817"")",ad464b3987e42e3ae6ca4ce82474756c738323d6; def2d65e5e302aaadcfcc869a5affb6be29cbea8; 5d6802ae55846da292541dc6baee47602611f57b; 9b460fa80dbc94f4f9c8b6092cc89fdcc4316e53; c19501dc5d4885b8a28eb32a0b0453e767844165; 21f1bbda21c668545b197c1163abd4245a312f09; 48c5c34f29b68f925d156b564ca0b9c9946b73d2,8ec1baa966464aa7aa1981b4743c1acbeb8729b4; 69d292616d939256a4ece5b16bd5bba427110c49; eb4e15e27b24cf00932620b6d6db2507755fabf9; ffd7586bb3bcfdc4f3cc490567a7f1e39ae28cb4; 0d44f7e0fd3c750778bfdf4eebc89ecb90c16cc0; 5c8ddec55a9267154fa2c2b8d5efdcef8c0d0ff3; 2049e7176afb9b7b064afa4443176e4805a56133; da6fa080a1f810d618e520956e838fe51c063aff; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 882f7c3abdff8762c23e24ed1a5658186a4c37e1; f017abb05711b08c558010a04679e6f78ce5e5b1; 3ca98b5214edf9edcaa3b5a9d082e723089b9028; 00bc9f38a03e99c7b045bd124a763dfe0f744ad5; 75b24e9982a7b5c762a666571e5eed4fce5bd430; 7e91bb549588f85122ca6dae30f16f2097ef1ded; 4da4d92c3fd4cb70b9a137e8e3663286e23d5bc6; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 4c794724efba21333fa10b727609187e3cfee398; 76405e527521b9b7e1f31996916d379991f37883; 24f3e29d9feab95e78f3f47364c4edbae34adfd2; 08773ecdcb5c0f63ebc649281d378b4df03ce64c; 85d6b5741aabb3dfa00bebdc105cd8d903b39117; 8af3c044b4447eafba4bd79b6ca4c2ff91b5836a; f447acefe38f48e7c61f0c4d0ebef66dd43cbc14; e1d76532a9537854c5948c795c1663bf6a66ee7b; 3372ef082930270720947476287d9d3c14f85c55; 20f604bb7997554dc2144b04a46b7c387bb8ce6c; 3c04267735ff5ec1e42d0157f73dae18d07bb43c; a0f700449d02f7d04d1d175e9f9496725b7a03f0; a00967907e43ac97d3fb44e326f2f4c31e103fe1; 9240256f7cd533efaa6a611b7d4e15edb290f886; ff9dd4908d5b3ce6037e707f6b3f7af2ea021468; 92e04c5097ceebc078c671a9179d6b972ce75520; a1ae139302dd893e48e9ea54409df183a06a67f8,Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics,23,257-267
514de7fd03e14cf5b557b859fddaab2277e45850,Comparison of Methods for Estimating the Number of True Null Hypotheses in Multiplicity Testing,"Abstract When a large number of statistical tests is performed, the chance of false positive findings could increase considerably. The traditional approach is to control the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis, the familywise error rate (FWE). To improve the power of detecting treatment differences, an alternative approach is to control the expected proportion of errors among the rejected hypotheses, the false discovery rate (FDR). When some of the hypotheses are not true, the error rate from either the FWE- or the FDR-controlling procedure is usually lower than the designed level. This paper compares five methods used to estimate the number of true null hypotheses over a large number of hypotheses. The estimated number of true null hypotheses is then used to improve the power of FWE- or FDR-controlling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. The lowest slope method, developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) on the adaptive control of the FDR in multiple testing with independent statistics, and the mean of differences method appear to perform the best. These two methods control the FWE properly when the number of nontrue null hypotheses is small. A data set from a toxicogenomic microarray experiment is used for illustration.",2003,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Huey-miin Hsueh"", ids = ""38211103""); list(name = ""James J.

b264a304b3a1991a2de365e1a76cc8810c79d28e,The immune response to sub-clinical mastitis is impaired in HIV-infected women,"BackgroundSubclinical mastitis (SCM) is relatively common in lactating women and may be associated with HIV shedding in breast milk. The potential association between HIV infection and breast milk immunologic factors and immune response to SCM needs to be addressed.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, SCM (Na/K ratioâ€‰>â€‰1) was tested in 165 mature breast milk samples collected from 40 HIV-infected women who didnâ€™t transmit HIV to their child by breastfeeding and 43 HIV-uninfected women enrolled in an interventional cohort in South-Africa (Vertical Transmission Study). The level of 33 immune markers related to Th1/Th2 related response, inflammation and bacterial exposure were compared in ART-naive HIV-infected versus HIV-uninfected women. The associations between HIV infection and SCM on the concentration of immune factors were tested separately by Wilcoxon rank-sum test and corrected for false discovery rate. To control for potential confounder effects and take into account the clustering of breast milk samples from a single woman, multivariate mixed linear models adjusted on child age at the time of sampling were performed for each immune factor.ResultsSubclinical mastitis was detected in 15 (37.5%) HIV-infected women and 10 (23.3%) HIV-uninfected women. In the absence of SCM, the breast milk levels of IP-10 and MIG were higher and IL1-RA lower in HIV-infected women than in HIV-uninfected women (respectively pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, pâ€‰=â€‰0.045). In HIV-uninfected women, SCM was characterized by a robust immune response with higher concentrations of a broad panel of Th1 and inflammatory related immune markers than in samples without SCM. By contrast, in HIV-infected women a limited number of immune markers were increased and lower increases were observed in samples with SCM than without SCM.ConclusionHIV infection in ART-naÃ¯ve women was associated with elevated breast milk levels of IP-10 and MIG, which areTh1-related cytokines induced by IFN-Î³. During SCM, a lower and narrower immune response was observed in HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected women, suggesting that HIV infection affects the capacity of the mammary gland to respond to SCM.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Roxane Schaub"", ids = ""50336473""); list(name = ""StÃ©phanie Badiou"", ids = ""3744028""); list(name = ""Johannes Viljoen"", ids = ""34712272""); list(name = ""Pierre Dujols"", ids = ""3233670""); list(name = ""Karine BollorÃ©"", ids = ""3551922""); list(name = ""Philippe Van de Perre"", ids = ""6772427""); list(name = ""Marie-Louise Newell"", ids = ""143645586""); list(name = ""Ruth Margaret Bland"", ids = ""3697104""); list(name = ""Nicolas Nagot"", ids = ""4628539""); list(name = ""Edouard Tuaillon"", ids = ""3694367"")",,a520a037be69b3f739c0d76b95214d8f181f9bb8; 6bc345aaa795dff5c9eaf3bcdfdc7c36fe14ea6e; 2d8394b3f5895fce6cf8ffb916d7e16884cc1318; 89aaea05c3f9c3a1e47b8d5694e5c48764def347; a4e120578c047c81fd58512663ae002e30d998d1; 98e9db0c8f6d5094b817c9edd03bc6a4c9a0fea7; 4a989f021d08b3d244ff0e7b2487a1a26fc49914; 3a9c4fbfb65df4f240057aa728af418e8fb9afed; cf5fa483350740b847fbea6ff31043968aace496; 58f3d0451e761cc636d0aefafa0949da708143e5; 1f066e5c5c07e5534211cd59b2d8883b40d7b04b; 234311e65f5127a96730ec0f35d372fc702e0226; f35615ff46b5d30811a3bfc880937eb77b5fb80f; a143c1bb9234bde58f4dfc99339c22591d19c2e1; 3e7bdc1fd33cbb78d7e900f2b457fccc962e4a5b; 0e1c99dcfc7e0425dff88c00028312df1a3bc3ec; 093c29c92e914563e146c3c38a6a8c680e2f7c0d; 82098a2411643d349c0531e57f95f9c94e8e345f; 596996431828e6e412a04084f10b53617cc4fbeb; fda15b8212516ad8f761e89119a166f18e5c7301; 752e9c760dff9920434ed3ec5f9dff1f6213250a; 742e34c6c109858beb3dafa53119b05d4c5fb1ec; 466421d685a39b7fa4e41af4cbf26f00534e275c; 67e856ef4691202fadd93475f8bd003c69982bb3; 276bda720495622376a0b6bb8f4509d68c5b10ae; 7550e590249f014ab4860a0eb1b7c1e15ee130d5; e64550d25e4091f2ecd2de26d28542d4417b825a; b7a5537abfcd136db375cd9b0f2195ae369f2d64; 8b17d8302d73c217125d2b985a21fd7496806d09; 07c195c5d435fe43ca32ea8346e5cfcd1f5864e9; 385654d8147815cf7d97fda5af10727c06eb35ef; 9a10e42ffc2fdabeac507750343a42e55fe43278; 38ffedee2195afe9734f3333979774925e403dfa; 529d2cf2ccb5c4320a7823af18edebd571107358; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b85a88e8a2a30475b282c1aec190afb2149bccb3; cee19b2316da2e4787d491ebe2ef550cbd8270cc; 42b845850d6613186456b6c17ff54fdb2cf3991f; 4a4c3f31b7472804d27743cdf9b39c308996336e; afe29e2e4241c1fc805f4a272f18c339f502f41a; d6057321bd256522ef5e27568f6c929d15e02fc4; fc05cb96fe92d59c7d5bd3618aff67979089fbba; 7f8035fc4337428568e6b46edf812117c8859d83; 36591ee4e29993105b3ac00dda0c42ea87b8a136; e11a2c5265f34fc2758872e2f3bf074a0ab38dc8; 3e1eb0773810b81af4708d3db495ddaa9abee28b; 494ed53e9e4d8fe93a4992eb07c78148d51e8e76; 2152a0ab4394ae2810023d80de9378b32de3d028; 31879a293e58f9be0072018d2441c8339db51be5; c2477e87e9aee8a45e74e4e9789a97b1f7d6fa90; e71adf4f128268aa7395d3aaf50a47b2c3c66257; b46bd27728ecfbd99205fb4deab34b1c1a4d9cb5; 16203773746e315d793c88f92388b632dc108d9d; e16d081ac26f5b7cca8b21228fa63dc4ac390b24; 3b091c0119f183384731f83e05fd9e05cb98db68; b1bdd0532223b9d9fea18c9f7511085652384fdb,Journal of Translational Medicine,16,

We wished to examine the association of GPS with BCR and CR in higher-risk disease. Methods: We performed exploratory analyses of data from a prior development study of radical prostatectomies from 441 men with AUA low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease, using a cohort sampling design (Klein et al. Eur Urol 2015). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were employed with the cohort sampling weights. Since these data were used in the selection of genes and coefficients for GPS, hazard ratios (HR) and other estimates based on GPS were corrected for regression to the mean (RM), and Storeyâ€™s method was applied to hypothesis tests for GPS to control the false discovery rate (FDR).

3d6d8766037f49b327b42009a0bb514f8a1fb9af,Decline of fiber tract integrity over the adult age range: a diffusion spectrum imaging study.,"PURPOSE
We applied a novel diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) acquisition to determine associations between aging and subcortical fiber tract integrity.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We studied 35 cognitively healthy subjects (17 women), spanning the adult age range between 23 and 77 years, using anatomical MRI and a novel DSI acquisition scheme at 3 Tesla. The study was approved by the local institutional review board. DSI data were analyzed using tractography and complementary voxel-based analysis of generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) maps. We determined the effects of age on generalized fractional anisotropy in selected fiber tracts as well as in a whole brain voxel-based analysis. For comparison, we studied the effects of age on regional gray and white matter volumes.


RESULTS
We found a significant reduction in anterior corpus callosum fiber tract integrity with age (P < 0.001), as well as significant GFA reduction throughout the subcortical white matter (P < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected). GFA decline was accompanied by significant gray matter atrophy in frontal and temporal association cortex (P < 0.05, FDR corrected).


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that normal aging leads to a regionally specific decline in fiber tract integrity. DSI may become a useful biomarker in healthy and pathological aging.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefan J.

The first is use of Empirical Bayes (EB) methods to handle the large number of potentially-sparse effects, and estimate false discovery rates and related quantities. The second is use of factor analysis methods to deal with sources of unwanted variation such as batch effects and unmeasured confounders. We describe a simple modular fitting procedure that combines key ideas from both these lines of research. This yields new, powerful EB methods for analyzing genomics experiments that account for both sparse effects and unwanted variation. In realistic simulations, these new methods provide significant gains in power and calibration over competing methods. In real data analysis, we find that different methods, while often conceptually similar, can vary widely in their assessments of statistical significance.

When $r>1$ the hypothesis $H^{r/n}_0$ is composite. Validity versus the case with $r-1$ alternative hypotheses holding can lead to very conservative tests. We develop a filtering approach for $H^{r/n}_0$ based on the $M$ p-values for $H^{(r-1)/n}_0$. This filtering approach has greater power than straightforward PC testing.

Several different cell types contribute to the pathogenesis of ACM, including, as recently described, cardiac stromal cells (CStCs). In the present study, we aim to identify ACM-specific expression profiles of human CStCs derived from endomyocardial biopsies of ACM patients and healthy individuals employing TaqMan Low Density Arrays for miRNA expression profiling, and high throughput sequencing for gene expression quantification.ResultsWe identified 3 miRNAs and 272 genes as significantly differentially expressed at a 5% false discovery rate. Both the differentially expressed genes as well as the target genes of the ACM-specific miRNAs were found to be enriched in cell adhesion-related biological processes.

The aim of this study was to identify the differentially regulated genes that correlate with the development of prion diseases for a better understanding of their pathological mechanisms. We employed Affymetrix Mouse Expression Arrays 430A containing >22,000 transcripts and compared the global gene expression profiles from brains of mice who were intracerebrally inoculated with scrapie strains ME7 and RML with those from brains of uninfected and mock-infected mice. The microarray data were analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays, revealing 121 genes whose expression increased at least twofold in both ME7- and RML-infected mouse brains, with an estimated false discovery rate of < or =5%. These genes encode proteins involved in proteolysis, protease inhibition, cell growth and maintenance, the immune response, signal transduction, cell adhesion, and molecular metabolism. The time course of expression generally showed up-regulation of these genes from 120 days postinoculation (dpi) for ME7-inoculated mouse brains and from 90 dpi for RML-inoculated mouse brains. The onset of elevated expression correlated temporally with the onset of PrP(Sc) accumulation and the activation of glia, which may have contributed to neuronal cell death. Among the differentially regulated genes reported in the present study, the emergence of genes for several cathepsins and S100 calcium binding proteins was conspicuous. These and other genes reported here may represent novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for prion disease.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Xiang"", ids = ""47715594""); list(name = ""Otto Windl"", ids = ""50198443""); list(name = ""Gerda WÃ¼nsch"", ids = ""15352640""); list(name = ""Martin Dugas"", ids = ""152198280""); list(name = ""Alexander Kohlmann"", ids = ""2473934""); list(name = ""Nicola Dierkes"", ids = ""7008718""); list(name = ""Ingo M.

126a1c5f9e50199494fbb6dcbfcf3aa3104f97f4,Integrating genome-wide association study summaries and element-gene interaction datasets identified multiple associations between elements and complex diseases.,"Chemical elements are closely related to human health. Extensive genomic profile data of complex diseases offer us a good opportunity to systemically investigate the relationships between elements and complex diseases/traits. In this study, we applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach to detect the associations between elements and complex diseases/traits though integrating element-gene interaction datasets and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of complex diseases/traits. To illustrate the performance of GSEA, the element-gene interaction datasets of 24 elements were extracted from the comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD). GWAS summary datasets of 24 complex diseases or traits were downloaded from the dbGaP or GEFOS websites. We observed significant associations between 7 elements and 13 complex diseases or traits (all false discovery rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.05), including reported relationships such as aluminum vs. Alzheimer's disease (FDRÂ =Â 0.042), calcium vs. bone mineral density (FDRÂ =Â 0.031), magnesium vs. systemic lupus erythematosus (FDRÂ =Â 0.012) as well as novel associations, such as nickel vs. hypertriglyceridemia (FDRÂ =Â 0.002) and bipolar disorder (FDRÂ =Â 0.027). Our study results are consistent with previous biological studies, supporting the good performance of GSEA.

1b60d69d663f5b71db4a685b8722896ba85aae63,Bone Marrow Cells from Patients with Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome Abnormally Express Ribosomal Protein and Ribosomal Biogenesis-Related Genes.,"Background and rational: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by varying degrees of cytopenia and high propensity for myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia. SBDS , the gene associated with SDS, has recently been identified and is postulated to play a role in ribosomal biogenesis and RNA processing, but its functions are still unknown. Defects in ribosomal biogenesis can be characterized by abnormal synthesis of rRNA synthesis or ribosomal proteins or both. Determining the mRNA expression pattern of the various RP genes in SBDS deficient cells will help deciphering the role of SBDS in ribosomal biogenesis. Objectives: To determine whether the primary SDS marrow cells which carry homozygous SBDS mutations abnormally express genes which code for ribosomal proteins (RP) or for proteins that are involved in its transcription. Methods: Total RNA from marrow cells from 9 SDS patients who had hypocellular marrow with normal differential and no malignant transformation and 7 healthy age-matched donors of bone marrows for transplantation was extracted. RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HG_U133_Plus2.0 GeneChip. Data were pre-processed using robust multichip analysis (RMA) and differentially expressed genes were identified with permutation-based methods. False discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values were used to rank genes and cluster analysis grouped genes and samples. T-statistic values were used to screen for differentially expressed RP-related genes. Real-time PCR was performed to confirm differential expression of genes found by oligonucleotide microarray. Results: Of the 38,500 genes on the HG_133_Plus2.0 we analyzed 375 known ribosomal protein and RNA processing-related genes. Interestingly, there were differences in the expression pattern of the RP genes, suggesting differential regulation of these genes in Sbds-deficient cells. Interestingly, despite uniform decrease in RP gene expression in reduced cell growth conditions, only 27 of the 85 RP genes were downregulated. Downregulation of representative 2 genes was confirmed by real-time PCR. Further, one of the RP genes, RPL27L was upregulated. This gene, which is a target of p53, has a non-ribosomal function and lead to accelerated apoptosis. It is noteworthy that several genes involved in mRNA transcription such as GABPA and YY1 were downregulated without dysregulation of genes involved in mRNA degradation, suggesting that the downregulation of the RP gene expression is at the transcription level. In addition to dysregulation of the RP mRNA we also found dysregulation of genes involved in rRNA transcription (e.g. MKI67IP ) and pre rRNA processing (e.g. FBL ). Conclusions: SBDS -deficiency results in dysregulation of selective group of RP genes as well as genes related to rRNA processing and rRNA transcription. Future studies should focus on the mechanism of the abnormal expression as well as its biological consequences.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Piya Rujkijyanont"", ids = ""47614764""); list(name = ""Joseph Beyene"", ids = ""47825064""); list(name = ""Yigal Dror"", ids = ""31566048"")",1d0ece88dfc82264d7b66968b9633ce8a8cc78d2,,Blood,110,3303-3303
3c37ad3f44b094b920707e8bb05bd53be3b39d06,A Breast Cancer Risk Haplotype in the Caspase-8 Gene Neil,"Recent large-scale studies have been successful in identifying common, low-penetrance variants associated with common cancers. One such variant in the caspase-8 (CASP8) gene, D302H (rs1045485), has been confirmed to be associated with breast cancer risk, although the functional effect of this polymorphism (if any) is not yet clear. In order to further map the CASP8 gene with respect to breast cancer susceptibility, we performed extensive haplotype analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) chosen to tag all common variations in the gene (tSNP). We used a staged study design based on 3,200 breast cancer and 3,324 control subjects from the United Kingdom, Utah, and Germany. Using a haplotypemining algorithm in the UK cohort, we identified a four-SNP haplotype that was significantly associated with breast cancer and that was superior to any other single or multi-locus combination (P = 8.0 10 ), with a per allele odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of 1.30 (1.12â€“1.49). The result remained significant after adjustment for the multiple testing inherent in mining techniques ( false discovery rate, q = 0.044). As expected, this haplotype includes the D302H locus. Multicenter analyses on a subset of the tSNPs yielded consistent results. This risk haplotype is likely to carry one or more underlying breast cancer susceptibility alleles, making it an excellent candidate for resequencing in homozygous individuals. An understanding of the mode of action of these alleles will aid risk assessment and may lead to the identification of novel treatment targets in breast cancer.

42438946462bc7b98f891e966e810708f7f5a791,Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of DNA methylation and childhood asthma.,"BACKGROUND
Epigenetic mechanisms, including methylation, can contribute to childhood asthma. Identifying DNA methylation profiles in asthmatic patients can inform disease pathogenesis.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to identify differential DNA methylation in newborns and children related to childhood asthma.


METHODS
Within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics consortium, we performed epigenome-wide meta-analyses of school-age asthma in relation to CpG methylation (Illumina450K) in blood measured either in newborns, in prospective analyses, or cross-sectionally in school-aged children. We also identified differentially methylated regions.


RESULTS
In newborns (8 cohorts, 668 cases), 9 CpGs (and 35 regions) were differentially methylated (epigenome-wide significance, false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05) in relation to asthma development. In a cross-sectional meta-analysis of asthma and methylation in children (9 cohorts, 631 cases), we identified 179 CpGs (false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05) and 36 differentially methylated regions. In replication studies of methylation in other tissues, most of the 179 CpGs discovered in blood replicated, despite smaller sample sizes, in studies of nasal respiratory epithelium or eosinophils. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment for asthma-relevant immune processes and overlap in pathways enriched both in newborns and children. Gene expression correlated with methylation at most loci. Functional annotation supports a regulatory effect on gene expression at many asthma-associated CpGs. Several implicated genes are targets for approved or experimental drugs, including IL5RA and KCNH2.


CONCLUSION
Novel loci differentially methylated in newborns represent potential biomarkers of risk of asthma by school age. Cross-sectional associations in children can reflect both risk for and effects of disease. Asthma-related differential methylation in blood in children was substantially replicated in eosinophils and respiratory epithelium.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah E.

16e228ee7bf99021086c7ad0c3f89ab61d7b1476,Association of Complement Factor D and H Polymorphisms with Recurrent Pregnancy Loss,"Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as two or more consecutive pregnancy losses prior to 20 weeks of gestation, and the incidence of RPL is estimated at 1% of all pregnancies. While the etiologies of RPL are diverse, immune function is considered to be an important cause of RPL. In particular, the complement system is essential for stable development of the placenta and fetus. Moreover, complement factor D (CFD) and complement factor H (CFH) are important regulators of the complement system and are associated with diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, we investigated whether polymorphisms of CFD and CFH are associated with RPL in 412 women with RPL and 384 control women. Genotyping of three polymorphisms (CFD rs2230216, CFH rs1065489, and CFH rs1061170) was performed by TaqMan probe real-time PCR and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Association of three polymorphisms with RPL was evaluated by statistical analysis. The GT/TC genotype combination of CFH rs1065489 G>T/CFH rs1061170 T>C was associated with a decreased risk of RPL occurrence compared with reference genotypes (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.439; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.238-0.810; p = 0.008), and this association remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR) correction (p = 0.040). In addition, the CFH rs1065489G>T polymorphism is associated with homocysteine and prolactin level and CFH rs1061170 TC genotype is related to uric acid and triglycerides level in RPL patients. Therefore, those factors could be possible clinical risk factors in RPL patients.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hee Young Cho"", ids = ""2016649""); list(name = ""Han Sung Park"", ids = ""32459847""); list(name = ""Eun Ju Ko"", ids = ""144706724""); list(name = ""Chang Soo Ryu"", ids = ""14425504""); list(name = ""Jung Oh Kim"", ids = ""21510805""); list(name = ""Young Ran Kim"", ids = ""66821398""); list(name = ""Eun Hee Ahn"", ids = ""16197272""); list(name = ""Woo Soon Lee"", ids = ""22606252""); list(name = ""Nam Keun Kim"", ids = ""145858847"")",,,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,21,
45d336814edc569a0085d201825b388ecd72ec02,A two-stage empirical Bayes method for identifying differentially expressed genes,"Due to the high dimensionality of microarray gene expression data and complicated correlations in gene expression levels, statistical methods for analyzing these data often are computationally intensive, requiring special expertise for their implementation. Biologists without such expertise will benefit from a computationally efficient and easy-to-implement analytic method. In this article, we develop such a method: a two-stage empirical Bayes method for identifying differentially expressed genes. We use a special technique to reduce the dimension of the parameter space in the preliminary stage, and construct a Bayesian model in the second stage. The computation of our method is efficient and requires little calibration for real microarray gene expression data.

ee8cf980bfc50fc0be7b02d019e164582ee0a677,Comparison of smoking-induced gene expression on Affymetrix Exon and 3'-based expression arrays.,"Cigarette smoke is the major cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the United States. We have previously defined the impact of tobacco smoke on intrathoracic airway gene expression among healthy nonsmokers and smokers using standard 3'-based expression U133A arrays [12]. In this report, we compared the performance of the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST array with the HG-U133A array for detecting smoking-related gene expression changes in large airway epithelium obtained at bronchoscopy. RNA obtained from the same bronchial airway epithelial cell samples of four current smokers and three never smokers was hybridized to both arrays. Out of 22,215 probe sets on HG-U133A, 14,741 RefSeq transcripts were mapped to 17,800 core transcripts on the Exon array and the 2 platforms were compared for this overlapping transcript set. While the reproducibility of both platforms was high, the Exon array had a slightly stronger correlation for technical replicates. A majority of the genes with the largest smoking-related fold changes were tightly correlated between platforms, but there were a number of smoking-related changes in gene expression that were detected only on the Exon arrays. Furthermore, while the HG-U133A study did not have enough power to detect any differentially expressed genes between the 4 current vs. 3 never smokers at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05, seventy differential expressed genes were detected at FDR < 0.05 in the same set of samples using the Exon platform. These findings suggest that the all-Exon array is a more robust platform for measuring airway epithelial gene expression and can serve as an effective tool for exploring host response to and damage from cigarette smoke.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiaoling Zhang"", ids = ""1724720""); list(name = ""Gang Liu"", ids = ""145634943""); list(name = ""Marc E.

97e3c47c53013db953330fc2ee9cc24e9ea20faf,Expression signature distinguishing two tumour transcriptome classes associated with progression-free survival among rare histological types of epithelial ovarian cancer,"Background:The mechanisms of recurrence have been under-studied in rare histologies of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, and low-grade serous). We hypothesised the existence of an expression signature predictive of outcome in the rarer histologies.Methods:In split discovery and validation analysis of 131 Mayo Clinic EOC cases, we used clustering to determine clinically relevant transcriptome classes using microarray gene expression measurements. The signature was validated in 967 EOC tumours (91 rare histological subtypes) with recurrence information.Results:We found two validated transcriptome classes associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in the Mayo Clinic EOC cases (P=8.24 Ã— 10âˆ’3). This signature was further validated in the public expression data sets involving the rare EOC histologies, where these two classes were also predictive of PFS (P=1.43 Ã— 10âˆ’3). In contrast, the signatures were not predictive of PFS in the high-grade serous EOC cases. Moreover, genes upregulated in Class-1 (with better outcome) were showed enrichment in steroid hormone biosynthesis (false discovery rate, FDR=0.005%) and WNT signalling pathway (FDR=1.46%); genes upregulated in Class-2 were enriched in cell cycle (FDR=0.86%) and toll-like receptor pathways (FDR=2.37%).Conclusions:These findings provide important biological insights into the rarer EOC histologies that may aid in the development of targeted treatment options for the rarer histologies.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chen Wang"", ids = ""48585994""); list(name = ""Boris Winterhoff"", ids = ""6780125""); list(name = ""Kimberly R.

f28206bd6e70e3ffdcdc3d73120939abecd50a03,STATISTICAL ESTIMATION AND TESTING VIA THE ORDERED l 1 NORM By MaÅ‚gorzata,"We introduce a novel method for sparse regression and variable selection, which is inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. Imagine we have observations from the linear model y = XÎ²+ z, then we suggest estimating the regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called the ordered lasso, which is the solution to minimize b 1 2â€–y âˆ’Xbâ€– 2 `2 + Î»1|b|(1) + Î»2|b|(2) + . . .+ Î»p|b|(p); here, Î»1 â‰¥ Î»2 â‰¥ . . . â‰¥ Î»p and |b|(1) â‰¥ |b|(2) â‰¥ . . . â‰¥ |b|(p) is the order statistic of the magnitudes of b. In short, the regularizer is an ordered `1 norm which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rankâ€”the closer to the topâ€”the larger the penalty. This is similar to the famous Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BHq) [9], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a family to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. The ordered lasso is a convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the solution. We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking Î»i = F âˆ’1(1âˆ’ qi) (F is the cumulative distribution function of the errors), qi = iq/(2p), controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. This holds under the assumption that the errors are i.i.d. symmetric and continuous random variables. When the design matrix is nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the power which can be obtained with model selection methods based on `1-like penalties. However, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated, we demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters Î»i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number of nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure exhibits increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally. The paper illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule through comprehensive simulation studies.",2013,,"list(name = ""Bogdan"", ids = ""122508718""); list(name = ""Ewout van den Berg"", ids = ""3258079""); list(name = ""Weijie J.

b7ef2ca5483106278039177637f3cd139b1ebc0a,Quantitative imaging biomarkers for risk stratification of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab,"Background
Anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab is the most widely used treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma, but therapeutic response varies substantially and effective biomarkers for patient selection are not available. To this end, we determine whether novel quantitative radiomic strategies on the basis of MRI have the potential to noninvasively stratify survival and progression in this patient population.


Methods
In an initial cohort of 126 patients, we identified a distinct set of features representative of the radiographic phenotype on baseline (pretreatment) MRI. These selected features were evaluated on a second cohort of 165 patients from the multicenter BRAIN trial with prospectively acquired clinical and imaging data. Features were evaluated in terms of prognostic value for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and progression within 3, 6, and 9 months using baseline imaging and first follow-up imaging at 6 weeks posttreatment initiation.


Results
Multivariable analysis of features derived at baseline imaging resulted in significant stratification of OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.5; log-rank P = 0.001) and PFS (HR = 4.5; log-rank P = 2.1 Ã— 10-5) in validation data. These stratifications were stronger compared with clinical or volumetric covariates (permutation test false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). Univariable analysis of a prognostic textural heterogeneity feature (information correlation) derived from postcontrast T1-weighted imaging revealed significantly higher scores for patients who progressed within 3 months (Wilcoxon test P = 8.8 Ã— 10-8). Generally, features derived from postcontrast T1-weighted imaging yielded higher prognostic power compared with precontrast enhancing T2-weighted imaging.


Conclusion
Radiomics provides prognostic value for survival and progression in patients with recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab treatment.

4184072a79f910ffae834fa07e4f1d7039d08d06,Proteomic analysis of the insoluble subproteome of Clostridium difficile strain 630.,"Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive spore-forming anaerobe, causes infections in humans ranging from mild diarrhoeal to potentially life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. The availability of genomic information for a range of C. difficile strains affords researchers the opportunity to better understand not only the evolution of these organisms but also their basic physiology and biochemistry. We used proteomics to characterize the insoluble subproteome of C. difficile strain 630. Gel-based LC-MS analysis led to the identification of 2298 peptides; provalt analysis with a false discovery rate set at 1% concatenated this list to 560 unique peptides, resulting in 107 proteins being positively identified. These were functionally classified and physiochemically characterized and pathway reconstruction identified a variety of central anaerobic metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, mixed acid fermentation and short-chain fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, the metabolism of a variety of amino acids was apparent, including the reductive branch of the leucine fermentation pathway, from which we identified seven of the eight enzymes. Increasing proteomics data sets should - in conjunction with other 'omic' technologies - allow the construction of models for 'normal' metabolism in C. difficile 630. This would be a significant initial step towards a full systems understanding of this clinically important microorganism.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shailesh Jain"", ids = ""49837588""); list(name = ""Robert Leslie James Graham"", ids = ""152987180""); list(name = ""Geoff McMullan"", ids = ""3588916""); list(name = ""Nigel G Ternan"", ids = ""5345007"")",1710f1b847c48e3e39459d064f547d52bd0a9afe; b7399411ff91a388d49197b28c6a9830fcff0abf; 88b4d2f127bbb986eb2242478296c1d3fb2fc9ce; 71d34c21c71008fe7fb3f284d36107053c4e8fd6; 9ee80c32fa316cc7d507baf3cacc75aba7030f3e; bd705178fa379272e700280855c91702d7330300; c193e1e99f8822dcd96cc63bb51c8bf2af40b88d; 6722919beb877d8a3a821253e5fb9c9fd80d1008; c9a7e03710645984f035c321e94c99731dbb0ab9; 26594af7c58d83cf7a3a7a03839873877c36bfe6,,FEMS microbiology letters,312 2,"

f78208c0b99fbc206c2c6000aeceb0f1f132d96c,Coordinate Based Random Effect Size meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies,"Low power in neuroimaging studies can make them difficult to interpret, and Coordinate based metaâ€ analysis (CBMA) may go some way to mitigating this issue. CBMA has been used in many analyses to detect where published functional MRI or voxel-based morphometry studies testing similar hypotheses report significant summary results (coordinates) consistently. Only the reported coordinates and possibly t statistics are analysed, and statistical significance of clusters is determined by coordinate density. Here a method of performing coordinate based random effect size meta-analysis and meta-regression is introduced. The algorithm (ClusterZ) analyses both coordinates and reported t statistic or Z score, standardised by the number of subjects. Statistical significance is determined not by coordinate density, but by a random effects meta-analyses of reported effects performed cluster-wise using standard statistical methods and taking account of censoring inherent in the published summary results. Type 1 error control is achieved using the false cluster discovery rate (FCDR), which is based on the false discovery rate. This controls both the family wise error rate under the null hypothesis that coordinates are randomly drawn from a standard stereotaxic space, and the proportion of significant clusters that are expected under the null. Such control is vital to avoid propagating and even amplifying the very issues motivating the meta-analysis in the first place. ClusterZ is demonstrated on both numerically simulated data and on real data from reports of grey matter loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) and syndromes suggestive of MS, and of painful stimulus in healthy controls.

438809a0627f959ff39fa6c1ff18c08107e09bec,Aberrant Expression of COT Is Related to Recurrence of Papillary Thyroid Cancer,"AbstractAberrant expression of Cancer Osaka Thyroid Oncogene mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (COT) (MAP3K8) is a driver of resistance to B-RAF inhibition. However, the de novo expression and clinical implications of COT in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) have not been investigated.The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of A-, B-, C-RAF, and COT in PTC (nâ€Š=â€Š167) and analyze the clinical implications of aberrant expression of these genes.Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) were performed on primary thyroid cancers. Expression of COT was compared with clinicopathological characteristics including recurrence-free survival. Datasets from public repository (NCBI) were subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).qPCR data showed that the relative mRNA expression of A-, B-, C-RAF and COT of PTC were higher than normal tissues (all Pâ€Š<â€Š0.01). In addition, the expression of COT mRNA in PTC showed positive correlation with A- (râ€Š=â€Š0.4083, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001), B- (râ€Š=â€Š0.2773, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.0003), and C-RAF (râ€Š=â€Š0.5954, Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). The mRNA expressions of A-, B,- and C-RAF were also correlated with each other (all Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). In IHC, the staining intensities of B-RAF and COT were higher in PTC than in normal tissue (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001). Interestingly, moderate-to-strong staining intensities of B-RAF and COT were more frequent in B-RAFV600E-positive PTC (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.001, Pâ€Š=â€Š0.013, respectively). In addition, aberrant expression of COT was related to old age at initial diagnosis (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.045) and higher recurrence rate (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.025). In multivariate analysis, tumor recurrence was persistently associated with moderate-to-strong staining of COT after adjusting for age, sex, extrathyroidal extension, multifocality, T-stage, N-stage, TNM stage, and B-RAFV600E mutation (odds ratio, 4.662; 95% confidence interval 1.066â€Šâˆ’â€Š21.609; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.045). Moreover, moderate-to-strong COT expression in PTC was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (mean follow-up duration, 14.2â€ŠÂ±â€Š4.1 years; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.0403).

4bb8e92d5afe5a1d3c9d11ad10da5102561f8961,IL1B polymorphisms modulate cystic fibrosis lung disease.,"RATIONALE
Variability in pulmonary disease severity is found in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have identical mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. We hypothesized that one factor accounting for heterogeneity in pulmonary disease severity is variation in the family of genes affecting the biology of interleukin-1 (IL-1), which impacts acquisition and maintenance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in animal models of chronic infection.


METHODS
We genotyped 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-1 gene cluster in 808 CF subjects from the University of North Carolina and Case Western Reserve University (UNC/CWRU) joint cohort. All were homozygous for DeltaF508, and categories of ""severe"" (cases) or ""mild"" (control subjects) lung disease were defined by the lowest or highest quartile of forced expired volume (FEV(1)) for age in the CF population. After adjustment for age and gender, genotypic data were tested for association with lung disease severity. Odds ratios (ORs) comparing severe versus mild CF were also calculated for each genotype (with the homozygote major allele as the reference group) for all 58 SNPs. From these analyses, nine SNPs with a moderate effect size, OR < or =0.5 or >1.5, were selected for further testing. To replicate the case-control study results, we genotyped the same nine SNPs in a second population of CF parent-offspring trios (recruited from Children's Hospital Boston), in which the offspring had similar pulmonary phenotypes. For the trio analysis, both family-based and population-based associations were performed.


RESULTS
SNPs rs1143634 and rs1143639 in the IL1B gene demonstrated a consistent association with lung disease severity categories (P < 0.10) and longitudinal analysis of lung disease severity (P < 0.10) in CF in both the case-control and family-based studies. In females, there was a consistent association (false discovery rate adjusted joint P-value <0.06 for both SNPs) in both the analysis of lung disease severity in the UNC/CWRU cohort and the family-based analysis of affection status.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that IL1beta is a clinically relevant modulator of CF lung disease.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hara Levy"", ids = ""36981552""); list(name = ""Amy Murphy"", ids = ""116595224""); list(name = ""Fei Zou"", ids = ""49098245""); list(name = ""Craig GÃ©rard"", ids = ""71564188""); list(name = ""Barbara J.

885ee855c62573946376bc70b6748e7e576d4724,Functional MRI detection of activation in the primary gustatory cortices in humans.,"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has recently revealed that the transitions between the parietal operculum (Pop) and the insula (area G) and the ventral end of the central sulcus (cs) were activated with the shortest latency by instrumental gustatory stimulation, which suggests that the location of the primary gustatory area is in these two regions. However, studies using other noninvasive brain-imaging methods such as positron-emission tomography or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with manual application of tastants into the mouth have been unable to confirm this. The present study examined cortical activation by repetitive stimulation of the tongue tip with 1 M NaCl with a computer-controlled stimulator and used fMRI to detect it. In individual brains, activations were detected with multiple comparisons (false discovery rate) across the whole brain corrected (threshold at P < 0.05) at both area G and frontal operculum (Fop) in 8 of 11 subjects and at the rolandic operculum (Rop) in 7 subjects. Activations were also found at the ventral end of the cs (n = 3). Group analysis with random-effect models (multiple comparison using familywise error in regions of interest, P < 0.02) revealed activation at area G in both hemispheres and in the Fop, Rop, and ventral end of the cs on the left side. The present study revealed no activation on the gyrus of the external cerebral surface except for the Rop. Taking MEG findings into consideration, the present findings strongly indicate that the primary gustatory area is present at both the transition between the Pop and insula and the Rop including the gray matter within a ventral part of the cs.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hisashi Ogawa"", ids = ""46635272""); list(name = ""Masahito Wakita"", ids = ""38259513""); list(name = ""Kayoko Hasegawa"", ids = ""47571414""); list(name = ""Tatsu Kobayakawa"", ids = ""2806826""); list(name = ""Norio Sakai"", ids = ""145698929""); list(name = ""Toshinori Hirai"", ids = ""144377954""); list(name = ""Yuki Yamashita"", ids = ""1873708""); list(name = ""Sachiko Saito"", ids = ""48862042"")",53949a8ad475cbd4cb7e3a8258a44dbe6fcc48b2; 45bdc9dd634ae9cfb6e5b86fdfdf0b7316743cc4; 0a0393ee4347ab171f7ae8f9e44b7670b0e16092; 5fccb5e6ac8f28efefbb98afcb9eec8a34255b87; 6463bcaafcdd9f0443ee6adee279de71864adf18; 8d329e0f483b58af9e667c3bb66506315683cd17; 0ff00ea459a537c829eda300fea062b4c89aa4d8; bb302155291b78de6c0e8d3824988f5b957ec532; c5881ad3b0e12beff58b226be91d3a3c89e458a4; 2f9b7be27663f3bd9412b96059420f958f6e6d68; 0926720e97005538ccdbb849d2c8c9f477923b14; 0e2d94bb796400de88242da11a3c600ddc3e732b; 0eb6ef7fb773130f7095a016c5afa8adb1932ce6; b1b4a50f624525d92ee9e061701c14232fc37769; d2d7284a775d0258a07dfa6d965555c9bf44c643; 62422bf23531b88579e9efdacc8ebbfc4eac2d29; 5e7843a6b00e70ece6c7e8e5339d7bb9443c96ff; 58fa554f17f5ae7e827760807dad01d779bf4bec; 4ef697fb390d274a07ada164253aa973ea7abe59; 8000cb21a85da3e32b9f754bf7a3ac6f51761410; e7e48251cdf7e37648c5d64ff776e86a68c9ef7e; 1a8c260febd97fc22545845517e423b723b2668e; c6f7a92e743467c7b7e94bb5838f86ed00a8a0ad; 12fb68c9c443ca6a9f60f4f781889ede9413b27e; fac49515082e5eb9997abaa4f56f14cf1dcf2715; 0d0957dcbbbb9e5a659b7af404e7f6da475d4346; 632266aeb87d1421c158364bff7f320e3d1b3e28; c0cec527dc729ad54fb882941b20c568057e8ccb; 7f2659bce83ba60c81d412d865a812f978b6a115; 5460f3a7d368b23f087e86c312b6ad83665218ab; f9b6d4c896d3d6d1d6cc1f9f349c99d772ec9730; c18c359ccf6bc638e4e9a61f8a0a882a63cdaa56; e2132c8787543d5c68c7fde59561ed5a434df547; 078790a8a9a446194b993083574f3fcb8fec6e5c; eb326b835ae4e474d874780edd4b55cbf3c1792c; 7f6b494396346cd667e2d79ce59ca555b586759c; f4c41dab0095ec162d01899f849990a1987f6764; ef2b5fe24f41603065610a0b518982a8664f0427; 8b512b96cc20e9a72695eb9e948ae0ab3aa45109; 1830bad701576082703b2eeadfd5ec9316e4b108; 4b345243942bc19a00c038e9cc8b3830ea575ae8; 67bf6700cdb5db8073f291333ad25d31047dda5a; 2d28e2abc23e7847caa1b78b24f475b2e5492af1; fd8e055080cb41a76072dadf7e3bb04212a91c50; 1aed322d9ebe0ba1275687645104728f008c70b3; a618cceaadf36ff999a7076a0b965212564c8afe,261e7eaf33c8dceab22381ba3208690efc3a2f8d; 38bc5f58fb8de1f197f2f081e89f5c80802209b5; cb34f15cd846ebab049949ced9d725d0285a69d6; d9d7d788987a78e9e8907deaad0ff2a5d51838ac; 1bbf17ef54efb0b72c715fbfc6d0b80e9873d704; 87f4e30fff93541f59a60df9bb696f8c9d228e2e; 3be309e840253faf8520b41e6121019583903111; 4986e24b7062571e3150d90627236d3b9140d7a6; 33cd1302450e9ee1ac42952f3a9c2f59335e45c4; 496775ba0674aad92291cca7f32096354fba2b18; 2ef78dc9efee6c484485f55ab9683c1d3836286e; e4ac74404e4c31d39e42bf208d51619ca8113322; 382d8e1c81b9e34c96acb667c40c8204c559516d; c8e375019bd1101038818131cb6c4048e33efe88; ff6a2440aae401eb502a27ec5766e21d68452ac6; 04edb3f87424eb803900155473ad35df45e9b1d9; daf4b187a0abd2b53676b6720ea8b034fac04299; c47242d970ecda3e2b3ba7a26aa89f32743ac49b; 4a413e1950d5b9b2a6eea96a685165aebe6decf5; 831eace0dc8934345f9d79917b953e689056a65d; 3a1978f73555b347ee28b79402b7e8cb63f8c2a6; 700dbb25e774ceaaa89113852c8ac9d42b9031a0; 01b9263a85c8a81061748b32154f90b5a725d79c; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 94e18c469cecfcd0ec6f03b3f9559db0cd97538d; 4661acd7af5d7f8708eba9522f588a84bde1d4a4; 7999ea3f3c349ab4b2677b23263d57dfc0ddddaa; 9bb8bdf7942c24bbec39c2be1e17db5704f46587; de19e3255dcc959f85d16e9b28807ca25c26b4cc; c9378efaed6198d4512ed510b3a6df615f595d7d; 6b488bbcb40d53790c81218e13e23669c80da699; da180130966ef5c40e4c48d3cb55d7d39b8aee70; 98d8b1d3c2154925a77b68fcfd66390d0fb2679e; 08c75e9e0b700156becb445b5baa1ae9674db2e5; ef3a54b9d35c1d74a5572b8a41d2bec5c9349029; 0ec32c0c9b6d082d441229c401611734ec7cd550; 3a9852662d562e1824f500fcec1ea6f878c7e800; 4b7ea8694dce7c46d0bd61898c35b39ce876c8cf; 925288bc329b57244f9bb930428afa7cb08da624; 55e245bb267f6d0878234e6ef5d0ebcc9d0bf2d6; 75c2f465d59739dbc06b70fd34dc3c1b2336103e; 90d80bdc92dbf1387c844824c3a3bc569e37b84a; 675ae235c5f068f606293cdfd093e61c340d7f6e; c87545fca399192424caa3386574512a325235d1; 6845572bfc15481b5c1b7a8fb83894423fa52bfb,Chemical senses,30 7,"

8b2a978d5f5ab5a132438a039bb61f96da8b764e,Transcriptomic Identification of ADH1B as a Novel Candidate Gene for Obesity and Insulin Resistance in Human Adipose Tissue in Mexican Americans from the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES),"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease that is more prevalent in ethnic groups such as Mexican Americans, and is strongly associated with the risk factors obesity and insulin resistance. The goal of this study was to perform whole genome gene expression profiling in adipose tissue to detect common patterns of gene regulation associated with obesity and insulin resistance. We used phenotypic and genotypic data from 308 Mexican American participants from the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES). Basal fasting RNA was extracted from adipose tissue biopsies from a subset of 75 unrelated individuals, and gene expression data generated on the Illumina BeadArray platform. The number of gene probes with significant expression above baseline was approximately 31,000. We performed multiple regression analysis of all probes with 15 metabolic traits. Adipose tissue had 3,012 genes significantly associated with the traits of interest (false discovery rate, FDR â‰¤ 0.05). The significance of gene expression changes was used to select 52 genes with significant (FDR â‰¤ 10(-4)) gene expression changes across multiple traits. Gene sets/Pathways analysis identified one gene, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) that was significantly enriched (P < 10(-60)) as a prime candidate for involvement in multiple relevant metabolic pathways. Illumina BeadChip derived ADH1B expression data was consistent with quantitative real time PCR data. We observed significant inverse correlations with waist circumference (2.8 x 10(-9)), BMI (5.4 x 10(-6)), and fasting plasma insulin (P < 0.001). These findings are consistent with a central role for ADH1B in obesity and insulin resistance and provide evidence for a novel genetic regulatory mechanism for human metabolic diseases related to these traits.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Deidre A.

1d511270503787c9ae5aebe45c767d4e54e439fe,Comparison of Algorithms for Profile-Based Alignment of Low Resolution MALDI-ToF Spectra,"Recently MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry has become major technique for the analysis of complex protein mixtures. For large studies or when data from different machines are compared, a problem of shifts of peaks between spectra becomes very urgent, especially in low resolution data. In our study we compare different profile-based alignment algorithms using a virtual instrument.We investigate the performance of algorithms through different simulation scenarios and indicate their weaknesses and strengths by a few commonly used statistical measures. We propose a modification of the peak alignment by fast Fourier transform algorithm, which significantly improved its robustness by reducing alignment artefacts and over alignments. Spectral alignment is an indispensable element in the MS data pre-processing. PAFFT algorithm with our modification may be a good MS spectra pre-processing tool, by achieving high sensitivity and keeping false discovery rate at a reasonably low level.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Michal Marczyk"", ids = ""50273817""); list(name = ""Joanna PolaÅ„ska"", ids = ""49399310""); list(name = ""Andrzej Polanski"", ids = ""1734647"")",,,,,193-201
b0679b35d16bb46a95912fa8013b8e0cdc09d0f7,Proteasome gene upregulation: a possible mechanism for intestinal adaptation.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE
The mechanisms that control intestinal adaptation remain unknown. To better understand the adaptive process, microarray technology was used to analyze gene expression in a rat model of intestinal adaptation.


METHODS
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either a massive small bowel resection (70%) with anastomosis or a sham operation with small bowel transection and reanastomosis. After 21 days, ileal mucosa RNA was extracted. Individual RNA samples (n = 5 per group) were labeled and hybridized to 10 separate RAE 230A rat GeneChips. The signal values were calculated and the 2 groups were compared using a t test with the multiple testing correction of Benjamini and Hochberg (false discovery rate of 10%). Probe sets were analyzed for overrepresented physiologic pathways using Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE).


RESULTS
Of the 15,866 probe sets on the RAE 230A GeneChip, 5437 probe sets were unexpressed and excluded. Of the remaining 10,429 probe sets, several overrepresented pathways (EASE score <0.01 after Bonferroni correction) were identified. Further analysis revealed that 13 probe sets related to proteasome degradation (an enzyme complex implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation) were significantly upregulated in the intestinal adaptation group compared to the sham group.


CONCLUSIONS
Proteasomes may play a critical role in regulating the proliferation of intestinal mucosa during intestinal adaptation.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David M.

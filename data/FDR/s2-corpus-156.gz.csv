61c977b2e6abedb4c16c6549fc6bf1824a05496c,DNA methylome profiling of all-cause mortality in comparison with age-associated methylation patterns,"BackgroundMultiple epigenome-wide association studies have been performed to identify DNA methylation patterns regulated by aging or correlated with risk of death. However, the inter-relatedness of the epigenetic basis of aging and mortality has not been well investigated.MethodsUsing genome-wide DNA methylation data from the Lothian Birth Cohorts, we conducted a genome-wide association analysis of all-cause mortality and compared this with age-associated methylation patterns reported on the same samples.ResultsSurvival analysis using the Cox regression model identified 2552 CpG sites with genome-wide significance (false discovery rate <â€‰0.05) for all-cause mortality. CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with increased mortality appear more distributed from the gene body to the intergenic regions whereas CpGs whose methylation levels are associated with decreased mortality is more concentrated at the promoter regions. In comparison with reported CpGs displaying significant age-dependent methylation patterns in the same samples, we observed a limited but highly significant overlap between mortality-associated and age-associated CpGs (p value 2.52eâˆ’06). Most importantly, the overlapping CpGs are dominated by those whose overall age-related methylation patterns reduce the risk of death.ConclusionAll-cause mortality is significantly associated with altered methylation at multiple genomic sites with differential distribution in gene regions for CpGs correlated with increased or decreased risk of death. The age-dependent methylation changes could reflect an active response to the aging process that contributes to maintain individual survival.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jesper Beltoft Lund"", ids = ""145469170""); list(name = ""Shuxia Li"", ids = ""48831092""); list(name = ""Jan Baumbach"", ids = ""50663740""); list(name = ""Anne Marie Svane"", ids = ""3334077""); list(name = ""Jacob V B Hjelmborg"", ids = ""145123814""); list(name = ""Lene Christiansen"", ids = ""144961043""); list(name = ""Kaare Christensen"", ids = ""144061761""); list(name = ""Paul Redmond"", ids = ""144631333""); list(name = ""Riccardo E.

To investigate the underlying molecular events invoked by zinc depletion we performed a temporal analysis of transcriptome changes observed within the zebrafish gill. This tissue represents a model system for studying ion absorption across polarised epithelial cells as it provides a major pathway for fish to acquire zinc directly from water whilst sharing a conserved zinc transporting system with mammals.ResultsZebrafish were treated with either zinc-depleted (water = 2.61 Î¼g L-1; diet = 26 mg kg-1) or zinc-adequate (water = 16.3 Î¼g L-1; diet = 233 mg kg-1) conditions for two weeks. Gill samples were collected at five time points and transcriptome changes analysed in quintuplicate using a 16K oligonucleotide array. Of the genes represented the expression of a total of 333 transcripts showed differential regulation by zinc depletion (having a fold-change greater than 1.8 and an adjusted P-value less than 0.1, controlling for a 10% False Discovery Rate). Down-regulation was dominant at most time points and distinct sets of genes were regulated at different stages. Annotation enrichment analysis revealed that 'Developmental Process' was the most significantly overrepresented Biological Process GO term (P = 0.0006), involving 26% of all regulated genes. There was also significant bias for annotations relating to development, cell cycle, cell differentiation, gene regulation, butanoate metabolism, lysine degradation, protein tyrosin phosphatases, nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide metabolism, and cellular metabolic processes. Within these groupings genes associated with diabetes, bone/cartilage development, and ionocyte proliferation were especially notable. Network analysis of the temporal expression profile indicated that transcription factors foxl1, wt1, nr5a1, nr6a1, and especially, hnf4a may be key coordinators of the homeostatic response to zinc depletion.ConclusionsThe study revealed the complex regulatory pathways that allow the organism to subtly respond to the low-zinc condition. Many of the processes affected reflected a fundamental restructuring of the gill epithelium through reactivation of developmental programs leading to stem cell differentiation. The specific regulation of genes known to be involved in development of diabetes provides new molecular links between zinc deficiency and this disease. The present study demonstrates the importance of including the time-dimension in microarray studies.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dongling Zheng"", ids = ""34962647""); list(name = ""Peter Kille"", ids = ""2097439""); list(name = ""Graham P.

7a1b769740fd57e9a9d70e11c32a6e63097bb0f4,Interleukin-27 is a potential marker for the onset of post-transplant malignancies,"Background
Malignancies represent the third leading cause of post-transplant mortality worldwide. The main challenge for transplant physicians is a timely diagnosis of this condition. The aim of the study was to identify a soluble diagnostic marker for monitoring the development of post-transplant malignancies.


Methods
This is a multicentre, observational, perspective, case-control study. We enrolled 47 patients with post-transplant solid neoplasia. As a control group we employed 106 transplant recipients without a history of neoplasia and matched them with cases for the main demographic and clinical features. We investigated the transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from kidney graft recipients with and without post-transplant malignancies enrolled in two of the participating centres, randomly selected from the whole study population. Microarray results were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the remaining patients from the same transplant centres and validated in a further independent group enrolled in two different transplant centres.


Results
We identified 535 differentially expressed genes comparing patients with and without post-transplant malignancies (fold changeâ€‰â‰¥2.5; false discovery rateâ€‰<5%). The cancer pathway was closely related to gene expression data, and one of the most down-regulated genes in this pathway was interleukin-27 (IL-27), a cytokine regulating anti-tumour immunity. Quantitative PCR and ELISA confirmed the microarray data. Interestingly, IL-27 plasma levels were able to discriminate patients with post-transplant neoplasia with a specificity of 80% and a sensitivity of 81%. This observation was confirmed in an independent set of patients from two different transplant centres.


Conclusions
Our data suggest that IL-27 may represent a potential immunological marker for the timely identification of post-transplant neoplasia.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paola Pontrelli"", ids = ""5375848""); list(name = ""Federica Rascio"", ids = ""49204173""); list(name = ""Gianluigi Zaza"", ids = ""144331674""); list(name = ""Matteo Accetturo"", ids = ""2826222""); list(name = ""Simona Simone"", ids = ""145042448""); list(name = ""Barbara Infante"", ids = ""144027782""); list(name = ""Lucrezia Furian"", ids = ""5489432""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Castellano"", ids = ""31959881""); list(name = ""Pasquale Ditonno"", ids = ""6585992""); list(name = ""Michele Battaglia"", ids = ""82558192""); list(name = ""Luigi Cormio"", ids = ""3072506""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Carrieri"", ids = ""2402742""); list(name = ""Antonio Lupo"", ids = ""143889787""); list(name = ""Paolo Rigotti"", ids = ""5525306""); list(name = ""Loreto Gesualdo"", ids = ""49199439""); list(name = ""Giovanni Stallone"", ids = ""5788542""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Grandaliano"", ids = ""4541303"")",51a7f77a5dc3a08a19ccd70cab67e617d59317fa; 1b4e5c6c0d429b235a44772e315c70c643702a42,7a9b129b7553e67d3d62f9ad06ad2f42d97acc99; dd6b28180636884f8128a07b3c84914bcb4af6f9; 295351eb0aed05d47236fdfc38abf710cb3c7576; fa9134069165f345c416e781e798fc3fc22b6bba; 9082a0ba357f97bb44c6bbaff39b65ae08a08db3; ca6a67651346bcae8735c18a0a4555aca3062270; 5284a7c1f81011f058a0bbb6363f1a779721c7b4; 7df30fcbd27bbb3da787d86ece6986d16d088760; 904846e1d48c05f2213eb22100db365ff5bfe931; 7233b54bd5dc6c2d85e8197450aacdfdb76bff20; c1fa8dfbf4d636b3986813a62fd177c05eee97f1; 0927a2af8c830e5f734f151babbc055103988d29; cf077a1257f31367014cee06336eeed3bfce56a5; 0eb9f6fb6cf93e69eac217164fe68d06f12ade89; 4fc348ef85ded3cf631488a37ecbbe3dc21da43a; 146def83ad7186ebc8821a75ac710dd843dbcb15; e8402813fe3633e3fed9652303fd3d17fa15db89; 1f1f9982b4498f55ed395f4ba53f716207504a67; 4d22591996462400f2f0550e0fce8b3b52a8f5ab; b4b1c8f601866fb069ddf4d128f6311b0b94c8d4; 21745256c261af2642c036fb19c0efa773ea7112; 55c370905dec9d0089ab6a5f028670d633fa6ee1; ef0df8ed982069467ebf8609e645afc695e23898; d43e9a01ef52abe85701c7f06dc62a400de7e797; 7ce4315073644def8a13c2b6e7c9eb403558a93d; 194b17c1ea8340ed2e89f2266bfc4d7f895e4d0e; d664c6d9c77bd7110b6660523402311da866d7cd; dbf030662faa204eb03b2f23da13fdaa70af17f0; 1db2f353858e150b9e2c8cb342db62861b0a40fc,Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,34,157â€“166
fce009e245d2af43003c7bf7dd34d4ecd0476a05,"The optimal discovery procedure for large-scale significance testing, with applications to comparative microarray experiments.","As much of the focus of genetics and molecular biology has shifted toward the systems level, it has become increasingly important to accurately extract biologically relevant signal from thousands of related measurements. The common property among these high-dimensional biological studies is that the measured features have a rich and largely unknown underlying structure. One example of much recent interest is identifying differentially expressed genes in comparative microarray experiments. We propose a new approach aimed at optimally performing many hypothesis tests in a high-dimensional study. This approach estimates the optimal discovery procedure (ODP), which has recently been introduced and theoretically shown to optimally perform multiple significance tests. Whereas existing procedures essentially use data from only one feature at a time, the ODP approach uses the relevant information from the entire data set when testing each feature. In particular, we propose a generally applicable estimate of the ODP for identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments. This microarray method consistently shows favorable performance over five highly used existing methods. For example, in testing for differential expression between two breast cancer tumor types, the ODP provides increases from 72% to 185% in the number of genes called significant at a false discovery rate of 3%.

13efda18e602566dce38434ee7d92eadd16cb7d0,Volatilomic insight of head and neck cancer via the effects observed on saliva metabolites,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a heterogeneous malignant disease with distinct global distribution. Metabolic adaptations of HNC are significantly gaining clinical interests nowadays. Here, we investigated effects of HNC on differential expression of volatile metabolites in human saliva. We applied headspace solid phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of saliva samples collected from 59 human subjects (HNC âˆ’ 32, Control âˆ’ 27). We identified and quantified 48 volatile organic metabolites (VOMs) and observed profound effects of HNC on these metabolites. These effects were VOM specific and significantly differed in the biologically comparable healthy controls. HNC induced changes in salivary VOM composition were well attributed to in vivo metabolic effects. A panel of 15 VOMs with variable importance in projection (VIP) score >1, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and log2 fold change (log2 FC) value of â‰¥0.58/â‰¤âˆ’0.58 were regarded as discriminatory metabolites of pathophysiological importance. Afterwards, receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) projected certain VOMs viz., 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2-decanediol, 2,5-bis1,1-dimethylethylphenol and E-3-decen-2-ol with profound metabolic effects of HNC and highest class segregation potential. Moreover, metabolic pathways analysis portrayed several dysregulated pathways in HNC, which enhanced our basic understanding on salivary VOM changes. Our observations could redefine several known/already investigated systemic phenomenons (e.g. biochemical pathways). These findings will inspire further research in this direction and may open unconventional avenues for non-invasive monitoring of HNC and its therapy in the future.",2018,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Ravindra Taware"", ids = ""12618494""); list(name = ""Khushman Taunk"", ids = ""5920410""); list(name = ""Jorge A M Pereira"", ids = ""145237608""); list(name = ""Amey Shirolkar"", ids = ""3971028""); list(name = ""Dharmesh Soneji"", ids = ""47706498""); list(name = ""JosÃ© S CÃ¢mara"", ids = ""48801785""); list(name = ""H A Nagarajaram"", ids = ""35165751""); list(name = ""Srikanth Rapole"", ids = ""6826161"")",fef638626595e7757dc9765c3950155923dcb7ff; 063ce520dc4a8d56f8077b2e0f4ec5d05f3b7b85; 571203dad7a5edd87dd9f8215c3cd936518de8a5,e79e398d97dcd37fbafb06733f04acfe0c18639b; 88b2fe86282339c3cee2c604ae281d648b96e5a4; d4c667a83ef3e194103228dcb9041e3830a75bb3; 3646f2a043da05309750ac284cd40e4d707607ba; a8bf1e606faf8eacc83e0b1fa3df64ce657dbf7a; ebc57ac1052fa7be6fb74f31235613958948ed77; 1231ce037cd760947aa343f933bc77e2a10e5026; 628c12d08a4f1563f066fe98e52ec85a56ee91e7; 00975809d1d3b1960b1c48111dcd9912588f69a3; 695b283bac33b679d50c83cee0bb6cc7f6f1a744; 3737a6e794cdc93fbe861de94ceb2b542a8d3116; c873c6d009fda50ec4c242dfeac72b9aca9c7424; fc592d61af4e866cd3fba6b52bcf3a34a6715e5d; 8213908de3230a873b2a46ee460d39e3a374b7bf; f09f07085891495bae4aac659f83f2aaec4c04ff; a54a133562ca25a8955711f9292c2eedbeefb6c6; 1d1dc45affc9c015f343b0e7ff6f85898ef0d1ed; e5aad3ee7adfeac70261138a6aaa8bd115351798; 9773dfdca5941379c4da4537a56627dc4130bc70; 85adb8dc6e3f3e9210382c7281ac0ac91f367006; 66a6a6e6539d3a8b6073e3a627ed0bd400e90d86; e2a78a8d27dbb74ce0e9462e4e3166aca321e2a8; 89fb6f9fd6715154a001c46b6b887c2b4e6a003b; 10afb808b1015c5a0ac0e4a063537327b775d540; 801030ed1d2318dec58f74e661dac7d3136fb878; 95917ab13104393dc111fa1e6870a77e9b7ddf91; 8840993fe83bde2f041e5075cea30a2de5d203a8; 70011ecc121ebbe8ce8710ddc7d81935189a03ad; 7af69fcd1f05845a83774bf91f3a88e58e466967; adcaa24d3384884547eac00bfc3c03844c8c8f53; 2f89400fd46b8003c33a38d2f0fc462670e3ba8b; 2c8d75601e20623d93d0651ceb4f6ea407838341; 366c17b1fec035738a6d3b643b2773d0dc51b4fe; 38bebe97267c18f0c65bbe2fbe62bfe04bdf168f; 67f50cebd65d43e1dfd983ecae9add495ef35ec0; db8bf1a3e75bf3aae20fa57c102ad393e948a999; ea16b31bd22515a60af5a49ebb20339eda877767; 328d7c4dc5d15fc780e17504d94566cf1a200ec9; 90cbb9e443b8baba74e290f25a939b1e7ef52749; 2897a5ac4784a8de782eb0931db4f07e4197a0d5; dfbc0d2b61e57519fda288df6b6f7f50f4c9db70; dfc8fbafe7848ce01b8589b798445887c777b515; cc432290f92b74f146111f48c88a5e22029b147e; 6ad536459ce2dbb15657395920cb203ccdb1463f; d9aabb916114b7bf04504733ec37390bab76b717; 928c91cdc48e0dbb8781394c6f9f0ddc23c017da; 234a6c9098a7256ec3aba73c2ffb6167db786ad0; 373f2654ea6fbf5f5c1a494057c5fa8714371cc2; 898800a43ae26d2055e16c3a6219bafc84ed8397; 16490e40cc7771aacae10de825d1db6de44bd243; 5fc4400e28cfe2715e2b93c4198fbf3ec8fd52ba,Scientific Reports,8,
bd7df04bb8ee41d7484d86716944819e832cf0b3,Epistasis analysis links immune cascades and cerebral amyloidosis,"BackgroundSeveral lines of evidence suggest the involvement of neuroinflammatory changes in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pathophysiology such as amyloidosis and neurodegeneration. In fact, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown a link between genes involved in neuroinflammation and AD. In order to further investigate whether interactions between candidate genetic variances coding for neuroinflammatory molecules are associated with brain amyloid Î² (AÎ²) fibrillary accumulation, we conducted an epistasis analysis on a pool of genes associated with molecular mediators of inflammation.Methods[18F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was employed to assess brain AÎ² levels in 417 participants from ADNI-GO/2 and posteriorly 174 from ADNI-1. IL-1Î², IL4, IL6, IL6r, IL10, IL12, IL18, C5, and C9 genes were chosen based on previous studies conducted in AD patients. Using the [18F]florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) as a quantitative measure of fibrillary AÎ², epistasis analyses were performed between two sets of markers of immune-related genes using gender, diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) as covariates. Voxel-based analyses were also conducted. The results were corrected for multiple comparison tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AÎ²1-42/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio concentrations were used to confirm such associations.ResultsEpistasis analysis unveiled two significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP interactions (false discovery rate (FDR) threshold 0.1), both interactions between C9 gene (rs261752) and IL6r gene (rs4240872, rs7514452). In a combined sample, the interactions were confirmed (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰10â€“5) and associated with amyloid accumulation within cognitively normal and AD spectrum groups. Voxel-based analysis corroborated initial findings. CSF biomarker (AÎ²1-42/p-tau) confirmed the genetic interaction. Additionally, rs4240872 and rs7514452 SNPs were shown to be associated with CSF and plasma concentrations of IL6r protein.ConclusionsCertain allele combinations involving IL6r and C9 genes are associated with AÎ² burden in the brain. Hypothesis-driven search for epistasis is a valuable strategy for investigating imaging endophenotypes in complex neurodegenerative diseases.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrea L.

77a8398a70d40a77eb70623e3a92ddcbab094781,Genome-Wide Association Study of Yield and Component Traits in Pacific Northwest Winter Wheat,"Grain yield and agronomic traits, key breeding goals for most crops, are under complex genetic control and subject to environmental interactions. Plant breeders require that the genetic architecture of agronomic traits be identified in locally relevant germplasm. Our goal was to conduct a genome-wide association study to identify quantitative trait loci for eight agronomic traits in a diversity panel containing 402 Pacific Northwest winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines. Phenotypic evaluations of yield, yield components, phenology, and plant height were conducted under drought, rainfed, and irrigated conditions in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Linkage disequilibrium analysis, using 6492 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from the 9K SNP array, determined that 70% of markers were in significant LD with other markers and formed 539 LD blocks with an average distance of 3.5 cM. Population structure analysis was conducted using 719 SNP tags that represent marker distribution. Three genetic subgroups were identified in the population, explaining 3 to 38% of the total phenotypic variation. A mixed linear model with 3653 SNP markers of known genetic position, the first two membership coefficients (Q = 2) of population structure and a compressed kinship (Kc = 192) was used in the association analysis. In this study, a total of 94 marker-trait associations that were significant (false discovery rate < 0.05) were identified. Multiple trait associations for yield and component traits were identified on chromosomes 2B, 4B, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 7B. These findings highlight the possibility of using historical recombination in northern latitude winter wheat to identify genomic regions associated with desired agronomic traits.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Shiferaw Abate Gizaw"", ids = ""41092336""); list(name = ""Jayfred Gaham V.

2e587234926aecf1d0cfe83a993ff4daddf15199,S1190 The Impact of Infliximab Therapy On Colonic Mucosal Expression of Barrier Genes in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Introduction and aim: Intestinal epithelial barrier function is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it remains unclear whether this dysfunction is a primary event of IBD or a consequence ofmucosal inflammation. This study investigated the impact of anti-inflammatory therapy with infliximab on the colonic mucosal expression of genes related to intestinal epithelial barrier function in IBD patients using oligonucleotide arrays. Methods: The expression of 121 genes related to intestinal epithelial barrier function, including IBD candidate susceptibility genes, mucins, trefoils, E-cadherin, genes involved in the apical junction complex function, were investigated in colonic mucosal biopsies obtained at endoscopy from 43 IBD patients with active colitis (24 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 19 Crohn's disease (CD)) before and 4-6 weeks after first infliximab infusion. The patients were classified for response to infliximab based on endoscopic and histologic findings: 20 responders (12 CD and 8 UC) and 23 non-responders (7 CD and 16 UC). Six control patients undergoing colonoscopy for screening were included. Total RNA was isolated, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Microarray data was analyzed using Bioconductor software. Moderated t-statistic was used for comparative data analysis. A false discovery rate 2 fold-change were considered statistically significant. Results: There was no significant difference between UC and CD at baseline. In UC and CD, the mRNA expression levels of MUC1, MUC4, MUC5B, MCAM, TFF1, CLDN1, CLDN2, JAM2 and TLR4 were all upregulated at baseline compared to controls, while the mRNA expression levels of MUC20, CLDN23, CLDN8, MPP5, MPP7, CDH1, SLC22A4, SLC22A5, ABCB1 and PDZD3 were all downregulated at baseline compared to controls. In responders to anti-TNFalpha treatment, the expression levels of TFF1, TFF2, CLDN2, CLDN8, SORBS1, ABCB1 and DSG3 in UC and CLDN1 in UC and CD normalized after treatment. In CD (not in UC) responders, MUC1 and MUC4 mRNA expression remained increased and CXADR and SLC22A5 mRNA expression remained decreased after complete healing in comparison with controls. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that the expression of many barrier genes is dysregulated in the colon of active IBD. After healing of the mucosa with infliximab therapy, the expression of most of these genes was restored in UC, while in CD the expression of a number of barrier genes remained dysregulated.We do not find arguments for a primary defect in barrier in UC whereas in Crohn's disease some barrier defects persist in healed colonic mucosa.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ingrid Arijs"", ids = ""48493056""); list(name = ""Roel Quintens"", ids = ""3411594""); list(name = ""Leentje Van Lommel"", ids = ""47830645""); list(name = ""Kristel Van Steen"", ids = ""47541715""); list(name = ""Gert de Hertogh"", ids = ""8009220""); list(name = ""Gert Van Van Assche"", ids = ""21439453""); list(name = ""SÃ©verine Vermeire"", ids = ""48226106""); list(name = ""Karel Geboes"", ids = ""5861730""); list(name = ""Frans Schuit"", ids = ""3016114""); list(name = ""Paul Rutgeerts"", ids = ""145334297"")",,,Gastroenterology,136,
b6a84f0a4754f2e2bf7053accd5418814a29e9cb,A two-step strategy for detecting differential gene expression in cDNA microarray data,"A mixed-model approach is proposed for identifying differential gene expression in cDNA microarray experiments. This approach is implemented by two interconnected steps. In the first step, we choose a subset of genes that are potentially expressed differentially among treatments with a loose criterion. In the second step, these potential genes are used for further analyses and data-mining with a stringent criterion, in which differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are confirmed and some quantities of interest (such as geneÂ Ã—Â treatment interaction) are estimated. By simulating datasets with DEGs, we compare our statistical method with a widely used method, the t-statistic, for single genes. Simulation results show that our approach produces a high power and a low false discovery rate for DEG identification. We also investigate the impacts of various source variations resulting from microarray experiments on the efficiency of DEG identification. Analysis of a published experiment studying unstable transcripts in Arabidopsis illustrates the utility of our method.

aeb486a61e86b01aecfe2cfca7cb960ac8653ed3,"Abstract 3268: Differences in expression of lncRNAs in breast tumor, adjacent normal-appearing breast tissue, and normal breast tissue from healthy donors","Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CA

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of key regulatory RNAs that are greater than 200nt and do not code for protein. They appear to be critical for various biological processes including gene regulation. Increasing evidence has suggested that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs play a key role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. In most studies of breast cancer, breast tumor tissue was compared to adjacent normal-appearing tissue to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs. However, expression of lncRNAs in normal breast tissue from healthy donors has rarely been studied, and the differences in expression of lncRNAs in breast tumor and normal breast tissue from healthy donors remain largely unknown. Using RNA-sequencing data generated from freshly-frozen breast tissue samples, we examined the expression of lncRNAs in 119 breast tumor, 47 adjacent normal-appearing breast tissue samples, and 23 normal breast tissue samples from healthy donors. Bowtie and RESM algorithms were used to align raw reads and quantify transcript abundance. Differential expression analyses were performed using edgeR software. We assessed the expression of a total of 7,844 mapped lncRNAs using normalized transcript counts. Unsupervised Principal Components Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the lncRNA expression profile of adjacent normal-appearing tissue was different compared to normal breast tissue from healthy donors, and partially overlapped with the tumor. At various fold change thresholds, more differentially expressed lncRNAs can be detected when the tumor tissue is compared to normal tissue than to adjacent non-tumorous tissue. With a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change (FC) of more than Â±2, we identified 107 differentially expressed lncRNAs for the tumor vs. normal breast tissue, 53 lncRNAs for tumor vs. adjacent normal-appearing tissue, and 20 lncRNAs for adjacent normal-appearing vs. normal breast tissue. In our analyses of tumor vs. adjacent normal-appearing tissue and tumor vs. normal tissue from healthy donors, we identified differentially expressed lncRNAs including HOTAIR, GAS5 and ANRIL/CDKN2B-AS1 that were previously implicated in breast cancer, with considerably higher fold changes in latter comparison. When using normal breast tissue from healthy donors as the baseline, we identified novel putative breast cancer-associated lncRNAs including EMX2OS, TERC, HOTAIRM1, and WT1-AS that are aberrantly expressed in breast tumor. These lncRNAs were not identifiable in a direct comparison of tumor and adjacent normal-appearing tissue. Our results suggest that adjacent normal-appearing tissue undergoes changes in lncRNAs expression similar to those observed in tumor tissue to some extent, and a number of new and potentially important lncRNAs can only be detected using normal tissue from healthy donors as an optimal baseline tissue.

4b771b73e17a9d14bfddefe65cafad346de82a59,PGTools: A Software Suite for Proteogenomic Data Analysis and Visualization.,"We describe PGTools, an open source software suite for analysis and visualization of proteogenomic data. PGTools comprises applications, libraries, customized databases, and visualization tools for analysis of mass-spectrometry data using combined proteomic and genomic backgrounds. A single command is sufficient to search databases, calculate false discovery rates, group and annotate proteins, generate peptide databases from RNA-Seq transcripts, identify altered proteins associated with cancer, and visualize genome scale peptide data sets using sophisticated visualization tools.

943a5e53084bbcf0facc75886f1975c719184225,Title: Contextual MDPs: A New Model and PAC Guarantees for Reinforcement Learning with Rich Observations,"s: Alekh Agarwal (Microsoft Research) Title: Contextual MDPs: A New Model and PAC Guarantees for Reinforcement Learning with Rich Observations We propose and study a new tractable model for reinforcement learning with highdimensional observation called Contextual-MDPs, generalizing contextual bandits to a sequential decision making setting. These models require an agent to take actions based on high-dimensional observations (features) with the goal of achieving long-term performance competitive with a large set of policies. Since the size of the observation space is a primary obstacle to sample-efficient learning, Contextual-MDPs are assumed to be summarizable by a small number of hidden states. In this setting, we design a new reinforcement learning algorithm that engages in global exploration while using a function class to approximate future performance. We also establish a sample complexity guarantee for this algorithm, proving that it learns near optimal behavior after a number of episodes that is polynomial in all relevant parameters, logarithmic in the number of policies, and independent of the size of the observation space. This represents an exponential improvement on the sample complexity of all existing alternative approaches and provides theoretical justification for reinforcement learning with function approximation. This is joint work with Akshay Krishnamurthy and John Langford. Available online at http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02722. Jelena Bradic (UC San Diego) Title: Robust Machine Learning Recent advances in technologies for cheaper and faster data acquisition and storage have led to an explosive growth of data complexity in a variety of research areas such as high-throughput genomics, biomedical imaging, high-energy physics, astronomy and economics. As a result, noise accumulation, experimental variation and data inhomogeneity have become substantial. However, machine learning in such settings is known to pose many statistical challenges and hence calls for new methods and theories. Moreover, the impact of outliers or non-gaussianity is far from obvious. In this talk we provide two methods for machine learning that adapt to the unknown outliers in the data and we provide theoretical understanding of the impact of outliers on the learning. In particular, we propose a new boosting framework called Arch Boost. It is designed for augmenting the existing work such that its corresponding classification algorithms with non-convex losses are significantly more adaptable to unknown data contamination. Along with the Arch Boost framework, a family of non-convex losses are proposed which leads to new robust boosting algorithms, namedAdaptive Robust Boosting (ARB). Moreover, when the dimension of the feature space is high, we propose a novel, robust and sparse approximate message passing algorithm (RAMP), that is adaptive to the error distribution. Our algorithm includes many non-quadratic and non-differentiable loss functions. We derive its asymptotic mean squared error and show its convergence, while allowing p, n, s â†’ âˆž, with n/p âˆˆ (0, 1) and n/s âˆˆ (1, âˆž). Lastly, we present theoretical developments that showcase the difficulty of studying robustness in machine learning and lead to many open questions. Emmanuel CandÃ¨s (Stanford) Title: A knockoff filter for controlling the false discovery rate The big data era has created a new scientific paradigm: collect data first, ask questions later. Imagine that we observe a response variable together with a large number of potential explanatory variables, and would like to be able to discover which variables are truly associated with the response. At the same time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR)---the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries---is not too high, in order to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. We introduce the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method works by constructing fake variables, knockoffs, which can then be used as controls for the true variables; the method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, and the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. This is joint work with Rina Foygel Barber. Chen-Nee Chuah (UC Davis) Title: Network Inference with Online Learning in Software Defined Networking Network measurement and inference play a key role in different networking applications including network design, traffic engineering, and security analytics. Obtaining fine-grained measurement data under hard resource constraints is a challenging task in todayâ€™s large-scale networks. This talk will demonstrate how flexibility of software-defined networking (SDN) can be leveraged to adapt measurement rules based on optimal online strategies to augment traditional network inference techniques to obtain better estimates of network characteristics, such as traffic matrix or per-hop delay/loss rates. We will present a few case studies that demonstrate how SDN-enabled network monitoring and inference problems can benefit from theories and results from compressive sensing, multi-arm bandit, and statistical online learning. Simulation results using mininet and prototyping effort using hardware OpenFlow will be discussed. Ian Davidson (UC Davis) Title: Variations of Spectral Clustering Formulations and Challenges Spectral clustering is a commonly used method for segmenting graphs due to its ease of implementation and underpinning in spectral graph theory such as connections to min-cut of a graph. Recent variations by our selves and others involve: i) adding in guidance and constraints, ii) segmenting multiple graphs and iii) adding a human to the process via active learning. I will cover all these three settings pointing out why they are useful, existing formulations and challenges, particularly core underlying questions that remain unanswered. Cho-Jui Hsieh (UC Davis) Title: Asynchronous Parallel Optimization in Machine Learning Asynchronous parallel optimization is important for solving large-scale machine learning problems. In this talk, I will present theoretical and practical challenges of asynchronous parallel optimization, and talk about our current approaches for addressing these challenges in multi-core or distributed system. Sham Kakade (University of Washington) Title: Discovering Hidden Structure in the Sparse Regime In many applications, we face the challenge of modeling the hidden interactions between multiple observations (e.g. discovering clusters of points in space or learning topics in documents). Furthermore, an added difficulty is that our datasets often have empirical distributions which are heavy tailed tailed (e.g. problems in natural language processing). In other words, even though we have large datasets, we are often in a sparse regime where there is a large fraction of our items that have only been observed a few times (e.g. Zipfâ€™s law which states that regardless of how big our corpus of text is, a large fraction of the words in our vocabulary will only be observed a few times). The question we consider is how to learn a model of our data when our dataset is large and yet is sparse. We provide an algorithm for learning certain natural latent variable models applicable to this sparse regime, making connections to a body of recent work in sparse random graph theory and community detection. We also discuss the implications to practice. Xiaodong Li (UC Davis) Title: Wirtinger flow and thresholded Wirtinger flow By dimension lifting techniques, phase retrieval can be also viewed as a special low-rank recovery problem. Although convex methods, such as PhaseLift, are provably effective and robust, the computational complexity and storage cost could be pretty high. To address these issues, we introduce a non-convex optimization algorithm, named Wirtinger flow, with theoretically guaranteed performances. It is much more efficient than convex methods in terms of computation and memory. Finally, I will introduce how to modify Wirtinger flow into an adaptive thresholded gradient descent method given the signal is known to be sparse, in order to achieve the minimax convergence rates under l_2 loss. Miles Lopes (UC Davis) Title: Unknown Sparsity in Compressed Sensing: Denoising and Inference The theory of Compressed Sensing (CS) asserts that an unknown signal x in R can be accurately recovered from an underdetermined set of n linear measurements with n<<p, provided that x is sufficiently sparse. However, in applications, the degree of sparsity ||x||0 is typically unknown, and the problem of directly estimating ||x||0 has been a longstanding gap between theory and practice. A closely related issue is that ||x||0 is a highly idealized measure of sparsity, and for real signals with entries not equal to 0, the value ||x||0=p is not a useful description of compressibility. In our previous work that examined these problems, we considered an alternative measure of â€œsoftâ€ sparsity, (||x||1/||x||2), and designed a procedure to estimate (||x||1/||x||2) that does not rely on sparsity assumptions. The present work offers a new deconvolution-based method for estimating unknown sparsity, which has wider applicability and sharper theoretical guarantees. In particular, we introduce a family of entropy-based sparsity measures sq(x) parameterized by qâ‰¥0, which includes (||x||1/||x||2) and ||x||0 as special cases. Also, we propose an estimator for sq(x) whose relative error converges at the dimension-free rate of n, even when p/n diverges. Our main results also describe the limiting distribution of the estimator, as well as some connections to Basis Pursuit Denosing, the Lasso, deterministic measure",2016,,"list(name = ""Alexandra Navrotsky"", ids = ""91136042""); list(name = ""Vikas Sindhwani"", ids = ""1808676""); list(name = ""Cho-Jui Hsieh"", ids = ""1793529"")",,,,,
110997118e1a3e489fd0a5a29841e62da050e9a6,Six novel susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease and cerebral infarction identified by longitudinal exome-wide association studies in a Japanese population,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebral infarction (CI) remain major causes of morbidity and mortality in humans. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified various genetic variants associated with these diseases. However, these studies were commonly conducted in a cross-sectional manner. Therefore, the present research performed longitudinal exome-wide association studies for CAD and CI using data on ~244,000 genotyped variants and the clinical data of 6,026 Japanese individuals who had attended annual health checkups for several years (mean followed-up period, 5Â±3 years). Following quality controls, the significance [false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05] of association of the diseases with 24,651 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5,989 individuals for three inheritance models was tested using the generalized estimating equation model. SNPs that reached statistical significance were further screened against a threshold of approxdf (a scale of small effective sample size) of >30. The longitudinal exome-wide association studies revealed that three SNPs [rs4606855 of ADGRE3 (P=2.5Ã—10-6; FDR=0.031; approxdf=71), rs3746414 of ZFP64 (P=5.9Ã—10-6; FDR=0.048; approxdf=93) and rs7132908 of FAIM2 (P<2.0Ã—10-16; FDR<4.9Ã—10-12; approxdf=65)] were significantly associated with the prevalence of CAD. A different set of three SNPs [rs6580741 of FAM186A (P<2.0Ã—10-16; FDR<4.9Ã—10-12; approxdf=48), rs1324015 of LINC00400 (P<2.0Ã—10-16; FDR<4.9Ã—10-12; approxdf=49) and rs884205 of TNFRSF11A (P<2.0Ã—10-16; FDR<4.9Ã—10-12; approxdf=32)] was significantly associated with CI. The comparison of disease incidence with these SNPs demonstrated that all the minor alleles were associated with decreased susceptibility to CAD or CI. In conclusion, six novel SNPs were identified as susceptibility loci for CAD (rs4606855 of ADGRE3, rs3746414 of ZFP64, and rs7132908 of FAIM2) or CI (rs6580741 of FAM186A, rs1324015 of LINC00400, and rs884205 of TNFRSF11A).",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshiki Yasukochi"", ids = ""8544496""); list(name = ""Jun Sakuma"", ids = ""46764062""); list(name = ""Ichiro Takeuchi"", ids = ""3046458""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Hideki Horibe"", ids = ""3512685""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",740896698975351c52d47a7083a7b880b6ece2e1; 69a05763b0362064f1d447d3ae2d1b18323f316b,d6bdd46071663ed55ade773faa39f7757c4c79b3; dd632d96c8bd1ef0f00621d5e1d78a53d7d697fd; ced700033516a1d2654b95ebb795f744ed496676; 11f647b95a7c9a94c346cd8dc53987105cb0f7c1; 26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb; e145c029a150104800cd261877ccf4a2d96d9fc5; 20ef5b1598230791f836cd8909cd326695126cda; c35a4a4715ff441b0bf6fd9e17eef5c35f87bfc5; 63f4ea05f40d161d574b03a502dfa8657bf4064a; 41833134907a4bf1d158b7a2b86b08c49d1d71b7; 11407d37e32032155fe2b88caa42e7854297d74e; f414452b4ed0aa8268c20e0e92a8620f8e9986eb; 229f1ba958c299477c8229c75e6fe6bd9ad19110; ca42155bce5c3fac8a869f67756df81ba4ad86c7; c126a617d162b38978a63a7397993f1be619bda6; 997c7c7d2218585e8594f2f9abec7dc97e5ce3b1; c401084cfbec16bc23fb3d99fc0a534c7c6d96cb; 718454d34167c721191456cf4697eef5ab0ce0e1; c5c2a0bef5c257f18ee7c69d77872dc551f8ed18; 9771d2df7eb353df6db994223a46a911f91bbeb1; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 2c96be965c9044e716b5f815b038531a1345db5e; 947feba9136e877f50968b62fd2e6c6381376580; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; c3ebab1e7750275eeec561253751399db5cfab6d; 4f4af48ed45c9df55d0443c95c05ec527202804e; 3a14152f47cbfd38db21a3d7e6b1b8cf0a887358; 4a67810821725998d063b638cc30e199430cae7a; 120b33f95610ff61be30d6730697ec90693a4f86; 8bf84ab976a24f95378ad66ce82c72b5117670fd; a4834d5d528c7aa9f85f3356395b5492231b9b72; 5c0774390c81109a38bf14a6ed76379c71d3b207; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 459a65157592599544e150a74c2b68af2fc1e117; 1f4f4724c7604bff915326f2e268021156591b70; 9f96169ea4cbd294bc3dcf3ed590e1ce8d0747fd; d0fe60df7120e4fb86ad4a04f8390d238146970a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 1a912fed9c6bdbb1c3e91190cbdc913e6f0a3bf3; d315de990eda1e9a57c9445b25900ccf5a78e904; 15279a8a5eb4d49c4879e70c5c49bd70f6ba17ed; d6e0989e7415d8bd9356b7604b5f33371af007cb; e0b0d54f8df0ce4a090df67da2e7d7d42f7d4db6; ad032c039418ccfa07a9e3449a4007a6781c554a; ba7858553b9d4d5a9e84ac1cf0bf0c35ff9b0ce6; 6c5aaf468fee44bb45666825d4d2971e0d137973; 719422684b6857722b80cf9c73079d0043afd3c8; d7f012f3290fb4a19a4ad91557f4ae02ed65a139; 9d7af049cf76892dc1b5126c5a51cd09e08e3b5d; 666fbfd9410a97f42686beec53be5e1d58212937; 432dcf01850291943284045658cd7d17ec3bcc42,Biomedical Reports,9,123 - 134

Incorporating prior biological information has great potential to enhance statistical power but such information is often overlooked in many existent sparse regression models. We developed a unified sparse regression (USR) to incorporate prior information and jointly adjust for cryptic relatedness, population structure, and other environmental covariates. Our USR models cryptic relatedness as a random effect and population structure as fixed effect, and utilize the weighted penalties to incorporate prior knowledge. As demonstrated by extensive simulations, our USR algorithm can discover more true causal variants and maintain a lower false discovery rate than do several commonly used feature selection methods. It can handle both rare and common variants simultaneously.

52983264f20f9a4285bc0644c56672d5dc99c963,Diffuse Decreased Gray Matter in Patients with Idiopathic Craniocervical Dystonia: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies have addressed the role of structures other than the basal ganglia in the pathophysiology of craniocervical dystonia (CCD). Neuroimaging studies have attempted to identify structural abnormalities in CCD but a clear pattern of alteration has not been established. We performed whole-brain evaluation using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify patterns of gray matter (GM) changes in CCD.


METHODS
We compared 27 patients with CCD matched in age and gender to 54 healthy controls. VBM was used to compare GM volumes. We created a two-sample t-test corrected for subjects' age, and we tested with a level of significance of pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 and false discovery rate (FDR) correction (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).


RESULTS
Voxel-based morphometry demonstrated significant reductions of GM using pâ€‰<â€‰0.001 in the cerebellar vermis IV/V, bilaterally in the superior frontal gyrus, precuneus, anterior cingulate and paracingulate, insular cortex, lingual gyrus, and calcarine fissure; in the left hemisphere in the supplementary motor area, inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, temporal pole, supramarginal gyrus, rolandic operculum, hippocampus, middle occipital gyrus, cerebellar lobules IV/V, superior, and middle temporal gyri; in the right hemisphere, the middle cingulate and precentral gyrus. Our study did not report any significant result using the FDR correction. We also detected correlations between GM volume and age, disease duration, duration of botulinum toxin treatment, and the Marsden-Fahn dystonia scale scores.


CONCLUSION
We detected large clusters of GM changes chiefly in structures primarily involved in sensorimotor integration, motor planning, visuospatial function, and emotional processing.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Camila Callegari Piccinin"", ids = ""5225938""); list(name = ""Luiza Gonzaga Piovesana"", ids = ""5854385""); list(name = ""Maria Cristina Arci Santos"", ids = ""5014330""); list(name = ""Rachel Paes GuimarÃ£es"", ids = ""39652810""); list(name = ""Brunno Machado de Campos"", ids = ""38312609""); list(name = ""T J R Rezende"", ids = ""152688027""); list(name = ""Lidiane Soares Campos"", ids = ""39677858""); list(name = ""FÃ¡bio R.

7f0d11f139066d3fd782e076348f620f6ecd128d,Detection of DNA copy number alterations using penalized least squares regression,"MOTIVATION
Genomic DNA copy number alterations are characteristic of many human diseases including cancer. Various techniques and platforms have been proposed to allow researchers to partition the whole genome into segments where copy numbers change between contiguous segments, and subsequently to quantify DNA copy number alterations. In this paper, we incorporate the spatial dependence of DNA copy number data into a regression model and formalize the detection of DNA copy number alterations as a penalized least squares regression problem. In addition, we use a stationary bootstrap approach to estimate the statistical significance and false discovery rate.


RESULTS
The proposed method is studied by simulations and illustrated by an application to an extensively analyzed dataset in the literature. The results show that the proposed method can correctly detect the numbers and locations of the true breakpoints while appropriately controlling the false positives.

aed2759c7af98549ad635a1f601f190155001861,Phenotypic plasticity and genotype by environment interaction for olfactory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Genotype by environment interactions (GEI) play a major part in shaping the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and are confounding factors in genetic studies, for example, in attempts to associate genetic variation with disease susceptibility. It is generally not known what proportion of phenotypic variation is due to GEI and how many and which genes contribute to GEI. Behaviors are complex traits that mediate interactions with the environment and, thus, are ideally suited for studies of GEI. Olfactory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster presents an opportunity to systematically dissect GEI, since large numbers of genetically identical individuals can be reared under defined environmental conditions and the olfactory system of Drosophila and its behavioral response to odorants have been well characterized. We assessed variation in olfactory behavior in a population of 41 wild-derived inbred lines and asked to what extent different larval-rearing environments would influence adult olfactory behavior and whether GEI is a minor or major contributing source of phenotypic variation. We found that approximately 50% of phenotypic variation in adult olfactory behavior is attributable to GEI. In contrast, transcriptional analysis revealed that only 20 genes show GEI at the level of gene expression [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05], some of which are associated with physiological responses to environmental chemicals. Quantitative complementation tests with piggyBac-tagged mutants for 2 of these genes (CG9664 and Transferrin 1) demonstrate that genes that show transcriptional GEI are candidate genes for olfactory behavior and that GEI at the level of gene expression is correlated with GEI at the level of phenotype.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Deepa Sambandan"", ids = ""5732930""); list(name = ""Mary Anna Carbone"", ids = ""4522970""); list(name = ""Robert R H Anholt"", ids = ""143651756""); list(name = ""Trudy F C Mackay"", ids = ""2748801"")",98e4bee90872b0fb282e65a207e14bbde47b2cf2; c2913ce2477d2a31b759d0bec656207e5c98a0e8; 3ab31e75e993e8dfa6ec1c2402bf655c81d631fb; 213cc6e21de93515c0969d23ace60567ccd3577a; ec788646dca8b507e2ed020ab026cd9ab57a6b40; a16a44b4afbd4cab1fccc323e5b5e4d4ae8a1d98; 02f5f465c1b42b8669bb680056b29c0bd08664e4; 24ad8056b04f402872a11a6fd0feed6264ef3fe3; b9269ae30b79e0c123f5d87a21a4396cbf1a6f8a; b522d7a1b2bf59a2f427676d4bf3de75c3366db3; ba5a4f5bd78cbef0a13facbf4de360ad703cd244; 4166e7c49fede445192ee8ad5aa734baa0a0923f; 22e42d944528158c1a6fba394246bfce5fd2e85c; 84df38c0bc77976a3c5a36086f345a17aa06b82c; 1f3d63c1d4f413a55fdd6c0077edef968ea758e1; 060c2de172142dc0c38f0a4397bc0dd9d3de8080; 9d523ce2a0d055a87f3b9585218fa6e478950342; e5644b9fb0308314c174998988ab322d41a9a332; d1b968a2328d955ce370ebbe6b28082392ec9140; 63891a90b11d44ec0c9a0296d3d214adc89e41a5; 7fe238f65b97c8f997134f36f9ce436d2e0a3211; 546bb2442684fedcf368fccb9a0fb76beed5a3f4; 2c2889f0a76883c919d6a3b22022c375b0c45fdf; f2724feefd25789b02b96e34ad845df8d2b5d742; bf9388747f9f3e7f174d917741519bd40843d2c0; af8dec87d52d2722add9b9d90a9da59111f86c8c; b24dc146750a0ec64e853a726ca4100638c0e002; 7ece4ee052fe88f8f535b60c82d19a70065f91d4; 52af6949a410d4d1b607a5a698d469cd4edce45c; a5a5eb2b8426c0a02ec553e36c93258abbec397f; 5ad9feb7d30530f4a3b76ea9def7e69a0265c377; c7d009393d6f957f1a0af85df01bb53bd0e6aa46; a361df7306801f3307b117b190f8bdef7080ca42; 528c64ced447daf5730fea27d37506d50cb6dd9a; b4f10898bf9f14bbc73b994e3c059664b873b05b; fd48a72d9f9e9d865f42efa3300df131952a0aff; c102b88c89e5aa6740ba93d2f8b92b965ff90fa7; 90d08ab75d90aba2ce15bcb58203fb2e8e0e7ce9; ce6323f201b073ef1cef1a928714d55fa21aa3ab; 0663a3909c12759b36af9861edde564516f88c89; 709f4b2f42068192d090266ea3f47813b958b645; 1b544a228760bf191fe2a041cb3a64e5a4015596; 9b8b97c474a577e14abf41370162d05eac8434ad,b68efc1233c08d6d8e721dd07a9f9210eeadd615; 100b9ade43813ac7e50def35009f85a1e21909a4; a0f828d9d50122f1caa1217205b4164e27e29ef5; ffc14d94217e25c9aa31c24b6b06895e8a17ab26; 20aa595bc50e1d9a4368f52d98d77d15d26c78cc; 9aa4144bd1fc09b7682b16ea5f46857f03bc786d; bfd4c4e3a2b17f39d0c5707405adf242ca8f4b81; 181c8993e6668d0ef1143a4d70449d2ef698ef1d; 6ea27ef34e261ec90f24d807495e503ae9c83a7e; 112af0c22292c77a1a33acc3312ef2c2104dbd35; e857358b399ce2644a13ffb93e1f050acff9b93c; 8a59eaca83cfd035df5123d5380f55cb5fe6b7b3; c3f1703de64550df2207b8bc5ad3d7bff0cf7b1a; de58e35a57a7ea32177baa8782b5d7f1be765400; d90646b91904f5c4abaf4ec741882d37c912f357; d1ddfaa4b564b56ac9754c488043e88fba853597; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9512efe8dca650cc6998160a6553fb71683fa43e; 481d8d8fcc5be44e443e7bc6378a7c949ba1f9a8,Genetics,179 2,"

We employed ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to identify genes relevant to induced rabbit aneurysm biology and compare these with genes related to human intracranial aneurysms to identify genes of potential clinical interest. This included sequencing micro RNA, which are important regulatory non-coding RNA.

Materials and Methods: Elastase-induced saccular aneurysms were created at the origin of the right common carotid artery (CCA) in 5 rabbits. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) was isolated from the aneurysm and the control unoperated left CCA at 12 weeks and was processed using RNA-seq technology. The results from RNA-seq were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.

Results: 9396 genes were analyzed using RNA-seq, of which 649 (6.9%) were found to be significantly differentially expressed between aneurysm and control tissues (p < 0.05, false discovery rate 2). Of these, 500 were up-regulated in the aneurysm and 149 were down-regulated as compared to controls. Using the same criteria, 3 miRNA were identified as down regulated and 5 were identified as up regulated. Pathway analysis associated these genes with inflammatory response, cellular migration, and coagulation, among other functions and pathologies.

Conclusion: RNA-seq next-gen analysis of rabbit aneurysms shows similarities to human intracranial aneurysms with respect to regulation of some key pathways.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew D.

Benzene is an established human haematotoxin, with substantial interindividual variation in benzene-induced toxicity.


METHODS
To further examine if genetic variation contributes to benzene haematotoxicity, we analysed 1023 tagSNPs in 121 gene regions important for benzene metabolism, haematopoiesis, leukaemia and lymphoma among 250 workers exposed to benzene and 140 unexposed controls in a cross-sectional study carried out in China. Linear regression was used to analyse the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and total white blood cell (WBC) count and its subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders and occupational exposure to benzene and toluene among exposed workers. The minp test assessed the association on the gene region level. The false discovery rate method was used to control for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
VEGF (minp = 0.0030) and ERCC3 (minp = 0.0042) were the most significantly associated gene regions with altered WBC counts among benzene-exposed workers, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Highly significant changes were also found for WBC subtype counts, including granulocytes, CD4+ T cells and lymphocytes for VEGF and granulocytes and NK cells for ERCC3. Further, in workers exposed to <1 ppm, a SNP in VEGF was associated with changes in WBC and granulocyte counts, and SNPs in ERCC3 were associated with changes in WBC, NK cell and granulocyte counts.


DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that genetic variation in VEGF, which plays an important role in blood vessel growth, and ERCC3, which is a member of the DNA repair pathway and is responsible for repairing bulky DNA adducts formed by chemicals, may contribute to individual susceptibility to benzene-induced haematotoxicity at relatively low levels of benzene exposure.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Howard Dean Hosgood"", ids = ""3911249""); list(name = ""Linghui Zhang"", ids = ""13800690""); list(name = ""Manzhen Shen"", ids = ""6800794""); list(name = ""Sonja I.

879d47427518cd43d95f5bef0344961c9f0bc035,Statistical methods for differential proteomics at peptide and protein level,"Proteins are very diverse biomolecules that facilitate nearly all cellular processes of life. They interact with each other in complex networks in which disruption of a single protein can severely impact an organism. Therefore, quantitative information of a proteome (i.e. the entire set of proteins present in an organism) is extremely important to gain insights in the functioning of an organism in both healthy and diseased states. 
 
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is the method of choice for the high-throughput identification and quantification of thousands of proteins in a single analysis. When deep proteome coverage on many samples is needed, the analysis is often performed without any stable isotope labels, label-free. Here, proteins are extracted and digested into peptides that are subsequently loaded onto a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography column (HPLC) coupled to a mass spectrometer, by which they are separated, ionized and have their MS spectra recorded. The intensity peaks in these MS spectra are proxies for peptide abundance. Subsequently, (some) peptides are targeted for fragmentation and the resulting MS2 spectra enable their identification. As a result, label-free proteomics data are hierarchical: the data are at the peptide ion level, while inference typically happens at the protein level. Important to note is that signal intensities are strongly peptide-dependent as some peptides ionize more efficiently than others. Furthermore, missing values are very common and a large fraction of this missingness is not at random. Indeed, intensities of low-abundant and poorly ionizing peptides are more likely to go missing and competition for ionization makes missingness also context-dependent. 
 
Many ad hoc data analysis workflows for differential protein quantification do not handle label-free proteomics data in a statistically rigorous way, which leads to suboptimal ranking of differentially abundant proteins. Consequently, many biologically relevant proteins remain unnoticed and valuable resources are wasted by needlessly trying to validate false positive hits. 
 
In chapter 8, we demonstrate the necessity of properly taking peptide-specific effects into account in differential protein quantification analyses. Peptide-based models, which naturally account for these effects, perform better than methods that summarize peptide intensities to the protein level prior to the statistical analysis. We further illustrate that controlling the false discovery rate becomes problematic when highly-abundant proteins are differentially abundant due to suppression of the intensity of the background proteome. Finally, we show that missing values should be handled with care as imputing these under wrong assumptions leads to worse results compared to not imputing missing values at all. 
 
Most peptide-based models suffer from overfitting, unstable estimations of residual variances and a disproportionate impact of outlying peptide intensities. To address these issues, I developed the versatile R package MSqRob, which adds three modular improvements to existing peptide-based models: ridge regression stabilizes fold change estimates, empirical Bayes variance estimations stabilize the variances of the test statistics and M-estimation with Huber weights reduces the impact of outliers. MSqRobâ€™s algorithm has been described in detail in section 9.1 and it not only improves the fold change estimates in terms of precision and accuracy, but also the protein ranking, leading to a better discrimination between true and false positives. MSqRob is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRob) and has a user-friendly graphical interface that is made in ""Shiny"", an R package developed by RStudio that allows smooth integration of the R programming language with an HTML interface. 
 
In section 9.2, I pinpoint important aspects of both experimental design and data analysis. Furthermore, I provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the MSqRob graphical user interface for both simple as well as more complex experimental designs. I also provide well-documented scripts to run analyses in bash mode, enabling the integration of MSqRob in automated pipelines on cluster environments. 
 
In my latest, unpublished work (chapter 10), I focus on the missing value problem. Indeed, missingness in label-free proteomics is a mix of missingness completely at random and missingness not at random. However, the exact contributions of both mechanisms are unknown and dataset-specific, and imputing under the wrong assumptions is detrimental for the downstream protein quantifications. Therefore, I developed a hurdle model that combines the power of MSqRob with the complementary information that is available in peptide counts without having to rely on unrealistic assumptions. This enables MSqRob to quantify proteins that are completely missing in one condition in a statistically rigorous manner. Moreover, it opens new possibilities to detect the sudden appearance of post-translationally modified peptides in addition to traditional protein fold change estimation. 
 
With the development of MSqRob, I have made an important contribution to enabling experimenters to get the most out of their proteomics data. And, even though MSqRob is already one of the most versatile differential proteomics quantification tools, there are ample opportunities to broaden MSqRobâ€™s scope, both towards new types of (prote)omics data and towards more complicated experimental designs.",2019,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Ludger J E Goeminne"", ids = ""3912135"")",,,,,
36a5593d58be8285da12c06d4110c673f8dc111e,Extended likelihood approach to multiple testing with directional error control under a hidden Markov random field model,"Current multiple testing procedures are often based on assumptions of independence of observations. However, the observations in genomics and neuroimaging are correlated and ignoring such a correlation can severely distort the conclusions of a test. Moreover, most tests investigate two-sided alternatives only as a two-action problem and do not worry about directional errors. Misspecifications in signs of effects should not be regarded as power. In this study, we derive an optimal multiple testing procedure to incorporate dependence among tests, controlling directional false discovery rates. Real data examples for gene expression and neuroimaging using hidden Markov random field models show that an appropriate model is crucial for the efficiency of tests. Proper modeling of the correlation structure and model selection tools in the likelihood approach enhance the performance of a test. Reporting the estimates of various error rates is useful for the testâ€™s validity.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Donghwan Lee"", ids = ""40950489""); list(name = ""Youngjo Lee"", ids = ""2264093"")",1975f82af16251f7bab71c6c98ea4cc86fff593a; d2e94767ee303dcb9d444b583dde5ccf06028e1e,,J.

7537c8fa0d771824a314a72615207527c9a48feb,Identifying Interesting Genes with siggenes,"A common and important task in microarray experiments is the identification of genes whose expression values differ substantially between groups or conditions. Finding such differentially expressed genes requires methods that can deal with multiple testing problems in which thousands or even tens of thousands of hypotheses are tested simultaneously. Usually, a statistic appropriate for testing if the expression levels are associated with a covariate of interest and the corresponding p-value are computed for each gene. Afterwards, these raw p-values are adjusted for multiplicity such that a Type I error rate is strongly controlled at a pre-specified level of significance. The classical example of such an error rate is the family-wise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of at least one false positive. This error rate, however, might be too conservative for a situation in which thousands of hypotheses are tested and several tens of genes should be identified. In the analysis of microarray data, another error rate has, hence, become very popular: The False Discovery Rate (FDR) which is loosely spoken the expected proportion of false positives among all rejected null hypotheses, i.e. identified genes. There are, however, other ways to adjust for multiplicity: For example, QQ plots or the Bayesian framework can be employed for this purpose. If the observed test statistics are plotted against the values of the test statistics that would be expected under the null hypothesis most of the points will approximately lie on the diagonal. Those points that differ substantially from this line correspond to genes that are most likely differentially expressed. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) proposed by Tusher et al. (2001) can be used to specify what â€œdiffer substantially"" means. While Tusher et al. (2001) base their analysis on a moderated t statistic, Schwender et al. (2003) compare this approach with a SAM version based on Wilcoxon rank sums. Efron et al. (2001) use an empirical Bayes analysis (EBAM) to model the distribution of the observed test statistics as a mixture of two components, one for the differentially expressed genes, and the other for the not differentially expressed genes. Following their analysis, a gene is called differentially expressed if the corresponding posterior probability is larger than 0.9. Both SAM and EBAM are implemented in the Bioconductor package siggenes. In this article, we, however, will concentrate on SAM. In the following, we briefly describe the SAM procedure, its implementation in siggenes (for more details, see Schwender et al. (2003)), and the test statistics already available in this package. Afterwards, we show how you can write your own function for other testing situations. Finally, we will give an example of how sam can be applied to gene expression data.",2006,,"list(name = ""Holger Schwender"", ids = ""2664121""); list(name = ""Andreas Krause"", ids = ""77619309""); list(name = ""Katja Ickstadt"", ids = ""2079028"")",2a6bb6354e866b03d3073654cf154314ecca24d0; 2f6da3aa12d19c226593e9858d980a877c17a311; 5d8991fde67177e0f0624696ba2f1cc9adf4bf2a; 22938a3f30f2a7ba51ad44c2c1562e28ef615324; 63e41d3190cf4f7b719ce705fe5698d9b25854c5; 3a044614e002ed51dec9274924070cda2837f49b; 2cc5d9def426d0ac1618130e1cbe3ef186c89126; e372e9f8bd3f9e217c00d0aee222b0a5abd347a3; 862ccf4e34bcb8a7c2eeef1f5aa9996c0175d8d2; 9467375a859df790f11c5dbc28981ccbb0dff2e1; 643825ac346bdf213b501ed1ee7b5fb5764c874c; 96f6acdfee0dbc21ce49d735d7dafda820d9f501; 0a1d96377bee2fcd23aa79c6b6bd04e38bd83dcd; c649f40f3253d40dcd239f79f59610b228678e83; da7e90721d3bc627681e139474c057fa64704dbc; e8b9986e9fc75a274c382521103a7d16e11832ce; 94dacc8d7d64595eb7a720afc9abdddb46fc7b38; d86340582cf47a6c459881ddcb5e92d7942489b7; 3b6fcf8549910a54ee72d2369c14ce8ce082547c; 5c3ce1b1e203d426ec66b291f41a6eb474230ff9; 3be27176e2dee514c55e374598370928ad91f818; 58efbf9ab0c289985dc845b7de015f746f4df471; 1d426d0a8d366c3010f18963dbbba87010dbb51f,3d117cd13f7fdb3a951210c20c50388ecbf9432f; ffd3e521b609b7061942d70cf50f4e322896c67e; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; d0c6c33979f9681ed074882441ed60c5b263beec; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; d0da9ce3ca989bce2579b64be9aed518265a8994; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753,,,
e06eaeef1a68e58eecec90cc9dc2ee275269bc00,Transcriptome and apoptosis analysis of feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected crandell rees feline kidney cells,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a lethal systemic disease caused by FIP virus (FIPV), a virulent mutant of apathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). There are no effective diagnostic, vaccine and treatment available 
because the virus virulence determinants and pathogenesis are not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the early host genes and the phenomenon of apoptosis associated with in vitro infection of FIPV in cell culture. RNA samples from FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 infected Crandell Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells at 3 hours post infection were sequenced using Illuminaâ„¢ next generation sequencer platform then subsequently analysed with CLC bio Genome Workbench software. Sequencing reads were mapped to Felis catus 2X annotated shotgun reference genome and 
control versus infected cell reads expression analysis was conducted. Kalâ€™s Z test on expression proportions was used to determine significantly expressed genes. Genes expressed with false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 and 
more than 1.99 fold change were considered for further analysis. RNA-seq analysis mapped both control and infected cell reads to 18899 genes out of 19046 annotated, while expression analysis revealed 61 genes were differentially expressed by both samples with 44 genes were up regulated 
while the rest were down-regulated. Among the genes is a chemokine for attracting monocytes, CCL8 that was expressed only in infected sample suggesting that early response against FIPV involves cell mediated immunity 
(CMI). In addition, 4 genes (CXCL10, PHF11, ATF3, IRF1) that associated with Th1 cytokines secretion were also up regulated in this study. Meanwhile, anti-apoptotic gene RNF7 and ribosomal gene RPL39 were expressed only in control sample indicating that FIPV initiate apoptosis and 
disturb host cell protein translation as early as 3 hours after infection. Besides that, 9 pro-apoptotic genes (CXCL10, MX1, RSAD2, UBA7, RNF19B, ESE1,BAK1, CASP7, PD-L1) were up regulated while another 3 anti-apoptotic genes (c-Kit, CKS2, ID-1) were down regulated. The detail role of those genes and other differentially expressed genes are discussed. The ability of the virus to induce apoptosis in CRFK cells was also analysed within 48 hours at 12 different time frames which are 3, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 36, 42 and 48 hours by flow cytometry and annexin-V FITC staining. Apoptosis analysis confirmed that a significant number of cells undergo early apoptosis 18 
hours post-infection and late-apoptosis 30 hours post-infection. This study has succesfully identified several candidate genes that may play important role in FIPV pathogenesis and has characterized important events in cell 
death following FIPV infection in CRFK cells.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Mohammad Syamsul Reza Harun"", ids = ""5306892"")",,,,,

Here, we introduced a novel secretory and acid glycoprotein with cysteine rich (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, SPARC), which is correlated with the worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) and prognosis of OSCC. SPARC expression levels were measured in OSCC tissues and normal tissues using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The influence of SPARC on cell proliferation was examined by cell counting kit-8, colony formation, and Edu tests. Then, the effect of SPARC on the metastasis of OSCC cells was detected by wound healing and transwell migration assays. Next, the biologic characteristics of SPARC shared by STRING were analyzed. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms were confirmed by western blot analysis. SPARC revealed higher expression in OSCC tissues than nontumor tissues. Higher SPARC expression was correlated with poorer tumor differentiation, poorer WPOI pattern, and significantly and shorter overall survival. Knockdown SPARC significantly restrained OSCC cell growth, migration, and invasion. In addition, bioinformatics analysis found SPARC had a coexpression network with the platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways with minimal false discovery rate. Furthermore, SPARC promotes OSCC cells metastasis by regulating the expressions of PDGFB, PDGFRÎ², p-PDGFRÎ² , and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Higher SPARC expression was positively correlated with poor WPOI and differentiation in OSCC. SPARC activates the PI3K/AKT/PDGFB/PDGFRÎ² axis to promote proliferation and metastasis by OSCC cell lines.

5f433586db6c69ab1654ea08bc2aceb8542aae40,Beyond Bonferroni: less conservative analyses for conservation genetics,"Studies in conservation genetics often attempt to determine genetic differentiation between two or more temporally or geographically distinct sample collections. Pairwise p-values from Fisherâ€™s exact tests or contingency Chi-square tests are commonly reported with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. While the Bonferroni correction controls the experiment-wise Î±, this correction is very conservative and results in greatly diminished power to detect differentiation among pairs of sample collections. An alternative is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) that provides increased power, but this method only maintains experiment-wise Î± when none of the pairwise comparisons are significant. Recent modifications to the FDR method provide a moderate approach to determining significance level. Simulations reveal that critical values of multiple comparison tests with both the Bonferroni method and a modified FDR method approach a minimum asymptote very near zero as the number of tests gets large, but the Bonferroni method approaches zero much more rapidly than the modified FDR method. I compared pairwise significance from three published studies using three critical values corresponding to Bonferroni, FDR, and modified FDR methods. Results suggest that the modified FDR method may provide the most biologically important critical value for evaluating significance of population differentiation in conservation genetics.â£Ultimately, more thorough reporting of statistical significance is needed to allow interpretation of biological significance of genetic differentiation among populations.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Shawn R Narum"", ids = ""5679740"")",ad2356f2a145596f8ca787e6f9f5b4e27ba1543a;

f9d1c587d6dec7ec6a1bbd2b85cc9d55b1f55a4c,Statistical Analysis of High-Dimensional Genetic Data in Complex Traits,"With the recent development of high-throughput DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing techniques for detecting various genomic variants (SNVs, CNVs, INDELs, etc.), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become a popular strategy to discover genetic factors affecting common complex diseases. Many GWASs have successfully identified genetic risk factors associated with common diseases and have achieved substantial success in unveiling genomic regions responsible for the various aspects of phenotypes. 
 
However, identifying the underlying mechanism of disease susceptible loci has proven to be difficult due to the complex genetic architecture of common diseases. The previously associated variants through GWASs only explain a small portion of the genetic factors in complex diseases. This rather limited finding is partly ascribed to the lack of intensive analysis on undiscovered genetic determinants such as rare variants and gene-gene interactions. Unfortunately, standard methods used to test for association with single common genetic variants are underpowered for detection of rare variants and genetic interactions. 
 
This special issue is dedicated to presenting state-of-the-art statistical and computational methods for finding missing heritability underlying complex traits with massive genetic data including GWAS, next-generation sequencing, and DNA microarray data. The main focus of this special issue is on data mining and machine learning for advanced GWAS analysis. The advanced GWAS analysis includes multi-SNP analysis, gene-gene and gene-environment interaction analysis, estimation of missing heritability, and analysis of population heterogeneity. This special issue provides a platform to the researchers with expertise in data mining to discuss recent advancements in analytic approach of post-GWAS association analysis in field of statistics and bioinformatics. 
 
The paper by W. Lee et al. proposes an approach to identifying clinically interesting subgroups in a heterogeneous population. The identification step uses a clustering algorithm and proposes an improved false discovery rate- (FDR-) based measure to remedy the overestimation of the ordinary FDR-based approach. The paper by Y. Kim et al. performs heritability estimation by using population- and family-based samples. The main idea lies in utilizing genetic relationship matrix to parameterize the variance of a polygenic effect for population-based samples. 
 
Three other papers consider gene-gene and gene-environment analysis. First, J. Yee et al. proposed interaction analysis for quantitative traits using entropy. Although there have been several methods proposed for gene-gene interaction using entropy, this is a robust entropy-based gene-gene interaction analysis that does not necessarily require an assumption on the distribution of trait for quantitative traits. Second, S. Y. Lee et al. focused on identifying multi-SNP effects or gene-gene interactions for survival phenotypes. In the framework of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method, several extensions for the survival phenotype are considered and compared to the earlier MDR method through comprehensive simulation studies. Third, the paper by H. Xu et al. proposes a new GWAS strategy for detecting gene-gene and gene-environment analysis by combining the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction-graphics processing unit (GMDR-GPU) algorithm with mixed linear model approach. It was further employed to investigate the genetic architecture of important quality traits in rice. The reliability and efficiency of the model and analytical methods were verified through Monte Carlo simulations. 
 
The next two papers discuss multi-SNP analysis. Y. J. Yoo et al. propose a new multi-bin linear combination (MLC) test for multiple SNP analysis. It first performs clustering analysis to find cliques, complete subnetworks of SNPs with all pairwise correlations above a threshold, and then performs MLC test. Through simulation studies, the clique-based algorithm was shown to produce smaller clusters with stronger positive correlation than other MLC tests. The paper by S. Won et al. focuses on comparing penalized and nonpenalized methods for disease prediction with large-scale genetic data. It was shown that penalized regressions are usually robust and provide better accuracy than nonpenalized methods for disease prediction. 
 
Next, the work of J. Joo et al. considers robust genetic association tests for GWAS. How these robust tests can be applied to the replication study of GWAS and how the overall statistical significance can be evaluated using the combined test formed by p values of the discovery and replication studies were demonstrated. 
 
Finally, the paper by L. Li and M. Xiong proposes a dynamic model for RNA-seq data analysis. To extract biologically useful transcription process from the RNA-seq data, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) model was proposed for modeling the RNA-seq data. Differential principal analysis was developed for estimation of location-varying coefficients of the ODE. 
 
This special issue discusses the most challenging issues in multiple SNPs approaches including gene-gene interaction and introduces statistical and computational methods for data mining and machine learning for revealing hidden association network of genotype-phenotype relationship. The nine papers in this special issue provide scientists with an overview on the recent advancements in multiple SNP analysis for GWASs. We hope the papers can encourage researchers towards a more extensive use of statistical genetics and bioinformatics techniques for research in biology and medical sciences.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Taesung Park"", ids = ""145599603""); list(name = ""Kristel Van Steen"", ids = ""50563565""); list(name = ""Xiang-yang Lou"", ids = ""49588303""); list(name = ""Momiao Xiong"", ids = ""48037380"")",,,BioMed Research International,2015,
5c7a31c0c56d20ea0c5434f8356f47783944e122,Screening and functional pathway analysis of genes associated with pediatric allergic asthma using a DNA microarray,"The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with pediatric allergic asthma, and to analyze the functional pathways of the selected target genes, in order to explore the pathogenesis of the disease. The GSE18965 gene expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and was preprocessed. This gene expression profile consisted of seven normal samples and nine samples from patients with pediatric allergic asthma. The DEGs between the normal and pediatric allergic asthma samples were screened using limma package in R, and the cutâ€‘off value was set at false discovery rate <0.05 and log fold change >1. Following hierarchical clustering of the DEGs based on the expression profiles, the upâ€‘ and downregulated genes underwent a functional enrichment analysis by topological approach (P<0.05), using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A total of 127 DEGs were identified between the normal and pediatric allergic asthma samples. The upâ€‘ and downregulated genes were significantly enriched in the actin filamentâ€‘based process and the monosaccharide metabolic process, respectively. Seven downregulated DEGs (M6PR, TPP1, GLB1, NEU1, ACP2, LAMP1 and HGSNAT) were identified in the lysosomal pathway, with P=6.4x10(â€‘9). These results suggested that variation in lysosomal function, triggered by the seven downregulated genes, may lead to aberrant functioning of the T lymphocytes, resulting in asthma. Further research regarding the treatment of pediatric allergic asthma through targeting lysosomal function is required.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Li-Qun Lu"", ids = ""50706985""); list(name = ""Wei Liao"", ids = ""145381129"")",f946c3719f0e416deb0d3422accbcf83b7105d98; f468dd7802ffe273862a6f7a0a4f59cda5174258; d3833967cd35b2f13616574fb32c419a2fb09f52; 73c2fe6a217272e025c1316b44d7363e13566dae; 821a861e856461e3debc16e378eeece532ad1415,ff5bfa390473aa1b84f1072f518b871a1b7f76b4; e5ba538944747a6b2ba2a59213268ca2f8df5456; 7e31865a37061b5e9890ee4e3d08d122cb6dc667; 37c7476bb285e52ee2c9300f6823d5962feae3c4; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 37e9862c6837933610268b8e9f5ea28f4f0ee11c; 84f5c269fcf13322183f89a77cf2783f0f9fddf5; dfa2727c776fc5b8dcd4d9217e4564e578ddb5a5; dc6731a84c55d85d6448ed0a4ed7c72833a489d6; f02678e30c865e02d741bc70b92fc74f298ce003; 73d6f1d3d63b5edbee2f76ba2f6583c1ded80f21; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; d1cb499bd71fe427e9ee5bce16362736971d6570; 6282088ff7711a8e6df17260969d7a1f03edc803; 6fb2a3e7a025fa2288c7fdf970f5201b50ada31e; 5761d19b8a5d00a0e5bdaa880f512ecfd0e9494a; c4bc07e73bfd2ff3e2635d85a7ffd5f4096c1587; 1f7831916e4f5e67c2a29e8d48d0ab9d5eee6277; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0644a46d9ae742cd746484c8efcc02c2cfddddaf; 0672783af05e31d8b77f00906169ef1cca779147; 91576b20616bf549fbf6c4279d3b1432d9683c22; d55763cb83260544f98c4c965577eecc65ee7c47; 3da127dfc8d8479c7d6ffc2b4f037ca25c8dc639; 47b936c93187cb2b852d47f082ba4add05e8bc21; 934e3de2e9141b8ea659ffac1c225677b8a92403; 75ef75d44ef3765aa384fb272041a0bd951ba468; 847d65caea3a5bcbb3ca8e8d8e2c81d67a4387cc; 9576801aa52d59002ff522edaa4b9977a7b52217; 0c740a527e6102f93c0f6f2d3e8893753aea322a; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 5d6aa71ab6c5b4e7cc6538b15dc34e41aea68c23; 55b0f23baa46993d0e36e31a53f74f41d8413a03; d78ed32acbdc1a0e83c5137a2c9b5c9866af8f99; d3dffdce9252dffa56abd2ac3b0667aa3b1bd478; a8cf9cc1769c3d5857954abc9f8ad361b6dff8e5; 9940ed188822c05d07fcb3108524f2729fc30c63; e3cc57b3a71b8d8d2ad3353652d0094b985d7490,Molecular Medicine Reports,11,4197 - 4203

In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence of gene expression and determine a `strength of evidence' measure for gene equivalence. It is common practice in genome-wide studies to rank genes according to observed gene-specific P-values or adjusted P-values, which are assumed to measure the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis of no differential gene expression. We show here, both empirically and formally, that the equivalence P-value does not satisfy the basic consistency requirements for a valid strength of evidence measure for equivalence. This means that the widely-used q-value (Storey, 2002) defined for each gene to be the minimum positive false discovery rate that would result in the inclusion of the corresponding P-value in the discovery set, cannot be translated to the equivalence testing framework. However, when represented as a posterior probability, we find that the q-value does satisfy some basic consistency requirements needed to be a credible measure of evidence for equivalence. We propose a simple estimate for the q-value from posterior probabilities of equivalence, and analyse data from a mouse stem cell microarray experiment which demonstrate the theory and methods presented here.",2012,Mathematics; Biology,"list(name = ""Jonathan Tuke"", ids = ""115693779""); list(name = ""Gary F.

970eecd043f78124c2fbc541e33b81b3340fe8a0,Does thinner right entorhinal cortex underlie genetic liability to cannabis use?,"BACKGROUND
Although alterations in medial temporal lobe structures have been previously associated with use of cannabis, one of the most widely used illicit drugs, whether such alterations are a cause or effect of cannabis use has been unclear.


METHODS
In this cross-sectional observational study involving 404 twins/siblings, we have compared cortical thickness and surface area between groups of gender-matched sibling-pairs (concordant cannabis unexposed, concordant exposed and discordant for cannabis exposure) using permutation tests after controlling for potential confounds. Bi-variate polygenic model was used to assess the genetic and environmental contributions underlying cortical morphological phenotypes and frequency of cannabis use.


RESULTS
Cortical thickness of the right entorhinal cortex was significantly lower in the concordant exposed siblings compared to both discordant unexposed and discordant exposed groups [false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected, q < 0.05]. The association between the right entorhinal cortex thickness and frequency of cannabis use is due to the contribution of significant shared additive genetic (Ïg = -0.19 Â± 0.08; p = 0.02) factors but not unique environment (Ïe = 0.05 Â± 0.09; p = 0.53). Significantly lower surface area of the right entorhinal cortex in discordant exposed group compared with the discordant unexposed group furnishes preliminary evidence in support of causal effect of cannabis use (FDR-corrected, q < 0.05). However, bi-variate polygenic model-based analysis did not show any significant effect.


CONCLUSIONS
Shared genetic liability may underlie the association between cannabis exposure and thinner right entorhinal cortex. Prospective longitudinal studies are necessary to definitively disentangle the cause-effect relationships of cannabis use.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Subhadip Paul"", ids = ""46594555""); list(name = ""Sagnik Bhattacharyya"", ids = ""3255035"")",abaaf934ff012d8faa02c4fc4ce885ec8d67c7fe; a1c9f739970baa597aabd823748ac1059815365a; 6b113dee2e1d16b8970254ce086faa737cac7d17; 47e490913d27c811b4f5decc2650c5941abfec16,74f0227f851b88aa2a2e7194856e42be145ae5cb; f35a0d67e910f6e398c32e7d6bf8aa3d46d35d3b; 81c3798b992cb609aa58946d58663c0b2863b351; b13c24a27cbb8ac941e59838fb7ceae8aa72857f; 0d2738522cc106e0c21d4415c5b23248c84ba988; b673df6fae5d1b48c506a5d469ceecc28adcb3fc,Psychological medicine,48 16,"

dd4bcd358db5d04c7a3c72b18fc5c01d5103c3cb,Oral administration of oat beta-glucan preparations of different molecular weight results in regulation of genes connected with immune response in peripheral blood of rats with LPS-induced enteritis,"PurposeBeta-glucans are biologically active polysaccharides having antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antiinflammatory properties. This study investigated the transcriptomic profile in peripheral blood of rats with LPS-induced enteritis, which wereÂ fed a diet supplemented with high- (G1) and low- (G2) molecular-weight oat beta-glucans.MethodsTwo-color rat gene expression microarrays were applied and the analysis was performed using a common reference design to provide easy means of comparing samples from various experimental conditions against one another. Common reference sample was labeled with cyanine 3 (Cy3) and investigated samples from each experimental group: C-G0 (control group fed semi-synthetic diet), LPS-G0 (LPS-challenged group fed semi-synthetic diet), LPS-G1 (LPS-challenged group fed G1 beta-glucan enriched diet), and LPS-G2 (LPS-challenged group fed G2 beta-glucan enriched diet) were labeled with cyanine 5 (Cy5). Each microarray was performed in quadruplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s HSD post-hoc test (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). A multiple testing correction was performed using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rateâ€‰<â€‰5%. A quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to verify the expression of chosen transcripts.ResultsThe microarray analyses revealed differentially expressed transcripts between: the LPS-G0 and the control groups:Â C-G0 (138 genes), the LPS-G1 and LPS-G0 groups (533 genes), and the LPS-G2 and LPS-G0 groups (97 genes). Several differentially expressed genes in the beta-glucan-supplemented groups encoded proteins belonging to TLR and NLR signaling pathways, as well as prostaglandin synthesis and regulation pathways. Both beta-glucans up-regulated the expression of Atg10, which belongs to the family of autophagy-related genes, suggesting a possible link between autophagy induction and beta-glucan supplementation.ConclusionThe changes in gene expression observed in the peripheral blood indicate that oat beta-glucans exerted a protective effect in rats with an induced inflammatory state caused by LPS challenge. The greater number of differentially expressed genes was observed in group supplemented with G1 beta-glucan, pointing at the differences in the mode of action of high- and low-molecular-weight beta-glucans in the organism.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katarzyna BÅ‚aszczyk"", ids = ""1432702774""); list(name = ""MaÅ‚gorzata Gajewska"", ids = ""144371509""); list(name = ""Jacek Wilczak"", ids = ""122671932""); list(name = ""Dariusz Kamola"", ids = ""5906563""); list(name = ""Alicja Majewska"", ids = ""46407191""); list(name = ""Joanna Harasym"", ids = ""15567614""); list(name = ""Joanna Gromadzka-Ostrowska"", ids = ""1397981991"")",e95a28512933a739d79485088416d2097f6bff75,56625a4fa80f20b45f4961fd7ed053f8ba84a9af; 74685a77818341ae1fecf4f852e52e0004db2826; 0e02cd68a89c886542a0de6d40f58e7878ab798b; 020f8fd4c7d1519025e367632d436091d6fcf8f8; 11ac6ceccea69246174b5e84e0a27cc1dfc962aa; cad0cabe152d1cbedd74b347597ed862ab052935; 0bb6bec1a70dc59839b6485064d9d93a970bf2b4; 7af85e0e56ed26a451e65b17712c649447b066f5; 5956f58b9b340846cf82e1c745e6b639ad295851; d564d6ff6ea91ab90a715c03f99a38ec9f46bf95; 7a2629a97aafddd645c4633fa7c835ff0d3bc44a; a6eaeaf82cd1fabb945b976633f087b7b091947e; c55c1800524b9d09dfdb529a3f4a9bddcf853651; f86b942b1256171bd9a9e4261c05406d9b6d9f12; 628b6c21b1dbde9ff8a5d2320e4fa45ac5b9826b; a0595364bf977647db00f4fbbf056680316c798b; 069c531e00040b4fed7dc2b42488519f5d059c4f; ef709cb240d3d7477145ba1cb09a150c9cc9d9b5; ec04d5667b06ab38fcfc86d26da7b65f0e480ae1; ff727b9215475538caa664fd5787e428d0ed1ac6; bd7ff9265d709a62f4d332d133945ca0887d35ec; dbf7858b96b1de81fcaf2bac3e98774673a2891a; 802dc18413f8466d4e14c2dcf4bda6aeaddc24ae; 20305acf44b22c07e7f8dc52b57cf36ae0b6e6d2; 3e39e5db5d34c1f790987be9696f27119754033c; c321fcbb2bacbb6a88afc23a343188d75b752fb3; 60773a546a728cb5f7258d266222c81a44282f05; 16d4ba9cc1d46d452a40ba7faae870a1c4a36cc0; 8f0f912a42514071eb2665d5d11d5d9cc66b1b47; 8799c7f871bb42e27fac7510739b52409d91245f; 1e1cb2e6e1a8aa39f2df29ee4e0963524217d385; fbefb883c83bdf7aa4cf3e52475d344adc901913; 8273b3722b0ff90ad02cd0bb692e400d281163dd; bece6134999ca14b6caed796a1a76d08d9e23b4a; 2489ead86ec198107be4ebbf3150d61664dfefc4; 63b8e5ea1af47ab218d6b9ff0cd197bda7bafa96; b305e29a0504de13b051491942646002dc625478; aa78657ef48fb36748e643f56fdde5854b757d90; 31b5dacf7d27d418fbdc94e38b79a7cf21c8fb31; 63ac2e6d69934f13f2c6da601764b74252cc0724; 791e410d88d214de1545c46b9ab006a9c1e4560f; a3ffbb0a6dac970e84e844c35b4800eb73105a2d; c796c45b78328a743b229a65885468b98223a0d2; 003111aa3f4c2141d0edcc7233e4e5ed2d776e76; eb71ddceab575db9036fca5269875329af9783b5; 482afc7e9ccf2d5cd4c8c1bb62fddb3f6047d520; bb73e71f5dc80b44ed1e5532e28c4923341c978e; bfaaa442f3247f872bba83a3d09a4d7d88e7cb62; 5cec2469f99b781d4cfe37d9d7f6a43450b302a1; 7f1517ca036b7b93dba9bff7e15e112b2e8ab23f; 4a9e7a40396a0e50b2d1879d83e69f69db8461f4; be088021d764de0a52d0d09c42f20fb2ffdeb2cd; 9f2611abb084dafc5e3a2b2e31901687deed1bcf; 70b60153f1fbd4578d7de9b61be3825f0d71a170; b9bba974c1667e9cbc80af35d082c04b298c7e2f; e32ad6586854e69af86fd3250f7c3091957fdc3d; ab61b63fb947fdcee4448d060c7e752c593b61da; d0e003020d17d766bff0b022aa532d18939206e8; bacdeefbf748a8b4666d0558cab1a3b6529c2399; fc1681f848f36e4a3a5bd3db38afef5def4866ce; 1122c135e72ae25d060a1e9dcfb498aa98466197; 211565fb7ea0ad8e1ce1c9f69c6e40a4ae1fa2f7; b7cdc048dfed5634a7b25aa62ab16149a9e80eb8,European Journal of Nutrition,58,2859 - 2873
8b7cf5b5cef954161baecd0ad3c7445fe89c7c9c,Empirical Bayes Estimation of a Sparse Vector of Gene Expression Changes,"Gene microarray technology is often used to compare the expression of thousand of genes in two different cell lines. Typically, one does not expect measurable changes in transcription amounts for a large number of genes; furthermore, the noise level of array experiments is rather high in relation to the available number of replicates. For the purpose of statistical analysis, inference on the ``population'' difference in expression for genes across the two cell lines is often cast in the framework of hypothesis testing, with the null hypothesis being no change in expression. Given that thousands of genes are investigated at the same time, this requires some multiple comparison correction procedure to be in place. We argue that hypothesis testing, with its emphasis on type I error and family analogues, may not address the exploratory nature of most microarray experiments. We instead propose viewing the problem as one of estimation of a vector known to have a large number of zero components. In a Bayesian framework, we describe the prior knowledge on expression changes using mixture priors that incorporate a mass at zero, and we choose a loss function that favors the selection of sparse solutions.

At present, accurate diagnosis is only possible after the third week of pregnancy. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as diagnostic biomarkers for numerous human conditions such as cancer and diabetes. Moreover, distinct circulating miRNA profiles have been associated with different stages of human pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine whether differential miRNA profiles occur in circulation during early pregnancy (Day 24 or earlier) in cattle that could be used for diagnostic purposes. Holstein-cross heifers were oestrous-synchronised and artificially inseminated (AI, nâ€‰=â€‰11) or sham-inseminated (control, nâ€‰=â€‰8) at first detected oestrus. Plasma samples were collected on Days 0, 8, 16 and 24 after insemination. Circulating miRNA levels were independently determined in pooled plasma samples (nâ€‰=â€‰3 pools for each of pregnant Day 24 and nonpregnant Days 0, 8, and 16) using Qiagen qPCR arrays (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and in individual samples (nâ€‰=â€‰11 samples for each pregnant Days 16 and 24, and 8 samples for each of nonpregnant Days 0, 8, and 16, respectively) using Illumina miRNA sequencing. The qPCR array data were analysed using the Î”Î”Cq method. The miRNA sequencing data were normalised using EdgeR. Differential expression between pregnant and nonpregnant groups was determined using 2-sample t-tests with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment. Differences in miRNA expression were validated by RT-qPCR. Out of a total of 191 miRNAs analysed in pooled samples using qPCR arrays, 8 were differentially expressed ( 0.1) between nonpregnant time-points. Changes in levels of 11 miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR in individual plasma samples; although expression trends for these miRNAs were the same as in pooled samples, none of the changes in individual samples were significant after FDR adjustment (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.1). Deep sequencing (96 million miRNA reads) identified 231 miRNAs in bovine plasma. There were no significant differences (FDR >0.1) in the expression of any miRNAs between pregnant heifers (Days 16 or 24) and nonpregnant (Days 0, 8, and 16 individually or combined). In addition, no significant differences were identified among nonpregnant time-points. In summary, we successfully performed miRNA profiling of bovine plasma using both deep sequencing and qPCR; however, we did not detect differences in miRNA expression between early pregnant (Day 16 or 24) and nonpregnant heifers. Changes in circulating miRNA levels may involve low abundance miRNAs that cannot be accurately quantified using current technology. Alternatively, changes in circulating miRNA levels may only occur later during pregnancy in cattle.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""John P. A.

6fe464886ec72b9e738ca87fb72b4cb7aa68d5c4,Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Differentially Expressed Genes and Pathways for Oviduct Development and Defense in Prelaying and Laying Hens.,"PROBLEM
The oviduct plays an indispensable role in the formation of eggs, especially the magnum and uterus. The identification of oviduct development in different stages will help to target candidate genes and pathways in regulation of albumen and eggshell formation, as well as defense mechanism in oviduct and egg.


METHODS
To identify the function differences and the molecular defense mechanism of the oviduct and egg, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis of the magnum and uterus in 120d and 300d old Lohmann layers, three birds in each group.


RESULTS
With fold changes (log2 Ratio)â‰¥2 and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01, RNA-Seq revealed 1040 genes expressed differentially in the magnum and 595 genes in the uterus. By combining GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, it served to show that genes activities of the magnum and uterus in prelaying chickens were more likely to concentrate on growth and development, and after egg-laying, they were mainly inclined to enhance the substances transmembrane transport and secretion activities. We further characterized 1579 new genes, while only 803 of them were functionally annotated. A complex mixture of proteins related to defense was measured in this study. A subset of avian Î²-defensins (AvBDs) and ovodefensins (OvoDs), that is, AvBD12, AvBD11, AvBD10, OvoDA1, OvoDB1, OvoDA2, OvoDA3 and OvoDBÎ² were detected to express in the magnum of laying hens at high levels.


CONCLUSION
Collectively, the identification and functional analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), as well as specific expression of avian defensins may contribute to understand the development and defense mechanisms of oviduct and eggs.

The main aim of our study was to assess how energy deprivation (i.e., ""semi-starvation"") leading to substantial fat mass loss affects the immune system and immunosuppression in previously normal weight individuals. Thus, to address this hypothesis, we applied a high-throughput systems biology approach to better characterize potential key pathways associated with immune system modulation during intensive weight loss and subsequent weight regain. We examined 42 healthy female physique athletes (age 27.5 Â± 4.0 years, body mass index 23.4 Â± 1.7 kg/m2) volunteered into either a diet group (n = 25) or a control group (n = 17). For the diet group, the energy intake was reduced and exercise levels were increased to induce loss of fat mass that was subsequently regained during a recovery period. The control group was instructed to maintain their typical lifestyle, exercise levels, and energy intake at a constant level. For quantification of systems biology markers, fasting blood samples were drawn at three time points: baseline (PRE), at the end of the weight loss period (MID 21.1 Â± 3.1 weeks after PRE), and at the end of the weight regain period (POST 18.4 Â± 2.9 weeks after MID). In contrast to the control group, the diet group showed significant (false discovery rate <0.05) alteration of all measured immune function parameters-white blood cells (WBCs), immunoglobulin G glycome, leukocyte transcriptome, and cytokine profile. Integrative omics suggested effects on multiple levels of immune system as dysregulated hematopoiesis, suppressed immune cell proliferation, attenuated systemic inflammation, and loss of immune cell function by reduced antibody and chemokine secretion was implied after intense weight loss. During the weight regain period, the majority of the measured immune system parameters returned back to the baseline. In summary, this study elucidated a number of molecular pathways presumably explaining immunosuppression in individuals going through prolonged periods of intense training with low-energy availability. Our findings also reinforce the perception that the way in which weight loss is achieved (i.e., dietary restriction, exercise, or both) has a distinct effect on how the immune system is modulated.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Heikki V.

87d9e7126952d6ceadfe09695d4e5590442741d4,Microarray analysis reveals differentially expressed lncRNAs in benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovaries,"Recent studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in many types of human malignant cancers. However, the function of lncRNAs in benign tumors remains poorly understood. In the present study, to explored the potential roles of lncRNAs in benign epithelial ovarian cysts (BEOCs) which commonly occur in young women and possess malignant potential, we described the expression profile of the lncRNAs between BEOC and normal ovarian tissues using lncRNA microarray techniques. The results showed that 1,325Â transcripts of lncRNAs (1,014Â upregulated and 311Â downregulated) were differentially expressed in the BEOCs compared with the normal controls [absolute fold-changeÂ â‰¥2, false discovery rate (FDR)Â <0.05]. We also conducted quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to confirm the microarray data. The results of qPCR revealed that the expression trend of 6Â randomly selected lncRNAs was consistent with the microarray data.

af9c4df7e88ee81b4c5be156fae6199351fe9fca,A nonparametric approach for relevance determination,"The objective of many high throughput studies is to identify factors that are relevant to an outcome of interest. Such studies are abundant in genetics, image processing, astrophysics, and neuroscience. In this paper, we argue that treating these problems as large-scale hypothesis tests does not reflect the motivation behind the studies. Instead, we suggest treating these studies as a decision problem, where our primary concern is selecting the most relevant set of factors for a more focused follow up. Furthermore, instead of dividing the factors into a significant and a non-significant group (which is common in the hypothesis testing framework), we propose a flexible Bayesian model that accommodates subgroups with different degrees of importance. To this end, our approach uses a simple extension of Dirichlet process mixtures to model the relationship between the factors and the outcome. With simulated data, we demonstrate that our model performs substantially better than alternative methods based on the false discovery rate. We also apply our method to two real large-scale studies. The objective of the first study is to interrogate the mutation status of p53 in cancer cell lines, and the objective of the second study is to identify differentially expressed genes between two types of leukemia. Overall, we find that taking into account the true motivation behind high throughput studies and the possible complexity of relationships between factors and outcome could improve the analysis by increasing the rate of discovering relevant factors while keeping the false discovery rate low.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Babak Shahbaba"", ids = ""2642138"")",15c9f9fb790300dc312d64dc0021457fd2233cec,,arXiv: Methodology,,

This study examines the association between global DNA methylation and IR using 84 monozygotic twin pairs. IR was estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Global DNA methylation of Alu repeats in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The association between global DNA methylation and IR was examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and within-twin pair analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. Results show that methylation levels at all four CpG sites were individually associated with IR by GEE (all false discovery rate-adjusted P valuesâ‰¤0.026). A 10% increase in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.55 units (95% CI 2.38-6.73) in HOMA. Intrapair difference in IR was significantly associated with intrapair difference in global methylation level. A 10% increase in the difference in mean Alu methylation was associated with an increase of 4.54 units (0.34-8.71; P=0.036) in the difference in HOMA. Confirmation of the results by intrapair analyses suggests that genetic factors do not confound the association between global DNA methylation and IR.

cc53e988ffe4052b5e9dfc104beedb982cca4971,Amplified Expression Profiling of Platelet Transcriptome Reveals Global Activation of Arginine Metabolic Pathways in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease.,"In sickle cell disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury and intravascular hemolysis produce endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) and arginine bioavailability. Recent functional studies of platelets in patients with sickle cell disease reveal a basally activated state, suggesting that pathological platelet activation may contribute to sickle cell disease vasculopathy. Studies were therefore undertaken to globally examine transcriptional signaling pathways in platelets that may be dysregulated in sickle cell disease. We demonstrate and validate here the feasibility of comparative platelet transcriptome studies on clinical samples from single donors, by the application of RNA amplification followed by microarray-based analysis of 54,000 probe sets. Data mining for platelet specific or abundant genes identified 118 genes that showed more than a 100-fold increase in transcript expression level compared to all other cells in the database. Most of these genes were clearly annotated as platelet-specific and 84% of these transcripts overlapped with the platelet abundant genes identified in previous gene expression studies. On comparing the platelet gene expression profiles in 18 patients with sickle cell disease in steady state to 12 African American controls, at a 3-fold cut-off and 5% false discovery rate, we identified >100 differentially expressed genes, including multiple genes involved in arginine/NO metabolism and redox homeostasis. Further functional characterization of these pathways using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, real time PCR, arginase enzymatic assay, and polyamine quantification revealed arginase II-mediated catabolism and diversion of arginine from NO signaling and polyamine synthesis to proline formation. These studies suggest a potential pathogenic role for platelet arginase and ornithine decarboxylase antizyme and provide a novel framework for the study of disease-specific platelet biology.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Nalini Raghavachari"", ids = ""4166361""); list(name = ""Xiuli Xu"", ids = ""47158847""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Villagra"", ids = ""33039059""); list(name = ""Greg J.

d4baf5cf490a5e8c3e2392b94cf01f4ec7c9c855,S135 Circulating metabolites in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary vascular occlusion,"Introduction Recent studies have demonstrated that metabolomic profiling can identify metabolites and pathways which may have importance in the pathobiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the plasma metabolome in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and chronic thromboembolic vascular occlusions without pulmonary hypertension (CTED) has not been well characterised. Objective To profile circulating metabolites in CTEPH and CTED and assess metabolite gradients across the pulmonary circulation. Methods In the patient group, multisite blood sampling was performed at the time of right heart catheterisation. Blood samples were collected from the superior vena cava, pulmonary artery and radial artery. Venous blood samples from patients were compared to healthy controls to identify the metabolites present and to assess the difference between health and disease. Additionally, in the disease group, transpulmonary gradients were assessed by analysis of fold change in metabolite concentration between paired samples from the pulmonary artery and radial artery. Untargeted, semi-quantitative metabolic profiling of plasma was performed using the Metabolon DiscoveryHD4â„¢ platform (Metabolon, NC, USA), utilising 2 ultra-high performance liquid chromatography methods, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used to compare metabolites between disease and control, with false discovery rate correction for multiple testing. Results The disease group included patients with a spectrum of chronic pulmonary vascular occlusions (Table 1). A total of 1375 metabolites were detected in 70 venous plasma samples analysed from 43 patients and 27 healthy controls. Amongst endogenous metabolites, 266 showed a significant difference between disease and control. In the disease group there were increases in acylcarnitine metabolites, long chain fatty acids, polyamines, glycogen metabolites and primary bile acid metabolites compared to healthy controls. There was a reduction in lysolipids, plasmalogens, aminosugars, branched chain amino acid metabolites, glutathione metabolites and a number of steroids (Table 1). Analysis of transpulmonary gradients revealed primarily a reduction in metabolite concentration across the pulmonary circulation. This included depletion of energy substrates, lysolipids, lysoplasmalogens and acylcholines. Conclusions This pilot study of circulating metabolites in patients with CTEPH, CTED and healthy controls reveals differences between health and disease in several biological pathways. Measurement of the transpulmonary gradient of metabolites indicated predominant clearance of circulating metabolites associated with energy metabolism and cell turnover. These findings require confirmation in a larger population.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kasia Zalewska"", ids = ""82600719""); list(name = ""Emilia M.

To explore the neuroanatomical correlates of advanced PA/MA, the current study conducted brain morphometric analyses in 39 high-functioning adult males with ASD and 39 age-, intellectual level-, and parental socioeconomic background-matched, typically developed (TD) males. Whole-brain analysis revealed that the regional gray matter volume (GMV) in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus (PCU) were significantly smaller in the individuals with ASD than in TD subjects (false discovery rate-corrected P = 0.014). Additional analyses of the constituents of GMV reduction in these brain regions revealed that the cortical thickness of the right ventral PCC was significantly thinner (P = 0.014) and the surface area of bilateral PCU was significantly smaller (left: P = 0.001; right: P = 0.049) in the adults with ASD, compared with TD subjects.

9400ac38a840d61af4b32b7a7c3492cd022d6a1a,42 Effects of Trichostatin a Treatment on Gene Expression of Cloned Mouse 2-cell and Blastocyst Stage Embryos,"Trichostatin A (TSA) is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases and has been shown to improve cloned embryo pre-implantation and term development. We examined the effects of TSA treatment on cloned mouse embryonic gene expression using microarrays. Cloned mouse embryos were generated using long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) and terminally differentiated granulocytes (Gr-1) as nuclear donors, which have been shown to have significantly different cloning efficiencies (Sung et al. 2006 Nat. Gen. 38, 1323â€“1328). Late 2-cell and blastocyst stage cloned embryos and control, BDF1 in vivo and IVF embryos (nâ€‰=â€‰10 from each embryo type and stage, except LT-HSC blastocysts, where nâ€‰=â€‰5) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from individual embryos and amplified using the TargetAmp 2 round Aminoallyl aRNA amplification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA). Amplified RNA from each embryo and a standard reference was labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 and hybridized to the mouse exonic evidence based oligonucleotide (MEEBO) microarray allowing for the interrogation of ~25â€‰000 genes. After Loess normalization, ANOVA with false discovery rate (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) was used to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes. A subset of the DE genes was verified by RT-qPCR. These two cell types drastically differed in their potential to give rise to morula/blastocyst stage embryos: LT-HSC: 4.1% v. Gr-1: 38.9%. When treated with 10 nM TSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10â€‰h immediately after activation, the morula/blastocyst rate increased to 66.1% for the LT-HSC cloned embryos and to 69.3% for the Gr-1 cloned embryos. At the 2-cell stage, we identified 2172 DE genes between the TSA-treated and untreated LT-HSC embryos. There were 512 DE genes between the Gr-1 and Gr-1 TSA embryos. Interestingly, the cloned embryos were more similar to the in vivo and IVF embryos after TSA treatment at the 2-cell stage, as evidenced by hierarchical clustering and the reduced number of DE genes: LT-HSC v. in vivoâ€‰=â€‰2622 genes; LT-HSC TSA v. in vivoâ€‰=â€‰473; Gr-1 v. in vivoâ€‰=â€‰1448; Gr-1 TSA v. in vivoâ€‰=â€‰312. By the blastocyst stage, the effect of TSA was considerably less pronounced with 18 and 17 DE genes between the LT-HSC/TSA and Gr-1/TSA embryos, respectively. These data indicate that TSA treatment normalizes 2-cell cloned embryo gene expression, enabling significantly more embryos to develop to the blastocyst stage. Our findings demonstrate that TSA exerted the greatest effect on the LT-HSC embryos, which were the most difficult to reprogram by SCNT.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Sadie L.

Male circumcision (MC) confers partial protection to men against HIV and, in research settings, some sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is also associated with protection from some STIs among female partners. However, real-world data on changes in STI transmission associated with large-scale public African medical male circumcision (MMC) conducted for HIV prevention are lacking and would improve estimates of the health impact of MMC.


Methods
The HIV Incidence Provincial Surveillance System is a community-based surveillance platform for HIV prevalence, incidence and intervention coverage trends in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. HIPPS collected cross-sectional self-reported data on circumcision status (from men), partner circumcision status for past three partners (from women) and demographic characteristics and behavioural risk factors; and tested participants for HIV, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, hepatitis B, N eisseria gonorrhoeae, C hlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed on associations between own (men) or partner's (women) circumcision status and each STI. Multivariable analyses adjusted for age, demographic characteristics and behavioural risk factors, and incorporated false discovery rate (FDR) correction.


Results
Among men, MMC had a protective association with HSV-2 (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.86), hepatitis B (OR 0.53, 95%â€‰CI 0.30 to 0.95), HIV (OR 0.50, 95%â€‰CI 0.38 to 0.65) and M. genitalium (OR 0.53, 95%â€‰CI 0.32 to 0.88). Among women, partner circumcision had a protective association with HSV-2 (OR 0.71, 95%â€‰CI 0.53 to 0.95) and HIV (OR 0.66, 95%â€‰CI 0.49 to 0.90). Associations with HIV and HSV-2 remained significant for men and all women after FDR correction.


Conclusion
These real-world data, supporting protective associations between MMC conducted for HIV prevention and STIs in men and women, can help clarify the full impact of MMC and support a role in broader sexual health programming.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephanie M.

However, various statistical studies of the daily number of births along the Moon cycle, mostly on rather short periods (from 40 to 60 lunar cycles, i.e. less than 5 years), conclude to contradictory results, which strengthens the need for a powerful analysis on a large amount of data. We propose a large-scale signiflcance testing analysis of the full Moon efiect in each lunar cycles from 1968 until 2005 based on the daily numbers of births in France. A multiple testing methodology (see [13] and [7]) which accounts for dependence among lunar cycles is used to guarantee both a high overall power and a control of the False Discovery Rate at a low level. Results conflrm the existence of a small yet marked full Moon efiect: on average, one cycle per year shows a signiflcantly larger birth rate during a 6-days period around the Full moon day than the other days of the cycle, which is four times more than for a comparison between any other 6-days period and the rest of the cycle.",2009,Geography,"list(name = ""A.

A population of 110 Iberian (25%)Â Ã—Â Landrace (75%) back-crossed pigs was used, because these two breeds exhibit extreme profiles of intramuscular saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents. Total RNA from Lt muscle was individually hybridized to GeneChip Porcine Genome arrays (Affymetrix). A principal component analysis was performed with data from the 110 animals to select 40 extreme animals based on the total fatty acid profile and the MUFA composition (MAP). Comparison of global transcription levels between extreme fatty acid profile pigs (nÂ =Â 40) resulted in 219 differentially expressed probes (false discovery rate <0.10). Gene ontology, pathway and network analysis indicated that animals with higher percentages of PUFA exhibit a shift toward a more oxidative muscular metabolism state, with a raise in mitochondria function (PPARGC1A, ATF2), fatty acid uptake and oxidation (FABP5, MGLL). On the other hand, 87 probes were differentially expressed between MUFA composition groups (nÂ =Â 40; false discovery rate <0.10). In particular, muscles rich in n-7 MUFA expressed higher levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism (GLUL, CRAT, PLA2G15) and lower levels of fatty acid elongation genes (ELOVL5). Moreover, the chromosomal position of FABP5, PAQR3, MGLL, PPARGC1A, GLUL and ELOVL5 co-localized with very relevant QTL for fat deposition and composition described in the same resource population.

Accurate EMR-based cohort identification is crucial in the conduct of comparative effectiveness research. CheCS is a longitudinal study of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC) infection being conducted at 4 HMORN sites. Subjects are identified using automated EMR-based ICD-9 diagnosis and laboratory inclusion criteria, and about 12,000 patients were identified in the initial cohort selection. After confirmation of CHB/ CHC status through chart abstraction, we found false discovery rates (FDR) were 13.6% for CHB and 11.3% for CHC. An adaptive approach was proposed to optimize the EMR-based cohort selection.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mei Lu"", ids = ""145110123""); list(name = ""Jia Li"", ids = ""49298260""); list(name = ""Lora B.

Even though the main inspiration of this work comes from biological applications, where the data is extremely high dimensional and often hard to obtain, the developed methods are applicable to any general statistical learning problem. 
In this work, the various machine learning tasks like hypothesis testing, classification, regression, etc are formulated as risk minimization algorithms. This allows such learning tasks to be viewed as optimization problems, which can be solved using first order optimization techniques in case of large data scenarios, while one could use faster converging second order techniques for small to moderately sized data sets. Further, such a formulation allows us to estimate the first order convergence rates of an empirical risk estimator for any arbitrary learning problem, using techniques from large deviation theory. 
In many scientific applications, robust discovery of factors affecting an outcome or a phe- notype, is more important than the accuracy of predictions. Hence, it is essential to find an appropriate approach to regularize an under-determined estimation problem and thereby control the generalization error. In this work, the use of local probability of false discovery is explored as such a regularization parameter, which forces the optimized solution towards functions with a lower probability to be a false discovery. Again, techniques from large devi- ation theory and the Gibbs principle allow the derivation of an appropriately regularized cost function. 
These two theoretical results are then used to develop concrete applications. First, the problem of multi-classification is analyzed, which classifies a sample from an arbitrary proba- bility measure into a finite number of categories, based on a given training data set. A general risk functional is derived, which can be used to learn Bayes optimal classifiers controlling the false discovery rate. 
Secondly, the problem of model selection in the regression context is considered, aiming to select a subset of given regressors which explains most of the observed variation i.e. perform ANOVA. Again, using techniques mentioned above, a risk function is derived which when optimized, controls the rate of false discoveries. This technique is shown to outperform the popular LASSO algorithm, which can be proven to not control the FDR, but only the FWER. 
Finally, the problem of inferring under-sampled and partially observed non-negative dis- crete random variables is addressed, which has applications to analyzing RNA sequencing data. By assuming infinite divisibility of the underlying random variable, its characterization as being a discrete Compound Poisson Measure (DCP), is derived. This allows construction of a non-parametric Bayesian model of DCPs with a Pitman-Yor Mixture process prior, which is shown to allow for consistent inference under Kullback-Liebler and Renyi divergences even in the under-sampled regime.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Arijit Das"", ids = ""47295567"")",4c9ea66f0fdfef118661f713d51c8d01ec5342be,2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 1169c41c174fcf00bec37b238ce0741fdec120c6; 7c116d119a1281749616665cbab70e348de19d3b; 7ecee5281f1f7c5d17125cf86426c39307bce5fd; c2fa58268f73d336ee35775809c04dc9d8f3e9e0; 961eabeaebd7035cd7668c9917fa9c39462e1113; 125ccd810f43f1cba83c6681836d000f83d1886d; a5296405ab04e1bb93ac43059814851e8186d70d; b6eef4f87ade0929d9bfc1c7890732d5838634a4; aa6a49bc2201ef773a565736fb140d2eff48fe95; 4526dd12ae002e047c1fcafb3ecb70c4bc60670e; 1078c2a805d538dbc5f7a0d3522f243ec2d306b4; 181dfa593c11bd54b6bd5a0ff569720d8623ab66; e66079381f006c03e80e790f8c3d7e72eaa50436; b3c22857095db1df0609975df3359c873ddfaf35; 184ac0766262312ba76bbdece4e7ffad0aa8180b; 947feba9136e877f50968b62fd2e6c6381376580; 375f4ee81d36dc162f1f16d99a7b29318d6305f4; fbcb62a2c9f3f06c62dea5eab209aa5e83e2fbd1; 1f74ea475359a19919c7993b322ef3b883267a9e; 9850cc6b66e9d2d3cda43b7529ef270ebee1329f; daea71d981d47455bbc500f1d922504e7e6e1c1d; 9a700c7a7e7468e436f00c34551fbe3e0f70e42f; b5c504b1383170939a1b122e400a906332fe0423; 35da0a2001eea88486a5de677ab97868c93d0824; 18a397bed6c8c5725046c3d89249efac5a0767cc; 9e21624c98058cbc29fb952a5d4d0c134d23de51; 491df9456415437e75004a5b98574bb086cc01a5; 80b41013f4b608fc4d9f010269ec407fa2018a71; 7f19bd0301e3eabe23737baee2382d2f4f13ad46; 2540b36616761e6fde519eed00aef8f0e5e412a0; 395dd01c0d24777c660cf195c4cfadcdf51fb7e8; 0880b89d9a837af1e0b4f2d5ed43e26f3ae77da8; a1af03813bfe3b1043f848c5c7155486127ed7b3; f2f192cf5412ad21b193a25b417413ec88e45234; ae168294e6013ebf2af13cc6c4a825096f827a6c; b2f291da09728f5438da84e9b76a54bbf8b9da91; f36fa844a095e7b03b5adb5b18ecc6e437cfcfc6; 0f7c85357c366b314b5b55c400869a62fd23372c; 7a9b9857eab95db5818889e857e356379bc9f603; df0402517a7338ae28bc54acaac400de6b456a46; 019164a41ce68106e6fae2bb63c80ae07d7103ab; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 4894805f9d7bdb3ce39797ff483357613faddf1f; b4ef47ed4677c58c32adb2f07cd72042a6824106; 6a97d2668187965743d1b825b306defccbabbb4c; cec8412a03aa42778ef0f4daf61c5c8c81ac9cb1; ec682fab6196e3802facc1b52ce88250766b167c; 4e2f6b4bc889eed1afe5833d5190f6f02e501061; 6b52c398b130786a556d0dcc495a7d27df7f7048; 796226fc480bf9eb1764a29fda00949e91e8d096; b33110d93b5c9eb3232fd57883e98b2cb51594aa; 098474bb8c481e062d9693ec61ba41a216abfc21; 8552f9c17b6c36db1d8d55bfb9e0732a104ceeed; b8a487a16a2173014aa9eea91c1c02bf76c954ae; 12a8bbb1aa0fd745bbad00298e82009df069c59d; 90c10cc419420e18ed8649967c2cf3ae45c42057; 92f8c75b64fcf9dfc350c6269b1ac58cbaa009ee; 641165c959554d8f03314778bd6dfb581d9a469e; 6a190681168aded29453b9701a22009af1b1a366; 2cd8e8f510c89c7c18268e8ad51c061e459ad321; 36e00caa724a4f8865b6f675fa27f7297e51ba41; 23effc082f2582b39e277dfc99bbce198cf36451; f69476a1a62517c77457fec7a29f1292a4607685; 0054eb42d8ad63b1988fe32df6284762619dcada; 4b86774638131c144f6afa72cd1f1867798dd99c; fe697b4e2cb4c132da39aed8b8266a0e6113f9f2; a549bed132e669b3f581df1ac029f4a09115dc3f; 5b61faef42861e1bb312df892d89b44cbacfc9d6; 5f277cf472e86d2fa3710077534ee8d2ef6d585e; b7ba2fd63f6b0152630b59b8194948676f6c51d6; 4f17ed8edb6a203c622b7255e35af1eba1e074aa; 3ec0923b39f2842b162ef30823c49b4d0040c3b8; c0e18badb0c58c06edad6946af38a2e7ffee2075; 430de87a0a8996bc93b1998f9a6261f7558a5679; a180f6f7d61ed18ebe50c0c12889bdb826508130; 4609f6bdc3beab00c9beceaa12dd8101fefe6f1c; 7118264c8f38f0b45a497defc716e392ca673236; 4f8a87535794576043803de919cbcd955cdc92f6; 5e706a090b154018caeb33b48c21df4d902a6079; ac222f6a84431d307d7b9af05ad75f8aac5cbed0; e1bc410718d8aee83d87aec93619d12655ac2857; 8388f1be26329fa45e5807e968a641ce170ea078; 7fbb0fcfc6f39457784c0543ed7303dc8e294f37; 118f4f5aa858470831302a559ae684daec6308f1; cf3a256340d4ac33e7ba5461ecc4889c1d5ba8f1; e92a5defa8249b52908c5565fd21434a654c4c7e; cc384cff27d8a609f89f9e915c26bf31c39749a1; 26ceb1a387f78447bd0baf584e9921cd5359935b; 5b238e057930222ce4e492bd2a55d4ad65d2810f; 8b7b9d4439849256c1841f39ff6a38ad93d66a94; 003e586edfa3101af83abb21c694f89aef007b7a; abbbbb325037052e9a0983c40d43792b6cc61163; ffdcad14d2f6a12f607b59f88da4a939f4821691; 2a941e7c5f374f8f8dba0daf6ffc6504a2779473; 019198dd0e3f53a34a7c3f8502a1a0e435a3cb26; 79c78c98ea317ba8cdf25a9783ef4b8a7552db75; 571b0750085ae3d939525e62af510ee2cee9d5ea; 4ca234e88d853a77e1b91672d23080aa62f8e7e2; b7fa6ab03090501f1ff24ec4603ac8368ed3e83a; c9a3547914d9711aeafdc020774f0808d3969213; ee7778874a4ff13edc60ff37a7c3c0964173e0e8; 8315dff3d304baf47c025f4b33535b9d693350c1; 415229903f91a1f3fc7404f5e5997fde025c221d; eaf299fa4016a70a24a685dbc757b8320dd30e73; c3a7fa3a1cc2a432e92c03c1c936ea2fff54a63d; 32de44f01a96d4473d21099d15e25bc2b9f08e2f,,,

Background: Passively collected data from consumer wearable devices (CWD) presents an opportunity to capture patient-relevant outcomes in everyday life. However, clinical relevance and applicability remains to be further explored, as research using CWD data to characterize MS patients in everyday life is lacking. Design/Methods: From medical claims of a large national insurer, we identified 9,015 individuals with MS and 18,030 age, sex and geography matched controls without MS. Of these, 498 (5.5%) MS and 1,473 (8.2%) non-MS individuals also had wearable devices data that they shared as part of a wellbeing program in which they participated. Several daily summaries of step and sleep data recorded at minute-level granularity were computed and combined with claims and demographic data over one year. Statistical tests for between-group comparisons were controlled for false discovery rate (FDR) which was set at Results: Compared to non-MS, MS patients had a lower percentage of days in which they recorded steps (73% vs 77%, p-val Conclusions: Mobility and sleep endpoints computed from CWD significantly differ between MS and non-MS patients.

5d0c108da6fd2dae43574599ff1f9cb3f388c255,Improved peptide identification for proteomic analysis based on comprehensive characterization of electron transfer dissociation spectra.,"In recent years, electron transfer dissociation (ETD) has enjoyed widespread applications from sequencing of peptides with or without post-translational modifications to top-down analysis of intact proteins. However, peptide identification rates from ETD spectra compare poorly with those from collision induced dissociation (CID) spectra, especially for doubly charged precursors. This is in part due to an insufficient understanding of the characteristics of ETD and consequently a failure of database search engines to make use of the rich information contained in the ETD spectra. In this study, we statistically characterized ETD fragmentation patterns from a collection of 461â€‰440 spectra and subsequently implemented our findings into pFind, a database search engine developed earlier for CID data. From ETD spectra of doubly charged precursors, pFind 2.1 identified 63-122% more unique peptides than Mascot 2.2 under the same 1% false discovery rate. For higher charged peptides as well as phosphopeptides, pFind 2.1 also consistently obtained more identifications. Of the features built into pFind 2.1, the following two greatly enhanced its performance: (1) refined automatic detection and removal of high-intensity peaks belonging to the precursor, charge-reduced precursor, or related neutral loss species, whose presence often set spectral matching askew; (2) a thorough consideration of hydrogen-rearranged fragment ions such as z + H and c - H for peptide precursors of different charge states. Our study has revealed that different charge states of precursors result in different hydrogen rearrangement patterns. For a fragment ion, its propensity of gaining or losing a hydrogen depends on (1) the ion type (c or z) and (2) the size of the fragment relative to the precursor, and both dependencies are affected by (3) the charge state of the precursor. In addition, we discovered ETD characteristics that are unique for certain types of amino acids (AAs), such as a prominent neutral loss of SCH(2)CONH(2) (90.0014 Da) from z ions with a carbamidomethylated cysteine at the N-terminus and a neutral loss of histidine side chain C(4)N(2)H(5) (81.0453 Da) from precursor ions containing histidine. The comprehensive list of ETD characteristics summarized in this paper should be valuable for automated database search, de novo peptide sequencing, and manual spectral validation.",2010,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rui-Xiang Sun"", ids = ""8631626""); list(name = ""Meng-Qiu Dong"", ids = ""35527954""); list(name = ""Chun-qing Song"", ids = ""5261093""); list(name = ""Hao Chi"", ids = ""47762217""); list(name = ""Bing Yang"", ids = ""145218305""); list(name = ""Li-Yun Xiu"", ids = ""33097304""); list(name = ""Longbin Tao"", ids = ""95577141""); list(name = ""Zhiyi Jing"", ids = ""5118947""); list(name = ""Chengjun Liu"", ids = ""103201250""); list(name = ""Le-Heng Wang"", ids = ""8657320""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""115452338""); list(name = ""Si-Min He"", ids = ""50309371"")",95536d3ce7f082d3c53fa05a96320101ab0039a2; fd7c281f478bba68e0c47281e9fbabd0e585fce1; a02ebeecce520d63e697e8252c3e47bd41130cee; 2ed64ddd3338a40680f0eebfd2340a98575116e1; 10641e6d8611daac35e4b5e09deb405b132602d8; 5c1dae76e1bb8ab00d8ff0645c7fe885505a5ff8; 6becc5fa2d3e0bb06ea730cc6c25e73ea7fe227f; 6e5791ceef162179082c7c024eb486406e99204e; 29d2042e47aa741e837f215818edfe9f4b665712; 15de32e68f250442f012e47b8bc8b082f3ddf430; 0276686b24498c0bd50239203ab873b284e9c4e3; 16e43173e1bc1ab585eedd779abfaec977a125d1; d1b1d657a76b1353a3bcc0af6f06dcc7aaf92cc9; b4ef57425bec6a45b5339bef3582a25f58a81ea3; 0b51f501df0c06a0d491e49d684f0e79f6ad65f7; 5da1f01c0aff9294538eed07278433f0c0dc9c09; 80f91c5ca6795263b2dcf84c1b697999ef721761,ad7e432b2d47e8755923c9297104793dd5781bee; e94c1eb713c7aba560bf0b2d31f091a33859b893; 61b25bd68677b0dbb0e85d22b5961a2b0643c5b5; 42ba2eab39183277d4de47fe8083169abe3bb02a; cfd9b357126e9edf075cef1c19abeee432465a38; 70ebaa087efcf176e4589f176625ce72379754fd; 62f88297d700158f08151db04b7b9a74e222a2b6; ee398e70c5435d91e9413614a4e193e29db9598d; d5e625ef03ef0c52d493be255a35fc64738c4192; 0283c1dc41ffa3ad88db5c4b4ab25613cd096e3c; 9bd71270bb9f05cd9d11659dd45ea0b5c7794950; f1bdeece116deca3220cbc44214491d5af1046bb; ddc39a62e9f20114bf45f92c4860980ca2facf3d; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 9802b6a6c7bd165d7ef58261f9e485156c4024ae; 18e5c56eba7470ddea9268bd35176beecd2e986a; 32554dc1b87294709d0a0ab00921a2b7ef8e9a03; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 327c6417e69319de13e41aa24892aa6f49320ed5; de04f7fda8032666803bc406d9c257e6bff47da7; 63b2fb088a0d231d3334c625407a8d436c1c730c; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 165fe96247bd2c2daa79c67efc9316700afa5c4a; dd580358da6acfadb47fe85f5bbcc619d8959210; 905eb26ea90993dec18be04859f331ca15217a6d; 4faf258f65e11937d7ef8c15e0674bc5b56309bf; 4bd866c42e6e22602f0d9cae24d5a8d0e1c58990; 1802d45babacd34bd3ea9aa91f35cef3af33870a; bc8c09b2e65bfee4090ab8c03449228695b2114b; f916f5095fb5f6688353b06f3a6eb74ddd094c8f; 4997092dac187e76b9dd20f701157319d1fe4f9f; ea5fa015df28f572ebfe21af5e187f2510729b7f; 127c89eb50f9cb3d6422a30caf211cee60086fca; 8db70652fe7e8f453a013f8298004718822d8931; af01e0b6b6c8e822e48e7e6a93fe14ffd56b30ed; 936a8cc748f8978c2799d3ea919759912657d5f6; 93f07cfd4d79c08e78cf61a94c260434fb69293b; 1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; ce309778173ba7da443cbd8a6da171051ab3d556; 24da700b15126e051321da4a58fc507fe036c5fb; 8c9e4b2d1660484a406febe81b6b8585dbc29c61; eddc094667af4da7b3698c26230b0b1fbbe08448; 0a2229a3407251a4abe89d8d15667e30f752deb3; 8ac27463c3a26b30c4aa81a961775be86471be55; 967cbcd13503f6eadf7c684be69b47df6a5054e0; 4a3421a6941cbfbaa3b7f69424434ec15b3d956a; e7efccfabb3f21c9836c9be8ba397e547a01b078; b118848d7e287239c5aecb53b026a457e2ce212b; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 0c77fc71a364f8fbed9dc761fec34162a8795258; dd79b7c18edffa3c737a7090b96b73bfc6adc2c1; d6e708153e1093ddd52f60f2b11099481d612a38; 77d5c4202c19f214a6b9526466eb74ef884412e2; bb0f293aabcc2a4fe7f84b6717ab854fdb151d1d; ebb85be6201bf3ed7ab93d3053efc1b339e86d32; f28a484b9af1dfca4b98218000b405145658c76d; 933adfe007afd5aaa84362a79470f186d76a3abd,Journal of proteome research,9 12,"

352fddfd33f0a005f51fd73e3f4332afd516225b,Combining a molecular profile with a clinical and pathological profile: biostatistical considerations.,"The use of molecular markers and gene expression profiling provides a promising approach for improving the predictive accuracy of current prognostic indices for predicting which patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer will progress to muscle-invasive disease. There are many statistical pitfalls in establishing the benefit of a multigene expression classifier during its development. First, there are issues related to the identification of the individual genes and the false discovery rate, the instability of the genes identified and their combination into a classifier. Secondly, the classifier should be validated, preferably on an independent data set, to show its reproducibility. Next, it is necessary to show that adding the classifier to an existing model based on the most important clinical and pathological factors improves the predictive accuracy of the model. This cannot be determined based on the classifier's hazard ratio or p-value in a multivariate model, but should be assessed based on an improvement in statistics such as the area under the curve and the concordance index. Finally, nomograms are superior to stage and risk group classifications for predicting outcome, but the model predicting the outcome must be well calibrated. It is important for investigators to be aware of these pitfalls in order to develop statistically valid classifiers that will truly improve our ability to predict a patient's risk of progression.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard J.

7b4861b7b601c6507e8cecb0ec8f72ff8e0ddaaa,The maternal plasma proteome changes as a function of gestational age in normal pregnancy: a longitudinal study,"OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy is accompanied by dramatic physiological changes in maternal plasma proteins. Characterization of the maternal plasma proteome in normal pregnancy is an essential step for understanding changes to predict pregnancy outcome. The objective of this study was to describe maternal plasma proteins that change in abundance with advancing gestational age and determine biological processes that are perturbed in normal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal study included 43 normal pregnancies that had a term delivery of an infant who was appropriate for gestational age without maternal or neonatal complications. For each pregnancy, 3 to 6 maternal plasma samples (median, 5) were profiled to measure the abundance of 1125 proteins using multiplex assays. Linear mixedâ€effects models with polynomial splines were used to model protein abundance as a function of gestational age, and the significance of the association was inferred via likelihood ratio tests. Proteins considered to be significantly changed were defined as having the following: (1) >1.5â€fold change between 8 and 40 weeks of gestation; and (2) a false discovery rateâ€“adjusted value of P < .1. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was used to identify biological processes overrepresented among the proteins that changed with advancing gestation. RESULTS: The following results were found: (1) Ten percent (112 of 1125) of the profiled proteins changed in abundance as a function of gestational age; (2) of the 1125 proteins analyzed, glypicanâ€3, sialic acidâ€binding immunoglobulinâ€type lectinâ€6, placental growth factor, Câ€C motifâ€28, carbonic anhydrase 6, prolactin, interleukinâ€1 receptor 4, dualâ€specificity mitogenâ€activated protein kinase 4, and pregnancyâ€associated plasma proteinâ€A had more than a 5â€fold change in abundance across gestation (these 9 proteins are known to be involved in a wide range of both physiological and pathological processes, such as growth regulation, embryogenesis, angiogenesis immunoregulation, inflammation etc); and (3) biological processes associated with protein changes in normal pregnancy included defense response, defense response to bacteria, proteolysis, and leukocyte migration (false discovery rate, 10%). CONCLUSION: The plasma proteome of normal pregnancy demonstrates dramatic changes in both the magnitude of changes and the fraction of the proteins involved. Such information is important to understand the physiology of pregnancy and the development of biomarkers to differentiate normal vs abnormal pregnancy and determine the response to interventions.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roberto Romero"", ids = ""145783429""); list(name = ""Offer Erez"", ids = ""6858231""); list(name = ""Eli Maymon"", ids = ""1839390""); list(name = ""Piya Chaemsaithong"", ids = ""6809143""); list(name = ""Zhonghui Xu"", ids = ""39951828""); list(name = ""Percy N Pacora"", ids = ""6054579""); list(name = ""Tinnakorn Chaiworapongsa"", ids = ""3985187""); list(name = ""Bogdan Done"", ids = ""1832526""); list(name = ""Sonia S.

9b26ee78424a751f721b9787cb03fc2d4acccf98,"Differential Gene Expression in Colon Tissue Associated With Diet, Lifestyle, and Related Oxidative Stress","Several diet and lifestyle factors may impact health by influencing oxidative stress levels. We hypothesize that level of cigarette smoking, alcohol, anti-inflammatory drugs, and diet alter gene expression. We analyzed RNA-seq data from 144 colon cancer patients who had information on recent cigarette smoking, recent alcohol consumption, diet, and recent aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use. Using a false discovery rate of 0.1, we evaluated gene differential expression between high and low levels of exposure using DESeq2. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to determine networks associated with de-regulated genes in our data. We identified 46 deregulated genes associated with recent cigarette use; these genes enriched causal networks regulated by TEK and MAP2K3. Different differentially expressed genes were associated with type of alcohol intake; five genes were associated with total alcohol, six were associated with beer intake, six were associated with wine intake, and four were associated with liquor consumption. Recent use of aspirin and/or ibuprofen was associated with differential expression of TMC06, ST8SIA4, and STEAP3 while a summary oxidative balance score (OBS) was associated with SYCP3, HDX, and NRG4 (all up-regulated with greater oxidative balance). Of the dietary antioxidants and carotenoids evaluated only intake of beta carotene (1 gene), Lutein/Zeaxanthine (5 genes), and Vitamin E (4 genes) were associated with differential gene expression. There were similarities in biological function of de-regulated genes associated with various dietary and lifestyle factors. Our data support the hypothesis that diet and lifestyle factors associated with oxidative stress can alter gene expression. However genes altered were unique to type of alcohol and type of antioxidant. Because of potential differences in associations observed between platforms these findings need replication in other populations.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martha L.

Methods: Bone marrow samples at relapse from 57 patients enrolled on Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group (COG) protocol, AALL01P2, for treatment of first marrow relapse were obtained. Paired samples from initial diagnosis for 10 of these patients were retrieved from COG cell banks. Total RNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix U133-A microarrays. Data was normalized by Robust Multichip Analysis and Genetraffic software was used for unsupervised analysis. Differentially expressed genes were identified by SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays). Results: As timing of relapse is the most important predictor of outcome, we identified 156 genes with significant differences in expression between early ( = 36 months from diagnosis) relapse.

28cc0b0e0c404b59383e64858b4d93c7ea35f618,Genome-wide profiling of bone reveals differentially methylated regions in osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.,"OBJECTIVE
To determine genome-wide methylation profiles of bone from patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and those with osteoporotic (OP) hip fractures.


METHODS
Trabecular bone pieces were obtained from the central part of the femoral head of 27 patients with hip fractures and 26 patients with hip OA. DNA was isolated, and methylation was explored with Illumina methylation arrays. RNA was extracted, pooled, and deep-sequenced to obtain the whole transcriptome. Differentially methylated regions were identified, and connections between genes with differentially methylated regions were explored by pathway and text-mining analyses.


RESULTS
After quality control, methylation of 23,367 CpG sites (13,463 genes) was analyzed. There was a genome-wide inverse relationship between methylation and gene expression in both patient groups. Comparison of OP and OA bones revealed 241 CpG sites, located in 228 genes, with significant differences in methylation (false discovery rate<0.05). Of them, 217 were less methylated in OP than in OA. The absolute methylation differences were >5% in 128 CpG sites and >10% in 45 CpG sites. The differentially methylated genes were enriched for association with bone traits in the genome-wide association study catalog. Pathway analysis and text-mining analysis with Gene Relationships Across Implicated Loci software revealed enrichment in genes participating in glycoprotein metabolism or cell differentiation, and particularly in the homeobox superfamily of transcription factors.


CONCLUSION
Genome-wide methylation profiling of bone samples revealed differentially methylated regions in OP and OA. These regions were enriched in genes associated with cell differentiation and skeletal embryogenesis, such as those in the homeobox superfamily, suggesting the existence of a developmental component in the predisposition to these disorders.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""JesÃºs Delgado-Calle"", ids = ""1398821988""); list(name = ""Agustin F.

4157c9521987458f37c4868f673279a12ac9c85d,Gene reprogramming in exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy in swine: A transcriptional genomics approach.,"Cardiac hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV) in response to dynamic exercise-training (EX) is a beneficial adaptation to increased workload, and is thought to result from genetic reprogramming. We aimed to determine which transcription factors (TFs) are involved in this genetic reprogramming of the LV in swine induced by exercise-training. Swine underwent 3-6 weeks of dynamic EX, resulting in a 16% increase of LV weight/body weight ratio compared to sedentary animals (P=0.03). Hemodynamic analysis showed an increased stroke volume index (stroke volume/body weight +35%; P=0.02). Microarray-analysis of LV tissue identified 339 upregulated and 408 downregulated genes (false discovery rate<0.05). Of the human homologues of the differentially expressed genes, promoter regions were searched for TF consensus binding sites (TFBSs). For upregulated and downregulated genes, 17 and 24 TFBSs were overrepresented by >1.5-fold (P<0.01), respectively. In DNA-binding assays, using LV nuclear protein extracts and protein/DNA array, signal intensity changes >2-fold were observed for 23 TF-specific DNA probes. Matching results in TFBS and protein/DNA array analyses were obtained for transcription factors YY1 (Yin Yang 1), PAX6 (paired box 6) and GR (glucocorticoid receptor). Notably, PAX6 and GR show lower signals in TFBS and protein/DNA array analyses upon exercise-training, whereas we previously showed higher signals for these factors in the remodeled LV of swine post-myocardial infarction (MI). In conclusion, we have identified transcription factors that may drive the genetic reprogramming underlying exercise-training induced LV hypertrophy in swine. PAX6 and GR are among the transcription factors that are oppositely regulated in LV hypertrophy after exercise-training and MI.

f61fb2b8fb6809756e2b4a980a87aa035d0f036d,Abstract 4325: Cisplatin treatment of testicular cancer introduces long-term changes to the epigenome,"Testicular cancer (TC) survival rates have increased substantially over the last decades, largely due to the introduction of cisplatin (CP) chemotherapy. This treatment is, however, associated with increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome (MetS), defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. We aimed to investigate if CP treatment were associated with epigenetic changes, and whether these changes render TC survivors susceptible for developing MetS later in life. We included 279 Norwegian TC survivors with and without CP treatment and MetS, matched on age at blood sampling (Table 1). The TC survivors were re-examined on average 16 years after the orchiectomy, and for some patients, CP treatment. Whole genome DNA methylation profiles were measured with MethylationEPIC BeadChip and analyzed with the R package minfi. We used a linear regression model adjusting for smoking, age and cell type composition to identify CP differentially methylated CpG sites and logistic regression adjusting for smoking and age to identify differentially methylated CpG sites associated with MetS. Gene enrichment analyses were based on Fisher9s exact test using KEGG and Reactome pathways. 32 and 15 differentially methylated CpG sites were associated with CP treatment after adjusting for multiple testing with False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Bonferroni correction, respectively. The PTK6-RAS-MAPk pathway was significantly enriched with the FDR significant CpGs (p-value In conclusion, our results suggest that CP treatment has long-term effects on the epigenome. Genes involved in double-strand break repair, consistent with the cytotoxicity of CP treatment, are among the differentially methylated CpGs. Our top list of differentially methylated CpGs associated with MetS (lowest unadjusted p-values), should be further explored in a larger sample set of TC survivors. Citation Format: Trine B.

87f9a22f40db842b30273e10132ea0b5957aea61,A quantitative proteomic analysis of FFPE melanoma.,"To the Editor, 
 
Currently, melanoma is diagnosed based on microscopic features, and some of these attributes, including tumor thickness, ulceration, mitotic index, and extent of lymph node involvement, have prognostic significance (1). Patients with melanoma detected at an early stage undergo surgery to remove the primary tumor, but some patients progress to advanced stage disease despite treatment (2). Thus, there is a major need for the identification of prognostic biomarkers of melanoma. Unfortunately, biomarker studies using frozen tissue from primary human tumors are problematic, due to the inherent instability and tissue heterogeneity of the samples. In contrast, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue is very stable and can be coupled with laser microdissection for targeted sample isolation. However, harvesting enough cells and extracting the cross-linked proteins has been challenging. 
 
We describe an approach that successfully extracts sufficient amounts of protein from FFPE tissue for mass spectrometric analysis and for free quantification of identified proteins. Similar approaches have proven successful for the analysis of other FFPE samples (3,4,5). Our approach is the first described for the comprehensive analysis of melanoma and melanocytic nevi using a coupled method with gel electrophoresis and spectral counting. For this proof-of-principle analysis, FFPE patient samples were collected from a single melanocytic nevus and single example of metastatic melanoma. Approximately 100,000 cells of melanocytic nevus and metastatic melanoma lesions were harvested with a Leica AS LMD laser microdissector. Proteins were uncross-linked and extracted with the Liquid Tissue MS Protein Prep Kit (Expression Pathology). Equal amounts of the proteins were split into 3 gel lanes and were analyzed by Coomassie/SDS-PAGE, which revealed the extraction of micrograms of protein (Figure 1). Each gel lane was sliced into 17 bands of 2 mm each and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides from the 102 gel bands were analyzed by LC-MS/MS with a Thermo LTQ-XL mass spectrometer coupled to an Eksigent nanoLC-2D (6). We identified a total of 888 proteins (0.45% false discovery rate using a decoy database from 56,013 spectra). Relaxing the stringency of the protein identification to a false discovery rate of 1.7% provided for the identification of 1,167 unique proteins from 88,180 spectra.

In order to determine whether a protein was differentially expressed between nevus and metastatic melanoma samples, a label-free approach based on spectral counting was used (7,8,9,10). Spectral count is the number of tandem mass spectra assigned to a given protein in all bands from a single gel lane. To determine the relative amount of a protein in a given gel lane, a normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) was calculated (7). The NSAF was calculated as follows: 
 
 
(NSAF)k=(SpCL)kâˆ‘i=1N(SpCL)i 
 
 
where k is a given protein, SpC is the spectral count, L is the length of the protein, and N is all proteins identified in the gel lane. Plotting the frequency distribution of ln(NSAF) values clearly showed that the data followed a normal distribution as indicated by the fitting of a Gaussian curve with an R2 value of 0.99 (Figure 2A). In accordance to t-test, there were 390 proteins out of 888 total proteins that were found differentially expressed (p<0.05) between metastatic melanoma and nevus lesions. The distribution of the p-values from the t-test was then divided into bins of size 0.025 and the number of proteins for each bin plotted in a bar graph (Figure 2B). The 32 most significant proteins, according to the lowest p-value from the t-test and adjusted with Bonferroni correction, were visually inspected by hierarchical clustering (Figure 2C). Two proteins of particular interest, silver and fatty acid synthase (SILV and FASN), were found in the top 10 most significant proteins and appeared as up-regulated in metastatic melanoma as compared to melanocytic nevus. SILV and FASN both have been shown to be up-regulated in cancers, which makes them appropriate validation tools for this proof-of-principle study (11,12,13).

Label-free quantification of proteins identified from FFPE nevus and metastatic melanoma tissues 
 
 
 
For validation, melanocytic nevus and melanoma samples were stained with either SILV or FASN antibodies and the samples were scored based on the intensity of the staining and the percentage of extent (Figures 3 & 4). The intensity of staining was scored as nil (0), low (1), medium (2), or high (3). The percentage of melanocyte or melanoma cell staining was scored as 0 (no staining), 1 ( 50% staining). The intensity was multiplied by the percentage of extent and the following product is then categorized as such: 0â€“1 is 0; 2â€“3 is 1+; 4â€“5 is 2+; 6â€“9 is 3+. In general, most of benign lesions (benign nevi or dysplastic nevi) have low or no expression (0 or 1+) of SILV or FASN. Many of the melanomas have higher expression (2+ or 3+) of SILV or FAS. Table 1 shows the number of cases with each score for SILV and FASN indicating higher staining in melanoma compared to benign. Both SILV and FASN were found to be significantly different by Chi square analysis between melanoma and benign with p-values of >0.0001 and 0.0015, respectively.

In conclusion, we present an unbiased, high throughput and quantitative approach for the identification of proteins that are differentially expressed in metastatic melanoma. Using quantitative label-free mass spectrometry of laser microdissected samples, we have identified 390 proteins differentially expressed in melanoma. Two of these proteins, silver and fatty acid synthase, were validated as being up-regulated in melanoma.

0810a2fb7edcebd1f9de87e28ecd66f7dfb49205,Associations between Maternal Tobacco Smoke Exposure and the Cord Blood CD4+ DNA Methylome,"BACKGROUND
Maternal tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with altered DNA methylation. However, previous studies largely used methylation arrays, which cover a small fraction of CpGs, and focused on whole cord blood.


OBJECTIVES
The current study examined the impact of in utero exposure to maternal tobacco smoke on the cord blood [Formula: see text] DNA methylome.


METHODS
The methylomes of 20 Hispanic white newborns ([Formula: see text] exposed to any maternal tobacco smoke in pregnancy; [Formula: see text] unexposed) from the Maternal and Child Health Study (MACHS) were profiled by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (median coverage: [Formula: see text]). Statistical analyses were conducted using the Regression Analysis of Differential Methylation (RADMeth) program because it performs well on low-coverage data (minimizes false positives and negatives).


RESULTS
We found that 10,381 CpGs were differentially methylated by tobacco smoke exposure [neighbor-adjusted p-values that are additionally corrected for multiple testing based on the Benjamini-Hochberg method for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) [Formula: see text]]. From these CpGs, RADMeth identified 557 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were overrepresented ([Formula: see text]) in important regulatory regions, including enhancers. Of nine DMRs that could be queried in a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) study of adult [Formula: see text] cells ([Formula: see text] smokers; [Formula: see text] nonsmokers), four replicated ([Formula: see text]). Additionally, a CpG in the promoter of SLC7A8 (percent methylation difference: [Formula: see text] comparing exposed to unexposed) replicated ([Formula: see text]) in an EPIC (Illumina) array study of cord blood [Formula: see text] cells ([Formula: see text] exposed to sustained maternal tobacco smoke; [Formula: see text] unexposed) and in a study of adult [Formula: see text] cells across two platforms (EPIC: [Formula: see text] smokers; [Formula: see text] nonsmokers; 450K: [Formula: see text] smokers; [Formula: see text] nonsmokers).


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal tobacco smoke exposure in pregnancy is associated with cord blood [Formula: see text] DNA methylation in key regulatory regions, including enhancers. While we used a method that performs well on low-coverage data, we cannot exclude the possibility that some results may be false positives. However, we identified a differentially methylated CpG in amino acid transporter SLC7A8 that is highly reproducible, which may be sensitive to cigarette smoke in both cord blood and adult [Formula: see text] cells. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3398.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Caitlin G Howe"", ids = ""5531636""); list(name = ""Meng Zhou"", ids = ""47483242""); list(name = ""Xuting Wang"", ids = ""2725264""); list(name = ""Gary S.

Imprinted genes exhibit expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner and are critical for child development. Recent limited evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to phthalates, ubiquitous endocrine disruptors, can affect their epigenetic dysregulation.


MATERIALS & METHODS
We quantified DNA methylation of nine imprinted gene differentially methylated regions by pyrosequencing in 296 cord blood DNA samples in a Mexican-American cohort. Fetal exposure was estimated by phthalate metabolite concentrations in maternal urine samples during pregnancy.


RESULTS
Several differentially methylated regions of imprinted genes were associated with high molecular weight phthalates. The most consistent, positive, and false discovery rate significant associations were observed for MEG3.

32727f67e9f6ed28fc1b680a80ae11a2dd55cbc2,Profiles of Emerging and Legacy Per-/Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Matched Serum and Semen Samples: New Implications for Human Semen Quality,"BACKGROUND
Epidemiological evidence remains equivocal on the associations between environmentally relevant levels of per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and human semen quality.


OBJECTIVES
We aimed to test whether the potential effects on semen quality could be better observed when seminal PFAS levels were used as an exposure marker compared with serum PFAS levels.


METHODS
Matched semen and serum samples from 664 adult men were collected from a cross-sectional population in China from 2015 to 2016. Multiple semen parameters were assessed, along with measurement of 16 target PFASs in semen and serum. Partitioning between semen and serum was evaluated by the ratio of matrix-specific PFAS concentrations. Regression model results were expressed as the difference in each semen parameter associated with the per unit increase in the ln-transformed PFAS level after adjusting for confounders.


RESULTS
Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and emerging chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) were detected at their highest concentrations in both semen and serum, with median concentrations of 0.23, 0.10, and 0.06â€‰ng/mL in semen, respectively, and a semen-to-serum ratio of 1.3:3.1. The between-matrix correlations of these PFAS concentrations were high (R=0.70-0.83). Seminal PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA levels were significantly associated with a lower percentage of progressive sperm and higher percentage of DNA fragmentation (false discovery rate-adjusted p-valuesâ€‰of<0.05). Associations between serum PFAS levels and semen parameters were generally statistically weaker, except for DNA stainability, which was more strongly associated with serum-based PFASs than with semen-based PFASs.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest the potential for deleterious effects following exposure to 6:2 Cl-PFESA and other PFASs. Compared with serum PFAS levels, the much clearer association of seminal PFAS levels with semen parameters suggests its advantage in hazard assessment on semen quality, although the potential for confounding might be higher. Exposure measurements in target tissue may be critical in clarifying effects related to PFAS exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4431.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yitao Pan"", ids = ""7303167""); list(name = ""Qianqian Cui"", ids = ""5365363""); list(name = ""Jinghua Wang"", ids = ""47422653""); list(name = ""Nan Sheng"", ids = ""144175148""); list(name = ""Jun Feng Jing"", ids = ""39675699""); list(name = ""Bing Yao"", ids = ""146317203""); list(name = ""Jiayin Dai"", ids = ""47708907"")",,,Environmental Health Perspectives,127,

The second part of this chapter is concerned with model selection. Section 3.3 starts by introducing the basic concepts of likelihood and then recapitulates the development of Akaikeâ€™s information criterion (AIC) using information theoretic principles. This is then compared with the use of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in the context of Bayesian model selection. It is then pointed out why both AIC and BIC fail to work in a high-dimensional setting and different modifications of BIC designed to control either FWER or FDR are presented.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate protein synthesis through post-transcriptional suppression. This study is to identify new miRNA markers in inflammatory bowel disease, and to examine whether miRNA biomarkers might assist in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Illumina small RNA sequencing was performed on non-dysplastic fresh-frozen colonic mucosa samples of the distalmost colectomy tissue from 19 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (10 ulcerative colitis and 9 Crohn disease) and 18 patients with diverticular disease serving as controls. To determine differentially expressed miRNAs, the USeq software package identified 44 miRNAs with altered expression (fold change â‰¥2 and false discovery rate â‰¤0.10) compared with the controls. Among them, a panel of nine miRNAs was aberrantly expressed in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Validation assays performed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on additional frozen tissue from ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and control groups confirmed specific differential expression in inflammatory bowel disease for miR-31, miR-206, miR-424, and miR-146a (P<0.05). The expression of these four miRNAs was further evaluated on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the distalmost colectomy mucosa from cohorts of diverticular disease controls (n=29), ulcerative colitis (n=36), Crohn disease (n=26), and the other diseases mimicking inflammatory bowel disease including infectious colitis (n=12) and chronic ischemic colitis (n=19), again confirming increased expression specific to inflammatory bowel disease (P<0.05). In summary, we demonstrate that miR-31, miR-206, miR-424, and miR-146a are novel specific biomarkers of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, miR-31 is universally expressed in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease not only in fresh-frozen but also in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jingmei Lin"", ids = ""6186918""); list(name = ""Noah C.

06ff4d8e5b6d34ceae13aae38290b767611c44fc,Aging shapes the population-mean and â€dispersion of gene expression in human brains,"Human aging is associated with cognitive decline and an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. Our objective for this study was to evaluate potential relationships between age and variation in gene expression across different regions of the brain. We analyzed the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data from 54 and 101 tissue samples across 13 brain regions in post-mortem donors of European descent aged between 20 and 70 years at death. After accounting for the effects of covariates and hidden confounding factors, we identified 1,446 protein-coding genes whose expression in one or more brain regions is correlated with chronological age at a false discovery rate of 5%. These genes are involved in various biological processes including apoptosis, mRNA splicing, amino acid biosynthesis, and neurotransmitter transport. The distribution of these genes among brain regions is uneven, suggesting variable regional responses to aging. We also found that the aging response of many genes, e.g., TP37 and C1QA, depends on individualsâ€™ genotypic backgrounds. Finally, using dispersion-specific analysis, we identified genes such as IL7R, MS4A4E, and TERF1/TERF2 whose expressions are differentially dispersed by aging, i.e., variances differ between age groups. Our results demonstrate that age-related gene expression is brain region-specific, genotype-dependent, and associated with both mean and dispersion changes. Our findings provide a foundation for more sophisticated gene expression modeling in the studies of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Candice L Brinkmeyer-Langford"", ids = ""1401291387""); list(name = ""Jinting Guan"", ids = ""2119215""); list(name = ""Guoli Ji"", ids = ""46423830""); list(name = ""James J.

dd16825e7233739d8a13bc99b82f13258ac72f63,Proteomic responses to elevated ocean temperature in ovaries of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis,"Ciona intestinalis, a common sea squirt, exhibits lower reproductive success at the upper extreme of the water temperatures it experiences in coastal New England. In order to understand the changes in protein expression associated with elevated temperatures, and possible response to global temperature change, we reared C. intestinalis from embryos to adults at 18Â°C (a temperature at which they reproduce normally at our collection site in Rhode Island) and 22Â°C (the upper end of the local temperature range). We then dissected ovaries from animals at each temperature, extracted protein, and measured proteomic levels using shotgun mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 1532 proteins were detected at a 1% false discovery rate present in both temperature groups by our LC-MS/MS method. 62 of those proteins are considered up- or down-regulated according to our statistical criteria. Principal component analysis shows a clear distinction in protein expression pattern between the control (18Â°C) group and high temperature (22Â°C) group. Similar to previous studies, cytoskeletal and chaperone proteins are upregulated in the high temperature group. Unexpectedly, we find evidence that proteolysis is downregulated at the higher temperature.

0c0f9a15c6e152f972cc9cfabe08b7cd6496f553,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 gene (CRHR1) are associated with quantitative trait of event-related potential and alcohol dependence.,"BACKGROUND
Endophenotypes reflect more proximal effects of genes than diagnostic categories, hence providing a more powerful strategy in searching for genes involved in complex psychiatric disorders. There is strong evidence suggesting the P3 amplitude of the event-related potential (ERP) as an endophenotype for the risk of alcoholism and other disinhibitory disorders. Recent studies demonstrated a crucial role of corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) in the environmental stress response and ethanol self-administration in animal models. The aim of the present study was to test the potential associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRHR1 gene and the quantitative trait, P3 amplitude during the processing of visual target signals in an oddball paradigm, as well as alcohol dependence diagnosis.


METHODS
We analyzed a sample from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) comprising 1049 Caucasian subjects from 209 families (including 472 alcohol-dependent individuals). Quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) and family-based association test (FBAT) were used to test the association, and false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to correct for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Significant associations (p < 0.05) were found between the P3 amplitude and alcohol dependence with multiple SNPs in the CRHR1 gene.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that CRHR1 may be involved in modulating the P3 component of the ERP during information processing and in vulnerability to alcoholism. These findings underscore the utility of electrophysiology and the endophenotype approach in the genetic study of psychiatric disorders.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrew Chih-Hui Chen"", ids = ""49674362""); list(name = ""Niklas Manz"", ids = ""6404321""); list(name = ""Yongqiang Tang"", ids = ""46556641""); list(name = ""Madhavi Rangaswamy"", ids = ""1903261""); list(name = ""Laura Almasy"", ids = ""2907225""); list(name = ""Samuel Kuperman"", ids = ""145816087""); list(name = ""John I.

456b6563b2e757e35f19b8be8c6c8f274a8198e9,Integrated Cognitive and Neuromotor Rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis: A Pragmatic Study,"Background: Few studies examined the effects of combined motor and cognitive rehabilitation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The present prospective, multicenter, observational study aimed to determine the efficacy of an integrated cognitive and neuromotor rehabilitation program versus a traditional neuromotor training on walking, balance, cognition and emotional functioning in MS patients. Methods: Sixty three MS patients were selected and assigned either to the Integrated Treatment Group (ITG; n = 32), receiving neuropsychological treatment (performed by ERICA software and paper-pencil tasks) complemented by conventional neuromotor rehabilitation, or to the Motor Treatment Group (n = 31) receiving neuromotor rehabilitation only. The intervention included two 60-min sessions per week for 24 weeks. At baseline and at end of the training all patients underwent a wide-range neuropsychological, psychological/emotional, and motor assessment. Results: At baseline the two groups did not differ for demographic, neuropsychological, psychological/emotional, and motor features significantly. After rehabilitation, only ITG group significantly (p-corrected for False Discovery Rate) improved on test tapping spatial memory, attention and cognitive flexibility, as well as on scales assessing depression and motor performance (balance and gait). A regression analysis showed that neuropsychological and motor improvement was not related to improvements in fatigue and depression. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated positive effects in emotional, motor, and cognitive aspects in MS patients who received an integrated cognitive and neuromotor training. Overall, results are supportive of interventions combining motor and cognitive training for MS.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anna Maria Barbarulo"", ids = ""3686058""); list(name = ""Giacomo Lus"", ids = ""4671941""); list(name = ""Elisabetta Signoriello"", ids = ""4049647""); list(name = ""Luigi Trojano"", ids = ""2328398""); list(name = ""Dario Grossi"", ids = ""145685893""); list(name = ""M Esposito"", ids = ""152854696""); list(name = ""Teresa Costabile"", ids = ""8025077""); list(name = ""Roberta Lanzillo"", ids = ""3665188""); list(name = ""Francesco SaccÃ "", ids = ""2970363""); list(name = ""Vincenzo Brescia Morra"", ids = ""144446890""); list(name = ""Giovannina Conchiglia"", ids = ""7909442"")",bbe1f1eb5508761c97241d0fc61e08966ff8024b,74b640ca32d3875eeadf0800f7d1298ac2783966; 9aa12ad9d24420b605d889ef21ccc8590da0db3e; dd80b932fb46c2ce243fb2365ddced50805177c3; 90af28c84c3951f71bc9300672a65cbcc7e2a538; e0a75a23da4e53de35f4af649be67d33a53f5c06; 8f37f9cdc8aec569892683cdd771bedb188ad782; 06f938a066fb1a4942f2d93608176f83f2fa9fcc; 32918d5471d8f5d03c3787f1a8adb95ae52e3883; da6761e86b22d7379c31f71316695fba435589cc; 390f3988d312afe2ed2e02fb4ea0ce1b22883ac6; f64ba212989f7b07e6fd6f305d4324eb8d9a7d72; 5cb435a6ae0f73d2157614e4bfbc527eac627c2b; c53940d4fbd43d41b119fca8cc68434a371472ee; d4d2e45b514a35df2abe450f2d0ae278c5b2ec69; a92cddd8c11b170db9ec0d2de5e4a19530e0eab0; 2f463f31dd68d39abc582b738e581003bf1c9f4a; 02e64a5eea512376c30c46345678a581b994e2b0; e995514530d12552a41ecdc279ff07ea00ef212f; 1adb45ff976e432aa14add2f0102cf8ea55bf718; 90acff1148c618a1abc8ff2005ef6ce5d2e05920; dc8a46a40c4997b91361a2bb0aa104abd8b7e85e; da962669d5a553daacbd327c788a08435a893589; acf7524ff61384295f87026a1097a15fb1b0ca43; a74bd325aac1b629b5c7b72928ea2eaf15e22a46; 8530a991938fbe4b6de8f75d8ab47e59c0f235b3; 9b1406bd4bc068fcf46a718cde175f0794c277b0; dcadc8fc5bf5534c20824842d8719e33c4ee2640; 09733bf1e96025785bd0110cdb68b51f2834c967; 7d52915ec7b6157793ed7dbcd9c2e7d6f9033ee1; 2b5a48d3ad778f2127566ac844c6c26a886c187e; d331a00683b4a21ef12feaca4172cb86c9b3e539; 6cb6760526f95562de1d6c671879dbe134cee593; 0d4f3bb64a5670051e0f319a7af9af5a4bdefa1f; b76d574b95a6073f2552a8f92d37c919b2c7dc47; 3e6856840c28651dffe692c9290019a34abcbbf4; 180976de27ade8752a2f97315c598b2dfb147642; 92305f28bf7e30d83bc9cf17883e8a4a634276a8; 9dccdc7f11803b73a04e3a510bceb973a850930f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 749f565b262e186df8dcc4eaec8f1f44109e9300; 2f8701f6721677943811ca1dcfe73ef6b419fc11; 3ba2060444c68885ada60ee48070604f1235dae2; bd6863650ee6928ea19b22493f219af59a4d2851; 06efcfaa316c17ef74154ed87cfa8001bf9ed449; 396f9faec2db8c4b1901b1e20a01f55ab1b61edc; 88f87109e589b94df4f87b5b87aaba8717bf2d8e; bf5db9506ecf72162a5f0b34927c05b4ba25b0ac; 8676eb5f1d9eff35b366a173f80469be4defbb25; fd5c075a70b1a3788d467349c58d5071f8e7c06e; 0ed3119b0eb879c2fd209e59238fd12a12153e6c; 59535c428d096ad3ae01dd261c5f9d8fded3e4a5; d8c5b0cd0aa2d1d7f1386c0de190cd345f4c4adc; dc6b36e5143e135e7f02e7f0f428c00b247d7782; 0532409fef5eb0e545d971ff621020940766825c; 87ca9b5c9884da834a477d0c2f1581af061b2293; b88d4399d262b8c816fd04da82778790b1d02132; 13e51a526cf0ba8fd9771d7adfb4451408ffc920; ec92ad4c5f0136bca4a3b80f23673851085bd971; 213e55ce8897997833ab16ea1f6539a617dbb453; 3e862fbfd6e7e684b17f00ac50ff4e3e8c7f85fb; 984b54073b55d8e55b366122e39945a9b8079cff; 2da0dda8b5fbea35258f171c67e05cfb696f88a1; 47d4644f61472402671fd2f739ace11804acbc46; cf7788bf399b12c5c9b4f49b4b0dcd7299c531b3; 0712731ef437707cc2d5cd46e6a13dd26fefba65; 20261866a626d8e9b3f52d41a86e268e46045270; 9b2520f4112f364bf8b48ccfe83bb5452fbfd3ec; d351bf81a79b276c8dddc82a0052afe2fdcc871d; aa4277256e77a22239ea75969c09dd68123b4b35,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,12,
c897a123c0c61878b714f2a6d30cb5290d1dda74,A pooling-based genome-wide analysis identifies new potential candidate genes for atopy in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS),"BackgroundAsthma and atopy are complex phenotypes with shared genetic component. In this study we attempt to identify genes related to these traits performing a two-stage DNA pooling genome-wide analysis in order to reduce costs. First, we assessed all markers in a subset of subjects using DNA pooling, and in a second stage we evaluated the most promising markers at an individual level.MethodsFor the genome-wide analysis, we constructed DNA pools from 75 subjects with atopy and asthma, 75 subjects with atopy and without asthma and 75 control subjects without atopy or asthma. In a second stage, the most promising regions surrounding significant markers after correction for false discovery rate were replicated with individual genotyping of samples included in the pools and an additional set of 429 atopic subjects and 222 controls from the same study centres.ResultsHomo sapiens protein kinase-like protein SgK493 (SGK493) was found to be associated with atopy. To lesser extent mitogen-activated protein kinase 5 (MAP3K5), collagen type XVIII alpha 1 (COL18A1) and collagen type XXIX alpha 1 (COL29A1) were also found to be associated with atopy.

3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca,Some results on false discovery rate in stepwise multiple testing procedures,"The concept of false discovery rate (FDR) has been receiving increasing attention by researchers in multiple hypotheses testing. This paper produces some theoretical results on the FDR in the context of stepwise multiple testing procedures with dependent test statistics. It was recently shown by Benjamini and Yekutieli that the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg step-up procedure controls the FDR when the test statistics are positively dependent in a certain sense. This paper strengthens their work by showing that the critical values of that procedure can be used in a much more general stepwise procedure under similar positive dependency. It is also shown that the FDR-controlling Benjaminiâ€“Liu step-down procedure originally developed for independent test statistics works even when the test statistics are positively dependent in some sense. An explicit expression for the FDR of a generalized stepwise procedure and an upper bound to the FDR of a step-down procedure are obtained in terms of probability distributions of ordered components of dependent random variables before establishing the main results. 1. Introduction. The main purpose of this paper is to present some formulas and inequalities providing theoretical insight into when and what stepwise procedures control the false discovery rate (FDR) at a prespecified level in multiple hypotheses testing. The FDR, first introduced in multiple testing by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), is the expected proportion of erroneously rejected null hypotheses. With V and R representing, respectively, the number of true null hypotheses rejected and the total number of null hypotheses rejected in a multiple testing procedure, let Q = V/ R if R> 0a nd= 0i fR = 0. Then E(Q) is the FDR of that procedure. As they have argued, it is an appropriate error rate to control in many practical situations, particularly where a large number of null hypotheses are involved. They also put forward an FDR-controlling stepup procedure that is more powerful than comparable procedures controlling the traditional familywise error (FWE) rate when the underlying test statistics are independent. Benjamini and Liu (1999) recently introduced a step-down procedure with the same property. The concept of FDR is now being used in a wide variety of applications [Abramovich and Benjamini (1996), Basford and Tukey (1997), Drigalenko",2002,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

e91da87cf37d6efc60dd21fd11de1fe2ac42fd58,Using Machine Learning to Measure Relatedness Between Genes: A Multi-Features Model,"Measuring conditional relatedness between a pair of genes is a fundamental technique and still a significant challenge in computational biology. Such relatedness can be assessed by gene expression similarities while suffering high false discovery rates. Meanwhile, other types of features, e.g., prior-knowledge based similarities, is only viable for measuring global relatedness. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, named Multi-Features Relatedness (MFR), for accurately measuring conditional relatedness between a pair of genes by incorporating expression similarities with prior-knowledge based similarities in an assessment criterion. MFR is used to predict gene-gene interactions extracted from the COXPRESdb, KEGG, HPRD, and TRRUST databases by the 10-fold cross validation and test verification, and to identify gene-gene interactions collected from the GeneFriends and DIP databases for further verification. The results show that MFR achieves the highest area under curve (AUC) values for identifying gene-gene interactions in the development, test, and DIP datasets. Specifically, it obtains an improvement of 1.1% on average of precision for detecting gene pairs with both high expression similarities and high prior-knowledge based similarities in all datasets, comparing to other linear models and coexpression analysis methods. Regarding cancer gene networks construction and gene function prediction, MFR also obtains the results with more biological significances and higher average prediction accuracy, than other compared models and methods.

f9e45f2c8d50b37517f24305485d6d7637647aad,Bayesian estimation of differential transcript usage from RNA-seq data,"Abstract Next generation sequencing allows the identification of genes consisting of differentially expressed transcripts, a term which usually refers to changes in the overall expression level. A specific type of differential expression is differential transcript usage (DTU) and targets changes in the relative within gene expression of a transcript. The contribution of this paper is to: (a) extend the use of cjBitSeq to the DTU context, a previously introduced Bayesian model which is originally designed for identifying changes in overall expression levels and (b) propose a Bayesian version of DRIMSeq, a frequentist model for inferring DTU. cjBitSeq is a read based model and performs fully Bayesian inference by MCMC sampling on the space of latent state of each transcript per gene. BayesDRIMSeq is a count based model and estimates the Bayes Factor of a DTU model against a null model using Laplaceâ€™s approximation. The proposed models are benchmarked against the existing ones using a recent independent simulation study as well as a real RNA-seq dataset. Our results suggest that the Bayesian methods exhibit similar performance with DRIMSeq in terms of precision/recall but offer better calibration of False Discovery Rate.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Panagiotis Papastamoulis"", ids = ""2844876""); list(name = ""Magnus Rattray"", ids = ""145749654"")",558ba01909a83a7a560564e295a7668a56c4c010; 727bef807477c2e7fc2333328a19422fdebbe525; 85381ff604caa423b71820fcc375001820d1198d,d50458c350897b517ac409a568b941e13f071e76; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; 5794f07b2ce5a04241198d42e81623380d2c7e2e; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 9873a6453ec35a65596263d66529131cba188e60; 961e2156d523e3901c491cc2a1f65764c976fc44; c760e0246bdfd660f681eecc7dd06ae82e6761ba; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; 475e0371a1b1c903eeff45c328d825f4537ab746; 6ce7876c0b2acb52b88610ce9cfe21d239c28922; 65a28ac99b760994c6f7b95e37ce8f4569867362; 1d8e82fa957917ac0d2c4794a1bcb7c6cb7ce42b; cff4b999fdd2f751a566e65423a80cbd8405a163; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884; 7657d04b3c17da1421fa1d725613df9477ca610b; c06e4f9f0cd4e519fe2bba7019a03e3194e88d43; 90362d21c55b9772f68178481bb60e52f842d9f4; 6d476ca3e8d742ef0e02bbec3c980662abc61fef; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 55507aba54a92b31a200e8112f088f5c356ed7bc; 33449e0a403b8f40cb478f116b8c2775cae15510; 8d990deca66c9afefbe042f95e41ada0c7227877; 949565e275b7f0f461c41825404d31be5b904b88; fa2d84282f2e8cfaa67d15f9a99c6a23fc7578c5; 1d2dedb564e7582274a319d3ad4c108c80fc5f78; 392419be99be9eb730ba168f0edbc35d0526ff93; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; 6ce6b69ccb04334d80ba398530b54f14aac4adaa; 977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 7d7a296a0b0210be84934120396a41b7f7b2c25f; aa7138c899fd48d3c8df2ccbb65dce06ca4d12c2; 362632b9a06ea7ffd4d34ca40a324979a9ae9eea; fbe678e40aed14fd7b93349c1cd1dda833cdfe9b; 83a3201194f134b2b2696adb6c64968bacb0ef5b; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; cc68a9a80903e1b32014b36e125989b427c70451; ee41b4317af7fb87c3178b2b7676b135212f504c; 9b685c9e933e292d3e4319d055863f9af6b680ce; bc50cc98f0abb84f5841278eee8f2677726a56a7; f4e98d7204bc57663edce8d24ee979bd191ef2ff; 235c622485190b74c808c3f84339625a4d2975c6,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,16,387 - 405
ea795aa08f642a2d8944f71d7f13a689661d91df,A ranking-based strategy to prune variable selection ensembles,"Ensemble pruning techniques are introduced in the context of variable selection.A ranking-based strategy is devised to prune a variable selection ensemble.The ensemble members are sorted by the prediction error of their associated models.Higher selection accuracy is gained by fusing fewer members ranked ahead.The superiority of the novel method over some other methods is validated. Ensemble learning has attracted significant interest in the literature of variable selection due to its great potential to reduce false discovery rate and to stabilize selection results. In this paper, a novel ensemble pruning technique called PST2E (i.e., pruned ST2E) is introduced to obtain smaller but stronger variable selection ensembles. For the ensemble members generated by the ST2E algorithm [3], we sort them in descending order according to the prediction errors associated with their determined models. Subsequently, only a desired number of members ranked ahead are integrated to compose a subensemble. On the basis of the average importance measures produced by the pruned ensemble, all candidate variables are then ranked and decided to be important or not. In the context of linear and logistic regression models, the experiments conducted with both simulated and real-world data illustrate that PST2E significantly outperforms several other popular techniques in most cases when evaluating them with multiple measures. Another advantage of PST2E is that it admits easy implementation. As a result, PST2E can be deemed as an attractive alternative to tackle variable selection tasks in real applications.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chun-Xia Zhang"", ids = ""2147052""); list(name = ""Jiang-She Zhang"", ids = ""123275655""); list(name = ""Qingyan Yin"", ids = ""32686728"")",d9a4b9ed5d1996184eecd330afc339b66ff08647; 56dfc93a3b99c87e24a8a5474bd3b3b82c6e107b; 6953b1e99155d644cb795ed90880b0042e77b1a2; 2bdb31efed951afcc80c7a93db51bc0d3a55c5e4; 3794434817c8b1e49cce8888abe5656ef39b0012,,Knowl.

We used the first phase (1988â€“1991) of the NHANES III to identify factors with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <5%. Of these, we tentatively replicated our findings in the second phase (1992â€“1994) of the survey. Principal component analysis was performed to identify unobserved factors underlying the association between validated factors and abdominal obesity, defined as waist circumference >88â€‰cm for women and >102â€‰cm for men.Results:We found five tentatively replicated factors showing significant associations with abdominal obesity in men: serum Î±-carotene, Î²-carotene, serum Î²-cryptoxanthin, serum vitamin D and vigorous physical activity. In women, 7 factors were identified: serum Î±-carotene, Î²-carotene, serum Î²-cryptoxanthin, serum vitamin C, serum vitamin D, vigorous physical activity and aspartame intake. In contrast to the other factors which showed inverse associations with abdominal obesity, aspartame intake displayed a positive relationship with this outcome (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10â€“1.26 for each log increase in aspartame intake in women). Principal component analysis suggested three principal components underlying such associations, each comprising: (1) serum antioxidants; (2) serum vitamin D and vigorous physical activity; and (3) aspartame intake. All three principal components also displayed significant associations with abdominal obesity.Conclusion:Our observational investigation that systematically investigates multiple modifiable factors simultaneously has enabled the creation of data-driven hypotheses regarding the possible role of determinants of abdominal obesity and has identified potential avenues for mechanistic investigations to clarify suitable targets of intervention.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wahyu Wulaningsih"", ids = ""4456506""); list(name = ""Mieke Van Hemelrijck"", ids = ""8166953""); list(name = ""Konstantinos K Tsilidis"", ids = ""12980841""); list(name = ""Ioanna Tzoulaki"", ids = ""145781843""); list(name = ""Chirag Dahyabhai Patel"", ids = ""47480123""); list(name = ""Sabine Rohrmann"", ids = ""5961057"")",7b3a98e60018d1b8874a8b5313fe9b55f8baf736; a3974d0cecbc4ae837e283945c3606bccfcb6a6b; 182ebb0accae659c034417df862148a655388d08; a083a034550c6a3497c37855acf0295c71ab97ed,ead6703ac12894fff296e4dd230f95f7543af486; 4f830f55abc04c1ef832ec9f90f19f0425f71fd9; e36be214adf97b8bb2d7c82ccfa88d28ea4ca10e; dd813edd93704db5070978d13a5cde640bc1e2eb; 42e9b262923251ba894accaf586df615259a874a; 51d0c18635b0420fc2033482afbe0bb2e9fea6d7; 721a15dbba2f685fc984215b6a5624a787c452a2; fa64f465a8ede33c2b88937060cb6824f0f76ab6; b5ec13e7938dce53af9216b026accbda451bfbc8; 5f0c3e19aa5014a6ef13b61166201a347784e530; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 3dcc1d1717d87f9ab1f3f1ef6b29a2afa4f4fd3c; 421950a5548ffd9aaa4996e466e49894edc9be2f; 52bcdd6058e112b56b0e43d95ff284e10bd6c8a2; e98478927a1334991b127aadcd0bbdaa439e2d54; e6e24da4e1f9bae8d97483ca86727165157fef02; 3e7b8090990eec8efd1fd69d56c6209d764f2e83; b64169928fb22784a352c60fb60f8eef036f2241; 9043b736c593390f4389409f8051c95b75e1de97; 1b31fdcfad9148298a9a592f53a6079c0b9c6586; a08425b9eb5241904ac17edc533989c98a07b966; 2e49f269cc864e3361be16fa0b89f03fa62f1c06; d6aa73624553d0aa69792b50727736fa72608896; 7b048f94602b30df5a8e8fe1a1c075d39c03cf6e; cf40c163aedab3ce3ea65992b9a2f852b2546355; 8fcb72855ac753bb026703e0460bf6577a94c6ea; dc64c43415da544555ba545c36ec84b4cc81fa4c; bfccfd1b0f122ca8d27ae5eba094791c2ae9a417; bdcfa49c34d252ae511602eb6b2cc0bd2a46a238; 855ccdb31dfc1d1dd4190e0409f659fa11832ed5; 69268b2e84054577d41563f60160f2df19ac74a8; af4f90ab0229dcb2ea9e8fb9ea34b38b809e6db0; 749e74772607dc2401316abdb6deb3afad695886; 97d7041ca3378045c475cf1069ec3e74130f18e9; e7ee97ba0604a39cb41142e5356840c270e9a237; 693b9bee5ec37c7a7d9cae1b87861c1ecfb641d2; ac62808e5866bb54a28ca6dfd3154eb0fec8e7a6; 179da35c90aa05b13565d2b2a7548565593bab28; 321b9e4fdb03e835d5f11cbd2252a96ef6df0ba8; ac5f98aa444cd5b78f4e15303ff59a180b682736; eccd78627cfec7ea109f02699bc8eebb80acf5d5; 6c2ec1ab0cc877fc935e66f4f71c4d6459ef897d; 9a6833fcf9389c160e84787e2bc6c4fed926d1c0; 1ad289a6bae88d5c50964f86a5222bbf40941b4b; cf8fb6615dbba542fa0c4578668a121799472da3; 866d4ccd0148cb8ffe8129ba273b4dc20f73d47b; 42b51724a3e9e01863be13023afa91429ca530ea; 9fe12b2bc7539293ee8384641c3f51612907acef; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 87e4fd7ba01a86c32f8d97834bd7d9c2e49fb56e; fd527901f3558adf75f05101035afa53cdea8b90; 96f18452dd70e957e479239a872e026517d7de74; c8b142b6a3e57acceb35cf4efafb92d1a9f2aab3; 3a14152f47cbfd38db21a3d7e6b1b8cf0a887358; f6fc73da141325113c95e29e05b9be7872dbbe18; 47037525a6f26cbfe0368d30adecb5d7dfd990fa; b55caad4599fe112f20eec3b0c04362fc1a460ae; 5be129f9890f54157d5299c5bb3432d9d44707b2; b6f59c4f970219329190b879fb6f2196e4280aa6; b9d9355c6781f29baf330075bddb8cca427af445; 67a4bfe9f82dd0a2f9f4e7a9f0f4edbd355a3398; b7300919714dd4c7958ceda990ce0de0208a8f40; 52e2a8f2f248fcb6cab96cd547b37310c49ce6b5,International Journal of Obesity,41,340-347

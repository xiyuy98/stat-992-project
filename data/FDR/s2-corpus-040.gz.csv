b97ec725ff691370c882e1927e1770bfa9c60f9a,Integrated bioinformatics analysis for cancer target identification.,"The exponential growth of high-throughput Omics data has provided an unprecedented opportunity for new target identification to fuel the dried-up drug discovery pipeline. However, the bioinformatics analysis of large amount and heterogeneous Omics data has posed a great deal of technical challenges for experimentalists who lack statistical skills. Moreover, due to the complexity of human diseases, it is essential to analyze the Omics data in the context of molecular networks to detect meaningful biological targets and understand disease processes. Here, we describe an integrated bioinformatics analysis strategy and provide a running example to identify suitable targets for our in-house Enzyme-Mediated Cancer Imaging and Therapy (EMCIT) technology. In addition, we go through a few key concepts in the process, including corrected false discovery rate (FDR), Gene Ontology (GO), pathway analysis, and tissue specificity. We also describe popular programs and databases which allow the convenient annotation and network analysis of Omics data. We provide a practical guideline for researchers to quickly follow the protocol described and identify those targets that are pertinent to their work.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yongliang Yang"", ids = ""47796749""); list(name = ""S.

4b9d14563fb92968adacbb2919ccb2cb8f68e7ac,False Discovery Rates,"In hypothesis testing, statistical significance is typically based on calculations involving p-values and Type I error rates. A p-value calculated from a single statistical hypothesis test can be used to determine whether there is statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis. The upper threshold applied to the p-value in making this determination (often 5% in the scientific literature) determines the Type I error rate; i.e., the probability of making a Type I error when the null hypothesis is true. Multiple hypothesis testing is concerned with testing several statistical hypotheses simultaneously. Defining statistical significance is a more complex problem in this setting. A longstanding definition of statistical significance for multiple hypothesis tests involves the probability of making one or more Type I errors among the family of hypothesis tests, called the family-wise error rate. However, there exist other well established formulations of statistical significance for multiple hypothesis tests. The Bayesian framework for classification naturally allows one to calculate the probability that each null hypothesis is true given the observed data (Efron et al. 2001, Storey 2003), and several frequentist definitions of multiple hypothesis testing significance are also well established (Shaffer 1995). Soric (1989) proposed a framework for quantifying the statistical significance of multiple hypothesis tests based on the proportion of Type I errors among all hypothesis tests called statistically significant. He called statistically significant hypothesis tests discoveries and proposed that one be concerned about the rate of false discoveries1 when testing multiple hypotheses. This false discovery rate is robust to the false positive paradox and is particularly useful in exploratory analyses, where one is more concerned with having mostly true findings among a set of statistically significant discoveries rather than guarding against one or more false positives. Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) provided the first implementation of false discovery rates with known operating characteristics. The idea of quantifying the rate of false discoveries is directly related to several pre-existing ideas, such as Bayesian misclassification rates and the positive predictive value (Storey 2003).",2010,,"list(name = ""John D.

453bf8185360623ef76a081b6b2cadddd73ee027,Epigenetic Signatures Accurately Distinguish Leukemia Subtypes and Provide a More Comprehensive Representation of Differentially Regulated Genes Than Gene Expression Profiling.,"Acute leukemias are a heterogeneous group of tumors, the molecular basis of which remains poorly understood. Gene expression profiling (GEP) studies have provided insight into molecular pathogenesis and can classify patients into cohorts, which nonetheless still display considerable biological heterogeneity. However, GEP provides only a snapshot of mRNA levels at a given timepoint, without any information regarding gene regulatory status - i.e. their ability to be expressed or activated. Moreover, many important gene regulatory events are not accompanied by expression changes detectable by expression microarrays and are lost in the â€œnoiseâ€. We predicted that these limitations could be overcome by interrogating the epigenetic regulatory status of genes in addition to their mRNA levels. For this purpose we developed a method for detection of genome-wide DNA methylation called HELP (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by LM-PCR). HELP is based on comparative Msp1 and HpaII isoschizomer digestion, size-specific amplification of DNA fragments and co-hybridization to custom high-density oligonucleotide arrays designed specifically for this method and that provide data of uniform quality throughout the genome. We demonstrate here that HELP yields quantitative, reproducible (R>0.98) and robust signals in leukemia patient samples, as shown by bisulfite pyrosequencing validation. To compare and contrast the ability of HELP and GEP to identify molecular signatures and differentially regulated genes we performed a proof of principle study in a small cohort of AML and ALL patients, where GEP on high density oligonucleotide arrays and HELP were performed in triplicate for each patient. We found that unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation data more accurately classified acute leukemias according to lineage than GEP; Specific methylation signatures distinctive of AML vs. ALL could be readily identified by performing correspondence analysis; promoter methylation analysis yielded twice as many informative loci than GEP (600 differentially methylated genes vs. 300 differentially expressed genes with False Discovery Rate = 1%). While 90% of the differentially expressed genes were also detected by HELP, the latter further identified another 300 genes that were missed by GEP but that are differentially methylated in ALL vs. AML. Genes discovered by HELP but missed by GEP were mainly regulators of cellular proliferation, hematopoietic differentiation, apoptosis and intracellular signaling. examples of candidate genes differentially methylated between AML vs. ALL but not detected by GEP include: TNF receptor family members, Caspase 9, DNA fragmentation factor, Methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR), and the tumor suppressor PAX7. These results suggest that DNA methylation signatures accurately classify disease subtypes and identify a greater number of genes with potential biological importance than GEP. Rigorous epigenetic signature studies by HELP might thus provide a more accurate and comprehensive method for molecular classification and characterization of acute leukemias and other tumors.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""MarÃ­a Eugenia Figueroa"", ids = ""143969499""); list(name = ""Kenny Ye"", ids = ""40452325""); list(name = ""Elisabeth Paietta"", ids = ""3638156""); list(name = ""John M.

This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms of OC and identify potential molecular targets for OC treatment. Methods and Study Design Microarray gene expression data (GSE14407) including 12 normal ovarian surface epithelia samples and 12 OC epithelia samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 2 kinds of ovarian tissue were identified by using limma package in R language (|log2 fold change| >1 and false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and known OC-related genes were screened from COXPRESdb and GenBank database, respectively. Furthermore, PPI network of top 10 upregulated DEGs and top 10 downregulated DEGs was constructed and visualized through Cytoscape software. Finally, for the genes involved in PPI network, functional enrichment analysis was performed by using DAVID (FDR <0.05). Results In total, 1136 DEGs were identified, including 544 downregulated and 592 upregulated DEGs. Then, PPI network was constructed, and DEGs CDKN2A, MUC1, OGN, ZIC1, SOX17, and TFAP2A interacted with known OC-related genes CDK4, EGFR/JUN, SRC, CLI1, CTNNB1, and TP53, respectively. Moreover, functions about oxygen transport and embryonic development were enriched by the genes involved in the network of downregulated DEGs. Conclusions We propose that 4 DEGs (OGN, ZIC1, SOX17, and TFAP2A) and 2 functions (oxygen transport and embryonic development) might play a role in the development of OC. These 4 DEGs and known OC-related genes might serve as therapeutic targets for OC.

a81da60cc6ba054cb475059a187e04157fc61e0a,Genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Korea.,"We conducted a genome-wide association study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a case-control study conducted in Korea. Incident childhood ALL cases (n=50) and non-cancer controls (n=50) frequency-matched to cases by age and sex, recruited from three teaching hospitals in Seoul between 2003 and 2008, were genotyped using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 platform. ALL risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for age and birth weight. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for adjusting multiple tests.

4eb119ec443e86201c97e5b85684940f5530712d,Effect of BRAF mutational status on expression profiles in conventional papillary thyroid carcinomas,"BackgroundWhereas 40 % to 70 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) are characterized by a BRAF mutation (BRAFmut), unified biomarkers for the genetically heterogeneous group of BRAF wild type (BRAFwt) PTCs are not established yet. Using state-of-the-art technology we compared RNA expression profiles between conventional BRAFwt and BRAFmut PTCs.MethodsMicroarrays covering 36,079 reference sequences were used to generate whole transcript expression profiles in 11 BRAFwt PTCs including five micro PTCs, 14 BRAFmut PTCs, and 7 normal thyroid specimens. A p-value with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change > 2 were used as a threshold of significance for differential expression. Network and pathway utilities were employed to interpret significance of expression data. BRAF mutational status was established by direct sequencing the hotspot region of exon 15.ResultsWe identified 237 annotated genes that were significantly differentially expressed between BRAFwt and BRAFmut PTCs. Of these, 110 genes were down- and 127 were upregulated in BRAFwt compared to BRAFmut PTCs. A number of molecules involved in thyroid hormone metabolism including thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were differentially expressed between both groups. Among cancer-associated molecules were ERBB3 that was downregulated and ERBB4 that was upregulated in BRAFwt PTCs. Two microRNAs were significantly differentially expressed of which miR492 bears predicted functions relevant to thyroid-specific molecules. The protein kinase A (PKA) and the G protein-coupled receptor pathways were identified as significantly related signaling cascades to the gene set of 237 genes. Furthermore, a network of interacting molecules was predicted on basis of the differentially expressed gene set.ConclusionsThe expression study focusing on affected genes that are differentially expressed between BRAFwt and BRAFmut conventional PTCs identified a number of molecules which are connected in a network and affect important canonical pathways. The identified gene set adds to our understanding of the tumor biology of BRAFwt and BRAFmut PTCs and contains genes/biomarkers of interest.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hans-Juergen Schulten"", ids = ""6162809""); list(name = ""Reem Alotibi"", ids = ""5549714""); list(name = ""Alaa Alahmadi"", ids = ""2059303""); list(name = ""Manar Ata"", ids = ""46777140""); list(name = ""Sajjad Karim"", ids = ""39221272""); list(name = ""Etimad A.

9a951efe9cbf3d44a7a7b77fe96d56f3b12dfdb4,Germline predictors of androgen deprivation therapy response in advanced prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate whether germline variations in genes involved in sex steroid biosynthesis and metabolic pathways predict time to treatment failure for patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), because there are few known clinical predictors of response.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
In a cohort of 304 patients with advanced prostate cancer undergoing ADT, we genotyped 746 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 72 genes from germline DNA (680 tagSNPs from 58 genes and 66 candidate SNPs from 20 genes [6 genes common in both]). Association with the primary end point of time to ADT failure was assessed using proportional hazards regression models at the gene level (for genes with tagging SNPs) and at the SNP level. False discovery rates (FDRs) of 0.10 or less were considered noteworthy to account for multiple testing.


RESULTS
At the gene level, TRMT11 showed the strongest association with time to ADT failure (P<.001; FDR=0.008). Two of 4 TRMT11 tagSNPs were associated with time to ADT failure. Median time to ADT failure for rs1268121 (A>G) was 3.05 years for the AA, 4.27 years for the AG, and 6.22 years for the GG genotypes (P=.002), and for rs6900796 (G>A), it was 2.42 years for the GG, 3.52 years for the AG, and 4.18 years for the AA genotypes (P<.001). No other gene level or SNP level tests had an FDR of 0.10 or less.


CONCLUSION
Genetic variation in TRMT11 was associated with time to ADT failure. Confirmation of these preliminary findings in an independent cohort is needed.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Manish Kohli"", ids = ""144503041""); list(name = ""Shaun M.

91387f4f23e502749058673a10ba875099f1e261,An activity-maintaining sequential protein extraction method for bioactive assay and proteome analysis of velvet antlers.,"The exceptional growth rate of velvet antler makes it a valuable model for studying the development of tissues, such as blood vessels, cartilage and bone. Meanwhile, investigating the activities of extracted proteins from velvet antlers promisingly leads to the discovery of new active factors which regulate the development of above-mentioned tissue types. In this study, a novel sequential protein extraction method was developed for proteome profiling and bioactivity study of velvet antlers. Herein, four antler growing tips were pooled to create a proportional pooled sample, and three aliquots of which were extracted in parallel using the developed extraction method. For each sample, proteins were extracted sequentially by saline solvent (0.15M sodium chloride, pH 7.0), mild acid buffer (0.15M acetate buffer, pH 4.0) and mild alkaline buffer (0.15M glycine-sodium hydroxide buffer, pH 10.0) with good bio-compatibility to prevent proteins denaturation. Then STD lysis buffer, containing 4% SDS, 0.1M Tris-HCl and 0.1M DTT, was used to extract hydrophobic proteins. The tryptic digest of each fraction was analyzed by nanoRPLC-ESI-MS/MS in triplicates, with false discovery rate for peptide identification adjusted to 1% to create filtered protein group list. In total, 1423 protein groups were identified, which expanded up to 3 times of the previous published dataset. The relative standard deviation of identified peptide and protein group number for all analyses indicated the good reproducibility of the developed sequential protein extraction method. Additionally, proteins extracted by acid buffer and alkaline buffer showed obvious promoting effect on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. All these results demonstrate that the developed sequential extraction method is efficient for the comprehensive proteome analysis and activity investigation of velvet antlers.",2013,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Zhigang Sui"", ids = ""5836961""); list(name = ""Huiming Yuan"", ids = ""6631309""); list(name = ""Zhen Liang"", ids = ""143741147""); list(name = ""Qun Zhao"", ids = ""144089821""); list(name = ""Qi Wu"", ids = ""145872440""); list(name = ""Simin Xia"", ids = ""6563282""); list(name = ""Lihua Zhang"", ids = ""153824181""); list(name = ""Yushu Huo"", ids = ""15497895""); list(name = ""Yu-kui Zhang"", ids = ""87577229"")",4e410f28bc3d00cbdff7694e1d7586d5897a18df; 2cba63b5bf757aef1c22c4a309e18f1bf05520de; 77b5bdd2531d3dd2e791f364d956c6f70d14203c; 8bb8940fba968b49f43b7a19ff16ec5a4ec777b9; 9d19f3fd04af4b66ffb0c81838d906b14eb5e033; 0eee2499f6d4a74acc8739993f4d4e24f87c8b47; 51702b7962dbf5d0129fa240906817635bfcfd18; 416b6f7994c0c2508bb9a76868e5ef045cca82a6; afb61fe01ddb286ba313bc9ac15af3b98d0e2e62; 8340097954a4257febff0ac853cb26ba09c2060a,,Talanta,107,"

In this study we performed microarray analysis to characterize the gene expression profile of leiomyoma and matched myometrial smooth muscle cells (LSMC and MSMC, respectively) in response to the time-dependent action of TGF-Î² and, after pretreatment with TGF-Î² type II receptor (TGF-Î²RII) antisense oligomer-blocking/reducing TGF-Î² autocrine/paracrine actions. Unsupervised and supervised assessments of the gene expression values with a false discovery rate selected at P â‰¤ 0.001 identified 310 genes as differentially expressed and regulated in LSMC and MSMC in a cell- and time-dependent manner by TGF-Î². Pretreatment with TGF-Î²RII antisense resulted in changes in the expression of many of the 310 genes regulated by TGF-Î², with 54 genes displaying a response to TGF-Î² treatment.

Synthetic hexaploid wheats (SHWs) exhibit natural genetic variation for resistance and/or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Stripe rust caused by (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst), is an important disease of wheat worldwide. To characterise loci conferring resistance to stripe rust in SHWs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a panel of 181 SHWs using the wheat 9 K SNP iSelect array. The SHWs were evaluated for their response to the prevailing races of Pst at the seedling and adult plant stages, the latter in replicated field trials at two sites in Ethiopia in 2011. About 28% of the SHWs exhibited immunity at the seedling stage while 56% and 83% were resistant to Pst at the adult plant stage at Meraro and Arsi Robe, respectively. A total of 27 SNPs in nine genomic regions (1 BS, 2 AS, 2 BL, 3 BL, 3 DL, 5A, 5 BL, 6DS and 7A) were linked with resistance to Pst at the seedling stage, while 38 SNPs on 18 genomic regions were associated with resistance at the adult plant stage. Six genomic regions were commonly detected at both locations using a mixed linear model corrected for population structure, kinship relatedness and adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR). The loci on chromosome regions 1 AS, 3 DL, 6 DS and 7 AL appeared to be novel QTL; our results confirm that resynthesized wheat involving its progenitor species is a rich source of new stripe (yellow) rust resistance that may be useful in choosing SHWs and incorporating diverse yellow rust (YR) resistance loci into locally adapted wheat cultivars.",2014,Biology;

Objective: We hypothesize that certain microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA interactions are associated with malignant transformation and progression of MM. To date, no integrated analysis has been performed to identify mechanistic interactions between miRNA-mRNA that may drive the malignant phenotype.

Method: Total RNA was extracted from 24 specimens of biopsy proven human MM and 6 specimens of normal pleura. Paired global transcriptional profiles of miRNA and genes (mRNA) expression were generated using Illumina microarrays. To optimize detection of causal associations, Spearman correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression were calculated among MM samples. Correlation p-values were converted to false discovery rates (FDR q-values) to account for multiple comparisons; associations with q<=0.05 were considered significant. To better determine the genes of relevance for a given process, sets of genes whose expression levels negatively correlated with specific miRNAs were identified as likely direct targets of that miRNA. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to find target gene sets that were significantly repressed or overexpressed in MM vs normal in the opposite direction to expression of the miRNA itself. Independent data sets were interrogated with GSEA to refine target gene sets whose behavior was consistent across the data and identify which were associated with patient survival. Associations of mRNA expression levels and disease-specific survival were evaluated by univariate Cox proportional hazard regression.

Result: We found multiple miRNA (total = 16) showing negative correlation in expression to multiple genes, and having the opposite expression pattern in MM vs normal compared to their putative targets. We arrived at this total by assessing the association between gene expression and outcome (disease-specific survival), and retaining only miRNA whose targets were significant (q<0.05). An example: expression of miR-192 (highly expressed in lung cancer) negatively correlated with expression of 156 mRNA (FDR<0.05). This miRNA was expressed 4-fold more in MM (FDR<0.01), while its gene targets showed an opposite pattern, being repressed in MM (FDR<0.001 in independent data). Functional annotation of target genes showed that they were enriched for targets of the Polycomb complex gene Ezh2, and for genes that are downregulated by KRAS in lung cancer. High expression of the genes negatively-correlated with miR-192 associated with better overall survival in an independent dataset, indicating that high expression of this miRNA affects poorer patient outcomes.

Conclusion: Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in MM revealed novel miRNA associated with MM and identified putative interactions that may underlie the malignant phenotype. These miRNA-mRNA are candidates for functional validation. miR-192 is a putative oncogenic miRNA in MM.

In this study, we used RNA-Seq and MS-based proteomics to accurately map coding sequences, transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcript 3'-ends (T3Es). We used obtained data to investigate roles of TSSs and T3Es in stress-induced transcriptional responses. We identified 1061 TSSs at a false discovery rate of 10% and showed that almost all transcription in M. gallisepticum is initiated from classic TATAAT promoters surrounded by A/T-rich sequences. Our analysis revealed the pronounced operon structure complexity: on average, each coding operon has one internal TSS and T3Es in addition to the primary ones. Our transcriptomic approach based on the intervals between the two nearest transcript ends allowed us to identify two classes of T3Es: strong, unregulated, hairpin-containing T3Es and weak, heat shock-regulated, hairpinless T3Es. Comparing gene expression levels under different conditions revealed widespread and divergent transcription regulation in M. gallisepticum. Modeling suggested that the core promoter structure plays an important role in gene expression regulation. We have shown that the heat stress activation of cryptic promoters combined with the hairpinless T3Es suppression leads to widespread, seemingly non-functional transcription.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pavel V.

0adc2bd94e8145146e8e4373dc8b10b28d720b8f,Principal Component Analysis of Proteome,"The goal of this study is to use principal component analysis (PCA) for multivariate analysis of proteome dynamics based on both protein abundance and turnover information generated by high-resolution mass spectrometry. We previously reported assessing protein dynamics in iron-starved Mycobacterium tuberculosis, revealing interesting interconnection among the cellular processes involving protein synthesis, degradation, and secretion (Anal. Chem. 80, 6860-9). In this study, we use target-decoy database search approach to select peptides for quantitation at a false discovery rate of 4.2%. We further use PCA to reduce the data dimensions for simpler interpretation. The PCA results indicate that the protein turnover and relative abundance properties are approximately orthogonal in the data space defined by the first three principal components. We show the potential of the Hotellingâ€™s T2 (T2) value as a quantifiable index for comparing changes between protein functional categories. The T2 value represents the gross change of a protein in both abundance and turnover. Close examination of the antigen 85 complex demonstrates that T2 correctly predicts the coordinated changes of the antigen 85 complex proteins. The multi-dimensional protein dynamics data further reveal the secretion of the antigen 85 complex. Overall, this study demonstrates PCA as an effective means to facilitate interpretation of the multivariate proteome dynamics dataset which otherwise would remain a significant challenge using traditional methods.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Prahlad Rao"", ids = ""144361141""); list(name = ""Qingbo Li"", ids = ""34703252"")",b149b43f09ef718869546266b1a96d363d5a7de4; 5fbe4419e126cf345e5d91fc831d135d2bd32cca; ac5a155223c1a8bad638da196f0688c822ef1f0a,,,,

To shed light on the neural and cognitive mechanisms of ASD, we investigated the association between peripheral cytokine levels and cognitive profiles in children with ASD. The serum levels of 10 cytokines (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon (IFN)-Î³, interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-Î±) were examined in 14 children with ASD using the Human Ultrasensitive Cytokine Magnetic 10-Plex Panel for the Luminex platform. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) was administered to each subject, and the relationships between WISC scores and serum levels of the cytokines were examined. The full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was significantly negatively correlated with the levels of IL-6 (Spearman's rank, p < 0.0001, false discovery rate q < 0.01). The levels of IL-6 and IFN-Î³ showed significant negative correlations with the verbal comprehension index (p < 0.001, q < 0.01) and working memory index (p < 0.01, q < 0.05), respectively. No other cytokines were significantly correlated with full-scale IQ or with any of the subscale scores of the WISC. The present results suggest negative correlations of IL-6 and IFN-Î³ levels with cognitive development of children with ASD. Our preliminary findings add to the evidence that cytokines may play a role in the neural development in ASD.",2017,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Daimei Sasayama"", ids = ""4339709""); list(name = ""Kana Kurahashi"", ids = ""5903718""); list(name = ""Kayoko Oda"", ids = ""50281355""); list(name = ""Takehiko Yasaki"", ids = ""3864000""); list(name = ""Yoshiyuki Yamada"", ids = ""2371093""); list(name = ""Nobuhiro Sugiyama"", ids = ""35215019""); list(name = ""Yuji Inaba"", ids = ""80466249""); list(name = ""Yuzuru Harada"", ids = ""2335254""); list(name = ""Shinsuke Washizuka"", ids = ""6727842""); list(name = ""Hideo Honda"", ids = ""47034126"")",cc59be4c8e21e222bb6c1c67b8d6ef65dae945d2,d7acedc3225c91e4321c70528e2fd1d290b24d96; 6982652dd3cc4349292f7b0f10297eb1b0bf7693; 518211cb5014e51858d5d300b1f517f603c5edc7; 447ea1b4eae15efd17e35393f56948dae6356f8e; 4b4543f1b22d1c62b3b97ad684de58bc7c4288c3; 9e285a857729783232f09d9bc98e59767af0e2eb; bce68e1e810d0384aa8e9728a1c7bdb45bc9d8e4; 0968244e20690fac00c1b406db32549f7ce796c6; 25da4842a91a7a705eb0d2c43b466e406317d1a4; 6de3869fe4a3893b23e69d9bb18832fa82bb169c; 7f0096979aa3edb98a8a7786a73062f9ca71e334; 7f43e7b6f29596889f6e3d08ce393897daa8b640; eedbd9feb834819f34cdbd432392e62d288aeddb; d71e3c81dcbc9a2759dbaef1b5ccd6d8fe2030c3; 6b65f29b1f3e196a0fc3804e97de41af0dbaa4fa; 26be64ef6ee845603de3441298c4db38d8353030; 17f2f431be2c8031c0c8649e7645b246020ddca1; aafc10e64ce55b5d07ffa19756278a30e5f5eb83; 550a8f8b7fa955fe85197072ea4d5a5ab71b8218; 932e78adc11605b8b4295713ccc08ca8eb4add4d; 7c84c831e7924c0f09aeb2cdf397993eaa4b6944; 85eec8458745887bc9d5480a73cb23b04c9dbc89; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 5922079c05c72e719a4459c9bbdb3a08bd222404; 736eb0604296d3f8f8ab1401f0387d23f208ff9e; 129e199462952e3b5f1612bbdbf55f170d6fb839; 9ef2056c187cc47843d8493c7c391e6d34ec140b; e2462cf2420458ec4e958decff4fa7bd6f98949a; 32004b6f2830e7302f6cc7d97e97a3686c2d0c26; fba04c4238016cc5267a0e847fe11f92260fb00f; f8bd8e5a7e5cd8a7d5c442d1880100174ae5d470; bc268550974e94686fd2f779af23993854961f79; cab20fb20d001cd0a7f328e89b55ba0826596259,Journal of Intelligence,5,

Outcomes of genome scans have been shown to 24 depend on several factors including the underlying demography, the adaptive 25 scenario, and the software or method used. We took advantage of a pedagogical 26 experiment carried out during a summer school to explore the effect of an unexplored 27 source of variability, which is the degree of user expertise. Participants were asked to 28 analyze three simulated data challenges with methods presented during the summer 29 school. In addition to submitting lists, participants evaluated a priori their level of 30 expertise. We measured the quality of each genome scan analysis by computing a 31 score that depends on false discovery rate and statistical power. In an easy and a 32 difficult challenge, less advanced participants obtained similar scores compared to 33 advanced ones, demonstrating that participants with little background in genome 34 scan methods were able to learn how to use complex software after short 35 introductory tutorials. However, in a challenge of intermediate difficulty, advanced 36 participants obtained better scores. To explain the difference, we introduce a 37 probabilistic model that shows that a larger variation in scores is expected for SNPs 38 of intermediate difficulty of detection. We conclude that practitioners should develop 39 their statistical and computational expertise to follow the development of complex 40 methods. To encourage training, we release the website of the summer school where 41 users can submit lists of candidate loci, which will be scored and compared to the 42 scores obtained by previous users. 43 44 .

We report here the first conotoxin that is able to inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis at a concentration similar to that of two other drugs that are currently used in clinics. Furthermore, it is also the first conopeptide that has been isolated from the venom of Conasprella ximenes. The venom gland transcriptome of C. ximenes was sequenced to construct a database with 24,284 non-redundant transcripts. The conopeptide was purified from the venom using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and was analyzed using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). No automatic identification above the identity threshold with 1% of the false discovery rate was obtained; however, a 10-amino-acid sequence tag, manually extracted from the MS/MS spectra, allowed for the identification of a conotoxin in the transcriptome database. Electron transfer higher energy collision dissociation (EThcD) fragmentation of the native conotoxin confirmed the N-terminal sequence (1-14), while LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic digest of the reduced and S-alkylated conotoxin confirmed the C-terminal region (15-36). The expected and experimental molecular masses corresponded, within sub-ppm mass error. The 37-mer peptide (MW 4109.69 Da), containing eight cysteine residues, was named I1_xm11a, according to the current nomenclature for this type of molecule.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrea Figueroa-Montiel"", ids = ""1423340709""); list(name = ""Johanna BernÃ¡ldez"", ids = ""3725956""); list(name = ""Samanta JimÃ©nez"", ids = ""35652135""); list(name = ""Beatrix Ueberhide"", ids = ""35625345""); list(name = ""Luis Javier GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""145688670""); list(name = ""Alexei Fedorovish Licea-Navarro"", ids = ""1390111710"")",a8ea8f8da864929ccb63acdf09e27bf2c673d93e; c8ef49c627979e85d572e5db47d006f4d5b13c78; 05712d785ebda8c0ca51a9cf9d821f603d3acb15; b610904ff9bb831fdb5602eb28e819846325258f; 8493924428f8ded0304e1974c00d6beb34d648c9,8a03084ed97b13cb6dfdd15f3b15b9942c1911c5; 64ac751a10391dde2637de19ca4482e21c99067a; 5f704438916f83f38a2296b8315e87f629b69c63; 9f602bede4f0b6efe688aead5129552234e9e14c; 1d4f4ad098ba2def03ba89f4acf2ce344981b9f4; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; 98b9d616ab65e0f76fa1ad4457e6a379826751ef; f5d329ea9cd9ea3767525efed8c881eef313e440; 0b51f501df0c06a0d491e49d684f0e79f6ad65f7; 6175802768549123295a9c5591aa3de6aae801bf; 0283c1dc41ffa3ad88db5c4b4ab25613cd096e3c; ba832e9bc406e4ae7cb8b7fddeb5c38007c753f6; 4e09cf2e449864c391918b538408355e53a7f17e; 1eb7cb80b5ab5f7cb66a24e07ccfa14dfa61a633; 34f9e724592940924bf77cf4747b6f2b9f5c38b3; 78f185e524a588a5177313dcca9f6fa18ce1f380; f3f6e1678e6c0c3a69714cedac0bdd640fd39c9e; 4f4879830a9e6fed88020b42df2a09f3c253b702; 06e2cbc70908ae9be9dfda41a8a11783bc3e606a; ba827540617fb238b10669ed193e9732d713f4b5; 3f3d554515a13cf5a58a53259fa2e04f1a3ac1ec; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; 8da5cef0b2f21944aa5efdf7dae77c220f02e37e; 4bcc5dae4e63b7b1ef09088a573f03e72a32eb87; 90e66567b741a7408b66c1ca4ae9af17ad116e4d; baef2572f363bd77cd0fac9557060ec73568bafa; 8afed9b352e5aa913debe676b08abca49c86cdfb; e87002c1589a37ea2daa7772159913d27203bbd9; f43cac36ea62a26031fdc504dbecb21139118adb; e7b8535cd1e01bf4e4865c19da77361e4a304a8f; a8310f17b306a14b774d427e60d6af04185e1d64; fda19f806886f2770895b96071281933399422f0; 4d99ff1ae041f661e967acb06f84b5e0a703a084; 67417dbddd6563c915bfec824342a46995acff9c; f4308e8ff61ba13f94accc1b0872ee33af6101ae; 3dfd54369d18ec60d82b74a4bc8a9d7653e2baab; 66a63d9ddde9db2693cd65aafac820c97dc276b8; be5262fd5ba0daa333b7678c5362de8f52f8e39f; 4aba04aa3ad3497b45b923d1505093d7dd473c96; 2905d5b64e80fb1379c4dae7114403d091b7abad; a5bf02902402d6c7b3c3791d01cd4c621d390547; 1c1488359d1e5eebe6bf22e9229b80e22ae9d47c; a206f5804c516ac94459585b1e1f1a5f5dc78dba; aa23178f90b931db78f50e1fa99a2e37be9300a3; d5e625ef03ef0c52d493be255a35fc64738c4192; df6cae103ed194cb45d666b04ee713569c5aa5af,Toxins,10,
47abf790cf950b315b72be5eda5171198cc3e5db,Microarray analyses reveal novel targets of exercise-induced stress resistance in the dorsal raphe nucleus,"Serotonin (5-HT) is implicated in the development of stress-related mood disorders in humans. Physical activity reduces the risk of developing stress-related mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In rats, 6 weeks of wheel running protects against stress-induced behaviors thought to resemble symptoms of human anxiety and depression. The mechanisms by which exercise confers protection against stress-induced behaviors, however, remain unknown. One way by which exercise could generate stress resistance is by producing plastic changes in gene expression in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The DRN has a high concentration of 5-HT neurons and is implicated in stress-related mood disorders. The goal of the current experiment was to identify changes in the expression of genes that could be novel targets of exercise-induced stress resistance in the DRN. Adult, male F344 rats were allowed voluntary access to running wheels for 6 weeks; exposed to inescapable stress or no stress; and sacrificed immediately and 2 h after stressor termination. Laser capture micro dissection selectively sampled the DRN. mRNA expression was measured using the whole genome Affymetrix microarray. Comprehensive data analyses of gene expression included differential gene expression, log fold change (LFC) contrast analyses with False Discovery Rate correction, KEGG and Wiki Web Gestalt pathway enrichment analyses, and Weighted Gene Correlational Network Analysis (WGCNA). Our results suggest that physically active rats exposed to stress modulate expression of twice the number of genes, and display a more rapid and strongly coordinated response, than sedentary rats. Bioinformatics analyses revealed several potential targets of stress resistance including genes that are related to immune processes, tryptophan metabolism, and circadian/diurnal rhythms.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Alice Brianne Loughridge"", ids = ""6620222""); list(name = ""Benjamin N.

5a7c0330d09194ebb50cc55ecc707ffb293338d7,Abstract #1326: A genome-wide screen for DNA methylation-based colorectal cancer biomarkers: Discovery of new candidates and search for complementarity to Septin 9.,"Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths despite a survival rate of over 90% when detected early. Currently, less than half of guideline eligible individuals are screened regularly for CRC, highlighting a need for improved non-invasive methods of early detection. We previously identified and validated a blood-based biomarker, Septin 9, which identifies methylated DNA in plasma from all stages of CRC. We have now conducted a genome-wide screen to identify additional blood-based biomarkers that either augment the performance of Septin 9 for CRC detection or perform individually as well as Septin 9. Methods: Differential methylation hybridization (DMH) via customized high-density microarrays with >50,000 features was used to explore methylation differences between Septin 9 (-) CRC (n = 13), Septin 9 (+) CRC (n = 14), normal adjacent to tumor (NAT, n = 11) and whole blood (n = 8) DNA. Significant probesets were identified using a Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.25 and ranked by t statistic. The top 65 DMH and 62 literature candidates were chosen for real-time PCR assay development and validated using tissues from 51 Septin 9 (-) CRCs, 147 Septin 9 (+) CRCs, 8 NATs and 14 normal colon epithelia in addition to 94 other disease and normal tissues. Ten of these candidates were chosen for HMO assay development and the performances of the four most promising candidates were evaluated in plasma from 136 CRC patients and 170 colonoscopy-verified controls using a case-control study design. Results: 7026 statistically significant probesets for all CRC tissues versus NAT and whole blood and 7280 significant probesets for Septin 9 (+) CRC versus Septin 9 (-) CRC were identified. Comparison of the top 150 candidates for Septin 9 (-) CRC versus whole blood and versus Septin 9 (+) CRC yielded 224 unique candidates. Results of real-time PCR analysis validated 26 of 45 biomarker candidates, with significant overlap between those CRC tissues identified by Septin 9 and those identified by the new candidates (all Spearman R values > 0.48). Using HM real-time PCR analysis in DNA extracted from plasma, Septin 9 detected 85/136 CRC patients (63%) and 27/170 controls (16%). The four new biomarkers detected from 54/136 CRC patients (40%) to 74/136 CRC patients (54%) and from 18/170 controls (11%) to 42/170 controls (25%). Conclusions: By using a systematic screen, we identified 26 biomarkers that specifically discriminated CRC from normal colon tissues, although complementarity to Septin 9 was limited. Plasma-based, highly sensitive real-time PCR assays were successfully developed for four of these biomarkers. All biomarkers identified a similar subset of CRC patient plasmas, with slight variations in sensitivity and specificity. Septin 9 remains the best biomarker for maximizing sensitivity and specificity on plasma DNA. Citation Information: In: Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res; 2009 Apr 18-22; Denver, CO.

bd9ab830ff4a81b09d0d64fbf0dfd2a691a41580,Association mapping of oil content and fatty acid components in soybean,"Soybean is a globally important oil crop, and the flavour, stability and nutritional value of soybean oil is dependent on the relative proportions of five primary fatty acids. In this study, association mapping was performed to identify molecular markers associated with QTL regions related to oil traits in soybean. Oil and fatty acid contents were measured in soybean accessions grown under field conditions for 2Â years. Based on polymorphisms at 142 SSR loci, 94 soybean accessions were divided into two clusters corresponding to accessions from Asian and American gene pools. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the SSR loci suggested a structure across the soybean genome (LD decay) of approximately 12Â cM. Pairwise kinship estimates among the accessions showed low values. A mixed linear model (MLM) adjusted using false discovery rate (FDR) and minimum Bayes factor (BFmin) values identified 110 strongly associated marker-traits. Oleic acid content had the highest number of associated SSR loci (33), followed by linoleic acid (26), palmitic acid (24), oil (16) and linolenic acid (14). Specific alleles at eight loci yielded high performing soybeans with respect to fatty acid content, and these are presented in a crossing matrix. Analysis of SSR loci and oil traits confirmed previous findings, and many new markers were also identified that may be useful for quickly improving oil traits in soybean.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Regina Helena Geribello Priolli"", ids = ""3865717""); list(name = ""Jaqueline Bueno de Campos"", ids = ""46363383""); list(name = ""Nevio Stabellini"", ids = ""5025036""); list(name = ""JosÃ© B.

Due to the dependency of test statistics in pairwise comparisons, many conventional multiple testing procedures canâ€™t be employed directly. Some modified procedures that control FDR with dependent test statistics are too conservative. In the paper, by bootstrap and goodness-of-fit methods, we produce independent p-values for pairwise comparisons. Based on these independent p-values, plenty of procedures can be used, and two typical FDR controlling procedures are applied here. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed approach. Extensive simulations show the satisfactory FDR control and power performance of our approach. In addition, the proposed approach can be easily extended to more than two normal, or non-normal, balance or unbalance cases.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pei Jin"", ids = ""5231104""); list(name = ""Xingzhong Xu"", ids = ""1704059""); list(name = ""Na Li"", ids = ""50599175"")",,,"Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series",32,701-712
4d7b55f37414b10a32c6dcc49d55d2f72d3d81f0,Differential changes in gene expression in human brain during late first trimester and early second trimester of pregnancy.,"OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to describe brain development during the first (B1) and second trimester (B3) in human fetuses.


DESIGN
Ten brains from 10 to 18â€‰weeks of gestational age (GA) were collected, and the RNA was used for transcriptome analysis (Affymetrix 1.0 ST microarray chip). Differences in brain development within 10 to 18 GA were investigated by dividing the sample into 10 to 12 (B1), 13 to 15(B2) and 16 to 18(B3) weeks. A fold change of 2 or above, with a false discovery rate of 5%, was used as cut-off to determine differential gene expression for individual genes. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm differences. Tests for enrichment procedures (using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were then used to identify functional groups of mRNA.


RESULTS
At 10 to 12â€‰weeks, brains showed neuronal migration to be upregulated. From 10 to 18â€‰weeks, brains showed genes coding for neuronal migration, differentiation and connectivity upregulated. ALDH1A1 and NPY genes, marker of spinal cord and striatum, were upregulated in B1 and B3 brains, respectively. Also, SLITRK6-HAS2 and CRYAB-PCDH18 genes for ear and eye sensory input were upregulated in B1.


CONCLUSIONS
For the first time, brain global gene expression was described in human samples. Period B1 was dominated by genes coding for neuronal migration, differentiation, programmed cell death and sensory organs. B3 was dominated by neuronal proliferation, branching and myelination. Creating such a database will allow comparison with abnormals in future studies.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jesus Igor Iruretagoyena"", ids = ""10330537""); list(name = ""Wendy Davis"", ids = ""152916210""); list(name = ""Clark W.

5af2e36aaf812b5b44250419e6d41648c165dac7,Rare Variants Association Analysis in Large-Scale Sequencing Studies at the Single Locus Level,"Genetic association analyses of rare variants in next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are fundamentally challenging due to the presence of a very large number of candidate variants at extremely low minor allele frequencies. Recent developments often focus on pooling multiple variants to provide association analysis at the gene instead of the locus level. Nonetheless, pinpointing individual variants is a critical goal for genomic researches as such information can facilitate the precise delineation of molecular mechanisms and functions of genetic factors on diseases. Due to the extreme rarity of mutations and high-dimensionality, significances of causal variants cannot easily stand out from those of noncausal ones. Consequently, standard false-positive control procedures, such as the Bonferroni and false discovery rate (FDR), are often impractical to apply, as a majority of the causal variants can only be identified along with a few but unknown number of noncausal variants. To provide informative analysis of individual variants in large-scale sequencing studies, we propose the Adaptive False-Negative Control (AFNC) procedure that can include a large proportion of causal variants with high confidence by introducing a novel statistical inquiry to determine those variants that can be confidently dispatched as noncausal. The AFNC provides a general framework that can accommodate for a variety of models and significance tests. The procedure is computationally efficient and can adapt to the underlying proportion of causal variants and quality of significance rankings. Extensive simulation studies across a plethora of scenarios demonstrate that the AFNC is advantageous for identifying individual rare variants, whereas the Bonferroni and FDR are exceedingly over-conservative for rare variants association studies. In the analyses of the CoLaus dataset, AFNC has identified individual variants most responsible for gene-level significances. Moreover, single-variant results using the AFNC have been successfully applied to infer related genes with annotation information.",2016,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""X.

The speed of data generation is astonishingâ€”from now until 2020, the volume of the digital data is expected to approximately double every two years, and 90% of the data available to us today were generated in just the last two years. Specifically in biological and biomedical research fields, we have witnessed the rapid advances in biotechnologies, especially the next-generation sequencing and single cell technologies, enabling the investigators to create massive amounts of data for genomics and translational research. While analysis of the data from single domain like mutations or gene expression is often the first choice in a project, integrative genomic approaches have more advantages such as robustness in detecting the biological signals or biomarkers and low false discovery rates due to the evidence from multiple domains. Therefore, we have steadily seen more integrative genomic studies during the past several years. Although these approaches are promising and powerful, there are many challenges that are required to be addressed by bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and other scientists.

Our primary aim was to verify that 2D:4D sex-specifically relates to life expectancy and suicide numbers on a national level (23 countries). We also used a hypothesis-free approach to investigate associations with other causes of death [p value adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate procedure (FDR)]. All parameters were normalized to the national mean (of males and females) and analyzed across nations. Normalized male 2D:4D correlated positively with normalized male life expectancy (at birth, rÂ =Â 0.46, pÂ =Â 0.029; at the age of 60, rÂ =Â 0.44, pÂ =Â 0.038) and negatively with normalized male suicide rates (rÂ =Â âˆ’Â 0.49, pÂ =Â 0.017). In the exploratory analyses, the normalized male 2D:4D values were negatively associated with the normalized male deaths rates from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions [rÂ =Â âˆ’Â 0.65, p(FDR)Â =Â 0.011], respiratory infections [rÂ =Â âˆ’Â 0.69, p(FDR)Â =Â 0.008], asthma [rÂ =Â âˆ’Â 0.65, p(FDR)Â =Â 0.011], neurological conditions [rÂ =Â âˆ’Â 0.56, p(FDR)Â =Â 0.046], and Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other dementias [rÂ =Â âˆ’Â 0.59, p(FDR)Â =Â 0.036]. The normalized female parameters showed the same cross-national correlations. In line with the previous individual level findings, the results suggest that prenatal sex hormone effects are sex-specifically involved in suicide and neurological conditions. Moreover, we provide novel national level evidence that prenatal sex hormone priming may sex-specifically influence life expectancy and death risk from respiratory diseases.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bernd Lenz"", ids = ""2315744""); list(name = ""Johannes Kornhuber"", ids = ""2706880"")",8e6d8bdadadec71df4f948246b50e9b9f16cf72e; 0d0d21c8504e6d3c3d288308913e03fdca76db20; 7788030e605e84eaf6d5e317cb81aa15492d4fbf; c2e5067ace57c36c85539752ee8f747465b3b2d8; fcf627a63febe53ca40c39dc1444acf54718f14c; 5598213077e5c85e39c8ccf495af4f8fff0f943e; a65461aa62776546fecef960337d7142f3621cdd,65406a5a118628a16d8fd15fddf803ecc545feab; eeb696d162c45df96810c34cf6c2d2bc49276118; 83a709be5c10d0f358726ada9d8575c7e03c12d1; 7e2dec0402577a34a8574a0103dfe62f28b34553; 5e3726040fa77c3e2186d1fa4fd81bd26dbbb4b5; d75048eff1b34a8743461ce63b8f0aec6d2c1a69; 8dc4e87b080caaad6f5dab2f1a094f5445e32636; 3326f9b903173dfdbcd5064534ec603a0660b963; 58cbdf0f292bc96a7bbb3be57b70e26e78f5e8d2; 53c6d37581853c1b6136808f0e39cbb1270ab258; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; bfbef02da7c9c0e2ff6fcaf5fca12cbdd2550c8e; 960d1a4ec3aa2432b4ee5565868f409e8e6eb931; e4c56223acaa13cf100ea586e934606be63392c0; b29bd6203287c1f5fc020d2745574010bc1f9d58; a3451ec5d6ced1a143bc2f4d562333d6fcf8a729; f4022bd144a21493ef2fb794e04dc5ea69a09d9f; 6dd42f5d2db83a0cd03d06cad831576a952e8579; 46cd70241298fed61bac32bb81fe6a5b2d44b8f7; dbc37e39faeb22709fefcd925004c8940f45f3b3; 1dc5b2114d1ff561fc7d6163d8f4e9c905ca12c4; faa8bfe83ac595b00679344488b44352d212f05d; b9b4b647ad45177b03be56b6624142aac81f0039; 159796b589f6ca82e19bc0e8bad64c710df2d1bf; b3eacff9d538d76a21cdcfcd08cdbe039940d080; 0165b0c7d18555231f97aba25b767aa95b84e988; b37a854086497205cd969c74bde8da70dd935198; ec811db47ae853bfa761de535e2491755a47816b; 3bfb3470966c28a055f2f5a1c4e3cf3fc4fea86e; 674a98ecf91313cc7c50c6908de3756e87145593; 236f63d499e9b659fe1e200f6794c94974db0565; c28ac5262b781a191ec459da240a63c10d19e193; 3a88038be8c6ab60d5c6c6e7f8b2f34b00785864; 5fd1fa9f56ee09d3e894f8647c710b1a27ec2de2; 49afb5d1a2ae8a0b3f26da0775c9278871ba92d5; f07bd1117813ed0e1b086d4efbd6646b6385c5bc; 43ddedaf25dfe5b0d43a69ce5edb492d6e48c42c; 8516cd85e08c87638d03cd654d76d0b4057058f7; 8a1af56f31a336d2b6649cffaf007f513c548131; 1e344e8cc389027ec97778f25460f328b8d15e28; 7f959866f5edff77f9cc8f9b6fb08eeb4e91a98c; 16a5b69695f1ce0c2613a4590bdfeef82460d911; 6352c474ed99aa805d171f5b04a844e0edeea764; 59203388dddc1e9a4405c511c506e71c2d7a63ea; 56b67135776b02705560570eb424ae9c217f1365; c775697e0e05d6dea3b9d718b2ffc48607e3ddbd; 32f218041873fabed20ce93a86f172d779b9afae,Journal of Neural Transmission,125,239 - 246

No clinical data are available on the effect of pregnancy on RANK/RANKL expression in young breast cancer patients.MethodsWe used our previously published dataset of 65 pregnant and 130 matched young breast cancer patients with full clinical, pathological, and survival information. 85% of patients had available transcriptomic data as well. RANK/RANKL expression by immunohistochemistry using H-score on the primary tumor and adjacent normal tissue was performed. We examined the difference in expression of RANK/RANKL between pregnant and non-pregnant patients and their association with clinicopathological features and prognosis. We also evaluated genes and pathways associated with RANK/RANKL expression on primary tumors.ResultsRANKL but not RANK expression was more prevalent in the pregnant group, both on the tumor and adjacent normal tissue, independent of other clinicopathological factors (both P <0.001). 18.7% of pregnant and 5.3% of non-pregnant patients had tumors showing â‰¥10% of cells with 3+ RANKL expression. RANKL expression was significantly higher in progesterone receptor-positive, and luminal A-like tumors, with negative correlation with Ki-67 (all P <0.001). On the contrary, RANK expression was higher in triple negative tumors (P <0.001). Using false discovery rate <0.05, 151 and 1,207 genes were significantly correlated with tumor-expressed RANKL and RANK expression by immunohistochemistry, respectively. High RANKL expression within primary tumor was associated with pathways related to mammary gland development, bone resorption, T-cell proliferation and regulation of chemotaxis, while RANK expression was associated with immune response and proliferation pathways. At a median follow-up of 65Â months, neither RANK nor RANKL expression within tumor was associated with disease free survival in pregnant or non-pregnant group.ConclusionsPregnancy increases RANKL expression both in normal breast and primary tumors. These results could guide further development of RANKL-targeted therapy.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hatem A.

c5a2143d14245971b12a54dc4cbbeb39fee7db81,Activation of Î²-catenin signaling in androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells.,"PURPOSE
To study Wnt/Î²-catenin in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and understand its function independently of the Î²-catenin-androgen receptor (AR) interaction.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We carried out Î²-catenin immunocytochemical analysis, evaluated TOP-flash reporter activity (a reporter of Î²-catenin-mediated transcription), and sequenced the Î²-catenin gene in MDA prostate cancer 118a, MDA prostate cancer 118b, MDA prostate cancer 2b, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. We knocked down Î²-catenin in AR-negative MDA prostate cancer 118b cells and carried out comparative gene-array analysis. We also immunohistochemically analyzed Î²-catenin and AR in 27 bone metastases of human CRPCs.


RESULTS
Î²-Catenin nuclear accumulation and TOP-flash reporter activity were high in MDA prostate cancer 118b but not in MDA prostate cancer 2b or PC-3 cells. MDA prostate cancer 118a and MDA prostate cancer 118b cells carry a mutated Î²-catenin at codon 32 (D32G). Ten genes were expressed differently (false discovery rate, 0.05) in MDA prostate cancer 118b cells with downregulated Î²-catenin. One such gene, hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), synthesizes hyaluronan, a core component of the extracellular matrix. We confirmed HAS2 upregulation in PC-3 cells transfected with D32G-mutant Î²-catenin. Finally, we found nuclear localization of Î²-catenin in 10 of 27 human tissue specimens; this localization was inversely associated with AR expression (P = 0.056, Fisher's exact test), suggesting that reduced AR expression enables Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.


CONCLUSION
We identified a previously unknown downstream target of Î²-catenin, HAS2, in prostate cancer, and found that high Î²-catenin nuclear localization and low or no AR expression may define a subpopulation of men with bone metastatic prostate cancer.

e7c84600f145b189cce2f9dafd1635660a4b8c7e,"Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes APOE and TOMM40, and brain white matter integrity in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936â˜†","Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ genotype has previously been significantly associated with cognitive, brain imaging, and Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes (e.g., age of onset). In the TOMM40 gene, the rs10524523 (""523"") variable length poly-T repeat polymorphism has more recently been associated with similar ph/enotypes, although the allelic directions of these associations have varied between initial reports. Using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography, the present study aimed to investigate whether there are independent effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TOMM40 genotypes on human brain white matter integrity in a community-dwelling sample of older adults, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (mean age = 72.70 years, standard deviation = 0.74, N approximately = 640-650; for most analyses). Some nominally significant effects were observed (i.e., covariate-adjusted differences between genotype groups at p < 0.05). For APOE, deleterious effects of Îµ4 ""risk"" allele presence (vs. absence) were found in the right ventral cingulum and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. To test for biologically independent effects of the TOMM40 523 repeat, participants were stratified into APOE genotype subgroups, so that any significant effects could not be attributed to APOE variation. In participants with the APOE Îµ3/Îµ4 genotype, effects of TOMM40 523 status were found in the left uncinate fasciculus, left rostral cingulum, left ventral cingulum, and a general factor of white matter integrity. In all 4 of these tractography measures, carriers of the TOMM40 523 ""short"" allele showed lower white matter integrity when compared with carriers of the ""long"" and ""very-long"" alleles. Most of these effects survived correction for childhood intelligence test scores and vascular disease history, though only the effect of TOMM40 523 on the left ventral cingulum integrity survived correction for false discovery rate. The effects of APOE in this older population are more specific and restricted compared with those reported in previous studies, and the effects of TOMM40 on white matter integrity appear to be novel, although replication is required in large independent samples.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Donald M.

643dc1fcfc1985e5c9281130b720881277a89a53,Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity Among Multiple Myeloma Patients Subsequently Treated with Proteasome Inhibitor Therapy,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular (CV) events are a known complication to proteasome inhibitor therapy in myeloma. Underlying mechanisms are unknown. We recently completed an investigator initiated, single institution Phase II study of high dose carfilzomib (56mg/m2) in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (NCT01351623). Among 42 response evaluable patients, 11 patients (25%) developed treatment-emergent heart failure of any grade, and 5 patients (11%) developed severe heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We undertook a study to identify potential biomarkers that may point to underlying mechanisms of CV events among multiple myeloma patients treated with carfilzomib therapy. METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study with 7 patients who experienced a CV event on our high dose carfilzomib study and had pre-treatment (baseline) plasma stored and 19 case matched controls treated on the same study who did not have a CV event. We screened for 90 proteins known to be associated with CV disease using O-linked glycosylation. We used the Proseek Multiplex CVD I 96x96 platform which is based on the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) technique. PEA is a 96-plex immunoassay that allows high throughput detection of protein biomarkers in liquid samples. For each biomarker, a matched pair of antibodies linked to unique oligonucleotides (proximity probes) binds to the respective protein target. Upon binding, the unique proximity probes can hybridize to each other and subsequently be detected and quantified by real-time PCR. Mean biomarker levels were compared using a t-test. False discovery rate (FDR) was used for multiple comparisons adjustment. RESULTS: Using samples collected prior to initiation of carfilzomib therapy, in an agnostic statistical model we identified the following four proteins to have altered levels in myeloma patients who developed CV events (p=0.002-0.004, unadjusted; p=0.089, after FDR correction): matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and myoglobin (MB). Myeloma patients who developed CV events had 37% lower MMP-1, 15% lower MB, and 4% lower HB-EGF, while TRAIL was 7% higher in patients who developed CV events. Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of proteolytic enzymes responsible, among other functions, for myocardial extracellular protein degradation. Interestingly, several MMP species, including MMP-1, have been identified within the human myocardium and are thought to be dysregulated in congestive heart failure. HB-EGF is a mitogenic and chemotactic glycoprotein that is essential for maintaining normal cardiac function and is known to play an important role in myocardial remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: We found that there was a trend towards lower MMP-1, HB-EGF, and MB levels and higher TRAIL levels in patients with CV events while receiving proteasome therapy. MMP-1 appears to be the most promising potential biomarker based on our data. Our study supports further investigation of these proteins as potential biomarkers for patients at risk of CV events when treated with carfilzomib. 1. Proteins are listed based on the p-value associated with the difference between patients who did and did not have CV events, with lowest p-value on the top. The top 10 biomarkers are shown.

f4799a25cf040f579567a051acaed4a13abbab73,ProteinExplorer: A Repository-Scale Resource for Exploration of Protein Detection in Public Mass Spectrometry Data Sets.,"High-throughput tandem mass spectrometry has enabled the detection and identification of over 75% of all proteins predicted to result in translated gene products in the human genome. In fact, the galloping rate of data acquisition and sharing of mass spectrometry data has led to the current availability of many tens of terabytes of public data in thousands of human data sets. The systematic reanalysis of these public data sets has been used to build a community-scale spectral library of 2.1 million precursors for over 1 million unique sequences from over 19,000 proteins (including spectra of synthetic peptides). However, it has remained challenging to find and inspect spectra of peptides covering functional protein regions or matching novel proteins. ProteinExplorer addresses these challenges with an intuitive interface mapping tens of millions of identifications to functional sites on nearly all human proteins while maintaining provenance for every identification back to the original data set and data file. Additionally, ProteinExplorer facilitates the selection and inspection of HPP-compliant peptides whose spectra can be matched to spectra of synthetic peptides and already includes HPP-compliant evidence for 107 missing (PE2, PE3, and PE4) and 23 dubious (PE5) proteins. Finally, ProteinExplorer allows users to rate spectra and to contribute to a community library of peptides entitled PrEdict (Protein Existance dictionary) mapping to novel proteins but whose preliminary identities have not yet been fully established with community-scale false discovery rates and synthetic peptide spectra.

Premierement, une nouvelle classe de procedures avec ponderation donnees-dependante, avec une structure de groupe et des estimateurs de la proportion de vraies nulles, est definie, et controle le False Discovery Rate (FDR) asymptotiquement. Cette procedure atteint aussi l'optimalite en puissance sous certaines conditions sur les estimateurs. Deuxiemement, de nouvelles procedures step-up et step-down, adaptees aux tests discrets sous independance, sont concues pour controler le FDR pour une distribution arbitraire des marginales des p-valeurs sous l'hypothese nulle. Finalement, de nouvelles familles de reference pour l'inference post hoc, adaptees pour le cas ou le signal est localise, sont etudiees, et on calcule les bornes post hoc associees avec un algorithme simple.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Guillermo AndrÃ©s Durand"", ids = ""77212328"")",,,,,

Genome-wide linkage (GWL) data from several studies of neuroticism and anxiety disorders have been published, providing an opportunity to test such hypotheses and identify genomic regions that harbor genes common to these phenotypes. In all, 11 independent GWL studies of either neuroticism (n=8) or anxiety disorders (n=3) were collected, which comprised of 5341 families with 15â€‰529 individuals. The rank-based genome scan meta-analysis (GSMA) approach was used to analyze each trait separately and combined, and global correlations between results were examined. False discovery rate (FDR) analysis was performed to test for enrichment of significant effects. Using 10â€‰cM intervals, bins nominally significant for both GSMA statistics, PSR and POR, were found on chromosomes 9, 11, 12, and 14 for neuroticism and on chromosomes 1, 5, 15, and 16 for anxiety disorders. Genome-wide, the results for the two phenotypes were significantly correlated, and a combined analysis identified additional nominally significant bins. Although none reached genome-wide significance, an excess of significant PSRP-values were observed, with 12 bins falling under a FDR threshold of 0.50. As demonstrated by our identification of multiple, consistent signals across the genome, meta-analytically combining existing GWL data is a valuable approach to narrowing down regions relevant for anxiety-related phenotypes. This may prove useful for prioritizing emerging genome-wide association data for anxiety disorders.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bradley Todd Webb"", ids = ""1937889""); list(name = ""An-Yuan Guo"", ids = ""2871738""); list(name = ""Brion S.

0323023c60b7da19896ea6c7d0ccf19c8213a83e,Statistical colocalization in biological imaging with false discovery control,"In this paper, we present a novel object-based statistical colocalization method. Our colocalization relies on multiple hypothesis tests on the distances between all pairs of the (spot-shaped) objects from the two markers. We wish to test among all these pairs how many are significantly close to each other such that they cannot occur just ""by chance"". Two objects are decided to be co-localized if the test on their distance is significant. For this purpose, we first extract the objects by applying a wavelet-based spot detection approach which fully takes into account the mixed-Poisson-Gaussian noise process of confocal fluorescence images. Then, we build a null hypothesis model in which the distribution of the distance between two independently randomly drawn detections in the cell is estimated by a kernel method. The observed distances are tested against this null model. Our tests control the false discovery rate (FDR) of the co-localizations. Simulations show that this approach has a good specificity. Furthermore, our method has been successfully applied in a real problem of protein colocalization analysis during the endocytic process.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bo Zhang"", ids = ""152139711""); list(name = ""Nicolas Chenouard"", ids = ""1716972""); list(name = ""Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin"", ids = ""115054733""); list(name = ""Vannary Meas-Yedid"", ids = ""1397617984"")",40dc004124a4b5ca5c007ee51fb237d982149d93; e937e27601cdb062f5fe79f5ec53a9a837ad15ba; b3065ac293bd46b4d7ae051aad5b5cad9519efe7; 2bc910cdeca72157178dfedff3c95fcb3a3d171d; 52525e891dfe3d930c4fa54a6bfa48bdc2af0ffb; f45f20b70887786ff3c14f064209d5e913f111f4; bed1ba8eb96e4696b03c88090a3e409b3422c665; 23391acbb265f0a438add92f45f151ded3a547c8; 58d3d60a3338238757ff758783cb7d9d64b7fb3b; 88f6f53742c352228bcee38bfe149caef719a203; ac2925e2d0bf683d7750dd2c6b156c43515f5162; 4b3f79fa1f2e5d12740a1007c33bc45f4e3c6655; 288b0bff5105bd87bb64c1e5d4814d395bc5b3dd; 39ae2a31e9b7f638236cfb6e0ba20dbdb5dd70b7,156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 889f4590a0feacfb532ccd84c22ac4f04a0a60f8; 92038c1a08fabe2e0c7211787a890215726f0f0f; 10c9fbb435d973e137210af90b22b549faf2d590; e606aaada0621493a6fecbf0b94f16470b6a1117; 201bee51b0387fece1ebc2fded07fec48fa49740; a3b8146c7950597628689d14551e74d46cc3543d; 94fceeff6235b741fc1c535b93b0b5a937208eaa; 3e0e337b477e0c226da00eae03fd29882275a469; 4f6e4e6afa9b21fd8067f0d182e6b8162b8a4d2a; 7cd189a149476ad390fe67133678370d1f646836; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d57f78a662fb634dc36496b39d4a5026caad9c6a; 594fd2cdafd5b1554c0c458d039d5ab0113daa7d,2008 5th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro,,1327-1330
f028411e28cd4a42b7ca17587156d0a08f7df7fb,Functional neuroanatomy underlying the clinical subcategorization of minimally conscious state patients,"Patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) show restricted signs of awareness but are unable to communicate. We assessed cerebral glucose metabolism in MCS patients and tested the hypothesis that this entity can be subcategorized into MCSâˆ’ (i.e., patients only showing nonreflex behavior such as visual pursuit, localization of noxious stimulation and/or contingent behavior) and MCS+ (i.e., patients showing command following).Patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism were studied using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in 39 healthy volunteers (aged 46Â Â±Â 18Â years) and 27 MCS patients of whom 13 were MCSâˆ’ (aged 49Â Â±Â 19Â years; 4 traumatic; 21Â Â±Â 23Â months post injury) and 14 MCS+ (aged 43Â Â±Â 19Â years; 5 traumatic; 19Â Â±Â 26Â months post injury). Results were thresholded for significance at false discovery rate corrected pÂ <Â 0.05.We observed a metabolic impairment in a bilateral subcortical (thalamus and caudate) and cortical (fronto-temporo-parietal) network in nontraumatic and traumatic MCS patients. Compared to MCSâˆ’, patients in MCS+ showed higher cerebral metabolism in left-sided cortical areas encompassing the language network, premotor, presupplementary motor, and sensorimotor cortices. A functional connectivity study showed that Brocaâ€™s region was disconnected from the rest of the language network, mesiofrontal and cerebellar areas in MCSâˆ’ as compared to MCS+ patients.The proposed subcategorization of MCS based on the presence or absence of command following showed a different functional neuroanatomy. MCSâˆ’ is characterized by preserved right hemispheric cortical metabolism interpreted as evidence of residual sensory consciousness. MCS+ patients showed preserved metabolism and functional connectivity in language networks arguably reflecting some additional higher order or extended consciousness albeit devoid of clinical verbal or nonverbal expression.",2011,Psychology;

652e0fbc0b202ca8deecce939856548120fd3cca,Analysis of gene expression in pathophysiological states: balancing false discovery and false negative rates.,"Nucleotide-microarray technology, which allows the simultaneous measurement of the expression of tens of thousands of genes, has become an important tool in the study of disease. In disorders such as malignancy, gene expression often undergoes broad changes of sizable magnitude, whereas in many common multifactorial diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis, the changes in gene expression are modest. In the latter circumstance, it is therefore challenging to distinguish the truly changing from non-changing genes, especially because statistical significance must be considered in the context of multiple hypothesis testing. Here, we present a balanced probability analysis (BPA), which provides the biologist with an approach to interpret results in the context of the total number of genes truly differentially expressed and false discovery and false negative rates for the list of genes reaching any significance threshold. In situations where the changes are of modest magnitude, sole consideration of the false discovery rate can result in poor power to detect genes truly differentially expressed. Concomitant analysis of the rate of truly differentially expressed genes not identified, i.e., the false negative rate, allows balancing of the two error rates and a more thorough insight into the data. To this end, we have developed a unique, model-based procedure for the estimation of false negative rates, which allows application of BPA to real data in which changes are modest.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrew W.

4704bbe1c16f0517da12d43dd680b27d96bf0e9c,Computational Biology of Transcription Factor Binding,"Here we provide a pragmatic, high-level overview of the computational approaches and tools for the discovery of transcription factor binding sites. Unraveling transcription regulatory networks and their malfunctions such as cancer became feasible due to recent stellar progress in experimental techniques and computational analyses. While predictions of isolated sites still pose notorious challenges, cisregulatory modules (clusters) of binding sites can now be identified with high accuracy. Further support comes from conserved DNA segments, co-regulation, transposable elements, nucleosomes, and three-dimensional chromosomal structures. We introduce computational tools for the analysis and interpretation of chromatin immunoprecipitation, next-generation sequencing, SELEX, and protein-binding microarray results. Because immunoprecipitation produces overly large DNA segments and well over half of the sequencing reads from constitute background noise, methods are presented for background correction, sequence read mapping, peak calling, false discovery rate estimation, and co-localization analyses. To discover short binding site motifs from extensive immunoprecipitation segments, we recommend algorithms and software based on expectation maximization and Gibbs sampling. Data integration using several databases further improves performance. Binding sites can be visualized in genomic and chromatin context using genome browsers.

4b441b8c814f674741396d1b0c011993f176ab25,Feature selection in finite mixture of sparse normal linear models in high-dimensional feature space.,"Rapid advancement in modern technology has allowed scientists to collect data of unprecedented size and complexity. This is particularly the case in genomics applications. One type of statistical problem in such applications is concerned with modeling an output variable as a function of a small subset of a large number of features based on relatively small sample sizes, which may even be coming from multiple subpopulations. As such, selecting the correct predictive features (variables) for each subpopulation is the key. To address this issue, we consider the problem of feature selection in finite mixture of sparse normal linear (FMSL) models in large feature spaces. We propose a 2-stage procedure to overcome computational difficulties and large false discovery rates caused by the large model space. First, to deal with the curse of dimensionality, a likelihood-based boosting is designed to effectively reduce the number of candidate features. This is the key thrust of our new method. The greatly reduced set of features is then subjected to a sparsity inducing procedure via a penalized likelihood method. A novel scheme is also proposed for the difficult problem of finding good starting points for the expectation-maximization estimation of mixture parameters. We use an extended Bayesian information criterion to determine the final FMSL model. Simulation results indicate that the procedure is successful in selecting the significant features without including a large number of insignificant ones. A real data example on gene transcription regulation is also presented.",2011,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Abbas Khalili"", ids = ""38324559""); list(name = ""Jiahua Chen"", ids = ""50763339""); list(name = ""Shili Lin"", ids = ""1787001"")",cdf4fa4c9fcca9abfc95f338e81c05f94366ca8d; 7df3b0c7cc025e97ff83aef9ee2b526e32770a20; 5f9d46c7edb4158fe954555c0d5b7bf2e01e7165; 36fdf4204d5a78748384e5e10647085477a87d59; e8046eb51450fbc1b360d6d8a29f2d056ebdf455; 86ced36172d2ba3d17ed85212cfcf96fa96eae2c; e2d3b24512d9492a10ed0afc0f250c6d49af3872; e034e4532983203bb4b951a4aaedc106ee09527b; e1d890be3e704bf30ecb693a7ca6d3d29c41c648; 8d1d41ad8f4e0c9450076b3ca812e9f7511075a9; 410244d776840e5d6631190b54a49b007c397ffa; 86d00bac96857067aa60ad37e00aa172f9312659; 0afb55f38a3005cff71a8fe785cf74cbc725226c,fe4b07489942fc80654e9a87663aee3aa5119429; b9edea795d66a977c708b9403f41f298cbb69f2e; ab187a757d536371f0ca909aad8e5d995f04fac9; 389f60074da32aa4d9f36eb8c4ff7ae2d19c27ad; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 88a2f5129a01f5a7b1a2bb4e802d046822f65a39; 25a2342cd517b6c7a3f38d98e782137ad0172cf6; baf2d3bfd1bf3ae76c8912131182782a7fd3b6b2; ceffcdae65f3ac3aa20df41d238551d54b1ea58a; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; ca6077253dd62c1d98994e02f8e406251b7dd16c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,Biostatistics,12 1,"

38080cb7c8849a4e615fca278916ad8d174b880f,Gene expression differences in healthy brachial and femoral arteries of Rapacz familial hypercholesterolemic swine.,"The mechanisms underlying the unequal distribution of atherosclerotic disease in the peripheral arteries are currently unclear. Gene expression differences in healthy arteries may influence the heterogeneous distribution of atherosclerosis. Therefore, this investigation compares gene expression in healthy atheroprotected brachial and atherosusceptible femoral arteries of young and disease free Rapacz familial hypercholesterolemic (FHC) swine. We hypothesized that transcripts related to atherosusceptibility would be differentially expressed between these arteries prior to the onset of disease. Femoral and brachial arteries were harvested from four 13-day-old Rapacz FHC swine. No atherosclerotic disease was detected using Sudan IV, Verhoeff-van Gieson, and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Gene expression was quantified using Affymetrix GeneChip Porcine Genome Arrays. An average of 15,552 probe sets had detectable transcripts, while 430 probe sets showed a significant differential expression between arteries (false discovery rate < 0.05). The human orthologs of 63 probe sets with differential expression and a 1.5-fold or greater transcript abundance between arteries are associated with Wnt/Î²-catenin, lysophospholipid, and Ca-signaling, as well as apoptosis. This is the first investigation reporting that differences in relative abundance of gene expression exist between brachial and femoral arteries in young Rapacz FHC swine prior to the development of atherosclerotic lesions.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Martin Bahls"", ids = ""49397345""); list(name = ""Christopher A.

6fa3a26c90d1d0481bd39c01b95d973daa25d75c,"Air pollution and childhood bronchitis: Interaction with xenobiotic, immune regulatory and DNA repair genes.","BACKGROUND
Gene-environment interactions have been investigated for diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer etc. but acute disease like bronchitis has rarely been studied. We investigated interactions between air pollution (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and particulate matter <2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5)) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in EPHX1, IL10, STAT4 and XPC genes in relation to bronchitis in children aged 0-2 years.


METHODS
A stratified random sample of 1133 Czech children, born between 1994 and 1998 in two districts, were followed since birth, of which 626 were genotyped. Pediatrician-diagnosed bronchitis episodes were obtained from the medical records. Central-site monitors measured air pollution exposure. We used multivariable logistic regression and estimated coefficients using generalized estimating equations. Interaction was assessed between pollutants and genes and associations in genotype-specific strata were presented. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
There were 803 episodes of bronchitis with an incidence rate of 56 per 1000 child-months. We found significant gene-environment interaction between PAH and four SNPs (EPHX1, (rs2854461), STAT4 (rs16833215), XPC (rs2228001 and rs2733532)), which became non-significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

0002ad663a75c8b69f7a4d5872578fd35473ca9d,Two types of human malignant melanoma cell lines revealed by expression patterns of mitochondrial and survival-apoptosis genes: implications for malignant melanoma therapy.,"Human malignant melanoma has poor prognosis because of resistance to apoptosis and therapy. We describe identification of the expression profile of 1,037 mitochondria-focused genes and 84 survival-apoptosis genes in 21 malignant melanoma cell lines and 3 normal melanocyte controls using recently developed hMitChip3 cDNA microarrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of 1,037 informative genes, and 84 survival-apoptosis genes, classified these malignant melanoma cell lines into type A (n = 12) and type B (n = 9). Three hundred fifty-five of 1,037 (34.2%) genes displayed significant (P â‰¤ 0.030; false discovery rate â‰¤ 3.68%) differences (Â± â‰¥ 2.0-fold) in average expression, with 197 genes higher and 158 genes lower in type A than in type B. Of 84 genes with known survival-apoptosis functions, 38 (45.2%) displayed the significant (P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.15%) difference. Antiapoptotic (BCL2, BCL2A1, PPARD, and RAF1), antioxidant (MT3, PRDX5, PRDX3, GPX4, GLRX2, and GSR), and proapoptotic (BAD, BNIP1, APAF1, BNIP3L, CASP7, CYCS, CASP1, and VDAC1) genes expressed at higher levels in type A than in type B, whereas the different set of antiapoptotic (PSEN1, PPP2CA, API5, PPP2R1B, PPP2R1A, and FIS1), antioxidant (HSPD1, GSS, SOD1, ATOX1, and CAT), and proapoptotic (ENDOG, BAK1, CASP2, CASP4, PDCD5, HTRA2, SEPT4, TNFSF10, and PRODH) genes expressed at lower levels in type A than in type B. Microarray data were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. These results showed the presence of two types of malignant melanoma, each with a specific set of dysregulated survival-apoptosis genes, which may prove useful for development of new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention and novel diagnostic biomarkers for treatment and prognosis of malignant melanoma.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""David M.

bd5d29df94266493e325027c3f277260d45b82ad,Gene Expression Changes Between Patent and Fused Cranial Sutures in a Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis Population,"OBJECTIVE
Craniosynostosis is a premature fusion of 1 or more cranial sutures. It may occur with additional morphological abnormalities (syndromic) or in isolation. Studies suggest that dysregulation of normal cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration has a role in isolated or nonsyndromic craniosynostosis but the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of this research is to identify genes differentially expressed in prematurely fused human suture compared to patent suture in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis.


METHODS
Bone fragments from synostosed and patent sutures of 7 infants with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis were collected during surgical release of fused sutures. RNA was isolated from the fragments (7 patent and 7 fused) and global gene expression profiled using the Illumina WGE-DASL assay and HumanRef 8.0 Beadchip.


RESULTS
Comparison of mRNA expression in fused and patent suture identified 68 genes significantly differentially expressed and having fold changes â‰¤ -2.0 and â‰¥ 2.0 with a false discovery rate adjusted P value at .10 and 136 with adjusted P value of 0.15. SFRP2 (secreted frizzled-related protein 2) demonstrated the largest decrease in fused sutures. Analysis including only sagittal fused sutures revealed a set of 35 overlapping genes that may be involved in suture patency over all suture types. SPHKAP (sphingosine kinase type 1-interacting protein), a modulator of TGFÎ² signaling, was significant in the sagittal subset.


CONCLUSION
Differentially expressed genes were identified in fused suture relative to patent in a nonsyndromic craniosynostosis population. SFRP2 is likely important in suture patency. Genes having significant roles in osteoblastogenesis as negative regulators of canonical Wnt pathway were significantly downregulated.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Amiee B.

877a089037758be21c941f6bab741d811a4585b0,"Evolution of humeral microanatomy and lifestyle in amniotes, and some comments on palaeobiological inferences","A study on the most exhaustive taxonomic sample of amniotes (75 extant and nine extinct taxa) of any quantitative work on this topic published so far demonstrates a strong relationship between lifestyle (aquatic, amphibious or terrestrial) and humeral microanatomy. We suggest that corrections for multiple testing be used to check for statistical artefacts in the context of a phylogenetic independent contrast analysis, and we use the false discovery rate procedure for this. Linear discriminant models segregate the various lifestyles with excellent success rate of up to 98.5%. Lifestyle was thus inferred for six extinct taxa of uncertain habitat. The results obtained suggest that Captorhinus, Claudiosaurus, and Placodus were amphibious, whereas Neusticosaurus and Mesosaurus were aquatic. Lystrosaurus may have been more aquatic than previously suggested, although the results of our inference models have to be integrated with other sources of data, which suggest that it may have been amphibious, rather than aquatic (as a literal interpretation of the models would suggest). Finally, we propose an alternative method of palaeobiological inference for hypothetical ancestors.Â Â© 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 100, 384â€“406.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Aurore Canoville"", ids = ""6477251"");

Human genetic studies can offer leads toward such improved strategies, both by providing better ways of identifying individuals at increased risk for CAD (risk stratification) and by informing the scientific community about novel biology, pathways, and potential targets for development of the next generation of pharmaceutical drugs.

In this issue of Circulation Research , LeBlanc et al4 have applied an innovative statistical approach to existing large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CAD and risk factors for CAD to enable discovery of novel disease loci.4 By combining results on association of CAD loci from the Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication and Meta-Analysis (CARDIoGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery Disease (C4D) Consortium (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D)5 with results on CAD risk factors from other consortia, they report 67 novel CAD loci, of which 42 were not previously reported using a traditional, unconditional false discovery rate. In addition, they provide eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) evidence for 32 of these 67 loci, and ingenuity pathway analysis of these associations shows enrichment of pathways involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism. By using this novel approach of combining publically available meta-analyses of GWAS, they show a large extent of shared genetic determinants between these cardiovascular risk factors and CAD. This underlines the shared polygeneticity of these â€¦",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Quertermous"", ids = ""5970014""); list(name = ""Erik Ingelsson"", ids = ""2105755"")",1d2fa2afa5daf268c53724b34b0056ec9361cea4; 8f3cdd02423b66214556023396aa684bf62522c2; 2676cf64e557cbe2b958c032a1e6d1028e8e63bf; a774b411609f8c3866a0dfcb63d3dbbd370e8094,37c6f33236e4869e80421be389a56eaac8c0ba69; 2da4775c6cdbf4a6bcd8a63410cddd43e8ff098d; 80fe5d7452bb2dd8f613e7cbeedb753d086b9f83; b406783a55ccd5f2acff93dc206b37df3d86eb0e; ebf39935ff9d715759e26e1b7b132c37a2c6837e; 40696993e14e05125f8dfa2577e94d9981d68cf2; a08425b9eb5241904ac17edc533989c98a07b966; e10cc6621c1b7e04eab18441d581ccb21767ba67; 819c6ba76809432accdda0c060fae97cf291ac1e; c6d1baff006f163da82bc76a70c82a97c6c8095e; 6d30cc5da19fc0e958233e4d55a8867c1aa34f42; 383b1241ae7aae63da299a6b106d67dc9da3e144; 1398bf4e988c16f35e7adc8deb4f917043bd5998,Circulation research,118 1,"

A cross-over design (CD) is widely used to compare multiple groups in order to verify the statistical significance of mean difference among multiple groups, because it has an advantage of removing any factors caused by subject variability. When multi-omics data such as metabolomics data is analysed, we often adopt CD to identify biomarkers that have group effects. While some methods exist for determining the sample size when comparing two groups, no available method allows comparison of more than two treatment groups. In this research, we propose a novel method for determining the sample size of CD with multiple treatment groups. We first propose a method for testing single biomarkers and then a method for a large number of biomarkers while controlling the false discovery rate or the family wise error rate.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yongjun Jo"", ids = ""6196862""); list(name = ""Hyojin Lee"", ids = ""46900357""); list(name = ""Oran Kwon"", ids = ""145010833""); list(name = ""Taesung Park"", ids = ""144903092"")",,880de73242ff2c8023ac7b7f338d4685bca61064; 3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; a7c7c10a521cc9659578d13c005f07ca47e33656; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; b8920ba9a40fc07dbb41f1ca2acf4154cd00b7a7; 68f1683b30f3985f97043f5c22dd0c4cae6c3c0a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6afa524382ed875954f5a1d534da3878fb4dcaff; 2b4666bacc36c8b25d1c495cda94e2a3f5299e45,IJDMB,20,36-46
9c7179ceee6cea05636188588b9a4fd3e6f41a73,Rs495828 polymorphism of the ABO gene is a predictor of enalapril-induced cough in Chinese patients with essential hypertension.,"OBJECTIVE
ABO genetic polymorphisms have recently been associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and inflammation, which play a critical role in the pathogenic mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough. Therefore, the current study determined the association of ABO genetic polymorphisms with enalapril-induced cough in Chinese patients with essential hypertension.


METHODS
A total of 450 essential hypertensive patients treated with 10 mg of enalapril maleate were genotyped for ABO genetic polymorphisms using the PCR-direct sequencing method. Cough was recorded when patients were bothered by cough and respiratory symptoms during enalapril treatment without an identifiable cause.


RESULTS
The distribution of rs8176740 and rs495828 was different between the coughers and the controls [P=0.039; odds ratio (OR)=0.70, P=0.018; OR=1.41]. The risk of enalapril-induced cough in the rs495828 TT carriers was increased (P=0.008; OR=2.69), which remained significant after false discovery rate correction. The results for the rs8176740 polymorphism were significant in the female subgroup (P=0.027; OR=0.22). Haplotype analysis of the four ABO polymorphisms (rs8176746/rs8176740/rs495828/rs12683493) showed that the frequency of the GATC haplotype was higher in the coughers than those in the controls (26.6 vs. 18.8%, P=0.033; OR=1.43).


CONCLUSION
The rs495828 polymorphism was associated with enalapril-induced cough and may serve as a useful pharmacogenomics marker of the safety of enalapril in Chinese patients with essential hypertension. The mechanism for the associations may involve the effects of the ABO gene or ABO blood type on ACE activity and inflammation.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jian-Quan Luo"", ids = ""7029802""); list(name = ""Fa-zhong He"", ids = ""7250551""); list(name = ""Zhi-ying Luo"", ids = ""2574531""); list(name = ""Jiagen Wen"", ids = ""3703046""); list(name = ""Lu-yan Wang"", ids = ""1887440""); list(name = ""Ning-Ling Sun"", ids = ""153726323""); list(name = ""Gen-fu Tang"", ids = ""34222208""); list(name = ""Qing Li"", ids = ""1699383""); list(name = ""Dong Guo"", ids = ""144207397""); list(name = ""Zhao-Qian Liu"", ids = ""86906213""); list(name = ""Hong-hao Zhou"", ids = ""48054489""); list(name = ""Xiao-Ping Chen"", ids = ""48283475""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""49039152"")",558d9dad56bc0c9ad1f7102dc0f266d02fde8020; bb0320790f0272004eb4b804915bacade9c206d6; 42088609eb81a573df2ac1522162b5735f6f7b26; fcdf0485bdf0c8082c84b755cd6f46bb6eb2ecd1; 13e65b087ecebf77a5503304951bb6cefc4c6dfe; 09050e27adb5512a8e9e4dba1977aaf764c70533,babf56845b23c063c27ac81bf72dabc92f71afd6; de699ba2398fa88a2724fe64c7de5b72ce0def6e; 79842c3b836c103530a7253c63d302e4b74fa6ef; 45a573f3d0bc03910f773fdf402291482953385a; 5672c490e471ce92b0d9221bcfcb47e7af6430ec; 500247d90dab0d9214379d2a0750e8c3c859d690; 405d5860d1881a91f354b458a688dfe8d37f0d8f; 001dd393c35789dd82f0d67508b11f703b66b08b; cda9ee9a350ed0338c99455ab69dc2e66cadd0da; 1588ce88033a21302107d5e88d00326cde626f42; 3ca1b16ba5f73715ee873834a15b85fdd6a2e0b5; 701b84fa0960b4ba5ca10ec49c3eece464b26782; 907826f9cd3bc9983aa42e70b621d4d55faacf19; e3a5e069f611476be9131c8ef902a4eea5d4fa25; a4834d5d528c7aa9f85f3356395b5492231b9b72; 72d9cb87380b11097efaecc7364ff22621b8dbba; f114690d2e454a160a251f31401cd3a657555a66; 2227aa0f11ac96ffecee140e0290de689580d785; d004d5ab8c80f5c20a4f908553cd143e41e016f9; 320a0b681e2501be8dd6a72c3eb7ddb63f58109f; 76758eff9cfafad3d834abbdc2c79fa52269e47c; 0fabc0cc99623e847e062a78e9d237ce619fe2c9; 585f4150bd32b8a803904d4dc63be333d31b0e71; 90955330eb7a87fd48630f9c0e1511f5f3964c2e; 96b59180124af0aa0174fda17a1fb73a800640c9; 57c022340849d9aec22ae7d6eabd61f81a17c90c; af26ae370197adf053eb8a4a8b6fc2e06dcac1e3; 4ddd50eb560a216d5f3b3e7f063f8c26c6f4c190; c82394f1ec8aa0afb7e3a34514f31df91aa97498; daefc07cdfa81352c10ffc2e1a45ce9f81ebcf6c; e2d2cf380bf06014f9f04dfbd7b8de1caf09ac3e; 4bde913a9299115912d00aeb259104c16f76ebb9; 2ae25ee9f4845a4ca740e440c02ffa449e7a5f6b; d7e2043edcf540c27739458bb02c10915e761f57; 9f6f6c8fbaf5a3985a3dacd4c72cb0552941fe51; 768381208b7e9e5010f0bc3221c6c19361233b03; a4356388cae5e0c2d7bbe8d5ae8e2a5b7a1866d9; a8b905152ea6f2900f4a0658267f93f38fab3f24,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,24 6,"

600d99d9959578a81d611678964b7a4f8cb75730,Adjusted Bayesian inference for selected parameters,"Summary.â€‚ We address the problem of providing inference from a Bayesian perspective for parameters selected after viewing the data. We present a Bayesian framework for providing inference for selected parameters, based on the observation that providing Bayesian inference for selected parameters is a truncated data problem. We show that if the prior for the parameter is non-informative, or if the parameter is a â€˜fixedâ€™ unknown constant, then it is necessary to adjust the Bayesian inference for selection. Our second contribution is the introduction of Bayesian false discovery rate controlling methodology, which generalizes existing Bayesian false discovery rate methods that are only defined in the two-group mixture model. We illustrate our results by applying them to simulated data and data from a microarray experiment.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Daniel Yekutieli"", ids = ""2398627"")",ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; 3b6f86c18c2ac927332200acc56d0691ae2b5afe; 761a257095a4064d0a9ff6d85efcc6269f8b1820; 105a19431ddfcfd2e6195176059a49c3232ddda4; 1cde092ab27bf3359036add31f172bc3c31f7093; f19df596878aedeef53cc0bcccd2a49dfdf7bde9; 99ccb3cb38209dd60e06527f8c578446d7c70d88; 582f85f0248c1496ae067cdb6cf2b6f9f134d929; 9e3242422bb604de9930ff8e45c82b9421d70c08; 1e18ad1d5a5311cfc801755fbf5a2c302116ffa1; 4f66bf775803007d8795b4bdddcb2edc6c921880; e9863d9f3bb0954c9b12e101c554c4ffe15a09d6; bfc514cc0b64ef34a96d3c0248223c739b9930d1; 39a517a7418e60a1f3270b4cc0f019646b79cca9; 5c293019bdc9a8ba3bc9eee07e869e3b305a4d70; baa6897ce34a07fb17ae473f5cd4e9afe4bc668b; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; 18efdd97521a315d4916549901a27ab90a766417,a205103d4f25ae39f417bac7bd5142302d7f448c; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f45f963b7b967d526651937c0e5486c8448209cd; b5caca23e122b8780da1aa8addf1830b2204244f; bc91c41845a028bc6c19a40a96583d21d628083a; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c6546d345ac1aedbf3a54272a5c9f53d5fdbe290; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; f084ac47730dcb0ec24ee3b5093057b305b6c161; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 7b8471aaa7e055bf7235aad8eb173ed87dced7ac; 8b5904f09ea28a8956746763b5ab3952972216cd; a7e66d7436849cbd19e6991d2c4d06fb06580a79; b9dd05b69d6906fff6ea6c4ba3609a6d97c9b8a3; 14a9f1bae2e1db75bcfe1bcf9eea1106af0f901e; 47f4b51e66d19fdc8feef5421aeb89f72acf44a3,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology,74,515-541
7e95f15e37f096ce8b617d5bb3b2332b57f14166,PTPN22 Association in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with Respect to Individual Ancestry and Clinical Sub-Phenotypes,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is a negative regulator of T-cell activation associated with several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Missense rs2476601 is associated with SLE in individuals with European ancestry. Since the rs2476601 risk allele frequency differs dramatically across ethnicities, we assessed robustness of PTPN22 association with SLE and its clinical sub-phenotypes across four ethnically diverse populations. Ten SNPs were genotyped in 8220 SLE cases and 7369 controls from in European-Americans (EA), African-Americans (AA), Asians (AS), and Hispanics (HS). We performed imputation-based association followed by conditional analysis to identify independent associations. Significantly associated SNPs were tested for association with SLE clinical sub-phenotypes, including autoantibody profiles. Multiple testing was accounted for by using false discovery rate. We successfully imputed and tested allelic association for 107 SNPs within the PTPN22 region and detected evidence of ethnic-specific associations from EA and HS. In EA, the strongest association was at rs2476601 (P = 4.7 Ã— 10(-9), OR = 1.40 (95% CI = 1.25-1.56)). Independent association with rs1217414 was also observed in EA, and both SNPs are correlated with increased European ancestry. For HS imputed intronic SNP, rs3765598, predicted to be a cis-eQTL, was associated (P = 0.007, OR = 0.79 and 95% CI = 0.67-0.94). No significant associations were observed in AA or AS. Case-only analysis using lupus-related clinical criteria revealed differences between EA SLE patients positive for moderate to high titers of IgG anti-cardiolipin (aCL IgG >20) versus negative aCL IgG at rs2476601 (P = 0.012, OR = 1.65). Association was reinforced when these cases were compared to controls (P = 2.7 Ã— 10(-5), OR = 2.11). Our results validate that rs2476601 is the most significantly associated SNP in individuals with European ancestry. Additionally, rs1217414 and rs3765598 may be associated with SLE. Further studies are required to confirm the involvement of rs2476601 with aCL IgG.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bahram Namjou"", ids = ""152235987""); list(name = ""Xana R Kim-Howard"", ids = ""1400174256""); list(name = ""Celi Sun"", ids = ""3256264""); list(name = ""Adam Adler"", ids = ""152309349""); list(name = ""Sharon A.

bc13654fe6d731f20efb02b693a7386121ba67db,Unique Effects of p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ Leukemic Cells On Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Gene Expression Profile in Vitro,"Abstract 3468 Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) participate in the generation of the microenvironmental bone marrow niche which protects normal and leukemic stem cells from injuries, including chemotherapy. MSC produce numerous factors that aid in this function; however, little is known about how leukemic cells affect MSC. In this study, paired murine AML cells, MLL/ENL/FIT3-ITD/p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ and MLL/ENL/FIT3-ITD/p53 wt , originally derived from C57BL/6 mice (Zuber et al. Genes & Dev. 2009 ), were co-cultured with MSC from the same strain. After 48 hrs, MSC were isolated by FACS sorting using CD45 âˆ’ /PDGFr + as markers. Total RNA was profiled on Illumina WG6 mouse whole-genome bead arrays by standard procedures. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method identified 429 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) whose expression in MSC differed significantly (false discovery rate, 10%) in co-cultures with p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ (C78) vs. p53 wt (C147) leukemic cells. Differences in these DEG were highly consistent in replicates (Figure 1). The results demonstrate that: 1) p53 status (p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ vs. p53 wt ) of AML cells affects GEP patterns in co-cultured MSC. Comparison of the GEP in MSC co-cultured with p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ (78) or p53 wt (147) (Fig 1) identified the following 5 genes that showed the most significant differences (up- or down-regulated): up-regulated: WNT16, WNT5, IGFBp5, GCNT1, ATP1B1; down-regulated: NOS2, DCN, CCL7, CCL2, CAR9, CCL4. These were selected for qPCR validation, and the results confirmed the array data. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that WNT16 was up-regulated in MSC co-cultured with p53 wt leukemic cells. In addition, CXCL5 was found up-regulated in MSC co-cultured with p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ leukemic cells. These results were consistent with the GEP data. 2) Leukemic cells alter MSC Signaling proteins in vitro: Western blotting showed that Stat3, Akt, PTEN, CXCL5 and HIF-1Î± were up- regulated in MSC co-cultured with p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ leukemic cells as compared to p53 wt leukemic cells (48 hrs). Additional analyses showed that the downstream targets of HIF-1Î±, VEGFa and VEGFc, but not VEGFb, were up-regulated. Taken together, these results suggest that 1) leukemic cells with different p53 genetic background co-cultured with normal MSC have profoundly differential effects on GEP of normal MSC; 2) MSC co-cultured with p53 âˆ’/âˆ’ leukemic cells resulted in increased levels of onco-proteins such as Akt and HIF-1Î± when compared to MSC co-cultured with p53 wt leukemic cells. Results suggest, for the first time, that the genetics of leukemic cells determines gene expression in co-cultured MSC. In vivo experiments are in progress to provide in vivo evidence for the existence of a novel model of leukemia-stroma interactions where the genetics of the tumor cell impacts stromal cell biology.

Subjects with one or two T alleles at rs2074733 in SF3A1 had a lower risk of PC compared to those with two C alleles in combined two populations (OR: 0.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.73, False discovery rate (FDR)-P = 1.5E-05). Moreover, the presence of the higher-risk genotype at rs2074733 plus smoking or drinking had synergic effects on PC risk. These findings illustrate that RNA splicing-related genes appear to be associated with the occurrence of PC, and show synergic interactions with smoking and drinking in the additive model. In the future, our novel findings should be further confirmed by functional studies and independent large-scale population studies.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Tian"", ids = ""145928766""); list(name = ""Yaping Liu"", ids = ""2398582""); list(name = ""Beibei Zhu"", ids = ""145801438""); list(name = ""Yao Tian"", ids = ""15322072""); list(name = ""Rong Zhong"", ids = ""144390571""); list(name = ""Wei Chen"", ids = ""47482506""); list(name = ""Xinghua Lu"", ids = ""50084941""); list(name = ""Li Zou"", ids = ""144124140""); list(name = ""Na Shen"", ids = ""47062333""); list(name = ""Jiaming Qian"", ids = ""9321349""); list(name = ""Hui Li"", ids = ""36527234""); list(name = ""Xiaoping Miao"", ids = ""144683186""); list(name = ""Li Wang"", ids = ""46659472"")",591014e7197e66761bace8557fc0ab9cd0841dec; b4d5970e52a9485ebad5e1a2cc4ca8ceff74ac93; 830da62a39bf3a749658d09d7acf398857dd03c0; 9b958eb6b06d9b386f770fb158f3c5c97c0e8241; a925028ba62d1ce9c67661d080bdde6a759f5652,845ac61443b4da894258e9572989ec724adf782e; 94405819edce290df7f6a5a836b0e254abb2ecf8; cf0cec7828b041efb5aa132636035ae7d64757bd; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; c5a1d626682ab20bd0fcab6c6f18805dde1239ec; 7c562279879e7a7888d4672aaf6d69f1ad36a48b; fcc794d59b6567b127253557b5b02bda2e201484; 9d64c685bf561d758a9a931cd7d673c8e2565a23; 6301c5f25d37aa2ba956cf71170ec123c6005570; 279b3346d3f7734221022882d469324152f687f8; 66f6a5b8da9cb79d8502cf899de6cee3612ad780; 7f27824c0c9d4a0f799a01223d8034cf74238182; 71c13f5f6006610daf0d0c41cf9bab755f958182; ef54bd8629f34b33996457bb29678a42aa9f2514; 7b2219a3355a45da95220215a00f789cb7bcb079; 6032ede125f770d2af6f9fde715583d94947d767; c520dcd646e110218107a6276be0a153ae81b8be; 947951c700b0a018e82be35c62520e274c7f618a; 74b2b0f6cd14263baca7f04c05d460a633265a1d; e6b7a352cb1e365f96bcacd686b09c5552adfac8; 944c96bbcba307110f83e5c9424d3bdce15b3ddd; b51e7456f9ce7e6b9292c783730339f0ebf4fb49; 6e487ab063fc9b945cd2f0c3dfff6655290e3145; e50ec5eb441e6711ad18b9436bdd0eee315269ba; 5f85c528919be955f619a572fdfd008429c8a8ce; 00346df0b59a97b54f31c84e3dbb715f6df6d7ae; 71310ffd27c9b16fa0210038c2cb2e2d05b945ad; 80921b558d37aec19c0d26e5a87f2f9b36157734; 5fbe61b94e014668eff875290c9339d154c205aa; 0bd35a6821fcb58405180b27eec2bc262e728e0f; 4b0281bf40ef8bd62c324fea9895be91921000dc; dff068e33f57c2ceb1067a87497430fd7ab9b95c; caa399c316ffa825f19579116503857a488b5b05; 1a9e79e605572ec6b7a75d277b772f12215f966f; 3f27c8a25cf485f70e49c0e3955ab4060c1a198b; dc7417a11d469877ada943d35abd30400de369b3; 4adc355cf67c5e8b673ec645d2ebea9ebb092bf3; 0526b32e8ae5ef4285dd2b1ea2f3045abe4ebe24; 252af3147d1a72b8a4752f7fa62d48aa7217b6c7; 92f0ce332a64ff95b8ba09c7948c63ad6b6992e4; 456de10f8693fa99f44514181eb8db7455ee66e1; ba530753696b61963b2c79607843368bc0dac740,Oncotarget,6,37750 - 37757

In this talk, we propose a new method named SLOPE to control the FDR in sparse high-dimensional linear regression. This computationally efficient procedure works by regularizing the fitted coefficients according to their ranks: the higher the rank, the larger the penalty. This is analogous to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which compares more significant p-values with more stringent thresholds. Whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated, we show empirically that SLOPE obtains FDR control at a reasonable level while offering substantial power. Although SLOPE is developed from a multiple testing viewpoint, we show the surprising result that it achieves optimal squared errors under Gaussian random designs over a wide range of sparsity classes. An appealing feature is that SLOPE does not require any knowledge of the degree of sparsity. This adaptivity to unknown sparsity has to do with the FDR control, which strikes the right balance between bias and variance. The proof of this result presents several elements not found in the high-dimensional statistics literature.",2016,,"list(name = ""Weijie J. Su"", ids = ""33747720"")",,,,,
377a6d6f3246bb6596b6d3872c11785a72116eb6,Genomewide analysis of bull sperm quality and fertility traits.,"Because the priority of AI industry is to identify subfertile bulls, a predictive model that allowed for the prediction of 91% bulls of low fertility was implemented based on seminological (motility) parameters and DNA status assessed both as DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and by TUNEL assay using sperm of 105 Holstein-Friesian bulls (four batches per bull) selected based on in vivo estimated relative conception rates (ERCR). Thereafter, sperm quality and male fertility traits of bulls were explored by GWAS using a high-density (777K) Illumina chip. After data editing, 85 bulls and 591,988 SNPs were retained for GWAS. Of 12 SNPs with false discovery rate <0.2, four SNPs located on BTA28 and BTA18 were significantly associated (LD-adjusted Bonferroni <0.05) with the non-compensatory sperm parameters DFI and TUNEL. Other SNPs of interest for potential association with TUNEL were found on BTA3, in the same chromosome where associations with non-compensatory in vivo bull fertility were already reported. Further suggestive SNPs for sperm membrane integrity were located on BTA28, the chromosome where QTL studies previously reported associations with sperm quality traits. Suggestive SNPs for ERCR were found on BTA18 in the vicinity of a site already associated with in vivo bull fertility. Additional SNPs associated with ERCR and sperm kinetic parameters were also identified. In contrast to other, but very few GWAS on fertility traits in bovine spermatozoa, which reported significant SNPs located on BTX, we have not identified SNPs of interest in this sexual chromosome.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roberto Puglisi"", ids = ""4471344""); list(name = ""G Gaspa"", ids = ""144599718""); list(name = ""Donatella Balduzzi"", ids = ""34622467""); list(name = ""Alex Severgnini"", ids = ""47977598""); list(name = ""Roberta Vanni"", ids = ""49232052""); list(name = ""N.P.P.

0643cec1b0055f0453a8448c54f52fcf90b6a6e2,Abstract C117: An integrated proteomic analysis of lung adenocarcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals potential targets for oncogene-negative tumors.,"Background: The discovery of driver genes such as EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 in non-small cell lung cancer has led to novel, highly active therapies for a subset of patients. However, the majority of lung adenocarcinomas do not have alterations in established driver oncogenes. Here we used an integrated proteomic and genomic analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify potential therapeutic targets in oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas.

Methods: Protein expression was measured by reverse phase protein array in 181 TCGA lung adenocarcinoma tumors. Protein levels were correlated with mutational status by t-test for individual mutations and for oncogene-positive versus negative tumors. A false discovery rate of 0.10 (corresponding p-value â‰¤0.047) was used for these analyses.

Results: Expression of 160 total and phospho-proteins were compared between oncogene-positive and negative tumors using reverse phase protein array (RPPA). Oncogene-positive tumors included those with canonical mutations in KRAS, EGFR, BRAF, ROS1, ALK, RET, MAPK1, HRAS, NRAS, AKT1, MET, or ERBB2. For the two most frequent driver oncogenes, KRAS (n=47) and EGFR (n=27), the top markers expressed in mutated tumors were pRaf/pMAPK/pERK (KRAS mutated) and pEGFR (EGFR mutated) (p<0.0001 for all). In contrast, oncogene-negative tumors had higher levels of protein markers associated with apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle. Among those overexpressed in oncogene-negative tumors, potentially targetable proteins included total and phosphorylated Chk1 (p=0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively), total and pChk2 (p=0.017 and 0.002), and Bim (p<0.0001). Thymidylate synthase, a marker previously associated with pemetrexed resistance, was also more highly expressed in oncogene-negative tumors (p<0.0001). KEAP1, a regulator of oxidative stress response, was the second most commonly mutated gene in oncogene-negative tumors (after TP53). KEAP1 mutated tumors expressed lower protein levels of KEAP1 (p<0.0001) and higher NRF2 (p<0.001) (normally targeted by KEAP1 for degradation), as well as lower levels of pAMPK and pNFKB (P<0.0001 and 0.006, respectively). Finally, KEAP1 mutated tumors were also frequently negative for expression of TTF1 (p=0.001, fisher test), a transcription factor commonly used as a histological marker in the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. In comparison, oncogene-positive tumors (especially EGFR and BRAF mutated adenocarcinomas) expressed high levels of TTF1.

Conclusion: Potentially targetable or predictive markers, including Chk1/2, Bim, and thymidylate synthase, were expressed at higher levels in oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas. These findings support further investigation of these targets and associated biomarkers and could provide a treatment strategy for patients without established driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK, and ROS1.

Top differentially expressed genes.,"Global RNA expression in breast muscle obtained from a male broiler line phenotyped for high or low feed efficiency (FE) was investigated. Pooled RNA samples (n = 6/phenotype) labeled with cyanine 3 or cyanine 5 fluorescent dyes to generate cRNA probes were hybridized on a 4 Ã— 44K chicken oligo microarray. Local polynomial regression normalization was applied to background-corrected red and green intensities with a moderated t-statistic. Corresponding P-values were computed and adjusted for multiple testing by false discovery rate to identify differentially expressed genes. Microarray validation was carried out by comparing findings with quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. A 1.3-fold difference in gene expression was set as a cutoff value, which encompassed 20% (782 of 4,011) of the total number of genes that were differentially expressed between FE phenotypes. Using an online software program (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis), the top 10 upregulated genes identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in the high-FE group were generally associated with anabolic processes. In contrast, 7 of the top 10 downregulated genes in the high-FE phenotype (upregulated in the low-FE phenotype) were associated with muscle fiber development, muscle function, and cytoskeletal organization, with the remaining 3 genes associated with self-recognition or stress-responding genes. The results from this study focusing on only the top differentially expressed genes suggest that the high-FE broiler phenotype is derived from the upregulation of genes associated with anabolic processes as well as a downregulation of genes associated with muscle fiber development, muscle function, cytoskeletal organization, and stress response.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""B C Kong"", ids = ""14048028""); list(name = ""Jeffrey Song"", ids = ""3131982""); list(name = ""Jeong Yoon Lee"", ids = ""4819103""); list(name = ""Billy Hargis"", ids = ""47149670""); list(name = ""Terry Wing"", ids = ""3649623""); list(name = ""Kentu Lassiter"", ids = ""37210337""); list(name = ""Walter Bottje"", ids = ""144822749"")",09c8bd3cceb640bc56ac4bb795082e6cbf69547b; b97d6d1dfcb1e89eb4e0ce13a595c4c053e76dab; bb66bc06a8c71e7b9c400f8d4afe7f07c9c85339; b8a8b72619a0bfe5b6cf02847b6161c208f29bfb; 7f4133cbfb7d35c840bc3f99fe1f83894eb9455a; 25c9e5d27809bc46de179f3c37d587aec885c8a3; df3502f2a9dedcd7110ef20e70d8f039e0777000; 7563f1c8498192a96fb5a1cc50829a1bfcfa19d0; 23ef80ed664fbbd289317c83e1157ca069e30724; ada01915d59ce5cb6c4b531ebc4c78fda2ba67d4; 0d7406db513e20b82c4e0d23e5ad8d9364281044; d07455baf399a6c53e19f768f26c61959fd69e37; dc114fdb41194b81fda3d31645d6075928aeffee; 4e5b8d93fb79295468452b3587b70db04b3f2343; 581a81b55933653d156dd396e7cf8d95b1effa8d; d7dc5251de7e00330b7ed784f08879d7d2ebe1ca; 088bf2dd91b269e598cff140ee97416b4be2b5d3; 4971fa031d6c475ffb949146d33c1d049e8bb901; 4bf6055e74048aaf66e1feaaa7f51627f831d5da; 61cf87a21c1d51af3e2387b9ef3fd2fef07072ca; d534630fc94cba3d06c0dd04233533d2288ed14a; 6c3894cbbf80199190f9057b6515c72e1e49668d; 2d84b6fba18f621333e34a7807572ce7ada302b2; b1e89b9f54c3e2cb61788dfd46ad382eddb3b37f; 472cd67cc3a6af030b1ee5b65bc7e2500e97d332; 23142971b401cf5fb0e7e622b0eba7ac3b7516e6; 8517aa7412ec7a93bd9c4a20867b3352a55c3d8a; 3da3c758543857fff336bea8a81773dd5d69d7c7; 52f56c03f19858af66c0d8ba4713aed697e16c3d; 34992b2dc1869b3f4235d55c41ed4746dd22b8de; 538b68ad99ebd427b812a25c4549090be6f95da6; 253fbf60a30c67568cb4c577f7c3c1177ca364b0; fbcf674cc2bc930ce822d4e1350bb0904e000da8,,Poultry science,90 11,"

2ef0faeef0edec770c5130571402e225debce72c,Transcriptome Analysis Describing New Immunity and Defense Genes in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients,"BACKGROUND
Large-scale gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients could provide a molecular description that reflects the contribution of diverse cellular responses associated with this disease. The aim of our study was to identify peripheral blood gene expression profiles for RA patients, using Illumina technology, to gain insights into RA molecular mechanisms.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
The Illumina Human-6v2 Expression BeadChips were used for a complete genome-wide transcript profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 RA patients and 15 controls. Differential analysis per gene was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR<5%). Genes differentially expressed at significant level between patients and controls were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) in the PANTHER database to identify biological processes. A differentially expression of 339 Reference Sequence genes (238 down-regulated and 101 up-regulated) between the two groups was observed. We identified a remarkably elevated expression of a spectrum of genes involved in Immunity and Defense in PBMCs of RA patients compared to controls. This result is confirmed by GO analysis, suggesting that these genes could be activated systemically in RA. No significant down-regulated ontology groups were found. Microarray data were validated by real time PCR in a set of nine genes showing a high degree of correlation.

774e7ed4152358d8935cf153dd7d93794bd84cea,KCNJ6 is Associated with Adult Alcohol Dependence and Involved in Gene Ã— Early Life Stress Interactions in Adolescent Alcohol Drinking,"Alcohol abuse and dependence have proven to be complex genetic traits that are influenced by environmental factors. Primate and human studies have shown that early life stress increases the propensity for alcohol abuse in later life. The reinforcing properties of alcohol are mediated by dopaminergic signaling; however, there is little evidence to indicate how stress alters alcohol reinforcement. KCNJ6 (the gene encoding G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel 2 (GIRK2)) is a brain expressed potassium channel with inhibitory effects on dopaminergic tone. The properties of GIRK2 have been shown to be enhanced by the stress peptide corticotrophin-releasing hormone. Therefore, we sought to examine the role of KCNJ6 polymorphisms in adult alcohol dependence and stress-related alcohol abuse in adolescents. We selected 11 SNPs in the promoter region of KCNJ6, which were genotyped in 1152 adult alcohol dependents and 1203 controls. One SNP, rs2836016, was found to be associated with alcohol dependence (p=0.01, false discovery rate). We then assessed rs2836016 in an adolescent sample of 261 subjects, which were characterized for early life stress and adolescent hazardous drinking, defined using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), to examine geneâ€“environment interactions. In the adolescent sample, the risk genotype of rs2836016 was significantly associated with increased AUDIT scores, but only in those individuals exposed to high levels of psychosocial stress in early life (p=0.01). Our findings show that KCNJ6 is associated with alcohol dependence and may moderate the effect of early psychosocial stress on risky alcohol drinking in adolescents. We have identified a candidate gene for future studies investigating a possible functional link between the response to stress and alcohol reinforcement.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Toni-Kim Clarke"", ids = ""145792125""); list(name = ""Manfred Laucht"", ids = ""3254418""); list(name = ""Monika Ridinger"", ids = ""2893733""); list(name = ""Norbert Wodarz"", ids = ""6984865""); list(name = ""Marcella Rietschel"", ids = ""3100404""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Maier"", ids = ""144795478""); list(name = ""Mark Lathrop"", ids = ""145123879""); list(name = ""Anbarasu Lourdusamy"", ids = ""2423196""); list(name = ""Ulrich S.

Different molecules and cell types have been reported to enhance the proliferation and survival of CLL cells. The presence of CLL cells in three distinct compartments: peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and lymph node (LN), provides a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of the microenvironment on tumor cell biology in-vivo. To this effect, we used gene expression profiling (Affymetrix HU133 plus arrays) to compare purified CLL cells sampled from PB, BM, and/or LN from 24 previously untreated patients. Initially, an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all samples appeared to be dominated by the effect of the individual patient. However, in 12 patients where all three sites had been sampled, we used a 3-level one-way ANOVA blocked by patients to estimate patient effect and tissue effect. Three principal components of the 36 samples revealed a clear separation of the tumor cells according to their compartment of origin. Furthermore, supervised analysis with a cutoff of >2-fold change and false discovery rate P =0.04). The E2F score was also an excellent predictor of tumor progression measured as progression free survival (PFS) from diagnosis to treatment: patients with a high E2F score had a median PFS of 16.6 months compared to a PFS in excess of 10 years for patients with a low score ( P =0.015). The acquired proliferation and activation signatures in CLL cells which are more prominent in LN resident CLL cells than in cells residing in the BM, suggests that the two microenvironment niches are not identical. Possible upstream cascades driving the signature of CLL cells in the tissue appear to be related to NF-kB and B-cell receptor activation. In conclusion: proliferation and cell activation signatures are acquired in the tissue and are more prominent in LN resident CLL cells than in the BM, suggesting that these two microenvironmental niches have different effects on tumor biology. The LN E2F proliferation signature was more prominent in IgVH unmutated CLL cells and correlated with clinical disease progression.

328f5baa6c03af7d5bdab8df87385aa181db623f,"A Comprehensive, Open-source Platform for Mass Spectrometry-based Glycoproteomics Data Analysis.","Glycosylation is among the most abundant and diverse protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) identified to date. The structural analysis of this PTM is challenging because of the diverse monosaccharides which are not conserved among organisms, the branched nature of glycans, their isomeric structures, and heterogeneity in the glycan distribution at a given site. Glycoproteomics experiments have adopted the traditional high-throughput LC-MSn proteomics workflow to analyze site-specific glycosylation. However, comprehensive computational platforms for data analyses are scarce. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive, open-source, modular software for glycoproteomics data analysis called GlycoPAT (GlycoProteomics Analysis Toolbox; freely available from www.VirtualGlycome.org/glycopat). The program includes three major advances: (1) ""SmallGlyPep,"" a minimal linear representation of glycopeptides for MSn data analysis. This format allows facile serial fragmentation of both the peptide backbone and PTM at one or more locations. (2) A novel scoring scheme based on calculation of the ""Ensemble Score (ES),"" a measure that scores and rank-orders MS/MS spectrum for N- and O-linked glycopeptides using cross-correlation and probability based analyses. (3) A false discovery rate (FDR) calculation scheme where decoy glycopeptides are created by simultaneously scrambling the amino acid sequence and by introducing artificial monosaccharides by perturbing the original sugar mass. Parallel computing facilities and user-friendly GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) are also provided. GlycoPAT is used to catalogue site-specific glycosylation on simple glycoproteins, standard protein mixtures and human plasma cryoprecipitate samples in three common MS/MS fragmentation modes: CID, HCD and ETD. It is also used to identify 960 unique glycopeptides in cell lysates from prostate cancer cells. The results show that the simultaneous consideration of peptide and glycan fragmentation is necessary for high quality MSn spectrum annotation in CID and HCD fragmentation modes. Additionally, they confirm the suitability of GlycoPAT to analyze shotgun glycoproteomics data.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gang Liu"", ids = ""145634943""); list(name = ""Kai Cheng"", ids = ""143603109""); list(name = ""Chi Y.

The causal pathogens are Didymella pinodes, Phoma medicaginis var pinodella and, in South Australia, P. koolunga. This study aimed to identify candidate genes that map to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Ascochyta blight field disease resistance and to explore the role of epistatic interactions. Candidate genes associated with QTL were identified beginning with 101 defence-related genes from the published literature. Synteny between pea and Medicago truncatula was used to narrow down the candidates for mapping. Fourteen pea candidate sequences were mapped in two QTL mapping populations, A26Â Ã—Â Rovar and A88Â Ã—Â Rovar. QTL peaks, or the intervals containing QTL peaks, for the Asc2.1, Asc4.2, Asc4.3 and Asc7.1 QTL were defined by four of these candidate genes, while another three candidate genes occurred within 1.0 LOD confidence intervals. Epistasis involving QTLÂ Ã—Â background marker and background markerÂ Ã—Â background marker interactions contributed to the disease response phenotypes observed in the two mapping populations. For each population, five pairwise interactions exceeded the 5Â % false discovery rate threshold. Two candidate genes were involved in significant pairwise interactions. Markers in three genomic regions were involved in two or more epistatic interactions. Therefore, this study has identified pea defence-related sequences that are candidates for resistance determination, and that may be useful for marker-assisted selection. The demonstration of epistasis informs breeders that the architecture of this complex quantitative resistance includes epistatic interactions with non-additive effects.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gail M.

f0643cc3738dd6e3f80348dd27a58a63c2efb825,Transcriptome analysis of the symbiosis-related genes between Funneliformis mosseae and Amorpha fruticosa,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can colonize and form associations with the roots of Amorpha fruticosa L. (desert false indigo). Various genes are induced during the symbiotic process. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing using RNA-seq was conducted for the first time for a comprehensive analysis of AMF-A. fruticosa symbionts at the transcript level. We obtained 12G of raw data from illumina sequencing and recovered 115,786 unigenes with an average length of 547Â bp, among them 41,848 of significance. A total of 2460 diffexpression genes were identified, including 1579 down-regulated and 881 up-regulated genes. A threshold for false discovery rate of <â€‰0.001 and fold change of >â€‰1 determined significant differences in gene expression. Using these criteria, we screened 285 significant differentially expressed genes, of which 82 were up-regulated and 203 down-regulated. The 82 up-regulated genes were classified according to their functions and assigned into seven categories: stress and defense, metabolism, signaling transduction, protein folding and degradation, energy, protein synthesis, and transcription. The 203 down-regulated genes were screened according to fold change >â€‰2, and 50 highly significant down-regulated genes were obtained related to stress and defense. The results of this study will provide a useful foundation for further investigation on the metabolic characteristics and molecular mechanisms of AMF associations with leguminous woody shrubs.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Xuan Liu"", ids = ""49544310""); list(name = ""Mingguo Jiang"", ids = ""6435450""); list(name = ""Fuqiang Song"", ids = ""4083101"")",,749ff471436c672372ad29f1c227ecf0561a585f; 36c74ce70387921461031962847946f492fca294; a1cc77ea92bf8bdf15554efbba3402364046e5dd; 9c501d4d772de6f6499eba3c5cb7184a664e6b35; 7a750106ea42334f700f2c984b10d83914757020; 253735cc583516674a104fa593f7e36564d06143; 8c5e074d54743539e0665b254434358e81a55b6c; 12ac17cb9e62d310b14b6ceb7856a09197b59d7e; 9313b6bb9b194f0ddf59dde9a91b9c7b68c38bee; f9a904fe18f745a8880587e4fd11b1e16de81461; fd39fac27402cdc437a8986cb36a8f9f331b46b2; be078e58ac1bc0b20a4fada432e317e5ea7d842a; 0d81615eb35513a8ecc94a688dba05e94b1ae0d0; 60f2b78a54197273fb564fa8383b9b80ebfaf607; 4683fd4c33bd4fd05b9a980b1117fe6922c63b2a; 4ef3f128c67c2c65c3ed22fd106ce92d13dd67b0; 1acd90fc1f14c16fbd77aac51183a86fdbf1edd5; e14bcc654eeaf542998a4c99881b6e5f8de0820d; aa36590d34861392b5c4eda118bf30ccfdc243e4; dc9d56384dca5ce8735653a119d2950a9a4a80ad; abbad68afc7a12a67be3644f8fb6d674596acc4c; a8b2f0763458c127eb184f0ea9068209d508d637; efde2d483fc00c48bc8097d28fbb065489669bcc; 482c7754d873253b5ad3f196e77a459cb0429316; c6be0aa47770cf2316d8de7c70614271d5158a1c,Journal of Forestry Research,30,483-495

Automated ventricular mapping with multi-atlas fluid image alignment reveals genetic effects in Alzheimer's disease, NeuroImage 40(2): 615-630); with this method, we calculated minimal numbers of subjects needed to detect correlations between clinical scores and ventricular maps. We also assessed correlations between emerging CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology and localizable deficits in the brain, in 80 AD, 80 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 80 healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Six expertly segmented images and their embedded parametric mesh surfaces were fluidly registered to each brain; segmentations were averaged within subjects to reduce errors. Surface-based statistical maps revealed powerful correlations between surface morphology and 4 variables: (1) diagnosis, (2) depression severity, (3) cognitive function at baseline, and (4) future cognitive decline over the following year. Cognitive function was assessed using the mini-mental state exam (MMSE), global and sum-of-boxes clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Lower CSF Abeta(1-42) protein levels, a biomarker of AD pathology assessed in 138 of the 240 subjects, were correlated with lateral ventricular expansion. Using false discovery rate (FDR) methods, 40 and 120 subjects, respectively, were needed to discriminate AD and MCI from normal groups. 120 subjects were required to detect correlations between ventricular enlargement and MMSE, global CDR, sum-of-boxes CDR and clinical depression scores. Ventricular expansion maps correlate with pathological and cognitive measures in AD, and may be useful in future imaging-based clinical trials.",2009,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yi-Yu Chou"", ids = ""1847961""); list(name = ""Natasha Lepore"", ids = ""1702792""); list(name = ""Christina Avedissian"", ids = ""2993738""); list(name = ""Sarah K.

76ab84c80aad2a6d856309c3fa2aada7604485ef,Regulatory gene expression in skeletal muscle of highly endurance-trained humans.,"AIM AND BACKGROUND
Changes in regulatory and structural gene expression provide the molecular basis for the adaptation of human skeletal muscle to endurance exercise.


HYPOTHESIS
The steady-state levels of multiple mRNAs mainly involved in regulatory functions differ between highly endurance-trained and untrained subjects in a muscle heavily recruited during the exercise.


METHODS
Biopsies from musculus vastus lateralis of seven untrained (UT) subjects [maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) = 39 mL kg-1 min-1] and seven trained (T) professional cyclists (VO2max = 72 mL kg-1 min-1) were analysed for the contents of 597 different mRNAs using commercially available cDNA arrays (Clontech no. 7740-1). Intra-individual expression profiles were compared by least-square linear regression analysis. Differences in gene expression between the two groups were tested for statistical significance using L1 regression analysis combined with the sign test on all permutations of scatter plots of log raw values from UT vs. T subjects.


RESULTS
Transcripts for 144 of 597 genes were sufficiently abundant to be analysed quantitatively. The expression profiles of the T group had a better intragroup correlation (R2) than those of the UT group (0.78 vs. 0.65, P < 0.05). An intergroup (T vs. UT) correlation of expression profiles gave an R2 of 0.71. Statistical analysis at a false discovery rate of 5% identified differential expression of nine cell-regulatory genes between T and UT. The mRNA levels of eight genes, including two DNA repair enzymes, transcription factors, signal transducers, a glycolytic enzyme and a factor involved in steroid hormone metabolism were increased in T vs. UT. Conversely, the mRNA of the tumour suppressor APC was downregulated with endurance training. Selective reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed the signal estimates from the array analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
The repetitive impact of the complex exercise stimuli in professional cyclists attenuated the interindividual differences in regulatory gene expression in skeletal muscle. Long-term nuclear reprogramming of regulatory gene expression seems to be characteristic of human musculus vastus lateralis in a highly endurance-trained steady state.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthias Wittwer"", ids = ""143625614""); list(name = ""Rudolf Billeter"", ids = ""145595225""); list(name = ""Hans Hoppeler"", ids = ""3927585""); list(name = ""Martin FlÃ¼ck"", ids = ""2908792"")",6ea33baeec632836df534d6fc9585284adcfad8d; 3cd31cf673b5cd21b13ab59f25be45b8e3cba758; 086091ae3068b6813723ee7be215c6de192396dd; 75bf6682595c253fbd86a6ccf8e25af2854a160b; 3b1e28f4b2b22f801e8bf2f4451a2f434bf3571e; 00e6e640ab76a66d326b5a6654fc2ba078de1f4c; 1557b6ae2887cd27966b1f2db108e8e37b4e9220; f6766a29632679f6c81a1cb0e7357c17128eb861; d7fe4c167c925566e8967f3e7e6718bddfc49010; c38b1e6613d8bdfaf589e668685fc0e2689e9106; 5a2831669c48d383af55882c84d306e4e8f08af6; c1929aec021ea945e89eade73c9caaa742bf68b1; 6f4670f6df8f53fefc1e851ea40c8afc938e4077; 52ecce2569799a992b24392d4506f3ae8631e349; e83a05d82f4a5eb9b668498c2ebb0a5c2f90bd86; 97a9b786bf04f2e14e54c25008863fe7c90ff88b; 9021b3d83426b5ea8e200ac6c0977496a871eaf5; f7e0030c5d54b88a6700fea854fd04d2cfd31b00; 3823a7f6f30614dce1582366ed57f5874f7839a2; 7163d030712ae838758827f85d43ae1365b3fcac; e90ae0d44d74d5aa059a7b7e76912db82fb2e5b3; 34678515a6dfd321ab8b97040df3ae7163dab90c; fa7ff665f54b55c5aa720b35c9d00fa16a94f2a6; 98c12296799941e9a70aafcff0d10410a9af9cca; 9ad9bef651e447d772ab8d3423efe55bc01945ad; 3ccc671b2970368441a5575cd0deab531cd622b6; 4bce6c7b6947b72eff89cdc6c18d6691ba9b49e6; fdd1eb79986c7fac29f34cdaeb50963b3dabfb77; 49deb4bceb55a388450c1a8686a1e1a49b88549a; f08f3731f4b74d5e3a4cfd952400f89f665603e2; 5c0bcbb30a5f0098a54e70e853bad3be819289cc; 721bfaf116ba7eccf4f0378cc7c011f748e221dd; 3800c2b7a2088f5b0ca7766f8e4f30d737c3090a; df3de3e6ecd234920dbd6da6dfc26252b05e42fd; 3894451c8c267ef72f6f28afa3b1c297112d8498; 0b52588215931f3e498556d5b5a04340c6da4b38; d7ee1aeea5c2421dcdb259930cf518e4e2199f96; bb6baa8dca154a87f609c92b3921b05bae6e4011; c45acac23280ba172d7b37a2029d27b66556a45f; 6ae5a02569f4f1fc30bd449431e41a403a8d86fb; d5a5581d50c5e91dd10942291ec142f695851625; 831b2c2ed463c96658ef3c0ed03ef1eece3a5b2d; 6439613aa1cf722f63e77a345c02cc734e0025d8; d23cc5973fa38dabbd64d5e723134b284c8ca021; 2578e1c39d52a3d08737b0ab3fc5b22e91529809; 58b7145bc6a7f5cfd8bee31381c33e105392203a; 724acdf1e20b2d392b29a019410f97a106dec659; 88e84afea8efcae1b583db121e3d8c01968a36de; 81e6ed7338ac6950f977b222c666705efc63b36e; 1e800abe75ed8d249a2cac502b2efa19ab29996b,,Acta physiologica Scandinavica,180 2,"

Studies on gene expression and regulation in these individuals are limited but significant, and have helped researchers and clinicians to understand the interrelationships between HIV and its host. Methods We collected CD4 T-cell samples from two elite controllers (ECs), two HIV-positive infected patients (HPs), and two healthy controls (HCs) to perform second-generation transcriptome sequencing. Using the Cufflinks software, we calculated the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million fragments mapped (FPKM) and identified differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), with corrected P value < 0.05 (based on a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). We then constructed a protein-protein interaction network using cytoHubba and a long non-coding RNA-mRNA co-expression network based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results In total, 1109 linear correlations of DE lncRNAs targeting DE mRNAs were found and several interesting interactions were identified as being associated with viral infections and immune responses within the networks based on these correlations. Among these lncRNA-mRNA relationships, hub mRNAs including HDAC6, MAPK8, MAPK9, ATM and their corresponding annotated co-expressed lncRNAs presented strong correlations with the MAPK-NF-kappa B pathway, which plays a role in the reactivation and replication of the virus. Conclusions Using RNA-sequencing, we systematically analyzed the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs from CD4+ T cells from ECs, HPs, and HCs, and constructed a co-expression network based on the relationships among DE transcripts and database annotations. This was the first study to examine gene transcription in elite controllers and to study their functional relationships.

8c9e4b2d1660484a406febe81b6b8585dbc29c61,Improving software performance for peptide electron transfer dissociation data analysis by implementation of charge state- and sequence-dependent scoring.,"The use of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation for analysis of peptides eluting in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry experiments is increasingly common and can allow identification of many peptides and proteins in complex mixtures. Peptide identification is performed through the use of search engines that attempt to match spectra to peptides from proteins in a database. However, software for the analysis of ETD fragmentation data is currently less developed than equivalent algorithms for the analysis of the more ubiquitous collision-induced dissociation fragmentation spectra. In this study, a new scoring system was developed for analysis of peptide ETD fragmentation data that varies the ion type weighting depending on the precursor ion charge state and peptide sequence. This new scoring regime was applied to the analysis of data from previously published results where four search engines (Mascot, Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA), Spectrum Mill, and X!Tandem) were compared (Kandasamy, K., Pandey, A., and Molina, H. (2009) Evaluation of several MS/MS search algorithms for analysis of spectra derived from electron transfer dissociation experiments. Anal. Chem. 81, 7170-7180).

77d7c53445a7ce1cf9b07d013a22453a9600bbe5,The acute effects of fine particulate matter constituents on circulating inflammatory biomarkers in healthy adults.,"BACKGROUND
Systemic inflammation is considered one of the key mechanisms in the development of cardiovascular diseases induced by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. However, evidence concerning the effects of various PM2.5 constituents on circulating inflammatory biomarkers were limited and inconsistent.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the associations of short-term exposure to a variety of PM2.5 constituents with circulating inflammatory biomarkers.


METHODS
We conducted a panel study from May to October 2016 among 40 healthy adults in Shanghai, China. We monitored the concentrations of 27 constituents of PM2.5. We applied linear mixed-effect models to analyze the associations of PM2.5 and its constituents with 7 inflammatory biomarkers, and further assessed the robustness of the associations by fitting models adjusting for PM2.5 mass and/or their collinearity. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate was used to correct for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
The associations of PM2.5 were strongest at lag 0 d with tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), at lag 1 d with interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-17A, at lag 02 d with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). After correcting for multiple comparisons in all models, Cl-, K+, Si, K, As, and Pb were significantly associated with interleukin-8; SO42- and Se were marginally significantly associated with interleukin-8; SO42-, As, and Se were marginally significantly associated with TNF-Î±; and Si, K, Zn, As, Se, and Pb were marginally significantly associated with MCP-1.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggested that some constituents (SO42-, Cl-, K+, and some elements) might be mainly responsible for systemic inflammation triggered by short-term PM2.5 exposure.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qingli Zhang"", ids = ""2606108""); list(name = ""Yue Ting Niu"", ids = ""31633529""); list(name = ""Yongjie Xia"", ids = ""3500626""); list(name = ""Xiaoning Lei"", ids = ""13145969""); list(name = ""Wei-dong Wang"", ids = ""49336871""); list(name = ""Juntao Huo"", ids = ""9349212""); list(name = ""Qianbiao Zhao"", ids = ""14334170""); list(name = ""Yihua Zhang"", ids = ""48379423""); list(name = ""Yusen Duan"", ids = ""12697731""); list(name = ""Jing Cai"", ids = ""48979718""); list(name = ""Zhekang Ying"", ids = ""2892169""); list(name = ""Shanqun Li"", ids = ""122616456""); list(name = ""Ren-jie Chen"", ids = ""120347074""); list(name = ""Qingyan Fu"", ids = ""7958400""); list(name = ""Haidong Kan"", ids = ""2136813"")",,,The Science of the total environment,707,"

a58ea5a8b8dcf04c77265940569e5d05f23bd312,Protein Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality in the Community,"BACKGROUND
The discovery of novel and highly predictive biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has the potential to improve risk-stratification methods and may be informative regarding biological pathways contributing to disease.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We used a discovery proteomic platform that targeted high-value proteins for CVD to ascertain 85 circulating protein biomarkers in 3523 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age, 62Â years; 53% women). Using multivariable-adjusted Cox models to account for clinical variables, we found 8 biomarkers associated with incident atherosclerotic CVD, 18 with incident heart failure, 38 with all-cause mortality, and 35 with CVD death (false discovery rate, q<0.05 for all; P-value ranges, 9.8Ã—10-34 to 3.6Ã—10-2). Notably, a number of regulators of metabolic and adipocyte homeostasis were associated with cardiovascular events, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), leptin, and adipsin. In a multimarker approach that accounted for clinical factors, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) was associated with all outcomes. In addition, N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and leptin were associated with incident heart failure, and C-type lectin domain family 3 member B (CLEC3B; tetranectin), N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide, arabinogalactan protein 1 (AGP1), soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2), uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (UCMGP), kallikrein B1 (KLKB1), IGFBP2, IGF1, leptin receptor, and cystatin-C were associated with all-cause mortality in a multimarker model.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified numerous protein biomarkers that predicted cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality, including biomarkers representing regulators of metabolic homeostasis and inflammatory pathways.

786f3d5f25f27eb450192bce03976f73dcabcd89,Gains from modelling dependence of rainfall variables into a stochastic model: application of the copula approach at several sites,"Abstract. Since the last decade, copulas have become more and more widespread in the construction of hydrological models. Unlike the multivariate statistics which are traditionally used, this tool enables scientists to model different dependence structures without drawbacks. The authors propose to apply copulas to improve the performance of an existing model. The hourly rainfall stochastic model SHYPRE is based on the simulation of descriptive variables. It generates long series of hourly rainfall and enables the estimation of distribution quantiles for different climates. The paper focuses on the relationship between two variables describing the rainfall signal. First, Kendall's tau is estimated on each of the 217 rain gauge stations in France, then the False Discovery Rate procedure is used to define stations for which the dependence is significant. Among three usual archimedean copulas, a unique 2-copula is chosen to model this dependence for any station. Modelling dependence leads to an obvious improvement in the reproduction of the standard and extreme statistics of maximum rainfall, especially for the sub-daily rainfall. An accuracy test for the extreme values shows the good asymptotic behaviour of the new rainfall generator version and the impacts of the copula choice on extreme quantile estimation.",2012,Geology,"list(name = ""Philippe Cantet"", ids = ""49757655""); list(name = ""Patrick Arnaud"", ids = ""67241266"")",043247a0e12a48aba3103b899e36c21cb3bd357e; 352a553557ec5e495922528a8f0c4b6b2a768661,4d0ed22e30050bb92ceab5004e6f6193ae560342; 5d107c992f5d36c1588f041e955855615a78fdf2; 9a35f57264ba424449667ff09e3e1f20e6d1dbc5; 40b54042943167d0dcb254aaddc6edcf1074b037; 0943ff411f44ffd956ea5f6f56e4a6154e6d861a; 10c264695d6a78cab42f8ab6d246811649d76379; 99fb90aa71487f265f7d991024ec0df295f32a02; c615aea8a4626bc85626feb8af39510273ac0035; d767abc43e4ea5c39ab62c4c889c25e1a337529c; 9b557809b30d9635ed84fadeed8a46ce8f334cb1; 3e2375246bd806d7a2f3c32835d6e896f07f6a12; f6e1e32428d94cf8dff9316e919db72c8b8dbe06; 55065e69af3feb49951990c6a51d6fb93fc4f5b2; 5532aa1962f7523b5cf4f63fc18b3df87b73f37a; 06cba02b7c5c09961361327386090551982f37ff; 8a611f94aade8abdbcd2795f9a9bab7078a7dcb1; 25e6c0fc69c2dd5c3242556564db18ce73b6c660; 290e9106b1300d77bbad8d5946d80aac4a880dab; f1cf91b300f74ce52b00a0260c22240acc722620; 233519917cbe25f9a4d8c7907299366944e79af6; a92308740d21a5784f7aa4ae1dfc8048ce522c8a; 26e4a97f95e5e175b0b9e9cc7a4f4112c0333565; 0e4ed63a97d5d1836f60c571625bcedefd4b5410; 32f56a6b28b944cacfbe144f421b869e448473d3; 80bc1ebccbfaf6e8f7be657a0e667f33326a44d0; 69dc160e2861b0d6b9bcb8d3d058593326c8d5e9; 6733e22b52d8a86988a36be7404cd38fd5b8a66f; 94de70bea08e4c730989d1a98db918e3f7a3d785; 175559689ab7f9fc7434ba3f4b1db3dcb0a4ad59; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fcf3a5cc07ce2e673598b0b9437c7fc92692d0ab; dcf9f1c1878e06d7efd4002fd049223963bfe2a0; 1f300ac1338fc935e93af4767544204126cd3cb7; 41808c2f5210133b50cfd99457a61eb4ec4c6c2e; c1073991564090cc9edd835e9723e8f3b82f124f; 46c0fc8f157a07c63334dc999a9cdb272e873ce4,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions,9,11227-11266
d4e9d5730f722cfec45b0a8c832953d3f2c88fa4,XMM Cluster Survey: X-ray source identification using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"[ABRIDGED] The XMM Cluster Survey (XCS) is predicted to detect thousands of clusters observed serendipitously in XMM-Newton pointings. We investigate automating optical follow-up of cluster candidates using the SDSS public archive, concentrating on 42 XMM observations that overlap the SDSS First Data Release. Restricting to the inner 11 arcminutes of the XMM field-of-view gives 637 unique X-ray sources across a 3.09 deg^2 region with SDSS coverage. The log N-log S relation indicates survey completeness to a flux limit of around 1x10^{-14} erg s^-1 cm^-2. We have cross-correlated XMM point sources with SDSS quasars, finding 103 unique matches from which we determine a matching radius of 3.8 arcseconds. Using this we make immediate identifications of roughly half of all XMM point sources as quasars (159) or stars (55). We have estimated the typical error on SDSS-determined photometric cluster redshifts to be 5% for relaxed systems, and 11% for disturbed systems, by comparing them to spectroscopic redshifts for eight previously-known clusters. The error for disturbed systems may be problematic for cluster surveys relying on photometric redshifts alone. We use the False Discovery Rate to select 41 XMM sources (25 point-like, 16 extended) statistically associated with SDSS galaxy overdensities. Of the extended sources, 5 are new cluster candidates and 11 are previously-known clusters (0.044 1 clusters rediscovered by our wavelet-based detection software. These results show that the SDSS can provide useful automated follow-up to X-ray cluster surveys, but cannot provide all the optical follow-up necessary for X-ray cluster surveys.",2004,Physics,"list(name = ""Kate R.

0a0e5cf5df20a8379accf69e6afbc1288d041ac9,Integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles to identify biomarkers in serum of lung cancer.,"We used blood serum samples collected from 31 lung cancer (LC) patients and 29 healthy volunteers in this study. Levels of serum metabolites were qualitative quantified with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the data were analyzed by partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, we performed pathway-based analysis utilizing metabolites presented at differential abundance between the LC serum samples and the normal healthy serum samples for systematical investigation on the metabolic alterations associated with LC pathogenesis. Finally, we analyzed the significantly enriched pathways as well as their relevant differentially expressed messenger RNAs, and drawn a correlation network plot to identify the serum metabolic biomarkers and the significantly altered metabolic pathways for LC. GC-MS analysis showed that 23 of the 169 metabolites identified were significantly different. PLS-DA model revealed that 13 of these metabolites were with variable importanceâ€‰>â€‰1, and particularly five were with area under curveâ€‰>â€‰0.9. Pathway-based analysis demonstrated that five of eight enriched metabolic pathways were statistically significant with false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Lastly, the correlation networks between these pathways and their related genes suggested that 29 genes had correlation degreeâ€‰>â€‰10, which were mainly engaged in the purine metabolism. In conclusion, we identified indole-3-lactate, erythritol, adenosine-5-phosphate, paracetamol and threitol as serum metabolic biomarkers for LC through metabolomics analysis. Besides, we identified the purine metabolism as the significantly altered metabolic pathway in LC with the help of transcriptomics analysis.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Quan Ying Sun"", ids = ""49144470""); list(name = ""Wei Zhao"", ids = ""144122129""); list(name = ""Lei Wang"", ids = ""48170277""); list(name = ""Fei Guo"", ids = ""49078428""); list(name = ""Dongjian Song"", ids = ""23470732""); list(name = ""Qian Zhang"", ids = ""35166234""); list(name = ""Da Zhang"", ids = ""49357017""); list(name = ""Yingzhong Fan"", ids = ""7888744""); list(name = ""Jiaxiang Wang"", ids = ""48094127"")",8a24038d6728970cf89170fd5a3d9023c78277ad; d547bbc093c9a61e389ec76ef28a0a007a5252c1,,Journal of cellular biochemistry,,
73b889be4ad0e386531b34143aa38e83f78f2a99,Sample size determination in microarray experiments for class comparison and prognostic classification.,"Determining sample sizes for microarray experiments is important but the complexity of these experiments, and the large amounts of data they produce, can make the sample size issue seem daunting, and tempt researchers to use rules of thumb in place of formal calculations based on the goals of the experiment. Here we present formulae for determining sample sizes to achieve a variety of experimental goals, including class comparison and the development of prognostic markers. Results are derived which describe the impact of pooling, technical replicates and dye-swap arrays on sample size requirements. These results are shown to depend on the relative sizes of different sources of variability. A variety of common types of experimental situations and designs used with single-label and dual-label microarrays are considered. We discuss procedures for controlling the false discovery rate.

c9e718ecccc94d8445edf904acd8e5edf258d0e4,Statistical validation of peptide identifications in large-scale proteomics using the target-decoy database search strategy and flexible mixture modeling.,"Reliable statistical validation of peptide and protein identifications is a top priority in large-scale mass spectrometry based proteomics. PeptideProphet is one of the computational tools commonly used for assessing the statistical confidence in peptide assignments to tandem mass spectra obtained using database search programs such as SEQUEST, MASCOT, or X! TANDEM. We present two flexible methods, the variable component mixture model and the semiparametric mixture model, that remove the restrictive parametric assumptions in the mixture modeling approach of PeptideProphet. Using a control protein mixture data set generated on an linear ion trap Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) mass spectrometer, we demonstrate that both methods improve parametric models in terms of the accuracy of probability estimates and the power to detect correct identifications controlling the false discovery rate to the same degree. The statistical approaches presented here require that the data set contain a sufficient number of decoy (known to be incorrect) peptide identifications, which can be obtained using the target-decoy database search strategy.",2008,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Hyungwon Choi"", ids = ""33372512""); list(name = ""Debashis Ghosh"", ids = ""145165051""); list(name = ""Alexey I.

768097b542a331f8ad86367754aadee1caa6da72,Brain perfusion correlates of cognitive and nigrostriatal functions in de novo Parkinsonâ€™s disease,"PurposeSubtle cognitive impairment is recognized in the first stages of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), including executive, memory and visuospatial dysfunction, but its pathophysiological basis is still debated.MethodsTwenty-six consecutive, drug-naÃ¯ve, de novo PD patients underwent an extended neuropsychological battery, dopamine transporter (DAT) and brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We previously reported that nigrocaudate impairment correlates with executive functions, and nigroputaminal impairment with visuospatial abilities. Here perfusion SPECT was first compared between the PD group and age-matched controls (CTR). Then, perfusion SPECT was correlated with both DAT SPECT and four neuropsychological factors by means of voxel-based analysis (SPM8) with a height threshold of pâ€‰<â€‰0.005 at peak level and pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 false discovery rate-corrected at cluster level. Both perfusion and DAT SPECT images were flipped in order to have the more affected hemisphere (MAH), defined clinically, on the same side.ResultsSignificant hypoperfusion was found in an occipital area of the MAH in PD patients as compared to CTR. Executive functions directly correlated with brain perfusion in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus in the less affected hemisphere (LAH), while verbal memory directly correlated with perfusion in the precuneus, inferior parietal lobule and superior temporal gyrus in the LAH. Furthermore, positive correlation was highlighted between nigrocaudate and nigroputaminal impairment and brain perfusion in the precuneus, posterior cingulate and parahippocampal gyri of the LAH.ConclusionThese data support the evidence showing an early involvement of the cholinergic system in the early cognitive dysfunction and point to a more relevant role of parietal lobes and posterior cingulate in executive functions in PD.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Flavio Nobili"", ids = ""1883019""); list(name = ""Dario Arnaldi"", ids = ""5082223""); list(name = ""Claudio Campus"", ids = ""47804814""); list(name = ""Michele Ferrara"", ids = ""145970723""); list(name = ""Fabrizio De Carli"", ids = ""4710964""); list(name = ""Andrea Brugnolo"", ids = ""7023043""); list(name = ""Barbara Dessi"", ids = ""5741803""); list(name = ""Nicola Girtler"", ids = ""4000123""); list(name = ""Silvia Morbelli"", ids = ""84405332""); list(name = ""Giovanni Abruzzese"", ids = ""4585286""); list(name = ""Gianmario Sambuceti"", ids = ""2242364""); list(name = ""Guido Rodriguez"", ids = ""144030987"")",03fac4eede5b39ac345ad896e9b0de7b02ed6b90; c3fa401c0fdcca25f6ad50eb9ab78e07a0255a70; d004c49ab07a395abddee137cfb421f52a7888a7; d5cc8309baec3e909c6e120eea1b30fb6bb95572; a4cb6101e4dda9abbd8b3e285b0c94ae02b11b73; 6e352113e9349a290ed05233bf8a65ce14c543c9; 206a694cc8e022eb383def23b94de32554f5009b; 25e62493365382b59d46b70ac1c31d77c449aae8; 71dd7e29487405ed2e99cc82f44f0ed167a42e40; 35c2d8eac5909122580d9c924892c8a4f08f4c4b; d156c648291dd96f1f19cca0bb30080d341e3615; 72074e9f994ecaabc6184f241c5eac4605f5db8f,c2db24191fe2e3be767533732bb7956504face06; 52dffc747a45906cf4c9c0de1a07ecd8824cf324; 0360f20bad6d1c47f60a807a8b59cb3b4bf4e897; 4dfd5300ed404960676ecf47775c2fb3ac8ec487; 01e86e637d23ea17b04a763e4c86cb4f8b34c34f; a4bb8979825d0d7b4d02049ee02411280694b711; acb9862bef7dd443349956d698b10a895c5eb60a; de33dc009465434df1c8be6e1595c393371b1d03; 11faad065f3a876dc6189d5155e31b55f0a73ac6; da13525326a64bda23030e2271fe05bb03886ee7; 16bfc125b644042ea973a632f798e8b65a791dae; 2b6a49ab3ebb39ef2d7e8bba02814c14342566c5; 3580894d713711a435a6a52a79209bf806cab8cd; c3a2641459342aa7953c4167924c869cbaa82fea; 62539e6c4c149375eb2b5c2c504f91dcfc10b2c8; 6ba94a0be03838fc009b4b869a9bbef6a864e72f; a50d9c832d1e1eb4f9ff35eff1046683b41e5ad4; a25f37050eeb6cbe01f21b5ec1431e2af8f6cd8a; 2733fe10aef38742af16ca4ab8e7159fdb2b7125; eb4f70784efe293a18baaaa9a86807413aba8616; 688fadd96d97b5c9754069b5eebf67298caf6246; f4567397f0c5c03f8caab10fad4acf93dd6d19ab; bcab0b778e82f625056ddd16164f4933df201668; 41bcfca420a9f98aa710e7e5f91986d8765298d0; 7b38f63c3794d242b3ef4dc10697a0c471f062b9; f1e701a27780b1d444dee0a98d555edf3c73a8ac; 60b7734a0ac6ab87b427e3ebb97ece57330a5eb2; b646eb82ef8cee0e0f6b8b5157c3fa719c467a6e; d50b859dbdbf9fb4d777e4adcd0a48b836092309; 898fc8c0aafe8c23af111d2e3dade702982d0a3c; aacac33983b1dfde0fbc8b3c375f34d6eccdbf67; a560eb791951d7f3047af045b20f2908c02f4ca0; ce28e1ad486431e6a62210bf84b1c35e8ae80539; 01166d7230c0fe708830b5acd86eec8eee285dc7; a85ef1931d188a6ad4a44c2b8b96e2a164a8055c; b1de72e9b0b124df26f07c9815fd6a4e95153df2; 9772c0cd9190b08642a9189c825e80e285f075d4; 0b7500f04c98d0c5215736da438f59c36159748d; 37ded16f14f57eaf3c8bfd7db063fc21d8c10d8a; 7ac67ff0f59585ad3b31d22424c2cef72e20a27d; 8d97bff889ce5ac52f30ee60aa307e057860e1ff; 977d6128653b30f4f2b925b8b5ef1ae854793937; 88147fecb3bea806b920f7cd14d438fb5f08c59b; 0456efe3666c2550dcfe84c910c39def24606734; 060e04ab5bdfa24a77484f1449a07b64db7c0873; 439226133f84147881c3f10c317c081d2a5f5931; a8f6ad62fc8443127bcf582a6cc5021fb255b47e; 5d16bc3f267472acf32fb028e21a47f5aff1bc51; 384b315270de0bcdb24724088d60475c9e54b118; bd965ab160be596e367a0594c6775e4da7fdbc1d; f1d97d6f22e2e129e2fd1fa3583012257ca99266; 30bc14fac3decdfd1071c2b3a2dcf90c571920ac; defa47cc017c92a2bd2baf8c5961393d43a5eb13; 471e6b7dee3d912a940298ec9c89cea4fdf78ec7; 1811194eb49da9526fb41536721445f3b13ce5c9,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,38,2209-2218
7022bb5ca6b383a43b23800fd3c503053398d36a,Significance Analysis of ROC Indices for Comparing Diagnostic Markers: Applications to Gene Microarray Data,"Abstract A common objective in microarray experiments is to select genes that are differentially expressed between two classes (two treatment groups). Selection of differentially expressed genes involves two steps. The first step is to calculate a discriminatory score that will rank the genes in order of evidence of differential expressions. The second step is to determine a cutoff for the ranked scores. Summary indices of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve provide relative measures for a ranking of differential expressions. This article proposes using the hypothesis-testing approach to compute the raw p-values and/or adjusted p-values for three ROC discrimination measures. A cutoff p-value can be determined from the (ranked) p-values or the adjusted p-values to select differentially expressed genes. To quantify the degree of confidence in the selected top-ranked genes, the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) over the selected gene set and the â€œType Iâ€ (false positive) error probability for each selected gene are estimated.

5892fb5cde0b7f8298193eb1e2081a08cd40706b,Mutations increasing Drosophila melanogaster life span.,"MAGWIRE, MICHAEL MAHLON. Mutations Increasing Drosophila melanogaster Life Span. (Under the direction of Trudy F. C. Mackay.) Better living conditions and advances in medicine have made it possible for humans to live considerably longer than before. This has uncovered many health problems associated with age. By identifying genes involved in the limitation of life span, we may better understand the processes that lead to aging. In model organisms, we can use mutagenesis to discover mutations that increase life span, and hence infer that the wild-type allele limits life span by some means. We have assessed longevity in a collection of 1332 co-isogenic gene-trap P-element insertion lines and determined changes in life span of each insert line relative to the corresponding control line. Significant lines were determined via two different methods of analysis: A 95% confidence interval was established based on deviations of the mutant life spans from the controls and Dunnettâ€™s two tailed t-tests were used to examine differences between mutant and control in each individual block. Based on the 95% confidence interval, 139 inserts displayed an increase in life span and 194 inserts a decrease. Using Dunnettâ€™s, 70 lines increased in life span, while 270 decreased in life span. An additional 48 increased longevity lines were close enough to meeting Dunnettâ€™s criteria to be considered for additional investigation. Combining these two analyses, we chose 83 inserts associated with increased life span for a secondary screen using an additional twelve replicates. 58 of these lines remained significant. We have determined the P-element insertion site for 50 of these lines. Starvation resistance, chill coma recovery time and climbing activity were measured on the lines remaining significant after the the secondary screen to identify pleiotropic effects. A positive correlation was found for males between life span and starvation resistance as well as between life span and chill coma recovery. Females only displayed a correlation between life span and chill coma recovery, which was negative. None of the lines indicated increased fitness for all phenotypes, indicating there may be some type of trade-off. There also appears to be a lot of pleiotropic variation depending on background and sex. Ten of the lines, all with the same parental background, were chosen for a half-diallel cross to identify epistasis between the mutants. There were substantial epistatic interactions between all ten lines. Furthermore, males and females displayed vastly different patterns of epistasis, again indicating major differences in life span regulation between the sexes. Finally, a subset of seven of the lines used in the epistatic study, in addition to the corresponding parental control, were chosen for microarray analysis to look for possible pathways and novel genes involved in increasing life span. 1,996 probe sets were significant at a false discovery rate q-value threshold of q â‰¤ 0.0001. Tukeys tests were carried out for these probe sets to determine how each of the seven mutant backgrounds differed compared to the control and each other. In addition, each mutant background was compared individually with the control to identify any changes in expression. Gene ontologies were determined for each of the lines to identify over-represented biological functions which would indicate possible longevity pathways. Dozens of pathways were suggested, including several novel pathways.

bf84db7197b5336225efd88a34bfd590603e7ee0,Multiple Testing Methods For ChIP - Chip High Density Oligonucleotide Array Data,"Cawley et al. (2004) have recently mapped the locations of binding sites for three transcription factors along human chromosomes 21 and 22 using ChIP-Chip experiments. ChIP-Chip experiments are a new approach to the genomewide identification of transcription factor binding sites and consist of chromatin (Ch) immunoprecipitation (IP) of transcription factor-bound genomic DNA followed by high density oligonucleotide hybridization (Chip) of the IP-enriched DNA. We investigate the ChIP-Chip data structure and propose methods for inferring the location of transcription factor binding sites from these data. The proposed methods involve testing for each probe whether it is part of a bound sequence using a scan statistic that takes into account the spatial structure of the data. Different multiple testing procedures are considered for controlling the familywise error rate and false discovery rate. A nested-Bonferroni adjustment, which is more powerful than the traditional Bonferroni adjustment when the test statistics are dependent, is discussed. Simulation studies show that taking into account the spatial structure of the data substantially improves the sensitivity of the multiple testing procedures. Application of the proposed methods to ChIP-Chip data for transcription factor p53 identified many potential target binding regions along human chromosomes 21 and 22. Among these identified regions, 18% fall within a 3 kb vicinity of the 5'UTR of a known gene or CpG island and 31% fall between the codon start site and the codon end site of a known gene but not inside an exon. More than half of these potential target sequences contain the p53 consensus binding site or very close matches to it. Moreover, these target segments include the 13 experimentally verified p53 binding regions of Cawley et al. (2004), as well as 49 additional regions that show higher hybridization signal than these 13 experimentally verified regions.",2006,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""SÃ¼ndÃ¼z KeleÅŸ"", ids = ""152766143""); list(name = ""Mark J. van der Laan"", ids = ""145099512""); list(name = ""Sandrine Dudoit"", ids = ""2225350""); list(name = ""Simon E.

0cabd7c8ae7d8bb5533f920da6b4a5670977c6fb,Population transcriptomics of Drosophila melanogaster females,"BackgroundVariation at the level of gene expression is abundant in natural populations and is thought to contribute to the adaptive divergence of populations and species. Gene expression also differs considerably between males and females. Here we report a microarray analysis of gene expression variation among females of 16 Drosophilamelanogaster strains derived from natural populations, including eight strains from the putative ancestral range in sub-Saharan Africa and eight strains from Europe. Gene expression variation among males of the same strains was reported previously.ResultsWe detected relatively low levels of expression polymorphism within populations, but much higher expression divergence between populations. A total of 569 genes showed a significant expression difference between the African and European populations at a false discovery rate of 5%. Genes with significant over-expression in Europe included the insecticide resistance gene Cyp6g1, as well as genes involved in proteolysis and olfaction. Genes with functions in carbohydrate metabolism and vision were significantly over-expressed in the African population. There was little overlap between genes expressed differently between populations in females and males.ConclusionsOur results suggest that adaptive changes in gene expression have accompanied the out-of-Africa migration of D. melanogaster. Comparison of female and male expression data indicates that the vast majority of genes differing in expression between populations do so in only one sex and suggests that most regulatory adaptation has been sex-specific.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lena MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""47864994""); list(name = ""Stephan Hutter"", ids = ""34242333""); list(name = ""Rayna Stamboliyska"", ids = ""48644300""); list(name = ""Sarah S.

1057fdb059bd86545d84328e7581149f17b42669,Sociodemographic patterning in the oral microbiome of a diverse sample of New Yorkers,"1.1 Purpose Variations in the oral microbiome are potentially implicated in social inequalities in oral disease, cancers, and metabolic disease. We describe sociodemographic variation of oral microbiomes in a diverse sample. 1.2 Methods We performed 16S rRNA sequencing on mouthwash specimens in a subsample (n=282) of the 2013-14 population-based New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NYC-HANES). We examined differential abundance of 216 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and alpha and beta diversity by age, sex, income, education, nativity, and race/ethnicity. For comparison, we also examined differential abundance by diet, smoking status, and oral health behaviors. 1.3 Results 69 OTUs were differentially abundant by any sociodemographic variable (false discovery rate < 0.01), including 27 by race/ethnicity, 21 by family income, 19 by education, three by sex. We also found 49 differentially abundant by smoking status, 23 by diet, 12 by oral health behaviors. Genera differing for multiple sociodemographic characteristics included Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium. 1.4 Conclusions We identified oral microbiome variation consistent with health inequalities, with more taxa differing by race/ethnicity than diet, and more by SES variables than oral health behaviors. Investigation is warranted into possible mediating effects of the oral microbiome in social disparities in oral, metabolic and cancers. Highlights Most microbiome studies to date have had minimal sociodemographic variability, limiting what is known about associations of social factors and the microbiome. We examined the oral microbiome in a population-based sample of New Yorkers with wide sociodemographic variation. Numerous taxa were differentially abundant by race/ethnicity, income, education, marital status, and nativity. Frequently differentially abundant taxa include Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, and Prevotella, which are associated with oral and systemic disease. Mediation of health disparities by microbial factors may represent an important intervention site to reduce health disparities, and should be explored in prospective studies.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Audrey Renson"", ids = ""11545123""); list(name = ""Heidi E.

Understanding the molecular events leading to metastatic disease is foundational for developing effective treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize single nucleotide variations (SNVs) acquired during metastasis. Primary and metastatic tumor samples were obtained from a dog with spontaneously occurring osteosarcoma, treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor total RNA was isolated and processed using standard techniques. Created libraries were used for paired-end sequencing (2 lanes of 2x80 per sample), in the Illumina Platform. Alignments to canFam2 reference sequence were performed using the TopHat splice aligner and quantified expression levels for all canFam2 ENSEMBL gene models using CuffLinks with GC-correction and upper-quartile normalization. After SNV discovery via custom pipeline, quantification of their abundance was performed by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Fisher exact tests, on SNVs read counts. Thesequence data were visualized using Integrated Genome Viewer, while Polyphen2 was used to assess the potential impact of SNVs in protein function. Tumor samples from a 6-year-old neutered male Golden Retriever, diagnosed with spontaneously-occurringosteosarcoma, treated with surgery and adjuvant cheemotherapy were used. Lung metastases were confirmed to be metastatic osteosarcoma. Tumor RNA of adequate quantity and quality was isolated from primary and metastatic lesions. Seventy-four and 89 million pair-end reads were generated from the primary and the metastatic site, respectively. There were 13,292 heterologous and 19,780 homologous SNVs identified in the primary tumor, while 48,453 heterologous and 72,737 homologous SNVs identified in the metastatic tumor. At 20% false discovery rate, we identified 190 SNVs with increased abundance in the metastatic site compared to the primary site. The majority of these SNVs (>95%) were nearly or fully homozygous in the metastatic sample and either heterozygous or low abundance in the primary tumor sample. These results suggest frequent and potentially convergent loss-of-heterozygosity in the metastasis compared to the primary. More specifically, a missense SNV with high probability of affecting protein function was identified in p53, only in the metastatic sample. A putativealternative splicing event was identified in BRCA1, skipping exons 4, 5, and 6. A missense SNV was identified in BRCA2, with 1/9 reads having a T>C change in the primary tumor, but 25/25 reads having the same variant in the metastatic site (adjusted p Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

02e1590a5ef926682b5e80840d8ef79413320cd7,Robust split-plot designs for model misspecification,"ABSTRACT Many existing methods for constructing optimal split-plot designs, such as D-optimal or A-optimal designs, focus only on minimizing the variance of the parameter estimates for the fitted model. However, the true model is usually more complicated; hence, the fitted model is often misspecified. If significant effects not included in the model exist, then the estimates could be highly biased. Therefore a good split-plot design should be able to simultaneously control the variance and the bias of the estimates.

We here propose the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method, which creates for each predictor variable a pair of mirror variables by adding and subtracting a randomly generated Gaussian random variable, and proceeds with a certain regression method, such as the ordinary least-square or the Lasso. The mirror variables naturally lead to a test statistic highly effective for controlling the FDR. Under a weak dependence assumption, we show that the FDR can be controlled at a user-specified level asymptotically. It is shown that the GM method is more powerful than many existing methods in selecting important variables, subject to the control of FDR especially under the case when high correlations among the covariates exist.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xin Xing"", ids = ""144062936""); list(name = ""Zhigen Zhao"", ids = ""2941525""); list(name = ""Jun S.

31776596e6919925bc9e789b34565b152aef67b2,Birth weight-for-gestational age is associated with DNA methylation at birth and in childhood,"BackgroundBoth higher and lower fetal growth are associated with cardio-metabolic health later in life, suggesting that prenatal developmental programming determines long-term cardiovascular disease risk. Epigenetic mechanisms, which orchestrate fetal growth and development, may offer insight on the early programming of health and disease. We investigated whether birth weight-for-gestational is associated with DNA methylation at birth and mid-childhood, measured via the Infinium 450K array.Methods/resultsParticipants were from Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort of pregnant women and their children in Eastern Massachusetts. After exclusion of participants with maternal type 1 or 2 diabetes and gestational age <34Â weeks, we used DNA methylation assays from 476 venous umbilical cord blood samples and a subset of 235 who additionally had peripheral blood samples available in mid-childhood (age 7â€“10Â years). Among 392,918 CpG sites analyzed, birth weight-for-gestational age z-score was associated with cord blood DNA methylation at 34 CpGs (false discovery rate Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), after adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, parity, delivery mode, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational diabetes status, child sex, and estimated cord blood cell proportions based on a cord blood reference panel. Two of these CpGs were previously reported in epigenome-wide analyses of birth weight, and several other CpGs map to genes relevant to fetal growth and development. Namely, higher birth weight-for-gestational age was associated with higher methylation at four CpGs at the PBX1 locus (e.g., Î² (95% CI) for lead signal at cg06750897â€‰=â€‰1.9 (1.2, 2.6)), which encodes a transcription factor that regulates embryonic development. Birth weight-for-gestational age was also associated with mid-childhood blood DNA methylation at four of the 34 CpGs identified in cord blood analyses, including sites at the PBX1 locus described.ConclusionsWe identified CpG sites where birth weight-for-gestational age was associated with DNA methylation at birth, and for a subset of these sites, birth weight-for-gestational age was also associated with DNA methylation at mid-childhood.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Golareh Agha"", ids = ""34922753""); list(name = ""Hanine Hajj"", ids = ""3468888""); list(name = ""Sheryl L Rifas-Shiman"", ids = ""1398121015""); list(name = ""Allan C.

b7b6e37aaeaed68849c19b733c1a9bcebbb82bc8,MCAST: scanning for cis-regulatory motif clusters,"UNLABELLED
Precise regulatory control of genes, particularly in eukaryotes, frequently requires the joint action of multiple sequence-specific transcription factors. A cis-regulatory module (CRM) is a genomic locus that is responsible for gene regulation and that contains multiple transcription factor binding sites in close proximity. Given a collection of known transcription factor binding motifs, many bioinformatics methods have been proposed over the past 15 years for identifying within a genomic sequence candidate CRMs consisting of clusters of those motifs.


RESULTS
The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a P-value-based scoring scheme to identify candidate CRMs. Here, we introduce a new version of MCAST that offers improved graphical output, a dynamic background model, statistical confidence estimates based on false discovery rate estimation and, most significantly, the ability to predict CRMs while taking into account epigenomic data such as DNase I sensitivity or histone modification data. We demonstrate the validity of MCAST's statistical confidence estimates and the utility of epigenomic priors in identifying CRMs.

Here, we perform a large-scale empirical analysis of journals from every field in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database. We find that only 30 of the 2,184 journals have citation distributions that are inconsistent with a discrete lognormal distribution at the rejection threshold that controls the false discovery rate at 0.05. We find that large, multidisciplinary journals are over-represented in this set of 30 journals, leading us to conclude that, within a discipline, citation distributions are lognormal. Our results strongly suggest that the discrete lognormal distribution is a globally accurate model for the distribution of â€œeventual impactâ€ of scientific papers published in single-discipline journal in a single year that is removed sufficiently from the present date.

There is increasing appreciation that drug resistance in tumor cells emerges from the orchestrated activity of multiple cellular components in complex signaling networks. We have utilized an integrated model of glioblastoma resistance to O 6 -alkylating agents (including Temozolomide and BCNU) and genomics tools to globally explore molecular factors, cellular pathways, and functional interaction networks perturbed during the selection and evolution of drug resistance in glioblastoma cells. We have identified a transcriptomic signature of 329 genes that predicts a common in vitro and in vivo resistance phenotype to these agents (false discovery rate: 0.005), a proportion of which is recurrently imprinted by gene dosage changes in the resistant glioblastoma genome. This signature was highly enriched for genes with functions in cell death, compromise, and survival. Modularity was a predominant organizational principle of the resistance signature, with functions being carried out by groups of interacting molecules in overlapping networks. Our results highlight a key role of a cytoplasmic signaling cascade that activates nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) in response to these agents. Our data indicate the alteration of various members of the NF-ÎºB canonical pathway. Within this pathway, we have identified the tumor necrosis factor Î±-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene as a new factor significantly associated with glioblastoma cell resistance. expression of the corresponding zinc finger protein A20 closely mirrored the expression of the TNFAIP3 transcript, and was immediately related to NF-ÎºB activation status (nuclear translocation and DNA-binding) in the resistant phenotype. Translation of these findings into the clinic showed that a prediction model based on our cell model-derived resistance signature enabled us to sub-classify an independent validation cohort of 31 glioblastoma patients into distinct outcome groups ( p = 0.037). We have also revealed TNFAIP3 as part of an optimized four-gene predictor (TNFAIP3, CD44, FBXO32, SDC1) significantly associated with patient survival in glioblastoma multiforme ( p = 0.022). A Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis of the individual genes in this predictor revealed TNFAIP3 to be significantly associated with outcome when considered as individual continuous variable ( p = 0.028). Our results offer strong evidence for TNFAIP3 as a key regulator of the cytoplasmic signaling to activate NF-ÎºB in the emergence of resistance of glioblastoma cells to O 6 -alkylating chemotherapy. Our observations raise the hope for TNFAIP3 as an amenable target to modulate NF-ÎºB-mediated resistance in these cells, with the ultimate goal of increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients harboring these challenging malignancies.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Markus Bredel"", ids = ""47608636""); list(name = ""Claudia Bredel"", ids = ""5975135""); list(name = ""Dejan Juric"", ids = ""3342243""); list(name = ""George Duran"", ids = ""153139169""); list(name = ""Ron X.

2d2ab9b4ab5d8f2a4abd1209d3bd636ac5fee359,Variation at 2 q 35 ( PNKD and TMBIM 1 ) influences colorectal cancer risk and identifies a pleiotropic effect with inflammatory bowel disease,"To identify new risk loci for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a meta-analysis of seven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with independent replication, totalling 13 656 CRC cases and 21 667 controls of European ancestry. The combined analysis identified a new risk association for CRC at 2q35 marked by rs992157 (P1â„43.15 10 , odds ratio1â„41.10, 95% confidence interval1â„41.06â€“1.13), which is intronic to PNKD (paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia) and TMBIM1 (transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1). Intriguingly this susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r1â„40.90, D0 1â„40.96) with the previously discovered GWAS SNP rs2382817 for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Following on from this observation we examined for pleiotropy, or shared genetic susceptibility, between CRC and the 200 established IBD risk loci, identifying an additional 11 significant associations (false discovery rate [FDR])<0.05). Our findings provide further insight into the biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC, and identify risk factors that may influence the development of both CRC and IBD.",2016,,"list(name = ""Giulia Orlando"", ids = ""3661056""); list(name = ""Philip J.

119a5021621fde60da78fbfb385ad08f14a0f8e3,"Searching for the causal effects of body mass index in over 300 000 participants in UK Biobank, using Mendelian randomization","Mendelian randomization (MR) has been used to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on particular traits thought to be affected by BMI. However, BMI may also be a modifiable, causal risk factor for outcomes where there is no prior reason to suggest that a causal effect exists. We performed a MR phenome-wide association study (MR-pheWAS) to search for the causal effects of BMI in UK Biobank (n = 334 968), using the PHESANT open-source phenome scan tool. A subset of identified associations were followed up with a formal two-stage instrumental variable analysis in UK Biobank, to estimate the causal effect of BMI on these phenotypes. Of the 22 922 tests performed, our MR-pheWAS identified 587 associations below a stringent P value threshold corresponding to a 5% estimated false discovery rate. These included many previously identified causal effects, for instance, an adverse effect of higher BMI on risk of diabetes and hypertension. We also identified several novel effects, including protective effects of higher BMI on a set of psychosocial traits, identified initially in our preliminary MR-pheWAS in circa 115,000 UK Biobank participants and replicated in a different subset of circa 223,000 UK Biobank participants.

8e8f7e926d7652f70d584d62953809886a4d989b,Optimal False Discovery Control of Minimax Estimator,"In the analysis of high dimensional regression models, there are two important objectives: statistical estimation and variable selection. In literature, most works focus on either optimal estimation, e.g., minimax $L_2$ error, or optimal selection behavior, e.g., minimax Hamming loss. However in this study, we investigate the subtle interplay between the estimation accuracy and selection behavior. Our result shows that an estimator's $L_2$ error rate critically depends on its performance of type I error control. Essentially, the minimax convergence rate of false discovery rate over all rate-minimax estimators is a polynomial of the true sparsity ratio. This result helps us to characterize the false positive control of rate-optimal estimators under different sparsity regimes. More specifically, under near-linear sparsity, the number of yielded false positives always explodes to infinity under worst scenario, but the false discovery rate still converges to 0; under linear sparsity, even the false discovery rate doesn't asymptotically converge to 0. On the other side, in order to asymptotically eliminate all false discoveries, the estimator must be sub-optimal in terms of its convergence rate. This work attempts to offer rigorous analysis on the incompatibility phenomenon between selection consistency and rate-minimaxity observed in the high dimensional regression literature.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Qifan Song"", ids = ""3441080""); list(name = ""Guang Cheng"", ids = ""39947978"")",2c7e731f249a25a6bc2a73db8aaabbe2b09a51d5,1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 0c738fdfa27450e6f35b963335db02f20f4bf687; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 4406c54f40e0f73db2180704d454951649df32f2; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b8e37c1f4d5a1338f3d04aa9e2fb9551b0b05234; 91da74f48a1525beddbedd6177f76ebf8ef12c39; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 77e09a3eb091c4dcdba07881e18ebdb05bc4cbc4; 35407d9652fd78e4f783c2559f30bd7dd66051cd; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; f6ce2c3102440b9869025456b11cfbc9a46c7e82; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 838541412b68548eb98bf05f00293208d4d512c0; ac2ebdb7fc572b75f4f8a8afb6abd104bb9a233b; 5f0387363e3c722407308c076d5324bf6b7b00f7; d4ff7059aead6b8771f2259bed1c9232d95d28dc; 37f41ef7707f4b091de3e12b19f48e60cb015a50; 6cac4e2eec0cb3acd2fd65be1d6da9e9d503e550; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; a9cb6aa7a474e09583eb00dac8a09587b1d79a64; 668557ea6b31cd30f3d20dd808303c2686375e7b; 003e586edfa3101af83abb21c694f89aef007b7a; 7afba326d08f7b94f484a4955fe6989f86c49a18; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; 98487aeef391543597a798ee45c4a8ddd58b71b1; 7c423b6c1f47db27f0fc85cf46439cfccf985cca; fa9e0b65ef3b171e5e40c44c0bb4b29fac4af496; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 6ba008f337dbb426882fe4a86acba9aaf1dfacb9; 50bdb364b5fa74e30422023738bbbd1e16bdab52; 91f758bb644d1d1f93d75c33265582d27eccd33e; 36ccd9dc1a51e419e85ccb88f9760fb4bf34722f; 3186926f7ce65608a93c756e5453c6ee2e1ace64,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

This study was conducted to investigate the inherent metabolic patterns during lactation using the overall biofluid metabolomics and the metabolic differences from non-lactation periods, as determined using partial tissue-metabolomics. We analyzed the metabolomic profiles of four biofluids (rumen fluid, serum, milk and urine) and their relationships in six mid-lactation Holstein cows and compared their mammary gland (MG) metabolomic profiles with those of six non-lactating cows by using gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry.ResultsIn total, 33 metabolites were shared among the four biofluids, and 274 metabolites were identified in the MG tissues. The sub-clusters of the hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the rumen fluid and serum metabolomics profiles were grouped together and highly correlated but were separate from those for milk. Urine had the most different profile compared to the other three biofluids. Creatine was identified as the most different metabolite among the four biofluids (VIPâ€‰=â€‰1.537). Five metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), glycerolipid metabolism, and aspartate metabolism, showed the most functional enrichment among the four biofluids (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05, fold enrichment >2). Clear discriminations were observed in the MG metabolomics profiles between the lactating and non-lactating cows, with 54 metabolites having a significantly higher abundance (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, VIPâ€‰>â€‰1) in the lactation group. Lactobionic acid, citric acid, orotic acid and oxamide were extracted by the S-plot as potential biomarkers of the metabolic difference between lactation and non-lactation. The TCA cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glutamate metabolism and glycine metabolism were determined to be pathways that were significantly impacted (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01, impact value >0.1) in the lactation group. Among them, the TCA cycle was the most up-regulated pathway (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), with 7 of the 10 related metabolites increased in the MG tissues of the lactating cows.ConclusionsThe overall biofluid and MG tissue metabolic mechanisms in the lactating cows were interpreted in this study. Our findings are the first to provide an integrated insight and a better understanding of the metabolic mechanism of lactation, which is beneficial for developing regulated strategies to improve the metabolic status of lactating dairy cows.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hui-Zeng Sun"", ids = ""66725472""); list(name = ""Kai Shi"", ids = ""145795303""); list(name = ""Xue-hui Wu"", ids = ""4518228""); list(name = ""Mingyuan Xue"", ids = ""31811416""); list(name = ""Zi-hai Wei"", ids = ""122835764""); list(name = ""Jianxin Liu"", ids = ""144848204""); list(name = ""Hongyun Liu"", ids = ""32741189"")",837091fc9d7e35f527490ea7aab28463f0dc2e58; caccf19b0e0d39df748e1c2c26af1ee73bc1a9fe; ed0d2776750929d3631563a7751cda389f35f52a; efb1cf0b5b651661ca8b49943d6995a724e253d8; 3b36607ec8df4dc1f658a031805a3ea62d031678,b98fa782452226f1aff1f8b1893533712ebd5f77; 43995b4357c68c83615ef6b3f84225d1beebd4a7; d5b13872f91ed7c26eb99b364a2b30e2feae5948; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; 1c434182012a7277e6bd35d6fe6e40f0375fbd76; 5fbfc97318b62580ae6d4183d6ab39239994711a; 62452955d5057a76fa34b24af5d12ec3169dfc98; 74d39e35683da34a85fa2977aa7a4f12bb799e97; 0436717c0e747c0eb82878173e4042adeb0e8763; ad495df42c6c6de6563cda4db053cf64dea0dc28; 411caa9a0b535764b4bb151b2f6927df3fbcd0cf; f8426d92b0294f523033c8268399a05167bf7a6b; 7a776b2f1d679bf6be8f9c73c26787da1056fb5e; 618c9175c288e1ab6e8c33e54e105c0a06e7f131; 880b026fe94f4cf4e24be85ba3f86638484e5a86; 047f969f9d2b55b72b29ae2255ad9a4e8f5170c8; 14f39799811b1795e8c4462e1cfde9205a847003; fb2ff835d49a7461f95dc6777d85924401d6e135; a54a133562ca25a8955711f9292c2eedbeefb6c6; 652d2f2c8abfb2861b7cfdfdb6baff09fc5203a4; c2e667539feff76a1b7c2e863bef9762a482cdf6; ccc7f2ac3b54aede11f3939932a1ef3d71d702cb; 36ea92cb58c6771b1e23be3c4d9688ee063bac9f; c1b7a02b859d8fe1d0fd333dde3a5cd3de0bd828; de71d88496fd4fc78de2ada8b8716c5be93cce1a; 7d4deed07950724efbb1bcacda7d68ebc2b2d4e0; 139868478c4557d8bd1b03cd5f76aa85817c8e0d; 1220d9f7d5f75464ee6751c01c2c6937fc3803a7; 375071a040703907a30680943bba5fd1b8c83238; aec74017b3adf6e700e29aef9b23e1ed02c5b059; bfbc6c53bda6630fa921fb5f06f84ce196260e30; fd6b71a41658086f901e88765be24924e5ecdf80; a4c999d0ace0cdba6d508469199deeee6f233190; 869229b2771ab13c140d0c85fa40b4b0d196c0bb; d18577ab286bd6db25099eabc9da0dacbe33d24f; 4ce8f45327adeed96cde7cef90f8bbe28b55b9de; e01d7695606bd5a11206b00ab67979023ad2104c; 048ddbbfb1223effe9cb37bb398f39d6cc3c8e47; 5409a7d3fd4d5b7874f9a4c2ea157a1a24d92d1f; 9151ce12bf3963317480c5072c7118d415e4f95b; ffda6951cf1f1c9cad400abef65bf34c6130e9bb; e3c280595f15b31699a34641efbef20cbf3dd21a; c885fab95aade5dd0a66be6fee2844d144515796; 5eb7ad4f270363903fd825a6722b65d58ab59e0a; 671b830b81074bbe850e20026e4351c00b07ff1d; 5150ba9d7ab52818d572de54a6de41d8bfe00038; fe6ddeef527c1da99b97a26efe386e9ed4ba9f32; 9b4137df7a0cebb3c45b43c56dde554771c7d4b9; 6ff5927a55c653e5bbb1fdd1cfb40386c99417dc; 102eda88ab1bd63ae855ae3d6c6c6af04dc3e939; 85875b7e986f6463b9183a6810f2422bb97f3922; 261a88fd468ed00efa3b0899129944485de79255; 8f54ae621a98d3e786b3a0de8751e9dfb901b87d; 2358632a98b71b0ee88b6b4b33e0aecddf0571d8; 3e2f63e2572f8ba03be3b29553efb43c973f8fae; 2c320ac8bd1a69e43134b88b8d8e5e9a33e9baee; 5d5ccb558af47413f8e1334e781c4de529153e72; c5a56af441aee83afc4fc3a43d1ae81d720f983c; a6ce61a3972ba47efa30214533ad0905aaee88f4; ab6be9526ebe7b4c1354d2657c50883d3e5eb24f,BMC Genomics,18,
cd2fdd7dd7665ff5ed15ac99d5789e4b74da08ed,Integrative Genomics in Combination with RNA Interference Identifies Prognostic and Functionally Relevant Gene Targets for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), metastasis to lymph nodes is associated with a 50% reduction in 5-year survival. To identify a metastatic gene set based on DNA copy number abnormalities (CNAs) of differentially expressed genes, we compared DNA and RNA of OSCC cells laser-microdissected from non-metastatic primary tumors (n = 17) with those from lymph node metastases (n = 20), using Affymetrix 250K Nsp single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, respectively. With a false discovery rate (FDR)<5%, 1988 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between primary and metastatic OSCC. Of these, 114 were found to have a significant correlation between DNA copy number and gene expression (FDR<0.01). Among these 114 correlated transcripts, the corresponding genomic regions of each of 95 transcripts had CNAs differences between primary and metastatic OSCC (FDR<0.01). Using an independent dataset of 133 patients, multivariable analysis showed that the OSCC-specific and overall mortality hazards ratio (HR) for patients carrying the 95-transcript signature were 4.75 (95% CI: 2.03-11.11) and 3.45 (95% CI: 1.84-6.50), respectively. To determine the degree by which these genes impact cell survival, we compared the growth of five OSCC cell lines before and after knockdown of over-amplified transcripts via a high-throughput siRNA-mediated screen. The expression-knockdown of 18 of the 26 genes tested showed a growth suppression â‰¥ 30% in at least one cell line (P<0.01). In particular, cell lines derived from late-stage OSCC were more sensitive to the knockdown of G3BP1 than cell lines derived from early-stage OSCC, and the growth suppression was likely caused by increase in apoptosis. Further investigation is warranted to examine the biological role of these genes in OSCC progression and their therapeutic potentials.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chang Xu"", ids = ""144962257""); list(name = ""Pei Wang"", ids = ""144049067""); list(name = ""Yan Liu"", ids = ""1700568""); list(name = ""Yuzheng Zhang"", ids = ""40048569""); list(name = ""Wenhong Fan"", ids = ""2806031""); list(name = ""Melissa P.

Defining genes that are involved in tumor driven angiogenesis may yield therapeutically important targets for cancer therapy. We have developed and optimized a rapid 25 minute immunohistochemical staining method using CD31 antibody (Pecam1) specific to endothelial cells in vessels on sections from frozen human breast cancer (n=3) and normal breast (n=3), followed by laser capture microdisection (LCM) of vessels. Good quality RNA was extracted amplified, and fluorescently labeled cDNA was synthesized and hybridized onto Affymetrix U-133 Plus 2.0 array. Using this methodology, we were able to elucidate the genetic profile of tumor associated vessels from invasive breast cancer and compare it with vessels in normal breast tissue. This technique has the advantage over other methods in analyzing genetic profile of tissue as it analyses the genetic profile of isolated cell population and eliminates genes expressed by surrounding tissue, allowing for the detection of low expression of genes that were not detected in whole tumor arrays.

The microRNA (miRNA), 19 to 22 nucleotides noncoding RNA, are one of the molecular cues that could play a role in posttranscriptional regulation of genes involved in follicular development. Here we aimed to understand the availability and abundance of miRNA in bovine granulosa cells (GC) derived from subordinate (SF) and leading or dominant (DF) follicles during bovine follicular recruitment and dominance at Day 3 and 7 of the oestrus cycle, respectively. For this, Simmental heifers (nâ€‰=â€‰15) were oestrus synchronized and slaughtered at 3 (nâ€‰=â€‰6) and 7 (nâ€‰=â€‰7) days after the onset of the oestrous. The SF and DF were retrieved from each animal to obtain the corresponding GC, which were subjected to miRNA-enriched total RNA isolation using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The integrity and quality of RNA was determined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., DE, USA), respectively. The RNA was then subjected to miRNA deep sequencing using the Illumina HISEqn 2000. Raw sequence data were further processed and analysed using miRDeep2 software package. Quantification of differentially expressed (DE) miRNA was done using R software and DESEqn 2 package. MiRNA with log2 fold change difference â‰¥1, P-value â‰¤0.05, and false discovery rate â‰¤1 were considered to be significant. Data analysis revealed that 291 and 311 miRNA were detected in GC of SF and 312 and 314 were detected in GC of DF at Days 3 and 7, respectively. A total of 17 miRNA were DE in GC from SF compared with the DF at Day 3, of which 15 miRNA were enriched and the remaining 2 were down-regulated in SF. Similarly, at Day 7 a total of 136 miRNA was altered with 51 miRNA showed to be enriched, whereas 85 others remained low in SF compared with the DF. Nine miRNA (bta-miR-21â€“3p, bta-miR-221, bta-miR-708, bta-miR-214, bta-miR-335, bta-miR-155, bta-miR-199a-5p, bta-miR-21â€“5p and bta-miR-222) were commonly differentially expressed both at Day 3 and 7 between SF and DF. Interestingly, all of the commonly DE miRNA, except bta-miR-335, were enriched in GC of SF at both days. Gene ontological analysis indicated that majority of the DE miRNA were found to be involved in regulation of programmed cell death, cell projection morphogenesis, regulation of cell proliferation, and macromolecule biosynthesis. Therefore, the temporal abundance of mature miRNAs in GC during bovine follicular development may suggest their potential role in regulation of follicular development in general and follicular recruitment and dominance in particular.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Dessie Salilew-Wondim"", ids = ""1390134427""); list(name = ""Ijaz Ahmad"", ids = ""5350189""); list(name = ""Samuel Gebremedhn"", ids = ""4159712""); list(name = ""Sudeep Sahadevan"", ids = ""5975752""); list(name = ""Michael Hoelker"", ids = ""3751413""); list(name = ""Franca Rings"", ids = ""4476433""); list(name = ""J.

It provides a suite of statistical tools for selection and prioritization of the amino acid sites that are responsible for the functional divergence of a gene family. The synergistic efforts of DIVERGE and other methods have convincingly demonstrated that the pattern of rate change at a particular amino acid site may contain insightful information about the underlying functional divergence following gene duplication. These predicted sites may be used as candidates for further experiments. We are now releasing an updated version of DIVERGE with the following improvements: 1) a feasible approach to examining functional divergence in nearly complete sequences by including deletions and insertions (indels); 2) the calculation of the false discovery rate of functionally diverging sites; 3) estimation of the effective number of functional divergence-related sites that is reliable and insensitive to cutoffs; 4) a statistical test for asymmetric functional divergence; and 5) a new method to infer functional divergence specific to a given duplicate cluster. In addition, we have made efforts to improve software design and produce a well-written software manual for the general user.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xun Gu"", ids = ""39195369""); list(name = ""Yangyun Zou"", ids = ""8298996"");

f55a2d4c4fcc4f8915b43f944410dcd78cc94035,Copy Number Variation Detection Using Total Variation,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies offer new opportunities for precise and accurate identification of genomic aberrations, including copy number variations (CNVs). For high-throughput NGS data, using depth of coverage has become a major approach to identify CNVs, especially for whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Due to the high level of noise and biases of read-count data and complexity of the WES data, existing CNV detection tools identify many false CNV segments. Besides, NGS generates a huge amount of data, requiring to use effective and efficient methods. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation algorithm based on the total variation approach to detect CNVs more precisely and efficiently using WES data. The proposed method also filters out outlier read-counts and identifies significant change points to reduce false positives. We used real and simulated data to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare its performance with those of other commonly used CNV detection methods. Using simulated and real data, we show that the proposed method outperforms the existing CNV detection methods in terms of accuracy and false discovery rate and has a faster runtime compared to the circular binary segmentation method.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fatima Zare"", ids = ""14658933""); list(name = ""Sheida Nabavi"", ids = ""145834073"")",,0ec80c4c9b26edadd9b0e1e51f5202df5cb458ae; 3ba96f0cc9d122a549e06e71457d79e75b027474; d069e7ad957dc6a5c7854b322f7e42dc644d370c; ba7497f765efd3b46a43711508265167470994ec; 3937df87f1990cdaa9999db8302ba05f871cab01; eb1ef4750e082faa409e00e68b4308faa9201246; 3c794d760da32d0a36694a1eee4be3d30fe3a93f; 6f66dc05ce39165507583a21bd9d4a7ba35ce647; 72e7a8c74b3c71bb4cfb63a9e92c3113a13155bb; 65220a315251eceacd9022e124c8c7b84b58e4e9; b68e4acd77942ae16247724575eaf9b4117af40d; a2327c729ab1843fc8e9b28662fcb75a4d52c67d; 818f580d15305d78c314036c7c19cc99a79bc3d3; 5cfa393e32dbc0003c903ee98cb424022cd581f4; 8c0cf32901dee35ba6d44b38255183abbcdae501; d557542be2aed65dc8b9ca7ef44d0a6c05c44c6b; 874cc3d7f38afed3543f961b49511aead2c91457; 0c2b9b25359c0e1ffe639b96836516dd7ced87ea; 39395439291d6762e6c04b825763eae04b8ec02e; 63c0530c84e9241e877ab69d49677512fa9789f7; 88ff7c158c4fa072cbf0093ece0ac8a66069f9db; 3a0480863b35829301a9f886b54760644db496c9; 00ae21c9a84bc24f35448acddcf4fd30539604a0; 5198e79054f2d8116fce346248c32ff7a15a189b; edab44f8ce464972c43a2260a6ab0e2c548b428c; 104ec4a0e33770e37c2bd35f3037b4f090d288e9; 69ea10d1bc224ccc8c1e8c6324d3a65cf8e8ffd7; b6de563c03eedf95d7e880a2aeb5688936ea1d26; de7a097a8093650b0c6fa938fc54019b6dd20061; 3fab9720ddf259eab21465276f5e301c4b774c32; 6448cf98c51a949b596ff6ac00835d16086796db; c445c811c5c7022aef4dd8b5fa009c107191d441; ad81652a6c7d211b47565191103fd3e9cf9cf0e4,"Proceedings of the 10th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics",,

Standard nutritional and compositional parameters for maize grain and forage (e.g., proximates, fiber, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, anti-nutrients, secondary metabolites) from DP202216 maize were compared to grain and forage from non-modified near-isoline maize (control). Three amino acids (glycine, methionine, and serine) and two vitamins (vitamin B1 and vitamin B3) were statistically different between DP202216 and control maize grain but were not statistically different when adjusted using the false discovery rate method. These analyte values also fell within the ranges of natural variation of non-modified commercial maize varieties supporting that statistical differences were not biologically relevant. The composition of grain and forage from DP202216 maize is comparable to grain and forage from non-modified maize with a history of safe use.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer A.

We proposed a novel solution to the problem of correcting Binary Relevance ensembles. The main step of the correction procedure is to compute label-wise competence and cross-competence measures, which model error pattern of the underlying classifier. The method was evaluated using 20 benchmark datasets. In order to assess the efficiency of the introduced model, it was compared against 3 state-of-the-art approaches. The comparison was performed using 4 different evaluation measures. Although the introduced algorithm, as its base algorithm â€“ Binary Relevance, is insensitive to dependencies between labels, the conducted experimental study reveals that the proposed algorithm outperform other methods in terms of Hamming-loss and False Discovery Rate.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pawel Trajdos"", ids = ""1901879""); list(name = ""Marek Kurzynski"", ids = ""3262354"")",8b1bdd0840575ed9d8b878c3571814514b1eccc1; 5a1862f65f012dad43083490fa147f2b1d877c9c; 0269e4cfab337512f6809467a0d38c5d7b12d96e; c42a39f6e866eef5cac133d3e5ad0d35308023af,,,,69-76

Based on 2â€part regression models, the prevalences of kicking (OR, 1.70; P = .023), pushing (OR, 3.22; P < .001), and swiping (OR, 1.78; P = .018) increased with years of age, but the prevalence of hair pulling decreased with age (OR, 0.55; P = .020). The prevalences of hitting and throwing increased initially, then plateaued at age 18â€20 months, and then decreased (quadratic aOR, 0.13 and 0.16; P < .001 and .010, respectively). The frequencies of hitting (R2 = .05; P < .001) and throwing (R2 = .03; P = .030) increased, and the frequencies of hair pulling (R2 = .07; P < .001) and scratching (R2 = .02; P = .042) decreased with age (P values adjusted for false discovery rate). Conclusions Physically aggressive behavior in the 6â€ to 24â€month age range appears to be nearly ubiquitous. Most, but not all, forms of physical aggression increase with age. These results can guide pediatricians as they educate and counsel parents about their child's behavior in the first 2 years of life.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael F Lorber"", ids = ""3152694""); list(name = ""Tamara Del Vecchio"", ids = ""4744467""); list(name = ""Amy M.

cd0e1e1b0977a8ea56459335ac99e58337ab03af,RNA-seq-based evaluation of bicolor tepal pigmentation in Asiatic hybrid lilies (Lilium spp.),"BackgroundColor patterns in angiosperm flowers are produced by spatially and temporally restricted deposition of pigments. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for restricted pigment deposition is a topic of broad interest. Some dicots species develop bicolor petals, which are often caused by the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes. An Asiatic hybrid lily (Lilium spp.) cultivar Lollypop develops bicolor tepals with pigmented tips and white bases. Here, we analyzed the global transcription of pigmented and non-pigmented tepal parts from Lollypop, to determine the main transcriptomic differences.ResultsDe novo assembly of RNA-seq data yielded 49,239 contigs (39,426 unigenes), which included a variety of novel transcripts, such as those involved in flavonoid-glycosylation and sequestration and in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Additionally, 1258 of the unigenes exhibited significantly differential expression between the tepal parts (false discovery rates <0.05). The pigmented tepal parts accumulated more anthocyanins, and unigenes annotated as anthocyanin biosynthesis genes (e.g., CHS, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, and anthocyanidin synthase) were expressed 7â€“30-fold higher than those in non-pigmented parts. These results indicate that the transcriptional regulation of biosynthesis genes is more likely involved in the development of bicolor lily tepals rather than the PTGS of CHS genes. In addition, the expression level of a unigene homologous to LhMYB12, which often regulates full-tepal anthocyanin pigmentation in lilies, was >2-fold higher in the pigmented parts. Thus, LhMYB12 should be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the biosynthesis genes in bicolor tepals. Other factors that potentially suppress or enhance the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, including a WD40 gene, were identified, and their involvement in bicolor development is discussed.ConclusionsOur results indicate that the bicolor trait of Lollypop tepals is caused by the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and that the transcription profile of LhMYB12 provides a clue for elucidating the mechanisms of the trait. The tepal transcriptome constructed in this study will accelerate investigations of the genetic controls of anthocyanin color patterns, including the bicolor patterns, of Lilium spp.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kazuma Suzuki"", ids = ""50355004""); list(name = ""Tomohiro Suzuki"", ids = ""2555149""); list(name = ""Takashi Nakatsuka"", ids = ""3814229""); list(name = ""Hideo Dohra"", ids = ""5236137""); list(name = ""Masumi Yamagishi"", ids = ""6811152""); list(name = ""Kohei Matsuyama"", ids = ""5228090""); list(name = ""Hideyuki Matsuura"", ids = ""143959891"")",7da2e332b1943a4665a4752f771d09bfb4a9f3f3; 0153d9761f47ce867bbc0c2967f51dca3baf7d67; 350fd6a35f095a397969e1f19a9de27fcbd6bd03; aee739ea5a3d09b6e211e4e7a1e9bde90083c2c8; a366fa272c358a79eb4171b7d5beccadf47f977b; c33f99918c92cf0d10db571b5186f8e5b24d06ac; d70690699a962de355ab74d6fb07a55f9d8119f1; 35e2e23fa5bf20fa1f5c5ce8c93890cfb903ff22; a1ea8fcca39b9da71d028e9e556d8500b21d9707; 7258bf64a0206ef5fc3b49381741443fa993472f; 6c01e22f87d7c9f2a6690870f1b9ac848472c90e; d632a5e842d15b2d9d03a768be24e6356227cc81; 40d8f660ce2b067e43a52d3163991857e845cd9e; 88d7aef5c725878340ebed6940d6ba5d4aaa013b,d66cf568e7e938c739b182807d5ce5347c51a355; 034e75f071d324224afe53476d7bb6eedb336a76; 783aa63d829b25fbb1539499f1cbac16651b5011; 47a9fa70414da116ac10fb199385a42bb687a9de; 32937677bc519e60f9131d334ccd905cd2212139; 4fb4fb69863797d14d7239f92989f524893ea575; c1777a58c91099ac7bd3c0da44dc7c9ea6103209; ac57f6bb4cc43e9dd521d049bc148f2a293df660; 6277f99f6632de49cd9ad453a945d890e9f39677; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 83321f33e310aa38f68d31c1c66585dcf5afe990; 21582914d5fec44fb512182659d414ecc54f8006; ee22c4e6f319ce649488d9cdb11eb1ba54a5f250; 62e81b6744344ad45c656d9c14d55ee7f1ea735d; 90986184495311b8132b77832da7bc987b90f734; 1248291734434070098cd3c36015036b80e025b5; cd92ba7f4b6fcfa0681894b6143d88048ba46ba4; e3e6443dc4edae3cabf47891b430456b0c40028a; 604982690a701e2de3bf7c2b478825b83842f54e; 016385ba01c48a8c682ea73aae12b527bf52d1ae; d50458c350897b517ac409a568b941e13f071e76; 86c6606b46cf907a12feedaf070af6d77fa5c086; 7e046b59b962f85e93659dbbec1a12852d2e13ef; b44fb54bb752ddf0a72a04d405e047c9930dca21; 80378dc039abc0543b98524b5a448c919737bc52; f4354024eaddc9af0caeae977ac4e37483d8b07d; d97717ebdad18d94b6c1cede7f761dff94309b7a; 84bc346ca34192b0c0e4a9d296388a54bfc2d82f; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; f3cc83b7aee0eefde4991f2ae60b99cd2eb4e88c; fca80a39ad059ef8f0c6d0e803e08c94a4316239; 5aa880d238fa804e5e82a08d0d2549a7dc650194; 7f2eb2a4b5bb5b828c2ee9c5e64d1341ad5885ec; a2d781ebf99dc419e21a83390b37a96da4c43167; 13648e96c8d16d759183db1e0309c4bf41715886; 0a3730f39245cb5f1caffe63941ed14d5784149f; 35993ef876f8a398b3e857638d349a33961f3cd1; 3a835da5b264971210bcf0c136ac19127eee360a; 3aa2b7c90df1e399547b8af831051343d8fd95bc; f744315642da2d75789a4ebe0c65e4d9292a488f; 6993d6ccaa5f243188af5d0eb624cf7d8fa91661; dd37145116c26450f8807188d87026a6383a2406; 820699377e02da251ba340f206ca6f342012a4e4; af14f8ab4ea51c99b75376d7ca7659f55068f458; 929c2d55c3e8dbd97304903921b9fb5af648c798; 44d47dd282963c828bd41e4581eb673c3166c8c3; a41dff6fd98e8195fb97f3f91958a13d06f6248c; cbfe5e10833aff5aee8566bfc396a126076ad103; 1c0f36c91b2efb02c85305fee90e6e203e8727f9; 17d01d94092942d99625e2df0614a03977f64960; 376d534563c47b0f8206482801f1cc871ff19ee1; 7c6a0fcbd43a0278d9223f636bd6fd2a849f6ec3; 4dc67cd40a5518378e37b09cf665b892c786e7e8; 4f7da5513c1155405df5f759de23020fac8eff18; 3164c74bfc9a0183c3f4069ee10d88dbd8f99018; 20d1e3da8d733a3e2024ee62d0fb01559b90a689; e198fd441c962f4bc44b62e1cf69d680d260bfb3; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; 81e0802d68a2567564ed4039240612276a56af41; 5331599c6aaf9ecd23d6848ab42df9161a03a4b1; e591df5d9720fbbb444a24f2e1e87108e1e5a9d9; 5bc840af7715030548528db162d09deba28e6c3e; fc8f34db5377aff11da91c21332d318526a61a41; b2994142ed8b40057dad8d45127bc6886b167ae8; d6a5a1e8f56260608d2f7651a2f6aac6a041b57a; cdb56a9c7bd81f74dc9f06c8f8e3d00fd5f1b094; 9f61d97ac1b20edc020d7e910a826e564218f49f; 800229871f935d457042450ded693c6fdcf5a50f; e2cb361357936bcd1828cab1d08f0ae7c41f7ee7; 6ce883bbd111affd079d26c6d5496a71f30b260c; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 136c651b01194b62479d8d1ccd9137421a059dde; 4084672d01396f0c6d22322301ccf897816bcdc6; aba429514dd57bb214b69ddee5add028b6cfd49f; a1e2eb9cc31e9d1c552d11f2d2952e2397e86d69; 70e5de16d5f1498571378150657a2b66942a4d8e; 14b56c96706a36f0df42fa1a15fda5f845e79d24; 27ea8047bcd724e8217bd0c8c32e31a0d5a2c7df; 9419689585f06d6a87619f1cbf841cbeac49b92e; d4124f6064052d3d343d9c10cc0bfb97c397bdf1,BMC Genomics,17,
50991a200dcc80c7f4173f97976d0551c50cb69f,Microarray analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells highlights new anti-inflammatory and vasodilating properties of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid,"High intake of Ï‰-3 fatty acids has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects and cardiovascular protection, but the underlying molecular basis remains incompletely defined. Using a DNA microarray technology we investigated the early gene expression profile of human vascular endothelium conditioned by DHA under pro-inflammatory conditions.

Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with 50 Î¼mol/L DHA for 48 hours and then stimulated with 5 ng/mL IL-1Î² for 3 hours. Total RNA was extracted, and qualitatively/quantitatively analyzed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and an Agilent Bioanalyzer before RNA labeling and purification. Gene expression profile was performed with an Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray covering 41 000 unique genes and transcripts. Slides were scanned with the Agilent's scanner and images processed using Agilent Feature Extraction software. The raw data were further processed with the GeneSpringÂ® 10 software and differentially expressed RNA identified using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate with a P-value <0.05. Functional and network analyses were identified by the Ingenuity Pathways version 8.0 Analysis.

Results: Fixing a significance threshold at 1.5 fold of change (FC), IL-1 stimulation significantly changed the expression of 2031 genes, down-regulating 997 and up-regulating 1034. Treatment with DHA before IL-1 stimulation significantly affected the expression of 48 IL-1-deregulated genes. The application of the Ingenuity pathway analysis software allowed us to pinpoint immunological-, inflammatory- and metabolic-related pathways as the most affected. In particular, we identified new DHA regulated genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation, cardiovascular system development and function, and cancer. These included the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L)1, apoliprotein (Apol)3, phosphodiesterase (PDE)5A, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î²2.

Conclusions: Endothelial exposure to DHA before IL-1 stimulation modulates several IL-1 deregulated genes. The unbiased identification of novel genes regulated by DHA treatment improves our understanding of mechanisms by which fish oils may prevent or attenuate human chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marika Massaro"", ids = ""8558741""); list(name = ""Egeria Scoditti"", ids = ""4350631""); list(name = ""Ma Carluccio"", ids = ""52093526""); list(name = ""Rosanna Martinelli"", ids = ""49687338""); list(name = ""T Buonuomo"", ids = ""84346331""); list(name = ""Valentina Gatta"", ids = ""49879901""); list(name = ""Carlo Storelli"", ids = ""6226325""); list(name = ""Raffaele De Caterina"", ids = ""77360640"")",,,European Heart Journal,34,4157

A new test statistic is constructed for testing the global hypothesis that multiple covariance matrices are equal, and its limiting null distribution is established. Correction methods are introduced to improve the accuracy of the test for finite samples. It is shown that the proposed tests are powerful against sparse alternatives and enjoy certain optimality properties. We then propose a multiple testing procedure for simultaneously testing the equality of the entries of the covariance matrices across multiple populations. The proposed method is shown to control the false discovery rate. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed tests maintain the desired error rates under the null and have good power under the alternative. The methods are also applied to a Novartis multi-tissue analysis. In addition, testing and support recovery of submatrices of multiple covariance matrices are studied.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yin Xia"", ids = ""49289914"")",,,TEST,26,782-801

However, molecular genetic characterization of AR-EBLPD remains largely unknown. We studied expression profiles of 5 AR-EBLPD and 8 EB-negative DLBCL samples using the Agilent 44K human oligonucleotide microarray. Total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tumor samples. Each microarray slide was converted into datasets using the Agilent Micro Array Scanner and Feature extractions. Data was standardized with Z-scores. Differences in mRNA expression levels between two sample groups were calculated using a two-sided t -test. A total of 1973 probes showed a p -value less than 0.05 with less than a 25% false discovery rate (FDR). These probes included 1688 genes. The number of probes showing high expression in AR-EBLPD and EB-negative DLBCL was 804 (693 genes) and 1169 (995 genes), respectively. First, we selected the top 300 differentially expressed genes. Genes highly expressed in AR-EBLPD included IL6, TNFAIP3, HOPX, and SLAMF1. IL6 is known as a gene encoding a cytokine which functions in inflammation and the maturation of B lymphocytes, and TNFAIP3 is known as a negative regulatory gene of the NF-kB pathway. HOPX and SLAMF1 are reported as genes related to lymphocyte function or the immune system (Schwartzberg et al. Nature immunology 2009, Hawiger et al. Nature immunology 2011). For better characterization, we next performed Gene Ontology Analysis using the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit and found that categories of external stimulus and inflammatory responses were enriched in AR-EBLPD. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-signaling analyses showed that pathways of the NOD-like receptor ( p -value =1.30e-06), JAK-STAT ( p -value =9.01e-06), and Toll-like receptor ( p -value =0.0002) were characteristic of AR-EBLPD. These results implied that inflammation would be prominent in AR-EBLPD cases. For validation, we next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using all the database of KEGG pathways (186 gene sets). Dominant gene sets in AR-EBLPD included the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction [Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) =2.66, p -value p -value p -value p -value et al. Nature 2011) and 30 gene sets in the GSEA database, and found that the gene sets of the NF-kB pathway were enriched in AR-EBLPD (Figure 1). Our results suggested that the inflammatory and immune-related genes were enriched in AR-EBLPD and that activation of the genes may be associated with NF-kB activation.

e9df44e44153d673107e1219707b2166b67030f9,Plasma metabolites mediate the effect of HbA1c on incident cardiovascular disease,"BACKGROUND
We aim to discover whether HbA1c affects incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) through regulating endogenous metabolites.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Totally, 2019 plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Logistic regression and linear regression were used to screen metabolites which were associated with both CVD and HbA1c. The VanderWeele's mediation approach was performed to assess the direct effect and indirect effect (IE) in the counterfactual model. Forty-eight metabolites showed an association with both HbA1c and CVD risk. Forty-four of the 48 metabolites worked as mediators mediated in HbA1c's effect on CVD (odds ratio [OR]IE from 0.997 to 6.098, false discovery rate q < 0.05, mediated proportion from 0.4% to 85.4%). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that different metabolic pathway showed significant IE (butanoate metabolism ORIE = 1.058, mediated proportion = 16.0%; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism ORIE = 1.082, mediated proportion = 21.8%; TCA (citric acid) cycle metabolism ORIE = 1.048, mediated proportion = 13.8%; phenylalanine metabolism ORIE = 1.067, mediated proportion = 18.4%; glycerophospholipid metabolism ORIE = 3.007, mediated proportion = 82.2%; all the P <â€‰.01).

cc847d09e2c1e09aa39fd6a67b4ef292550adc87,Next Generation Proteomic Pipeline for Chromosome-Based Proteomic Research Using NeXtProt and GENCODE Databases.,"Human Proteome Project aims to map all human proteins including missing proteins as well as proteoforms with post translational modifications, alternative splicing variants (ASVs), and single amino acid variants (SAAVs). neXtProt and Ensemble databases are usually used to provide curated information on human coding genes. However, to find these proteoforms, we (Chr #11 team) first introduce a streamlined pipeline using customized and concatenated neXtProt and GENCODE originated from Ensemble, with controlled false discovery rate (FDR). Because of large sized databases used in this pipeline, we found more stringent FDR filtering (0.1% at the peptide level and 1% at the protein level) to claim novel findings, such as GENCODE ASVs and missing proteins, from human hippocampus data set (MSV000081385) and ProteomeXchange (PXD007166). Using our next generation proteomic pipeline (nextPP) with neXtProt and GENCODE databases, two missing proteins such as activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC, Chr 8) and glutamate receptor ionotropic, kainite 5 (GRIK5, Chr 19) were additionally identified with two or more unique peptides from human brain tissues. Additionally, by applying the pipeline to human brain related data sets such as cortex (PXD000067 and PXD000561), spinal cord, and fetal brain (PXD000561), seven GENCODE ASVs such as ACTN4-012 (Chr.19), DPYSL2-005 (Chr.8), MPRIP-003 (Chr.17), NCAM1-013 (Chr.11), EPB41L1-017 (Chr.20), AGAP1-004 (Chr.2), and CPNE5-005 (Chr.6) were identified from two or more data sets. The identified peptides of GENCODE ASVs were mapped onto novel exon insertions, alternative translations at 5'-untranslated region, or novel protein coding sequence. Applying the pipeline to male reproductive organ related data sets, 52 GENCODE ASVs were identified from two testis (PXD000561 and PXD002179) and a spermatozoa (PXD003947) data sets. Four out of 52 GENCODE ASVs such as RAB11FIP5-008 (Chr. 2), RP13-347D8.7-001 (Chr. X), PRDX4-002 (Chr.

1cc55c8a984e02383d89e6e88ab753e929011395,Association Study of Nonsynonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND
Genome-wide association studies using several hundred thousand anonymous markers present limited statistical power. Alternatively, association studies restricted to common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) have the advantage of strongly reducing the multiple testing problem, while increasing the probability of testing functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).


METHODS
We performed a case-control association study of common nsSNPs in Galician (northwest Spain) samples using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human 20k cSNP Kit, followed by a replication study of the more promising results. After quality control procedures, the discovery sample consisted of 5100 nsSNPs at minor allele frequency >5% analyzed in 476 schizophrenia patients and 447 control subjects. The replication sample consisted of 4069 cases and 15,128 control subjects of European origin. We also performed multilocus analysis, using aggregated scores of nsSNPs at liberal significance thresholds and cross-validation procedures.


RESULTS
The 5 independent nsSNPs with false discovery rate q â‰¤ .25, as well as 13 additional nsSNPs at p < .01 and located in functional candidate genes, were genotyped in the replication samples. One SNP, rs13107325, located at the metal ions transporter gene SLC39A8, reached significance in the combined sample after Bonferroni correction (trend test, p = 2.7 Ã— 10(-6), allelic odds ratio = 1.32). This SNP presents minor allele frequency of 5% to 10% in many European populations but is rare outside Europe. We also confirmed the polygenic component of susceptibility.


CONCLUSIONS
Taking into account that another metal ions transporter gene, SLC39A3, is associated to bipolar disorder, our findings reveal a role for brain metal homeostasis in psychosis.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Noa Carrera"", ids = ""48200797""); list(name = ""Manuel Arrojo"", ids = ""6381203""); list(name = ""Julio Sanjuan"", ids = ""144180455""); list(name = ""RamÃ³n Ramos-RÃ­os"", ids = ""1398640669""); list(name = ""Javier Costas"", ids = ""144991863"")",d84c4d1c802c2bef8c6643a5f10351f68ddc9366; f8a0cd0f19c44d66107f5eda509be294e4914169; 05e3a8c54f6457e93949167a4054706b08042e8e; e7d29e4b8a5138e6e0d3e5080ce9eb22ba6fafdd; 9f6726fea2e73ee301c9c9694a580804b45b9e79; 62dfbe21e128e70aee80d8c80036f343ade7152c; 67acf25bf266b12a4b59b5b3cc477b0c6e38f284; a0697d2fc5900311c817f729aefd20a04b78d2c9; d7cc3c3e8c4d0ffab7bde1d989e6d44700de1342; b5ba9cf65447d46342fa7b1f50c68d7a7c47a508; 146d40cd6b5d5673183848a48d58c80001098f4b; fd11ade06981a0adffe6482e259804d826c0d191; 67db4087f5ed3b5bd95fc18c064677795ae4d271; 6a9b6a8978a0877cf5d4f1487322160538a1ea65; f6497e993af226a49efd4157c2ed0c365e63e8cd; 8d12885202a601b2eba5b55fd5ba62c9568188d0; 80c30c1c35aec40c45a0152d002b1ef19e399edc; e8001f16de872001d91faf24fb250e980b1d9d58; e5951391ebe54c4a9921524d0f3c989f507c7ba1; ef45102f44171307878338848e9e14174f173428; 4f5c5bd73222fe21c8ad35bfcbd0d21b2e6fe834; 25dddfbb1cecc4ab208acb6365867671f9289fce; 254580d5966f2229521cbacd347d11f499b1145b; a1174180d4ce1866eff6f4293eaf8e1bf5a38949; 97b352e2fa2a53f81f859e75c7c803ced77fe153; d2722b353a5aac245c3bd6e9935517b8cc1c4a01; c42ee97e5623fbe8b4938db7610f1a51fb7b899f; 369359adcbcc2350a3a3dea2ae4969f18e317a07; 1af18a4ba2132df096030986aa2c7376d94db5da; e77678bf9c94b4c78a23327db2c1a22c53ec8592; 449abd70b26046cfade081bb6157c25ecd34fc61; 97295b675118635f45ce92ffdebc2771b22a52a0; 8944dacbd8a322af909589cbdd8305943f6b6d2b; ac9144512eaad4a2214c06f5c37300a3b6c8d18e; 98b3b8f78144436a6c0a66753f7fd19d791bcb2e; b6d7b9b9a70bb4f47d66f0928c2dbb451daaf432; 6422ca5bc3f8f62d4baa83172e2cffb4c8d8efa2; 2a940f9ccc91da1e08a382a6e4546118992df65b; 608e2fe3500c547018dc53aadbb5550c16f27889; 24447d516d84f76cd9b839940c0e31ef9485f7d6; 76e51b8d3864d5f09f9358b5052faff8a5e8872c; 9cbcf0926f3f48ccd8683b7fb786ea574384e0df; 936e02fce7c2e87cc8da94e01ab04574b3c13081,af17c4d43033be816d0be0b8f434b3d6d58463ab; 2f458aabfceb5f6f9000bf38a696ee39d3819f2d; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 26ba17452d40f4601f27c8cd119dca57bed7f2dd; 1e625daaf71c47fcd22a579bbadc225f65547fd9; a91d30758a534500980e6ae64d0a20006d0a22fc; f14f75a56b1891100d84ed02537e0de92c1dea1c; 618e8468f9d4ccfa87d1169fda99e72cb2f7641d; 7d25385b1877ad6d13ec6442cc7c003c406f95c3; b74124dc225f203d70fcf43927975713d0cfce93; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 91cb79b7245ad59c42013636041d3502904c088c; 8d3835063996e768c34ed5136811229c9153ac38; 336ae9d5787613507661db096233b8e1df83f6ae; 6ee4fbbbd223cd0eec636780f797268c0e633461; d289047b4507c83650c2e88728062e5fa5172e0f; 1a82a092b3b7f84dd1d85b5dbba79d7c41768008; b16913705a9b5a9b667f941d80905860c4c0bd24; d76bde423b71f1cb900b988311bd2d71b700d506; 71d932d588fb6a8174b5962cd7049f1d3ee37c8d; 0474d71b41dab21106cd6a1b9004437df1593751; 3fc7ac4ede3b595fc3741c6b57ee547bfd202cad; 03a79bd071af8fc9c649612f2632fc11c5d4e2ac; 98217b3c462c9b68b0d3d8eafca1e3d9e9a6db83; a8980ddb3b83d6a139543463c9c1b18d307a9338; 7c9c96531aae7afc6bdfbcb1a6e03b20d779a17d; 29ed5e8460606832889fbefd1b732b73993d2475; 7fa7790e2fb9aa7d34b69a808259221773014fba; 14f9a6f34bc881b1fcd5d44b80c4d01bda9ba48f; 97d7041ca3378045c475cf1069ec3e74130f18e9; aa44f3c6b61bec6957ba40d73ea394c2adbb799a; 6d45b4a90a2aed8145972f525bcb2abc126a3fd5; 270c9c8075ca0dee2c73d8235cf27afbb4b2beae; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 7eef4051b4d69262252b44e9d7573192da33a2b9; fa02f9123abacd5ba13d41e937d99c077da8d3f6; ddc32b7a193ffcaebeb63d3c6341052b4f2343e6; 74f6d554025596d033a2a022f17a2f1bcd620efe; f2c6bf5fc9edea07dbf1cbbd02c75ec745de1515; 2ed67585dce5eb65dcdd93ddf267c07ef7bbca13; dec1ba636fe2c59afc45de95a2a8a305c5786924; eea5da435f6db0d49048a770f46aaf4d9ba01fde,Biological Psychiatry,71,169-177

Maternal blood and placental samples collected from participants in the Peruvian Abruptio Placentae Epidemiology study were genotyped using Illumina's Cardio-Metabochip platform. We examined 118,782 genome-wide SNPs and 333 SNPs in 32 candidate genes from mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in placental DNA from 280 PA cases and 244 controls. We assessed maternal-placental interactions in the candidate gene SNPS and two imprinted regions (IGF2/H19 and C19MC). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios. We examined the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk using weighted genetic risk scores (WGRS) with repeated ten-fold cross-validations. A multinomial model was used to investigate maternal-placental genetic interactions. In placental genome-wide and candidate gene analyses, no SNP was significant after false discovery rate correction. The top genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits were rs544201, rs1484464 (CTNNA2), rs4149570 (TNFRSF1A) and rs13055470 (ZNRF3) (p-values: 1.11e-05 to 3.54e-05). The top 200 SNPs of the GWAS overrepresented genes involved in cell cycle, growth and proliferation. The top candidate gene hits were rs16949118 (COX10) and rs7609948 (THRB) (p-values: 6.00e-03 and 8.19e-03). Participants in the highest quartile of WGRS based on cross-validations using SNPs selected from the GWAS and candidate gene analyses had a 8.40-fold (95% CI: 5.8-12.56) and a 4.46-fold (95% CI: 2.94-6.72) higher odds of PA compared to participants in the lowest quartile. We found maternal-placental genetic interactions on PA risk for two SNPs in PPARG (chr3:12313450 and chr3:12412978) and maternal imprinting effects for multiple SNPs in the C19MC and IGF2/H19 regions. Variations in the placental genome and interactions between maternal-placental genetic variations may contribute to PA risk. Larger studies may help advance our understanding of PA pathogenesis.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marie Louise Denis"", ids = ""145273772""); list(name = ""Daniel A.

37286161978693f9ce27c8b4e03b15d1667a7cc1,Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data in Workflows for the Discovery of Biomarkets in Breast Cancer,"Abstract : The major achievement for the last year was the development of the workflow for the LC-MS/MS proteomic experiment and testing it on the real data. This included setting up an appropriate mathematical/statistical scheme of random-effect models. The overall significance of multiple hypothesis testing was controlled by the false discovery rate approach. To improve the statistical power and clinical interpretation of the results, the protein identifications were mapped to high quality publicly available data sources, and differential quantification was rolled up to the gene level. The technique similar to the gene set enrichment analysis in microarrays is used to find statistically significant differences between the protein families. To achieve a dataset with minimal false identifications, functional annotations from the GeneOntology and the HUPO project were added as well as known plasma concentration from the literature. To understand the biological relevance of the differentially expressed proteins we used several functional annotation tools. We plan to complement the mass-spectrometry data with metabolomic analysis, and will provide additional data from protein microarrays.e",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Vladimir Ivanovich Fokin"", ids = ""145126037"")",,,,,
ba542e0ef57cde92fe83b54a65b930f52f115887,[Association between both maternal and fetal angiotensinogen gene single nucleotide polymorphism and preeclampsia/eclampsia].,"Objective: To explore the association between preeclampsia/eclampsia and maternal and fetal angiotensinogen SNPs. Methods: From January 2008 to October 2015, a case-parents/mother-control designed study was conducted among 347 preeclampsia/eclampsia cases and 700 controls to collect related information on their demographic characteristics and to detect the related angiotensinogen SNPs' genotypes. Both log-linear and unconditional logistic regression methods were employed to investigate the genetic effects of maternal/fetal angiotensinogen SNPs on preeclampsia/eclampsia. Multivariate binary unconditional logistic regression model and covariance were used to analyze the relationship between BMI before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy and overweight and obesity in preschool children. Results: Both fetal angiotensinogen rs3789679 GA and AA genotype were associated with the reduced risks of preeclampsia/eclampsia, with ORs as 0.73 (95%CI: 0.55-0.96) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.39-0.98), respectively. For fetal angiotensinogen rs2493132, individuals that carrying the TT genotype, presented a positive association with the risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia, with OR as 1.60 (95%CI: 1.08-2.37). However, these associations were not statistically significant after the correction of the false discovery rate. It was observed that fetal rs3789679 could reduce the risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR=0.73, 95%CI: 0.55-0.96) under the dominant model (GA+AA/GG) while fetal rs2493132 increased the risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR=1.66, 95%CI: 1.13-2.44) under the recessive model (TT/CC+CT). Maternal rs5051 presented an association with preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR=1.33, 95%CI: 1.01-1.76) under the dominant model (TC+CC/TT). Conclusions: Results from the dominant model showed that both fetal rs3789679 GA and AA genotype reduced the risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia and maternal rs5051 TC while CC genotype increased the risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia. Fetal rs2493132 TT genotype seemed to be associated with the risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia under the recessive model.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shaoling Yu"", ids = ""12493086""); list(name = ""Weijun Peng"", ids = ""40547862""); list(name = ""Hai-hua Zhang"", ids = ""7214177""); list(name = ""X.

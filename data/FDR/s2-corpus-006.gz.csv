5b19664e1bf24af06f488c7eb548ac63d612389e,Similar age-related decline in cortical activity over frontotemporal regions in schizophrenia: a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"OBJECTIVES
Although recent studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls did not differ in the speed of age-related decline in cortical thickness and performances on cognitive tests, hemodynamic changes assessed by functional neuroimaging remain unclear. This study investigated age effects on regional brain cortical activity to determine whether there is similar age-related decline in cortical activity as those observed in cortical thickness and cognitive test performance.


METHOD
A total of 109 patients with schizophrenia (age range: 16-59 y) and 106 healthy controls (age range: 16-59 y) underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) while performing a verbal fluency test (VFT). Group comparison of cortical activity was examined using 2-tailed t tests, adopting the false discovery rate method. The relationship between age and cortical activity was investigated using correlational and multiple regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounding variables. A 2-way ANOVA was conducted to investigate differences in the age effects between diagnostic groups.


RESULTS
The patient group exhibited significantly decreased cortical activity in several regions of the frontotemporal cortices. However, slopes of age-dependent decreases in cortical activity were similar between patients and healthy individuals at the bilateral frontotemporal regions.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study showed no significant between-group differences in the age-related decline in cortical activity, as measured by NIRS, over the frontotemporal regions during a VFT. The results of our study may indicate a decrease in cortical activity in a relatively limited period around illness onset rather than continuously progressing over the course of the illness.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Po-Han Chou"", ids = ""145431855""); list(name = ""Shinsuke Koike"", ids = ""38245898""); list(name = ""Yukika Nishimura"", ids = ""7137901""); list(name = ""Yoshihiro Satomura"", ids = ""3182163""); list(name = ""Akihide Kinoshita"", ids = ""2065479""); list(name = ""Ryu Takizawa"", ids = ""2458276""); list(name = ""Kiyoto Kasai"", ids = ""2099925"")",23f7edb0422053733bb143435854ab1b196be286; 2ff7bdf9457b608de074d1e3623785a95178f1e8; 2c9df026ac253bc332234c25f1ea2f5feb0b8fa9; 5951e2dd4e770e8ee66d82b56522098809ac923e; 029355a8ba7480703f352227c82fbc08008cb333; 341fb99220809b607969bedd28d8b086af336ea2; 2f4ae9712e8f79c4c011109d38e6434e5c60825c; dff727272227be2afbdee67b00e309fa3fb65977; cef13b300f71ee6563d07f0b11b54b8ff9c91fce; 4e72117988d6d02d6153d12b323b46722fa40b31; 60db33a69388cf99ab87d3dfc3a6376a0b9ae165,e111b18998c524833affdb957d49ad01f447051b; 15359f815e1360bad009b3474feb7ddc4d06c903; 849e3de363844a874cdccbcdb757b7e176b2a836; 506541731a2e19a62fb8d9b6a9afadf8bbd9ff78; e609cdbac646e4e40aa91209cb1e9327af5c5219; b18f8d7b173c0b90aa85e4930ab5e11b192c4849; 39a6298e140cf678b925246a43401653cc5bef84; 732ab035397abc9bb1b9fe3e9dbfaa04e3264571; 762ac7520be7aa81b1e5e5c0fee7dc6f29b9abb5; 16b2fcc3f0d07db19ac923866009d461746e37df; e64cc93552ea9fb0e7496380549be5ca62808bc3; 3bbe9a13ec4e5dcbff73e54935aa89bcaa934d6a; 2e80153abe83ea5970dd35031b7bb749b9016f4b; 16666a0596d923dfc9f24710a8a0a391cb3e2f05; c42e914a16f163ba25d6333804454ef61195431a; 20e9be359d3da8caf8a7dea53a8f61aabf1edc6a; e583510f10e7a3a4567a7e5750179aad77db3d57; adc42c6bddea0ffa490c3aca72d1ddd97530e793; e009873ea9e2f64e9a47c956325700607697bb66; ed80389cdb135fae838d0edda2f6e72498235711; 8becdcf73520298b781dabfccfcc18fac7101dc1; aaf85a065546be3d68377dc6d1316c2fce0a5642; aa2b8fcd5c4bce0d5cfb6efefafdf19e099ea5e9; 78cc3e08400d218a404ab60e92c0b00f81fcfa53; 62155041627358da53d8bbba2addaf16df32e6b7; dc87e35cf4ecb0709eeb5b33dae91d03171e21bd; 52ebd0222356b66a389c36ae8c3e871cac651c40; 812a6bed32049697af98adb91d082b19cfbebdf8; 87551f205400ecb1e2a6a10ec7cea1cc5f2a1321; 5af02f05fb63e308ff84bcd692dd19709c14c508; f332608394b0ada30438daeca7e056971550db12; 557b23b49b2d76159be22b8d7f7e4795e4eb3fbd; 467afbdbefc4c8ee7294d37e41ea36e9d2d969ca; c25b6aaa34719e9e12655431bc4416c6039ebf1f; 68fc6698ab3bfcaccf56de9c336680f371c362b4; 12023537b77871c8d33f7e989f3e1642cc78b456; 6f7069b153f629e3ae4693c1bc55f5acf4cde359; fdbb531663b76675919b93975b1c97b9d43c69b6; 30a2ff1494aa2f65c6b0c26459d973422b69ef73; 5b0092e7b77f6838382de74238ef89c96efcc522; c276c5ee38680ce0283a4835ea8e764af6192b65; 80fce64f3d4d8ad3d5cde0a73eaf5f227bb1af5c; 76bb2f3987d247fbd0d507c74291ff8af51e2899; e531b9821e39c1e1aa2df1641774ba31af736913; 386f36966c3365d4530f3e8d6957edb94f6ffd50; fc1c3faed0700b1c0e8bddfd5a1c5f6a6a0fd616; dac0f34be4751a3f30083c8ef0143bc283af324a; b3a61dcc74b686e31a929cb43548b22d7a76432d; 54977c1a4ad8efcebe27b7fd279b808936bd859f; bdc05d375279260f8785c7ec2d67a162f1a929d2; 8a99e36ea9d060c442cdf12f6e4c56372b56b10d; 36285acfc34eeda182e8513ac9fd1514a7d52b2e; 032b3a3d83aa55a2cc1ee2fa86f27eb76118cd7a; 736bf49b370b4aefce43f7141847efd2dd483ebf; b1f6b6d7fd81422f3ac70d8908bda5fa92b8e64d; 6edfed1220b6cc2a2c1a31db05fc4fed00057feb; 1843a7a03fcaf06cd44044b2315fb00d830f3bd3; 359d81bee1001645dda3b62839a0a127bd11c3a0; d5c5932dea6818355102c7340be0f99b4afcbe44; b2ef275784059f820bfee1f021b96bac79e0d4cb; 9b6f3d80a6d80cab62d183e44a84901be750a61e; 79b43f58c0654b9e52dcec68c75de0156d775425; f620c97eedf0ffd87661634f1e63d24625f0c65b; c2174bf267b89b261453b4529ab7888759bd3c13; 141703e203fbd6301e85985a55af8a7181896ced; b8e16f93763dafe2760fc26239edf6a175a53d6c; f912a44f1f74a8150d2acb50f724930b37b5a2e2; b0db99b3fb1448cc7f56d6dd32d8c7358c1142bb; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; 66f31c5781e8d77139bde2d30cde4b4a8c925ae6; 03f7a462a23c4a65065302d64abc68ec0ba9c490; 213456123c626ca98c7242b6d716eb24d564c2dd; f47922d1cda30677bf26e71c6713fde501acd4c8; 0da011d7220348e9f0ea0082624799aa1172d718; f50b1ffa2cf83a261adc40cc17d9f7544b46ebf2; 43b4dc018b2c132a5b6d502b31c85e7cbde8f875; 75c2f465d59739dbc06b70fd34dc3c1b2336103e; 66692cc50a878d5ed544cfb54903ec7acbef0fe9; 7ffd34266b64f98fa0583b18d0c92c979c9287dd; 451c4b5968e0bf96c9d11e011ede052308254851; de4b506dc1d5b42cf275a44960dd8c492ae52d89; 1fdda693b4ee926a084958b642a44812b2e00648,Schizophrenia bulletin,41 1,"

ec96e2fec7b9fccebc2be7b9aa445f6bf3fbb275,"Genetic and Proteomic Analysis of Functionally Distinct Human Hematopoietic Stem Cells from Bone Marrow, Mobilized Peripheral Blood, and Cord Blood","The bone marrow (BM) repopulating potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is directly related to the cell cycle status of these cells. In general, only mitotically quiescent HSCs retain the ability to engraft and sustain long-term multilineage reconstitution in conditioned recipients. In a series of studies, our laboratory previously examined the effect of cell cycle status on the engraftment potential of human HSC from three different hematopoietic tissues. Only CD34+ cells in G0 phase of cell cycle (G0CD34+) from adult human BM or mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) engrafted successfully in conditioned NOD/SCID mice whereas those in G1 phase of cell cycle (G1CD34+) failed to do so. In contrast, both G0CD34+ and G1CD34+ cells from cord blood (CB) engrafted effectively. In the present study, we used the distinct in vivo behavior of these groups of adult and neonatal cells as the basis for genotypic and proteomic analyses in which it was possible to align multiple profiles of functional and non-functional HSC and therefore derive a genetic and protein fingerprint that may be associated with Engraftment potential of human stem cells. Human CD34+ cells from BM, MPB, and CB were sorted into G0 and G1 phases of cell cycle and the cell cycle status of each isolated fraction was further confirmed by the expression or lack thereof of Ki67 by qRT-PCR. Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays were used for genotyping (three independent samples from each tissue for a total of 18 groups) and a Linear Mixed Effect Model was used to identify differentially expressed genes, with at least a two-fold increase in expression and false discovery rate",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Brahmananda Reddy Chitteti"", ids = ""48901924""); list(name = ""Bradley Poteat"", ids = ""4033502""); list(name = ""Mu Wang"", ids = ""94136175""); list(name = ""Yunlong Liu"", ids = ""47909932""); list(name = ""Edward F Srour"", ids = ""3625120"")",2fbdc3249914ef8a1c239807cb2a652fe911eb28,,Blood,112,1324-1324
9639c3015a5a75cf1efa5058ea43e54ec9c429b4,SNPs and Other Features as They Predispose to Complex Disease: Genome-Wide Predictive Analysis of a Quantitative Phenotype for Hypertension,"Though recently they have fallen into some disrepute, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been formulated and applied to understanding essential hypertension. The principal goal here is to use data gathered in a GWAS to gauge the extent to which SNPs and their interactions with other features can be combined to predict mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in 3138 pre-menopausal and naturally post-menopausal white women. More precisely, we quantify the extent to which data as described permit prediction of MAP beyond what is possible from traditional risk factors such as blood cholesterol levels and glucose levels. Of course, these traditional risk factors are genetic, though typically not explicitly so. In all, there were 44 such risk factors/clinical variables measured and 377,790 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped. Data for women we studied are from first visit measurements taken as part of the Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We begin by assessing non-SNP features in their abilities to predict MAP, employing a novel regression technique with two stages, first the discovery of main effects and next discovery of their interactions. The long list of SNPs genotyped is reduced to a manageable list for combining with non-SNP features in prediction. We adapted Efron's local false discovery rate to produce this reduced list. Selected non-SNP and SNP features and their interactions are used to predict MAP using adaptive linear regression. We quantify quality of prediction by an estimated coefficient of determination (R(2)). We compare the accuracy of prediction with and without information from SNPs.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joong-Ho Won"", ids = ""2816315""); list(name = ""Georg B.

0378d9886b184810cb05012f78d5a96c9615af49,Mass spectrometry protein expression profiles in colorectal cancer tissue associated with clinico-pathological features of disease,"BackgroundStudies of several tumour types have shown that expression profiling of cellular protein extracted from surgical tissue specimens by direct mass spectrometry analysis can accurately discriminate tumour from normal tissue and in some cases can sub-classify disease. We have evaluated the potential value of this approach to classify various clinico-pathological features in colorectal cancer by employing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).MethodsProtein extracts from 31 tumour and 33 normal mucosa specimens were purified, subjected to MALDI-Tof MS and then analysed using the 'GenePattern' suite of computational tools (Broad Institute, MIT, USA). Comparative Gene Marker Selection with either a t-test or a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) test statistic was used to identify and rank differentially expressed marker peaks. The k-nearest neighbours algorithm was used to build classification models either using separate training and test datasets or else by using an iterative, 'leave-one-out' cross-validation method.Results73 protein peaks in the mass range 1800-16000Da were differentially expressed in tumour verses adjacent normal mucosa tissue (P â‰¤ 0.01, false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis classified most tumour and normal mucosa into distinct cluster groups. Supervised prediction correctly classified the tumour/normal mucosa status of specimens in an independent test spectra dataset with 100% sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval: 67.9-99.2%). Supervised prediction using 'leave-one-out' cross validation algorithms for tumour spectra correctly classified 10/13 poorly differentiated and 16/18 well/moderately differentiated tumours (P = < 0.001; receiver-operator characteristics - ROC - error, 0.171); disease recurrence was correctly predicted in 5/6 cases and disease-free survival (median follow-up time, 25 months) was correctly predicted in 22/23 cases (P = < 0.001; ROC error, 0.105). A similar analysis of normal mucosa spectra correctly predicted 11/14 patients with, and 15/19 patients without lymph node involvement (P = 0.001; ROC error, 0.212).ConclusionsProtein expression profiling of surgically resected CRC tissue extracts by MALDI-TOF MS has potential value in studies aimed at improved molecular classification of this disease.

74d8e016fedf0d57caeb4656a43c884c944eaef2,Improved detection of genetic loci in estimated glomerular filtration rate and type 2 diabetes using a pleiotropic cFDR method,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been shown to have the potential of explaining more of the â€œmissing heritabilityâ€ of complex human phenotypes by improving statistical approaches. Here, we applied a genetic-pleiotropy-informed conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) to capture additional polygenic effects associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (creatinine) (eGFRcrea) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The cFDR analysis improves the identification of pleiotropic variants by incorporating potentially shared genetic mechanisms between two related traits. The Qâ€“Q and fold-enrichment plots were used to assess the enrichment of SNPs associated with eGFRcrea or T2D, and Manhattan plots were used for showing chromosomal locations of the significant loci detected. By applying the cFDR method, we newly identified 74 loci for eGFRcrea and 3 loci for T2D with the cFDR criterion of 0.05 compared with previous related GWAS studies. Four shared SNPs were detected to be associated with both eGFRcrea and T2D at the significant conjunction cFDR level of 0.05, and these shared SNPs had not been reported in previous studies. In addition, we used DAVID analysis to perform functional analysis of the shared SNPsâ€™ annotated genes and found their potential hidden associations with eGFRcrea and T2D. In this study, the cFDR method shows the feasibility to detect more genetic variants underlying the heritability of eGFRcrea and T2D, and the overlapping SNPs identified could be regarded as candidate loci that provide a thread of genetic mechanisms between eGFRcrea and T2D in future research.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hui-Min Liu"", ids = ""2024955""); list(name = ""Jing-Yang He"", ids = ""50774762""); list(name = ""Qiang Zhang"", ids = ""143721012""); list(name = ""Wan-Qiang Lv"", ids = ""23620348""); list(name = ""Xin Xia"", ids = ""144558661""); list(name = ""Chang-qing Sun"", ids = ""49321932""); list(name = ""Weidong Zhang"", ids = ""117636057""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424"")",9e8e22491ac67b4024aa25282566422ce20d3d36; 8521e07c667b78ea626c87999183a298c0ff7d1c,65ae34915b43cd7c0030c74a7c2def7b321bed89; 09e6d84f8173c13a96820c4d08e418c73b85be1f; e4415522a8c81eedcce4ec68397d64779c45d7d9; 4b53127fc6c5ed861594395b5e77d36951c2bc05; ba1f227d7f2cb6c6d722ab31cc2e80ab569ef586; facd7266c1b646779029c132d93af446c4a91f18; bf9ce5690d537e332f42f25f41a359b4c9bff659; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; 2da4775c6cdbf4a6bcd8a63410cddd43e8ff098d; 33ec49060dad5e183f720101588f45edb393d2ca; c1c230d99f3002ffcb5ca2d9682d8d820c5d76eb; 630a0e8f7ff0ddf9cf605d4a8560ca26a07e4e88; 0169ad24cb5c5f29d60a42765d2ba7273888f37b; 0c0e363c5d174c70134d52d2b1a94b62c7b0b7d8; 53f268db95d09a8cc5858e790dc8c2804f0f7efc; 19a6d2943e31743ff788ef1663f0839b2d55d614; 50437d072ff46811be3860c5d680ba28b02db603; 7078ef40d034d011fc283cde523397d2dc045bfa; 8df0a5859a4e319a218de007ae92c47a3a0a21c8; 2922184f13d4e8dd406825dc71b10599ba689d45; 1bde5ebbdaa78b1feb9f26a70f4f26a34499e2e1; 864e2e7f3db087299d0c1da7b6f9223eaa11292d; a77031db15da51114bae7f1b972ca255994f0677; a81ed8fde68c8cc240bd03b21252c0fb2cdc724b; 9a0f381e166f28851d8613526da0e8a4a3e5e1f0; 3a94fddb6474f849d89d753e348860e5526e6567; 7071ef0d018556c1b046303fa230e9fe64cbe571; 91c71c82356b101042502e2f80efe6a454d7ff09; 9541d26c5afd06a01cfcfa3e1473634645f70c2a; 357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55; f65c0321e2b6ec48155e6a434205cf335d6c0cde; 11a3ac464b7cc5afe48172efe12ce4346dbf452d; 973501e1fc13985b6f5628b3949f210616e15042; 0cb7796010d4c67556a9dbb29e2a8faf3a283252; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 1eb5d89cec11609da7ea0cc5f045cbb8a4c92160; 24a5c503371d7476983ca76945f16b3f2915ea1e; 44962d9b1a7ff35199b2a0e3858a8f37a8a1f377; 469a953e79b1873a91c2ee339b5d43cc3a9b5054; 6587c656c7337bd502afd3d738d34f4baa01379a; 1018674a361826d31f3e69f2941160e5ac4ff517; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; f50d9c60e3aa0632a6b6c26417f3c34def88dc64; 4f7f22aa77f7b918fbdef193bff39eb9aaa04730; 16522ac5199e09714a444e179e3882ab55d2dcc2; c7fe2d5fe125c1db9c1fbbaea7d86dfa0b49835b; cb32c7fa04351c10bfe634459849c63d6b43f203; 721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef,Molecular Genetics and Genomics,293,225-235
403a81f6a79af03d1bf7ca6161ff4de94627ea9e,Selection Adjusted Confidence Intervals With More Power to Determine the Sign,"In many current large-scale problems, confidence intervals (CIs) are constructed only for the parameters that are large, as indicated by their estimators, ignoring the smaller parameters. Such selective inference poses a problem to the usual marginal CIs that no longer offer the right level of coverage, not even on the average over the selected parameters. We address this problem by developing three methods to construct short and valid CIs for the location parameter of a symmetric unimodal distribution, while conditioning on its estimator being larger than some constant threshold. In two of these methods, the CI is further required to offer early sign determination, that is, to avoid including parameters of both signs for relatively small values of the estimator. One of the two, the Conditional Quasi-Conventional CI, offers a good balance between length and sign determination while protecting from the effect of selection. The CI is not symmetric, extending more toward 0 than away from it, nor is it of constant shape. However, when the estimator is far away from the threshold, the proposed CI tends to the usual marginal one. In spite of its complexity, it is specified by closed form expressions, up to a small set of constants that are each the solution of a single variable equation. When multiple testing procedures are used to control the false discovery rate or other error rates, the resulting threshold for selecting may be data dependent. We show that conditioning the above CIs on the data-dependent threshold still offers false coverage-statement rate (FCR) for many widely used testing procedures. For these reasons, the conditional CIs for the parameters selected this way are an attractive alternative to the available general FCR adjusted intervals. We demonstrate the use of the method in the analysis of some 14,000 correlations between hormone change and brain activity change in response to the subjects being exposed to stressful movie clips.

898d2f09372faef7fbe7ac383415e74e97d8b9a5,Large Scale Maximum Average Power Multiple Inference on Time-Course Count Data with Application to RNA-Seq Analysis.,"Experiments that longitudinally collect RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data can provide transformative insights in biology research by revealing dynamic patterns of genes. Such experiments create great demands for new analytic approaches to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes based on large-scale time-course count data. Existing methods, however, are sub-optimal with respect to power and may lack theoretical justification. Furthermore, most existing tests are designed to distinguish among conditions based on overall differential patterns across time, though in practice, a variety of composite hypotheses are of more scientific interest. Lastly, some current methods may fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper, we propose a new model and testing procedure to address the above issues simultaneously. Specifically, conditional on a latent Gaussian mixture with evolving means, we model the data by negative binomial distributions. Motivated by Storey (2007) and Hwang and Liu (2010), we introduce a general testing framework based on the proposed model and show that the proposed test enjoys the optimality property of maximum average power. The test allows not only identification of traditional DE genes but also testing of a variety of composite hypotheses of biological interest. We establish the identifiability of the proposed model, implement the proposed method via efficient algorithms, and demonstrate its good performance via simulation studies. The procedure reveals interesting biological insights when applied to data from an experiment that examines the effect of varying light environments on the fundamental physiology of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

d9a69b7ca4cc83ec30a01cd44ce6b99a7141f231,Abstract B37: Small nucleolar RNAs â€“ New players in breast cancer prognosis,"Introduction: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are predominantly involved in biogenesis of rRNAs and in modifications (methylation and pseudouridylation) of other RNAs such as rRNAs and tRNAs. Although snoRNAs were initially considered as housekeeping genes, recent literature indicated relative variations in their expression in tumors compared to normal tissues. snoRNAs have also been observed to play a role in cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, splicing mechanisms, and in some instances, in regulation of gene expression, suggesting that dysregulation of this class of small RNAs may contribute to tumorigenesis. snoRNAs have shown promise as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for cancers such as lung and leukemia. Elevated snoRNAs and the genes involved in their biogenesis have also been reported to be important for Breast Cancer (BC). However, their role as prognostic markers in BC has not been addressed. Objectives: (i) To identify differentially expressed (DE) snoRNAs in BC and (ii) To identify snoRNAs as prognostic markers for BC. Methods: Small RNA libraries from 104 BC cases and 11 normal breast tissues (reduction mammoplasty) were generated for next generation sequencing (NGS), and bioinformatic analysis was carried out using Partek Genomics Suite 6.6. snoRNAs were annotated using Ensembl database. RPKM normalized data was adjusted for potential batch effects and was filtered for snoRNAs with â‰¥ 10 read counts in at least 90% of the samples. snoRNAs exhibiting a fold change >2.0 and a false discovery rate Results: In the CC approach, 768 snoRNAs were profiled and 88 were retained after filtering, of which 40 were DE (31 down regulated and 9 up regulated); of these, five and four snoRNAs were significant for OS and RFS, respectively. In the CO approach, 763 snoRNAs were profiled, of which 95 were retained after filtering; of these, twelve and ten snoRNAs were significant for OS and RFS, respectively and includes the snoRNAs identified by CC approach. In both the approaches, patients belonging to high-risk group were associated with poor prognosis and the risk score was significant after adjusting for confounders. Platform concordance of the results will be assessed by qRT-PCR for representative snoRNAs. Validations of these findings in independent datasets are in progress. Summary: This is the first study to comprehensively analyse the role of snoRNAs as prognostic markers for BC using NGS. The combined risk score from the signatures was identified as potential independent prognostic factor for BC. Conclusions: Dysregulation of snoRNAs in breast tumors relative to normal were identified, indicating that these small RNAs could potentially contribute to breast tumorigenesis. As expected, CO approach identified higher numbers of markers with prognostic significance, highlighting the importance of adopting an unbiased approach in a biomarker study.

215842d3c1d08149f12e7553bd4cf67090770402,Cerebral blood flow abnormalities in patients with neurally mediated syncope,"The aim of this study is to investigate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with syncope. We compared brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of neurally mediated syncope patients with those of age/sex matched healthy volunteers. 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD) brain SPECT was performed in 35 patients (M/FÂ =Â 17/18, mean 36.6Â years) with syncope during the asymptomatic period, and in 35 healthy volunteers. For statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis, all SPECT images were spatially normalized to the standard SPECT template and then smoothed using a 14-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel. The mean duration of syncope history was 4.9Â years and the mean number of syncope episodes was 6.3. In all patients, syncope or presyncope episodes occurred during head-up tilt tests, and all were the vasodepressive type. SPM analysis of brain SPECT images showed significantly decreased rCBF in the right anterior insular cortex, left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyri, bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyri, left lingual gyrus, bilateral precuneus and bilateral posterior lobes of the cerebellum in syncope patients at a false discovery rate corrected pÂ <Â 0.05. There were no brain regions that showed increased rCBF in syncope patients. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the total number of syncopal episodes and the rCBF of the right prefrontal cortex, and between the duration of syncope history and the rCBF of the right cingulate gyrus at uncorrected pÂ <Â 0.001. Decreases of rCBF in multiple brain regions may be responsible for autonomic dysregulation and improper processing of emotional stress in neurally mediated syncope patients, and frequent syncope episodes may lead to frontal dysfuction.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eun Yeon Joo"", ids = ""1920146""); list(name = ""Seung Bong Hong"", ids = ""3018797""); list(name = ""Minjoo Lee"", ids = ""2483113""); list(name = ""Woo Suk Tae"", ids = ""5316406""); list(name = ""James S Lee"", ids = ""49685463""); list(name = ""Suk Won Han"", ids = ""3362221""); list(name = ""Ki-Hwan Ji"", ids = ""49228853""); list(name = ""Minah Suh"", ids = ""49631259"")",a1d5d78373e4cb6e5cca5734a8709c8fa6e6273b; 227900770449fe38741c3bc9a9e38d2cd87acf40; 2eeaff981dfe204bccc8f6c042d80960d7631cca; c2ff2c0db61e649ee53e6d551d37d8180e507140; 9fff285b5c07574eb18c7e18eba0d5710feaaed5; 039c9711a31ff064a5b35a98dc912814fad9f610; 18a3c00864677e0c5fcd9fe0b82e3f8fab4cf4f7,be367b56d6b5a5301f8b0d2c98ebcfcbb532aa8d; f0e9fd6a9ac88a87fa4e25198a8e4324ab02c300; d481bee2a48228981bc35d768e80c6ff68edada8; 15710b4cb73dcc2043c02fe76206f619db780fef; 0c38bf11320458d007d10bdef010dbe17cf22f32; 0fc8f803d8f4d0c1dbda08279a6078cda727060f; ee52d8c35ebdd45de5f92a0ced805198b874d373; 57fa68e846907981a0b977fa1f7fc67c4c9c8bf4; 16058eec47397ced981965a43b0fb3f3d9532fe5; 118281d4135a9a8f3dab1367985f9fb0937fd79c; c783cd0c1fbc6c1931bd01e40e62333c3381430f; 71b98696b47d14c24ffd098c21ce001427d4d669; 0fd8462d47985678d5c174373afecbc9236fd85b; 276424b1e1920eabc78a2ea92c89410d15ce31f4; e197caab023d0d40aec7d96e622dc2cbc14e6971; 3460534612a59d2d7f0a5dcc404ed21d4778c11b; 49055bc89483aa68885c2ecd2d8ada9730597918; f4da3e154549a69c61b573ccd86746cfbfab0fdf; 9d607177aeb31d3aebf53e07506a390693033919; 6bb07c2d9d399a6bd2654920540ebaeb52ee9529; c33524d8c05fbadbe85d7086d9f1386c67b49726; 6fec3a0012afc56b9f70e40ffd0b54c78fb470f5; 4acb2b3c09a2abe25fd932e6ac47b372775e63cc; 0472eca015d115d0b5d1814477891d209b97768e; b38ec0e307eee3df6b610d2521414c765df8e35e; 3df01359b32fecbec50693a6a376a605c570156c; 796f2c8904438c4d996eb0d3a4c4e15c71fb1217; e5f124c0864271967274084c07ae49b00f228f1f; 164f730df915006595b46d8ed82bb118e9afbbb5; 600ad1b86ce21ecb07cde8f0a3e4fe715cf3ae16; 3500307e134b997ba212cccdc42451f29fdbd4bf; 5e4518f82eef69d27ba0ebb0eb7a198b1e4fd446; 6fb6ae8bebaf32b491ecc3689778acb77f8af18f; fabf95041ff3debdd703c941021df8c27b8b3b69; c3e351216cf89ac5821458f4d700a03f20850682; 9603d26e90af2ab422f26dfa558d7fd153629f66; 90ff5ac33bcd483d1d89c4a050734174b16fe4eb,Journal of Neurology,258,366-372
2fd194678bed846c92b4dc6d99e5466d3bdd70eb,On a Generalized False Discovery Rate by Sanat,"The concept of k-FWER has received much attention lately as an appropriate error rate for multiple testing when one seeks to control at least k false rejections, for some fixed k â‰¥ 1. A less conservative notion, the k-FDR, has been introduced very recently by Sarkar [Ann. Statist. 34 (2006) 394â€“415], generalizing the false discovery rate of Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289â€“300]. In this article, we bring newer insight to the k-FDR considering a mixture model involving independent p-values before motivating the developments of some new procedures that control it. We prove the k-FDR control of the proposed methods under a slightly weaker condition than in the mixture model. We provide numerical evidence of the proposed methodsâ€™ superior power performance over some k-FWER and kFDR methods. Finally, we apply our methods to a real data set.",2009,,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

However, significant gaps in knowledge exist in the understanding of consequences of glucose load during pregnancy, a state of insulin resistance. Using high dimensional protein arrays, we conducted a pilot proof-of-concept and feasibility study to investigate profiles of 120 plasma proteins in pre- and post- 50-gram oral glucose challenge samples. Participants (N=10) were selected from among women enrolled in a pregnancy co- hort. Differences in plasma protein concentrations between pre- and post-glucose load challenge samples were evaluated using Student's T-test (paired) and mean fold change comparisons. Multiple testing adjusted p-values (i.e., false discovery rate q values) were computed using Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrections. Plasma haptoglobulin, epi- dermal growth factor, hemoglobin, thrombospondin-1, and S100 protein concentrations were two to five fold higher in post-glucose load compared with pre-glucose load samples (all q-values 31 years (above median), post-load S100 protein was elevated 9.92-fold above pre-load concentrations, while it was elevated 4.10-fold among women aged 101mg/dl (above median). Our study findings suggest that post-glucose load changes in plasma biomarkers represent a diverse set of cellular responses including receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) , inflammation, oxidative stress and adipogenesis, during mid-pregnancy. Future studies of lar- ger populations and longer periods of follow-up are warranted.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Daniel A.

b536228983ed784db0eb393bb50d5f97c141d46c,Comparing 3 T and 1.5 T MRI for tracking Alzheimer's disease progression with tensor-based morphometry.,"A key question in designing MRI-based clinical trials is how the main magnetic field strength of the scanner affects the power to detect disease effects. In 110 subjects scanned longitudinally at both 3.0 and 1.5 T, including 24 patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) [74.8 +/- 9.2 years, MMSE: 22.6 +/- 2.0 at baseline], 51 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [74.1 +/- 8.0 years, MMSE: 26.6 +/- 2.0], and 35 controls [75.9 +/- 4.6 years, MMSE: 29.3 +/- 0.8], we assessed whether higher-field MR imaging offers higher or lower power to detect longitudinal changes in the brain, using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to reveal the location of progressive atrophy. As expected, at both field strengths, progressive atrophy was widespread in AD and more spatially restricted in MCI. Power analysis revealed that, to detect a 25% slowing of atrophy (with 80% power), 37 AD and 108 MCI subjects would be needed at 1.5 T versus 49 AD and 166 MCI subjects at 3 T; however, the increased power at 1.5 T was not statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) either for TBM, or for SIENA, a related method for computing volume loss rates. Analysis of cumulative distribution functions and false discovery rates showed that, at both field strengths, temporal lobe atrophy rates were correlated with interval decline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), mini-mental status exam (MMSE), and Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB) scores. Overall, 1.5 and 3 T scans did not significantly differ in their power to detect neurodegenerative changes over a year. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010.

ea0378ffb312a69f227f3e1310ead5cf0fdb63da,Applying shrinkage variance estimators to the TOST test in high dimensional settings,"Abstract Background: Identifying differentially expressed genes has been an important and widely used approach to investigate gene functions and molecular mechanisms. A related issue that has drawn much less attention but is equally important is the identification of constantly expressed genes across different conditions. A common practice is to treat genes that are not significantly differentially expressed as significantly equivalently expressed. Such naive practice often leads to large false discovery rate and low power. The more appropriate way for identifying constantly expressed genes should be conducting high dimensional statistical equivalence tests. A well-known equivalence test, the two one-sided tests (TOST), can be used for this purpose. However, due to the small sample sizes often associated with genomics data, the variance estimator in the TOST test could be unstable. Hence it would be fitting to examine the application of shrinkage variance estimators to the TOST test in high dimensional settings. Result: In this paper, we study the effect of shrinking the variance estimators in the TOST test in high dimensional settings through simulation studies. In addition, we derive analytic formulas for the p-value of the resultant shrinkage variance TOST test and apply it to a real data set.",2014,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Qiu"", ids = ""145505348""); list(name = ""Yue Qi"", ids = ""145008855""); list(name = ""Xiangqin Cui"", ids = ""123007147"")",8a97d896e136952ef4e1db5ce0bfced18dcd2238,74b51597159ced7c826332c3b20b5133d9b4a032; 05a2e5eb8025a147087bb57ac5ae00464dab6d90; 2dec3b5b5a58f48d694e5bb30f9e7387842398a7; 2af829f8416959bed471ff42a03a3f725b8da683; 0976d01fc11b500f4c199fae06475b8b526ac4f0; 4ae003c0a447922e2136e96cbd8987b90fbc19e8; 053b97e316fc43588e6235f88a1a7a4077342de7; 6e515620c752e248e1d03c4ab285c8254a482c62; 3c2824ab6d4fc4da7ccb3253ce122d75a78627a0; 1bdb480f609c7828f36f52f6b0ec33dbe2c8e65e; 22a9f9bcc02c3117f86768d2633b95340055ce23; f87d9cf13b45d41a0224433ad1695746f972bcce; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 541bc6421a66f4f1fcfb90e1c33c0a67ebc3f639; 8c932b33e1287c608d7618c6c30da8dd554e318b; ba048b0e07515c8c42304b5fe8fca3c9ba512b6d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; daf8ebed8b037b104b8cd36a878dde8da31c6bc5,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,13,323 - 341
111b7299a963c025ea31de88a37f917f813af913,Identification of metastasis-related genes by DNA microarray analyses on samples generated from a metastatic mouse model of head and neck cancer.,"204 To identify genes that mediate metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), a novel SCCHN xenograft mouse model has been established (Zhang et al. Cancer 95:1663, 2002). Using this model we performed in vivo selection from a SCCHN cell line. In the fourth round of in vivo selection, significant incidences of metastases in lymph nodes (7/10) and lungs (6/10) were achieved from a derived SCCHN cell line as compared with its parental cell line (1/5 in lymph nodes and 0/5 in lungs). Highly metastatic SCCHN cell lines were then established from lymph node metastatic tumors. The RNA from 18 metastatic cell lines (M) and 6 parental cell lines (P) isolated from nonmetastatic xenograft tumors were subjected to DNA microarray analysis using an Affymetrix gene chip HG-U133A. GCRMA in Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org) was used for probe analysis of the microarray data. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA), false discovery rate calculation (q-value 1.5) were sequentially performed to select the most significant genes. A total of 5234 genes were identified from 22,123 genes on the HG-U133A gene chip. Ontological classification and k-mean clustering of these genes revealed specific features of the metastatic SCCHN cells that are different from the non-metastatic parental cells, including (1) loss of expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins, such as down-regulation of cellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin [mean signal values (log-base 2): 2.3 (M) vs. 10.4 (P)]; (2) down-regulation of cellular feature proteins, such as a putative tumor suppressor caveolin-1 [2.6 (M) vs. 12 (P)] and a differentiation marker involucrin [2.3 (M) vs. 5.2 (P)], and up-regulation of prostate stem cell antigen [8.9 (M) vs. 3.5 (P)]; (3) up-regulation of signal transducers that induce migration and invasion, such as chemokine (C-X-C) motif receptor 4 [CXCR4, 9.0 (M) vs. 2.1 (P)]; (4) switching expression pattern of small Ca2+ binding proteins, such as enhancement of S100A4 [13.6 (M) vs. 6.3 (P)], but reduction of S100A2 [5.4 (M) vs. 13.9 (P)]; and (5) alterations of expression pattern of several cytokeratins. These genotypic changes support a phenotypic alteration, epithelia-mesenchymal transition, observed between the parental cells and their metastatic derivatives. After experimental validation, these genes as a group can potentially be used as â€œpredictorsâ€ for lymph node metastases of SCCHN (Supported by NIH grant R21 DE014767).",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhuo Georgia Chen"", ids = ""40046746""); list(name = ""Haiyan Wu"", ids = ""47987445""); list(name = ""Xiaomei Zhang"", ids = ""46447657""); list(name = ""Mi Sun Choe"", ids = ""5885578""); list(name = ""Ali Pirani"", ids = ""40536521""); list(name = ""Kim M.

27fce29197925c0eb6e32794e6b403d6ee98acb5,Study of polar metabolites in tobacco from different geographical origins by using capillary electrophoresisâ€“mass spectrometry,"Many metabolites in plant are highly polar and ionic. Their analysis using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry and liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry can be problematic. Therefore a capillary electrophoresisâ€“mass spectrometry (CEâ€“MS) method with charge-driven separation characteristic was developed to investigate polar metabolites in tobacco. To obtain as many features as possible, extraction of polar metabolites was optimized by the design of experiments and evaluated by univariate statistics. Method validation was carried out to evaluate the analytical characteristics including calibration curve, precision, sample stability and extraction reproducibility. The developed method was successfully applied in studying 30 tobacco leaves obtained from Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in China. A total of 154 polar metabolites were identified based on available database. Multivariate pattern recognition clearly revealed the metabolic differences between the two geographic areas and 43 significantly different metabolites were defined by the non-parametric hypothesis test (Mannâ€“Whitney U test) and false discovery rate. Some key metabolites involved in photosynthesis such as ribulose 1,5-disphosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, glycine, betaine, GABA and serine were found to be susceptible to environmental conditions. This study shows that the metabolic profiling based on CEâ€“MS can clearly discriminate tobacco leaves of different geographical origins and understand the relationship between plant metabolites and their geographical origins.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Jieyu Zhao"", ids = ""46508853""); list(name = ""Chunxiu Hu"", ids = ""4247634""); list(name = ""Jun Zeng"", ids = ""50409728""); list(name = ""Yanni Zhao"", ids = ""7637425""); list(name = ""Junjie Zhang"", ids = ""49050563""); list(name = ""Yuwei Chang"", ids = ""7312494""); list(name = ""Lili Li"", ids = ""39351681""); list(name = ""Chunxia Zhao"", ids = ""145838429""); list(name = ""Xin Lu"", ids = ""145574672""); list(name = ""Guowang Xu"", ids = ""143785383"")",ed0a6d5806d1e71e408f522e9c92f3274f10b6bd; 425d097ee768d577db4cb982df4c59468564675d; 3d21408fa2ca1c2cf99f08882cb93d8a3ea00b9d; 4d91bd486ff38de9a7ec6f1387457068c30839ae; a00c5d5a64f5b2ffb6497a06e50110ade2b63aac; e18438d3b5f09ccc986823140f4ceba287315180; f5843725d3ed7ac19d822376892769b24f171555; 0614feff9079fead29347c7bb8fdc16ca54804e3; 36912a789beb4409f8e15879ffd3e5776f38eb9a,12642f4238eccf5a82f4a4f2594e3eaf0c6cfb84; f15ae4f8493d707c9013ff472fa94006d2def3bb; ba0ecb9da0197af1045cd0d4d38ec4382987315e; 5e75d4d7c144573efd393acff38e8a726007b5fd; 59ac6e21b09edfac6511c9818a00a51ace05648d; 5089f552caaa5f5d53974ba66f8691617be88b09; 3c5aa65aa2e26a3442b21ad7ebcb6a73f4f28d5d; 76384c3c65fd3f4297794cb272bbe6d62e64e567; dadde2a2e52e1b257a3bd50c91528d13b033ade5; 222b5b859bf2972cf7b74b1af5c1301a2c83a701; 0a254a30e88ebdac18293f244813bfc2c014433a; ffd85f1bec0693210ea7b796e30301058a331c2f; c130112f0575df9729b6ed5950486b876d89d795; 0a39177274316b113ec69f09a2fcfa91a4bea984; 06a6abcd632dba72d9fe95d558daea8a1e29e2ac; af46c8ffaacd3f4b889347729e58a41ee88e38ca; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 73c8e8dbca3053e5a5e5fe1ba38b7858e567a473; bf73b57123057f91fbbddbdd4ea8384a860a46af; e6812479e985c18aff11fb6dea4f76a0b0b735cd; 35767623f54575d18d88344d117a70f18426b406; 94c0dc81db5f3ce8661aa32a8f1f8d6ae0e863ee; a4454b7189fb39f48dc36149ac57bb137f2a95b5; a28b9ca609df86dad2a5705e63513f03e4a7f67e; 0095e15b6e7c71de23c9352c856f2bf979bf62c9; 5fabfe8508cf0e17e6131b505e56a1e2a3299862; 684372af88a6152f3e700faa794acc924157819c; f9867f2a4f90fb6f4cb71f4e1512251b9c286632; e32b66d007ec5ba4cd21eb3d10558d31d013cecf; f56903fd4209c2d4867d9f43f2576751d7008ee2; 80ed5f05bcab77c23634ef6d01ccda42234c6853; be9d1bac06e6096699f53c47eaa664abd28153e3; 85029ae821b6ef335e8aa3ee68ddf2733b3fdd75; ca2677418a5602908a2407b0ca22740fc0b9f4e5; 43220a5b048221fa7957115391f6361bd4d5559d; 8d5770a10c64ccc503e7d69c6e71ae43670431ca; 1f0aa2f6de944611f3d758e5929ac7512c3e8017; e56be2bd9dd0065ca84c219a3cdc8721cf321090; 77162748a36662f965604e398ab9e624fee9e6bf; b8e21cdd7816e3c7631879dc0309716cb1213558; 6c8d3b943138d0c26ba836fa893354fa91969129; c68940ed76a2c5cf438513a59da3f186305d838e; f01a7e2f7f107f4795d64933eee1a291595752a6; 840a0f8cc99f5fe976fcc17d78004cff5fc9f670; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8606392c4e9e307b38ad355272ed5ef03a5a6f43; ad821949f80713f3a8221fe825c13d47a4b5c0ec; d202f0450673793f6cf5d1115d893314720f4393; d0ff3de7e9c16d8686ec299ffb30de40db745fca; f510a144ceb8d7e472b7952b87a60b5a582a44cc; e64961c04ccf4562b2a7bf02d91f657af86252e3,Metabolomics,10,805-815
bb44e77ba273fb87729c9d3f87a784c238f11b16,Survival analysis of longitudinal microarrays,"MOTIVATION
The development of methods for linking gene expressions to various clinical and phenotypic characteristics is an active area of genomic research. Scientists hope that such analysis may, for example, describe relationships between gene function and clinical events such as death or recovery. Methods are available for relating gene expression to measurements that are categorized or continuous, but there is less work in relating expressions to an observed event time such as time to death, response or relapse. When gene expressions are measured over time, there are methods for differentiating temporal patterns. However, methods have not yet been proposed for the survival analysis of longitudinally collected microarrays.


RESULTS
We describe an approach for the survival analysis of longitudinal gene expression data. We construct a measure of association between the time to an event and gene expressions collected over time. Statistical significance is addressed using permutations and control of the false discovery rate. Our proposed method is illustrated on a dataset from a multi-center research study of inflammation and response to injury that aims to uncover the biological reasons why patients can have dramatically different outcomes after suffering a traumatic injury (www.gluegrant.org).",2006,Computer Science; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Natasa Rajicic"", ids = ""2735642""); list(name = ""Dianne M.

Objective: Analyze how precursor and fragment mass tolerance affect the number of true positives and false positives. Introduction: Mass spectrometry coupled to database searching is a powerful and popular protein identification tool. A typical shotgun proteomics experiment begins with degrading intact proteins into peptides. The peptide mixture then undergoes LC-MS/MS analysis, and the resulting experimental spectra are compared to theoretical spectra derived from protein, cDNA, or EST databases. Successful database searching is dependent on database size, post-translational modifications, and precursor and fragment ion m/z tolerance. Method: A standard protein set was made containing 62 verified T. cruzi recombinant proteins spiked into an E. coli lysate. This mixture was digested then analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an LTQ-Orbitrap. Resulting spectra were searched against forward, reverse, and concatenated databases using Sequest, Mascot, and X!Tandem. Peptide probabilities were calculated using ProteinProphet, and peptide false discovery rates (FDR's) were calculated by using ProteoIQ. It is necessary to use a standardized protein mixture to determine the number of true positives (T. cruzi proteins) and false positives (random proteins) found as a function of m/z search tolerance. Preliminary Results: At a 95% probability, more true positives are discovered as ion precursor mass accuracy is increased; however, more false positives are also discovered and at a higher rate. For example, as mass accuracy is increased from +/âˆ’1000ppm to +/âˆ’20ppm, the number of spectra corresponding to true positives increases by 50% while the number for false positives increases by 380%. Using a 5% FDR filter with the same mass accuracy change yields a 37% increase in true positive matches, while leaving the number of false positives unchanged. Conclusions: FDR filtering can result in more successful data validation than probability filtering when performing high resolution mass spectrometry.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ron Orlando"", ids = ""145137565""); list(name = ""Jae-min Lim"", ids = ""152357169""); list(name = ""G.

adb8e3ba152a88e30d4469c70013e82bc6c8ed0d,Longitudinal cerebral diffusion changes reflect progressive decline of language and cognition,"Language deficits are regularly found in cortical neurodegenerative diseases. The progression of language deficits shows a considerable inter-individual variability even within one diagnostic group. We aimed at detecting patterns of altered diffusion as well as atrophy of cerebral gray and white matter which underlie ongoing language-related deterioration in patients with cortical neurodegenerative diseases. Diffusion tensor imaging and T1-weighted MRI data of 26 patients with clinically diagnosed neurodegenerative disorders were acquired at baseline and 14 months later in this prospective study. Language functions were assessed with a confrontation naming test and the Token Test. Diffusion and voxel-based morphometric measures were calculated and correlates of language performance were evaluated. Across all patients, the naming impairment was related to diffusion (false discovery rate-corrected P<0.05 at baseline) and atrophy abnormalities (family-wise error (FWE)-corrected P<0.05 at follow-up) primarily in the left temporal lobe. Deficits in the Token Test were correlated with predominantly left frontal MRI abnormalities (FWE-corrected P<0.05). The Token Test performance decline over 14 months was accompanied by further increasing abnormalities in the frontal cortex, left caudate, parietal cortex (all FWE-corrected P<0.05), and posterior callosal body (FWE-corrected P=0.055). Both diffusion and structural MRI were apt to elucidate the underpinnings of inter-individual differences in language-related deficits and to detect longitudinal changes that accompanied ongoing cognition and language decline, with mean diffusivity appearing most sensitive. This might indicate the usefulness of diffusion measures as markers for successful intervention in therapy studies.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lars Frings"", ids = ""2941350""); list(name = ""Katharina Dressel"", ids = ""2143051""); list(name = ""Stefanie Abel"", ids = ""40536330""); list(name = ""Irina Mader"", ids = ""48205874""); list(name = ""Michael Huell"", ids = ""49919494"")",abf74a8ddcd85bacc8c57d4209562aa4c2cb3671; f338fef6259e5b88f09094b22474d2cc662f6995; 26057d7931eec69db3380047c79f1717c8117bae; 1d2f908c13f79cf527291c650290396cd26965bd; f033f4a72e65fc3ab55eafe0592873087e0861a1,,Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging,214,395-401
c00b478214a8fab34487e046fc299311cf0efb7d,The cortical distribution of first and second language in the right hemisphere of bilinguals â€“ an exploratory study by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation,"First language (L1) and second language (L2) processing in bilinguals is not yet fully understood, especially not when considering the non-dominant hemisphere. Ten healthy, right-handed volunteers underwent language mapping of the right hemisphere by repetitive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and an object-naming task in their L1 and L2. All elicited naming errors together, no responses, and all errors without hesitation were analyzed separately for cortical distributions of error rates (ERs: number of errors divided by the number of applied stimulations). No significant differences (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) were found in ERs between the L1 and L2 for all errors (L1 20.6â€‰Â±â€‰14.8%, L2 15.4â€‰Â±â€‰11.2%), no responses (L1 13.5â€‰Â±â€‰10.9%, L2 9.2â€‰Â±â€‰10.8%), and all errors without hesitation (L1 14.4â€‰Â±â€‰11.2%, L2 10.8â€‰Â±â€‰10.0%). The areas that showed high ERs for the L1 included the dorsal precentral and middle precentral gyrus, whereas the triangular inferior frontal gyrus showed high ERs for the L2. When focusing on error distributions per single stimulation points, differences in ERs between the L1 and L2 were initially observed for stimulation within the angular and middle middle frontal gyrus, but did not withstand correction for the false discovery rate (FDR-corrected pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). In conclusion, this exploratory study shows the feasibility of rTMS to the right hemisphere for language mapping and reveals cortical areas involved in L1 and L2 processing, but has to be followed up by larger studies enrolling more homogeneous cohorts.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lorena Tussis"", ids = ""5635151""); list(name = ""Nico Sollmann"", ids = ""3252436""); list(name = ""Tobias Boeckh-Behrens"", ids = ""1397425233""); list(name = ""Bernhard Meyer"", ids = ""144105427""); list(name = ""Sandro M.

2e25a5cc260fd59f1bd39f2cab74b5a63cd55045,Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Rectal Tissue from Beef Steers Revealed Reduced Host Immunity in Escherichia coli O157:H7 Super-Shedders,"Super-shedder cattle are a major disseminator of E. coli O157:H7 into the environment, and the terminal rectum has been proposed as the primary E. coli O157:H7 colonization site. This study aimed to identify host factors that are associated with the super-shedding process by comparing transcriptomic profiles in rectal tissue collected from 5 super-shedder cattle and 4 non-shedder cattle using RNA-Seq. In total, 17,859 Â± 354 genes and 399 Â± 16 miRNAs were detected, and 11,773 genes were expressed in all animals. Fifty-eight differentially expressed (DE) genes (false discovery rate < 0.05) including 11 up-regulated and 47 down-regulated (log 2 (fold change) ranged from -5.5 to 4.2), and 2 up-regulated DE miRNAs (log 2 (fold change) = 2.1 and 2.5, respectively) were identified in super-shedders compared to non-shedders. Functional analysis of DE genes revealed that 31 down-regulated genes were potentially associated with reduced innate and adaptive immune functions in super-shedders, including 13 lymphocytes membrane receptors, 3 transcription factors and 5 cytokines, suggesting the decreased key host immune functions in the rectal tissue of super-shedders, including decreased quantity and migration of immune cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. The up-regulation of bta-miR-29d-3p and the down regulation of its predicted target gene, regulator of G-protein signaling 13, suggested a potential regulatory role of this miRNA in decreased migration of lymphocytes in super-shedders. Based on these findings, the rectal tissue of super-shedders may inherently exhibit less effective innate and adaptive immune protection. Further study is required to confirm if such effect on host immunity is due to the nature of the host itself or due to actions mediated by E. coli O157:H7.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ou Wang"", ids = ""49031572""); list(name = ""Guanxiang Liang"", ids = ""4515053""); list(name = ""Tim A McAllister"", ids = ""34789352""); list(name = ""Graham Plastow"", ids = ""34998118""); list(name = ""Kim Stanford"", ids = ""144384159""); list(name = ""Brent L Selinger"", ids = ""40086845""); list(name = ""Le Luo Guan"", ids = ""7514762"")",286a97bffa060b684330c1db70b1432724e745c9; a235d6d9fccd5c9ec552a1f83f1675f7951e5c15; 9cdb5e570b28d3b9d37991c8378bbf921038bd8f; 02da4457bb47ad28d6f77dc8579587e75202afec,855cde8e975a5b6d2c3e3c689c70c79ce53fd4e3; ddabf262d3e488ebf6935e2e93de50e07c054f77; d2b4151811ed9f18013123d417c9732f93b73c49; ae8a22d60ad78d29fb2aa002ec6f89a6fee3ab61; 2048c148f1b6054515f3ee96d5829f0c606bfa12; 69a3b6499c9df1f0f88a58764f45605b69584417; 6db6ac287d9b46eaf71cb216e71022549a65ac16; ee3387e318b0821aca912e785d614bc2eaea2615; 156f9016258dd032c967972e9843d7293429bb9b; 833c98278ca2a8cbe47cfbbdd91d4d79314da3ed; 7fe5e8e2e3d8aeaf380787b2034fef1111af56fc; 86bb660d8bffc3b5a1c85c10e47d6543291811e8; 0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7; 7299e65912bae10d46f711fa5e3ac16156eb12f6; d39a75c9dc386eaa04a3ff3bd39d56eb2224df6e; 92d4a89f9a7a8d8bcb5536ca832e151f82b5e68a; 0c9349734a8de1fe070be6e9fafa056536c5e1ee; 8ebb062718a26e3343cd1c0508078895e5bc6a20; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 1286da9582a9b58112876fabdb8cff6cdcbad7cf; 09505ee5afc1207b5225ffba884d76ffe7f3405b; 68b6e2ba4a95b497b3df8466e56c521933d9428f; c69d5d7dabc0e56bce72637916a938f607a46afc; 5568473bd3ef0a2a172152fa9eb5df6a79066ded; e92f1b0a3b6065cba757ebaeec0ea718f7cb1948; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; c8478fa5d497c7233c96308480220ef275f76b5b; a6cd6091861768c3894cac94bc6bfa921f07e70c; 8d7b502f720f1ac65eddf842543409373ca4bab8; 8f3020f28add7ca2b4a82f9f6e5ed3b0db35f6d3; bdc4ad823f8c0ca6563f25eea1d26be5a2051fae; 5f1ba5988a2e51a99049c353febbb2994d8c660b; f6477b5366cc582bc6c6bf9f13b06739fd5a2e75; 12448b4d308bc62f37a5b21fa59047b9b0e508f4; 17863b0cb0eb6140d388cf6db3b68734e1c0c2b9; 9a03b4d68691edabe811b18557301bda4340dfd7; a5d73a85e9f58522c1024d8b6b04d338739f123c; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; be480d48ca3c269e47e61234c1c1a02a701b471f; 4a95ac443c2d172f9b4a0a9e583563b664bc92b3; 5c9c211cf2fd3eae9dd3c1f541f6a217c92541ec; 4eddfcb8984e26257facb4a899887347e61c97cb; e64e63662f1d083f49a510faa6e1b3b08ea76baf; d9af4140fd6ff7a4c4ed6a0afc290317a6d7eb1e; d8f0c5a61ac86237d4978f68ed9cc7647068d5be; 09d72345ad48864f41f20a608873554ef6b3c86c; 54137cc381b74d017295e9bc610f934a7e90a232; 8f8c9bd653d5df34e66f983366f51247b2a5983d; c190c39f9ebd9ee69b41573ae1ac4b8170d61569; be577aca5f8415fce9f84bdd5a5fd453cc4bbd5a; 4e0127b4ba54ada429d55979df1227d6de9e146d; e0a7f7ab60cc2cb2d157ce4ae9c9d39ec6d84968; 3663c6a2f66b91f5e034bdd8eca4bb46eaba18d7; 7bc79b087752eaa5becab269c31dc145db9c47de; 43a8cbb0fec471528164ea3145b68752fe463664; 935852906ee5c93642416e1123ac686d68194988; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 760c6aa5e937185d8c6fc73b35c67facd77dbcd1; a7633c18b2d804e9c5a0dcf6c800713b399b3424; a030e8591c57b9bd0b07a01a7e386f14ff6d95fb; 85ec34276e2c55c4e46dd026422aa25f5b961f16; 081f42c160e12f98bd6d0f0c49cce37fba011357; 5e6c32c83d8a37d14035ec261d591de0059a5625; 63191d2758860c24eacb09700ea0c0d63b03d1ca; 36a30f4ec9954ba3112acdf24efd3aea9babda3f; 623811c52a3f09aeb03e56d4cafe32d6bec20ba5; ec7e324e55ecc5ccfafd2f3027894593d133feb1; 447bf5edc72aa9b8c96f841ff11e8f47e89d2ec4; 58d94af33a5f5b2682071c21e61f23905602ba2b,PLoS ONE,11,

Trained muscles (at W10) showed changes in the transcriptome signature regarding the regulation of energy metabolism, favouring a more oxidative one, upregulated antioxidant- and immune-related genes/terms, and gene transcripts related to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, muscle contraction, development and growth.ConclusionsThese results highlight that chronic repetition of RE changes muscle transcriptome response towards a more refined response to RE-induced stress.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Felipe Damas"", ids = ""49987425""); list(name = ""Carlos Ugrinowitsch"", ids = ""6457126""); list(name = ""Cleiton Augusto Libardi"", ids = ""4520477""); list(name = ""Paulo Roberto Jannig"", ids = ""5797224""); list(name = ""Amy J.

2eefc2b08ac3f1608fe39bfa78e1274b76f3bc2c,A Tight Prediction Interval for False Discovery Proportion under Dependence,"The false discovery proportion (FDP) is a useful measure of abundance of false positives when a large number of hypotheses are being tested simultaneously. Methods for controlling the expected value of the FDP, namely the false discovery rate (FDR), have become widely used. It is highly desired to have an accurate prediction interval for the FDP in such applications. Some degree of dependence among test statistics exists in almost all applications involving multiple testing. Methods for constructing tight prediction intervals for the FDP that take account of dependence among test statistics are of great practical importance. This paper derives a formula for the variance of the FDP and uses it to obtain an upper prediction interval for the FDP, under some semi-parametric assumptions on dependence among test statistics. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed formula-based prediction interval has good coverage probability under commonly assumed weak dependence. The prediction interval is generally more accurate than those obtained from existing methods. In addition, a permutation-based upper prediction interval for the FDP is provided, which can be useful when dependence is strong and the number of tests is not too large. The proposed prediction intervals are illustrated using a prostate cancer dataset.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shulian Shang"", ids = ""39913211""); list(name = ""Mengling Liu"", ids = ""49353970""); list(name = ""Yongzhao Shao"", ids = ""145464656"")",e570728b6966e4e1c143da60e8256f13e948d4e7; 2352260cf0eb99321b34c57be2424679cf957d87,6c85d83cc4468b0881c959aa2a84defc09b412df; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; 671faa0432c0e4bfeef32e7731f7f5e191ebacfd; f76398dcde5c88ec607503d438d6967875cf7fe4; 9c0cbf5c274100e29d0c4fee9d99387f450e129a; bd53ebf7e28d0ee4d6904be1875c5a931d5b28bf; 81e2fd87effcb34ba2fca6217e6e25da86015b88; 54339edf70fb5eadd89fc609546bc0f5c0a08f59; 3209b7e1dde59a28b7452e19b884d45ccb1bc704; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 6a17464d5452d257cba944342e067b49228bdaaa; 1973f94f357cbffa8e845c7e13e630382c1d83e7; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; c7bfc30fd1a857eb7889f71fa1560567d7bf1651; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 08d23fdaeec2a46da5189cf105de238fb37bb77e; 523d8aa0aae3239b82a499562c0696118edf67d3; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; e8794b45aea8712a86fcd4c2ce636ca3e8cffd5b,Open Journal of Statistics,02,163-171
b566e156cdf79f981fd8d8f969119b0a58e3ae05,Dietary haem stimulates epithelial cell turnover by downregulating feedback inhibitors of proliferation in murine colon.,"OBJECTIVE
Colon cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in Western countries and is associated with diets high in red meat. Haem, the iron-porphyrin pigment of red meat, induces cytotoxicity of gut contents and damages the colon surface epithelium. Compensatory hyperproliferation leads to epithelial hyperplasia which increases the risk of colon cancer. The aim of this study was to identify molecules signalling from the surface epithelium to the crypt to initiate hyperproliferation upon stress induced by haem.


METHODS
C57Bl6/J mice (n=9/group) received a 'westernised' control diet (40 en% fat) with or without 0.5 Î¼mol/g haem for 14 days. Colon mucosa was used to quantify cell proliferation and for microarray transcriptome analysis. Gene expression profiles of surface and crypt cells were compared using laser capture microdissection. Protein levels of potential signalling molecules were quantified.


RESULTS
Haem-fed mice showed epithelial hyperproliferation and decreased apoptosis, resulting in hyperplasia. Microarray analysis of the colon mucosa showed 3710 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate (q) <0.01), with many involved in the cell cycle. Expression levels of haem- and stress-related genes showed that haem affected surface cells but did not directly affect crypt cells. Injured surface cells should therefore signal to crypt cells to induce compensatory hyperproliferation. Haem downregulated the inhibitors of proliferation, Wnt inhibitory factor 1, Indian Hedgehog and bone morphogenetic protein 2. Interleukin-15 was also downregulated. Haem upregulated amphiregulin, epiregulin and cyclo-oxygenase-2 mRNA in surface cells. Their protein/metabolite levels were, however, not increased as haem induced surface-specific inhibition of translation by increasing 4E-BP1.


CONCLUSIONS
Haem induces colonic hyperproliferation and hyperplasia by inhibiting the surface to crypt signalling of feedback inhibitors of proliferation.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Noortje Ijssennagger"", ids = ""4675719""); list(name = ""Anneke Rijnierse"", ids = ""4686497""); list(name = ""Nicole J.

44d46da9e5dd15f8ab0cee0beda9f9c92b73a81f,Psychosocial treatments in bipolar disorder.,"We read with interest the Comment by Tim Kendall and colleagues, in response to our Personal View on NICE guidance on psychosocial treatments in bipolar disorder. We feel that this Comment raises more questions than it answers. Two issues seem particularly important. Despite carrying out almost 200 metaanalyses on fewer than 50 studies, more than half being meta-analyses of single trials, Kendall and colleagues remain unconcerned about multiple comparisons. They refer to Schulz and Grimes, who stated that using the sort of correction we propose might sabotage interpretation of clinical trials reporting several endpoints. Few clinical trials, however, contain 200 endpoints and Schulz and Grimes further state that if a trial reports results on, say, 15 endpoints with one being signifi cant, appropriate caution should be displayed. Furthermore, we did not propose using Bonferroni correction (as alluded to by Kendall and colleagues), we recommended the less conservative false discovery rate (FDR) approach. As noted by Matt and Cook, â€œAlthough research syntheses may combine fi ndings from hundreds of studies and thousands of respondents, they are not immune to inflated type I error when many statistical tests are conducted without adequate control for error rateâ€ and they refer to the threat of â€œcapitalising on chance in meta-analysisâ€. Kendall and colleaguesâ€™ explanation for exclusion of the study by Scott and colleagues from the meta-analysis of relapse was that it included patients who were not euthymic at baseline. We considered this, but discounted it after discovering another trial in the same meta-analysis included patients who were explicitly depressed or hypomanic at baseline. Two other trials in the same meta-analysis did not specify whether their patients were euthymic at baseline: it seems unlikely that such information would be reliably retrievable in one of these studies, done over 30 years ago. The response by Kendall and colleagues still does not account for why the study by Scott and colleagues was included in meta-analyses for depressive and manic relapse considered separately, as we pointed out.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sameer Jauhar"", ids = ""6338293""); list(name = ""P.

We have developed a novel statistical method of clustering dynamics to elucidate for the mapping of gene expression arcs. In the current study, we applied these techniques to the multifactorial process of vein graft intimal hyperplasia, where direct correlation of these patterns was integrated with detailed morphologic data to identify those pathways central to the disease process. Methods: NZW rabbits underwent bilateral carotid vein grafting and unilateral distal branch ligation to create high and low shear environments. Vein grafts were harvested at 2h, 1 d, 7 ds, 28 d, 90 d, and 180 d (n=4 per group), and mRNA expression analyzed using a rabbit Agilent microarray platform. Parallel experiments were used to determine wall morphology, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and matrix content at each time point. Results: Compared to high shear grafts, exposure to a low shear resulted in a 5-fold greater intimal thickness at 180 d. Although 3365 (out of 14,958) genes varied with either time or shear, no single gene was significantly different (at a false discovery rate Conclusions: Using high throughput genomics and detailed morphologic data, we identify cell death, matrix degradation, and matrix synthesis, and the specific pathways associated with these process, as the most critical components in the development of the intimal hyperplastic lesion.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Khayree Butler"", ids = ""12062391""); list(name = ""Zhihua Jiang"", ids = ""47653923""); list(name = ""Kerri A.

To address this question, we analyzed HARDI data from 92 twins and fitted quantitative genetic models to model individual variations in white matter integrity between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. We used a cross-trait cross-twin design to determine (1) where in the brain fiber integrity was linked with intellectual performance; and (2) to what extent genetic factors mediated this correlation. Methods: 30-gradient HARDI data were acquired from 23 MZ twin pairs (22M/24F; age = 25.1Â±1.5 years) and 23 same-sex DZ twin pairs (20M/26F; age: 23.5Â±2.1 years) on a 4T Bruker Medspec MRI scanner, as 27 diffusion-weighted (b = 1132 s/mm2) and 3 nondiffusion weighted volumes per subject: gradient directions were uniformly distributed on an imaginary sphere. Imaging parameters were: 21 axial slices (5 mm thick; 0.5 mm gap), 23 cm FOV, TR/TE 6090/91.7 ms, 1.8x1.8 mm2 in-plane resolution; scan time: 3.05 minutes. HARDI data were registered by fluidly matching their corresponding diffusion tensor images (DTI), using an information-theoretic overlap measure (the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence). We then computed 3D maps of WM integrity based on the generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA), which generalizes the FA concept from singletensor DTI to HARDI [1]. To analyze genetic influences on WM integrity, we fitted structural equation models (SEM), to estimate the additive genetic (A), shared environmental (C) and unique environmental (E) components of variance in GFA at each voxel. The significance of genetic effects on GFA was evaluated by comparing the full ACE versus the reduced CE models. We then tested whether any regional correlations between WM integrity and intellectual performance were mediated by common genetic factors, by fitting cross-trait cross-twin models at every voxel. Results: The first column in Fig. 1 shows that there are highly significant genetic influences on fiber integrity (GFA), using the false discovery rate method (FDR <0.05) to correct for multiple comparisons. The other three columns present the percentage contributions of A, C, and E components to the variance in GFA. White matter integrity in regions of high diffusion anisotropy (FA > 0.3) was under strong genetic control, especially in the corpus callosum, the left cerebral peduncle, inferior longitudinal fasciculus/inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, left posterior thalamic radiation/optic radiation, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the superior and posterior corona radiata bilaterally. In these regions, the strong correlation between GFA and intellectual performance was mediated by common genetic factors (Fig. 2; ra denotes the genetic correlation coefficient). Similar patterns were Page 1 of 2 Printable Preview 1/9/2009 https://www.meetingassistant2.com/OHBM2009/core_routines/print_preview.php?abstr... noted for full-scale IQ (FIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and object assembly (OBJ, a component sub-test of PIQ). Conclusions: Measures of white matter integrity derived from HARDI are highly heritable. Higher GFA is linked with better intellectual performance, especially with performance IQ, and this linkage is of genetic origin. These heritable traits will expedite the search for specific genes influencing cognition and white matter integrity in the brain.

Current statistical methods for microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis generally assume certain relationships among adjacent markers on the same chromosome, and these assumptions may be questionable. For an SNP-array-based CGH study, multiple normal reference SNP arrays were collected. In order to utilize these normal reference SNP arrays, we derived an empirical distribution of signal ratios for each SNP marker. With an assumed threshold value for the overall error rate control and the defined signal ratio ranges for chromosomal amplification and deletion, we proposed a procedure to identify chromosomal alteration regions based on several bootstrapped one-sample t-tests and the false discovery rate control. When we have multiple arrays for different individuals with the same disease, our method can also be used to detect SNP markers for chromosomal alteration regions that are common among these individuals. We applied our method to a published SNP array data set for breast carcinoma cell lines. For an individual with breast cancer, numerous chromosomal alteration regions were identified. Compared to results of previous studies, our method identified more chromosomal alteration regions, with some being implicated in the literature to harbor genes associated with breast cancer. For multiple cancer arrays, our results suggested the existence of common chromosomal alteration regions.

732e6976bdbd069f0f0f304ddea70bb09a783e38,Open MS/MS spectral library search to identify unanticipated post-translational modifications and increase spectral identification rate,"MOTIVATION
Identification of post-translationally modified proteins has become one of the central issues of current proteomics. Spectral library search is a new and promising computational approach to mass spectrometry-based protein identification. However, its potential in identification of unanticipated post-translational modifications has rarely been explored. The existing spectral library search tools are designed to match the query spectrum to the reference library spectra with the same peptide mass. Thus, spectra of peptides with unanticipated modifications cannot be identified.


RESULTS
In this article, we present an open spectral library search tool, named pMatch. It extends the existing library search algorithms in at least three aspects to support the identification of unanticipated modifications. First, the spectra in library are optimized with the full peptide sequence information to better tolerate the peptide fragmentation pattern variations caused by some modification(s). Second, a new scoring system is devised, which uses charge-dependent mass shifts for peak matching and combines a probability-based model with the general spectral dot-product for scoring. Third, a target-decoy strategy is used for false discovery rate control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of pMatch, a library search experiment was conducted on a public dataset with over 40,000 spectra in comparison with SpectraST, the most popular library search engine. Additional validations were done on four published datasets including over 150,000 spectra. The results showed that pMatch can effectively identify unanticipated modifications and significantly increase spectral identification rate.

Several key immunological regulators, including Interleukin (IL)-6 are intimately associated with rheumatoid arthritis disease progression. In this proof-of-concept case study we assess the immunological changes in multiple important immune cell populations to treatment with the commonly applied bDMARD tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor. 
Methods: Peripheral blood was obtained from one rheumatoid arthritis patient with poor response to conventional DMARD, before biological treatment and 4 months after. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted and separated into CD14+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD56+ immune cells. Each cell-type was prepared through a discovery proteomics pipeline, and analyzed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer by gel-free shotgun proteomics. 
Results: The patient responded well to tocilizumab monotherapy, and reached clinical remission without any observed side effects. A combined total of 4,343 proteins were identified at <1% false discovery rate, hereof 3,242 proteins qualified for label free quantification. We systematically evaluated the metabolic, inflammatory and signaling pathways of each immune cell type as a result of the IL-6R inhibition. The CD14+ cells were the most responsive to therapy, and proteins involved in the JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways were less abundant.

9a9b891e91a7dd46effd2b453d1f835e11772893,A prospective evaluation of plasma polyphenol levels and colon cancer risk,"Polyphenols have been shown to exert biological activity in experimental models of colon cancer; however, human data linking specific polyphenols to colon cancer is limited. We assessed the relationship between pre-diagnostic plasma polyphenols and colon cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, we measured concentrations of 35 polyphenols in plasma from 809 incident colon cancer cases and 809 matched controls. We used multivariable adjusted conditional logistic regression models that included established colon cancer risk factors. The false discovery rate (qvalues ) was computed to control for multiple comparisons. All statistical tests were two-sided. After false discovery rate correction and in continuous log2 -transformed multivariable models, equol (odds ratio [OR] per log2 -value, 0.86, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]â€‰=â€‰0.79-0.93; qvalue â€‰=â€‰0.01) and homovanillic acid (OR per log2 -value, 1.46, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.16-1.84; qvalue â€‰=â€‰0.02) were associated with colon cancer risk. Comparing extreme fifths, equol concentrations were inversely associated with colon cancer risk (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.61, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.41-0.91, ptrend â€‰=â€‰0.003), while homovanillic acid concentrations were positively associated with colon cancer development (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.72, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.17-2.53, ptrend â€‰<â€‰0.0001). No heterogeneity for these associations was observed by sex and across other colon cancer risk factors. The remaining polyphenols were not associated with colon cancer risk. Higher equol concentrations were associated with lower risk, and higher homovanillic acid concentrations were associated with greater risk of colon cancer. These findings support a potential role for specific polyphenols in colon tumorigenesis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Neil Murphy"", ids = ""144367387""); list(name = ""David Achaintre"", ids = ""4844586""); list(name = ""Raul Zamora-Ros"", ids = ""1398074765""); list(name = ""Mazda Jenab"", ids = ""77383407""); list(name = ""Marie-Christine Boutron-Ruault"", ids = ""1388894949""); list(name = ""Franck Carbonnel"", ids = ""6323479""); list(name = ""Isabelle Savoye"", ids = ""4566420""); list(name = ""Rudolf Kaaks"", ids = ""47394390""); list(name = ""Tilman KÃ¼hn"", ids = ""1771263""); list(name = ""Heiner Boeing"", ids = ""143754577""); list(name = ""Krasimira Aleksandrova"", ids = ""144393938""); list(name = ""Anne TjÃ¸nneland"", ids = ""6297147""); list(name = ""Cecilie KyrÃ¸"", ids = ""117501816""); list(name = ""Kim Overvad"", ids = ""5334190""); list(name = ""JosÃ© RamÃ³n QuirÃ³s"", ids = ""4031691""); list(name = ""Maria-JosÃ© Sanchez"", ids = ""144163109""); list(name = ""Jone Miren Altzibar"", ids = ""6930281""); list(name = ""JosÃ© MarÃ­a Huerta"", ids = ""121951148""); list(name = ""Aurelio Barricarte"", ids = ""4499510""); list(name = ""Kay-Tee Khaw"", ids = ""144270127""); list(name = ""Kathryn E Bradbury"", ids = ""5678108""); list(name = ""Aurora Perez-Cornago"", ids = ""1398202234""); list(name = ""Antonia Trichopoulou"", ids = ""115779197""); list(name = ""Anna Karakatsani"", ids = ""6236106""); list(name = ""Eleni Peppa"", ids = ""4015374""); list(name = ""Domenico Palli"", ids = ""6308257""); list(name = ""Sara Grioni"", ids = ""5412134""); list(name = ""Rosario Tumino"", ids = ""143843227""); list(name = ""Carlotta Sacerdote"", ids = ""3859009""); list(name = ""Salvatore Panico"", ids = ""5747274""); list(name = ""H.

In this study, we proposed a new mapping method for QTL detection in pure-line populations derived from four-way crosses, which is able to control the background genetic variation through a two-stage mapping strategy. First, orthogonal variables were created for each marker and used in an inclusive linear model, so as to completely absorb the genetic variation in the mapping population. Second, inclusive composite interval mapping approach was implemented for one-dimensional scanning, during which the inclusive linear model was employed to control the background variation. Simulation studies using different genetic models demonstrated that the new method is efficient when considering high detection power, low false discovery rate and high accuracy in estimating quantitative trait loci locations and effects. For illustration, the proposed method was applied in a reported wheat four-way recombinant inbred line population.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Shanqing Zhang"", ids = ""51013294""); list(name = ""L Meng"", ids = ""48153580""); list(name = ""Junjun Wang"", ids = ""48094021""); list(name = ""Lixia Zhang"", ids = ""48571052"")",c9bfad3af52d6eb930b21735080f93a83b7cfb07; 55e11a1f842738c6d442390a0a6627ea2fbf071b; 934a774fbc79d4dcb17e8f3465b3591b8f6336b2; a345d8c4282740c3bf7fd5fde2aa157f93a1d6a0; 334f1e0b53dc6e657dec3bc4b383dfa994f82c14; cf6ce9f485f23022aad9d5a08e00611644b39716; bc7613dde76cf5e461d6cd226fab1b22f21861dc; 2eab1b1e221c5ce955fa245cd15aadad051bf545; d96848a3841562b0bd628d560e8bd5ddf978ba7d,bd5a523eb448382c74398447b1ef256714f88e27; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 86d9dccaf1431bfe47c6b2a7d8ad246b14562963; e93fdfb498ba593c2a4df0e761f05f00d623cc15; 67b7943dda1bb8b4ebfdd207b21577fb0b2f7670; f7aff6a7cd863284967463a04e7be2360f3d2e60; 96be493d2d823b6531579f2bb48ea766db0f5897; 357d3bd74b21c849cba1c63ef5daf3352fc453f9; a2f10e46db3842b974521907b0132d533e4eb963; 3b33d466619863e33b889b7074002605e1d93623; ee628eafa770118bff745fd2cf8578d53ff15d51; dd4fb3fc02418eea99672c02f55a36bb59930d23; b621dfad3b09467fc1c5596c52d4e7746bdbea8f; 72a5a07fbf35ba49471b7c6e335949375fcec02a; 297a68c09801ce7bb3a3c33c4e1092265a2f50c1; ad48f689d81d8714c9e04eb94ed3f07e929e63d1; 5144b10cf9b18e437490af8acec266e1adb862ea; 65e05675a9684861f2508c52810a4ce0a6a29099; 0cf1d3f289051f8c1a9acff003ff69069241bb16; e9af3d5db4d7a6bf025a35e695afbb18ae93fe16; 0c5d5289e8e67c715f52f02d808eb906ff680786; 5cfa5bee56104c096ec321c729b403540d8c297d; 702773e40133afd0f967edd333f36f51ace23f6c; b6afca9b92a23bfd8df4bd45bd4a8b2cb1d67cfa; ff0359359ec561d4ec100c7ca43c9d69a88dd063; 46f0e76d7e65df27b885dc1d07e342fa1b37db8a; 0905ac210e5a66a72bad51ebe25aed486cbb35c0; 65e9fb489f7c5976d390fe81e56c22f09835c2c5; 74a9ebc89085397da23d217cf068692b9b8d5e1a; 25da19c11d3c58e787710628c80b77fd5e5ba140; 520b4da6c2cf095a38cea5ebd2fb0e8a8b718f34; 4eb45b4e9d786abfc8f414dd0027c07864fdf1de; 485d5f2e51376dd8cd58d9a7d42693c698f73b0a; 4783368e9b0860530baaf489f94a570a35287b1e; 17d7b11eae9c5f5830697ff0c1319e3b983545a6; 1d2f64694f389da459daf5c0186f03251f63fa1b; 7ef0af7dca62331e841af0f9233fc56dc382400b; 7b9c8fc1e7e353b1aac6dd02397f91d3da576a59; 2fe4d7deb937d1c126c8981ba3a4d42871ff5ac3; 97a97c0e68e20f3cf831620cd5b3f2f0f8b54d1e; a1cc10c8aeb98aac26818bc8db7a53735cfaab98,Heredity,119,256 - 264

We sought to identify biomarkers of IV busulfan clearance using a targeted pharmacometabonomics approach. A total of 200 metabolites were quantitated in 106 plasma samples, each obtained before IV busulfan administration in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Both univariate linear regression with false discovery rate (FDR) and pathway enrichment analyses using the Global test were performed. In the univariate analysis, glycine, N-acetylglycine, 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, creatine, serine, and tyrosine were statistically significantly associated with IV busulfan clearance at P < 0.05, with the first three satisfying the FDR of q < 0.1. Using pathway enrichment analysis, the glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway was statistically significantly associated with IV busulfan clearance at P < 0.05 and q < 0.1, and a pathway impact >0.1. Glycine is a component of glutathione, which is conjugated with busulfan via glutathione transferase enzymes. These results demonstrate the potential utility of pharmacometabonomics to inform IV busulfan dosing.

We replicated previously reported linkage of TFPI plasma levels to the chromosome 2q region. The putative causal locus, rs62187992, was associated with TFPI plasma levels and thrombosis. rs62187992 was marginally associated with TFPI expression in human aortic endothelial cells. Click to hear Ann Gil's presentation on new insights into thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor SUMMARY: Background Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) regulates fibrin clot formation, and low TFPI plasma levels increase the risk of arterial thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism (VTE). TFPI plasma levels are also heritable, and a previous linkage scan implicated the chromosome 2q region, but no specific genes. Objectives To replicate the finding of the linkage region in an independent sample, and to identify the causal locus. Methods We first performed a linkage analysis of microsatellite markers and TFPI plasma levels in 251 individuals from the F5L Family Study, and replicated the finding of the linkage peak on chromosome 2q (LOD = 3.06). We next defined a follow-up region that included 112 603 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under the linkage peak, and meta-analyzed associations between these SNPs and TFPI plasma levels across the F5L Family Study and the Marseille Thrombosis Association (MARTHA) Study, a study of 1033 unrelated VTE patients. SNPs with false discovery rate q-values of < 0.10 were tested for association with TFPI plasma levels in 892 patients with coronary artery disease in the AtheroGene Study. Results and Conclusions One SNP, rs62187992, was associated with TFPI plasma levels in all three samples (Î² = + 0.14 and P = 4.23 Ã— 10-6 combined; Î² = + 0.16 and P = 0.02 in the F5L Family Study; Î² = + 0.13 and P = 6.3 Ã— 10-4 in the MARTHA Study; Î² = + 0.17 and P = 0.03 in the AtheroGene Study), and contributed to the linkage peak in the F5L Family Study. rs62187992 was also associated with clinical VTE (odds ratio 0.90, P = 0.03) in the INVENT Consortium of > 7000 cases and their controls, and was marginally associated with TFPI expression (Î² = + 0.19, P = 0.08) in human aortic endothelial cells, a primary site of TFPI synthesis.

Here we examine genome-wide DNA methylation, first in 50 identical twins discordant for heat pain sensitivity and then in 50 further unrelated individuals. Whole-blood DNA methylation was characterized at 5.2 million loci by MeDIP sequencing and assessed longitudinally to identify differentially methylated regions associated with high or low pain sensitivity (pain DMRs). Nine meta-analysis pain DMRs show robust evidence for association (false discovery rate 5%) with the strongest signal in the pain gene TRPA1 (P=1.2 Ã— 10(-13)). Several pain DMRs show longitudinal stability consistent with susceptibility effects, have similar methylation levels in the brain and altered expression in the skin.

Survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been associated with patient sex, typically with males experiencing poorer outcomes. It is unclear if this disparity is based in divergent tumor biology. We analyzed the TCGA HNSCC cohort to uncover disparities in the somatic single nucleotide variation (SNV), copy number alteration (CNA) and mRNA abundance profiles between males and females. Critically, we stratified our results by tumor HPV status to control for this significant confounder.


METHODS
SNV, CNA and mRNA abundance differences between males and females were compared separately for the HPV-positive (nÂ =Â 67) and negative (nÂ =Â 431) TCGA HNSCC cohorts. Overall survival outcomes were compared in males and females in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative subsets of patients.


RESULTS
Females were found to have poorer overall survival than males (pÂ =Â 0.048), largely due to higher rates of HPV-positive disease among men. SNV analysis revealed that in HPV-positive disease, there were no differences by sex after accounting for the false discovery rate (FDR). In HPV-negative tumors, BRWD3 mutations occurred more frequently in the tumors of female patients compared to males after adjusting for the FDR (pÂ =Â 0.02). Further, HPV-negative BRWD3 mutant tumors were found to have significantly worse 5-year overall survival compared to wildtype on multivariate analysis (pÂ =Â 0.02). There were 88 heterozygous deletions and 14 amplifications that were differentially altered between male and female HPV-negative tumors and associated with expression changes. Pathway analysis of these genes revealed that tumors from males were enriched in five pathways including chemokine and phosphophatidylinositol signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Reanalysis of the TCGA HNSCC dataset stratified by sex revealed that males in this cohort had a significant survival advantage, due to a higher proportion of HPV-positive disease. Mutations in BRWD3 were more frequent in HPV-negative tumors of females and were associated with poorer overall survival. BRWD3 may represent a novel biomarker of patient outcomes, but will require additional validation.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Neil Mundi"", ids = ""12378483""); list(name = ""Farhad Ghasemi"", ids = ""10375592""); list(name = ""Peter Y F Zeng"", ids = ""49126504""); list(name = ""Stephenie D.

1aec3ac8a6a3c83a625253fb65c07c3e9f2c3393,ADDIS: adaptive algorithms for online FDR control with conservative nulls,"Major internet companies routinely perform tens of thousands of A/B tests each year. Such large-scale sequential experimentation has resulted in a recent spurt of new algorithms that can provably control the false discovery rate (FDR) in a fully online fashion. However, current state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms can suffer from a significant loss in power if null p-values are conservative (stochastically larger than the uniform distribution), a situation that occurs frequently in practice. In this work, we introduce a new adaptive discarding method called ADDIS that provably controls the FDR and achieves the best of both worlds: it enjoys appreciable power increase over all existing methods if nulls are conservative (the practical case), and rarely loses power if nulls are exactly uniformly distributed (the ideal case). We provide several practical insights on robust choices of tuning parameters, and extend the idea to asynchronous and offline settings as well.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jinjin Tian"", ids = ""9509390""); list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942"")",c18d34ddf5d5c87d4dce3b67a24aa757fbcb8db6; 782b5102432d341384d5a58590ee1ad30bf0cbc5,be14c56689603b297e5429a8fe1ecee695cd77c7; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; a0edc4c4b5976be88275ea5834e1d3179513e821; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; a7f5ddee3d55d628eae68653dc3b34ffcd2d2075; 52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28,,,
b4cc461f08c7537a2438c16d8f967849efd1a9ca,Enhancing Pavement Surface Macrotexture Characterization,"One of the most important objectives for transportation engineers is to understand pavement surface properties and their positive and negative effects on the user. This can improve the design of the infrastructure, adequacy of tools, and consistency of methodologies that are essential for transportation practitioners regarding macrotexture characterization. Important pavement surface characteristics, or tirepavement interactions, such as friction, tire-pavement noise, splash and spray, and rolling resistance, are significantly influenced by pavement macrotexture. This dissertation compares static and dynamic macrotexture measurements and proposes and enhanced method to quantify the macrotexture. Dynamic measurements performed with vehicle-mounted lasers have the advantage of measuring macrotexture at traffic speed. One drawback of these laser devices is the presence of â€œspikesâ€ in the collected data, which impact the texture measurements. The dissertation proposes two robust and innovative methods to overcome this limitation. The first method is a data-driven adaptive method that detects and removes the spikes from high-speed laser texture measurements. The method first calculates the discrete wavelet transform of the texture measurements. It then detects (at all levels) and removes the spikes from the obtained wavelet coefficients (or differences). Finally, it calculates the inverse discrete wavelet transform with the processed wavelet coefficients (without outliers) to obtain the Mean Profile Depth (MPD) from the measurements with the spikes removed. The method was validated by comparing the results with MPD measurements obtained with a Circular Texture Meter (CTMeter) that was chosen as the control device. Although this first method was able to successfully remove the spikes, it has the drawback that it depends on manual modeling of the distribution of the wavelet coefficients to correctly define an appropriate threshold. The next step of this dissertation proposes an enhanced to the spike removal methodology for macrotexture measurements taken with high-speed laser devices. This denoising methodology uses an algorithm that defines the distribution of texture measurements by using the family of Generalized Gaussian Distributions (GGD), along with the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method that controls the proportion of wrongly identified spikes among all identified spikes. The FDR control allows for an adaptive threshold selection that differentiates between valid measurements and spikes. The validation of the method showed that the MPD results obtained with denoised dynamic measurements are comparable to MPD results from the control devices. This second method is included as a crucial step in the last stage of this dissertation as explained following. The last part of the dissertation presents an enhanced macrotexture characterization index based on the Effective Area for Water Evacuation (EAWE), which: (1) Estimates the potential of the pavement to drain water and (2) Correlates better with two pavement surface properties affected by macrotexture (friction and noise) that the current MPD method. The proposed index is defined by a three-step process that: (1) removes the spikes, assuring the reliability of the texture profile data, (2) finds the enveloping profile that is necessary to delimit the area between the tire and the pavement when contact occurs, and (3) computes the EAWE. Comparisons of current (MPD) and proposed (EAWE) macrotexture characterization indices showed that the MPD overestimates the ability of the pavement for draining the surface water under a tire.",2015,Materials Science,"list(name = ""Mogrovejo Carrasco"", ids = ""145814693""); list(name = ""Daniel Estuardo"", ids = ""98825813"")",1d7965189c392a228d33dde4110c8a1ecab9c5de,421b73240667b495d42c8256ae0cbc6ad0cc7e91; a71be1617728d3ad480b8fa2bc8af5149c194083; 30efb24ea63723cffdd59ae7ed8a17eee04848eb; b673ba03c066d053e215802c5ca4e641b1ec8afd; f84dd01c28d83c51642f2254511a241a49942086; 0ffb5031eba66acf5acfda0f2f8a3f105f9b4620; 0379ed78fa9f484d1a92e21a359435c9c0cd4e67; 9f483036f690a89ca96a3a7cc3521208387a923c; 0a4d4d1bbdad2d760f5aeec23c505d7d5fcd177a,,,
95599d49087ec44fcf9ccc60a318a25646eaea8c,Generalized Tensor-Based Morphometry of HIV/AIDS Using Multivariate Statistics on Deformation Tensors,"This paper investigates the performance of a new multivariate method for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). Statistics on Riemannian manifolds are developed that exploit the full information in deformation tensor fields. In TBM, multiple brain images are warped to a common neuroanatomical template via 3-D nonlinear registration; the resulting deformation fields are analyzed statistically to identify group differences in anatomy. Rather than study the Jacobian determinant (volume expansion factor) of these deformations, as is common, we retain the full deformation tensors and apply a manifold version of Hotelling's test to them, in a Log-Euclidean domain. In 2-D and 3-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 26 HIV/AIDS patients and 14 matched healthy subjects, we compared multivariate tensor analysis versus univariate tests of simpler tensor-derived indices: the Jacobian determinant, the trace, geodesic anisotropy, and eigenvalues of the deformation tensor, and the angle of rotation of its eigenvectors. We detected consistent, but more extensive patterns of structural abnormalities, with multivariate tests on the full tensor manifold. Their improved power was established by analyzing cumulative-value plots using false discovery rate (FDR) methods, appropriately controlling for false positives. This increased detection sensitivity may empower drug trials and large-scale studies of disease that use tensor-based morphometry.",2008,Medicine; Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Natasha Lepore"", ids = ""1702792""); list(name = ""Caroline C.

d70b1226c35f02d510469437a08cc30d52af95d0,Population Genomic Analysis of the Blue Crab Callinectes sapidus Using Genotyping-By-Sequencing,"ABSTRACT Previous genetic studies of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts have reported weak or temporally variable spatial structure, suggesting high gene flow among distant populations possibly facilitated by long-distance larval dispersal or other features of blue crab life history. The use of relatively few genetic markers, however, may have limited power to detect subtle but significant structure that could inform fisheries management. In this study, the potential for genome-scale datasets to uncover subtle patterns of population structure in the blue crab was examined using a high-throughput genotyping approach (genotyping-by-sequencing) that generated data for more than 9,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in crabs from three populations: Panama City Beach, FL, Agawam River, MA, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Principle components analyses among the three populations revealed very distinct clustering of the Brazilian samples from U.S. populations, likely reflecting restricted gene flow across the equator. Detailed analysis of population structure between the two U.S. populations revealed low but significant genetic differentiation (FST = 0.0103), with FST values ranging from -0.05 to 0.48. Previous studies have failed to detect significant genetic structure on a similar geographic scale. FST outlier analysis identified 242 loci (2.45% of total) with statistically extreme values at the false discovery rate Î± = 0.05 level, only 16 of which showed significant sequence homology to annotated proteins via BLASTx alignment. Top BLASTx hits were to crustacean or arthropod sequences and 8 of the 16 had high sequence similarity to transposable elements or related machinery. Finally, results of population assignment tests for the two U.S. populations showed that the full marker dataset provided good power to assign individuals back to their population of origin (âˆ¼83% and 92% success for Panama City Beach and Agawam River, respectively), which dropped significantly when using only 500 randomly selected SNPs (âˆ¼61% and 72% success). Overall, this study demonstrates the great utility of high-throughput sequencing technologies for characterizing fine-scale patterns of genetic structure in blue crabs, and this approach should substantially improve the delineation of stock structure and further advance our understanding of blue crab population connectivity and ecology.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Louis V Plough"", ids = ""5880512"")",1f70c5a6c635ed5d96dfddee94e023715c8bffc1,6101198d32a80ec5d835dbd761058b424f4461e3; ebcb0a6af6b9cc11c09d71dc879b521dfc8f5b9a; 78ceb4a6d32b37e02e812d8fa24b0404779229eb; 20c32918907c3ac2f31c34a080c83d5879094f56; bb2a8c6df844e448732deb226b33e45c8e6648b1; f8a42b5d4c5528ebbc93a773bab4518cb384ee28; 5c1a0e346ee94442dcb27d80bdeae5edce3a1ee5; b9bdb22502bcb4bc33d87da7d430927ed2183f8b; 5168be8a2d0322b950d6aa2c854bc9d2aee0459d; c79f7ea0eb6842737293ab089502b34236c08a9b; 5b4102e38218fcb40f0e3203aec69e3517c824ab; e49943bdcf115d67e9d220ef523906ef58c3ca39; 8ce5673cb2960b09143408fa46736294709af7de; f717d659b5f7c842db094c48f76ac46614e2e522; e986b11633f38ad3ccdb74a8011d3b75d304b33a; 350ae39eba65953b6d67252eb8acb773337c6753; bc9bbb00dba908d937894db496c3f3b00be38600; 3c20653fc82b5847cc8ab4009f11009c09d9b190; 1a4bd3c8e8d624c356b18efa6dc6650a45d2f8d2; 2bbeffe7fcb4fc6f6d01e56cf63739566ba7991b; cc6ad46cf1d8c895c62dc0a936ae3b8c9ab59183; 40741f0c70b1685e0acc2fb9406a672880b50c00,Journal of Shellfish Research,36,249 - 261

However, it is difficult to control the false positive rate, especially under small sample size. Traditional family-wise error rate or false discovery rate adjusts the p values based on the distribution or ranks of p value in the same multiple testing. In this paper, we investigated the performance of integrating the Data-space boundary-based test (BBT) and Statistics-space BBT to control the false positive rate, under a previous proposed framework called Integrative Hypothesis Tests (IHT). The classification accuracy rate by Data-space BBT provides valuable information complementary to the p value from Statistics-space BBT. The simulation results demonstrated that the integration effectively controls the false positive rate even for small-sample-size cases. Experiments on the real-world dataset of bipolar disorder also validated the effectiveness of the integration.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jin-Xiong Lv"", ids = ""8785866""); list(name = ""Shikui Tu"", ids = ""1701972"")",,,,,628-638

Bead arrays are becoming a popular platform for high-throughput expression arrays. However, the number of the beads targeting a transcript and the variation of their intensities differ from sample to sample in these arrays. This property results in different accuracy of expression intensities of a transcript across arrays.


RESULTS
We provide evidence, with publicly available spike-in data, that the false discovery rate of differential expression is reduced by modeling bead-level variability with a multi-level mixed effects model. We compare the performance of our proposed model to existing analysis methods for bead arrays: the unweighted t-test and other weighted methods. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights into when the multi-level mixed effects model outperforms other methods. Finally, we provide a software program for differential expression analysis using the multi-level mixed effects model that analyzes tens of thousands of genes efficiently.

08939fc026c1efcddeca0e9af4de53e116478deb,"AdaFDR: a Fast, Powerful and Covariate-Adaptive Approach to Multiple Hypothesis Testing","Multiple hypothesis testing is an essential component of modern data science. Its goal is to maximize the number of discoveries while controlling the fraction of false discoveries. In many settings, in addition to the p-value, additional information/covariates for each hypothesis are available. For example, in eQTL studies, each hypothesis tests the correlation between a variant and the expression of a gene. We also have additional covariates such as the location, conservation and chromatin status of the variant, which could inform how likely the association is to be due to noise. However, popular multiple hypothesis testing approaches, such as Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BH) and independent hypothesis weighting (IHW), either ignore these covariates or assume the covariate to be univariate. We introduce AdaFDR, a fast and flexible method that adaptively learns the optimal p-value threshold from covariates to significantly improve detection power. On eQTL analysis of the GTEx data, AdaFDR discovers 32% and 27% more associations than BH and IHW, respectively, at the same false discovery rate. We prove that AdaFDR controls false discovery proportion, and show that it makes substantially more discoveries while controlling FDR in extensive experiments. AdaFDR is computationally efficient and can process more than 100 million hypotheses within an hour and allows multi-dimensional covariates with both numeric and categorical values. It also provides exploratory plots for the user to interpret how each covariate affects the significance of hypotheses, making it broadly useful across many applications.",2019,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Martin J.

01b83baf9fa233d03cf845ae854f67da66150b26,Pathway Analysis for Genome-Wide Association Study of Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Skin,"BACKGROUND
Recently, a pathway-based approach has been developed to evaluate the cumulative contribution of the functionally related genes for genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which may help utilize GWAS data to a greater extent.


METHODS
In this study, we applied this approach for the GWAS of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin. We first conducted the BCC GWAS among 1,797 BCC cases and 5,197 controls in Caucasians with 740,760 genotyped SNPs. 115,688 SNPs were grouped into gene transcripts within 20 kb in distance and then into 174 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, 205 BioCarta pathways, as well as two positive control gene sets (pigmentation gene set and BCC risk gene set). The association of each pathway with BCC risk was evaluated using the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. One thousand permutations were conducted to assess the significance.


RESULTS
Both of the positive control gene sets reached pathway p-values<0.05. Four other pathways were also significantly associated with BCC risk: the heparan sulfate biosynthesis pathway (p â€Š=â€Š 0.007, false discovery rate, FDR â€Š=â€Š 0.35), the mCalpain pathway (p â€Š=â€Š 0.002, FDR â€Š=â€Š 0.12), the Rho cell motility signaling pathway (p â€Š=â€Š 0.011, FDR â€Š=â€Š 0.30), and the nitric oxide pathway (p â€Š=â€Š 0.022, FDR â€Š=â€Š 0.42).

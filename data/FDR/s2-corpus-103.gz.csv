ce47e00fa900bdadf1b49dc6dd670bbc19a0a87b,Urinary Metabolites Associated with Blood Pressure on a Low- or High-Sodium Diet,"Dietary salt intake has significant effects on arterial blood pressure and the development of hypertension. Mechanisms underlying salt-dependent changes in blood pressure remain poorly understood, and it is difficult to assess blood pressure salt-sensitivity clinically. Methods: We examined urinary levels of metabolites in 103 participants of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Sodium trial after nearly 30 days on a defined diet containing high sodium (targeting 150 mmol sodium intake per day) or low sodium (50 mmol per day). Targeted chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis was performed in 24 h urine samples for 47 amino metabolites and 10 metabolites related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The effect of an identified metabolite on blood pressure was examined in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Results: Urinary metabolite levels improved the prediction of classification of blood pressure salt-sensitivity based on race, age and sex. Random forest and generalized linear mixed model analyses identified significant (false discovery rate <0.05) associations of 24 h excretions of Î²-aminoisobutyric acid, cystine, citrulline, homocysteine and lysine with systolic blood pressure and cystine with diastolic blood pressure. The differences in homocysteine levels between low- and high-sodium intakes were significantly associated with the differences in diastolic blood pressure. These associations were significant with or without considering demographic factors. Treatment with Î²-aminoisobutyric acid significantly attenuated high-salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Conclusion: These findings support the presence of new mechanisms of blood pressure regulation involving metabolic intermediaries, which could be developed as markers or therapeutic targets for salt-sensitive hypertension.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuan Cheng"", ids = ""145591949""); list(name = ""Haiying Song"", ids = ""3228025""); list(name = ""Xiaoqing Pan"", ids = ""48931330""); list(name = ""Hong Xue"", ids = ""144653480""); list(name = ""Yifei Wan"", ids = ""47480164""); list(name = ""Tao Wang"", ids = ""36897285""); list(name = ""Zhongmin Tian"", ids = ""34121066""); list(name = ""Entai Hou"", ids = ""32568328""); list(name = ""Ian R Lanza"", ids = ""4808360""); list(name = ""Pengyuan Liu"", ids = ""39119888""); list(name = ""Yong Liu"", ids = ""47908636""); list(name = ""Purushottam W.

da21f87545c79dc1b5abbfc6d5679de2d7446ff4,GlycopeptideGraphMS: Improved Glycopeptide Detection and Identification by Exploiting Graph Theoretical Patterns in Mass and Retention Time.,"The leading proteomic method for identifying N-glycosylated peptides is liquid chromatography coupled with tandem fragmentation mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) followed by spectral matching of MS/MS fragment masses to a database of possible glycan and peptide combinations. Such database-dependent approaches come with challenges such as needing high-quality informative MS/MS spectra, ignoring unexpected glycan or peptide sequences, and making incorrect assignments because some glycan combinations are equivalent in mass to amino acids. To address these challenges, we present GlycopeptideGraphMS, a graph theoretical bioinformatic approach complementary to the database-dependent method. Using the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) as a model glycoprotein with multiple N-glycosylation sites, we show that those LCMS features that could be grouped into graph networks on the basis of glycan mass and retention time differences were actually N-glycopeptides with the same peptide backbone but different N-glycan compositions. Conversely, unglycosylated peptides did not exhibit this grouping behavior. Furthermore, MS/MS sequencing of the glycan and peptide composition of just one N-glycopeptide in the graph was sufficient to identify the rest of the N-glycopeptides in the graph. By validating the identifications with exoglycosidase cocktails and MS/MS fragmentation, we determined the experimental false discovery rate of identifications to be 2.21%. GlycopeptideGraphMS detected more than 500 unique N-glycopeptides from AXL, triple the number found by a database search with Byonic software, and detected incorrect assignments due to a nonspecific protease cleavage. This method overcomes some limitations of the database approach and is a step closer to comprehensive automated glycoproteomics.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew S Choo"", ids = ""144120877""); list(name = ""Corrine Wan"", ids = ""38542737""); list(name = ""Pauline M.

7f8176df2335ca875525a4393a1e9eea35e59a93,Brain Gene Expression in a Novel Mouse Model of Postpartum Mood Disorder,"Abstract Background Steroid sulfatase (STS) cleaves sulfate groups from steroid hormones; its expression/activity increases in late pregnancy and into the postpartum period. STS-deficient human and mouse mothers display elevated psychopathology and abnormal behaviour respectively; in mice, these effects can be partially normalised by antipsychotic (ziprasidone) administration. Methodology We compared brain gene expression in new mouse mothers administered the STS inhibitor 667-Coumate, or vehicle; significant changes were followed-up with pathway analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Finally, the effects of combined 667-Coumate and ziprasidone administration on expression of the most robustly differentially-expressed genes were examined. Results Surprisingly, no between-group gene expression changes were detected at a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected p<0.1. 1,081 unique expression changes were detected at p<0.05, two top hits were verified by qPCR, and pathway analysis indicated enrichment of genes involved in olfactory transduction. The expression of Stoml3 and Cyp2g1 was unaffected by ziprasidone administration. Conclusions Postpartum behavioural abnormalities in STS-deficient mothers are likely to be the culmination of many small gene expression changes. Our data are consistent with the idea that olfactory function is key to maternal behaviour in mice, and suggest that aberrant expression of olfactory system genes may underlie abnormal maternal behaviour in STS-deficient women.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Trevor Humby"", ids = ""6635489""); list(name = ""William D.

4123de9dd3dd3a6bc36e49606d9904039d80925e,Identification of metastasis-suppressive microRNAs in primary melanoma.,"BACKGROUND
Surgical management of primary melanoma is curative for most patients with clinically localized disease at diagnosis; however, a substantial number of patients recur and progress to advanced disease. Understanding molecular alterations that influence differential tumor progression of histopathologically similar lesions may lead to improved prognosis and therapies to slow or prevent metastasis.


METHODS
We examined microRNA dysregulation by expression profiling of primary melanoma tumors from 92 patients. We screened candidate microRNAs selected by differential expression between recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors or associated with primary tumor thickness (Student's t test, Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate [FDR] < 0.05), in in vitro invasion assays. We performed in vivo metastasis assays, matrix remodeling experiments, and molecular studies to identify metastasis-regulating microRNAs and their cellular and molecular mechanisms. All statistical tests were two-sided.


RESULTS
We identified two microRNAs (hsa-miR-382, hsa-miR-516b) whose expression was lower in aggressive vs nonaggressive primary tumors, which suppressed invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo (mean metastatic foci: control: 37.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.6 to 50.2; miR-382: 19.5, 95% CI = 12.2 to 26.9, P = .009; miR-516b: 12.5, 95% CI = 7.7 to 17.4, P < .001, Student's t test). Mechanistically, miR-382 overexpression inhibits extracellular matrix degradation by melanoma cells. Moreover, we identified actin regulators CTTN, RAC1, and ARPC2 as direct targets of miR-382. Depletion of CTTN partially recapitulates miR-382 effects on matrix remodeling, invasion, and metastasis. Inhibition of miR-382 in a weakly tumorigenic melanoma cell line increased tumor progression and metastasis in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS
Aberrant expression of specific microRNAs that can functionally impact progression of primary melanoma occurs as an early event of melanomagenesis.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Doug Hanniford"", ids = ""123672938""); list(name = ""Miguel F.

2f9de6778d2d8b45ea105af7e5df395230ba7c48,VEGFA and VEGFR2 gene polymorphisms and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy: comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatments trials (CATT).,"IMPORTANCE
Individual variation in response and duration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is seen among patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Identification of genetic markers that affect clinical response may result in optimization of anti-VEGF therapy.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the pharmacogenetic relationship between genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VEGF signaling pathway and response to treatment with ranibizumab or bevacizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
In total, 835 of 1149 patients (72.7%) participating in the Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT) at 43 CATT clinical centers.


INTERVENTION
Each patient was genotyped for 7 SNPs in VEGFA (rs699946, rs699947, rs833069, rs833070, rs1413711, rs2010963, and rs2146323) and 1 SNP in VEGFR2 (rs2071559) using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Genotypic frequencies were compared with clinical measures of response to therapy at 1 year, including the mean visual acuity, mean change in visual acuity, at least a 15-letter increase, retinal thickness, mean change in total foveal thickness, presence of fluid on optical coherence tomography, presence of leakage on fluorescein angiography, mean change in lesion size, and mean number of injections administered. Differences in response by genotype were evaluated with tests of linear trend calculated from logistic regression models for categorical outcomes and linear regression models for continuous outcomes. The method of controlling the false discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
For each of the measures of visual acuity evaluated, no association was observed with any of the genotypes or with the number of risk alleles. Four VEGFA SNPs demonstrated an association with retinal thickness: rs699947 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.03), rs833070 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.04), rs1413711 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.045), and rs2146323 (Pâ€‰=â€‰.006). However, adjusted P values for these associations were all statistically nonsignificant (range, Pâ€‰=â€‰.24 to Pâ€‰=â€‰.45). Among the participants in 2 as-needed groups, no association was found in the number of injections among the different genotypes or for the total number of risk alleles. The effect of risk alleles on each clinical measure did not differ by treatment group, drug, or dosing regimen (Pâ€‰>â€‰.01 for all).


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
This study provides evidence that no pharmacogenetic associations exist between the studied VEGFA and VEGFR2 SNPs and response to anti-VEGF therapy.

c0af0e87f110d7d8ef4cd7790eaef7364348013f,Controlling the False Discovery Rate in Two-Stage Combination Tests for Multiple Endpoints,"We consider the problem of simultaneous testing of null hypotheses associated with multiple endpoints in the setting of a two-stage adaptive design where the hypotheses are sequentially screened at the flrst stage as being rejected or accepted based on boundaries on the false discovery rate (FDR) and the remaining null hypotheses are tested at the second stage having combined their p-values from the two stages through some combination function. We propose two procedures to control the false discovery rate (FDR), extending the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and its adaptive version incorporating an estimate of the number of true nulls from single-stage to two-stage setting. These procedures are theoretically proved to control the FDR under the assumption that the pairs of flrst- and second-stage p-values are independent and those corresponding to the null hypotheses are identically distributed as a pair (p1;p2) satisfying the p-clud property of Brannath et al. (2002). We consider two types of combination function, Fisherâ€™s and Simesâ€™, and present explicit formulas involving these functions",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

Methods: To identify the effect of common genetic variants on gene expression that might explain the mechanisms linking genome-wide association loci with AF risk, we performed RNA sequencing of left atrial appendages from a biracial cohort of 265 subjects. Results: Combining gene expression data with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data, we found that approximately two-thirds of the expressed genes were regulated in cis by common genetic variants at a false discovery rate of <0.05, defined as cis-expression quantitative trait loci. Twelve of 23 reported AF genome-wide association loci displayed genome-wide significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci, at PRRX1 (chromosome 1q24), SNRNP27 (1q24), CEP68 (2p14), FKBP7 (2q31), KCNN2 (5q22), FAM13B (5q31), CAV1 (7q31), ASAH1 (8p22), MYOZ1 (10q22), C11ORF45 (11q24), TBX5 (12q24), and SYNE2 (14q23), suggesting that altered expression of these genes plays a role in AF susceptibility. Allelic expression imbalance was used as an independent method to characterize the cis-control of gene expression. One thousand two hundred forty-eight of 5153 queried genes had cis-single nucleotide polymorphisms that significantly regulated allelic expression at a false discovery rate of <0.05. Conclusions: We provide a genome-wide catalog of the genetic control of gene expression in human left atrial appendage. These data can be used to confirm the relevance of genome-wide association loci and to direct future functional studies to identify the genes and genetic variants responsible for complex diseases such as AF.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey Hsu"", ids = ""48829169""); list(name = ""Shamone R.

1aac1c7794b8552af2516a43539ada83aa061444,Common Variants for Cardiovascular Disease: Clinical Utility Confirmed,"Article, see p 2091 

The increase in sample size of genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses has led to the identification now of >150 common variants/single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are robustly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD), or CVD traits such as coronary calcification (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). For example, in 2013, the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium, with 63â€‰746 cases with coronary artery disease and 130â€‰681 controls,1 identified 15 novel loci, taking the number of statistically robust CVD SNPs to 46, with a further 104 SNPs associated with CVD at a 5% false discovery rate. Together, these variants explained â‰ˆ10.6% of CVD heritability. Many of these loci identified are known to be involved in lipid metabolism,2 as would be expected from our knowledge of the importance of dyslipidemia in the development of CVD, with 12 of 46 CARDIoGRAMplusC4D SNPs showing a significant association with a lipid trait.

These SNPs, located throughout the human genome, are common (frequency >5% for all), with the odds ratio for disease ranging from â‰ˆ30% higher risk for carriers of top-ranking GWAS risk variants at the chromosome 9p CDKN2A/2B locus to only 7% to 8% higher risk for carriers of SNPs at the loci for PCSK9 (chromosome 2) or for HNF1A (chromosome 12). Because all of these odds ratios are modest, questions arise as to what the potential clinical utility of these SNPs is and how we can use these genetic tools to explore the inherited contribution to CVD.

Given the relatively small effect sizes associated with these risk loci, it is unsurprising that the addition of 1 variant into a classic risk factor (CRF) risk score does not result in improved predictive ability.3 This has led to the development of so-called genetic risk scores (GRSs) for which SNPs at independent loci are combined.

d1a0f3e824234507db120594b6764cab0a369837,MistNet: Measuring historical bird migration in the US using archived weather radar data and convolutional neural networks,"1. Large networks of weather radars are comprehensive instruments for studying bird migration. For example, the US WSR-88D network covers the entire continental US and has archived data since the 1990s. The data can quantify both broad and fine-scale bird movements to address a range of migration ecology questions. However, the problem of automatically discriminating precipitation from biology has significantly limited the ability to conduct biological analyses with historical radar data. 2. We develop MistNet, a deep convolutional neural network to discriminate precipitation from biology in radar scans. Unlike prior machine learning approaches, MistNet makes fine-scaled predictions and can collect biological information from radar scans that also contain precipitation. MistNet is based on neural networks for images, and includes several architecture components tailored to the unique characteristics of radar data. To avoid a massive human labeling effort, we train MistNet using abundant noisy labels obtained from dual polarization radar data. 3. In historical and contemporary WSR-88D data, MistNet identifies at least 95.9% of all biomass with a false discovery rate of 1.3%. Dual polarization training data and our radar-specific architecture components are effective. By retaining biomass that co-occurs with precipitation in a single radar scan, MistNet retains 15% more biomass than traditional whole-scan approaches to screening. MistNet is fully automated and can be applied to data sets of millions of radar scans to produce fine-grained predictions that enable a range of applications, from continent-scale mapping to local analysis of airspace usage. 4. Radar ornithology is advancing rapidly and leading to significant discoveries about continent-scale patterns of bird movements. General-purpose and empirically validated methods to quantify biological signals in radar data are essential to the future development of this field.

This study examined association between obesity and DNA methylation in non-Hispanic Black and White women diagnosed with breast cancer. Genome-wide DNA methylation was measured in the breast cancer tumor tissue of 96 women using the EPIC array. To examine the association between obesity and tumor methylation, linear regression models were usedâ€”regressing methylation Î² value for each cytosine and guanine (CpG) site on body mass index adjusting for covariates. Significance was set at false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05. In the top 20 CpG sites, we explored the interactions with race and estrogen receptor (ER) status. We used multivariable Cox-proportional hazard models to examine whether methylation in the top 20 sites was associated with all-cause mortality. While none of the CpG sites passed the FDR threshold for significance, among the top 20 CpG sites, we observed interactions with race (TOMM20) and ER status (PSMB1, QSOX1 and PHF1). The same CpG sites in TOMM20, PSMB1, and QSOX1 were associated with all-cause mortality. We identified novel interactions between obesity-associated methylation and both race and ER status in genes that have been associated with tumor regulation. Our data suggest that dysregulation in two sites may associate with all-cause mortality.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Whitney L. Do"", ids = ""1602548635""); list(name = ""Karen N.

In moderate and large experiments, the large number of potential effects presents problems of multiple statistical inference. In this work we apply the false discovery rate (FDR) idea in multiple inference to effect identification in factorial experiments. The FDR is the expected proportion of inert effects among those declared active, which we believe is a more relevant quantity to control than the probability of a single erroneous declaration, the criterion that has been adopted in previous studies. We show how to combine the control of FDR with popular methods for estimating contrast standard error in unreplicated experiments. We present simulations of unreplicated 16- and 32-run experiments that illustrate the improvements in power that can be obtained by controlling the FDR.

One critical task in analyzing genome-wide datasets is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) so that the proportion of false positive features among those called significant is restrained. Recently a number of FDR control methods have been proposed and widely practiced, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg approach, the Storey approach and Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM).MethodsThis paper presents a straight-forward yet powerful FDR control method termed miFDR, which aims to minimize FDR when calling a fixed number of significant features. We theoretically proved that the strategy used by miFDR is able to find the optimal number of significant features when the desired FDR is fixed.ResultsWe compared miFDR with the BH approach, the Storey approach and SAM on both simulated datasets and public DNA microarray datasets. The results demonstrated that miFDR outperforms others by identifying more significant features under the same FDR cut-offs. Literature search showed that many genes called only by miFDR are indeed relevant to the underlying biology of interest.ConclusionsFDR has been widely applied to analyzing high-throughput datasets allowed for rapid discoveries. Under the same FDR threshold, miFDR is capable to identify more significant features than its competitors at a compatible level of complexity. Therefore, it can potentially generate great impacts on biological and biomedical research.AvailabilityIf interested, please contact the authors for getting miFDR.",2013,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuanzhe Bei"", ids = ""2841309""); list(name = ""Pengyu Hong"", ids = ""145595134"")",40ca6f603c0f7f622cdf2ebb17bf148532cec6a2; 71e8e17f265ee74c1f9b95c21ee7d6b5bd1a4791,bb834784b8e1193da01534d8b839c4093aed5000; da4ba321985946a57d552b8226ff6209f5583aa0; 550d6bba75c4133bc5b25c72804daa8a6ad2b47b; b7b604cd36e96505a81d29ba0e281781ba9dda32; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 40ca6f603c0f7f622cdf2ebb17bf148532cec6a2; 44c6c52783fb8468471f6e433bc47834cb99aa26; bc0448dfd5f67852b4ecad61c80728470de18273; 66909ab8fc439cce892a7e33baf5cd29b2388898; 542768d44df1a7c483f220ae955fcff77dc47df8; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; a39c355fbee16ca8e156fa28fa71cdc592d8d6e4; 71a89a5e387265dbe73714b9c5ef9b6f0e499fb2; 0b41e2b06e760c8f62fd007d5bf0dad4897a9c00; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9c1f44f31e09c1208f06f5482b068dfe00ad2481; 76d34459d9986373273b1f32e053b23b15f440e5; afc3ccd5d3cc3694576c42c85366da74017afbbf; c532580381e5b99eb90679a67f918e4e04ad3ae1; 241d0c343804fb3fe2ec51d044063d7057962d5c; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; da6fd9a7cab0cca3484cca0542d034040ac1efac; 657c698b1239516c912398b10ca8b4d3ed014ad3; d97e61c6b1d93e9c8dcce95c28ec3662fa44a46c; 67fe35fc83079549f11f53a53d0ac9be6cf59c77; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; 857d4be25c69ee9919af1305b23773257bf993c9; 1a29223149f87b3fd8a656cf60cd4b67a2ba05d4; 66e90ae6df2b98d68ba310f32619459f853652e1; 3b7686cd381ac37be3fd004cb73493b2607fe772; ec7abb6b9c65b4a163b8dd1b8d969b83b18f30cb; aa18c56365e2f004febd3d0fa655119d3b299aae; 0d857798a09aa5d9bcfe87a67bbfb13358db81b9; b7c3db98c008058d5f4990607028d2a874f357fa; cbb6da2b094c2d4ca2c0d7aa8bb7ffda115a4db8; a8fb8a8b2779ef0fb95af888672e5f2f0ce665a8; 01cd1182a27f503a5935f9f2deb17dc1c8d65856; 631c251299edf53b70ff470677215a13d100a987; ff77db86b74bdfe2ce9371fd4410139c5e5973e5; 59d823fc9877f8d448ac4c2d90e38051026e3201; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; bdb9e105b711d56c8307acf4ee83cb29a1e675e6; 82ecb582d32cdb78fbe883e9630364220388dc65; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 34704db767565d5c0744ce5212a5c02c257a01c8; f1c180a58b0eedab77c04b38f76bd3fab84b5b57; 4c44e59114dda96c7c9ea3a837f251a39df831dc; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44,BMC Systems Biology,7,S1 - S1

Estimates of statistical confidence in lipid identification are essential for downstream data interpretation in a biological context. In the related field of proteomics, a variety of methods for estimating false-discovery are available, and understanding the statistical confidence of identifications is typically required for data analysis and hypothesis testing. However, there is no current method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) or statistical confidence for MS-based lipid identifications. This has slowed the adoption of MS-based lipidomics research, as all identifications require manual inspection and validation to ensure their accuracy. We present here the first generalizable method for FDR estimation, a target/decoy approach, that allows those conducting MS-based lipidomics research to confidently adjust spectral score thresholds to minimize false discovery and to enable full automation of data analysis.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Grant M.

To elucidate roles of miRNA in bovine muscle type specification and maintenance, we sought to determine differentially expressed miRNA between semitendinosus (STD) and masseter (MS) muscles from 3 Japanese black cattle by massively parallel sequencing. Differential gene expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms confirmed that STD and MS were MyHC-2x- and MyHC-1-abundant muscles, respectively. In total, 192 known miRNA and 20 potential new bovine miRNA were obtained from the sequencing. The differentially expressed miRNA with more than 2-fold difference in each muscle were identified. In particular, miR-196a and miR-885 were exclusively expressed in STD muscle, which was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (P=0.045 and P<0.001, respectively), whereas a slow type-directing miR-208b was highly expressed in MS compared with STD (false discovery rate<0.05). In addition, 16 potential novel miRNA were mapped and confirmed for their precursor structures by computational analyses. The results of functional annotation combined with in silico target analysis showed that the predicted target genes of miR-196a/b and miR-885 enriched gene ontology (GO) terms related to skeletal system development and regulation of transcription, respectively. Moreover, GO terms enriched from predicted targets miRNA suggested that STD-abundant- and MS-abundant-miRNA were associated with embryonic body planning and organ/tissue pattern formation, respectively. The present results revealed that the differentially expressed miRNA between the STD and MS muscles may play key roles to determine muscle type-specific tissue formation and maintenance in cattle thorough attenuating putative target genes involved in different developmental events.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Susumu Muroya"", ids = ""4318412""); list(name = ""Misako Taniguchi"", ids = ""49209865""); list(name = ""Masaki Shibata"", ids = ""47714995""); list(name = ""Mika Oe"", ids = ""40106692""); list(name = ""Koichi Ojima"", ids = ""20773517""); list(name = ""Ikuyo Nakajima"", ids = ""39594235""); list(name = ""Koichi Chikuni"", ids = ""5195864"")",d083234dbd8246931b40ab388faee2b436480072; e1461bc8c84874cd289805c98cffd590b69dc298; 620f7e77226853c6a5226959e472182a6504af9e; 94880227ffb1b5ed430c68aa0ca5f399762a7129; 31d0a44bebea556c99e56df8f91de546e2ea569c; 0435392ce61625db90dde054f6fe5e80b980c2ab; 2ca9f05ce21d0d831ea2812127bc0d4a56803cdb; 878761a6a050df75f18112b11c612cbea821e3f1; 2e814c5b3b2c5fb605bf8334f22f6458b4370b2b; 18129bca212388f6a877830c6ab48b87dfe8f05c; a2e809c9489f0b9e3bbefe2a1ae47afbc05d617f; a7de21e887eb5650b14dd4d0f7a9f7136ca80be9; 00f978162c28e1649e56336532d174fddca15b0a; 26cd01d2629b24c4460aa8b643c88f01064b312e; d22e4c4968fee671e0b025b9a3773196e8906474; 518ceff86314077727687c847a27cc07aad552af; 86ac72ff5881dfe4937720f09e34d669e6e806d9; b3c5a8434f934baa81eb68c9df9a0cfb43b73ed4; fbed6a4a618948e66fb4e15076e15a5659ddfa8c; 2bd50b0afb81f8750de42dcf35a2cfc6b370d730; 5808b9079db3bccf9385f689f3951994d0b7318a; c0d16e103cbe12bb6383370015a1a27f16060ff6; 0a7d2130e419e0ae06cc73b2e2bb298eab580d8b; 8c4f88b39463d43ee1684bf46f034fa048395645; ca139374afd1f8594447435ac18cd7498f4ffabc; 93ef7340203255a20660c7c3f602bacb64bbf65b,,Journal of animal science,91 1,"

767c581ce3d9175ae773cebb5cc2ead452c2ae87,Genetic risk for metabolic syndrome: examination of candidate gene polymorphisms related to lipid metabolism in Japanese people.,"BACKGROUND
The aetiology of metabolic syndrome is complex, being determined by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to identify genetic polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to metabolic syndrome, to allow prediction of genetic risk for this condition.


METHODS
The study population comprised 2417 unrelated Japanese subjects (1522 with metabolic syndrome and 895 controls). The genotypes for 44 polymorphisms of 31 candidate genes related to lipid metabolism were determined using a combination of PCR and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology.


RESULTS
The chi(2) test and subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex and smoking status found that the-3A-->G and 553G-->T (Gly185Cys) polymorphisms of APOA5, the 2052T-->C (Val653Val) and 1866C-->T (Asn591Asn) polymorphisms of LDLR, the 13989A-->G (Ile118Val) polymorphism of CYP3A4 and the 1014T-->A polymorphism of C1QTNF5 were significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, with the variant alleles of APOA5 and C1QTNF5 representing risk factors for and those of LDLR and CYP3A4 being protective against this condition. Serum levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol differed significantly (p<0.05) among APOA5 genotypes; the serum level of HDL cholesterol differed among LDLR genotypes; and the fasting plasma glucose level and body mass index differed between CYP3A4 and C1QTNF5 genotypes, respectively.

a055abf1daef8dfc475f396e1b7bae9d57dd3b07,Strategies in adjusting for multiple comparisons: A primer for pediatric surgeons.,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE
In pediatric surgery research, the issue of multiple comparisons commonly arises when there are multiple patient or experimental groups being compared two at a time on an outcome of interest. Performing multiple statistical comparisons increases the likelihood of finding a false positive result when there truly are no statistically significant group differences (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true). In order to control for the risk of false positive results, there are several statistical approaches that surgeons should consider in collaboration with a biostatistician when performing a study that is prone to the issue of false discovery related to multiple comparisons. It is becoming increasingly more common for high impact journals to require authors to carefully consider multiplicity in their studies. Therefore, the objective of this primer is to provide surgeons with a useful guide and recommendations on how to go about taking multiple comparisons into account to keep false positive results at an acceptable level.


METHODS
We provide background on the issue of multiple comparisons and risk of type I error and guidance on statistical approaches (i.e. multiple comparisons procedures) that can be implemented to control the type I false positive error rate based on the statistical analysis plan. These include, but are not limited to, the Bonferroni correction, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach, Tukey's procedure, ScheffÃ©'s procedure, Holm's procedure, and Dunnett's procedure.


RESULTS
We present the results of the various approaches following one-way analysis of the variance (ANOVA) using a hypothetical surgical research example of the comparison between three experimental groups of rats on skin defect coverage for experimental spina bifida: the TRASCET group, sham control, and saline control. The ultimate decision in accounting for multiple comparisons is situation-dependent and surgeons should work with their statistical colleagues to ensure the best approach for controlling the type I error rate and interpreting the evidence when making multiple inferences and comparisons.


CONCLUSIONS
The risk of rejecting the null hypothesis increases when multiple hypotheses are tested using the same data. Surgeons should be aware of the available approaches and considerations to take into account multiplicity in the statistical plan or protocol of their clinical and basic science research studies. This strategy will improve their study design and ensure the most appropriate analysis of their data. Not adjusting for multiple comparisons can lead to misleading presentation of evidence to the surgical research community because of exaggerating treatment differences or effects.

ac2c0d2df9e88ef4ee1fe3e7aacbb588fa4a6fc4,ET-Lasso: Efficient Tuning of Lasso for High-Dimensional Data,"The L1 regularization (Lasso) has proven to be a versatile tool to select relevant features and estimate the model coefficients simultaneously. Despite its popularity, it is very challenging to guarantee the feature selection consistency of Lasso. One way to improve the feature selection consistency is to select an ideal tuning parameter. Traditional tuning criteria mainly focus on minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross-validation and BIC, which may either be time-consuming or fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when the number of features is extremely large. The other way is to introduce pseudo-features to learn the importance of the original ones. Recently, the Knockoff filter is proposed to control the FDR when performing feature selection. However, its performance is sensitive to the choice of the expected FDR threshold. Motivated by these ideas, we propose a new method using pseudo-features to obtain an ideal tuning parameter. In particular, we present the Efficient Tuning of Lasso (ET-Lasso) to separate active and inactive features by adding permuted features as pseudo-features in linear models. The pseudo-features are constructed to be inactive by nature, which can be used to obtain a cutoff to select the tuning parameter that separates active and inactive features. Experimental studies on both simulations and real-world data applications are provided to show that ET-Lasso can effectively and efficiently select active features under a wide range of different scenarios.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Songshan Yang"", ids = ""7388953""); list(name = ""Jiawei Wen"", ids = ""3037841""); list(name = ""Xiang Zhan"", ids = ""48550915""); list(name = ""Daniel Kifer"", ids = ""1852261"")",feb79e1ed36ca9f9efa2792bbbeeabf87227c85f,d90199f223e270a23b76e838bd28c04cbe6e081b; ec26b01efa0639be672d07651d32a06bae4c8c63; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; 4ca5a833b8464a1e7ab46d04db6aeb2794eca848; 2942c20f111d6fd38ef6dd53bb6eeb3b880e3d5f; 50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; d28633983821aa3d886fd6379c52ea78dca51f28; c74cb2dc88baec89af714577ddafa454ab785135; a6f5c8d82f27bd68eb4cc40bc3d0b00fccc5d469; 8bb843b4f274d77c60944e5ac7365a2f36d76c7d; 1fa5e7b52eac69912d89dc2cbb4e7dd6040229da; 5a607f6990bdf37fa2623be43ede7fd55b5bed79; 66fa6d8f057a2fac0cc80112364bec7ad9088101; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; fc073321996d337e843173567f291d5dd557baa7; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485; 63c68278418b69f60b4814fae8dd15b1b1854295; f3196cb46d1f26986c9a2c3cde99eb9e2b1d205c; 7ed849c45ee0d5e45423226e967bfaab4af35e72; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; bb1a5a581e42f98ef0c56a1b8ce8773fbffb326b; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8,ArXiv,abs/1810.04513,
76f667df49db0e5a3a2f4fdd45995a120d3a6c32,Phase Transition and Regularized Bootstrap in Large Scale $t$-tests with False Discovery Rate Control,"Applying Benjamini and Hochberg (B-H) method to multiple Student's $t$ tests is a popular technique in gene selection in microarray data analysis. Because of the non-normality of the population, the true p-values of the hypothesis tests are typically unknown. Hence, it is common to use the standard normal distribution N(0,1), Student's $t$ distribution $t_{n-1}$ or the bootstrap method to estimate the p-values. In this paper, we first study N(0,1) and $t_{n-1}$ calibrations. We prove that, when the population has the finite 4-th moment and the dimension $m$ and the sample size $n$ satisfy $\log m=o(n^{1/3})$, B-H method controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given level $\alpha$ asymptotically with p-values estimated from N(0,1) or $t_{n-1}$ distribution. However, a phase transition phenomenon occurs when $\log m\geq c_{0}n^{1/3}$. In this case, the FDR of B-H method may be larger than $\alpha$ or even tends to one. In contrast, the bootstrap calibration is accurate for $\log m=o(n^{1/2})$ as long as the underlying distribution has the sub-Gaussian tails. However, such light tailed condition can not be weakened in general. The simulation study shows that for the heavy tailed distributions, the bootstrap calibration is very conservative. In order to solve this problem, a regularized bootstrap correction is proposed and is shown to be robust to the tails of the distributions. The simulation study shows that the regularized bootstrap method performs better than the usual bootstrap method.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Weidong Liu"", ids = ""2202986""); list(name = ""Qi-Man Shao"", ids = ""145930386"")",ccb8d00fcb651d0c8304e3f2b26ee81a28f59d93; a13f15b97d1d35812c4347696fe764eb8631dd70; eb3739ea45d55feee43fd88e65ace9462c67deff; bf468213c8802bfea7dbaf78ebb9f98dfe8ee195; a5187add24aa284ed29523684a841078c8aa613d; 315d1eed34cc519b51904b19f899145d220736b8; 43fc3f31a0686e6b2520e2576c0c1c599e86a4bb; 473b41b81b942ba295d40d34103e3c8e6eb83416; 623029ae0217fc6d3e1a4d5ad1f5704530a5f0c1; d78be1d2ce316dbce633190996c721d17ca428d3; 5b1ea4edf6e59d335ebff7cba28a5622456a23ea; ec22d633fcf6e2481953fba8d837368069314159; 9542f16f46fec8f7afef2dc6d7eb8b7d755d7354; ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877; f894480feb384ec064962637bbcba1a3b45716ab; b25d3f7af68de0027043a0c22a530c4a5aa36238; 16a70227704882f5506794720c600dc29a00ada1; 0b25aba6e6f65b1a6b903646c53512c33a10b7d3; fa499a7cb25be1ee090f00a7adc920da2f2e28ab; 43df40940722c09a776248ab4a090774dd29b704; da5a6f4bcc3d0a51ef73bc068f7f4254af8d5e19,a7cf287016d6011bb19e2abe2504b83dca58ea7f; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; d60607f4c936a83d3823d1dd3b575370ff7fbe3c; 918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785; 00cf7edecdfe2209d2dca825d15fc618b43aff34; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; aced86a6933b6259ddc1ef6879231f5d370510a8; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 6a48fec80015fa2917f3f24fa4af40588779243b; e4ab1fbeeaebfc457fb16cd366cf4745feae5a9a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf,arXiv: Methodology,,2003-2025
af360984a3232a858fbc20680c0dc559a88f0b9f,Structure-Based Whole Genome Realignment Reveals Many Novel Non-coding RNAs,"Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, however, is limited due to their reliance on sequence-based wholegenome aligners, which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for genomewide screens due to its extreme computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for de novo Prediction of structural ncRNA) that realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and structure and then evaluates the realignments for potential structural ncRNAs with a ncRNA predictor such as RNAz 2.0. For efficiency of the pipeline, we develop a novel banding realignment algorithm for the RNA multiple alignment tool LocARNA. This allows us to perform very fast structure-based realignment within limited deviation of the original multiple alignment from the WGA. We apply REAPR to the complete twelve Drosophila WGAs to predict ncRNAs across all these Drosophila species. Compared to direct prediction from the original WGA at the same False Discovery Rate (FDR), we predict twice as many high-confidence ncRNA candidates in D.melanogaster while less than doubling the run-time. As a novelty in ncRNA prediction, we control the FDR, going beyond the usual a posteriori FDR estimation. Applying the sequence-based alignment tool Muscle for realignment, we demonstrate that structure-based methods are necessary for effective prediction of originally misaligned ncRNAs. Comparing to recent screens of Drosophila and ENCODE we show that REAPR outperforms the widely-used de novo predictors RNAz, EvoFold, and CMfinder. Finally, we reveal, with high confidence, a putative structural motif in the long ncRNA roX1 of D.melanogaster, known to regulate X chromosome dosage compensation in male flies. Interestingly, we recapitulate the Drosophila phylogeny, based on co-predicted ncRNAs across all fly genomes.",2012,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sebastian Will"", ids = ""144002610""); list(name = ""Michael Yu"", ids = ""145015307""); list(name = ""Bonnie Berger"", ids = ""144472480"")",d8afae9fa5c9fce89d2fe288d2b87fe004ecb622; 7093d3bc8829472a8f33886adfb27827bffc1b69; d34a776e5c9d3a97ef7a0a9be006c0f28023b8cd; c4e5927cd860259e8f3c178c813f15e11ba14b32; 695a34e992ce9d4e4bb3e024529682561244e414; 28cd8e50eb6f78cf8af8f911ce29f123ec5f61f9; 29a9c268548c5a2623fe2bcf7915850157ae2ea3,1ecf1d5553c5edbcf0a52fc6fa44c7715b56db06; 1e44bd65e040f9f56156f4b7eab1db33a5b6aaf2; 05222402b5a48487fbde444d62fc631c96d6be13; 9942964162ef60f639946f70f4ad31da085ae75e; 20bc92377f4e00ea0bdacf5865992eaa2cea4f6c; d90e7f55955c15c05ba9c59bb709540f577ef2cf; cece26b94bfa0508985f88e290992fad7b16f750; a48b642dfc4833951abdc1bca7884a6e2d73e8cc; 0cda1f3f3005dac277b2255d943524d01e576221; 7f201defb7dc5347e36823d5b9b49c2ec71a53a0; 232c096a1bb4916b3c808a0e9c4b51f0cd368024; cdcef0f29a0e085cc96d630bbc4f68428fb4e6a0; 924b3dc59f36625318fa367635e1cb15d1853b4b; 7623cb1450f7c578bd3d5d6061cbeedd845d9bdb; 76ff7ab8e7cb3dcc353149386625e93348473715; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d49d38b1083f4d2485a7982108221eac5541e2c1; 8ff97028e280e71e697e1fea0009d71f15e68d3f; ad8192b931502da9df0889ba0d52dfabeb48d009; 69c265feb49e2f928c7d00b61217a7dbe387355c; eb19613f0c868b45a7cfe601c0e85f1e79351ce0; 548ad22350ef9824fa77819e9febf16840494a9e; fc7e070dfffb0b49165de7c41adaf2bfb6777a77; 8ef31edadab675197af1f4f0525adab3dde51ba8; e37092e3694e893fd000c974c899a4acaa1dd522; d46c27dff0650201f57e7381cec549736377489f; 6fc8d11741ad3130fe0772e0d3ad8916c9e4b9e5; d86e2351a43c195ff6b4833d0452a6c552854133; 68aa6ac364f4d4247fc37cd5f88c5717071915e1; f1248ef5155367f00d4398c106939ad4ff93545b; b858125e07e24108c4d533fd1ab711a701c5ed6b; bed435222ddb9e9390677ad3eef22422468512e8; 51fbd52496572e717b4bbacd4e62f72296774ffe; e392cceec9e5cb88ee983002a760e7589f66d9cc; 5ad7200ccd6236a8e7b8cb811fee143bde0ab4e7; d7c8e4d6ebf8a8d16dc9c7a7b1a8123025f0199e; bea85abfeb16a11676528cde3679efc952bc7a77; 6dc8e4f1602bcdea80bd9555ed0556ad1ac65a40; ccbc1fe7a55a702ae419878fecc0d40ddd06d42b; 210aba7ba30ddbf610f818e69c0ebcf08bdec8c9; 44657fb55d5ba3740e809ef34d522a659f5df605; 32914b6b8d9cae8073f3f34cb633b2036944434e; 7ffed3c14f85ebfbe7384f0a6efb86fd7fd9756f; 5650edb4da445615a861c85ceae9f5f68af63ff7; 17d61a353bb9f1b83b2f453779dbb37e2d358410; 45d688490019510d393ec81907d39dc58bf98bfa; d387847494decc85c5c907f959cb0803250296c3; 62d13c022aa0d49e243023c4d978d576be167d38; 9713488af6ada02fdc6288cff002ba91d60e0a8e; 7e0b685883ae47878e1eb90f80b7dab9a17e1dac,,,341
4231ab9275ce61dc332e0880d971d6fdb84ce24e,Preliminary genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder in the Japanese population.,"Recent progress in genotyping technology and the development of public databases has enabled large-scale genome-wide association tests with diseases. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) in Japanese cohorts. First we used Affymetrix 100K GeneChip arrays in the analysis of 107 cases with bipolar I disorder and 107 controls, and selected markers that were nominally significant (P < 0.01) in at least one of the three models (1,577 markers in total). In the follow-up stage, we analyzed these markers using an Illumina platform (1,526 markers; 51 markers were not designable for the platform) and an independent sample set, which consisted of 395 cases (bipolar I + II) and 409 controls. We also assessed the population stratification of current samples using principal components analysis. After the two-stage analysis, 89 markers remained nominally significant (allelic P < 0.05) with the same allele being consistently over-represented in both the first and the follow-up stages.

7fa48c5fc3c25ff0c0161abeea4e03fbe0cc9fc5,A Gene Score Test for Disease Association with Multiple Genes,"The traditional method for creating a gene score to predict a given outcome is to use the most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from all SNPs which were tested. There are several disadvantages of this approach such as excluding SNPs that do not have strong single effects when tested on their own but do have strong joint effects when tested together with other SNPs. The interpretation of results from the traditional gene score may lack biological insight since the functional unit of interest is often the gene, not the single SNP. In this paper we present a new gene scoring method, which overcomes these problems as it generates a gene score for each gene, and the total gene score for all the genes available. First, we calculate a gene score for each gene and second, we test the association between this gene score and the outcome of interest (i.e. trait). Only the gene scores which are significantly associated with the outcome after multiple testing correction for the number of gene tests (not SNPs) are considered in the total gene score calculation. This method controls false positive results caused by multiple tests within genes and between genes separately, and has the advantage of identifying multi-locus genetic effects, compared with the Bonferroni correction, false discovery rate (FDR), and permutation tests for all SNPs. Another main feature of this method is that we select the SNPs, which have different effects within a gene by using adjustment in multiple regressions and then combine the information from the selected SNPs within a gene to create a gene score. A simulation study has been conducted to evaluate finite sample performance of the proposed method.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Changchun Xie"", ids = ""40201195"")",,49f7d2a2e4f430282945995fa8f3a7a98ec49423; c4a29ee9e15f23ba79b6788520b4bac1c6b36354; 5f51f4e2ef66dab14d515335b4fdde0c55eb7cf0; a3f80b9bcb57a03c18a9160a8085a4f0d4dbc716; ba8762172ab6ed2306a37eb1a17e8340594600c8; ea54f0c0568cab38619ee51e6ac021e76d6a6559; 2b7de51507ca8b1e9aeff3729c3100406799d687,Open Journal of Statistics,01,15-18

To have the best prospects to make an impact in this process, a new study should be designed optimally taking into account the previous studies and other prior information. We propose a formal approach for the covariate prioritization, that is the decision about the covariates to be measured in a new study. The decision criteria can be based on conditional power, change of the p-value, change in lower confidence limit, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayes factors, Bayesian false discovery rate or difference between prior and posterior expectation. The criteria can be also used for decisions on the sample size. As an illustration, we consider covariate prioritization based on genome-wide association studies for C-reactive protein levels and make suggestions on the genes to be studied further.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juha Karvanen"", ids = ""2145872""); list(name = ""Mikko J.

9abe12b076ad85ab39d3fb4451383262dd70ba6f,Characterization of low grade serous carcinoma of the ovary and its precursorss,"Background: Low Grade Serous Carcinoma (LGSC) is a slow growing ovarian neoplasm affecting women in their 30s and 40s and is highly resistant to current chemotherapeutic regimens. Recent genomic hybridization and molecular biology studies have suggested that Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumor (LMP) may be a precursor lesion to LGSC as part of the type I pathway of ovarian carcinogenesis (Singer et al. Am Jo Path. 2002. 160;4:1223-1228). In addition, the significance of micropapillary features within LMP is being extensively studied as these features may indicate a more aggressive tumor behavior. (Seidman et al. Hum. Path. 1:539, 2000, Staebler et al., Hum. Path. 22:47, 2002). 
Hypothesis: We propose to study the expression profiles of LMP, LMP with micropapillary features (LMP-MP) and LGSC. We hypothesize that given its increased aggressive tumor behaviour, LMP-MP may exhibit a genetic profile that is similar to LGSC and not LMP and may represent an intermediate lesion in the malignant transformation of LMP into LGSC. Genes that are differentially expressed between the tumors will be studied in an attempt to identify those involved in carcinogenesis. 
Materials & Methods: Snap-frozen tissue samples from primary ovarian tumors, diagnosed as LMP (n=19), LMP-MP (n=8), or LGSC (n=12) were selected from the Toronto Ovarian Tissue Bank. Laser Capture Microdissection was used to separately isolate epithelial cells from tumor specimens. RNA was extracted, amplified, reverse transcribed to cDNA and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 arrays. Following normalization, the expression data was analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) as an initial step. Further analysis using Array Assist and Binary Tree Structured Vector Quantization are underway. Integration of the list of differentially expressed genes with a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions will be used to select functionally related genes for validation and functional studies. Validation will include both real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. We will then use in vitro models to initially determine the impact of these key genes on proliferation, cell motility, and/or invasion. For those genes we suspect as playing a key role in malignant transformation, we will attempt to alter expression in cultured ovarian epithelial cells and determine the impact on colony forming ability in soft agar and/or anchorage independent growth. 
Preliminary Results: A total of 40 tumor samples have been profiled. Preliminary SAM analysis has indicated 134 probe sets (representing genes) as differentially expressed between LMP and LGSC, 47 genes between LMP and LMP-MP, and 180 genes between LMP and LMP-MP+LGSC. No differential gene expression was detected between LMP-MP and LGSC at a false discovery rate below 89%. 
Significance: These initial findings appear to support our hypothesis that LMP-MP is genetically similar to LGSC. Further analysis of the individual tumorsâ€™ genetic profiles is underway, which may allow us to identify specific markers to refine their pathological diagnosis. In addition, we will attempt to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the non-invasive disease (LMP) and the invasive tumors (LMP-MP and LGSC). We propose that these genes will likely be involved in malignant transformation. We will use a bioinformatics approach and integrate these selected proteins with the list of 1732 potential secreted proteins identified by Welsh et al (Proc Natl Acad Sci U.S.A 100:3410, 2003) to highlight potential serum markers for early stage disease. Furthermore, we may be able to identify markers that would allow us to predict which low malignant potential tumors are more likely to progress to an aggressive neoplasm, which would allow clinicians to tailor medical and surgical treatments according to the patientâ€™s individual risk of progressing to a frank malignancy. Lastly, we hope to identify potential molecular therapeutic targets that may lead to the development of novel treatments for LGSC, which would improve patient management and overall survival.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Taymaa May"", ids = ""102925592""); list(name = ""Monika Sharma"", ids = ""145092222""); list(name = ""Igor Jurisica"", ids = ""1976557""); list(name = ""Barry P.

a7e9c075dd73b54b9c311e82d2bffd987312f066,Brain Imagingâ€Guided Analysis Reveals DNA Methylation Profiles Correlated with Insular Surface Area and Alcohol Use Disorder,"BACKGROUND
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a wide-spread, heritable brain disease, but few studies have linked genetic variants or epigenetic factors to brain structures related to AUD in humans, due to many factors including the high-dimensional nature of imaging and genomic data.


METHODS
To provide potential insights into the links among epigenetic regulation, brain structure, and AUD, we have performed an integrative analysis of brain structural imaging and blood DNA methylome data from 52 AUD and 58 healthy control (HC) subjects collected in the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample.


RESULTS
We first found that AUD subjects had significantly larger insular surface area than HC in both left and right hemispheres. We then found that 7,827 DNA methylation probes on the HumanMethylation450K BeadChip had significant correlations with the right insular surface area (false discovery rate [FDR]Â <Â 0.05). Furthermore, we showed that 44 of the insular surface area-correlated methylation probes were also strongly correlated with AUD status (FDRÂ <Â 0.05). These AUD-correlated probes are annotated to 36 protein-coding genes, with 16 genes (44%) having been reported by others to be related to AUD or alcohol response, including TAS2R16 and PER2. The remaining 20 genes, in particular ARHGAP22, might represent novel genes involved in AUD or responsive to alcohol.


CONCLUSIONS
We have identified 36 insular surface area- and AUD-correlated protein-coding genes that are either known to be AUD- or alcohol-related or not yet reported by prior studies. Therefore, our study suggests that the brain imaging-guided epigenetic analysis has a potential of identifying possible epigenetic mechanisms involved in AUD.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Yihong Zhao"", ids = ""46317126""); list(name = ""Yongchao Ge"", ids = ""2547529""); list(name = ""Zhi-Liang Zheng"", ids = ""40482800"")",,ee90b4f96c30553174e0c7bc1bbf1d1ca5698912; 1656a20a716ac441fbf51affe87b565105f94e7b; 330ab04748a34f49d1c63e21311ff5ced19b736c; f0e420b57065da2d189288925ec044323bafa26a; a98901b2de4f221e14b30d8152bb737f33670f20; 9a2d57053a8f904581f064c5c86b23d9065b5e32; 34cbf8415c097dd0b4f9f777ca75a7adb7918f46; dafdc50de3e7fafdde2b7f2528abebcde59591db; 529a234d0b030e7216e648bf91f3acd281bad299; d16197ec30fc24f89deecbc04715d791141c1552; e8a6a9f06adc0ffd3ea8445ffae0c886b1a3550b; 372510159cc52abae661ae3e3b5ab3eff96c7535; bde0aad06e45e77e0671b8ffe9ea8540e88e1c7f; ebd11ec08cbb3474024debaa5b4177d07ec26e3a; 214ae9c3642bbb47f519ce6b2d23857a2779865a; 9f19df9050002e5976ac2406335c7e316cd84102; f368dada3321ab39e2086d5181e652dfe6bdc82c; cd7bdd8eadd781ba75848d49c59e3d195adf731b; 6649798bbf290b72a7929cc58ff8fa327127fc36; e6d4cc29342ca4a7ddd362c14a6b7bec56c5b9f9; 25d4d3392d267a87e31477f6f41625200b9b776e; 8a832f058fc55701bb2412a8fca433a16cf52080; 1c36cd57f0df510e102469b96043446401415b4b; 22b0955830d6d7f64395b1ee80e6e69f99f4e4a4; 118cdcf302328a5896de4adbb1e2554641212091; 4fe4cf573f9cbad6c9de98712870e569e933eb10; ad4e281293237bdb8efbbd639ac823536815f42b; 1277e12b9ac677a77221fc539bea67d6c00b9018; 80e21fbf57f67ab5584e6263f47d5e33eee2d2f4; dda29203c481276d1e349f421399c62b68dd3d81; 9da03859dfd9f742380192dc96f7fa042b70094e; ae5812c5af704bb8a4b7295a4b9044164caf57d8; f3d205d8e3e442882d884d3a7fc27c45989fd032; 05645506c2e35bb37d2fc383427b1a54fa14a330; 5ca7c6519a03d3ed8e2ce09b8e85e2b51e9966af; 6871018ded682a1010294c2ca09ad62f9dc1c843; 19f501cb408b0479b8e01c6a1454ba5e83f709ec; ee609ae8a18e612b8edeb508e774c813620791d3; c2acc9196eea1e249c41f0125a5a9752764d454a; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 1633f07633458445c5e520a43879dc8dd1bfc2ed; 4f759e1ad93ce4e44052bf83480bda997fe1cc92; 2c3d49d333514ca29ffa128dca631e5f5cfbfe5b; f169213870e6a78ae583eef34500dea2a64b07ab; 9cfba6b2edefc3c64c6a1e57ebc335efbf92df5d; adada1ca92c0b2366aacb15b8885c51a5fca4dd1; afd9d7640544b0d6158914f1b87a523f13e6d7df; 1ec1d0b6805d630b27fe2107953a9b8fbbb6b4b0; ea7d12a253d6a1d9870be296b5650f776ffa7b7e; 61d54914fcd51ddcd951f003e6c5fa2666a8cd1d; 92ec4cf67bffdc19740867c6c5daa6a7dc055ca9; 5a7e124162c57401997d60c35305a778895508f9; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 218e1741fd5a510e22221e544e8c280183a0422d; f1bcbe5845406cf32742e8d2219498c23337f9a5; a419d2141d26f01abcaffefad524087393eb88ce; df0f6559e5c4c3a5eb0049af299e701418b4fe40; f24f37b2dfbed2134627cb5cd9dda53149611088; 893a0988f95ff049925672d90063aa2e3fc7a1fa; cec7404aecf0b8ac1604789c32cb765eea8f821a; d2d54687ee17bd39055c649a27c46f58edea9935; e15fcd9bc6b57ba53adfb5bd0d06dda7d1f9f510; 7eb573283f14b7b0814f8f87effcc7d2b13e0569; 86e0717031752f709172a4be81ca9e741b2bb7d4; 1985304407363fd1f0a3f26a002a560555abadfb; 79bd78ac1c93470848aa50f49f86196c0ec4cb80; 1b351b38036ace9e8488c36b801968f85bada98c; b79df3bffedba5e554e719a02347f9ea3daa4575; fd2eaaddb9e999a11d279086c56482218c2eeecd; 81298cb9810268783ef72f26ed11848b9ac2280e; eb628bd904a1b4b300993164fb65d727c706bfc2; 8ca953a6ec1dbac795342b24451bbb8b6fd2e53e; c72c725e5beb1d58bac848736617586ddc72f9b1; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 726adcc295eaf1ad1b140b792321651593ee5d2d; dc79bfbfb5c046e45e80ea7acb87cef1a1d9a27a,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,43,628â€“639
c75949be9fc3777c1c472da3c30be475d318aa03,Whole Genome MBD-seq reveals different CpG methylation patterns in Azacytidine-treated Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (JMML) patients.,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) is a rare and severe form of early childhood leukaemia characterized by clonal proliferation of myelomonocytic cells, progressive anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly and increased fetal haemoglobin (HbF) (Chan et al, 2009). The only available curative treatment is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but prognosis remains poor (Niemeyer & Kratz, 2008; Locatelli & Niemeyer, 2015). It has previously been shown that aberrant DNA hypermethylation of distinct target genes defines more aggressive variants of JMML (Flotho et al, 2007; Furlan et al, 2009; Olk-Batz et al, 2011; Poetsch et al, 2014). Azacytidine (AZA) is a DNA hypomethylating agent recently employed for JMML treatment (Locatelli & Niemeyer, 2015). To evaluate AZA treatment impact on aberrant methylation in JMML, we screened global DNA methylation in 3 JMML patients before and after AZA treatment. We found global DNA hypermethylation in both preand post-AZA treated patient samples compared to healthy controls, and a significant, although patient-specific, AZA-induced hypomethylation effect. Furthermore, we identified several differentially methylated coding and non-coding species of RNA, depicting a complex deregulation at different levels of transcription and translation in JMML. CD34 cells were isolated from frozen mononuclear cell suspensions. Three JMML patients at both diagnosis (t0 group) and after the third cycle of AZA (t1 group) (Furlan et al, 2009) were studied (Table SI); three additional healthy donor (HD) control samples were also included (HD group). Informed consent was obtained from either parents or legal guardians according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the â€œBambino Ges uâ€ Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Rome. JMML patients were treated with AZA as a compassionate use. Methods for CD34 cells isolation, their percentage assessment and genomic DNA extraction and sequence analysis are detailed in Data S1. The complete DNA-seq datasets are available at the European Bioinformatics Institute European Nucleotide Archive (EBI ENA) database (http://www. ebi.ac.uk/ena; accession number: PRJEB19377). Gene lists and ontologies are available in supplemental files. After Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) sequencing (EBI ENA database; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) we compared t0 and HD groups (File S1), detecting 987 different transcriptional units corresponding to 714 coding and 273 non-coding sequences, mostly hypermethylated in t0 (Fig 1A Panel i, ii). A functional protein association network (STRING; http://string-db.org/) (Szklarczyk et al, 2015) identified 18 different pathways possibly impaired by deregulated DNA-methylation (Figure S1; Table I; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0 05). The same analysis on t1 and HD groups identified 643 unique transcriptional units, with 468 coding and 175 non-coding sequences, indicating a strong tendency towards hypermethylation in JMML samples (File S2; Fig 1A Panel i, ii). Again, the functional protein association network identified 10 putative impaired pathways, similarly to t0 vs. HD analysis (Figure S2; Table I; FDR < 0 05), even if DNA hypermethylation after AZA treatment was reduced. Involvement of membrane elements, such as adhesion molecules, developmental processes and cell cycle-related genes was recurrent in our analysis, meaning that identifying insights of these pathways could help to further enlighten pathogenic mechanisms and novel targets for therapy in JMML. Unexpectedly, direct comparative methylation analysis of samples obtained at onset of JMML and after AZA treatment (t0 vs. t1) did not show any significant difference (File S3), suggesting a probable unspecific and unique patient-related pharmacological effect, which was also evident when considering single-case analysis (Figure S3; File S4, S5, S6). Notably, 453 differentially methylated coding regions were shared between newly diagnosed JMML and AZA-treated samples compared to HD (Table SII). Additionally, 261 and 15 coding regions with different methylation status were specific for t0 and t1 respectively (Fig 1B Panel i; Table SII). Among non-coding regions, we also found 165 sequences shared between the two groups (Table SII), while 107 and 10 were unique in the t0 vs. HD and t1 vs. HD, respectively (Fig 1B Panel ii; Table SII). Interestingly, 439 coding and 161 non-coding specific genomic regions preserved their hypermethylated status, describing an apparent resistance to AZA treatment (Fig 1B Panel iii, iv; Table SII). We found different non-coding RNA species, such as microRNAs, splicing RNAs, long noncoding RNAs/antisense transcripts (AS) and other nondescript RNA species (Table SII; Supplemental files), identifying a complex deregulation of preand post-transcriptional processes in JMML pathogenesis possibly acting in a cooperative way. correspondence",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Pier Paolo Leoncini"", ids = ""47894125""); list(name = ""Patrizia Vitullo"", ids = ""3883859""); list(name = ""Francesca Di Florio"", ids = ""1398421763""); list(name = ""Valeria Maria Giuseppa Tocco"", ids = ""14721131""); list(name = ""Maria Giuseppina Cefalo"", ids = ""5479942""); list(name = ""Angela Pitisci"", ids = ""4486081""); list(name = ""Katia Girardi"", ids = ""32094411""); list(name = ""Charlotte Niemeyer"", ids = ""50419341""); list(name = ""Franco Locatelli"", ids = ""30091661""); list(name = ""Alice Bertaina"", ids = ""3121274"")",,86087d2f7c730bc50da58bfe57c0b7944c3b7f52; 1e01031725684d5f8622e861e4580298eda3dcf2; d8028c67ecbf37de8253ddc15468cbb9f91a50fb; 16164c59f1c13ed7a82a03e6de9582101ffb4e7b; 52233169a7dfb261667ac9d9d568b6776a71a854; 5da01e3c22878edd674e778f23edad9b115ef811; e911ab7d6728f06dee4cfd5576b34f1ffb606039; 07577591093f22d65989a89ed3c8f6a66609933e; 1b532160447dfa6d62ddee2029c8de0b96edf86e,British journal of haematology,182 6,"

b3aa53cdce3ae6fae402847901f7195a4c773ae7,The developmental dynamics of the sweet sorghum root transcriptome elucidate the differentiation of apoplastic barriers.,"Apoplastic barriers in the endodermis, such as Casparian strips and suberin lamellae, control the passage of water and minerals into the stele. Apoplastic barriers are thus thought to contribute to salt exclusion in salt-excluding plants such as sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). However, little is known about the genes involved in the development of the apoplastic barrier. Here, we identified candidate genes involved in Casparian strip and suberin lamella development in the roots of a sweet sorghum line (M-81E). Three distinct developmental regions (no differentiation, developing, and mature) were identified based on Casparian strip and suberin lamella staining in root cross sections. Sequencing of RNA extracted from these distinct sections identified key genes participating in the differentiation of the apoplastic barrier. The different sections were structurally distinct, presumably due to differences in gene expression. Genes controlling the phenylpropanoid pathway, fatty acid elongation, and fatty acid Ï‰-hydroxylation appeared to be directly responsible for the formation of the apoplastic barrier. Our dataset elucidates the molecular processes underpinning apoplastic barrier development and provides a basis for future research on molecular mechanisms of apoplastic barrier formation and salt exclusion.Abbreviations: SHR, SHORTROOT; MYB, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN; CIFs, Casparian strip integrity factors; CASP, Casparian strip domain proteins; PER, peroxidase; ESB1, ENHANCED SUBERIN1; CS, Casparian strip; RPKM, reads per kilobase per million reads; DEGs, differentially expressed genes; FDR, false discovery rate; GO, Gene Ontology; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; RNA-seq, RNA sequencing; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; CYP, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; AAE5, ACYL-ACTIVATING ENZYME5; CCR, cinnamoyl CoA reductase; TKPR, TETRAKETIDE ALPHA-PYRONE REDUCTASE1; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HST, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; PMAT2, PHENOLIC GLUCOSIDE MALONYLTRANSFERASE2; CCOAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; KCS, Î²-ketoacyl-CoA synthase; CUT1, CUTICULAR PROTEIN1; DET2, 5-alpha-reductase; TAX, 3'-N-debenzoyl-2'-deoxytaxol N-benzoyltransferase; CER1, ECERIFERUM1; FAR, fatty acyl reductase; AF-CoA, alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductase; ABCG, ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G; ERF, ethylene-responsive transcription factor; HSF, heat stress transcription factor; NTF, NUCLEAR TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR Y SUBUNIT B-5; GPAT, glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase.",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiaocen Wei"", ids = ""23556102""); list(name = ""Zhen Yang"", ids = ""12107063""); list(name = ""Guoliang Han"", ids = ""32742113""); list(name = ""Xin Zhao"", ids = ""144854849""); list(name = ""Shanshan Yin"", ids = ""35368789""); list(name = ""Fang Yuan"", ids = ""46534583""); list(name = ""Baoshan Wang"", ids = ""34957522"")",,,Plant signaling & behavior,,"

f503176652984bbc4eb18bc1723a9417b3667aa7,Association of Gene-Environment Interactions with Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): A Pathway-Directed Candidate-Gene Case-Control Study,"Abstract 480 Background: While interaction between Factor V Leiden and other VTE risk exposures (i.e., oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, pregnancy, cancer, minor trauma) compound VTE risk, whether other gene-environment interactions are associated with VTE is largely unknown. Objective: To test gene-environment interactions for an association with VTE. Methods: Cases (n=1488) were Mayo Clinic European-American patients of non-Hispanic ancestry with objectively-diagnosed VTE in the absence of active cancer, venous catheter or antiphospholipid antibodies. Controls (n=1439) were Mayo Clinic outpatients without VTE who were frequency-matched on case age, gender, race, MI/stroke status and state of residence. We selected candidate genes relevant to the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic and innate immunity pathways, focusing on platelet, monocyte, neutrophil and endothelial cell agonists, receptors, ligands, signal transduction and adhesion molecules, granule contents and effectors; plasma proteases and inhibitors; matrix metalloproteases; inflammatory cytokines and receptors; estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors; co-regulators and enzymes related to estrogen metabolism; important enzymes for catechol, homocysteine, thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin biosynthesis and metabolism; and HMG CoA reductase. For these genes (n=750), we selected all non-synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) with minor allele frequency â‰¥0.5%; the remaining SNPs were selected using an LD tagging algorithm (Carlson et al. AJHG 2004); 479 ancestry-informative markers were also included (total n=13,241 SNPs). Leukocyte genomic DNA was genotyped using a custom Illumina Infinium iSelect platform, including appropriate controls. We tested all pairwise interactions between 12,483 SNPs (12296 autosomal, 187 chromosome X) that passed quality control and each of seven exposures (ever â€œstressâ€[defined as ever hospitalized, ever surgery, ever trauma, ever transfemoral procedure or ever leg paresis], ever surgery, ever neurosurgery, ever orthopedic surgery; and among women, ever pregnant, â‰¥3 pregnancies and ever oral contraceptives/hormone therapy), adjusted for age, gender, MI/stroke status and state of residence, using logistic regression. False discovery rates (q-value) were calculated to estimate the expected fraction of false positive associations due to multiple statistical tests. Results: The mean Â± SD case and control ages were 55.3 Â± 16.4 and 56.5 Â± 15.9 years, respectively, and 51% were female. Analysis of ancestry-informative markers revealed no evidence of population stratification. Among the seven models, a significant interaction (qâ‰¤0.05) was found between ever surgery and two genes located on chromosome 1: USF1 (rs2516840, OR=2.1, p=2.0E-06; q=0.02), and F11R (rs790055 & rs790056; ORâˆ¼2.29, pâˆ¼4E-06; q=0.02); the two F11R SNPs are in complete linkage dysequilibrium ( LD ), and the USF1 SNP is in moderate LD with the F11R SNPs (r2âˆ¼0.6). USF1 encodes for upstream transcription factor 1 which regulates many genes involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis. F11R encodes for the platelet F11 receptor (JAM [junctional adhesion molecule], a cell adhesion molecule important for platelet adhesion to cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells. Conclusion: Interaction between surgery and SNPs within USF1 and F11R are associated with significantly increased risks for VTE.

f312206bca6cf6fe4c437a68f4c86c804da4659a,Inadequate protein intake affects skeletal muscle transcript profiles in older humans.,"BACKGROUND
Inadequate dietary protein intake causes adverse changes in the morphology and function of skeletal muscle. These changes may be reflected in early alterations in muscle messenger RNA levels.


OBJECTIVE
This study assessed whether inadequate protein intake differentially affects skeletal muscle transcript concentrations and expression profiles in older adults.


DESIGN
Twenty-one older men and women (aged 55-80 y) consumed controlled diets that provided 1.2 g protein x kg(-1) x d(-1) (adequate protein) for 1 wk and then were randomly assigned to consume either 0.5 g protein x kg(-1) x d(-1) [inadequate protein (IP) group; n=11] or 1.2 g protein x kg(-1) x d(-1) (control group; n=10) for a second week. RNA was isolated from fasting-state vastus lateralis biopsy samples obtained at the end of each period, and transcript levels in the IP group were measured by using microarray analysis. Changes in selected transcript levels were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in both groups.


RESULTS
Analysis of variance showed 529 differentially expressed transcripts (P<0.05) after inadequate protein intake. Using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction to adjust for multiple comparisons, we observed that 85 transcripts were differentially expressed: 54 were up-regulated and 31 were down-regulated. The differentially expressed transcripts were in functional classes for immune, inflammatory, and stress responses (predominantly up-regulated); contraction, movement, and development (up-regulated); extracellular connective tissue (up-regulated); energy metabolism (down-regulated); protein synthesis (down-regulated); and proliferation (down-regulated). Diet-related differences in the expression of 9 transcripts were cross-validated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction.


CONCLUSION

We describe a method termed Immunohistochemical staining, laser capture microdissection (LCM) and filter-aided sample preparation (FASP)-Assisted Proteomic analysis of Target cell populations within tissue samples (ILFAPT). The principle of ILFAPT is that a target cell population expressing a protein of interest can be lit up by immunohistochemical staining and isolated from tissue sections using LCM for FASP and proteomic analysis. Using this method, we isolated a small population of CD90(+) stem-like cells from glioblastoma multiforme tissue sections and identified 674 high-confidence (false discovery rate < 0.01) proteins from 32 nL of CD90(+) cells by LC-MS/MS using an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. We further quantified the relative abundance of proteins identified from equal volumes of LCM-captured CD90(+) and CD90(-) cells, where 109 differentially expressed proteins were identified. The major group of these differentially expressed proteins was relevant to cell adhesion and cellular movement. This ILFAPT method has demonstrated the ability to provide in-depth proteome analysis of a very small specific cell population within tissues. It can be broadly applied to the study of target cell populations within clinical specimens.",2013,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jintang He"", ids = ""6011389""); list(name = ""Jianhui Zhu"", ids = ""47054891""); list(name = ""Yashu Liu"", ids = ""1740333""); list(name = ""Jing Wu"", ids = ""49387498""); list(name = ""Song Nie"", ids = ""4192332""); list(name = ""Jason A.

381019d9df727df871bfaa71c43f73cbeaf42e75,microRNA profiling in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms: the significance of miR-155.,"AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm) is a potentially life-threatening late-onset degenerative condition. miRNAs (microRNAs), the small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, have been shown previously to be associated with a broad range of human pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to identify AAA-associated miRNAs potentially contributing to AAA pathology. We analysed the expression of 124 miRNAs within AAA biopsies and serum of ten patients undergoing AAA repair, and serum from ten age- and sex-matched subjects without AAA, using the FlexmiRâ„¢ MicroRNA Assay. RNA extracted from the site of main AAA dilatation (AAA body) was compared with that extracted from the macroscopically non-dilated neck of the AAA (AAA neck). Similarly, RNA extracted from the serum of AAA patients (AAA serum) was compared with that extracted from age- and sex-matched controls (control serum). qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR), Western blot analysis and histology were performed using an independent set of six paired AAA body and neck biopsies to examine the validity of findings. Seven miRNAs were up-regulated [>2-fold difference, FDR (false discovery rate) <0.5] within AAA biopsies, of which miR-155 was the most differentially expressed (11.32-fold, FDR=0.414). This finding was confirmed by qPCR with the median relative expression of miR-155 being 3.26 and 0.63 within AAA body and AAA neck biopsies respectively (P=0.031). Circulating miR-155 was also increased in AAA patients compared with controls, with a 2.67-fold up-regulation at borderline significance (FDR=0.554). Two immunologically important miR-155 target genes, CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein) and SMAD2, were assessed and found to be significantly down-regulated within AAA bodies compared with AAA necks (P=0.032 and P=0.026) as determined by qPCR and Western blotting respectively. Histology demonstrated dense accumulation of T-lymphocytes within the adventitial and outer medial layers of AAA body, but not neck tissue. The results of the present study suggest that miR-155 is overexpressed in AAA with potential implications in the pathogenesis of the condition.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Erik Biros"", ids = ""47678309""); list(name = ""Corey S.

72dc6c8647876c59200c85ee681213c9af403f8b,Decreased PSD95 expression in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was associated with cognitive impairment induced by sevoflurane anesthesia,"ObjectiveThough sevoflurane has been widely used as an anesthetic in surgery, recent studies have shown that exposure to sevoflurane alone could lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), of which the mechanisms still remain largely unknown. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to be implicated in various cognitive impairments, including working memory and attentional processes. In the present study, we tried to identify dysregulated gene expression in mPFC and investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in POCD.MethodsBehavioral tests, including elevated plus-maze, O-maze, and Y-maze tests, were performed on Wistar rats exposed to sevoflurane. Whole-genome mRNA profiling of mPFC from Wistar rats after exposure to sevoflurane was carried out. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done to verify the differentially expressed genes.ResultsSignificant impairment of working memory of rats after exposure to sevoflurane was observed. A total of 119 of 7319 detected mRNAs showed significantly different expression between rats with and without sevoflurane exposure (fold change (FC)>2.0, P<0.05, and false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05), among which 74 mRNAs were down-regulated and 45 mRNAs were up-regulated. Postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95, also named DLG4) showed the most significantly decreased expression in mPFC and further investigation indicated that PSD95 expression level was correlated with spatial working memory performance.ConclusionsOur study revealed that PSD95 might be involved in the mechanism of POCD, which could provide clues for preventing POCD in clinical operations.ä¸­æ–‡æ¦‚è¦ç›®çš„ä¸´åºŠä¸ŠæŽ¥å—ä¸ƒæ°Ÿçƒ·éº»é†‰çš„ç—…äºº,æœ¯åŽä¼šå‡ºçŽ°è®¤çŸ¥åŠŸèƒ½æŸä¼¤ã€‚æœ¬ç ”ç©¶æ—¨åœ¨æŒ–æŽ˜ä¸ƒæ°Ÿçƒ·éº»é†‰å¯¼è‡´çš„å†…ä¾§å‰é¢å¶çš®å±‚ä¸­åŸºå› è¡¨è¾¾è°±çš„æ”¹å˜,å¹¶æŽ¢è®¨æœ¯åŽ è®¤çŸ¥åŠŸèƒ½æ”¹å˜çš„æœºåˆ¶ã€‚åˆ›æ–°ç‚¹æœ¬ç ”ç©¶æ·±å…¥æŽ¢è®¨ä¸ƒæ°Ÿçƒ·éº»é†‰å¯¼è‡´è®¤çŸ¥åŠŸèƒ½æŸä¼¤çš„åˆ†å­æœºåˆ¶,å……åˆ†åˆ©ç”¨è¡¨è¾¾è°±å’ŒåŠ¨ç‰©è¡Œä¸ºå­¦å®žéªŒæ¥æ­ç¤ºå¯èƒ½çš„åˆ†å­æœºåˆ¶ã€‚æ–¹æ³•é‡‡ç”¨åå­—è¿·å®«ã€O è¿·å®«å’Œæ°´è¿·å®«åˆ†æžæŽ¥å—ä¸åŒæ—¶é—´ä¸ƒæ°Ÿçƒ·å¤„ç†çš„Wistar å¤§é¼ çš„è¡Œä¸ºå­¦ç‰¹å¾;åŒæ—¶æå–å®žéªŒå¤§é¼ å†…ä¾§å‰é¢å¶çš®å±‚çš„ mRNA è¿›è¡Œè¡¨è¾¾è°±åˆ†æž(å›¾3),é‡‡ç”¨å®žæ—¶èšåˆé…¶é“¾ååº” (real-time PCR)å¯¹å·®å¼‚è¡¨è¾¾mRNA è¿›è¡ŒéªŒè¯ã€‚ç»“è®ºå†…ä¾§å‰é¢å¶çš®å±‚ä¸­PSD95 è¡¨è¾¾é‡é™ä½Žä¸Žä¸ƒæ°Ÿçƒ·éº»é†‰è¯±å¯¼çš„è®¤çŸ¥åŠŸèƒ½æŸä¼¤æœ‰å…³ã€‚",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yun-zhi Ling"", ids = ""4013717""); list(name = ""Wei Ma"", ids = ""143924998""); list(name = ""Li Yu"", ids = ""91887867""); list(name = ""Yuan Zhang"", ids = ""46867556""); list(name = ""Qi-sheng Liang"", ids = ""4813365"")",6ed1dd3fa4fead769df7051d4c2cbd05bbdad1d5; d8fab39869868eb4c49b60c5f708ec6a3dba8792; 973974719c918199161de5bdee22043b7c40d6b4; 8e3cf4603d7ecc89c484c94d656e66a1b470e369; 593ec5051c1df689910558c519bc83aac145c813; c61817211a7e71117ab278e0c0c37f251d0a04c2; f1657d243107e09083f0215c3b33d0c91ea05eb1; d9aee351c52e75ad77166e6516719a8a66ed76f2; d0251a2bc255673eb3c98ff50d20a4f86926888e,43f1c62751141a13fea494183389bcae72036c61; a0e0ecd26a0933e9459eff73c320a4e54e11b5d2; 0d0f5554c5943a1754077efb9153fc34758b1c06; 31f6e0c40005957a7ec145b7b0ad1dbae6de180d; 43dfb41eefada27fde3dd5f7f0c2e426444f25fb; 71dc3085040b7410bee52c597e7b88c4c5824d0c; 9110aa13ada201344920af9f82ebac195dfae31b; 51496a03eaded462e67a0f0d0270873d64b80e84; 6350f46ccb171875d9761034b00ec10e0783e926; 521b02735628fa0e6d3d02cb4d9a869ab5c9bade; c86900fc9f326e9861adc395c7e4be93dcdb8c2c; 8f6788a58b9ce393f45cdeca9ad996395ac628c0; 4aa2e6c0d734c977907762a6276de81d827645ba; 739394a220525192e0e0a439edf68e8aca8abef1; 17e00f4e07724f4e8354fd73333213695b91223d; 0d7f81e1fc7a312411a7d41fef6e4527d9a5dee6; e15ca1c2cdb0f2617b2a281e1a4bdba82f1489f2; a462dbb2d36aa850d6d5b2dd62efe1404119026e; b3fe52e6864a39cf854905a460f8c96512370804; 4e4fca9879d73fcc1148314b0de3cea186283501; e37bbfc9b4a89cf5c7a801735b339bfda11a7dbc; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; a114c568d34f7bff4a89b4a33a776b072700505c; 46dacfcbb996d2135c12488462cb34c61ecb893f; db8f976d3d49b74ce586bf40652f9875563adfe9; 68b7922509f08cf2bd7d1c74ce191e108dc17c24; f9c27a921b45bc09a854fd23f537852144548ec5; d24c70bd6f6ec11d58935bda11878e5d05b49467; 9f6af594bb5225cbfd78fbe588b05abf114b7738; fdf2309121e81e55fb01f2ee761d2b5e2343955f; dee31fac72d9114f4203308fbbc972a8d6e69424,Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE B,16,763-771
ac2e7c3e348c24acb09b1ef82e3e1d5811a4e7c7,The Bayes oracle and asymptotic optimality of multiple testing procedures under sparsity,"We investigate the asymptotic optimality of a large class of multiple testing rules using the framework of Bayesian Decision Theory. We consider a parametric setup, in which observations come from a normal scale mixture model and assume that the total loss is the sum of losses for individual tests. Our model can be used for testing point null hypotheses of no signals (zero effects), as well as to distinguish large signals from a multitude of very small effects. The optimality of a rule is proved by showing that, within our chosen asymptotic framework, the ratio of its Bayes risk and that of the Bayes oracle (a rule which minimizes the Bayes risk) converges to one. Our main interest is in the asymptotic scheme under which the proportion p of ""true"" alternatives converges to zero. We fully characterize the class of fixed threshold multiple testing rules which are asymptotically optimal and hence derive conditions for the asymptotic optimality of rules controlling the Bayesian False Discovery Rate (BFDR). We also provide conditions under which the popular Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni procedures are asymptotically optimal and show that for a wide class of sparsity levels, the threshold of the former can be approximated very well by a non-random threshold. As far as we know, this is the first proof of the decision theoretic asymptotic optimality of the Benjamini-Hochberg rule in the context of hypothesis testing.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""144726010""); list(name = ""Arijit Chakrabarti"", ids = ""89845683""); list(name = ""Jayanta Ghosh"", ids = ""144991582""); list(name = ""Florian Frommlet"", ids = ""2638433"")",2af8c866eb889246c8ad90ebcc9cba5a56f6706c; a02445c8edc4a074e812c7de9d076e3ffda78fc2; f374353459d91290437cb2f83f9f775e2209a1e6; f63b7943f0a9f85bb182a04cc0fd0adbd468c06b; 2c44934e3260fedd1672581805ff328cade714ed,e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; cfc36464bd56c7395d27712a0e03bf2bf06342a6; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8cc9918add61ee5ef3b848aba9646169cc5e364e; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 08600900eac695fdba3bf453c6f02a6bf4b7f236; 43a4585394e4cb50c365483291a8778b9b29dbda; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 6b9f7f214abbe504b8ba69be77c030eb1fc44412; 871e801536dc7d5b52eae7b8ff62b00ac968a0b2; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; dc5c799d20933dc0d997801f9db104c4c3a2022d; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; c174f3cd783f6d7c60f45465a11531dad3ec0ceb; 668557ea6b31cd30f3d20dd808303c2686375e7b; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; a9082bbfcc2b4374f4367d47e14ed76d73cf4d70; 5f110b912c8fce3204cf98b88917350e03fe361b; 0cd6a57304e89656611273d9d58d918b52e9c81e; 51d88925443329a35e9afe25a4b9cdbc4fd8e04d; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de,,,
bae524227a7435fe2b692ad5dae30df74de401f9,Non-small cell lung cancer is characterised by a distinct inflammatory signature in serum compared with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Development of lung cancer is closely related to smoking in a majority of patients. Most smokers, however, do not develop lung cancer in spite of a high mutational load accumulating in the lung tissue. Here we investigate whether a cancer-specific footprint can be revealed by investigating circulating inflammatory markers in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both cohorts characterised by similar smoking history. Serum concentrations of 57 cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from 43 patients with advanced NSCLC were evaluated by multiplex immunoassays and compared with serum samples from 35 patients with COPD. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and non-parametric analyses were performed. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. Clustering of cytokine and MMP concentrations in the serum revealed a distinct separation of the NSCLC patients from the COPD group. Individual concentrations of thymus and activation-regulated cytokine (C-C motif chemokine ligand 17), Gro-b (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2)), CXCL13, interleukin (IL)-1ra, IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-16, IL-17A, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, platelet-derived growth factor subunit B, MMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP-12 were significantly different in serum from NSCLC and COPD patients. Moreover, the interferon-Î³/IL-10 ratio was lower in cancer patients compared with COPD patients, consistent with a cytokine milieu favouring tumour tolerance. Our results suggest that NSCLC is characterised by a distinct inflammatory signature in serum. The different cytokine profiles in NSCLC and COPD patients may represent tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing immune responses developing in response to mucosal inflammation and mutations induced by smoking.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hanne Astrid Eide"", ids = ""39897460""); list(name = ""Ann Rita Halvorsen"", ids = ""34883903""); list(name = ""Vandana Sandhu"", ids = ""47373879""); list(name = ""Anne FÃ¥ne"", ids = ""49394033""); list(name = ""J.

f261662787cc1d240f838f84f410a4057edaba43,Gastric Cancer Cell Lines Have Different MYC-Regulated Expression Patterns but Share a Common Core of Altered Genes,"MYC is an oncogene responsible for excessive cell growth in cancer, enabling transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, metabolism, and apoptosis, and is usually overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC). By using siRNA and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), we identified MYC-regulated differentially expressed Genes (DEGs) in three Brazilian gastric cancer cell lines representing the histological subtypes of GC (diffuse, intestinal, and metastasis). The DEGs were picked using Sailfish software, followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis using KEGG. We found 11 significantly enriched gene sets by using enrichment score (ES), False Discovery Rate (FDR), and nominal P-values. We identified a total of 5.471 DEGs with correlation over (80%). In diffuse-type and in metastatic GC cell lines, MYC-silencing caused DEGs downregulation, while the intestinal-type GC cells presented overall DEGs upregulation after MYC siRNA depletion. We were able to detect 11 significant gene sets when comparing our samples to the hallmark collection of gene expression, enriched mostly for the following hallmarks: proliferation, pathway, signaling, metabolic, and DNA damage response. When we analyzed our DEGs considering KEGG metabolic pathways, we found 12 common branches covering a wide range of biological functions, and three of them were common to all three cell lines: ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, ribosomes, and system and epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection. The GC cell lines used in this study share 14 MYC-regulated genes, but their gene expression profile is different for each histological subtype of GC. Our results present a computational analysis of MYC-related signatures in GC, and we present evidence that GC cell lines representing distinct histological subtypes of this disease have different MYC-regulated expression profiles but share a common core of altered genes.

3e2ac52e15713ce30d61b755edb4f5c617e39bcc,ICan: An Optimized Ion-Current-Based Quantification Procedure with Enhanced Quantitative Accuracy and Sensitivity in Biomarker Discovery,"The rapidly expanding availability of high-resolution mass spectrometry has substantially enhanced the ion-current-based relative quantification techniques. Despite the increasing interest in ion-current-based methods, quantitative sensitivity, accuracy, and false discovery rate remain the major concerns; consequently, comprehensive evaluation and development in these regards are urgently needed. Here we describe an integrated, new procedure for data normalization and protein ratio estimation, termed ICan, for improved ion-current-based analysis of data generated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). ICan achieved significantly better accuracy and precision, and lower false-positive rate for discovering altered proteins, over current popular pipelines. A spiked-in experiment was used to evaluate the performance of ICan to detect small changes. In this study E. coli extracts were spiked with moderate-abundance proteins from human plasma (MAP, enriched by IgY14-SuperMix procedure) at two different levels to set a small change of 1.5-fold. Forty-five (92%, with an average ratio of 1.71 Â± 0.13) of 49 identified MAP protein (i.e., the true positives) and none of the reference proteins (1.0-fold) were determined as significantly altered proteins, with cutoff thresholds of â‰¥ 1.3-fold change and p â‰¤ 0.05. This is the first study to evaluate and prove competitive performance of the ion-current-based approach for assigning significance to proteins with small changes. By comparison, other methods showed remarkably inferior performance. ICan can be broadly applicable to reliable and sensitive proteomic survey of multiple biological samples with the use of high-resolution MS. Moreover, many key features evaluated and optimized here such as normalization, protein ratio determination, and statistical analyses are also valuable for data analysis by isotope-labeling methods.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chengjian Tu"", ids = ""5225459""); list(name = ""Quanhu Sheng"", ids = ""143872309""); list(name = ""Jun Li"", ids = ""40340633""); list(name = ""Xiaomeng Shen"", ids = ""7260125""); list(name = ""Ming Zhang"", ids = ""1720939""); list(name = ""Yu Shyr"", ids = ""80280201""); list(name = ""Jun Qu"", ids = ""144876347"")",72bc47269a1aea0c0a6cb504de81b4a4b2c8080c; 26fc554fc3aab6d486e76e7eb27c7606fb28b471; a778e46baff40e44815c205f82841465a37d0518; ef63fb2432283a23bc19caff97bb6f7db0abcecc; e8744e3f7096bd4981df62528ffe13016660da04; 8cfdbb1dcf444481bd129ac3e4dc42b8742e68b7; 35c803bca15300b27bdae3dab8b5d91592156846; 24e39b82686b9386e044f0acb529517cdda8d3a8,,Journal of Proteome Research,13,5888 - 5897

SNP-wise approach, the standard method for analyzing GWAS, tests each SNP individually. Then the P-values are adjusted for multiple testing. Multiple testing adjustment (purely based on p-values) is over-conservative and causes lack of power in many GWASs, due to insufficiently modelling the relationship among SNPs. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, which borrows information across SNPs by grouping SNPs into three clusters. We pre-specify the patterns of clusters by minor allele frequencies of SNPs between cases and controls, and enforce the patterns with prior distributions. Therefore, compared with the traditional approach, it better controls false discovery rate (FDR) and shows higher sensitivity, which is confirmed by our simulation studies. We re-analyzed real data studies on identifying SNPs associated with severe bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BiPN) in patients with multiple myeloma. The original analysis in the literature failed to identify SNPs after FDR adjustment. Our proposed method not only detected the reported SNPs after FDR adjustment but also discovered a novel SNP rs4351714 that has been reported to be related to multiple myeloma in another study.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Yan Xu"", ids = ""48615144""); list(name = ""Li Xing"", ids = ""48542067""); list(name = ""Jessica Su"", ids = ""145531163""); list(name = ""Xuekui Zhang"", ids = ""8443431""); list(name = ""Weiliang Qiu"", ids = ""145348216"")",,,,,
cd1201e064193ebc118a0a05e2eb35fa2c764e2f,Differentially expressed genes associated with Staphylococcus aureus mastitis in dairy goats.,"To study gene expression within the mammary glands of dairy goats with mastitis, mRNA was collected from milk somatic cells (MSCs) of left udder halves challenged with Staphylococcus aureus and right udder halves infused with PBS, as control, at different time points (0, 12, 24 and 48h post-infection). Transcriptional profiles were investigated using bovine cDNA microarrays; of the total 288 differentially expressed genes identified with ANOVA analysis (False Discovery Rate=0.05, 1.5-fold change), 26, 36 and 16 genes were down-regulated at 12, 24 and 48h post-infection, respectively, while 60, 141 and 9 genes were up-regulated at the same corresponding time points. The expression profiles clearly changed at 24h post-infection with 177 genes significantly altered, corresponding to a 10-fold increase of S. aureus bacterial count in milk from infected udders. Differential expression of selected genes (CD2BP2, BCAP31, MHCII, FOSL2, MAPK13, ILT5 and JUNB) was also confirmed by real-time PCR at the different time points considered, showing high correlation with the microarray measurements and high reliability of the microarray analyses. The most readily inducible classes of genes in caprine MSCs infected with S. aureus were pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and their receptors; IL-1alpha, lymphotoxin alpha, granulocyte chemotactic protein (CXCL6), and IL-2 receptor gamma were all up-regulated in infected udders versus healthy controls.

Even if there is no real change, the traditional p = 0.05 can cause 5% of the investigated tests being reported significant. Multiple testing corrections have been developed to solve this problem. Here the authors describe the one-step (Bonferroni), multi-s tep (step-down and step-up) and graphical methods. However, sometimes a correction for multip le testing creates more problems, than it solves: the universal null hypothesis is of little interest, the exact number of investigations to be adjusted for can not determined and the probabil ity of type II error increases. For these reasons the authors suggest not to perform multiple testing corrections routinely. The calculation of the false discovery rate is a new me thod for genome-wide studies. Here the p value is substituted by the q value, which also sho ws the level of significance. The q value belonging to a measurement is the proportion of fal se positive measurements when we accept it as significant. The authors propose using the q value instead of the p value in genome-wide studies.

704437e077ddece1a23a5a87870591d738058064,Significance Thresholds for Rare Variant Signals,"With the advent of large-scale DNA sequencing studies, it is worth considering how to estimate the required significance threshold for tests of association between the resulting genetic variation and a phenotype of interest. Due to the rarity of most of the identified variants, standard analytic practice now includes, in addition to single-variant tests, a new set of statistical tests that consider simultaneously all genetic variability in a small chosen region of the genome. However, the question of how to set appropriate genome-wide significance thresholds for these region-based tests has received little consideration. To control the family-wise error rate, estimates of the effective number of independent tests, me, are required. Although for single-variant tests, me depends primarily on the linkage disequilibrium, for region-based tests, the choice of regions, of weights, and of test statistics will also influence me. Therefore, me will need to be estimated for each analytic plan. In this chapter, we review a recently proposed method for using the patterns of correlation between test statistics to estimate the required significance thresholds. In this approach, extrapolation from small sections of the genome to the whole genome can provide computationally feasible estimators for genome-wide significance thresholds. We also discuss other factors that may need consideration, such as exome sequencing, the use of false discovery rates for controlling type 1 errors, and region definitions that are not based on physical proximity.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Celia M.

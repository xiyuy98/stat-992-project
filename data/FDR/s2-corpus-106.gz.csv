14836a398611803d5d96b210930adb5e19b5cd98,Sa65: Identifying Variants in Nf1a Gene to Be Associated with Seasonal Pattern and Susceptibility for Depression through a Candidate Gene Approach,"Background Seasonal Pattern (SP) was reported in depressive patients of both Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). In this study, we aimed to investigate genetic contributions of seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes in both BD and MDD patients, including genes in relevant biological pathways indicated in previous studies. To further clarify the roles of the variants in depression, we conducted analyses using a case-control study design to examine whether the genetic variants for SP also possess effects on susceptibility to depression. Methods We recruited 472 BD (83%) and MDD (17%) patients in Taiwan. SP of depressive episode were defined according to interview questions as â€œWhich season do you feel the worst?â€ in their first, the most serious, and the most recent episode within a year. Subjects answered a specific season in two of the three episode categories were considered SP+, while others were categorized as non-SP (SP-). The other dataset for depression was obtained from the Taiwan biobank with about 10,000 people. Cases were defined by self-report MDD history or having the sum-score greater than 3 in the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. We examined 15 genes (824 single nucleotide variants) including the melatonin pathway (MTNR1a, MTNR1b, AANAT), serotonin pathway (TPH2, HTR2A, HTR2B, SLC6A4), circadian feedback loop (NPAS2, CRY2, ARNTL, ARNTL2, RORA, RORB, PER) and NF1A gene that identified from a previous genome-wide association study of seasonal mania. Association analyses were performed by multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for gender, age, and diagnosis. We corrected for multiple testings using false discovery rate method. Results After excluding subjects with missing covariates, there were a total of 464 subjects with 162 (35%) in the SP+ and 302 (65%) in the SP- groups. No differences were observed in gender, age or diagnosis distribution between the two SP groups. Nominal associations with p-value The 20 markers were tested again for depression in 9862 individuals from Taiwan biobank. Although none of them showed genome-wide significance, 6 SNPs had nominal p-values Discussion We found that NF1A gene maybe a susceptible gene for depression and modifiable gene for SP. Some genetic variants in this gene are related to both seasonal pattern of depressive episodes and depression with nominal significance, indicating partially shared genetic components between the development of mood symptoms and seasonality in depression. Further investigation is needed for replication with more stringent seasonal pattern evaluation, and for exploring the exact biological functions of the identified genetic variants.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Teng-Yu Fan"", ids = ""121680230""); list(name = ""Ming-Chyi Huang"", ids = ""2853067""); list(name = ""Mong-Liang Lu"", ids = ""67188913""); list(name = ""Hsi-Chung Chen"", ids = ""3027924""); list(name = ""Po-Hsiu Kuo"", ids = ""145734798"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,29,s857-s858

The 46 most strongly associated signals (FDR of 25%) included a second region in a gene also previously linked to infertility, C9orf3, suggesting that our findings may in part capture the effect of parental subfertility. Using twin modelling, we observed that individual-specific environmental factors appear to be the main overall contributors of methylation variability at the FDR 25% IVF-associated differentially methylated regions, although evidence for methylation heritability was also obtained at several of these regions. We replicated previous findings of differential methylation associated with IVF at the H19/IGF2 region in cord blood mononuclear cells, and we validated the signal at C9orf3 in monozygotic twins. We also explored the impact of intracytoplasmic sperm injection on the FDR 25% signals for potential effects specific to male or female infertility factors.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of DNA methylation profiles at birth and IVF conception to date, and our results show evidence for epigenetic modifications that may in part reflect parental subfertility.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juan E.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). National Institute of Health (NIH) consensus criteria classification of GvHD has prognostic significance, with classic and overlap cGvHD showing better survival. Patients with classic and overlap cGvHD have clinical features mimicking autoimmune diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) have been associated with development of connective tissue disorders and autoimmune diseases. BAFF is a cytokine of the tumor necrosis factor family which plays an important role in both normal and post HCT B-cell homeostasis. Elevated BAFF to B-cell ratio after HCT can predict for the development of cGvHD. We hypothesized that recipient and/or donor BAFF SNPs would be associated with the phenotype of GvHD following HCT. Adult patients undergoing HCT (cord transplant excluded) at a single center (1999-2008), with a minimum survival of 120 days, and with the availability of pre-transplant recipient and donor germline DNA samples were included (n=164). GvHD was phenotyped per NIH criteria. Twenty tagSNPs of the BAFF gene were identified using previously published criteria. Genotyping was performed with the GoldenGate assay of the VeraCode technology using the BeadXpress reader system. P-values were generated using logistic regression and adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR). GvHD after day 100 occurred in 124 (76%) patients [delayed/recurrent acute GvHD (aGVHD) (n=23), overlap GvHD (n=29) and classic cGvHD (n=72)]. Patients with classic and overlap cGvHD had improved overall survival (OS) compared to patients with aGvHD and no GvHD (P=0.007). Due to shared clinical phenotype and similar survival characteristics, overlap and classic cGvHD were combined into a single outcome variable to test for association with BAFF SNPs. In univariate analyses, there were no differences in patient characteristics between classic/overlap vs. acute/no GvHD. Variables included in analysis were: age, gender, race, disease diagnoses, disease risk, stem cell source, regimen intensity, donor type, HLA match, GvHD prophylaxis, use of irradiation, CMV serostatus, aGVHD grade prior to day 100, bilirubin level and platelet count at day 100 post allo-SCT. In single SNP analyses 9 (donor-2, recipient-7) of the 20 tag SNPs had significant P values of <0.05 when comparing classic/overlap cGvHD vs. aGvHD/no GvHD. Remainder of the analyses were on recipient SNPs only. Adjusting for FDR, 4 recipient SNPs remained significant and included in multivariate analyses using classic chronic/overlap cGvHD as reference category. All 4 BAFF SNPs, rs16972217 [odds ratio (OR) 2.72, 95% CI 1.38 â€“5.39, P=0.004], rs7993590 [OR 2.35 95% CI 1.22â€“4.55,P=0.011], rs12428930 [OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.27â€“5.04, P=0.008] and rs2893321 [OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.25â€“4.92,P=0.009] were independent predictors of late/recurrent aGvHD or no aGVHD ([Figure][1]), adjusted for â€œconventionalâ€ predictors of cGvHD [donor status (related vs. unrelated), stem cell source (bone marrow vs. peripheral blood stem cells), and aGvHD prior to day 100 (grade 0â€“1 vs. 2â€“4)]. Our study is the first to show that genetic variation of BAFF can predict the phenotype of GvHD after HCT. None of the known clinical predictors of limited/extensive cGVHD were associated with classic or overlap cGvHD. Correlations of serum BAFF levels with BAFF SNPs are being studied. The ability of BAFF SNPs to predict efficacy of rituximab in prevention and treatment of cGVHD needs to be investigated to allow for an individualized approach in the management of GvHD.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is another neurovascular imaging technique but low cost, can be performed serially at the bedside, and may be combined with electroencephalography (EEG), which are important advantages compared to fMRI. Combined NIRSâ€“EEG, however, has never been evaluated for the assessment of neurovascular coupling and consciousness in acute brain injury. We explored resting-state oscillations in eight-channel NIRS oxyhemoglobin and eight-channel EEG band-power signals to assess neurovascular coupling, the prerequisite for neurovascular-based imaging detection of consciousness, in patients with acute brain injury in the ICU (nâ€‰=â€‰9). Conscious neurological patients from step-down units and wards served as controls (nâ€‰=â€‰14). Unsupervised adaptive mixture-independent component analysis (AMICA) was used to correlate NIRSâ€“EEG data with levels of consciousness and clinical outcome. Neurovascular coupling between NIRS oxyhemoglobin (0.07â€“0.13 Hz) and EEG band-power (1â€“12 Hz) signals at frontal areas was sensitive and prognostic to changing consciousness levels. AMICA revealed a mixture of five models from EEG data, with the relative probabilities of these models reflecting levels of consciousness over multiple days, although the accuracy was less than 85%. However, when combined with two channels of bilateral frontal neurovascular coupling, weighted k-nearest neighbor classification of AMICA probabilities distinguished unresponsive patients from conscious controls withâ€‰>â€‰90% accuracy (positive predictive value 93%, false discovery rate 7%) and, additionally, identified patients who subsequently failed to recover consciousness withâ€‰>â€‰99% accuracy.

a24b890fb3863998a8376630375e5325e669b291,TileMap: create chromosomal map of tiling array hybridizations,"MOTIVATION
Tiling array is a new type of microarray that can be used to survey genomic transcriptional activities and transcription factor binding sites at high resolution. The goal of this paper is to develop effective statistical tools to identify genomic loci that show transcriptional or protein binding patterns of interest.


RESULTS
A two-step approach is proposed and is implemented in TileMap. In the first step, a test-statistic is computed for each probe based on a hierarchical empirical Bayes model. In the second step, the test-statistics of probes within a genomic region are used to infer whether the region is of interest or not. Hierarchical empirical Bayes model shrinks variance estimates and increases sensitivity of the analysis. It allows complex multiple sample comparisons that are essential for the study of temporal and spatial patterns of hybridization across different experimental conditions. Neighboring probes are combined through a moving average method (MA) or a hidden Markov model (HMM). Unbalanced mixture subtraction is proposed to provide approximate estimates of false discovery rate for MA and model parameters for HMM.

b3dc348054bf7c8030669d9fa3ca39c15916aa12,Host Response to the Lung Microbiome in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"RATIONALE
The relatively sparse but diverse microbiome in human lungs may become less diverse in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This article examines the relationship of this microbiome to emphysematous tissue destruction, number of terminal bronchioles, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and host gene expression.


METHODS
Culture-independent pyrosequencing microbiome analysis was used to examine the V3-V5 regions of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA in 40 samples of lung from 5 patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage 4) and 28 samples from 4 donors (controls). A second protocol based on the V1-V3 regions was used to verify the bacterial microbiome results. Within lung tissue samples the microbiome was compared with results of micro-computed tomography, infiltrating inflammatory cells measured by quantitative histology, and host gene expression.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Ten operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found sufficient to discriminate between control and GOLD stage 4 lung tissue, which included known pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae. We also observed a decline in microbial diversity that was associated with emphysematous destruction, remodeling of the bronchiolar and alveolar tissue, and the infiltration of the tissue by CD4(+) T cells. Specific OTUs were also associated with neutrophils, eosinophils, and B-cell infiltration (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The expression profiles of 859 genes and 235 genes were associated with either enrichment or reductions of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, respectively, at a false discovery rate cutoff of less than 0.1.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support the hypothesis that there is a host immune response to microorganisms within the lung microbiome that appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marc A Sze"", ids = ""5649926""); list(name = ""Pedro A.

2057b48fd24fc1378c3df8eaaa99ab0860010704,Genome-wide analysis of miRNA and mRNA transcriptomes during amelogenesis,"BackgroundIn the rodent incisor during amelogenesis, as ameloblast cells transition from secretory stage to maturation stage, their morphology and transcriptome profiles change dramatically. Prior whole genome transcriptome analysis has given a broad picture of the molecular activities dominating both stages of amelogenesis, but this type of analysis has not included miRNA transcript profiling. In this study, we set out to document which miRNAs and corresponding target genes change significantly as ameloblasts transition from secretory- to maturation-stage amelogenesis.ResultsTotal RNA samples from both secretory- and maturation-stage rat enamel organs were subjected to genome-wide miRNA and mRNA transcript profiling. We identified 59 miRNAs that were differentially expressed at the maturation stage relative to the secretory stage of enamel development (False Discovery Rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05, fold change (FC)â€‰â‰¥â€‰1.8). In parallel, transcriptome profiling experiments identified 1,729 mRNA transcripts that were differentially expressed in the maturation stage compared to the secretory stage (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05, FC â‰¥1.8). Based on bioinformatics analyses, 5.8% (629 total) of these differentially expressed genes (DEGS) were highlighted as being the potential targets of 59 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in the opposite direction, in the same tissue samples. Although the number of predicted target DEGs was not higher than baseline expectations generated by examination of stably expressed miRNAs, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that these 629 DEGS were enriched for ion transport, pH regulation, calcium handling, endocytotic, and apoptotic activities. Seven differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-21, miR-31, miR-488, miR-153, miR-135b, miR-135a and miR298) in secretory- and/or maturation-stage enamel organs were confirmed by in situ hybridization. Further, we used luciferase reporter assays to provide evidence that two of these differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-153 and miR-31, are potential regulators for their predicated target mRNAs, Lamp1 (miR-153) and Tfrc (miR-31).ConclusionsIn conclusion, these data indicate that miRNAs exhibit a dynamic expression pattern during the transition from secretory-stage to maturation-stage tooth enamel formation.

7b0b636c6ab7d848965ae09c951f07d07a8c983e,Identification of metabolism pathways directly regulated by sigma54 factor in Bacillus thuringiensis,"Sigma(54) (Ïƒ(54)) regulates nitrogen and carbon utilization in bacteria. Promoters that are Ïƒ(54)-dependent are highly conserved and contain short sequences located at the -24 and -12 positions upstream of the transcription initiation site. Ïƒ(54) requires regulatory proteins known as bacterial enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) to activate gene transcription. We show that Ïƒ(54) regulates the capacity to grow on various nitrogen sources using a Bacillus thuringiensis HD73 mutant lacking the sigL gene encoding Ïƒ(54) (Î”sigL). A 2-fold-change cutoff and a false discovery rate cutoff of P < 0.05 were used to analyze the DNA microarray data, which revealed 255 genes that were downregulated and 121 that were upregulated in the Î”sigL mutant relative to the wild-type HD73 strain. The Ïƒ(54) regulon (stationary phase) was characterized by DNA microarray, bioinformatics, and functional assay; 16 operons containing 47 genes were identified whose promoter regions contain the conserved -12/-24 element and whose transcriptional activities were abolished or reduced in the Î”sigL mutant. Eight Ïƒ(54)-dependent transcriptional bEBPs were found in the Bt HD73 genome, and they regulated nine Ïƒ(54)-dependent promoters. The metabolic pathways activated by Ïƒ(54) in this process have yet to be identified in Bacillus thuringiensis; nonetheless, the present analysis of the Ïƒ(54) regulon provides a better understanding of the physiological roles of Ïƒ factors in bacteria.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qi Peng"", ids = ""122939216""); list(name = ""Guannan Wang"", ids = ""48738083""); list(name = ""Guiming Liu"", ids = ""1952190""); list(name = ""Jie Zhang"", ids = ""49050330""); list(name = ""Fuping Song"", ids = ""8140901"")",6c280a24cfbd53b89fee410aede3676ad39db468; f03cf3b1de905aebbde3d66de0b6e719a23e3ebe; 6d9c658b7a25ee159b968ef6ce0515ff23dfd235; 80d817a78013bc4706ff202abbc63d2eb8f4379c; f76dd4ec2a47a0027e7ef45769f2959fc80e3dd6; f33a9d43a9775d2c4569beb5496a2467d12b9e47,e84381b3a09d776576a02061bcb3e70f83a29a31; 2714e4d1b97a2052d74105a54f30f2b6ee9f0957; ba87a5f5844abf1e5c194bc957d8e8cfa762d6d6; 15fe9bcbbee6ad20d4cde6d68c5bff2c5a289d70; ba756c21994e050ad4eaf30fdae27888d76ac4b7; f428670262413dca496f80c1b22ccd2724e5a899; 8d850902ab54604d96e8ef4cad7686f199c2f159; b8f2ad0da6d9b4d6d97e6dbb19ba6cb27ebb8ef2; 0e733d617c51627aefc5405046add57ae5dace81; 109da45126c8a5528043d40af84c2920d79635a5; 78a47c832b16c78fadf29d0354e690f01ab90244; 2039f64bd8eb89f6a7730126777bb287b2f9fcfb; af088b6f53a5a911f7d4138dd92630a45f676436; 6b35b27591054a5ece97826430f63c3f60a79222; 16dabd1168fa7e5a5ece8a521a7476f6cd258ce0; eaae9e4d89119d59948262f30e990e2f894acacf; 2c7e222f5d9cca80ae6b3f8683295e4f90f4c221; cc2db611b339fd9f56955a6f5e6dbb8ff2b7e04b; f555f832e515a68c2a4969894e81f72ca14630a6; 15ec32a37ab178e8ac83c9818e8e59887a0b9538; 2ebdd00f5c41123414f2cc7cb2007c868696d6d8; dd9c8eeb80c29e062d3c0ce5a6fc94fea13e0af5; 2914cb3f029ad89d60f7f16993432a60567a4b2b; 4cf581147dbffe9d4a25ba74abbe6a44a27a9360; 3a5597bffc3bcf744facc933364931b5b3b5de37; c9648168ffb08a91911eae40455d20b3172d3d2e; a6be7a96e29399afd01df094089d8583cf8fb2c6; 9f2dccef20411b8b8688dc1ade39975f03e74189; bcad83f07a1071a1ec28b539f2e9a405e875a7b3; 80246d91bb7d9720354b9386ac75d1271de6d30f; 6cb7e95acd6b6118fa72bfb178b5037e2edf9dec; 3f299a278d0542f33337534f22bc1943b5484dff; 8456831e726ba91b2a2df1df4c8eb6af1a4c6546; 8930f46a917eaf015dc4550381df6c4c2589c4d1; 703c128091da16930f88d00d124c6cf777159cc3; f35310967f2876b769de5dbe2ca4b0f8e950563b; 63fef40a66ac5f7d67983d609b584ca989a6cdbc; af07388d665a406a33bed2a330bff27a8eb65ca9; 3fda0d09033befc0652bc06adb75f5215c26473c; 93d1b4b88cbd87ed75a28b3f3ae28eadf4998110; f07ce423c89e90c4cfb0890ee00e5e48a4a129c7; 2c4072c581d296b178a2ab8e209633ccd2c69d89; f8a68bc714d7dd62a1638bfc7ee5a300c4a4ab1c; dce8a68bc58ece1baf022e3a32d2d7d0c6ebc028; aee3d2d3195ad231413ca9c208c30236bf4d2130; a8be12182cca7c73ed9aceee0278c151d78a1826; 680de2623c70de72442881bdeae0868019f4868e; fa3c08176bebecf66766acaf4bf40165c68821f5; bd0341a4fe1a812fbf137fa971558cf12f41b6ec; 4b63b41345e0e5769862a472d1d06352a6e6b4ef; cf645b852c1e5610413190901de5152ebd073f3c; 890b246e84fb0d70790c3299667149ac515ec08c; 9bd22e683403da2dd72772b15296bf7fec136676,Frontiers in Microbiology,6,
1983ae6e8f4ebd9a441c2fa430ddd8ef410cd0e1,Pathway analysis of genetic variants in folateâ€mediated oneâ€carbon metabolismâ€related genes and survival in a prospectively followed cohort of colorectal cancer patients,"Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) is a key pathway essential for nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, and repair. This pathway is a critical target for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is predominantly used for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. A comprehensive assessment of polymorphisms in FOCM-related genes and their association with prognosis has not yet been performed. Within 1,739 CRC cases aged â‰¥30Â years diagnosed from 2003 to 2007 (DACHS study), we investigated 397 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 50 candidates in 48 FOCM-related genes for associations with overall- (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using multiple Cox regression (adjusted for age, sex, stage, grade, BMI, and alcohol). We investigated effect modification by 5-FU-based chemotherapy and assessed pathway-specific effects. Correction for multiple testing was performed using false discovery rates (FDR). After a median follow-up time of 5.0Â years, 585 patients were deceased. For one candidate SNP in MTHFR and two in TYMS, we observed significant inverse associations with OS (MTHFR: rs1801133, C677T: HRhet Â =Â 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97; TYMS: rs1001761: HRhet Â =Â 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99 and rs2847149: HRhet Â =Â 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99). After FDR correction, one polymorphism in paraoxonase 1 (PON1; rs3917538) was significantly associated with OS (HRhet Â =Â 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07-1.53; HRhzv Â =Â 2.02, 95% CI:1.46-2.80; HRlogAdd Â =Â 1.31, pFDR Â =Â 0.01). Adjusted pathway analyses showed significant associations for pyrimidine biosynthesis (PÂ =Â 0.04) and fluorouracil drug metabolism (PÂ <Â 0.01) with significant gene-chemotherapy interactions, including PON1 rs3917538. This study supports the concept that FOCM-related genes could be associated with CRC survival and may modify effects of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in genes in pyrimidine and fluorouracil metabolism, which are relevant targets for therapeutic response and prognosis in CRC. These results require confirmation in additional clinical studies.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer Ose"", ids = ""4791037""); list(name = ""Akke Botma"", ids = ""117398336""); list(name = ""Yesilda Balavarca"", ids = ""4738668""); list(name = ""Katharina Buck"", ids = ""4536912""); list(name = ""Dominique Scherer"", ids = ""2669406""); list(name = ""Nina Habermann"", ids = ""47575611""); list(name = ""Jolantha Beyerle"", ids = ""12558938""); list(name = ""Katrin Pfuetze"", ids = ""49142389""); list(name = ""Petra Seibold"", ids = ""5836100""); list(name = ""Elisabeth J.

The current peak detection procedure in SPM12 requires a pre-threshold for approximating p-values and a false discovery rate (FDR) nominal level for inference. However, the pre-threshold is an undesirable feature, while the FDR level is meaningless if the null hypothesis is not properly defined. This article provides: 1) a peak height distribution for smooth Gaussian error fields, which does not require a screening pre-threshold; 2) a signal-plus-noise model where FDR of peaks can be controlled and properly interpreted. Matlab code for calculation of p-values using the exact peak height distribution is available as an SPM extension.",2019,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Armin Schwartzman"", ids = ""153500444""); list(name = ""Fabian J.E.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting about 5 million people worldwide with no disease-modifying therapies. We sought blood-based biomarkers in order to provide molecular characterization of individuals with PD for diagnostic confirmation and prediction of progression.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
In 141 plasma samples (96 PD, 45 neurologically normal control [NC] individuals; 45.4% female, mean age 70.0 years) from a longitudinally followed Discovery Cohort based at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), we measured levels of 1,129 proteins using an aptamer-based platform. We modeled protein plasma concentration (log10 of relative fluorescence units [RFUs]) as the effect of treatment group (PD versus NC), age at plasma collection, sex, and the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), deriving first-pass candidate protein biomarkers based on p-value for PD versus NC. These candidate proteins were then ranked by Stability Selection. We confirmed findings from our Discovery Cohort in a Replication Cohort of 317 individuals (215 PD, 102 NC; 47.9% female, mean age 66.7 years) from the multisite, longitudinally followed National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) Cohort. Analytical approach in the Replication Cohort mirrored the approach in the Discovery Cohort: each protein plasma concentration (log10 of RFU) was modeled as the effect of group (PD versus NC), age at plasma collection, sex, clinical site, and batch. Of the top 10 proteins from the Discovery Cohort ranked by Stability Selection, four associations were replicated in the Replication Cohort. These blood-based biomarkers were bone sialoprotein (BSP, Discovery false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected p = 2.82 Ã— 10-2, Replication FDR-corrected p = 1.03 Ã— 10-4), osteomodulin (OMD, Discovery FDR-corrected p = 2.14 Ã— 10-2, Replication FDR-corrected p = 9.14 Ã— 10-5), aminoacylase-1 (ACY1, Discovery FDR-corrected p = 1.86 Ã— 10-3, Replication FDR-corrected p = 2.18 Ã— 10-2), and growth hormone receptor (GHR, Discovery FDR-corrected p = 3.49 Ã— 10-4, Replication FDR-corrected p = 2.97 Ã— 10-3). Measures of these proteins were not significantly affected by differences in sample handling, and they did not change comparing plasma samples from 10 PD participants sampled both on versus off dopaminergic medication. Plasma measures of OMD, ACY1, and GHR differed in PD versus NC but did not differ between individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 59) versus NC. In the Discovery Cohort, individuals with baseline levels of GHR and ACY1 in the lowest tertile were more likely to progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in Cox proportional hazards analyses adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration (hazard ratio [HR] 2.27 [95% CI 1.04-5.0, p = 0.04] for GHR, and HR 3.0 [95% CI 1.24-7.0, p = 0.014] for ACY1). GHR's association with cognitive decline was confirmed in the Replication Cohort (HR 3.6 [95% CI 1.20-11.1, p = 0.02]). The main limitations of this study were its reliance on the aptamer-based platform for protein measurement and limited follow-up time available for some cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we found that the blood-based biomarkers BSP, OMD, ACY1, and GHR robustly associated with PD across multiple clinical sites. Our findings suggest that biomarkers based on a peripheral blood sample may be developed for both disease characterization and prediction of future disease progression in PD.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marijan Posavi"", ids = ""47181648""); list(name = ""Maria Diaz-Ortiz"", ids = ""1413417609""); list(name = ""Benjamine Liu"", ids = ""1390956970""); list(name = ""Christine R.

The objective of this study was to identify aberrantly reprogrammed transcripts by performing transcriptional profiling between in vivo (IVV), nuclear transfer (NT) blastocyst stage embryos and the donor cell line (cells). This was followed by measuring HDAC activity (Epigentek) in zygotes and by real-time PCR on a selected subset of genes at the blastocyst stage to determine if Scriptaid treatment (NTS) corrected the aberrant gene expression. NTS embryos were treated with 500â€‰nM Scriptaid for 14â€‰h after activation. NT and NTS embryos were transferred into gilts on Day 0 or 1 of oestrus and collected 6 days later by uterine flush. IVV samples were collected on Day 8 of gestation. 3 pools of 10 to 15 embryos and cells were collected for each treatment and analysed twice. For transcriptional profiling, total RNA was isolated by using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), amplified by using an Ovation Ribo-SPIA linear amplification kit (Nugen), labelled with Cy5 and compared to reference labelled with Cy3. Lowess normalization and analysis was performed in Genespring 7.3.1. ANOVA was performed with the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate. Transcripts that were different between IVV and NT (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.20) and significantly different from the donor cell line (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05) were classified as being aberrantly reprogrammed. This comparison resulted in 119 under- and 60 over-compensated transcripts. Functional annotation classification was performed in DAVID and identified under-compensated pathways (oxidative phosphorylation and protein biosynthesis) and over-compensated pathways (chromatin packaging/remodelling and protein complex assembly). Fourteen transcripts were chosen for real-time PCR validation and evaluation of the effect of Scriptaid. Relative gene expression was compared between IVV, NT, NTS, and cells by the comparative Ct method with SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) by using a least significant difference test (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). NTS embryos had 3 transcripts returning to the same level as IVV (H3F3A, CAPG, and SEPT7). The level of the majority of the transcripts (8/14) was not affected by NTS treatment, e.g. histone deacetylase SIRT1 and H1 histone, member 0 (H1F0). However, Scriptaid treatment caused COX5A to be further over compensated in NTS with expression levels higher than IVV and NT. 2 transcripts had expression levels that were lower in NTS compared to both IVV and NT including GPD1L and EIF3E. Scriptaid treatment significantly affected gene expression in 6 of the 14 transcripts evaluated. Scriptaid treatment of the reconstructed zygotes did not affect the majority of the transcripts when measured at the blastocyst stage. HDAC activity was significantly reduced in NTS compared to NT 1-cell stage embryos (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.038). While Scriptaid reduced HDAC activity, it returned only a few genes to normal IVV levels.

847f5f7e6e8112b7fa16a50fbfe99d24d9d59510,Relative Quantification and Higher-Order Modeling of the Plasma Glycan Cancer Burden Ratio in Ovarian Cancer Case-Control Samples.,"An early-stage, population-wide biomarker for ovarian cancer (OVC) is essential to reverse its high mortality rate. Aberrant glycosylation by OVC has been reported, but studies have yet to identify an N-glycan with sufficiently high specificity. We curated a human biorepository of 82 case-control plasma samples, with 27%, 12%, 46%, and 15% falling across stages I-IV, respectively. For relative quantitation, glycans were analyzed by the individuality normalization when labeling with glycan hydrazide tags (INLIGHT) strategy for enhanced electrospray ionization, MS/MS analysis. Sixty-three glycan cancer burden ratios (GBRs), defined as the log10 ratio of the case-control extracted ion chromatogram abundances, were calculated above the limit of detection. The final GBR models, built using stepwise forward regression, included three significant terms: OVC stage, normalized mean GBR, and tag chemical purity; glycan class, fucosylation, or sialylation were not significant variables. After Bonferroni correction, seven N-glycans were identified as significant (p < 0.05), and after false discovery rate correction, an additional four glycans were determined to be significant (p < 0.05), with one borderline (p = 0.05). For all N-glycans, the vectors of the effects from stages II-IV were sequentially reversed, suggesting potential biological changes in OVC morphology or in host response.",2015,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Sara Hecht"", ids = ""46510528""); list(name = ""Elizabeth H.

fe11d5bed42567f28b282e2da8e79b458e7eb815,Estimating p-values in small microarray experiments,"MOTIVATION
Microarray data typically have small numbers of observations per gene, which can result in low power for statistical tests. Test statistics that borrow information from data across all of the genes can improve power, but these statistics have non-standard distributions, and their significance must be assessed using permutation analysis. When sample sizes are small, the number of distinct permutations can be severely limited, and pooling the permutation-derived test statistics across all genes has been proposed. However, the null distribution of the test statistics under permutation is not the same for equally and differentially expressed genes. This can have a negative impact on both p-value estimation and the power of information borrowing statistics.


RESULTS
We investigate permutation based methods for estimating p-values. One of methods that uses pooling from a selected subset of the data are shown to have the correct type I error rate and to provide accurate estimates of the false discovery rate (FDR). We provide guidelines to select an appropriate subset. We also demonstrate that information borrowing statistics have substantially increased power compared to the t-test in small experiments.",2007,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyuna Yang"", ids = ""2079297""); list(name = ""Gary A.

e8c6a9f112d6cdd8ac5f4fc5c3b9254cd007fdf2,Association between the candidate susceptibility gene ACVR2A on chromosome 2q22 and pre-eclampsia in a large Norwegian population-based study (the HUNT study),"Genome-wide scans in Icelandic, Australian/New Zealand and Finnish pedigrees have provided evidence for maternal susceptibility loci for pre-eclampsia on chromosome 2, although at different positions (Iceland: 2p13 and 2q23, Australia/New Zealand: 2p11â€“12 and 2q22, Finland: 2p25). In this project, a large population-based (n=65â€‰000) nested caseâ€“control study was performed in Norway to further explore the association between positional candidate genes on chromosome 2q and pre-eclampsia, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). DNA samples from 1139 cases (women with one or more pre-eclamptic pregnancies) and 2269 controls (women with normal pregnancies) were genotyped using the Applied Biosystems SNPlex high-throughput genotyping assay. In total, 71 SNPs within positional candidate genes at 2q22â€“23 locus on chromosome 2 were genotyped in each individual. Genotype data were statistically analysed with the sequential oligogenic linkage analysis routines (SOLAR) computer package. Nominal evidence of association was found for six SNPs (rs1014064, rs17742134, rs1424941, rs2161983, rs3768687 and rs3764955) within the activin receptor type 2 gene (ACVR2A) (all P-values <0.05). The non-independence of statistical tests due to linkage disequilibrium between SNPs at a false discovery rate of 5% identifies our four best SNPs (rs1424941, rs1014064, rs2161983 and rs3768687) to remain statistically significant.

05c82a1de2705388dc1343dd3f765b8e32c37ba2,Selection of differentially expressed genes in microarray data analysis,"One common objective in microarray experiments is to identify a subset of genes that express differentially among different experimental conditions, for example, between drug treatment and no drug treatment. Often, the goal is to determine the underlying relationship between poor versus good gene signatures for identifying biological functions or predicting specific therapeutic outcomes. Because of the complexity in studying hundreds or thousands of genes in an experiment, selection of a subset of genes to enhance relationships among the underlying biological structures or to improve prediction accuracy of clinical outcomes has been an important issue in microarray data analysis. Selection of differentially expressed genes is a two-step process. The first step is to select an appropriate test statistic and compute the P-value. The genes are ranked according to their P-values as evidence of differential expression. The second step is to assign a significance level, that is, to determine a cutoff threshold from the P-values in accordance with the study objective. In this paper, we consider four commonly used statistics, t-, S- (SAM), U-(Mannâ€“Whitney) and M-statistics to compute the P-values for gene ranking. We consider the family-wise error and false discovery rate false-positive error-controlled procedures to select a limited number of genes, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) approach to select a larger number of genes for assigning the significance level. The ROC approach is particularly useful in genomic/genetic profiling studies. The well-known colon cancer data containing 22 normal and 40 tumor tissues are used to illustrate different gene ranking and significance level assignment methods for applications to genomic/genetic profiling studies. The P-values computed from the t-, U- and M-statistics are very similar. We discuss the common practice that uses the P-value, false-positive error probability, as the primary criterion, and then uses the fold-change as a surrogate measure of biological significance for gene selection. The P-value and the fold-change can be pictorially shown simultaneously in a volcano plot. We also address several issues on gene selection.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""James J.

894aa5e3d522d59bc9ffd30668a1ba92a2765527,Association between sigma-1 receptor gene polymorphism and prefrontal hemodynamic response induced by cognitive activation in schizophrenia,"The molecular biological role of the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) has attracted much attention. Evidence suggests that the Sig-1R engaged in modulating NMDA and dopamine receptors is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the mechanism of psychotropic drug efficacy. However, whether the Sig-1R genotype affects brain function in schizophrenia in vivo remains unknown. We investigated the association between Sig-1R functional polymorphism (Gln2Pro) and brain function in schizophrenia. The subjects were 40 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy controls, all right-handed, who gave written informed consent to participate. Signals, detected from prefrontal regions by 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during cognitive activation, were compared between two Sig1-R genotype subgroups (Gln/Gln individuals and Pro carriers) matched for age, gender, premorbid IQ and task performance. The prefrontal hemodynamic response of healthy controls during the verbal fluency task was higher than that of patients with schizophrenia. For the patients with schizophrenia, even after controlling the effect of medication, the [oxy-Hb] increase in the prefrontal cortex of the Gln/Gln genotype group was significantly greater than that of the Pro carriers (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05). Clinical symptoms were not significantly different between the two Sig-1R genotype subgroups. These differences were not significant in the healthy controls. This is the first functional imaging genetics study that implicated the association between Sig-1R genotype and prefrontal cortical function in schizophrenia in vivo. Our findings also suggest that the prefrontal hemodynamic response assessed by noninvasive and less demanding NIRS is a useful intermediate phenotype for translational research in schizophrenia.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ryu Takizawa"", ids = ""2458276""); list(name = ""Kenji Hashimoto"", ids = ""1751840""); list(name = ""Mamoru Tochigi"", ids = ""2935604""); list(name = ""Yuki Kawakubo"", ids = ""47620552""); list(name = ""Kiyoto Kasai"", ids = ""2099925"")",ce3092dcf2d03de995af19b79951f28561777826; 583201bf370525cecabda87bfcad5a1d591fe08b; 400ce54cbc20ac1355a961553eb67989196016d0; 66023714cd70d736d168bf04c15658b6686674a9; 6b9b76262d7f277ba295fd59758ce5684dc6eb76; 66692cc50a878d5ed544cfb54903ec7acbef0fe9; d3c4afb3e8902bc087155b9407eaf3f2f37ed0da; 7ef0fff57e01ec87416f0d1707065df25ab3e255; d5c5932dea6818355102c7340be0f99b4afcbe44; 39a6298e140cf678b925246a43401653cc5bef84; 8b5090cccfb52bc03ce1d879c68fc16333ffa8ec; e36517d5c7890ee2f1d9b647dde1c09ec0a8b6df; 2c9df026ac253bc332234c25f1ea2f5feb0b8fa9; d4490b51fd6e7f525a435c8de32a6225de8ab6a7,,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,33,491-498
bb1253adb11687da327fdf588cc79d6b290a41b0,A multiple testing procedure for multi-dimensional pairwise comparisons with application to gene expression studies,"BackgroundOften researchers are interested in comparing multiple experimental groups (e.g. tumor size) with a reference group (e.g. normal tissue) on the basis of thousands of features (e.g. genes) and determine if a differentially expressed feature is up or down regulated in a pairwise comparison. There are two sources of false discoveries, one due to multiple testing involving several pairwise comparisons and the second due to falsely declaring a feature to be up (or down) regulated when it is not (known as directional error). Together, the total error rate is called the mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR).ResultsWe develop a general powerful mdFDR controlling testing procedure and illustrate the methodology by analyzing uterine fibroid gene expression data (PLoS ONE 8:63909, 2013). We identify several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways that are specifically enriched according to the size of a uterine fibroid.ConclusionsThe proposed general procedure strongly controls mdFDR. Several specific methodologies can be derived from this general methodology by using appropriate testing procedures at different steps of the general procedure. Thus we are providing a general framework for making multiple pairwise comparisons. Our analysis of the uterine fibroid growth gene expression data suggests that molecular characteristics of a fibroid changes with size. Our powerful methodology allowed us to draw several interesting conclusions regarding the molecular characteristics of uterine fibroids. For example, IL-1 signaling pathway (Sci STKE 2003:3, 2003), associated with inflammation and known to activate prostaglandins that are implicated in the progression of fibroids, is significantly enriched only in small tumors (volume < 5.7 cm3).

9b2719331d2641538256d4cc55e3ab99915e0e52,Abstract 5332: MicroRNA profile of triple-negative breast cancer and prognosis.,"Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, estrogen receptor [ER]-, progesterone receptor [PR]-, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) is often aggressive and lack molecular targets for therapy. As gene regulators, microRNAs (miRNA) are important in cancer etiology but their utility as tumor biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis is yet unclear. Methods: To characterize the differential expression pattern of miRNA in TNBC from non-TNBC, we performed a whole miRNome profiling using TaqMan based quantitative PCR array of 754 miRNAs constructed based on miRBase 19 (Life Technologies, CA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen breast tumors and only RNA samples with good quality were included in the array experiment. Rigorous post-experiment quality controls were further conducted to remove unreliable plates. Moderate t-test was used to identify TNBC-specific miRNAs and Cox proportional hazard model was used to explore miRNAs that predict progression-free survival. Benjamini and Hochberg9s false discovery rate method was used to correct for multiple testing. Results: Samples from 85 patients were included in the final analysis, including 71 Caucasians, 7 African Americans, and 7 others. The average age (Â±SD) was 54.9 Â± 9.1 years. 17 patients had stage 1 tumor, 30 stage 2A, 26 stage 2B, 7 stage 3A, and 5 stage 3B. There were 42 samples with ER+, 37 PR+, 25 HER2+, and 25 categorized as TNBC. 363 out of 754 miRNAs showed expression in at least half of the samples and were included for further analysis. Of the 363 miRNAs, we found 98 to be significantly different between TNBC and non-TNBC after multiple testing correction. The most significant miRNA (miR-190b) was down-regulated in TNBC by about 20-fold (p=1.6x10-9). In fact, most of these miRNAs are down-regulated in TNBC compared to non-TNBC. During a median follow-up of 10.9 years, 29 patients died and 7 patients survived but had progressive disease of breast cancer. After multiple testing correction, we found 6 miRNAs showing significant association with progression-free survival. Interestingly, none of these 6 miRNAs were related to TNBC, suggesting that their prognostic value is independent of breast cancer subtypes. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the existence of a set of miRNAs specific to TNBC, which has a clear â€œfingerprintâ€ to differentiate TNBC from non-TNBC. We also identified different set of miRNAs that could serve as prognostic markers. Despite the small sample set, our results promisingly indicate the potential of miRNA as diagnostic and prognostic tool for breast cancer. A replication study with larger sample size would be in order. Citation Format: Toshio F. Yoshimatsu, Katharine Yao, Karen Kaul, Mary A. Turk, Olufunmilayo I. Olopade, Dezheng Huo.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of malignant melanoma progression and metastasis, gene expression profiling was done of primary melanomas and melanoma metastases.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Tumor cell-specific gene expression in 19 primary melanomas and 22 melanoma metastases was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays after laser-capture microdissection of melanoma cells. Statistical analysis was done by random permutation analysis and support vector machines. Microarray data were further validated by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.


RESULTS
Overall, 308 genes were identified that showed significant differential expression between primary melanomas and melanoma metastases (false discovery rate<or=0.05). Significantly overrepresented gene ontology categories in the list of 308 genes were cell cycle regulation, mitosis, cell communication, and cell adhesion. Overall, 47 genes showed up-regulation in metastases. These included Cdc6, Cdk1, septin 6, mitosin, kinesin family member 2C, osteopontin, and fibronectin. Down-regulated genes included E-cadherin, fibroblast growth factor binding protein, and desmocollin 1 and desmocollin 3, stratifin/14-3-3sigma, and the chemokine CCL27. Using support vector machine analysis of gene expression data, a performance of >85% correct classifications for primary melanomas and metastases was reached. Further analysis showed that subtypes of primary melanomas displayed characteristic gene expression patterns, as do thin tumors (<or=1.0 mm Breslow thickness) compared with intermediate and thick tumors (>2.0 mm Breslow thickness).


CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, this large-scale gene expression study of malignant melanoma identified molecular signatures related to metastasis, melanoma subtypes, and tumor thickness. These findings not only provide deeper insights into the pathogenesis of melanoma progression but may also guide future research on innovative treatments.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jochen Jaeger"", ids = ""40287269""); list(name = ""Dirk Koczan"", ids = ""3007917""); list(name = ""Hans-JÃ¼rgen Thiesen"", ids = ""3256988""); list(name = ""Saleh M.

468f17f9c8406903d0688f0c719298b221df2f31,A comparison of multiple testing adjustment methods with block-correlation positively-dependent tests,"In high dimensional data analysis (such as gene expression, spatial epidemiology, or brain imaging studies), we often test thousands or more hypotheses simultaneously. As the number of tests increases, the chance of observing some statistically significant tests is very high even when all null hypotheses are true. Consequently, we could reach incorrect conclusions regarding the hypotheses. Researchers frequently use multiplicity adjustment methods to control type I error rates-primarily the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR)-while still desiring high statistical power. In practice, such studies may have dependent test statistics (or p-values) as tests can be dependent on each other. However, some commonly-used multiplicity adjustment methods assume independent tests. We perform a simulation study comparing several of the most common adjustment methods involved in multiple hypothesis testing, under varying degrees of block-correlation positive dependence among tests.",2017,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""John R.

1aa9dcc67078085fe3269efb9828456a50cd696f,Runs of homozygosity and inbreeding in thyroid cancer,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing the risk of thyroid cancer (TC). Most cancer predisposition genes identified through GWASs function in a co-dominant manner, and studies have not found evidence for recessively functioning disease loci in TC. Our study examines whether homozygosity is associated with an increased risk of TC and searches for novel recessively acting disease loci.MethodsData from a previously conducted GWAS were used for the estimation of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all common SNPs, the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and the determination of inbreeding to unravel their influence on TC.ResultsInbreeding coefficients were significantly higher among cases than controls. Association on a SNP-by-SNP basis was controlled by using the false discovery rate at a level of q*â€‰<â€‰0.05, with 34 SNPs representing true differences in homozygosity between cases and controls. The average size, the number and total length of ROHs per person were significantly higher in cases than in controls. A total of 16 recurrent ROHs of rather short length were identified although their association with TC risk was not significant at a genome-wide level. Several recurrent ROHs harbor genes associated with risk of TC. All of the ROHs showed significant evidence for natural selection (iHS, Fst, Fay and Wuâ€™s H).ConclusionsOur results support the existence of recessive alleles in TC susceptibility. Although regions of homozygosity were rather small, it might be possible that variants within these ROHs affect TC risk and may function in a recessive manner.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hauke Thomsen"", ids = ""48494766""); list(name = ""Bowang Chen"", ids = ""1715113""); list(name = ""Gisella Figlioli"", ids = ""6141815""); list(name = ""R.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within HLA class II gene were associated with different clinical outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Three HLA class II SNPs (rs3077, rs2395309 and rs2856718) were genotyped by TaqMan assay among Chinese population, including 350 persistent HCV infection patients, 194 spontaneous viral clearance subjects and 973 HCV-uninfected control subjects. After logistic regression analysis, the results indicated that the rs2856718 TC genotype was significantly associated with the protective effect of the HCV natural susceptibility (adjusted OR: 0.712, 95% CI: 0.554-0.914) when compared with reference TT genotype, and this remained significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (p = 0.024). Moreover, the protective effect of rs2856718 was observed in dominant genetic models (adjusted OR: 0.726, 95% CI: 0.574-0.920), and this remained significant after FDR correction (p = 0.024). In stratified analysis, a significant decreased risk was found in rs2856718C allele in the male subgroup (adjusted OR: 0.778, 95% CI: 0.627-0.966) and hemodialysis subgroup (adjusted OR: 0.713, 95% CI: 0.552-0.921).

5eb74278554a5c78cbaf1cb6561a3455c325031b,pcadapt: an R package to perform genome scans for selection based on principal component analysis.,"The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved in terms of both statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other computer programs for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Keurcien Luu"", ids = ""46672270""); list(name = ""Eric Bazin"", ids = ""2135982""); list(name = ""Michael G.B.

7c4b6182ab80cbe7e26f3ac53adb2f5907bc8888,Transcriptomic analysis of Momordica charantia polysaccharide on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.,"Polysaccharides obtained from Momordica charantia have been shown to exert a hypoglycemic effect, thereby improving glucose metabolism. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. In recent years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly emerged as a major transcriptome profiling system. Herein, RNA-seq was utilized to obtain whole transcriptomes from the livers of SD rats with type 2 diabetes (DM) and type 2 diabetic rats treated with M. charantia polysaccharides (DMCPIIa). In total, 44,752,508-52,585,920 uniquely mapped reads were obtained, covering 85.54% of the annotated transcripts and representing 12,857 mRNA transcripts. Following analytical analysis, 17 differentially expressed genes (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05, false discovery rate qâ€¯<â€¯0.05) were identified in the DMCPIIa group relative to the DM group. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated that 17 differently expressed genes were enriched in specific biological processes mainly relating to glucose metabolism and fat metabolism (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). Furthermore, a subset of the differential genes was selected for validation via real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Collectively, the integrated analysis of differential gene expression, data obtained herein and the examination of previously reported quantitative trait loci, and genome-wide association studies has suggested that pdk4, pkl, hsd11Î²1, msmo1, rbp4 and fads2 may serve as promising candidates for the modulation of type 2 diabetes.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Weiqi Bai"", ids = ""48692782""); list(name = ""Cong Zhang"", ids = ""48934942""); list(name = ""Hongman Chen"", ids = ""7314464"")",e0d8fc4fa1bf76ccac273917c1de3712f43a0eef,,Gene,675,"

5f8b194b89d623c53a48a079a96e146e14ff1acd,Association of schizophrenia in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and gray matter volumetric deficits in the superior temporal gyrus.,"OBJECTIVE
Individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are known to be at high risk of developing schizophrenia. Previous imaging studies have provided limited data on the relation of schizophrenia expression in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to specific regional brain volumetric changes. The authors hypothesized that the main structural brain finding associated with schizophrenia expression in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, as for schizophrenia in the general population, would be gray matter volumetric deficits, especially in the temporal lobes.


METHOD
MR brain images from 29 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and schizophrenia and 34 comparison subjects with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and no history of psychosis were analyzed using a voxel-based morphometry method that also yielded volumes for related region-of-interest analyses. The authors compared data from the two groups using an analysis of covariance model correcting for total intracranial volume, age, sex, IQ, and history of congenital cardiac defects. The false discovery rate threshold was set at 0.05 to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Voxel-based morphometry analyses identified significant gray matter reductions in the left superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann's area 22) in the schizophrenia group. There were no significant between-group differences in white matter or CSF volumes. Region-of-interest analyses showed significant bilateral gray matter volume reductions in the temporal lobes and superior temporal gyri in the schizophrenia group.


CONCLUSIONS
The structural brain expression of schizophrenia associated with the highly penetrant 22q11.2 deletion involves lower gray matter volumes in temporal lobe regions. These structural MRI findings in a 22q11.2 deletion syndrome form of schizophrenia are consistent with those from studies involving schizophrenia samples from the general population. The results provide further support for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome as a genetic subtype and as a useful neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""E. C.

He has given us a very interesting article with much material for thought and exploration. The twogroup mixture model (2.1) provides a convenient and effective framework for multiple testing. The empirical Bayes approach leads naturally to the local false discovery rate (Lfdr) and gives the Lfdr a useful Bayesian interpretation. This and other recent papers of Efron raised several important issues in multiple testing such as theoretical null versus empirical null and the effects of correlation. Much research is needed to better understand these issues. Virtually all FDR controlling procedures in the literature are based on thresholding the ranked p-values. The difference among these methods is in the choice of the threshold. In multiple testing, typically one first uses a p-value based method such as the Benjaminiâ€“ Hochberg procedure for global FDR control and then uses the Lfdr as a measure of significance for individual nonnull cases. See, for example, Efron (2004, 2005). In what follows I will first discuss the drawbacks of using p-value in large-scale multiple testing and demonstrate the fundamental role played by the Lfdr. I then discuss estimation of the null distribution and the proportion of the nonnulls. I will end with some comments about dealing with the dependency. In the discussion I shall use the notation given in Table 1 to summarize the outcomes of a multiple testing procedure. With the notation given in the table, the false discovery rate (FDR) is then defined as FDR = E(N10/R|R > 0)Pr(R > 0).",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""T.

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined health as a state of physical, mental and social well-being, public health strategies have primarily focused on one domain of well-being. We sought to systematically and simultaneously identify and validate associations of behavioural patterns, psychosocial factors, mental and physical health conditions, access to and utilization of health care and anthropometrics with physical, mental and social well-being.


METHODS
We conducted a longitudinal environment-wide association study (EWAS) with a training and testing set approach, accounting for multiple testing using a false discovery rate control. We used multivariate multilevel regression to examine the association of each exposure at wave 1 with the three outcomes at wave 2 in the Hong Kong FAMILY Cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰10Â 484).


RESULTS
Out of 194 exposures, we identified and validated 14, 5 and 5 exposures that were individually associated with physical, mental and social well-being, respectively. We discovered three factors, namely depressive symptoms, life satisfaction and happiness, that were simultaneously associated with the three domains that define health.


CONCLUSIONS
These associations, if verified to be causal, could become intervention targets to holistically improve population health. Our findings provide empirical support for placing mental health at the forefront of the public health agenda, and also support recent calls to use life satisfaction and happiness to guide public policy.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Y Ni"", ids = ""35190250""); list(name = ""Xiaoxin I Yao"", ids = ""31952661""); list(name = ""Frankin Cheung"", ids = ""2814087""); list(name = ""Joseph T Wu"", ids = ""2221272""); list(name = ""C.

855723d0d07dddeeff81985123ce7e63915b31c3,Discovery of novel genes and gene isoforms by integrating transcriptomic and proteomic profiling from mouse liver.,"Comprehensively identifying gene expression in both transcriptomic and proteomic levels of one tissue is a prerequisite for a deeper understanding of its biological functions. Alternative splicing and RNA editing, two main forms of transcriptional processing, play important roles in transcriptome and proteome diversity and result in multiple isoforms for one gene, which are hard to identify by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics approach due to the relative lack of isoform information in standard protein databases. In our study, we employed MS and RNA-Seq in parallel into mouse liver tissue and captured a considerable catalogue of both transcripts and proteins that, respectively, covered 60 and 34% of protein-coding genes in Ensembl. We then developed a bioinformatics workflow for building a customized protein database that for the first time included new splicing-derived peptides and RNA-editing-caused peptide variants, allowing us to more completely identify protein isoforms. Using this experimentally determined database, we totally identified 150 peptides not present in standard biological databases at false discovery rate of <1%, corresponding to 72 novel splicing isoforms, 43 new genetic regions, and 15 RNA-editing sites. Of these, 11 randomly selected novel events passed experimental verification by PCR and Sanger sequencing. New discoveries of gene products with high confidence in two omics levels demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of our approach and its potential application into improve genome annotation.

15980f83d7152672be48ce1e925c0b5cf5c9157b,The interplay between sample size and replicability of results in fMRI studies,"1 Introduction 
Over the past decades, it has become clear that results from fMRI studies suffer from a limited reproducibility (Button et al., 2013; Carp, 2012). Several explanations and solutions have been investigated. Important problems are a high amount of noise associated with fMRI data and the cost of scanning subjects resulting in a limited power to detect reasonable effect sizes observed in the literature (Poldrack et al., 2017). Large-scale collaborations and databases such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N=900, Van Essen et al., 2013), the UK Biobank (N = 500.000, Sudlow et al., 2015) and the IMAGEN consortium (N = 1500, Schumann et al., 2010) provide opportunities for researchers to study reproducibility of fMRI results. 
Turner, Paul, Miller, & Barbey (2017) use data from the HCP to investigate replicability of fMRI results. They investigate image similarity between fMRI group analyses containing up to 121 subjects. Noticeably, they observe a limited replicability even when the maximum amount of subjects is used. 
In this project and building on our own work in Bossier et al. (2016), we use a similar approach to investigate replicability. Replicability is defined as the ability to reproduce an entire experiment by gathering new data using the same materials and methods (Patil, Peng, & Leek, 2016). We use the IMAGEN database that allows for a maximum number of 700 subjects per group analysis. Our goal is to further study the influence of an increasing sample size on fMRI replicability for voxelwise analyses. 
2 Method 
The IMAGEN project is a neuroimaging and genetic study on reinforcement-related behaviour in adolescents. The database contains fMRI data from 1500 adolescents. In an event-related design, participants are instructed to do a series of cognitive tasks. We use the contrast MATH > LANGUAGE. 
The general sampling procedure to create independent images is straightforward. We start with N = 10 and sample at random N subjects for group X and Y. We combine the subjects of each group in a mixed effects group analysis using FLAME1 from the FSL software library (Smith et al., 2004). We then calculate two measurements of replicability (see below). Next, we increment the sample size of each group with 10 and repeat until we reach the maximum of N = 700 subjects for each group. We run the entire sampling process for 50 iterations. 
We consider two measurements. First, we look at the similarity between non-thresholded statistical parametric maps containing a test statistic in each voxel. We calculate the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient on the vectors corresponding to group analysis X and Y. Second, we look at the similarity of thresholded maps. These maps are obtained after significance testing where we control the voxelwise false discovery rate at level 0.05. We then use the binary maps (active or non-active) to calculate the percent overlap of activation (Maitra, 2010). 
3 Results 
In Figure 1, we plot the average observed Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the non-thresholded test statistic images of an fMRI experiment and a replication. When N = 60, we observe a relatively high correlation (> 0.80). 
In Figure 2, we plot the average percent overlap of activation for thresholded images. Results show limited overlap as the overlap is not higher than 0.4 when N = 60. In fact, only when N = 200 we get 60% overlap between two thresholded images. 
4 Conclusion 
Similarity between a thresholded image and a replication can be limited. The correlation between test-statistic images is high. This is promising for applications focusing on prediction or decoding (Gorgolewski et al., 2015). However, we need large sample sizes to achieve higher spatial overlap of activation between two fMRI replications. Based on a different study, using an independent database, we confirm the main conclusions of Turner et al. (2017). By studying larger sample sizes, we provide further insight into the interplay between sample size and reproducibility.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Han Bossier"", ids = ""7873083""); list(name = ""Ruth Seurinck"", ids = ""1820850""); list(name = ""Sarah Roels"", ids = ""48732499""); list(name = ""Simone KÃ¼hn"", ids = ""1895071""); list(name = ""B.

The library preparation was performed with Illumina TrueSeq RNA kit and analyzed by Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing system.ResultsAn average of 48.5 million reads for B cells, and 50.6 million reads for CLL specimens were obtained with 10396 and 10448 assembled transcripts for normal B cells and primary CLL specimens respectively. With the Cuffdiff analysis, 2091 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between B cells and CLL specimens based on FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million reads and false discovery rate, FDR qâ€‰<â€‰0.05, fold change >2) were identified. Expression of selected DEGs (nâ€‰=â€‰32) with up regulated and down regulated expression in CLL from RNA-seq data were also analyzed by qRT-PCR in a test cohort of CLL specimens. Even though there was a variation in fold expression of DEG genes between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR; more than 90Â % of analyzed genes were validated by qRT-PCR analysis. Analysis of RNA-seq data for splicing alterations in CLL and B cells was performed by Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (MATS analysis). Skipped exon was the most frequent splicing alteration in CLL specimens with 128 significant events (P-value <0.05, minimum inclusion level difference >0.1).ConclusionThe RNA-seq analysis of CLL specimens identifies novel DEG and alternatively spliced genes that are potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets. High level of validation by qRT-PCR for a number of DEG genes supports the accuracy of this analysis.

688caaa88c9d42651be31b15686c48c03fc948ad,A Reality Check for Credit Default Models,"We propose a model selection methodology for credit default modeling in the presence of a large number of variables and candidate models. Accurate credit default models are critical to financial institutions for making effective underwriting and pricing decisions in terms of profit maximization and loss mitigation. Credit default modeling routinely involves large data sets and considers an extremely large set of candidate models. This leads to deriving statistical inference under a multiple hypothesis-testing scheme. An unguarded use of single-inference procedures or the recently popular data snooping techniques such as variable reduction via decision tree analysis and stepwise procedure leave a modeler at risk of making numerous false statistical discoveries, that is pure chance makes the likelihood of a type I error extremely high in data rich environments. To mitigate these concerns we control for the false discovery rate in our model selection procedure and make inference when p-values are dependent. A Monte Carlo study shows that in large data sets with high co-linearity between observations, a naive data snooping approach leads to multiple false discoveries, and a reduction in prediction accuracy. An empirical application of this proposed methodology uses the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Consumer Credit Database, which is a large random sample of individual and tradeline data from one of the three national credit bureaus between 1999 and 2009.",2011,Economics,"list(name = ""Hua Kiefer"", ids = ""145976564""); list(name = ""Leonard Carl Kiefer"", ids = ""118718570"")",dc648f84ba113c5b855b27386e7e614b6649b2f8,,,,
42ad8a0f621318dc0164f9a238239369c2dc02ac,Diverse biological processes coordinate the transcriptional response to nutritional changes in a Drosophila melanogaster multiparent population,"Background Environmental variation in the amount of resources available to populations challenge individuals to optimize the allocation of those resources to key fitness functions. This coordination of resource allocation relative to resource availability is commonly attributed to key nutrient sensing gene pathways in laboratory model organisms, chiefly the insulin/TOR signaling pathway. However, the genetic basis of diet-induced variation in gene expression is less clear. Results To describe the natural genetic variation underlying nutrient-dependent differences, we used an outbred panel derived from a multiparental population, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource. We analyzed RNA sequence data from multiple female tissue samples dissected from flies reared in three nutritional conditions: high sugar (HS), dietary restriction (DR), and control (C) diets. A large proportion of genes in the experiment (19.6% or 2,471 genes) were significantly differentially expressed for the effect of diet, 7.8% (978 genes) for the effect of the interaction between diet and tissue type (LRT, Padj. < 0.05). Interestingly, we observed similar patterns of gene expression relative to the C diet, in the DR and HS treated flies, a response likely reflecting diet component ratios. Hierarchical clustering identified 21 robust gene modules showing intra-modularly similar patterns of expression across diets, all of which were highly significant for diet or diet-tissue interaction effects (false discovery rate, FDR Padj. < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis for different diet-tissue combinations revealed a diverse set of pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms (two-sample t-test, FDR < 0.05). GO analysis on individual co-expressed modules likewise showed a large number of terms encompassing a large number of cellular and nuclear processes (Fisher exact test, Padj. < 0.01). Although a handful of genes in the IIS/TOR pathway including Ilp5, Rheb, and Sirt2 showed significant elevation in expression, known key genes such as InR, chico, insulin peptide genes, and the nutrient-sensing pathways were not observed. Conclusions Our results suggest that a more diverse network of pathways and gene networks mediate the diet response in our population. These results have important implications for future studies focusing on diet responses in natural populations.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Enoch Ng'oma"", ids = ""1410938469""); list(name = ""Patricka A Williams-Simon"", ids = ""1404014558""); list(name = ""Aniqa T.

Accordingly, the factor age may be an important gateway to the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MDS. Insights into the molecular changes of aging hematopoiesis in healthy organisms have found molecular changes, which often parallel the observations in MDS such as increase of clonality with age, change of epigenetic profiles, skewed lineage commitment toward the myeloid compartment and reduced regenerative capacity after stress. The development of MDS is often suggestive of an accelerated extrapolation of molecular changes, which also occur in normal aging hematopoiesis. Beyond this, increasing evidence is suggesting that MDS hematopoiesis is highly dependent on support of the bone marrow (BM) stroma, which has been shown to display aberrant transcriptomic profiles as compared to healthy BM stroma. To this end, we aimed to test the hypothesis whether the emergence of MDS may be associated with a continuity of molecular changes in BM stroma cells during aging. Therefore, we performed explorative RNA sequencing in a set of MSCs collected from healthy young, healthy old and patients with MDS with a highly standardized pre-analytical work-up algorithm. Methods: We collected BM samples from voluntary healthy young adults (age = 24 - 25 years, female n=3, male n=3), healthy old adults (age 66 - 79 years, female n=3, male n=3) and patients with very low - intermediate risk MDS (age 51 - 87 years, female n=3, male n=3). After isolation of BM mononuclear cells by Ficoll gradient centrifugation, 5x106 mononuclear BM cells were seeded into 25cmÂ² flasks and cultured using StemMACS human MSC Expansion Media (Miltenyi Biotec) with weekly media exchange to select for MSCs. These were expanded and harvested in passage 2. Absence of residual hematopoietic cells was controlled by FACS with anti CD45, CD31, and CD146. Whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing on all samples was carried out from 150ng of high quality RNA using the TruSeq stranded total RNA protocol and 100bp paired end sequencing (Illumina). The bio-informatical pipeline consisted of mapping using hisat2 and cufflinks for calculation of differentially expressed genes. Results: RNA-sequencing generated a mean of 94 million reads per sample. Between the groups ""healthy young"" and ""healthy old"" 331 differentially regulated genes were identified. Between ""healthy old"" and ""MDS"" 514 genes were differentially regulated (fold change > 1.5, false discovery rate, FDR 1.7). Although cells were cultured under normoxic conditions, MDS-MSCs displayed marked intrinsic feature of hypoxia. Conclusion: By integrating transcriptomic data from BM stroma cells from healthy individuals during aging and comparison to BM stroma cells from MDS patients we have identified gene sets that are significantly differentially expressed per continuitatem. On the background of the hypothesis that molecular changes in the microenvironment of MDS are an exacerbation of changes also taking place during normal aging in the bone marrow, these genes, which are accumulated in the context of extracellular matrix and cell adhesion are promising candidates to further elucidate a BM stroma based pathogenesis of MDS.

38bc0822810cb72594d0d2d299353698afb6a568,Genome-Wide and Gene-Based Association Studies of Anxiety Disorders in European and African American Samples,"Anxiety disorders (ADs) are common mental disorders caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Since ADs are highly comorbid with each other, partially due to shared genetic basis, studying AD phenotypes in a coordinated manner may be a powerful strategy for identifying potential genetic loci for ADs. To detect these loci, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADs. In addition, as a complementary approach to single-locus analysis, we also conducted gene- and pathway-based analyses. GWAS data were derived from the control sample of the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) project (2,540 European American and 849 African American subjects) genotyped on the Affymetrix GeneChip 6.0 array. We applied two phenotypic approaches: (1) categorical case-control comparisons (CC) based upon psychiatric diagnoses, and (2) quantitative phenotypic factor scores (FS) derived from a multivariate analysis combining information across the clinical phenotypes. Linear and logistic models were used to analyse the association with ADs using FS and CC traits, respectively. At the single locus level, no genome-wide significant association was found. A trans-population gene-based meta-analysis across both ethnic subsamples using FS identified three genes (MFAP3L on 4q32.3, NDUFAB1 and PALB2 on 16p12) with genome-wide significance (false discovery rate (FDR] <5%). At the pathway level, several terms such as transcription regulation, cytokine binding, and developmental process were significantly enriched in ADs (FDR <5%). Our approaches studying ADs as quantitative traits and utilizing the full GWAS data may be useful in identifying susceptibility genes and pathways for ADs.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Takeshi Otowa"", ids = ""5080393""); list(name = ""Brion S.

4001f766f6bb522b35ecf1a6c39edc36eb9fc870,Feature-based vs . intensity-based brain image registration : voxel level and structure level performance evaluation,"The power and validity of voxel based and tensor based morphometry methods depend on the accuracy of the brain image registration algorithms they employ. We propose a mutual information based quantitative evaluation method to compare the performance of two publicly available deformable registration packages: HAMMER and algorithms in the ITK package (FEM-Demons) The advantage of our approach is that registration algorithms are quantitatively compared at both global and local levels, thus enabling our method to pinpoint areas of the brain where one algorithm performs significantly better or worse than the others. The brain image dataset used for evaluation consists of a total of 59 images: 20 MR images of Alzheimerâ€™s (AD) patients, 19 MR images of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 MR images of normal (CTL) subjects. Global and localized mutual information scores are used to evaluate the quality of registration, and paired t-tests are used to determine the statistical significance of registration quality differences between the methods at three levels: global, voxel-wise and anatomical structures. We threshold the resulting p-value maps using a false discovery rate control method in order to correct for multiple comparisons. Our results show that both HAMMER and FEM-Demons algorithms do significantly better than an affine registration algorithm, FLIRT, at all three levels for all three subject groups. Comparison between the HAMMER and FEM-Demons algorithms shows that at the global level there is no significant difference in performance between the two algorithms on controls, and FEM-Demons outperforms HAMMER on Alzheimers patients (p-value 0.0416) and MCI patients (p-value 0.0055). At the local and anatomical levels, FEM-Demons and HAMMER dominate each other on different brain regions. Our results indicate that the choice between the HAMMER and the FEM-Demons algorithms should depend on the region of interest of a study.",2006,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Leonid Teverovskiy"", ids = ""2904636""); list(name = ""Owen T.

However, its stocks have dramatically declined due, inter alia, to excessive logging, insufficient natural regeneration and a slow recovery rate. Thus, there is a need to promote enrichment planting and develop effective technique to support its rehabilitation and improve timber production through implementation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Genomic Selection (GS). To assist such efforts, plant materials were collected from a half-sib progeny population in Sari Bumi Kusuma forest concession, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using 5900 markers in sequences obtained from 356 individuals, we detected high linkage disequilibrium (LD) extending up to >145 kb, suggesting that associations between phenotypic traits and markers in LD can be more easily and feasibly detected with GWAS than with analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the detection power of GWAS seems low, since few single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to any focal traits were detected with a stringent false discovery rate, indicating that the speciesâ€™ phenotypic traits are mostly under polygenic quantitative control. Furthermore, Machine Learning provided higher prediction accuracies than Bayesian methods. We also found that stem diameter, branch diameter ratio and wood density were more predictable than height, clear bole, branch angle and wood stiffness traits. Our study suggests that GS has potential for improving the productivity and quality of S. platyclados, and our genomic heritability estimates may improve the selection of traits to target in future breeding of this species.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Sawitri"", ids = ""88602059""); list(name = ""Naoki Tani"", ids = ""46891255""); list(name = ""Mohammad Naâ\200\231iem"", ids = ""143965171""); list(name = ""Widiyatno"", ids = ""6562550""); list(name = ""Sapto Indrioko"", ids = ""1573854232""); list(name = ""Kentaro Uchiyama"", ids = ""46719706""); list(name = ""Rempei Suwa"", ids = ""3208697""); list(name = ""Kevin Kit Siong Ng"", ids = ""2759775""); list(name = ""Soon Leong Lee"", ids = ""11147583""); list(name = ""Yoshihiko Tsumura"", ids = ""51146463"")",,,Forests,11,239

However, when thousands of genes in a microarray data set are evaluated simultaneously by fold changes and significance tests, the probability of detecting false positives rises sharply. In this first microarray study of brachial plexus injury, we applied and compared the performance of two recently proposed algorithms for tackling this multiple testing problem, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and Westfall and Young step down adjusted p values, as well as t-statistics and Welch statistics, in specifying differential gene expression under different biological states.ResultsUsing SAM based on t statistics, we identified 73 significant genes, which fall into different functional categories, such as cytokines / neurotrophin, myelin function and signal transduction. Interestingly, all but one gene were down-regulated in the patients. Using Welch statistics in conjunction with SAM, we identified an additional set of up-regulated genes, several of which are engaged in transcription and translation regulation. In contrast, the Westfall and Young algorithm identified only one gene using a conventional significance level of 0.05.ConclusionIn coping with multiple testing problems, Family-wise type I error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) are different expressions of Type I error rates. The Westfall and Young algorithm controls FWER. In the context of this microarray study, it is, seemingly, too conservative. In contrast, SAM, by controlling FDR, provides a promising alternative.

8bfdf16a27c37b4a149ae3bbf5acccc3955cc362,Functional 'unlocking': bedside detection of covert awareness after severe brain damage.,"Severe acute brain damage, most often caused by trauma, anoxia or stroke, can result in comaâ€”a transient state characterized by complete absence of wakefulness and of signs of awareness. The recovery of wakefulness without signs of awareness heralds a transition to vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS). Patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) show reproducible purposeful behaviours but remain unable to communicate. MCS can be divided into MCS+ and MCS depending on the presence or absence of inconsistent language functions. Emergence of MCS (EMCS) is diagnosed when patients regain functional communication. Finally, patients with locked-in syndrome can be misdiagnosed with these disorders of consciousness because of complete paralysis of voluntary muscles, except for eye-coded communication (Gosseries et al., 2014). Prevalence rates of VS/ UWS and MCS are difficult to evaluate because of a lack of systematic surveillance. In the USA, prevalence estimates range from 25 000 to 420 000 for VS/ UWS and from 112 000 to 280 000 for MCS (Hirschberg and Giacino, 2011). In this issue of Brain, Curley and coworkers address the difficult problem of detecting covert awareness in noncommunicative patients with severe brain damage (Curley et al., 2018). The detection of covert awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness after coma has important consequences for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy, including pain management, rehabilitation and end-of-life decisions. However, high rates of misdiagnosis (up to 40%) have repeatedly been reported between VS/ UWS and MCS. At least five repeated behavioural assessments with a validated standardized scale, the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R), are required to make an accurate clinical diagnosis (Wannez et al., 2017). Yet even after exhaustive behavioural assessments are performed, signs of covert awareness can be detected in 20% of patients in a behavioural VS/UWS with functional MRI and EEG command-following paradigms (e.g. Monti et al., 2010; Cruse et al., 2011) or with transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with high-density EEG (TMS-EEG) (Casarotto et al., 2016). These findings have recently led to the definition of a new clinical entity, referred to as MCS*, functional locked-in syndrome or cognitive motor dissociation syndrome (CMD), where patients are behaviourally unresponsive but show evidence of covert awareness with neuroimaging. While the pathophysiology of CMD remains unclear, the majority of patients diagnosed so far had sustained a traumatic brain injury. The recognition of a high prevalence of CMD after severe brain damage creates an urgent need to improve routine diagnosis of covert awareness and to find means to re-establish communication with these behaviourally unresponsive but conscious individuals. Despite constituting a significant advance, functional MRI command-following paradigms are challenging to use in routine clinical practice because of their lack of portability. Curley et al. describe a new approach to detect covert awareness in patients with severe brain damage at the bedside, using repetitive testing with EEG command-following paradigms. The New York team led by Nicholas Schiff used a variety of tasks, aiming to assess within-subject reliability of responses while taking into account between-subject variability in brain physiology after brain damage. They also performed a systematic comparison between EEG, behavioural data and functional MRI command-following paradigms. The new study included 28 patients with severe acquired brain damage and 15 controls. Among these 28 patients, 17 met behavioural criteria for MCS (one of whom also had an assessment while behaviourally in VS/UWS), eight for EMCS (two of whom also had an assessment while behaviourally in MCS) and three for VS/UWS. The authors performed assessments using a 37-electrode EEG system in most subjects (two patients were recorded with 23 and 29 electrodes). Mental imagery tasks consisted of imagining playing tennis, spatial navigation, swimming, and/or finger tapping. Data analysis quantified changes in EEG power during 10â€“14 s silent periods following task instructions compared to 10â€“14 s silent periods following instructions to rest. Criteria for a positive response to command required two outcomes: first, results had to show significance in at least one run and a trend towards significance in at least one other run for a difference between task and rest in a given channel for at least two contiguous frequency bins, after a two-group resampling test. Second, results also had to be significant after correction for multiple comparisons across channels using the false discovery rate for a two-group test applied to concatenated data from all runs of a given task. These conservative criteria led to an estimation of false positives of 8% in shuffled data from the â€˜tennisâ€™ paradigm. Evidence of EEG command-following was found in 21/28 patients studied (2/3 VS/UWS, 11/17 MCS and all eight EMCS)â€”and all 15 controls. Evidence of functional MRI response to command was found in 9/23 patients (five EEG command-follower patients could not undergo MRI). This is in contrast with previous studies (Monti et al., 2010; Cruse et al., Scientific Commentaries BRAIN 2018: 141; 1236â€“1246 | 1239",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""MÃ©lanie Boly"", ids = ""2186036""); list(name = ""Steven Laureys"", ids = ""32092273"")",,10ef68cd08be5b375aaeb0b4682b7fbf6a0a328d; 2193f960c4456e84a66df367842871be254c260a; ca3c7e86d17c270df26519189e2b6495cbef94a4; f80817dfead5d8421373dace1a7147b821406319; 339bb1ef52eb38b351d00bc738232f8fd9867982; beddc1fa2499011faf000341f07ca9f8682b6418; 030d82f155f31fc2618fa29c5ae9964ae4d49f69; 45462f2ef393df92f4e3d952961d1513b24088e5; 7d356068789c87b36a501ea218f139b40af73431,Brain : a journal of neurology,141 5,"

Many methods have been developed to account for the specifics of count data: non-normality, a dependence of the variance on the mean, and small sample size. Among them, the small number of samples in typical experiments is still a challenge. Here we present a method for differential analysis of count data, using conditional estimation of local pooled dispersion parameters. A comprehensive evaluation of our proposed method in the aspect of differential gene expression analysis using both simulated and real data sets shows that the proposed method is more powerful than other existing methods while controlling the false discovery rates. By introducing conditional estimation of local pooled dispersion parameters, we successfully overcome the limitation of small power and enable a powerful quantitative analysis focused on differential expression test with the small number of samples.",2016,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jungsoo Gim"", ids = ""1969554""); list(name = ""Sungho Won"", ids = ""2911201""); list(name = ""Taesung Park"", ids = ""144903092"")",6f961a80af0b42ba67e3a7a2da676c91c2c402e3,1cb944f8732e34a3719348d0a9eacceb195a5303; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 2cd8dc8fe9e89af280eef7e5b00cecd73e564da9; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; bc258645d961c601bfb769c500aaa3fcef636888; ee03034567b3d1d0f9e89acb8d8944cfd9d9debe; b180c50ee294d2148e187148c472141d53fbd947; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; 8c955ea6d8b19bee9b5360c956a7a5ed947114fe; f540e3d5268ca64097425e08d6059de458f558dc; b5860253e015c27e8b125cf9b7ba2cb543dc36ed; 62f8a69c7e3809949dd023852e0e0a54c49eaf74; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; f9a710c3a5c31c70d4704c2df83f5912f6de91b3; 3e670bc0860d52f6f0d9495964bc3ce7f74d3dd9; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,14 5,"

5d03378ef14210e54553ff60e20644703aada9c3,Algorithms to detect High Frequency Oscillations in human intracerebral electroencephalogram,"Researchers have recently discovered high frequency oscillations (HFOs) of short duration in the 100-450 Hz band using the intracerebral electroencephalogram of epileptic patients (surgical candidates). New tools are being developed to study this phenomenon. The frequent occurrence of HFOs makes a visual identification tedious and time-consuming. Automated screening is much more efficient, repeatable, and objective. We introduced an original baseline selection method and enhanced two published HFO detection algorithms based on filters and wavelets. We then compared their performance to that of a human reviewer. Ten minutes of electroencephalogram from five patients was acquired by filtering in 0.1-500 Hz band and sampling at 2000 Hz. A human reviewer visually identified HFOs that were considered ground-truths to measure the performance of the two algorithms. The sensitivity and false discovery rate of the filter method were 75.9% and 10.6% respectively, while those for the Wavelet method were 70.8% and 13.1% respectively. Our methods provide satisfactory performance for HFO detection.%%%%Les chercheurs ont decouvert recemment des oscillations haute frequence de courte duree, dans la bande 100-450 Hz, en utilisant des electrodes intracerebrales sur des patients epileptiques (candidats a la chirurgie).

f4e8272a3e3c57ec1fe984d93c837a0b3e2c81d9,Transcript Isoform Variation Associated with Cytosine Modification in Human Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines.,"Cytosine modification on DNA is variable among individuals, which could correlate with gene expression variation. The effect of cytosine modification on interindividual transcript isoform variation (TIV), however, remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the extent of cytosine modification-specific TIV in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from unrelated individuals of European and African descent. Our study detected cytosine modification-specific TIVs for 17% of the analyzed genes at a 5% false discovery rate. Forty-five percent of the TIV-associated cytosine modifications correlated with the overall gene expression levels as well, with the corresponding CpG sites overrepresented in transcript initiation sites, transcription factor binding sites, and distinct histone modification peaks, suggesting that alternative isoform transcription underlies the TIVs. Our analysis also revealed 33% of the TIV-associated cytosine modifications that affected specific exons, with the corresponding CpG sites overrepresented in exon/intron junctions, splicing branching points, and transcript termination sites, implying that the TIVs are attributable to alternative splicing or transcription termination. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of TIV shared target preference but exerted independent effects on 61% of the common exon targets. Cytosine modification-specific TIVs detected from LCLs were differentially enriched in those detected from various tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas, indicating their developmental dependency. Genes containing cytosine modification-specific TIVs were enriched in pathways of cancers and metabolic disorders. Our study demonstrated a prominent effect of cytosine modification variation on the transcript isoform spectrum over gross transcript abundance and revealed epigenetic contributions to diseases that were mediated through cytosine modification-specific TIV.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xu Sunny Zhang"", ids = ""46447215""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""143652301"")",a114fc80372c1fbc8ef3a7b03dad227b491b99df,,Genetics,203 2,"

50e71b30b96e334d614bc2912ba71a475b81ef5f,Metabolome-Wide Mendelian Randomization Analysis of Emotional and Behavioral Responses to Traumatic Stress,"Trauma exposure is an important risk factor for several psychiatric disorders; however, the mechanisms that underlie emotional and behavioral responses to traumatic stress are unclear. To understand these mechanisms, this study investigated the genetic overlap and causal relationship between blood metabolites and traits related to trauma response using genome-wide data. Five traits related to trauma response â€œin the past monthâ€ ascertained in the UK Biobank (52 816<N<117 900 individuals) were considered: i) â€œAvoided activities or situations because of previous stressful experienceâ€ (Avoidance); ii) â€œFelt distant from other peopleâ€ (Distant); iii) â€œFelt irritable or had angry outburstsâ€ (Irritable); iv) â€œFelt very upset when reminded of stressful experienceâ€ (Upset); v) â€œRepeated disturbing thoughts of stressful experienceâ€ (Repeated Thoughts). These were investigated with respect to 52 metabolites assessed using nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics in a previous genome-wide association study (up to 24,925 individuals of European descent). Applying linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), polygenic risk scoring (PRS), and Mendelian randomization (MR), we observed that 14 metabolites were significantly correlated with trauma response traits (p<0.05); PRS of 4 metabolites (citrate (CIT); glycoprotein acetyls (GP); concentration of large very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles (LVLDLP); total cholesterol in medium particles of VLDL (MVLDLC)) were associated with traits related to trauma response (false discovery rate Q<10%). These associations were partially due to causal relationships (CITâ†’Upset Î²=-0.058, p=9.1Ã—10âˆ’4; GPâ†’Avoidance Î²=0.008, p=0.003; LVLDLPâ†’Distant Î²=0.008, p=0.022; MVLDLCâ†’Avoidance Î²=0.019, p=3Ã—10âˆ’4).

a759777f7c4d59bd43f870d98f618ac09ad66fa3,Optimal False Discovery Rate Control for Dependent Data.,"This paper considers the problem of optimal false discovery rate control when the test statistics are dependent. An optimal joint oracle procedure, which minimizes the false non-discovery rate subject to a constraint on the false discovery rate is developed. A data-driven marginal plug-in procedure is then proposed to approximate the optimal joint procedure for multivariate normal data. It is shown that the marginal procedure is asymptotically optimal for multivariate normal data with a short-range dependent covariance structure. Numerical results show that the marginal procedure controls false discovery rate and leads to a smaller false non-discovery rate than several commonly used p-value based false discovery rate controlling methods. The procedure is illustrated by an application to a genome-wide association study of neuroblastoma and it identifies a few more genetic variants that are potentially associated with neuroblastoma than several p-value-based false discovery rate controlling procedures.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jichun Xie"", ids = ""4999927""); list(name = ""Tengfei Cai"", ids = ""49282956""); list(name = ""John M.

10fa181c38c8d9483ffcb8a9fd1fd511c04a8482,The identification of functional motifs in temporal gene expression analysis,"The identification of transcription factor binding sites is essential to the understanding of the regulation of gene expression and the reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks. The in silico identification of cis-regulatory motifs is challenging due to sequence variability and lack of sufficient data to generate consensus motifs that are of quantitative or even qualitative predictive value. To determine functional motifs in gene expression, we propose a strategy to adopt false discovery rate (FDR) and estimate motif effects to evaluate combinatorial analysis of motif candidates and temporal gene expression data. The method decreases the number of predicted motifs, which can then be confirmed by genetic analysis. To assess the method we used simulated motif/expression data to evaluate parameters. We applied this approach to experimental data for a group of iron responsive genes in Salmonella typhimurium 14028S. The method identified known and potentially new ferric-uptake regulator (Fur) binding sites. In addition, we identified uncharacterized functional motif candidates that correlated with specific patterns of expression. A SAS code for the simulation and analysis gene expression data is available from the first author upon request.",2005,,"list(name = ""Jiuzhou Song"", ids = ""1733897""); list(name = ""Jaime Bjarnason"", ids = ""48562610""); list(name = ""Michael G.

4645c206f855941c2af395c0cadc4052a5bafafe,"Large expression differences in genes for iron and zinc homeostasis, stress response, and lignin biosynthesis distinguish roots of Arabidopsis thaliana and the related metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens.","The micronutrient zinc has an essential role in physiological and metabolic processes in plants as a cofactor or structural element in 300 catalytic and noncatalytic proteins, but it is very toxic when available in elevated amounts. Plants tightly regulate their internal zinc concentrations in a process called zinc homeostasis. The exceptional zinc hyperaccumulator species Thlaspi caerulescens can accumulate up to 3% of zinc, but also high amounts of nickel and cadmium, without any sign of toxicity. This should have drastic effects on the zinc homeostasis mechanism. We examined in detail the transcription profiles of roots of Arabidopsis thaliana and T. caerulescens plants grown under deficient, sufficient, and excess supply of zinc. A total of 608 zinc-responsive genes with at least a 3-fold difference in expression level were detected in A. thaliana and 352 in T. caerulescens in response to changes in zinc supply. Only 14% of these genes were also zinc responsive in A. thaliana. When comparing A. thaliana with T. caerulescens at each zinc exposure, more than 2,200 genes were significantly differentially expressed (>or=5-fold and false discovery rate < 0.05). While a large fraction of these genes are of yet unknown function, many genes with a different expression between A. thaliana and T. caerulescens appear to function in metal homeostasis, in abiotic stress response, and in lignin biosynthesis. The high expression of lignin biosynthesis genes corresponds to the deposition of lignin in the endodermis, of which there are two layers in T. caerulescens roots and only one in A. thaliana.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Judith E. van de Mortel"", ids = ""117015982""); list(name = ""Laia Almar Villanueva"", ids = ""117799702""); list(name = ""Henk Schat"", ids = ""5855413""); list(name = ""Jeroen Kwekkeboom"", ids = ""7443146""); list(name = ""Sean J.

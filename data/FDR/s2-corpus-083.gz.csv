e0151a26f649f5119f1d7316bf9be3aa8050eab5,[op.4d.04] Metabolomic Study of the Effect of Uromodulin on Biochemical Pathways in the Kidneys.,"OBJECTIVE
UMOD-/- mice have low blood pressure and decreased salt-sensitivity indicating interactions between UMOD and sodium transport. However, it's unclear whether the effect of UMOD is solely through interaction with cognate molecules in the TAL or whether the perturbations in physiology are more complex with involvement of the TAL and other parts of the nephron. We propose to answer this by metabolomic profiling of renal tissue from UMOD+/+ and UMOD-/- mice.


DESIGN AND METHOD
UMOD+/+ and UMOD-/- male mice of 12 weeks of age were treatedâ€ŠÂ±â€Š2% NaCl ad libitum in the drinking water for 6 weeks (nâ€Š=â€Š5 per group). Following the stimulation period mice were sacrificed, and both kidneys excised for metabolic analysis; one kidney was dissected and outer medulla tubules removed, the other kidney remained whole. Global biochemical profiles were determined in both tissue matrices (Metabolon Inc). ANOVA contrasts were used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly (p0.05) between experimental groups. An estimate of the false discovery rate (q-value) is calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Lipid and lipid metabolites were prominently altered in UMOD-/- mice. The protein glycosylation substrates UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine were elevated in UMOD-/- whole kidney under normal-salt and salt-load conditions. Bile acids were significantly lower in UMOD-/- in both whole kidney and outer medulla samples. The most significant salt-load dependent change in UMOD-/- mice was an increase in 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid + 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid in UMOD-/- in outer medulla. The endocannabinoids palmitoyl ethanolamide and oleoyl ethanolamide were elevated in UMOD-/- medulla, while arachidonoyl ethanolamide was lower in UMOD-/- outer medulla.


CONCLUSIONS
This study is the first to investigate metabolic profiles in UMOD-/- mice (Â±2% NaCl). We found UMOD-/- disrupts lipid signalling in kidney and outer medulla, suggesting a mechanism that influences kidney metabolite excretion and/or reabsorption. Higher levels of protein glycosylation precursors signify changes in secreted protein synthesis rates. Additionally, 13-HODE and 9-HODE alteration in UMOD-/- mice impact glomerular filtration rate. Understanding the effects of the altered UMOD expression on urinary excretion and plasma metabolite levels may offer insights into the various effects of the protein on sodium homeostasis.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""L Graham"", ids = ""153885248""); list(name = ""Delyth Graham"", ids = ""144576884""); list(name = ""Martin W.

16574db60ef9ba5c7ea740d6f379e82f27ac372a,Efficiently identifying genome-wide changes with next-generation sequencing data,"We propose a new and effective statistical framework for identifying genome-wide differential changes in epigenetic marks with ChIP-seq data or gene expression with mRNA-seq data, and we develop a new software tool EpiCenter that can efficiently perform data analysis. The key features of our framework are: (i) providing multiple normalization methods to achieve appropriate normalization under different scenarios, (ii) using a sequence of three statistical tests to eliminate background regions and to account for different sources of variation and (iii) allowing adjustment for multiple testing to control false discovery rate (FDR) or family-wise type I error. Our software EpiCenter can perform multiple analytic tasks including: (i) identifying genome-wide epigenetic changes or differentially expressed genes, (ii) finding transcription factor binding sites and (iii) converting multiple-sample sequencing data into a single read-count data matrix. By simulation, we show that our framework achieves a low FDR consistently over a broad range of read coverage and biological variation. Through two real examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the usages of our tool. In particular, we show that our novel and robust 'parsimony' normalization method is superior to the widely-used 'tagRatio' method.

b17b18e831a042e1c79727e1cc95f8e1b4903a1d,Screening of potential gene markers for predicting carotid atheroma plaque formation using bioinformatics approaches,"The present study aimed to investigate potential gene markers for predicting the formation of carotid atheroma plaques using highâ€‘throughput bioinformatics methods. The GSE43292 gene expression profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following data processing, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using a paired tâ€‘test in the Linear Models for Microarray Data package with the criteria of a false discovery rate of P<0.05 and |log2 foldâ€‘change| â‰¥0.58, followed by functional enrichment, proteinâ€‘protein interaction (PPI) network construction, key node and module analysis, and prediction of transcription factors (TFs) targeting genes in the significant modules. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles from 32Â paired samples of carotid atheroma plaque tissue and macroscopically intact tissue were obtained, based on which 886Â DEGs, including 513Â upregulated genes and 373 downregulated genes, were identified. The upregulated and downregulated gene sets were enriched in 24 and 13 pathways, respectively. The PPI network constructed with these DEGs comprised 35Â key nodes with degreesÂ â‰¥20, among which spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), LYN and phosphatidylinositolâ€‘4,5â€‘bisphosphate 3â€‘kinase catalytic subunitÂ Î³ (PIK3CG) were the three highest. A significant module was mined in the PPI network, which consisted of 29Â DEGs targeted by 11Â TFs. The DEGs between the carotid atheroma plaque and macroscopically intact tissue samples may be involved in carotid atherogenesis. Key nodes in the PPI network constructed from these DEGs and the genes involved in the significant module, including SYK, LYN and PIK3CG, are promising for the prediction of carotid plaque formation.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Guiming Wang"", ids = ""50248729""); list(name = ""Dong Kuai"", ids = ""6499800""); list(name = ""Yudong Yang"", ids = ""2681604""); list(name = ""Gaochao Yang"", ids = ""3853337""); list(name = ""Zhigang Wei"", ids = ""40528928""); list(name = ""Wenbo Zhao"", ids = ""1746204"")",aebda75092bb82e0c697abd0d7fe7a82376a20b0; 2ec864d74d8c941f1c48b21e25ec72a345e200bc; 96aaca613d96719382d9f512d24082f7f94a664d,3c242b7997ca333f957477d019cd7b173848974a; 09f372650b2c41310f128427c2e9456de3d143ea; 3b7f4962786c088b23920e33e9cb464cdb20ab70; 7c33a580f3b31fa8368808f85e440bad836c5ccf; 146550c98bde826914f6c2cc77516e200cd1b623; 13ceda93a3f46544d59fad1c22c6e07c03bf515a; 6bf5bc8378101a29caec38244c6fa4e4842a9ef8; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; 4b137bcfefa79aca6d69efefcbd0416e271c603b; adf0a1fa22518dff2b3a87b90742f5912c5839f1; 62be62bf0f158345f75e6c566442a831dd92951c; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; e92a4f6b9f64f732387154dc4d42725c9ba36092; 03e7f5081f73e5dd43bb02939e10b648fa8a91a8; 73afc2a2a7a4fed740801470233dc33698ea6bb3; dc539f3ca7d1cde7ee9e84fcd25a495f7439e34a; 145dccbd5dadbffca8c7cfaaa63d19c6a04f01cf; 5455b339e2bd0fb79de1af160510dd97adb3796e; 8a36a936be6300d4223bb77cae75844a65928959; 688313660a3a1ad7438774b6c03a0dfd04cdd627; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 0e6aefc52cc98104fdd802cd4fa9878d9f5fbca5; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 98d23de9179453b5bdae2558f2120c10fe2824f7; 8147bb070d38fa1504a52d6bea8153da6ee2e6f6; 5fa0c9c3c51b32150fb32a0110a7642f7d0f0881; 29a0cfc4183c93722072e3e42a62082abc60421e; 096108c23be515096310b31e32371b31f94df44b; a9bdfd522713627a145dc3fca361039cb3c162d2; de1d245ae475862adad4e6c8abd196ca18c9f34e; cf8d5a66bd7db1e5fd8d5e3e57dc542af46ef2aa; 70e0e13f11abb01c4a71a1b95cb2f473eb04e7e5; 44f3e3e9aad4148fc94d00b24b256cb06d3767e2,Molecular Medicine Reports,15,2039 - 2048
31c190240107efcc5c7867d39fe5c2fe6b230c3a,Estimation procedures for the false discovery rate: a systematic comparison for microarray data,"The microarray technology developed in recent years allows for measuring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. In most microarray experiments the measurements are taken under two experimental conditions. Statistical procedures to identify differentially expressed genes involve a serious multiple comparison problem as we have to carry out as many hypothesis testings as the number of candidate genes in the experiment. If we apply the usual type I error rate Î± in each testing, then the probability to reject any truly null hypothesis will greatly exceed the intended overall Î± level. We focus on the recent error control concept of the false discovery rate FDR for which an increasing number of competing estimates as well as algorithms is available. However, there is little comparative evidence. For parametric as well as nonparametric test statistics relevant FDR procedures and typical parameter settings are discussed, including the use of â€˜correctingâ€™ constants in the estimation of the pooled variance. An in-depth simulation study is performed aiming at the aforementioned points with respect to sound statistical inference for microarray gene expression data. Finally the famous Hedenfalk data set is analyzed in a similar fashion and conclusions are drawn for practical microarray analysis.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Michael G.

b038e589957537a7a60cc0e3a38aec23de1a6ef5,Accounting for proximal variants improves neoantigen prediction,"Recent efforts to design personalized cancer immunotherapies use predicted neoantigens, but most neoantigen prediction strategies do not consider proximal (nearby) variants that alter the peptide sequence and may influence neoantigen binding. We evaluated somatic variants from 430 tumors to understand how proximal somatic and germline alterations change the neoantigenic peptide sequence and also affect neoantigen binding predictions. On average, 241 missense somatic variants were analyzed per sample. Of these somatic variants, 5% had one or more in-phase missense proximal variants. Without incorporating proximal variant correction for major histocompatibility complex class I neoantigen peptides, the overall false discovery rate (incorrect neoantigens predicted) and the false negative rate (strong-binding neoantigens missed) across peptides of lengths 8â€“11 were estimated as 0.069 (6.9%) and 0.026 (2.6%), respectively.Including patient-specific information about nearby somatic and germline alterations improves the accuracy of neoantigen prediction, potentially impacting cancer vaccine design.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jasreet Hundal"", ids = ""3081783""); list(name = ""Susanna Kiwala"", ids = ""16053758""); list(name = ""Yang-Yang Feng"", ids = ""23572284""); list(name = ""Connor J.

Here, we describe an improved methodology combining immuno-affinity enrichment of MHC class II complexes, optimized elution conditions and quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based characterization of the immunopeptidome. The methodology allowed the identification of over 1000 peptides with 1% false discovery rate from 10(8) murine A20 lymphoma cells. The study revealed the I-A(d) -specific motif in high resolution after multisequence alignment. The methodology was generally applied to the purification of MHC class II from cell lines and murine spleens. We identified 2963 peptides from BALB/c and 2712 from C57BL/6 mouse spleens. The identification of peptides bound to MHC class II in vitro and in vivo will facilitate the characterization of T-cell specificities, as well as the development of biotherapeutics and vaccines.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adriana Åžofron"", ids = ""13000586""); list(name = ""Danilo Ritz"", ids = ""32464393""); list(name = ""Dario Neri"", ids = ""144526984""); list(name = ""Tim Fugmann"", ids = ""2191451"")",413d6122b22e9af0b02b7f12107c2135e833c34f; dde64b8beacaa9e0740390448bf27a25344c1557; a55a362176bce90411479873c48d7d071fc52fd1; cb92addb2c3363ac6092d119627f8a811afb4d45; 1e07e97fe40daca5a4a0c339074b7763ff763108; 939ffec3583f6dbf0c3fce3886fd1996e87aff55; 196155d0b93d3b7b5ee11e2664d86614ae1aee4b; 193af90578e1932f97a822319b920e3639ae0ee7; 635cb454464220e2c01ed60a047f061aa8207eea; 2de125791bbebc1fae72afdedeaf12463c26740c; dfe6cf471c8cec7fe24eefa4641fd44ffd7de77f; 87a03f6f53685904d85a09a28001e8bd0ddff80b; 6cbbc0fbbd13625023594527f5d283d4c7b50b2e; 367719451e4082b2a95350b1b8084c677f36eedf; b9173a14cf757cc10ab54716585dbe1a6ac69976; 4415d653c94bb130b2990202cc3cfc09f670d4a1; b32435613bc42a75dff2febbb2fa5be1f119e219; a94352cef40fbe745efdcd73b8f0bbd1a07da24e,bd9237440668a011f7826373a1ae41dd0b049aea; d8a01c45893cd1ee250a0c6efdd7ab518fb8f309; cf2628cce91dd8eca44d3bdc48a8e5e1a69ef22f; d347f7018468d3834fcc09e50389d0ac8ae15674; 0afe9a4c42193c735a833ec992bfc6df4efec09f; 9855c0bed4cf0919fe2bbab950de7c4d60f230b3; 5ae0da66b8ada7449f2ebec1312e362506e7020e; 2f9ca87eb4fb7467c755ae23d44921c7dfd9f0da; 4a4bba9b829266bfc1dc69cdf0a51e053d3ec033; eeccd666dc7129b6c7b49c8085509edfef23eed9; 7b8db5376227387b4eecd62fadba0517dd585675; 4122b0c3819ca43e4e22da7c75e418a74befd968; 08d89d7ad90992f5dfccba87a5b841a4822ef8e2; b859d9dc17c2c87771b11fe7ef557fd1da3a116b; f68c88ba04c4a97e9184011a8a5b1814a6939749; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 24a350d5e33765be734ad10f7116ec93a1d245d7; eda4b41ba3f7aa1a2af7eeeebc4c2397c0a8df70; 342390a51e7ecfc57ff77f39469a771f8c6b7680; d3bfeba35f999d2da811ab9a59e9afca797ffd7c; fa78d9e45cf1ab060d8bb11f04e94ad71831ea92; 51a3055d0d2de24db9eb743a0aafad292f8f4cf7; b141427446af441daa453903e1f9ef9dd2db96cd; be5815089b4f05d38cdc84dc71dcd87000717268; 23edbfd4b54b6b6a169ac942cf31cdb20880358f; 2b9f8d799830e1a9f03456201ffb8462550aff53; 930c050edf0ddc1f1e68738818e702997337ec9e; 895d25664e74edd0366b81d6b9f130d05defbfcb; 7175ff0ddf4aa9d67bf0eb42bf18533e65747a56; e21093957535df4fa0748852077d9f535d28dc6b; 7cbd6f41ccfbf9e8c68196daeb40ab10e8f54385; a8561503a3b9fa940b6792cdee2abe45a825159f; e44585b78b02e6c36d85f98dbc1230a249f58052; 9c248fbf99e778bc8b2ff2f45576cb162b4b4b51; 842167f1097e65d5fa41de17a8b0d3bd679295b8; 9066c2f078c0d6ec5ca8387a79aa706d37b2ae78; f81cbe21646d1cf9ef277ce90a2615692b02a256; 8b1cafdb2c1e48bff8c4427a9de4d77ed28cc6a0; 93f722e0e9929bb1df1e39c92c56d076ffcf4a63,European journal of immunology,46 2,"

This study aimed at identifying the transcriptome distinctions of PBMCs between these patient groups.MethodsGenome-wide transcriptomes of PBMCs from 10 HIV/HCV co-infected patients, 7 HIV+ patients, 5 HCV+ patients, and 5 HIV/HCV sero-negative healthy controls were analyzed using Illumina microarray. Pairwise comparisons were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to detect the global dysregulations of the biological pathways between HIV, HCV mono- and co-infection.ResultsForty-one, 262, and 44 DEGs with fold changeâ€‰>â€‰1.5 and FDR (false discovery rate) <0.05 for the comparisons of HCV versus co-infection, HIV versus co-infection, and HIV versus HCV were identified, respectively. Significantly altered pathways (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05), featured by those involved in immune system, signaling transduction, and cell cycle, were detected. Notably, the differential regulation of cytotoxicity pathway discriminated between HIV, HCV mono- and co-infection (up-regulated in the former versus the latter group: co-infection versus HIV or HCV, HIV versus HCV; FDR <0.001â€‰~â€‰0.019). Conversely, the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was down-regulated in co-infection versus either HCV (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.003) or HIV (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.028). For the comparison of HIV versus HCV, the cell cycle (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.016) and WNT signaling (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.006) pathways were up- and down-regulated in HIV, respectively.ConclusionsOur study is the first to identify the differential regulation of cytotoxicity pathway discriminating between HIV, HCV mono- and co-infection, which may reflect the distinct patterns of virus-host cell interactions underlying disease progression. Further inspection of cytotoxicity pathway has pinned down to the expression of the KIR genes to be associated with specific patterns of particular virus-host interactions. Between HIV and HCV, the altered cell cycle and WNT signaling pathways may suggest the different impact of HIV and HCV on cell proliferation and differentiation.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Qin Wu"", ids = ""144783160""); list(name = ""Monica Miranda Saksena"", ids = ""34210354""); list(name = ""Vincent Soriano"", ids = ""145481099""); list(name = ""Eugenia Vispo"", ids = ""5898581""); list(name = ""Nitin K Saksena"", ids = ""4098090"")",b670d6adb92fde935777036b6baa42f7de1a7c0e; 8f63f9071a75208d66491f04bb0fa3acb95996a8; 396bad9744b77dd8f75026ae8d5d49e53f9caf8e; 99b583d17113769a953b2ee6c86610707c080eb8,8e9c06366e517a1c85bed2244ee3da9b012016e4; 620ac81071f140e9e935e097eb4185a10a84cb7a; f93b1bab7b3bbb8e7dd61d550f7a3101103ce121; 62f490814d07adaedd69aa18a1ad3b756cc71bcd; 782ed38e3b9d2aa3c9d7e409202e47706810285e; 61f9871f7b261b1815dd492cbbed30566345f173; c258d0814ac16455fa48f752c22b3bd4bdce03c1; fa67051ba62471a6c228b3c10cf3d223b5ece4e0; 27d5924e83c9be2d4e76a89e2879e726c695aec3; dd889125ad0273eb2e101d7f7a8e7f586cb6eab5; a747c467f39a1e9b88fa72d1297e6b28470d0925; 2ea05f550fb34e5fcda7be55ed291f1748ae5147; bad92a0f73386b2829827a7be8de051dbb3c6e02; f83689cbee170cea69379c65e9f096899f72c289; 332ac9402a727c85e81a6e2b368436f9425def39; 25a0d81517d67d31e3edd28db845a567922a5dc2; 2c251ec968a8e025c34137e71031860efdbb34a5; 6c886546877724ab4779eeed44ecebd7588d39a6; e09e68ecedc24faeb8e8b4e04a3b9be21bc59db0; a7fa61d6313cbcfc8efb484d14fc13fdef19ff32; ffa896f36fdd0f93d3f895039868589944cc1618; b29dc3481581f724c331e754008cf081a77606d9; f0e420b57065da2d189288925ec044323bafa26a; f4007da61594beb72635043d97ac1bfd677979ae; 1c51395e5b67eaa625c397b948f7391f78ddc7b0; 059b22c5ac8662d93568cf10394a3212a0a22b7e; ab5e22cd91b55975ee63b828aba96ffd4143f27d; 4187d1a20ec089381ed08ed6fedd2088b600cf72; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; d3a5b306612bfcaa5385b3a84e1d6c3a21025ed8; c2dbdb8684c7d0c93be6ac34d4751912c37dca5f; ea0c160dcbb9cf388f68622acf9d9ec431b8ddf0; b616a6f40f1e14e0abd6e1ccdf5e3fb39f43c9ce; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; ea78daba0ef5289844727c8e29bf6c23cb010309; 485b65e374140896a4cc8e758c359a7be634bf98; f38effc51cee765ce4faef9a1113b0c9024bd770; 9f799afc6bfb9a380aaf9cbbbd63f02c0baa997b; ad0bf6f2523b9716dae32069912a41a2e1ddd2fc; 39c6d4ab85c1697a32e636c06af09eb808529bcb; 3dad5905ce5cb443eda38d310538023fac6181eb; bc3c2419a00b3aaa59900e137b183e46f9f51d69; 795bcb78ad12f981a3eef46f05c569a29535b0e0; e211b2c37e3756f47dcc526ca1b9f7fa3c3ef259; b3d3b89fa6770c8a83dd652d27531c5a4dea4882; 4ae02e1d580363edf11e72572879e2e7df663749; e1e19f79e0ce21ac8137b646e50c40f463b207ee; b2902b4ba6b8ac47636b2f8e74b028c86fd634e8; dd44c6bc5e028685232aeee57db9de32537806b5; 25b874da84328fce9a48a86330391623b4bf8838; 052584e09865810d6509313808f2c0270634f0a0; df19699a300febcb2862e8e96e8d72d0236d6b86; dee83ccbdfe543c80a088848591ac8e94c3284bd; 54810420accc9141460e47aa8d2d1ae04189365f; 940d4c71038bc86ad6df33208747a0a81686a85b; c1470d1b6302f7a5bb0911ac40179d940e10b232; 679f7df743193a0a3c010900efe9a0cb0fb5864e; 5489a34fe93a7bf16b23ac3b5565a4cd58db0969; 5624970633ac24b77abb9901d76fc1d2b378df74; 909f4d5caafa4ce4bcbffd583a71e26f641d2392; 21bc391071d69b66c1ffba423fcd9fe106d41ee4; fad64667ffa39d0b6f57bb1209920c253c8115f2; ab96ce20f3be1b951486c9db8c6875cc6b7b87ad; 907b10191c9048efbfa92a5101e6de37b438d886; b50e6022f24765774e05d8e5b9afa519e75a8999,Virology Journal,12,

They present their findings in the context of hospital versus â€œphysician-based measures for Merit-Based incentive Payment.â€1 There are multiple reasons to evaluate the performance of hospitals and their anesthesia departments as single teams.2 glance et al.1 summarize the policy options well. in this editorial, we consider the implications of the article for evaluating individual anesthesiologists. individuals are hired, are credentialed by hospitals, and are promoted. Consequently, reasonably, there are multiple requirements from accreditation agencies (e.g., The Joint Commission, oak Brook, illinois) and corporations (e.g., universities) to evaluate individual anesthesiologistsâ€™ clinical performance. When comparing low-incidence binary data (e.g., patient mortality) among anesthesiologists, one must (1) know patient conditions (risk factors) upon admission, (2) adjust for those risks statistically, and (3) compare among anesthesiologists using hierarchical modeling.1,3,4 Unless risk-adjusted hierarchical modeling is used, the chance of falsely detecting anesthesiologists as having belowaverage performance can be greater than 50% (i.e., worse than flipping a coin).1 The results of the study by glance et al.1 are convincing because their findings are (reasonably) biased toward underestimating false discovery rates (i.e., incorrectly reporting average anesthesiologists as low performers). First, their simulations assume that the risk adjustment model and the data collected are both perfect, which, of course, is untrue with real (clinical) data. second, all providers are assumed to have performed the same numbers of cases, which, again, will be untrue. With imbalance in case numbers, the 95% Cis calculated by the authors would be less accurate (e.g., greater false discovery rates).5 Collecting patient risk factor data and performing hierarchical logistic regression modeling take substantial resources (e.g., analysts).6 The expertise for this versus studentâ€™s t test is analogous to comparing anesthesia expertise for cardiac surgery versus diagnostic colonoscopy. yet, if your department reports lowincidence adverse events (e.g., less than or equal to the 2.7% incidence simulated by glance et al.1) by an anesthesiologist, the results show that your department should use risk-adjusted hierarchical logistic regression modeling.1,7 in our opinion, hiring analysts for this purpose is not worthwhile. suppose your department accepts a false discovery rate (see glance et al.1) of approximately 5%. Then, even with unrealistically large n = 1,000 patients per anesthesiologist per evaluation period for an endpoint, glance et al.1 show that there is only a 14.2% sensitivity to detect anesthesiologists with 50% greater than average rates of adverse outcomes. Thus, even for the highest risk procedures (e.g., cardiac surgery), typically a small proportion of the total anesthesia caseload, poorly performing anesthesiologists cannot reliably be identified.1,4,8 The reason is that serious adverse events are simply too infrequent for accurate comparisons of individual anesthesiologists. As glance et al.1 recommend, public reporting and merit-based payment should be by hospital. Comparing individual anesthesiologists based on clinical performance measures that occur more frequently also has been fruitless.9â€“12 For example, pain upon arrival in the postanesthesia care unit needs to be risk adjusted for factors often not known accurately (e.g., the specific postanesthesia care unit nurse obtaining the pain score and patient chronic opioid use).9 When the risk adjustments are made, differences Do Not Use Hierarchical Logistic Regression Models with Low-incidence Outcome Data to Compare Anesthesiologists in Your Department",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Franklin Dexter"", ids = ""144441416""); list(name = ""Bradley J.

154342981288c53a97b9c83edbc0dfd2366de037,Mutated SF3B1 is associated with transcript isoform changes of the genes UQCC and RPL31 both in CLLs and uveal melanomas,"Background Genome sequencing studies of chronic lympoid leukemia (CLL) have provided a comprehensive overview of recurrent somatic mutations in coding genes. One of the most intriguing discoveries has been the prevalence of mutations in the HEAT-repeat domain of the splicing factor SF3B1. A frequently observed variant is predicted to cause the substitution of a lysine with a glutamic acid at position 700 of the protein (K700E). However, the molecular consequences of the mutations are largely unknown. Results To start exploring this question, we sequenced the transcriptomes of six samples: four samples of CLL tumour cells, of which two contained the K700E mutation in SF3B1, and CD19 positive cells from two healthy donors. We identified 41 genes that showed differential usage of exons statistically associated with the mutated status of SF3B1 (false discovery rate of 10%). These genes were enriched in pathways related to interferon signaling and mRNA splicing. Among these genes, we found UQCC and RPL31; notably, a similar effect on these genes was described in a previously published study of uveal melanoma. In addition, while this manuscript was under revision, another study independently reported the common splicing signature of the gene UQCC in different tumour types with mutations in SF3B1. Conclusions Our results suggest common effects of isoform deregulation in the genes UQCC and RPL31 upon mutations in SF3B1.

de6c896d439ec5f2ef86386fb071a051183fc534,Proteomic analysis of Chinese hamster ovary cells.,"To complement the recent genomic sequencing of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, proteomic analysis was performed on CHO cells including the cellular proteome, secretome, and glycoproteome using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of multiple fractions obtained from gel electrophoresis, multidimensional liquid chromatography, and solid phase extraction of glycopeptides (SPEG). From the 120 different mass spectrometry analyses generating 682,097 MS/MS spectra, 93,548 unique peptide sequences were identified with at most 0.02 false discovery rate (FDR). A total of 6164 grouped proteins were identified from both glycoproteome and proteome analysis, representing an 8-fold increase in the number of proteins currently identified in the CHO proteome. Furthermore, this is the first proteomic study done using the CHO genome exclusively, which provides for more accurate identification of proteins. From this analysis, the CHO codon frequency was determined and found to be distinct from humans, which will facilitate expression of human proteins in CHO cells. Analysis of the combined proteomic and mRNA data sets indicated the enrichment of a number of pathways including protein processing and apoptosis but depletion of proteins involved in steroid hormone and glycosphingolipid metabolism. Five-hundred four of the detected proteins included N-acetylation modifications, and 1292 different proteins were observed to be N-glycosylated. This first large-scale proteomic analysis will enhance the knowledge base about CHO capabilities for recombinant expression and provide information useful in cell engineering efforts aimed at modifying CHO cellular functions.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Deniz Baycin-Hizal"", ids = ""1395856862""); list(name = ""David L.

3e1045b3927a4a609108cadf5fc7f38856044bb5,Testing independence with high-dimensional correlated samples,"Testing independence among a number of (ultra) high-dimensional random samples is a fundamental and challenging problem. By arranging $n$ identically distributed $p$-dimensional random vectors into a $p \times n$ data matrix, we investigate the problem of testing independence among columns under the matrix-variate normal modeling of data. We propose a computationally simple and tuning-free test statistic, characterize its limiting null distribution, analyze the statistical power and prove its minimax optimality. As an important by-product of the test statistic, a ratio-consistent estimator for the quadratic functional of a covariance matrix from correlated samples is developed. We further study the effect of correlation among samples to an important high-dimensional inference problem --- large-scale multiple testing of Pearson's correlation coefficients. Indeed, blindly using classical inference results based on the assumed independence of samples will lead to many false discoveries, which suggests the need for conducting independence testing before applying existing methods. To address the challenge arising from correlation among samples, we propose a ""sandwich estimator"" of Pearson's correlation coefficient by de-correlating the samples. Based on this approach, the resulting multiple testing procedure asymptotically controls the overall false discovery rate at the nominal level while maintaining good statistical power. Both simulated and real data experiments are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xi Chen"", ids = ""49794791""); list(name = ""Weidong Liu"", ids = ""40474857"")",283d417873bcac56b6a7ac9a50ac4a3d61b077af; 34b03c591b1a14e569ac3595a4bac4b1981b3092; 3f72fec878ceadd7d00b46117a986ab4527b631c; e8ed644dbea86480377abbd4c0d2d96454ba9fc1,d06b7e6be29669329b331a538bdcaf0fdd0a55f2; 684905e57b881e219b983d2f0c17e47a853e63e3; 68a36242b2447dec091d2519f2c88b1317268546; 7b52d0dc1faebd61bd69231b91b920372254a8d4; a420f5c88a913a48ce1de96d5a267e9ceea36e0c; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; ea421ccff0d7a0a52369ca24a959911ba741cc0b; c8d4be093cd4da26f0402b6b9b2680d7ffae2959; e08324785f6d64204132f2a2890460e2b0442836; c5bed0cb7dccbf76c344413aa207d117be7e1bf5; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; 865b1607a955f9fca1b46425a4c10e8fa79e3397; e73160905437198889fbabe9a93d8303174fb01f; 4406c54f40e0f73db2180704d454951649df32f2; d1747f8eb0b3fc7616c3f7dda3cbce27eb7936cd; 0a1cf2140c4d52a78aebaf85d83fb18bdb9b920a; bc890cd58854edd1710f0565b3874e2c2c3c9899; e3e071378c266e9005aef13c0bd76275aed77536; c3e6c03109dd437ef2e3f47bcb32a40b76cd1ace; 48357eaa6dd8e31536316d7006c32e6a66e36ccb; a6ced174c1f2f5b8e5db487e106342f94f4d7f0b; 8b510ecae4ac63445d6c46f5c9f2d7716e1f1455; 43df40940722c09a776248ab4a090774dd29b704; fa71e9be096919b8f1951da27f64ca9ac7ccf439; 20cc8b64867643ac9311028ec3bb7c4074c5eb28,Annals of Statistics,46,866-894
a4c9fe4fc43d1179dba5a26935fb0c805125b3c3,Computer aided detection in prostate cancer diagnostics: A promising alternative to biopsy? A retrospective study from 104 lesions with histological ground truth,"BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by means of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a current challenge for the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) tools. An innovative CAD-software (Watson Elementaryâ„¢) was proposed to achieve high sensitivity and specificity, as well as to allege a correlate to Gleason grade.


AIM/OBJECTIVE
To assess the performance of Watson Elementaryâ„¢ in automated PCa diagnosis in our hospitalÂ´s database of MRI-guided prostate biopsies.


METHODS
The evaluation was retrospective for 104 lesions (47 PCa, 57 benign) from 79, 64.61Â±6.64 year old patients using 3T T2-weighted imaging, Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps and dynamic contrast enhancement series. Watson Elementaryâ„¢ utilizes signal intensity, diffusion properties and kinetic profile to compute a proportional Gleason grade predictor, termed Malignancy Attention Index (MAI). The analysis focused on (i) the CAD sensitivity and specificity to classify suspect lesions and (ii) the MAI correlation with the histopathological ground truth.


RESULTS
The software revealed a sensitivity of 46.80% for PCa classification. The specificity for PCa was found to be 75.43% with a positive predictive value of 61.11%, a negative predictive value of 63.23% and a false discovery rate of 38.89%. CAD classified PCa and benign lesions with equal probability (P 0.06, Ï‡2 test). Accordingly, receiver operating characteristic analysis suggests a poor predictive value for MAI with an area under curve of 0.65 (P 0.02), which is not superior to the performance of board certified observers. Moreover, MAI revealed no significant correlation with Gleason grade (P 0.60, PearsonÂ´s correlation).


CONCLUSION

f55bac2b998da29070a054fd1621e02804eaff78,TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL LONGITUDINAL DATA By,"This paper concerns statistical inference for longitudinal data with ultrahigh dimensional covariates. We first study the problem of constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for a low dimensional parameter of interest. The major challenge is how to construct a powerful test statistic in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters and sophisticated within-subject correlation of longitudinal data. To deal with the challenge, we propose a new quadratic decorrelated inference function approach, which simultaneously removes the impact of nuisance parameters and incorporates the correlation to enhance the efficiency of the estimation procedure. When the parameter of interest is of fixed dimension, we prove that the proposed estimator is asymptotically normal and attains the semiparametric information bound, based on which we can construct an optimal Wald test statistic. We further extend this result and establish the limiting distribution of the estimator under the setting with the dimension of the parameter of interest growing with the sample size at a polynomial rate. Finally, we study how to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when a vector of high-dimensional regression parameters is of interest. We prove that applying the Storey (2002)â€™s procedure to the proposed test statistics for each regression parameter controls FDR asymptotically in longitudinal data. We conduct simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed procedures. Our simulation results imply that the newly proposed procedure can control both Type I error for testing a low dimensional parameter of interest and the FDR in the multiple testing problem. We also apply the proposed procedure to a real data example.",2019,,"list(name = ""Ethan X.

This inversion on chromosome 16 creates a fusion gene CBFb-MYH11 and leads to the expression of a fusion protein CBFÎ²-SMMHC. Expression of CbfÎ²-SMMHC (CM) in a conditional Cbfb-MYH11 knock-in mouse model ( Cbfb +/56M /Mx1-Cre ) leads to development of spontaneous AML with the acquisition of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations. In order to further understand the underlying mechanism(s) driving leukemogenesis and identify predictive biomarkers during disease progression, we performed RNA-seq to track changes of transcriptiome in time series peripheral blood samples using illumina HiSeq sequencer. A cohort of 16 mice were included in the experiment, 9 out of which are CM conditional knock-in mice and the remaining 7 are controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected before the induction of CM expression as the ""0"" time point samples. After induction, peripheral blood samples were collected at 1, 2, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 month (experimental end point) after induction, and leukemic samples were collected when mice were moribund as the ""end"" time point samples. Between 3.5 and 6.5 months, 6 out of 9 CM knock-in mice in this cohort had succumbed to lethal leukemia. Total RNA was isolated for mRNA and microRNA (miR) sequencing library preparation. The mapped sequencing read counts were annotated to genes and differential expression was compared using edgeR. False discovery rate (FDR) were used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Genes with adjusted P value (FDR) 2 were considered differentially expressed genes. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed that all diseased mice showed unique disease-related mRNA and miRNA signatures at the end point. The disease-related signatures were absent in all control mice and the three CM conditional knock-in mice that did not develop leukemia. We found that 2,032 mRNA genes and 106 miRs were significantly up-regulated whereas 2,926 mRNA genes and 121 miRs were significantly down-regulated at the leukemia end point. Principal component analysis revealed that the disease-related changes occur quite early, at 1-2 month after induction. Among the earliest changes, miR-126-3p and miR-126-5p, previously reported to be associated with human inv(16) AML, were significantly up-regulated (log fold change =2.09 and 2.36 respectively; p + AML and treated with with anti-miR126 (5 mg/kg, daily, 30 days) had a significant delay in leukemia progression and enhanced survival (control 42% survival v.s. anti-miR-126 80% survival at 70 days; n=7-10), supporting the notion that high miR-126 contributes to disease growth. Further mechanistic investigation of miR-126 function during inv(16) AML progression are ongoing. In conclusion, transcriptome analysis of time series samples during spontaneous leukemia progression allows identification of disease-related changes and early increase of miR-126 as a potential biomarker. Further functional validation is expected to provide mechanistic insights and rational for targeting miR-126 in inv(16) AML.

aa3cc8d08f7e0b7c30b6fa5bd848f60851b884a1,A note on the false discovery rate of novel peptides in proteogenomics,"MOTIVATION
Proteogenomics has been well accepted as a tool to discover novel genes. In most conventional proteogenomic studies, a global false discovery rate is used to filter out false positives for identifying credible novel peptides. However, it has been found that the actual level of false positives in novel peptides is often out of control and behaves differently for different genomes.


RESULTS
To quantitatively model this problem, we theoretically analyze the subgroup false discovery rates of annotated and novel peptides. Our analysis shows that the annotation completeness ratio of a genome is the dominant factor influencing the subgroup FDR of novel peptides. Experimental results on two real datasets of Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis support our conjecture.

96136fce5e4f99cc109d9a13b7601986e0e200dc,Author ' s personal copy Stress e response pathways are altered in the hippocampus of chronic alcoholics,"The chronic high-level alcohol consumption seen in alcoholism leads to dramatic effects on the hippocampus, including decreased white matter, loss of oligodendrocytes and other glial cells, and inhibition of neurogenesis. Examining gene expression in post mortem hippocampal tissue from 20 alcoholics and 19 controls allowed us to detect differentially expressed genes that may play a role in the risk for alcoholism or whose expression is modified by chronic consumption of alcohol. We identified 639 named genes whose expression significantly differed between alcoholics and controls at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) 0.20; 52% of these genes differed by at least 1.2-fold. Differentially expressed genes included the glucocorticoid receptor and the related gene FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8), urea transporter (SLC14A1), zinc transporter (SLC39A10), Interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), and many metallothioneins. Pathways related to inflammation, hypoxia, and stress showed activation, and pathways that play roles in neurogenesis and myelination showed decreases. The cortisol pathway dysregulation and increased inflammation identified here are seen in other stress-related conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and most likely play a role in addiction. Many of the detrimental effects on the hippocampus appear to be mediated through NF-kB signaling. Twenty-four of the differentially regulated genes were previously identified by genome-wide association studies of alcohol use disorders; this raises the potential interest of genes not normally associated with alcoholism, such as suppression of tumorigenicity 18 (ST18), BCL2associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), and von Willebrand factor (VWF). 2013 Elsevier Inc.

179c9bab8953d60ab003fa5ee4f8270a017ecffc,Identification of a gene signature of a pre-transformation process by senescence evasion in normal human epidermal keratinocytes,"BackgroundEpidemiological data show that the incidence of carcinomas in humans is highly dependent on age. However, the initial steps of the age-related molecular oncogenic processes by which the switch towards the neoplastic state occurs remain poorly understood, mostly due to the absence of powerful models. In a previous study, we showed that normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) spontaneously and systematically escape from senescence to give rise to pre-neoplastic emerging cells.MethodsHere, this model was used to analyze the gene expression profile associated with the early steps of age-related cell transformation. We compared the gene expression profiles of growing or senescent NHEKs to post-senescent emerging cells. Data analyses were performed by using the linear modeling features of the limma package, resulting in a two-sided t test or F-test based on moderated statistics. The p-values were adjusted for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate according to Benjamini Hochberg method.The common gene set resulting of differential gene expression profiles from these two comparisons revealed a post-senescence neoplastic emergence (PSNE) gene signature of 286 genes.ResultsAbout half of these genes were already reported as involved in cancer or premalignant skin diseases. However, bioinformatics analyses did not highlight inside this signature canonical cancer pathways but metabolic pathways, including in first line the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450. In order to validate the relevance of this signature as a signature of pretransformation by senescence evasion, we invalidated two components of the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. When performed at the beginning of the senescence plateau, this invalidation did not alter the senescent state itself but significantly decreased the frequency of PSNE. Conversely, overexpression of AKR1C2 but not AKR1C3 increased the frequency of PSNE.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this study is the first to identify reprogrammation of metabolic pathways in normal keratinocytes as a potential determinant of the switch from senescence to pre-transformation.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nathalie Martin"", ids = ""50116319""); list(name = ""Clara Salazar-Cardozo"", ids = ""1402953688""); list(name = ""Chantal Vercamer"", ids = ""6181767""); list(name = ""Louise Ott"", ids = ""14038704""); list(name = ""Guillemette Marot"", ids = ""47797021""); list(name = ""Predrag Slijepcevic"", ids = ""6946488""); list(name = ""Corinne Abbadie"", ids = ""39129593""); list(name = ""Olivier Pluquet"", ids = ""47494580"")",54717b39cf327bb3910caee07eeba20ff3e164a4; 3c5b0fa0bb6d6678f150fb9c37795588c69cf089; 441646d4e1fdce32cde0a5829cf7b66134e4bb81; b99cc657b0caa309afe73e323cb1179cf82d9996; 5a63d39ffc62699d8a5f1cda6e6dcd610abed4b3,bc5a78c65dc49a2dd0cfaa7e56fa2f998d1cf756; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; fe9c2e4ea0df7d87f2b393d16d5322c06f8b0624; 0cd332944f015cdef3471735f3aa26d869710f6c; 1880c5c505ea17d615f32402cbb513ea2c31ac6a; 993e327b445d251a91f3d5034f8d9f4318d2dc32; 117c4c2d86bd6fca27f096ef483b70c9a5e9afad; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; fa8dd541021c9d30bbec217d3a80709ff9277e56; e132007c2148b6cf1f246519d7cd19d794527adb; 47dfb133c5da318ab809f134eee03e9f91475991; dedcbb7d97cc5d7e0bdd079da30eaa936af73474; daf8ebed8b037b104b8cd36a878dde8da31c6bc5; a5f9a86c1f8e7ecc924901af40075776b3e7a4e8; 3d8e0a11881bf3deb24ec3a40b67fe442b52b3a1; ee62f38ed93c5917d1fc835bfd9b2856b40577c7; 52b13bc31833941606915620ac45275bb334e77f; c6148c0189975c1831951a8f6f6e1de97853166e; 9484b4d64a0a844e029b8e11f59b9ca3292f2346; 40bf24c37f10e94bbad867ac1bdfefb0dc470c50; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 77b4dfe4c002d581104ab87c531a97048202183e; 234d809ae62f90afe8eaf9cc342e7ef691dd188d; f38226cd905c72512bccdd892d5dfcd17c6425c5; 2ddb830a07ddc08bde960959777e4a2e5ebfb2c8; c3a1ebe5e9b50a9a33a6e469d56bac202f5a7a77; e435561b058b3ba8d1bed53ad62efe6caef48e50; df691b7074a5c112297256f4f8835e4c15489fd7; 729d7cbef00e58571b493cd8ad2b53f1e0bffe98; 6e38a2c9fcc3a3bded61a28740aeb7f93ed7f485; 338fbe4af9c90d960173d36c294db8b8cef61658; 3b6d67de5d43d97c82cd9b6901400a0d97dbdba1; b552c480093d191640b446a3d5b202f68fc94f87; 85adb8dc6e3f3e9210382c7281ac0ac91f367006; e8040e95517e7c1602a25724c6089d9948b15033; 3eb88f374f7c039629ac3af7ff8c8cfedffff918,Molecular Cancer,13,151 - 151

There has been growing interest in using chemoradiation (CRT) for non-operative management of rectal cancer, and identifying patients who might benefit most from this approach is crucial. This study identified miRNAs (miRs) associated with clinical outcomes and treatment resistance by evaluating both pre- and post-CRT expression profiles.


Methods
Forty patients, 9 with pathologic complete response (pCR) and 31 with pathologic incomplete response (pIR) were included. MicroRNA was extracted from 40 pre-therapy tumor samples and 31 post-chemoradiation surgical samples with pathologic incomplete response (pIR). A generalized linear model was used to identify miRs associated with pCR. A linear mixed effects model was used to identify miRs differentially expressed before and after treatment. miR expression was dichotomized at the mean and clinical outcomes were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard modeling.


Results
Nine miRs were associated with pCR (p<0.05), but none were significant after false discovery rate correction. Among patients with pIR, 68 miRs were differentially expressed between the pre and post-CRT groups (FDR p<0.05). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) demonstrated multiple signaling networks associated with pIR, including p38MAPK, TP53, AKT, IL-6, and RAS. Increased let-7b was correlated with increased distant metastasis (DM), worse relapse-free survival (RFS), and worse overall survival (OS) (p<0.05).


Conclusions
No miRs were significantly correlated with pCR. We identified miRs that were differentially expressed between pre- and post-CRT tumor samples, and these miRs implicated multiple signaling pathways that may confer resistance to CRT.

93c2f2889ce5a2a3bb30bcbe67f6f3f71721e267,Association of genetic variants with myocardial infarction in Japanese individuals with or without metabolic syndrome.,"The etiology of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly complex, with both genetic and environmental factors being thought to play an important role. Although MetS has been recognized as a risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), the genetic risk for MI in individuals with or without MetS has remained uncharacterized. We examined a possible association of genetic variants with MI in individuals with or without MetS separately. The study population comprised 4,424 individuals, including 1,918 individuals with MetS (903 subjects with MI and 1,015 controls) and 2,506 individuals without MetS (499 subjects with MI and 2,007 controls). The 150 polymorphisms examined in the present study were selected by genome-wide association studies of MI and ischemic stroke with the use of Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set. Initial screening by the Chi-square test revealed that the Câ†’T polymorphism (rs1794429) of LRPAP1, the Aâ†’G polymorphism (rs12373237) of LAMA3 and the Aâ†’G polymorphism (rs3782257) of NCOR2 were significantly (false discovery rate of <0.05) associated with MI for individuals with MetS, and that the Câ†’G polymorphism (rs13051704) of TFF1 was significantly related to MI for individuals without MetS. Subsequent multivariable logistic analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that rs1794429 of LRPAP1 (recessive model; P=0.0218; odds ratio=0.71) and rs3782257 of NCOR2 (dominant model; P=0.0057; odds ratio=1.94) were significantly associated with MI among individuals with MetS, and that rs13051704 of TFF1 (additive model; P=0.0100; odds ratio=0.55) was significantly associated with MI among individuals without MetS. The genetic variants that confer susceptibility to MI differ between individuals with or without MetS.

cac31fe1bc950af7efa1dcce8ffa64add25da2dc,SimSeq: a nonparametric approach to simulation of RNA-sequence datasets,"MOTIVATION
RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method.


RESULTS
We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the user. We conduct simulation experiments based on the negative binomial distribution and our proposed nonparametric simulation algorithm. We compare performance between the two simulation experiments over a small subset of statistical methods for RNA-seq analysis available in the literature. We use as a benchmark the ability of a method to control the false discovery rate. Not surprisingly, methods based on parametric modeling assumptions seem to perform better with respect to false discovery rate control when data are simulated from parametric models rather than using our more realistic nonparametric simulation strategy.

39c860e8a55973d5ee754565f58c6f158e0da7db,Alterations in urinary metabolomic profiles due to lead exposure from a lead-acid battery recycling site.,"Lead poisoning is considered a public health threat, particularly in developing countries. Health problems from Pb exposure occur in many parts of the world, especially near Pb mines, Pb smelters, and used lead-acid battery (ULAB) recycling plants. In this study, we analyzed the urine metabolome of residents in a village located near a ULAB recycling facility to investigate the biological effects of Pb exposure (ULAB: nâ€¯=â€¯44, Reference: nâ€¯=â€¯51). Lasso linear regression models were moderately predictive of blood Pb levels, as evaluated by a training set (R2â€¯=â€¯0.813) and against an external test set (R2EXTâ€¯=â€¯0.647). In lasso logistic regression models, areas under receiver operating characteristic curves, as measured by 5-fold cross-validation (AUCCVâ€¯=â€¯0.871) and against an external test set (AUCEXTâ€¯=â€¯0.917), indicated accurate classification of urine samples from the affected village and from a reference site. Ten candidate biomarkers identified at false discovery rates of <0.05 were associated with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, possibly related to the disruption of small-molecule transport in the kidney; amino acid, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism; and the heme biosynthetic pathway. Collectively, the results suggest that lead Pb is related to the health effects in individuals residing in ULAB site by alteration of these biological pathways.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Akifumi Eguchi"", ids = ""5469504""); list(name = ""Kei Nomiyama"", ids = ""35356007""); list(name = ""Kenichi Sakurai"", ids = ""143840630""); list(name = ""Pham Thi Kim Trang"", ids = ""14320457""); list(name = ""Pham Hung Viet"", ids = ""79904970""); list(name = ""Shin Hadano Takahashi"", ids = ""2156983""); list(name = ""Hisato Iwata"", ids = ""46494479""); list(name = ""Shinsuke Tanabe"", ids = ""34873178""); list(name = ""Emiko Todaka"", ids = ""3756645""); list(name = ""Chisato Mori"", ids = ""50853004"")",a97f151feea9d6ee07d6516591bb2dee911ac514; 9d519226ef161f2bd7c32810b1ef3075963f510e,,Environmental pollution,242 Pt A,"

5ce8af62c106416184a660a7c4cc1b892d7b7615,The effect of search accuracy on shotgun protemoics results using a validated protein database and high resolution fragment spectra,"Mass spectrometry based proteomics has become one of the most powerful tools used to determine protein structure, function, and expression. The recent rapid expansion of the field is a result of significant improvements in the throughput of mass spectrometers and the availability of affordable and powerful computers. Due to the improvements to mass spectrometers, LCMS/MS experiments are able to generate tens of thousands of MS/MS spectra making automated interpretation a necessity. The results of automated database searches must be scrutinized very carefully. In this study, the incidence of false positives from search results was explicitly measured by using a database annotated with randomly generated proteins. True positives were measured as the identification of a subset of individually validated recombinant proteins that were spiked into the experimental sample. Searches were performed under a variety of high and low mass accuracy settings, and the performance of a few methods of statistical validation was analyzed. This investigation shows that post-search statistical validation should be a mandatory step in a shotgun proteomics experiment. Furthermore, high resolution mass accuracy and resolution ion fragment scanning should be used as soon as mass spectrometers can operate in those modes without significant losses to scan times and throughput.

9f97e49a8411a1c3e9e7fcb87d1aa3b17074df20,"Statistical Analysis of the TSAD Interactome in Multiple Sclerosis: Multiple Testing, High Dimensional Regression and Interactions","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inï¬‚ammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS). The presence of Oligoclonal Band (OCB) in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is an important diagnostic tool in MS. The main aim of this study was to determine SNPs and SNPs-SNPs interactions in the genomic TSAD (T-Cell Specific Adaptor Proteins) region which explain the difference between two MS conditions: OCB positive vs. OCB negative in sampled Norwegian patients. The data to this study was obtained from the MS Registry Ulleval University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Of 899 patients, 802 were OCB positive and 97 OCB negative, each has 923 SNPs at speciï¬c position in their chromosome measure. The study incorporated two different statistical methods to our data analysis. First, we apply variable selection based on Lasso method, here we discuss Lasso for Logistic Regression Analysis and see interaction effect for the Lasso selected SNPs. In the second section, we analyze variable selection based on test of association. Here, we used Chi-Square and Fisherâ€™s exact test of association to see association between the statuses of OCB to each SNP. We found out that the Chi-Square test of association selected 34 signiï¬cant SNPs and the association test for Fisherâ€™s exact test selected 38 signiï¬cant SNPs at signiï¬cance level of 0.05. Then we used Boferroni and False Discovery Rate to statistically signiï¬cant SNPs for the multiple testing corrections. Finally, we looked for interaction effects to some selected SNPs from test of association and we have determined SNPs and SNP-SNP interactions which appear to have signiï¬cant associated to the OCB subpopulation of MS patients, based on our study of the Norwegian cohort. These are selected SNPs which have been selected by any of the methods that we used (various hypothesis testing and regressions). This is the SNPs that we think should be studied further and validated on a new dataset. Of particular importance are the seven SNP-SNP interactions which we found. It is the ï¬rst time a SNP-SNP study has been performed on these data, and the ï¬nding will be communicated to the Norwegian molecular biologists to be followed up.

1b390b48abe5218dcd92f1164bc5ff78b1301e47,Nonlinear gene cluster analysis with labeling for microarray gene expression data in organ development,"BackgroundThe gene networks underlying closure of the optic fissure during vertebrate eye development are not well-understood. We use a novel clustering method based on nonlinear dimension reduction with data labeling to analyze microarray data from laser capture microdissected (LCM) cells at the site and developmental stages (days 10.5 to 12.5) of optic fissure closure.ResultsOur nonlinear methods created clusters of genes that mapped onto more specific biological processes and functions related to eye development as defined by Gene Ontology at lower false discovery rates than conventional linear cluster algorithms. Our new methods build on the advantages of LCM to isolate pure phenotypic populations within complex tissues in order to identify systems biology relationships among critical gene products expressed at lower copy number.ConclusionsThe combination of LCM of embryonic organs, gene expression microarrays, and nonlinear dimension reduction with labeling is a potentially useful approach to extract subtle spatial and temporal co-variations within the gene regulatory networks that specify mammalian organogenesis and organ function. Our results motivate further analysis of nonlinear dimension reduction with labeling within other microarray data sets from LCM dissected tissues or other cell specific samples to determine the more general utility of our method for uncovering more specific biological functional relationships.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin Ehler"", ids = ""1845331""); list(name = ""Vinodh N.

da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800,A stochastic process approach to false discovery control,"This paper extends the theory of false discovery rates (FDR) pioneered by Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser B 57 (1995) 289-300]. We develop a framework in which the False Discovery Proportion (FDP)-the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections-is treated as a stochastic process. After obtaining the limiting distribution of the process, we demonstrate the validity of a class of procedures for controlling the False Discovery Rate (the expected FDP). We construct a confidence envelope for the whole FDP process. From these envelopes we derive confidence thresholds, for controlling the quantiles of the distribution of the FDP as well as controlling the number of false discoveries. We also investigate methods for estimating the p-value distribution.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Christopher R. Genovese"", ids = ""2264370""); list(name = ""Larry A.

88d3bc0fa1beb36ddd5266a6db09a48bda4098a7,Impact of low and high tidal volumes on the rat alveolar epithelial type II cell proteome.,"RATIONALE
Mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes leads to increased permeability, generation of inflammatory mediators, and damage to alveolar epithelial cells (ATII).


OBJECTIVES
To identify changes in the ATII proteome after two different ventilation strategies in rats.


METHODS
Rats (n = 6) were ventilated for 5 hours with high- and low tidal volumes (VTs) (high VT: 20 ml/kg; low VT: 6 ml/kg). Pooled nonventilated rats served as control animals. ATII cells were isolated and lysed, and proteins were tryptically cleaved into peptides. Cellular protein content was evaluated by peptide labeling of the ventilated groups with (18)O. Samples were fractionated by cation exchange chromatography and identified using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins identified by 15 or more peptides were statistically compared using t tests corrected for the false discovery rate.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
High Vt resulted in a significant increase in airspace neutrophils without an increase in extravascular lung water. Compared with low-VT samples, high-VT samples showed a 32% decrease in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3 receptor (p < 0.01), a 34% decrease in Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (p < 0.01), and a significantly decreased content in ATP synthase chains. Even low-VT samples displayed significant changes, including a 66% decrease in heat shock protein 90-beta (p < 0.01) and a 67% increase in mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase (p < 0.01). Significant differences were found in membrane, acute phase, structural, and mitochondrial proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
After short-term exposure to high-VT ventilation, significant reductions in membrane receptors, ion channel proteins, enzymes of the mitochondrial energy system, and structural proteins in ATII cells were present. The data supports the two-hit concept that an unfavorable ventilatory strategy may make the lung more vulnerable to an additional insult.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jan Hirsch"", ids = ""48229365""); list(name = ""Kirk C.

As an extension of the original LuciPHOr (version 1) for phosphorylation site localization, the new software provides a site-level localization score for generic PTMs and associated false discovery rate called the false localization rate. We describe several novel features such as operating system independence and reduced computation time through multiple threading. We also discuss optimal parameters for different types of data and illustrate the new tool on a human skeletal muscle dataset for lysine-acetylation.

37dd792d44fde1829efb5fa82ad8486bd64e93f1,"A gene expression study of normal and damaged cartilage in anteromedial gonarthrosis, a phenotype of osteoarthritis","OBJECTIVE
To identify osteoarthritis (OA) relevant genes and pathways in damaged and undamaged cartilage isolated from the knees of patients with anteromedial gonarthrosis (AMG) - a specific form of knee OA.


DESIGN
Cartilage was obtained from nine patients undergoing unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) for AMG. AMG provides a spatial representation of OA progression; showing a reproducible and histologically validated pattern of cartilage destruction such that damaged and undamaged cartilage from within the same knee can be consistently isolated and examined. Gene expression was analysed by microarray and validated using real-time PCR.


RESULTS
Damaged and undamaged cartilage showed distinct gene expression profiles. 754 genes showed significant up- or down-regulation (non-False discovery rate (FDR) P < 0.05) with enrichment for genes involved in cell signalling, Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and inflammatory response. A number of genes previously unreported in OA showed strongly altered expression including RARRES3, ADAMTSL2 and DUSP10. Confirmation of genes previously identified as modulated in OA was also obtained e.g., SFRP3, MMP3 and IGF1.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to examine a common and consistent phenotype of OA to allow direct comparison of damaged and undamaged cartilage from within the same joint compartment. We have identified specific gene expression profiles in damaged and undamaged cartilage and have determined relevant genes and pathways in OA progression.

a324b74000f6a6c0ac2289cf1cc0b3157297a10e,Polymorphisms and Noncardioembolic Stroke in Three Case-Control Studies,"Background: Gene variants associated with disease could reveal novel mechanisms. We searched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with noncardioembolic stroke (nonCES). Methods: We tested 24,926 SNPs in or near genes for association with nonCES in the Vienna Study (551 cases, 815 controls) and then evaluated the associated SNPs in the UCSF-CC Study (570 cases, 1,604 controls) first in pooled DNA samples and then in individual DNA samples. We then asked whether the risk alleles of the SNPs associated with increased risk in both studies were also associated with increased risk of nonCES in the German Study (728 cases, 1,041 controls). Results: Six of the 46 SNPs that were associated with nonCES in both the Vienna and the UCSF-CC Studies were also associated with nonCES in the German Study: rs362277 in HTT (OR 1.39, 90% CI 1.12â€“1.71), rs2924914 near CSMD1 (OR 1.22, 90% CI 1.04â€“1.43), rs1264352 near DDR1 (OR 1.20, 90% CI 1.02â€“1.41), rs544115 in NEU3 (OR 1.63, 90% CI 1.02â€“2.62), rs12481805 in UMODL1 (OR 1.31, 90% CI 1.01â€“1.81), and rs2857595 near NCR3 (OR 1.15, 90% CI 1.00â€“1.32). Accounting for multiple testing of 46 SNPs, these 6 SNPs had a false discovery rate of 0.69. Conclusions: Some of the 6 SNPs may be associated with nonCES but most may be false positives. These 6 SNPs merit investigation in additional nonCES study populations.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""May M.

5b6ebe6da6b76ef0118dd9ae279f70b06dcf16c0,False Discovery Rate Control and Statistical Quality Assessment of Annotators in Crowdsourced Ranking,"With the rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms it has become easy and relatively inexpensive to collect a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short time. However due to the lack of control over the quality of the annotators, some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which can potentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we introduce a statistical framework to model and detect annotator's position bias in order to control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge on the amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical development relies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithms based on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics whose discretization is potentially suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively studying annotator's abnormal behavior in crowdsourcing data arising from machine learning, sociology, computer vision, multimedia, etc.",2016,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Qianqian Xu"", ids = ""34679664""); list(name = ""Jiechao Xiong"", ids = ""3081531""); list(name = ""Xiaochun Cao"", ids = ""1719250""); list(name = ""Yuan Yao"", ids = ""144779803"")",f0ac2c3b980f799e1a559e177eba3254aae0c509; 7bc321df9a5f7b26f68311804ffae98c1f647b9e; ebf4e22d32cde5b287097960a2028bca535c2559; bebab164c93f94f47c1418e97fc217111c2beb77; e64aebf95824d03729d620249678d63225e46037; 12bd6f65cb549590c8dd62686dffbd7ddff79651,97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 472500bb0fc49354445b25f851905dda621a42d0; 199dcbb1e5287eedb458c867b171cc83c06b0d2a; 5b150e8632e242d6026b50db55dba54992f15ed8; cbec6f6e3c1493a403e8b66134977e0c93743733; 154df96b95e8b9635771442244fe48b125933bb1; a0360cb54a62f4ada3232a7e702a7bd21180266a; 4a749f461a4194f1d42d06bdd3071dd19b03ac26; 4e227d4919caa1780ec2cd67e834430037e294bb; 15e1cfc1d9e6765ac6d02813d040ae0a215d664b; a3f853572e12b51c4c227590168c95b7cd0ca666; 5d45e2cbe8cff587ea9ca4d6d8584757b8b6c311; 13902735833da99a06d59d9e372becec7309410f; 73556d293408317e8f7169d5ca1c266bbefae97f; 04099ed11a99201cb30480b3b11254c5f9c78e83; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a9f90916ce2d048f99d7d0d4e7dd5c1c723e6076; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 91ecef06c5338ba321428a953a038f7a163e56de; fbc6b3d3abee19aa0b29b6f3e26b499621597472; a9f118ad445adb6de6d8fc14948fe105b4eb8b54; 8ff7b7cf3849640b7cfb8f08e2946fd151fed34c; 906ed11d6431ff32e90476c0acade160ab1c9a70; 0165568bcc1a819c18564567f2ec15d859be2519; a7c828184693a453a6c2867dee233ed054b2012e; df299fc6d430c6f3f39bc9e8db5b27a92960f7dc; 7f8e23084ccf359b28d5bd0f5cb6c7e8a45c76f7,,,1282-1291
eb4ce3c56fd44aca422e957180b755dbbef6dbf8,Ultra-High-Resolution Imaging of Amygdala Subnuclei Structural Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder.,"BACKGROUND
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an increasingly common and disabling illness. As the amygdala has been reported to have pathological involvement in mood disorders, we aimed to investigate for the first time potential changes to structural connectivity of individual amygdala subnuclei in MDD using ultra-high-field 7T diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.


METHODS
Twenty-four patients with MDD (11 women) and 24 age-matched healthy control participants (7 women) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging with a 1.05-mm isotropic resolution at 7T. Amygdala nuclei regions of interest were obtained through automated segmentation of 0.69-mm resolution T1-weighted images and 0.35-mm resolution T2-weighted images. Probabilistic tractography was performed on all subjects, with random seeding at each amygdala nucleus.


RESULTS
The right lateral, basal, central, and centrocortical amygdala nuclei exhibited significantly increased connection density to the rest of the brain, whereas the left medial nucleus demonstrated significantly lower connection density (false discovery rate p < .05). Increased connection density in the right lateral and basal nuclei was driven by the stria terminalis, and the significant difference in the right central nucleus was driven by the uncinate fasciculus. Decreased connection density at the left medial nucleus did not appear to be driven by any individual white matter tract.


CONCLUSIONS
By exploiting ultra-high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, structural hyperconnectivity was demonstrated involving the amygdaloid nuclei in the right hemisphere in MDD. To a lesser extent, impairment of subnuclei connectivity was shown in the left hemisphere.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephanie G. Brown"", ids = ""145477743""); list(name = ""John W.

098d19ab05aa876adf8b4bf90fa423e710c5f228,Clinical chorioamnionitis at term IV: the maternal plasma cytokine profile,"Abstract Introduction: Fever is a major criterion for clinical chorioamnionitis; yet, many patients with intrapartum fever do not have demonstrable intra-amniotic infection. Some cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), can induce a fever. The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal plasma concentrations of cytokines could be of value in the identification of patients with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis at term who have microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted, including patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term (n=41; cases) and women in spontaneous labor at term without clinical chorioamnionitis (n=77; controls). Women with clinical chorioamnionitis were classified into three groups according to the results of amniotic fluid culture, broad-range polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS), and amniotic fluid IL-6 concentration: 1) no intra-amniotic inflammation; 2) intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms; or 3) microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation. The maternal plasma concentrations of 29 cytokines were determined with sensitive and specific V-PLEX immunoassays. Nonparametric statistical methods were used for analysis, adjusting for a false discovery rate of 5%. Results: 1) The maternal plasma concentrations of pyrogenic cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFN-Î³, and TNF-Î±) were significantly higher in patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term than in those with spontaneous term labor without clinical chorioamnionitis; 2) the maternal plasma concentrations of cytokines were not significantly different among the three subgroups of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis (intra-amniotic inflammation with and without detectable bacteria and those without intra-amniotic inflammation); and 3) among women with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis, but without evidence of intra-amniotic inflammation, the maternal plasma concentrations of pyrogenic cytokines were significantly higher than in patients with spontaneous labor at term. These observations suggest that a fever can be mediated by increased circulating concentrations of these cytokines, despite the absence of a local intra-amniotic inflammatory response. Conclusions: 1) The maternal plasma concentrations of pyrogenic cytokines (e.g. IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IFN-Î³, and TNF-Î±) are higher in patients with intra-partum fever and the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis at term than in those in spontaneous labor at term without a fever; and 2) maternal plasma cytokine concentrations have limited value in the identification of patients with bacteria in the amniotic cavity.

In this review, we begin with an overview of the major challenges GÃ—E studies have faced (e.g., difficulties replicating findings and high false discovery rates). In light of these challenges, this review focuses on describing examples in which we might begin to understand GÃ—Es on the molecular, cellular, circuit, and behavioral level and link this interaction to altered risk for the development of psychiatric disorders. We also describe recent studies that utilize a polygenic approach to examine GÃ—Es. Finally, we discuss how gaining a deeper understanding of GÃ—Es may translate into a therapeutic practice with more targeted treatments.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thorhildur Halldorsdottir"", ids = ""5495286""); list(name = ""Elisabeth B.

6846f235f726c74b5419b30104955301270fbcd9,Genome-wide association study and in silico functional analysis of the number of embryos produced by Holstein donors.,"Superovulation or ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization are technologies used to produce an increased number of embryos from elite females. Embryo production traits have been shown to be heritable, but the genes that cause this variability have not yet been assessed. The main objectives of this study were to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with embryo production traits and to identify candidate genes affecting the number of embryos produced by Holstein donors in Canada that may provide insight into the regulation of embryo production. Breeding values were estimated and de-regressed for all donors and sires using a data set of 150,971 records of superovulation or ovum pick-up and in vitro fertilization. A total of 11,607 animals were genotyped, but of that number only 5,118 were genotyped with at least a 50K SNP panel and had a de-regressed estimated breeding value reliability of at least 10%. For the GWAS, 606,406 imputed SNP on 29 autosomal chromosomes were considered after applying quality control measures. A single-SNP univariate mixed linear animal model was used to perform the GWAS, and a 5% false discovery rate was applied to adjust for multiple testing. We found 36 and 14 significant SNP associated with the total number of embryos and the number of viable embryos, respectively, with most of them located on chromosome 11. Using these significant SNP, positional genes located within 10,000 bp upstream and downstream of the SNP were retrieved. Thirteen genes were harboring or near the significant SNP for the total number of embryos, 4 of them also being near the significant SNP for viable embryos. Some of these genes (CRB2, DENND1A, MAD1L1, NDUFA8, PTGS1) could be considered as potential positional candidate genes related to the number of embryos produced by a donor. This list will need to be validated in an independent population to confirm the role of the genes for embryo production.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""C Jaton"", ids = ""13479446""); list(name = ""Flavio S.

1e16fbd6d256e8d3334cb3e98c57f93182db85ab,Expanding the Psoriasis Disease Profile: Interrogation of the Skin and Serum of Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis,"Psoriasis is a complex disease with an expanding definition of its pathological features. We sought to expand/refine the psoriasis transcriptome using 85 paired lesional and non-lesional samples from a cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis vulgaris who were not receiving active psoriasis therapy. This new analysis identified 4,175 probe sets (representing 2,725 unique known genes) as being differentially expressed in psoriasis lesions compared with matched biopsies of non-lesional skin when the following criteria were applied: >2-fold change and false discovery rate <0.05. These probe sets represent the largest and most comprehensive set of genes defining psoriasis at the molecular level and within the previously unidentified genes, a link to functional pathways associated with metabolic diseases/diabetes and to cardiovascular risk pathways is identified. In addition, we profiled the serum of moderate-to-severe psoriatics compared with healthy controls to assess the overlap of overexpressed lesional genes with overexpressed systemic proteins. We identified linkage of functional pathways in lesional skin associated with metabolic diseases/diabetes and cardiovascular risk with those pathways overexpressed in the serum, suggesting a potential linkage between altered gene transcription in the skin and comorbidities commonly seen in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mayte SuÃ¡rez-FariÃ±as"", ids = ""14842374""); list(name = ""Katherine Y.

37a2c41c6aa10871e64185e0116bb5f6b0e9e740,A 63 signature genes prediction system is effective for glioblastoma prognosis,"The present study aimed to explore possible prognostic marker genes in glioblastoma (GBM). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by comparing microarray data of tumor and normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE22866. Subsequently, the prognosisâ€‘associated DEGs were screened via Cox regression analysis, followed by construction of gene/protein/pathway interaction networks of these DEGs by calculating the correlation coefficient between the DEGs. Next, a prognostic prediction system was constructed using Bayes discriminant analysis, which was validated by the microarray data of samples from patients with good and bad prognosis from the TCGA and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), as well as the GEO dataset. Finally, a coâ€‘expression network of the signature genes in the prediction system was constructed in combination with the significant pathways. A total of 288 overlapping DEGs (false discovery rate <0.5 and |log2 of fold change|>1) were screened, 123 of which were identified to be associated with the prognosis of GBM patients. The coâ€‘expression network of these prognosisâ€‘associated DEGs included 1405 interactions and 112 DEGs, and 6 functional modules were identified in the network. The prognostic prediction system was comprised of 63 signature genes with a specificity value of 0.929 and a sensitivity value of 0.948. GBM samples with good and bad prognosis in the TCGA, CGGA and GEO datasets were distinguishable by these signature genes (P=1.33x10â€‘6, 1.63x10â€‘4 and 0.00534, respectively). The coâ€‘expression network of signature genes with significant pathways was comprised of 56 genes and 361 interactions. Protein kinase CÎ³ (PRKCG), protein kinaseÂ CÎ² (PRKCB) and calcium/calmodulinâ€‘dependent protein kinase IIÎ± (CAMK2A) were important genes in the network, and based on the expression of these genes, it was possible to distinguish between samples with significantly different survival risks. In the present study, an effective prognostic prediction system for GBM patients was constructed and validated. PRKCG, PRKCB and CAMK2A may be potential prognostic factors for GBM.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""1698138""); list(name = ""Jiaming Xu"", ids = ""46372665""); list(name = ""Xiangdong Zhu"", ids = ""2223879"")",5c807eb330b116a2540b5d0f2c7fd97655dcc84b; dcad5585474c3b3944c05020017d1f163914db15; b526f4ad2b5209a9ecfc4403f60a66a5a523196d; fdc2a43faf9a138e490cf796818ffac34d573601,d251feba6722419d716f5dd0c5f3a7a15a53f1d1; 8903623dda4ab91093990e1c822982facddf6084; cb212b06ffcb854a3ac1d370d6a4a042b5885ea1; ac2b265b006e9fadd8a0b75b6b18fb74ae2fcbb3; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; e3c1c86b32d2721a85cdfe62dce50281d0144b1e; 6b54b51664ee1523bbb5b7edc5342f12f7dbd80e; cb6751ebebb8940fb6df4a27c7f4a3b5e5c2bde3; 9898595e0021b5684ff52c1502395b2e8b659b96; 8f2d4df5e76ba8ac975dcda1b8e559785a68ef78; 942ea89019b8786c4ef116b642294bba07aa1c6e; 87f5d437b9f3752eb3f2bf9d716749123f274c1f; 17b311d831b99a4effa168f32a707730d60b54b0; 72b1c753fed6fb4d21ac6c211a61954565dc4caa; baf4242996dbaef4ab37543c8db943c98b98c8be; fbfa2cfb63d1fa3ea6be9a75d6ca42b6d0e05856; ade0e42663aaa33c179376fb4d20b02ea6bf104b; 44f1369aa5dd7d81f79690c7bfc54d975be5fd1c; 13a4da56f238b7d339e9992a4d940822001392e9; 42df2b6a605a780267e56f1b57a5eae68fb41386; fef5327203ff31581b28d494981d3d641cc6ec4d; 34cc83be2f3feb9cb2a7a0dc4a6d950ebe65e7fb; 2889d713d5f890fe798196d3b9b54e2106c64387; 8a9ba9660341048e4524e69a21ac4c6bf9d8e56b; 800c751a6591d1a86788c011f1d253486405adf1; b4d8907d784983a91e4082643ed49f5a9b1e758b; 7cc6f583802e1349b76b05fbf2db87101ee09076; 9a6dba3a3f43fe12b4b91c2ccc54b1e91226e4a5; 9c5dd2e8171227c2a472a7d2f24b07e7fe2a4cf2; 10c80014ad7b133ac0469253722c6f26691e64fa; cc9e2a40ab47dc47867adeeb2d3778bc6370a87e; 5cdaffb48a59d2f37bf3dd8a3cbc991dfa4af381; 732485867ab85e883c48eae40b04c84f01e80075,International Journal of Molecular Medicine,41,2070 - 2078
2f94509d09ca3c0c54c70d57d6a99b59ded9cb09,Identification of differentially expressed genes in longissimus muscle of pigs with high and low intramuscular fat content using RNA sequencing,"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pork is an important element of consumer preference and is positively correlated with meat quality, including tenderness and juiciness. With advances in RNA sequencing technologies, transcriptome-related differences can be associated with specific traits in animals. The objective of this study was to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) closely related to IMF content in porcine longissimus muscle using RNA sequencing. A total of 107 Berkshire pigs were used for IMF content measurements, and significant differences between extremely high (H, nÂ =Â 3) and low (L, nÂ =Â 3) IMF content groups were found (PÂ <Â 0.0001). From multi-dimensional scaling analyses, it was observed that the relationships between H and L groups were similar to each other. Here, we identified a total of 134 genes that were differentially expressed between the groups (false discovery rate <0.05; fold change â‰¥2). Functional analyses with DEGs revealed that lipid metabolism (SCD and FASN) was one of the significant biological processes related to IMF content determination. In addition, we found that DEGs related to muscle regeneration (MYOG and VEGFA) and extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A1, COL14A1 and COL15A1) were changed among individuals with extreme IMF contents. These results will aid in understanding the regulation of IMF content in pigs.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyung Soo Lim"", ids = ""3504210""); list(name = ""Kyung-Tai Lee"", ids = ""34668931""); list(name = ""Jong-Eun Park"", ids = ""143792848""); list(name = ""Won-Hyong Chung"", ids = ""8663455""); list(name = ""Gul Won Jang"", ids = ""31619507""); list(name = ""Bonghwan Choi"", ids = ""14325932""); list(name = ""Kim Cheol Hong"", ids = ""31259620""); list(name = ""T H Kim"", ids = ""8880303"")",3e0b9db41d08ec1f6e8867def4b330a659caf2d7; 7200027be93eb3041b19682ea6034fddc003588f; d30b1e6b4ebc7f711e6ff0adb826f927f586cf44; 009d23a4fd55d3b0ff4b1ea987c05dee35357c3d; b2ffd05845b064cc175a453e7a858e86d1102bfe; 2aaadc1a91912ef18cbc26440c02ae1fa47a23a7; be78178e6f2e7b6e7ad5b7f2d356a494d50f60a5; d2b3d240256dfcc5fca9799043afa1e183e68642; b88456bfabad58fbf4c263907cb3574516c748b9,f9da3f8e7fa6da974756ce296fbbdd5f86cfd699; 9c0c149db8e9323c1eb0851a8d31560b3a277b8c; c0466c83267639ae5747122abd8a65682fb86f91; 287548cbb34f7f064c0fa0635343cf78f732131a; 44cfd64972dfc829806883376ebc335bbf00c7fb; 9c5ad83fbe82fe61bcce56557ebb1ec15211f1df; e32932845c59c52f14109814864bafa692ad3af0; 9874fc57c13a2075714c14cf8f58a0491ef00342; 6af9610e33940acbae76adc601c367776a389eca; c61c161cd62d53da62cc78c8179558e85c14a1ad; ce9a247ce866079b933ac289b8944c797d48e364; fc0cd00281fd4045eb2ccea7f37c6d195bfaaf45; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 6bda7ab8b001123a6f77399cdfe619e729176cc4; cbf3d7069f5c389cd38dfb431452948bb573c6ce; 41d6b3b758cf2d8af9eb9d377d27f9065de619e1; d64bc3f7eabb42c6888a94061c8fa11478a147d9; 6f010db418d12e57012b64a8562401c625357dee; 261fc4de3a991e39b11f2257cc5f84291100bcf5; 4ab1b5a0a06be862ca1c88dbc8132d33a1e60929; 4607fb16b33cd52e994cc2b2fc13a8da10f8e907; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 0f7cf571bfc1eef45be78d858f29906020a4015f; 273dce646d9e75ec638edd8e4196f2ecf8857e85; b012ca467a4cfac1fa0b0004ae86e441d1311f41; 96a37d8f5a7026fb59faac026b73e999ef2b881c; 6c8b8578f51f099687aa14dd5cc7191089f9ea69; bdee3d49c05864e15687038a068b9d279fbb1b10; 083745f96beeecf86a5024e1a7f8cb2a7c35bcc4; 17278c468b36db2d8b4b10eac71b8c5dfdad8f2e; e8c59bef9491cb11d20797b28ca30adb61c98f52; bd5b99c21142b5574f4e98de4ec3f50c41830d15; f1dd26bbd5e10b6c54635bfa2082bfe77c0e4154; dfbb3e34ffe38375aa500cb8f57307ac3035b07d; 9de11759f7ce89f55fbc51e9d7aa6d7ee755c491; 2727cd5e4d1b88c9a0c14409f00e83b9090e9918; 0b2617a4fc92c392420d60c0b9a99718f10f87e1; 1a85ceed829df9cf6842245f73ed8e55bb700887; e0a688ab3781197c78c4d92c67bea2d10d18fa3d; cba6efacc3f6a707e83ea02c359b8bfe46404496; f031c6343ab89aeb09743994029ea2c3465a93b6; ca8afdc3f12395ef4c83306d8f61d7f8e53f9ece; 7de8b5ce383f19493ec3b1407115970229885b61; da479d006a7bd5bfc02bd24e4c986882170c738d; 076fd8acf7edf88b887cd34d349b19c40f2c9e92; b1cabdda7d469faa08748be3c31227097fb2e79d; 81771e2f55b7ee105203f46fbd180511df70f4ba; d0c6b4ecb46289f15376a16ead9a31600da7d481; 80de5cd24b45efa567f94f291d19c60034cdf026,Animal Genetics,48,166â€“174
d5640134a940e1bb2125ba09abee9240b03d0654,Coupled mutation finder: A new entropy-based method quantifying phylogenetic noise for the detection of compensatory mutations,"BackgroundThe detection of significant compensatory mutation signals in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is often complicated by noise. A challenging problem in bioinformatics is remains the separation of significant signals between two or more non-conserved residue sites from the phylogenetic noise and unrelated pair signals. Determination of these non-conserved residue sites is as important as the recognition of strictly conserved positions for understanding of the structural basis of protein functions and identification of functionally important residue regions. In this study, we developed a new method, the Coupled Mutation Finder (CMF) quantifying the phylogenetic noise for the detection of compensatory mutations.ResultsTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we analyzed essential sites of two human proteins: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and glucokinase (GCK). Our results suggest that the CMF is able to separate significant compensatory mutation signals from the phylogenetic noise and unrelated pair signals. The vast majority of compensatory mutation sites found by the CMF are related to essential sites of both proteins and they are likely to affect protein stability or functionality.ConclusionsThe CMF is a new method, which includes an MSA-specific statistical model based on multiple testing procedures that quantify the error made in terms of the false discovery rate and a novel entropy-based metric to upscale BLOSUM62 dissimilar compensatory mutations. Therefore, it is a helpful tool to predict and investigate compensatory mutation sites of structural or functional importance in proteins. We suggest that the CMF could be used as a novel automated function prediction tool that is required for a better understanding of the structural basis of proteins.

8f31f1026b8e752b131f376e4b68d44775edddc0,Meta-analysis based on control of false discovery rate: combining yeast ChIP-chip datasets,"MOTIVATION
High-throughput microarray technology can be used to examine thousands of features, such as all the genes of an organism, and measure their expression. Two important issues of microarray bioinformatics are first, how to combine the significance values for each feature across experiments with high statistical power, and second, how to control the proportion of false positives. Existing methods address these issues separately, in spite of their linked usage.


RESULTS
We present a novel method (ESP) to address the two requirements in an interdependent way. It generalizes the truncated product method of Zaykin et al. to combine only those significance values which clear their respective experiment-specific false discovery restrictive thresholds, thus allowing us to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for the final combined result. Further, we introduce several concepts that together offer FDR control, high power, quality control and speed-up in meta-analysis as done by our algorithm. Computational and statistical methods of research synthesis like the one described here will be increasingly important as additional genome-wide datasets accumulate in databases.

5ef2e707249c9c54d7ca6e7e890eef3f63d9fa4b,Expression of pattern recognition receptor genes and mortality in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGER) are pattern recognition receptors that regulate intestinal inflammatory homeostasis. However, their relevance in colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis is unclear. We investigated expression of TLRs, AGER, and interacting proteins in association with CRC mortality in a retrospective cohort study of 65 males diagnosed with primary resectable CRC between 2002 and 2009. Multiplex quantitative nuclease protection assay was used to quantify the expression of 19 genes in archived tissues of tumor and paired adjacent normal mucosa. We evaluated the association between log2 (tumor/normal) expression ratios for single and combined genes and all-cause mortality using multivariable Cox regression analysis. The false discovery rate adjusted q-value less than 0.10 indicated statistical significance for single gene. Five-year survival time was calculated from diagnosis of CRC to death, lost to follow-up, or December 31, 2014. Compared to paired normal mucosa, expression levels of AGER, IL1A, MYD88, and TLR5 were lower (q = 0.0002); while CXCL8 and S100P were higher (q = 0.0002) in tumor epithelia. Higher tumor expression of IL1A (HRadj = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49-0.94), IL6 (HRadj = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52-0.94), MyD88 (HRadj = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30-0.93), and TLR5 (HRadj = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.98) was associated with higher mortality risk. There was a synergistic effect on lower five-year survival in lower co-expressers of IL-6 and MyD88 (P < 0.0001). Our findings suggest that a TLRs/MyD88-mediated inflammatory response may play a role in CRC prognosis. The role of pattern recognition receptor-mediated immunity in CRC mortality warrants further research.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kathryn E.

a59af5439017957d2e6053274817dd010eafc745,Stability based testing for the analysis of fMRI data,"Neurological imaging has become increasingly important in the field of psychological research. The leading technique is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in which a correlate of the oxygen-level in the blood is measured (the BOLD-signal). In an fMRI-experiment, a time series of brain images is taken while participants perform a certain task. By comparing different conditions, the task-related areas in the brain can be localised. An fMRI study leads to enormous amounts of data. To analyse the data adequately, the brain images are devided into a large number of volume units (or voxels). Subsequently, a time series of the measured signal is modelled voxelwise as a linear combination of different signal components, after which an indication of activation can be tested in each voxel. This encompasses an enormous number of simultaneous statistical tests (+/-250 000 voxels). As a result, the multiple testing problem is a serious challenge for the analysis of fMRI data. In this context, classical multiple testing procedures such as Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) have been applied to respectively control the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate FDR)(Genovese, Lazar, & Nichols, 2002). Random Field Theory (Worsley, Evans, Marrett, & Neelin, 1992) controls the FWER while accounting for the spatial character of the data. Because of the dramatically decrease in power when controlling the FWER, methods to control the topological false discovery rate (FDR) were developed (Chumbley & Friston, 2009; Heller, Stanley, Yekutieli, Rubin, & Benjamini, 2006). A general shortcoming of current procedures is the focus on detecting non-null activation while a non-null effect is not necessarily biologically relevant. Moreover, failing to reject the hypothesis of no activation is not the same as conï¬dently excluding important effects. Another aspect that remains largely unexplored is the stability of test results which can be deï¬ned as selection variability of individual voxels (Qiu, Xiao, Gordon, & Yakovlev, 2006). Given the need to control both false positives (type I errors) and false negatives (type II errors) in a direct manner (Lieberman & Cunningham, 2009), we approach the multiple testing problem from a different angle. Following the procedure of (Gordon, Chen, Glazko, & Yakovlev, 2009) in the context of gene selection, we present a statistical method to detect brain activation that not only includes information on false positives, but also on power and stability. The method uses bootstrap resampling to extract information on stability and uses this information to detect the most reliable voxels in relation to the experiment. The ï¬ndings indicate that the method can improve stability of procedures and allows a direct trade-off between type I and type II errors. In this particular setting, it is shown how the proposed method enables researchers to adapt classical procedures while improving their stability. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulation studies and a real data example.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joke Durnez"", ids = ""46944603""); list(name = ""B.

Independent associations of increased term-corrected age LV myocardial wall thickness were (false discovery rate <0.05): degree of prematurity, antenatal glucocorticoid administration, and requirement for >48â€‰h postnatal respiratory support.PCA of LV geometry showed statistical differences between all preterm infants at term-corrected age and term controls.ConclusionsComputational CMR demonstrates that significant LV remodeling occurs soon after preterm delivery and is associated with definable clinical situations.

ed0ea2bd50ee7197d898b8f85c15ebce60bc40cf,Identification of gene expression patterns using planned linear contrasts,"BackgroundIn gene networks, the timing of significant changes in the expression level of each gene may be the most critical information in time course expression profiles. With the same timing of the initial change, genes which share similar patterns of expression for any number of sampling intervals from the beginning should be considered co-expressed at certain level(s) in the gene networks. In addition, multiple testing problems are complicated in experiments with multi-level treatments when thousands of genes are involved.ResultsTo address these issues, we first performed an ANOVA F test to identify significantly regulated genes. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% was applied to the P values of the F test. We then categorized the genes with a significant F test into 4 classes based on the timing of their initial responses by sequentially testing a complete set of orthogonal contrasts, the reverse Helmert series. For genes within each class, specific sequences of contrasts were performed to characterize their general 'fluctuation' shapes of expression along the subsequent sampling time points. To be consistent with the BH procedure, each contrast was examined using a stepwise Studentized Maximum Modulus test to control the gene based maximum family-wise error rate (MFWER) at the level of Î±newdetermined by the BH procedure. We demonstrated our method on the analysis of microarray data from murine olfactory sensory epithelia at five different time points after target ablation.ConclusionIn this manuscript, we used planned linear contrasts to analyze time-course microarray experiments. This analysis allowed us to characterize gene expression patterns based on the temporal order in the data, the timing of a gene's initial response, and the general shapes of gene expression patterns along the subsequent sampling time points. Our method is particularly suitable for analysis of microarray experiments in which it is often difficult to take sufficiently frequent measurements and/or the sampling intervals are non-uniform.",2005,Computer Science; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hao Li"", ids = ""1706574""); list(name = ""Constance L.

21b291a58cf308442c7e441cb2d0b6e4ac20ff59,SPECtre: a spectral coherence-based classifier of actively translated transcripts from ribosome profiling sequence data,"Summary: Active protein translation can be assessed and measured using ribosome profiling sequencing strategies. Existing analytical approaches applied to this technology make use of sequence fragment length or frame occupancy to differentiate between active translation and background noise, however they do not consider additional characteristics inherent to the technology which limits their overall accuracy. Here, we present an analytical tool that models the overall tri-nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence. Our software, SPECtre, examines the relationship of normalized ribosome profiling read coverage over a rolling series of windows along a transcript against an idealized reference signal. A comparison of SPECtre against current methods on existing and new data shows a marked improvement in accuracy for detecting active translation and exhibits overall high sensitivity at a low false discovery rate.

6b745a6c8336b1a813d93434b72cbfac45937936,A mutual information-based metric for evaluation of fMRI data-processing approaches.,"We propose a novel approach for evaluating the performance of activation detection in real (experimental) datasets using a new mutual information (MI)-based metric and compare its sensitivity to several existing performance metrics in both simulated and real datasets. The proposed approach is based on measuring the approximate MI between the fMRI time-series of a validation dataset and a calculated activation map (thresholded label map or continuous map) from an independent training dataset. The MI metric is used to measure the amount of information preserved during the extraction of an activation map from experimentally related fMRI time-series. The processing method that preserves maximal information between the maps and related time-series is proposed to be superior. The results on simulation datasets for multiple analysis models are consistent with the results of ROC curves, but are shown to have lower information content than for real datasets, limiting their generalizability. In real datasets for group analyses using the general linear model (GLM; FSL4 and SPM5), we show that MI values are (1) larger for groups of 15 versus 10 subjects and (2) more sensitive measures than reproducibility (for continuous maps) or Jaccard overlap metrics (for thresholded maps). We also show that (1) for an increasing fraction of nominally active voxels, both MI and false discovery rate (FDR) increase, and (2) at a fixed FDR, GLM using FSL4 tends to extract more voxels and more information than SPM5 using the default processing techniques in each package.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Babak Afshin-Pour"", ids = ""7594114""); list(name = ""Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh"", ids = ""70862444""); list(name = ""Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh"", ids = ""31250105""); list(name = ""Cheryl L.

21a9e5894a75cc89df214908f05d0f97466cbfc7,A targeted genotyping approach to enhance the identification of variants for lactation persistency in dairy cows.,"Lactation persistency (LP), defined as the ability of a cow to maintain milk production at a high level after milk peak, is an important phenotype for the dairy industry. In this study, we used a targeted genotyping approach to scan for potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 57 potential candidate genes derived from our previous genome wide association study on LP and from the literature. A total of 175,490 SNPs were annotated within 10-kb flanking regions of the selected candidate genes. After applying several filtering steps, a total of 105 SNPs were retained for genotyping using target genotyping arrays. SNP association analyses were performed in 1,231 Holstein cows with 69 polymorphic SNPs using the univariate liner mixed model with polygenic effects using DMU package. Six SNPs including rs43770847, rs208794152, and rs208332214 in ADRM1; rs209443540 in C5orf34; rs378943586 in DDX11; and rs385640152 in GHR were suggestively significantly associated with LP based on additive effects and associations with 4 of them (rs43770847, rs208794152, rs208332214, and rs209443540) were based on dominance effects at P < 0.05. However, none of the associations remained significant at false discovery rate adjusted P (FDR) < 0.05. The additive variances explained by each suggestively significantly associated SNP ranged from 0.15% (rs43770847 in ADRM1) to 5.69% (rs209443540 in C5orf34), suggesting that these SNPs might be used in genetic selection for enhanced LP. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by dominance effect ranged from 0.24% to 1.35% which suggests that genetic selection for enhanced LP might be more efficient by inclusion of dominance effects. Overall, this study identified several potentially functional variants that might be useful for selection programs for higher LP. Finally, a combination of identification of potentially functional variants followed by targeted genotyping and association analysis is a cost-effective approach for increasing the power of genetic association studies.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Duy Ngoc Do"", ids = ""38501386""); list(name = ""Nathalie Bissonnette"", ids = ""6500100""); list(name = ""P.

e60d8531180f578a1ecbc184ddc2664eede50cae,No Association of nineteen COX-2 gene variants to preclinical markers of atherosclerosis The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study,"Backgroud: The role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) single nucleotide polymorphisms has mostly been studied in relation to advanced atherosclerosis, but little is known how they contribute to preclinical disease. In the present study we analyzed whether COX-2 gene variants associate independently with the early subclinical markers of atherosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness and carotid artery distensibility in a population of young healthy Caucasian adults. Methods: SNPs for association analysis were collected from the COX-2 gene and 5 kb upand downstream of it. There were 19 SNPs available for analysis, four genotyped and fifteen imputed. Genotype data was available for 2442 individuals participating in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Genotype imputation was performed using MACH 1.0 and HapMap II CEU (release 22) samples as reference. Association analysis was performed using linear regression with an additive model. PLINK was used for true genotyped SNPs and ProbABEL for imputed genotype dosages. False discovery rate was used to take into account multiple testing bias. Results: Two of the COX-2 variants (rs689470, rs689462) associated with distensibility (p = 0.005) under the linear regression additive model. After adjustment with gender, age, body mass index and smoking status, association between these SNPs and distensibility remained significant (p = 0.031). Subjects carrying the minor alleles had higher value of carotid artery distensibility compared to the major allele homozygotes. However, after correcting p-values for multiple testing bias using false discovery rate, association was lost. Another COX-2 variant rs4648261 associated with mean carotid intima-media thickness (p = 0.046) and maximal carotid intima-media thickness (p = 0.048) in the linear regression model. Subjects carrying the minor allele of rs4648261 had lower values of mean and maximal carotid intima-media thickness compared to subjects homozygote for major allele. After adjustments the associations were lost with both mean and maximal carotid intima-media thickness. Thus, no statistically significant associations of the studied COX-2 variants with carotid artery distensibility or carotid intima-media thickness were found. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in a Finnish population, there are no significant associations between COX-2 variants and early atherosclerotic changes in young adulthood. * Correspondence: seppo.nikkari@uta.fi Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Tampere Medical School, Tampere, Finland Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Â© 2012 LÃ¤hteelÃ¤ et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

LÃ¤hteelÃ¤ et al. BMC Medical Genetics 2012, 13:32 Page 2 of 6 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/13/32 Background Atherosclerosis is the main pathologic process underlying cardiovascular disease. The chronic inflammatory reaction in vessel wall has an important role in disease initiation and progression [1]. Inflammation is partly regulated by prostaglandins which are produced through the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the rate-limiting steps in prostaglandin production from arachidonic acid. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most human tissues under basal conditions. COX-2 expression is primarily induced in response to inflammatory stimuli by growth factors, mitogens, and cytokines [2]. The important role of COX-1 expression in platelets leading to atherothrombosis has been clarified through its inhibition with acetosalicylic acid. However, the role of COX-2 activity in these events is still unclear [3]. COX-2 expression has been detected in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and macrophages within human atherosclerotic lesions [4,5]. Prostaglandins produced by the COX-2 route may have impact on the development of atherosclerosis by influencing inflammatory reaction, platelet function, leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration [6]. The role of COX-2 has previously been studied in relation to advanced atherosclerosis with clinical complications, such as coronary artery disease [7,8] myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke [9]. However, atherosclerosis begins in childhood and progresses for decades until clinical complications such as myocardial infarction appear [10]. Contributions of genetic alterations would be expected to manifest themselves in younger rather than in older subjects. In fact, it has been suggested that low COX-2 level may enhance foam cell production and consequently, increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [11]. Functional studies have been made for only two of the tested SNPs (rs 20417, rs 5275), but this does not necessarily mean that the others are not functional [12-14]. There are 302 known SNPs in the COX-2 gene available from the NCBI dbSNP human database. In the present study we analyzed all the 19 COX-2 SNPs available from the HapMap II CEU (release 22) and their association with subclinical markers of carotid atherosclerosis, such as carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and carotid artery distensibility (Cdist).",2012,,"list(name = ""Kati H LÃ¤hteelÃ¤"", ids = ""5192452""); list(name = ""Tarja A.

0b55f39c7ca0dfbfedf1da774f9eb9c96bdaca88,goCluster integrates statistical analysis and functional interpretation of microarray expression data,"MOTIVATION
Several tools that facilitate the interpretation of transcriptional profiles using gene annotation data are available but most of them combine a particular statistical analysis strategy with functional information. goCluster extends this concept by providing a modular framework that facilitates integration of statistical and functional microarray data analysis with data interpretation.


RESULTS
goCluster enables scientists to employ annotation information, clustering algorithms and visualization tools in their array data analysis and interpretation strategy. The package provides four clustering algorithms and GeneOntology terms as prototype annotation data. The functional analysis is based on the hypergeometric distribution whereby the Bonferroni correction or the false discovery rate can be used to correct for multiple testing. The approach implemented in goCluster was successfully applied to interpret the results of complex mammalian and yeast expression data obtained with high density oligonucleotide microarrays (GeneChips).

992c9c41031f82f291f88ec9a7cc33aec03283cc,Large-scale phosphoproteomeanalysis of human liver tissuebyenrichmentand fractionationofphosphopeptides with strong anion exchange chromatography,"The mixture of phosphopeptides enriched from proteome samples are very complex. To reduce the complexity it is necessary to fractionate the phosphopeptides. However, conventional enrichment methods typically only enrich phosphopeptides but not fractionate phosphopeptides. In this study, the application of strong anion exchange (SAX) chromatography for enrichment and fractionation of phosphopeptides was presented. It was found that phosphopeptides were highly enriched by SAX and majority of unmodified peptides did not bind onto SAX. Compared with Fe immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC), almost double phosphopeptides were identified from the same sample when only one fraction was generated by SAX. SAX and Fe-IMAC showed the complementarity in enrichment and identification of phosphopeptides. It was also demonstrated that SAX have the ability to fractionate phosphopeptides under gradient elution based on their different interaction with SAX adsorbent. SAX was further applied to enrich and fractionate phosphopeptides in tryptic digest of proteins extracted from human liver tissue adjacent to tumorous region for phosphoproteome profiling. This resulted in the highly confident identification of 274 phosphorylation sites from 305 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 168 proteins at false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.96%.

42603f7565bcdec5c4b87e33723f175e284506dd,Functional genomic analysis of peripheral blood during early acute renal allograft rejection.,"BACKGROUND
Acute graft rejection is an important clinical problem in renal transplantation and an adverse predictor for long-term graft survival. Peripheral blood biomarkers that provide evidence of early graft rejection may offer an important option for posttransplant monitoring, optimize the utility of graft biopsy, and permit timely and effective therapeutic intervention to minimize the graft damage.


METHODS
In this feasibility study (n=58), we have used gene expression profiling in a case-control design to compare whole blood samples between normal subjects (n=20) and patients with (n=11) or without (n=22) biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) or borderline changes (n=5).


RESULTS
A total of 183 probe sets representing 160 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.01) between subjects with or without BCAR, from which linear discriminant analysis and cross-validation identified an initial gene signature of 24 probe sets, and a more refined set of 11 probe sets found to classify subject samples correctly. Cross-validation suggested an out-of-sample sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 91% for identification of samples with or without BCAR. An increase in classifier gene expression correlated closely with acute rejection during the first 3 months posttransplant. Biological evaluation indicated that the differentially expressed genes encompassed processes related to immune response, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal reorganization.


CONCLUSION
Preliminary evidence indicates that gene expression in the peripheral blood may yield a relevant measure for the occurrence of BCAR and offer a potential tool for immunologic monitoring.

99edd69d6af87d44967c455db90d409b58ec485a,An epigenome-wide study of body mass index and DNA methylation in blood using participants from the Sister Study cohort,"Background/Objectives:The relationship between obesity and chronic disease risk is well-established; the underlying biological mechanisms driving this risk increase may include obesity-related epigenetic modifications. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and body mass index (BMI) using data from a subset of women in the Sister Study.Subjects/Methods:The Sister Study is a cohort of 50â€‰884 US women who had a sister with breast cancer but were free of breast cancer themselves at enrollment. Study participants completed examinations which included measurements of height and weight, and provided blood samples. Blood DNA methylation data generated with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip array covering 27,589 CpG sites was available for 871 women from a prior study of breast cancer and DNA methylation. To identify differentially methylated CpG sites associated with BMI, we analyzed this methylation data using robust linear regression with adjustment for age and case status. For those CpGs passing the false discovery rate significance level, we examined the association in a replication set comprised of a non-overlapping group of 187 women from the Sister Study who had DNA methylation data generated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Analysis of this expanded 450â€‰K array identified additional BMI-associated sites which were investigated with targeted pyrosequencing.Results:Four CpG sites reached genome-wide significance (false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05) in the discovery set and associations for all four were significant at strict Bonferroni correction in the replication set. An additional 23 sites passed FDR in the replication set and five were replicated by pyrosequencing in the discovery set. Several of the genes identified including ANGPT4, RORC, SOCS3, FSD2, XYLT1, ABCG1, STK39, ASB2 and CRHR2 have been linked to obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases.Conclusions:Our findings support the hypothesis that obesity-related epigenetic differences are detectable in blood and may be related to risk of chronic disease.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lauren E.

1898fcbf7fa36161f896c918a0d7eb82646f8b8b,Cross-study analysis of gene expression data for intermediate neuroblastoma identifies two biological subtypes,"BackgroundNeuroblastoma patients show heterogeneous clinical courses ranging from life-threatening progression to spontaneous regression. Recently, gene expression profiles of neuroblastoma tumours were associated with clinically different phenotypes. However, such data is still rare for important patient subgroups, such as patients with MYCN non-amplified advanced stage disease. Prediction of the individual course of disease and optimal therapy selection in this cohort is challenging. Additional research effort is needed to describe the patterns of gene expression in this cohort and to identify reliable prognostic markers for this subset of patients.MethodsWe combined gene expression data from two studies in a meta-analysis in order to investigate differences in gene expression of advanced stage (3 or 4) tumours without MYCN amplification that show contrasting outcomes (alive or dead) at five years after initial diagnosis. In addition, a predictive model for outcome was generated. Gene expression profiles from 66 patients were included from two studies using different microarray platforms.ResultsIn the combined data set, 72 genes were identified as differentially expressed by meta-analysis at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 8.33%. Meta-analysis detected 34 differentially expressed genes that were not found as significant in either single study. Outcome prediction based on data of both studies resulted in a predictive accuracy of 77%. Moreover, the genes that were differentially expressed in subgroups of advanced stage patients without MYCN amplification accurately separated MYCN amplified tumours from low stage tumours without MYCN amplification.ConclusionOur findings support the hypothesis that neuroblastoma consists of two biologically distinct subgroups that differ by characteristic gene expression patterns, which are associated with divergent clinical outcome.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Patrick Warnat"", ids = ""3033183""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© Oberthuer"", ids = ""4876513""); list(name = ""Matthias Fischer"", ids = ""50359340""); list(name = ""Frank Westermann"", ids = ""2427119""); list(name = ""Roland Eils"", ids = ""1805740""); list(name = ""Benedikt Brors"", ids = ""21850007"")",b70ec1dec8610a3f0e8b535895e072c4fb69036e; 1b7327ae59742b779f0851a325fba13e141a35b8; 9a72c7e26f874a774100fb167f9ec57faf34c044; 6048be8bffcd4e61d8863b523fa235decf15b951; 8690065ef0917a37d3063c315a920fc888224826; 5e2eab6da2be1440dcc1c4f6540491f934583c6e; 63e92c6910fd74ab5f3ebf6c493c51867e15293e; 0c462e418f0aaa55afb1475431c4c090e2dd07f7; c6a8013484b3cdce2ae1fb5bfec55b5f92ce13d1; e806610ad87837211436dd8e66851314ab422e6e; bc88dc78c2c9bca6c052c24eeb637813b33752e9; adb0aac0845db8e98c61b9c5aaa7ba2207247d38; 53f30eee77ac832f9ccfe91982531c59e9c8000c; 2804a121f2ac4cb79c8768126d4ec86dd58263a6; 5deb2e6052f32e676d7a7759a4871b4d5e86f834; 1f586ac7d74dd610f4909fc73f9d01b83e477357; 4257509fbb1fcc8efe19ec9bc54736a36a6f7f68; be61e49174928ab4257deaac19a6a0705be62b3b; 867158649f3dfa49ee760cc7ad7bbdb49b895a9d; 3bf0d3c269abbbf0fd3638f352edfb966f814fe0; 443edb9b436a5f3d62eec1d6497cf28a4dc5ee56; 70877569df37a028cd7e3a7d7334be71ca3218ac; 4d48e2704a15494c2fac296d421196d0537afdd9,a5e82ee0621f35bc3c1123dfbba32bad9932ef4d; 0eb8252877a74a4725fba52ae3b39c5040e946ae; 42c138e06a20bff640d4f6b8ba098a9086cebfc3; 43d868a5f8edeeb61d88601deaf0f73d75e1e193; 9c07c51fffda2a237fd9f7c4c0b2bb3f63f9b255; 6c2a3113e2bdff44b8d152a3689d63c94014b33e; 14598b8aba53ed1efe72136360a378b97fb95a3a; f4f2d895f5994b401d156ac18ccdd1139649e9aa; 0eaa28aa3612057f8af7c93c59e03f26e3f67ca8; ff1b53a11b95c5b69ca87aa1c7c0645324beffa4; 27ea14b9613b66a95b62b20134a82777e37cd476; 9a66b78916f3410861adb7466d49419001551411; 5a7eee92b4ea08e89cc89f2fcdba793a60e4c47d; 7c123849fdd8a7d679310f0795585cc45d683d1c; a7a3046291d81a340a988775df671effb835ad93; 48eb884166e0229c9bed73285bb068fc0002550e; 881060e011a1bfd74fe587f2d62c0b802c506e94; 99996dd91627950c78069ca5bee9a95c723d8028; 2d03f13272d0b57b7395edd3861a6d759f85f0f6; eb960b5d56ed1368991eaa4f40cb7afee66edb1f; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; a9c73cbcb9e4e8d080f2304357f92b417aa32d11; b802b297e40848652e9d3bf80b34d24fea1698bb; 926ed9636268908a4d9dcd69cb1cc1154e715a2a; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; dc9a97dc6c2fb5db47b5caf2e6b1466a95e77497; baf3877accd5854341a4b6696196ad8449679b45; 99015cffdecaa58600198d44029565851fcc1b7f; 74d20f6e686e3fbc06ec57e2e47257b70e394d3a,BMC Cancer,7,89 - 89

The goal is to keep the combined rate of false discoveries and non-discoveries as small as possible. A discrete approximation to a Polya tree prior that enjoys fast, conjugate updating, centered at the usual Gaussian distribution is proposed. This new technique and the advantages of this approach are demonstrated using extensive simulation and data analysis accompanied by a Java web application. The numerical studies demonstrate that this new procedure shows promising false discovery rate and estimation of key values in the mixture model with very reasonable computational speed.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""William Cipolli"", ids = ""3410328""); list(name = ""Timothy Hanson"", ids = ""144958981""); list(name = ""Alexander C.

4382f7ea8e46f91257b7de6beddc9a8d0eb9f4ff,PAPRIKA: Private Online False Discovery Rate Control,"In hypothesis testing, a false discovery occurs when a hypothesis is incorrectly rejected due to noise in the sample. When adaptively testing multiple hypotheses, the probability of a false discovery increases as more tests are performed. Thus the problem of False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is to find a procedure for testing multiple hypotheses that accounts for this effect in determining the set of hypotheses to reject. The goal is to minimize the number (or fraction) of false discoveries, while maintaining a high true positive rate (i.e., correct discoveries). 
In this work, we study False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple hypothesis testing under the constraint of differential privacy for the sample. Unlike previous work in this direction, we focus on the online setting, meaning that a decision about each hypothesis must be made immediately after the test is performed, rather than waiting for the output of all tests as in the offline setting. We provide new private algorithms based on state-of-the-art results in non-private online FDR control. Our algorithms have strong provable guarantees for privacy and statistical performance as measured by FDR and power. We also provide experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in a variety of data environments.",2020,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Wanrong Zhang"", ids = ""123247120""); list(name = ""Gautam Kamath"", ids = ""1969642""); list(name = ""Rachel Cummings"", ids = ""49326047"")",,38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 0023582fde36430c7e3ae81611a14e558c8f4bae; f46f16ec9ddb69dec6d594ccea38a51ea5e20312; be14c56689603b297e5429a8fe1ecee695cd77c7; 94168692edb14b8b15f16ec0d793d22d3137be48; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a7f5ddee3d55d628eae68653dc3b34ffcd2d2075; 6d30c134d4808ea49456baa62374a54e33dc8f9c; 5bd910767e2960bdeafbcff31b8c672ae5753039; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; 83b60b919278bbf72a79cff23dce953a9d5b0110; 2b7892e85fe08f0ad97f41512378011a3d21f659; e4ce10063cd25447dcde75c2d9ce327446ced952,ArXiv,abs/2002.12321,

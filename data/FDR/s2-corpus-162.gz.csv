56f4a919f9297ceaea4fca3d9288fef473af22e2,Random forest Granger causality for detection of effective brain connectivity using high-dimensional data.,"Studies have shown that the brain functions are not localized to isolated areas and connections but rather depend on the intricate network of connections and regions inside the brain. These networks are commonly analyzed using Granger causality (GC) that utilizes the ordinary least squares (OLS) method for its standard implementation. In the past, several approaches have shown to solve the limitations of OLS by using diverse regularization systems. However, there are still some shortcomings in terms of accuracy, precision, and false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper, we are proposing a new strategy to use Random Forest as a regularization technique for computing GC that will improve these shortcomings. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by comparing the results with existing Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Elastic-Net regularized implementations of GC using simulated dataset. Later, we have used our proposed approach to map the network involved during deductive reasoning using real StarPlus dataset.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohammad Shaheryar Furqan"", ids = ""40596311""); list(name = ""Mohammad Yakoob Siyal"", ids = ""34889548"")",c1fff5c789cb0c7705ef4531ce4f3aa09045abf9; 21ae3654a7ffed115be3dbdc9befd0bbf2f3efc5; a9d070ecd0c72ea7d76142b938928bb5d2d399d7; 045354b6e92cb526c1644a20ec61d28a9847a94f; 7b7f4de2e026d0f55c5372897ac672f6960722f3; d849949428a3e7f007e239b939ffcb030e094215; da880d4fd0de4504c216045c8f22925c28a26c30; 1b37f3270cdc61cd325ced57f0d5080bf89b5dbc,,Journal of integrative neuroscience,15 1,"

Aberrant DNA methylation is reported to have clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults. In this study, we performed a detailed genome-wide screening of DNA methylation to identify the epigenetic signatures that are associated with gene expression and prognosis in pediatric patients with AML.

Methods: Illumina 450K methylation microarray and Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarray profiles were obtained for 151 patients treated on the multicenter clinical trial AML02. For each gene, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed to summarize its methylation and expression signals into 1 expression score and 1 methylation score. We then used the statistical tool called projection onto the most interesting statistical evidence (PROMISE) to test whether the CCA expression and methylation scores were associated with a clinically meaningful pattern of in vitro resistance (IVR) to cytarabine, the presence of detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) after the first course of chemotherapy, and event-free survival (EFS). In the PROMISE analysis, low IVR, less MRD, and better EFS were defined as a beneficial pattern and the converse was defined as a detrimental pattern for patients. To address multiplicity, we computed the false discovery rate (FDR) for the results obtained from statistical analysis.

Results: The DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3B , which has been implicated in adult AML, was one of thirteen genes with the smallest possible permutation p-value in both CCA and PROMISE analyses. DNMT3B showed very statistically significant methylation-expression correlation (CCA r = -0.74, P = 7 Ã— 10-14, FDR = 9.7 Ã— 10-12). Also, DNMT3B showed very compelling evidence of a clinically meaningful pattern of association with IVR, MRD, and EFS (Figure 1; PROMISE P < 0.00001, FDR < 0.001). In particular, a higher CCA-defined methylation score was associated with lower IVR ( P = 0.14), less MRD ( P < 0.0001), and better EFS ( P = 0.00003). A higher CCA-defined expression score was associated with higher IVR ( P = 0.11), greater MRD ( P < 0.0001), and poorer EFS ( P = 0.00024). Further, the methylation of DNMT3B was strongly associated with each of the cytogenetic risk groups defined at diagnosis ( P = 9.7 Ã— 10-13) and the genome-wide methylation load (CCA r = 0.80, P < 1 Ã— 10-16).

Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that methylation of the DNMT3B locus modulates DNMT3B expression, thereby disrupting epigenetic regulation, altering the methylome, and influencing disease progression in and clinical prognosis of pediatric patients with AML. Our results provide evidence that adding demethylating agents to standard chemotherapy might improve the prognosis of pediatric patients with AML. Additional clinical and basic research is needed to further elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in the epigenetic modifications occurring in AML and to determine the optimal strategy to incorporate demethylating agents into the treatment for AML.

d5ea526df1f5817c11b82cc3a0942dc40681b65f,Shared neural activity in panic disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder compared with healthy controls.,"OBJECTIVE
In previous studies, some brain areas, including parahippocampal gyrus, were suggested to be associated with panic disorder. Both panic disorder and somatoform disorders are associated with anxiety. This study sought to determine if there are shared neural activity underlying panic disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder.


METHOD
Sixteen nonmedicated patients with panic disorder, 16 nonmedicated patients with undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and 10 healthy subjects were scanned between February 2005 and August 2006. Diagnoses were made according to the Korean version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Patient/Non-Patient Edition. Regional cerebral perfusion was measured by 99 m-Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Using statistical parametric mapping analysis, we compared the SPECT images between the groups.


RESULTS
Significant hyperperfusion was found at the left superior temporal gyrus and the left supramarginal gyrus in the panic disorder patients when compared to the controls (family-wise error [FWE], P < .001). The somatoform disorder patients showed hyperperfusion in the left hemisphere at the superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, middle occipital gyrus, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and, in the right hemisphere, at the superior temporal gyrus when compared to the controls (false discovery rate [FDR], P < .001). In contrast, significant hypoperfusion was found at the right parahippocampal gyrus in each of panic disorder (FWE, P = .001) and somatoform disorder (FWE, P < .001) groups compared to healthy controls. However, no significant differences were found in regional cerebral perfusion between the 2 disorder groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Both panic disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder showed hyperperfusion in the left superior temporal gyrus and hypoperfusion in the right parahippocampal gyrus, which suggests that the 2 disorders are likely to share neural activity.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyung Bong Koh"", ids = ""35586190""); list(name = ""Jee In Kang"", ids = ""4360024""); list(name = ""Jong Doo Lee"", ids = ""2891776""); list(name = ""Young-Joon Lee"", ids = ""144973224"")",90343e8939c8265ee24ee0e74236a343ac7d17af; 802a73401869ca3cc29db1c942a4d29a7b1eb0d3; 72b06978eb5d894778c2d532469602c7fff17a81; eb16954ad225b2b507c9796912ec9e89c33eb9df; 7699de4896a2166624592c488050b839a90b782b; fc77e6d84289f2013d09ed6fc12250c141b9e9e6; 94052cfcdff640bfa40e15880a29c98471da9d46; 02729ce80364561456e27a5cb4e9d0f991d8d1c1,,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,71 12,"

164ace7c29638d8f493d33deea03bfdf231cebf3,Simple estimators of false discovery rates given as few as one or two p-values without strong parametric assumptions,"Abstract Multiple comparison procedures that control a family-wise error rate or false discovery rate provide an achieved error rate as the adjusted p-value or q-value for each hypothesis tested. However, since achieved error rates are not understood as probabilities that the null hypotheses are true, empirical Bayes methods have been employed to estimate such posterior probabilities, called local false discovery rates (LFDRs) to emphasize that their priors are unknown and of the frequency type. The main approaches to LFDR estimation, relying either on fully parametric models to maximize likelihood or on the presence of enough hypotheses for nonparametric density estimation, lack the simplicity and generality of adjusted p-values. To begin filling the gap, this paper introduces simple methods of LFDR estimation with proven asymptotic conservatism without assuming the parameter distribution is in a parametric family. Simulations indicate that they remain conservative even for very small numbers of hypotheses. One of the proposed procedures enables interpreting the original FDR control rule in terms of LFDR estimation, thereby facilitating practical use of the former. The most conservative of the new procedures is applied to measured abundance levels of 20 proteins.",2013,Medicine; Mathematics; Biology,"list(name = ""David R.

717c027b6756c99e855413a8d585a6e1fa6ee5d7,Identification of novel gene signatures in patients with atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum.,"BACKGROUND
A subset of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is prone to disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (ie,Â atopic dermatitis with a history of eczema herpeticum [ADEH+]). Biomarkers that identify ADEH+ are lacking.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to search for novel ADEH+ gene signatures in PBMCs.


METHODS
An RNA-sequencing approach was applied to evaluate global transcriptional changes by using PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ and patients with atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-). Candidate genes were confirmed by means of quantitative PCR or ELISA.


RESULTS
PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ had distinct changes to the transcriptome when compared with those from patients with ADEH- after HSV-1 stimulation: 792 genes were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 (ANOVA), and 15 type I and type III interferon genes were among the top 20 most downregulated genes in patients with ADEH+. We further validated that IFN-Î± and IL-29 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in HSV-1-stimulated PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ compared with those from patients with ADEH- and healthy subjects. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis demonstrated that the upstream regulators of type I and type III interferons, interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, were significantly inhibited in patients with ADEH+ based on the downregulation of their target genes. Furthermore, we found that gene expression of IRF3 and IRF7 was significantly decreased in HSV-1-stimulated PBMCs from patients with ADEH+.


CONCLUSIONS
PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ have a distinct immune response after HSV-1 exposure compared with those from patients with ADEH-. Inhibition of the IRF3 and IRF7 innate immune pathways in patients with ADEH+ might be an important mechanism for increased susceptibility to disseminated viral infection.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lianghua Bin"", ids = ""35502468""); list(name = ""Michael G.

1ca20a49a125b649c833975174f4e3f99ed0c76f,Optimized multi-stage designs controlling the false discovery or the family-wise error rate.,"When a large number of hypotheses are investigated, we propose multi-stage designs where in each interim analysis promising hypotheses are screened, which are investigated in further stages. Given a fixed overall number of observations, this allows one to spend more observations for promising hypotheses than with single-stage designs, where the observations are equally distributed among all considered hypotheses. We propose multi-stage procedures controlling either the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) and derive asymptotically optimal stopping boundaries and sample size allocations (across stages) to maximize the power of the procedure. Optimized two-stage designs lead to a considerable increase in power compared with the classical single-stage design. Going from two to three stages additionally leads to a distinctive increase in power. Adding a fourth stage leads to a further improvement, which is, however, less pronounced. Surprisingly, we found only small differences in power between optimized integrated designs, where the data of all stages are used in the final test statistics, and optimized pilot designs where only the data from the final stage are used for testing. However, the integrated design controlling the FDR appeared to be more robust against misspecifications in the planning phase. Additionally, we found that with increasing number of stages the drop in power when controlling the FWER instead of the FDR becomes negligible. Our investigations show that the crucial point is not the choice of the error rate or the type of design, but the sequential nature of the trial where non-promising hypotheses are dropped in the early phases of the experiment.",2008,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sonja Zehetmayer"", ids = ""3167970""); list(name = ""Peter Bauer"", ids = ""145849144""); list(name = ""Martin Posch"", ids = ""2470495"")",ea1716f5e414f35ac4efb3837a41fbc4fd02d73b; 2522515d41aa2000e19487e26afe270fd090f4e1; e5c07cda574b61595308283c2e64e3eabc10f30e; 0c970bd78a7f4e1819cc53a90aac39140d20aa09; fa7dc2ffd04b7ab68960736bd1e81399bd1413c3; 37c21a0937505d63a844204050455948b84c8a6a; d3aaa88b68d299859a4a6a98b0c2df69b2b1f91d; de8f34d8d24e1c8a432c81927bcf7b301804fa11; 0400bec2d4ae5b265e235627c8a44b8787c7128f; d4e4284c78d1f8f34458050d90ab6b2b1edd8e09; 2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; b76ecf57c95524129701e19133c389711e46b77e; b255adb8dc1b25a8a4ec9dcd419ce8d2ca061ae4; dd540ea55a1f39644fa8d269988e5876a0538c5f; 63ab53da5b1a35c2e6d2a7e86eef0252e7348673; c0af0e87f110d7d8ef4cd7790eaef7364348013f; 161ec99aa6a09fcde5033eefdfd9d65660670731; 7670bcaad6933d39d15a560ccdfab881edb14053; 16d105562de35d01e3a9d2ba5baea04115c68b55; 7dd559fc7a2d83cb688107e64dc6e92afc2d42dc; c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f; 88e68a53958babc79e8ccea1346674727ee21d49,b26eb5cca8f7a72276be76dbc0e5d2f09ad0e94f; 3ea5160839adde27eab46b96b2ec41ed8305ddb6; e187ea180e5993197b08b5978ab6981388c572b1; 857f7b6708def88ab493029c65907641a914c55e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 866e0a0a45027c4b0cdd6a8443e559b0a712fb2b; 7a49e0976a42ea8cf8a8c0306e51d3c33924abfd; 7b06771ee8f39e516056df3365cd1cb679b5041f; b8f4d35dc8db4d76d046e69b7c46093dd51a1506; bcd1db6c7ebf8ba6a0bbba14764d42a741a4160a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 41581dd61fda814a96cb373a3cec52ef1bbac052; b2b16a9bf487b00f80801ff57c7cbb96503a9e81; c70d1123b8d398481f124950784506fc96f8549c; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 23f97aa433d131680de6dcb10833d6d257f2799c; 1156f895a3c2823ff757121b74a9afc5f9552ca8; 7e459946cb320935ee97eb9ffa23136524866257; aedf452469b3babc395a7d3071eee564eff7e4f5,Statistics in medicine,27 21,"

51a136885660243648355f8372598027ccefd1c5,Nodewise Knockoffs: False Discovery Rate Control for Gaussian Graphical Models,"Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) is important for obtaining reliable and reproducible conclusions in scientific research. This paper considers the problem of controlling the finite sample FDR in learning the structure of a Gaussian graphical model (GGM). Most state-of-the-art structure learning methods do not ensure the FDR control, and those that do are all based on p-values and multiple testing procedures. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a different angle by using the recently proposed knockoff idea of Barber and Candes. Our approach consists of two steps: (a) constructing knockoffs and feature statistics nodewisely; (b) applying a graph-wide rule in choosing the thresholds for each node and then recovering the structure of the graph. The finite sample FDR control property of this approach is shown. In addition, we use a sample-splitting-recycling procedure that first uses half of the sample to select hyperparameters, then learns the structure of the graph using all samples in a certain way such that the FDR control property still holds. Finally, we examine our methodology using simulations and a real data set.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jin-Zhou Li"", ids = ""49298034""); list(name = ""Marloes H.

36ec909708fc0e528b71886299323e5b6161be76,Association between oropharyngeal microbiome and weight gain in piglets during pre and post weaning life,"Birth weight and subsequent weight gain is of critical importance in the survival and performance of piglets on a commercial swine farm setting. Oropharyngeal microbiome could influence immunity, and feeding behavior thus impacting health and weight gain. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile the composition and predicted metabolic functionality of the oropharyngeal microbiota in 8 piglets (4 with a birthweight â‰¤ 1.0 kg and 4 with a birthweight â‰¥ 1.7 kg) at 11, 26, and 63 days of age. We found 9 genera that were significantly associated with average daily gain (ADG) at 11 days (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.05) and 26 days of age (FDR < 0.1), respectively. The microbial functional profile revealed several pathways associated with ADG (FDR < 0.05). Among these, pathways related to degradation of catechols showed a positive association with ADG at 11, 26, and 63 days of age, implying a potential to breakdown the host-derived catecholamines. We also noted that pathways related to the biodegradation of nucleosides and nucleotides increased with ADG during the pre-weaning phase, while those involved in their biosynthesis decreased. Our findings provide insights into the oropharyngeal microbial memberships and metabolic pathways that are involved in a piglet's weight gain. Thus, providing a basis for the development of strategies aimed at improving weight gain in pigs.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew Wange Bugenyi"", ids = ""117909013""); list(name = ""Ho-seong Cho"", ids = ""94487207""); list(name = ""Jaeyoung Heo"", ids = ""5205730"")",,8e3418f503c3ea8729826c7483c3b68b5726d193; 4f25138798cdce8dd2126353fd26ebc6e1893411; 133bcd7488a3c07cb0f493a87564c30e5433768c; 30a9644bdaac6f0ca78e8f0cd6b5a23d37a4d006; 5df5cce729b22ca99a6b7a17fb3de2a8b14f597f; 2fa6b500d68b48c0539486f3ba8e6a4f5111e273; bb39afc5fd72f9f5e80580e1dc7a1c097dfabcc1; e61d9be30ee0c309829b383797926398da563626; 7b33c9f7efd80087503c1d9af370847c32a2c79c; 9efd70d2c06733704220313fb67720aa45c6362a; 754800e628be84f13a9453994bdbd2eb02787352; 977ab503c18779cc4f0003c922b65c3f26facdf7; 3bcaf7a98425c803dc3b0c8999c6e085ffa25f1e; 1fafe7f3ccbb2933b7456d89baa19939aeaf9698; 97cc4b7d27ed15039b7f9df738c8cef007bcbc16; 89e5f4b13082c2df47e079c69839a3a459d23d15; 6405af1520af1d3a7856e77c8d57dee20d996b54; 3513246b541887e8a1df6fb39a2d54e2a918abec; 7624b4b863ddf62f56bdf8db22f25ead943f70d9; f5091c8827e3a2e5c2ef30b994371cbc881bc8f0; 32a067ef27e72b5afc257bc9be4a1bed666d2696; 25c0fed90fb30fe980529b86975c1cc9f0569004; 9e9c7eea95d9d2cd61c2f6559009175549cf46f0; 08789c0b569c4cfc0241c9bd3ac8707407ed9467; 6d12a1d23b21a9b170118a56386552bc5d4727de; 08dddb6285840f7568c6e4c073ab56ea2bd53332; 7071b85c83035ff86c8ed3c1f3319a304bfb7fb5; 3d1017e9ba7835ee50ed4587248b3b9e0f7533bb; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; ca5bb07173efa7cce842099caa58fe65e98ae7f2; ca32a8874954779f1df4e635f2794c66af4c2f8f; 30f71a5296256b2448aca2ef120aede4f248d6e2; 06dd7c2ce0d7e4ec2cf15b0c695d681264ca80a0; f0727d9a34fa6e903fd1e65d5f3b6505cc1d1d8f; 080f62e9088d32484f70b431bd771cbcd329eeca; 3ad6cde88bdddc088b0a6fb6ee587171983d9fd8; d32587c0cc496449f44330defb5e49e098875071; 5703b69ef77eb10ad75ee9a6196a0d4130b8cc03; d5677974ad0a645fbb71a6dc0355c54005239882; 4da27cd0db58cf6d8525a06dd5def1584acb0de8; 7554e8993ca1da62f3d5a42fb88393895bc821cd; 3e56119cfd0feffdb022987cf6c7c5e828275bd8; 06aab3aeab6ca0d77f0cc91ad161697b5cab6702; 926219e38320f1a23f2157ea44d60ebb2f42c129; 4a1d4fa9d2f6f43cf5c546509fcb734416832f61; 08c3e1f827e1a68d957c05b3e0ab3d6de2f46215; 4cd6a0528e4502ce839ab595b537badcd8347082; ef23b051c7bc31470e93a19b26075580050ecf21; 905f2d1ddb9709d01e1427526c87c0fa1d0b5e95; 6d326f4955e83fa567c8c63775b987294cf95bf5; 3e077a38bc78c59021e97c595c4ee9f1ef75e634; b78b1ea5b70dc8657822a16eb16ba78d11a65cd6; 546a4da536369ef469da9cacb6a19026a72c3074; 63116ca22d65d15a178091ed5b20d89482d7b3db; 023a218771400f4e3d150609d81f9ecd7c38d85d; 85cb2afe177b9a25b3700ef03b6d8c200bf028e2; 5c3d76b9d0d6c8259485ee2040193593ae17abc0; d7e2b3d56b05a6adfdb7b2bd464a9af6360a2829; 0d89f1626998c4bbdba932787aabdc825ad49636,Journal of Animal Science and Technology,62,247 - 262
7f2798f3cdd1422f8d14e0123ff7fa8250638144,On the Performance of Variable Selection and Classification via Rank-Based Classifier,"In high-dimensional gene expression data analysis, the accuracy and reliability of cancer classification and selection of important genes play a very crucial role. To identify these important genes and predict future outcomes (tumor vs. non-tumor), various methods have been proposed in the literature. But only few of them take into account correlation patterns and grouping effects among the genes. In this article, we propose a rank-based modification of the popular penalized logistic regression procedure based on a combination of l 1 and l 2 penalties capable of handling possible correlation among genes in different groups. While the l 1 penalty maintains sparsity, the l 2 penalty induces smoothness based on the information from the Laplacian matrix, which represents the correlation pattern among genes. We combined logistic regression with the BH-FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate) screening procedure and a newly developed rank-based selection method to come up with an optimal model retaining the important genes. Through simulation studies and real-world application to high-dimensional colon cancer gene expression data, we demonstrated that the proposed rank-based method outperforms such currently popular methods as lasso, adaptive lasso and elastic net when applied both to gene selection and classification.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Showaib Rahman Sarker"", ids = ""148132914""); list(name = ""Michael Pokojovy"", ids = ""3057804""); list(name = ""SangJin Kim"", ids = ""39725401"")",,1e2e9e5c577d257cc6a7b6f219ef1d320d897c10; b716d4fcab2a0508781d532a0663438c3d43c308; 34d405eaecab40a932108a7ff97e92fb8fd1ae4e; 71ec99afe2ef68ac08e8c5e381573488f1da9b91; 418ca74964d4c9ceba96fe2d7183f62858bdada9; 2e427bd89132922a059336f63dc00fc7a78876c0; c4b21299f48e9c4384671a4d963167e5a79fd36b; 0d54f5f642a346aa678491e4739055124c0dc44a; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 24d1f4468a031c563a6c9c349c66383bcb7f30a4; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; b26bb53333d151dce65f0cfc85832470246e75c3; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 7e7f7181a70d7856cf54dd6641c2a60bbabbb39c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 931eeb2e10de67dfe0d364a066d03f5059b18cd9; 5c28b24b0ecb610c6a527b32c3acb2c03b1bc184; 87d663379ac8c493cc988c4ab45f7ad22f14ae3e; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; 5a12520cf26b8c78dff3b5e115678d83648b5866; 5bb4c0f83877dc2485ab99120bd4a94780a8a17b; d40ee5dd758c525dfb9932d726bb4e844b7b8478,,7,457
375ca4fec939352828f28ea9dc3dac29459ff538,25-Hydroxyvitamin D in pregnancy and genome wide cord blood DNA methylation in two pregnancy cohorts (MoBa and ALSPAC),"The aim of the study was to investigate whether maternal mid-pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with cord blood DNA methylation. DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured in 819 mothers/newborn pairs participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) and 597 mothers/newborn pairs participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Across 473,731CpG DNA methylation sites in cord blood DNA, none were strongly associated with maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D after adjusting for multiple tests (false discovery rate (FDR)>0.5; 473,731 tests). A meta-analysis of the results from both cohorts, using the Fisher method for combining p-values, also did not strengthen findings (FDR>0.2). Further exploration of a set of CpG sites in the proximity of four a priori defined candidate genes (CYP24A1, CYP27B1, CYP27A1 and CYP2R1) did not result in any associations with FDR<0.05 (56 tests). In this large genome wide assessment of the potential influence of maternal vitamin D status on DNA methylation, we did not find any convincing associations in 1416 newborns. If true associations do exist, their identification might require much larger consortium studies, expanded genomic coverage, investigation of alternative cell types or measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at different gestational time points.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""M.

The findings include an abundance of poor spectra, low-scoring peptide-spectrum matches and incorrectly identified proteins in both these studies, highlighting clear issues with the application of false discovery rates. This noise means that the claims made by the two papers - the identification of high numbers of protein coding genes, the detection of novel coding regions and the draft tissue maps themselves - should be treated with considerable caution. The authors recommend that clinicians and researchers do not use the unfiltered data from these studies. Despite this these studies will inspire further investigation into tissue-based proteomics.

The advantage of the FDR over existing methods is that it selects more outperforming rules which allows diversifying against model uncertainty. Persistence tests show that, even with the more powerful FDR technique, an investor would never have been able to select ex ante the future best-performing rules. Moreover, even in-sample, the performance is completely offset by the introduction of low transaction costs. Overall, our results seriously call into question the economic value of technical trading rules that has been reported for early periods.",2011,,"list(name = ""Pierre Bajgrowicz"", ids = ""3436484""); list(name = ""Olivier Scaillet"", ids = ""2482938"")",,ef2f806ed7a6a0196cfa4b57ffaea812ee948c4a; c128ef84b7839ab82fb88729f14a428e4b12f6d6; aa47c847f29103337d645dd782b81e4b931334e7; dff366b3fc4e3d4159eed6ed6bb178ea3cfe7346; c02a30679eb6fb10e6c42b2d9e7c96c2bd6b3a51; bd53ebf7e28d0ee4d6904be1875c5a931d5b28bf; 37906587dad13770392f474e423ea7f9d275ba53; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f8a288f2e23a9cab2a71323516475c42c21981d2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b635c166b509b7dfd1ccd92561c863ba1d69af1a; 23b250895f5823b4842638ee2fac124d9a406331; 6de9b888ac2a643692ae5f7f74662bd5b2369371; 95242e5c49527fdc2f7ae2467612c796a9baf9a1; ea604e035bfecc7c9260b191fd65a6aad13abbb9; a2082c1f0c07ce7cd84d378af601e967d2132514; fd79b83fedb087030b2e770ba27031193062547f; c9b04237cd9d2003242b94d6ccd0d9619ae0560d; daacb65ca06be657f0333aeb5da7f31417e03d6a; ee1014390904db3c2c7c1f81719f49450e621a70; eacb4e76c38ebc83f8da49745e5c571c304e0274; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 18277eb6ac9ced7857918b57403ebeaa89e55b2d; 46459ec2267cad618de8f74d824c2326815a0e48; 110d8a27b344315ac551c9a199c7e0c62c1b55bf; e366dd32b4b5790db34f710572964a161f72ec53; 44e7bfd8f264569de364c7a8c8b108c0103b3834; 4cf01507070ef68e7bbf5c9421b21d4ede10feac; ba369782f33e7137adf952a61a0fa7b884dec032; c5ef09c02e207b3194897bb2cd9d1e17ed897d2d; 733c60263ee6d42e03b19801345e02937ab874ba; 6ac4064925decc3c55d660bec8b13e4d118bb575; 2e518ed02b2ea53d8deebe62b9519ea2f712ad1c; a731fbbe1e0e2c0895aa833f3483b89adaac2302; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; e4cc7d185db927910f0ad0cae057c235b4bfbac9; 234fec270d2a9d7bf2922ac051d5216f966cf43c; e4ab1fbeeaebfc457fb16cd366cf4745feae5a9a; b083ec4a85dd600fb5f26d73f64d441366341567; 3883e64b7fc4ec6d859ec4b36a2875bc4182813a; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; 07610d8f9af7cfdffb3f0ab17ac25e9af5edee7d; b8b2d318f76b3340b02d572d9bfe1db9d0db3d50; e8427c6df1d6f51d78aaeee4606ce5bb494b878d; d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; c62d163110cbc7ae599462a2145b0143326c632d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 83d10adb98319ab3fcc15dfa44dd3f7ff80e4bda,,,
d8000c04e8bb71c90a8127caa119afa034c42c58,Kernel canonical correlation analysis for assessing geneâ€“gene interactions and application to ovarian cancer,"Although single-locus approaches have been widely applied to identify disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), complex diseases are thought to be the product of multiple interactions between loci. This has led to the recent development of statistical methods for detecting statistical interactions between two loci. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has previously been proposed to detect geneâ€“gene coassociation. However, this approach is limited to detecting linear relations and can only be applied when the number of observations exceeds the number of SNPs in a gene. This limitation is particularly important for next-generation sequencing, which could yield a large number of novel variants on a limited number of subjects. To overcome these limitations, we propose an approach to detect geneâ€“gene interactions on the basis of a kernelized version of CCA (KCCA). Our simulation studies showed that KCCA controls the Type-I error, and is more powerful than leading gene-based approaches under a disease model with negligible marginal effects. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we also applied KCCA to assess interactions between 200 genes in the NF-ÎºB pathway in relation to ovarian cancer risk in 3869 cases and 3276 controls. We identified 13 significant gene pairs relevant to ovarian cancer risk (local false discovery rate <0.05).

a3ecddcbbf17f0a1e4fddfef7fb3e8311351b3a0,Expression changes in mouse brains following nicotine-induced seizures: the modulation of transcription factor networks.,"Nicotine, acting through the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), can induce seizures in mice. We aimed to study brain transcriptional response to seizure and to identify genes whose expression is altered after nicotine-induced seizures. Whole brains of untreated mice were compared with brains 1 h after seizure activity, using Affymetrix U74Av2 microarrays. Experimental groups included wild-type mice and both nicotine-induced seizure-sensitive and -resistant nAChR mutant mice. Each genotype group received different nicotine doses to generate seizures. This approach allowed the identification of significantly changed genes whose expression was dependent on seizure activity, nicotine administration, or both but not on the type of nAChR subunit mutation or the amount of nicotine injected. Significant expression changes were detected in 62 genes (P < 0.05, false discovery rate correction). Among them, gene ontology functional annotation analysis determined that the most significantly overrepresented categories were of genes encoding MAP kinase phosphatases, regulators of transcription and nucleosome assembly proteins. In silico bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions of the 62 changed genes detected significant enrichments of 16 transcription regulatory elements (TREs), creating a network of transcriptional regulatory responses to seizures. The TREs for activating transcription factor and serum response factor were most significantly enriched, supporting their association with seizure activity. Our data suggest that nicotine-induced seizure in mice is a useful model to study seizure activity and its global brain transcriptional response. The differentially expressed genes detected here can help us to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying seizures in animal models and may also serve as candidate genes to study epilepsy in humans.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Merav Kedmi"", ids = ""5695834""); list(name = ""Avi Orr-Urtreger"", ids = ""88530209"")",b992d29653903cf708b9fd02f152e87b03c04a0e; bf63b4d9accd7c947f9e7247ec1d999ef8e8a106; 703d35bb3df46bae146af90c729d9d4506e25227; 04e18a5d3196ea9aeddd6a561541fa4d8e74410d; 5802a41dc1a7622e234019441d80c0d1c604aa91,d5475fecde271a95ca81ef15aed26fbe6ce815b3; a53e9aa2e88e06c8ddc9742586e7883ff69eaa5b; a6b4d0ba5bce80d053158c8fbfc6dc8b5d997f34; b598addca25521a61f46a4d1b0af3f6aab75b4a9; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 8f3ac2a7f13bed686d58aa21078d04a1ff253ef7; 919f061366967245228e40d48491c6be9735f31f; fd4ad104134e0337d59bcf575cc1c02b9fbb92cf; c651d79f9dea62cce22145535ebe90ab28094d90; 4219abcdde942ebac8193feb4d46b919df8c3ec9; 6e4d22f5a31fac24d82b93c997ba21b0dc227baa; deb9e38add5245706e3048f6f1a2308b52c3e927; 1e6680ccc9358ff0153feb39b7afc5f814797bb2; 7bde27e449d1d8960bad9d48720466f786a05b09; 01089a53a6a9c3aa08472ac2dbfdfb1931709d95; f7ff8e4585a0e9e5b64cb4748961078a8ae1e6e0; c83a0e53f67c4a295338a4b4e69e04cf0d03011f; e356141bc66b0eb607718648e0d9973bce1ea3b9; f610acd15f1594f629a8e2ad892a4ff244ef0524; c617e5ac601c5d2cc8f01c1b5aeb36ab8607de40; aeaa877d60cb0f7ce158378c063671ed2c0c70ce; fa02af7fb77eadf03e5588d2e044e1ffffa7f601; 5748cf14dfe004b413776a270611af8ba6211a34; d14f6967a1533ed7135a4e9d96c2ae45f73a16f9; e4bdc27ad1275cb6e58189588ea299c2e7b5d74c; 4834ecb1b9d4933f1c186a711368d62832e5c18f; 9956d8b073936cd697cf200d6edb7debb6f073ce; 7eb33a653677944dead6c631d4e10885ad7338d3; baf63fdb47a1c64b5561190ebde89bf77984377e; 4ed0635560fdd5c512086e5d3d1c50c08758da2b; 78c1fc2069a0d9604f2faa9472663618f593c7d8; 77130c2679622c95c6e4c60b2b83226b25d007fa; 231f8dd916abc4e21761827547183afd64a6a4ae; c7d20f649e4628703b2fe4fc06150ef6a26d9f0f; 65e09394877a7d346432a8ae15eece86a0df053a; 04f75ae6bec9a1ddd65a40a4eaa915c23143348d; 722efaf22459cf0f28cd258f622c69d7549d383d; ee024e1ae869011cece4da7638cdfe1ba4953e56; 30e5c0f3510e4f4967711c47fba55c482ff16883; 499a6ce6abe33f7659487f757d314f7eed528196; 0dd180087019a8e055e60c7d4e84d88265503704; f404d5d85964b61fe2295eb3c520f4eb13aa1435; 537630e19bb11f834dc8d8710688bc3b1a439c0a; f0461092a6246142f64aff8a5ddc9e228a8c4b19; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; fd014faad4434e38603eaa4e93be04673ba9e728; 2bd3fa75336451e239e0bbaf85b3f35ccc27c029; 17930ccf2f8b5d9d8715ded6d9a23294e70cce8d; 1425a3e89a3306f991a1cc334a272fea46681735; 29bb40921ba3bb6ebe434b634ebc0a054d3ba304; 4c637e399c5ab349a5e48ba5ef0822adca7e719b; f55e157a9f5d2aae154e20e4c597ef107f6612a9; cdd0168274f64184cd6952602643e2e5da56fae1; 33c182f322e569136a25e044eb0766e7a8e580a2; ec874bba94bc9e249047b3d060941640a7bb04b3; da2feea90ef70e48008f6d481e1d1c83d584c690; 1d523eb8bd37a1ca8ea2a62f90d7b03bbf854e58; 3a59aee2b7019a78a2921a1da24446dae1f376ac; 5f20d5dbe48bdaebe481bb0e5ad75e656f117013; add1c9777c9bd656b3c0bad1af08de29eaa8182b; ebd2a3ef294ed3ed9e645b53d00ded140bcc656a; 093fc348781b6bfdb60ae3b8b323c229ad91a102; 52cbb2c7fca49f123d908c8962f824f7386e23bc; ca13dc6586975d9ddf82aee4278527ff9cc94eb8; 05ad7fd28c1fc25fedb323c308a12b9757fa3a82; 2fff9183f92d98044b4d53c966987dcaed0dc564; 0961e1fb54603c01fd47b48e58ec99d5e4dd64ab; b3e1705716a12a2cea281dbd4bab6aa13b6d8b87; fe99b4916a25997dd0d9bbcc0fb316512a69d607; 7193893dc07a2fd67ab9a6c805afda7a13efa7bb; 8b0ad673bfbfebb52f24d0d97dd595a16d8883c0; ba54c688d684d52e98da2fa2a0864b3714c9a31a; 078ad3bf689d71b050d990755a2f2750b53bbbdc,Physiological genomics,30 3,"

We carried out a meta-analysis of the messenger RNA expression profiles from recipients of trivalent inactivated vaccines (TIV) or live attenuated vaccines (LAIV) to determine the different recipients' responses to these two types of vaccines, which may provide information to improve the design of future improved vaccines. We executed meta-analysis on these datasets using a random-effects model and identified 191 and 195 differentially expressed genes in TIV and LAIV, respectively, with an false discovery rate <0.05. The genes significantly upregulated by TIV were associated with both the innate immune response and the humoral immune response, whereas LAIV mainly activated the innate immune system.

Informed by previous research, the purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between sexual minority stress and leukocyte gene expression related to inflammation, cancer, immune function, and cardiovascular function. Sexual minority men living with HIV who were on anti-retroviral medication, had viral loadâ€¯<â€¯200 copies/mL, and had biologically confirmed, recent methamphetamine use completed minority stress measures and submitted blood samples for RNA sequencing on leukocytes. Differential gene expression and pathway analyses were conducted comparing those with clinically elevated minority stress (nâ€¯=â€¯18) and those who did not meet the clinical cutoff (nâ€¯=â€¯20), covarying reactive urine toxicology results for very recent stimulant use. In total, 90 differentially expressed genes and 138 gene set pathways evidencing 2-directional perturbation were observed at false discovery rate (FDR)â€¯<â€¯0.10. Of these, 41 of the differentially expressed genes and 35 of the 2-directionally perturbed pathways were identified as functionally related to hypothesized mechanisms of inflammation, cancer, immune function, and cardiovascular function. The neuroactive-ligand receptor pathway (implicated in cancer development) was identified using signaling pathway impact analysis.

37819dafa503613af0f6b81eaa1761898cc124b1,Segregation distortion: Utilizing simulated genotyping data to evaluate statistical methods,"Segregation distortion is the phenomenon in which genotypes deviate from expected Mendelian ratios in the progeny of a cross between two varieties or species. There is not currently a widely used consensus for the appropriate statistical test, or more specifically the multiple testing correction procedure, used to detect segregation distortion for high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. Here we examine the efficacy of various multiple testing procedures, including chi-square test with no correction for multiple testing, false-discovery rate correction and Bonferroni correction using an in-silico simulation of a biparental mapping population. We find that the false discovery rate correction best approximates the traditional p-value threshold of 0.05 for high-density marker data. We also utilize this simulation to test the effect of segregation distortion on the genetic mapping process, specifically on the formation of linkage groups during marker clustering. Only extreme segregation distortion was found to effect genetic mapping. In addition, we utilize replicate empirical mapping populations of wheat varieties Avalon and Cadenza to assess how often segregation distortion conforms to the same pattern between closely related wheat varieties.",2020,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander Coulton"", ids = ""1500459590""); list(name = ""Alexandra M.

36ba289e797e2b6bd74426b93d51cc824981f080,Discovery of meaningful associations in genomic data using partial correlation coefficients,"MOTIVATION
A major challenge of systems biology is to infer biochemical interactions from large-scale observations, such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We propose to use a partial correlation analysis to construct approximate Undirected Dependency Graphs from such large-scale biochemical data. This approach enables a distinction between direct and indirect interactions of biochemical compounds, thereby inferring the underlying network topology.


RESULTS
The method is first thoroughly evaluated with a large set of simulated data. Results indicate that the approach has good statistical power and a low False Discovery Rate even in the presence of noise in the data. We then applied the method to an existing data set of yeast gene expression. Several small gene networks were inferred and found to contain genes known to be collectively involved in particular biochemical processes. In some of these networks there are also uncharacterized ORFs present, which lead to hypotheses about their functions.

054c2b6172121628685137d632212f370934f53d,Baseline Racial Differences in ENABLE-CHF-PC Trial Participants,"Background 
While recent evidence demonstrates providing early palliative care (EPC) with routine heart failure (HF) care can improve quality of life (QOL) and reduce symptom burden and healthcare use, there is limited evidence examining EPC in a racially diverse HF population in the Southeastern US. Aims To describe and explore patient (PT) and caregiver (CG) participantsâ€™ baseline sociodemographics and outcome measures focusing on racial differences. Methods We compared sociodemographics and baseline PT/CG-reported outcome measures (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ], Hospital Anxiety/Depression Scale [HADS], religious coping style, & CG burden (Montgomery Borgatta Caregiver Burden [MCBC] Scale). We then calculated racial differences in these measures using T-tests adjusted with a False Discovery Rate. Results Of 487 participants, there were 357 PTs (nWhite(W)= 157; nBlack(B)= 200) and 130 CGs (nW= 55; nB= 75). Relative to race, Black PTs were younger (nW= 65.12; nB= 62.72; d= 0.29; p= 0.037), less likely to be married (nW= 90; nB= 78; d=0. 42, p= 0.0024), less likely to have private insurance coverage (nW= 103; nB= 83; d= 0.42, p= 0.0024), less likely to have a rural residence (nw= 55, nB= 39; d=0.35; p= 0.0086). Clinically, Black PTs had a lower ejection fraction (Mw= 44.99, MB= 38.9; d= 0.38, p= 0.0047) and fewer had a DNR order (nW= 37; nBâ€¯=â€¯22; d= 0.36, p= 0.0101). Black PTs also reported more negative religious coping (Mw= 3.8; MB=3.65; d=0.32, p= 0.473). Relative to race, more Black CGs were Protestant (nw= 48, nB= 74; d= 0.39). Black CGs reported lower HADS-depression scores (Mw= 5.36, MB= 4.15; d= 0.38) and lower CG burden scores (MBCB (Mw= 45.05; MB= 42.59; d= 0.43)). Conclusion There were relevant differences in RCT participantsâ€™ demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. It will be important to consider these differences in analyzing trial outcomes and in intervention impact. Ultimately, if racial differences are identified this presents opportunities for tailoring the cultural aspects of the intervention to improve both access to and acceptability of EPC in all HF populations.

8f3f239f62277a3d70130bda92e4810d2a458011,Gene Expression Reveals Two Distinct Biological Groups within T-Cell Prolymphocytic Leukaemia.,"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is rare and presents with widespread disease. Indolent presentations are seen but eventually progress. The disease shows marked chemoresistance and is best treated with the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody (CAMPATH). Prolymphocytes show a post-thymic phenotype and are CD4+CD8âˆ’ (65%), CD4âˆ’CD8+ (10%) or CD4+CD8+ (25%). This double positive phenotype, raises questions about the putative ontology of T-PLL. Morphological heterogeneity, with typical (75%), small cell (20%) and cerebriform/sezary-like variants (5%) is described. Inversions or reciprocal translocations of chromosome 14 involving breakpoints at q11 (TCR a/d) and q32.1 (TCL1 and TCL1b) are seen (~ 80%). Other common abnormalities involve chromosome 8, translocation (X;14)(q28;q11) and, ATM (11q23). We investigated the clinico-pathological heterogeneity in T-PLL, at the level of the transcriptome and evaluated the ability of gene expression profiling to sub-classify T-PLL. Total RNA was extracted from blood prolymphocytes (>92% purity) of 22 patients. cDNA synthesis followed by biotin-labelled cRNA synthesis was carried out as per Affymetrix protocols. Fragmented cRNA was hybridized to the Human U133 PLUS2 GeneChip array (54K probes). Microarray services were provided by MRC geneservice (UK HGMP Resource Centre). Hierarchical clustering of samples was performed using a filtered gene set (12,456) and >4 different algorithims. Prediction analysis for micoarray (PAM) and significance analysis of microarray (SAM) were used to evaluate class performance, and partition genes using pre-defined labels of immunophenotype, karyotype, response and morphology. Validation was performed by RT-PCR in a subset of genes.Unsupervised analysis robustly and reproducibly partitioned samples into 2 groups; A (n=8) and B (n=14). SAM analysis identified 4487 differentially expressed transcripts (false discovery rates 40% of which showed >2-fold difference in expression between the groups. There was no statistical difference in age, immunophenotype or karyotype betweeen groups, however, differential response to CAMPATH was seen. PAM analysis refined a sub-group of ~123 genes which most efficiently differentiated these groups. Group A showed significantly higher rates of non-response and progressive disease as compared to group B (n=14, p=0.036). Key differences related to apoptosis and cell-cycle associated gene expression. Down regulation of caspases (CASP1, CASP2,CASP4, CARD8 and CASP8AP2), cyclins (CCNC, CCND2, CCND3, CCNG1, CCNI, CCNT2), bcl-2, HDAC1, HIPK2, IL6R and ATM were frequent in group A with upregulation of genes implicated in NF-kB (TRAF4, SQSTM1) and TNF pathways (LMNA, ARTS-1), as well as transcription factors such as ATF-3. CD52 expression was ~2-fold higher in group B and may explain in part, differential responses to CAMPATH. RT-PCR validated gene expression data for LMNA and ATF-3. Despite the small numbers, algorithim-independent segregation into 2 consistent groups, in conjunction with the magnitude of gene differences, presence of many mutually exclusive divisions, and low prediciton errors, imply that the 2 identified profiles arise from fundamental differences at a regulatory level and thus likely represent a generalisable classification for T-PLL. Differential responses to CAMPATH may be a sub-feature of this grouping.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Nnenna Osuji"", ids = ""7914644""); list(name = ""Ilaria Del Giudice"", ids = ""6569415""); list(name = ""Tim J.

8c471432d5a7926bdab78d15ceee0378442ef988,Synaptic protein ubiquitination in rat brain revealed by antibody-based ubiquitome analysis.,"Protein ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification regulating neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and its dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Here we report a systematic analysis of ubiquitinated proteome (ubiquitome) in rat brain using a newly developed monoclonal antibody that recognizes the diglycine tag on lysine residues in trypsinized peptides (K-GG peptides). Initial antibody specificity analysis showed that the antibody can distinguish K-GG peptides from linear GG peptides or pseudo K-GG peptides derived from iodoacetamide. To evaluate the false discovery rate of K-GG peptide matches during database search, we introduced a null experiment using bacterial lysate that contains no such peptides. The brain ubiquitome was then analyzed by this antibody enrichment with or without strong cation exchange (SCX) prefractionation. During SCX chromatography, although the vast majority of K-GG peptides were detected in the fractions containing at least three positive charged peptides, specific K-GG peptides with two positive charges (e.g., protein N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal non-K/R peptides) were also identified in early fractions. The reliability of C-terminal K-GG peptides was also extensively investigated. Finally, we collected a data set of 1786 K-GG sites on 2064 peptides in 921 proteins and estimated their abundance by spectral counting. The study reveals a wide range of ubiquitination events on key components in presynaptic region (e.g., Bassoon, NSF, SNAP25, synapsin, synaptotagmin, and syntaxin) and postsynaptic density (e.g., PSD-95, GKAP, CaMKII, as well as receptors for NMDA, AMPA, GABA, serotonin, and acetylcholine). We also determined ubiquitination sites on amyloid precursor protein and alpha synuclein that are thought to be causative agents in Alzhermer's and Parkinson's disorders, respectively. As K-GG peptides can also be produced from Nedd8 or ISG15 modified proteins, we quantified these proteins in the brain and found that their levels are less than 2% of ubiquitin. Together, this study demonstrates that a large number of neuronal proteins are modified by ubiquitination and provides a feasible method for profiling the ubiquitome in the brain.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chan Hyun Na"", ids = ""4625081""); list(name = ""Drew R Jones"", ids = ""13100316""); list(name = ""Yanling Yang"", ids = ""47796309""); list(name = ""Xusheng Wang"", ids = ""13867000""); list(name = ""Yanji Xu"", ids = ""50125851""); list(name = ""Junmin Peng"", ids = ""50980725"")",45067ba91bce77aba225dc6d285796f684281a0d; 21a620c9ac169f2d0abda273abb22212a40d557b; 765af77a0cd47661e3b2e50e27401aec379a07e3; 81b74ef3da0b877d88c9f3d41ddfbaa940f8ed30; adc30bb50a99623bc0fc78139655c2bd34f0ee6d; 440f9d4309e3ec99ea0ec840a4484ca0622490d0; 30c5816c97d26efa5925e4d7216dd0499648291b; dd5b13f2d8f9affc7682ae1b75a8a98337ae83b5; 977285f9680a7351ab29ff0c3c90a68c70f17235; c9f67ff0368eb5b8a42fad018795d1a224d15946; 24c49d194f1eca0da77baa17de4e52a4f1ecc1c4; a5f46f040944ff38395fabc3644e494a23f05bad; 20f8a7fba363b213ebd74afa5f2a71a76ee3f54e; ac7ee882014087cc26a227bdef79ca081bbe32c9; bbfa1d00c6cd193cfbf171b9ced7ca79b2c66fac; 08edcdd0d0e2994668dd8ca507b7322664024301; 9038b134b2472203c44318c1004e7095614bb9cb; 440611bd5d7923d719f621a300a37677699be9dc; 2e5e73eb9dd68e60ede81675a67a4e1e0044ebb0; bf9bc511a49a699340e3bb5f906fcab531888359; 2927b082b90d1447af1b612c65b2a1f151e052ac; afafa47fcb662fa7c76784a40b32ea6bc2991032; cf83c08b602b07374da16f9fbd1f47e7b7e58f44; af6a5f9ebdb154738c7722be5683ec4abfbf123d; 96e88a1e58209b847ff80bf662e547364d01d1a6; 6754c2b7cfa094e6e012c25bcb88349d3a3f07c0; a68aff3887cbb01e71a298616c4cbca47e417af0; b604b75d89b35c5894d005f0da66a4bf24ac18e9; 205c25243064fbb841cafed1cf803b5d2e23c236; fafb3ef9c70f1679cdc336bace82844555dea95e; 846cb94fa0efd99ed8ee6b63a84c45ddb4f24880; 428efabb86c6bcbed91642291901ae46eba25faa; a59d90980e5e692af1e53fe55ec694cc49e4e55e; 9f1bb18caa24b51aacd10794a7d859f54bb7914d; 36891af42c34e8fc2428b730432bdfb3235544de; 5513f13d2050c36869dc8cab4a4df4a0ebbe00db; 04edf1b22b25d5ae8ab3bd2eace743c1a9d78584; 5fa5b73ef513b0dad3bce20b05ddb759800bf187; 5aba16d2a83366ee408357592ac8216e07660c43; 09139d69b3fa0e1317c85773606379b2c70c03e8; afdf8db5db80b0bdeb0a03def636790539acfa9e; 5d1a0c8e8aa153f9c4b10043de8232feef8b13bc; cb34132023ae81975dd0dbeea84f7d48365b04b7; 0a36e5c96aa1693efa2e71f1a6589d9d1fc3280e; e352daf427a37d10c8bf979d412ac31eac67a66d; e0026c318f339f39df34e25d288350a4929ec0e3; bdae416e8dadcbe72460d52b36c85c7ced50ff96; 2259683d7f922a40caeef64f24840fb8dd3d101a; 90b7400cc3cb87f2a4937b7e0e2d78579b9fa580; 1a1588324e8d55229d1cf170c8f8be1a83305350; 4ee8394f9e51ff796eafb2b82cd9b4d75ff3151d; 0f6f361f034e972ab0fb93178546c91532652a39; 0aa2d64838e98cf53a4bee88244f9f892a8fda52; 6f1ee5b5790ba6a4cab985b65296910cf335f748; 0ab1a46ec1d5f3e78dda1833228dbd95b18df6e9; 7564eca489af4e73ca39aadedb40f0a0547438d8; fe26606704e25b1bf268428384ca96e9e5268d46; 76334e924185ad8880411fad85e716707db7135f; 121c09f514333580759fd32f3d5a1c350a30172a; 7c841c2de7571eddb6cf53941b4d9358e76e3819,cc8bddcc64631fea951565a1a05bf5ee65f433d4,Journal of proteome research,11 9,"

0365d012b1e0f2009a9bdb4c0e3e43991beb3b3d,Best practices for analysing microbiomes,"Complex microbial communities shape the dynamics of various environments, ranging from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to the soil. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and data analysis have provided drastic improvements in microbiome analyses, for example, in taxonomic resolution, false discovery rate control and other properties, over earlier methods. In this Review, we discuss the best practices for performing a microbiome study, including experimental design, choice of molecular analysis technology, methods for data analysis and the integration of multiple omics data sets. We focus on recent findings that suggest that operational taxonomic unit-based analyses should be replaced with new methods that are based on exact sequence variants, methods for integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data, and issues surrounding compositional data analysis, where advances have been particularly rapid. We note that although some of these approaches are new, it is important to keep sight of the classic issues that arise during experimental design and relate to research reproducibility. We describe how keeping these issues in mind allows researchers to obtain more insight from their microbiome data sets.Complex microbial communities shape the dynamics of various environments.

dc9b113d5e10c2d330285db3145d22385c47c1f1,An Alternative Cyclin-D1 Splice Site is Not Linked to Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Neoplasia,"Background Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract, primarily ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in patients with IBD. The CCND1 protein is the regulatory subunit of an enzyme that inactivates the retinoblastoma protein, a tumor suppressor protein, and promotes progression through the G1-S phase of the cell cycle. The CCND1 870G-A gene polymorphism influences susceptibility to colorectal cancer. The mutant allele of CCND1 in IBD-associated neoplasia leads to a greater frequency of alternate splicing during transcription, resulting in a more stable CCND1 protein. This creates a higher concentration of CCND1, facilitating easier passage through the G1/S checkpoint, abnormal cell cycle progression, and possibly carcinogenesis. Methods We conducted a case-control study involving 396 individuals with IBD. IBD subgroups included CD, UC, and indeterminate colitis (IC). We studied patients with sporadic colorectal cancer (n=75) and patients without gastrointestinal disease as a control group (n=93). We extracted DNA from blood and performed polymerase chain reaction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography to screen for mutations. We confirmed the polymorphism at nucleotide A870G in exon 4. For statistical analysis, we used exact analyses of two-way contingency tables. Power calculations were done and correction for multiple testing was performed by computing the false discovery rate (FDR). Results and discussion Our study had a power of 75% at a 0.05 significance level. A870G SNP allele frequency in the IBD group was 44.8%, compared to 51.6% in the control population. Only the IC group showed a significant association with CCND1 splice site after correction for multiple testing (FDR=0.042). There were no differences between the other IBD groups and controls. Conclusion We found an association between CCND1 A870G SNP and IC group only (p=0.014, FDR=0.042). However, our data do not show an association between CCND1 A870G SNP and CD-associated or UC-associated neoplasia.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ziad Kanaan"", ids = ""4590949""); list(name = ""Maurice Robert Eichenberger"", ids = ""2670909""); list(name = ""Michael Young"", ids = ""144842157""); list(name = ""Daniel Colliver"", ids = ""47303256""); list(name = ""Nigel W.

Sub-cellular fractionation permitted more in depth analysis of the proteome by reducing the sample complexity. A series of differential centrifugations produced nuclear, mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, microsomal, and sarcomeric enriched fractions of ischemic and non-ischemic tissues. The sarcomeric enriched fractions were labeled with isobaric tags for relative quantitation (iTRAQ), and then fractionated with an Agilent 3100 OFFGEL fractionator. The OFFGEL fractions were run on a Dionex U-3000 nano LC coupled to a ThermoFinnigan LTQ running in PQD (pulsed Q dissociation) mode. The peptides were analyzed using two search engines MASCOT (MatrixScience), and MassMatrix with false discovery rate of <5%. Compared to no fractionation prior to LC-MS/MS, fractionation with OFFGEL improved the identification of proteins approximately four-fold. We found that approximately 22 unique proteins in the sarcomeric enriched fraction had changed at least 20%.

c4ec3b973e8f901a05baf0002530a057ed3278f8,Does tumour biology determine surgical success in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer? A systematic literature review,"Background:Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer. Progression-free and overall survival is significantly related to surgical success and residual disease volume. It is unclear whether this survival advantage is due to an intrinsic biological element of the tumour cells which enables successful surgery and improved prognosis, or alternatively the number of tumour sustaining cells remaining irrespective of differences in biology.Methods:A systematic review of the literature was performed identifying studies that have investigated the association between biomarkers and surgical outcomes. We attempted validation of these results using The Cancer Genome Atlas ovarian cancer data sets.Results:Thirty studies were identified of which sixteen determined protein expression, eight gene expression and one DNA methylation in association with surgical debulking. Individualised linear models adjusting for batch, stage and age identified only expression of the genes MTDH and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) to be significantly associated with debulking surgery (P<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)<5%), although in the case of IGF1R this was in the opposite direction to previous findings.Conclusion:The majority of studies are limited by design, include heterogeneous samples and lack adjustment for major confounding factors. High quality detailed clinical annotations should be routinely collected in future to more accurately evaluate biomarkers of surgical outcome.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jayne Borley"", ids = ""1404762960""); list(name = ""Charlotte Wilhelm-Benartzi"", ids = ""1417571686""); list(name = ""Robin Brown"", ids = ""71479442""); list(name = ""S Ghaem-Maghami"", ids = ""116222953"")",71f33be2c1214e614b1cf1e7ba39cee6b39f393a; 08404f864871422b25d5d7a849770ed96c9eeb1e; ccb50e125e20e3612869228b4e5d99624c567d34; 246e09fdd0ad60e4a6c160ff9e842043b5e8136c; c8fc4c7d0b5199a321d0f053f960c18c83ecf33e; 94232140872a6e61aded96f591cf5f2c58d2f6ee; d8d0498dfde624ee3eae4b7f53746719d31f9d57; a4be4e4a2382cd343a1dbdbb9f1c8afd8944027a; 44cacc7fd3968a468afba78bd5dd783f89fa3f64; a841e6dab476f115ee155ddfa3454fbb7b8c80b7; f802e35b4f8d7e9dcaeb7d556e0d53fb3567d71e; 29db61444c0c61b0d05761a2c68e3e1daadabc22; 4fad7579c87ee372aaa840b22739cf126593b322; 89463edcb0efbfab360033ef53a95027e213bbfe; 76cda0b7029cc0d4fd7e802ccdc51141360cdf99; dece6f5f1bcbed3a1e0de1bb5666b835e7d9d1fb; 9111cdabc705ac664eadd3667a50e6d70b237abf; 6499e3f2b18c74eea0315bb796b4e1218230e903; 4e92d0ba472cce6ce3c8be03784bbcfd55e8aedc; 59631100431ccf7b2d647fbdfed927cee1d04c2e; f1c538e6635ea8384ec00154d9c7473a48c8eaf0; a825c27aa870247270fa529fc90c838127f08e32; 462522264c5a18f3bfc208562dcaf4e1d7301487; fe0a247f5f81fbfbfc716243c46df379e13ad760,fcd9a746ab35968306b19c65bad3aafda4bb7411; 5b4fe24fc8699794caf618ae3f39f4666d02aa45; 5b364c705f3b3920ca96d602ae534ae1b3e59b88; a2132cbcfba84a7d6ead8f5df295d109d05eab17; df93ca95d3ce919f14d4b2fa5aedcf23633e41c6; 89e81db351159d8a19c613b4c134529f0b940b22; 42bc279fe03d414b25a8681b91ba9ab2afad01ce; fc0b49f685793de87490af4a69492a9339efd011; 69ec617e5e323506412c553b71be1f2cef504270; 5b01531c37b4965b6094a7c4ceb9da01d0d81225; 893b4628aff09b4caf41e38755e82ed667c77edc; 55ab543cd52bffd56844521d3e4daa2e0a5790f3; 8cf581d53fa2de8a006edf421c959c2e595a9ed1; 4ce4d429fe8260ba0c3c2eab73804be8e25e355f; 530fce7a5889f615a9526aeaf0dd087ae39d93f5; d204ed0c089a8790c2d1c71e2879ec2baa2cf4a0; 34192abf493fc34ad9c59a5a20e12d7f9dd568a0; 1a22f96141719a6dcabae4c0d2c0fbc0694970e6; 0195896baddb78323ae90b5646ec3ccfee946d7a; f668849441bd0d39ed0ce82dd7b2c25d558e4492; c5331323e56ad9604561dac89eb64e8051310801; 713ad55a3a6f06f5bfed022425e4ca0a2a70bf37; c55ff8b73d814566dfae9252716f58f9e461036f; cc78f132905e350deae21aae84214a02c8f540b2; 1479ce89dea3c099503066d103625e30650854e8; 5ca8532c38a28da5913fd39f647d661427935ae3; 67c78de3517043562c356c7e415c8ac41e123107; 8a38f381c1fd213fd46a43477b8f9781f0cbc1f2; 732227424df4a4cbbb91278cc7d74ab9ecc116bd; 3e1d45d4bf344b254dfa8b150aeddf35d8d0592f; 79e505ada4812d0b09c66e820005f94b047bd479; 8f3021260895e40d446be2e749a6a72d5e1d7b1e; 857447cc0487b14f670bbd301497670037f1f8d1; 2fa9ed987178a24060463323996b6ac4db8af21c; 995fab15b8c5c6844db4a8c63c5080a1f00a1b1d; b55878977598b1ee25c45162be24b61b09174e6c; 031a060be6186a9503c483370e273c8e55dd1144; 336fa47b2349afd66bccee0a8a4b54c4cac3d1c6; 5b345f870e1ea8ecd2d65e08d11bdb7c9bf1615f; 08d2f735fdc029a1bc0ba4ab41b3437176939796; e58c9af318c38d875b2f033bd46b96721b24c1e4; d06f73e80428db812f885c3c1ff150cbd8ad7b37; a2219c101f67c3db8379f2dfc90ca5f29d1edba1; d3cab86bf3c790f105ba5bc10b636b4fdcfb3d98; d7109287fb1a53e762ef6c7328bc691770103365; 7550a72c51f8bcfd9fb6886d1a74a2a000c8a12e; 581287478f2af0fe5465a126e48afa20284b7252; 24a250bef2d5d095ca036238e90a24ea6ad1a0ed; 49849ecd89da5158b40d8e778d29fcd8b9b64b5d; 60dd31aeff40de6c512fed8cd01e93cd39a482d9; 60326cc695859cff3773679cb262efe7b40197f4; 0b190179092c9061aa65d62e7d6c63e9048cf04a; 42c265a5003dace5454b8ab23c8dbde1f41111ee; 1b4c314f75c6edb7b79662d6875b942f26deefa0; 2d5b040efec060b33c1c4ef72231655de93398c4; 19094be671312539b48f0ecd51821edb33011129; b09ff528523c6b3a5627da34836126820cf1b0e9; 03c3d274203a98a636560e705b97a82ba4db3f19,British Journal of Cancer,107,1069 - 1074
4710d00a57e2a764f65c89d1a83297b7556e6fa9,Bioinformatic and experimental evidence for suicidal and catalytic plant THI4s,"Like fungi and some prokaryotes, plants use a thiazole synthase (THI4) to make the thiazole precursor of thiamin. Fungal THI4s are suicide enzymes that destroy an essential active-site Cys residue to obtain the sulfur atom needed for thiazole formation. In contrast, certain prokaryotic THI4s have no active-site Cys, use sulfide as sulfur donor, and are truly catalytic. The presence of a conserved active-site Cys in plant THI4s and other indirect evidence implies that they are suicidal. To confirm this, we complemented the Arabidopsis tz-1 mutant, which lacks THI4 activity, with a His-tagged Arabidopsis THI4 construct. LC-MS analysis of tryptic peptides of the THI4 extracted from leaves showed that the active-site Cys was predominantly in desulfurated form, consistent with THI4 having a suicide mech-anism in planta. Unexpectedly, transcriptome datamining and deep proteome profiling showed that barley, wheat, and oat have both a widely expressed canonical THI4 with an active-site Cys, and a THI4-like paralog (non-Cys THI4) that has no active-site Cys and is the major type of THI4 in devel-oping grains. Transcriptomic evidence also indicated that barley, wheat, and oat grains synthesize thiamin de novo, implying that their non-Cys THI4s synthesize thiazole. Structure modeling supported this inference, as did demonstration that non-Cys THI4s have significant capacity to complement thia-zole auxotrophy in Escherichia coli. There is thus a prima facie case that non-Cys cereal THI4s, like their prokaryotic counterparts, are catalytic thiazole synthases. Bioenergetic calculations show that, relative to suicide THI4s, such enzymes could save substantial energy during the grain filling period.

The inference of gene covariation networks from observational data can be challenging, especially considering the large number of players involved and the small number of biological replicates available for analysis.ResultsWe propose a new statistical method for estimating the number of erroneous edges in reconstructed networks that strongly enhances commonly used inference approaches. This method is based on a special relationship between sign of correlation (positive/negative) and directionality (up/down) of gene regulation, and allows for the identification and removal of approximately half of all erroneous edges. Using the mathematical model of Bayesian networks and positive correlation inequalities we establish a mathematical foundation for our method. Analyzing existing biological datasets, we find a strong correlation between the results of our method and false discovery rate (FDR). Furthermore, simulation analysis demonstrates that our method provides a more accurate estimate of network error than FDR.ConclusionsThus, our study provides a new robust approach for improving reconstruction of covariation networks.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Eugene Koonin, Sergei Maslov, Daniel Yasumasa Takahashi.",2016,Biology; Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Anatoly Yambartsev"", ids = ""49463038""); list(name = ""Michael A.

51bfa955a9fc33f0ce85094e827c58829fb44804,In-depth profiling of post-translational modifications on the related transcription factor complexes TFIID and SAGA.,"The basal transcription factor TFIID and the chromatin-modifying complex SAGA, which have several subunits in common, are crucial for transcription regulation. Here, we describe an in-depth profiling of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on both TFIID and SAGA from yeast. We took a multipronged approach using high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in combination with the proteases Trypsin, Chymotrypsin and Glu-C. The cumulative peptide identification data, at a false discovery rate <1%, allowed us to cover most TFIID and SAGA subunit sequences to near completion. Additionally, for TFIID/SAGA subunits, we identified 118/102 unique phosphorylated and 54/61 unique lysine acetylated sites. Especially, several lysine residues on the SAGA subunits Spt7p and Sgf73p were found to be acetylated. Using a spectral counting approach, we found that the shared subunit TAF5p is phosphorylated to a significant greater extent in SAGA than in TFIID. Finally, we were able to map for the first time the cleavage site in Spt7p that is related to formation of the SAGA-like complex SLIK/SALSA. In general, our combination of tandem affinity enrichment, digestion with different proteases, extensive prefractionation and high-resolution LC-MS identifies a large number of PTMs of TFIID and SAGA/SLIK that might aid in future functional studies on these transcription factors.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nikolai Mischerikow"", ids = ""4482101""); list(name = ""Gianpiero Spedale"", ids = ""6634569""); list(name = ""A.

67e67690e83e62611ba788001ea9ec337d6c262e,Brain Poster Session: Transcriptional Regulation,"Objectives: Hypoxia Preconditioning (HP) in the brain is a well-known endogenous protective paradigm in which pre-exposure to sub-lethal hypoxia can protect the brain from injury due to lethal hypoxia or ischemia occurring 24 to 72 h later. Though HP has been studied extensively, its mechanisms are still not understood. Since de novo gene transcription and protein expression are required for the hypoxia preconditioning, we have extended previous studies by performing whole genome expression profiling of individual brain regions of adult mice and carefully following the entire time course of hypoxia preconditioning. Methods: Adult C57BL/6 male mice (8 to 9 weeks old) were exposed to systemic hypoxia (8% O2) for 3 h and allowed to recover in normoxia for 24 h. Animals were sacrificed and the brains were removed and dissected into individual brain regions at multiple time points during the 3 h hypoxia and subsequent 24 h of reoxygenation. Total RNA was purified and gene expression assessed with Affymetrix Mouse Expression 430 2.0 arrays. One-Way ANOVA with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons was used to identify differentially regulated genes. The differentially regulated genes were then subjected to a variety of bioinformatics analyses including functional annotation, pathway and promoter sequence analyses. Result: Among the brain regions examined, cerebellum demonstrated the largest numbers of gene expression changes following hypoxia preconditioning. The greatest numbers of regulated genes in cerebellum were observed immediately after the 3 h of hypoxia and 1 h after reoxygenation. In contrast to the forebrain, where down regulation of gene expression predominated over up-regulation events during this time period, cerebellum exhibited a predominant up-regulation of genes following HP. Compared to hippocampus, substantially more genes involved in cell survival regulation were up-regulated in cerebellum during this time period. Besides hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), various nuclear receptor transcription factors were found to play important roles in regulating the unique gene expression response cerebellum after HP. Most notably, a novel group of genes regulated by transcription factor hepatic nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A) have been identified as being hypoxia responsive genes in cerebellum. Conclusions: HP induces both time-dependent and region-dependent gene expression responses. The substantial number of unique genes regulated in cerebellum may be critical not only for the survival of the organism during systemic hypoxia, but also for the maturation of neuroprotection effect of HP. Region-specific transcription factors, including HNF4A, likely contribute to region specific genomic responses to hypoxia preconditioning.",2009,,"list(name = ""Mar ArbonÃ©s"", ids = ""123144331""); list(name = ""David FernÃ¡ndez-LÃ³pez"", ids = ""1403507771""); list(name = ""Ignacio Lizasoain"", ids = ""2613031""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a A Moro"", ids = ""46862234""); list(name = ""Eva Cano"", ids = ""49713755"")",,,Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism,29,S565 - S567

Expression of miRNAs is altered in skeletal muscle, plasma, and saliva following exertion. Women display unique physiologic responses to endurance exercise, and miRNAs respond to pathologic states in sex-specific patterns. However sex-specific miRNA responses to exercise remain unexplored. This study utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing to measure changes in salivary RNA expression among 25 collegiate runners following a single long-distance run. RNA concentrations in pre- and post-run saliva was assessed through alignment and quantification of 4,694 miRNAs and 27,687 mRNAs. Pair-wise Wilcoxon rank-sum test identified miRNAs with significant [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05] post-run changes. Associations between miRNA levels and predicted mRNA targets were explored with Pearson correlations. Differences in miRNA patterns between men ( n = 13) and women ( n = 12) were investigated with two-way analysis of variance. Results revealed 122 salivary miRNAs with post-run changes. The eight miRNAs with the largest changes were miR-3671, miR-5095 (downregulated); and miR-7154-3p, miR-200b-5p, miR-5582-3p, miR-6859-3p, miR-6751-5p, miR-4419a (upregulated). Predicted mRNA targets for these miRNAs represented 15 physiologic processes, including glycerophospholipid metabolism (FDR = 0.042), aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption (FDR = 0.049), and arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy (FDR = 0.018). Twenty-six miRNA/mRNA pairs had associated changes in post-run levels. Three miRNAs (miR-4675, miR-6745, miR-6746-3p) demonstrated sex-specific responses to exercise. Numerous salivary miRNAs change in response to endurance running and target the expression of genes involved in metabolism, fluid balance, and musculoskeletal adaptations. A subset of miRNAs may differentiate the metabolic response to exercise in men and women.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Steven D Hicks"", ids = ""48248516""); list(name = ""P.

db081b8543d03b34bfe14168f29d12eb9a398385,Transient transcriptional events in human skeletal muscle at the outset of concentric resistance exercise training.,"We sought to ascertain the time course of transcriptional events that occur in human skeletal muscle at the outset of resistance exercise (RE) training in RE naive individuals and determine whether the magnitude of response was associated with exercise-induced muscle damage. Sixteen RE naive men were recruited; eight underwent two sessions of 5 Ã— 30 maximum isokinetic knee extensions (180Â°/s) separated by 48 h. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis, obtained from different sites, were taken at baseline and 24 h after each exercise bout. Eight individuals acted as nonexercise controls with biopsies obtained at the same time intervals. Transcriptional changes were assessed by microarray and protein levels of heat shock protein (HSP) 27 and Î±B-crystallin in muscle cross sections by immunohistochemistry as a proxy measure of muscle damage. In control subjects, no probe sets were significantly altered (false discovery rate < 0.05), and HSP27 and Î±B-crystallin protein remained unchanged throughout the study. In exercised subjects, significant intersubject variability following the initial RE bout was observed in the muscle transcriptome, with greatest changes occurring in subjects with elevated HSP27 and Î±B-crystallin protein. Following the second bout, the transcriptome response was more consistent, revealing a cohort of probe sets associated with immune activation, the suppression of oxidative metabolism, and ubiquitination, as differentially regulated. The results reveal that the initial transcriptional response to RE is variable in RE naive volunteers, potentially associated with muscle damage and unlikely to reflect longer term adaptations to RE training. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple time points when determining the transcriptional response to RE and associated physiological adaptation.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew J.

635791929886b0fa914f8c2d68a98085e45d605f,Predicting electrophoretic mobility of proteoforms for large-scale top-down proteomics.,"Large-scale top-down proteomics characterizes proteoforms in cells globally with high confidence and high throughput using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) or capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-MS/MS. The false discovery rate (FDR) from the target-decoy database search is typically deployed to filter identified proteoforms to ensure high-confidence identifications (IDs). It has been demonstrated that the FDRs in top-down proteomics can be drastically underestimated. An alternative approach to the FDR can be useful for further evaluating the confidence of proteoform IDs after database search. We argue that predicting retention/migration time of proteoforms from the RPLC/CZE separation accurately and comparing their predicted and experimental separation time could be a useful and practical approach. Based on our knowledge, there is still no report in the literature about predicting separation time of proteoforms using large top-down proteomics datasets. In this pilot study, for the first time, we evaluated various semi-empirical models for predicting proteoforms' electrophoretic mobility (Âµef) using large-scale top-down proteomics datasets from CZE-MS/MS. We achieved a linear correlation between experimental and predicted Âµef of E. coli proteoforms (R2=0.98) with a simple semi-empirical model, which utilizes the number of charges and molecular mass of each proteoform as the parameters. Our modeling data suggest that the complete unfolding of proteoforms during CZE separation benefits the prediction of their Âµef. Our results also indicate that N-terminal acetylation and phosphorylation both decrease proteoforms' charge by roughly one charge unit.",2020,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daoyang Chen"", ids = ""16049455""); list(name = ""Rachele A.

1650c3af3b51421ccbf835cad3092e46cdfceda0,Multiple Tests Based on a Gaussian Approximation of the Unitary Events Method with Delayed Coincidence Count,"The unitary events (UE) method is one of the most popular and efficient methods used over the past decade to detect patterns of coincident joint spike activity among simultaneously recorded neurons. The detection of coincidences is usually based on binned coincidence count (GrÃ¼n, 1996), which is known to be subject to loss in synchrony detection (GrÃ¼n, Diesmann, Grammont, Riehle, & Aertsen, 1999). This defect has been corrected by the multiple shift coincidence count (GrÃ¼n et al., 1999). The statistical properties of this count have not been further investigated until this work, the formula being more difficult to deal with than the original binned count. First, we propose a new notion of coincidence count, the delayed coincidence count, which is equal to the multiple shift coincidence count when discretized point processes are involved as models for the spike trains. Moreover, it generalizes this notion to nondiscretized point processes, allowing us to propose a new gaussian approximation of the count. Since unknown parameters are involved in the approximation, we perform a plug-in step, where unknown parameters are replaced by estimated ones, leading to a modification of the approximating distribution. Finally the method takes the multiplicity of the tests into account via a Benjamini and Hochberg approach (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995), to guarantee a prescribed control of the false discovery rate. We compare our new method, MTGAUE (multiple tests based on a gaussian approximation of the unitary events) and the UE method proposed in GrÃ¼n et al. (1999) over various simulations, showing that MTGAUE extends the validity of the previous method. In particular, MTGAUE is able to detect both profusion and lack of coincidences with respect to the independence case and is robust to changes in the underlying model. Furthermore MTGAUE is applied on real data.",2014,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christine Tuleau-Malot"", ids = ""1403591523""); list(name = ""Amel Rouis"", ids = ""47270918""); list(name = ""Franck Grammont"", ids = ""2924172""); list(name = ""Patricia Reynaud-Bouret"", ids = ""1380244052"")",fafc2f080a33164c3cccdc5a41b32fef736a0687; 86a9084c42a10d05ee734ebd981e26409379c7df; 09552a213706eba94547902d001e5c1743d4776f; 797648483f4daab9e47e4ba2ed63cc47ade3211a; c7b876c012dc513640a167bd7010b5a0b622ccfe; 166fe2bbc14585f8e9d1dfb89a90211e1ed47886; a7bb7b490554a60cd1ad32dc9f9658f668131611; 2721c8fcb683734bba238a606f0bce63dd242e5c; 4fdc4696ca365a0e531550de98d6f595f21247bc; 6d3e1332afa51b288b5b923656d620125294ab98; 04b552f46ca64cbe3edfc7d8f8e1034adea14109; 3f5bbe7400e563186eebcb020ad015cd5f18b2e5; 9759369c78d47d193021bc20cf6a6ccde23c397f,90913cb212c59553e35744028fe10751f817c6d0; 9fb10a3c2dcec939784ce208e0e7e7fda4be895c; a876fe0c7c7bebeb7e978d5679af1091b1b963df; 75596d36f2ade9ef6702d1c39c4773a550f16933; d9102702973d1cbf55b6cf6dfa0e5f149a42c742; 8bcefc9ee5dd655ea92c73262520400243081b57; 5393359c73fd19dc95cdfdac1dd741e65be79a49; 8cb51892a08af06c0bf1f5472d05f9d490bc3fec; 0676d2f3c119204df10ff8f0bcef0311899425fd; e1b21679f661a995b5dc980c6fd8617d0e742833; dcf9d8caa765d1c5b128fd05ca0ad4b8634c70c8; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; e2d0af44cc40b037076bfd38568296dcc2e30213; b0743c116e920bc9036d91084557ead6a868a4bc; ceba41d1f0dbc7ebb1aeab2c1d5d173da43145f5; bd4c02b8737dae2500701647145644a61c702410; 6d96ee1097a1eb65c9a70ebd668d017d5e3c3689; e38b39b2b634252e1c321f493cc7791d5e605d9f; 2a9ecc0594e08e02b264a17c30620cdc18eed7f5; 9d8ead4da20f90d79a9effa221c9d67afe84032b; a7bb7b490554a60cd1ad32dc9f9658f668131611; 267cf324f04f1993227f780af3555ea7d6c59c26; fbd04d69eb794b831c9e373237d8bf8718a03686; 1600ed57ee5dda71ea827d59ffc2075fdcf3025a; b9862e612f37133e6279f438c373546d324ce1d1; cdb33b7bfab15a28919536b7b5f8698f972d2ae0; 75c682755ba80bd12c17a57b275e1abd04d60bbd; 59c890ec8892f60c1d83fc90c2e2eb62fb7e3b08; f2757018aa230dba01d99f3a7917c202214580a5; c8e40799997b217ed2dd74987dc70fa3e69550b1; 97bccffea2579696a651e3b393d982609564bfc4; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 16c7b16317ef346b6a8ec7cb1ef8e3f58288c934; 4bf7b0d5139128d41a1b0812583c7b3bd2565557; d6430bff964282af47cbd173f8c8694cf74a68e1; d23122ba104227efd2a708c70749d2f2e9320f19; 1287d023e382c93e18d7bea95a04f1eaf36c2d4a; 23dcf0057cb68067c9b64a2551e867d755e23f2b; 354aa5de3622f0340fe9d67c427ab042fe70d2a6; 73cbc6e3f7cd1f49ec97c44181a4054676e38c04; 7f77306efba70d922853ee01c6dfef3cf04a7c54; 696b11e72291c2cc364e95676ff0089245c27176; 7f38f0ae7623084fa9eba55e59bd5c1da58300c6; 4fe89e3edc1db6c4ef4455772d46ef0c77b3b325; db58b0512f554560945d9a04ac572e11899f1075; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2c9b73d527f60031446d4442b83015decac028e0; c90c3c10cba3c4700298ab2883c2bfecd7401fae; 6b96ea4830d172f28722dda6131d1e05b972c577; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 68be37e94e2e5455e278a3e34f272a66e66161c1; 6650bef8fe596026dbc3d2bb25f1a6da8766e378; fee628d04020b6b886bf72cdd3e3c8e62861d095; efe85d06a2609bf72c4004394de8e3cea3aca94a; 628f62195957203ef763be7dc35b47814eff39e4; e62f7643f616aaad65ffd47155a53bfa325e455d; 5720f1bc03046b99aaeeca7d177a4aa63bde3a6e; 05033d42f5c672c4a7bf5ab0b0571392c732a9c5; a15785f9417ee471f1e83eef0bf939b210319471; 4fc1b5426ffab454e9d74e8105c31029696b4cba; 08eb84cc7b542c8597a18b68e6994f96e71b566b; 006a34dcdfc63c5b7a2cf4d0b76cecedbb4b93d9; 4977756d2f23c07292d8d7ca28098bcd5bdf3f89; d72dcb82bcc6c65f577793ddaf4fdfd031887669; cac363a6e7b993d85b058bcccf066c98a0aaec19; dd13df7add01cd431bba5094369dc797b89d9aec; f836e2ae6e9d785b3325377b34200560ab336b9d; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 7baa8481de0c606b50e9f557f903793ce0c72254; 27485db6f0ba2bb021f7873f484758ffa389039f; dcc618876f460791780271595d823c2bd1d26f6f; a29b8fcd3a14ad6d10c7cf659cc882dc2a57c8e4; b403cbe1ae630164c5e3b3ecf1060a0ad1deb0df; 6e58c073c1460bbe8327a8f13cb105f424361c5f; a27d14e2f9b0c94143a0476c1f2ed40f65e0dfc0; 42a3a659a407a7bc528fa10acc1b15ac88c61e76; 332355a31f818d32a38268ab4c302401361b37d4; f3cf27059154f2f6cdffb9767313bb2d415ab920; bf1be0153ac2fe8873f5b1432c61946a1ac39a43; 85005dcf574c9fe503f80ed340fa081adc162f0f,Neural Computation,26,1408-1454
168c5764a449b2f5ee53e39a06feece0950b7c56,Simultaneous Pancreas Kidney Transplantation Improves Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy with Improved Valsalva Ratio as the Most Precocious Test,"Background
Simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation is a proven option of treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and related end-stage renal disease. There is discrepancy between the results of different studies about the impact of prolonged normalization of glucose metabolism achieved by SPK on the course of diabetic complications including severe forms of diabetic neuropathy. The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in patients undergoing SPK transplantation and its evolution 10 years after transplantation.


Methods
Prospective study of 81 patients transplanted in a single center from year 2002 to 2015. Autonomic function was assessed using cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs). CARTs were made before SPK transplantation and during the follow-up. Evolution of tests after SPK transplantation was evaluated by contrasting hypotheses (paired tests). Multiple testing was adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a false discovery rate of 10%.


Results
48 males and 33 females, mean age 37.4 Â± 5.7 years, mean BMI 24.0 Â± 3.4â€‰kg/m2, and mean duration of diabetes 25.5 Â± 6.5 years, received SPK transplantation. Ten years after SPK transplantation, 56 patients re tained the pancreatic graft (42 of them with normofunctioning pancreas and 14 with low doses of insulin therapy). These 42 patients were selected for the autonomic study. Before transplant procedure, all CART results were abnormal. After SPK transplantation, paired test analysis showed an improvement of systolic blood pressure (SBP) response to orthostasis at the 5th year after SPK (p = 0.03), as well as improvement of the Valsalva ratio at the 3rd (p < 0.001) and 5th (p = 0.001) year after SPK.

ac2ba3917829637529434d9071e21d8e662bd054,Genome-Wide Associations of Gene Expression Variation in Humans,"The exploration of quantitative variation in human populations has become one of the major priorities for medical genetics. The successful identification of variants that contribute to complex traits is highly dependent on reliable assays and genetic maps. We have performed a genome-wide quantitative trait analysis of 630 genes in 60 unrelated Utah residents with ancestry from Northern and Western Europe using the publicly available phase I data of the International HapMap project. The genes are located in regions of the human genome with elevated functional annotation and disease interest including the ENCODE regions spanning 1% of the genome, Chromosome 21 and Chromosome 20q12-13.2. We apply three different methods of multiple test correction, including Bonferroni, false discovery rate, and permutations. For the 374 expressed genes, we find many regions with statistically significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with expression variation in lymphoblastoid cell lines after correcting for multiple tests. Based on our analyses, the signal proximal (cis-) to the genes of interest is more abundant and more stable than distal and trans across statistical methodologies. Our results suggest that regulatory polymorphism is widespread in the human genome and show that the 5-kb (phase I) HapMap has sufficient density to enable linkage disequilibrium mapping in humans. Such studies will significantly enhance our ability to annotate the non-coding part of the genome and interpret functional variation. In addition, we demonstrate that the HapMap cell lines themselves may serve as a useful resource for quantitative measurements at the cellular level.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Barbara E.

119f0271b620b6ba8e5ad2362542d6242aa8fe18,Convolutional neural network-based annotation of bacterial type IV secretion system effectors with enhanced accuracy and reduced false discovery.,"The type IV bacterial secretion system (SS) is reported to be one of the most ubiquitous SSs in nature and can induce serious conditions by secreting type IV SS effectors (T4SEs) into the host cells. Recent studies mainly focus on annotating new T4SE from the huge amount of sequencing data, and various computational tools are therefore developed to accelerate T4SE annotation. However, these tools are reported as heavily dependent on the selected methods and their annotation performance need to be further enhanced. Herein, a convolution neural network (CNN) technique was used to annotate T4SEs by integrating multiple protein encoding strategies. First, the annotation accuracies of nine encoding strategies integrated with CNN were assessed and compared with that of the popular T4SE annotation tools based on independent benchmark. Second, false discovery rates of various models were systematically evaluated by (1) scanning the genome of Legionella pneumophila subsp. ATCC 33152 and (2) predicting the real-world non-T4SEs validated using published experiments. Based on the above analyses, the encoding strategies, (a) position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), (b) protein secondary structure & solvent accessibility (PSSSA) and (c) one-hot encoding scheme (Onehot), were identified as well-performing when integrated with CNN. Finally, a novel strategy that collectively considers the three well-performing models (CNN-PSSM, CNN-PSSSA and CNN-Onehot) was proposed, and a new tool (CNN-T4SE, https://idrblab.org/cnnt4se/) was constructed to facilitate T4SE annotation. All in all, this study conducted a comprehensive analysis on the performance of a collection of encoding strategies when integrated with CNN, which could facilitate the suppression of T4SS in infection and limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jiajun Hong"", ids = ""123844219""); list(name = ""Yongchao Luo"", ids = ""150350164""); list(name = ""Minjie Mou"", ids = ""2506665""); list(name = ""Jianbo Fu"", ids = ""2598130""); list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""41071620""); list(name = ""Weiwei Xue"", ids = ""48122625""); list(name = ""Tian Xie"", ids = ""48391145""); list(name = ""Lin Tao"", ids = ""145403838""); list(name = ""Yan Lou"", ids = ""144736841""); list(name = ""Feng Zhu"", ids = ""144571173"")",94ed583ccda59645459330b009a526ec795691bf; b13d483db7cbb9a2fddf7e6597438ee224b4b78d,,Briefings in bioinformatics,,
6fd8ec9024d1e8f47c500e1537f2dfed0e5baf7f,Infant sex-specific placental cadmium and DNA methylation associations.,"BACKGROUND
Recent evidence suggests that maternal cadmium (Cd) burden and fetal growth associations may vary by fetal sex. However, mechanisms contributing to these differences are unknown.


OBJECTIVES
Among 24 maternal-infant pairs, we investigated infant sex-specific associations between placental Cd and placental genome-wide DNA methylation.


METHODS
We used ANOVA models to examine sex-stratified associations of placental Cd (dichotomized into high/low Cd using sex-specific Cd median cutoffs) with DNA methylation at each cytosine-phosphate-guanine site or region. Statistical significance was defined using a false discovery rate cutoff (<0.10).


RESULTS
Medians of placental Cd among females and males were 5 and 2 ng/g, respectively. Among females, three sites (near ADP-ribosylation factor-like 9 (ARL9), siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3 (SIAH3), and heparin sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 4 (HS3ST4) and one region on chromosome 7 (including carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT) and TP5S target 1 (TP53TG1)) were hypomethylated in high Cd placentas. Among males, high placental Cd was associated with methylation of three sites, two (hypomethylated) near MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus (MECOM) and one (hypermethylated) near spalt-like transcription factor 1 (SALL1), and two regions (both hypomethylated, one on chromosome 3 including MECOM and another on chromosome 8 including rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 10 (ARHGEF10). Differentially methylated sites were at or close to transcription start sites of genes involved in cell damage response (SIAH3, HS3ST4, TP53TG1) in females and cell differentiation, angiogenesis and organ development (MECOM, SALL1) in males.


CONCLUSIONS
Our preliminary study supports infant sex-specific placental Cd-DNA methylation associations, possibly accounting for previously reported differences in Cd-fetal growth associations across fetal sex. Larger studies are needed to replicate and extend these findings. Such investigations may further our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms underlying maternal Cd burden with suboptimal fetal growth associations.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""April F Mohanty"", ids = ""46924291""); list(name = ""Fred M.

4fbcf473d3db3593ea42a54bc6dd1b26b9691de8,Gene expression signatures differentiate ovarian/peritoneal serous carcinoma from breast carcinoma in effusions,"Ovarian/primary peritoneal carcinoma and breast carcinoma are the gynaecological cancers that most frequently involve the serosal cavities.With the objective of improving on the limited diagnostic panel currently available for the differential diagnosis of these two malignancies,as well as to define tumour-specific biological targets, we compared their global gene expression patterns. Gene expression profiles of 10 serous ovarian/peritoneal and eight ductal breast carcinoma effusions were analysed using the HumanRef-8 BeadChip from Illumina.Differentially expressed candidate genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using all 54,675 genes in the array separated ovarian from breast carcinoma samples. We identified 288 unique probes that were significantly differentially expressed in the two cancers by greater than 3.5-fold, of which 81 and 207 were overexpressed in breast and ovarian/peritoneal carcinoma, respectively. SAM analysis identified 1078 differentially expressed probes with false discovery rate less than 0.05. Genes overexpressed in breast carcinoma included TFF1, TFF3, FOXA1, CA12, GATA3, SDC1, PITX1, TH, EHFD1, EFEMP1, TOB1 and KLF2. Genes overexpressed in ovarian/peritoneal carcinoma included SPON1, RBP1, MFGE8, TM4SF12, MMP7, KLK5/6/7, FOLR1/3,PAX8, APOL2 and NRCAM.

Introduction. Glucocorticoids (GC) such as prednisolone (Pred) and dexamethasone (Dex) are critical drugs in multi-agent chemotherapy protocols used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The NOD/SCID ALL xenograft mouse model is a clinically relevant model in which the mice develop a systemic leukemia which retains the fundamental biological characteristics of the original disease. Here we report the results of a study evaluating the NOD/SCID xenograft model to investigate GC-induced gene expression.

Methods. Cells from a GC-sensitive xenograft derived from a child with B-cell precursor ALL were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice. Engraftment, defined as the proportion of human vs mouse CD45+ cells in the peripheral blood, was monitored by serial weekly tail-vein sampling. When engraftment levels reached >50%, the mice were randomised and treated with either dexamethasone 15 mg/kg or vehicle control by intraperitoneal injection, and harvested at 0, 8, 24 or 48 h thereafter. The 48 hour groups received a second dose of vehicle or Dex at 24 hours. At the defined timepoints, the mice were euthanized and lymphoblasts harvested from the spleen. RNA was extracted, amplified and hybridised onto Illumina WG-6 V3 chips. The data was pre-processed using variance-stabilisation transformation, and quantile normalisation. Differential expression was determined using limma by comparing all treated groups to time 0, with the positive False Discovery Rate correction for multiple testing. Hierarchical clustering was used to compare groups to each other. The stability of results when reducing the number of replicates was assessed using the Recovery Score method. Functional analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and comparison to publicly available microarray data using parametric GSEA.

Results. The 8 hour Dex-treated timepoint had the most number of significantly differentially expressed genes (see [Table][1]), with fewer observed at the 24 and 48 hour Dex-treated timepoints. There was minimal significant differential gene expression across the time-matched controls. At the 8 hour timepoint, ZBTB16 , a known GC-induced gene, was the most significantly upregulated gene. Other significantly differentially expressed genes included TSC22D3 and SOCS1 , both downstream targets of the glucocorticoid receptor (upregulated), and BCL-2 and C-MYC (downregulated). GSEA at 8 hours revealed a significant upregulation of catabolic pathways and downregulation of pathways associated with cell proliferation, particularly C-MYC. GSEA at 24 hours revealed enrichment of pathways associated with NF-kB. Replicate analysis revealed that at the 8 hour Dex treated timepoint, a dataset with high signal and differential expression, using data from 3 replicates instead of 4 resulted in excellent recovery scores of >0.9. However at other timepoints with less signal very poor recovery scores were obtained using 3 replicates. We compared our data to publicly available datasets of GC-induced genes in ALL (Schmidt et al, Blood 2006; Rainer et al, Leukemia 2009) using parametric GSEA, which revealed that the 8 hour gene expression data obtained from the NOD/SCID xenograft model clustered with data from primary patient samples (Schmidt) rather than the cell line data (Rainer). The 24 and 48 hour datasets clustered separately from all other datasets by this method, reflecting fewer and predominantly downregulated gene expression at these timepoints.

Conclusions: The NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model provides a reproducible experimental model system in which to investigate clinically-relevant mechanisms of GC-induced gene regulation in ALL; the 8 hour timepoint provides the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes; time-matched controls are redundant and excellent recovery scores can be obtained with 3 replicates.

b906b01acab4939e67a9db11e8f713aa066a3904,Metabolic perturbations in classic galactosemia beyond the Leloir pathway: Insights from an untargeted metabolomic study,"Classic galactosemia (CG) is an autosomal recessive disorder that impacts close to 1/50000 live births in the United States, with varying prevalence in other countries. Following exposure to milk, which contains high levels of galactose, affected infants may experience rapid onset and progression of potentially lethal symptoms. With the benefit of early diagnosis, generally by newborn screening, and immediate and lifelong dietary restriction of galactose, the acute sequelae of disease can be prevented or resolved. However, long-term complications are common, and despite many decades of research, the bases of these complications remain unexplained. As a step toward defining the underlying pathophysiology of long-term outcomes in CG, we applied an untargeted metabolomic approach with mass spectrometry and dual liquid chromatography, comparing thousands of small molecules in plasma samples from 183 patients and 31 controls. All patients were on galactose-restricted diets. Using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods, we identified 252 differentially abundant features from anion exchange chromatography and 167 differentially abundant features from C18 chromatography. Mapping these discriminatory features to putative metabolites and biochemical pathways revealed 14 significantly perturbed pathways; these included multiple redox, amino acid, and mitochondrial pathways, among others. Finally, we tested whether any discriminatory features also distinguished cases with mild vs more severe long-term outcomes and found multiple candidates, of which one achieved false discovery rate-adjusted qâ€‰<â€‰0.1. These results extend substantially from prior targeted studies of metabolic perturbation in CG and offer a new approach to identifying candidate modifiers and targets for intervention.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""S.

9e5bc4bc7f455faa8c8aaa9c7bb23ea240a10a57,Combining protein ratio p-values as a pragmatic approach to the analysis of multirun iTRAQ experiments.,"iTRAQ labeling of peptides is widely used for quantitative comparison of biological samples using mass spectrometry. However, iTRAQ determined protein ratios have varying credibility depending on the number and quality of the peptide ratios used to generate them, and accounting for this becomes problematic particularly in the multirun scenario needed for larger scale biological studies. One approach to this problem relies on the use of sophisticated statistical global models using peptide ratios rather than working directly with the protein ratios, but these yield complex models whose solution relies on computational approaches such as stage-wise regression, which are nontrivial to run and verify. Here we evaluate an alternative pragmatic approach to finding differentially expressed proteins based on combining protein ratio p-values across experiments in a fashion similar to running a meta-analysis across different iTRAQ runs. Our approach uses the well-established Stouffer's Z-transform for combining p-values, alongside a ratio trend consistency measure, which we introduce. We evaluate this method with data from two iTRAQ experiments using plant and animal models. We show that in the specific context of iTRAQ data analysis this method has advantages of simplicity, high tolerance of run variability, low false discovery rate, and emphasis on proteins identified with high confidence.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dana Pascovici"", ids = ""2785452""); list(name = ""Xiaomin Song"", ids = ""144464544""); list(name = ""Peter S.

cd9d6e2b40644d202b9454b8ad9b6d34fbc3a8a4,Fast evolution of core promoters in primate genomes.,"Despite much interest in regulatory evolution, how promoters have evolved remains poorly studied, mainly owing to paucity of data on promoter regions. Using a new set of high-quality experimentally determined core promoters of the human genome, we conducted a comparative analysis of 2,492 human and rhesus macaque promoters and their neighboring nearly neutral regions. We found that the core promoters have an average rate of nucleotide substitution substantially higher than that at 4-fold degenerate sites and only slightly lower than that for the assumed neutral controls of neighboring noncoding regions, suggesting that core promoters are subject to very weak selective constraints. Interestingly, we identified 24 core promoters (at false discovery rate = 50%) that have evolved at an accelerated rate compared with the neutral controls, suggesting that they may have undergone positive selection. The inferred positively selected genes show strong bias in molecular function. We also used population genetic approaches to examine the evolution of core promoters in human populations and found evidence of positive selection at some loci.

a2ee00bf0ff3aef166b2b474a9ad9d6707fcab62,The glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor AMP-DNM induces SREBP regulated gene expression and cholesterol synthesis in HepG 2 cells,"Objectives and background Recent fi ndings have implicated glycosphingolipids as modulators of insulin receptor activity. Studies with C57BL/6J ob/ob mice have shown that insulin sensitivity is enhanced by the synthetic hydrophobic iminosugar AMP-DNM (N-(5-adamantane1-yl-methoxy-pentyl)-deoxynojirimycin) that inhibits glucosylceramide synthase. Results Here we treated the liver hepatoma cell line HepG2 with AMP-DNM, resulting in a 70% reduction of glycosphingolipids, and we analyzed the effect on gene expression. Using whole human genome 44K oligonucleotide arrays, we identifi ed 89 genes that were signifi cantly (p<0.01) upor down regulated by AMP-DNM treated treatment. Of the 56 up-regulated genes, 17 were direct target genes for transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) or SREBP2, which activate genes in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. An increase in cholesterol production rate confi rmed that the induction of SREBP target genes seen at the mRNA level resulted in activation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. It is interesting to note that the cholesterol content of the cells did not increase. It is noteworthy that no effects were found on expression of genes related to cell receptor signaling pathways, neither on toxicity or cell growth. Conclusion Our fi ndings indicate that inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase with AMP-DNM leads to activation of SREBP target genes and synthesis of cholesterol in HepG2 cells. 111 C hpter 6 Introduction It has become increasingly clear that the lipid composition of cell membranes and especially of lipid rafts plays a major role in cell signaling processes. Lipid rafts or detergent-resistant membranes are specialized domains of cell membranes enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) (Lahiri and Futerman, 2007). The signaling capacity of various receptors such as the insulin receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor that reside in these lipid rafts can be infl uenced by changing the glycosphingolipid composition of these membrane domains (Rebbaa et al., 1996; Kabayama et al., 2005; Inokuchi, 2006). This process was fi rst described by Bremer et al. (1986) who showed that epidermal growth factor-mediated signaling is inhibited by the ganglioside sialocyllactosylceramide (GM3). Furthermore, addition of GM3 to adipocytes in culture suppresses phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, resulting in reduced glucose uptake (Tagami et al., 2002). This could have important physiological consequences because glycosphingolipids have indeed been shown to accumulate in tissues from insulin-resistant rodents and humans (Summers and Nelson, 2005). Moreover, GM3 synthase-defi cient mice are protected from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance (Yamashita et al., 2003). Thus, either blocking GM3 synthase or inhibiting the synthesis of excess glycosphingolipids could improve insulin signaling in vivo. We have described previously that N-(5-adamantane-1-ylmethoxypentyl)-deoxynojirimycin (AMP-DNM), an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, specifi cally lowers glycosphingolipid levels without affecting ceramide levels in various cell models (Overkleeft et al., 1998; Aerts et al., 2003; Wennekes et al., 2007). AMP-DNM was found to reverse insulin resistance and normalize blood glucose levels in animal models of diabetes and obesity (Zucker fa/fa rats, diet-induced obese mice, and ob/ob mice). The compound also ameliorated lipotoxicity in kidney and pancreas (Aerts et al., 2007). Although these effects can be ascribed to improved insulin receptor function via modulation of glycosphingolipid levels by AMP-DNM, the question remains whether this is the only effect of AMP-DNM in vivo. Glycosphingolipids are associated with a wide range of functions, ranging from mediation of cell adhesion to modulation of signal transduction (Lahiri and Futerman, 2007). To be able to begin to understand the effects of AMP-DNM in vivo, where various hormones and organs are involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis, we set out to investigate the effects of established low glycosphingolipids at the cellular level in vitro. The liver is one of the major players in the physiology of diabetes and obesity, due to its gluconeogenic capacity and its role in lipoprotein metabolism. We monitored 112 the effect of AMP-DNM on total gene expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells using genome wide microarray analysis. We found that treatment of HepG2 cells with AMP-DNM results in 70% reduction of glycosphingolipid content without an effect on expression of genes related to cell receptor signaling pathways, toxicity, or cell growth. However, we did observe a specifi c activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) target genes, associated with the synthesis of lipids and cholesterol. Materials and Methods HepG2 Cell Culture. The human hepatic cell line HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbeccoâ€™s modifi ed Eagleâ€™s medium/ Hamâ€™s nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/HAMF-12) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% FCS at 10% CO2. For each experiment, cells were seeded in either 75or 25-cm2 tissue culture fl asks or tissue culture plates as indicated and grown to 60 to 70% confl uence. Cells were incubated in DMEM/HAMF-12 with 10Î¼M AMP-DNM in 0.01% DMSO, or vehicle only. Incubation of control and AMPDNM-treated cells was continued for 0, 24, 48, or 72 h. AMP-DNM was synthesized as described previously (Overkleeft et al., 1998). Lipid Measurements Ceramide and neutral lipids levels were determined exactly as described previously (Groener et al., 2007). In short, cells were washed three times in PBS, lysed in 500Î¼l of water, and further disrupted by sonication (three strokes) on ice. Lipids were extracted with 2 ml of chloroform/methanol [1:1 (v/v)] according to Folch et al. (1957) followed by deacylation in 500 Î¼l of 0.1M NaOH in methanol using a microwave oven (CEM microwave Solids/Moisture System SAM-155; CEM, Matthews, NC). The deacylated lipids were derivatized for 30 min with the addition of 25 Î¼l of O-phtaldehyde reagent to 50 Î¼l of lipid mixture and separated with a highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Gangliosides were detected as described recently (Ghauharali-van der Vlugt et al., 2008) by analysis of the acidic glycolipid fraction obtained by the Folch extraction. In short, the upper phase was desalted on a C18 Sep-Pak (Bakerbond) column, and the eluted gangliosides were digested with ceramide glycanase. The released oligosaccharides were labeled at their reducing end with the fl uorescent compound anthranilic acid (2-aminobenzoic 113 C hpter 6 acid), before analysis using normal-phase HPLC. For total cholesterol and cholesterol-ester determination, cells were washed in PBS, lysed in 500 Î¼l of 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and further disrupted by sonication. Cholesterol content in these samples was measured using the cholesterol oxidase reaction coupled to fl uorometric determination of hydrogen peroxide as described previously (Elferink et al., 1998). Microarray Expression Profi ling and Pathway Analysis Cells were incubated in 75-cm2 tissue culture fl asks for 48 h in either normal medium (n = 6 for reference RNA on the arrays), medium with vehicle (n=3 control samples), or medium with 10 Î¼M AMP-DNM (n = 3 treated samples). Subsequently, RNA was extracted using the TRIzol RNA isolation method (Invitrogen), followed by a purifi cation step using RNA II NucleoSpin columns, including DNase treatment (Machery Nagel, DÃ¼ren, Germany). RNA concentration and integrity were determined with a NanoDrop (Wilmington, DE) and Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. The individual samples from the control and treated cells were used for probe synthesis and hybridized on separate arrays against a probe made from a pool of reference RNA. Probe synthesis and microarray hybridizations were performed by Service XS (Leiden, The Netherlands) using a direct labeling reaction and human whole genome 44K arrays (Agilent Technologies). Processed images were imported into the Rosetta Resolver database and analysis software (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA). Statistical analysis was performed using false discovery rate-corrected p values, involving a recalculation of the p values using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Genes with a signifi cantly (p < 0.05) altered expression profi le were imported into pathway analysis software (MAPPfi nder version 2.0) and PubMed-mining software (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis version 2; Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) for further analysis. Expression-Level Analysis Quantitative gene analysis was used to confi rm differential gene expression of candidate transcripts found by microarray analysis. Total RNA (2 Î¼g) was used for fi rststrand cDNA synthesis with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). The PCR primers were designed using Primer 3 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000), and specifi city was verifi ed by conventional PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed with the MyIQ real-time detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using the SYBR Green I reaction mix (Bio-Rad). PCRs were performed in duplicate and normalized to cyclophilin and acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (36B4). 114 Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Western Blot Analysis HepG2 cells were incubated in DMEM/HAMF-12 with 10 Î¼M AMP-DNM in 0.01% DMSO, or vehicle only for 48 h in 10-cm2 tissue culture dishes. Subsequently, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. To prevent degradation of proteins, a cocktail of protease inhibitors was added to the lysis buffer (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared using a nuclear extract kit (NE-PER; Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. The protein concentration was measured with",2008,,"list(name = ""Nora Bijl"", ids = ""49747505""); list(name = ""Saskia Scheij"", ids = ""47268914""); list(name = ""Sander M.

Recently proposed mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods still have some defects such as lack of the false discovery rate (FDR) analysis for the glycan identification and lack of sufficient fragmentation information for the peptide identification. Here we proposed pGlyco, a novel pipeline for the identification of intact glycopeptides by using complementary MS techniques: 1) HCD-MS/MS followed by product-dependent CID-MS/MS was used to provide complementary fragments to identify the glycans, and a novel target-decoy method was developed to estimate the false discovery rate of the glycan identification; 2) data-dependent acquisition of MS3 for some most intense peaks of HCD-MS/MS was used to provide fragments to identify the peptide backbones. By integrating HCD-MS/MS, CID-MS/MS and MS3, intact glycopeptides could be confidently identified. With pGlyco, a standard glycoprotein mixture was analyzed in the Orbitrap Fusion, and 309 non-redundant intact glycopeptides were identified with detailed spectral information of both glycans and peptides.",2016,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Wen-Feng Zeng"", ids = ""47137506""); list(name = ""Ming-Qi Liu"", ids = ""46331886""); list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""1698138""); list(name = ""Jian-Qiang Wu"", ids = ""46365970""); list(name = ""Pan Fang"", ids = ""49208317""); list(name = ""Chao Peng"", ids = ""143913827""); list(name = ""Aiying Nie"", ids = ""48263242""); list(name = ""Guoquan Yan"", ids = ""34818652""); list(name = ""Weiqian Cao"", ids = ""33848299""); list(name = ""Chao Liu"", ids = ""145910175""); list(name = ""Hao Chi"", ids = ""47762190""); list(name = ""Rui-Xiang Sun"", ids = ""50533039""); list(name = ""Catherine C.

2f01fdfccb8e1d82ff70f6384088beea2baefd5f,Genome-Wide Association Study of Glomerular Filtration Rate in a Cohort of Sickle Cell Disease Patients,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathy is a common and devastating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) associated with mortality (Elmariah et al, 2014). However, early detection of SCD nephropathy (SCDN) has proven difficult. Discovery of genetic markers associated with SCDN could greatly improve our ability to identify patients at risk for renal decline. To that end, we have performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in our adult SCD cohort.

METHODS: Medical history, laboratory values and DNA for genotyping were collected as part of a multicenter study of outcome-modifying genes in SCD. Participating institutions included sickle cell centers at Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Emory University, and East Carolina University. GFR was estimated using the â€˜Modification of Diet in Renal Diseaseâ€™ (MDRD) study definition (Levey et al, 1999) and dichotomized at the clinically relevant threshold of 90 ml/min/1.73m2. 463 patients with complete data were included in the analysis (54.6% female, mean age 34.2 Â± 12 years, 17.5% GFR < 90 ml/min/1.73m2). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and a global reference panel from the 1000 Genomes project was used to impute genotypes not covered on the GWAS chip. Samples were pre-phased with SHAPEIT (Delaneau et al, 2012) and genotypes inferred using IMPUTE2 (Howie et al, 2009). After data cleaning and removal of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%, 3,021,990 SNPs were available for analysis. Principal component (PC) analysis was performed to obtain measures of population stratification in our data set using EIGENSOFT (Patterson et al, 2006). Logistic regression was utilized to test for association between each SNP and dichotomized GFR, controlling for genome-wide PCs using PLINK (Purcell et al, 2008). False discovery rate (FDR) p-values were generated using PROC MULTTEST in SAS (SAS Systems, Cary, NC).

RESULTS: Because GWAS chips capture common variation, several of the most highly associated SNPs were intergenic. The SNP with the most evidence for association that also lies within a gene was rs72777730 in XYLT1 (p=6.8E-6). For each additional C allele, the odds of having GFR T) was identified in XYLT1 in 6 of 7 patients with low GFR (â‰¤ 70 ml/min/1.73m2) but was absent in patients with normal GFR (> 90 ml/min/1.73m2). Additionally, four known non-synonymous SNPs were observed in low GFR patients but were absent in those with normal GFR levels.

DISCUSSION: Xylosyltransferase 1 ( XYLT1, also known as XT-1 ) encodes the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of heparin sulfate proteoglycans, which affect permeability of the glomerular basement membrane. The c.343G>T polymorphism in XYLT1 has been implicated in diabetic nephropathy (Schon et al, 2006), and XT-1 is up-regulated in rats with adriamycin nephropathy (Sichuan et al, 2007). Zinc finger protein 423 ( ZNF423 ) is involved in DNA damage response signaling, and mutations in ZNF423 have been identified in patients with nephronophthisis and Joubert syndrome (Chaki et al, 2012). Finally, solute carrier family 2 member 9 ( SLC2A9 , also known as GLUT9 ) is a transporter involved in urate reabsorption in the renal tubules. Mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with renal hypouricemia-2 (Matsuo et al, 2008). Thus, while none of the SNPs reached genome-wide significance, likely due to the modest size of our data set, we have identified several promising candidate genes nominally associated with renal function in our cohort of SCD patients and demonstrate that both common and rare variation in these genes likely contributes to risk for renal decline.

False discovery rate (FDR) methods are useful for resolving the accompanying multiple testing problems. In cDNA microarray studies, for example, p-values may be computed for each of p genes using data from n arrays, where typically p is in the thousands and n is less than 30. For FDR methods to be valid in identifying differentially expressed genes, the p-values for the nondifferentially expressed genes must simultaneously have uniform distributions marginally. While feasible for permutation p-values, this uniformity is problematic for asymptotic based p-values since the number of p-values involved goes to infinity and intuition suggests that at least some of the p-values should behave erratically. We examine this neglected issue when n is moderately large but p is almost exponentially large relative to n. We show the somewhat surprising result that, under very general dependence structures and for both mean and median tests, the p-values are simultaneously valid. A small simulation study and data analysis are used for illustration.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Michael R.

Several methods have been developed to identify genes expressed differentially between biological or clinical classes of interest. These methods use statistical approaches and are based on the assumption that between classes variations are high and within class variation is low. However, many problems in biology and biomedicine contain samples that show high levels of within class heterogeneity. This makes the identification of differentially expressed genes very challenging. To address this challenge we developed a differential expression analysis method based on a signal processing approach that uses the Earth Mover's Distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a gene's expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to estimate the false discovery rate for each gene. Applying this method to simulated and real biological data, we show that this method outperforms the conventional differential expression analysis methods.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sheida Nabavi"", ids = ""145834073""); list(name = ""Andrew H.

f306f03738d9b717a0f475ccb0d4ff514d6edda8,Comparison between titanium and anatase miRNAs regulation.,"Titanium is the gold standard among materials used for prosthetic devices because of its good mechanical and chemical properties. There are three allotropic forms of titanium dioxide: brookite, rutile, and anatase. Anatase can be prepared as a colloidal suspension and used to coat surfaces. Anatase coating (AC) can potentially have biological effects and specifically can induce bone formation. To obtain more information about the osteogenic effect of AC in comparison to to titanium we used microRNA (miRNA) microarray techniques to investigate the translation regulation in osteoblasts exposed to both titanium and AC. There were three upregulated miRNAs (mir-1, mir-34c, mir-210) and eight downregulated miRNAs (mir-23b, mir-377, mir-22, mir-93, mir-422b, mir-17-5p, mir-24, mir-130b) for false discovery rate = 0 and score >3.

2ac5e637a01b40b70003e67234afd3edd0c54095,Optimal Procedures for Multiple Testing Problems,"Multiple testing problems are a staple of modern statistical analysis. The fundamental objective of multiple testing procedures is to reject as many false null hypotheses as possible (that is, maximize some notion of power), subject to controlling an overall measure of false discovery, like family-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper we formulate multiple testing of simple hypotheses as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, seeking the most powerful rejection policy which guarantees strong control of the selected measure. In that sense, our approach is a generalization of the optimal Neyman-Pearson test for a single hypothesis. We show that for exchangeable hypotheses, for both FWER and FDR and relevant notions of power, these problems can be formulated as infinite linear programs and can in principle be solved for any number of hypotheses. We apply our results to derive explicit optimal tests for FWER or FDR control for three independent normal means. We find that the power gain over natural competitors is substantial in all settings examined. We also characterize maximin rules for complex alternatives, and demonstrate that such rules can be found in practice, leading to improved practical procedures compared to existing alternatives.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Saharon Rosset"", ids = ""1816048""); list(name = ""Ruth Heller"", ids = ""144622349""); list(name = ""Amichai Painsky"", ids = ""3092268""); list(name = ""Ehud Aharoni"", ids = ""1697314"")",ec1848721f4f524b2d96c1abe9cb1fc62e3bb1b0; 56cddfa7a7ffee22106dfbe3b7e6679470ee728f; c904acd8a43b84324889bf0f35298937adfb78cc,,arXiv: Methodology,,

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was also performed for correlations between genotypes of the identified genetic variants and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of their genes by using available databases of the 1000 Genomes, TCGA, and GTEx projects. In the single-locus logistic regression analysis, we identified 1141 out of 17â€‰532 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 112 PPAR pathway genes. Further multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent, potentially functional loci (rs12947620 in MED1, rs11079651 in PRKCA, and rs34367566 in PRKCB) for pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR]â€‰=â€‰1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.06-1.17], Pâ€‰=â€‰5.46â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 ; ORâ€‰=â€‰1.10, 95% CI, [1.04-1.15], Pâ€‰=â€‰1.99â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4 ; and ORâ€‰=â€‰1.09, 95% CI, [1.04-1.14], Pâ€‰=â€‰3.16â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4 , respectively) among 65 SNPs that passed multiple comparison correction by false discovery rate (<â€‰0.2). When risk genotypes of these three SNPs were combined, carriers with 2 to 3 unfavorable genotypes (NUGs) had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those with 0 to 1 NUGs. The eQTL analysis showed that rs34367566 A>AG was associated with decreased expression levels of PRKCB mRNA in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines.

As these individuals age, comorbid cerebrovascular disease will likely impact cognitive function. Effective tools to study this impact are needed. This study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize brain microstructural changes in HIV-infected individuals with and without cerebrovascular risk factors. Diffusion-weighted MRIs were obtained in 22 HIV-infected subjects aged 50Â years or older (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰58Â years, standard deviationâ€‰=â€‰6Â years; 19 males, three females). Tensors were calculated to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps. Statistical comparisons accounting for multiple comparisons were made between groups with and without cerebrovascular risk factors. Abnormal glucose metabolism (i.e., impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes mellitus) was associated with significantly higher MD (false discovery rate (FDR) critical p valueâ€‰=â€‰0.008) and lower FA (FDR critical p valueâ€‰=â€‰0.002) in the caudate and lower FA in the hippocampus (FDR critical p valueâ€‰=â€‰0.004). Pearson correlations were performed between DTI measures in the caudate and hippocampus and age- and education-adjusted composite scores of global cognitive function, memory, and psychomotor speed. There were no detectable correlations between the neuroimaging measures and measures of cognition. In summary, we demonstrate that brain microstructural abnormalities are associated with abnormal glucose metabolism in the caudate and hippocampus of HIV-infected individuals. Deep gray matter structures and the hippocampus may be vulnerable in subjects with comorbid abnormal glucose metabolism, but our results should be confirmed in further studies.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Beau K Nakamoto"", ids = ""40320590""); list(name = ""Neda Jahanshad"", ids = ""1721831""); list(name = ""Aaron M McMurtray"", ids = ""6162023""); list(name = ""Kalpana J Kallianpur"", ids = ""5189018""); list(name = ""Dominic C Chow"", ids = ""1979428""); list(name = ""Victor G.

640daf3899cf65a66c767c33ffa6f7f08914f672,Rescoring peptide-to-spectrum-matches based on predicted fragment ion intensities leads to an increased identification rate in metaproteomics,"The field of metaproteomics, the study of the collective proteome of whole (microbial) ecosystems, has seen substantial growth over the past few years. This growth comes from an increased awareness that metagenomics and metatranscriptomics can be powerfully supplemented by analysis of the proteins that can be found in the community, as clearly illustrated by e.g. the Integrative Human Microbiome Project. Despite its high relevance, the field still suffers from low identification rates in comparison to single-species proteomics. The underlying challenge here, is a lack of sequence resolution and statistical validation in the current identification algorithms, which are typically designed for single-species proteomics (Colaert et al. 2011, Muth et al. 2015). 
To solve this issue, we applied the recently developed, machine learning-based ReScore algorithm on several multi-species, metaproteomics datasets (Silva et al., 2019). ReScore is a post-processing tool that re-evaluates peptide-to-spectrum-matches (PSMs) based on predicted fragment ion peak intensities. To achieve this, ReScore combines two, well-established machine learning-based algorithms: Percolator, which re-scores PSMs based on the search engine output (Kall et al., 2007), and MS2PIP, which predicts fragment ion peak intensities given a peptideâ€™s sequence, charge and modifications (Degroeve et al., 2013). In the ReScore algorithm, the search engine-dependent features of Percolator are replaced with intensity features of MS2PIP. When ReScore is applied on metaproteomics datasets, it performs similar to Percolator. However, when both feature sets from Percolator and MS2PIP are combined, a significant improvement can be achieved. 
When the updated ReScore algorithm is applied on metaproteomics datasets, our results show that ReScore leads to an increased identification rate, ranging from the number of PSMs to the taxonomical level, while the false discovery rate (FDR) remains under full control as validated in an entrapment experiment with Pyrococcus furiosus (Vaudel et al., 2012).",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tim Van Den Bossche"", ids = ""119761183""); list(name = ""Ana Silvia C.

03af351ae74cf87c2aafa96cb69358523412ab30,Measurement of speech parameters in casual speech of dementia patients,"Measurement of speech parameters in casual speech of dementia patients Roelant Adriaan Ossewaarde1,2, Roel Jonkers1, Fedor Jalvingh1,3, Roelien Bastiaanse1 1CLCG, University of Groningen (NL); 2HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (NL); 33St. Marienhospital - Vechta, Geriatric Clinic Vechta (DE); r.a.ossewaarde@rug.nl Introduction Individuals with dementia often experience a decline in their ability to use language. Language problems have been reported in individuals with dementia caused by Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease or degeneration of the fronto-temporal area. Acoustic properties are relatively easy to measure with software, which promises a cost-effective way to analyze larger discourses. We study the usefulness of acoustic features to distinguish the speech of German-speaking controls and patients with dementia caused by (a) Alzheimerâ€™s disease, (b) Parkinsonâ€™s disease or (c) PPA/FTD. Previous studies have shown that each of these types affects speech parameters such as prosody, voice quality and fluency (Schulz 2002; Ma, Whitehill, and Cheung 2010; Rusz et al. 2016; Kato et al. 2013; Peintner et al. 2008). Prior work on the characteristics of the speech of individuals with dementia is usually based on samples from clinical tests, such as the Western Aphasia Battery or the Wechsler Logical Memory task. Spontaneous day-to-day speech may be different, because participants may show less of their vocal abilities in casual speech than in specifically designed test scenarios. It is unclear to what extent the previously reported speech characteristics are still detectable in casual conversations by software. The research question in this study is: how useful for classification are acoustic properties measured in spontaneous speech. MethodsParticipant recruitment and data The speech data used in this study was collected during a larger study of processing of verbs and nouns in speakers with different types of dementia, currently performed by one of the co-authors (FJ). Participant recruitment, data elicitation and manual CLAN-annotation were performed in the context of that study. Spontaneous speech fragments were elicited from German controls (n=7) and patients with a clinical diagnosis of a form of dementia: (probable) Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD, n=9), PPA (n=3), bvFTD (n=4), Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD, n=6), PD with MCI (n=4), PD with dementia (n=3). In this study, only data on controls and participants diagnosed with PPA, AD or PD are reported. For each participant, discourses on three different topics (past, present, future) were elicited. Because the ultimate goal of the larger study is to track the long-time decline of the linguistic system in non-controls, the elicitation of the three topics was repeated three times with non-controls, with about 6 months between each elicitation session. Narrative sampling The interviewer asked participants in separate sessions to speak of childhood memories (topic: past), of a typical day in the present (topic: present), and of plans that they might have for the next week, month or year (topic: future). Elicitation was done in the participantâ€™s own environment. This affects recording quality: background noises are present in the signal, such as children playing, telephones ringing and papers being shuffled. Segments of the interviewer giving instructions or asking questions were removed, but only if they are of significant length and truly interrupt the flow of the discourse of the participant. This was judged by the researcher (RO). The resulting discourses (Î¼=6m47s; Ïƒ=3m30s) are of sufficient length that minor utterances by the interviewer to move the discourse along (hmm-hmm, oh yeah, etc.) do not significantly impact the data analysis of the speakerâ€™s voice characteristics. Acoustic feature extraction Audio recordings were analyzed for voice activity using an unsupervised learning framework (Ying et al. 2011), and for pitch using an automatic pitch extraction algorithm implemented in REAPER[1]. Results of the analyses were stored in a database and then read in by R-scripts for further statistical analysis. Reaperâ€™s output (in Hz) was translated to pitch interval (in cents, P0) as proposed by Matteson, Olness, & Caplow (2013). The following variables were used for analysis: FluencyPause lengthPause frequencyPhonationDuration of speechVoice qualityJitterShimmerProsodyPitch levelmean, median, maximum and minimum P0Pitch rangeSDFour standard deviations around the mean (SD4)Max-min P0The difference between the 95th and the 5th percentile (HDI, 90% span)The difference between the 16th and the 84th percentile (HDI 68% span)Skewness and kurtosis Machine learning We trained a generalized linear multilevel model using R and Stan (McElreath, 2016; R Core Team, 2017) and evaluated its performance. Evaluation was conducted using five-fold cross-validation over the set of fragments. In each of the five folds, the parameters of the model were first learned in a training phase using 80% of the data, and then applied to the held-out data to predict the participantâ€™s diagnosis. This procedure is repeated for each of the five folds, with accuracy being the average performance on the test data across all folds. Results Results are compared to a baseline (â€œZero Ruleâ€) strategy that always predicts the majority class. The classifier is considered informative if it performs better than the baseline strategy. Machine learning results suggest that the proposed model is superior to the baseline standard of predicting the majority class, measured as the area under curve (AUROC), cf. figure 1. Individual univariate Wilcoxon rank sum tests, adapted with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995), show that SD patients have significantly shorter pauses than controls, and PD patients have significantly lower values for voice quality parameters than controls. Discussion Post-hoc analyses show that most influence in the model comes from fluency and voice quality variables, while prosody variables contribute the least. Monopitch has frequently been associated with dementia speech, but the role of pitch is very limited in the model for this convenience sample. A possible explanation is that casual spontaneous speech invites less pitch variation, both in controls and in patients.

021aaa275c02ed10f6f7e8ad5bca506939d3aaad,"Effect direction meta-analysis of GWAS identifies extreme, prevalent and shared pleiotropy in a large mammal","In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), variants showing consistent effect directions across populations are considered as true discoveries. We model this information in an Effect Direction MEta-analysis (EDME) to quantify pleiotropy using GWAS of 34 Cholesky-decorrelated traits in 44,000+ cattle with sequence variants. The effect-direction agreement between independent bull and cow datasets was used to quantify the false discovery rate by effect direction (FDRed) and the number of affected traits for prioritised variants. Variants with multi-trait pâ€‰<â€‰1eâ€“6 affected 1âˆ¼22 traits with an average of 10 traits. EDME assigns pleiotropic variants to each trait which informs the biology behind complex traits. New pleiotropic loci are identified, including signals from the cattle FTO locus mirroring its bystander effects on human obesity. When validated in the 1000-Bull Genome database, the prioritized pleiotropic variants consistently predicted expected phenotypic differences between dairy and beef cattle. EDME provides robust approaches to control GWAS FDR and quantify pleiotropy. Xiang et al. developed an Effect Direction Meta-analysis (EDME) approach to identify true pleiotropy. They used Cholesky-transformation to decorrelate the traits and identified many pleiotropic variants that consistently predicted phenotypic differences in cattle.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruidong Xiang"", ids = ""11940715""); list(name = ""Irene van den Berg"", ids = ""48274355""); list(name = ""Iona M Macleod"", ids = ""1850096""); list(name = ""Hans D Daetwyler"", ids = ""5690997""); list(name = ""Michael Goddard"", ids = ""143759426"")",,89c748f6c44a4e5805aafda5bb7cce2f7a5971fa; 07a14613e7a660821176cb1adc1f3c1f4e67f2b1; d69bedf3e6edb01c99bde7aed92152f962b015bb; adbab7e771cce5a766feae56a2cb26262d223230; efc4f935611045c165fa4febf9fbe68c958c99c8; deafaaeb7ea494491033f9d6d12e9e1e63ec3c2f; 599dceeed1c8178a1da7d608db803488d6a467dc; 959ece2a486b4df03c8d5ba954a170ff9776bcbc; 1d2744b83519657f5f2610698a8ddd177ced4f5c; 117e12840af966176bbc348db6edf034b0ea479c; 457abaf3b42faa2d603c6f69c5396e12e00f52e1; 99893a00cdb73b99570ef7cb5cf6c3f868107d59; dd38f1c6f5b6337c815de3a63b9e4a731050deb2; 46ba1202d22ee0e6359a0a7934a28c703fb7f497; dcc5412a2a20e9c849b026f92ccfa6f6c97eb0d7; ebbc08edf7b3950f78aae259cf9e3ae8ac59295f; 51c9b1013e004aa4a211f405773a10f57028f7e5; d1523e565592f16d006f6696ae097c00974fe866; 6bbe1664d0eb784590ef7658bdbbbaf53fa45d72; c4a71f9579395b92e4696fdf6e9003a54f6eafcf; d56ae226b933ad197d627e43857adfcaa50423d0; 65d3acecc2ac2484a7aa4d7f426b02588e4a968b; 9f949384ef1e579a7c131fd095721e8352f1e2b2; 965693a0504d02c359a9081217da240ee41ec1e4; 4b730d5e513d3e255e15bdb9111d1f83b7a8c7e7; 28a6a69125f826864770c0a1e0e6e33581deabf1; 74c6f29a05f460749f852b9589c8ea1245e53b3e; 54ec58ccaf8b33bc7593d3413e1dbd58d6c8ca18; 2a270c8df89f1ffb1f564b0b037db9339b17c9d5; 664c09970781f564e77a6d2dcaf3ae0c869ec0a4; 04856bfb2bd67f5ae0a17d314b686d8163b94c36; 30538f0b833c963604095d4fac4c967540452ae8; bf66abcd438784b4b85bec12c151b29ae9eb5bf3; 8193f9cccf0029fee1602130d54b9f641e09aac0; 6844c9aff77574b7f46a252131ec77c34b062db7; ad96b606eec7664d166d8beef93089a271f96af4; 2ecc919aaa4c8b3a526d2ddd906aae5f9255fa4a; a9cc79a5df0f7802145401b464e4bb30c23b8efa; 5c86d11e9edfdb11adad5e5168813486efd1def3; 2b709c21108f17a6945149139d0d1bf750ce1d29; 91e0bb69106b4e8620a1f4ee1d98e0046baafed4; f7b7d94d07c7893c778741fcab07e72ed21f9f57; 365ed53657d42c58fec9410dd92fe0cbae38047b; 50ef3b2a2d88a18ac735fe1aa7b64280208aac42,Communications Biology,3,

Our goal was to evaluate sperm specific proteins and microscopic sperm presence in vasal fluid at time of vasectomy reversal. METHODS: Patients undergoing vasectomy reversal were enrolled between 2015-2016. Samples were grouped into groups based on microscopic presence of sperm. Proteomic profiles were generated using liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry, and MS/MS protein spectral counts compared between individuals and treatment groups controlling for less than 5% false discovery rates (FDRs). Differential Expression was assessed using Bioconductorâ€™s edgeR package. Proteins were then matched with the human swissprot database. Samples were analyzed with regards to content of 8 known sperm specific proteins. RESULTS: We analyzed 53 vasal samples from 27 patients. A total of 1,692 unique proteins were detected. The presence of sperm specific proteins varied regardless of the microscopic presence of sperm (Table 1). Cysteine-rich secretory protein was abundant in all samples, while Transketolase-like protein 1 and Sperm-associated antigen 11B were absent or very low counts in all samples. Thus, using the 5 remaining sperm specific proteins we were able to identify 273 unique proteins as potential sperm biomarkers; however, no potential biomarkers correlated with microscopic sperm findings. Most common GO terms included viral process, signal transduction, and innate immune response, as well as protein folding and spermatogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Cysteine-rich secretory protein was abundant in samples regardless of microscopic sperm presence, rendering this a potential biomarker. We identified many processes contributing to the variability of the proteomic profile of vasal fluid at time of vasectomy reversal to include spermatogenesis, degradation, immune and inflammatory responses. Further evaluation is needed to determine if a potential protein biomarker exists that could predict vasectomy reversal fertility outcomes that could alleviate the need for intra-operative light microscopy, aid in procedural planning and provide a counseling tool for patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hassan Ibrahim"", ids = ""15390947""); list(name = ""Moustafa A El Taieb"", ids = ""16154617""); list(name = ""Hanan M Fayed"", ids = ""34309039""); list(name = ""N.

afb3f3cb261a8e5435db365028cf27a138c6c8fb,Dissecting the metabolic pathways controlling platelet survival in vivo: are our platelets what they eat?,"T he transfusion of platelet (PLT) products in oncology and trauma has significantly increased in the past decades. To be effective, transfused PLTs must survive and function in vivo. In the past 50 years, we have learned a number of lessons on how to maintain PLT potency for transfusion, including the deferral of donors taking drugs with antiaggregant activity, storage at room temperature in semipermeable bags, and continuous horizontal agitation. These advances have allowed us to store PLTs more effectively and to ameliorate the PLT storage lesion (reviewed in Thiagarajan et al.). The analysis of survival of autologous PLTs in circulation remains the cornerstone test to define the potency of PLT products in vivo, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided guidance on the expected limits of 24-hour recovery and survival of licensed PLT products for transfusion as a direct measurement of viability and as a surrogate measurement of stored PLT quality. The factors that affect either 24-hour recovery or survival are likely to be different and to define distinct mechanisms of the PLT storage lesion. In general, our understanding of biochemical signaling pathways strongly suggests that the factors affecting stored PLT survival depend on impaired receptor and/or signaling activation, metabolic utilization of energy sources, and upstream oxidative damage of the proteins and/or lipids required to maintain the integrity of PLT cytoskeleton and/or signaling. There has been an increasing interest in defining the sources and mechanisms that control PLT viability. High variability has been observed in the survival of stored PLTs due to both processand donor-derived factors. Multiple studies have focused on the analysis of process-derived factors on PLT viability. These studies investigated the effects of type of collection and method and duration of storage. However, donor-derived factors and the mechanisms which affect PLT viability remain a â€œblack box.â€ This problem is so important that some investigators have advocated the use of donor-independent PLT sources instead based on the use of stem cellâ€“derived methods. However, the huge expense and multiple biologic and technical issues involved remain major obstacles to the application of emergent cell engineering technologies for the manufacture of PLTs. Unveiling the donor-derived factors and/ or the mechanisms affecting PLT viability and function would potentially allow the establishment of refined, rational criteria for PLT donor selection and result in highly effective products at a reasonable cost. To obtain a true evaluation of the quality of PLTs in vivo, the late Dr Scott Murphy proposed that stored PLT products should be compared with a control of freshly prepared PLTs. These comparative studies require that the control and test PLTs be transfused simultaneously using two different markers. While decreases in 24-hour recovery may be secondary to severe damage to the PLTs resulting in increased early phagocytosis and destruction, impaired survival suggests a more subtle biochemical or membrane or cytoskeletal damage, which is not readily recognized by the host. Murphy also proposed objective standards for PLT products, namely, that the mean recovery be more than twothirds of fresh and that survival be greater than one-half of fresh. The actual requirements are still under discussion and have been modified by the FDA but the principle itself seems to be generally accepted. In this issue of TRANSFUSION, Zimring and collaborators report the use of a systematic, sequential approach to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to identify 1136 distinct biochemical intermediates, with the intent of identifying the metabolic pathways that correlate with changes in 24-hour recovery and/or survival as assessed by autologous transfusion of radiolabeled PLTs with coinfusion of â€œfreshâ€ control autologous PLTs. The study analyzed 21 single donorâ€“derived PLT products from different healthy subjects donating in one center. All subjects donated following AABB and FDA guidelines and refrained from taking antiaggregant drugs. The distinct analysis of 24-hour recovery and survival is important since each variable is expected to be sensitive to a different type of storage lesion. To reach their goal, Zimring and colleagues used longitudinal, high-resolution metabolomics analysis of PLTs stored in 100% plasma, 24-hour recovery, and survival analyses after autologous transfusion of 5-day-stored radiolabeled PLTs (normalized against fresh donor-derived control whole bloodâ€“derived PLTs radiolabeled with a different radioisotope and infused concomitantly) and stringent methods to eliminate false discovery correlates, which included the serial use of three statistical criteria: alpha error, p < 0.05; false discovery rate, q < 0.30; and doi:10.1111/trf.13684",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shailaja Hegde"", ids = ""49363471""); list(name = ""Jose A.

3119db9c09e4a9c25561cdb5c3e74b459b5dd54d,Influence of IFN-gamma on gene expression in normal human bronchial epithelial cells: modulation of IFN-gamma effects by dexamethasone.,"Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) plays a role in a variety of lung inflammatory responses, and corticosteroids are frequently employed as a treatment in these conditions. Therefore, the effect of IFN-gamma, of the corticosteroid dexamethasone (Dex), or of both on gene expression was studied in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. NHBE cells were exposed to medium alone, IFN-gamma (300 U/ml), Dex (10(-7) M), or both IFN-gamma and Dex for 8 or 24 h. Gene expression was examined using oligonucleotide microarrays. A principal components analysis demonstrated that the IFN-gamma treatment effect was the primary source of differences in the data. With a 5% false discovery rate, of the 66 genes upregulated by IFN-gamma by twofold or greater at 8 h and 287 genes upregulated at 24 h, coincubation with Dex inhibited the expression of 2 genes at 8 h and 45 genes at 24 h. Prominent among these were cytokines and secreted proteins. Dex cotreatment increased expression of 65 of the 376 genes that were inhibited by IFN-gamma by 50% at 24 h. The majority of these genes encode cell cycle or nuclear proteins. Dex alone increased the expression of only 22 genes and inhibited the expression of 7 genes compared with controls at 24 h. The effect of Dex on IFN-gamma-induced changes suggests a specific, targeted effect on IFN-gamma responses that is substantially greater than the effect of Dex alone. Dex had little effect on the immediate early response to IFN-gamma but a significant effect on the late responses.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""RafaÅ‚ Pawliczak"", ids = ""46956607""); list(name = ""Carolea Logun"", ids = ""6439375""); list(name = ""Patricia Madara"", ids = ""6374022""); list(name = ""Jennifer Joanna Barb"", ids = ""4925138""); list(name = ""Anthony F.

87a2d29e74f7125a196b0652bbf54c65346bcd39,AB0004 Characterization of Putative Pre-RA Signatures by Transcriptome Analysis,"Background Currently, the general understanding of the RA development is that the RA biological initiation precedes the clinical onset of the disease by up to several years. To identify new risk factors and pre-RA biomarkers that would detect specific disease development of pre-clinical phases and eventually predict disease onset and outcome, sampling in new large cohorts of asymptomatic individuals was initiated. Characterization of such individuals at high risk of developing RA will provide helpful strategies for early preventive treatment of RA. Objectives Benefiting of such a cohort collected in Switzerland, we aimed to characterize whole expression profile using blood samples from healthy first degree relatives of RA. A differential expression study was performed after stratification regarding clinical symptoms onset during follow-up. Methods Whole transcriptome analysis was performed with Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip using RNAs extracted from blood samples of 69 healthy first degree RA relatives. During the follow-up, 15 out of 69 became symptomatic with at least one swollen or tender joint. After differential expression analysis, bioinformatics tools were used to identify pathways and/or biological process enrichment. Results Controlling the false discovery rate at 0.5 level to optimize detection of putative signatures, we identified a list of 201 differentially expressed genes. Several pathways and biological process have been highlighted through this gene list. Conclusions This preliminary study provides candidate gene expression signatures which could be relevant for the development of RA. These candidate signatures have to be tested for their RA predictive value in a new sample set from first degree RA relatives from a French similar cohort and molecular validation of genes differentially expressed has to be performed. Follow-up of individuals will allow stratification of symptomatic relatives considering rheumatoid arthritis development, to refine expression signatures.

a7e4e2cc0c22e8b455abe0efbc35c2da738c0cca,Association between prostaglandin E receptor 3 polymorphisms and Stevens-Johnson syndrome identified by means of a genome-wide association study.,"BACKGROUND
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and its severe variant, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are acute inflammatory vesiculobullous reactions of the skin and mucosa. They often affect the ocular surface and can result in permanent visual dysfunction.


OBJECTIVES
We sought to discover genetic markers for SJS/TEN susceptibility.


METHODS
We performed a genome-wide association study with 60 patients and 300 control subjects. We applied stringent filter and visual assessments for selecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a high false discovery rate threshold. We fine-mapped the region where a candidate SNP was found and confirmed the results by means of sequencing. We evaluated the function of agonist-activated prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3), the gene for which contained several SNPs, in regulating cytokine production in human conjunctival epithelial (CE) cells. The expression levels of EP3 in the CE cells from patients and control subjects were also compared.


RESULTS
We identified 3 SNPs that passed the false discovery rate threshold. One (rs17131450) was close to the EP3 gene. Therefore we analyzed the EP3 region in detail and identified 5 other SNPs. We confirmed the association between SJS/TEN and all 6 SNPs. Activated EP3 was expressed in control CE cells, and it suppressed polyI:C-stimulated cytokine production, suggesting that EP3 might help prevent ocular surface inflammation.

The specificity for distinguishing full-siblings was no less than 99.99% under a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0 when at least 57 out of the 60 STRs were used. The specificity for distinguishing half-siblings was 99.93% under a FDR of 0 when all the markers were used.

ee4a5dfcd4b62f36a3c69f7c1c004828c0332c4f,SynQuant: an automatic tool to quantify synapses from microscopy images,"MOTIVATION
Synapses are essential to neural signal transmission. Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synaptic punctum imaging data, several issues are impeding satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness of different neurites and synaptic puncta is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio due to constraints of experiment facilities and availability of sensitive antibodies. These issues make the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to easily and accurately quantify synapses.


RESULTS
We present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. SynQuant is unsupervised, works for both 2D and 3D data, and can handle multiple staining channels. Through extensive experiments on one synthetic and three real data sets with ground truth annotation or manually labeling, SynQuant was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized unsupervised synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods.

Theoretically, it could be optimized by increasing the trade-off between vertex-wise sensitivity and specificity across several levels of smoothing. But to date neither parametric nor nonparametric methods are able to control the error at the vertex level if the null hypothesis is rejected after smoothing of cortical thickness maps. To overcome these drawbacks, we applied sequential statistical thresholding based on a simple hierarchical model. This methodology aims at controlling erroneous detections; firstly at the level of clusters, over smoothed statistical maps; and secondly at the vertex level, over unsmoothed statistical maps, by applying an adaptive false discovery rate (FDR) procedure to clusters previously detected. The superior performance of the proposed methodology over other conventional procedures was demonstrated in simulation studies. As expected, only the hierarchical method yielded a predictable false discovery proportion near the predefined FDR q-value for any smoothing level at the same time as being as sensitive as the others at the optimal setting. It was therefore the only method able to approximate the optimal size of spatial smoothing when the true change was assumed unknown. The hierarchical method was further validated in a cross-sectional study comparing moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with healthy elderly subjects. Results suggest that the extent of cortical thinning reported in previous AD studies might be artificially inflated by the choice of inadequate smoothing. In these cases, interpretation should be based on the location of local maxima of suprathreshold regions rather than on the spatial extent of the detected signal in the statistical parametric map.",2010,Medicine; Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jorge L.

60e637647dfd116db09576dbf4c7971f0549dc1b,"Correlation of serum cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and enzymes with periodontal disease parameters","BACKGROUND
Periodontal disease (PD) is characterized by inflammatory tissue destruction in tooth supporting apparatus. Many studies indicate that the underlying pathogenesis is in concordance with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sharing immune-inflammatory events affect both diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate serum cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, enzymes and costimulatory proteins in association with periodontal conditions in PD and RA subjects.


MATERIALS & METHODS
Periodontal examination was performed in RA (n = 38), PD (n = 38) and healthy subjects (n = 14). Bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD) were measured. Marginal bone loss (MBL) for premolars and molars was measured on digital panoramic radiographs. PD was defined as present if the PPD was â‰¥5mm in â‰¥ 3 different sites. Serum samples were collected from all subjects. A multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) was used to analyze the samples for simultaneous measurement of 92 cytokines. Cytokines with â‰¥ 60% quantitative results were included.


RESULTS
A significant positive correlation was seen for ST1A1, FGF-19 and NT-3 whereas EN-RAGE, DNER, CX3CL1 and TWEAK associated inversely with BOP, PPDâ‰¥ 5mm and MBL but positively with number of teeth. Several CD markers (CD244, CD40, CDCP1, LIF-R, IL-10RA, CD5 and CD6) were found to be associated with BOP, shallow and deep pockets, MBL and number of teeth, either directly or inversely. Most chemokines (CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL11, CCL4, CCL20, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CCL23) were positively associated with number of teeth and some inversely related to MBL (CCL8, CXCL10). Proteins with enzymatic activity (ST1A1, HGF and CASP-8) were directly related to the severity of periodontal conditions and inversely related to number of teeth. Aside from FGF-19, other growth factors were also directly associated with MBL (HGF), number of teeth (VEGF-A, LAP TGF-beta-1) and, inversely to, shallow pockets (LAP TGF-beta-1, TGFA and Beta-NGF). Out of 33 cytokines, 32 associated inversely with shallow pockets, whereas only CD40 associated positively. Associations between cytokines and periodontal parameters in the RA group were comparatively less.

50b2ad6be0f56fb052e85b514fb51de7672c4ef9,A fused lasso latent feature model for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data.,"Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) enables the measurement of DNA copy number across thousands of locations in a genome. The main goals of analyzing aCGH data are to identify the regions of copy number variation (CNV) and to quantify the amount of CNV. Although there are many methods for analyzing single-sample aCGH data, the analysis of multi-sample aCGH data is a relatively new area of research. Further, many of the current approaches for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data do not appropriately utilize the additional information present in the multiple samples. We propose a procedure called the Fused Lasso Latent Feature Model (FLLat) that provides a statistical framework for modeling multi-sample aCGH data and identifying regions of CNV. The procedure involves modeling each sample of aCGH data as a weighted sum of a fixed number of features. Regions of CNV are then identified through an application of the fused lasso penalty to each feature. Some simulation analyses show that FLLat outperforms single-sample methods when the simulated samples share common information. We also propose a method for estimating the false discovery rate. An analysis of an aCGH data set obtained from human breast tumors, focusing on chromosomes 8 and 17, shows that FLLat and Significance Testing of Aberrant Copy number (an alternative, existing approach) identify similar regions of CNV that are consistent with previous findings. However, through the estimated features and their corresponding weights, FLLat is further able to discern specific relationships between the samples, for example, identifying 3 distinct groups of samples based on their patterns of CNV for chromosome 17.",2011,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gen Nowak"", ids = ""29696767""); list(name = ""Trevor J.

acb82f2405ca11a3b9ac25cb4f7c6306f2f42d46,An inducible CRISPR-interference library for genetic interrogation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae biology,"Genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) is widely utilized to study cellular processes in a variety of organisms. Despite its dominance as a model eukaryote, a genome-wide CRISPRi library, optimized for targeting the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, has not been presented to date. We have generated a comprehensive, inducible CRISPRi library, based on spacer design rules optimized for yeast. We have validated this library for genome-wide interrogation of gene function across a variety of applications, including accurate discovery of haploinsufficient genes and identification of enzymatic and regulatory genes involved in adenine and arginine biosynthesis.

Consequently, the selection of suitable features is necessary as most of the raw data might be redundant or irrelevant to the recognition of patterns. In some cases, the classifier can not perform well because of the large number of redundant features. This paper presents a novel evolving feature selection algorithms taking the advantages of Bayes Theorem and Information Gain to improve the predictive accuracy.Bayes theorem is used to discover dependency information among features. In addition to that, feature selection has been improvised by Information Gain which selects features based on their importance. Different features play different roles in classifying datasets. Unwanted features will result in error information during classification which will reduce classification precision. The proposed feature selection can remove these distractions to improve classification performance. As shown in the experimental results, after feature selection using the Bayes theorem and Information gain to control false discovery rate, the classification performance of DTâ€™s and NB classifiers were significantly improved.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""S.

fdb83f219e3deacbef786e338e39305fe0d1edfa,Corrections for multiple comparisons in voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping,"ABSTRACT Voxelâ€based lesionâ€symptom mapping (VLSM) is an important method for basic and translational human neuroscience research. VLSM leverages modern neuroimaging analysis techniques to build on the classic approach of examining the relationship between location of brain damage and cognitive deficits. Testing an association between deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel involves very many individual tests and requires statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Several strategies have been adapted from analysis of functional neuroimaging data, though VLSM faces a more difficult tradeâ€off between avoiding false positives and statistical power (missing true effects). We used simulated and real deficit scores from a sample of approximately 100 individuals with left hemisphere stroke to evaluate two such permutationâ€based approaches. Using permutation to set a minimum cluster size identified a region that systematically extended well beyond the true region, making it illâ€suited to identifying brainâ€behavior relationships. In contrast, generalizing the standard permutationâ€based familyâ€wise error correction approach provided a principled way to balance false positives and false negatives. Comparison with the widelyâ€used parametric false discovery rate (FDR) correction showed that FDR produces antiâ€conservative results at smaller sample sizes (N = 30â€“60). An implementation of the continuous permutationâ€based FWER correction method described here is included in the lesymap package for lesionâ€symptom mapping (https://dorianps.github.io/LESYMAP/). HIGHLIGHTSTested multiple comparison correction strategies for lesionâ€symptom mapping.Clusterâ€based correction is particularly prone to spillâ€over beyond true regions.False discovery rate correction is antiâ€conservative at smaller sample sizes.Generalized permutationâ€based familyâ€wise error correction offers flexible control.",2018,Mathematics; Psychology; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel Mirman"", ids = ""2502755""); list(name = ""Jon-Frederick Landrigan"", ids = ""40450131""); list(name = ""Spiro Kokolis"", ids = ""4656276""); list(name = ""Sean Verillo"", ids = ""4529057""); list(name = ""Dorian Pustina"", ids = ""3698765"")",cc211a6ff3c1d6fe1df60d5db1bf03746755d29b; ec13beb1309608c106368538a6f07b53e2c336a1; 5007d80dc2de27686474fc2149a2831cbfa24f30; beb6c24f87da2783416f99bb5e55ab6d1e684ea9; a1c07d5aa4e5da6f40b015e2a1ea197ca3023ec0; 2e4c4e08df08bf135603451d2f783e42faafd6aa; e7150119172dc33feee8fa97fcae5480d2fb993b; 043768055b04f344945b6d7c80a3d4f6b6a64de0; 7c1af1b0857f0655ec48ede54d0ed43243bb7822; 3e3beed189b0be8ad69da82bc119f0ae660c73b1; 096b544d15c1c4be2fd8ef26b90b31b5f393f2ac; 63d2095c757d148fbfc1ad0f0c42d4b00721ba4c; ada737378fb93f8af075f51e857e87f18272c324; 0798fa445aeccb834241c0af282f7f309ee2959f; ed076f8ca34eb50af7013fcb96e2e41c454b8743; 975363ebcae389a7a21aa67215613247b6b5dc17; dd29fcd8604e3986a00a61238fe28c3bc88078c0; 41da74d0bcb6ef62a99ff5a829b877443c6b749c,81c609ed0e30df3f1855510f39fde73d4df4fc59; 8bfedec4b58a5339c7bd96e367a2ed3662996c84; 099ce55fe21fbe203b1c3148bd345b644219fcc3; 0943d78c23b7f2fc6f6249fdca78c21636a07987; aefe0a391ddc376ceba0b69877ad4e5ce7f9f817; de0cda66b33f6a0f25e5ea123b761c1700eee95a; e7b85db89d5f2311b2e53dcac457cd8d27d20a83; f447acefe38f48e7c61f0c4d0ebef66dd43cbc14; 49bda01e28f3f9fffa4fa14bd909c0a2340aa066; d6f3e30d80063a83a3c2b797277ff689d0c651c7; f26599ed5efab3a9d2b2c1a850bcf263229b0514; 3702e9eb44827d276fc9032f6a6d874237e3f8e6; 5fad4dda852c56b0cda4594dfa6e5825e789094d; 5fa9e3c4b6b58c3bf2ca13188c2df176040a1118; 9feaa0a8687a04ee49b2b1302f1136073606ffa6; 961f2133c495cad2ee9cde1e60cd6a8ab20517cc; a903a958b1365e71d05359da8ba265af230adc75; fc264e230970f3eed9d17a3def70863526b0b1bc; 28bb2f7e81e1088dde415a31426da7a01f051325; 5618cd47f174c19f0f738fe947696d39cc3b114a; 14cfe0efa06d36fc610bf5a5235840aea248e024; bc690f553f329b497307f309738c6671ce25e733; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b,Neuropsychologia,115,112-123

Hence, there may be some confusion about how effective this approach is and how broadly it can be applied.

5156a28701d499cd176d869971425adb25f12a17,Expression and prognostic significance of a comprehensive epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene set in renal cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition enhances tumor cell motility and has a critical role in invasion and metastasis in a number of carcinomas. A set of transcription factors acts as a master regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. To our knowledge it is unknown whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition is important for clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed mRNA levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated genes in renal cell carcinoma as well as their prognostic relevance.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We determined the expression of a set of 46 epithelial-mesenchymal transition related genes by oligonucleotide microarray and gene set enrichment analyses using RNA from 14 samples each of normal kidneys, and G1 and G3 primary renal cell carcinomas. Expression of select epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes was validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in normal kidneys, primary renal cell carcinomas and metastases in an independent cohort of 112 patients. Results were combined with followup data for survival analysis.


RESULTS
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene set was preferentially expressed in primary renal cell carcinoma compared to normal tissue (false discovery rate 0.01). No difference was found between G1 and G3 tumors. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed down-regulation of critical epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes such as CDH2 and ZEB1 in metastases, suggesting epithelial-mesenchymal transition reversal during metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a better outcome in patients with low CXCR4, vimentin, fibronectin and TWIST1 mRNA levels. Multivariate analyses revealed that CXCR4 and VIM up-regulation represents an independent prognostic marker for poor cancer specific survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma.


CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that epithelial-mesenchymal transition occurs in renal cell carcinoma. Thus, interference with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal cell carcinoma might represent a future therapeutic option.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dong Chen"", ids = ""49025727""); list(name = ""Maximilian Gassenmaier"", ids = ""47950828""); list(name = ""Matthias Maruschke"", ids = ""34859120""); list(name = ""Rainer Dr Riesenberg"", ids = ""3709377""); list(name = ""Heike Pohla"", ids = ""6194236""); list(name = ""Christian G Stief"", ids = ""33345323""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Zimmermann"", ids = ""144741248""); list(name = ""Alexander Buchner"", ids = ""49816652"")",429b5ad8923fd2f268052b7919599d1492321f1a; 0c0250ea7e3ae79a7d4fa878f190e599836b3f2f; c80b7d3fb8576f740e003ebf20fb2088f3a3f988; 08113be73f1da7f961f817269940362bc3511a98; aa53def3d71b13ed8a13db506e73800bfa23ddf1; d7a3781043db2cbd083d61e053b466d3e6f23657; b61ddecf9aee4bc5e891dadc94f55b9c2c015b40; 3924729c1cbc22e606f15c001b7cd0fc6f6ed4f2; f4d63a2b8cb0391a6989e4dff8d86a3dafc28fb9; e7b7c93e983e9a9e1d78527d9de1bf089a3ae5e4; dca0626cfdc8b7dc4435e5236d130e07d0b21cc3; 0a15c64468a15b37402f02ce9ecc2aa0bef88aaf; d521e39b5236075f706e1cb69486850cffc7b216; 1c29744ae864a58fece3e7d44ebd0c41b1e6d966; 68908cef540ccfe228ee389f40999aca8e205269; a57a4f3bfef4ae119cf960e865ca335b39e62add; 43506260894023c2a39fe542a0dea44df987510c; 2e21c1f97de9237edd9c18c851656a0d9f543a38; ea44d663fc9316beef994b56788df3a7fa5af989; 84dd53136912f393b7c40788fc9a693107ca8c68; 677a832b1a92838ea06ac87de89b2a7f9be0ca0d; c84fc1655d812a3cbd8ff00eed9c92308210a585; 2410b81ce6d2d95f9af96949dee9de3d512e46ad; d33499356040baeabd31c35dc6ec71b3f3c1c968; 11d8ddc3c83d21ab11af41d5efd5ade41bcf631b; 4f55731587794649b5c0cd29dc5ade0a8d624f00,500afc5ca49e67bbb1a6e79ac0501b5cbf09c184; d6eaaaf1b873be4a27d88a941bff8d3fb6f265ba; e2bd9e1bc8fa6c8c41fe5aa77917136f43116117; 8dba191737bfd934302aa802e6f56c22bf2e5aaf; e83129d9722eae6092ff078fd71142cc59343fa6; d3633eeb1176ce719c6b660ff7bfd297ae120b2c; b2aefb37e4b6a8da8c2d24d35dc8afd82b593a1c; 430b8192e3cd0f057545cb523d3a9268aad7484d; 4aaa8ee46ecd5d8689ec32780720fcb156b20dc3; 028139f6b7f677d2fea3579b7bc274d7d17bac5f; 9287aa8f9f54e43bbd99bd19ebf89a46bcc43069; d9b1bc934236ceb413b65a833c97eaa40ad6b113,The Journal of urology,191 2,"

20646a2f25bf31cf20025dc27f7b7cb67513237e,A hybrid approach to protein differential expression in mass spectrometry-based proteomics,"MOTIVATION
Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics involves statistical inference on protein abundance, based on the intensities of each protein's associated spectral peaks. However, typical MS-based proteomics datasets have substantial proportions of missing observations, due at least in part to censoring of low intensities. This complicates intensity-based differential expression analysis.


RESULTS
We outline a statistical method for protein differential expression, based on a simple Binomial likelihood. By modeling peak intensities as binary, in terms of 'presence/absence,' we enable the selection of proteins not typically amenable to quantitative analysis; e.g. 'one-state' proteins that are present in one condition but absent in another. In addition, we present an analysis protocol that combines quantitative and presence/absence analysis of a given dataset in a principled way, resulting in a single list of selected proteins with a single-associated false discovery rate.

c84b312e28a3048492b05d1e8538171b584be402,A translational approach from an animal model identifies CD80 as a candidate gene for the study of bone phenotypes in postmenopausal women,"SummaryThis study represented a translational study that first compared gene expression of B cells of BM from ovariectomized and control mice, and then analyzed some of the differentially expressed genes in women. Results showed novel genetic associations with bone phenotypes and points to the CD80 gene as relevant in postmenopausal bone loss.IntroductionOsteoporosis is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. However, to date, research into osteoporosis has only been able to explain a small part of its heritability. Moreover, several components of the immune system are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism. Among them, B cells occupy a prominent place.MethodsThe study consisted of two stages. In the first, gene expression in bone marrow B cells is compared between ovariectomized and SHAM control mice using microarrays. In the second, we studied the association of polymorphisms in some differentially expressed genes (DEG) in a cohort of postmenopausal women.ResultsThe present study has found 2791 DEG (false discovery rate (FDR) <5%), of which 1569 genes were upregulated (56.2%) and 1122 genes (43.8%) were downregulated. Among the most altered pathways were inflammation, interleukin signaling, B cell activation, TGF-beta signaling, oxidative stress response, and Wnt-signaling. Sixteen DEG were validated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or qPCR. The translational stage of the study genotyped nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DEG or related and detected association with bone mineral density (BMD) (nominal P values), while adjusting for confounders, for SNPs in the CD80, CD86, and HDAC5 genes. In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders, in addition to the SNPs in the aforementioned genes, the SNPs in the MMP9 and SOX4 genes were associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. Finally, two SNPs (in the CD80 and SOX6 genes) were associated with an increased risk of bone fragility fracture (FF). However, after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only the association between CD80 with BMD and risk of osteoporosis remained significant.ConclusionThese results show that the use of animal models is an appropriate method for identifying genes associated with human bone phenotypes.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Layla Panach"", ids = ""6556953""); list(name = ""Eva Serna"", ids = ""153870926""); list(name = ""Juan J.

770341047be3e57d8a44838d2b200814b40c14b2,Altered gene expression in murine placentas in an infection-induced intrauterine growth restriction model: a microarray analysis.,"The biological mechanisms leading to incomplete intrauterine growth are not completely elucidated and few studies have investigated infection-mediated growth restriction. In this investigation we report the alterations induced by maternal infectious challenge in placental gene expression patterns using a murine model. Pregnant dams were challenged at day E7.5 with the oral human pathogen Campylobacter rectus to elicit fetal growth restriction. At embryonic day E16.5 placentas were collected to compare placental gene expression patterns from normal fetuses of unchallenged dams and growth restricted fetuses from infected dams. Differential gene expression patterns were determined using Agilent Oligo array (G4121A) with a false discovery rate of P<0.05 and pathway analyses were performed. Seventy-four genes were differentially expressed during infection-mediated growth restriction with 9 genes significantly up-regulated, indicating that the effects of maternal infection on gene expression were predominantly suppressive. Pathway analyses indicated that 46 of the 65 genes that were significantly down-regulated were associated with placental/fetal development, and 26 of those were imprinted genes. Among the 9 genes that were up-regulated, 4 are involved in oxygen supply to the fetus and the development of the vascular system. Microarray analysis demonstrated that in the pregnant mouse model, maternal infection that induced growth restriction was associated with down-regulated placental expression of critical growth and developmental related genes, including many imprinted genes. These findings may have significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying infection-associated human fetal growth restriction and the role of differential placental expression of imprinted genes in fetal growth.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Y A Bobetsis"", ids = ""46657674""); list(name = ""S.

bb60eb1acd90cb59a92e4d15e403bdb660f85b10,Improved Measurements of RNA Structure Conservation with Generalized Centroid Estimators,"Identification of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in genomes is a crucial task for not only molecular cell biology but also bioinformatics. Secondary structures of ncRNAs are employed as a key feature of ncRNA analysis since biological functions of ncRNAs are deeply related to their secondary structures. Although the minimum free energy (MFE) structure of an RNA sequence is regarded as the most stable structure, MFE alone could not be an appropriate measure for identifying ncRNAs since the free energy is heavily biased by the nucleotide composition. Therefore, instead of MFE itself, several alternative measures for identifying ncRNAs have been proposed such as the structure conservation index (SCI) and the base pair distance (BPD), both of which employ MFE structures. However, these measurements are unfortunately not suitable for identifying ncRNAs in some cases including the genome-wide search and incur high false discovery rate. In this study, we propose improved measurements based on SCI and BPD, applying generalized centroid estimators to incorporate the robustness against low quality multiple alignments. Our experiments show that our proposed methods achieve higher accuracy than the original SCI and BPD for not only human-curated structural alignments but also low quality alignments produced by CLUSTAL W. Furthermore, the centroid-based SCI on CLUSTAL W alignments is more accurate than or comparable with that of the original SCI on structural alignments generated with RAF, a high quality structural aligner, for which twofold expensive computational time is required on average. We conclude that our methods are more suitable for genome-wide alignments which are of low quality from the point of view on secondary structures than the original SCI and BPD.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yohei Okada"", ids = ""49472046""); list(name = ""Yutaka Saito"", ids = ""48558417""); list(name = ""Kengo Sato"", ids = ""51311844""); list(name = ""Yasubumi Sakakibara"", ids = ""1705051"")",bb60eb1acd90cb59a92e4d15e403bdb660f85b10; 7d99b00b8e29565d4570b92ae4a4ab31fe75e06e,d387847494decc85c5c907f959cb0803250296c3; 847eab3db971b86aa434f2a60ffeef7317be5d42; 7ce8d1231c8c00ddc36de23aaf4cf1225a130f3e; 548ad22350ef9824fa77819e9febf16840494a9e; 3826023d5503013abdce4fb7356f78cf58af9ba2; bb60eb1acd90cb59a92e4d15e403bdb660f85b10; c8f1d738b591197da0dbd55cf1ff9afdda047b64; eb19613f0c868b45a7cfe601c0e85f1e79351ce0; fe695f4d5b85057198eef0d7b32b714751da6e55; dc5a592cbbf92008ee5a565de9164c94de2fdde3; 22ffd3d59d256c3255cfb8c29279671fc43f8ac4; d5b78078c432369f8ff4de5b3e6eafdc08d7a173; f44e4fe385aefeb1e655253853f04f89d5acfec4; 79d550cde428d9d5993f56f871f4df6606befe24; 44657fb55d5ba3740e809ef34d522a659f5df605; d90e7f55955c15c05ba9c59bb709540f577ef2cf; e37092e3694e893fd000c974c899a4acaa1dd522; 4c5ffc038b5550c02e62cc24433e83732c54e2fd; 7763e0d8b97dc5e67857a284306cb7e6338b2d29; 3c343a6dbca2b24d19268b625099f79c43100992; 06cc0bdf3dbe142b53610196fbfb171e47e69bed; 4f7d1e04c9d30ce12df3e085d10d70997e6ea1a5; 664803cda3f5f42a351690855e0821a0e46cea7f; c4b8511f44412b9d4de281dc471255686b07a95c; f926047141eabe82841a545e3381a369f7ba7436; 5ad7200ccd6236a8e7b8cb811fee143bde0ab4e7; d28203f6bdcaecea0fbd5f128b830e4cf8c4259b; 7808346796905df36ac43339d949880d9c034e91; ce6d075db385aa006555fbd16cc7878529ec2c1a; 9000a6e54edca30f333af9f0c7e5856fbf2aa328; 14b62a7e71b2b18966b5eabccce3adba89a6d913; 7e0693d10a43d2911fc570bd3e17f872f20da037; a48b642dfc4833951abdc1bca7884a6e2d73e8cc; 0983d20b309aacbcce168c6c2f7490e254d08824; 924b3dc59f36625318fa367635e1cb15d1853b4b; 7f201defb7dc5347e36823d5b9b49c2ec71a53a0,Frontiers in Genetics,2,

Several security software vendors now offer ""data loss prevention"" (DLP) solutions that use simple algorithms, such as keyword lists and hashing, which are too coarse to capture the features what makes sensitive documents secret. In this paper, we present automatic text classification algorithms for classifying enterprise documents as either sensitive or non-sensitive. We also introduce a novel training strategy, supplement and adjust, to create a classifier that has a low false discovery rate, even when presented with documents unrelated to the enterprise.

8bda3d7a2608eae656628874e52e48bac963a5a5,Differential endothelial cell gene expression by African Americans versus Caucasian Americans: a possible contribution to health disparity in vascular disease and cancer,"BackgroundHealth disparities and the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease continue to be perplexing worldwide health challenges. This study addresses the possibility that genetic differences affecting the biology of the vascular endothelium could be a factor contributing to the increased burden of cardiovascular disease and cancer among African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasian Americans (CA).MethodsFrom self-identified, healthy, 20 to 29-year-old AA (n = 21) and CA (n = 17), we established cultures of blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) and applied microarray profiling. BOEC have never been exposed to in vivo influences, and their gene expression reflects culture conditions (meticulously controlled) and donor genetics. Significance Analysis of Microarray identified differential expression of single genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis examined expression of pre-determined gene sets that survey nine biological systems relevant to endothelial biology.ResultsAt the highly stringent threshold of False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0, 31 single genes were differentially expressed in AA. PSPH exhibited the greatest fold-change (AA > CA), but this was entirely accounted for by a homolog (PSPHL) hidden within the PSPH probe set. Among other significantly different genes were: for AA > CA, SOS1, AMFR, FGFR3; and for AA < CA, ARVCF, BIN3, EIF4B. Many more (221 transcripts for 204 genes) were differentially expressed at the less stringent threshold of FDR <.05. Using the biological systems approach, we identified shear response biology as being significantly different for AA versus CA, showing an apparent tonic increase of expression (AA > CA) for 46/157 genes within that system.ConclusionsMany of the genes implicated here have substantial roles in endothelial biology. Shear stress response, a critical regulator of endothelial function and vascular homeostasis, may be different between AA and CA. These results potentially have direct implications for the role of endothelial cells in vascular disease (hypertension, stroke) and cancer (via angiogenesis). Also, they are consistent with our over-arching hypothesis that genetic influences stemming from ancestral continent-of-origin could impact upon endothelial cell biology and thereby contribute to disparity of vascular-related disease burden among AA. The method used here could be productively employed to bridge the gap between information from structural genomics (for example, disease association) and cell function and pathophysiology.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peng Wei"", ids = ""144537874""); list(name = ""LC Milbauer"", ids = ""152623004""); list(name = ""Judy Enenstein"", ids = ""4285138""); list(name = ""Jonathan B.

We have observed that PTL strongly inhibits NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, anti-oxidants such as N-acetylcysteine block the apoptotic process. However, the molecular events involved in the process are not completely understood. Given the demonstrated efficacy of PTL at targeting AML stem cells (AML-SCs), we hypothesized that a molecular signature that captures events invoked during PTL-induced apoptosis will provide a powerful tool for improving AML-SC targeting. To this end, we have conducted pharmacogenomic studies using primary CD34-enriched cells obtained from 12 randomly selected AML specimens. To capture dynamics of the PTL response, primary CD34+ AML were cultured in vitro and exposed to 5 micromolar PTL for either 1 hour or 6 hours. Labeled mRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133plus2 chips. Differential expression of individual genes was assessed using moderated and permutation-based paired tests with false discovery rate control. Additionally, to capture pathway-level events possibly representing drugable targets, we employed functional, network, and robust geneset-based approaches to mine the data for coordinated changes in the expression of groups of biologically related genes, e.g., those controlled by a common transcription factor. By 1 hour post-treatment, we were able to detect the beginning stages of a cascade of responses leading to activation of antioxidant enzymes, cytoskeletal reorganization and downregulation of adhesion molecules, modulation of protein synthesis, proteasome remodeling, and modulation of cell cycle progression genes (q",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Duane C.

dee9a5ed0e945bfb34ecb4908f1627b454bb3738,In Silico Post Genome-Wide Association Studies Analysis of C-Reactive Protein Loci Suggests an Important Role for Interferons.,"BACKGROUND
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). An important limitation of GWASs is that the identified variants merely flag the nearby genomic region and do not necessarily provide a direct link to the biological mechanisms underlying their corresponding phenotype. Here we apply a bioinformatics-based approach to uncover the functional characteristics of the 18 SNPs that had previously been associated with CRP at a genome-wide significant level.


METHODS AND RESULTS
In the first phase of in silico sequencing, we explore the vicinity of GWAS SNPs to identify all linked variants. In the second phase of expression quantitative trait loci analysis, we attempt to identify all nearby genes whose expression levels are associated with the corresponding GWAS SNPs. These 2 phases generate several relevant genes that serve as input to the next phase of functional network analysis. Our in silico sequencing analysis using 1000 Genomes Project data identified 7 nonsynonymous SNPs, which are in moderate to high linkage disequilibrium (r(2)>0.5) with the GWAS SNPs. Our expression quantitative trait loci analysis, which was based on one of the largest single data sets of genome-wide expression probes (n>5000) identified 23 significantly associated expression probes belonging to 15 genes (false discovery rate <0.01). The final phase of functional network analysis revealed 93 significantly enriched biological processes (false discovery rate <0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
Our post-GWAS analysis of CRP GWAS SNPs confirmed the previously known overlap between CRP and lipids biology. Additionally, it suggested an important role for interferons in the metabolism of CRP.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ahmad Vaez"", ids = ""115538228""); list(name = ""Rick Jansen"", ids = ""35115924""); list(name = ""Bram P.

1afe566386fd11c88a102699451303d3c34b0723,Brain Gene Expression in a Novel Mouse Model of Postpartum Mood Disorder,"Introduction Steroid sulfatase (STS) is an enzyme which cleaves sulfate groups from a variety of steroid hormones, thereby altering their activity and solubility. The expression and activity of STS is increased in female mammalian tissues (including brain) during late pregnancy and into the postpartum period. STS-deficient human and mouse mothers (as a consequence of genetic mutation or acute pharmacological manipulation) show evidence for elevated psychopathology and abnormal behaviour respectively in the postpartum period. In mice, these behavioural effects can be partially normalised through administration of the antipsychotic ziprasidone. Methods To explore the neurobiology underlying these postpartum behavioural effects, we compared whole brain gene expression by microarray in behaviourally-defined new mouse mothers acutely administered the STS inhibitor 667-Coumate (10mg/kg p.o.) or vehicle solution (n=12 per group); significant changes were followed-up with pathway analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Finally, the effects of combined 667-Coumate and antipsychotic (ziprasidone) administration (0, 0.3 and 1.0mg/kg i.p.) on the brain expression of the most robustly differentially-expressed candidate genes was examined (nâ‰¥7 per group). Results Surprisingly, no significant gene expression changes were detected between vehicle and 667-Coumate-treated brains at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected p<0.1. 1,081 unique expression changes were detected at a less-stringent cut-off of p<0.05, just two top hits were verified by qPCR, and pathway analysis indicated a significant enrichment of genes involved in olfactory transduction (corrected p-value=1.8Ã—10âˆ’3). The expression of the two most robust differentially-expressed genes (Stoml3 and Cyp2g1) was not affected by ziprasidone administration. Conclusions Behavioural abnormalities in new mothers in the postpartum period elicited as a result of STS deficiency are likely to be the culmination of many small gene expression changes. Our data are consistent with the idea that olfactory function is key to postpartum maternal behaviour in mice, and suggest that aberrant expression of olfactory system genes may partially underlie abnormal maternal behaviour in STS-deficient women.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Trevor Humby"", ids = ""6635489""); list(name = ""William Davies"", ids = ""144974122"")",1afe566386fd11c88a102699451303d3c34b0723,42bab5d02bcae8f2efcd9a189982ada9f41ab8ef; fe29df40164210c94bcf87bba2cdec85c1c564a7; 1698987b9cc35ebbf36bd15f21ea58d4efc7435f; f32e3301d6fe173473615e008cb43cee394f21f4; 5f6bb91e522e14dadf89ae047f43bd0c00ed36e9; 87f55105eb87f3101a8bef61ccb352d06b94d593; 82ff082daa7432dd05069dbc8f02ab60cdaa234e; cde2237e2ae5773f48b978d2287d8939dc70f066; 1afe566386fd11c88a102699451303d3c34b0723; 0ce28473890eb93d76620bf5617ab80496b11d36; cac2cab6198599c354edd75db9ee95b8077e82e2; 779c133a8badb6e314bf897b769140668685015f; 85d81cb529b8d6d07a5678b94f7cc7215328d64c; 121592b1a4d5acd6ace517a5d0fbca1d6d20584c; 0977ac6e2e579c71918e66e60f8fe9d146fa2363; 8b81af7d7eab9dd6c6bafaa9856028c83cd447eb; 9c90eb658036b01087013e7739e902bd6a2742b0; 6442d9f8f018014911895d1313378b030070d3e3; 6fb3c12b8cf223bf751f89e6e14a8ef59e356e51; c611cba4fe0c4b913d7cc0b3cf5f6123307b68d2; 53286ac6002caa6b57e5765f8150ab73304b6857; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 4f51be66ad046f7099054b3793446f4002a40753; 8b1ec1469724402688a20222f868b0b87ade6f88; 5ec4339ff658fa780fe99f9e88db479906767b4b; e443ceaa9a663ebc65fb5967faa83bd9df26328d; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; 9736dce75b8628a42a3b148ea8e064a4448c63dc; e7bcfa38d572be04b25569a5a8ae09fb5a900c67; 2f30d80a7f9c231446171aa257f470218c2b4825; c942be40c67cc213487d03b63cf0b452cb94fcff; 8e5891240622705054084b193a673b861dd1c8f9; 39dff6c3dc2d5a229074e1947cc5d67723fa2c40; 8319ec3c512ef0aba17b17e3036d1f55688eac65; 916c8803d6364bce8ce7c1e1b672def1153ba726; b264fe36b2da50605906893ff442316bebd0cc28; 2e30e16aae951e377a637d1a654c3a8bb1d9a950; 0a0dbe6902ed8f2cb1784788b636eaf5c49a6fad,Translational Neuroscience,10,168 - 174
cd9d90239577d007f68d36eb583faed77b34308c,Genome-wide association study for sperm motility in pigs,"Sperm motility is the proportion of sperm cells with a straightforward movement and is one of the most widely used tests in order to evaluate boar semen quality. In this study the PorcineSNP60 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to help identifying the association between SNP markers and sperm motility in two different pig lines, through a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). After quality control, a total of 42,551 SNPs (line 1) and 40,890 SNPs (line 2) were used in GWAS. A total of 602 and 525 genotyped animals for lines 1 and 2 respectively were used to perform the GWAS, that included the polygenic effect and considered the deregressed breeding values as dependent variable in the model. A False Discovery Rate based q-value â‰¤ 0.05 was used as threshold for significant association. Six SNPs on pig chromosome 1 (SSC1 position 117,260,234119,556,999 bp) were significantly associated with the trait in line 2 and no SNPs were considered significantly associated with the trait in line 1, which can be explained by differences in linkage disequilibrium measurements between the lines. To our knowledge, this is the first time that SNP markers associated with sperm motility in pigs have been reported in this region on SSC1. The mitochondrial methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTFMT) is a possible candidate gene affecting the trait on the region. This study provides SNP markers and a candidate gene associated with the trait of interest. Therefore, replication, validation in another population and confirmation of published QTL or candidate genes related to boar sperm motility in the same region where we found in this study is necessary before using such information in selection.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Daniele Botelho Diniz"", ids = ""152410839"")",,089e2a852908de5ec0959085ba20d0eb43769249; efa337ef8838b84629a0fe37d311131a9c5ec45c; 360736f41850ead4940fa9479eee1933203f5e1d; a543347de2ab10e191a1130c04d88e012f4bca21; e08f6172b7f792d70bb69cd4aa2876703279d0ef; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; d76f602367588ecbfab0ba45b8719c4c66fb9bb5; cf41959b7fff56346b2c8e6a3d53b60677ada53a; fe4cc7d532df4a741f99879d594722e58777f695; 579080ee4d89a84f15d9792a12982bdd03403941; 6d718b70302530ffa1783054ca5de8748ccae75d; a85a3d5bbf0c652bc1305bee6e4c4c62ac635ced; 11a84b851772a3772c49ccde33601c8b02a808e1; 56e5a838db25627f59bf186482ea0d0ce1e00600,,,
9f6d9658248911b915e6d8ffa64dac37782f5b6d,Filaggrin-stratified transcriptomic analysis of pediatric skin identifies mechanistic pathways in patients with atopic dermatitis,"BACKGROUND
Atopic dermatitis (AD; eczema) is characterized by a widespread abnormality in cutaneous barrier function and propensity to inflammation. Filaggrin is a multifunctional protein and plays a key role in skin barrier formation. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) are a highly significant risk factor for atopic disease, but the molecular mechanisms leading to dermatitis remain unclear.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to interrogate tissue-specific variations in the expressed genome in the skin of children with AD and to investigate underlying pathomechanisms in atopic skin.


METHODS
We applied single-molecule direct RNA sequencing to analyze the whole transcriptome using minimal tissue samples. Uninvolved skin biopsy specimens from 26 pediatric patients with AD were compared with site-matched samples from 10 nonatopic teenage control subjects. Cases and control subjects were screened for FLG genotype to stratify the data set.


RESULTS
Two thousand four hundred thirty differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate, P < .05) were identified, of which 211 were significantly upregulated and 490 downregulated by greater than 2-fold. Gene ontology terms for ""extracellular space"" and ""defense response"" were enriched, whereas ""lipid metabolic processes"" were downregulated. The subset of FLG wild-type cases showed dysregulation of genes involved with lipid metabolism, whereas filaggrin haploinsufficiency affected global gene expression and was characterized by a type 1 interferon-mediated stress response.


CONCLUSION
These analyses demonstrate the importance of extracellular space and lipid metabolism in atopic skin pathology independent of FLG genotype, whereas an aberrant defense response is seen in subjects with FLG mutations. Genotype stratification of the large data set has facilitated functional interpretation and might guide future therapy development.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Cole"", ids = ""38748387""); list(name = ""Karin Kroboth"", ids = ""4686165""); list(name = ""Nicholas J.

887b3876ca51c050e374533ab25eb303ae352464,MRI evaluation of motor function recovery by rTMS and intensive occupational therapy and changes in the activity of motor cortex.,"Purpose/aim: An intervention that combines low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intensive occupational therapy can improve brain function in post-stroke patients with motor paralysis. The purpose of the present study is examined motor function recovery by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and intensive occupational therapy and changes in the activity of motor cortex based on magnetic resonance imaging data.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In total, we assessed 30 patients with post-stroke upper extremity paralysis who were hospitalized for 12 sessions of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the lesion-free hemisphere plus daily occupational therapy for 15 days. Imaging analysis was performed using 3-dimensional T1-weighted image and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Hemispheric dominance was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging using the laterality index. In addition, Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was used to evaluate functional connectivity between the precentral gyrus of the affected side and other areas.


RESULTS
A positive correlation was found between laterality index before intervention and the Brunnstrom recovery stage for hand/fingers (p < 0.05). The intervention resulted in significantly higher functional connectivity between the precentral gyrus of the affected side and that of the healthy side (false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
We clarified that the recovery of motor function by intervention with low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and occupational therapy and the increase of functional connectivity between the precentral gyrus on the affected side and the healthy side are related. These results facilitate prognostic predictions and evidence-based medical care.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ryo Ueda"", ids = ""47873878""); list(name = ""Naoki Yamada"", ids = ""2553462""); list(name = ""Masahiro Abo"", ids = ""3486613""); list(name = ""Wanni Arachchi Pradeepa Ruwan"", ids = ""1393169798""); list(name = ""Atsushi Senoo"", ids = ""33238444"")",,,The International journal of neuroscience,,"

21051c97247353170dafc05111dfe3c1912c9bc4,"Comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of yellow shell and black shell pearl oysters, Pinctada fucata martensii","BackgroundThe pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii (Pfu.), widely cultured in the South China Sea, is a precious source of sea pearls and calcifying materials. A yellow shell variety of Pfu. was obtained after years of artificial breeding. To identify differentially expressed genes between yellow shell and normal black shell pearl oysters, we performed transcriptomic sequencing and proteomic analyses using mantle edge tissues.ResultsA total of 56,969 unigenes were obtained from transcriptomic, of which 21,610 were annotated, including 385 annotated significant up-regulated genes and 227 significant down-regulated genes in yellow shell oysters (| log2 (fold change) | â‰¥2 and false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Tyrosine metabolism, calcium signalling pathway, phototransduction, melanogenesis pathways and rhodopsin related Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched with significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in transcriptomic. Proteomic sequencing identified 1769 proteins, of which 51 were significantly differentially expressed in yellow shell oysters. Calmodulin, N66 matrix protein, nacre protein and Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor were up-regulated in yellow shell oysters at both mRNA and protein levels, while glycine-rich protein shematrin-2, mantle gene 4, and sulphide: quinone oxidoreductase were down-regulated at two omics levels. Particularly, calmodulin, nacre protein N16.3, mantle gene 4, sulphide: quinone oxidoreductase, tyrosinase-like protein 3, cytochrome P450 3A were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Yellow shell oysters possessed higher total carotenoid content (TCC) compared than black shell oyster based on spectrophotography.ConclusionsThe yellow phenotype of pearl oysters, characterised by higher total carotenoids content, may reflect differences in retinal and rhodopsin metabolism, melanogenesis, calcium signalling pathway and biomineralisation. These results provide insights for exploring the relationships between calcium regulation, biomineralisation and yellow shell colour pigmentation.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meng Xu"", ids = ""50746399""); list(name = ""Jing Huang"", ids = ""143766908""); list(name = ""Yu Shi"", ids = ""144641847""); list(name = ""Hua Zhang"", ids = ""48213472""); list(name = ""Maoxian He"", ids = ""5270567"")",d9676bfbaaac32da852fdd3f62071f42e137eae0,65b38520c03b0f7f1d9c8f853e537f59d99ce9f0; 5cab8f4a3edda3107943f96dc1dbcdf60a5bc990; 7deeea56bc74c6d4f3be66f99fc89689aaae38cc; e0b67bd6d3cda67659709e8976506d31de453fa5; a5df7d147965f4f8dbfb530639ce5b23cb255436; 62f5ffb09a4c9543509c38f005b9c6eb308c6974; 156eb6b67af78e277a0e703143a2b91a1dea756b; 1b91b3e62ada38f861cb16d4091188d8c7b7d073; 4667ad4302254f67ef8c831ede8e4cd8d0709715; f9992a7cb8f92beb183ce0791db293e794c1f2c1; 825f8fd395d5951cb1ec493d706e1541ec159009; 471eefc3145bc01ac7f7c85fa2416793d450f139; bfa519b943ac68f31cea19659e06d24d31928cce; 7fc281e1f07fefe12e5bd0c921af1f2ae8b9aec3; 70e307b05e70e5fa36c3d2d1f4116bd5d9be9b87; 721d733f850536c3d28872fe9922e119edc0cf7f; 4580ba914fe16fae7d733b96e37a282bed953437; 0eef3c31d19d74ac69ffda31b52c4c29357c8c47; c638050b54e69479e1ac5caa94124ff73bdebb5f; ccd945a90d6528b0aeb8c1cc741f1c7dc4e36b00; cd060544f04097ee5ab4f8bcc5710a432a6ca41d; c3f7261bff7f6e2f3cc1a6c457d4c8dc66a097c5; f1213438d819cf44196464a58157c2a1495aa0b3; 06ef94cf9d4daca0aec88a3da058fc34bc4adb5b; 417eb86f1bfaab4f2f412fc36f1579cc9c5e9d68; ec9656f9b7c4047432e1a9534653410689c43c8b; 3af364c2b527024a2502f002455c54f582140ba3; b1c66b12b4b7e9e054c32855bd6d989a54fcf3c7; e790f127dd71fc9fd5ea69075aca062f3a55cc12; dc7f01616aea5d85e594d6b9d1113ca3bb292d28; 30d4350f633e2996c21aad2d453c42adff1ebd8b; 788b43b7c62b497cf69b31544c6f81c6f4856d42; b34e3cee8197c96640251c92b7ab5262a05874d6; d268326d7bc87f2a187a61367c640f7f62246e2f; 158ea782b45ebcb5ccb3b838c3da0f03522e37f9; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; dce7874e946ea03845f92700fa764fc689cf4ce2; 12531e976844e84ebc7e09fbdbad524434189fb6; cd260085755c1757c5553713aa9fe5406acac6b7; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; f84855cb8e3668fec4cdaa90f38369071a3b32dd; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 2b3e821720c4a5d2d7a7a4aea59f39afc9755dc8; 991588d8ce9d66226946cd83c98c9ba38019ebad; 10ab879d1a1ac3a8a55c7562d6813335ba09afe6; 964404598b566ba2aea0c098199901d3092496ff; 4580e48d8415754b7b08fea1908434f8f68eac3d; 4e444ec769c5baa737428deefba9c531a3ab84e1; 135a6834cbf24014cfc7483c8ba3354b0142621f; 955fe5b0eb5e9fefab7bf21dede20e1285dca410; 99918f8c73f88ee6ac1eda68da6cd40c96c5e2db; 8a8babcd688b82323b9da4f6c06a413494cc4bbb; 6bfc2e7c594bebcf69292f15b3a0c761aeac5d61; 3db0518ed0882b7731ed3c5dddbcbff302b78755; 79c6a393e79dcf396a641df7f33e571652f1a5d2; 51bf42d65a603a73bac68aa44c8a6e5e03507d69; 1923b4437b2b93745447a69721cc1830cb527dc9; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 15b638cb6ef042b8d26842e0c7af3d765d9889ca,BMC Genomics,20,

Among them, diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC) is the subtype with worst prognosis. Here we describe the first proteomic landscape of DGC. We carried out proteome profiling and targeted exome DNA sequencing of 84 DGC samples. We analyzed the 1,008 (168 x 6) raw files together for uniformed quality control and protein identification with 1% global protein false discovery rate (FDR), which resulted in the identification of 11,340 gene products (GPs).

16d9d7ed6db7a109feeae0952d586047ca6b10e5,Metabolomics Reveals Broad-Scale Metabolic Perturbations in Hyperglycemic Mothers During Pregnancy,"OBJECTIVE To characterize metabolites across the range of maternal glucose by comparing metabolomic profiles of mothers with high and low fasting plasma glucose (FPG). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We compared fasting serum from an oral glucose tolerance test at âˆ¼28 weeks' gestation from 67 Northern European ancestry mothers from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study with high (>90th percentile) FPG with 50 mothers with low (<10th percentile) FPG but comparable BMI. Metabolic data from biochemical analyses of conventional clinical metabolites, targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based measurement of amino acids, and nontargeted gas chromatography/MS were subjected to per-metabolite analyses and collective pathway analyses using Unipathway annotation. RESULTS High-FPG mothers had a metabolic profile consistent with insulin resistance including higher triglycerides, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and amino acids including alanine, proline, and branched-chain amino acids (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted P < 0.05). Lower 1,5-anhydroglucitol in high-FPG mothers suggested recent hyperglycemic excursions (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05). Pathway analyses indicated differences in amino acid degradation pathways for the two groups (FDR-adjusted P < 0.05), consistent with population-based findings in nonpregnant populations. Exploratory analyses with newborn outcomes indicated positive associations for maternal triglycerides with neonatal sum of skinfolds and cord C-peptide and a negative association between maternal glycine and cord C-peptide (P < 0.05).

074a3e5be2302cedbd80238fc6cb4e876675b3eb,"Multiple Inference and Gender Differences in the Effects of Early Intervention: A Reevaluation of the Abecedarian, Perry Preschool, and Early Training Projects","The view that the returns to educational investments are highest for early childhood interventions is widely held and stems primarily from several influential randomized trialsâ€”Abecedarian, Perry, and the Early Training Projectâ€”that point to super-normal returns to early interventions. This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits fo...",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Michael L.

5917fa7812d38889c0b745421fdc4b85eafde2f8,Abstract 1487: Gene expression and linkage analysis implicates CBLB as a mediator of rituximab resistance,"Drug resistance remains one of the largest challenges in the curative treatment of cancer. We investigated the problem of monoclonal antibody resistance in vitro in a high throughput, complement-dependent cytotoxic (CDC) assay using immortalized as well as cancerous cell lines. First, the heritability of rituximab and ofatumumab sensitivity was explored using Epstein Barr Virus-immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines from two independent sources: a collection of trios (95 samples, 13 trios) from the Centre dâ€™Etude du Polymorphisme Humain and an unrelated collection (486 samples) from the Children9s Hospital Oakland Research Initiative. Cell viability in the presence or absence of 10ug/ml rituximab or 10ug/ml ofatumumab treatment was quantitated using AlamarBlue. Heritability was estimated using variance component analysis using MERLIN: H 2 = 33.11% (p 2 = 31.11% (p 6) result across all three analyses; this result for rituximab response occurred within the gene, SMOC2. Next, linkage analysis on the 95 related samples revealed one significant linkage peak on chromosome 12 for rituximab and two significant peaks for ofatumumab, on chromosome 12 and 3. Also, we identified genes whose mRNA expression level was correlated with the degree of either rituximab or ofatumumab sensitivity. Quantitative Significance Analysis of Microarrays revealed 13 genes whose expression was correlated with rituximab sensitivity and 25 genes whose expression was correlated with ofatumumab sensitivity (false discovery rate cutoff Citation Format: John Jack, George Small, Tammy Havener, Chad Brown, Howard McLeod, Alison Motsinger, Kristy L.

Neural Correlates in Musical Deficits in Schizophrenia,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference S290 Poster Session II 1Johns Hopkins University, Kennedy Krieger Institute; 2Johns Hopkins University Background: The thalamus, a critical node in which multiple cerebral circuits converge, is organized into multiple subnuclei, classified as either firstorder (receiving peripheral sensory input) or higher-order (receiving input primarily from the cortex). Higher-order nuclei are of particular salience in psychotic disorders, as they appear to control cortico-cortical information transmission, possibly through regulation of neuronal synchrony. Substantial evidence has demonstrated abnormalities of thalamo-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia, generally with hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor and temporal cortices and hypoconnectivity with frontal regions. We took advantage of the spatial resolution of 7T (voxels of 3.375 mm3 vs 27 mm3 at 3T) to preliminarily assess resting state connectivity between specific thalamic nuclei and cortical regions in schizophrenia. Methods: Resting state fMRI scans were obtained for 14 SCZ patients (mean age 39.5, mean disease duration 18.8 years) and 14 matched controls (smoking, age, sex) using a Phillps 7T imaging system, with GRE EPI (TR/TE/ FA=2000/22ms/60o, voxel=2.5mm iso, 54 slices, 7min. Data analysis was carried out with SPM8 / Matlab6. Preprocessing included realignment, slice time correction, co-registration, segmentation, normalization; nuisance removal (CompCor), regression of global mean and motion parameters; spatially smoothing (5mm kernel) and temporal filtering (0.01-0.1Hz). Seed-based analysis was carried out using thalamic sub-regions as described in the Oxford Thalamic Connectivity Atlas (seven regions based on anatomic connectivity rather than histology), and whole brain connectivity maps (z values) to each seed were calculated. Second-level t-tests were performed to examine differential connectivity between SCZ patients and controls (thresholded at a voxellevel of p<.001 and multiple-comparisons corrected at a cluster-level threshold of p<.05). Effect size was estimated with Cohenâ€™s d. The IBASPM116 atlas was used to identify anatomical regions within the significant clusters. Results: Both reduced and enhanced functional connectivity between the thalamus and multiple brain regions were observed. Statistically significant differences between scz and controls were detected in 47 regions, with particularly strong differences between scz and control in thalamo-temporal cortex connectivity, consistent with previous results at 3T. The same analysis was performed but with seeds placed in each of the seven thalamic subregions defined by the Oxford thalamic connectivity atlas. Enhanced connectivity was observed between all thalamic sub-regions and the motor cortex. Enhanced connectivity to the temporal cortex was detected in several thalamic sub-regions, but not sub-region 7, which has the highest anatomical connection probability in controls. Reduced functional connectivity in SCZ was detected between thalamic sub-regions 4, 6, and 7, and prefrontal and cingulate cortex. Discussion: Our results provide preliminary evidence of changes in resting state thalamo-cortical connectivity in schizophrenia that are specific to particular thalamic subregions. If confirmed by larger scale studies, identifying altered functional connectivity patterns of specific thalamic subnuclei may provide important clues about the pathogenic process in schizophrenia, with the potential of serving as biomarkers for use in therapeutic development.

NEUROANATOMICAL PROFILES OF TREATMENT-RESISTANCE IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Eric Plitman*,1, Yusuke Iwata1, Shinichiro Nakajima1, Jun Ku Chung1, Raihaan Patel2, Fernando Caravaggio1, Julia Kim1, Vincenzo De Luca1, Sofia Chavez1, Gary Remington1, M. Mallar Chakravarty2, Philip Gerretsen1, Ariel Graff-Guerrero1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of Toronto; 2Douglas Mental Health University Institute, McGill University Background: About 20 to 35% of patients with schizophrenia show partial or no response to standard first-line antipsychotic treatment and are thus believed to have treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Notably, the antipsychotic clozapine (CLZ) has been reported to have superior efficacy compared to other agents for the treatment of TRS. However, a subset of patients still do not respond to CLZ treatment and are thus considered to have ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS). Overall, the pathophysiology associated with UTRS appears to be different than TRS, yet both remain elusive. In light of the unknown factors underlying UTRS and TRS, along with the widely reported structural alterations that exist in patients with schizophrenia, our study aimed to examine subcortical structure volumes and cortical thickness in patients with UTRS, patients with TRS responding to CLZ (henceforth, TRS), patients responding to a firstline antipsychotic (treatment non-resistant schizophrenia (TnRS)), and healthy controls (HC). We hypothesized that deficits in subcortical structure volumes and cortical thickness would exist within the UTRS group compared to other groups. Methods: As of December 2017, the sample consisted of a total of 94 participants, including 24 patients with UTRS, 24 patients with TRS, 21 patients with TnRS, and 25 HCs. Participants underwent a 3-dimensional T1-weighted scan in a 3T MRI machine. The MAGeT-Brain segmentation algorithm was used to acquire volumes of the thalamus, striatum, globus pallidus, hippocampus, and amygdala. Cortical thickness was estimated using the CIVET processing pipeline. Total brain volume was obtained using the BEaST method. Group comparisons were performed using analyses of covariance and post-hoc comparisons. Results: Group volumetric differences were identified bilaterally within the thalamus, striatum, and globus pallidus (p<0.01). Post-hoc investigations revealed that bilateral thalamic volumes were smaller in the UTRS group compared to the HC group (p<0.01), bilateral striatal volumes were larger in the TnRS group compared to the UTRS and HC groups (p<0.01), and bilateral globus pallidus volumes were larger in the TnRS group compared to the HC group (p<0.01). No differences in hippocampal, amygdala, or total brain volume were observed. At a 5% false discovery rate, widespread cortical thinning was identified in both the UTRS and TRS groups compared to the TnRS and HC groups; this effect was stronger and more diffuse in the UTRS group. Discussion: Our findings suggest that thalamic volume deficits might be a distinct feature of UTRS. Contrastingly, striatal and globus pallidus volume enlargement may be associated with first-line antipsychotic response or treatment. Cortical thinning is apparent in both the UTRS and TRS groups. In many cases, structural compromise appears to follow a continuum of response, whereby deficits are most severe in UTRS patients, followed by TRS patients, who are followed by TnRS patients and HCs.

NEURAL CORRELATES IN MUSICAL DEFICITS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA Ken Sawada*,1, Sanae Hatada2, Ryoshuke Fujito3, William Honer4 1Kochi Medical School; 2Tosa Rehabilitation College; 3Fujito Hospital; 4University of British Columbia Background: Several studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia have low musical ability that correlates with poor cognitive functions and severe negative symptoms. Recently, using surface-based analysis, we reported that thinner cortical thickness in the left temporal, parietal, and inferior frontal regions is associated with lower musical ability in schizophrenia. Interestingly, thicker cortical thickness in the left supramarginal region correlates with lower musical ability in controls. Musical deficits such as congenital amusia was shown to contribute to white and grey matter pathophysiology in schizophrenia. We, therefore, sought to investigate diffusion tensor images (DTI) of patients with schizophrenia using an automated probabilistic tractography algorithm.",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Ken Sawada"", ids = ""11459823""); list(name = ""Sanae Hatada"", ids = ""4511156""); list(name = ""Ryoshuke Fujito"", ids = ""40898997""); list(name = ""William G Honer"", ids = ""2476686"")",,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,44,S290 - S291

To identify markers associated with TMPRSS2â€“ERG fusion and prognostic of biochemical recurrence, we analysed a cohort of 139 men with prostate cancer for 502 molecular markers.Methods:RNA from radical prostatectomy tumour specimens was analysed using cDNA-mediated, annealing, selection, extension and ligation (DASL) to determine mRNAs associated with TMPRSS2â€“ERG T1/E4 fusion and prognostic of biochemical recurrence. Differentially expressed mRNAs in T1/E4-positive tumours were determined using significance analysis of microarrays (false discovery rate (FDR) <5%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression determined genes, gene signatures and clinical factors prognostic of recurrence (P-value <0.05, logâ€“rank test). Analysis of two prostate microarray studies (GSE1065 and GSE8402) validated the findings.Results:In the 139 patients from this study and from a 455-patient Swedish cohort, 15 genes in common were differentially regulated in T1/E4 fusion-positive tumours (FDR <0.05). The most significant mRNAs in both cohorts coded ERG. Nine genes were found prognostic of recurrence in this study and in a 596-patient Minnesota cohort. A molecular recurrence score was significant in prognosticating recurrence (P-value 0.000167) and remained significant in multivariate analysis of a mixed clinical model considering Gleason score and TMPRSS2â€“ERG fusion status.Conclusions:TMPRSS2â€“ERG T1/E4 fusion-positive tumours had differentially regulated mRNAs observed in multiple studies, the most significant one coded for ERG. Several mRNAs were consistently associated with biochemical recurrence and have potential clinical utility but will require further validation for successful translation.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Benjamin G.

fbafc3758e32ce99c3d7620d0142687e0910b035,Genome-Wide Association Studies Associated with Backfat Thickness in Landrace and Yorkshire Pigs,"Although pork quality traits are important commercially, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have not well considered Landrace and Yorkshire pigs worldwide. Landrace and Yorkshire pigs are important pork-providing breeds. Although quantitative trait loci of pigs are well-developed, significant genes in GWASs of pigs in Korea must be studied. Through a GWAS using the PLINK program, study of the significant genes in Korean pigs was performed. We conducted a GWAS and surveyed the gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the backfat thickness (BF) trait of these pigs. We included the breed information (Yorkshire and Landrace pigs) as a covariate. The significant genes after false discovery rate (ï¼œ0.01) correction were AFG1L, SCAI, RIMS1, and SPDEF. The major GO terms for the top 5% of genes were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. The neuronal genes were previously reported as being associated with backfat thickness. However, the genes in our results were novel, and they included ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2. These novel genes might have roles in important cellular and physiological functions related to BF accumulation. The genes related to cell morphogenesis were NOX4, MKLN1, ZNF280D, BAIAP2, DNAAF1, LRTM2, PCDH15, NGFR, RBPJ, MYH9, APBB2, DTNBP1, TRIM62, and SLIT2.

An especially high rate of false discoveries has been reported in some areas motivating the creation of resource-intensive collaborations to estimate the replication rate of published research by repeating a large number of studies. The substantial amount of resources required by these replication projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings. Methods and findings In 2013, Jager and Leek developed a method to estimate the empirical false discovery rate from journal abstracts and applied their method to five high profile journals. Here, we use the relative efficiency of Jager and Leekâ€™s method to gather p-values from over 30,000 abstracts and to subsequently estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a five-year time span. We model the empirical false discovery rate by journal subject area (cancer or general medicine), impact factor, and Open Access status. We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer vs. general medicine journals (p = 5.14E-6). Within cancer journals, we find that this relationship is further modified by journal impact factor where a lower journal impact factor is associated with a higher empirical false discovery rate (p = 0.012, 95% CI: âˆ’0.010, âˆ’0.001). We find no significant differences, on average, in the false discovery rate for Open Access vs closed access journals (p = 0.256, 95% CI: âˆ’0.014, 0.051). Conclusions We find evidence of a higher false discovery rate in cancer journals compared to general medicine journals, especially for those with a lower journal impact factor. For cancer journals, a lower journal impact factor of one point is associated with a 0.006 increase in the empirical false discovery rate, on average. For a false discovery rate of 0.05, this would result in over a 10% increase to 0.056. Conversely, we find no significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access vs. closed access journals from InCites. Our results identify areas of research that may need additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Lauren M.

a68733bd7b2651e84ab739a3ca635c3d0e7a3abf,The transcriptome of syncytia induced by the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii in Arabidopsis roots,"Arabidopsis thaliana is a host for the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. Juvenile nematodes invade the roots and induce the development of a syncytium, which functions as a feeding site for the nematode. Here, we report on the transcriptome of syncytia induced in the roots of Arabidopsis. Microaspiration was employed to harvest pure syncytium material, which was then used to prepare RNA for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChips. Initial data analysis showed that the gene expression in syncytia at 5 and 15 days post-infection did not differ greatly, and so both time points were compared together with control roots. Out of a total of 21 138 genes, 18.4% (3893) had a higher expression level and 15.8% (3338) had a lower expression level in syncytia, as compared with control roots, using a multiple-testing corrected false discovery rate of below 5%. A gene ontology (GO) analysis of up- and downregulated genes showed that categories related to high metabolic activity were preferentially upregulated. A principal component analysis was applied to compare the transcriptome of syncytia with the transcriptome of different Arabidopsis organs (obtained by the AtGenExpress project), and with specific root tissues. This analysis revealed that syncytia are transcriptionally clearly different from roots (and all other organs), as well as from other root tissues.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Dagmar Szakasits"", ids = ""6640354""); list(name = ""Petra Heinen"", ids = ""38028694""); list(name = ""Krzysztof Wieczorek"", ids = ""36863075""); list(name = ""Julia C.

Preterm birth can have both immediate and long-term adverse effects on the health of the baby. Developing biomarkers of inflammation in the placenta can help to understand its effects and potentially lead to new approaches for rapid prenatal diagnosis of aCA. We aimed to characterize epigenetic variation associated with aCA in placenta (chorionic villi) and fetal membranes (chorion and amnion) to better understand how aCA may impact processes that lead to preterm birth. This study lays the groundwork for development of novel biomarkers for aCA.MethodsSamples from 44 preterm placentas (chorionic villi) as well as matched chorion and amnion for 16 of these cases were collected for this study. These samples were profiled using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation850 BeadChip to measure DNA methylation (DNAm) at 866,895 CpGs across the genome. An additional 78 placental samples were utilized to independently validate the array findings by pyrosequencing.ResultsUsing a false discovery rate of <â€‰0.15 and average group difference in DNAm of >â€‰0.05, 66 differentially methylated (DM) CpG sites were identified between aCA cases and non-aCA cases in chorionic villi. For the majority of these 66 DM CpGs, the DNAm profile of the aCA cases as compared to the non-aCA cases trended in the direction of the blood cell DNAm. Interestingly, neutrophil-specific DNAm signatures, but not those associated with other immune cell types, were capable of separating aCA cases from the non-aCA cases.ConclusionsOur results suggest that aCA-associated placentas showed altered DNAm signatures that were not observed in the absence of aCA. This DNAm profile is consistent with the activation of the innate immune response in the placenta and/or reflect increase in neutrophils as a response to inflammation.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chaini Konwar"", ids = ""17001529""); list(name = ""Elmer M.

421f943e7fe465fbd13215d1b7b0b2db4a06af91,The doseâ€“response association of urinary metals with altered pulmonary function and risks of restrictive and obstructive lung diseases: a population-based study in China,"OBJECTIVE
Reduced pulmonary function is an important predictor of environment-related pulmonary diseases; however, evidence of an association between exposures to various metals from all possible routes and altered pulmonary function is limited. We aimed to investigate the association of various metals in urine with pulmonary function, restrictive lung disease (RLD) and obstructive lung disease (OLD) risks in the general Chinese population.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional investigation in the Wuhan cohort population.


SETTING
A heavily polluted Chinese city.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 2460 community-living Chinese adults from the Wuhan cohort were included in our analysis.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Spirometric parameters (FVC, forced vital capacity; FEV1, forced expiratory volumes in 1â€…s; FEV1/FVC ratio), RLD and OLD.


RESULTS
The dose-response associations of pulmonary function, and RLD and OLD, with 23 urinary metals were assessed using regression analysis after adjusting for potential confounders. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to correct for multiple hypothesis tests. Our results indicated that there were positive dose-response associations of urinary iron with FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio, vanadium with FEV1, and copper and selenium with FEV1/FVC ratio, while a negative dose-response association was observed between urinary lead and FEV1/FVC ratio (all p<0.05). After additional adjusting for multiple comparisons, only iron was dose dependently related to FEV1/FVC ratio (FDR adjusted p<0.05). The dose-response association of iron and lead, with decreased and increased chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk, respectively, was also observed (both p<0.05). Additionally, we found significant association of urinary zinc with RLD and interaction effects of smoking status with lead on FEV1/FVC, and with cadmium on FVC and FEV1.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that multiple urinary metals are associated with altered pulmonary function, and RLD and OLD prevalences.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Feng"", ids = ""144316362""); list(name = ""Xiji Huang"", ids = ""4730840""); list(name = ""Ce Zhang"", ids = ""47423271""); list(name = ""Chuanyao Liu"", ids = ""4234662""); list(name = ""Xiuqing Cui"", ids = ""50471336""); list(name = ""Yun Zhou"", ids = ""47943176""); list(name = ""Huizhen Sun"", ids = ""48729066""); list(name = ""Gaokun Qiu"", ids = ""13458870""); list(name = ""Huan Guo"", ids = ""1729940""); list(name = ""Meian He"", ids = ""8362646""); list(name = ""Xiaomin Zhang"", ids = ""47957628""); list(name = ""Jing Yuan"", ids = ""145078778""); list(name = ""Weihong Chen"", ids = ""2467426""); list(name = ""Tangchun Wu"", ids = ""3567607"")",8ebdb16a543a29f5188aa20917752e3ffaaa0be7; 4d4f85c4db2cdbb2477de3979c72bd9902c042ed; 62bfa68cc921761b00315a1dffa29008dd4fff5e; 1dbc68efac5e1345e207fc29a42829de2f35602b,40dc707b0ff7d0f170d7a885c31e9257d7d2932f; 3871457f2c9015e7a6328a8a9a835e781ea63fcb; cd9e6bc994ff0b2eceb6120bc8a5a7e7094f897a; 6ecd5aed1e5751ee0007eeeffd7216f2e2a7750b; 1888ae228b7ab79049eece22cd28cd647c7acaae; 30995024875b7d56ffdf8c3d44c3f5133d6ad469; 0d1d29692cd4f220968d0628a6f3fbb2221a351a; e818002f9393a222cf49e8e252e002c6ce9a66d3; 2d54f0f9c4de86b34c75a343c0cf99656386d308; cefd504fcb42e1e4a5daf5e775d8501f99845973; 18f54db823e399443ff054ef58a7c8864c691afa; 1eaecf34930ca400e1760d5a7f5809e0552a1a1c; ce3ebc5d2a8b6dc39a213f76c2e2ed89260481d9; efbadfd5b9f210eac1be23ff5cf28a3d4d21e1df; 644fcfa2a68aa77ba60ba74674088e058b98a7a5; 412ea098802167b484c7e421f8d869906f1e03a7; d72b67e117394cf01e3d4e456a85700ad660105f; 4ebf2ba0d9205a6f36d54456ca75408471e93f3e; a4b162af0bda54258100e5d674fd7c4b5a26d811; ba7e7f642bea8a0b8663314dbc05c35342b83624; 30dff378db030c22771efacac06b7e87f033304f; 674a98ecf91313cc7c50c6908de3756e87145593; f80408affd40d5bdb4e0db5764bd5dcd11cd175b; 8d23a5de38cc4e11e6262bccbb6201a59001d7d3; 1d3d73680324376b8b51c4cba8173e09eab265f1; c254a98bd2a587a11e1c1b6c28e015eaea25deb1; 935830a47c955d2204cddf142fa04bc08f9ace66; 229ce4964db0aa3754edc29a762ae2743a12f684; 0e7bdaf9805908de84697ea9a8a2eed99dd5e044; ef699f9f5e61ef45fd49e805ee4b9af7dd297b53; ad56e5b96f6a33b82bb27342d85f31f482440a93; c012592153950cc1611b64905cc3aaf788278822; 1b28dbd1d0943801b3a082de91d5c0da43c3e038; 82b19314322416b25267104d428ce21ad904312a; 99a778b9be2748a23731925a21ce2e6e97dfed40; 3f17e107ac8a46329df8877b7bf9f1a926dc7b1f; 3160e05237e9425b0a4fd0b4670aa84135369a79; 38b3f599c195ad217c45eba71990a88a0b9cebba; e745bcbdc83b7f84b4562b5f4ec7c43da8f6b5f8,BMJ Open,5,
544715b02fb8c3232875b89e64e9aefba3ff7d56,Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP): Integrative Genomic and Transcriptomic Characterization of Burkitt Lymphoma,"Introduction Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a hallmark translocation involving MYC and an immunoglobulin enhancer. It is most common in children and has three clinical variants: endemic, sporadic, and HIV-associated. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated endemic subtype (eBL) is highly prevalent in equatorial Africa, where it is the most common pediatric cancer. Survival is poor among African children with eBL due to late stage at presentation and limitations in the ability to support intensive chemotherapeutic regimens necessary to induce durable remissions. Previous genomic studies of smaller BL cohorts revealed that eBL harbors mutation patterns similar but not identical to sporadic cases from high-resource countries. The BLGSP aims at conducting an integrative molecular characterization of a large comprehensive BL cohort including an unprecedented representation of endemic cases. The objective is to define molecular features that drive lymphomagenesis, which can be translated to new therapeutic strategies deployable worldwide. Methods Tumor biopsies and matched normal tissue have been collected from patients with both endemic and sporadic BL along with treatment, outcome, and other clinical information. Molecular characterization includes whole genome sequencing of tumor and constitutional DNA (80X and 40X, respectively), and strand-specific ribo-depleted sequencing of tumor RNA and microRNA. Six centroblast and 6 centrocyte samples flow-sorted from healthy donor tissue underwent RNA and miRNA sequencing as normal comparators for gene expression. These data enable the identification of somatic mutations, significantly mutated genes (SMGs) and non-coding loci with potential regulatory function; the quantification of human and EBV gene expression; and the characterization of miRNA-mediated regulation of transcripts. SMGs were supported by two or more of the following methods with a 10% false discovery rate: OncodriveFM, OncodriveFML, OncodriveCLUST, and MutSigCV. We also re-analyzed the genome data for 17 sporadic cases from the ICGC MALY-DE project (Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 1316-1325). Results A total of 101 cases (71 endemic and 30 sporadic) were included after quality control. We describe novel mutation features affecting known BL genes. Notably, DDX3X is the target of focal deletions and splicing branch point mutations, and in-frame deletions recurrently affect a putative ubiquitination site (K272) in GNAI2 . Our meta-analysis reveals 22 SMGs, including many that have not yet been linked to the disease (see figure). We associate recurrent mutations in the following genes with BL for the first time: SIN3A, HIST1H1E, KMT2D, CHD8, USP7, and RFX7 . Several SMGs are differentially mutated between endemic and sporadic BL, suggesting distinct underlying biology (see highlighted genes in figure). For instance, ARID1A is preferentially mutated in endemic cases whereas SMARCA4 shows the opposite trend. Multiple non-coding loci are also significantly mutated: a PAX5 enhancer, BCL6 super-enhancers, the PVT1 non-coding locus, and the miR-142 gene, among others. Three mutation signatures are detected across all tumors: one is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair, another has been linked to polymerase Î· and AID activity, and the last signature has an unknown etiology. Gene expression analysis reveals high correlation between tumors (Pearson coefficient > 0.9). This is consistent with the absence of robust clusters according to unsupervised clustering of expression profiles. Discussion BLGSP is an ongoing international collaborative project aimed at providing a comprehensive molecular portrait of BL across all subtypes. We describe previously unreported mutation features affecting established BL genes and identify novel candidate coding and non-coding driver mutations, nominating compelling targets for therapy. For example, one of the novel SMGs, USP7, encodes a deubiquitinase that counteracts Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. We hypothesize that Mdm2 inhibitors might trigger synthetic lethality in USP7 -mutated, TP53 -wildtype tumors. In summary, this effort has identified candidate molecular targets for therapy that can potentially lead to more effective treatments that are less toxic than the current regimens.

36cc67b0874cb32e3d728ffa5abb77653321722e,A genomic scanning using AFLP to detect candidate loci under selection in the finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides).,"Identifying loci under natural selection from genomic surveys is of great interest in different research areas, stimulated by the increasing ease with large numbers of markers to gain a genome-wide perspective on differentiation. In this study, we searched for the genetic signatures of selection by screening 114 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in three finless porpoise populations inhabiting contrasting natural environments (freshwater and marine habitat). Comparing among three populations, four AFLP loci exhibited F(ST) values higher than 0.975 quantile which might be inferred to be under divergent selection and two loci fell below the 0.025 quantile which might be affected by balancing selection. Although these loci were not supported with statistical significance in false discovery rate (FDR) analysis, the present study illustrated the potential of genome-wide surveys to identify specific genome regions or genes associated with freshwater adaptation of the finless porpoise.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lian Chen"", ids = ""144206084""); list(name = ""Guang Yang"", ids = ""143951511"")",dcfe96400b1e25153fbbeab3ec44bff7d646bf34,0ac1669911091a3fd2a9ec80bb0890a2c796c472; 8229508460c78baa52807e0bd11607135e1e83d3; 4b2becc1eb813c1b99d6dd6b7638dced6da63c02; 9ee1c2889bf1b2d4aa533f8c05ee2fc816d95027; 41f2a39c9cac4757a79f6186aa07a65df6147f8a; 344a2a3d5279965d276d9f918d9e733a99b6b30f; 7260355586741aaea8698cf527f809a8cfc9c777; 09f9200b4f5c2922fd955079911b5a8479adac33; 9a0ed8f3bde3025a5ca8be7f325cdde5b8f9e1b8; ebe8cc4a4a88a738922df30a1e2e575d5a665e60; 04722629a1424bd897c07db640318489fd1b1153; e4cd34b6938395d14421155f2bf72444b1c54525; 0dad85e93efed5590e5231a97de100f17da4650e; 04afb52988fbf07ff6b47a9f2b7596b43df3e846; 0477a91a15aec8cbfee61deda1aff5a64b442442; 5d49033338c0c41eb52ec4e518316abd402558a0; cc6ad46cf1d8c895c62dc0a936ae3b8c9ab59183; 050dab90ded6f29706d1af0fa2f084de8ee9f216; bdcb3075488fdf0acfcd8a32cbd295ed7dbc01f1; df416cefd01d304ec2e21313ec6dd86bc922cd9f; 64fdf01f9c1e9a16545153cb6f0678a68058cb54; cad327e1e3a0799202cb40da5da51d7b0616b64e; 510264ef146fb268103d55564012b0b7569537f0; 32a3476a1db2662cc0e273b7853e1b239095e3b5; b7c4f6548920e439604ff6b6e493cb53937fa9bc; fde8b15d2e374ab2f635217f1a0d46aee209613b; db9f53b973da3f143f6b91983ccbbf5ac9978e42; 864fa1af72f755e56c19676db1049f4b696d5078; 20a6965ce6c37771877119fb2a882ba450620504; b2f88683afd09a888404d2ae3f87716f989c6ab0; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; eaa404c54047f813c4aa8b73db9f7af85bd40121; 6d0d3c9f66dd146e09450b3ab53726eca773c7cf; e42d8f0369e33f6e4284938d31ef1df6ffb7aa35; 1efe9799d2a257f082e75b4fd1a16771b8b3dc59; 014c619f1985a7903017703a7f69b3a8f4f28ed1; 127a890cefbad00c8d5c3087a136668c3f434904; 91586b66e729faf334ca4b6ea921a679a422cfcb; 094fc6fbd1f1b802c3b16471cb86a6957531bc1b; 2bb806d6929b99b2f70358da37ff8c443dceb6a5; bb817b8ab5a39a2dd80980a1a61620b8e2739b6d,Genes & genetic systems,84 4,"

5211b37891c2081e89c566c7b76249f698c008fe,Integral quantification accuracy estimation for reporter ion-based quantitative proteomics (iQuARI).,"With the increasing popularity of comparative studies of complex proteomes, reporter ion-based quantification methods such as iTRAQ and TMT have become commonplace in biological studies. Their appeal derives from simple multiplexing and quantification of several samples at reasonable cost. This advantage yet comes with a known shortcoming: precursors of different species can interfere, thus reducing the quantification accuracy. Recently, two methods were brought to the community alleviating the amount of interference via novel experimental design. Before considering setting up a new workflow, tuning the system, optimizing identification and quantification rates, etc. one legitimately asks: is it really worth the effort, time and money? The question is actually not easy to answer since the interference is heavily sample and system dependent. Moreover, there was to date no method allowing the inline estimation of error rates for reporter quantification. We therefore introduce a method called iQuARI to compute false discovery rates for reporter ion based quantification experiments as easily as Target/Decoy FDR for identification. With it, the scientist can accurately estimate the amount of interference in his sample on his system and eventually consider removing shadows subsequently, a task for which reporter ion quantification might not be the solution of choice.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marc Vaudel"", ids = ""2794449""); list(name = ""Julia Maria Burkhart"", ids = ""6235823""); list(name = ""Sonja Radau"", ids = ""14445202""); list(name = ""RenÃ© Peiman Zahedi"", ids = ""3765021""); list(name = ""Lennart Martens"", ids = ""145632158""); list(name = ""Albert Sickmann"", ids = ""3053981"")",2db8f9d4d2ada67bcfd7f325f785fa2f80727a44; 0e78fa44ec780a6f21f4b753398668a06e7c91cf; c125de3edbc006a03dcce48bf14800082a308ec3; c2513e7953732a54ec92f3f0d3682f22b47c6662; 82e90a86287a6f282b7a90f41fd12024caecf1ef; 4b113f05f949aacb1316203645db052caf8a9846; 7ec83acff3a1dbe0a1bcebea956b971b7c476c8b; 43fbafd111c4b5d193b735a93f435e7619a261a4; b9e41312df33400b9bba6318b757a3badbf4f7ac; 71dca34692fdf0df992c0e3d41f8fb07cb82247c,8cbae8809ee33c512ea5180f5c4721137d848e6f; 526a6d5d69b96f08e8325ebd22e21bf2fdbd8826; fa7a346a2e3214b95b26fd67dc95b4a517c71426; aaee5a4e250d4841f5d545b5a93ad423b7c8bf96; 90b3d4d822576199aa46254a74a6d0732be9ff56; f89116adc97c01ea49097e2ad4a42edec86d0cf4; 3afc59fc5d9467e5d36a787cfdf982410188b334; 492260a3502fa6f937c86134c00cd4d3c356c3f7; 8922a384a53fcdc972851719c2e16512ff9d9639; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; bcfa7991b7e3ad3480b4f838db645830776d09e9; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 798a12eae470b435451b4e9f7ddd07b0e71cd1f5; c0ec77d23d1e3113f376776d63b304954e40011e; f55781157f01ccb07242080a59d4364829d73323; d1e76d6ea4216419b579d917a55d8367072c723a; 7289f6ccbe433da35bd8b14fb782b665af909b46; 644cc7f6990bf3a02e3bcb48930eb9cbf9ed6c03; 083b5b8534f854fee5c1b2978296391076d97c0e; 35f6dc62bdb2b6dc9c6e4093319c8ab29db60bce; a4ab0813facfeba304cda0d475820deac681abe1; ddc98c4b96d7ad908f89cc60aa0bf3083484a0ab; 6cade22a0fe2fd35b243d3afa995c6891664cdb6; f3954102573d3378a33db969d3ab830efcb69c69; 1fc2ac60266a6250440833001cee879625da16e3; 4ef64634f351d31f51e5c4bc9855b11e6248934c; 663c38a053775133b7b777f9e90072ab2a2a84d9; 9ee5016f5071e21bf28eb211af5d1ea681b3b3c6; 1a99838fd2513e6f2c9f4124e419ff45ee69fac9; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 3fa0bb850594505a1fb1aba3024e3855a915f315; 955fe5b0eb5e9fefab7bf21dede20e1285dca410; 77d5f7c21bca2733eacf023401a7c1fc0b560627; 93d16fb4b149b1c9068d6392fd882933b9388cd0,Journal of proteome research,11 10,"

We examined whether the common IKZF1 polymorphisms rs4132601 T/G and rs111978267 A/G are associated with ALL among a Tunisian pediatric cohort.MethodsThis case-control study involved 170 patients with ALL and 150 control subjects. SNP genotyping was performed by TaqManÂ® SNP Genotyping Assay.ResultsThe minor allele G of IKZF1 gene polymorphism rs4132601 T/G was significantly higher in ALL cases than in control subjects (PÂ =â€‰0.029), with 1.54-fold increased risk of ALL. The association of rs4132601 with ALL was seen under co-dominant (PÂ =â€‰0.009), recessive (PÂ =â€‰0.006), and additive (PÂ =â€‰0.027) genetic models, of which the co-dominant (PÂ =â€‰0.027) and recessive (PÂ =â€‰0.027) association remained significant after adjusting for covariates, and False Discovery Rate correction. In contrast, no association was noted for rs111978267 variant. Two-locus (rs4132601-rs11978267) IKZF1 haplotype analysis demonstrated association of GA (PÂ =â€‰0.053), with increased ALL risk [OR (95% CI)â€‰=â€‰1.58 (1.00â€“2.51)], which remained significant after controlling for key covariates [aPÂ =â€‰0.046; aOR (95% CI)â€‰=â€‰1.61 (1.01â€“2.57)].ConclusionWe demonstrated the association of IKZF1 polymorphism rs4132601 T/G with increased risk of ALL among Tunisian pediatric cohort, with altered phenotypic changes among ALL patients.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sana Mahjoub"", ids = ""50379763""); list(name = ""Vera Chayeb"", ids = ""6880185""); list(name = ""HÃ©dia Zitouni"", ids = ""4423748""); list(name = ""Rabeb M.

30b5460e55b25c6c9776cf94ce9d81821bddd5b9,Leptin gene variants and colorectal cancer risk: Sex-specific associations,"BACKGROUND
High levels of serum leptin and low levels of serum adiponectin are strongly correlated with obesity, a well-established risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Growing evidence suggests that dysregulation of leptin and adiponectin levels may play an etiological role in colorectal carcinogenesis. We evaluated 20 candidate variants in 4 genes previously shown to alter serum leptin and adiponectin levels for associations with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) and CRC risk.


METHODS
We analyzed 6,246 CRC cases and 7,714 population-based controls from 11 studies within the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Associations of each variant with obesity or CRC were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models stratified by sex and adjusted for age, a study variable, and the first three principal components of genetic ancestry. Gene-specific False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-values <0.05 denoted statistical significance.


RESULTS
Two variants in the leptin gene showed statistically significant associations with CRC among women: LEP rs2167270 (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06-1.21) and LEP rs4731426 (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17). These associations remained significant after adjustment for obesity, suggesting that leptin SNPs may influence CRC risk independent of obesity. We observed statistically significant interactions of the leptin variants with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for CRC risk; these variant associations were strengthened when analyses were restricted to post-menopausal women with low estrogen exposure, as estimated by 'never use' of HRT and/or non-obese BMI. No variants were associated with CRC among men.


CONCLUSIONS
Leptin gene variants may exhibit sex-specific associations with CRC risk. Endogenous and exogenous estrogen exposure may modify the association between these variants, leptin levels, and CRC risk.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kelsey A Chun"", ids = ""51914950""); list(name = ""Jonathan M Kocarnik"", ids = ""6436920""); list(name = ""Sheetal Hardikar"", ids = ""145898544""); list(name = ""Jamaica R.

a4e8553ceea3c8a67e2bfb73829524aa8575fcc4,Efeito do treinamento fisico em judocas e corredores fundistas de alto nivel na plasticidade neural,"Estudos experimentais tem sugerido que a pratica de exercicios fisicos associados a treinamento, planejamento e execucao de movimentos complexos causam alteracoes estruturais no sistema nervoso. Essas podem refletir modificacoes beneficas a plasticidade cerebral, em resposta ao aumento da atividade imposta pela aprendizagem motora e exercicios fisicos. Todavia, efeitos estruturais, com potencial implicacao para o auxilio em reabilitacao de problemas neurologicos, nao sao bem entendidos. A pratica de judo demanda planejamento de atividades motoras complexas e exercicios fisicos. A pratica de corrida de fundo demanda pouca aprendizagem motora e contem exercicios fisicos. Nosso objetivo foi Investigar variacoes no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta estimulada pela pratica de judo e corrida de fundo atraves de morfometria baseada em voxels (VBM) em imagens de ressonÃ¢ncia magnetica (RM). Imagens de RM foram feitas em atletas de judo, de corrida de fundo e nao atletas em um scanner de 2T (Elscint Prestige, Haifa, Israel). VBM foi feita usando os programas de analise matematica estatistica de imagem (Statistical Parametric Mapping, SPM 2 e Matlab 7.0), utilizando imagens em T1 e voxels isotropicos de 1mm. Os mapas probabilisticos com a substÃ¢ncia cinzenta foram comparados voxel a voxel usando teste t-student para determinar diferencas significativas na CSC entre os grupos. Os resultados finais foram corrigidos por um algoritmo de correcao para achados falso-positivos (False Discovery Rate - FDR) que minimiza o efeito das multiplas comparacoes e eleva a sensibilidade do resultado final. Foram encontrados aumentos significativos no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta, no grupo de judocas em diversas areas, descritas a seguir: Motoras primarias e suplementar no hemisferio esquerdo: giro pre-central (227 voxels); giro frontal superior (398 Voxels); giro frontal medio (34 Voxels); area motora suplementar (196 Voxels). E no hemisferio direito: area motora suplementar (51 Voxels). Areas relacionadas a planejamento no hemisferio esquerdo: giro frontal inferior triangular (418 Voxels); rolando opercular (62 Voxels); giro frontal medio orbital (56 Voxels); giro reto (69 Voxels). No hemisferio direito, giro frontal inferior triangular, (162 Voxels) e giro reto (517 Voxels). Areas relacionadas a concentracao no hemisferio esquerdo: giro frontal superior orbital (357 Voxels); giro frontal medio orbital (305 Voxels); giro frontal inferior opercular (530 Voxels). No hemisferio direito: giro frontal superior orbital (283 Voxels); giro frontal inferior opercular (472 Voxels). Regiao dos lobos occipital e parietal, em areas relacionadas a visao e associativas no hemisferio esquerdo: giro occipital medio (133 Voxels); giro parietal superior (435 Voxels); giro parietal inferior (46 Voxels). No hemisferio direito: giro occipital superior (169 Voxels); giro parietal superior (114 Voxels). Regiao do lobo temporal em areas relacionadas a memoria do hemisferio esquerdo: lobulo para central (55 Voxels); giro temporal medio (326 Voxels); giro temporal inferior (1040 Voxels). No hemisferio direito: giro temporal medio (122 Voxels); giro temporal inferior (398 Voxels). Tambem foram encontrados aumento na concentracao de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta, no cerebelo em areas relacionadas a aprendizagem motora no hemisferio esquerdo: cerebelo 1 (32 Voxels); cerebelo 7b (51 Voxels). No hemisferio direito: cerebelo 6 (29 Voxels). No grupo de corredores fundistas, encontramos alteracoes significativas, com aumentos e diminuicoes na concentracao de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta em diversas areas. Diferentemente do que foi descrito no grupo de judocas, o grupo de corredores apresentou aumento e diminuicao na concentracao de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta em areas muito difusas. As alteracoes foram encontradas nas seguintes areas: Na regiao do lobo frontal: houve aumento no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta de 14.457 voxels, entretanto apresentou uma diminuicao de 5.720 voxels. A diferenca entre aumento e diminuicao no numero de voxels que representaria ganho, foi de 8.737 voxels. Na regiao do lobo temporal e na insula foram encontradas mais diminuicao que aumento: houve aumento no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta de 1.629 voxels, entretanto apresentou uma diminuicao muito maior, de 9.580 voxels. A diferenca entre aumento e diminuicao no numero de voxels que representaria perda, foi negativa em 7951 voxels. Regiao do lobo parietal foi encontrado aumento superior a diminuicao no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta: houve aumento no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta de 11.298 voxels, enquanto apresentou uma diminuicao de 10.725 voxels. A diferenca entre aumento e diminuicao no numero de voxels que representaria ganho, foi de 573 voxels. Regiao do lobo occipital foi encontrado aumento superior a diminuicao no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta: houve aumento no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta de 4.241 voxels, enquanto apresentou uma diminuicao de 1.047 voxels. A diferenca entre aumento e diminuicao no numero de voxels que representaria ganho, foi de 3.194 voxels. Tambem foram encontrados mais aumento que diminuicao no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta no cerebelo: houve aumento no volume de substÃ¢ncia cinzenta de 10.117 voxels, enquanto apresentou uma diminuicao de 7.778 voxels. A diferenca entre aumento e diminuicao no numero de voxels que representaria ganho, foi de 2.339 voxels. Sugerimos que a pratica de esportes resulte em alteracoes morfologicas no cortex motor primario, cerebelo e areas associativas. Nossos achados sugerem que planejamento motor e execucao de movimento, associada a pratica de exercicios fisicos podem induzir melhoras na plasticidade cerebral, e justificar o uso de esportes na reabilitacao de doencas neurologicas. Treinamento fisico em atletas judocas e corredores fundistas induz a plasticidade neural. A magnitude da plasticidade neural sao diferentes nessas duas modalidades, sugerindo que as mudancas podem ser especificas de acordo com a modalidade desportiva. O mecanismo da inducao da plasticidade neural pode ser relacionado a aprendizagem motora como visto nos judocas ou relacionado a possiveis efeitos de fatores troficos e hormonais no cerebro liberados durante o exercicio fisico prolongado como visto nos corredores fundistas

3f0fd5209b2e5c0bd6f8e2095097ad3252abbf9a,Detecting differentially expressed genes using calibrated bayes factors,"A common interest in microarray data analysis is to identify genes having changes in expression values between different biological conditions. The existing methods include using two-sample t-statistics, modified t-statistics (SAM), Bayesian t-statistics (Cyber-T), semiparametric hierarchical Bayesian models, and nonparametric permutation tests. All these methods essentially compare two population means. Unlike these methods, we consider using Bayes factors to compare gene expression levels that allows us to compare two population distributions. To adapt the use of Bayes factors to microarray data, we propose a new calibration approach that weighs two types of prior predictive error probabilities differently for each gene and, at the same time, controls the overall error rate for all genes. Moreover, a new gene selection algorithm based on the calibration approach is developed and its properties are examined. The proposed method is shown to have a smaller false discovery rate (FDR) and a smaller false non-discovery rate (FNDR) than several existing methods in several simulations. Finally, a data set from an affymetrix microarray experiment to identify genes associated with the mature osteoblast differentiation is used to further illustrate the proposed methodology.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Fang Zhou Yu"", ids = ""48107699""); list(name = ""Ming-Hui Chen"", ids = ""4464141""); list(name = ""Lynn Kuo"", ids = ""2883383"")",a6b4d002170562343e40dfb1d8114b6c7c35ee8b,ae319eb388276f25feb47c5c728bf3ce2c02d237; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; a2cf694adc66f98e3995288927c54bd24a0e0b3d; 9cc70eaaba70cf5784bc045682e534609ad684ae; 3752e465d9fe28e5345d44ceb9eabdb7572c9cd2; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976; 178e55a6ef96feeefe5c34b1822f4df9aed2a049; 99a0ee68b45be3e72ebe9c9833f620ee77ee5d22; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; ac71b91fd2c918b4e3b0162872e091992861ae6d; f1f4386524be3ed96caaf05f661aacb94db1e566; c330e4cb0b522d912f8ab0cc56e91de4ccb69275; a07facbc67310e00ac6f55e9fe58cdef8f86c174; 31f49b63a562fcdd995b70f09a0e9c3b47732fb8; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a,Statistica Sinica,18,783-802
10496e14e8a7af8b1b82f15a5a661e98727a56d6,Replication of Candidate Gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Previously Reported As Associated with Venous Thromboembolism (VTE),"Abstract 1238 

Background: SNPs within genes encoding factor XI ( F11 ), fibrinogen genes ( FGA , FGG ) and other candidate genes within the procoagulant, anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, innate immunity and endocrine pathways have been reported as associated with VTE. However, the independent risk of VTE associated with many of these SNPs after controlling for factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A and ABO blood group non-O carrier status is uncertain.

Objective: To replicate candidate gene SNPs previously reported as associated with VTE.

Methods: As part of a large replication study, we included 17 SNPs previously reported as associated with VTE in a custom Illumina Golden gate (total n=1093 SNPs) genotyping array. We genotyped 1270 non-Hispanic adults of European ancestry with objectively-diagnosed VTE (cases; no cancer, venous catheter or antiphospholipid antibodies) and 1302 controls (frequency-matched on case age, gender, race, MI/stroke status). Genotyping results from high-quality control DNA (SNP call rate â‰¥ 95%) was used to generate a cluster algorithm. The primary outcome was VTE status, a binary measure. The covariates were age at interview or blood sample collection, sex, stroke and/or MI status, and state of residence. To adjust for population stratification, we performed the multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) analysis option in PLINK v 1.07 to identify outliers in our population using the ancestry informative markers. We tested for an association between each SNP and VTE using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, stroke/MI status, state of residence and ABO rs514659 (in high linkage disequilibrium with non-O blood type). The analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using an extension of false discovery rates. The false discovery rate (reported as a Q-value) is an analogue measure of the p-value that takes into account the number of statistical tests and estimates the expected proportion of false positive tests incurred when a particular SNP is significant. All analyses were performed using PLINK v 1.07.

Results: MDS gave no evidence of population stratification. Genotyping was unsuccessful for two of the 17 SNPs. We found significant associations between VTE and SNPs in F11 , FGG , TC2D and FGA ( [Table][1] ). However, the false discovery rates for all significant SNPs except F11 rs3756008 were >0.05, suggesting that the observed associations were likely falsely positive due to multiple comparisons. Even at a false discovery rate of Q-value=0.0099, one would expect âˆ¼13 SNPs (0.0099 Ã— 1302 SNPs) to be falsely associated with VTE due to multiple comparisons. Consequently, even our observed association between F11 rs3756008 and VTE remains tentative.

Conclusions: We were unable to replicate reported associations between 15 SNPs and VTE. Our results emphasize the necessity of replication studies in different populations to confirm reported associations of SNPs with VTE.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs playing important roles in gene regulation. Different miRNA expression patterns have been described for DCM in humans and might represent potential diagnostic markers. There are no studies investigating miRNA expression profiles in canine DCM. The aims of this study were to Screen the miRNA expression profile of canine serum using miRNA microarray and to compare expression patterns of a group of Doberman Pinschers with DCM and healthy controls. 
Results: Eight Doberman Pinschers were examined by echocardiography and 24-hour-ECG and classified as healthy (n = 4) or suffering from DCM (n = 4). Total RNA was extracted from serum and hybridized on a custom-designed 8x60k miRNA microarray (Agilent) containing probes for 1368 individual miRNAs. Although total RNA concentrations were very low in serum samples, 404 different miRNAs were detectable with sufficient signal intensity on miRNA microarray. 22 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the two groups (p 1.5), but did not reach statistical significance after multiple testing correction (false discovery rate adjusted p > 0.05). Five miRNAs were selected for further analysis using quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR (qPCR) assays. No significant differences were found using specific miRNA qPCR assays (p > 0.05). 
Conclusions: Numerous miRNAs can be detected in canine serum. Between healthy and DCM dogs, miRNA 
expression changes could be detected, but the results did not reach statistical significance most probably due to the small group size. miRNAs are potential new circulating biomarkers in veterinary medicine and should be investigated in larger patient groups and additional canine diseases.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Carola Steudemann"", ids = ""5409421"")",,,,,
89d468e0ee8dea0112b4af67eab905c6da660931,"RNA-sequencing of the brain transcriptome implicates dysregulation of neuroplasticity, circadian rhythms and GTPase binding in bipolar disorder","RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technique to investigate the complexity of gene expression in the human brain. We used RNA-seq to survey the brain transcriptome in high-quality postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 11 individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD) and from 11 age- and gender-matched controls. Deep sequencing was performed, with over 350 million reads per specimen. At a false discovery rate of <5%, we detected five differentially expressed (DE) genes and 12 DE transcripts, most of which have not been previously implicated in BD. Among these, Prominin 1/CD133 and ATP-binding cassette-sub-family G-member2 (ABCG2) have important roles in neuroplasticity. We also show for the first time differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in BD. DE transcripts include those of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) and regulatory factor X4 (RFX4), which along with lncRNAs have a role in mammalian circadian rhythms. The DE genes were significantly enriched for several Gene Ontology categories. Of these, genes involved with GTPase binding were also enriched for BD-associated SNPs from previous genome-wide association studies, suggesting that differential expression of these genes is not simply a consequence of BD or its treatment. Many of these findings were replicated by microarray in an independent sample of 60 cases and controls. These results highlight common pathways for inherited and non-inherited influences on disease risk that may constitute good targets for novel therapies.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nirmala Akula"", ids = ""4064770""); list(name = ""Jennifer Joanna Barb"", ids = ""4925138""); list(name = ""Xueying Jiang"", ids = ""7325627""); list(name = ""Jens R.

2533fe50627b65baebdc4c88936f9350a8d1caba,Ambulatory Blood Pressure Is Associated With Polymorphic Variation in P 2 X Receptor Genes,"The P2X receptor gene family encodes a series of proteins that function as ATP-gated nonselective ion channels. P2X receptor channels are involved in transducing aldosterone-mediated signaling in the distal renal tubule and are potential candidate genes for blood pressure regulation. We performed a family based quantitative genetic association study in 248 families ascertained through a proband with hypertension to investigate the relationship between common genetic variation in the P2X4, P2X6, and P2X7 genes and ambulatory blood pressure. We genotyped 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which together captured the common genetic variability in the 3 genes. We corrected our results for multiple comparisons specifying a false discovery rate of 5%. We found significant evidence of association between the single nucleotide polymorphism rs591874 in the first intron of the P2X7 gene and blood pressure. The strongest association was found for nighttime diastolic blood pressure (P 0.0032), although association was present for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured by an observer during the day and at night. Genotypes were associated with a 0.2 SD ( 2.5 mm Hg) difference in night diastolic blood pressure per allele and accounted for 1% of the total variability in this measurement. Other suggestive associations were found, but these were nonsignificant after correction for multiple testing. These genetic data suggest that drugs affecting P2X receptor signaling may have promise as clinical antihypertensive agents.

The microRNA (miRNA/miR) microarray dataset GSE21036 and gene transcript dataset GSE21034 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following pre-processing, differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between samples from patients with primary prostate cancer (PPC) and metastatic prostate cancer (MPC) with |log2 fold change (FC)| >1 and a false discovery rate <0.05 were selected using the Linear Models for Microarray and RNA-seq Data 4 package of R. Next, a DEM-DEG regulatory network was constructed by downloading miRNA-DEG pairs from the miRNA.org database. Finally, functional annotation of each DEM-DEG module was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery based on the Gene Ontology database. The upregulated miRNAs, including miR-144, miR-494 and miR-181a, exhibited a higher degree of connections compared with other nodes, including in the DEM-DEG regulatory network, and regulated a number of downregulated DEGs. According to the functional annotation of the DEM-DEG modules, miR-144 and its targeted DEGs enriched the highest number of biological process terms (36 terms), followed by miR-494 (24 terms), miR-30d (18 terms), miR-181a (15 terms), hsa-miR-196a (8 terms), miR-708 (7 terms) and miR-486-5p (2 terms). Therefore, these miRNAs may serve roles in the metastasis of PC cells via downregulation of their corresponding target DEGs.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kai-min Guo"", ids = ""6520121""); list(name = ""Zuowen Liang"", ids = ""8090861""); list(name = ""Fu-biao Li"", ids = ""11430157""); list(name = ""Hongliang Wang"", ids = ""2468837"")",7aef91ca6af59337fb02074fa1c5a17ef0cc0cc1; a1dd79c11020c2397b9084f5c425f9f731ba8489; 38f11f12e1206b86b672e2b7ad3c6dad4c7227a1; 6f3b35ea77ea643ab8a3cd4328c0b8fec21072cd; 47568f773b07dd5b67709f4d72589e543f02914a,d74c743240529a3aa1fa931245db5140385526f4; 14a4b37a3739b98e18772e58a1fa8eded849aa98; 09eba357c710c8f9ff9f9124f788cc4852f66d53; 92a467204f8ab39318d755f195098eeaad82c126; ed34bdda11f149db63f4029d38552ebcfed0a5d4; 2d9c9e67757bdc34c34792b2c86497f510208201; 840bc3a33e54cc307a7c11abc287ed25391968a6; 5d4b042b98a935f2fa8d1fd4df4ac99b4a7a1fbf; 9834e494fe2aff28df5320500cd2277c87ff9397; 26dc461e343adb6b73aa412d85ab7023d156d359; b122bd85ad87f2b74495f1be519b3f163aa53a54; 703fec21e2bd80971d07afacc494e2f2b5033ee7; 1265088eca26e447366357d95bd601bb7123357c; 730f6ea347aade15b941cc6c35a5fe694bb924be; 069bee7a311f1ecdf9545a4c3e6c7515f1e14b0d; e2383a4c95eec9f22afccf8fa64fda8dbbe2d523; 10d84a75797dc9caeb4a39da3a6bafe87189998b; 93ad18158edb5941b9165b469a8c057bf9d7e060; db4a17adac8c61a1b54205ae296c5df45e6f8326; c719fa966b2c0c15bc698ab09c467ce1f44271c4; 000ffc8a24ddd59fd74cdee7275b78bdc6e7101b; 3c22f006ca6d2a9b7c3157d9b4e36934cc062bc9; edf1afc8152065e9a7dcee89e8a8df4f0da82347; e5e9098839cc999c1598e2788b9fb382b4aaed4b,Oncology letters,14 5,"

Osteoporosis can severely affect postmenopausal women, causing bone fragility and osteoporotic fractures. The aim of the current study was to compare blood mRNA profiles of postmenopausal women with and without osteoporosis, with the aim of finding different gene expressions and thus targets for future osteoporosis biomarker studies. Our study consisted of transcriptome analysis of whole blood serum from 12 elderly female osteoporotic patients and 12 non-osteoporotic elderly female controls. The transcriptome analysis was performed with RNA sequencing technology. For data analysis, the edgeR package of R Bioconductor was used. Two hundred and fourteen genes were expressed differently in osteoporotic compared with non-osteoporotic patients. Statistical analysis revealed 20 differently expressed genes with a false discovery rate of less than 1.47â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’4 among osteoporotic patients. The expression of 10 genes were up-regulated and 10 down-regulated. Further statistical analysis identified a potential osteoporosis mRNA biomarker pattern consisting of six genes: CACNA1G, ALG13, SBK1, GGT7, MBNL3, and RIOK3. Functional ingenuity pathway analysis identified the strongest candidate genes with regard to potential involvement in a follicle-stimulating hormone activated network of increased osteoclast activity and hypogonadal bone loss. The differentially expressed genes identified in this study may contribute to future research of postmenopausal osteoporosis blood biomarkers.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Katre Maasalu"", ids = ""6160260""); list(name = ""Ott Laius"", ids = ""47841074""); list(name = ""Lidiia Zhytnik"", ids = ""3966629""); list(name = ""Sulev KÃµks"", ids = ""4095225""); list(name = ""Ele Prans"", ids = ""4841174""); list(name = ""Ene Reimann"", ids = ""7605824""); list(name = ""Aare MÃ¤rtson"", ids = ""6377938"")",7e3d435071723efd6eba6643adba696311d87345,00eed1349839adaf0ee74db483b88dd165418729; f1ac055621e5c176a6948247d863f763df0c4cf2; fc3466c065ed185555a51d2416c423c9e94cd01b; 109634e223fb17bf86bb4464e087845e3ff83e0d; eb158ea9ab3228fd454657209dd820ba3cc22d26; ef803fd70af21369eb2eeb296ce740cc81484966; 33e3b6b820e03b4c929e1aa1e89904e312206f4d; 072281a1708e50442366b2c1e1f8429b1bd7b53c; 1d78c79033628f015e8977568849f137e55f1e15; c1e175241f603fae885eed2305289b0953ca6953; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; 425aab6fbf4cf21d6023d63527e7defe931b3822; 13c9948776c532766c35b3dea8486ee10a687bf8; 4b5cd12db6a255ce12cb92581776008394663386; e9407608b8955003e5a5d00c3bc7816d73d62922; 3e32980136df1a864a18fb7700de3f01f25c21f6; f0e4da9151686b3c72c9b03572d7d008c3d070f2; 54d0959e03fb5120b1fce491a85c87f1e8cc04a9; 3f503eb592c4c0db9667945c3d579c8087bd1676; 9f4f049db523e28301931742af3e7126eed01331; f22e37292ec29f732737a2fadaf89585a9947772; 138c5e1ef5c5af80a9afcb924834fe85ab6ef6af; e9670b4ea9612f964f953d6ea013c6f7683ce257; 9374121467d371493ea030a119f8461353496808; 3b4574870e53e73661932834ad421fb03a663179; 7285b1980dbec679a666b7e4c16e695f8d470421,Experimental Biology and Medicine,242,203 - 213
de74b7b657d76c9a38102bac0a06d26945d09fe7,Gene Expression Profiling of CD34+/Lin- Cells of Patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia at Diagnosis and after 12 Months of Nilotinib,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disease of stemming from genetic damage to a hematopoietic stem cell. Despite nilotinib being a very effective drug for the treatment of CML, drug resistance can emerge. In the contest of the REL-PhilosoPhi34 study on behalf of the Rete Ematologica Lombarda, we performed an exploratory study aimed to identify the gene expression signature of bone marrow (BM) CD34+/lin- cells of CML patients at diagnosis as well as after 12 months of nilotinib to investigate the genes and pathways responsible for the response or resistance to nilotinib. Microarray experiments were performed using the latest generation Affymetrix GeneChip HTA 2.0 to further investigate genomic complexity. The study was developed in two steps as follows: In the first step we analyzed 30 CML patients and from the comparison between the BM CD34+/lin- cell counts from each patient at diagnosis and after 3 and 6 months of nilotinib, patients were divided into 2 classes: class 1 (n=24) showed highly reduced levels of CD34+/lin- cells while class 2 (n=6) demonstrated increasing levels of CD34+/lin- cells after 3 and 6 months of nilotinib, respectively (Fig.1). The 30 patients can be divided into 6 groups showing different patterns of CD34+/lin- cellularity (Figure 1). Data was preprocessed and normalized using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm. The Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) was used to identify genes with statistically significant changes in expression in CML patients. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate. No transcripts were selected as differentially expressed using this threshold. However, if a nominal significance level alpha equal to 0.05 is adopted together with a fold-change threshold equal to 2 (absolute value), 56 transcripts were selected in the comparison between the 2 groups of CML patients. Among them, we focused on NFKBIAgene which was over expressed in class 1 compared to class 2.NFKBIA is involved in 68 pathways regulating apoptosis (PI3K,NF-kB) and encodes IkBÎ± protein belonging to the NF-kB pathway which is a potential downstream target of BCR-ABL1 due to its role in regulating cell survival and proliferation. Of note, 31/56 transcripts are located on chromosome 15 suggesting that this region could be crucial for transcriptional regulation of CML correlated to nilotinib response. The second step analyzed the GEP of CD34+/lin- cells of 8 patients at diagnosis (class 1) vs. the same 8 patients after 12 months of nilotinib (class 2) to investigate the gene expression changes and the pathways induced by nilotinib treatment. Data was preprocessed and analyzed as described above. 247 probes (corresponding to 51 genes and 180 non-annotated transcripts) were selected with a p-value lower than 0.05 after multiple testing correction and using a fold-change threshold equal to 3 (absolute value). Functional enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID and highlighted the following pathways and genes: Â¯ Defense response and immune system: CAMP, CRISP3, CYBB, RGS1, CEACAM8, LTF (cell growth and differentiation), MNDA and HP (positive regulation of apoptosis) were over expressed in class 2 with high fold changes of 7.65, 9.95, 4.40, 3.47, 4.28, 3.61, 3.60, 3.95, respectively Â¯ Transcriptional regulation and cell cycle: MMP8was under expressed in class 1 with the high fold change of 8,94 Â¯ S100A12, S100A8, S100A9 (regulation of the cell cycle and differentiation) were over expressed in class 2 with the FC of 8.68, 3.96, 4.49, respectively Â¯ RNA5S-ribosomal pseudogenes 310-311-312-313-314-315-316-317-320-363 were downregulated in class 2 Â¯ 10 small-nuclear-RNAs and 11 small-nucleolar RNA were differently deregulated between the 2 classes Â¯ APOC1, PLBD1 (lipid metabolism) were overexpressed and underexpressed in class 1, respectively In conclusion, this is the first study of GEP of CD34+/lin- cells with HTA 2.0 which demonstrated that 51 genes mostly involved in immune system, transcriptional regulation and cell cycle were significantly differently expressed from the comparison between CML patients at diagnosis and after 12 month of nilotinib. Ongoing studies are focused on examining the genetic and biologic mechanisms underlying nilotinib response or resistance to predict response or failure providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms in CML.

The aims of this study were to identify differentially regulated genes in the frontal cortex of sCJD and to profile the gene expression patterns in sCJD by using Affymetrix HGU133A microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The microarray data were generated by dChip and analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) software. A comparison between control and sCJD samples identified 79 upregulated and 275 downregulated genes, which showed at least 1.5- and 2-fold changes, respectively, in sCJD frontal cortex, with an estimated false discovery rate of 5% or less. The major alterations in sCJD brains included upregulation of the genes encoding immune and stress-response factors and elements involved in cell death and cell cycle, as well as prominent downregulation of genes encoding synaptic proteins. A comparison of the molecular subtypes of sCJD showed various expression patterns associated with particular subtypes. The range of the upregulated genes and the degree of the increased expression appeared to be correlated with the degree of the neuropathological alterations in particular subtypes.

541139e5991770016b9af936bf43f029ebbcfaa6,White Matter Differences Among Adolescents Reporting Psychotic Experiences: A Population-Based Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.,"IMPORTANCE
Abnormal brain connectivity is thought to have a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. White matter (WM) abnormalities have been reported in patients with schizophrenia and patients with prodromal syndromes. To our knowledge, no studies have yet reported on WM differences among adolescents who report psychotic experiences, a known vulnerability group for later severe psychopathology, including psychotic illness.


OBJECTIVE
To study WM differences using diffusion-weighted imaging (whole-brain and tractography analyses) in adolescents who report psychotic experiences.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
A population-based case-control study of 28 adolescents 13 to 16 years old who reported psychotic experiences and a matched sample of 28 adolescents who did not report psychotic experiences drawn from a sample of 212 young people recruited from primary schools in North Dublin and Kildare, Ireland. The study dates were 2008 to 2011.


INTERVENTIONS
High-angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging data were used to conduct whole-brain WM analysis using tract-based spatial statistics. Based on this exploratory analysis, a tractography-based approach with constrained spherical deconvolution was performed.


RESULTS
Compared with control group participants, adolescents who reported psychotic experiences showed WM differences bilaterally in striatal regions in proximity to the putamen (increased fractional anisotropy, Pâ€‰=â€‰.01, false discovery rate corrected), and tractography identified significant WM differences bilaterally in the uncinate fasciculus (increased fractional anisotropy in the right [Pâ€‰=â€‰.001] and axial diffusivity in the left [Pâ€‰=â€‰.01] uncinate fasciculus, respectively). Similar patterns of WM differences between groups survived adjustment for other psychopathology, indicating some specificity for psychotic experiences. Exploratory along-tract analyses showed WM differences between groups in the frontal projections of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (reduced radial diffusivity in approximately 32% of the tract segment [Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰.0001] and increased fractional anisotropy in approximately 16% of the tract segment [Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰.0009]).


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
In a population-based study of adolescents reporting psychotic experiences, we found a number of WM differences in the region of the putamen located between the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the uncinate fasciculus and in the left parietal regions that include the fiber bundle of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. These findings suggest that subtle structural changes to WM microstructure are not merely a consequence of disorder but may index vulnerability to psychosis even at a very early age.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Erik O'Hanlon"", ids = ""1397991964""); list(name = ""Alexander Leemans"", ids = ""144385759""); list(name = ""Ian Kelleher"", ids = ""2469810""); list(name = ""Mary Clarke"", ids = ""145304228""); list(name = ""Sarah M.

This study aimed to assess gene expression alterations related to T lymphocytes function and explore their potential association with hypoxemia among septic patients.


Methods
This is a retrospective cohort clinical study with laboratory investigations. We studied patients enrolled in sepsis biological specimen bank from Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, fulfilling consensus criteria for sepsis without any documented immune comorbidity admitted in ICU within 48 h after onset with whole blood samples drawn within 24 h of admission. Whole genome expression by microarray assay (Human LncRNA Microarray V4.0) was compared in hypoxemia cohort versus without. Differentially expressed (DE) genes with >1 log2[fold change (FC)] and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.20 that enriched in T cell related biological process entered the adjusted analysis to identify the candidate genes. The correlation analysis within candidate genes or with clinical parameters were performed. We assessed candidate expression ex vivo in co-culture system with RAW246.7 cells and validated genes identified in prior studies of sepsis-ARDS/hypoxemia within our present study.


Results
Septic patients (n=9) with hypoxemic phenotype held higher illness severity, serum lactate and creatine, and incidence of lymphopenia compared with non-hypoxemic group (n=6). Several gene signatures related to apoptosis, inhibitory receptors, T cell immunoreceptor, transcriptions factors, toll-like receptors and cytokine and effector molecules were upregulated in hypoxemic group. Candidate genes were identified after adjustment for age, sex and presence of lymphopenia with significantly negative correlations with partial pressure of O2 in an arterial blood (PaO2) and fraction of inspiration O2 (FiO2) ratio, among which NLRP3, SOS1, ELF1 and STAT3 held an increasing expression in ex vivo validation while the others, PSMA5, CLEC4D, CD300A, PRKD2 and PSMA2 showed the opposite alteration from those in vivo.


Conclusions
Higher illness severity and incidence of lymphopenia was observed following hypoxemia in sepsis and T cell-related gene signatures were associated with hypoxemia during sepsis.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ming Xue"", ids = ""46301030""); list(name = ""Shenmin Zhang"", ids = ""38654394""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Xie"", ids = ""49598464""); list(name = ""Xuesong Zhang"", ids = ""46447088""); list(name = ""Feng Liu"", ids = ""41209613""); list(name = ""Ying-zi Huang"", ids = ""49866679""); list(name = ""Ling Liu"", ids = ""51113671""); list(name = ""Songqiao Liu"", ids = ""2232963""); list(name = ""Fengmei Guo"", ids = ""39667135""); list(name = ""Yi Yang"", ids = ""47795676""); list(name = ""Weiping Yu"", ids = ""66725830""); list(name = ""Haibo Qiu"", ids = ""152674233"")",,,Annals of translational medicine,7 24,"

0ea29964e73eb8cb6ccf25dc429ca92d936fb29c,Putting on the squeeze,"Metabolomics can provide a better understanding of the state of cellular and biological processes at different stages of growth, under disease conditions, in response to stimuli, and even as a molecular signature for cell identification. The metabolome is thought to be the closest representation of phenotype and shows tremendous potential in applications such as understanding cellular processes in both normal and diseased tissues, environmental research, agriculture, biomarker discovery and personalized medicine. In spite of this, however, comprehensive data analysis and identification of the complex metabolite pool is still a challenge. One limitation is the sheer number of still uncharacterized metabolites â€” the small sizes of publically available spectral libraries, in comparison to the possible metabolite space, means that a high percentage of peaks remain unidentified in mass-spectrometrybased experiments. Another limitation is accurate statistical validation for largescale spectral assignments. Again, due to the high metabolite diversity, generation of a comprehensive decoy set to estimate the false discovery rate, which has been successful in the field of proteomics, is not feasible. Available approaches often require parameters to be adjusted for each data set (Nat. Commun. 8, 1494, 2017). However, progress is being made. Some of the new approaches for compound identification include integration of CSI:FingerID in SIRIUS4 (Nat. Methods 16, 299â€“302, 2019) for searching molecular structure databases, multi-level annotations using chemoinformatics strategies for carbon number determination and metabolite classification (Nat. Methods 16, 295â€“298, 2019), integrative metabolomics platforms such as MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (Nucleic Acids Res. 46, W486â€“W494, 2018), and metabolic reaction networkâ€“based annotation (Nat. Commun. 10, 1516, 2019). Creative applications and analyses include the use of metagenomics and genomescale metabolic models to aid microbiome modeling (Nat. Microbiol. 3, 456â€“460, 2018) and integration of metabolomics data with metabolic pathways for identifying metabolites affecting particular phenotypes (Nat. Biotechnol. 36, 316â€“320, 2018). The potential applications of metabolomics are only beginning to be fully explored. As researchers combine other -omics data and with more sophisticated study designs, the need for methods, both generalizable and specialized, will continue to grow. We look forward to further developments in the field. â",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nina Vogt"", ids = ""151451466"")",,,Nature Methods,17,24
5aeacb313257bb6d43cbc7eec8cf8470abe60a9a,"Stage-independent, single lead EEG sleep spindle detection using the continuous wavelet transform and local weighted smoothing","Sleep spindles are critical in characterizing sleep and have been associated with cognitive function and pathophysiological assessment. Typically, their detection relies on the subjective and time-consuming visual examination of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal(s) by experts, and has led to large inter-rater variability as a result of poor definition of sleep spindle characteristics. Hitherto, many algorithmic spindle detectors inherently make signal stationarity assumptions (e.g., Fourier transform-based approaches) which are inappropriate for EEG signals, and frequently rely on additional information which may not be readily available in many practical settings (e.g., more than one EEG channels, or prior hypnogram assessment). This study proposes a novel signal processing methodology relying solely on a single EEG channel, and provides objective, accurate means toward probabilistically assessing the presence of sleep spindles in EEG signals. We use the intuitively appealing continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with a Morlet basis function, identifying regions of interest where the power of the CWT coefficients corresponding to the frequencies of spindles (11-16 Hz) is large. The potential for assessing the signal segment as a spindle is refined using local weighted smoothing techniques. We evaluate our findings on two databases: the MASS database comprising 19 healthy controls and the DREAMS sleep spindle database comprising eight participants diagnosed with various sleep pathologies. We demonstrate that we can replicate the experts' sleep spindles assessment accurately in both databases (MASS database: sensitivity: 84%, specificity: 90%, false discovery rate 83%, DREAMS database: sensitivity: 76%, specificity: 92%, false discovery rate: 67%), outperforming six competing automatic sleep spindle detection algorithms in terms of correctly replicating the experts' assessment of detected spindles.",2015,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Athanasios Tsanas"", ids = ""2151583""); list(name = ""Gari D.

Introduction: Gene expression microarray analysis was employed to identify alterations that distinguish persistent from regressive bronchial dysplasia (BD). BD is a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and persistent BDs represent a high risk subset of these lesions. A potential role for promotion of genomic instability in persistence of BD is suggested by the overexpression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which abrogates G2-M checkpoint DNA damage repair, and epoxide hydrolase 3 (EPHX3), which converts tobacco smoke derived pro-carcinogens to mutagens.

Methods and Results: Sixty-three frozen baseline biopsies were classified, based on the presence or absence of BD in follow-up biopsies, into persistent BD, regressive BD, progressive non-dysplasia and stable non-dysplasia groups. ANOVA statistical analysis with a false discovery rate of 10% revealed 318 differentially expressed genes between persistent and regressive BD, whereas all other intergroup comparisons except persistent BD versus stable non-dysplasia revealed no or very few (<15) differentially expressed genes. This confirmed the unique biological nature of persistent BD. A pathway analysis using this genelist and employing IngenuityÂ© software revealed â€œmitotic roles of PLKsâ€ as having the most significant association with persistence. Based on their potential complimentary contribution to genomic instability, PLK1 and EPHX3 were further studied. Gene expression levels from all specimens with BD at baseline were used to classify biopsies as PLK1 and/or EPHX3 overexpressers based on expression levels greater than the mean expression for the gene. Using a histology score (1-8 for normal-SCC), a significant increase in outcome histology was noted in progressing from groups composed of cases without overexpression either gene, overexpression of one gene or overexpression of both genes (2.58 vs. 3.60 vs. 5.06 respectively). Validational analyses employing quantitative RT-PCR using cultures of 8 persistent BD and 6 regressive BD confirmed increased expression in persistent BD of PLK1 (2.77X, p=0.002) and EPHX3 (2.36X, p=0.081). Treatment of a persistent BD cell line with Volasertib, a specific inhibitor of PLK1, at 100nM showed potent inhibition of cell viability (live cell protease activity, 0.61 fold change vs untreated, p<0.05) and a strong trend toward increased apoptotic activity (caspase 3/7 activity, 1.71 fold change vs. untreated, p=0.076). Volasertib had no effect on these activities in cultured normal bronchial epithelial cells.

Conclusion: Gene expression analysis demonstrates the biologically distinct, high risk nature of persistent BD and suggests a potential role for overexpression of PLK1 and EPHX3 in the development of invasive SCC of the lung.

However, protein deduction is ambiguous due to uncorrected identified peptides and erased correlated information between peptides and their source proteins. Protein quality control methods can be divided into two categories: protein assembly and protein confidence evaluation. To date, parsimony principle, deriving the minimal proteins accounting for all identified peptides, has been widely used in protein assembly. Boolean and probability assembly are two kinds of methods in protein assembly. Protein confidence evaluation includes protein probability calculation of a single protein and false discovery rate estimation of all identified proteins. This review reveals the trend of developing a generalized probabilistic model with consideration of all influence factors, which can be applicable to a variety of peptide scoring system for protein identification.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Wu Song"", ids = ""46895558"")",,,Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics,,

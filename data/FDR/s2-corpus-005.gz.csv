fe9384f88a48854513edda501a64178ac5dca068,Extracellular Vesicles From Hepatocytes Are Therapeutic for Toxin-Mediated Fibrosis and Gene Expression in the Liver,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membrane-limited organelles that are liberated from their producer cells, traverse the intercellular space, and may interact with other cells resulting in the uptake of the EV molecular payload by the recipient cells which may become functionally reprogramed as a result. Previous in vitro studies showed that EVs purified from normal mouse AML12 hepatocytes (â€œEVNormâ€) attenuate the pro-fibrogenic activities of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a principal fibrosis-producing cell type in the liver. In a 10-day CCl4 injury model, liver fibrogenesis, expression of hepatic cellular communication network factor 2 [CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)] or alpha smooth muscle actin (Î±SMA) was dose-dependently blocked during concurrent administration of EVNorm. Hepatic inflammation and expression of inflammatory cytokines were also reduced by EVNorm. In a 5-week CCl4 fibrosis model in mice, interstitial collagen deposition and mRNA and/or protein for collagen 1a1, Î±SMA or CCN2 were suppressed following administration of EVNorm over the last 2 weeks. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that EVNorm therapy of mice receiving CCl4 for 5 weeks resulted in significant differences [false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05] in expression of 233 CCl4-regulated hepatic genes and these were principally associated with fibrosis, cell cycle, cell division, signal transduction, extracellular matrix (ECM), heat shock, cytochromes, drug detoxification, adaptive immunity, and membrane trafficking. Selected gene candidates from these groups were verified by qRT-PCR as targets of EVNorm in CCl4-injured livers. Additionally, EVNorm administration resulted in reduced activation of p53, a predicted upstream regulator of 40% of the genes for which expression was altered by EVNorm following CCl4 liver injury. In vitro, EVs from human HepG2 hepatocytes suppressed fibrogenic gene expression in activated mouse HSC and reversed the reduced viability or proliferation of HepG2 cells or AML12 cells exposed to CCl4. Similarly, EVs produced by primary human hepatocytes (PHH) protected PHH or human LX2 HSC from CCl4-mediated changes in cell number or gene expression in vitro. These findings show that EVs from human or mouse hepatocytes regulate toxin-associated gene expression leading to therapeutic outcomes including suppression of fibrogenesis, hepatocyte damage, and/or inflammation.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinlei Li"", ids = ""50080431""); list(name = ""Ruju Chen"", ids = ""7854127""); list(name = ""Sherri Kemper"", ids = ""9905380""); list(name = ""David R Brigstock"", ids = ""4704050"")",96afb7f30943f64c2f07046f975752e37523bc4a,bb4d3144b0ec653f167f1a64da8ed2ce4ab20456; b5c7e6ffc56ba0a513ac1c4f00602b09157ab10e; 4eb14711ce1b01db939dc1bc08a9e16504b02008; d1c7e1f8790738a9804a414cb661341b95187ccc; e89a5ad143153309b827ae1161a6aec32587dbe5; a7b21208258961d1305f999d10ef28e6cbb0ccec; f085072ba41403f7e8f4848bd6a631b8bcc675f7; 7ab36e38e009f2fb84d35eeb8bb8301f7720c3c5; 4a8b77db1da62d12415c9112777ac000412a9f29; 8d07ba5c2b961a4c5c5404d9d69418c140511513; e2e67ec2e39e9ab63a222a904867afaf2706c006; 0dd167bec9ba0a72e250f5b9eb6e6589ba33d3b2; 965486c7f7200ab4bedfdf0ce7c8588682987969; 3706c3f96646ff9abf7702fa0331d06f1c093f96; 32c404f0fba1b9d923905196a93663516ae38f1b; 5424fcd7a49d8993c4038d31a79e8b640b2602d6; e42e72ee65d261f35f174766d534c089d88a4a58; b7db749174306138d4ea95812a7368ae9cc675f8; cdbe8a265ef4bd8350722d2209fc6cc6290da1b3; 23e556c9c41177e6b5c7e93c4f05162625c49a53; 719ae37f781e8fc80317223d24f4325af3891615; 0a3bcc26c70d1fc8c1a03035e0187860e1afc8d6; e3f7ae16b1296942fd0208cb53235f7967b88a8c; f673c643a96adaf7b977b99b89749f38269f8a21; 442c465afc8ab39e72f3fea9615e47601f8b955c; bc20a9e1afc21bec51ff201b35fc534867a7ac7f; 80a84906bdfbf0de1333099010ef14d00f63c703; 13e18c07d6c386cdee1b9d07f88a8365347212b2; adfedbcc998981679d7e24fb2b61cc9b48cbe508; a581db5217b9014b9e706650d77400c70cb341f5; 34dad5f7231ed69fd5314cd40d50f291f30a2437; 9faf6449045c71125e28b709f8fb1bf50b1a4c13; 72c7814ff8a51b5dfb0f2ca9878353ad5539ee43; 58fef609a850ec9d13a997614b1daf0efe732563; 7b25ce33e7bf0ae5d0789a91d84adcfd5c457427; 833c7517ca5e1a5d589be7e6a623c370a68c5413; 097edf27e3f6797d8325ff7ec8ef23c903b91419; 72f481efae6686fa687c5e7f05a2a289d3319e4e; b4560caecdab978195aea83559644964b8a06310; 528b952d6d78fbb2cccf97aa40903e5d3c28041a; 7c50fa1bbe5bada4a0e00472f816c2ff1639770b; 8ba973c2a68df8df5eed37eb1f8a5429224bd19c; c79f83a060a9eee4355cf92367b10f6e83847372; d1ebfc0aabe8f97c853e8d557977a4fa52d88689; 71b5f12f2636798ee55bf8437da2ad3319a9bcd7; 2c359776886d551a956d7cc69f4b14f4f83ef6d7; 094195dbd146c4ade9b235ef1aa5816af0dd9544; 35d83b88e4364795b9c96ac8acc651c36fd0a64e; a44c95f49210e8c46bebdbb3c6a830d525a5d685; c96b97965cf59742d0cea36ae4697a9377c0f777; c7919bbfacdcd4a5c31fce6c4b0ae0f358b0bb76; 086eccc6ec2221823bf5b6d12bb93132702c3c05; 76c3ebbb08af5c4387eb4291fecc16e811c15538; 18477c37cd6d4e0000ccb97a058ec56d309dce28; 60a0c1d6e917d4d5fa49f0567e0bdc745ae439c3; c1115552b51ae6ebd2098947607174ed6c7a87dd; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; 59dd2b38c89ae5111c7b0828ebc01d0ec57fa738; bbc4615dc91899363ea3d6ac2b893b06fcb23bbb; 1c443040762744066ce36c444b8be4f646fe149e; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; c638438f407550a00223f3f9ef199c70b7351214; 45b2dcaa40c7a4289adcdeef6f6491b9e536c742; f1d3f62da77ecae32eca327c62276624e1d09613,Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology,7,
ca5e4b75f75cca3e54b3a3e5d1e213fcbba57839,PD-L1 Gene Alterations Identify a Unique Subset of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma That Harbors a T Cell Inflamed Phenotype,"Background: Programmed death - ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a dominant immune escape mechanism across human cancers. Ubiquitous copy gains of chromosome 9p24.1 - a region containing the PD-L1 and PD-L2 loci - lead to PD-L1 expression on Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. PD-L1 gene alterations also occur in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), albeit less commonly. Hypothesizing that PD-L1 gene alterations identify DLBCLs in which potent anti-lymphoma immune responses have been activated, we aimed to characterize the immune landscape of PD-L1 gene-altered DLBCLs, describe the key clinical features of these patients, and determine the degree to which PD-L1 gene alterations predict for response to PD-1 blockade therapy in DLBCL. Methods: FISH was performed on 105 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DLBCL specimens with DNA probes to PD-L1, a region centromeric to PD-L2, and centromere 9. Lymphoma-infiltrating T cell numbers (68 cases), HLA class I/II expression (74 cases), and PD-L1 protein expression (93 cases) were assessed by IHC. RNA sequencing (seq) was performed on FFPE samples utilizing the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Differentially-expressed genes were identified between PD-L1-altered and not altered DLBCLs using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 and log2 fold change of >1.5. Whole exome seq (WES) was performed on DNA from DLBCL specimens and 22 matched blood samples using the Illumina HiSeq exome kit in collaboration with Theragen Etex Bio Institute. Results:PD-L1 gene alterations were identified by FISH in 28/105 samples (27% - 16% relative PD-L1 copy gains, 7% PD-L1 amplifications, 2% PD-L1 translocations, 2% chromosome 9 polysomy), were enriched in non-germinal center (GC) DLBCLs (75% non-GC vs 25% GC; p=0.001), and were associated with robust PD-L1 protein expression (Fig 1A-B). PD-L1 gene-altered DLBCLs were more heavily infiltrated by CD8+ T cells compared to PD-L1 not altered DLBCLs (22.6 vs 13.8 CD8+ T cells/hpf; p Conclusions: Our results indicate that PD-L1 gene alterations identify a unique biological subset of DLBCL in which endogenous anti-lymphoma immune responses have been activated, and which is associated with responsiveness to PD-1 blockade therapy.

White matter network alterations have increasingly been implicated in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to identify shared and distinct white matter network alterations among the 3 disorders.


Methods
We used analysis of covariance, with age and gender as covariates, to investigate white matter network alterations in 123 patients with schizophrenia, 123 with bipolar disorder, 124 with major depressive disorder and 209 healthy controls.


Results
We found significant group differences in global network efficiency (F = 3.386, p = 0.018), nodal efficiency (F = 8.015, p < 0.001 corrected for false discovery rate [FDR]) and nodal degree (F = 5.971, pFDR < 0.001) in the left middle occipital gyrus, as well as nodal efficiency (F = 6.930, pFDR < 0.001) and nodal degree (F = 5.884, pFDR < 0.001) in the left postcentral gyrus. We found no significant alterations in patients with major depressive disorder. Post hoc analyses revealed that compared with healthy controls, patients in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups showed decreased global network efficiency, nodal efficiency and nodal degree in the left middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, patients in the schizophrenia group showed decreased nodal efficiency and nodal degree in the left postcentral gyrus compared with healthy controls.


Limitations
Our findings could have been confounded in part by treatment differences.


Conclusion
Our findings implicate graded white matter network alterations across the 3 disorders, enhancing our understanding of shared and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms across diagnoses and providing vital insights into neuroimaging-based methods for diagnosis and research.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Shuai Wang"", ids = ""1754710""); list(name = ""Gaolang Gong"", ids = ""40276414""); list(name = ""Suyu Zhong"", ids = ""5705959""); list(name = ""Jia Yong Duan"", ids = ""143624891""); list(name = ""Zhiyang Yin"", ids = ""4028266""); list(name = ""Miao Ying Chang"", ids = ""6007417""); list(name = ""Shengnan Wei"", ids = ""3916320""); list(name = ""Xiaowei Jiang"", ids = ""2385343""); list(name = ""Yifang Zhou"", ids = ""2647209""); list(name = ""Yanqing Tang"", ids = ""4287810""); list(name = ""Fei Wang"", ids = ""47939197"")",,90b8a06fbd491e7bf48f5c03da857fe817216940; d348358bfd7304462850564a3cd5385ed04e6f5b; 68d335c29a9e77f241a2f93d5c06cc40b3f315fb; ce70722f3cd889ae8212e8b3b710fa5382771ac0; d183aedcf542c2128461866e1cd004b4b3eecc9a; 99cfdf874012eef7d32fd281b5eed27c6be998d9; 6cea69fe045173b2ee4ba151fcd3d48614333b2c; 6c4f398ee72628487ee8e4fb0ffb6e0df79a5910; ac3856557c4b62c7fbb6e6de4e7ac24a5fe4f633; cf1113fd0ba60d1c3a185a746b74be79cbb3680d; 669543536735484a2b402d848ebf390e8b006402; ee2c79f90e1300671352395fb327f0aea25533e0; 0a03655f140fb958be04d2e4e1a7d73d3cf89f7c; fae49b0c2c4ce7d12a5d7ef8fd5a3cc04876f27b; 6746c42c3a17226a1c570022aeec9c3881cd9c03; d2fa569d3fbd72531d3f1eb7e462644fbd276859; 61eb7b453630ef09689583d25826aed928dd62b0; 1673a38aaa10c65cdc16015a3726f2b78be2c695; 5d88d96f401d8179550607812d0273bb638681a9; c03861d90fd46aa967d537704fc151b1495745b1; 884ce088ae7bae54602d982aeebfc3066d0ca5b6; 79b6680d346590801fe9b80522eff061b7bb2667; edeccfb7f72bfe1dea195d33c9e21ac9ceaa27fa; dcc48e07c8a105d855105a0bbf250d583268a0bc; 1bafa9a854e65791f411f9075a2f1c9c5e1322fb; 38c16aef5fe493ace913767806099da6cae80ba2; b62b03f17351c591a0a673d8570ebcbf3d1e43d7; 2c4f2a1d7b02dc0ed4d882eb22a13547e720776c; 2574c881787ed4dd0c9e03a406a8bb7e0978a2e8; 1be97fec0a3507e4a6da29c0b5bd8b9d7ed22aed; 59774f00898823649a6ec258fe6686bfd5f4683f; 23340bf94d49b0919a04d5f00bb2d6f4e9210424; 71a4d59e45a9133f78e09fb279b5bf251df21060; 3ee9d8bbddec0258ae3e01d2dbe6eed51b930f55; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; c2a488cd1953ce28ec752bfc492448396b815e93; 4c76a8407c822f317d6f9c7a3d0cd8c173a6dffa; e5bff81141dd62e4b3eb915f5191305f7a99f7b3; b55dfb180030e51e280c5660e7351bbaee7d2d19; ca030acb4a23806dc10a8202cd6a49cc6fed5998; 6daba82c3c5a466150c42854cc5987dca7aae602; 746da735ed418f51c02b05533d72a425bf7f9911; b5e0fdfefa2a3db2dbea6a1c66a7974511bedf5d; 1a40d5deb60e2701bc1709ed21c423dc6c57e46f; 616f43532516be934229b01751a597005cf05dbd; 2dc299c066101d247ea5ca76bb4053fb80414059; 81c032887eeb6154ffc898bfa71f2132a2227d6a; f66d14088bd0cccc24bf8391e12dcc60dac994fe; aa57f6775b7c1ec25b4a7703a187d7d426e2c166; 647acd47e4a3e66e24afba59d0d462981dcaea8e; 074ef7377bcd73bf61d9dd6e4f02a78fd5454017; b798e74cf8954daae13e4b31c4fed5f4a78035ec; 8e43db209c23a8b5ef1dfef06e042d588bee49a0; 0c33398980181e1ea5d1fed546d49490262ecb32; a47985a2f92d6dea018aaf582c075458d22c9c1f; da4401d6ed34eebb16a2e04f4e18b0104d2f5ac4; 49cd89bb4270c312ddd8f535764223112d1756ec,Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN,44 5,"

f3cbfaabe4ea6d9fe638973944fcbbfd6e4ef471,Differential protein occupancy profiling of the mRNA transcriptome,"BackgroundRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) mediate mRNA biogenesis, translation and decay. We recently developed an approach to profile transcriptome-wide RBP contacts on polyadenylated transcripts by next-generation sequencing. A comparison of such profiles from different biological conditions has the power to unravel dynamic changes in protein-contacted cis-regulatory mRNA regions without a priori knowledge of the regulatory protein component.ResultsWe compared protein occupancy profiles of polyadenylated transcripts in MCF7 and HEK293 cells. Briefly, we developed a bioinformatics workflow to identify differential crosslinking sites in cDNA reads of 4-thiouridine crosslinked polyadenylated RNA samples. We identified 30,000 differential crosslinking sites between MCF7 and HEK293 cells at an estimated false discovery rate of 10%. 73% of all reported differential protein-RNA contact sites cannot be explained by local changes in exon usage as indicated by complementary RNA-seq data. The majority of differentially crosslinked positions are located in 3â€² UTRs, show distinct secondary-structure characteristics and overlap with binding sites of known RBPs, such as ELAVL1. Importantly, mRNA transcripts with the most significant occupancy changes show elongated mRNA half-lives in MCF7 cells.ConclusionsWe present a global comparison of protein occupancy profiles from different cell types, and provide evidence for altered mRNA metabolism as a result of differential protein-RNA contacts. Additionally, we introduce POPPI, a bioinformatics workflow for the analysis of protein occupancy profiling experiments.

7fdc3ea85cf87d40ab866e6477d4b264577e2538,The Triform algorithm: improved sensitivity and specificity in ChIP-Seq peak finding,"BackgroundChromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is the most frequently used method to identify the binding sites of transcription factors. Active binding sites can be seen as peaks in enrichment profiles when the sequencing reads are mapped to a reference genome. However, the profiles are normally noisy, making it challenging to identify all significantly enriched regions in a reliable way and with an acceptable false discovery rate.ResultsWe present the Triform algorithm, an improved approach to automatic peak finding in ChIP-Seq enrichment profiles for transcription factors. The method uses model-free statistics to identify peak-like distributions of sequencing reads, taking advantage of improved peak definition in combination with known characteristics of ChIP-Seq data.ConclusionsTriform outperforms several existing methods in the identification of representative peak profiles in curated benchmark data sets. We also show that Triform in many cases is able to identify peaks that are more consistent with biological function, compared with other methods. Finally, we show that Triform can be used to generate novel information on transcription factor binding in repeat regions, which represents a particular challenge in many ChIP-Seq experiments.

7dcf3dc14895556796f13e0dcae681906047f64b,Self-report data as a tool for subtype identification in genetically-defined Parkinsonâ€™s Disease,"Through a targeted recruitment 23andMe has collected DNA and patient-reported symptoms from more than 10,000 subjects reporting a physician-verified diagnosis of PD. This study evaluated the potential of self-report, web-based questionnaires to rapidly assess disease natural history and symptomology in genetically-defined PD populations. While average age-at-diagnosis was significantly lower in GBA mutation carriers compared to idiopathic PD, or iPD (idiopathic PD, defined as no GBA mutations and no LRRK2 G2019S mutation), there were no significant differences in symptoms. Conversely, LRRK2 G2019S carrier status significantly associated with reporting of milder daily symptoms of lightheadedness and several differences were observed at a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.1, including increased reporting of changes in walking as an initial symptom of disease, decreased reporting of lightheadedness upon standing, and milder symptoms related to daily functioning. The subclinical differences in symptoms reported by LRRK2 G2019S carriers suggest differences in underlying pathophysiology and/or disease progression in LRRK2 carriers compared to iPD. Importantly, we confirm previous findings in PD genetic subsets where disease characteristics were ascertained through clinical exam. Overall, these data support the effective use of self-report and genetic data to rapidly analyze information from a large disease population or difficult to identify genetic subgroups.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashley R Winslow"", ids = ""3863624""); list(name = ""Craig L.

Peptides were filtered to ensure a 1% false discovery rate. A spectral counting approach was employed, using normalized spectral counts to minimize interpersonal variability. Statistically significant proteins (p 0.05) were identified, and analyzed by genome ontology to find overrepresented terms (p 0.0001) associated exclusively with adult and infant urines. RESULTS: A total of 672 proteins were commonly identified in both cohorts, out of 1321 total protein identifications. Between our data and contemporary adult proteomic studies, 222 proteins were identified in infants alone. The infant-specific proteome was overrepresented in cellular metabolic processes, gene expression, and RNA processing. In addition, among commonly identified proteins, several proteins associated with glycolysis and ROS were enriched in the infant. These include pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, Phosphoglycerate kinase 1, Aldose-1 epimerase, Retinal dehydrogenase 1, Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 and L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the male urinary proteome is highly age dependent, and hypothesize that the differences reflect differing growth and metabolic states between the adult and infant cohorts. These results highlight the importance of understanding the variation among non-diseased samples to better understand normal progression of the urinary proteome.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniela Flesch"", ids = ""52228076""); list(name = ""Elena Frerick-Ochs"", ids = ""1403936753""); list(name = ""CÃ©line M.

e0cdf5cc1a4991593aaf3352bb438d9081cd4081,The Genomic Basis of Postponed Senescence in Drosophila melanogaster,"Natural populations harbor considerable genetic variation for lifespan. While evolutionary theory provides general explanations for the existence of this variation, our knowledge of the genes harboring naturally occurring polymorphisms affecting lifespan is limited. Here, we assessed the genetic divergence between five Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for postponed senescence for over 170 generations (O lines) and five lines from the same base population maintained at a two week generation interval for over 850 generations (B lines). On average, O lines live 70% longer than B lines, are more productive at all ages, and have delayed senescence for other traits than reproduction. We performed population sequencing of pools of individuals from all B and O lines and identified 6,394 genetically divergent variants in or near 1,928 genes at a false discovery rate of 0.068. A 2.6 Mb region at the tip of the X chromosome contained many variants fixed for alternative alleles in the two populations, suggestive of a hard selective sweep. We also assessed genome wide gene expression of O and B lines at one and five weeks of age using RNA sequencing and identified genes with significant (false discovery rate < 0.05) effects on gene expression with age, population and the age by population interaction, separately for each sex. We identified transcripts that exhibited the transcriptional signature of postponed senescence and integrated the gene expression and genetic divergence data to identify 98 (175) top candidate genes in females (males) affecting postponed senescence and increased lifespan. While several of these genes have been previously associated with Drosophila lifespan, most are novel and constitute a rich resource for future functional validation.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Megan Ulmer Carnes"", ids = ""7022630""); list(name = ""Terry W Campbell"", ids = ""39254196""); list(name = ""Wen Huang"", ids = ""143664407""); list(name = ""Daniel G.

b613b57f05eac67d294c1d1cb0c5f70f48d8e04a,Longitudinal analysis of cerebral aqueduct flow measures: multiple sclerosis flow changes driven by brain atrophy,"Several small cross-sectional studies have investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and have reported mixed results. Currently, there are no longitudinal studies that investigate CSF dynamics in MS patients. To determine longitudinal changes in CSF dynamics measured at the level of aqueduct of Sylvius (AoS) in MS patients and matched healthy controls (HCs). Forty (40) MS patients and 20 HCs underwent 3T MRI cine phase contrast imaging with velocity-encoded pulse-gated sequence at baseline and 5-year follow-up. For atrophy determination, MS patients underwent additional high-resolution 3D T1-weighted imaging. Measures of AoS cross-sectional area (CSA), average systolic and diastolic velocity peaks, maximal systolic and diastolic velocity peaks and average CSF flow rates were determined. Brain atrophy and ventricular CSF (vCSF) expansion rates were determined. Cross-sectional and longitudinal changes were derived by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and paired repeated tests. Confirmatory general linear models were also performed. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. The MS population demonstrated significant increase in maximal diastolic peak (from 7.23 to 7.86 cm/s, non-adjusted p = 0.037), diastolic peak flow rate (7.76 ml/min to 9.33 ml/min, non-adjusted p = 0.023) and AoS CSA (from 3.12 to 3.69 mm2, adjusted p = 0.001). The only differentiator between MS patients and HCs was the greater AoS CSA (3.58 mm2 vs. 2.57 mm2, age- and sex-adjusted ANCOVA, p = 0.045). The AoS CSA change was associated with vCSF expansion rate (age- and sex-adjusted Spearmanâ€™s correlation r = 0.496, p = 0.019) and not with baseline nor change in maximal velocity. The expansion rate of the vCSF space explained an additional 23.8% of variance in change of AoS CSA variance when compared to age and sex alone (R2 = 0.273, t = 2.557, standardized Î² = 0.51, and p = 0.019). MS patients present with significant longitudinal AoS enlargement, potentially due to regional atrophy changes and ex-vacuo expansion of the aqueduct.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dejan Jakimovski"", ids = ""5855155""); list(name = ""Robert Zivadinov"", ids = ""2974446""); list(name = ""Bianca Weinstock-Guttman"", ids = ""1400467673""); list(name = ""Niels P Bergsland"", ids = ""2599672""); list(name = ""Michael G.

8e79d0ccd610bc5005124f8fe6b3a51abf878ed9,Identification of serum protein biomarkers for small cell lung cancer.,"e21005 Background: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality in the world. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression, extensive metastasis, and very high mortality (95%). The fact that SCLC prognosis improves when it is detected early underscores the urgent need for a non-invasive method such as serum protein quantification for timely diagnosis. Many researchers have tried to identify serum protein biomarkers for various diseases using a proteomics approach, but challenges such as low sensitivity of mass spectrometry, variable protein concentrations in serum, small sample sizes, and clinical confounding factors still exist. We hypothesized that integrative meta-analysis of a number of SCLC gene expression data sets would increase the sample size as well as address the issue of confounding factors, which in turn will allow us to identify serum protein biomarkers for SCLC.


METHODS
We performed meta-analysis on 9 SCLC gene expression data sets consisting of total 749 samples. We characterized the genes discovered from meta-analysis to identify candidate serum protein biomarkers and utilized ELISA to validate our in silico findings in human SCLC patient serum samples in vivo.


RESULTS
Meta-analysis of gene expression data revealed 100 genes (false discovery rate < 0.1) that are over-expressed in SCLC. These included not only ASCL1, a well-known neuroendocrine marker, but also possible drug targets such as HDAC1 and RXRG. We demonstrated that this meta-analysis approach is more successful at identifying over-expressed genes in SCLC compared to widely used Significant Analysis of Microarrays method. We selected a subset of genes from our initial genes based on their presence in serum, expression in SCLC mouse model, and potential involvement in SCLC pathogenesis. We are currently conducting ELISA of human SCLC patient serum samples to validate our predicted serum protein biomarkers.


CONCLUSIONS
Candidate SCLC serum protein biomarkers were identified using meta-analysis of gene expression profiles. The methods that we described in this study will enable us to discover serum protein biomarkers for other diseases and potentially apply them clinically for their early detection and better diagnosis in the future.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Youngsik Kim"", ids = ""49171324""); list(name = ""Purvesh Khatri"", ids = ""2102869""); list(name = ""Keon Min Park"", ids = ""10891799""); list(name = ""Jonathan Dudley"", ids = ""34753297""); list(name = ""Julien Sage"", ids = ""143682947""); list(name = ""Atul J Butte"", ids = ""50239137"")",,,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,29 15_suppl,e21005
5edc44e3531190b9336d4757dd3aea8547ad8f0c,VOLARE: Visual analysis of disease-associated microbiome-immune system interplay,"Background Associations between the microbiome and the immune system are well documented. However, elucidating specific mechanisms is an active research area. High-dimensional â€œomicâ€ assays such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and CyTOF immunophenotyping support hypotheses generation, identifying possible interactions that can be further explored experimentally. Linear regression between microbial and host immune features is useful for quantifying relationships between microbes and immune readouts. But, vetting dozens of significant associations can be cumbersome, especially when a project involves experts from different disciplines. In order to facilitate communication and sense-making across disciplines, we performed a design study for visual analysis of these relationships with a goal of helping researchers prioritize results for experimental follow-up. Results Using data from paired 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing and CyTOF immunophenotyping on gut biopsy samples from people with and without HIV, we fit a regression model to each microbe:immune cell pair, accounting for differences by disease status. We used permutation testing to control the false discovery rate, resulting in a â€œtop tableâ€ of microbe:immune cell pairs. After identifying essential tasks in the further analysis of this top table, we designed VOLARE (Visualization Of LinEar Regression Elements), a web application that integrates a searchable top table, a network summarizing this table, sparkline-inspired graphs of fitted regression models, and detailed regression plots showing sample-level detail. We applied this application to two case studies--microbiome:immune cell data from gut biopsies and microbiome:cytokine data from fecal samples. Conclusions Systematically integrating microbiome-immune system data through linear regressions and presenting the top table results in an interactive environment supports the Shneiderman mantra (â€œOverview first, filter, details-on-demandâ€). Our approach allows domain experts to control the analysis of their results, empowering them to screen dozens of candidate relationships with ease. Our contributions include characterizing the exploration of microbiome-immune system data in a team science context, and the support of an associated workflow by integrating existing visualization approaches.

4ca49cae193cf2189539ccd69130e16aab84f902,Cardiac Disease Status Dictates Functional mRNA Targeting Profiles of Individual MicroRNAs.,"BACKGROUND
MicroRNAs are key players in cardiac stress responses, but the mRNAs, whose abundance and translational potential are primarily affected by changes in cardiac microRNAs, are not well defined. Stimulus-induced, large-scale alterations in the cardiac transcriptome, together with consideration of the law of mass action, further suggest that the mRNAs most substantively targeted by individual microRNAs will vary between unstressed and stressed conditions. To test the hypothesis that microRNA target profiles differ in health and disease, we traced the fate of empirically determined miR-133a and miR-378 targets in mouse hearts undergoing pressure overload hypertrophy.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Ago2 immunoprecipitation with RNA sequencing (RNA-induced silencing complex sequencing) was used for unbiased definition of microRNA-dependent and microRNA-independent alterations occurring among â‰ˆ13 000 mRNAs in response to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Of 37 direct targets of miR-133a defined in unstressed hearts (fold change â‰¥25%, false discovery rate <0.02), only 4 (11%) continued to be targeted by miR-133a during TAC, whereas for miR-378 direct targets, 3 of 32 targets (9%) were maintained during TAC. Similarly, only 16% (for miR-133a) and 53% (for miR-378) of hundreds of indirectly affected mRNAs underwent comparable regulation, demonstrating that the effect of TAC on microRNA direct target selection resulted in widespread alterations of signaling function. Numerous microRNA-mediated regulatory events occurring exclusively during pressure overload revealed signaling networks that may be responsive to the endogenous decreases in miR-133a during TAC.


CONCLUSIONS

2cddbbdf1554b967f7c5a5d3cdbb9d62bf389f33,A Statistical Model to Investigate the Reproducibility Rate Based on Replication Experiments,"The reproducibility crisis, that is, the fact that many scientific results are difficult to replicate, pointing to their unreliability or falsehood, is a hot topic in the recent scientific literature, and statistical methodologies, testing procedures and p-values, in particular, are at the centre of the debate. Assessment of the extent of the problemâ€“the reproducibility rate or the false discovery rateâ€“and the role of contributing factors are still an open problem. Replication experiments, that is, systematic replications of existing results, may offer relevant information on these issues. We propose a statistical model to deal with such information, in particular to estimate the reproducibility rate and the effect of some study characteristics on its reliability. We analyse data from a recent replication experiment in psychology finding a reproducibility rate broadly coherent with other assessments from the same experiment. Our results also confirm the expected role of some contributing factor (unexpectedness of the result and room for bias) while they suggest that the similarity between original study and the replica is not so relevant, thus mitigating some criticism directed to replication experiments.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Francesco Pauli"", ids = ""6568300"")",,5618cd47f174c19f0f738fe947696d39cc3b114a; e578203c26f8a1e909e5d75c20bd1e16dddee03f; bfbcd0d4018f5755e25d65df3ac9ad3552542577; bcd2a1e2a53751ab3f3d312f0ec6da41a0628451; 26e44ff0a78cab3c7930594946ce07beebcd29e8; 1a46465ab69ec13d3c84d66166e979989afa596d; d38d49a182ac24f0ee26486705599eb823937377; abd6905fec5e1323dedb1311dbb7885e836c1877; 541d44f4542a241f7d42adcd723bf1b7ddab5b09; 3685e6f7e8817e91249332fc005951af1274044c; 1a81d3d1e8a983e0551edf485f4ac1a8cdd7fea4; 7c2b0044fb08a19d2eedce2ba8949cda22d888b0; 81a65f23474ffceb2481836328608102950da979; f9897ac92b276e3d7ddea11c6b48b8c3ae7dd309; bf1849fd8943754ae191cbbc62b296f70975d096; ff3e953c46a651a18a7ad1ebe299067498dd9b93; a07a64ba110e0f9f7156f3bd1e376f0d2e1cddf1; 8ef661183bed447fee57daf20caebf26bc2cd8d7; 48293c2bb4c1e1f6536d774b24a0ce6ed8815ccc; ed44accab4571065b3df1304f7c51183fe1ea506; ef160aee837c415ee3168efb0fe515ec2df5b2e8; 988dcf79f4f6fc3ab388bff29ace77da4edd995b; 0a89c7982f6cc71f298ee0d6f725e3ebe7744a89; 5157893bace99c321a9582c2df8b4df3ae48985a; b1c693783edf572c37ecbe3fc0508b44661a7b7e; 5f7ac26519a79effaa3476351a069587bc207b14; 649d8029842b8b08279c833d7247bfe56059ccea; 8aad4493a08b16c08d351f0b3d288fb0213fcb0c; 75309899d17c40e03689252377ccb308a7de70ed; 2cc7be3d5161e865807e13de7975c9d77fbd2815; 80017ce3173bfd1a467f0bd895f7c45a345f9c55; 3b84991c4b7e8d956ad72015091066055173284b; d0383326b54dbd083ecf88e6450ba73b46d3084e; 467a9791b5cdd72c18551445286735359a13801f; 2f8583a12390a0bedf0283a81bccf36ea247e5c0; f507a994c5609306b8e5c5fedf494420fc95411b; 97d9b9119bffc8b3bdd8859f88c52ead021a1b27; 114b18af06ccf88d87146116ebe0b37f525153bc; f1a76cbd7a9520867f4e347b09973a01aa9bd751; 1206a44458d84377633de9945cd5a7f465dc9168; 46d770c50ecbe2c08c640015f5d973e49539cfae; ba7684a2a2b46a1ed9fc5bc0d18bda2de4eb455e; f950263d9b00183a26334254d94216a647445ab9; 7dfba7e78c7f36658980f0bca7b8368bf4cfa84f; de91614b15f1faf330d44a6a16f7f9d681e30bb6; 1bc2bd69c22f7bccbb5e9729a0e24ba938bf2e29,International Statistical Review,87,68-79

The presence of a G Ã— E implies that the effect of an environmental variable (on phenotype) depends on genotype and vice versa and that the effect of genotype (on phenotype) depends on the environment. G Ã— E effects have been studied in psychiatry and psychology for decades using a variety of methodological techniques, reviewed here. The first of four sections in this chapter is the â€œIntroduction,â€ which provides a description of what G Ã— Es are (and are not) and how they have historically been studied. It also covers conceptual issues related to G Ã— E including geneâ€“environment correlation (rGE), the form of G Ã— Es, biological plausibility of various types of G Ã— Es, and epigenetics as it pertains to G Ã— E. Section â€œCurrent Issuesâ€ is focused primarily on the most common G Ã— E method currently employed: the candidate G Ã— E (cG Ã— E) approach, also known as the measured G Ã— E approach. A brief review of findings from the first decade of cG Ã— E research in psychiatry and psychology is provided. Evidence that raises questions about the validity of cG Ã— E findings is presented via discussion of statistical power, publication bias, and the estimated field-wise false discovery rate (FDR). Section â€œConclusionâ€ discusses the parallel course that G Ã— E research has taken with genetic (main effects) research. The final section â€œFuture Directionsâ€ briefly explains genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) and suggests the most promising avenues for future G Ã— E research.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Laramie E.

8420cbcbb6b9cbb43ccf36d5fe092bcce327fbf8,A pilot study identifying a potential plasma biomarker for determining EGFR mutations in exons 19 or 21 in lung cancer patients,"The most common type of lung cancer is nonâ€‘small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is frequently characterized by a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Determining the presence of an EGFR mutation in lung cancer is important, as it determines the type of treatment that a patients will receive. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to apply highâ€‘resolution metabolomics (HRM) using liquid chromatographyâ€‘mass spectrometry to identify significant compounds in human plasma samples obtained from South Korean NSCLC patients, as potential biomarkers for providing early detection and diagnosis of minimallyâ€‘invasive NSCLC. The metabolic differences between lung cancer patients without EGFR mutations were compared with patients harboring EGFR mutations. Univariate analysis was performed, with a false discovery rate of q=0.05, in order to identify significant metabolites between the two groups. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to discriminate between the metabolic profiles of the two groups. Furthermore, the significant metabolites were identified and mapped using Mummichog software, in order to generate a potential metabolic network model. Using metabolomeâ€‘wide association studies, metabolic alterations were identified. Linoleic acid [303.23Â m/z, (M+Na)+], 5â€‘methyl tetrahydrofolate [231.10Â m/z, (M+2H)+] and Nâ€‘succinylâ€‘Lâ€‘glutamateâ€‘5 semialdehyde [254.06Â m/z, (M+Na)+], were observed to be elevated in patients harboring EGFR mutations, whereas tetradecanoyl carnitine [394.29Â m/z, (M+Na)+] was observed to be reduced. This suggests that these compounds may be affected by the EGFR mutation.

cae93f6049371089cf220322dba4b7c85759505d,Plasma High-Resolution Metabolomics Differentiates Adults with Normal Weight Obesity from Lean Individuals.,"OBJECTIVE
This study explored underlying metabolism-related dysfunction by examining metabolomic profiles in adults categorized as lean, as having normal weight obesity (NWO), orÂ as having overweight/obesity.


METHODS
Participants (Nâ€‰=â€‰179) had fasting plasma analyzed by liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry for high-resolution metabolomics. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. NWO was defined as BMIâ€‰<â€‰25 and body fat >â€‰30% for women and >â€‰23% for men. Differentiating metabolomic features were determined by using linear regression models and likelihood ratio tests with false discovery rate correction. Mummichog was used for pathway and network analyses.


RESULTS
A total of 222 metabolites significantly differed between the groups at a false discovery rate of qâ€‰=â€‰0.2. Linoleic acid, Î²-alanine, histidine, and aspartate/asparagine metabolism pathways were significantly enriched (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) by metabolites that were similarly upregulated in the NWO and overweight/obesity groups compared with the lean group. A module analysis linked branched-chain amino acids and amino acid metabolites as elevated in the NWO and overweight/obesity groups compared with the lean group (all Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Metabolomic profiles of individuals with NWO reflected similar metabolic disruption as those of individuals with overweight/obesity. High-resolution metabolomics may help identify people at risk for developing obesity-related disease, despite normal BMI.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Moriah P Bellissimo"", ids = ""32854799""); list(name = ""Qingpo Cai"", ids = ""48141242""); list(name = ""Thomas R.

901746270e9cd4d4a11118b9d633961b8285bc92,Using controls to limit false discovery in the era of big data,"BackgroundProcedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) are widely applied as a solution to the multiple comparisons problem of high-dimensional statistics. Current FDR-controlling procedures require accurately calculated p-values and rely on extrapolation into the unknown and unobserved tails of the null distribution. Both of these intermediate steps are challenging and can compromise the reliability of the results.ResultsWe present a general method for controlling the FDR that capitalizes on the large amount of control data often found in big data studies to avoid these frequently problematic intermediate steps. The method utilizes control data to empirically construct the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and directly compares this distribution to the empirical distribution of the test data. By not relying on p-values, our control data-based empirical FDR procedure more closely follows the foundational principles of the scientific method: that inference is drawn by comparing test data to control data. The method is demonstrated through application to a problem in structural genomics.ConclusionsThe method described here provides a general statistical framework for controlling the FDR that is specifically tailored for the big data setting. By relying on empirically constructed distributions and control data, it forgoes potentially problematic modeling steps and extrapolation into the unknown tails of the null distribution. This procedure is broadly applicable insofar as controlled experiments or internal negative controls are available, as is increasingly common in the big data setting.",2018,Computer Science; Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Matthew M.

2d3b6b64d516a786b96b3299af25dde2b2eb3e5f,Amygdala Nuclei Volume and Shape in Military Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.,"BACKGROUND
The amygdala is a subcortical structure involved in socioemotional and associative fear learning processes relevant for understanding the mechanisms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research in animals indicates that the amygdala is a heterogeneous structure in which the basolateral and centromedial divisions are susceptible to stress. While the amygdala complex is implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD, little is known about the specific contributions of the individual nuclei that constitute the amygdala complex.


METHODS
Military veterans (nÂ = 355), including military veterans with PTSD (nÂ = 149) and trauma-exposed control subjects without PTSD (nÂ = 206), underwent high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans. Automated FreeSurfer segmentation of the amygdala yielded 9 structures: basal, lateral, accessory basal, anterior amygdaloid, and central, medial, cortical, and paralaminar nuclei, along with the corticoamygdaloid transition zone. Subregional volumes were compared between groups using ordinary-least-squares regression with relevant demographic and clinical regressors followed by 3-dimensional shape analysis of whole amygdala.


RESULTS
PTSD was associated with smaller left and right lateral and paralaminar nuclei, but with larger left and right central, medial, and cortical nuclei (p < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Shape analyses revealed lower radial distance in anterior bilateral amygdala and lower Jacobian determinant in posterior bilateral amygdala in PTSD compared with control subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
Alterations in select amygdala subnuclear volumes and regional shape distortions are associated with PTSD in military veterans. Volume differences of the lateral nucleus and the centromedial complex associated with PTSD demonstrate a subregion-specific pattern that is consistent with their functional roles in fear learning and fear expression behaviors.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rajendra A.

This percentage is called the false discovery rate (abbreviated ""FDR""), and it is an invariant (albeit, often unknown) quantity for any well-formed study. In proteomics, it has become common practice to incorrectly conflate the protein FDR (the percent of identified proteins that are actually absent) with protein-level target-decoy, a particular method for estimating the protein-level FDR. In this manner, the challenges of one approach have been used as the basis for an argument that the field should abstain from protein-level FDR analysis altogether or even the suggestion that the very notion of a protein FDR is flawed. As we demonstrate in simple but accurate simulations, not only is the protein-level FDR an invariant concept, when analyzing large data sets, the failure to properly acknowledge it or to correct for multiple testing can result in large, unrecognized errors, whereby thousands of absent proteins (and, potentially every protein in the FASTA database being considered) can be incorrectly identified.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Oliver Serang"", ids = ""48903708""); list(name = ""Lukas KÃ¤ll"", ids = ""2440976"")",15c416cfe44b602e2679b2386663d18d19dcab1d; 7668060b8205d67b3cf27be86771a3f2b1cf9ef7; ab8885a9ce8ded2ee1baaac33037739821c435b6; 1a949ee66b7ce451b560d2b08df0691d2d008f65; 5515b87cdcd50f4257c3fbf095cf8867c6eb1e38; 82bbf6174dc305846e5182164ec6507bc0cc6c72; 33bf2456e2bc2af50e7eed582f93b2861b91a19b; 7407cdb5c7cd2e1866a6aed8b4cb60a5e0dfd682; 948de9702c092b4a1c7d54c4415431b0fdd94d3f; dc7378445ce39e0fe17cdbbfbec631cf23e8e197; c49d8627c5ed0b57619fc190202170ea8f400467; 6721f735d4ba5f224c4bd88ca7c623c1171b2788; 4b113f05f949aacb1316203645db052caf8a9846; bdf941b1af86214a11872936138db1a4a9b65893; f86f77eb7144bd0ad5818b4520afa52c3a046279; 9152e95cf7bc61e60f22ebf682eaab06e95b006d; d3c9011c33a6121aa77bfa84586cf473050ea9e1; bbb9d827aec382175ebdadd291e7a3c0b4c651f2; f15b8582cefa3a564ecb6b3f52c8cf017f3d0348; 4330d47088d5ab60db7980db3c43221f2f06aa23; 27822318f2c8dbf5f92a4bd31d395bcca7db45cb; 46eec7f0283e99cee183283d2d783d066a4c3dc0; e74ee5153c097df3f6ca9c63a1dc193f60e01760; ea6c85fb540e426b6600fc61fdd46ce8b981ee5d; 5f1b968176937f79d8eb0c9252040b70ad05d51d,,Journal of proteome research,14 10,"

49294af439a14a0ba6f3404e6bf16d9204bdec8e,Immunophenotypic and molecular comparison between allogeneic and autologous graft-vs-host disease of the skin: A retrospective study using immunohistochemical and proteomics methods.,"To the Editor, Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), a potentially devastating complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), occurs when the transplanted immune system recognizes host tissues as being foreign and launches a cytotoxic immunologic attack, resulting in damage to affected tissues. Interferon-mediated processes are implicated in the early pathogenesis of GVHD. Although transplantation of autologous hematopoietic cells mitigates risk for GVHD, a syndrome resembling acute allogeneic GVHD may occur (autologous GVHD [auto-GVHD], auto-aggression syndrome and early engraftment syndrome). Although prior studies have investigated the role of T-cell immunity in auto-GVHD, this syndrome remains poorly understood and is somewhat controversial. It is conceivable that minor immunologic alterations in the host during conditioning or the graft during graft preparation may permit a GVHD-like phenomenon to unfold, although this hypothesis is unsubstantiated. We are unaware of previous work directly comparing the immunophenotypic and molecular profiles of allo-GVHD and auto-GVHD, and it remains unclear whether these represent identical biologic processes. We aimed to clarify the immunophenotypic and molecular relationship, if any, between acute allo-GVHD and auto-GVHD using immunohistochemical and proteomics methods. This study was approved by Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB14-001157). After obtaining institutional review board approval and an informed consent waiver due to the minimal risk nature of this retrospective study, we selected all skin biopsies with changes of auto-GVHD (1994-2012) and compatible clinical features, as per meticulous medical record review. We selected twice as many cases of acute allo-GVHD, matched by histopathologic grade. For controls, we used normal skin (re-excision specimen tips or biopsies with negligible histopathologic changes) from patients who had undergone HCT and never developed GVHD. Tissue samples were excluded if blocks were exhausted or if too few proteins could be identified. We used a laser capture microdissection-assisted liquid chromatography-based tandem mass spectrometry method modified from those described previously. Specifically, we mounted 10 Î¼m thick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin specimens onto polyethylene naphthalate membrane slides and stained them with Congo Red stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) for microanatomic visualization. We performed laser capture microdissection to isolate the mid-granular layer of the epidermis to the superficial dermis, and we dissected 1 000 000 Î¼m of tissue per case, using adhesive cap tubes for collection (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For quality purposes, we repeated analysis of all of the auto-GVHD cases, 1 of the allo-GVHD cases and 1 of the control cases. We recorded proteins that were differentially expressed (>20-fold expression; P < .05; false discovery rate <1%) between each comparison group. We also performed a limited panel of immunohistochemical staining to further explore the T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8 and FoxP3). We included 9 cases (allo-GVHD, n = 6; auto-GVHD, n = 3) and 3 controls (Table 1). The average number (range) of distinct peptides expressed was 8863 (5822-11 187) in the auto-GVHD group, 8304 (4024-11 873) in the allo-GVHD group and 5573 (4350-6536) in the control group. Table 2 documents the 12 proteins (0.3% of all detected) that were overexpressed in auto-GVHD compared with normal skin. Of these proteins, all (100%) were also overexpressed in allo-GVHD, as were 14 additional proteins (data not shown). No protein was underexpressed in auto-GVHD or allo-GVHD relative to controls. Each case showed vacuolar interface dermatitis, with histopathologic grade indicated in Table 1. Within the junctional and intraepidermal CD3-positive T-lymphocyte population, immunohistochemistry revealed a slight CD8-predominance over CD4, with a paucity of FoxP3 expression in all cases of auto-GVHD and allo-GVHD (Figure 1). Each of the 12 mutually overexpressed proteins fell into 1 of 4 biological categories: (1) interferon-induced, (2) antigen processing and presentation, (3) cellular adhesion or (4) response to cellular stress. The prominence of interferon-induced proteins and antigen processing and presentation identified in this study support the current understanding of interferon's key role in, and the importance of Received: 3 April 2017 Revised: 25 July 2017 Accepted: 6 August 2017",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Julia S Lehman"", ids = ""33579987""); list(name = ""Shahrukh K Hashmi"", ids = ""1760403""); list(name = ""Hillard M.

Since many life-shortening events are related to diseases, we developed a Mendelian randomization-based method combining 58 disease-related GWA studies to derive longevity priors for all HapMap SNPs. A Bayesian association scan, informed by these priors, for parental age of death in the UK Biobank study (n=116,279) revealed 16 independent SNPs with significant Bayes factor at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Eleven of them replicate (5% FDR) in five independent longevity studies combined; all but three are depleted of the life-shortening alleles in older Biobank participants. Further analysis revealed that brain expression levels of nearby genes (RBM6, SULT1A1 and CHRNA5) might be causally implicated in longevity. Gene expression and caloric restriction experiments in model organisms confirm the conserved role for RBM6 and SULT1A1 in modulating lifespan.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Aaron F.

0dc02b8ddfc9fea3d8833f72135ff4ef57761614,Identification of cis-regulatory variation influencing protein abundance levels in human plasma.,"Proteins are central to almost all cellular processes, and dysregulation of expression and function is associated with a range of disorders. A number of studies in human have recently shown that genetic factors significantly contribute gene expression variation. In contrast, very little is known about the genetic basis of variation in protein abundance in man. Here, we assayed the abundance levels of proteins in plasma from 96 elderly Europeans using a new aptamer-based proteomic technology and performed genome-wide local (cis-) regulatory association analysis to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL). We detected robust cis-associations for 60 proteins at a false discovery rate of 5%. The most highly significant single nucleotide polymorphism detected was rs7021589 (false discovery rate, 2.5 Ã— 10(-12)), mapped within the gene coding sequence of Tenascin C (TNC). Importantly, we identified evidence of cis-regulatory variation for 20 previously disease-associated genes encoding protein, including variants with strong evidence of disease association show significant association with protein abundance levels. These results demonstrate that common genetic variants contribute to the differences in protein abundance levels in human plasma. Identification of pQTLs will significantly enhance our ability to discover and comprehend the biological and functional consequences of loci identified from genome-wide association study of complex traits. This is the first large-scale genetic association study of proteins in plasma measured using a novel, highly multiplexed slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer) proteomic platform.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Anbarasu Lourdusamy"", ids = ""2423196""); list(name = ""Stephan Newhouse"", ids = ""11916869""); list(name = ""Katie Lunnon"", ids = ""3663629""); list(name = ""Petra Proitsi"", ids = ""4344333""); list(name = ""John Powell"", ids = ""145617453""); list(name = ""Angela K.

2407c9d6d4a485b07e656370adf6c65ef0af4b70,RNA sequencing analyses reveal novel differentially expressed genes and pathways in pancreatic cancer,"Gene expression microarrays have identified many tumor markers and therapeutic targets for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, microarray profilings have limited sensitivity and are prone to cross-hybridization between homologous DNA fragments. Here, we perform a transcriptome analysis of paired tumor and adjacent benign pancreatic tissues from 10 patients who underwent resection for PDAC. We identify a total of 2736 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with false discovery rate less than 0.05, including 1554 upregulated, 1182 downregulated, and 6 microRNAs (miR-614, miR-217, miR-27b, miR-4451, miR-3609, and miR-612). Overexpression of five DEGs, i.e. KRT16, HOXA10, CDX1, SI, and SERPINB5 in tumors is confirmed by RT-PCR in 20 additional tissues. Overexpression of KRT16 in PDAC is also verified on protein level. In addition, top canonical pathways such as granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis pathway have been identified. Our study represents a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC transcriptome and provides insight to the mechanisms of pancreatic carcinogenesis and potential biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yixiang Mao"", ids = ""8070875""); list(name = ""Jianjun Shen"", ids = ""2011557""); list(name = ""Yue Lu"", ids = ""33558846""); list(name = ""Kevin H.

301714d09e6e46f7d18bbf37433c894515f1c68a,Exome sequencing of 457 autism families recruited online provides evidence for autism risk genes,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically heterogeneous condition, caused by a combination of rare de novo and inherited variants as well as common variants in at least several hundred genes. However, significantly larger sample sizes are needed to identify the complete set of genetic risk factors. We conducted a pilot study for SPARK (SPARKForAutism.org) of 457 families with ASD, all consented online. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and genotyping data were generated for each family using DNA from saliva. We identified variants in genes and loci that are clinically recognized causes or significant contributors to ASD in 10.4% of families without previous genetic findings. In addition, we identified variants that are possibly associated with ASD in an additional 3.4% of families. A meta-analysis using the TADA framework at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 provides statistical support for 26 ASD risk genes. While most of these genes are already known ASD risk genes, BRSK2 has the strongest statistical support and reaches genome-wide significance as a risk gene for ASD (p-valueâ€‰=â€‰2.3eâˆ’06). Future studies leveraging the thousands of individuals with ASD who have enrolled in SPARK are likely to further clarify the genetic risk factors associated with ASD as well as allow accelerate ASD research that incorporates genetic etiology.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pamela Feliciano"", ids = ""5435958""); list(name = ""Xueya Zhou"", ids = ""48666991""); list(name = ""Irina Astrovskaya"", ids = ""1412744122""); list(name = ""Tychele N Turner"", ids = ""25968969""); list(name = ""Tianyun Wang"", ids = ""48469846""); list(name = ""Leo Brueggeman"", ids = ""2429171""); list(name = ""Rebecca A.

The ESPOIR cohort included patients aged 18 to 70 years who had a definitive or probable diagnosis of RA. Symptoms consistent with EAMs were collected at baseline. We divided the patients into two groups, with vs. without baseline EAMs. We looked for associations linking the presence of EAMs at baseline to patient and disease characteristics at baseline and 5 years later, as well as to diagnostic certainty after 2 years. The analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Of 798 patients, 330 (41.4%) had at least one symptom consistent with EAM at baseline, with the most common being sicca syndrome (28.4%) and Raynaud's phenomenon (17.3%). The EAM+ group had a higher mean baseline DAS-28 value (5.3Â Â±Â 1.3 versus 5.0Â Â±Â 1.3; corrected p valueÂ =Â 0.005) compared to the EAM- group. The final diagnosis did not differ between the two groups. After 5 years, the EAM+ group had significantly higher values for the tender joint count (3.9Â Â±Â 6.4 versus 1.8Â Â±Â 3.3, corrected p valueÂ =Â 0.005) and swollen joint count (1.3Â Â±Â 2.8 versus 1.1Â Â±Â 2.3, corrected p value =0.0005) compared to the EAM- group.


CONCLUSION
EAMs, particularly sicca syndrome and Raynaud's phenomenon, are very common in patients with early arthritis consistent with RA. In this population, several parameters reflecting disease activity were higher among patients with EAMs, at baseline and after 5 years.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dewi Guellec"", ids = ""4246373""); list(name = ""Servane Cozien"", ids = ""1498049684""); list(name = ""Adeline Ruyssen-Witrand"", ids = ""1395682379""); list(name = ""Philippe DieudÃ©"", ids = ""78469198""); list(name = ""Alain Saraux"", ids = ""113220904"")",,,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,,
205148aca4458dfa0b929beac9813fd1f33b131c,Atypical Antipsychotic Exposure May Not Differentiate Metabolic Phenotypes of Patients with Schizophrenia,"STUDY OBJECTIVE
Patients with schizophrenia are known to have higher rates of metabolic disease than the general population. Contributing factors likely include lifestyle and atypical antipsychotic (AAP) use, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify metabolomic variability in adult patients with schizophrenia who were taking AAPs and grouped by fasting insulin concentration, our surrogate marker for metabolic risk.


DESIGN
Metabolomics analysis PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four adult patients with schizophrenia who were taking an AAP for at least 6Â months, with no changes in their antipsychotic regimen for the previous 8Â weeks, and who did not require treatment with insulin, participated in the study. Twenty age- and sex-matched nonobese (10 subjects) and obese (10 subjects) controls without cardiovascular disease or mental health diagnoses were used to match the body mass index (BMI) range of the patients with schizophrenia to account for metabolite concentration differences attributable to BMI.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Existing serum samples were used to identify aqueous metabolites (to differentiate fasting insulin concentration quartiles) and fatty acids with quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography methods, respectively. To exclude metabolites from our pathway mapping analysis that were due to variability in weight, we also subjected serum samples from the nonobese and obese controls to the same analyses. Patients with schizophrenia had a median age of 47.0 years (interquartile range 41.0-52.0 years). Using a false discovery rate threshold of less than 25%, 10 metabolites, not attributable to weight, differentiated insulin concentration quartiles in patients with schizophrenia and identified variability in one-carbon metabolism between groups. Patients with higher fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 3 and 4) also trended toward higher levels of saturated fatty acids compared with patients with lower fasting insulin concentrations (quartiles 1 and 2).


CONCLUSION
Our results illustrate the utility of metabolomics to identify pathways underlying variable fasting insulin concentration in patients with schizophrenia. Importantly, no significant difference in AAP exposure was observed among groups, suggesting that current antipsychotic use may not be a primary factor that differentiates middle-aged adult patients with schizophrenia by fasting insulin concentration.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristen M Ward"", ids = ""7228752""); list(name = ""Larisa Yeoman"", ids = ""50857206""); list(name = ""Cora E McHugh"", ids = ""11401693""); list(name = ""A Zarina Kraal"", ids = ""144397433""); list(name = ""Stephanie A Flowers"", ids = ""40413050""); list(name = ""Amy E Rothberg"", ids = ""31622932""); list(name = ""Alla Karnovsky"", ids = ""2075842""); list(name = ""Arun K.

To investigate the differential expression of microRNA (miRNA) in colon between ulcerative colitis (UC) and ulcerative colitis related colorectal cancer (UCRCC).


METHODS
An UC mouse model was built by dextran sodium sulfate, and an UCRCC mouse model by dextran sodium sulfate and 1,2-diformylhydrazine. RNAs were extracted from the colon, purified and hybridized with fluorescence-labeled miRNA oligonucleotide gene chip. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to verify the expression variation of miRNA. SAM was employed for the data analysis.


RESULTS
The up-regulated miRNAs in colon cancer included has-miR-194, has-miR-215, has-miR-93, has-miR-192, has-miR-92a, has-miR-29b, and has-miR-20a (median false discovery rate<5%), while the down-regulated miRNAs were has-miR-1231, has-miR-195, has-miR-143, and has-miR-145 (median false discovery rate<5%).

For scanning statistics, due to local dependence, clusters of neighbouring hypotheses are likely to be rejected together. In such situations, it is more intuitive and informative to group neighbouring rejections together and count them as a single discovery, with the false discovery rate defined as the proportion of clusters that are falsely declared among all declared clusters. Assuming that the number of false discoveries, under this broader definition of a discovery, is approximately Poisson and independent of the number of true discoveries, we examine approaches for estimating and controlling the false discovery rate, and provide examples from biological applications.",2011,,"list(name = ""David O.

905a2d5140a54d79cd8d0fcbb57c3f534bd005ea,A panel of nine cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may identify patients with atypical parkinsonian syndromes.,"BACKGROUND
Patients presenting with parkinsonian syndromes share many clinical features, which can make diagnosis difficult. This is important as atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) carry a poor prognosis, compared with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, there is overlap between APS and dementia diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).


OBJECTIVE
To use a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to differentiate patients with APS from PD and dementia.


METHODS
A prospective cohort of 160 patients and 30 control participants were recruited from a single specialist centre. Patients were clinically diagnosed according to current consensus criteria. CSF samples were obtained from patients with clinical diagnoses of PD (n=31), PSP (n=33), CBS (n=14), MSA (n=31), AD (n=26) and FTD (n=16). Healthy, elderly participants (n=30) were included as controls. Total Ï„ (t-Ï„), phosphorylated Ï„ (p-Ï„), Î²-amyloid 1-42 (AÎ²42), neurofilament light chain (NFL), Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn), amyloid precursor protein soluble metabolites Î± and Î² (soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP)Î±, sAPPÎ²) and two neuroinflammatory markers (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and YKL-40) were measured in CSF. A reverse stepwise regression analysis and the false discovery rate procedure were used.


RESULTS
CSF NFL (p<0.001), sAPPÎ± (p<0.001) and a-syn (p=0.003) independently predicted diagnosis of PD versus APS. Together, these nine biomarkers could differentiate patients with PD from APS with an area under the curve of 0.95 and subtypes of APS from one another. There was good discriminatory power between parkinsonian groups, dementia disorders and healthy controls.


CONCLUSIONS
A panel of nine CSF biomarkers was able to differentiate APS from patients with PD and dementia. This may have important clinical utility in improving diagnostic accuracy, allowing better prognostication and earlier access to potential disease-modifying therapies.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nadia K.

48aa175135a93f94aa203573fe187c9cfc3318da,Method for assessing the statistical significance of mass spectral similarities using basic local alignment search tool statistics.,"A novel method for assessing the statistical significance of mass spectral similarities was developed using modified basic local alignment search tool (BLAST; Karlin-Altschul) statistics. In gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, many signals in raw metabolome data are identified on the basis of unexpected similarities among mass spectra and the spectra of standards. Since there is inevitably noise in the observed spectra, a list of identified metabolites includes some false positives. In the developed method, electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry-BLAST, a similarity score of two mass spectra is calculated using a general scoring scheme, from which the probability of obtaining the score by chance (P value) is calculated. For this purpose, a simple rule for converting a unit EI mass spectrum to a mass spectral sequence as well as a score matrix for aligned mass spectral sequences was developed. A Monte Carlo simulation using randomly generated mass spectral sequences demonstrated that the null distribution or the expected number of hits (E value) follows modified Karlin-Altschul statistics. A metabolite data set obtained from green tea extract was analyzed using the developed method. Among 171 metabolite signals in the metabolome data, 93 signals were identified on the basis of significant similarities (P < 0.015) with reference data. Since the expected number of false positives is 2.6, the false discovery rate was estimated to be 2.8%, indicating that the search threshold (P < 0.015) is reasonable for metabolite identification.",2013,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Fumio Matsuda"", ids = ""145339256""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Tsugawa"", ids = ""35451857""); list(name = ""Eiichiro Fukusaki"", ids = ""3979464"")",69b69ce4bfa50bd26a6871b085a18f64012fe101; 2b06a8fec9b1be23431b1fb603456156981fd87d; f98af7d12cbdee9d0dabfffb9ac5f0c53018be8a; 0da99eeb9db2650461ada8dadbe70076ad21bd92; 3c50a9ba3b79e6dd53a5abdc06834636deec0c0b; bd33247edc0092caa1d6dae573ed7aeff032a2d0; 6b139bb1eeafc2abb69da5c4319ee2fc33c60a55; b375f41750a04d1994487b79fe46a6f0df1a3bf0; 3b6de1d63114c05f89ac4e24b693393d9c0ebff8; ffcfda7141f159c7466eec94ee290e41e5c8e997; ce13d644c09f8594ad9bab908fd9ff9f6fecfc1a; 11086781ca25aa6b28e7ed80f10a0da5e1c15df2; 5e38220d6c78f0e3d0a62d45437076c3994bbc99,,Analytical chemistry,85 17,"

d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f,A comparative review of estimates of the proportion unchanged genes and the false discovery rate,"BackgroundIn the analysis of microarray data one generally produces a vector of p-values that for each gene give the likelihood of obtaining equally strong evidence of change by pure chance. The distribution of these p-values is a mixture of two components corresponding to the changed genes and the unchanged ones. The focus of this article is how to estimate the proportion unchanged and the false discovery rate (FDR) and how to make inferences based on these concepts. Six published methods for estimating the proportion unchanged genes are reviewed, two alternatives are presented, and all are tested on both simulated and real data. All estimates but one make do without any parametric assumptions concerning the distributions of the p-values. Furthermore, the estimation and use of the FDR and the closely related q-value is illustrated with examples. Five published estimates of the FDR and one new are presented and tested. Implementations in R code are available.ResultsA simulation model based on the distribution of real microarray data plus two real data sets were used to assess the methods. The proposed alternative methods for estimating the proportion unchanged fared very well, and gave evidence of low bias and very low variance. Different methods perform well depending upon whether there are few or many regulated genes. Furthermore, the methods for estimating FDR showed a varying performance, and were sometimes misleading. The new method had a very low error.ConclusionThe concept of the q-value or false discovery rate is useful in practical research, despite some theoretical and practical shortcomings. However, it seems possible to challenge the performance of the published methods, and there is likely scope for further developing the estimates of the FDR. The new methods provide the scientist with more options to choose a suitable method for any particular experiment. The article advocates the use of the conjoint information regarding false positive and negative rates as well as the proportion unchanged when identifying changed genes.",2004,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Per Broberg"", ids = ""1975483"")",9229513cf06cba98033da8be2a5956b566a72524; 0116ef322f3fc25e41ddb0df40aade428aad45d6; ef30fa57d674a86ad0c9950dc905c28215b424fa; ea9e87988f938fe7896b9ce102798e981a4a92b6; 69d6630f4dd2ad193b0a915f4881d528e3888832; c4c4c37534a49183354ebd8e4cd0e1cdc0201d4b; 3e9a554c9b5e4396e583d0695d4ff33b03e532c5; 50415aae8f524d573528d997c732fb3848875a80; b198ef350d69f521550ea6f187b89b06933f503a; f9084c9b61156a3ca6a5a6f8965a38bd7f0df980; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; 9b65736e1ee939ad806c383e8d60fe82b6e1f52e; 65c63d8a41f66a6f6fde19adf8d0b33fce6397ce; 73f77dc92c49ad3e580ec5d9d07e365e6432d755; b50bb17f35c6c1e10760698a6a2a65e0256fc23f; b4f9858e0c3239eedc2461af96d935cc5b501eb1; 84e034ebd3d51ad7a43b9ee7a05bdf9ddcee7564; 592e370fb566db967dc57a8e2e8979cb1d19dda3; 34382262d4407dbf2781acd514965b22c9350237; 211b078d6cc0314843943942165089752057325e; 0458c20aa03824b7e3259ad682fece40cec691b9; de97cffff0c12b11e4a90ea1feafac162667e2eb; ce6dd95f83a08ebc6a08d8ae23bf90ddd53a6c37; c2e54c8ef47668c415a4377a45b5b32b8d428127; 21e6ddaea5dd700a33eca5b97ce31a9bedfcf88a; b9c33773da6837f4d1db99c027ff33087f99e093; 0d7ee26e246fdd221ddb20119ec089d2827cdfab; 949225972b308425359ce046d5418c914288f66a; c985e871ea5647d070f1d2679e8ef5ce4a003ca3; 454eeb6e0e462bbdc2f65d67902497c63f7283e7; 81b701cffbe068270e50481a4c97a2d584c9ad52; 216f0709d3ad237819bc9b68f196c7ee0c6703a0; 88bb461f0b64f168f407c97ab76be5b605b25199; c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f; 522a22f15190643e99bdd4a14357665443216260; 8cd71d704f9d3eeb5eb697e412ba54b680f00636; aa13d40f3fd4b340f8005c1773bf675297e50f87; eb1d6c2599a6b0ad9e5d8198aa119af66f348834; e607e1bdeb46b315d0ccd01dcf26042d45fff1a1; 005cf60cb8ab68165bc15d0ac41eadf7bbf9ce38; 7d1f0557415e9cc6771e821ce5a491f32c9f522a; 56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68; fc1b970957fa6fd503de8573e4a505ffb12dc2fb; c5d09114433a2e1d10e188f03a8bac8fb5d9b987; 2444ef921fe84905f25a3e9a35c058fd7c0c9be2; 7a3754cf4d15203e3b10e1dadb1ccd11bddbf109; 96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3; f1e7570781fba2ac576049f589308fcf794ec768; 60ae6045db2712f8025402606dfc57b3ac2886de; bf28821922d50c5fb4f20176f29c3d1a647b0e0b; 7e1504bbd2af7ff9b7f4568f3d3ff5507112c2df; 3c651a9c19ec407ea3d696b9cc9f30d833e02f18; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; 883eeba3f42d2eabe9a19891468324e1e132e62d; 2337e35a29f0e051fa02952b27c97e1b4f25b984; 1c796e57afdadaadf935b0031c327a4158fca3d9; 258f84a676ad7a26fdb580a5cd5bff1f3121d3bc; 3302a1db213135f51e442f3b878fb1ce30dfba1f,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 514de7fd03e14cf5b557b859fddaab2277e45850; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; bf29dcd92f0f6b650196c8d8351fd0ef91e7701b; 65ba8fd8ef9c2a70cee99d2e5cab9302d0307a1e; e520cc396db99a52c1f0a67c0539b68f268f7669; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; feb457e2aab54077b0262c2e20b60f75b934841f; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; fdc2b0b00d520ab8d7c3fd20e0e2b763fa285503; 5d68ab1f666b53539e699734d91f4c138d97c79d; ee9ad5e8189b401cc8f4b17995d31c2e5de00cc0; 473aed5ddabee5daec75829b8e0e430da4e53019; d0a47c8c9c4213edd24a120a6912ebc08e348a19; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 16c9925285ff0e68e1eada904dfbfa850515b92e; 9f859afeaa8f3d62345217e102c965613b69edd4; f164e28a81d018dbe59d8ef5017cb9e9484c9316; 1a0efda6a3e104a4cafb4e64805e53c754a403dc; 5e7c395d1955c9a849cd901cfcc5d53452318f4b; 23f79cfe93bf751d09d2afa87e2b245a06e20017; 256f29267c2317228f6a7b65d698326f0a285e36; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b,BMC Bioinformatics,6,199 - 199
e81f1be87ca8efeff0c55ceb54d6ace4d7842185,Women with preterm birth have a distinct cervicovaginal metabolome.,"OBJECTIVE
Metabolomics has the potential to reveal novel pathways involved in the pathogenesis of preterm birth (PTB). The objective of this study was to investigate whether the cervicovaginal (CV) metabolome was different in asymptomatic women destined to have a PTB compared with term birth.


STUDY DESIGN
A nested case-control study was performed using CV fluid collected from a larger prospective cohort. The CV fluid was collected between 20-24 weeks (V1) and 24-28 weeks (V2). The metabolome was compared between women with a spontaneous PTB (n = 10) to women who delivered at term (n = 10). Samples were extracted and prepared for analysis using a standard extraction solvent method. Global biochemical profiles were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. An ANOVA was used to detect differences in biochemical compounds between the groups. A false discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
A total of 313 biochemicals were identified in CV fluid. Eighty-two biochemicals were different in the CV fluid at V1 in those destined to have a PTB compared with term birth, whereas 48 were different at V2. Amino acid, carbohydrate, and peptide metabolites were distinct between women with and without PTB.


CONCLUSION
These data suggest that the CV space is metabolically active during pregnancy. Changes in the CV metabolome may be observed weeks, if not months, prior to any clinical symptoms. Understanding the CV metabolome may hold promise for unraveling the pathogenesis of PTB and may provide novel biomarkers to identify women most at risk.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeny P Ghartey"", ids = ""6840673""); list(name = ""Jamie A.

c6b363ecb52142818fbd822d15796753468481e7,Neural correlates of working memory function in pediatric cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy: an fMRI study.,"The goal of this study is to investigate the neural correlates of working memory function associated with chemotherapy in pediatric cancer survivors using event-related functional MRI (fMRI) analysis. Fifteen pediatric cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and 15 healthy controls were studied. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI was acquired. A visual n-back task was used to test working memory function during the fMRI scan. Responses were recorded via an MRI compatible button box for analysis. fMRI scans were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping software. All statistics were corrected for multiple comparisons by false discovery rate, with p < 0.05 as significance. Patients however gave more incorrect responses (p < 0.05), more no responses (p < 0.05), and longer response times (p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. Correct responses generated significantly lower BOLD responses in the posterior cingulate for pediatric cancer survivors compared with controls (p < 0.05). Incorrect responses generated significantly greater BOLD responses in the angular gyrus in survivors (p < 0.05), and no response trials generated greater BOLD responses within the superior parietal lobule (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Working memory impairment appears to be due to an inability to manipulate information and to retrieve information from memory. The ability to delineate the affected neural circuits associated with chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment could inform treatment strategies, identify patients at high risk of developing cognitive deficits, and pre-emptively tailor behavioral enrichment to overcome specific cognitive deficits.",2020,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Patricia Stefancin"", ids = ""93339709""); list(name = ""Christine Cahaney"", ids = ""1596586765""); list(name = ""Robert I.

d1ec08382cf064ec828029c278734fead4818e51,Comparative proteomic analysis of rat hepatic stellate cell activation: a comprehensive view and suppressed immune response.,"UNLABELLED
Elucidation of the molecular events underlying hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is an essential step toward understanding the biological properties of HSC and clarifying the potential roles of HSCs in liver fibrosis and other liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma. High-throughput comparative proteomic analysis based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling combined with online two-dimensional nanoscale liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (2D nano-LC-MS/MS) were performed on an in vitro HSC activation model to obtain a comprehensive view of the protein ensembles associated with HSC activation. In total, 2,417 proteins were confidently identified (false discovery rate <1%), of which 2,322 proteins were quantified. Compared with quiescent HSCs, 519 proteins showed significant differences in activated HSCs (â‰¥ 3.0-fold). Bioinformatics analyses using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the 319 up-regulated proteins represented multiple cellular functions closely associated with HSC activation, such as extracellular matrix synthesis and proliferation. In addition to the well-known markers for HSC activation, such as Î±-smooth muscle actin and collagen types 1 and 3, some novel proteins potentially associated with HSC activation were identified, while the 200 down-regulated proteins were primarily related to immune response and lipid metabolism. Most intriguingly, the top biological function, top network, and top canonical pathway of down-regulated proteins were all involved in immune responses.

7b56fbc766f8cfedef5fa66c734ebe7f196891a9,"Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in EMR-linked pediatric cohorts, genetically links PLCL1 to speech language development and IL5-IL13 to Eosinophilic Esophagitis","OBJECTIVE
We report the first pediatric specific Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) using electronic medical records (EMRs). Given the early success of PheWAS in adult populations, we investigated the feasibility of this approach in pediatric cohorts in which associations between a previously known genetic variant and a wide range of clinical or physiological traits were evaluated. Although computationally intensive, this approach has potential to reveal disease mechanistic relationships between a variant and a network of phenotypes.


METHOD
Data on 5049 samples of European ancestry were obtained from the EMRs of two large academic centers in five different genotyped cohorts. Recently, these samples have undergone whole genome imputation. After standard quality controls, removing missing data and outliers based on principal components analyses (PCA), 4268 samples were used for the PheWAS study. We scanned for associations between 2476 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with available genotyping data from previously published GWAS studies and 539 EMR-derived phenotypes. The false discovery rate was calculated and, for any new PheWAS findings, a permutation approach (with up to 1,000,000 trials) was implemented.


RESULTS
This PheWAS found a variety of common variants (MAF > 10%) with prior GWAS associations in our pediatric cohorts including Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA), Asthma, Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) and Type 1 Diabetes with a false discovery rate < 0.05 and power of study above 80%. In addition, several new PheWAS findings were identified including a cluster of association near the NDFIP1 gene for mental retardation (best SNP rs10057309, p = 4.33 Ã— 10(-7), OR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.38 - 2.09); association near PLCL1 gene for developmental delays and speech disorder [best SNP rs1595825, p = 1.13 Ã— 10(-8), OR = 0.65(0.57 - 0.76)]; a cluster of associations in the IL5-IL13 region with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) [best at rs12653750, p = 3.03 Ã— 10(-9), OR = 1.73 95%CI = (1.44 - 2.07)], previously implicated in asthma, allergy, and eosinophilia; and association of variants in GCKR and JAZF1 with allergic rhinitis in our pediatric cohorts [best SNP rs780093, p = 2.18 Ã— 10(-5), OR = 1.39, 95%CI = (1.19 - 1.61)], previously demonstrated in metabolic disease and diabetes in adults.


CONCLUSION
The PheWAS approach with re-mapping ICD-9 structured codes for our European-origin pediatric cohorts, as with the previous adult studies, finds many previously reported associations as well as presents the discovery of associations with potentially important clinical implications.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bahram Namjou"", ids = ""152235987""); list(name = ""Keith Marsolo"", ids = ""1998251""); list(name = ""Robert Caroll"", ids = ""6984320""); list(name = ""Joshua C.

987a73c74f3fa8c466f7d626cdeaaa912339a6b1,Analysis of multiple exposures in the case-crossover design via sparse conditional likelihood.,"We adapt the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and other sparse methods (elastic net and bootstrapped versions of lasso) to the conditional logistic regression model and provide a full R implementation. These variable selection procedures are applied in the context of case-crossover studies. We study the performances of conventional and sparse modelling strategies by simulations, then empirically compare results of these methods on the analysis of the association between exposure to medicinal drugs and the risk of causing an injurious road traffic crash in elderly drivers. Controlling the false discovery rate of lasso-type methods is still problematic, but this problem is also present in conventional methods. The sparse methods have the ability to provide a global analysis of dependencies, and we conclude that some of the variants compared here are valuable tools in the context of case-crossover studies with a large number of variables.",2012,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marta Avalos"", ids = ""144150465""); list(name = ""Yves Grandvalet"", ids = ""1802711""); list(name = ""NÃºria Duran Adroher"", ids = ""3503471""); list(name = ""Ludivine Orriols"", ids = ""2656256""); list(name = ""Emmanuel Lagarde"", ids = ""3138920"")",8694e548a6d036df0c5573940cf39726ae39c9fe; 92d9586fe3a187b624f0d54f1dbd47307074c7ee; 82349055ac661cb6ef5893a83194e436d2cf584d; b9d2d47249aa19fb64d266a0dfe3962831459075; b99374266f939be567d63f94f8addb4caf77b499; 3416d31ffe106d5a34f7ede9353f97b03ca836d1,c74cb2dc88baec89af714577ddafa454ab785135; 6a276cd645a451ac2c6233c1fcf2a64137119100; 95dc9f19210c3ab703ad9bb61a1d02f9aa2a54b7; 2b3cc34afe36df6cc83c63744890b94d817e292c; e2e8d0d458c9030bf35b5fac3a2f9202a3ea4339; 96c5ebfcb1409b59323a56864991197c0fd5f719; 630cf3c2c591f6cfe0abb57dadd8c2b9f9362726; bfc871e0e727433cb9ad5c90bccc9291ae246f61; b042615ded5c38a6894d013966ad6195b914d8cd; 5481085e9529d8652b6b52073bb45189bfd227e5; 47c0b0b4d04aa22b38eb7c69a2db709c86be25d2; 6bbd914e2d3c60c5121cccfdaba32f81294daa24; 40124949fa97ac7eeb102e1879ae46976e0a2324; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; d4783d05ae9dd82a53883d33a767ef4ab0af789b; c4e8ca1586c917f9df0c7b51a9bb35aa7311cdf1; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; e703ccfa8c724b315eba0e358bb51c84abf81471; f70afeb2f0ad2d35ab1a254459e95a58732b09e1; b716d4fcab2a0508781d532a0663438c3d43c308; 411710aef0e1575934c314defbcd6212eaaf2022; e5ffaa4d7752d55cc5cf76eed1fec267b2db171c; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 3846d71fa1008abe0e367aad30e7675c71d734a9; 9799c3b81abaea78a9bb4e3ee417a6bd7bf7242c; 0aab42f5333cc1df7187a2dbea77aac6c3b5caec; 89b2416157ba0ff12569bfb732348c263499c957; 3352e59ce4a58e9f12e0942769c1fbd57319d5f2; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; 3b14e15f7a0fa64bdf6d501e66fb3fc31c900d63; 815f5280fa3c080533f1bfd7891268e61efb5bff; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; 33889980f6f8e05bf053eb0b5877ac35096aba2e; 5b730282bb28856bbda2c9886ec052e200eb6947; 756853af4ea0e890ac8c77a18df02d7ca9dd291f; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 3eed92865aaf61010ba59b469d681af34a59fc2d; dc4bf986066323fc927081676197650c494856b2; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; ef767b585b5d72e2194060060100d349b1f0486d; f889085bce18f2748ad083292ed096c915584053; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; f2cb402a7045b67a7540deab80cdbd8e1a52239d,Statistics in medicine,31 21,"

37cb0aaa0eda33b1fb984c5afdbc0ffaef28c313,Metabolic alterations in patients with Parkinson disease and visual hallucinations.,"BACKGROUND
Visual hallucinations (VHs) occur frequently in advanced stages of Parkinson disease (PD). Which brain regions are affected in PD with VH is not well understood.


OBJECTIVES
To characterize the pattern of affected brain regions in PD with VH and to determine whether functional changes in PD with VH occur preferentially in visual association areas, as is suggested by the complex clinical symptomatology.


DESIGN
Positron emission tomography measurements using fluorodeoxyglucose F 18. Between-group statistical analysis, accounting for the variance related to disease stage.


SETTING
University hospital. Patients Eight patients with PD and VH and 11 patients with PD without VH were analyzed. The presence of VH during the month before positron emission tomography was rated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory subscale for VH (PD and VH, 4.63; PD without VH, 0.00; P < .002).


RESULTS
Parkinson disease with VH, compared with PD without VH, was characterized by reduction in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose consumption (P < .05, corrected for false discovery rate) in occipitotemporoparietal regions, sparing the occipital pole. No significant increase in regional glucose metabolism was detected in patients with PD and VH.


CONCLUSIONS
The pattern of resting-state metabolic changes in regions of the dorsal and ventral visual streams, but not in primary visual cortex, in patients with PD and VH, is compatible with the functional roles of visual association areas in higher-order visual processing. These findings may help to further elucidate the functional mechanisms underlying VH in PD.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Henning Boecker"", ids = ""144069606""); list(name = ""Andres O.

eea6ffb4d39024291f041fb350e0d2da13f3a485,Comparing DNA integration site clusters with scan statistics,"MOTIVATION
Gene therapy with retroviral vectors can induce adverse effects when those vectors integrate in sensitive genomic regions. Retroviral vectors are preferred that target sensitive regions less frequently, motivating the search for localized clusters of integration sites and comparison of the clusters formed by integration of different vectors. Scan statistics allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and calculation of false discovery rates providing statistical methods for comparing retroviral vectors.


RESULTS
A scan statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window widths is proposed with software to detect clustering differentials and compute false discovery rates. Application to several sets of experimentally determined HIV integration sites demonstrates the software. Simulated datasets of various sizes and signal strengths are used to determine the power to discover clusters and evaluate a convenient lower bound. This provides a toolkit for planning evaluations of new gene therapy vectors.

0599fa120938410fb67bd04b97db6d3e441e7233,Glioblastoma: Vascular Habitats Detected at Preoperative Dynamic Susceptibility-weighted Contrast-enhanced Perfusion MR Imaging Predict Survival.,"Purpose To determine if preoperative vascular heterogeneity of glioblastoma is predictive of overall survival of patients undergoing standard-of-care treatment by using an unsupervised multiparametric perfusion-based habitat-discovery algorithm. Materials and Methods Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging including dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material-enhanced perfusion studies in 50 consecutive patients with glioblastoma were retrieved. Perfusion parameters of glioblastoma were analyzed and used to automatically draw four reproducible habitats that describe the tumor vascular heterogeneity: high-angiogenic and low-angiogenic regions of the enhancing tumor, potentially tumor-infiltrated peripheral edema, and vasogenic edema. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted to assess the prognostic potential of the hemodynamic tissue signature to predict patient survival. Results Cox regression analysis yielded a significant correlation between patients' survival and maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBVmax) and maximum relative cerebral blood flow (rCBFmax) in high-angiogenic and low-angiogenic habitats (P < .01, false discovery rate-corrected P < .05). Moreover, rCBFmax in the potentially tumor-infiltrated peripheral edema habitat was also significantly correlated (P < .05, false discovery rate-corrected P < .05). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significant differences between the observed survival of populations divided according to the median of the rCBVmax or rCBFmax at the high-angiogenic and low-angiogenic habitats (log-rank test P < .05, false discovery rate-corrected P < .05), with an average survival increase of 230 days. Conclusion Preoperative perfusion heterogeneity contains relevant information about overall survival in patients who undergo standard-of-care treatment.

We screened a microRNA (miRNA) microarray to identify potential serum biomarkers for BM in HCC patients. A miRNA microarray was used to screen for BM-related miRNAs in paired serum samples from HCC patients with BM and from HCC patients without BM. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify candidate miRNAs in serum samples from 106 independent HCC patients. Levels of candidate miRNAs in tissue samples from an independent cohort of 296 HCC patients were evaluated by in situ hybridization and intratumoral tissue microarray. The migration and invasion capabilities of HCCLM3 and SMMC-7721 cells were evaluated following treatment with a mimic and an inhibitor of miR-34a. Ninety miRNAs were differentially expressed in sera from HCC patients with BM when compared with sera from non-BM HCC patients (P < 0.05). Only miR-34a and miR-498 had false discovery rates (FDRs) < 0.05. In cohorts of 106 and 296 HCC patients, we found that reduced serum and intratumoral miR-34a expression levels were independent risk factors for developing BM. Migration and invasion experiments indicated that a reverse correlation existed between miR-34a and HCC tumor migration and invasion. This study demonstrates the potential for the use of miR-34a as a serum and intratumoral tissue biomarker for predicting the risk of BM in HCC patients.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zuo-lin Xiang"", ids = ""3773822""); list(name = ""X S Zhao"", ids = ""47039155""); list(name = ""Li Zhang"", ids = ""48570810""); list(name = ""Ping Yang"", ids = ""144418491""); list(name = ""Jia Fan"", ids = ""32641268""); list(name = ""Zhao-you Tang"", ids = ""4678065""); list(name = ""Zhao-Chong Zeng"", ids = ""1781820"")",9bfa09e1e27134ea37bbcd6162c5e9a96f7da70e; be7dd909a9339481485dcbbd6866e240e8c395de; 97a88d43ca86413f81ba7df7718ffd09fb32eaeb; 1b4d6b9fa2304a368485db9ff7a0f1d58589053c; 731c1e1e6f8a69cce2833090ad3032ba2b75565c; b572fa8c8767e54deb3b4490c627bd336094ff34; 88be86f85c79bb134647fdcaf879bfbe19adb9a9; 96944f98ac0887ac04bc6186b2ed9a197e6f906b; efcb20fc9ab7b4ded66520e5b19dcdcf2f719233; 80dd46dfc8792e1c2a01662fd341b8bbc6457b06; 607e8a58af95a3a69aa7daad86cd164789ab811a,cc41fe75118ee435dd3d01b71c563dbc81962327; 8ca41cca579a7bbe08c70a2183afdd577b6be658; 23ac16bdda0bf7d906f880ac7137423ed451f26e; 5c43d591fe7474103f38840a355ef36d76a7655a; bb9b58bea944a8b3ef09e435d9ea540b64259d1e; d7330bc002332ec1ff09406b24c3f462a3619354; 0726cc1af21d0cd52f094107d3fb3df50d2d5b4f; df63da75c3bc82c10e7b9e1080d42874442393cc; afebeb9b55392e04a5d83a359e7d23b2dfb7d15b; 7d03c4c7062c2b2d9c6560e7b7935c62fb3a4115; 112eb08a8a408c67e751f856787348676584c2e7; daa86b8443fb32850297feedc447727cb935a6c9; 766e0aa0c78df598a9cf83d060219780ae36631d; 7df8c133c431cdd36978407b9ad45c43e8c71149; 79987b6ca0e0fd1800f2da06336395f87282636b; 91a538f85714471951734fd4bc671a72bf1014bc; 679c83aed7697ad95bdbce18eeb80e71b7e525a9; 2475197cf82e66d248970fe740f3e730c9e18b81; dc68d9401c5fb153e6edcd87c640efc4c9965249; ef6ab0d37331bd9c085c905ccc10656a19951c70; dc18ae664f02df6090c9b3c9143856d605055bd8; fa8b3b9b23079b3039a9b0279f8f1bc154ea7c3c; 794b3c7a8767843ef60a0db6dbcc1e0f9b9b1ea1; 28093bf9d577dd1ef160c24076bc87251e1405a6; 134eb474ae6dccbed63ae8a9ab28a6bb41e78fd3; 11166302811ddf31daa0bccdc6d2f4fad11cc8a7; ed88572c24427efbf2976cb7d4ace5466aac6d4b; 16f2140a50d21f5b8b14952401e657ec2db21f06; 94c518caaa826159110f1d9fe7d79b88860f4a1e; 298fe34eaba5d5bb0e6972c828d7fdfd18367ccb; fa91827803b6c2ded231e578de069f0179da579e; e62607f99bf204ff55fc591828d7c7894746c002; f538da7e649555560e9949173f60cc00c9192805; 7588fe33671be01a5da24225e9353bdee4d1da12,Oncotarget,7,87246 - 87256
1e1f0f3f788c18672b81efd6c4aefd993acc7f98,Serum uric acid is associated with better executive function in men but not in women: Baseline assessment of the ELSA-Brasil study,"Background: Serum uric acid (SUA) may protect against free radical stress damage and was previously linked to cognitive impairment in older adults, but evidence in middleâ€aged adults is scarce. Purpose: We sought to analyze whether SUA is associated with cognitive performance in apparently healthy middleâ€aged participants in the ELSAâ€Brasil cohort study. Methods: We excluded participants older than age 65, those taking allopurinol, benzbromarone, or medications that could impair cognitive performance, those with previous stroke, and those with incomplete data on cognitive tests or SUA. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Memory Test (CERADâ€WLMT), the Semantic Fluency Test (SFT), and the Trail Making Test version B (TMT) were used as dependent variables. Sexâ€specific linear regression models were used to assess the association between SUA and cognitive tests, adjusted by age, education, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, coronary heart disease, renal function, depression, aspirin use, thyroid function, and menopausal status (in women). We used the Bonferroni procedure to control for the false discovery rate associated with multiple comparisons. Results: We analyzed crossâ€sectional data from 6751 women and 5464 men. Mean age and standard deviation (SD) of the sample was 49.6 (SD 7.4) years for men and 49.9 (SD 7.3) years for women. The majority of men (52%) and women (51%) were white. Mean SUA value was 4.75 (SD 1.16) mg/dL in women and 6.44 (SD 1.39) mg/dL in men. Multivariate linear models showed no association in women and a significant inverse association between SUA levels and TMT (&bgr; = â€ 3.106, 95% CI = â€ 4.594; â€ 1.618, p = 0.0004) in men. Conclusion: In a middleâ€aged subset population, SUA is associated with better performance on an executive function test in men, but not in women in the ELSAâ€Brasil cohort study.

d5dcd75aeb79a46da3b772281feb4ae1db18f0c8,Abstract PR05: The effect of chemotherapy on HER2+ breast cancer heterogeneity measured by STAR-FISH: Detection of PIK3CA mutation and HER2 amplification at single-cell level in situ,"Current therapies in HER2-positive breast cancer are effective in only a subset of cases and part of the resistance is attributed to single nucleotide mutation H1047R in PIK3CA . Conventional PIK3CA mutation detection methods require isolation of DNA from the tumor bulk, which requires relatively large amount of tissue and may not detect mutations in rare cancer cells. We developed a novel method, Specific-To-Allele PCR-FISH (STAR-FISH), which allows for in situ detection of point mutation and gene amplification at single cell level. The assay consists of in situ PCR steps with mutation specific primers, followed by hybridization of a fluorescently labeled DNA probe homologous to PCR primer overhangs and probes for genomic regions of interest. The STAR-FISH signals present in intact formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples are imaged and quantified in each individual nucleus within a tissue, with false discovery rate at 0.001, which facilitates identification of sub-populations of cells with different genetic makeup. The method was validated against FACS, immunofluorescence, droplet digital PCR, and MassArray; high correlation of the results was observed (R2=0.901 -0.9037, p We applied STAR-FISH for PIK3CA hot-spot mutation and HER2 amplification to FFPE samples of HER2 positive breast tumors from 22 patients. For each case a chemotherapy naive core needle biopsy and a post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy sample upon tumor resection were collected. STAR-FISH analysis was performed on 3-5 regions of each sample, to account for intratumor heterogeneity. Long-term patient survival data after adjuvant treatment, mostly with trastuzumab, were available for all the patients. High-sensitivity of STAR-FISH allowed us to detect rare single cells carrying PIK3CA mutation in most of the pre-treatment samples. After adjuvant chemotherapy the frequency of these cells was significantly increased. Since the STAR-FISH signals are quantified in each individual nucleus, subpopulations of cells with PIK3CA mutation or HER2 amplification or both features can be distinguished. Based on frequencies of cells within each of these subpopulations we calculated Shannon diversity index for each pre- and post-chemotherapy sample. The index was significantly increased after treatment. However, only topologic and not overall changes in diversity predicted poor long-term survival of the patients. In addition to analyzing the frequency of cells with PIK3CA mutation, HER2 amplification or both changes, STAR-FISH also assesses the spatial distribution of genetically distinct subtypes. We have found that cells with PIK3CA mutation, irrespective of their HER2 status, are much more dispersed within tumors after neaodjuvant chemotherapy, whereas cells with HER2 amplification and wild-type PIK3CA cluster together. These results suggest that PIK3CA mutant cells are more migratory and invasive, in agreement with prior studies of cell lines and animal models. STAR-FISH provides a unique view into genetic intratumor heterogeneity since thousands of cells within different regions of a single tumor biopsy can be analyzed within their tissue environment. Application of this novel in situ method allowed us to detect rare cells with PIK3CA mutation, pre-existing in the majority of treatment-naive tumors and increasing in frequency after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, STAR-FISH data revealed the correlation of chemotherapy-induced changes in intratumor heterogeneity with long-term survival of HER2+ breast cancer patients and support the significance of tumor diversity in situ analyses.

To assist in the identification of proteases, their endogenous inhibitors, and proteins that interact with proteases or proteolytic pathways in biological tissues, a dual-species oligonucleotide microarray has been developed in conjunction with Affymetrix. The Hu/Mu ProtIn microarray contains 516 and 456 probe sets that survey human and mouse genes of interest (proteases, protease inhibitors, or interactors), respectively. To investigate the performance of the array, gene expression profiles were analyzed in pure mouse and human samples (reference RNA; normal and tumor cell lines/tissues) and orthotopically implanted xenografts of human A549 lung and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas. Relative gene expression and ""present-call"" P values were determined for each probe set using dChip and MAS5 software, respectively. Despite the high level of sequence identity of mouse and human protease/inhibitor orthologues and the theoretical potential for cross-hybridization of some of the probes, >95% of the ""present calls"" (P<0.01) resulted from same-species hybridizations (e.g., human transcripts to human probe sets). To further assess the performance of the microarray, differential gene expression and false discovery rate analyses were carried out on human or mouse sample groups, and data processing methods to optimize performance of the mouse and human probe sets were identified. The Hu/Mu ProtIn microarray is a valuable discovery tool for the identification of components of human and murine proteolytic pathways in health and disease and has particular utility in the determination of cellular origins of proteases and protease inhibitors in xenograft models of human cancer.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Donald R Schwartz"", ids = ""152591123""); list(name = ""Kamiar Moin"", ids = ""4016843""); list(name = ""Bin Yao"", ids = ""144340823""); list(name = ""Lynn M Matrisian"", ids = ""144630289""); list(name = ""Lisa M.

We propose stageR, a two-stage testing paradigm that leverages the increased power of aggregated gene-level tests and allows post hoc assessment for significant genes. This method provides gene-level FDR control and boosts power for testing interaction effects. In transcript-level analysis, it provides a framework that performs powerful gene-level tests while maintaining biological interpretation at transcript-level resolution.

We investigated (1) whether combining the RNFL and GCIPL as a single layer (i.e. RNFL-GCIPL) for wide-field progression analysis outperforms wide-field progression analysis of the RNFL or the GCIPL, and (2) whether eyes with progressive RNFL-GCIPL thinning are at risk of visual field (VF) progression. DESIGN Prospective, longitudinal study PARTICIPANTS 440 eyes from 236 glaucoma patients; 98 eyes from 49 healthy individuals METHODS OCT RNFL/GCIPL/RNFL-GCIPL thickness and VF measurements were obtained at âˆ¼4-month intervals for â‰¥3 years. Progressive changes of the RNFL/GCIPL/RNFL-GCIPL thicknesses were analyzed over a wide-field (12x9mm2) covering the parapapillary region and the macula with Trend-based Progression Analysis (TPA) controlled at a false discovery rate of 5%. VF progression was determined by the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEAUSRES Proportions of eyes with progressive RNFL/GCIPL/RNFL-GCIPL thinning; hazard ratios (HRs) for development of VF progression RESULTS More eyes showed progressive RNFL-GCIPL thinning (127 eyes; 28.9%, 95% CI: 23.9%-33.8%) than progressive RNFL thinning (74 eyes; 16.8%, 95% CI: 13.1%-20.6%) and progressive GCIPL thinning (26 eyes; 5.9%, 95% CI: 3.7%-8.1%) over the study follow-up. Progressive RNFL-GCIPL thinning was almost always detected before or simultaneously with progressive RNFL thinning or progressive GCIPL thinning. The specificity of TPA for detection of progressive RNFL-GCIPL thinning, progressive RNFL thinning, and progressive GCIPL thinning was 83.7% (95% CI: 74.9%-92.4%), 94.9% (95% CI: 90.6%-99.2%), and 96.9% (95% CI: 93.5%-100.0%), respectively. Eyes with progressive RNFL-GCIPL thinning had a higher risk to develop possible (HR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-5.0) or likely (HR: 4.6, 95% CI: 1.5-14.0) VF progression, with adjustment of covariates, compared with eyes without progressive RNFL-GCIPL thinning. CONCLUSIONS Progression analysis of RNFL-GCIPL thickness reveals a significant portion of progressing eyes that neither progression analysis of RNFL thickness nor GCIPL thickness would identify. Wide-field progression analysis of RNFL-GCIPL thickness is effective to inform the risk of VF progression in glaucoma patients.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ken Wu"", ids = ""8890043""); list(name = ""Chen Li-n"", ids = ""2444462""); list(name = ""Alexander Lam"", ids = ""49221717""); list(name = ""Leo Ka Yu Chan"", ids = ""11188169""); list(name = ""Christopher Kai-shun Leung"", ids = ""5018865"")",,,Ophthalmology,,

Suter, Cristian Coarfa, Krithika Lingappan, Dimuthu Perera, Bhagavatula Moorthy, Kjersti M. Aagaard Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, Texas Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Houston, TX OBJECTIVE: Studies reveal that prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth. PAHs are generated through incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and are also found in tobacco smoke. In this study we utilized mass spectrometry and RNA-Seq in the placenta to measure alterations of the placental transcriptome with PAH exposures. STUDY DESIGN: PAHs were extracted from placenta (n1â„427) and analyzed via gas chromatography and mass spec (Agilent 7890A and 5975C). Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and Benzo[b] fluoranthene (BbF) quantification was performed using universal standards. RNA was extracted from the same samples, and utilized for RNA-Seq. DNA sequencing libraries were generated from the cDNA and cluster generation and sequencing was performed on the Illumina cBot station and Illumina Hiseq 2000. Sequenced reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38) with HISAT2 and assigned to genomic features with StringTie. Samples were stratified into high and low exposure groups based on mass spec results. Differential expression was determined using a parametric test and the R statistical system, and genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing corrected value < 0.05 were considered deferentially expressed. Gene set enrichment and ontology analysis was performed with GSEA. RESULTS: Levels of placental BaP and BbF were highly correlated (Pearsons r1â„40.954, p<0.001). Expression levels of 500 genes (p<0.05) were significantly changed (figure); 168 genes were upregulated, and 322 down regulated in the high exposure group compared with low exposure. Analysis of 1630 networks in GSEA revealed alterations in immune and inflammatory responses with PAH exposure (-4.17223 and -3.3718 respectively). Of interest, response to prostaglandins was significantly altered (-1.9667). CONCLUSION: We found significant correlations between PAHs in the placenta, which validates the technique as reports have shown that we are exposed to mixtures of PAHs through ambient air. The finding that the placental transcriptome is altered with PAH exposures requires further investigation in order to uncover mechanisms behind the adverse effects of PAH exposure in utero. PAH exposure has been associated with preterm birth, and follow up of these altered networks, including response to prostaglandins will help to further our understanding of these adverse effects.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa A.

Inherited genetic variants may influence the immune-inflammatory response in patients with compromised immune functions and may involve multiple signalling molecules reflecting the interplay of multiple genes. Using an extended candidate gene approach including pathway-analysis and protein-protein interactions we expanded our earlier study on mannose-binding lectin (MBL) polymorphisms to include 30 000 target SNPs within 900 candidate genes with possible relevance for childhood ALL. The candidate genes covered the following domains: i) pharmacogenetics, ii) immunogenetics, iii) apoptosis, iv) neurobiology, v) toxicity, vi) thrombosis, vii) cell cycle control genes, and viii) DNA repair and mitosis. We explored differences in host genomic patterns between patients with and without an infectious event during induction therapy. Material and methods: Included in our study were 72 patients aged 1.0 to 14.9 years diagnosed and treated for non-B ALL at the University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2000. The 7 weeks induction period (NOPHO-ALL 92 protocol) included oral prednisone 60mg/m 2 /d day 1â€“36/45, weekly i.v. vincristine 2mg/m 2 (6 doses), i.v. doxorubicin 40mg/m 2 (3 doses; 4 doses for the high risk groups), l-asparaginase 30 000IE/m 2 daily day 36â€“45, and age adjusted i.t. methotrexate (4 doses). Main endpoints in our analysis were â€œinfectious eventâ€ and â€œinfectious event with positive blood cultureâ€. Additional covariates included age, sex, risk group, immunophenotype, white blood cell count, and microbiological data. DNA library preparation was performed according to the SureSelect Target Enrichment System. Illumina GAIIx Genome Analyzer was used for sequencing. Associations were analysed by Fisher9s exact test implemented in PLINK. Only SNPs with observed minor allele frequency (MAF) above 5% and at least 50% of non-missing genotypes above 10 times the sequencing depth were used in the analyses. The obtained p-values were adjusted for multiple testing by means of adaptive permutation. The empirical p-values were generated by 1 million permutations of the test and were then corrected using false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. A set of high confidence protein-protein complexes was found. For association of protein-protein complexes similar methods were applied requiring at least 2 SNPs with observed MAF above 1% in at least 2 different genes of the complex. CART analyses were performed using R package applying 3-fold cross-validation using the genotypes of the SNPs associated with risk of infection and positive culture together with the clinical data. Only the SNPs with permutation corrected P-values below 0.01 were used in the analysis. Results: Of the 69 patients with appropriate DNA quantity, 48 (70%) patients experienced an infectious event. Of these, 23 (33%) patients had at least 1 positive blood culture during an infectious event which, among others, included 4 Pseudomonas, 4 Escherichia coli and 3 Candida infections. After correcting for multiple testing by means of adaptive permutation, a total of 103 and 94 SNPs were found to be associated with infectious event and positive culture, respectively (p 89% accuracy. Discussion/conclusion: Our data indicate that host genomic profiles can predict the risk of infectious events during induction therapy in children with ALL. Such knowledge might be helpful in adapting more individualised supportive care and treatment protocols.

a1bfdf9b159f0f522401ef8125907d2d03404448,Ion-current-based proteomic profiling of the retina in a rat model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.,"Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is one of the most common recessive human disorders and is characterized by multiple congenital malformations as well as neurosensory and cognitive abnormalities. A rat model of SLOS has been developed that exhibits progressive retinal degeneration and visual dysfunction; however, the molecular events underlying the degeneration and dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a well-controlled, ion-current-based approach to compare retinas from the SLOS rat model to retinas from age- and sex-matched control rats (n = 5/group). Retinas were subjected to detergent extraction and subsequent precipitation and on-pellet-digestion procedures and then were analyzed on a long, heated column (75 cm, with small particles) with a 7-h gradient. The high analytical reproducibility of the overall proteomics procedure enabled reliable expression profiling. In total, 1,259 unique protein groups, ~40% of which were membrane proteins, were quantified under highly stringent criteria, including a peptide false discovery rate of 0.4%, with high quality ion-current data (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio â‰¥ 10) obtained independently from at least two unique peptides for each protein. The ion-current-based strategy showed greater quantitative accuracy and reproducibility over a parallel spectral counting analysis. Statistically significant alterations of 101 proteins were observed; these proteins are implicated in a variety of biological processes, including lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, cell death, proteolysis, visual transduction, and vesicular/membrane transport, consistent with the features of the associated retinal degeneration in the SLOS model. Selected targets were further validated by Western blot analysis and correlative immunohistochemistry. Importantly, although photoreceptor cell death was validated by TUNEL analysis, Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses suggested a caspase-3-independent pathway.

Hence, we consider a mixture model to locate candidate genomic regions that are more frequently associated with gene expression traits. A modified two-sample t-statistic was used, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P-values <10-5 were considered for a subsequent two-component negative binomial mixture model. An expectation-maximisation algorithm was adopted to identify the parameters involved in the model. The SNPs were then ranked based on their false discovery rate (FDR) values. Any SNP with a FDR value <1% was considered as a potential hotspot. Three independent datasets were used to replicate the findings. A number of common hotspots were identified, and many hotspots have annotated function as the binding site of transcription factors or histone proteins.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Guanglong Jiang"", ids = ""2190079""); list(name = ""Yingqiang Fu"", ids = ""48467733""); list(name = ""Pengyue Zhang"", ids = ""47242980""); list(name = ""Shirin Ardeshir-Rouhani-Fard"", ids = ""150291295""); list(name = ""Lijun Cheng"", ids = ""49280525""); list(name = ""Lang Li"", ids = ""49192465""); list(name = ""Zhigao Li"", ids = ""4889834"")",,,International Journal of Computational Biology and Drug Design,10,108-122

Our work is motivated by an application to nationwide kidney transplant center evaluation in the United States, where the patient-level post-surgery outcomes are repeated measures of the care quality of the transplant centers. By taking into account patient-level risk factors and modeling the center effects by a finite Gaussian mixture model, the proposed model provides a convenient framework to study the heterogeneity among the transplant centers and controls the false discovery rate when screening for transplant centers with non-standard performance.",2020,Medicine; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Lanfeng Pan"", ids = ""3077236""); list(name = ""Yehua Li"", ids = ""50023967""); list(name = ""Kevin He"", ids = ""145993397""); list(name = ""Yanming Li"", ids = ""50025666""); list(name = ""Yi Li"", ids = ""47002715"")",,284a0abb2292c067ab265c6e60ef4fa0d956a32d; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; c4913a53dbb0596799f38a8319d210f663fd7582; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; 9871c9dce9887bf4798b5cd0a6aab34c3363b898; 956907707a9d77465ebcda8dbfd0940a2b4c6fc6; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; da1d2e8a5d03c48cdcd854742343bb0a7718440f; b63b551c883c815ca47a05e98686e87b8bb66700; 4b9d66929170a317ee2a35dae30a5b6e97e3d14d; 693e1736e3842a54b3a8b02d235b76f556c44781; 70c3cad8c49d7e0316107fcbbd239019225a5eb4; c96fd6ae009549786bea7ed13c061816e7b4120d; 14621e00b8ec7399f4f17cddd69c4e3b2dafda7d; b7365577dec682c424d10d09555d42ddd0b755d8; 3707330e91c8a164ef398605f3e9d57f221db889; dfd8b5c050180719324c32bf7c9e9987e5947e30; 49d7bd63ee411d55466018e70a6ff8ee4c1346f8; 4da0fd7ffb45d265ea8c247af239351ee4d4c047; e01bf2c4aeabe3b101a08e2c805b070cd25fadc9; 400b45a803d642b752a84147ef547af7811e8f3f; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 0699b1d7eec6ab2c12563e66a264cc9244bbb28c; f4f37e529ae74ae5cbf68eb9b326ea470574f770; 4aaee677051150e030de8ce2cce42bfc76297b0c; c6903d2703142a82228fcc8baad0e02c5e7da646; 3ce59d56f36dd164185e554a0666719a578bb3b5; 1086643c453895287174269eb2121491ef270c75; cec775be96a4cedc1982a58ff1b3b07cf33aa214; 4b4e2994c1d680f5ede86efd899fab9762903a75; 5412be7581819cd36d5123ab7571f336753472e3; 1a0de4962354bde9644e0c513400b968241a40ed; 2d573a9b4def8b92daa2ae63f1639091fc728ed6,Journal of multivariate analysis,175,

Our methodology consists of a new criterion, the excess discovery count (EDC), and a new class of testing procedures that we call alpha-investing rules. The excess discovery count is the difference between the number of correctly rejected null hypotheses and a fraction of the total number of rejected hypotheses. EDC shares many properties with the false discovery rate (FDR), but is adapted to testing a sequence of hypotheses rather than a fixed set. Because EDC controls the count of incorrectly rejected hypotheses rather than a ratio, we are able to prove that a wide class of testing procedures that we call alpha-investing rules control EDC. Alpha-investing rules mimic alpha-spending rules used in sequential trials, but possess a key difference. When a test rejects a null hypothesis, alpha-investing rules earn additional probability toward testing subsequent hypotheses. Alpha-investing rules allow one to incorporate domain knowledge into the testing procedure and improve the power of the tests.",2005,,"list(name = ""Dean P.

Such calculation should be derived from the comparison of existing methods in a large benchmark set of sequences, as it was the case in this study. In the present study 22 primer design tools were compared based on the deviation of the predicted T m values of 158 primers using software versus the experimentally determined T m values. A paired t-test (False discovery rate (FDR) corrected P-values) and mean square deviation (MSD) were applied to assess all software packages. A significant variation was observed for the T m values of primers calculated by different tools in comparison with optimal experimental condition, which could end up causing wide error in amplification reactions. Based on FDR and MSD criteria, Primer3 Plus and Primer-BLAST performed the best prediction of T m . We practically aimed to provide an easy, safe and robust application of the current available T m predictor tools for all researchers especially for premiers to help them increase their success in different PCR and real-time PCR applications.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mohammad Reza Bakhtiarizadeh"", ids = ""5408165""); list(name = ""Mohammad Javad Najafpanah"", ids = ""5266626""); list(name = ""Hojatollah Mousapour"", ids = ""14626943""); list(name = ""Seyed Alireza Salami"", ids = ""8893353"")",961206c23eefba61c2f8d2e46aabff525a9d5940; 066a1ff043ada6116454482bd6d9370c857a8913,,Gene Reports,2,1-3
18a54d66044d449c3af9533199482420821e4445,Two-stage analysis for selecting fixed numbers of features in omics association studies.,"One of main roles of omics-based association studies with high-throughput technologies is to screen out relevant molecular features, such as genetic variants, genes, and proteins, from a large pool of such candidate features based on their associations with the phenotype of interest. Typically, screened features are subject to validation studies using more established or conventional assays, where the number of evaluable features is relatively limited, so that there may exist a fixed number of features measurable by these assays. Such a limitation necessitates narrowing a feature set down to a fixed size, following an initial screening analysis via multiple testing where adjustment for multiplicity is made. We propose a two-stage screening approach to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for a feature set with fixed size that is subject to validation studies, rather than for a feature set from the initial screening analysis. Out of the feature set selected in the first stage with a relaxed FDR level, a fraction of features with most statistical significance is firstly selected. For the remaining feature set, features are selected based on biological consideration only, without regard to any statistical information, which allows evaluating the FDR level for the finally selected feature set with fixed size. Improvement of the power is discussed in the proposed two-stage screening approach. Simulation experiments based on parametric models and real microarray datasets demonstrated substantial increment in the number of screened features for biological consideration compared with the standard screening approach, allowing for more extensive and in-depth biological investigations in omics association studies.",2019,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Takanori Kawabata"", ids = ""153292183""); list(name = ""Ryo Emoto"", ids = ""88963238""); list(name = ""Jo Nishino"", ids = ""1699863""); list(name = ""Kunihiko Takahashi"", ids = ""143877250""); list(name = ""Shigeyuki Matsui"", ids = ""1687379"")",,,Statistics in medicine,38 16,"

aa607dcac82cc6471e55efddef09b0cc3b504aee,Comprehensive evaluation of SNP identification with the Restriction Enzyme-based Reduced Representation Library (RRL) method,"BackgroundRestriction Enzyme-based Reduced Representation Library (RRL) method represents a relatively feasible and flexible strategy used for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) identification in different species. It has remarkable advantage of reducing the complexity of the genome by orders of magnitude. However, comprehensive evaluation for actual efficacy of SNP identification by this method is still unavailable.ResultsIn order to evaluate the efficacy of Restriction Enzyme-based RRL method, we selected Tsp 45I enzyme which covers 266 Mb flanking region of the enzyme recognition site according to in silico simulation on human reference genome, then we sequenced YH RRL after Tsp 45I treatment and obtained reads of which 80.8% were mapped to target region with an 20-fold average coverage, about 96.8% of target region was covered by at least one read and 257 K SNPs were identified in the region using SOAPsnp software.Compared with whole genome resequencing data, we observed false discovery rate (FDR) of 13.95% and false negative rate (FNR) of 25.90%. The concordance rate of homozygote loci was over 99.8%, but that of heterozygote were only 92.56%. Repeat sequences and bases quality were proved to have a great effect on the accuracy of SNP calling, SNPs in recognition sites contributed evidently to the high FNR and the low concordance rate of heterozygote. Our results indicated that repeat masking and high stringent filter criteria could significantly decrease both FDR and FNR.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that Restriction Enzyme-based RRL method was effective for SNP identification. The results highlight the important role of bias and the method-derived defects represented in this method and emphasize the special attentions noteworthy.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ye Du"", ids = ""49963546""); list(name = ""Hui Jiang"", ids = ""144031089""); list(name = ""Ying Chen"", ids = ""1685493""); list(name = ""Cong Li"", ids = ""49673351""); list(name = ""Meiru Zhao"", ids = ""47374947""); list(name = ""Jinghua Wu"", ids = ""47876384""); list(name = ""Yong Qiu"", ids = ""144205671""); list(name = ""Q Li"", ids = ""1750743""); list(name = ""Xiuqing Zhang"", ids = ""2319264"")",bbe0bc095e8ac5e4554d47fc45757b753d762824; d0271c92716fabd8ecf24a72d340943b1a8857f4; 0e90e042b899c5aac13b93216e77dd6cbb3109ac; d1ae19b17543d2c53dae7ae2698d275ee5ddf306; ece7238c82e7deb6e680ab7f01a398d05933b48d; aa607dcac82cc6471e55efddef09b0cc3b504aee,38eb73ec8ea218bf1e8dc0e0629339509251c08a; d6436c368b39edad3e18025326d61681f0ee7dc7; 55b9582d21df3023f921f8400fa3b9b41ac9ad85; 176048a963d4c7dbdd86c9ee6942c29342087533; c8988b78dafc8ed57fa3468a09ea208827019b85; b51290aa04f5eeb39bdfb95697fee931c9e48b4b; 546c72a564fd126c214ab99016fb3166d12a3814; 09dcf91bb2271e8d71661145d1a042e6699b95f4; f50aa6fd3219148e91a614c1033fd5e6ac33b225; 444f8e9f9f1a22f54bd9691536128deaa56e4b52; cac326d244d806a4562c27037bf26da14650dcb4; 1f47797e85aa2c463d376b0ce20d0ae3e622402c; aa607dcac82cc6471e55efddef09b0cc3b504aee; 665c4a8ad452af0c9ea146ca33aeced104b6763f; 6062c4966617720c008af843b854ad9f2fd1fb4a; a4e5cdf2d314fa87dbc45de692ffd7965c93a259; 19063661039a44af4f9763f09e662e5b2431b154; 821a172acf297d45dc7e1b305138fe158d4e4cf3; 11f647b95a7c9a94c346cd8dc53987105cb0f7c1; d72b95a4fbd38b76298fb926e0bec255bd173be9; e18b33f5428ff9a4dd7c26e4c569245c5acc1ee1; 6328473f2237a157e904cbfb5bad8bc9a15f6b10,BMC Genomics,13,77 - 77

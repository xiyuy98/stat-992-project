As clinical parameters are insufficient for identifying these two groups of patients, we investigated whether gene expression profiling would add further information.MethodsWe performed gene expression analysis (oligonucleotide arrays, 26,824 reporters) on 143 patients with lymph node-negative disease and tumor-free margins. A support vector machine was employed to build classifiers using leave-one-out cross-validation.ResultsWithin the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subgroup, the gene expression profile clearly distinguished patients with local recurrence after radiotherapy (n = 20) from those without local recurrence (n = 80 with or without radiotherapy). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area was 0.91, and 5,237 of 26,824 reporters had a P value of less than 0.001 (false discovery rate = 0.005). This gene expression profile provides substantially added value to conventional clinical markers (for example, age, histological grade, and tumor size) in predicting local recurrence despite radiotherapy. Within the ER- subgroup, a weaker, but still significant, signal was found (ROC area = 0.74). The ROC area for distinguishing patients who develop local recurrence from those who remain local recurrence-free in the absence of radiotherapy was 0.66 (combined ER+/ER-).ConclusionA highly distinct gene expression profile for patients developing local recurrence after breast-conservation surgery despite radiotherapy has been identified. If verified in further studies, this profile might be a most important tool in the decision making for surgery and adjuvant therapy.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Emma NimÃ©us-MalmstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""1402514145""); list(name = ""Morten Krogh"", ids = ""3153983""); list(name = ""Per MalmstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""12361601""); list(name = ""Carina Strand"", ids = ""145111117""); list(name = ""Irma Fredriksson"", ids = ""35027603""); list(name = ""Per Karlsson"", ids = ""103659138""); list(name = ""Bo NordenskjÃ¶ld"", ids = ""4139328""); list(name = ""Olle StÃ¥l"", ids = ""1717181""); list(name = ""GÃ¶rel Ã–stberg"", ids = ""1816369""); list(name = ""Carsten Peterson"", ids = ""145171199""); list(name = ""MÃ¥rten FernÃ¶"", ids = ""2365005"")",363d0f3949e069298bf1cd1a80226a60d9326c43; 50432d465fda4d0b2307680b529129b7242018ef; d40f6d16bc229fec3053c5dd80a502988090383f; f5e3f254b3164c53972db9269192d47b89a9d801; 4e324da41464455cacb17400fc7cd47920c06163; 2c9cf5253e6b2c93c9e5b4772e2a0143405f40db; 1eff61aff01276cc652aeb88be05d590d4bbeaee; ba9e57c1a005475812fa7e10b4c2651c5a2b4b73; ea62c23726e1862c894ce3464008ee94cd1ddc4b; 3c24fa4040a430629aac81f1475bbc0d84b04e62; a6313f854f57692167bf36bd844f784156e3ba29; 0c40951ff9ab0e28d839c03c20150f723f6e0659; 45f0840f8b3b96f2ad5cef637d86aedded79d019; be192b35dbdd2f87e895502b210cb0aa2d0b572e; 44ae145b4c14d5f360be62bb77abb23fb67ab391; a5eb3394090165a25efde539061eb7b7b65c2b2e; 4038a14dc12b7e14bf0122b70297f9152815de9c; 5e449d824b7ffb78f5e0a42b825585d52908d00a; d44a249b7ae6806b9ca0f7171d39b3eaf0fbd55d; b9aa20b5d5e9c6c743cab0a71f29382d9a677fb0; cfe07b628f2eac65c0092dec5a90cb7c12c013a1; 824cfa2171174f687938d8e393a921cfe7d81b77; 23584bdc202b786737afa48089c017aa43e48cd6; a660df8354974548521fb4714191f58692be0abc; 2480f484a879746ae010a74d04446d897d945db7; 43e0e58d58f352fe60c83bf353a14caeb9e1f8cd; 4cb8a61256e595095c49296815ada214b9763f3c; a49f4faeb4802748198a32e253768343daed617b; 933bd9ae4abe8e755018333c9847f2c14da70629; 92c6514def127eddcc78749e514a485ab08c84de,1762b17ed2939d5fc0f559e439413f4b2cb3f0d9; fe2262e0c984ef8f5e22716dd140e2a5701fdb6b; 598eb4aa99f6176e0aa64a6f7e04ca5f9e008981; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222; 04104a9e607ffa615dc5163af2a52ed925c0bf9f; 3c917db744a25ef7392eefd4e8d86853a2901f0b; 4baac9512e789b12fb9ae1e2b44148b7c31f52f0; 82ffd8fd9a799064fdaefe9e6983b50d5279592d; c8ab2dddf63bea242ddf0c441812eaf76297fff4; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; d0a47c8c9c4213edd24a120a6912ebc08e348a19; 83e4c8bf00da0e573a1d7b8966692a61722f73c9; bca13cacf656fee8d6e84da45dfc661dd6df7baa; a0edf5dd293c3d3535b3b3121d2706e2c9f37b1b; 774c1c8fc2196eb04c9a2effbdc5a6a40872b0f8; 10e48b72510bf3a870947a1ae4b998556751ced3; 79ed939ea1f4b25e519a6c423e35b785ff596e48; 3d3fddab1757a49dfd4d4e948fc5d0bc31ef1a3a; abdf15d0094f90f4fb1379d918ef00d8101b1953; 7a6630615fbb0abdf545436fe536141520546ed8; 7025713a444b72542a989ec7b1bd16206a59878b; bfcc31a08514ac9779dbcef680454db56bc9a44a; 6e436b11eab90258229643cd47861f430f00080c; 35d12770a704178c15468cf3695f81703a3a2a6e; beebb981b045d9f23700b3334ca4405fed6136b1; 58d9e780b459f0336f15ac28a8c6c68ec158b349; cd356ac214ca6ccdc22379903f37e30d827a0f9b; 5d3c3c6d84980ac97932062ee59efc76998b7dde; 35dad47f88ec57d2a1a638983ddfd235582dc042; 22b4fc0bd039037cc903eb1c41fe851066289e0a; f1f5d009f8b535b1e294ff7869831520c1506060; 2fceeeeb40611a21d627e6e13951d42142bb8b81; c27b930e2e237c2582ddcb751a375e309c50cd51; 64c09e8d8c3f023cfe95a95ff504c513cc5c55b0; 1c8796ac755bde0162d4ba2f65ada88a13a0b7ee; c979fc18ccb8d9cc9ee87833d8fcbb68076b1884; 4294f9ed8d560b0643a3b228e66d0fd5e2028c6c; 3923879f4a11c76e9284352e23d723354c3e7075; e55d10d190391426bae0609b0b7dfc824e12c7b7; 2a0bf30dc789b2f9aa9f1078cff496afe54134e2,Breast Cancer Research : BCR,10,R34 - R34
1255b8dd3d30207bd52205c62135d4dd61497b55,ET-Lasso: A New Efficient Tuning of Lasso-type Regularization for High-Dimensional Data,"The $L_1 $ regularization (Lasso) has proven to be a versatile tool to select relevant features and estimate the model coefficients simultaneously and has been widely used in many research areas such as genomes studies, finance, and biomedical imaging. Despite its popularity, it is very challenging to guarantee the feature selection consistency of Lasso especially when the dimension of the data is huge. One way to improve the feature selection consistency is to select an ideal tuning parameter. Traditional tuning criteria mainly focus on minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model probability, such as cross-validation and BIC, which may either be time-consuming or fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when the number of features is extremely large. The other way is to introduce pseudo-features to learn the importance of the original ones. Recently, the Knockoff filter is proposed to control the FDR when performing feature selection. However, its performance is sensitive to the choice of the expected FDR threshold. Motivated by these ideas, we propose a new method using pseudo-features to obtain an ideal tuning parameter. In particular, we present the E fficient T uning of Lasso (ET-Lasso ) to separate active and inactive features by adding permuted features as pseudo-features in linear models. The pseudo-features are constructed to be inactive by nature, which can be used to obtain a cutoff to select the tuning parameter that separates active and inactive features. Experimental studies on both simulations and real-world data applications are provided to show that ET-Lasso can effectively and efficiently select active features under a wide range of scenarios.",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Songshan Yang"", ids = ""7388953""); list(name = ""Jiawei Wen"", ids = ""3037841""); list(name = ""Xiang Zhan"", ids = ""48550761""); list(name = ""Daniel Kifer"", ids = ""1852261"")",,d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; 8bb843b4f274d77c60944e5ac7365a2f36d76c7d; 90bf6b37ab7305d1a0040155bbef95064edbf682; 5a607f6990bdf37fa2623be43ede7fd55b5bed79; 63c68278418b69f60b4814fae8dd15b1b1854295; a35d565e8f70cb6ddc09a65904a72622e16b9485; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 229f46e78c8ba96da2febc39a07e1c8e4daf4b7a; f3196cb46d1f26986c9a2c3cde99eb9e2b1d205c; fc073321996d337e843173567f291d5dd557baa7; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; a6f5c8d82f27bd68eb4cc40bc3d0b00fccc5d469; ecc2ca3150dc4d4d8dceedab244114f191e05742; d90199f223e270a23b76e838bd28c04cbe6e081b; 7335660e55f5537dcb09ca29e689211dacffe40e; 2942c20f111d6fd38ef6dd53bb6eeb3b880e3d5f; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 0e1218212f7072826d2ef690b51bce9d5323e22d; 7ed849c45ee0d5e45423226e967bfaab4af35e72; 4045277aa61dc86ece50bbd00a4b90da8ed076a4; 6ca19a7ba29e421ffb130ecf3d66230fff570ee5; ec26b01efa0639be672d07651d32a06bae4c8c63; c59c6afcfd5d03eb2c8fb5d1665afacc077771b9; 4ca5a833b8464a1e7ab46d04db6aeb2794eca848; bb1a5a581e42f98ef0c56a1b8ce8773fbffb326b; 0113548122c1c6869eeafe6c2d21ee8a825c34c2; 58cf3959f979746225fa7a3a334a3a4eb9552edb; 50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106; 74e809b24c29e40e3e48e326edfa41893e31b980; 66fa6d8f057a2fac0cc80112364bec7ad9088101; d28633983821aa3d886fd6379c52ea78dca51f28; c74cb2dc88baec89af714577ddafa454ab785135,Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining,,
96b29946eb562c02c0d906aa215e70e2f08bf704,Novel association of polymorphic genetic variants with predictors of outcome of catheter ablation in atrial fibrillation: new directions from a prospective study (DECAF),"PurposeNon-pulmonary vein (non-PV) triggers and left atrial (LA) scars perpetuate atrial fibrillation (AF) and limit the success rate of catheter ablation. In order to understand the genetic basis of these risk factors, we examined the association of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with scar and non-PV triggers.MethodsFour hundred AF patients (67Â % male, 62â€‰Â±â€‰12Â years, LA size 45.3â€‰Â±â€‰7Â mm, 64Â % non-paroxysmal) undergoing catheter ablation were prospectively enrolled. DNA extractions for 16 AF-related SNPS from blood samples were performed of which 371 DNA samples were available for genotyping. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for assessing predictive role of individual SNP, and logistic kernel-machine approach was applied to test the cumulative effect of multiple SNPs as a group with non-PV triggers and LA scar. False discovery rate (FDR) was computed for all candidate SNPs to address multiple testing.ResultsSNPs rs6599230 and rs6843082 were inversely associated (OR 0.68, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04, and 0.62, pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, respectively) whereas rs1448817 (OR 1.74, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04) and rs7193343 (OR 1.66, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) predicted higher risk of non-PV triggers. Genotypes for rs6599230 and rs6843082 conferred 51Â % reduction in the odds for non-PV triggers (combined OR 0.49, pâ€‰=â€‰0.019), while rs1448817 and rs7193343 demonstrated a combined OR of 1.93, pâ€‰=â€‰0.025. FDR was controlled at 16Â % to adjust for multiple testing. For LA scar, inverse association was observed with rs1448817 (OR 0.29, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), rs17042171 (OR 0.27, pâ€‰=â€‰0.032), rs3807989 (OR 0.54, pâ€‰=â€‰0.017), and rs6843082 (OR 0.56, pâ€‰=â€‰0.009). Two SNPs were associated with increased scar risk: rs17375901 (OR 3.68, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and rs7193343 (OR 1.74, pâ€‰=â€‰0.037). For global association of SNPs with left atrial scar FDR was controlled at â‰¤10Â % to adjust for multiple testing.ConclusionsThis study has a strong clinical significance as it provides important insights into the molecular basis of pertinent therapeutic targets. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of certain genetic polymorphisms increases the risk of scar and non-PV triggers in AF patients. Therefore, PVAI alone will not be enough to eliminate the arrhythmia and the operators may need to identify and isolate the non-PV foci to maximize procedural success in patients carrying these risk variants.Clinical trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov (NCT01751607)",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sanghamitra Mohanty"", ids = ""51469580""); list(name = ""Amelia Weber Hall"", ids = ""5053958""); list(name = ""Prasant Mohanty"", ids = ""2082015""); list(name = ""Sameer Prakash"", ids = ""37600760""); list(name = ""Chintan Trivedi"", ids = ""88465638""); list(name = ""Luigi Di Biase"", ids = ""4906218""); list(name = ""Pasquale Santangeli"", ids = ""144834118""); list(name = ""Rong Bai"", ids = ""152318407""); list(name = ""John Burkhardt"", ids = ""114417671""); list(name = ""G.

f82ee802efcc450f77bb51c4a3c103b3243885f1,A Bovine PeptideAtlas of milk and mammary gland proteomes.,"Proteome information resources of farm animals are lagging behind those of the classical model organisms despite their important biological and economic relevance. Here, we present a Bovine PeptideAtlas, representing a first collection of Bos taurus proteome data sets within the PeptideAtlas framework. This database was built primarily as a source of information for designing selected reaction monitoring assays for studying milk production and mammary gland health, but it has an intrinsic general value for the farm animal research community. The Bovine PeptideAtlas comprises 1921 proteins at 1.2% false discovery rate (FDR) and 8559 distinct peptides at 0.29% FDR identified in 107 samples from six tissues. The PeptideAtlas web interface has a rich set of visualization and data exploration tools, enabling users to interactively mine information about individual proteins and peptides, their prototypic features, genome mappings, and supporting spectral evidence.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Stine L.

False discovery rate (FDR) has been considered a proper type I error rate to control for discovery-based high-throughput data analysis. Various multiple testing procedures have been proposed to control the FDR. The power and stability properties of some commonly used multiple testing procedures have not been extensively investigated yet, however. Simulation studies were conducted to compare power and stability properties of five widely used multiple testing procedures at different proportions of true discoveries for various sample sizes for both independent and dependent test statistics. Storey's two linear step-up procedures showed the best performance among all tested procedures considering FDR control, power, and variance of true discoveries.

f28a484b9af1dfca4b98218000b405145658c76d,A new probabilistic database search algorithm for ETD spectra.,"Peptide characterization using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) is an important analytical tool for protein identification. The fragmentation observed in ETD spectra is complementary to that seen when using the traditional dissociation method, collision activated dissociation (CAD). Applications of ETD enhance the scope and complexity of the peptides that can be studied by mass spectrometry-based methods. For example, ETD is shown to be particularly useful for the study of post-translationally modified peptides. To take advantage of the power provided by ETD, it is important to have an ETD-specific database search engine, an integral tool of mass spectrometry-based analytical proteomics. In this paper, we report on our development of a database search engine using ETD spectra and protein sequence databases to identify peptides. The search engine is based on the probabilistic modeling of shared peaks count and shared peaks intensity between the spectra and the peptide sequences. The shared peaks count accounts for the cumulative variations from amino acid sequences, while shared peaks intensity models the variations between the candidate sequence and product ion intensities. To demonstrate the utility of this algorithm for searching real-world data, we present the results of applications of this model to two high-throughput data sets. Both data sets were obtained from yeast whole cell lysates. The first data set was obtained from a sample digested by Lys-C, and the second data set was obtained by a digestion using trypsin. We searched the data sets against a combined forward and reversed yeast protein database to estimate false discovery rates. We compare the search results from the new methods with the results from a search engine often employed for ETD spectra, OMSSA. Our findings show that overall the new model performs comparably to OMSSA for low false discovery rates. At the same time, we demonstrate that there are substantial differences with OMSSA for results on subsets of data. Therefore, we conclude the new model can be considered as being complementary to previously developed models.",2009,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rovshan G.

09601d579a96fc9d33343fa9a2a463ab4f081cfe,Extracting Latent Economic Signal from Online Activity Streams,"Online activity generates a myriad of weak economically relevant signals, ranging from content-rich interactions such as blog posts, venue reviews and status updates, to more transient or even autonomic signal such as search queries, purchases or realtime ad auctions. In this work we develop an approach to distilling latent economic indicators from large collections of realtime activity streams. In particular we investigate the relative contribution of several online activity streams on forecasting a large cross-section of economic indicators. In order to effectively overcome noise inherent in the extracted weak signals and prevent overfitting, we develop a low-rank vector autoregression (VAR) formulation based on sparse matrix factorization. Large-scale mining of online activity data can potentially augment traditional economic analyses in several ways: (1) improving forecasting: E.g., we find social network factors are more predictive of unemployment and consumer discretionary spending than a basket of econometric factors, (2) capturing network effects via cross-domain social transfer: E.g., increases in unemployment indicators lead to technology and computing-related searches; wedding planning on Yelp is a leading indicator of positive sentiment on Facebook, and (3) the development of macroeconomic and sentiment indicators with significantly lower latency than is traditionally available. 1 Background Over the last decade, the Web has emerged as the primary medium for a large number of economic transactions, expression of consumer, producer and political sentiment, and the development novel trends [cf. 15]. Goel et al. summarize this observation succinctly, regarding online activity as â€œa snapshot of the collective consciousness, reflecting the instantaneous interests, concerns, and intentions of the global populationâ€ [14]. In this work, we will use the term online activity to refer to the broad spectrum of events resulting from users interacting with the Web. Such events range from the content-rich, e.g. posting news articles, blog entries, product and venue reviews, and status messages on social media sites, to the more transient, e.g. Web searches, location-based venue checkins, page views and ad impressions. As proxies for consumer behavior, online activity streams have been posited to predict a wealth of economic, social and political indicators. For example, Gruhl et al. use blog â€œchatterâ€ to predict the sales rank of items on Amazon [15]; Oâ€™Connor et al. use Twitter sentiment to predict public opinion around elections [23]; several studies use Twitter to predict the box-office success of movies, e.g. via sentiment clues [20] or simply tweet volume [2]; and Google uses flu-related search queries to predict outbreaks, often faster than the CDC [12]. Online sentiment has also been shown to be informative for econometric problems. For example, Tetlock finds that negative media sentiment can forecast short term movements in stock price [25]. Gilbert and Karahalios find that collective mood is potentially predictive of financial decisions [11]. 1 Google maintains a domestic trends index [1] tracking economically relevant aggregate search traffic across a diverse set of sectors, ranging from auto and home sales to US unemployment claims [6]. Finally the Billion Prices Project seeks to define a bottom-up measure of CPI based on extracting and classifying prices from online retailers [5]. We contribute to this notion of â€œWeb as Economic signalâ€ in two ways: (1) extracting indicators of online activity from a large variety of sources, and (2) developing a robust modeling approach based on vector autoregression (VAR), bridging the gap between large-scale Web extraction and traditional econometric analysis. VAR models are used to capture symmetric linear interdependencies between multiple time series without imposing significant model constraints. In order to address overfitting and spurious correlations due to high dimensional data, we extend VAR by assuming a a low-rank `1-sparse autoregressive factor structure. This sparse pooling VAR (spVAR) model can be implemented efficiently using Forward Backward splitting [7], allowing it to robustly scale to upwards of 10k base time-series. spVAR is similar to dynamic factor models for large cross-sectional VARs [cf. 9, 24], where it is assumed that dynamic interrelations between variables can be explained by a few common factors. However, in this work we assume factor stationarity since our online activity sample consists of only a single year. We apply spVAR to a comprehensive set of indicators derived from both econometric data and online activity including search queries, venue reviews, microblogs, status updates and realtime ad prices. A total of 133 separate signals (116 based on Web activity and 17 econometric) are included in this study. Due to the large number of hypotheses tested, in order to control for inflated false positive rate due to multiplicity, we adjust p-values using false discovery rate [8]. We find that social network factors are more predictive of unemployment and consumer discretionary spending than a basket of econometric factors. Furthermore this effect is robust across disparate data sources, e.g. holding true for both Yelp reviews and Twitter posts, lending evidence for the existence of a low-rank set of social factors influencing economic variables. Hence, incorporating measures of online activity can potentially augment traditional economic analysis. 2 Data Sources We collect 12 months of daily Web activity data (2010-10-18 to 2011-10-18) from six highdimensional, low-latency sources: â€¢ Twitter â€“ A popular microblogging service containing news content and public mood. â€¢ Yelp Reviews â€“ Review data from the crowd-sourced local business site Yelp. â€¢ Crowdsourced News â€“ Article headlines from the top stories posted to the tech blog Hacker News. â€¢ Facebook Gross National Happiness â€“ Aggregate sentiment indices derived from Facebook status message updates [fb gnh; 21]. â€¢ Ad Exchanges â€“ Supply-side display ad pricing data for 11k publishers (10B impressions) on three large ad exchanges ad ex. â€¢ Google Domestic Trends â€“ Daily relative search term frequency across a wide range of economic and topical sectors (e.g. Advertising, Construction, Durable goods, Mortgage, and Unemployment) [gdi us; 6]. Raw data from Twitter, Yelp and Hacker News are converted into low-dimensional time series by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [4] with Kâ€œ100. In order to place the online activity stream data in a broader context, we compare it with a set of macroeconomic time series from the Federal Reserve Data research archive (collectively, the econometric set)12 and a set of financial time series collected from Yahoo finance3 research.stlouisfed.org (Data Granularity) We focus on high-granularity series with either daily or weekly availability as several of our online activity series are only available back for a single year. This precludes richer economic data such as CPI, GDP, consumer sentiment and housing starts which are available monthly or even quarterly. finance.yahoo.com 2 The primary macroeconomic indicators we collect are M2 Money Supply and Weekly Initial Jobless Claims. The M2 money supply measure (fred m2) is commonly used in macroeconomic models to forecast inflation [16]. Jobless claims tracks â€œemergent unemploymentâ€ via the number of people filing for unemployment insurance each week. In particular we are interested in whether changes in money supply or unemployment result in shifts in online behavior (or vice-versa). We also collect data on, e.g., large cap stocks (fred sp500), near term volatility or â€œfearâ€ (fred vixcls) and corporate bond yields (fred dbaa). From Yahoo, we include market sectoral indicator proxies available as publicly traded ETFs: Energy (XLE), Financials (XLF), Industrial (XLI), Technology (XLK), Utilities (XLU), Consumer Discretionary (XLY). 3 Sparse Pooling Vector Autoregression We propose an approach to structural modeling and forecasting based on the vector autoregressive (VAR) process [17] that is capable of scaling to a large number of noisy time-series. In particular we impose restrictions on the covariance structure so that it is low-rank and sparse, limiting the number of parameters to estimate [cf. 13]. Such sparsity is desirable because it potentially conveys information about the structure of the VAR [24]. A vector autoregression model (VAR) consists of a set of K endogenous variables: yt â€œ py1t, . . . , ykt, . . . , yKtq, k P r1,Ks. An spVARpqq process is defined as yt â€œ A1yt Ì1 ` . . .`Aqyt Ìq ` ut where Ap is a K Ë† K coefficient matrix, and ut is a K-dimensional zero-mean, covariancestationary innovation process, i.e. Eruts â€œ 0 and Eruyut s â€œ Î£u. The sparse pooling VAR model (spVAR) further imposes that constraint that the matrices Ap are low-rank, rankpApq Ä r and `1 sparse [26, 3, 13]. spVAR assumes temporal covariance stationarity; i.e. tAutPp1...T q is constant across the entire history. In practice however, time-series dynamics tend to switch between multiple stationary regimes.4 To efficiently estimate spVAR in high dimension we use a variant of Forward-Backward Splitting with forward-looking subgradients [FOBOS; 7]. FOBOS alternates between two steps: (1) an unconstrained gradient descent step, and (2) minimization of the regularization term keeping the solution close to the result of step 1. 4 VAR Forecasting Performance For VAR forecasting, we are interested in the combinations of data sources that are most predictive of others, focusing in particular on what series can potentially forecast established economic indicators (i.e. the econometric data set). Figure 1 shows individual RMSEs for each response variable broken down by training source, relative to training using econometric. We find that: 1.

b94c18ad998e70b3d94181cd7615f9b6fef10b92,"Early-onset preeclampsia, plasma microRNAs and endothelial cell function.","BACKGROUND
Preeclampsia is a hypertensive pregnancy disorder, in which generalized systemic inflammation and maternal endothelial dysfunction are involved in the pathophysiology. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and involved in many physiological processes. They mainly downregulate translation of their target genes.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to compare the plasma miRNA concentrations in preeclampsia, healthy pregnancy and non-pregnant women. Furthermore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of three highly increased plasma miRNAs in preeclampsia on endothelial cell function in vitro.


STUDY DESIGN
We compared 3,391 (precursor) miRNA concentrations in plasma samples from early-onset preeclamptic women, gestational age matched healthy pregnant women and non-pregnant women using miRNA 3.1. arrays (Affymetrix) and validated our findings by real-time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR). Subsequently, endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) were transfected with microRNA mimics (we choose the three miRNAs with the highest fold change and lowest false discovery rate in preeclampsia vs. healthy pregnancy). After transfection, functional assays were performed to evaluate if overexpression of the microRNAs in endothelial cells affected endothelial cell function in vitro. Functional assays were the wound healing assay (which measures cell migration and proliferation), the proliferation assay and the tube formation assay (which assesses formation of endothelial cell tubes during the angiogenic process). To determine if the miRNAs are able to decrease gene expression of certain genes, RNA was isolated from transfected endothelial cells and gene expression (by measuring RNA expression) was evaluated by gene expression microarray (Genechip Human Gene 2.1 ST arrays [Life Technologies]). For the microarray we used pooled samples, but the differently expressed genes in the microarray were validated by RT qPCR in individual samples.


RESULTS
No significant differences (fold change < -1.2 or > 1.2 with a false discovery rate < 0.05) were found in miRNA plasma concentrations between healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women. The plasma concentrations of 26 (precursor) miRNAs were different between preeclampsia and healthy pregnancy. The 3 miRNAs which were increased with the highest fold change and lowest false discovery rate in preeclampsia vs. healthy pregnancy were miR-574-5p, miR-1972, and miR-4793-3p. Transfection of endothelial cells with these miRNAs in showed that miR-574-5p decreased (p<0.05) the wound healing capacity (i.e. decreased endothelial cell migration and/or proliferation) and tended (p<0.1) to decrease proliferation, miR-1972 decreased tube formation (p<0.05) and also tended (p<0.1) to decrease proliferation and miR-4793-3p tended (p<0.1) to decrease both the wound healing capacity and tube formation in vitro. Gene expression analysis of transfected endothelial cells revealed that miR-574-5p tended (p<0.1) to decrease the expression of the proliferation marker MKI67.


CONCLUSION
We conclude that in the early-onset preeclampsia group in our study different concentrations of plasma miRNAs are present as compared with healthy pregnancy. Our results suggest that miR-574-5p and miR-1972 decrease the proliferation (probably via decreasing MKI67) and/or migration as well as the tube formation capacity of endothelial cells. Therefore, these miRNAs may be anti-angiogenic factors affecting endothelial cells in preeclampsia.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simone V Lip"", ids = ""27739802""); list(name = ""Mark Boekschoten"", ids = ""6505707""); list(name = ""Guido J Hooiveld"", ids = ""143804111""); list(name = ""MariÃ«lle G. van Pampus"", ids = ""145958353""); list(name = ""Sicco Scherjon"", ids = ""2532922""); list(name = ""Torsten PlÃ¶sch"", ids = ""8520068""); list(name = ""Marijke M.

We compared the SPM results on FDG PET imaging of early AD using uncorrected p-value, random-field based corrected p-value and false discovery rate (FDR) control. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight patients ( years old) with early AD and 18 age-matched normal controls ( years old) underwent FDG brain PET. To identify brain regions with hypo-metabolism in group or individual patient compared to normal controls, group images or each patient's image was compared with normal controls usingthe same fixed p-value of 0.001 on uncorrected thresholding, random-field based corrected thresholding and FDR control. Results: The number of hypo-metabolic voxels was smallest in corrected p-value method, largest in uncorrected p-value method and intermediate in FDG thresholding in group analysis. Three types of result pattern were found. The first was that corrected p-value did not yield any voxel positive but FDR gave a few significantly hypometabolic voxels (8/28, 29%). The second was that both corrected p-value and FDR did not yield any positive region but numerous positive voxels were found with the threshold of uncorrected p-values (6/28, 21%). The last was that FDR was detected as many positive voxels as uncorrected p-value method (14/28, 50%). Conclusions FDR control could identify hypo-metaboiic areas in group or individual patients with early AD. We recommend FDR control instead of uncorrected or random-field corrected thresholding method to find the areas showing hypometabolism especially in small group or individual analysis of FDG PET.",2003,Psychology,"list(name = ""Dong Soo Lee"", ids = ""122808612""); list(name = ""Hyejin Kang"", ids = ""34690610""); list(name = ""Myung-Jin Jang"", ids = ""70234652""); list(name = ""Sang-soo Cho"", ids = ""6270536""); list(name = ""Won Jun Kang"", ids = ""2227440""); list(name = ""Jae Sung Lee"", ids = ""145712471""); list(name = ""Eunjoo Kang"", ids = ""34594181""); list(name = ""Kanguk Lee"", ids = ""14934789""); list(name = ""J Woo"", ids = ""144195176""); list(name = ""Myung-Chul Lee"", ids = ""91038455"")",06871ab21bd4ec2c36be0962873e15b3298fa86f,25f017fc8d5073dafcff32641f8408e129806449; e4e4d3fb2bdc62e3a09060253d37f8bcbf346689; b39625ef78187ea356a41afe2eab15d4685a8ae6; 07ea5116c8a00f2f016876a38562da2a18cc943d; 599703a0cc3dfd432d6bdef5bf01dccb861b46b6; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b,,37,374-381

However, recent quantitative MRI studies have shown structural abnormalities in cortical and thalamic grey matter (GM) in JME. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a fully automated, unbiased, operator-independent MRI analysis technique that detects regionally specific differences in brain tissue composition on a voxel-wise comparison between groups of subjects. Using VBM, we examined structural differences in cortical and subcortical GM volume (GMV) between 25 JME patients (15 women, mean age=22.7+/-5.1 years) and age- and sex-matched 44 control subjects (27 women, mean age=23.1+/-4.3 years). We also performed a correlation analysis to delineate a possible relationship between the GMV increases or reductions and the increasing duration of epilepsy. Group comparison showed GMV increases in the superior mesiofrontal region bilaterally and GMV reductions in the thalamus bilaterally in JME patients (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate). Correlation analysis revealed that bilateral thalamic GMV had negative correlations with the duration of epilepsy (P<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons after small volume corrections; P<0.05, Pearson correlation test). Our findings of GMV increases in the superior mesiofrontal regions and progressive thalamic atrophy could further support the pathophysiological concept of the functional abnormalities in thalamocortical circuit in JME.",2007,Psychology;

Socioeconomic experiences are recognized determinants of health, and recent work has shown that social disadvantages in early life may induce sustained biological changes at molecular level that are detectable later in life. However, the dynamics and persistence of biological embedding of socioeconomic position (SEP) remains vastly unexplored.


METHODS
Using the data from the ALSPAC birth cohort, we performed epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation changes at three life stages (birth, nâ€‰=â€‰914; childhood at mean age 7.5 years, nâ€‰=â€‰973; and adolescence at mean age 15.5 years, nâ€‰=â€‰974), measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip, in relation to pregnancy SEP indicators (maternal and paternal education and occupation).


RESULTS
Across the four early life SEP metrics investigated, only maternal education was associated with methylation levels at birth, and four CpGs mapped to SULF1, GLB1L2 and RPUSD1 genes were identified [false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P-valueâ€‰<0.05]. No epigenetic signature was found associated with maternal education in child samples, but methylation levels at 20 CpG loci were found significantly associated with maternal education in adolescence. Although no overlap was found between the differentially methylated CpG sites at different ages, we identified two CpG sites at birth and during adolescence which are 219â€‰bp apart in the SULF1 gene that encodes an heparan sulphatase involved in modulation of signalling pathways. Using data from an independent birth cohort, the ENVIRONAGE cohort, we were not able to replicate these findings.


CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, our results suggest that parental SEP, and particularly maternal education, may influence the offspring's methylome at birth and adolescence.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rossella Alfano"", ids = ""50134797""); list(name = ""Florence Guida"", ids = ""50642876""); list(name = ""Bruna Galobardes"", ids = ""48648484""); list(name = ""Marc Chadeau-Hyam"", ids = ""1380692828""); list(name = ""Cyrille Delpierre"", ids = ""3878869""); list(name = ""Akram Ghantous"", ids = ""4410542""); list(name = ""John Henderson"", ids = ""145633380""); list(name = ""Zdenko Herceg"", ids = ""3392405""); list(name = ""Pooja Jain"", ids = ""47452646""); list(name = ""Tim S.

5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2,Multiple Hypotheses Testing with Weights,"In this paper we offer a multiplicity of approaches and procedures for multiple testing problems with weights. Some rationale for incorporating weights in multiple hypotheses testing are discussed. Various type-I error-rates and different possible formulations are considered, for both the intersection hypothesis testing and the multiple hypotheses testing problems. An optimal per family weighted error-rate controlling procedure a la Spjotvoll (1972) is obtained. This model serves as a vehicle for demonstrating the different implications of the approaches to weighting. Alternative approach es to that of Holm (1979) for family-wise error-rate control with weights are discussed, one involving an alternative procedure for family-wise error-rate control, and the other involving the control of a weighted family-wise error-rate. Extensions and modifications of the procedures based on Simes (1986) are given. These include a test of the overall intersec tion hypothesis with general weights, and weighted sequentially rejective procedures for testing the individual hypotheses. The false discovery rate controlling approach and procedure of Benjamini & Hochberg (1995) are extended to allow for different weights.",1997,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yoav Benjamini"", ids = ""50679934"");

Expression levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs in three human SAVNFH samples and three human femoral head fracture samples (controls) were detected using third-generation lncRNA microarrays (KangChen Biotech, Shanghai, China). The fold change, false discovery rate, and P value were utilized to filter genes with significant differential expression in the SAVNFH samples compared with the control samples. In total, there were 1179 upregulated and 3214 downregulated lncRNAs (P2. zerofold, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Meanwhile, 1092 upregulated and 565 downregulated mRNAs were found in the SAVNFH samples compared with the control samples. Then, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the previous microarray results using 8 and 20 selected dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, and the results generally confirmed the microarray findings. Finally, we used Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis to investigate the functions of the altered mRNAs and their associated GO terms and biological pathways. The Immune system process term (GO:0002376) was the most significantly upregulated GO term, and the Regulation of blood coagulation term (GO:0030193) was the most significantly downregulated GO term in the biological process category for the SAVNFH samples. ""Hematopoietic cell lineage - Homo sapiens (human) (Pathway ID: hsa04640)"" and ""Complement and coagulation cascades - Homo sapiens (human) (Pathway ID: hsa04610)"" were the most significantly up- and downregulated pathways in the SAVNFH samples compared with the controls. In conclusion, the differential expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs may be correlated with the pathogenesis of SAVNFH, and these significantly dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs may function through networks or participate in several specific biological processes. Further research is needed to understand their exact functions and mechanisms in SAVNFH.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hongbin Luo"", ids = ""93676351""); list(name = ""Weibin Lan"", ids = ""37527559""); list(name = ""Yongfeng Li"", ids = ""47002797""); list(name = ""Xiaolan Lian"", ids = ""144263616""); list(name = ""Nanwen Zhang"", ids = ""14763467""); list(name = ""Xinhua Lin"", ids = ""33145750""); list(name = ""Peng Chen"", ids = ""145983795"")",,,Journal of cellular biochemistry,,
9d171ffd9522602422e6eefd2ce96fdb7c004556,"Maternal Influences on the Transmission of Leukocyte Gene Expression Profiles in Population Samples from Brisbane, Australia","Two gene expression profiling studies designed to identify maternal influences on development of the neonate immune system and to address the population structure of the leukocyte transcriptome were carried out in Brisbane, Australia. In the first study, a comparison of 19 leukocyte samples obtained from mothers in the last three weeks of pregnancy with 37 umbilical cord blood samples documented differential expression of 7,382 probes at a false discovery rate of 1%, representing approximately half of the expressed transcriptome. An even larger component of the variation involving 8,432 probes, notably enriched for Vitamin E and methotrexate-responsive genes, distinguished two sets of individuals, with perfect transmission of the two profile types between each of 16 mother-child pairs in the study. A minor profile of variation was found to distinguish the gene expression profiles of obese mothers and children of gestational diabetic mothers from those of children born to obese mothers. The second study was of adult leukocyte profiles from a cross-section of Red Cross blood donors sampled throughout Brisbane. The first two axes in this study are related to the third and fourth axes of variation in the first study and also reflect variation in the abundance of CD4 and CD8 transcripts. One of the profiles associated with the third axis is largely excluded from samples from the central portion of the city. Despite enrichment of insulin signaling and aspects of central metabolism among the differentially expressed genes, there was little correlation between leukocyte expression profiles and body mass index overall. Our data is consistent with the notion that maternal health and cytokine milieu directly impact gene expression in fetal tissues, but that there is likely to be a complex interplay between cultural, genetic, and other environmental factors in the programming of gene expression in leukocytes of newborn children.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elizabeth J.

c5a6cdac4bbbe308d6be0a8519b3671153175329,"Functional, anatomical and diffusion tensor MRI study of radiology expertise.","BACKGROUND
Repeated practice to acquire expertise could result in the structural and functional changes in relevant brain circuits as a result of long-term potentiation, neurogenesis, glial genesis, and remodeling.


PURPOSE
The goal of this study is to use task fMRI to study the brain of expert radiologists performing a diagnosis task where a series of medical images were presented during fMRI acquisition for 12s and participants were asked to choose a diagnosis. Structural and diffusion-tensor MRI were also acquired.


METHODS
Radiologists (N = 12, 11M, 38.2Â±10.3 years old) and non-radiologists (N = 17, 15M, 30.6Â±5.5 years old) were recruited with informed consent. Medical images were presented for 12 s and three multiple choices were displayed and the participants were asked to choose a diagnosis. fMRI, structural and diffusion-tensor MRI were acquired. fMRI analysis used FSL to determine differences in fMRI responses between groups. Voxel-wise analysis was performed to determine if subcortical volume, cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy differed between groups. Correction for multiple comparisons used false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Radiologists showed overall lower task-related brain activation than non-radiologists. Radiologists showed significantly lower activation in the left lateral occipital cortex, left superior parietal lobule, occipital pole, right superior frontal and precentral gyri, lingual gyrus, and the left intraparietal sulcus (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between groups in cortical thickness, subcortical volume and fractional anisotropy (p>0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Radiologists and non-radiologists had no significant difference in structural metrics. However, in diagnosis tasks, radiologists showed markedly lower task-related brain activations overall as well as a number of high-order visual and non-visual brain regions than non-radiologists. Some brain circuits appear to be uniquely associated with differential-diagnosis paradigm expertise that are not involved in simpler object-recognition cases. Improved understanding of the brain circuitry involved in acquisition of expertise might be used to design optimal training paradigms.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""David J Ouellette"", ids = ""1661058245""); list(name = ""Eric K van Staalduinen"", ids = ""1557716912""); list(name = ""Syed H.

8f8596a77de10e74b1847abb4339c7d1e1024e0f,Parameter optimization of logistic regression classifiers,"Logistic regression (LR) classifiers have been used successfully in the single-trial analysis of EEG data, especially in tasks of perceptual decision-making [1,2], but heuristics govern the choices for classifier parameters, such as window size (Î´). Furthermore, no rigorous definition exists as to the number of epochs (N) of either class that would allow sufficient classifier training before testing using leave-one-out cross-validation. Here, we attempt to address these issues by exploring this discrete parameter space with the aid of a genetic algorithm. In doing so, we draw preliminary conclusions on both subject-specific and subject-general trends of these classifiers. To establish a baseline for comparison, we utilize EEG data from a previous study using LR to classify neural response to a two-choice forced-decision face vs. car visual task [1]. In this study, a window size (Î´) of 60 ms was used to segment epochs for classification. Other studies using this technique also employ a comparable window size [2,3], even though Î´ has the potential to drastically affect classifier training and performance. Similarly, the number of epochs used to train the classifier can greatly affect its performance, a number too low causing an insufficient number of points through which a dividing hyperplane can be found. Recognizing the dependence of classifier performance on these discrete parameters, we use a genetic algorithm to explore the Î´ vs. N design space. In doing so, we track an objective function whose value depends on maximizing an epoch windowâ€™s leave-one-out Az (area under receiveroperating characteristic) value while decreasing its variability (determined from bootstrapping), which increases with a low number of epochs. Once converging to subjectspecific values of Î´* and N*, we then test the classifier solution for statistical significance using the false discovery rate across all windows [4], as there are approximately E/ 2Î´* multiple comparisons for an E milliseconds epoch with 50% window overlap. First, minimizing our objective function with N held constant at its maximum, we find that Î´* can be tuned in a subject-specific way and we find on average a 3.7 Â± 1.1% improvement in maximum Az from that of the earlier study. Second, we vary Î´ (Î´ I [5, 6, ..., 149, 150]ms) and N (N I [10, 11, ..., Nmax-1, Nmax] ) simultaneously and converge using a genetic algorithm (6-bit resolution, 36-member population, 0.7 crossover probability, 0.7/ (population size) mutation probability, [5]) to a subjectspecific Î´* and N*. In each subject but one we find that N* < Nmax and that Î´* is a subject-specific parameter that differs from the heuristics offered by previous work. Finally, on a group level, we find that the components of our objective function exhibit distinct variation with respect to Î´ and N, with an epochâ€™s maximum Az optimizing for low N and low Î´, while its Az variability minimizes for high N and maximizes for low N, nearly irrespective of Î´.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Jason Sherwin"", ids = ""50113830""); list(name = ""Josh Chartier"", ids = ""49687865"")",8f8596a77de10e74b1847abb4339c7d1e1024e0f,c92a3cd42c3c45ef816ca8737153baa42db54bcf; a9df8b019ce713fe2340eef4daa650f34566870a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c2aecab4c859875e16f39f1c3f4365a774a5ba79; 6c3af41616c5293890e4e0092bbff9b64baa74dd; 8f8596a77de10e74b1847abb4339c7d1e1024e0f,BMC Neuroscience,14,P62 - P62

Previously, we tested the efficacy of Verteporfin (VP) in EMCA cells and observed cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects. In this study, we analyzed RNA sequencing data to investigate the comprehensive transcriptomic landscape of VP treated Type 1 EMCA cell lines, including HEC-1-A and HEC-1-B. There were 549 genes with differential expression of two-fold or greater and Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 after false discovery rate correction for the HEC-1-B cell line. Positive regulation of TGFÎ²1 production, regulation of lipoprotein metabolic process, cell adhesion, endodermal cell differentiation, formation and development, and integrin mediated signaling pathway were among the significantly associated terms. A functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes after VP treatment revealed extracellular matrix organization Gene Ontology as the most significant. CDC23 and BUB1B, two genes crucially involved in mitotic checkpoint progression, were found to be the pair with the best association from STRING among differentially expressed genes in VP treated HEC-1-B cells. Our in vivo results indicate that subcutaneous tumors in mice were regressed after VP treatment by inhibiting cell cycle pathway proteins.

35a8d3f928c8500a1b8039b196703b74d020f338,Sex and age differences in the expression of liver microRNAs during the life span of F344 rats,"BackgroundPhysiological factors such as age and sex have been shown to be risk factors for adverse effects in the liver, including liver diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Previously, we have reported age- and sex-related significant differences in hepatic basal gene expression in rats during the life span that may be related to susceptibility to such adverse effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of the gene expression changes were not fully understood. In recent years, increasing evidence for epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation has fueled interest in the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in toxicogenomics and biomarker discovery. We therefore proposed that significant age and sex differences exist in baseline liver miRNA expression, and that comprehensive profiling of miRNAs will provide insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in rat liver.MethodsTo address this, liver tissues from male and female F344 rats were examined at 2, 5, 6, 8, 15, 21, 52, 78, and 104Â weeks of age for the expression of 677 unique miRNAs. Following data processing, predictive pathway analysis was performed on selected miRNAs that exhibited prominent age and/or sex differences in expression.ResultsOf the 314 miRNAs found to be expressed, 214 were differentially expressed; 65 and 212 miRNAs showed significant (false discovery rate (FDR) <5% and â‰¥1.5-fold change) sex- and age-related differences in expression, respectively. Thirty-eight miRNAs showed 2-week-specific expression, of which 31 miRNAs were found to be encoded within the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster located on chromosome 6. This cluster has been associated with tissue proliferation and differentiation, and liver energy homeostasis in postnatal development. Predictive pathway analysis linked sex-biased miRNA expression with sexually dimorphic molecular functions and toxicological functions that may reflect sex differences in hepatic physiology and disease. The expression of miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-99a, and miR-203, miR-451) was also found to associate with specific sexually dimorphic hepatic histopathology. The expression of miRNAs involved in regulating cell death, cell proliferation, and cell cycle was found to change as the rats matured from adult to old age.ConclusionsOverall, significant age- and sex-related differences in liver miRNA expression were identified and linked to histopathological findings and predicted functional pathways that may underlie susceptibilities to liver toxicity and disease.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joshua C.

c79ec3ebc607ac74d866c5b00849a5e668a9b2d7,Breast Cancer Detection Using Ultra wideband Microwave,"Breast cancer is a second leading cause of cancer in women today after lung cancer and is the most common cancer among women according to WHO. At present Xray Mammography is approved technique for early breast cancer detection. But this technique have up to 20% false detection rate. There will be approximately 250,000 new cases of breast cancer in India by 2015. At present, India reports around 100,000 new incidence of breast cancer. We can eliminate this false detection using Microwave imaging. Microwave imaging is defined as \seeing"" the internal structure of an object by means of electromagnetic fields at microwave frequencies {300 MHz10 GHz}. Antenna is a key component in microwave imaging system. Micro strip antenna can become right candidate for Microwave imaging system. Because it is compact and planar but major drawback is its narrow bandwidth. But using deferent technique we can increase bandwidth up to 70% Microwave imaging has been suggested as a promising modality for early-stage breast cancer detection. In this paper, we propose a statistical microwave imaging technique wherein a set of generalized likelihood ratio tests (GLRT) is applied to microwave backscatter data to determine the presence and location of strong scatterers such as malignant tumors in the breast. The GLRT is formulated assuming that the backscatter data is Gaussian distributed with known covariance matrix. We describe the method for estimating this covariance matrix offline and formulating a GLRT for several heterogeneous two-dimensional (2-D) numerical breast phantoms, several three-dimensional (3D) experimental breast phantoms, and a 3-D numerical breast phantom with a realistic half-ellipsoid shape. Using the GLRT with the estimated covariance matrix and a threshold chosen to constrain the false discovery rate (FDR) of the image, we show the capability to detect and localize small (<0.6 cm) tumors in our numerical and experimental breast phantoms even when the dielectric contrast of the malignant-to-normal tissue is below 2:1.Single Layer Rectangular Micro strip Antennas with simple capacitive feed, offering an impedance bandwidth up to 50% is designed in IISc., Bangalore, India 2007 [1]. The proposed antenna is modification of above antenna. In this antenna, we replace rectangular patch with rectangular ring patch which increases impedance bandwidth more than 66.44% having resonance frequency 6.05 GHz.",2012,,"list(name = ""Nalini Tyagi"", ids = ""144488931""); list(name = ""Rahul Gupta"", ids = ""50517675""); list(name = ""Ruchi Singh"", ids = ""47609086"")",,feb5f6bf8e5582af1bcbc7536f1a5e692901f1a8; 72f8b7489011e79cc80c836ff7f599b77608dd4b; afdc1e25d38b8fbc35ad9f97e769f4f6dc7a84cc; cca03aaf3983b8158fa7ed11e29477a27aed3a8e,,,

SOAP3-dp, through leveraging the computational power of both CPU and GPU with optimized algorithms, delivers high speed and sensitivity simultaneously. Compared with widely adopted aligners including BWA, Bowtie2, SeqAlto, CUSHAW2, GEM and GPU-based aligners BarraCUDA and CUSHAW, SOAP3-dp was found to be two to tens of times faster, while maintaining the highest sensitivity and lowest false discovery rate (FDR) on Illumina reads with different lengths. Transcending its predecessor SOAP3, which does not allow gapped alignment, SOAP3-dp by default tolerates alignment similarity as low as 60%. Real data evaluation using human genome demonstrates SOAP3-dp's power to enable more authentic variants and longer Indels to be discovered. Fosmid sequencing shows a 9.1% FDR on newly discovered deletions.

8d5034ef663725ad42486c670cdec5b16b6fa8b5,Bayesian ensemble methods for survival prediction in gene expression data,"MOTIVATION
We propose a Bayesian ensemble method for survival prediction in high-dimensional gene expression data. We specify a fully Bayesian hierarchical approach based on an ensemble 'sum-of-trees' model and illustrate our method using three popular survival models. Our non-parametric method incorporates both additive and interaction effects between genes, which results in high predictive accuracy compared with other methods. In addition, our method provides model-free variable selection of important prognostic markers based on controlling the false discovery rates; thus providing a unified procedure to select relevant genes and predict survivor functions.


RESULTS
We assess the performance of our method several simulated and real microarray datasets. We show that our method selects genes potentially related to the development of the disease as well as yields predictive performance that is very competitive to many other existing methods.

a6f98b8ca92c5889d0c73c0ac328929b578b5154,Accounting for immunoprecipitation efficiencies in the statistical analysis of ChIP-seq data,"BackgroundImmunoPrecipitation (IP) efficiencies may vary largely between different antibodies and between repeated experiments with the same antibody. These differences have a large impact on the quality of ChIP-seq data: a more efficient experiment will necessarily lead to a higher signal to background ratio, and therefore to an apparent larger number of enriched regions, compared to a less efficient experiment. In this paper, we show how IP efficiencies can be explicitly accounted for in the joint statistical modelling of ChIP-seq data.ResultsWe fit a latent mixture model to eight experiments on two proteins, from two laboratories where different antibodies are used for the two proteins. We use the model parameters to estimate the efficiencies of individual experiments, and find that these are clearly different for the different laboratories, and amongst technical replicates from the same lab. When we account for ChIP efficiency, we find more regions bound in the more efficient experiments than in the less efficient ones, at the same false discovery rate. A priori knowledge of the same number of binding sites across experiments can also be included in the model for a more robust detection of differentially bound regions among two different proteins.ConclusionsWe propose a statistical model for the detection of enriched and differentially bound regions from multiple ChIP-seq data sets.

c8a16e90a37d2732406073d9d179dbc131b3e7bf,Widespread interictal epileptic discharge more likely than focal discharges to unveil the seizure onset zone in EEG-fMRI,"OBJECTIVE
We hypothesized that the number of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) during scan and their spatial extent are contributing factors in obtaining appropriate activations that reveal the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in EEG-fMRI.


METHODS
157 IED types, each corresponding to one EEG scalp distribution, in 64 consecutive EEG-fMRI studies from 64 patients with refractory localization-related epilepsy were reviewed. To determine reliable activation, we used the threshold corresponding to corrected whole-brain topological false discovery rate (FDR). The location with maximum activation was compared to the presumed SOZ as defined by a comprehensive evaluation for each patient.


RESULTS
The number of IEDs was significantly higher in the types with t-value above FDR than with t-value below FDR. The presumed SOZ could be delineated in 30 of the 64 patients. Among these patients, the types of IED concordant with the SOZ had significantly larger extent on scalp EEG than the IED types discordant with the SOZ.


CONCLUSIONS
The number of IEDs is important factor in obtaining reliable activations in EEG-fMRI. IEDs with larger spatial extent are more likely to reveal, on maximum BOLD, accurate location of the SOZ.


SIGNIFICANCE
Widespread discharges are more likely to yield a reliable activation for SOZ in EEG-fMRI.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tomohiro Yamazoe"", ids = ""2893952""); list(name = ""NicolÃ¡s von Ellenrieder"", ids = ""6971028""); list(name = ""Hui Ming Khoo"", ids = ""3153981""); list(name = ""Yao-Hsien Huang"", ids = ""48355838""); list(name = ""Jean Gotman"", ids = ""2071994"")",70eabb61f61ba9d7ec587196547b62fff1dc60a2,,Clinical Neurophysiology,130,429-438
5cd552e82a295470878e47993fb0f53251c36ef3,Association of genetic variants with myocardial infarction in Japanese individuals with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious clinical condition that is associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Although CKD has been recognised as a risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), genetic factors for predisposition to MI in individuals with CKD have remained largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to MI in Japanese individuals with CKD. The study subjects comprised 1,339 Japanese individuals with CKD, including 496 subjects with MI and 843 controls. The genotypes for 248 polymorphisms of 181 candidate genes were determined by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. An initial screen of allele frequencies by the chi-square test revealed that the 11496G-->A (Arg353Gln) polymorphism of F7 (rs6046) was significantly (false discovery rate <0.05) associated with the prevalence of MI in individuals with CKD. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates and a stepwise forward selection procedure also revealed that this polymorphism was significantly (p <0.005) associated with MI, with the variant A (Gln) allele protecting against this condition. Determination of genotype for the 11496G-->A (Arg353Gln) polymorphism of F7 may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for MI in individuals with CKD.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yutaka Nishigaki"", ids = ""6466382""); list(name = ""Masashi Tanaka"", ids = ""2065043""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Genjiro Kimura"", ids = ""144734121""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",7a0f33f2f9c1ab943cc40eade05922a3309ba0df; 78f42250f31592c2e60f8adedbc2059996468976; 120b33f95610ff61be30d6730697ec90693a4f86; 9c4c3de67dc31370a9831f3d93d5010636e5318f; c4f919c1ae93f1f0195caf02eedbc71cb6727def; 432dcf01850291943284045658cd7d17ec3bcc42; f1fbe57a82cf9ea40abed65e0e4a9d6ea479a08e; 4586e7676207b65f4e7933be863dec2a924872b8; 719422684b6857722b80cf9c73079d0043afd3c8; 459a65157592599544e150a74c2b68af2fc1e117; 4b54b402f135d96caba9c04659765f629cc7400b; b692607be4f875c72d58954630bf89956aacf978,88c2b48ce20b14a48a8b8d55a5be0b902ba07c7f; 66095997bec5a40ac13b9ef49fa88531772dd73c; 681f8896526f71101b46e151aff304977c66c45a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4adec7fee478931b353153eed839d59b14d6388c; cbc0e781d58473a3b15553ce7a47fc8d3ad7966d; bcf9ee127ada1eecc6a6a874464b55462a1f6bbc; 5d2c75338c3548ac6ea63d3b15eba30609a0e39a; c2914a25b0bd187c2523c34cb933c65bb4678c22; 885593b16bb2dee314ce925bd9f1e00131f9c9fb; 9e8e5d1b9f8d058adea5ea78234841d1101c86cb; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; a3d702092aa8bf0772bf59a87cc7d16fef421334; b3657aa076cc2920ffdb4e82d2a5abe27d222882; 8096c5bcf9200f42ad636122c4d872dda1f6093f; 7b300be44256aefde345fc4a16c0b01edef1bde9; 1438c30503c5f5717f03e0964ac33179ae3a876a; 4d8026ec9789b79051683adc84858e28d0746969; 1572a03e619648ff016d6497ea25597a21484a5f; 82f60d38090117a371d2c457e3347fb30dfd8d2b; 5e78431a9fa7a9fdbce0c9fd822f98475b436304; c55fc90beaea6e2f0c1ebe3cce17932b62f84254; 2198fa5d3cb58331f9ffcec9986febd98bc51562; bcb3dc2f6fb4c29a90fc711c61ce9f042f3e6171; e63297b87e2120d8c2dbf530be4f01d2c1a8606e; 0e01084882ab2522bea6d7b352e82d3a440c987f; cef81af456225af7327e11c32dd2d5b55b225911; 258d0052851edfd6a7425555ab4d7acaf6afd57f; 1ba494ceb331a9a56331a5e3021bb855307ef348,Thrombosis and haemostasis,101 5,"

Their effects at low doses comparable to human exposure, especially during critical windows of development remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of three prevalent environmental chemicals - diethyl phthalate (DEP), methyl paraben (MPB), triclosan (TCS) - and their mixture (MIX) on the transcriptome of normally developing mammary at low doses mimicking human exposure. Using a female Sprague-Dawley rat model, we targeted four early developmental exposure windows - prenatal, neonatal, prepubertal and pubertal, as well as continuous exposure from birth to adulthood (both parous and nulliparous). Control rats were exposed to vehicle only. All exposures were by oral gavage. Whole-transcriptomes of mammary glands were profiled by Affymetrix rat gene arrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified by linear models. Despite dynamic transcriptome changes in the normal developing mammary, exposure to environmental chemicals induced detectable gene expression changes in a window-specific fashion. We discovered that puberty represented a window of heightened sensitivity to MPB and DEP exposure with 341 and 175 altered genes relative to controls, respectively (false discovery rate (FDR) Citation Format: Kalpana Gopalakrishnan, Francesca Petralia, Pei Wang, Fabiana Manservisi, Laura Falcioni, Luciano Bua, Fiorella Belpoggi, Luca Lambertini, James Wetmur, Susan Teitelbaum, Jia Chen, Vasily Aushev.

65dadd20022931523ed98b2a96d16cdf366a51c9,Leukocyte CCR2 expression is associated with mini-mental state examination score in older adults.,"INTRODUCTION
Circulating inflammatory markers may play an important role in cognitive impairment at older ages. Mice deficient for the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) develop an accelerated Alzheimer-like pathology. CCR2 is also important in neurogenesis. To identify human gene transcripts most closely associated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, we undertook a genome-wide and inflammation specific transcriptome screen in circulating leukocytes from a population-based sample.


METHODS
We measured in vivo transcript levels by microarray analysis in 691 subjects (mean age 72.6 years) in the InCHIANTI study (Invecchiare in Chianti, aging in the Chianti area). We assessed expression associations with MMSE performance at RNA collection and prior 9-year change in MMSE score in linear regression models.


RESULTS
In genome-wide analysis, raised CCR2 expression was cross-sectionally the most strongly associated transcript with lower MMSE score (beta=-0.16, p=5.1Ã—10(-6), false discovery rate (FDR; q=0.077). Amongst inflammatory transcripts, only CCR2 expression was associated with both MMSE score and accelerated decline in score over the preceding 9 years (beta=-0.16, p=5.1Ã—10(-6), q=0.003; and beta=-0.13, p=5.5Ã—10(-5), q=0.03, respectively). CCR2 expression was also positively associated with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 Alzheimer disease risk haplotype.


CONCLUSIONS
We show for the first time that CCR2 expression is associated with lower MMSE scores in an older human population. Laboratory models of Ccr2-mediated Î²-amyloid removal and regulation of neurogenesis affecting cognitive function may be applicable in humans. CCR2-mediated pathways may provide a possible focus for intervention to potentiate protective reactions to Alzheimer pathology in older people, including for people with an adverse ApoE haplotype.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lorna W.

Modern neuroimaging developments have demonstrated that cognitive functions correlate with brain networks rather than specific areas. The purpose of this paper was to analyze the connectivity of Broca's area based on language tasks.


METHODS
A connectivity modeling study was performed by pooling data of Broca's activation in language tasks. Fifty-seven papers that included 883 subjects in 84 experiments were analyzed. Analysis of Likelihood Estimates of pooled data was utilized to generate the map; thresholds at p < 0.01 were corrected for multiple comparisons and false discovery rate. Resulting images were co-registered into MNI standard space.


RESULTS
A network consisting of 16 clusters of activation was obtained. Main clusters were located in the frontal operculum, left posterior temporal region, supplementary motor area, and the parietal lobe. Less common clusters were seen in the sub-cortical structures including the left thalamus, left putamen, secondary visual areas, and the right cerebellum.


CONCLUSION
Broca's area-44-related networks involved in language processing were demonstrated utilizing a pooling-data connectivity study. Significance, interpretation, and limitations of the results are discussed.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Byron Bernal"", ids = ""2042455""); list(name = ""Alfredo Ardila"", ids = ""144770912""); list(name = ""MÃ³nica Rosselli"", ids = ""50284812"")",3a31e6f43e1d94361171e9fbeaf1c766302929bd; 48b8af0766dece86616b3d74245b4c092e4869cc; 2e0f1121a38c5fcf337b85ec33a9e70ee62c704b; ae0193b1add43d89276150d4fb18b3750efea010; 348b18e6f1ab1fc838592cd23d31f73b4012f2e6; 58ca3927fc84596a0bc9172875c7c197d688bb56; ca5fea48f1d68d39808263abf9ed9a327e02936f; 03e57920235a56723ab3d4e0be65ceff5fbaff10; e9fd68eb3f7e4d1198fd37cf96bea6c6b43dd344; 1daec0bdb511e969db5879897eb368d10a0a9f90; 2de41c250b7f09a84fce7ade2d1bee8910f272a3; 6290e38ee74af0d0f94d21c3f651fbeb86167a43; 761332a3225da638668634210c8e68466e95a401; 220f78b538e083003c901cfa1af4f704452b5307; abe6cb07bccac284e3569f24d44f8e76d94c67f5,e0bc2590aba0897e7c75fa0ad1fa5801ed6854f5; 6ffe697926f2bbbeafa53a131c5550cab7556c4e; 229228e369b75d4e3e262b18b2fc0f638193ec6d; cb744122c8112635f2aef1aa1dbd13a629472aa8; 204d2bb5394c2942f27132ff1e7292449eb9d605; 835fc1ea47e87a6fae17ce7bcbcf241d55de7b10; 03c9e36f6f409583161a3cf509e752266f7b5c1b; ebaa14b539bcfe7e9327d3dddff6b76cb5792d39; 1a687e9964ace6c48d36205ad22a3839e9136983; 8c991848c255d3ae64d3acea769928fe37a97d54; 6848010d1f338fd7cc81053c2ff69b1bbc317812; 05a40bb04a825e1d3bef66eed8cbdd5659e0c4d7; b61f3bdf1cc3ec2b3a5d99c2501d8836fd97868b; a160f0a4550d515aca41b2d44698df07437cda14; 6fc456505aca09846a8d8bf629305d045b2e1fb2; 20e08e2cf0051d0c852206c7bbf853133279b345; 0de3b6fea1a38c851d9ad72d5ebaee6e52a1f77b; 0292b8defa49ceecbdbf9ead6ceb2527adf2d07d; 74c93d6356528631863f54b2e6dcf5ecdd44081a; 9773633490d054e59e67fdba8876b4789a8150a7; 472168bbd40e064e2a0f1b33320d22866ffd06b0; 9478d128baa8ded7b9785757a44e395c4d21f698; 661c6251f8a089c423b520542d22c5e20440895e; a9aa07000f48bf4cfe067f6ce6aacb68127ea910; 556cad44c211f0f0b9b5701ce0f340bcff3d3e2b; 25417533e3020094f32c73d0ec65d67186318c20; 9b9a6489172c1f564927c29b243276ad5ec131a8; 77c9f17040967c28626bad78728e693e431937ba; fe11ce9ab6ac6e0fc3081f660e62c0c8fdd54851; e1498cc2876a5154038ba4f80ae6ca17b81a573d; 29ff505474072637a081f690824876568a19a20a; 7282194a178f4179f51c0377b761917d0967039e; 6a7a070920da6e8b74c1890f734390d83e1b079b; 8aece24bd9110b173e158e3ba435d0e0b3e6f5d5; a9b9fea13b21790ed35643f27002f6ef778fd1a3; e31fce2875fb93d419729569480616e6c2712c99; 2a17334f575a3507081dfdf68b7ab643f841434e; 1bf46f5a122690c85a5193d1246fed7a3585df8e; a827b96af049c14c864850256deb0890435a8c16; 274749eb22b5b353f56f020a0358d00c339bb62b; 2b2fad216905b4f002d64ca748fdfb8db8a63d90; 62fdd61f4002f43b6051f9880abe7e9efbaedc9e; bde44323e6d2324ae1469c8c91b458b4009b1dc0; 721b1b6738b7bfcf57da623aace7e5578e5efd98; e6d108834b0e24265001ecea114904402b0bec0e; 3e1a632f30294540a82771569db6c713c745caef; bac7e1147e560651c495b8f5be86876975605fc6; 98487643d3477d73f5d739b42d59ae5b9ef06ee4; 0df0c3ec65fb5d73a4e7e0964f4913e08fda27ca; 2867887041341de0be1f51d89f06d6883d6574dc; 6d89a8cf74209e24782f226648907cfdd21810b4; 5df448fed45266a1ec4f8b5767be0e4bffaafcef; 24e6cdb2bb15892d7b6a55706fb687b174dd7eda; a2de57646e941e4a1c4e9c2a13ba1be716cf2a9f; ac36e5b6beebd9f35219ccdde70b2ae8e6ee7d3e; 7b4ee2287d47f58b876c71efa2f49b27766b774b,Frontiers in Psychology,6,
c21f4c18024f3eb3be209a11a73b232c238c4089,Linking late cognitive outcome with glioma surgery location using resection cavity maps,"Patients with a diffuse glioma may experience cognitive decline or improvement upon resective surgery. To examine the impact of glioma location, cognitive alteration after glioma surgery was quantified and related to voxel-based resection probability maps. A total of 59 consecutive patients (range 18-67 years of age) who had resective surgery between 2006 and 2011 for a supratentorial nonenhancing diffuse glioma (grade I-III, WHO 2007) were included in this observational cohort study. Standardized neuropsychological examination and MRI were obtained before and after surgery. Intraoperative stimulation mapping guided resections towards neurological functions (language, sensorimotor function, and visual fields). Maps of resected regions were constructed in standard space. These resection cavity maps were compared between patients with and without new cognitive deficits (z-score difference >1.5 SD between baseline and one year after resection), using a voxel-wise randomization test and calculation of false discovery rates. Brain regions significantly associated with cognitive decline were classified in standard cortical and subcortical anatomy. Cognitive improvement in any domain occurred in 10 (17%) patients, cognitive decline in any domain in 25 (42%), and decline in more than one domain in 10 (17%). The most frequently affected subdomains were attention in 10 (17%) patients and information processing speed in 9 (15%). Resection regions associated with decline in more than one domain were predominantly located in the right hemisphere. For attention decline, no specific region could be identified. For decline in information speed, several regions were found, including the frontal pole and the corpus callosum. Cognitive decline after resective surgery of diffuse glioma is prevalent, in particular, in patients with a tumor located in the right hemisphere without cognitive function mapping.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eef J Hendriks"", ids = ""5565682""); list(name = ""Esther J J Habets"", ids = ""3896730""); list(name = ""Martin J.

19b0c1c501abcf09e396602da00217964b407afc,On spike and slab empirical Bayes multiple testing,"This paper explores a connection between empirical Bayes posterior distributions and false discovery rate (FDR) control.

2ee0e7fe90a62f3a6e6db4f76b3af05fc9b042be,Whole blood transcriptional profiling in ankylosing spondylitis identifies novel candidate genes that might contribute to the inflammatory and tissue-destructive disease aspects,"IntroductionA number of genetic-association studies have identified genes contributing to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) susceptibility but such approaches provide little information as to the gene activity changes occurring during the disease process. Transcriptional profiling generates a 'snapshot' of the sampled cells' activity and thus can provide insights into the molecular processes driving the disease process. We undertook a whole-genome microarray approach to identify candidate genes associated with AS and validated these gene-expression changes in a larger sample cohort.MethodsA total of 18 active AS patients, classified according to the New York criteria, and 18 gender- and age-matched controls were profiled using Illumina HT-12 whole-genome expression BeadChips which carry cDNAs for 48,000 genes and transcripts. Class comparison analysis identified a number of differentially expressed candidate genes. These candidate genes were then validated in a larger cohort using qPCR-based TaqMan low density arrays (TLDAs).ResultsA total of 239 probes corresponding to 221 genes were identified as being significantly different between patients and controls with a P-value <0.0005 (80% confidence level of false discovery rate). Forty-seven genes were then selected for validation studies, using the TLDAs. Thirteen of these genes were validated in the second patient cohort with 12 downregulated 1.3- to 2-fold and only 1 upregulated (1.6-fold). Among a number of identified genes with well-documented inflammatory roles we also validated genes that might be of great interest to the understanding of AS progression such as SPOCK2 (osteonectin) and EP300, which modulate cartilage and bone metabolism.ConclusionsWe have validated a gene expression signature for AS from whole blood and identified strong candidate genes that may play roles in both the inflammatory and joint destruction aspects of the disease.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fernando M Pimentel-Santos"", ids = ""1397761718""); list(name = ""DÃ¡rio Ligeiro"", ids = ""3928505""); list(name = ""Mafalda Matos"", ids = ""46472657""); list(name = ""Ana Filipa MourÃ£o"", ids = ""2057240""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Antonio GimÃ©nez Costa"", ids = ""145122388""); list(name = ""Helena Santos"", ids = ""144966344""); list(name = ""Anabela Barcelos"", ids = ""3137577""); list(name = ""FÃ¡tima Godinho"", ids = ""2658823""); list(name = ""PatrÃ­cia Pinto"", ids = ""144639736""); list(name = ""Margarida Cruz"", ids = ""46633713""); list(name = ""JoÃ£o Eurico Fonseca"", ids = ""1849344""); list(name = ""Henrique Guedes-Pinto"", ids = ""1397761694""); list(name = ""Jaime C.

4d11b33a8c82e8ef8dacff4e7ce413f65c62d904,Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis revisited,"A widely used technique for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which determines the convergence of foci reported from different experiments. ALE analysis involves modelling these foci as probability distributions whose width is based on empirical estimates of the spatial uncertainty due to the between-subject and between-template variability of neuroimaging data. ALE results are assessed against a null-distribution of random spatial association between experiments, resulting in random-effects inference. In the present revision of this algorithm, we address two remaining drawbacks of the previous algorithm. First, the assessment of spatial association between experiments was based on a highly time-consuming permutation test, which nevertheless entailed the danger of underestimating the right tail of the null-distribution. In this report, we outline how this previous approach may be replaced by a faster and more precise analytical method. Second, the previously applied correction procedure, i.e. controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), is supplemented by new approaches for correcting the family-wise error rate and the cluster-level significance. The different alternatives for drawing inference on meta-analytic results are evaluated on an exemplary dataset on face perception as well as discussed with respect to their methodological limitations and advantages. In summary, we thus replaced the previous permutation algorithm with a faster and more rigorous analytical solution for the null-distribution and comprehensively address the issue of multiple-comparison corrections. The proposed revision of the ALE-algorithm should provide an improved tool for conducting coordinate-based meta-analyses on functional imaging data.",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Simon B.

678e5c92b0f05b350c8c3d538267620322397b11,Transcriptome analyses suggest a disturbance of iron homeostasis in soybean leaves during white mould disease establishment.,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a serious pathogen of numerous crops around the world. The major virulence factor of this pathogen is oxalic acid (OA). Mutants that cannot produce OA do not cause disease, and plants that express enzymes that degrade OA, such as oxalate oxidase (OxO), are very resistant to S.â€‰sclerotiorum. To examine the effect of OA on plants, we infiltrated soybean leaves with 5â€‰mm OA and examined the gene expression changes at 2â€‰h post-infiltration. By comparing the gene expression levels between leaves of a transgenic soybean carrying an OxO gene (OxO) and its parent AC Colibri (AC) infiltrated with OA (pHâ€‰2.4) or water (pHâ€‰2.4 or 5.5), we were able to compare the effects of OA dependent or independent of its pH. Gene expression by microarray analysis identified 2390 genes that showed changes in expression, as determined using an overall F-test P-value cut-off of 0.001. The additional requirement that at least one pairwise t-test false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P value should be less than 0.001 reduced the list of the most highly significant differentially expressed genes to 1054. Independent of pH, OA altered the expression levels of 78 genes, with ferritin showing the strongest induction by OA. The combination of OA plus its low pH caused 1045 genes (99% of all significant genes) to be differentially expressed, with many of the up-regulated genes being related to basal defence, such as genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway and various cytochrome P450s. RNA-seq was also conducted on four samples: OxO and AC genotypes infiltrated with either OA pHâ€‰2.4 or water pHâ€‰2.4. The RNA-seq analysis also identified ferritin paralogues as being strongly induced by OA. As the expression of ferritin, a gene that encodes for an iron storage protein, is induced by free iron, these results suggest that S.â€‰sclerotiorum benefits from the ability of OA to free iron from plant proteins, as this induces host cell death, and also allows the uptake and assimilation of the iron for its own metabolic needs.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bernarda Calla"", ids = ""5903842""); list(name = ""Laureen Blahut-Beatty"", ids = ""1414035436""); list(name = ""Lisa Koziol"", ids = ""32617061""); list(name = ""Daina H.

25e75fd79115b498167a2a8bb970862cd49165c8,Radiomics: is it time to compose the puzzle?,"Following the introduction of the term â€œRadiomicsâ€, proposed to imply the â€œComprehensive quantification of disease phenotypes by applying a large number of quantitative image features representing lesion heterogeneity and correlating with omics and clinical dataâ€ [1], the scientific literature has been flooded by a continuously increasing number of studies on this topic. In fact, such an approach to the analysis of medical images had been adopted even before the term radiomics was coined. In some high impact studies, the potential of image features to measure lesion heterogeneity by the use of advanced image analytics (e.g., texture analysis) had been demonstrated, proving statistically significant correlation between imaging features and known â€œomicsâ€ prognostic factors and/or clinical endpoints, in patients with similar cancer diagnosis, e.g., [2, 3]. With radiomics, a revival of the role of in vivo medical imaging in the anti-cancer scene is seen, overlapping the Genomics era, in which Genomics seemed to be the only possible precision approach to win the cancer challenge. Moreover, ex vivo Genomics sequencing on sample biopsies is susceptible to tissue sampling errors possibly missing detection of intra-tumor heterogeneity and consequently misleading Genomic profiles [4]. The possibility of studying cancer heterogeneity by 3D imaging of an entire lesion, in vivo, and by means of existing imaging technologies, has brought molecular imaging on the scene of personalized medicine. Many research groups applied the radiomics approach to their retrospective oncological studies, given the immediate availability of both imaging and clinical follow-up data. Most of these exploratory studies were successful in finding a number of radiomics features correlated to clinical endopoints, in some studies allowing to stratify patients in different prognostic groups. Due to their retrospective nature, because of the lack of genetic analysis, very few studies allowed to investigate the correlation of the image traits with the Genomic profiles of the patients. The majority of studies adopted compromise solutions, such as histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis instead of Genomics. However, this enthusiastic rush into a new research field results in a build-up of experimental and analytical work, prior to the consolidation of standardized and validated methodologies. On the one hand, many results in the literature have been obtained disregarding relevant methodological issues (a disruptive paper on this topic that is worthy of wide diffusion and reading is the one on the high risk of false discovery rate in radiomics studies [5]). On the other hand, such a scientific gym has its advantages, forcing the field to grow. A variety of results have certainly emerged, some confirmed, others contradicted, however, generally highlighting the most critical issues for a clinical translation of radiomics. First of all, radiomics has focused attention on the need to integrate such an unprecedented amount of different skills so far and on the complexity of this cultural change. The multidisciplinary work involves the collaboration of physicians (radiologists, nuclear physicians, oncologists and other specialists), not only with biologists, physicists, and bioengineers, but, more and more, with computer scientists, biostatisticians and experts in bioinformatics. These latter expertises appear predominant in radiomics and this is perhaps the greatest novelty compared to the past. Extremely, as in [6], the images â€œare more than pictures: they are dataâ€ and, we can hazard, they escape the radiologists â€œvisual inspectionâ€. This unexpected change can perhaps be compared to what happened to biologists with the advent of Genomic analyses by high-throughput sequencing platforms. The amount of data extracted from these platforms is such that the now well-consolidated term â€œbig dataâ€ was coined in medicine. Here, in radiomics, the number of features which can be extracted is so * Isabella Castiglioni isabella.castiglioni@ibfm.cnr.it",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Isabella Castiglioni"", ids = ""48816625""); list(name = ""Maria Carla Gilardi"", ids = ""145407843"")",d6d15eec0813c8fc6c85a7a1c251fc266ad71ff5,43bec47e06ac7bdbabc68128f9d664d2eaf8d0db; ebe14ab38c7bc8187737c8aed7fef3d7cd2becf7; 73c5ac2e88c43707da0314dcbd496429ecf6114a; 9971ff92d9d09b4736228bdbd7726e2e19b9aa2d; dcd99d49af33bd14e9e0750bcf854e7b306c808a; 48fb1478379fa3dd70fe4e09af80b6fd3c82edf7; 72b72ea713217e12bfbd98da37860ef81e87f523; 662d621778b291b6170ee03a2c698d397dca1b10; 314486b75722cd80dc8ffc16c7b18e290535e97e; 4f8d648c52edf74e41b0996128aa536e13cc7e82; 2250987c4512b68a766da8accaf19a2f96789dc9; 1cacf3b37b71fddd4cbed4338a05aa670d1062ce; a148831d1162c427dd9f35bdf8a525458f4e54f7; c53fa445bee435f567828db3a0ede0f08abdd0d5,Clinical and Translational Imaging,6,411 - 413
0d883d61e6caa4aca59e92c89c849a1d37370770,A parsimonious statistical method to detect groupwise differentially expressed functional connectivity networks.,"Group-level functional connectivity analyses often aim to detect the altered connectivity patterns between subgroups with different clinical or psychological experimental conditions, for example, comparing cases and healthy controls. We present a new statistical method to detect differentially expressed connectivity networks with significantly improved power and lower false-positive rates. The goal of our method was to capture most differentially expressed connections within networks of constrained numbers of brain regions (by the rule of parsimony). By virtue of parsimony, the false-positive individual connectivity edges within a network are effectively reduced, whereas the informative (differentially expressed) edges are allowed to borrow strength from each other to increase the overall power of the network.

Each data stream may have its own change point at which the underlying probability distribution of its data changes, and the decision maker needs to declare, sequentially, which data streams have passed their change points. With a large number of parallel data streams, the error metric is the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected ratio of the number of falsely declared data streams to the total number of declared data streams. A data stream is falsely declared if the detected change point is ahead of its actual change point. Decision procedures that are guaranteed to control the FDR level are developed, and it is also shown that the average decision delays (ADDs) of these decision procedures do not grow with the number of data streams. Numerical simulations and case studies are conducted to corroborate the analytical results, and to illustrate the utility of the decision procedures.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jie Chen"", ids = ""47740630""); list(name = ""Wenyi Zhang"", ids = ""49039618""); list(name = ""H.

However, how stress influences obesity remains unclear. We conducted an epigenome-wide DNA methylation association analysis of obesity (N=510) and examined whether cumulative stress influenced the DNA methylation on body weight. We identified 20 CpG sites associated with body mass index at the false discovery rate q<0.05, including a novel site, cg18181703, in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) gene (coefficient Î²=-0.0022, FDR q=4.94Ã—10-5). The interaction between cg18181703 and cumulative adverse life stress contributed to variations in body weight (p=0.002). Individuals with at least five major life events and lower methylation of cg1818703 showed a 1.38-fold higher risk of being obese (95%CI: 1.17-1.76).

0a61875dda68090bad1d5ea509ba3e6df0e20bf5,Gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of Chinese nickel refinery workers with high exposures to nickel and control subjects.,"BACKGROUND
Occupational exposure to nickel (Ni) is associated with an increased risk of lung and nasal cancers. Ni compounds exhibit weak mutagenic activity, alter the cell's epigenetic homeostasis, and activate signaling pathways. However, changes in gene expression associated with Ni exposure have only been investigated in vitro. This study was conducted in a Chinese population to determine whether occupational exposure to Ni was associated with differential gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of Ni-refinery workers when compared with referents.


METHODS
Eight Ni-refinery workers and ten referents were selected. PBMC RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was conducted using Affymetrix exon arrays. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between both groups were identified in a global analysis.


RESULTS
There were a total of 2,756 DEGs in the Ni-refinery workers relative to the referents [false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P < 0.05] with 770 upregulated genes and 1,986 downregulated genes. DNA repair and epigenetic genes were significantly overrepresented (P < 0.0002) among the DEGs. Of 31 DNA repair genes, 29 were repressed in the Ni-refinery workers and 2 were overexpressed. Of the 16 epigenetic genes, 12 were repressed in the Ni-refinery workers and 4 were overexpressed.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study indicate that occupational exposure to Ni is associated with alterations in gene expression profiles in PBMCs of subjects.

5c3c6a8641dcf09afed9e4af07fc952708daeee7,Statistical Estimation and Testing via the Sorted ` 1 Norm,"We introduce a novel method for sparse regression and variable selection, which is inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. Imagine we have observations from the linear model y = XÎ²+ z, then we suggest estimating the regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called SLOPE, which is the solution to minimize b 1 2â€–y âˆ’Xbâ€– 2 `2 + Î»1|b|(1) + Î»2|b|(2) + . . .+ Î»p|b|(p); here, Î»1 â‰¥ Î»2 â‰¥ . . . â‰¥ Î»p and |b|(1) â‰¥ |b|(2) â‰¥ . . . â‰¥ |b|(p) is the order statistics of the magnitudes of b. In short, the regularizer is a sorted `1 norm which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rankâ€”the closer to the topâ€”the larger the penalty. This is similar to the famous Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BHq) [9], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a family to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. SLOPE is a convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the solution. We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking Î»i = F âˆ’1(1âˆ’ qi) (F is the cumulative distribution function of the errors), qi = iq/(2p), controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection. This holds under the assumption that the errors are i.i.d. symmetric and continuous random variables. When the design matrix is nonorthogonal there are inherent limitations on the FDR level and the power which can be obtained with model selection methods based on `1-like penalties. However, whenever the columns of the design matrix are not strongly correlated, we demonstrate empirically that it is possible to select the parameters Î»i as to obtain FDR control at a reasonable level as long as the number of nonzero coefficients is not too large. At the same time, the procedure exhibits increased power over the lasso, which treats all coefficients equally. The paper illustrates further estimation properties of the new selection rule through comprehensive simulation studies.",2013,,"list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""144726010""); list(name = ""Ewout van den Berg"", ids = ""3258079""); list(name = ""Weijie Su"", ids = ""145499378""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

bb742a0df1742ef19166e64eec16315412e03e34,qvality: non-parametric estimation of q-values and posterior error probabilities,"UNLABELLED
Qvality is a C++ program for estimating two types of standard statistical confidence measures: the q-value, which is an analog of the p-value that incorporates multiple testing correction, and the posterior error probability (PEP, also known as the local false discovery rate), which corresponds to the probability that a given observation is drawn from the null distribution. In computing q-values, qvality employs a standard bootstrap procedure to estimate the prior probability of a score being from the null distribution; for PEP estimation, qvality relies upon non-parametric logistic regression. Relative to other tools for estimating statistical confidence measures, qvality is unique in its ability to estimate both types of scores directly from a null distribution, without requiring the user to calculate p-values.

2910cb80cd73748bb9518109511b1816ac4fa535,Transfer posterior error probability estimation for peptide identification,"In shotgun proteomics, database searching of tandem mass spectra results in a great number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), many of which are false positives. Quality control of PSMs is a multiple hypothesis testing problem, and the false discovery rate (FDR) or the posterior error probability (PEP) is the commonly used statistical confidence measure. PEP, also called local FDR, can evaluate the confidence of individual PSMs and thus is more desirable than FDR, which evaluates the global confidence of a collection of PSMs. Estimation of PEP can be achieved by decomposing the null and alternative distributions of PSM scores as long as the given data is sufficient. However, in many proteomic studies, only a group (subset) of PSMs, e.g. those with specific post-translational modifications, are of interest. The group can be very small, making the direct PEP estimation by the group data inaccurate, especially for the high-score area where the score threshold is taken. Using the whole set of PSMs to estimate the group PEP is inappropriate either, because the null and/or alternative distributions of the group can be very different from those of combined scores. The transfer PEP algorithm is proposed to more accurately estimate the PEPs of peptide identifications in small groups. Transfer PEP derives the group null distribution through its empirical relationship with the combined null distribution, and estimates the group alternative distribution, as well as the null proportion, using an iterative semi-parametric method. Validated on both simulated data and real proteomic data, transfer PEP showed remarkably higher accuracy than the direct combined and separate PEP estimation methods. We presented a novel approach to group PEP estimation for small groups and implemented it for the peptide identification problem in proteomics. The methodology of the approach is in principle applicable to the small-group PEP estimation problems in other fields.",2020,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinpei Yi"", ids = ""51101724""); list(name = ""Fuzhou Gong"", ids = ""50654631""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817033"")",,,BMC Bioinformatics,21,
719a22885d22643147e7c3441c0819e28257ca16,Evaluation of autoantibody profiles in a cohort of new-onset pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus patients using autoantigen microarray technology,"Purpose Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the production of autoantibodies directed against many highly-conserved nuclear antigens. 15% of SLE patients develop disease in childhood or adolescence, and pediatric (pSLE) patients often have more severe disease onset and organ system involvement. Antigen microarray technology allows the comprehensive analysis of autoantibodies directed against hundreds of antigens with minimal amounts of sera. The purpose of this study was to characterize autoantibody profiles in a prospective cohort of new-onset pSLE patients at onset and within 6-9 months of disease onset and to determine if autoantibody profiles differentiate patients with distinct clinical manifestations such as nephritis. Methods New-onset pediatric rheumatology patients meeting the revised ACR diagnostic criteria for SLE were eligible for this study. The study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. Sera from 51 pSLE patients and 17 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were evaluated using an 1128-feature antigen microarray manufactured with approximately 130 antigens. Demographic and clinical data from corresponding clinic visits were collected. Microarrays were probed with 1:200 dilutions of serum and a Cy5-conjugated goat-antihuman IgG secondary antibody, scanned with a GenePix 4000 scanner, and analyzed using GenePix 6.1 software to determine median fluorescence intensity minus background for each antigen. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software was used to determine differences in autoantibody expression between pSLE patients and controls, within the pSLE group over time, and between pSLE patients with and without nephritis. Results SAM identified increased reactivity against more than 50 autoantigens in new-onset pSLE patients compared to controls, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1%. Reactivity against many of these antigens decreased significantly by 6-9 months from disease onset. Subgroup analysis comparing patients with class III or IV Iupus nephritis to patients without significant nephritis demonstrated increased reactivity against several autoantigens including double stranded DNA, C1q and several types of collagen in patients with nephritis. Conversely, patients without significant nephritis had increased reactivity against other antigens including heat shock proteins and desmoglein. Conclusion New-onset pSLE patients have a broad spectrum of antibodies directed against many autoantigens, including those not classically associated with SLE. In addition, preliminary subgroup analysis of pSLE patients with and without nephritis revealed distinct autoantibody profiles between the two groups. Further studies are currently underway to validate these findings and evaluate additional subgroups of patients with various clinical manifestations. Ultimately, autoantibody profiles may identify important biomarkers for more accurate diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of pSLE patients.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Imelda M.

f0951cdf323235d05df630e0ec0cd045eb96152c,Genomic Divergence during Speciation Driven by Adaptation to Altitude,"Even though Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" implied selection being the main driver of species formation, the role of natural selection in speciation remains poorly understood. In particular, it remains unclear how selection at a few genes can lead to genomewide divergence and the formation of distinct species. We used a particularly attractive clear-cut case of recent plant ecological speciation to investigate the demography and genomic bases of species formation driven by adaptation to contrasting conditions. High-altitude Senecio aethnensis and low-altitude S. chrysanthemifolius live at the extremes of a mountain slope on Mt. Etna, Sicily, and form a hybrid zone at intermediate altitudes but remain morphologically distinct. Genetic differentiation of these species was analyzed at the DNA polymorphism and gene expression levels by high-throughput sequencing of transcriptomes from multiple individuals. Out of â‰ˆ 18,000 genes analyzed, only a small number (90) displayed differential expression between the two species. These genes showed significantly elevated species differentiation (FST and Dxy), consistent with diversifying selection acting on these genes. Genomewide genetic differentiation of the species is surprisingly low (FST = 0.19), while â‰ˆ 200 genes showed significantly higher (false discovery rate < 1%; mean outlier FST > 0.6) interspecific differentiation and evidence for local adaptation. Diversifying selection at only a handful of loci may be enough for the formation and maintenance of taxonomically well-defined species, despite ongoing gene flow. This provides an explanation of why many closely related species (in plants, in particular) remain phenotypically and ecologically distinct despite ongoing hybridization, a question that has long puzzled naturalists and geneticists alike.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark A Chapman"", ids = ""145261911""); list(name = ""Simon J.

628f62241eb3b9b99cc424095f55ed15f98c5478,Estimating the number of true null hypotheses in multiple hypothesis testing,"The overall Type I error computed based on the traditional means may be inflated if many hypotheses are compared simultaneously. The family-wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) are some of commonly used error rates to measure Type I error under the multiple hypothesis setting. Many controlling FWER and FDR procedures have been proposed and have the ability to control the desired FWER/FDR under certain scenarios. Nevertheless, these controlling procedures become too conservative when only some hypotheses are from the null. Benjamini and Hochberg (J. Educ. Behav. Stat. 25:60â€“83, 2000) proposed an adaptive FDR-controlling procedure that adapts the information of the number of true null hypotheses (m0) to overcome this problem. Since m0 is unknown, estimators of m0 are needed. Benjamini and Hochberg (J.Â Educ. Behav. Stat. 25:60â€“83, 2000) suggested a graphical approach to construct an estimator of m0, which is shown to overestimate m0 (see Hwang in J.Â Stat. Comput. Simul. 81:207â€“220, 2011). Following a similar construction, this paper proposes new estimators of m0. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate accuracy and precision of new estimators and the feasibility of these new adaptive procedures is evaluated under various simulation settings.",2014,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yi-Ting Hwang"", ids = ""2223332""); list(name = ""Hsun-Chih Kuo"", ids = ""3024305""); list(name = ""Chun-Chao Wang"", ids = ""2123562""); list(name = ""Meng Feng Lee"", ids = ""10981557"")",938eff019de1114b2848f4a81103545ed543289c; 2d98efbb714ded221d4e7a380b1e728ec65fa900; 628f62241eb3b9b99cc424095f55ed15f98c5478; b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c; b2cf876ee71652fcc5d79a771cc6268eb9dfe179,68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 203b6a2b510075b63a79570887c681fb9e4b8208; 628f62241eb3b9b99cc424095f55ed15f98c5478; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; dfc1446c5d5034bdb9294a34c42a8f360dd93207; 1cb39181865cb77f744b06692a9ccea3f4738392; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 395336f1f0e611a79fe56f61ebac671ef48caa45; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f1e7570781fba2ac576049f589308fcf794ec768; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 5796c81a64d3ffec0cf7d9d79b092ea070db47f0; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; abb79b031800acb821b037c98f37ac86d78538d3; 604ee9ce5a7daa35020171b80b23f82eb7b3378a; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 1973f94f357cbffa8e845c7e13e630382c1d83e7; e74b906b0af21df55a51c779495cc8f0fdb2fbfa; 514de7fd03e14cf5b557b859fddaab2277e45850; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412,Statistics and Computing,24,399-416
47959fd9bd46f9a60cc533fba971f3a750fb1c85,Alterations of the Gut Microbiome in Hypertension,"Introduction: Human gut microbiota is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. However, the identification and functional status of the hypertension-related gut microbe(s) have not yet been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Methods: Here we characterized the gut microbiome in hypertension status by comparing fecal samples of 60 patients with primary hypertension and 60 gender-, age-, and body weight-matched healthy controls based on whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing. Results: Hypertension implicated a remarkable gut dysbiosis with significant reduction in within-sample diversity and shift in microbial composition. Metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) revealed 53,953 microbial genes that differ in distribution between the patients and healthy controls (false discovery rate, 0.05) and can be grouped into 68 clusters representing bacterial species. Opportunistic pathogenic taxa, such as, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp., and Parabacteroides merdae were frequently distributed in hypertensive gut microbiome, whereas the short-chain fatty acid producer, such as, Roseburia spp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were higher in controls. The number of hypertension-associated species also showed stronger correlation to the severity of disease. Functionally, the hypertensive gut microbiome exhibited higher membrane transport, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and steroid degradation, while in controls the metabolism of amino acid, cofactors and vitamins was found to be higher. We further provided the microbial markers for disease discrimination and achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78, demonstrating the potential of gut microbiota in prediction of hypertension. Conclusion: These findings represent specific alterations in microbial diversity, genes, species and functions of the hypertensive gut microbiome. Further studies on the causality relationship between hypertension and gut microbiota will offer new prospects for treating and preventing the hypertension and its associated diseases.",2017,Biology;

Approximately 30% of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients do not respond significantly to antidepressants such as paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, the biological mechanisms behind this phenomenon are mostly unknown. Here, we examined the role of patients' epigenetic background in SSRI efficacy. Methods: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the peripheral blood of Japanese MDD patients was performed by using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Results: We compared the results of the 10 patients who best responded to paroxetine (BR) with the 10 worst responders (WR), and found 623 CpG sites with a >10% difference in DNA methylation level. Among them, 218 sites were nominally significant between BR and WR (p < 0.05), and 2 sites (cg00594917 and cg07260927) were significantly different after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (q < 0.05). The methylation difference was greatest at cg00594917, located in the first exon of the PPFIA4 gene, which codes for liprin-Î± (p = 0.00012). Hierarchical cluster analysis of 23 CpG sites in the PPFIA4 gene distinguished BR and WR, except for 1 WR patient. The cg07260927 site was located in the 5â€²UTR of the heparin sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 1 (HS3ST1) gene (p = 0.00013). Hierarchical cluster analysis of 28 CpG sites in HS3ST1 distinguished BR and WR, except for 1 WR and 2 BR patients. Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients' DNA methylation profile at specific genes such as PPFIA4 and HS3ST1 is associated with individual variations in therapeutic responses to paroxetine.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Naohiro Takeuchi"", ids = ""50505016""); list(name = ""Shinpei Nonen"", ids = ""5127323""); list(name = ""Masaki Kato"", ids = ""2341094""); list(name = ""Masataka Wakeno"", ids = ""4984319""); list(name = ""Y Takekita"", ids = ""145973186""); list(name = ""Toshihiko Kinoshita"", ids = ""1702904""); list(name = ""Fumihiko Kugawa"", ids = ""3522757"")",d7986163f944240a3632c00438d9b377cc8157c9; 6a1a6133857526d8f9bbd25fc627bd2dda01568f,5388a0d313c8cc70c5608b1841222d64c5a6b259; 587e8b81ff4687d9795d3bfbe2b476c535556430; 88c66f5886b99076899355d24ded4f8c6dd689e5; 64c3979f1f76d5fb3d9e00fa58bf9641f25f5535; d1544d73bab30dbcfb1dac4353ccdc1b20b73599; 67ad87adb1780fc466aa3b262dd18917486804ab; 5423ae0220dc05cca5d54b3fca7da3fdbf3e8adc; 5d7a3b8d651150d968c4e5a6b92e3d6546cc74da; bf9a422fcf1ea25573612eb774bc87ee2aeb2a65; c06dca16f28474661fa0afd8eed724c34d3b85ba; 00133b61c66684098bf66605121ad38300c9a79e; 75cd7ed5c912f7be3327df890c45ccf48bc9e9e1; 6bdc41dc554d6c4d9bc83d000b420a6704f121b3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 00c16b854d1c6f0131cb871e3b2599e712df679c; 86c9f0c83b30a4ccdc98ddb5bfc2a3601094b983; 7c007f592f44de9cb3448457c7ef008fd7473f5e; 2069727e1695e2a88a05f75b7643e26acf449ebf; 8b589790e646b9a751560c9dba0715d053cf50bc; e0e85c82282d3869e29c8442e9a9c700c0b3c3e8; 4713ac9828e0cee2a28df34e3a52abadf0afb577; ac3d6f1cbb34b8a7b7a49bf8a1c8bb1d1d8cf171; 12ce5d48ab5c8f59e47d791fd0840d9c1a9b9bdb; 6910df34013d12386a154a98e69dd6a22e51383a; c7e6d7b8733bf66072db0c20fdac5dfdf95eee23; df15e6fc063aee2585add6f9ccb4a8b1686c4110; 6c13c2a6e9ab93cbc564aa6aac6a3f09fa77309c; b0015f6a55f8cbb524f8f1cebfa8ca50c1239996; d160611525091ab45f0fdbc6d3a6d802eaf7d396; 6f878a50c9020fbbba052321e2017f26b463ee11; a6b0832b826b1331a7e83b6b1794aa06830c9c43; 1a98431555e47a714b749b4bc1be74b05b17012a; 5218ab353ee8c08a23ef666753568bccdf0c2fcd,Neuropsychobiology,75,81 - 88
78367e29a007cc8a3295ec4593e404b8ae795ffa,The Salivary Secretome of the Tsetse Fly Glossina pallidipes (Diptera: Glossinidae) Infected by Salivary Gland Hypertrophy Virus,"BACKGROUND
The competence of the tsetse fly Glossina pallidipes (Diptera; Glossinidae) to acquire salivary gland hypertrophy virus (SGHV), to support virus replication and successfully transmit the virus depends on complex interactions between Glossina and SGHV macromolecules. Critical requisites to SGHV transmission are its replication and secretion of mature virions into the fly's salivary gland (SG) lumen. However, secretion of host proteins is of equal importance for successful transmission and requires cataloging of G. pallidipes secretome proteins from hypertrophied and non-hypertrophied SGs.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
After electrophoretic profiling and in-gel trypsin digestion, saliva proteins were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS. MaxQuant/Andromeda search of the MS data against the non-redundant (nr) GenBank database and a G. morsitans morsitans SG EST database, yielded a total of 521 hits, 31 of which were SGHV-encoded. On a false discovery rate limit of 1% and detection threshold of least 2 unique peptides per protein, the analysis resulted in 292 Glossina and 25 SGHV MS-supported proteins. When annotated by the Blast2GO suite, at least one gene ontology (GO) term could be assigned to 89.9% (285/317) of the detected proteins. Five (âˆ¼1.8%) Glossina and three (âˆ¼12%) SGHV proteins remained without a predicted function after blast searches against the nr database. Sixty-five of the 292 detected Glossina proteins contained an N-terminal signal/secretion peptide sequence. Eight of the SGHV proteins were predicted to be non-structural (NS), and fourteen are known structural (VP) proteins.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
SGHV alters the protein expression pattern in Glossina. The G. pallidipes SG secretome encompasses a spectrum of proteins that may be required during the SGHV infection cycle. These detected proteins have putative interactions with at least 21 of the 25 SGHV-encoded proteins. Our findings opens venues for developing novel SGHV mitigation strategies to block SGHV infections in tsetse production facilities such as using SGHV-specific antibodies and phage display-selected gut epithelia-binding peptides.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Henry M Kariithi"", ids = ""4378569""); list(name = ""Ikbal Agah Ince"", ids = ""120406038""); list(name = ""Sjef Boeren"", ids = ""144953605""); list(name = ""Adly M.

However, how these biomaterials alter gene expression is poorly understood. The problem of identifying genes that are differentially expressed across varying biological conditions or in response to different biomaterials based on microarray data is a typical multiple testing problem. In this paper, we focus on FDR control for large-scale multiple testing problems, by our proposed statistics and resampling method, a powerful FDR controlling procedure for large-scale multiple testing problems is provided. Simulations show that, our Fiducial estimator is accurate and stable than other five traditional methods, with satisfactory FDR control. In particular, we propose a generally applicable estimate of the proposed procedure for identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments. This microarray method consistently shows favorable performance over the existing methods. For example, in testing for differential expression between two breast cancer tumor types, the proposed procedure provides increases from 37% to 127% in the number of genes called significant at a false discovery rate of 3%.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pei Jin"", ids = ""72326757""); list(name = ""Jian Zhang"", ids = ""1679327"")",,83829d31cd18317ce12a8a0fcd71126b817cb96e; 04ca08a80bcd972baa3ef89441f3749f99e8e0b2; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307,Advanced Materials Research,311-313,1661 - 1666

Dysfunctional adipose tissue plays an important role in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying adipocyte dysfunction are incompletely understood.


AIM
The aim of the study was to identify differentially regulated pathways in sc adipocytes of dyslipidemic subjects.


METHODS
Whole-genome expression profiling was conducted on sc adipocytes from a discovery group of nine marginally overweight subjects with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) and nine controls of comparable body sizes as well as two independent confirmation groups. In this study, FCHL served as a model of familial insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, in the absence of frank obesity.


RESULTS
Functional analyses and gene set enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes or a custom pathway database identified the complement system and complement regulators as one of the top up-regulated pathways in FCHL [false discovery rate (FDR) < 1E-30]. Higher adipocyte complement expression in FCHL was confirmed in the appropriate confirmation group. Higher complement gene expression was associated with lower adipocyte insulin receptor substrate-1 expression as marker of adipocyte insulin resistance, independent of age, sex, or disease status, and this association was corroborated in the two confirmation groups. Additionally, complement gene expression was associated with triglycerides in the discovery set and with triglycerides and/or waist circumference in the confirmation groups. Complement pathway up-regulation did not appear to be driven by hypertriglyceridemia because a 40% pharmacological reduction in triglycerides did not affect complement expression.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings point to an up-regulation of a complement-related transcriptome in sc adipocytes under metabolically stressed conditions, even in the absence of overt obesity. Such up-regulation may subsequently influence downstream processes, including macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue and adipocyte insulin resistance.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""M. M.

2cef2b8c02b1b7b8cf39cb89977abc12119d1b6c,"Dissection of the module network implementation ""LemonTree"": enhancements towards applications in metagenomics and translation in autoimmune maladies.","Under the current deluge of omics, module networks distinctively emerge as methods capable of not only identifying inherently coherent groups (modules), thus reducing dimensionality, but also hypothesizing cause-effect relationships between modules and their regulators. Module networks were first designed in the transcriptomic era and further exploited in the multi-omic context to assess (for example) miRNA regulation of gene expression. Despite a number of available implementations, expansion of module networks to other omics is constrained by a limited characterization of the solutions' (modules plus regulators) accuracy and stability - an immediate need for the better characterization of molecular biology complexity in silico. We hence carefully assessed for LemonTree - a popular and open source module network implementation - the dependency of the software performances (sensitivity, specificity, false discovery rate, solutions' stability) on the input parameters and on the data quality (sample size, expression noise) based on synthetic and real data. In the process, we uncovered and fixed an issue in the code for the regulator assignment procedure. We concluded this evaluation with a table of recommended parameter settings. Finally, we applied these recommended settings to gut-intestinal metagenomic data from rheumatoid arthritis patients, to characterize the evolution of the gut-intestinal microbiome under different pharmaceutical regimens (methotrexate and prednisone) and we inferred innovative clinical recommendations with therapeutic potential, based on the computed module network.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Youtao Lu"", ids = ""2134223""); list(name = ""Xiaoyuan Zhou"", ids = ""48666959""); list(name = ""Christine Nardini"", ids = ""1691060"")",49cdac8bcdccb151c0048a5a13ff59fdfc97f739; 0ec3c54d4683e2e32ebd369d51b9c365f336ef5f; 551709ba1c053a8132832f4cdd9b905d30899af4,,Molecular bioSystems,13 10,"

e7299d58644a444cd23ec44dea0658586939b097,Transcriptomic effects of Tet-on and mifepristone-inducible systems in mouse liver.,"Control of transgene expression from long-term expression vectors can be achieved with inducible and regulated promoters. The two most commonly used inducible systems employ doxycycline or mifepristone as the drug activating a silent trans-activator, which is expressed from a constitutive promoter. We evaluated the alterations provoked by constitutive expression in the liver of rtTA2(S)-M2 (rtTA2; second-generation reverse tetracycline-controlled trans-activator) and GLp65, which are the trans-activators of the doxycyline- and mifepristone-inducible systems, respectively. To this end we performed transcriptomic analysis of mice expressing these trans-activators in the liver over 1 month. rtTA2 expression induced alterations in a few genes (69 gene probesets; false discovery rate [FDR], approximately 0.05), whereas GLp65 caused more numerous changes (1059 gene probe-sets, an FDR of approximately 0.05). However, only 20 and 53 of the genes from the rtTA2 and GLp65 groups, respectively, showed changes (R-fold >or= 3). Functional assignments indicate that alterations were mild and of little general significance. Few additional transcriptomic changes were observed when expressing trans-activators in the presence of inducer drugs; most were due to the drugs themselves. These results and the absence of toxicity observed in treated animals indicate that the two inducible systems are well tolerated and have little impact on the liver transcriptome profile. The milder alterations found with the use of rtTA2 suggest that this system is possibly safer for gene therapy applications.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mercedes Reboredo"", ids = ""143692160""); list(name = ""Maria Gabriela Kramer"", ids = ""49590332""); list(name = ""Cristian Smerdou"", ids = ""46844488""); list(name = ""JesÃºs Prieto"", ids = ""145236517""); list(name = ""Javier De Las Rivas"", ids = ""80335884"")",67271d5fc3690e199ab6b105adb0e9b07368f370; ce3a530a6e877a310379773da69f89b1ee56cbd1; 3f1d7a20dda212099084ab075af21a3fbf2a7728; 765f925fa7e70be4e5a28b13ea172dadf3f6ff9c; 38a5d3736c9fcec7af2c56526cc4d135c2604925; 15252d8a7555f3271be9e592257d8300c6810dff; eced8a85a3dcdcc78fe7b093b26881a32f17cbef; 57df60bb8b16aa5704cfd7cebedd325e57e35f34; 49bd5c1f017460a742f047445ec4adbf4e4481e1,b61401c14afa9f5daae6a97285616a6188ce1111; c82a68b5a31be4d64a07a27e2cbaca77cdce6cbf; eb7d1c2dc0069a0792a42964b844e9ca3123ef2d; 809e679597d96555948ddad17aff8ad7e2f79e6d; 52625d4bbf3cb1907327b81817762e1e33754075; 31e582aa598644f946d27492bd979f235d703ba8; 1e08a0b4d65f6b9b8a0c3e6c197f667e6a545791; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; c2756904cdabe1439e0bf91999669992977c9d72; 663eed65524d8af0ee29de500cf8b7a0a61e8756; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f18b42ff20acf234ca57b36ad9acc97b655ba3ea; 717a2b4138134beacc98d6bf22b6a62c3283d345; d0fbf6b9e3dd2d437745eeff60c775eb85bf532d; d5ae46c77f09984acc894ccd6b95272a613566c8; a07add012b2784628b61cd951b943001d1a1d907; 548b5b7cab014c1b8bba2f51c21d25fd032c4c80; be37243d52287cd571b3279c880ea056067192ef; 45b6086411e5c65ce8ac29d5c356d2b7ade0044d; 9cf44b3669cbf4176f8ef792293f1ef8ade5ca85; 40500a87642d640de59abb8efbe5466708404634; ccad6f8c9c7cd953aa42f2cdc8f83fadcd54abb8; 740fcc59a67a3984e4614452c2cf0abe9a151323; b61ef36c137eef1cc8e6fc26516430a79eedefa5; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; da48bd382d9fc48db0e3d56e2805377f8044e3b3; de21477fc9a18ee2072b24a47418dee18808da9e; f8584327a151af6dd487b9d52e6501e67e647fbd; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 66fc453fe06f1bd470f8effb7bf45ba408109b4e; c5926f44b41bb98b8aee35b95c3531ce8be0febf; c626c9cef6ddcf302767d96211a9cf62f432fa20; 77a113968b0e7d259a19daf66d364fc5de450acf; 0b05398c5e870bc1f8c76037cb13b4bc5d89ab1f; 0f86f0a0a8223018ef3886af226a1ee5185d1c0c; ac48fe5e1fce447f92b7330761f4c419a05fe906; 264b166328c6e62f561ca76d6cab159f85c245e2; 98a88f338a44b9f9fd6c374324ac2cc71142adff; 8e73e47c2e5791a9bfe4fdb2ebc0e54d679a9fcb; 98f0ec3fc118c230594810a881cbb0152ee26579; 98490ca915bc6d36c2f9e4804b8db694c0089716,Human gene therapy,19 11,"

a2e9c664e6ef34aa65d91b6e00b1330df37140e0,Characterization of the hepatic transcriptome following phenobarbital induction in mice with AIP.,"Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), an autosomal dominant hepatic disorder, results from hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) mutations that decrease the encoded enzymatic activity, thereby predisposing patients to life-threatening acute neurovisceral attacks. The ~1% penetrance of AIP suggests that other genetic factors modulate the onset and severity of the acute attacks. Here, we characterized the hepatic transcriptomic response to phenobarbital (PB) administration in AIP mice, which mimics the biochemical attacks of AIP. At baseline, the mRNA profiles of 14,138 hepatic genes prior to treatment were remarkably similar between AIP and the congenic wild-type (WT) mice. After PB treatment (~120â€¯mg/kg x 3d), 1347 and 1120 genes in AIP mice and 422 and 404 genes in WT mice were uniquely up- and down-regulated, respectively, at a False Discovery Rateâ€¯<â€¯0.05. As expected, the ALAS1 expression increased 4.5-fold and 15.9-fold in the WT and AIP mice, respectively. ALA-dehydrogenase also was induced ~1.7-fold in PB-induced AIP mice, but was unchanged in PB-induced WT mice. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall expression of 155 hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, although Cyp2c40, Cyp2c68, Cyp2c69, Mgst3 were upregulated only in PB-induced AIP mice (>1.9-fold) and Cyp21a1 was upregulated only in PB-induced WT mice (>9-fold). Notably, the genes differentially expressed in induced AIP mice were enriched in circadian rhythm, mitochondria biogenesis and electron transport, suggesting these pathways were involved in AIP mice responding to PB treatment. These results advance our understanding of the hepatic metabolic changes in PB-induced AIP mice and have implications in the pathogenesis of AIP acute attacks.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brenden Chen"", ids = ""14238595""); list(name = ""Minghui Wang"", ids = ""145244968""); list(name = ""Lin Gan"", ids = ""38512584""); list(name = ""Bin Zhang"", ids = ""37762208""); list(name = ""Robert J Desnick"", ids = ""3843565""); list(name = ""Makiko Yasuda"", ids = ""6981292"")",,,Molecular genetics and metabolism,,

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a world-widely prevalent disease with adverse outcomes. This study aims to identify its disease genes through bioinformatics analysis.


STUDY DESIGN
The raw gene expression profiling (ID: GSE19649) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 3 GDM and 2 healthy control specimens. Then limma package in R was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs, criteria: p value <0.05 and |log2 FC|>1). Simultaneously, known disease genes of GDM were downloaded from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. Then, DEGs and known disease genes were uploaded to STRING to investigate their protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Gene pairs with confidence score >0.8 were utilized to construct PPI network. Furthermore, pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed through KOBAS (criterion: p value <0.05) and DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) software (criterion: false discovery rate <0.05), respectively.


RESULTS
A total of 404 DEGs were identified, including 273 up-regulated and 131 down-regulated DEGs. Moreover, 68 known disease genes of GDM were obtained. Then, 190 gene pairs were identified to significantly interact with each other. After deleting PPIs between DEGs, PPI network was constructed, consisting of 115 gene pairs. Furthermore, genes in PPI network were significantly enriched in 10 functions and 8 pathways.


CONCLUSION
Based on PPI network and functional consistency, 6 candidate genes of GDM were considered to be candidate disease genes of GDM, including CYP1A1, LEPR, ESR1, GYS2, AGRP, and CACNA1G. However, further studies are required to validate these results.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qingying Zhang"", ids = ""2939137""); list(name = ""Mulan He"", ids = ""49109870""); list(name = ""Jue Wang"", ids = ""36541522""); list(name = ""Shuangping Liu"", ids = ""3242450""); list(name = ""Haidong Cheng"", ids = ""4630274""); list(name = ""Yan Cheng"", ids = ""145837690"")",3e69c9a6afee112163e027503e8e87a28d46dc74; 55e860703b47d8cc1a3695fafdcc602d68f50828; 748bf949f5e30ca1b16420d41d6c9ebe3e259440,,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",186,"

0d57aee0acb8c652857261a9554e6e453aaa0e56,RNA-seq differential gene expression analysis in mammary tissue from lactating dairy cows supplemented with sunflower oil,"Context Nutrition is the main environmental factor that regulates the composition and secretion of milk fat. For this reason, supplementation of ruminant feed with lipid sources is proposed as a strategy to improve the milk fatty acid profile. However, incorporation of these compounds in milk depends not only on the structure of the diet but also on the efficient capture of nutrients by the mammary tissue and the coordination in the expression and regulation of multiple genes. Aim To evaluate the effect of supplementation with sunflower oil, on gene expression in the mammary gland of Holstein cows under grazing and in the first third of lactation, by using RNA sequencing technology. Methods Six Holstein cows were divided into two groups: a control group, and a group supplemented with 700 g/day of sunflower oil (unsaturated fatty acid) for 25 days. On the last day, a sample of mammary tissue was taken for RNA-seq analysis. Raw data were analysed by using the CLC Genomics Workbench software. Key results Milk protein genes CSN1S1, CSN2, PAEP (LGB), CSN3, CSN1S2 and LALBA were the most abundant in all samples. In the supplemented group, 13 genes were differentially expressed with a false discovery rate <0.15 of which six were upregulated (PRSS2, BEST3, LOC618633, ASB5, NTS and C2CD4B) and seven downregulated (BOLA, DEFB, CLIC6, ATP6V1B1, DCHS2, EYA4 and CYP4B1). These were related to immune-response processes, cell differentiation and membrane transport. Conclusions Supplementation with sunflower oil affects metabolism and other cellular functions in mammary tissue, influencing the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism, and genes involved in cellâ€“cell interactions, cell morphology, cell death and immune response. Implications These results help to highlight the mechanisms underlying in vivo responses to dietary factors such as supplementation with seed oil in lactating cows. This will serve as a basis for the future development of strategies that improve the fatty acid profile of milk.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Sorany Milena Barrientos Grajales"", ids = ""1438843092""); list(name = ""JosÃ© JuliÃ¡n Echeverri Zuluaga"", ids = ""52100638""); list(name = ""Albeiro LÃ³pez Herrera"", ids = ""87461161""); list(name = ""NÃ©lida RodrÃ­guez Osorio"", ids = ""88500138""); list(name = ""Diana MarÃ­a BolÃ­var Vergara"", ids = ""80477728"")",,,Animal Production Science,60,758

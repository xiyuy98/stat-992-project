3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de,False discovery and false nondiscovery rates in single-step multiple testing procedures,"Results on the false discovery rate (FDR) and the false nondiscovery rate (FNR) are developed for single-step multiple testing procedures. In addition to verifying desirable properties of FDR and FNR as measures of error rates, these results extend previously known results, providing further insights, particularly under dependence, into the notions of FDR and FNR and related measures. First, considering fixed configurations of true and false null hypotheses, inequalities are obtained to explain how an FDR- or FNR-controlling single-step procedure, such as a Bonferroni or Sidak procedure, can potentially be improved. Two families of procedures are then constructed, one that modifies the FDR-controlling and the other that modifies the FNR-controlling Sidak procedure. These are proved to control FDR or FNR under independence less conservatively than the corresponding families that modify the FDR- or FNR-controlling Bonferroni procedure. Results of numerical investigations of the performance of the modified Sidak FDR procedure over its competitors are presented. Second, considering a mixture model where different configurations of true and false null hypotheses are assumed to have certain probabilities, results are also derived that extend some of Storey's work to the dependence case.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

1fbe89e093617a7d0b3c6fbde5c1596dd59ef9fd,A powerful procedure that controls the false discovery rate with directional information.,"In many multiple testing applications in genetics, the signs of the test statistics provide useful directional information, such as whether genes are potentially up- or down-regulated between two experimental conditions. However, most existing procedures that control the false discovery rate (FDR) are p-value based and ignore such directional information. We introduce a novel procedure, the signed-knockoff procedure, to utilize the directional information and control the FDR in finite samples. We demonstrate the power advantage of our procedure through simulation studies and two realÂ applications. This article is protected by copyright.

A detailed hypothesis of the mechanisms of stone disease etiology remains elusive and thus makes stone disease difficult to treat and to prevent. The present study assessed the feasibility of histologically sectioning human stones and using laser microdissection (LMD) to obtain samples for proteomic analysis. METHODS: Stones were imaged by micro-Computed Tomography, demineralized, embedded in paraffin, histologically sectioned and stained. Regions of the stone-matrix layers were dissected via LMD (Leica LMD 6) and collected in phosphate buffer. Extracted proteins were digested using Trypsin/Lysine C mix proteases and run in a Q Exactive Orbitrap High Field Liquid Chromatography (LC)/Mass Spectrometry (MS) system. Data were searched using MaxQuant (version 1.6.10.1) and filtered using False Discovery Rate for alpha=0.01. RESULTS: Histological sections of stones showed tightly packed layers of matrix that were clearly visible using bright field LMD microscopy (Figure 1A). Average area dissected by LMD for LC/MS was 1.64x106 Âµm2, and these revealed and yielded an average of 777 distinct proteins each. Initial analysis shows proteins to be similar to those previously reported for kidney stones, including proteins involved in cell injury and repair as well as important mediators of the immune system. CONCLUSIONS: Human kidney stones can be histologically sectioned and laser microdissected. A relatively small region of sectioned stone yields significant proteomic data. Utilization and optimizing of these novel methods and techniques in the future will pave the way into a deeper understanding of stone genesis. Future investigation of the stone matrix proteome should provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of urolithiasis in an effort to develop effective therapies and prevention treatments.

Special attention is devoted to experiments with rare false hypotheses. This sparsity assumption is typically for various genome studies when a portion of remarkable genes should be detected. The aim is to derive tests which control the false discovery rate (FDR) always at finite sample size. The procedures are compared for the set up of dependent and independent $p$-values. It turns out that the FDR bounds differ by a dependency factor which can be used as a correction quantity. We offer sparsity modifications and improved dependence tests which generalize the Benjamini-Yekutieli test and adaptive tests in the sense of Storey. As a byproduct, an early stopped test is presented in order to bound the number of rejections. The new procedures perform well for real genome data examples.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marc Ditzhaus"", ids = ""90676908""); list(name = ""Arnold Janssen"", ids = ""47562227"")",,d4fe3369c896dcd3c93f46783c1ad385b8097500; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; c0638f4b4f3601868a22939d7698887f56a4d813; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 4f906bfe6b28535b1d5bac2ac525bfabcf2d9369; 1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; 85b3043be9fa0b7afe0e72694a23df8dfcbcb0a1; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 48bc9123c1b64b5d2657158feee63d094039083f; 8b097b03c9e381fb77a13727380593a853f0a8f0; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; fd53b612a65a601ad1af356e8de28eb9a7e95c42; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; cb9f6f5fae553d372dbcefecb2535b8caca9d0c5; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; d3ab54e250ef51a3c9b6146cd26229275c76d15b; 0c14d9af7e1ca8bc1967ad3ffe92ffd6759f28a4; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; e4ab1fbeeaebfc457fb16cd366cf4745feae5a9a; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78; 8becaa4ddafe17458e0dd94fbd75d32a47d84d27; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
9f859afeaa8f3d62345217e102c965613b69edd4,Multiple-testing strategy for analyzing cDNA array data on gene expression.,"An objective of many functional genomics studies is to estimate treatment-induced changes in gene expression. cDNA arrays interrogate each tissue sample for the levels of mRNA for hundreds to tens of thousands of genes, and the use of this technology leads to a multitude of treatment contrasts. By-gene hypotheses tests evaluate the evidence supporting no effect, but selecting a significance level requires dealing with the multitude of comparisons. The p-values from these tests order the genes such that a p-value cutoff divides the genes into two sets. Ideally one set would contain the affected genes and the other would contain the unaffected genes. However, the set of genes selected as affected will have false positives, i.e., genes that are not affected by treatment. Likewise, the other set of genes, selected as unaffected, will contain false negatives, i.e., genes that are affected. A plot of the observed p-values (1 - p) versus their expectation under a uniform [0, 1] distribution allows one to estimate the number of true null hypotheses. With this estimate, the false positive rates and false negative rates associated with any p-value cutoff can be estimated. When computed for a range of cutoffs, these rates summarize the ability of the study to resolve effects. In our work, we are more interested in selecting most of the affected genes rather than protecting against a few false positives. An optimum cutoff, i.e., the best set given the data, depends upon the relative cost of falsely classifying a gene as affected versus the cost of falsely classifying a gene as unaffected. We select the cutoff by a decision-theoretic method analogous to methods developed for receiver operating characteristic curves. In addition, we estimate the false discovery rate and the false nondiscovery rate associated with any cutoff value.

674555302c07356dd3d63787fbe3310205cf090e,Nonlinear fitting method for determining local false discovery rates from decoy database searches.,"False discovery rate (FDR) analyses of protein and peptide identification results using decoy database searching conventionally report aggregate or global FDRs for a whole set of identifications, which are often not very informative about the error rates of individual members in the set. We describe a nonlinear curve fitting method for calculating the local FDR, which estimates the chance that an individual protein (or peptide) is incorrect, and present a simple tool that implements this analysis. The goal of this method is to offer a simple extension to the now commonplace decoy database searching, providing additional valuable information.",2008,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wilfred H.

CpG island DNA hypermethylation and global DNA hypomethylation are hallmark characteristics of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we aim to explore the effect of genetic variations within the genes that regulate the DNA methylation and demethylation pathways on outcomes in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) treated with first-line therapy and enrolled in three independent, randomised, open-label clinical trials.


METHODS
A total of 884 patients with mCRC enrolled in TRIBE, MAVERICC and FIRE-3 trials were included. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes involved in DNA methylation and demethylation pathways were analysed. The prognostic value of each SNP across all treatment arms was quantified using the inverse-variance-weighted effect size, a meta-analysis approach implemented in the METASOFT software.


RESULTS
In the meta-analysis, DNMT3A rs11681717 was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratioÂ =Â 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.46; PÂ =Â 0.002; false discovery rate [FDR]Â =Â 0.016), accounting for seven tests in the DNA methylation pathway. In addition, there was suggestive evidence of association for ten-eleven translocation (TET) genes variance with tumour response (TET1 rs3814177, odds ratio [OR]Â =Â 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97, PÂ =Â 0.025, FDRÂ =Â 0.087; TET3 rs7560668, ORÂ =Â 1.44; 95% CI 1.10-1.89; PÂ =Â 0.009; FDRÂ =Â 0.062).


CONCLUSIONS
We showed that polymorphisms within the genes responsible for the DNA methylation and demethylation machineries are correlated with outcomes in patients with mCRC who were enrolled in three independent, randomised, open-label, phase II/III clinical trials. In addition, we demonstrated the feasibility of a meta-analysis approach to identify stronger and more convincing association between gene polymorphisms and outcome, potentially leading the way to a new method of analysis for similar data set.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alberto Puccini"", ids = ""40120412""); list(name = ""Fotios Loupakis"", ids = ""3759655""); list(name = ""Sebastian Stintzing"", ids = ""3743380""); list(name = ""Shu Cao"", ids = ""50979849""); list(name = ""Francesca Battaglin"", ids = ""12676537""); list(name = ""Ryuma Togunaka"", ids = ""80830410""); list(name = ""Madiha Naseem"", ids = ""29888871""); list(name = ""Martin D.

5edc9e14b11be2a30b4f4b33fe06ea88e9baefb7,Discrimination of Dysplastic Nevi from Common Melanocytic Nevi by Cellular andÂ Molecular Criteria.,"Dysplastic nevi (DNs), also known as Clark's nevi or atypical moles, are distinguished from common melanocytic nevi by variegation in pigmentation and clinical appearance, as well as differences in tissue patterning. However, cellular and molecular differences between DNs and common melanocytic nevi are not completely understood. Using cDNA microarray, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry, we molecularly characterized DNs and analyzed the difference between DNs and common melanocytic nevi. A total of 111 probesets (91 annotated genes, fold change > 2.0 and false discovery rate < 0.25) were differentially expressed between the two lesions. An unexpected finding in DNs was altered differentiation and activation of epidermal keratinocytes with increased expression of hair follicle-related molecules (keratin 25, trichohyalin, ribonuclease, RNase A family, 7) and inflammation-related molecules (S100A7, S100A8) at both genomic and protein levels. The immune microenvironment of DNs was characterized by an increase of T helper type 1 (IFNÎ³) and T helper type 2 (IL13) cytokines as well as an upregulation of oncostatin M and CXCL1. DUSP3, which regulates cellular senescence, was identified as one of the disease discriminative genes between DNs and common melanocytic nevi by three independent statistical approaches and its altered expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The molecular and cellular changes in which the epidermal-melanin unit undergoes follicular differentiation as well as upregulation of defined cytokines could drive complex immune, epidermal, and pigmentary alterations.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hiroshi Mitsui"", ids = ""48034658""); list(name = ""Felix Kiecker"", ids = ""46339276""); list(name = ""Avner Shemer"", ids = ""10392301""); list(name = ""Maria Vittoria Cannizzaro"", ids = ""40441927""); list(name = ""Claire Q.

69cabe2f45341a247b94f53aeec6eacfa451b97d,Quantitative Assessment of Hit Detection and Confirmation in Single and Duplicate High-Throughput Screenings,"The process of identifying active targets (hits) in high-throughput screening (HTS) usually involves 2 steps: first, removing or adjusting for systematic variation in the measurement process so that extreme values represent strong biological activity instead of systematic biases such as plate effect or edge effect and, second, choosing a meaningful cutoff on the calculated statistic to declare positive compounds. Both false-positive and false-negative errors are inevitable in this process. Common control or estimation of error rates is often based on an assumption of normal distribution of the noise. The error rates in hit detection, especially false-negative rates, are hard to verify because in most assays, only compounds selected in primary screening are followed up in confirmation experiments. In this article, the authors take advantage of a quantitative HTS experiment in which all compounds are tested 42 times over a wide range of 14 concentrations so true positives can be found through a dose-response curve. Using the activity status defined by dose curve, the authors analyzed the effect of various data-processing procedures on the sensitivity and specificity of hit detection, the control of error rate, and hit confirmation. A new summary score is proposed and demonstrated to perform well in hit detection and useful in confirmation rate estimation. In general, adjusting for positional effects is beneficial, but a robust test can prevent overadjustment. Error rates estimated based on normal assumption do not agree with actual error rates, for the tails of noise distribution deviate from normal distribution. However, false discovery rate based on empirically estimated null distribution is very close to observed false discovery proportion.

The wavelet transform of a spatial map of brain activation statistics can be tested in two stages to achieve this objective: First, a set of possible wavelet coefficients to test is reduced, and second, each hypothesis in the remaining subset is formally tested. We show that a Bayesian bivariate shrinkage operator (BaybiShrink) for the first step provides a powerful and expedient alternative to a subband adaptive chi-squared test or an enhanced FDR algorithm based on the generalized degrees of freedom. We also investigate the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (CWT) as an alternative basis to the orthogonal discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We design and validate a test for activation based on the magnitude of the complex wavelet coefficients and show that this confers improved specificity for mapping spatial signals. The methods are applied to simulated and experimental data, including a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. We conclude that using BaybiShrink to define a reduced set of complex wavelet coefficients, and testing the magnitude of each complex pair to control the FDR, represents a competitive solution for multiple hypothesis mapping in fMRI.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Levent Sendur"", ids = ""1919610""); list(name = ""Vladislav Maxim"", ids = ""145120163""); list(name = ""Brandon Whitcher"", ids = ""2275891""); list(name = ""Edward T.

7d78a3b810480b491c748322a354fb5bfdd9a1ff,Resistance Exercise Reverses Aging in Human Skeletal,"Human aging is associated with skeletal muscle atrophy and functional impairment (sarcopenia). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to sarcopenia. We evaluated whether healthy aging was associated with a transcriptional profile reflecting mitochondrial impairment and whether resistance exercise could reverse this signature to that approximating a younger physiological age. Skeletal muscle biopsies from healthy older (N=25) and younger (N=26) adult men and women were compared using gene expression profiling, and a subset of these were related to measurements of muscle strength. 14 of the older adults had muscle samples taken before and after a six-month resistance exercise-training program. Before exercise training, older adults were 59% weaker than younger, but after six months of training in older adults, strength improved significantly (P,0.001) such that they were only 38% lower than young adults. As a consequence of age, we found 596 genes differentially expressed using a false discovery rate cut-off of 5%. Prior to the exercise training, the transcriptome profile showed a dramatic enrichment of genes associated with mitochondrial function with age. However, following exercise training the transcriptional signature of aging was markedly reversed back to that of younger levels for most genes that were affected by both age and exercise. We conclude that healthy older adults show evidence of mitochondrial impairment and muscle weakness, but that this can be partially reversed at the phenotypic level, and substantially reversed at the transcriptome level, following six months of resistance exercise training.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Muscle Melov"", ids = ""90356585""); list(name = ""Mark A Tarnopolsky"", ids = ""144792938""); list(name = ""Kenneth B Beckman"", ids = ""145641850""); list(name = ""Krysta Felkey"", ids = ""6268515""); list(name = ""Alan Hubbard"", ids = ""46897380"")",878c7a5dc43d8f167c9dba5291962677bdf9e376; d27b57b7f5e79bb5deb705d79f9f597c8a4931fc; 59d12ab37c8b67c64a6ee074ca2149f77d92694b,,,,
86377a795559a46e6cab2b28caaec152f9b76add,Novel Loci Associated With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Are Revealed by Leveraging Polygenic Overlap With Educational Attainment.,"OBJECTIVE
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and highly heritable psychiatric condition. By exploiting the reported relationship between ADHD and educational attainment (EA), we aimed to improve discovery of ADHD-associated genetic variants and to investigate genetic overlap between these phenotypes.


METHOD
A conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (condFDR/conjFDR) method was applied to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on ADHD (2,064 trios, 896 cases, and 2,455 controls) and EA (n=328,917) to identify ADHD-associated loci and loci overlapping between ADHD and EA. Identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association in an independent population-based study of ADHD symptoms (n=17,666). Genetic correlation between ADHD and EA was estimated using LD score regression and Pearson correlation.


RESULTS
At levels of condFDR<0.01 and conjFDR<0.05, we identified 5 ADHD-associated loci, 3 of these being shared between ADHD and EA. None of these loci had been identified in the primary ADHD GWAS, demonstrating the increased power provided by the condFDR/conjFDR analysis. Leading SNPs for 4 of 5 identified regions are in introns of protein coding genes (KDM4A, MEF2C, PINK1, RUNX1T1), whereas the remaining one is an intergenic SNP on chromosome 2 at 2p24. Consistent direction of effects in the independent study of ADHD symptoms was shown for 4 of 5 identified loci. A polygenic overlap between ADHD and EA was supported by significant genetic correlation (rg=-0.403, p=7.90Ã—10-8) and >10-fold mutual enrichment of SNPs associated with both traits.


CONCLUSION
We identified 5 novel loci associated with ADHD and provided evidence for a shared genetic basis between ADHD and EA.

105fd67cc25ae950a5cad71c9f15b7417344b089,Influence of outliers on QTL mapping for complex traits,"A method was proposed for the detection of outliers and influential observations in the framework of a mixed linear model, prior to the quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analysis. We investigated the impact of outliers on QTL mapping for complex traits in a mouse BXD population, and observed that the dropping of outliers could provide the evidence of additional QTL and epistatic loci affecting the 1stBrain-OB and the 2ndBrain-OB in a cross of the abovementioned population. The results could also reveal a remarkable increase in estimating heritabilities of QTL in the absence of outliers. In addition, simulations were conducted to investigate the detection powers and false discovery rates (FDRs) of QTLs in the presence and absence of outliers. The results suggested that the presence of a small proportion of outliers could increase the FDR and hence decrease the detection power of QTLs. A drastic increase could be obtained in the estimates of standard errors for position, additive and additiveÃ—environment interaction effects of QTLs in the presence of outliers.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yousaf Hayat"", ids = ""6581377""); list(name = ""Jian Yang"", ids = ""40243319""); list(name = ""Hai-Ming Xu"", ids = ""40131794""); list(name = ""Jun Zhu"", ids = ""47055094"")",6793abbea279d71eaf794fe02c813b50c25d0122; 74d251c2f679603a3cd200d829983230b9e2c0f9; d259b9f309cbd1069f4b5519f94b05748137f6d2; f839046cdd0a67ec81f26d84a08c86c1ace493ab; 72d5f0cb7032be5cfe4d4c81e43c5a33999a4f32,b71d92fd86a4c20038b7420a36fb80e0008ca4de; daacf61f1fc5536d7dc11b1dfe08bae1bfaa6d37; 3f332494ee5873057aca59e77671c4b53dd695b5; 366f01d579f1529c15beff2c044b7aa7e3792774; 1a530d81b68a01b6452fa50e38c8f2187db1cb0c; ca63333d4a67823f8cadec7127358e3b5f13bb9d; ec1597f14c59aff7b4294736698289db5f018849; aa103274c9669f8e04924720faabb38b68b8a650; c7a8bbcc6cc7c50d2edb48db5ae4b336ecaa892f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 09d15098d4a3f8672a5a31a87b7019ff067d040c; 294dfa22a3f0d1569f6973d7d2f6c98dcf8b6e74; 695178cd0e8ff93cabfce03aaad32a591071f3a3; 4f8da08e678800a5b682928b64a42f7d60600fc1; 96be493d2d823b6531579f2bb48ea766db0f5897; fec121c65654f13109f1826d2dfbf14222e10805; 1c676a14188eb2b94de15f3c2c9490560890dc8d; 8329d2b97eddbe861137a9bb4466637fc2ad8ce5; 702773e40133afd0f967edd333f36f51ace23f6c; d55af19ae36dc21481b958745ca44a1758c269fa,Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B,9,931-937
18fec084ff9b91a387528437a6f2ea92a31ed0df,Spectral Library Search Improves Assignment of TMT Labeled MS/MS Spectra.,"Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a proven approach for large-scale multiplexed protein quantification. However, the identification of TMT-labeled peptides is compromised by the labeling during traditional sequence database searches. In this study, we aim to use a spectral library search to increase the sensitivity and specificity of peptide identification for TMT-based MS data. Compared to MS/MS spectra of unlabeled peptides, the spectra of TMT-labeled counterparts usually display intensified b ions, suggesting that TMT labeling can alter product ion patterns during MS/MS fragementation. We compiled a human TMT spectral library of 401,168 unique peptides of high quality from millions of peptide-spectrum matches in tens of profiling projects, matching to 14,048 nonredundant proteins (13,953 genes). A mouse TMT spectral library of similar size was also constructed. The libraries were subsequently appended with decoy spectra to evaluate the false discovery rate, which was validated by a simulated null TMT data set. The performance of the library search was further optimized by removing TMT reporter ions and selecting an appropriate library construction method. Finally, we searched a human TMT data set against the spectral library to demonstrate that the spectral library outperformed the sequence database. Both human and mouse TMT libraries were made publicly available to the research community.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianqiao Shen"", ids = ""2701690""); list(name = ""Vishwajeeth R Pagala"", ids = ""4322526""); list(name = ""Alex Breuer"", ids = ""3363977""); list(name = ""Junmin Peng"", ids = ""39692048""); list(name = ""Bin Ma"", ids = ""113248702""); list(name = ""Xusheng Wang"", ids = ""144621744"")",490f0e755b9cf5792e61b18212a3b15824d35ffa; 2d04122a9daecc50f5a92e7dc9460198974d0d17,,Journal of proteome research,17 9,"

ccb39e30987014ddc5c46dcc6b0f6896248b9bb3,Abnormal functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex is associated with depressive symptoms in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"BACKGROUND
Depressive symptoms are significant and very common psychiatric complications in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can aggravate the decline in social function. However, changes in the functional connectivity (FC) of the brain in AD patients with depressive symptoms (D-AD) remain unclear.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether any differences exist in the FC of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) between D-AD patients and non-depressed AD patients (nD-AD).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We recruited 15 D-AD patients and 17 age-, sex-, educational level-, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)-matched nD-AD patients to undergo tests using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and 3.0T resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Bilateral PCC were selected as the regions of interest and between-group differences in the PCC FC network were assessed using Student's t-test.


RESULTS
Compared with the nD-AD group, D-AD patients showed increased PCC FC in the right amygdala, right parahippocampus, right superior temporal pole, right middle temporal lobe, right middle temporal pole, and right hippocampus (AlphaSim correction; P<0.05). In the nD-AD group, MMSE scores were positively correlated with PCC FC in the right superior temporal pole and right hippocampus (false discovery rate corrected; P<0.05).


CONCLUSION
Differences were detected in PCC FC between nD-AD and D-AD patients, which may be related to depressive symptoms. Our study provides a significant enhancement to our understanding of the functional mechanisms underlying D-AD.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiangtao Zhang"", ids = ""47539186""); list(name = ""Zhongwei Guo"", ids = ""2683333""); list(name = ""Xiaozheng Liu"", ids = ""2945613""); list(name = ""Xize Jia"", ids = ""4983186""); list(name = ""Jianâ\200\220ping Li"", ids = ""47786978""); list(name = ""Yaoyao Li"", ids = ""47002614""); list(name = ""Danmei Lv"", ids = ""26895340""); list(name = ""Wei Chen"", ids = ""37420013"")",d88ed55d020494a26dde5491ca86d5c91b6ff403; 8c64d3c16c389dcb3ca28c7018bdc46a768e297a; 563f154defc05f5e0b1bff9b2088294f5c9ca695; 0ffd11cf772e6ded25b4b36caae98ffbac4a0b65; ecba87a7410bf6d299cd1c79f2c75d3cc1252ea0; 5cf7f6a745b70eec4e35871c5273cd2b7dfbda2c,8020a2f3f619d2e9dd79eceb6bff2c7304f95c03; eb519f6dac28b15f6dfd5504687a7d79382890a3; 6bfd30a483a4073623c901943128aa5bdf5e5dcd; b53712da3f27fd60407bee652706e0add8893b5b; 7bfb157d9060d580cb2e1173a3f4ac6563f0a532; a89c209a7e81394b538e607a113d506efcc2b15d; 37d2d04f8c09da1f0cf8434a38a51841b5b703bf; d9a7401cd95fbb09052a560505a5baa8e3a57287; c8832a5f4869b9ab5cee7d1535002d8ff7fe8856; 33154d9bec19c8bc909fa76dd9297e768460d5bc; 516cf0b10e70e01697cf7a503c94e0eb8343ced7; f201758b2df3af1225c3449dbe318ba8b82ef9fa; 2c1494118b8959f6f8aee21351a573e7e48e2c2b; e51c2bf690bd98833e430068f85449f0670f6399; 6d9714d6765b0a40e63d03320c18305cf946b691; e998671ea565ffabe65824aa90192efa5534bdd0; 2b17452f6a3f4091902d181399299538b299bf14; e430c98ac5377709348c38faaf93e33f673b2bcd; ac44ba9c52d73458b470a3f0a39e726377f7449e; 5b580e65cb0e83151eec3492d7c318a7923a1498; 0f136aa856bfc0e8c97f3b80cc93b38410b23d7b; 604a500b551126f374fd3b11dba56abb23909d2b; 16a0646bc9607b5b00fadeb8f2d0a29b0d2304d4; 1f79c2edb1da5d3d475ca10345f6043f6e9d4f7a; 9d620ada4eec7c2732dc3b390cc95adc3d39387c; eb09dd65221577a0aac0c5fe4539a26878fe64fc; 7e2ca96bf9477eb02d4f48e87e3835838162ab59; 319e1e13b7dce5570ff58cdddc1fedf2de68c86c; aa53e2bbd775eb04b00005db3b02c488d7a587da; f50e77af06b17beda32761eb8963fdba9f3c52b6; 1a76c8860059433211c6a4d9ad5cd5aacfc355df; 86b17ce2634a4a08daad9de623e3e96342745efa; 89500dbd76644b5096d4c85cc5aa0abaa89f6f7a; bdc5abbdfc268feb88d3fa97b68ac1ad4c566466; 95ffad22d1eed489463fb4ac2c5b6aaf241005b3; 9dfa1c49dde9ecaf93a9ca1abaec7be9a80f07c4; aa9ff102080422285a57f184d6591a3bd6a964d9; 5c1d8eafa1b92e7c6f94febe69f35a1671c08347; ea4857763cf82df49d19c40d70c2692833bc51e8; 677db67e798095fd0f4b1056ad3971d9cab99f6c; bcb45159d99bd2c8622117cdce93bf06e6a87782; 6a91a96e4b928c401f04c8ab36a1c0c0381f5b38; 7dfe19ce614b6990636c997c481734b6642d2007; 26c1f93708ec52d891af7ad7d8b5ee11c2256746; 0b39f2388ccf6a0b172f7a2eca349c97e6a58a31; ff244653bd69edf7a38c4e0ecc80270d5d723b25; 116d80052fbc9e5740aa04373ec6df0073a26652; 84cbf5e42744a14f5d2988c0cbb12b23778258ca; 008718f41e81608f9389a6b2b5978189782bd209; cd36c2f1a7ade34fcb5e7dfbda6103e345305fe2; ec724394404eaac1c7eafcc380c3c90a9bbcb41e; 5df5ddb7969cb45cccda578e2551bff3a989e38e; 611fc93cf24ec904d9345180aadbbae5539214fd; a2f2e0a43be73f3566b0276f4b40d17200b2d745; 8ae7373ec40e6befa8c2a88dad8b6e695e64dffd; 886fecd8ef10511de448282c09d5e8c75dffb749; 8c408c13a11418a5a669b0146bc6898680e765f0; 6c64889a707a15702f0abb047be5cd14d8a3dfb4; d1f0c3ea9541f2da45fc559228ba7eb69c8c245e; 6e62526fba615f7e3d0f49711a41fd6047be4b5f; 78375757672318474cc5a47dc98e585423723d41; f3d3a1d94f8fc4571fc6d9a39740d762b2079980; 1371145b3fcf0ec22135e301b52b716b00594b64; fe8387ba7e018ad42d40eebc5aac6f1d974ac3a8; 91cab878329812b31ae5ae61f7c6dbd8a237d149; 970ba638c6508f1674df5cf3b73a6ea598a5d8e8; fb5008b644cc40a6752dbde0645f9ab34167cd2c; 2a59a997ba2640ac5f75f7e209f6d0bde0897058; d67dc6d1be10878889e9d3c0e4b5cd04c1f27cc5; ffa70758f1f26a7709f1a496772cd679c1b0d5d3; 1d3d74ca325bfffeb0c77d97f5f3b617f5d9e335; a490aa8b1c0ef2e51759ca9352ca564418f7e8ec; 23cb103e7a4566ec4694761e278199a7a4f290a1; 4bb7fe4e2f87c83226bf966eb6e13079efddae2b; 0570ff70c04664c88a57598ec811264570912e2e; 137743ee8d930661ede1f297d9dc5b593b0d580c; 2a89e59ffc56ead5d047c68006ac865d0d5896e0; eb447f60b63391b605ce831c0840737510393d38; 93bc678116f0a062de7f694e0552f56df924d08f; e20f918ff9f19da9aad8c1f17f085b32aa2c1da5; 0c30868380c00f3ca42b82dd4d5e7e0bda9f5c90; 5cfdd5b0b2c624a28d9c5c232ff08f8b58a0f06d; 60dca4158e9afc362cb82446bd796417f8c06117; d1d545ef78bc28e6c782cd5c35829bc53c4c4bb9; 5f3eaff530f9b1a94e61ce5631652aafb2cfdc48; 6e714a55238e73e30bb614086ef2732d4b1ab1c0; 693a6e46be9b613ac5beab7313e1f0b51658dbe9; 9c2d2fc3e41b97e3b7154239bdf8b96d20682dd7; f2fdf7a9549536212d4e8ede7cdabf92a47116a2; c6646484cf19abd9eeed321ce5abc9574ff8ae11; b8b05e290dbb3232bd5aa07ee87500444d903995; 00df581b85ba60a4ccf5d2d899e13bfb1b4e685c; 03a57f27f5f3c5aa36bac50f2c5d03bc3bc36716; 3f6c2dbfbd1de9eaebe04eb38ad0e43c64822333; 85a787c9e609726776e5672bc00b48549f775055,Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,13,2589 - 2598
c8ece18926172a240c75b270be05485fefb58d10,Shotgun strategy-based proteome profiling analysis on the head of silkworm Bombyx mori,"Insect head is comprised of important sensory systems to communicate with internal and external environment and endocrine organs such as brain and corpus allatum to regulate insect growth and development. To comprehensively understand how all these components act and interact within the head, it is necessary to investigate their molecular basis at protein level. Here, the spectra of peptides digested from silkworm larval heads were obtained from liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCâ€“MS/MS) and were analyzed by bioinformatics methods. Totally, 539 proteins with a low false discovery rate (FDR) were identified by searching against an in-house database with SEQUEST and X!Tandem algorithms followed by trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP) validation. Forty-three proteins had the theoretical isoelectric point (pI) greater than 10 which were too difficult to separate by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Four chemosensory proteins, one odorant-binding protein, two diapause-related proteins, and a lot of cuticle proteins, interestingly including pupal cuticle proteins were identified.

Pathway analysis revealed that many proteins were highly homologous with the human proteins which involved in human neurodegenerative disease pathways, probably implying a symptom of the forthcoming metamorphosis of silkworm.

ad2fae3f096572e1ccc52f70162b8eb151c09c24,Global variation in renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal disease.,"BACKGROUND
Incidence rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease vary considerably worldwide. This study examines the independent association between the general population, health care system and renal service characteristics and RRT incidence rates.


METHODS
RRT incidence data (2003-2005) were obtained from renal registries; general population age and health and macroeconomic indices were collected from secondary sources. Renal service organization and resource data were obtained through interviews and questionnaires. Linear regression models were built to establish the factors independently associated with RRT incidence, stratified by the Human Development Index where required. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was adjusted for multiple testing.


RESULTS
Across the 46 countries (population 1.25 billion), RRT incidence rates ranged from 12 to 455 (median 130) per million population. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.02 per $1000 increase, P(FDR) = 0.047], percentage of GDP spent on health care (IRR: 1.11 per % increase, P(FDR) = 0.006) and dialysis facility reimbursement rate relative to GDP (IRR: 0.76 per GDP per capita-sized increase in reimbursement rate, P(FDR) = 0.007) were independently associated with RRT incidence. In more developed countries, the private for-profit share of haemodialysis facilities was also associated with higher incidence (IRR: 1.009 per % increase, P(FDR) = 0.003).


CONCLUSIONS
Macroeconomic and renal service factors are more often associated with RRT incidence rates than measured demographic or general population health status factors.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fergus J.

Of the twenty-four polymorphic loci tested, eighteen were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after a modified false discovery rate (B-Y FDR) correction, whereas six showed statistically significant deviations (CHS2 and CHS11: P<0.014 790; FCS1, FCS6, FCS8 and FCS14: P<0.015 377). Furthermore, four species of plesiomorphous and related sea cucumbers (Holothurian scabra, Holothuria leucospilota, Stichopus horrens and Apostichopus japonicas) were tested for mutual cross-amplification using a total of ninety microsatellite loci. Although transferability and universality of all loci were generally low, the results of the cross-species study showed that the markers can be applied to identify individuals to species according to the presence or absence of specific microsatellite alleles.

Contributions of environmental factors such as oxidative stress on complex traits and disease may be partly mediated through changes in epigenetic marks (e.g. DNA methylation). Studies relating differential methylation with intermediate phenotypes and disease endpoints may be useful in identifying additional candidate genes and mechanisms involved in disease.MethodsTo investigate the role of epigenetic variation in oxidative stress marker levels and subsequent development of CVD and T2D, we performed analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation in blood, ten markers of oxidative stress (total glutathione [TGSH], reduced glutathione [GSH], oxidised glutathione [GSSG], GSSG to GSH ratio, homocysteine [HCY], oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), antibodies against oxLDL [OLAB], conjugated dienes [CD], baseline conjugated dienes [BCD]-LDL and total antioxidant capacity [TAOC]) and incident disease in up to 966 age-matched individuals.ResultsIn total, we found 66 cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites associated with one or more oxidative stress markers (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). These sites were enriched in regulatory regions of the genome. Genes annotated to CpG sites showed enrichment in annotation clusters relating to phospho-metabolism and proteins with pleckstrin domains. We investigated the contribution of oxidative stress-associated CpGs to development of cardiometabolic disease. Methylation variation at CpGs in the 3'-UTR of HIST1H4D (cg08170869; histone cluster 1, H4d) and in the body of DVL1 (cg03465880; dishevelled-1) were associated with incident T2D events during 10Â years of follow-up (all permutation p-values <0.01), indicating a role of epigenetic regulation in oxidative stress processes leading to development or progression of diabetes. Methylation QTL (meQTL) analysis showed significant associations with genetic sequence variants in cis at 28 (42%) of oxidative stress phenotype-associated sites (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Integrating cis-meQTLs with genotype-phenotype associations indicated that genetic effects on oxidative stress phenotype at one locus (cg07547695; BCL2L11) may be mediated through DNA methylation.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we report novel associations of DNA methylation with oxidative stress, some of which also show evidence of a relation with T2D incidence.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ã…sa K Hedman"", ids = ""4349954""); list(name = ""Mihkel Zilmer"", ids = ""4043442""); list(name = ""Johan SundstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""144023638""); list(name = ""Lars Lind"", ids = ""2813823""); list(name = ""Erik Ingelsson"", ids = ""2105755"")",33e2a910213d6d677ee438573c3d50a9ff8330b4; 014cea3be54ef7ae649b6d1ef4acc4c3af171e8f; 84b008ede7208cceb2a70eaf130da0e7ae0d69f8; 6a11a289fa25d88de3cc48de8d68a22f7b9bdc3e; dbd35cae5ea34a290a5a2631b904212c0b060bb0; a273d59c3af21cd0d750c0c4902b7cd016f7f749; 13d22030d06664cd7f5856871df33e7235d64f0e; cbec6add0b0b2a8599f0055b25aadf02362e2600; 821046390f0297b949d4606ad2b8cf5f9259f724; 7e92126cc9e804927b950c1a2b53508a78b43fdf; 2523cc3a3e5f98adc7ec4c9c55d563716a93e142; 890ed62d21b1eca9e1c0c974dade74eb069930fa; 2f1056d617e516836ed8c598cbe1a415e322624e; 98a1ad786175fd0971c0f59e58c2336ddc0e76c5; 8e8bd3e66d3c5222c31e191a84ee1316387e8a84,49efa0bd104c853a51c51b766e7b4958c66fa058; 31eaa359d1f75370329a41c1dfb13e584d02a236; e983d2bf6ff6bc9a27c3f0162d61951a09f5023c; 57a13cb60092dbdb23fd497fc70fffb4299c46b1; 44391362cc0ac5db49f94263138e1dda580a5e72; dee7381cb0b53f27b6b402e82dec9e1a2eaa7850; 1467a4368f41aaa43fc65b4182e48d9588ed17eb; 434022884c7261c5ed271ff43c2daf7d077e48fc; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; a8fb8f9ae315e8fa663cd8a14bfc3083b71ed306; 5b6216784361cb713d144913bd396da342b5ab6d; 5cfeb8d12ca8500447f60f90474052685fa0a63f; 76ada33eae0abcb5512fe0fa37a5d67c639fce67; 6b1cb8eac64fa4deba316ec6b21d31f37aa2444b; 6b68ae5e0bfdee0d59dd729783a70e3398cdbbcd; faf3bfa50336eb6644bebe95a351b6a83dd2355d; 4e09546d75fe43e0a0a599d760fc954c76f93e3b; 1d7c3476d0e67a78f3378e3f83db03f892d8c21c; 580adbebecb4d2cbd90197a67c4037f1944efae3; 9d4f1fa93a23b7608adc51ed2c878603489f0940; 7fbf9e4a8919128263b6e4ed3d97a652c53766d8; 7182c582b3b8fa330219bb6c6c82a83538a1fff5; de30519eadcb082c58a10a8767037e88c3863e46; ba1f227d7f2cb6c6d722ab31cc2e80ab569ef586; 71e242967e747b7f167b20fba2bd9a39134e00fe; 27f825d28a8bf48dcfe51b294e4d61d9c58d1192; f1b152ac695e7adfef7903ea8a19a793cc17803a; f0e420b57065da2d189288925ec044323bafa26a; 2bbd98012f6aee6dcd6fcdb00375334a33d1bc87; b9b7a3225a1da33d3924ade2bd2ffa8dc4d2f218; 4c8fc15267015bf81bc2ce9fb41a1a831498eac1; b8dbb38177c419ca676dc44b8e32e6b914d025a8; 015688f49a26ca19bd67d2299bd16ad0816331cf; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 25578b5248b74cb6170b6433a90f165f6f0b3561; e1624cfc69296ec928e9c320a782950aa038b4a5; e6e46cbd0c1d78b9be3d1b69a6a18da4ef3360a9; ac3d7c88cd1aa2e4fde28f5fbff55664c70145b6; c1ec10e877f9f3dabdda3cea061f58df83fc8a51; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 217bc8c1add81a28d606e7d3328f69239d47b155; a7b50a6402174cd2ed868461b704e005d80df21d; f9e02232a145ba69c37eeaa331a58510c05a1563; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; dbaa313981754a14e27246b098a6eaad54a45885; 5903301093c7e31d5050404b29ccad8414fc0d29; cb813dfc48247d0b65f1cb1084a5b4bccf6f3de8; bfc80afde667e9e44d654a69963d1b5b3ef2c158; 1a854842f18c5e8ba68f22b3bc24991a380f1c10; dd5671ce482d5bc25a9ec4e323d0fb258f656f71; a29e77d889558d66b8ba7e1728a7fb0cb40068b6; 987dc4f1c871c25e8cdd255874f6d5729626a885; 78596317ad7336a44b231ee624a13a869ff5a96a; 96275946aa7642c6a7b60ea5960629bf7ae6da00; 28b57bf921239943f544b3886aeaacf6bdc5714a; 492d1b37ca3f977e351a1b810357c05f7ab04942; 43e4eb3e50478a83300dc421ee68459f30cdaf1f; 2bc40efcc28ad4ecf162474fea3d0793d0f485c1; e12d9f68f019e562bcdb4404074b4262d14e3915; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 30fdefc9f8984b37c54b62ecd8318226c482379e; 8c4b098479d7edcccdef63ab6d9edc29e6af3e0d; f358f4d61d650d77329479bb82160e2c3c15ef1f; 315ba2317f38bd4fa51069c2ae5d74ee8f000ae5; 50da0dfe287b5b1b0f76fda08c56441e1e17a73b; b86d7c1cdc1533182fd76eb45af1e0dc5d081dac; 34f5ca499d5d8541ac1ac12cef26364a79d31801; 028d7655f29d788c70872d42e9d6346e97ece05d; b5c944e5d11a89b811d1b282c33ff558d1261e73; b7ff2c1a7fbcf7dd8833af6df2b6f2d46214cd56; 12a7c4504dc8c8cc4bae78829f2dcde4fb34047b; 6623457d5501a0e1017d80315d876c78ae45a415; 63013e3d429df8c97f966068dd0df4288ad14c2b; 456d2a4e7b23b0cc86d5caaf3614a63a5232590b; 58d34e510186e385621030703408f0bfaf28ee4a; b7d6037156ea802979ee6d7be0f9e6c4b5bf1eeb; 3193da63f068dc95a5ac9a8fb3810e9ba2c80cd0,BMC Medical Genomics,9,
d29e1836b38ef69b70bf5b8de59992f0ee6d2eab,Genome-wide pathway analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The aims of this study were to identify candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to generate SNP-to-gene-to-pathway hypotheses. An ALS genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset that included 483,051 SNPs in 276 patients with ALS and 271 controls of European descent was used in this study. Identify Candidate Causal SNPs and Pathway (ICSNPathway) analysis was applied to the GWAS dataset. ICSNPathway analysis identified 19 candidate SNPs, 8 genes, and 9 pathways, which provided 8 hypothetical biological mechanisms. The strongest hypothetical biological mechanism was that rs9352 alters the role of chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit A in the context of the pathways of chromatin and nucleosome assembly (nominal P < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.001, 0.018, respectively). The second strongest was rs1046329 â†’ HILS1 â†’ chromatin assembly (nominal P < 0.001, FDR = 0.018).

8a45515826e698b669383f21074e6fdf4b04b43f,Genetic markers for lactation persistency in primiparous Australian dairy cows.,"Good performance in extended lactations of dairy cattle may have a beneficial effect on food costs, health, and fertility. Because data for extended lactation performance is scarce, lactation persistency has been suggested as a suitable selection criterion. Persistency phenotypes were calculated in several ways: P1 was yield relative to an approximate peak, P2 was the slope after peak production, and P3 was a measure derived to be phenotypically uncorrelated to yield and calculated as a function of linear regressions on test-day deviations of days in milk. Phenotypes P1, P2, and P3 were calculated for sires as solutions estimated from a random regression model fitted to milk yield. Because total milk yield, calculated as the sum of daily sire solutions, was correlated to P1 and P2 (r=0.30 and 0.35 for P1 and P2, respectively), P1 and P2 were also adjusted for milk yield (P1adj and P2adj, respectively). To find genomic regions associated with the persistency phenotypes, we used a discovery population of 743 Holstein bulls proven before 2005 and 2 validation data sets of 357 Holstein bulls proven after 2005 and 294 Jersey sires. Two strategies were used to search for genomic regions associated with persistency: 1) persistency solutions were regressed on each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in turn and 2) a genomic selection method (BayesA) was used where all SNP were fitted simultaneously. False discovery rates in the validation data were high (>66% in Holsteins and >77% in Jerseys). However, there were 2 genomic regions on chromosome 6 that validated in both breeds, including a cluster of 6 SNP at around 13.5 to 23.7 Mbp and another cluster of 5 SNP (70.4 to 75.6 Mbp). A third cluster validated in both breeds on chromosome 26 (0.33 to 1.46 Mbp). Validating SNP effects across 2 breeds is unlikely to happen by chance even when false discovery rates within each breed are high. However, marker-assisted selection on these selected SNP may not be the best way to improve this trait because the average variation explained by validated SNP was only 1 to 2%. Genomic selection could be a better alternative. Correlations between genomic breeding values predicted using all SNP simultaneously and estimated breeding values based on progeny test were twice as high as the equivalent correlations between estimated breeding values and parent average. Persistency is a good candidate for genomic selection because the trait is expressed late in lactation.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jennie E. Pryce"", ids = ""6120878""); list(name = ""M.

3431d061ca57edfc11a0435401f5d9da166e14aa,Responses to Matsunaga: It Takes a Family - a Well-Defined Family - to Underwrite Familywise Corrections,"The false discovery rate (FDR) control procedures recommended by Matsunaga require the identification of a family of tests over which the procedures are applied. It is argued that Matsunaga's basis for grouping testsâ€”that all the tests within the same null should be treated as a family, so long as there is a reasoning chain underlying the hypothesisâ€”will, if applied in a principled (consistent) fashion, require bizarre and undesirable research practices. The underlying source of these difficulties appears to be an implicit (and unrealistic) focus on an isolated researcher conducting a single study, as opposed to a community of researchers with many studies and many tests.",2007,Psychology,"list(name = ""Daniel O'Keefe"", ids = ""1405754298"")",7353ae0627fb1e0a7116fef17e7444e0195d76b1; af3e234b1b573b5e0699c12f20be8a498018fd99; 1e029abdc99224e2aa8baa0d70adfbe3dd731036,0d72f1e32e72aa02452a00fa80556c5364f6d7cd; ec964c401ddd81f629f7347dae1f3d6ff74909db,Communication Methods and Measures,1,267-273
3722b9e831b1fbaa50c805375000e9aa81671995,Large-scale identification of single-feature polymorphisms in complex genomes.,"We have developed a high-throughput genotyping platform by hybridizing genomic DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana accessions to an RNA expression GeneChip (AtGenome1). Using newly developed analytical tools, a large number of single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) were identified. A comparison of two accessions, the reference strain Columbia (Col) and the strain Landsberg erecta (Ler), identified nearly 4000 SFPs, which could be reliably scored at a 5% error rate. Ler sequence was used to confirm 117 of 121 SFPs and to determine the sensitivity of array hybridization. Features containing sequence repeats, as well as those from high copy genes, showed greater polymorphism rates. A linear clustering algorithm was developed to identify clusters of SFPs representing potential deletions in 111 genes at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Among the potential deletions were transposons, disease resistance genes, and genes involved in secondary metabolism. The applicability of this technique was demonstrated by genotyping a recombinant inbred line. Recombination break points could be clearly defined, and in one case delimited to an interval of 29 kb. We further demonstrate that array hybridization can be combined with bulk segregant analysis to quickly map mutations. The extension of these tools to organisms with complex genomes, such as Arabidopsis, will greatly increase our ability to map and clone quantitative trait loci (QTL).",2003,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Justin O.

2681f44842f5fa82d33f6abbbe5c92892dfb9c90,Understanding the temporal evolution of neuronal connectivity in cultured networks using statistical analysis,"BackgroundMicro-Electrode Array (MEA) technology allows researchers to perform long-term non-invasive neuronal recordings in-vitro while actively interacting with the cultured neurons. Despite numerous studies carried out using MEAs, many functional, chemical and structural mechanisms of how dissociated cortical neurons develop and respond to external stimuli are not yet well understood because of the lack of quantitative studies that assess how their development can be affected by chronic external stimulation.MethodsTo investigate network changes, we analyzed a large MEA data set composed of neuron spikes recorded from cultures of dissociated rat cortical neurons plated on MEA dishes with 59 recording electrodes each. Neural network activity was recorded during the first five weeks of each cultureâ€™s in-vitro development. Stimulation sessions were delivered to each of the 59 electrodes. The False Discovery Rate technique was used to quantify the temporal evolution of dissociated cortical neurons. Our analysis focused on network responses that occurred within selected time window durations, namely 50 ms, 100 ms and 150 ms after stimulus onset.ResultsOur results show an evolution in dissociated cortical neuronal network activity over time, that reflects the network synaptic evolution. Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of our technique to different observation time windows and found that varying the time windows, allows us to capture different dynamics of the observed responses. In addition, when selecting a 150 ms observation time window, our findings indicate that cultures dissociated from the same brain tissue display trends in their temporal evolution that are more similar than those obtained from different brains.ConclusionOur results emphasize that the FDR technique can be implemented without the need to make any particular assumptions about the data a priori. The proposed technique was able to capture the well-known dissociated cortical neuron networksâ€™ temporal evolution, that has been previously observed in in-vivo and in intact brain tissue studies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the time window that is used to capture the stimulus-evoked network responses is a critical parameter to analyze the electrical behavioral and temporal evolution of dissociated cortical neurons.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alessandro Napoli"", ids = ""153612119""); list(name = ""Jichun Xie"", ids = ""4999927""); list(name = ""Iyad Obeid"", ids = ""34756848"")",a79edd0092706b8b2023664e001cf692e49c7ac2; 917b0587d2308df40ac550f1a5d3c9b19b281726; be460120044201fb0cac827c8a72839ab6ea2767; 978de3b5cfd637ae1bfbb20bc7161ee77abda654; f83fc3cb4db20e79b54bbbc61609c0615cb727ea; f26115b41b72cea80fae0af1b8a767a111a548bb; 2681f44842f5fa82d33f6abbbe5c92892dfb9c90; beb0390217aa8ff4cd17f95d8f2c792982016467; 4bf19834129e7975ae75068714b291b7d19e708f; 30b17b984ffb41e95fe9d6a3147409c48d4284c3,71a861ddb66123f300e459910791aca064b0a540; 2319d83c32a895d6713331c464ed794676cf43d8; 0a04c261814c789d8f7dff434fe1c451f3aff894; fc0eaf9fa471f872df67f0ea1b2e97660d18e758; de5355c5704ffa1191ec2bd68f66a20d7f4c6863; d23c567f7f521bc49a67ebfd70a4ad2e795a5d23; 34f6ff3ada68fcd0e71c1ecd93903ec290e6cd0e; 4d6efef5679e81d3c4cc9ba20586864726be8778; 05e3424e1589a3b861a05a846e1d2d75b2f70adc; d67ed61b7bb549e618d6141262d36ab386ba7973; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; c9fe64c286023e49694da836a5e66c5b50fe06d8; 66155c8c2a5e3d019b8417e7dc6661a9a5f24809; 25a75ede015468c36b2daed01da94c97867b6103; de02b93c9fc2a022046ece1ae6bc59464e4314d0; 524ca02507dda3c86f2a86a03cd2aa9470574428; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; f79b05bb354340d1eaef0a5748966f8adaea0f63; ab9bf25c54fa9cfffd18cad5e0cb4dd9a3dfa208; d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e; 49d8441daeaf291ce6cb51937687cc16bcc35a94; 74bd5d126937a0cca89b640b82a7e5be7259794d; c144737f89f2b0b4e9faad2c053ffc2a798ee94a; a82598d25f4c2320b105ed04ba7a3a82c44caad7; 2681f44842f5fa82d33f6abbbe5c92892dfb9c90; a1ddd2c5a734a4d88218ac97ee7b9917dec7652b; 5cfce7a30100fa7f4078c0b82f7a2b2c8d00656a; 2dfa8200052fe8963540b1a0ea4c627c8df3f4dc; fdffd7bf6f1cf0e8d5ceca6725dbccd22413d2d6; afb844b9b8939c60f609d7e3ab73ffbdc627685a; 90b8a06fbd491e7bf48f5c03da857fe817216940; 5b1cfa648cf7b86a21b5f4d0152996f629c4626c; 27b634d95f1dcdbe51aa08da6118dd5ee8e31996,BMC Neuroscience,15,17 - 17
87bddf8dff56e308c47d7f07af6b045cb30ff5d5,Cerebrospinal fluid markers to distinguish bacterial meningitis from cerebral malaria in children,"Background. Few hospitals in high malaria endemic countries in Africa have the diagnostic capacity for clinically distinguishing acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) from cerebral malaria (CM). As a result, empirical use of antibiotics is necessary. A biochemical marker of ABM would facilitate precise clinical diagnosis and management of these infections and enable rational use of antibiotics. Methods. We used label-free protein quantification by mass spectrometry to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that distinguish ABM (n=37) from CM (n=22) in Kenyan children. Fold change (FC) and false discovery rates (FDR) were used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Subsequently, potential biomarkers were assessed for their ability to discriminate between ABM and CM using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results. The host CSF proteome response to ABM ( Haemophilusinfluenza and Streptococcuspneumoniae) is significantly different to CM. Fifty two proteins were differentially expressed (FDR<0.01, Log FCâ‰¥2), of which 83% (43/52) were upregulated in ABM compared to CM. Myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin were present in 37 (100%) and 36 (97%) of ABM cases, respectively, but absent in CM (n=22). Area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were assessed for myeloperoxidase (1, 1, and 1; 95% CI, 1-1) and lactotransferrin (0.98, 0.97, and 1; 95% CI, 0.96-1). Conclusion. Myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin have a high potential to distinguish ABM from CM and thereby improve clinical management. Their validation requires a larger cohort of samples that includes other bacterial aetiologies of ABM.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""James M Njunge"", ids = ""48504851""); list(name = ""Ian N Oyaro"", ids = ""35555776""); list(name = ""Nelson K Kibinge"", ids = ""3421143""); list(name = ""Martin K.

We utilized plasma and serum specimens from TB patients and their contacts (ageâ‰¥12) enrolled in a household contact study in Uganda. In the discovery phase cross-sectional samples from 104 HIV-uninfected persons classified as either active TB, latent Mtb infection (LTBI), tuberculin skin test (TST) converters, or persistent TST-negative were analyzed. Two hundred eighty-nine statistically significant (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) differentially expressed proteins were identified across all comparisons. Proteins associated with cellular immunity and lipid metabolism were induced early after Mtb infection. One hundred and fifty-nine proteins were selected for a targeted mass spectrometry assay. A set of longitudinal samples from 52 TST-negative subjects who converted to TST-positive or remained TST-negative were analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify unique protein panels able to predict TST conversion with cross-validated AUC>0.85. Panel performance was confirmed with an independent validation set of longitudinal samples from 16 subjects. These candidate protein biomarkers may allow for the identification of recently Mtb infected individuals at highest risk for developing active TB and most likely to benefit from preventive therapy.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Charles M.

0078536e9014b4ee03dc328456260a1f57275ff2,Associations of Osteopontin and NT-proBNP with Circulating miRNA Levels in Acute Coronary Syndrome.,"The genomic regulatory networks underlying the pathogenesis of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) are incompletely understood. As intermediate traits, protein biomarkers report on underlying disease severity and prognosis in NSTE-ACS. We hypothesized that integration of dense microRNA (miRNA) profiling with biomarker measurements would highlight potential regulatory pathways that underlie the relationships between prognostic biomarkers, miRNAs, and cardiovascular phenotypes. We performed miRNA sequencing using whole blood from 186 patients from the TRILOGY-ACS trial. Seven circulating prognostic biomarkers were measured: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteopontin (OPN), myeloperoxidase, growth differentiation factor 15, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and neopterin. MiRNAs were tested for association with each biomarker using generalized linear models and controlling the false discovery rate at 0.05. Ten miRNAs, including known cardiac-related miRNAs 25-3p and 423-3p, were associated with NT-proBNP levels (min. p=7.5x10-4) and 48 miRNAs, including cardiac-related miRNAs 378a-3p, 20b-5p and 320a, -b and -d, were associated with OPN levels (min. p=1.6x10-6). NT-proBNP and OPN were also associated with time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in the sample. By integrating large-scale miRNA profiling with circulating biomarkers as intermediate traits, we identified associations of known cardiac-related and novel miRNAs with two prognostic biomarkers, and identified potential genomic networks regulating these biomarkers. These results, highlighting plausible biological pathways connecting miRNAs with biomarkers and outcomes, may inform future studies seeking to delineate genomic pathways underlying NSTE-ACS outcomes.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lydia Coulter Kwee"", ids = ""88558659""); list(name = ""Megan L.

f62bbce0ac80415d77f3761f4609a81a0a1d90ab,Improving Indel Detection Specificity of the Ion Torrent PGM Benchtop Sequencer,"The emergence of benchtop sequencers has made clinical genetic testing using next-generation sequencing more feasible. Ion Torrent's PGMâ„¢ is one such benchtop sequencer that shows clinical promise in detecting single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and microindel variations (indels). However, the large number of false positive indels caused by the high frequency of homopolymer sequencing errors has impeded PGMâ„¢'s usage for clinical genetic testing. An extensive analysis of PGMâ„¢ data from the sequencing reads of the well-characterized genome of the Escherichia coli DH10B strain and sequences of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from six germline samples was done. Three commonly used variant detection tools, SAMtools, Dindel, and GATK's Unified Genotyper, all had substantial false positive rates for indels. By incorporating filters on two major measures we could dramatically improve false positive rates without sacrificing sensitivity. The two measures were: B-Allele Frequency (BAF) and VARiation of the Width of gaps and inserts (VARW) per indel position. A BAF threshold applied to indels detected by UnifiedGenotyper removed ~99% of the indel errors detected in both the DH10B and BRCA sequences. The optimum BAF threshold for BRCA sequences was determined by requiring 100% detection sensitivity and minimum false discovery rate, using variants detected from Sanger sequencing as reference. This resulted in 15 indel errors remaining, of which 7 indel errors were removed by selecting a VARW threshold of zero. VARW specific errors increased in frequency with higher read depth in the BRCA datasets, suggesting that homopolymer-associated indel errors cannot be reduced by increasing the depth of coverage. Thus, using a VARW threshold is likely to be important in reducing indel errors from data with higher coverage. In conclusion, BAF and VARW thresholds provide simple and effective filtering criteria that can improve the specificity of indel detection in PGMâ„¢ data without compromising sensitivity.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhen Xuan Yeo"", ids = ""1714092""); list(name = ""Maurice Chan"", ids = ""50101456""); list(name = ""Yoon Sim Yap"", ids = ""34389931""); list(name = ""Peter Ang"", ids = ""40455010""); list(name = ""Steve Rozen"", ids = ""2109309""); list(name = ""Ann Siew Gek Lee"", ids = ""34696407"")",d6568eb27ea870fe973753ab541db3c0afadb05b; da5877517fe806dab1a0ce07798c41f7948f79de; 9cca4f3b54c6a1c261ee9da30f0b4b887d47fa68; 9dbb6bcd736f4847a087a0077e5bdc32e19ea840; c51c14e90749a58bacf602e356d8e6ab05705789; bcf9095ee975d1772476f300c87327a5879a9c6c; 541668f9ff25fceba4cd592a20c000b003893bcf; f3c027ad1595d359ef3acbfa7b87aa261ae9de78; cb9c4e088d0bd8375b5f7c94580023a50c6b1f07; ee3698f1c3ae7d038bc139e9fb42bdd579c99207; b616592f98b6602a5a417fe2f22e1427420f9c04; d11aaf712ed1347c1467a8a3021ce6afe84c40e7; ce59474bc6a7d1e8d83a500e68ff0beb03591e9e; e0459ce1992354206fd091f02f671ab354c07178; 5760d534d74863cc5e4aa34bd036816fd297e706; 9e48dd81678630a7f530be7f9b75dcfb8d8d49cb; 9a91b18617efba1314861d787e6d0c9dcb6c629d; 52370c4c29ac85f32956f357ac4fe9e82a4f6291; 9aa359a9e4103b26e04a80902b08c908a8ea410b; d394b3653799e3c42c3ff33eb8d964564452ce07; 23e1b6efd41377b4c127e2809541036c9a836948; 4dcf03b0800ba044f2968d20aade1508384aa381; 2cb22fe4726561118c617438553bd15972146124; 38427ddaaeea6f467b37b0916ca74ad68b66c5a5; f6b4376d9d7cf3cef49afb2921c4066030e924fb; 8d8e3318ca3e62930f4ec5242ae56d42844ba53d; e2cb0ba044e697f0542c54f68a5c2415443f1088; 14015d37ecbf4201300c93d6355b93c9d1634629; 8bb9d4d31019ded447159f571ae4d9bc684534fb; 1442c2e617e3a39cadf46fb437758be751a908cf; ea0f13babc337ddc44d54c11a9b82330127573de; 07f8e5b03e4e7b04c3b0de48987c5b10c5a7f8c6; 663ff8d2cac1fd742e3cb06d89732c7ec7d83951; 8ea724965d9d65ebd64b8be2e61cd8efcf64ec76; 8a465e203347b076432a84d870610b8ee3f360c6; 713c572061a449aa8b6ae153dd194c559c18e2d6,d31f2a2f8dbf56eb90fe787074bc17e7a4a8be2d; e9f63896900355068c62011cab771cdd8a34af80; 63c0530c84e9241e877ab69d49677512fa9789f7; 0f12ed1ae292a17b4c157ace9b13ee125749371b; b34ce200994baeb855680bb3f850477ba9882452; cc3bd78e0f5c2c902e2cf5954c84a25160c839a9; ffd5cf84156ba951efa1adf9cc1f09c0ec1dd5a3; 05cd3c85614da3ce15935404328bfda0826de48c; 059e8ca993ce5b09c4bb3dbd08579008c437806d; d46203f98b706ade43388496775bfc920aa17422; d7b02543a0536923fcd660217c6d7f821adcd30d; cfef00bab9d840102b9fb2eb91079b2200ca4058; 0a8051b00cb24e07d605473d815845281148a7bb; 509811cab9747a724335604e776df0e980ef094a; a18e30bf5fa15424666f5fe1401086d7770415ec; fe8ad6a68898256f63072a07d550231f037f6443; fd39d338da5aff17474ca96deacc86d619a44d83; 630f0cb7242b62d834c23bf85e819f725503af7c; 8faf969546fdc774ebd07b8f7f7e83de29b4f09f; caed768735bed84d2e78fe385d8d824fc3282456; 0fa38f3e7a876f49b4991c66c83227f3fab2f6a1; f942cf8a040a874468b84d42b1aa73cec48fe02f; 5e6bdb8061c4e420704f206ab760bc8b83cfacdc; 085589ca53509ad27edd95827f7198b3ce107024; 073aeea8c1e5c261d2fc9d6f91fd20bfa3d04013; 4c59597e6fff540efa9f4ac72ec7de5ec4f3caa2; 1a7da46c6bcaac3e501ad3e1190b8180d08eccfd; 2fffdffb89ae9f28fa3d32bef1606fe7a32bc738; b1abf125ee210202d05d9e21df121531e0f6b759; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8; 7c84507d717e36b1563dfb180f43bc2ea2893869,PLoS ONE,7,
f0f47deb5639fb8749c432365f6d44da0e7265ba,"Identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR2D gene, GRIN2D, and association study with schizophrenia.","OBJECTIVES
The glutamatergic dysfunction is one of the main hypotheses for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are of major interest because phencyclidine, a non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, produces a schizophrenia-like psychosis. Therefore, the genes encoding N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits are strong candidates for schizophrenia susceptibility genes. We focused on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR2D gene in the case-control study of schizophrenia.


METHODS
We screened for polymorphisms in exons, exon-intron boundaries and the 5' upstream region of GRIN2D by direct sequencing in 32 Japanese patients. Out of the total 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified, we genotyped 200-201 Japanese patients and 219-221 controls for nine common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (minor allele frequency over 0.05).


RESULTS
None of the nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between cases and controls. We observed significant associations of pairwise haplotypes in three combinations of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms, INT10SNP-EX13SNP2, EX13SNP2-EX13SNP3 and EX6SNP-EX13SNP2, with the disease even after the Bonferroni correction (P=1.094 x 10(-6), Pcorrected=2.297 x 10(-5), P=2.825 x 10(-6), Pcorrected=5.933 x 10(-5) and P=2.02 x 10(-4), Pcorrected=4.242 x 10(-3), respectively). The same results were also obtained using the false discovery rate (BL) method at the threshold P value, 2.908 x 10(-3).


CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that the GRIN2D locus is a possible genomic region contributing to schizophrenia susceptibility in the Japanese population.",2005,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chieko Makino"", ids = ""13419689""); list(name = ""Hiroki Shibata"", ids = ""2981383""); list(name = ""Hideaki Ninomiya"", ids = ""35215264""); list(name = ""Nobutada Tashiro"", ids = ""2498133""); list(name = ""Yasuyuki Fukumaki"", ids = ""6193051"")",d820b416e6771f684d11b3e5557890eae3fdf8de; 0a2970a11d08efd3bf16de2695049eb626aa57ec; d5ab37c4dddcaa5723a697ea3475c58d48a73ec7; b3708755eccf96224e9fe2b4e68460b19a6e8501; 21398c4ad6e4c87a2e19ecda0fd2fab4be788ac8; 73ace952de67a22e7134d01e76d5325ce2f6dd2b; 666e540cede5f57f92703ddbc53740d63e346948; cde14ac5e3db35c4094202456855df385d976817; ba2facd7eb0bc5810b246712b5cc02b5a25897a4; f3fad28c5adbbe4f04b2b3539cf142781c0c5be0; efb8f399e00a243b1ea6f427cd080d809188b7a6; 41b53aa882c40f7f1c51fc1cebf8ef7904d52459; 9c5c799feeda77bdbee1e654e87542bbeb60a677; 743f947dee343a8bab6c12c22808b187eb8ea9f7; 450d25c90de3fcdd51b701b3dd950f10edd2bef1; ece789d42d967ee671eb7626f09361b15ecda526; 3452e9bf3f708441f2db10900dc5a1baa2a05af8; 21b0e90a97280c0f971fdabc78ff3d6f88edf8c2; 48ede7bfb50cc472eaa001aab2011eb23a063344; b07fdc4e5dcc7d2bcf7feeefbfc043bfe7450b50; f531cca7e4ee0311784b001171086f8f651633d3,ecd9a590c19b7943979ef8e96a1508830804a69f; cc4e5284e3706d10dfd0af6980f1d262cba41c04; 9f84b23773780547812964728aa77b2c6edb40d2; 9bb566d8f89f7db0c2e971743724753ef224993c; 953e149ba2ee55e1cb20beef79cae4811200c35d; 5001bd47b23f5793a38ba65b9547048cde9c78bd; f2e2362f313a8b4aff112210471d77bebeb41ce6; a10b4df84a4f4b27b4101cbbb89877605cb99a2a; f634f90740efbfda5328e622780de8b0c44dbb94; 462538f0ef6ceaf5af6c8664d71d86f2b93990d1; 6bd529395e1b3ce5590bc34f7f5a2ec800e1f738; 5e4e4a7e68b994984c1963f55cfb4a0781bd7c4f; df14e30589e95133a332f1cb16fa4474ad8ebdb3; 931595a60616fad840f638daa64ba4e449c65a34; e28addac9fd858e73a7e64c6d54f7c1778ec1960; 9d875d7a42afae545f88caffabfe2cbded396a8b; 0aad587d2e19cb8f3d1416d7be0220e8da3f8426; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 59653ba5b9eb3d812fddb44b8ac4661caa008730; 8938794eb54d60f1c301abee8fb1cbb8ae18e87d; c28c40dd86dc1847cb6b4999c3c1e10437f489a7; 0ad11ac16105aa27aa7a0992fc3ba97a1214ae16; 907ddb3a08dcb77f0057ff15b67e9361c2f576b7; 1999e84e0c671f17e211fa86cfcf3e746d955436; 279e0f13e917cdf076f29082e00a91c057768ff8; cd487f92351b6cf66ec3ad924c410feee554079f; 2b30477ab2c6a85004c53d02518fd0fbfb960cec; 9199ae620f38321977d3b7423c8fbd6c25d30f37; a35b4a23e525e48a4df6b546470930041737da1e; 7544ebeb24cf320f5e3e6f68f4fa973234ccdd1c; 03b3715c866285aa035e9617dd9356d8534e4f70; ce288e1ec4deef01b098349dfce17adc351dc083,Psychiatric genetics,15 3,"

This situation is improved by pairing fluorophores with activator dyes, which enhances fluorescence signals but restricts its application in biomedical studies. To address this issue, we optimized STORM imaging conditions for sparsely-distributing Alexa-647 samples simultaneously illuminated by a 641-nm excitation and a 405-nm reactivation lasers. We found that, compared to a frame frequency of 46 Hz or 85 Hz in STORM imaging, low frequency (20 Hz) resulted in a relatively high background fluorescence but had no obvious effect on specific signals of Alexa-647 in cell-free samples. In fixed human cells, high frequency (85 Hz) was superior in distinguishing sparse Alexa-647 fluorophores from cellular autofluorescence. Furthermore, a small false discovery rate was achieved with the use of moderate but not intensive powers of excitation and reactivation lasers. With the selected rather than original frame frequency and laser intensity, low fluorescence background and high detection efficiency of fluorophores were obtained for cell samples sparsely labeled with a range of Alexa-647 concentrations. Therefore, this study optimized STORM imaging conditions and promoted detection sensitivity and efficiency of single molecules in cells in an activator dye-independent way.",2016,Materials Science,"list(name = ""Bo Cao"", ids = ""48437993""); list(name = ""Tszshan Ma"", ids = ""10792295""); list(name = ""Gang Niu"", ids = ""47537663""); list(name = ""Danni Chen"", ids = ""4194168""); list(name = ""Jianjiang Hu"", ids = ""47756394""); list(name = ""Chen Xu"", ids = ""144282087""); list(name = ""Yanxiang Ni"", ids = ""47018556""); list(name = ""Michael Q.

b8334c79d515a05c0cf96ed133528a927e8d7292,Shared genetic risk between migraine and coronary artery disease: A genome-wide analysis of common variants,"Migraine is a recurrent pain condition traditionally viewed as a neurovascular disorder, but little is known of its vascular basis. In epidemiological studies migraine is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting shared pathogenic mechanisms. This study aimed to determine the genetic overlap between migraine and CAD, and to identify shared genetic risk loci, utilizing a conditional false discovery rate approach and data from two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CAD (C4D, 15,420 cases, 15,062 controls; CARDIoGRAM, 22,233 cases, 64,762 controls) and one of migraine (22,120 cases, 91,284 controls). We found significant enrichment of genetic variants associated with CAD as a function of their association with migraine, which was replicated across two independent CAD GWAS studies. One shared risk locus in the PHACTR1 gene (conjunctional false discovery rate for index SNP rs9349379 < 3.90 x 10-5), which was also identified in previous studies, explained much of the enrichment. Two further loci (in KCNK5 and AS3MT) showed evidence for shared risk (conjunctional false discovery rate < 0.05). The index SNPs at two of the three loci had opposite effect directions in migraine and CAD. Our results confirm previous reports that migraine and CAD share genetic risk loci in excess of what would be expected by chance, and highlight one shared risk locus in PHACTR1. Understanding the biological mechanisms underpinning this shared risk is likely to improve our understanding of both disorders.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bendik Slagsvold Winsvold"", ids = ""4209010""); list(name = ""Francesco Bettella"", ids = ""2792807""); list(name = ""Aree Witoelar"", ids = ""2222549""); list(name = ""Verneri Anttila"", ids = ""2063097""); list(name = ""Padhraig Gormley"", ids = ""1996886""); list(name = ""Tobias Kurth"", ids = ""5094451""); list(name = ""Gisela M.

7a4ea098a7c3d86f0974cd584bc6a84b608b98c2,Discovery and Validation of Barrett's Esophagus MicroRNA Transcriptome by Next Generation Sequencing,"OBJECTIVE
Barrett's esophagus (BE) is transition from squamous to columnar mucosa as a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The role of microRNA during this transition has not been systematically studied.


DESIGN
For initial screening, total RNA from 5 GERD and 6 BE patients was size fractionated. RNA <70 nucleotides was subjected to SOLiD 3 library preparation and next generation sequencing (NGS). Bioinformatics analysis was performed using R package ""DEseq"". A p value<0.05 adjusted for a false discovery rate of 5% was considered significant. NGS-identified miRNA were validated using qRT-PCR in an independent group of 40 GERD and 27 BE patients. MicroRNA expression of human BE tissues was also compared with three BE cell lines.


RESULTS
NGS detected 19.6 million raw reads per sample. 53.1% of filtered reads mapped to miRBase version 18. NGS analysis followed by qRT-PCR validation found 10 differentially expressed miRNA; several are novel (-708-5p, -944, -224-5p and -3065-5p). Up- or down- regulation predicted by NGS was matched by qRT-PCR in every case. Human BE tissues and BE cell lines showed a high degree of concordance (70-80%) in miRNA expression. Prediction analysis identified targets that mapped to developmental signaling pathways such as TGFÎ² and Notch and inflammatory pathways such as toll-like receptor signaling and TGFÎ². Cluster analysis found similarly regulated (up or down) miRNA to share common targets suggesting coordination between miRNA.


CONCLUSION
Using highly sensitive next-generation sequencing, we have performed a comprehensive genome wide analysis of microRNA in BE and GERD patients. Differentially expressed miRNA between BE and GERD have been further validated. Expression of miRNA between BE human tissues and BE cell lines are highly correlated. These miRNA should be studied in biological models to further understand BE development.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ajay Bansal"", ids = ""145941573""); list(name = ""In-hee Lee"", ids = ""144337278""); list(name = ""Xiaoman Hong"", ids = ""34600118""); list(name = ""Sharad C.

01f80ccac8d1147a2f7bcea36b375795a6f88e6d,Significance estimation for large scale metabolomics annotations by spectral matching,"The annotation of small molecules in untargeted mass spectrometry relies on the matching of fragment spectra to reference library spectra. While various spectrum-spectrum match scores exist, the field lacks statistical methods for estimating the false discovery rates (FDR) of these annotations. We present empirical Bayes and target-decoy based methods to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) for 70 public metabolomics data sets. We show that the spectral matching settings need to be adjusted for each project. By adjusting the scoring parameters and thresholds, the number of annotations rose, on average, by +139% (ranging from âˆ’92 up to +5705%) when compared with a default parameter set available at GNPS. The FDR estimation methods presented will enable a user to assess the scoring criteria for large scale analysis of mass spectrometry based metabolomics data that has been essential in the advancement of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics science.Matching fragment spectra to reference library spectra is an important procedure for annotating small molecules in untargeted mass spectrometry based metabolomics studies.

a4bffc60fce2def54e87eb6a106fdc6d0c0e8d09,Topics on multiple hypotheses testing and generalized linear model,"TOPICS ON MULTIPLE HYPOTHESES TESTING AND GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL by Yalin Zhu In applications such as studying drug adverse events (AE) in clinical trials and identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments, the data of the experiments usually consists of frequency counts. In the analysis of such data, researchers often face multiple hypotheses testing based on discrete test statistics. Incorporating this discrete property of the data, several stepwise procedures, which allow to use the CDF of p-values to determine the testing threshold, are proposed for controlling familiwise error rate (FWER). It is shown that the proposed procedures strongly control the FWER and are more powerful than the existing ones for discrete data. Through some simulation studies and real data examples, the proposed procedures are shown to outperform the existing procedures in terms of the FWER control and power. An R package â€œMHTdiscreteâ€ and a web application are developed for implementing the proposed procedures for discrete data. Many complex biomedical studies, such as clinical safety studies and genome-wide association studies, often involve testing multiple families of hypotheses. Most existing multiple testing methods cannot guarantee strong control of appropriate type 1 error rates suitable for such increasingly complex research questions. A novel two-stage procedure based on the recently developed idea of selective inference for clinical safety studies is introduced. In the first stage, some significant families are selected by using some family-level global test, which guarantees control of generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER) among the selected families. In the second stage, individual hypotheses are tested for each selected families by using some multiple testing procedure, which controls conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) based on the fact that the family is selected. By applying the proposed procedure to clinical safety studies, one can not only efficiently flag the significant clinical adverse events (AEs) but also select body systems of interest (BSoI) as extra information for further research. The simulation studies show that the proposed procedure can be more reliable than alternative methods such as Mehrotra and Heyseâ€™s double FDR procedure in the setting of clinical safety. The proposed procedure for multiple families structure is implemented in the R package â€œMHTmultâ€. Categorical data arises in biomedical and healthcare experiments naturally. In many of these cases, the outcome variables of interest are the numbers of special events. At least one distinct special event category is observed, when the negative multinomial and extended negative multinomial or generalized inverse sampling scheme-based regression models are used. The new model, based on generalized inverse sampling scheme for several special events, is developed in this dissertation. This research is an adaption to the widely used multinomial logistic regression model. The resulting equations of the proposed model, corresponding to the natural log of the ratio of the expected responses, appears similar to the multinomial logistic regression. Using this expected response ratio of a category to that of the special category, the maximum likelihood estimator of the regression parameters can be computed by creating score equations and the Hessian matrix of the likelihood. The covariance matrix of estimators of the regression parameters for the new model can be estimated by inverting the Hessian matrix to develop the inference.

afd8291d4d99fb41c1c81fe2a064d67817a1b349,A Genomic Profile of the Immune Response to Stroke With Implications for Stroke Recovery,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the change in gene expression between two time points following stroke and to identify biomarkers of stroke recovery through gene expression profiling and pathway analysis. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 34 ischemic stroke patients (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging) â‰¥18 years of age, within 24 hr of symptom onset and 24â€“48 hr later, and from healthy controls. The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) was used to determine 30-day recovery. Total RNA was extracted from whole blood in Paxgene RNA tubes, amplified, and hybridized to Illumina HumanRef-8v2 bead chips. Gene expression was compared in a univariate manner between stroke patients at both time points and good versus bad outcome using t-test in GeneSpring. Inflation of Type 1 error was corrected by false discovery rate (FDR), and Ingenuity Systems Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed. A secondary validation cohort was recruited from a local hospital. Results: Three genes were significantly downregulated over time (LY96, IL8, and SDPR; FDR corrected p < .05). This finding was confirmed in a validation cohort of stroke patients (n = 8). IPA revealed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) signaling was the most significant pathway present in the peripheral whole blood of stroke patients 24â€“48 hr after onset. When controlling for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, high baseline expression of TLR2 and TLR4 significantly predicted worse scores on the MRS. Conclusion: CTLA4 signaling is a novel pathway for the study of stroke-induced immune suppression. Markers of immune dysfunction early after stroke may prove useful for identifying patients with increased risk of poor recovery.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Taura L.

It is applied to estimating the empirical distribution of the 'sampling probabilities' of m sampled items. The estimated empirical distribution is used to modify the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. The performance of the modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator is studied in two examples. In one example the sampling probabilities are estimated based on the number of visits until a response was obtained. The other example is based on real data from panel sampling, where in four consecutive months there are corresponding four attempts to interview each member in a panel. The sampling probabilities are estimated based on the number of successful attempts.

60caa0db5d39d8b73545ddd1c5444a8b2a3fb7cf,Expression of ABCA7 in Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"Liu and colleagues compiled evidence from publicly available datasets of microarray-based and RNA sequencing gene expression to conclude that ABCA7 gene expression is increased in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) [3]. While at this stage, it cannot be excluded that increased expression of ABCA7 increases risk of AD, these observations have to be interpreted with caution. Liu and colleagues are correct in stating that the risk allele at the genome-wide association study (GWAS) index SNP rs4147929 is associated with increased rather than decreased expression of ABCA7 in GTEx data on cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere [3]. In other brain regions, including those characteristically affected by AD, the evidence is less convincing. Importantly, the associations presented in Table 1 of their correspondence do not pass false discovery rate (FDR), with exception of those in cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere [3]. ABCA7 is expressed at low abundance in most brain regions (median number of transcripts per million < 10), which can easily give rise to spurious findings. In addition, rs4147929 is a GWAS index SNP that is not necessarily directly associated with AD. Increasing repeat length of a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in ABCA7, which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs4147929, was associated with lower levels of ABCA7 expression [1], although this observation awaits replication. None of the studies re-analyzed by Liu and colleagues provides evidence of a significantly reduced expression of ABCA7 in AD brain. Yet caution is warranted in concluding the opposite based on the presented evidence. Liu and colleagues show differential expression of ABCA7 between patients and controls without taking into account multiple testing corrections [3], and fold changes are small. While one of the AMP-AD cohorts shows weak evidence of increased expression of ABCA7 in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in AD patients (log fold change 0.135, adjusted p value 0.0472; www.agora .ampad porta l.org, accessed Feb 17, 2020), none of the other cohorts and brain regions in AMPAD show an increase in expression. In a recent meta-analysis of AD brain expression data, no differential expression of ABCA7 is reported [5]. More importantly, the datasets queried by Liu and colleagues are based on bulk tissue. The cell type composition of brain tissue changes in neurodegenerative brain disease, which may confound the interpretation of differences in gene expression between patients and controls. Moreover, post-mortem brain data may miss disease-related expression alterations early in the disease process. Comparison between bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing of the ROSMAP cohort indicates that expression levels in bulk brain tissue are mainly driven by gene expression in excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes. Expression changes in the other (less abundant) cell types may thus go unobserved in bulk data [4]. ABCA7 is subject to abundant alternative splicing, and different isoforms may have cell type or tissuespecific expression or function that is currently overlooked. It is still unknown in which tissue(s) or cell type(s) ABCA7 exerts its AD risk increasing effects. Conceivably, expression is upregulated in one cell type, and downregulated in another, similar to the observation that APOE expression is upregulated in microglia, and downregulated in astrocytes in AD [4]. In contrast to how Liu and colleagues [3] summarize our review on ABCA7, we do not claim that a decrease in ABCA7 expression is the main pathological mechanism in AD [2]. The observation of premature termination codon (PTC) mutations in ABCA7 as risk factors for AD has made it a plausible hypothesis, backed by in vivo and in vitro studies [reviewed in 2]. Nevertheless, we caution against hasty inferences, amongst others because of the above-mentioned challenges in studying the effect of ABCA7 expression in AD [2], which also affect the results presented by Liu and colleagues. * Kristel Sleegers kristel.sleegers@uantwerpen.vib.be",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kristel Sleegers"", ids = ""6013036"")",,ccf4ef38e47fa42beb2e28d4f30f9ffc46bab103; 9848bf0866911767accab414c086e2d351fbb500; 1a5ecc5d568940e0eb864daf1265f9b7638776c5; ed430fe39f6fe4988ea212f108acc81c10f75c30,Acta Neuropathologica,139,941 - 942
e62e9178ee780bb692c696aa3793e51144474b90,Functional network connectivity of pain-related resting state networks in somatoform pain disorder: an exploratory fMRI study.,"BACKGROUND
Without stimulation, the human brain spontaneously produces highly organized, low-frequency fluctuations of neural activity in intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Furthermore, without adequate explanatory nociceptive input, patients with somatoform pain disorder experience pain symptoms, thus implicating a central dysregulation of pain homeostasis. The present study aimed to test whether interactions among pain-related ICNs, such as the default mode network (DMN), cingular-insular network (CIN) and sensorimotor network (SMN), are altered in somatoform pain during resting conditions.


METHODS
Patients with somatoform pain disorder and healthy controls underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging that lasted 370 seconds. Using a data-driven approach, the ICNs were isolated, and the functional network connectivity (FNC) was computed.


RESULTS
Twenty-one patients and 19 controls enrolled in the study. Significant FNC (p < 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate) was detected between the CIN and SMN/anterior DMN, the anterior DMN and posterior DMN/SMN, and the posterior DMN and SMN. Interestingly, no group differences in FNC were detected.


LIMITATIONS
The most important limitation of this study was the relatively short resting state paradigm.


CONCLUSION

They act as external controlling elements in haematopoiesis and also mediateand control immune and inflammatory responses. Changes in cytokine levels havebeen reported in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a common inflammatorydisease of the airways. Similarly, changes in circulating cytokine levels havebeen reported in other pulmonary disorders including lung cancer, but the specificnature of these changes is poorly defined. Because cytokines normally function as partof a complex interacting network, the use of a multiplexed approach for their determinationis important. Biochip array technology enables such an approach and cangenerate a cytokine profile from a single sample, at a single point in time. The aimof this study was to determine twelve cytokines simultaneously in the plasma ofnon-smokers and smokers with or without COPD and with or without lung cancerusing Evidence biochip array technology. The cytokines IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, IFNc, EGF, MCP-1 and TNFa were quantified by simultaneous chemiluminescentimmunoassays on the biochip array. The biochip represents the solidphaseand the vessel where the immunoreactions take place in discrete test sites.The Evidence analyzer was used for all determinations. Serum samples from 55non-smokers, 54 smokers without COPD and 48 smokers with COPD were analyzed.The Kruskal-Wallis test with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.10 was used to identifycytokines that were differentially expressed across the 5 groups. For the cytokinesthat met the FDR criterion, post-hoc comparisons were made using Dunnâ€™s methodwith a family-wise error rate 0f 0.05.Four cytokines appeared to be differentially expressed across groups: IL-6, IL-8,VEGF and MCP1. Results of the post-hoc pairwise comparisons suggest plasma cytokinelevels are significantly different between the following groups: non-smokers vs.adenocarcinoma (IL-6, IL-8); non-smokers vs. squamous cell cancer (IL-6, IL-8, VEGF);non-smokers vs. smokers with COPD (MCP1); smokers without COPD vs. adenocarcinoma(IL-6); smokers with COPD vs. squamous cell carcinoma (IL-6); smokers withoutCOPD vs. squamous cell carcinoma (IL-6, IL-8, VEGF) and adenocarcinoma vs.squamous cell carcinoma (VEGF, IL-8).

2d36f9ad2ace2a94d9668087afbf283d0b535c89,Microarray analysis reveals key genes and pathways in Tetralogy of Fallot,"The aim of the present study was to identify key genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) using bioinformatics methods. The GSE26125 microarray dataset, which includes cardiovascular tissue samples derived from 16 children with TOF and five healthy ageâ€‘matched control infants, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential expression analysis was performed between TOF and control samples to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Student's tâ€‘test, and the R/limma package, with a log2 foldâ€‘change of >2 and a false discovery rate of <0.01 set as thresholds. The biological functions of DEGs were analyzed using the ToppGene database. The ReactomeFIViz application was used to construct functional interaction (FI) networks, and the genes in each module were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis. The iRegulon plugin was used to identify transcription factors predicted to regulate the DEGs in the FI network, and the geneâ€‘transcription factor pairs were then visualized using Cytoscape software. A total of 878 DEGs were identified, including 848 upregulated genes and 30 downregulated genes. The gene FI network contained seven function modules, which were all comprised of upregulated genes. Genes enriched in Module 1 were enriched in the following three neurological disorderâ€‘associated signaling pathways: Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Genes in Modules 0, 3 and 5 were dominantly enriched in pathways associated with ribosomes and protein translation. The Xbox binding protein 1 transcription factor was demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of genes encoding the subunits of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes, as well as genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, dysfunction of genes involved in signaling pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders, ribosome function and protein translation may contribute to the pathogenesis of TOF.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yue-e He"", ids = ""15424845""); list(name = ""Hui-xian Qiu"", ids = ""11596342""); list(name = ""Jianbing Jiang"", ids = ""49422985""); list(name = ""Rong-zhou Wu"", ids = ""8227375""); list(name = ""Ru-lian Xiang"", ids = ""7446356""); list(name = ""Yuan-hai Zhang"", ids = ""7548966"")",aa54bacb217e50feb121b93bf323c2effac65de3,0c9ff507e92b5e2a422b11cabd889cb6610dacef; 41ec6663f08d5b9d0ca52dae62e7924f3ebda09a; 52a56e3bc6dc4d5ed0b9558baf340e4ab99909a2; b15d7507ad215915b0607a80ca51fdbf77b0a272; f62d9e88b54ade38c952f9bb0a0361f879d3be86; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; fd0353c6189980cb7e26fef373466fbe972f0505; 40028c7fe0fffe835d30951809bae2d4a8be25d1; 3b88a2cf8a44e8c063945573c83ae7374b4025c1; 2ff4f939ffb3c45c4976806de3b25736d87bcab5; 14929d4794cfc729533d53be5c5e8e505a49ceda; 4f8022deaf2420e0b170a9a701cd4a78084fbf93; 3e13140e6de5cf1550ae9d2c5cd47fe2364b2372; d82409e27ef3db6bfe8fe6e50f385e910257621c; f115677ef9e4f447cca391270c4b2c5c61bc0d4c; 631c31b63338c726c1b4cebd0492e74f5d9ba6dc; d8bd861b292233072aa40ab6bc029ac94d7f30af; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 367aacce3d30a9f76cc5c5a54f91cd29df7d236b; 2d6f853adf08c6459d35104706af89600b65a2bc; 97c3c8508f696470725767de94da354993fd01e1; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; e397c7e7df0123ce206aaccfc525130c9ba18f69; aeac674564f5f05b21d95b63f7598c1502249549; 09d887eab5b726c916f0836aed5ad917fe543ca0; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; ca7849056d4fa1fafc3055f3097185ad9610db74; f25e3f21bf3cd90f1d91816a9544dbeb2fe1af12; aea8b75eba33f2a5e2f1b95c918c855dcdc03ee2; bd63707a754c3561b57016089caa4c34fa0ba245; e92a4f6b9f64f732387154dc4d42725c9ba36092; 018497f8ae6913820d081ceb2975a32988d59add; a430fb190256e993b844f95aaf614478cd38e6ad; 61076194ec631a89daa30edbcc90bc7be37804cc; f1de1c0d09483acce7ab42e21ee44d6c60c29e5d; da97969aa2a305c02e8c90f0ac125661f6a3d570; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 9b46dc252eeb6324d28c12522cdf2eb039509fb6,Molecular Medicine Reports,16,2707 - 2713
1f106238bd56244e4c8819082f0f42642e819a30,EUROmediCAT signal detection: a systematic method for identifying potential teratogenic medication.,"AIMS
Information about medication safety in pregnancy is inadequate. We aimed to develop a signal detection methodology to routinely identify unusual associations between medications and congenital anomalies using data collected by 15 European congenital anomaly registries.


METHODS
EUROmediCAT database data for 14â€‰950 malformed foetuses/babies with first trimester medication exposures in 1995-2011 were analyzed. The odds of a specific medication exposure (coded according to chemical substance or subgroup) for a specific anomaly were compared with the odds of that exposure for all other anomalies for 40â€‰385 medication anomaly combinations in the data. Simes multiple testing procedure with a 50% false discovery rate (FDR) identified associations least likely to be due to chance and those associations with more than two cases with the exposure and the anomaly were selected for further investigation. The methodology was evaluated by considering the detection of well-known teratogens.


RESULTS
The most common exposures were genitourinary system medications and sex hormones (35.2%), nervous system medications (28.0%) and anti-infectives for systemic use (25.7%). Fifty-two specific medication anomaly associations were identified. After discarding 10 overlapping and three protective associations, 39 associations were selected for further investigation. These associations included 16 which concerned well established teratogens, valproic acid (2) and maternal diabetes represented by use of insulin (14).


CONCLUSIONS
Medication exposure data in the EUROmediCAT central database can be analyzed systematically to determine a manageable set of associations for validation and then testing in independent datasets. Detection of teratogens depends on frequency of exposure, level of risk and teratogenic specificity.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Johannes M Luteijn"", ids = ""6573649""); list(name = ""Joan K Morris"", ids = ""31869674""); list(name = ""Ester Garne"", ids = ""3623206""); list(name = ""Joanne E Given"", ids = ""39102758""); list(name = ""Lolkje de Jong-van den Berg"", ids = ""1397952352""); list(name = ""Marie-Claude Addor"", ids = ""115267118""); list(name = ""Marian K.

3523dac7234aed4d8d46eb38a3977a76ad46df2c,107 Insights from roe deer oocyte transcriptome across embryonic diapause,"Embryonic developmental arrest, known as diapause, has been reported in more than 130 species. However, its mechanisms are still not completely understood. In the roe deer, the only known ungulate that exhibits this phenomenon, diapause lasts for approximately 5 months, starting after the rut period in mid-July to early August and ending with embryo elongation and implantation in December/January. Little is known regarding oocyte characteristics during this period. Here, we analysed the roe deer oocyte transcriptome as a model to understand diapause effects on oocyte features during embryonic developmental arrest and reactivation. During regular hunting, immature oocytes were obtained by ovary slicing from diapause and nondiapause stages, and classified according to morphological characteristics. Only oocytes with >2 layers of compact cumulus cells and cytoplasm from 30 hunted females were used for analyses. Immature oocytes were denuded and snap frozen. Additional oocytes were cultured in maturation medium for 20-24â€‰h. Matured oocytes with a present polar body were snap frozen. Two pools of 10 immature and mature oocytes for both diapause and nondiapause stages were included (at least 4 donors/pool). Oocyte pools were processed using the Smart-seq 2 single-cell protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for full-length cDNA and library preparation. We performed RNA-seq on an Illumina sequencer. The obtained Fastq files were clipped and analysed with a locally installed version of the Galaxy platform. Sequences were mapped against the roe deer transcriptome (unpublished data) and annotated against human and bovine transcripts. Differentially expressed genes (DEG; false discovery rate <1%) were identified using EdgeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) in immature (IMM) and mature (M) oocytes from diapause (D) and nondiapause (ND) stages. Additionally, to evaluate the effects of maturation on oocyte transcript abundancy, DEG between IMM and M oocytes for D and ND were identified. Multidimensional scaling resulted in clustering according to oocyte types. Gene ontology terms for biological processes were assigned using ToppCluster tools. A total of 23â€‰066, 23â€‰022, 22â€‰438, and 22â€‰532 transcripts were detected for IMM D, M D, IMM ND and M ND oocytes, respectively. Using false discovery rate filtering, we found 333 and 288 DEG in immature and mature oocytes, respectively. Furthermore, maturation changed the oocyte expression profiles during D (2233 DEG) and ND periods (2589 DEG). Gene ontology classification revealed that most of the DEG in immature oocytes were involved in macromolecule catabolic process and oxidation-reduction process. For mature oocytes, DEG were mostly related to regulation of chromosome condensation and ER and Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. Additionally, the top 20 DEG from IMM D v. M D oocytes were related to mRNA splicing, mRNA metabolic process, and mRNA processing. These processes were not identified in the top 20 DEG from IMM ND v. M ND oocytes. These preliminary results suggest that oocyte transcriptome analysis could disclose new pathways implicated in oocyte competence and embryonic developmental arrest and activation stages.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Sandra Milena Bernal-Ulloa"", ids = ""1441369143""); list(name = ""Vera A. van der Weijden"", ids = ""72620663""); list(name = ""Jochen T.

caf27ed6305eda7001019cc146524691a0ed4bd0,177Lu-octreotate therapy for neuroendocrine tumours is enhanced by Hsp90 inhibition,"177Lu-octreotate is an FDA-approved radionuclide therapy for patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) expressing somatostatin receptors. The 177Lu-octreotate therapy has shown promising results in clinical trials by prolonging progression-free survival, but complete responses are still uncommon. The aim of this study was to improve the 177Lu-octreotate therapy by means of combination therapy. To identify radiosensitising inhibitors, two cell lines, GOT1 and P-STS, derived from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (SINETs), were screened with 1,224 inhibitors alone or in combination with external radiation. The screening revealed that inhibitors of Hsp90 can potentiate the tumour cell-killing effect of radiation in a synergistic fashion (GOT1; false discovery rate <3.2Ã—10-11). The potential for Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib to enhance the anti-tumour effect of 177Lu-octreotate in an in vivo setting was studied in the somatostatin receptor-expressing GOT1 xenograft model. The combination led to a larger decrease in tumour volume relative to monotherapies and the tumour-reducing effect was shown to be synergistic. Using patient-derived tumour cells from eight metastatic SINETs, we could show that ganetespib enhanced the effect of 177Lu-octreotate therapy for all investigated patient tumours. Levels of Hsp90 protein expression were evaluated in 767 SINETs from 379 patients. We found that Hsp90 expression was upregulated in tumour cells relative to tumour stroma in the vast majority of SINETs. We conclude that Hsp90 inhibitors enhance the tumour-killing effect of 177Lu-octreotate therapy synergistically in SINET tumour models and suggest that this potentially promising combination should be further evaluated.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tobias Hofving"", ids = ""4362882""); list(name = ""Viktor Sandblom"", ids = ""8762338""); list(name = ""Yvonne B.

056f6fe089df6ba2bc7f5437269eca591f9708ba,Multilevel thresholding and fractal analysis based approach for classification of brain MRI images into tumour and non-tumour,"In this paper, a method is proposed for classification of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images as tumour and non-tumour. A multilevel thresholding is used for segmentation. Thresholding is applied to convert MRI images to binary images. Fractal texture analysis is carried out for texture feature extraction. Mean and area features are extracted from binary images. We have computed fractal dimension (FD) using box counting method. The fractal measurements describe the boundary complexity of objects and structures beings segmented. Three features extracted, namely, mean, area and FD are used for classification. The images are classified as tumour or non-tumour using artificial neural network (ANN). The experiments are carried out on coronal, sagittal and axial views of brain MRI images. We have used the different number of thresholds (t) in the range [0-10]. We have found that the required value of t is three. Eight different parameters viz. specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, false positive rate (FPR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false discovery rate (FDR), F-SCORE for optimum number of thresholds are evaluated. We have obtained 100% classification accuracy for all the views of brain MRI images.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Basavaraj S.

dcd1753a8bd236106974c9bbdb7ecc976ccf284f,LDM Package,"The LDM package implements the Linear Decomposition Model (Hu and Satten 2019), which provides a single analysis path that includes global tests of any effect of the microbiome, tests of the effects of individual OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) while accounting for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and a connection to distance-based ordination. It accommodates multiple covariates (e.g., clinical outcomes, environmental factors, treatment groups), either continuous or discrete (with â‰¥ 2 levels), as well as interaction terms to be tested either singly or in combination, allows for adjustment of confounding covariates, and uses permutation-based p-values that can control for clustered data (e.g., repeated measurements on the same individual). It gives results for both the frequency and arcsine-root-transformed data, and can give an â€œomnibusâ€ test that combines results from analyses conducted on the two scales. The core function of the LDM package is ldm, which can be used to test association between covariates of interest and the microbiome, possibly after adjusting for confounding covariates. Several additional functions are included in the LDM package. The function permanovaFL implements the PERMANOVA-FL test (our version of the PERMANOVA test); unlike the implementation of PERMANOVA in adonis and adonis2 in the R package vegan, permanovaFL adopts the permutation scheme described by Freedman and Lane (1983). The function adjust.data.by.covariates produces the adjusted distance matrix and OTU table after removing the effects of covariates (e.g., confounders). The function ldm uses two sequential stopping criteria. For the global test, LDM uses the stopping rule of Besag and Clifford (1991), which stops permutation when a pre-specified minimum number (default = 20) of rejections (i.e., the permutation statistic exceeded the observed test statistic) has been reached. For the OTU-specific tests, LDM uses the stopping rule of Sandve et al. (2011), which stops permutation when every OTU test has either reached the pre-specified number (default = 20) of rejections or yielded a q-value that is below the nominal FDR level (default = 0.1). As a convention, we call a test â€œstoppedâ€ if the corresponding stopping criterion for that test has been satisfied. All tests are terminated when a user-specified maximum number of permutations have been generated; if this number is â€œtoo",2019,,"list(name = ""Yi-Juan Hu"", ids = ""7741363"")",,688462593e334c09cc56f91f1e246897787b71d9; 639994438c2c5cbbf2ecb89bacd1faae565625e6; 8a152bd2e5d4dafb5a1f1131890415016bc969e2; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c,,,
db89c9ed8d62581aac8c322c71599b36bad2f69c,Evaluation of Target Preparation Methods for Single-Feature Polymorphism Detection in Large Complex Plant Genomes,"For those genomes low in repetitive DNA, hybridizing total genomic DNA to high-density expression arrays offers an effective strategy for scoring singlefeature polymorphisms (SFPs). Of the ~2.5 gigabases that constitute the maize (Zea mays L.) genome, only 10 to 20% are genic sequences, with large amounts of repetitive DNA intermixed throughout. Therefore, a target preparation method engineered to generate a high genicâ€“toâ€“repetitive DNA ratio is essential for SFP detection in maize. To that end, we tested four gene enrichment and complexity reduction target preparation methods for scoring SFPs on the Affymetrix GeneChip Maize Genome Array (â€œMaize GeneChipâ€). Methylation fi ltration (MF), Cot fi ltration (CF), mRNA-derived cRNA, and amplifi ed fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methods were applied to three diverse maize inbred lines (B73, Mo17, and CML69) with three replications per line (36 Maize GeneChips). Our results indicate that these particular target preparation methods offer only modest power to detect SFPs with the Maize GeneChip. Most notably, CF and MF are comparable in power, detecting more than 10 000 SFPs at a 20% false discovery rate. Although reducing sample complexity to ~125 megabase by AFLP improves SFP scoring accuracy over other methods, only a minimal number of SFPs are still detected. Our fi ndings of residual repetitive DNA in labeled targets and other experimental errors call for improved gene-enrichment methods and custom array designs to more accurately array genotype large, complex crop genomes. Modern cultivated maize (Zea mays L.) boasts more genetic diversity than any other domesticated grass, retaining on average more than two-thirds of the nucleotide diversity of its wild relatives (Gaut et al., 2000; Tenaillon et al., 2001; White and Doebley, 1999). Indeed, DNA sequences of any two maize inbred lines diff er from one another at an estimated frequency of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) per 70 bases (silent sites) (Tenaillon et al., 2001). Considering such high levels of nucleotide diversity and a genome roughly equivalent in magnitude to the human genome (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991), this yields about 30 million segregating sites. Intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) rates decline to minimal levels within two kilobases (kb) for a genetically diverse sample of tropical and temperate maize inbred lines (Remington et al., 2001). Due to this rapid breakdown of LD in a highly variable genome, an estimated one M.

0b638ccc3a91f116d9b9de15ef6f9d02532b9338,"From milk to cheese: genomic background, biological pathways and latent phenotypes of bovine cheese-related traits","The aim of this PhD thesis was the study of the genomic, biological and phenotypic background of bovine cheese-related traits. The primary goal of this PhD thesis was to unravel the genomic background of bovine milk technological and cheese-related traits to specific chromosomic regions (CHAPTERS 1 to 3). To achieve this, the cowâ€™s ability to produce cheese was decomposed into 11 milk coagulation (MCP) and curd-firming properties (CFt), and 7 cheese yield and milk component recoveries into the curd (REC) traits. Besides, to tackle the problem of the large number of variables required to describe the cowâ€™s ability to produce cheese, posing restrictions in the construction of selection indices, and thereby selection decisions, factor analysis (FA) was used (CHAPTERS 4 and 5). 
The MCP traits were: 3 traditional single point lacto-dynamographic properties (RCT: rennet coagulation time, min; k20: time to a curd firmness (CF) of 20 mm, min; a30: CF 30 min after rennet addition), 6 parameters modeling 360 CF data for each milk sample (CFP: potential asymptotic CF at infinite time, mm; kCF: curd firming instant rate constant, %Ã—min-1; kSR: syneresis instant rate constant, %Ã—min-1; RCTeq: RCT from modeling; CFmax: maximum CF, mm; tmax: time at CFmax, min), milk- protein (%) and pH. The 3 CY traits were the weight (wt) of fresh curd (%CYCURD), curd solids (%CYSOLIDS), and curd moisture (%CYWATER) as % of wt of milk processed. The 4 REC (RECFAT, RECPROTEIN, RECSOLIDS, and RECENERGY) were calculated as the % ratio between the nutrient in curd and the corresponding nutrient in processed milk. For FA 26 traits related to milk yield and quality (including milk protein fractions), MCP-CFt and CY-REC traits were analyzed. 
Single marker genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) complemented by gene-set enrichment and pathway-based analyses were conducted. In total, 1,152 Italian Brown Swiss cows reared in 85 herds were genotyped with the Illumina SNP50 Beadchip v.2. Single marker regression GWAS were fitted using the GenABEL R package (GRAMMAR-GC). The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases were queried for the enrichment analyses. 
In GWAS (CHAPTERS 1 and 2), sharp peaks were detected on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 6, at 84 to 88 Mbp, with the highest peak detected at 87.4 Mbp in the region harboring the casein genes and more precisely of Îº-CN (CSN3). Marker Hapmap52348-rs29024684 (~87.4 Mbp), closely located to the casein genes on BTA6, was strongly associated with RECFAT (P = 1.91Ã—10-15) and CFP (P = 1.62Ã—10-17). Evidence of quantitative trait loci at 82.6 and 88.4 Mbp on the same chromosome was found. On BTA11, marker ARS-BFGL-NGS-104610 (~104.3 Mbp) was highly associated with RECPROTEIN (P = 6.07Ã—10-36). Apart from BTA6 and 11, SNP located in 15 more chromosomes (1, 2, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, 27 and 28) were significantly associated to the MCP-CFt and CY-REC traits. 
The gene-set enrichment and pathway-based analysis (CHAPTER 3) revealed 21 GO and 17 KEGG categories significantly associated (false discovery rate controlled at 5%) with 7 of the traits (RCT, RCTeq, kCF, %CYSOLIDS, RECFAT, RECSOLIDS and RECENERGY), with some being in common between traits. The significantly enriched categories included calcium signaling pathway, salivary secretion, metabolic pathways, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, the tight junction and the phosphatidylinositol pathways, as well as pathways related to the bovine mammary gland health status, and contained a total of 150 genes located in all chromosomes but 9, 20, and 27. 
In FA (CHAPTERS 4 and 5), ten mutual orthogonal Fs were obtained using a varimax rotation. The 10 Fs explaining 74% of the original variability. Those Fs captured basic concepts of the â€œmilk to cheeseâ€ process. More precisely, the first four Fs, sorted by variance explained, were able to capture the underlying structure of the CY percentage (F1%CY), the CF process with time (F2CFt), the milk and solids yield (F3Yield) and the presence of nitrogen (N) into the cheese (F4Cheese N). Moreover, 4 Fs (F5 Î±s1-Î²-CN, F7Î²-Îº-CN, F8Î±s2-CN, F9Î±s1-CN-P) were related to the basic milk caseins (as1-CN, as2-CN, Î²-CN, Îº-CN, and the phosphorylated form of as1-CN) and 1 factor was associated with the Î±-LA whey protein (F10Î±-LA). A factor describing the udder health status of a cow (F6Udder health), mainly loaded on lactose, other nitrogen compounds and SCS, was also obtained. 
In general, FA results were coherent to the given name of the factor. Stage of lactation had a significant effect for the majority of the Fs, followed by parity. Moreover, considerable genetic correlations existed among the Fs (CHAPTER 4). All Fs showed significant associations (P < 5 Ã—10-5) in GWAS, but F5Yield. High peaks on BTA6 (~87Mbp) and at the tail of BTA11 (~104Mbp) were mainly associated to F6Î²-Îº-CN and F1Cheese N, respectively. In addition, 33 GO terms and 6 KEGG categories were mainly enriched for F8Î±s2-CN, but also for F1%CY, F4Cheese N, and F10Î±-LA. Biological pathways were mainly related to the broader categories of ion activity, neurons and the tight junction. Moreover, the considerably large number of enriched GO and KEGG terms for F8Î±s2-CN suggests that, perhaps, more focus should be given on Î±s2-CN (CHAPTER 5).",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Christos Dadousis"", ids = ""4133338"")",,,,,

Human endometrium harbors a small population of perivascular, clonogenic MSCs (eMSCs) identified by the SUSD2 marker. As for other MSCs, eMSCs require extensive in vitro expansion to generate clinically relevant numbers of cells, resulting in spontaneous differentiation, replicative senescence and cell death, decreasing therapeutic potency. We previously demonstrated that A83-01, a TGF-Î² receptor inhibitor, maintained eMSC clonogenicity, promoted proliferation, prevented apoptosis and maintained MSC function in vitro. Here we compare the transcriptome of passaged eMSCs from six women cultured with and without A83-01 for 7 days. We identified 1206 differentially expressed genes (DEG) using a false discovery rate cut-off at 0.01 and fold change >2. Significant enrichment of genes involved in anti-inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, cell migration and proliferation, and collagen fibril and extracellular matrix organization were revealed. TGF-Î², Wnt and Akt signaling pathways were decreased. Anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic genes were induced, and fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast related genes were downregulated. We found increased MSC potency genes (TWIST1, TWIST2, JAG1, LIFR, and SLIT2) validating the enhanced potency of A83-01-treated eMSCs, and importantly no pluripotency gene expression. We also identified eMSCs' potential for secreting exosomes, possibly explaining their paracrine properties. Angiogenic and cytokine protein arrays confirmed the angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory phenotype of A83-01-treated eMSCs, and increased angiogenic activity was functionally demonstrated in vitro. eMSCs culture expanded with A83-01 have enhanced clinically relevant properties, suggesting their potential for cell-therapies and regenerative medicine applications.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shanti Gurung"", ids = ""48024844""); list(name = ""Sarah Williams"", ids = ""48392694""); list(name = ""James A Deane"", ids = ""2032306""); list(name = ""Jerome Anthony Werkmeister"", ids = ""4829295""); list(name = ""Caroline E.

375220cb2375efc3341a4eaad5cb32745f9cab4b,Abstract 3222: Evaluation of associations between circulating proteins and breast cancer risk using genetic variants,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in many countries. Several circulating protein biomarkers have been identified in relation to breast cancer risk. However, previous studies either had small sample sizes or employed low-throughput techniques. To search for novel biomarkers, we utilized genetic variants as instruments and evaluated over 1,400 proteins in relation to breast cancer risk using data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). We extracted beta coefficients from reported protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) derived from genome-wide association studies of circulating proteins. Summary statistics of these pQTL variants associated with breast cancer risk were obtained from 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European descent in the BCAC. Associations of genetically predicted protein levels with breast cancer risk were evaluated using the inverse-variance weighted method. For proteins with a significant association, expression levels of the corresponding gene were predicted using genotyping and transcriptomic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and then evaluated for their associations with breast cancer risk. We identified 56 protein biomarkers showing a significant association with breast cancer risk after accounting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate -4 to 3.28x10 -8 ). Genetically predicted expression of five genes, CPNE1, CTSF, TFPI, SCG3, and QSOX2, was found to be associated with breast cancer risk at p Citation Format: Xiang Shu, Jiandong Bao, Lang Wu, Jirong Long, Xingyi Guo, Kyriaki Michailidou, Manjeet K.

8126e711a95b699f8cd349920ee2b36f74c741e0,Integrating pathway analysis and genetics of gene expression for genome-wide association study of basal cell carcinoma,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have primarily focused on marginal effects for individual markers and have incorporated external functional information only after identifying robust statistical associations. We applied a new approach combining the genetics of gene expression and functional classification of genes to the GWAS of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) to identify potential biological pathways associated with BCC. We first identified 322,324 expression-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs) from two existing GWASs of global gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (nÂ =Â 955), and evaluated the association of these functionally annotated SNPs with BCC among 2,045 BCC cases and 6,013 controls in Caucasians. We then grouped them into 99 KEGG pathways for pathway analysis and identified two pathways associated with BCC with p value <0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR) <0.5: the autoimmune thyroid disease pathway (mainly HLA class I and II antigens, pÂ <Â 0.001, FDRÂ =Â 0.24) and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway (pÂ =Â 0.02, FDRÂ =Â 0.49). Seventy-nine (25.7%) out of 307 significant eSNPs in the JAK-STAT pathway were associated with BCC risk (pÂ <Â 0.05) in an independent replication set of 278 BCC cases and 1,262 controls. In addition, the association of JAK-STAT signaling pathway was marginally validated using 16,691 eSNPs identified from 110 normal skin samples (pÂ =Â 0.08). Based on the evidence of biological functions of the JAK-STAT pathway on oncogenesis, it is plausible that this pathway is involved in BCC pathogenesis.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Mingfeng Zhang"", ids = ""38135432""); list(name = ""Liming Liang"", ids = ""3039333""); list(name = ""Nilesh Morar"", ids = ""48590000""); list(name = ""Anna L.

357b1c6176a87f0dd22c7119f7f8c5f523ee4dde,Role of Esrrg in the fibrate-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism genes in human ApoA-I transgenic mice,"We have used a new ApoA-I transgenic mouse model to identify by global gene expression profiling, candidate genes that affect lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in response to fenofibrate treatment. Multilevel bioinformatical analysis and stringent selection criteria (2-fold change, 0% false discovery rate) identified 267 significantly changed genes involved in several molecular pathways. The fenofibrate-treated group did not have significantly altered levels of hepatic human APOA-I mRNA and plasma ApoA-I compared with the control group. However, the treatment increased cholesterol levels to 1.95-fold mainly due to the increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The observed changes in HDL are associated with the upregulation of genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and lipid hydrolysis, as well as phospholipid transfer protein. Significant upregulation was observed in genes involved in fatty acid transport and Î²-oxidation, but not in those of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis, Krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis. Fenofibrate changed significantly the expression of seven transcription factors. The estrogen receptor-related gamma gene was upregulated 2.36-fold and had a significant positive correlation with genes of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and mitochondrial functions, indicating an important role of this orphan receptor in mediating the fenofibrate-induced activation of a specific subset of its target genes.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Despina Sanoudou"", ids = ""2443411""); list(name = ""Adelina Duka"", ids = ""26856926""); list(name = ""Konstantinos Drosatos"", ids = ""5892743""); list(name = ""Kenneth C.

76fb84b2ff422d645782f5a7231c869aac29c7df,Stage-dependent loss of cortical gyrification as Parkinson disease â€œunfoldsâ€,"Objective:Nigrostriatal terminal losses are known to progress most rapidly in early-stage Parkinson disease (PD) and then plateau, whereas cortical pathology continues and may provide a better marker of PD progression in later stages. We investigated cortical gyrification indices in patients with different durations of PD, since cortical folding may capture complex processes involving transverse forces of neuronal sheets or underlying axonal connectivity. Methods:Longitudinal cohort structural MRI were obtained at baseline, 18 months, and 36 months from 70 patients with PD without dementia and 70 control participants. Cortical local gyrification index (LGI) was compared between controls and PD subgroups based upon duration of illness (DOI, <1 year [PDE, n = 17], 1â€“5 years [PDM, n = 19], >5 years [PDL, n = 24]) and adjusted using false discovery rate. Associations between LGI and clinical measurements were assessed using multiple linear regression. Areas having significantly reduced LGI also were analyzed using baseline data from a newly established cohort (PD n = 87, control n = 66) to validate our findings. Results:In the longitudinal cohort, PDL had significantly reduced overall gyrification, and bilaterally in the inferior parietal, postcentral, precentral, superior frontal, and supramarginal areas, compared to controls (p < 0.05). Longitudinally, loss of gyrification was accelerated in PDM participants, compared to controls. LGI showed robust correlations with DOI and also was correlated with PD-related clinical measurements. Similar results were obtained in the validation sample.

38636c1f2f1e376f7fdba579e8ad9934cc022b31,The role of a single olfactory receptor in odorant perception: relating receptor space to perceptual space,"Although odorant identity is encoded by the activation patterns of olfactory receptors, we do not know how alterations in receptor activation affect the perceptual properties of an odorant. Human beings display considerable variation in odor perception, very little of which has been concretely linked to molecular causes. Here, we take advantage of genetic variations that affect human odorant receptor function to study the resulting alterations in olfactory perception. Based on previous studies demonstrating that amino acid alterations in OR7D4 affect perception of the odorant androstenone, we hypothesized that subjects with a nonfunctional odorant receptor allele will display varied perception of the receptorâ€™s ligand, specifically a reduction in intensity and an increase in valence, in comparison to subjects with functional alleles. To address this issue, we asked 321 human subjects to rate the intensity and valence of 68 odors. We then developed a protocol to sequence each subjectâ€™s OR subgenome with high coverage. In a genotype/phenotype association analysis, we identified 27 polymorphisms in 8 distinct gene clusters that are associated with alterations in odorant perception more strongly than the association of the OR7D4 R88W variant with androstenone intensity in the same data set. Additionally, 35 polymorphisms fall above the 5% false discovery rate cutoff calculated by permutation analysis. These polymorphisms are found in 11 distinct olfactory receptor gene clusters, but extensive linkage disequilibrium precludes the identification of a single causal receptor. To address this problem, we generated clones of all major receptor variants found in a cluster on chromosome 11 containing 8 odorant receptor genes. These variants were subsequently tested in a high-throughput luciferase assay optimized for the study of olfactory receptor activation. We found that an OR10G4 allele associated with a significant decrease in the perceived intensity of guaiacol, A9V/M134V/V195E/R235G/K265Q, displayed a greatly reduced ability to respond to this odorant in vitro, suggesting a mechanistic basis for the genotype/phenotype association and linking perceptual variation to alterations in receptor function. This work suggests that despite the combinatorial nature of the olfactory code, alterations in a single odorant receptor can have a significant effect on odor perception and is a first step toward the development of a model relating receptor activation and odor perception.",2014,Psychology,"list(name = ""Casey Trimmer"", ids = ""13820215""); list(name = ""JR Willer"", ids = ""144069849""); list(name = ""Nicholas Katsanis"", ids = ""6055137""); list(name = ""Hiroaki Matsunami"", ids = ""6188239""); list(name = ""JD Mainland"", ids = ""35438886"")",,,Flavour,3,1

c1e8110f9947c604786608f168fb1db4e42995e7,Ruminant Nutrition Symposium: Metabolomics Applications in Dairy Cow Metabolism,"An overview is given on mass spectrometry-based metabolomics: past, current, and future developments. Understanding the metabolome is challenging due to the enormous diversity of metabolite structures. Metabolomics uses a range of tools, established as service at the NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis. We here explore the use of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) in combination with liquid chromatography (LC) and high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) for milk analysis by increasing total peak capacity, specifically to distinguish isobaric and isomeric species that are not resolved by LC-MS alone. As example, we used LC-IM-QTOF MS for unraveling the complex lipidome compositions in human, goat and cow milk. Measurements were performed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC with 6560 drift tube-ion mobility-QTOF MS system using a Waters Acquity CSH C18 column with a 15 min-gradient of isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10, B) varied from 15% to 99% and acetonitrile:water (60:40, A), ammonium formate/ formic acid buffered. Twenty Î¼L of milk samples were extracted with MTBE and methanol. Dried extracts were reconstituted in methanol before LC-IM-MS analysis. Measured ion mobility drift times were corrected with external calibration for time spent outside the drift tube for precise determination of collision cross sections. We optimized the control over ion trapping in the drift cell. We analyzed lipid extract from 3 types of milk samples with untargeted LC-IM-MS. IM mode provided 6x more molecular features compared with regular LC-MS analysis without ion mobility. Using Agilent Mass Profiler to report IM peak feature, we developed a specific command line tool in R to characterize co-eluting isobaric species, followed by downstream identification by MS-DIAL. Our R command screened the IM features that exhibited distinct IM drift time (e.g., ?DT > 0.4 msec) by approximate m/z and LC retention time. We reduced the false discovery rate by evaluating DT intensities and m/z-specific DT after fitting a power-law regression. We discovered 73 isobaric species in milk lipidomic extracts that required ion mobility separation in addition to LC-QTOF MS.",2017,,"list(name = ""Fozia Saleem"", ids = ""4460192""); list(name = ""Qendrim Zebeli"", ids = ""4085764""); list(name = ""Burim Ametaj"", ids = ""4268861""); list(name = ""Nick Psychogios"", ids = ""2722839""); list(name = ""Michael Lewis"", ids = ""145826008""); list(name = ""Suzanna M.

Mice were treated with PME and saline or untreated once daily for 5 days, followed by alcohol injection. The plasma samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based high-resolution metabolomics followed by a multivariate statistical analysis using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 to obtain significantly expressed metabolites, using a false discovery rate threshold of qâ€‰=â€‰0.05. Metabolites were annotated using Metlin database and mapped through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Among 4999 total features, 101 features were significant among alcohol- and PME-treated mice groups. All the samples cluster showed a clear separation in the heat map, and the scores plot of orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model discriminated the three groups. Phosphatidylcholine, Saikosaponin BK1, Ganoderiol I, and N-2-[4-(3,3-dimethylallyloxy) phenyl] ethylcinnamide were among the significant compounds with a low intensity in alcohol group compared to PME group, suggesting that these compounds have a relation in the development of PME's protective effect.

4de91ae462b9106e779a52ff0514f0b060702326,Detection of significantly differentially methylated regions in targeted bisulfite sequencing data,"MOTIVATION
Bisulfite sequencing is currently the gold standard to obtain genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in eukaryotes. In contrast to the rapid development of appropriate pre-processing and alignment software, methods for analyzing the resulting methylation profiles are relatively limited so far. For instance, an appropriate pipeline to detect DNA methylation differences between cancer and control samples is still required.


RESULTS
We propose an algorithm that detects significantly differentially methylated regions in data obtained by targeted bisulfite sequencing approaches, such as reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In a first step, this approach tests all target regions for methylation differences by taking spatial dependence into account. A false discovery rate procedure controls the expected proportion of incorrectly rejected regions. In a second step, the significant target regions are trimmed to the actually differentially methylated regions. This hierarchical procedure detects differentially methylated regions with increased power compared with existing methods.

fa57afecf9fca50862d98dd70fb8f89204e8d49f,Permutation and parametric tests for effect sizes in voxel-based morphometry of gray matter volume in brain structural MRI.,"Permutation testing has been widely implemented in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) tools. However, this type of non-parametric inference has yet to be thoroughly compared with traditional parametric inference in VBM studies of brain structure. Here we compare both types of inference and investigate what influence the number of permutations in permutation testing has on results in an exemplar study of how gray matter proportion changes with age in a group of working age adults. High resolution T1-weighted volume scans were acquired from 80 healthy adults aged 25-64years. Using a validated VBM procedure and voxel-based permutation testing for Pearson product-moment coefficient, the effect sizes of changes in gray matter proportion with age were assessed using traditional parametric and permutation testing inference with 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 permutations. The statistical significance was set at P<0.05 and false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Clusters of voxels with statistically significant (PFDR<0.05) declines in gray matter proportion with age identified with permutation testing inference (Nâ‰ˆ6000) were approximately twice the size of those identified with parametric inference (N=3221voxels). Permutation testing with 10000 (N=6251voxels) and 20000 (N=6233voxels) permutations produced clusters that were generally consistent with each other. However, with 1000 permutations there were approximately 20% more statistically significant voxels (N=7117voxels) than with â‰¥10000 permutations. Permutation testing inference may provide a more sensitive method than traditional parametric inference for identifying age-related differences in gray matter proportion. Based on the results reported here, at least 10000 permutations should be used in future univariate VBM studies investigating age related changes in gray matter to avoid potential false findings. Additional studies using permutation testing in large imaging databanks are required to address the impact of model complexity, multivariate analysis, number of observations, sampling bias and data quality on the accuracy with which subtle differences in brain structure associated with normal aging can be identified.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""David Alexander Dickie"", ids = ""39130150""); list(name = ""Shadia S Mikhael"", ids = ""5989745""); list(name = ""Dominic Edward Job"", ids = ""3355605""); list(name = ""Joanna M.

eadeebc8ffe91fd6c026d3399d61eb8b691d1e2a,Metabolomic Analysis of Liver Tissue from the VX2 Rabbit Model of Secondary Liver Tumors,"Purpose. The incidence of liver neoplasms is rising in USA. The purpose of this study was to determine metabolic profiles of liver tissue during early cancer development. Methods. We used the rabbit VX2 model of liver tumors (LT) and a control group consisting of sham animals implanted with Gelfoam into their livers (LG). After two weeks from implantation, liver tissue from lobes with and without tumor was obtained from experimental animals (LT+/LT-) as well as liver tissue from controls (LG+/LG-). Peaks obtained by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry were subjected to identification. 56 metabolites were identified and their profiles compared between groups using principal component analysis (PCA) and a mixed-effect two-way ANOVA model. Results. Animals recovered from surgery uneventfully. Analyses identified a metabolite profile that significantly differs in experimental conditions after controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). 16 metabolites concentrations differed significantly when comparing samples from (LT+/LT-) to samples from (LG+/LG-) livers. A significant difference was also shown in 20 metabolites when comparing samples from (LT+) liver lobes to samples from (LT-) liver lobes. Conclusion. Normal liver tissue harboring malignancy had a distinct metabolic signature. The role of metabolic profiles on liver biopsies for the detection of early liver cancer remains to be determined.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rafael A.

170790057cf8463c9661667ca6646122941ed4d8,Angiogenic and Immunologic Proteins Identified by Deep Proteomic Profiling of Human Retinal and Choroidal Vascular Endothelial Cells: Potential Targets for New Biologic Drugs.,"PURPOSE
Diseases that involve retinal or choroidal vascular endothelial cells are leading causes of vision loss: age-related macular degeneration, retinal ischemic vasculopathies, and noninfectious posterior uveitis. Proteins differentially expressed by these endothelial cell populations are potential drug targets. We used deep proteomic profiling to define the molecular phenotype of human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells at the protein level.


METHODS
Retinal and choroidal vascular endothelial cells were separately isolated from 5 human eye pairs by selection on CD31. Total protein was extracted and digested, and peptide fractions were analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide sequences were assigned to fragment ion spectra, and proteins were inferred from openly accessible protein databases. Protein abundance was determined by spectral counting. Publicly available software packages were used to identify proteins that were differentially expressed between human retinal and choroidal endothelial cells, and to classify proteins that were highly abundant in each endothelial cell population.


RESULTS
Human retinal and/or choroidal vascular endothelial cells expressed 5042 nonredundant proteins. Setting the differential expression false discovery rate at 0.05, 498 proteins of 3454 quantifiable proteins (14.4%) with minimum mean spectral counts of 2.5 were differentially abundant in the 2 cell populations. Retinal and choroidal endothelial cells were enriched in angiogenic proteins, and retinal endothelial cells were also enriched in immunologic proteins.


CONCLUSIONS
This work describes the different protein expression profiles of human retinal and choroidal vascular endothelial cells, and provides multiple candidates for further study as novel treatments or drug targets for posterior eye diseases.

afabb7ee147d553d04fd5e2f8b3ffae062394454,Metabolomic distinction and insights into the pathogenesis of human primary dilated cardiomyopathy.,"BACKGROUND
Metabolomics, the comprehensive profile of small-molecule metabolites found in biological specimens, has the potential to provide insights into the pathogenesis of disease states and lead to the identification of new biomarkers.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We analysed 451 plasma metabolites by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy in 39 patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 31 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched controls. Sixty-one metabolites were significantly different between primary DCM and control individuals [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0Â·05]. Plasma levels of steroid metabolites, glutamine, threonine and histidine were reduced while levels of citric acid cycle intermediates and lipid Î²-oxidation products were increased in patients with primary DCM when compared to controls. Medications, particularly furosemide and angiotensin-1 converting enzyme-1 inhibitors, had significant effects on the plasma metabolites. Reduced levels of glutamine in conjunction with increased 3-methyhistidine and prolylhydroxyproline levels suggested enhanced myofibrillar and collagen degradation in DCM patients. Likewise, increased stachydrine and reduced indole-3-propionate implicated a role for intestinal-derived antioxidant molecules. Changes in steroid metabolites were notable for the loss of metabolic distinction between men and women in patients with primary DCM. Cortisol and cortisone levels were increased while androgen metabolites were decreased significantly, implying metabolic 'feminization' of men with primary DCM.


CONCLUSIONS
Metabolomic profiling identifies biologically active metabolites that could serve as markers of primary DCM and impart protective or harmful effects on cardiac structure and function.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Danny C.

Schizophrenia has been associated with changes in both cortical thickness and surface area, but antipsychotic exposure, illness progression and substance use may confound observations. In antipsychotic-naÃ¯ve schizophrenia patients, we investigated cortical thickness and surface area as well as mean curvature before and after monotherapy with amisulpride, a relatively selective dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist.


METHODS
Fifty-six patients and 59 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent T1-weighted 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Forty-one patients and 51 HCs were re-scanned. FreeSurfer-processed baseline, follow-up values and symmetrized percentage changes (SPC) in cortical structures were analysed using univariate analysis of variance. Clinical measures comprised psychopathology ratings, assessment of functioning and tests of premorbid and current intelligence. We applied false discovery rate correction to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
At baseline, groups did not differ in cortical thickness or surface area; however, curvature in the left hemisphere was higher in patients (p = 0.015). In both patients and HCs, higher curvature was associated with lower premorbid (p = 0.009) and current intelligence (p 0.43). Cortical thickness SPC was negatively associated with symptom improvement (p = 0.002).


CONCLUSIONS
Schizophrenia appears associated with subtle, yet clinically relevant aberrations in cortical structures.

527ead87dc5e7fa00184acfe1534fb213271b786,Influence of multiple hypothesis testing on reproducibility in neuroimaging research: A simulation study and Python-based software,"BACKGROUND
Reproducibility of research findings has been recently questioned in many fields of science, including psychology and neurosciences. One factor influencing reproducibility is the simultaneous testing of multiple hypotheses, which entails false positive findings unless the analyzed p-values are carefully corrected. While this multiple testing problem is well known and studied, it continues to be both a theoretical and practical problem.


NEW METHOD
Here we assess reproducibility in simulated experiments in the context of multiple testing. We consider methods that control either thefamily-wise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR), including techniques based on random field theory (RFT), cluster-mass based permutation testing, and adaptive FDR. Severalclassical methods are also considered. The performance of these methods is investigated under two different models.


RESULTS
We found that permutation testing is the most powerful method among the considered approaches to multiple testing, and that grouping hypotheses based on prior knowledge can improve power. We also found that emphasizing primary and follow-up studies equally produced most reproducible outcomes.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S)
We have extended the use of two-group and separate-classes models for analyzing reproducibility and provide a new open-source software ""MultiPy"" for multiple hypothesis testing.


CONCLUSIONS
Our simulations suggest that performing strict corrections for multiple testing is not sufficient to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging experiments. The methods are freely available as a Python toolkit ""MultiPy"" and we aim this study to help in improving statistical data analysis practices and to assist in conducting power and reproducibility analyses for new experiments.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tuomas PuolivÃ¤li"", ids = ""3180364""); list(name = ""Satu Palva"", ids = ""144645178""); list(name = ""J Matias Palva"", ids = ""39189863"")",,,Journal of neuroscience methods,,"

An association between vitamin D deficiency and several autoimmune diseases has been suggested. We tested the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations and HLA alleles in pregnant Finnish women.Subjects/Methods:HLA-B (n=395), HLA-DRB1 (n=501) and HLA-DQB1 (n=475) alleles were genotyped in pregnant women (mothers of children who later developed type 1 diabetes and mothers of non-diabetic children). HLA-B alleles were divided into supertypes that share similar peptide-binding specificity. Serum 25OHD concentration had been previously measured in these women from sera collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Multiple testing was controlled for using the false discovery rate method.Results:An association was found between 25OHD concentration and HLA-B44 supertype (P=0.009); women with HLA-B44 supertype (B*18, B*37, B*40 and B*44 alleles) had lower 25OHD concentrations. No association was found between HLA-DRB1 or -DQB1 alleles and 25OHD concentration.Conclusions:In this study we found for the first time an association between HLA genetic polymorphisms and 25OHD concentration.

6becc5fa2d3e0bb06ea730cc6c25e73ea7fe227f,Increasing peptide identifications and decreasing search times for ETD spectra by pre-processing and calculation of parent precursor charge,"BackgroundElectron Transfer Dissociation [ETD] can dissociate multiply charged precursor polypeptides, providing extensive peptide backbone cleavage. ETD spectra contain charge reduced precursor peaks, usually of high intensity, and whose pattern is dependent on its parent precursor charge. These charge reduced precursor peaks and associated neutral loss peaks should be removed before these spectra are searched for peptide identifications. ETD spectra can also contain ion-types other than c and zË™. Modifying search strategies to accommodate these ion-types may aid in increased peptide identifications. Additionally, if the precursor mass is measured using a lower resolution instrument such as a linear ion trap, the charge of the precursor is often not known, reducing sensitivity and increasing search times. We implemented algorithms to remove these precursor peaks, accommodate new ion-types in noise filtering routine in OMSSA and to estimate any unknown precursor charge, using Linear Discriminant Analysis [LDA].ResultsSpectral pre-processing to remove precursor peaks and their associated neutral losses prior to protein sequence library searches resulted in a 9.8% increase in peptide identifications at a 1% False Discovery Rate [FDR] compared to previous OMSSA filter. Modifications to the OMSSA noise filter to accommodate various ion-types resulted in a further 4.2% increase in peptide identifications at 1% FDR. Moreover, ETD spectra when searched with charge states obtained from the precursor charge determination algorithm is shown to be up to 3.5 times faster than the general range search method, with a minor 3.8% increase in sensitivity.ConclusionOverall, there is an 18.8% increase in peptide identifications at 1% FDR by incorporating the new precursor filter, noise filter and by using the charge determination algorithm, when compared to previous versions of OMSSA.",2011,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""V.

Moreover, next generation sequencing approaches are more accurate in quantifying gene expression and can detect alternative splicing. Using RNA-seq, we examined whole-exome gene and exon expression in non-psychiatric controls (CON, N=29), DSM-IV major depressive disorder suicides (MDD-S, N=21) and MDD non-suicides (MDD, N=9) in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) of sudden death medication-free individuals post mortem. Using small RNA-seq, we also examined miRNA expression (nine samples per group). DeSeq2 identified 35 genes differentially expressed between groups and surviving adjustment for false discovery rate (adjusted P<0.1). In depression, altered genes include humanin-like-8 (MTRNRL8), interleukin-8 (IL8), and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade H (SERPINH1) and chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), while exploratory gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed lower expression of immune-related pathways such as chemokine receptor activity, chemotaxis and cytokine biosynthesis, and angiogenesis and vascular development in (adjusted P<0.1). Hypothesis-driven GO analysis suggests lower expression of genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission, and oxytocin receptor expression in both suicide and depression, and provisional evidence for altered DNA-dependent ATPase expression in suicide only. DEXSEq analysis identified differential exon usage in ATPase, class II, type 9B (adjusted P<0.1) in depression. Differences in miRNA expression or structural gene variants were not detected. Results lend further support for models in which deficits in microglial, endothelial (bloodâ€“brain barrier), ATPase activity and astrocytic cell functions contribute to MDD and suicide, and identify putative pathways and mechanisms for further study in these disorders.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Spiro P.

2bbd98012f6aee6dcd6fcdb00375334a33d1bc87,DNA methylation and body-mass index: a genome-wide analysis,"BACKGROUND
Obesity is a major health problem that is determined by interactions between lifestyle and environmental and genetic factors. Although associations between several genetic variants and body-mass index (BMI) have been identified, little is known about epigenetic changes related to BMI. We undertook a genome-wide analysis of methylation at CpG sites in relation to BMI.


METHODS
479 individuals of European origin recruited by the Cardiogenics Consortium formed our discovery cohort. We typed their whole-blood DNA with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. After quality control, methylation levels were tested for association with BMI. Methylation sites showing an association with BMI at a false discovery rate q value of 0Â·05 or less were taken forward for replication in a cohort of 339 unrelated white patients of northern European origin from the MARTHA cohort. Sites that remained significant in this primary replication cohort were tested in a second replication cohort of 1789 white patients of European origin from the KORA cohort. We examined whether methylation levels at identified sites also showed an association with BMI in DNA from adipose tissue (n=635) and skin (n=395) obtained from white female individuals participating in the MuTHER study. Finally, we examined the association of methylation at BMI-associated sites with genetic variants and with gene expression.


FINDINGS
20 individuals from the discovery cohort were excluded from analyses after quality-control checks, leaving 459 participants. After adjustment for covariates, we identified an association (q value â‰¤0Â·05) between methylation at five probes across three different genes and BMI. The associations with three of these probes--cg22891070, cg27146050, and cg16672562, all of which are in intron 1 of HIF3A--were confirmed in both the primary and second replication cohorts. For every 0Â·1 increase in methylation Î² value at cg22891070, BMI was 3Â·6% (95% CI 2Â·4-4Â·9) higher in the discovery cohort, 2Â·7% (1Â·2-4Â·2) higher in the primary replication cohort, and 0Â·8% (0Â·2-1Â·4) higher in the second replication cohort. For the MuTHER cohort, methylation at cg22891070 was associated with BMI in adipose tissue (p=1Â·72â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10(-5)) but not in skin (p=0Â·882). We observed a significant inverse correlation (p=0Â·005) between methylation at cg22891070 and expression of one HIF3A gene-expression probe in adipose tissue. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms--rs8102595 and rs3826795--had independent associations with methylation at cg22891070 in all cohorts. However, these single nucleotide polymorphisms were not significantly associated with BMI.


INTERPRETATION
Increased BMI in adults of European origin is associated with increased methylation at the HIF3A locus in blood cells and in adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that perturbation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor pathways could have an important role in the response to increased weight in people.

a9208dfeb27ef718c4acd42aba18532e63eeb4dc,Peppy: proteogenomic search software.,"Proteogenomic searching is a useful method for identifying novel proteins, annotating genes and detecting peptides unique to an individual genome. The approach, however, can be laborious, as it often requires search segmentation and the use of several unintegrated tools. Furthermore, many proteogenomic efforts have been limited to small genomes, as large genomes can prove impractical due to the required amount of computer memory and computation time. We present Peppy, a software tool designed to perform every necessary task of proteogenomic searches quickly, accurately and automatically. The software generates a peptide database from a genome, tracks peptide loci, matches peptides to MS/MS spectra and assigns confidence values to those matches. Peppy automatically performs a decoy database generation, search and analysis to return identifications at the desired false discovery rate threshold. Written in Java for cross-platform execution, the software is fully multithreaded for enhanced speed. The program can run on regular desktop computers, opening the doors of proteogenomic searching to a wider audience of proteomics and genomics researchers.

87015cdf3b5b64e5a6f9a33c4b8acc602565a817,Association between genetic polymorphisms and endometrial cancer risk: a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION
Endometrial cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women. Although there is a hereditary component to endometrial cancer, most cases are thought to be sporadic and lifestyle related. The aim of this study was to systematically review prospective and retrospective case-control studies, meta-analyses and genome-wide association studies to identify genomic variants that may be associated with endometrial cancer risk.


METHODS
We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL from 2007 to 2019 without restrictions. We followed PRISMA 2009 guidelines. The search yielded 3015 hits in total. Following duplicate exclusion, 2674 abstracts were screened and 453 full-texts evaluated based on our pre-defined screening criteria. 149 articles were eligible for inclusion.


RESULTS
We found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HNF1B, KLF, EIF2AK, CYP19A1, SOX4 and MYC were strongly associated with incident endometrial cancer. Nineteen variants were reported with genome-wide significance and a further five with suggestive significance. No convincing evidence was found for the widely studied MDM2 variant rs2279744. Publication bias and false discovery rates were noted throughout the literature.


CONCLUSION
Endometrial cancer risk may be influenced by SNPs in genes involved in cell survival, oestrogen metabolism and transcriptional control. Larger cohorts are needed to identify more variants with genome-wide significance.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cemsel Bafligil"", ids = ""1498060954""); list(name = ""Deborah J.

cdf7df70c61bc25de71cf5717095e51a291454ec,"Identification of nine genes as novel susceptibility loci for early-onset ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage","Given that substantial genetic components have been shown in ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), heritability may be higher in early-onset than late-onset individuals with these conditions. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified various genes and loci significantly associated with ischemic stroke, ICH, or intracranial aneurysm mainly in European ancestry populations, genetic variants that contribute to susceptibility to these disorders remain to be identified definitively. We performed exome-wide association studies (EWASs) to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke, ICH, or SAH in early-onset subjects with these conditions. A total of 6,649 individuals aged â‰¤65 years were examined. For the EWAS of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, 6,224 individuals (450 subjects with ischemic stroke, 5,774 controls) or 6,179 individuals (261 subjects with ICH, 176 subjects with SAH, 5,742 controls), respectively, were examined. EWASs were performed with the use of Illumina Human Exome-12 v1.2 DNA Analysis BeadChip or Infinium Exome-24 v1.0 BeadChip. To compensate for multiple comparisons of allele frequencies with ischemic stroke, ICH, or SAH, we applied a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05 for statistical significance of association. The association of allele frequencies of 31,245 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed quality control to ischemic stroke was examined with Fisher's exact test, and 31 SNPs were significantly (FDR <0.05) associated with ischemic stroke. The association of allele frequencies of 31,253 or 30,970 SNPs to ICH or SAH, respectively, was examined with Fisher's exact test, and six or two SNPs were significantly associated with ICH or SAH, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, and the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus revealed that 12 SNPs were significantly [P<0.0004 (0.05/124)] related to ischemic stroke. Similar analysis with adjustment for age, sex, and the prevalence of hypertension revealed that six or two SNPs were significantly [P<0.0016 (0.05/32)] related to ICH or SAH, respectively. After examination of linkage disequilibrium of identified SNPs and results of previous GWASs, we identified HHIPL2, CTNNA3, LOC643770, UTP20, and TRIB3 as susceptibility loci for ischemic stroke, DNTTIP2 and FAM205A as susceptibility loci for ICH, and FAM160A1 and OR52E4 as such loci for SAH. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, we have newly identified nine genes that confer susceptibility to early-onset ischemic stroke, ICH, or SAH.

ab8fe9f10ef64486aeb713d32c94b1e71500a6e6,Novel cytokine and chemokine markers of hidradenitis suppurativa reflect chronic inflammation and itch,"To the Editor, Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an autoâ€inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent, chronic painful and pruritic inflammatory nodules, abscesses and sinus tracts in predominantly the axillary, inguinal, and gluteal areas. A key element of the HS pathophysiology is occlusion of the follicular infundibulum and subsequent cyst formation, followed by rupture of the cyst inducing an intense inflammatory response. Accordingly, identification of inflammatory markers is important for the clinical stratification of HS and may help refining treatment choices. To date, no studies have investigated inflammatory protein levels in the serum/plasma and skin in parallel in a cohort of HS patients. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to simultaneously detect important cytokines and chemokines in, respectively, the plasma and lesional skin of patients with HS at a single time point. Blood and skin samples from 20 patients with a dermatologistâ€ verified diagnosis of HS and 10 healthy controls (Data S1) were prospectively collected in the Department of Dermatology of the Erasmus University Medical Center and Sint Franciscus Hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Skin samples of HS patients suffering of Hurley I to III disease severity were taken from actively inflamed, nonâ€fluctuating, indurated, erythematous lesions, or plaques recurring on fixed locations. The research protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (reference MECâ€2013â€337/NL45264.078.13). All participants provided written informed consent. Punch biopsies of 4 mm in diameter were obtained and immediately snapâ€frozen in liquid nitrogen. Venous blood was collected in vacuum EDTA tubes under sterile conditions, and after separation of the plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at âˆ’80Â°C until analysis. Samples were analyzed using the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Vâ€PLEX Human Cytokine 30â€plex kit (K15054D; Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions (Data S1). Moreover, three chemokines, which have not previously been reported to be overexpressed in HS patients, were additionally analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Data S1). Plasma protein concentrations were expressed as picogram (pg) per milliliter (mL), whereas skin protein levels were normalized for milligram (mg) tissue dry weight (pg/mg). In case, a protein level was below the detection limit, the lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) was used for further calculations. If more than 50% of the samples per analyzed protein in either the HS or the healthy control group had values below the LLOQ, values were substituted by two categories: detectable vs nonâ€detectable, that is above or below the LLOQ, respectively. For the primary objective, either the Mannâ€ Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test was used to assess the nullâ€ hypothesis that there was no difference in the levels of individual markers between control and HS samples. Secondly, correlations between protein levels of plasma and lesional HS skin were calculated (Data S1). Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics 24.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). A twoâ€sided P value below 0.05 was considered significant. This level was corrected by a false discovery rate using the Benjaminiâ€Hochberg test for multiple comparisons. In plasma, 20 of 30 (66.7%) analytes were detected. In the skin, 25 of 26 (96.2%) proteins were detected, while four proteins (ILâ€4, ILâ€7, VEGF, GMâ€CSF) were not analyzed because they have not been validated for skinâ€derived samples. In plasma, CCLâ€26 was detected significantly more often in HS patients (16 of 20) compared with healthy controls (2 of 10), P = 0.004 (Table 1). Accordingly, the median CCLâ€ 26 level in HS patients was 24.9 pg/mL, interquartile range 19.1âˆ’37.0 (Figure S1). In contrast, plasma CXCLâ€10 levels were significantly lower in HS patients, P = 0.003. In lesional skin, ILâ€16 (P < 0.001), ILâ€ 17A (P < 0.001), CXCLâ€8 (P = 0.001), plus ILâ€8 HA (P = 0.011), representing very high CXCLâ€8 concentrations, ILâ€12/23p40 (P = 0.007), CCLâ€4 (P = 0.011), CXCLâ€10 (P = 0.011) showed higher levels in HS patients compared with healthy controls (Table 2, Figure S2). The elevated CCLâ€4 and CXCLâ€10 protein levels in HS lesions were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figure S3). A strong staining of CCLâ€26 was observed in lesional skin, despite the fact that CCLâ€26 protein was not detected in lesional HS skin by the MSD assay (Table 2, Figure S3). Only weak correlations were observed between protein levels in HS plasma and lesional skin (Data S1, Table S1). Chemokine CCLâ€26 (also known as eotaxinâ€3) is a newly identified inflammatory marker in HS patients. Significant elevation of this chemokine in the serum has previously been reported in atopic dermatitis and cutaneous Tâ€cell lymphoma, which are characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, and specific subpopulations of T cells, and all, like HS, diseases characterized by high pruritus scores. Interestingly, CCLâ€26 was found in Abbreviations: CCL, C-C motif ligand; CRP, C-reactive protein; CXCL, C-X-C motif ligand; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor; HS, hidradenitis suppurativa; IL, interleukin; LLOQ, lowest limit of quantification; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Allard R J V Vossen"", ids = ""145824730""); list(name = ""H H van der Zee"", ids = ""7486424""); list(name = ""Lam C.

This paper introduces a parametric Bayesian analysis to determine the hypotheses to be considered as being significant (i.e., useful) for a posterior deeper analysis.

While posttraumatic anosmia is not uncommon, the olfactory function evaluation has strongly relied on subjective responses given by patients. We aimed to examine the utility of fMRI as an objective tool for diagnosing traumatic anosmia.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixteen patients (11 men and 5 women; mean age, 42.2 Â± 10.4 years) with clinically diagnosed traumatic anosmia and 19 healthy control subjects (11 men and 8 women; mean age, 29.3 Â± 8.5 years) underwent fMRI during olfactory stimulation with citral (a pleasant odor) or Î²-mercaptoethanol (an unpleasant odor). All patients were subjected to a clinical olfactory functional assessment and nasal endoscopic exploration. Two-sample t tests were conducted with age as a covariate to examine group differences in brain activation responses to olfactory stimulation (false discovery rate-corrected P < .05).


RESULTS
Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with traumatic anosmia had reduced activation in the bilateral primary and secondary olfactory cortices and the limbic system in response to Î²-mercaptoethanol stimulation, whereas reduced activation was observed only in the left frontal subgyral region in response to citral stimulation.


CONCLUSIONS
Brain activation was decreased in the bilateral primary and secondary olfactory cortices as well as the limbic system in response to olfactory stimulation in patients with traumatic anosmia compared with healthy control subjects. These preliminary results may shed light on the potential of fMRI for the diagnosis of traumatic anosmia.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""W-J Moon"", ids = ""153593927""); list(name = ""M Park"", ids = ""144120207""); list(name = ""Moon Jung Hwang"", ids = ""92573583""); list(name = ""J K Kim"", ids = ""13109670"")",aad027d095d178ab2b02ec57fac0a7db3990332b; 6d74e9bed019ab88ad8bfed2610227e2fc8d7fb9,,AJNR.

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CBCT) has contributed to an increase in TC survival rates over the last decades. However, cisplatin exposure has been shown to result in drug-induced DNA hypermethylation. The aim of the present study is to study the effects of CBCT on DNA methylation in cisplatin-treated vs untreated TC survivors. Material and methods We included 279 Norwegian TC survivors, where 103 underwent orchiectomy, and 176 orchiectomy and additional CBCT. The two groups were matched on age at blood sampling. The TC survivors were re-examined on average 16 years after the orchiectomy. Whole genome DNA methylation profiles were measured with Illumina`s MethylationEPIC BeadChip and analysed with the R package minfi. We used a linear regression model adjusting for smoking, age and cell type composition to identify CBCT differentially methylated CpG sites. Additionally, genes with p-value Results and discussions Out of the initial 866,836 CpG sites, 8â€‰62â€‰400 were included in our analysis. Thirty-three and 14 differentially methylated CpG sites were associated with CBCT after adjusting for multiple testing with False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Bonferroni correction, respectively. Eighty-five genes had a FDR adjusted p-value Conclusion Our results suggest that CBCT has long-term effects on the epigenome. Overall these results can contribute to elucidate what cellular mechanism are behind later consequences for TC survivors, like organotoxicity and metabolic syndrome. Our results should be further explored in a larger study of TC survivors treated with CBCT.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Cecilie Bucher-Johannessen"", ids = ""1422311075""); list(name = ""Christian Magnus Page"", ids = ""38891554""); list(name = ""T B Haugen"", ids = ""144004452""); list(name = ""Sd Fossaa"", ids = ""88074157""); list(name = ""Hege Sagstuen Haugnes"", ids = ""9776730""); list(name = ""Tom Grotmol"", ids = ""4245347""); list(name = ""Trine B.

To define the changes in gene expression following a blast injury to the eye, we examined retinal ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression in 54 mouse strains 5 days after a single 50-psi overpressure air wave blast injury. We observe that almost 40% of genes are differentially expressed with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.001, even though the nominal changes in RNA expression are rather small. Moreover, we find through machine learning approaches that genetic networks related to the innate and acquired immune system are activated. Accompanied by lymphocyte invasion into the inner retina, blast injury also results in progressive loss of visual function and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Collectively, these data demonstrate how systems genetics can be used to put meaning to the transcriptome changes following ocular blast injury that eventually lead to blindness.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Felix L.

079046c1d06c75e4abfb2dfd3091c6a54ce1e921,Microarray study of gene expression profiles in peripheral blood samples from lung cancer patients before and after erlotinib treatment.,"e19072 Background: The gene expression profile in peripheral blood samples from lung cancer patients is a potential predictor to treatment response.


METHODS
The study has been developed using 10 healthy volunteers as the control group and 10 lung cancer patients (stage IV). Written informed consent was obtained being the protocol approved by the local Clinical Research and Ethics Committee. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from lung cancer patients before (T0) and after treatment (T15d). RNA from peripheral blood samples was extracted and purified selecting 28S/18S ratios>1.5 to obtain cDNA and cRNA for hybridization of the 20,000 genes included in Human 20K CodeLink. An array from each participant was obtained in duplicate. For each array, 2 Î¼g of cRNA was compared to 2 Î¼g of healthy cRNA.. Significant genes were found using Significance Analysis of Microarrays which uses repeated permutations of the data.


RESULTS
The selected genes were expressed >3-fold with a false discovery rate =0.05. Before treatment (T0) when patients were compared to healthy volunteers there was an increase in the expression of: histone 1 H4c, transforming growth factor beta 2, endothelial cell growth factor 1 (platelet-derived), glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic 2, Relaxin 3 receptor 1, Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, RAS-like family 11 member B, and ELK4. After treatment (T15d), when each lung cancer patient's results were compared to their own before treatment results (T0), there was an increase in the expression of: Bcl2, myosin light polypeptide 4; interferon alpha-inducible protein 27; interferon gamma receptor 1; RASSF5, ARHGEF6, IGFBP5, tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 1, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma.


CONCLUSIONS
The data presented identifies biologically relevant over-expressed genes in lung cancer. A validation of these results and the analysis of the genes that identify patients who will respond positively to erlotinib treatment is being carried out.

e8f44803ee786ef88a9552579b310bb9f9390b18,Sex genes for genomic analysis in human brain: internal controls for comparison of probe level data extraction.,"BackgroundGenomic studies of complex tissues pose unique analytical challenges for assessment of data quality, performance of statistical methods used for data extraction, and detection of differentially expressed genes. Ideally, to assess the accuracy of gene expression analysis methods, one needs a set of genes which are known to be differentially expressed in the samples and which can be used as a ""gold standard"". We introduce the idea of using sex-chromosome genes as an alternative to spiked-in control genes or simulations for assessment of microarray data and analysis methods.ResultsExpression of sex-chromosome genes were used as true internal biological controls to compare alternate probe-level data extraction algorithms (Microarray Suite 5.0 [MAS5.0], Model Based Expression Index [MBEI] and Robust Multi-array Average [RMA]), to assess microarray data quality and to establish some statistical guidelines for analyzing large-scale gene expression. These approaches were implemented on a large new dataset of human brain samples. RMA-generated gene expression values were markedly less variable and more reliable than MAS5.0 and MBEI-derived values. A statistical technique controlling the false discovery rate was applied to adjust for multiple testing, as an alternative to the Bonferroni method, and showed no evidence of false negative results. Fourteen probesets, representing nine Y- and two X-chromosome linked genes, displayed significant sex differences in brain prefrontal cortex gene expression.ConclusionIn this study, we have demonstrated the use of sex genes as true biological internal controls for genomic analysis of complex tissues, and suggested analytical guidelines for testing alternate oligonucleotide microarray data extraction protocols and for adjusting multiple statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes. Our results also provided evidence for sex differences in gene expression in the brain prefrontal cortex, supporting the notion of a putative direct role of sex-chromosome genes in differentiation and maintenance of sexual dimorphism of the central nervous system. Importantly, these analytical approaches are applicable to all microarray studies that include male and female human or animal subjects.",2003,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hanga C.

1630661456773316fa21888962712a1f9f569722,JUM is a computational method for comprehensive annotation-free analysis of alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns.,"Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) greatly diversifies metazoan transcriptomes and proteomes and is crucial for gene regulation. Current computational analysis methods of AS from Illumina RNA-sequencing data rely on preannotated libraries of known spliced transcripts, which hinders AS analysis with poorly annotated genomes and can further mask unknown AS patterns. To address this critical bioinformatics problem, we developed a method called the junction usage model (JUM) that uses a bottom-up approach to identify, analyze, and quantitate global AS profiles without any prior transcriptome annotations. JUM accurately reports global AS changes in terms of the five conventional AS patterns and an additional ""composite"" category composed of inseparable combinations of conventional patterns. JUM stringently classifies the difficult and disease-relevant pattern of intron retention (IR), reducing the false positive rate of IR detection commonly seen in other annotation-based methods to near-negligible rates. When analyzing AS in RNA samples derived from Drosophila heads, human tumors, and human cell lines bearing cancer-associated splicing factor mutations, JUM consistently identified approximately twice the number of novel AS events missed by other methods. Computational simulations showed JUM exhibits a 1.2 to 4.8 times higher true positive rate at a fixed cutoff of 5% false discovery rate. In summary, JUM provides a framework and improved method that removes the necessity for transcriptome annotations and enables the detection, analysis, and quantification of AS patterns in complex metazoan transcriptomes with superior accuracy.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Qingqing Wang"", ids = ""19095874""); list(name = ""Donald C.

5c3f65660a3de5e5f9266edb1bae14f116aa07ae,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is Associated with the Immunoglobulin G N-Glycome through Putative Proinflammatory Mechanisms in an Australian Population.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common complex trait arising from interactions among multiple environmental, genomic, and postgenomic factors. We report here the first attempt to investigate the association between immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycan patterns, T2DM, and their clinical risk factors in an Australian population. N-glycosylation of proteins is one of the most frequently observed co- and post-translational modifications, reflecting, importantly, the real-time status of the interplay between the genomic and postgenomic factors. In a community-based case-control study, 849 participants (217 cases and 632 controls) were recruited from an urban community in Busselton, Western Australia. We applied the ultraperformance liquid chromatography method to analyze the composition of IgG N-glycans. We then conducted Spearman's correlation analyses to explore the association between glycan biomarker candidates and clinical risk factors. We performed area under the curve (AUC) analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curves by fivefold cross-validation for clinical risk factors, IgG glycans, and their combination. Two directly measured and four derived glycan peaks were significantly associated with T2DM, after correction for extensive clinical confounders and false discovery rate, thus suggesting that IgG N-glycan traits are highly correlated with T2DM clinical risk factors. Moreover, adding the IgG glycan profiles to fasting blood glucose in the logistic regression model increased the AUC from 0.799 to 0.859. The AUC for IgG glycans alone was 0.623 with a 95% confidence interval 0.580-0.666. In addition, our study provided new evidence of diversity in T2DM complex trait by IgG N-glycan stratification. Six IgG glycan traits were firmly associated with T2DM, which reflects an increased proinflammatory and biological aging status. In summary, our study reports novel associations between the IgG N-glycome and T2DM in an Australian population and the putative role of proinflammatory mechanisms. Furthermore, IgG N-glycomic alterations offer future prospects as inflammatory biomarker candidates for T2DM diagnosis, and monitoring of T2DM progression to cardiovascular disease or renal failure.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xingang Li"", ids = ""51070406""); list(name = ""Hao Wang"", ids = ""46506791""); list(name = ""Alyce Russell"", ids = ""3880061""); list(name = ""Weijie Cao"", ids = ""11036307""); list(name = ""Xueqing Wang"", ids = ""122024437""); list(name = ""Siqi Ge"", ids = ""8049375""); list(name = ""Yulu Zheng"", ids = ""12965054""); list(name = ""Zheng Xin Guo"", ids = ""144161493""); list(name = ""Haifeng Hou"", ids = ""12608226""); list(name = ""Manshu Song"", ids = ""145390381""); list(name = ""Xinwei Yu"", ids = ""1870707""); list(name = ""Youxin Wang"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Michael L Hunter"", ids = ""49364512""); list(name = ""Peter Roberts"", ids = ""37729794""); list(name = ""Gordan Lauc"", ids = ""4989206""); list(name = ""Wei Wang"", ids = ""84527479"")",,,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,,

We demonstrate this approach by examining the differential distribution of chronic medical conditions in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to the distribution of these conditions in their matched controls.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Newly diagnosed MDD patients were matched to controls based on their demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, place of residence, and healthcare service utilization in the Korean National Health Insurance Service's National Sample Cohort. Differences in the networks of chronic medical conditions in newly diagnosed MDD cases treated with antidepressants, and their matched controls, were prioritized with a permutation test accounting for the false discovery rate. Sensitivity analyses for the associations between prioritized pairs of chronic medical conditions and new MDD diagnosis were performed with regression modeling.


RESULTS
By comparing the association networks of chronic medical conditions in newly diagnosed depression patients and their matched controls, five pairs of such conditions were prioritized among 105 possible pairs after controlling the false discovery rate at 5%. In sensitivity analyses using regression modeling, four out of the five prioritized pairs were statistically significant for the interaction terms.


CONCLUSION
Association networks in a matched case-control design can provide a high-level comparison of comorbid features after adjusting for confounding factors, thereby supplementing traditional clinical study approaches. We demonstrate the differential co-occurrence pattern of chronic medical conditions in patients with MDD and prioritize the chronic conditions that have statistically significant interactions in regression models for depression.",2018,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Min-hyung Kim"", ids = ""6874787""); list(name = ""Samprit Banerjee"", ids = ""50063943""); list(name = ""Yize Zhao"", ids = ""145010647""); list(name = ""Fei Wang"", ids = ""1682816""); list(name = ""Yiye Zhang"", ids = ""2509064""); list(name = ""Yongjun Zhu"", ids = ""143918378""); list(name = ""Joseph J Deferio"", ids = ""3668795""); list(name = ""Lauren Evans"", ids = ""122692637""); list(name = ""Sang Min Park"", ids = ""2217335""); list(name = ""Jyotishman Pathak"", ids = ""145236681"")",e6f0728bc0ce0302733bed614a0399f5a2aa2bad; e22963205c107ca30098c65c07aee5b41b21236d,,Journal of biomedical informatics,87,"

Several choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a variety of tand F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as those based on correlation parameters) are included. When probing hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence function.

The unique benefit of using a library is knowing which identified crosslinks are true and which are false. Here we have used mass spectrometry data generated from measurement of the peptide libraries to evaluate the most frequently applied search algorithms in crosslinking mass-spectrometry. When filtered to an estimated false discovery rate of 5%, false crosslink identification ranged from 5.2% to 11.3% for search engines with inbuilt validation strategies for error estimation. When different external validation strategies were applied to one single search output, false crosslink identification ranged from 2.4% to a surprising 32%, despite being filtered to an estimated 5% false discovery rate. Remarkably, the use of MS-cleavable crosslinkers did not reduce the false discovery rate compared to non-cleavable crosslinkers, results from which have far-reaching implications in structural biology.

We propose that regional differences in intracardiac hemodynamics influence differential endocardial gene expression leading to phenotypic heterogeneity of this cell layer. Measurement of intracardiac hemodynamics was performed using 4-dimensional flow MRI in healthy humans (n=8) and pigs (n=5). Local wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear indices (OSI) were calculated in three distinct regions of the LV - base, mid-ventricle (midV), and apex. In both the humans and pigs, WSS values were significantly lower in the apex and midV relative to the base. Additionally, both the apex and midV had greater oscillatory shear indices (OSI) than the base. To investigate regional phenotype, endocardial endothelial cells (EEC) were isolated from an additional 8 pigs and RNA sequencing was performed. A false discovery rate of 0.10 identified 1051 differentially expressed genes between the base and apex, and 321 between base and midV. Pathway analyses revealed apical upregulation of genes associated with translation initiation. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI; mean 50-fold) and prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS; 5-fold), genes prominently associated with antithrombotic protection, were consistently upregulated in LV apex. These spatio-temporal WSS values in defined regions of the left ventricle link local hemodynamics to regional heterogeneity in endocardial gene expression.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Margaret E.

Beta oscillations play an important role in gating movement. Because pathological oscillatory changes in the beta band represent a hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD), tracking oscillatory changes in this band has been proposed as a marker for closed-loop stimulation. However, the dynamics of casual influences across the motor circuit during movement remain unknown. Using intracranial local field potential (LFP) recordings, we used both standard functional connectivity and event-related causality (ERC) techniques to explore these interactions.


METHODS
LFPs were recorded simultaneously from subthalamic nucleus (STN) and sensorimotor cortex, while PD subjects (n = 8) undergoing the implantation of DBS leads performed an incentivized, bimanual handgrip task. Using the beta frequency band between 13 and 30 Hz, functional connectivity was estimated using wavelet-based phase locking values (PLV), and ERC was calculated by constructing a multivariate autoregressive model based on the signal of interest from M1, S1, and STN channels. A false discovery rate correction of 5% was applied.


RESULTS
All the patients showed significant causal interactions between STN and sensorimotor cortex that coincided with movement epochs showing significant PLV on the individual level. In the 200 ms before movement, precentral beta activity modulated beta activity in the STN, implying that cortical beta activity drives the STN beta activity in that epoch. Reciprocal modulations between the cortex and STN were apparent at the termination of movement. Causal influences from the precentral cortex to the STN in the beta band around 0.5 ms after movement onset correlated significantly with the time to peak force (rho = 0.86, corrected P < .0028).


CONCLUSION
The directionality of causal interactions across the basal ganglia-cortical motor loop are specific to the directionality of causal interactions across the basal ganglia-cortical motor loop are specific to different phases of motor planning and execution. These novel data highlight the value of intraoperative recordings for furthering our understanding of cortical-basal ganglia models.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ahmad Alhourani"", ids = ""2474015""); list(name = ""Anna Korzeniewska"", ids = ""2312532""); list(name = ""Thomas A.

116663c49a502d7a62fe13f12d9691acf64d85fc,Identifying Direct Targets of the Hoxb4 Transcription Factor Involved in Hematopoietic Cell Self Renewal.,"Hoxb4 is a member of the homeobox protein family which when overexpressed, promotes expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) both in vivo and ex vivo. The molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity of Hoxb4 to induce self-renewal of HSCs are poorly understood. In order to identify the direct transcriptional targets of Hoxb4 in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, we created a Hoxb4-ERT2 fusion gene to allow for temporally regulated Hoxb4 activity. This gene was introduced into mouse lineage negative bone marrow (Lin âˆ’ BM) cells using retroviral-mediated gene transfer. When these cells were treated with Tamoxifen (TAM), translocation of the fusion protein into the nuclei was demonstrated using confocal microscopy. Transduced cells were treated with 300nM of TAM for varying time in suspension culture and then plated into semisolid medium for myeloid progenitor assays. After 7 days, colonies from these primary CFU-C cultures were dispersed and replated for secondary CFU-C as an assay for myeloid progenitor self renewal. Treatment with TAM for 12hr in Hoxb4-ERT2 introduced cells resulted in an increase in the number (5.5 fold) and size (10 fold) of secondary colonies comparing to mock vector transduced controls, verifying that TAM treatment resulted in self-renewal of myeloid progenitors. In order to identify the target genes for this response, RNA from 12hr and 24hr TAM treated cells was analyzed for differential gene expression using Affymetrix 430v2 chips. Analysis of three independent experiments showed good reproducibility and allowed identification of candidate genes.

201dadf91f2f89144aeec5a0656c6a4f0e4443ef,Extracting replicable associations across multiple studies: algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate,"In almost every field in genomics, large-scale biomedical datasets are used to report associations. Extracting associations that recur across multiple studies while controlling the false discovery rate is a fundamental challenge. Here, we consider an extension of Efronâ€™s single-study twogroups model to allow joint analysis of multiple studies. We assume that given a set of p-values obtained from each study, the researcher is interested in associations that recur in at least k > 1 studies. We propose new algorithms that differ in how the study dependencies are modeled. We compared our new methods and others using various simulated scenarios. The top performing algorithm, SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement), is our new algorithm that is based on three stages: (1) clustering an estimated correlation network of the studies, (2) learning replicability (e.g., of genes) within clusters, and (3) merging the results across the clusters using dynamic programming. We applied SCREEN to two real datasets and demonstrated that it greatly outperforms the results obtained via standard meta-analysis. First, on a collection of 29 case-control large-scale gene expression cancer studies, we detected a large up-regulated module of genes related to proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These genes are both consistently up-regulated across many cancer studies, and are well connected in known gene networks. Second, on a recent pan-cancer study that examined the expression profiles of patients with or without mutations in the HLA complex, we detected an active module of up-regulated genes that are related to immune responses. Thanks to our ability to quantify the false discovery rate, we detected thrice more genes as compared to the original study. Our module contains most of the genes reported in the original study, and many new ones. Interestingly, the newly discovered genes are needed to establish the connectivity of the module. Lay Summary When analyzing results from multiple studies, extracting replicated associations is the first step towards making new discoveries. The standard approach for this task is to use meta-analysis methods, which usually make an underlying null hypothesis that a gene has no effect in all 1 ar X iv :1 60 9. 01 11 8v 2 [ st at .M E ] 7 S ep 2 01 6 studies. On the other hand, in replicability analysis we explicitly require that the gene will manifest a recurring pattern of effects. In this study we develop new algorithms for replicability analysis that are both scalable (i.e., can handle many studies) and allow controlling the false discovery rate. We show that our main algorithm called SCREEN (Scalable Cluster-based REplicability ENhancement) outperforms the other methods in simulated scenarios. Moreover, when applied to real datasets, SCREEN greatly extended the results of the meta-analysis, and can even facilitate detection of new biological results. Introduction Confidence in reported findings is a prerequisite for advancing any scientific field. Such confidence is achieved by showing replication of discoveries by further evidence from new studies [1]. In recent years, a new type of methodology called replicability analysis, sometimes referred to as reproducibility analysis, was suggested as a way to statistically quantify the replication of discoveries across studies while controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR) [2]. This type of analysis is crucial in studies that aim to detect new hypotheses by integrating existing data from multiple high-throughput experiments. The practical importance of replicability analysis is twofold. First, it is a tool for quantifying replication, and therefore the reliability, of reported results. This is of vital importance as in recent years concerns have been raised in several domains regarding low reproducibility, including economics [3], psychology [4], medicine [5], and biological studies that rely on high throughput experiments such as gene expression profiling [6,7], and network biology [8]. Second, collating information from multiple studies can lead to scientific results that may be beyond the reach of a single study. Indeed, replicability analysis was demonstrated as a tool for extracting new results by merging Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) [9]. The underlying assumption in standard meta-analysis is that the multiple studies estimate the same effect. Aggregating information across studies produces estimators with smaller measurement error that yield considerably more power to reject the null hypothesis regarding this effect. While meta-analyses are widely applied and have been extensively studied in the statistical literature [10] and in computational biology [11, 12], in recent years the changes in the scale and also the scope of public high-throughput biomedical data has led to new methodological challenges. For example, Zeggini et al. [13] analyzed results of genome-wide association scans for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) on the same set of almost 2.5 million SNPs from eight study populations. In such situations, the first, and more obvious, challenge is accounting for inflation in the number of false discoveries due to the multiplicity of outcomes. The second challenge is hidden in the null hypothesis that the effect size is 0 in all the studies (as done in meta-analysis). That assumption is oblivious to the consistency of the effects, and thus it overlooks important scientific information. Third, there is a need to distinguish between true effects that are specific to a single study and true effects that represent general discoveries that are replicable. For example, Kraft et al. [14] suggested that for common genetic",2016,,"list(name = ""David Amar"", ids = ""2102414""); list(name = ""Ron Shamir"", ids = ""1723209""); list(name = ""Daniel Yekutieli"", ids = ""2398627"")",,100958c808b7109593d14bcc577f4abe4163e4f9; ba7684a2a2b46a1ed9fc5bc0d18bda2de4eb455e; c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; 988dcf79f4f6fc3ab388bff29ace77da4edd995b; 9771d2df7eb353df6db994223a46a911f91bbeb1; 2249ea630e56e4991aa157ad9aea65262efe4562; f7c0b68feb0e7662d7540605e1a0768d5183e9d0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 3acd41eeafe82b68094fdf0a487d8781b01fb790; 388b57e58d69b67fcc47b771b2ff7c00ccd28bd4; 6e71451b5380528ac7b36da7285616e90e32a724; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; a603812c1e0aeb46d02c86a2668276c9a5f0bed6; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 1823026160626ed2cd47de840d3829a7bb2ebb38; fd3d628f90e73744621c26421869d90e7eddeb3f; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; 14ec81e5cedf3eb950054f6d7bfce134f2beac72; 1d5ff03d8fa2c2255bc79248d1c2bca3caf79a0b; 9eb8ae39a3f7788a0fbc9b16c48de4489e5b952f; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; fde12e0b207bcd0ee820f4645d63132458bafdbd; ecd106603d06539df2a95b6e31d935ed8dbc45b4; bf64fe0b51a3968717ef59e13bd92e33d64e115d; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 065216b473e94affbe20cd1003e1c3d6a080cef5; 8e46ff6c5fa533ea3e0e4faf1bba7387a13dbb0e; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; 71039c4545cee4df3a690cc4778a59b75e91d1bb; 0e797fb75e9340807d3028aeb45f993825822a30; 3209b7e1dde59a28b7452e19b884d45ccb1bc704; ab020221cab8457456c584981a0c018c4a863796; 217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; fa8094496c415216f76c685d28b4cc7832eb6588; 1c78c1879b3ad206073adebd03005240c7c6278a; f5c19314c9d1d48e8c1c28d823a6b8bf03c727fe; 7b17ab03214fb73a627982156bb1ffcf3652ad2f,,,

Here, one of the important roles of statistics is to quantify reproducibility rigorously. Two concepts were recently defined for this purpose: (i) rediscovery rate (RDR), which is the expected proportion of statistically significant findings in a study that can be replicated in the validation study and (ii) false discovery rate in the validation study (vFDR). In this paper, we aim to develop a nonparametric approach to estimate the RDR and vFDR and show an explicit link between the RDR and the FDR. Among other things, the link explains why reproducing statistically significant results even with low FDR level may be difficult. Two metabolomics datasets are considered to illustrate the application of the RDR and vFDR concepts in high-throughput data analysis.

652ad5da776d53e0a11f4d59ad1cc4a7044242ce,Identification of new ovulation-related genes in humans by comparing the transcriptome of granulosa cells before and after ovulation triggering in the same controlled ovarian stimulation cycle.,"STUDY QUESTION
Which genes and molecular mechanisms are involved in the human ovulatory cascade and final oocyte maturation?


SUMMARY ANSWER
Up-regulated genes in granulosa cells (GC) represented inflammation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, growth factors and genes previously associated with ovarian cancer, while down-regulated genes mainly represented cell cycle and proliferation.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Radical changes occur in the follicle during final follicle maturation after the ovulatory trigger: these range from ensuring an optimal milieu for the oocyte in meiotic arrest to the release of a mature oocyte and remodeling into a corpus luteum. A wide range of mediators of final follicle maturation has been identified in rodents, non-human primates and cows.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
Prospective cohort study including 24 women undergoing ovarian stimulation with the long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist protocol during 2010-2012 at HolbÃ¦k Fertility Clinic. Nine paired samples of GC and 24 paired samples of follicular fluid (FF) were obtained before and after recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG) administration.


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
Nine paired (nine arrays before rhCG and nine arrays after rhCG) samples of GC mRNA were amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST GeneChip arrays, compared and bioinformatically analyzed. Eleven selected genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. FF hormones were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Eleven hundred and eighty-six genes were differentially expressed (>2-fold, P<0.0001, false discovery rate <0.0012) when comparing GC isolated before and 36 h after hCG, among those were genes known to be expressed at ovulation, i.e. ADAMTS1 and HAS2. Many new ovulation-related genes were revealed, such as CD24, ANKRD22, CLDN11 and FBXO32. FF estrogen, androstenedione and anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone decreased significantly while progesterone increased, accompanied by radical changes in the expression of steroidogenic genes (CYP17A, CYP19A, HSD11B1 and HSD11B2, StAR). Genes related to inflammation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation, growth factors and cancer were up-regulated while cell cycle genes were massively down-regulated. Seventy-two genes previously described in connection with ovarian cancer were among the highly regulated genes. In silico analysis for top upstream regulators of the ovulatory trigger suggested--besides LH--TNF, IGF1, PGR, AR, EGR1 (early growth response 1), ERK1/2 (extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2) and CDKN1A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A) as potential mediators of the LH/hCG response.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
The present dataset was generated from women under hormonal stimulation. However, comparison with a macaque natural cycle whole follicle ovulation dataset revealed major overlap, supporting the idea that the ovulation-related genes found in this study are relevant in the human natural cycle.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
These data will serve as a research resource for genes involved in human ovulation and final oocyte maturation. Ovulation-related genes might be good candidate biomarkers of follicle and oocyte health. Further, some of the ovulation-related genes may serve as future ovarian cancer biomarkers.

ff7d24de8a41e7e0db509817dfd77cfbc0d052d5,Hematopoietic stem cell mobilization with G-CSF induces innate inflammation yet suppresses adaptive immune gene expression as revealed by microarray analysis.,"OBJECTIVE
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used to boost granulocyte counts in immunocompromised patients, but its effects on the immune system may be counterproductive. We tested the hypothesis that G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) products are immunologically downregulated based on gene microarray analysis.


METHODS
Ten peripheral blood samples from normal donors for allogeneic PBSC transplantation were obtained before and after administration of G-CSF and tested on Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip microarrays and by flow cytometry. Significant changes in gene expression after G-CSF were reported by controlling the false discovery rate at 5%. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to validate expression of representative genes.


RESULTS
All immune cells measured, including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, were significantly increased after G-CSF. In terms of gene expression, inflammatory and neutrophil activation pathways were upregulated after G-CSF. However, adaptive immune-related gene expression, such as antigen presentation, co-stimulation, T-cell activation and cytolytic effector responses, were downregulated.


CONCLUSION

f7428c20532a9c7cf1cdc890916d430484563d63,LACC1 polymorphisms in inflammatory bowel disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"The function of the Laccase domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene is unknown, but genetic variation at this locus has been reported to consistently affect the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and leprosy. Recently, a LACC1 missense mutation was found in patients suffering from monogenic forms of CD, but also systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We tested the hypothesis that LACC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in addition to CD, are associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, non-systemic), and another major form of inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC). We selected 11 LACC1 tagging SNPs, and tested their effect on disease risk in 3855 Swedish individuals from three caseâ€“control cohorts of CD, UC and JIA. We detected false discovery rate corrected significant associations with individual markers in all three cohorts, thereby expanding previous results for CD also to UC and JIA. LACC1â€™s link to several inflammatory diseases suggests a key role in the human immune system and justifies further characterization of its function(s).",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ghazaleh Assadi"", ids = ""3751698""); list(name = ""Reham H.

4ad5c71e64d269e4f5f232bd0e99a26b1948fe26,Metagenome phylogenetic profiling of microbial community evolution in a tetrachloroethene-contaminated aquifer responding to enhanced reductive dechlorination protocols,"Chlorinated solvent contamination of potable water supplies is a serious problem worldwide. Biostimulation protocols can successfully remediate chlorinated solvent contamination through enhanced reductive dechlorination pathways, however the process is poorly understood and sometimes stalls creating a more serious problem. Whole metagenome techniques have the potential to reveal details of microbial community changes induced by biostimulation. Here we compare the metagenome of a tetrachloroethene contaminated Environmental Protection Agency Superfund Site before and after the application of biostimulation protocols. Environmental DNA was extracted from uncultured microbes that were harvested by on-site filtration of groundwater one month prior to and five months after the injection of emulsified vegetable oil, nutrients, and hydrogen gas bioamendments. Pair-end libraries were prepared for high-throughput DNA sequencing and 90 basepairs from both ends of randomly fragmented 400 basepair DNA fragments were sequenced. Over 31 millions reads were annotated with Metagenome Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology representing 32 prokaryotic phyla, 869 genera, and 3,181 species. A 3.6 log2 fold increase in biomass as measured by DNA yield per mL water was measured, but there was a 9% decrease in the number of genera detected post-remediation. We apply Bayesian statistical methods to assign false discovery rates to fold-change abundance data and use Zipfâ€™s power law to filter genera with low read counts. Plotting the log-rank against the log-fold-change facilitates the visualization of the changes in the community in response to the enhanced reductive dechlorination protocol. Members of the Archaea domain increased 4.7 log2 fold, dominated by methanogens. Prior to remediation, classes Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria dominated the community but exhibit significant decreases five months after biostimulation. Geobacter and Sulfurospirillum replace â€œSideroxydansâ€ and Burkholderia as the most abundant genera. As a result of biostimulation, Deltaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria capable of dehalogenation, iron and sulfate reduction, and sulfur oxidation increase. Matches to thermophilic, haloalkane respiring archaea is evidence for additional species involved in biodegradation of chlorinated solvents. Additionally, potentially pathogenic bacteria increase, indicating that there may be unintended consequences of bioremediation.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebecca A.

Three hundred eighty-four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 251 genes based on pathways potentially relevant to HDL-C metabolism were selected and genotyped in 3,575 subjects from the Doetinchem cohort, which was examined thrice over 11 years. Three hundred fifty-three SNPs in 239 genes passed the quality-control criteria. Seven SNPs [rs1800777 and rs5882 in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP); rs3208305, rs328, and rs268 in LPL; rs1800588 in LIPC; rs2229741 in NRIP1] were associated with plasma HDL-C levels with false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted q values (FDR_q) < 0.05. Five other SNPs (rs17585739 in SC4MOL, rs11066322 in PTPN11, rs4961 in ADD1, rs6060717 near SCAND1, and rs3213451 in MBTPS2 in women) were associated with plasma HDL-C levels with FDR_q between 0.05 and 0.2. Two less well replicated associations (rs3135506 in APOA5 and rs1800961 in HNF4A) known from the literature were also observed, but their significance disappeared after adjustment for multiple testing (P = 0.008, FDR_q = 0.221 for rs3135506; P = 0.018, FDR_q = 0.338 for rs1800961, respectively). In addition to replication of previous results for candidate genes (CETP, LPL, LIPC, HNF4A, and APOA5), we found interesting new candidate SNPs (rs2229741 in NRIP1, rs3213451 in MBTPS2, rs17585739 in SC4MOL, rs11066322 in PTPN11, rs4961 in ADD1, and rs6060717 near SCAND1) for plasma HDL-C levels that should be evaluated further.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yingchang Lu"", ids = ""36243458""); list(name = ""Martijn E.

a707b30842179fbcb2e3d25a97d1cd509ab01379,Quantitative Genomics of Aggressive Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,"Aggressive behavior is important for animal survival and reproduction, and excessive aggression is an enormous social and economic burden for human society. Although the role of biogenic amines in modulating aggressive behavior is well characterized, other genetic mechanisms affecting this complex behavior remain elusive. Here, we developed an assay to rapidly quantify aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, and generated replicate selection lines with divergent levels of aggression. The realized heritability of aggressive behavior was approximately 0.10, and the phenotypic response to selection specifically affected aggression. We used whole-genome expression analysis to identify 1,539 probe sets with different expression levels between the selection lines when pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of 0.001. We quantified the aggressive behavior of 19 mutations in candidate genes that were generated in a common co-isogenic background, and identified 15 novel genes affecting aggressive behavior. Expression profiling of genetically divergent lines is an effective strategy for identifying genes affecting complex traits.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexis C.

c00b129125919a72fe4735562a662444a71b177c,A candidate gene association study of alcohol consumption in young women.,"BACKGROUND
Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Heritable influences contribute to 50% of the variation in alcohol consumption, suggesting the important role of genes. We used data on a previously defined alcohol consumption factor score in a sample of 827 young women to investigate association with 1,014 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to addiction.


METHODS
Data were drawn from the Missouri Adolescent Female Twin Study (MOAFTS) with replication in the college drinking sample (CDS). Genotypic and phenotypic data were available on 827 MOAFTS and 100 CDS women of European-American ancestry. Data on 1,014 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 130 genes related to addiction were utilized. Association was conducted in QTDT, which allows for identity-by-descent information to account accurately for twin status in the analysis. The total association variance components model was used, with specification of variance components for relatedness in MOAFTS.


RESULTS
The top signals included clusters of SNPs in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) (e.g., rs1386496, p = 0.0003) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC) (e.g., rs3779084, p = 0.0008), genes that encode proteins responsible for serotonin synthesis. Additional polymorphisms in ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH7, and ADH1A1 were also associated at p < 0.05. The false discovery rate for the top signal (p = 0.0003) was 0.15, suggesting nominal significance only. Replication was limited and noted for 2 SNPs in ADH1C.


CONCLUSIONS
While no results survive the burden of multiple testing, nominal findings in TPH2 and DDC suggest the potential role of the serotonin synthesis pathway in alcohol consumption.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Arpana Agrawal"", ids = ""145972498""); list(name = ""Michael T.

170f8502cd020bba9e2ff694ea63a8934da3c35a,Exome sequencing of 457 autism families recruited online provides evidence for novel ASD genes,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically heterogeneous condition, caused by a combination of rare de novo and inherited variants as well as common variants in at least several hundred genes. However, significantly larger sample sizes are needed to identify the complete set of genetic risk factors. We conducted a pilot study for SPARK (SPARKForAutism.org) of 457 families with ASD, all consented online. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and genotyping data were generated for each family using DNA from saliva. We identified variants in genes and loci that are clinically recognized causes or significant contributors to ASD in 10.4% of families without previous genetic findings. Additionally, we identified variants that are possibly associated with autism in an additional 3.4% of families. A meta-analysis using the TADA framework at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.2 provides statistical support for 34 ASD risk genes with at least one damaging variant identified in SPARK. Nine of these genes (BRSK2, DPP6, EGR3, FEZF2, ITSN1, KDM1B, NR4A2, PAX5 and RALGAPB) are newly emerging genes in autism, of which BRSK2 has the strongest statistical support as a risk gene for autism (TADA q-value = 0.0015). Future studies leveraging the thousands of individuals with ASD that have enrolled in SPARK are likely to further clarify the genetic risk factors associated with ASD as well as allow accelerate autism research that incorporates genetic etiology.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Pamela Feliciano"", ids = ""5435958""); list(name = ""Xueya Zhou"", ids = ""50177358""); list(name = ""Irina Astrovskaya"", ids = ""1412744122""); list(name = ""Tychele N Turner"", ids = ""25968969""); list(name = ""Tianyun Wang"", ids = ""48469846""); list(name = ""Leo Brueggeman"", ids = ""2429171""); list(name = ""Rebecca A.

6081a1460920af2f2480b3a5c5ece36c71008490,Molecular classification of gastric cancer: a new paradigm.,"PURPOSE
Gastric cancer may be subdivided into 3 distinct subtypes--proximal, diffuse, and distal gastric cancer--based on histopathologic and anatomic criteria. Each subtype is associated with unique epidemiology. Our aim is to test the hypothesis that these distinct gastric cancer subtypes may also be distinguished by gene expression analysis.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Patients with localized gastric adenocarcinoma being screened for a phase II preoperative clinical trial (National Cancer Institute, NCI #5917) underwent endoscopic biopsy for fresh tumor procurement. Four to 6 targeted biopsies of the primary tumor were obtained. Macrodissection was carried out to ensure more than 80% carcinoma in the sample. HG-U133A GeneChip (Affymetrix) was used for cDNA expression analysis, and all arrays were processed and analyzed using the Bioconductor R-package.


RESULTS
Between November 2003 and January 2006, 57 patients were screened to identify 36 patients with localized gastric cancer who had adequate RNA for expression analysis. Using supervised analysis, we built a classifier to distinguish the 3 gastric cancer subtypes, successfully classifying each into tightly grouped clusters. Leave-one-out cross-validation error was 0.14, suggesting that more than 85% of samples were classified correctly. Gene set analysis with the false discovery rate set at 0.25 identified several pathways that were differentially regulated when comparing each gastric cancer subtype to adjacent normal stomach.


CONCLUSIONS

8795565980c959b71c39c5db029aa992e20c6d2c,SU-F-R-52: A Comparison of the Performance of Radiomic Features From Free Breathing and 4DCT Scans in Predicting Disease Recurrence in Lung Cancer SBRT Patients.,"PURPOSE
There is a clinical need to identify patients who are at highest risk of recurrence after being treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Radiomics offers a non-invasive approach by extracting quantitative features from medical images based on tumor phenotype that is predictive of an outcome. Lung cancer patients treated with SBRT routinely undergo free breathing (FB image) and 4DCT (average intensity projection (AIP) image) scans for treatment planning to account for organ motion. The aim of the current study is to evaluate and compare the prognostic performance of radiomic features extracted from FB and AIP images in lung cancer patients treated with SBRT to identify which image type would generate an optimal predictive model for recurrence.


METHODS
FB and AIP images of 113 Stage I-II NSCLC patients treated with SBRT were analysed. The prognostic performance of radiomic features for distant metastasis (DM) was evaluated by their concordance index (CI). Radiomic features were compared with conventional imaging metrics (e.g. diameter). All p-values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
All patients received SBRT and 20.4% of patients developed DM. From each image type (FB or AIP), nineteen radiomic features were selected based on stability and variance. Both image types had five common and fourteen different radiomic features. One FB (CI=0.70) and five AIP (CI range=0.65-0.68) radiomic features were significantly prognostic for DM (p<0.05). None of the conventional features derived from FB images (range CI=0.60-0.61) were significant but all AIP conventional features were (range CI=0.64-0.66).


CONCLUSION
Features extracted from different types of CT scans have varying prognostic performances. AIP images contain more prognostic radiomic features for DM than FB images. These methods can provide personalized medicine approaches at low cost, as FB and AIP data are readily available within a large number of radiation oncology departments.

a5436df1cafbfff04961b106e5d02d5c951d2012,Abstract 285: Integrative analyses of genome-wide expression of miRNAs and DNA methylation patterns in hepatocellular carcinoma to improve functional biomarker identification,"Previous studies, including ours have examined aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and altered DNA methylation, and several miRNAs have been identified as regulated by DNA methylation. However, whether this mechanism occurs at a genome-wide level and is related to the profiles of dysregulated miRNA commonly observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is largely unknown. Using a two-phase study design, we conducted a genome-wide screening for miRNA expression and DNA methylation profiles in the tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from US HCC cases. The discovery and validation sets included, respectively, 10 and 56 paired tumor/non-tumor tissues. TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDA) covering 733 miRNAs were used to measure expression profiles, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate candidate miRNA signatures. Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip arrays covering 3,439 CpG sites for 727 miRNAs were used to determine DNA methylation patterns. Comparing expression profiles in HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, we found that 25 miRNAs were statistically significantly different with over 2-fold expression changes after adjusting for false discovery rate (FDR); a perfect classification of HCC tissues was observed. Six of the aberrant miRNAs were over-expressed in HCC tumor tissue (range from 2.7 to 18-fold), while 19 miRNAs were downregulated in tumor tissue (range from -2.5 to -7.5-fold). Several miRNAs (miR-139, miR-196b, miR-381, miR-486 and miR-1180) were identified for the first time as having a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. After Bonferroni adjustment, a total of 1,256 CpG sites covering 412 miRNAs showed significant differences in DNA methylation levels between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, including 185 hypermethylated and 1,071 hypomethylated CpG sites in tumor tissues. We further conducted integrative analyses of the correlations between miRNAs expression and DNA methylation patterns for 222 miRNAs detected in over 80% of the tissue samples. As expected, inverse correlations were observed for 91.7% (55/60) of up-regulated miRNAs with a DNA hypomethylation change, and for 48.1% (78/162) of down-regulated miRNAs with a DNA hypermethylation change. However, for only 8 miRNAsâ€™ (3.6%) did expression levels achieve statistically significant differences between tumor and non-tumor tissues in accord with DNA methylation alterations. A validation study of six of the candidates in an additional 56 paired HCC tissues confirmed the aberrant miRNAs expression patterns observed in tumor tissue. The inverse correlations between miRNAsâ€™ expression and DNA methylation were concordant for all 27 CpG sites in the 4 miRNAs (miR-18a, miR-125b-1, miR-182 and miR-199a-1). These data suggest that a small proportion of DNA methylation changes can lead to significant dysregulation of miRNAs in HCC tumor tissue. Citation Format: Jing Shen, Shuang Wang, Abby B.

a2492501ed4629bde7365c841df33470f0ce39da,Large-scale SNP genotyping in crosses between outbred lines: how useful is it?,"Although genome-wide association (GWA) studies are not worth the effort in crosses between inbred lines, many crosses are actually made up of divergent yet outbred populations. Despite its relevance, however, this experimental setting has not been studied at a time when SNP microarrays are available in many species. To assess whether GWA can be useful in this setting, we performed combined coalescenceâ€”gene dropping simulations. We studied the influence of marker density, QTL effect and QTL allele frequency on power, false discovery rate (FDR) and accuracy. Our results suggest that GWA in outbred F2 crosses is useful, especially in large populations. Under these circumstances, accuracy increased and FDR decreased as compared with classical linkage analysis. However, current SNP densities (in the order of 30â€“60â€‰K SNPs/genome or equivalent to 10â€“20 SNPs per cM) may not be much better than linkage analysis and higher SNP densities may be required. SNP ascertainment had an important effect; the best option was to select SNPs as uniformly as possible without setting any restriction on allele frequency. Using only SNPs with fixed alternative alleles in each breed controlled false positive rate but was not useful to detect variability within lines. Finally, the most significant SNP was not necessarily the closest to the causal SNP, although the closest SNPs were usually above the significance threshold; thus, it is prudent to follow-up significant signals located in regions of interest even if they do not correspond to absolute maxima.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""MÃ´nica CorrÃªa Ledur"", ids = ""6183565""); list(name = ""Nicolas Navarro"", ids = ""144352320""); list(name = ""Miguel PÃ©rez-Enciso"", ids = ""1396536611"")",c43fb3794dcb8d9473cfc0a8341be2f93d965492; 5df17ed8a7346b0374211328d615a69ec2594fab; 2811f76635d6ef9fe540afaaef388f4284655f75; 96064510407819cc493a99a38b8393a5f8124663; bc501beb570e6c325c03430c6e55b83131c12894; 017ac3d48cb2173b9c154c6ab4ebcbd2767fa7e3; d96eef0741651a545083fa81d0f5746df9211c3c; b79556856036f0974e14baab1a30bd97341c8053; 51cc67bcbd6248311a381b2309ccf5931e9656b9; 473b766fef3065e2a92c4fbc093ef9527bc4900d; ead14631594d36e38eb7d38f01961452990bf3f6; 0ff18b994ba75f0555d809ee03a983b069a9fd8a; 3cca6ae6a310deceee8a395048494f8223e55a75; 68dd67b823824048e0142c6e9820dcc6ad163e8e; 84e6431913b22e18fc8cafea96b9dfea2390402f,7ae4bf699e7bfd05704152c8a94c7cdd3289f60e; a2d6280b3425ca7f54a2af0008f8f96e3b2fef3e; eb8778c3d2d596faba9f8ec2b37acfbca1d2f78a; ac0cd0ba89d33a3c05e81624c686f9b425c70b86; 148f178f88db8949febc7943719204b42fd4e4e5; 8280e059830c279265927a7882b862e3fd5054a0; c5fe67ab87757ac17d41ace71dc151044045d751; e3d531fcf4ef7815e41958293ee7734428610a0a; f6bc14deeefe5a780fe1e1ed3b9fc18bebf1d8f3; 9e96b87992072b7eae572c0f9d783d6a7b04dceb; c25971e0683d6d9a8733b84a8c321588846c28cc; 0dad85e93efed5590e5231a97de100f17da4650e; 3b3aa6db71517c7557bd0aead9f2299eb2c3b7aa; 184a1d99ac0d00694e61999e185e16431eb5f586; 3cc31b101df7f3f6dd20b9fe45851ac1f2c00fa1; 5073392bbd65eb7b19c479cc48ebf6906dddf257; f2e5c1f9543de8b472ec932dd38352b22f812843; 5ddbabaf1df95d969ba13f1e8f915de5e78002fa; dbc5b5d6406e93b302fd99d33d555066334a5f18; 2383db246b792776114a6ba0e5527d9c78d10cfd; c99455b473157f3532fcc5a0cbe3fb3fc5ab545f; 654be56a9db6f38531555ebd87dbbc8089451605; 269f4c4336d7af20ec126b00fe5815cb61c77ad1,Heredity,105,173-182
776934497cb936ae3f584d2d50582d22f83140fa,A factor-adjusted multiple testing procedure for ERP data analysis,"Event-related potentials (ERPs) are now widely collected in psychological research to determine the time courses of mental events. When event-related potentials from treatment conditions are compared, often there is no a priori information on when or how long the differences should occur. Testing simultaneously for differences over the entire set of time points creates a serious multiple comparison problem in which the probability of false positive errors must be controlled, while maintaining reasonable power for correct detection. In this work, we extend the factor-adjusted multiple testing procedure developed by Friguet, Kloareg, and Causeur (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 104, 1406â€“1415, 2009) to manage the multiplicity problem in ERP data analysis and compare its performance with that of the Benjamini and Hochberg (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society B, 57, 289â€“300, 1995) false discovery rate procedure, using simulations. The proposed procedure outperformed the latter in detecting more truly significant time points, in addition to reducing the variability of the false discovery rate, suggesting that corrections for mass multiple testings of ERPs can be much improved by modeling the strong local temporal dependencies.",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""David Causeur"", ids = ""2234785""); list(name = ""Mei-Chen Chu"", ids = ""1924242""); list(name = ""Shulan Hsieh"", ids = ""37818449""); list(name = ""Ching-Fan Sheu"", ids = ""145813305"")",bcf15c2c260517184b73321727f287fe0be92ebd; ec4d977d17b3f42fe47c71a1ad05f89e138fce56; c9ac002f079c86da24d3f3ba842d36b4b840b517; 31d51c8f692f997a20b018d0dd321667594df0dd; d829e9312f5bbfbd1e1c7234e00a4480c176bd5d; 6f5486c415a6aae48fbbc546358993d551ac1cd4; 1c55a47755f507ef7cf090055acec565864dacb4; d70d0c495a7739e41e0b5e5f548f2e6fade44834,,Behavior Research Methods,44,635-643

007f5415bc0a06edf255aa631a6c0680ba5078c6,Bayesian Modeling of MPSS Data: Gene Expression Analysis of Bovine Salmonella Infection.,"Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) is a high-throughput counting-based technology available for gene expression profiling. It produces output that is similar to Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and is ideal for building complex relational databases for gene expression. Our goal is to compare the in vivo global gene expression profiles of tissues infected with different strains of Salmonella obtained using the MPSS technology. In this article, we develop an exact ANOVA type model for this count data using a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution, different from existing methods that assume continuous densities. We adopt two Bayesian hierarchical models-one parametric and the other semiparametric with a Dirichlet process prior that has the ability to ""borrow strength"" across related signatures, where a signature is a specific arrangement of the nucleotides, usually 16-21 base-pairs long. We utilize the discreteness of Dirichlet process prior to cluster signatures that exhibit similar differential expression profiles. Tests for differential expression are carried out using non-parametric approaches, while controlling the false discovery rate. We identify several differentially expressed genes that have important biological significance and conclude with a summary of the biological discoveries.",2010,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Soma S.

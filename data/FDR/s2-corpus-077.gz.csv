0746795064581c5fb515383eaf301ac067f66870,Serum protein profile of yang-deficiency constitution in traditional Chinese medicine revealed by protein microarray analyses,"Abstract Background Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and pre-epidemiological investigation, Professor Qi Wang classified the entire human population into nine constitutions and put forward the theory of â€œNine-Constitution Medicine.â€ Among these constitutions, the main feature of the yang-deficiency constitution (YADC) is intolerance of the cold, which has been proven to reduce quality of life and confer susceptibility to specific diseases. Previous studies explored the genetic and transcriptional bases of YADC. In this experiment, we explored the potential mechanism of YADC using protein microarray, to deepen our understanding of its biological mechanism. Methods Subjects identified with a YADC (nÂ =Â 12) or a balance constitution (BC; nÂ =Â 12) in accordance with the Classification and Determination Standards of Constitutions in Traditional Chinese Medicine were selected. Blood was collected to separate serum and protein microarray technology was used to analyze serum protein expression. Results The clustering of subjectsâ€™ constitutions based on protein expression profiling largely coincided with the TCM classification. Based on false discovery rate correction (PÂ  Conclusion This study revealed that YADC exhibits systematic differences in its protein expression profile. Moreover, we can potentially explain the characteristics of YADC partly via differentially expressed proteins.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Shuxian Sun"", ids = ""47392713""); list(name = ""Xiuping Zhang"", ids = ""49469590""); list(name = ""Jiayi Ma"", ids = ""8555475""); list(name = ""Cheng Ni"", ids = ""2228491""); list(name = ""Xiao Guang Ying"", ids = ""48942503""); list(name = ""Ji Wang"", ids = ""5107518""); list(name = ""Lingru Li"", ids = ""8447483""); list(name = ""Wenlin Yuan"", ids = ""40239204""); list(name = ""Xujun Heng"", ids = ""91641000""); list(name = ""Jing Xia"", ids = ""144390807"")",,,Journal of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences,6,67-74
7e2819c74c5f9c3039d2c9fa6c96f931a46058ad,"New multiple testing method under no dependency assumption, with application to multiple comparisons problem","Traditional multiple hypotheses testing mainly focuses on constructing stepwise procedures under some error rate control, such as familywise error rate (FWER), false discovery rate, and so forth. However, most of these procedures are obtained in independent case, and when there exists correlation across tests, the dependency may increase or decrease the chance of false rejections. In this paper, a totally different testing method is proposed, which doesnâ€™t focus on specific error control, but pays attention to the overall performance of the collection of hypotheses and the structure utilization among hypotheses. Since the main purpose of multiple testing is to pick out the false ones from the whole hypotheses and present a rejection set, motivated by the principle of simple hypothesis testing, we give the final testing result based on the estimation of the set of all the true null hypotheses. Our method can be applied in any dependent case provided that a reasonable $$p$$p-value can be obtained for each intersection hypothesis. We illustrate the new procedures with application to multiple comparisons problems. Theoretical results show the consistency of our method, and investigate their FWER behavior. Simulation results suggest that our procedures have a better overall performance than some existing procedures in dependent cases, especially in the total number of type I and type II errors.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Li Wang"", ids = ""46659134""); list(name = ""Xingzhong Xu"", ids = ""1704059""); list(name = ""Yong A"", ids = ""9295189"")",8c89115ab43899171afc67c1ac0f7bd19bef0961,,Statistical Papers,57,161-183

Lymphocytic myocarditis is a clinically important condition that is difficult to diagnose and distinguish. We hypothesized that the transcriptome obtained from an endomyocardial biopsy would yield clinically relevant and accurate molecular signatures.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Microarray analysis was performed on samples from patients with histologically proven lymphocytic myocarditis (n=16) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n=32) to develop accurate diagnostic transcriptome-based biomarkers using multiple classification algorithms. We identified 9878 differentially expressed genes in lymphocytic myocarditis versus idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (fold change >1.2; false discovery rate <5%) from which a transcriptome-based biomarker containing 62 genes was identified that distinguished myocarditis with 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 46 to 100) and 100% specificity (95% confidence interval, 66 to 100) and was generalizable to a broad range of secondary cardiomyopathies associated with inflammation (n=27), ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=8), and the normal heart (n=11). Multiple classification algorithms and quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis further reduced this subset to a highly robust molecular signature of 13 genes, which still performed with 100% accuracy.


CONCLUSIONS
Together, these findings demonstrate that transcriptomic biomarkers from a single endomyocardial biopsy can improve the clinical detection of patients with inflammatory diseases of the heart. This approach advances the clinical management and treatment of cardiac disorders with highly variable outcome.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bettina Heidecker"", ids = ""4216197""); list(name = ""Michelle M Kittleson"", ids = ""5168600""); list(name = ""Edward K.

987718b23ff0c27c0cd99702ede5bbfd52b2ee93,Target-Decoy Approach and False Discovery Rate: When Things May Go Wrong,"The target-decoy approach (TDA) has done the field of proteomics a great service by filling in the need to estimate the false discovery rates (FDR) of peptide identifications. While TDA is often viewed as a universal solution to the problem of FDR evaluation, we argue that the time has come to critically re-examine TDA and to acknowledge not only its merits but also its demerits. We demonstrate that some popular MS/MS search tools are not TDA-compliant and that it is easy to develop a non-TDA compliant tool that outperforms all TDA-compliant tools. Since the distinction between TDA-compliant and non-TDA compliant tools remains elusive, we are concerned about a possible proliferation of non-TDA-compliant tools in the future (developed with the best intentions).

8935d83c3f2184a88ac0b8ecd6e7c289ed385034,Genome-wide copy number analyses of samples from LACE-Bio project identify novel prognostic and predictive markers in early stage non-small cell lung cancer.,"Background
Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) provides modest benefit in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Genome-wide studies have identified gene copy number aberrations (CNA), but their prognostic implication is unknown.


Methods
DNA from 1,013 FFPE tumor samples from three pivotal multicenter randomized trials (ACT vs. control) in the LACE-Bio consortium (median follow-up: 5.2 years) was successfully extracted, profiled using a molecular inversion probe SNP assay, normalized relative to a pool of normal tissues and segmented. Minimally recurrent regions were identified. P values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate (Q values).


Results
A total of 976 samples successfully profiled, 414 (42%) adenocarcinoma (ADC), 430 (44%) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 132 (14%) other NSCLC; 710 (73%) males. We identified 431 recurrent regions, with on average 51 gains and 43 losses; 253 regions (59%) were â‰¤3 Mb. Most frequent gains (up to 48%) were on chr1, 3q, 5p, 6p, 8q, 22q; most frequent losses (up to 40%) on chr3p, 8p, 9p. CNA frequency of 195 regions was significantly different (Qâ‰¤0.05) between ADC and SCC. Fourteen regions (7p11-12, 9p21, 18q12, and 19p11-13) were associated with disease-free survival (DFS) (univariate Pâ‰¤0.005, Q<0.142), with poorer DFS for losses of regions including CDKN2A/B [hazard ratio (HR) for 2-fold lower CN: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2-1.9), P<0.001, Q=0.020] and STK11 [HR =2.4 (1.3-4.3), P=0.005, Q=0.15]. Chromosomal instability was associated with poorer DFS (HR =1.5, P=0.015), OS (HR =1.2, P=0.189) and lung-cancer specific survival (HR =1.7, P=0.003).

fa5ddb6ad6a9d73f434095d4f9d84169be4d7657,Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease.,"Genetic factors contribute importantly to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the past decade, there has been major progress in this area. The tools applied include genome-wide association studies encompassing >200,000 individuals complemented by bioinformatic approaches, including 1000 Genomes imputation, expression quantitative trait locus analyses, and interrogation of Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, Roadmap, and other data sets. close to 60 common SNPs (minor allele frequency>0.05) associated with CAD risk and reaching genome-wide significance (P<5 Ã— 10(-8)) have been identified. Furthermore, a total of 202 independent signals in 109 loci have achieved a false discovery rate (q<0.05) and together explain 28% of the estimated heritability of CAD. These data have been used successfully to create genetic risk scores that can improve risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors and identify those individuals who will benefit most from statin therapy. Such information also has important applications in clinical medicine and drug discovery by using a Mendelian randomization approach to interrogate the causal nature of many factors found to associate with CAD risk in epidemiological studies. In contrast to genome-wide association studies, whole-exome sequencing has provided valuable information directly relevant to genes with known roles in plasma lipoprotein metabolism but has, thus far, failed to identify other rare coding variants linked to CAD. Overall, recent studies have led to a broader understanding of the genetic architecture of CAD and demonstrate that it largely derives from the cumulative effect of multiple common risk alleles individually of small effect size rather than rare variants with large effects on CAD risk. Despite this success, there has been limited progress in understanding the function of the novel loci; the majority of which are in noncoding regions of the genome.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruth McPherson"", ids = ""2396313"");

7bc0ecd5248cae4bafc8f1b92c2eba24af3f8292,Next Generation Sequencing Analysis of Human Platelet PolyA+ mRNAs and rRNA-Depleted Total RNA,"BACKGROUND
Platelets are small anucleate cells circulating in the blood vessels where they play a key role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Here, we compared platelet RNA-Seq results obtained from polyA+ mRNA and rRNA-depleted total RNA.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used purified, CD45 depleted, human blood platelets collected by apheresis from three male and one female healthy blood donors. The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was employed to sequence cDNA converted either from oligo(dT) isolated polyA+ RNA or from rRNA-depleted total RNA. The reads were aligned to the GRCh37 reference assembly with the TopHat/Cufflinks alignment package using Ensembl annotations. A de novo assembly of the platelet transcriptome using the Trinity software package and RSEM was also performed. The bioinformatic tools HTSeq and DESeq from Bioconductor were employed for further statistical analyses of read counts.


RESULTS
Consistent with previous findings our data suggests that mitochondrially expressed genes comprise a substantial fraction of the platelet transcriptome. We also identified high transcript levels for protein coding genes related to the cytoskeleton function, chemokine signaling, cell adhesion, aggregation, as well as receptor interaction between cells. Certain transcripts were particularly abundant in platelets compared with other cell and tissue types represented by RNA-Seq data from the Illumina Human Body Map 2.0 project. Irrespective of the different library preparation and sequencing protocols, there was good agreement between samples from the 4 individuals. Eighteen differentially expressed genes were identified in the two sexes at 10% false discovery rate using DESeq.


CONCLUSION
The present data suggests that platelets may have a unique transcriptome profile characterized by a relative over-expression of mitochondrially encoded genes and also of genomic transcripts related to the cytoskeleton function, chemokine signaling and surface components compared with other cell and tissue types. The in vivo functional significance of the non-mitochondrial transcripts remains to be shown.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Antheia Kissopoulou"", ids = ""3799949""); list(name = ""Jon A.

After kernel smoothing of the tag counts over the genome, the presence of a peak is tested at each observed local maximum, followed by multiple testing correction at the desired false discovery rate level. Valid p-values for candidate peaks are computed via Monte Carlo simulations of smoothed Poisson sequences, whose background Poisson rates are obtained via linear regression from a Control sample and the local GC content. The proposed method resolves nearby binding sites that other methods do not.",2016,,"list(name = ""Armin Schwartzman"", ids = ""46676238""); list(name = ""Andrew H.

e81107a7fc63513f3c23a88ce88c19b0dfb2d77a,Genome-Wide Associations of Chlorophyll Fluorescence OJIP Transient Parameters Connected With Soil Drought Response in Barley,"One hundred and nine accessions of spring barley seedlings were phenotyped under soil drought conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence induction (OJIP) parameters, leaf water content, relative turgidity, net assimilation rate (P N), and water use efficiency (WUE) of plants were measured. All the tested lines were genotyped by means of DArT sequencing (DArTseq) technology. For association mapping a 11,780 polymorphic DArTseq and 4,725 DArTseq SNP markers were used. Our results revealed dissimilar patterns of the relationships between OJIP-parameters under control and drought conditions. A high level of correlation between parameters characterizing Photosystem's II (PSII) energy trapping efficiency (Fv/Fm) and photochemical events downstream of PSII reaction center (e.g., Performance Index-PICSo) was observed only in the case of drought-treated plants. Generally, OJIP parameters were correlated with leaf water content (less in control). This correlation was weaker with WUE, and absent with P N. Under drought stress, 6,252 genotype Ã— phenotype associations, which passed false discovery rate (FDR) verification, were found between all the studied phenotypic characteristics (23, including 19 OJIP parameters) and 2,721 markers. On the other hand, only 282 associations passed FDR test in the control. They comprised 22 phenotypic parameters and 205 markers. Probing for gene annotations of sequences was performed for markers associated with Fv/Fm for both drought and control, markers were associated with studied traits in both control and drought, as well as for markers associated with both OJIP and other physiological parameters in drought.

The principal aim of this package is to implement SGoF-type multiple testing methods, known to be more powerful than the classical false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error rate (FWER) based methods in certain situations, particularly when the number of tests is large. This package includes Binomial and Conservative SGoF and the Bayesian and Beta-Binomial SGoF multiple testing procedures, which are adaptations of the original SGoF method to the Bayesian setting and to possibly correlated tests, respectively. The sgof package also implements the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR controlling procedures. For each method the package provides (among other things) the number of rejected null hypotheses, estimation of the corresponding FDR, and the set of adjusted p values. Some automatic plots of interest are implemented too.

71eabe7742d69a5f2a74c1a83a1b737fcefa7136,Genetic factors for lone atrial fibrillation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) may result from an electric conduction disturbance, increased hemodynamic stress, ischemia, inflammation, or remodeling in atria. Although genetic epidemiological studies have identified several genetic variants as risk factors for AF, the genetic determinants of this condition remain largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to lone AF. The study population comprised 1069 unrelated Japanese individuals, including 196 subjects with chronic lone AF and 873 controls. The genotypes for 40 polymorphisms of 32 candidate genes were determined by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and the prevalence of smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperchole-sterolemia as well as a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that the -1306C-->T polymorphism of the matrix metalloproteinase 2 gene (MMP2) and the -592A-->C polymorphism of the interleukin 10 gene (IL10) were significantly (false discovery rate of <0.05) associated with the prevalence of AF. The T allele of the MMP2 polymorphism and the C allele of the IL10 polymorphism were a risk factor for and protective factor against AF, respectively. Determination of the genotypes for these polymorphisms may thus prove informative for assessment of the genetic component of AF.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Takeshi Hibino"", ids = ""4383355""); list(name = ""Kazuhiro Yajima"", ids = ""144739394""); list(name = ""Hitoshi Matsuo"", ids = ""145470407""); list(name = ""Tomonori Segawa"", ids = ""5485806""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",9d7a4ffdffc2c34271cdf72207ac8bcde2110145; fc3c524a77e2dbc98f5f7a105e41316b49a53351; 5ce16ae3404d52971147d33585e3c514a87784a3; f1c68deade252fe58920723639fb5853de1320e5; 6596c635a0582b3091cfbea44146deb5e249af3d; f073f6ad682f2598f7a0e21aeaf7837f15e2af96; 3f3bb61bea1664462cf60572e10fb04ef3d5032d; 04ace1e67035784194485ce6b312065f42ff7c16; 0cc6c99d143f827abedfd1a37cc04a6ad0a01677; d494352fa8e215e7edb70b8966dccf7c413d8aeb; 8871bf23b9f13784a873dca1d8a2efca0608105e; 44ca2a94e3fa6695fe90605e15346d543f89ad09; 820c3272e004cce7807cd18cafd1a29cb654f6b3; 25f7c388249756bc044af2c6dc8df4badf52f439; 3c107f8e332724ded01f637921401e6672d36ff0; 5e16adb5d4bfbd8262ebbe5a1e965410cd6d15af; 80ffe4d794b14826de91a9902f1fba0887e12521; 0345b2f055b006c87f2022cd3480ec4305266284; 7745b2804812ef08fc01ed094b473f7bcf6f871f; 755ef2316d84e18d1d699fca5ec1101abc58cabd; 526cb136b0e2084a3e91059e43686d28ff93585c; 334e83e8efa14aec14fb84ad26a78fda28c4092c; dba4cd17dbb294fd61b55f9afb54e943e7959319; 1e8d08db6d0be3d12708e120653837757e192afa; 7547176bf35f7d7d2aa2ac292706de6ccca05bc9; 2dea123ebf812df2d6e98303840f8a200c708441; 2dcc3623458b213ab8f1ae09775b96019e274e1d; 3e3ea08a9e56748d91b416680f231894456c0207; fbc8828c154f2d7782859479841362d7040e3313; b89f7e316bed8495e82b10d355077661c6fb42bd; 31b78e2382881506aa5d4b7cee2d81395fadca22,3cd84c76f6b6698468d28292c024e9fb431a95fc; 580278e6732a5eb955eb37a67fae96f94bda8c24; 7b2bbaeea9b55eddcbef8155039a05fd1ed3b6f6; 72e4d69e9e7ac018743d522f06ec4bced606b89f; 20d7584d07471d3df7e8d09083bc929b6c351e4d; 157e7dd1246f06e32ead3e7961ca080cb40783af; 2dab36d4a58021ee17dc2e0886bff0b5e5878c7e; 3d1dcd46964cf31f78d520a07a77ae60a48c15f6; dc8497570b4f43355ad99b9b40c41accee4bb275; 312ccbdef770d3a1bc4025519cbe6dda212d4c99; 95beb76dacb1cb0530ad28273c1422073928e3c9; c93759e07eb8164110c1e6ee0501c16d4efaf7e4; c08997ad19083e65156602a3835bac711ccef734; fd671723ea64a0fdfc216d09197e887972104744; 5e927522cb65e7aa2791ccb492d21b608164bc12; d1e1728f9816ab31166fdf499b97765288addb7d; f89826a8883522da5971a7e1c7513301a9be00b3; 5d55f2151522b2901f48db5c4b02b88c9742dd8b; 5359c486f63a42b0b35a2d02263d2ff4489f985d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 02da197984eddc9e5adb19e476f851f1acf139ff; dbda9190ef1671184fe554147eb0b9b0b61f2510; 85fcb1d8fa77f5058892854da6952bc686812f05; 13786bc5e832854bbe71816487dd7d998e68768a; 269f92bd009492a5bd89972d8cf0bcca4613ad9a; 215002ea8b8bff7b15a4537099561e3c157a546b; 386b52e70068be25e32a05d399883b63858d6742; 9a631dd21d495fe27c7ea700d90cdfd0a22f2f33; fb3a4205e6475bea2e5fca8396e3dcfa99f39f34; c6dc970d21791b4861a6a3a85b0bc3695c344442; 56c65d7036cf36f50b09a195c592aa11d221a7ca; 768d847d3281e57c9213bfa9abeb9a40de2e1bb5; 5f742a6aa5c3f5748a1d616194278933cf2b8653; 3072b23c2d7d1c511d7b9220a34711885b5281d4; d92c32259e1c3f59056e88bd01474d98ead4ed88; e6c8ba55274022fc6bd1c1f0f2b827fd552cbf92; a6d854dbf574e0065b267967101bd00b0933fb8d; 82a4e5163c36e5b6f5ba58025d2e8722c6392b50; 99be9d57786afac00e891ba887db3e721cbed937,International journal of molecular medicine,19 6,"

4b4adae0e30e3edd38313156ad8ecdbe62646df1,Implementation and applications of gas chromatography/ atmospheric pressure chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in metabolomics,"With the commercial introduction of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization for gas chromatography in 2008, GC-APCI coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-HRTOFMS) became an interesting addition to the metabolomics toolbox. APCI is a soft ionization technique and its application to hyphenate GC to high resolution MS opens up promising new means for the identification of unknown signals in complex matrices. The actual utility of GC-APCI-HRTOFMS in metabolic fingerprinting and profiling applications to biological matrices is the topic of this doctoral thesis. 
During comparison of GC-APCI-HRTOFMS with GCÃ—GC-EI-TOFMS, GC-EI-TOFMS, GC-CI-qMS, and GC-EI-qMS in my master thesis, it was noticed that reproducibility of APCI was affected greatly by differences in humidity in the laboratory. Therefore, the impact of humidity in the APCI source on ionization efficiency and repeatability was systematically studied in the initial project of this doctoral thesis. Water was continuously infused to ensure a constant humidity during APCI in the analysis of methylchloroformate (MCF)- and methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MeOx-TMS) derivatized metabolites. These two different derivatization strategies are most commonly pursued in GC-MS based metabolome analyses. Several infusion rates were tested and a rate of 0.4 mL/h yielded an average 16.6-fold increase in intensity of the protonated molecules ([M+H]+) of 20 MCF-derivatized metabolites through suppression of in-source fragmentation. Water infusion, however, did not improve efficiency and repeatability of APCI of methoxime-trimethylsilyl (MeOx-TMS) derivatives of metabolite standards. Then, the impact of water infusion on metabolic fingerprinting of biological specimens was investigated. Water infusion led to a marked increase in the number of metabolites identified in MCF-derivatized cancer cell extracts via their [M+H]+ ions and improved repeatability of peak areas, almost doubling the number (N=23) of identified, significantly regulated metabolites (false discovery rate <0.05) between controls and cancer cells treated with the heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor 17-DMAG. 
Next, matrix effects caused by co-eluting compounds were investigated that might influence ionization. Strikingly, recovery of three out of seven internal standards used in a spike-in experiment was below 75% in one or several of the three biological matrices tested, namely Escherichia coli extract, serum, and urine. This was due to suppression by their respective endogenous metabolite that was present at a high concentration. Ion suppression caused by a co-eluting compound was further shown for three pairs of co-eluting standards employing standard mixtures with increasing concentrations of the co-eluting compounds. Overall these experiments demonstrated that matrix effects have to be taken into consideration in GC-APCI-MS. 
In the course of my doctoral thesis, Bruker Daltonics (Bremen, Germany) introduced a redesigned APCI source. To test the capabilities of this source, MeOx-TMS derivatized supernatants of untreated cancer cells were analyzed by GC-APCI-HRTOFMS using both the original APCI I and the redesigned APCI II source. The latter source almost doubled the number of spectral features with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 that could be extracted from metabolite fingerprints and increased the absolute number of identified metabolites by 33% from 36 to 48. In addition, the median area RSDs of extracted features decreased from 33% to 24%. These improvements further resulted in a more than fourfold median decrease in lower limits of quantification to 0.002 - 3.91 ÂµM as evidenced for 20 MeOx-TMS derivatized metabolite standards and a concomitant increase in the linear range by 0.5 to almost three orders of magnitude. 
Finally, GC-APCI(II)-HRTOFMS was applied to the enantioselective quantitative profil-ing of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). MCF derivatization and GC analysis on a chiral gamma-cyclodextrin (Rt-rDEXsa) column were used to separate the D from the L enantiomer of 2-HG. Separation was optimized to avoid co-elution of D-2-HG with a highly abundant matrix compound present in cell culture media supplemented with bovine serum albumin. The use of APCI-HRTOFMS yielded highly specific quantifier ions and the infusion of water enhanced lower limits of quantification and repeatability by factors of ten and two, respectively. Analysis of a racemic 2-HG standard after MCF derivatization yielded a total of four peaks instead of the expected two signals for the D- and L-enantiomer. It was then shown that in addition to an open-chain three-fold derivative of 2-HG the methyl ester of the D/L-2-HG lactone is formed during derivatization. Since lactone of D/L-2-HG was found to be naturally present in biological specimens, the developed method was eventually based on the open-chain three-fold derivative of 2-HG yielding LLOQ values of 0.49 ÂµM (D-2-HG) and 0.24 ÂµM (L-2-HG). The GC-APCI(II)-HRTOFMS approach was successfully applied to the determination of D/L-2-HG concentration levels in urine specimens of 23 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 6 healthy controls, which were validated by HPLC-MS/MS. The yet to be discovered source of 2-HG lactone in sera of AML patients carrying neomorphic isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations promises to shed new light on the pathogenesis and progression of AML.
In summary this doctoral thesis demonstrates that GC-APCI-HRTOFMS is a useful addition to the established GC-MS approaches in metabolomics. Studies on factors potentially influencing the ionization, namely water infusion, matrix effects and source type, distinctly widened the applicability of GC-APCI-HRTOFMS for qualitative and quantitative analysis of MeOx-TMS and MCF derivatized metabolites. The ability of APCI along with water infusion to efficiently ionize a broad range of MCF metabolites was proven and in the following applied to comparative metabolic fingerprinting in extracts of treated cancer cells. Finally, the outstanding quantitative capabilities of GC-APCI(II)-HRTOFMS were used in a first enantioselective profiling application for quantitative determination of the oncometabolite D-2-HG. Altogether, this doctoral thesis contributed significantly to the excellent progress GC-APCI-MS has made towards becoming a routine tool in metabolomics.",2015,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Christian J.

e42c9f10195767a1fb0da5810faadb30153b211e,Application of serum proteomics to the Women's Health Initiative conjugated equine estrogens trial reveals a multitude of effects relevant to clinical findings,"BackgroundThe availability of serum collections from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) randomized controlled trial provides an opportunity to test the potential of in-depth quantitative proteomics to uncover changes in the serum proteome related to CEE and to assess their relevance to trial findings, including elevations in the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism and a reduction in fractures.MethodsFive independent large scale quantitative proteomics analyses were performed, each comparing a set of pooled serum samples collected from 10 subjects, 1 year following initiation of CEE at 0.625 mg/d, relative to their baseline pool. A subset of proteins that exhibited increased levels with CEE by quantitative proteomics was selected for validation studies.ResultsOf 611 proteins quantified based on differential stable isotope labeling, the levels of 116 (19%) were changed after 1 year of CEE (nominal P < 0.05), while 64 of these had estimated false discovery rates <0.05. Most of the changed proteins were not previously known to be affected by CEE and had relevance to processes that included coagulation, metabolism, osteogenesis, inflammation, and blood pressure maintenance. To validate quantitative proteomic data, 14 proteins were selected for ELISA. Findings for ten - IGF1, IGFBP4, IGFBP1, IGFBP2, F10, AHSG, GC, CP, MMP2, and PROZ - were confirmed in the initial set of 50 subjects and further validated in an independent set of 50 additional subjects who received CEE.ConclusionsCEE affected a substantial fraction of the serum proteome, including proteins with relevance to findings from the WHI CEE trial related to cardiovascular disease and fracture.Clinical Trials RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00000611",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hiroyuki Katayama"", ids = ""1756515""); list(name = ""Sophie Paczesny"", ids = ""4349398""); list(name = ""Ross L.

Current non-invasive diagnostics for acute myocardial infarction (MI) identify myocardial necrosis rather than the primary cause and therapeutic target-plaque disruption and resultant thrombosis. The aim of this study was to identify changes specific to plaque disruption and pathological thrombosis that are distinct from acute myocardial necrosis.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We quantified 1,032 plasma metabolites by mass spectrometry in 11 thrombotic MI, 12 non-thrombotic MI, and 15 stable coronary artery disease (CAD) subjects at two acute phase (time of catheterization [T0], six hours [T6]) and one quiescent (>3 months follow-up) time points. A statistical classifier was constructed utilizing baseline (T0) abundances of a parsimonious set of 17 qualifying metabolites. Qualifying metabolites were those that demonstrated a significant change between the quiescent phase and the acute phase and that were distinct from any change seen in non-thrombotic MI or stable CAD subjects. Classifier performance as estimated by 10-fold cross-validation was suggestive of high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating thrombotic from non-thrombotic MI and stable CAD subjects at presentation. Nineteen metabolites demonstrated an intra-subject change from time of acute thrombotic MI presentation to the quiescent state that was distinct from any change measured in both the non-thrombotic MI and stable CAD subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization over the same time course (false discovery rate <5%).


CONCLUSIONS
We have identified a candidate metabolic signature that differentiates acute thrombotic MI from quiescent state after MI, from acute non-thrombotic MI, and from stable CAD. Further validation of these metabolites is warranted given their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of acute MI.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew P.

50046ba1351def16cbb1cf61453eb280aaa7cd7a,A microarray gene expression study of the molecular pharmacology of lithium carbonate on mouse brain mRNA to understand the neurobiology of mood stabilization and treatment of bipolar affective disorder.,"OBJECTIVES
Lithium is the most widely prescribed and effective mood-stabilizing drug used for the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. To understand how lithium produces changes in the brain, we studied brain mRNA from 10 mice after treatment with lithium and compared them with 10 untreated controls.


METHODS
We used the MAS 5.0, Smudge miner, GC-RMA and FDR-AME packages of software (Bioconductor, Seattle, Washington, USA) to determine gene expression changes using Affymetrix MOE430E 2.0 microarrays after 2 weeks of lithium treatment.


RESULTS
We used both a false discovery rate (FDR-AME) assessment of significance and the Bonferroni method to correct for the possibility of false-positive changes in gene expression among the 39,000 genes present in each array. Our primary method of analysis was to use t-tests on normalized gene expression intensities. By using a Bonferroni correction of P<1.28x10(-6), we found that 121 genes showed significant changes in expression. The three genes with the most changed mRNA expression were alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2-like 1 (Agxt2l1), c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (Mertk) and sulfotransferase family 1A phenol-preferring member 1 (Sult1a1). Also among the group of 121 genes with significant changes in gene expression that survived Bonferroni correction () were the genes encoding the Per2 period gene (Per2 P=1.33x10(-8), 2.47-fold change), the metabotropic glutamate receptor (Grm3, P=9.48x10(-7), 0.7-fold change) and secretogranin II (Scg2, P=9.48x10(-7), 1.28-fold change) as well as several myelin-related genes and protein phosphatases. By taking a significance value of P<0.05 without Bonferroni or FDR-AME correction, we identified a total of 4474 genes showing changed mRNA expression in response to lithium. FDR-AME analysis showed that 1027 out of these 4474 genes were significantly changed in expression. Among the mRNAs that were significantly changed with t-tests and FDR-AME were several that had already been implicated in response to lithium such as increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA ( t-test P=0.0008-0.0005, FDR-AME P=0.0396-0.0393, 1.44-fold change) beta-phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Pitpnb, t-test P<0.0000, FDR-AME P=0.003, 1.26-fold change) and inositol (myo)-1(or 4)-monophosphatase 1(Impa1, t test P<0.0000, FDR-AME P=0.004, 1.22-fold change). Of interest in relation to the side effect of hypothyroidism, which is caused by long-term lithium treatment was the fact that we observed changes in mRNA expression in five genes related to thyroxine metabolism. These included deiodinase (Dio2 t-test P=0.000003-0.004, FDR-AME P=0.0048-0.061, 1.53-fold change) and thyroid hormone receptor interactor 12 (Trip12, t-test P=0.003, FDR-AME P=0.075, 1.19-fold change). Of relevance to multiple sclerosis was the observed upregulation of the long isoform of myelin basic protein (t-test P=0.00013, FDR-AME P=0.0169). Changes in mRNA expression were found in 45 genes related to phosphatidylinositol metabolism using uncorrected t-tests but only 13 genes after FDR-AME. Thus, our work confirms the considerable previous research implicating this system. Gene ontology analysis showed that lithium significantly affected a cluster of processes associated with nucleotide and nucleoside metabolism. The analysis showed that there were 170 genes expressing RNA described as having ATP-binding or ATPase activity that had changed mRNA expression. The changes found have been discussed in relation to previous experimental work on the pharmacology of lithium.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew McQuillin"", ids = ""38170553""); list(name = ""Mie A Rizig"", ids = ""4279036"");

We introduce a general condition, called "" self-consistency "" , on the set of hypotheses rejected by the procedure, which we show is sufficient to ensure the control of the corresponding false discovery rate under various conditions on the distribution of the p-values. Maximizing the size of the rejected null hypotheses set under the constraint of self-consistency, we recover various step-up procedures. As a consequence, we recover earlier results through simple and unifying proofs while extending their scope to several regards: arbitrary measure of set size, p-value reweighting, new family of step-up procedures under unspecified p-value dependency. Our framework also allows for defining and studying FDR control for multiple testing procedures over a continuous, uncountable space of hypotheses.",2008,,"list(name = ""Gilles Blanchard"", ids = ""145945278""); list(name = ""Ã‰tienne Roquain"", ids = ""50259561"")",,f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 60b34d6721c7fd8237de116314e51a8347f2c1ac; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 7c8ab4825e0d59ab38c0790a8ca7ee81edfe9e4b; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc,,,
a00e381fc8a0da952d04f8e52b135c6066d6ea1d,A nutrient-wide association study for risk of prostate cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition and the Netherlands Cohort Study,"The evidence from the literature regarding the association of dietary factors and risk of prostate cancer is inconclusive. A nutrient-wide association study was conducted to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the associations between 92 foods or nutrients and risk of prostate cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for total energy intake, smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, diabetes and education were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for standardized dietary intakes. As in genome-wide association studies, correction for multiple comparisons was applied using the false discovery rate (FDRâ€‰<â€‰5%) method and suggested results were replicated in an independent cohort, the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS). A total of 5916 and 3842 incident cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 14 and 20 years in EPIC and NLCS, respectively. None of the dietary factors was associated with the risk of total prostate cancer in EPIC (minimum FDR-corrected P, 0.37). Null associations were also observed by disease stage, grade and fatality, except for positive associations observed for intake of dry cakes/biscuits with low-grade and butter with aggressive prostate cancer, respectively, out of which the intake of dry cakes/biscuits was replicated in the NLCS. Our findings provide little support for an association for the majority of the 92 examined dietary factors and risk of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods This case-control study was approved by the local research ethics committee, and all participants provided informed consent. There were 153 right-handed patients with PD and 81 healthy control participants recruited who were matched for age, sex, and handedness to undergo a 3-T resting-state functional MR examination. The whole-brain functional connectome was constructed by thresholding the Pearson correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and the topologic properties were analyzed by using graph theory approaches. Nonparametric permutation tests were used to compare topologic properties, and their relationship to disease severity was assessed. Results The functional connectome in PD showed abnormalities at the global level (ie, decrease in clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and local efficiency, and increase in characteristic path length) and at the nodal level (decreased nodal centralities in the sensorimotor cortex, default mode, and temporal-occipital regions; P < .001, false discovery rate corrected). Further, the nodal centralities in left postcentral gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus correlated negatively with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score (P = .038, false discovery rate corrected, r = -0.198; and P = .009, false discovery rate corrected, r = -0.270, respectively) and decreased with increasing Hoehn and Yahr stage in patients with PD. Conclusion The configurations of brain functional connectome in patients with PD were perturbed and correlated with disease severity, notably with those responsible for motor functions. These results provide topologic insights into understanding the neural functional changes in relation to disease severity of PD.

d7da88bd48ae1f5241cde6131b3bc1e0ff841682,2429-PUB: Circulating microRNAs Are Associated with Glycemic Variability over a 12-Month Period,"Introduction: Circulating microRNAs (miRs) function as mediators of biological responses to the environment and may provide insights into mechanisms for type 2 diabetes (T2D). A limitation of prior studies is their cross-sectional design. We sought to characterize variability in fasting blood glucose (FBG) at 5 time-points over a 12-month period in order to determine whether FBG variability was associated with circulating miR expression and identify miR-associated biological pathways. Methods: Participants were from a previously completed trial on restorative yoga for overweight/obese adults with prediabetes. FBG variability was defined using the standard deviation across 5 time-points. A subset of participants with high (n=10) vs. low (n=10) FBG variability, matched by age and sex, were evaluated. Expression of 336 miRs collected at baseline was measured with the Fireplex Circulating MicroRNA assay. False discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.2 was applied. The miRPathDB database was used to identify KEGG pathways. Results: A total of 6 miRs (i.e., miR-192, miR-197, miR-206, miR-424, miR-486, miR-93) were differentially expressed between individuals with highly compared to low FBG variability. For the six miRs identified in both batches, 321 KEGG pathways were targeted. The Insulin signaling pathway was targeted by miR-197, miR-206, miR-424, and miR-486; the Insulin secretion pathway was targeted by miR-486; and the type 2 diabetes mellitus pathway was targeted by miR-197, miR-206, miR-424, and miR-486. Conclusions: Circulating miRs are associated with variability in FBG and miRs target pathways that are known to underlie risk for T2D. The immediate next step is to perform longitudinal analysis of the relationships between FBG and circulating miRs to explore novel pathway targets to derive new insights about mechanisms for T2D.

59800e57da3426ad158d885a3f8ee20931a4b7bf,Ribosome profiling uncovers selective mRNA translation associated with eIF2 phosphorylation in erythroid progenitors,"The regulation of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is important for erythroid survival and differentiation. Lack of iron, a critical component of heme and hemoglobin, activates Heme Regulated Inhibitor (HRI). This results in phosphorylation of eIF2 and reduced eIF2 availability, which inhibits protein synthesis. Translation of specific transcripts such as Atf4, however, is enhanced. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are key to this regulation. The aim of this study is to investigate how eIF2 phosphorylation affects mRNA translation in erythroblasts. Ribosome profiling combined with RNA sequencing was used to determine translation initiation sites and ribosome density on individual transcripts. Treatment of erythroblasts with Tunicamycin (Tm) increased phosphorylation of eIF2 2-fold. At a false discovery rate of 1%, ribosome density was increased for 147 transcripts, among which transcriptional regulators such as Atf4, Tis7/Ifrd1, Pnrc2, Gtf2h, Mbd3, JunB and Kmt2e. Translation of 337 transcripts decreased more than average, among which Dym and Csde1. Ribosome profiling following Harringtonine treatment uncovered novel translation initiation sites and uORFs. Surprisingly, translated uORFs did not predict eIF2-dependent translation efficiency, but uORF identity differs. The regulation of transcription and translation factors in reponse to eIF2 phosphorylation may explain the large overall response to iron deficiency in erythroblasts. - eif2 dependent translation in erythroblasts during proteotoxic stress determined by ribosome footprinting - identification of transcription factors upregulated in response to eIF2 phosphorylation - Advantages and disadvantages of translation initiation site determination using harringtonine - distinct uORF pattern in transcripts with enhanced, or more than average reduced translation upon proteotoxic stress",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Nahuel A.

Results We present a novel pipeline (CamCNV) with a series of steps to reduce noise and detect more reliably rare CNVs covering as few as three probes. The method uses the information from all samples to convert intensities to z-scores, thus adjusting for variance between probes. We tested the sensitivity of our pipeline by looking for known CNVs from the 1000 Genomes project in our genotyping of 1000 Genomes samples. We also compared the CNV calls for 1,661 pairs of genotyped replicate samples. At the chosen mean z-score cut-off, sensitivity to detect the 1000 Genomes CNVs was approximately 85% for deletions and 65% for duplications. From the replicates we estimate the false discovery rate is controlled at âˆ¼10% for deletions (falling to below 3% with more than five probes) and âˆ¼28% for duplications. The pipeline demonstrates improved sensitivity when compared to calling with PennCNV, particularly for short deletions covering only a few probes Conclusion The CamCNV pipeline provides a reliable method of detecting rare CNVs from Illumina array data and can be used for CNVs that only cover a few probes. For each called CNV the mean z-score is a useful metric for controlling the false discovery rate.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Joe Dennis"", ids = ""1762925""); list(name = ""Logan C Walker"", ids = ""144165813""); list(name = ""Jonathan P.

27aced0bb7f24332905d31f89ffeeb8b6549c3be,Adjusted Confidence Intervals for the Expression Change of Proteins Observed in 2-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis,"Differential proteome analyses focus on the detection and quantification of expression changes between samples from different biological groups. While the significance of an expression change is detected by some statistical test, the strength of an expression change is usually quantified by some ratio estimate, e.g. the â€˜fold changeâ€™. Due to its quantitative character, the fold change is more intuitively for biologists than the decision of a statistical test. However, strong expression changes are often misleading if this change is not significant. For this reason, we propose the employment of confidence intervals, adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing, which naturally comprise both, test decision and quantification. The adjusted confidence intervals can be used for making test decisions under the control of error rates typically considered in multiple hypotheses testing (e.g. the familywise error rate or the false discovery rate). For biologists, test decisions based on adjusted confidence intervals offer a more intuitive method for selecting proteins with a significant expression change between two groups. The length of the intervals can be used for sample size planning of upcoming experiments. Our approach is primarily addressed to protein expression data recorded by two-dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Klaus Jung"", ids = ""144268096""); list(name = ""Gereon Poschmann"", ids = ""50572752""); list(name = ""Katharina Podwojski"", ids = ""46881443""); list(name = ""Martin Eisenacher"", ids = ""145677256""); list(name = ""Michael Kohl"", ids = ""49913893""); list(name = ""Kathy Pfeiffer"", ids = ""50678732""); list(name = ""Helmut E.

Objective: We sought to determine differential gene and protein expression in sputum samples from patients with severe asthma (SA) compared with nonsmoking patients with mild/moderate asthma. Methods: Induced sputum was obtained from nonsmoking patients with SA, smokers/exâ€smokers with severe asthma, nonsmoking patients with mild/moderate asthma (MMAs), and healthy nonsmoking control subjects. Differential cell counts, microarray analysis of cell pellets, and SOMAscan analysis of sputum analytes were performed. CRID3 was used to inhibit the inflammasome in a mouse model of SA. Results: Eosinophilic and mixed neutrophilic/eosinophilic inflammation were more prevalent in patients with SA compared with MMAs. Fortyâ€two genes probes were upregulated (>2â€fold) in nonsmoking patients with severe asthma compared with MMAs, including ILâ€1 receptor (ILâ€1R) family and nucleotideâ€binding oligomerization domain, leucineâ€rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NRLP3) inflammasome members (false discovery rate < 0.05). The inflammasome proteins nucleotideâ€binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1), NLRP3, and nucleotideâ€binding oligomerization domain (NOD)â€like receptor C4 (NLRC4) were associated with neutrophilic asthma and with sputum ILâ€1&bgr; protein levels, whereas eosinophilic asthma was associated with an ILâ€13â€“induced TH2 signature and ILâ€1 receptorâ€“like 1 (IL1RL1) mRNA expression. These differences were sputum specific because no activation of NLRP3 or enrichment of ILâ€1R family genes in bronchial brushings or biopsy specimens in patients with SA was observed. Expression of NLRP3 and of the ILâ€1R family genes was validated in the Airway Disease Endotyping for Personalized Therapeutics cohort. Inflammasome inhibition using CRID3 prevented airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation (both neutrophilia and eosinophilia) in a mouse model of severe allergic asthma. Conclusion: IL1RL1 gene expression is associated with eosinophilic SA, whereas NLRP3 inflammasome expression is highest in patients with neutrophilic SA. TH2â€driven eosinophilic inflammation and neutrophilâ€associated inflammasome activation might represent interacting pathways in patients with SA.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christos Rossios"", ids = ""5186677""); list(name = ""Stelios Pavlidis"", ids = ""34335382""); list(name = ""Uruj Hoda"", ids = ""15824080""); list(name = ""Chih-Hsi Scott Kuo"", ids = ""33769628""); list(name = ""Coen H Wiegman"", ids = ""3628106""); list(name = ""Kirsty E.

8ebcf19554a164f3910fbe1612e41296d0718769,A Highly Predictive Model for Diagnosis of Colorectal Neoplasms Using Plasma MicroRNA: Improving Specificity and Sensitivity.,"OBJECTIVE
To develop a plasma-based microRNA (miRNA) diagnostic assay specific for colorectal neoplasms, building upon our prior work.


BACKGROUND
Colorectal neoplasms [colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal advanced adenoma (CAA)] frequently develop in individuals at ages when other common cancers also occur. Current screening methods lack sensitivity, specificity, and have poor patient compliance.


METHODS
Plasma was screened for 380 miRNAs using microfluidic array technology from a ""Training"" cohort of 60 patients, (10 each) control, CRC, CAA, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. We identified uniquely dysregulated miRNAs specific for colorectal neoplasia (P < 0.05, false discovery rate: 5%, adjusted Î± = 0.0038). These miRNAs were evaluated using single assays in a ""Test"" cohort of 120 patients. A mathematical model was developed to predict blinded sample identity in a 150 patient ""Validation"" cohort using repeat-sub-sampling validation of the testing dataset with 1000 iterations each to assess model detection accuracy.


RESULTS
Seven miRNAs (miR-21, miR-29c, miR-122, miR-192, miR-346, miR-372, and miR-374a) were selected based upon P value, area under the curve (AUC), fold change, and biological plausibility. Area under the curve (Â±95% confidence interval) for ""Test"" cohort comparisons were 0.91 (0.85-0.96) between all neoplasia and controls, 0.79 (0.70-0.88) between colorectal neoplasia and other cancers, and 0.98 (0.96-1.0) between CRC and colorectal adenomas. In our ""Validation"" cohort, our mathematical model predicted blinded sample identity with 69% to 77% accuracy, 67% to 76% accuracy, and 86% to 90% accuracy for each comparison, respectively.

The study of this host-pathogen model is thus essential to understand the nature of the crucial initial steps of the infection. We present here a quantitative proteomic approach to assess which proteins and biological functions and to which extent are more relatively abundant or activated upon the interaction. The experimental design, consists of an 8-plex iTRAQ experiment which enables the inclusion of three biological replicates for the ratio interaction/control and one extra replicate for the same ratio composed of respective pools for both control and interaction samples. The mass spectrometry was performed with a 4800 MALDITOF/TOF instrument and identification and quantitation were acquired using ProteinPilot 3.0 software. Applying a false discovery rate threshold of less than 5% , and taking into account only those proteins supported by three or more peptides with at least 95% confidence in identification, we obtain a good quality subset of proteins for further analysis. Those were forced to pass additional quantitation filters to reach the subset of proteins that show statistically significant changes in each of the interaction vs. control ratios. To accomplish such task we selected only those proteins showing p-values of the ratios lower than 0.05 and the Error Factor parameter, a type of confidence interval, lower than 2.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Vital VialÃ¡s"", ids = ""13532779""); list(name = ""Jose Antonio Reales-CalderÃ³n"", ids = ""1399318005""); list(name = ""Dolores GutiÃ©rrez"", ids = ""146496316""); list(name = ""Felipe Costa Clemente"", ids = ""13589278""); list(name = ""Concha Gil"", ids = ""143997532"")",,,,,121-121
64aca0e9107aaee8212e0cc0b5c9d671a0f7cdd9,Bayesian variable selection for multivariate zero-inflated models: Application to microbiome count data.,"Microorganisms play critical roles in human health and disease. They live in diverse communities in which they interact synergistically or antagonistically. Thus for estimating microbial associations with clinical covariates, such as treatment effects, joint (multivariate) statistical models are preferred. Multivariate models allow one to estimate and exploit complex interdependencies among multiple taxa, yielding more powerful tests of exposure or treatment effects than application of taxon-specific univariate analyses. Analysis of microbial count data also requires special attention because data commonly exhibit zero inflation, i.e., more zeros than expected from a standard count distribution. To meet these needs, we developed a Bayesian variable selection model for multivariate count data with excess zeros that incorporates information on the covariance structure of the outcomes (counts for multiple taxa), while estimating associations with the mean levels of these outcomes. Though there has been much work on zero-inflated models for longitudinal data, little attention has been given to high-dimensional multivariate zero-inflated data modeled via a general correlation structure. Through simulation, we compared performance of the proposed method to that of existing univariate approaches, for both the binary (""excess zero"") and count parts of the model. When outcomes were correlated the proposed variable selection method maintained type I error while boosting the ability to identify true associations in the binary component of the model. For the count part of the model, in some scenarios the univariate method had higher power than the multivariate approach. This higher power was at a cost of a highly inflated false discovery rate not observed with the proposed multivariate method. We applied the approach to oral microbiome data from the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Oral Health Study and identified five (of 44) species associated with HIV infection.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyu Ha Lee"", ids = ""2736333""); list(name = ""Brent A.

48d95d1caf60fcd2f20904cb44fd77b5d8c12d9f,Common genetic variants associated with plasma fibrin D-dimer concentration in older European- and African-American adults.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
D-dimer is a hemostasis marker that reflects ongoing fibrin formation and degradation. There is significant inter-individual and inter-population variability in D-dimer concentration, but whether genetic factors underlie these differences is largely unknown. We hypothesized that common coagulation gene variants contribute to differences in circulating D-dimer concentration.


METHODS
The setting was European-American (EA; n = 1858) and African-American (AA; n = 327) unrelated older adults from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), in which we genotyped SNPs in 42 genes related to blood coagulation and fibrinolysis.


RESULTS
Several fibrinogen gene polymorphisms, including the Thr312Ala Aalpha chain variant and the FGG-10034 C/T variant, were associated with approximately 20% higher plasma D-dimer levels in EA (false discovery rate < 5% for covariate-adjusted model). There was also some evidence that a Pro41Leu variant of the PLAU gene encoding urinary plasminogen activator and non-coding polymorphism of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene (SERPINE1) were associated with higher plasma D-dimer in EA. There were no significant associations between the studied coagulation or fibrinolysis gene SNPs and plasma D-dimer levels in the smaller AA sample. However, each standard deviation increase in European ancestry assessed by ancestry-informative gene markers was associated with approximately 10% lower mean D-dimer levels in AA.


CONCLUSIONS
Together, common coagulation/fibrinolysis gene SNPs explained only approximately 2% of the variance in plasma D-dimer levels in EA. These findings suggest that the association of D-dimer with risk of vascular outcomes may be mediated largely by environmental factors, other genes, and/or genetic interactions.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Leslie A.

9e8efd072240b6eeb6d39b82395a2ccb143d7774,Marginal false discovery rate approaches to inference on penalized regression models,"Penalized regression methods, most notably the lasso, are a popular analysis tool for data sets containing large numbers of a variables due to their ability to naturally perform variable selection. However, performing statistical inference on lasso models is difficult, making the topic an active area of research. Much of the literature on inferential methods for penalized regression models is focused exclusively on the linear regression setting, with few options available for models with categorical or survival outcomes. This dissertation proposes novel false discovery rate methods for a broad class of penalized likelihood modeling approaches that includes not only linear regression, but also generalized linear models, such as logistic regression, and survival models, such as Cox regression. The methods we propose are designed to be suitable next steps after fitting a penalized likelihood model, requiring minimal added computation or inputs other than the fitted model. The methods proposed in this dissertation deal with two broad categories of false discovery rates that exist in the large-scale hypothesis testing literature. In the first category are tail-area based approaches, which pertain to the overall false discovery rate for an entire set of rejected hypotheses. In the case of penalized regression, this is the entire set of variables active in the model. In the second category are local approaches, which refer to the specific probabilities of single variables being false discoveries, in the regression setting local approaches describe each active variable individually. Both types of false discovery rates are valuable tools depending upon the inferential question, and this dissertation proposes methods falling into both categories. In addition to making these proposals and investigating their properties using simulation, we also look at applying the methods to several case studies involving",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ryan Miller"", ids = ""47187948"")",,bfc871e0e727433cb9ad5c90bccc9291ae246f61; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 5da34d97f6319bf209cf4c9e5038104feb60568e; 351b4aaf168429940add47276adec1dfd0e8c5d4; b9f6e9ac6c1f07a1875b07791ab08a9d37936f14; 9a39e80d9bae8fb7b6b087c32e8357e2b9f101b7; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 2609cb6ea895aabbf3c38632c3b1415f6224cd75; 74a6589c40a55b75e36ebcc1fb279472b00feb2b; db4b1e3f367ddcea27d660d3316f2916bf2ba84a; e6676264d3af3604ee25f931aae78448b924fcf2; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 57a7c5db6aaab825200b85beb0bebefaee15117c; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 9c445e726cb8ca9c05312f9642c2129d8396d71b; 3b4c2ea7458cfddaf48b95e23444eaa1380b0d8a; 02c388d43f619146ef64babb4c848190e83add1b; 829b659f96771f2076ab325b1202b26085b300b4; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 739ca99bff8a2fca9330501247335b05c24b254a; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9; 59a45558657e93aed40a2f5c73bbd50a8d76dda0; b8d527eea7a492d8673d1b551208f0b0b6198182; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 078fb305820f2e2479f2c6f517524eea522373de; b800f9dde3ee805463172f38db62b79b2a8ce98a; 801f65b76e9dff94c81fe405d373ab775bd5982f; 1ba4fcafbe3e184dbd207ee5d491808a1bb42187; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; c4a98ae761034bd1b6cf8343db2a9779349478cb; a2dae138cd4ade308d0e6438bfc67c49ad422005; 86c35680190dcb1a040243927e98e4ca08f8d80e; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 10701988fecf6f2073543d584481f0380ed8913e; 72d999b37470ca58c0e7b025060e32257f667e51; e5a19a6728bff0e799f3518e0fb0354e8c3cc7d3; 6a14986b1b404f9062788e73e0dc970c9d321ff3; 3bec87a01916d25f8393a8815fc75495fcef1e97; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; c8430c5d13834e46631960469d86f7ed4577b0e2; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; 6061042a4ca90ded2ebf0a34e47a7073332bed78; 2f0f2eeff47530102a44fe683e25fc2c3db6094c; b85902e1382a799b683c3907f57c896c9497f1cb; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 50bdb364b5fa74e30422023738bbbd1e16bdab52; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; c67136ab0e52283d5b3beef23fe318eb9f455cb7,,,
581c712e657e7f8925a66d7b8c831b706c5875d7,Neural correlates of treatment outcome in major depression.,"There is a need to identify clinically useful biomarkers in major depressive disorder (MDD). In this context the functional connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to other areas of the affect regulation circuit is of interest. The aim of this study was to identify neural changes during antidepressant treatment and correlates associated with the treatment outcome. In an exploratory analysis it was investigated whether functional connectivity measures moderated a response to mirtazapine and venlafaxine. Twenty-three drug-free patients with MDD were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich. The patients were subjected to a 4-wk randomized clinical trial with two common antidepressants, venlafaxine or mirtazapine. Functional connectivity of the OFC, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging with an emotional face-matching task, was measured before and after the trial. Higher OFC connectivity with the left motor areas and the OFC regions prior to the trial characterized responders (p<0.05, false discovery rate). The treatment non-responders were characterized by higher OFC-cerebellum connectivity. The strength of response was positively correlated with functional coupling between left OFC and the caudate nuclei and thalami. Differences in longitudinal changes were detected between venlafaxine and mirtazapine treatment in the motor areas, cerebellum, cingulate gyrus and angular gyrus. These results indicate that OFC functional connectivity might be useful as a marker for therapy response to mirtazapine and venlafaxine and to reconstruct the differences in their mechanism of action.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danuta Lisiecka"", ids = ""50463897""); list(name = ""Eva M.

08fc150fb2265e5a919c22c1e1fd562f4c570fdd,Conditional Probability Based Feature Selector for Effective Data Classification,"Features play a very important role in the task of pattern classification. Consequently, the selection of suitable features is necessary as most of the raw data might be redundant or irrelevant to the recognition of patterns. In some cases, the classifier cannot perform well because of the large number of redundant features. This work presents a novel evolving feature selection algorithms taking the advantages of conditional dependency to improve the predictive accuracy. Bayes Conditional dependency approach is used to discover dependency information among features. Different features play different roles in classifying datasets. Unwanted features will result in error information during classification which will reduce classification precision. The proposed feature selection can remove these distractions to improve classification performance. As shown in the experimental results, after feature selection using the proposed method to control false discovery rate, the classification performance of Decision Tree and NaÃ¯ve Bayesian classifiers were significantly improved.",2016,,"list(name = ""Amarnath"", ids = ""88705867""); list(name = ""S.

Low glycaemic index (GI) diets benefit both maternal and neonatal gestational outcomes. We hypothesize that maternal dietary GI or glycaemic load (GL) changes during pregnancy impact placental DNA methylation, especially in insulin resistance-related genes.MethodsFrom a clinical trial of overweight pregnant women, 12 subjects who successfully reduced their GI and another 12 whose GI increased despite the intervention were selected. A genome-wide differential methylation analysis of placental tissue DNA was conducted, followed by bioinformatic annotation and validation analysis. The distribution of genome-wide differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and CpG sites was described. Six CpG sites in regulatory regions of four insulin-related genes (PLIN1, CPT1B, SSTR4, and CIDEA) were selectively validated by pyrosequencing. Pairwise Spearman correlation analysis was performed to test methylationâ€“phenotype association in an additional 153 subjects from the same trial. Correlation between methylation of significant sites and placental mRNA expression of SSTR4 was also analysed.ResultsDietary GI decreased by 24.3 (26.2â€“20.1) in the group who responded appropriately to the intervention and increased by 19.6 (15.2â€“29.1) in the comparison group. Epigenome-wide analysis identified 108 DMRs and 365 CpG sites with Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 adjusted by false discovery rate, distributed over all chromosomes. The methylation level of cg05009389 in the 3â€² UTR of PLIN1 was negatively correlated with maternal weight gain (Ïâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.21, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.027) and increase in insulin levels (Ïâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.24, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.015) during gestation. Methylation levels of cg17586860 and cg18197392 in the 5â€² UTR region of SSTR4 were negatively correlated with changes in dietary carbohydrate intake (Ïâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.24, Psâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.006) and GL across gestation (Ïâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.23, Psâ€‰â‰¤â€‰.008). This correlation survived the adjustment for maternal factors such as dietary GI, body mass index, and gestational diabetes. Up to 89% of cg18197392 methylation was explained by GL change. Cg14631053 methylation correlated positively with mRNA expression of SSTR4 in the placenta (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.20, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.037).ConclusionsWe provide the first evidence that maternal dietary GI changes during gestation may impact placental DNA methylation of insulin regulation genes. This supports the hypothesis that placental methylation may be the epigenetic mechanism through which maternal diet influences the metabolic health of offspring.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Weili Yan"", ids = ""144832138""); list(name = ""Yi Zhang"", ids = ""35099308""); list(name = ""Liping Wang"", ids = ""48169387""); list(name = ""Wenhong Yang"", ids = ""144233659""); list(name = ""Chunying Li"", ids = ""40584689""); list(name = ""Liling Wang"", ids = ""1968199""); list(name = ""Ping Gu"", ids = ""1962868""); list(name = ""Yingqian Xia"", ids = ""65729920""); list(name = ""Juhua Yan"", ids = ""9856265""); list(name = ""Ying Shen"", ids = ""143822680""); list(name = ""Qian Zhao"", ids = ""144511949""); list(name = ""Dayan Niu"", ids = ""11315724""); list(name = ""Kai Mu"", ids = ""49254862""); list(name = ""Yuan Jiang"", ids = ""41211787"")",,83ad2bcf30e4b03006b3c54c111657326613e78a; 66eef6af0b3b84151b3cdfee011e0f3a1fc13868; f3bb0b7b21529c8c9b17a8dfeaf4b5d49a1107a8; 7af209a173263da78e37dab26b71b588f976dd08; fa16dbdc0f7467f63654f41ddc36398e0b9a6f65; 9a0a7c427a96d78ca3d942cb5e1ac3f9260aae31; ee00ff3dbdb728a286c3e91e6bffc918d89609d5; 42c291112987e4b91f1eadbf13ac0afde6b7170f; 6cda9db73c12c4494207109a80c9bf563d3cbe8e; 17468f660961991d5a1b17a55f196d59ab9904ed; af6279b93ec8f3a4cb8a7adb2e53a69ffd5954a5; 6ec4373ce2c3cee78975ead1ab02e2e0e6e72fee; d34ec399dff7a572314a83466e0e5c50bffcabb4; 8585ada109d769712548f89edf5ab8c911125e2d; 3de97e99e70437fe73a9122d47be0eb773328a76; fd15c6142e95e90e6a4a40ae120bc8626761a6ee; 79befe6e24eb0b1874f67686f44b2bb4164b5a2e; cdb5099bfefd435c1ef48eb0b9bb0b43678807b4; 48599ecb5bec09e5475b9c2ff52fc7c900126307; 4867a8c13a0159911e21af637352905029d042c6; 8d3a67293ee18039f4bd579c03f255409299c41f; 9cd59bed2d737fcda75f18b3f0a3a76004ece37d; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 0cbcef849d2b1db56cf4fff9b678864e6e1f841b; b20103fed10a2e667358381b643a0cae76779e3f; 0b03726c4822ed0f9ff89375164aa869fc69d1a3; 8d4107dbfd3d30114859f33f1b7447fc8f8622f5; 881a86d518f54ec0f05a602164c35da5e8dec4d6; 754bd77b0104a42f89865e1822276984d55921d5; 1f25d69d8fa2c83ed41776ac07fa1ce0dc436f98; 128a526912a463d6ff7be69c6d26c16fbe48b222; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 04e7a36655a7daab7912da56ceca6415b87a6052; 2415d04e892acf155e5f1ca7f827551f6ac3bd06; 8f5b0b193a5af28aa0910b731e98f121baaa6f0f,Genes & Nutrition,14,

However, methodological issues, including the use of self-reported smoking status and mixed cell types have made previously identified alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression difficult to interpret. In this study, we examined associations of tobacco exposure with DNA methylation and gene expression, utilizing a biomarker of tobacco exposure (urine cotinine) and CD14+ purified monocyte samples from 934 participants of the community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Urine cotinine levels were measured using an immunoassay. DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with microarrays. Multivariate linear regression was used to test for associations adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and study site. Urine cotinine levels were associated with methylation of 176 CpGs [false discovery rate (FDR)<0.01]. Four CpGs not previously identified by studies of non-purified blood samples nominally replicated (P value<0.05) with plasma cotinine-associated methylation in 128 independent monocyte samples. Urine cotinine levels associated with expression of 12 genes (FDR<0.01), including increased expression of P2RY6 (Beta Â± standard error = 0.078 Â± 0.008, P = 1.99Â Ã— 10-22), a gene previously identified to be involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. No cotinine-associated (FDR<0.01) methylation profiles significantly (FDR<0.01) correlated with cotinine-associated (FDR<0.01) gene expression profiles. In conclusion, our findings i) identify potential monocyte-specific smoking-associated methylation patterns and ii) suggest that alterations in methylation may not be a main mechanism regulating gene expression in monocytes in response to cigarette smoking.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lindsay M Reynolds"", ids = ""34738609""); list(name = ""Kurt K.

4c1e5538be39d444cec6d16a231c4e686870bd70,Proteasome and HDAC Inhibitor Therapy in T-Cell Lymphoma (TCL) and Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL): Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2 like 2 (NRF2)-Dependent Cell Death and Function,"Background: Activation of NF-kB pathways are a hallmark feature of TCL and HL, making proteasome inhibition an attractive therapeutic target. Previous studies have demonstrated prominent in vivo efficacy of ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor for both TCL and HL. Among the common significantly regulated genes identified via systems biology approach include upregulation of genes encoding for ubiquitin proteasome subunits (Ravi et al. Cancer Res. 2016). Further combination studies with HDACi belinostat were synergistic in Jurkat, HH and L428 cell lines, and NRF2 was discovered as mediator of proteasome gene expression. We hypothesized that HDACi abrogates NRF2 mediated proteasome recovery leading to synergistic effects on cell viability in combination with ixazomib. Methods: Global transcriptome analysis was performed on RNA isolated from multiple cell lines include TCL (Jurkat) and HL (L540, L428) treated with ixazomib and control, as well as Jurkat cell lines treated with single agent ixazomib, belinostat and combination. Significant genes were determined by applying a one-way ANOVA with an adjusted Bonferroni correction for a false discovery rate (FDR) Results: Transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of proteasome genes in ixazomib treated cell lines Jurkat, L540 and L428 at 24 hours. In Jurkat TCL, ixazomib caused decreased caspase-like and chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity at 24 hours that was followed by recovery of these activities at 72 hours. The combination of ixazomib and belinostat significantly decreased proteasome activity for chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like and trypsin-like activity at 72 hours compared to single agent ixazomib or belinostat. In Jurkat cells, NRF2 was identified as a transcriptional regulator involved in proteasome gene regulation, showing upregulation of proteasomal genes and NRF2 with ixazomib single agent, downregulation with belinostat single agent and in combination with ixazomib. These results were confirmed with qPCR for NRF2 and proteasome genes in Jurkat and L428. SiRNA knockdown for NRF2 in Jurkat cells resulted in decreased cell viability, NRF2 and proteasome gene expression compared with NT SiRNA following ixazomib treatment. Conclusions: Treatment with single agent ixazomib induced prominent proteasome gene expression in all TCL and HL cell lines. In Jurkat, recovery of chymotrypsin and caspase-like proteasome activity occurred by 72 hours suggesting that transcriptional changes induced by proteasome inhibition contributed to proteasome function recovery. Combination therapy with belinostat resulted in downregulation of proteasome genes in Jurkat and L428 and prevented functional recovery of the proteasome observed in Jurkat. Our results suggest that targeting the proteasome itself with ixazomib and preventing the induced recovery of proteasome genes with belinostat contributes to synergistic effects observed on proteasome function and cell viability in TCL and HL. Further studies with CRISPR/Cas to confirm the effect of NRF2 on proteasome gene and functional recovery in the context of proteasome inhibition are ongoing and will be reported.

300ae1297ef21fd7c7a029c7911f1d04f78a6922,Penalized multimarker vs. single-marker regression methods for genome-wide association studies of quantitative traits.,"The data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans are still predominantly analyzed using single-marker association methods. As an alternative to single-marker analysis (SMA), all or subsets of markers can be tested simultaneously. This approach requires a form of penalized regression (PR) as the number of SNPs is much larger than the sample size. Here we review PR methods in the context of GWAS, extend them to perform penalty parameter and SNP selection by false discovery rate (FDR) control, and assess their performance in comparison with SMA. PR methods were compared with SMA, using realistically simulated GWAS data with a continuous phenotype and real data. Based on these comparisons our analytic FDR criterion may currently be the best approach to SNP selection using PR for GWAS. We found that PR with FDR control provides substantially more power than SMA with genome-wide type-I error control but somewhat less power than SMA with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control (SMA-BH). PR with FDR-based penalty parameter selection controlled the FDR somewhat conservatively while SMA-BH may not achieve FDR control in all situations. Differences among PR methods seem quite small when the focus is on SNP selection with FDR control. Incorporating linkage disequilibrium into the penalization by adapting penalties developed for covariates measured on graphs can improve power but also generate more false positives or wider regions for follow-up. We recommend the elastic net with a mixing weight for the Lasso penalty near 0.5 as the best method.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hui Yi"", ids = ""49511751""); list(name = ""Patrick J Breheny"", ids = ""2119683""); list(name = ""Netsanet Tewelde Imam"", ids = ""5277460""); list(name = ""Yongmei Liu"", ids = ""47909011""); list(name = ""Ina Hoeschele"", ids = ""2617129"")",b4ef47ed4677c58c32adb2f07cd72042a6824106; 3a5a32ae3f67dc45dfbf6988d2687de75ef24b92; a34b809a2d153c72b52ec136d37dace03389400d; 5816e81bb0a91485a09fbfe392d764c132328b16; f43613178b7e9eea7426f9fb3651cc924da99549; 5e834db6e1c7033bd50158742b923bbbad734bc7; 5b155f018c9169a3f02cfcbed9563d16165ec233; 8128a981d5fd0ae0ee943cac6307068bbceef1fb; 994ad149848a7392b783879e05e1c8ca3831e1d5; 57a7c5db6aaab825200b85beb0bebefaee15117c; 2272c7d3980738b54626aa52f0a58fbd26f41125; b3cdfcdfbfc8e0183dc3dbf8ee68cc8e6f819ee6; 16b255df99d3e8b4752cc971a5b7e53ba315df8d; 0882880ff44a37e200881a1836e815090eccb84b; 43088525057a7c4515634ebf21f9a542f57988c3; 4a2dd44f8e2e8c2d7ce1232a1344c9b58748f1ca; d7b26a3d7b8496a440ae84e242067115700b4e71; b4aa4d018709912222978102336dcc70ec949897; 16d042e210b596a7d44c206bfd12b89763817c20; 813bf8f3be50b6f6ce9a8ef377bd7f121c5b44eb; 2bd021ce52ed0bf98f40107920500fc6fd841a13,,Genetics,199 1,"

dea9fc2c5e16678ad7867bbfb293852bff32d677,"Atrial Fibrillation, Neurocognitive Decline and Gene Expression After Cardiopulmonary Bypass","OBJECTIVE
Atrial fibrillation and neurocognitive decline are common complications after cardiopulmonary bypass. By utilizing genomic microarrays we investigate whether gene expression is associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation and neurocognitive decline.


METHODS
Twenty one cardiac surgery patients were prospectively matched and underwent neurocognitive assessments pre-operatively and four days postoperatively. The whole blood collected in the pre-cardiopulmonary bypass, 6 hours after-cardiopulmonary bypass, and on the 4th postoperative day was hybridized to Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 Plus 2.0 Microarrays. Gene expression in patients who developed postoperative atrial fibrillation and neurocognitive decline (n=6; POAF+NCD) was compared with gene expression in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation and normal cognitive function (n=5; POAF+NORM) and patients with sinus rhythm and normal cognitive function (n=10; SR+NORM). Regulated genes were identified using JMP Genomics 4.0 with a false discovery rate of 0.05 and fold change of >1.5 or <-1.5.


RESULTS
Eleven patients developed postoperative atrial fibrillation. Six of these also developed neurocognitive decline. Of the 12 patients with sinus rhythm, only 2 developed neurocognitive decline. POAF+NCD patients had unique regulation of 17 named genes preoperatively, 60 named genes six hours after cardiopulmonary bypass, and 34 named genes four days postoperatively (P<0.05) compared with normal patients. Pathway analysis demonstrated that these genes are involved in cell death, inflammation, cardiac remodeling and nervous system function.


CONCLUSION
Patients who developed postoperative atrial fibrillation and neurocognitive decline after cardiopulmonary bypass may have differential genomic responses compared to normal patients and patients with only postoperative atrial fibrillation, suggesting common pathophysiology for these conditions.

cb5dcc8308b16aa4559b5b8a34477b363df2e6a3,Abstract 4710: A candidate gene expression signature of early stage lung adenocarcinoma from peripheral whole blood,"Proceedings: AACR 101st Annual Meeting 2010â€â€ Apr 17â€21, 2010; Washington, DC

Background. Early detection in subjects at high risk of lung cancer has great potential to improve survival from this deadly disease. While monitoring the target organ via tissue or imaging is a focus of current screening trials, an accurate blood-based biomarker would be easier and more convenient. No study to date has used blood samples to investigate whole genome expression profiles in lung cancer cases compared to controls. Aims. We identified candidate genetic biomarkers for the detection of early lung adenocarcinoma by contrasting gene expression from peripheral whole blood (PWB) in cases versus controls. Among cases we also explored expression of the identified biomarkers in tumor (T) compared to non involved (NI) lung tissues and their association with survival. Methods. A random sample of 73 stage I adenocarcinoma cases and 80 healthy controls from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) case-control study was studied for genome wide mRNA expression (Affymetrix HG-U133) using PWB collected in PAX tubes (in cases and controls) and from paired snap-frozen T and NI lung tissues (in cases only). A two sample t-test was used to differentiate gene expression in cases compared to controls (overall and stratified by smoking status and by stage), and a linear mixed effects model was used to compare paired T and NI lung tissue samples from cases. Criteria for significance included False Discovery Rate less than or equal to 0.1 and fold changes greater than or equal to 1.5 or less than or equal to 0.66. Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to estimate the effect of gene expression changes on lung cancer survival. Results and Conclusions. We found a gene signature with 20 downregulated and 30 upregulated genes which differentiated stage I cases from controls overall (n=106) and among current smokers (n=39). No significant signature was identified among never (n=30) and former smokers (n=37). Fold changes in stage I cases were consistently stronger than those comparing later stage cases to controls. Downregulation of several T cell receptor and immune related genes in cases compared to controls points to a possibly smoking-related immune impairment at adenocarcinoma initiation. Expression of TGFBR3, RUNX3, TRGC2, TRGV9, TARP, ACP1, VCAN, and TSTA3 genes, all previously implicated in cancer, also differentiated T versus NI lung tissues, suggesting that expression changes of these genes in PWB can be used as markers of related changes in the target organ. In addition, increased ACP1 and TSTA3 expression was associated with adverse survival. Since lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide and current smokers are at very high risk, our smoking-specific findings, if confirmed and translated into screening approaches, have potential public health impact.

These data were combined with data from 1241 additional Ashkenazi controls and tested for association with prostate cancer. Correction for multiple testing was performed using the false discovery rate procedure.Results:Ten of twenty-three SNPs that passed quality control procedures were associated with prostate cancer risk at a false discovery rate of 5%. Of these, nine were originally discovered in studies of individuals of European ancestry. Based on power calculations, the number of significant associations observed is not surprising.Conclusion:We see no convincing evidence that the genetic architecture of prostate cancer in the AJ population is substantively different from that observed in other populations of European ancestry.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joseph Vijai"", ids = ""1765151""); list(name = ""Tomas Kirchhoff"", ids = ""4131042""); list(name = ""Donat Gallagher"", ids = ""31539138""); list(name = ""Nancy Hamel"", ids = ""144339211""); list(name = ""Saurav Guha"", ids = ""4569578""); list(name = ""Ariel Darvasi"", ids = ""6980224""); list(name = ""Todd Lencz"", ids = ""2878517""); list(name = ""William D.

Cold-hardiness related traits.","Adaptation to cold is one of the greatest challenges to forest trees. This process is highly synchronized with environmental cues relating to photoperiod and temperature. Here, we use a candidate gene-based approach to search for genetic associations between 384 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from 117 candidate genes and 21 cold-hardiness related traits. A general linear model approach, including population structure estimates as covariates, was implemented for each marker-trait pair. We discovered 30 highly significant genetic associations [false discovery rate (FDR) Q < 0.10] across 12 candidate genes and 10 of the 21 traits. We also detected a set of 7 markers that had elevated levels of differentiation between sampling sites situated across the Cascade crest in northeastern Washington. Marker effects were small (r(2) < 0.05) and within the range of those published previously for forest trees. The derived SNP allele, as measured by a comparison to a recently diverged sister species, typically affected the phenotype in a way consistent with cold hardiness. The majority of markers were characterized as having largely nonadditive modes of gene action, especially underdominance in the case of cold-tolerance related phenotypes. We place these results in the context of trade-offs between the abilities to grow longer and to avoid fall cold damage, as well as putative epigenetic effects. These associations provide insight into the genetic components of complex traits in coastal Douglas fir, as well as highlight the need for landscape genetic approaches to the detection of adaptive genetic diversity.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Andrew J.

e0ccb32e2188007701a3bcebd5f5f430d402542e,Mp58-15â€ƒhypogonadism Is Associated with Death but Not Cardiovascular Disease,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple studies have assessed the risk between hypogonadism (HG) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insurance claims data capture care across multiple clinical and inpatient settings giving a more complete picture than can be found in single clinic data. Here we utilize a national claims database to examine the association between diagnoses of HG and CVD. METHODS: We analyzed subjects from the IBM MarketScan insurance claims database for 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. Men with HG diagnoses were identified using diagnosis (ICD-9) code, and were matched based on age, year of presentation, and percent with relevant comorbidities, to control men without a diagnosis of HG in a 1:30 ratio. Association between HG, other diseases, and medications was assessed using chi-squared and a Benjamini-Yekutieli adjustment was applied to decrease the false discovery rate. RESULTS: A total of 65,584 men with a diagnosis of HG and 1,967,520 men without a diagnosis of HG were included. The groups were matched by average age (49.7 years); percent hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; and percent with history of heart attack (Table 1A). Overall, an increased risk of death was observed in men with HG (OR: 2.01; CI: 1.95-2.08), but a decreased risk of heart disease, atherosclerosis, cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac conductive disorders, congestive heart failure, or ischemic stroke was observed in men with HG (Table 1B). Diagnoses of erectile dysfunction (OR: 6.15) and testosterone use (OR: 16.7) were included as comparative controls. CONCLUSIONS: Men with HG have an increased mortality risk, but this does not appear to be due to an increased CV risk in these men. In this large population of men with HG and age and co-morbidity matched controls, we find that HG may be associated with lower risk of CVD. Table. No title available. Table. No title available.

db6bbde4a12ff8ce944cbbba706f67dc6716af28,Current Smoking is Associated with Decreased Expression of miR-335-5p in Parenchymal Lung Fibroblasts,"Cigarette smoking causes lung inflammation and tissue damage. Lung fibroblasts play a major role in tissue repair. Previous studies have reported smoking-associated changes in fibroblast responses and methylation patterns. Our aim was to identify the effect of current smoking on miRNA expression in primary lung fibroblasts. Small RNA sequencing was performed on lung fibroblasts from nine current and six ex-smokers with normal lung function. MiR-335-5p and miR-335-3p were significantly downregulated in lung fibroblasts from current compared to ex-smokers (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). Differential miR-335-5p expression was validated with RT-qPCR (p-value = 0.01). The results were validated in lung tissue from current and ex-smokers and in bronchial biopsies from non-diseased smokers and never-smokers (p-value <0.05). The methylation pattern of the miR-335 host gene, determined by methylation-specific qPCR, did not differ between current and ex-smokers. To obtain insights into the genes regulated by miR-335-5p in fibroblasts, we overlapped all proven miR-335-5p targets with our previously published miRNA targetome data in lung fibroblasts. This revealed Rb1, CARF, and SGK3 as likely targets of miR-335-5p in lung fibroblasts. Our study indicates that miR-335-5p downregulation due to current smoking may affect its function in lung fibroblasts by targeting Rb1, CARF and SGK3.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennie Ong"", ids = ""50475978""); list(name = ""Anke van den Berg"", ids = ""47195642""); list(name = ""Alen Faiz"", ids = ""6922979""); list(name = ""Ilse M Boudewijn"", ids = ""9808315""); list(name = ""Wim Timens"", ids = ""5388882""); list(name = ""Cornelis J Vermeulen"", ids = ""35978630""); list(name = ""Brian G G Oliver"", ids = ""144263205""); list(name = ""Klaas Kok"", ids = ""145226692""); list(name = ""Martijn M Terpstra"", ids = ""69562994""); list(name = ""M. van den Berge"", ids = ""145806709""); list(name = ""C.

07b5a17411c571e3045050c7d96cc0f101fd65ae,IDSieve: Protein Identification Using Peptide pI Filtering of MS/MS Data for Improved Confidence in Identifications.,"The main challenge of tandem mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis is to correctly match the tandem mass spectra produced to the correct peptides. However, the large number of protein sequences in a database increases the chances of a false positive identification for any given peptide match. Here we present an automated algorithm called IDSieve that utilizes target-decoy database search strategy in combination with pI filtering to allow greater confidence for peptide identifications. IDSieve considers the SEQUEST parameters Xcorr and aCn to assign statistical confidence (false discovery rates) to the peptide matches. The distribution of predicted pI values for peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) is considered separately for each immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing fraction, and matches with pI values within 1.5 times inter-quartile range (within pI range) are analyzed independently of matches outside the pI ranges. We tested the performance of IDSieve and Peptide/Protein Prophet on the SEQUEST outputs from 60 immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing fractions derived from mouse intestinal epithelial cell protein extracts. Our results demonstrated that IDSieve produced 1355 more peptide spectrum matches (or 330 more peptides) than Peptide Prophet using comparable false positive rate cutoffs. Therefore, combining pI filtering with the appropriate statistical significance measurements allows for a higher number of protein identifications without adversely affecting the false positive rate. We further tested the performance of pI filtering using ID Sieve when samples were prefractionated using either pH range 3.5â€“4.5 or 3â€“10, and either 24cm or 7cm IPG strips.",2011,Chemistry,"list(name = ""K.

607e1921688d44df1f0d9b47cf9faf4acaf5da21,Abstract 288: DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood and the relationship with cancer susceptibility loci at chromosome 8q24,"Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CA

Chromosome 8q24 has emerged as an important region for genetic susceptibility to several cancers, but little is known about the contribution of DNA methylation in this region. To explore the extent of variation in DNA methylation at 8q24 in peripheral blood and its relationship with genetic variation in the region, we conducted a cross-sectional study using blood samples from 80 non-Hispanic Caucasian males in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate between-individual variation in DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites at 8q24 and to investigate the underlying genetic structure in the region by examining correlations for DNA methylation levels with each other and with the established cancer susceptibility SNPs at 8q24. We quantified DNA methylation levels at 145 CpG sites nearby cancer susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 8q24 or the MYC oncogene using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA, which is considered a highly sensitive method to detect differences in DNA methylation levels between individuals. We calculated pairwise Spearman correlations (rho), adjusting for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method. We identified a large number of CpG sites that were reproducible and demonstrated moderate to high between-individual variation in our study population. Among these CpG sites, some sites within or nearby MYC and POU5F1B were strongly correlated with one another (highest rho=0.74), suggesting a coordination of DNA methylation levels in gene regions. Moreover, we observed strong correlations between several CpG sites and some of the known cancer susceptibility SNPs at 8q24. Some of the correlations remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons, including a CpG site and an established prostate cancer SNP in the long non-coding RNA PRNCR1 (Chr8:128167809 and rs1456315, rho=0.52; p-value=1.4x10-6; FDR-adjusted p-value=0.002) and a CpG site (Chr8:128498051) in POU5F1B and the known prostate/colorectal cancer SNP rs6983267 (rho=0.46; p-value=2.0x10-5; FDR-adjusted p-value=0.01). This is the first study to report associations between DNA methylation levels at 8q24 in peripheral blood and 8q24 cancer susceptibility SNPs, suggesting that DNA methylation at this important susceptibility locus may contribute to risk. Additional studies are needed to clarify the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variation at 8q24 and cancer risk.

There are limited data on the mitral valve transcriptome and the aim of this study was to use the microarray technology in conjunction with bioinformatics platforms to analyse transcript changes in MMVD in CKCS compared to normal dogs (non-CKCS). Differentially expressed genes (nâ€‰=â€‰5397) were identified using cut-off settings of fold change, false discovery rate (FDR) and Pâ€‰<0.05. In total, 4002 genes were annotated to a specific transcript in the Affymetrix canine database, and after further filtering, 591 annotated canine genes were identified: 322 (55%) were up-regulated and 269 (45%) were down-regulated. Canine microRNAs (cfa-miR; nâ€‰=â€‰59) were also identified. Gene ontology and network analysis platforms identified between six and 10 significantly different biological function clusters from which the following were selected as relevant to MMVD: inflammation, cell movement, cardiovascular development, extracellular matrix organisation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified three canonical pathways relevant to MMVD: caveolar-mediated endocytosis, remodelling of epithelial adherens junctions, and endothelin-1 signalling. Considering the biological relevance to MMVD, the gene families of importance with significant difference between groups included collagens, ADAMTS peptidases, proteoglycans, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, basement membrane components, cathepsin S, integrins, tight junction cell adhesion proteins, cadherins, other matrix-associated proteins, and members of the serotonin (5-HT)/transforming growth factor -Î² signalling pathway.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""C-C Lu"", ids = ""49676807""); list(name = ""M-M Liu"", ids = ""34659905""); list(name = ""Geoff J.

00c15f28e75c0f68c57ffd8c7f2f8ba976e23fa5,Principal bicorrelation analysis: Unraveling associations between three data sources,"ABSTRACT In this article, we propose a statistical explorative method for data integration. It is developed in the context of early drug development for which it enables the detection of chemical substructures and the identification of genes that mediate their association with the bioactivity (BA). The core of the method is a sparse singular value decomposition for the identification of the gene set and a permutation-based method for the control of the false discovery rate. The method is illustrated using a real dataset, and its properties are empirically evaluated by means of a simulation study. Quantitative Structure Transcriptional Activity Relationship (QSTAR, www.qstar-consortium.org) is a new paradigm in early drug development that extends QSAR by not only considering data on the chemical structure of the compounds and on the compound-induced BA, but by simultaneously using transcriptomics data (gene expression). This approach enables, for example, the detection of chemical substructures that are associated with BA, while at the same time a gene set is correlated with both these substructures and the BA. Although causal associations cannot be formally concluded, these associations may suggest that the compounds act on the BA through a particular genomic pathway.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Federico Mattiello"", ids = ""3425285""); list(name = ""Olivier Thas"", ids = ""1684426""); list(name = ""Bie M.P.

a1476a9f2dd07563f2fc4053ff32a0d42cac5e14,Uniformly consistently estimating the proportion of false null hypotheses via Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral equations,"Abstract The proportion of false null hypotheses is a very important quantity in statistical modelling and inference based on the two-component mixture model and its extensions, and in control and estimation of the false discovery rate and false non-discovery rate. Most existing estimators of this proportion threshold p-values, deconvolve the mixture model under constraints on its components, or depend heavily on the location-shift property of distributions. Hence, they usually are not consistent, applicable to non-location-shift distributions, or applicable to discrete statistics or p-values. To eliminate these shortcomings, we construct uniformly consistent estimators of the proportion as solutions to Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral equations. In particular, we provide such estimators respectively for random variables whose distributions have Riemann-Lebesgue type characteristic functions, whose distributions form discrete natural exponential families with infinite supports, and whose distributions form natural exponential families with separable moment sequences. We provide the speed of convergence and uniform consistency class for each such estimator under independence. In addition, we provide two examples for which a consistent estimator of the proportion cannot be constructed using our techniques.",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiongzhi Chen"", ids = ""40961028"")",ef4fd34d7cd9d5ad065367fd9954967500f5d334; 4c6c2236a2166d19068293dc93946935f7620698; a242ba57781391f9de61b9bb313b2507d98e2e64,,J.

Peptide identifications from tandem mass spectrometry provide prima facie evidence for gene predictions and can discriminate over a set of candidate gene models. Here we apply this to the recently sequenced Aspergillus niger fungal genome from the Joint Genome Institutes (JGI) and another predicted protein set from another A.niger sequence. Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were acquired from 1d gel electrophoresis bands and searched against all available gene models using Average Peptide Scoring (APS) and reverse database searching to produce confident identifications at an acceptable false discovery rate (FDR).Results405 identified peptide sequences were mapped to 214 different A.niger genomic loci to which 4093 predicted gene models clustered, 2872 of which contained the mapped peptides. Interestingly, 13 (6%) of these loci either had no preferred predicted gene model or the genome annotators' chosen ""best"" model for that genomic locus was not found to be the most parsimonious match to the identified peptides. The peptides identified also boosted confidence in predicted gene structures spanning 54 introns from different gene models.ConclusionThis work highlights the potential of integrating experimental proteomics data into genomic annotation pipelines much as expressed sequence tag (EST) data has been. A comparison of the published genome from another strain of A.niger sequenced by DSM showed that a number of the gene models or proteins with proteomics evidence did not occur in both genomes, further highlighting the utility of the method.",2008,Biology; Medicine; Political Science,"list(name = ""James C.

In principle, using side information can allow the statistician to pay attention to variables with a greater potential, which in turn, may lead to more discoveries. We introduce an adaptive knockoff filter, which generalizes the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand\`es, 2015; Cand\`es et al., 2018) in that it uses both the data at hand and side information to adaptively order the variables under study and focus on those that are most promising. Adaptive knockoffs controls the finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) and we demonstrate its power by comparing it with other structured multiple testing methods. We also apply our methodology to real genetic data in order to find associations between genetic variants and various phenotypes such as Crohn's disease and lipid levels. Here, adaptive knockoffs makes more discoveries than reported in previous studies on the same datasets.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhimei Ren"", ids = ""14526183""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

a2e723e9d29ae343ac2765e3055a5fdc6cf32940,Dietary Flavonoid Intake Reduces the Risk of Head and Neck but Not Esophageal or Gastric Cancer in US Men and Women.,"Background: Flavonoids are bioactive polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages of plant origin. Previous studies have shown that flavonoid intake reduces the risk of certain cancers; however, few studies to date have examined associations of flavonoids with upper gastrointestinal cancers or used prospective cohorts.Objective: Our study examined the association between intake of flavonoids (anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones) and risk of head and neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers.Methods: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study is a prospective cohort study that consists of 469,008 participants. Over a mean 12-y follow-up, 2453 head and neck (including 1078 oral cavity, 424 pharyngeal, and 817 laryngeal), 1165 esophageal (890 adenocarcinoma and 275 squamous cell carcinoma), and 1297 gastric (625 cardia and 672 noncardia) cancer cases were identified. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate HRs and CIs for the associations between flavonoid intake assessed at study baseline and cancer outcomes. For 56 hypotheses examined, P-trend values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate control.Results: The highest quintile of total flavonoid intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.86; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02) compared with the lowest quintile. Notably, anthocyanidins were associated with a 28% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.82; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P-trend = 0.0005), and flavanones were associated with a 22% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.89; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.64, 0.94; P-trend: 0.02). No associations between flavonoid intake and risk of esophageal or gastric cancers were found.Conclusions: Our results indicate that flavonoid intake is associated with lower head and neck cancer risk. These associations suggest a protective effect of dietary flavonoids on head and neck cancer risk, and thus potential as a risk reduction strategy.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucy Sun"", ids = ""46732883""); list(name = ""Amy F.

Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 48 women with CS in long-term remission (cases) and 16 controls matched for age, gender and education. The Fatigue impact scale and the comprehensive psychopathological rating scale were used to evaluate fatigue, depression and anxiety. Cases had lower average global DNA methylation than controls (81.2% vs 82.7%; pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). Four hundred and sixty-one differentially methylated regions, containing 3,246 probes mapping to 337 genes were identified. After adjustment for age and smoking, 731 probes in 236 genes were associated with psychopathology (fatigue, depression and/or anxiety). Twenty-four gene ontology terms were associated with psychopathology; terms related to retinoic acid receptor signalling were the most common (adjusted pâ€‰=â€‰0.0007). One gene in particular, COL11A2, was associated with fatigue following a false discovery rate correction.

88c146bd608c153d3ff4b24ad5783b65a48d0cb8,Detection of Differentially Expressed Gene Sets in a Partially Paired Microarray Data Set,"Partially paired data sets often occur in microarray experiments (Kim et al., 2005; Liu, Liang and Jang, 2006). Discussions of testing with partially paired data are found in the literature (Lin and Stivers 1974; Ekbohm, 1976; Bhoj, 1978). Bhoj (1978) initially proposed a test statistic that uses a convex combination of paired and unpaired t statistics. Kim et al. (2005) later proposed the t3 statistic, which is a linear combination of paired and unpaired t statistics, and then used it to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cDNA microarray data. In this paper, we extend Kim et al.â€™s t3 statistic to the Hotellingâ€™s T2 type statistic Tp for detecting DE gene sets of size p. We employ Efronâ€™s empirical null principle to incorporate inter-gene correlation in the estimation of the false discovery rate. Then, the proposed Tp statistic is applied to Kim et alâ€™s CRC data to detect the DE gene sets of sizes p=2 and p=3. Our results show that for small p, particularly for p=2 and marginally for p=3, the proposed Tp statistic compliments the univariate procedure by detecting additional DE genes that were undetected in the univariate test procedure. We also conduct a simulation study to demonstrate that Efronâ€™s empirical null principle is robust to the departure from the normal assumption.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Johan Lim"", ids = ""39605319""); list(name = ""Jayoun Kim"", ids = ""65925123""); list(name = ""Sang-Cheol Kim"", ids = ""49899384""); list(name = ""Donghyeon Yu"", ids = ""1778327""); list(name = ""Kyunga Kim"", ids = ""1843705""); list(name = ""Byung Soo Kim"", ids = ""70906769"")",784a7e9be7ecee92ff6bf0b4353e5bce8ab210ce; 88c146bd608c153d3ff4b24ad5783b65a48d0cb8; 6bcf488765f5b854cffe62f60701153036001aa2,3e21fcfca12cad135252dfaf516a853644e8d15f; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 218d0afe6a17ef42b6cb923d0afa7c453b11b0e2; 008531a1683d189451189b09f6a6a6b4fdd5f24f; a9a3f5e6f6aec6c822963df23b1b40cad30859f7; f899e59a4872bf5b117e6b6c07c6384480a30445; 0d0e87b65e837f3076e264bee9642e0ebeead2e5; ddd3018a0446015d849175748d422d73d67677d8; caa51599a0b1de157f3ff56151889784b2fd051e; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 60fe6fbb3e559ff9c9db540fb8a37a8478f88bf9; 2682fe823c192f441415dbb2d8ca2ea91745e7a0; ad270d59fbcd794338307eadc814e477e8295e4f; 5fa2487db4e2f4ac0e775667f6145cfda058e574; 266510a782dcc6545c4cbcebc55f69ec15534ce6; 894ce13c62241e5a06a1741477dc6f9583146af7; a010c0a76724d9f4123b8e255ee2fb0b07c2c843; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; aa3c789f5b1d48d3782fe3e2ca0572d4e0315645; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; e6529e672b1d87dbd24a69e60bcaf9df6ddba0b3; bb6ef64b9d8738c43198c4da59a030fdf8c1f2c4; c47238d961b310a8418886b6f31c1bf63561e8f5; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 88c146bd608c153d3ff4b24ad5783b65a48d0cb8; 812c7682754726530c475d7046be496c71224de5; 9e26c8be21f341102016fa5a67b06db362bf272a; f8427977b023a51e1a356b2806f4f620004df9dd,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,11,

A less conservative notion, the k-FDR, has been introduced very recently by Sarkar [19], generalizing the false discovery rate of Banjamini and Hochberg [1]. In this article, we bring newer insight to the k-FDR considering a mixture model involving independent p-values before motivating the developments of some new procedures that control it. We prove the k-FDR control of the proposed methods under a slightly weaker condition than in the mixture model. We provide numerical evidence of the proposed methodsâ€™ superior power performance over some kFWER and k-FDR methods.

bd2f1bfc6607300811bb9eccadd835d83234c6bd,Cell type-specific gene expression of midbrain dopaminergic neurons reveals molecules involved in their vulnerability and protection.,"Molecular differences between dopamine (DA) neurons may explain why the mesostriatal DA neurons in the A9 region preferentially degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD) and toxic models, whereas the adjacent A10 region mesolimbic and mesocortical DA neurons are relatively spared. To characterize innate physiological differences between A9 and A10 DA neurons, we determined gene expression profiles in these neurons in the adult mouse by laser capture microdissection, microarray analysis and real-time PCR. We found 42 genes relatively elevated in A9 DA neurons, whereas 61 genes were elevated in A10 DA neurons [> 2-fold; false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%]. Genes of interest for further functional analysis were selected by criteria of (i) fold differences in gene expression, (ii) real-time PCR validation and (iii) potential roles in neurotoxic or protective biochemical pathways. Three A9-elevated molecules [G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K channel 2 (GIRK2), adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT-2) and the growth factor IGF-1] and three A10-elevated peptides (GRP, CGRP and PACAP) were further examined in both alpha-synuclein overexpressing PC12 (PC12-alphaSyn) cells and rat primary ventral mesencephalic (VM) cultures exposed to MPP+ neurotoxicity. GIRK2-positive DA neurons were more vulnerable to MPP+ toxicity and overexpression of GIRK2 increased the vulnerability of PC12-alphaSyn cells to the toxin. Blocking of ANT decreased vulnerability to MPP+ in both cell culture systems. Exposing cells to IGF-1, GRP and PACAP decreased vulnerability of both cell types to MPP+, whereas CGRP protected PC12-alphaSyn cells but not primary VM DA neurons. These results indicate that certain differentially expressed molecules in A9 and A10 DA neurons may play key roles in their relative vulnerability to toxins and PD.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chee Yeun Chung"", ids = ""6604203""); list(name = ""Hyemyung Seo"", ids = ""6132339""); list(name = ""Kai C.

7f53895fc2915491f052d933012acc6b1d765360,Multiple hypothesis testing and RNA-seq differential expression analysis accounting for dependence and relevant covariates,"This dissertation is a collection of four papers on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of high-dimensional data, mostly RNA-seq gene expression data. We introduce in the first two papers two covariate-selection strategies for RNA-seq analysis. As in any experiment or observational study, covariates may hold information about heterogeneity of the experimental or observational units used in the investigation. Either ignoring relevant covariates or accounting for irrelevant covariates may be detrimental to RNA-seq analysis. We show through simulation that our methods outperform methods that do not take covariate selection into account. Next, we develop in the third paper a parametric bootstrap algorithm to analyze RNA-seq datasets from repeated measures designs. In such designs, RNA samples are extracted from each experimental unit at multiple time points. The read counts that result from RNA sequencing of the samples extracted from the same experimental unit tend to be temporally correlated. Simulation studies show the advantages of our method over alternatives that do not account for correlation among observations within experimental units. Finally, we develop a new method to estimate and control false discovery rate (FDR) when identifying simultaneous signals in two independent experiments. Our FDR estimation and control procedure is a generalization of the histogram-based FDR estimation and control procedure for one experiment proposed by Nettleton et al. (2006); Liang and Nettleton (2012). We show that our method performs better than other existing methods both in theory and in simulation.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Yet Nguyen"", ids = ""40449612"")",,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 11a3ac464b7cc5afe48172efe12ce4346dbf452d; 9871c9dce9887bf4798b5cd0a6aab34c3363b898; 701cae7fb41417989c384bcd8268a620c4669ca4; c0b058aca8fa3f7bf3f3286ac8dd9a7113a8c450; 84de2e040bd0536a0e0d0d28c2b4bca0879103bb; 35fa23c9f5577761ff79fd14356736570c43b68a; 217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; 5f7396b134badce1b289b83887cd96e75e1be01f; 3f5e36da07aed0c9028bc8e70b1f686211ad3e4f; 0ae50e4b489a238db047884d58f25b38df9cf15a; 28151f8c40c957c8a89bc08405a0602a6193a56c; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 6a2465793fee97d6840bdfe707d9649386a3f4fa; 357a29d507b392c022dc78c11d7353d75810ac55; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; b5f0e4824fa598942859f64890d2520ff3eb6f30; 1d6cf16816f05b6a80fa466111dea22b680f596c; 5bf77cde348b45a0778b7f637c60ad74466aeef9; 6d86c72535036048445bf287cf5f8b9e540f7600; bd8fd8075999a20633f4d81c69d91ccb30c3e033; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; 9a0f381e166f28851d8613526da0e8a4a3e5e1f0; 7262866140d22894d5f9566fbc162648479971ed; 6c06333850b96721709b3162c6332939a2fdce31; fcbceac118717eb78b2339ce31fb63e05eb52d89; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; df995787d0669643750e62ec012fff4e624bf0ad; eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; b798e74cf8954daae13e4b31c4fed5f4a78035ec; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 2ad0f570dee80d85169c40195db766f3e22f74e7; 84ddf26c9a7a27e34e6d3dbaaad1a74b5890f7a7; fde12e0b207bcd0ee820f4645d63132458bafdbd; 9160789485c02dc413a66d56c3dcd8d9e132c65c; 9bba94f69348234c8e1d1c9ddd898e51f833702e; 6e89cc3a48b6eb9d14e7d1a7b1603cb73ef66537; 59bde7b3624469ed5913f6026b9c1a81985fe81d; 344d7118e0db3173fd934f004584352057120f37; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9f59198430690077f4d3fda7bbbcd90758c8e750; a7b2337beaf9daa25fe4aab80d771f25d9888734; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; 54ed79984192dcacffb6df8685b6028e0489b89e; 293b8c5f33ba68251dbd866c60e7d6a8bd256f5c; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; 41d44a780dba0b8dfbd5f9dca2702f9c8a159cac; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; 73c42031d99e6f2d48d33969b281f84cffce5b47; 30e7e25061b7ccd9a625548dd6836afcff85043b,,,
d0bfc81138899c66d23f723173866df6a68b5ecb,68: Various Relationships between Dna Methylation and Gene Expression in Different Tissues and Ages,"Background Traditionally, DNA methylation is described as a mechanism that represses gene expression by blocking the binding of transcription factors at promoter regions. However, many studies suggest that DNA methylation variation makes a number of diverse contributions to gene expression and its complex underlying mechanisms. Methods To uncover the relationship and mechanism between gene expression and DNA methylation, we tested gene and CpG Pairs (GCPs) for the correlation between gene expression and methylation across different tissues and ages. We collected tissues that have both methylation data and matched expression data from various databases and publications. After filtering samples, we retained 502 adult Prefrontal Cortices (PFC), 43 Lymphoblastoid Cell Llines (LCL), 75 livers, 1201 monocytes, as well as 247 developmental PFCs across the lifespan. To analyze the methylation data, we used the ChAMP package for filtering. For the expression data from different platforms, we used different values as the expression measure. ComBat and SVA were used to control batch effects and other effects for both expression and methylation data. To remove the less variable methylation, we also filtered out 50% methylation probes with small median absolute deviation. For each region, we defined pairs of methylation CpG site and gene expression as CpG sites located within the 10kb flanking region of the corresponding gene or probe. We used Spearman's rank correlations test to assess the correlation of methylation-expression pairs. Results Besides, we performed the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to correct for the multiple hypothesis testing. In the adult PFC region, 230,087 GCPs were analyzed for the Spearman correlation between gene expression and CpG site methylation, and only 8,828 GCPs were significantly correlated after FDR correction. Of these, 5,530 GCPs were negatively correlated and 3,298 GCPs were positively correlated. The developmental PFC and other tissues also exhibited a small proportion of significant GCPs, including 544/174,911 in the LCL, 2,281/210,025 in the liver, 5,134/46,831 in the monocyte and 9,729/134,690 in the developmental PFC. Though thousands of significant GCPs have been identified in different tissues, only 37 of them were consistent in at least three tissues; three of them were shared in all tissues. Additionally, there were 442 negatively and 153 positively correlated GCPs shared between the adult PFC and the developmental PFC. For the CpGs of significant GCPs, we explored the epigenetic state of these CpGs using the Roadmap 15-core state annotation. Negatively correlated CpGs were enriched in active regions containing Active TSS, Flanking Active TSS, and Enhancers, while positive ones were enriched in repressive regions such as Bivalent Enhancer and Repressed PolyComb. Discussion For the genes of significant GCPs, we performed the GO term enrichment analysis using WebGestalt. We found that genes in correlated GCPs in developmental PFC were enriched for neuron projection development (p= 3.96e-12, FDR= 6.11e-09), neuron differentiation (p= 1.08e-11, FDR= 9.25e-09) and synapse part (p= 0e+00, FDR= 0e+00). In the adult PFC data, genes were also enriched for neuron part (p= 2.93e-13, FDR= 3.02e-11), distinct from the GO term referring to genes in the developmental PFC. These results imply that DNA methylation has a special regulated function in cell specification and development.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Kangli Wang"", ids = ""48884748"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,29,
721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef,Improved detection of common variants associated with schizophrenia by leveraging pleiotropy with cardiovascular-disease risk factors.,"Several lines of evidence suggest that genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have the potential to explain more of the ""missing heritability"" of common complex phenotypes. However, reliable methods for identifying a larger proportion of SNPs are currently lacking. Here, we present a genetic-pleiotropy-informed method for improving gene discovery with the use of GWAS summary-statistics data. We applied this methodology to identify additional loci associated with schizophrenia (SCZ), a highly heritable disorder with significant missing heritability. Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest comorbidity between SCZ and cardiovascular-disease (CVD) risk factors, including systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoprotein, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and type 2 diabetes. Using stratified quantile-quantile plots, we show enrichment of SNPs associated with SCZ as a function of the association with several CVD risk factors and a corresponding reduction in false discovery rate (FDR). We validate this ""pleiotropic enrichment"" by demonstrating increased replication rate across independent SCZ substudies. Applying the stratified FDR method, we identified 25 loci associated with SCZ at a conditional FDR level of 0.01. Of these, ten loci are associated with both SCZ and CVD risk factors, mainly triglycerides and low- and high-density lipoproteins but also waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index. Together, these findings suggest the feasibility of using genetic-pleiotropy-informed methods for improving gene discovery in SCZ and identifying potential mechanistic relationships with various CVD risk factors.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ole Andreas Andreassen"", ids = ""1777021""); list(name = ""Srdjan Djurovic"", ids = ""144837550""); list(name = ""Wesley K.

cdd98d5aa38a97429dc94886bb686733258b52c4,Information Content Analysis and Clustering for Signal Anomaly Detection,An information theoretic approach to detecting unusual events in radio signals is presented. Anomalies are detected through a measure of the events' information content. Clustering is utilised to reduce false-positives while allowing a lower discrimination threshold to be used for improved anomaly detection. Experiments with a real wireless local area network test signal shows that it is possible to achieve 100% detection rates while maintaining very low false discovery rate of 1%.,2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mostafa Z.

23fdd046235423d3008115e03f1eeacb54cfe955,Literature aided determination of data quality and statistical significance threshold for gene expression studies,"BackgroundGene expression data are noisy due to technical and biological variability. Consequently, analysis of gene expression data is complex. Different statistical methods produce distinct sets of genes. In addition, selection of expression p-value (EPv) threshold is somewhat arbitrary. In this study, we aimed to develop novel literature based approaches to integrate functional information in analysis of gene expression data.MethodsFunctional relationships between genes were derived by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) of Medline abstracts and used to calculate the function cohesion of gene sets. In this study, literature cohesion was applied in two ways. First, Literature-Based Functional Significance (LBFS) method was developed to calculate a p-value for the cohesion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in order to objectively evaluate the overall biological significance of the gene expression experiments. Second, Literature Aided Statistical Significance Threshold (LASST) was developed to determine the appropriate expression p-value threshold for a given experiment.ResultsWe tested our methods on three different publicly available datasets. LBFS analysis demonstrated that only two experiments were significantly cohesive. For each experiment, we also compared the LBFS values of DEGs generated by four different statistical methods. We found that some statistical tests produced more functionally cohesive gene sets than others. However, no statistical test was consistently better for all experiments. This reemphasizes that a statistical test must be carefully selected for each expression study. Moreover, LASST analysis demonstrated that the expression p-value thresholds for some experiments were considerably lower (p < 0.02 and 0.01), suggesting that the arbitrary p-values and false discovery rate thresholds that are commonly used in expression studies may not be biologically sound.ConclusionsWe have developed robust and objective literature-based methods to evaluate the biological support for gene expression experiments and to determine the appropriate statistical significance threshold. These methods will assist investigators to more efficiently extract biologically meaningful insights from high throughput gene expression experiments.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lijing Xu"", ids = ""1890991""); list(name = ""Cheng Cheng"", ids = ""144341273""); list(name = ""E.

a548f41c6c2d892f31651b68e0758359a2a79819,"Modulation of Gut Microbiota by Glucosamine and Chondroitin in a Randomized, Double-Blind Pilot Trial in Humans","Glucosamine and chondroitin (G&C), typically taken for joint pain, are among the most frequently used specialty supplements by US adults. More recently, G&C have been associated with lower incidence of colorectal cancer in human observational studies and reduced severity of experimentally-induced ulcerative colitis in rodents. However, little is known about their effects on colon-related physiology. G&C are poorly absorbed and therefore metabolized by gut microbiota. G&C have been associated with changes in microbial structure, which may alter host response. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in ten healthy adults to evaluate the effects of a common dose of G&C compared to placebo for 14 days on gut microbial community structure, measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effect of G&C compared to placebo on fecal microbial alpha and beta diversity, seven phyla, and 137 genera. Nine genera were significantly different between interventions (False Discovery Rate < 0.05). Abundances of four Lachnospiraceae genera, two Prevotellaceae genera, and Desulfovibrio were increased after G&C compared to placebo, while Bifidobacterium and a member of the Christensenellaceae family were decreased. Our results suggest that G&C affect the composition of the gut microbiome which may have implications for therapeutic efficacy.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sandi L Navarro"", ids = ""6594087""); list(name = ""Lisa LÃ©vy"", ids = ""40592722""); list(name = ""Keith R.

bbfae94641770c2e87a2a83a06c2dfa70e1333f6,"Identification of Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog downstream target genes with statistical confidence by applying a novel algorithm to time course microarray and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data","BackgroundTarget genes of a transcription factor (TF) Pou5f1 (Oct3/4 or Oct4), which is essential for pluripotency maintenance and self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells, have previously been identified based on their response to Pou5f1 manipulation and occurrence of Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-binding sites in promoters. However, many responding genes with binding sites may not be direct targets because response may be mediated by other genes and ChIP-binding site may not be functional in terms of transcription regulation.ResultsTo reduce the number of false positives, we propose to separate responding genes into groups according to direction, magnitude, and time of response, and to apply the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion to each group individually. Using this novel algorithm with stringent statistical criteria (FDR < 0.2) to a compendium of published and new microarray data (3, 6, 12, and 24 hr after Pou5f1 suppression) and published ChIP data, we identified 420 tentative target genes (TTGs) for Pou5f1. The majority of TTGs (372) were down-regulated after Pou5f1 suppression, indicating that the Pou5f1 functions as an activator of gene expression when it binds to promoters. Interestingly, many activated genes are potent suppressors of transcription, which include polycomb genes, zinc finger TFs, chromatin remodeling factors, and suppressors of signaling. Similar analysis showed that Sox2 and Nanog also function mostly as transcription activators in cooperation with Pou5f1.ConclusionWe have identified the most reliable sets of direct target genes for key pluripotency genes â€“ Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog, and found that they predominantly function as activators of downstream gene expression. Thus, most genes related to cell differentiation are suppressed indirectly.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexei A.

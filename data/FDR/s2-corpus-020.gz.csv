5bfcb4a9ace69f460bd109b8b4098c461c6c5522,Abstract 2792: Polymorphisms in vitamin D-related genes and risk of breast cancer,"Vitamin D is hypothesized to decrease breast cancer risk by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and estrogen synthesis and signalling in breast tissue. Transport of circulating vitamin D to sites of action is facilitated by vitamin D binding protein, encoded by the GC gene, whereupon it binds to the vitamin D receptor, encoded by the VDR gene. Given that polymorphisms in the GC and VDR gene have not been consistently associated with breast cancer risk, our objective was to assess the associations of vitamin D-related genes with breast cancer risk, accounting for ethnicity and menopausal status, and to determine these associations according to tumour receptor status defined by expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). A case-control study of 1,037 breast cancer cases and 1,050 controls age-frequency matched in Vancouver, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario was used. The distribution and associations of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the GC and VDR gene with breast cancer risk and breast tumour subtypes were investigated among premenopausal and postmenopausal European and Asian women in stratified analyses. Following false discovery rate adjustment, no SNP was associated with breast cancer risk among any subgroup. However, among European women, two SNPs in the VDR gene, rs1544410 (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21 - 0.70) and rs7967152 (OR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.62 - 4.85) were associated with risk of ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast tumour subtype, but not with other breast tumour subtypes. Breast tumour subtypes are proposed to be etiologically distinct disease states, with different risk factors and prognostic outcomes. Interactions between variations in vitamin D-related genes and breast tumour subtypes are biologically plausible given our current understanding of anticarcinogenic properties of vitamin D elicited through the regulation of cell growth and reproductive hormone synthesis. These findings provide additional insight into the etiologic differences among breast tumour subtypes.

Fitzpatrick et al. (pp. 246â€“263) use a powerful proprietary program for quantitating the difference between matched pairs of cisplatinresistant and cisplatin-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines. The algorithm does not require tags or labels, just a spike of hen egg-white lysozyme digest. With a false discovery rate of less than 5%, the researchers were able to identify more than 2000 proteins, of which 760 showed significant changes (.1.16-fold). Grouping these changes by function revealed five potential routes of drug resistance, all of which would probably have to be addressed in a multi-drug therapy regimen. The results fit well with other reports on mechanisms for multi-drug resistance in ovarian carcinomas.",2007,Medicine,,,,Proteomics. Clinical applications,1 3,

Transcriptome profiling demonstrated that the single cell-type root hair transcriptome was less complex than the transcriptome of multiple cell-type primary roots without root hairs. In total, 831 genes were exclusively and 5585 genes were preferentially expressed in root hairs [false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤1%]. Among those, the most significantly enriched Gene Ontology (GO) functional terms were related to energy metabolism, highlighting the high energy demand for the development and function of root hairs. Subsequently, the maize homologs for 138 Arabidopsis genes known to be involved in root hair development were identified and their phylogenetic relationship and expression in root hairs were determined. This study indicated that the genetic regulation of root hair development in Arabidopsis and maize is controlled by common genes, but also shows differences which need to be dissected in future genetic experiments. Finally, a maize root view of the eFP browser was implemented including the root hair transcriptome of the present study and several previously published maize root transcriptome data sets. The eFP browser provides color-coded expression levels for these root types and tissues for any gene of interest, thus providing a novel resource to study gene expression and function in maize roots.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefan Hey"", ids = ""47628631""); list(name = ""Jutta A Baldauf"", ids = ""36748332""); list(name = ""Nina Opitz"", ids = ""34686353""); list(name = ""Andrew Lithio"", ids = ""6695533""); list(name = ""Asher Pasha"", ids = ""35160440""); list(name = ""Nicholas Provart"", ids = ""40077990""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""1710786""); list(name = ""Frank Hochholdinger"", ids = ""3196694"")",102e1a2b7e121f0aec629781b79aa89140847d93; 66826d7c3ae05c95f63fe3fae723786633591fe6; fc67ceede0f0d4c127b680ebdccfc29fb6e548f6,f83f76c648359efd9b70171ba1ae69065cc1aaf4; 3d6b3cf7cbf7d6f3f744423f5d3bfad6d7427aa5; 2328a984fc9322927b80925a4c8275d0a4632978; 7efea8abdc31a878adc74ef7fc2bceedba48a5b5; b7f3f9c9115bdd26fb0f80004dd789ea91b02571; a2e8ed435b4aafb6c1fdc324e7397f7d5bd8f408; f1b6c1e47d0463edbcd0929f3ec621c0387f42ae; d046e952eea337b45737981cae8f2a1c84b824f1; b40c93ba0543c111773dc03c93ed70247349f078; c7b25982dea45b8455214cff5d5550e346e95018; 318b9fbfe742c46616e1bcca5ef559af06b71d8f; 4c2b018392eca7e54588ae6ed8505985c878d8ba; 179a74a1ab3b91596471d6e6f2241754fc8b7068; 88a52b0d4d7c3c7f35eb723662e02aa28a25707e; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; 21373b249801529a03b18719a207e15af5490fb2; 8981286326214c365753452805254e3ac66c76b0; af14c0978709e3a1bf340e91f5d2935d78b80159; 18669469b3639277e4e5b7b0b4b93731bb1fc676; 4b4189cfefd9433adcb0bafffcd7e02acad172c8; 0e1d8579f766a5229d0455538b05ccfb161d8c7c; 1570767926bd235430446af79a44eb8e86bc3b64; 05ca7623e6f09738adaf9f4a20b19f02e867da4f; 06e72429b5cd68df279782fcf7b41308666b9625; e84ccd0f1abadf312483382456e3267c7317edb3; 026c8edcfd7c613ee4cf3e5b613269cf6ccc60f0; 5ad3da190696cae4977b771105694dfb4ae31256; b70dee5c365d12f5470de17dd1cb8df19c0a54fd; e9dbd42c6b2a5146901fc5f2871ff388db192507; ac80db7e5599f9fc2e56fbc68230d8b12b1bc3f9; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21786a617e06d12e3d4b1dca8c9ddf8eb349db32; 4787837c5a9a570e2902fbe348f661d3c7bb23b3; 18dbceca0b77a984926206ef77cffab2f6e12f41; 4b6acd715e1728f01f98907215c1a16b303f47c4; cfbee14ddec2b5987b0defedc58982b48bb54d5b; e53d6c0d7c9ad4c0eb0855baceef2306e01a46a2; 50f4bedfb39760b11d786fa7bbab9dd256c34567; cff39deb3c37fe458c2448a58b3b4c415b3cf0c4; 9e3c1bfbf1537b2a73d2a6bff4d1dcf0ee18c272; 6dba4eff67f3c4689d1bc9a3cee9afd99d3a69ea; 465ecac8eddd2c362f0e10de2583a62a1a7c371a; c68c45b7f565314b02973fe177c62a8e5ef7a812; 75b96266257d02a101ca08023d4d0e40211ef4a8; 5a29dc0370752ca2fed81d22f7f08376b3a6f2b3; f256f33b7a0cf35735fba4d5defa2c3da988e490; 2750270b517b97e23acd0ec236f9750edf6bdc2c; 9e5828cbef63f4a35786ae783e064e812db1b711; 3391c0100420ec160ef9f4cfbf3d5ec7bb284aeb; 283e16ab6f2ef32934f87e02d6aefeb07ea2c27a; 9cbc630abf91fb16cfd7651d86a62786254d6217; 8e891b416bfa3edf03e2d528cbcf765956647974; 609cfddb88fe196acd659be2285c3ff94560ca93; 5de8d7ac0c28fdd96de17b17f4b8364fc01bf950; 10addb2702662fced8b48b5083da4e288ac297a0; caa1706bd9471dc2be71d8dab3059dfff3e9c57f; 9cbd5cbca39704b5f46cca2a170654f7e4ebe8a4; fb6c62e8588e9a9b5eb306eda2a3559a9a595557; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 34b83c5ced2b836c74784234dacb063c329d452d; aa4d30b3732fee8b1a5d24ef09026b6e4661f655; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 65bb01b985035307f7b1102e17b8a5c0f2dafff8; c44fcdf847df885bcd4990d64e38a5d76b1d67a3; b180c50ee294d2148e187148c472141d53fbd947; f8531552e2e55395057ab73a24cffe28f6f9ad0c; 3558e7a2d0b5534e0efb50033bfbcaca2a7e900e; cca086598a96a446d34f1312de11a39668d63cda; a33365852cdbfa882aa682ab2adbb261e53ce7fe; bdbb2543529059cae0ea7a0d49d83df0c4fa5b0f,Journal of Experimental Botany,68,2175 - 2185
2185aebf5311b6982c88b6322fb3f04bf8d864c3,"A quantum leap in the reproducibility, precision, and sensitivity of gene expression profile analysis even when sample size is extremely small","Transcript-level quantification is often measured across two groups of patients to aid the discovery of biomarkers and detection of biological mechanisms involving these biomarkers. Statistical tests lack power and false discovery rate is high when sample size is small. Yet, many experiments have very few samples (â‰¤ 5). This creates the impetus for a method to discover biomarkers and mechanisms under very small sample sizes. We present a powerful method, ESSNet, that is able to identify subnetworks consistently across independent datasets of the same disease phenotypes even under very small sample sizes. The key idea of ESSNet is to fragment large pathways into smaller subnetworks and compute a statistic that discriminates the subnetworks in two phenotypes. We do not greedily select genes to be included based on differential expression but rely on gene-expression-level ranking within a phenotype, which is shown to be stable even under extremely small sample sizes. We test our subnetworks on null distributions obtained by array rotation; this preserves the gene-gene correlation structure and is suitable for datasets with small sample size allowing us to consistently predict relevant subnetworks even when sample size is small. For most other methods, this consistency drops to less than 10% when we test them on datasets with only two samples from each phenotype, whereas ESSNet is able to achieve an average consistency of 58% (72% when we consider genes within the subnetworks) and continues to be superior when sample size is large. We further show that the subnetworks identified by ESSNet are highly correlated to many references in the biological literature.

fa499a7cb25be1ee090f00a7adc920da2f2e28ab,Graph Estimation for Matrix-variate Gaussian Data,"Matrix-variate Gaussian graphical models (GGM) have been widely used for modeling matrix-variate data. Since the support of sparse precision matrix represents the conditional independence graph among matrix entries, conducting support recovery yields valuable information. A commonly used approach is the penalized log-likelihood method. However, due to the complicated structure of precision matrices in the form of Kronecker product, the log-likelihood is non-convex, which presents challenges for both computation and theoretical analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach by formulating the support recovery problem into a multiple testing problem. A new test statistic is developed and based on that, we use the popular Benjamini and Hochberg's procedure to control false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically. Our method involves only convex optimization, making it computationally attractive. Theoretically, our method allows very weak conditions, i.e., even when the sample size is finite and the dimensions go to infinity, the asymptotic normality of the test statistics and FDR control can still be guaranteed. We further provide the power analysis result.

The approach uses the false discovery rate concept and is concerned with testing group differences on a set of variables. The method can be used for ascertaining violations of MCAR and disproving this mechanism in empirical behavioral and social research. The procedure can also be employed when locating violations of MCAR in observed measures is of interest.

The cecal microbiota assessment displayed a shift in the beta diversity in chickens fed TM-based diets. The TM10 and TM15 birds showed a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Firmicutes phylum and lower Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratios (False Discovery Rate [FDR] < 0.05), respectively, than the TM5 group. The relative abundance of Clostridium, Alistipes and Sutterella genera significantly increased in TM chickens (FDR < 0.05), while birds fed TM-based diets displayed a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Ruminococcus genus in comparison with the C group (FDR < 0.05). Gut mucin composition evaluation revealed higher mucin staining intensity in the intestinal villi of TM5 birds than the other TM groups, as well as mucin reduction in the intestinal villi of TM10 birds when compared to the C group (p < 0.05).

f8f64893612393d26a00507c2723456ff2a55921,Discovery and Longitudinal Evaluation of Candidate Biomarkers for Ischaemic Stroke by Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics,Application of acute therapies such as thrombolysis for ischaemic stroke (IS) is constrained because of diagnostic uncertainty and the dynamic nature of stroke biology. To investigate changes in blood proteins after stroke and as a result of thrombolysis treatment we performed label-free quantitative proteomics on serum samples using high-resolution mass spectrometry and long high-performance liquid chromatography gradient (5 hours) combined with a 50-cm column to optimise the peptide separation. We identified (false discovery rate [FDR]: 1%) and quantified a total of 574 protein groups from a total of 92 samples from 30 patients. Ten patients were treated by thrombolysis as part of a randomised placebo-controlled trial and up to 5 samples were collected from each individual at different time points after stroke. We identified 26 proteins differently expressed by treatment group (FDR: 5%) and significant changes of expression over time for 23 proteins (FDR: 10%). Molecules such as fibrinogen and C-reactive protein showed expression profiles with a high-potential clinical utility in the acute stroke setting. Protein expression profiles vary acutely in the blood after stroke and have the potential to allow the construction of a stroke clock and to have an impact on IS treatment decision making.,2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marie Dagonnier"", ids = ""8334917""); list(name = ""Ira R Cooke"", ids = ""39937386""); list(name = ""Pierre Faou"", ids = ""3250963""); list(name = ""Tara Kate Sidon"", ids = ""8282467""); list(name = ""Helen M.

Mendelian randomization is a method for exploring observational associations to find evidence of causality.


OBJECTIVE
To apply Mendelian randomization between risk factors/phenotypic traits (exposures) and PD in a large, unbiased manner, and to create a public resource for research.


METHODS
We used two-sample Mendelian randomization in which the summary statistics relating to single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 5,839 genome-wide association studies of exposures were used to assess causal relationships with PD. We selected the highest-quality exposure genome-wide association studies for this report (n = 401). For the disease outcome, summary statistics from the largest published PD genome-wide association studies were used. For each exposure, the causal effect on PD was assessed using the inverse variance weighted method, followed by a range of sensitivity analyses. We used a false discovery rate of 5% from the inverse variance weighted analysis to prioritize exposures of interest.


RESULTS
We observed evidence for causal associations between 12 exposures and risk of PD. Of these, nine were effects related to increasing adiposity and decreasing risk of PD. The remaining top three exposures that affected PD risk were tea drinking, time spent watching television, and forced vital capacity, but these may have been biased and were less convincing. Other exposures at nominal statistical significance included inverse effects of smoking and alcohol.


CONCLUSIONS
We present a new platform which offers Mendelian randomization analyses for a total of 5,839 genome-wide association studies versus the largest PD genome-wide association studies available (https://pdgenetics.shinyapps.io/MRportal/). Alongside, we report further evidence to support a causal role for adiposity on lowering the risk of PD. Â© 2019 The Authors.

05e6ec432b2ef96701d78d10b5dfbd5abd357099,Genome-Wide Association Analysis Identifi es Candidate Genes Associated with Iron Defi ciency Chlorosis in Soybean,"Iron defi ciency chlorosis (IDC) is a signifi cant yield-limiting problem in several major soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production regions in the United States. Soybean plants display a variety of symptoms that range from a slight yellowing of the leaf to interveinal chlorosis, to stunted growth that reduces yield. The objective of this analysis was to employ single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association mapping to uncover genomic regions associated with IDC tolerance. Two populations [2005 (n = 143) and 2006 (n = 141)] were evaluated in replicated, multilocation IDC trials. After controlling for population structure and individual relatedness, and selecting statistical models that minimized false positives, 42 and 88 loci, with minor allele frequency >10%, were signifi cant in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The loci accounted for 74.5% of the phenotypic variation in IDC in2005 and 93.8% of the variation in 2006. Nine loci from seven genomic locations were signifi cant in both years. These loci accounted for 43.7% of the variation in 2005 and 47.6% in 2006. A number of the loci discovered here mapped at or near previously discovered IDC quantitative trait loci (QTL). A total of 15 genes known to be involved in iron metabolism mapped in the vicinity (<500 kb) of signifi cant markers in one or both populations. THE DEMAND FOR SOYBEAN [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] has grown consistently in the United States over the last decades. Th is has resulted in the expansion of the growing regions north and west of the traditional region. Th is expansion has been into soils that diff er from those on which the crop was historically bred. Th e characteristics of the soil have led to the appearance of iron defi ciency chlorosis (IDC), an important yield-limiting factor for soybeans grown on calcareous soil. Calcareous soil, with a relatively high percentage of calcium carbonate and soluble salts, is commonly present in the north-central regions of the United States and extends from eastern North Dakota and South Dakota and into central Minnesota, central Iowa, and central Nebraska and Kansas (Franzen and Richardson, 2000). For many producers in these regions, IDC is considered a major yield limiting factor. In Iowa and Minnesota alone, IDC can render losses exceeding US$10 million due to decreased soybean production (Hansen et al., 2004). Iron defi ciency chlorosis results from the inability of some genotypes to effi ciently mobilize iron into the plant when it is growing in high pH calcareous soils. In these soils, ferrous iron is not readily oxidized to ferric Published in The Plant Genome 4:154â€“164.

c672ea943ad4a7438ee71bb985060514213a3926,Association of Oral Microbiome With Risk for Incident Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer,"Importance Case-control studies show a possible relationship between oral bacteria and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Prospective studies are needed to examine the temporal relationship between oral microbiome and subsequent risk of HNSCC. Objective To prospectively examine associations between the oral microbiome and incident HNSCC. Design, Setting, and Participants This nested case-control study was carried out in 2 prospective cohort studies: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Among 122 004 participants, 129 incident patient cases of HNSCC were identified during an average 3.9 years of follow-up. Two controls per patient case (nâ€‰=â€‰254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. All participants provided mouthwash samples and were cancer-free at baseline. Exposures Oral microbiome composition and specific bacterial abundances were determined through bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall oral microbiome composition and specific taxa abundances were compared for the case group and the control group, using PERMANOVA and negative binomial generalized linear models, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, cohort, smoking, alcohol, and oral human papillomavirus-16 status. Taxa with a 2-sided false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-value (q-value) <.10 were considered significant. Main Outcomes and Measures Incident HNSCC. Results The study included 58 patient cases from CPS-II (mean [SD] age, 71.0 [6.4] years; 16 [27.6%] women) and 71 patient cases from PLCO (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [4.8] years; 13 [18.3%] women). Two controls per patient case (nâ€‰=â€‰254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. Head and neck squamous cell cancer cases and controls were similar with respect to age, sex, and race. Patients in the case group were more often current tobacco smokers, tended to have greater alcohol consumption (among drinkers), and to be positive for oral carriage of papillomavirus-16. Overall microbiome composition was not associated with risk of HNSCC. Greater abundance of genera Corynebacterium (fold change [FC], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.80; qâ€‰=â€‰.06) and Kingella (FC, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86; qâ€‰=â€‰.08) were associated with decreased risk of HNSCC, potentially owing to carcinogen metabolism capacity. These findings were consistent for both cohorts and by cohort follow-up time. The observed relationships tended to be stronger for larynx cancer and for individuals with a history of tobacco use. Conclusions and Relevance This study demonstrates that greater oral abundance of commensal Corynebacterium and Kingella is associated with decreased risk of HNSCC, with potential implications for cancer prevention.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Richard B Hayes"", ids = ""3607948""); list(name = ""Jiyoung Ahn"", ids = ""8527795""); list(name = ""Xiaozhou Fan"", ids = ""49537555""); list(name = ""Brandilyn A Peters"", ids = ""37518503""); list(name = ""Yingfei Ma"", ids = ""3762426""); list(name = ""Liying Yang"", ids = ""46554668""); list(name = ""Ilir Agalliu"", ids = ""6010360""); list(name = ""Robert D Burk"", ids = ""3192123""); list(name = ""Ian Ganly"", ids = ""4194732""); list(name = ""Mark P.

91c01c585d3f8b4aeb33a3bed0256fbe5fb15d25,Buparlisib/BKM120 PI3 Kinase Therapy in B Cell and T Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL): Identification of Resistance Pathways and Biomarker Discovery,"Background: The PI3K pathway plays a significant role in cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair and it is commonly dysregulated in cancers making it an attractive therapeutic target. BKM120 (buparlisib) is a novel oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor with antitumor activity and efficacy reported in solid tumors. It is in phase I/II clinical trials for treatment of relapsed-refractory NHL. There is a paucity of data, however, on molecular mechanisms of action and biological pathways of resistance for BKM120-treated lymphoma. Through a systems biology approach, we determined key molecular pathways and mechanisms associated with BKM120 treatment in a multitude of lymphoma cell lines.

Methods: T cell lymphoma (Jurkat, Hut78, HH), HL (L428, L540), Burkitt lymphoma (Raji), and DLBCL (SUDHL4, SUDHL10, OCILY19) cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of BKM120 (0.16-10uM) in 96 well plate and cell viability assessed by MTT assay. Global transcriptome analysis was done on SUDHL4, Raji, Jurkat, Hut78 and L540 cells treated with BKM120 at IC50 and compared to untreated control cells. Significant genes were determined by applying a one-way ANOVA with an adjusted Bonferroni correction for a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 with further analysis using a fold change greater than Â±1.2. Pathway and functional relationships were observed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Established systems biology analysis technique was used to determine key genes involved with BKM120 treatment. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V and propidium iodine (AV/PI) analysis. For cell cycle analysis, cells were exposed to BrdU and stained with anti-BrdU FITC and 7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Results: Cell viability showed dose-dependent growth inhibition in all lines with IC50 between 0.316Î¼M-3.72Î¼M at 72 hours. Global transcriptome analysis revealed BKM120 treated lymphoma cells had a conserved inhibitory impact on cell cycle, DNA replication and metabolic process across all cell lines. Systems biology analysis revealed 32 key driving genes responsible for BKM120 predicted inhibition of tumors for all lymphoma cells with exception of Jurkat (see figure below). GADD45A, a known tumor suppressor involved with DNA damage response, was found as a key upregulated gene involved in BKM120-treated cells. Although a predicted inhibition for tumor growth was also predicted for Jurkat, a different profile of key genes was seen. AV/PI-staining and flow cytometry revealed dose-dependent increase of apoptotic cells in all lymphoma cell lines. BrdU incorporation revealed induction of G2/M arrest in Jurkat and Hut78. GADD45 siRNA knock out in Hut78 cells treated with BKM120 abrogated G2/M arrest. Western blots showed decreased phosphorylation of PI3K and mTOR substrates including 4-EBP and phospho-p70S6K with BKM120 treatment. Phosphorylation of MEK/ERK was down regulated at lower doses of BKM120, while increased phosphorylation was noted at higher doses. Finally, analysis of cell cycle regulatory proteins Cyclin, CDK and phospho-histone H3 with BKM120 treatment resulted in expression changes consistent with G2/M arrest and led to increased PARP cleavage in all lymphoma cell lines.

Conclusions: Through systems biology analyses, we identified that BKM120 treatment of lymphoma produced prominent impairment of cell cycle, DNA replication and metabolic function as core responses to PI3K inhibition, which contributed to tumor inhibition predictions. Possible mechanisms of resistance to BKM120 were predicted through cell cycle (G2/M) arrest and MAPK activation. Furthermore, GADD45A was discovered as a key driver with BKM120 treatment across multiple lymphoma cell lines. Collectively, these data provide strong pre-clinical evidence towards identification of key drivers responsible for resistance with PI3 kinase inhibitor therapy, which may inform biomarker discovery as well as rational therapeutic combinations.

Common key genes for BKM120 treated. Top panels are networks of the key genes interacting. Bottom panels are the prediction for cancer risk with BKM120 treatment versus controls. Based on literature the fold-change values of genes are classified as tumor promoters or tumor suppressors. Carcinogenic Risk Score (CRS) is calculated based on these values to determine if there is a promoted risk (positive value) or inhibitory risk for cancer (negative value).

Milk protein expression in healthy cows and cows with mastitis will provide information important for the dairy food industry and immune function in the mammary gland. To facilitate protein discovery, milk was fractioned into whey, milk fat globule membranes (MFGM) and exosomes from healthy and Staphylococcus aureus infected cows. Amine-reactive isobaric tags (iTRAQ) were used to quantify protein changes between milk fractions isolated from healthy and S. aureus infected cows. 2971 milk proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of 0.1%. Greater than 300 milk proteins associated with host defense were identified and 94 were significantly differentially regulated in S. aureus infected milk compared to their uninfected controls. These differentially regulated host defense proteins were selectively segregated in the 3 milk compartments examined. An example of this segregation of host defense proteins was the partitioning and high concentration of proteins indicative of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in the MFGM preparations from S. aureus infected milk as compared to exosomes or whey. Protein composition changes found in milk exosomes, MFGM and whey during an infection provides new and comprehensive information on milk protein composition in general as well as changes occurring during an infection.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
The significance of this study is the identification and quantification of the individual components of the neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) functional proteome in an apparent stable complex with MFGM and/or milk fat globules during an intra-mammary infection. NETs could be functionally relevant in intra-mammary infection, as it is known that during an infection neutrophils ingest large amounts of milk fat that down regulates many of their traditional immune functions. Thus the presence of NETs in milk fat provides new insights to mammary immune function and suggests a role for NETs in clinical mastitis. These in vivo NETs can now be tested to determine if they retain functional antimicrobial activity when primarily associated with milk fat. Then we can estimate their real world functional relevance during an intra-mammary infection, which is one key to understanding clinical mastitis in dairy cows.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy A Reinhardt"", ids = ""6338946""); list(name = ""Randy E Sacco"", ids = ""36670646""); list(name = ""Brian J.

4b425175c6e5383c7361b2edd63a30b4b1869344,Genome-Wide Association Study in an Amerindian Ancestry Population Reveals Novel Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Risk Loci and the Role of European Admixture.,"OBJECTIVE
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component. We undertook the present work to perform the first genome-wide association study on individuals from the Americas who are enriched for Native American heritage.


METHODS
We analyzed 3,710 individuals from the US and 4 countries of Latin America who were diagnosed as having SLE, and healthy controls. Samples were genotyped with HumanOmni1 BeadChip. Data on out-of-study controls genotyped with HumanOmni2.5 were also included. Statistical analyses were performed using SNPtest and SNPGWA. Data were adjusted for genomic control and false discovery rate. Imputation was performed using Impute2 and, for classic HLA alleles, HiBag. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.


RESULTS
The IRF5-TNPO3 region showed the strongest association and largest OR for SLE (rs10488631: genomic control-adjusted P [Pgcadj ] = 2.61 Ã— 10(-29), OR 2.12 [95% CI 1.88-2.39]), followed by HLA class II on the DQA2-DQB1 loci (rs9275572: Pgcadj â€‰=â€‰1.11 Ã— 10(-16), OR 1.62 [95% CI 1.46-1.80] and rs9271366: Pgcadj â€‰=â€‰6.46 Ã— 10(-12), OR 2.06 [95% CI 1.71-2.50]). Other known SLE loci found to be associated in this population were ITGAM, STAT4, TNIP1, NCF2, and IRAK1. We identified a novel locus on 10q24.33 (rs4917385: Pgcadj â€‰=â€‰1.39 Ã— 10(-8)) with an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effect (Peqtl â€‰=â€‰8.0 Ã— 10(-37) at USMG5/miR1307), and several new suggestive loci. SLE risk loci previously identified in Europeans and Asians were corroborated. Local ancestry estimation showed that the HLA allele risk contribution is of European ancestral origin. Imputation of HLA alleles suggested that autochthonous Native American haplotypes provide protection against development of SLE.

1cb03d81ccce3359a00480558218551c2bfa8360,Altered Functional Connectivity of Hypothalamus in Lifelong Premature Ejaculation Patients.,"BACKGROUND
As one of the most prevalent sexual dysfunctions in men, lifelong premature ejaculation (PE) often leads to patient distress. The hypothalamus is implicated in the ejaculatory control of healthy males. However, we do not know whether the hypothalamus-related intrinsic connectivity is altered in lifelong PE patients.


PURPOSE
To investigate abnormal intrinsic connectivity of the hypothalamus in lifelong PE patients compared with healthy controls (HCs).


STUDY TYPE
Prospective pilot study using cross-sectional data of patients and HCs.


SUBJECTS
Forty-seven lifelong PE patients and 30 HCs were included in this study.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
3.0T MRI scanner for T1 -weighted imaging using spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence and functional imaging using a single-shot gradient recalled echo sequence.


ASSESSMENT
Preprocessing of MRI data and hypothalamus-seeded functional connectivity (FC) computation were performed using DPABI4.1.


STATISTICAL TESTS
The two-sample t-test within SPM12 was adopted to examine possible alterations of intrinsic connectivity of hypothalamus in lifelong PE patients compared with HCs including anxiety and depression scores as covariates (false discovery rate-corrected, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The correlation analysis was then used to assess possible associations between the imaging findings and clinical features in the patient group (Bonferroni-corrected, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).


RESULTS
Compared with HCs, lifelong PE patients had decreased hypothalamus-seeded FC in the left orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral insula, superior temporal cortex, superior temporal pole, middle temporal cortex, left fusiform, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right cerebellum. The intravaginal ejaculatory latency time positively correlated with the mean z-score from the hypothalamus-insula (r = 0.45) and hypothalamus-cerebellum (r = 0.48) intrinsic connectivity, separately.


DATA CONCLUSION
We have shown that hypothalamus-seeded FC alterations and the correlations between the aforementioned abnormal FC alterations and intravaginal ejaculatory latency time. The current findings may promote the understanding of the hypothalamus-related neural mechanisms involved in the abnormal ejaculatory information processing in lifelong PE patients.

f0c3736c483b2e750616bcdb360939c71883a00b,Lifetime major depression and grey-matter volume,"Background
There is evidence of structural brain alterations in major depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about how these alterations might be affected by age at onset or genetic vulnerability. This study examines whether lifetime episodes of MDD are associated with specific alterations in grey-matter volume, and whether those alterations vary according to sex or serotonin transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) genotype (LL, SL or SS).


Methods
We used structural MRI to acquire anatomic scans from 610 community-dwelling participants. We derived quantitative regional estimates of grey-matter volume in 16 subregions using FreeSurfer software. We diagnosed MDD according to DSM-IV criteria. We adjusted analyses for age, sex, total brain volume, education level, head injury and comorbidities.


Results
Lifetime MDD was associated with a smaller insula, thalamus, ventral diencephalon, pallidum and nucleus accumbens and with a larger pericalcarine region in both men and women. These associations remained after adjustment for false discovery rate. Lifetime MDD was also associated with a smaller caudate nucleus and amygdala in men and with a larger rostral anterior cingulate cortex in women. Late-onset first episodes of MDD (after age 50 years) were associated with a larger rostral anterior cingulate cortex and lingual and pericalcarine regions; early-onset MDD was associated with a smaller ventral diencephalon and nucleus accumbens.

c62923437d4404d3bb5054389c47b07493fba45c,The Transcriptional Signature of a Runnerâ€™s High,"Introduction Endorphins, endocannabinoids, monoamines, and neurotrophins have all been implicated in the euphoric response to endurance running, known as a runnerâ€™s high (RH). The epitranscriptional mechanisms regulating this effect have not been defined. Here, we investigate peripheral microâ€“ribonucleic acid (miRNA) changes unique to athletes experiencing postrun euphoria, yielding insights into gene networks that control an RH. Methods A cohort study involving 25 collegiate runners (48% females, age = 20 Â± 1 yr) examined salivary RNA levels before and after a long-distance run. Participants were divided into RH and nonrunnerâ€™s high (NRH) groups based on surveys of four criteria (mood, lost sense of time, run quality, and euphoria). Physiological measures were also recorded (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, and salivary serotonin). Levels of miRNAs and their messenger RNA targets were compared across pre- and postrun samples from RH and NRH groups with two-way ANOVA. Representation of opioid, gamma-aminobutyic acid (GABA), endocannabinoid, neurotrophin, serotonergic, and dopaminergic pathways was assessed in DIANA miRPath. Pearsonâ€™s correlation analyses examined relationships between miRNAs and RH indices. Results RH participants (n = 13) demonstrated postrun mydriasis (P = 0.046) and hypothermia (P = 0.043) relative to NRH participants (n = 12) but had no difference in serotonin dynamics (P = 0.88). Six miRNAs (miR-194-5p, miR-4676-3p, miR-4254, miR-4425, miR-1273-3p, miR-6743-5p) exhibited significant effects (false discovery rate P value < 0.05) across pre- or postrun and RH/NRH groups. These miRNAs displayed target enrichment for opioid (P = 2.74Eâˆ’06) and GABA (P = 0.00016) pathways. miR-1237-3p levels were related with lost sense of time (R = 0.40). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK11), an endocannabinoid target of miR-1273-3p, was nominally elevated in RH participants (false discovery rate P value = 0.11). Conclusions Unique dynamics in miRNA concentration occur in athletes with subjective/objective evidence of RH, targeting genes implicated endorphin, endocannabinoid, and GABAergic signaling.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Steven D Hicks"", ids = ""48248516""); list(name = ""P.

Recently, changes in the circulating levels of placental extracellular vesicles (EVs) during pregnancy have been associated with various pregnancy complications. However, progress in the field is hindered by the inability to isolate placental EVs from the maternal circulation. A longitudinal study design was used to determine the protein cargo present in circulating placental EVs in maternal plasma of term and preterm birth across gestation (i.e. first, second and third trimester). Placental derived EVs were enriched from the total EVs population based on their expression of membrane bound placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). A quantitative, information-independent acquisition (Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All Theoretical Mass Spectra [SWATH]) approach identified and quantified the placental EV protein contents. PLAP+ EVs do not change in characteristics (size shape and markers) but did differ in numbers across gestation with low levels in PTB. A comparison analysis between the PLAP+ EV proteome from term and PTB revealed 96 proteins differing significantly (P<0.05, False Discovery Rate 1%) across gestation. Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed consistent upregulation of inflammatory pathways in both, upregulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition pathways at term and down regulation of coagulation/complement activation in preterm. Characterization of the proteomic profile in PLAP+ EVs across gestation demonstrates dramatic changes, which might be used to understand the biological process associated with early parturition and develop biomarkers for predicting high risk status for PTB.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramkumar Menon"", ids = ""144434226""); list(name = ""Chirantan Debnath"", ids = ""30981388""); list(name = ""Andrew Lai"", ids = ""50731419""); list(name = ""Dominic Guanzon"", ids = ""9760995""); list(name = ""Shinjini Bhatnagar"", ids = ""144264341""); list(name = ""Pallavi K Kshetrapal"", ids = ""35307819""); list(name = ""Samantha Sheller-Miller"", ids = ""1399723618""); list(name = ""Carlos Salomon"", ids = ""145848422"")",,,Endocrinology,161,
723e929d351000b219eb6663ed8f82684795c9a2,Gene expression effects of lithium and valproic acid in a serotonergic cell line.,"Valproic acid (VPA) and lithium are widely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. However, the underlying mechanism of action of these drugs is not clearly understood. We used RNA-Seq analysis to examine the global profile of gene expression in a rat serotonergic cell line (RN46A) after exposure to these two mood stabilizer drugs. Numerous genes were differentially regulated in response to VPA (log2 fold change â‰¥ 1.0; i.e., odds ratio of â‰¥2, at false discovery rate <5%), but only two genes ( Dynlrb2 and Cdyl2) showed significant differential regulation after exposure of the cells to lithium, with the same analysis criteria. Both of these genes were also regulated by VPA. Many of the differentially expressed genes had functions of potential relevance to mood disorders or their treatment, such as several serpin family genes (including neuroserpin), Nts (neurotensin), Maob (monoamine oxidase B), and Ap2b1, which is important for synaptic vesicle function. Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of Gene Ontology terms such as extracellular matrix remodeling, cell adhesion, and chemotaxis. This study in a cell line derived from the raphe nucleus has identified a range of genes and pathways that provide novel insights into potential therapeutic actions of the commonly used mood stabilizer drugs.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Diana Balasubramanian"", ids = ""7357014""); list(name = ""John F.

Quantitation of four independently purified membrane fractions from HeLa cells gave high accuracy (<8% error) and precision (<12% relative S.D.), demonstrating a high degree of consistency and reproducibility of this quantitation platform. Under stringent identification criteria (false discovery rate = 0%), the strategy efficiently quantified membrane proteins; as many as 520 proteins (91%) were membrane proteins, each quantified based on an average of 14.1 peptides per integral membrane protein. In addition to significant improvements in signal intensity for most quantified proteins, most remarkably, topological analysis revealed that the biggest improvement was achieved in detection of transmembrane peptides from integral membrane proteins with up to 19 transmembrane helices. To the best of our knowledge, this level of coverage exceeds that achieved previously using MS and provides superior quantitation accuracy compared with other methods. We applied this approach to the first proteomics delineation of phenotypic expression in a mouse model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). By characterizing kidney cell plasma membrane from wild-type versus PKD1 knock-out mice, 791 proteins were quantified, and 67 and 37 proteins showed > or =2-fold up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively. Some of these differentially expressed membrane proteins are involved in the mechanisms underlying major abnormalities in ADPKD, including epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, ion and fluid secretion, and membrane protein polarity. Among these proteins, targeting therapeutics to certain transporters/receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, has proven effective in preclinical studies of ADPKD; others are known drug targets in various diseases. Our method demonstrates how comparative membrane proteomics can provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying ADPKD and the identification of potential drug targets, which may lead to new therapeutic opportunities to prevent or retard the disease.",2008,Medicine;

8c06afb11024a7fbe8fb0193726eb75bff9de533,SPatial REgression Analysis of Diffusion tensor imaging ( SPREAD ) for longitudinal comparison of neurodegenerative disease progression in individual subjects,"Introduction: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique [1] has been applied to achieve more robust early detections of neurodegenerative diseases and more effective monitoring the progression of disease-related abnormalities in white matter (WM) longitudinally. For diseases that usually affect common WM structures among the diseased population, advanced group-based statistical comparisons, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM) [2] and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) [3], can be used to achieve adequate statistical power. However, two major limitations exist in these analyses. For several neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), the brain abnormality has strong subject-dependent or time-dependent heterogeneous patterns. Moreover, most existing analyses for DTI do not take into consideration of the intrinsic spatial/intensity correlation of neighboring voxels. In this study, we propose a novel statistical analysis approach for DTI based on a nonparametric spatial regression fitting of DTI data among neighboring voxels. Using nonparametric resampling methods, statistical inference can be made for both group comparison among individuals and longitudinal comparison within the same individual. Effectiveness of this approach on group comparison was compared with the VBM approach through numerical simulations. The longitudinal analysis of a single MS patient with progressive MS lesions was conducted for the purpose of concept proof. Methods: (I). Theory: Neighboring voxels naturally belong to the same anatomical structure and are potentially affected by the common pathophysiological changes. This abundant information of spatial correlation in DTI can be used for a) detecting longitudinal abnormalities of a single subject from just one pre and one post brain scan; b) boosting statistical power for traditional group comparisons. The proposed method includes three parts. (1) A nonparametric spatial regression to fit the fractional anisotropy (FA) values as a spatial function. In this study the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with Gaussian kernel was used. (2) A non-parametric group comparison. The difference (or mean difference in group comparison) between pre and post FA maps is used to quantify FA changes. To simulate the distribution of FA values under the null hypothesis (no longitudinal change is present in the FA maps), we randomly permuted the time label of FA value at each voxel for 1000 times and re-run kernel regression for each permutation. A resampling based p-value was obtained for each voxel. (3) A multiple testing procedure to control a suitable type I error rate such as familywise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR). We applied a tailored Westfall-Young procedure to control FWER at 0.05 level in this study. (II). Simulations for Group Comparison. A DTI dataset (isotropic 2x2x2 mm voxel, 60 diffusion gradient directions with b=700 s/mm) of a healthy subject was selected. Gaussian noise determined by the SNR level of the original DTI was added to generate two groups of DTI data, simulating two serial data of the same subject. For each time point, the numbers of repeat measurements of DTI (r) investigated were 3,4,5,6. For simulated data of the 2 time point, we added different effect sizes (es) to the largest eigenvalue (Î»1) of each voxel within a cubic region (5x5x3 voxels) at the center of splenium corpus callosum, where es took values of {0%,10%,20%,30%,40%} of the mean Î»1 value over all voxels within the selected region from the original DTI map. This 5x5x3 region simulated a diseased area (Fig.1A). For each combination of r and es, 100 simulated datasets were generated. Two-sample t-tests were conducted using the VBM analysis in the SPM package and the proposed approach. Performance of two approaches was compared through the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) analysis among 100 simulated datasets. (III). Longitudinal Analysis of the Progression of a MS Patient. Four datasets of a MS patient acquired within a year (average time interval between scans: 3 months) were analyzed. Each dataset included a DTI scan (2x2x3mm voxel, 24 diffusion directions with b=1000 s/mm), a FLAIR scan and a T1 contrast enhanced scan (2x2x3mm), and a high-resolution T1 SPGR scan (1x1x1.5mm). At the 2 scan (6 month after baseline), T1 contrast images showed an active lesion at the left posterior thalamic radiation. This lesion became chronic (normal appearance in T1 contrast scan but hyperintensity in FLAIR scan) since the 3 (9 month) time point with progressively reduced size. A nonlinear registration between the non-diffusion weighted images (b=0) at the baseline and at each of follow-up time points was performed to achieve better spatial registration, followed by reslicing DTI data, adjusting diffusion weighting vectors, artifacts correction and tensor calculation using the FSL package. Lesion masks from the 2 to 4 time points were manually created by an experienced neuroradiologist as the gold standard to evaluate significant changes detected by the proposed approach. Two quantitative measures, True Positive Ration in Lesion (TPR_L) and False Positive Ratio within Non-Lesion white matter (FPR_NL), were calculated as quantitative criteria for evaluation. Results: A smoothing kernel of FWHM=2x2x2voxel was used in estimation of the nonparametric spatial regression model of DTI. To make direct comparisons with the new approach (red asterisk in Fig.1B), the VBM analysis of SPM was performed on both non-smoothed (black cross) and smoothed (blue circles) data. From Fig. 1B, the new method is directly comparable to the VBM approach if multiple scans in each time point were available for conducting a group comparison. ROC curves show that the new method performs better than VBM when the number of scans per group is small (r<5). While the VBM analysis requires at least three repeated DTI measurements at each time point to enable a valid longitudinal comparison of DTI data for a patient, our method, on the other hand, detected significantly decreased FA from only one DTI scan per time point for the MS patient with progressive lesions (Fig.2). Compared to the gold standard lesion mask, the TPR_L values associated with each longitudinal comparison from our method were: 85%, 69% and 70%. The FPR_NL values were 1.6%, 0.8% and 0.7%, well under the acceptable 5% level. Discussion and Conclusions: Imaging data are unique in that they present exquisite spatial details with a large number of voxels for each subject but often with only a small number of subjects or a few follow-ups of each subject due to financial or patient recruitment constraints. Taking advantage of the abundant information of intrinsic spatial correlation in DTI data, we present a statistical analysis approach that can achieve sufficient statistical power for longitudinal analysis of DTI data even for an individual patient with only one DTI acquisition at each longitudinal image exam. When pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease are heterogeneous among population and during disease progression, our method provides a potentially better way to assess individual abnormality by establishing a within-subject baseline to determine more directly how the brain has changed as a result of disease/injury.

92dbd31515a351cb0d7aae42a251f71b7b32de3c,Brain connectivity network modeling using fMRI signals,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most popular noninvasive neuroimaging technologies, which examines human brain at relatively good spatial resolution in both normal and disease states. In addition to the investigation of local neural activity in isolated brain regions, brain connectivity estimated from fMRI has provided a system-level view of brain functions. Despite recent progress on brain connectivity inference, there are still several challenges. Specifically, this thesis focuses on developing novel brain connectivity modeling approaches that can deal with particular challenges of real biomedical applications, including group pattern extraction from a population, false discovery rate control, incorporation of prior knowledge and time-varying brain connectivity network modeling. First, we propose a multi-subject, exploratory brain connectivity modeling approach that allows incorporation of prior knowledge of connectivity and determination of the dominant brain connectivity patterns among a group of subjects. Furthermore, to integrate the genetic information at the population level, a framework for genetically-informed group brain connectivity modeling is developed. We then focus on estimating the time-varying brain connectivity networks. The temporal dynamics of brain connectivity assess the brain in the additional temporal dimension and provide a new perspective to the understanding of brain functions. In this thesis, we develop a sticky weighted time-varying model to investigate the time-dependent brain connectivity networks. As the brain must strike a balance between stability and flexibility, purely assuming that brain connectivity is static or dynamic may be unrealistic. We therefore further propose making joint inference of time-invariant connections and time-varying coupling patterns by employing a",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Aiping Liu"", ids = ""46263537"")",,f544a821130790d4be642ad4b2ae6da45da5c82e;

3d495eaa1cde36aae2dd8671f426ee461932e4ec,Proteomic analysis of articular cartilage vesicles from normal and osteoarthritic cartilage.,"OBJECTIVE
Articular cartilage vesicles (ACVs) are extracellular organelles found in normal articular cartilage. While they were initially defined by their ability to generate pathologic calcium crystals in cartilage of osteoarthritis (OA) patients, they can also alter the phenotype of normal chondrocytes through the transfer of RNA and protein. The purpose of this study was to analyze the proteome of ACVs from normal and OA human cartilage.


METHODS
ACVs were isolated from cartilage samples from 10 normal controls and 10 OA patients. We identified the ACV proteomes using in-gel trypsin digestion, nanospray liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides, followed by searching an appropriate subset of the Uniprot database. We further differentiated between normal and OA ACVs by Holm-Sidak analysis for multiple comparison testing.


RESULTS
More than 1,700 proteins were identified in ACVs. Approximately 170 proteins satisfied our stringent criteria of having >1 representative peptide per protein present, and a false discovery rate of â‰¤5%. These proteins included extracellular matrix components, phospholipid binding proteins, enzymes, and cytoskeletal components, including actin. While few proteins were seen exclusively in normal or OA ACVs, immunoglobulins and complement components were present only in OA ACVs. Compared to normal ACVs, OA ACVs displayed decreases in matrix proteoglycans and increases in transforming growth factor Î²-induced protein Î²ig-H3, DEL-1, vitronectin, and serine protease HtrA1 (P < 0.01).


CONCLUSION
These findings lend support to the concept of ACVs as physiologic structures in articular cartilage. Changes in OA ACVs are largely quantitative and reflect an altered matrix and the presence of inflammation, rather than revealing fundamental changes in composition.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ann K.

0fee1c7ab74fc67edede98aab45dc36d0669e3b8,Improved membrane proteomics coverage of human embryonic stem cells by peptide IPG-IEF.,"Protein biomarkers are fundamental tools for the characterization of stem cells and for tracking their differentiation and maturation down developmental lineages. Technology development allowing increased coverage of difficult cellular proteomes should allow for the discovery of new and novel membrane protein biomarkers for use by the stem cell research community. The amphipathic and highly hydrophobic nature and relative low abundance of many membrane proteins present significant analytical challenges. These difficulties are amplified when the source material (tissue or cells) is only available in limited quantities (e.g., embryonic stem cells). Recent advances in enrichment for purer membrane fractions, the enzymatic and chemical digestion of membrane proteins in the presence of solvents or chaotropes, and the use of ""shotgun"" proteomics methodologies have gradually resulted in increased membrane proteome coverage with numbers of predicted integral membrane proteins now in excess of 1000 being routinely reported. We have recently demonstrated the advantages of using peptide isoelectric focusing in the first dimension on immobilized pH gradients (peptide IPG-IEF) followed by reversed phase chromatography and tandem MS to increase membrane proteome coverage. This study looked at achieving a similar level of membrane proteome coverage using modifications to reported methodologies while restricting the number of characterized human embryonic stem cells to 10(7) cells. Two-thousand two-hundred and ninety-two (2292) nonredundant proteins were identified with two or more high accuracy peptide matches from 260 mug of a human embryonic stem cell membrane enriched fraction with a false discovery rate of 0.32%. Gene Ontology (GO) mapping predicted 1279 (44.9%) of this list to be membrane proteins of which 395 proteins were predicted to be derived from the plasma membrane compartment. The TMHMM algorithm predicted 904 integral membrane proteins with up to 16 transmembrane helices.

08d4b951df7337ea669b11ac3d74f2a6fc2d14bf,Laser-captured microglia in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's brain reveal unique regional expression profiles and suggest a potential role for hepatitis B in the Alzheimer's brain,"Expression array data from dozens of laboratories, including our own, show significant changes in expression of many genes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared with normal controls. These data typically rely on brain homogenates, and information about transcripts specific to microglia and other central nervous system (CNS) cell types, which far outnumber microglia-specific transcripts, is lost. We therefore used single-cell laser capture methods to assess the full range of microglia-specific expression changes that occur in different brain regions (substantia nigra and hippocampus CA1) and disease states (AD, Parkinson's disease, and normal controls). Two novel pathways, neuronal repair and viral processing were identified. Based on KEGG analysis (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, a collection of biological pathways), one of the most significant viruses was hepatitis B virus (HBV) (false discovery rate < 0.00000001). Immunohistochemical analysis using HBV-core antibody in HBV-positive control, amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and HBV-positive AD cases show increased HBV immunoreactivity as disease pathology increases. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to show regional differences in human microglia. In addition, these data reveal new functions for microglia and suggest a novel risk factor for AD.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Diego Mastroeni"", ids = ""6492621""); list(name = ""Jennifer Nolz"", ids = ""40312264""); list(name = ""Shobana Sekar"", ids = ""47471045""); list(name = ""Elaine Delvaux"", ids = ""3738216""); list(name = ""Paul D.

Previous research has suggested that deficits in emotion recognition are involved in the pathogenesis of persecutory delusion in schizophrenia. Although disruption in auditory and language processing is crucial in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the neural basis for the deficits in emotion recognition of auditorily presented language stimuli and its relation to persecutory delusion have not yet been clarified.


Patients and methods
The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study used a dichotic listening task for 15 patients with schizophrenia and 23 healthy controls matched for age, sex, parental socioeconomic background, handedness, dexterous ear, and intelligence quotient. The participants completed a word recognition task on the attended side in which a word with emotionally valenced content (negative/neutral) was presented to one ear and a different neutral word was presented to the other ear. Participants selectively attended to either ear.


Results
The whole brain analysis detected the aberrant neural activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus in the patients with schizophrenia compared to that in the controls (P<0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). Brain activity in the right pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus was significantly reduced when negatively valenced words were presented to the right ear, whereas the activity of the same region was significantly enhanced when these words were presented to the left ear, irrespective of the attended ear, in the participants with schizophrenia compared to the controls. Furthermore, this diminished brain response to auditorily presented negatively valenced words significantly correlated with severe positive symptoms (r=-0.67, P=0.006) and delusional behavior (r=-0.62, P=0.014) in the patients with schizophrenia.


Conclusion
The present results indicate that the significantly impaired brain activity in response to auditorily presented negatively valenced words in the right pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus is associated with the pathogenesis of positive symptoms such as persecutory delusion.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Norichika Iwashiro"", ids = ""2424336""); list(name = ""Yosuke Takano"", ids = ""3333758""); list(name = ""Tatsunobu Natsubori"", ids = ""2191602""); list(name = ""Yuta Y Aoki"", ids = ""40012428""); list(name = ""Noriaki Yahata"", ids = ""48091226""); list(name = ""Wataru Gonoi"", ids = ""49591854""); list(name = ""Akira Kunimatsu"", ids = ""3134060""); list(name = ""Osamu Abe"", ids = ""143815291""); list(name = ""Kiyoto Kasai"", ids = ""2099925""); list(name = ""Hidenori Yamasue"", ids = ""2742983"")",,185fbcc13604dbc88c1d8a9deea4461338991356; 3233bb252eb0f9c2747ebda8df3b5a79a690cb6f; f3006fd5fe8afdc1249d88e5d8f67e2a9b1792cf; 9ab8a5950d6e46fc869bd682132c470c08ffb1b4; 6fc456505aca09846a8d8bf629305d045b2e1fb2; 21b739465b99c1e2eb5e4c1cddc01d29c4f17bcc; c6199ff06d198126e7147cb5842d88623ec14c10; a67f92b5d1bcae3d9e2635410ae958e35ff7c88c; 4902cdfe83c3219dc300cabdf00d1bb50ad0ace6; f8beb25e944004d283e1b347e3473089da244335; 909d7debec4a1c0757c0f5adce07667d44f29579; b4709cb4ec300cba640b5fab41e4104e891255bc; 6f13c63fc5c5ff215100703225373cf2ef35c235; 22039d756174889dcc0210c8d9fee613fbb33ed8; 7af4a21dabb27871a97d6f82b0eb73020d7710dc; 29072faea37f9ee4a3f69231d2a2bf620e996e74; 16478ba0f16c73b2fd5554f164c449e7d7892e5b; ab4cf4d3e60686385932056453c75e533b461f41; a0bb47725db50900fbd6d194e04da65d3ab48090; 083424913eb9042ff74bc8e6ca74261546a80c40; 3aff919ee6fa32db3ce27af0ce7f3606b63e039f; 9465b21fe9075804900b88f069f81f7cb0723fac; 3b85d8be31b336518009d5a2a67a3e505fe4aa2f; 68752a28d7eb518b61e831ad43e5b965af76d8ed; 2055cfc628bf110983fc75966da65ed524389d06; c8cb7dbee5d7d4bbc987c347a9468c2c1dc21f72; 75c2f465d59739dbc06b70fd34dc3c1b2336103e; 89883f48be8f2b91a26c2016e91077ece6670682; 21f8c1f73026be97317a3d7f9c9a7df6fd4f2192; 3d4311366031dcc42b00a2bf199f919709bb6cdf; f50b1ffa2cf83a261adc40cc17d9f7544b46ebf2; 9d22d1dc0010aa16ab57914f132c30a504a3468d; 6dcecbadf202cdb65dadb7a2ae5c52202304b353; 938498f66f6ebdae0b47c594ecce86076de8f3a7; cd3c71a32f6d0474cdf1c18891e925b2d4871789; d423744668a7757eab57a6be6a0b188e8542e85e; e4194d6ddc11d7b95ef337c3dd0083af58eb95f7; 8d61a00aa953fe68359fd516b0f4a82e6af72f33; 2494294303492cc662a2c30def642c4826a98107; fa9512fdf4d4d10697c4eb3e3eafba1cd0e7aec9; 4b21aa69c624d9685b7424976abf883ae325cd67; 55a73fc7f7f6a48d3ce50a2f565bb5aadaa45898; dc8c2a877e53e0465c07cb5baf5f534b2df574c2; 4c37ccf9cbb697298c3af02b0a08d90312aed2a6; 362fe18159a01111b969c346e312d492a3eb6403; 42497adcdd1044b023d448703602e0904d258d90; 7f283786e1ede8c55213d771986e9da82649457c; 757edf0b18cfab12ffff4b04c8fb3082d3de42ad; aaf85a065546be3d68377dc6d1316c2fce0a5642; 313bb713070b279ffb4d196c5fb116a2248042ef; e22468ebaf29fec03033bf6e54d8cb385ed46ef4; b4b5ac9c5217fc001811e7355a8712bbabbe28bf; 3125f037f0e476fb1e489b28d092036958fce8c4; bd1ffd50fc97bd6b8995505d6508cc1055f11213; 097c10fc17043dc6e5ada1f0437e79e3d3696b70; 1d8e78de63ae32ddc22903e197024ab0907c0bed; 762a6dadc18067f61e2a0db64fc83d12942a8f23; 94eb197e25bd9bdcb4bbddf7fc21ed61da380774; 3fde0db355c2c8d7e2358260513fadec49c6ec8f; 578317ce7761ad3b812bcc356e26a5575e21b3bd; 467afbdbefc4c8ee7294d37e41ea36e9d2d969ca; 89d5745ce058e0b0f943b76abd9baf70f97fb0e4; dee2b18e5a502fcfa1f5604d7f9871f57713eb5a; 2e2c41ab097dddf93844483c2b23e7c88928c5a7; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; b5bc27774b6ebf70f92a603c8af3574b47ed4296; 892802dcb9bfa6a27c87def383c3efa7bbeeec75; 6e9b81745d18f365c66e5a57e409bb014e9be942; ea286090eb3c1e70776712482304b513afa007a5; e6d0b8426479070d6f080ef342cbaf6f24fa1082; 165c9dc8b038a382adad029219725a33ed07d051; 0c3716c169e2783423722011c16efd277c1f3813; 6089ff5a7a42e42360ea16c2eedfd3e97766bec9; 7de71978986612d5979d8297e2ea1df96e5ec85c; b3be861f657ede41b1fcf2268c40b06c5fc9b070,Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,15,491 - 502
ce93ba95d614f983aa8e7492245b2a09fab5afb6,Empirical null and false discovery rate analysis in neuroimaging,"Current strategies for thresholding statistical parametric maps in neuroimaging include control of the family-wise error rate, control of the false discovery rate (FDR) and thresholding of the posterior probability of a voxel being active given the data, the latter derived from a mixture model of active and inactive voxels. Correct inference using any of these criteria depends crucially on the specification of the null distribution of the test statistics. In this article we show examples from fMRI and DTI data where the theoretical null distribution does not match well the observed distribution of the test statistics. As a solution, we introduce the use of an empirical null, a null distribution empirically estimated from the data itself, allowing for global corrections of theoretical null assumptions. The theoretical null distributions considered are normal, t, chi(2) and F, all commonly encountered in neuroimaging. The empirical null estimate is accompanied by an estimate of the proportion of non-active voxels in the data.

8936f14f2294fc783b4313609ff1a64efe2ffdfc,Gray Matter Abnormalities in Non-comorbid Medication-naive Patients with Major Depressive Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder,"BACKGROUND
An overlap of clinical symptoms between major depressive disorder (MDD) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) suggests that the two disorders exhibit similar brain mechanisms. However, few studies have directly compared the brain structures of the two disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness alterations between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients.


METHODS
High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid SAD patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs). Voxel-based morphometry analysis of the GMV (corrected with a false discovery rate of p<0.001) and vertex-based analysis of cortical thickness (corrected with a clusterwise probability of p<0.001) were performed, and group differences were compared by ANOVA followed by post hoc tests.


OUTCOMES
Relative to the HCs, both the MDD patients and SAD patients showed the following results: GMV reductions in the bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), putamen, and thalamus; cortical thickening in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, left temporal pole, and right superior parietal cortex; and cortical thinning in the left lateral OFC and bilateral rostral middle frontal cortex. In addition, MDD patients specifically showed a greater thickness in the left fusiform gyrus and right lateral occipital cortex and a thinner thickness in the bilateral lingual and left cuneus. SAD patients specifically showed a thinner cortical thickness in the right precentral cortex.


INTERPRETATION
Our results indicate that MDD and SAD share common patterns of gray matter abnormalities in the orbitofrontal-striatal-thalamic circuit, salience network and dorsal attention network. These consistent structural differences in the two patient groups may contribute to the broad spectrum of emotional, cognitive and behavioral disturbances observed in MDD patients and SAD patients. In addition, we found disorder-specific involvement of the visual processing regions in MDD and the precentral cortex in SAD. These findings provide new evidence regarding the shared and specific neuropathological mechanisms that underlie MDD and SAD.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Youjin Zhao"", ids = ""7637061""); list(name = ""Lizhou Chen"", ids = ""3107081""); list(name = ""Wenjing Zhang"", ids = ""38902771""); list(name = ""Yuan Xiao"", ids = ""143964385""); list(name = ""Chandan Shah"", ids = ""50383864""); list(name = ""Hongru Zhu"", ids = ""7296567""); list(name = ""Minlan Yuan"", ids = ""4540672""); list(name = ""Huaiqiang Sun"", ids = ""4527613""); list(name = ""Qiang Yue"", ids = ""50595062""); list(name = ""Zhiyun Jia"", ids = ""2417776""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""50549738""); list(name = ""Weihong Kuang"", ids = ""4972663""); list(name = ""Qiyong Gong"", ids = ""143838620""); list(name = ""Su Lui"", ids = ""145965433"")",2d097baffae39702fc07a6e6c88b4b465101458f; c3cbe55a526b51237d67bb212f5aaa2ecca80124; 8fffd0b41a1c4ba1011e86f52cc60e87bf3110f6; 5723b48c23293e73af1d1fb7626cbf76bdd06521; 3dd5219e37de1f1ff243565e43dcd03e548a4a2b; 2267e159135b948e9cdba1b39b010316ba827b12; 256c67bd1446c3e09a1b95b1c5e8d4a29fdcc6ae; 7b7547be53a900d4875a7c55e9019e1ff2550845; aa83cdd9a129d6ad2bc7f8577b54bba129f5b899; b42eb4caa6c6834d5107067abddc9bf5d12b5166; 00a79c18125ccfa578cf0abcbf7dc3bf2b4c4400; e073eddfe36495c6517ffb16fb5991d407944248; 8ba16f1a09759d619db6b4135f8a9ade9f994eac,f3dc95c15a3105f92c959e521b8f8f07bf995fa7; 999e8d33b7e22eac6638687429809b7483361bc6; a602c330bc2f189135e2e37e8ab0474b378a89a5; c15dab459cec8c11e8f78d35478bda9126f15c06; 0af9622d0173dac2618d46bde247408ffcd223cd; 055411f28a5e28c46c3f0079d397783afc721021; 2b25647999dcaf5830a217d53bef0399da8f92f3; c86fcf3cc4ceaa8d8039d1f6efd65fab9af4d1a6; cd309ca6d59e8ddfc6f24933f1a56a4197e27bb1; 3e18ea96adccfff1bf2a5bf0967f401b370dab59; 9215668b672e7bb53e08f4e1cdeaf8291565f8da; 414fef9642f69c94d719afa65fd8faa3d28e96c9; 9ce36f6e8cf0e0eed784c2855f6a6e7091a3dce9; 600a161f4123d4f7a90f38d2a847328ce9a83065; d952f480bc947c879c64e69ed52ef6ebdd11c82e; d3eb47ed074ee5ca1f7a4fbb1e27c66d78b0b1f7; 9b457dd399c8e117b400e01e9360684ce30d4973; a735d4ea3bd1af74daa118a943a2a62a71c00f0d; 21b65bbf11bc246a80b7f08043db3ff5c0844e91; dc964883df045047778dec60160ef78f3ccdc30c; 193d58c67d5006d081919bb9477c796fd0deba00; 8a0c2b377bfea184efc266f5155d015612203389; 80e522c62eecc8c722aa2fa5f55f1c47fc026600; 3dd93484a3fac2afa67157323cc8396b61d46520; 5c977cef17ef87df880e2304416a8ddb03d3020e; 80acc30290aafaff1fd87bde704364e48dc05112; 931ece0ebfd2c9a534c9f6e3264fa74f62c0e203; bb390ec8ef91acd9f35c713491cb1c3f895da607; aa3e94b583ba17c7b757ec38873cbdf683329b37; cb55817422872088a352c2db83f0c68ca65383a8; b3629e697bfc9c7c8fc015062cc94389f82607ec; 9251fbf95a9c2a05169da2d91a71c5cd7e467ac9; 116f12c03bc4b2b6cb59d896a3d25919e5829866; 985778755f6f7d16440a80a89f01272d54d47c91; 6d28a6b4f337649fedaac38c3f31d2af66f89aee; 01f10f6fe1957e4790004b8429e4aa4eaa45b26c; ad4e281293237bdb8efbbd639ac823536815f42b; fcb553010bee2727f10f251352b64f7576666b1a; 3ed9387b65f0b152c919c320111359ee8b7c92a7; 7760520426b65ced6621a5d274f94269d1f33615; 46bd06e678d1a6fb8fa88590cc34549b15de1641; 7c59da9318ece78717d5637860b19b1a2f4ef0b0; 71c7a7f6e80bd0094e9b494b5eb702853aa92408; e609cdbac646e4e40aa91209cb1e9327af5c5219; fddf920be4a55aa1720bf86b61476c9c28fc8e4b; 902284220459fd0a53cd757b5f26218ddaadb481; 6bb82d48a5bb627a307441c1eb45e02903704c53; 79b6680d346590801fe9b80522eff061b7bb2667; 2ae051329fd5ff7e7a5bc7edb920e43d5fe8ce8c; 3d2c23c6334fe7695c7101b4728f0dedb24e5d1b; 0c9ee5e6902a6168ef38c5901ba19014da9bef17; af3f2ecdf85585481eb09238a14d77b7d15f56e7; 97a0089d7456429b9726d3735ee22d0d9e35176a; d8c44b1cd38a27c78af9c9444d8be019e2f26417; bd159f4464c45ea2a3a89a253ee5b0e2a5a6cbae; 487336621ac47adc32aaa1b3008075a8670ea876; ebd0ff82ffd3093395afb0f32645a43d1c07730f; 30a2ff1494aa2f65c6b0c26459d973422b69ef73; 78f59bbd638fe961c7b1f53604bee3a09e7986a8; 5a5db97d488a44e6017a6425652c1f3993e407ee; 2861c24bc829f963a594a5916a9ce9616b6486d7; b057ba83c790d6c16e7b032aa06978ce5bd43ed4,EBioMedicine,21,228 - 235

This results in a considerable reduction of overall false-positive rates for protein identifications; the overall false discovery rates in yeast are reduced from near 25% to less than 1%, and the false discovery rate of yeast single-peptide protein identifications becomes negligible. This technique can be employed by laboratories utilizing a SEQUEST-based proteomic analysis platform, incorporating the XTandem algorithm as a complementary tool for verification of single-peptide protein identifications.

0c7cd9da7593c403cd5af03cfd33b7191897ec15,Heritability enrichment of specifically expressed genes identifies disease-relevant tissues and cell types,"We introduce an approach to identify disease-relevant tissues and cell types by analyzing gene expression data together with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Our approach uses stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to test whether disease heritability is enriched in regions surrounding genes with the highest specific expression in a given tissue. We applied our approach to gene expression data from several sources together with GWAS summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits (average Nâ€‰=â€‰169,331) and found significant tissue-specific enrichments (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰5%) for 34 traits. In our analysis of multiple tissues, we detected a broad range of enrichments that recapitulated known biology. In our brain-specific analysis, significant enrichments included an enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder, and excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index. Our results demonstrate that our polygenic approach is a powerful way to leverage gene expression data for interpreting GWAS signals.A new method tests whether disease heritability is enriched near genes with high tissue-specific expression.

2b9e448b2bf7efc4aa18bdd3d3cf31f30652d728,Abstract A08: Using directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells and gene expression profiling to characterize the cell of origin of neuroblastoma,"Purpose: Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common childhood tumors, accounting for ~15% of all pediatric cancer deaths. Improved neuroblastoma disease modeling is needed to improve our understanding and ultimately lead to the development of more effective therapies. NB is an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system believed to arise from sympathoadrenal (SA) precursor cells belonging to the primitive neural crest. Because the neural crest is a transient embryologic structure, there have been few studies comparing NB tumors to normal human neural crest stem cells (NCSC). However, recent advances have enabled the in vitro differentiation of neural crest cells from pluripotent stem cells. We compared gene expression profiles of pluripotent stem cells, NCSC, and NB tumors to characterize the gene expression profile of the putative cell of origin of NB as the first step in the development of a human NCSC based model of NB. Methods: Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated to early NCSC and SA precursors in vitro using modifications of previously published protocols. Specifically, undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell GFP reporter and iPS cell lines were induced to differentiate into SA cells in a sequential, stepwise manner over the course of ~4 weeks. After differentiation, SA precursors were identified by expression of the lineage-specific transcription factors ASCL1 and PHOX2B, as well as other markers including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). We subsequently compared the gene expression profiles of these cells to early, multi-potent neural crest stem cells, autonomic and enteric neurons, 12 NB cell lines and 39 non-MYCN amplified primary NB tumors (3 stage 1, 5 stage 2, 3 stage 3, 24 stage 4, and 4 stage 4S) using Illumina HT-12 bead arrays. These profiles were also compared to the gene expression profiles of laser-capture microdissected fetal adrenal neuroblasts previously reported by De Preter et. al. (Genome Biology 2006, 7:R84). Results were normalized using quantile normalization and analyzed with principle components analysis (PCA); differential expression analysis was performed using the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) method. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID annotation tools and cross-platform normalization was performed using the CONOR package in the R software program. All analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons and results considered significant when False Discovery Rate (FDR) was Results: PCA showed that undifferentiated iPS cells and early NCSC cluster relatively closely together and away from primary tumors and fetal adrenal neuroblasts. The NB cell lines and primary tumors do not cluster closely together suggesting there are significant differences between them. Gene expression profiles of in vitro differentiated ASCL1 and PHOX2B(+) SA precursor cells were similar to fetal adrenal neuroblasts and more closely resembled NB tumors than did earlier multi-potent NCSC. Comparison between SA precursor cells, NCSC, and primary tumors identified numerous differentially expressed genes (FDR Conclusions: This study, the first of its kind for this disease, demonstrates the feasibility and potential utility of using human pluripotent stem cells and in vitro derived sympathoadrenal precursors cells to simulate early NB pathogenesis. Gene expression profiling of NB identified down regulation of multiple developmentally important genes of normal neural crest differentiation. Further refinement of this in vitro neuroblastoma tumor model as well as investigations of its disrupted gene pathways is underway. Note: This abstract was not presented at the conference.

63179b27b02f7f4d1aaa2a7e62c58fbba3fa54bc,Genome-Wide Association Mapping of Loci for Resistance to Stripe Rust in North American Elite Spring Wheat Germplasm.,"Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is a major yield-limiting foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. In this study, the genetic variability of elite spring wheat germplasm from North America was investigated to characterize the genetic basis of effective all-stage and adult plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust. A genome-wide association study was conducted using 237 elite spring wheat lines genotyped with an Illumina Infinium 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism array. All-stage resistance was evaluated at seedling stage in controlled conditions and field evaluations were conducted under natural disease pressure in eight environments across Washington State. High heritability estimates and correlations between infection type and severity were observed. Ten loci for race-specific all-stage resistance were confirmed from previous mapping studies. Three potentially new loci associated with race-specific all-stage resistance were identified on chromosomes 1D, 2A, and 5A. For APR, 11 highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) (false discovery rate < 0.01) were identified, of which 3 QTL on chromosomes 3A, 5D, and 7A are reported for the first time. The QTL identified in this study can be used to enrich the current gene pool and improve the diversity of resistance to stripe rust disease.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jayfred Gaham Godoy"", ids = ""36913624""); list(name = ""Sheri Rynearson"", ids = ""8110033""); list(name = ""Xianming Chen"", ids = ""1767481""); list(name = ""Michael O.

e14863d8a594f622f0b5c84e9f220720e398a5b5,Dfam: a database of repetitive DNA based on profile hidden Markov models,"We present a database of repetitive DNA elements, called Dfam (http://dfam.janelia.org). Many genomes contain a large fraction of repetitive DNA, much of which is made up of remnants of transposable elements (TEs). Accurate annotation of TEs enables research into their biology and can shed light on the evolutionary processes that shape genomes. Identification and masking of TEs can also greatly simplify many downstream genome annotation and sequence analysis tasks. The commonly used TE annotation tools RepeatMasker and Censor depend on sequence homology search tools such as cross_match and BLAST variants, as well as Repbase, a collection of known TE families each represented by a single consensus sequence. Dfam contains entries corresponding to all Repbase TE entries for which instances have been found in the human genome. Each Dfam entry is represented by a profile hidden Markov model, built from alignments generated using RepeatMasker and Repbase. When used in conjunction with the hidden Markov model search tool nhmmer, Dfam produces a 2.9% increase in coverage over consensus sequence search methods on a large human benchmark, while maintaining low false discovery rates, and coverage of the full human genome is 54.5%. The website provides a collection of tools and data views to support improved TE curation and annotation efforts.

f8eed0db448fa851dcdc9e349da8da68a34d54ad,Depressive symptom severity is associated with increased cortical thickness in older adults.,"OBJECTIVE
Structural neuroimaging studies in older adults have consistently shown volume reductions in both major and subthreshold depression. Cortical thickness, another measure of brain structure, has not been well studied in this population. We examined cortical thickness in older adults across a range of depressive symptom (DS) severity.


METHODS
Forty-three community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 68.80 Â± 7.00 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Based on a priori hypotheses, we examined cortical thickness in regions of interest in the rostral anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and isthmus cingulate using multiple linear regressions with depression questionnaire scores as the independent variable and age, sex, and mean hemispheric thickness as covariates. We also performed an exploratory vertex-wise analysis.


RESULTS
After correction for multiple comparisons, we found an association between increased DSs and greater cortical thickness in the right isthmus cingulate (F(1, 38)â€‰= 8.09, false discovery rate corrected p = 0.028; R(2) = 35.78) in the region of interest analysis and in the left precuneus (cluster size = 413, p = 0.00002) in the vertex-wise analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Older adults with higher DSs also have greater cortical thickness in the isthmus cingulate and precuneus, areas important for emotion regulation and self-referential processing. Additional research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and potential clinical significance underlying this relationship.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah M Szymkowicz"", ids = ""4181706""); list(name = ""Molly E.

In a typical microarray experiment, the number of biological samples is quite modest compared with the number of genes on a microarray, and a probability of falsely declaring differential expression is unacceptably high without any adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, a stringent multiple comparison procedure can lead to an unacceptably high false negative rate, potentially missing a large fraction of truly differentially expressed genes. In this paper we propose a new â€œbalancing factor scoreâ€ (BFS ) method for identifying a set of differentially expressed genes. The BFS method combines a traditional P value criterion with any other informative factors (referred to as balancing factors) that may help to identify differentially expressed genes. We evaluate the performance of the BFS method when the observed fold change is used as a balancing factor in a simulation study and show that the BFS method can substantially reduce the false negative rate while maintaining a reasonable false discovery rate.",2010,,"list(name = ""Byung Suk Park"", ids = ""48190862""); list(name = ""Motomi Mori"", ids = ""51480724"")",,21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 652e0fbc0b202ca8deecce939856548120fd3cca; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 0d04d5101a308f961946f6adece668ed05beab32; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 2acf78dd4106f9fe0a1d025cc757d2addf24fb9a,,,

Methods We compared the ability of baseline CSF &bgr;-amyloid1â€“42, tau, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations, measured by INNO-BIA AlzBio3 or ELISA, to predict 52-week changes in clinical (PSP Rating Scale [PSPRS] and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living [SEADL]), neuropsychological, and regional brain volumes on MRI using linear mixed effects models controlled for age, sex, and baseline disease severity, and Fisher F density curves to compare effect sizes in 50 patients with PSP. Similar analyses were done using plasma NfL measured by single molecule arrays in 141 patients. Results Higher CSF NfL concentration predicted more rapid decline (biomarker Ã— time interaction) over 52 weeks in PSPRS (p = 0.004, false discovery rateâ€“corrected) and SEADL (p = 0.008), whereas lower baseline CSF p-tau predicted faster decline on PSPRS (p = 0.004). Higher CSF tau concentrations predicted faster decline by SEADL (p = 0.004). The CSF NfL/p-tau ratio was superior for predicting change in PSPRS, compared to p-tau (p = 0.003) or NfL (p = 0.001) alone. Higher NfL concentrations in CSF or blood were associated with greater superior cerebellar peduncle atrophy (fixed effect, p â©½ 0.029 and 0.008, respectively). Conclusions Both CSF p-tau and NfL correlate with disease severity and rate of disease progression in PSP. The inverse correlation of p-tau with disease severity suggests a potentially different mechanism of tau pathology in PSP as compared to Alzheimer disease.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Julio C.

1f2095009d00114f5fc21ced5e144f1e2f158587,Estimation of Mediation Effect for High-dimensional Omics Mediators with Application to the Framingham Heart Study,"Environmental exposures can regulate intermediate molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, by different mechanisms and thereby lead to various health outcomes. It is of significant scientific interest to unravel the role of potentially high-dimensional intermediate phenotypes in the relationship between environmental exposure and traits. Mediation analysis is an important tool for investigating such relationships. However, it has mainly focused on low-dimensional settings, and there is a lack of a good measure of the total mediation effect. Here, we extend an R-squared (Rsq) effect size measure, originally proposed in the single-mediator setting, to the moderate- and high-dimensional mediator settings in the mixed model framework. Based on extensive simulations, we compare our measure and estimation procedure with several frequently used mediation measures, including product, proportion, and ratio measures. Our Rsq measure has small bias and variance under the correctly specified model. To mitigate potential bias induced by non-mediators, we examine two variable selection procedures, i.e., iterative sure independence screening and false discovery rate control, to exclude the non-mediators. We evaluate the consistency of the proposed estimation procedures and introduce a resampling-based confidence interval. By applying the proposed estimation procedure, we find that more than half of the aging-related variations in systolic blood pressure can be explained by gene expression profiles in the Framingham Heart Study.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Tianzhong Yang"", ids = ""11844449""); list(name = ""Jing-bo Niu"", ids = ""15668130""); list(name = ""Han Wen Chen"", ids = ""94377724""); list(name = ""Peng Wei"", ids = ""144537866"")",,62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; 428530990060133f6d362694d89a154223bd1fa0; 97510e2048af0c6c510aed405091514946c4eb13; 73039d92be7787bc8f683cd17d0b418bed9edadf; 11f4297c9c9e940bfe30bbbdb37565a84871ecbc; 2d5a5ebec5ba2fe3ee20975bd8472156510d79bb; ce3876596b7d1884bf79e578025b2ced03891ff0; 602d2e795f3678f774b04e5092fa7a94a7ee323c; 0b147933b8d1b7b896640749e79592f65a66f9fb; a0bcf22ac06a45c48a2bf4bf196327d7ec6acb03; 24db02cd419238b91650f7c4492b5dfe329f88b1; 7a74037c195bab9c2ccf0f2e960d2350a2adc977; fc94aa1521e160b4daaeba5ed1a12dd437d7901c; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 7a3a81eba3edf166622df6865d42bfc70139cc35; a282c1d0bcad3dbb1aab6f89fe85e46098c4d487; bb4d8744a437c16d6cf1ccd31ad63584dd652f5f; 0288992ffb0c673de215cdb53cc0ae8c69cd89f6; 589e2086a1ca4ac3cea3eb296caa26473eaa3287; 15b87482d0eff2cebe99e117c1ed2e734c18cf2f; 523e123e725264a8847d2e409af3fae78d48d96e; fb1985bc004de785205d4cdbe5f0c82e4a6ac4dc; dd932e66b1e345ef643cb71666bcd70ded6f337c; 86541bb4ab97a0b99193ff3bb6051a55d3e67b0c; e503221c093f35c8676fcd0bf9ae4068a97877d4; c7a90c2b5df449424eaf2444f1823d78050846ce; 32d1671ab3cf27b3653b0aff96c91778478df7d6; 329cc441d427c1c7a2f98efaf3877c31ed3c3edb; c1dad5822b1e635af593b5aeb887a06358b299a9; 2dfd4bdcf53215a88599651441351138f99089b6; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 70651d7a780c23cb6a0b2fdd935c9b93182190b2; cec775be96a4cedc1982a58ff1b3b07cf33aa214; c14194bb9bc01767eb0f966cc8f8414e069d1c41,bioRxiv,,
213357d39566e6ccc458c010bd15193a29a4b53f,Transcriptional regulation on the gene expression signature in combined allergic rhinitis and asthma syndrome.,"AIM
This study was intended to evaluate transcriptional regulation of gene expression signatures in combined allergic rhinitis and asthma syndrome (CARAS).


MATERIALS & METHODS
The blood samples of three patients with CARAS, three patients with allergic rhinitis and three normal controls were obtained. The cuffdiff, miRDeep2 and DEGseq were used to quantify the expression of genes and miRNAs, respectively. And p-valueÂ <Â 0.01 and false discovery rate < 0.001 were considered as significant differences of genes and miRNAs, respectively. Gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were used to analyze the biological function. And the cut-off value for significance was pÂ <Â 0.05.


RESULTS
SLC14A1, SNCA, TNS1, KAT2B and PARP1 were regulated by hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-21-5p. Additionally, phagosome (pÂ =Â 0.00627769839083361) was the only significantly enriched signal pathway involving HLA-DOA, TUBB2A and MRC2.


CONCLUSION
Disordered expression of genes under the regulation of miRNAs may play an important role in CARAS.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhengdao Mao"", ids = ""33251105""); list(name = ""Yujia Shi"", ids = ""8738712""); list(name = ""Qi Cao"", ids = ""144457383""); list(name = ""Yi Chen"", ids = ""1684836""); list(name = ""Yun Sun"", ids = ""37968235""); list(name = ""Zhiguang Liu"", ids = ""2820284""); list(name = ""Qian Zhang"", ids = ""46324597""); list(name = ""Mao Huang"", ids = ""39658865"")",b4345c682b2720a0184dfc2da2e1a2bf9cb9e62a; c2e1d4220bd1af9b509707777dfed17a8682dff5; 8e6a9ceafce1e44b6144c156f4d7ca509e38c4af,,Epigenomics,10 2,"

ef355e87584fac6214d78e4b1971d3a81eaa3738,Plasma metabolomics reveal the correlation of metabolic pathways and Prakritis of humans,"BACKGROUND
Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medicinal system, has categorized human body constitutions in three broad constitutional types (prakritis) i.e. Vata, Pitta and Kapha.


OBJECTIVES
Analysis of plasma metabolites and related pathways to classify Prakriti specific dominant marker metabolites and metabolic pathways.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
38 healthy male individuals were assessed for dominant Prakritis and their fasting blood samples were collected. The processed plasma samples were subjected to rapid resolution liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-ESI-QTOFMS). Mass profiles were aligned and subjected to multivariate analysis.


RESULTS
Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model showed 97.87% recognition capability. List of PLS-DA metabolites was subjected to permutative Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction and final list of 76 metabolites with pÂ <Â 0.05 and fold-changeÂ >Â 2.0 was identified. Pathway analysis using metascape and JEPETTO plugins in Cytoscape revealed that steroidal hormone biosynthesis, amino acid, and arachidonic acid metabolism are major pathways varying with different constitution. Biological Go processes analysis showed that aromatic amino acids, sphingolipids, and pyrimidine nucleotides metabolic processes were dominant in kapha type of body constitution. Fat soluble vitamins, cellular amino acid, and androgen biosynthesis process along with branched chain amino acid and glycerolipid catabolic processes were dominant in pitta type individuals. Vata Prakriti was found to have dominant catecholamine, arachidonic acid and hydrogen peroxide metabolomics processes.


CONCLUSION
The neurotransmission and oxidative stress in vata, BCAA catabolic, androgen, xenobiotics metabolic processes in pitta, and aromatic amino acids, sphingolipid, and pyrimidine metabolic process in kapha Prakriti were the dominant marker pathways.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Amey Shirolkar"", ids = ""3971028""); list(name = ""Sutapa Chakraborty"", ids = ""51054542""); list(name = ""Tusharkanti Mandal"", ids = ""32204386""); list(name = ""Rajesh Dabur"", ids = ""4669735"")",2ddec17c81cdfd9180abfcab7da7bc60cd9fa0e2; 10f6c302824bc6443b1658122ea3a54b9a6f646b,f2845217d190045e4eca2978545999dd7ff7fdec; 6aae2d845bba0d5cc2a8e06d5ab65806400b1601; 2174278c590704f3771237baabc897f97fd97283; a285b267f87667148dd9115310511e2f4b343f16; 9d95adc8a41b502d669994207e4ab60be99fe000; 5d96c224b259fa94eeb624b8e0413fa0b2d8f2cc; a38537a15a95d08c156cfdfcdb6303df60309065; 7c84f416fb9ff89dd4dbd889316bc57223744435; bce23ac11ed3e7d96453674ceb34a297460278a2; 056f9b08b38cbe33a8b21c92dabe89182f1bc6a6; 85069608eb3d8cd6b6fdc8da97865df61db46a6b; 5a2154aa34c409d7d94a4b8003a514b8fa1ab88b; e6367c40d48cfa9f08e20ad4a007a8f90344cce9; bf5ceedb739be8c4fc62663e851ddc28312c7bc4; 2f6c95df0c23328a3c40608e5bc71808b8b418fa; a18c356fb838993b775a9ef8fd29875ac483899b; db1b0ffe31e2bb17d3b6c05240eb0bdc65fbb7e8; b8120199704ed417c73834f53f8657fad94b96cf; c221accd0c611ba020c8c079d63ff3bb71f572b4; 6a2083b0698edb61004f9fa867cc2b096ddaab09,Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine,9,113 - 122
165fe96247bd2c2daa79c67efc9316700afa5c4a,Post-acquisition ETD spectral processing for increased peptide identifications,"Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) produced using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) differ from those derived from collision-activated dissociation (CAD) in several important ways. Foremost, the predominant fragment ion series are different: c- and zÂ·-type ions are favored in ETD spectra while b- and y-type ions comprise the bulk of the fragments in CAD spectra. Additionally, ETD spectra possess charge-reduced precursors and unique neutral losses. Most database search algorithms were designed to analyze CAD spectra, and have only recently been adapted to accommodate c- and zÂ·-type ions; therefore, inclusion of these additional spectral features can hinder identification, leading to lower confidence scores and decreased sensitivity. Because of this, it is important to pre-process spectral data before submission to a database search to remove those features that cause complications. Here, we demonstrate the effects of removing these features on the number of unique peptide identifications at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using the open mass spectrometry search algorithm (OMSSA). When analyzing two biologic replicates of a yeast protein extract in three total analyses, the number of unique identifications with a âˆ¼1% FDR increased from 4611 to 5931 upon spectral pre-processingâ€”an increase of âˆ¼28. 6%.

dd22ebb2ab73549203d8d50fa453ced5ff93045c,Genome-wide pathway analysis of folate-responsive genes to unravel the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting in man.,"BACKGROUND
A cleft of the lip with or without the palate (CLP) is a frequent congenital malformation with a heterogeneous etiology, for which folic acid supplementation has a protective effect. To gain more insight into the molecular pathways affected by natural folate, we examined gene expression profiles of cultured B-lymphoblasts from CLP patients before and after the addition of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-mTHF) to the cultures.


METHODS
Immortalized B-lymphoblasts from five children with CLP were cultured in folate-deficient medium for 5 days. 5-mTHF was added to a concentration of 30 nM. Gene expression patterns were then evaluated before and after supplementation using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Data analysis was performed with Omniviz and the GEPAS analysis suite. Differential genes were categorized into biological pathways with Ingenuity Pathway systems. Differential expression was validated by quantitative RT-PCR.


RESULTS
Using supervised clustering, with a false discovery rate <1%, we identified 144 and 409 significantly up-regulated and down-regulated probesets, respectively, after 5-mTHF addition. The regulated genes were involved in a variety of biological pathways, including one carbon pool and cell cycle regulation, biosynthesis of amino acids and DNA/RNA nucleotides, protein processing, apoptosis, and DNA repair.


CONCLUSIONS
The large variety of the identified folate responsive pathways fits with the modifying role of folate via the methylation pathway. From the present data we may conclude that folate deficiency deranges normal cell development, which might contribute to the development of CLP. The role of these folate responsive genes in CLP development is intriguing and needs further investigation.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bart J. B.

Two samples were collected from 48 patients during AAA surgery. One sample was collected from the aneurysm, the other from the aneurysm proximal neck where the tissue did not exhibit any aneurysmal changes. Subsequently, gene expression profiles using microarrays (Illumina) were compared in RNA extracted from the samples. Overall, 2,185 genes were found to be upregulated and 2,100 downregulated; from which 158 genes had a different expression with FDR<0.05 (False Discovery Rate) and FC>/=2 (Fold Change). Of this number, 115 genes were over-expressed and 43 under-expressed. The analysis of the gene list based on their biological pathways revealed that the regulation of inflammation was mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways, the integrin signaling pathway, and T and B cell activation.

We describe in this chapter a rather generic way to achieve this goal.

cc5b896db8ba48abb9e663e51235eca4741e2bd9,Longitudinal Relationships between Caloric Expenditure and Gray Matter in the Cardiovascular Health Study,"BACKGROUND
Physical activity (PA) can be neuroprotective and reduce the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In assessing physical activity, caloric expenditure is a proxy marker reflecting the sum total of multiple physical activity types conducted by an individual.


OBJECTIVE
To assess caloric expenditure, as a proxy marker of PA, as a predictive measure of gray matter (GM) volumes in the normal and cognitively impaired elderly persons.


METHODS
All subjects in this study were recruited from the Institutional Review Board approved Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a multisite population-based longitudinal study in persons aged 65 and older. We analyzed a sub-sample of CHS participants 876 subjects (mean age 78.3, 57.5% F, 42.5% M) who had i) energy output assessed as kilocalories (kcal) per week using the standardized Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities questionnaire, ii) cognitive assessments for clinical classification of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, and iii) volumetric MR imaging of the brain. Voxel-based morphometry modeled the relationship between kcal/week and GM volumes while accounting for standard covariates including head size, age, sex, white matter hyperintensity lesions, MCI or AD status, and site. Multiple comparisons were controlled using a False Discovery Rate of 5 percent.


RESULTS
Higher energy output, from a variety of physical activity types, was associated with larger GM volumes in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as hippocampus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. High levels of caloric expenditure moderated neurodegeneration-associated volume loss in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and cerebellar vermis.


CONCLUSION
Increasing energy output from a variety of physical activities is related to larger gray matter volumes in the elderly, regardless of cognitive status.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Cyrus A.

In Genomics for instance, it is now commonplace for experiments to measure expression levels in thousands of genes creating large multiplicity problems when thousands of hypotheses are to be tested simultaneously. Within this context we seek to identify differentially expressed genes, that is, genes whose expression levels are associated with a particular response or covariate of interest. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is the preferred measure since the Family Wise Error Rates (FWERs) are usually overly restrictive. In the FDR methods, estimation of the proportion of null hypotheses (Ï€0) is an important parameter that needs to be estimated. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of 12 methods for estimating Ï€0 when the test statistics are continuous using simulated data with independent, weak dependence, and moderate dependence structures.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Isaac Dialsingh"", ids = ""2931072""); list(name = ""Sherwin P Cedeno"", ids = ""71723285"")",,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; e2be29d1869fb220d65b99b1a9e145d8301d6cf2; fbf14c88d94febe28d375b07a27594e77381bf6a; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; adf6e7b34fedb688d3e20def1341c2816a7c67b4; 4c2fcb1f52418c8889afb47dd314dded059de907; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 220d19025c70489a87b139e7fa368dab588cb490,Journal of biometrics & biostatistics,8,
9286363f0af77f21d68e84831aa83c359900430e,Widespread cortical thinning is a robust anatomical marker for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"OBJECTIVE
This cross-sectional study sought to confirm the presence and regional profile of previously reported changes in laminar cortical thickness in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared with typically developing control subjects.


METHOD
High-resolution magnetic resonance images were obtained from 22 (19 male and 3 female subjects; mean age 11.7 years) children and adolescents with ADHD and 22 age- and sex-matched control subjects (mean age 11.7 years). Brain tissue volumes were estimated for each subject. Cortical pattern matching methods were used to sample measures of laminar thickness at high spatial frequency across homologous regions of the cortex. Volume and thickness measures were compared across diagnostic groups with and without controlling for general intelligence. False discovery rate correction confirmed regional results.


RESULTS
The subjects with ADHD exhibited significant reductions in overall brain volume, gray matter volume, and mean cortical thickness compared with the controls, whereas white matter volumes were significantly increased in ADHD. Highly significant cortical thinning (false discovery rate-corrected p < .0006) was observed over large areas of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital association cortices and aspects of motor cortex but not within the primary sensory regions.


CONCLUSIONS
Cortical thickness reductions present a robust neuroanatomical marker for child and adolescent ADHD. Observations of widespread cortical thinning expand on earlier cross-sectional findings and provide further evidence to support that the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD extend beyond prefrontal and subcortical circuits.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katherine Narr"", ids = ""1924772""); list(name = ""Roger P.

The gene expression analysis was performed again using the new release of the Transcriptome Analysis Consoleâ„¢ (version 4.0.1, Life Technologies â€“ not available at the time our initial study was conducted), which integrates the Limma differential expression portion of the Bioconductor package. Overall similar results were obtained regarding the number of genes differentially expressed and the enrichment of genes in different Gene Ontology (GO) categories. The transcriptomic profiles induced in response to the three OH-derivatives were shown, again, to be similar to those induced by inhibitors of the brassinosteroid synthesis (i.e., brassinazole, propiconazole, and uniconazole), potentially resulting in iron deficiency in exposed plants. The new (and improved) method used for the selection of differentially expressed genes did not change the conclusion of our initial study, which suggested that the higher phytotoxicity of OH-derivatives, as compared to the parent compound 2,5-dichlorobiphenyl (2,5-DCB), may be explained by the inhibition of the brassinosteroid synthesis pathway.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""BenoÃ®t Van Aken"", ids = ""3537944"")",,,International Journal of Phytoremediation,22,224 - 225

As a result, empirical use of antibiotics is necessary. A biochemical marker of ABM would facilitate precise clinical diagnosis and management of these infections and enable rational use of antibiotics. We used label-free protein quantification by mass spectrometry to Methods. identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that distinguish ABM (n=37) from CM (n=22) in Kenyan children. Fold change (FC) and false discovery rates (FDR) were used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Subsequently, potential biomarkers were assessed for their ability to discriminate between ABM and CM using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The host CSF proteome response to ABM ( Results. Haemophilus influenza and ) is significantly different to CM. Fifty two Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins were differentially expressed (FDR<0.01, Log FCâ‰¥2), of which 83% (43/52) were upregulated in ABM compared to CM. Myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin were present in 37 (100%) and 36 (97%) of ABM cases, respectively, but absent in CM (n=22). Area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were assessed for myeloperoxidase (1, 1, and 1; 95% CI, 1-1) and lactotransferrin (0.98, 0.97, and 1; 95% CI, 0.96-1). Myeloperoxidase and lactotransferrin have a high potential to Conclusion. distinguish ABM from CM and thereby improve clinical management. Their validation requires a larger cohort of samples that includes other bacterial aetiologies of ABM. 1 1,2 1 1,3 1 1,4 1,5",2017,,"list(name = ""Clarissa Valim"", ids = ""3033699"")",37e9fb562209c622b6f81624a64b1c2c51d8f88f,9dc1c19a68499c21d9df8e785b175dda7d7477a9; 7e1d455cc0291acadef4112eacabe0d5cdb7fdc5; 4093873cdb8fe836e23b91598e3918c8f5498fa6; 17a75300d2e5b6d7c39dde43fddb5185913ee3aa; 73eb777e465b64a82c9bb33d37f34c29c02cc63e; 64c338fbad4f2bd3ac0eccb59224a416cac2e0be,,,

Here, we study a complementary approach proposed by Rice and Spiegelhalter (2008) that uses as primary quantities the null model and a parametric family for the local false discovery rate. Specifically, we consider the half-normal decay and the beta-uniform mixture models as FDR threshold functions. Using simulations and analysis of real data we compare the performance of the Rice-Spiegelhalter approach with that of competing FDR estimation procedures. If the alternative model is misspecified and an empirical null distribution is employed the accuracy of FDR estimation degrades substantially. Hence, while being a very elegant formalism, the FDR threshold approach requires special care in actual application.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bernd Klaus"", ids = ""46967339""); list(name = ""Korbinian Strimmer"", ids = ""2633298"")",b4f9858e0c3239eedc2461af96d935cc5b501eb1,c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 3430c978d3484cc18a115205dc4382920f3defb9; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 9a39e80d9bae8fb7b6b087c32e8357e2b9f101b7; 5043fd247ee67d229bfb656264d634abc44518f7; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 59ac99583c8c5ec9de91932ce2397baf81e84f4d,,152,39-50

The quality of the models, however, has often only been empirically evaluated; the available theoretical results typically guarantee asymptotic correctness (consistency) of the algorithms. This paper describes theoretical bounds on the quality of a fundamental Bayesian Network local-learning task in the finite sample using theories for controlling the False Discovery Rate. The behavior of the derived bounds is investigated across various problem and algorithm parameters. Empirical results support the theory which has immediate ramifications in the design of new algorithms for Bayesian Network learning, variable selection and causal discovery.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ioannis Tsamardinos"", ids = ""3032369""); list(name = ""Laura E.

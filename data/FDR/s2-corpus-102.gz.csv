049d10c02ae49d485923a29e824108fe6529b4be,Identifying Genomic Regulators of Set-Wise Co-Expression,"The genetical genomics approach has been used to study the genetic basis of variation in gene expression, where putative transcriptional regulators of genes are identified via genetic quantitative trait mapping. The genetic regulators identified through such efforts can partially account for an individual gene's natural variation. However, genes in a molecular pathway often exhibit coordinated activities, the patterns and levels of which are also regulated. In an effort to understand these complicated mechanisms, we propose a method that searches for the genomic regulators of set-wise co-expression of related genes, based on current genetical genomics data. Using this method, we studied genomic regulators of 233 biological pathways for a BXD RI data set. For 15 pathways, we obtained significant regulatory loci after controlling for the false discovery rate. The results presented in this paper constitute important evidence of the heritability of mRNA co-expression between individuals. We have shown that, by defining new phenotypes using existing genetical genomics data, evidence on regulation of co-expression can be derived.",2007,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jung Hoon Woo"", ids = ""2832346""); list(name = ""Tian Zheng"", ids = ""145857621""); list(name = ""Ju Han Kim"", ids = ""46454310"")",,da0708923ea733f7b1fb25aa8971df37080d986f; 11cdd5e9e05c05e59249c9dfc2c9bf6264604ed4; 64af617824b16a3424f9674e3950c288d997ff21; 64e54ac10b2c1eb53256df228b84eda7f8ddd391; ebea418b4a95d32c7d240fdccde466585ab17841; 2459b8e56f02c9d9c3b19ae8fcd75fedf05391d5; 5a0e2419b95192e883babcd7a349d82ac99a546d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 1ae155fbd0c4614d9f9dd9b3b57ac4d3aad7bdc6; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; b3e1705716a12a2cea281dbd4bab6aa13b6d8b87; 93979ac5135302134476a4b6b7c8c32ea01b5a3d; 8bf6c7eef879565d2416a730e26c24536bf25a34; 53adfe99b4cc9c2a1a115de2832d9ead672ab94d; 84427158012a6d165e7fd80e0aa79e7228ef52fb; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 07d1536b8df0e4fa18856d7241f493ca21061099,2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering,,433-439
6134b7e5cc07bd72e89c773885e9f3081c01f086,The gut microbiome composition associates with bipolar disorder and illness severity.,"The gut microbiome is emerging as an important factor in regulating mental health yet it remains unclear what the target should be for psychiatric treatment. We aimed to elucidate the complement of the gut-microbiome community for individuals with bipolar disorder relative to controls; and test for relationships with burden of disease measures. We compared the stool microbiome from individuals with bipolar disorder (nÂ =Â 115) and control subjects (nÂ =Â 64) using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence analysis. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed global community case-control differences (AMOVA pÂ =Â 0.047). Operational Taxonomical Unit (OTU) level analysis revealed significantly decreased fractional representation (pÂ <Â 0.001) of Faecalibacterium after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and false discovery rate (FDR) correction at the pÂ <Â 0.05 level. Within individuals with bipolar disorder, the fractional representation of Faecalibacterium associated with better self-reported health outcomes based on the Short Form Health Survey (SF12); the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9); the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD7); and the Altman Mania Rating Scale (ASRM), independent of covariates. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the gut microbiome relationships with multiple psychiatric domains from a bipolar population. The data support the hypothesis that targeting the microbiome may be an effective treatment paradigm for bipolar disorder.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Simon J Evans"", ids = ""50480380""); list(name = ""Christine M Bassis"", ids = ""6852454""); list(name = ""Robert J.

ebe00541c72591a20d072e9ea744e02495f9a45a,Analysis of the transcriptome : investigation of human embryonic stem cells during directed differentiation to cardiovascular lineages,"To date, the need for effective treatments to tackle ischaemic diseases such as CHD and PAD remains unmet. As such, there has been a great deal of interest in developing cell therapies in order to address these important pathologies. The main goals of a cell therapy strategy for ischaemic disease remain prompt restoration of blood supply to the affected areas in order to salvage tissue and/or regeneration of tissues previously lost to ischaemia. 
Derived from the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) of an embryo at the blastocyst stage, hESC have been proposed as a potential source of functional, transplantable cells for a variety of cell therapy applications. Although successful differentiation of multiple cell types from hESC has been demonstrated, the molecular processes governing the cell commitment process remain poorly understood, and differentiation efficiency often fails to provide the number of cells required to see clinical benefit in the patient. As such, a more thorough transcriptional characterisation of cardiovascular cell types derived from hESC was the goal of this study. 
MicroRNAs (miRNA; miR) are small (~22nt), non-coding RNAs which negatively regulate mRNA. MiR-1 and miR-133 were previously shown to play a role in regulating cardiac differentiation with miR-1 potentiating cardiac differentiation and miR-133 having an inhibitory effect. Optimisation of lentiviral vectors showed generation of single pre-miR overexpression lentiviruses for miR-1 and miR-133 in a construct using the SFFV promoter to be possible. Furthermore, it was realised SA461 hESC were unsuitable for cardiac differentiation, however, using a modified version of the LaFlamme protocol in a monolayer system resulted in beating cells with a cardiomyocyte phenotype in H1 hESC. Despite successful overexpression of miR-1 and miR-133, there was very little effect on cardiac differentiation over no virus control. 
Previously published methods for the generation of vascular endothelial cells (EC) have reported varying efficiency and target cell population purity (~3 â€“ 30%). This laboratory recently reported the successful generation of functional EC-like cells from hESC in a feeder-free manner. HESC-EC were analysed by LC Sciences miRNA microarray at early time points day 0, day 2, day 4 and day 10 after initiation of differentiation with time-matched pluripotent controls. An induction of miR-99b, -181a and -181b over time was observed, and validated in H1 hESC. In addition, miR-99b, -181a and -181b were also found to be expressed in other mesodermal cell types including adult human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC). No statistically significant expression of these miRNAs could be found in representative cell types of ectoderm and endoderm germ layers, therefore it was hypothesised that these miRNAs were largely mesoderm specific. Despite initial data showing a significant difference in expression between HSVEC from control patients and patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), classical pathophysiological stimuli to cause endothelial cell stress did not change the expression of miR-99b, -181a and -181b in vitro. 
 In order to understand more about gene expression in early lineage commitment, hESC-EC were analysed by Illumina microarray at early timepoints day 0, day 2, day 4 and day 10 after initiation of differentiation with time-matched pluripotent controls. In parallel, primary human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) were analysed. Illumina technology permitted whole-genome profiling in a high throughput chip format. Due to overall expression levels being lower intensity than expected, no cut-off of fold-change was applied to the dataset. Analysis of the dataset showed a large number of significantly differentially expressed probes at each time point: Day 2 of endothelial differentiation compared to Day 0 pluripotent control showed 1040 significant differentially expressed probe changes, Day 4 of endothelial differentiation compared to Day 0 pluripotent control showed 2400 significant differentially expressed probe changes and Day 10 of endothelial differentiation compared to Day 0 pluripotent control showed 2157 significant differentially expressed probe changes (all False Discovery Rate <0.05). Although significant downregulation of pluripotency markers were observed, few endothelial associated genes were present at hESC-EC day 10. Analysis of HSVEC compared to hESC-EC Day 10 reveals 6133 significantly differentially expressed probes (FDR <0.05). This suggests that although day 10 hESC-ECs have previously been shown satisfy criteria for endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, their transcriptional profiling demonstrates that they remain different in comparison to adult ECs. 
A transient induction of several transcription factors was observed at hESC-EC day 2, accounting for some 10% of gene changes at this time point. We hypothesised that these transcription factors may play key roles in the early mesoderm/EC commitment process. Of these, FOXA2, a transcription factor not previously associated with mesoderm or EC commitment, was upregulated, and this was further validated by both qRT-PCR and ICC in SA461, H1 and RC10 hESC lines. In addition to gene expression data, an in silico prediction of gene epigenetic status was made using a previously published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-SEQ) dataset performed in H9 hESC. Approximately 3000 genes are bivalently marked, meaning they have both H3K4me3 active chromatin and H3K27me3 repressive chromatin at their transcriptional start sites (TSS). This conveys a poised state, with the potential for the gene to be rapidly activated and/or repressed. Of these bivalent genes it was noted that FOXA2 was marked as being potentially bivalent. Upon further investigation using ChIP it was revealed that FOXA2 carried both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 chromatin modifications in the TSS region, both in H9 and SA461 pluripotent hESC. It was hypothesised that epigenetic modification was responsible for the dynamic expression of FOXA2, although this hypothesis remains to be investigated further. Lastly, several of the miRNA targets for miR-99b, miR-181a and miR-181b were downregulated by hESC-EC day 10 compared to hESC-EC day 0, although whether these targets play a role in refining differentiation to EC warrants further investigation. 
In summary, a range of molecular biology techniques were employed to investigate the master control of hESC differentiation. These studies have contributed to existing knowledge on mesodermal and cardiovascular lineage specification. They provide evidence to support the continued in depth investigation of these processes in order to develop a clinically relevant cell therapy for ischaemic diseases.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Lynsey Howard"", ids = ""40085857"")",,349bc6622b0d50dd7e035b545dc72d2fcaacb5c7;

Recent studies from our laboratory have reported that bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from PMF patients (PMF-MSCs) showed a transcriptome and functional profile in agreement with an imprinted alteration of their osteogenic potential 1&2 . We performed advanced in silico analysis of accessible chromatin landscape of proliferative hFOB cells (human Fetal OsteoBlastic cell line) and identified 1183 target promoters during early phase of osteoblastic differentiation. Integration of these osteoblastic promoters in the transcriptome of PMF versus healthy donors (HD) BM-MSCs 2 revealed an overexpression of 222 genes in the mesenchymal transcriptional program of patients (False discovery rate: FDR We also showed that a majority of transcription factors link to osteoblastic differentiation such as JUN, NFATC1, SP7, DLX5, FOS, RUNX2 were down regulated in PMF-MSC transcriptome (GSEA NES=-2.79, p-value vs. differentiation transcription program in these cells. Erk1/Erk2 was found to be hyperphosphorylated in PMF-MSCs by flow cytometry. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PD98059 during the early phase of in vitro MSC osteoblastic differentiation reveals an increase expression of collagen, a marker of differentiation, as shown by confocal microscopy. This is less the case with myc-inhibitor I (Calbiochem), suggesting the participation of the MAPK pathway in the proliferative vs. differentiation balance of MSCs/osteoprogenitors. In conclusion, integration of the open chromatin genomic landscape of the hFOB osteoblast fetal cells in the PMF BM-MSC transcriptome reveals a proliferative program of MSCs/osteoprogenitors associated in vitro with a repression of the differentiation in accordance with an increase proliferative osteoprogenitor priming of PMF-MSCs 1 and with the presence of large size osteoblastic cells in vicinity of the neo-ossification area observed in the BM of PMF patients with osteomyelosclerosis.

b28c893d2adf9df307b36efbbc4014fc53af9988,Evaluating Ortholog Prediction Algorithms in a Yeast Model Clade,"BACKGROUND
Accurate identification of orthologs is crucial for evolutionary studies and for functional annotation. Several algorithms have been developed for ortholog delineation, but so far, manually curated genome-scale biological databases of orthologous genes for algorithm evaluation have been lacking. We evaluated four popular ortholog prediction algorithms (MultiParanoid; and OrthoMCL; RBH: Reciprocal Best Hit; RSD: Reciprocal Smallest Distance; the last two extended into clustering algorithms cRBH and cRSD, respectively, so that they can predict orthologs across multiple taxa) against a set of 2,723 groups of high-quality curated orthologs from 6 Saccharomycete yeasts in the Yeast Gene Order Browser.


RESULTS
Examination of sensitivity [TP/(TP+FN)], specificity [TN/(TN+FP)], and accuracy [(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)] across a broad parameter range showed that cRBH was the most accurate and specific algorithm, whereas OrthoMCL was the most sensitive. Evaluation of the algorithms across a varying number of species showed that cRBH had the highest accuracy and lowest false discovery rate [FP/(FP+TP)], followed by cRSD. Of the six species in our set, three descended from an ancestor that underwent whole genome duplication. Subsequent differential duplicate loss events in the three descendants resulted in distinct classes of gene loss patterns, including cases where the genes retained in the three descendants are paralogs, constituting 'traps' for ortholog prediction algorithms. We found that the false discovery rate of all algorithms dramatically increased in these traps.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that simple algorithms, like cRBH, may be better ortholog predictors than more complex ones (e.g., OrthoMCL and MultiParanoid) for evolutionary and functional genomics studies where the objective is the accurate inference of single-copy orthologs (e.g., molecular phylogenetics), but that all algorithms fail to accurately predict orthologs when paralogy is rampant.",2011,Biology;

Aberrant promoter DNA methylation can serve as a predictive biomarker for improved clinical responses to certain chemotherapeutics. One of the major advantages of methylation biomarkers is the ease of detection and clinical application. In order to identify methylation biomarkers predictive of a response to a taxane-platinum based chemotherapy regimen in advanced NSCLC we performed an unbiased methylation analysis of 1,536 CpG dinucleotides in cancer-associated gene loci and correlated results with clinical outcomes.


METHODS
We studied a cohort of 49 patients (median age 62 years) with advanced NSCLC treated at the Atlanta VAMC between 1999 and 2010. Methylation analysis was done on the Illumina GoldenGate Cancer panel 1 methylation microarray platform. Methylation data were correlated with clinical response and adjusted for false discovery rates.


RESULTS
Cav1 methylation emerged as a powerful predictor for achieving disease stabilization following platinum taxane based chemotherapy (pâ€Š=â€Š1.21E-05, FDR significance â€Š=â€Š0.018176). In Cox regression analysis after multivariate adjustment for age, performance status, gender, histology and the use of bevacizumab, CAV1 methylation was significantly associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.18 (95%CI: 0.03-0.94)). Silencing of CAV1 expression in lung cancer cell lines(A549, EKVX)by shRNA led to alterations in taxane retention.


CONCLUSIONS
CAV1 methylation is a predictor of disease stabilization and improved overall survival following chemotherapy with a taxane-platinum combination regimen in advanced NSCLC. CAV1 methylation may predict improved outcomes for other chemotherapeutic agents which are subject to cellular clearance mediated by caveolae.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Seth A Brodie"", ids = ""4276039""); list(name = ""Courtney M.

In 11 patients with ICH, peripheral blood was collected within 24â€‰h of symptom onset or last known well, and a second blood draw occurred 72â€‰h (Â±6) after the first. RNA-seq identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the first and second samples. Biological pathway enrichment analysis was performed with IngenuityÂ® Pathway Analysis (IPA). A total of 16,640 genes were identified and 218 were significant DEGs after ICH (false discovery rate <0.1). IPA identified 97 disease and functional categories that were significantly upregulated (z-score >2) post-ICH; 46 categories were specifically related to immune cell activation, 22 to general cellular activation processes, and 4 to other inflammation-related responses. In the canonical pathway and network analysis, inflammatory mediators of particular importance included interleukin-8, NF-ÎºB, ERK1/2, and members of the integrin class. ICH induced peripheral blood gene expression at 72 to 96â€‰h compared with 0 to 24â€‰h from symptom onset. DEGs that were highly expressed included those related to inflammation and activation of the immune response.

042b7178cadafe8655ac5137284d29a48a43cc48,Impact of acute exposure to cigarette smoke on airway gene expression.,"BACKGROUND
Understanding effects of acute smoke exposure (ASE) on airway epithelial gene expression and their relationship with the effects of chronic smoke exposure may provide biological insights into the development of smoking-related respiratory diseases.


METHODS
Bronchial airway epithelial cell brushings were collected from 63 individuals without recent cigarette smoke exposure and before and 24 h after smoking three cigarettes. RNA from these samples was profiled on Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarrays.


RESULTS
We identified 91 genes differentially expressed 24 h after ASE (false discovery rate < 0.25). ASE induced genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation and repressed genes related to cilium morphogenesis and cell cycle. While many genes altered by ASE are altered similarly in chronic smokers, metallothionein genes are induced by ASE and suppressed in chronic smokers. Metallothioneins are also suppressed in current and former smokers with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
Acute exposure to as little as three cigarettes and chronic smoking induce largely concordant changes in airway epithelial gene expression. Differences in short-term and long-term effects of smoking on metallothionein expression and their relationship to lung cancer requires further study given these enzymes' role in the oxidative stress response.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""E Billatos"", ids = ""49500503""); list(name = ""Alen Faiz"", ids = ""6922979""); list(name = ""Yaron Gesthalter"", ids = ""49919329""); list(name = ""Antoine Leclerc"", ids = ""48479991""); list(name = ""Yuriy O.

ac5ab343ddb14c98f7fd0e1a96985f674de366cc,Application of Metabolic Profiling to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Research.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex disease posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Metabonomics may aid in the diagnosis of AAA, determination of individualized risk, discovery of therapeutic targets, and improve understanding of pathogenesis. A systematic review of the diversity and outcomes of existing AAA metabonomic research has been performed. Original research studies applying metabonomics to human aneurysmal disease are included. Seven relevant articles were identified: four studies were based on plasma/serum metabolite profiling, and three studies examined aneurysmal tissue. Aminomalonic acid, guanidinosuccinic acid, and glycerol emerge as potential plasma biomarkers of large aneurysm. Lipid profiling improves predictive models of aneurysm presence. Patterns of metabolite variation associated with AAA relate to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Perioperative perturbations in metabolites suggest differential systemic inflammatory responses to surgery, generating hypotheses for adjunctive perioperative therapy. Significant limitations include small study sizes, lack of correction for multiple testing false discovery rates, and single time-point sampling. Metabolic profiling carries the potential to identify biomarkers of AAA and elucidate pathways underlying aneurysmal disease. Statistically and methodologically robust studies are required for validation, addressing the hiatus in understanding mechanisms of aneurysm growth and developing effective treatment strategies.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mahim I Qureshi"", ids = ""7288029""); list(name = ""Michele Greco"", ids = ""35793722""); list(name = ""Panagiotis A.

acbb4d1dc2727e1b5653d51c4f541636e9d876a2,Genome-wide association studies for yield component traits in a macadamia breeding population,"Breeding for new macadamia cultivars with high nut yield is expensive in terms of time, labour and cost. Most trees set nuts after four to five years, and candidate varieties for breeding are evaluated for at least eight years for various traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are promising methods to reduce evaluation and selection cycles by identifying genetic markers linked with key traits, potentially enabling early selection through marker-assisted selection. This study used 295 progeny from 32 full-sib families and 29 parents (18 phenotyped) which were planted across four sites, with each tree genotyped for 4113 SNPs. ASReml-R was used to perform association analyses with linear mixed models including a genomic relationship matrix to account for population structure. Traits investigated were: nut weight (NW), kernel weight (KW), kernel recovery (KR), percentage of whole kernels (WK), tree trunk circumference (TC), percentage of racemes that survived from flowering through to nut set, and number of nuts per raceme. Seven SNPs were significantly associated with NW (at a genome-wide false discovery rate of <â€‰0.05), and four with WK. Multiple regression, as well as mapping of markers to genome assembly scaffolds suggested that some SNPs were detecting the same QTL. There were 44 significant SNPs identified for TC although multiple regression suggested detection of 16 separate QTLs. These findings have important implications for macadamia breeding, and highlight the difficulties of heterozygous populations with rapid LD decay. By coupling validated marker-trait associations detected through GWAS with MAS, genetic gain could be increased by reducing the selection time for economically important nut characteristics. Genomic selection may be a more appropriate method to predict complex traits like tree size and yield.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katie Oâ\200\231Connor"", ids = ""1521184774""); list(name = ""Ben Hayes"", ids = ""2135160""); list(name = ""Craig M Hardner"", ids = ""48759582""); list(name = ""Catherine J.

a74bd28cd0d9e71352d052f83353deaea619d217,Discovery of Noncancer Drug Effects on Survival in Electronic Health Records of Patients With Cancer: A New Paradigm for Drug Repurposing,"PURPOSE
Drug development is becoming increasingly expensive and time consuming. Drug repurposing is one potential solution to accelerate drug discovery. However, limited research exists on the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for drug repurposing, and most published studies have been conducted in a hypothesis-driven manner that requires a predefined hypothesis about drugs and new indications. Whether EHRs can be used to detect drug repurposing signals is not clear. We want to demonstrate the feasibility of mining large, longitudinal EHRs for drug repurposing by detecting candidate noncancer drugs that can potentially be used for the treatment of cancer.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
By linking cancer registry data to EHRs, we identified 43,310 patients with cancer treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and 98,366 treated at the Mayo Clinic. We assessed the effect of 146 noncancer drugs on cancer survival using VUMC EHR data and sought to replicate significant associations (false discovery rate < .1) using the identical approach with Mayo Clinic EHR data. To evaluate replicated signals further, we reviewed the biomedical literature and clinical trials on cancers for corroborating evidence.


RESULTS
We identified 22 drugs from six drug classes (statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Î²-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and Î±-1 blockers) associated with improved overall cancer survival (false discovery rate < .1) from VUMC; nine of the 22 drug associations were replicated at the Mayo Clinic. Literature and cancer clinical trial evaluations also showed very strong evidence to support the repurposing signals from EHRs.


CONCLUSION
Mining of EHRs for drug exposure-mediated survival signals is feasible and identifies potential candidates for antineoplastic repurposing.

The puzzle lies in the fact that for multiple testing, under the false discovery rate paradigm, such a monotonic relationship may not hold. In particular, exact false discovery rate control may lead to a less powerful testing procedure if a test statistic fails to fulfil the monotone likelihood ratio condition.

0221cbd404095e36b1e4e315dea6674b93a1c1f5,Association between common alcohol dehydrogenase gene (ADH) variants and schizophrenia and autism,"Humans express at least seven alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isoforms that are encoded by ADH gene cluster (ADH7â€“ADH1Câ€“ADH1Bâ€“ADH1Aâ€“ADH6â€“ADH4â€“ADH5) at chromosome 4. ADHs are key catabolic enzymes for retinol and ethanol. The functional ADH variants (mostly rare) have been implicated in alcoholism risk. In addition to catalyzing the oxidation of retinol and ethanol, ADHs may be involved in the metabolic pathways of several neurotransmitters that are implicated in the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, we comprehensively examined the associations between common ADH variants [minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.05] and 11 neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. A total of 50,063 subjects in 25 independent cohorts were analyzed. The entire ADH gene cluster was imputed across these 25 cohorts using the same reference panels. Association analyses were conducted, adjusting for multiple comparisons. We found 28 and 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively, that were significantly associated with schizophrenia in African-Americans and autism in European-Americans after correction by false discovery rate (FDR) (qÂ <Â 0.05); and 19 and 6 SNPs, respectively, that were significantly associated with these two disorders after region-wide correction by SNPSpD (8.9Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’5Â â‰¤Â pÂ Â â‰¤Â 0.0003 and 2.4Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’5Â â‰¤Â pÂ â‰¤Â 0.0003, respectively). No variants were significantly associated with the other nine neuropsychiatric disorders, including alcohol dependence.

Prenatal exposure to air pollution has been associated with childhood respiratory disease and other adverse outcomes. Epigenetics is a suggested link between exposures and health outcomes.


OBJECTIVES
We aimed to investigate associations between prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) with diameter [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) or [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and DNA methylation in newborns and children.


METHODS
We meta-analyzed associations between exposure to [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) at maternal home addresses during pregnancy and newborn DNA methylation assessed by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip in nine European and American studies, with replication in 688 independent newborns and look-up analyses in 2,118 older children. We used two approaches, one focusing on single cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and another on differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We also related PM exposures to blood mRNA expression.


RESULTS
Six CpGs were significantly associated [false discovery rate (FDR) [Formula: see text]] with prenatal [Formula: see text] and 14 with [Formula: see text] exposure. Two of the [Formula: see text] CpGs mapped to FAM13A (cg00905156) and NOTCH4 (cg06849931) previously associated with lung function and asthma. Although these associations did not replicate in the smaller newborn sample, both CpGs were significant ([Formula: see text]) in 7- to 9-y-olds. For cg06849931, however, the direction of the association was inconsistent. Concurrent [Formula: see text] exposure was associated with a significantly higher NOTCH4 expression at age 16 y. We also identified several DMRs associated with either prenatal [Formula: see text] and or [Formula: see text] exposure, of which two [Formula: see text] DMRs, including H19 and MARCH11, replicated in newborns.


CONCLUSIONS
Several differentially methylated CpGs and DMRs associated with prenatal PM exposure were identified in newborns, with annotation to genes previously implicated in lung-related outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4522.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Olena Gruzieva"", ids = ""6564665""); list(name = ""Cheng-Jian Xu"", ids = ""2673463""); list(name = ""Paul Darius Yousefi"", ids = ""4801217""); list(name = ""Caroline L Relton"", ids = ""145486772""); list(name = ""Simon Kebede Merid"", ids = ""2117432""); list(name = ""Carrie V.

Among 113 children with newly diagnosed ALL, lymphoblasts with the TEL-AML1 translocation had significantly lower DNPS than all other genetic subtypes of B-lineage ALL or T-lineage ALL (352 +/- 57 versus 1001 +/- 31 or versus 1315 +/- 76 fmol/nmol/h, P <.0001). By assessing the expression of 82 genes involved in purine metabolism (KEGG pathway database) in ALL blasts from 38 patients with B-lineage ALL (14 with TEL-AML1, 24 without), we identified 16 genes that were differentially expressed in TEL-AML1-positive and TEL-AML1-negative ALL (P <.001, false discovery rate [FDR] = 5%). The pattern of expression of these 16 genes discriminated TEL-AML1-positive ALL with a true accuracy of 84% in an independent test set (n = 17, confidence interval 70% to 94%, P <.001). Western blots of selected genes documented corresponding levels of the proteins encoded. Differentially expressed genes included HPRT, IMPDH, PAICS, and GART, all of which were expressed at a significantly lower level in TEL-AML1 ALL. These findings have established that TEL-AML1 ALL has significantly lower de novo purine synthesis and differential expression of genes involved in purine metabolism.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gianluigi Zaza"", ids = ""3986801""); list(name = ""Wenjian Yang"", ids = ""2595319""); list(name = ""Leo Kager"", ids = ""47591836""); list(name = ""Meyling H Cheok"", ids = ""144966564""); list(name = ""James P.

Analysis of data arising from such studies can be complicated by issues such as multiple comparison or lack of clarity about the goals of analysis. In this chapter, we provide an overview of key considerations in the analysis of such data sets, as well as a review of modern statistical techniques that have been used in the analysis of epigenetic data. We distinguish between exploratory studies and confirmation studies, providing guidance on statistical analysis in each case. In particular, we indicate when the control of familywise error rate or of false discovery rate is to be preferred. We provide an overview of unsupervised and supervised multivariate analysis, guidance on the analysis of microarray data, as well as guidance on study design considerations.",2012,Computer Science,"list(name = ""E.

Smad2/3 pathway inhibition using RAP-536 (murine version of ACE-536/luspatercept), a modified activin receptor type IIB ligand trap, decreased ineffective erythropoiesis (IE) and alleviated disease pathology in a murine model of Î²-thalassemia. In this study, we investigated the a) potential role of different Smad2/3 ligands that bind to luspatercept in the regulation of erythropoiesis and b) molecular mechanism of RAP-536 therapy in the murine model of Î²-thalassemia. Wild-type (WT) mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against activin B, GDF8 or GDF8/11 (10mg/kg, s.c, twice weekly for 2- weeks, N=5/group) either as a single agent or in combination, and compared with RAP-536 (10 mg/kg, s.c) treatment. Î²-thalassemic mice ( Hbb th3/+ ) were administered a single bolus of vehicle (VEH) or RAP-536 (30 mg/kg, i.p) (N=2/group). At 16 hours following administration the splenic basophilic erythroblasts (CD71 + Ter119 + FSC high ) were sorted by flow cytometry and RNA was isolated and subjected to genome wide transcriptome profiling using RNA sequencing analysis. a) Surface plasmon analysis revealed that ACE-536 binds Smad2/3 signaling ligands GDF11 and GDF8 with high affinity and activin B with lower affinity. There was minimal binding detected with Activin A, TGFÎ²1 or TGFÎ²3 ligands. Wt mice treated with RAP-536 increased RBC (+19%, P b) Transcriptome analysis of Î²-thalassemic erythroblasts revealed a total of 74 genes that were differentially expressed (absolute fold change >1.5, false discovery rate adjusted P value These data provide a potential mechanistic role for luspatercept treatment in Î²-thalassemia, by transcriptionally upregulating genes that promote erythroid differentiation and processing of unpaired Î±-globins. By inhibiting SMAD2/3 signaling, luspatercept relieves the block of terminal erythroid maturation and decreases ineffective erythropoiesis in diseases such as Î²-thalassemia and MDS.

bee9858827c11c19755ec6b01750abbe5d095bb2,False Discovery Rate Control,The multiple-testing problem arises when attempting to control a combined measure of error while performing many statistical hypothesis tests simultaneously. Traditional approaches to error control in multiple testing have focused on maximizing power while demanding stringent guarantees â€“ such as there being no false discoveries with high probability. The false discovery rate (FDR) is an alternative error criterion representing the expected proportion of false discoveries among all rejected null hypotheses. Procedures that control this rate can get a principled bound on errors while increasing detection power over traditional multiple-testing methods. Active research on procedures to control the FDR and related criteria has led to a wide variety of methods with good theoretical and empirical properties.,2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Christopher R.

This paper presents a new panel unit root test using false discovery rate (FDR). After proposing the new model, this paper compares it with IPS and other models by some artificial data. It is concluded that the new model has similar power of test as compared with other tests.",2010,Engineering,"list(name = ""ê¹\200ìœ¤ëŒ\200"", ids = ""98068565""); list(name = ""ì „ì¹\230í\230\201"", ids = ""52094035"")",,,,,1462-1469

However, the complete effects of LPL hydrolysis products and its FFA component on macrophage gene expression and atherosclerosis are not fully understood. Hypothesis: The FFA liberated from lipoproteins by LPL affect gene expression in macrophages to potentially promote atherogenesis. Methods: Total lipoproteins from fasted normolipidemic subjects were hydrolyzed with human LPL to generate LPL hydrolysis products, which were incubated with human THP-1 macrophages at 0.68 mM (by FFA content). Gene expression was compared to macrophages incubated with a non-hydrolyzed control using microarrays. We further assessed the expression of select transcripts (as identified from microarrays) by incubating THP-1 cells with either the total FFA component of the hydrolysis products, or individual classes of FFA - all matching the concentrations of individual species of FFA within LPL hydrolysis products. Results: Our microarray data showed that LPL hydrolysis products upregulated 183 transcripts and downregulated 133 transcripts - (false discovery rate=0.03, n =3). Of the upregulated transcripts, 63 were small nucleolar RNAs. Gene ontology (GO) analyses suggest that the LPL hydrolysis product data is indicative of foam cell formation. Select transcripts identified from GO analyses associated with ribosome synthesis ( SNORA56/DKC1V3 ), cell cycle ( PCNA ), stress response ( ATF3 ), type I interferon signaling ( IFITM1 ), and lipid metabolism ( CD36 and PLIN2 ) were validated by qPCR ( p n =3). Analysis of the expression of these transcripts in the presence of either the total FFA component of the hydrolysis products, or individual classes of the FFA component, revealed mixed effects on the gene expression versus those observed for the LPL hydrolysis product treatment. Conclusions: LPL hydrolysis products appear to affect the expression of genes that favor foam cell formation, but it is likely that components other than the FFA differentially affect macrophage gene expression.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Narmadaa Thyagarajan"", ids = ""9038579""); list(name = ""Sherri L.

After the rose of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and human-machine interaction (HMI) concept, biomedical signals such as electroencephalograph (EEG) and electrooculograph (EOG) begun to be implemented in control and communication systems. EOG, the signal resulted from eye movement, has been used to design various applications from drowsiness detection to virtual keyboard control. The key of the system developed from EOG signal is the detection system for every eye movement. In this study, a sliding window technique is proposed to make eye movement patterns easier be formulated and using overlap window to avoid local extrema when computing the feature. Evaluation of this method shows that combination of 0.5 s-window length and 25% overlap give 17% and 1% false discovery rate (FDR) in vertical and horizontal channel while the true positive rate (TPR) in both channel is 98% The combination of automatic-window and 25% overlap give a better accuracy with 99% and 100% TPR in the two direction while the FDRs are 22% and 1%.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Catur Atmaji"", ids = ""9748886""); list(name = ""Agfianto Eko Putra"", ids = ""1921766""); list(name = ""Arrijal Hanif"", ids = ""41021680"")",,,2018 International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT),,628-632
bc09ae919fa4ed6bd107a9d4c169b1f6def2de22,Gene expression profiling of resistant and susceptible soybean lines infected with soybean cyst nematode,"Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is the most devastating pathogen of soybean. Information about the molecular basis of soybeanâ€“SCN interactions is needed to assist future development of effective management tools against this pathogen. Toward this end, soybean transcript abundance was measured using the Affymetrix Soybean Genome Array in a susceptible and a resistant reaction of soybean to SCN infection. Two genetically related soybean sister lines TN02-226 and TN02-275, which are resistant and susceptible, respectively, to the SCN race 2 infection were utilized in these experiments. Pairwise comparisons followed by false discovery rate analysis indicated that the expression levels of 162 transcripts changed significantly in the resistant line, of which 84 increased while 78 decreased. However, in the susceptible line, 1,694 transcripts changed significantly, of which 674 increased while 1,020 decreased. Comparative analyses of these transcripts indicated that a total of 51 transcripts were in common between resistance and susceptible responses. In this set, 42 transcripts increased in the resistant line, but decreased in the susceptible line. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the results of microarray analysis. Of the transcripts to which a function could be assigned, genes were associated with metabolism, cell wall modification, signal transduction, transcription, and defense. Microarray analyses examining two genetically related soybean lines against the same SCN population provided additional insights into the specific changes in gene expression of a susceptible and a resistant reaction beneficial for identification of genes involved in defense.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mitra Mazarei"", ids = ""2891701""); list(name = ""Wusheng Liu"", ids = ""6455303""); list(name = ""Hani Al-Ahmad"", ids = ""1422884080""); list(name = ""Prakash R.

7a63f7d63369a732b262b6b42b1cc7604c4d4d21,Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2Î± Mutation-Related Paragangliomas Classify as Discrete Pseudohypoxic Subcluster12,"Recently, activating mutations of the hypoxia-inducible factor 2Î± gene (HIF2A/EPAS1) have been recognized to predispose to multiple paragangliomas (PGLs) and duodenal somatostatinomas associated with polycythemia, and ocular abnormalities. Previously, mutations in the SDHA/B/C/D, SDHAF2, VHL, FH, PHD1, and PHD2 genes have been associated with HIF activation and the development of pseudohypoxic (cluster-1) PGLs. These tumors overlap in terms of tumor location, syndromic presentation, and noradrenergic phenotype to a certain extent. However, they also differ especially by clinical outcome and by presence of other tumors or abnormalities. In the present study, we aimed to establish additional molecular differences between HIF2A and non-HIF2A pseudohypoxic PGLs. RNA expression patterns of HIF2A PGLs (n=6) from 2 patients were compared with normal adrenal medullas (n=8) and other hereditary pseudohypoxic PGLs (VHL: n=13, SDHB: n=15, and SDHD: n=14). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that HIF2A PGLs made up a separate cluster from other pseudohypoxic PGLs. Significance analysis of microarray yielded 875 differentially expressed genes between HIF2A and other pseudohypoxic PGLs after normalization to adrenal medulla (false discovery rate 0.01). Prediction analysis of microarray allowed correct classification of all HIF2A samples based on as little as three genes (TRHDE, LRRC63, IGSF10; error rate: 0.02). Genes with the highest expression difference between normal medulla and HIF2A PGLs were selected for confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, HIF2A PGLs show a characteristic expression signature that separates them from non-HIF2A pseudohypoxic PGLs.

d38471313e12e9745f6f8c5550fdaee008a24acb,Repatriation is associated with isthmus cingulate cortex reduction in community-dwelling elderly.,"OBJECTIVES
The impact of stressful life events (SLEs) on brain anatomy is poorly understood, particularly its long-term neural consequences. We tested the hypothesis that a serious SLE (repatriation of French citizens living in Algeria in 1962) is associated with changes in brain regions previously implicated in psychopathology (hippocampus, amygdala, corpus callosum, prefrontal cortex, anterior, posterior and isthmus cingulate cortex (ICC)) in a large elderly population.


METHODS
Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to acquire anatomical scans from 82 subjects repatriated from Algeria and 339 subjects without this experience or any other trauma. We derived quantitative regional estimates of subcortical volume using FreeSurfer Software. The General Linear Model was used to test the association between repatriation and changes in brain volume adjusted for confounders (gender, age, education, total brain volume, traumatic brain injury, Mini Mental State Examination score at baseline, current and lifetime major depression and recent SLEs).


RESULTS
Repatriation to France was associated with reduced volume in a number of areas; however, only left and right ICC survived to false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSIONS
In the elderly a previous (approximately 40 years before) serious SLE could be associated with long-term volume reduction in the ICC, independently of psychopathology.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Raffaella Calati"", ids = ""2916151""); list(name = ""Jerome J.

2abfcd1da1b1cac529763f9dbf361922d09e1ada,Prediction of operon-like gene clusters in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome based on co-expression analysis of neighboring genes.,"Operon-like arrangements of genes occur in eukaryotes ranging from yeasts and filamentous fungi to nematodes, plants, and mammals. In plants, several examples of operon-like gene clusters involved in metabolic pathways have recently been characterized, e.g. the cyclic hydroxamic acid pathways in maize, the avenacin biosynthesis gene clusters in oat, the thalianol pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, and the diterpenoid momilactone cluster in rice. Such operon-like gene clusters are defined by their co-regulation or neighboring positions within immediate vicinity of chromosomal regions. A comprehensive analysis of the expression of neighboring genes therefore accounts a crucial step to reveal the complete set of operon-like gene clusters within a genome. Genome-wide prediction of operon-like gene clusters should contribute to functional annotation efforts and provide novel insight into evolutionary aspects acquiring certain biological functions as well. We predicted co-expressed gene clusters by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient of neighboring genes and randomly selected gene pairs, based on a statistical method that takes false discovery rate (FDR) into consideration for 1469 microarray gene expression datasets of A. thaliana. We estimated that A. thaliana contains 100 operon-like gene clusters in total. We predicted 34 statistically significant gene clusters consisting of 3 to 22 genes each, based on a stringent FDR threshold of 0.1. Functional relationships among genes in individual clusters were estimated by sequence similarity and functional annotation of genes. Duplicated gene pairs (determined based on BLAST with a cutoff of E<10(-5)) are included in 27 clusters. Five clusters are associated with metabolism, containing P450 genes restricted to the Brassica family and predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism. Operon-like clusters tend to include genes encoding bio-machinery associated with ribosomes, the ubiquitin/proteasome system, secondary metabolic pathways, lipid and fatty-acid metabolism, and the lipid transfer system.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""M.

2b0d2f01169e03630bf0e7bcc4732c2730d4306c,A transcriptomics-based biological framework for studying mechanisms of endocrine disruption in small fish species.,"This study sought to construct a transcriptomics-based framework of signal transduction pathways, transcriptional regulatory networks, and the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to facilitate formulation of specific, testable hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of endocrine disruption in fish. For the analyses involved, we used data from a total of more than 300 microarrays representing 58 conditions, which encompassed 4 tissue types from zebrafish of both genders exposed for 1 of 3 durations to 10 different test chemicals (17alpha-ethynyl estradiol, fadrozole, 17beta-trenbolone, fipronil, prochloraz, flutamide, muscimol, ketoconazole, trilostane, and vinclozolin). Differentially expressed genes were identified by one class t-tests for each condition, and those with false discovery rates of less than 40% and treatment/control ratios > or =1.3-fold were mapped to orthologous human, mouse, and rat pathways by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to look for overrepresentation of known biological pathways. To complement the analysis of known biological pathways, the genes regulated by approximately 1800 transcription factors were inferred using the ARACNE mutual information-based algorithm. The resulting gene sets for all transcriptional factors, along with a group of compiled HPG-axis genes and approximately 130 publicly available biological pathways, were analyzed for their responses to the 58 treatment conditions by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and its variant, Extended-GSEA. The biological pathways and transcription factors associated with multiple distinct treatments showed substantial interactions among the HPG-axis, TGF-beta, p53, and several of their cross-talking partners. These candidate networks/pathways have a variety of profound impacts on such cellular functions as stress response, cell cycle, and apoptosis.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rong-lin Wang"", ids = ""4897082""); list(name = ""David C.

1427209baed7f724e5542dbdd6e0ffd9dd39d550,Increased connectivity of pain matrix in chronic migraine: a resting-state functional MRI study,"ObjectiveTo investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity in patients with chronic migraine (CM) using a data-driven method.MethodsWe prospectively recruited patients with either episodic migraine (EM) or CM aged 18â€“60â€‰years who visited the headache clinic of the Samsung Medical Center from July 2016 to December 2017. All patients underwent 3â€‰T MRI using an identical scanner. Patients were considered interictal if they did not have a migraine headache at the day andâ€‰Â±â€‰1â€‰days of functional MRI acquisition. Using the group-independent component analysis (ICA), connectivity analysis with a weighted and undirected network model was performed. The between-group differences in degree centrality (DC) values were assessed using 5000 permutation tests corrected with false discovery rate (FDR).ResultsA total of 62 patients (44 EM and 18 CM) were enrolled in this study. Among the seven functionally interpretable spatially independent components (ICs) identified, only one IC, interpreted as the pain matrix, showed a significant between-group difference in DC (CMâ€‰>â€‰EM, pâ€‰=â€‰0.046). This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, migraine with aura (MWA), allodynia, depression, and anxiety (pâ€‰=â€‰0.038). The pain matrix was functionally correlated with the hypothalamus (pâ€‰=â€‰0.040, EMâ€‰>â€‰CM) and dorsal raphe nucleus (pâ€‰=â€‰0.039, CMâ€‰>â€‰EM) with different levels of strength in EM and CM.ConclusionCM patients have a stronger connectivity in the pain matrix than do EM patients.

de8f34d8d24e1c8a432c81927bcf7b301804fa11,Inference on a large number of hypotheses based on limited samples,"Motivation: 
In genetischen Studien trifft man haufig auf zwei Probleme: Erstens versucht man Gene (oder Proteine) zu finden die zum Beispiel bei bestimmten Krankheiten im Vergleich zu gesunden Personen verschieden ausgepragt sind. Andererseits versucht man aus solchen Genen (Proteinen) prognostische Scores fur den klinischen Ausgang zum Beispiel einer Therapie eines Patienten zu finden. Schon in fruheren Publikationen wurde gezeigt, dass Zwei-Stufen Plane, wie das Pilot oder das Integrated Design geeignete Methoden sind um eine grose Anzahl von Hypothesen zu testen, wie es in solchen Studien der Fall ist. In genetischen Studien kann es vorkommen, dass die Kosten pro Beobachtung zwischen den beiden Stufen unterschiedlich sind, wenn zum Beispiel spezielle Chips fur die Untersuchung von selektierten Genen angefertigt werden mussen. In neueren Studien kommt es auch 
immer ofter vor, dass in der ersten Stufe ein billiges Standardverfahren und in der zweiten Stufe teureres, aber dafur genaueres Verfahren verwendet wird. Fur solche Zwei-Stufen Plane, in denen Kosten und Methoden zwischen den Stufen variieren, werden asymptotisch optimale Parameter untersucht. Es soll entweder die False Discovery Rate oder der Family Wise Error einhalten werden. 
Bezugnehmend auf das zweite angefuhrte Problem gibt es fur viele medizinische Untersuchungen in diesem Gebiet nur mangelhafte Erkenntnisse uber die statistischen Eigenshaften prognostischer Scores, die auf Basis von genetischen Datensatzen entwickelt werden. Solche statistische Eigenschaften, das heist wie gut ein Score, der aufgrund eines Trainigsdatensatzes erstellt wurde, den Ausgang einer Therapie eines zukunftigen Patienten vorhersagt, werden untersucht. Es wird dabei die ""area 
under the receiver operating characteristic"" (AUC) als Kriterium verwendet. 
Ergebnisse: 
Unterscheiden sich nur die Kosten pro Beobachtung zwischen den Stufen, zahlt sich auch bei einem beachtlichen Kostenverhaltnis zwischen den beiden Stufen die Anwendung von Zwei-Stufen Verfahren aus (im Sinne von hoherer Power). Die Power der optimalen Pilot und Integrated Designs ist zwar ahnlich hoch, das Integrated Design ist allerdings robuster gegen Fehleinschatzungen der Parameter in der Planungsphase. Im Allgemeinen fuhren Zwei-Stufen Plane, die die gleiche Methode in beiden Stufen verwenden, zu einer hoheren Power (in Abhangigkeit von Kosten- und Effektgrosenverhaltis), als Plane, bei denen die Methode in der zweiten Stufe geandert wird. Letztere Plane zahlen sich nur aus, wenn die teurere Methode aufgrund von fehlenden finanziellen Mitteln in der ersten Stufe nicht verwendet 
werden kann. 
Die Selektion von wirksamen Genen (Proteinen) und somit die Aufstellung von prognostischen Scores hangt sehr oft von den Trainigsdaten ab, bei denen die Stichprobengrose oft drastisch kleiner ist als die Anzahl der untersuchten Hypothesen, so dass die Asymptotik (Stichprobenumfang geht gegen unendlich) von Modellselektionsprozeduren nicht mehr 
stimmt. Diese Scores sind daher verzerrt und sehr variabel. Wenn tatsachlich mehrere effektive Marker existieren stellt es sich heraus, dass es besser ist liberalere Selektionskiterien zu verwenden und somit auch einige (oft sogar viele) ineffektive Marker in den Score mit aufzunehmen. Gilt allerdings die Globale Nullhypothese fuhren solche liberalen Kriterien dazu, dass Pseudo-Scores erstellt werden, die keinen prognostischen Wert haben. 
Das beste Selektionskriterium um einen prognostischen Score mit einer hohen AUC zu erzeugen ist allerdings von Parametern wie der Anzahl der insgesamt gestesteten Hypothesen, der Stichprobengrose oder dem Anteil der effektiven Marker abhangig. Wir testeten eine modifizierte Jackknife Methode um das optimal Selektionskriterium zu 
finden. Es stellt sich heraus, dass diese Methode ein geeignetes Selektionskriterium findet und zusatzlich Informationen uber die Anzahl der falsch-positiven Entscheidungen liefert. Daruber hinaus bekommt man durch kleine Jackknife-AUC Werte einen Hinweis darauf, dass man sich in einem spezifischen Datensatz in der ""Nahe"" der 
globale Nullhypothese befindet oder dass die Effekte fur den 
gegebenen Stichprobenumfang zu kein sind.",2008,Philosophy,"list(name = ""Alexandra Goll"", ids = ""2184217"")",465026b4a7f2fd192307cd543227eb04c9e957f3,21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; c220f44321afd04570697a25c97ac61cf983f360; b2b16a9bf487b00f80801ff57c7cbb96503a9e81; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 7b06771ee8f39e516056df3365cd1cb679b5041f; c70d1123b8d398481f124950784506fc96f8549c; e0149f4926373368a0d88f7fb57c5549500fd83a; 154bbeafb23144ca2374afdedd1a83786fff449f; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 3d157ead0da8d2ae9960b3b82dde17fb5a381afd; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; dfb57fad4249c7d5016e64a58e14b71bb51e2928; 1ca20a49a125b649c833975174f4e3f99ed0c76f; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 866e0a0a45027c4b0cdd6a8443e559b0a712fb2b; 857f7b6708def88ab493029c65907641a914c55e; bcd1db6c7ebf8ba6a0bbba14764d42a741a4160a; dec1ba636fe2c59afc45de95a2a8a305c5786924,,,
8278e664dd31ad4d8b12260a8190d56bff1b5e79,Prediction of Protein-protein Interactions and Essential Genes through Data Integration,"Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions and Essential Genes Through Data Integration Max Kotlyar Doctor of Philosophy Graduate Department of Department of Medical Biophysics University of Toronto 2011 The currently known network of human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is providing new insights into diseases and helping to identify potential therapies. However, according to several estimates, the known interaction network may represent only 10% of the entire interactome â€“ indicating that more comprehensive knowledge of the interactome could have a major impact on understanding and treating diseases. The primary aim of this thesis was to develop computational methods to provide increased coverage of the interactome. A secondary aim was to gain a better understanding of the link between networks and phenotype, by analyzing essential mouse genes. Two algorithms were developed to predict PPIs and provide increased coverage of the interactome: FpClass and mixed co-expression. FpClass differs from previous PPI prediction methods in two key ways: it integrates both positive and negative evidence for protein interactions, and it identifies synergies between predictive features. Through these approaches FpClass provides interaction networks with significantly improved reliability and interactome coverage. Compared to previous predicted human PPI networks, FpClass provides a network with over 10 times more interactions, about 2 times more proteins and a lower false discovery rate. This network includes 595 disease related proteins from OMIM and Cancer Gene Census which have no previously known interactions. The second method, mixed co-expression, aims to predict transient PPIs, which have proven",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Max Kotlyar"", ids = ""2586650"")",651b40be69a8e4c91fb260e9b3badcd65d3954ce; 943b85aa70ed4dcec0ee53edb23ed686d101fc30,1dc18baed79c3ae009d73d109a7aaec9f9195a2f;

6303f487cf9edb48df1c231bd266c124f97e6c5b,Modeling inter-signal arrival times for accurate detection of CAN bus signal injection attacks: a data-driven approach to in-vehicle intrusion detection,"Modern vehicles rely on hundreds of on-board electronic control units (ECUs) communicating over in-vehicle networks. As external interfaces to the car control networks (such as the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port, auxiliary media ports, etc.) become common, and vehicle-to-vehicle / vehicle-to-infrastructure technology is in the near future, the attack surface for vehicles grows, exposing control networks to potentially life-critical attacks. This paper addresses the need for securing the controller area network (CAN) bus by detecting anomalous traffic patterns via unusual refresh rates of certain commands. While previous works have identified signal frequency as an important feature for CAN bus intrusion detection, this paper provides the first such algorithm with experiments using three attacks in five (total) scenarios. Our data-driven anomaly detection algorithm requires only five seconds of training time (on normal data) and achieves true positive / false discovery rates of 0.9998/0.00298, respectively (micro-averaged across the five experimental tests).",2017,Engineering; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Michael R.

0ada23818c2bd116b231e567564255459fe5dc30,A Simple Method for Testing Global and Individual Hypotheses Involving a Limited Number of Possibly Correlated Outcomes,"Tests for the presence of a global treatment effect expressed by possibly correlated â€œprimaryâ€ outcome variables taken together frequently use Bonferroni-type adjustments. These procedures accommodate an arbitrary number of comparisons, but can be conservative if the outcome variables are highly correlated. This conservatism can be ameliorated by a simple rule requiring essentially no calculation (and therefore convenient to apply when exact calculation is impractical) that is relatively robust to the correlation structure of the responses when the number of comparisons is not large (16 or less for 5 % level tests). The recommended global testing rule is: For a type 1 error rate of Î± and up to K(Î±) â€œprimaryâ€ response variables, reject the global null hypothesis if (a) the smallest marginal p value is slightly less than Î± 1 = Î±/K, (b) the second smallest marginal p value is â‰¤ 2Î± 1, or (c) the third smallest marginal p value is â‰¤ Î±. Analytic expressions that do not assume independence or any particular distribution for the responses are provided for the probability of rejecting the global null hypothesis. The type 1 error rates and power generally are preserved regardless of the correlation structure. Individual comparisons can be tested if the global null hypothesis is rejected, with reasonable preservation of comparison-wise type 1 error rates and of the false discovery rates (FDRs).",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""A Lawrence Gould"", ids = ""144116033"")",,,,,519-546
a3a49c580a82cdb3190db0e210cffe87df25f67d,Gene expression in accumbens GABA neurons from inbred rats with different drug-taking behavior.,"Inbred Lewis and Fisher 344 rat strains differ greatly in drug self-administration; Lewis rats operantly self-administer drugs of abuse including nicotine, whereas Fisher self-administer poorly. As shown herein, operant food self-administration is similar. On the basis of their pivotal role in drug reward, we hypothesized that differences in basal gene expression in GABAergic neurons projecting from nucleus accumbens (NAcc) to ventral pallidum (VP) play a role in vulnerability to drug-taking behavior. The transcriptomes of NAcc shell-VP GABAergic neurons from these two strains were analyzed in adolescents, using a multidisciplinary approach that combined stereotaxic ionotophoretic brain microinjections, laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and microarray measurement of transcripts. Laser-capture microdissection enriched the gene transcripts detected in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons compared to the residual NAcc tissue: a ratio of neuron/residual >1 and false discovery rate (FDR) <5% yielded 6623 transcripts, whereas a ratio of >3 yielded 3514. Strain-dependent differences in gene expression within GABA neurons were identified; 322 vs. 60 transcripts showed 1.5-fold vs. 2-fold differences in expression (FDR < 5%). Classification by gene ontology showed that these 322 transcripts were widely distributed, without categorical enrichment. This is most consistent with a global change in GABA neuron function. Literature mining by Chilibot found 38 genes related to synaptic plasticity, signaling and gene transcription, all of which determine drug abuse; 33 genes have no known association with addiction or nicotine. In Lewis rats, upregulation of Mint-1, Cask, CamkII , Ncam1, Vsnl1, Hpcal1 and Car8 indicates that these transcripts likely contribute to altered signaling and synaptic function in NAcc GABA projection neurons to VP.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Burt M.

24f8d5cb3493143ed28cb89cf930872a807e1889,"A bioinformatic and computational approach to regulation of genome function: integrated analysis of genome organization, promoter sequences and gene expression.","Although much is known about gene expression regulation in both Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes, this complex and fascinating mechanism still remains to be fully elucidated. The relatively recent advent of high-throughput techniques for studying transcription has made available an invaluable amount of data that can be used for genome-wide analysis using bioinformatics approaches. These computational methods have now become an integrative part of biological research. The different topics of this thesis are related to the development and application of computational methodologies to better understand the basis of genomic gene expression regulation at different levels. A first level of investigation regarded the relationships among chromosomal structure, expression profile and functional characteristics, focusing on genomic organization and structure. For this task, REEF (REgionally Enriched Features) software has been developed, designed to identify genomic regions enriched in specific features, such as a class or group of genes homogeneous for expression and/or functional characteristics. REEF can be used to detect density variations of specific features along the genome sequence, for example genomic regions with significant enrichment of genes which are co-expressed, differentially expressed, or related to particular molecular functions. Local feature enrichment is calculated using test statistic based on the hypergeometric distribution applied genome-wide by sliding windows and false discovery rate is used for controlling multiplicity. REEF has been applied to the study of genomic distribution of tissue-specific genes and to the analysis of gene differentially expressed when comparing different myeloid cell lines. These analyses identified clusters of tissue-specific genes in the human genome and positional enrichment of hemopoietic functional module-related genes. The second level of investigation regarded gene expression regulation at promoter level. Unknown transcription factor binding sites might be detected by searching for shared sequence elements in upstream regulatory regions of genes with common biological function and/or similar expression profile. In fact, genes with similar expression are frequently co-regulated and genes with related function are often similarly expressed. New methodologies for the identification of regulatory motifs in human promoters were developed and tested. Since a drawback of this approach is the exceedingly high number of results, the use of biological knowledge both before and after application of automated pattern discovery allowed the definition of a â€œsheltered environmentâ€ enhancing the specificity of the computational analysis. COOP (Clustering of Overlapping Patterns) software for the extraction of sequence motifs was developed and used to analyze genomic sequences of 1 Kb upstream of 91 retina specific genes, identifying a set of putative regulative motifs, frequently occurring in retina promoter sequences. Most of them are localized in the proximal portion of promoters and tend to be less variable in central region than in lateral regions and some of them are similar to known regulatory sequences. The performances of COOP were further evaluated by simulation approaches and by applying it to a standard positive control dataset, proposed by Tompa and colleagues for systematic evaluation and comparison of pattern discovery software. A webtool for the prediction of functional elements in promoter sequences, MOST (MOtif Searching web Tool), has been applied to different datasets under various testing conditions in order to study the influence of specific search parameters on results. Two groups of promoter sequences containing known regulatory signals were used as positive control datasets: the public yeast benchmark dataset of Tompa and colleagues and a custom produced dataset of 37 human promoter sequences, subgroups of which contained some instances of one of nine different signals. The testing of performances of the method on different benchmark datasets gave quite positive results. 
Taking the concepts behind COOP to a new level, a more rigorous methodology was developed for the identification of surprising and putatively regulatory motifs, by comparing their frequency in promoters sequences of co-expressed genes with that in a background set of sequences, representative of the whole set of human gene promoters. Promoter sequences are divided in overlapping regions, considered independently, for identifying positional bias in the arrangement of transcription factors binding sites along promoters. Due to the genome-wide characteristics of this approach, a new webtool for the automatic identification and retrieval of a high number of promoters in the human genome was also developed. This motif discovery methodology has been adopted to investigate structure of promoters of genes crucial during myeloid differentiation.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Alessandro Coppe"", ids = ""51058023"")",,,,,
a6b9ba9b55185c5f471ee67eaaf58c779a6a4473,Novel learning framework (knockoff technique) to evaluate metric ranking algorithms to describe human response to injury.,"OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to present a novel framework, termed the knockoff technique, to evaluate different metric ranking algorithms to better describe human response to injury.


METHODS
Many biomechanical metrics are routinely obtained from impact tests using postmortem human surrogates (PMHS) to develop injury risk curves (IRCs). The IRCs form the basis to evaluate human safety in crashworthiness environments. The biomechanical metrics should be chosen based on some measure of their predictive ability. Commonly used algorithms for the choice of ranking the metrics include (a) areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), time-varying AUROC, and other adaptations, and (b) some variants of predictive squared error loss. This article develops a rigorous framework to evaluate the metric selection/ranking algorithms. Actual experimental data are used due to the shortcoming of using simulated data. The knockoff data are meshed into existing experimental data using advanced statistical algorithms. Error rate measures such as false discovery rates (FDRs) and bias are calculated using the knockoff technique. Experimental data are used from previously published whole-body PMHS side impact sled tests. The experiments were conducted at different velocities, padding and rigid load wall conditions, and offsets and with different supplemental restraint systems. The PMHS specimens were subjected to a single lateral impact loading resulting in injury and noninjury outcomes.


RESULTS
A total of 25 metrics were used from 42 tests. The AUROC-type algorithms tended to have higher FDRs compared to the squared error loss-type functions (45.3% for the best AUROC-type algorithms versus 31.4% for the best Brier score algorithm). Standard errors for the Brier score algorithm also tended to be lower, indicative of more stable metric choices and robust rankings. The wide variations observed in the performance of the algorithms demonstrated the need for data set-specific evaluation tools such as the knockoff technique developed in this study.


CONCLUSIONS
In the present data set, the AUROCs and related binary classification algorithms led to inflated FDRs, rendering metric selection/ranking questionable. This is particularly true for data sets with a high proportion of censoring. Squared error loss-type algorithms (such as the Brier score algorithm or its modifications) improved the performance in the metric selection process. The presented new knockoff technique may wholly change how IRCs are developed from impact experiments or simulations. At the very least, the knockoff technique demonstrates the need for evaluations among different metric ranking/selection algorithms, especially when they produce substantially different biomechanical metric choices. Without recommending the AUROC-type or Brier score-type algorithms universally, the authors suggest careful assessments of these algorithms using the proposed framework, so that a robust algorithm may be chosen, with respect to the nature of the experimental data set. Though results are given for sets from a published series of experiments, the knockoff technique is being used by the authors in tests that are applicable to the automotive, aviation, military, and other environments.",2018,Engineering; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anjishnu Banerjee"", ids = ""1784884""); list(name = ""Nicholas DeVogel"", ids = ""14104701""); list(name = ""Frank A.

69b1b366b0680442cf3dbd2a8b0828c468bf61f6,Prefrontal cortex activation is associated with a discrepancy between self- and observer-rated depression severities of major depressive disorder: a multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"BACKGROUND
Studies on major depressive disorder (MDD) show that the degree of correlation between the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) varies widely. We aimed to determine whether this discrepancy reflects specific functional abnormalities in the frontotemporal cortex.


METHODS
Mildly depressed or euthymic patients with MDD (n=52), including 21 patients with MDD with the discrepancy, i.e., those with low HAMD17 scores (â‰¤13) but high BDI-II scores (>28), and 31 patients without the discrepancy, i.e., those with low HAMD17 scores and low BDI-II scores (â‰¤28), participated in the study along with 48 control subjects. Regional changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) levels during a verbal fluency task (VFT) were monitored using a 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device.


RESULTS
In the frontotemporal regions, mean oxy-Hb changes induced by the VFT were significantly smaller in patients with MDD than in control subjects. In 5 channels within frontal regions, the increase in mean oxy-Hb levels was significantly greater in MDD patients with the BDI-HAMD discrepancy than in those without the discrepancy. In 6 channels within the frontal region of the patients with MDD, significant positive correlations were observed between mean oxy-Hb changes and BDI total scores (Ï=0.38-0.59; P<0.05, false discovery rate corrected).


LIMITATIONS
Our findings required replication in severely depressed patients, particularly those with melancholia.


CONCLUSIONS
The distinct pattern of activation of the prefrontal cortex suggests that MDD with the BDI-HAMD discrepancy is pathophysiologically different from MDD without the discrepancy.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hiroyuki Akashi"", ids = ""3695995""); list(name = ""Noa Tsujii"", ids = ""6922966""); list(name = ""Wakako Mikawa"", ids = ""3716987""); list(name = ""Toru Adachi"", ids = ""6252834""); list(name = ""Eiji Kirime"", ids = ""6848410""); list(name = ""Osamu Shirakawa"", ids = ""2261515"")",ea1d56595823b167e36f3f98a08b4228655b6611; 0c3ba01e449e63a5935f76916174a7a506fd5240; 20ba0a65c42343f729c7ca62b747627e9d3e0ac6; a677bc6aacb58b2d3b03aff065d99466feb323db; 029355a8ba7480703f352227c82fbc08008cb333; 4580444ca107af8a6dc9801a882284744e560fa3; 60a38e97cc42f1f7376091826e6d863973096066,,Journal of affective disorders,174,"

17d19d3f057831a5da643e8a552f070a6da223ef,Association of a polymorphism of BCHE with ischemic stroke in Japanese individuals with chronic kidney disease.,"Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for ischemic stroke, the genetic variants that confer susceptibility to ischemic stroke in individuals with CKD remain largely unknown. We performed an association study for candidate gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in individuals with CKD. The study population comprised 1041 Japanese individuals with CKD, including 228 subjects with ischemic stroke and 813 controls. The genotypes of 150 polymorphisms of 127 candidate genes were determined by a method that combines polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. An initial Ï‡2 test (false discovery rate <0.05) and subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates (P<0.05) revealed that the 1615Gâ†·A (Ala539Thr) polymorphism (rs1803274) of BCHE (OR=3.33; 95% CI 1.32-8.28) and the 2445Gâ†·A (Ala54Thr) polymorphism (rs1799883) of FABP2 (OR=1.66; 95% CI 1.01-2.70) were significantly associated with ischemic stroke.

22845c0bdf29ccbeb1d8e7c088e716e45a7f5bd4,Gene Expression Profiling of Bulk CD138+ Plasma Cells in Preneoplastic Gammopathy/Asymptomatic Myeloma Identifies Distinct Subsets of Patients.,"Gene expression profiling of plasma cells (GEP-PC) has provided major insights into myeloma pathobiology. However the data about GEP-PC in preneoplastic gammopathy (MGUS) or asymptomatic myeloma (AM) are limited, and gene expression patterns that might predict outcome in these patients have not been defined. We analyzed GEP (using U133Plus Affymetrix microarrays), of plasma cells isolated by immuno-magnetic bead selection with CD138 microbeads, from the bone marrow of patients with MGUS (n=16) and asymptomatic myeloma (AM; n=18) enrolled in a prospective South West Oncology Group (SWOG) observational study. Data from normal plasma cells (PCs) and from 105 myeloma PCs were included as controls. Myeloma PCs were randomly selected to include at least 15 patients from each of the 7 subgroups previously identified based on GEP of myeloma tumor cells (Zhan and Shaughnessy, ASH 2004). After the suppression of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, there were 1297 genes that significantly differed in expression between MGUS-PCs and MM-PCs, and 1099 genes that differed between MGUS-PCs and normal PCs with a 1% false discovery rate. Hierarchical cluster analysis of all samples was performed using 1000 plasma cell signature genes that were most differentially expressed between normal and myeloma PCs. These data demonstrated that both MGUS and AM samples were distributed between normal and MM samples. A prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) model (PNAS99:6567, 2002) utilizing 134 genes was then developed to determine if the signature from these genes in MGUS/AM was more similar to normal or to myeloma plasma cells. In this analysis, 11/16 (69%) of the MGUS samples were more similar to normal PC, compared to 6/18 (33%) of the AM samples (p=0.04). At present, there are no reliable phenotypic markers to distinguish between normal and malignant PCs within the bulk CD138+ population. Gene expression spikes for cyclin D1 and MAF/MAF-B were seen in both MGUS and AM cohorts, including in some patients with normal PC signature. These data provide the largest comparison to date, of GEP of PCs in preneoplastic versus malignant gammopathies and suggest that GEP may be a useful tool to prospectively identify subsets of patients within the MGUS/AM population with dominant normal PC or MM PC signatures, and potentially differing prognosis. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes between MGUS/MM PCs identified in this dataset may allow insights into the genomic changes in tumor cells underlying the malignant progression of myeloma.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Madhav V Dhodapkar"", ids = ""3630036""); list(name = ""Fenghuang Zhan"", ids = ""1784631""); list(name = ""Erik Rasmussen"", ids = ""145319803""); list(name = ""Bart Burington"", ids = ""46605342""); list(name = ""Brian G.

cf6cd0b43d03770e5628aed3ffc4d3c28094d12b,Vulnerabilities of transcriptome-wide association studies,"Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate GWAS and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) datasets to discover candidate causal gene-trait associations. We integrate multi-tissue expression panels and summary GWAS for LDL cholesterol and Crohnâ€™s disease to show that TWAS are highly vulnerable to discovering non-causal genes, because variants at a single GWAS hit locus are often eQTLs for multiple genes. TWAS exhibit acute instability when the tissue of the expression panel is changed: candidate causal genes that are TWAS hits in one tissue are usually no longer hits in another, due to lack of expression or strong eQTLs, while non-causal genes at the same loci remain. While TWAS is statistically valid when used as a weighted burden test to identify trait-associated loci, it is invalid to interpret TWAS associations as causal genes because the false discovery rate for TWAS causal gene discovery is not only high, but unquantifiable. More broadly, our results showcase limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Michael Wainberg"", ids = ""48874176""); list(name = ""Nasa Sinnott-Armstrong"", ids = ""1401233705""); list(name = ""David James Knowles"", ids = ""152681765""); list(name = ""David E.

cb3e1d57bd0d7c0690f3c445b76221ce6f46389e,FGF21 signalling pathway and metabolic traits â€“ genetic association analysis,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a novel master regulator of metabolic profile. The biological actions of FGF21 are elicited upon its klotho beta (KLB)-facilitated binding to FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1), FGFR2 and FGFR3. We hypothesised that common polymorphisms in the FGF21 signalling pathway may be associated with metabolic risk. At the screening stage, we examined associations between 63 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes of this pathway (FGF21, KLB, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3) and four metabolic phenotypes (LDL cholesterol â€“ LDL-C, HDL-cholesterol â€“ HDL-C, triglycerides and body mass index) in 629 individuals from Silesian Hypertension Study (SHS). Replication analyses were performed in 5478 unrelated individuals of the Swiss CoLaus cohort (imputed genotypes) and in 3030 directly genotyped individuals of the German Myocardial Infarction Family Study (GerMIFS). Of 54 SNPs that met quality control criteria after genotyping in SHS, 4 (rs4733946 and rs7012413 in FGFR1; rs2071616 in FGFR2 and rs7670903 in KLB) showed suggestive association with LDL-C (P=0.0006, P=0.0013, P=0.0055, P=0.011, respectively) and 1 (rs2608819 in KLB) was associated with body mass index (P=0.011); all with false discovery rate q<0.5. Of these, only one FGFR2 polymorphism (rs2071616) showed replicated association with LDL-C in both CoLaus (P=0.009) and men from GerMIFS (P=0.017). The direction of allelic effect of rs2071616 upon LDL-C was consistent in all examined populations.

8f3bcf880aeb2df6cdd797b0b02a38d44bd3d848,A Case Study on Choosing Normalization Methods and Test Statistics for Two-Channel Microarray Data,"DNA microarray analysis is a biological technology which permits the whole genome to be monitored simultaneously on a single slide. Microarray technology not only opens an exciting research area for biologists, but also provides significant new challenges to statisticians. Two very common questions in the analysis of microarray data are, first, should we normalize arrays to remove potential systematic biases, and if so, what normalization method should we use? Second, how should we then implement tests of statistical significance? Straightforward and uniform answers to these questions remain elusive. In this paper, we use a real data example to illustrate a practical approach to addressing these questions. Our data is taken from a DNA-protein binding microarray experiment aimed at furthering our understanding of transcription regulation mechanisms, one of the most important issues in biology. For the purpose of preprocessing data, we suggest looking at descriptive plots first to decide whether we need preliminary normalization and, if so, how this should be accomplished. For subsequent comparative inference, we recommend use of an empirical Bayes method (the B statistic), since it performs much better than traditional methods, such as the sample mean (M statistic) and Student's t statistic, and it is also relatively easy to compute and explain compared to the others. The false discovery rate (FDR) is used to evaluate the different methods, and our comparative results lend support to our above suggestions.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Xie"", ids = ""145668114""); list(name = ""Kyeong Soo Jeong"", ids = ""6483178""); list(name = ""Wei Pan"", ids = ""144282470""); list(name = ""Arkady B.

In particular, post-mortem brain studies support miRNA involvement in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders but their role as peripheral biomarkers or targets of pharmacological treatments has been scarcely investigated. 
Our purpose was to identify potential biological correlates of suicide and to evaluate their role in the pathogenesis and pharmacotherapy of suicide. We conducted a high-throughput profiling of miRNAs in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), not-treated or treated with lithium in vitro, derived from bipolar suicide completers (S, n=7) and non-suicidal bipolar patients (NS, n=12). Global miRNA expression was measured using nCounterÂ® miRNA expression Assay (NanoString Technologies). In total, 28 miRNAs were differentially expressed or regulated by lithium between the two groups at a false discovery rate of 0.1. Two miRNAs were validated with quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR): miR-4286, up-regulated in non-treated LCLs from S versus NS, and miR-186-5p, down-regulated in lithium-treated LCLs from S versus NS. Treatment of human neural progenitor cells with lithium down-regulated both miRNAs. Then, we evaluated the expression of these miRNAs in post-mortem brains from 12 suicidal bipolar subjects (Sbrain) and 13 healthy controls (Cbrain), showing an under-expression of miR-4286 in Sbrain and no differences for miR-186-5p. Finally, we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to clarify the possible role of the identified miRNAs in biological mechanisms involved in suicide. Results from GO analysis indicated that miR-4286 and miR-186-5p regulate the expression of key genes involved in neuronal processes as neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Whereas, KEGG pathway analysis showed that both miRNAs are involved in several biological pathways that could be related to suicide, such as TGF-beta signaling pathway and long-term potentiation pathway. 
In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-4286 and miR-186-5p could constitute potential biomarkers of suicide and be involved in the mechanism of action of lithium.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Paola Niola"", ids = ""36056520"")",,,,,

A main assumption in current spectral library tools is that a single characteristic intensity pattern (CIP) suffices to describe the fragmentation of a peptide in a particular charge state (peptide charge pair). However, we find that this is often not the case. We carry out a systematic evaluation of spectral variability over public repositories and in-house data sets. We show that spectral variability is widespread and partly occurs under fixed experimental conditions. Using clustering of preprocessed spectra, we derive a limited number of multiple characteristic intensity patterns (MCIPs) for each peptide charge pair, which allow almost complete coverage of our heterogeneous data set without affecting the false discovery rate. We show that a MCIP library derived from public repositories performs in most cases similar to a ""custom-made"" spectral library, which has been acquired under identical experimental conditions as the query spectra. We apply the MCIP approach to a DIA data set and observe a significant increase in peptide recognition. We propose the MCIP approach as an easy-to-implement addition to current spectral library search engines and as a new way to utilize the data stored in spectral repositories.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Constantin Ammar"", ids = ""83062601""); list(name = ""Evi Berchtold"", ids = ""46921331""); list(name = ""Gergely Csaba"", ids = ""35086738""); list(name = ""Andreas Schmidt"", ids = ""39761860""); list(name = ""Axel Imhof"", ids = ""145112223""); list(name = ""Ralf Zimmer"", ids = ""143791297"")",,,Journal of proteome research,18 4,"

We used a mixture model, which involves differentially expressed (DE) genes and non-DE genes, to analyze FDR theoretically, and described an approach to explicitly connect the sample size with the theoretical FDR. Based on this approach, we recommend the minimum sample size for one-sample microarray experimental design is eight slides. Several FDR controlling procedures including four FDR controlling procedures presented by Reiner et al. and the q-value method proposed by Storey and Tibshirani (ST) to identify DE genes for microarray experiment have been proposed. In this paper, we modified these FDR methods, and used simulation based on the mixture model to evaluate the performance of these FDR controlling procedures for one-sample microarray studies. From the simulation study, it is found that ST point-estimate FDR is the best estimating FDR procedure for most scenarios.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Jianmei Song"", ids = ""1905321""); list(name = ""Peter C.

We studied gene expression signatures in venous ECs collected from HF patients and compared to those from healthy subjects to gain insights into the pathobiology of the venous endothelium in HF patients. Methods: 29 symptomatic (NYHA Class II-III) out-patients with compensated HF (28% female, aged 50Â±12 years) and 16 healthy subjects (31% female, aged 38Â±9 years) were studied. ECs were collected from arm veins using endovascular wires. Magnetic beads coated with EC specific antibodies were used for EC separation; amplified mRNA was analyzed by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Microarray. mRNA data were normalized and differential gene expression between HF patients and controls was studied using generalized linear regression models. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% was used to determine statistical significance. Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) identified possible biological pathways impacted in the vascular endothelium of HF patients. Results: No adverse events were observed. Peripheral venous pressure in HF patients was 8Â±3mmHg vs. 5Â±2 mmHg in healthy subjects (p Conclusion: We provide the first comparison of venous EC gene expression between HF patients and healthy controls. A large number of genes and signaling pathways of possible relevance to HF were differentially expressed among HF patents. These data can help generate novel insights into the pathobiology of endothelial dysfunction in HF by identifying yet unrecognized biologic pathways for more focused study.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paolo Colombo"", ids = ""145838367""); list(name = ""Duygu Onat"", ids = ""48310816""); list(name = ""Ante Harxhi"", ids = ""31751323""); list(name = ""Yacki Hayashi"", ids = ""21897521""); list(name = ""Ka Yuk Wong"", ids = ""9825085""); list(name = ""Panos N.

To investigate gene expression variation between sexes and populations in a single somatic tissue, we performed a quantitative analysis of the Malpighian tubule transcriptome in adult males and females of Drosophila melanogaster derived from two distinct populations (one from sub-Saharan Africa and one from northern Europe). We identified 2308 genes that differed in expression between the sexes and 2474 genes that differed in expression between populations at a false discovery rate of 5%. We also identified more than 1000 genes that showed a sex-by-population interaction in their expression. The genes that differed in expression between sexes showed enrichment for a wide variety of functions, although only 55% of them overlapped with sex-biased genes identified in whole-fly studies. The genes expressed differentially between populations included several that were previously implicated in adaptive regulatory evolution, an excess of cytochrome P450 genes, and many genes that were not detected in previous studies of whole flies. Our results demonstrate that there is abundant intraspecific gene expression variation within in a single, somatic tissue and uncover new candidates for adaptive regulatory evolution between populations.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ann Kathrin Huylmans"", ids = ""123013517""); list(name = ""John Parsch"", ids = ""2269228"")",c1f2b4f66dc4211bff5d3bae6bb72a5501450e41; a03503fb3574053093b01bb94cc55f3763f31c7f; 9f6c0510620527e993bea0dc4c2cb414ac24a1d5; 5beae755040ff6c0dd33e13c88614868c71a1b4f; eaeaee81f94efa10866d4a03935acde7a2c4f0aa; 561ac133b2fce09030cd73ecb46ec745025d0588; 33d7edc61c96d44def1eb8d32feb7304cb9aaf11; 2835733fce8855e96bcb5647b16f37b29fd207c8; 2c2ea2e6b8310afc6908c285b42922e025f19d46; 2ee7d3fbe0958c26df82e18cd28118a05ce6f289; f3477c7ec8b0bac9da080cc88cc9fc93ce43132f; 9ec3c77eb52321e19672098141a56113a369fe48; b24dc146750a0ec64e853a726ca4100638c0e002; 8a9a6bf585251122c1cc112d05fb04fb12c0e2b8; 3247b43691f86ac4880a41854d2e4ada21167337; 096a281d5c6b6fdf563fe305ad3ac44981209819; 0a2a5a47bd7cf1e356c5a3b0fd13f58a516bfda3; 27840052f9fd71f3e6b37d052745ee85a77ae3be; fbca218eebf84a00f7ced29d4c98a469172de3e7; 4c91fbd6d315773623761e4a8dc5d711a0c6cac6,4221099f144c4384fa467c0733cfa5ebeccab5ac; 20996662d2fa59d9485f0736e5c072f4849b1030; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; dbfd7d9d9ce538c33ed7a8262c8c955f0e02798d; 4f4e20d943b289aeeb94c3b77837b9c3af37bd49; 33c881581616764aaf8d0f51dc8fbbb5824de055; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; 73066062f66b066d1a1fb24832cd88e9930c7f29; 55abcad87b10f881830ba1cc9263324a4dc9535f; 201a11431179524bfb454c0a4f61a1bae7c25a3c; 11f4c5ee4f523af675476fa1a258fb63a7c3926a; 52e7970a38411a0d3068abefa7907db249163259; dd639233bb00d7495eba3ac90697085463e688e1; 78d1e4c5945bba0dee7512b0345bc9879cd63a38; f0b49f3714299b42f089335af38dd73633d8b30c; 3fb13a0fb4926bc18f3bfe9fba8689b779c9506f; e018c66a26e5711120dc4d805d4805714995b938; bc5265fc16bcd8211f2695ad9f840c1b62fb96b6; 07cff476575f491a88b63cd5ca3625687f871d5b; 4bd0a4fadf32a52711b7101753090cdd9a568d13; 317ec5f3b68df654b44c54c3ce3aec22bdc1dead; 7c4bafd0e5347a73f29ff4a29a7670e95a6365e9; a8948c5fd9841784de3b2980eb444fa1b6b3bcef; 236f4275a7a2db3db8e901aea5d6469c601b0732; a2e71299a91719a54132435b3f83c9cc45b70454; 016a82814b3e46e6a2440b24f69815c25d1d68d6; 238238a0057e7767657ea1bdec4d72a59d3594bf; 1ff6ca0cea7b8b6f58d956445576076c253fc211; 0cabd7c8ae7d8bb5533f920da6b4a5670977c6fb; 877c7ff51dfddf7d5115edccb9be12db96a53b80; b6fe0a7d3a28ff2c073b0460f50fd22c3f5b89fc; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 5b809fd4d7b9f57d52a62087e6d56ba8ae0ab3d2; 2b53ca29e3f3dd14373a4d0f349fcf278e99f101; 78e329d23b17087556c91d1f625e8ddf5f454037; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; b80e4cf735b34b260ec3dc53040fc1027a41b558; 6b1bf0015b8aae18793a0a32d6f88dbf06f02a6b; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 5d277085167590b37a2612640da548c0c55bae7c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4c90eac522f69f0abf8726afbcd642c023753efa; 72a9a56ee0672fede9516f1df2c0a0854eb3685e; 430236a3d1b7aa9f67aa2107833308d7d5528698; 52d2d5d886746c68fa2184da9553a7fff7f549f5,G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics,4,2307 - 2315

Microarrays were utilized to detect differentially expressed genes and MicroRNAs. According to gene values, significance level (p values) and false discovery rate with a random variance model, combining the GO and KEGG database, node genes and key MicroRNAs in network were obtained and analyzed.Results: A total of 878 differentially expressed genes and 26 MicroRNAs were discovered. Not all of these genes have biological effects on the development of ALD. By combining the gene ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, 16 significantly different pathways were found, where 31 corresponding genes participated in.Calculating betweenness centrality of each gene in network, which can describe the degree of importance of the nodes in the whole net. In co-expression network of genes, the node genes modulating the network were ACSF3, FZD5, LOC727987 and C1orf222. And in MicroRNA-Gene network the key MicroRNAs were hsa-miR-570, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-34b, hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-922 and hsa-miR-185 they negatively regulated about 79 genes locate their downstream.Conclusions: In the course of the ALD, we found 4 differentially expressed node genes in network and analyzed Acyl-coenzyme A synthetase-3 (ACSF3) , the maximal betweenness centrality in the entire gene-modulating network was 0.102935, indicating its controlling capability and significance level. Continuous up-regulation of ACSF3 maintains transcriptional activation and subsequently strengthens the binding of ACSF3 to thioester and CoA to activate fatty acids, which results in the irreversible advancement of ALD from hepatitis to cirrhosis. The gene values of Frizzled-5(FZD5) in alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis were clearly downregulated. The second highest value of betweenness centrality in the entire gene-modulating network was 0.087. A possible mechanism may be that continuous down-regulation of FZD5 during advancement of alcoholic hepatitis to cirrhosis decreased gene activities and syntheses of multi-transmembrane transport proteins. This reduced the number of Î²-catenin molecules in hepatocytes and therefore promoted hepatocyte apoptosis. The other two genes' functions were unknown. And the 6 key MicroRNAs perhaps controlled numerous biology functions such as immune response, activity of cancer gene, inflammatory mediated response, cell cycle, glutathione metabolism.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between local gray matter volume and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) logical/verbal memory (WMS-R-verbal) score in healthy adults using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).MethodsT1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained in 1,169 healthy adults. The T1-weighted images in native space were bias-corrected, spatially normalized, and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid images with Statistical Parametric Mapping 5. To investigate regionally the specific effects of the WMS-R-verbal score on the gray matter images, simple regression analysis was performed by VBM treating age, total intracranial volume, and gender as confounding covariates. A P value of less than 0.05 corrected with false discovery rate in voxel difference was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsOur study showed a significant positive correlation between the WMS-R-verbal score and the bilateral entorhinal cortex volume. In the right entorhinal, T value is 4.75, and the size of the clusters is 155 voxels. In the left entorhinal, T value is 4.08, and the size of the clusters is 23 voxels. A significant negative correlation was not found.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first VBM study showing that entorhinal cortex volume is positively correlated with the WMS-R-verbal score for healthy subjects. Therefore, in our structural neuroimaging study, we add evidence to the hypothesis that the entorhinal cortex is involved in verbal memory processing.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Masami Goto"", ids = ""50224782""); list(name = ""Osamu Abe"", ids = ""143815291""); list(name = ""Tosiaki Miyati"", ids = ""3133424""); list(name = ""Takeharu Yoshikawa"", ids = ""10095699""); list(name = ""Naoto Hayashi"", ids = ""2389150""); list(name = ""Hidemasa Takao"", ids = ""34589380""); list(name = ""Sachiko Inano"", ids = ""3217025""); list(name = ""Hiroyuki Kabasawa"", ids = ""4291769""); list(name = ""Harushi Mori"", ids = ""1709112""); list(name = ""Akira Kunimatsu"", ids = ""3134060""); list(name = ""Shigeki Aoki"", ids = ""145567021""); list(name = ""Kenji Ino"", ids = ""2486781""); list(name = ""Kyouhito Iida"", ids = ""8255975""); list(name = ""Keiichi Yano"", ids = ""3110929""); list(name = ""Kuni Ohtomo"", ids = ""3022271"")",14ecb772e211a8c06b91ffbe3c2f07ba51bc3673; 9f8b94e0055d48b4e17797edd498f6721a31296f; 9b894988f57eca23f9a52cefc2741147a1279b92; 9b5e67ddcaeb5cab0dc13806c84fb09eab918bfc; f62d16ae03d32b378d1c3179ab4d7efad0315215; 6c431a9d26c9ff4bf2bc52565f0ff3ce36999d58; 052e991bd9fbc2d79fc51a35b35c2d106fc23737; abb3269cbfef81a2201709dd010625e1fa60e435; 40e1b449888cc3f3ae72c83be514c2d9bbb87ea6; afb6a98aeaf7312265dec98c8a9cbb94c6395ee6,12c431efad1b2cc69472609728069b4f2fb930af; 8c3b406bac24f08c35faa08ec7de7172361c7cd6; 236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda; 128152969b38a8606cfb4f425538f2aa2b97a227; 50e5c458655951b5661c042d00831c3551f79786; 864bdbed5eed178abaa4d3ddfe76d2a4ac5c6c81; f1c926ee760247c74d6ebdd36d903512942d774c; 781ee20481f4e2e4accfa2b1cd6d70d5854bb171; 542021bebfb1c293ac9b768fa38bf285d075704b; 8f25482d438cf561345d67e29fcc61b16d8257b6; 775c2d90f3198ae255ce11714b21a45f0775991c; 783307601c60b6be1e55949ef2f94ab31b6d7d2b; 5a1db418841cb29323cd0e25f91654068157b87d; d3336e951eaef94df864f6c514a7757a5a76ef41; 7cb90c3a4f327ccfe71b1ea9d49cc7ea791a4de4; 38b44a0f30e322b8ea0f9a93dbb608ca55e9a959; 48cc846be2997cd9bb19c14c932a88c07e716f86; a9b94161163b85b00aefa575e982dd2d433ba40c; dbbe693d9b07fb23410d40d1be2ab86901f84d9f; b04b93b735bf66d4e2702d8f68b227a2504f42ec; 8b19f5669a75059c092e3d8908cfd7f2a7d702dd; 9e28ae5dd53fa1a8645545a7fb476b0ce2323021; 6bff053fd4e70ee304a70d6c56d624e9fd4ba7f1; f23a91e82c1940c40f235ff0db08bda3582b38e4; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 79e174ac3d95197e9e08ecd5b8641d7b9cc8553c; 2553a9e30dc7c10d10bddd743aeb72862826961e; fc1c3faed0700b1c0e8bddfd5a1c5f6a6a0fd616; 5829a7ea7294463f4496d87ba1ceaff260edc53f; d48e15ee1087a67748525ba9f4aa9583ad88f728; d341c8726735badfeba473deaa1fc8ce5ca62506; 6f7069b153f629e3ae4693c1bc55f5acf4cde359; fef487aa661036e18d5e12d78e466ca01b5fbb91; 86db0a51e2899c125016f5e3c266c7f396a822ff; 59374a10de807912409c5866b50099635853460d; 2b25647999dcaf5830a217d53bef0399da8f92f3; e22dfe0e786fe16fe9e90ca6cf598353ddd2c9f3; 65296ef689724c1fe7582896e121b7635e1cc3ef; 643677b680b136a81c93ecb6b09e74efc3eca179; 62155041627358da53d8bbba2addaf16df32e6b7; df4375e6043b9cd0e8f03aabd0350353b44f386c; bb0c47ba1b1b792efa01d9f248294c7c39f3b81b; 622417ac2e9058868b97c078a6ac5985ee16eaf3; da6a2ab567a42381c0a114baff41940820114277; adf27a10b84517662ad4b209a9020a5e897417c7; a9f5651a55970b011a667072058c21ab6dc421c1,Neuroradiology,53,617-622

Positron emission tomography, superresolution, and network traffic monitoring are some examples. Inference in such settings requires solving a sequence of ill-posed inverse problems, y(t) = Ax(t), where the projection mechanism provides information on A. We consider problems in which A specifies mixing on a graph of times series that are bursty and sparse. We develop a multilevel state-space model for mixing times series and an efficient approach to inference. A simple model is used to calibrate regularization parameters that lead to efficient inference in the multilevel statespace model. We apply this method to the problem of estimating point-topoint traffic flows on a network from aggregate measurements. Our solution outperforms existing methods for this problem, and our two-stage approach suggests an efficient inference strategy for multilevel models of multivariate time series. A Gibbs sampler approach to controlling false discovery rate under unknown false null distributions and correlation Brien Aronov University of Connecticut This presentation describes a new technique for controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) under the situation of correlated test statistics with an unknown false null distribution through the use of a Gibbs Sampler. I then provide simulations to show that the technique has higher power for rejecting false null hypotheses that the BH Algorithm in some cases where the BH Procedure does well itself. I also show via simulation that the algorithm appears to correctly control the FDR rate in some cases of incomplete information. In addition, comparing the algorithm with incomplete information to the BH Procedure with that information correcting specified actually leads to the algorithm obtaining higher power.

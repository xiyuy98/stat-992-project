Protection in humans is strongly correlated with the production of T cells targeting a heterogeneous population of pre-erythrocyte antigen proteoforms, including liver stage antigens. Currently, few T cell epitopes derived from Plasmodium falciparum, the major aetiologic agent of malaria in humans are known.MethodsIn this study both in vitro and in vivo malaria liver stage models were used to sequence host and pathogen proteoforms. Proteoforms from these diverse models were subjected to mild acid elution (of soluble forms), multi-dimensional fractionation, tandem mass spectrometry, and top-down bioinformatics analysis to identify proteoforms in their intact state.ResultsThese results identify a group of host and malaria liver stage proteoforms that meet a 5% false discovery rate threshold.ConclusionsThis work provides proof-of-concept for the validity of this mass spectrometry/bioinformatic approach for future studies seeking to reveal malaria liver stage antigens towards vaccine development.",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Benjamin Y Winer"", ids = ""48709262""); list(name = ""Kimberly A.

24675dab10a4dd07d91231c887787cdb8908361a,Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Methylation and Cigarette Smoking in a Chinese Population,"BACKGROUND
Smoking is a risk factor for many human diseases. DNA methylation has been related to smoking, but genome-wide methylation data for smoking in Chinese populations is limited.


OBJECTIVES
We aimed to investigate epigenome-wide methylation in relation to smoking in a Chinese population.


METHODS
We measured the methylation levels at > 485,000 CpG sites (CpGs) in DNA from leukocytes using a methylation array and conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of DNA methylation and smoking in a total of 596 Chinese participants. We further evaluated the associations of smoking-related CpGs with internal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) biomarkers and their correlations with the expression of corresponding genes.


RESULTS
We identified 318 CpGs whose methylation levels were associated with smoking at a genome-wide significance level (false discovery rate < 0.05), among which 161 CpGs annotated to 123 genes were not associated with smoking in recent studies of Europeans and African Americans. Of these smoking-related CpGs, methylation levels at 80 CpGs showed significant correlations with the expression of corresponding genes (including RUNX3, IL6R, PTAFR, ANKRD11, CEP135 and CDH23), and methylation at 15 CpGs was significantly associated with urinary 2-hydroxynaphthalene, the most representative internal monohydroxy-PAH biomarker for smoking.


CONCLUSION
We identified DNA methylation markers associated with smoking in a Chinese population, including some markers that were also correlated with gene expression. Exposure to naphthalene, a byproduct of tobacco smoke, may contribute to smoking-related methylation.

This may be mediated in part via enhanced exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to impact neurogenesis. We aimed to identify molecular mediators of these effects, focusing on long-lasting epigenetic changes. In a human hippocampal progenitor cell (HPC) line, we assessed the short- and long-term effects of GC exposure during neurogenesis on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. GC exposure induced changes in DNAm at 27,812 CpG dinucleotides and in the expression of 3,857 transcripts (false discovery rate [FDR] â‰¤ 0.1 and absolute fold change [FC] expression â‰¥ 1.15). HPC expression and GC-affected DNAm profiles were enriched for changes observed during human fetal brain development. Differentially methylated sites (DMSs) with GC exposure clustered into 4 trajectories over HPC differentiation, with transient as well as long-lasting DNAm changes. Lasting DMSs mapped to distinct functional pathways and were selectively enriched for poised and bivalent enhancer marks. Lasting DMSs had little correlation with lasting expression changes but were associated with a significantly enhanced transcriptional response to a second acute GC challenge. A significant subset of lasting DMSs was also responsive to an acute GC challenge in peripheral blood. These tissue-overlapping DMSs were used to compute a polyepigenetic score that predicted exposure to conditions associated with altered prenatal GCs in newborn's cord blood DNA. Overall, our data suggest that early exposure to GCs can change the set point of future transcriptional responses to stress by inducing lasting DNAm changes. Such altered set points may relate to differential vulnerability to stress exposure later in life.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nadine ProvenÃ§al"", ids = ""4517020""); list(name = ""Janine Arloth"", ids = ""5399989""); list(name = ""Annamaria Cattaneo"", ids = ""153615232""); list(name = ""Christoph Anacker"", ids = ""48244582""); list(name = ""Nadia Cattane"", ids = ""46852729""); list(name = ""Tobias Wiechmann"", ids = ""34730870""); list(name = ""Simone RÃ¶h"", ids = ""3874826""); list(name = ""Maik Koedel"", ids = ""90679432""); list(name = ""Torsten Klengel"", ids = ""5406173""); list(name = ""Darina Czamara"", ids = ""6204430""); list(name = ""Nikola S.

4172d5f8ce61b96715236caa7f677a48690d19b7,Identification and characterization of novel conserved RNA structures in Drosophila,"BackgroundComparative genomics approaches have facilitated the discovery of many novel non-coding and structured RNAs (ncRNAs). The increasing availability of related genomes now makes it possible to systematically search for compensatory base changes â€“ and thus for conserved secondary structures â€“ even in genomic regions that are poorly alignable in the primary sequence. The wealth of available transcriptome data can add valuable insight into expression and possible function for new ncRNA candidates. Earlier work identifying ncRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster made use of sequence-based alignments and employed a sliding window approach, inevitably biasing identification toward RNAs encoded in the more conserved parts of the genome.ResultsTo search for conserved RNA structures (CRSs) that may not be highly conserved in sequence and to assess the expression of CRSs, we conducted a genome-wide structural alignment screen of 27 insect genomes including D. melanogaster and integrated this with an extensive set of tiling array data. The structural alignment screen revealed âˆ¼30,000 novel candidate CRSs at an estimated false discovery rate of less than 10%. With more than one quarter of all individual CRS motifs showing sequence identities below 60%, the predicted CRSs largely complement the findings of sliding window approaches applied previously. While a sixth of the CRSs were ubiquitously expressed, we found that most were expressed in specific developmental stages or cell lines. Notably, most statistically significant enrichment of CRSs were observed in pupae, mainly in exons of untranslated regions, promotors, enhancers, and long ncRNAs. Interestingly, cell lines were found to express a different set of CRSs than were found in vivo. Only a small fraction of intergenic CRSs were co-expressed with the adjacent protein coding genes, which suggests that most intergenic CRSs are independent genetic units.ConclusionsThis study provides a more comprehensive view of the ncRNA transcriptome in fly as well as evidence for differential expression of CRSs during development and in cell lines.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebecca Kirsch"", ids = ""34981869""); list(name = ""Stefan E.

705294c867d78d78459ea30ab67212ab6e55b6cb,On fuzzy familywise error rate and false discovery rate procedures for discrete distributions,"Fuzzy multiple comparisons procedures are introduced as a solution to the problem of multiple comparisons for discrete test statistics. The critical function of the randomized p-values is proposed as a measure of evidence against the null hypotheses. The classical concept of randomized tests is extended to multiple comparisons. This approach makes all theory of multiple comparisons developed for continuously distributed statistics automatically applicable to the discrete case. Examples of familywise error rate and false discovery rate procedures are discussed and an application to linkage disequilibrium testing is given. Software for implementing the procedures is available.

5fdfab0a1464785023baa3c8c3e11864d82c7706,The effects on cognitive functions of a movement-based intervention in patients with Alzheimer's type dementia: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the effect of a non-aerobic movement based activity on cognition in people with Alzheimer's type dementia (AD).


METHODS
The sample consisted of 27 patients fulfilling the AD ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. The patient sample was randomly divided into two groups: The Exercise Group received 6 weeks movement training and comprised 15 participants with a mean age of 70.5 years (SD: 8). Control Group participated in a standard care group, which served as a control intervention, and consisted of 12 patients with an average age of 75.7 years (SD: 6.90). Cognitive functions were assessed using six computerised tests from the CANTAB, pre and post training. Data were analysed using t-tests. The false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple comparisons as well as Cohen's d effect size was used to assess the significant effects.


RESULTS
Significant improvements in sustained attention, visual memory and a trend in working memory were found in the Exercise Group compared to Control Group after the 6 weeks training. In addition, after 6 weeks the Control Group deteriorated significantly in attention, while the AD patients who undertook the physical exercise showed a discrete improvement.


CONCLUSIONS
The present study shows that a short course of non-aerobic movement based exercise is already effective at least in some aspects of cognitive functioning in patients with AD. Although the present study is a pilot study with small samples, nevertheless, the results are promising for the further investigation and development of non-aerobic movement programmes.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lidia YÃ¡gÃ¼ez"", ids = ""50144182""); list(name = ""Kendra N Shaw"", ids = ""32195715""); list(name = ""Robin Morris"", ids = ""50641844""); list(name = ""David Matthews"", ids = ""144653098"")",efcbbff4903196a661ab11cfd1875a2e18316857; 2ceb2753d4dbd529658d95793471cb8b45ef7279; 872985f9ea3ef72ec6ba11313cce5516f511ff40; c5227814bc14973f56b18379dc08eea3ea79676f; 5f9b32ec3b57313d3db19706daa8605990f13e35; d830763812faeb91ed8aa516357fd57fe820b652; 44a5686a2623ba79362a3bf468365e92aabfe5bd; 63dab08ee20f663fe3a26478fd4ab9282928c9e7; 6d783fa4c5a1b615cfd0e41f89e94cb9380ef00f; 674e4a3211b1fc0697bf3eb16c6f8b6f242b795f; ddfd3ba8d1a9a8ec12068d5eefa8cf362c3171e0; 47f9f8217d6cec22f48b7ecbef53576e411ba568; f26375be9edcf83f5f6e1db0ef57228663ce6070; 254d323dd26eadc3f4dfae8e8b3b857dd0d384e9; f9384cb055a7be46a7809ebe2adfff9be4997fad; dddf2925697d9021e55a8f4ca799d97ed3c31bb3; 54482c3024c1c0c2559bd8d77cdf06384f4de4ae; e2efc01d8dc811b083699e40ba9d1ca10bf91493; fb12e34c3a178ebbe7b398503fa7bb7d73550d04; ad5945b0322e81adff523d3443939dfef4d272e8; df8b17dd3880b910cca24bebed85916c936000bb; eac789e7bab370b2da59612d5628dbd93850dc5b; f13b955acd1f875005caf63a26bc93967fb4853f; 9fd140fe6612e5f337b5b7bea5e1cd6c88c14f8e; 0bc3becff65c4edff783c539884f6e7187648552; 77cb2260af4ede2fa2e4a967d42273621315ce80; ee02dfb0d8a048f7fd2d9ce9a594b5e4fa61c3c8; 090cf7b2bf3d32c625b5df96ded3a8bfc920d2a6; bf9ab807585c3493f969734d4b7e8195b36483ab; 40ffd350f7f2f5db7e50e0d1d3eb8a9496cb1fb1; 1f1890ecdd40a3f5b86c689daac7731faceb02f2; 0a0e3a10456dcb16fba5e948cb7a4afcc96e6b88; a16e692f2aa6db7cd07fb052c816828834c4619f; 8ea88e2d6902c41bf9be31b6dfe369800173bb28; 2816832205e7ced03f42f8e22d6833ee50e45183; 49c7999fd641d39ad591f9b8a44cdf07bdb22770; 6e838d971bfbe182e691e8ac7b184fcf77844313; d61613db32e322a4894aae6360a2e16433373255; 1ce3377e9f3ddf709dc409f9a352e16b36216da2; 42b5db38f29a0d4aa339aa0e26402d87854a39f4; 4020d1d10b6988ff91f6c4c571330f9edf2d1404; f480b05dd3609ec79cb951ad47513d8dbe1e4ab5; 911719d8bcaf3eadb8fe93d2a08c82554e88249c; 921346d42158021466934bfb02377dbf4c5a558e; 6b23ddfb6965d5ffce04b9fd8cb51d6dc4cc1984; 21fc949edad72138e2813d33c6623e07198f5a6b; 925dedaa621f83a0a2f418b33108c9dad4097d83; 26c627eb2c4f5fd7ae28281ce4d19d15a9d1e523; 8b60af139c4668a3588c64ec13792b0b428d1db4; e22cb43f56c8fa7ccd1241e89aaa7f4f02b3ce42; c9ec4a4c0953339e8fc35008ba3a67b942b41765; 2a88c47c785c24231d083995dfeaef00e079c8f4; d5671d40c236fcaaa4a88746879c8b840fed78d7; 7f0b71df948cecf86224676ac7ef987b962bf529; 1f7e049ba74a3c4cae819abaa83101224ac2a8c1; 9902c5f929f398d579a6bb8becea47ccdccbc021; 78fad58847472315406c80d4ad53a2d7e6e263cc; 2e6700d2270a88e7a9cec203338ae660112038b3; eec93a88d46add827b31de311e6034c76995941f; ce0dc0edb7a02a0fd36cd731df34af7977ab95c8; fe0f8fd82f550122122cce840f6c8e6f2d458705,7f729c8c5c263f4b2ba2172879ca55c6759a8257; 86b3bf94da27b3d84b78f6d25474a9ce9577e82f; 6ab9b6143ac00a943cd0454372f7d9a1947658a0; a92b46f46e920781bf03141cbed2623fded671b1; cf09b5837c89b58fb51489ac1a88f04d69ad6765; 4ba8e8fe131922285e33985cd8a09d62d96ff4ab; 0a1e1710b0c11bf71993311473524965dd7d14b9; 17cc007d00789882fa9bdf4bfb069118bf628248; 0d3770c018c5a053143ce23b75938c26c3b2db35; e125b9041ebfa167f9601e4adc3aea10f576fbef; 57ce275d16532a4a1df832553cdc80e8945150a7; 58d24184ac79b9ebd699c12b8f440b0d16081858; 3dcfc1a0acea8e85ce2180748402cade0f2a5244; 8b64ccefeefb190b8052f5b2354065f95628e6c5; 4be0749a6b9acb01092a532adaebaf9c8142e2fc; 54d13f35d4fd699026b54a5271e5f163ec257b4c; 00f463581a3d05fa5d7065e060b2c29bb5e4e4fd; b8f22e9dc3d879077ccc3430747303f3f45bdc54; 5aa75cbc57fbe7a0f23ccff9a353e8b0e71ae359; 03dc056351b3026eec019b41f14ae190e205b625; 1ea614145f8f6b8eb4df68be6be67f233db31739; 63f78daa866e282ea2cfe59f25bf7e6482a990d3; 839651458f30dea5ea56a88b98276095593d81f6; 043073e694e9218ad56a56aa61738358f38bfa1f; 6d3b67c59b7e4ef4abf08561e4b9f156316abc93; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 9a3a0e313285527f8415e43935c0153f7e42d0b0; 7b0980a5e9c3f361d9cb38a49a4e4665b3b615b0; d59078affed8548afe9b9e71c85707be2494666f; b951d4833ad73a1ee4db9f389284b94e3acf13d1; ad6125067aaad6af25284132412a7ecbc866d584; 41a389cd82b62f434cac0717b53b77dcdbdbaffd; 6590bf78bcc479c6d03c2b593d47a5366c44438d; 9229a834c084da876e5a0a2c2d92cec1c0d1e2af; 82c51af6ee8d17b644c91043a6a7b3429c3098aa,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,26 2,"

6948bd9580c285aa9ae220f745f62bda414bb551,Algorithms for Detecting Significantly Mutated Pathways in Cancer,"Recent genome sequencing studies have shown that the somatic mutations that drive cancer development are distributed across a large number of genes This mutational heterogeneity complicates efforts to distinguish functional mutations from sporadic, passenger mutations Since cancer mutations are hypothesized to target a relatively small number of cellular signaling and regulatory pathways, a common approach is to assess whether known pathways are enriched for mutated genes However, restricting attention to known pathways will not reveal novel cancer genes or pathways An alterative strategy is to examine mutated genes in the context of genome-scale interaction networks that include both well characterized pathways and additional gene interactions measured through various approaches We introduce a computational framework for de novo identification of subnetworks in a large gene interaction network that are mutated in a significant number of patients This framework includes two major features First, we introduce a diffusion process on the interaction network to define a local neighborhood of â€œinfluenceâ€ for each mutated gene in the network Second, we derive a two-stage multiple hypothesis test to bound the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with the identified subnetworks We test these algorithms on a large human protein-protein interaction network using mutation data from two recent studies: glioblastoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and lung adenocarcinoma samples from the Tumor Sequencing Project We successfully recover pathways that are known to be important in these cancers, such as the p53 pathway We also identify additional pathways, such as the Notch signaling pathway, that have been implicated in other cancers but not previously reported as mutated in these samples Our approach is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a computationally efficient strategy for de novo identification of statistically significant mutated subnetworks We anticipate that our approach will find increasing use as cancer genome studies increase in size and scope.",2010,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fabio Vandin"", ids = ""2852175""); list(name = ""Eli Upfal"", ids = ""1735099""); list(name = ""Benjamin J.

8a25f762baa06aac58455d59cf03778feb85caf6,Higher criticism thresholding: Optimal feature selection when useful features are rare and weak.,"In important application fields today-genomics and proteomics are examples-selecting a small subset of useful features is crucial for success of Linear Classification Analysis. We study feature selection by thresholding of feature Z-scores and introduce a principle of threshold selection, based on the notion of higher criticism (HC). For i = 1, 2, ..., p, let pi(i) denote the two-sided P-value associated with the ith feature Z-score and pi((i)) denote the ith order statistic of the collection of P-values. The HC threshold is the absolute Z-score corresponding to the P-value maximizing the HC objective (i/p - pi((i)))/sqrt{i/p(1-i/p)}. We consider a rare/weak (RW) feature model, where the fraction of useful features is small and the useful features are each too weak to be of much use on their own. HC thresholding (HCT) has interesting behavior in this setting, with an intimate link between maximizing the HC objective and minimizing the error rate of the designed classifier, and very different behavior from popular threshold selection procedures such as false discovery rate thresholding (FDRT). In the most challenging RW settings, HCT uses an unconventionally low threshold; this keeps the missed-feature detection rate under better control than FDRT and yields a classifier with improved misclassification performance. Replacing cross-validated threshold selection in the popular Shrunken Centroid classifier with the computationally less expensive and simpler HCT reduces the variance of the selected threshold and the error rate of the constructed classifier. Results on standard real datasets and in asymptotic theory confirm the advantages of HCT.",2008,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""David L.

644fe0aca9f388b6f1f2f5737d5dcf919c46d419,Learning from Decoys to Improve the Sensitivity and Specificity of Proteomics Database Search Results,"The statistical validation of database search results is a complex issue in bottom-up proteomics. The correct and incorrect peptide spectrum match (PSM) scores overlap significantly, making an accurate assessment of true peptide matches challenging. Since the complete separation between the true and false hits is practically never achieved, there is need for better methods and rescoring algorithms to improve upon the primary database search results. Here we describe the calibration and False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimation of database search scores through a dynamic FDR calculation method, FlexiFDR, which increases both the sensitivity and specificity of search results. Modelling a simple linear regression on the decoy hits for different charge states, the method maximized the number of true positives and reduced the number of false negatives in several standard datasets of varying complexity (18-mix, 49-mix, 200-mix) and few complex datasets (E. coli and Yeast) obtained from a wide variety of MS platforms. The net positive gain for correct spectral and peptide identifications was up to 14.81% and 6.2% respectively. The approach is applicable to different search methodologies--separate as well as concatenated database search, high mass accuracy, and semi-tryptic and modification searches. FlexiFDR was also applied to Mascot results and showed better performance than before. We have shown that appropriate threshold learnt from decoys, can be very effective in improving the database search results. FlexiFDR adapts itself to different instruments, data types and MS platforms. It learns from the decoy hits and sets a flexible threshold that automatically aligns itself to the underlying variables of data quality and size.",2012,Physics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Amit Kumar Yadav"", ids = ""6869288""); list(name = ""Dhirendra Kumar"", ids = ""2092647""); list(name = ""Debasis Dash"", ids = ""4869786"")",a666fa957475f2068fd32e7570c546f3af4fdf3d; 338acd3690bf35f3f4948ad2e550a694c1a29808; d12dbedd09bc06c6f524da865abc1feec8fe33bf; a6f5ca5c369c61bfff8391eab075db371f95c314; 1255eecab5cefa60bee744ea5fc7965b4d8a1a49,8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; e8b24c3ffacc6cee3aeaa9f2c6166567abd9bfb4; 99f3b64a6c909676ba4abdc833fc18c1595ffd00; bb44ad12fb4b1f94e8988aa5dca0fe5f3d612c3a; f390e53848813184a170766b4d6dcbcb4d1aaaee; f1f81de80444276ef9344046527ac367f5eed18f; bed51363dd400f9288bff1a540024326e55a9df4; 298d870d34ffe614b7d1ed4e5782701e38bf6d0f; ec93784390a3f3bea43cd25ed8891ecf2a465494; 674555302c07356dd3d63787fbe3310205cf090e; 5184ba97f21740e4b4d5a1f8b5dc74edd9f946a8; 5c99637ca7251f0a523c17c27b0ad933ba6e2a51; 0d7ee3f200a044b594606c9067bbcd1638ec32e3; 0276686b24498c0bd50239203ab873b284e9c4e3; c36b5b38f2c6bac8e598422a6ad163ffb9107c9f; 3aff2d12ceb545dae034cea8188f37ce40537c71; 8df9f324a8dbd6621e188dfce2fbe83a3a3a3eb0; e713aebcad8975ab52d2ce6f70ee7d891ca89b01; 5552c9544da74fd8a6a1f88c8019973116cce506; e7a193a017e417700678a29d9d5f1c05f2e87ac3; cd226ef73c5f625d6f98a6ead55c31cd0f24da84; c2e13969e0139aa325ab901924cdc8f05cce0732; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; a78493f52a7dfa01aed9086138fd9a636ecc79de; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 02089a851b318d02667e41e70ce0c0e65f2d91d1; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; fdd5af91349ffbfff545adae1a56e5ef9b703807; ac8b3c2033fb9c154367e7e7e44a15cdc7d9d4a9; 72f6efb41bdf5cd47fe3b9a1353b484a0358aa07; 1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; b8ab3bbf27bfc1b4a36aa9c7f06579f9f794d61f; 7771ea81c539c2ff5dc6d239defe4b8c513f3be5; 6136c5261439cc60403196e978ba84bcdeb87e0f; 0cc621c07cd862b550a588ae8b6638928154bab2; 631fe3da480f8d903f574cfb89f6d06c1cef6947; ae87d486daf3af8fa8ca943d9f23b3f7c8955e43; 94ad60ea53f3c58b94ca6a97509842ee0f0b4db5; 2bdbd53ae48d92be98ea00fd7550189d3ca53ce6; 151b9ae9e780787d3e4109fd28dd425d224cb332; 582a8fc085629efbae206e0ffb1697db856435e7; 68d5610b0eab933543da3212a074c743c756a0a7; 60e6d9699f6b90fbb7e35cb566dc136a7524ac70; 9feff6ae17cbd942d2be0d121f2d47dc785abc79; 10c1f6c27beb2a245163ee57fa5c460b3e1218c4; 4fedb766de9e3524d720f470f2265ef6e7b674b5; 48db31e1e79e823bbd807bcb544c8cc502d65209; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874,PLoS ONE,7,
9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6,Exact calculations for false discovery proportion with application to least favorable configurations,"In a context of multiple hypothesis testing, we provide several new exact calculations related to the false discovery proportion (FDP) of step-up and step-down procedures. For step-up procedures, we show that the number of erroneous rejections conditionally on the rejection number is simply a binomial variable, which leads to explicit computations of the c.d.f., the {$s$-th} moment and the mean of the FDP, the latter corresponding to the false discovery rate (FDR). For step-down procedures, we derive what is to our knowledge the first explicit formula for the FDR valid for any alternative c.d.f. of the $p$-values. We also derive explicit computations of the power for both step-up and step-down procedures. These formulas are ``explicit'' in the sense that they only involve the parameters of the model and the c.d.f. of the order statistics of i.i.d. uniform variables. The $p$-values are assumed either independent or coming from an equicorrelated multivariate normal model and an additional mixture model for the true/false hypotheses is used.

As with other common diseases, genetic variants underlying alcoholism have been illusive, possibly due to the small effect from each individual susceptible variant, gene Ã— environment and gene Ã— gene interactions and complications in phenotype definition. We conducted association tests, the family-based association tests (FBAT) and the backward haplotype transmission association (BHTA), on the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) data provided by Genetic Analysis Workshop (GAW) 14. Efron's local false discovery rate method was applied to control the proportion of false discoveries. For FBAT, we compared the results based on different types of genetic markers (single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) versus microsatellites) and different phenotype definitions (clinical diagnoses versus electrophysiological phenotypes). Significant association results were found only between SNPs and clinical diagnoses. In contrast, significant results were found only between microsatellites and electrophysiological phenotypes. In addition, we obtained the association results for SNPs and microsatellites using COGA diagnosis as phenotype based on BHTA. In this case, the results for SNPs and microsatellites are more consistent. Compared to FBAT, more significant markers are detected with BHTA.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Liang Chen"", ids = ""30534560""); list(name = ""Nianjun Liu"", ids = ""40111761""); list(name = ""Shuang Wang"", ids = ""39888986""); list(name = ""Cheongeun Oh"", ids = ""3683670""); list(name = ""Nicholas Carriero"", ids = ""2536838""); list(name = ""Hongyu Zhao"", ids = ""145400502"")",372510159cc52abae661ae3e3b5ab3eff96c7535; 61d75dcd4c324e703e41335babe1bea2581240c1; 80391bd49f9863dc6e3cfb042d64239708e7e2a3,2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; d3b5313257945c575a743047b6d6a8c522952492; d598bc52b1aaaf9fb54520bfb2eb8dc3c3a9b0e4; 9c7d98fb40d5a4d3cfac372a711d4c108c4945d7; dfc1c556076ab42b3162e057342ce293e7855eef; 7d8d37f76cd6d2f7ef7233ee0b925a1bd8002f56; 99aacd247b2fe3f8b2d22119256dc9e53dd6cdfa; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,BMC Genetics,6,S130 - S130

Die Selektion basiert auf einer multiplen Testprozedur die die False Discovery Rate (FDR) einhalt. Mit jenen, mit Hilfe der multiplen Testprozedur selektierten, Variablen soll ein prognostischer Score konstruiert werden, mit dem man den klinischen Endpunkt eines zukunftigen Patienten vorhersagen kann. Dieser lineare Score wird aufgrund der resultierenden Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) bewertet. Die Selektionsgrenze fur die FDR, welche die beste Flache unter der ROC-Kurve (AUC) liefert ist allerdings von unbekannten Parametern wie z.B. der Effektgrose oder der Anzahl der Variablen, die tatsachlich einen Einfluss auf den klinischen Endpunkt haben stark abhangig. 
 
Um in einem spezifischen Datensatz nach der optimalen Selektionsschranke zu suchen wird die Verwendung einer Prozedur zur Kreuzvalidierung vorgeschlagen. Diese Prozedur (i) ermittelt ein adaquates Selektionskriterium fur die multiple Testprozedur, (ii) berechnet einen (positiv verzerrten) Schatzer fur die AUC fur zukunftige Prognosen und (iii) liefert einen Schatzer fur die FDR, der nahe der wahren FDR ist. Daruber hinaus geben niedrige Werte der ermittelten kreuzvalidierten AUC und grose Werte der kreuzvalidierten FDR einen Hinweis darauf, dass der Einfluss der Variablen auf den klinischen Endpunkt zu gering ist und/oder dass die gegebene Stichprobengrose zu gering ist um die gegebenen Effekte zu finden.",2008,Physics,"list(name = ""Alexandra Christine Graf"", ids = ""144143093"")",,49f4143eb35926b031df823eeed0458ed40e2f40; 63ab35a1aba429a7469b4d3be02095270464ee4a; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e0d6680b485b5c1c0eb66144e50ec801e481532d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 0e7fd9422eaa403b80d708588d48b7d98abe5d63; f8d6ae6fc369bc9023478ccc608efdee8f0f1056; 154bbeafb23144ca2374afdedd1a83786fff449f; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 453ad9b414c1b35492e7b5b455cfca5684556e9c; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 7c1051b504053a0cac20a1441b2bb0440c430d02; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d8d5b759b06e6c00c6a0a2133fa785e938c783ec; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; aedf452469b3babc395a7d3071eee564eff7e4f5; de8f34d8d24e1c8a432c81927bcf7b301804fa11; c4ee7ed648e06f330765ec194f76bbcabc059cbb; cfc17cd473f2c2769c55a0546fefc9b393a31f12; 9a3c652893eaccaec83cd12bd7a3c972577edf8b; e0149f4926373368a0d88f7fb57c5549500fd83a; 1f1b750baf5b0fa427c5b38379cdcc8d70634d36; fc17610fc4d56c7a4646fffd6622602e288189bf; bc37489e7173c75be152b2fcea35191c68847ab2; b14df019c9cfd381762cefd51fa6bab85c2733aa; 1b6ab6bace543582dd69e7c88f51464787363575; f4890345d1f0547606508185cf65d49613fbd423; dca1c4d94db784a7a91e441481d8e7b83de5c6f5; e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0; 2938045f3292d182402dd073209ab58b7dff4c68; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 60f788264e6278374be9dabd8e2a644cc65129b6; 3ea5160839adde27eab46b96b2ec41ed8305ddb6; 4d0c0d90fbcd63f3df0c9ce986a4de8c2f4b4bae,,,

Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved study, a public NSCLC data set that contained fluorine 18 ((18)F) fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) and messenger RNA expression profile data (n = 26) was obtained, and patients were categorized on the basis of measured normalized SUVmax values. Significance analysis of microarrays was then used to create a radiogenomic signature. The prognostic ability of this signature was assessed in a second independent data set that consisted of clinical and messenger RNA expression data (n = 166). Signature concordance with EMT was evaluated by means of validation in a publicly available cell line data set. Finally, by establishing an in vitro EMT lung cancer cell line model, an attempt was made to substantiate the radiogenomic signature with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and functional assays were performed, including Western blot, cell migration, glucose transporter, and hexokinase assays (paired t test), as well as pharmacologic assays against chemotherapeutic agents (half-maximal effective concentration). Results Differential expression analysis yielded a 14-gene radiogenomic signature (P < .05, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.20), which was confirmed to have differences in disease-specific survival (log-rank test, P = .01). This signature also significantly overlapped with published EMT cell line gene expression data (P < .05, FDR < 0.20). Finally, an EMT cell line model was established, and cells that had undergone EMT differentially expressed this signature and had significantly different EMT protein expression (P < .05, FDR < 0.20), cell migration, glucose uptake, and hexokinase activity (paired t test, P < .05). Cells that had undergone EMT also had enhanced chemotherapeutic resistance, with a higher half-maximal effective concentration than that of cells that had not undergone EMT (P < .05). Conclusion Integrative radiogenomic analysis demonstrates an association between increased normalized (18)F fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET SUVmax, outcome, and EMT in NSCLC.

These challenges have led to many biological oversights and computational misconceptions. We developed a complete empirical Bayes model to analyze multi-protein complex (MPC) proteomics data derived from peptide mass spectrometry detections of purified protein complex pull-down experiments. Our model considers not only bait-prey associations, but also prey-prey associations missed in previous work. Using our model and a yeast MPC proteomics data set, we estimated that there should be an average of 28 true associations per MPC, almost ten times as high as was previously estimated. For data sets generated to mimic a real proteome, our model achieved on average 80% sensitivity in detecting true associations, as compared with the 3% sensitivity in previous work, while maintaining a comparable false discovery rate of 0.3%",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Changyu Shen"", ids = ""51504465""); list(name = ""Lang Li"", ids = ""40659130""); list(name = ""Jake Yue Chen"", ids = ""1710821"")",567735eafba1b3e80fa1a7cf05ccb00ea07999bc,8c48222c90bbeff0bcddad3cea75e4581167a190; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; d677a75abedcff5b335e6be18fb7e1858824833c; e7148e7327e8445c736510c3681a999c6cf8203b; ea47263edd2a9b9d472ae6a60b4c99270bbf65f3; ea9a3f25f769257dbd577d92b61a642c431d1c3f; 78220a47b69a359905920f2ea943c93f25f28cc6; 5d87397679cb2d2265d85707af5ddf9a494d23c4; a5dbef69ba1d20eba56fd3500049a71322dffbaa; 1df327ba125dcdb9845b2d9feeca82bba6c197a0; 5fc9c2fa64be48d5876ab88810058da02202b401; 45d43d4764c0211f441e0d81738711d0c3c9dcf0; 1820458278e4346c8af62b2a50747ccc72f1cc63; 3416a9e618f42ae68d7788775b68becaa46f6999; 10560eb0110d3930cae9c6e4d404e394d0dc4270; 2e3edd8a7614a2c2055110bb68342bab99e78667; c3777a30ff0679b56f712324c93ad1b0ecb4ed46; 433389bdf55c706ed6ba53401186191f529b931a; 0f7414463da8fbc71c4fa4128e6e07c1581fd05f; fded6f9cefb06c1da7acddd5b9b89b1eabb08b7d; 8406f3cf1b74a090420a8643cd8eb3e05c7dd646,2005 IEEE Computational Systems Bioinformatics Conference (CSB'05),,167-174
e65491187ef1984c96539d15f758f294a5dfbd77,A weighted false discovery rate control procedure reveals alleles at FOXA2 that influence fasting glucose levels.,"Association signals in GWAS are usually prioritized solely by p values. Here, we attempt to improve the power of GWAS by using a weighted false discovery rate control procedure to detect associations of low-frequency variants with effect sizes similar to or even larger than those of common variants. We used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to test for association with fasting glucose levels in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) population. In addition to finding several previously identified sequence variations, we identified a low-frequency variant (rs1209523; minor allele frequency = 0.043) near FOXA2 that was associated with fasting glucose levels in European Americans (EAs) (n = 7428, p value = 1.3 x 10(-5)). The association between rs1209523 and glucose levels was also significant in African Americans (AAs) (n = 2029, p value = 6.7 x 10(-3)) of the ARIC and was confirmed by replication in both EAs and AAs of the Dallas Heart Study (n = 963 and 1571, respectively; p values = 5.3 x 10(-3) and 5.8 x 10(-4), respectively) and in EAs of the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study (n = 2862; p value = 1.6 x 10(-2)). A meta-analysis of these five populations yielded an estimated effect size of -1.31 mg/dl per minor allele (p value = 2.2 x 10(-11)). This study reveals that there is a cache of less-frequent variants in GWAS arrays that can be identified via analytical approaches accounting for allele frequencies.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chao Xing"", ids = ""1694501""); list(name = ""Jonathan C.

7b332ea49d3103c1f1237fa86226a5cf1ecd9d49,Gene expression profiles in peripheral lymphocytes by arsenic exposure and skin lesion status in a Bangladeshi population.,"Millions of individuals worldwide are chronically exposed to arsenic through their drinking water. In this study, the effect of arsenic exposure and arsenical skin lesion status on genome-wide gene expression patterns was evaluated using RNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of individuals selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study. Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) arrays were used to measure the expression of approximately 22,000 transcripts. Our primary statistical analysis involved identifying differentially expressed genes between participants with and without arsenical skin lesions based on the significance analysis of microarrays statistic with an a priori defined 1% false discovery rate to minimize false positives. To better characterize differential expression, we also conducted Gene Ontology and pathway comparisons in addition to the gene-specific analyses. Four-hundred sixty-eight genes were differentially expressed between these two groups, from which 312 differentially expressed genes were identified by restricting the analysis to female never-smokers. We also explored possible differential gene expression by arsenic exposure levels among individuals without manifest arsenical skin lesions; however, no differentially expressed genes could be identified from this comparison. Our findings show that microarray-based gene expression analysis is a powerful method to characterize the molecular profile of arsenic exposure and arsenic-induced diseases. Genes identified from this analysis may provide insights into the underlying processes of arsenic-induced disease and represent potential targets for chemoprevention studies to reduce arsenic-induced skin cancer in this population.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Maria Argos"", ids = ""3908803""); list(name = ""Muhammad G Kibriya"", ids = ""6280640""); list(name = ""Faruque Parvez"", ids = ""4371345""); list(name = ""F.

Animals were genotyped for 198 microsatellite markers that spanned the entire porcine genome. QTL analysis was conducted to extract information from paternal and maternal meioses separately using a rank-based nonparametric approach for half-sib designs. Nine QTL exceeded genome-wide significance: one QTL affecting growth (average daily gain on SSC1), two QTL influencing carcass composition (fatness on SSC3 and muscle mass on SSC15) and six QTL influencing meat quality (tenderness on SSC4 and SSC14; colour on SSC5, SSC6 and SSCX; and conductivity on SSC16). All but one of these coincided with previously reported QTL.

Characterization of genome-wide transcriptional changes in liver and adipose tissues of ZDF (fa/fa) rats fed R-lipoic acid by next-generation sequencing. Physiol Genomics 45: 1136â€“1143, 2013. First published October 8, 2013; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00138.2013.â€”We report on the characterization of lipogenic tissue transcriptional networks that support physiological responses of obese rats to a lipid-lowering bioactive food compound, R-lipoic acid (LA). Nine-week-old male Zucker diabetic fatty (fa/fa) rats were fed a chow diet supplemented with 3 g LA per kg diet or pair fed for 2 wk. At the end of the trial, high-quality RNA was extracted from the liver and epididymal fat and subjected to transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Results showed a substantially higher number of differentially expressed genes [DEG, false discovery rate adjusted P 0.05 and absolute log2 (fold change) 1] in the liver (110 genes) vs. epididymal fat (10 genes). Most epididymal fat DEG were also differentially expressed in liver and shared directionality of change. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these transcripts revealed significant enrichment of GO categories related to immune response, stress response, lipid metabolism, and carboxylic acid metabolic processes. Of interest, interferonrelated genes involved in defense against microorganisms and innate immune response were induced by LA. Lipid metabolism-related transcript changes observed in LA-fed animals included downregulation of lipogenic genes (Pnpla3, Pnpla5, Elovl6, Acly, Gpam, and Aacs) and concomitant upregulation of short-, medium-, and longchain fatty acid metabolic processes (Acot1, Acot2, Acsf2, and Crat). Transcriptional changes were accompanied by the lowering of abdominal adiposity and blood triacylglycerol levels. We conclude that LA dietary supplementation induces prominent gene expression changes in liver in support of significant improvement of whole-body lipid status.",2013,,"list(name = ""Anjeza Pashaj"", ids = ""4972671""); list(name = ""Xiaohua Yi"", ids = ""48674633""); list(name = ""Mengna Xia"", ids = ""4460833""); list(name = ""Stephanie A.

9b95484f189cd27035ba7326783251459dd76487,Single feature polymorphism detection using recombinant inbred line microarray expression data,"MOTIVATION
The Affymetrix GeneChip microarray is currently providing a high-density and economical platform for discovery of genetic polymorphisms. Microarray data for single feature polymorphism (SFP) detection in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) can capitalize on the high level of replication available for each locus in the RIL population. It was suggested that the binding affinities from all of the RILs would form a multimodal distribution for a SFP. This motivated us to estimate the binding affinities from the robust multi-array analysis (RMA) method and formulate the SFP detection problem as a hypothesis testing problem, i.e. testing whether the underlying distribution of the estimated binding affinity (EBA) values of a probe is unimodal or multimodal.


RESULTS
We developed a bootstrap-based hypothesis testing procedure using the 'dip' statistic. Our simulation studies show that the proposed procedure can reach satisfactory detection power with false discovery rate controlled at a desired level and is robust to the unimodal distribution assumption, which facilitates wide application of the proposed procedure. Our analysis of the real data identified more than four times the SFPs compared to the previous studies, covering 96% of their findings. The constructed genetic map using the SFP markers predicted from our procedure shows over 99% concordance of the genetic orders of these markers with their known physical locations on the genome sequence.

ad9891af89b261f78882adeb767c3e1c2d71ed4a,Comorbid anxiety and social avoidance in treatment of severe childhood aggression: response to adding risperidone to stimulant and parent training; mediation of disruptive symptom response.,"OBJECTIVE
In the four-site Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) study, addition of risperidone to stimulant and parent training moderately improved parent-rated disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) symptoms. This secondary study explores outcomes other than DBD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as measured by the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R (CASI-4R).


METHODS
A total of 168 children ages 6-12 with severe aggression (physical harm), DBD, and ADHD were randomized to parent training plus stimulant plus placebo (basic treatment) or parent training plus stimulant plus risperidone (augmented treatment) for 9 weeks. All received only parent training plus stimulant for the first 3 weeks, then those with room for improvement received a second drug (placebo or risperidone) for 6 weeks. CASI-4R category item means at baseline and week 9 were entered into linear mixed-effects models for repeated measures to evaluate group differences in changes. Mediation of the primary DBD outcome was explored.


RESULTS
Parent ratings were nonsignificant with small/negligible effects, but teacher ratings (n=46 with complete data) showed significant augmented treatment advantage for symptoms of anxiety (p=0.013, d=0.71), schizophrenia spectrum (p=0.017, d=0.45), and impairment in these domains (p=0.02, d=0.26), all remaining significant after false discovery rate correction for multiple tests. Improvement in teacher-rated anxiety significantly (p=0.001) mediated the effect of risperidone augmentation on the primary outcome, the Disruptive-total of the parent-rated Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form.


CONCLUSIONS
Addition of risperidone to parent training plus stimulant improves not only parent-rated DBD as previously reported, but also teacher-rated anxiety-social avoidance. Improvement in anxiety mediates improvement in DBD, suggesting anxiety-driven fight-or-flight disruptive behavior with aggression, with implications for potential treatment strategies. Clinicians should attend to possible anxiety in children presenting with aggression and DBD.

c4ff6ef4c492dce0ca6a18e03351c91fc2a2a461,Surrogate variable analysis using partial least squares (SVA-PLS) in gene expression studies,"MOTIVATION
In a typical gene expression profiling study, our prime objective is to identify the genes that are differentially expressed between the samples from two different tissue types. Commonly, standard analysis of variance (ANOVA)/regression is implemented to identify the relative effects of these genes over the two types of samples from their respective arrays of expression levels. But, this technique becomes fundamentally flawed when there are unaccounted sources of variability in these arrays (latent variables attributable to different biological, environmental or other factors relevant in the context). These factors distort the true picture of differential gene expression between the two tissue types and introduce spurious signals of expression heterogeneity. As a result, many genes which are actually differentially expressed are not detected, whereas many others are falsely identified as positives. Moreover, these distortions can be different for different genes. Thus, it is also not possible to get rid of these variations by simple array normalizations. This both-way error can lead to a serious loss in sensitivity and specificity, thereby causing a severe inefficiency in the underlying multiple testing problem. In this work, we attempt to identify the hidden effects of the underlying latent factors in a gene expression profiling study by partial least squares (PLS) and apply ANCOVA technique with the PLS-identified signatures of these hidden effects as covariates, in order to identify the genes that are truly differentially expressed between the two concerned tissue types.


RESULTS
We compare the performance of our method SVA-PLS with standard ANOVA and a relatively recent technique of surrogate variable analysis (SVA), on a wide variety of simulation settings (incorporating different effects of the hidden variable, under situations with varying signal intensities and gene groupings). In all settings, our method yields the highest sensitivity while maintaining relatively reasonable values for the specificity, false discovery rate and false non-discovery rate. Application of our method to gene expression profiling for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia shows that our method detects an additional six genes, that are missed by both the standard ANOVA method as well as SVA, but may be relevant to this disease, as can be seen from mining the existing literature.",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sutirtha Chakraborty"", ids = ""145352099""); list(name = ""Somnath Datta"", ids = ""22482203""); list(name = ""Susmita Datta"", ids = ""7137381"")",f7875c4c0c9568262e17eb797d8ad18ad8a60b95; a2ae44f0eb821e1cde87cb4a2e62ff4531fc602f; d395a9b963fe1f4be1bc13e1101df6a9746684fb; 05645506c2e35bb37d2fc383427b1a54fa14a330; 2b3558c343ea99b5a5786b96d7d77ae8a587990c; 37221c0a78edccc7c24add1dc6c8f590e26b9a0a; 96bb0ddadcc056099d97b773f03c8dd129c2eb22; 49d0188824e46381b940f5c6c6bc051a35728bbc; 0ad5ee282aa49da2e0bb647d3b99b9b48b235de3; e6d14bc16ed66252e91aa2a42d8f7aa8ebfd8575; 48f798773b61f6e399a3cbec55f59d60876a3672; 2d7fc097d5dceabe9b0a57d8fea320f0d497aea0; 98c633e91d0f403d4a1582b1d1a84b1fc70730de; 982f129b303fb0df3b5381f7987f0a7a931f587b; 788cb12f2c088ba3a02d9272950ad511327f6d16; 8aea88c3be65e102416ad9356912bde3efd654e5; 70d7dc4fb0a0e40ef1d14c1274400e1aa152ea16; 0ede935f7f6f56a0128465599befb6cf2bf6d9bc; 608644f3b1f3664a4f5d42112716fce7db1fc9e7; 8a337c714b4dd82e6d12db33b1ad0cfcac454b65; 860f8faf06d4fa634fcf9ee5747516fd5d6aaefc; 1a611e689cc9bf376636f03d03f42b4c7876db08; dc582bb632cee1115b7c52033602a3b4542d8884; eedc4840432dbec4cdf762a47effdd93a5cf4b77; feee74526b31af8a040b21a17bd38d8826dd14b8; 2a38c1c1a6294a883f7d65922a375036986031dd; 93e60a9eae737c07eb1d0c2c81109da8ef561127; b4e4a99fbbd2500cefcb687675adc60a77cac000; 7c3bee580c0fe10ce0abbe76c86e689120f54e00; 6529ac0f05fa22958f3edf728d5c72a63bfc58e7; 4b1faddaa8a65104fdc79ac00679530a0aabb474; a6e661bd58c8a862a810e3f3aa450340f5b256cc,c54a2fdd15c264e418c09b7c32bfc9725a5fbad6; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 5983a1a622627b57b3d0b142bfed379ab1f8065d; 42fe41e7d4bea87874afca2f75dcfd0ea537a429; e908660e625ebeb52149ac3aaf3897f17895cb9c; f33804058a856da28b99c06d1c661ac6c875af0c; 11c9d1e0f409f566dd321e34cffb3fd1ee51bac6; 3b729a59828caafe864e7cf4961952494b059268; 391e9281618610426b9fb406a2d611cca0b5a200; c9137821bae045088352744237ac02fedeb92311; 4d4b889b9244d391152a4aafe8f41e2bad302b88; a0870cab44f5b95975f61c483f31aff135d6c8b3; 1fc433cab5b2788369a41fcfd399997ce7df7b05; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; 4dd4734464529d7b10787b32410f6312ae28fd8b; 18f05331d8438caef8ff228c427d866e04f9b485; 9b78873c819f97fc4a7218dec9b328918e5a1bc6; d0d3598f6c8ceda3e0a14cb6228d1489b5212e0f; 65c4f601132902530ff0217b21e321e9c7e7812a; 26c8addc6e44a07fb9e9182a2dfc2154a0a5c256; d44d0b3a6766c32a8061c85af784ea5d79588950; 3f2dba88fc4c67f8fee376fdf365955cfd7a01ff; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 149dd5bf4a08c0443a72c18c48edcd385c3cbcb4; a0fe9ca8901bb390d5abfa3be41938a81e14bead; e6be2250d5b9d4a1671ec2259f97b5aae23be037; f3464c1e3911593ff53bd822e9fed07ae6093695; 2b1943a8f66717928a0820bec08def17c8cecf3c; 6ac34ce8d23e1615bd9e51c562bc756f0507adf3; 50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106; e64507b452b1e5bd1831340e9af6e46b27000273; 935725e04dd8f4c7f7ba6a7d909effa3c549170a; ccea618f9a2851e33398de395c4fc27d2ef982aa; ba0d3f2c8b863d0e8fd3c706ccda98a958940441; a41271519c02f93f7cb31005b7f9019f0f1f196e,Bioinformatics,28 6,"

45b42106ed4bc8e5c491c3acfcbc8081f88bbaf7,A data-driven approach for processing heterogeneous categorical sensor signals,"False alarms generated by sensors pose a substantial problem to a variety of fusion applications. We focus on situations where the frequency of a genuine alarm is ""rare"" but the false alarm rate is high. The goal is to mitigate the false alarms while retaining power to detect true events. We propose to utilize data streams contaminated by false alarms (generated in the field) to compute statistics on a single sensor's misclassification rate. The nominal misclassification rate of a deployed sensor is often suspect because it is unlikely that these rates were tuned to the specific environmental conditions in which the sensor was deployed. Recent categorical measurement error methods will be applied to the collection of data streams to ""train"" the sensors and provide point estimates along with confidence intervals for the parameters characterizing sensor performance. By pooling a relatively small collection of random variables arising from a single sensor and using data-driven misclassification rate estimates along with estimated confidence bands, we show how one can transform the stream of categorical random variables into a test statistic with a limiting standard normal distribution. The procedure shows promise for normalizing sequences of misclassified random variables coming from different sensors (with a priori unknown population parameters) to comparable test statistics; this facilitates fusion through various downstream processing mechanisms. We have explored some possible downstream processing mechanisms that rely on false discovery rate (FDR) methods. The FDR methods exploit the test statistics we have computed in a chemical sensor fusion context where reducing false alarms and maintaining substantial power is important. FDR methods also provide a framework to fuse signals coming from non-chem/bio sensors in order to improve performance. Simulation results illustrating these ideas are presented. Extensions, future work and open problems are also briefly discussed.",2011,Computer Science; Engineering,"list(name = ""Christopher P.

We investigated the effects of periodontal therapy on gene expression of peripheral blood monocytes.


METHODS
Fifteen patients with periodontitis gave blood samples at four time points: 1 week before periodontal treatment (#1), at treatment initiation (baseline, #2), 6-week (#3) and 10-week post-baseline (#4). At baseline and 10 weeks, periodontal status was recorded and subgingival plaque samples were obtained. Periodontal therapy (periodontal surgery and extractions without adjunctive antibiotics) was completed within 6 weeks. At each time point, serum concentrations of 19 biomarkers were determined. Peripheral blood monocytes were purified, RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labelled and hybridized with AffymetrixU133Plus2.0 chips. Expression profiles were analysed using linear random-effects models. Further analysis of gene ontology terms summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. Differential expression of selected genes was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in a subset of patients.


RESULTS
Treatment resulted in a substantial improvement in clinical periodontal status and reduction in the levels of several periodontal pathogens. Expression profiling over time revealed more than 11,000 probe sets differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of <0.05. Approximately 1/3 of the patients showed substantial changes in expression in genes relevant to innate immunity, apoptosis and cell signalling.


CONCLUSIONS

9e3ab99a0e1285ea84d6fe6d6a1e3b3726285d41,Microbiome Composition by Pyrosequencing in Mesenteric Lymph Nodes of Rats with CCl4-Induced Cirrhosis,"Background: The cross talk between the gut microbiota and the immune system, which is essential to maintain homeostasis, takes place at the intestinal lymphoid tissue such as the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Here, we investigated the presence of bacterial DNA in MLNs of control and cirrhotic rats and its relationship with inflammatory responses. Methods: The MLN microbiome of cirrhotic rats with ascites, which was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), was compared to that of control rats using quantitative real-time PCR and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Cytokines in blood samples were assessed by ELISA. Results: Unexpectedly, sequence analysis revealed a high microbial diversity in the MLNs of both control and cirrhotic rats with Proteobacteria as one of the most dominant phylum. CCl4-induced liver injury was not associated with a change in bacterial load, but it was linked to a decrease in microbial diversity (p < 0.05) and alterations in the microbial community in MLNs. A high proportion of Bifidobacterium animalis was also positively correlated with elevated interleukin-10 expression (p = 0.002, false discovery rate = 0.03, r = 0.94). Conclusions: For the first time, the high microbial diversity observed in MLNs of both controls and CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats provides evidence that bacterial translocation is more than a mere dichotomic phenomenon.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Silvia MartÃ­nez Cuenca"", ids = ""152955555""); list(name = ""Elisabet SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""47081622""); list(name = ""Alba Santiago"", ids = ""2152442""); list(name = ""Ismail El khader"", ids = ""4515416""); list(name = ""Suchita Panda"", ids = ""4511969""); list(name = ""SÃ­lvia Vidal"", ids = ""3442411""); list(name = ""Juan Camilo Nieto"", ids = ""11758046""); list(name = ""CÃ¡ndido JuÃ¡rez"", ids = ""50606832""); list(name = ""Francesc HernÃ¡ndez Sancho"", ids = ""40409288""); list(name = ""Francisco Guarner"", ids = ""3744708""); list(name = ""GermÃ¡n Soriano"", ids = ""74269108""); list(name = ""Carlos Guarner"", ids = ""48893032""); list(name = ""Chaysavanh Manichanh"", ids = ""6643982"")",a1f37a570702f4c499dabc6f9160f35dffed3146; 7f74170e3d7390ba4a6ba7e333713294e3b010c8; ca32a8874954779f1df4e635f2794c66af4c2f8f; 3a4e797dac5d1288ea05a38b0511e0305ae34c2b; 4e0d5abf8bfd3fe651df7f243350cd0dfcf16db9; 1c9ef212ca1c1bb8b3b7bbe5d8bea29ee357106a; 473610ce208177ba4d0dfc0b823d5eb6244e91cc,17f50141796d4b74fa9c3a8c851a2bf10fc1ac67; 200cb57843557c82031c982e2f5b9e273d047d14; ff5adfc098173e214d4f72ad0185a71c8e9777a8; 3d35c3cc583ba7577da2702a3d348855a1d4ac21; bba358ee5f1995184c84e5b9d5f29e8e4c20ab2e; a3e6c119208a30fc0516b2bfb774e8533209da57; 2d49ddf180b00111a96c5030748315cb6677f72b; 4da27cd0db58cf6d8525a06dd5def1584acb0de8; da176486f8c64b66dc16b5294ced6f8f2237f55c; 3b5b29a97031fcbed3c04f3a6b52ea053fb93e26; 7045ef1a5a3efa9882dbdd18b92c8001b2c69296; 6013de7e8e237bf1f96ec32677a5f1f0b46f84db; 70553b6283f5be005769a04fbf37e0564a0c599e; d5f7606479dcda1cb3ca0e38209f00f8bfbae298; 508910619c9e9d30d02c0524168d9363a80e02dd; ba859850ee64cad89d3318ac9c40762e2af45385; ac0cb2c438aa0344a6cd93300d94c704945b5f35; b28d82ebdf643add67f9eb4ef7a6ffa10bbf0731; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; bd5d3fde2775bb50441f96285329b9b4c1d3135c; 4633e8472ce862dee7e9ab862ac86c341113cf90; 8a740fbf651377eb3b3d4f2c62c6ca7fd5a53fe3; fb08ea225961b200cce8fd6fe23d86bf7b61cd90; 934665e594c4ca57f95f0ef2b1b7462558fd943b; 68afe48d1d0734e59e6dad03693ca4b7110eb29d; 16bdd6e7c7ad5372d27abd32bbec810c3815b8c8; ad96b1d1d28ca1e8c241194990183eeb9def1698; bb845e3022545f10577683947190540e6ac0354f; 8861e3d497b2da8659738c58d83e0f0856a9700c; faa9d222535038e575be735d1fc74bce950554b8; 9de1b8ca3ca3c4f9e8ab23cfa272858b849104d5; fbbbe0b7e50008cc0bc32f73a90e65bc357c8325; ff288d28efeb4c9b62f8b89bc9c9cf55286c91bc; 2579d6e1744880b9485283a4ba0a40522edf0d3b; 409d45bb597979ee747cd9d49a2cfdd6de8ba37e; dc9dafc09ea54ad29c9f9e1b20b2cff7ba373e8b; bee63388589d4b36ccf64775ed8c0a0703e1d5e4; dda5d7aa4d56676c15c71cebcc10066959b2811f; c5154754e3e09039272a7ed09439834c21df6e59; a3704c1edad38feaf66481adb6ae8255adfa3e0b; ccb1a852d9d89775474668965ed9f269705df50e,Journal of Innate Immunity,6,263 - 271

There is substantial imaging evidence for volumetric abnormalities of the amygdala in younger children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The amygdala can be divided into functionally distinct laterobasal, superficial, and centromedial subregions. To date, we are not aware of any in vivo reports specifically assessing subregional amygdalar abnormalities in individuals with ASD.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate alterations in subregional amygdalar morphology in children with ASD compared with typically developing (TD) children and to examine the relationships with ASD symptom severity.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional study encompassing a narrow age range of children with ASD and age-matched TD children that evaluated magnetic resonance imaging-defined subregional morphology of the amygdala using a novel subregional analytic method.


SETTING
Participants were recruited and clinically evaluated through the University of Washington Autism Center and imaged at the Diagnostic Imaging Sciences Center at the University of Washington. Imaging data were analyzed through the Brain Imaging Laboratory at the Seoul National University.


PARTICIPANTS
Fifty-one children 6 to 7 years of age (ASD, n = 31 and TD, n = 20) were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral measures.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Volume and subregional measures of the amygdala and measures of social and communication functioning.


RESULTS
The ASD group exhibited larger right and left amygdalae, by 12.7% and 11.0%, respectively, relative to the TD group. Subregional analysis revealed that the ASD group had enlarged laterobasal amygdalar subregions, relative to the TD group, after adjusting for age, sex, and hemispheric cerebral volume (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected and with clustered surface points >15). Exploratory analyses revealed that there were linear trends comparing a strictly defined subgroup of children with autistic disorder, who exhibited the greatest extent of laterobasal enlargement, followed by a subgroup of children with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and then the group of TD children (P for linear trend <.001). There were linear trends between enlargement of laterobasal subregions and lower levels of social and communication functioning (P < .001, P < .001, and P = .001 for 3 areas in the right laterobasal subregion; P < .001 for 1 area in the left laterobasal subregion).


CONCLUSION
The current study demonstrates bilateral enlargement of laterobasal subregions of the amygdala in 6- to 7-year-old children with ASD and that subregional alterations are associated with deficits in social and communicative behavior.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jieun E.

845e979d52f1c8f99774a8006b5d35d83afb8393,Efficient screening of predictive biomarkers for individual treatment selection.,"The development of molecular diagnostic tools to achieve individualized medicine requires identifying predictive biomarkers associated with subgroups of individuals who might receive beneficial or harmful effects from different available treatments. However, due to the large number of candidate biomarkers in the large-scale genetic and molecular studies, and complex relationships among clinical outcome, biomarkers and treatments, the ordinary statistical tests for the interactions between treatments and covariates have difficulties from their limited statistical powers. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for detecting predictive biomarkers. We employ weighted loss functions of Chen etÂ al. (2017) to directly estimate individual treatment scores and propose synthetic posterior inference for effect sizes of biomarkers. We develop an empirical Bayes approach, namely, we estimate unknown hyperparameters in the prior distribution based on data. We then provide efficient screening methods for the candidate biomarkers via optimal discovery procedure with adequate control of false discovery rate. The proposed method is demonstrated in simulation studies and an application to a breast cancer clinical study in which the proposed method was shown to detect the much larger numbers of significant biomarkers than existing standardÂ methods.

fe0ee4d6ac7ea24828b052b83411cd7edc933900,Differential gene expression profiling of gastric intraepithelial neoplasia and early-stage adenocarcinoma.,"AIM
To investigate the differentiated whole genome expression profiling of gastric high- and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and early-stage adenocarcinoma.


METHODS
Gastric specimens from an upper magnifying chromoendoscopic targeted biopsy were collected from March 2010 to May 2013. Whole genome expression profiling was performed on 19 low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), 20 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), 19 early-stage adenocarcinoma (EGC), and 19 chronic gastritis tissue samples using Agilent 4 Ã— 44K Whole Human Genome microarrays. Differentially expressed genes between different types of lesions were identified using an unpaired t-test and corrected with the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate algorithm. A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed using the GeneSpring software GX 12.6. The differentially expressed gene was verified using a real-time TaqManÂ® PCR assay with independent tissue samples, including 26 LGIN, 15 HGIN, 14 EGC, and 20 chronic gastritis. The expression of G0S2 were further validated by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) in 24 LGIN, 40 HGIN, 30 EGC and 61 chronic gastritis specimens.


RESULTS
The gene expression patterns of LGIN and HGIN tissues were distinct. There were 2521 significantly differentially expressed transcripts in HGIN, with 951 upregulated and 1570 downregulated. A GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the most striking overexpressed transcripts in HGIN compared with LGIN were in the category of metabolism, defense response, and nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) cascade. While the vast majority of transcripts had barely altered expression in HGIN and EGC tissues, only 38 transcripts were upregulated in EGC. A GO enrichment analysis revealed that the alterations of the immune response were most prominent in the progression from HGIN to EGC. It is worth noting that, compared with LGIN, 289 transcripts were expressed at higher levels both in HGIN and EGC. A characteristic gene, G0/G1 switch 2 (G0S2) was one of the 289 transcripts and related to metabolism, the immune response, and the NF-ÎºB cascade, and its expression was validated in independent samples through real-time TaqManÂ® PCR and immunohistochemical staining. In real-time PCR analysis, the expression of G0S2 was elevated both in HGIN and EGC compared with that in LGIN (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). In IHC analysis, G0S2 immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasmic of neoplastic cells, but was undetectable in chronic gastritis cells. The G0S2 expression in HGIN was higher than that of LGIN (P = 0.012, Ï‡ (2) = 6.28) and EGC (P = 0.008, Ï‡ (2) = 6.94).


CONCLUSION
A clear biological distinction between gastric high- and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was identified, and provides molecular evidence for clinical application.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xue Xu"", ids = ""36473807""); list(name = ""Lin Feng"", ids = ""47010087""); list(name = ""Yu Liu"", ids = ""38057162""); list(name = ""Weixun Zhou"", ids = ""3759478""); list(name = ""Ying-Cai Ma"", ids = ""47009821""); list(name = ""Gui-jun Fei"", ids = ""4870016""); list(name = ""Ning An"", ids = ""84146507""); list(name = ""Yuan Li"", ids = ""47002305""); list(name = ""Xi Wu"", ids = ""48662079""); list(name = ""Fang Yao"", ids = ""144927215""); list(name = ""Shu-jun Cheng"", ids = ""6624062""); list(name = ""Xing-Hua Lu"", ids = ""7828832"")",68185bceeb4cd708b2ce1c712aad7cce810670b6; 1950f04e833cce1bb552fb22d0b166b53d5f33cd; 1f32312c2b56ffc5960be23339c5fda4cd02b4ff; 2309f3df5b4b3b3c0632c956234349d51c910c29,,World journal of gastroenterology,20 47,"

9794da6116318056bf873cc881572f281316f2f4,Human Lung DNA Methylation Quantitative Trait Loci Colocalize with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Genomeâ€Wide Association Loci,"Rationale: As the third leading cause of death in the United States, the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) makes identification of its molecular mechanisms of great importance. Genomeâ€wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple genomic regions associated with COPD. However, genetic variation only explains a small fraction of the susceptibility to COPD, and subâ€genomeâ€wide significant loci may play a role in pathogenesis. Objectives: Regulatory annotation with epigenetic evidence may give priority for further investigation, particularly for GWAS associations in noncoding regions. We performed integrative genomics analyses using DNA methylation profiling and genomeâ€wide SNP genotyping from lung tissue samples from 90 subjects with COPD and 36 control subjects. Methods: We performed methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) analyses, testing for SNPs associated with percent DNA methylation and assessed the colocalization of these results with previous COPD GWAS findings using Bayesian methods in the R package coloc to highlight potential regulatory features of the loci. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 942,068 unique SNPs and 33,996 unique CpG sites among the significant (5% false discovery rate) cisâ€mQTL results. The genomeâ€wide significant and subthreshold (P < 10âˆ’4) GWAS SNPs were enriched in the significant mQTL SNPs (hypergeometric test P < 0.00001). We observed enrichment for sites located in CpG shores and shelves, but not CpG islands. Using Bayesian colocalization, we identified loci in regions near KCNK3, EEFSEC, PIK3CD, DCDC2C, TCERG1L, FRMD4B, and IL27. Conclusions: Colocalization of mQTL and GWAS loci provides regulatory characterization of significant and subthreshold GWAS findings, supporting a role for genetic control of methylation in COPD pathogenesis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jarrett D Morrow"", ids = ""39287671""); list(name = ""Kimberly Glass"", ids = ""1953574""); list(name = ""Michael H.

82d7a2b4edd447f7091d0d17bfa83fd1951cf50b,Quantification of Craniofacial Growth in Mice with Craniofacial Dysmorphology Caused by the Crouzon Mutation Fgfr2C342Y,"The Crouzon syndrome is characterised by growth disturbances caused by premature fusion of the cranial growth zones (craniosynostosis). A mouse model with mutation Fgfr2C342Y , equivalent to the most common Crouzon syndrome mutation, has a phenotype showing many parallels to the human counterpart. Quantifying growth in the Crouzon mouse model could test hypotheses of the relationship between craniosynostosis and dysmorphology (abnormal morphology) and thus lead to better understanding of the causes of Crouzon syndrome as well as providing knowledge relevant for surgery planning in humans in the future. The present thesis extends the work of Hildur Olafsdottir who worked on quantifying differences between normal and Crouzon mice in her Ph.D. thesis. Automatic non-rigid volumetric image registration was applied to micro CT scans of ten 4-week and twenty 6-week euthanized mice for growth modeling. Each age group consisted of 50% normal (wild-type) and 50% Crouzon mice. Four 3D mean shapes (atlases), one for each mouse-type and age group were created. Extracting a dense field of growth vectors for each mouse-type; growth models were created using linear interpolation. Visualisations in the form of 3D animations where made. Spatial regions of significantly different growth were identified using the local False Discovery Rate method (FDR), which estimates the expected percentage of false predictions in a set of predictions, and a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), which unlike local FDR incorporated the correlation between the x, y and z component of the growth vector. Additionally, after automatically locating anatomical landmarks; growth was estimated automatically for clinical interesting variables such as skull length, width and height. Furthermore, significant growth differences were found between Crouzon and normal mice, as well as significant differences in spatial distribution of growth. The work was extended to include an estimation of the change in asymmetry between 4 and 6-week. The reason for this was the hypothesis, that the Crouzon mice would develop a higher degree of asymmetry during growth. Thus, asymmetry analysis is a natural continuation of growth modeling.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Signe S.

In this thesis, I utilized the cutting-edge technology of single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) to assess the presence of somatic copy number variations (CNVs) throughout cerebral cortical development. I developed and thoroughly validated a robust CNV detection pipeline. This included the use of support vector machine learning algorithms trained on lymphocyte V(D)J recombination to model high quality CNV calls. My approach reduced false discovery rate (FDR) by 91% and identified thousands of somatic CNVs in the cerebral cortexâ€”with 51% under 1 Mb. Analysis of ~400 cells revealed that CNVs are present throughout the genome of individual brain cells and exhibit a strong preference for deletions over amplifications. Importantly, CNV frequency triples from early- to mid-neurogenesis, which may suggest a prenatal origin of CNV diversity. Expanding upon this baseline has indicated that the incidence of somatic CNVs, particularly amplification events, is altered by fetal exposure to ethanol. I anticipate my work will inspire targeted research that will provide further insight into the importance of neuronal SGM in both healthy and diseased brains.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Suzanne Rohrback"", ids = ""4428153"")",,,,,
d019031a9a7e36cadb9ddad768599cecfdfbd731,Susceptibility of Weedy Hosts from Pacific Northwest Potato Production Systems to Crop-Aggressive Isolates of Verticillium dahliae.,"Verticillium wilt, caused by Verticillium dahliae, is a disease of dicotyledonous crops such as potato and has a wide host range and persistent, long-term survival structures called microsclerotia that can persist in soil for up to 14 years. Some V. dahliae isolates are particularly aggressive on a specific plant host while retaining the ability to infect a wide range of other hosts. Weeds can serve as hosts for V. dahliae but whether they serve as sources of inoculum for aggressive isolates of V. dahliae to crop hosts is unknown. The goal of this research was to quantify V. dahliae microsclerotia obtained from 16 weeds which were grown in the greenhouse. Potting medium was infested with one of eight V. dahliae isolates from potato, mint, sugar beet, sunflower, tomato, and watermelon. The isolates from mint and potato were aggressive on the host from which they were originally isolated. All 16 weeds were infected by at least one V. dahliae isolate, although the number of microsclerotia produced from some infections was relatively low (â‰¤5 microsclerotia/g of dry plant). Black nightshade yielded greater numbers of microsclerotia of the V. dahliae potato isolate than any other isolate in three of four trials in the greenhouse (second trial false discovery rate, adjusted P â‰¤ 0.0158; third trial, P â‰¤ 0.0264; and fourth trial, P â‰¤ 0.0193). Litchi tomato yielded greater numbers of microsclerotia of the V. dahliae potato isolate than any other isolate in one of four trials (first trial, P â‰¤ 0.0149). A V. dahliae isolate from tomato yielded greater numbers of microsclerotia in large crabgrass and wild oat in a second trial (P â‰¤ 0.0158). Weeds, depending on the species, grown during and between potato crop rotations may increase the number of microsclerotia of the potato-aggressive isolates of V. dahliae.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Z.

5d0f866e8cb9971abe59296fe7bb2b8889210f1e,Calibrating the Performance of SNP Arrays for Whole-Genome Association Studies,"To facilitate whole-genome association studies (WGAS), several high-density SNP genotyping arrays have been developed. Genetic coverage and statistical power are the primary benchmark metrics in evaluating the performance of SNP arrays. Ideally, such evaluations would be done on a SNP set and a cohort of individuals that are both independently sampled from the original SNPs and individuals used in developing the arrays. Without utilization of an independent test set, previous estimates of genetic coverage and statistical power may be subject to an overfitting bias. Additionally, the SNP arrays' statistical power in WGAS has not been systematically assessed on real traits. One robust setting for doing so is to evaluate statistical power on thousands of traits measured from a single set of individuals. In this study, 359 newly sampled Americans of European descent were genotyped using both Affymetrix 500K (Affx500K) and Illumina 650Y (Ilmn650K) SNP arrays. From these data, we were able to obtain estimates of genetic coverage, which are robust to overfitting, by constructing an independent test set from among these genotypes and individuals. Furthermore, we collected liver tissue RNA from the participants and profiled these samples on a comprehensive gene expression microarray. The RNA levels were used as a large-scale set of quantitative traits to calibrate the relative statistical power of the commercial arrays. Our genetic coverage estimates are lower than previous reports, providing evidence that previous estimates may be inflated due to overfitting. The Ilmn650K platform showed reasonable power (50% or greater) to detect SNPs associated with quantitative traits when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is greater than or equal to 0.5 and the causal SNP's minor allele frequency (MAF) is greater than or equal to 20% (N = 359). In testing each of the more than 40,000 gene expression traits for association to each of the SNPs on the Ilmn650K and Affx500K arrays, we found that the Ilmn650K yielded 15% times more discoveries than the Affx500K at the same false discovery rate (FDR) level.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ke Hao"", ids = ""143928258""); list(name = ""Eric E.

 (SI) is an important trait of Citrus plants that is exploited by farmers to produce seedless fruit. However, the molecular mechanism of SI in Citrus is not well understood. Wuzishatangju (Citrus reticulata Blanco) (SI) is an excellent seedless cultivar selected from a seedy Shatangju cultivar (self-compatible, SC) through spontaneous bud mutation. The two cultivars are therefore excellent materials for studying the mechanisms of SI and/or SC in Citrus. In this study, an integrative strategy combining eight suppression subtractive hybridization libraries with cDNA microarray was used to study the molecular mechanisms that differ between Wuzishatangju and Shatangju (control) mandarins. A custom microarray screen resulted in a total of 1,830 up- or down-regulated clones (false discovery rate <0.05 and a fold change $${ \geqq }$$â‰§2) obtained from 9,810 positive clones. The expression of genes involved in embryonic development, ubiquitination pathway, Ca2+-signaling pathway, gibberellins, and auxin was significantly up-regulated in SI Wuzishatangju compared with SC Shatangju mandarin. The microarray analysis suggested that the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway might be involved in the SI reaction of Wuzishatangju. Additionally, our research highlighted some main genes (mitogen-activated protein kinase, SI S1 family protein, ubiquitin-conjugating factor E4-like, auxin transporter protein 1, and gibberellin receptor) that participate in the SI reaction of Wuzishatangju and could be beneficial for understanding the evolution of SI systems and for breeding seedless citrus fruits in the future.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Hongxia Miao"", ids = ""47355788""); list(name = ""Zixing Ye"", ids = ""47051281""); list(name = ""Guibing Hu"", ids = ""7204044""); list(name = ""Yonghua Qin"", ids = ""51031036"")",6e40d97658284387d4dc109841272a85f271d657; 811e961a1d7ceb7b874cfadbf9136d877269a357; a664a670a9f81d4bfc5cca1c2d7e07762714d714; 3a4e04019e3e999beac151b3ffa937dfcdf618e6; 4d3000bb075239bac1001e4cfad528d1df823f58; bb037e732a09a11693e254a906b91f0633bffbcd,dea1593d239f62ced2f4dadeef22867afcef020f; d516d15ae4381098266b1b03ba53d5fcb45a8202; 20e50283ec533173b20c83e08633136ba940b724; e6519f02dba8016848b3b15d22b229118e33297b; c394239e2d28f7c78773f18f8e1c6ec12d26a0f4; 2c418abea66ce726e22e66e4f96590a56b909680; 6379e1ee51ba9ecdea9fba2f006cc447826c5ad3; c0c526d531b19ee330847309f5f19c7050aeb31c; 01c5212ef4986d4e95830892d7b996fe3646102f; 0ef1a484c4e356c5827e4710cdd78b69c7eea5e5; f73bf47cf381c683cde4fe83863b7bde0785352b; 3acfcaf4acdbb1ce242a7349d41135241162d043; 9157d0021df4fdfa4f647151a75687c1f52faf08; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; e343c35693244aa4f5cfdd5e592e76a8d3ae5c44; 6fa941e951a3f00a222757068b150b7a7e610f7b; 91a869ae1a10f985fe938c64a9f73932f1f91470; 206d057d6f7c94b817f39aa0080915b69c375fd5; b868f96a59ca7ca845926c5afd36306f151e7371; 5344fab634b835fb678177b6d2e4a7640a750b22; 73574ddee850d9d24d8bf259ddc78ab944772f9b; ff3470238c10b6b9446b75e3b591c48c023516d4; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 4a72a6d3df225c026ae467e7f6ea69cc0a617be1; 0943f2a6298bc45d6a307a5cae24c9c5cd9d52dd; cab49bfc0c8b7fdcfefcbdf4ea49e8b7c423fe9e; a0eaf3b0b0b8aba68043b6cd6b4f7aab1142dc5f; 29e848b0058ba7529b104add5187fa8e7c777f33; ae4197a01b01b6a021e767a07733f45fdf59f692; 0003f40e353d32c840dc5bad9eb60c8dc1b263d3; 510752b33e44e9aad2394f13191d8c3cd0bcb4f7; 923a34fc1c1e01ac250f998579a9cd6459aa3ab1; 789b4b1390b44aca1c44603cc1b38b98e6a08c42; dd22f8e1ecbb9a777222b32541174741e0ddcb9b; 3ee1c17176b83f40f50e2b2d9d5273f6d635d1e9; b2aebd4c2e73c0c4b9340b5461a3211e276db7a0; aa5d7624271bbc3ff3cdb0ae019e2c34508435b3; 45d2306a53f681a14f9dde5ed1c64d8173e873aa; e710209f59d19b42075ead1f3557c15a9e6e342a; 617112832177b37ef048b987d1b82ea6c394a707; 526318e44968d5245e9854bb93390aa06a3dbe4a; fb795678017f012ddd2f3e4659fa8ba59dd938b4; 003c86a15e11279141ea4670cbeee7356e9f4eaf; 0d1c5a706c943dc4fb647d0b04ae1dd0f47904fa; 4632712deab1bc33d064b2ad4e614f8ddb9f13a9; edf19d8f883e6bd02c6114aa4602fedeb5b8098c; 053596af150ed7f5eef435a0568d0adf920aa0d8; 360444e678365b80e2e9cdb668e3c06d44287ced,Molecular Breeding,35,1-15
6126c71aae9f1c0585b5ab370b21b529cb48382d,Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the setting of peripheral arterial disease,"BackgroundPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a relatively common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that leads to progressive narrowing of the lumen of leg arteries. Circulating monocytes are in contact with the arterial wall and can serve as reporters of vascular pathology in the setting of PAD. We performed gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with PAD and controls without PAD to identify differentially regulated genes.MethodsPAD was defined as an ankle brachial index (ABI) â‰¤0.9 (n = 19) while age and gender matched controls had an ABI > 1.0 (n = 18). Microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 gene chips and analyzed using GeneSpring GX 11.0. Gene expression data was normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) normalization method, differential expression was defined as a fold change â‰¥1.5, followed by unpaired Mann-Whitney test (P < 0.05) and correction for multiple testing by Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate. Meta-analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using an integrated bioinformatics pipeline with tools for enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathway analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), molecular event enrichment using Reactome annotations and network analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis suite. Extensive biocuration was also performed to understand the functional context of genes.ResultsWe identified 87 genes differentially expressed in the setting of PAD; 40 genes were upregulated and 47 genes were downregulated. We employed an integrated bioinformatics pipeline coupled with literature curation to characterize the functional coherence of differentially regulated genes.ConclusionNotably, upregulated genes mediate immune response, inflammation, apoptosis, stress response, phosphorylation, hemostasis, platelet activation and platelet aggregation. Downregulated genes included several genes from the zinc finger family that are involved in transcriptional regulation. These results provide insights into molecular mechanisms relevant to the pathophysiology of PAD.",2011,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Rizwan Masud"", ids = ""2275835""); list(name = ""Khader Shameer"", ids = ""47189518""); list(name = ""Aparna Dhar"", ids = ""48078607""); list(name = ""Keyue Ding"", ids = ""145545411""); list(name = ""Iftikhar J.

6b593445d74f756827015e3f77215279dda66142,Flagging clinical adverse experiences: reducing false discoveries without materially compromising power for detecting true signals.,"Comparative analyses of safety/tolerability data from a typical phase III randomized clinical trial generate multiple p-values associated with adverse experiences (AEs) across several body systems. A common approach is to 'flag' any AE with a p-value less than or equal to 0.05, ignoring the multiplicity problem. Despite the fact that this approach can result in excessive false discoveries (false positives), many researchers avoid a multiplicity adjustment to curtail the risk of missing true safety signals. We propose a new flagging mechanism that significantly lowers the false discovery rate (FDR) without materially compromising the power for detecting true signals, relative to the common no-adjustment approach. Our simple two-step procedure is an enhancement of the Mehrotra-Heyse-Tukey approach that leverages the natural grouping of AEs by body systems. We use simulations to show that, on the basis of FDR and power, our procedure is an attractive alternative to the following: (i) the no-adjustment approach; (ii) a one-step FDR approach that ignores the grouping of AEs by body systems; and (iii) a recently proposed two-step FDR approach for much larger-scale settings such as genome-wide association studies. We use three clinical trial examples for illustration.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Devan V.

7d8b6a913b1deb70f48876db483aef9c8b6daa40,RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome of the liver of cynomolgus monkeys with type 2 diabetes.,"Genetic and environmental factors such as high-fat diet are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Cynomolgus monkey shares similar genetic makeup, tissue structures, physiology and metabolic function to human. This study aimed to establish T2DM model in cynomolgus monkey and compare expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in normal cynomolgus monkeys and those with T2DM. We employed RNA-seq technique and identified 1451 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% between normal and T2DM animals. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were associated with 12 KEGG pathways (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). Two of these pathways were associated with metabolism and five were related to immunity. Unexpected, we found ECM-receptor interaction pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest that three major pathways may be implicated in the development of T2DM, including steroid biosynthesis, immune response and ECM. Further characterization of these pathways may provide new targets for the prevention and therapy of T2DM.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xinyu Li"", ids = ""48568996""); list(name = ""Zijing Lin"", ids = ""46268510""); list(name = ""Xiaorong Zhan"", ids = ""8343266""); list(name = ""Jie Gao"", ids = ""48441686""); list(name = ""Lijie Sun"", ids = ""49754947""); list(name = ""Yan Cao"", ids = ""47184343""); list(name = ""H.

17280ac0f539e18928897c7a496b459efd6d22b5,A Genome-Wide Association Study for Regulators of Micronucleus Formation in Mice,"In mammals the regulation of genomic instability plays a key role in tumor suppression and also controls genome plasticity, which is important for recombination during the processes of immunity and meiosis. Most studies to identify regulators of genomic instability have been performed in cells in culture or in systems that report on gross rearrangements of the genome, yet subtle differences in the level of genomic instability can contribute to whole organism phenotypes such as tumor predisposition. Here we performed a genome-wide association study in a population of 1379 outbred Crl:CFW(SW)-US_P08 mice to dissect the genetic landscape of micronucleus formation, a biomarker of chromosomal breaks, whole chromosome loss, and extranuclear DNA. Variation in micronucleus levels is a complex trait with a genome-wide heritability of 53.1%. We identify seven loci influencing micronucleus formation (false discovery rate <5%), and define candidate genes at each locus. Intriguingly at several loci we find evidence for sexual dimorphism in micronucleus formation, with a locus on chromosome 11 being specific to males.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebecca E.

8f145fe3c2ec17208861fb39df581765a4ee9fdd,"Accounting for multiplicity in the evaluation of ""signals"" obtained by data mining from spontaneous report adverse event databases.","Surveillance of drug products in the marketplace continues after approval, to identify rare potential toxicities that are unlikely to have been observed in the clinical trials carried out before approval. This surveillance accumulates large numbers of spontaneous reports of adverse events along with other information in spontaneous report databases. Recently developed empirical Bayes and Bayes methods provide a way to summarize the data in these databases, including a quantitative measure of the strength of the reporting association between the drugs and the events. Determining which of the particular drug-event associations, of which there may be many tens of thousands, are real reporting associations and which random noise presents a substantial problem of multiplicity because the resources available for medical and epidemiologic followup are limited. The issues are similar to those encountered with the evaluation of microarrays, but there are important differences. This report compares the application of a standard empirical Bayes approach with micorarray-inspired methods for controlling the False Discovery Rate, and a new Bayesian method for the resolution of the multiplicity problem to a relatively small database containing about 48,000 reports. The Bayesian approach appears to have attractive diagnostic properties in addition to being easy to interpret and implement computationally.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""A Lawrence Gould"", ids = ""144116033"")",3e7ad7d1079bb21634e809072e5dc3153485d1fd; ce96bb13c2eec47e375574709b38820c38bf9626; 7b59b9898d07b68e8d0147a2004a6433a536b25a; 90403e173232a084df9ea62cf94bf9af38132639; b1b08d3c00098cc58a78f7aa27cab577ca08443e; 32c5709a67799dc3e93ea6b0f4c1466eebdf2ec7; 954fb02e93714d2c051724bf0c44d83100264717; a1603b17fc5d5a130964fb81661ed1dca375c43f; 1b3d026ea39ba56556ccbd0ba575a4a57dd71588; d04c0b3e8bb7f33c9575c89f963f5c05eacf52c0; 8c3f9274939591ea957e4bac31e43cc67b918fbe,,Biometrical journal.

e51ceb333ea684b4ad8fce5437fb45c14eb3c90f,Lu-octreotate therapy for neuroendocrine tumours is enhanced by Hsp 90 inhibition,"177Lu-octreotate is an FDA-approved radionuclide therapy for patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) expressing somatostatin receptors. The 177Lu-octreotate therapy has shown promising results in clinical trials by prolonging progression-free survival, but complete responses are still uncommon. The aim of this study was to improve the 177Lu-octreotate therapy by means of combination therapy. To identify radiosensitising inhibitors, two cell lines, GOT1 and P-STS, derived from small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (SINETs), were screened with 1224 inhibitors alone or in combination with external radiation. The screening revealed that inhibitors of Hsp90 can potentiate the tumour cell-killing effect of radiation in a synergistic fashion (GOT1; false discovery rate <3.2 Ã— 10âˆ’11). The potential for Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib to enhance the anti-tumour effect of 177Lu-octreotate in an in vivo setting was studied in the somatostatin receptor-expressing GOT1 xenograft model. The combination led to a larger decrease in tumour volume relative to monotherapies and the tumour-reducing effect was shown to be synergistic. Using patient-derived tumour cells from eight metastatic SINETs, we could show that ganetespib enhanced the effect of 177Lu-octreotate therapy for all investigated patient tumours. Levels of Hsp90 protein expression were evaluated in 767 SINETs from 379 patients. We found that Hsp90 expression was upregulated in tumour cells relative to tumour stroma in the vast majority of SINETs. We conclude that Hsp90 inhibitors enhance the tumour-killing effect of 177Lu-octreotate therapy synergistically in SINET tumour models and suggest that this potentially promising combination should be further evaluated.

We aimed to investigate the prospective association between plasma metabolite concentrations and risk of prostate cancer overall, and by time to diagnosis and tumour characteristics, and risk of death from prostate cancer.MethodsIn a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, pre-diagnostic plasma concentrations of 122 metabolites (including acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, hexose and sphingolipids) were measured using targeted mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit) and compared between 1077 prostate cancer cases and 1077 matched controls. Risk of prostate cancer associated with metabolite concentrations was estimated by multi-variable conditional logistic regression, and multiple testing was accounted for by using a false discovery rate controlling procedure.ResultsSeven metabolite concentrations, i.e. acylcarnitine C18:1, amino acids citrulline and trans-4-hydroxyproline, glycerophospholipids PC aa C28:1, PC ae C30:0 and PC ae C30:2, and sphingolipid SM (OH) C14:1, were associated with prostate cancer (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), but none of the associations were statistically significant after controlling for multiple testing. Citrulline was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR1SD)â€‰=â€‰0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62â€“0.86; ptrendâ€‰=â€‰0.0002) in the first 5Â years of follow-up after taking multiple testing into account, but not after longer follow-up; results for other metabolites did not vary by time to diagnosis. After controlling for multiple testing, 12 glycerophospholipids were inversely associated with advanced stage disease, with risk reduction up to 46% per standard deviation increase in concentration (OR1SDâ€‰=â€‰0.54; 95% CI 0.40â€“0.72; ptrendâ€‰=â€‰0.00004 for PC aa C40:3). Death from prostate cancer was associated with higher concentrations of acylcarnitine C3, amino acids methionine and trans-4-hydroxyproline, biogenic amine ADMA, hexose and sphingolipid SM (OH) C14:1 and lower concentration of glycerophospholipid PC aa C42:4.ConclusionsSeveral metabolites, i.e. C18:1, citrulline, trans-4-hydroxyproline, three glycerophospholipids and SM (OH) C14:1, might be related to prostate cancer. Analyses by time to diagnosis indicated that citrulline may be a marker of subclinical prostate cancer, while other metabolites might be related to aetiology. Several glycerophospholipids were inversely related to advanced stage disease.

However, characterizations of the human gut microbiome have largely relied on stool samples, and the associated methodologies are ill-suited for theÂ viscosity and low microbial biomass of small intestine samples. As part of the REIMAGINE study to examine the specific roles of the small bowel microbiome in human health and disease, this study aimed to develop and validate methodologies to optimize microbial analysis of the small intestine.ResultsSubjects undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation for standard of care were prospectively recruited, and ~â€‰2â€‰ml samples of luminal fluid were obtained from the duodenum using a custom sterile aspiration catheter. Samples of duodenal aspirates were either untreated (DA-U, NÂ =â€‰127) or pretreated with dithiothreitol (DA-DTT, NÂ =â€‰101), then cultured on MacConkey agar for quantitation of aerobic gram-negative bacteria, typically from the class Gammaproteobacteria, and on blood agar for quantitation of anaerobic microorganisms. DA-DTT exhibited 2.86-fold greater anaerobic bacterial counts compared to DA-U (PÂ =â€‰0.0101), but were not statistically different on MacConkey agar.DNA isolation from DA-U (NÂ =â€‰112) and DA-DTT (NÂ =â€‰43) samples and library preparation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also performed using modified protocols. DA-DTT samples exhibited 3.81-fold higher DNA concentrations (PÂ =â€‰0.0014) and 4.18-fold higher 16S library concentrations (PÂ <â€‰0.0001) then DA-U samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed increases in the detected relative abundances of obligate and facultative anaerobes in DA-DTT samples, including increases in the genera Clostridium (false discovery rate (FDR) PÂ =â€‰4.38E-6), Enterococcus (FDR PÂ =â€‰2.57E-8), Fusobacterium (FDR PÂ =â€‰0.02) and Bacteroides (FDR PÂ =â€‰5.43E-9). Detected levels of Gram-negative enteropathogens from the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Klebsiella (FDR PÂ =â€‰2.73E-6) and Providencia (FDR Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) (family Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas (family Pseudomonadaceae) (FDR PÂ =â€‰0.04), were also increased in DA-DTT samples.ConclusionsThis study validates novel DTT-based methodology which optimizes microbial culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the study of the small bowel microbiome.

1c1aaf112bfa0db2184327dc67f6e3883971919d,BM-BC: a Bayesian method of base calling for Solexa sequence data,"Base calling is a critical step in the Solexa next-generation sequencing procedure. It compares the position-specific intensity measurements that reflect the signal strength of four possible bases (A, C, G, T) at each genomic position, and outputs estimates of the true sequences for short reads of DNA or RNA. We present a Bayesian method of base calling, BM-BC, for Solexa-GA sequencing data. The Bayesian method builds on a hierarchical model that accounts for three sources of noise in the data, which are known to affect the accuracy of the base calls: fading, phasing, and cross-talk between channels. We show that the new method improves the precision of base calling compared with currently leading methods. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a probability score that measures the confidence of each base call.

a49fc3775cfe46abb9a1288f14594cf22913da0d,Systematic Identification of Correlates of HIV-1 Infection: An X-Wide Association Study in Zambia,"Background HIV-1 remains the leading cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, and over 1 million people are infected annually. Better identification of at-risk groups could benefit prevention and treatment programmes. We systematically identified factors related to HIV-1 infection in two nationally representative cohorts of women that participated in Zambiaâ€™s Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify and replicate the association of 1,415 social, economic, environmental, and behavioral indicators with HIV-1 status. We used the 2007 and 2013-2014 DHS surveys conducted among 5,715 and 15,433 Zambian women, respectively (727 indicators in 2007; 688 in 2013-2014; 688 in both). We used false discovery rate criteria to identify indicators that are strongly associated with HIV-1 in univariate and multivariate models in the entire population, as well as in subgroups stratified by wealth, residence, age, and history of HIV-1 testing. Findings In the univariate analysis we identified 102 and 182 variables that are associated with HIV-1 in the 2007 and 2013-2014 surveys, respectively, among which 79 were associated in both. Variables that were associated with HIV-1 status in all full-sample models (unadjusted and adjusted) as well as in at least 17 out of 18 subgroups include being formerly in a union (adjusted OR 2007 2.8, p<10âˆ’16; 2013-2014 2.8, p<10âˆ’29), widowhood (adjusted OR 2007 3.7, p<10âˆ’12; 2013-2014 4.2, p<10âˆ’30), history of genital ulcers in the last 12 months (adjusted 2007 OR 2.4, p<10âˆ’5; 2013-2014 2.2, p<10âˆ’6), and having a woman for the head of the household (2007 OR 1.7, p<10âˆ’7; 2013-2014 OR 2.1, p<10âˆ’26), while owning a bicycle (adjusted 2007 OR 0.6, p<10âˆ’6; 2013-2014 0.6, p<10âˆ’8) and currently breastfeeding (adjusted 2007 OR 0.5, p<10âˆ’9; 2013-2014 0.4, p<10âˆ’26) were associated with decreased risk. Using the identified variables, area under the curve for HIV-1 positivity ranged from 0.76 to 0.82. Interpretation Our X-wide association study in Zambian women identifies multiple under-recognized factors correlated with HIV-1 infection in 2007 and 2013-2014, including widowhood, breastfeeding, and being the head of the household. These variables could be used to improve HIV-1 testing and identification programs.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chirag J.

We hypothesised that once cloned embryos were transferred to a suitable recipient the conceptus and endometrial interaction during peri-implantation stage was a remarkable step that determines the pregnancy outcome. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlining this phenomenon, the present experiment was conducted to compare the transcriptome profile of Day-16 elongated embryos derived from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and fertilized controls, namely, artificially inseminated (AI) and in vitro fertilized (IVF) using bovine genome Affymetrix array. Following total RNA isolation from 3 replicates of each group, biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized on 9 bovine chips. Data were normalized by using guanine cytosine robust multi-array analysis (GCRMA) and analysis was performed using the LIMMA package in R software. The present findings demonstrate that the gene expression profile of SCNT elongated embryos closely resembled those of the in vitro fertilized group. Only 10 genes were found to be differentially regulated between SCNT and IVF embryos (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05, fold changeâ€‰â‰¥2 and false discovery rate 20%). On the other hand 303 and 336 genes were differentially expressed in IVF vs AI and NT vs AI embryos comparisons, respectively. Majority of the transcripts were found to be down-regulated on IVF embryos, whereas only 21 transcripts were up-regulated. Moreover, 158 and 178 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in NT embryos as compared with AI. The NT embryos were found to be enriched with transcripts responsible for lipid metabolism (ACOX1, ACOT4 and ACOT8) and molecular transport (B4GALT1, ERBB3, MIF and PRKAG2) compared with AI. Moreover, genes involved in cell movement (CD97, CTSL1, F2R, ITGA and ITGAV) were highly abundant in IVF embryos compared with AI. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially regulated genes showed that metabolic and tight junction pathways and the genes involved in these pathways were activated in NT and IVP elongated embryos, respectively, as compared with AI. In conclusion, elongated embryos from NT and IVP pregnancies show differences in expression of genes involved in various biological processes compared with their AI counterparts.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Simret Betsha"", ids = ""11847291""); list(name = ""Dessie Salilew-Wondim"", ids = ""1390134427""); list(name = ""Vita Havlicek"", ids = ""46519985""); list(name = ""Urban Besenfelder"", ids = ""6623068""); list(name = ""Franca Rings"", ids = ""4476433""); list(name = ""Michael Hoelker"", ids = ""3751413""); list(name = ""Karl Schellander"", ids = ""2940405""); list(name = ""Dawit Tesfaye"", ids = ""145447347"")",,,"Reproduction, Fertility and Development",24,126-126
749874e5ea4d54dedcd5b858876513ada9b78e09,Statistical power of Fisher test for the detection of short periodic gene expression profiles,"Many cellular processes exhibit periodic behaviors. Hence, one of the important tasks in gene expression data analysis is to detect subset of genes that exhibit cyclicity or periodicity in their gene expression time series profiles. Unfortunately, gene expression time series profiles are usually of very short length, with very few periods, irregularly sampled and are highly contaminated with noise. This makes the detection of periodic profiles a very challenging problem. Recently, a hypothesis testing method based on the Fisher g-statistic with correction for multiple testing has been proposed to detect periodic gene expression profiles. However, it was observed that the test is not reliable if the signal length is too short. In this paper, we performed extensive simulation study to investigate the statistical power of the test as a function of noise distribution, signal length, SNR, and the false discovery rate (FDR). We have found that the number of periodic profiles can be severely underestimated for short length signal. The findings indicate that caution needs to be exercised when interpreting the test result for very short length signals.",2009,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alan Wee-Chung Liew"", ids = ""1733300""); list(name = ""Ngai-Fong Law"", ids = ""144085822""); list(name = ""Xiao-Qin Cao"", ids = ""1984986""); list(name = ""Hong Yan"", ids = ""145282215"")",452646591ab86ceb8caeb8f74a9e0554c88ad5c6; 80bc08fdcbb6ffda07c4323c8c79eab01cbdafae; 56bceb78b9cd9a8eb43cb08b3df0dafe5307c674; e4e0fccddab6e33ada421f87b2cdc356321b017e; cf490da9a419766f48a820442f0b38ce24e573c1; d43b475a46c3d153c83807f25773c5f8c70fb156; f77fa23a0281c270f837ce544b53b42c726cba70; df31385cd4b557cad45610b66a2c8a795ff37df6; 6de5ace1889637be99c4f76d28053049565a6924; d105d72d10bab9abb46e719ba2fe4b4109a9b51d; bda01d255bd36d4123119a9cecdfa5fdbc3ca72b; c54e9944b0bcbcea58cfb0e7416b15a0f1a0f049; 6e86352aa9dd743880aca1d7cdca128c93be0c8a; 0450fd512d709dc2a2c20f1fec20d52c72b5087b; a2f452926d9b4eb9b649746046de436ffa55080a; 00582b749fa16dc156ab7dbdc53118a71072e0ee; 0f5334cafd5872a4e867389a0dbdb09197ae59e5; bbe12bbc25de7620ed6adff2387ab27c95044fa2; 88f5611c9696b58435133e5a60b9323b67f1b8b9; f96c1a43fa40771ac6b910ec54fd9ec619bc690b; f8ea82818667e9fcb8fcdf6ecbe1be25840537ca,5c4b33dea00608adb7256414845abc82c4f263ab; f4dfcb1f29476407b7b7f751abc28975b52d3978; 7ef32f438ed0201c30afee1b20a66a8e38ade5a9; 5f2199e859148f6084ab23d19381b4cc45dbcd12; 42a2ae9738c7be59f4c8feace3c61a8ce8c1e20f; 52c9079a7bcb95f2dcc7a5107286da9bed9b1599; 8a301bd33fa636d196b5ed6f951238e4ee471263; 33178c2f8b5251bae43dd6cec16d629ad6d8c134; d0183bd780fd8bc14a3c519ffcbdfb24a04c7a7d; 68dfda30c0fbabc035c51ef072a80f3ca71f857a; e3d0242d60d923721faa316d6aa595e01dd182ef; 1639802078ae4d63eca9873d79b680983abea22b; 6019c9de50b29fb9f00b55801f3208c98281c637; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5bf8d122b1ab4133062417e37a274ac9ebc58cb6; 956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff; 571b6b24b2a942245f785ca8ec0a08367a57b665,Pattern Recognit.,42,549-556
25c16a40138b7828d438cde53534896c6e683075,Fully Bayesian Mixture Model for Differential Gene Expression: Simulations and Model Checks,"We present a Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differentially expressed genes using a mixture prior on the parameters representing differential effects. We formulate an easily interpretable 3-component mixture to classify genes as over-expressed, under-expressed and non-differentially expressed, and model gene variances as exchangeable to allow for variability between genes. We show how the proportion of differentially expressed genes, and the mixture parameters, can be estimated in a fully Bayesian way, extending previous approaches where this proportion was fixed and empirically estimated. Good estimates of the false discovery rates are also obtained.Different parametric families for the mixture components can lead to quite different classifications of genes for a given data set. Using Affymetrix data from a knock out and wildtype mice experiment, we show how predictive model checks can be used to guide the choice between possible mixture priors. These checks show that extending the mixture model to allow extra variability around zero instead of the usual point mass null fits the data better.A software package for R is available.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alexandra M.

We hypothesized that specific pathways exist that are associated with increased mammographic density, and may therefore be used to identify potential targets for chemoprevention. Histologically confirmed normal breast tissue was collected from women undergoing breast surgery who had available demographic data and mammograms for review. Women with low versus high mammographic breast density were compared. Differentially expressed genes using Affymetrix HG U133Plus2 chips were identified in dense versus non-dense tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki67, and COX2 expression was performed. About 66 women were identified, 28 (42%) had high, and 38 (58%) had low mammographic density. About 73 genes had differential expression between normal breast tissue with high and low mammographic density (PÂ <Â 0.001, fold change â‰¥1.5with a low false discovery rate (<10%). Network and canonical pathway analysis indicated decreased TGFÎ² signaling (TGFBR2, SOS, SMAD3, CD44 and TNFRSF11B) in dense breast tissue relative to non-dense breast. By IHC, only COX2 expression in the stroma was statistically significant on multivariate analysis. TGFÎ² ligands are currently the only growth factors known to prevent mammary epithelial cell proliferation. TGFÎ² signaling has been reported to be inhibited by COX-2, and these molecules are highly differentially expressed in individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer. These results strongly suggest that COX2 inhibition should be investigated for breast cancer prevention despite possible increase in cardiovascular risk.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Yang"", ids = ""144136143""); list(name = ""Michael T.

Consequently, 697 probe sets showed significant expression changes in the odorant-inhaling rats subjected to 2 h of restraint stress (false discovery rate < 0.05). We observed up-regulation of 594 among them, including genes related to neuron differentiation and transcriptional regulatory factors. Another important result was that inhalation of (R)-(-)-linalool returned the expression of 49 restraint-regulated genes to a normal condition. In contrast, the inhalation also further up-regulated the expression of 16 restraint-up-regulated genes that included those encoding heat shock proteins as factors to induce some biological responses against stresses. In the present study we thus found the substantial example that, in the hypothalamus involved in feeding behaviors, an inhaled pleasant odor acts to regulate the gene expression related to the functions of neuronal developments to cope with stresses.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Akio Nakamura"", ids = ""2462801""); list(name = ""Satoshi Fujiwara"", ids = ""49905175""); list(name = ""Tomoko Ishijima"", ids = ""35032523""); list(name = ""Shinji Okada"", ids = ""34682058""); list(name = ""Yuji Nakai"", ids = ""2359288""); list(name = ""Ichiro Matsumoto"", ids = ""120344371""); list(name = ""Takumi Misaka"", ids = ""5963694""); list(name = ""Keiko Abe"", ids = ""1699047"")",8b398394e8923fff1f2c986334057e7706101e8d; 732cd30b11f2d9b33722f3a73fc6db9f239d8358; c14fe17840bc296c6116c27cc4eee2f90f7b8a50; a4209bb25bb4a60f7449acfd73f637668e8ff89a; 02776b90594facff80a858980e31266291957665; faf6bc0cf88a3d66fed86cfb59e00e211032040f; 9b83da4be40f89904173a1717a43315db19c95d6; 540481b975e9fbd05dfca2485113e87ed861704d; 06b57e91ed0bb52508ad29cc088cbb9c54b50430; cebe63b1a18a4949bc3f536150b9dc9d7e62164b; 46a0f7b7e0b3aa8606e78481c631e90bd3d1131a; c1c1374ad02f9ff8994fd6ec0ffe9f3a173c6896,,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,58 13,"

However, the identification of this epileptogenic zone (EZ) is often imprecise which may affect post-surgical outcomes (PSOs). Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been revealed to be reliable biomarkers in delineating EZ. In this paper, an analytical methodology aiming at automated detection and classification of interictal HFOs is proposed to improve the identification of EZ. Furthermore, the detected high-rate HFO areas were compared with the seizure onset zones (SOZs) and resected areas to investigate their clinical relevance in predicting PSOs. Methods FIR band-pass filtering as well as a combination of time-series local energy, peak, and duration analysis were utilized to identify high-rate HFO areas in interictal, multi-channel intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings. The detected HFOs were then classified into fast-ripple (FR), ripple (R), and fast-ripple concurrent with ripple (FRandR) events. Results The proposed method resulted in sensitivity of 91.08% and false discovery rate of 7.32%. Moreover, it was found that the detected HFO-FRandR areas in concordance with the SOZs would have better delineated the EZ for each patient, while limiting the area of the brain required to be resected. Conclusion Testing on a dataset of 20 patients has supported the feasibility of using this method to provide an automated algorithm to better delineate the EZ.

e52ca98df02fdeda136c36123a614a95579a3f1c,Bioactive lipids in emphysema. Decoding fat to reveal COPD phenotypes.,"It is reassuring to know that in the 21st century, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is appropriately recognized not as a single disease but as a constellation of heterogeneous lung diseases with several distinct phenotypes (1, 2). Given how lipids and their bioactive metabolites provide essential structural and functional support in all living organisms (e.g., participating in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, migration, and organ vascularization), it is not surprising that their role has been actively investigated in the complex pathobiology of COPD. Specifically, among different classes of lipids, sphingolipids have been highlighted as key bioactive metabolites and potential biomarkers in COPD (3). 
 
Ceramides (Cer), sphingomyelins (SM), and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are among the most common bioactive lipid mediators, some of which act as the extracellular ligands for G-protein-coupled receptors (4). S1P and its receptor, S1PR1 (expressed on lymphocytes), have been shown to be required for cell egression from the lymphoid system and into tissue under normal conditions (5). The discovery of S1P-mediated gradient formation and lymphocyte trafficking has stimulated the development of novel therapeutic agents (e.g., fingolimod) that suppress the immune system and treat some of the most recalcitrant autoimmune inflammatory diseases (6). Whether S1P or other bioactive lipids specifically promote acquired immune responses in smoke-induced lung inflammation, and whether their modulation could be used as novel therapeutics in different COPD phenotypes, remains unclear. 
 
Smoking has been linked to increased lung Cer concentrations. This increase in Cer level has in turn been linked to the activation of apoptosis, impaired efferocytosis, and abnormal tissue repair that could collectively culminate in emphysema (7). Further, sphingolipids have been shown to be elevated in the sputum of smokers with COPD (8), suggesting that various sphingolipids might be associated with different COPD phenotypes. 
 
In this issue of the Journal, Bowler and colleagues (pp. 275â€“284) examined the association between sphingolipids and different phenotypes in COPD (9). The authors used biological samples (plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) collected from the COPDGene cohort to show that several sphingolipids found in the plasma are strongly associated with emphysema and COPD exacerbation phenotypes, but not with airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis. They arrive at their conclusion by first performing a targeted study of 69 distinct sphingolipid species that were used for quantitative comparison in 129 current and former smokers. After adjusting for multiple covariates (e.g., age, sex, body mass index, and current smoking) and false discovery rate, they found that concentrations of Cer, SM, and gangliosides were strongly and inversely associated with emphysema phenotype in smokers (Figure 1). Employing receiver operating characteristic curves, they demonstrated that several sphingolipids improved diagnosis of moderate to severe emphysema beyond clinical and physiological covariates. Using a similar strategy, they identified 11 sphingolipids including four trihexosylceramides, three dihexosylceramides, sulfatide, and ganglioside that were positively, whereas S1P and SM were negatively, associated with severe COPD exacerbations. In support of these findings, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that these 11 sphingolipids improved the ability to diagnose severe exacerbations beyond just clinical and physiologic covariates. The authors explored geneâ€“metabolite association with their phenotypic analysis and show that sphingnosineâ€“CYR61 is associated with severe emphysema whereas Cerâ€“Acer is associated with severe COPD exacerbations.

The strength of the work includes the study population (the well-phenotyped COPDGene cohort), as well as replication of some of the markers using untargeted mass spectrometry in an independent laboratory. Some of the caveats of the study include using plasma samples that were not collected at the time of COPD exacerbation to measure trihexosylceramide levels. Given this limitation, which could significantly affect their findings, this biomarker might not support the conclusion that a rapid flux of sphingosine-to-ceramide-to-glycosylated ceramide metabolism occurs in smokers with COPD exacerbation. Further, a large study using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and mixed-effect models reported that higher plasma concentrations of sphingomyelin predicted increased annual progression of emphysema (10). These findings appear to be contradictory to the current report that found a negative correlation between most of the sphingolipid species and emphysema severity (9). However, there are several differences between these reports that might provide insight to the seemingly divergent results. 
 
First, the report by Bowler and colleagues is based on cross-sectional analysis of many highly bioactive lipids; in contrast, the MESA study examined plasma SMs to evaluate longitudinal changes in emphysema progression using serial chest computed tomography scans (9, 10). Second, the sample size in the MESA study was much larger, and the cohort was drawn from the general population (never and ever smokers) without selecting for lung disease per se, whereas the COPDGene cohort was designed to recruit smokers with and without COPD. Finally, the current report measured a large number of SMs in relation to several clinical endpoints in a relatively small cohort, whereas the MESA study used a large cohort, and its single endpoint was focused on changes in emphysema progression. Barring differences in the methodology used to measure SMs (mass spectroscopy versus spectrophotometric assays), the differences in study design (cross-sectional versus longitudinal) could account for their divergent findings. 
 
Overall, the current study adds significantly to our understanding of how metabolic pathways might be activated in smokers with different clinical phenotypes. Further, phenotypic characterization of this population in turn could identify novel bioactive lipids that could be linked to disease pathogenesis. More work is required to further clarify how quantitative measurement of bioactive lipids could be used to complement our current clinical and physiological assays to better diagnose emphysema and understand why patients with COPD exacerbate. Finally this work reminds us that ancillary studies in large, well-phenotyped cohorts (e.g., MESA, COPDGene, SPIROMICS, etc.) allow the testing of novel hypotheses to provide new insight into the conundrum of COPD.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mehdi Mirzaie"", ids = ""3262716""); list(name = ""Farrah Kheradmand"", ids = ""4511836"")",8ae190a63393e9b2fbab8ea893b6a77a408dfe11; d6a016ad42bf0f174e010e92516860feed35c9aa,,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,191 3,"

59be138b43ed74675e87113fbdcd6a1553c46507,Broad functional correction of molecular impairments by systemic delivery of scAAVrh74-hSGSH gene delivery in MPS IIIA mice.,"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIA is a neuropathic lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency in N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH). Genome-wide gene expression microarrays in MPS IIIA mice detected broad molecular abnormalities (greater than or equal to twofold, false discovery rate â‰¤10) in numerous transcripts (314) in the brain and blood (397). Importantly, 22 dysregulated blood transcripts are known to be enriched in the brain and linked to broad neuronal functions. To target the root cause, we used a self-complementary AAVrh74 vector to deliver the human SGSH gene into 4-6 weeks old MPS IIIA mice by an intravenous injection. The treatment resulted in global central nervous system (CNS) and widespread somatic restoration of SGSH activity, clearance of CNS and somatic glycosaminoglycan storage, improved behavior performance, and significantly extended survival. The scAAVrh74-hSGSH treatment also led to the correction of the majority of the transcriptional abnormalities in the brain (95.9%) and blood (97.7%), of which 182 and 290 transcripts were normalized in the brain and blood, respectively. These results demonstrate that a single systemic scAAVrh74-hSGSH delivery mediated efficient restoration of SGSH activity and resulted in a near complete correction of MPS IIIA molecular pathology. This study also demonstrates that blood transcriptional profiles reflect the biopathological status of MPS IIIA, and also respond well to effective treatments.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""F.

ea471470d879bcdc1164fc70fd513c83bad4b7be,Vector-model-supported approach in prostate plan optimization.,"Lengthy time consumed in traditional manual plan optimization can limit the use of step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric-modulated radiotherapy (S&S IMRT/VMAT). A vector model base, retrieving similar radiotherapy cases, was developed with respect to the structural and physiologic features extracted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. Planning parameters were retrieved from the selected similar reference case and applied to the test case to bypass the gradual adjustment of planning parameters. Therefore, the planning time spent on the traditional trial-and-error manual optimization approach in the beginning of optimization could be reduced. Each S&S IMRT/VMAT prostate reference database comprised 100 previously treated cases. Prostate cases were replanned with both traditional optimization and vector-model-supported optimization based on the oncologists' clinical dose prescriptions. A total of 360 plans, which consisted of 30 cases of S&S IMRT, 30 cases of 1-arc VMAT, and 30 cases of 2-arc VMAT plans including first optimization and final optimization with/without vector-model-supported optimization, were compared using the 2-sided t-test and paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, with a significance level of 0.05 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. For S&S IMRT, 1-arc VMAT, and 2-arc VMAT prostate plans, there was a significant reduction in the planning time and iteration with vector-model-supported optimization by almost 50%. When the first optimization plans were compared, 2-arc VMAT prostate plans had better plan quality than 1-arc VMAT plans. The volume receiving 35â€‰Gy in the femoral head for 2-arc VMAT plans was reduced with the vector-model-supported optimization compared with the traditional manual optimization approach. Otherwise, the quality of plans from both approaches was comparable. Vector-model-supported optimization was shown to offer much shortened planning time and iteration number without compromising the plan quality.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eva Sau Fan Liu"", ids = ""50323864""); list(name = ""Vincent Wc Wu"", ids = ""47252904""); list(name = ""Brigita Harris"", ids = ""38085409""); list(name = ""Margot Lehman"", ids = ""39628039""); list(name = ""David I Pryor"", ids = ""46792476""); list(name = ""Lawrence Wing Chi Chan"", ids = ""16760120"")",ea997f8757fa8000e3037ae8d016495f62e95895; 1a1ce5bb66235774d960487a0285ab91339bbd4b; 3348fb223ca6f0c83b89a9f18963a2c1f768ddcb,fe9a25a68c3e7d4377d11860011627de599bed4b; ce1e3528047cd01937f6a8aa760640f6b3c8d531; ec43db5405719de7bc7954719a74a2f29c70e99a; 36b3711f06725def5884d9d9a48ad689d8187149; 29755097653d0384d73333262379b34a36bac57f; 0f2716c152c4a150225017e24a85871e230bf8e8; ebba6015974423b1c9e9af85e81aa1418438e47b; 4db0cb0e1b03e0705daaf8721f07651b9f18efa4; 25665f50ead6a90e82747d88cfa55243b28aef60; d9657399063a26608020c9fe7427449bd1e4b55b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; d4ec387bb885299d155ff939610c3ecb094c5404; b3c4ae95067a2c1525d9fa88499fb8580fc45b8b; ed7f0b5e49574257b6b621416c906eec75fc9fb4; 2c86deb0e77a7fb9853472ec39749d209adb9440; 127781798c944abb646ab40ff45ddb4a5b6b259c; 058af3dd7e9a4cbc81902b4337f6e91fa88eb796; 89e37c306d5f14c39567e924d5b8f53a2c09c979; d1ade331ce5e4811bd5e7a7bc2467f58bee74c5b; 747c6002686c66f2ef1b16a6d0142d0439ad050f; 5fac84ef49bc6dcc4aeaf6c5623173f8c0e2a531; 2ffd1bc51e3a225ffee68d8bdd7312d5bf99e81d; 28d9f9cb94b1295fb2f03103a0c4d2eb72298445,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,42 2,"

0360f20bad6d1c47f60a807a8b59cb3b4bf4e897,Amnestic mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: a brain perfusion SPECT study.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with amnestic deficit (PD-MCI). Perfusion single photon emission computed tomography was performed in 15 PD-MCI patients and compared (statistical parametric mapping [SPM2]) with three groups, i.e., healthy subjects (CTR), cognitively intact PD patients (PD), and common amnestic MCI patients (aMCI). Age, depression, and UPDRS-III scores were considered as confounding variables. PD-MCI group (P < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected for multiple comparisons) showed relative hypoperfusion in bilateral posterior parietal lobe and in right occipital lobe in comparison to CTR. As compared to aMCI, MCI-PD demonstrated hypoperfusion in bilateral posterior parietal and occipital areas, mainly right cuneus and angular gyrus, and left precuneus and middle occipital gyrus. With a less conservative threshold (uncorrected P < 0.01), MCI-PD showed hypoperfusion in a left parietal region, mainly including precuneus and inferior parietal lobule, and in a right temporal-parietal-occipital region, including middle occipital and superior temporal gyri, and cuneus-precuneus, as compared to PD. aMCI versus PD-MCI showed hypoperfusion in bilateral medial temporal lobe, anterior cingulate, and left orbitofrontal cortex. PD-MCI patients with amnestic deficit showed cortical dysfunction in bilateral posterior parietal and occipital lobes, a pattern that can be especially recognized versus both controls and common aMCI patients, and to a lesser extent versus cognitively intact PD. The relevance of this pattern in predicting dementia should be evaluated in longitudinal studies.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Flavio Nobili"", ids = ""1883019""); list(name = ""Giovanni Abbruzzese"", ids = ""49486232""); list(name = ""Silvia Morbelli"", ids = ""3732613""); list(name = ""Roberta Marchese"", ids = ""4462147""); list(name = ""Nicola Girtler"", ids = ""4000123""); list(name = ""Barbara Dessi"", ids = ""5741803""); list(name = ""Andrea Brugnolo"", ids = ""7023043""); list(name = ""Cinzia Canepa"", ids = ""32457190""); list(name = ""Giorgos Chr Drosos"", ids = ""5117651""); list(name = ""Gianmario Sambuceti"", ids = ""2242364""); list(name = ""Guido Rodriguez"", ids = ""144030987"")",ca11128c7170dbfba6bc5802052ad7d5dc41bb75; d086bc3b97ecd1ed1ad278a1a5bb3dc2dd8355a6; a21465c492411add164b07490ec978030879ea4f; ab56a84addcb1c774bbe03623464f8e4f9dd77a5; 3436a5addd978911156bcf93f74243eccec801c9; f19c2d58c5ba42be27b9dc1795b2a3a2f30007c8; 291c47c7439c064aa9c33d3f0b3dbde756e6611d; 036e3652e30454564d32cebf9127157601a3a743; f796f169a09d5cecb17af67fa4728034a88cbc83; 6ec2f9653146f274d671d0bb51835d1abbcca17d; 14bb981253d6928c3a208f74af6f930adc0a6853; 8e6ae07b4ad66d10ed1fd01c4ed716deaaeacbaf; 7e5923c48c3b7c70c64b44f85793338a2da8ddb0; f210156ea79ccb6c47cc1d9538b0a8f4d6eafe42; e73ac2fe6d89007d17006ec68f0da08635b2334d; 22207475ebcc82ad333145fe0d2b946870d5cee4; be2da65afe5b426089ed68d1aa1284f4bcce1e40; 797377eadc4156a8d5a976429ad73d75e000902d; 46a6ee8cef3fe508e134128905931db52aa9e7e3; 9211b9ed7cdd7786b2c21e0b9571e9439fe5aec3; 24578a99fcbe7c456992734bfd2685d8c61c5484; d1c57eda520d3d11c93acc335099e8792ed57839; 147fa097405db62b61105d0feb8766cb25852f5d; 6e34028a786a7c7e5fdc5f134a88580a438959b5; cd164589a55dc5696167bd877577151387b8497c; e7b2df0430e052a75ec8ca8c2e1f3db92f8eaaf3; 8b46543f928caae84ea01e9c36f10fc2056e1816; 1cb13f262801fb1ebe17031523993a355074d64d; 295ea96eed413d839c7c4f5d96f4ae9eb1354a22; 5212b25e62ddf6b45be51088bf5f76f3b4f5b97b; 5f6e081c6bd6b68f930ffd4650ac1f5bc40d3aef; 66a2b70d9ee1b299e484a3c6ec766beb2ec4bf75; 626ed2a12126dfda51b2107a4ba9b4b9df31beb7; d4c5414c0f01a512d22cd545b6e7c95bec5bb28c; d36388931b5e701d06b3493e9c716fd17ab62750; 8f4944d3c4d0a5e4befe4a44028f9fddc39428b0; 6dbc8582314bf523f2da371a3012d2c7e8337533; c9fbe0da2ee0539f780180ea4ae0ff1b690d7103; 523a979f21f8d9b49af03c8d1c32eb2d9c2f87dd; 31b337757bb336657083f9fdc5dcdc59ecf5f731; 8744b6ce4bdd9c364acd5bd51c62621dfeed23b9; 756492288e5b5ce471ac1286e9e2aa453d8f9e16; 768097b542a331f8ad86367754aadee1caa6da72; f7c9a8f71933705291bf4d72abb2492facfe5765; 41a9e410dcccabfa14812e2efee9019663a04103; e30a5d339b05ad8b54d9e6042cb15efe95e72f65; 9ae8a50d428527067f6607ed1c72751d39350145,,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,24 3,"

cb659b8621aec26753be46335f563b3addd119de,Building high-quality assay libraries for targeted analysis of SWATH MS data,"Targeted proteomics by selected/multiple reaction monitoring (S/MRM) or, on a larger scale, by SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra) MS (mass spectrometry) typically relies on spectral reference libraries for peptide identification. Quality and coverage of these libraries are therefore of crucial importance for the performance of the methods. Here we present a detailed protocol that has been successfully used to build high-quality, extensive reference libraries supporting targeted proteomics by SWATH MS. We describe each step of the process, including data acquisition by discovery proteomics, assertion of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), generation of consensus spectra and compilation of MS coordinates that uniquely define each targeted peptide. Crucial steps such as false discovery rate (FDR) control, retention time normalization and handling of post-translationally modified peptides are detailed. Finally, we show how to use the library to extract SWATH data with the open-source software Skyline. The protocol takes 2â€“3 d to complete, depending on the extent of the library and the computational resources available.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Olga T.

d55a714cc862b3907da80e2d9c6682bb9a7fc501,"A functional variant in the serotonin receptor 7 gene (HTR7), rs7905446, is associated with good response to SSRIs in bipolar and unipolar depression","Predicting antidepressant response has been a clinical challenge for mood disorder. Although several genome-wide association studies have suggested a number of genetic variants to be associated with antidepressant response, the sample sizes are small and the results are difficult to replicate. Previous animal studies have shown that knockout of the serotonin receptor 7 gene (HTR7) resulted in an antidepressant-like phenotype, suggesting it was important to antidepressant action. In this report, in the first stage, we used a cost-effective pooled-sequencing strategy to sequence the entire HTR7 gene and its regulatory regions to investigate the association of common variants in HTR7 and clinical response to four selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: citalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine and sertraline) in a retrospective cohort mainly consisting of subjects with bipolar disorder (nâ€‰=â€‰359). We found 80 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with false discovery rate <Â 0.05 associated with response to paroxetine. Among the significant SNPs, rs7905446 (T/G), which is located at the promoter region, also showed nominal significance (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in fluoxetine group. GG/TG genotypes for rs7905446 and female gender were associated with better response to two SSRIs (paroxetine and fluoxetine). In the second stage, we replicated this association in two independent prospective samples of SSRI-treated patients with major depressive disorder: the MARS (nâ€‰=â€‰253, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0169) and GENDEP studies (nâ€‰=â€‰432, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008). The GG/TG genotypes were consistently associated with response in all three samples. Functional study of rs7905446 showed greater activity of the G allele in regulating expression of HTR7. The G allele displayed higher luciferase activity in two neuronal-related cell lines, and estrogen treatment decreased the activity of only the G allele. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that the G allele interacted with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta transcription factor (TF), while the T allele did not show any interaction with any TFs. Our results provided novel pharmacogenomic evidence to support the role of HTR7 in association with antidepressant response.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ya Bin Wei"", ids = ""84178741""); list(name = ""Michael J.

3010152124e76a24200fc3634bed7b01d51dad7a,The effect of image enhancement on the statistical analysis of functional neuroimages: wavelet-based denoising and Gaussian smoothing,"The quality of statistical analyses of functional neuroimages is studied after applying various preprocessing methods. We present wavelet-based denoising as an alternative to Gaussian smoothing, the standard denoising method in statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The wavelet-based denoising schemes are extensions of WaveLab routines, using the symmetric orthogonal cubic spline wavelet basis. In a first study, activity in a time series is simulated by superimposing a timedependent signal on a selected region. We add noise with a known signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial correlation. After denoising, the statistical analysis, performed with SPM, is evaluated. We compare the shapes of activations detected after applying the wavelet-based methods with the shapes of activations detected after Gaussian smoothing. In a second study, the denoising schemes are applied to a real functional MRI time series, where signal and noise cannot be separated. The denoised time series are analysed with SPM, while false discovery rate (FDR) control is used to correct for multiple testing. Wavelet-based denoising, combined with FDR control, yields reliable activation maps. While Gaussian smoothing and wavelet-based methods producing smooth images work well with very low SNRs, less smoothing wavelet-based methods produce better results for time series of moderate quality.",2003,Mathematics; Computer Science; Engineering,"list(name = ""Alle Meije Wink"", ids = ""2552919""); list(name = ""Jos B.

We produced a comprehensive arthropod COI amplicon dataset including annotated arthropod COI sequences and COI sequences extracted from arthropod whole mitochondrion genomes, the latter of which provided the only source of representation for Zoraptera, Callipodida and Holothyrida. The database contains extracted sequences of the target amplicon from all major arthropod clades, including all insect orders, all arthropod classes and Onychophora, Tardigrada and Mollusca outgroups. During curation, we extracted the COI region of interest from approximately 81 percent of the input sequences, corresponding to 73 percent of the genus-level diversity found in the input data. Further, our analysis revealed a high degree of sequence redundancy within the NCBI nucleotide database, with a mean of approximately 11 sequence entries per species in the input data. The curated, low-redundancy database is included in the Metaxa2 sequence classification software (http://microbiology.se/software/metaxa2/). Using this database with the Metaxa2 classifier, we performed a cross-validation analysis to characterize the relationship between the Metaxa2 reliability score, an estimate of classification confidence, and classification error probability. We used this analysis to select a reliability score threshold which minimized error. We then estimated classification sensitivity, false discovery rate and overclassification, the propensity to classify sequences from taxa not represented in the reference database. Our work will help researchers design and evaluate classification databases and conduct metabarcoding on arthropods and alternate taxa.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rodney T.

149e4e200bf18b431dd051569448d76ea6a4717c,Accumulation of minor alleles and risk prediction in schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with a lifetime risk of 1%. Accumulation of common polygenic variations has been found to be an important risk factor. Recent studies showed a role for the enrichment of minor alleles (MAs) of SNPs in complex diseases such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Here we similarly studied the role of genome wide MAs in schizophrenia using public datasets. Relative to matched controls, schizophrenia cases showed higher average values in minor allele content (MAC) or the average amount of MAs per subject. By risk prediction analysis based on weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) of MAs, we identified an optimal MA set consisting of 23 238 variants that could be used to predict 3.14% of schizophrenia cases, which is comparable to using 22q11 deletion to detect schizophrenia cases. Pathway enrichment analysis of these SNPs identified 30 pathways with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.02 and of significant P-value, most of which are known to be linked with schizophrenia and other neurological disorders. These results suggest that MAs accumulation may be a risk factor to schizophrenia and provide a method to genetically screen for this disease.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pei Hua He"", ids = ""50462490""); list(name = ""Xiaoyun Lei"", ids = ""35979998""); list(name = ""Dejian Yuan"", ids = ""4822005""); list(name = ""Zuobin Zhu"", ids = ""4072239""); list(name = ""Shi Huang"", ids = ""144049702"")",fdcf7356153c3845a0e4b3a127522f11a9e0401f; 6696d91a85e5df79d9a5bf0e85c29431998144b5; f95b305f13ca9948bc295603d9ed82a8179b6262; d240fde3016450590c1bbc05713a5dbf2e5aa70b; 00cd72b93984e869e30551379f0667456f82250a; b535d03b77b566d4a77ca4d50c140a7124a8feb7; 8757fab2680197927c1cf743475383775a5df4ee; c0bf099b3b8312a90683ea2cad406f3ac1087a05; 6364e87f4d2eaaf00687e64d446c3da80d9a250e; 1102a8e39c4d9dfba86926f00d17f2f2f848a570; f30986070fd4afcaef554d25ae2c9a21cf885609; 2ef28ae9f4c954ee01b3e17b9573543cca6fecbf,3047b1c96a65c6fab3d4787ea0e5232c9e577427; 92d036e0bf8e2732d04d630c514761c2bf511ee0; 290b9f2a45ef69ad0dec855c3cd4da98a0629f36; 80d9872295ca6c988eef64b86b270c5822fbd566; a8980ddb3b83d6a139543463c9c1b18d307a9338; 2c0c049302588ceb1ba22c319de6226b2b7aea54; a1a8609ff8954f387c0f6fede930b4b53b7737c7; 270c9c8075ca0dee2c73d8235cf27afbb4b2beae; 8356ea36c0fbe188a74e787575fda600b04f104d; fb9b3c16c9161f2fd4d58069a119bb0489698d22; 0047f1bd6925a2124d4db54611a4bc6ed070fe64; d3c205fb541119914ae73c4b12d317e3712c2604; 24067b1612d61792debe9b4cf00b7979fd46f882; f27c0d8fb94f98744d1c0490788db11a11b95b11; abc01b88caa125f8345494ecf6b910c4438c2280; 03a79bd071af8fc9c649612f2632fc11c5d4e2ac; 3c423f11a016b4fd8e170c08cf7dbef20eadb2d7; db23f6496108ff8ec0ee5a77fad83c1856fd2975; f8201a7ccd088a0e7065a7dd055943829e2d0e1d; 05e04c2fde6cc44ff7686c598914c6b0269e2049; 495b8008de9c11455e985211f7c033b38eea6961; 5254d3e9fb9ba9f12d7d465b45af3abeb09dc4b4; 79c979d3436b5714875051b49f6a7955367f4dfe; b92ebaa1ed63bde41d2b000f14d9494c063be5d8; 19706b6e9ba4050a20f2980bea1de35d23882b51; 085b19778895b8871f7a4aa9693ebdb5a23aba86; 343d35b47521f4744623c39cbfc760c6b68c43ba; 72de31338c688d820c30ae5380d5a6b2ad98017a; f132be976371312eedecea1632297d4c15339d4f; 435b5f564a617ada355d749a36527db231babb13; eaefeaee0702da04a1b93808a9bed1f3c7532f97; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 7c9d47c2da56ad9c5267f7160a1e14af62c9d1ed; 75b410ba08b4f94c3decd5576b765a914e5f2f50; 357d34bde49aa2c14325a77a1de2d8227ab55a29; 1239b88111a5f1c20622d58406fb15bf02c31947; 07b8e7f72a0bd530fd68e557a6fac2cd64558f83; d24f7732aa7bbc91293dfbce857831b2f46b48bd; 957fed4fe44b005a8cce18ec76736bee2d436432; afa60f1b91827b820805914c58cf036f6de25f7e; 121fd462b7445009c9c339de1c8fa39406532b9c; 3507a46225b9cfc65bff7bd6a83614db2edb3ebe; 6e00f7980c4efc55ba76efdccebc6411f054a7da; 0b87e0240d9b69be163e38f36436f3fb28f5c11b; cdb1a5a8b0de5559b298388ebbcff32f2fde92b3; 34dbf934f60438c222333e34fb7dc860d81308b0; 599dceeed1c8178a1da7d608db803488d6a467dc; 2bd41ecc131037c0e3c0450aac395d465a2a99b6; cefe303eb85c618d5a2eb20bb2ffcf27067f9fa5; 239b44fd21c3f949f9fdf43bfedd4ab2a3d314e3; cae66e32dba480a9a1f9080839d54a4b3125ab1d; 13cc22a3f71ee9efd8ffe32250c0da910e9de93b; 7b4df12cc5aaf9e4c59fcf0e7c31d66131538dc3; e103fe628f9464beafed05d5920f620cadc7da86; 0c866660f9539688a25a9feff394049b98d67e72; 2b9a44be756993e54d9208486ddc3ff371eb678d; b9b7851cb4c6e823eb37a1b3b8ee16b078a6ecbe; 2e96161a51123049005698504ca93260e4020d72; 7838b69921107bee2ab58392a3dc37858c64f4d5; 4bd54391c91998098a4f7d3ce89d5775e8ab00ac; bc9fbf78617cfb2b43e61905fba23f3d75aa8bd5; fbd0a2cb218ab40f905fa8e9098c51358605c76d; 6556a39b6a41fa2f285929720c36f79feae52538; 1ded8feaf6ca9ed3cb372b42a817deea6cee3a8e; ac4b3751cd22e58dafcb6c3fe72e01918405b55c; 167ea16a581a86ac31d1e88b93ee835aff43f038; 72096141d64e205392ac3f55c4c09409cfc1d5e1; ee86ede391a86bd0f05a89f05b396ad9c4ae52fd; f2c6bf5fc9edea07dbf1cbbd02c75ec745de1515; ff81be396c00211bb906adfc1ba93592ffd41913; 76ef8b1739dce5b548a12d9a7d8a686f6f5eaeb6; 4a268961ab1d7d5f747fcd71313d4ab604fe303f; 7c9c96531aae7afc6bdfbcb1a6e03b20d779a17d; ed345243ba84e779c4a9f069f9593afc6df61ecf; bdd25263c99b1240968145b3237b117840c6b4ee,Scientific Reports,7,
7525cdad8e81091dc81df3a26769d31b0dba4828,Effects of obesity on the association between common variations in the TBX5 gene and matrix metalloproteinase 9 levels in Taiwanese,"OBJECTIVES
The TBX5 gene, a member of the T-box family, is associated with congenital heart disease, electrocardiographic parameters, and development of atrial fibrillation in the general population. This study aimed to elucidate the role of TBX5 gene polymorphisms in metabolic and inflammatory profiles possibly linked to TBX5-related pathologies.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A sample population of 597 individuals having routine health examinations was enrolled. Five tagging TBX5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion or TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Associations between genotypes/haplotypes and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels were investigated using generalized linear model analysis. Interactions between each genotype/haplotype, MMP9 level, and obesity status were tested using two-way analysis of variance with Golden Helix SVS Win32 7.3.1 software.


RESULTS
After adjusting for clinical covariates, TBX5 genotypes were found to be associated with MMP9 levels (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001 for rs4113925 and rs3825214, respectively) in a dominant inheritance model. Haplotype analysis using three tag SNPs (rs11067101, rs1247973, and rs3825214) revealed a significant association between TBX5 haplotype GCG and MMP9 levels (uncorrected p = 0.0093 and the corrected false discovery rate p = 0.0435). Multivariate analysis identified that SNP rs3825214, in addition to the MMP9 and E-selectin genotypes, was independently associated with MMP9 levels (p < 0.001). Using a dominant inheritance model, subgroup and interaction analysis showed associations between the rs4113925, rs3825214, and MMP9 levels only in nonobese individuals (p = 1.04 Ã— 10-4 and p = 7.11 Ã— 10-5, respectively; interaction p = 0.009 and 0.018, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed a borderline significant association between haplotype GCG and MMP9 levels (uncorrected p = 0.020 and corrected false discovery rate p = 0.073), but with no evidence of interaction.


CONCLUSION
TBX5 genotypes/haplotypes are independently associated with MMP9 in Taiwanese individuals and occur predominantly in nonobese people. These associations may broaden our understanding of the mechanism underlying T-box family gene activity and related cardiovascular pathologies.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yaw-Tsan Ho"", ids = ""20851742""); list(name = ""Semon Wu"", ids = ""6962907""); list(name = ""Ching-Feng Cheng"", ids = ""114223113""); list(name = ""Lung-An Hsu"", ids = ""78175856""); list(name = ""Ming-Sheng Teng"", ids = ""12087218""); list(name = ""Ching-Hua Yeh"", ids = ""49136398""); list(name = ""Jeng Feng Lin"", ids = ""31196937""); list(name = ""Yu-Lin Ko"", ids = ""144351438"")",,621ab1f8a401cb51245e3c7908b78ce61da179bc; 54bef81344071f1a7e71bf838fb97b6e45296a2c; 0d8f653f2685eff5bb2daef6d94a0127b215dc0d; a2daf20de977255d8dbf9876727aa2c904df02b4; a03887738dc30050baacd495c4b19a86465cca9d; bf290d9531a76d051e945653a42453ebd9067e5a; d9ee38259269952f29bee5a4465889f19f1d4b03; b3412e876ce4d6755545e98f745dc9537cf2a859; 7b983fcc2f6fb38449efe74ba828ac9d9226e9fb; f14f143629d843f3b5e7397f02f296176184f7ee; a87b6aa499e1d97fbe25876595732c0ce73805a3; 4e904cdff8a53e29825710f5886a4c56e60cd389; 97c7347b38089a8187a2f4d84ba0fb4b973e0bc1; bcf5a978052fe14022384695c3e1ea718461e746; bb27513ed804324bac1e78f0f2ef6b450919e8ea; 526c2f12d4a655e92eebfeaddffeff85b5e9d5d5; 9d053917ea04c954ed6d209516c5e35fb97237e1; bf950788d2999cb9bd3f3986a6158ac39bb62ed6; 0409752a61b27e87efe0c46dd2eddc186323f722; 16a404b2112f0fbeecf60472f4a7007e20410c3d; 1493bb4c52efaef23bfdcca72d77191ee0ef53dc; e725b661b2a8556d04412eab7e4c382dd240eca4; e0afb1d8dd7e56642165d70dbe727a8d91edb6ae; de4b3f2337dbf15f43119c5a4d50df78962fc687; 296fa579862b2b71a60975531b96ad71dce1bc04; 770614001bbe6ae6b034fa744a8b960f99006d8f; cef0c262c68f76bacb5e41664fecd3fdeee1927c; 930afbff712d01a392456ecf3db31e1d704a3fc6; b363c28dfc2942be38eb8bbc2d3e853a516f3238; 8dd6b8bfc08ceb7704478144bbf3de4f6600e9ce; 039c0beb43a75b287415318147dd909cce3dd743; eb1072326a0df10c77aa6742e2d98d290d3ddf8d; 0a6a0d39b6f5e0cda8a46c74403f03cbe83431c1; b36195343515d40dd3d3d950597410078c01f609; 067f559c4f635f16bfee70bd7fb45d16dbaa4ce1; b0876b5d1840aa678d691a3ec7200612f306f2bf; ee7815e254e8006ef8e30addf26df2093b60e60c; 193fc287e75829c5eae7eb5f88d3b6998367dafe; f5cf6581da2b21ba5ac1ab69e3d49b92912e58f6; 225509f61a4efee39f3f1a487efdeca6ff97d9f6; 1688ee01763287bd586ddd871dbfdbeaba6e5b11; 69b9158ba41bff33c57f71acdb127a52e4a8f5b3,Tzu-Chi Medical Journal,28,9 - 14
5961f900df672ef652fee8fe8cb7e4da650efd85,SNP array analysis in hematologic malignancies: avoiding false discoveries.,"Comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome has become a standard approach to identifying new disease loci, and ultimately will guide therapeutic decisions. A key technology in this effort, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, has been applied in hematologic malignancies to detect deletions, amplifications, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at high resolution. An inherent challenge of such studies lies in correctly distinguishing somatically acquired, cancer-specific lesions from patient-specific inherited copy number variations or segments of homozygosity. Failure to include appropriate normal DNA reference samples for each patient in retrospective or prospective studies makes it difficult to identify small somatic deletions not evident by standard cytogenetic analysis. In addition, the lack of proper controls can also lead to vastly overestimated frequencies of LOH without accompanying loss of DNA copies, so-called copy-neutral LOH. Here we use examples from patients with myeloid malignancies to demonstrate the superiority of matched tumor and normal DNA samples (paired studies) over multiple unpaired samples with respect to reducing false discovery rates in high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis. Comparisons between matched tumor and normal samples will continue to be critical as the field moves from high resolution array analysis to deep sequencing to detect abnormalities in the cancer genome.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stefan Heinrichs"", ids = ""145956207""); list(name = ""Cheng Wen Li"", ids = ""49673224""); list(name = ""A Thomas Look"", ids = ""145348521"")",98ccaaccd6999d0641b7ef1ea3ada8d1eba746e1; 80b5f73d61848609da253a561fc389dbea9afda7; 46d07eec0199c7857323cfc53b9f915c8947dc3e; 4f7377af18be9f556849da4c810bf6b2aab36408; ed7a6e2201d51a57ed2848b39670612e365546dd; 03bbd1e2577eec8a243b073ff9a51ea80f491462; bc6263a455c4fc664d5369fb8324c2592f8314e3; c9a4cd57c8529404a66d9219d7254347f85ebbd3; 06484d7c2036645b3012eff87fa1ea25448caa0c; f30c448fd305b580189295e2d17be973535b7021; cb3e64a99f25c837ec0722da836a4ccf81ccddbf; 396a09eda928e5fa0308d797db637496be586a29; c3ea4e133a855e0fa6d432426c159f8cd1a9c84f; c120fd1e183314117dca437d097f6d22c972b092; ca7a9b7c9df25a7ee2a6b299b606983632f77665; 3e70e8ac7e8d1dcaf4d4ce1ce1058a9add92eb6e; 821368a3b7c5700d07082c965cd9499cb089e16a; ee57d8164f0371c966a14f8383f73e1183235fc2; 6dec813cd7d75dd8c180688f49b0086c9f89331d; 0315d1b8ba9bdd90775677a28ec7c2b307a12538; e34d2ab5234a01bad865dfb367d6e36f6f607938; 041a4fa9afd492cc0f8d8537c8087998e8c0344f; e950d4da2c59a8d9c0a3b429b82fccd83eadef0b; 11512d243625f4dfd308552bee0ddd5049f3cdd2; 503c52a22255bf42e994fec30834ca85f324be37; 5dfcc926075e69c2a3f015d039d6581b4c034b87; 4b9e16a2ecf629052d3cc8db53760394856c4fb0; b479939cf7ab8943f318a9d0c29d5b9addcd5a5f; f3ff9a10a34f0b4463e2fcec85f9904012ac5fc6; edea38a0ad71fdc099ccfc8f4f0da6ed14f1b1f3; aa41f2e4d0477d4dd9fc888cd88df795ff1ad376; b0346daa6a96b5b7beb15ae698bf7b97e520546a; f7817d270bec4e5c65f2e9173d2c5f8c0ce99361; 15652e6ff13ce459112c351f3415ce6b01683272; e3da8b7c2120544d7b0e987fa8c323dd26ca7114; 29e1aab2d4d765832f61c132b35743cdbdd18862; 7b6c09d82a8c1afa9b994c099f5616876f7df693; 9ac2bb6443c2e23246d3a30f34b50e909d597bc9; 86be46888017ccf26d342aeaccda67c36c5d5792; ce5e978bb188f2e3eb950229c7f5ab6a1efcae6e; 46abf90f54d62307c210b4ddf8b55b02a181e24b; 92f4762e7cd9a8796978a45988d544347d195be3; 1cde183fb83b58fa5f062fac53a97dc79e27a687; 3d7f8af77f6ef908fb76013580f06725dba56325; f7bcb2499a563accd1fdcd8e4d312d1817420949; 1b4e3fa7a3771d1c7053c3a27fe7c243f5568277; 30d643625d003b8276a445664e72bc055ea3f03d; ac25203d9cb978d834e53525501c9092ffd4539f; 1a25be9e7746b8558363700a76d39314230c2e94; 914d9728343bf85b54dd650a926c05f16730eb2a; 2f9b7adc041089985d184fb67e270484ca19c1ca; 2374fbef039861272ed39fc35bed1232b3191830; 28411dbdb3af17c569f8910b12330cb50b464e95; 09c8dfdf5b7df8da6416c19385ca3f5412004fd4; 5e4823fb95409c2f9d949ab66939656783d158df; 45fc033306dd4fa8e594958aff80b92de9386ab0; 3743f5db89a18fcf8cbfd2543394fac66446f70d; 8cc42d13dcd37f4f737c9277a23e8edb57fdc493; 08900faf1a38e819c30031bdfd51ab40c0e0f5a1; 88aadf86ce3499f992dbc5c4f63b3bf8bcdff04e; 26fa35642f06af03e9f8b59751378d3210e455e3; 59b44832ee253eaa90438a8f36025a7e9db78c12; 27c9961530377bc72a98a4170aaebe6754820324; 35f41f90dc33388dc7edec069f47521ec1aa4129; 1f91c72428df5a5dc928e0437a9d979fd58e022d; e80d950ef86d3852d63833eb7022989294f2d509,ff467434e8024b1c2fda1e162e7528760fb2f6bf; 6da37aabffaf8b75ea48030c262b1cc051405c8a; 9f973ff9a66bef77f0167ce44e1e0de08784275b; cd1fbcaa4c10c8b07ad847af0b5e1bceff43d034; 715a2e9545300b7d65f5a264add603cce47251d4; d7d899089a0aeb296f9b9b84142237d3d1593627; dc9c7bb95c50e87438b85f65332a0ba0e451ca81; 5d3dff66ad728c7f99cd6daedc4da30b60b1ef51; 0e2ed77a2d94d5dc6c74f155d0120553c1d6c0d6; 0990992b07d35d32d055c2e930e533be5282e191; 7903039f03393a4724121ff12b061116a8785565; 8627fab9ddf3fae75bc18a705c4904dac66ff9ab; 87632579587c9e21952e049dc0f91a74f2ebbf59; aec95ec685b7aa0215c3cca08c0bc8fd41c4d900; 215bdc3c1423e64570fda3ef39e43081924f00f0; 135b8fd0998abcbea1de1c1c0170715da3f68ea0; d3d678f8b2f35622167e4392e61ae3c98820fa78; 4249e1d658670c2f3253ecf384f31029acbaddeb; 0ce53cf2bb1ef3f307cd08bffec14d792e553370; 6b372fa1fbf997c8838bcd50cb476c7831c0e791; 025363145963aaf40efac2c4dbaddadba6a63e67; 1fdc7997ac25f343e955a80a0287b49126d32169; 68e5d09126742dbeafc62437037acead230b6ad7; 50e98fd0e7e5290c2418adfc4bd4e0c100e4e836; d282ed002303a37369514aa5347385ca60d88612,Blood,115 21,"

efcc5ef6fb6f033f606e139a6ed65e56d748626f,An empirical Bayesian approach for identifying differential coexpression in high-throughput experiments.,"A common goal of microarray and related high-throughput genomic experiments is to identify genes that vary across biological condition. Most often this is accomplished by identifying genes with changes in mean expression level, so called differentially expressed (DE) genes, and a number of effective methods for identifying DE genes have been developed. Although useful, these approaches do not accommodate other types of differential regulation. An important example concerns differential coexpression (DC). Investigations of this class of genes are hampered by the large cardinality of the space to be interrogated as well as by influential outliers. As a result, existing DC approaches are often underpowered, exceedingly prone to false discoveries, and/or computationally intractable for even a moderately large number of pairs. To address this, an empirical Bayesian approach for identifying DC gene pairs is developed. The approach provides a false discovery rate controlled list of significant DC gene pairs without sacrificing power. It is applicable within a single study as well as across multiple studies. Computations are greatly facilitated by a modification to the expectation-maximization algorithm and a procedural heuristic. Simulations suggest that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in far less computational time; and case study results suggest that the approach will likely prove to be a useful complement to current DE methods in high-throughput genomic studies.",2012,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""John A.

668ca4dc148baaf1fb3a56ae62974b34e19cd59f,A genome-wide expression profile of adrenocortical cells in knockout mice lacking steroidogenic acute regulatory protein.,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) facilitates cholesterol transfer into the inner mitochondrial membrane in the acute phase of steroidogenesis. Mice lacking StAR (Star(-/-)) share phenotypes with human individuals having congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia including compromised production of steroid hormones and florid accumulation of cholesterol esters in adrenal glands and gonads. To define a specific pattern of molecular changes with StAR deficiency, we performed transcriptome analysis of adrenal cells selectively isolated by fluorescent-activated cell sorting at embryonic d 17.5 or 18.5 in seven wild-type (Star(+/+)) or four Star(-/-) mice having the transgene targeting the enhanced green fluorescent protein to cell lineages that express StAR. A gene expression profile was obtained by whole-mouse genome microarray and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR, identifying 1206 and 767 significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively, in Star(-/-) mice compared with Star(+/+) mice (fold difference â‰¥ 2 and P value < 0.05 with false discovery rate < 0.2). In Star(-/-) mice, expression levels of genes involved in cholesterol efflux and the inflammatory response were significantly up-regulated, whereas those related to steroid hormone biosynthesis or cholesterol biosynthesis and influx were not significantly changed. Immunoreactive Iba1 or F4/80 (macrophage marker) in adrenal glands of Star(-/-) mice was detected not only in an increased number of resident macrophages but also in most adrenocortical cells. These findings expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of adrenal glands with the disruption of StAR and propose a reciprocal interaction between adrenocortical cells and resident macrophages inside adrenal glands of Star(-/-) mice.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tomohiro Ishii"", ids = ""47696359""); list(name = ""Toshikatsu Mitsui"", ids = ""7906771""); list(name = ""Sadafumi Suzuki"", ids = ""120297222""); list(name = ""Yumi Matsuzaki"", ids = ""5251570""); list(name = ""Tomonobu Hasegawa"", ids = ""3806373"")",a66f258307802b376795d671029a6416c8c78e60; bbf71d64eafdd7ec68d1356509b32a318d1c9d08; 8440c976078e8013f43d79e5de761f08537a3272; 4e9680f034f925272f185d7970327a039e79acff; e3cd083ccff9842182e5c794c03655ba141f1794,a41fe74689b46fe4c73a3422820086b4be46e02d; d78722233f133da1652784459e64766732853ecc; f58dbe76f79c6f18c96a4eae9e5bdc1c0c38db2e; 1b7dcf6ecf6e5f0edb8f0af32bbfaef83ce8bf31; d438e48881f943ac50cd92cb594733b53caeb84d; 2fb9206263d537353405dfb106b253fea1da9ba9; 6f8182d4b807f877a2e1102ffc95e4392d37a6d0; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 625a4ea743e99fc0e4b6b91f48d7c31bd882df87; ca80eb6d40cb9903d9d84b84489a7a674df1e67a; 293dbe8884c2d1d417a64e4c246688488c1abd61; 3d935704057876ea8ccafbaf8e983788e369731a; c3666b6ca755fb1ea73653f153568a68f94afe8b; 61f7974b0e4f1e818fc06ebe29eb16b8e3a4b839; f310c870c03766e5ba6db4e827c72d408c9896f9; 7101c594d70c94cff63574c1f3da5e5a08034648; 153b76238b54e0dc94ff03b62a739283ff08f430; 3db514274678f6270142f0e68aacd081e0c5443f; 80ee57fc1c2436f5b9b6526d21c76d80d757664c; 390d4e82a1ee6bd507f84b4ba824444a10d458ec; a51f803c65364c25e5803dcaff8713f4ccfef00b; a021f434c326bd7ea95fc55879ffdf463e019791; ef076e9d9f196ff670b181cb70682f70212d4fd4; 3ccb4670bfbcbfb6126b0e6a6ca447ae2e00e470; 5ad4f7fed81f7e440a9eeea86edd76ce28da6829; a45da87ed6e34177f7107fb18cdcf41a2972371e; 4bcf2c380f71b900d9f80f96300c841e63752b6c; 34b218dec8a12e1e67ef8a1dad7561878943ce72; 78ebd1ca91faed677357e438ed32af9f873d1075; 949425cd010784f571d7b2b75780b9beb341be12; 2679cb2f07a56ef54b67c93fac5df60edde1fb36; bd943258706db5796bd8b6de5f32eb329d9bea33; 55b192dec3c0470042e372ccef58a7a74565b08a; 33cd1515f1bf568fed6869d548c9af8e477a2cf3; c1a7bf649d1e380ea5fefc468042c5211b85a442; fb1914ca0364765309bf172522655adeb5fa5143; 51f1051f84f1b8358236143e100aef1816e50488; dd04ce44c29ee94d02eeab3acd9a2c5288bf6c3b; 292ac6b46bb195075ae4955c1d0ec2aee6d9a5dd; 78413a3882b803f9422260098e28f998d962f335; 33583bbbc205b81a2330e84961b5b865a4f2934c; 49a8110c953cd843276a26931ef7087e75796a89; e5e789df8e123026784d3e6eeed928289f41addb; 3fa6fede4ef26b2bdf66b55482eb1e38d60afd1d; 2b6d6b7f00ed80968b3dbb2d10d3fd54a99528b2; 814964b5196a91ec406acacc7e2696bad00152f4; 42b70d8c3c9a282a43665d4a0a01d5f1b2e62eb1; 34a3b68d1a57fea6713bb74e1c9aef191c9f16b8,Endocrinology,153 6,"

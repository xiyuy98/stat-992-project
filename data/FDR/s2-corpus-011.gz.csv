93c28e8e2ddeba3219e7c98a3468997fbc495562,Revealing pathway cross-talk related to diabetes mellitus by Monte Carlo Cross-Validation analysis,"Abstract Objective To explore potential functional biomarkers in diabetes mellitus (DM) by utilizing gene pathway cross-talk. Methods Firstly, potential disrupted pathways that were enriched by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified based on biological pathways downloaded from the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) database. In addition, we quantified the pathway crosstalk for each pair of pathways based on Discriminating Score (DS). Random forest (RF) classification was then employed to find the top 10 pairs of pathways with a high area under the curve (AUC) value between DM samples versus normal samples based on 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, a Monte Carlo Cross-Validation was applied to demonstrate the identified pairs of pathways by a mutual information analysis. Results A total of 247 DEGs in normal and disease samples were identified. Based on the F-test, 50 disrupted pathways were obtained with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01. Simultaneously, after calculating the DS, the top 10 pairs of pathways were selected based on a higher AUC value as measured by RF classification. From the Monte Carlo Cross-Validation, we considered the top 10 pairs of pathways with higher AUC values ranked for all 50 bootstraps as the most frequently detected ones. Conclusion The pairs of pathways identified in our study might be key regulators in DM.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Han-Qing Cai"", ids = ""3753615""); list(name = ""Shihong Lv"", ids = ""14101468""); list(name = ""Chun-Jing Shi"", ids = ""90916335"")",,ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; e0149f4926373368a0d88f7fb57c5549500fd83a; af401cac5d2d886fb0a88a4f269e4d958b122c7d; 6002266ec6b9699634483c74026f31f108203fc1; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; c4bd61ed86458af45fd787421b39ec7bf3578f34; 431fd18a16cb2ebca76aa80920a861a4df76a202; bc9c6f96864ade62280522eced3d00186ad60f6a; de005bc7fd9148a89c03841be085656744f4744d; e6d5889a1804df74684c4acab3ad3822ca9f2ea4; 75bef2830db5f74939f012fbb3b9896f29ce4cfe; 81b391818b4318faf76a66d05bc25c6c9ace5343; 5057556e3af4f869d0be8161e84b925015078c33; edbc97bd79022df3101d9a240d1450b2b0b7dc39; 7328c9f813d0f596f21c2adcaff5431570b0e932; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0b665d3450ce5139ac7621d49d5109b275e0ad92; 2746b93accc496c3b302501141e7fb5c8c6be32c; eb6fd4c8770f944f9edc529917da2e4f6a9a44e6; 3bd16cd11f90d8b7717ce67632c9b77d375556d8; 5df849d94d8e1525636de12d2210e41577bb31d3; a238f6043a0a686253a013a6fe71708a0ef46d41,Open Life Sciences,12,473 - 480
66ca239f1a90b7c322df95eba9c1c623a38c6c1e,The Genetic Architecture of Leukoaraiosis and Cognitive Function.,"Subcortical white matter hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, referred to as leukoaraiosis, is associated with increased risk of stroke and dementia. Hypertension may contribute to leukoaraiosis by accelerating the process of arteriosclerosis involving penetrating small arteries and arterioles in the brain. Leukoaraiosis volume is highly heritable but shows significant inter-individual variability that is not predicted well by any clinical covariates (except for age) or by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). As part of the Genetics of Microangiopathic Brain Injury (GMBI) Study, 777 individuals (74% hypertensive) underwent brain MRI and were genotyped for 1649 SNPs from genes known or hypothesized to be involved in arteriosclerosis and related pathways. We examined SNP main effects, epistatic (genegene) interactions, and context-dependent (gene-environment) interactions between these SNPs and covariates (including conventional and novel risk factors for arteriosclerosis) for association with leukoaraiosis volume. Three methods were used to reduce the chance of false positive associations: 1) false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing, 2) an internal replication design, and 3) a ten-iteration four-fold cross-validation * This work was previously published as Smith JA, Turner ST, Sun YV, Fornage M, Kelly RJ, Mosley T, Jack CR, Kullo IJ, Kardia SLR. (2009). Complexity in the Genetic Architecture of Leukoaraiosis in Hypertensive Sibships from the GENOA Study. BMC Medical Genomics 2(1): 16. 59 scheme. Four SNP main effects (in F3, KITLG, CAPN10, and MMP2), 12 SNP-covariate interactions (including interactions between KITLG and homocysteine, and between TGFB3 and both physical activity and C reactive protein), and 173 SNP-SNP interactions were significant, replicated, and cross-validated. While a model containing the top single SNPs with main effects predicted only 3.87% variation in leukoaraiosis in independent test samples, a multiple variable model that included the four most highly predictive SNP-SNP and SNP-covariate interactions predicted 11.83%. These results indicate that the genetic architecture of leukoaraiosis is complex, yet predictive, when the contributions of SNP main effects are considered in combination with effects of SNP interactions with other genes and covariates.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Jennifer Ann Smith"", ids = ""48600365"")",,0c25179d692040f6ee540358eb7a4650d1e5d631; 0f07c69cde4ee6f453fa22f449347b470395d53f; 6d718b70302530ffa1783054ca5de8748ccae75d; 1b6cc0a567e26b5499ead9c7a02e40e61c6893b8; 3ca8e75a2bd6cd03ef1ac0d91c2417feab17ec4a; 8199883a71330c0d92583370113619b31829f44b; 817166a774fca80b2391e419a03dcc5bd528f0d8; 19f996d1de3d52797f438440b06c887c508a0535; 36ab1c68901aa032d83983195df99559176bd8d7; d4d5f47e7dd403247ac4e16bd743b884cd4b099f; a3629e09b051214e3c78f268be324482757c3c43; 05119aa899b8ec0a4850e018a3ba0411c45ae88b; 861de4539f59dc7535c73c33f063c2ab5226bb3c; 5384d03ae191ffdaa53e6d690485e0fa67985759; 09388de3a2ac5ffe4f909a23d383e1647f655933; f14f75a56b1891100d84ed02537e0de92c1dea1c; 3825f6cab2a56f8e486f82b6c4de532a23e6985b; 2af4fcb3833ba49c9bc9b48bb4a1d1b9389f137f; bb16d57f4a4719a1006183532a74e02957694257; 2c4a06641330dcbcb8069d644807e772d934e010; 3e4c1c280f66b9005834eb1234b3bdfd2da85319; ba6a14bc42d8e75ce1215df8bd3fff81e642e1ce; 90508e6389394acb42cdbde9700cac231c705db0; 4096cb86feae7f96c35ae3ae410e18cdca33bef4; c9a3bc1cb4c6341fd01ec38f963ef54c546032d9; 0500db3e5fde372f011ca8246e7f203e3268d471; c6f147a480f1f1e1e89bdf36ce9d8014df981346; dbdbf11656c7d5c89438d82dbad5f754aa7c7d45; ade2759a53bea3ed1550677016884be58fc362bb; 4545d66a1b1d0010f3e4bafd20920e41b2faa556; a065fa6a8aff2649673e7405ccc362aed0d9f73f; 77599733944f5fd23771cee93d0f9cc19963fa30; d46127baf85a472c1c3839fa76e5d5f9aba97720; 7b28610d2d681a11398eb614de0d70d7de41c20c; cef7340fe4d3ee0a0deae5d8e2e8546fc708bb76; d693ffcbd012393ade6725277207dbdef14d34dc; 85eaa02458e2eee61e440dc2260c2f8744af7f10; ee851cf24d3a7c401d246c888d224cbc71bd6aa5; 2691a9f08688209247548b4897eb0f5c1ae4cb58; 6509bb3fa51a968c64f6a8fc4104b828c78517c9; dfd002c9a49db1363e457305c598bbd27df525e1; c1ab09ac696b6388788df419753ac1a71e545fec; 14e314b0727576d70f519da253d7d28b559cb9dd; f753629718276e730024cc403a839f2cf6b493c0; 4f7f82f05b1a4207e8c77599340078fd67b71dd3; 9a5c9cfa4e98d6d47b95e9643043431b239e950a; 77013a15aa32c3d45d05c1fd6379326df6f567e4; f76d14d44666bdc8c38f4b696a2199e5457bd9b1; 1ed7b0fc5b680b71c4f271c63c8e0c55a7d3b9ec; 622417ac2e9058868b97c078a6ac5985ee16eaf3; 03cbf237dfbd3e0bb92626e73023fe7571e72543; 219c346b8c777ef9b80b0613b0fb926caf1e2289; 30c7b8df8fa3331ba532f80fe0b1dbc24309c7fa; 2dc79119fda170ecf2df2487a19f2ac56722c6e7; 44c406f43660c6d96ef65365ddecab3b8ef982ad; c41d207c3ea20d6a310ff8d138cc1f303dff51b7,,,
ec9e1cc439425dc385783d2176fe3e857f523fd2,"Neocortical thinning in ""benign"" mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.","PURPOSE
In refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) extrahippocampal and neocortical abnormalities have been described in patients with or without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Recently we observed gray matter reductions in regions outside the hippocampus in benign MTLE with or without MTS. Cortical thickness has been proposed as a viable methodologic alternative for assessment of neuropathologic changes in extratemporal regions. Herein, we aimed to use this technique to describe cortical abnormalities in patients with benign TLE.


METHODS
Whole-brain cortical thickness analysis (FreeSurfer) was performed in 32 unrelated patients with benign TLE [16 patients with signs of MTS on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pMTLE; 16 without, nMTLE] and 44 healthy controls.


KEY FINDINGS
In the pMTLE group, the most significant thinning was found in the sensorimotor cortex bilaterally but was more extensive in the left hemisphere (false discovery rate, p < 0.05). Other areas were localized in the occipital cortex, left supramarginal gyrus, left superior parietal gyrus, left paracentral sulcus, left inferior/middle/superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal sulcus, right cingulate cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal gyrus, right fusiform gyrus, and cuneus/precuneus. In the nMTLE, a similar neurodegenerative pattern was detected, although not surviving correction for multiple comparisons. Direct comparison between pMTLE and nMTLE did not reveal significant changes.


SIGNIFICANCE
Patients with either benign pMTLE or nMTLE showed comparable cortical thinning, mainly confined to the sensorimotor cortex. This finding that is not appreciated on routine MRI supports the hypothesis that similar to refractory MTLE, even in benign MTLE, pathology in neocortical regions maybe implicated in the pathophysiology of this syndrome.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Angelo Labate"", ids = ""4172366""); list(name = ""Antonio Cerasa"", ids = ""1685733""); list(name = ""Umberto Aguglia"", ids = ""2675418""); list(name = ""Laura Mumoli"", ids = ""4676798""); list(name = ""Aldo Quattrone"", ids = ""2321981""); list(name = ""Antonio Gambardella"", ids = ""145477106"")",236eed9a74a7d859f965408c23d68d97e11e26b5; d599b0b1b9dee772bc77d50845fda0a7cc8a37ea; 05edbce9adaec7a1eaec95441c9df2ec9da03103; 5eeeba0343c54188823aa0d3a27798855d857149; 5c1e8f88757a46ab2d42d97f0338218c5870e4a1; 675ea2bf7d7878dc629b4cd99e223fcdbbcac6f8; a6e1fa88ca2163624bb33c51ec9d4075fbb03eb4; 8040c64c2c0e1e0375a3218bf1a87e76f5f23202; f2720bac85f22579fac924b60352e292e7a87e1a; 7e13aec8ff7240a451160b66d1fe4cdabe5d3b7f; 5487c4ee8cdfa94f811819d8c5781a7d4344d3ad; 7215bd4a94c82d95a0fded3f8def0d7ec32c3054; 0f2d92b34b05318eef69ba91714b7703fdcc0ce4; 723227fc693e73152e87f19a1c93e605e62b4f43; 5ed8b86aaadbf0938f2c06208617503617aae04c; af4860cfa3d5a5e943c22ba5c9119bd640d9bf41; a945b3ee44dd0f3ffb36605c6e995bd9428491a4; 4fb303830f5897eae611f731f26acf8a9df992f8; 64048b3cf82f7345221c1e1777b821956007ed66; 08c87167152a32ba19a3504d3227f242c6c6847f; 0c279aee31df2dbf89daa1630f92307c8e5610fd; 68533ed2db3a0d5af6ce0c4fcd0601ec0284517e; 7fd4a781ab5a236a35a0c0ba2a5939681ab8076c; b4661dfdebf49a4bd9f03e33a963d37eb13439c6; 9c95eedb5054a1097839a30a11496da43f212e9a; dc89fcd10d64bca86ae6a06cfff289736e8aa3b9; b83944c4baf90c3b10253fe4a45b7cc4a3256cbb; ffb5ecdfdea6838772409a7738c280297d976e24; c3295e2e1c22395724f5f8493f6236c3bb06048d; c34994b0cb0a4eeb60a758bfa3b6c198f6d0b21a; 83d855a9950f086b75d46bf82740b03bcb961623; c705ff5dc5bd38a70d3b8cf636b936dc6ff99a4d,,Epilepsia,52 4,"

0f5ed44a19d4d06649aa955964c7bbff5bc04331,Mining gold dust under the genome wide significance level: a two-stage approach to analysis of GWAS.,"We propose a two-stage approach to analyze genome-wide association data in order to identify a set of promising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In stage one, we select a list of top signals from single SNP analyses by controlling false discovery rate. In stage two, we use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to reduce false positives. The proposed approach was evaluated using simulated quantitative traits based on genome-wide SNP data on 8,861 Caucasian individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Our first stage, targeted at controlling false negatives, yields better power than using Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The LASSO regression reduces the number of significant SNPs in stage two: it reduces false-positive SNPs and it reduces true-positive SNPs also at simulated causal loci due to linkage disequilibrium. Interestingly, the LASSO regression preserves the power from stage one, i.e., the number of causal loci detected from the LASSO regression in stage two is almost the same as in stage one, while reducing false positives further. Real data on systolic blood pressure in the ARIC study was analyzed using our two-stage approach which identified two significant SNPs, one of which was reported to be genome-significant in a meta-analysis containing a much larger sample size. On the other hand, a single SNP association scan did not yield any significant results.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gang Shi"", ids = ""48745135""); list(name = ""Eric Boerwinkle"", ids = ""2918432""); list(name = ""Alanna C.

f7c0209a78ee38875f8c385374d12f287d55a522,Mass fingerprinting of complex mixtures: protein inference from high-resolution peptide masses and predicted retention times.,"In typical shotgun experiments, the mass spectrometer records the masses of a large set of ionized analytes but fragments only a fraction of them. In the subsequent analyses, normally only the fragmented ions are used to compile a set of peptide identifications, while the unfragmented ones are disregarded. In this work, we show how the unfragmented ions, here denoted MS1-features, can be used to increase the confidence of the proteins identified in shotgun experiments. Specifically, we propose the usage of in silico mass tags, where the observed MS1-features are matched against de novo predicted masses and retention times for all peptides derived from a sequence database. We present a statistical model to assign protein-level probabilities based on the MS1-features and combine this data with the fragmentation spectra. Our approach was evaluated for two triplicate data sets from yeast and human, respectively, leading to up to 7% more protein identifications at a fixed protein-level false discovery rate of 1%. The additional protein identifications were validated both in the context of the mass spectrometry data and by examining their estimated transcript levels generated using RNA-Seq.

a7d55423092f4f242956030e1181ddf52c1c264c,PTSD and Romantic Relationship Satisfaction: Cluster- and Symptom-Level Analyses.,"Previous studies have demonstrated bidirectional associations between posttraumatric stress disorder (PTSD) and romantic relationship dissatisfaction. Most of these studies were focused at the level of the disorder, examining the association between relationship dissatisfaction and having a diagnosis of PTSD or the total of PTSD symptoms endorsed. This disorder-level approach is problematic for trauma theorists who posit symptom-level mechanisms for these effects. In the present study, we examined the prospective, bidirectional associations between PTSD symptom clusters (e.g., reexperiencing) and relationship satisfaction using the data from 101 previously studied individuals who had had a recent motor vehicle accident. We also conducted exploratory analyses examining the prospective, bidirectional associations between individual PTSD symptoms and relationship satisfaction. Participants had completed the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and the Relationship Assessment Scale at 4, 10, and 16 weeks after the MVA. We performed time-lagged mixed-effects regressions to examine the effect of lagged relationship satisfaction on PTSD clusters and symptoms, and vice versa. No cluster effects were significant after controlling for a false discovery rate. Relationship satisfaction predicted prospective decreases in reliving the trauma (d = 0.42), emotional numbness (d = 0.46), and irritability (d = 0.49). These findings were consistent with the position that relationship satisfaction affects PTSD through symptom-level mechanisms.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicole J LeBlanc"", ids = ""39784902""); list(name = ""Louise Dixon"", ids = ""47672015""); list(name = ""Donald J.

Insulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), it is often accompanied by defective beta-cell function (BF) and is involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Commonalities among these traits may recognize a genetic background, possibly involving the genetic variation of insulin signaling pathway genes. We conducted an exploratory analysis by testing whether common genetic variability at IRS1, ENPP1 and TRIB3 loci is associated with cardiovascular risk traits and metabolic phenotypes in T2DM.


METHODS AND RESULTS
In 597 drug-naÃ¯ve, GADA-negative, newly-diagnosed T2DM patients we performed: 1) genotyping of 10 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering âˆ¼ 90% of common variability at IRS1, ENPP1 and TRIB3 loci; 2) carotid artery ultrasound; 3) standard ECG (n = 450); 4) euglycaemic insulin clamp to assess insulin sensitivity; 5) 75 g-OGTT to estimate BF (derivative and proportional control) by mathematical modeling. False discovery rate of multiple comparisons was set at 0.20. After adjustment for age, sex and smoking status, rs4675095-T (IRS1) and rs4897549-A (ENPP1) were significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis severity, whilst rs7265169-A (TRIB3) was associated with ECG abnormalities. Rs858340-G (ENPP1) was significantly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, independently of age, sex and body-mass-index. No consistent relationships were found with BF.


CONCLUSION
Some associations were found between intermediate phenotypes of CVD and common genetic variation of gatekeepers along the insulin signaling pathway. These results need be replicated to support the concept that in T2DM the CVD genetic risk clock may start ticking long before hyperglycemia appears.

99ccb3cb38209dd60e06527f8c578446d7c70d88,A hierarchical Bayesian approach to multiple testing in disease mapping,"We propose a Bayesian approach to multiple testing in disease mapping. This study was motivated by a real example regarding the mortality rate for lung cancer, males, in the Tuscan region (Italy). The data are relative to the period 1995-1999 for 287 municipalities. We develop a tri-level hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate for each area the posterior classification probability that is the posterior probability that the municipality belongs to the set of non-divergent areas. We show also the connections of our model with the false discovery rate approach. Posterior classification probabilities are used to explore areas at divergent risk from the reference while controlling for multiple testing. We consider both the Poisson-Gamma and the Besag, York and MolliÃ© model to account for extra Poisson variability in our Bayesian formulation. Posterior inference on classification probabilities is highly dependent on the choice of the prior. We perform a sensitivity analysis and suggest how to rely on subject-specific information to derive informative a priori distributions. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a sensible way to model classification probabilities in the context of disease mapping.",2010,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dolores Catelan"", ids = ""2733230""); list(name = ""Corrado Lagazio"", ids = ""2156196""); list(name = ""Annibale Biggeri"", ids = ""2595514"")",6f5407ea675821c07e1274b6b6755c4879b1f03d; fd366aae5780b1385eb2acf075160bd97a96c131; d96e0c0b20c6f2802f2993348b6e7af4b088eacd; 9c878593318d379b8d890abdb4550dd78bfa27e2; 04020c271f9b637ff4077bc30796578749863035; 9de63ce64503f856bad7c2b4ac9ef565d5214756; ee7de34ee5bb87943ce9ad3faa4cea955fe518be; 492d2840edf047a8915ba0f9728605122ab55fbc; 8da0fd644a9b4335ae60478aad2a5f4c765baa7b; 985fc2bce6d4001d3ecb2645f7faf5e84178677a; 5a5b2b83ef6d3cc489982e30a9677aa9db65ae02; 2f93de4a45bcb624ab6d7ebc415f2df272540293; 976408e4a575f244c87e597bcb2ff5dbb4673489; b8d987efab0803521ed0db581024d2cf1b091a86; 35fe9b4ca1d4b64d5bd71b53c5d667e8a276f620,308a917ff897dc9cac41302f6876639847189d9b; bf5ecd1aa52d511f1c6b6f54267f40ebe13b10fd; 9eb659bd6156af45c781316dc1d282b2b36fd536; 86dd743c8408f216a3b40f47a9236872cd433423; a1eff280374dc4ed72c39eba5332fbbe9ce54f53; 66be81f765a825940748f6eb54b63a64ff972e7b; 604f9541a28bdcd56f2e69e3b6044e78e319d51e; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; f406770d7bfd1869529c5f698ca5750efbd784de; 0043a30db212b3b4c1b8821e11f86ed28b7655fa; bf0695f62bad508f9fc842ddcfdfa2f79c3ff984; a03203d0e52269a42d9cd9cbadaa2b384cc6e353; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; 845ac61443b4da894258e9572989ec724adf782e; 600d99d9959578a81d611678964b7a4f8cb75730; f327a3ec3fd438aa8760c0eccac4b7f79d267b7b; 7e6ec081f025f9bdf22f191859031629290dca84; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 69965ca17377c37f643f6bfad2599937aa521e74; 374a1b0cfa470d34d3244a6f5686c87531f74168; 114b9807ee608db1c56133bbe4a1f188f195f9e4; 47f4b51e66d19fdc8feef5421aeb89f72acf44a3; 46848e4c1c0d71681ad72d39e983b28984cfef04; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; e685ec3d217648dd25e581c5c5fc6f8ad62e0685; 6e4ef9da13090e66d28019b64a886041cb0428e5; a94664b9abce5eecd51d66de79f07c242df3eadc; ed831e9c931f82488374629e3245008cff4bcb53; 2654aca501e6bdfeefa5fc06ca251395815c9060; 4bbad18ca19d35174737291177673daaae4ee52b; b4d972cd8a6503f6066986d38d321101cd250bce; df851d9b937aa7a3f00e8232c1485fba60fff996; 14ae79f1e13b94b156a54ad746e22e849f6e9409; 1ed5fe7891d9ae6de014440ff046d6d7285ea367; 9c67f30235a47e305dc57c9f185d5587faca4236; 977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 6e23b50dd677d493f2ee182244372fc7e0fbb9ae; 8483a33eaf790c39f1625e8b330d9920067c27af; 08b355c3143f9e7fd454a560f9fb11636eeb6906; 6b9f7f214abbe504b8ba69be77c030eb1fc44412; a0acfc2e7fe95d69d6f93443201202203eb2af92; 59ac99583c8c5ec9de91932ce2397baf81e84f4d; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; f94defcf16bf4a8e779f9ae7b5ad870c8da34c4a; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c,Biometrical Journal.

2461c1062448ffabebf3effd52333a190ac76804,Microarray analysis of the primate luteal transcriptome during chorionic gonadotrophin administration simulating early pregnancy.,"To explore chorionic gonadotrophin (CG)-regulated gene expression in the primate corpus luteum (CL), adult female rhesus macaques were treated in a model of simulated early pregnancy (SEP). Total RNA was isolated from individual CL after specific intervals of exposure (1, 3, 6 and 9 days) to recombinant hCG in vivo and hybridized to Affymetrixâ„¢ GeneChip Rhesus Macaque Genome Arrays. The mRNA levels of 1192 transcripts changed â‰¥2-fold [one-way ANOVA, false discovery rate (FDR) correction; P< 0.05] during SEP when compared with Day 10 untreated controls. Real-time PCR validation indicated that 15 of 17 genes matched in expression pattern between PCR and microarray. Protein levels of three genes identified as CG-sensitive, CYP19A1 (aromatase), PGRMC1 (progestin-binding protein) and STAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) were quantified by western blot analysis. To further analyze global changes in gene expression induced by CG exposure, luteal gene expression was compared between SEP (rescued) and regressing CL, utilizing previously banked GeneChip data from the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Expression patterns and mRNA levels were analyzed between time-matched intervals. Transcripts for 7677 mRNAs differed in expression patterns â‰¥2-fold (one-way ANOVA, FDR correction; P< 0.05) between the hCG-exposed (SEP) CL and regressing CL. Regressed CL (at menses) were most unlike all other CL. Pathway analysis of significantly affected transcripts was performed; the pathway most impacted by CG exposure was steroid biosynthesis. Further comparisons of the genome-wide changes in luteal gene expression during CG rescue and luteolysis in the natural menstrual cycle should identify additional key regulatory pathways promoting primate fertility.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Cecily V.

0146ead6928cb3d4fe005d92210e5dd8f7bd2abe,Glucocorticoid-induced changes in gene expression of airway smooth muscle in patients with asthma.,"RATIONALE
Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of asthma therapy. However, it is unclear whether the benefits of glucocorticoids in asthma are merely based on antiinflammatory properties. Glucocorticoids may also alter gene expression of airway smooth muscle (ASM). We hypothesized that the gene expression profile of the ASM layer in endobronchial biopsies of patients with asthma is altered by oral glucocorticoid therapy as compared with placebo.


OBJECTIVES
First, we investigated the change in ASM transcriptomic profile in endobronchial biopsies after 14 days of oral glucocorticoid therapy. Second, we investigated the association between changes in ASM transcriptomic profile and lung function.


METHODS
Twelve steroid-free patients with atopic asthma were included in this double-blind intervention study. Endobronchial biopsies were taken before and after 14 days of oral prednisolone (n = 6) or placebo (n = 6). RNA of laser-dissected ASM was sequenced (RNA-Seq) using GS FLX+ (454/Roche). Gene networks were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RNA-Seq reads were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution. At the current sample size the estimated false discovery rate was approximately 3%.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Fifteen genes were significantly changed by 14 days of oral prednisolone. Two of these genes (FAM129A, SYNPO2) were associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% drop in FEV1: r = -0.740, P < 0.01; r = -0.746, P < 0.01). Pathway analysis revealed three gene networks that were associated with cellular functions including cellular growth, proliferation, and development.


CONCLUSIONS
Oral prednisolone changes the transcriptomic profile of the ASM layer in asthma.

Recent studies have shown that associations between common genetic variation and gene expression in breast tumors provide insight into the functional mechanisms underlying breast cancer risk loci. However, the relationship between genetic variation, gene expression, and risk of triple negative (TN) breast cancer remains largely unexplored. We performed a genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of TN breast cancer using 668 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded TN tumors from the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Consortium (TNBCC) to identify novel genes relevant to TN breast cancer risk and to further explore the biology underlying known TN risk loci. Cis-eQTLs were defined as correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and expression of genes within 1Mb, and trans-eQTLs were defined as the remainder of all SNP-gene correlations. In a genome-wide analysis, we identified 68,012 cis-eQTLs, representing correlations between 42,193 SNPs and 2,092 genes that were significant at a 10% false discovery rate (FDR). We also identified 70 trans-eQTLs across two unique genes at the same FDR threshold. Five cis-eQTLs involved SNPs previously associated with TN breast cancer risk (p<5.0x10-5) in 3,700 TN cases and 4,700 controls from the TNBCC. Three of these, located on chromosomes 5p (cis-eQTL p=4.8x10-34; risk p=1.1x10-7), 7p (cis-eQTL p=6.1x10-10; risk p=1.3x10-7), and 17q (cis-eQTL p=1.8x10-15; risk p=2.9x10-7), have previously been reported in public databases of normal tissue. The remaining two TN breast cancer cis-eQTLs, located on chromosomes 8q (cis-eQTL p=6.3x10-6, risk p=8.3x10-6) and 14q (cis-eQTL p=3.1x10-6, risk p=1.2x10-5), have not been reported as eQTLs in other tissues. In addition, 12 of 25 known TN breast cancer risk loci (PEX14, MDM4, 2q31.1, ESR1, 11q13.1, 11q24.3, 12p13.1, PTHLH, NTN4, 12q24, 19p13.1, MLK1), contained at least one significant cis-eQTL. In summary, we have identified five cis-eQTLs that may identify novel risk loci for TN breast cancer.

Attempts to determine the clinical significance of BRCA1/2 mutations in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the relationships between BRCA1/2 deficiency (ie, mutation and promoter hypermethylation) and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), chemotherapy response, and whole-exome mutation rate in ovarian cancer.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS
Observational study of multidimensional genomics and clinical data on 316 high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases that were made public between 2009 and 2010 via The Cancer Genome Atlas project.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
OS and PFS rates (primary outcomes) and chemotherapy response (secondary outcome).


RESULTS
BRCA2 mutations (29 cases) were associated with significantly better OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16-0.69; P = .003 and 5-year OS, 61% for BRCA2-mutated vs 25% for BRCA wild-type cases) and PFS (adjusted HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; P = .004 and 3-year PFS, 44% for BRCA2-mutated vs 16% for BRCA wild-type cases), whereas neither BRCA1 mutations (37 cases) nor BRCA1 methylation (33 cases) was associated with prognosis. Moreover, BRCA2 mutations were associated with a significantly higher primary chemotherapy sensitivity rate (100% for BRCA2-mutated vs 82% [P = .02] and 80% [P = .05] for BRCA wild-type and BRCA1-mutated cases, respectively) and longer platinum-free duration (median platinum-free duration, 18.0 months for BRCA2-mutated vs 11.7 [P = .02] and 12.5 [P = .04] months for BRCA wild-type and BRCA1-mutated cases, respectively). BRCA2-mutated, but not BRCA1-mutated cases, exhibited a ""mutator phenotype"" by containing significantly more mutations than BRCA wild-type cases across the whole exome (median mutation number per sample, 84 for BRCA2-mutated vs 52 for BRCA wild-type cases, false discovery rate <0.1).


CONCLUSION
Among women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, BRCA2 mutation, but not BRCA1 deficiency, was associated with improved survival, improved chemotherapy response, and genome instability compared with BRCA wild-type.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Da Yang"", ids = ""145279122""); list(name = ""Sofia Khan"", ids = ""46883458""); list(name = ""Yan Sun"", ids = ""48186096""); list(name = ""Kenneth R.

In this paper, we use a Fourier-Mellin transform-based image registration method to compensate for camera motion before applying temporal differencing for motion detection. The approach is evaluated online as well as offline on a set of sequences recorded with a Care-O-bot 3, and compared with a feature-based method for image registration. In comparison to the feature-based method, our method performs better both in terms of robustness of the registration and the false discovery rate.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Santosh Thoduka"", ids = ""20720551""); list(name = ""Frederik Hegger"", ids = ""1797444""); list(name = ""Gerhard K.

Shaffer (J. Statist. Plann. Inference 82 (1999) 197) provides a recent example. We show that minimizing the Bayes risk for a per-comparison â€œ0â€“1â€ loss function also controls a random effects version of the false discovery rate, thus supporting and extending Shaffer's results.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Charles Lewis"", ids = ""47004998""); list(name = ""Dorothy T.

In current researches of shotgun proteomics, peptides with various PTMs and those without PTMs are often identified together and an overall false discovery rate (FDR) is estimated. However, it is often the case that only a subset of identifications, e.g. those with specific PTMs, are emphasized or reported. In doing so, the risk arises that the FDR of reported results is seriously underor overestimated, based on which unreliable conclusions may be drawn. But unfortunately, this has not been widely realized in the field, and there is still no agreement on the right way to control the FDR of PTM identifications. As a result, the ostrich policy is commonly adopted wittingly or unwittingly, i.e., a simplistic overall estimate is assumed. This paper, for the first time, proves that the FDRs of various PTM identifications are in theory not equivalent to the overall FDR and quantifies several major factors influencing their relationships. Elaborate simulation experiments are carried out to empirically verify the theoretical conclusions. Strategies are suggested for better control of PTM FDRs.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""2448476"")",,,Statistics and Its Interface,5,47-59

In this paper we propose a framework for detection of plaque in coronary arteries from cardio vascular magnetic resonance imaging(CMRI). It is a quantitative tool for the assessment of cardiovascular diseases. First, select a region of interest and segment the region of coronary artery using enhanced region based active contour (ERAC). Secondly the centreline extraction and lumen segmentation are integrated to extract the artery centreline using geometric moments and the vessel direction using Hessian matrix and segment the vessel lumen in each slice using ERAC. A boundary searching method is adapted to fine tune the segmented surface in each slice of CMRI image. Third, the soft plaques in the coronary artery are extracted by thresholding the segmented region. Finally a 3D visualization of blood flow in coronary artery is presented and the volume of blood flow is calculated. In the experiments we have employed 22 datasets of CMRI images.

76a35ee1f1e4a14b3ce47329829b25adf098aa66,Effects of Kudoa septempunctata infections in a human intestinal epithelial model (Caco-2): a DNA microarray study.,"Kudoa septempunctata, a myxosporean parasite infecting the trunk muscles of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), is reported to cause food poisoning in humans. The molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of K. septempunctata spores remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examine the molecular basis of such toxicity using DNA microarray analysis of K. septempunctata-inoculated human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). We observed that the transepithelial resistance of the K. septempunctata-inoculated Caco-2 cell monolayers decreased markedly. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the mRNA expression profiles of control and inoculated cells clearly differed. Inflammatory and bacteria-related pathways, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) production and MAPK/NF-kappa B pathway, were enriched. The concentrations of IL-8 and serotonin (5-HT) were higher in inoculated cells than in controls. K. septempunctata invasion damages the human intestinal epithelium, causing increased production of IL-8 and 5-HT, which likely results in the vomiting associated with K. septempunctata invasion.Abbreviations: AP-1: activator protein 1; DAVID: Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery; ENS: enteric nervous system; FARMS: Factor Analysis for Robust Microarray Summarization; FDR: false discovery rate; GO: Gene Ontology; 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine; IL-8: Interleukin-8; KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; K. septempunctata: Kudoa septempunctata; NF-kappa B: nuclear factor-kappa B; TJ: tight junction; TER: transepithelial electrical resistance.",2020,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""So Yamamoto"", ids = ""3105116""); list(name = ""Fumi Kawano"", ids = ""144806853""); list(name = ""Hiroshi Yokoyama"", ids = ""40410291""); list(name = ""Shoko Kobayashi"", ids = ""46966106"")",,,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",,"

1cd0eab051f90da655f158bb76f5554c41afa852,Determination of the regulated genes in microarray experiments using local FDR,"Background: Thousands of genes in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, for detecting differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments. The expected proportion of false positive genes in a set of genes, called the False Discovery Rate (FDR), has been proposed to measure the statistical significance of this set. Various procedures exist for controlling the FDR. However the threshold (generally 5%) is arbitrary and a specific measure associated with each gene would be worthwhile. Results: Using process intensity estimation methods, we define and give estimates of the local FDR, which may be considered as the probability for a gene to be a false positive. After a global assessment rule controlling the false positive error, the local FDR is a valuable guideline for deciding wether a gene is differentially expressed. The interest of the method is illustrated on three well known data sets. A R routine for computing local FDR estimates from p-values is available at http:/ /www.inapg.fr/ens_rech/mathinfo/recherche/mathematique/outil.html. Conclusions: The local FDR associated with each gene measures the probability that it is a false positive. It gives the opportunity to compute the FDR of any given group of clones (of the same gene) or genes pertaining to the same regulation network or the same chromosomic region.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Julie Aubert"", ids = ""46348653""); list(name = ""Avner Bar-Hen"", ids = ""1398163979""); list(name = ""Jean-Jacques Daudin"", ids = ""145458577""); list(name = ""StÃ©phane Robin"", ids = ""143941011"")",28a64cf5b569ede94dc2eaf242f1f23381145575,b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 4d76918f7f0ecb9b1940c716ed80dea2d07ce223; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,,,
ba921d6a0c77cf9ee676779a0be8589c9453d879,Abstract A131: Identification of candidate therapeutic targets in mesenchymal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Targeted therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is currently limited to EGFR inhibition with agents such as cetuximab. We and others have previously demonstrated that epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC and lung cancers but greater sensitivity to other targeted drugs, such as AXL inhibitors. Here, we apply a previously published EMT signature to identify novel potential therapeutic targets (PTTs) in mesenchymal HNSCC tumors (MHNTs).

Methods: A high-throughput analysis of gene and protein expression in HNSCC tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (A, n=113) was performed to identify PTTs in MHNTs. Specifically, the EMT signature score for each tumor was correlated with marker expression levels by Pearson correlation (mRNA, protein) or t-test (mutation, HPV status). PTTs were validated in an independent cohort of high-risk, resected tumors (B, n=105) and HNSCC cell lines (C, n=60). PTTs were defined as druggable targets found on recent HNSCC publications, our in-house targeted sequencing panel of 202 genes and publicly available cancer cell lines drug sensitivity datasets (DSDs).

Results: At a false discovery rate of 1% (p 0.5) and confirmed in our independent cohort included DDR2, FGFR1, KDR, MMP14, MMP2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and TGFBR2. Targets that were overexpressed in both tumors and cell lines included NOTCH4 (A and B p<0.001; C p<0.04), which is known to play a role in EMT, and ABL1 (A and B, p<0.001; C p<0.01). Protein expression data was available for three out of the 36 validated PTTs and confirmed the mRNA findings, with higher protein levels observed for Axl, cKit and PKC-alpha in mesenchymal tumors (cohort A). Using publicly available in vitro DSDs, we then explored whether increased expression of PTTs was associated with greater sensitivity to specific targeted agents. We found increased sensitivity of mesenchymal cell lines, compared with epithelial ones, to FGFR1, PDGFRA and KDR inhibitors, such as ponatinib and pazopanib. Finally, mutational and HPV analysis of the TCGA cohort showed that mesenchymal tumors had higher rates of TP53 (p=0.044) and RSAP58 (p=0.029) mutations and infrequent PIK3CA or NSD1 mutations (p<0.001 for both). They were predominantly HPV-negative (p=0.024).

Conclusions: An integrated analysis of EMT and expression data from two independent cohorts identifies previously unrecognized, candidate PTTs in mesenchymal HNSCC tumors. Validation of the PTTs at the protein level is ongoing. The approach described may identify patient subsets, beyond mutational status, for whom targeted therapy can be successful.

435f0a776c55935b7386abd5c04a53625286927c,A learned comparative expression measure for Affymetrix genechip DNA microarrays,"Perhaps the most common question that a microarray study can ask is, ""Between two given biological conditions, which genes exhibit changed expression levels?"" Existing methods for answering this question either generate a comparative measure based upon a static model, or take an indirect approach, first estimating absolute expression levels and then comparing the estimated levels to one another. We present a method for detecting changes in gene expression between two samples based on data from Affymetrix GeneChips. Using a library of over 200,000 known cases of differential expression, we create a learned comparative expression measure (LCEM) based on classification of probe-level data patterns as changed or unchanged. LCEM uses perfect match probe data only; mismatch probe values did not prove to be useful in this context. LCEM is particularly powerful in the case of small microarry studies, in which a regression-based method such as RMA cannot generalize, and in detecting small expression changes. At the levels of selectivity that are typical in microarray analysis, the LCEM shows a lower false discovery rate than either MAS5 or RMA trained from a single chip. When many chips are available to RMA, LCEM performs better on two out of the three data sets, and nearly as well on the third. Performance of the MAS5 log ratio statistic was notably bad on all datasets.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Will Sheffler"", ids = ""2104424""); list(name = ""Eli Upfal"", ids = ""1735099""); list(name = ""John Sedivy"", ids = ""35262250""); list(name = ""William Stafford Noble"", ids = ""144458655"")",3395894cba530891aa9e66f7f030efe4224691af; d79b48c6199f07a04a679a9739b3cf4f99d19104; 9f58727e91c2d228a5c55f897b68db60d0bf9212,68fd4fb3b55b9ae64530022a1f778be6da6c6921; 0eccc7bb0c1041db9d4a5cc6ffc7621263ad3edf; bc37489e7173c75be152b2fcea35191c68847ab2; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; 2d86e239a9e9741f22be1d8c1feed7a44da1bdc1; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 0bfc4ed9ae47eb750f7258fd09b07ab865e72ae9; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; 2025384ccd81b9cdc084051c284661e4cd750041; d0a47c8c9c4213edd24a120a6912ebc08e348a19; aa0ba124f3a616053515e1a7b147e9a6dccaff55; 385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 3a8e8d1f9dd48e11a14d2301a02e18f6020204ce; b43397d6209b5716a7a9c09487b7c48246dd0d52; c86900fc9f326e9861adc395c7e4be93dcdb8c2c; 17b962f28b984147f5c1dde7a806183b07989db2; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036,2005 IEEE Computational Systems Bioinformatics Conference (CSB'05),,144-154

To examine disease susceptibility variant in Japanese, verified SNPs from the databases, with a minor allele frequency larger than 0.15, were selected at 10-kb intervals across a 19.31-Mb region (20q11.21-13.13), which contained 291 genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4Î± (HNF4Î±). As a result, a total of 1,147 SNPs were genotyped with TaqMan assay using 1,818 Japanese samples. By searching for HNF4Î± as a representative disease-susceptible gene, no variants of HNF4Î± were strongly associated with disease. To identify other genetic variant related with disease, we designed an extensive two-stage association study (725 first and 1,093 second test samples). Although SNP1146 (rs220076) was selected as a landmark within the 19.31Â Mb region, the magnitude of the nominal P value (PÂ =Â 0.0023) was rather weak. Subsequently, a haplotype-based association study showed that two common haplotypes were weakly associated with disease. All of these tests resulted in non-significance after adjusting for Bonferroniâ€™s correction and the false discovery rate to control for the impact of multiple testing. Contrary to the initial expectations, we could not conclude that certain SNPs had a major effect on this promising locus within the framework presented here.

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Is Common in Schizophrenia and Responds Well to Treatment â€“ a Novel and Practical Means to Improve Cognition and Metabolic Health?,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference S284 Poster Session II size of 3 mm3, smoothed with an 8 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel using SPM 5. The GLM approach implemented in SPM 5 was utilized for fMRI data modeling and analyses. Each epoch type (zero-back, two-back and rest) was modeled in a boxcar design, using a canonical hemodynamic response function and its temporal derivative. The single group second level analysis consisted of voxelwise one-sample t-tests with significance threshold set at voxel level p < .05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected for multiple comparisons across the entire brain. The between-group comparison employed voxelwise two sample t-tests with the significance criterion based on the spatial extent of suprathreshold voxel clusters, a method proposed by (Friston et al., 1994). The criterion for inclusion of a voxel in a cluster was set at p < .05 (uncorrected) and a cluster was considered as significant at level of p < .05 (corrected). Results: Patients exhibited relatively high general function and mild symptoms, but had significantly longer reaction time and decline in performance. Both controls and patients activated similar set of brain regions similar to Central executive network and deactivated brain areas comprising the default mode network. Most noteworthy, we did not find evidence for hypofrontality (reduced activity in DLPFC in patients compared to controls) in this study. Compared to controls, patients showed areas of greater activation in left postcentral gyrus, anterior and posterior medial frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus. Discussion: Both controls and patients showed activation in widespread brain areas consistent with the CEN, and deactivation in areas consistent with DMN regions. There was no evidence of hypofrontality in this sample of remitted people with schizophrenia. Patients showed activation patterns on the zeroback task similar to the activation patterns for controls on the two back task, suggesting that patients showed increased brain activation on a task with lesser requirements, though behavioural results suggest inefficiency despite the increased effort.

STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ALTERATIONS IN THE BRAIN DURING WORKING MEMORY IN MEDICATION-NAÃVE PATIENTS AT CLINICAL HIGH-RISK FOR PSYCHOSIS KolbjÃ¸rn BrÃ¸nnick1, Jens GisselgÃ¥rd2, Inge Joa1, Aase Ingvild1, Robert JÃ¸rgensen1, Jan Olav Johannessen*,1 1TIPS â€“ Centre for Clinical Research in Psychosis, Stavanger University Hospital; 2Stavanger University Hospital Background: The pre-TIPS study in 1994â€“95 showed that the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was long in our region with a mean value of 2.1 years, and median 26 weeks. This set the stage for the TIPS-study (1997â€“2000), reducing DUP through information campaigns targeted to the general population and other referral agents (GPâ€™s, schools and others) in Rogaland County (Norway). The information campaigns were launched together with a low threshold organization with direct access to an early detection team, for a diagnostic interview and help. The hypothesis was that this could change help seeking behavior, awareness towards psychosis and thus reduce the DUP. The information campaigns and the early detection team were introduced in an early detection(ED) area (Rogaland county, Norway) comparing DUP with two usual-detection control sites in Oslo (Norway) and Roskilde (Denmark). As a result, DUP in the early detection area was reduced from 26 weeks median to 4 weeks median. Symptom and function advantages of early detection and DUP reduction have been demonstrated as being significant throughout the follow-up period. Social and functional outcome have been increasingly emphasized as being key parameters, as these contribute to both quality of life and to financial costs in society. The TIPS program continues to include and follow patients; since the mid 2000â€™s also young people with ultra-high risk states (Prevention of Psychosis; POP) or substance induced psychoses. Previous ultra-high risk studies suggest that psychotic disorders are associated with structural and functional abnormalities within the frontoparietal circuits and that medication status is a potential confounding factor. We investigated neural correlates to ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis in medication-naÃ¯ve patients. Methods: 41 CHR patients and 37 healthy controls were examined with 1.5 Tesla MRI, yielding functional scans while performing an N-back task and structural T1-weighted brain images. Functional and structural data underwent automated preprocessing steps in SPM and Freesurfer, correspondingly. The groups were compared employing mass-univariate strategy within the generalized linear modelling framework. Results: UHR demonstrated reduced suppression of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions during n-back task. We also found that, consistent with previous findings, UHR subjects demonstrated thinning in prefrontal, cingulate, insular and inferior temporal areas, as well as reduced hippocampal volumes. Discussion: The present findings add to the growing evidence of specific structural and functional abnormalities in the brain as potential neuroimaging markers of psychosis vulnerability. F164. VENTRAL AND DORSAL STRIATAL DYSFUNCTION DURING REWARD ANTICIPATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS Marta Stepien1, Andrei Manoliu1, Roman Kubli1, Karoline Schneider1, Philippe N. Tobler2, Erich Seifritz1, Marcus Herdener1, Stefan Kaiser3, Matthias Kirschner*,1 1Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich; 2Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research, University of Zurich; 3Geneva University Hospitals Background: Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia and also found in healthy individuals in subclinical forms. According to the current literature the two negative symptom domains, apathy and diminished expression may have different underlying neural mechanisms. Previous observations suggest that striatal dysfunction is associated with apathy in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether apathy is specifically related to ventral or dorsal striatal alterations. Here, we investigated striatal dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia and a nonclinical population, to determine whether it is a relevant neural correlate for apathy. Methods: Chronic schizophrenia patients (n= 16) and healthy controls (n=23) underwent an eventrelated functional MRI, while performing a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task. The two negative symptom domains were assessed in both groups using the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale. Results: In schizophrenia patients, we saw a strong negative correlation between apathy and ventral and dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation. In contrast, there was no correlation with diminished expression. In healthy controls, global negative symptoms were correlated with decreased dorsal striatal activity. Discussion: This study replicates our previous findings of a correlation between ventral striatal activity and apathy but not diminished expression in chronic schizophrenia patients. The association between apathy and reduced dorsal striatal activity suggests that impaired action-outcome selection is involved in the pathophysiology of motivational deficits. Finally, our findings in healthy controls support the idea that striatal alterations are a plausible neural correlate for negative symptoms in both a clinical and a subclinical context. F165.

While previous studies suggest that both genetic and environmental risks play an important role in the development of early-onset CP, little is known about potential biological processes underlying these associations. In this study, we examined prospective associations between DNA methylation (cord blood at birth) and trajectories of CP (4-13 years), using data drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Methylomic variation at seven loci across the genome (false discovery rate < 0.05) differentiated children who go on to develop early-onset (n = 174) versus low (n = 86) CP, including sites in the vicinity of the monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) gene (involved in endocannabinoid signaling and pain perception). Subthreshold associations in the vicinity of three candidate genes for CP (monoamine oxidase A [MAOA], brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], and FK506 binding protein 5 [FKBP5]) were also identified. Within the early-onset CP group, methylation levels of the identified sites did not distinguish children who will go on to persist versus desist in CP behavior over time. Overall, we found that several of the identified sites correlated with prenatal exposures, and none were linked to known genetic methylation quantitative trait loci.

In recent years, a large number of studies around the world have led to the identification of causal genes for hereditary types of common and rare neurological and psychiatric disorders.


OBJECTIVE
To explore the functional and genomic features of known human genes mutated in neuropsychiatric disorders.


METHODS
A systematic search was used to develop a comprehensive catalog of genes mutated in neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analyses were carried out. A false discovery rate approach was used for correction for multiple testing.


RESULTS
We found several functional categories that are enriched among NPD genes, such as gene ontologies, protein domains, tissue expression, signaling pathways and regulation by brain-expressed miRNAs and transcription factors. Sixty six of those NPD genes are known to be druggable. Several topographic parameters of protein-protein interaction networks and the degree of conservation between orthologous genes were identified as significant among NPD genes.


CONCLUSION

098d35195ddb25537fac71fc2f661107b46a9034,Statistical selection of biological models for genome-wide association analyses,"Genome-wide association studies have discovered many biologically important associations of genes with phenotypes. Typically, genome-wide association analyses formally test the association of each genetic feature (SNP, CNV, etc) with the phenotype of interest and summarize the results with multiplicity-adjusted p-values. However, very small p-values only provide evidence against the null hypothesis of no association without indicating which biological model best explains the observed data. Correctly identifying a specific biological model may improve the scientific interpretation and can be used to more effectively select and design a follow-up validation study. Thus, statistical methodology to identify the correct biological model for a particular genotype-phenotype association can be very useful to investigators. Here, we propose a general statistical method to summarize how accurately each of five biological models (null, additive, dominant, recessive, co-dominant) represents the data observed for each variant in a GWAS study. We show that the new method stringently controls the false discovery rate and asymptotically selects the correct biological model. Simulations of two-stage discovery-validation studies show that the new method has these properties and that its validation power is similar to or exceeds that of simple methods that use the same statistical model for all SNPs. Example analyses of three data sets also highlight these advantages of the new method.

b96102f795d15daf890b1537590463e49331b3cc,Multiplicity Considerations in Clinical Safety Analyses,"Analyses of clinical adverse event (AE) data are routinely summarized using between-group p-values for every AE within each of several body systems. If the p-values are reported and/or interpreted without multiplicity considerations, there is a potential for too many false positive findings. This can needlessly muddy the safety profile of an otherwise safe drug or vaccine. Accordingly, we offer an innovative proposal for tackling multiplicity, one that provides a reasonable balance between no adjustment and over adjustment, and is easy to automate. Our proposal involves a two-step use of adjusted p-values based on the false discovery rate (FDR) methodology of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). Real data from three moderate to large vaccine trials are used to illustrate our proposed â€œDouble FDRâ€ approach and to reinforce the potential impact of failing to account for multiplicity. This work was in collaboration with the late Prof. John Tukey. CONTACT INFORMATION Devan V.

Safety endpoints, or adverse experiences (AEs) typically can be categorized as three types. Tier 1 adverse experiences are those associated with specific hypotheses being tested formally in the clinical trial. Tier 2 AEs would be the set encountered as part of the overall patient safety reporting in the trial. There are usually no hypotheses associated with this set of AEs but the data are collected and reported in a comprehensive manner to allow an overall evaluation of safety. A pvalue or confidence interval estimate of a risk difference or relative risk is reported for each AE encountered in a study. Tier 3 AEs are rare spontaneous reports of serious events that require specific clinical evaluation. The focus of this paper is on the Tier 2 AEs and the issues of multiplicity that need to be considered when interpreting safety data reported in clinical trials. We start with a motivating example using data from a vaccine study and discuss the multiplicity issues that arise with Tier 2 AEs. We then give a brief overview of Familywise Error Rates and False Discovery Rates and propose a method for flagging AEs using objective statistical criteria. The methods are summarized using three vaccine studies. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks. MOTIVATING EXAMPLE A safety and immunogenicity trial of a candidate quadrivalent vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) was conducted in 296 health toddlers, 12 to 18 months of age. Participants were randomly assigned to receive MMRV on day 0 (Group 1) or MMR on day 0 followed by V on day 42 (Group 2). All toddlers received PedvaxHIB on day 0. Safety follow-up used standard AE reporting and the primary question was for local and systemic reactions for the varicella component. This involved a comparison of AEs between Group 1, days 0-42, and Group 2, days 4284. The clinical AE counts for all the Tier 2 AEs are summarized in Table 1 at the end of this paper for the N1 = 148 toddlers and the N2 = 132 toddlers who received a varicella injection. The difference in proportions of toddlers experiencing AEs and a twosided p-value using Fisherâ€™s Exact Test also is provided. Note that 40 different AEs involving 8 different body systems were encountered in this study. Four AEs gave p-values <0.05. MULTIPLICITY ISSUES This example motivates the question of how to report and interpret Tier 2 AEs in clinical trial settings. Clearly, the practice of computing a p-value for each AE has the potential for an excessive number of false positive safety findings if multiplicity is ignored. This can muddy the interpretation of the safety profile of the vaccine/drug. Alternatively, using a Bonferroni type of multiplicity adjustment may mask a true effect. The challenge is to develop a procedure for tackling multiplicity that can provide a proper balance between â€œno adjustmentâ€ and â€œtoo much adjustment.â€ It would be important that the procedure be easy to implement within existing software. In this paper we investigate the use of the False Discovery Rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the American Statistical Association, August 5-9, 2001",2001,Medicine,"list(name = ""Devan V.

This dicotyledonous recretohalophyte has unique morphological characteristics that allow it to tolerate the stress imposed by semi-desert saline soil. However, it is impossible to explore the mechanisms underlying this tolerance without detailed genomic information. Fortunately, newly developed high-throughput sequencing technologies are powerful tools for de novo sequencing to gain such information for this species.ResultsTwo sequencing libraries prepared from control (C21) and NaCl-treated samples (T43) were sequenced using short reads sequencing technology (Illumina) to investigate changes in the R. trigyna transcriptome in response to salt stress. Among 65340 unigenes, 35495 (52.27%) were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms, and metabolic pathways with a cut-off E-value of 10-5. These included 44 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, 119 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and 25 Clusters of Orthologous Groups families. By comparing the transcriptomes from control and NaCl-treated plants, 5032 genes showed significantly differences in transcript abundance under salt stress (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.001 and |log2Ratio| â‰¥ 1). These genes were significantly enriched in 29 KEGG pathways and 26 GO terms. The transcription profiles indicated that genes related to ion transport and the reactive oxygen species scavenging system were relevant to the morphological and physiological characteristics of this species. The expression patterns of 30 randomly selected genes resulted from quantitative real-time PCR were basically consistent with their transcript abundance changes identified by RNA-seq.ConclusionsThe present study identified potential genes involved in salt tolerance of R. trigyna. The globally sequenced genes covered a considerable proportion of the R. trigyna transcriptome. These data represent a genetic resource for the discovery of genes related to salt tolerance in this species, and may be a useful source of reference sequences for closely related taxa. These results can also further our understanding of salt tolerance in other halophytes surviving under sodic stress.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zhen-hua Dang"", ids = ""7994816""); list(name = ""Lin-lin Zheng"", ids = ""152653326"");

14ddeb6cc368931f413f7a51ec27a0690726c5e0,Experiment-specific estimation of peptide identification probabilities using a randomized database.,"Determining the error rate for peptide and protein identification accurately and reliably is necessary to enable evaluation and crosscomparisons of high throughput proteomics experiments. Currently, peptide identification is based either on preset scoring thresholds or on probabilistic models trained on datasets that are often dissimilar to experimental results. The false discovery rates (FDR) and peptide identification probabilities for these preset thresholds or models often vary greatly across different experimental treatments, organisms, or instruments used in specific experiments. To overcome these difficulties, randomized databases have been used to estimate the FDR. However, the cumulative FDR may include low probability identifications when there are a large number of peptide identifications and exclude high probability identifications when there are few. To overcome this logical inconsistency, this study expands the use of randomized databases to generate experiment-specific estimates of peptide identification probabilities. These experiment-specific probabilities are generated by logistic and Loess regression models of the peptide scores obtained from original and reshuffled database matches. These experiment-specific probabilities are shown to very well approximate ""true"" probabilities based on known standard protein mixtures across different experiments. Probabilities generated by the earlier Peptide_Prophet and more recent LIPS models are shown to differ significantly from this study's experiment-specific probabilities, especially for unknown samples. The experiment-specific probabilities reliably estimate the accuracy of peptide identifications and overcome potential logical inconsistencies of the cumulative FDR. This estimation method is demonstrated using a Sequest database search, LIPS model, and a reshuffled database. However, this approach is generally applicable to any search algorithm, peptide scoring, and statistical model when using a randomized database.",2007,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roger Higdon"", ids = ""1735613""); list(name = ""Jason M.

9ec23c4510afce7a30ecb203c82e244be8a4a2cd,MicroRNA profiling of peripheral nerve sheath tumours identifies miR-29c as a tumour suppressor gene involved in tumour progression,"Background:Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common familial diseases, the hallmark of which is the development of multiple neurofibromas. These are benign nerve sheath tumours, which can transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST).Methods:The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in neurofibromas and MPNST obtained from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 using microarray analysis. Differential expression was validated by reverse transcription quantitativeâ€“PCR, and functional studies were performed after transfection of miRNA oligonucleotide mimics into MPNST cells.Results:Sixteen miRNA were significantly differentially expressed in MPNST compared with NF, and of these fourteen were downregulated in MPNST: these included miR-30e*, miR-29c*, miR-29c, miR-340*, miR-30c, miR-139-5p, miR-195, miR-151-5p, miR-342-5p, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-223, let-7 a and let-7â€‰g with a false discovery rate of q=8.48E-03 for the least significant miRNA. In contrast, miR-210 and miR-339-5p were upregulated in MPNST compared with neurofibromas. Prediction softwares/algorithms identified a list of genes targeted by miR-29c including extracellular matrix genes and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, all of which are reported to be involved in cell migration and invasion. Functional studies in a MPNST cell line, sNF96.2, using a mimic of the mature miR-29c showed reduced invasion, whereas there was no change in proliferation. Zymography of the manipulated cells showed that MMP2 activity was also reduced when miR-29c expression was forced in sNF96.2.Conclusion:We provide evidence that reduction of miR-29c has a pivotal role in the progression of nerve sheath tumours and results by increasing the invasive/migratory properties of nerve sheath tumours.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""NadÃ¨ge Presneau"", ids = ""4056452""); list(name = ""Malihe Eskandarpour"", ids = ""50011547""); list(name = ""Tarek A.

776ef4dc07545b0d41968bbc05faa4cc674374fd,Genetic variation and neuroimaging measures in Alzheimer disease.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether genome-wide association study (GWAS)-validated and GWAS-promising candidate loci influence magnetic resonance imaging measures and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) status.


DESIGN
Multicenter case-control study of genetic and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.


SETTING
Multicenter GWAS. Patients A total of 168 individuals with probable AD, 357 with mild cognitive impairment, and 215 cognitively normal control individuals recruited from more than 50 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative centers in the United States and Canada. All study participants had APOE and genome-wide genetic data available.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We investigated the influence of GWAS-validated and GWAS-promising novel AD loci on hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, white matter lesion volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, parahippocampal gyrus thickness, and temporal pole cortex thickness.


RESULTS
Markers at the APOE locus were associated with all phenotypes except white matter lesion volume (all false discovery rate-corrected P values < .001). Novel and established AD loci identified by prior GWASs showed a significant cumulative score-based effect (false discovery rate P = .04) on all analyzed neuroimaging measures. The GWAS-validated variants at the CR1 and PICALM loci and markers at 2 novel loci (BIN1 and CNTN5) showed association with multiple magnetic resonance imaging characteristics (false discovery rate P < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
Loci associated with AD also influence neuroimaging correlates of this disease. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis identified 2 additional loci of high interest for further study.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alessandro Biffi"", ids = ""2214256""); list(name = ""C D Anderson"", ids = ""144776999""); list(name = ""Rahul S.

99dbb735ec9d57cd2e10ac61db95fe11f2f3b811,Differential Gene Expression in Prostate Tissue According to Ejaculation Frequency.,"In a prospective study of 31 925 men with 18 yr of follow-up, higher ejaculation frequency (EF) throughout adulthood was associated with lower rates of prostate cancer. To further explore this association, we evaluated whole transcriptome gene expression in the prostate tissue from study participants who developed prostate cancer between 1992 and 2004 (n=157 tumor tissue, n=85 adjacent normal). We tested for trends in gene expression according to the level of EF as self-reported in 1992 for ages 20-29 yr, 40-49 yr, and the year prior to the questionnaire, 1991. There were no associations between EF and gene expression in areas of tumor after accounting for multiple testing. In contrast, in the adjacent normal tissue, 409 genes and six pathways were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate â‰¤0.2 across categories of EF in 1991. These results suggest that ejaculation affects the expression of genes in the normal prostate tissue. The identified genes and pathways provide potential biological links between EF and prostate tumorigenesis.


PATIENT SUMMARY
To explore previous findings that men who ejaculate more frequently have lower risk of prostate cancer, we evaluated molecular alterations in the prostate tissue according to each man's frequency of ejaculation prior to diagnosis. We identified biological processes that could link ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer A.

ef4912257c6ab6a6da5921e1eea2ae85a199cc1a,Microarray analysis of differential gene expression profiles in blood cells of naturally BLV-infected and uninfected Holsteinâ€“Friesian cows,"The aim of the present study was to examine gene expression changes in response to bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, in an effort to determine genes that take a part in molecular events leading to persistent lymphocytosis (PL), and to better define genes involved in host response to BLV infection. Using bovine 70-mer oligonucleotide spotted microarrays (BLOPlus) and qRT-PCR validation, we studied global gene expression profiles in blood cells in vivo of 12 naturally BLV-infected Polish Holstein cows, and 12 BLV non-infected controls of the same breed and reared in herds with high BLV seroprevalence. With an arbitrary cut-off value of 1.5-fold change in gene expression, we identified the down-regulation of 212 genes (M value â‰¤âˆ’0.585) and the up-regulation of 158 genes (M value of â‰¥0.585) at 1% false discovery rate in BLV-positive animals in comparison to the BLV-negative group. The gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed (DE) genes could be classified to diverse biological processes, including immune response of host blood cells.

28d76ee0f32bd9a90de89deb7807193631e0f4b6,PRISM offers a comprehensive genomic approach to transcription factor function prediction.,"The human genome encodes 1500-2000 different transcription factors (TFs). ChIP-seq is revealing the global binding profiles of a fraction of TFs in a fraction of their biological contexts. These data show that the majority of TFs bind directly next to a large number of context-relevant target genes, that most binding is distal, and that binding is context specific. Because of the effort and cost involved, ChIP-seq is seldom used in search of novel TF function. Such exploration is instead done using expression perturbation and genetic screens. Here we propose a comprehensive computational framework for transcription factor function prediction. We curate 332 high-quality nonredundant TF binding motifs that represent all major DNA binding domains, and improve cross-species conserved binding site prediction to obtain 3.3 million conserved, mostly distal, binding site predictions. We combine these with 2.4 million facts about all human and mouse gene functions, in a novel statistical framework, in search of enrichments of particular motifs next to groups of target genes of particular functions. Rigorous parameter tuning and a harsh null are used to minimize false positives. Our novel PRISM (predicting regulatory information from single motifs) approach obtains 2543 TF function predictions in a large variety of contexts, at a false discovery rate of 16%. The predictions are highly enriched for validated TF roles, and 45 of 67 (67%) tested binding site regions in five different contexts act as enhancers in functionally matched cells.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Aaron M.

c9d71b694b737f3a0d967d786a8076fe955266ff,MaXLinker: proteome-wide cross-link identifications with high specificity and sensitivity,"Protein-protein interactions play a vital role in nearly all cellular functions. Hence, understanding their interaction patterns and three-dimensional structural conformations can provide crucial insights about various biological processes and underlying molecular mechanisms for many disease phenotypes. Cross-linking mass spectrometry has the unique capability to detect protein-protein interactions at a large scale along with spatial constraints between interaction partners. However, the current cross-link search algorithms follow an â€œMS2-centricâ€ approach and, as a result, suffer from a high rate of mis-identified cross-links (~15%). We address this urgent problem, by designing a novel â€œMS3-centricâ€ approach for cross-link identification and implemented it as a search engine called MaXLinker. MaXLinker significantly outperforms the current state of the art search engine with up to 18-fold lower false positive rate. Additionally, MaXLinker results in up to 31% more cross-links, demonstrating its superior sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we performed proteome-wide cross-linking mass spectrometry using K562 cells. Employing MaXLinker, we unveiled the most comprehensive set of 9,319 unique cross-links at 1% false discovery rate, comprising 8,051 intraprotein and 1,268 interprotein cross-links. Finally, we experimentally validated the quality of a large number of novel interactions identified in our study, providing a conclusive evidence for MaXLinkerâ€™s robust performance.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""K.

9646322ba689d58a667c9c7e6ce4ea17b48f3fa4,Comprehensive characterization of the adult ND4 Swiss Webster mouse retina: Using discovery-based mass spectrometry to decipher the total proteome and phosphoproteome,"Purpose
Diverse groups of proteins play integral roles in both the physiology and pathophysiology of the retina. However, thorough proteomic analyses of retinas of experimental species are currently unavailable. The purpose of the present paper is providing the field with a comprehensive proteomic characterization of the retina of a commonly used laboratory mouse using a discovery-based mass spectrometry (MS) approach.


Methods
Retinas from eight male and eight female 30-week-old outbred ND4 Swiss Webster mice were harvested and immediately processed for MS analysis on a Thermo Fisher (TF) Fusion Orbitrap MS. The retinal proteome and phosphoproteome were identified and subsequently analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 and Panther-GeneGo. SEQUEST-HT scoring was used for analysis, and the reference protein FASTA database was from Mus musculus. Specifically, three technical repeats were performed for each biological sample. For characterization, only high-scoring peptides were considered, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1%. Downstream bioinformatic analysis used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen).


Results
Using Proteome Discoverer 2.2, 4,767 different proteins were identified and segregated into 26 major protein classes, 9 functional molecular classes, and 12 categories of biological processes. The five largest protein classes included the following: nucleic acid binding (17%), hydrolases (13%), enzyme modulators (10%), transferases (9%), and oxidoreductases (6%). ""Binding"" and ""catalytic"" proteins contributed to 81% of the molecular function class at 37% and 42%, respectively. ""Cellular processing"" and ""metabolic processes"" contributed the most to biologic activity, at 31% and 26%, respectively. Phosphopeptide enrichment yielded the identification of 610 additional unique proteins that were not originally identified. The two datasets combined produced an adult mouse retinal proteome consisting of 5,377 unique proteins. Overall, 41% of the retinal proteome was phosphorylated. The overwhelming diversity of retinal protein functionality was reflected through further analyses revealing 2,086 unique pathway hits across 241 different pathways (TF). A core analysis summary report was performed in IPA (Qiagen) to analyze the top signaling networks, protein-protein interaction (PPI) enrichments, and canonical pathways.


Conclusions
Using this high-throughput technique, we have further deciphered and updated the diverse proteome of the mouse retina, including the phosphoproteome, thereby providing the most comprehensive proteomic profile for this tissue known to date. These findings, and the bioinformatic analyses we also provided, establish a platform for future studies, facilitating the elucidation of the relevance of these proteins to the molecular and cellular pathologies that underlie retinal function and disease.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jarrod C.

Methods: We performed a metabolomics study on biorepository plasma samples collected from a single academic medical center on 90 adults with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis. We first generated metabolomic data using gas and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. We then utilized multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between plasma ascorbic acid and 28-day mortality. We performed fold change analysis based on false discovery rate adjusted p values to evaluate the distribution of individual metabolite concentrations relative to ascorbic acid levels. We followed this by partial least squaresdiscriminant analysis to identify individual metabolites that discriminated ascorbic acid levels. We then interrogated the entire metabolomics profile using pathway over-representation analysis to identify groups of metabolite pathways that were differential relative to ascorbic acid levels. Results: Ascorbic acid plasma levels were significantly lower in patients who died by 28 days (False Discovery Rate adjusted P = 0.043). Following adjustment for APACHE II score, renal function and sepsis, higher plasma ascorbic acid levels early in the ICU stay were associated with lower 28-day mortality [OR = 0.72 (95%CI 0.52â€“0.98);P = 0.039]. Metabolomic profiles significantly differed in critically ill patients relative to plasma ascorbic acid levels. In particular, decreased erythrulose (a metabolite of ascorbic acid) was the only strong predictor of low ascorbic acid levels. No metabolite pathways were significantly altered with regard to Ascorbic Acid levels. Conclusions: Low Ascorbic Acid levels early in severe critical illness are a robust predictor of 28day mortality. Differential metabolic profiles during critical illness exist according to Ascorbic Acid levels but limited to direct metabolites of Ascorbic Acid. Metabololite pathyways did not appear to be disrupted relative to differential Ascorbic Acid levels.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Inwon Park"", ids = ""7339607""); list(name = ""Mingyo Kim"", ids = ""17796540""); list(name = ""Eunjoo Song"", ids = ""2447957""); list(name = ""Kibaek Choe"", ids = ""4248321""); list(name = ""Yoonha Hwang"", ids = ""3926893""); list(name = ""Howon Seo"", ids = ""9510212""); list(name = ""Jinhyo Ahn"", ids = ""12063500""); list(name = ""Gou Young Koh"", ids = ""8345429""); list(name = ""Pilhan Kim"", ids = ""2193165"")",,,Critical Care Medicine,46,712
db68e9251960e26b7a7b0f0b690d5fa11fba95a7,Effects of pathogenic CNVs on physical traits in participants of the UK Biobank,"BackgroundCopy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to increase risk for physical anomalies, developmental, psychiatric and medical disorders. Some of them have been associated with changes in weight, height, and other physical traits. As most studies have been performed on children and young people, these effects of CNVs in middle-aged and older people are not well established. The UK Biobank recruited half a million adults who provided a variety of physical measurements. We called all CNVs from the Affymetrix microarrays and selected a set of 54 CNVs implicated as pathogenic (including their reciprocal deletions/duplications) and that were found in five or more persons. Linear regression analysis was used to establish their association with 16 physical traits relevant to human health.Results396,725 participants of white British or Irish descent (excluding first-degree relatives) passed our quality control filters. Out of the 864 CNV/trait associations, 214 were significant at a false discovery rate of 0.1, most of them novel. Many of these traits increase risk for adverse health outcomes: e.g. increases in weight, waist-to-hip ratio, pulse rate and body fat composition. Deletions at 16p11.2, 16p12.1, NRXN1 and duplications at 16p13.11 and 22q11.2 produced the highest numbers of significant associations. Five CNVs produced average changes of over one standard deviation for the 16 traits, compared to controls: deletions at 16p11.2 and 22q11.2, and duplications at 3q29, the Williams-Beuren and Potocki-Lupski regions. CNVs at 1q21.1, 2q13, 16p11.2 and 16p11.2 distal, 16p12.1, 17p12 and 17q12 demonstrated one or more mirror image effects of deletions versus duplications.ConclusionsCarriers of many CNVs should be monitored for physical traits that increase morbidity and mortality. Genes within these CNVs can give insights into biological processes and therapeutic interventions.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""David P.

1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558,Quantitative trait Loci analysis using the false discovery rate.,"False discovery rate control has become an essential tool in any study that has a very large multiplicity problem. False discovery rate-controlling procedures have also been found to be very effective in QTL analysis, ensuring reproducible results with few falsely discovered linkages and offering increased power to discover QTL, although their acceptance has been slower than in microarray analysis, for example. The reason is partly because the methodological aspects of applying the false discovery rate to QTL mapping are not well developed. Our aim in this work is to lay a solid foundation for the use of the false discovery rate in QTL mapping. We review the false discovery rate criterion, the appropriate interpretation of the FDR, and alternative formulations of the FDR that appeared in the statistical and genetics literature. We discuss important features of the FDR approach, some stemming from new developments in FDR theory and methodology, which deem it especially useful in linkage analysis. We review false discovery rate-controlling procedures--the BH, the resampling procedure, and the adaptive two-stage procedure-and discuss the validity of these procedures in single- and multiple-trait QTL mapping. Finally we argue that the control of the false discovery rate has an important role in suggesting, indicating the significance of, and confirming QTL and present guidelines for its use.",2005,Medicine;

d80c526cc47663afbbd992525fabb3d4d67c202a,A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Multi-Trait Clinical Quantitative Trait Locus Modeling,"Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and transcript profiling technologies have enabled the inexpensive production of genome-wide dense marker maps in tandem with huge amounts of expression profiles. These large-scale data encompass valuable information about the genetic architecture of important phenotypic traits. Comprehensive models that combine molecular markers and gene transcript levels are increasingly advocated as an effective approach to dissecting the genetic architecture of complex phenotypic traits. The simultaneous utilization of marker and gene expression data to explain the variation in clinical quantitative trait, known as clinical quantitative trait locus (cQTL) mapping, poses challenges that are both conceptual and computational. Nonetheless, the hierarchical Bayesian (HB) modeling approach, in combination with modern computational tools such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques, provides much versatility for cQTL analysis. SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ and Noykova (2008) developed a HB model for single-trait cQTL analysis in inbred line cross-data using molecular markers, gene expressions, and marker-gene expression pairs. However, clinical traits generally relate to one another through environmental correlations and/or pleiotropy. A multi-trait approach can improve on the power to detect genetic effects and on their estimation precision. A multi-trait model also provides a framework for examining a number of biologically interesting hypotheses. In this paper we extend the HB cQTL model for inbred line crosses proposed by SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ and Noykova to a multi-trait setting. We illustrate the implementation of our new model with simulated data, and evaluate the multi-trait model performance with regard to its single-trait counterpart. The data simulation process was based on the multi-trait cQTL model, assuming three traits with uncorrelated and correlated cQTL residuals, with the simulated data under uncorrelated cQTL residuals serving as our test set for comparing the performances of the multi-trait and single-trait models. The simulated data under correlated cQTL residuals were essentially used to assess how well our new model can estimate the cQTL residual covariance structure. The model fitting to the data was carried out by MCMC simulation through OpenBUGS. The multi-trait model outperformed its single-trait counterpart in identifying cQTLs, with a consistently lower false discovery rate. Moreover, the covariance matrix of cQTL residuals was typically estimated to an appreciable degree of precision under the multi-trait cQTL model, making our new model a promising approach to addressing a wide range of issues facing the analysis of correlated clinical traits.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Crispin M Mutshinda"", ids = ""2509146""); list(name = ""Neli Noykova"", ids = ""4945805""); list(name = ""Mikko J.

5bd53ee8d7cdad0262f039be57b16e414f077f71,"Abstract 232: Characterization of the human miRNA-ome reveals numerous novel, tissue-specific miRNAs that are implicated in cancer biology","Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, âˆ¼22 nt RNAs that are important post-transcriptional regulators of transcript abundance. Since their initial discovery they have been shown to be involved in many cellular processes and their dysregulation has been associated with disease etiology including many cancers. Currently, nearly 2,500 human miRNAs are annotated in public repositories. Key questions in miRNA research include: how many miRNAs are expressed in the human genome? What are their functional roles in various cancers? Herein, we sought to examine the first question through the examination of short RNA-sequence datasets. Methods: We analyzed 1,323 short RNA sequencing datasets (RNA-seq) generated from normal and disease samples representing 13 different human tissue types. We applied the miRDeep2 algorithm on each sample to identify short transcripts that are significantly expressed within the sample that are predicted to form hairpin-shaped secondary structures. Results: Using miRDeep2 with stringent thresholding criteria we discovered 3,707 statistically significant novel mature miRNAs at a false discovery rate of â‰¤ 0.05 that arise from 3,494 precursor loci: 91.5% of these novel miRNAs were discovered independently in 10 or more of the RNA-seq datasets. Analysis of the newly discovered miRNAs reveals that they are tissue-specific in nature. Furthermore, analysis of HITS-CLIP data independently obtained from four of the 13 tissues reveals that 45% of the novel miRNAs are loaded on Argonaute an indication that these miRNAs are active in the RNA interference pathway. Sequence conservation analysis across vertebrate and invertebrate organisms revealed that 56.7% of these new miRNAs are human-specific and the majority of them (94.4%) are primate-lineage specific. Importantly, our profiling of the newly discovered miRNAs showed their differential abundance across different tumor types, and between normal and tumor, and allowed tumor classification. Using orthogonal experimental techniques we have also been able to independently validate several dozen of the novel miRNAs. Conclusions: By analyzing samples from 13 human tissues we discovered 3,707 new miRNAs. This suggests that the repertoire of human miRNAs is larger and more diverse than might have been surmised by the publicly available data. We emphasize that the novel miRNAs we discovered are primate-specific and tissue-specific. This indicates the existence of molecular interactions that cannot be recapitulated by mouse models. As these interactions are numerous and currently uncharacterized they have consequential implications for both the clinical and basic research of cancers. Additionally, the fact that the abundance of our novel miRNAs can distinguish among different tumor types has direct implications for cancer biology and suggests possible uses of these novel molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

a06acd326b08af02ea3d46e96bca9ef4fddde12e,Abstract P4-13-01: Trancriptome sequencing of the hisologicaly normal breast epithelium of BRCA mutation carriers,"Background: Meaningful progress in the prevention of breast cancer is unlikely until the risk of the development of breast cancer is translated into specific, quantifiable molecular alterations. Among those women at the greatest risk are BRCA mutations carriers: 55 to 65% of women who inherit a deleterious BRCA1 mutation and approximately 45 % who inherit a deleterious BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70 years. The purpose of this study was to identify the earliest transcriptional alterations present by examining the histologically normal breast epithelia of BRCA mutation carriers. Methods: Epithelia were microdissected and the RNA isolated from the histologically normal breast of 16 frozen tissue cores from known BRCA mutation carriers, who were donors to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Cancer Center. RNA-sequencing was carried out using the Life Technologies SOLiD XL 5500 Platform. RPKM gene expression values from the BRCA specimens and from Komen normal breast epithelium (controls; Pardo et al, Breast Cancer Research, 2014) were merged, quantile normalized, and batch effect corrected. Normalization and differential gene expression was performed using EdgeR v2.11 Results: 6583 RNAs were differentially expressed with the false discovery rate set at 0.1. 1. DNA damage is signaled by a tripartite system that includes kinases, phosphatases and proteins with modular domains, e.g., the BRCA 1 C-terminal (BRCT), that recognize phosphorylated linear motifs in other proteins. Several BRCT domains recognize motifs phosphorylated by kinases that are activated by DNA damage. To identify the proteins active in DNA damage signaling, Monteiro and colleagues generated a protein-protein interaction map for seven proteins with tandem BRCT (Cell Signaling, 2012). A significant proportion of the genes with decreased expression in our data set encode proteins that have been identified in this network. 2. Two of the top biological processes affected by the BRCA mutations in the histologically normal breast tissue are translation, and cellular protein metabolism. 3. There was significantly less expression of genes associated with other hereditary cancer syndromes inducing the genes responsible for Lynch Syndrome: MHL1, MHS2, MSH6 and PMS2; and the multiple endocrine neoplasia genes RET and MEN1. 4. High grade serous carcinoma of the ovary, the histologic subtype associated with BRCA mutation, may originate in the distal Fallopian tube. The list of differentially expressed genes from microdissected breast epithelia was compared with that derived from gene array profiling of microdissected Fallopian tube epithelium from histologically normal BRCA1 mutation carriers and controls. 795 genes were common to both gene sets, of which 354 were regulated similarly, i.e., increased or decreased. MetaCore data analysis revealed CREB1 and c-Myc as the most important regulatory factors in the similar dataset. Conclusions: There are significant transcription alterations in the histologically normal breast tissue of BRCA mutation carriers. These data will have to be corroborated at the protein level and functional level. Once substantiated, they have potential to stratify risk and to serve as targets for prevention.

f5e177a35f9c049f839cbda877d338dd75de9296,Aberrant patterns of local and long-range functional connectivity densities in schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a disorder of brain dysconnectivity, and both the connection strength and connection number are disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. The functional connectivity density (FCD) can reflect alterations in the connection number. Alterations in the global FCD (gFCD) in schizophrenia were previously demonstrated; however, alterations in two other indices of the pathological characteristics of the brain, local FCD (lFCD) and long-range FCD (lrFCD), have not been revealed. To investigate lFCD and lrFCD alterations in patients with schizophrenia, 95 patients and 93 matched healthy controls were examined using structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. lFCD and lrFCD were measured using FCD mapping, and differences were identified using a two-sample t-test in a voxel-wise manner, with age and gender considered to increase variability. Multiple comparisons were performed using a false discovery rate method with a corrected threshold of P<0.05. Our analysis showed that lFCD was primarily decreased in the postcentral gyrus, right calcarine sulcus, and inferior occipital gyrus lobule, but increased in the bilateral subcortical regions. The differences in lFCD were more pronounced and complicated than those in lrFCD. In summary, in contrast with previous studies that focused on the connection strength, our findings, from the perspective of connection number, indicate that schizophrenia is a disorder of brain dysconnectivity, particularly affecting the local functional connectivity network, and support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with a widespread cortical functional connectivity/activity deficit, with hyper- and/or hypo-connectivity/activity coexisting in some cortical or subcortical regions.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chuanxin Liu"", ids = ""5578962""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""143652300""); list(name = ""Guangdong Chen"", ids = ""48390799""); list(name = ""Hongjun Tian"", ids = ""15444792""); list(name = ""Jie Li"", ids = ""47785980""); list(name = ""Hongru Qu"", ids = ""152332457""); list(name = ""Langlang Cheng"", ids = ""19271403""); list(name = ""Jingjing Zhu"", ids = ""47054791""); list(name = ""Chuanjun Zhuo"", ids = ""1853979"")",5712bb8dd122f34e6e4423dc2c2fbafc5bad6ddf; 4945407b8339ba291ece5c55cc866fc3a17c0cdf; 059b5ae0e82856c8d592e61d538042222d8f52b1; 9b23ffa63cd24e0b33aa53fbb60c1a57c37fd750; 2d097baffae39702fc07a6e6c88b4b465101458f; 078f7402131ed1e0fa75a9e4286ac1c6d0d47812,3492983e66c7b2fd51be2e3c269ec32e2dccfde2; 99a8af9d1e3af8d89ada7bcc801ce8d949848e46; 6e9b81745d18f365c66e5a57e409bb014e9be942; c75deae4f847990a0ed92db113928545bfbc39c9; d22b82c48b7aeac40073cb36862a50fac5825a57; 78662d9100c94a6e95079f874f7c416014b13025; 6aae2d07c79d4675d5b9a1430053ef81ddd4a57e; 1e156b99a120c45180a988592e7f53a972f622b4; 023c4a48c4783c0aeab42e8027fff605c888fe89; b508c32cb47acd91c0702fdac8471a1511c29785; e83ef5fc27cbd4a120bd7eb13f68ce4b2d74e4e0; 68d335c29a9e77f241a2f93d5c06cc40b3f315fb; 8cfeb68228d86d29ef7a86331cbc4aefac1a2e9b; 1a7381ee37e349dc64cb6144224607b1bfab205c; 833b00db0d60c2113b47a67df54260f72d0a0eb7; afd27a162023d53161f8a096e0721f73d4f9a36c; 9ad25b7e079151645778a9bb714f6d1a949b8bbb; 1fa5047279de6c7a0573c8727467cc904eb4d24d; 6a1fd4dd83b4e3b16068885094e6a6fa20b10435; 5086bc888f5b44d2bcd15827bdc7ae4e30ee55c7; 70be7bb1a96af2c6442452f6b51b293b42b41850; 2cc79c8d6a96ca4e0f439ccb11032be9c58c0a96; 22f00620d3f19cf4c2ca6327e1798514abf7e64d; 07bcf7295dbe32a6617be5f5e46f89aadede47d9; 2baf02234ecbfd7b06acabe4d37f8cdc3db41d96; 5d7e514d45141178fc1061bd18f1102d8318a8c3; 6ce06a23712238031015b60ca5c4562c7ff1673b; e42d306348dedad21f117fab2b242fa9ee509525; 9d487eadb24555f0e3bc18a4b4f431a05bcfdf27; 7db3644447e2857c636be4880f5f8ed77004a9f6; 763145d1e1d1c8560a577b715c7b34ce305583bc; 3e88ef6cb3f06465b54cbc92018127f1bdf4bfa8; a47985a2f92d6dea018aaf582c075458d22c9c1f; cd9e7e7e29e4c953d4ee363dd359096c17368292; 98344da946652d765346a9666afab29d34dff233; 943b462d97982398b63d8962b6243b27c90f0067,Oncotarget,8,48196 - 48203

In this study we explored transcriptional and immunophenotypic characteristics of lymphoid organs of a non-human primate model after total-body irradiation (TBI). Fifteen middle-aged adult, ovariectomized, female cynomolgus macaques received a single dose of 0, 2 or 5 Gy gamma radiation. Thymus, spleen and lymph node from three controls and 2 Gy (n = 2) and 5 Gy (n = 2) exposed animals were assessed for molecular responses to TBI through microarray-based transcriptional profiling at day 5 postirradiation, and cellular changes through immunohistochemical (IHC) characterization of markers for B and T lymphocytes and macrophages across all 15 animals at time points up to 6 months postirradiation. Irradiated macaques developed acute hematopoietic syndrome. Analysis of array data at day 5 postirradiation identified transcripts with â‰¥2-fold difference from control and a false discovery rate (FDR) of Padj < 0.05 in lymph node (n = 666), spleen (n = 493) and thymus (n = 3,014). Increasing stringency of the FDR to P < 0.001 reduced the number of genes to 71 for spleen and 379 for thymus. IHC and gene expression data demonstrated that irradiated animals had reduced numbers of T and B lymphocytes along with relative elevations of macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed unique patterns in primary and secondary lymphoid organs of cynomolgus macaques. Among the many differentially regulated transcripts, upregulation of noncoding RNAs [MIR34A for spleen and thymus and NEAT1 (NCRNA00084) for thymus] showed potential as biomarkers of radiation injury and targets for mitigating the effects of radiation-induced hematopoietic syndrome-impaired lymphoid reconstitution.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David L.

38324c29f66d02b49d80040ec1c431350dbe6c2a,Analysis of cortical thickness in narcolepsy patients with cataplexy.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
To investigate differences in cortical thickness in narcolepsy patients with cataplexy and control subjects.


DESIGN
Cortical thickness was measured using a 3-D surface-based method that enables more accurate measurement in deep sulci and localized regional mapping.


SETTING
University hospital.


PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS
We enrolled 28 patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy and 33 age-and sex-matched control subjects.


INTERVENTIONS
Cortical thickness was measured using a direct method for calculating the distance between corresponding vertices from inner and outer cortical surfaces.


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
We normalized cortical surfaces using 2-D surface registration and performed diffusion smoothing to reduce the variability of folding patterns and to increase the power of the statistical analysis. Localized cortical thinning in narcolepsy patients with cataplexy was found in orbitofrontal gyri, dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortexes, insula, cingulate gyri, middle and inferior temporal gyri, and inferior parietal lobule of the right and left hemispheres at the level of a false discovery rate P<0.05. No significant local increases in cortical thickness were observed in narcolepsy patients. A significant negative correlation was observed between the narcolepsy patients' scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the cortical thickness of the left supramarginal gyrus.


CONCLUSIONS
Cortical thinning in narcolepsy patients with cataplexy in localized anatomic brain regions may serve as a possible neuroanatomic mechanism of the disturbances in attention, memory, emotion, and sleepiness.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eun Yeon Joo"", ids = ""1920146""); list(name = ""Seun Jeon"", ids = ""2461127""); list(name = ""Minjoo Lee"", ids = ""2483113""); list(name = ""Sung Tae Kim"", ids = ""1775134""); list(name = ""Uicheul Yoon"", ids = ""145576016""); list(name = ""Dae Lim Koo"", ids = ""5464557""); list(name = ""Jong-Min Lee"", ids = ""114325943""); list(name = ""Seung Bong Hong"", ids = ""3018797"")",c8c98e58702706dff570d7a9d75ea7b5eb765642; 13e15dbeb389c9b9c5c46550f67f13a97a3eb5d0; f3c5394a0bfed76ddbb67cb27b6e82fe94a2fdcb; eb5720fddacb0a9a56ed47ab43be9c5d6144b681; ea1e0335f014f4a46de97fe18223852c3a40e0d8; c638ad88fb5fee720f69b50bdba509aa2f5db221; 1e07a139c611e9ee7cf0a7a73982514bd30a428f; 25f3793bee8a47d8443f729427c27c6f0811ac4b; c8c59dc27b0e4add5196d0c9656ac7eb641df485; caa64af3de96b81f8279366325dcfdb247ef834d; 21456828362d285dda1c7e9c920ca55faa73c1bb; ff19f58cfeaf61911b45925489e429046c8df84c; d134be73aef55259d2c0ee7fcb8322a644568304; 92cea772af19ead1b629d1852bdc4b532d054072,,Sleep,34 10,"

3af286d450b598da4c0cbe87709187aeabbf2c95,Mechanisms of Platinum Chemoresistance in Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Although platinum-based
chemotherapy is the standard of care for most cases of advanced lung cancer,
resistance limits its effectiveness. Initial treatments with platinum chemotherapies are
effective in small cell lung cancer (SCLC); often resulting in a complete response
with resistance being acquired after multiple rounds of chemotherapy. In contrast,
initial adenocarcinoma response rates rarely exceed 20% suggesting that
adenocarcinoma is innately resistant.
I hypothesized that chemoresistance is mediated by one or more signalling pathways
dependent on the expression of a single gene, and that these pathways could
ultimately be targeted therapeutically. As such I set out to determine the mechanisms
behind acquired resistance in SCLC and innate chemoresistance in lung
adenocarcinoma.
To address chemoresistance in SCLC, I first developed a cohort of patient derived
xenografts, obtained using Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle
Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), a minimally invasive technique for biopsying lung cancer.
From this cohort of PDXs, I generated an in vivo model of acquired resistance by
treating mice with multiple rounds of chemotherapy. To identify mechanisms of
chemoresistance, gene expression arrays comparing resistant and naive tumours were
performed, identifying differential expression in 767 genes. By comparing these
genes to those identified in acute response to platinum, we identified Notch 3 as a
potential target for the re-sensitization of acquired resistant SCLC to platinum.
To address innate chemoresistance, I developed a synthetic-lethal high throughput
xiv
siRNA screen using the innately resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line.
Optimisation of the screen was performed using a siRNA death control (PLK1),
which induced cell death in the absence of platinum, and a sensitization control
(MTOR), which enhanced cell death only in combination with a sublethal
concentration of carboplatin. These independent controls revealed that the screening
protocol performed within acceptable limits of variability, quality and reproducibility
as determined by Zâ€™ factor analysis. Screening was then performed using a pool of
four siRNAs targeting a single gene in conjunction with vehicle treatment, or with
carboplatin. After screening 18,000 siRNAs targeting coding sequences of the whole
human genome, we identified 909 candidate targets based on fold change difference
between platinum and vehicle treatments, and statistical significance determined by
multiple t-test corrected for false discovery rate.
From the screen I identified and validated several therapeutic targets. Of these
Follistatin, an endogenous Activin/TGFÎ² superfamily ligand trap, was identified as a
potent platinum sensitization agent. Importantly, Follistatin also has the potential to
block Activin/TGBÎ² signaling in the setting of inflammation, fibrosis, renal injury,
cachexia and anemia, all of which are commonly seen in lung cancer patients treated
with platinum agents. I conclude that Follistatin therapy could improve the efficacy of
platinum-based chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma, while at the same time
ameliorate the systemic effects of both chemotherapy and malignancy. Additional material(s) submitted with thesis.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marini Kieren David"", ids = ""82153466"")",,,,,

Objective: We hypothesized that different MS subtypes would show differences in gene expression that could be traced to specific subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Methods: Gene expression in RRMS, SPMS, PPMS and healthy control (HC) PBMCs was analyzed on Affymetrix arrays. In addition, we studied gene expression in pools of purified PBMC subsets. Results: We found 380 genes that were differentially expressed in RRMS, PPMS, SPMS and HCs (false discovery rate < 5%). There were no major differences between the subtypes of MS. The genes showing most prominent expression changes in RRMS were associated with adaptive immune pathways, while genes in PPMS were associated with innate immune system pathways. SPMS patients shared pathways with RRMS and PPMS patients. Gene expression changes were most prominent in B cells, CD8+ T cells and monocytes. Conclusion: Differences in gene expression, which could be traced to B cells, CD8+ T cells and monocytes, were found between MS patients and HCs but only minor differences were observed between MS subgroups.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rikke Lenhard Ratzer"", ids = ""3564000""); list(name = ""Helle Bach SÃ¸ndergaard"", ids = ""34672960""); list(name = ""Jeppe Romme Christensen"", ids = ""47669017""); list(name = ""Lars BÃ¶rnsen"", ids = ""6231753""); list(name = ""Rehannah Borup"", ids = ""2543518""); list(name = ""P.

The analysis of tissue is often confounded by the heterogenous nature, small size of biopsies, and focal presence of tumors. The use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) allows for isolation of nearly pure cell populations enhancing specificity of subsequent analyses. A method developed in our laboratory facilitating the removal of adhered cells utilizing SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion and tandem mass spectrometry was applied to LCM-acquired cells from Basal, Her 2 positive and Luminal A breast tumor tissues. Cells were LCM-acquired from frozen tissue sections corresponding to Basal, Her 2 positive or Luminal A human breast tumor tissue. The sample set consisted of 3 tumors per subgroup with 3 caps per tumor, for a total of 27 caps each containing approximately 10,000 cells corresponding to 3-5 Î¼g protein. The thermoplastic membranes containing the captured cells were peeled from the cap and suspended in SDS loading buffer and gently heated for 10 minutes. The solubilized proteins were electrophoresed 2 cm into a 10-20% Tricine gel followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and peptide extraction. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase (RP) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) on a Thermo Orbitrap instrument. Following LC/MS/MS analysis of the LCM digests, tandem spectra were searched against the human IPI database using the search algorithm, Myrimatch, and the search results filtered using IDPicker. A spectral counting approach was applied to the data-dependent data to compare quantitative differences of proteins identified. A total of 91646 spectra were confidently identified which corresponded to 1671 protein groups across all biological and technical replicates. An average of 545, 543, and 610 protein groups were identified in the basal, Her 2 positive, and Luminal A subtypes, respectively, from an equivalent of roughly 800 cells. Spectral count differences between datasets between normal and tumor samples were analyzed using both a Quasi-likelihood Poisson regression model, developed in-house, in addition to using the Limma package in Bioconductor. Using the criteria of a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05, a total of 90 proteins showed statistically significant differences in expression among the breast tumor subtypes. A hierarchical clustering of these proteins was performed, creating a heat map representing the gene expression patterns of these proteins. As expected, ERBB2 was identified in the Her 2 positive tumor tissue samples; however, this protein was not identified in either the Basal or Luminal A samples. The proteins identified which were found to distinguish each tissue subtype are currently being investigated for their biological relevance in breast cancer pathways and as possible prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

Despite considerable progress in recent years the pathogenesis of preeclampsia remains incompletely understood. Metabolomic studies have the potential to discover novel disease pathways through an unbiased approach but are prone to exaggerating small but statistically significant differences in metabolite levels.

Methods. We selected 36 women who participated in the Proteomics in Preeclampsia (PIP) study from whom plasma samples at gestational weeks 16 and 28 were available. Of these, 18 subsequently developed preeclampsia (cases) and 18 had normotensive pregnancies (controls). Metabolomic studies were performed in plasma using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Statistical analysis was performed using IDEOM version 13.0. More than 2-fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant between the groups (i.e., cases and controls at each gestational age, and between different gestational ages within cases and controls separately).

Results. We detected 133 metabolites which were differentially expressed between the groups. We identified the amino sulfonic acid taurine as differentially regulated between cases and controls with 1.47 and 2.09-fold lower levels in cases compared to controls at weeks 16 and 28, respectively, and with a 1.42-fold increase from week 16 to 28 in controls as opposed to no change in cases. Significant increases (2.28 to 2.92-fold) in progesterone and related metabolites (pregnanediol-3-glucuronide and [ST (2:0)] 5 alpha-cholesta-8,24-dien-3beta-ol) during pregnancy in all women were expected and add further confidence to our data.

Conclusion. Our longitudinal study design and an analysis strategy based not only on statistical significance but also on fold changes detects taurine as marker of preeclampsia. Taurine has anti-inflammatory properties and reduced levels could provide a mechanistic explanation for development of preeclampsia in some women.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Delles"", ids = ""6758107""); list(name = ""Liliya Sungatullina"", ids = ""145219204""); list(name = ""Karl E.

31ea424f756f0d535c933f6a1a5bf3f577da1495,Postnatal choline supplementation selectively attenuates hippocampal microRNA alterations associated with developmental alcohol exposure.,"Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a range of physical, neuropathological, and behavioral alterations, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We have shown that supplementation with the nutrient choline reduces the severity of developmental alcohol-associated deficits in hippocampal-dependent behaviors and normalizes some aspects of hippocampal cholinergic development and DNA methylation patterns. Alcohol's developmental effects may also be mediated, in part, by altering microRNAs (miRNAs) that serve as negative regulators of gene translation. To determine whether choline supplementation alters ethanol's long-lasting effects on miRNAs, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 5.25Â g/kg/day ethanol from postnatal days (PD) 4-9 via intubation; controls received sham intubations. Subjects were treated with choline chloride (100Â mg/kg/day) or saline vehicle subcutaneously (s.c.) from PD 4-21. On PD 22, subjects were sacrificed, and RNA was isolated from the hippocampus. MiRNA expression was assessed with TaqMan Human MicroRNA Panel Low-Density Arrays. Ethanol significantly increased miRNA expression variance, an effect that was attenuated with choline supplementation. Cluster analysis of stably expressed miRNAs that exceeded an ANOVA pÂ <Â 0.05 criterion indicated that for both male and female offspring, control and ethanol-exposed groups were most dissimilar from each other, with choline-supplemented groups in between. MiRNAs that expressed an average 2-fold change due to ethanol exposure were further analyzed to identify which ethanol-sensitive miRNAs were protected by choline supplementation. We found that at a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted criterion of pÂ <Â 0.05, miR-200c was induced by ethanol exposure and that choline prevented this effect. Collectively, our data show that choline supplementation can normalize disturbances in miRNA expression following developmental alcohol exposure and can protect specific miRNAs from induction by ethanol. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms by which choline may serve as a potential treatment for FASD.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sridevi Balaraman"", ids = ""8909281""); list(name = ""Nirelia M.

6b059c9a56f20957086ed3bea82bbd2a9682f568,A global approach to identify differentially expressed genes in cDNA (two-color) microarray experiments,"MOTIVATION
Currently most of the methods for identifying differentially expressed genes fall into the category of so called single-gene-analysis, performing hypothesis testing on a gene-by-gene basis. In a single-gene-analysis approach, estimating the variability of each gene is required to determine whether a gene is differentially expressed or not. Poor accuracy of variability estimation makes it difficult to identify genes with small fold-changes unless a very large number of replicate experiments are performed.


RESULTS
We propose a method that can avoid the difficult task of estimating variability for each gene, while reliably identifying a group of differentially expressed genes with low false discovery rates, even when the fold-changes are very small. In this article, a new characterization of differentially expressed genes is established based on a theorem about the distribution of ranks of genes sorted by (log) ratios within each array. This characterization of differentially expressed genes based on rank is an example of all-gene-analysis instead of single gene analysis. We apply the method to a cDNA microarray dataset and many low fold-changed genes (as low as 1.3 fold-changes) are reliably identified without carrying out hypothesis testing on a gene-by-gene basis. The false discovery rate is estimated in two different ways reflecting the variability from all the genes without the complications related to multiple hypothesis testing. We also provide some comparisons between our approach and single-gene-analysis based methods.

Methods: We performed an individual-based genetic association study with time to renal and retinal outcomes in 1,362 white probands with T1D from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study. Specifically, we genotyped 1,411 SNPs that capture common variations in 212 candidate genes for long-term complications and analyzed them for association with the time from DCCT baseline to event for renal and retinal outcomes using multivariate Cox proportion hazards models. To address multiple testing and assist interpretation of the results, false discovery rate q values were calculated separately for each outcome. Results: We observed association between rs17880135 in the 3â€² region of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and the incidence of both severe nephropathy (Hazard Ratio (HR)=2.62, 95%CI 1.64 âˆ’4.18, p=5.6 Ã— 10 âˆ’5 , q=0.06) and persistent microalbuminuria (HR=1.82, 95%CI=1.29-2.57, p=6.4 Ã— 10 âˆ’4 , q=0.46). Sequencing and fine-mapping identified additional SOD1 variants, including rs202446, rs9974610, rs204732 which were also associated (p âˆ’3 ) with persistent microalbuminuria, while rs17880135 and rs17881180 were similarly associated with the development of severe nephropathy. Attempts to replicate the findings in three cross-sectional case-control studies produced equivocal results. We observed no striking differences between risk genotypes in serum SOD activity, serum SOD1 mass, nor SOD1 mRNA expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines.

72deb420f4322245cf8a0f3e7a24fdd81d93651f,"Analysis of High Accuracy, Quantitative Proteomics Data in the MaxQB Database*","MS-based proteomics generates rapidly increasing amounts of precise and quantitative information. Analysis of individual proteomic experiments has made great strides, but the crucial ability to compare and store information across different proteome measurements still presents many challenges. For example, it has been difficult to avoid contamination of databases with low quality peptide identifications, to control for the inflation in false positive identifications when combining data sets, and to integrate quantitative data. Although, for example, the contamination with low quality identifications has been addressed by joint analysis of deposited raw data in some public repositories, we reasoned that there should be a role for a database specifically designed for high resolution and quantitative data. Here we describe a novel database termed MaxQB that stores and displays collections of large proteomics projects and allows joint analysis and comparison. We demonstrate the analysis tools of MaxQB using proteome data of 11 different human cell lines and 28 mouse tissues. The database-wide false discovery rate is controlled by adjusting the project specific cutoff scores for the combined data sets. The 11 cell line proteomes together identify proteins expressed from more than half of all human genes. For each protein of interest, expression levels estimated by label-free quantification can be visualized across the cell lines. Similarly, the expression rank order and estimated amount of each protein within each proteome are plotted. We used MaxQB to calculate the signal reproducibility of the detected peptides for the same proteins across different proteomes. Spearman rank correlation between peptide intensity and detection probability of identified proteins was greater than 0.8 for 64% of the proteome, whereas a minority of proteins have negative correlation. This information can be used to pinpoint false protein identifications, independently of peptide database scores. The information contained in MaxQB, including high resolution fragment spectra, is accessible to the community via a user-friendly web interface at http://www.biochem.mpg.de/maxqb.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christoph Schaab"", ids = ""2184005"");

59b24a281aeb6b1d1825fd5fcc1dcef443c33d77,Building and searching predicted spectral libraries for identification of protein post-translational modifications,"Post-translational modification (PTM) is a key step in protein biosynthesis, critical for the correct trafficking and function of the protein. However, the high-throughput identification of additional biochemical functional groups, such as phosphate and glycans, involved in PTM remains a challenge in proteomics. The traditional search strategy based on protein sequence database is time-consuming and prone to false positives because of its exponentially increased search space and incomplete theoretical fragmentation model. Due to its advantages in efficiency and sensitivity, spectral library searching is a promising alternative to conventional sequence database searching. Our work aims to facilitate PTM identification in the spectral library search approach. In particular, we first applied the approach on two important and challenging PTMs, phosphorylation and glycosylation, and extended the method to other modifications. In phosphorylated peptide identification, the largest collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem mass (MS2) spectral libraries of phosphorylated peptides in human and other model organisms to date have been built in an automatic platform consist of multiple state-of-art search engines and site-localization tools with strict quality control. Spectral library searching using this library significantly outperforms existing methods for detecting phosphosites in a variety of datasets. In glycopeptide identification, a spectral library searching method was developed to identify intact N-linked glycopeptides from the MS2 spectra, based upon an existing spectrum prediction tool, MassAnalyzer (Zhang, Z., Anal. Chem. 2010), to account for the special fragmentation patterns of glycopeptides. We evaluated the scoring functions, developed methods to analyze ambiguous candidates and clustered the predicted spectral library to reduce the searching cost. A novel query decoy strategy was further applied to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of glycopeptides. The spectral library searching strategy was successfully verified in the searching of standard N-linked glycoproteins.

We compared existing single-marker and haplotype-based methods for GWAS with a focus on barley. Based on German winter barley cultivars, four different single-marker and haplotype-based methods were tested for their power to detect significant associations in a large genome with a limited number of markers. We identified significant associations for yield and quality-related traits using the iSelect array with 3886 mapped single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in a structured population consisting of 109 genotypes. Genome simulations with different numbers of genotypes, marker densities and marker effects were used to compare different GWAS methods. Results of simulations revealed a higher power in detecting significant associations for haplotype- than for single-marker approaches, but showed a higher false discovery rate for SNP detection, due to lack of correction for population structure. Our simulations revealed that a population size of about 500 individuals is required to detect QTLs explaining a small trait variance (<10%).",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Inka Gawenda"", ids = ""2241904""); list(name = ""Patrick Thorwarth"", ids = ""11021136""); list(name = ""Torsten GÃ¼nther"", ids = ""3861456""); list(name = ""Frank Ordon"", ids = ""88350434""); list(name = ""Karl J.

b1c253d2669874b8b13cfb02c66fc310638d1e3a,Comment on â€œNuclear localization of LDL receptor-related protein 1B in mammary gland carcinogenesisâ€,"To the editor: We read with great interest the article by Asano and colleagues [1]. The study illuminated that the nuclear-localized LRP1B intracellular domain promoted breast cancer progression with poor prognosis, which possibly through the NEAT1 pathway. The results are very helpful to find new therapeutic target for breast cancer patients. On the other hand, from our perspective, the bioinformatics analyses need further context as the statistics for differential fold changes in expression data are not explained fully. For example, the authors seem to use unadjusted p values for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated genes by nuclear-localized LRP1B intracellular domain. Due to the high false positives caused by a large number of probes and multiple comparisons, it seems essential to analyze microarray data properly to reach a reliable result by a statistical method. Only selecting DEGs with unadjusted p values < 0.05 in expression is not reliable and suitable for high-level microarray analysis. Moreover, we would like to suggest using specialized highlevel microarray analysis such as LIMMA (linear models for microarray analysis) [2], commonly used for statistical testing and analysis of differential expression data by using linear models, and choosing more than 1.5-fold expression changes and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 as the cutoff is an appropriate and conservative approach to obtain DEGs [3]. Moreover, modified significant analysis of microarray [4] is another and considerable non-parametric statistical algorithm; a 2-fold expression change and FDR < 0.1 is a rational cutoff to obtain DEGs. In addition, choosing the optimal statistical approach [5] and obtaining accurate and convincing results of DEGs analysis are basis for further data analysis such as gene network analysis. We welcome the authors to offer further explanation of their data analysis and experimental approach. We suggest transcriptomics data-intensive research would benefit from these considerations and innovations in statistical and data analytical approaches.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chengyu Yang"", ids = ""51146868""); list(name = ""Long Xuan Zhao"", ids = ""71566286""); list(name = ""Xuemei Liu"", ids = ""49543954""); list(name = ""Ruixia Ma"", ids = ""48887109""); list(name = ""Yan Xu"", ids = ""40616890"")",,0d990fddbd1531cf7080b4d18ea1730e5bdfdfe6; 003fc5c25b94af7318c0c028a645af7f7f64e950; 7398354084da8ad5f01a9661e7b9637b0bc82daf; 94c6482e087d828381d639f355bcd9eb5179d008; 34a44f119c16dd966617645e5190bd5c08a64783; e67f43b2fdfc0a6d356c0e29b71d14ef2decae41,Journal of Molecular Medicine,97,737
31510001b708999bde9b7df6e0cfbeeff791aee4,Specific autoantibody profiles and disease subgroups correlate with circulating micro-RNA in systemic sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the expression profiles of cell-free plasma miRNAs in SSc and to characterize their correlation with disease subgroups (lcSSc and dcSSc) and with autoantibody profiles.


METHODS
Using quantitative RT-PCR, the abundance of 45 mature miRNAs in plasma was determined in 95 patients (lcSSc = 63; dcSSc = 32), representing the following autoantibody subgroups: ACA, anti-DNA topoisomerase I, anti-RNA polymerase III and anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein. MiRNA data were correlated with clinical and paraclinical data. Multiple regression was used to model membership of the lcSSc, dcSSc and autoantibody subgroups, based on miRNA expression profiles.


RESULTS
Thirty-six miRNAs were measurable in all samples. Four (miRNA-223, -181b, -342-3p and -184) were differently expressed in lcSSc and dcSSc (false discovery rate < 0.05). Ten miRNAs exhibited statistically significantly different levels in one or more autoantibody groups, and five (miRNA-409, -184, -92a, -29a and -101) remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Multiple regression models accurately predicted ACA and anti-DNA topoisomerase I antibody-positive patients (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.97 and 0.93, respectively) as well as membership of the dcSSc and lcSSc groups (AUC = 0.88).


CONCLUSION
Circulating miRNA profiles differ between lcSSc and dcSSc patients and between patients with different autoantibodies. This is the first time autoantibody profiles, disease phenotypes and plasma miRNA profiles have been shown to correlate in an autoimmune disease. The data support a pathobiological role of miRNAs because specific miRNAs associate with autoantibody profiles of known diagnostic and prognostic value.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dirk M.

Epidemiology studies have linked exposure to pollutant particles to increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the mechanisms remain unknown.


OBJECTIVES
We tested the hypothesis that the ultrafine fraction of ambient pollutant particles would cause endothelial cell dysfunction.


METHODS
We profiled gene expression of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) exposed to ultrafine particles (UFPs; 100 microg/mL) from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, or vehicle for 4 hr with Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 chips (n = 4 each).


RESULTS
We found 320 up-regulated genes and 106 down-regulated genes (p < 0.01, 5% false discovery rate). We noted up-regulation of genes related to coagulation [tissue factor (F3) and coagulation factor II receptor-like 2 (F2RL2)] and differential regulation of genes related to F3 signaling (FOS, JUN, and NFKBIA). Results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction show a significant up-regulation of F3 after 10 and 100 microg/mLUFP exposures. Additionally, the water-soluble fractions of UFPs were sufficient to induce the expression of F3, F2RL2, and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). Treatment of HPAEC with UFPs for 16 hr increased the release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Pretreatment of HPAEC with a blocking antibody against F3 attenuated IL-6 and IL-8 release by 30 and 70%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Using gene profiling, we discovered that UFPs may induce vascular endothelial cells to express genes related to clotting. These results indicate that PM may cause adverse cardiovascular health effects by activating coagulation-inflammation circuitry.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Edward D.

147a869afd0dcf0f53e12a55f985187db3a68895,Statistical detection of short periodic gene expression time series profiles,"Many cellular processes exhibit periodic behaviors. Hence, one of the important tasks in gene expression data analysis is to detect subset of genes that exhibit cyclicity or periodicity in their gene expression time series profiles. Unfortunately, gene expression time series profiles are usually of very short length and highly contaminated with noise. This makes detection of periodic profiles a very difficult problem. Recently, a hypothesis testing method based on the Fisher gâ€statistic with correction for multiple testing has been proposed to detect periodic gene expression profiles. However, it was observed that the test is not reliable if the signal length is too short.

3462003f7001518e4875d201d602ca30c0e46195,Analysis of Kinase Gene Expression in the Frontal Cortex of Suicide Victims: Implications of Fear and Stressâ€ ,"Suicide is a serious public health issue that results from an interaction between multiple risk factors including individual vulnerabilities to complex feelings of hopelessness, fear, and stress. Although kinase genes have been implicated in fear and stress, including the consolidation and extinction of fearful memories, expression profiles of those genes in the brain of suicide victims are less clear. Using gene expression microarray data from the Online Stanley Genomics Database and a quantitative PCR, we investigated the expression profiles of multiple kinase genes including the calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK), the cyclin-dependent kinase, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the protein kinase C (PKC) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mood disorder patients died with suicide (Nâ€‰=â€‰45) and without suicide (Nâ€‰=â€‰38). We also investigated the expression pattern of the same genes in the PFC of developing humans ranging in age from birth to 49â€‰year (Nâ€‰=â€‰46). The expression levels of CAMK2B, CDK5, MAPK9, and PRKCI were increased in the PFC of suicide victims as compared to non-suicide controls (false discovery rate, FDR-adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, fold change >1.1). Those genes also showed changes in expression pattern during the postnatal development (FDR-adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). These results suggest that multiple kinase genes undergo age-dependent changes in normal brains as well as pathological changes in suicide brains. These findings may provide an important link to protein kinases known to be important for the development of fear memory, stress associated neural plasticity, and up-regulation in the PFC of suicide victims. More research is needed to better understand the functional role of these kinase genes that may be associated with the pathophysiology of suicide.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kwang Choi"", ids = ""32987861""); list(name = ""Thien Le"", ids = ""143715558""); list(name = ""Guoqiang Xing"", ids = ""39236412""); list(name = ""Luke R Johnson"", ids = ""35823715""); list(name = ""Robert J.

ebfd5ac1aa08f3bab87defe592581b80b5211bef,Genetic variants in the apelin system and blood pressure responses to dietary sodium interventions: a family-based association study.,"OBJECTIVE
We examined the association between genetic variants in the apelin system and blood pressure (BP) responses to low-sodium and high-sodium interventions in the GenSalt Study.


METHODS
A 7-day low-sodium intervention (51.3 mmol sodium per day) followed by a 7-day high-sodium intervention (307.8 mmol sodium per day) was conducted among 1906 participants from 637 Han Chinese families. BP measurements were obtained at baseline and following each intervention using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including both tag and functional SNPs, were selected from three candidate genes (APLN, APLNR, and ACE2). Single marker and haplotype analyses were conducted using the Family Based Association Test program. The false discovery rate method was used to correct for multiple testing.


RESULTS
SNPs rs2282623 and rs746886 of the APLNR gene were significantly associated with DBP (both P = 0.002) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively) responses to low-sodium intervention. Six SNPs of the ACE2 gene were significantly associated with SBP, DBP, or MAP responses to low-sodium intervention. Three of them, rs1514283, rs1514282, and rs4646176, were also significantly associated with MAP response to high-sodium intervention (all P <or= 0.006). Haplotype analysis indicated the A-T-T haplotype of APLNR SNPs rs721608-rs2282623-rs746886 was associated with decreased DBP and MAP responses to low-sodium intervention (P = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively), whereas G-C-C was associated with increased SBP and MAP responses to high-sodium intervention (P = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively).


CONCLUSION
This large family-based study indicates that genetic variants in the APLNR and ACE2 genes are significantly associated with BP responses to dietary sodium intervention.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qi Zhao"", ids = ""145542709""); list(name = ""James E.

This project explores nonparametric graph-theoretic approaches to solving online change-point problems. The foundation for our methodology is the Ensemble Sum of Pair-Maxima (ESPM) Test, a powerful offline test developed by Ruth and Koyak (2011). Our work investigates the efficacy of the ESPM Test in a variety of offline settings, and ultimately extends that test to online settings through a novel modification of recently developed multiple testing procedures designed to control false discovery rate. When tested against simulated and pseudo real-world data, this modified procedure maintains the desired overall test level while achieving impressive power and useful advanced warning times in many scenarios. This method is not limited to the ESPM test and holds much promise for adapting other powerful offline techniques to online scenarios.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Colin E Bodgan"", ids = ""69360228"")",,,,,
8f9be5e406d18d821cfb51896f86e37bd6d7c968,MethLAB: a graphical user interface package for the analysis of array-based DNA methylation data.,"Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation changes may underlie numerous complex traits and diseases. The advent of commercial, array-based methods to interrogate DNA methylation has led to a profusion of epigenetic studies in the literature. Array-based methods, such as the popular Illumina GoldenGate and Infinium platforms, estimate the proportion of DNA methylated at single-base resolution for thousands of CpG sites across the genome. These arrays generate enormous amounts of data, but few software resources exist for efficient and flexible analysis of these data. We developed a software package called MethLAB (http://genetics.emory.edu/conneely/MethLAB) using R, an open source statistical language that can be edited to suit the needs of the user. MethLAB features a graphical user interface (GUI) with a menu-driven format designed to efficiently read in and manipulate array-based methylation data in a user-friendly manner. MethLAB tests for association between methylation and relevant phenotypes by fitting a separate linear model for each CpG site. These models can incorporate both continuous and categorical phenotypes and covariates, as well as fixed or random batch or chip effects. MethLAB accounts for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a user-specified level. Standard output includes a spreadsheet-ready text file and an array of publication-quality figures. Considering the growing interest in and availability of DNA methylation data, there is a great need for user-friendly open source analytical tools. With MethLAB, we present a timely resource that will allow users with no programming experience to implement flexible and powerful analyses of DNA methylation data.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Varun Kilaru"", ids = ""2535041""); list(name = ""Richard T.

To extract these sub-threshold signals, there is a need for methods which accurately estimate the mean of all (normally-distributed) test-statistics from a genome scan (i.e., Z-scores). This is currently achieved by the difficult procedures of adjusting all Z-score statistics for â€œwinnerâ€™s curseâ€ (multiple testing). Given that multiple testing adjustments are much simpler for p-values, we propose a method for estimating Z-scores means by i) first adjusting their p-values for multiple testing and then ii) transforming the adjusted p-values to upper tail Z-scores with the sign of the original statistics. Because a False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure is used for multiple testing adjustment, we denote this method FDR Inverse Quantile Transformation (FIQT). When compared to competitors, e.g. Empirical Bayes (including proposed improvements), FIQT is more i) accurate and ii) computationally efficient by orders of magnitude. Its accuracy advantage is substantial at larger sample sizes and/or moderate numbers of association signals. Practical application of FIQT to Z-scores from the first Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia predicts a non-trivial fraction of the significant signal regions from the subsequent published PGC schizophrenia studies. Finally, we suggest that FIQT might be i) used to improve subject level risk prediction and ii) further improved by modelling the noncentrality of statistics.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""T.

321f8afda7135cb730dd9033ace37bc6f6fa908c,Neurochemical Metabolomics Reveals Disruption to Sphingolipid Metabolism Following Chronic Haloperidol Administration,"Haloperidol is an effective antipsychotic drug for treatment of schizophrenia, but prolonged use can lead to debilitating side effects. To better understand the effects of long-term administration, we measured global metabolic changes in mouse brain following 3Â mg/kg/day haloperidol for 28Â days. These conditions lead to movement-related side effects in mice akin to those observed in patients after prolonged use. Brain tissue was collected following microwave tissue fixation to arrest metabolism and extracted metabolites were assessed using both liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (MS). Over 300 unique compounds were identified across MS platforms. Haloperidol was found to be present in all test samples and not in controls, indicating experimental validity. Twenty-one compounds differed significantly between test and control groups at the pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 level. Top compounds were robust to analytical method, also being identified via partial least squares discriminant analysis. Four compounds (sphinganine, N-acetylornithine, leucine and adenosine diphosphate) survived correction for multiple testing in a non-parametric analysis using false discovery rate thresholdâ€‰<â€‰0.1. Pathway analysis of nominally significant compounds (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) revealed significant findings for sphingolipid metabolism (pâ€‰=â€‰0.015) and protein biosynthesis (pâ€‰=â€‰0.024). Altered sphingolipid metabolism is suggestive of disruptions to myelin. This interpretation is supported by our observation of elevated N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamateÂ in the haloperidol-treated mice (pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), a marker previously associated with demyelination.

00de5253219aac3346bcba036c8295ba4031c349,Reliable detection and characterization of low-frequency polarized sources in the LOFAR M51 field,"The new generation of broad-band radio continuum surveys will provide large data sets with polarization information. New algorithms need to be developed to extract reliable catalogs of linearly polarized sources that can be used to characterize those sources and produce a dense rotation measure (RM) grid to probe magneto-ionized structures along the line of sight via Faraday rotation. Aims. The aim of the paper is to develop a computationally efficient and rigorously defined source-finding algorithm for linearly polarized sources. Methods. We used a calibrated data set from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 150 MHz centered on the nearby galaxy M 51 to search for polarized background sources. With a new imaging software, we re-imaged the field at a resolution of 18â€³ Ã— 15â€³ and cataloged a total of about 3000 continuum sources within 2.5Â° of the center of M 51. We made small Stokes Q and U images centered on each source brighter than 100 mJy in total intensity (201 sources) and used RM synthesis to create corresponding Faraday cubes that were analyzed individually. For each source, the noise distribution function was determined from a subset of the measurements at high Faraday depths where no polarization is expected; the peaks in polarized intensity in the Faraday spectrum were identified and the p-value of each source was calculated. Finally, the false discovery rate method was applied to the list of p-values to produce a list of polarized sources and quantify the reliability of the detections. We also analyzed sources fainter than 100 mJy but that were reported as polarized in the literature at at least another radio frequency. Results. Of the 201 sources that were searched for polarization, six polarized sources were detected confidently (with a false discovery rate of 5%). This corresponds to a number density of one polarized source per 3.3 square degrees, or 0.3 source per square degree. Increasing the false discovery rate to 50% yields 19 sources. A majority of the sources have a morphology that is indicative of them being double-lobed radio galaxies, and the ones with literature redshift measurements have 0.5 < z < 1.0. Conclusions. We find that this method is effective in identifying polarized sources, and is well suited for LOFAR observations. In the future, we intend to develop it further and apply it to larger data sets such as the LOFAR Two-meter Survey of the whole northern sky, LOTSS, and the ongoing deep LOFAR observations of the GOODS-North field.",2018,Physics,"list(name = ""A.

14b85e5a4e78dfb07ed91f487c20ac53c59f9f30,A highly sensitive and specific workflow for detecting rare copy-number variants from exome sequencing data,"Exome sequencing (ES) is a first-tier diagnostic test for many suspected Mendelian disorders. While it is routine to detect small sequence variants, it is not a standard practice in clinical settings to detect germline copy-number variants (CNVs) from ES data due to several reasons relating to performance. In this work, we comprehensively characterized one of the most sensitive ES-based CNV tools, ExomeDepth, against SNP array, a standard of care test in clinical settings to detect genome-wide CNVs. We propose a modified ExomeDepth workflow by excluding exons with low mappability prior to variant calling to drastically reduce the false positives originating from the repetitive regions of the genome, and an iterative variant calling framework to assess the reproducibility. We used a cohort of 307 individuals with clinical ES data and clinical SNP array to estimate the sensitivity and false discovery rate of the CNV detection using exome sequencing. Further, we performed targeted testing of the STRC gene in 1972 individuals. To reduce the number of variants for downstream analysis, we performed a large-scale iterative variant calling process with random control cohorts to assess the reproducibility of the CNVs. The modified workflow presented in this paper reduced the number of total variants identified by one third while retaining a higher sensitivity of 97% and resulted in an improved false discovery rate of 11.4% compared to the default ExomeDepth pipeline. The exclusion of exons with low mappability removes 4.5% of the exons, including a subset of exons (0.6%) in disease-associated genes which are intractable by short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS). Results from the reproducibility analysis showed that the clinically reported variants were reproducible 100% of the time and that the modified workflow can be used to rank variants from high to low confidence. Targeted testing of 30 CNVs identified in STRC, a challenging gene to ascertain by NGS, showed a 100% validation rate. In summary, we introduced a modification to the default ExomeDepth workflow to reduce the false positives originating from the repetitive regions of the genome, created a large-scale iterative variant calling framework for reproducibility, and provided recommendations for implementation in clinical settings.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan"", ids = ""47530565""); list(name = ""Jill R.

Separation was performed in a 1-meter long hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC)-coated capillary, using 8% (V/V) formic acid (FA) in 70% (V/V) methanol and 22% water as the background electrolyte (BGE). A flow-through microvial interface was used to couple the CE system with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer, and field-amplified sample stacking was used to improve the concentration sensitivity. Using this optimized method, 3579 peptides and 1141 proteins were identified using the Proteome Discoverer software with a 1% false discovery rate at the protein level. Relative to conventional aqueous CE, HOCE-MS did a better job of discovering hydrophobic peptides and provided more peptide and protein identifications. Relative to NanoLC-MS, it achieved comparable peptide and protein identification performance and detected peptides not identified by LC-MS: of the full set of peptides identified using the two techniques, 19% were identified only using HOCE-MS. It also outperformed NanoLC-MS with respect to the detection of low molecular weight peptides. This article is protected by copyright.

804f95b2285cb3c02991b0c7b62ae9ff3276b8b6,Effects of Silver Nitrate and Silver Nanoparticles on a Planktonic Community: General Trends after Short-Term Exposure,"Among metal pollutants silver ions are one of the most toxic forms, and have thus been assigned to the highest toxicity class. Its toxicity to a wide range of microorganisms combined with its low toxicity to humans lead to the development of a wealth of silver-based products in many bactericidal applications accounting to more than 1000 nano-technology-based consumer products. Accordingly, silver is a widely distributed metal in the environment originating from its different forms of application as metal, salt and nanoparticle. A realistic assessment of silver nanoparticle toxicity in natural waters is, however, problematic and needs to be linked to experimental approaches. Here we apply metatranscriptome sequencing allowing for elucidating reactions of whole communities present in a water sample to stressors. We compared the toxicity of ionic silver and ligand-free silver nanoparticles by short term exposure on a natural community of aquatic microorganisms. We analyzed the effects of the treatments on metabolic pathways and species composition on the eukaryote metatranscriptome level in order to describe immediate molecular responses of organisms using a community approach. We found significant differences between the samples treated with 5 Âµg/L AgNO3 compared to the controls, but no significant differences in the samples treated with AgNP compared to the control samples. Statistical analysis yielded 126 genes (KO-IDs) with significant differential expression with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 between the control (KO) and AgNO3 (NO3) groups. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant results with a FDR below 0.05 for pathways related to photosynthesis. Our study therefore supports the view that ionic silver rather than silver nanoparticles are responsible for silver toxicity. Nevertheless, our results highlight the strength of metatranscriptome approaches for assessing metal toxicity on aquatic communities.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""J.

0adea4a19b7c45752ba4f337e354dce265678cab,Identification of Plasma Lipid Metabolites Associated with Nut Consumption in US Men and Women.,"BACKGROUND
Intake of nuts has been inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, partly through inducing a healthy lipid profile. How nut intake may affect lipid metabolites remains unclear.


OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to identify the plasma lipid metabolites associated with habitual nut consumption in US men and women.


METHODS
We analyzed cross-sectional data from 1099 participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Metabolic profiling was conducted on plasma by LC-mass spectrometry. Nut intake was estimated from food-frequency questionnaires. We included 144 known lipid metabolites that had CVs â‰¤25%. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the associations of nut consumption with individual plasma lipid metabolites.


RESULTS
We identified 17 lipid metabolites that were significantly associated with nut intake, based on a 1 serving (28 g)/d increment in multivariate models [false discovery rate (FDR) P value <0.05]. Among these species, 8 were positively associated with nut intake [C24:0 sphingomyelin (SM), C36:3 phosphatidylcholine (PC) plasmalogen-A, C36:2 PC plasmalogen, C24:0 ceramide, C36:1 PC plasmalogen, C22:0 SM, C34:1 PC plasmalogen, and C36:2 phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen], with changes in relative metabolite level (expressed in number of SDs on the log scale) ranging from 0.36 to 0.46 for 1 serving/d of nuts. The other 9 metabolites were inversely associated with nut intake with changes in relative metabolite level ranging from -0.34 to -0.44. In stratified analysis, 3 metabolites were positively associated with both peanuts and peanut butter (C24:0 SM, C24:0 ceramide, and C22:0 SM), whereas 6 metabolites were inversely associated with other nuts (FDR P value <0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
A panel of lipid metabolites was associated with intake of nuts, which may provide insight into biological mechanisms underlying associations between nuts and cardiometabolic health. Metabolites that were positively associated with intake of nuts may be helpful in identifying potential biomarkers of nut intake.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vasanti S.

c1e86496fdd29579afa97bf870fc6abdb5bdad2d,14q32 and let-7 microRNAs regulate transcriptional networks in fetal and adult human erythroblasts,"In humans, fetal erythropoiesis takes place in the liver whereas adult erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow. Fetal and adult erythroid cells are not only produced at different sites, but are also distinguished by their respective transcriptional program. In particular, whereas fetal erythroid cells express Î³-globin chains to produce fetal hemoglobin (HbF), adult cells express Î²-globin chains to generate adult hemoglobin. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch is clinically important as re-activation of HbF production in adult erythroid cells would represent a promising therapy for the hemoglobin disorders sickle cell disease and Î²-thalassemia. We used RNA-sequencing to measure global gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression in human erythroblasts derived ex vivo from fetal liver (n = 12 donors) and bone marrow (n = 12 donors) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We identified 7829 transcripts and 402 miRNA that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <5%). The miRNA expression patterns were replicated in an independent collection of human erythroblasts using a different technology. By combining gene and miRNA expression data, we developed transcriptional networks which show substantial differences between fetal and adult human erythroblasts. Our analyses highlighted the miRNAs at the imprinted 14q32 locus in fetal erythroblasts and the let-7 miRNA family in adult erythroblasts as key regulators of stage-specific erythroid transcriptional programs.

If we use these methods for plant, many structural variations might not be found. Although we can find some structural variations, the valid SVs in them are very few. To enhance precision of detecting structural variations and reduce the false discovery rate in plant, we design an algorithm based on characteristics of the Hedou12 which is one of the important economic corps. The core of the algorithm composes discordant paired-end read analysis model and split-read analysis model, and set cover based on greedy heuristic method. To increase precision of detecting SVs, we separately apply the probability model of discordant paired-end reads and the probability model of split-reads as optimization selection for SVs. And by validity verification, our algorithm can increase precision of detecting SVs.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hui-Qiang Jia"", ids = ""153719901""); list(name = ""Haichao Wei"", ids = ""152917883""); list(name = ""Da-Ming Zhu"", ids = ""7758887""); list(name = ""Xianzhong Feng"", ids = ""144855463""); list(name = ""Feng-hua Liu"", ids = ""50208071""); list(name = ""Jing-Jing Ma"", ids = ""46282743""); list(name = ""Rui-Zhi Wang"", ids = ""2769721""); list(name = ""Cheng Chang"", ids = ""145708349""); list(name = ""Hong-Shuang Li"", ids = ""49404289"")",,86aee9ecb45e543e24e1597505be8a7b7565bead; dec38a7cd26681d3f043e7cfeb2775c6ad839974; 2ca4374a47dec18ce064f166bc0ad89fab10bb51; 7b656fb7a855085ab729d78ade3eff8c643820c9; 4dd42112bf3ec0e6ae0563499903a3f2bdc9a1a0; b6de563c03eedf95d7e880a2aeb5688936ea1d26; 0e1ce9304c80e213a64aa18511b0d799b6cacb68; 4a7855dab20e157ba8f2cc620c46ae6c0159b161; 86fce03c5a932e7cf842238769588a846ec8559b; 0069155557d07843c4d9adf23510e41093b6b7be; 22e4dc33875409bbb19fe7550befd2fd57b77f2d; c6173d394f2377375e6dd67c02241881f93af6b7; 39d66cd565708defe18de5cc805ecadbec44e681; 29ed5e8460606832889fbefd1b732b73993d2475; 0b039e448c10302ac0d0b0ed4629c8ac490ae0a8; 8ecd33733f5b1169fb5f17437711c329fbdfaf37; 39990d887387b14f6d8e6918b37c6f8ea93bf8ff; 7173b100d0eb28d39758d93dcb9b5ff302ef6979; 6e5b65a99d484bc623ac4f8c9d911fad6065945b; acbe851bbcc7288f59784d9878407173f1edffdf; a87de63fe635d8ce4919c3264022a3e9ff4e795b; e433383573a4c3cd804ddd4c3f747ac8588506b4; e6654bc7d668f3577bd30f71f7b4104e10a82636; c06c1cfbcf132e4c2df681bd2171c380f907b552; ba72433527b6027c56635972c398b29e573b4561,DEStech Transactions on Computer Science and Engineering,,
34e4b138ddcb5f131fe528c79d93f12725eb79d6,Bioinformatic analysis of microRNA expression in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a type of movement disorder caused by loss of dopamineâ€‘producing neurons in the midbrain. In order to identify the synergistic microRNA (miRNA) pattern in PD, miRNA and mRNA double expression profiles of PD were downloaded. Differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA were identified [P<0.01, following false discovery rate (FDR) correction]. A cumulative hypergeometric distribution test was then performed to identify synergistic miRNAs (P<0.01, following FDR correction). Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations were performed to analyze the miRNA regulatory target genes. Subsequently, a synergistic miRNA network was constructed and miRNAs exhibiting a high degree were identified. In total, 200 differentially expressed miRNA and 2,966 differentially expressed mRNA were identified. In addition, 1,502 synergistic miRNA interactions were identified, and miRNAs regulated 304 target genes in total. The GO and KEGG analysis demonstrated that these target genes were enriched in biosynthetic and cellular biosynthetic processes, the assembly of cellular components in morphogenesis, mitogenâ€‘activated protein kinase signaling, myometrial relaxation and contraction pathways as well as calcium regulation. The miRNA network demonstrated that miRâ€‘627, miRâ€‘634, miRâ€‘514, miRâ€‘563 and miRâ€‘613 had a high degree. miRNA with a high degree may be associated with the pathogenesis of PD and, therefore, may assist in the diagnosis and therapy of PD.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bin Hao"", ids = ""144649972""); list(name = ""Xin Chen"", ids = ""1719935""); list(name = ""Dongwei Dai"", ids = ""5605480""); list(name = ""Chao Zou"", ids = ""143794000""); list(name = ""Xi Wu"", ids = ""1784900""); list(name = ""Jianchun Chen"", ids = ""49252009"")",3bebbd210980c58a9e91ceb6b0fd39fb0636bab0; a31a2690163370c91d537cefdd4336534aa81c4c; 03a77576ef97f3df183c92f3e2cff887359051be; b16f894d29f259560844d1a141ad7b7f056d836a; dee6c6e8145e417e4f4681f29f48987adf770aa2; f9dc104d2ee873baa7c46e20983d5cb3940a4a00; d90510fff47ec6c39aa20b5c2e37ea74cd448a20; 3c2e4e9dce8d0eee82f2898a84f1d4c8e8093029; 3217a3556bb7521f16bbec638b865841ee267708,b7708b93df6ef6e19b19f255f2f660d33157eea5; 61e893f1090ee77deb658afbc5b2ec19ac5be07b; 23f09ff97f15494d24501a0c7da8d92f58cb4f2c; 27266951e23fb145e9fc7aa3fb828d6ec584e484; 062bf63e3dab1436b3caff615b89e0da1abacb77; 49bfbb240211a9a9017b13b69ee175505dee7ee6; de607b27c4371c3c45d665611f0f63f35e4aeb97; 431a18a4d9d8ada3bae1e8c4d3d89b23d735e9ab; b34a50b9ce1228b1d26d7551d0af39bc7a012bf3; e13ba93e2df00efbb926b088a4170f22b1b6d608; b88c32fc04907e981914b54af37da1fa29e134cd; e0615cda51b65c2dcbbbac97689d93beb18d8fae; e64a5499d34c777f9376f1d7cfec03b2b7b31a07; 4d55f7ee3fa51daa92519c5f21cc2aa7d8aa0889; 11f2a7425f06fa495999a7aa61e920e24a9680d5; dd5663d7ea29fa8b3874e59fd08d65392d530111; 1e89836b74063d6cb7a764a710346ac88ca4ac89; 98907ebedc1dd3849be620f0b43606e1e823e5f4; 5ce9608f59c42567eaf8d0c7fea57537f5ab4bba; 3dc106dfb42019837d0ef90f6197b28d80fdf34f; f857ffde6e9ecb5abe5f30cc2fbe887d732ea987; 25579b047b21a37c1be68a7fd0009dd6cb5a9225; 79d5008e3e3e5004c6792799b9606e1640c9d2e4; 4567bfea9bfaa996683be0e6285821af51578b07; 9994875040826e413c58dc8d2558b965d2c6aeb2; 84d46e3559d267201aafe5ec133f600c0e55593a; 8ad7486f257056f5182e333ed650fd4710496a4d; 8c61dd5b9e339fb61a35820e7e0d7af57ca0026b; b19c77ac1d585d0d1b9170b6414194b81c31a17c; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; c4370381c14b6166f0c1d70fac8d7d33d64d4ceb; 8907bd21b066bc0192b7bec69c7fce4084bdb06f; be3b36295e5ebb7c4e1f9e3ab53928c7e2214742,Molecular medicine reports,11 2,"

7570fac56dbf41439cc4bee23c30e762f397290a,Association of the use of hearing aids with the incidence and progression of dementia: A longitudinal retrospective study,"Background Hearing aid usage has been linked to improvements in cognition, communication, and socialization, but the extent to which it can affect the onset and progression of dementia is unknown. This study leveraged the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between the use of hearing aids and risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to dementia as well as progression of dementia in hearing-impaired adults. Methods The sample included 977 participants aged >50 with MCI or all-cause dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2018. Participants were classified into four groups according to the definition of the duration of disease stage: Group 1, 450 participants with MCI at baseline that developed dementia during follow up; Group 2, 314 participants diagnosed with dementia at baseline and subsequently died during follow-up; Group 3, 126 healthy participants who were later diagnosed with MCI and then dementia at follow-up; Group 4, 87 participants with MCI at baseline who later converted to dementia and subsequently died during follow-up. Groups 3 and 4 were used to better capture the duration of MCI-to-dementia and dementia-to-death periods. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to assess the effect of hearing aid use on risk of MCI-to-dementia conversion and mortality risk in dementia participants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for confounding. Results Hearing aid users with MCI showed a reduced risk of developing dementia both in Group 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56, 95%CI, 0.45-0.69; false discovery rate [FDR] p <.0001) and Group 3 (HR,0.42; 95%CI, 0.27-0.66; FDR p <.001). The mean progression rate in CDRSB was significantly higher for those who did not use hearing aids (p =.04). Hearing aid usage was also found to influence the progression of dementia. Hearing-aid users with dementia had a lower risk of death, both in Group 2 (HR,0.75; 95%CI, 0.60-0.95; FDR p =.038) and Group 4 (HR,0.53; 95%CI, 0.33-0.89; FDR p =.04).

Most Bayesian designs are defined without explicit considerations of frequentist characteristics. Once the Bayesian design is structured, statisticians use simulations and adjust tuning parameters to comply with a set of targeted operating characteristics. These adjustments affect the use of prior information and utility functions. Here we consider a Bayesian decision theoretic approach for experimental designs with explicit frequentist requisites. We define optimal designs under a set of constraints required by a regulator. Our approach combines the use of interpretable utility functions with frequentist criteria, and selects an optimal design that satisfies a set of required operating characteristics.

While there were no changes in plaque load, or insoluble AÎ² levels in brain, biochemical analysis strongly suggested improved clearance of soluble AÎ², including AÎ² oligomers. To get further insight into molecular mechanisms underlying this therapeutic effect, we explored genome-wide differential gene expression in brain of bexarotene and control treated APP/PS1 mice. We performed high throughput massively parallel sequencing on mRNA libraries generated from cortices of bexarotene or vehicle treated APP/PS1 mice and compared the expression profiles for differential gene expression. Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process categories with the highest fold enrichment and lowest False Discovery Rate (FDR) are clustered in GO terms immune response, inflammatory response, oxidation-reduction and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by ChIP-QPCR, and RT-QPCR expression assays were used to validate select genes, including Trem2, Tyrobp, Apoe and Ttr, differentially expressed in response to Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) activation. We found that bexarotene significantly increased the phagocytosis of soluble and insoluble AÎ² in BV2 cells. The results of our study demonstrate that in AD model mice expressing human APP, gene networks up-regulated in response to RXR activation by the specific, small molecule, ligand bexarotene may influence diverse regulatory pathways that are considered critical for cognitive performance, inflammatory response and AÎ² clearance, and may provide an explanation of the bexarotene therapeutic effect at the molecular level. This study also confirms that unbiased massive parallel sequencing approaches are useful and highly informative for revealing brain molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying responses to activated nuclear hormone receptors in AD animal models.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Iliya Lefterov"", ids = ""4913712""); list(name = ""Jonathan Schug"", ids = ""2993995""); list(name = ""Anais Mounier"", ids = ""49385605""); list(name = ""Kyong Nyon Nam"", ids = ""4759312""); list(name = ""Radosveta Koldamova"", ids = ""6476530"")",8952ad8557eb60527f829e792ec1fa2254ee37e6; 13c434fc14ebec6151d9945299179119fc3563c3; 0917f29a786a5e487dd76646d1976617a3de72f8; ac51af9995edb441f0ce4fdc384908daa6e83675; a2755373223a1fcd45a3c89f25c19796aef7c9e1; 64153f211921400ce1a0a4dc4ea6f1c18756dc04; 6e588a21e156b34e3e085dff30ab7837890111a4; 0f654aa00176df29b071ade012a1e0a011c65a61; af85aac7136898f0c98dcd0e750d15565efe8867; 319bac2f2b305e84af03ad0a96f85053d70bd730; f4e7d0035f2fcb8b37c8585e27f20e2d6ce6066f,,Neurobiology of Disease,82,132-140
fed15c38e99676dff8d81f51c49b7c1762ed5cf6,Altered expression of cytokine signaling pathway genes in peripheral blood cells of alcohol dependent subjects: preliminary findings.,"BACKGROUND
Preclinical and clinical studies have implicated changes in cytokine and innate immune gene-expression in both the development of and end-organ damage resulting from alcohol dependence. However, these changes have not been systematically assessed on the basis of alcohol consumption in human subjects.


METHODS
Illumina Sentrix Beadchip (Human-6v2) microarrays were used to measure levels of gene-expression in peripheral blood in 3 groups of subjects: those with alcohol dependence (AD, n = 12), heavy drinkers (HD; defined as regular alcohol use over the past year of at least 8 standard drinks/wk for women and at least 15 standard drinks/wk for men, n = 13), and moderate drinkers (MD; defined as up to 7 standard drinks/wk for women and 14 standard drinks/wk for men, n = 17).


RESULTS
Four hundred and thirty-six genes were differentially expressed among the 3 groups of subjects (false discovery rate corrected p-value < 0.05). Two hundred and ninety-one genes differed between AD and MD subjects, 240 differed between AD and HD subjects, but only 6 differed between HD and MD subjects. Pathway analysis using DAVID and GeneGO Metacore(Â®) software showed that the most affected pathways were those related to T-cell receptor and Janus kinase-Signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-Stat) signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest the transition from heavy alcohol use to dependence is accompanied by changes in the expression of genes involved in regulation of the innate immune response. Such changes may underlie some of the previously described changes in immune function associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Early detection of these changes may allow individuals at high risk for dependence to be identified.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Beech"", ids = ""2201059""); list(name = ""Jie Qu"", ids = ""32373274""); list(name = ""Janine J.

Population differences are commonly observed for many complex traits including response to chemotherapy. These differences may be attributed to the combined effect of socioeconomic, environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors. Indeed, genome-wide genetic and gene expression differences have been reported among different ethnic populations. Furthermore, we have previously reported population differences in cellular sensitivity to carboplatin, daunorubicin and ara-C and have established that both genetic variants and gene expression contribute to these observed population differences. Here we set out to evaluate to what extent population differences may be explained by an epigenetic factor, namely microRNA (miRNA) expression. We characterized genome-wide miRNA expression in unrelated 54 CEU (Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry) and 55 YRI (African from Ibadan, Nigeria) HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) using the Exiqon miRCURYTM LNA arrays and evaluated baseline mRNA expression using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Exon 1.0 ST array. Forty-one miRNA expression traits were found to differ significantly between these 2 ethnic groups (pBonferroni corrected<0.05). The potential biological function of these observed differentially expressed miRNAs was explored by examining their relationship with mRNA expression and cellular sensitivity to carboplatin, daunorubicin and cytaribin. After multiple testing adjustment (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.1), we identified 25 and 32 of the 41 differentially expressed miRNAs that were significantly correlated with 530 and 729 mRNA expression levels in the CEU and YRI samples, respectively. Among them, six differentially expressed miRNAs showed significant levels of correlation with 6 differentially expressed mRNAs (FDR<0.1). A substantial proportion (63%) of these miRNAs correlated with cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (FDR<0.05). Lastly, upon performing a genome-wide association study between SNPs and miRNA expression, we identified a large number of SNPs showing high levels of population differentiation that affected the expression of these differentially expressed miRNAs, suggesting the role of genetic variants in mediating the observed population differences. In conclusion, the differentially expressed miRNAs we catalog in this study may explain observed population differences in mRNA expression and cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Heterogeneity of Gene Expression in Bovine Small Follicles,"Small antral follicles 5 mm there is upregulation in expression of focimatrix genes and later upregulation of the LH receptor and steroidogenic enzymes, especially aromatase, in the granulosa cells. For follicles at sizes >5 mm entering atresia the granulosa cells are the first in the follicle to die. Thus expression of genes in granulosa cells is critical to the fate of the follicle. To examine granulosa cells of small follicles we collected bovine ovaries and dissected follicles, removed part of the follicle wall for subsequent classification of health or atresia, and harvested the remaining granulosa cells for RNA isolation. Follicles examined included small follicles ( 10 mm, n = 4). RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome Arrays and the results were analysed using Partek Genomics Suite software. The number of genes which were 2 fold differentially regulated between large and small follicles by Benjamini Hochberg post hoc test (False Discovery Rate, P < 0.05) was 2408 and between healthy and atretic small follicles was 4931. The coefficient of variation (CV; SD/mean Ã— 100) for the expression level of each gene for each group was calculated. A gene frequency distribution indicated greater heterogeneity in expression levels in small follicles in comparison to large follicles. Furthermore, the greatest variability in genes in small follicles includes those that are either up or down regulated due to atresia or growth. We therefore conclude that variability in small follicles is a consequence of alternative fates that small follicle can undergo.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Nicholas Hatzirodos"", ids = ""4951792""); list(name = ""Helen F.

1b9f86be33687c4899d05be92f001a5a88c336df,Characterizing the efficacy of fermented wheat germ extract against ovarian cancer and defining the genomic basis of its activity.,"OBJECTIVE
Most women with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (OVCA) ultimately develop chemoresistant recurrent disease. Therefore, a great need to develop new, more active, and less toxic agents and/or to optimize the efficacy of existing agents exists.


METHODS
In this study, we investigated the activity of Avemar, a natural, nontoxic, fermented wheat germ extract (FWGE), against a range of OVCA cell lines, both alone and in combination with cisplatin chemotherapy and delineated the molecular signaling pathways that underlie FWGE activity at a genome-wide level.


RESULTS
We found that FWGE exhibited significant antiproliferative effects against 12 human OVCA cell lines and potentiated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Pearson correlation of FWGE sensitivity and gene expression data identified 2142 genes (false discovery rate < 0.2) representing 27 biologic pathways (P < 0.05) to be significantly associated with FWGE sensitivity. A parallel analysis of genomic data for 59 human cancer cell lines matched to chemosensitivity data for 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone, a proposed active component of FWGE, identified representation of 13 pathways common to both FWGE and 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone sensitivity.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings confirm the value of FWGE as a natural product with anticancer properties that may also enhance the activity of existing therapeutic agents. Furthermore, our findings provide substantial insights into the molecular basis of FWGE's effect on human cancer cells.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Patricia L.

We tested associations between genetically determined telomere length and aging-related health outcomes in a large European ancestry older cohort. Data were from nÂ =Â 379,758 UK Biobank participants aged 40-70, followed up for mean of 7.5Â years (nÂ =Â 261,837 participants aged 60 and older by end of follow-up). Thirteen variants strongly associated with longer telomere length in peripheral white blood cells were analyzed using Mendelian randomization methods with Egger plots to assess pleiotropy. Variants in TERC, TERT, NAF1, OBFC1, and RTEL1 were included, and estimates were per 250 base pairs increase in telomere length, approximately equivalent to the average change over a decade in the general white population. We highlighted associations with false discovery rate-adjusted p-values smaller thanÂ .05. Genetically determined longer telomere length was associated with lowered risk of coronary heart disease (CHD; ORÂ =Â 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98) but raised risk of cancer (ORÂ =Â 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.16). Little evidence for associations were found with parental lifespan, centenarian status of parents, cognitive function, grip strength, sarcopenia, or falls. The results for those aged 60 and older were similar in younger or all participants. Genetically determined telomere length was associated with increased risk of cancer and reduced risk of CHD but little change in other age-related health outcomes.

6b826ac58708c6fe53392e5c96405bfc4754d997,Association between the serotonin 2A receptor gene and bipolar affective disorder in an Australian cohort.,"OBJECTIVE
The serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A) is involved in serotonergic neurotransmission, and has been targeted as a functional candidate for mood disorders because of the extensive support for the involvement of serotonin in mood regulation. We previously reported linkage evidence for a bipolar affective disorder susceptibility locus on chromosome 13q, which harbours HTR2A, thus making the gene both a positional and functional candidate. We assessed HTR2A for association in an Australian bipolar disorder case-control cohort.


METHODS
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected across HTR2A exons and introns, and were investigated for association in an Australian cohort of 218 cases and 166 healthy controls. SNP haplotypes were also examined for association.


RESULTS
Significant association of rs2224721 (P = 0.02) and borderline significance of rs1923886 (P = 0.05) were observed. The former remained significant after multiple testing corrections using the rough False Discovery Rate method, but did not exceed the more conservative Bonferroni's correction threshold. Haplotype association analysis suggests that the haplotype CCGCA (at SNPs rs3125, rs6314, rs1923886, rs2224721 and rs2770296) is protective against bipolar disorder (P = 0.021, odds ratio 0.63) and the rarer haplotype CCACG confers risk to the disorder (P = 0.0065, odds ratio 3.08).


CONCLUSION
We found that HTR2A is associated with bipolar disorder. The HTR2A gene should not be excluded as a potential susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder despite a number of conflicting association results.",2009,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Erica Z.

19c7d65eff2de5104ecb5df5ffb09255de22895c,P190-S Statistical Significance of Differential Proteome Expression.,"Differential proteome studies are a powerful tool for the analysis of differences between two sample states. A challenge encountered in any proteome study is the reproducibility of the sample preparation and data analysis. The significance analysis of the results and the extent to which changes can reliably be detected are affected by this. 
 
We studied the changes of the proteome during cell differentiation using a combination of large format 2D gel electrophoresis, image analysis, and mass spectrometry. 
 
The basis for any analysis is the reproducibility of the results and the study design. Firstly, the reproducibility of large-format 2D gel electrophoresis was shown. Two samples of the same patient were analyzed using three replicate gels each. The spot quantitation of the two samples was found to be in good agreement. The relative mean standard deviation of the spot intensities within the replicate gels was 20% coefficient of variance. This allows us to analyze changes in the protein spot intensity that are smaller than a factor of two. The study design was optimized in order to account for technical and biological variation. 
 
In the main study, 1800â€“2000 spots were quantified per gel. The large patient heterogeneity did not allow us to use a strict fold-change criterion for the selection of significantly changed spots between the two sample states. The variation of the spot intensity in one patient group was very much dependent on the nature of each individual protein. Therefore, a studentâ€™s t-test was employed to calculate the statistical significance for each spot. A total of 31 protein spots were found to be changed upon differentiation. Of these, 17 spots were unique for one of the samples, and another 14 spots were found to be highly significant (P = 99.9%). The effect of the Bonferroni correction and the false discovery rate is evaluated.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Andreas Wattenberg"", ids = ""46374734""); list(name = ""Petra Lutter"", ids = ""49635849""); list(name = ""Martin BlÃ¼ggel"", ids = ""3336010"")",,,Journal of biomolecular techniques,18,66-66
9cc2c68aeae23f60cf2f5981042b51da7dda1390,Topological changes of the brain functional network during performance of self-initiated movement in PD patients,"Introduction Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulty in performing self-initiated movements. The ability to initiate movements, particularly those that are internally generated or sequentially structured, is a function of the premotor areas in the medial wall of the frontal lobe including the supplementary motor area (SMA) [1]. In PD patients, functional imaging with tasks requiring motor initiation identified defective activation of the SMA [2]. Although the relationship between the dysfunction of SMA and the defect of self-initiated movements in PD patients has been well established, little has been known about how the dysfunction of SMA affected the whole functional network during movement. In this study, we used fMRI and complex network analysis based on graph theory to investigate the topological changes of the brain networks during performance of self-initiated movement in PD patients. Materials and Methods fMRIs were acquired in 17 PD patients and 19 age-matched normal controls, when performing a self-initiated finger-thumb opposition task. Imaging was performed using a whole-body 1.5T Signa GE scanner. A series of preprocessing steps common to most fMRI analyses was conducted using the SPM8 software. After the preprocessing, a two-sample t-test was used to detect the activation differences between patients and normal controls. Compared with the patients, control group showed significant activation in the right SMA (p<0.005, uncorrected). The time series of BOLD signal change in the right SMA was extracted and correlated with that from other brain regions. The voxel with the correlation coefficient survived from a correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 0.1% as a threshold was reserved. All clusters with at least 10 contiguous such voxels constituted the SMA-related functional network. Each cluster was considered as a node in the network. Then, the mask of the constructed network was copied to each subject. Mean time-series from each node were de-correlated for movement parameters and cross-correlated to construct a correlation matrix. In the matrix, the correlation coefficient represented the functional connectivity strength between any two nodes in the network. Each correlation matrix was thresholded into a binarized matrix with a wide range of sparsity (30%-50%) at the interval of 0.01. Finally, network parameters of each subject were calculated from the connectivity matrices and compared between the patient and control group. Normalized clustering coefficient (Î³), normalized shortest path length (Î»), global efficiency (Eglob), and local efficiency (Eloc ) were calculated to determine the global characteristics of the SMA-related functional network. Nodal degree (Ki), nodal efficiency (Enod) and nodal betweenness centrality (Nbc) of each node were calculated and integrated into a normalized nodal parameter Ï‡norm to determine the hub of the functional network. Result The SMA-related functional network consisted of 19 nodes which mainly located in the frontal lobe, occipital lobe and the limbic system (Table 1). There was no significant difference on the global network parameters (Î³, Î», Eglob and Eloc) between the PD patients and normal controls. However, the hubs of these two networks were different (Fig 1). In the normal controls, the hubs were the right SMA, the left hippocampus, the left posterior cingulated and the right precuneus. In the PD patients, right SMA was no longer the hub, whereas left middle occipital gyrus and the right superior occipital gyrus were new hubs of the function network.",2011,,"list(name = ""XiaoJun Xu"", ids = ""31482070""); list(name = ""Dan Long"", ids = ""48811778""); list(name = ""Minming Zhang"", ids = ""40205557"")",,,,,
ff7534588059ab86eaf853ef89896ad40ca9e823,Exploiting Linkage Disequilibrium for Ultrahigh-Dimensional Genome-Wide Data with an Integrated Statistical Approach.,"Genome-wide data with millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). The ultrahigh dimensionality of big data brings unprecedented challenges to statistical modeling such as noise accumulation, the curse of dimensionality, computational burden, spurious correlations, and a processing and storing bottleneck. The traditional statistical approaches lose their power due to [Formula: see text] (n is the number of observations and p is the number of SNPs) and the complex correlation structure among SNPs. In this article, we propose an integrated distance correlation ridge regression (DCRR) approach to accommodate the ultrahigh dimensionality, joint polygenic effects of multiple loci, and the complex LD structures. Initially, a distance correlation (DC) screening approach is used to extensively remove noise, after which LD structure is addressed using a ridge penalized multiple logistic regression (LRR) model. The false discovery rate, true positive discovery rate, and computational cost were simultaneously assessed through a large number of simulations. A binary trait of Arabidopsis thaliana, the hypersensitive response to the bacterial elicitor AvrRpm1, was analyzed in 84 inbred lines (28 susceptibilities and 56 resistances) with 216,130 SNPs. Compared to previous SNP discovery methods implemented on the same data set, the DCRR approach successfully detected the causative SNP while dramatically reducing spurious associations and computational time.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michelle Carlsen"", ids = ""13026049""); list(name = ""Guifang Fu"", ids = ""37839912""); list(name = ""Shaun B.

37e76e442ed6127d172258eb2a262e040b341fc0,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Is a Bcl-2 Dependent Disease: Proteomic Profiling and Pre-Clinical Efficacy Of a Selective Bcl-2 Antagonist ABT-199,"The expression of Bcl-2 family proteins is perturbed in multiple types of cancers, including leukemias, and is associated with disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy. ABT-199 (GDC-0199) is a new BH3 mimetic that was developed to specifically target Bcl-2 while sparing Bcl-XL, hence avoiding thrombocytopenia intrinsic to 1st generation BH3 mimetics like ABT-737 (Souers et al., Nat Med, 2013). In this study, we report proteomic profiling of Bcl-2 family members in a large series of ALL patients (pts) and pre-clinical activity of ABT-199.

Expression of 20 pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins was studied in 186 newly diagnosed ALL using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA). Supervised clustering demonstrated distinct differences in 11 proteins in ALL with different cytogenetic and FAB characteristics ([Fig. 1][1], p<0.005, false discovery rate <0.2%). Among these, pts with Burkitt's leukemia/lymphoma (n=9) expressed low levels of Bcl-2 and Bax while maintaining high expression of Bim, caspases and PARP. In contrast, t(4;11) pts expressed higher levels of Bcl-2, Bax and Bim. No significant differences in Bcl-XL or Mcl-1 levels were found in different ALL subtypes.

The potential of ABT-199 to disrupt interactions between Bcl-2 and different pro-apoptotic proteins was studied using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC, J Biol Chem 288:4935, 2013 ). The coding sequences for human Bcl-2, Bim, Bak, Bax and Noxa were subcloned into BiFC plasmids containing Venus fragments and transfected into HeLa cells. Approximately 60-70% of transfected cells were positive for Venus fluorescence due to association between Bcl-2 and Bim, Noxa, Bax or Bak. ABT-199 (2.5 ÂµM, 24 hrs) significantly reduced Venus signal, indicating an inhibition of the interactions of Bcl-2 with these proteins, most potently with the multidomain proteins Bax and Bak (95%Â±18% and 85%Â±15% inhibition, respectively). ABT-199 rapidly induced apoptotic cell death in ALL cell lines and in primary ALL samples. Pre-B ALL cells (Nalm-6, REH, SEMK2 and RS4;11) were sensitive to ABT-199 and ABT-737 (IC50 0.007-1.4ÂµM (199) and 0.035-0.7ÂµM (737)). Notably, ABT-199 was more cytotoxic than ABT-737 against MLL-rearranged SEMK2 and RS4;11 cells, consistent with the notion of the greater Bcl-2 dependency of these cells. Lentiviral silencing of Bcl-XL sensitized REH cells to apoptosis by ABT-199 and ABT-737. T-ALL cells (PF-382, MOLT-4, P-12) expressed lower levels of Bcl-2 and were uniformly less sensitive to ABT-199 compared to ABT-737 (IC50 3.7Â±1.1ÂµM vs 0.7Â±0.3ÂµM, p=0.01). Burkitt's lymphoma cells Ramos and Raji had low Bcl-2 and high Mcl-1 expression, and were resistant to both agents (IC50>4ÂµM).

Next, the cytotoxic activity of ABT-199 was tested against a panel of 12 genetically diverse primary ALL samples, including 6 from pts with relapsed or refractory disease. Ten out of twelve samples (83%) were exquisitely sensitive to both agents, with IC50 values of 0.0001-0.14ÂµM for ABT-199 and 0.0004-0.3ÂµM for ABT-737. One of the four Ph+ samples was resistant to both agents, and one of the two T-ALL was less sensitive to ABT-199 compared to ABT-737. Two samples with t(4;11) were highly sensitive to ABT-199. All primary ALL samples tested (n=7) expressed high levels of Bcl-2, and no significant correlation between sensitivity and expression of Bcl-2 family members was found. Importantly, three human-derived xenografts from pediatric pre-B-ALL samples (1345, 1809, 0398) were very sensitive to ABT-199 (IC50 3nM, 0.1nM and 2.3nM, respectively). Finally, anti-leukemia activity of ABT-199 was tested in MLL-rearranged patient-derived xenograft NSG mice. Treatment with ABT-199 at 100mg/kg/d by oral gavage days 13-23 significantly reduced leukemia tumor burden as determined by bioluminescence imaging (average 70% reduction in BLI signal in 4 ABT-treated mice compared to 4 control animals at 9 weeks, p=0.03).

In summary, proteomic profiling and patterns of sensitivity to Bcl-2 inhibition indicate that ALL, with exception of Burkitt's lymphoma, represents a Bcl-2 dependent disease. These results provide strong rationale for introducing ABT-199, which recently showed impressive efficacy in CLL trials, into the clinical armamentarium of ALL therapy.

Fifty-two noncontrast (NC), 26 corticomedullary (CM) phase, and 35 nephrographic (NG) phase CTs of small (<â€‰4 cm) surgically resected ccRCCs were retrospectively identified. Surgical pathology classified the tumors as low- or high-Fuhrman histologic grade. The axial image with the largest cross-sectional tumor area was exported and segmented. Six histogram and 31 texture (gray-level co-occurrences (GLC) and gray-level run-lengths (GLRL)) features were calculated for each tumor in each phase. T testing compared feature values in low- and high-grade ccRCCs, with a (Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg) false discovery rate of 10%. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was calculated for each feature to assess prediction of low- and high-grade ccRCCs in each phase. Histogram, texture, and combined histogram and texture data sets were used to train and test four algorithms (k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forests, and decision tree) with tenfold cross-validation; AUCs were calculated for each algorithm in each phase to assess prediction of low- and high-grade ccRCCs. Zero, 23, and 0 features in the NC, CM, and NG phases had statistically significant differences between low and high-grade ccRCCs. CM histogram skewness and GLRL short run emphasis had the highest AUCs (0.82) in predicting histologic grade. All four algorithms had the highest AUCs (0.97) predicting histologic grade using CM histogram features. The algorithmsâ€™ AUCs decreased using histogram or texture features from NC or NG phases. The histologic grade of small ccRCCs can be accurately predicted with machine learning algorithms using CM histogram features, which outperform NC and NG phase image data.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shawn Haji-Momenian"", ids = ""1403466878""); list(name = ""Zi-xian Lin"", ids = ""145972567""); list(name = ""Bhumi Patel"", ids = ""1454003640""); list(name = ""Nicole Law"", ids = ""1454023516""); list(name = ""Adam Michalak"", ids = ""1454023196""); list(name = ""Anishsanjay Nayak"", ids = ""46364783""); list(name = ""James P.

d4536631f2eb664840c7fc4502d3106211a42419,Characterization of the longissimus lumborum transcriptome response to adding propionate to the diet of growing Angus beef steers.,"Development of management paradigms that enhance the rate of gain and qualitative characteristics of beef carcass development has the potential to impact production and nutrient use efficiency but also mitigate losses to the environment. We used eight Black Angus beef steers (272.5 Â± 17.6 kg initial body wt) fed a forage-based pelleted diet alone (n = 4) or supplemented with sodium propionate included (n = 4) for 42 days. High-quality RNA was extracted from the longissimus lumborum and subjected to transcriptome sequencing using RNA-seq technology. Trimmed reads were aligned to the bovine reference genome (Btau4.0, release 63) and uniquely mapped reads from control and propionate treatment groups were subject to further analysis using edgeR. Candidates were filtered to account for multiple testing and differentially expressed genes (153 at a false discovery rate of <5%) were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis (GOseq) to select terms where enrichment had occurred. Significant GO terms included regulation of cholesterol transport, regulation of sterol transport, and cellular modified amino acid metabolic process. Furthermore, the top four identified gene networks included lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, carbohydrate metabolism, and molecular transport-related categories. Notably, changes in lipid metabolism specific genes reflect both increased oxidative and lipid synthetic capacities. Metabolism-related gene changes are reflective of expected enhancements in lean tissue accretion patterns exhibited in steers where high ruminal propionate relative to other short chain fatty acids is observed.

5928bc511483559ecbd8471b3958db1eebfeccb4,Specific Enrichment and Proteomics Analysis of Escherichia coli Persisters from Rifampin Pretreatment.,"Bacterial persisters, a dormant and multidrug tolerant subpopulation that are able to resuscitate after antibiotic treatment, have recently received considerable attention as a major cause of relapse of various infectious diseases in the clinic. However, because of their low abundance and inherent transience, it is extremely difficult to study them by proteomics. Here we developed a magnetic-beads-based separation approach to enrich Escherichia coli persisters and then subjected them to shotgun proteomics. Rifampin pretreatment was employed to increase persister formation, and the resulting cells were exposed to a high concentration of ampicillin (10Ã— MIC) to remove nonpersisters. The survivors were analyzed by spectral counting-based quantitative proteomics. On average, 710 proteins were identified at a false discovery rate of 0.01 for enriched E. coli persisters. By spectral counting-based quantification, 105 proteins (70 down-regulated, 35 up-regulated) were shown to be differentially expressed compared with normal cells. A comparison of the differentially expressed proteins between the magnetic beads-enriched persisters and nonenriched persisters (a mixture of persisters and intact dead cells) shows only around half (âˆ¼58%) overlap and different protein-protein interaction networks. This suggest that persister enrichment is important to eliminate the cumulative effect of dead cells that will obscure the proteome of persisters. As expected, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid and amino acid biosynthesis, and bacterial chemotaxis were found to be down-regulated in the persisters. Interestingly, membrane proteins including some transport proteins were up-regulated, indicating that they might be important for the drug tolerance of persisters. Knockout of the pal gene expressing peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, one of the most up-regulated proteins detected in persisters, led to 10-fold reduced persister formation under ampicillin treatment.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jordy Evan Sulaiman"", ids = ""51476082""); list(name = ""Chunlin Hao"", ids = ""38606749""); list(name = ""Henry Lam"", ids = ""48382817"")",6b9058c17a5953918a7ce1ea003a3eb2037ca6f6; 5e7f8cf36bf83041423fc51cbeb0020c074c1545; 718cdb489a31d270c3d10d609301726a1ccf3342; 6a153e9f2da785be8cf7aa0980523c34d8d76f19; be4fcbca21dd3ebe91f33c67947c6fc90878592d; 95f8abd5a4e2ffa6a62e4ba077f440c2a7c4048d,,Journal of proteome research,17 11,"

f3da5c42ef43565afc88808d7bab45f645cf9587,Title Association of the rs 3743205 variant of DYX 1 C 1 with dyslexia inChinese children,"Background: Dyslexia is a learning disability that is characterized by difficulties in the acquisition of reading and spelling skills independent of intelligence, motivation or schooling. Studies of western populations have suggested that DYX1C1 is a candidate gene for dyslexia. In view of the different languages used in Caucasian and Chinese populations, it is therefore worthwhile to investigate whether there is an association of DYX1C1 in Chinese children with dyslexia. Method and Results: Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped from three hundred and ninety three individuals from 131 Chinese families with two which have been reported in the literature and six tag SNPs at DYX1C1. Analysis for allelic and haplotypic associations was performed with the UNPHASED program and multiple testing was corrected using false discovery rates. We replicated the previously reported association of rs3743205 in Chinese children with dyslexia (pcorrected = 0.0072). This SNP was also associated with rapid naming, phonological memory and orthographic skills in quantitative trait analysis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that DYX1C1 is associated with dyslexia in people of Chinese ethnicity in Hong Kong.",2011,,"list(name = ""Cadmon KP Lim"", ids = ""29480673""); list(name = ""Connie Suk-han Ho"", ids = ""3234452""); list(name = ""Crystal HN Chou"", ids = ""30308733""); list(name = ""Mary Miu Yee Waye"", ids = ""144520740"")",4adf7134d6dff9823ebd2710f3cbd26cb2983adc; 8f7779c7e4114ec137788e8c620c99fa227640e2,736fe980f33c272f39a6ab768af9a5413faa5388; aafc97f01fbf2a5b3cda2a208779ad24477fd867; fe64ae183b8f5ab6dee51a92903b7cc637499f4d; 8b5f7fcb4d1d4ed46b1cefe52a8526d3c3fecaee; dae9def1a8d9525c93eda893efd426cc3d1de592; dde0323bc66f5d28d4aa7a1079274ccf23bcfaf0; 411c48371ddcda4e508f67d40bb74ca9a20b84ae; 781f5cc138badbc76e34e673f9de0c1cbefc8c3a; ed1cae865579b62d9444b1058b3d5771ea33c5e3; d293631389d68058dc65da0f7716319abdcba037; decba287fca249f7bf570e4de890ec5b85457808; 29e572c683d8b1c081e40e44794f575003d998d0; 961f6b04e769ba341afcab0af84d1160483cddd3; 594e21b2d12630ab34b4882933aa6e81e5796e30; 0decec68c01619062ee6603140fdf7f3240302c7; 25052510428b39be3ebd6740897751c9532fff5b; 72db9580b13f096f7301686b0ca250ee7511957e; a15683afdee3bc13f4f9023ad09a47a917c01039; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 6b486493f5c884c95081dd3b7a247487d6227d18; b54835a93f9c286c13da882cad51430cfe3e2d8d; 9eef29c14271014d096ad26e8fcc7104bb2065e7; a2f1eefed58ee841da4f850185e5fba001a52fc5; 0f6f2c2a4f1b2b0e171224b9fc354e2148de72bf; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 862d655343e54879936014c1c14c2ce0fe241e52; 7a1cac4c97b8702dbc12864cdfbda35797b5b034; 262f685c455f0e20a547a38cd70d619766f6e2be; 4a69f5d664c952ad4b2fe50b29f8d24f14fe3099; 5ec87db7363e93af2acf876f9c53d33a4b700b07; 0eb7501594de19f3a7b537103d69335437bd4fdd; 7fb9e45d7c395a7df3009362d2c556745b65c3c7; 08dfaf3fb8c421a81afb3fda78f1828fef6f17ae; 216cee5dddf301302074e67039d915f39c7d9cf8; cf1cbbf3bdba2eea2e62b9e237d039191da93e57; 36f7eded539880cd68b8a38ab590bef24ff3e558; 7102e33a2d15d3763537c28a9ffb38ed2a891f6d; 6c50b11546b35e326093ec5d23469937f0e4356e; e69eefe0913d5224ae1944865c0e33cba3e3ec18; f34338c9de05fe2fabfa80fa3fa4cc4f4a8c3798; 26bd716d65164aa9edef2793cde2be1b0c105da2,,,

We used logistic regression fitted with the generalized estimation equation to test associations between a dichotomous phenotype and all genotyped common and rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition to the association study, we also developed and applied a simple and fast identical-by-descent-based test to identify loci that were shared among affected individuals more often than expected by chance. Among the top significant loci, we assessed the statistical power and the false discovery rate of both methods. We also demonstrated that family-based studies, compared with the standard population-based association studies, have great values and advantages for the discovery of multiple rare causal variants.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tian Xiang Liu"", ids = ""98175886""); list(name = ""Anbupalam Thalamuthu"", ids = ""47149962"")",fc3279630396a3534d3d12fa3e6b9e64ba3c7a32,b824fd423120321b39e1148a5f88d20054b9f0c7; 3772d06c12a57584eddb3eb55ce8b0cfbc05a1d0; eaf538b689bde80a566260624e3fbb5c1410ae54; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9f96169ea4cbd294bc3dcf3ed590e1ce8d0747fd; 98551f518c3dcb013bfe1325374c90f5b82d4bd9; e8041e6f7eaf7b1784598b7f60ccb94eb879ac19; 2fcb901f46c42bc28e1514e023b7d9e5379cd2dc,BMC Proceedings,5,S31 - S31
f95a7971ab455fe78da5b48a6ad5b98d8066da36,Bioinformatics Thousands of Cis-Regulatory Sequence Combinations Are Shared by Arabidopsis and Poplar 1 [ C ] [ W ] [ OA ],"The identification of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) can greatly advance our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms. Despite the existence of binding sites of more than three transcription factors (TFs) in a CRM, studies in plants often consider only the cooccurrence of binding sites of one or two TFs. In addition, CRM studies in plants are limited to combinations of only a few families of TFs. It is thus not clear how widespread plant TFs work together, which TFs work together to regulate plant genes, and how the combinations of these TFs are shared by different plants. To fill these gaps, we applied a frequent patternmining-based approach to identify frequently used cis-regulatory sequence combinations in the promoter sequences of two plant species, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). A cis-regulatory sequence here corresponds to a DNA motif bound by a TF. We identified 18,638 combinations composed of two to six cis-regulatory sequences that are shared by the two plant species. In addition, with known cis-regulatory sequence combinations, gene function annotation, gene expression data, and known functional gene sets, we showed that the functionality of at least 96.8% and 65.2% of these shared combinations in Arabidopsis are partially supported, under a false discovery rate of 0.1 and 0.05, respectively.

447712448c23f5867113ddceba0183a09c4dbe2b,Differential Gene Expression Profile Identifies the Nature of T Cell Defects in AML Patients at Diagnosis.,"Contrary to expectation, we have shown that the absolute number of T cells in the peripheral blood of patients presenting with AML is higher than that of healthy individuals (p=0.0006). Previous publications have demonstrated that in vitro the microenvironment in AML is immunosuppressive to healthy T cell function (Buggins et al. 2001). To analyze the molecular nature of T cell defects in patients with AML, we performed global gene expression profiling of peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T cells from 10 AML patients compared to that of 21 healthy volunteers. The purity of the CD4 T cells was 86% in AML and 94% in healthy donors and 92% for AML and 87% in healthy donors for CD8 T cells. cRNA was hybridised on Affymetrix U133Plus2 chips using standard protocols. Samples were normalised using the MAS5 algorithm and subsequent analysis using Bioconductor software indicated marked differences between the gene expression profiles of CD4 and CD8 T cells from AML patients compared with normal individuals. Using a false discovery rate of 0.01 and fold change greater than 2, 1407 genes were found to be differentially regulated for CD4 and 779 genes for CD8. There was a large overlap in the two gene lists. The microarray data was validated using real-time quantitative PCR. Initial pathway analysis using Ingenuity software indicated many genes involved in cell proliferation, cell death and gene expression. Molecular defects in T cells from AML patients show marked differences from those we have already noted in T cells from patients with CLL. Only 2% of genes for CD4 and 6% of genes for CD8 are differentially regulated in T cells from both AML and CLL patients. These data suggest a different molecular basis for the T cell defects in these disease types. However, 2 genes downregulated in CD8 T cells in AML patients, ACTN1 and FILIP1 suggested impaired actin cytoskeletal activity may contribute to immune dysfunction in AML T cells as we have already demonstrated in CLL. We therefore tested the ability of AML CD4 and CD8 T cells to form intact immunological synapses (IS) with autologous AML blasts in the presence or absence of superantigen. F-actin was visualised with rhodamine phalloidin and recruitment of activated T cell receptor mediated signalling molecules was detected using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Conjugate and synapse formation and phosphotyrosine signalling was assessed by confocal microscopy with at least 50 random conjugates analyzed. Unlike CLL B cells, AML blasts can act as antigen presenting cells (APCs) for conjugate and IS formation with healthy T cells. Again, in contrast to CLL, AML T cells are able to form conjugates with autologous tumour cells but demonstrate impaired IS formation and, in CD8 T cells, decreased phosphotyrosine signalling at the synapse site. This data indicates that T cells in patients presenting with AML are abnormal in terms of their gene expression profile and although they retain the ability to conjugate with autologous blasts, reduced polarisation of F-actin to form immune synapses is seen. We are currently investigating if these changes are induced directly by tumour cells and the functional consequences of the gene expression changes identified. The ability of AML blasts to function as APCs for IS formation is in keeping with the observed GVL effect in this disease. Understanding the nature of T cell defects in patients presenting with AML is fundamental before successful autologous immunotherapeutic strategies can be implemented.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Rifca Le Dieu"", ids = ""66233086""); list(name = ""Alan G Ramsay"", ids = ""47020896""); list(name = ""David Taussig"", ids = ""49295542""); list(name = ""Richard Mitter"", ids = ""3748226""); list(name = ""John G.

BSCCs develop in OSF that are often not completely resected, causing local relapse. The aim of our study was to find candidate protein biomarkers to detect OSF and predict prognosis in BSCCs by quantitative proteomics approaches.MethodsWe compared normal oral mucosa (NBM) and paired biopsies of BSCC and OSF by quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) to discover proteins with differential expression. Gene Ontology and KEGG networks were analyzed. The prognostic value of biomarkers was evaluated in 94 BSCCs accompanied with OSF. Significant associations were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox-proportional hazards analysis.ResultsIn total 30 proteins were identified with significantly different expression (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05) among three tissues. Two consistently upregulated proteins, ANXA4 and FLNA, were validated. The disease-free survival was negatively associated with the expression of ANXA4 (hazard ratio, 3.4; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000), FLNA (hazard ratio, 2.1; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.000) and their combination (hazard ratio, 8.8; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002) in BSCCs.ConclusionThe present study indicates that iTRAQ quantitative proteomics analysis for tissues of BSCC and OSF is a reliable strategy. A significantly up-regulated ANXA4 and FLNA could be not only candidate biomarkers for BSCC prognosis but also potential targets for its therapy.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wen Bin Liu"", ids = ""2289777""); list(name = ""Lijuan Zeng"", ids = ""48973128""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""144419332""); list(name = ""Fei Wang"", ids = ""1682816""); list(name = ""Canhua Jiang"", ids = ""34379315""); list(name = ""Feng Guo"", ids = ""145703452""); list(name = ""Xinqun Chen"", ids = ""6045636""); list(name = ""Tong Su"", ids = ""2705389""); list(name = ""Chunjiao Xu"", ids = ""3208458""); list(name = ""Shanshan Zhang"", ids = ""35514652""); list(name = ""C Fang"", ids = ""4927139"")",98bf0b36123c520621a98c9920ffe2114c943e1a,d8cfe13568a02e8a5b4aed7446e1aee795d24feb; dede5e25e086390ca423406354fa109f526b654f; 3201bfb29569f117a36e9e0b7f7c3aba8918e575; 207cd8a31a62a9278b6fc7b021a47373a9e3e5e8; 71a4f5306a1e2d44928b8b437662e07e445a3679; 1c07c1cef0f2a040262cd8cc6390e2c5b5b562e6; 35d143c1ae04852f1a85c75c32c89ec391de5d76; 0f93785e28e8d33ab6b7dd2a1c080d0c82d69615; c9cd53f1a6da91f4e705586fda28809367dc449d; c0b292f8bdcfe4232fa060374c190aa0934c1ac8; eb69fc3e63086cbf16fa156eef314d187ca0832b; 2eed47d04210b15f23bf192f4b711fb7f05f2101; 376e08ec3b1b87cb1d1b8f92f50ffa754e87a68e; 02414e9316612e0253ff58eb681f9bff59711239; d32f93ced0ba660cf39c200b0186882ab1a149d1; 6650cf46239b12bd046dccc18847485673099d12; 3ba4726d74979fe3ace45c6e44b62b396d092eaf; 7c707f7986102de48fa544dcf8576c670e8b845c; f55fa5f31095fb15f3f17be89ad1b66c3a75f991; 954155ba57f34af0db5477aed4a4fa5f0ccf4933; eb510fe754fb3b59be3d5b11642a3fdc15750e6a; 1d5a27d3fb76ef797c7d41cdc89ccf59ffefa2e5; 776c51113d53a573f14dec12b15c171b37b2cd26; d835a29982734ac7bd4ad959644212c5fa388233; 8ba2a57bbd0381409b82e51277df1437bcca3abe; 6c626de02a84ea1ea1138bf73f9377946fb25ea7; 0e5312bb2528562e9d30a04f2651b94da318051f; d84be775356d37ea44a36de1356bd05c594415d3; 0eaed63940b81cdb6d8c0972370b6abe48c5e4b3; c6bdce7f2be2a27649f29721d2081e1f8c07449b; 3d7baacfe68fffb6b777b176d796fd066fdd6ee7; 56cdebf2c2112ccc495e8d47b34bda37d9a36184; 5740b17d23942b46e604ff5017d29ea8f4ca7544; d9c0bdec14ee9265d56dcac860820acfaf3e6c0a; 3c241924ee03c5e0cda8e79b21310efe9bf5cbf4; 1f7521767f0206f72e0cd63d0a9f770e7013bda5; 8a70f2e89c71cbba53b0c72e0105d0fef32f8061; a4cfce030e82b3432d16c9502185f58fd6a932df; 4c9fe8c42dd952b0a09567aac6250449a48293e1; 3dd239d078852c9f6da9160675430629d203e569; 9d937691a70d490b828027259ba9d9967dc7f5f7; 63f75305af9f066c0995009766f26e68972e3ecd; 0d1fe57595b33fee47ed8b06fbe859bd62835d6b; 59de6abccd8e767ef79343502d133207a54d3346; 129791a878c0f30edda0169e112379a8e5a9b180; 193db94727745a0ffea5ac48b41cbba9d6832ec0; 124c8ea22df8cd8fd9d5bfc42ff155026b77350f; b134cce23c8862b9454b09eb79770f7ce796a3df,BMC Cancer,16,

We investigated the impact of mechanical unloading with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) on the myocardial proteome.


METHODS
We collected 11 patient-matched samples of myocardial left ventricular tissue of patients with non-ischaemic dilate cardiomyopathy, harvested at time of LVAD implant ('pre-LVAD') and heart transplant ('post-LVAD'). Samples were studied by quantitative proteomics. Further we performed histological assessment of deposited collagens and immune infiltration in both pre- and post-LVAD samples.


RESULTS
A core set of â€‰>1700 proteins was identified and quantified at a false discovery rate â€‰<1%. The previously established decrease post-LVAD of alpha-1-antichymotrypsin was corroborated. We noted a post-LVAD decrease of matricellular proteins and proteoglycans such as periostin and versican. Also, proteins of the complement system and precursors of cardiac peptide hormones were decreased post-LVAD. An increase post-LVAD was evident for individual proteins linked to the innate immune response, proteins involved in diverse metabolic pathways, and proteins involved in protein synthesis. Histological analysis did not reveal significant alterations post-LVAD of deposited collagens or immune infiltration. The proteomic data further highlighted a pronounced inter-patient heterogeneity with regards to the impact of LVAD therapy on the left ventricular myocardial proteome. Finally, the proteomic data showed differential proteolytic processing in response to LVAD therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings underline a strong impact of LVAD therapy on the left ventricular myocardial proteome. Together with previous studies, protein markers of LVAD therapy such as alpha-1-antichymotrypsin are becoming apparent. Further, matricellular proteins are emerging as important components in response to LVAD therapy.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jasmin Hasmik Shahinian"", ids = ""3652253""); list(name = ""Bettina Mayer"", ids = ""2948600""); list(name = ""Stefan Tholen"", ids = ""145287846""); list(name = ""Kerstin Brehm"", ids = ""46727566""); list(name = ""Martin L.

We have selected 30 unrelated controls (16 males, 14 females; age=59.8Â±10.4) and 37 male methamphetamine abusers (age=43.3Â±7.8). We analyzed 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 7 neuronal genes in chromosome 18q21 for DNA samples that was checked for the data quality and genotype error. The association between the case-control status and each individual SNP was measured using multiple logistic regression models (adjusting for age and sex as covariates). And we controlled false discovery rate (FDR) to deal with multiple testing problem.


RESULTS
We found 3 significant SNPs of 2 genes in chromosome 18q21 (p-value<0.05; adjusting for age as covariate) in methamphetamine abusers compared to controls. We also found 2 significant SNPs of 1 gene (p-value<0.05; adjusting for age and sex as covariates) (rs3794899, rs3794901:MAPK4). Two SNPs in MAPK4 gene were significant in both statistical groups.


CONCLUSION
MAPK4, the gene for mitogen-activated protein kinase 4, is one of the final 6 candidate genes including ME2 in 18q12-21 in our previous finemapping for psychosis. Our results suggest that MAPK4 can be a candidate gene that contribute to the methamphetamine addiction leading to psychosis.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Byung Dae Lee"", ids = ""4588281""); list(name = ""Je Min Park"", ids = ""21338571""); list(name = ""Young Min Lee"", ids = ""31554173""); list(name = ""Eun Soo Moon"", ids = ""4072146""); list(name = ""Hee Jeong Jeong"", ids = ""31851340""); list(name = ""Young In Chung"", ids = ""32169646""); list(name = ""Hyo Deog Rim"", ids = ""5637886"")",d5023611889de5ca36ebcbc3e4d3828342d92c3b; c8fc28097012d25f37711367dc3dd84a301b83ad,a09da340aabce32da39d3bb54ffb5279e09487e7; 31c72291d4afe7c4c92334388c5c2a6653c813e1; 1f369a5fbbfe97a11e810511d9ecdf2e23ff3369; 4fb0d71aea0d9a25628eb8e06b1cf00c56aab2ff; 418115c73b452905a46196db62225b393675325f; e63309368db0cebf2dd2c60ac7f81f1cd90e5bf4; 2c4a06641330dcbcb8069d644807e772d934e010; 0834a7e89a8c9093efd0d02472fea613f5059e21; 196d53d446cff872c8e93690455b297fa86a48e6; 1729917846b9f570adf39511c241a12d5375e61e; 0e004dbb9ff9fd3e15aac56812e2d019388818d0; c2907e3bf9194767f97742f961d3983f281143f0; 50b5a50ea0f0b363e862d8dbde5f834ed9288ae0; fae30f4e16ad84dc73036da67ab3808b79166fcf; 18adcc156ced4cc230d940b61554b9247b567d2a; c5b96402c4af44be137e9df09da6a0dd5fc5cd3b; d18720335b6a6fdbd554e08675323cbba4216dff; 47239296e2f278c75ff39ce315f5babb00b64fc1; 5f08f251f3eff82b0fcb157088581abe762e29bc; a059425d99f55370e81e6ea86e544ca79174aa2e; a67d9cccde8a4eb80a0ab301f67bd9abd478069c; 4a44d2fa6f1444884851ece5784f97e7b042a827; 85fb838044422897f29340966c558762f1e71e58; 03947d2c6464ffd604b184faaf74e57454bcefea; 119a19e659ed320cc3d3de5f3f307ff456a6c3ff; 2052310c7b7488a1f76d7b5abb8c44d63c1f3a1c; 98905e2d9f85aeb48a86dc0e78d5e3c89b7950ff; 06ed20e39914c802547be1d3547f30399eb60f02; 3a11f14b219a92cf27fd07eb779771da08cb9052; 720e15e360b12e4d46512e0185615f79f7954e8a; 654889bdf33512fae45849b4c76d5a3153ea6033; 49ca8af16da70236c4c0e276f24898df37eef139; 46a221edafb9392189f08fad222317651a2a5abd; 6b2f5b74013dff1cfa0d58181b8519cc927fe021; c95198b8b8f1b77f6b3dd76b01a5d93386ec351d; 283770343910652d37bfe746536b8888d93a093c; c07233c36efffc27cf95bc1eb292b617a1821a78; b12808bbb5dd996f342c6d0e09a00e1d8fad4703; 8ea101c921d33ef00d11d9f4a1044046c07c1370; ec3eddd64dec4dda182b0a9708eb820d37aca349; 2ed2632971630a65f308121d712f30ff6173bf3f; 039ff98c9bfb83cee7d659fd6d742293bcdaa8ab; 825a6ace1c3b5fe209b5df73537a996b881bb517; 5a6fd7b6a2c9561a12854694efe6af39a9cb38c4; 2b2b9293926052c4246efa91a69c66b92b19656b; 32f26fb1193511f1b41e6c274b797daffaffa2bb; 0d7c34957a70821592fee1a6c8c92ac21a3c7747; ddfd0a93d1288ce3cf0229165e0089dec1ac0dd0; aaead883365539ef4ce3fa6f31d08c67730b35bc; 2494294303492cc662a2c30def642c4826a98107; 90986e00e80fc0fd5b3af238765b5fe67d7be895; 250f91052b161a8e8bf6a8a5064ff6a286a72479; ebe6a50540999fd27e360ceb5f5dcaa7aa7056ff; 25f08d7a75cee7bd04fcbb1eb96813045909ce51; dd4565570182a7527f11a9f95e638e800b696d76; be16dfd7837264473ab409cbc99333e5e0737664; f03ef17c89e47c9b6538067f2088e3b35e438218; 7595b759adc899cd396738f22a9ee0e6cb2d64ea; f3e759f35be9f56ed92c021bcdb255b9133c4a0b; 9d06be76e0efe47b54601942fa6980064b3b229f; d274b4adb4344d33840a7f89c21f5a0a312c2d89; 159c4b9ea47d0cb36ff4beddfb50d1df724226cc; bd1912d8af7b6c6b24dfaf60d8fb8dfe0a40759f,Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience,12,54 - 64

While this is well known, the downstream consequences of misalignment have not been fully characterized. Â We assessed the potential for incorrect alignment of RNA-sequencing reads to cause false positives in both gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and co-expression analyses. Trans-eQTLs identified from human RNA-sequencing studies appeared to be particularly affected by this phenomenon, even when only uniquely aligned reads are considered. Over 75% of trans-eQTLs using a standard pipeline occurred between regions of sequence similarity and therefore could be due to alignment errors. Further, associations due to mapping errors are likely to misleadingly replicate between studies. To help address this problem, we quantified the potential for ""cross-mapping'' to occur between every pair of annotated genes in the human genome. Such cross-mapping data can be used to filter or flag potential false positives in both trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses. Such filtering substantially alters the detection of significant associations and can have an impact on the assessment of false discovery rate, functional enrichment, and replication for RNA-sequencing association studies.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ashis Saha"", ids = ""47162528""); list(name = ""Alexis Battle"", ids = ""145086335"")",,,F1000Research,7,
b7ec962f99376aee60ae0d117dd101d08a73af16,Efficient and accurate bioinformatics algorithms for peptide mass spectrometry,"Peptide tandem mass spectrometry has emerged as a key technology to detect and measure proteins in biological systems. A core problem is the interpretation of tandem mass spectra. These spectrum annotations are then used to study post-translational modifications, disease biomarkers, protein-protein interactions, and subcellular localization. Technological breakthroughs have led to the generation of ever-increasing volumes of data. Experiments generating tens of millions of spectra are routine, and require efficient algorithms to be effectively analyzed. Filters using sequence tags, as implemented in the InsPecT software toolkit, allow spectra to be rapidly searched against a large proteomics database. The MS-Alignment algorithm addresses the still more challenging problem of interpreting mass spectra in the presence of unanticipated modifications. A key consideration is the efficient handling of large data volumes without the need for manual intervention. In any high-throughput biological experiment, calculation of a false discovery rate is essential. The use of a decoy database of shuffled proteins is emerging as a key method for measuring false discovery rates. In addition, decoy database allows a direct comparison of the quality of results from different search parameters, instrument settings, or software tools. We adopt a principled approach to correcting or filtering spurious annotations and experimental artifacts. A key idea is the focus on error rate, not at the level of individual spectra, but at the level of distinct peptides, or modification sites. Results at this higher level can be made more accurate by integrating data across mass spectra. Additional research is presented on the analysis of RNA microarrays. Here the goal is the identification of gene sets - such as members of a pathway - which are up- or down-regulated. Here the fundamental data is differential transcription levels, as measured by a t statistic. As with mass spectra, leveraging separate measurements (expression levels across many genes) improves accuracy. And computing the false positive rate in a principled way, with an appropriate null model, is vital for computing valid p-values",2007,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Stephen W.

39e5b40ac53d9cf7a090f4292831ed5c63f2f2da,Reduced evolutionary rates in HIV-1 reveal extensive latency periods among replicating lineages,"BackgroundHIV-1 can persist for the duration of a patient's life due in part to its ability to hide from the immune system, and from antiretroviral drugs, in long-lived latent reservoirs. Latent forms of HIV-1 may also be disproportionally involved in transmission. Thus, it is important to detect and quantify latency in the HIV-1 life cycle.ResultsWe developed a novel molecular clockâ€“based phylogenetic tool to investigate the prevalence of HIV-1 lineages that have experienced latency. The method removes alternative sources that may affect evolutionary rates, such as hypermutation, recombination, and selection, to reveal the contribution of generation-time effects caused by latency. Our method was able to recover latent lineages with high specificity and sensitivity, and low false discovery rates, even on relatively short branches on simulated phylogenies. Applying the tool to HIV-1 sequences from 26 patients, we show that the majority of phylogenetic lineages have been affected by generation-time effects in every patient type, whether untreated, elite controller, or under effective or failing treatment. Furthermore, we discovered extensive effects of latency in sequence data (gag, pol, and env) from reservoirs as well as in the replicating plasma population. To better understand our phylogenetic findings, we developed a dynamic model of virus-host interactions to investigate the proportion of lineages in the actively replicating population that have ever been latent. Assuming neutral evolution, our dynamic modeling showed that under most parameter conditions, it is possible for a few activated latent viruses to propagate so that in time, most HIV-1 lineages will have been latent at some time in their past.ConclusionsThese results suggest that cycling in and out of latency plays a major role in the evolution of HIV-1. Thus, no aspect of HIV-1 evolution can be fully understood without considering latency - including treatment, drug resistance, immune evasion, transmission, and pathogenesis.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Taina T.

8bd639b2578b37b8393a1087132acfd067ab939e,False Discovery Rate Based Sensor Decision Rules for the Network-Wide Distributed Detection Problem,"This paper presents a new framework for distributed target detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In distributed detection, quantized decisions from local sensors are transmitted to a sink (also known as the fusion center) which combines these decisions to come up with a global decision. Traditionally, while collaboratively detecting the presence or absence of a target in a sensor field, multiple networked sensors use identical decision rules for decision making. This decision rule is obtained by imposing a strict control on the probability of one or more local false alarms from the entire sensor network. This error rate is known as the family-wise error rate (FWER) in the statistical literature. In this paper, we propose the control of the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the ratio of the number of local false alarms to the total number of local detections, instead of the FWER, to determine possible nonidentical local sensor decision rules. Under the assumption that the fusion center uses a test statistic which is linear in ""count"" (i.e., the total number of local detections) to reach the global decision regarding the presence or absence of a target, we demonstrate that the control of the FDR to determine the local sensor decision rules, instead of employing identical decision rules, can substantially improve the global detection performance.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Priyadip Ray"", ids = ""48874255""); list(name = ""Pramod K.

0bfa4026866fe417bc46d7cfabf369a98dd9569d,Butyrate induces profound changes in gene expression related to multiple signal pathways in bovine kidney epithelial cells,"BackgroundGlobal gene expression profiles of bovine kidney epithelial cells regulated by sodium butyrate were investigated with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. The bovine microarray with 86,191 distinct 60mer oligonucleotides, each with 4 replicates, was designed and produced with Maskless Array Synthesizer technology. These oligonucleotides represent approximately 45,383 unique cattle sequences.Results450 genes significantly regulated by butyrate with a median False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0 % were identified. The majority of these genes were repressed by butyrate and associated with cell cycle control. The expression levels of 30 selected genes identified by the microarray were confirmed using real-time PCR. The results from real-time PCR positively correlated (R = 0.867) with the results from the microarray.ConclusionThis study presented the genes related to multiple signal pathways such as cell cycle control and apoptosis. The profound changes in gene expression elucidate the molecular basis for the pleiotropic effects of butyrate on biological processes. These findings enable better recognition of the full range of beneficial roles butyrate may play during cattle energy metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and possibly in fighting gastrointestinal pathogens.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Robert W.

Previously, we found significant RNA expression differences in circulating neutrophils between patients with unruptured IAs and aneurysm-free controls. Searching for circulating biomarkers for unruptured IAs, we tested the feasibility of developing classification algorithms that use neutrophil RNA expression levels from blood samples to predict the presence of an IA.MethodsNeutrophil RNA extracted from blood samples from 40 patients (20 with angiography-confirmed unruptured IA, 20 angiography-confirmed IA-free controls) was subjected to next-generation RNA sequencing to obtain neutrophil transcriptomes. In a randomly-selected training cohort of 30 of the 40 samples (15 with IA, 15 controls), we performed differential expression analysis. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05, fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰1.5) were used to construct prediction models for IA using four well-known supervised machine-learning approaches (diagonal linear discriminant analysis, cosineÂ nearest neighbors, nearest shrunken centroids, and support vector machines). These models were tested in a testing cohort of the remaining 10 neutrophil samples from the 40 patients (5 with IA, 5 controls), and model performance was assessed by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactionÂ (PCR) was used to corroborate expression differences of a subset of model transcripts in neutrophil samples from a new, separate validation cohort of 10 patients (5 withÂ IA, 5 controls).ResultsThe training cohort yielded 26 highly significantly differentially expressed neutrophil transcripts. Models using these transcripts identified IA patients in the testing cohort with accuracy ranging from 0.60 to 0.90. The best performing model was the diagonal linear discriminant analysis classifier (area under the ROC curveâ€‰=â€‰0.80 and accuracyâ€‰=â€‰0.90). Six of seven differentially expressed genes we tested were confirmed by quantitative PCR using isolated neutrophils from the separateÂ validation cohort.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the potential of machine-learning methods to classify IA cases and create predictive models for unruptured IAs using circulating neutrophil transcriptome data.

c1c6c6e935804bd27f65d4b7fab03719a046c439,Fast Saddle-Point Algorithm for Generalized Dantzig Selector and FDR Control with Ordered L1-Norm,"In this paper we propose a primal-dual proximal extragradient algorithm to solve the generalized Dantzig selector (GDS) estimation problem, based on a new convex-concave saddle-point (SP) reformulation. Our new formulation makes it possible to adopt recent developments in saddle-point optimization, to achieve the optimal $O(1/k)$ rate of convergence. Compared to the optimal non-SP algorithms, ours do not require specification of sensitive parameters that affect algorithm performance or solution quality. We also provide a new analysis showing a possibility of local acceleration to achieve the rate of $O(1/k^2)$ in special cases even without strong convexity or strong smoothness. As an application, we propose a GDS equipped with the ordered $\ell_1$-norm, showing its false discovery rate control properties in variable selection. Algorithm performance is compared between ours and other alternatives, including the linearized ADMM, Nesterov's smoothing, Nemirovski's mirror-prox, and the accelerated hybrid proximal extragradient techniques.",2016,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sangkyun Lee"", ids = ""39525147""); list(name = ""Damian Brzyski"", ids = ""3434542""); list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""34616072"")",2197c9379f47f8fb36eb1686ca82211a8c8d5b6c; 331f9a90ec4571653b009d20d2ff58aee96f8ff3; 058d7a1b6be563754308c8724860843e2908de81; de5eef1388c798ad80e2646aaf5de76ab7ddd514,0fc239fdc9024c602f006a5d14de1841842a209d; 8e6c6086ea725737aa6081a57ea68d43a24ca3b9; 751529c0399bd58ba7a2fbd40c7b80ffd56b0c66; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; b1dc0fa0edd9ccf77f6a3df48833f6e48fc40068; 782f612fe53a7ad366743a213de7c29d6a0b4536; 52c89453c3b0aed94e0c8d4343a83d19d1c1b3a9; 275d19ac15a448706c4d1dca4f15fc6ee6c0c3ba; 04436d8bcc47cc4750a44505ec53297d88f3f86b; cdfcac1e3291b10424b5858ac0ecc9daf702efc4; 5f0387363e3c722407308c076d5324bf6b7b00f7; 75359c49a6abdd5fba642f46ec44812ed8e8a648; 67e9b53e762ea737d44930c7a14485a5945429c8; d6c9a670a7f63f223ef3ddc38744c64320a70623; 2e6a19158ba2c695494edbca0cd9ccabace0f03d; 8d3a318b62d2e970122da35b2a2e70a5d12cc16f; 1775719a073b2f510ba5454a69f04aa6051fbff0; 0f5aaa2513a0dfaf6020770416af7dff736245d3; 0b4051eca6d27f974f311909a785c3a995b81b57; 896eee52eef170e5f5a3bf880f85f737cba1cc3b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fdc8d9e386b5e6d2487c01ebf5efe40463ee7852; 472e8257dca67af31539bc2bdc1479a4c43bca2f; 7669c8e2edb9409dec9911ff20a5ba2d53d48ac0; 8b7de9c70da8832f59f2b0c4d31895d87049319f; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 1d7ad0a7ae64bd8d78d09d03ca181e6e579bd6d8; 744ef2e5fd170fc3f0dbb18c3f8f60f2cd92e082; 3e3a9c6e3012d6dab455bc038a29a00673cfb9e8; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 98a09ef8f128b01e4f3a4737b0beb5ec9b669295; 64233cfc7d8f61d966d02c74bed07d780b4337ac,,,780-789

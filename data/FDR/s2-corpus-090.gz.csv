Resistant cultivars are the preferred method of controlling cyst nematodes. Association mapping is a powerful approach to detect associations between phenotypic variation and genetic polymorphisms; in this way favorable traits such as resistance to pathogens can be located. Therefore, a genome-wide association study of 161 winter wheat accessions was performed with a 90K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Population structure analysis grouped into two major subgroups and first principal component accounted 6.16% for phenotypic diversity. The genome-wide linkage disequilibrium across wheat was 3 cM. Eleven quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on chromosomes 1AL, 2AS, 2BL, 3AL, 3BL, 4AS, 4AL, 5BL, and 7BL were identified using a mixed linear model false discovery rate of P < 0.01 that explained 43% of total genetic variation. This is the first report of QTLs conferring resistance to H. filipjevi in wheat. Eight QTLs on chromosomes 1AL, 2AS, 2BL, 3AL, 4AL, and 5BL were linked to putative genes known to be involved in plant-pathogen interactions. Two other QTLs on 3BL and one QTL on 7BL linked to putative genes known to be involved in abiotic stress.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shree R.

46d2602bc501fc6d43826a0b542d905b1d998359,Thermal evolution of gene expression profiles in Drosophila subobscura,"BackgroundDespite its pervasiveness, the genetic basis of adaptation resulting in variation directly or indirectly related to temperature (climatic) gradients is poorly understood. By using 3-fold replicated laboratory thermal stocks covering much of the physiologically tolerable temperature range for the temperate (i.e., cold tolerant) species Drosophila subobscura we have assessed whole-genome transcriptional responses after three years of thermal adaptation, when the populations had already diverged for inversion frequencies, pre-adult life history components, and morphological traits. Total mRNA from each population was compared to a reference pool mRNA in a standard, highly replicated two-colour competitive hybridization experiment using cDNA microarrays.ResultsA total of 306 (6.6%) cDNA clones were identified as 'differentially expressed' (following a false discovery rate correction) after contrasting the two furthest apart thermal selection regimes (i.e., 13Â°C vs . 22Â°C), also including four previously reported candidate genes for thermotolerance in Drosophila (Hsp26, Hsp68, Fst, and Treh). On the other hand, correlated patterns of gene expression were similar in cold- and warm-adapted populations. Analysis of functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology project point to an overrepresentation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acids metabolism and regulation of transcription among other categories. Although the location of differently expressed genes was approximately at random with respect to chromosomes, a physical mapping of 88 probes to the polytene chromosomes of D. subobscura has shown that a larger than expected number mapped inside inverted chromosomal segments.ConclusionOur data suggest that a sizeable number of genes appear to be involved in thermal adaptation in Drosophila, with a substantial fraction implicated in metabolism. This apparently illustrates the formidable challenge to understanding the adaptive evolution of complex trait variation. Furthermore, some clustering of genes within inverted chromosomal sections was detected. Disentangling the effects of inversions will be obviously required in any future approach if we want to identify the relevant candidate genes.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hafid Laayouni"", ids = ""2815163""); list(name = ""F.

c3481b6f497d53871a47afa2477d796de3b91130,Detecting mutations in mixed sample sequencing data using empirical Bayes,"We develop statistically based methods to detect single nucleotide DNA mutations in next generation sequencing data. Sequencing generates counts of the number of times each base was observed at hundreds of thousands to billions of genome positions in each sample. Using these counts to detect mutations is challenging because mutations may have very low prevalence and sequencing error rates vary dramatically by genome position. The discreteness of sequencing data also creates a difficult multiple testing problem: current false discovery rate methods are designed for continuous data, and work poorly, if at all, on discrete data. We show that a simple randomization technique lets us use continuous false discovery rate methods on discrete data. Our approach is a useful way to estimate false discovery rates for any collection of discrete test statistics, and is hence not limited to sequencing data. We then use an empirical Bayes model to capture different sources of variation in sequencing error rates.

82380f0a0ba5242a34317d13e3da122b7ffd0e2e,Multiple Testing of Hypotheses in Biomedical Research,Abstract Multiple Comparisons are standard staple when testing in the environment of Analysis of Variance. The number of experimental conditions or populations is usually small. The assumptions that are needed to be fulfilled for the validity of Analysis of Variance are normally met. Biomedical research is branching away to encompass more complex phenomena. The Genome Wide Association Studies involve a complex disease and thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms waiting to be explored for a possible association with the disease. Identifying those single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the disease under focus falls into the realm of multiple testing. Special methods are needed to test thousands of null hypotheses at the same time using data that is correlated across the spectrum of hypotheses. What constitutes a Type I error is an issue. There is no clear understanding what Type II error is. The purpose of this article is to lay out in a systematic fashion basic ideas in multiple testing primarily addressed to biomedical researchers. Parametric and nonparametric procedures in multiple testing are discussed. Several definitions of Type I error are presented and their merits and demerits outlined. The Family Wise Error Rate and False Discovery Rate are discussed at length. A number of multiple testing procedures are presented. A number of examples are presented to highlight the concepts and applications.,2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Hansen Bannerman-Thompson"", ids = ""1403843181""); list(name = ""M.

093dab24fff33cea8a5741c6bbd831dc9fa3ebcf,Title : Integrated in vivo multi-omics identifies p 21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The molecular mechanisms underlying IBD are poorly characterized and treatment options are limited. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multi-omic analysis that integrates RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phospho-protein MS (pMS) measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of data from individual samples, we were able to track information flow from RNA to protein to phospho-protein to identify species that were coordinately or discordantly regulated. We used this information in two ways. First, we identified pathways that demonstrate complex in vivo regulation. For example, the genes encoding acute phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected via MS in colons during inflammation. Second, we used the multi-dimensional dataset to ascertain which facets of chronic inflammation are described by each type of data. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omic co-expression network analysis, we found that each data set provides a unique viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Nevertheless, all of the mouse data sets, as well as human transcriptomic data, implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis and chemical inhibition of Pak1/2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide a comprehensive view of the state of signaling in the context of colitis and identify Pak as a therapeutic target in IBD. [Main Text:] Introduction Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), composed of Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), affects more than 5 million people worldwide. Sufferers experience a variety of debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms that require medical and, eventually, surgical intervention. The ultimate target of medical treatment is mucosal healing, which has been demonstrated to lead to improved outcomes. However, this goal remains elusive in many patients. While there have been recent advances in therapeutics, the current treatment options for IBD are limited and include general immunomodulators and targeted antibody-based biologics such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), anti-a4b7 integrin, and anti-IL-12/23 (1). All of these therapies suffer from variable efficacy and non-durable response, as well as significant side effect profiles. A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBD would lead to new therapeutic strategies that could lead to more effective treatments. Genetic and epidemiological studies in human patients (2, 3), as well as experimental studies in animal models (4), have identified numerous genetic and environmental risk factors for CD and UC, but have not identified clear driver mutations that lead to therapeutic opportunities. In order to account for the complexity in IBD etiology, researchers have taken transcriptomic (5, 6), proteomic (7, 8), metabolomic (9, 10) and metagenomic (11, 12) approaches in an attempt to understand global disease networks and to identify novel differentially expressed genes, proteins, and metabolites that may be involved in disease pathogenesis. While these approaches have provided valuable insight, they have fallen short of identifying potential high value therapeutic targets in IBD. In this study, we have generated a unique multi-omic dataset in which transcriptomic, proteomic, and phospho-proteomic measurements were made from individual colons of mice with and without colitis. We have used this dataset to understand the relationships between RNA expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation and to determine what each measurement reveals about gut inflammation. Since all three types of data were collected from each individual sample, we were able to identify discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic measurements, allowing us to predict post-translational protein regulation and to identify expression changes originating at distant organ sites. Finally, we performed coexpression network analysis to identify signaling pathways that were coordinately or uniquely dysregulated in the different data sets and we computationally inferred kinase activation from global pMS data through collation of kinase substrate lists inputted in the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm. These complementary computational approaches implicated Pak signaling as a potential driver of colitis, which we validating by performing a preclinical therapeutic study in mice. Altogether, these studies provide an unprecedented view of dysregulated signaling in colitis and identify a previously unrecognized pathogenic signaling pathway that represents a viable therapeutic opportunity. Results Collection of multi-omic data from mouse colon The initial goal of this study was to quantify global transcriptomic and proteomic changes that occur during chronic colitis. Because this requires a large amount of starting material, we chose to use a mouse model of IBD, namely the adoptive transfer mouse model of CD, known for high penetrance and relatively short latency (13). Rag1 null animals on a C57BL/6J genetic background were injected with 400,000 CD45RBhi naÃ¯ve T cells or, as a negative control, 200,000 regulatory T cells (Tregs) from isogenic wild-type (WT) animals and then weighed biweekly and assessed for symptoms related to the onset of colitis, such as diarrhea and rectal prolapse. Animals were sacrificed following sustained weight loss of greater than 1.5 grams for one week, which we found to be indicative of severe colitis. Control animals were sacrificed concomitantly. Upon sacrifice, 3mm of tissue from the medial colon was removed and fixed for histological assessment (fig. S1). The remaining colon was opened longitudinally and approximately 1/8th was snap frozen for microarray analysis, while the remaining matched tissue was snap frozen for mass spectrometry (fig. S2). This tissue processing strategy allowed us to collect RNA, total protein, and phospho-protein from an individual colon, and then to perform relative quantification among control and experimental animals. Following sample processing and data collection, we quantified 39,325 named (38,666 unique) RNA transcripts, 8,131 proteins (7,951 unique proteins), and 3,159 phospho-peptides representing 3,325 unique phosphorylation sites on 1,711 proteins (tables S1-S3). Our initial analysis indicated that each of the three measurements segregated the inflamed mice from the non-inflamed via unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1A). Of the 7,951 proteins measured by total MS, 7,611 (96%) were represented in the microarray data set. RNA transcripts were measured for 1,634 (95%) of the 1,711 proteins in the pMS data set. Total protein MS data was obtained for 1,474 (86%) of the 1,711 proteins measured by pMS and 1,415 species were measured in all three data sets. Because we measured RNA, protein, and phospho-protein from individual samples, we were able to perform one-to-one matched correlation of individual genes across measurements (Fig. 1B). The smoothed probability density functions for Spearman correlations showed a correlation landscape for RNA/MS comparison that was distinct from RNA/pMS and MS/pMS. Most RNA/MS gene pairs were positively correlated with each other with only a few species showing inverse correlation (Fig. 1B). The RNA/pMS probability density function showed a relatively flat, slightly bimodal, distribution indicating that there were similarly sized sub-groups of RNA molecules for which there was positive correlation, no correlation, or negative correlation between RNA abundance and phospho-peptide abundance. There were two peaks of weakly positive and weakly negative correlation between matched RNA/pMS species. Overall, the shape of the RNA/pMS distribution indicated that there were more species for which there was no correlation between RNA and pMS than positive correlation and that the group of inverse correlation between RNA and pMS was the smallest. The MS/pMS probability distribution was similar to the RNA/pMS distribution, but there were more positively correlated MS to phospho-peptide species than RNA/pMS species. There were also fewer MS to pMS species with no correlation between total protein and phospho-peptide abundance (Fig. 1B). We reasoned that the inverse correlation between some MS/pMS species might suggest proteins whose stability is post-translationally regulated, with phosphorylation marking the protein for degradation. Eplin (encoded by the Lima1 gene), which has a known ubiquitin-priming phosphorylation site, provides an example of this type of regulation. Lima1 transcript levels were essentially unchanged (1.1-fold down-regulated) in inflamed versus noninflamed tissue, yet the protein level was nearly two-fold decreased (Fig. 1C). At the same time there was a 3.3-fold induction in phosphorylation at Ser360 (Fig. 1C and D), which targets the protein for ubiquitination and degradation (14). Differential expression analysis To identify the RNAs, proteins, and phospho-peptides that were differentially expressed in inflamed colons, we used the Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney (WMW) test with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH FDR) correction (WMW p<0.05, BH FDR q<0.25). Overall, 7,752 of 38,666 RNA transcripts, 4,443 of 7,951 proteins, and 2,346 of 3,325 phospho-peptides were differentially expressed (table S4). Of the 7,611 overlapping RNAs and proteins, 1,858 were similarly differentially expressed, while 1,064 RNAs and 2,401 proteins were differentially expressed in only one data set (Fig. 1E). All of the 1,474 proteins measured by both pMS and MS were differentially expressed at either the total protein or phospho-peptide level or both (Fig. 1E). Finally, none of the 1,634 RNAs with co-measured phospho-peptides were differentially expr",2018,,"list(name = ""Jesse Lyonsa"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Douglas K.

Multiple differential expression networks (DENs) were constructed based on the microarray profiles across different aging groups (<70 years, 70-80 years, and >80 years). Next, a module-based approach was utilized to extract the common candidate modules across all age groups. We used Module Connectivity Dynamic Score (MCDS) to quantify the connectivity change of the common modules among the different age groups. Functional analyses were implemented for the genes in the common modules to further identify the significant biological processes. A total of two DENs were constructed. Overall 657 informative genes were screened out. When false discovery rate (FDR) was set as 0.05, we found that 148 modules were significant. Only 1 significant 2-differential modules (DMs) (module 493) with dynamic changes was discovered. Significantly, the genes in the module 493 participated in 7 significant pathways, including pentose phosphate pathway, carbon metabolism, and citrate cycle (TCA cycle). In conclusion, pathway functions [pentose phosphate pathway, carbon metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), chromosomal instability, ateroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and immune response] may serve as potential therapeutic targets in aging.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gang Li"", ids = ""145330418""); list(name = ""Ke-Yu Liu"", ids = ""89208120""); list(name = ""Zhong-Peng Qiu"", ids = ""90568125"")",,e15a4509f1c770d2a7f180926a0bc85fe0af67cb; a9274483ca9d6a3cde1433d30708bbfde584760a; 7027dd70e58eeea28d36451cd2818804d8b7af18; 0559c6b1c93c738803d5d47227dc66cb857d1085; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ff7facc64bed709baa46f13c460b325cce8c57bf; 7d5efeffec5fc2bf519f2b80d6215eeae8486d53; e8979f16fd203e2da6b0b4ab00099b85b2df9b18; 79bd78ac1c93470848aa50f49f86196c0ec4cb80; 10dda5c7430efd451f08694e56c16e4208edd82b; aaa1ee7820cdf958822f37a47abcf068e54cc6a2; 57b7e6793406bbeab5b78a086fb12455ad9e5788; 1eeba4041648c0151b1e7bd7f9715a6d12441d1c; 8bfefa9d794195b29bddb1473d2e85f3c3f041e8; cf1e723003973e2cdf7b9aefed8d4bfa5a6d0a18; 008ea6c716cd99e4eb917797d652c141b209a243; 418e9dcb003277cee4d00291c12856afd1453eea; 3a40eebf032fd4bf3a23e21fdc5ffa66f060ed4e; 9107369ea53e3d453a18cc19d1430e0c69987c13; f1328fde91f6d03cafed30d30906a1fb4d2509e5; 8ae9640947dfbe23cfadbe9752895c93a0ea3399; 96cdd2e9cc5e55f94ada44b76a4e4d3a1fea59d8; 4118a57cc8da95127f2f2a401542716d23406902; 38897feb5c27c380f20dc530bebfd62db6055e39; c1a8b4ae2ee44d2224f72a29d744827056f1c9ad; da7865ab3a237c8c3264d8be3bd4cf796937c777; 3ed436b2b92d50a4af31015774472101652eb983; 12cc9dbd45fd0368c841f7c5430f55afb5029f6d; bfe284a74c279931ee06be9c6caccf40e0bfba9c; 5fdda5bc60c653cc10f28a49e6e9aa206aa22304; cea06a93614908fce01b2951241f94ce4a67aae8; 77a3dba55445f5fe05ca8159c8721436dcd7b598; c2d16997ab2cc6dd88aa19a6810b1111481a8dd1,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,17,3411 - 3416
a862402b42d7037e089e374c2c963e0db7b9c903,Computer Intensive Sampling Methods in Ecology,"Here, we focus on alternative significance tests for ecological data that often have skewed distributions, which impair the use of most parametric significance tests based on the normal distribution. Randomization tests have been proposed as an alternative to those classical significance tests where the observed data are repetitively reshuffled to generate a reference distribution that is then used to assess the significance of the statistic under study. Ecological data are also often correlated due to temporal autocorrelation, spatial autocorrelation, or phylogenetic structure, thereby violating assumptions of data independence of many randomization tests. In such circumstances, restricted randomization should be used. Alternatives to randomization tests such as bootstrap and jackknife are presented. Finally, we address the issue of multiple tests and show how the false discovery rate is more appropriate than Bonferroni correction and sequential methods.

In this work, we introduce a new method for controlling the FDR in meta-analysis of many decentralized linear models. Our method targets the scenario where many research groups---possibly the number of which is random---are independently testing a common set of hypotheses and then sending summary statistics to a coordinating center in an online manner. Built on the knockoffs framework introduced by Barber and Candes (2015), our procedure starts by applying the knockoff filter to each linear model and then aggregates the summary statistics via one-shot communication in a novel way. This method gives exact FDR control non-asymptotically without any knowledge of the noise variances or making any assumption about sparsity of the signal. In certain settings, it has a communication complexity that is optimal up to a logarithmic factor.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Weijie J.

a329379e5dab0220cd218f8ac398a7dd1f7eb15e,compound.Cox: Univariate feature selection and compound covariate for predicting survival,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
Univariate feature selection is one of the simplest and most commonly used techniques to develop a multigene predictor for survival. Presently, there is no software tailored to perform univariate feature selection and predictor construction.


METHODS
We develop the compound.Cox R package that implements univariate significance tests (via the Wald tests or score tests) for feature selection. We provide a cross-validation algorithm to measure predictive capability of selected genes and a permutation algorithm to assess the false discovery rate. We also provide three algorithms for constructing a multigene predictor (compound covariate, compound shrinkage, and copula-based methods), which are tailored to the subset of genes obtained from univariate feature selection. We demonstrate our package using survival data on the lung cancer patients. We examine the predictive capability of the developed algorithms by the lung cancer data and simulated data.


RESULTS
The developed R package, compound.Cox, is available on the CRAN repository. The statistical tools in compound.Cox allow researchers to determine an optimal significance level of the tests, thus providing researchers an optimal subset of genes for prediction. The package also allows researchers to compute the false discovery rate and various prediction algorithms.",2019,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Takeshi Emura"", ids = ""1808764""); list(name = ""Shigeyuki Matsui"", ids = ""1687379""); list(name = ""Hsuan-Yu Chen"", ids = ""2610243"")",ad096c6ba921a106f14b473512b739ee4a878fc9,c4b68c32d951ca30c2cd084218a921507d86fe3b; 0d73960ee68254c0c429d8f030b8bc808d4edb11; 119b1322d8d64b1339fbc8ca6b505a408412b560; e9e4beef4d5d506dfad6fd519cca0c1ce4d9e2dd; 8b365c5e729d4199ca366b8a5d6e2072de7cac3d; bf13ec0f484e87fe24f64dc294d5c900cbc6ee53; 13bae0189ceed3604252aa9e14951fb4feb960f9; 62b9f2aa45be15ba72bbb441bd7c36f70be6249e; 11c188c56917dc1542802062f3623bb60df9b48d; db8bbab1d0972c1882a08c291e534e457069da05; 4c5d6d3e3c721e7eb8cab0bfbf684cf575b0b8e2; 9d37cd9fe1728d69e37fdccac8374a81edb1e8b0; e1953b9d1e847b3ee6d958eaa67bfbf43b16cfe3; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,168,"

386af429571e5e4c8e36c52b1b241848c5338094,RNA-Sequencing Highlights Inflammation and Impaired Integrity of the Vascular Wall in Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Background and Purpose- Interventional treatment of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) has become increasingly controversial. Because medical therapy is still lacking, we aimed to obtain insight into the disease mechanisms implicated in BAVMs and to identify potential targets for medical treatment to prevent rupture of a BAVM. Methods- We used next-generation RNA sequencing to identify differential expression on a transcriptome-wide level comparing tissue samples of 12 BAVMs to 16 intracranial control arteries. We identified differentially expressed genes by negative binominal generalized log-linear regression (false discovery rate corrected P<0.05). We selected 10 genes for validation using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. We performed functional pathway analysis accounting for potential gene-length bias, to establish enhancement of biological pathways involved in BAVMs. We further assessed which Gene Ontology terms were enriched. Results- We found 736 upregulated genes in BAVMs including genes implicated in the cytoskeletal machinery and cell-migration and genes encoding for inflammatory cytokines and secretory products of neutrophils and macrophages. Furthermore, we found 498 genes downregulated including genes implicated in extracellular matrix composition, the binary angiopoietin-TIE system, and TGF (transforming growth factor)-Î² signaling. We confirmed the differential expression of top 10 ranked genes. Functional pathway analysis showed enrichment of the protein digestion and absorption pathway (false discovery rate-adjusted P=1.70Ã—10-2). We identified 47 enriched Gene Ontology terms (false discovery rate-adjusted P<0.05) implicated in cytoskeleton network, cell-migration, endoplasmic reticulum, transmembrane transport, and extracellular matrix composition. Conclusions- Our genome-wide RNA-sequencing study points to involvement of inflammatory mediators, loss of cerebrovascular quiescence, and impaired integrity of the vascular wall in the pathophysiology of BAVMs. Our study may lend support to potential receptivity of BAVMs to medical therapeutics, including those promoting vessel maturation, and anti-inflammatory and immune-modifying drugs.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Allard J.

We defined a set of 54 944 human lincRNAs by drawing on four publicly available lincRNA datasets, and annotated âˆ¼2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from each of 15 cardiometabolic genome-wide association study datasets into these lincRNAs. We identified hundreds of lincRNAs with at least one trait-associated SNP: 898 SNPs in 343 unique lincRNAs at 5% false discovery rate, and 469 SNPs in 146 unique lincRNAs meeting Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05. An additional 64 trait-associated lincRNAs were identified using a class-level testing strategy at Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05. To better understand the genomic context and prioritize trait-associated lincRNAs, we examined the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between SNPs in the lincRNAs and SNPs that met genome-wide-significance in the region (Â±500 kb of lincRNAs). A subset of the lincRNA-trait association findings was replicated in independent Genome-wide association studies data from the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study study. For trait-associated lincRNAs, we also investigated synteny and conservation relative to mouse, expression patterns in five cardiometabolic-relevant tissues, and allele-specific expression in RNA sequencing data for adipose tissue and leukocytes. Finally, we revealed a functional role in human adipocytes for linc-NFE2L3-1, which is expressed in adipose and is associated with waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI. This comprehensive profile of trait-associated lincRNAs provides novel insights into disease mechanism and serves as a launching point for interrogation of the biology of specific lincRNAs in cardiometabolic disease.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel L Ballantyne"", ids = ""13690666""); list(name = ""Xuan Zhang"", ids = ""1698961""); list(name = ""Sara VerÃ³nica Guadalupe NÃºÃ±ez"", ids = ""49509535""); list(name = ""Chenyi Xue"", ids = ""2186803""); list(name = ""Wei Zhao"", ids = ""144876300""); list(name = ""Eric C.

In this prospective cohort study, serum samples obtained from patients at risk of AMI (nâ€¯=â€¯112) and non-risk controls (nâ€¯=â€¯89) were tested using high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with univariate analysis using a false discovery rate (FDR) of qâ€¯=â€¯0.05 were performed to discriminate metabolic profiles and to determine significantly different metabolites between healthy control and AMI risk groups.


RESULTS
PLS-DA significantly separated the AMI risk sera from control sera. The metabolites associated with amino acid biosynthesis, 2-oxocarboxylic acid, tryptophan, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were mainly elevated in patients at risk of AMI. Further validation and quantification by MS/MS showed that tryptophan, carnitine, L-homocysteine sulfinic acid (L-HCSA), and cysteic acid (CA) were upregulated, while L-cysteine and L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA) were downregulated, specifically among AMI risk sera. Additionally, these discriminant metabolic profiles were not related to hypertension, smoking or alcoholism.


CONCLUSION
In conclusion, detecting upregulated L-HCSA and CA along with carnitine among patients at risk for AMI could serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers for early AMI detection.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adnan Khan"", ids = ""144361369""); list(name = ""Yoonjeong Choi"", ids = ""47635155""); list(name = ""Joung Hwan Back"", ids = ""5315211""); list(name = ""Sunmi Lee"", ids = ""40176887""); list(name = ""Sun Ha Jee"", ids = ""2043510""); list(name = ""Youngja Hwang Park"", ids = ""46797022"")",,,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,,"

The goal of this study was to determine whether BMI is associated with gene methylation in breast tissue and to identify pathways that are commonly methylated in association with high BMI. Epigenome-wide methylation profiles were determined using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array in the non-diseased breast tissue of 81 women undergoing breast surgery between 2009 and 2013 at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. Multivariable, robust linear regression was performed to identify methylation sites associated with BMI at a false discovery rate q value <0.05. Gene expression microarray data was used to identify which of the BMI-associated methylation sites also showed correlation with gene expression. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to assess which pathways were enriched among the BMI-associated methylation sites. Of the 431,568 methylation sites analyzed, 2573 were associated with BMI (q value <0.05), 57Â % of which showed an inverse correlation with BMI. Pathways enriched among the 2573 probe sites included those involved in inflammation, insulin receptor signaling, and leptin signaling. We were able to mapÂ 1251 of the BMI-associated methylation sites to gene expression data, and, of these, 226 (18Â %) showed substantial correlations with gene expression. Our results suggest thatÂ BMI is associated with genome-wide methylation in non-diseased breast tissue and may influence epigenetic pathways involved in inflammatory and other carcinogenic processes.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brionna Y.

2ad366ab9e8d4ccb4df08198e1b7627069d759a0,Characterization of a naturally occurring breast cancer subset enriched in EMT and stem cell characteristics,"Metaplastic breast cancers (MBCs) are aggressive, chemoresistant tumors characterized by lineage plasticity. To advance understanding of their pathogenesis and relatedness to other breast cancer subtypes, twenty-eight MBCs were compared with common breast cancers using comparative genomic hybridization, transcriptional profiling, reverse phase protein arrays and by sequencing for common breast cancer mutations. MBCs demonstrated unique DNA copy number aberrations compared with common breast cancers. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 9/19 MBCs (47.4%) versus 80/232 hormone receptor-positive cancers (34.5%; p=0.32), 17/75 HER2-positive samples (22.7%; p=0.04), 20/240 basal-like cancers (8.3%; p<0.0001) and 0/14 claudin-low tumors (p=0.004). Of 7 PI3K/AKT pathway phosphorylation sites, six were more highly phosphorylated in MBCs than in other breast tumor subtypes. The majority of MBCs displayed mRNA profiles different from those of most common including basal-like cancers. By transcriptional profiling, MBCs and the recently identified claudin-low breast cancer subset constitute related receptor-negative subgroups characterized by low expression of GATA3-regulated genes and of genes responsible for cell-cell adhesion with enrichment for markers linked to stem cell function and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In contrast to other breast cancers, claudin-low tumors and most MBCs showed a significant similarity to a â€œtumorigenicâ€ signature defined using CD44+/CD24breast tumor-initiating stem cell-like cells. MBCs and claudin-low tumors are thus enriched in EMT and stem cell-like features, and may arise from an earlier, more chemoresistant breast epithelial precursor than basal-like or luminal cancers. PIK3CA mutations, EMT and stem cell-like characteristics likely contribute to the poor outcomes of MBC and suggest novel therapeutic targets. INTRODUCTION Metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBCs) are aggressive estrogen receptor (ERÎ±)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) tumors characterized by mesenchymal/sarcomatoid and/or squamous metaplasia of malignant breast epithelium (1-7). Because of limited understanding of their pathogenesis, MBCs are treated in the same fashion as basal-like or triple receptor-negative ductal cancers. However, while neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with high pathologic complete response rates in basal-like carcinomas, MBCs are usually chemoresistant (2). Transcriptional profiling has defined breast cancer subtypes (8,9). The origin of luminal A and B tumors appears to be the mammary duct luminal epithelium with concomitant hormone receptor expression. Elevated HER2 expression defines a subgroup with a poor prognosis; however, the responsiveness of this subgroup to trastuzumab improves outcomes (10). In contrast, basal-like cancers likely represent multiple different subtypes arising from distinct precursor cells from those of other cancers. Some basal-like breast cancers likely arise from mammary myoepithelial cells. To date, basal-like cancers have not presented specific therapy targets. As MBCs are triple-negative, they are distinct from luminal and HER2-amplified cancers. As they express some markers associated with basal-like cancers (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytokeratins 5/6), MBCs are proposed to represent a form of basal-like breast cancer. However, distinct clinical features such as chemoresistance suggest that MBCs may represent a unique subtype (2,3). We applied an integrated genomic-proteomic approach to determine mechanisms underlying metaplastic carcinogenesis and MBC chemoresistance along with the relatedness of MBCs to known breast cancer subtypes. Most MBCs showed a unique molecular profile and form a distinct subtype most closely related to a novel subset of receptor-negative breast cancers (claudin-low) characterized by loss of genes involved in cell-cell adhesion. An enrichment for stem cell-like and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MBCs (and claudin-low tumors) along with frequent genomic aberrations that activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway suggest reasons for MBC chemoresistance and that MBCs and claudin-low tumors may arise from more immature precursor cells than other breast cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Human tumors Twenty-eight frozen grade 3 MBCs with sarcomatoid (19) or squamous (9) metaplasia were obtained from the Breast Tumor Bank at M.D.Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and from a collaborator in Valencia (A.L.). The diagnosis was reconfirmed by pathologists at MDACC (M.G./S.K.) (2,3). Frozen tissue was used for DNA extraction (28 tumors) and, where adequate frozen tumor tissue remained, for RNA and protein extraction (16 MDACC tumors) (11). Three tumor cohorts were used for comparison to MBCs (Supplemental Figure 1). The first cohort, used for comparison of mutation frequency (547 tumors) and functional proteomic profiles (693), was composed of 693 frozen primary breast tumors obtained under IRB-approved protocols from MDACC. These tumors were subdivided into clinically-defined subtypes as described previously (Table 1) (12). A second cohort of 145 primary breast tumors was used for comparison to MBC gene copy number profiles herein (13,14). A third cohort (Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC)) of 184 breast tumors and 9 normal breast tissues was used for comparison with MBC transcriptional profiles (8,9,15). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients with tumors of different stages between the cohorts. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) CGH profiles from the 28 MBCs were generated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based GeneChipÂ® Human Mapping 50K Sty arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and compared to BACCGH profiles of primary breast tumors previously generated and processed (J.F.) at LBNL using HumArray1.14/HumArray2.0 (13,14,16-18). MBC 50K data are available. For comparison with LBNL tumors, the 28 MBC SNP chips were mapped to BAC resolution. This approach has been validated by comparing data derived using both platforms to analyze breast cancer cell lines (not shown). LBNL tumors were remapped to the May04 freeze from UCSC and regions around each BAC clone were defined as within a half distance to each neighboring clone or to the beginning or end of the i ftp://beamish.lbl.gov/njwang/ chromosome if telomeric. A median expression value was then obtained for SNPs in each BAC region. Missing values were assigned if <5 SNPs mapped to a particular region. Each array was recentered to have a median of 0. The resulting values were segmented using Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) followed by a merge-level procedure to combine segmented levels across the genome. Each missing value was assigned the value of its corresponding segment. Gain/loss events and fraction of genome altered were calculated. After this resolution reduction (median=18 SNPs/BAC;mean=30), the mean variability estimate was 0.25. Similar analyses beginning with the CBS steps were performed on the original dChip processed data. We used a Fisherâ€™s test to measure the difference in copy number at probes on each side of genes encoding PI3K/AKT pathway components. These p-values were used to fit a beta-uniform mixture (BUM) model to determine significance at a given false discovery rate (FDR). To directly compare the 50K SNP and older BAC platforms, DNA extracted from five MBCs was also run using the BAC platform. This confirmed a high concordance for the matched data derived from the two platforms (not shown). Detection of mutations DNA was extracted from 547 MDACC breast tumors along with 14 LCCC claudin-low breast tumors and 19 MBCs with sufficient remaining DNA for mutation detection (9,11,12). Following whole genome amplification, p53/PTEN genes were resequenced (19). CTNNB1 exon 3 (the most common site of mutations) was amplified from genomic DNA using a forward primer located at the 5' portion and a reverse primer at the 3' end of the exon. A tumor sample with a known CTNNB1 mutation was amplified and sequenced in parallel with tumor samples as a positive control. A SNP-based approach (Sequenom (San Diego, CA) MassArray) was used to detect mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS and E17K mutations in the AKT1/2/3 genes (12,20). This approach is unsuitable for detection of mutations that are not â€˜hot spotâ€™ mutations but is particularly suitable to mutation detection in breast cancer where stromal â€˜contaminationâ€™ is prevalent (21). Reverse phase protein lysate array (RPPA) RPPA was applied with the antibodies in Supplemental Table 1 to compare PI3K/AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation in protein lysates derived from 16 MBCs versus 693 common breast cancers (Supplemental Table 2) (2225). The expression of each antibody in a sample was corrected for protein loading using the average expression levels of all probed proteins. Transcriptional profiling Total RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction (Trizol, GIBCO/BRL), and mRNA was purified by either magnetic separation using Dynabeads (Dynal) or the Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0 Kit. Twelve of 16 MBC RNA samples with RNA integrity numbers (RINs)>6 were assayed on Agilent oligomicroarrays at LCCC and compared with a published Agilent microarray data set also previously assayed and processed (C.M.P.) at LCCC (8,9,15). The microarray and clinical data are available at UNC Microarray Database and in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE10885). Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) was applied to perform functional analysis of gene lists. Mapping gene expression onto regions of MBC copy number change Using a Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM)-defined list of MBC-defining genes, we determined the chromosomal location of each gene to link with the CGH data.

7a21e9b65e68f010d7aa430924b7c27dc2beb8fd,Associations of MTHFR and MTRR Polymorphisms With Serum Lipid Levels in Chinese Hypertensive Patients,"Objective: To examine the effects of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) gene polymorphisms and their interactions with environmental factors on serum lipid levels. Methods: We investigated totally 340 patients with essential hypertension, from Dongzhi community, Anhui, China. High-throughput TaqMan allelic discrimination assay was used for the genotyping of MTHFR C677T (Ala222Val), MTHFR A1298C (Glu429Ala), MTRR A66G (Ile22Met), and MTRR His595Tyr. Results: Compared with the MTRR 66AA genotype carriers, the GG genotype carriers had lower serum total cholesterol (TC) levels (adjusted Î² Â± standard error [SE]: âˆ’0.5 Â± 0.2 mmol/L; P = .003) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (adjusted Î² Â± SE: âˆ’0.4 Â± 0.2 mmol/L; P = .005). Their false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P values were 0.056 and 0.056, respectively. We further found that there was a statistically significant interaction between 677TT genotype and sex in their associations with LDL levels (P interaction = .020), and significant interaction between 677TT genotype and smoking on LDL levels (P interaction = .036). A similar pattern of interaction was found between 66GG and drinking on levels of TC (P interaction = .034) and LDL (P interaction = .020). However, there were no significant interactions observed after FDR adjustment. Conclusion: Both MTHFR and MTRR gene polymorphisms could be important genetic determinants of serum lipid levels in Chinese patients with hypertension.

3e9b511efa8502865d8567c47c0909e911c23fdb,Two waves of transcriptomic changes in periovulatory human granulosa cells.,"STUDY QUESTION
How does the human granulosa cell (GC) transcriptome change during ovulation?


SUMMARY ANSWER
Two transcriptional peaks were observed at 12Â h and at 36Â h after induction of ovulation, both dominated by genes and pathways known from the inflammatory system.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
The crosstalk between GCs and the oocyte, which is essential for ovulation and oocyte maturation, can be assessed through transcriptomic profiling of GCs. Detailed transcriptional changes during ovulation have not previously been assessed in humans.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
This prospective cohort study comprised 50 women undergoing fertility treatment in a standard antagonist protocol at a university hospital-affiliated fertility clinic in 2016-2018.


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
From each woman, one sample of GCs was collected by transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration either before or 12Â h, 17Â h or 32Â h after ovulation induction (OI). A second sample was collected at oocyte retrieval, 36Â h after OI. Total RNA was isolated from GCs and analyzed by microarray. Gene expression differences between the five time points were assessed by ANOVA with a random factor accounting for the pairing of samples, and seven clusters of protein-coding genes representing distinct expression profiles were identified. These were used as input for subsequent bioinformatic analyses to identify enriched pathways and suggest upstream regulators. Subsets of genes were assessed to explore specific ovulatory functions.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
We identified 13â€‰345 differentially expressed transcripts across the five time points (false discovery rate, <0.01) of which 58% were protein-coding genes. Two clusters of mainly downregulated genes represented cell cycle pathways and DNA repair. Upregulated genes showed one peak at 12Â h that resembled the initiation of an inflammatory response, and one peak at 36Â h that resembled the effector functions of inflammation such as vasodilation, angiogenesis, coagulation, chemotaxis and tissue remodelling. Genes involved in cell-matrix interactions as a part of cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell motility were also upregulated at 36Â h. Predicted activated upstream regulators of ovulation included FSH, LH, transforming growth factor B1, tumour necrosis factor, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, coagulation factor 2, fibroblast growth factor 2, interleukin 1 and cortisol, among others. The results confirmed early regulation of several previously described factors in a cascade inducing meiotic resumption and suggested new factors involved in cumulus expansion and follicle rupture through co-regulation with previously described factors.


LARGE SCALE DATA
The microarray data were deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/, accession number: GSE133868).


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
The study included women undergoing ovarian stimulation and the findings may therefore differ from a natural cycle. However, the results confirm significant regulation of many well-established ovulatory genes from a series of previous studies such as amphiregulin, epiregulin, tumour necrosis factor alfa induced protein 6, tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidases 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, which support the relevance of the results.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
The study increases our understanding of human ovarian function during ovulation, and the publicly available dataset is a valuable resource for future investigations. Suggested upstream regulators and highly differentially expressed genes may be potential pharmaceutical targets in fertility treatment and gynaecology.

dac589a6e771847374edc7a1b1b767dd78a21f0a,Development of a long non-coding RNA signature for prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma,"Standard treatment for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (LARC) includes a combination of chemotherapy with pyrimidine analogues, such as capecitabine, and radiation therapy, followed by surgery. Currently no clinically useful genomic predictors of benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) exist for LARC. In this study we assessed the expression of 8,127 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), poorly studied in LARC, to infer their ability in classifying patients' pathological complete response (pCR). We collected and analyzed, using lncRNA-specific Agilent microarrays a consecutive series of 61 LARC cases undergoing nCRT. Potential lncRNA predictors in responders and non-responders to nCRT were identified with LASSO regression, and a model was optimized using k-fold cross-validation after selection of the three most informative lncRNA. 11 lncRNAs were differentially expressed with false discovery rate < 0.01 between responders and non-responders to NACT. We identified lnc-KLF7-1, lnc-MAB21L2-1, and LINC00324 as the most promising variable subset for classification building.

Our study shows for the first time that lncRNAs can accurately predict response in LARC undergoing nCRT.

660dfa99a622ab82bd4c76ed5ac131fb5833fcce,Advancing Standards-Free Methods for the Identification of Small Molecules in Complex Samples,"The current gold standard for unambiguous identification in metabolomics analysis is based on comparing two or more orthogonal properties from the analysis of authentic, pure reference materials (standards) to experimental data acquired in the same laboratory with the same analytical methods. This represents a significant limitation for comprehensive chemical identification of small molecules in complex samples since this process is time-consuming and costly, and the majority of molecules are not yet represented by standards, leading to a need for standards-free identification. To address this need, we are advancing chemical property calculations and developing multi-attribute scoring and matching algorithms to utilize data from multiple analytical platforms through the utilization and creation of the in silico Chemical Library Engine (ISiCLE) and the Multi-Attribute Matching Engine (MAME). Here, we describe our results in a blinded analysis of synthetic chemical mixtures as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). The blinded false negative rate (FNR), false discovery rate (FDR), and accuracy were 57%, 77%, and 91%, respectively. For high confidence identifications, the FDR was 35%. After unblinding of the sample compositions, we improved our approach by optimizing the scoring parameters used to increase confidence. The final FNR, FDR, and accuracy were 67%, 53%, and 96%, respectively. For high confidence identifications, the FDR was 10%. This study demonstrates that standards-free small molecule identification and multi-attribute matching methods can significantly reduce reliance on standards.",2018,Chemistry; Biology,"list(name = ""Jamie R.

7fb366495b353775a50cb2145373aa082d5af774,Metabolome Identification by Systematic Stable Isotope Labeling Experiments and False Discovery Analysis with a Target-Decoy Strategy,"We introduce a formula-based strategy and algorithm (JUMPm) for global metabolite identification and false discovery analysis in untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. JUMPm determines the chemical formulas of metabolites from unlabeled and stable-isotope labeled metabolome data, and derives the most likely metabolite identity by searching structure databases. JUMPm also estimates the false discovery rate (FDR) with a target-decoy strategy based on the octet rule of chemistry. With systematic stable isotope labeling of yeast, we identified 2,085 chemical formulas (10% FDR), 892 of which were assigned with metabolite structures. We evaluated JUMPm with a library of synthetic standards, and found that 96% of the formulas were correctly identified. We extended the method to mammalian cells with direct isotope labeling and by heavy yeast spike-in. This strategy and algorithm provide a powerful a practical solution for global identification of metabolites with a critical measure of confidence.",2016,Biology; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Drew Ryan Jones"", ids = ""144184884""); list(name = ""Xusheng Wang"", ids = ""51441761""); list(name = ""Timothy I.

8c5273ce74ca70c9bb3f686855abc1db012a615a,Cortical thickness maturation and duration of music training: health-promoting activities shape brain development.,"OBJECTIVE
To assess the extent to which playing a musical instrument is associated with cortical thickness development among healthy youths.


METHOD
Participants were part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Study of Normal Brain Development. This study followed a longitudinal design such that participants underwent MRI scanning and behavioral testing on up to 3 separate visits, occurring at 2-year intervals. MRI, IQ, and music training data were available for 232 youths (334 scans), ranging from 6 to 18 years of age. Cortical thickness was regressed against the number of years that each youth had played a musical instrument. Next, thickness was regressed against an ""AgeÂ Ã— Years of Playing"" interaction term. Age, gender, total brain volume, and scanner were controlled for in analyses. Participant ID was entered as a random effect to account for within-person dependence. False discovery rate correction was applied (pÂ â‰¤ .05).


RESULTS
There was no association between thickness and years playing a musical instrument. The ""AgeÂ Ã— Years of Playing"" interaction was associated with thickness in motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortices, as well as prefrontal and parietal cortices. Follow-up analysis revealed thatÂ music training was associated with an increased rate of thickness maturation. Results were largely unchanged when IQ and handedness were included as covariates.


CONCLUSION
Playing a musical instrument was associated with more rapid cortical thickness maturation within areas implicated in motor planning and coordination, visuospatial ability, and emotion and impulse regulation. However, given the quasi-experimental nature of this study, we cannot ruleÂ out theÂ influence of confounding variables.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""James J Hudziak"", ids = ""145043122""); list(name = ""Matthew D.

4d1274dd101b3ad21e44130d80bc198836c37e3e,Identifying differentially expressed genes in human acute leukemia and mouse brain microarray datasets utilizing QTModel,"One of the essential issues in microarray data analysis is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under different experimental treatments. In this article, a statistical procedure was proposed to identify the DEGs for gene expression data with or without missing observations from microarray experiment with one- or two-treatment factors. An F statistic based on Henderson method III was constructed to test the significance of differential expression for each gene under different treatment(s) levels. The cutoff P value was adjusted to control the experimental-wise false discovery rate. A human acute leukemia dataset corrected from 38 leukemia patients was reanalyzed by the proposed method. In comparison to the results from significant analysis of microarray (SAM) and microarray analysis of variance (MAANOVA), it was indicated that the proposed method has similar performance with MAANOVA for data with one-treatment factor, but MAANOVA cannot directly handle missing data. In addition, a mouse brain dataset collected from six brain regions of two inbred strains (two-treatment factors) was reanalyzed to identify genes with distinct regional-specific expression patterns. The results showed that the proposed method could identify more distinct regional-specific expression patterns than the previous analysis of the same dataset.

b4d4dd21592d2c4347d9d860a703d6b1f64ad017,White matter imaging contributes to the multimodal diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration,"Objective: To evaluate the distribution of white matter (WM) disease in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and to evaluate the relative usefulness of WM and gray matter (GM) for distinguishing these conditions in vivo. Methods: Patients were classified as having FTLD (n = 50) or AD (n = 42) using autopsy-validated CSF values of total-tau:&bgr;-amyloid (t-tau:A&bgr;1â€“42) ratios. Patients underwent WM diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric MRI of GM. We employed tract-specific analyses of WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and whole-brain GM density analyses. Individual patient classification was performed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves with FA, GM, and a combination of the 2 modalities. Results: Regional FA and GM were significantly reduced in FTLD and AD relative to healthy seniors. Direct comparisons revealed significantly reduced FA in the corpus callosum in FTLD relative to AD. GM analyses revealed reductions in anterior temporal cortex for FTLD relative to AD, and in posterior cingulate and precuneus for AD relative to FTLD. ROC curves revealed that a multimodal combination of WM and GM provide optimal classification (area under the curve = 0.938), with 87% sensitivity and 83% specificity. Conclusions: FTLD and AD have significant WM and GM defects. A combination of DTI and volumetric MRI modalities provides a quantitative method for distinguishing FTLD and AD in vivo.

1f4ef3e9cf0687b10d59da3c9077888dc7245be7,Medical consequences of pathogenic CNVs in adults: Analysis of the UK Biobank,"Background Genomic copy number variants (CNVs) increase risk for early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders but their impact on medical outcomes in later life is poorly understood. The UK Biobank, with half a million well-phenotyped adults, presents an opportunity to study the medical consequences of CNV in middle and old age. Methods We called 54 CNVs associated with clinical phenotypes or genomic disorders, including their reciprocal deletions or duplications, in all Biobank participants. We used logistic regression analysis to test CNVs for associations with 58 common medical phenotypes. Findings CNV carriers had an increased risk of developing 37 of the 58 phenotypes at nominal levels of statistical significance, with 19 associations surviving Bonferroni correction (p<8Â·6Ã—10âˆ’4). Tests of each of the 54 CNVs for association with each of the 58 phenotypes identified 18 associations that survived Bonferroni correction (p<1Â·6Ã—10âˆ’5) and a further 57 that were associated at a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0Â·1. Thirteen CNVs had three or more significant associations at FDR=0Â·1, with the largest number of phenotypes (N=15) found for deletions at 16p11Â·2. The most common CNVs (frequency 0Â·5-0Â·7%) have no or minimal impact on medical outcomes in adults. Interpretation Some of the 54 tested CNVs have profound effects on physical health, even in people who have largely escaped early neurodevelopmental outcomes. Our work provides clinicians with a morbidity map of potential outcomes among carriers of these CNVs.

To decipher this specificity in LSECs and to understand the molecular mechanism of F8 synthesis and secretion, we have compared genome wide expression and epigenetic data of fetal LSECs (N=3) and non-liver endothelial cells (HCMEC, HPAEC, HPMEC and HUVEC; N=3), hepatocytes (N=3) and adult total blood (N=3).

42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093,On the Adaptive Control of the False Discovery Rate in Multiple Testing With Independent Statistics,"A new approach to problems of multiple significance testing was presented in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), which calls for controlling the expected ratio of the number of erroneous rejections to the number of rejectionsâ€“the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The procedure given there was shown to control the FDR for independent test statistics. When some of the hypotheses are in fact false, that procedure is too conservative. We present here an adaptive procedure, where the number of true null hypotheses is estimated first as in Hochberg and Benjamini (1990), and this estimate is used in the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The result is still a simple stepwise procedure, to which we also give a graphical companion. The new procedure is used in several examples drawn from educational and behavioral studies, addressing problems in multi-center studies, subset analysis and meta-analysis. The examples vary in the number of hypotheses tested, and the implication of the new procedure on the conclusions.

17fc5b36adcb9a1d755c3ae7bf9abf41ffd65019,"Variable Selection, Sparse Meta-Analysis and Genetic Risk Prediction for Genome-Wide Association Studies","QIANCHUAN HE: Variable Selection, Sparse Meta-Analysis and Genetic Risk Prediction for Genome-Wide Association Studies (Under the direction of Dr. Danyu Lin and Dr. Hao Helen Zhang) Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) usually involve more than half a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The common practice of analyzing one SNP at a time does not fully realize the potential of GWAS to identify multiple causal variants and to predict risk of disease. Recently developed variable selection methods allow the joint analysis for GWAS data, but they tend to miss causal SNPs that are marginally uncorrelated with disease and have high false discovery rates (FDRs). Genetic risk prediction becomes highly challenging when the number of causal variants is large and many of the effects are weak. Existing methods mostly rely on marginal regression estimates, and their prediction power is quite limited. In meta-analysis, the involvement of multiple studies adds one more layer of complexity to variable selection. While existing variable selection methods can be potentially applied to meta-analysis, they require direct access to raw data, which are often difficult to be obtained. In the first part of this dissertation, we introduce GWASelect, a statistically powerful and computationally efficient variable selection method for analyzing GWAS data. This method searches iteratively over the potential SNPs conditional on previously selected SNPs and is thus capable of capturing causal SNPs that are marginally correlated with disease as well as those that are marginally uncorrelated with disease. A special resampling mechanism is built into the method to reduce false-positive findings.",2012,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Qianchuan He"", ids = ""122828715"")",,500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 4fab2c0d79c17ac2f8a85b60557bdd7200564293; 6ed0e4a022dbc09ed1e0748a4ba8c192f5dd1d90; dbc83fbe6a1832e3a93a869c9aa1cad5340c4d6f; e90868a916f206554dff1baf0d49135312549a9d; fa8216104648f5e7d4379f85bfd9ebbd8ce45710; 32e0267ce83bb139592e93f84f9e414f8980e6ff; 582bc5d5e5dc6dcb92e3665a34110ef886a115cc; 3966526fb8f15f29b5bb3e47d4757142b0a29ce1; 5e54f0a1bda9c1134c0f64f9ad266b44773a9783; d49fcaf2314659817b433b6fb13e386bc365d034; b16ab29b461cc87e76d13fdefb5bf652b64cc44c; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; 5e3c9778500da38bd75e4497239d129c509f066c; 167ea16a581a86ac31d1e88b93ee835aff43f038; fa4a12e0883fac0f41717ddccc4a380c6dcb493b; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; d26585a6fcd2c34572e7cc8d735398871b7507de; 88a2f5129a01f5a7b1a2bb4e802d046822f65a39; 6e5078293a77d8e45503606eefd43ebe1226251a; 664c35153f06262d259b83859a68b9fc0c36bb07; 3acd41eeafe82b68094fdf0a487d8781b01fb790; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; 23be7d2d5472797576f0d0840ac4c46b0996125f; 4609f6bdc3beab00c9beceaa12dd8101fefe6f1c; 458dbdfa7ad609b8dfda40d8603fb77f6b4fc53d; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; bbac4509f538eaec6fe426c09d818271d0817f54; 6267c09756bbd4e6ae5a32f51cc1c131e42a0218; 0bfd57b42c4620d3f51d0c75a3919eb9c7b73e83; 0298949078ab3ea20b7bb979f87d18e1e19a1cf6; f89be3aa29635b1e7f6c8bb40d9aa81acaf41fa5; d821cb24c0209ced57d5be4ee6bea7ea0ea663ed; cd83569a08d565d5355097d5d8f83609b19a1242; 7a31a375cfee68a8e3860c6254389744d8b429f9; 1b56affb1e76cb2b2f824ef6ff7e9d2ebd553bef; 53851da25601ee2ef7be0dfff49dd4972efcdc5d; ca15dd2b1cc9db86ee1a7c8d209e42ff5fd70da2; a0cbd181e7c85b985d893265515ce4a3484bfae5; 97eeb4d93678844ddb621db42d43a63a3a07de15; 68747e597a6a6b2f5aef5d99387965a81ed97a92; b618c1563b35023c12747867cd1164935231f262; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 3a7cf84a18fb58bd6860e7d7b9b67aeef41edbbf; 77013a15aa32c3d45d05c1fd6379326df6f567e4; dc69e42d3d2f228234d409b47e13d8d4d6ad60b7; 128c1c88ae25ef394155bd0dd763b3c51960f9f3; eda150f60acd403eae2ad47c6a2d5d78e9b250dd; fb6b4b57f431a0cfbb83bb2af8beab4ee694e94c; 0f07c69cde4ee6f453fa22f449347b470395d53f; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; 87faba923014a8db5e05e9b5414d49f382235772; b84b2e796891d791c089540546095d66097d3a25; c81d0e21e9dfaecc2791506f62432b8fd12d3050; 5ca4ffe624fffa5f1f38fbf8d23208c6a208ebea; 419c999432f38c89d4f40da5393832e73d937c89; 916896fb31354d903b91c368757c1c4cfec7a412; b0782d4f0dc197269cea37f255bf350711f4d24d; b0bdf3ae1977779a0bb1b0256819fc18c9a67f64; 40cd0d5390e62dffa655f8f6f4344629782a6ae7; 257db44aeb4d33234904bb23bbe94b9846363899; 295f37d759cd9291a450f6cf84dc8d1601a9185a; a82ad2a3b048dd02ef06a0b066ec5ab3e830ad2a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; afc473ea8e7e923246b27bd2790d71d93dffbadb; 12415ca1a247b6062579c08e8d69c8ede102fa41; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; 400b45a803d642b752a84147ef547af7811e8f3f; 89b8cf9137210312e3bff53a990256993ad364f8; 516f08882cf9cfc7d2e16312982dbd972dc31cfb; e28ba0fd6ea94bd56f277d3a89de8f47fd5d1943; d6189989ac587f0296e0d65e51faa18db947affb; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; 2ac89d4db44a965d3682e45d1e209ea353d23f2b; 4b39cb5f7dbefedb5208d389ca6413cc8b9fca1e; 7ce087a5d859df3714006ff13b0b743966444a03; 9f81a9235c57752de06fd5682bfe7cdb59b03ccf; 5d72ad3c372ef741697382b75d0be5e91a73fa3b; 0abd2b0f53f701ecdb0190d34ca088f04fd322c5; 6a10eaedec9d402fb8d8b8900994d0aa27c5e129; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; dcf5f0d067b1bd73795bfc565d275354780369c6; 7cff3ed1e0b08360b876787843494eadd34efb72; db3181e6a679edf45e3099d16251ee99693f003a; 4d1ce1c69fdf6fd2ba4ec81ce7f0a6df49c6eba9; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; b4b3d39dd7be4a1bed4b3f6694552899256ecf66; b35da6dc95124267b86fbae5b0cf952b8cbe4dd4; 99eb3005e85f1528269aa09b5417d6ce51a33c87; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; 016a3e6a223ffc431a823b428e59bb7657b30a8f; c5907b175aace726b0b9c6a1158e7f3db01100eb; 0333519bd0ba4113265e193fd839b4621d9bc44f; 8bb843b4f274d77c60944e5ac7365a2f36d76c7d; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1,,,
4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d,A note on using permutation-based false discovery rate estimates to compare different analysis methods for microarray data,"MOTIVATION
False discovery rate (FDR) is defined as the expected percentage of false positives among all the claimed positives. In practice, with the true FDR unknown, an estimated FDR can serve as a criterion to evaluate the performance of various statistical methods under the condition that the estimated FDR approximates the true FDR well, or at least, it does not improperly favor or disfavor any particular method. Permutation methods have become popular to estimate FDR in genomic studies. The purpose of this paper is 2-fold. First, we investigate theoretically and empirically whether the standard permutation-based FDR estimator is biased, and if so, whether the bias inappropriately favors or disfavors any method. Second, we propose a simple modification of the standard permutation to yield a better FDR estimator, which can in turn serve as a more fair criterion to evaluate various statistical methods.


RESULTS
Both simulated and real data examples are used for illustration and comparison. Three commonly used test statistics, the sample mean, SAM statistic and Student's t-statistic, are considered. The results show that the standard permutation method overestimates FDR. The overestimation is the most severe for the sample mean statistic while the least for the t-statistic with the SAM-statistic lying between the two extremes, suggesting that one has to be cautious when using the standard permutation-based FDR estimates to evaluate various statistical methods. In addition, our proposed FDR estimation method is simple and outperforms the standard method.",2005,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Xie"", ids = ""145668114""); list(name = ""Wei Pan"", ids = ""144282470""); list(name = ""Arkady B.

d579c98845cc90cb3c8b1895f64959ba64a0c518,Genome-wide association study of dermatomyositis reveals genetic overlap with other autoimmune disorders.,"OBJECTIVE
To identify new genetic associations with juvenile and adult dermatomyositis (DM).


METHODS
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of adult and juvenile DM patients of European ancestry (n = 1,178) and controls (n = 4,724). To assess genetic overlap with other autoimmune disorders, we examined whether 141 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, and previously associated with autoimmune diseases, predispose to DM.


RESULTS
Compared to controls, patients with DM had a strong signal in the MHC region consisting of GWAS-level significance (P < 5 Ã— 10(-8)) at 80 genotyped SNPs. An analysis of 141 non-MHC SNPs previously associated with autoimmune diseases showed that 3 SNPs linked with 3 genes were associated with DM, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05. These genes were phospholipase C-like 1 (PLCL1; rs6738825, FDR = 0.00089), B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK; rs2736340, FDR = 0.0031), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21; rs951005, FDR = 0.0076). None of these genes was previously reported to be associated with DM.


CONCLUSION
Our findings confirm the MHC as the major genetic region associated with DM and indicate that DM shares non-MHC genetic features with other autoimmune diseases, suggesting the presence of additional novel risk loci. This first identification of autoimmune disease genetic predispositions shared with DM may lead to enhanced understanding of pathogenesis and novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Frederick W Miller"", ids = ""144658138""); list(name = ""Robert G.

84a24daf63ca1a130f16eb32f2a5317a44ab113e,Contribution of Human Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells to the Hallmarks of Inflammation as Determined by Proteome Profiling.,"In order to systematically analyze proteins fulfilling effector functionalities during inflammation, here we present a comprehensive proteome study of inflammatory activated primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stimulated with interleukin 1-Î² and fractionated in order to obtain secreted, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. Proteins were submitted to a data-dependent bottom up analytical platform using a QExactive orbitrap and the MaxQuant software for protein identification and label-free quantification. Results were further combined with similarly generated data previously obtained from the analysis of inflammatory activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Applying a false discovery rate of less than 0.01 at both, peptide and protein level, a total of 8370 protein groups assembled from 117,599 peptides was identified; mass spectrometry data have been made fully accessible via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003406 to PXD003417.Comparative proteome analysis allowed us to determine common and cell type-specific inflammation signatures comprising novel candidate marker molecules and related expression patterns of transcription factors. Cardinal features of inflammation such as interleukin 1-Î² processing and the interferon response differed substantially between the investigated cells. Furthermore, cells also exerted similar inflammation-related tasks; however, by making use of different sets of proteins. Hallmarks of inflammation thus emerged, including angiogenesis, extracellular matrix reorganization, adaptive and innate immune responses, oxidative stress response, cell proliferation and differentiation, cell adhesion and migration in addition to monosaccharide metabolic processes, representing both, common and cell type-specific responsibilities of cells during inflammation.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Astrid Slany"", ids = ""6945181""); list(name = ""Andrea Bileck"", ids = ""4092664""); list(name = ""Dominique Kreutz"", ids = ""40166391""); list(name = ""Rupert L Mayer"", ids = ""33298443""); list(name = ""Besnik Muqaku"", ids = ""5921008""); list(name = ""Christopher Gerner"", ids = ""6342371"")",1ae93044318a7581d754203baad724d07a6d93b7; ededa0c38ce39774604de5cecb1dad828093a2df; 2ca53afebea28218aa8523833639fbcec9d55024; 896446a831db485abc34f74215c68c268e595798; 0956ac601b667597bdbe72b9c795aa24724e2e23; e6549ba1b7be17a825c3a16fb8a596e174d9fadc; 0730c4e4b948c85db673faa43872a5513cf59568; adcfca5a0cf88c546fbf6eff56cec4748bc4e901; e0419f122bfb1700b5e11ddbfb3899481129c1e8; 8b7e6be77fb1787f2ab213953f304fb85eb7932c; 535258d85ff6a2438259ac000a4826664d49a427; b9bb158a7d5d2899b0d724c484ce27989fa74fa6; 67ac27cf3530a2ccdcd1c9502df2e6bfa26f4dca; fc94efcb5512c2f781ca2a9372497b5297ead0b6; 039a3297bf5ab90abc7199dc23219a866da97c89,,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,15 6,"

4ea4e699faeef2d5e5a50fbc0a325a9382b2ad4f,Detecting differentially expressed genes in heterogeneous diseases using half Student's t-test.,"BACKGROUND
Microarray technology provides information about hundreds and thousands of gene-expression data in a single experiment. To search for disease-related genes, researchers test for those genes that are differentially expressed between the case subjects and the control subjects.


METHODS
The authors propose a new test, the 'half Student's t-test', specifically for detecting differentially expressed genes in heterogeneous diseases. Monte-Carlo simulation shows that the test maintains the nominal Î± level quite well for both normal and non-normal distributions. Power of the half Student's t is higher than that of the conventional 'pooled' Student's t when there is heterogeneity in the disease under study. The power gain by using the half Student's t can reach âˆ¼10% when the standard deviation of the case group is 50% larger than that of the control group.


RESULTS
Application to a colon cancer data reveals that when the false discovery rate (FDR) is controlled at 0.05, the half Student's t can detect 344 differentially expressed genes, whereas the pooled Student's t can detect only 65 genes. Or alternatively, if only 50 genes are to be selected, the FDR for the pooled Student's t has to be set at 0.0320 (false positive rate of âˆ¼3%), but for the half Student's t, it can be at as low as 0.0001 (false positive rate of about one per ten thousands).


CONCLUSIONS
The half Student's t-test is to be recommended for the detection of differentially expressed genes in heterogeneous diseases.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chun-Lun Hsu"", ids = ""13335735""); list(name = ""Wen-Chung Lee"", ids = ""34044322"")",4c44691ba49a8127d277b58c6c716fa8b68fa28c; fc62bc5e865ae77ec9f98c21a3fe6f3547f97efc; 9203bf22f30708b7e6d195929295d16af1df4fb0; 8876a76d69eb09b7a47016b7fe4bca1a05415bc0; dab29dc4e5545c96be127996607a1d95aaf9ee58; 0f6aa9cff2daa2538d78d6b7d3679ff55776a08e; c927099bfcefd1e2ad1bacb78c727b7b8edf1a51; 3a96e85a8eeafc56486321bfd8aec8ebdebb3e42; 13a259505997701bc7552364d8ea3b9aa8347867,e010584f68816b306fa038ca812d0c8b4ba011a9; 1423c9f709647decfbf3af009ae94d3514a9190f; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 80f61ca18b414417cb4455d8bd78df3416dbea93; c843d0d191ae33b53052fc8d2b49dbaf41f351b1; 0af9abdafc0b287e0e03c3af06d48d0da17522ef; 1a277639e27a9072b37bc903ebb0317bafa38102; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8407e02edbb92ade963e3150cb1886135c95966e; f7b886a3ccd077179c01c074f1351d9b9695fc3c; 8b03546320a1474ea2e793cb1436772907ff17fa; df9aa247a9462c5d40fc1394b6fb0e7b50134787; 040cf85e53e48aab1512ed8dd02d994eea0e4bcc; af9c6b21564579fea18f72859fd93b10120061eb; 5c28b24b0ecb610c6a527b32c3acb2c03b1bc184; 460bc5461711b9dec056438a9197c4565bcc8cfb,International journal of epidemiology,39 6,"

fd4b134249cbe2da4b0f727cf5f5125e9ee15be9,Transcriptomic Analysis of Prunus domestica Undergoing Hypersensitive Response to Plum Pox Virus Infection,"Plum pox virus (PPV) infects Prunus trees around the globe, posing serious fruit production problems and causing severe economic losses. One variety of Prunus domestica, named 'Jojo', develops a hypersensitive response to viral infection. Here we compared infected and non-infected samples using next-generation RNA sequencing to characterize the genetic complexity of the viral population in infected samples and to identify genes involved in development of the resistance response. Analysis of viral reads from the infected samples allowed reconstruction of a PPV-D consensus sequence. De novo reconstruction showed a second viral isolate of the PPV-Rec strain. RNA-seq analysis of PPV-infected 'Jojo' trees identified 2,234 and 786 unigenes that were significantly up- or downregulated, respectively (false discovery rate; FDRâ‰¤0.01). Expression of genes associated with defense was generally enhanced, while expression of those related to photosynthesis was repressed. Of the total of 3,020 differentially expressed unigenes, 154 were characterized as potential resistance genes, 10 of which were included in the NBS-LRR type. Given their possible role in plant defense, we selected 75 additional unigenes as candidates for further study.

1ec3c27701963f5f9bdfaf4a14c26fc34fef737b,Metabolome-Wide Association Study of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration,"PURPOSE
To determine if plasma metabolic profiles can detect differences between patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD) and similarly-aged controls.


METHODS
Metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography with Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS) was performed on plasma samples from 26 NVAMD patients and 19 controls. Data were collected from mass/charge ratio (m/z) 85 to 850 on a Thermo LTQ-FT mass spectrometer, and metabolic features were extracted using an adaptive processing software package. Both non-transformed and log2 transformed data were corrected using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple testing. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis was performed to determine metabolic features that distinguished NVAMD patients from controls. Individual m/z features were matched to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and the Metlin metabolomics database, and metabolic pathways associated with NVAMD were identified using MetScape.


RESULTS
Of the 1680 total m/z features detected by LC-FTMS, 94 unique m/z features were significantly different between NVAMD patients and controls using FDR (q = 0.05). A comparison of these features to those found with log2 transformed data (n = 132, q = 0.2) revealed 40 features in common, reaffirming the involvement of certain metabolites. Such metabolites included di- and tripeptides, covalently modified amino acids, bile acids, and vitamin D-related metabolites. Correlation analysis revealed associations among certain significant features, and pathway analysis demonstrated broader changes in tyrosine metabolism, sulfur amino acid metabolism, and amino acids related to urea metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
These data suggest that metabolomic analysis can identify a panel of individual metabolites that differ between NVAMD cases and controls. Pathway analysis can assess the involvement of certain metabolic pathways, such as tyrosine and urea metabolism, and can provide further insight into the pathophysiology of AMD.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Melissa P.

STUDY DESIGN: Human myometrium from the lower uterine segment was obtained at the time of cesarean section in patients in four clinical groups: 1) not in labor at term (n=9); 2) early labor at term (n=9); 3) arrest of dilatation (n=10); and 4) arrest of descent (n=9). Patients with histologic chorioamnionitis were excluded. Gene expression was characterized using Affymetrix HGU133plus2 microarrays. Data pre-processing was performed using RMA and GC-RMA algorithms. A moderated t test was used to detect differential expression, and a false discovery rate adjustment of the p values was applied to correct for multiple testing (p!0.05). RESULTS: 1) No differences in the myometrial transcriptome were found between women not in labor and women in labor after adjusting for multiple comparisons; 2) Arrest of dilatation as well as arrest of descent had a stereotypic transcriptome that differed significantly from that of women not in labor at term. Of interest is that the number of differentially expressed genes characterizing the arrest of dilatation (w5300 probesets) was nearly double the one characterizing the arrest of descent (w2800 probesets). CONCLUSION: 1) Contrary to our expectations, no changes in the lower uterine segment myometrial transcriptome were demonstrated in spontaneous labor at term; 2) Arrest of dilatation and arrest of descent showed stereotypical changes in the myometrial transcriptome, suggesting that either major changes in the transcriptome may not occur acutely during labor or that the present global transcriptome analysis is insensitive to detect the changes required for physiologic, but not pathologic, parturition.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Pooja Mittal"", ids = ""2617153""); list(name = ""Adi L Tarca"", ids = ""2490889""); list(name = ""Sorin Draghici"", ids = ""1775019""); list(name = ""Jimmy Espinoza"", ids = ""144406090""); list(name = ""Jyh Kae Nien"", ids = ""4042258""); list(name = ""Ricardo Gomez"", ids = ""145337325""); list(name = ""Bo Hyun Yoon"", ids = ""145895420""); list(name = ""Juan Pedro Kusanovic"", ids = ""1987876""); list(name = ""Sonia S.

However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Pre-existing methods for pseudotime estimation have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kieran R.

We consider the two-stage logistic regression model along with pseudo-conditional likelihood estimation method and design a testing strategy based on Rao's score test. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out, false discovery rate and statistical power of the suggested test are investigated. Simulation results indicate that applying the proposed testing strategy, even a small degree of true etiologic heterogeneity can be recovered with a large statistical power from the sampled data.

4df0196d1ca65d5461b9ba749d9ef060bccf3332,Tryptic peptide reference data sets for MALDI imaging mass spectrometry on formalin-fixed ovarian cancer tissues.,"MALDI imaging mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for morphology-based proteomic tissue analysis. However, peptide identification is still a major challenge due to low S/N ratios, low mass accuracy and difficulties in correlating observed m/z species with peptide identities. To address this, we have analyzed tryptic digests of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue microarray cores, from 31 ovarian cancer patients, by LC-MS/MS. The sample preparation closely resembled the MALDI imaging workflow in order to create representative reference data sets containing peptides also observable in MALDI imaging experiments. This resulted in 3844 distinct peptide sequences, at a false discovery rate of 1%, for the entire cohort and an average of 982 distinct peptide sequences per sample. From this, a total of 840 proteins and, on average, 297 proteins per sample could be inferred. To support the efforts of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project Consortium, we have annotated these proteins with their respective chromosome location. In the presented work, the benefit of using a large cohort of data sets was exemplified by correct identification of several m/z species observed in a MALDI imaging experiment.

9259b4faef8932a7aa11b2e7dec854c6a1e68ef6,The Histone Methyltransferase Setd8 Represses Gata2 Expression and Regulates Erythroid Maturation,"The maturation of a committed erythroid progenitor to a functional red blood cell is a complex process that involves significant changes in gene expression during a time of rapid cell division and nuclear condensation. Posttranslational modifications of histone proteins are critical determinates of erythroid gene expression, however the histone modifications required to execute the erythroid-specific transcriptional program during maturation are incompletely understood. Setd8 is the sole histone methyltransferase in mammals capable of generating mono-methylated histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1). Setd8 and H4K20me1 are transcriptional regulators that also play an important role in mediating nuclear condensation, cell cycle progression and response to DNA damage (Beck, Genes Dev 2012). Setd8 is expressed throughout the maturation of murine and human erythroid cells (Kingsley et al, Blood 2012; An et al, Blood 2014), and erythroid precursors have significantly higher levels of Setd8 expression than any other cell- or tissue- type (biogps.org), suggesting that Setd8 may have an erythroid-specific function. Data regarding the function of Setd8 in erythroid cells is limited; with the only published study to date linking Setd8 to Gata1-mediated repression (DeVilbiss, PNAS 2013). We hypothesize that mono-methylation of H4K20 by Setd8 is a critical mediator of transcriptional repression during erythroid maturation. 

To test this hypothesis, lentiviral mediated shRNA was utilized to generate stable knockdown of Setd8 in extensively self-renewing erythroblasts (ESREs). ESREs are a well-characterized, non-transformed model of erythroid maturation (Getman et al, Exp Hematol 2014), which are cultured from yolk sac or fetal liver. Once the culture is established, ESREs self-renew extensively at the proerythroblast stage, without losing the ability to mature and enucleate in approximately three days (England et al, Blood 2012). Knockdown of Setd8 was confirmed at the mRNA (~70% knockdown) and protein level (~50% knockdown), and persisted throughout maturation. Setd8 knockdown did not alter ESRE proliferation or viability, or result in accumulation of DNA damage. As expected, Setd8 knockdown was associated with a significant decline in H4K20me1 compared to scramble controls. Setd8 knockdown resulted in a significant delay in hemoglobin accumulation as determined by benzidine staining. Setd8 knockdown also significantly impaired several facets of erythroid maturation, resulting in larger cell area, persistent kit expression, incomplete nuclear condensation, and lower rates of enucleation than control cells.

To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities in erythroid maturation, global gene expression was analyzed by RNA-seq in biological replicates of Setd8 knockdown and scramble samples. CuffDiff was used for differential expression analyses. 1149 genes were differentially expressed (p-value<10-3, False Discovery Rate<0.01). Consistent with the repressor function of Setd8, 780 genes were upregulated (including Gata2) and 369 genes were downregulated (including Setd8, Pklr, Alad, Tfrc, and Hbb-b1.) The top three networks identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analyses of the differentially expressed genes were Hematologic Development and Disease, Hereditary Disorder, and Cell Signaling/DNA Recombination and Repair. The increased Gata2 expression was validated using qPCR in independent Setd8 knockdown cultures.

Gata2 is a critical regulator of the balance between maturation and self-renewal in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and Gata2 overexpression is sufficient to impair erythroid maturation (Ikonomi et al, Exp Hematol 2000). The Gata2 gene has both general (1G) and hematopoietic specific (1S) promoters, as well as several well-characterized enhancers that control its spatial and temporal expression (Grass et al, MCB 2006). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated Setd8 occupancy at the Gata2 1S promoter and at the critical +9.5 enhancer. Knockdown of Setd8 resulted in loss of Setd8 occupancy in the Gata2 locus and an increase in histone H4 acetylation at the Gata2 1S promoter. Taken together, these results indicate that Setd8 is an important transcriptional regulator of erythroid cells and suggest that Setd8 facilitates erythroid maturation by repressing Gata2 expression.

4e24fbc2fc38cde7bc9c09a0fb58a3d8f4200b95,Impact of transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation or resistance exercise on skeletal muscle mRNA expression in COPD,"Background: Voluntary resistance exercise (RE) training increases muscle mass and strength in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Nonvolitional transcutaneous neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may be an alternative strategy for reducing ambulatory muscle weakness in patients unable to perform RE training, but little comparative data are available. This study, therefore, investigated changes in muscle mRNA abundance of a number of gene targets in response to a single bout of NMES compared with RE. Methods: Twenty-six patients with stable COPD (15 male; FEV1, 43Â±18% predicted; age, 64Â±8 years; fat free mass index, 16.6Â±1.8 kg/m2) undertook 30 minutes of quadriceps NMES (50 Hz, current at the limit of tolerance) or 5Ã—30 maximal voluntary isokinetic knee extensions. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained at rest immediately before and 24 hours after intervention. Expression of 384 targeted mRNA transcripts was assessed by real time TaqMan PCR. Significant change in expression from baseline was determined using the Î”Î”CT method with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <5%. Results: NMES and RE altered mRNA abundance of 18 and 68 genes, respectively (FDR <5%), of which 14 genes were common to both interventions and of the same magnitude of fold change. Biological functions of upregulated genes included inflammation, hypertrophy, muscle protein turnover, and muscle growth, whilst downregulated genes included mitochondrial and cell signaling functions. Conclusions: Compared with NMES, RE had a broader impact on mRNA abundance and, therefore, appears to be the superior intervention for maximizing transcriptional responses in the quadriceps of patients with COPD. However, if voluntary RE is not feasible in a clinical setting, NMES by modifying expression of genes known to impact upon muscle mass and strength may have a positive influence on muscle function.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lorna E.

These phosphopeptide pools are too complex to be completely unraveled by RP-LC-MS analysis alone. Here, we implement weak anion exchange (WAX) chromatography as an additional, complementary dimension to strong cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase (RP). Initially, we used SCX to fractionate a human lysate digest to generate a fraction highly enriched for phosphopeptides. Analysis of this single fraction by RP-LC-MS with a 140 min gradient method allowed the identification of 4045 unique phosphopeptides (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%; Mascot score > 20) using an Orbitrap Velos. Triplicate analysis (420 min total gradient time) of the same sample increased the total to just over 5000 unique phosphopeptides. When we separated the same sample by WAX and analyzed 14 WAX fractions by 30 min gradient RP-LC-MS (420 min total gradient time) we were able to identify 7251 unique phosphopeptides, an approximate increase of 40%, while maintaining the same total gradient time. We performed a more comprehensive, albeit also more time-consuming, analysis of the same 14 WAX fractions by the use of 140 min gradient LC-MS analyses, which resulted in the detection of over 11â€‰000 unique phosphopeptides. Our results clearly demonstrate that additional separation dimensions are still necessary for in-depth phosphoproteomics and that WAX is a suitable dimension to be combined and sandwiched between SCX and RP chromatography.",2011,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marco L Hennrich"", ids = ""5490185""); list(name = ""Vincent Groenewold"", ids = ""4769949""); list(name = ""Geert J.P.L.

3dfa07699e8a79d7bbe984902b00e74aa9a53440,Global gene expression as a function of germline genetic variation.,"Common, functional, germline genetic polymorphisms have been associated with clinical cancer outcomes. Little attention has been paid to the potential phenotypic consequences of germline genetic variation on downstream genes. We determined the germline status of 16 well-characterized functional polymorphisms in 126 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed whether global gene expression profiles of diagnostic ALL blasts from the same patients differed by these germline polymorphic genotypes. Gene expression values were adjusted for ALL-subtype-specific patterns. Of the 16 loci, only the UGT1A1 promoter repeat polymorphism [A(TA)nTAA] (UGT1A1*28) and GSTM1 deletion were significant predictors of global gene expression in a supervised approach, which divided patients based on their germline genotypes [UGT1A1: 124 probe sets, false discovery rate (FDR)=13%, P< or =0.0031; GSTM1: 112 probe sets, FDR=42.5%, P< or =0.0084]. Genes whose expression distinguished the UGT1A1 (TA) 7/7 genotype from the other UGT1A1 genotypes included HDAC1, RELA and SLC2A1; those that distinguished the GSTM1 null genotype from non-null genotype included NBS1 and PRKR. In an unsupervised approach, the gene expression profiles using the entire array delineated two major clusters of patients. The only germline genotype frequency that differed between the two clusters was UGT1A1 (P=0.002; Fisher's exact test). Although their expression is limited to specific tissues, both GSTM1 and UGT1A1 are involved in the conjugation (and thus transport, excretion and lipophilicity) of a broad range of endobiotics and xenobiotics, which could plausibly have consequences for gene expression in different tissues.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Deborah L.

Interactions of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) in heat selected yeast are analysed by comparing them to an unselected pool of random individuals. Data on individual F12 progeny selected for heat tolerance, which have been genotyped at 25 locations identified by sequencing a selected pool, are re-examined. 960 individuals were genotyped at these locations and multi-locus genotype frequencies were compared to 172 sequenced individuals from the original unselected pool. We use Relative Information Gain (RIG) for analysis of associations between loci. Correlation analysis in many pairs of loci requires multi testing methods. Two multi testing approaches are applied for selection of associations: False Discovery Rate (FDR) in the version suggested by J.D. Storey and R. Tibshirani and specially developed Bootstrap Test of ordered RIG (BToRIG). We show that a statistical analysis of entropy and information gain in genotypes of a selected population can reveal further interactions than previously seen. Importantly this is done in comparison to the unselected populationâ€™s genotypes to account for inherent biases in the original population.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Evgeny M Mirkes"", ids = ""34796800""); list(name = ""Terri J.

Candida albicans public proteomic datasets, though growing steadily in the last few years, still have a very limited presence in online repositories. We report here the creation of a C. albicans PeptideAtlas comprising near 22,000 distinct peptides at a 0.24% False Discovery Rate (FDR) that account for over 2500 canonical proteins at a 1.2% FDR. Based on data from 16 experiments, we attained coverage of 41% of the C. albicans open reading frame sequences (ORFs) in the database used for the searches. This PeptideAtlas provides several useful features, including comprehensive protein and peptide-centered search capabilities and visualization tools that establish a solid basis for the study of basic biological mechanisms key to virulence and pathogenesis such as dimorphism, adherence, and apoptosis. Further, it is a valuable resource for the selection of candidate proteotypic peptides for targeted proteomic experiments via Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) or SWATH-MS.


BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE
This C. albicans PeptideAtlas resolves the previous absence of fungal pathogens in the PeptideAtlas project. It represents the most extensive characterization of the proteome of this fungus that exists up to the current date, including evidence for uncharacterized ORFs. Through its web interface, PeptideAtlas supports the study of interesting proteins related to basic biological mechanisms key to virulence such as apoptosis, dimorphism and adherence. It also provides a valuable resource to select candidate proteotypic peptides for future (SRM) targeted proteomic experiments.

3f17d6fd312ce63df4806e534efe1ae0dade34ae,Comparison of false discovery rate methods in identifying genes with differential expression.,"Current high-throughput techniques such as microarray in genomics or mass spectrometry in proteomics usually generate thousands of hypotheses to be tested simultaneously. The usual purpose of these techniques is to identify a subset of interesting cases that deserve further investigation. As a consequence, the control of false positives among the tests called ""significant"" becomes a critical issue for researchers. Over the past few years, several false discovery rate (FDR)-controlling methods have been proposed; each method favors certain scenarios and is introduced with the purpose of improving the control of FDR at the targeted level. In this paper, we compare the performance of the five FDR-controlling methods proposed by Benjamini et al., the qvalue method proposed by Storey, and the traditional Bonferroni method. The purpose is to investigate the ""observed"" sensitivity of each method on typical microarray experiments in which the majority (or all) of the truth is unknown. Based on two well-studied microarray datasets, it is found that in terms of the ""apparent"" test power, the ranking of the FDR methods is given as Step-down<Step-up: dependent<Step-up: one-stage (BH95)<Step-up adaptive<qvalue. The BH95 method shows the best control of FDR at the target level. It is our hope that the observed results could provide some insight into the application of different FDR methods in microarray data analysis.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hui-Rong Qian"", ids = ""83429650""); list(name = ""Shuguang Huang"", ids = ""48668993"")",9ade5071a880998b0f61ebbd5bfcf093e563e7e4; aa3d5a8449918f1b450d6e2aa2a0a322128745c3; cd3a5d4ac0051fabd6fc1e7e80799fba20f43ca9; 1df605d62d915018e2015d23cc1a8173411d050b; 5e575cc7d4cee040320fd858e330642523b43734; 1773730355bafc997e4e7a4161ef57c5f6e69404; 5dac8a358f23645a0cf16797ce6008fa4461103f; bf28821922d50c5fb4f20176f29c3d1a647b0e0b; 7ee7389242c63bb1bd9c318be38eb26964d336f0; d41b6eca551a40f1a3f0648d10073ba0166b2bf1; 37311bd4c9cfadd9b93d6b39c55705a117de21d8; 5457f90cd779b4004d47e9173e6f7c010878cb23; e5282eecd0ff527cde9001b24c7020c7e7362d09; e05dee4a5418d40e7b1f6f502faddf888869c4a3; aa5eac22e986899598c8eb1ece008a5e667dd3a5; cd4b527ef2c86e6c6a065031eee9e845cd403a4c; 6a74fd3e889b65ed606721ea97717a6ff8819181; c2d6b148d61d061237bf0184855c1ea50ea30cb8; 69a673b1742e566e5f3be4546aca7f832cfac14b; 0d7ee26e246fdd221ddb20119ec089d2827cdfab; a749231282efc1f88aca2aa6144f1aaceefcbe21; 49aebb3b8a3704e9a8cce8ed7b2cdd8fcbb3a27e; 85efb84b37de1bb4b8b080085f52fcd38677272f; 2864ece23be65b562842923b6777a6a49a0e2a0e; 1d83abca875e2f3a2503bf3f6dbdf3c152849b7c; 1baefb93546ac30e0274cf6deb702b95aa89d413; 10468643c03106983769c387ebb35a68c43301c4; a7c6cd82cd51ee067c740d6d872eddf6bd7c763c; c98bb47ba9e3c564b5468acdcbc62400291b62bc; e3d7f293b1411dad7699df89ccb64842c50544f1; a3af52a76791e56f9189bb4704242e4a34469955; 0d226d38d588f3eebff1f81d9957fea841a1fd64; 3983869a45db575737795449d07ebdcedcd419a7; 1b368c917666525ca697d23e958cc4a6c3dfb7ac; 2234c4f3c5313852bd2b3f0100262da2d3be61dd; 5977d1479e4b8f4639c51792fc1079f62f0c38c2; 587768d160f42ed7e3501f96d0ee5ed566027922; 5f4d09fcfb0512852cb0513c2c8f8dc5700c1f91,,Genomics,86 4,"

7515837c0741ce0e7afd02519fc82d1d60958d42,Behavioral metabolomics analysis identifies novel neurochemical signatures in methamphetamine sensitization.,"Behavioral sensitization has been widely studied in animal models and is theorized to reflect neural modifications associated with human psychostimulant addiction. While the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway is known to play a role, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying behavioral sensitization remain incompletely understood. In this study, we conducted the first metabolomics analysis to globally characterize neurochemical differences associated with behavioral sensitization. Methamphetamine (MA)-induced sensitization measures were generated by statistically modeling longitudinal activity data for eight inbred strains of mice. Subsequent to behavioral testing, nontargeted liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry profiling was performed on 48 brain samples, yielding 301 metabolite levels per sample after quality control. Association testing between metabolite levels and three primary dimensions of behavioral sensitization (total distance, stereotypy and margin time) showed four robust, significant associations at a stringent metabolome-wide significance threshold (false discovery rate, FDR <0.05). Results implicated homocarnosine, a dipeptide of GABA and histidine, in total distance sensitization, GABA metabolite 4-guanidinobutanoate and pantothenate in stereotypy sensitization, and myo-inositol in margin time sensitization. Secondary analyses indicated that these associations were independent of concurrent MA levels and, with the exception of the myo-inositol association, suggest a mechanism whereby strain-based genetic variation produces specific baseline neurochemical differences that substantially influence the magnitude of MA-induced sensitization. These findings demonstrate the utility of mouse metabolomics for identifying novel biomarkers, and developing more comprehensive neurochemical models, of psychostimulant sensitization.",2013,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel E.

390437a7a7ad298a68b08c538afb36de0816b128,Serotonin system gene polymorphisms are associated with impulsivity in a context dependent manner,"Impulsivity is a risk factor for adverse outcomes and characterizes several psychiatric disorders and risk for suicide. There is strong evidence that genetic variation influences individual differences in impulsivity, but the details are not yet understood. There is growing interest in better understanding the context dependency of genetic effects that is reflected in studies examining gender specificity, geneÃ—environment interaction and epistasis (gene-gene interaction). In a cross-sectional study we examined whether polymorphisms in six serotonin system candidate genes and the experience of early life trauma (age 0-12) were associated with individual differences in impulsivity in a non-clinical sample of Caucasian university students (N=424). We specifically tested potential gender specific, gene-gene, and geneÃ—environment (early life trauma) effects. In our main analyses with Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) total score, there were significant (i.e. p<.01 and False Discovery Rate <.10) interactions between (1) gender and TPH2 (rs1386483) genotype; (2) gender and HTR2A (rs6313) genotype; and epistatic interactions among (3) 5-HTTLPR and MAOA uVNTR; (4) 5-HTTLPR and rs6313 and (5) HTR1B (rs6296) and rs6313 genotypes. Our results strongly support the explicit investigation of context dependent genetic effects on impulsivity and may help to resolve some of the conflicting reports in the literature.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Scott F Stoltenberg"", ids = ""5594894""); list(name = ""Christa C.

95cb0258cca52c52b7deee71b6299bd256d0fa59,Radiation-induced functional connectivity alterations in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with radiotherapy,"AbstractThe study aims to investigate the radiation-induced brain functional alterations in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients who received radiotherapy (RT) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and statistic scale.The fMRI data of 35 NPC patients with RT and 24 demographically matched untreated NPC patients were acquired. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was also measured to evaluate their global cognition performance. Multivariate pattern analysis was performed to find the significantly altered functional connections between these 2 groups, while the linear correlation level was detected between the altered functional connections and the MoCA scores.Forty-five notably altered functional connections were found, which were mainly located between 3 brain networks, the cerebellum, sensorimotor, and cingulo-opercular. With strictly false discovery rate correction, 5 altered functional connections were shown to have significant linear correlations with the MoCA scores, that is, the connections between the vermis and hippocampus, cerebellum lobule VI and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus and dorsal frontal cortex, cuneus and middle occipital lobe, and insula and cuneus. Besides, the connectivity between the vermis and hippocampus was also significantly correlated with the attention score, 1 of the 7 subscores of the MoCA.The present study provides new insights into the radiation-induced functional connectivity impairments in NPC patients. The results showed that the RT may induce the cognitive impairments, especially the attention alterations. The 45 altered functional connections, especially the 5 altered functional connections that were significantly correlated to the MoCA scores, may serve as the potential biomarkers of the RT-induced brain functional impairments and provide valuable targets for further functional recovery treatment.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qiongmin Ma"", ids = ""4836111""); list(name = ""Donglin Wu"", ids = ""48198554""); list(name = ""Ling-Li Zeng"", ids = ""40092507""); list(name = ""Hui Shen"", ids = ""144787557""); list(name = ""Dewen Hu"", ids = ""46570618""); list(name = ""Shijun Qiu"", ids = ""2330990"")",647e51364b681d38491b72dad8ff8270b9b7b7dc; 46764e86bba6ee8feadf8a3f3b1acfbea4e14ade; 7c52e64c2488f02da4b2a517e4fd7ffc98066638; b3e58c996a1994ebe79ffd9b836af35e33d4bb16; f9b3aaa76bc2dd4e7983be9687d7d8f5020fe4dc; da3625c49dc998a90bd2ab6495a8a003d581c74f; 2c2ffce9a5641933266b0fff2ed8de4af18c4064; 543f85c6311cacb64877423700027757b2720a8b; 94b2cdffbc00e510c08b80ae6e79af2f49c502dc; 80874d21f56c2ca1ddc78c3de9a9a170b9635e06; 7b36223bca8cbfcaead2611f6f7a8560611eb4ef; 6e9258c3459bed57f2cede8bb9cec8a20cb82382; b6df0facd2e6c537f958f7585646aa83560018d7; 6e66d5812f8c3b76d50366d1f759ed1266c58bab,55b7637a30cb22fa5256c7363435a97262e43eea; 25793259a06ee170f5fd3204a23d01173467d745; 7db1ff5db3aa80f8e4509d700b0b60f07be042d9; 995a49dc9506a324f79d6d1aca52a98ca8c79c94; 24523570069979b085d3645429ff43a739cfeed4; 82a0a2466113c5daa44e20d32aba6f4f7712f7ba; 43fd17fec9e0bcd00bb68de7c4a17bb70723d13d; adbea2efe156c1926f4e42490dfa8113fe40dc35; 3949b877728a65f207cbebd298680bfb166737a9; d17276895bcc64ae2ad217e558e152f8a91eac03; d77a16a1df28a2ecb0b727f7aa7359ff5334cdff; 44445803eb255772b8ba49e6c1d2fb7bc8001c2b; 6d9c6305154e834ab77e6b458df65781a519713f; 78e99461cfd8a1d3e995a6a39af45237a3a2241c; 0e5e9f52eadee1151e527a1ffe576afed15adcef; bdca4176a6cc2d285605c439843ae42a4331e1f1; 409cbeafc42c841628dcff2dfb373cd1c32a4820; 72cfadd36a70360e9e98bd97c44bd38a108bb91e; e9c13a84f512d9c8412549ebffa0c48a0970eb2a; 195c6e2ee960c9f636edee7f550286484c6c230a; de1a3732b4424a755634b500448c29f44b8ea27f; 433a5953e6d47befd21ff184ee19d8948e2c95fb; 62df185ddf7cd74040dd7f8dd72a9a2d85b734ed; 00a5990f909feacecd4f97c36f62fc5a9a60a58d; 44f5764158b2a65f60bfb7b9d9f438368fa5bebb; 86ebfa8ad75d3578b32ec87777854410e7148ada; e1092cb98a2ad678093990127cf572b8faca1e91; e0164d39f371e35366e879a34737eb8a2d4c9e60; 50e73257ee25e3e7c2dc38170d8f59024ccf883d; 66f62382df3ba57394693e3894ecab23a62a838b; c9a6a67fa10c1dc4c9d3a66a92a17c0594666d5f; 243c6f0bf9ad774b2808fe0212ab67262f7f7718; 49055bc89483aa68885c2ecd2d8ada9730597918; 8d8893f0849ad6bb50c8b9f75f89aa48eae51ddb; 55205151b8b3539db68a4d2782a0ce7a74f50910; 3efa8cbd4a80e0464892159654ced4b0d2439df2; b6ad9f4aaebb7906ccee95207ca727121803eeb8; 707ad7cdaceaf9740f2a0c5da2a88de6ee27fed6; 338bfe37e98a99065b8d03df695ee157ca92dba9; 480232f9b132dccae5a752ac1f7e8057ec83cfd8; 1eef58aa308a40239544c15814c54be4c705349f; 26f05160613d2e1ee4647c9a7e14d7554e55c50c; 9b80419559c86cf1925ff2b9994f34acad99d082; dcbe05b068466d5b40c049a468efcf1b82fecc5a; fe2924a01e71150e4674a367fdfa37c271938531; 6dd08648181dcb035fd192e2b8157970c5d9813b; 3f60d6a90bac66a838ae6e8801e50f51358202a9,Medicine,95,

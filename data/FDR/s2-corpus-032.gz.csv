fca5cad38d1d8ecf586a7c7b734be03eb9be8cea,Increased odds and predictive rates of MMPI-2-RF scale elevations in patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and observed sex differences,"OBJECTIVE
The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) is a self-report instrument, previously shown to differentiate patients with epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). At present, the odds of MMPI-2-RF scale elevations in PNES patients, as well as the diagnostic predictive value of such scale elevations, remain largely unexplored. This can be of clinical utility, particularly when a diagnosis is uncertain.


METHOD
After looking at mean group differences, we applied contingency table derived odds ratios to a sample of ES (n=92) and PNES (n=77) patients from a video EEG (vEEG) monitoring unit. We also looked at the positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), as well as the false discovery rate (FDR) and false omission rate (FOR) for scales found to have increased odds of elevation in PNES patients. This was completed for the overall sample, as well as the sample stratified by sex.


RESULTS
The odds of elevations related to somatic concerns, negative mood, and suicidal ideation in the PNES sample ranged from 2 to 5 times more likely. Female PNES patients had 3-6 times greater odds of such scale elevations, while male PNES patients had odds of 5-15 times more likely. PPV rates ranged from 53.66% to 84.62%, while NPV rates ranged from 47.52% to 90.91%. FDR across scales ranged from 15.38% to 50%, while the FOR ranged from 9.09% to 52.47%.


CONCLUSIONS
Consistent with prior research, PNES patients have greater odds of MMPI-2-RF scale elevations, particularly related to somatic concerns and mood disturbance. Female PNES patients endorsed greater emotional distress, including endorsement of suicide related items. Elevations of these scales could aid in differentiating PNES from ES patients, although caution is warranted due to the possibility of both false positives and the incorrect omissions of PNES cases.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Victor A.

3fe04249376ae1c6eaa276bee3ef19f9e5b495b2,Characterization of the MDSC Proteome Associated with Metastatic Murine Mammary Tumors Using Label-Free Mass Spectrometry and Shotgun Proteomics,"Expansion of Gr-1+/CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is governed by the presence of increasingly metastatic, malignant primary tumors. Metastasis, not the primary tumor, is often the cause of mortality. This study sought to fully characterize the MDSC proteome in response to metastatic and non-metastatic mammary tumors using label-free mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics in a mouse model with tumor cell lines, 67NR and 4T1, derived from the same tumor. 67NR cells form only primary mammary tumors, whereas 4T1 cells readily metastasize to the lungs, lymph nodes, and blood. Overall analysis identified a total of 2825 protein groups with a 0.78% false discovery rate. Of the 2814 true identifications, 43 proteins were exclusive to the 67NR group, 153 were exclusive to the 4T1 group, and 2618 were shared. Among the shared cohort, 26 proteins were increased and 31 were decreased in the metastatic 4T1 cohort compared to non-metastatic 67NR controls after filtering. MDSCs selectively express proteins involved in the Î³-glutamyl transferase, glutathione synthase pathways, CREB transcription factor signaling, and other pathways involved in platelet aggregation, as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism, in response to highly metastatic 4T1 tumors. Cell cycle regulation dominated protein pathways and ontological groups of the 67NR non-metastatic group. Not only does this study provide a starting point to identify potential biomarkers of metastasis expressed by MDSCs; it identifies critical pathways that are unique to non-metastatic and metastatic conditions. Therapeutic interventions aimed at these pathways in MDSC may offer a new route to control malignancy and metastasis.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Angela M BouttÃ©"", ids = ""3891035""); list(name = ""W.

7941222f72eaeef3d656e4dde8145fa1669eb25d,Effects of 30 min of aerobic exercise on gene expression in human neutrophils.,"Relatively brief bouts of exercise alter gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but whether exercise changes gene expression in circulating neutrophils (whose numbers, like PBMCs, increase) is not known. We hypothesized that exercise would activate neutrophil genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, and cell growth and repair, since these functions in leukocytes are known to be influenced by exercise. Blood was sampled before and immediately after 30 min of constant, heavy ( approximately 80% peak O(2) uptake) cycle ergometer exercise in 12 healthy men (19-29 yr old) of average fitness. Neutrophils were isolated using density gradients; RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U133+2 Genechip arrays. With false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 with 95% confidence, a total of 526 genes were differentially expressed between before and after exercise. Three hundred and sixteen genes had higher expression after exercise. The Jak/STAT pathway, known to inhibit apoptosis, was significantly activated (EASE score, P < 0.005), but 14 genes were altered in a way likely to accelerate apoptosis as well. Similarly, both proinflammatory (e.g., IL-32, TNFSF8, and CCR5) and anti-inflammatory (e.g., ANXA1) were affected. Growth and repair genes like AREG and FGF2 receptor genes (involved in angiogenesis) were also activated.

ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a,Gaussian graphical model estimation with false discovery rate control,"This paper studies the estimation of high dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). Typically, the existing methods depend on regularization techniques. As a result, it is necessary to choose the regularized parameter. However, the precise relationship between the regularized parameter and the number of false edges in GGM estimation is unclear. Hence, it is impossible to evaluate their performance rigorously. In this paper, we propose an alternative method by a multiple testing procedure. Based on our new test statistics for conditional dependence, we propose a simultaneous testing procedure for conditional dependence in GGM. Our method can control the false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically. The numerical performance of the proposed method shows that our method works quite well.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Weidong Liu"", ids = ""40474857"")",942ecfb19ae7c97f0c2d445676af1a258ced11c5; 958af62fbcb24e6f128abacd0f6fee81c02f4db7; 4df1d21ed859cd9f81445517e84fbaf3a8e0ed90; e576415557f8fa16205b682eef79bd63e258af74; a2f2ee1b23982b32c57d12ddf24922ab2263f28d; 9999400a0d78294af41d1d5df7997a1276ab4a0c; 67616e256eb95ee54d4e7aec33287f249c902e69; ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877; ab444bb0ba62803350fd1bdb560ab45b2b4656a8; 6de25f28f84c031d066466e04576b7038b85a403; 6f0babac6ec9c2c0f12e5dd8997efbc739bff3bf; 5e0e380befb9304a0ab0d70ec9ff62a255c874df; 0c06505aa991c5db9bea3c315bdd42999a41124a; a1a51add3fea1127fee393f0160efe173d66aebe; 975dfc7919678e573ec25999840500223cae8221; 1ab521a0ec7f2ad3ba14ab3700cfce4fd373a946; 106e237c73d25ec5bdad7a41625eb19a071b6992; 04b3f0108b0edbcd4905f57a8a813ffdd2e9b4ba; c7d0d2fbb1deb103cd38742da981bc14e979d474; 5a35c30a72ba80d5be4184801dbb615b421cacad; e7f28bdce400e54dadc0aa1e0e84b2b17b95754b; 8885d8c54744aea171056b6db6ebfe98511f1d76; f16ae5182b55b8f7c54527c2e43fdc944385bd99; 668518aeabdbb79d5294d80b7e2081f05c95e320; e315b88587b2769d3f7df5c4dacb19ece3c05948; 28ba70019c019e32a0abbab0c6c39fc64335db36; 9165b85d73188bd8d29ac1a47d8142c727ebcb92; 3457428e6fd6c6a093aa0675a7354c59ed44e606; b2cb8c76da40c2489babc3bb5db0fcd8e7b715d6; 233428ecef639526d4acfe06f89acb54550c2e51; 922260aeb40382c89f361507a44defdb97da5a22; 1d61f51f7b003418286e775853187ef59bc618d9; 20a8f0417c346b7e04aaf2d6fd239f8c10c97805; 8fcf82a9f9bec00852d8d9fc5f9753811cfa3b4d; 509e51d4711724f82103802b97c8ae4f746c89ef; da5a6f4bcc3d0a51ef73bc068f7f4254af8d5e19; e3cc925b4469d2bee7cf8591fbbe81f360aafbe3; 585bb6c9f4acb311848f24cd7151f59d8ac458dc; edd520619987a2f61eedd9a37d215e6a8a03ed1a; 66c137456f059c2d6ecd7110e29e56e307f3e960; 0186cda4af2416b27597ad57f983f2ec11b9d75b; 190b737e04df2cd233ea260fb9be002650550331; 9699fde85cbb26c8f5ec63be888e2f3bc722c2ab; 315d1eed34cc519b51904b19f899145d220736b8; c3e6c03109dd437ef2e3f47bcb32a40b76cd1ace; 93cac19f2b1a0cacb73914d4e9776f4b859ccf97; 145127270cac587a3f62a401244454c47e514d7d; fe2ae880d4cb5899ec68308803de458c99375a77; f55bac2b998da29070a054fd1621e02804eaff78; 8ed40b26ee48e0357bc38dced42323b6c0651cbb; 8d71fa6ab3cf7b4990824ca642f12ee55fb17e8b; 23fb0f63d8167e1f1e8d2bd5c025b723eec4a2e4; 283d417873bcac56b6a7ac9a50ac4a3d61b077af; 3b81308ebc5132ba4c002e3d509deafb90a155b3; 5b1ea4edf6e59d335ebff7cba28a5622456a23ea; 92ec2deaf6fed0981076429545b2810de2de3cde; 343e3c3570f14cd0689332cd7ab1410e5feb2d3f; ce80ecf806683239ff644b8f1c3cbf9ba45fd84f; 163b04e1d06105f4a660f723915c959c9b0040dd; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; ab50d8661b6575502b87582d157987fb4de83ba0; 3bd31202f6e5a62373b4744dc0e91535908bf8df; b5325b3db14b0f39efb8009864d78b8c51856004; c80f9d79715d6117046de3bd353e072844e8ed48,923212cffa329e43f5e0b0710724ddd880c67ef4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 20ee888ca9c3bae784f266405b4d6395c6f32955; 97a3dad39601246bb779eaecf178564d986cfe55; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 96604e6dc92b4094e743326476758283a4ab84b0; 7b4b6a3b9d19a1f57033d8642ca7b9ac97e94263; 500990957fb0f3a54914aff65413d76ae6e69d06; 3164599f45fe28f39fc7a01e9e66dd645b0b5f7e; da2300084e48bc67915193183c89167502122a9e; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; ebec069fd2cc0ef61ac3d30491e30243bd89a631; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; eba49f4e6256f44fb6a2fab5ee95519e9a9fb49f; bb92178d5133f9165b704500cbe2e5a1b2dab01d; 05ab43b91321e8cf57a42614dd630baecd110bd0; b8db0ca28c530dd0d0671af5d1a1c238a5a03fee; c29a73a978ed60fab2bc0a79e1129a47a7a3b6ed; 86a937b1a27aa5cc60e9c10c7c175bc0c8b46b2f; 7cd1619370c1ab9b68acbb05d91b6562c78ed8a8; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; c54ce87ca320f0dbc8dbd693572b4922a6f44b92; 91a95bf76f977328f95bf7e88ab7669ca29f96f1; ca93831e7b729bb12fca923bbb8fdde6135a5e71; 8d4ebefc1d0f7738a7c0db26a88eb4ea66ae45bd; ef5d4979a2234857084099bf3894901c331c330f; 9ae5d584339143d4d97bed0eff1978bb3761b9a5; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,Annals of Statistics,41,2948-2978

The positive false discovery rate has a very nice Bayesian interpretation (as it was shown by Storey, 2003) and its robustness is analyzed. The emphasis is on the Ïµ-contamination class (one of the most used classes of priors for Bayesian robustness) and it is shown that robustness is not obtained when the basic prior concentrates the probability on the null hypothesis.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""JuliÃ¡n de la Horra"", ids = ""10441289"")",40b356d0279a1ddd6aeb7a2b595bada19b95de2b,,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,36,1905 - 1914
a593b85e4ee87d504ec740000e6bcf87357a8e3d,Empirical Bayes Models for Multiple Probe Type Arrays at the Probe Level,"When analyzing microarray data a primary objective is often to find differentially expressed genes. With empirical Bayes and penalized t-tests the sample variances are adjusted towards a global estimate, producing more stable results compared to ordinary t-tests. However, for Affymetrix type data a clear dependency between variability and intensity-level generally exists, even for logged intensities, most clearly for data at the probe level but also for probe-set summarizes such as the MAS5 expression index. As a consequence, adjustment towards a global estimate results in an intensity-level dependent false discovery rate. We propose two new methods for finding differentially expressed genes, Probe level Locally moderated Weighted median-t (PLW) and Locally Moderated Weighted-t (LMW). Both methods use an empirical Bayes model taking the dependency between variability and intensity-level into account. A global covariance matrix is also used allowing for differing variances between arrays as well as array-to-array correlations. PLW is specially designed for Affymetrix type arrays (or other multiple-probe arrays). Instead of making inference on probe-set summaries, comparisons are made separately for each perfect-match probe and are then summarized into one score for the probe-set. The proposed methods are compared to 11 existing methods using five spike-in data sets. PLW has the most accurate ranking of regulated genes in four out of the five data sets, and LMW consistently performs better than all examined moderated t-tests when used on RMA expression indexes.

e7edad31fdd326a7223ebfc2b73db51b21d357f1,Genomic characterisation of small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation,"+ microRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNA molecules that function to guide the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) to regions of complementarity within mRNA transcripts, thereby mediating sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). This form of gene regulation is vital to a variety of biological processes in animals, from fundamental developmental functions including cellular proliferation and differentiation, to more complex and specialised roles such as longterm potentiation and synapse-specific modifications in neurons. While the complementarity of miRNA-mRNA interactions enables bioinformatic algorithms to predict potential target genes, the capacity for miRNA to interact with their targets through elements of only partial complementarity renders high false discovery rates to these predictions. With the discovery of increased cortical miRNA expression in schizophrenia, biological evidence was therefore required to investigate the function of schizophrenia-associated miRNA including miR-181b, miR-107, and members of the miR-15 and miR-17 families. Functional genomic techniques were established with genome-wide expression analysis and miRNA reporter-gene assays to characterise the biology of these miRNA in a variety of cellular contexts. In vitro characterisation of miR-181b revealed target gene regulation through interactions at both conserved and non-conserved MREs, with primary and secondary effects of miRNA modulation affecting many genes enriched within neurodevelopmental pathways vital to synaptic plasticity, including a number of schizophrenia candidate genes. Surprisingly, comparisons of miR-181b and miR-107 function against target prediction frameworks revealed a subset of predicted targets displaying positive correlation with cognate miRNA expression. Context-specific functional pleiotropy was also observed in different cellular environments, and this was further explored through miR-17/20a in T lymphocyte activation, and through miR-16 in cell cycle progression. Ultimately, substantial evidence was obtained to establish biological plausibility for miR-181b dysregulation as a potential aetiological factor in the development of schizophrenia, though the emergent theme of context-specific miRNA function requires future methodological developments and experiments to consider this functional pleiotropy when exploring miRNA function in normal developmental and pathophysiological states. _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________",2013,Engineering,"list(name = ""Adam J.

1565 

Introduction: In recent years, our research group has performed a number of experimental and computer studies that integrate different types of molecular data on the NCI-60, a diverse panel of human cancer cells from 9 tissues of origin. The NCI-60 panel has been used by the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the NCI to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity since 1990. Using Pearsonâ€™s correlation as a metric, we previously shed light on the mechanisms and potential medical uses of a number of anticancer agents, including L-asparaginase, oxaliplatin, â€˜MDR1-inverseâ€™ compounds, and the ellipticiniums. The present study improves on that type of analysis by computing a more robust multi-gene correlation metric between drug growth inhibition data and biologically associated groups of genes, such as those in Gene Ontology (GO) categories or those with common Protein Family (Pfam) domains. Methods: To quantify the strength of association between anticancer drug activity patterns and mRNA transcriptional profiles, we developed a new algorithm (SCIMS) based on a stratified correlation metric and shrunken scoring scheme, with statistical significance computed using a false discovery rate (FDR) which adjusts for multiple comparisons. First, we validated the approach on a synthetic dataset of 100 drugs and 2000 genes. Then, we applied it to Affymetrix U133A microarray profiles of the NCI-60 and DTP GI50 data for 118 drugs with putatively known mechanisms of action. Because the program is compute-intensive, we ran it on the NIHâ€™s Biowulf supercomputing cluster. Results: The results for the synthetic datasets showed >95% sensitivity and specificity for prediction of known associations. When applied to the NCI-60 cell line data, the SCIMS algorithm identified a number of robust associations that coincide with previously documented mechanisms of action, including a particularly strong one between the activity patterns of antifols and the â€˜DNA processingâ€™ GO category (FDR =.05). Conclusion: The results on the synthetic dataset suggest that the new algorithm is highly sensitive and specific, and the prediction of known mechanisms of action indicates utility of the algorithm for real data.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriel S.

The mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in MS are still poorly understood. However, due to the specific pathology of MS, one can expect alterations in connectivity leading to physical and cognitive impairment.


AIM
In this study we aimed at assessing connectivity differences in EEG between cognitively impaired (CI) and cognitively preserved (CP) MS patients. We also investigated the influence of the measures used to construct networks.


METHODS
We included 308 MS patients and divided them into two groups based on their cognitive score. Graph theoretical network analyses were conducted based on networks constructed using different connectivity measures, i.e. correlation, correlation in the frequency domain, coherence, partial correlation, the phase lag index and the imaginary part of coherency. The most commonly encountered network parameters were calculated and compared between the two groups using Wilcoxon's rank test. Clustering coefficients and path lengths were normalized to a randomized mean clustering coefficient and path length for each patient. False discovery rate was used to correct for the multiple comparisons and Cohen's d effect sizes are reported.


RESULTS
Coherence analysis suggests that theta and delta connectivity is significantly smaller in cognitively impaired patients. Small-worldness differences are found in networks based on correlation, theta and delta coherence and correlation in the frequency domain. Modularity was related to age but not to cognition.


CONCLUSION
Cognitive deterioration in MS is a symptom that seems to be caused by neural disconnections, probably the white matter tracts connecting both hemispheres, and leads to a wide range in network differences which can be assessed by applying GTA to EEG data. In the future, these results may lead to cheaper and more objective assessments of cognitive impairment in MS.",2014,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Jeroen Van Schependom"", ids = ""116312279""); list(name = ""Jeroen Gielen"", ids = ""38387745""); list(name = ""Jorne Laton"", ids = ""3240043""); list(name = ""Marie Beatrice D'hooghe"", ids = ""1397900396""); list(name = ""Jacques De Keyser"", ids = ""122639418""); list(name = ""Guy Nagels"", ids = ""2643251"")",1a3caf734228eb83ff2c2530d42108ab6a4cb56f; 5b940f73f74a4475951ebff1c589a8ac2568d695; baad30334b4082b28913a8f3657ebd2797470f41; 99f711c4133f5f15006d44cf527203cee997d6b9; 4800321df600bf5bbc9a5ae39c43ef83464a3667; 91933a317462e8f64123cab7318af882c8b6e5aa; ac2071071599c823d3a77a40e78a3309ddb3e3de; 207df2622279450de1254780a98dbaa1ba5660eb; 2e25abde00d19f84b49a9e7a0841497c9a9a4379; e07287daabe995eb249675d5f1d24e10e3a283a0; e7e21f459f4a8f1ebbc63755b1462c722129c26f; 9fed9be7f8cd3523d5a93246df642e2135a32ec3; 47d4644f61472402671fd2f739ace11804acbc46; b50b0fe10948e0d98e0d9eeb64deccbdbe868496; 944a688faab7fd386f5a1ea6696cb59ca6f4a34b; d078640ca66bbd57773ed41fa8e9e293f819426a; 30ea2dbed5e7d40de2535ff98870961aae86a7a0; a8aef6cf41feb4475b43a89e0f4bbc76f48f9cea; 39f0cc02f150012c3f0c487cacc674be90a5722c; 282a951eb4fc322f8551d79272f78ccd0cd78f9c; bfd17e00918c897fe1101348b4132326d0eab15f; cef523a72cbf022c80dc4e7536b1881e6210ed2c; cac3c81ab0dd009b9fdee30bd41995b3493a314e,a2b102708ab612867ad51ea56fa1920ca542fd22; defe01b6839f03eb754d83893ba167e952071d97; 363b0cf8ed6aa6c1e07a2b7925ee555d7e0ed1ab; 72634c447be14bee1cc10409e215d35acdb6e5c0; 59b61c9c2c6b950d6b909df52c08706a694abed7; 0d9b8aeaa1008788d8b232bd36de3dc359bbbfa6; fe9bd86613cf77b6288a4db66106e3c2d4433c13; 203d7329be92494f795038f7c43a0442e8a76f3a; d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e; b72f70346db2b0056db8fcd41f67e4fc37c123a5; db20da58d1b1924be38ddb68816bb214f5609a96; f48560964b99062fc0ace63a1c07f4249e3c78cc; d3d73fc36de456af3de79aa22a5f0b6f6303900b; b37aa198b97edc6cd6fe14ea660442a68e113836; bcd0786f8010dd8a24b5dd7951f6db5b39de819b; 8a8db07fae1d07826f3b0d959552453c8b4a55eb; 718a2b8d500a273d57626ba1762ab539beea6711; 251a39598dd4797b142684998901c64a69baa550; 2df8ed040445e0eccb9e2f1cdc2cd724aec68110; fae3819b8e90df66ae38cd669039c84ae232b9fe; cea5a009c9539f2d35ad94f32d58daca984ecbe5; c52fca7f866fc9aac412d38c694afcc8728f7d60; 20983b8a3ab571510697494d168f9685f5596245; d195ea3b6691c67f68d3282709f1072220b1c729; d4477f03d3da6c48d32e1456270b076af19b85ae; d4d2e45b514a35df2abe450f2d0ae278c5b2ec69; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b91c8e3e630f2cbfb4071aee54be970c38be1053; df2b798355c3a9368a9506ef794de0f80a53aed0; 84b79137d0ee63f409455ddbfa49ccb345ae0681; ee94504092bc3cd8ab5134c39e42e2e298cb2e8a; 55b9297c8dc34a6ccd20802dac44510750b9e9dc; 1a432dcd894d1e20e6f46d308e130009b536ca3d; b0473b0afa2ff98232a723e40e1c59a8a0293a82; 775ed4c9646a977260212270232ee609953fbbeb; f96f659ada20f35e9fce66306c8f8f6a471e592d; 75e573a6fd4f3fcf2151b5005aec3ef68e3a3ef3,NeuroImage : Clinical,4,403 - 410

Identifying the metabolic changes induced by PFAS exposure could enhance our understanding of biological pathways underlying PFAS toxicity.ObjectiveTo identify metabolic alterations associated with serum concentrations of four PFAS in children using a metabolome-wide association study.MethodsWe performed untargeted metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry, and separately quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) for 114 8-year old children from Cincinnati, OH. We evaluated associations between each serum PFAS concentration and 16,097 metabolic features using linear regression adjusted for child age, sex, and race with a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰20%. We annotated PFAS-associated metabolites and conducted pathway enrichment analyses.ResultsSerum PFAS concentrations were associated with metabolic features annotated primarily as lipids and dietary factors. Biological pathways associated with all four PFAS included arginine, proline, aspartate, asparagine, and butanoate metabolism.ConclusionsIn this cross-sectional study, childhood serum PFAS concentrations were correlated with metabolic pathways related to energy production and catabolism. Future studies should determine whether these pathways mediate associations between PFAS exposure and childhood cardiometabolic health.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Samantha L.

Using an enhanced analytical framework to integrate de novo and case-control rare variation, we identify 102 risk genes at a false discovery rate of 0.1 or less. Of these genes, 49 show higher frequencies of disruptive de novo variants in individuals ascertained to have severe neurodevelopmental delay, whereas 53 show higher frequencies in individuals ascertained to have ASD; comparing ASD cases with mutations in these groups reveals phenotypic differences. Expressed early in brain development, most risk genes have roles in regulation of gene expression or neuronal communication (i.e., mutations effect neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological changes), and 13 fall within loci recurrently hit by copy number variants.

115d6a95559c3ba06a87c1591623562fcb45813a,Hypoxic response contributes to altered gene expression and precapillary pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease.,"BACKGROUND
We postulated that the hypoxic response in sickle cell disease (SCD) contributes to altered gene expression and pulmonary hypertension, a complication associated with early mortality.


METHODS AND RESULTS
To identify genes regulated by the hypoxic response and not other effects of chronic anemia, we compared expression variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 subjects with SCD with hemoglobin SS genotype and 15 subjects with Chuvash polycythemia (VHL(R200W) homozygotes with constitutive upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors in the absence of anemia or hypoxia). At a 5% false discovery rate, 1040 genes exhibited >1.15-fold change in both conditions; 297 were upregulated and 743 downregulated including MAPK8 encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase important for apoptosis, T-cell differentiation, and inflammatory responses. Association mapping with a focus on local regulatory polymorphisms in 61 patients with SCD identified expression quantitative trait loci for 103 of these hypoxia response genes. In a University of Illinois SCD cohort, the A allele of a MAPK8 expression quantitative trait locus, rs10857560, was associated with precapillary pulmonary hypertension defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure â‰¥25 mm Hg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure â‰¤15 mm Hg at right heart catheterization (allele frequency, 0.66; odds ratio, 13.8; n=238). This association was confirmed in an independent Walk-Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension and Sickle Cell Disease With Sildenafil Therapy cohort (allele frequency, 0.65; odds ratio, 11.3; n=519). The homozygous AA genotype of rs10857560 was associated with decreased MAPK8 expression and present in all 14 of the identified precapillary pulmonary hypertension cases among the combined 757 patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates a prominent hypoxic transcription component in SCD and a MAPK8 expression quantitative trait locus associated with precapillary pulmonary hypertension.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xu Zhang"", ids = ""36422536""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""39878571""); list(name = ""Shwu-Fan Ma"", ids = ""83793745""); list(name = ""Ankit A.

Objective The aim of this study was to observe the gene expression of Actinomyces spp. in the microbiota of root surfaces with and without caries. Design The oral biofilms from exposed sound root surface (SRS; n=10) and active root caries (RC; n=30) samples were collected. The total bacterial RNA was extracted, and the mRNA was isolated. Samples with low RNA concentration were pooled, yielding a final sample size of SRS=10 and RC=9. Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were prepared and sequenced on an IlluminaÂ® HiSeq 2500 system. Sequence reads were mapped to eight Actinomyces genomes. Count data were normalized using DESeq2 to analyse differential gene expression applying the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (false discovery rate [FDR]<0.001). Results Actinomyces spp. had similar numbers of reads (Mann-Whitney U-test; p>0.05), except for Actinomyces OT178 (p=0.001) and Actinomyces gerencseriae (p=0.004), which had higher read counts in the SRS. Genes that code for stress proteins (clp, dnaK, and groEL), enzymes of glycolysis pathways (including enolase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), adhesion (Type-2 fimbrial and collagen-binding protein), and cell growth (EF-Tu) were highly â€“ but not differentially (p>0.001) â€“ expressed in both groups. Genes with the most significant upregulation in RC were those coding for hypothetical proteins and uracil DNA glycosylase (p=2.61E-17). The gene with the most significant upregulation in SRS was a peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein (log2FC=âˆ’6.00, FDR=2.37E-05). Conclusion There were similar levels of Actinomyces gene expression in both sound and carious root biofilms. These bacteria can be commensal in root surface sites but may be cariogenic due to survival mechanisms that allow them to exist in acid environments and to metabolize sugars, saving energy.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""NailÃª DamÃ©-Teixeira"", ids = ""1401021045""); list(name = ""Clarissa Cavalcanti Fatturi Parolo"", ids = ""5804363""); list(name = ""Marisa Maltz"", ids = ""2046610""); list(name = ""Aradhna Tugnait"", ids = ""3636866""); list(name = ""D A Devine"", ids = ""34932516""); list(name = ""Thuy Do"", ids = ""145642094"")",527a9e37c1e953c50b82109c1f5ed5a275d2fa6b; 5c1de93ed295d84b6275d000e19fb3f3b2380444; 1cd18bb1ddaea3b734a20927bded5d5345cf7c62; 288328131c978071c4b1892d7662f338924f42c7; ba60573246477081523d033e2ce17766fc278173; b84dff3c1cdccb7327efb671b3a600fdde7dbe1d; 83b091b866e0219ad7f162d840d2eb5397893d1b; 683193a19138a67342dabf4f5932012aa16cb3af; e62d5d5885ad3474fb84f7e6c7ddba23fe7bcd3d; 6126f29b21757db8ebaaf353f503e5d8bbfddd82; 817dff7333ab3c59b908ab3a4834db560ca5f8e0,6b09976d52c63719fb3c5727ca2f490dc1bb1203; 19efa1ef42a0b54c620b4c6e05f5d21651fc12d4; 78cc8c0e9dd83ac6f3085367c524242bd5e8bd83; 037cb085d9c348fc141e8af54648d9c0fabc038d; 562bd9cd9b1214e2b6bb31d19478659e4d3f8fb2; 7e4052c188045cccf85ce0c4a5f0e3888b91be08; 3e5a025b5293354aa166ead2bf1a98abd625839e; 2cd8427100200bd006dd3abc50feff9e75963870; 63305a85316db68c4f94a6e426539cecbe8e3ca2; fa728cc21b7f5a55ba258c10f1d0e375c9a17484; b84dff3c1cdccb7327efb671b3a600fdde7dbe1d; d3f68d7b7ae8fe43165c3ff209c7b61e9569a434; 19afac519174bca43785c836870c80e41e276434; 17ce7b0892b16a97f53d156d5322d6701cf804b0; b711fc97a345c4e7ecbc6c09ae71888e97be17d0; d8ce6c71732c0b826497a600c2fc7ec380e08362; 348d9dd90a0ce8393e58cb040fb4d09668589ff2; f8a91241b84c979a8edf6fe95d9d6014a3a92b10; cdcb76e184304e620592edd3bba132ed13757f15; aaa43133223e052a632afc9cb63ae7b8238ff376; 273239d6040f1d548763783cfe5668558cab8d5e; 0ed43f9f6301dfe2700bb57be436d3486e7d1d89; 96cf36405a7509348602731225538006e4a9221a; a9e25dad5abb234c6d50c06dbc36f84a5072942b; eee7c80e689211241813a42d923b306a5b927131; 59ea2561c80553420d37091cf9d07c6905288ebd; 31eed1f47e233bdcc26a0e5db26a2b50ca7b7625; 08c637250c5a98a75399a80f5485a9e822280c0a; 8c13cb826eefd9be33f8dfdaab3be4388b1bfbe8; 0e2a4fcf5f43a03bccc9ae77496e501028cae632; 26add7c2e60406c586b4f86824d384ab2cf2a77b; 3a0a93ecb059c63d25d6c1bca875e4c136fb2958; 6c540229c4cca2b391b83cbc3a661a68b23df7d3,Journal of Oral Microbiology,8,

We used fresh frozen samples from the Normal Breast Study (NBS), a hospital based study conducted between 2009 and 2013 at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Women undergoing breast surgery for reduction mammoplasty, prophylactic resection, or tumor resection donated samples of histologically normal-appearing breast tissue. Out of 474 enrolled participants 106 reported ever using hormone therapy, 37 of which had used it within one year of surgery (classified as current users) and 17 of which had used HT within 1-5 years prior to surgery (classified as recent users). Current and recent users were compared with 36 age frequency-matched controls that had never used HT. Frozen tissue DNA samples from these 90 women were evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Genome wide DNA methylation data was analyzed using the reference-free cell mixture method to test for associations between HT-use and the methylation level at each CpG site. In the model we adjusted for SVA derived surrogate variables, to control for unobserved confounders, and multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). Although methylation differences between current and never users were small in magnitude (Î² Citation Format: Sophia Harlid, Zongli Xu, Erin L. Kirk, Lauren E. Wilson, Melissa A. Troester, Jack A.

Acupuncture in humans can produce clinical effects via the central nervous system. However, the neural substrates of acupuncture's effects remain largely unknown.


RESULTS
We utilized functional MRI to investigate the topological efficiency of brain functional networks in eighteen healthy young adults who were scanned before and after acupuncture at the ST36 acupoints (ACUP) and its sham point (SHAM). Whole-brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding temporal correlations matrices of ninety brain regions, followed by a graph theory-based analysis. We showed that brain functional networks exhibited small-world attributes (high local and global efficiency) regardless of the order of acupuncture and stimulus points, a finding compatible with previous studies of brain functional networks. Furthermore, the brain networks had increased local efficiency after ACUP stimulation but there were no significant differences after SHAM, indicating a specificity of acupuncture point in coordinating local information flow over the whole brain. Moreover, significant (P<0.05, corrected by false discovery rate approach) effects of only acupuncture point were detected on nodal degree of the left hippocampus (higher nodal degree at ACUP as compared to SHAM). Using an uncorrected P<0.05, point-related effects were also observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal and occipital regions while stimulation-related effects in various brain regions of frontal, parietal and occipital cortex regions. In addition, we found that several limbic and subcortical brain regions exhibited point- and stimulation-related alterations in their regional homogeneity (P<0.05, uncorrected).


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that acupuncture modulates topological organization of whole-brain functional brain networks and the modulation has point specificity. These findings provide new insights into neuronal mechanism of acupuncture from the perspective of functional integration. Further studies would be interesting to apply network analysis approaches to study the effects of acupuncture treatments on brain disorders.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Liu"", ids = ""1724237""); list(name = ""Jun Tao Chen"", ids = ""3705983""); list(name = ""Jinhui Wang"", ids = ""38612176""); list(name = ""Xian Liu"", ids = ""39592771""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Duan"", ids = ""2557896""); list(name = ""Xiaojing Shang"", ids = ""48803391""); list(name = ""Yu Hong Long"", ids = ""47341780""); list(name = ""Zhiguang Chen"", ids = ""46842737""); list(name = ""Xiaofang Li"", ids = ""1703810""); list(name = ""Yan Huang"", ids = ""34881546""); list(name = ""Yong He"", ids = ""46968549"")",39843a743fc0ade0f262d2df5bd4920bf5e0758b; 3de1675c3633f07a7ec4dd59c179dd185c29737f; b366ca75ec56d14b230df4ba66de4f84e93f94ab; c2563191abb95a4e5f8224901eb25d8ff5650937; d4a5fa9df55e59f1390ba1760d1eb2f276aece26; a76f92021d5475bbbebd84807ff03b0b0b1db40d; 0fec7e17317aeab880e488853360b3873ce569de; 40d886e867cc8e6d48afd1cc28a016dec5aa8b58; 24d3ae1d43a9f699b3415ec38b9f4566bdecb67e; eee566a0d49ef07b58aa1dca03bed644cf93d29c; 209f7db3a79d8e811614f5f38833087c98b9b558; a5ab7761e600bd8364a6cd463ada92271e10c063; 54cb37a45dd862da450d6eb8e618df4d1ce444e6; cab11500e6489f7d332a4a14e14757baa998433a; 48c7ecb21abac05c337d6ae3cbf75bf513b3e5cb; 9dc0d7bbb36546435a9158f06fde2bbe3c4ec9f1; 4ca9212c581430f19f786b5022ab5018d5d32b45; 00daa981b320d4f6e8bd14b269b585645d5b6abc; 1844a34c3af8690bad1462ce36262403a62da9dc; e56cb7a2492de70e46fde39199e23a429323f992; 6f9c40d2178901fa8816c0814f069f2d46b32efb; aa13bc77888fca6fa7b9c055be55384856e68ef3,678b190a24957df86c06dc3a7f76fe1d021eee80; a745c6cf9b7aacc107eeb0173b5799793b00ce40; 656a098ea4842583363f6b46a8e0b164eaa919e7; c3aab481fcb1c84acafeb34215b7af09078cae3a; 8e69a0abd7877ad4e924fe99d6d1037bc2dc91d3; 0a042f1cbf3055053abc86f2e425463825eba83c; b976b550d4cb1134ef2a15d1b923ee12282737ed; fdb889c3bef339a026876ec05c589fe60bc88da3; 5450286f88458a86720149a2c61e52ae33701a9b; 69d71a4d5bf1035e3c13b473efb89cd7fde9b8d5; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; be0adfea42acc755693e8d95291997201bc6c248; b4bc236419099682174d3101791897aaf7fdc576; 978a7b8720c416672f8a607314f008c9d2f4a4db; 33625011888a2f86233a4e5bd07643ad6f7041b7; 873af2ddbd126938bb3eb9b01e8d5a13e052c8ac; 8311a4df3a7502b73c4faa2e7bf746d12c0dfd82; 80aa507aabba07dc6f3d9bc64d60273bc52e1c1f; b55dfb180030e51e280c5660e7351bbaee7d2d19; 8801326c2c24c82df7dce5cc8930e6406c165618; a8a18497987e8b4715cba7cd6d2f8e6a1d58b2fa; a7d9d266ba9e4b777d2cede0f1c5caf4d5e91d3b; 0cf3475e81020119debf41bcf56fdd2126b1f07d; fde3a1aaacc0cba6eddd445c1124b4878463354e; 1852257973cfcb729852a71c3d5ffe2b34270a91; d5a7b94196f932eea3656dac437e45cf72771dcf; 4f7d2f1a7eac5923d99fbe56fd3cced8dbe78e14; 4f4f2186c4beca24ebfd768fe04e721dde58375c; d6b6724ac6d7383b522d7ba40ebbbec20b9d285b; 6365c7e578b3ba30b85560515f8b7956a2a915cd; c246e3b2b5ff7295d816e1a65a7a25a0e8ee589c; 7a7971e33fe95a7e1efc776a447b09886f5cb188; cfe2ae8886119c7ddeb4e1917838b60ae15a0ee8; 9a92f31de6c10b2049ce09f172e1e7e36f17af79; 693a6e46be9b613ac5beab7313e1f0b51658dbe9; 9fdc2566c2603b1cd9f78421fadcd593fdfb407e; f2cfa9267156c269fee6817092b29e26418e0f0b; 101c9fc13ad251cd6dd888c32ce7e32bde628255; 409d0886811a7c645ece8dc8e95ce1bc0edff3b0; 1b87d889c143f23132ea748559f124b52fc06cb2; 78e9a58fdf66f8e21b4ec666d87f944974ca93b6; 435d9e7c9747fb54ae082f0e008e1be8fd861dc9; 657c7d64ca4c663c88176893b5f7a443d2f03dc2; e3e11eb2076e77572ff1bcaeaec2de252f30b2bb; d22b82c48b7aeac40073cb36862a50fac5825a57; 8c28caad5c4286e4cde8a73703ad5bc00c199d84; dc707c0f126e15da2142c2ee9242559e6177e2df; fea266aa7e9e039a9f419ad06dacc25abe13881a; b255af6c8076f3be49403a301bfd313f070332ce; 539b259e781a58f3a041ab7dc03ee9108ee37c75; cf1113fd0ba60d1c3a185a746b74be79cbb3680d; 966f10e9a805ae619732c4f2e0b2731a20eb5863; 685842433e6e1cd80d10daf2addb4c86a6fd9c31; c30eb67bf35c07cc7c5f72ad0240107357bf7d5c; 49768fb7280aec248809ec47594a4458888018a8; ec2c05eb854869f65a4838b6b130889318770c1c; 098755e7116d804df5ce87a509d131b558d86376; f393210901a1641e6e21fd5e59d3f2866c477816; c6309b2aa8706f69b70830ef18147c79be36ba50; a1f2f2d1bc1e62823bd60dcd0b0a5b6d9724de19; 817719074c802ae691be7c84cafc8a42a5d30e63; d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e; 395345271ac43bcd0ca29189d4edd32217631e5d; 905442f6c67619042615ff35ffce53b658d562d6; ce79b4f8e0fe9446b5b0ee5127bf188b51ba4aa8,PLoS ONE,7,

Introduction Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 100 RA-associated risk loci, whose enrichment for lymphocyte-specific enhancer elements is consistent with a regulatory function of many causal variants in these cells. Epigenetic modifications have also been strongly implicated in RA pathogenesis. Objectives To investigate the role of DNA methylation as a mediator of RA genetic risk. Methods CD4+ Tâ€‰lymphocyte-specific DNA and RNA were extracted from freshly isolated blood of 43 RA and 60 disease control patients, along with equivalent material from B-lymphocytes of 46 RA and 73 controls. Comparator groups were drug-naive and matched for age, sex, and acute phase response. Genotyping, gene expression and methylation profiling was carried out using Illumina chip array technology. After mapping genome-wide methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in cis ( trans mQTLs, highlighting RA-specific effects. Results CD4+ Tâ€‰lymphocyte cis -mQTLs co-localised with 30 independent (r2 cis -mQTLs in both cell types. CpG sites subject to cis effects at risk loci were depleted in regions associated with cell type-specific repressed chromatin marks, with enrichment at enhancer regions and those flanking transcription start sites, suggesting active roles in transcriptional regulation. Linear regression identified regulatory effects of these CpG sites on gene expression, and causal inference testing highlighted genes for which risk SNPs most likely modulate gene expression via CpG methylation. Such effects, robust to false discovery rate, were particularly prevalent in CD4+ T lymphocytes, for example implicating ANKRD55 , ORMDL3 , and FCRL3 as causal genes in this cell type. Our analysis of mQTLs acting in trans identified inter-chromosomal SNP-CpG associations, also revealing instances of differential effect size in RA patients and controls. Conclusions Here we highlight an important mechanism by which genetic variants may contribute to altered lymphocyte phenotype, and demonstrate the utility of DNA methylation profiling as a tool for the prioritization of candidate genes following GWAS studies in RA. The functional roles of highlighted genes in CD4+ T cells during RA pathogenesis await clarification.

54a8ec0287f9fd17846ffa52d9831aca9731ad04,Detection of quantitative trait loci affecting haematological traits in swine via genome scanning,"BackgroundHaematological traits, which consist of mainly three components: leukocyte traits, erythrocyte traits and platelet traits, play extremely important role in animal immune function and disease resistance. But knowledge of the genetic background controlling variability of these traits is very limited, especially in swine.ResultsIn the present study, 18 haematological traits (7 leukocyte traits, 7 erythrocyte traits and 4 platelet traits) were measured in a pig resource population consisting of 368 purebred piglets of three breeds (Landrace, Large White and Songliao Black Pig), after inoculation with the swine fever vaccine when the pigs were 21 days old. A whole-genome scan of QTL for these traits was performed using 206 microsatellite markers covering all 18 autosomes and the X chromosome. Using variance component analysis based on a linear mixed model and the false discovery rate (FDR) test, 35 QTL with FDR < 0.10 were identified: 3 for the leukocyte traits, 28 for the erythrocyte traits, and 4 for the platelet traits. Of the 35 QTL, 25 were significant at FDR < 0.05 level, including 9 significant at FDR < 0.01 level.ConclusionsVery few QTL were previously identified for hematological traits of pigs and never in purebred populations. Most of the QTL detected here, in particular the QTL for the platelet traits, have not been reported before.

fa3d7c5c9068d7101497a8b3d06563ffcd4f0794,Testing Jumps via False Discovery Rate Control,"Many recently developed nonparametric jump tests can be viewed as multiple hypothesis testing problems. For such multiple hypothesis tests, it is well known that controlling type I error often makes a large proportion of erroneous rejections, and such situation becomes even worse when the jump occurrence is a rare event. To obtain more reliable results, we aim to control the false discovery rate (FDR), an efficient compound error measure for erroneous rejections in multiple testing problems.

94dd893d856016e59622e7e9c4fc3b3e2923a36d,A powerful association for comorbidity analysis based on score based test,"Background In the studies of mental and behavioral disorders, comorbidity is an important issue since multiple correlated disorders are usually recorded to understand the etiology of substance dependence, which is imperative to the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies. Many studies have been reported the comorbidity between substance abuse disorders and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and major depression. In order to investigate the association between the comorbidity of complex diseases and genetic locus, it is critical to develop a computationally efficient and powerful multiple traits association test. Recently, taking the advantage of high throughput genomic data, lots of genetic variants have been identified for individual drug addiction based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Despite many successes, the current GWAS may be insufficient to detect genetic variants with moderate-to-small effect since a stringent significance threshold is used to control the false discovery rate, which is a key factor to the missing heritability problem. Materials and methods To detect novel genetic variants, joint analyzing correlated traits are promising solutions. First, joint analyzing correlated traits may increase the power in detecting genetic variants with moderate effects across multiple traits by exploiting the correlation between traits. Second, joint analysis can alleviate multiple comparison problems which incurred in analyzing individual trait separately. Comprehensive studies have been used to demonstrate that jointly testing correlated traits is more powerful than testing a single trait at a time. Therefore, it is important to consider the comorbidity of correlated traits in order to detect novel genetic loci in GWAS. We introduce a multiple traits association test based on least square. The proposed method only needs to specify the marginal distribution of multiple traits. We systematically investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple traits association test through simulation and comprehensive real data analysis. We demonstrated the advantage of multiple traits association test when multiple traits share common genetic variation. However, when multiple traits share no or weak common genetic variation, the multiple traits association test has no advantage.",2013,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhifa Liu"", ids = ""34788666"")",,,BMC Bioinformatics,14,A4 - A4

We hypothesized that gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls (HCs) and MS patients are associated with IL2RA SNP rs2104286 and that gene expression levels correlate with soluble CD25 (sCD25) concentrations â€“ that are affected by rs2104286. We used the Affymetrix Human Gene ST 1.0 microarray to analyze gene expression levels in PBMCs from 18 HCs and 51 MS patients. Plasma concentrations of sCD25 were measured by ELISA in all individuals. In HCs 266 genes correlated with sCD25 with Spearman's rho â‰¥ 0.707; 70 of these genes had a false discovery rate (FDR) value of q < 0.05. These genes were highest expressed in cells belonging to the innate immune system. Geneâ€networks were focused around NFKB1, TNF, BCL6 and STAT1. Eighteen genes correlated with sCD25 with rho â‰¥ 0.707 in relapsing remitting MS versus 33 in secondary progressive and 34 in primary progressive MS. None had a FDR < 0.05. Thirtyâ€eight and 23 genes were differentially expressed between rs2104286 genotypeâ€groups in MS patients and HCs respectively, however they were not significant after FDR correction. Our study indicates that rs2104286 influences gene expression in PBMCs in HCs as shown by the high correlations with the rs2104286â€affected sCD25 protein.

6ffbf42dd205f7b84f046d51ea97829f1f3149a4,The Gut Microbiota in Collagenous Colitis Shares Characteristics With Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Dysbiosis,"INTRODUCTION
In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an aberrant immune response to gut microbiota is important, but the role of the microbiota in collagenous colitis (CC) is largely unknown. We aimed to characterize the microbiota of patients with CC compared with that of healthy control and patients with IBD.


METHODS
Fecal samples were collected from patients with CC (n = 29), age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 29), patients with Crohn's disease (n = 32), and patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 32). Sequence data were obtained by 454 sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, and the obtained sequences were subsequently taxonomically classified.


RESULTS
Analysis of similarity statistics showed a segregation between patients with CC and healthy controls with increasing taxonomic resolution, becoming significant comparing operational taxonomic unit data (P = 0.006). CC had a lower abundance of 10 different taxa. Taxa-specific analyses revealed a consistent lower abundance of several operational taxonomic units belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family in patients with CC, q < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction. Loss of these taxa was seen in patients with CC with active disease and/or corticosteroid treatment only and resembled the findings in patients with IBD.


DISCUSSION
CC is associated with a specific fecal microbiome seen primarily in patients with active disease or ongoing corticosteroid treatment, whereas the microbiome of CC patients in remission resembled that of healthy controls. Notably, the shift in key taxa, including the Ruminococcaceae family, was also observed in IBD. There may be common mechanisms in the pathogenesis of CC and IBD.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Adam Carstens"", ids = ""144008413""); list(name = ""Johan Dicksved"", ids = ""5735500""); list(name = ""Ronald M.

f758caa4d9c44a87a6fe8a481dea0f17931b18e7,"2 Performance , Stock Selection and Market Timing of the German Equity Mutual Fund Industry 1","We investigate the performance of the German equity mutual fund industry over 20 years (monthly data 1990-2009) using the false discovery rate (FDR) to examine both model selection and performance measurement. When using the Fama-French three factor (3F) model (with no market timing) we find at most 0.5% of funds have truly positive alpha-performance and about 27% have truly negative-alpha performance. However, use of the FDR in model selection implies inclusion of market timing variables and this results in a large increase in truly positive alpha funds. However, when we use a measure of â€œtotalâ€ performance, which includes the contribution of both security selection (alpha) and market timing, we obtain results similar to the 3F model. These results are largely invariant to different sample periods, alternative factor models and to the performance of funds investing in German and non-German firms â€“ the latter casts doubt on the â€˜homebiasâ€™ hypothesis of superior performance in â€˜localâ€™ markets.

The copula method involves estimation of copula parameters and this was done using canonical likelihood estimation methods. We estimated false discovery rated (FDR) for each gene based on an unadjusted p-values calculated using permutation resampling approach. A gene was called significant if its FDR level was lower than some selected FDR threshold. We simulated data to evaluate the performance of copula method in estimating the false discovery rate. We showed that copula method can be applied to a microarray data to identify differentially expressed genes as it performs well in estimating false discovery rate. We also found out that copula underestimates the proportion of true null hypothesis in the study But the bias is very low. Relaxing parametric assumptions on microarray data may yield better gene signatures for melanoma.",2016,Biology; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Linda Chaba"", ids = ""10025572"")",,,,1,
a85c10076f3bdae67ea89e35a6fc051275635666,Reduced genetic influence on childhood obesity in small for gestational age children,"BackgroundChildren born small-for-gestational-age (SGA) are at increased risk of developing obesity and metabolic diseases later in life, a risk which is magnified if followed by accelerated postnatal growth. We investigated whether common gene variants associated with adult obesity were associated with increased postnatal growth, as measured by BMI z-score, in children born SGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative.MethodsA total of 37 candidate SNPs were genotyped on 547 European children (228 SGA and 319 AGA). Repeated measures of BMI (z-score) were used for assessing obesity status, and results were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate.ResultsSGA children had a lower BMI z-score than non-SGA children at assessment age 3.5, 7 and 11 years. We confirmed 27 variants within 14 obesity risk genes to be individually associated with increasing early childhood BMI, predominantly in those born AGA.ConclusionsGenetic risk variants are less important in influencing early childhood BMI in those born SGA than in those born AGA, suggesting that non-genetic or environmental factors may be more important in influencing childhood BMI in those born SGA.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dug Yeo Han"", ids = ""144455449""); list(name = ""Rinki Murphy"", ids = ""145470297""); list(name = ""Angharad R.

86d25b58e11be2f84f4929c2e797921c2cea2e0a,Quality control of single amino acid variations detected by tandem mass spectrometry.,"Study of single amino acid variations (SAVs) of proteins, resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms, is of great importance for understanding the relationships between genotype and phenotype. In mass spectrometry based shotgun proteomics, identification of peptides with SAVs often suffers from high error rates on the variant sites detected. These site errors are due to multiple reasons and can be confirmed by manual inspection or genomic sequencing. Here, we present a software tool, named SAVControl, for site-level quality control of variant peptide identifications. It mainly includes strict false discovery rate control of variant peptide identifications and variant site verification by unrestrictive mass shift relocalization. SAVControl was validated on three colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line datasets with genomic sequencing evidences and tested on a colorectal cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show that SAVControl can effectively remove false detections of SAVs.


SIGNIFICANCE
Protein sequence variations caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are single amino acid variations (SAVs). The investigation of SAVs may provide a chance for understanding the relationships between genotype and phenotype. Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics provides a large-scale way to detect SAVs. However, using the current analysis strategy to detect SAVs may lead to high rate of false positives. The SAVControl we present here is a computational workflow and software tool for site-level quality control of SAVs detected by MS. It accesses the confidence of detected variant sites by relocating the mass shift responsible for an SAV to search for alternative interpretations. In addition, it uses a strict false discovery rate control method for variant peptide identifications. The advantages of SAVControl were demonstrated on three colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line datasets and a colorectal cancer dataset. We believe that SAVControl will be a powerful tool for computational proteomics and proteogenomics.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xinpei Yi"", ids = ""51101724""); list(name = ""Bo Wang"", ids = ""144428328""); list(name = ""Zhiwu An"", ids = ""30935312""); list(name = ""Fuzhou Gong"", ids = ""50654631""); list(name = ""Jing Li"", ids = ""5289084""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817033"")",6726c162b4f4584114ad508ebfb14a3726ff2837; 0fb0d23df298f117cb864b0dbbc5a64d18643827,,Journal of proteomics,187,"

Methods: Myometrium was obtained from women with (n=19) and without labor (n=20). IlluminaÂ® HumanHT-12 microarrays were utilized. Moderated t-tests and false discovery rate adjustment of P-values were applied. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed for a select set of differentially expressed genes in a separate set of samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot were utilized to confirm differential protein production in a third sample set. Results: 1) Four hundred and seventy-one genes were differentially expressed; 2) gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment of 103 biological processes and 18 molecular functions including: a) inflammatory response; b) cytokine activity; and c) chemokine activity; 3) systems biology pathway analysis using signaling pathway impact analysis indicated six significant pathways: a) cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; b) Jak-STAT signaling; and c) complement and coagulation cascades; d) NOD-like receptor signaling pathway; e) systemic lupus erythematosus; and f) chemokine signaling pathway; 4) qRT-PCR confirmed over-expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2, heparin binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor, chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP1), leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, subfamily A member 5, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 6 (CXCL6/GCP2), nuclear factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor zeta, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and decreased expression of FK506 binding-protein 5 and aldehyde dehydrogenase in labor; 5) IL-6, CXCL6, CCL2 and SOCS3 protein expression was significantly higher in the term labor group compared to the term not in labor group. Conclusions: Myometrium of women in spontaneous labor at term is characterized by a stereotypic gene expression pattern consistent with over-expression of the inflammatory response and leukocyte chemotaxis.

7dd98052a1ed001e33997897637dc62ca2184cc3,Genome-wide Linkage and Regional Association Study of Obesity-related Phenotypes: The GenSalt study,"OBJECTIVE
To identify chromosomal regions harboring quantitative trait loci for waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI).


DESIGN AND METHODS
A genome-wide linkage scan and regional association study WC and BMI among 633 Chinese families was conducted.


RESULTS
A significant linkage signal for WC was observed at 22q13.31-22q13.33 in the overall analysis (LOD = 3.13). Follow-up association study of 22q13.31-13.33 revealed an association between the TBC1D22A gene marker rs16996195 and WC (false discovery rate [FDR]-Q < 0.05). In gender-stratified analysis, suggestive linkage signals were attained for WC at 2p24.3-2q12.2 and 22q13.33 among females (LOD = 2.54 and 2.15, respectively). Among males, 6q12-6q13 was suggestively linked to BMI (LOD = 2.03). Single marker association analyses at these regions identified male-specific relationships of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 2p24.3-2q12.2 (rs100955, rs13020676, rs13014034, rs12990515, rs17024325, and rs2192712) and five SNPs at 6q12-6q13 (rs7747318, rs7767301, rs12197115, rs12203049, and rs9454847) with the obesity-related phenotypes (all FDR-Q < 0.05). At chromosome 6q12-6q13, markers rs7755450 and rs11758293 predicted BMI in females (both FDR-Q < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Genomic regions on chromosomes 2, 6, and 22 which may harbor important obesity-susceptibility loci were described. Follow-up study of these regions revealed several novel variants associated with obesity related traits.

354185591e671dc297ca1f0d7e33660de0f09d04,Sampling strategy optimization to increase statistical power in landscape genomics: a simulation-based approach,"An increasing number of studies use landscape genomics to investigate local adaptation in wild and domestic populations. This method consists of simultaneously characterizing genetic and environmental variability across a landscape in order to depict how genotype frequencies are shaped by adaptive forces. The implementation of this approach requires the sampling phase to consider the complexity of environmental settings and the burden of logistic constraints. These aspects can have a major impact on reproducibility and costs but they are often underestimated in the literature dedicated to sampling strategies. In this study, we compute simulated genomic datasets on a real environmental setting and distinct demographic scenarios to reiterate landscape genomics experiments with distinct sampling strategies. The latter differ by design approaches (aiming at enhancing environmental and/or geographic representativeness), number of sampling locations and sample sizes. We then propose an analytical framework to evaluate the effect of these elements on statistical power and false discovery rates of the analysis. Our results highlight the importance of sample size in designing landscape genomic studies, where a minimal threshold of 200 individuals is required to detect at least part of the true positives. Furthermore, our results show that sampling at less than 10 sites clearly impairs statistical power, but also that the optimal number of sampling locations is not necessarily the highest possible. Last, we show that the designs that account for environmental representativeness result in the highest statistical power. Overall, this study provides valuable guidelines for optimizing sampling strategies in landscape genomics experiments.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Oliver Selmoni"", ids = ""7184909""); list(name = ""Elia Vajana"", ids = ""2269712""); list(name = ""StÃ©phane Joost"", ids = ""2436529"")",,,bioRxiv,,
12d7241314dad99b047661d507b02dfa80355ab9,Mitochondrial genes for heme-dependent respiratory chain complexes are up-regulated after depletion of Wolbachia from filarial nematodes.,"The filarial nematodes Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus cause elephantiasis or dermatitis and blindness resulting in severe morbidity. Annually, 1.3 billion people are at risk of infection. Targeting the essential Wolbachia endobacteria of filarial nematodes with doxycycline has proven to be an effective therapy resulting in a block in embryogenesis, worm development and macrofilaricidal effects. However, doxycycline is contraindicated for a large portion of the at risk population. To identify new targets for anti-wolbachial therapy, understanding the molecular basis of the Wolbachia-filaria symbiosis is required. Using the B. malayi microarray we identified differentially expressed genes in the rodent filaria Litomosoides sigmodontis after depletion of Wolbachia which might have a role in symbiosis. The microarray data were filtered for regulated genes with a false discovery rate <5% and a > or = 2-fold-change. Most of the genes were differentially expressed at day 36 of tetracycline treatment, when 99.8% of Wolbachia were depleted. Several classes of genes were affected, including genes for translation, transcription, folding/sorting of proteins, motility, structure and metabolic and signalling pathways. Quantitative PCR validated 60% of the genes found to be regulated in the microarray. A nuclear encoded heme-binding protein of the globin family was up-regulated upon loss of Wolbachia. Interestingly, mitochondrial encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes containing heme and riboflavin were also up-regulated. No change in the expression of these genes was seen in tetracycline treated Wolbachia-free Acanthocheilonema viteae. As Wolbachia synthesise heme and filaria do not, we hypothesise that without the endosymbionts no functional heme-containing enzymes can be formed, leading to loss of energy metabolism which then results in up-regulation of the mitochondrial encoded subunits in an attempt to correct the deviation from homeostasis. Our results support targeting the Wolbachia heme synthesis pathway for the discovery of new anti-filarial drugs.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Uta StrÃ¼bing"", ids = ""13850770""); list(name = ""Richard Lucius"", ids = ""6941419""); list(name = ""Achim Hoerauf"", ids = ""4441771""); list(name = ""Kenneth M Pfarr"", ids = ""3793496"")",301efa0b78941394586d08eb207d697f01106e36; ab1f36baab0675cec8ac7c868ae6128e13849024; c00167235dd84f54c4adc9a4773b098f94a7dff3; 85ecb1dedd27d6af5cddf338b27a5333e78f6e99; ff214d759ef587f0b7057deb6d5e365e82c414eb; fe40b3d7c28ccbae343ff50db7b3abe7af3bfee5; b4fc940a0d75a980b725e48023dc372c89e65ac2; 18695a79d5fd6862aa4cc0ec90321d9cf78fb5f3; 3bd691bdfe9135311915aeadbc112f1cabfa97e8; bc0e9e3b5e4a03b9e3773e2a8603b23a3f06ea2d; a4e2787f29c9665a9120681820a99f22112bc8fb; 044d0b855aa528fe0f544c055e7d8a6f6f4c4ef6; 693981de5bc0491d00b562c191ffdaf1535c8f4d; 4bc3b31f04340bbb9447eb0614ecfbd68948da71; 0ae8e2727b2175444a9dc64603b329428d354e46; 15410bacd83303f2882faf3bcb71ed8b733b5fd3; 9e57e4a21f47a8e26e223a949e9caa9eea0e5823; d48a7d74a984bb499ae2ef54c95b92e0555a402a; f295d5d31d702854ad59bbf68b8a1f94f5497baa; aa1df940b5968971687b4e4af9cead1a080eef17; a473342eee918077fde0d25d62157a1ab2a7adc9; 6479333443a69166229cd7bbbb46b3fd29b8d53d; 7de501308fe019c9a1fb781f42fc15130bc4c8cf; 675f5a7b090a4308456e29d0840f2b35d45098f7; c4e53806058bbc980494791fd32730603046509c; 777ecfc099c37770e8920aedac545670eb2c1d75; 8922031e8d36122befb022167d24f5e75252a765; 65064db30526aa70ea7c43a4b7540ef21bcf55ef; aba2e438dbc48ef5a707857ded5f92d02d906ab7; 451e287d82c96aae6a462183f5c3b5e35ded4912; 4f7a07c60b14bc7f11e73b04c0aef33fbbef0255; 7a9f3ef9ccf9fa81c87ece200890fb8557af253c; bd1058c502a70b2523eee7834fd512ec6357b1b3,,International journal for parasitology,40 10,"

5ee748d8247e73d6286b638ba0d063fef78177b4,Optimism Bias Correction in Omics Studies with Big Data: Assessment of Penalized Methods on Simulated Data.,"Big Data generated by omics technologies require simultaneous analyses of large numbers of variables. This leads to complex model selection and parameter estimates that show optimism bias. This study on simulated data sets examined optimism-bias correction by penalty regression methods in case-control studies that involve clinical and omics variables. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based methods (LASSO-penalized logistic regression, adaptive LASSO, and regularized LASSO for selection + ridge regression) were evaluated using power, the false positive rate (FPR), false discovery rate (FDR), and by estimated versus theoretical parameter comparisons. The ""ordinary"" LASSO overcorrects the optimism bias. The adaptive LASSO with LASSO estimation of the weights was unable to provide a sufficient correction. Importantly, the adaptive LASSO with ridge estimation of the weights showed the best parameter estimation. The regularized LASSO selection showed a slight optimism bias that decreased with the increase in the training set size. The optimism bias decreased with the increase of the number of variables selected among truly differentially expressed variables; however, power, FPR, and FDR were correlated. A compromise between model selection and estimation accuracy should be found. These results might prove useful because Big Data analyses are becoming commonplace in omics/multiomics studies in integrative biology, precision medicine, and planetary health.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yubing Zhao"", ids = ""21588701""); list(name = ""E.

539df2a572349bc3c05328a0ed23c046dc0229e2,QuTE: Decentralized multiple testing on sensor networks with false discovery rate control,"The field of distributed estimation, computation, testing and learning on graphs has witnessed large advances in theory and wide adoption in practice. However, there do not currently exist any methods for multiple hypothesis testing on graphs that are equipped with provable guarantees on error metrics like the false discovery rate (FDR). In this paper, we consider a novel but natural setting where distinct agents reside on the nodes of an undirected graph, and each agent possesses p-values corresponding to one or more hypotheses local to its node. Each agent must individually decide whether to reject one or more local hypotheses by only communicating with its neighbors, with the joint aim that the global FDR over the entire graph must be controlled at a predefined level. We propose a simple decentralized family of Query- Test-Exchange (QuTE) algorithms and prove that they can control FDR under independence or positive dependence of the p-values. Our algorithm reduces to the Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm when the graph is a star or a clique, and to the Bonferroni procedure when the graph has no edges. We study the power of our procedure using a simulation suite of different levels of connectivity and communication on a variety of graph structures, and also provide an illustrative real-world example.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Aaditya Ramdas"", ids = ""2556942""); list(name = ""Jianbo Chen"", ids = ""3111284""); list(name = ""Martin J.

Here we report the identification of somatic mutations for GBC in 57 tumor-normal pairs through a combination of exome sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing of cancer-related genes. The mutation pattern is defined by a dominant prevalence of C>T mutations at TCN sites. Genes with a significant frequency (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05) of non-silent mutations include TP53 (47.1%), KRAS (7.8%) and ERBB3 (11.8%). Moreover, ErbB signaling (including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4 and their downstream genes) is the most extensively mutated pathway, affecting 36.8% (21/57) of the GBC samples. Multivariate analyses further show that cases with ErbB pathway mutations have a worse outcome (P = 0.001). These findings provide insight into the somatic mutational landscape in GBC and highlight the key role of the ErbB signaling pathway in GBC pathogenesis.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maolan Li"", ids = ""123545649""); list(name = ""Zhou Zhang"", ids = ""1937454""); list(name = ""Xiaoguang Li"", ids = ""47058083""); list(name = ""Junyi Ye"", ids = ""6468843""); list(name = ""Xiang-song Wu"", ids = ""145720579""); list(name = ""Zhujun Tan"", ids = ""89304909""); list(name = ""Chang Zhen Liu"", ids = ""50557434""); list(name = ""Baiyong Shen"", ids = ""34782254""); list(name = ""Xu-an Wang"", ids = ""8415593""); list(name = ""Wenguang Wu"", ids = ""47203277""); list(name = ""Daizhan Zhou"", ids = ""49407860""); list(name = ""Di Zhang"", ids = ""2588058""); list(name = ""Ting Wang"", ids = ""40606844""); list(name = ""Bingya Liu"", ids = ""50677910""); list(name = ""Kai Qu"", ids = ""18116850""); list(name = ""Qichen Ding"", ids = ""40537636""); list(name = ""Hao Wei Weng"", ids = ""5137874""); list(name = ""Qian Ding"", ids = ""47510917""); list(name = ""Jiasheng Mu"", ids = ""5340006""); list(name = ""Yijun Shu"", ids = ""8067868""); list(name = ""Runfa Bao"", ids = ""7760703""); list(name = ""Yang Cao"", ids = ""13940019""); list(name = ""Peizhan Chen"", ids = ""7345840""); list(name = ""Tianyu Liu"", ids = ""1701889""); list(name = ""Lin Jiang"", ids = ""48931955""); list(name = ""Yunping Hu"", ids = ""1850579""); list(name = ""Ping Dong"", ids = ""144627966""); list(name = ""Jun Gu"", ids = ""144264965""); list(name = ""Wei Lu"", ids = ""143844117""); list(name = ""Weibin Shi"", ids = ""40268313""); list(name = ""Jianhua Lu"", ids = ""1694070""); list(name = ""Wei Gong"", ids = ""144529025""); list(name = ""Zhaohui Tang"", ids = ""144221422""); list(name = ""Yong Zhang"", ids = ""49889856""); list(name = ""Xuefeng Wang"", ids = ""38542487""); list(name = ""Y.

57b0659c67a819a50a1e289dc4e7ecac41b5f688,A Novel Screening Method to Identify Late-Stage Dementia Patients for Palliative Care Research and Practice.,"CONTEXT
Investigators need novel methods for timely identification of patients with serious illness to test or implement new palliative care models.


OBJECTIVES
The study's aim was to develop an electronic health record (EHR) phenotype to identify patients with late-stage dementia for a clinical trial of palliative care consultation.


METHODS
We developed a computerized method to identify patients with dementia on hospital admission. Within a data warehouse derived from the hospital's EHR, we used search terms of age, admission date, and ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes to create an EHR dementia phenotype, followed by brief medical record review to confirm late-stage dementia. We calculated positive predictive value, false discovery rate, and false negative rate of this novel screening method.


RESULTS
The EHR phenotype screening method had a positive predictive value of 76.3% for dementia patients and 24.5% for late-stage dementia patients; a false discovery rate of 23.7% for dementia patients and 75.5% for late-stage dementia patients compared to physician assessment. The sensitivity of this screening method was 59.7% to identify hospitalized patients with dementia. Daily screening-including confirmatory chart reviews-averaged 20Â minutes and was more feasible, efficient, and more complete than manual screening.


CONCLUSION
A novel method using an EHR phenotype plus brief medical record review is effective to identify hospitalized patients with late-stage dementia. In health care systems with similar clinical data warehouses, this method may be applied to serious illness populations to improve enrollment in clinical trials of palliative care or to facilitate access to palliative care services.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Natalie C.

Here we describe the extraction of a catalogue of beam-sized sources from a roughly 120deg2 region of the Galactic plane mapped uniformly (to an rms level of about 40 mJy), covering longitude 120â—¦ < l < 140â—¦ and latitude |b|< 2.9â—¦. We used a matched-filtering approach to increase the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in these noisy maps and tested the efficiency of our extraction procedure through estimates of the false discovery rate, as well as by adding artificial sources to the real images. The primary catalogue contains a total of 189 sources at 850Î¼m, down to a S/N threshold of approximately 4.6. Additionally, we list 136 sources detected down to SN 4.3, but recognise that as we go lower in S/N, the reliability of the catalogue rapidly diminishes. We perform follow-up observations of some of our lower significance sources through small targeted SCUBA-2 images, and list 265 sources detected in these maps down to SN 5. This illustrates the real power of SASSy: inspecting the shallow maps for regions of 850-Î¼m emission and then using deeper targeted images to efficiently find fainter sources. We also perform a comparison of the SASSy sources with the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources and the IRAS Point Source Catalogue, to determine which sources discovered in this field might be new, and hence potentially cold regions at an early stage of star formation.",2019,,"list(name = ""Will Nettke"", ids = ""102989843""); list(name = ""Douglas Scott"", ids = ""145817154""); list(name = ""Andy G.

In K. Ã— houghtonii (Crassulaceae), viviparous plantlets are formed on leaf margin notches in response to a long day photoperiod and their appearance follow a basipetal fashion. To identify genes involved in this process, suppression subtractive hybridisation libraries (SSH) were prepared. Two hundred c-DNA clones were classified and grouped into 14 functional categories according to Goldberg database (http://estdb.biology.ucla.edu/PcEST). Six hundred thirty sequences (200 SSH library, 48 database Kalanchoe genus, 382 other species database genes) were used as probes for microarray analysis according to the CombiMatrix technology and a 4x2K Custom Array â„¢ was synthesized. RNA was extracted from margin of leaves at 7 stages of development before buds emission (5 to 50 mm) during long-day photoperiod (permissive conditions). Three replications for each sample were prepared. From double strand cDNAs antisense RNAs (a RNA) were synthesized and amino-allil-UTP incorporated and coupled with Alexa Fluor Â® 647. Microarray was hybridized according to CombiMatrix protocol. Data were extracted with CombiMatrix Microarray Imager software and exported into Microsoft Excel for computing of mean, median and standard deviation. Person's correlation was computed and data normalized. After background removal, probes were reduced to 484. ""Fold change"" method (FC=2) was used to compare different levels of gene expression of samples.

5ad6e95e532e3198859b6df79bf82707015abf0e,Cardioprotective stress response in the human fetal heart.,"OBJECTIVE
We propose that the fetal heart is highly resilient to hypoxic stress. Our objective was to elucidate the human fetal gene expression profile in response to simulated ischemia and reperfusion to identify molecular targets that account for the innate cardioprotection exhibited by the fetal phenotype.


METHODS
Primary cultures of human fetal cardiac myocytes (gestational age, 15-20 weeks) were exposed to simulated ischemia and reperfusion in vitro by using a simulated ischemic buffer under anoxic conditions. Total RNA from treated and baseline cells were isolated, reverse transcribed, and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 and hybridized to a human cDNA microarray for expression analysis. This analysis revealed a highly significant (false discovery rate, <3%) suppression of interleukin 6 transcript levels during the reperfusion phase confirmed by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (0.25 +/- 0.11-fold). Interleukin 6 signaling during ischemia and reperfusion was assessed at the protein expression level by means of Western measurements of interleukin 6 receptor, the signaling subunit of the interleukin 6 receptor complex (gp130), and signal transducer of activated transcription 3. Posttranslational changes in the protein kinase B signaling pathway were determined on the basis of the phosphorylation status of protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. The effect of suppression of a prohypertrophic kinase, integrin-linked kinase, with short-interfering RNA was determined in an ischemia and reperfusion-stressed neonatal rat cardiac myocyte model. Endogenous secretion of interleukin 6 protein in culture supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.


RESULTS
Human fetal cardiac myocytes exhibited a significantly lower rate of apoptosis induction during ischemia and reperfusion and after exposure to staurosporine and recombinant interleukin 6 compared with that observed in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes ( P < .05 for all comparisons, analysis of variance). Exposure to exogenously added recombinant interleukin 6 increased the apoptotic rate in both rat and human fetal cardiac myocytes ( P < .05). Short-interfering RNA-mediated suppression of integrin-linked kinase, a prohypertrophy upstream kinase regulating protein kinase B and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta phosphorylation, was cytoprotective against ischemia and reperfusion-induced apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes ( P < .05).


CONCLUSIONS
Human fetal cardiac myocytes exhibit a uniquely adaptive transcriptional response to ischemia and reperfusion that is associated with an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. The stress-inducible fetal cardiac myocyte gene repertoire is a useful platform for identification of targets relevant to the mitigation of cardiac ischemic injury and highlights a novel avenue involving interleukin 6 modulation for preventing the cardiac myocyte injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""John Coles"", ids = ""144786441""); list(name = ""Cathy Boscarino"", ids = ""3104788""); list(name = ""Mark Takahashi"", ids = ""4642645""); list(name = ""Diane Grant"", ids = ""145364486""); list(name = ""Astra I.

c421bf623ec807f8327db9c72d9f5a2883abe985,Graph analysis of DTI-based connectome: decreased local efficiency of subcortical regions in PE patients with high sympathetic activity.,"INTRODUCTION
Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system was considered as one of the factors involved in the pathological mechanisms of premature ejaculation (PE). Sympathetic skin response of the penis (PSSR) was used to evaluate the activity of sympathetic innervations in the penis, which was controlled by the central nervous system (brain). Shorter PSSR was found in PE patients; however, little was known regarding the central neural mechanisms of PE patients with high sympathetic activity.


METHODS
PSSR of PE patients was evaluated, and diffusion tensor images ofÂ participants were collected. Graph theoretical analysis was employed to examine the differences of the topological properties of structural brain connectome between PE patients with high sympathetic activity and healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, the relationships between topological characteristics and clinical features in PE patients were also explored.


RESULTS
Decreased local efficacy was found in the left amygdala, right pallidum and thalamus in the white matter brain networks of PE when compared with HC (survived false discovery rate (FDR) correction). In addition, PE patients showed decreased global efficacy in the left amygdala and right rolandic operculum, supramarginal gyrus, heschl gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, pallidum and thalamus; however, these results did not survive FDR correction. Finally, the local efficacy of right thalamus had a positive correlation with the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores, while the local efficacy of left amygdala was negatively associated with the state score of the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and penile shaft sensory threshold.


CONCLUSION
The results highlighted the abnormal topological properties of structural brain connectome in PE with high sympathetic activity. We also suggested that the clinical features of PE were related to the abnormality of several brain regions involved in the central control of ejaculation and emotion. This study provided new insights into the central neural mechanisms of PE, which might offer biological markers for understanding the physiopathology of PE.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianhuai Chen"", ids = ""5022677""); list(name = ""Xinfei Huang"", ids = ""11350319""); list(name = ""C Lu"", ids = ""40939860""); list(name = ""Tao Liu"", ids = ""144018875""); list(name = ""Yutian Dai"", ids = ""81137793""); list(name = ""Zonghua Yao"", ids = ""151271094""); list(name = ""Yan Chen"", ids = ""50580325"")",,,Andrology,,
170efdb1b8f7deafbae0bcc2bae359d5bde07293,ProteinInferencer: Confident protein identification and multiple experiment comparison for large scale proteomics projects.,"Shotgun proteomics generates valuable information from large-scale and target protein characterizations, including protein expression, protein quantification, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein localization, and protein-protein interactions. Typically, peptides derived from proteolytic digestion, rather than intact proteins, are analyzed by mass spectrometers because peptides are more readily separated, ionized and fragmented. The amino acid sequences of peptides can be interpreted by matching the observed tandem mass spectra to theoretical spectra derived from a protein sequence database. Identified peptides serve as surrogates for their proteins and are often used to establish what proteins were present in the original mixture and to quantify protein abundance. Two major issues exist for assigning peptides to their originating protein. The first issue is maintaining a desired false discovery rate (FDR) when comparing or combining multiple large datasets generated by shotgun analysis and the second issue is properly assigning peptides to proteins when homologous proteins are present in the database. Herein we demonstrate a new computational tool, ProteinInferencer, which can be used for protein inference with both small- or large-scale data sets to produce a well-controlled protein FDR. In addition, ProteinInferencer introduces confidence scoring for individual proteins, which makes protein identifications evaluable.

231a4b701efb9db5368431484d2a417aca96943b,Mapping of brain acetylcholinesterase alterations in Lewy body disease by PETSYMBOLSYMBOL,"Objective:To characterize brain cholinergic deficits in Parkinson disease (PD), PD with dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Methods:Participants included 18 patients with PD, 21 patients with PDD/DLB, and 26 healthy controls. The PD group consisted of nine patients with early PD, each with a disease duration of less than 3 years, five of whom were de novo PD patients, and nine patients with advanced PD, each with a disease duration greater than or equal to 3 years. The PDD/DLB group consisted of 10 patients with PDD and 11 patients with DLB. All subjects underwent PET scans with N-[11C]-methyl-4-piperidyl acetate to measure brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Brain AChE activity levels were estimated voxel-by-voxel in a three-compartment analysis using the arterial input function, and compared among our subject groups through both voxel-based analysis using the statistical parametric mapping software SPM5 and volume-of-interest analysis. Results:Among patients with PD, AChE activity was significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex and especially in the medial occipital cortex (% reduction compared with the normal mean = âˆ’12%) (false discovery rateâ€“corrected p value <0.01). Patients with PDD/DLB, however, had even lower AChE activity in the cerebral cortex (% reduction = âˆ’27%) (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference between early PD and advanced PD groups or between DLB and PDD groups in the amount by which regional AChE activity in the brain was reduced. Conclusions:Brain cholinergic dysfunction occurs in the cerebral cortex, especially in the medial occipital cortex. It begins in early Parkinson disease, and is more widespread and profound in both Parkinson disease with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.

8b724d64aed27caa610b9fa970d7f1464c1a8b02,The Relationship between Change of Direction Tests in Elite Youth Soccer Players,"Change of direction (COD) is a performance-limiting factor in team sports. However, there are no exact definitions describing which physical abilities limit COD performance in soccer. Nevertheless, different COD tests are used or have been recommended as being equally effective in the professional practice of measuring COD performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between different COD tests, and to test the independence and generalizability of these COD tests in soccer. As such, 27 elite youth soccer players were randomly recruited and were tested in different COD tests (i.e., Illinois agility test (IAT), T agility test (TT), 505 agility test (505), Gewandtheitslauf (GewT), triangle test (Tri-t), and square test (SQT)). Bivariate Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between the COD tests. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control for the false discovery rate of the study at 0.05. This investigation calculated explained variances of 10% to 55% between performances in the different COD tests. This suggested that the tests covered different aspects or task-specific characteristics of the COD. Therefore, coaches and sport scientists should review and select different tests with a logical validity, based on the requirement profiles of the corresponding sport.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""BjÃ¶rn Kadlubowski"", ids = ""119881578""); list(name = ""Michael J.

acd594c8abe7d553ae71c42a4f89f8ed58b26cb9,Maternal Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Newborn DNA Methylation: Findings From the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics Consortium.,"OBJECTIVE
Maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been associated with adverse outcomes in the offspring. Growing evidence suggests that the epigenome may play a role, but most previous studies have been small and adjusted for few covariates. The current study meta-analyzed the association between maternal GDM and cord blood DNA methylation in the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Seven pregnancy cohorts (3,677 mother-newborn pairs [317 with GDM]) contributed results from epigenome-wide association studies, using DNA methylation data acquired by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Associations between GDM and DNA methylation were examined using robust linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Fixed-effects meta-analyses were performed using METAL. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by taking the intersection of results obtained using two regional approaches: comb-p and DMRcate.


RESULTS
Two DMRs were identified by both comb-p and DMRcate. Both regions were hypomethylated in newborns exposed to GDM in utero compared with control subjects. One DMR (chr 1: 248100345-248100614) was located in the OR2L13 promoter, and the other (chr 10: 135341870-135342620) was located in the gene body of CYP2E1. Individual CpG analyses did not reveal any differentially methylated loci based on a false discovery rate-adjusted P value threshold of 0.05.


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal GDM was associated with lower cord blood methylation levels within two regions, including the promoter of OR2L13, a gene associated with autism spectrum disorder, and the gene body of CYP2E1, which is upregulated in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Future studies are needed to understand whether these associations are causal and possible health consequences.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Caitlin G Howe"", ids = ""5531636""); list(name = ""Bianca Cox"", ids = ""2111208""); list(name = ""Ruby Fore"", ids = ""1405340818""); list(name = ""James Jungius"", ids = ""13068738""); list(name = ""Tuomas Kvist"", ids = ""1405209289""); list(name = ""Samantha Lent"", ids = ""34709333""); list(name = ""Harriet E Miles"", ids = ""1405118719""); list(name = ""Lucas A.

Mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) leads to systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure in clinical and laboratory settings. We investigated the lung structural, functional, and genomic response to mesenteric IRI with and without regional intraischemic hypothermia (RIH) in rodents and hypothesized that RIH would protect the lung and preferentially modulate the distant organ transcriptome under these conditions.


METHODS
Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham laparotomy or superior mesenteric artery occlusion (SMAO) for 60 minutes with or without RIH. Gut temperature was maintained at 15Â°-20Â°C during SMAO, and systemic normothermia (37Â°C) was maintained throughout the study period. At 6 or 24 hours, lung tissue was collected for (1) histology, (2) myeloperoxidase activity, (3) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentrations, (4) lung wet/dry ratios, and (5) total RNA isolation and hybridization to Illumina's Sentrix BeadChips (>22,000 probes) for gene expression profiling. Significantly affected genes (false discovery rate <5% and fold change â‰¥1.5) were linked to gene ontology (GO) terms using MAPPFinder, and hypothermia-suppressed genes were further analyzed with Pubmatrix.


RESULTS
Mesenteric IRI-induced lung injury, as evidenced by leukocyte trafficking, alveolar hemorrhage, and increased BAL protein and wet/dry ratios, and activated a proinflammatory lung transcriptome compared with sham. In contrast, rats treated with RIH exhibited lung histology, BAL protein, and wet/dry ratios similar to sham. At 6 hours, GO analysis identified 232 hypothermia-suppressed genes related to inflammation, innate immune response, and cell adhesion, and 33 hypothermia-activated genes related to lipid and amine metabolism and defense response. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validated select array changes in top hypothermia-suppressed genes lipocalin-2 (lcn-2) and chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1), prominent genes associated with neutrophil activation and trafficking.


CONCLUSIONS
Therapeutic hypothermia during SMAO provides distant organ protection and preferentially modulates the IRI-activated transcriptome in the rat lung. This study identifies potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets of mesenteric IRI and provides a platform for further mechanistic study of hypothermic protection at the cellular and subcellular level.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel J.

d807bfb63e4669d58c1fdd4a7819b8d86db33c7c,Inference and Experimental Design for the Discovery of Genetic Regulatory Structure through Experimental Interventions : Statistical Realism and Combinatorial Complexity,"Motivation. One strategy for understanding gene regulation involves the differential measurement of expression in wild type versus strains in which expression of specific genes has been suppressed or enhanced. Various proposals have been made for optimizing the information obtained from such experiments and for determining the most informative next experiment in a sequence. At issue is the correctness of these algorithms, the possibility of improved algorithms, and the combinatorial complexities involved. Results. We show that two proposed algorithms for determining regulatory networks from expression differences in wild and perturbed genomes are incorrect. We generalize and exploit the main idea of one of these procedures to present a correct, feasible algorithm for finding a set of informative, alternative networks to explain the data, but each alternative is possiblyâ€”and typicallyâ€”incomplete. We describe a correct but exponential algorithm for computing the possible extensions of these networks, consistent with the data, and a heuristic for choosing the next most informative experiment. Using data from systematic experiments perturbing the yeast genome, we illustrate these algorithms, and the False Discovery Rate procedure for making simultaneous decisions about significant differential expression of genes in pairs of experiments,. Our conclusions are largely negative: (i) the set of significant differences of expression are very sensitive to how the statistical tests are constructed; (ii) the set of alternative initial networks is very large; (iii) correct algorithms for finding all regulatory networks consistent with the data, and reasonable heuristics for computing the most informative next experiment, are infeasible in most realistic cases. Contact: ddanks@ai.uwf.edu 1. Problems with Current Methods. The development of techniques for the simultaneous measurement of mRNA transcripts from thousands of genes has prompted many proposals (Akutsu, 1998; Dâ€™hasseleer, 2000; Friedman, 2000; Hartemink, 2000) of statistical and machine learning methods to infer the network of regulatory relations among genes of a given species. Many of these techniques attempt to exploit, implicitly or explicitly, the conditional associations of measured gene expressions (that is, associations of expression levels of two genes when each of a set of other genes does not vary in expression) in repeated experimental trials. These covariational methods contrast with difference methods that measure expression in a â€œwild cell type,â€ and then experimentally enhance or suppress the expression of a particular gene or genes and measure which other genes have their expression altered (relative to the wild type) in consequence. Difference methods are essentially variants of standard causal inferences from experimental interventions and controls, supplemented with algorithms that attempt to extract maximal information from the data. There are general theoretical grounds (Chu, et al., 2002), as well as simulation results (Wimberly, et al., 2002) for doubting that algorithms of the covariational kind will be useful in unraveling regulatory structure from microarray measurements of mRNA hybridization. It is important, therefore, to investigate the optimization of inferences that can be made by difference methods, and the adequacy of the requisite statistical inferences to differences of means from small sample sizes with many variables. 2. The DBRF Method. Onami, et al. (2001) describe what they call the Difference-Based Regulation Finding (DBRF) method: Given measurements of n genes in k experiments in each of which one gene (or none â€“ i.e., the wild type) is enhanced or suppressed, form the directed graph whose nodes or vertices represent genes, and add a directed edge from vertex i to vertex j if and only if gene j changes in comparison with the wild-type strain when expression of gene i is experimentally suppressed or enhanced. Each directed edge is marked â€˜+â€™ if overexpression produces overexpression or if suppression produces suppression, and otherwise marked â€˜-â€™. (The graph produced by this process includes edges corresponding to indirect causal influences, e.g., if gene i affects gene j only through gene k, there is still an i j edge). Then, for each pair of vertices, i, j, consider the set of all paths from i to j (presumably acyclic paths; the authors do not say, but they explicitly allow cyclic graphs). Let the parity of each path be the ordinary sign of the product of signs over all directed edges in the path. Among all paths between i, j of the same parity, eliminate all of the paths except the longest. Because the DBRF algorithm keeps only the longest chains, it can only find the correct structure if all upregulatory (and, respectively, downregulatory) pathways from gene i to gene j are of the same length (i.e., involve the same number of intermediate genes), There is no biological evidence for such an assumption. Furthermore, the restriction to single knockouts amounts to an assumption, again without biological basis, that two or more genes cannot regulate a third through a disjunctive dependency, so that, for example, the third is upregulated by either of the two regulators. The authors suggest that their algorithm can be extended to multiple",2002,,"list(name = ""D.

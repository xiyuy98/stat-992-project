46c8bbbed8d1b9deb657f7a00862bd61cf7c4b05,Genomic profiling of intestinal T-cell receptor repertoires in inflammatory bowel disease,"Growing evidence shows that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from dysregulation of immune responses to gut microbes. T-cell receptors (TCRs) expressed on the T-cell surface play critical roles in discriminating pathogens from commensal intestinal microorganisms at the front line of the adaptive immune system. The breakdown of this interaction may trigger persistent inflammatory responses to gut bacteria, resulting in IBD. Taking advantage of high-throughput sequencing, we developed an integrated approach to dissect the intestinal TCR repertoires underlying IBD by collecting peripheral blood and inflamed intestine from the same set of 11 IBD cases. The intestinal TCR repertoires show lower clonotype diversity (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and stronger clonal expansion (pâ€‰<â€‰0.02) than those in the blood. This pattern becomes more profound in TCRs unique to the inflamed tissue compared with shared TCRs. Our approach further identified the increased usage of TRAV12-3 (false discovery rate, FDRâ€‰<â€‰5%), which biases its choices of J genes towards the reduction of TRAJ37 and TRAJ43 usage (FDRâ€‰<â€‰20%) in the inflamed intestine. Our genomic profiling suggests that this selective bias of V and J gene usage may lead to a loss of diversity in the intestinal TCR repertoires and result in mucosal inflammation in IBD.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Keerthana Saravanarajan"", ids = ""1491572402""); list(name = ""Atiyekeogbebe Rita Douglas"", ids = ""1491572774""); list(name = ""Mohd Syafiq Ismail"", ids = ""144715853""); list(name = ""Joseph A.

c2f5c503a8bca7d0440734d229c219050fc2813a,Genetic variants of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and reverse remodeling after cardiac resynchronization therapy.,"BACKGROUND
Reverse remodeling (RR) after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with favorable clinical outcomes in heart failure (HF). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is involved in the remodeling process.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We assessed the association between RR and 8 common RAAS gene variants, which were determined by TaqMan assays, in 156 outpatients with chronic HF. RR was defined as a >15% decrease in left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) at 9 (interquartile range 7-12) months after CRT. We matched 76 patients who did not show RR (RR-) to 80 RR+ control subjects by age, sex, HF etiology, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The frequency of the minor allele of the NR3C2 gene (rs5522 C/T), encoding the mineralocorticoid receptor, was higher in RR- than in RR (24/126 vs 10/150; P value after false discovery rate correction: <.0193). Conversely, LVESV decreased significantly less after CRT in carriers of the NR3C2 minor C allele (PÂ = .02). After adjustment for age, sex, NYHA functional class, previous myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and LVEF, RR- remained independently associated with NR3C2 C allele carriage (odds ratio 3.093, 95% confidence interval 1.253-7.632).


CONCLUSIONS
The association of RR- after CRT with a common polymorphism in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene involved in aldosterone signaling suggests a possible role for variants in RAAS genes in progressive LV function decline, despite apparently effective CRT.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Renata De Maria"", ids = ""113225977""); list(name = ""Maurizio E Landolina"", ids = ""6766633""); list(name = ""Maurizio Gasparini"", ids = ""3099158""); list(name = ""Boris Schmitz"", ids = ""40150306""); list(name = ""Jonica Campolo"", ids = ""3983260""); list(name = ""Marina Parolini"", ids = ""5469863""); list(name = ""Antonio Sanzo"", ids = ""6688757""); list(name = ""Paola Galimberti"", ids = ""4144714""); list(name = ""Michele Bianchi"", ids = ""39220950""); list(name = ""Stefan-Martin Brand"", ids = ""48035426""); list(name = ""Oberdan Parodi"", ids = ""134552645""); list(name = ""Maurizio Lunati"", ids = ""79745168"")",44a6ec18657118df4008ffad6c860ba403867a58; 7469a343c8293002c3ad0bdf4d8304b291563393; 3728a0311dc570b30614155edb5224cfbc6b3728; e0c72c42bfd656006bd8c88582feafdf3b3d908f,82b626f6ada9e432379884462450decf6d390dd5; 7de1cdf0ea31ee8b1bf1ebbb84de3a0d7e0dbd00; 026031a19f269b2d32bf02d85f2a16e75a7373c0; 508e15c598327635e993dbc78c4263fe780cefa0; 3991a142f2058f0c875c2a0e88ead9640de4b727; 17adaa30d6a628c9780b1240429d1dfb2149f103; 37cfa34d616b6b5356da638fbab94e9375929527; 9686ef85475fe30df2403a2a9e7aaf4eb1bf92bd; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; e8332eca874927b534a2d13209de4e2434250776; 27c3c438141c377a9072410e887d08d6d693c0fa; d83f47fe193c6efb823f18584dd30461259cb2d4; 8d56d7d0eb2b2ae2eaeccff6acb5a401d795d7af; e1893b7279d5314d3b67a866fe50635bc0fa617d; c6978ca09ccfb65bd8e22430c9fe725007ae4a60; 0d2b03e81ae02d6cecf6181a17bec7bf939a3781; 900d592b761b1532bf627485f37d6a927f3adf76; cad2058d8d8ce5d1635a0259d51b80be845f5232; fc07d62ee9263eabb36b7cc24d058b14599f5f39; 5d811d28783a3558e34f293f434ca09d7a3b78b5; a5e9ead66dd474017e77ece0053f5ef285c2b773; fb73fbf706bcb8dd567631239b77d6b743162db3; bb0f33d05addb6bc93e6e53f0cc37b28be47009a; 82a3c4c236dc5879467341a38101244f374509ac; e44fd2def34acf57b02eece593ad6ff12a21ace0; ecfd61da77967597f693a427019a22b20a18468b; 62f87fefbe062c0e43d10571131e010ddd710bf2; e47eca9c090528f046ba16fd0f640cd1f177a91a; 9039475148079d056f64d3c53abfc047bdeb082d,Journal of cardiac failure,18 10,"

Despite adequate antimicrobial treatment, tissue damage can ensue. We compared the human corneal transcriptional profile in late stage MK to normal corneal tissue to identify pathways involved in pathogenesis. Total RNA from MK tissue and normal cadaver corneas was used to determine transcriptome profiles with Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 beadchips. We performed differential expression and network analysis of genes in bacterial keratitis (BK) and fungal keratitis (FK) compared with control (C) samples. Results were validated by RTqPCR for 45 genes in an independent series of 183 MK patients. For the microarray transcriptome analysis, 27 samples were used: 12 controls, 7 BK culture positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), and 8 FK, culture positive for Fusarium sp. (n = 5), Aspergillus sp. (n = 2), or Lasiodiplodia sp. (n = 1). There were 185 unique differentially expressed genes in BK, 50 in FK, and 339 common to both [i.e., genes with fold-change (FC) < -4 or â‰¥4 and false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P < 0.05]. MMP9 had the highest FC in BK (91 FC, adj p = 3.64 E-12) and FK (FC 64, adj. p = 6.10 E-11), along with other MMPs (MMP1, MMP7, MMP10, MMP12), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, TNF), and PRRs (TLR2, TLR4). HIF1A and its induced genes were upregulated uniquely in BK. Immune/defense response and extracellular matrix terms were the most enriched Gene Ontology terms in both BK and FK. In the network analysis, chemokines were prominent for FK, and actin filament reorganization for BK. Microarray and RTqPCR results were highly correlated for the same samples tested with both assays, and with the larger RTqPCR series. In conclusion, we found a great deal of overlap in the gene expression profile of late stage BK and FK, however genes unique to fungal infection highlighted a corneal epithelial wound healing response and for bacterial infection the prominence of HIF1A-induced genes. These sets of genes may provide new targets for future research into therapeutic agents.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jaya Devi Chidambaram"", ids = ""2228898""); list(name = ""Shichina Kannambath"", ids = ""5304750""); list(name = ""Palepu Srikanthi"", ids = ""16310308""); list(name = ""Manisha Shah"", ids = ""50756909""); list(name = ""Prajna Lalitha"", ids = ""5192944""); list(name = ""Shanmugam Elakkiya"", ids = ""7538347""); list(name = ""Julien Bauer"", ids = ""48026683""); list(name = ""Namperumalsamy Venkatesh Prajna"", ids = ""8599252""); list(name = ""Martin J Holland"", ids = ""5054892""); list(name = ""Matthew J Burton"", ids = ""1801963"")",cf1666446a859482713e3051bcacd9c02a67832b; 65f2a8d7d51b52ff75aaa5639199ced1ed5e17b4; 16b8d340fbebcb8572cb95158b66027e7b987f8f; 52ecc97fd11cfe66baca968469c6753503b5cef6; 0b20e3b05b7f21616335071c99180abea7d67fa5; 2c1194efa1e7f6dd10ca7653c638994c79a1b7d6,3b79aae659a19d0e7ef85bd49c0a3df849e029f5; 2afca3021d8555c46463e0fb2db18362c8c27f57; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; e7148e7327e8445c736510c3681a999c6cf8203b; ba61c1779a0768c9f36f0d7666991d5cb7e0d7f1; feb0783d79663dc4e4fc554cb0c973ecacbd3b6b; d56b981091deb6286078833db6ca8729aaf0e6d2; 0b7d5f0d5829cac43d10916f04a4d90a722f3351; 2c55e232f1f7cf84e63d0d7ba56adf8fc5f697bf; de9eb5d29d5bfe97bbd36d73248153b2a89e63a2; c86cf4236fcff8be6bc45cedbf9ff2358f102a71; 30362393b67f9b2c6d45926e254b93e873f62139; 2fc8d1ce3315cbeab8bbb887397dfb73e47d0fc8; 437679f550ff1f72f82420cf8a23991c03547851; 48036a32a5de3f0a0633f4128e52057574696bde; 67fe220e8ae58362448a4650bb51b10a5dabeb45; 5163bfd2d08ac5e63c0a29fd61db1258b43dda3c; 984104e83a0f409ac1ddd926e39cdbfe3cdf417e; a6a8ba9f897942ba7a9f1ee2912a5ae00a274591; 7af92a93d2fa145133a2b99acf70b7c08a8b5e9b; 638a80a441b66032636da41385e4232d46e7742e; 1c4f76a06eef2b3e0b6f73ee785eca8c22b74c21; 4ccf6e0dd19612273320fe4cf7256ef8dfd94bfb; 1d090dc34efcf13212ee0654695dcac682eb3543; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 589d25a86b02d88a7502b48137f521b4905c3f51; f136237938251fecf532f658d1854860d02d28ff; dab02bcdb319ebcbfc0d1f56fc91ac919d748518; 92ca54540f8dd5cef8533ba38b230457dd6e7355; 523f5a954893b0176e1d2a6b63e08383a84eda71; bf49eb7b87621bafa681b391c56a48001de28a14; 0ac45946ddb220366fd27a2ab6f946c1c1ab07a4; 1b4064359d9d4363542241acd5e6da14be4acb79; 0332e6d39dffc81ad2286ba79ac639f2a2efed8e; 1702249c1e9c88dbdb0afe16659427dee8f5aac7; 1191b666428328931270bbae4d3927127b7f4041; 08c440dd91c91d1d7c16796bf5966169edc1064d; e4d7534ed038cb991d36ba62f44b66fc8a82bd4b; 4a1a06184d369c2ec529bc814da7d7cbf376d21a; 7828cb2adfcde841b39c68a19e32c59bc500dd41; 019ac4a693f834894be553e6fdb573ea2e1d6a04; d45f2b8f6819fc4c524794b3cfc0fa4c4f7d43f4; b0e7103accac3cc4337acdcd5653cd30946cdf7c; 54810420accc9141460e47aa8d2d1ae04189365f; dd1552dc5b73f74426c567849f48734d683deea4; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; c1470d1b6302f7a5bb0911ac40179d940e10b232; fabf2dce3f014911437a936cddcf65edb67387ab; 80f7ff601e478f19e906cb7384a479e5e4ca67bf,Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology,7,
16a61f6d5f60b2d644bb83c294fd5c9fdb7cfb9d,Comparative Proteomics of Unactivated and Activated Peripheral Blood Eosinophils,"Introduction Eosinophils play important roles in tissue homeostasis and the inflammation of allergic diseases such as asthma. Concomitant with extravasation into inflamed tissues, blood eosinophils are activated to undergo shape change and relocalization of surface receptors. A comprehensive knowledge of the eosinophil proteome, which to date has been limited to only a few hundred proteins, will be required to understand such activation. Here we report a draft map of the eosinophil proteome of unactivated peripheral blood eosinophils and characterize proteomic perturbations that develop upon acute activation by IL5, one of the major cytokines inducing migration of eosinophils into the lung in asthmatics. Methods For the global analysis of unactivated eosinophils, blood eosinophils purified from three individuals were combined, lysed by probe sonication, digested with trypsin, and desalted. The sample was enriched for phosphorylation using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The enriched and non-enriched samples were pre-fractionated using high pH reversed-phase chromatography. The fractions were analyzed on a nanoLC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Scientific). MaxQuant was used to search, filter to 1% false discovery rate (FDR), and provide label free quantitation. Phosphorylation sites were localized with the PhosphoRS algorithm. For the comparison between activated and unactivated cells, eosinophils were purified from five different volunteers. After purification, each preparation was split in half, one half was incubated with IL5 for 5 minutes and the other was left unperturbed. The ten samples were individually lysed, digested, desalted, and tagged using 10-plex Tandem Mass Tags (TMT, Thermo Scientific). The tagged samples were recombined in equal amounts and analyzed as described above except the resolution was increased for the MS2 scan to allow quantification of the reporter ions from the fragmented mass tags. The software suite COMPASS (Coon OMSSA Proteomic Analysis Software Suite) was used to analyze the data and supplemented with localization of the phosphorylation data using PhosphoRS (Thermo Scientific). Results An optimized sample preparation workflow coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry probed new depths of the eosinophil proteome. We identified over 100,000 unique peptides that mapped to 6,899 unique proteins. From these data we estimate the absolute abundance of 6,855 of these proteins through intensity based absolute quantification (iBAQ). Five of the 11 most abundant proteins are stored in the granules that are characteristic of eosinophils. From the IMAC-enriched samples, 5,336 sites of phosphorylation were localized. The combined protein and phosphorylation data provide unparalleled coverage of the eosinophil proteome. To identify biological significant sites of regulatory phosphorylation we used isobaric labeling to compare the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of unactivated and IL5-activated eosinophils. The TMT reagent allowed comparison of all ten samples (five from each condition) simultaneously. Here we report the largest quantitative proteomic comparison of eosinophils to date with the quantification of 4,447 proteins and localization of 2,068 sites of phosphorylation. Acute activation resulted in a 2-fold change in the abundance of only 5 of the 4,447 proteins (p-value of less than 0.05 from Studentâ€™s t-test with Bonferroni correction). Of identified phosphosites, however, 150 were significantly changed between the two conditions, and 20 were unique to the activated state. We are currently in the process of validating and interpreting the phosphorylation data as well as assessing significance of changes across multiple pathways. Variation among individuals will also be explored further using the current data set. These experiments should provide a solid basis for using comparative proteomics to study activation of other hematopoietic cells and variability in individual responses.

The Use of High-density Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Panels in Hereford Beef Cattle: Genotype Reconstruction and Identification of Genome Patterns Related to Selection. (Under the direction of Joseph P. Cassady and Christian Maltecca). The overall objective of this study was to apply single nucleotide polymorphism panels on Hereford beef cattle to reconstruct genotypes and identify genome patterns related to selection. Individuals were sampled from a closed population known as the Line 1 Hereford (L1) and general American Hereford population (AHA). Genotypes of 50,562 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were collected from 240 L1 animals (born from 1953 to 2008), including 57 cows and 183 bulls, and 311 AHA bulls (born from 1970 to 2007). Different quantity controls were applied on SNPs to fit the nature of the studies. To study genotype reconstruction, subsets of animals were utilized as reference samples (N = 62 to 311) for which 39,497 SNPs were known, and subsets of animals were employed as study samples (N = 57 or 62) where genotypes were available for ~2,600 SNPs (reduced panels). Both linkage among animals and linkage disequilibrium (LD), the non-random association among SNPs, were employed to reconstruct masked genotypes. This procedure is known as an imputation process with its accuracy measured as the correlation between imputed genotypes and real genotypes. Reduced panel design incorporated with even spacing and highly polymorphic SNPs, larger reference sample size, diversified reference origin from AHA and higher genetic relationship among animals in the reference and study samples all increased imputation accuracy (P-values < 0.001). A 0.1 increase in average genetic relationship among animals in the reference and study samples that were estimated by pedigree or SNPs resulted in a 30.44 or 23.19% increase in imputation accuracy, respectively. Based on SNP genotypes, genome patterns of L1 and AHA were also identified. Linkage disequilibrium within breed indicated that non-random association between SNPs was higher in L1 than that in AHA. Correlations of LD across breeds confirmed the recent divergence of these two populations. Fixation index (Fst) estimated with all SNPs was 0.08, revealing small general divergence between these two populations. However, strong local divergence signals were detected in some regions of the genome using Fst estimated by nonoverlapping sliding windows of six SNPs. Window heterozygosity (Hw) was calculated for L1, AHA and a combination of both to reveal genome regions that approached fixation or conversely had high percentage of heterozygotes. The lowest 2.5% Hw values were 0.05, 0.12 and 0.10, while the highest 2.5% Hw values were 0.45, 0.44 and 0.43, respectively. Putative directional selection signatures were detected in genome regions of low Hw found in all three groups of samples. Low Hw regions co-located with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for growth traits. If SNPs of interest are less than 20 SNPs apart they were clustered into single regions. Low Hw regions only found on L1 may reflect fixation driven by random drift effects. High Hw would suggest stabilizing selection and high Hw regions co-located with QTL related to fitness support this hypothesis. Furthermore, SNP genotypes were regressed on cumulative selection differentials (CSD) for postweaning gain in L1. When CSD increased, 1,082 SNPs significantly changed their allele frequencies (False discovery rate < 0.05). Three regions containing significant SNPs for CSD regression also had high Hw, and were found to co-locate with known QTL for growth related traits. Regressing heterozygosity of SNPs to the non-additive portion of postweaning gain variance resulted in the detection of 60 significant SNPs (FDR < 0.20). Of these, three regions co-located with QTL for reproductive traits, possibly outlining stabilizing selection phenomena. It was concluded that imputation accuracy can be increased through optimization of reduced panel design and genotyping strategies. With high density SNP panels, genomic patterns can be utilized to detect genome regions related to selection.",2011,Biology,"list(name = ""Yijian Huang"", ids = ""49866077"")",,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 70e52f7e3d0f09ede0291a0e0670094e917ff81c; 06778d3e840c40cd65d41e5096d3156febcb5311; bd09a4073863b7e0c3d8f4eb9d3113fdf45b0fc6; 0c7fff9cf4347c6d870cc19131b52628fe483094; c9529c81ecc991d3e3105123b78d311020d0efc7; 77f2e1beab20d43ee5ec027056687ea8609ef577; 95cc35eb34d9564e2996a3fba7925ef9bb9467fd; aa2ff9734dfe18463cb52628c24108987c127839; 4d959fce6817d2eb7a60b8568bbe52235854ca3b; 9648b5a1e0047e3f6a23e875283961357ff5cfc6; 65fc420669469fab694bc5a384219d905b4886b5; cd4a03e4709b4343d01b4717307b95978cd48be0; 6d203d4c7f57cc05a1c867a1c4cffd3b6fc120dd; daac160c21fb08bab3976ad3bdca9a0d97c8ebe7; 11fbbc674ccb879f0dce797f9b5beb15ddae1722; 7eb1269e0c40663bbdb7a80f60b2018b21db8561; a8a6adc956a05acfe76cd43c6d30347919ca1722; 6ae3450e6c10d94298bfb1f5a61125f997bf4c26; 12acccbe57e89381a34532a583d4f845c97f7578; 93825abdd333cea7105201c068c6e6b50f6028d7; c28c40dd86dc1847cb6b4999c3c1e10437f489a7; 4e34b8a29b0536d884041dc7fca36078df110b4f; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; 93e213e8070baac1a9e3cc3116d6c64a9b984bc1; 6126379e9ffbf088fc5cf838ba53a9b95526d0d5; 67f8b92e60bb34031a8bac7edb45bdd740d52436; 5d6637132a0108501085b4ce37ea2f9816ddf419; c83764cd4e81bf373845345f42f4f8b90b6b5a1c; a4286bc99a3c2db34ab4ee71b2719e09e29a1477; 26500a7cc76cf1fc09ebdb40bb8505a9276bdc46; c42c1891cd7e0283f7c5f061e50bb85c7dc2aa6e; c221a357ab635b58c2f10abbc0781181d88b9fba; 4e0127b4ba54ada429d55979df1227d6de9e146d; fe5df45f5349aa1d400b685492954f5c5572e57d; 752c1df5cb232d619917f4615b6e65d8d0a0afd8; 25975b2d1c1b6cebeea8658f35b44117bfbe887d; 6851b8fc7b5d288ad186e2dcc832d679d99d2f21; 4b57f4f7516dd8003f179575257cd056f7dd3fd6; 9f0f5ea38977e81e44cb0ac76c6cc1f3afa7b7aa; 62c8bb218ad2f4dda766b3349b0185e3ee4ec2cd; 3a3c4e6e54ce144a589078d78ba32ac93285bfb5; af12a7b135a74057b014792e0f85bb7d4c2f9397,,,
9dde2eec6d73eeb45b1fe24418ac572d92896f62,Meta-Analysis Identifies NF-ÎºB as a Therapeutic Target in Renal Cancer,"OBJECTIVE
To determine the expression patterns of NF-ÎºB regulators and target genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), their correlation with von Hippel Lindau (VHL) mutational status, and their association with survival outcomes.


METHODS
Meta-analyses were carried out on published ccRCC gene expression datasets by RankProd, a non-parametric statistical method. DEGs with a False Discovery Rate of < 0.05 by this method were considered significant, and intersected with a curated list of NF-ÎºB regulators and targets to determine the nature and extent of NF-ÎºB deregulation in ccRCC.


RESULTS
A highly-disproportionate fraction (~40%; p < 0.001) of NF-ÎºB regulators and target genes were found to be up-regulated in ccRCC, indicative of elevated NF-ÎºB activity in this cancer. A subset of these genes, comprising a key NF-ÎºB regulator (IKBKB) and established mediators of the NF-ÎºB cell-survival and pro-inflammatory responses (MMP9, PSMB9, and SOD2), correlated with higher relative risk, poorer prognosis, and reduced overall patient survival. Surprisingly, levels of several interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and interferon target genes were also elevated in ccRCC, indicating that an 'interferon signature' may represent a novel feature of this disease. Loss of VHL gene expression correlated strongly with the appearance of NF-ÎºB- and interferon gene signatures in both familial and sporadic cases of ccRCC. As NF-ÎºB controls expression of key interferon signaling nodes, our results suggest a causal link between VHL loss, elevated NF-ÎºB activity, and the appearance of an interferon signature during ccRCC tumorigenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings identify NF-ÎºB and interferon signatures as clinical features of ccRCC, provide strong rationale for the incorporation of NF-ÎºB inhibitors and/or and the exploitation of interferon signaling in the treatment of ccRCC, and supply new NF-ÎºB targets for potential therapeutic intervention in this currently-incurable malignancy.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Suraj Peri"", ids = ""50551907""); list(name = ""Karthik Devarajan"", ids = ""46415818""); list(name = ""Dong-hua Yang"", ids = ""2721775""); list(name = ""Alfred G.

b2569db0a43d9103a5a5746f7ed0cc90e604d79a,Genetic Variants in the Natriuretic Peptide Pathway Predict Protein Expression,"Background: Natriuretic peptides (NP) such as BNP represent a critical physiologic pathway in heart failure, and have important therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, there is wide variability in system functioning, which may be genetic in origin. We previously showed that genetic variation correlates to RNA quantity in key NP pathway genes, but whether genotype is associated with altered protein expression is unknown.Methods: DNA and tissue samples from non-tumor human kidney (n577) were obtained. Kidney was chosen as target tissue because each of the four candidate genes and proteins (natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR1), NPR2, NPR3 and membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME)) are expressed there. DNA samples were genotyped for 120 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in these four genes using a custom Illumina Goldengate array. Target protein concentration was determined in tissue lysates using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for each target. We tested the association of individual SNPs with protein expression using ANOVA, and used a principal components (PC) based regression method for overall SNP association (within each gene) with protein quantity. P-values !0.05 were considered of interest. Multiple comparisons were accounted for by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05. Results: NPR2 showed substantial linkage disequilibrium, and 11 SNPs were associated with protein expression (p!0.05, Figure). These remained significant when FDR was controlled at 0.05. One SNP in MME had a crude association with protein expression (rs3773895, p!0.05) but this did not meet FDR significance. There were no associations of NPR1 or NPR3 genotypes with protein expression. The principle components analysis showed similar results, with PC1 of NPR2 being the only significant association with protein expression. Conclusion: These data suggest that genetic variation in NPR2 impacts protein expression in kidney. Further study is needed to assess whether genetic variation in NPR2 influences NP system physiology, or the effect of exogenous NPs.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bipin Sunkara"", ids = ""11261006""); list(name = ""Sharad Rastogi"", ids = ""16245373""); list(name = ""John K-J.

First Episode Psychosis Patients across Europe Differ in Intellectual Quotient (iq) and Exposure to Environmental Hazards,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference Oral Session: Cognition S75 50 Î¼g from each sample were reduced, alkylated, tryptically digested, then zip-tipped to concentrate and purify. Samples were then run for a 90-min gradient on a Thermo Scientific QExactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. Raw MS data were processed by MaxQuant software and searched against the human Uniprot database, for label free quantitation of peptides and proteins. False discovery rates (FDR) were set at 1% for both peptide and protein levels in target/decoy to minimize false positives. The match between runs feature was utilized. Results: Four hundred and sixty-four protein identifications were obtained. Samples were excluded where >30% of proteins were missing, and we used imputation, where the missingness depends upon a threshold of detection. This left 228 proteins for analysis. Of these, 21 were significantly different between responders and non-responders (p<0.05), one was FDR positive, one at trend FDR level. Pathway analysis (KEGG, David NIH) of the significant proteins determined â€œcomplement and coagulation cascadesâ€ to be the top pathway affected with six proteins from the list assigned to the pathway. These were CFI, C4A, C6, F9, VWF and SERPING1, all found to be up-regulated and with p-values ranging from 0.002 to 0.044. C6 is a constituent of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that plays a key role in the innate and adaptive immune response, while CFI belongs to the alternative pathway, C4A belongs to the classical pathway and F9 and VWF play roles in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Discussion: These data complement results by Sekar et  al., implicating excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia. Our data identifies the complement proteins in treatment response and this is also consistent with our previous findings of up-regulation of the complement pathway among those at risk of future psychotic experiences. O1.8. STRESS-INDUCED AMYGDALA HYPERACTIVITY LEADS TO INTERNEURON LOSS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE PATHOLOGY IN A DEVELOPMENTAL DISRUPTION MODEL OF SCHIZOPHRENIA Anthony Grace*,1, Felipe Gomes1, Xiyu Zhu1 1University of Pittsburgh Background: Studies of the MAM rat model of schizophrenia show that rats exhibit higher anxiety levels, greater response to stress, and amygdala hyperactivity prepubertally before the emergence of the hyperdopaminergic state later in life. Furthermore, administration of diazepam prepubertally prevents this transition. These data suggest that MAM may predispose to psychosis via increased response to environmental stressors. If this is accurate, then one would predict that sufficiently strong stressors administered to normal rats during the critical period prepubertally would lead to psychosis-like state in the adult. Methods: Rats are exposed to either 3 sessions of 1-hour restraint, 25 footshocks daily for 10  days, or both stressors delivered either at PD 31â€“40 (prepuberty) or PD 65â€“74 (adult) in intact rats and rats with prelimbic PFC (plPFC) lesions at PD25. Rats were tested for amphetamine locomotion, novel object recognition (NOR), and VTA DA neuron firing. Valproic acid (VPA) was administered to adults 5 days before and during the combined stressors to reopen the critical period. DREADD activation of the amygdala was also evaluated. Results: While individual stressors prepubertally augmented anxiety and disrupted NOR in the adult, only the combined stressors resulted in amphetamine hyperlocomotion and increased DA neuron population activity similar to the MAM rats. plPFC lesions enabled the footshock alone to lead to anxiety, NOR deficits, and the hyperdopaminergic state in the adult. Given that stress is known to impact parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the hippocampus when administered during the critical period in prepubertal rats, we tested the impact of opening the critical period in the adult rats with VPA. Normal rats given combined stressors at PD 65â€“74 showed attenuated DA neuron activity similar to that observed in depression models. However, administration of VPA caused the combined stressors to lead to the schizophrenia phenotype. This was accompanied by hippocampal hyperactivity driven by an overactive amygdala, since DREADD activation of the amygdala produced similar effects. Discussion: These data suggest that factors that increase the response to environmental stressors during the prepubertal critical period lead to activation of the stress-activated amygdala-hippocampal pathway and PV interneuron loss, which leads to the hyperdopaminergic state in the adult thought to underlie psychosis. Furthermore, re-opening the critical period in the adult makes the adult sensitive to stress-induced psychosis. This suggests that controlling the impact of stress early in life in susceptible individuals may be an effective means to circumvent the transition to psychosis later in life. O2. Oral Session: Cognition O2.1. FIRST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS PATIENTS ACROSS EUROPE DIFFER IN INTELLECTUAL QUOTIENT (IQ) AND EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS Laura Ferraro*,1, Marta Di Forti2, Caterina La Cascia1, Giada Tripoli2, Lucia Sideli1, Ilaria Tarricone3, Diego Quattrone2, Robin Murray2, Daniele La Barbera1 1University of Palermo; 2Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, Kingâ€™s College London; 3Bologna University Background: Children who later develop Schizophrenia on average are more likely to present with lower IQ; this has been considered evidence for the neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia. Though, recent studies have shown that first episode psychosis patients with a history of cannabis use have significantly higher premorbid and current IQ compared to those who never used it. This suggests that abnormal early neurodevelopment does not explain the aetiology of all cases of Schizophrenia, leaving space to environmental hazards. The present study aims to: investigate differences in IQ, as a marker of neurodevelopment, and in exposure to environmental risk factors in a large sample first episode psychosis patients recruited across five different European countries, in comparison with their respective control groups. Methods: We analysed data on IQ, socio-demographics and cannabis use from FEP=705 (51.1 % males) and healthy controls=1.034 (48.9 % males), as part of the European network of national schizophrenia networks studying European Gene-Environment-Interaction (EUGEI) study. Patients met ICD-10 criteria for psychosis, ascertained by using OPCRIT (McGuffin et al., 1991). The CEQmv(Di Forti et al., 2009) further modified for the EUGEI study, was used to collect data on cannabis use. We used ANOVAs where IQ was used as the outcome variable and case/control status and Country were respectively entered as independent predictors, along with other predictors. Results: Case-control status (F (1,1.484)=133.1, p<0.001) and Country (F (4, 1.484)=32.1, p<0.001) resulted in interaction in predicting IQ after controlling for gender, age, ethnicity, education, occupation relationship and living status. That means, being a case and being from France (mean IQ=73.4), Spain (mean IQ=74.6) and Italy (mean IQ=75.4) was associated with the lowest IQ (F (4,1.484)=3.7, p=0.004), compared with cases from UK (mean IQ=87.1) and Holland (mean IQ=85.5). Among controls the pattern was similar but not significant. We then grouped countries as North(UK and Holland) and South â€“ Europe (Italy, Spain, France) and we compared the presence of the main risk factors between the two groups. Both patients and controls from the northern part of Europe, were more likely to be from other ethnicities (chi2(2)=93.3, p<0.001) and living alone (chi2(2)=39.6, p<0.001) than patients and controls from the southern part, who were, for instance, more likely to be married (chi2(2)=34.1, p=0.007). There were no differences in education, nor in gender distribution between cases from the north and",2018,Psychology,"list(name = ""Laura Ferraro"", ids = ""144362489""); list(name = ""Marta Di Forti"", ids = ""8136720""); list(name = ""Caterina La Cascia"", ids = ""8435635""); list(name = ""Giada Tripoli"", ids = ""8859560""); list(name = ""Lucia Sideli"", ids = ""46664821""); list(name = ""Ilaria Tarricone"", ids = ""4276041""); list(name = ""Diego Quattrone"", ids = ""3530236""); list(name = ""Robin M.

There was no evidence of publication bias in our analysis; neither funnel plot nor Egger's test was significant. Conclusion: Short sleep duration is consistently associated with increased risk of development of obesity in children, but there is no consistent conclusion to identify if too long sleep duration do associate with increased risk of childhood obesity. P60-S. Association Between Body Mass Index and Suicidal Thoughts and Attempts Among US Adolescents D. Mowls, V.K. Cheruvu. College of Public Health, Kent State University, Kent, OH Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between feelings of sadness, suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts and body mass index (BMI) in a national sample of adolescents. Methods: Cross-sectional data for the current study were derived from the 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (n1â„416410). Logistic regression models were used to model the likelihood of feelings of sadness, suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts in relation to BMI categories, adjusting for all potential confounders. Data were analyzed in 2012 and accounted for the complex sampling design of the YRBS to generalize the findings to the noninstitutionalized US population of adolescents in grades 9-12 in public and private schools. Results: The prevalence of underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese adolescents were 8.5%, 64.5%, 14.7%, and 11.1%, respectively. Underweight adolescents were more likely to have suicidal thoughts [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1 e 1.5]; suicidal plans [OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2 e 1.6]; and suicidal attempts (two or more) [OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6e2.6] when compared to healthy weight adolescents. In stratified analyses by gender, underweight males and obese females were more likely to have the outcomes when compared to healthy weights counterparts. Conclusion: Body mass index seems to be an important indicator of feelings of sadness, suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts among adolescents. These results provide new insights in understanding the association between categories of BMI and suicidal ideation. P61. Adolescent Fast Food Intake in Relation to Obesity and Chronic Disease Risk Factors M.A. Papas, K.J. Helzlsouer, L.E. Caulfield, A.J. Alberg, T.L. Gary-Webb. Department of Behavioral Health and Nutrition, University of Delaware, Newark, DE Purpose: Adolescent fast food consumption has been increasing rapidly and may contribute to obesity and chronic disease risk. The longitudinal association between adolescent fast food use, obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol was investigated within a prospective cohort study. Methods: In 1989, 789 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years participated in CLUE II, an ongoing cohort study. Fast food restaurant use was collected by food frequency questionnaire; trained staff drew blood, took blood pressure, and measured weight and height. In 2003, 216 study participants aged 26 to 32 years completed follow-up questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between adolescent fast food use and chronic disease risk factors at baseline and obesity in young adulthood. Results: Weekly adolescent fast food use was associated with adolescent obesity (OR1â„41.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.3), high blood pressure (OR1â„41.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.5), and high cholesterol (OR1â„41.5; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.2). Increases in weekly fast food intake over the 2 time points were associated with obesity in young adulthood (OR1â„41.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.5). Conclusion: Weekly consumption of fast food during adolescence was associated with obesity and chronic disease risks in adolescence and obesity in young adulthood. Adolescence may be a critical window for interventions that promote healthy diets to reduce the risk of chronic disease. P62. An Environment-Wide Association Study of Obesity M.A. Papas. Department of Behavioral Health and Nutrition, University of Delaware, Newark, DE Purpose: Obesity rates have been rising rapidly over the past twenty years. Poor diet and lack of exercise may not be the only factors responsible for this increase. Environmental exposures may alter metabolic processes and predispose some to gain weight. An environment-wide association study (EWAS) provides a useful tool for systematically evaluating multiple environmental factors potentially related to obesity. Methods: The association between more than 120 environmental factors and obesity was evaluated using data from the three most recent waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Body mass index (BMI) was estimated for each adult participant with obesity defined as a BMI greater than 30. Environmental factors included all available clinical and laboratory measures in NHANES. Logistic regressionmodels with obesity as a dichotomous outcome were adjusted for age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Multiple comparisons were controlled using an a priori false discovery rate. Results: The study included over 6,500 adult participants and the prevalence of obesity was 35% across all three NHANES waves. Obesity was positively associated with certain heavy metals including barium (p < 0.01), cesium (p < 0.05), and thallium (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The EWAS method is a valuable initial strategy for evaluating multiple environmental factors potentially related to obesity. The analysis of three waves of NHANES participants confirm the results of recent investigations that identify potential associations between environmental exposure to heavy metals and obesity. P63. The Influence of Community Health Improvement Planning on Prioritizing Obesity Prevention in US Local Health Departments K.A. Stamatakis, R.C. Brownson. Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO Purpose: Obesity prevention may not be a priority programmatic area in local health departments (LHD) in many localities with high obesity prevalence. We examined whether developing integrated community health improvement plans (CHIP) moderated the likelihood that LHDs had obesity prevention programming in the highest prevalence localities. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study by merging organizational data on LHDs from the 2005 National Profile of LHDs Study with county-level estimates of obesity prevalence from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n1â„42,300). Multi-level logistic regression models were used to examine the moderating effect of CHIP on the relationship between obesity program implementation and local obesity prevalence; adjustment for other organizational characteristics and statelevel clustering was also assessed. Results: LHDs who developed CHIPs that were integrated with state health improvement plans were more likely to have obesity prevention programs in the highest prevalence counties (odds ratio [OR]1â„42.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-4.1); therewas no association among LHDs with no CHIP (p< .0001 for interaction). The relationship persisted after adjusting for organizational characteristics (e.g., size of service population). Conclusion: This study suggests that development of CHIPs may be a useful strategy for LHDs to improve prioritization of local obesity prevention efforts, particularly when integrated with state plans.

College of Public Health, Kent State University, Kent, OH Purpose: Research has demonstrated the importance of a healthy body mass index (BMI) to reduce risk after a cardiac event; however, research has not described what womenwith a history of myocardial infarction (MI) perceive as an ideal weight or behavioral methods used to reach that weight. Methods: Cross-sectional study using data from the 2001-2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n1â„41670). Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal, overweight, and obese. Logistic regression models with outcome â€œtrying to lose weightâ€ were run separately for white, nonHispanic (NH) and black-NH. Results: Mean BMI was 27.9 (standard deviation1â„46.5) and 32.6(8.2), (p < 0.001) while reported ideal BMI was 24.0(3.2) and 26.7(4.2) (p < 0.001) for",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dana S.

26b33363767fc4380726813314341729e9d78ead,Relationship between aging and T1 relaxation time in deep gray matter: A voxelâ€based analysis,"PURPOSE
To investigate age-related changes in T1 relaxation time in deep gray matter structures in healthy volunteers using magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In all, 70 healthy volunteers (aged 20-76, mean age 42.6 years) were scanned at 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A MP2RAGE sequence was employed to quantify T1 relaxation times. After the spatial normalization of T1 maps with the diffeomorphic anatomical registration using the exponentiated Lie algebra algorithm, voxel-based regression analysis was conducted. In addition, linear and quadratic regression analyses of regions of interest (ROIs) were also performed.


RESULTS
With aging, voxel-based analysis (VBA) revealed significant T1 value decreases in the ventral-inferior putamen, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, whereas T1 values significantly increased in the thalamus and white matter as well (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 at cluster level, false discovery rate). ROI analysis revealed that T1 values in the nucleus accumbens linearly decreased with aging (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0016), supporting the VBA result. T1 values in the thalamus (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), substantia nigra (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003), and globus pallidus (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) had a best fit to quadratic curves, with the minimum T1 values observed between 30 and 50 years of age.


CONCLUSION
Age-related changes in T1 relaxation time vary by location in deep gray matter.

0560acfbb5aa08189ce62b86fb489c6edd60bfa8,Abstract 53: Transcriptomics and Methylomics of Atherosclerosis in Circulating Monocytes - the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis,"Little is known regarding the transcriptional and epigenetic basis for atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Here we integrate transcriptomic (Illumina HumanHT-12 v4) and methylomic (Illumina 450K array) data from purified monocytes with concurrent CVD risk factors and measures of atherosclerosis - carotid plaque (CP) identified using ultrasound and coronary artery calcium (CAC), from 1,208 randomly selected participants (554 whites, 260 blacks, 394 Hispanics) of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Association analysis was performed using linear and logistic regression, adjusting for demographics, technical covariates, and other known CVD risk factors. A false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 was used to control for multiple comparisons.

RESULTS: We identified expression of two genes, ARID5B (a transcription factor) and PDLIM7, positively associated with both CP and CAC, and 17 additional genes associated with only CAC . We also identified 29 and seven differentially methylated CpGs associated with CP and CAC, respectively, including a CpG at ILVBL associated with both CP and CAC. Eleven of these atherosclerosis CpGs were also associated with cis-gene expression, including an ARID5B expression-associated methylation site (cg25953130, ARID5B intron) which overlapped a predicted strong enhancer, a transcription factor binding site (for EP300), and a DNase I hotspot (ENCODE and BLUEPRINT monocyte data). The inverse association between methylation of this ARID5B CpG and atherosclerosis (CP:p=4.3x10-7, FDR=0.01; CAC: p= 2.4x10-5, FDR=0.32) appeared to be mediated through ARID5B expression (CP: p=2.1x10-4, CAC: p=2.1 x10-3, using Structural Equation modeling with bootstrapping). Furthermore, many other known risk factors for CVD (age, ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, HDL, and interleukin-6 levels) were also associated with ARID5B expression at genome-wide levels of significance. The ARID5B associations with atherosclerosis at gene expression and methylation levels together explain an additional 2.3% variability in CP above and beyond known CVD risk factors, and were consistent across age (< or â‰¥65 years), sex, race/ethnicity, CVD status, or statin use subgroups, as well as the independent sites of data collection. ARID5B expression was also positively associated with prevalent CVD (p=0.006).

CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent multi-omic profiling of atherogenic-related cells coupled with state-of-the-art measurements of atherosclerosis in a large, well-phenotyped, multi-ethnic cohort provide novel insights into the biomarkers and the potential molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis. In particular, our data on ARID5B , taken together with previously reported experimental evidence for its role in promoting lipid accumulation and smooth muscle cell differentiation, strongly suggests an atherogenic role for this gene.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yongmei Liu"", ids = ""49420275""); list(name = ""Jingzhong Ding"", ids = ""2171224""); list(name = ""Lindsay M Reynolds"", ids = ""34738609""); list(name = ""Jackson Taylor"", ids = ""118197660""); list(name = ""Kurt Lohman"", ids = ""47474803""); list(name = ""David S Siscovick"", ids = ""3597567""); list(name = ""Stephen S.

32b366b680782689e89b53c5d276d21ed4e63889,Evaluating the Impact of Different Sequence Databases on Metaproteome Analysis: Insights from a Lab-Assembled Microbial Mixture,"Metaproteomics enables the investigation of the protein repertoire expressed by complex microbial communities. However, to unleash its full potential, refinements in bioinformatic approaches for data analysis are still needed. In this context, sequence databases selection represents a major challenge. This work assessed the impact of different databases in metaproteomic investigations by using a mock microbial mixture including nine diverse bacterial and eukaryotic species, which was subjected to shotgun metaproteomic analysis. Then, both the microbial mixture and the single microorganisms were subjected to next generation sequencing to obtain experimental metagenomic- and genomic-derived databases, which were used along with public databases (namely, NCBI, UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, parsed at different taxonomic levels) to analyze the metaproteomic dataset. First, a quantitative comparison in terms of number and overlap of peptide identifications was carried out among all databases. As a result, only 35% of peptides were common to all database classes; moreover, genus/species-specific databases provided up to 17% more identifications compared to databases with generic taxonomy, while the metagenomic database enabled a slight increment in respect to public databases. Then, database behavior in terms of false discovery rate and peptide degeneracy was critically evaluated. Public databases with generic taxonomy exhibited a markedly different trend compared to the counterparts. Finally, the reliability of taxonomic attribution according to the lowest common ancestor approach (using MEGAN and Unipept software) was assessed. The level of misassignments varied among the different databases, and specific thresholds based on the number of taxon-specific peptides were established to minimize false positives. This study confirms that database selection has a significant impact in metaproteomics, and provides critical indications for improving depth and reliability of metaproteomic results. Specifically, the use of iterative searches and of suitable filters for taxonomic assignments is proposed with the aim of increasing coverage and trustworthiness of metaproteomic data.",2013,Biology;

e32d42f1ae2eb280b9fc75040816444167511ad5,Comparison of one-stage and two-stage genome-wide association studies,"Linear mixed models are widely used in humans, animals, and plants to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A characteristic of experimental designs for plants is that experimental units are typically multiple-plant plots of families or lines that are replicated across environments. This structure can present computational challenges to conducting a genome scan on raw (plot-level) data. Two-stage methods have been proposed to reduce the complexity and increase the computational speed of whole-genome scans. The first stage of the analysis fits raw data to a model including environment and line effects, but no individual marker effects. The second stage involves the whole genome scan of marker tests using summary values for each line as the dependent variable. Missing data and unbalanced experimental designs can result in biased estimates of marker association effects from two-stage analyses. In this study, we developed a weighted two-stage analysis to reduce bias and improve power of GWAS while maintaining the computational efficiency of two-stage analyses. Simulation based on real marker data of a diverse panel of maize inbred lines was used to compare power and false discovery rate of the new weighted two-stage method to single-stage and other two-stage analyses and to compare different two-stage models. In the case of severely unbalanced data, only the weighted two-stage GWAS has power and false discovery rate similar to the one-stage analysis. The weighted GWAS method has been implemented in the open-source software TASSEL.",2017,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shang Xue"", ids = ""50120097""); list(name = ""Funda Ogut"", ids = ""33229832""); list(name = ""Zachary R.

f5c0d10845a8923c149fa56b69bc19ad7331f018,Detecting and estimating sparse mixtures,"Sparse Mixture Models have important applications in many areas, such as Signal and Image Processing, Genomics, Covert Communication, etc. In my talk, I will consider the problems of detecting and estimating sparse mixtuers. Detection Higher Criticism is a statistic inspired by a multiple comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey (1976) (but as a term, Higher Criticism is invented by a German historian Johann Eichhorn (1787)). We are able to show that the resulting Higher Criticism statistic is effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero; the subtlety of this â€˜sparse normal meansâ€™ testing problem can be seen from work of Ingster (1999) and Jin(2002), who studied such problems in great detail. In their studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little noticeable effect on the distribution on the p-values either for the bulk of the tests or for the few most highly significant tests. In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely-specified alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses. We show that the higher criticism is successful throughout the same region of amplitude vs. sparsity where the likelihood ratio test would succeed. Since it does not require a specification of the alternative, this shows that Higher Criticism is in a sense optimally adaptive to unknown sparsity and size of the non-null effects. While our theoretical work is largely asymptotic, we provide simulations in finite samples. We also show Higher Criticism works very well over a range of non-Gaussian cases. Estimation False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is a recent innovation in multiple hypothesis testing, in which one seeks to ensure that at most a certain fraction of the rejected null hypotheses correspond to false rejections (i.e. false discoveries). The FDR principle also can be used in highly multivariate estimation problems, where it has recently been shown to provide an asymptotically minimax solution to the problem of estimating a sparse mean vector in the presence of Gaussian white noise. In effect, FDR provides an effective method of setting a threshold for separating signal from noise when the signal is sparse and the noise is Gaussian. In this talk we consider the application of FDR thresholding to non-Gaussian settings, in hopes of learning whether the good asymptotic properties of FDR thresholding as an estimation tool hold more broadly than just at the standard Gaussian model. We study sparse exponential model and sparse Poisson model, which are important models for nonGaussian data, and have applications in many areas as well, such as Astronomy and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) etc. We show that the FDR principle also provide an asymptotically minimax solution to the problem of estimating a sparse mean vector even in the presence of exponential/Poisson noise, and in effect FDR provides an effective method of setting a threshold for separating signal from noise when the signal is sparse and the noise is exponential/Poisson. We compare our results with work in the Gaussian setting by Abramovich, Benjamini, Donoho, Johnstone (2000). Joint work with David L.

9b5d1ad3c59d8becdbb53110264e1ad92991ce91,Evidence for gene-gene epistatic interactions among susceptibility loci for systemic lupus erythematosus.,"OBJECTIVE
Several confirmed genetic susceptibility loci for lupus have been described. To date, no clear evidence for genetic epistasis in lupus has been established. The aim of this study was to test for gene-gene interactions in a number of known lupus susceptibility loci.


METHODS
Eighteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms tagging independent and confirmed lupus susceptibility loci were genotyped in a set of 4,248 patients with lupus and 3,818 normal healthy control subjects of European descent. Epistasis was tested by a 2-step approach using both parametric and nonparametric methods. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to correct for multiple testing.


RESULTS
We detected and confirmed gene-gene interactions between the HLA region and CTLA4, IRF5, and ITGAM and between PDCD1 and IL21 in patients with lupus. The most significant interaction detected by parametric analysis was between rs3131379 in the HLA region and rs231775 in CTLA4 (interaction odds ratio 1.19, Z = 3.95, P = 7.8 Ã— 10(-5) [FDR â‰¤0.05], P for multifactor dimensionality reduction = 5.9 Ã— 10(-45)). Importantly, our data suggest that in patients with lupus, the presence of the HLA lupus risk alleles in rs1270942 and rs3131379 increases the odds of also carrying the lupus risk allele in IRF5 (rs2070197) by 17% and 16%, respectively (P = 0.0028 and P = 0.0047, respectively).


CONCLUSION
We provide evidence for gene-gene epistasis in systemic lupus erythematosus.

With unknown distribution of the data, existing shape morphometry analysis involves testing thousands of hypotheses for statistically significant effects through permutation. In this work, we develop a hybrid method to improve the system's efficiency by computing the raw p-values of the nonparametric permutation tests only within a region of interest (ROI) of the surface. The ROI is identified through a parametric Pearson type III distribution approximation. Furthermore, a ROI based adaptive procedure is utilized to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for increased power of finding the significance.",2007,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chunxiao Zhou"", ids = ""48622211""); list(name = ""Denise C.

a33318bcc20e58bf2becca8b59cbacb75641dd5b,"[Association between 23 urinary metals and mean platelet volume among a community-dwelling population in Wuhan, China].","OBJECTIVE
To investigate the potential association between 23 urinary metals and mean platelet volume (MPV) among a community population in Wuhan.


METHODS
A total of 3 053 community residents who lived in the sampling buildings for more than 5 years, aged from 18 to 80 years, were recruited using a stratified, cluster sampling approach in Wuhan city, China. Blood and urine samples were obtained from participants in the morning under fasting conditions. Urinary metals, including aluminum, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, antimony, barium, tungsten, thallium, lead and uranium, were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The MPV contents were determined using a fully automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Participants with missing data on covariates or cardiovascular disease were excluded. According to the reference intorvals of MPV for Chinese adults, the participants were classified into normal (7.0-11.0 fl) and high MPV (>11.0 fl) subgroups. Data from 2 203 participants were used to evaluate the associations between urinary metals and MPV levels using generalized linear regression models, and the risk of abnormal elevation of MPV using multivariable logistic regression models. The false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P-value from 23 hypothesis tests was used to adjust for multiple testing.


RESULTS
After adjusting for potential confounders, urinary concentrations of arsenic (P50=2.431 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) and molybdenum (P50=4.035 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) were significantly associated with increased MPV levels and the risk of abnormal elevation of MPV. In contrast, urinary aluminum (P50=2.706 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) and thallium (P50=0.046 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) were associated with decreased MPV levels, but also the risk of abnormal elevation of MPV. The regression coefficients and 95% CIs were 0.119 (0.043-0.196) for arsenic (FDR-adjusted P=0.018), 0.119 (0.042-0.195) for molybdenum (FDR-adjusted P=0.018), -0.115 (-0.195--0.034) for aluminum (FDR-adjusted P=0.029), and -0.307 (-0.386- -0.228) for thallium (FDR-adjusted P<0.001), respectively. When comparing the extreme quartiles for arsenic, molybdenum, aluminum and thallium, adjusted OR and the 95%CIs were 1.830 (1.382-2.423), 1.496 (1.125-1.989), 0.566 (0.412-0.779) and 0.302 (0.219-0.416), respectively, and FDR-adjusted P-values were <0.001,<0.014,<0.008 and<0.001, respectively. Moreover, significant associations were found between an increased risk of abnormal MPV elevation with urinary iron (P50=6.716 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) , antimony (P50=0.014 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) and uranium (P50=0.003 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) , and a decreased risk with urinary tungsten (P50=0.010 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) and lead (P50=0.265 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) . When comparing the extreme quartiles for iron, antimony and uranium, the respective adjusted OR (95%CI) were 1.866 (1.395-2.496), 1.507 (1.111-2.043) and 1.452 (1.063-1.984), and the respective FDR-adjusted P-values were <0.001,<0.022 and<0.012. The respective adjusted OR (95%CI) were 0.551 (0.417-0.726) and 0.534 (0.394-0.725), and the respective FDR-adjusted P-values were<0.001 and<0.001, when comparing the extreme quartiles for tungsten and lead. Based on multi-metal models, urinary chromium (P50=0.120 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) and selenium (P50=0.646 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) were associated with increased risk of abnormal MPV, while urinary nickel (P50=0.193 Î¼g/mmol creatinine) was associated with decreased risk of abnormal MPV. When comparing the extreme quartiles for chromium, selenium and nickel, adjusted OR (95% CI) were 1.578 (1.054-2.363), 1.718 (1.159-2.549) and 0.535 (0.373-0.767), respectively, and the FDR-adjusted P-values were 0.017, 0.028 and 0.002, respectively.


CONCLUSION
In the general population of Wuhan city, exposure to aluminum, chromium, iron, nickel, arsenic, selenium, molybdenum, antimony, tungsten, thallium, lead and uranium were all associated with abnormal MPV elevation.",2016,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""W Feng"", ids = ""153233406""); list(name = ""Xiaoying He"", ids = ""47023600""); list(name = ""Yanqiu Yu"", ids = ""47112038""); list(name = ""Yyn Li-Gu"", ids = ""1445515332""); list(name = ""Xiaotian M Zhang"", ids = ""46447100""); list(name = ""J Yuan"", ids = ""13372721""); list(name = ""Wai Hong Chen"", ids = ""50504135""); list(name = ""Tangchun Wu"", ids = ""3567607"")",,,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],50 8,"

97e87a444ff1c5be4dc3dddcb7208112bbcc7534,False Discovery Rate Analysis of Brain Diffusion Direction Maps,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a novel modality of magnetic resonance imaging that allows noninvasive mapping of the brain's white matter. A particular map derived from DTI measurements is a map of water principal diffusion directions, which are proxies for neural fiber directions. We consider a study in which diffusion direction maps were acquired for two groups of subjects. The objective of the analysis is to find regions of the brain in which the corresponding diffusion directions differ between the groups. This is attained by first computing a test statistic for the difference in direction at every brain location using a Watson model for directional data. Interesting locations are subsequently selected with control of the false discovery rate. More accurate modeling of the null distribution is obtained using an empirical null density based on the empirical distribution of the test statistics across the brain. Further, substantial improvements in power are achieved by local spatial averaging of the test statistic map. Although the focus is on one particular study and imaging technology, the proposed inference methods can be applied to other large scale simultaneous hypothesis testing problems with a continuous underlying spatial structure.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Armin Schwartzman"", ids = ""153500444""); list(name = ""Robert F.

Briefly, 151 women with HER2+ BC were treated with lapatinib and trastuzumab, and hormonal therapy if HR positive, for 18 weeks. TIL levels were determined at baseline (n=148), after 2 weeks of treatment (n=134) and at surgery (n=137). Expression of 560 genes, including immune-related genes (e.g. CD8A, CD4, PD1 and PDL1) was measured at the same timepoints (baseline n=151, 2-weeks n=144, surgery n=144) using the nCounter platform. Intrinsic subtyping at baseline was determined using the PAM50 gene expression predictor. Changes in TILs between 2 time-points were determined by paired t-tests. Correlation of TILs with gene expression was assessed by quantitative SAM analysis using a False Discovery Rate Results: Compared to baseline, a significant increase in TILs was observed at week 2 in HR- (p Conclusions: In early HER2+ BC, a general increase in TILs is observed following 2 weeks of dual HER2 blockade. This observation is mostly observed in HR- and HER2-E subtype, but regardless of pathological response at surgery. After 2 weeks of treatment, TILs consistently decrease in patients achieving a pCR, whereas two main patterns of TILs expression are observed in patients with residual disease at surgery. Nonetheless, most residual tumors at surgery are inflamed (i.e. TILs â‰¥5%) and might be good candidates for clinical trials evaluating adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors.

fd4ddf5d0efec46733b27db40ddb890544baddfc,Machine Learning-Based Gully Erosion Susceptibility Mapping: A Case Study of Eastern India,"Gully erosion is a form of natural disaster and one of the land loss mechanisms causing severe problems worldwide. This study aims to delineate the areas with the most severe gully erosion susceptibility (GES) using the machine learning techniques Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT), NaÃ¯ve Bayes Tree (NBT), and Tree Ensemble (TE). The gully inventory map (GIM) consists of 120 gullies. Of the 120 gullies, 84 gullies (70%) were used for training and 36 gullies (30%) were used to validate the models. Fourteen gully conditioning factors (GCFs) were used for GES modeling and the relationships between the GCFs and gully erosion was assessed using the weight-of-evidence (WofE) model. The GES maps were prepared using RF, GBRT, NBT, and TE and were validated using area under the receiver operating characteristic(AUROC) curve, the seed cell area index (SCAI) and five statistical measures including precision (PPV), false discovery rate (FDR), accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). Nearly 7% of the basin has high to very high susceptibility for gully erosion. Validation results proved the excellent ability of these models to predict the GES. Of the analyzed models, the RF (AUROC = 0.96, PPV = 1.00, FDR = 0.00, accuracy = 0.87, MAE = 0.11, RMSE = 0.19 for validation dataset) is accurate enough for modeling and better suited for GES modeling than the other models. Therefore, the RF model can be used to model the GES areas not only in this river basin but also in other areas with the same geo-environmental conditions.",2020,Engineering; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sunil Saha"", ids = ""79392261""); list(name = ""Jagabandhu Roy"", ids = ""107920994""); list(name = ""Alireza Arabameri"", ids = ""115600072""); list(name = ""Thomas Blaschke"", ids = ""50594282""); list(name = ""Dieu Tien Bui"", ids = ""2382463"")",,5fcbe95f7e9647709ff740e2a85ac34161053975; c7d496107ae0f2c60864ba2b14977ce6c480d5b2; 1679beddda3a183714d380e944fe6bf586c083cd; 8dce8ee31abff6423a50e1ad0facb9c4304edda6; af6f5728b6ab827de365cd0fa326c339d583d7b9; a21c8232c2ce6c9e92f25d2452a313abf74e4af3; 18b4950d0940e8e40ebabd26f3add2092915cdc0; 34ae1e95775cfec793441c9f588a68c0020f21e5; ecb053b53815eae56b4683bc976f59560cb8172e; e5ea460b39043edc3cd09127d54cf02e24bacd38; ff433ad0da9c0c910e5a378759a97b0c68847de4; f06b90c698cb4002436b692f0bd63a52d111fca7; 3cf05730aab0ae38358b82502a649faae31f6ec5; d0022439c3e0811d3da067bdf1895b74b6cea201; ca91950557f4dd193af0e7dec912a630ddbfd711; 9a12aedb33a95ea688d6defe870d9833b8ce1a70; 82ce9fb98e5ddc9f5b4356f7237112cee9d4db4d; bd3b53698835a95cd3c2f6d4724ebfd9b9f0b7e3; 345624548fc7c49dbf01216f79ad43377d2c405d; 62b6f624c20a87df98a5db496a5b1400a107fd44; 6ca72e0656596f30f5f463f594b99a0cd8db2eef; ada98c0b8e375e30498741b35a66b3005182add0; d0c573ccab6df91e06a0d0cb63771eadd152b123; dbb74d7bfd3cafde5148358ded4f493a46b9d2b7; e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0; 62ad7fc14ebba9ddda40b46d198c604808f6f4e0; 76570af91938c4e68478fb55381c3824ea6b4fb8; 5b16ed4ac860988a345ad33e598ae2246a648abe; 3cf75208fc7463e2989530fc53b5d6ed015c8a9f; 808832e95f4212adbfe8aad3aeda87999dfe5add; 53e04e3db85f13ff829d2dd482f7fb2b7665208e; 648429b5dec8c8ebb87ad05d5be0b8bb0fb089ef; 79c1a491669c06c91df90b70e268df30ba2f0e50; 0e2a2f1e35b71cd111d92f1c89cecc98feeb030d; 3aea4aa798ef536df806af871279017c17278354; 10e5c6c1b5f17e60d88d041923c7fea79be08941; 61cc526d8c282e65204ba1a2f891722cb81182c2; 7db5dea9f7ec7f697449f243f73d2eebd8f8ff0f; afde79e2c147468b375191feb72b939e3a5e6aa8; 9e79ce73f043694302086233c12b497c3defac09; 5a03a6aaf42e07854de6c1e95e9a366dfb62ccfb; 81df2710a7d4d94fc235e61b0d9fb999295ba9a8; f6a3d855d78fe2826c6287bc85f5f4d6bc57a557; 5ec0090f993d30a82aab647365d8f6be9971b7c0; 0ad2650262d1b123dca05ef3bb634cef4e96508a; b40fa18ae6ec051c370d73fdc84afa44a74cacae; 19610284b552cd509f1c467020933c2849c170ea; b58a7c4c6e0ee21c78804a04e356d34038d0e598; 6b99fd3b2273b325fa3a60e0eea58db51e38c9f3; 83a16881ace806f531ad5e0990eee6f0f3035aa1; 680ce0a14c3a36299fa60d16a8b65e1b404076af; c93a8d8219568007d99ed585c1ade79c69c1cd32; 0910e0fb4449bdc68fab2250ad890fb67e48606d; 6f5683346fb77724b2d0fda854487ea00821ccb3; 43b8fa0b305e41a7a1bdf09962374a63b0653a69; ede845cf131ae47348f8bb19da333f0b1ed380bd; cbb943308e0d430473d4c35b3e4f64dab6d6bb60; 8fea91614de7a3ad785ede6ec58743859be4ef49; e7ea7a07b8f2ecd235cd092bdabedc2a41e3655b; eff716ff714d2a93ccd69ae887f969a303428d95; 0dfef05f0a19674d6d0c633b76fb16c8f1edb367; b43a5d7c9e7f0d6a0582f1a331f9333b53fcc556; bc212f121c768faa37c9fb7fb73b64845b259e54; 38c3aa8fbef1340e0033054ed72d949945542aae; 8fcff7f3348e621dbe1ab8e08f51f9f47756d8f2; a915d9b04ce480d9b6be1a08d33207d8a2770964; 171a30b053e76c457746eb72a254ec799eff0418; a3010445f6c4b8274dcba5b5d918f5e66970d4f4; 1e02ce4e1a44b33be4d85f2805eb3d28bb0d7429; e374dc40d6e4af52f14e924cce7ddbd7d5189375; 10d669f138c65088900d6ccf625a49793c811641; 24aac356c24ced0cc0bf0f52e2434440fab1783d; a396955e95a5f51cf066a8f1f3e8f1125da1bc45; c8d62808f0837fdfee1548696b10a683a17336cd; 95f117153df15af2ca9a32dafbf703707a2ee1ca; a2014f0dfde30c2711919009b609357b5359aa9c; 4e681b863bf4a1e9d7651cbc6815801cfaa2d97d; 8329a728f410578fe8868f715b8e684b528df283; 2aa11d9bd9f808b4c561b2ac29611dd53c1da2db; d7f072c3f433c73e98ceb248de122d951b3e8a41; 334aa025f7f183931a6abe907fe86981f2778313,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",20,

It is often of additional interest to identify sets of genes, known a priori to have similar biologic function, associated with the outcome.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a general permutation-based framework for gene set testing that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) while accounting for the dependency among the genes within and across each gene set. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated using three public microarray data sets. The performance of our proposed method is contrasted to two other existing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Analysis (GSA) methods.ConclusionsOur simulations show that the proposed method controls the FDR at the desired level.

3b12b15b786feb77684c6d3360d9f1b39ed1ea60,Comparison of lymphocyte immune phenotypes in bronchoalveolar lavage of non-smoking patients with sarcoidosis and other interstitial lung diseases.,"Background
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as complementary method is still used as ancillary tool in diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. Tobacco smoking has been described to affect the BAL lavage cellular profile. To our knowledge, only few reports have so far investigated CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ lymphocyte subsets in non-smoking sarcoidosis patients additionally stratified according to CXR stage, and compared them to other non-smoking patients with interstitial lung diseases (ILDs).


Methods
We compared lymphocytes immune phenotypes, subsets, with CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cell markers, in the non-smoking subjects (n=297) including the patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (S), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (n=22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) (n=15), other interstitial idiopathic pneumonias (OIIPs) (n=39). According to prognosis, the patients with S were divided into four groups: 18 patients with LÃ¶fgren's syndrome (LS) in chest X-ray (CXR) â‰¤1 stage, 64 patients without LS in CXR â‰¤1 stage, 113 patients in CXR 2 stage and 26 patients with advanced CXR â‰¥3 stage.


Results
After the use of false discovery rate (FDR) correction, relative numbers (%) of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4/CD3+CD8 ratio showed the most significant differences between the non-smokers with S (both with/without LS) and the non-smokers with other ILDs (IPF, OIIPs, HP). These lymphocytes subsets were further altered in the non-smokers with CXR stage 2 compared to the non-smokers with other ILDs (IPF, OIIPs, HP). We did not observe any differences in these lymphocyte subsets and CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+ ratio between the non-smokers with advanced sarcoidosis stage (CXR â‰¥3) and the non-smokers with IPF.


Conclusions
Our data on the non-smokers confirmed the presence of the typical BAL cellular profile in sarcoidosis. The BAL cellular profile was helpful namely for differentiation of less advanced sarcoidosis. Its definite diagnostic utility should be the subject of further clinical studies with large numbers of the well characterized patients taking into consideration other clinical factors influencing BAL cellular profile, such as smoking or treatment.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eva NovosadovÃ¡"", ids = ""34745192""); list(name = ""Zdenka Navratilova"", ids = ""35002567""); list(name = ""Marta OrdeltovÃ¡"", ids = ""13189200""); list(name = ""Monika Å½Å¯rkovÃ¡"", ids = ""4484379""); list(name = ""JaromÃ­r Zatloukal"", ids = ""1391146455""); list(name = ""Vitezslav Kolek"", ids = ""5290484""); list(name = ""Martin Petrek"", ids = ""2551691"")",3b12b15b786feb77684c6d3360d9f1b39ed1ea60,1a7fd6062c2cec923be6987b5730d750c43a843c; c1c28faa05e8ec5744478f1ec59fb42762dcbef7; 33130164603f7190ceab89bf74ef66b74cf6c21b; 6b4530b91b9b5c772ac68f0f791cde959f31b1ad; 27eec3c732773ad61e309b4adf60c4b9ce973722; 1145308872052109ee634cb185a526f8968c5275; 4981d77b965b0587637dbdc1ef4aba645fcb8466; bb4cf586ebd0635ff699513bf1dda92735a612d6; fcbf3102fd7392d0407825917e4b499f2c8bf014; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8ce4e91cc62fa5c5f98a0a4b7711109b112e7fe2; 853509d50fdda0216a266e333a272cf4931860e3; ec63bb96402fff3a7daa533b9b2beddf6eaa6317; 4f213775cb29d39c1c8cebf47ac8fa17208a68b8; f1ecbd00b704d15be958e73d85b6911b8f17c3b3; 1b8afe7024faadb9e26007c4f7534a66ad164b15; 38af6a6b9e2abe973ae970f9741b0a75440a9223; 8a3fa4f3abf9d4ea7d56e9fdaab7d8e2920cb6aa; 18b8fa1c9179004d0bc31093d8fbcc071a0a70ee; c107275ce001195509cd0cbad734978ca2f0b3a1; 18893fc0bf2149c121215644115db17ef804cb42; 032de3cf5fd6c927c094ef7ecfc9bad497836f29; c2bcc9cd7c809a5f6ce0f62ea95d8f204cc1869d; 58037f049f36adeebac3f45cbf167c842e35cb64; cc06952ef5c5cbfc922d8bcce6fa26e576ab58c1; 8fb50468d81e7ffc4f208b49020e05def70d27ae; b17fbf5782abc2bfa50f85d749b93f7ed2c4eb7c; 4c08b7a1550e3420c476f39bd116b4793ceacb0b; 3b12b15b786feb77684c6d3360d9f1b39ed1ea60; 498022f1bc7944141cf48d596b312d7de758492e; 7b409e2df2e20d532f45ef029f4c546fcb0807a0,Journal of thoracic disease,11 6,"

Inactivating somatic mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor are uncommon in DLBCL, prompting speculation regarding alternative mechanisms of modulating p53 activity in this disease. As part of a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in DLBCL, we recently integrated high-resolution copy number data and transcription profiles in a series of 81 newly diagnosed previously untreated DLBCLs. Copy number (CN) alterations were evaluated using Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 data on over 1.8 million genomic loci (906,000 SNP probe sets and 946,000 copy number probes) and a data-processing pipeline incorporating the normalization, calibration, and segmentation of the CN profiles and their analysis by the GISTIC algorithm. The genes within the peak and region of each GISTIC-identified alteration were tested for association with the corresponding transcripts9 expression and significance values were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing by the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure, with the correction accounting for both the multiple genes within each peak and the multiple peaks. The signature for a given copy number alteration was then defined as the set of within-peak and -region transcripts with FDR q-values Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Bjoern Chapuy"", ids = ""50034575""); list(name = ""Stefano Monti"", ids = ""144516807""); list(name = ""Kunihiko Takeyama"", ids = ""32730836""); list(name = ""Gad A.

In order to screen the altered gene expression profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with osteoporosis, we performed an integrated analysis of the online microarray studies of osteoporosis.


METHODS
We searched the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database for microarray studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with osteoporosis. Subsequently, we integrated gene expression data sets from multiple microarray studies to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with osteoporosis and normal controls. Gene function analysis was performed to uncover the functions of identified DEGs.


RESULTS
A total of three microarray studies were selected for integrated analysis. In all, 1125 genes were found to be signiï¬cantly differentially expressed between osteoporosis patients and normal controls, with 373 upregulated and 752 downregulated genes. Positive regulation of the cellular amino metabolic process (gene ontology (GO): 0033240, false discovery rate (FDR) = 1.00E + 00) was significantly enriched under the GO category for biological processes, while for molecular functions, flavin adenine dinucleotide binding (GO: 0050660, FDR = 3.66E-01) and androgen receptor binding (GO: 0050681, FDR = 6.35E-01) were significantly enriched. DEGs were enriched in many osteoporosis-related signalling pathways, including those of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis showed that the significant hub proteins contained ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, X-linked (Degree = 99), ubiquitin specific peptidase 19 (Degree = 57) and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 B (Degree = 57).


CONCLUSION
Analysis of gene function of identified differentially expressed genes may expand our understanding of fundamental mechanisms leading to osteoporosis. Moreover, significantly enriched pathways, such as MAPK and calcium, may involve in osteoporosis through osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation.Cite this article: J. J. Li, B. Q. Wang, Q.

f25d4112273f1783260f0301a07fc52300d927af,A Markov random field model for network-based analysis of genomic data,"MOTIVATION
A central problem in genomic research is the identification of genes and pathways involved in diseases and other biological processes. The genes identified or the univariate test statistics are often linked to known biological pathways through gene set enrichment analysis in order to identify the pathways involved. However, most of the procedures for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes do not utilize the known pathway information in the phase of identifying such genes. In this article, we develop a Markov random field (MRF)-based method for identifying genes and subnetworks that are related to diseases. Such a procedure models the dependency of the DE patterns of genes on the networks using a local discrete MRF model.


RESULTS
Simulation studies indicated that the method is quite effective in identifying genes and subnetworks that are related to disease and has higher sensitivity and lower false discovery rates than the commonly used procedures that do not use the pathway structure information. Applications to two breast cancer microarray gene expression datasets identified several subnetworks on several of the KEGG transcriptional pathways that are related to breast cancer recurrence or survival due to breast cancer.


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed MRF-based model efficiently utilizes the known pathway structures in identifying the DE genes and the subnetworks that might be related to phenotype. As more biological networks are identified and documented in databases, the proposed method should find more applications in identifying the subnetworks that are related to diseases and other biological processes.",2007,Computer Science;

e1c4b0524476cae04941581b2fccbcfc8de36a03,Noxious somatosensory stimulation affects the default mode of brain function: evidence from functional MR imaging.,"PURPOSE
To investigate whether default mode network (DMN) spatial properties can be directly affected by pain, with a comparison of painful and nonpainful conditions.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
The authors performed a functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study, approved by the local institutional ethics committee, involving 10 healthy male subjects (age range, 18-45 years) who gave written informed consent. The subjects underwent two experimental sessions of median nerve electrical stimulation at painful and nonpainful levels. Independent component analysis of the functional MR imaging data was performed to determine the DMN spatiotemporal pattern. Group-level DMN connectivity maps for painful and nonpainful conditions were obtained (P < .001, corrected with false discovery rate). The contrast between the connectivity maps in the two conditions was also computed (P < .05, corrected with false discovery rate).


RESULTS
The DMN maintained its typical temporal properties but was subject to modifications in connectivity pattern during painful stimulation, affecting the brain areas associated with pain processing. Increased connectivity in painful conditions was found mainly in the left prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex-precuneus, and decreased connectivity was found in the lateral parietal cortex.


CONCLUSION
Study findings were in line with the impairments of the DMN reported in patients with chronic pain. They support the hypothesis that alteration of the DMN connectivity pattern localized in specific brain areas during acute pain, if repeated across time, might induce permanent changes that could disrupt the DMN functional architecture.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dante Mantini"", ids = ""2702784""); list(name = ""Massimo Caulo"", ids = ""2712204""); list(name = ""Antonio Ferretti"", ids = ""11608591""); list(name = ""Gian Luca Romani"", ids = ""6776915""); list(name = ""Armando Tartaro"", ids = ""2876828"")",ec3fd387e176fc3dc59612f2db926e314cd5ff9d; 5bc285ee5fa8700e86d1fd9460fa2570055de517; 47229a8135bd7e753b82d3a34875666e9f0e3296; d1147cecc9f73eca4a7d006c0dbb2d0bc49a690d; b26cf976601610071ff1ccfbcfbef5413ceb5c9d; d89a6390c58958e1fd39b61e0b1010cdd72e73d6; 4d984e3b100ff698cee40f76a0cebba32c633cea; 0f14ca8cac430c972562b33d5082baa0324aa45e; 81c6b2b0f702fb8c03f4888f590e8c0be1bb8dca; db8f0f4d76425aecddab51631b919994f8a07e3c; 74495c1460434747097dd89ff091d70f1e9cf86f; cb296711c37762ea3c0880dd6664fe06d8f24e0c; 0be88b3935661a83e407798c78662877ed6cbb12; 6c59eaf3963851daa3813e27a7dead68d08621a8; b171dc74abeac13984cd33959a9627caf47ba8cb; a781b674588967c145d176303310d501c08ae243; 39c9dbae334f1338900fd96ce9f5654926e34f5f; 3a2734f13ef0b531a74a470525a9ed47c9110e72; 9ea3a1b7ffa4b7a734ac5f1b0a92c4c650de9251; ee319989d33c39e4a14827ba720f72f53baea478; 1ff8a6e4cc241200ad9879f83b4ba62e9da3c618; a0fe76394bba3006c7bb88d5fa9a9690101ed01c; beb303ac46d729512bf5c83d9be06cfa5470e186; d3038bbebfbc76bed1e8736d0798a15a5f0f57e2; 68b2fb90fa501319b9c980b252f1476d52b22546; 4ddb1fba91e616fea941c980ac54d85a0a36f9b2; 129625709500879088e7acd8fafa2477e4b0e82d; 1bdafc53dae744275f029461e0065ce247ee6186; 139dd3e12b9d01c55d70b7aff11745d56552340f; e62e9178ee780bb692c696aa3793e51144474b90; 1351b51fcefe5e51c412e6c7722b8113ddeeca62; 91556495cee23a23fbfbfce8c2bb944435fea811; a2b500d71e8b8821c8a3f3edce1e8c0be7c79290; c22ec7e25d95eae4b83a25033b38268b895af988; 849646577a639c369c0f5a2f0881b60189714ffe,,Radiology,253 3,"

c4792aa728d73d9bfc58f01fb0cc23b460482fcd,High angular resolution diffusion imaging correlates of depression in Parkinsonâ€™s disease: a connectometry study,"Depression is a significant disabling feature in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). However, the neuropathology of this comorbidity is still unclear. In fact, few studies have tried to elucidate the neural correlates of depression in PD and have mostly examined specific regions of interest. In this study, we applied diffusion MRI connectometry, a powerful complementary approach to investigate alterations in whole white matter pathways regarding the severity of depressive symptoms. Using a multiple regression model, the correlation of severity of depressive symptoms assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) with white matter connectivity was surveyed in 27 non-demented PD patients related to 26 age, sex, and educational level-matched healthy subjects. Results revealed areas, where white matter quantitative anisotropy (QA) was correlated with depression score in PD patients, without any significant association in healthy controls. The analysis showed a significant negative association (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05) between scores on depression subscale of HADS in PD patients and QA of left Cingulum, Genu, and Splenium of the Corpus Callosum, and anterior and posterior limbs of the right internal capsule. This finding might improve our understanding of the neural basis of depression and its severity in PD.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Farzaneh Ghazi Sherbaf"", ids = ""133954986""); list(name = ""Kaveh Same"", ids = ""117798093""); list(name = ""Mohammad Hadi Aarabi"", ids = ""2226440"")",dd475e790b659d84a61b40d736631fd30c952551; a41938abe655dc377dd7aaa2f3bb5e4f4431a609; f706650c04e8eb9675b97d37661a2ceb71c04a40,808c580892486375c46ccccad2c4bdb2ee759bc7; 264001d3263bfeeb50857ad769d9711bae38861f; a5272f0f51a49340d360de9bfc2923e6c5c223ed,Acta Neurologica Belgica,118,573-579
82e0a8a8a039c6b5cdc2d892ef67677cffd80c7c,False Discovery Rate and Correction for Multiple Comparisons in Association Genome Screens for Complex Disorders,"There is great current interest in using linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based genome screens to localize genes responsible for common diseases. These screens involve many more markers than traditional linkage studies and therefore present the issue of defining an appropriate significance threshold that takes into account the consequent multiple comparisons. We explore the conceptual and practical implications of adopting the False Discovery Rate (FDR) as a measure of global error in multiple tests for LD-screening. Controlling FDR leads to an increased power to detect more than one locus, making this strategy particularly appealing for complex disease mapping. B ENJAMINI and HOCHBERG(1995) provided a step-wise rule for controlling FDR with independent tests and later proved that it works also for tests that are positive-dependent (B ENJAMINI and YEKUTIELI , 2001). We show analytically and through a simulation study that this rule also effectively controls the FDR for the dependent tests encountered in association mapping from case-control data. Our simulation also emphasizes the increase of power achieved with FDR based procedures over more traditional methods.

070498ab304f721bd3c558e343053b9f04a22f53,Hypergraph Is More Efficient for Storing / Representing Observations and More Informative about the Real Structure of the Data,"This paper addresses the problem of detecting anomalous interactions or traffic within a very large network using a limited number of unlabeled observations. In particular, consider n recorded interactions among p nodes, where p may be very large relative to n. A novel method based on using a hypergraph representation of the data is proposed to deal with this very high-dimensional, â€œbig p, small nâ€ problem. Hypergraphs constitute an important extension of graphs which allows edges to connect more than two vertices simultaneously. An algorithm for detecting anomalies directly on the corresponding discrete space, without any feature selection or dimensionality reduction, is presented. The algorithm has O(np) computational complexity, making it ideally suited for very large networks, and requires no tuning, bandwidth or regularization parameters. The distribution of the data is modeled as a two-component mixture, consisting of a â€œnominalâ€ and an â€œanomalousâ€ component. The deviance of each observation from nominal behavior, as well as the mixture parameters, are learned using ExpectationMaximization (EM), assuming a multivariate Bernoulli variational approximation. This approach is related to probability mass function level set estimation and is shown to allow False Discovery Rate control. The identifiability of the underlying distribution, the local consistency of the EM algorithm, and the avoidance of singular solutions are proved. The proposed approach is validated on high-dimensional synthetic data and it is shown that, for a useful class of data distributions, it can outperform other state-of-the-art methods.",2007,,"list(name = ""Jorge Silva"", ids = ""46529099""); list(name = ""Rebecca Willett"", ids = ""145952380"")",,5f3767b64261b0150b554d8c2e70441d512f63ce; 9cc912ae25797e5f7c0d73300d3968ad8339b411; b4ff28f5225d7c938f1cfbfb799d6b0af98a4be1; ca9cc3e50c4feabedbd9b751efd6745912949ad7; c4f2d0bfb4d541dc85ea96e4f6a0e54396d76ff5; 88816ae492956f3004daa41357166f1181c0c1bf; 0982dea3c583975c875e19fc794d1f4eb328396d; d600f682a8173a4620ceb86d1c997745dc7fd7bf; 00b7d7d6ef41b2ef0f2d1fd07e190c9132b562c6; 0f90ce55b8ebe4d6a0a06be7cdb65f72f449e3a3; 0565604120c84ca3650f5e536a3f09f95d46ee68; 54323bf565cea5d2aaee88a03ec9d1d3444a9bfd; a7e3480cc7f43ec826150f3cf6a2c4c7dc208dd0; 530842bc3328fac3d8fb34a735d9ee0280cc3443; 04ce064505b1635583fa0d9cc07cac7e9ea993cc; aae7c875fc7531233c2a3ebefa31a33f1a0d7f49; e1cc28c0348b6264466fdc761c65231218fe6722; 91d7f28fa5520474aa1f5a7200b3d1515886f2e3; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; e0dc01248f2e19124afaac8f62e3ed2d935d652d; dc08a44d88826a80472c374a287a78376a167fd0; a1345a6a94b10273c2a0246d972f3b961685b702; 14a97fe4116af76e8cefc703144b0a7f0df09b79,,,

7787cf8af227d6d4b4744e3067a191d72bcd697d,FWER and FDR control when testing multiple mediators,"Motivation: The biological pathways linking exposures and disease risk are often poorly understood. To gain insight into these pathways, studies may try to identify biomarkers that mediate the exposure/disease relationship. Such studies often simultaneously test hundreds or thousands of biomarkers. Results: We consider a set of m biomarkers and a corresponding set of null hypotheses, where the jth null hypothesis states that biomarker j does not mediate the exposure/disease relationship. We propose a Multiple Comparison Procedure (MCP) that rejects a set of null hypotheses or, equivalently, identifies a set of mediators, while asymptotically controlling the Familyâ€Wise Error Rate (FWER) or False Discovery Rate (FDR). We use simulations to show that, compared to currently available methods, our proposed method has higher statistical power to detect true mediators. We then apply our method to a breast cancer study and identify nine metabolites that may mediate the known relationship between an increased BMI and an increased risk of breast cancer.

To examine whether loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number variations (CNV) are correlated with clinical characteristics of OSCC, we investigated these genetic aberrations on the genome wide level in a study of 39 OSCC patients. DNA isolated from tumor cells obtained by laser capture microdissection and DNA isolated from paired peripheral lymphocytes were interrogated using Affymetrix 250K NspI arrays. LOH was inferred with Hidden Markov Model (HMM). CNV were inferred using CGH Fused Lasso methods (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.01). Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to test the associations between genetic aberrations and lymph node metastasis and AJCC stage. We observed large inter-individual variation in CNV and LOH profiles among the OSCC patients. The percentage of each genome showing CNV ranged from 16% - 90% (mean Â± sd: 55% Â± 17%). High level of amplification (> 4n) at the cytoband level was observed in up to 23% of the study population; such amplification was most commonly detected at 11q13.2-4 (in more than 15% patients). The percentage of each genome having LOH ranged from 0% - 37% (mean Â± sd: 9% Â± 10%). Greater than 40% of the patients had LOH at chromosome arms 3p, 9p, 11q and 13q. The use of the high resolution array allowed us to identify concurrent LOH and CNV changes that had not been reported previously. Among the 9% autosomal SNP probes showing LOH, 2.1% showed copy number loss, 3.2% showed copy number gain, and the remaining 3.3% were copy neutral LOH. We identified a region of 771 kb in 11q13 that showed both high level copy number amplification and LOH in 26% of the patients; a region of 217 kb in 17q23-q24 that showed copy neutral LOH in 12% patients; and a region of 77 Mb in 3p and 88 kb in 9p21.1 that showed copy number loss LOH in 28% patients. Another novel finding is the association between lymph node metastasis at diagnosis and CNV in a region in 9q34.3 corresponding to the genes KCNT1, CAMSAP1 and UBAC1 (p C15orf15 (p C15orf15 LOH had lymph node metastasis, compared to 25 out of 34 patients without C15orf15 LOH.

Hepatotoxicity is one of the most common drug-related toxicities during the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Many genes involved in liver-specific signaling pathways are tightly controlled by miRNAs, and miRNA function could be modulated by SNPs. As a consequence, we hypothesized that variants in miRNAs could be associated with drug-induced hepatotoxicity.


METHODS
We analyzed 213 SNPs in 206 miRNAs in a cohort of 179 children with ALL homogeneously treated.


RESULTS
rs2648841 in miR-1208 was the most significant SNP during consolidation phase after false discovery rate correction, probably through an effect on its target genes DHFR, MTR and MTHFR.

944c7cd20e5578a5515ac063744fa04643b5d711,Statistical methods for biomarker discovery in proteomics,"Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption and Ionization (SELDI) is a promising proteomic technique for discovering biomarkers. However, the pre-processing of the raw data is still problematic. Integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data may enhance the search for biomarkers, but the current data integration approach results in the loss of large amounts of data. In this thesis, we made improvements to the peak detection step in SELDI by developing the Annotated Regions of Significance (ARS) method. It uses a multi-spectral signal detection method, â€˜Region of Significanceâ€™ (RS), to identify regions with potential biomarkers. RS had better operating characteristics (OC) than existing methods in identifying peaks. Using lung cell line data, at 80% sensitivity, the False Discovery Rates (FDRs) of existing methods were around 25% to 50%, compared to around 8% for RS. ARS extracts a peak template from all spectra in the peak region via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and fits the template to the spectra. A refinement was made to the estimation of the amplitude via a mixture model. Using patient samples from a clinical study, we showed that ARS detected more peaks and gave more accurate peak quantifications than the standard method. We implemented ARS as an R package, ProSpect, and also developed a graphical user interface, ProSpectGUI. Motivated by the performance of ARS in SELDI, we extended ARS to MALDI data with isotopic resolution. The extended ARS utilizes the isotopic pattern to filter out peaks which do not adhere to the expected isotopic pattern. Using the spike-in data, we validated the use of the log-transformed intensities for ARS in MALDI. Compared to the standard method, extended ARS generally had better specificity and was better in quantifying the peaks. At low FDR, extended ARS had higher sensitivity than the standard method. We also contributed to the integration of proteomic and transcriptomic information from the same samples by investigating the use of Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA). The estimates of the gene and protein pattern-pairs from MCA were consistent and biologically congruent, compared to Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (gSVD).

163644b10bea139642a549f313a7d7dc662a530f,P-Values: Misunderstood and Misused,"P-values are widely used in both the social and natural sciences to quantify the statistical significance of observed results. The recent surge of big data research has made the p-value an even more popular tool to test the significance of a study. However, substantial literature has been produced critiquing how p-values are used and understood. In this paper we review this recent critical literature, much of which is routed in the life sciences, and consider its implications for social scientific research. We provide a coherent picture of what the main criticisms are, and draw together and disambiguate common themes. In particular, we explain how the False Discovery Rate is calculated, and how this differs from a p-value. We also make explicit the Bayesian nature of many recent criticisms, a dimension that is often underplayed or ignored. We conclude by identifying practical steps to help remediate some of the concerns identified. We recommend that (i) far lower significance levels are used, such as 0.01 or 0.001, and (ii) p-values are interpreted contextually, and situated within both the findings of the individual study and the broader field of inquiry (through, for example, meta-analyses).",2016,Physics; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Bertie Vidgen"", ids = ""2737827""); list(name = ""Taha Yasseri"", ids = ""1985987"")",935b2ee6b30bc486c5b4dfa4f28fbc277ed28aae; 16fb30372523e6d7c464cd9b3c86ecb2a183cfaa; 7e53a4077df51bd20e7a8423c2b7adfbdf1c777c; 160a6a19a952b80fa0e352d847715e3764594f25; 06e455f4bdc3b73e6c823ea8cc187c75a66e377e; 829b659b475e3eca5beefe83558a4ba594b286f3; 61d5eec74bf473f229dbe5c26199bd68ad17552f; 655df5aef04f64103917835dcbfa3028d4acfdb6; e860d68e1798bbf46715b65c675b31292a4e80f9; b7236d668a8aa8840243bd0258d5c8b1d97bd617; b4c46c1685fd66b265b20dc3fc9a5dbe5b23ba65; c50ef83d3f964803fa44c35db2d76375082dc086; 71d74e8b74ba76d18755999e08579702170c4431; 76cd24bc7ab988abef1ecd4c41d6cf65ba70c5fe,cebb4580a00a291fcf7d30f928c0e90e7689a908; 8765e75b33340b0dc1e05a00b25e864683d3d089; 032eea9e4db1a181fcf8bb82abcf861dfdf74d20; 8f95ee3e19a50adf1772aec986ebb85cd26d2f6f; 4a3b636be7aa8008e8af2364ae974faa31bbd05f; 7c2b0044fb08a19d2eedce2ba8949cda22d888b0; 409accbd9bc19858d666bfb2d2a1a77d43df4a11; a3f96d74bca55ff9d1c82412e64d3f25697be90d; 2cc7be3d5161e865807e13de7975c9d77fbd2815; a18328c638b985530cb12b8b678fc6e6556f7a96; c5ac87df5d6e0e6b6de2f745284835c2a368b0f7; edbdd4d8c8698d538836bb5abffd37b432033d05; 4d02488921e248b8a0cfe70f7d60c0606d3954c4; bcd2a1e2a53751ab3f3d312f0ec6da41a0628451; d91252589a8afa8e788df09bc61566cd29dc0855; b251e0f1a1f2be049f89ce74400bb55b0ea603cd; 34f3b7433e38d5ccffb8643a732935de080657eb; ba7684a2a2b46a1ed9fc5bc0d18bda2de4eb455e; a62d50af8ced5b1da76a044d861e8bef6a4ae4d5; a07a64ba110e0f9f7156f3bd1e376f0d2e1cddf1; bfbcd0d4018f5755e25d65df3ac9ad3552542577; f0fa01e5b242680519b99233082b5afdb9c205cb; 5aada9835d93e361e4e1941ff01352af1e85da8e,ArXiv,abs/1601.06805,
fe5cc20e85246826eab87683a6779e4c1d1f2dd1,Hippocampus and Hypothalamus RNA-sequencing of WFS1-deficient Mice,"Wolfram syndrome is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene. WFS1 protein dysfunction results in a range of neuroendocrine syndromes and is mostly characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. WFS1 has been shown to participate in membrane trafficking, protein processing and Ca2+ homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Aim of the present study was to find the transcriptomic changes influenced by WFS1 in the hypothalamus and hippocampus using RNA-sequencing. The WFS1-deficient mice were used as a model system to analyze the changes in transcriptional networks. The number of differentially expressed genes between hypothalami of WFS1-deficient (Wfs1KO) and wild-type (WT) mice was 43 and between hippocampi 311 with False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05. Avpr1a and Avpr1b were significantly upregulated in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of Wfs1KO mice respectively. Trpm8 was the most upregulated gene in the hippocampus of Wfs1KO mice. The functional analysis revealed significant enrichment of networks and pathways associated with protein synthesis, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, molecular transport, metabolic disease and nervous system development and function. In conclusion, the transcriptomic profiles of WFS1-deficient hypothalamus and hippocampus do indicate the activation of degenerative molecular pathways causing the clinical occurrences typical to Wolfram syndrome.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marilin Ivask"", ids = ""5544944""); list(name = ""Sander Pajusalu"", ids = ""4068089""); list(name = ""Ene Reimann"", ids = ""7605824""); list(name = ""Sulev KÃµks"", ids = ""4095225"")",e585e936670708fb0eb6219c417dfa52a5f5d7da; 69dab99fcb8efd0c3c48a3d4373ff3619fb477e4,,Neuroscience,374,91-103

In the context of our larger study on the effects of bifrontal tDCS on overnight sleep, we analyzed tDCS-modulated resting state wake EEG data for a better understanding of tDCSâ€™s effects on cortical arousal during wakefulness. Methods We applied a standardized tDCS protocol (1Â mA/electrode, 2Â Ã—Â 9Â min cathodal, 2Â Ã—Â 13Â min anodal, 2Â Ã—Â 11Â min sham, with 20Â min inter-stimulation interval each) prior to nighttime sleep bilaterally to the prefrontal cortex (electrodes 5Â Ã—Â 7 cm, FP1/FP2; return electrodes 10Â Ã—Â 10Â cm, P3/P4 ) of 19 healthy subjects in a randomized crossover design. We conducted 5Â min resting state wake EEGs prior to stimulation (T0), after the stimulation (T1) and on the following morning (T2). In a first step of analysis for EEG power differences between conditions at a single frequency, we calculated false discovery rate (FDR) corrected significances, using the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up procedure to assess the significance of the multiple tests. In a second exploratory step, we used uncorrected ANOVAs to further explore tDCS effects on EEG power spectra. Results The FDR-corrected approach did not reveal any significant condition effect. ANOVAs comparing T1 vs. T0 demonstrated a significant decrease in EEG gamma power after cathodal stimulation. A significant main effect for the factor Condition was observed for frequencies of the gamma range. ANOVAs comparing T2 vs. T0 demonstrated a significant increase in EEG gamma power after anodal stimulation and also a significant main effect for the factor Condition for frequencies of the gamma band. Conclusions Exploratory resting state EEG analyses suggested polarity-specific changes in cortical arousal as indexed by resting state EEG power in the gamma frequency range. Cortical gamma activity is considered to emerge from synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory neurons in the cortex and has been linked to the integration of temporally correlated neural events as a prerequisite for attentive wakefulness. It is plausible that depolarization of cortical structures after anodal stimulation facilitates fast-spiking and EEG gamma activity, with reverse effects after cathodal stimulation.",2017,Psychology,"list(name = ""Peter Selhausen"", ids = ""6498032""); list(name = ""Lukas Frase"", ids = ""5052109""); list(name = ""Hannah Piosczyk"", ids = ""2196092""); list(name = ""Friederike Jahn"", ids = ""39415968""); list(name = ""Christoph Nissen"", ids = ""29844263"")",,,Clinical Neurophysiology,128,e106-e107
b09a7d9e09529357fb4102d67ba9f91fde1cd39f,"Identification of male-specific amh duplication, sexually differentially expressed genes and microRNAs at early embryonic development of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)","BackgroundThe probable influence of genes and the environment on sex determination in Nile tilapia suggests that it should be regarded as a complex trait. Detection of sex determination genes in tilapia has both scientific and commercial importance. The main objective was to detect genes and microRNAs that were differentially expressed by gender in early embryonic development.ResultsArtificial fertilization of Oreochromis niloticus XX females with either sex-reversed Î”XX males or genetically-modified YY â€˜supermalesâ€™ resulted in all-female and all-male embryos, respectively. RNA of pools of all-female and all-male embryos at 2, 5 and 9 dpf were used as template for a custom Agilent eArray hybridization and next generation sequencing. Fifty-nine genes differentially expressed between genders were identified by a false discovery rate of pâ€‰<â€‰0.05. The most overexpressed genes were amh and tspan8 in males, and cr/20Î²-hsd, gpa33, rtn4ipl and zp3 in females (pâ€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’9). Validation of gene expression using qPCR in embryos and gonads indicated copy number variation in tspan8, gpa33, cr/20Î²-hsd and amh. Sequencing of amh identified a male-specific duplication of this gene, denoted amhy, differing from the sequence of amh by a 233Â bp deletion on exonVII, hence lacking the capability to encode the protein motif that binds to the transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGF-Î² domain). amh and amhy segregated in the mapping family in full concordance with SD-linked marker on LG23 signifying the QTL for SD. We discovered 831 microRNAs in tilapia embryos of which nine had sexually dimorphic expression patterns by a false discovery rate of pâ€‰<â€‰0.05. An up-regulated microRNA in males, pma-mir-4585, was characterized with all six predicted target genes including cr/20Î²-hsd, down-regulated in males.ConclusionsThis study reports the first discovery of sexually differentially expressed genes and microRNAs at a very early stage of tilapia embryonic development, i.e. from 2 dpf. Genes with sexually differential expression patterns are enriched for copy number variation. A novel male-specific duplication of amh, denoted amhy, lacking the TGF-Î² domain was identified and mapped to the QTL region on LG23 for SD, thus indicating its potential role in SD.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Orly Eshel"", ids = ""6097339""); list(name = ""Andrey Shirak"", ids = ""5584799""); list(name = ""Lior Dor"", ids = ""123401519""); list(name = ""Mark Robert Band"", ids = ""7008536""); list(name = ""Tatyana Zak"", ids = ""39755322""); list(name = ""Michal Markovich-Gordon"", ids = ""1438922393""); list(name = ""Vered Chalifa-Caspi"", ids = ""1390186305""); list(name = ""Esther Feldmesser"", ids = ""32441235""); list(name = ""Joel Ira Weller"", ids = ""3285169""); list(name = ""Eyal Seroussi"", ids = ""2934887""); list(name = ""Gideon Hulata"", ids = ""5099646""); list(name = ""Micha Ron"", ids = ""145705708"")",1d9b8ce74bdb1cd8799a8f4f8fb8bc26328bbebd; 619fb72bb8d19e440627247704c796f444d00ad3; 2bec4a2b8b656c7fc2b8b80285163adf3e1928fd; f3042fd5ab9bbd28359542db4902d853d208edb7; d3b66112f771b5e3bb6a6609254d77f11ad42af4; 0a123dfe9b73d70da615a5fbf4142ed039ef7ce5; 0f1f55ced5c430a433ce32866e7e9a49eecbb379; acfdb331cd292fdce68ade097fd2eab3ffdc7374; 12f4306200cf833943a8464d3c29820c0f71356a; cef12b287dd0fb86379d7848f473fb46548c40e0; b09a7d9e09529357fb4102d67ba9f91fde1cd39f; 2f3eba5df68b846ef63fe5d0f543dcc5a88d1319; 6d7f9d343c8f205178349d6d8e435e441ff0d1e0; 2e5f4ec9cbfa593ff749ccfbad4812f1e7296f82; a25b6d9d648f7f6230a92df13e0034f670b3df68; aee085781f6d9ba9d4c1a10ff8ee145c7b6e1a65; cea0622796325f54ca03ad069fdac28ae07acacb; 46c52d58f4ec1e107fe581735873c8773d9c8ada; 8408e000edd9a706cf7baede9c142e8dea580828; f88eacf483a5970cd6642b484903b31b4fcd6dae; eb51528fa2fb046f28b944d39e39c9a04295c81e; 3cfaad90ec294e7392638231a8ac3026299adafd; a197dfcbb1ac7b789544c32a4e608983d30534e8; 080909da444601ca75cd2dc2f5ff2f783d8ab816; 21bd6d44300a54bee3729cf5e143186cbf578dc3; f39fe29c55a126f20b83a0c325549003b56dc5b3; ba46dd2d51e018514f8531666ceee052e6028b8c,f4b71cd79dcaa1f7e9fc4a87a4ea278bed451610; e66bf9d9da32856eb44f943857ecf1bb659885e1; 31f0b012c56b426be5b2e53a73a6993d9f864198; e3cad3dd64892495aa731b27b44f7a000d8c65a9; 0fcfd4d4b81a9b199a929281e4c71361e4b580c2; f5f3a828c8bff670d09358121c6f9cd6e1c2f373; 1ee80a38f94fc6766b63d643aad4f9cfe6c13367; 2f2fba8ab144b4df364bc1123a7b6a9471946fb5; 17c1e0fb12a20bddeaa8f6941070281d9f62c359; 2fbba1b114438c7521f6674799b846abee240d27; 1f8c4703fdeb439b2f71a5e61cc4a4aad0e37794; d97be5107ac15c7d4a0130b67c7b93d8a92bd73e; 2acbeb46acf8a25120ebc35cfbb1750f20eb072d; 1b07e24f6a7f96680b56c2bbe3c5b9d8f4bc2ac1; 6f1d9d5c1e87a709454513371a09ee901a33dcf0; 3d5b4fbbbc93426bf8a06e0f1d2a9b10032509cc; 54651951d21700b335abb827b729a4b9ab550478; c5fdbd1b0642e55f1872336dd13862027ed33aee; d07bd40d88bf5f714afb493c24deb9c768329104; 85ace315e035f7501d4a149af358dd774fa2d616; 68b6486636977ea049c422d325587d51892f188e; d59705dc39badc28e8226b09f5a071d5a30c2742; a5134023648ced35293eb1a0914ef8cebf1930ae; 81f60640a805a019d9e6f3f68f20009c275b41df; 35c65231feb6743ae10c3d7cc7cc0595e6b556a5; b09a7d9e09529357fb4102d67ba9f91fde1cd39f; 4738fafa72a97c8b64e1ac74fdcf76e9cd6f6b7b; da446b08be37a49bb42d4476193a5f093b7b0c17; c81a5f7469419748daff6272230ed330001ee8f2; 26a8148eb3639e3e3fcba675eea7902a61074447; b200649be9d58f8b0808b8da7360e90d066fe526; acc8084d4f22a38343ccf9955e175a55442fd7fe; 0544d8fd3a58212a79ee16f6c39959a6d9c69928; 7ec0f66cd7b6988f7215b3dac9b11abad7f85a85; fc81e4cb00e4485744685e594e0fc2aca62a692d; 3a28886599ec2848cf46eebf05f1b2ac5fa7bd17; ea7c47ae0a241c440fa02742521609603c660459; 4571deec85c350fb738c816e4631978c79d247ea; 7fc0ff91d75f22cc7fc28a271009a6badc263976; 32b147e8553f5b9ae5df9f296b2352fd8e3b1783; 862b99b7c392b3e3e9549cfbb9cdb822e93c517f; 858d3409d582c639ac74647b16b6da638d4bb15c; 914bae75945d34c1e7ba936ab4c96b3cd21dd7eb; 2b0a63ca0b29fb5a4c55c248459342ea179f9e74; b7e8d40a35cbbb053f56763337d7572230b4a3fb; 68d4c362fd444bacb6186eda2519fd0591e0beb4; 942b4459142c66379f09b41f3799d8a807320096; 59386e74cc44518a0d302dbe51999f3614755559; 34dfafae6769689af8fe7e86da83b76a5fa90537; b01974fd8c6c8ffc92fe1e4b8eb27806cdc6181f; 05e7c9c64dd623f7f73be16f527b264f4e6edbeb; 7d5f6f75f8649ba797ead93321c44e054ff643e0; b458ff50973dfe0b1d384a0fb27424ad2f150844; 66a378cf012d384ad5bad8a37aa93f8aae60f4f6; 70cc60be9ec36be67541eb1a38327adef6c60449; 0d05edb9e315854927ce72df6dc988f1bc86b5ff; ee7863a0c70bb2025b4ae107b45150da4b97eba9; 846060ba6875328c51d0f990750f3156fe9be46a; 3bd402e54fe1e7da372f746d15ac9e28a8e14429; 2112b7baecc18239f5c20b699c43c79598ac6596; cbc53a437d33da9ee01ca3b952d5d91ae8066e2c; d150bb2a726e8c2f6410716a7f63339978ea604c; 4476b44a22156a6ab4a4c659cacc5859b70901e0; 318fd3775ac2d9f30978751e47230318d8041afe; 66b20beb2bddb768900b570a3c0abc8202e6e681; e7c9998df63fa8cdb2b150b988606df4fc26844e; 53d90866b47b9c0f1ec60f79518943a08d12279c,BMC Genomics,15,

In this chapter, we consider molecular biology studies generating huge dimensional data. Microarray studies are typical examples, so that we state this chapter in terms of gene microarray data, but the discussed methods can be used for design and analysis of any molecular biology studies involving high-dimensional data. In this chapter, we discuss sample size calculation methods for molecular biology studies when the discovery of prognostic molecular markers is performed by accurately controlling false discovery rate (FDR) or family-wise error rate (FWER) in the final data analysis.

34e3153c3ff614ab745de234e6c35043c5b37b47,"Automated Analysis of Quantitative Image Data Using Isomorphic Functional Mixed Models, with Application to Proteomics Data.","Image data are increasingly encountered and are of growing importance in many areas of science. Much of these data are quantitative image data, which are characterized by intensities that represent some measurement of interest in the scanned images. The data typically consist of multiple images on the same domain and the goal of the research is to combine the quantitative information across images to make inference about populations or interventions. In this paper, we present a unified analysis framework for the analysis of quantitative image data using a Bayesian functional mixed model approach. This framework is flexible enough to handle complex, irregular images with many local features, and can model the simultaneous effects of multiple factors on the image intensities and account for the correlation between images induced by the design. We introduce a general isomorphic modeling approach to fitting the functional mixed model, of which the wavelet-based functional mixed model is one special case. With suitable modeling choices, this approach leads to efficient calculations and can result in flexible modeling and adaptive smoothing of the salient features in the data. The proposed method has the following advantages: it can be run automatically, it produces inferential plots indicating which regions of the image are associated with each factor, it simultaneously considers the practical and statistical significance of findings, and it controls the false discovery rate. Although the method we present is general and can be applied to quantitative image data from any application, in this paper we focus on image-based proteomic data. We apply our method to an animal study investigating the effects of opiate addiction on the brain proteome. Our image-based functional mixed model approach finds results that are missed with conventional spot-based analysis approaches. In particular, we find that the significant regions of the image identified by the proposed method frequently correspond to subregions of visible spots that may represent post-translational modifications or co-migrating proteins that cannot be visually resolved from adjacent, more abundant proteins on the gel image. Thus, it is possible that this image-based approach may actually improve the realized resolution of the gel, revealing differentially expressed proteins that would not have even been detected as spots by modern spot-based analyses.",2011,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey S.

525563ba0f55ceebeb1c7e55c863463375e11646,Transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing analysis of rat skeletal muscle feed arteries. I. Impact of obesity.,"We employed next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology to determine the influence of obesity on global gene expression in skeletal muscle feed arteries. Transcriptional profiles of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle feed arteries (GFA and SFA, respectively) and aortic endothelial cell-enriched samples from obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) and lean Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were examined. Obesity produced 282 upregulated and 133 downregulated genes in SFA and 163 upregulated and 77 downregulated genes in GFA [false discovery rate (FDR) < 10%] with an overlap of 93 genes between the arteries. In LETO rats, there were 89 upregulated and 114 downregulated genes in the GFA compared with the SFA. There were 244 upregulated and 275 downregulated genes in OLETF rats (FDR < 10%) in the GFA compared with the SFA, with an overlap of 76 differentially expressed genes common to both LETO and OLETF rats in both the GFA and SFA. A total of 396 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between LETO and OLETF in aortic endothelial cell-enriched samples. Overall, we found 1) the existence of heterogeneity in the transcriptional profile of the SFA and GFA within healthy LETO rats, 2) that this between-vessel heterogeneity was markedly exacerbated in the hyperphagic, obese OLETF rat, and 3) a greater number of genes whose expression was altered by obesity in the SFA compared with the GFA. Also, results indicate that in OLETF rats the GFA takes on a relatively more proatherogenic phenotype compared with the SFA.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nathan T Jenkins"", ids = ""6538652""); list(name = ""Jaume Padilla"", ids = ""145202103""); list(name = ""Pamela K.

f68311a87998b2a2ff5044572ea47422129442dc,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with fatigue in primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE
Chronic fatigue is a common, disabling and poorly understood phenomenon. Recent studies indicate that epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the expression of fatigue, a prominent feature of primary SS (pSS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether DNA methylation profiles of whole blood are associated with fatigue in patients with pSS.


METHODS
Forty-eight pSS patients with high (n = 24) or low (n = 24) fatigue as measured by a visual analogue scale were included. Genome-wide DNA methylation was investigated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. After quality control, a total of 383 358 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites remained for further analysis. Age, sex and differential cell count estimates were included as covariates in the association model. A false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05 was considered significant, and a cut-off of 3% average difference in methylation levels between high- and low-fatigue patients was applied.


RESULTS
A total of 251 differentially methylated CpG sites were associated with fatigue. The CpG site with the most pronounced hypomethylation in pSS high fatigue annotated to the SBF2-antisense RNA1 gene. The most distinct hypermethylation was observed at a CpG site annotated to the lymphotoxin alpha gene. Functional pathway analysis of genes with differently methylated CpG sites in subjects with high vs low fatigue revealed enrichment in several pathways associated with innate and adaptive immunity.


CONCLUSION
Some genes involved in regulation of the immune system and in inflammation are differently methylated in pSS patients with high vs low fatigue. These findings point to functional networks that may underlie fatigue. Epigenetic changes could constitute a fatigue-regulating mechanism in pSS.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Katrine BrÃ¦kke Norheim"", ids = ""12682303""); list(name = ""J Imgenberg-Kreuz"", ids = ""1401589357""); list(name = ""Kristin Jonsdottir"", ids = ""46300418""); list(name = ""Emiel A.

We sought to define metabolites that differ between intensive care unit (ICU) patients that did or did not survive hospitalization. Methods: Subjects matched on demographics and nutrient administration in a RCT on glutamine supplementation in surgical ICU patients were selected based on hospital mortality. Serial plasma was analyzed using high-resolution LC-MS methods. False discovery rate (FDR; q=0.05) and hierarchal cluster analysis was used to distinguish accurate mass ions (metabolites) significantly different between groups. The METLIN Metabolite Database was used to match ions to known metabolites. Results: A total of 22,305 metabolites were detected (54, 5, 33, and 113 were significantly different between the two groups at days 0, 3, 7, and 14, respectively).

The proposed non-parametric procedure uses order-restricted inference to compare gene expressions among ordered experimental conditions. The null distribution for determining significance is derived by suitably bootstrapping the residuals. The procedure addresses two potential sources of correlation in the data, namely, (a) correlations among genes within a chip (""intra-chip"" correlation), and (b) correlation within subject due to repeated/longitudinal measurements (""temporal"" correlation). To make the procedure computationally efficient, the adaptive bootstrap methodology of Guo and Peddada (2008) is implemented such that the resulting procedure controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level.",2010,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shyamal D.

f41bab576d37a81205f0dc4c1d39780c1bb97137,Small GTPase Immunity-Associated Proteins Mediate Resistance to Toxoplasma gondii Infection in Lewis Rat.,"Rats vary in their susceptibilities to Toxoplasma gondii infection depending on the rat strain. Compared to the T. gondii-susceptible Brown Norway (BN) rat, the Lewis (LEW) rat is extremely resistant to T. gondii Thus, these two rat strains are ideal models for elucidating host mechanisms that are important for host resistance to T. gondii infection. Therefore, in our efforts to unravel molecular factors directing the protective early innate immune response in the LEW rat, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of the LEW versus BN rat with or without T. gondii infection. We identified three candidate small GTPase immunity-associated proteins (GIMAPs) that were upregulated (false discovery rate, 0.05) in the LEW rat in response to T. gondii infection. Subsequently, we engineered T. gondii-susceptible NR8383 rat macrophage cells for overexpression of LEW rat-derived candidate GIMAP 4, 5, and 6. By immunofluorescence analysis we observed that GIMAP 4, 5, and 6 in T. gondii-infected NR8383 cells each colocalized with GRA5, a parasite parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) marker protein, suggesting their translocation to the PVM. Interestingly, overexpression of each candidate GIMAP in T. gondii-infected NR8383 cells induced translocation of LAMP1, a lysosome marker protein, to the T. gondii surface membrane. Importantly, overexpression of GIMAP 4, 5, or 6 individually inhibited intracellular T. gondii growth, with GIMAP 4 having the highest inhibitory effect. Together, our findings indicate that upregulation of GIMAP 4, 5, and 6 contributes to the robust refractoriness of the LEW rat to T. gondii through induction of lysosomal fusion to the otherwise nonfusogenic PVM.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chi Yong Kim"", ids = ""14073019""); list(name = ""Xuejin Zhang"", ids = ""47958518""); list(name = ""William Harold Witola"", ids = ""4145604"")",2e1d4c57bfde672ec6a0e1051d22bdac24fdcfb1; 35835c64972e8eee6d50f29bac90fb2b12481392; ba2e302faa8d39434e2b7c5e24857223266f5de9,,Infection and immunity,86 4,

The Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) procedure has since been adopted for use in reporting results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), as well as in other research applications. This short note illustrates that the B-H procedure is extremely simple to implement using widely available spreadsheet software.

7c00a465fb74d0c1adc97e44614e1d0aba6d6deb,Abstract P2-10-03: A cross-platform comparison of genomic signatures and OncotypeDx score to discover potential prognostic/predictive genes and pathways,"Background: Microarray assessment of breast cancer demonstrates disease subsets among the major breast cancer biologic categories (ER, PR, HER-2) with likely additional prognostic and treatment (predictive) implications. Additional prognostic and predictive biomarkers and optimization of existing genomic platforms are needed to improve personalized breast cancer care. Methods: 76 early-stage ER+ patients with adequate RNA from fresh frozen tumor specimens and a concurrent 21-gene OncotypeDX recurrence score (RS) were identified across independent Duke studies linked to routine prospective breast biospecimen collection. Expression estimates for Affymetrix H133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were reviewed for quality control (Owzar 2008) and normalized across 4 batches with ComBat. Correlations of genomic prognostic signatures to true RS were assessed using Spearman coefficients. Discovery of new gene-level and pathway-level associations to breast cancer prognosis and prediction, based on RS, were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferonni for the family-wise error rate (FWER) or Benjamini-Hochberg methods for the false discovery rate (FDR). Results: A total of 73 samples passed Affymetrix quality control: 32 â€œlow riskâ€, 32 â€œintermediate riskâ€, and 9 â€œhigh riskâ€ using standard recurrence score thresholds of 30. Median patient age is 55 (range 35â€“86). Two published algorithms to impute the RS from the Affymetrix model by Fan and Haibe-Keins were highly concordant (94%) with each other and showed strong correlation to actual RS (rho = 0.62, p = 5eâˆ’9). However, when the RS thresholds were applied to the microarray-based scores, lower agreement was observed (misclassification rate of 57%). Strong correlation was also observed with other breast signatures and RS, including an imputed 70-gene signature of MammaPrint (rho = 0.59, p = 3eâˆ’8) and the 50-gene PAM50 risk-of-relapse score (rho = 0.54, p = 8eâˆ’7), while poor correlation was seen for the GENIUS prognostic model (rho = 0.06, p = 0.6). Discovery of gene-level associations to RS identified 28 genes, including known cancer-associated genes such as BRCA2 (FWER adj p = 0.002), Cyclin E1 (FWER adj p = 0.015), and CDCA5 (FWER adj p = 0.048). Pathway-level association in KEGG and GO Biologic Processes, identified 24 and 104 categories respectively, including Cell Cycle pathways KEGG:04110 (FDR adj p = 0.002) and GO:0000085 (FDR adj p = 0.0007). Among 22 in-vitro derived oncogenic pathway signatures, significant negative correlation is seen with p53 (rho = âˆ’0.56, adj p = 4eâˆ’6) and positive correlation with beta-catenin (rho = 0.38, adj p = 0.015). A multi-gene model of association to OncotypeDX RS classification is being developed using Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM). Conclusions: Microarray-based prognostic breast cancer signatures are generally concordant. However, their application across platforms is currently sub-optimal. In the context of OncotypeDX RS, additional key cancer-associated genes and pathways are found to be associated with breast cancer prognosis, potentially providing insight into treatment opportunities for ER+ breast cancer. Validation efforts of these findings in an independent patient cohort are underway.

Therefore, it is difficult to reliably estimate the FDR when p-values are discrete or based on one-sided tests. Results:A simple and robustmethod to estimate the FDR is proposed. The proposed method does not rely on implicit assumptions that tests are two-sided or yield continuously distributed p-values. The proposed method is proven to be conservative and have desirable large-sample properties. In addition, the proposed method was among the best performers across a series of â€˜real data simulationsâ€™ comparing the performance of five currently available methods.

In hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH), E2 attenuates lung vascular remodeling through estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent effects; however, ER target genes in the hypoxic lung remain unknown. In order to identify the genome regulated by the E2-ER axis in the hypoxic lung, we performed a microarray analysis in lungs from HPH rats treated with E2 (75â€‰mcg/kg/day) Â± ER-antagonist ICI182,780 (3â€‰mg/kg/day). Untreated HPH rats and normoxic rats served as controls. Using a false discovery rate of 10%, we identified a significantly differentially regulated genome in E2-treated versus untreated hypoxia rats. Genes most upregulated by E2 encoded matrix metalloproteinase 8, S100 calcium binding protein A8, and IgA Fc receptor; genes most downregulated by E2 encoded olfactory receptor 63, secreted frizzled-related protein 2, and thrombospondin 2. Several genes affected by E2 changed in the opposite direction after ICI182,780 co-treatment, indicating an ER-regulated genome in HPH lungs. The bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Grem1 (gremlin 1) was upregulated by hypoxia, but found to be among the most downregulated genes after E2 treatment. Gremlin 1 protein was reduced in E2-treated versus untreated hypoxic animals, and ER-blockade abolished the inhibitory effect of E2 on Grem1 mRNA and protein. In conclusion, E2 ER-dependently regulates several genes involved in proliferative and inflammatory processes during hypoxia. Gremlin 1 is a novel target of the E2-ER axis in HPH. Understanding the mechanisms of E2 gene regulation in HPH may allow for selectively harnessing beneficial transcriptional activities of E2 for therapeutic purposes.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrea L.

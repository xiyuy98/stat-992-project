However, the transcriptome profile in peripheral blood under hypoxia is still unidentified. The present work aimed to explore the transcriptional profile alteration of peripheral blood in chronic hypoxia. Methods The present study used a chronic hypoxia rat model to simulate the hypoxic state of CCHD patients. Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6 per group) were either exposed to hypoxia (10% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) for 3 weeks. Body weight was measured weekly. Peripheral blood was collected and total RNA was extracted for RNA-Seq at the end of the hypoxia treatment. After quality assessment, the library was sequenced by the Illumina Hiseq platform. The differentially expressed genes were screened (false discovery rate<0.05 and fold change>2). The functional annotation analysis and cluster analysis of differentially expressed genes were performed based on the adjusted P-value (padj<0.05). Results Compared with the control group, the body weight of the rats in the hypoxia group was significantly lowered (P<0.01). RNA-Seq results showed that the transcriptome patterns of the two groups had significant differences. In total, 872 genes were identified as differentially expressed. Among all, 803 genes were down-regulated, while only 69 genes were up-regulated in the hypoxia group. The functional enrichment analysis of the 872 genes showed that multiple biological processes involved, such as porphyrin-containing compound metabolic process, hemoglobin complex and oxygen transporter activity. Conclusions Our study demonstrated the transcriptional profile alteration in peripheral blood of chronic hypoxia rat model. This study provided basic data and directions to further understand the physiological and pathological changes in patients with CCHD.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ting Ting Wang"", ids = ""48470139""); list(name = ""Jun Yue Xing"", ids = ""1638296725""); list(name = ""Liuguang Zhang"", ids = ""31439258""); list(name = ""Hao Zhang"", ids = ""21766289"")",,bee949ba15f695cd1aca6878d2c10f7cad7e221e; e1028aa59f1a6206d625c95db3c2c18e72e53cbb; c222fdc7e372682d65e97881afd67684f7aea056; 9b76cdeeb0f94df829a8207250a5ed4070138ec1; 879471eb9913bc92bcb93331a033037299f69d1b; 8af3d4e77ab56780b39e43968edd0dd37b57f111; 8303da9cd4acbba205672bf121af7e329f7356d5; 164b3127151350ce57c8fefe8b06e28a67fec806; 1fd9971fc44e70f9df662e5f46e4e49a90af373c; 01dfe4ebac443cffa2e34b60425e8526a2de0938; 25f62520b6c7f88c17d4489837b538c7576b90cf; dd1075aea3927ca68305cce6faffc531a0ec65d0; b3777c4b2eeb5d934f975df2fca41ad65ed85499; 9d4c7f871f1574d87670d32edc0b6629b69fe540; 828cdb6f32db3391f41e0d3e46343176188507af; d6c2bb532b51b77068451b7afb1a79e245c9618f; b6418a643a211c68fc1cafcf9b6f18ade6b83a3d; e9407608b8955003e5a5d00c3bc7816d73d62922; f92a3e423f1b5167e899c18a9909435d3ccacd06; 639812743a8435700ccd4ed722424bd8e0a9cbb0; 5cc2227d9bd0f5d7fb6faf02c50c69852f5cff34; b8bde3a70cf7b66c12ea63049792b47224a6a1d7; 9bf71062a5ac84354d71b3f544e1b2e2b7eab209; f38c0abe442229771674f0e4ceae7e66fe0fdbb2; 8fc7865a17fee4f6185049113273de3ff72554e8; bc8e4d516cf54ba0e2efb7ac5abd876fc18626ca; f2737176629956843c59cfb854a744b3105c5b43; 6aa5e3c02ca44d11e423d8193cb01c57deee719e; 0e8145879427b8381e7fd5851fd17f0adc23f9a1; c7d0dc461b269c43904260f620539b5fc21f91f4; f34492fa8db0e210163cc53808c502730f9f1ea0; b4090c8ba7c9e36915e79ee3618a1a6bf5a5b31f; 5a8aabd3906a9166212bcbac04608a1b2306de42; 1f10c3ef09009496bdff43ee1f87fccfe6418f99; 21fc48800aeabc546c3b6972ce2381ed35283e77; 60d2d5a65dd13b1b2406c9d946814f31cebb3a79; 62b3c7df7c89c23ac12dc45bfccee36884796f1e; 9aa8da9b2a3c4a0c5c907694b5cbac61fcbd76c6; 5647379055012355c05a4a4bdbd21a14294a20e9; a6aeb0a19081ee84018c7ee14ac75fe3b4014db6; 32b0201c7ff0764d5d10637eff0b8860d43ecfaa; b5e95ea71a6474d9f212f7c8e7bdefbfb3022731; 21217ec2311cf1fcc96f2790b77ad8eca1993e55; 3420eceed2879a8fbc67330601d1eb5ed09488aa; a44fb8b4f2ea81f435668373d2fc4224de6f8ba8; 4a396ea624acfe7a997251da4bc440b57e321a54; d797477a9cb481f9b77b7a43b18c950917de3bd1; 5718b684dfc6fb87109117ace6e79b4a4b655a35; dd34d2326c233e52000d40e1e0ede79a7ebe2d09; 8c90efc2a17e747c0dd1520d792b3cddfa88c793; 830fdb7b17cfa7b96693c41f04416c05ccbf34e6; 28fc9944d59eef3ec8798fdc3a1f48084444b1f6; 94e148745ba9b09b72a4a493a4926d2ec3b00fb4; 91eb6b944e6cbe486bdcef2b4211a3a6d890905c; 027aca287c831226dfa66cdb4c9e0cbef08e63d6; 8ce04f16dca0d69836f695453390689e0c4ef453; 5c3de24fbfef55f7948842ad70da20515b72ed87; 9c8991748af2c59c6c87a044cec7f2a9af9eab45; 355bdda17d78de851ab9b666221391852d206787; 8569bcb474f1d93ed5dfe9ce5f89440bab610c23; e06722a14988633beb5ac0f924ad7947f7345933; 555b8de9f1eb5f970da088e4e03bac6afe789294; 0bbda4ed49fc1a3c2d4f0085f8ed12e98ced0018,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,35 1,"

94369b2d6adde6f4c192ddbebdb84e3751d809c6,A new estimation of protein-level false discovery rate,"BackgroundIn mass spectrometry-based proteomics, protein identification is an essential task. Evaluating the statistical significance of the protein identification result is critical to the success of proteomics studies. Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) is the most common method for assuring the overall quality of the set of identifications. Existing FDR estimation methods either rely on specific assumptions or rely on the two-stage calculation process of first estimating the error rates at the peptide-level, and then combining them somehow at the protein-level. We propose to estimate the FDR in a non-parametric way with less assumptions and to avoid the two-stage calculation process.ResultsWe propose a new protein-level FDR estimation framework. The framework contains two major components: the Permutation+BH (Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg) FDR estimation method and the logistic regression-based null inference method. In Permutation+BH, the null distribution of a sample is generated by searching data against a large number of permuted random protein database and therefore does not rely on specific assumptions. Then, p-values of proteins are calculated from the null distribution and the BH procedure is applied to the p-values to achieve the relationship of the FDR and the number of protein identifications. The Permutation+BH method generates the null distribution by the permutation method, which is inefficient for online identification. The logistic regression model is proposed to infer the null distribution of a new sample based on existing null distributions obtained from the Permutation+BH method.ConclusionsIn our experiment based on three public available datasets, our Permutation+BH method achieves consistently better performance than MAYU, which is chosen as the benchmark FDR calculation method for this study. The null distribution inference result shows that the logistic regression model achieves a reasonable result both in the shape of the null distribution and the corresponding FDR estimation result.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Guanying Wu"", ids = ""91169264""); list(name = ""Xiang Wan"", ids = ""144830138""); list(name = ""Baohua Xu"", ids = ""32782513"")",,9c9ae9373b3684b165aae1015c2b7cd5f3840bd6; 91c0b9d15f41833c21492a1fb61e65ec8d29e213; 48793da33eb98e14f8da2d35486eb68f31e14b6e; 6150801e4a272197021161d369d63436a6aa7655; abc068774c25d1e85c6c58bf9a9ad01d9fea2a77; f89be3aa29635b1e7f6c8bb40d9aa81acaf41fa5; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; ccdb9ceadb264e039f5dddc14bab12272065543e; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; a99eade401bcbda62707d2fff0b52d69ff45f532; 72f6efb41bdf5cd47fe3b9a1353b484a0358aa07; c90be9508cd2c56d6e04c6c708fe8a866639a1be; 4fcc10e43a25159a631caedc4d5008af7dd9340b; 1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; 770a434f16248dd02ca2c3f2cdc059ee0e7d3543; 987718b23ff0c27c0cd99702ede5bbfd52b2ee93; 0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 663f6c710585195a7e26ad9ee7e8065c75c270ac,BMC Genomics,19,
d028d51f6795d747208ca60704854c5bf4a0d680,Genetic association analyses of PDYN polymorphisms with heroin and cocaine addiction.,"Genetic factors are believed to account for 30-50% of the risk for cocaine and heroin addiction. Dynorphin peptides, derived from the prodynorphin (PDYN) precursor, bind to opioid receptors, preferentially the kappa-opioid receptor, and may mediate the aversive effects of drugs of abuse. Dynorphin peptides produce place aversion in animals and produce dysphoria in humans. Cocaine and heroin have both been shown to increase expression of PDYN in brain regions relevant for drug reward and use. Polymorphisms in PDYN are therefore hypothesized to increase risk for addiction to drugs of abuse. In this study, 3 polymorphisms in PDYN (rs1022563, rs910080 and rs1997794) were genotyped in opioid-addicted [248 African Americans (AAs) and 1040 European Americans (EAs)], cocaine-addicted (1248 AAs and 336 EAs) and control individuals (674 AAs and 656 EAs). Sex-specific analyses were also performed as a previous study identified PDYN polymorphisms to be more significantly associated with female opioid addicts. We found rs1022563 to be significantly associated with opioid addiction in EAs [P = 0.03, odds ratio (OR) = 1.31; false discovery rate (FDR) corrected q-value]; however, when we performed female-specific association analyses, the OR increased from 1.31 to 1.51. Increased ORs were observed for rs910080 and rs199774 in female opioid addicts also in EAs. No statistically significant associations were observed with cocaine or opioid addiction in AAs. These data show that polymorphisms in PDYN are associated with opioid addiction in EAs and provide further evidence that these risk variants may be more relevant in females.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""T-K Clarke"", ids = ""49692083""); list(name = ""Lisa M.

29557bdce6f46f79fd21e1842157127efec80125,Integration of Murine and Human Studies for Mapping Periodontitis Susceptibility,"Periodontitis is one of the most common inflammatory human diseases with a strong genetic component. Due to the limited sample size of available periodontitis cohorts and the underlying trait heterogeneity, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of chronic periodontitis (CP) have largely been unsuccessful in identifying common susceptibility factors. A combination of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in mice with association studies in humans has the potential to discover novel risk loci. To this end, we assessed alveolar bone loss in response to experimental periodontal infection in 25 lines (286 mice) from the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population using microâ€“computed tomography (ÂµCT) analysis. The orthologous human chromosomal regions of the significant QTL were analyzed for association using imputed genotype data (OmniExpress BeadChip arrays) derived from case-control samples of aggressive periodontitis (AgP; 896 cases, 7,104 controls) and chronic periodontitis (CP; 2,746 cases, 1,864 controls) of northwest European and European American descent, respectively. In the mouse genome, QTL mapping revealed 2 significant loci (â€“log P = 5.3; false discovery rate = 0.06) on chromosomes 1 (Perio3) and 14 (Perio4). The mapping resolution ranged from ~1.5 to 3 Mb. Perio3 overlaps with a previously reported QTL associated with residual bone volume in F2 cross and includes the murine gene Ccdc121. Its human orthologue showed previously a nominal significant association with CP in humans. Use of variation data from the genomes of the CC founder strains further refined the QTL and suggested 7 candidate genes (CAPN8, DUSP23, PCDH17, SNORA17, PCDH9, LECT1, and LECT2). We found no evidence of association of these candidates with the human orthologues. In conclusion, the CC populations enabled mapping of confined QTL that confer susceptibility to alveolar bone loss in mice and larger human phenotype-genotype samples and additional expression data from gingival tissues are likely required to identify true positive signals.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Aysar Nashef"", ids = ""6823962""); list(name = ""R Qabaja"", ids = ""32072534""); list(name = ""Yaser Salaymeh"", ids = ""32500837""); list(name = ""Maya Botzman"", ids = ""2251260""); list(name = ""Matthias Munz"", ids = ""46779788""); list(name = ""Henrik Dommisch"", ids = ""5976263""); list(name = ""Bastian Krone"", ids = ""34690863""); list(name = ""Per Hoffmann"", ids = ""145776892""); list(name = ""Juergen Wellmann"", ids = ""3765343""); list(name = ""Matthias Laudes"", ids = ""34298674""); list(name = ""Klaus Berger"", ids = ""144234305""); list(name = ""Thomas Kocher"", ids = ""144136679""); list(name = ""Bruno G.

6ac2d56a44cd1a607aac0b536294bebd362faa43,Technical note: Use of laser capture microdissection for the localization of tissue-specific global gene expression in rumen papillae.,"Gene expression profiling of bovine rumen tissue has provided insight into dietary regulation of rumen epithelial function. However, most studies have relied on a heterogeneous sample with multiple tissue and cell types. The objective of this study was to use laser capture microdissection to characterize RNA expression profiling of epithelial and connective tissues of rumen papillae. Papillae were biopsied from 3 lactating dairy cows, frozen in cryomolds, cut into sections, stained, and dehydrated, and epithelial and connective cells were collected using laser capture microdissection. Total RNA was isolated from epithelial and connective tissue and global gene expression was assessed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Data preprocessing was conducted using the robust multi-array average method, and detection of differentially expressed genes (DEG) was determined using ANOVA. The model included the fixed effect of tissue, and a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.1 was applied to DEG. We found 382 DEG between epithelial and connective tissues. Analysis of these DEG using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Redwood City, CA) found that epithelial and connective tissues in rumen papillae expressed distinct RNA profiles (signatures). The epithelial signature was enriched with RNA encoding tight junction and metabolic genes, whereas connective signatures were enriched with RNA encoding proteins involved in cell structure and extracellular matrix composition. The molecular functions enriched within the top networks between the 2 tissues from the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis included connective tissue disorders, dermatological diseases and conditions, gastrointestinal disease, tissue morphology, and tissue development. In summary, it is possible to use laser capture microdissection for the localization of tissue-specific global gene expression in rumen papillae. This approach may be useful to improve the accuracy and interpretation of molecular measurements in future studies.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael A Steele"", ids = ""40323214""); list(name = ""O.

1fd924ec69b841da6ecb1117dcfd8f83c9a53f72,Maternal obesity and the human milk metabolome: associations with infant body composition and postnatal weight gain.,"BACKGROUND
Maternal obesity is a risk factor for childhood obesity; this is a major public health concern given that âˆ¼40% of pregnant women are either overweight or obese. Whether differences in milk composition in lean compared with obese women contribute to childhood obesity is unclear.


OBJECTIVES
We aimed to analyze relationships between maternal obesity and human milk metabolites, infant body composition, and postnatal weight gain.


METHODS
This was a prospective study in which mothers intending to breastfeed exclusively, and their newborn infants, were enrolled at delivery (nÂ =Â 35 mother-infant pairs). We excluded mothers with diabetes, other medical conditions, or pregnancy complications. Participants were grouped by maternal prepregnancy BMI <25 (lean) or â‰¥25 kg/m2 (overweight/obese). We analyzed infant body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and used untargeted liquid chromatography-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure the milk content of 275 metabolites at 1 and 6 mo postpartum.


RESULTS
At 1 mo postpartum, 10 metabolites differed between overweight/obese and lean groups with nominal PÂ <Â 0.05, but none was altered with a false discovery rate <0.25. Many differentially abundant metabolites belonged to the same chemical class; e.g., 4/10 metabolites were nucleotide derivatives, and 3/10 were human milk oligosaccharides. Milk adenine correlated positively with both continuously distributed maternal BMI and with infant adiposity and fat accrual. Analysis of milk composition at 6 mo postpartum revealed 20 differentially abundant metabolites (PÂ <Â 0.05) in overweight/obese compared with lean women, including 6 metabolites with a false discovery rate of <0.25. At both 1 and 6 mo, human milk abundance of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, which has not previously been described in milk, was positively associated with maternal BMI.


CONCLUSIONS
Maternal obesity is associated with changes in the human milk metabolome. While only a subset of metabolites correlated with both maternal and infant weight, these point to potential milk-dependent mechanisms for mother-child transmission of obesity.

a89d390aaffc000103f664bee85c2f5ab3bac118,Association between SREBF2 gene polymorphisms and metabolic syndrome in clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND
Patients with schizophrenia using antipsychotics often develop metabolic side effects, especially with clozapine. Previous studies indicated that antipsychotics could activate the pathway of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). The sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2) gene mainly regulates the cholesterol biosynthetic gene. Therefore, we hypothesized that the SREBF2 gene would be a candidate gene for interindividual variation in drug-induced metabolic syndrome (MetS). In this genetic case-control study, we examined the SREBF2 gene polymorphisms in the risk of MetS patients treated with clozapine.


METHODS
Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SREBF2 were genotyped in a CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China) population, a sample of 621 schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine. Patients were evaluated for metabolic parameters and screened for the MetS criteria.


RESULTS
The incidence of MetS among all subjects was 41.8% (260/621). Two markers of SREBF2 were associated with MetS induced by clozapine after False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction (rs1052717, corrected Pallele=0.010, corrected Pgenotype=0.022; and rs2267443, corrected Pgenotype=0.015). Patients who received clozapine and carried the A-allele of rs2267443 or rs1052717 had an increased risk of MetS (rs2267443, odds ratio (OR)=1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-2.34; and rs1052717, OR=1.81, 95% CI: 1.15-1.98), adjusted by logistic regression for clinical characteristics.


CONCLUSION
The results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms of SREBF2 gene may be associated with MetS in patients treated with clozapine.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lin Yang"", ids = ""40248928""); list(name = ""Jianhua Chen"", ids = ""49252513""); list(name = ""Dengtang Liu"", ids = ""66953962""); list(name = ""Shunying Yu"", ids = ""6802123""); list(name = ""Yifeng Xu"", ids = ""2720256"")",a5462b402c38605f91d2a7eabb229f584643fbc2; 022bc77caea6f244ef707c1773d3e978b47c4807; 10b4f1074a3eab5e0f6a94e8375abd423e542522; 51602d49aafcdf89f1be7804d38fa889c9c1f610; ed5dc11798ce15a71d27f617fbf606424641f29d; f9d055de932c442bea2cd71c41d308e3c12fafd4; 0a8179d2150973f50e01e9bf50b46a452f10b97c; 7103f3e0bf2891ded53c72e2ae1ca1ba78465776,,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry,56,136-141

Healthcare interventions are usually associated with a risk of harmful events that must be balanced against the potential favorable outcomes. However reliable evidence on harms for interventions is often inadequate, and hampered by the many challenges that stem from the reporting, analysis and interpretation of harms data in clinical trials. This thesis addresses some of these issues. 
Methods 
Reporting of harms data is assessed in a systematic review of reviews and a case study investigating the additional value of harms data reported in clinical study reports (CSRs). A framework for searching and identifying relevant sources of harms data is outlined, and then explored further in a survey assessing current practices in clinical trial units (CTUs). Signal detection methods are introduced, and evaluated using simulated data to assess their performance when detecting safety signals in CTU databases. 
Results 
The systematic review highlights that the reporting of harms in RCTs is inconsistent, and often inadequate. In the case study, CSRs presented data on harms, including SAEs which are not reported or mentioned in publications, they also provide more detail about the design, conduct and analysis of the trial which facilitate the assessment of risk of bias in evidence synthesis. A wide range of sources for harms data have been identified, each with distinct strengths and limitations discussed. Selection of appropriate sources depends on the research question, and whether a hypothesis generating or hypothesis testing approach should be taken. Relevant sources have been identified for each approach, with examples of their exploitation in CTUs evaluated in the survey. The simulation study has shown that some of the current available signal detection methods are not able to control the false discovery rate well, and are only able to detect few safety signals for small or sparse data. 
Conclusions 
The work carried out within this thesis provides some recommendations to address the reporting, conduct, and analysis of harms in clinical trials. Wider adoption of recommendations made by the CONSORT-harms guideline will enhance the quality of reporting and improve subsequent evidence synthesis. Recent initiatives to promote open access to clinical trials data including CSRs is a major step towards supporting better data transparency. It is important to identify and consider different sources that are most likely to yield robust data on harms of interest, rather than relying on studies that cannot reliably detect harm. The survey identified published literature and systematic reviews as the most common source being used in the trial safety monitoring within CTUs. Signal detection methods are potentially unsuitable for use in CTUs. Further tools and guidelines for enhanced signal detection are needed in clinical trials.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexander Hodkinson"", ids = ""51255884"")",1207016fbf95ce8d9628bf1a8bd91d9babbe5b5e,,,,

Dissecting the mechanism by which natural variation in XETs affects wood properties can inform breeding efforts to improve wood quality and yield traits. To this end, we isolated a full-length PtoXET16A cDNA clone from Populus tomentosa. Real-time PCR analysis showed that PtoXET16A was maximally expressed in the root, followed by phloem, cambium, and developing xylem, suggesting that PtoXET16A plays important roles in the development of vascular tissues. Nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed that PtoXET16A has high single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity (Ï€ = 0.01266 and Î¸(w) = 0.01392) and low linkage disequilibrium (rÂ² â‰¥ 0.1, within 900 bp). SNP- and haplotype-based association analyses of 426 individuals from a natural population indicated that nine SNPs (including two non-synonymous markers and one splicing variant) (p â‰¤ 0.05, false discovery rate Q â‰¤ 0.01), and nine haplotypes (p â‰¤ 0.05) were significantly associated with growth and wood properties, each explaining from 3.40%-10.95% of phenotypic variance. This work shows that examination of allelic variation and linkage disequilibrium by a candidate-gene-based approach can help to decipher the genetic basis of wood formation.

(1) use nonparametric methods to demonstrate that random field theory (RFT)-based familywise error (FWE) correction for cluster inference does not control errors appropriately, and this discrepancy is more pronounced for lenient cluster-defining thresholds (CDT). Moreover, they point to violations of RFT assumptions as the culprit for this discrepancy.

Given these results, how should we interpret existing fMRI literature that used RFT-based, FWE-corrected P values ( p RFT - FWE )? To suggest caution is reasonable but incomplete; we require concrete, quantitative guidelines to enable appropriate calibration of skepticism.

Here, we undertake an initial attempt at such guidance. We heed Eklund et al.â€™s (1) warning and prefer nonparametric null distributions to RFT. However, we focus on the false discovery rate (FDR) (2 â€¦

3a33d097824bf49e6d21dcbc9c99fe310e806501,Gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ulcerative colitis patients.,"AIM
To identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression profiles of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, using oligonucleotide microarrays, to gain insights into UC molecular mechanisms.


METHODS
The Human OneArray microarrays were used for a complete genome-wide transcript profiling of PBMCs from 12 UC patients and 6 controls. Differential analysis per gene was performed with a random variance model; t test and P values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate (5%). Gene ontology (GO) was deployed to analyze differentially expressed genes at significant levels between patients and controls to identify the biological processes involved in UC.


RESULTS
Comparative analysis revealed that 4438 probes (4188 genes) were differentially expressed between the two groups, of which 3689 probes (3590 genes) were down-regulated whereas 749 probes (598 genes) were up-regulated. Many disregulated genes in our data have been reported by previous microarray studies carried out on intestinal mucosa samples, such as S100A8, CEACAM1 and S100A9. GO enrichment analysis revealed 67 high enrichment up-regulated categories and one significant down-regulated category. The up-regulated genes were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory response, cell cycle and proliferation, DNA metabolism and repair.


CONCLUSION
Gene expression profiling of PBMCs from patients with UC has highlighted several novel gene categories that could contribute to the pathogenesis of UC.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ying-Lei Miao"", ids = ""83626222""); list(name = ""Yu-liang Xiao"", ids = ""7986499""); list(name = ""Yan Du"", ids = ""145767160""); list(name = ""Li-ping Duan"", ids = ""46349740"")",5ae3895eb3781099779663081b6dd9d45aa3643c; 0f53a53b894e4c94ea5334421c3f673fc56e0c23; 1d18fc8dcfec374b17acbdac2090d8d55534a570; eb172b03bfa2c87e09df72515a019988b3fd7399,,World journal of gastroenterology,19 21,"

Some methods require specifying a number of parcels and using model selection to determine the number of parcels on a rs-fMRI dataset. However, this generalization does not fit with all subjects in a given dataset. A method has been proposed using parametric formulas for the distribution of modularity in random networks to determine the statistical significance between parcels. In this paper, we propose an agglomerative clustering algorithm using parametric formulas for the distribution of modularity in random networks, coupled with a false discovery rate (FDR) controller to parcellate rs-fMRI data. The proposed method combines FDR to reduce the number of false positives and incorporates spatial information to ensure the regions are spatially contiguous. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed FDR controlled method yields more accurate results when compared with existing methods.

393715882c7383da30cdfffee7b3a0ca901caecc,Abstract 3894: The importance of matched tumor and normal DNA for somatic mutation discovery and clinical interpretation,"Proceedings: AACR 106th Annual Meeting 2015; April 18-22, 2015; Philadelphia, PA

Massively parallel sequencing approaches are beginning to be used clinically to characterize individual patient tumors and to identify targeted therapies based on mutations identified. A major question in these analyses is the extent to which these methods identify clinically actionable alterations in patients and whether the examination of the tumor tissue alone is sufficient or whether matched normal DNA should also be analyzed to accurately identify tumor-specific (somatic) alterations. To address these issues, we comprehensively evaluated tumor-normal paired samples from 753 cancers from fourteen tumor types. We analyzed somatic alterations using whole exome or targeted next generation sequencing approaches that were validated with high sensitivity and specificity. These analyses revealed an average of 140 and 4.34 somatic changes per exome and targeted analyses, respectively. Approximately 65% of cases had somatic alterations in genes associated with known therapies or current clinical trials. In contrast, a tumor-only sequencing approach followed by bioinformatic removal of common germline variants from existing databases led to a 36% and 58% false discovery rate in alterations identified in targeted and exome analyses, respectively, including in potentially actionable genes. These data suggest that matched tumor-normal sequencing analyses are essential for precise identification and interpretation of somatic alterations and have important implications for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of cancer patients.

1a5fc564f8b6aa58657ddb6a11bd3ab2a270c7ce,FACT: Fast closed testing for exchangeable local tests,"Multiple hypothesis testing problems arise naturally in science. In this paper, we introduce the new Fast Closed Testing (FACT) method for multiple testing, controlling the family-wise error rate. This error rate is state of the art in many important application areas, and is preferred to false discovery rate control for many reasons, including that it leads to stronger reproducibility. The closure principle rejects an individual hypothesis if all global nulls of subsets containing it are rejected using some test statistics. It takes exponential time in the worst case. When the tests are symmetric and monotone, our method is an exact algorithm for computing the closure, quadratic in the number of tests, and linear in the number of discoveries. Our framework generalizes most examples of closed testing such as Holm's and the Bonferroni method. As a special case of our method, we propose the Simes-higher criticism fusion test, which is powerful for detecting both a few strong signals, and also many moderate signals.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Edgar Dobriban"", ids = ""2694895"")",,,arXiv: Methodology,,

Aldosterone regulated 60 transcripts (51 upregulated and 9 downregulated) in the heart (fold change â‰¥1.5, false discovery rate <0.01). To identify the biological processes modulated by aldosterone, a gene ontology analysis was performed. The majority of aldosteroneregulated genes were involved in cell division. The cardiac Ki-67 index (an index of proliferation) of aldosterone-treated mice was higher than that of nontreated mice, confirming microarray predictions. Costaining of Ki-67 with vinculin, CD68, a-smooth muscle actin, CD31, or caveolin 1 revealed that the cycling cells were essentially endothelial cells. Aldosterone-induced mineralocorticoid receptorâ€“dependent proliferation was confirmed ex vivo in human endothelial cells. Moreover, pharmacological-specific blockade of mineralocorticoid receptor by eplerenone inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in a preclinical model of heart failure (transverse aortic constriction).",2015,,"list(name = ""Basile Gravez"", ids = ""4246429""); list(name = ""Antoine Tarjus"", ids = ""6539751""); list(name = ""eronique Pelloux"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Antoine Ouvrard-Pascaud"", ids = ""1395780013""); list(name = ""Claude Delcayre"", ids = ""6309070""); list(name = ""Janelise Samuel"", ids = ""39056165""); list(name = ""Karine Cl"", ids = list()); list(name = ""ement"", ids = ""133936424""); list(name = ""Nicolette Farman"", ids = ""4846068""); list(name = ""ederic Jaisser"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Smail Messaoudi"", ids = ""47146253"")",,7b4e40382870723c4f4adc25aeba5f240d00bb4b; 9cfe677e9e492d780d2056c7600356d2eeb756ce; bac638d3d7859fe294cb8c51d791a68f7273e6df; f1b48b0bfed03aff2b714cd01294b60cd5cd225e; 9ff381ccb5ac88599b3a931e48585250996fbae8; 16f36a83a18849ab6412c7432e65e8576a94fb6a; ee6eb7b60be6146392fb8169e2297b99dc1657b5; e5b209b18422d2529f8ecc7302cbcd52bc5b58b5; a53cb3ebd8d0d2d3858ac9f8432a0b4eb22379a4; 51c2888c6346d56ff49ba9af4b903ee08af0f730; 599bc9231e67a6af7527953a908bfbcf46864b34; e3bf0a14deaae832a66da2de96feff633360ea14; 026031a19f269b2d32bf02d85f2a16e75a7373c0; 799bf4e5aa68d5b3959f406858a6c5e3b512e8b6; 962e851714210f1606388f9c23d03d7864ef1be2; 54da10c8a0eee15a008bd3239d14e51a9c01f355; bffc48ecb411dfe846e96d4880dbd3ae65e58b52; 723bdfcc84f2e8cd5efb6cd272805f9a88f5d9be; 78058c51ef390c715b72cf5bf8339ce4c8d5646b; 1234837eed07e4f4a90a54f72e9b9ba590de0638; 000e2fe3045df1ad788a6cb9b59285f40c60950b; 4782a2d49fd2cf26d026af1a2f85fd8c24ad4866; 66089b9e4cb11a3af32de84c1bc9538bc8141b30; 11ddc6f18db8cce715e7415f2825bbb1c9a5806b; 4bf70d06b1ab03090265ac4c3aeab230ad668ea4; 75471115e3441bfc16117532a1d2cd82fb417954; 55f9efbb02a10349c06184f201b32062eb965c6b; be92a2b414221805a226835c877962caded8fe28; 06d9e748db3fcf987b3eba1739821da220e42cc3; 33a6cd7876686aeb9a10995f2b8f4bf56ef55e97; acec0996a57b8f1966097640a10022e9b641c0e0; 87ee68220311a522b2c3538e308a650e50dfcefe; eb8296655d939750124690511b6d3d43180ec38d; 218381c5785f41dc29181006c9f7b90240d406b1; 7485da9cbd2816f046ce539ea0e38a495cb8a1a1; e06e798990d3c6539308a097f881f26e60c76905; 77c0f84256df4bf51001f1835042b98b3cfee006; 65b8ee72fe4ed6d87e938f4f838c853ca030fdd7; 9a86e3e321d127f6860d9503a9a1ea32b4190fe5,,,
d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b,Empirical bayes methods and false discovery rates for microarrays.,"In a classic two-sample problem, one might use Wilcoxon's statistic to test for a difference between treatment and control subjects. The analogous microarray experiment yields thousands of Wilcoxon statistics, one for each gene on the array, and confronts the statistician with a difficult simultaneous inference situation. We will discuss two inferential approaches to this problem: an empirical Bayes method that requires very little a priori Bayesian modeling, and the frequentist method of ""false discovery rates"" proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg in 1995. It turns out that the two methods are closely related and can be used together to produce sensible simultaneous inferences.",2002,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Bradley Efron"", ids = ""2550392"");

f61ddea561659e773ac88569719f84f0facf3009,Comments on the analysis of unbalanced microarray data,"MOTIVATION
Permutation testing is very popular for analyzing microarray data to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes; estimating false discovery rates (FDRs) is a very popular way to address the inherent multiple testing problem. However, combining these approaches may be problematic when sample sizes are unequal.


RESULTS
With unbalanced data, permutation tests may not be suitable because they do not test the hypothesis of interest. In addition, permutation tests can be biased. Using biased P-values to estimate the FDR can produce unacceptable bias in those estimates. Results also show that the approach of pooling permutation null distributions across genes can produce invalid P-values, since even non-DE genes can have different permutation null distributions. We encourage researchers to use statistics that have been shown to reliably discriminate DE genes, but caution that associated P-values may be either invalid, or a less-effective metric for discriminating DE genes.",2009,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kathleen F.

f57b4fb5c6c5e31478f7936d4abcc8071682694d,DNA Methylation is Altered in Maternal Blood Vessels of Women With Preeclampsia,"We analyzed 27 578 CpG sites that map to 14 495 genes in omental arteries of normal pregnant and preeclamptic women for DNA methylation status using the Illumina platform. We found 1685 genes with a significant difference in DNA methylation at a false discovery rate of <10% with many inflammatory genes having reduced methylation. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed natural clustering by diagnosis and methylation status. Of the genes with significant methylation differences, 236 were significant at a false discovery rate of <5%. When data were analyzed more stringently to a false discovery rate of <5% and difference in methylation of >0.10, 65 genes were identified, all of which showed reduced methylation in preeclampsia. When these genes were mapped to gene ontology for molecular functions and biological processes, 75 molecular functions and 149 biological processes were overrepresented in the preeclamptic vessels. These included smooth muscle contraction, thrombosis, inflammation, redox homeostasis, sugar metabolism, and amino acid metabolism.

c2fd43a95e17f6bf16574b37476b279e50f5c453,RECAP reveals the true statistical significance of ChIP-seq peak calls,"MOTIVATION
ChIP-seq is used extensively to identify sites of transcription factor binding or regions of epigenetic modifications to the genome. A key step in ChIP-seq analysis is peak calling, where genomic regions enriched for ChIP versus control reads are identified. Many programs have been designed to solve this task, but nearly all fall into the statistical trap of using the data twice-once to determine candidate enriched regions, and again to assess enrichment by classical statistical hypothesis testing. This double use of the data invalidates the statistical significance assigned to enriched regions, thus the true significance or reliability of peak calls remains unknown.


RESULTS
Using simulated and real ChIP-seq data, we show that three well-known peak callers, MACS, SICER and diffReps, output biased p-values and false discovery rate estimates that can be many orders of magnitude too optimistic. We propose a wrapper algorithm, RECAP, that uses resampling of ChIP-seq and control data to estimate a monotone transform correcting for biases built into peak calling algorithms. When applied to null hypothesis data, where there is no enrichment between ChIP-seq and control, p-values recalibrated by RECAP are approximately uniformly distributed. On data where there is genuine enrichment, RECAP p-values give a better estimate of the true statistical significance of candidate peaks and better false discovery rate estimates, which correlate better with empirical reproducibility. RECAP is a powerful new tool for assessing the true statistical significance of ChIP-seq peak calls.

Patients are usually diagnosed when current treatments have limited benefits, highlighting the need for noninvasive early diagnostic tests to monitor asbestosâ€exposed people. Methods: We used a genomeâ€wide methylation array to identify, in asbestosâ€exposed subjects, novel blood DNA methylation markers of MPM in 163 MPM cases and 137 cancerâ€free controls (82 MPM cases and 68 controls, training set; replication in 81 MPM cases and 69 controls, test set) sampled from the same areas. Results: Evidence of differential methylation between MPM cases and controls was found (more than 800 cytosineâ€guanine dinucleotide sites, false discovery rate p value (pfdr) < 0.05), mainly in immune systemâ€“related genes. Considering the top differentially methylated signals, seven singleâ€ cytosineâ€guanine dinucleotides and five genomic regions of coordinated methylation replicated with similar effect size in the test set (pfdr < 0.05). The top hypomethylated singleâ€CpG (cases versus controls effect size less than â€0.15, pfdr < 0.05 in both the training and test sets) was detected in FOXK1 (Forkheadâ€box K1) gene, an interactor of BAP1 which was found mutated in MPM tissue and as germline mutation in familial MPM. In the test set, comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC) of two models, including or excluding methylation, showed a significant increase in case/control discrimination when considering DNA methylation together with asbestos exposure (AUC = 0.81 versus AUC = 0.89, DeLongâ€™s test p = 0.0013). Conclusions: We identified signatures of differential methylation in DNA from whole blood between asbestos exposed MPM cases and controls.

We show step-by-step how effect size measures can be calculated for each data aspect and subsequently integrated as test statistics in multiple randomization tests. To control for Type I errors, we discuss three methods for adjusting the obtained p-values based on the false discovery rate: the multiple testing correction proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), the adaptive correction suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000), and the correction taking into account the dependency between the tests (Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001). We apply this approach to a published data set and compare the results to the conclusions drawn by the authors based on visual analysis.

c980ac14a30fbf4a16717bf85f1e228e267cb2d5,Gray Matter Concentration Abnormality in Brains of Narcolepsy Patients,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate gray matter concentration changes in the brains of narcoleptic patients.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-nine narcoleptic patient with cataplexy and 29 age and sex-matched normal subjects (mean age, 31 years old) underwent volumetric MRIs. The MRIs were spatially normalized to a standard T1 template and subdivided into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These segmented images were then smoothed using a 12-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel. An optimized voxel-based morphometry protocol was used to analyze brain tissue concentrations using SPM2 (statistical parametric mapping). A one-way analysis of variance was applied to the concentration analysis of gray matter images.


RESULTS
Narcoleptics with cataplexy showed reduced gray matter concentration in bilateral thalami, left gyrus rectus, bilateral frontopolar gyri, bilateral short insular gyri, bilateral superior frontal gyri, and right superior temporal and left inferior temporal gyri compared to normal subjects (uncorrected p < 0.001). Furthermore, small volume correction revealed gray matter concentration reduction in bilateral nuclei accumbens, hypothalami, and thalami (false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
Gray matter concentration reductions were observed in brain regions related to excessive daytime sleepiness, cognition, attention, and memory in narcoleptics with cataplexy.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eun Yeon Joo"", ids = ""1920146""); list(name = ""Woo Suk Tae"", ids = ""5316406""); list(name = ""Sung Tae Kim"", ids = ""1775134""); list(name = ""Seung Bong Hong"", ids = ""3018797"")",4fb1dbbe12ce7e62ca0628d42ed95c6a44b5e8e9; a6e252a9421d8999f9c74786605141efecab2126; 731ceeccd55df0ff155c95d119a429ee0726b605; 2bec01812af7094e261b226cf77be3b709dea704; a3a11e0d66362f2a37ab8eb30c4c0727fe5a740e; 7b69b1d6dfaca3455dae4c33babe63cff4c6bba7; ea1e0335f014f4a46de97fe18223852c3a40e0d8; 78503a3ecfa3fbaf2cf36b282f186738a1c66588; 21456828362d285dda1c7e9c920ca55faa73c1bb; 258dbb3fed2b510a5632e8b6ea049f87b1fe0ad9; c8c98e58702706dff570d7a9d75ea7b5eb765642; eb5720fddacb0a9a56ed47ab43be9c5d6144b681; 13e15dbeb389c9b9c5c46550f67f13a97a3eb5d0; ff79fb66773b7de25ec930b84461628c210103ae; 5dd7cd0f61b98d0b76eab22e01dca531c88477ec; eb7285354d6ecf15232255b7babe16d041ae3047; d66c5c463c600e2bbd6051bc3df852de20c192b5; a38da50cb457945a947372cc2709bdb8c7a244fc; f3c5394a0bfed76ddbb67cb27b6e82fe94a2fdcb; c638ad88fb5fee720f69b50bdba509aa2f5db221; 726bd79459a7b398b9db1c4832d0fe627e38d309; b1f2446c23bfdc9e87f5a649ebe7d22fc8f99fca; af9d6b4f825b0029d41e4c13d0f942133bbed791,99a9430e8844a602c0e0481c158bb14a067856b4; f2c29af94ac576d389203f79fe83cfdab467626c; 9dc5f72c6937c2676f04dd95fd822e9b5dad6599; c9d39d38ec8930a72c43461e060c125390072b35; 3b480e681c9b66f66fba38c1702b2c669d35ea49; dd4ace828583ad7c13882f5aff8469ab700b7a0a; 829841837b266b33bd4ea804eafcfa72b1f60729; 8adf4deb27f58f456693360f2642bd83b7b22c5a; 48abfc1c749b43c113d46feefce14ae5b0777d48; 236cb915a1724c4b9ec3e53cfed64ce169358cda; 84eb07936c4afb5f0e5603fd65445a1586fe1221; 5019810791f26755ca2fdc1c364e5e1bfd3f994e; b0de78343cc7af09b9a47a0d1fe19afe34c84ab7; 4426aae6ca63bbccf7264da188ece8e9c19db4b4; 2b5a82c6a1986178eec8671d24bbc3ec9dc0030c; 0c5cf37d8bb54aa09c685ad132751b487b07e20b; 55b7637a30cb22fa5256c7363435a97262e43eea; 510300fb475446db8ac266f1697db726c6b2d92f; 65bb1e3b1cad4cdc91e3730ed9b68aea42ba5276; ded2bb1b1d1f08a81b2161e7c64d82e18a0d956c; f4b8029a88cae77dec4a30ad62ec360dd994686a; f65610116165ff751d49ef80f39f144ea49f751d; 2908dd5342f9ef7861ff50a2ed2fa14743e428e3; e4e4d3fb2bdc62e3a09060253d37f8bcbf346689; e5f124c0864271967274084c07ae49b00f228f1f; 4a9974446ecc9b795e7b6387d228f9490b43a891,Korean Journal of Radiology,10,552 - 558
1b3df1ecb3590b03118eb2d768d45e19ad84f5b3,Thyroid-associated orbitopathy and tears: A proteomics study.,"To date, Thyroid-Associated Orbitopathy (TAO), an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the eye, remains poorly characterised and its diagnosis challenging. The aim of this study was to investigate the tears of the TAO patients in order to identify potential biomarkers. Two independent quantitative Tandem Mass Tagâ„¢ 6-plex experiments were done. After in-solution digestion and isoelectric fractionation, the 12 fractions were analysed with a LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled to a liquid chromatography. Raw files were searched against Swiss-Prot-AC database using Proteome Discoverer software, with a false discovery rate of 1% at peptide and protein levels. The differential proteins were then verified using orthogonal approaches in independent patients. Globally, 712 tear proteins were quantified with 2 unique peptides. Interestingly, cystatin c (TAO/controls ratio: 1.53), alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ratio: 1.70) and retinal dehydrogenase (ratio: 0.68), displaying differential levels in the tears of TAO patients using proteomics experiments emerged as highly promising biomarkers after verification. In conclusion, this proteomics study supports the idea that tears reflect biological modifications occurring in a disease context and can therefore be a promising fluid for biomarker discovery. Moreover, our study identified three candidates that could in the future open new avenues in the diagnosis of TAO disease.


SIGNIFICANCE
Thyroid associated orbitopathy (TAO) is the most common disease affecting the orbit. Moreover, the later, severe stages of the disease can be sight threating [1]. On the other hand, the early sign and symptoms can be mistaken with other ocular pathologies [2]. Here we explore the modification of the tear content of the TAO patients using proteomics strategies and we proposed three new biomarker candidates, which could allow the early diagnosis of the disease and prompt action to prevent more severe stages. Moreover, our findings could also help to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Edina Kishazi"", ids = ""24540763""); list(name = ""Marianne Dor"", ids = ""40316387""); list(name = ""Simone Eperon"", ids = ""6400331""); list(name = ""AurÃ©lie ObÃ©ric"", ids = ""7722097""); list(name = ""Mehrad HamÃ©dani"", ids = ""3644199""); list(name = ""Natacha Turck"", ids = ""3090479"")",03ff1545d99b54d882579e77ec409620493ea303; 97a2336f53ae53ccf8bdb0610042d1faadb0f53d; 6cdcc37f8c37e99c6be51ebd57de31d12f90f0de,,Journal of proteomics,170,"

14d44a92d33fbc1ccf8870f103501c53852adafb,Strong approximations of level exceedences related to multiple hypothesis testing,"Particularly in genomics, but also in other fields, it has become commonplace to undertake highly multiple Studentâ€™s t-tests based on relatively small sample sizes. The literature on this topic is continually expanding, but the main approaches used to control the family-wise error rate and false discovery rate are still based on the assumption that the tests are independent. The independence condition is known to be false at the level of the joint distributions of the test statistics, but that does not necessarily mean, for the small significance levels involved in highly multiple hypothesis testing, that the assumption leads to major errors. In this paper, we give conditions under which the assumption of independence is valid. Specifically, we derive a strong approximation that closely links the level exceedences of a dependent â€œstudentized processâ€ to those of a process of independent random variables. Via this connection, it can be seen that in high-dimensional, low sample-size cases, provided the sample size diverges faster than the logarithm of the number of tests, the assumption of independent t-tests is often justified.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peter A.

ff9a127b7a65619b05848aff363adcdc1012db94,Microsatellite markers associated with resistance to Marek's disease in commercial layer chickens.,"The objective of the current study was to identify QTL conferring resistance to Marek's disease (MD) in commercial layer chickens. To generate the resource population, 2 partially inbred lines that differed in MD-caused mortality were intermated to produce 5 backcross families. Vaccinated chicks were challenged with very virulent plus (vv+) MD virus strain 648A at 6 d and monitored for MD symptoms. A recent field isolate of the MD virus was used because the lines were resistant to commonly used older laboratory strains. Selective genotyping was employed using 81 microsatellites selected based on prior results with selective DNA pooling. Linear regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to detect associations between marker genotypes and survival. Significance thresholds were validated by simulation. Seven and 6 markers were significant based on proportion of false positive and false discovery rate thresholds less than 0.2, respectively. Seventeen markers were associated with MD survival considering a comparison-wise error rate of 0.10, which is about twice the number expected by chance, indicating that at least some of the associations represent true effects. Thus, the present study shows that loci affecting MD resistance can be mapped in commercial layer lines.

7d4ef6814c697202cab717444923344176846b59,A genome-wide association study of meat colour in commercial crossbred pigs,"Phenotypes of meat colour (Minolta L*, a*, and b*) measured from six different positions and genotypes (Illumina PorcineSNP60 version 2 Genotyping Beadchip) were obtained from 1977 crossbred commercial pigs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to detect genomic regions associated with multiple meat colour traits using the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and single-marker association analysis was conducted to confirm the significance of the associations. A total of 20 genomic regions were detected and confirmed, with significant (false discovery rate <0.1) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in all the candidate regions. Compared with a previous analysis conducted using the same population, the current analysis detected overlapping but distinct candidate regions and extended the number of candidate regions for meat colour in this data set. Seventeen of the 20 regions overlapped with known pork quality quantitative trait loci.

0bc0bf7cda1616990bdac7a657a01a6a024f55a9,Undesirable optimality results in multiple testing,"A number of authors have considered the problem of making multiple comparisons among level-one parameters in multilevel models. This is a setting in which Bayesian procedures have a natural sampling theory interpretation, and where a natural justification for methods that control a directional version of the false discovery rate may be found. However, a basic desirable characteristic of multiple comparison procedures, namely that they should be more conservative than corresponding â€˜per-comparisonâ€™ procedures, appears to be violated by some optimal procedures that have been developed in a multilevel setting. This concern is illustrated in the context of a very simple multilevel model, namely one-way, random-effects analysis of variance.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Charles Lewis"", ids = ""47004998""); list(name = ""Dorothy T.

6a919286963e9622cda69b5864266e321eece547,Clinical and Metabolic Characterization of Lean Caucasian Subjects With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver,"Objectives:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely linked to obesity; however, 5â€“8% of lean subjects also have evidence of NAFLD. We aimed to investigate clinical, genetic, metabolic and lifestyle characteristics in lean Caucasian subjects with NAFLD.Methods:Data from 187 subjects allocated to one of the three groups according to body mass index (BMI) and hepatic steatosis on ultrasound were obtained: lean healthy (BMIâ‰¤25â€‰kg/m2, no steatosis, N=71), lean NAFLD (BMIâ‰¤25â€‰kg/m2, steatosis, N=55), obese NAFLD (BMIâ‰¥30â€‰kg/m2, steatosis; N=61). All subjects received a detailed clinical and laboratory examination including oral glucose tolerance test. The serum metabolome was assessed using the Metabolomics AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit (BIOCRATES Life Sciences). Genotyping for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with NAFLD was performed.Results:Lean NAFLD subjects had fasting insulin concentrations similar to lean healthy subjects but had markedly impaired glucose tolerance.

0ce5723adc8d5cab6763b316d3cc15e575c2c77d,Comprehensive behavioral analysis of heterozygous Syngap1 knockout mice.,"AIMS
Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1) regulates synaptic plasticity through AMPA receptor trafficking. SYNGAP1 mutations have been found in human patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Almost every individual withÂ SYNGAP1-related ID develops epilepsy, and approximately 50% have ASD. SYNGAP1-related ID is estimated to account for at least 1% of ID cases. In mouse models with Syngap1 mutations, strong cognitive and affective dysfunctions have been reported, yet some findings are inconsistent across studies. To further understand the behavioral significance of the SYNGAP1 gene, we assessed various domains of behavior in Syngap1 heterozygous mutant mice using a behavioral test battery.


METHODS
Male mice with a heterozygous mutation in the Syngap1 gene (Syngap1-/+ mice) created by Seth Grant's group were subjected to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, which examined general health, and neurological screens, rotarod, hot plate, open field, light/dark transition, elevated plus maze, social interaction, prepulse inhibition, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, gait analysis, T-maze, Y-maze, Barnes maze, contextual and cued fear conditioning, and home cage locomotor activity. To control for type I errors due to multiple-hypothesis testing, P-values below the false discovery rate calculated by the Benjamini-Hochberg method were considered as study-wide statistically significant.


RESULTS
Syngap1-/+ mice showed increased locomotor activity, decreased prepulse inhibition, and impaired working and reference spatial memory, consistent with preceding studies. Impairment of context fear memory and increased startle reflex in Syngap1 mutant mice could not be reproduced. Significant decreases in sensitivity to painful stimuli and impaired motor function were observed in Syngap1-/+ mice. Decreased anxiety-like behavior and depression-like behavior were noted, although increased locomotor activity is a potential confounding factor of these phenotypes. Increased home cage locomotor activity indicated hyperlocomotor activity not only in specific behavioral test conditions but also in familiar environments.


CONCLUSION
In Syngap1-/+ mice, we could reproduce most of the previously reported cognitive and emotional deficits. The decreased sensitivity to painful stimuli and impaired motor function that we found in Syngap1-/+ mice are consistent with the common characteristics of patients with SYNGAP-related ID. We further confirmed that the Syngap1 heterozygote mouse recapitulates the symptoms of ID and ASD patients.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ryuichi Nakajima"", ids = ""7264642""); list(name = ""Keizo Takao"", ids = ""36670136""); list(name = ""Satoko Hattori"", ids = ""31924014""); list(name = ""Hirotaka Shoji"", ids = ""6325411""); list(name = ""Noboru Komiyama"", ids = ""35655550""); list(name = ""Seth G N Grant"", ids = ""144426502""); list(name = ""Tsuyoshi Miyakawa"", ids = ""144526510"")",34542492c463fa1e0a0bf684a61f106a2f8c2a38; 7620013b78722e1a4fa83cd306e03ae49d9036d7,0ed391cf6282b68a0b83665b2b69209e678baafe; 33004d0e676107fdd5e99116071483b8416e2b91; 868891a1cfc60626f0a026885286814012852101; 361437f8b1cafe6316d7486cf0f39d1452e66bde; 69cab219aeaf5cab451fa8ccad1fadf4b0bc82b9; cdd67f64469d841b4dd3aa50a54ceb8e353fa570; 80e6906caee639307f8f66c61d9be8840fee89ff; daf7204894244bf2e57c1c72cb86da46ec1d8e61; 5caf668bb4b6dbea717e633cdf8eed11d733dd7d; f26b84a9118df5fa7693d432f5cbedd325f11929; 26ad02311c4ab428ffec8b7cf75d57df09442859; 3175d3037614cf68e8d7fb6224a80d716354ed90; 57bfcd0f2887eed603611d7a984d79b75cea52fa; fe286d6cead8052a0e8df5aecbf6fd966d8c8639; c0d8ce182bf4fee80047640f12cbaf2ec447f8a0; eda2d0b525e9952dce1400894913244f45125895; 3dfd8d1a5463fb9bcf53a970f97df3cf5520606d; 801efb3b6c3105b9f3554d5dd7fb47c4dc70c9eb; fc87c1dce25905e61c52f4815dec4d5b6d158d2c; 1d22f47a585ac8341c1170141478de9310a58182; 31bcc7de51ff08bd2d85cd6245497155bb1a92c6; 7ed853cb28c087e815bb417769191130758ee3ef; 7dca2b0345e668bc48253a9826a5aed928ba1501; f507c527dc07ba0f24db43a4500ebae18153fd1d; 947e36f0514fd9210eb05d32504d1b8a0f5a5be5; b2679579b19a42f56ffee5efb0762ea608c3fad7; 125fce0198fda44c284393b4982ac2e9d4a6a9e9; 481a180c5a7107dc0b1f082d5e31437bbe651edb; 31d2ec5d55074bdefe3287a477d36f629b47d036; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 12ca55c1f5387100fb907fa6c06ea3dc3f7f74c5; c48a4a3f150a642ad34338a8858c068971000598; b083421095bab26c27907216db85ddd87aa1476d; 449d2fe289bf956be54161fc8edd1c3845dbe177; 20d21e237605f4c6a627d0ea5bc842f58b17ffa5; 5e6074efbe2e45a13feca9a6e1be300fc348c561; b44ed7311439bd99ea13fc332b66bfd3fc497cf0; 089936803bd6c2dae7febd46e040c91547099e74; 8caf2f713619fcdc50dc7a55cf9bcfba66465b04; 69e898e771e32ab64edace014787ca35cafde418; 4f8aee88bbe9c88d605fd564435ebd02cee8b823; 1c32f4614d635d5c32bac0028bf37d0649c8ac1b; 28595089e70bcaa63a5dea1765f06bced7a2b113; f1bb19c786bac02e6a2ed8127e0d6bb17a9c9909; ee7ea176056f65dab15580882c5eb74a1716a6db; 359b4ecf1ee0508fa52c8f49552dcd8b99870830; 8235d72ee911c75f21add9191e3e472993834326; 95fe8e34400a5566bbcb9ff9d2d727c354472a6c; f427ab4c845b3f9e2db28ab05f824aa8cac8cf0d; 06aec795c7ee1c119a915e98a036e6f51708ebd1; d84e5316bffaf0e26cf3ef9834d60bd552d6e597; 55e737c27ec0d9f89c6ad4ccee023d5acc363973; 41dcbe440d42ed5c9152e66a57b838551e43da73; a747c7ff82880287521d0ecaaf4d536656adfc4f; afa5a010e8e6d7c4ff5455732cf8f899338de828; 3598622a15ec8475a1c19176858cc147f30b6f22; 575727e8e8a27abfacfb24fb03cc172081ff8154; 39bf383bf1d155be3327a775b120e0dd6e220c91; 43df0741068ba8dd796bd795a3b87206611fd0d7; 60b16ef29db424d12c0910f8795eb7328a08002d; e256f2333a8e6fd65f73ea36a66bd2c65d8fd214; 28a202285e160f2a662b9a0853a2157a59767f6c,Neuropsychopharmacology reports,,
536fcc8c4d577aa0fb52ad63e90bb0ac5e65580a,A New Method of Peak Detection for Analysis of Comprehensive Two-dimensional Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Data.,"We develop a novel peak detection algorithm for the analysis of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCÃ—GC-TOF MS) data using normal-exponential-Bernoulli (NEB) and mixture probability models. The algorithm first performs baseline correction and denoising simultaneously using the NEB model, which also defines peak regions. Peaks are then picked using a mixture of probability distribution to deal with the co-eluting peaks. Peak merging is further carried out based on the mass spectral similarities among the peaks within the same peak group. The algorithm is evaluated using experimental data to study the effect of different cut-offs of the conditional Bayes factors and the effect of different mixture models including Poisson, truncated Gaussian, Gaussian, Gamma, and exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) distributions, and the optimal version is introduced using a trial-and-error approach. We then compare the new algorithm with two existing algorithms in terms of compound identification.

d4fb7aa3e53f6d2028e46eaa054d2c434c7fd805,Phosphoproteome Analysis of Human Liver Tissue by Long-gradient Nanoflow LC Coupled with Multiple Stage Mass Spectrometric Analysis,"Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in liver development and function. Comprehensively cataloging the phosphoproteins and their phosphorylation sites in human liver tissue will facilitate the understanding of physiological and pathological mechanisms of liver. As lacking of efficient approach to fractionate phosphopeptides, nanoflow-RPLC with long gradient elution was applied to reduce the complexity of the phosphopeptides in this study. Two approaches were performed to further improve the coverage of phosphoproteome analysis of human liver tissue. In the first approach, 10 replicated long-gradient LC-MS/MS runs were performed to analyze the enriched phosphopeptides which resulted in the localization of 1,080 phosphorylation sites from 495 proteins. In the second approach, proteins from liver tissue were first fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then long-gradient LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the phosphopeptides derived from each fraction which resulted in localization of 1,786 phosphorylation sites from 911 proteins. The two approaches showed the complementarity in phosphoproteome analysis of human liver tissue. Combining the results, the identification of 2,225 nonredundant phosphorylation sites from 1,023 proteins was obtained. The confidence of phosphopeptide identifications was strictly controlled with false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤1% by a MS2/MS3 target-decoy database search approach. Among the localized 2,225 phosphorylated sites, as many as 70.07% (1,559 phosphorylated sites) were also reported by others which confirmed the high confidence of the sites determined in this study. Considering the data acquired from low accuracy mass spectrometer and processed by a conservative MS2/MS3 target-decoy approach, the high confidence phosphoproteome data set obtained for human liver tissue in this study is quite impressive.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""éŸ©å¹¿è¾‰"", ids = ""90626304""); list(name = ""å\217¶æ\230Žäº®"", ids = ""90936086""); list(name = ""çŽ‹ä¸½å\220\215"", ids = ""90179685""); list(name = ""é‚¹æ±‰æ³•"", ids = ""90745449"")",,,,,
a8a4a6d9cd5dc89d75e3e0c8b682e4778459b1d4,Genetic variants in the renin-angiotensin system and blood pressure reactions to the cold pressor test.,"OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study was to examine the association between genetic variants in the renin-angiotensin system and blood pressure (BP) responses to the cold pressor test (CPT).


METHODS
The CPT was conducted among 1998 Han Chinese participants. BP measurements were obtained before and after the CPT using a standard sphygmomanometer according to a standard protocol. The association between SNP genotypes and BP responses to the CPT was assessed using a mixed linear model.


RESULTS
Of 68 SNPs genotyped in six renin-angiotensin system genes, two were strongly associated with DBP responses to CPT (P â‰¤ 0.001; false discovery rate q value < 0.05): rs2006765 and rs943580 in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene. Compared to C allele carriers of rs2006765, the TT homozygotes had a significantly decreased DBP response to the CPT. For participants with the TT genotype, percentage DBP responses were 5.68% (4.25-7.10%), compared to corresponding responses of 9.17% (8.66-9.68%) among participants with the CC+CT genotype. In addition, SNP rs4681443 of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AGTR1) gene was significantly associated with percentage SBP responses to CPT (P â‰¤ 0.001; q-value <0.05).


CONCLUSION
Briefly, our study identified variants in the AGT and AGTR1 genes that may influence BP responses to CPT in the Han Chinese population. These results show that genetic variants in the renin-angiotensin system play an important role in BP responses to CPT and, therefore, in predicting future hypertension.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Laiyuan Wang"", ids = ""34705778""); list(name = ""Liping Hou"", ids = ""48557329""); list(name = ""Hongfan Li"", ids = ""4873921""); list(name = ""Jing Chen"", ids = ""1719866""); list(name = ""Tanika N Kelly"", ids = ""3055948""); list(name = ""Cashell E.

To investigate its population genetic structure and patterns of regional connectivity, microsatellite loci were developed for M. isos from two genomic libraries using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform. Twenty-six loci amplified consistently in M. isos from the Tasman Sea, among which 20 were polymorphic and selectively neutral. Evidence of null alleles was observed at eight loci. Most loci exhibited moderate to high levels of polymorphism, with an average polymorphic information content value of 0.482. The mean number of alleles per locus was 7.45, with a mean expected heterozygosity of 0.520. Thirteen loci exhibited significant deviation from Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium, while only one locus pair was in linkage disequilibrium after false discovery rate correction for multiple testing ($$P < 0.05$$P<0.05). Cross-species amplification tests revealed that the transferability of 14 loci (70%) was positive for the two congeners M. endeavourae and M. gracilis.

78ce1e4dda61b21a0fed186007dba9c73875b717,NucBreak: location of structural errors in a genome assembly by using paired-end Illumina reads,"Advances in whole genome sequencing strategies have provided the opportunity for genomic and comparative genomic analysis of a vast variety of organisms. The analysis results are highly dependent on the quality of the genome assemblies used. Assessment of the assembly accuracy may significantly increase the reliability of the analysis results and is therefore of great importance. Here, we present a new tool called NucBreak aimed at localizing structural errors in assemblies, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and different inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements. The approach taken by existing alternative tools is based on analysing reads that do not map properly to the assembly, for instance discordantly mapped reads, soft-clipped reads and singletons. NucBreak uses an entirely different and unique method to localise the errors. It is based on analysing the alignments of reads that are properly mapped to an assembly and exploit information about the alternative read alignments. It does not annotate detected errors. We have compared NucBreak with other existing assembly accuracy assessment tools, namely Pilon, REAPR, and FRCbam as well as with several structural variant detection tools, including BreakDancer, Lumpy, and Wham, by using both simulated and real datasets. The benchmarking results have shown that NucBreak in general predicts assembly errors of different types and sizes with relatively high sensitivity and with lower false discovery rate than the other tools. Such a balance between sensitivity and false discovery rate makes NucBreak a good alternative to the existing assembly accuracy assessment tools and SV detection tools.

This paper studies weighted multiple testing in a decision-theoretic framework. We develop oracle and data-driven procedures that aim to maximize the expected number of true positives subject to a constraint on the weighted false discovery rate. The asymptotic validity and optimality of the proposed methods are established. The results demonstrate that incorporating informative domain knowledge enhances the interpretability of results and precision of inference. Simulation studies show that the proposed method controls the error rate at the nominal level, and the gain in power over existing methods is substantial in many settings.

a857f0a0ed4c7fee95e17663c6af79ec159a1cab,25-Hydroxyvitamin D in pregnancy and genome wide cord blood DNA methylation in two pregnancy cohorts (MoBa and ALSPAC),"The aim of the study was to investigate whether maternal mid-pregnancy 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with cord blood DNA methylation. DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured in 819 mothers/newborn pairs participating in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) and 597 mothers/newborn pairs participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Across 473,731CpG DNA methylation sites in cord blood DNA, none were strongly associated with maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D after adjusting for multiple tests (false discovery rate (FDR) > 0.5; 473,731 tests). A meta-analysis of the results from both cohorts, using the Fisher method for combining p-values, also did not strengthen findings (FDR > 0.2). Further exploration of a set of CpG sites in the proximity of four a priori defined candidate genes (CYP24A1, CYP27B1, CYP27A1 and CYP2R1) did not result in any associations with FDR < 0.05 (56 tests). In this large genome wide assessment of the potential influence of maternal vitamin D status on DNA methylation, we did not find any convincing associations in 1416 newborns. If true associations do exist, their identification might require much larger consortium studies, expanded genomic coverage, investigation of alternative cell types or measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at different gestational time points.

db6da2ee46c6f4c9da3a8c75c362ee3bf7e4fde6,"Deconvolution, convex optimization, non-parametric empirical Bayes and treatment of non-response","Let $(Y_i,\theta_i)$, $i=1,...,n$, be independent random vectors distributed like $(Y,\theta) \sim G^*$, where the marginal distribution of $\theta$ is completely unknown, and the conditional distribution of $Y$ conditional on $\theta$ is known. It is desired to estimate the marginal distribution of $\theta$ under $G^*$, as well as functionals of the form $E_{G^*} h(Y,\theta)$ for a given $h$, based on the observed $Y_1,...,Y_n$. 
In this paper we suggest a deconvolution method for the above estimation problems and discuss some of its applications in Empirical Bayes analysis. The method involves a quadratic programming step, which is an elaboration on the formulation and technique in Efron(2013). It is computationally efficient and may handle large data sets, where the popular method, of deconvolution using EM-algorithm, is impractical. 
The main application that we study is treatment of non-response. Our approach is nonstandard and does not involve missing at random type of assumptions. The method is demonstrated in simulations, as well as in an analysis of a real data set from the Labor force survey in Israel. Other applications including estimation of the risk, and estimation of False Discovery Rates, are also discussed. 
We also present a method, that involves convex optimization, for constructing confidence intervals for $E_{G^*} h$, under the above setup.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Eitan Greenshtein"", ids = ""2576588""); list(name = ""Theodor Itskov"", ids = ""88860339"")",,25f7719223bcb54c0dafa478f6d73307e9fed007; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ade03d0c772c35dc8e865bdb41d7bc54d5b782d1; a24d330f1b724edc04615f1648d5e9750822cea3; f5da6507c5a424e52fd6ab79d2dd72a44a947bde; 5412be7581819cd36d5123ab7571f336753472e3; 5bc4e3f13c37df1a9bf79276b34439f742177456; f558afeec9667b66995b46e306bcf5aabc2898b5; 87f138206c260a7921d713b9d28be109ffb8d5f6; 17ce798583b90c68c4bcc2e966d62ef1241af240; 7b813e199addc61a3d5148f45a744d2bcd12be5c; 8ab7ff4171cea94ffd22efcc025799c983d7710a; 7234c244a4e560b44ba2e61768b2d4f5de0d40f9; e69e73ff00146a144ddd1d9fcbbd90204a84d93e,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

To compare the transcriptome of cumulus cells associated with a euploid embryo that resulted in live birth with that of a sibling euploid embryo without sustained implantation.


DESIGN
Paired analysis.


SETTING
Academic institution.


PATIENT(S)
Couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection with preimplantation genetic screening with female age â‰¤42Â years and normal ovarian reserve.


INTERVENTION(S)
Transcriptome profiling of cumulus cells from sibling oocytes for correlation with live birth after euploid blastocyst transfer. Embryos were individually cultured to facilitate association with clinical outcomes. The cumulus cell transcriptome from the embryo resulting in live birth was compared with that of its sibling embryo without sustained implantation to investigate potential biomarkers that may aid in embryo selection.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Differential gene expression in cumulus cells associated with a euploid embryo resulting in live birth and its sibling euploid embryo without sustained implantation using next-generation RNA sequencing (RNAseq).


RESULT(S)
Cumulus cell RNAseq of 34 samples (from 17 patients) generated an average of 10.4 Â± 4 Ã— 106 reads per sample. A total of 132 differentially expressed genes between sibling embryos that resulted in a live birth and those that did not were identified (P<.05). However, after correcting for multiple testing none of the genes remained significantly differentially expressed (false discovery rate <.05).


CONCLUSION(S)
The RNAseq profiles were similar between cumulus cells associated with a euploid embryo resulting in live birth and its sibling embryo that did not sustain implantation. The cumulus cell transcriptome is not predictive of live birth within an individual patient's cohort of euploid embryos.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Katherine A.

67d553a7a3559e98fecd4368497c00cc2ff82ee2,Biomarker adaptive designs in clinical trials,"Predictive biomarkers are used to develop (binary) classifiers to identify patients as either good or poor candidates for clinical decision to optimize treatment selection. Ideally, these candidate biomarkers have been well studied in the phase II developmental stage, the performance characteristics of the classifier are well established in one or more retrospective validation, and the assay and predictive performance are reproducible and robust experimentally and analytically. However, completely phase II validated biomarkers for uses in phase III trial are often unavailable. Adaptive signature design (ASD) combines the biomarker identification and classifier development to the selection of candidate patients and a statistical test for treatment effect on the selected patient subgroup for phase III clinical trials. Biomarker-adaptive designs identify the most suitable target subpopulations, based on clinical observations or known biomarkers, and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment on that subpopulation in a statistically valid manner.

6ac1df616279dff663bdd8a6e5c0cc554791cf91,Modified maternal ECG cancellation for portable fetal heart rate monitor,"Abstract This letter presents an efficient algorithm to detect fetal heart rates based on linear template subtraction (TS) for portable fetal heart rate monitors. After pre-processing, the covariance function windowing is used to eliminate maternal P-waves, maternal T-waves, baseline wander, and to enhance maternal R-waves and fetal R-waves. Next, fetal ECG is extracted by the modified mECG cancellation method which forms a mECG template by projecting an average maternal R-wave as a basis into exponential domains. Finally, fetal R-peaks are detected using a 2-D phase space matrix. The results show that the true positive rate, false discovery rate, and false negative rate of the proposed method are 86.80%, 5.78%, 13.20% respectively, which are better than those of other single-channel fetal ECG template extraction methods. It turns out that the modified template subtraction method has three main advantages. First, the covariance function windowing easily removes baseline wander, maternal P waves and maternal T waves. Second, the modified mECG cancellation model can extract overlapping signals without causing large waveform distortions. Last, both covariance function windowing and the modified mECG cancellation model are efficient and can operate in real time.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sheng-Yang Tsui"", ids = ""39569889""); list(name = ""Chien-Sheng Liu"", ids = ""2991853""); list(name = ""Chii-Wann Lin"", ids = ""51250458"")",f72a76619a8900066d8b730bab4a064996f8af0e; fb15662df7e6b88077bb3e5894e35639b2065c5a; a4703fb26d5321793c9b5a75d16eaa6cfddaf2f8; bb77cbb1750bd6950fc40416960873917591dd8f,ba1ced1f26aa2bf8da0e2758b0cd408239bcf3ac; dc1f7da8501a9c49c01e26c72e2741ffca31a526; 8a586f1ff8d4ef25519d1f1c0da342d496b7864f; dbd13405f7e33adf1dad6925affd1ceb33fc89c0; a7a21f08bce304e86297fcbe53b245eee34d912f; 27d0b543b72c4b3c5e90e3a57cbb38ff21d55b6b; eb546be2361672aa715bb2b15a2bc3a137d1ec2c; aed8a7cdfec150e506df42ae57829550e0740d6b; 7da7988bc48c0c113deb9a6e27a8f52ba8f86581; d8f7d8d371c59301e19b51cebc8a17b8f807f238; a469f1ab87fd60bdea07d2a52ad6255613a4f456; 911383ffa1b2395fa9717db7106bb3f961494098; cf8632784d28c528821b313f05ec935022a03df5; 3698436fbdbd50e59103f5296063edb5e61b38fc; 6062fc113fc9d9f6a51952ad2fdf28d5eff63c25; cd2e064bd3c1f9e123ff48431650ef395056bd57; 2cd2cb95dc1434d79c6d0200851f8858ecca1ab9; bc32313c5b10212233007ebb38e214d713db99f9; 1044858e8968e63684506ee16242a96c42aa73f9; 3b81b5de29553312ea3a4fc9127dcb774916c62f; 1ee0160f0f08e495deff6883d704cf0923633062; 91b458dcf0e55c7345681d1d17f114e79f659a44,Biomed.

2a0a39bcc4382aa33baf3b421c68326cb0e4ed76,Multi-reference spectral library yields almost complete coverage of heterogeneous LC-MS/MS data sets,"Spectral libraries play a central role in the analysis of data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics experiments. DIA experiments require spectral libraries, as most current methods cannot apply traditional peptide identification via database searching on DIA data. A central assumption in current spectral library tools is that a single characteristic intensity pattern (CIP) suffices to describe the fragmentation of an unmodified peptide in a particular parent ion charge state (peptide charge pair). However, we find that this is often not the case. We analyze a heterogeneous dataset of 440.000 MaxQuant - preprocessed peptide spectra from a QToF mass spectrometer, stemming from over 100 different LC-MS/MS runs. The dataset corresponds to 10.580 peptide charge pairs, which have each been measured and identified at least 20 times. We demonstrate that the same charged and unmodified peptide can fragment in multiple reproducible ways, even within the same LC-MS/MS run. We integrate multiple reference CIPs (MCIPs) in our model library and observe a >99% coverage of replicate fragmentation spectra for 95% of peptide charge pairs (using up to four CIPs). Using a single CIP (as in current spectral library approaches), we find >99% coverage for only 50% of the peptide charge pairs. Our approach achieves substantially greater sensitivity in comparison to the popular SpectraST library generation tool. Using randomized decoy spectra, we demonstrate that identification accuracy of the MCIP approach is improved by up to 12% compared to a single CIP approach. We test the MCIP approach on a SWATH data set and observe a âˆ¼30% increase in peptide recognition. We conclude that including MCIPs in spectral library approaches would yield increased sensitivity without compromising the false discovery rate.

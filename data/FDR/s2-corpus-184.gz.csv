ea0d68634040de0c724d5a1821762f9a5a059dbb,Transcriptome sequencing study implicates immune-related genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia: new data and a meta-analysis,"We undertook an RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-based transcriptomic profiling study on lymphoblastoid cell lines of a European ancestry sample of 529 schizophrenia cases and 660 controls, and found 1058 genes to be differentially expressed by affection status. These differentially expressed genes were enriched for involvement in immunity, especially the 697 genes with higher expression in cases. Comparing the current RNAseq transcriptomic profiling to our previous findings in an array-based study of 268 schizophrenia cases and 446 controls showed a highly significant positive correlation over all genes. Fifteen (18%) of the 84 genes with significant (false discovery rate<0.05) expression differences between cases and controls in the previous study and analyzed here again were differentially expressed by affection status here at a genome-wide significance level (Bonferroni P<0.05 adjusted for 8141 analyzed genes in total, or P<~6.1 Ã— 10âˆ’6), all with the same direction of effect, thus providing corroborative evidence despite each sample of fully independent subjects being studied by different technological approaches. Meta-analysis of the RNAseq and array data sets (797 cases and 1106 controls) showed 169 additional genes (besides those found in the primary RNAseq-based analysis) to be differentially expressed, and provided further evidence of immune gene enrichment. In addition to strengthening our previous array-based gene expression differences in schizophrenia cases versus controls and providing transcriptomic support for some genes implicated by other approaches for schizophrenia, our study detected new genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia. We highlight RNAseq-based differential expression of various genes involved in neurodevelopment and/or neuronal function, and discuss caveats of the approach.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""A R Sanders"", ids = ""47716749""); list(name = ""Eugene I.

4f893dc4ffe26a8bcc407a175b67176b2a41eac7,Co-Existence of LMPP-Like and GMP-Like Leukemia Stem Cells In Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Abstract 91 In normal and leukemic hemopoiesis, stem cells differentiate through intermediate progenitors into terminal cells. In human Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), there is uncertainty about: (i) whether there is more than one leukemic stem cell (LSC) population in any one individual patient; (ii) how homogeneous AML LSCs populations are at a molecular and cellular level and (iii) the relationship between AML LSCs and normal stem/progenitor populations. Answers to these questions will clarify the molecular pathways important in the stepwise transformation of normal HSCs/progenitors. We have studied 82 primary human CD34+ AML samples (spanning a range of FAB subtypes, cytogenetic categories and FLT3 and NPM1 mutation states) and 8 age-matched control marrow samples. In âˆ¼80% of AML cases, two expanded populations with hemopoietic progenitor immunophenotype coexist in most patients. One population is CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA+ (CD38-CD45RA+) and the other CD34+CD38+CD110-CD45RA+ (GMP-like). Both populations from 7/8 patients have leukemic stem cell (LSC) activity in primary and secondary xenograft assays with no LSC activity in CD34- compartment. The two CD34+ LSC populations are hierarchically ordered, with CD38-CD45RA+ LSC giving rise to CD38+CD45RA+ LSC in vivo and in vitro. Limit dilution analysis shows that CD38-CD45RA+LSCs are more potent by 8â€“10 fold. From 18 patients, we isolated both CD38-CD45RA+ and GMP-like LSC populations. Global mRNA expression profiles of FACS-sorted CD38-CD45RA+ and GMP-like populations from the same patient allowed comparison of the two populations within each patient (negating the effect of genetic/epigenetic changes between patients). Using a paired t-test, 748 genes were differentially expressed between CD38-CD45RA+ and GMP-like LSCs and separated the two populations in most patients in 3D PCA. This was confirmed by independent quantitative measures of difference in gene expression using a non-parametric rank product analysis with a false discovery rate of 0.01. Thus, the two AML LSC populations are molecularly distinct. We then compared LSC profiles with those from 4 different adult marrow normal stem/progenitor cells to identify the normal stem/progenitor cell populations which the two AML LSC populations are most similar to at a molecular level. We first obtained a 2626 gene set by ANOVA, that maximally distinguished normal stem and progenitor populations. Next, the expression profiles of 22 CD38-CD45RA+ and 21 GMP-like AML LSC populations were distributed by 3D PCA using this ANOVA gene set. This showed that AML LSCs were most closely related to their normal counterpart progenitor population and not normal HSC. This data was confirmed quantitatively by a classifier analysis and hierarchical clustering. Taken together, the two LSC populations are hierarchically ordered, molecularly distinct and their gene expression profiles do not map most closely to normal HSCs but rather to their counterpart normal progenitor populations. Finally, as global expression profiles of CD38-CD45RA+ AML LSC resemble normal CD38-CD45RA+ cells, we defined the functional potential of these normal cells. This had not been previously determined. Using colony and limiting dilution liquid culture assays, we showed that single normal CD38-CD45RA+ cells have granulocyte and macrophage (GM), lymphoid (T and B cell) but not megakaryocyte-erythroid (MK-E) potential. Furthermore, gene expression studies on 10 cells showed that CD38-CD45RA+ cells express lymphoid and GM but not Mk-E genes. Taken together, normal CD38-CD45RA+ cells are most similar to mouse lymphoid primed multi-potential progenitor cells (LMPP) cells and distinct from the recently identified human Macrophage Lymphoid progenitor (MLP) population. In summary, for the first time, we show the co-existence of LMPP-like and GMP-like LSCs in CD34+ AML. Thus, CD34+ AML is a progenitor disease where LSCs have acquired abnormal self-renewal potential (Figure 1). Going forward, this work provides a platform for determining pathological LSCs self-renewal and tracking LSCs post treatment, both of which will impact on leukemia biology and therapy.

e08f6172b7f792d70bb69cd4aa2876703279d0ef,Genome-wide association studies for feedlot and growth traits in cattle.,"A genome wide-association study for production traits in cattle was carried out using genotype data from the 10K Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) and the 50K Illumina (San Diego, CA) SNP chips. The results for residual feed intake (RFI), BW, and hip height in 3 beef breed types (Bos indicus, Bos taurus, and B. indicus Ã— B. taurus), and for stature in dairy cattle, are presented. The aims were to discover SNP associated with all traits studied, but especially RFI, and further to test the consistency of SNP effects across different cattle populations and breed types. The data were analyzed within data sets and within breed types by using a mixed model and fitting 1 SNP at a time. In each case, the number of significant SNP was more than expected by chance alone. A total of 75 SNP from the reference population with 50K chip data were significant (P < 0.001) for RFI, with a false discovery rate of 68%. These 75 SNP were mapped on 24 different BTA. Of the 75 SNP, the 9 most significant SNP were detected on BTA 3, 5, 7, and 8, with P â‰¤ 6.0 Ã— 10(-5). In a population of Angus cattle divergently selected for high and low RFI and 10K chip data, 111 SNP were significantly (P < 0.001) associated with RFI, with a false discovery rate of 7%. Approximately 103 of these SNP were therefore likely to represent true positives. Because of the small number of SNP common to both the 10K and 50K SNP chips, only 27 SNP were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with RFI in the 2 populations. However, other chromosome regions were found that contained SNP significantly associated with RFI in both data sets, although no SNP within the region showed a consistent effect on RFI. The SNP effects were consistent between data sets only when estimated within the same breed type.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunduimijid Bolormaa"", ids = ""4607755""); list(name = ""Ben J.

Using all funds, we find a relatively high FDR for the best funds of 32.8% (at a 5% significance level), which implies that only around 3.7% of all funds truly outperform their benchmarks. For the worst funds the FDR is relatively small at 7.6% which results in 22% of funds which truly underperform their benchmarks. For different investment styles, this pattern of very few genuine winner funds is repeated for all companies, small companies and equity income funds. Forming portfolios of funds recursively for which the FDR is controlled at a â€˜acceptableâ€™ value, produces no performance persistence for positive alpha funds and weak evidence of persistence for negative alpha funds.",2012,Economics,"list(name = ""Keith Cuthbertson"", ids = ""49922157""); list(name = ""Dirk Nitzsche"", ids = ""4349129""); list(name = ""Niall O'Sullivan"", ids = ""1397935856"")",2f26bf38555ac9ee997250847831d5af28b35c7b; 0ef77e4637b091aa499c1a3202de676761aa6e21; c2c0825517b0be01bbae8a7a3ad8d61cd1cbf409; c472d86062f23b3eaaa2121a33f34511f2b10031; 9b1adb567fafda44d6dc8eeadcbbf0d6a09b2738; 30577e7dbf0277d7b029284938995d23673b2d3e; 67b6a1a1fab551f4528b767032324ab7753dc61e; 8fc719e4d1ebcdea10bf51e221fa15d6e79925a8,d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9; c7a9688d2f09a759e5ba5b68fead2059fda7ff49; fe27c5357eaf6fe49033be18015d2582963956c9; 582b4ea0800321a26702816a306f3d54265fe4e9; 994d97feb66952ed597b9a0d17b07a8bec51a7d8; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e2a1e69aaa98e8146d637d121e8eed5857a24f49; 9b497ef81fed619937ff7e08c47fb8edbd9f19bb; d6a17b605faf4e0575bae74dcc2a5e19eedc2935; 77b13d76a6281e3969fb7bbb9dbe2d26eb6e1c3f; 4d7faa77617a4b5e8c1a65c06056cfa364e8aac0; 990c709cc04d22a448986a3b560f63d9290f39d1; 65f768de9ee541da519d00f77c8e56d0731fb10b; 865b1607a955f9fca1b46425a4c10e8fa79e3397; 1dd0d853aa937f0adbc8007db88c94c62bbf81e9; b85183a90ed8fb0d6cebc1d3f98300ffb0394c97; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 83a23881d19998f0b06c8c45624a33bb5909c91b; 7fbad780ed5f1bda63ca6a6fce19139a11e8f533; f0d77a2a8a2604702d418256293af3e0583f4d56; c7d50f23fc12473c4bad81ffb50cd096527af5be; 75f8a4d7ed6a0f32fa098cac967de247938d9ce5; 4cf01507070ef68e7bbf5c9421b21d4ede10feac; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 00d2968bc2ea4c3ba79cca930cd12ebd0d32b9ad,European Financial Management,18,444-463
7b6e65dcdffa1916e7767e25518c03f6847bee46,Comparative antigen-induced gene expression profiles unveil novel aspects of susceptibility/resistance to adjuvant arthritis in rats.,"Lewis (LEW) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats of the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype (RT.1(l)) display differential susceptibility to adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). LEW are susceptible while WKY are resistant to AIA. To gain insights into the mechanistic basis of these disparate outcomes, we compared the gene expression profiles of the draining lymph node cells (LNC) of these two rat strains early (day 7) following a potentially arthritogenic challenge. LNC were tested both ex vivo and after restimulation with the disease-related antigen, mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65. Biotin-labeled fragment cRNA was generated from RNA of LNC and then hybridized with an oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray chip. The differentially expressed genes (DEG) were compared by limiting the false discovery rate to <5% and fold change â‰¥2.0, and their association with quantitative trait loci (QTL) was analyzed. This analysis revealed overall a more active immune response in WKY than LEW rats. Important differences were observed in the association of DEG with QTL in LEW vs. WKY rats. Both the number of upregulated DEG associated with rat arthritis-QTL and their level of expression were relatively higher in LEW when compared to WKY rat; however, the number of downregulated DEG-associated with rat arthritis-QTL as well as AIA-QTL were found to be higher in WKY than in LEW rats. In conclusion, distinct gene expression profiles define arthritis-susceptible versus resistant phenotype of MHC-compatible inbred rats. These results would advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis and might also offer potential novel targets for therapeutic purposes.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hua Yu"", ids = ""49514792""); list(name = ""Changwan Lu"", ids = ""7434159""); list(name = ""Ming Tan"", ids = ""144158078""); list(name = ""Kamal D.

GSE31262 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including five neural stem cells samples from normal human and nine stem cells samples from glioma patients. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with Multtest package and Limma package of R language, and false discovery rate 1 were chosen as cut-off criterion. Hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using pheatmap package of R language and KOBAS software, respectively. miRNAs related to up- and down-regulated DEGs were, respectively, predicted by WebGestalt software and its miRNAs-target DEGs interaction network were, respectively, constructed by STRING database. Bingo plug-in in Cytoscape software was applied to analyze Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis for up- and down-regulated DEGs in network, respectively. A total of 428 DEGs were selected, including 331 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated DEGs. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that glioma samples and normal samples were completely separated. Pathway analysis indicated that CDK2 and WEE1 participated in the cell cycle. miR-124 could simultaneously regulate up-regulated (ELAVL1 and EZH2) and down-regulated (BACE1) DEGs. The down-regulated genes (KIF23, WEE1 and CDK2) were associated with cell division, while the up-regulated genes (PLP1 and MBP) were related to myelination of neurons. miR-124 might participate in development of glioma by regulating BACE1, ELAVL1 and EZH2.

274a7cee3869bbdfecd3e239f3f168a55c8f03bf,GroupTest : Multiple Testing Procedure for Grouped Hypotheses,"In the modern Big Data analysis, testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously has been an important tool in analyzing data arising from scientific studies, such as genetics, astronomy, social sciences and many others. The hypotheses can often be grouped together according to the nature of the scientific investigations. For instance, genes can be grouped according to gene pathways; the nearby pixels in an image can be grouped together. The sparsity appears in both betweenand within-group levels. Namely, only a small number of groups are significant and a small number of hypotheses within a significant group are significant. To fully incorporate the group information, Liu, Sarkar, and Zhao (2015) proposed the BSG model, described in Section 2. They have further provided a methodology for testing these grouped hypothesis, controlling the total posterior false discovery rate and within-group false discover rate.

Few candidate genes related to soundness traits have been identified in the pig.MethodsIn this study, 2066 commercial females were scored for 17 traits describing body conformation and FL structure, and were used for association analyses. Genotyping of 121 SNPs derived from 95 genes was implemented using Sequenom's MassARRAY system.ResultsBased on the association results from single trait and principal components using mixed linear model analyses and false discovery rate testing, it was observed that APOE, BMP8, CALCR, COL1A2, COL9A1, DKFZ, FBN1 and VDBP were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with body conformation traits. The genes ALOX5, BMP8, CALCR, OPG, OXTR and WNT16 were very highly significantly (P < 0.001) associated with FL structures, and APOE, CALCR, COL1A2, GNRHR, IHH, MTHFR and WNT16 were highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with overall leg action. Strong linkage disequilibrium between CALCR and COL1A2 on SSC9 was detected, and haplotype -ACGACC- was highly significantly (P < 0.01) associated with overall leg action and several important FL soundness traits.ConclusionThe present findings provide a comprehensive list of candidate genes for further use in fine mapping and biological functional analyses.",2008,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bin Fan"", ids = ""145211788""); list(name = ""Suneel Kumar Onteru"", ids = ""6557365""); list(name = ""Benny E Mote"", ids = ""4120135""); list(name = ""T.

Here we combine low-coverage (0.15Ã—) sequencing with a new method to impute the ancestral haplotype space in 1,887 commercially available outbred mice. We mapped 156 unique quantitative trait loci for 92 phenotypes at a 5% false discovery rate. Gene-level mapping resolution was achieved at about one-fifth of the loci, implicating Unc13c and Pgc1a at loci for the quality of sleep, Adarb2 for home cage activity, Rtkn2 for intensity of reaction to startle, Bmp2 for wound healing, Il15 and Id2 for several T cell measures and Prkca for bone mineral content.

6993e4b1f750f1968f848e6dc10bdc770d496a45,MGAS: a powerful tool for multivariate gene-based genome-wide association analysis,"MOTIVATION
Standard genome-wide association studies, testing the association between one phenotype and a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are limited in two ways: (i) traits are often multivariate, and analysis of composite scores entails loss in statistical power and (ii) gene-based analyses may be preferred, e.g. to decrease the multiple testing problem.


RESULTS
Here we present a new method, multivariate gene-based association test by extended Simes procedure (MGAS), that allows gene-based testing of multivariate phenotypes in unrelated individuals. Through extensive simulation, we show that under most trait-generating genotype-phenotype models MGAS has superior statistical power to detect associated genes compared with gene-based analyses of univariate phenotypic composite scores (i.e. GATES, multiple regression), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Re-analysis of metabolic data revealed 32 False Discovery Rate controlled genome-wide significant genes, and 12 regions harboring multiple genes; of these 44 regions, 30 were not reported in the original analysis.


CONCLUSION
MGAS allows researchers to conduct their multivariate gene-based analyses efficiently, and without the loss of power that is often associated with an incorrectly specified genotype-phenotype models.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
MGAS is freely available in KGG v3.0 (http://statgenpro.psychiatry.hku.hk/limx/kgg/download.php). Access to the metabolic dataset can be requested at dbGaP (https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The R-simulation code is available from http://ctglab.nl/people/sophie_van_der_sluis.

fd253d3e8eea337b704c5586d3895eeba1fb2d8c,In-Search Assignment of Monoisotopic Peaks Improves the Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides,"Cross-linking/mass spectrometry has undergone a maturation process akin to standard proteomics by adapting key methods such as false discovery rate control and quantification. A poorly evaluated search setting in proteomics is the consideration of multiple (lighter) alternative values for the monoisotopic precursor mass to compensate for possible misassignments of the monoisotopic peak. Here, we show that monoisotopic peak assignment is a major weakness of current data handling approaches in cross-linking. Cross-linked peptides often have high precursor masses, which reduces the presence of the monoisotopic peak in the isotope envelope. Paired with generally low peak intensity, this generates a challenge that may not be completely solvable by precursor mass assignment routines. We therefore took an alternative route by '""in-search assignment of the monoisotopic peak"" in the cross-link database search tool Xi (Xi-MPA), which considers multiple precursor masses during database search. We compare and evaluate the performance of established preprocessing workflows that partly correct the monoisotopic peak and Xi-MPA on three publicly available data sets. Xi-MPA always delivered the highest number of identifications with âˆ¼2 to 4-fold increase of PSMs without compromising identification accuracy as determined by FDR estimation and comparison to crystallographic models.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Swantje Lenz"", ids = ""81629870""); list(name = ""Sven H.

1a41bb055a1b24b7ed65512a8241bfce09c5501f,"Circulating bile acids in healthy adults respond differently to a dietary pattern characterized by whole grains, legumes and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars: A randomized, controlled, crossover feeding study.","OBJECTIVE
The effects of diets high in refined grains on biliary and colonic bile acids have been investigated extensively. However, the effects of diets high in whole versus refined grains on circulating bile acids, which can influence glucose homeostasis and inflammation through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5), have not been studied.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled crossover feeding trial (NCT00622661) in 80 healthy adults (40 women/40 men, age 18-45â€¯years) from the greater Seattle Area, half of which were normal weight (BMI 18.5-25.0â€¯kg/m2) and half overweight to obese (BMI 28.0-39.9â€¯kg/m2). Participants consumed two four-week controlled diets in randomized order: 1) a whole grain diet (WG diet), designed to be low in glycemic load (GL), high in whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables, and 2) a refined grain diet (RG diet), designed to be high GL, high in refined grains and added sugars, separated by a four-week washout period. Quantitative targeted analysis of 55 bile acid species in fasting plasma was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, and CRP were measured in fasting serum. Linear mixed models were used to test the effects of diet on bile acid concentrations, and determine the association between plasma bile acid concentrations and HOMA-IR and CRP. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR)â€¯<â€¯0.05 was used to control for multiple testing.


RESULTS
A total of 29 plasma bile acids were reliably detected and retained for analysis. Taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), taurocholic acid (TCA) and glycocholic acid (GCA) were statistically significantly higher after the WG compared to the RG diet (FDRâ€¯<â€¯0.05). There were no significant differences by BMI or sex. When evaluating the association of bile acids and HOMA-IR, GCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), 5Î²â€‘cholanic acidâ€‘3Î²,12Î±â€‘diol, 5â€‘cholanic acidâ€‘3Î²â€‘ol, and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) were statistically significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR individually, and as a group, total, 12Î±â€‘hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile acids were also significant (FDRâ€¯<â€¯0.05). When stratifying by BMI, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), cholic acid (CA), UDCA, 5Î²-cholanic acid-3Î², deoxycholic acid, and total, 12Î±-hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile acid groups were significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR among overweight to obese individuals (FDRâ€¯<â€¯0.05). When stratifying by sex, GCA, CDCA, TCA, CA, UDCA, GDCA, glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), total, primary, 12Î±â€‘hydroxylated, and glycine-conjugated bile acids were significantly associated with HOMA-IR among women, and CDCA, GDCA, and GLCA were significantly associated among men (FDRâ€¯<â€¯0.05). There were no significant associations between bile acids and CRP.


CONCLUSIONS
Diets with comparable macronutrient and energy composition, but differing in carbohydrate source, affected fasting plasma bile acids differently.

d1664b34006ec291720f5dceea0ec520b159fe72,Signalling Pathways Have Different Expression Profiles in Human Platelets Isolated from Men and Women.,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of death for men and women in the U.S. Platelets play a central role in the inflammation and coagulation mechanisms responsible for these disorders, and anti-platelet drugs are therefore the current mainstays in prevention and therapy. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in normal and abnormal platelet function using proteomic techniques offers a novel strategic approach to the discovery of potential new therapeutic targets.

Hypothesis: The incidence and outcomes of cardiovascular disease are profoundly dependent on gender, and it is possible that differences in platelet signaling mechanisms may contribute to these disparities. We have therefore hypothesized that the platelet signaling proteome is gender-specific.

Methods: Platelets were isolated and purified from four normal adult male and four normal adult female donors under an IRB-approved protocol. Conventional 2D-gel electrophoresis (2DGE) and mass spectrometry were used to profile the high abundance platelet proteome. Antibody microarrays, bearing 507 monoclonal antibodies against low abundance proteins involved in signaling pathways and related functions, were used to interrogate the lower abundance platelet. Western blots were used to validate a subset of the data.

Results: Discovery studies with 2DGE revealed at least nineteen lower abundance proteins which could be significantly distinguished on the basis of gender (P<0.05). Two of these proteins, a thrombopoeitin-activated G-protein component (#1101) and a megakaryocyte-relevant co-factor for DNA synthesis (#1583), were selectively elevated in male platelets. Concurrent studies on the sensitive antibody microarray platform revealed that more than 420 proteins were significantly expressed in a gender-specific manner (P<0.05). Of these, 62 remained significant by the stringent criterion of a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of <10% (SAM Algorithm, 2000 permutations). By rank-ordering the proteins by expression level, we found that platelets from normal male and female donors were significantly and uniquely enriched in different signaling proteins. These gender-specific signaling proteins included IL-1beta, and specific isoforms of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), PLC (phospholipase C), and PKC (protein kinase C). Western blot analysis validated a subset of the differentially expressed platelet proteome.

Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that the platelet signaling proteome is gender-specific. We interpret these data to indicate that gender-specific differences in the platelet signaling proteome may contribute to the gender-specific disparity in outcomes for cardiovascular diseases in men and women.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Stephen W.

fec45faaf19b080f30d5089e68a98b6ab6b05ac5,Using Targeted Enrichment RNA Sequencing in the Diagnosis of Hematologic Neoplasms in Fresh and Paraffin-Embedded Tissue,"Introduction: RNA profiling using microarray has been used extensively in cancer research, but its clinical utilization remains limited due to its poor reproducibility and difficulty in standardization. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have advanced significantly in accuracy, reproducibility and simplicity. Targeted enrichment of RNA and NGS sequencing provides a reliable and reproducible approach for RNA profiling that is amenable to implementation in clinical laboratories. We explored using this approach in evaluating the utility of targeted enrichment RNA NGS sequencing in the diagnosis of various hematologic neoplasms. Methods: RNA from fresh bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from patients with ALL (N=29), AML (N=18), and CLL (N=25) and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from DLBCL (N=79), sarcoma (N=12) and various epithelial tumors (N=22). We used the TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA) for detecting the expression of 1385 genes. The results were standardized so the expression values had mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Fusions and mutations were not considered in this analysis. Results: The generated expression profiles provided simple data on various disease markers including CD3 , CD19 , CD8 and PAX5 that can be used directly for distinguishing between diseases. However, using statistical analysis we were able to distinguish between various diseases with high accuracy. We first focused on classifying ALL vs AML vs CLL since fresh samples were used in generating the expression data on these samples. Accounting for multiple hypothesis testing and setting false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05, we found 1074 genes as statistically significant. Using the top 5 principal components, we can build a multinomial logit model with 93.1% accuracy rate based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Using a tree model with only FANCI and CIITA genes levels, we were able to diagnose ALL, AML, and CLL with an 88.9% accuracy rate also based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Similarly for the three FFPE groups (DLBCL, solid epithelial tumor, and sarcoma), setting FDR at 0.05 resulted in 1169 genes that were significantly different across the three groups. Using the top 5 principal components, we can build a multinomial logit model with a 92.0% accuracy rate on the leave-one-out testing. Using a simple tree model and the expression levels of CD79A and MALAT1 genes, we were able to distinguish between the three groups with a 94.7% accuracy rate on leave-one-out testing. Mixing FFPE with fresh tissue samples and analyzing all 6 groups, we found 1361 genes significantly by setting FDR at 0.05 to account for multiple hypothesis testing. A multinomial logit model with the top 5 principal components provided 89.7% accuracy in classifying the 6 disease using the leave-one-out testing. Conclusion: This data suggests that using targeted enrichment RNA sequencing and quantifying the expression of genes provide reliable data that can be used for distinguishing between various diseases. This is applicable to fresh and FFPE tissue. This approach also provides information on fusion genes and mutations. While these sources of information were not used in this model, they can provide additional important information not only to improve the model, but also to provide information on prognosis and potential response to therapy.

5b1acc92e8eee4556a84ab7ebc6230794a55c93a,Fast open modification spectral library searching through approximate nearest neighbor indexing,"Open modification searching (OMS) is a powerful search strategy that identifies peptides carrying any type of modification by allowing a modified spectrum to match against its unmodified variant by using a very wide precursor mass window. A drawback of this strategy, however, is that it leads to a large increase in search time. Although performing an open search can be done using existing spectral library search engines by simply setting a wide precursor mass window, none of these tools have been optimized for OMS, leading to excessive runtimes and suboptimal identification results. Here we present the ANN-SoLo tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. ANN-SoLo uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up OMS by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. This approach is combined with a cascade search strategy to maximize the number of identified unmodified and modified spectra while strictly controlling the false discovery rate, as well as a shifted dot product score to sensitively match modified spectra to their unmodified counterparts. ANN-SoLo outperforms the state-of-the-art SpectraST spectral library search engine both in terms of speed and the number of identifications. On a previously published human cell line data set, ANN-SoLo confidently identifies 40 % more spectra than SpectraST while achieving a speedup of an order of magnitude.

c9033a2fc01a8f838950f6f5e11a8939f817e135,Extensive transcriptomic study emphasizes importance of vesicular transport in C9orf72 expansion carriers,"The majority of the clinico-pathological variability observed in patients harboring a repeat expansion in the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex subunit (C9orf72) remains unexplained. This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72-related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with (nâ€‰=â€‰34) or without (nâ€‰=â€‰44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects (nâ€‰=â€‰24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰<â€‰0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDRâ€‰=â€‰1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [CDKL1]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [EEF2K]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [SGSM3]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator (SGSM3) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72-linked diseases.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dennis W.

a772ec7fd87ca4821da7832e049c79646ad2dd7d,Gene expression pathways of high grade localized prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Despite advances in screening and local therapy, prostate cancer remains the second most common cause of cancer related death among American men, with those having high grade disease being at highest risk for prostate cancer mortality. Here we identify the genes and cellular pathways that distinguish high grade from low grade pathologically localized prostate cancer.


METHODS
Cancer cells from low grade (Gleason 3â€‰+â€‰3â€‰=â€‰6) or high grade (4â€‰+â€‰4â€‰=â€‰8) tumors of men with localized disease were isolated by laser capture micro-dissection. Expression profiling was conducted across 18,344 unique annotated genes and data were analyzed using packages from the R/Bioconductor project to determine differential gene expression and perform gene set enrichment analysis. Publically available expression data was retrieved and analyzed individually in the same manner and in cross platform meta-analyses.


RESULTS
Six hundred seventy genes were differentially expressed between Gleason sum 6 and 8 tumors with a false discovery rate of <5% (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0014) including genes previously shown to mediate prostate cancer survival, proliferation, and metastasis. Functional themes associated with Gleason grade included developmental processes, signal transduction, chemokine and embryonic stem cell pathways with specific enrichment of the androgen receptor, EGFR, TNF-alpha, and Notch signaling cascades.


CONCLUSIONS
In addition to androgen receptor signaling, growth factor, and cytokine mediated pathways are active in clinically localized high grade prostate cancer. The availability of therapeutics that selectively target these pathways encourages the development of clinical trials for their selective use in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting in men at high risk for disease progression.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashley E.

e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484,Operating characteristics and extensions of the false discovery rate procedure,"We investigate the operating characteristics of the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate procedure for multiple testing. This is a distribution-free method that controls the expected fraction of falsely rejected null hypotheses among those rejected. The paper provides a framework for understanding more about this procedure. We first study the asymptotic properties of the `deciding point' ""D"" that determines the critical ""p""-value. From this, we obtain explicit asymptotic expressions for a particular risk function. We introduce the dual notion of false non-rejections and we consider a risk function that combines the false discovery rate and false non-rejections. We also consider the optimal procedure with respect to a measure of conditional risk. Copyright 2002 Royal Statistical Society.",2002,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Christopher R.

c56aeeddf23e47756d7dd6e2ed89830ed3749a71,Adipose depot gene expression and intelectin-1 in the metabolic response tocancer and cachexia.,"BACKGROUND
Cancer cachexia is a poorly understood metabolic consequence of cancer. During cachexia, different adipose depots demonstrate differential wasting rates. Animal models suggest adipose tissue may be a key driver of muscle wasting through fat-muscle crosstalk, but human studies in this area are lacking. We performed global gene expression profiling of visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose from weight stable and cachectic cancer patients and healthy controls.


METHODS
Cachexia was defined as >2% weight loss plus low computed tomography-muscularity. Biopsies of SAT and VAT were taken from patients undergoing resection for oesophago-gastric cancer, and healthy controls (n = 16 and 8 respectively). RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. cDNA was hybridised to the Affymetrix Clariom S microarray and data analysed using R/Bioconductor. Differential expression of genes was assessed using empirical Bayes and moderated-t-statistic approaches. Category enrichment analysis was used with a tissue-specific background to examine the biological context of differentially expressed genes. Selected differentially regulated genes were validated by qPCR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for intelectin-1 was performed on all VAT samples. The previously-described cohort plus 12 additional patients from each group also had plasma I = intelectin-1 ELISA carried out.


RESULTS
In VAT vs. SAT comparisons, there were 2101, 1722, and 1659 significantly regulated genes in the cachectic, weight stable, and control groups, respectively. There were 2200 significantly regulated genes from VAT in cachectic patients compared with controls. Genes involving inflammation were enriched in cancer and control VAT vs. SAT, although different genes contributed to enrichment in each group. Energy metabolism, fat browning (e.g. uncoupling protein 1), and adipogenesis genes were down-regulated in cancer VAT (P = 0.043, P = 5.4 Ã— 10-6 and P = 1 Ã— 10-6 respectively). The gene showing the largest difference in expression was ITLN1, the gene that encodes for intelectin-1 (false discovery rate-corrected P = 0.0001), a novel adipocytokine associated with weight loss in other contexts.


CONCLUSIONS
SAT and VAT have unique gene expression signatures in cancer and cachexia. VAT is metabolically active in cancer, and intelectin-1 may be a target for therapeutic manipulation. VAT may play a fundamental role in cachexia, but the down-regulation of energy metabolism genes implies a limited role for fat browning in cachectic patients, in contrast to pre-clinical models.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Janice G.

911482afe3b62d42aa60a18e88840890b141795c,Variations in circadian genes and individual nocturnal symptoms of insomnia. The HUNT study.,"Insomnia is a condition characterized by three nocturnal symptoms: problems with sleep onset or maintenance and early morning awakenings (terminal insomnia). Affected individuals may present one or more of these symptoms. Several studies have shown that insomnia is moderately heritable and that proxy phenotypes for the three insomnia symptoms show different heritabilities. This suggests that different nocturnal symptoms of insomnia may arise from different genetic and biological backgrounds. Circadian genes are good candidates to account for these differences as they regulate the periodicity of several physiological functions including sleep. Evidence from studies in animals and humans have suggested that circadian genes might be involved in sleep disturbances such as insomnia. In this study, we investigated the association between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in circadian genes and individual symptoms of insomnia and their combinations using data from the Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study 3 (the HUNT3 study, N = 50807). Participants (N = 6029) provided information about sleep onset insomnia, maintenance insomnia, and terminal insomnia. Participants who responded ""several times a week"" to at least one question regarding the mentioned symptoms were classified as cases (N = 3577) and categorized in seven subgroups according to possible symptom combinations. Controls (N = 2452) answered ""Never/Seldom"" to all sleep-related questions. Using multinomial regression, we assessed 73 SNPs in nine circadian genes (PER1, 2, 3, CRY1, 2, TIMELESS, CLOCK, REV-ERBÎ±, ARNTL) for differences among symptoms subgroups. Twenty-five SNPs showed significant p-values and supportive odds-ratios. All significant SNPs in PER3 were associated with reporting all three symptoms simultaneously. SNPs in CRY genes were associated with terminal insomnia alone or in combination with other symptoms. Genes PER1 and two were mostly associated with sleep maintenance insomnia. However, none of the SNPs remained significant after False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple statistical testing. In conclusion, even though none of the SNPs remained significant after FDR correction, the clustering of some genes around specific symptoms points to the need for additional research on these relationships.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Daniela Bragantini"", ids = ""78289975""); list(name = ""BÃ¸rge Sivertsen"", ids = ""144512388""); list(name = ""Philip R Gehrman"", ids = ""4929348""); list(name = ""Stian Lydersen"", ids = ""2128759""); list(name = ""Ismail CÃ¼neyt GÃ¼zey"", ids = ""8101695"")",e02ba58290d8cdc64cc14560baf808051aee4443; 7cf3df299ef0ba8be08879793f4cfea78971f366,,Chronobiology international,36 5,"

17aceacffa08e607491a46f9cede72e6b5d34551,Sample size calculation while controlling false discovery rate for differential expression analysis with RNA-sequencing experiments,"BackgroundRNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments have been popularly applied to transcriptome studies in recent years. Such experiments are still relatively costly. As a result, RNA-seq experiments often employ a small number of replicates. Power analysis and sample size calculation are challenging in the context of differential expression analysis with RNA-seq data. One challenge is that there are no closed-form formulae to calculate power for the popularly applied tests for differential expression analysis. In addition, false discovery rate (FDR), instead of family-wise type I error rate, is controlled for the multiple testing error in RNA-seq data analysis. So far, there are very few proposals on sample size calculation for RNA-seq experiments.ResultsIn this paper, we propose a procedure for sample size calculation while controlling FDR for RNA-seq experimental design. Our procedure is based on the weighted linear model analysis facilitated by the voom method which has been shown to have competitive performance in terms of power and FDR control for RNA-seq differential expression analysis. We derive a method that approximates the average power across the differentially expressed genes, and then calculate the sample size to achieve a desired average power while controlling FDR. Simulation results demonstrate that the actual power of several popularly applied tests for differential expression is achieved and is close to the desired power for RNA-seq data with sample size calculated based on our method.ConclusionsOur proposed method provides an efficient algorithm to calculate sample size while controlling FDR for RNA-seq experimental design. We also provide an R package ssizeRNA that implements our proposed method and can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org).",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ran Bi"", ids = ""5991575""); list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""145779142"")",a4be16a977050b9b06950a973281d7e004b2010c; ffc4b8eb78df46068fe3a8816b6d481acf46f437; ab7bdbde9d47581d802fe00f2dba9f3964b38933; b6c76b0a09199f6fe8a2db02eac27fe96f381fae; e8708e0c35040de914d78d3145dc66eebcff173c; be18434ccd98056f3aedc105c674efa5a60b64ea; ead34dbe8d24c80ca48b9f828aa34be52a65a8a6; fca72870e7a90f2d5586fffb090a0f44abcf9633; f456a6e973e391d39f4985e2d9c741f240253338; c3fcbc619c318daea2cd9b9684040c2a70c39944; e5449d37500e9333dfeb6a7d808b9d3ced86fb66; 4b9cc663d5c62a7a114987e05dd31db10bdea31d; e0f0bcb4e740a53d7b5b89a67d16ace32ec5d95e; 5a7914e8aef02375b3bb8810633f22532aadd992; 014cf4e43d54a3a26884908d0c929a2d5e8c6f54; e53f5a00a6bb9e385a215ac7def3ffed66432240; e42e68854187a2ad208a8c50e8b017fb05402339; 59c3352a17cc5a9524d41cfe60697e294310c59f; 6b329c4f25873d5f43933a54fc09057536a90581; 0d59bd7681dd4897f27e5f85e7445361c5bcef96; b754f4ab5800638df281b0f4d00a95d4a2e189c2; cf7e15d7e6a0654962db80679ccaa3ded878ce89; 237bed656ffd3c4398c443ed2afff57f308ae530; d178b7d68d9b55a21710c27bdb4c1145be3c9e64,e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 701cae7fb41417989c384bcd8268a620c4669ca4; 37e418a07998914db6910f026715ffa0dc2c760d; d220b7869f286ff9e5344afb1572ab00feaeacd7; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; 2f24dbb826f18a9105d87ce62886b57068c7eab5; 8072deb6718a5535045f548ae49ce2a7347a051f; 667f54da16b65cffa1372c320a8c9fec65b828be; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; b0d77b5513db0fec7c2ded884cbcc41605514dfe; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; de377f87f114812ea9fbfa9b1c5e790506f3f08f; bcf2cf850c73f98bfc918f6bfb45b1c9b9681018; 8c955ea6d8b19bee9b5360c956a7a5ed947114fe; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; 1f9c413f9ba5e3aea19880e5918318c1f0051437; 385d419737ab1fee9271c74eaa32460d3c4d0e52; c1ea7e8c8542a305c2f1c771e0320bb9b578eeb4; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532,BMC Bioinformatics,17,
01441afb2028d63f1fac54feb5efcd75771bb6ef,Association of a polymorphism of CYP3A4 with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Although several environmental factors, including a high-calorie diet and physical inactivity, influence the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, genetic factors have been shown to contribute to individual susceptibility to this condition. The purpose of the present study was to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility or resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus, and thereby to contribute to assessment of the genetic risk for this condition. The study population comprised 5259 unrelated Japanese individuals (2980 men, 2279 women), including 1640 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (1071 men, 569 women) and 3619 controls (1909 men, 1710 women). The genotypes for 94 polymorphisms of 67 genes were determined with a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. Evaluation of genotype distributions by the chi-square test revealed that the 13989-->G (Ile118Val) polymorphism of the cytochrome P450, subfamily IIIA, polypeptide 4 gene (CYP3A4) was significantly (false discovery rate, 0.000009) associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex also revealed that the 13989-->G (Ile118Val) polymorphism of CYP3A4 was significantly (P=0.00002) associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the AG genotype being protective against this condition. Genotyping for CYP3A4 may thus prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711""); list(name = ""Hitoshi Matsuo"", ids = ""145470407""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kazuhiro Yajima"", ids = ""144739394""); list(name = ""Takeshi Hibino"", ids = ""4383355""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Sahoko Ichihara"", ids = ""143960626""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189"")",611c313a604835e7a8ea6e4be6003b8526e7a081; be196e9df82b8153f97c955c5d26eed590451602; f46b48dedcbe74137af255ea6c3b33ac49bde9a5; adf347b6413e8aa8ff9922fed582e0c23c802228; 2e067a7d62a4bae4e889390b1ece8514de3fd0fa; ce993040443bdc270452b3b321dcc48606c39f2e; 82d1be5d8cc4bd117e07ebd45b924115e1a02547; dc590d6ff7544f386e8b199b85c3105373940a28; 542ef3cdbdd525984f9dc5418095cdb9b1fef6f6,,International journal of molecular medicine,20 5,"

7702da5c4482c05c916317f6241a9ef8fce4a28b,Sex-Specific Associations between One-Carbon Metabolism Indices and Posttranslational Histone Modifications in Arsenic-Exposed Bangladeshi Adults.,"BACKGROUND
Posttranslational histone modifications (PTHMs) are altered by arsenic, an environmental carcinogen. PTHMs are also influenced by nutritional methyl donors involved in one-carbon metabolism (OCM), which may protect against epigenetic dysregulation.


METHODS
We measured global levels of three PTHMs, which are dysregulated in cancers (H3K36me2, H3K36me3, H3K79me2), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 324 participants enrolled in the Folic Acid and Creatine Trial, a randomized trial in arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi adults. Sex-specific associations between several blood OCM indices (folate, vitamin B12, choline, betaine, homocysteine) and PTHMs were examined at baseline using regression models, adjusted for multiple tests by controlling for the false discovery rate (PFDR). We also evaluated the effects of folic acid supplementation (400 Î¼g/d for 12 weeks), compared with placebo, on PTHMs.


RESULTS
Associations between choline and H3K36me2 and between vitamin B12 and H3K79me2 differed significantly by sex (Pdiff < 0.01 and <0.05, respectively). Among men, plasma choline was positively associated with H3K36me2 (PFDR < 0.05), and among women, plasma vitamin B12 was positively associated with H3K79me2 (PFDR < 0.01). Folic acid supplementation did not alter any of the PTHMs examined (PFDR = 0.80).


CONCLUSIONS
OCM indices may influence PTHMs in a sex-dependent manner, and folic acid supplementation, at this dose and duration, does not alter PTHMs in PBMCs.


IMPACT
This is the first study to examine the influences of OCM indices on PTHMs in a population that may have increased susceptibility to cancer development due to widespread exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water and a high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia.

38fc44d498a165accb43720700efaab8d340074d,Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Pedophilia,"Pedophilia is a principal motivator of child molestation, incurring great emotional and financial burdens on victims and society. Even among pedophiles who never commit any offense, the condition requires lifelong suppression and control. Previous comparison using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of MR images from a large sample of pedophiles and controls revealed group differences in white matter. The present study therefore sought to verify and characterize white matter involvement using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which better captures the microstructure of white matter than does VBM. Pedophilic sex offenders (nÂ =Â 24) were compared with healthy, age-matched controls with no criminal record and no indication of pedophilia (nÂ =Â 32). White matter microstructure was analyzed with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, and the trajectories of implicated fiber bundles were identified by probabilistic tractography. Groups showed significant, highly focused differences in DTI parameters which related to participantsâ€™ genital responses to sexual depictions of children, but not to measures of psychopathy or to childhood histories of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. Some previously reported gray matter differences were suggested under highly liberal statistical conditions (puncorrectedÂ <Â .005), but did not survive ordinary statistical correction (whole brain per voxel false discovery rate of 5Â %). These results confirm that pedophilia is characterized by neuroanatomical differences in white matter microstructure, over and above any neural characteristics attributable to psychopathy and childhood adversity, which show neuroanatomic footprints of their own. Although some gray matter structures were implicated previously, only few have emerged reliably.",2015,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""James M.

8ef0a8c10705c0e7bca5dcababae462a116c6d35,Volumetric and shape analysis of the thalamus in first-episode schizophrenia.,"Thalamic abnormalities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, although the majority of studies used chronic samples treated extensively with antipsychotics. Moreover, the clinical and neuropsychological correlates of these abnormalities remain largely unknown. Using high-resolution MR imaging and novel methods for shape analysis, we investigated thalamic subregions in 35 (25 M/10 F) first-episode schizophrenia patients compared with 33 (23 M/10 F) healthy volunteers. The right and left thalami were traced bilaterally on coronal brain slices and volumes were compared between groups. In addition, regional abnormalities were identified by comparing distances, measured from homologous thalamic surface points to the central core of each individual's surface model, between groups in 3D space. Patients had significantly less total thalamic volume compared with healthy volunteers. Statistical mapping demonstrated most pronounced shape abnormalities in the pulvinar; however, estimated false discovery rates in these regions were sizable. Smaller thalamus volume was significantly correlated with worse overall neuropsychological functioning and specific deficits were observed in the language, motor, and executive domains. There were no significant associations between thalamus volume and positive or negative symptoms. Our findings suggest that thalamic abnormalities are evident at the onset of a first episode of schizophrenia prior to extensive pharmacologic intervention and that these abnormalities have neuropsychological correlates.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Denise M Coscia"", ids = ""1403699357""); list(name = ""Katherine Narr"", ids = ""1924772""); list(name = ""Delbert G Robinson"", ids = ""5339082""); list(name = ""Liberty S.

6bdbb141db2236c9209bd1945ae5a13c40e32e5f,Computational Detection and Functional Analysis of Human Tissue-Specific A-to-I RNA Editing,"A-to-I RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional modification event in vertebrates. It could increase transcriptome and proteome diversity through recoding the genomic information and cross-linking other regulatory events, such as those mediated by alternative splicing, RNAi and microRNA (miRNA). Previous studies indicated that RNA editing can occur in a tissue-specific manner in response to the requirements of the local environment. We set out to systematically detect tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites in 43 human tissues using bioinformatics approaches based on the Fisher's exact test and the Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction. Twenty-three sites in total were identified to be tissue-specific. One of them resulted in an altered amino acid residue which may prevent the phosphorylation of PARP-10 and affect its activity. Eight and two tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites were predicted to destroy putative exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), respectively. Brain-specific and ovary-specific A-to-I RNA editing sites were further verified by comparing the cDNA sequences with their corresponding genomic templates in multiple cell lines from brain, colon, breast, bone marrow, lymph, liver, ovary and kidney tissue. Our findings help to elucidate the role of A-to-I RNA editing in the regulation of tissue-specific development and function, and the approach utilized here can be broadened to study other types of tissue-specific substitution editing.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tao He"", ids = ""144709808""); list(name = ""Qiong Wang"", ids = ""144750114""); list(name = ""Guihai Feng"", ids = ""37707500""); list(name = ""Yaou Hu"", ids = ""2800064""); list(name = ""Li Wang"", ids = ""1703431""); list(name = ""Yumin Wang"", ids = ""47904438"")",31be6075fc43c9952b395b4fe8f0bd4259dc3fcf; 4ab7ef94bb18bec1f1f05fb3855f2c5f5098a2fd; 1cc95d77391891d8e4cb19f0bfe4d6a6d5c0e4f3; b1e182316df49b9bf9fcdf09f7612a87c207f925; 65e73a045b1c2f781c4fb555b2e070334e853fee; fe926f46852325efa4422844bee8cc8dc940e27b; e92adeda7cb86003667c85264f290397e7668d3b; 59369df1931cb3e5ef01da341cf572394b217721; fdcbaa0b821e6204d207a995fbbe9cc913594cda; 2e0040403ecc62f834adc5a4bf20a7b223d927a5,fcb053fb890e13b1da8e5e6bccd88aa40ffe9703; 4c043a4e203ee86deb94f62fe1b5b894c44eb140; 268838ca22f68eab4f39d92d09489da4ae2b44f9; d2b4151811ed9f18013123d417c9732f93b73c49; 6c46750f588ae39434b3b4d19ce3f9abab75fff6; 404ea893bb77bb7b996583afabe334c2de903612; f7aab631623e1e0bcadad17ee7bc5eee2bbcdc78; 159a1157e9ea1644fbcba80fcc968b2adccfc0ba; b8d057735a75269c6a766a31176fa67192c69a66; 466a3a36e0b6d715dcbd99cba364caa6e084a5d8; b410da62f9e50baf3eb13c7297fea427b4c640f6; 940975a5a039096921d021d84203e411b5bc652c; 069bfd5bd59d74eff16b515cff82147cee23d5de; d3137058fe20953bbbbe54142e7339759c358377; 10c0f22670b33a4b1b03bb8bf689fa68680bc8ff; f93ece53f49ba86a5801be0327f168ecf72a6ae4; 118b78f1cb5b1dba24bdcf8c8160a4aeaa522b10; 9ddb30801795817e0670e3aadfd2df9c2485ba9b; faeb9500d7d6f9c91feb71554c8836b4bae58f89; 4e14f1c622002a17d41caadc5d886c4e0b384ebe; b8ec1358ebe773415b32a6a263ca217cb895a5e3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 51f7144eb0d92862cef0c0e015bf049165694989; 1437f50dd74f40215986820a825a27162b33b412; 90fda16b0cfb015452d78545a0376719e43f66fe; 9d901f9077f69cb8121d9ca9470723bcc3ef1652; dcbd94e4abd2ca3ab80812060de846bc897e185b; 50b36c4443bd9ecf63ff5dde7c88b7f47ebe3b51; 5ce7b5057fcd102e232496909c722382403c6e1a; ef90ba0905a352965c65f7227ec4355716077b85; f0ce64c09cf08b9089ed7a8b84bc5fc41e088ddb; bc73c6238cabb5d8b134748c6fc5d0c93f1412e7; bda864c3ea1112428318cc346abb5ea9fd1bed66; c0842b7997fdaf6092bbf6b6486cb64e87002b77; 7f03692c20b39b74dc7a40aca84e6ad85e1576be; e486f1257a73eb3d5cad85f4c800b22452c670ab; cd3feb81b88f200d9f36852c9df9692b59611365; b3da6e18760aa213c699b0be6c323fb301923a67; 25e8b6d94b7da206bc944ba7a3d16d7ebff50ae9; ed98c093430fe67429f2c7b0ea9f126a495fe652; e7a80ada02b7098645d3e4e5cee9e0093d6b29a5; 12c42a900b840846f7061e1eb44e2398b65722e5; 7e6aecb6226022e7471d6262f7ea5ef90b7a53f5; 7b954c14d970fcb62359ac5a7712b6bafd28d072; b331d82beccb9745bb643ed732ffd41ae48d2c59; 1894578b549e4513d4f58f60726a0c1180f35a0c; 1f2ff57f2f999f241a67ffb37f0b2e2d60b1ab2f; e9c4fca4dfde34b90571b3f921af79492934a8f0; d461006da54d0486039dfe00a75195ff6a8dd09b; 193f2218c0a0a5ff3f4dd28176f7106536ff5bd5; 6c9331843a3c4ebdc0bff3219b68f2bec7f5b491,PLoS ONE,6,
2c8b93b2dcebef51d9ec606a73904ea9af1d8649,Extracting binary signals from microarray time-course data,"This article presents a new method for analyzing microarray time courses by identifying genes that undergo abrupt transitions in expression level, and the time at which the transitions occur. The algorithm matches the sequence of expression levels for each gene against temporal patterns having one or two transitions between two expression levels. The algorithm reports a P-value for the matching pattern of each gene, and a global false discovery rate can also be computed. After matching, genes can be sorted by the direction and time of transitions. Genes can be partitioned into sets based on the direction and time of change for further analysis, such as comparison with Gene Ontology annotations or binding site motifs. The method is evaluated on simulated and actual time-course data.

ab1b7a37582c5cd6d2d232421e0cce44c5eaa9bd,Changes in Cesarean section scar dimensions during pregnancy: a prospective longitudinal study.,"OBJECTIVES
To describe changes in Cesarean section (CS) scars longitudinally throughout pregnancy, and to relate initial scar measurements, demographic variables and obstetric variables to subsequent changes in scar features and to final pregnancy outcome.


METHODS
In this prospective observational study we used transvaginal sonography (TVS) to examine the CS scar of 320 consecutive pregnant women at 11-13, 19-21 and 32-34â€‰weeks' gestation. For scars visible on TVS, the hypoechoic part was measured in three dimensions and the residual myometrial thickness (RMT) was also measured. Analyses were carried out using one-way repeated measures ANOVA and mixed modeling. The incidence of subsequent scar rupture was recorded.


RESULTS
The CS scar was visible in 284/320 cases (89%). Concerning length and depth of the hypoechoic part of the scar and RMT, the larger the initial scar measurement, the larger the decrease observed during pregnancy. For the hypoechoic part of the scar, the width increased on average by 1.8â€‰mm per trimester, while the depth and length decreased by 1.8 and 1.9â€‰mm, respectively (false discovery rate Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Mean RMT in the first trimester was 5.2â€‰mm and on average decreased by 1.1â€‰mm per trimester. Two cases (0.62%) of uterine scar rupture were confirmed following a trial of vaginal delivery; these had a mean RMT of 0.5â€‰mm at second scan and an average decrease of 2.6â€‰mm over the course of pregnancy.


CONCLUSION
This study establishes reference data and confirms that the dimensions of CS scars change throughout pregnancy. Scar rupture was associated with a smaller RMT and greater decrease in RMT during pregnancy. There is the potential to test absolute values and observed changes in CS scar measurements as predictors of uterine scar rupture and outcome in trials of vaginal birth after Cesarean section.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Omar P.

deb3e0b8ba812e3f48d89ee9e44048a38510b2b4,649: Influenza Viral Infection and Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Patients,"Critical Care Medicine â€¢ Volume 46 â€¢ Number 1 (Supplement) www.ccmjournal.org Learning Objectives: Anecdotal reports suggest risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is higher among critically ill patients with influenza, especially those with the 2009 H1N1 Influenza A virus, compared with those who have other respiratory viruses. This has yet to be confirmed. Methods: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study, including critically ill patients with a positive respiratory virus test spending â‰¥ 24 hours in an ICU between November 2007 and August 2016. The primary analysis compared in-hospital VTE rates between patients with and without influenza, while the secondary analysis compared the same between patients with and without confirmed 2009 H1N1 Influenza A. Patients were excluded if they received therapeutic anticoagulation within 48 hours of admission, had surgery or trauma within 7 days prior to or following admission, diagnosed thrombophilia, or both influenza and other respiratory viruses. Interquartile intervals (IQI) were reported along with medians. Odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using a Wald normal approximation, along with Chi-square test pvalues. The false discovery rate (FDR) of the secondary analysis was limited at â‰¤ 5% per the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results: Of the 1300 patients with respiratory viruses, 387 (30%) had influenza, 123 of which were H1N1. Median age was 58 years (44â€“69), median APACHE II score was 19 (14â€“26), and 64% (n = 832) of patients were mechanically ventilated. In-hospital VTE occurred in 7.5% of patients with influenza and in 8.4% with other respiratory viruses (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 1.4, P = 0.571), and in 12% and 7.7% in respiratory viral patients with and without H1N1, respectively (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.93 to 3.0, FDR-adjusted P = 0.170). Conclusions: VTE incidence was not significantly different between critically ill respiratory viral patients with and without influenza. Although the estimated in-hospital VTE incidence was higher among critically ill respiratory viral patients with H1N1, the difference was not statistically significant.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruixin Shi"", ids = ""66947025""); list(name = ""Stephanie Chauv"", ids = ""7489626""); list(name = ""Peter F.

84a6b4bab7c12b7c10ce32c43d8fc0d461e8e105,Characterization of snoRNA Expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are small (90-300nt) non-coding guide RNAs found in all multicellular organisms. H/ACA and CD box snoRNAs localize to the nucleolar region and are part of a catalytic multicomponent protein complex selecting target RNAs based on complementarity. They are responsible for the site-specific pseudouridylation and 29 O methylation of ribosomal RNAs, respectively. ScaRNAs localize to the Cajal body and are responsible for the methylation and pseudouridylation of splicesomal RNAs U1, U2, U4, U5, and U12. There are also orphan snoRNAs without any known RNA targets. Recent studies have suggested an expanded role for snoRNAs outside of ribosomal biogenesis, including the regulation of RNA splicing and chromatin remodeling. Moreover, emerging data suggest that aberrantly expressed snoRNAs may contribute to neoplastic transformation. Here, we characterize snoRNA expression in normal human hematopoiesis and in AML. We first developed a novel strategy to identify and quantify properly processed snoRNAs. This is important, since standard RNA sequencing or array-based analyses cannot distinguish between processed snoRNAs and primary mRNA transcripts of the host genes (most snoRNAs are contained in the introns of coding genes). In brief, we take advantage of the fact that, like miRNAs, snoRNAs contain a free 39-hydroxyl group, which allows for efficient ligation to sequencing adaptors. Following size selection (20-200 nt) to enrich for small non-coding RNAs, the libraries are sequenced on the Illumina next generation sequencing platform. We also have developed a novel analysis pipeline that maps areas of contiguous alignment in the genome, forming ab initio ""clusters"" representing snoRNAs. Using this sequencing assay, we first interrogated snoRNA expression in hematopoietic cells from healthy individuals. Specifically, we sequenced small RNA libraries derived from CD34 + cells, promyelocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, T-cells, and B-cells. Of the 269 known snoRNAs, 132 (49%) were expressed in one or more hematopoietic cell population. Likewise, 80 of 112 (71%) of known H/ACA box snoRNAs, and all 21 scaRNAs were expressed. In addition, we identified (and computationally validated using SnoReport, snoGPS, and an in-house snoFinder script) 8 putative novel snoRNAs (1 H/ACA box and 7 CD box snoRNAs). Most snoRNAs were stably expressed across all hematopoietic lineages. However, there were numerous examples of snoRNAs that were specifically enriched in a specific hematopoietic cell population (e.g., CD34 + cells). We also identified several snoRNAs that were up- or down-regulated during granulocytic differentiation. For example, many of the orphan C/D box snoRNAs contained in the imprinted DLK/DIO3 locus on chromosome 14q32 are significantly down-regulated during granulocytic differentiation. To determine whether snoRNAs are frequently dysregulated in AML, we next sequenced small non-coding RNAs isolated from the bone marrow of 33 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (all with a normal karyotype). Using a strict 5% false discovery rate, only 9.3% of CD box snoRNAs and 0.9% of H/ACA box snoRNAs were found to have significantly increased or decreased expression compared with normal CD34+ cells (including some of the putative novel snoRNAs). Of note, no differentially expressed snoRNAs were detected comparing AML with or without DNMT3A mutations or with or without IDH1/2 mutations. We next interrogated published whole genome sequencing data to determine whether there were any cytogenetically silent genetic alterations in snoRNAs. No recurring point mutations or small insertions/deletions were detected in snoRNA genes in 50 cases of AML. In summary, we developed a new next-generation sequencing approach and analysis pipeline to quantify snoRNAs. We show that, compared with coding genes, snoRNA expression is more stable across different hematopoietic lineages, consistent with a housekeeping function. However, examples of developmentally-regulated and lineage-restricted snoRNA expression were identified. Finally, we show that a small subset of snoRNAs appear to be dysregulated in AML, although genetic alterations the specifically target snoRNAs appear to be rare in AML.

Fatty acids (FAs) are important for reproductive processes, including steroidogenesis, though associations with fecundability, as measured by time to pregnancy (TTP), are unclear.


Objective
To investigate the relationship between preconception plasma phospholipid FA (PPFA) levels and time to human chorionic gonadotropin-pregnancy among women with prior pregnancy loss.


Design, Setting, and Participants
Prospective cohort of 1228 women attempting pregnancy (aged 18 to 40 years, with one or two prior pregnancy losses) followed for up to six cycles at four US university medical centers during 2006 to 2012. PPFA levels were measured at baseline.


Main Outcome Measures
Associations with fecundability overall and by body mass index (BMI) group after adjusting for confounders were estimated using fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% CIs. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons.


Results
Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were associated with increased fecundability or shorter TTP [FOR, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.16) per unit increase in percentage of total FAs], whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were associated with decreased fecundability or longer TTP [FOR, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.00) per 1% change], though associations only remained significant after FDR adjustment among women with BMI <25 kg/m2. Saturated FA and trans FA were not associated with fecundability. Omega-3 FAs and omega-6 linoleic acid were not associated with fecundability.


Conclusion
We observed associations between preconception MUFA and PUFA levels and fecundability among women with normal BMI, highlighting the importance of FA composition among normal-weight women with prior pregnancy loss.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunni L.

After informed consent, male volunteers were prospectively categorized into 3 groups upon European Society of Hypertension criteria based on 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements: (1) hypertension, (2) borderline hypertension, and (3) normotension. Stool, urine and serum samples were collected in fasting conditions. Gut microbiota was characterized by 16S amplicon sequencing. Metabolomics, including quantification of short-chain fatty acids, was conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance. Two-way ANOVA combined with Tukey post hoc test, as well as multiple permutation test and Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli false discovery rate procedure, was used. The cohort included 54 males: 38 hypertensive (including 21 under treatment), 7 borderline, and 9 normotensive. No significant difference was observed between groups concerning age, body mass index, smoking habits, and weekly alcohol consumption. The genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1 positively correlated with BP levels in nontreated patients (n=33). This correlation was significant after multiple permutation tests but was not substantiated following false discovery rate adjustment. Short-chain fatty acid levels were significantly different among groups, with higher stool levels of acetate, butyrate, and propionate in hypertensive versus normotensive individuals. No difference was observed in serum and urine metabolomes. Correlation between stool metabolome and 24-hour BP levels was evidenced, with R2 reaching 0.9. Our pilot study based on 24-hour ambulatory BP measurements, 16S amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics supports an association between gut microbiota and BP homeostasis, with changes in stool abundance of short-chain fatty acids.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Justine Huart"", ids = ""81354778""); list(name = ""Justine Leenders"", ids = ""39969634""); list(name = ""Bernard Taminiau"", ids = ""4919651""); list(name = ""Julie Descy"", ids = ""4412188""); list(name = ""Annie Saint-Remy"", ids = ""1429237811""); list(name = ""Georges Daube"", ids = ""89562166""); list(name = ""Jean-Marie Krzesinski"", ids = ""4938543""); list(name = ""Pierrette Melin"", ids = ""50082427""); list(name = ""Pascal de Tullio"", ids = ""123562044""); list(name = ""FranÃ§ois Jouret"", ids = ""4616571"")",1bbd40a235461095f6df08b399dd80bfb5ac2629; 9edd534fd16cdd0963f2ecf9e79fe6880235216a; 830a32f85a3f42be82ef392b1709f7fee550936a,,Hypertension,,"

292f3c934367b1918b759cd1be661c2ef4bf5c39,Phenome-Wide Association Studies Uncover a Novel Association of Increased Atrial Fibrillation in Male Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"OBJECTIVE
Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) scan across billing codes in the electronic health record (EHR) and re-purpose clinical EHR data for research. In this study, we examined whether PheWAS could function as an EHR-based discovery tool for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and identified novel clinical associations in male versus female patients with SLE.


METHODS
We used a de-identified version of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center EHR, which includes more than 2.8 million subjects. We performed EHR-based PheWAS to compare SLE patients with age-, sex-, and race-matched control subjects and to compare male SLE patients with female SLE patients, controlling for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) P value of 0.05.


RESULTS
We identified 1,097 patients with SLE and 5,735 matched control subjects. In a comparison of patients with SLE and matched controls, SLE patients were shown to be more likely to have International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes related to the SLE disease criteria. In the PheWAS of male versus female SLE patients, with adjustment for age and race, male patients were shown to be more likely to have atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 4.50, false discovery rate P = 3.23 Ã— 10-3 ). Chart review confirmed atrial fibrillation, with the majority of patients developing atrial fibrillation after the SLE diagnosis and having multiple risk factors for atrial fibrillation. After adjustment for age, sex, race, and coronary artery disease, SLE disease status was shown to be significantly associated with atrial fibrillation (P = 0.002).


CONCLUSION
Using PheWAS to compare male and female patients with SLE, we identified a novel association of an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in male patients. SLE disease status was shown to be independently associated with atrial fibrillation, even after adjustment for age, sex, race, and coronary artery disease. These results demonstrate the utility of PheWAS as an EHR-based discovery tool for SLE.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""April Barnado"", ids = ""6339688""); list(name = ""Robert J.

e96c42f05643aaf71e6b5c76357ec560f7a8fafb,Using Alpha Wisely: Improving Power to Detect Multiple QTL,"The increase in the number of available markers for many experimental populations has led to QTL studies with ever increasing marker numbers and densities. The resulting conundrum is that as marker density increases, so does the multiple testing problem. It is important to re-examine the detection of multiple QTL in light of increasing marker density. We explore through simulation whether existing methods have achieved the maximum possible power for detecting multiple QTL and whether increasing the marker density is an effective strategy for locating multiple QTL. In addition to existing methods, such as the maximum, the CET, and the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli procedures, we propose and evaluate the complete set of order statistics with their corresponding empirical joint distribution. We examine these statistics in conjunction with a novel application of the alpha-spending approach, providing a less conservative solution to the problem of controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple tests. We conducted a simulation study to assess the relative power of these approaches as well as their ability to control FDR. We find that several of the new approaches have a reasonable FDR, and can substantially improve the experimenter's ability to detect multiple QTL compared to existing approaches in many cases; however, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure remains a very reasonable choice. The methods are applied to a nine-trait Oat vernalization dataset.",2004,Medicine,"list(name = ""Katy L. Simonsen"", ids = ""3921261""); list(name = ""Lauren M.

Graphical abstract Figure. No caption available. ABSTRACT The identification of connexelâ€wise associations, which involves examining functional connectivities between pairwise voxels across the whole brain, is both statistically and computationally challenging. Although such a connexelâ€wise methodology has recently been adopted by brainâ€wide association studies (BWAS) to identify connectivity changes in several mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism and depression, the multiple correction and power analysis methods designed specifically for connexelâ€wise analysis are still lacking. Therefore, we herein report the development of a rigorous statistical framework for connexelâ€wise significance testing based on the Gaussian random field theory. It includes controlling the familyâ€wise error rate (FWER) of multiple hypothesis testings using topological inference methods, and calculating power and sample size for a connexelâ€wise study. Our theoretical framework can control the falseâ€positive rate accurately, as validated empirically using two restingâ€state fMRI datasets. Compared with Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR), it can reduce falseâ€positive rate and increase statistical power by appropriately utilizing the spatial information of fMRI data. Importantly, our method bypasses the need of nonâ€parametric permutation to correct for multiple comparison, thus, it can efficiently tackle large datasets with high resolution fMRI images. The utility of our method is shown in a caseâ€control study. Our approach can identify altered functional connectivities in a major depression disorder dataset, whereas existing methods fail.

974bb3bc08d78c98700f2fe17dd36208f88599e9,G9A performs important roles in the progression of breast cancer through upregulating its targets,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of malignancy in females worldwide, however, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms behind the development and progression of BC and identify potential biomarkers for it. The chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) dataset GSM1642516 and gene expression dataset GSE34925 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Affy and oligo packages were used for the background correction and normalization of the gene expression dataset. Based on Limma package and the criteria of a fold change >1.41 or <0.71, and a false discovery rate adjusted P-value <0.05, differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (G9A) -knockout (KO) breast samples compared with control samples were identified. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis was used for the functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Bowtie 2 and model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq version 14 (macs14) were used for the mapping of raw reads and the identification of G9A binding sites (peaks), respectively. In addition, overlapping genes between the DEGs and genes in the peaks located in -3000 to 3000 bp centered in the transcription start sites (conpeaks) were screened out and microRNAs (miRNAs) believed to regulate those overlaps were identified through the TargetScan database. A total of 217 DEGs were identified in G9A-KO samples, which were mainly involved in the biological processes and pathways associated with the inflammatory response and cancer progression. A total of 10,422 peaks, containing 1,210 conpeaks involving 1,138 genes, were identified. Among the 1,138 genes, 15 were overlapped with the DEGs, and 35 miRNAs were identified to regulate those overlaps. Insulin-induced gene 1 was regulated by 9 genes in the miRNA-gene regulation network, which may indicate its importance in the progression of BC. The present study identified potential biomarkers of BC that may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the disease.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wenhua Jiang"", ids = ""47897312""); list(name = ""Pengfei Liu"", ids = ""50500463""); list(name = ""Xiaodong Li"", ids = ""50080269"")",113fec361ece1c43293a6767aaefcab5ff472c55,4230683958326852227ff75dc13f4398a01ecc4d; 0332b4cd68d337625ecb820f66d9f3155fddcdec; a0981aa771c866347e6af83a817651e206b7c89a; a610249aa397f2606e937438470ff5e804552af4; 9eb39da1d60b829253e04fe05436e06ce89dc450; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; cf58cad8791396dbca84993d5509ab3f4bdce943; 74dab891a0032a5dca2c66851084923f2f2a5f4c; 2173a7ed9dacaa8bb6085305f4da14b6ba4a8c80; a1e88af10294997595450c7340dbd2e05d6128b1; 964979d0fc8374a2e3f0022d80079efcabb468e6; a9a53774e07dfedccd126c74833d4d98f17ee560; 6b6ecece9386ffded71d584866410531689082b6; 2fc54574a07dfd34fb74808fc2009aab0c85684e; 45b29450177a3a84023adf5e82ecc9f587695502; 132bcbe62f929878fc9ba653aa8a2ddb3a4891f3; 25e97fce6a94c8f7eb828b6c5f07b408ed61753b; d5169e8dd745bed694ab706c3002f7c7885281b0; 0777ff1894ba1f0ca1e497b8365dbc1494887ce6; 924f7888fae1e94234fae22ce7fa3a670fae5c70; 019cc66150ebaaa175bc8c0ca96281429e389a1b; ec913fb7a97965c36a8b40b8fc306214d8265707; ec0b1f3e9bb9ccb220fed4f70c881c59a8df5c07; 3297496c05bfc3bd0b8dafdd016f66c028c00d4f; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 7f5ea4dc5a4bce193785609ee7bc1c9dd0530f4d; 9ce6eaf698aefeb2a5ab3205637da077c813c134; e4a05c6d9781081b6a9e9949bd836f33d73a1dea; 837f8c33d102659fbbfbaed682d86699d5d9da96; a760eaac52e9bc189076668c47d1c4d8cd9869e1; 9b8cc6e478775075210718485c256b08ac975d79; 76b44677d236d51f079a8885231d15bc256b0662; 03dea384478f94f8bae578088d62432ed38aac72; e941ae2e92ecc9dcc2acd3899731698b531520ff; 55e9e3b93c11a4de40a7da8328358cf1e6101e3c; c23dd78c56d3173738facac85b8a0caf00fff860; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; e4b3a4ee1a04c5a62b3d74fdae46dc6f984c70b9; 992a269f3f619ae6921779c607d2bde780c15ee8,Oncology Letters,13,4127 - 4132
d0fde1bb8a0526541157ca03ed0446fe9a66c54a,Pipeliner: software to evaluate the performance of bioinformatics pipelines for next-generation resequencing.,"The choice of technology and bioinformatics approach is critical in obtaining accurate and reliable information from next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments. An increasing number of software and methodological guidelines are being published, but deciding upon which approach and experimental design to use can depend on the particularities of the species and on the aims of the study. This leaves researchers unable to produce informed decisions on these central questions. To address these issues, we developed pipeliner - a tool to evaluate, by simulation, the performance of NGS pipelines in resequencing studies. Pipeliner provides a graphical interface allowing the users to write and test their own bioinformatics pipelines with publicly available or custom software. It computes a number of statistics summarizing the performance in SNP calling, including the recovery, sensitivity and false discovery rate for heterozygous and homozygous SNP genotypes. Pipeliner can be used to answer many practical questions, for example, for a limited amount of NGS effort, how many more reliable SNPs can be detected by doubling coverage and halving sample size or what is the false discovery rate provided by different SNP calling algorithms and options. Pipeliner thus allows researchers to carefully plan their study's sampling design and compare the suitability of alternative bioinformatics approaches for their specific study systems.

e6eea800a0147a3861048a157f7cc63de4905b46,Association of germ-line genetic variation in the NK3 homeobox 1 gene with overall survival in advanced-stage castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).,"75 Background: We investigated the association of germline variation in ten candidate genes important in prostate cancer biology (NKX3-1, JAK2, SLCO2B1, STAT3, CYP19A1, HSD17B4, TRMT11, PRMT3, HSD17B12, NCOA4) with overall survival (OS) in a cohort of metastatic CRPC stage patients.


METHODS
Patients (N=497) were enrolled at the time of androgen deprivation therapy failure for D2 stage prostate cancer. Candidate genes were selected from the literature and pilot studies. Genes were tagged using SNPs from HapMap with minor allele frequency (MAF) of >5% and r2â‰¥0.8. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and genotyped using Illumina Veracode platform. The primary endpoint was OS, defined as time from development of CRPC to death. Principle components analysis was used for gene-levels tests. To account for multiple testing we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR). For SNP level results we estimated per allele (ordinal model) hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox regression and adjusted for age and Gleason score (GS).


RESULTS
We successfully genotyped 60 SNPs (from 10 genes) in 497 Caucasian subjects. The median age of the CRPC cohort was 71 years (range 43,93). The GS distribution was 51% subjects with GSâ‰¥8; 32% with GS7 and 17% with GS<7. After a median follow up of 2.1 years (IQ range: 1.2-3.6), 297 subjects had died. In unadjusted gene level analyses, NKX3-1 (p=0.04; FDR=0.03) was associated with OS. After adjusting for age and GS the result remained significant (p=0.03). Two of the 5 genotyped SNPs in this gene were associated with OS after adjustment for age and GS: rs10503733 (dominant model p=0.03, HR=0.77; 95 CI=0.60-0.98; A>C; MAF = 0.22) and rs7005368 (dominant model p=0.05, HR=1.38, 95CI=1.0-1.92; G>A; MAF=0.07). Both SNPs are in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium and in complete LD (D'=1), although r2 is low (r2=0.025) due to different allele frequencies.


CONCLUSIONS
Variation in the homeobox NKX-1 gene, a prostate specific tumor suppressor gene involved in prostate development and carcinogenesis is significantly associated with OS in CRPC after accounting for age and GS. Further validation is needed to develop these as prognostic biomarkers.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shannon K. McDonnell"", ids = ""4995984""); list(name = ""Graham H.

However, IBD pathogenesis involves both immunological and vascular abnormalities. Using the first murine model of AA (developed by us), we aimed to determine the role of AA in modulating vascular remodelling mediated by endothelin activity in IBD.MethodsMice with two laparotomies each served as controls (sham-sham or SS). Distal colons were harvested (four AA group colons, four SS group colons), and RNA extracted from each. The RNA was subjected to microarray analysis and RT-PCR validation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to further analyze the microarray data.ResultsGene expression of seven genes closely associated with endothelin activity was examined in distal colons 3Â days post-AA and 28Â days post-AA. While there were no gene expression changes 3Â days post-AA, the genes EDN1 (0.7-fold), EDN2 (0.8-fold) and ECE2 (0.8-fold) were downregulated (*p value <0.05) 28Â days post-AA. However, EDN3 (1.3-fold) was upregulated 28Â days post-AA (*p value <0.05). GSEA analysis showed downregulation of 11 gene sets (stringent cut-offsâ€”false discovery rate <5Â % and p value <0.001) associated with endothelin and endothelin-converting enzyme genes by AA, in contrast to only 1 being upregulated.ConclusionsAA induces a delayed but significant suppression of genes pertaining to endothelin activity.

5ae9533111102646f530a5a909033f204c15825a,Longitudinal Changes in Resting-State Brain Activity in a Capsular Infarct Model,"Strokes attributable to subcortical infarcts have been increasing recently in elderly patients. To gain insight how this lesion influences the motor outcome and responds to rehabilitative training, we used circumscribed photothrombotic capsular infarct models on 36 Sprague-Dawley rats (24 experimental and 12 sham-operated). We used 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose-micro positron emission tomography (FDG-microPET) to assess longitudinal changes in resting-state brain activity (rs-BA) and daily single-pellet reaching task (SPRT) trainings to evaluate motor recovery. Longitudinal FDG-microPET results showed that capsular infarct resulted in a persistent decrease in rs-BA in bilateral sensory and auditory cortices, and ipsilesional motor cortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus (P<0.0025, false discovery rate (FDR) q<0.05). The decreased rs-BA is compatible with diaschisis and contributes to manifest the malfunctions of lesion-specific functional connectivity. In contrast, capsular infarct resulted in increase of rs-BA in the ipsilesional internal capsule, and contralesional red nucleus and ventral hippocampus in recovery group (P<0.0025, FDR q<0.05), implying that remaining subcortical structures have an important role in conducting the recovery process in capsular infarct. The SPRT training facilitated motor recovery only in rats with an incomplete destruction of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) (Pearson's correlation, P<0.05). Alternative therapeutic interventions are required to enhance the potential for recovery in capsular infarct with complete destruction of PLIC.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Donghyeon Kim"", ids = ""7184019""); list(name = ""Ra Gyung Kim"", ids = ""5652259""); list(name = ""Hyung-Sun Kim"", ids = ""1775845""); list(name = ""Jin-Myung Kim"", ids = ""7950648""); list(name = ""Sung Chan Jun"", ids = ""2158922""); list(name = ""Boreom Lee"", ids = ""3069730""); list(name = ""Hang Joon Jo"", ids = ""34183711""); list(name = ""Pedro Rosa Neto"", ids = ""46789626""); list(name = ""Minju Lee"", ids = ""40693217""); list(name = ""Hyoung-Ihl Kim"", ids = ""2244433"")",0c8947fd50f301185817d6152aaa8f80142a1801; 1f0c7ef580560f8f9d6f58b388e2fe3663e7768e; 4f5bf89555ab42833d77481355047316ff579aa6; 12f7761d36aede96bfe26156396ce76b344cff3a; f4a4261e6a38f50bc8161a91b6787a76e86c3d3e; 1c90d86350393e4e4cc4a78f20cb66eac7b9566c; 8c63068e49d8fa33527607abf7079b3ff997eaca; 0a8de318e9c88760c17425ad4ea5e88948e6a96f,0d8e01dbd5f348c0808e884a31fa9ebc9fd44aee; 41cc1be7d08a9dbb0f5df6124a872a2a3d525eae; 312e796b25b647d1daef02eb2befd5095aebbce1; 65dc1dda629b449d5b60aaf5e1d9f0990d553a61; d1a33dd187e505484346ec527a3181080a81fb4a; 09c6a170eddb3b0a2cb25fcc957cfdd7fbbda6cf; 25d15e67384278c6a787971c9038cf30a661160b; e65f480b26291ade9f3c6df9f2615558ef734805; c8492491abc365db58adf59aa5f5726d5c4ff0c6; 223f424f6743caeb8b40eb849f217dbe299f7d6e; 57770cdf53557c7672222cb9baf955193d22df16; bf507ecaadb8ad3ffd849aecaf369a0072d60a5a; 1cbfcf5e53b4b6b79aec935484c5bdfb2bfda7de; 599911fb0615f66330a27c7ad51fe4377969fedb; e895f8573341aef7ef52019f675d9f80c4b581da; 22f9267d2de45f4b26c94312f4eb8d47f273c6c4; a9332a9a3ae0e768458505c73c4ea55c8f89e0a0; 7e8f728c62b49afeb5b4b17c94d9991c671a1d36; f33fb20b790a05282b9e634d2f0ee9e233d5bdaa; 29912145e4bd750204b08037c2e57ce55a546201; d1004dbf2df83e072b6eb7f4eb94cce390ea0a4e; 78fae77c100a0442b78bf34622fa24a65f2dc3ea; 0f9e4850416e1c23bd8f7ef552ae8223e5cc7cff; 347d8e55ef632c972f27aac096563d2774faa246; 0d12376e712c02afcee59d665650c61be9036854; b23af3a6325637231162cbb8dfd17b0ba1368c28; fdca4c7f00ce39a85993e5d4c9ed8b83a85e0fa2; 3c30f74e3642028ddbaffd1ff34993cc4cf33bf7; 3a1a31acfb65a08b668a1967a701bb6709dde10b; 9adf78008992846bcdc80cb58d7ef948ed7ba6d1; 70f65725db2f58bfd411df6e1c0bd9a2f0e8e9b1; 4b6893928b3447258308a9c957c6c8a6c2b4ae1d; 182ff4413a2ce4ced943613b4e2c3973ac5bc1c9; 0cf72709652fb0ac0568147505ddb6215952f67a; 679fa9ead352907b5b94f2fba628406f89709131; 5fd262981475aae71969ca0f9916ace11b6aae70; 94a4780ad1a08a48261500ad1e6c1ad71584ee9a; 90024c676eae11d92b2ddac80ed6e86f18b5c675; 96a953b1b7cf3b0af424e3ffe528640bc954ca9b,Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism,35,11 - 19

16bfeed0b0572b62ffcd0be730ed75da84e1690c,Abstract 4970: Oxidative phosphorylation as a target in triple negative breast cancer therapy,"Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. It is increasingly recognized that selected tumors are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, the role of OXPHOS in TNBC is not well understood. We performed RNA sequencing in pre-treatment biopsies from 43 patients with operable triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who received sequential taxane- and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 63 months, 14 patients recurred and 12 patients died. At a false discovery rate of 0.05, 33 genes were differentially expressed between the patients who did and did not have a subsequent recurrence. Ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated that one of the top canonical pathways that differed was higher expression of oxidative phosphorylation signature (p=5.89E-0.7). The patients who recurred had significantly higher levels of mitochondrial genes: MT-ND1 (adjusted p or FDR-BH; q=0.007); MT-ND5 (q=0.03) and MT-ND4 (q=0.04). Further, 21 genes were differentially expressed between patients based on survival, including MT-ND5 (q=0.001); MT-ND4 (q=0.005), MT-ND4L (q=0.015), MT-ND6 (q=0.018), and MT-ATP6 (P=0.03). Top canonical pathway that was differentially expressed based on survival was oxidative phosphorylation (p=9.98E-10). We therefore sought to determine the efficacy of IACS-10759, a novel inhibitor of OXPHOS, in 10 different TNBC patient-derived xenografts representing different gene expression based Lehmann TNBC subtypes. Growth inhibition was observed in multiple subtypes, with regression in one basal-like 1(BL1) 1 model, and stabilization of growth in multiple BL1 and immunomodulatory expression subtypes. Taken together, our data suggests that high OXPHOS is associated with higher recurrence and lower survival. OXPHOS is a promising target in several TNBC subtypes. A Phase I trial of IACS-10759, a potent inhibitor of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation, in leukemia is ongoing and planned in TNBC and other solid tumors.

a91df562dd2919ef9390b9567968f5aa687f95c1,Transcriptional profiling of mammary gland in Holstein cows with extremely different milk protein and fat percentage using RNA sequencing,"BackgroundRecently, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly emerged as a major transcriptome profiling system. Elucidation of the bovine mammary gland transcriptome by RNA-seq is essential for identifying candidate genes that contribute to milk composition traits in dairy cattle.ResultsWe used massive, parallel, high-throughput, RNA-seq to generate the bovine transcriptome from the mammary glands of four lactating Holstein cows with extremely high and low phenotypic values of milk protein and fat percentage. In total, we obtained 48,967,376â€“75,572,578 uniquely mapped reads that covered 82.25% of the current annotated transcripts, which represented 15549 mRNA transcripts, across all the four mammary gland samples. Among them, 31 differentially expressed genes (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, false discovery rate qâ€‰<â€‰0.05) between the high and low groups of cows were revealed. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated that the 31 differently expressed genes were enriched in specific biological processes with regard to protein metabolism, fat metabolism, and mammary gland development (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Integrated analysis of differential gene expression, previously reported quantitative trait loci, and genome-wide association studies indicated that TRIB3, SAA (SAA1, SAA3, and M-SAA3.2), VEGFA, PTHLH, and RPL23A were the most promising candidate genes affecting milk protein and fat percentage.ConclusionsThis study investigated the complexity of the mammary gland transcriptome in dairy cattle using RNA-seq.

Several protein markers measured in blood have been found to be associated with PrCa risk. However, most previous studies assessed only a small number of biomarkers or included a small sample size. To search for novel protein biomarkers for PrCa risk, we performed a large study in 79,194 prostate cancer cases and 61,112 controls of European ancestry included in PRACTICAL/ELLIPSE consortia by using genetic instruments. Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) for 1,478 plasma proteins identified in a large study of 3,301 European descendants were used as instruments to evaluate associations between genetically predicted protein levels and PrCa risk. For proteins showing a significant association with PrCa risk, we further evaluated whether genetically predicted mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes were associated with PrCa risk, by using mRNA expression prediction models for blood, prostate and cross tissue built using data of the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project. We identified 31 proteins showing an association of their predicted levels with PrCa risk at a false discovery rate Our study has identified multiple proteins significantly associated with PrCa risk. Further research is needed to evaluate potential utility of the identified proteins in early detection of PrCa.

0e881d768bc73b9a30da10a6aeac06287a2d6d7e,Gut Microbiota and a Selectively Bred Taste Phenotype: A Novel Model of Microbiome-Behavior Relationships.,"OBJECTIVES
The microbiota-gut-brain axis is increasingly implicated in obesity, anxiety, stress, and other health-related processes. Researchers have proposed that gut microbiota may influence dietary habits, and pathways through the microbiota-gut-brain axis make such a relationship feasible; however, few data bear on the hypothesis. As a first step in the development of a model system, the gut microbiome was examined in rat lines selectively outbred on a taste phenotype with biobehavioral profiles that have diverged with respect to energy regulation, anxiety, and stress.


METHODS
Occidental low and high-saccharin-consuming rats were assessed for body mass and chow, water, and saccharin intake; littermate controls had shared cages with rats in the experimental group but were not assessed. Cecum and colon microbial communities were profiled using Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing and multivariate analysis of microbial diversity and composition.


RESULTS
The saccharin phenotype was confirmed (low-saccharin-consuming rats, 0.7Î”% [0.9Î”%]; high-saccharin-consuming rats, 28.1Î”% [3.6Î”%]). Regardless of saccharin exposure, gut microbiota differed between lines in terms of overall community similarity and taxa at lower phylogenetic levels. Specifically, 16 genera in three phyla distinguished the lines at a 10% false discovery rate.


DISCUSSION
The study demonstrates for the first time that rodent lines created through selective pressure on taste and differing on functionally related correlates host different microbial communities. Whether the microbiota are causally related to the taste phenotype or its correlates remains to be determined.

This association may be modified by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isoenzymes ADH1B and ADH1C. The Netherlands Cohort Study comprises 62 573 women, aged 55-69 years at baseline (1986). Follow-up for postmenopausal BC for 20.3 years was available. Genotyping of six tag SNPs in ADH1B and ADH1C was performed on DNA from toenails. A case-cohort approach was used for analysis (complete data available for nsubcohort = 1301; ncases = 1630). Cox regression models for postmenopausal BC were applied to determine marginal effects of alcohol intake and SNPs using a dominant genetic model, as well as multiplicative interaction of the two. Results were also obtained for subtypes by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Multiple testing was adjusted for by applying the false discovery rate (FDR). Alcohol intake (categorical) increased the risk of postmenopausal BC (Ptrend = 0.031). Trends for ER and PR subgroups followed a similar pattern. Continuous modeling of alcohol resulted in a hazard rate ratio (HR) for overall postmenopausal BC of 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.19) per 10 g/day of alcohol. SNPs were not associated with BC risk. No effect modification of the alcohol-BC association by SNP genotype was seen after FDR correction in overall BC and ER/PR subgroups. In conclusion, alcohol consumption was shown to increase the risk of postmenopausal BC. This association was not significantly modified by common SNPs in ADH1B and ADH1C, neither in overall BC nor in hormone receptor-defined subtypes.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Markus Hahn"", ids = ""48196293""); list(name = ""Colinda C J M Simons"", ids = ""5640659""); list(name = ""Matty P.

0662804f28c3a09c11fb0c0d0158202d45e2be3a,A Unified Computational Framework to Compare Direct and Sequential False Discovery Rate Algorithms for Exploratory DNA Microarray Studies,"The problem of detecting differential gene expression with mi- croarray data has led to further innovative approaches to controlling false positives in multiple testing. False discovery rate (FDR) has been widely used as a measure of error in this multiple testing context. Direct estima- tion of FDR was recently proposed by Storey (2002, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 64, 479-498) as a substantially more powerful al- ternative to the traditional sequential FDR controlling procedure, pioneered by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 57, 289-300). Direct estimation to FDR requires fixing a rejection region of interest and then conservatively estimating the associated FDR. On the other hand, sequential FDR procedure requires fixing a FDR control level and then estimating the rejection region. Thus, sequential and direct approaches to FDR control appear very different. In this paper, we intro- duce a unified computational framework for sequential FDR methods and propose a class of more powerful sequential FDR algorithms, that link the direct and sequential approaches. Under the proposed unified compuational framework, both approaches simply approximate the least conservative (op- timal) sequential FDR procedure. We illustrate the FDR algorithms and concepts with some numerical studies (simulations) and with two real ex- ploratory DNA microarray studies, one on the detection of molecular signa- tures in BRCA-mutation breast cancer patients and another on the detection of genetic signatures during colon cancer initiation and progression in the rat.",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Danh V.

04469d155847b9e5eba11dfc4e2b7c8fe7ce26a0,Identification of genetic overlap and novel risk loci for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder,"Differential diagnosis between childhood onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BD) remains a challenge, mainly due to overlapping symptoms and high rates of comorbidity. Despite this, genetic correlation reported for these disorders is low and non-significant. Here we aimed to better characterize the genetic architecture of these disorders utilizing recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We analyzed independent GWAS summary statistics for ADHD (19,099 cases and 34,194 controls) and BD (20,352 cases and 31,358 controls) applying the conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (condFDR/conjFDR) statistical framework that increases the power to detect novel phenotype-specific and shared loci by leveraging the combined power of two GWAS. We observed cross-trait polygenic enrichment for ADHD conditioned on associations with BD, and vice versa. Leveraging this enrichment, we identified 19 novel ADHD risk loci and 40 novel BD risk loci at condFDR <0.05. Further, we identified five loci jointly associated with ADHD and BD (conjFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Interestingly, these five loci show concordant directions of effect for ADHD and BD. These results highlight a shared underlying genetic risk for ADHD and BD which may help to explain the high comorbidity rates and difficulties in differentiating between ADHD and BD in the clinic. Improving our understanding of the underlying genetic architecture of these disorders may aid in the development of novel stratification tools to help reduce these diagnostic difficulties.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kevin S.

1859c89cdf97683497dfc423f6a19fdf1c150830,Antisense Long Non-Coding RNAs Are Deregulated in Skin Tissue of Patients withÂ Systemic Sclerosis.,"Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of skin and multiple organs of which the pathogenesis is poorly understood. We studied differentially expressed coding and non-coding genes in relation to systemic sclerosis pathogenesis with a specific focus on antisense non-coding RNAs. Skin biopsy-derived RNAs from 14 early systemic sclerosis patients and six healthy individuals were sequenced with ion-torrent and analyzed using DEseq2. Overall, 4,901 genes with a fold change >1.5 and a false discovery rate <5% were detected in patients versus controls. Upregulated genes clustered in immunologic, cell adhesion, and keratin-related processes. Interestingly, 676 deregulated non-coding genes were detected, 257 of which were classified as antisense genes. Sense genes expressed opposite of these antisense genes were also deregulated in 42% of the observed sense-antisense gene pairs. The majority of the antisense genes had a similar effect sizes in an independent North American dataset with three genes (CTBP1-AS2, OTUD6B-AS1, and AGAP2-AS1) exceeding the study-wide Bonferroni-corrected P-value (PBonf < 0.0023, PcombinedÂ = 1.1Â Ã— 10-9, 1.4Â Ã— 10-8, 1.7Â Ã— 10-6, respectively). In this study, we highlight that together with coding genes, (antisense) long non-coding RNAs are deregulated in skin tissue of systemic sclerosis patients suggesting a novel class of genes involved in pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tobias C Messemaker"", ids = ""5002192""); list(name = ""Loubna Chadli"", ids = ""49107830""); list(name = ""Guoshuai Cai"", ids = ""49343686""); list(name = ""Varshna S.

c2c2f0020162e7110a9424036498c63060dd180f,Serum proteomic profiles of depressive subtypes,"Depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Accumulating evidence suggests biological and genetic differences between subtypes of depression that are homogeneous in symptom presentation. We aimed to evaluate differences in serum protein profiles between persons with atypical and melancholic depressive subtypes, and compare these profiles with serum protein levels of healthy controls. We used the baseline data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety on 414 controls, 231 persons with a melancholic depressive subtype and 128 persons with an atypical depressive subtype for whom the proteomic data were available. Depressive subtypes were previously established using a data-driven analysis, and 171 serum proteins were measured on a multi-analyte profiling platform. Linear regression models were adjusted for several covariates and corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate q-values. We observed differences in analytes between the atypical and melancholic subtypes (9 analytes, q<0.05) and between atypical depression and controls (23 analytes, q<0.05). Eight of the nine markers differing between the atypical and melancholic subtype overlapped with markers from the comparison between atypical subtype and controls (mesothelin, leptin, IGFBP1, IGFBP2, FABPa, insulin, C3 and B2M), and were mainly involved in cellular communication and signal transduction, and immune response. No markers differed significantly between the melancholic subtype and controls. To conclude, although some uncertainties exist in our results as a result of missing data imputation and lack of proteomic replication samples, many of the identified analytes are inflammatory or metabolic markers, which supports the notion of atypical depression as a syndrome characterized by metabolic disturbances and inflammation, and underline the importance and relevance of subtypes of depression in biological and genetic research, and potentially in the treatment of depression.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Femke Lamers"", ids = ""2361959""); list(name = ""Mariska Bot"", ids = ""5454447""); list(name = ""Rick Jansen"", ids = ""145625746""); list(name = ""Man K.

In this article, we studied the multiplicity problem caused by simultaneously monitoring more than one attribute quality variable. Multiple binomial and Poisson CUSUM charts incorporating a multiple hypothesis testing technique known as false discovery rate control were proposed. The procedures for establishing the new control schemes were presented, and the performance of the new methods was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. The approximation methods for obtaining the p-values of the CUSUM statistics for conducting the new control schemes were also provided and evaluated. The new methods were also illustrated with a real example.

5dd01e7cee8f6b4e132903368f81cf4cf404f1d1,hmmSeq: A hidden Markov model for detecting differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data,"We introduce hmmSeq, a model-based hierarchical Bayesian technique for detecting differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data. Our novel hmmSeq methodology uses hidden Markov models to account for potential co-expression of neighboring genes. In addition, hmmSeq employs an integrated approach to studies with technical or biological replicates, automatically adjusting for any extra-Poisson variability. Moreover, for cases when paired data are available, hmmSeq includes a paired structure between treatments that incoporates subject-specific effects. To perform parameter estimation for the hmmSeq model, we develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Further, we develop a procedure for detection of differentially expressed genes that automatically controls false discovery rate. A simulation study shows that the hmmSeq methodology performs better than competitors in terms of receiver operating characteristic curves.

We identified that 464 genes, including at least 17 transcription factors, are significantly induced by 2-h LPS stimulation using a high-density bovine microarray platform at a very stringent false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰0%. The networks show that, in the LPS-stimulated PBMCs, altered gene expression was transcriptionally regulated via those transcription factors through potential interaction within the pathway networks. Functional analyses revealed that LPS induces unique pathways, molecular functions, biological processes, and gene networks.

b61f7635b2715e1ada8d3a55f013b64655b3d85c,Rank-invariant resampling based estimation of false discovery rate for analysis of small sample microarray data,"BackgroundThe evaluation of statistical significance has become a critical process in identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray studies. Classical p-value adjustment methods for multiple comparisons such as family-wise error rate (FWER) have been found to be too conservative in analyzing large-screening microarray data, and the False Discovery Rate (FDR), the expected proportion of false positives among all positives, has been recently suggested as an alternative for controlling false positives. Several statistical approaches have been used to estimate and control FDR, but these may not provide reliable FDR estimation when applied to microarray data sets with a small number of replicates.ResultsWe propose a rank-invariant resampling (RIR) based approach to FDR evaluation. Our proposed method generates a biologically relevant null distribution, which maintains similar variability to observed microarray data. We compare the performance of our RIR-based FDR estimation with that of four other popular methods. Our approach outperforms the other methods both in simulated and real microarray data.ConclusionWe found that the SAM's random shuffling and SPLOSH approaches were liberal and the other two theoretical methods were too conservative while our RIR approach provided more accurate FDR estimation than the other approaches.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nitin Jain"", ids = ""145569361""); list(name = ""HyungJun Cho"", ids = ""1701383""); list(name = ""Michael O'Connell"", ids = ""1400891694""); list(name = ""Jae K.

ecc8b36113a18028dcde55cb2431d857dd97bb42,Analysis of the gene-protein interaction network in glioma.,"Glioma is the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Great progress has been achieved in glioma treatment, but the protein-protein interaction networks underlining glioma are poorly understood. We identified the protein-protein interaction network for glioma based on gene expression and predicted biological pathways underlying the molecular complexes in the network. Genes involved in glioma were selected from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. A literature search was performed using the Agilent Literature Search plugin, and Cytoscape was used to establish a protein-protein interaction network. The molecular complexes in the network were detected using the Clusterviz plugin, and pathway enrichment of molecular complexes was performed using DAVID online. There were 378 glioma genes in the OMIM database. The protein-protein interaction network in glioma contained 1814 nodes, 6471 edges, and 8 molecular complexes. There were 17 pathways (false discovery rate <1), which were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, oocyte meiosis, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, transmembrane transport of small molecules, metabolism of amino acids, and notch signaling pathway, among others.

We present new modifications of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure that incorporate the discrete structure of the data in an appropriate way. These new procedures are theoretically proved to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for any fixed number of null hypotheses. A strong point of our FDR controlling methodology is that it allows to incorporate at once the discreteness and the quantity of signal of the data (so called ""$\pi_0$-adaptation "").

c82cf260fa18276ca5dcced48d8cae1ad3e1a7f0,An efficient rigorous approach for identifying statistically significant frequent itemsets,"As advances in technology allow for the collection, storage, and analysis of vast amounts of data, the task of screening and assessing the significance of discovered patterns is becoming a major challenge in data mining applications. In this work, we address significance in the context of frequent itemset mining. Specifically, we develop a novel methodology to identify a meaningful support threshold s* for a dataset, such that the number of itemsets with support at least s* represents a substantial deviation from what would be expected in a random dataset with the same number of transactions and the same individual item frequencies. These itemsets can then be flagged as statistically significant with a small false discovery rate.
 Our methodology hinges on a Poisson approximation to the distribution of the number of itemsets in a random dataset with support at least s, for any s greater than or equal to a minimum threshold smin. We obtain this result through a novel application of the Chen-Stein approximation method, which is of independent interest. Based on this approximation, we develop an efficient parametric multi-hypothesis test for identifying the desired threshold s*.

Cities face rapid changes leading to increasing inequalities and emerging public health issues that require cost-effective interventions. The urban exposome concept refers to the continuous monitoring of urban environmental and health indicators using the city and smaller intra-city areas as measurement units in an interdisciplinary approach that combines qualitative and quantitative methods from social sciences, to epidemiology and exposure assessment.


Methods
In this proof of concept study, drinking water and quality of life indicators were described as part of the development of the urban exposome of Limassol (Cyprus) and were combined with agnostic environment-wide association analysis. This study was conducted as a two-part project with a qualitative part assessing the perceptions of city stakeholders, and quantitative part using a cross-sectional study design (an urban population study). We mapped the water quality parameters and participants' opinions on city life (i.e., neighborhood life, health care, and green space access) using quarters (small administrative areas) as the reference unit of the city. In an exploratory, agnostic, environment-wide association study analysis, we used all variables (questionnaire responses and water quality metrics) to describe correlations between them.


Results
Overall, urban drinking-water quality using conventional indicators of chemical (disinfection byproducts-trihalomethanes (THM)) and microbial (coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococci) quality did not raise particular concerns. The general health and chronic health status of the urban participants were significantly (false discovery rate corrected p-value < 0.1) associated with different health conditions such as hypertension and asthma, as well as having financial issues in access to dental care. Additionally, correlations between THM exposures and participant behavioral characteristics (e.g., household cleaning, drinking water habits) were documented.


Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study showed the potential of using integrative approaches to develop urban exposomic profiles and identifying within-city differences in environmental and health indicators. The characterization of the urban exposome of Limassol will be expanded via the inclusion of biomonitoring tools and untargeted metabolomics.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xanthi D.

c6764455c14f5b0733f5f666782f483ab0511ba6,Can microRNA profiling in maternal blood identify women at risk for preterm birth?,"OBJECTIVE
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are highly conserved single-stranded noncoding RNAs that play a crucial role in gene regulation, have now been identified as important players in many diseases states. MiRNAs have also been demonstrated to be reliable and useful biomarkers to identify those women who are at risk for specific adverse outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine whether miRNA profiles in maternal blood are different in women who are destined to have a preterm, compared with a term, birth.


STUDY DESIGN
A nested case-control study was performed with maternal serum that was collected as part of a larger prospective cohort. MiRNA expression profiles in maternal serum were compared between women who ultimately had a preterm birth (n = 40) compared with term birth (n = 40). MiRNA expression profiles were created with the use of the Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA Array. The data were analyzed with the significance of analysis of microarrays and principle components analyses. A false discovery rate of 20% was used to determine the most differentially expressed miRNAs.


RESULTS
Of the 5640 miRNAs that were analyzed on the array, 4 miRNAs were significantly different between cases and control subjects. Two of the 4 miRNAs were mature miRNAs. The fold difference in expression was <2 for all 4 miRNAs.


CONCLUSION
MiRNA profiles in maternal blood were not significantly different in women who were destined to have a preterm, compared with a term, birth. MiRNAs in maternal blood are unlikely to become clinically useful biomarkers for the prediction of preterm birth.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michal A Elovitz"", ids = ""4181987""); list(name = ""Lauren Anton"", ids = ""143922608""); list(name = ""Jamie A.

A major challenge is to transform IMS-TOFMS to a high-sensitivity, high-throughput platform, for example, for proteomics applications. In this work, we have developed and integrated three advanced technologies, including efficient ion accumulation in an ion funnel trap prior to IMS separation, multiplexing (MP) of ion packet introduction into the IMS drift tube, and signal detection with an analog-to-digital converter, into the IMS-TOFMS system for the high-throughput analysis of highly complex proteolytic digests of, for example, blood plasma. To better address variable sample complexity, we have developed and rigorously evaluated a novel dynamic MP approach that ensures correlation of the analyzer performance with an ion source function and provides the improved dynamic range and sensitivity throughout the experiment. The MP IMS-TOFMS instrument has been shown to reliably detect peptides at a concentration of 1 nM in the presence of a highly complex matrix, as well as to provide a 3 orders of magnitude dynamic range and a mass measurement accuracy of better than 5 ppm. When matched against human blood plasma database, the detected IMS-TOF features were found to yield approximately 700 unique peptide identifications at a false discovery rate (FDR) of approximately 7.5%. Accounting for IMS information gave rise to a projected FDR of approximately 4%. Signal reproducibility was found to be greater than 80%, while the variations in the number of unique peptide identifications were <15%. A single sample analysis was completed in 15 min that constitutes almost 1 order of magnitude improvement compared to a more conventional LC-MS approach.",2008,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mikhail E.

In this paper, we propose an optimal false discovery rate controlling method that is especially useful for such oneâ€sided testing problems. The proposed procedure is optimal in the sense of minimizing the false nonâ€discovery rate while controlling the false discovery rate at a preâ€specified level; it uses a deconvolution method based on nonâ€parametric maximum likelihood estimation, which allows for a broader class of treatment effect distributions than existing methods do. The proposed test demonstrates good smallâ€sample performance in Monte Carlo simulations and it is applied to study the effect of attending a more selective high school in Romania. The application reveals strong evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity, in that students who marginally gain access to higherâ€ranked schools are more likely to benefit if the higherâ€ranked school has a relatively high admission score cutâ€off â€“ or, in other words, is more selective.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jiaying Gu"", ids = ""9534148""); list(name = ""Shu Hao Shen"", ids = ""49516697"")",deec5d691cec9236693034766834af1c08a74194; 1105ce2578476521ace246eabed218265faba3f1,1cd5c9c208fb0cfe49c950603f02d4381025aeae; af2a8675a1c160c17d66a0fb2a22a210d6d7eabe; b506aeea3bc636939aef71d78d19e7b3479b0152; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 69bb25437e986f0069e5968f8aedf5debe6b9ccb; 73e718754bad3f7f699b75aa86b4ce62af927100; 89e9c539db6ffd2cb477b314a0ac8ba593473125; b4a12471ae376c2b070dc5e9631b83c545eb0451; 5412be7581819cd36d5123ab7571f336753472e3; e4700df93db983122fd26ca444d0d0b7fbf1041d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c1a61ed05fb8bd960cd8b463b0caabb63ae64ea3; 2c64d50c9a9eb1deefb90e3f719f0a2da403e56d; 94d642ba3b0f46109dfe531509a910475fb33366; f5da6507c5a424e52fd6ab79d2dd72a44a947bde; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0; 5c5becc796db9bb107d4908f40746d82ccae0fe4; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; e042379b0f7147710b3a8ad8c30b8499c1544ec5; a99385a7ac109e8b6b9bc19b1a8f62ca316e83e6; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 83d10adb98319ab3fcc15dfa44dd3f7ff80e4bda; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a15fbe350902efa04b821c763c2dcbe8cacb249f; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 48dfa03f2bc315534c3d08b7bf9c4cc93fc39450; 7234c244a4e560b44ba2e61768b2d4f5de0d40f9; dff24b4b3c88178607eac910fd21526d80423dad; 13408589ae501df86a0207a496e1ea925d7a90f0; 6ea412eb5f4b53ee6796e50026d695b1eddd938b; 7673542fa740593b80fed6fa78743aabff0710aa; 8eebca60b012855877842e7aa4c6a08543421b1c; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; b14d5d9d7309a721d13438d8d395df4545ebbd02; c824343ac540d3bafd7c4eaadb10fb7a1d8e5c76,Econometrics Journal,21,11-35
17d55b4c1f3285cf2fc10be850def9842193e382,Automatic detection of outlying microarrays using multi-array quality metrics,Gene-chip microarrays are used to measure changes on transcript level induced by various experimental conditions. Due to many sources of potential measurement errors quality control of data is critical in these experiments. We propose an automatic method for finding poor quality microarrays which is based on two known multi-array quality metrics and linear regression model. Removing of low quality samples has a big influence on increasing the amount of association between measurements and it increases the number of obtained differentially expressed genes decreasing false discovery rate. It also leads to obtaining more significant ontology terms found by functional analysis of differentially expressed genes and helps discovering genes which are biologically consistent with analyzed problem.,2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Michal Marczyk"", ids = ""50273817""); list(name = ""Lukasz Krol"", ids = ""144998629""); list(name = ""Joanna PolaÅ„ska"", ids = ""49399310"")",6b102183ba398d66a7c680df6ab233fbb633eca2; 0847652aae614a791fd20532dc9f60d1722d0460,6389752e61f425e534724da317e45db5bef35961; 7485962a41ddfcf8c3d13783f962c297a4d62d49; 3ecf188fc42fe0d01d217fd482d173f7444798ae; 988de145cc4908064ad1f358136150289a5d3a55; 6dbf357331cba3bd1d3a44513ac59af1a82e48de; e76f9b50325d44b06e2b90ac65996afd5a06b4d8; 5ca1d583e53ca84287a8767b7289dbd6fc4f46ed; de623ec9dbbd4cdb29925dd215cfe0c4399cdb6a; cd8744103e4b043ee3b6d69866cc341b4557ccbb; e3c82468e3e5229d905b6c6a0605dc2a28756bf9; 9716e92e804e06500b3eccf3bcefd969422a26ce; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 893a9e58fe19750046757fb8d14163ed4860e82a,,,738-746
7e9f209e3ffc3fd39ce40cff572454abfa6f1696,The Promise of Selecting Individuals from the Extremes of Exposure in the Analysis of Gene-Physical Activity Interactions,"Background: Dichotomization using the lower quartile as cutoff is commonly used for harmonizing heterogeneous physical activity (PA) measures across studies. However, this may create misclassification and hinder discovery of new loci. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of selecting individuals from the extremes of the exposure (SIEE) as an alternative approach to reduce such misclassification. Method: For systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the Framingham Heart Study, we performed a genome-wide association study with gene-PA interaction analysis using three PA variables derived by SIEE and two other dichotomization approaches. We compared number of loci detected and overlap with loci found using a quantitative PA variable. In addition, we performed simulation studies to assess bias, false discovery rates (FDR), and power under synergistic/antagonistic genetic effects in exposure groups and in the presence/absence of measurement error. Results: In the empirical analysis, SIEEâ€™s performance was neither the best nor the worst. In most simulation scenarios, SIEE was consistently outperformed in terms of FDR and power. Particularly, in a scenario characterized by antagonistic effects and measurement error, SIEE had the least bias and highest power. Conclusion: SIEEâ€™s promise appears limited to detecting loci with antagonistic effects. Further studies are needed to evaluate SIEEâ€™s full advantage.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Oyomoare L Osazuwa-Peters"", ids = ""1404118527""); list(name = ""Karen Schwander"", ids = ""5566607""); list(name = ""R J Waken"", ids = ""1441311227""); list(name = ""Lisa de Las Fuentes"", ids = ""6299720""); list(name = ""Tuomas O KilpelÃ¤inen"", ids = ""5507989""); list(name = ""Ruth J.

cb3cea334a9a76cab59facc2dcd3ea0d14fcaaa5,"SV-AUTOPILOT: optimized, automated construction of structural variation discovery and benchmarking pipelines","BackgroundMany tools exist to predict structural variants (SVs), utilizing a variety of algorithms. However, they have largely been developed and tested on human germline or somatic (e.g. cancer) variation. It seems appropriate to exploit this wealth of technology available for humans also for other species. Objectives of this work included:a)Creating an automated, standardized pipeline for SV prediction.b)Identifying the best tool(s) for SV prediction through benchmarking.c)Providing a statistically sound method for merging SV calls.ResultsThe SV-AUTOPILOT meta-tool platform is an automated pipeline for standardization of SV prediction and SV tool development in paired-end next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. SV-AUTOPILOT comes in the form of a virtual machine, which includes all datasets, tools and algorithms presented here. The virtual machine easily allows one to add, replace and update genomes, SV callers and post-processing routines and therefore provides an easy, out-of-the-box environment for complex SV discovery tasks. SV-AUTOPILOT was used to make a direct comparison between 7 popular SV tools on the Arabidopsis thaliana genome using the Landsberg (Ler) ecotype as a standardized dataset. Recall and precision measurements suggest that Pindel and Clever were the most adaptable to this dataset across all size ranges while Delly performed well for SVs larger than 250 nucleotides. A novel, statistically-sound merging process, which can control the false discovery rate, reduced the false positive rate on the Arabidopsis benchmark dataset used here by >60%.ConclusionSV-AUTOPILOT provides a meta-tool platform for future SV tool development and the benchmarking of tools on other genomes using a standardized pipeline. It optimizes detection of SVs in non-human genomes using statistically robust merging. The benchmarking in this study has demonstrated the power of 7 different SV tools for analyzing different size classes and types of structural variants. The optional merge feature enriches the call set and reduces false positives providing added benefit to researchers planning to validate SVs.

0ea1d4ec2e8fc1901af27b71019a2fde0201549b,Statistical issues when searching for predictors of post-Lyme disease symptoms.,"TO THE EDITORâ€”This letter is in regard to the recently published article by Strle et al [1]. The article covers the important topic of post-Lyme symptoms and it claims that â€œhigh TH17-associated immune responses, often accompanied by autoantibodies, correlated with postLyme symptoms, providing a new paradigm for the study of post-infectious symptoms in a subset of patients with Lyme disease.â€ Their study compared levels of 15 cytokines and 11 chemokines in 45 subjects with post-Lyme symptoms versus corresponding levels in 41 subjects without post-Lyme symptoms. In addition, the 26 potential predictors were also measured for 22 healthy subjects and further comparisons were made between these subjects and the subjects with Lyme disease. There are 2 major issues with the statistical methods chosen by the authors for analyzing the study data. The first major issue is the lack of multiplicity adjustments: â€œOf the 15 cytokines and 11 chemokines tested, the only significant differences between groups were in the levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-23 [interleukin 23]. Therefore, only the results of these mediators are presented here.â€ Even if we consider only the comparisons done for the levels at the initial visit between the 45 subjects with and the 41 subjects without post-Lyme symptoms, there would be a total of 26 different comparisons. Using a significance level of .05, random data are expected to yield 1 falsely significant result (5% of 26 tests). To adjust for a large false discovery rate, P values are adjusted in cases with many comparisons: see, for instance, Holm [2]. For Holmâ€™s procedure, the 26 P values would be ordered from smallest to largest and the smallest P value would be multiplied by 26, the second largest by 25, and so on. The authorsâ€™ claim that â€œIL-23 levels were significantly higher in the postLyme group at study entryâ€ is based on a P value of .02 (Figure 3A in [1]), which was the only significant P value <.05 out of the 26 performed comparisons. The right analysis would have adjusted that P value to .52, which would be far away from significance. The data graphs themselves show a large overlap in IL-23 levels between the groups, and one can reasonably assume that the difference could be due to simple random variation when testing 26 different mediators. The second major issue is the fact that â€œsamples with undetectable cytokine levels were not included in the analysis.â€ A visual count of the IL-23 levels in Figure 2B [1] shows only 18 of the 45 of the erythema migrans (EM) subjects with symptoms, and 23 of the 41 EM subjects without symptoms graphed. The authors then claim that the median IL-23 of subjects with symptoms is statistically higher than the median IL-23 of subjects without symptoms. When the number of undetectable results is large, one cannot simply ignore those values which are close to 0; in fact, according to the count, the median IL-23 level of the EM subjects with symptoms should be undetectable as 27 of 45 subjects had undetectable levels. Censored data analysis methods such as the ones described in Amemiya [3] should be employed with data of this type.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mihaela PÃ¢rvu"", ids = ""13954817""); list(name = ""Valentin Parvu"", ids = ""5036472"")",647fe06729aea12a93923d673dab640a8a879f45; a344b81231f46100623c4fc069e9399438312ea6,b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 8c647d9687aec4c449d3277e435daf0f314ea110; 73b5b702718f2d4e66cb530b6a7e847fecb6eba2,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,58 8,"

On the other hand, power is an important measure of performance for multiple testing. Due to practical constraints, the number of replications per null may not be large enough. For the case where the population fraction of false nulls is constant, we show that, as the difference between false and true nulls becomes increasingly subtle while the number of replications per null cannot increase fast enough: (1) in order to have enough chance that the data to be collected will yield some trustworthy findings, as measured by a conditional version of the positive false discovery rate (pFDR), the volume of data has to grow at a rate much faster than in the case where the number of replications per null can be large enough; and (2) in order to control the pFDR asymptotically, power has to decay to 0 in a rate highly sensitive to rejection criterion and there is no asymptotically most powerful procedures among those that control the pFDR asymptotically at the same level.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zhiyi Chi"", ids = ""3140471"")",,9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 118f4f5aa858470831302a559ae684daec6308f1; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 467966480503191520274a4b865ed23ba0594977; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; 92013517811f387db2d75b6f81a524813c760218; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 40cd5a0c53f6f971931350eecdc9390382388be2; 242f5ea2cb10b72dec27a309f468884d39182904,Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods,38,2784 - 2803
d59c408d5746a5bb34bf687563c3b546f71f3d3f,Interpreting Black Box Models with Statistical Guarantees,"While many methods for interpreting machine learning models have been proposed, they are frequently ad hoc, difficult to evaluate, and come with no statistical guarantees on the error rate. This is especially problematic in scientific domains, where interpretations must be accurate and reliable. In this paper, we cast black box model interpretation as a hypothesis testing problem. The task is to discover ""important"" features by testing whether the model prediction is significantly different from what would be expected if the features were replaced with randomly-sampled counterfactuals. We derive a multiple hypothesis testing framework for finding important features that enables control over the false discovery rate. We propose two testing methods, as well as analogs of one-sided and two-sided tests. In simulation, the methods have high power and compare favorably against existing interpretability methods. When applied to vision and language models, the framework selects features that intuitively explain model predictions.",2019,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Collin Burns"", ids = ""90909974""); list(name = ""Jesse Thomason"", ids = ""2665873""); list(name = ""Wesley Tansey"", ids = ""145305182"")",bd25261b387ef413124b84b2f7869883887d4aed; 848316eeb07ae32242af1a7a282d3e13b2343f93; 15af81437ebd2689af77e720bb81c4d651110e57; 96787cbdd0bd9011878255fae95d996f5b94c14c,28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 923fe895aa9a65ed9b9afeebe6c2c4935353ddcc; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 649d03490ef72c5274e3bccd03d7a299d2f8da91; 7380e343dd4547e21d5118b16daf03d021d98c4e; 6b0bbf3e7df725cc3b781d2648e41782cb3d8539; d1f788e9ac58de5d2dc6a3928939b411cf9ec5a6; e8633d985e968d0b19d0c012aafcf987301bb6d8; a1b26914af2603d8a1cf48bf9e37546eb0a32deb; 8dc8f3e0127adc6985d4695e9b69d04717b2fde8; cb153ed5e58ee082d3af44f3c009956c97bb19a8; d516daff247f7157fccde6649ace91d969cd1973; 93b8da28d006415866bf48f9a6e06b5242129195; f302e136c41db5de1d624412f68c9174cf7ae8be; f74a35817569f6ef989d650321a277da25073fe4; d5bbb65e6257204298f2c4fff01b25aa62b86389; 7ccc073c58f9be247eaa56bae37bea652c17ce29; 509b63e1f5ca0ad0bc13f863a3cb562f148fc2c5; 8348611b52aac208aece3068802ff06c891e1b74; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dbde7dfa6cae81df8ac19ef500c42db96c3d1edd; e8574795f4fbf5bd338246a57e79f63515718645; abb569b5b79365f57e7d20150b31bf65da89f275; 850e3676a1288939ad299d69a5f02ac8d596cb91; dc6ac3437f0a6e64e4404b1b9d188394f8a3bf71; df2b0e26d0599ce3e70df8a9da02e51594e0e992; e7eef2ac4136ec93bd306d2c9c353a13729a4553; 442e10a3c6640ded9408622005e3c2a8906ce4c2; bee044c8e8903fb67523c1f8c105ab4718600cdb; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 5091316bb1c6db6c6a813f4391911a5c311fdfe0; 204e3073870fae3d05bcbc2f6a8e263d9b72e776; e51f48fe145a40eb842732d1987cdb23209fbcd9; ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728,ArXiv,abs/1904.00045,
08e51ddefcbf18ac0fcab02381f035291491d441,QuickMMCTest - Higher accuracy for multiple testing corrections,"Multiple hypothesis testing is widely used to evaluate scientific studies involving statistical tests. However, for many of these tests, exact p-values are not available and thus p-values are often approximated using Monte-Carlo tests such as permutation tests or bootstrap tests. This is typically done by drawing a constant number of replicates or permutations to estimate the p-value of each hypothesis. The estimates are then used as input for procedures which correct for the multiplicity, for instance by controlling the Familywise Error Rate or the False Discovery Rate. This article introduces QuickMMCTest, a new heuristic method to assess the statistical significance of multiple hypotheses. Moreover, this article compares QuickMMCTest to three other methods in a simulation study, namely to a naive approach which draws a constant number of replicates or permutations for each hypothesis, to the recent MCFDR algorithm and to the MMCTest algorithm. Using the same number of replicates or permutations QuickMMCTest yields considerably better results in terms of misclassifications than the other three methods.",2014,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Axel Gandy"", ids = ""2559159""); list(name = ""Georg Hahn"", ids = ""47969459"")",30164f63203a0805716c8fc70f65a24cbd32532e; 77fa5c87b6b6820c4e1553f8613fe54576abbf46,c9438a9fd7d03c6691ca58c74b47d8daf6a0e5ca; a1239adf05b9d8127aa190b90229d13f603d35fe; 0427e897a10582f7822e0c1ab5bef0459d8dfe59; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; 4d67ab77b0f056125588f2f2486c18294f5e28f5; fe84c3143170761d017f10d2c3a5016b40ba0219; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b7b3d9f0c7f7f8b06d68901cfbe9567514aaa3bd; 863310128c776b2d801b9bf265d99ef6ec0f4b58; d43096643a629709f932bf1fb7a13e08cbd8f92b; c2c60a5d08d3a1ea7273e04ea28116735be479c4; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c; 86fce03c5a932e7cf842238769588a846ec8559b; cf7eefa4e5c001ef4f31067831ac1bd281f09ccd; ba81416f442dcc50beb69b5492a1b7636dc61090; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 06b43caa6a1a0281a728c011f1dbde237f6317a3; ea4ffbb3d628cd0739b04b67a1d4c3c7ccf75beb; 166c42895882039e4252f7c943efa13d0505109f; 7eb8e28fa7652519fc7e9db95fcde3c60240cd8e; 40921752bcf861206a4475b38d4fd80a529061a8; 8a152bd2e5d4dafb5a1f1131890415016bc969e2; 4b4e8a5ca3c2643fb0b2c4083d7f9e8b3c8d691e; 5a343015d755a9001a26287b7a92028b5d026617; 5995a2b4645bd73cd4b19d3c44d6a96382d5c880; ee2cd1d17f833d3c157a1016a778c7c22af555a2; 3e93403b8949995bb2f503656855a8789ad12c9a,,,
299ae75fb8e47aa651793f890bcb2f57239cd4c9,Identification of genes and pathways related to lipopolysaccharide signaling in duckling spleens.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, activates the immune system and threatens the health of livestock and poultry. However, little is known about the genes and pathways involved in the immune response of ducklings to LPS. To elucidate the genes involved in the response of 7-day-old duckling spleens treated with LPS, RNA from LPS-treated and control duckling spleens was analyzed by RNA-Seq. The results showed 11,095 and 10,840 genes with >10 clean reads in the LPS-treated and control groups, respectively. Among these genes, 89 were differentially expressed (log2 ratio â‰¥ 1, P â‰¤ 0.01, false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.001); 67 of these were upregulated and 22 were downregulated in the LPS-treated group compared to the control. GO and GO-rich analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in 13 functional categories (P < 0.05). Pathway analysis and pathway richness analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in six pathway categories (P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that some immune system-related signaling pathways, such as the hematopoietic cell lineage, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, and chemokine signaling pathway, are active during the immune response. To confirm the RNA-Seq results, we detected CCL4, LBP, CD71, and STEAP3 expression using real-time PCR analysis, and the results were consistent with the RNA-Seq results. Our results provide new information on the genes involved in the immune response of duckling spleens to LPS.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bo Deng"", ids = ""145354893""); list(name = ""Tian-qing Yu"", ids = ""144734078""); list(name = ""Wentong Liu"", ids = ""2021615""); list(name = ""Shengqiang Ye"", ids = ""48928046""); list(name = ""Lixian Wang"", ids = ""2385603""); list(name = ""Yi Yang"", ids = ""1698559""); list(name = ""Ping Gong"", ids = ""145197104""); list(name = ""Z P Ran"", ids = ""47659969""); list(name = ""Haibo Huang"", ids = ""48185959""); list(name = ""Jing Hua Wen"", ids = ""144711580"")",,43f367c28c4b86356c474b3b526301917d395b4b; c5a756ba74b7790dc8f7d235caebaf0aca9c0a3c; b537710b99528a61492e94ef80c9da98d33458f5; 4d2b4bc5492c9a2dcdf331c473c8c7aa7d18b078; 579c316b23ddb21bd055b85f587486b6fed4b48f; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 37ae781d2bcfaa94886b7151c7f1b111bf4039bf; be89293c6b51ca357c1792dcd2375bcba73c7eaa; 909c8f90bbc17bdcac1f5f6696333edb2ebc5ccf; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 03493c7359ca73d37a5f23d897297309554d444e; 3519969eef4c19d2b80de87e6c7a618ccbd48440; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; edd0b36db887a981cf07b383fb9d6597805a1847; e4afa092e07f3652d0ac729d4983455e99291b6d; 1a3644247b1fffb809847e598ce548051fc8a0c1; 796c12880b06e53a816fa2e9e4cc79238e09ac02; 88a5da39ca7b355597a1700ac03f9faa1036d692; 26aa911967bcafe27dd168c9516d2fcd1de0783d; 8af35ed7461d364e66585180a9720a7acf015e07; 5285648acfd4ab315127faf3829f50cf0e92428b; e7b01112c7ac45229680b0566562c376b051e4cd; 48625447750c4a4f8473b79a73191f8892357563; 270b4ec578c675e4858a106b818cd280ad13d654; d16c72ba11ba9ee16bc65ae6c2917a40541b36d0; f4a84e68633d88a0f2ed04c09399d30cd62154b0; be9b145d593ac7b93f3c344180413353215a5988; 8bc8162784350da65fcc4ea0da5eb1bedc3093a0; 1cc3272bfff4ce3b3f7f9b435cf4cf7dc4fd28de; 6fa127e33b5ce2050dca9fc3302b7deb6c47f050; 67443d6e3bd2b39e5bc6cb9d370434b5dc7144da; 3ff4db26a72987f5b6176fc801a50ac48f7081d4,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,14 4,"

In the present study, miRNA expression profiles of the cumulus cell samples were determined by miRNA microarrays. Quantification of selected miRNAs and predicted target genes was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed that miR-483-5p and miR-486-5p are significantly decreased in cumulus cells of PCOS patients PCOS (fold change >2, false discovery rate <0.001). qRT-PCR found that four predicted genes, SOCS3, SRF, PTEN and FOXO1, were significantly increased in PCOS cumulus cells (all P < 0.001), and IGF2 (host gene of miR-483-5p) was significantly decreased in PCOS cumulus cells (P < 0.001). These results indicated that miR-483-5p might play an important role in reducing insulin resistance, and that miR-486-5p might promote cumulus cell proliferation through activation of PI3K/Akt. The findings from this study provided new insights into the complex molecular mechanisms involved in PCOS by revealing pathways possibly regulated by miRNAs. The differences in miRNAs (miR-483-5p, miR-486-5p) and their target gene expression in cumulus cells may provide clues for future research and help to explain aberrant follicular development and subfertility in women with PCOS.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lin Shi"", ids = ""48138425""); list(name = ""Shan Liu"", ids = ""51197045""); list(name = ""Wanqiu Zhao"", ids = ""49260793""); list(name = ""Juanzi Shi"", ids = ""144531170"")",67980805273cba1a60a5888d6be8f2c2350fbe01; 80ea9273a16ebc3d89e23a3b48feb7d138569701; aeb197357b0f91d1de0bcca88558f059b4a136b5; 1cbbdd6b76f1b64c05c5183a5a3e4f19b3a4e56b; c6f8a7e79259427b86afd31f12201fdcdf027ad7; 88c621cde1f858757535e10f8169555405fb7d3d; ab7e8a21e4439e2ac3345df8bea6edcfa7d0fe5e; 5f537b6521a9b7b890a9d58d4ba896b8ba471376; d1c13dc00a80e46caeae49d78473bf58b0739943; d7780b54ec6ea30d1d5031612a06b0249c644ea1; 803bfed12e65bd9b8522c30299ac7df3fa01c4c5; 0ead0fa02cb6342b4b5dd22bde7d7aa4d07fac0d; bf63dc50b16e115f69637860d3726b6ee9251127; 2e94e6900bc37aa2e73e3651cf3c8a61a8ab0f69; b4519610d504ca2747874644249b94741d5a6432; 0bdf831e9360fed0a56a64cb4036d487adf53c58; 824500cef73a8cdb2b6d5c0a2948165bdb80d7fe; df797427279159b078cb67c0740830759c5b55b5; 1d27a4dda4dee3a516fb5af41afae165c0c88bb6; 8fc0c5956bb94138fc1a8f8ed36839ceefb8f940; 848bac1617f915a8f94d47dbc1a2fef960b41c2c; b98678d3bfaec29ab55c0d67199efb224fbd078c; 48dec12e1f1e471ce98b866a9ab55c85b149acf8; d0b41c86c3a3018af89dc1ab369c327bf8048b33; f5a569d1186b1ce12d6528e099774909e91a5f4e,0024e63c7c222c8df931cb07fd26f8210f77613e; b46c8eed964fe9188be92e50f244bef020e3ff4a; d4bab80133e456b177b4466b6f42c5b0c189b896; 774389b2f4c8c9aa5ee34a6823af543debc11e16; 304b119787fb6aa8d99df3f3f642ce70b5ba6412; 07987431506d5203ab4d3965d6becc7293ffc85a; 346cc98fadd630c076756546fa11124768113067; 6c24ae9bdee1a78953d4c4e8b8687427f254306e; ed32d00cfc02e14e67777d8fb06269994efb938d; 65eca1577d11df221ee83c00827129252e5247f0; d4e95a80c823e32dd5cae9a811e3753a82ead0fb; dc8cb95e47a5dc1ccc0ee255d7e632a7aa401b3f; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 1fdd4ae287ba39d36dc768ab91e8cfcd6b5f97ad; 5c9f599d5249105733ff75485c7c9caa2de82da2; 2c374b90020b0feff94b29ca4c2d9043b04df4ae; 6ca7ac1ecde20b48749bdfba3cbaa02339e3a454; c370053df06e9228765b08370bfc2088a57ac968; 0cf2333afdd85dbd86d28d91be26ad5479b30b22; d07730c2ea6c0ab77429a27f7b941786e8e38d9b; e2a11abd71061b79ed483b09eb4254d3f2a2b124; 0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7; b98678d3bfaec29ab55c0d67199efb224fbd078c; d0c45d3ce2ef9a4c84ac0c4f8df933aba09e4aec; cf6b66bb3d501fbb89a6245af3d98d04bce7f457; 94c518caaa826159110f1d9fe7d79b88860f4a1e; d57b77a5abb6e6a8810b4a547ae328691affd4d5; 952868cb2bb12618a8ddb8339c85f61469f52196; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; ee549570e1e566a11c27f187ee33b11c99b67400; 0c906bb210319231e96f5b1556481dc63e755117; 2fe25636a5e8e7a8a66663c8bab7fa0b87d594dc; 42a8ff77e483252486c75221c3203b8804876b31; a0c2b1a5207ee02d7e2231fa2a208c3e9f1a46ae; c64d933783e6292acd5fd15b60c400ccf7a547f0; f3b2ade6751452453b4f2cf1128d08bcd3d80803; f7e457c0d78f7acc7dc53dfae7b599e228a7b30d; 29706157f051fa08ce44b335c5b888aaced69691; f73883ebde15a1079caa797503e9011fd6522f22; 302d6e7036df07e41a10b17c5c070671ca81d1bd; 395556a24bae04a10b70a25831698c8ed7288610; 8846621eb47ea314a072c81e11cc1e68f777c545; eba6d8ac32ee54f3931de7655e443873b1c491f9; e5341c589439d868fc94e3d39cc9c816c8e4ce1f; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 2f85c55bf1510976347b028f7a8dffa61dcc90e3; 49c614a5e02cd2c4bf285dac457ea3bbf5cf9747; 808bf0a7598f7da9789a32b5df579faff3ddd0ea; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 92109b1bd705edceb9d5cf5085dcbf7a5282b317; a79649c2a2d4b8bf39088c9dca2671e37938d471; 5a1da5b5440f032b00cedb6a1cc330c5c89d6dc9; c51e52ab7aef9df9a977940b26b8bf5e2c95e103; 85ec54e2f8e2b9888306c4d1862ced1d02a122d7; 07f516813b42967d67b77f7f3eec77bb8ff8d4f3; b6987cab3e147a7e6fff3f8425ee32c2dccab493; b587ae47f2f09e07ecc0f373c8d576fd28c2a8f5; 91fc6c2db28c4c99c381a898f04ef70759dea736; 5525ee0b0fba2d8a1af1e455ccb1daeeea89c5c2; e9110448504e1ad849b11125079e3105022b97ce; fb17adfce37e2f2329de633966a6fe8eab8ffc09; cb461159df04d43b0e6686f43dc4c06a0640004c; 4a76c57e5daebe86b9eab895a29a14add36c59e2; 92440611b649d65bcfcf9633ee319331512df587; ec7f27d882e557aad64842c9fd666e5f014b6c06; a5e624dffc57b84af38ade5f77ba2a3706bbdc58; 2a37fa9457fb7b7565e826e3b377cc082b665502,Reproductive biomedicine online,31 4,"

The methods include an implementation of the Three-Level Hierarchical model for Clinical Trial Adverse Event Incidence Data of Berry and Berry (2004) , an implementation of the same model without the Point Mass (Model 1a from Xia et al (2011)), and extended Bayesian hierarchical methods based on system organ class or body-system groupings for interim analyses. The package also implements a number of methods for error control when testing multiple hypotheses, specifically control of the False Discovey Rate (FDR). The FDR control methods implemented are the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, the Double False Discovery Rate, the Group Benjamini-Hochberg and subset Benjamini-Hochberg methods. Also included are the Bonferroni correction and the unadjusted testing procedure.",2017,Engineering,"list(name = ""Raymond Carragher"", ids = ""48939701"")",,,,,

Both assays use serial dilution to provide a discrete, ranked readout of 8-14 categorical titer values for each sample. In contrast to other methods of measuring vaccine antibody levels that produce a continuous readout (i.e., mPLEX-Flu and ELISA), titering methods introduce imprecision and increase false discovery rates (FDR). In this paper, we assess the degree of such statistical errors, first with simulation studies comparing continuous data with titer data in influenza vaccine study group comparison analyses and then by analyzing actual sample data from an influenza vaccine trial. Our results show the superiority of using continuous, rather than discrete, readout assays. Compared to continuous readout assays, titering assays have a lower statistical precision and a higher FDR. The results suggested that traditional titering assays could lead to increased Type-II errors in the comparison of different therapeutic arms of an influenza vaccine trial. These statistical issues are related to the mathematical nature of titer-based assays, which we examine in detail in the simulation studies. Continuous readout assays are free of this issue, and thus it is possible that comparisons of study groups could provide different results with these two methods as we have shown in our case study.",2019,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dongmei Li"", ids = ""46598712""); list(name = ""Jiong Wang"", ids = ""48094225""); list(name = ""Jessica Garigen"", ids = ""40901091""); list(name = ""John J.

Motivated by such setting, in this work, a parallel sequential change detection model is investigated. In the model, a plurality of independent parallel data streams, each of which has a change-point with a certain prior probability distribution, are sequentially observed with a maximum sampling constraint. A sequential procedure is developed to inspect these parallel data streams and to decide, for each of them, whether a change has occurred. The sequential procedure is shown to guarantee the false discovery rate (FDR). The average detection delay over the parallel data streams is also quantified in asymptotic regimes. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed sequential procedure.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jian Jhen Chen"", ids = ""47740650""); list(name = ""Wenyi Zhang"", ids = ""1687481""); list(name = ""H.

We show that such selected intervals fail to provide the assumed coverage probability. By generalizing the false discovery rate (FDR) approach from multiple testing to selected multiple CIs, we suggest the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) as a measure of interval coverage following selection. A general procedure is then introduced, offering FCR control at level q under any selection rule. The procedure constructs a marginal CI for each selected parameter, but instead of the confidence level 1 âˆ’ q being used marginally, q is divided by the number of parameters considered and multiplied by the number selected. If we further use the FDR controlling testing procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg for selecting the parameters, the newly suggested procedure offers CIs that are dual to the testing procedure and are shown to be optimal in the independent case.

5a65efed91648d98df75203759a5828549ca9d04,Multiple Testing in Genomic Sequences Using Hamming Distance,High-dimensional categorical data models with small sample sizes have not been used extensively in genomic sequences that involve count (or discrete) or purely qualitative responses. A basic task is to identify differentially expressed genes (or positions) among a number of genes. It requires an appropriate test statistics and a corresponding multiple testing procedure so that a multivariate analysis of variance should not be feasible. A family wise error rate(FWER) is not appropriate to test thousands of genes simultaneously in a multiple testing procedure. False discovery rate(FDR) is better than FWER in multiple testing problems. The data from the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic shows that a conventional FDR procedure and a proposed test statistic based on a pseudo-marginal approach with Hamming distance performs better.,2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Moonsu Kang"", ids = ""2020907"")",,b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 002ea7f5cb5ad283292658e95788d15f657c587e; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 095696d2a79fa7912dd79dc381e0b70de34410ad; 30ee8cafc5ae740fe1b57c76632345cd39fe0162; 0514637086cd236781f72b717edbbc7115b2981b; 3473cbfa824aac9318602a66f6772862863a2b50; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 39be870fd89c32e31743fe0c03d68b3333bdbc95; bd104aab5b037418188ba4369f7e06df4a20de70; d34048b262f8427cdc8cbe206b36416a9e4d6fea; 023611ccb9018ab587e3f9a25b1a7d9a0831e657; 278f914ee2c9e0bfcdb96a5d0f6a6cd625b6a7bf,Communications for Statistical Applications and Methods,19,899-904
64a06c596db2a5df8c28e4139900822483bf80e6,DNA methylation changes in infants between 6 and 52 weeks,"Infants undergo extensive developments during their first year of life. Although the biological mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood, changes in the DNA methylation in mammals are believed to play a key role. This study was designed to investigate changes in infant DNA methylation that occurs between 6 and 52 weeks. A total of 214 infant saliva samples from 6 or 52 weeks were assessed using principal component analyses and t-distributed stochastic neighbor-embedding algorithms. Between the two time points, there were clear differences in DNA methylation. To further investigate these findings, paired two-sided studentâ€™s t-tests were performed. Differently methylated regions were defined as at least two consecutive probes that showed significant differences, with a q-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.01 and a mean differenceâ€‰>â€‰0.2. After correcting for false discovery rates, changes in the DNA methylation levels were found in 42 genes. Of these, 36 genes showed increased and six decreased DNA methylation. The overall DNA methylation changes indicated decreased gene expression. This was surprising because infants undergo such profound developments during their first year of life. The results were evaluated by taking into consideration the extensive development that occurs during pregnancy. During the first year of life, infants have an overall three-fold increase in weight, while the fetus develops from a single cell into a viable infant in 9 months, with an 875-million-fold increase in weight. It is possible that the findings represent a biological slowing mechanism in response to extensive fetal development. In conclusion, our study provides evidence of DNA methylation changes during the first year of life, representing a possible biological slowing mechanism. We encourage future studies of DNA methylation changes in infants to replicate the findings by using a repeated measures model and less stringent criteria to see if the same genes can be found, as well as investigating whether other genes are involved in development during this period.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ellen Wikenius"", ids = ""4590470""); list(name = ""Vibeke Moe"", ids = ""1381068239""); list(name = ""Lars Smith"", ids = ""2231850""); list(name = ""Einar R.

In the MARBLES prospective pregnancy study of high-risk younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), pregnancy and environmental factors collected by maternal interviews were examined as predictors of placental DNA methylation, including partially methylated domains (PMDs), an embryonic feature of the placental methylome. DNA methylation data from MethylC-seq analysis of 47 placentas of children clinically diagnosed at 3 years with ASD or typical development using standardized assessments were examined in relation to: child's gestational age, birth-weight, and diagnosis; maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, education, parity, height, prenatal vitamin and folate intake; home ownership; pesticides professionally applied to lawns or gardens or inside homes, pet flea/tick pouches, collars, or soaps/shampoos used in the 3 months prior to or during pregnancy. Sequencing run, order, and coverage, and child race and sex were considered as potential confounders. Akaike information criterion was used to select the most parsimonious among candidate models. Final prediction models used sandwich estimators to produce homoscadisticity-robust estimates of the 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-values controlled the false discovery rate at 5%. The strongest, most robust associations were between pesticides professionally applied outside the home and higher average methylation over PMDs [0.45 (95% CI 0.17, 0.72), P = 0.03] and a reduced proportion of the genome in PMDs [-0.42 (95% CI - 0.67 to -0.17), P = 0.03].

16f90d2b52eae1dc3a6c854554d68910cc4fb2be,A gene expression profile associated with relapse of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia is enriched for leukemia stem cell genes,"Some 50â€“80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) achieve a complete remission with contemporary chemotherapy protocols, yet the majority of them eventually relapse with resistant disease: some patients no longer respond to chemotherapy at disease recurrence; others accomplish second and even third remissions whose decreasing duration nevertheless indicates that the pool of residual leukemic cells, i.e. of cells that persisted during treatment with cytotoxic drugs, increases with every round of therapy [1]. Either of these clinical courses therefore reflects an enhanced chemotherapy resistance of leukemic cells at relapse as compared to the cell population at diagnosis. Molecular changes enabling malignant cells to survive exposure to cytotoxic drugs may already have been present in a subset of the leukemic cell population at presentation, or may emerge during treatment [2,3], but in any case are thought to be selected as a consequence of drug therapy, and to play a major role in therapy resistance at relapse. Remarkably, however, even though various types of molecular alterations may be acquired at relapse, neither specific cytogenetic alterations nor functionally relevant point mutations as identified by whole genome sequencing were associated with relapse in a recurrent manner [2,3]. Certain copy number variations and known AML associated point mutations were newly present at relapse in small proportions of patients (usually < 10%), but the latter were lost in other patients, indicating that they are unlikely to represent drivers of therapy resistance at disease recurrence [4]. These findings could either indicate that chemotherapy resistance at relapse is acquired through a large variety of different mechanisms, or that molecular changes of other types than those mentioned above are of more general relevance in this context. Indeed, an earlier study has suggested that the expression of specific genes may change in a consistent manner between diagnosis and relapse of AML [5]. However, only a limited number of genes and mostly unpaired samples were probed in this investigation. Therefore, in the present study, genes whose expression changed in a relapse-specific manner were sought in a set of paired AML samples and on a genome-wide scale. To limit the genetic heterogeneity of the study population, only samples from patients with cytogenetically normal (CN) AML were used. 
 
Clinical characteristics of 11 patients with CN AML from whom samples had been obtained at the time of diagnosis and of relapse are summarized in Supplementary Table I available online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2014.944523. Patients provided written informed consent prior to sample collection, and the reported studies were approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (EK 179/2011). Mononuclear cells were enriched through Ficoll gradient centrifugation, and RNA was extracted and hybridized to human ST1.1 microarrays (Affymetrix). Primary data analysis was performed using the Robust Multi-array Average algorithm. The levels of 4679 genes that displayed variable expression (i.e. an interquartile range of the log2 transformed data of > 0.65 across all samples) were compared between diagnosis and relapse samples using a paired moderated t-test (R-package limma), followed by multiple hypothesis correction according to Benjamini and Hochberg [6]. These analyses revealed that 536 unique genes were up- and 551 down-regulated at relapse at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 10% (Figure 1, Supplementary Table II available online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2014.944523).

Because relapse of AML is considered to result from the outgrowth of usually largely quiescent, chemotherapy resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs), a possible relationship between LSC and relapse-associated gene expression signatures was investigated. Gene expression profiles of LSC enriched versus LSC depleted human AML cell populations, functionally defined based on their engraftment ability in an optimized xenotransplant assay, were recently reported [7]. Of the 163 genes up-regulated in LSC enriched cell populations at an FDR < 10%, 19 were also up-regulated at relapse (p = 6.3 Ã— 10âˆ’ 7, odds ratio 4.29; Fisher's exact test). Similarly, 14 of the 41 genes down-regulated in LSCs were also down-regulated at relapse (p = 1.2 Ã— 10âˆ’ 11, odds ratio 16.36; Fisher's exact test), but no genes were regulated in an opposite manner in the two conditions (Supplementary Table II available online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2014.944523). 
 
To further explore relations between the relapse-associated gene expression profile and gene expression patterns associated with LSCs, as well as with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and with prognosis in AML, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [8] was performed. The 4679 genes whose expression had been compared between diagnosis and relapse of CN AML were ranked according to their associated t-statistic. The following gene lists were then probed against this relapse-associated gene expression profile: (i) genes up-regulated in functionally defined LSC enriched versus LSC depleted human AML cell populations [7]; (ii) genes up- or down-regulated in LSCs versus other leukemic cells as defined by the expression of cell surface markers [9]; (iii) genes up-regulated in HSCs versus progenitor and differentiated hematopoietic cells defined by specific cell surface markers [7]; and (iv) genes whose increased or decreased expression was associated with poor outcome in AML [10,11], or in the subgroup of CN AML [12]. Of note, the LSC and HSC signatures were related to each other [7], and, even though not defined on this basis, were able to predict chemotherapy responsiveness in AML [7,9]. All gene lists were used as reported, without any modifications. Where available, the corresponding lists of down-regulated genes were also probed, but in several cases these were either not reported, or too short to be useful for GSEA. In agreement with relapse representing a chemotherapy resistant state, the functionally defined LSC signature [7] and the HSC signature [7], as well as the three gene expression signatures linked to poor outcome in AML [10â€“12], were significantly enriched in the relapse-associated gene expression profile (Figure 2). Conversely, the list of genes down-regulated in patients with poor response to chemotherapy [10] was significantly negatively enriched in the relapse profile (while only small numbers of genes were down-regulated in poor responders in [11,12]), as was the list of genes down-regulated in surface-marker defined LSCs [9] (Figure 2).

The data presented in this report show that, in contrast to other investigated molecular alterations, changes in the expression of specific genes are associated with relapse of CN AML in a recurrent and significant manner. Corroborating the assumption that these changes indeed reflect, and possibly contribute to, a state of increased therapy resistance, the relapse-associated gene expression profile was enriched for gene signatures connected to poor outcome. Furthermore, a significant enrichment for gene expression signatures associated with LSCs was observed, thereby supporting the concept that relapse of AML results from the outgrowth of chemotherapy resistant LSCs and is associated with increased â€œstemness.â€ At the intersection of the relapse and the LSC signatures, a number of genes with potential roles in chemotherapy resistance were uncovered. For example, the gene coding for integrin Î±6, ITGA6, was expressed at elevated levels at relapse and in LSCs (Supplementary Table II available online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2014.944523). It was also up-regulated in AML cells with high levels of EVI1, which itself is a harbinger of a poor prognosis, and contributed to their therapy resistance [13]. Similarly, targeted deletion of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), which was down-regulated both at relapse of CN AML and in LSCs (Supplementary Table II available online at http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10428194.2014.944523), increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis of myeloid cells in vitro, and promoted leukemogenesis in a mouse model [14]. In metastatic colon cancer cell lines, its methylation mediated down-regulation also contributed to apoptosis resistance [15]. Functional analyses of these and other genes at the intersections of LSCs, chemotherapy resistance, and relapse can be expected to yield novel insights into the biology of AML, and may lead to the discovery of novel targets for rationally designed therapies.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hubert Hackl"", ids = ""2128466""); list(name = ""Katarina Steinleitner"", ids = ""6629915""); list(name = ""Karin Lind"", ids = ""145815785""); list(name = ""Sybille Hofer"", ids = ""5433139""); list(name = ""Natasa Tosic"", ids = ""5419712""); list(name = ""Sonja Pavlovic"", ids = ""145030535""); list(name = ""Nada SuvajdÅ¾iÄ‡"", ids = ""6961114""); list(name = ""Heinz Sill"", ids = ""144225997""); list(name = ""Rotraud Wieser"", ids = ""3280393"")",1bf642fe2fd9d8aefde2684f30508532aa258ab7; cf59a31e275a1d0ebe5875286a0522d48b3ad8f1; e692ce05fa98719e2a143027beabd2023de4c2d5; 436aa8376249284891b08ab0b49a024790529dfe; 691908b6d1eeedcf1f350adcc672e62dbd018908; f8bc393858c46a39c7de3317bc99b6a05cd99b83; b75ba1408c05651dd8f7b7bb7f0da252ce3858f1; f6643a0a4596b34c80bdcef7224d9fc56007fc33; 1619ccd44ba8f491231378958d5c553589399cf6,ea68c4aa30767b16502bb4d820da137b04c70e53; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 62025ea4e17173f24a036bf51010a26e21ebd6b4; 06305d2a39b67db476d381b72746ebe5526a22f8; f38473fcf1a2afb89a8184b0de053c5470948737; 1aa693f476ed6fc865f35d9dc673a7ba6927a2e2; d6e2993a8c7eec16a063e91235989b6409f07b4d; 6fc25baae359b11380356d88363f36daa3813114; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bc048679769f76f2bb3d3d147821b9f47d82268b,Leukemia & Lymphoma,56,1126 - 1128

c7bb70a969a8421acfa4d306c84644749ebaf81c,Tissue-specific transcriptome responses in rats with early streptozotocin-induced diabetes.,"The understanding of common and tissue-specific molecular alterations in diabetes, particularly at early stages, is limited and fragmental. In the present study, we systematically compared transcriptome responses in four important diabetic target tissues in rats with 2 wk of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. At this stage of diabetes, the skeletal muscle exhibited the highest transcriptome sensitivity to the STZ treatment with nearly 17% of the transcriptome being altered (false discovery rate, 1.6%) compared with approximately 3% in the cardiac left ventricle, renal cortex, and retina. Similarity in transcriptome response among tissues was low, with the highest similarity being 2.2% between skeletal muscle and the left ventricle. Several biological processes or cellular components, such as lipid metabolism in the left ventricle and collagen in the renal cortex, were significantly overrepresented in the responsive genes than in the entire array. Particularly interesting cases of common or tissue-specific regulation included decorin and CD36, which were upregulated in several tissues, and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase and four and a half LIM domains 2, which were upregulated only in the renal cortex. Further biochemical analyses indicated that the thiol and oxidative stress pathway was altered in a tissue-specific manner at several levels including transcript abundance, content of reduced thiols, and lipid peroxidation, providing an example of the potential biological relevance of tissue-specific transcript regulation.

798afe6fcf7161b4f8973d8ec162fa3301f4e274,An environmental wide association study (EWAS) approach to the metabolic syndrome.,"BACKGROUND
Environmental contaminants have previously been linked to components of the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). However, exposure to environmental contaminants is in part determined by various lifestyle factors.


OBJECTIVE
Using an ""Environmental Wide Association Study"" (ELWAS) integrating environmental contaminants and lifestyle factors, we aimed to evaluate a possible additive role of both contaminants and lifestyle factors regarding MetS.


METHODS
1016 subjects aged 70years were investigated in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study. 43 environmental contaminants were measured in the circulation. Dietary records were used to evaluate 21 nutrients and the proportions of 13 fatty acids were determined in serum cholesterol esters to further quantify fat quality intake. Adding 5 other important lifestyle factors yielded together 76 environmental and lifestyle factors. MetS was defined by the NCEP/ATPIII-criteria.


RESULTS
23% had MetS. Using cross-validation within the sample, fourteen environmental contaminants or lifestyle factors consistently showed a false discovery rate <0.05. When the major variables entered a multiple model, only p, p'-DDE levels (positive), PCB209 (inverse) and exercise habits (inverse) were together with a fatty acid pattern, with high levels of palmitic acid and oleic acid and low levels of linoleic acid, related to MetS (p<0.002 for all variables).


CONCLUSION
Using a cross-sectional EWAS approach, certain environmental contaminants and lifestyle factors were found to be associated with prevalent metabolic syndrome in an additive fashion in an elderly population.",2013,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""P Monica Lind"", ids = ""144556546""); list(name = ""Ulf RisÃ©rus"", ids = ""4777619""); list(name = ""Samira Salihovic"", ids = ""5012002""); list(name = ""Bert van Bavel"", ids = ""3618166""); list(name = ""Lars Lind"", ids = ""2813823"")",ffe767956f0fa808e3913110c7034c3cefe19e22; 26b2a185c68f55e90720276dda5337cae3953b09; 2bc5fb0bf05117855c8ea6d9a1d69d37c4669a44; ecceca5510acc4723558b12fd7d49fb0cdd71e99; a2be5b2c7cd14ea231378bbb227c3d8b92107456; 73875e23a4f698a9dacace48bdf0a82edf3ec10c; 1b3506f79a03686a8a6ce969e5da4967384c547e; a21b6ac09730a1f9eca6f4b8bbbed5c75c876911; 5a7a94656bc41df881029b62eac2aa8358b456d2; 385c1af2c023178734fbac371f384e2b8695b710; 9d44ef1c27a2b6c062a1aef001061a3912653db6; bd67831ab2ceac3a9f81a5374ac4a004b8eaad1c; 9c44424104f9fc0c2fcbe418c9baee26c9bc5fb7; ea68dd23581625aae66320cc07be71334a934e96; 0420f997f360abb23ef919e791fb92f07e7f51fc; 2b105df4c0e2957c336597b0b6e16bf8dbf67721; 2353a3c0b58ea8670faf37a4fe95c5800fd14cb6; f184f0277a9c4a2f66f94614b396481ab60aa06d; 7700731795e33a2374a9f5ae2db9b4156072f77c; c100c604169af967e953807220f1914d971b8b38; 37fda3e2c958df954e0cfef48664e4e5baa56068; 023f0e0a101f5fb890fa0e785a6e50de48ee56ce; 76ae96acfe13ff86f5cbc2cbb855acaab61cabc8; d0e9784d5c151f103c49e573d47043f3437ecd2d; e0aac4d1cbd9e7a293298226091494b9d8933f26; 952af9a1f2f766fa40bd1541cee423206d206801; d9fdd4f3a8296778c7396423c6515bf6762e8811; f66a5497e81844586d1f85ee0770f71abc8168bc; bcd68c9d29031b27e7a8b60e6f62f9c24be4a88a,c6d1baff006f163da82bc76a70c82a97c6c8095e; 4f830f55abc04c1ef832ec9f90f19f0425f71fd9; 5bd1a04fe03b13b4a0ea362ef4739eebcaf437ff; c578f14384a7668f0f75cac9708845e041ffae90; 1e277d9fe56e2b6c4a36ed9f68bac5b9bbe12488; b07b4bfa967d8838b70168017e242fb8dc09b3b3; 501a129c5de2e56f85901ff46ff9de02a9402821; 7d9797cd800330f916342ccf4e62bb72029ab91c; 9f062969480863d8c1addf7c03b70fe71efbd231; 020f84d69cbca41e490db8fdbf25ef120d69ed0b; bfd393596180b56f3192b2ebd346925dc5c2c5ac; e78d9db416ec1f7eeca43745862db44b0b126b47; 4c532d7eb158f1049ef361e5215c1495f321a03a; 1b44d80637e12eb0473596d6359664c56c1fe6c6; 35ab53e92179e1dafb206916222d623bd0fe3d3d; 37b1be6d7231abc41547d5ff6df4f1a6da7565ea; ef3b8168a47fa4c1c4ce5b2a7382e90b0430f458; f6fc73da141325113c95e29e05b9be7872dbbe18; b936c444b04c3f608bdab1b86b18cefd37d91f31; 80fe5d7452bb2dd8f613e7cbeedb753d086b9f83; 79eee789f36b939a844e8555994bae648e55215a; 1599df8ab6d76617a738c6efeeb243e265a3cb64; 028d7655f29d788c70872d42e9d6346e97ece05d; 81e14d2987f4c2a0cea63e7318fce2fe21aeef26; 1cee31d30cf1048310e38c48b45785123af197f0; 62adbe844d015f06673ceac7b3aad0ee1f3b0326; b31ef39501c3c6680e53d4fea325c6aa0afcfd73; 47f525f29eb9c9702bb64c177b00c595177f69ad; 35aa2ee73a6ac31e05257c2ddf96eed7c9dd6dbd; ad09b1119b29a67bb14397c91987de9057b5f691; b822d882c5a1aebdc65a2fb60b5826880a91a16d; e0baf8468b1e7428fbcb948736fe2f8114829df7; d3943a26be528cab1bf3b4c46b860a7a1f156173; fefdf456d5a3f67a4027a78df9aff8194ff8e45a; b43409e9f70746fbaf34db496ef645c43ce5ddcb; 088e39784520e587f4c08dc928895e95e379eaf1; 0373f18622b7b64e99c7e56340ab2011dbd00b5d; fd527901f3558adf75f05101035afa53cdea8b90; 9347accbc146b52890536afe684be0feb533cf9c; 840604c43a578daffe31dd19ac0c986d731c2ff8; d63c08e7ed9eedc0c68f454bba8e41af6bbebd21; 91edb97fecbebdd5c29436cc25004bea04618282; 4e60905e6c729100f81c0309e7a9795b1fbf1ab4; ba7684a2a2b46a1ed9fc5bc0d18bda2de4eb455e,Environment international,55,"

76bdec6d356eeb531f66935f2ff226b8b171d498,Evaluation of changes in serum protein profiles during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer using an LC-MALDI-TOF/MS procedure.,"Comparison of protein profiles of sera acquired before and after preoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer may reveal tumor markers that could be used to monitor tumor response. In this study, we analyzed pre- and post-chemotherapy protein profiles of sera from 39 HER2-postive breast cancer patients (n=78 samples) who received 6 months of preoperative chemotherapy using LC-MALDI-TOF/MS technology. We detected qualitative and quantitative differences in pair-wise comparison of pre- and post chemotherapy samples that were different in patients who achieved pathological complete response (pCR, n=21) compared with those with residual disease (n=18). We identified 2329 and 3152 peaks as differentially expressed in the pre-chemotherapy samples of the responders and non-responders. Comparison of matching pre- and post-chemotherapy samples identified 34 (32 decreased, two increased) and 304 peaks (157 decreased, 147 increased) that significantly changed (p<0.01, false discovery rate â‰¤ 20%) after treatment in responders and non-responders, respectively. The top 11 most significantly altered peptide peaks with the greatest change in intensity were positively identified. These corresponded to eight proteins including Î±-2-macroglobulin, complement 3, hemopexin, and serum amyloid P in the responder group and chains C and A of apolipoprotein A-I, hemopexin precursor, complement C, and amyloid P component in the non-responding groups. All proteins decreased after therapy, except chain C apolipoprotein A and hemopexin precursor that increased. These results suggest that changes in serum protein levels occur in response to chemotherapy and these changes partly appear different in patients who are highly sensitive to chemotherapy compared with those with lesser response.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chafika Mazouni"", ids = ""4571856""); list(name = ""Keith A.

283d3de6e4552560dc1f3b963ada749d2ac7dc4c,Improved Ranking Functions for Protein and Modification-Site Identifications,"There are a number of computational tools for assigning identifications to peptide tandem mass spectra, but only a few tools, most notably ProteinProphet, for the crucial next step of integrating peptide identifications into higher-level identifications, such as proteins or modification sites. Here we describe a new program called ComByne for scoring and ranking higher-level identifications. Unlike other identification integration tools, ComByne corrects for protein lengths; it also makes use of more information, such as retention times and spectrum-to-spectrum corroborations. We compare ComByne to existing algorithms on several complex biological samples, including a sample of mouse blood plasma spiked with known concentrations of human proteins.

440d60685950e80616b1c968b73dc2728bed9833,Identification of differentially expressed gene categories in microarray studies using nonparametric multivariate analysis,"MOTIVATION
The field of microarray data analysis is shifting emphasis from methods for identifying differentially expressed genes to methods for identifying differentially expressed gene categories. The latter approaches utilize a priori information about genes to group genes into categories and enhance the interpretation of experiments aimed at identifying expression differences across treatments. While almost all of the existing approaches for identifying differentially expressed gene categories are practically useful, they suffer from a variety of drawbacks. Perhaps most notably, many popular tools are based exclusively on gene-specific statistics that cannot detect many types of multivariate expression change.


RESULTS
We have developed a nonparametric multivariate method for identifying gene categories whose multivariate expression distribution differs across two or more conditions. We illustrate our approach and compare its performance to several existing procedures via the analysis of a real data set and a unique data-based simulation study designed to capture the challenges and complexities of practical data analysis. We show that our method has good power for differentiating between differentially expressed and non-differentially expressed gene categories, and we utilize a resampling based strategy for controlling the false discovery rate when testing multiple categories.

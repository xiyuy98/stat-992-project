607f4cded8dd765a1be9a0af8a766479ca298e62,LISA improves statistical analysis for fMRI,"One of the principal goals in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the detection of local activation in the human brain. However, lack of statistical power and inflated false positive rates have recently been identified as major problems in this regard. Here, we propose a non-parametric and threshold-free framework called LISA to address this demand. It uses a non-linear filter for incorporating spatial context without sacrificing spatial precision. Multiple comparison correction is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate in the filtered maps. Compared to widely used other methods, it shows a boost in statistical power and allows to find small activation areas that have previously evaded detection. The spatial sensitivity of LISA makes it especially suitable for the analysis of high-resolution fMRI data acquired at ultrahigh field (â‰¥7â€‰Tesla).Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful technique for measuring human brain activity, but the statistical analysis of fMRI data can be difficult. Here, the authors introduce a new fMRI analysis tool, LISA, which provides increased statistical power compared to existing techniques.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriele Lohmann"", ids = ""36071906""); list(name = ""Johannes Stelzer"", ids = ""39414196""); list(name = ""Eric Lacosse"", ids = ""51388669""); list(name = ""Vinod Kumar"", ids = ""153730348""); list(name = ""Karsten MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""153553613""); list(name = ""Esther Kuehn"", ids = ""47299664""); list(name = ""Wolfgang Grodd"", ids = ""1763712""); list(name = ""Klaus Scheffler"", ids = ""2574071"")",455a66bee43c65e66da3770f8ae6024266e81e96; 5fc8d61512318e743f2eb455962dc2f38df6d6d0; 1422b1f0fa6d87bc63163ce168f554ae1422abab; 2211b27e8b8a3ad5b63542fdcfa9421e63e99f09; c58cdd0c060bc92aa485f03f5949cebe12095b7a; 121e58f06f165fe5c0bd70e334dde477d4931d2e,2cc6ae2a6783714444a448f87a55d4ea137099bf; fc264e230970f3eed9d17a3def70863526b0b1bc; 558e9b8b9b802b094562d01e4189f820b7681196; e4e4d3fb2bdc62e3a09060253d37f8bcbf346689; 945aa9eb1ea80ad8684fbd8eddf174056493162c; 868af9c158d6fbda983e6a1b5a4e137aa7d6c39c; d67132304ca462c6675228b494442123a0157451; 864af1c01decf87a9481984c0cbe240ee52dd7f8; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; 7e8f728c62b49afeb5b4b17c94d9991c671a1d36; f992441dc6f19a885d5cf57184ee7a8a1ce317f5; e7b85db89d5f2311b2e53dcac457cd8d27d20a83; 87c3309529a96c5f6eeab22e99bc59916b034ad7; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; b6a958ec026b1e038a9d10cfcb27f299474217f2; 07b489fe3b9a5c74bcb6f98d7d689692fd36ffee; 678477cb06eefcecf1d9551e175c1b849fdce3f9; dd98484c9a7d70b3641ba55244e417c6d63ed372; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 93bc678116f0a062de7f694e0552f56df924d08f; bd8553f21abfb726fc87b483133b34579bbb3755; a97c78fc9c13c86050f418b91bb507dac988bb92; 493fb60f449846b4b6a38fb951e989d75dc64593; 5ae4bb66988ac383c4f84060ceeef9a9228fa4d9; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; 76fa9d010a94151202b0aa7ee3cfdc76065711f4; 85fb198635415207241fafc25fe90c011f18e1c3; 5abd8b5de9d39fca26289ae7d6e53e651f2dfe3d; 010f6c47ae78dbf7e9844688a264f0face1f897c; 81187f4cef8b5201f4614c60e9b7734b5165e2f7; 3b25c7f9ab70751d5dfffbd02001a2a9fb5a2215; 84daa480574830fc84ad6c68cade99bf1ea427fd; 5393d7af75d80410fcecacbdb23c0c10d4d0b03c; 1614a87a2d00ae9b081b55f9242204535fdcff14; 7c6d2e910563abd092fd147352d1785f2d75b6cf; 3ace3864cc5ada47b31a74d8fea91edb48bc019d; 496c3d75b81b336411e53da1ac632a8139655604; ee3f510b6446416e02045038025156d7534b7534; d9429f3ae8d04b0e0f357ada8389e066d664c294; 64187b77fa1d67dd2d5596f731b2c6dab98d3b55; 1d3e6261afe07b1238cda92da86af666f748e767; 0666fc123f3da6cf61b2550b8246c9bc8093b5fe; 728391eff09450f4fe425e7f2c8ae7a7cac70ccb; f7761d3376749d66fb5eec1bcdfbcc8541548b5e; 84e65f93d484c746dee4486035387b329681235a; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; c2bc880156c10fc8d1752cd3d528e4ef96cbaac4; ee7f867739a0d638997bb0f63b6ad18a38bd5be7; 34b80a764bdf9a8112105df714176507a5f95da5; aef90e0ac203322bc18c4b88fcddc0e12ba5c080; df875280431169e26c9463c95c0aa6f12548076b; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; fe57732eaf3f757c221937b5e9bcda93d76d5d6f; bfeaf424a2ea6ca4702d545c6e959e2caeb68e9b; fee78005a74d7da336f1979f10ed16b0f8042482; 64fa38f0f3fd2f50eeb387b5f918f8842d2ffe89; c83cb156e8812906bf79337032e076f734eb5d80; 72857b712b39c41eac6438f776d6a98a0a29bfd9; bacea87f378678a6499f9983d94f285c54ac394f; f4de8b77837860284f90f0a416a30469b0a63bb4; 8b3158e0fcd52eb2131194f41f6f64980bb69bbc; 989ebce06d43a695a1de6b704f6ecdc00097f979; 3a891df6349236ace22780bec4951a88af785fdf; 44202b5d1fee91c0cb896e11f7b2bb2e4d22f238; ed008d2c0ec14a9f184d89ff95b96233c5ef2ff9; 7072ef929fa3d7c3177ca868309523c588a67bd1; b41f221cf10ae30f6abed57347ed2884b5c88804; aa592f0dca2a00f7c66bf657818f0779a733691b; 70e7c81228cce638c7f170b1e830123041f91170; 133c558e3d38813b9bd03242682a3c4a6f6e0d66; 8e61f76f24db2d7539075f319c2fe85bf36bb22c; a2404efe53398d7900830f1c25bdecf42bf1002e; 53db89dcf41da17c6fd6c63cde121b96f85c65a2,Nature Communications,9,
be9c93a407e884599b6f5dfdcf035c85a447f052,"Germline polymorphisms discovered via a cell-based, genome-wide approach predict platinum response in head and neck cancers.","Identifying patients prior to treatment who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapeutic agents or more likely to experience adverse events is an aim of personalized medicine. Pharmacogenomics offers a potential means of achieving this goal through the discovery of predictive germline genetic biomarkers. When applied particularly to the treatment of head and neck cancers, such information could offer significant benefit to patients as a means of potentially reducing morbidity associated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We developed a genome-wide, cell-based approach to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with platinum susceptibility and then evaluated these SNPs as predictors for response and toxicity in head and neck cancer patients treated with platinum-based therapy as part of a phase II clinical trial. Sixty head and neck cancer patients were evaluated. Of 45 genome-wide SNPs examined, we found that 2 SNPs, rs6870861 (P=0.004; false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) and rs2551038 (P=0.005; FDR <0.05), were associated significantly with overall response to carboplatin-based induction chemotherapy when incorporated into a model along with total carboplatin exposure. Interestingly, these 2 SNPs are associated strongly with the baseline expression of >20 genes (all P â‰¤10(-4)), and that 2 genes (SLC22A5 and SLCO4C1) are important organic cation/anion transporters known to affect platinum uptake and clearance. Several other SNPs were associated nominally with carboplatin-related hematologic toxicities. These findings demonstrate importantly that a genome-wide, cell-based model can identify novel germline genetic biomarkers of platinum susceptibility, which are replicable in a clinical setting with treated cancer patients and seem clinically meaningful for potentially enabling future personalization of care in such patients.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dana Ziliak"", ids = ""4717350""); list(name = ""Peter H.

66c521758549aa398720e478da755436748402a6,Inflammatory Gene Haplotype-Interaction Networks Involved in Coronary Collateral Formation,"Objectives: Formation of collateral circulation is an endogenous response to atherosclerosis, and is a natural escape mechanism by re-routing blood. Inflammatory response- related genes underlie the formation of coronary collaterals. We explored the genetic basis of collateral formation in man postulating interaction networks between functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in these inflammatory gene candidates. Methods: The contribution of 41 genes as well as the interactions among them was examined in a cohort of 226 coronary artery disease patients, genotyped for 54 candidate SNPs. Patients were classified to the extent of collateral circulation. Stepwise logistic regression analysis and a haplotype entropy procedure were applied to search for haplotype interactions among all 54 polymorphisms. Multiple testing was addressed by using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Results: The population comprised 84 patients with and 142 without visible collaterals. Among the 41 genes, 16 pairs of SNPs were implicated in the development of collaterals with the FDR of 0.19. Nine SNPs were found to potentially have main effects on collateral formation. Two sets of coupling haplotypes that predispose to collateral formation were suggested. Conclusions: These findings suggest that collateral formation may arise from the interactions between several SNPs in inflammatory response related genes, which may represent targets in future studies of collateral formation. This may enhance developing strategies for risk stratification and therapeutic stimulation of arteriogenesis.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jian Zhang"", ids = ""49050952""); list(name = ""Jakub J.

17613b62bf89f6568c02a46f2432e5b4c8c2187b,Sex differences in gene expression in the human fetal brain,"Widespread structural, chemical and molecular differences have been reported between the male and female human brain. Although several neurodevelopmental disorders are more commonly diagnosed in males, little is known regarding sex differences in early human brain development. Here, we used RNA sequencing data from a large collection of human brain samples from the second trimester of gestation (N = 120) to assess sex biases in gene expression within the human fetal brain. In addition to 43 genes (102 Ensembl transcripts) transcribed from the Y-chromosome in males, we detected sex differences in the expression of 2558 autosomal genes (2723 Ensembl transcripts) and 155 genes on the X-chromosome (207 Ensembl transcripts) at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1. Genes exhibiting sex-biased expression in human fetal brain are enriched for high-confidence risk genes for autism and other developmental disorders. Male-biased genes are enriched for expression in neural progenitor cells, whereas female-biased genes are enriched for expression in Cajal-Retzius cells and glia.

4baa1eabb68abbb016093062f2b630d08c5bfb09,Comparative bioinformatical analysis of pancreatic head cancer and pancreatic body/tail cancer,"This study is to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and mutation signatures of pancreatic head cancer and pancreatic body/tail cancer. Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD) RNA-seq data, mutation data and clinical data were downloaded and collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), FireHose and CBioPortal. According to the anatomic location, the patients were divided into 146 cases of pancreatic head cancer and 28 cases of pancreatic body/tail cancer. Then survival analysis was performed by Kaplanâ€“Meier and log-rank test. Furthermore, DEGs were screened by R package Deseq2. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and proteinâ€“protein interaction (PPI) were then carried out by DAVID and String. Online tool TIMER was used to analyze the immune cells infiltration. R package maftools and GenVisR were applied to analyze frequently mutated genes and mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) of PAAD. Survival of patients with pancreatic body/tail cancer was better than those with pancreatic head cancer (median survival, 24.05 vs 19.45 months, pâ€‰=â€‰0.048). And 496 significant DEGs (|log2 FoldChange| > 1.5,false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05) were identified, including 253 downregulated genes and 243 upregulated genes. And there were 13 Go terms (4 biological processes, 6 cellular components and 3 molecular functions) and 3 KEGG pathways (Pancreatic secretion, Fat digestion and absorption, Protein digestion and absorption) (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). B cells and CD4â€‰+â€‰T cells infiltration were more significant in pancreatic head cancer. MATH scores of pancreatic body/tail cancer were higher than pancreatic head cancer, while Ï‡2 test of top 10 frequently mutated genes showed little difference between them. There were prognostic and genetic differences between pancreatic head cancer and pancreatic body/tail cancer.

099411ec6f07682abfb532b23acca227e70bc747,Identification of physicians with unusual performance in screening colonoscopy databases: a Bayesian approach.,"BACKGROUND
The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is an important surrogate measure of performance quality for screening colonoscopies.


OBJECTIVE
To demonstrate how physicians with unusual performance concerning the adenoma detection rate may be identified in screening colonoscopy databases.


DESIGN
Bayesian random-effects modeling and Winsorization of potential outliers were applied to develop a robust model for the majority of providers. Divergence was assessed with adjustment for multiple testing. The steps in the analysis were visualized by using funnel plots. Additionally, minimum requirements for the number of colonoscopies with 1 or more detected adenomas were derived.


SETTING
Data from 422 physicians offering screening colonoscopy and participating in a quality assurance program in Bavaria, Germany, were used.


PATIENTS
A total of 69,738 asymptomatic individuals 55 to 79 years of age.


INTERVENTION
Screening colonoscopy.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS
Physician-specific ADRs.


RESULTS
The overall ADR in the sample was 26%. From an initial model, 62 physicians (15%) were identified asÂ potential outliers. A model with normally distributed random effects was then chosen as the robust null model. Of the potential outliers, 10 (16%) were confirmed as physicians with unusual performance at a false discovery rate of 5%. For all of them, the observed ADR was lower than expected, and together they accounted for 1.4% of all included colonoscopies.


LIMITATIONS
Analysis of routine data.


CONCLUSION
The applied statistical approach appears suitable to identify unusual performance in screening colonoscopy databases. Its application may help to evaluate and improve the quality of colonoscopy in population-based colorectal cancer screening programs.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christian Stock"", ids = ""145201251""); list(name = ""Lorenz Uhlmann"", ids = ""2213770""); list(name = ""Michael Hoffmeister"", ids = ""2727458""); list(name = ""Gunter Laux"", ids = ""14714229""); list(name = ""Meinhard Kieser"", ids = ""2093634""); list(name = ""Hermann Brenner"", ids = ""143862076"")",b12f313e8192955eafb63e84364b52402ba6cbaa; 06f0ec50462b9fc24a1476d035f12a6c1357cd6a; 98d86a5bc1089123a6e691ead37578c17a24fac0,,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,81 3,"

1084d4f8f82ab170f937dde4eaac040bf271fcdc,Treatment with the MEK inhibitor U 0126 induces increased lactate production in prostate and breast cancer cell lines,"Introduction. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways control fundamental cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and are often deregulated in cancer. Among the MAPK pathways, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is of particular relevance as it is deregulated in approximately one-third of all human cancer and targeted inhibitors are being developed as cancer therapeutics. U0126 is a highly selective inhibitor of the ERK-activating MEK1/2. In this study we investigated the metabolic consequences of U0126 treatment in human prostate and breast cancer cell lines using H and C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as well as gene expression data. Methods. Prostate (PC3 and LNCaP) and breast (MCF7) human cancer cells were treated for 48 hrs with U0126. Cells were extracted using a dual phase extraction and the dried polar extracts were redissolved in 90% H2O/10% D2O phosphate buffer. H MR data were acquired at 600 MHz using a 90Â° pulse and 4 s relaxation delay and the water signal was suppressed using excitation sculpting. Repeated univariate statistical testing with false discovery rate correction was performed on each point of the H MR spectra to determine significant signal changes. The rate of glucose uptake and lactate production were determined from dynamic studies in live cells grown on beads by using C MRS to acquire sequential 2 hour proton-decoupled C spectra (60Â° pulse and 6 s relaxation delay) over 15-22 h while the cells were perfused with medium containing 1-C glucose as described (1). Protein and gene expression levels were measured using Western blotting and microarray analysis as described (1). Results and Discussion. The effect of U0126 was confirmed by western blot analysis demonstrating a drop in p-ERK (Fig. 1). H MRS spectra were recorded for all cell lines. The univariate statistical analysis (Fig. 2a) performed on the data of the prostate cells revealed that the 48 hour drug treatment induced several significant metabolic changes, including depletion of intracellular aspartate, succinate and phosphocholine. In addition, surprisingly, in all three cell lines a substantial increase in intracellular lactate levels was observed following treatment, with lactate up 134Â±16% (p=0.002), 149Â±20% (p=0.001) and 213Â±43% (n=2) of control in PC3, LNCaP and MCF7 cells, respectively. Dynamic studies in live MCF7 cells were in line with the extract data and showed that the rate of lactate production increased following treatment 169Â±43% from 260Â±98 fmol/cell/hour to 439Â±114 fmol/cell/hour (p=0.027; Fig 2b and c). The rate of glucose uptake increased 140Â±40% but did not reach significance (p=0.18). Dynamic studies are underway for prostate cells with initial findings in line with the MCF7 data. Consistent with the metabolic observations, overexpression of several genes associated with glycolysis, including 6phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK1), hexokinase 2 (HK2) and glucose transporters (GLUT1) were observed in PC3 cells pointing to an increase in glycolytic enzymes induced by the U0126 treatment. In an effort to explain this observation we assessed the expression of other signaling proteins and found that, although U0126 inhibits its target kinase, cross-talk between the MAPK and the PI3K pathways triggers increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig 1). The activation of Akt following MAPK inhibition has been previously observed (2,3). Moreover, Akt activation has been previously observed to modulate glycolysis (4). We therefore hypothesize that the observed increases in lactate production and its intracellular accumulation following inhibition of MAPK kinase Fig. 1.

8c43d39489e0cba1e4384bbcede7df405acc1597,Viral community predicts the geographical origin of fermented vegetable foods more precisely than bacterial community.,"Fermented foods are considered as an integral part of the global human diet. Fermented foods also have unique microbial communities such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses that are essential to the fermentation process and affect final product characteristics. Despite the ecological importance of virus, little is known about the diversity and ecological role of virus in the food ecosystem. In this study, the viral and host bacterial communities from 10 representative samples of Korean and Chinese kimchi were analyzed in triplicate using next-generation sequencing technology. The overall structures of bacterial and viral communities were dominated by lactic acid bacteria in phylum Firmicutes and bacteriophages in order Caudovirales, respectively. For the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses, bacteriophage in family Microviridae were dominant in Korean kimchi. After correction for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05), the relative abundances of 6 bacterial taxa and 33 viral host taxa at the genus level were significantly different between Korean and Chinese kimchi. Notably, in beta-diversity analysis, viral communities were much more clearly separated according to their geographical origin (PERMANOVA pseudo-Fâ€¯=â€¯11.57, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001 in Bray-Curtis PCoA) than bacterial communities (pseudo-Fâ€¯=â€¯4.75, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001 in unweighted UniFrac PCoA). Thus, viral metagenomics represents a potentially useful in-depth analytical method for determining the geographical origins of fermented foods.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mi-Ja Jung"", ids = ""80359801""); list(name = ""Minsoo Kim"", ids = ""51030781""); list(name = ""Ji-Hyun Yun"", ids = ""5103695""); list(name = ""Juneyoung Lee"", ids = ""49685002""); list(name = ""Pil Soo Kim"", ids = ""5713308""); list(name = ""Haewon Lee"", ids = ""153797356""); list(name = ""Ji-Hyoung Ha"", ids = ""8515245""); list(name = ""Seong Woon Roh"", ids = ""4614786""); list(name = ""Jin-Woo Bae"", ids = ""2120365"")",9c18bcec37069db0796bb9995b673550bdf2a5c4,,Food microbiology,76,"

We propose a new way to calibrate both Type I and Type II errors. We start with the researcher's prior belief on the proportion of managers that are skilled. Using a double bootstrap method, we then establish a t-statistic hurdle that is associated with a specific false discovery rate (e.g., 5%). We also establish a t-statistic hurdle that is associated with a certain acceptable ratio of misses to false discoveries (Type II error scaled by Type I error) | effectively allowing for differential costs of the two types of mistakes.

ec98165275c904bdc6e009afece8613ffda32e91,Prenatal mercury concentration is associated with changes in DNA methylation at TCEANC2 in newborns.,"BACKGROUND
Human exposure to the widespread environmental contaminant mercury is a known risk factor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders through poorly characterized mechanisms. Evidence suggests mercury exposure may alter DNA methylation levels, but to date, the effects in early life on a genome-wide scale have not been investigated.


METHODS
A study sample of 141 newborns was recruited in Baltimore, MD, USA and total mercury and methylmercury were measured in cord blood samples. We quantified genome-wide DNA methylation data using CHARM 2.0, an array-based method, and used region-finding analyses to identify concentration-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs). To test for replication of these identified DMRs in the pilot, or Vanguard, phase of the National Children's Study (NCS), we compared bisulfite-pyrosequenced DNA at candidate regions from 85 whole cord blood samples with matched first trimester maternal mercury concentration measures.


RESULTS
Total mercury concentration was associated with methylation at DMRs inside ANGPT2 and near PRPF18 genes [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05], as well as DMRs near FOXD2 and within TCEANC2 (FDR< 0.1) genes. Methylmercury concentration was associated with an overlapping DMR within TCEANC2 (FDR< 0.05). In NCS replication analyses, methylation levels at three of four cytosine-guanine DNA dinucleotides (CpG sites) within the TCEANC2 DMR were associated with total mercury concentration (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and this association was diminished after adjusting for estimated cell proportions.

57998076487e8eac30eff607127a4b53d021ab06,Genetic determinants of mycophenolate-related anemia and leukopenia after transplantation.,"BACKGROUND
Mycophenolate-related anemia and leukopenia are well-known toxicities after transplantation. Toxicity leads to dose reduction, addition of colony-stimulating factors or erythropoietin, or discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. The causes of and risk factors associated with toxicity are unclear.


METHODS
We studied the association between mycophenolate-related anemia and leukopenia and 2724 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 978 patients undergoing living or deceased donor kidney transplant. Patients were followed up to time of first anemia (hemoglobin<10 gm/dL or hematocrit<30%) or first leukopenia (white blood cell [WBC] count <3000 cells/mm), which required clinical intervention in the first 6 months after transplant.


RESULTS
Anemia occurred in 87 (9.5%) subjects and leukopenia in 224 (22.9%). In single SNP analyses, none of the SNPs were associated with time to leukopenia at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 20%. However, SNPs from the IL12A, HUS, CYP2C8 genes were associated with time to anemia, allowing for an FDR of 20%. To assess the independence of these SNPs as predictors of anemia, we conducted a multi-SNP analysis including one SNP from each of the three genes. All three SNPs were associated with time to anemia, after adjusting for recipient age, weight, posttransplant dialysis and antiviral drug use, and stratifying by clinical center.


CONCLUSION
Although these SNPs require validation in an independent population, our results suggest that genetics may play a role in risk of mycophenolate-related hematologic toxicity. This may ultimately provide for better management of maintenance immunosuppression and gives insights into potential mechanism(s) by which toxicity occurs.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Pamala A Jacobson"", ids = ""5535458""); list(name = ""David P.

6d86de80c06b5181c4295d8c66dfd07bb1849c8d,Automatic Enhancement of Two-Dimensional Gel electrophoresis images using Denoising Autoencoder,"Image denoising is an important preprocessing step in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) that strongly affect spot detection or pixel-based methods. Denoising autoen-coders (DAE) is a new approach in deep learning used in image denoising that has a challenging performance. In this study, DAE technique is applied on 2-DGE images motivated by its ability to learn a robust representation to partially corrupted input. DAE is applied on over than 300 real gels got from LEeB 2-D PAGE database. To validate the efficiency of this technique three indicators are used; Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), False discovery rate (FDR) and spot efficiency. The average results before denoising are 0.6332 for SNR and 71.05 for spot efficiency. Whereas, the average results after DAE are 61.3317 for SNR, 99.9944 for FDR and 88.4 for spot efficiency. Moreover, DAE outperforms the denoising wavelet by 1.75 %.",2019,,"list(name = ""Aya Saleh Ahmed"", ids = ""1642166942""); list(name = ""Wessam H.

649df67f1ad56f1db8670fc9e3c51265017cf0b9,Effects on the hepatic transcriptome of chicken embryos in ovo exposed to phenobarbital.,"This work aimed at evaluating the toxic effects of in ovo exposure to phenobarbital (PB) and unveiling the mode of action by transcriptome analysis in the embryonic liver of a model avian species, chicken (Gallus gallus). Embryos were initially treated with saline or 1â€¯Î¼g PB /g egg at Hamburger Hamilton Stage (HHS) 1 (1st day), followed by 20 days of incubation to HHS 46. At 21st day, chicks that pipped successfully were euthanized and dissected for assessing the PB caused effects on phenotypes and the liver transcriptome in both genders. In the PB treatment group, a 7% attenuation in tarsus length was found in females. While no adverse phenotypic effect on the liver somatic index (LSI) was observed, PB caused significant changes in the expressions of 52 genes in males and 516 genes in females (False Discovery Rate < 0.2, p value < 0.05, and absolute fold change > 2). PB exposure modulated the genes primarily enriched in the biological pathways of the cancer, cardiac development, immune response, lipid metabolism, and skeletal development in both genders, and altered expressions of genes related to the cellular process and neural development in females. However, mRNA expressions of chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR)-mediated CYP genes were not induced in the PB treatment groups, regardless of males and females. On the contrary, PB exposure repressed the mRNA expressions of CYP2AC2 in males and CYP2R1, CYP3A37, and CYP8B1 in females. Although transcription factors (TFs) including SREBF1 and COUP-TFII were predicted to be commonly activated in both genders, some TFs were activated in a gender-dependent manner, such as PPARa in males and BRCA1 and IRF9 in females. Taken together, our results provided an insight into the mode of action of PB on the chicken embryos.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiahua Guo"", ids = ""50115701""); list(name = ""Shohei Ito"", ids = ""46481947""); list(name = ""Hoa Thanh Nguyen"", ids = ""144244446""); list(name = ""Kimika Yamamoto"", ids = ""48522272""); list(name = ""Hisato Iwata"", ids = ""46494479"")",,,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,160,"

7e922b6dff5b7563f591feed8677f250825962de,Association of genetic variations with pharmacokinetics and lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin in healthy Korean subjects,"BACKGROUND
Statins are effective agents in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, but treatment response to statins varies among individuals. We analyzed multiple genetic polymorphisms and assessed pharmacokinetic and lipid-lowering responses after atorvastatin 80 mg treatment in healthy Korean individuals.


METHODS
Atorvastatin 80 mg was given to 50 healthy Korean male volunteers. Blood samples were collected to measure plasma atorvastatin and lipid concentrations up to 48 hours after atorvastatin administration. Subjects were genotyped for 1,936 drug metabolism and transporter genetic polymorphisms using the Affymetrix DMET plus array.


RESULTS
The pharmacokinetics and lipid-lowering effect of atorvastatin showed remarkable interindividual variation. Three polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and ABCC2 genes were associated with either the maximum concentration (Cmax) of atorvastatin or changes in total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Minor homozygotes (76.5 ng/mL) of SLCO1B1 c.-910G>A showed higher Cmax than heterozygotes (34.0 ng/mL) and major homozygotes (33.5 ng/mL, false discovery rate P=0.040). Cmax and the area under the plasma concentration curve from hour 0 to infinity (AUCâˆž) were higher in carriers of the SLCO1B1*17 haplotype that included c.-910G>A than in noncarriers (46.1 vs 32.8 ng/mL for Cmax; 221.5 vs 154.2 ng/mL for AUCâˆž). SLCO1B3 c.334G>T homozygotes (63.0 ng/mL) also showed higher Cmax than heterozygotes (34.7 ng/mL) and major homozygotes (31.4 ng/mL, FDR P=0.037). A nonsynonymous ABCC2 c.1249G>A was associated with small total cholesterol and LDL-C responses (0.23% and -0.70% for G/A vs -11.9% and -17.4% for G/G). The Cmax tended to increase according to the increase in the number of minor allele of SLCO1B1 c. -910G>A and SLCO1B3 c.334G>T.


CONCLUSION
Genetic polymorphisms in transporter genes, including SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and ABCC2, may influence the pharmacokinetics and lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin administration.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hye In Woo"", ids = ""5036156""); list(name = ""Suk Ran Kim"", ids = ""144238956""); list(name = ""Wooseong Huh"", ids = ""5772504""); list(name = ""Jae-Wook Ko"", ids = ""50873874""); list(name = ""Sooyoun Lee"", ids = ""26799137"")",11185213469ed9ec457fab6a3ee928d9ed77bd75; 18de81fcdeb9ff502ca24fcd149e10ab468750a7; 9989518eba72fe270ed5a7fb42b9b6506d1a95e2,e9ba26348a75644ff0a958c939b4af1e636328ef; f823e4975522e04facbbb1e9f8df1e46d98e5cf1; f58247f07a57f5f1d41261d3828cb1159d59e8a7; 17424ce1cabbea1da75609568ec6e511c516b055; 100beb55d9f14c3fe7c51a713cfeb65a0b1971bb; d941f78799836d5dbbf9cd198ac68af0bd444ec6; a9ddcdea1857711819f0141b1df99246f7cdc9b8; fcdea82d7e06b89f69bc6900632c3d919c6127fc; 08634eb472c9338cadab5ec7a273e57459895817; 369db968c3654054444819775031fbea866e75a0; 34e7f20f26bd6b34e96fdb783dd2a20fe912d06b; 8df21c36e509629d3cc81749377ac78178e8dec1; c268e6f614285112c33ad9f6919e729c300f17f7; acf3504c5cab88fbe516709d8ee14d537c444751; f71327ae4a04d4da80c253767e8ee3f4eb685440; 9d9f4aef500bf5a01c7d20fa33c1969470d71992; 0a434368c256ba939be1c09b89af139f09b845fd; 6fe633043d808983f9772fde9c55908e4d198ac4; 75eafb03e0cf29aa804ee809c0da34d3efc08603; 80f8d308a1ca0eea529ead6ff4e45ea992ef8f40; 13cb9894680ef497bbfcf30b42945961e878f5a8; 6db84dd5e024aff046fc73c04b6fab2a5fe0a921; ec27b8b147ee9096ba0c36945681261203095bb5; 9d6313937e4c238b33ebd486bf5ef40e68ff671d; 2168e9b25efcabafb58ad6da1f7743f2d3227cc6; 4140293dbf6554e77579e3bbdd6bce18369c7589; 0f3dac2135c884f4197578c0a383fa597532d46f; 135fd26cf074ef77284176eb7f731dd9f664a829; a82b880dec1e166435d341e4e520e9c8f3f72910; 05edcb1e5ab81fa4d98b19d401d7c143a86302ec; 82511a09fc52719cb20a5b32c5f03f2f0cbfe5a8; 76483f997fe0c7d9eea72efc792ccc924b3332de; ea98457f3cf0bfca36e31e702d8e98023204abdd; c50fd6a358305b646e883932e6bfe8dd24b0e443; 28f987d63e71ee89568171e0097549ddcab8b655; 4610cc250d616f50fa78dec3e8d7358e5208515b,"Drug Design, Development and Therapy",11,1135 - 1146
074cdaed0af4eb54a97ab208b4ca1b60af7d4e76,Regulation of the cardiomyocyte transcriptome vs translatome by endothelin-1 and insulin: translational regulation of 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) mRNAs by insulin,"BackgroundChanges in cellular phenotype result from underlying changes in mRNA transcription and translation. Endothelin-1 stimulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with associated changes in mRNA/protein expression and an increase in the rate of protein synthesis. Insulin also increases the rate of translation but does not promote overt cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. One mechanism of translational regulation is through 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (TOPs) that, in response to growth stimuli, promote mRNA recruitment to polysomes for increased translation. TOP mRNAs include those encoding ribosomal proteins, but the full panoply remains to be established. Here, we used microarrays to compare the effects of endothelin-1 and insulin on the global transcriptome of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and on mRNA recruitment to polysomes (i.e. the translatome).ResultsGlobally, endothelin-1 and insulin (1 h) promoted >1.5-fold significant (false discovery rate < 0.05) changes in expression of 341 and 38 RNAs, respectively. For these transcripts with this level of change there was little evidence of translational regulation. However, 1336 and 712 RNAs had >1.25-fold significant changes in expression in total and/or polysomal RNA induced by endothelin-1 or insulin, respectively, of which ~35% of endothelin-1-responsive and ~56% of insulin-responsive transcripts were translationally regulated. Of mRNAs for established proteins recruited to polysomes in response to insulin, 49 were known TOP mRNAs with a further 15 probable/possible TOP mRNAs, but 49 had no identifiable TOP sequences or other consistent features in the 5' untranslated region.ConclusionsEndothelin-1, rather than insulin, substantially affects global transcript expression to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Effects on RNA recruitment to polysomes are subtle, with differential effects of endothelin-1 and insulin on specific transcripts. Furthermore, although insulin promotes recruitment of TOP mRNAs to cardiomyocyte polysomes, not all recruited mRNAs are TOP mRNAs.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomais Markou"", ids = ""4518995""); list(name = ""Andrew K.

Efforts to reduce aflatoxin accumula - tion in maize have focused on identifying and selecting germplasm with natural host resis - tance factors, and several maize lines with sig - nificantly reduced aflatoxin accumulation have been identified. p ast linkage mapping studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) that consistently reduce aflatoxin levels in maize. In addition, an association mapping panel of 300 maize inbred lines was previously created specifically for the dissection of aflatoxin accu - mulation resistance. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using this panel of testcrossed maize hybrids. Each of the inbred parents of the testcrossed hybrids was genotyped by sequencing to gen - erate 261,184 robust single nucleotide polymor - phisms (SNps), and the entire panel was phe - notyped for aflatoxin accumulation following inoculation with A. flavus in multilocation, rep - licated field trials. results uncovered 107 SNp s associated with aflatoxin accumulation in one or more environments in the association panel at a probability level between 9.78 ï‚´ 10 âˆ’6 and 2.87 ï‚´ 10 âˆ’10 . Eight SNp trait associations were found with a false discovery rate (FDr) of less than 10% ( p < 3.83 ï‚´ 10 âˆ’7 ). These SNps occur within the sequence of three uncharacterized genes. Variants in 25 other genomic regions showing high association values over more than one environment are also presented.

0edfeeef678aeabf0561cec72d174f484bd57d45,Transcriptional consequences of XPA disruption in human cell lines.,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mammalian cells requires the xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein (XPA) as a core factor. Remarkably, XPA and other NER proteins have been detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation at some active promoters, and NER deficiency is reported to influence the activated transcription of selected genes. However, the global influence of XPA on transcription in human cells has not been determined. We analyzed the human transcriptome by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We first confirmed that XPA is confined to the cell nucleus even in the absence of external DNA damage, in contrast to previous reports that XPA is normally resident in the cytoplasm and is imported following DNA damage. We then analyzed four genetically matched human cell line pairs deficient or proficient in XPA. Of the âˆ¼14,000 genes transcribed in each cell line, 325 genes (2%) had a significant XPA-dependent directional change in gene expression that was common to all four pairs (with a false discovery rate of 0.05). These genes were enriched in pathways for the maintenance of mitochondria. Only 27 common genes were different by more than 1.5-fold. The most significant hits were AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, involved in steroid hormone metabolism. AKR1C2 protein was lower in all of the immortalized XPA-deficient cells. Retinoic acid treatment led to modest XPA-dependent activation of some genes with transcription-related functions. We conclude that XPA status does not globally influence human gene transcription. However, XPA significantly influences expression of a small subset of genes important for mitochondrial functions and steroid hormone metabolism. The results may help explain defects in neurological function and sterility in individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mandira Manandhar"", ids = ""15958320""); list(name = ""Megan G.

07ea63335805c029e43280000fdbd6c5bd0ccc13,Analysis of global gene expression profiles to identify differentially expressed genes critical for embryo development in Brassica rapa,"Embryo development represents a crucial developmental period in the life cycle of flowering plants. To gain insights into the genetic programs that control embryo development in Brassica rapa L., RNA sequencing technology was used to perform transcriptome profiling analysis of B. rapa developing embryos. The results generated 42,906,229 sequence reads aligned with 32,941 genes. In total, 27,760, 28,871, 28,384, and 25,653 genes were identified from embryos at globular, heart, early cotyledon, and mature developmental stages, respectively, and analysis between stages revealed a subset of stage-specific genes. We next investigated 9,884 differentially expressed genes with more than fivefold changes in expression and false discovery rate â‰¤0.001 from three adjacent-stage comparisons; 1,514, 3,831, and 6,633 genes were detected between globular and heart stage embryo libraries, heart stage and early cotyledon stage, and early cotyledon and mature stage, respectively. Large numbers of genes related to cellular process, metabolism process, response to stimulus, and biological process were expressed during the early and middle stages of embryo development. Fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and photosynthesis-related genes were expressed predominantly in embryos at the middle stage. Genes for lipid metabolism and storage proteins were highly expressed in the middle and late stages of embryo development. We also identified 911 transcription factor genes that show differential expression across embryo developmental stages. These results increase our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events during embryo development in B.rapa and provide a foundation for future studies on other oilseed crops.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yu Zhang"", ids = ""49890311""); list(name = ""Lifang Peng"", ids = ""46484712""); list(name = ""Ya Ming Wu"", ids = ""12116602""); list(name = ""Yanyue Shen"", ids = ""5743194""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Wu"", ids = ""1772198""); list(name = ""Jianbo Wang"", ids = ""48093132"")",d41471987abeee4242941a2e9a6fbcb5af1129f3; e8ced0efeebffb1e69f8e45ae9646198713735d0; c55391850312e8c52fa24bbb2ec8f0a6c181c0a9; 8ed6ea6682b5fed5427e5059c61512cc4797bf61; 4ed4a900edb2ab6afd327cff5d7081340ebfe63c; 9c4ddacf4a18f3169714c5027c5f6db7e8d20e02; e4689471f8b0885a659be8d3f68ad6af16a983ea; 6a0efe1165496f778ca9a632dc97025a8aec6e28; 42ac2fe9941db1cec275b257f321af03af42f748; d2dc20d4e70d2cf055e7e3c6755e9262fcb47d98; e2759ebcc246dbcecc04cb40ca781d0d70dbacba; fa5dccd849bde8c6bf8a830cacf941252f23dd31,e99c98f69c99a6ed244760299993044ec5527fba; a88e5e552324531edb2aabc58047f4ae61c0d311; a6b7748ca158734358f3151f93a7efc354e65329; 6916263e1a73ebd3099f0f14363aa46ce26d2cc9; 866229a7fe4399a6581ef15db2d7c0045d679e9c; 69c8171cdc0adbfa2080251c5d61a93c3a3ce9bf; 88e06fa97572182acb8be300e8d41049e2900a85; fa1e33a6d82f92cb084c622dcb301186fbad3078; fd0d51a850cee7156e0d9edbaf5f2e4de57b30fb; daf7cdc345390ea8f729960704e3faacc318b593; da0cb2d111813c909cfa1e941a18a95dac519a03; 8de75d1f779a65e356a375580431cf107b7e68d2; 42b754f7bb7c59358fe4247b030beb08eaca5016; 60cd0c40d47f5735c62246f6497981d99f3e3dbe; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; a06bdeb8ac58f3bbb64a6d2376f39faff70554c0; a8c44e06aede89766390c62d1f9c75609fbe6de9; 4ceb6081e880862172a6f7b304fad6fa678c12d7; a2449ece0fee949d903058045f803c02b746b316; a2e4d6c4db39bb742a570cff5554335a593d9e91; 965c5e3b8f1f88bb33e56848de4710f550335aa9; 39dc4600140fd5b6156be90e083b12e45f396d2e; 6951e59921512cacf472e8e17a9bd8a987ab2a22; 6f5851f867f5c2af6bfa35fb3f2539ece40479d9; 24172d4a28a394ea56344ea2f5efac2986a6a5f0; be062af276ddd6c15c69097f4d7d329e261085d3; 08adcdf397261960cf143258fee00a7e3437f754; 4e9df240a06dc81130112e45c4012eb2c5c8a0e2; bb2fb63651b92a027d300530d8a6967ff3823493; c880245e0df8f941f77d45dd531a09f398f08d8f; af95476bb03f2f1391c214635243cc4e6a628000; c021d62340ed37a0ad1e478c3afeb833a11dadc5; 1785884ca1e9bf260e1c168cb41779e03521dfc1; bc0396ac65290e642dc815eaf0e00d50d1dbfa2b; 6230224740d15e1f8470a6a2ad5c67efb2f55352; 95abc265f2b5ade21699fbf3bd1a3d3abfed0a3f; e95897c9d4a645a030902acf92c34171aac06ef9; a2da803fd772d10a05fac310da576d8ce7aa1b84; fde34964263ae3850215aa71941cf631c35c6d91; 0ac43e1a4f0e55095fac813f5a75084e93e1b5f0; 7c4ee0baa9dcf30a24b1e20b646b185671b767f7; a07941620bc8b00a515eca4307b14c3f1080999d; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; f16a13ebceccf5f6bb3f788d62fe6b06ce6d8187; 653d039d308137c9b6824200f938b31b496da0bd; 858c0dba0d638bf1e4cd7146a46bb2cf6e26c51d; 68c35092bf1cf1df4c528196970de059513f30a0; 6b8e827c73ce37d3e28dd8c2d8084e2f75db3f5f; 1ee4fc45ffefc54013eb45d3a99f4f9a64dce5d7; 2f5b7036d878f3376c9438bd6ced5216cff44154; 34f00682f32d1e6ad5f738681e23d3d4bce38126; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 15de78c4d6558daad47f85f1fecbaa016a4c8d18; d16c72ba11ba9ee16bc65ae6c2917a40541b36d0; bc64661260932ac7945232518c10a1c260a5dd8b; 23133494895a0eccce0d5f734530e5ba3685f965; e0eb122ad5ae5f60e02e702b947690b0913f6aba,Plant Molecular Biology,86,425-442
9dc0e76abf59104064f8a45e84e5c629a1c9e583,Mapping the bacterial ecology on the phyllosphere of dry and post soaked grass hay for horses,"Soaking hay fodder to reduce dust and soluble carbohydrate (WSC) contents prior to feeding is common practice among horse owners. Soaking can increase bacteria load in hay but no information exists on how this process alters the bacteria profile, which could pose a health risk or digestive challenge, to horses by introducing foreign bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract and so altering the normal profile. The current objectives were to map the bacterial profile of 3 different hays and determine how soaking alters this with the aim of improving best practice when feeding stabled horses. A Perennial Rye grass hay and two meadow s hays were soaked for 0, 1.5, 9 or 16 hours. Pre and post treatment, hays were analysed for WSC and total aerobic bacteria (CFU/g), and differences in bacteria family profiles were determined using ANOVA with significance set at P<0.05. Bacteria were identified via genomic DNA extraction and 16S library preparation (V3 and V4 variable region of 16S rRNA) according to the Illumina protocol. Differences in family operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between individual dry hays and different soaking times were identified via paired t-tests on the DESeq2 normalised data and false discovery rates accounted for using Padj (P<0.05). Mean % WSC losses and actual g/kg lost on DM basis (+/- SE) increased with soaking time being 18% = 30 (10.7), 38% = 72 (43.7), and 42% = 80 (38.8) for 1.5, 9 and 16 hours soak respectively. No relationship existed between WSC leaching and bacteria growth or profile. Grass type influenced bacterial profiles and their responses to soaking, but no differences were seen in richness or Shannon diversity indices. PCA analyses showed clustering of bacteria between meadow hays which differed from the perennial rye grass hay and this difference increased post soaking.

28690d6abbc877cc206f74ccba7c714dbbd9a138,Population Differences in Transcript-Regulator Expression Quantitative Trait Loci,"Gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are useful for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diseases. At times, a genetic variant may be associated with a master regulator involved in the manifestation of a disease. The downstream target genes of the master regulator are typically co-expressed and share biological function. Therefore, it is practical to screen for eQTLs by identifying SNPs associated with the targets of a transcript-regulator (TR). We used a multivariate regression with the gene expression of known targets of TRs and SNPs to identify TReQTLs in European (CEU) and African (YRI) HapMap populations. A nominal p-value of <1Ã—10(-6) revealed 234 SNPs in CEU and 154 in YRI as TReQTLs. These represent 36 independent (tag) SNPs in CEU and 39 in YRI affecting the downstream targets of 25 and 36 TRs respectively. At a false discovery rate (FDR)â€Š=â€Š45%, one cis-acting tag SNP (within 1 kb of a gene) in each population was identified as a TReQTL. In CEU, the SNP (rs16858621) in Pcnxl2 was found to be associated with the genes regulated by CREM whereas in YRI, the SNP (rs16909324) was linked to the targets of miRNA hsa-miR-125a. To infer the pathways that regulate expression, we ranked TReQTLs by connectivity within the structure of biological process subtrees. One TReQTL SNP (rs3790904) in CEU maps to Lphn2 and is associated (nominal p-valueâ€Š=â€Š8.1Ã—10(-7)) with the targets of the X-linked breast cancer suppressor Foxp3. The structure of the biological process subtree and a gene interaction network of the TReQTL revealed that tumor necrosis factor, NF-kappaB and variants in G-protein coupled receptors signaling may play a central role as communicators in Foxp3 functional regulation. The potential pleiotropic effect of the Foxp3 TReQTLs was gleaned from integrating mRNA-Seq data and SNP-set enrichment into the analysis.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Pierre R.

be8ba1d3674dcf002a8b264f1fa5aefafefae073,Model Selection Principles and False Discovery Rate Control,"In this thesis we discuss problems in two cutting-edge topics of modern statistics, namely, high-dimensional statistical inference and large-scale multiple testing. â§ Model selection is indispensable to high-dimensional sparse modeling in selecting the best set of covariates among a sequence of candidate models. Most existing work assumes implicitly that the model is correctly specified or of fixed dimensions. Yet model misspecification and high dimensionality are common in real applications. We investigate two classical Kullback-Leibler divergence and Bayesian principles of model selection in the setting of high dimensional misspecified models. Asymptotic expansions of these principles reveal that the effect of model misspecification is crucial and should be taken into account, leading to the generalized AIC and generalized BIC in high dimensions. With a natural choice of prior probabilities, we suggest the generalized BIC with prior probability which involves a logarithmic factor of the dimensionality in penalizing model complexity. We further establish the consistency of the covariance contrast matrix estimator in a general setting. Our results and new methods are supported by numerical studies. â§ The use of weights provides an effective strategy to incorporate prior domain knowledge in large-scale inference. Our work studies weighted multiple testing in a decision-theoretic framework. We develop oracle and data-driven procedures that aim to maximize the expected number of true positives subject to a constraint on the weighted false discovery rate. The asymptotic validity and optimality of the proposed methods are established. The results demonstrate that incorporating informative domain knowledge enhances the interpretability of results and precision of inference. Simulation studies show that the proposed method controls the error rate at the nominal level, and the gain in power over existing methods is substantial in many settings. An application to genome-wide association study is discussed. â§ Further we discuss connections between the two topics, applications to area(s) of business, and possible future directions.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Protonu Basu"", ids = ""33071717"")",,,,,

Despite known loss of power following dichotomization in the univariate case, it is shown that dichotomizing continuous data can greatly improve the power of multiple testing procedures. To illustrate such gains, the apparently under-appreciated discrete multiple comparisons method is reviewed and applied to the case of dichotomization. The resulting method has precise control of the familywise error rate, and specific power gains relative to comparable methods that use the continuous data are demonstrated. Cases where such power gains are likely (even with normally distributed data) are identified, and applications to biopharmaceutical research are discussed. The first application is to gene expression analysis, where it is shown that power of classical multiple comparisons methods with normally distributed data (even false discovery rate controlling methods) can be arbitrarily low, while the dichotomized family...",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peter H.

However, the scale of top-down proteomics using CZE-MS/MS is still limited due to the low loading capacity and narrow separation window of CZE. In this work, for the first time we systematically evaluated the dynamic pH junction method for focusing of intact proteins during CZE-MS. The optimized dynamic pH junction-based CZE-MS/MS approached a 1 Î¼L loading capacity, 90 min separation window, and high peak capacity (âˆ¼280) for characterization of an Escherichia coli proteome. The results represent the largest loading capacity and the highest peak capacity of CZE for top-down characterization of complex proteomes. Single-shot CZE-MS/MS identified about 2800 proteoform-spectrum matches, nearly 600 proteoforms, and 200 proteins from the Escherichia coli proteome with spectrum-level false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1%. The number of identified proteoforms in this work is over three times higher than that in previous single-shot CZE-MS/MS studies.

Despite advancements in medical and surgical therapies, clinical outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) continue to be poor. Currently, aSAH pathophysiology remains poorly understood. No aSAH biomarkers are commonly used in the clinical setting. This exploratory study used metabolomics profiling to identify global metabolic changes and metabolite predictors of long-term outcome using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of aSAH patients.


METHODS AND METHODS
Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry was applied to CSF samples collected from 15 consecutive high-grade aSAH patients (modified Fisher grade 3 or 4). Collected CSF samples were analyzed at two time points (admission and the anticipated vasospasm timeframe). Metabolite levels at both time points were compared and correlated with vasospasm status and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of patients at 1 year post-aSAH. Significance level was defined as pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Of 97 metabolites identified, 16 metabolites, primarily free amino acids, significantly changed between the two time points. These changes were magnified in modified Fisher grade 4 compared with grade 3. Six metabolites (2-hydroxyglutarate, tryptophan, glycine, proline, isoleucine, and alanine) correlated with GOS at 1 year post-aSAH independent of vasospasm status. When predicting patients who had low disability (GOS 5 vs. GOS â‰¤4), 2-hydroxyglutarate had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.89 and 0.83 respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Our preliminary study suggests that specific metabolite changes occur in the brain during the course of aSAH and that quantification of specific CSF metabolites may be used to predict long-term outcome in patients with aSAH. This is the first study to implicate 2-hydroxyglutarate, a known marker of tissue hypoxia, in aSAH pathogenesis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alex Y Lu"", ids = ""37322867""); list(name = ""Eyiyemisi C.

A novel Bayesian score method is developed to score the protein subnetwork both from the expression of protein and from the protein interaction network structure. Compared with the previous biomarker discovery method, our biomarker motif identification method not only models the expression of each protein, but also the relationship of proteins affected by the proteinâ€protein interaction network.

For example, in our problem of interest concerning HIV vaccine design, we want to infer which HIV peptides interact with which immune system molecules (HLA molecules). For problems of this nature, we are interested in determining the number of non-spurious arcs in a learned graphical model. We describe both a Bayesian and frequentist approach to this problem. In the Bayesian approach, we use the posterior distribution over model structures to compute the expected number of true arcs in a learned model. In the frequentist approach, we develop a method based on the concept of the False Discovery Rate. On synthetic data sets generated from models similar to the ones learned, we find that both the Bayesian and frequentist approaches yield accurate estimates of the number of non-spurious arcs. In addition, we speculate that the frequentist approach, which is non-parametric, may outperform the parametric Bayesian approach in situations where the models learned are less representative of the data. Finally, we apply the frequentist approach to our problem of HIV vaccine design.",2007,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jennifer Listgarten"", ids = ""1760519""); list(name = ""David Heckerman"", ids = ""48099028"")",a439058a6a6edead8c8ac212c0a5ab251e9c2fb2; aa6a49bc2201ef773a565736fb140d2eff48fe95; 868b6903d69ab78ebb963e06e0b654bddc169198; 469e19b34e4c50779be6dae3b176930e1c861255; c231bc47bd74568de169c19942bd9fad427b9fb9; 6f0bc0d3c95bb00b7d611c286e7849aa7558a817; 68d2be33599b1326df5615c34ba0cf04629255f3; b557948bad2d678eaded83058e6e014c76846ed6; a110e4b4fbf05202424ca05b229633c067845ac0; 4a2dd44f8e2e8c2d7ce1232a1344c9b58748f1ca; e90baec624b45c11b21e253ae08b0406aae08e39; 53f98c800a16f27503b9dbd2e36e00a49840c1e6; 90bfda131b354cf41a9c2e6596625ac5f57e1ec3; ac024e5d8f543d4f315531dfbe319bff51b27e74; d054d3a6d54a469ed54597b88eca069c54eece5e; b9109e1aabd51c373aab907f4443b86c2b075b5a; 587768d160f42ed7e3501f96d0ee5ed566027922; c07eb70f6a23c07428b9b6270225b96ad90ad496; 92dbd31515a351cb0d7aae42a251f71b7b32de3c; eda1ca0250e73bca7ef4cb2bf027271352812631; dfa77ad6fc80f1e330b0eeddcd0a0e384e34f405; 6beb0a4ec2823769268ee75636f1f6e5878b032e; 20bcb9e1b75a3ccd1450621aff336c340c108010,0f97a1f916892ac552f26c1d897e40f478b1b264; 1996534efe5671ffe44c95ccd6d6164c0002834a; d97676a7505a446670cfc7a2fd0fc2e2672eaf9f; c801a87e4f48dbe8d988cad384ebeaf24710b3a3; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; bc85c2a7df8207afe6cd2cf1306ad957a296ee5a; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 477847be67109ae0e7da277c188274c09f64d241; 597c11a4f8c7c70a42d57852f61b64eef54e3d32; aa7a54b71c81a4664c2f452ed499c30fdd79a79b; ba6363b984c2d89adcfe97b785745a32c9cf7b33; 2086fe71a443512cd7efe50828fef81be59fe719; c549bf3bb644705fe9a3ffed9dac83a2401f4fa6,ArXiv,abs/1206.5269,
ea7af4bf1a0a25d4e64b54fd3dec47cd72abcead,Clinicopathologic and gene expression analysis of initial biopsies from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis refractory to therapy.,"Some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) do not respond to therapy. The clinicopathologic characteristics and gene expression profile at time of presentation could help predict response to therapy. Refractory EoE was defined as persistence of symptoms and biopsies with histologic features of EoE after 6 months of therapy with proton pump inhibitors and topical corticosteroids. Initial biopsies from refractory EoE patients (n=21), responder to therapy (n=8), patients who relapsed (n=6), and reflux controls (n=24) were studied. RNA was isolated from a subset of cases, and gene expression analysis of 285 genes involved in inflammation was performed using NanoString technology. There was no difference in the presenting symptoms among groups. The number of eosinophils/high-power field among nonresponders was higher (66Â±15) than responders (39Â±8; P<.0001) and similar to patients who relapsed (62Â±11). Six genes were expressed by at least 4-fold compared with reflux at a false discovery rate < 0.05, including overexpression of ALOX15, CCL26, FCER2, RTNLB, and RNASE2, and underexpression of DSG1. EoE patients refractory to therapy or who relapsed showed a trend toward higher ALOX15 expression compared with patients with good response to therapy (364.4- and 425-fold change, P=.097 and P=.07). RTNLB was significantly overexpressed in patients who were refractory to therapy versus those who responded favorably (10-fold versus 3-fold; P<.01). In conclusion, the number of eosinophils/high-power field in the initial biopsy inversely correlates with therapy response. Overexpression of RTNLB in refractory-to-therapy patients and overexpression of ALOX15 and CCL26 suggest that they are critical in the EoE pathogenesis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ayesha S Siddique"", ids = ""46704942""); list(name = ""David C.

This study aimed to explore the monitoring value of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the disease progression of ALS. Methods: From September 2015 to March 2017, ten patients diagnosed with ALS in Peking Union Medical College Hospital completed head MRI scans at baseline and during follow-up. Multimodal MRI analyses, including gray matter (GM) volume measured by voxel-based morphometry; cerebral blood flow (CBF) evaluated by arterial spin labeling; functional connectivity, including low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), measured by resting-state functional MRI; and integrity of white-matter (WM) fiber tracts evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging, were performed in these patients. Comparisons of imaging metrics were made between baseline and follow-up using paired t-test. Results: In the longitudinal comparisons, the brain structure (GM volume of the right precentral gyri, left postcentral gyri, and right thalami) and perfusion (CBF of the bilateral temporal poles, left precentral gyri, postcentral gyri, and right middle temporal gyri) in both motor and extramotor areas at follow-up were impaired to different extents when compared with those at baseline (all P < 0.05, false discovery rate adjusted). Functional connectivity was increased in the motor areas (fALFF of the right precentral gyri and superior frontal gyri, and ReHo of right precentral gyri) and decreased in the extramotor areas (fALFF of the bilateral middle frontal gyri and ReHo of the right precuneus and cingulate gyri) (all P < 0.001, unadjusted). No significant changes were detected in terms of brain WM measures. Conclusion: Multimodal MRI could be used to monitor short-term brain changes in ALS patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dongchao Shen"", ids = ""120753490""); list(name = ""Yin-yan Xu"", ids = ""13849861""); list(name = ""Bo Hou"", ids = ""144246917""); list(name = ""Hongfei Tai"", ids = ""122554367""); list(name = ""Kang Zhang"", ids = ""33298515""); list(name = ""Shuangwu Liu"", ids = ""122050936""); list(name = ""Zhi-li Wang"", ids = ""50218452""); list(name = ""Feng Feng"", ids = ""143964531""); list(name = ""Ming-sheng Liu"", ids = ""46331999""); list(name = ""L.

2ce2dc121b5dfe2bec679dec0ca794de381c6af5,Significance analysis of microarrays outcomes may be altere d by data structures,"The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) is one of the most popular method [1] to identify genes that are differentially expressed under different experimental conditions, or among different types of tissue sample (for example breast cancer which developped metastasis and breast cancer which did not). A modified T-test is computed for each gene to identify genes with significant changes in expression between the samples. In order to take into account the multiplicity of tests, the proportion of genes that are identified by chance (ie identified genes that are false discoveries) is estimated using the FDR (False Discovery Rate) . As pointed out by several authors [2, 3], SAM outcomes may be altered by both pre-SAM data selection (for example arbitrary filtering), and within-SAM data filtering (for example, there is no particular recommendation concerning the choice of the FDR threshold, nor on the number of necessary permutations to calculate this FDR). In addition to these possible alterations, the structure of the data, as for example the distribution of gene expressions and the correlation between these genes, may also influence SAM outcomes. In this study, we proposed to investigate the influence of the data structure in SAM outcomes. With this aim, we performed simulations with different particular data structures, in particular correlation structures. We showed that the SAM ability to detect the true significant genes varied under different conditions of data structures.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Fabien Valet"", ids = ""4083025""); list(name = ""Bernard Asselain"", ids = ""144273042"")",,,,,

Objective: determine whether the procedure applied is valid to obtain sufficient peptides and proteins to establish a protocol and perform mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomic analysis for the resulting peptides. Material and Method: 4 aspirated bronchial samples were included from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, applying the following work flow (I) recollection of aspirated bronchial samples; (II) purification of its protein component; (III) protein digestion in solution; and (IV) mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomic analysis for the resulting peptides. To classify proteins based on cellular component, biological process and molecular function, gene ontology analysis was performed. Results: in the 2.1 mlmeanbronchial sample per patient, a 1% restrictive false discovery rate (FDR)was established;an elevated number of proteins were identified, with an average of 625, range between 529 to 708 and 6.290 single peptides, range between 5.585 to 6.759. The proteincomposition of the samples was uniform, without differences in the classification with regards to cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions. The efficacy of enzymatic digestion was greater than 90% in all cases, which guarantees the reproducibility of the methodology used. Conclusions: themethodology developed for the proteomic analysis is highly effective and reproducible; it identifies a high number of proteins in the bronchial samples and allows us to perform, in a robust manner, a quantitative study in a wide range of patients and control group.

The integration of annotation information and genomic position of functional DNA elements in the Eukaryotic genomes opened the way to test novel hypotheses of higher order genome organization and regulation of expression.ResultsREEF is a new tool, aimed at identifying genomic regions enriched in specific features, such as a class or group of genes homogeneous for expression and/or functional characteristics. The method for the calculation of local feature enrichment uses test statistic based on the Hypergeometric Distribution applied genome-wide by using a sliding window approach and adopting the False Discovery Rate for controlling multiplicity.

6e06f69f1f624156f0442796f80753885583628e,Whole human genome proteogenomic mapping for ENCODE cell line data: identifying protein-coding regions,"BackgroundProteogenomic mapping is an approach that uses mass spectrometry data from proteins to directly map protein-coding genes and could aid in locating translational regions in the human genome. In concert with the ENcyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, we applied proteogenomic mapping to produce proteogenomic tracks for the UCSC Genome Browser, to explore which putative translational regions may be missing from the human genome.ResultsWe generated ~1 million high-resolution tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra for Tier 1 ENCODE cell lines K562 and GM12878 and mapped them against the UCSC hg19 human genome, and the GENCODE V7 annotated protein and transcript sets. We then compared the results from the three searches to identify the best-matching peptide for each MS/MS spectrum, thereby increasing the confidence of the putative new protein-coding regions found via the whole genome search. At a 1% false discovery rate, we identified 26,472, 24,406, and 13,128 peptides from the protein, transcript, and whole genome searches, respectively; of these, 481 were found solely via the whole genome search. The proteogenomic mapping data are available on the UCSC Genome Browser at http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeUncBsuProt.ConclusionsThe whole genome search revealed that ~4% of the uniquely mapping identified peptides were located outside GENCODE V7 annotated exons. The comparison of the results from the disparate searches also identified 15% more spectra than would have been found solely from a protein database search. Therefore, whole genome proteogenomic mapping is a complementary method for genome annotation when performed in conjunction with other searches.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jainab Khatun"", ids = ""50488955""); list(name = ""Yanbao Yu"", ids = ""33944766""); list(name = ""John A.

35a30940b4bf40b99c2570787cfeb76679a2778f,A quantitative shotgun proteomics analysis of germinated rice embryos and coleoptiles under low-temperature conditions,"BackgroundAt low temperatures, rice grains have a reduced germination rate and grow more slowly, which delays the emergence of rice seedlings from the paddy water surface and significantly increases seedling mortality. In this study, we conducted a shotgun proteomics analysis of geminated embryos and coleoptiles to compare the proteome expression pattern between the low-temperature resistant variety, Tong 88-7, and the low-temperature susceptible variety, Milyang 23.ResultsIn a shotgun proteomics analysis of low-temperature resistant and susceptible embryos and coleoptiles in both cold and control temperatures, we discovered a total of 2626 non-redundant proteins, with a 0.01 false discovery rate. A comparison of protein expression patterns between resistant and susceptible embryos and coleoptiles under low-temperature and normal conditions revealed that 85 proteins and 196 proteins were expressed by the resistant and susceptible strains, respectively, in response to low temperature. Among them, 12 proteins overlapped. Proteins involved in stress responses, metabolism, and gene expression were expressed in both strains.ConclusionsSimilar molecular functions of the response were detected, suggesting that the resistant and susceptible strain have a similar proteome response to cold temperatures. The resistance of Tong 88-7 to cold-water germination may result from the efficiency of these proteins, rather than activation of additional or different molecular processes. A comparison of protein expression between the resistant and susceptible strainsâ€™ responses revealed that the more successful low-temperature germination of Tong 88-7 was associated with gibberellin signaling, protein trafficking, and the ABA-mediated stress response.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joohyun Lee"", ids = ""38294753""); list(name = ""Wondo Lee"", ids = ""4197271""); list(name = ""Soon-Wook Kwon"", ids = ""47595484"")",accbf564bf2b77a96f60fd7aede610ee34f8a010; ab3c554aa20626242781431610a653868d10915f; 27cb3d92f145fc2b9fc00ff373b62211689510d6; b1cb180b7c788df2f1d1ea70cfaf34c74a86d137; fc9e81c1431601dfc12bc95dfb67505a0ec9162e,5e4786865f02f3be7ffb5c78dfd0e0d30be00b1c; 3bb70de264953742732b11f54b384a3d04cf1fa1; 035f1cb1e26efe58d9260a05fa261733e570d155; 2f360fb9992952b547393f2e7f20c8b6f10c1716; 031a7fc3c95eca42c3e635a1eedbcf881bbb4cd3; efae43add57ab71f8c80d145ab76f34f8e076814; 1ae856dc44cb423624a5cd25f8dab92b86aa4fe2; f8dd6c38ede7abaccbee64a73da44af8524c284e; 496d1a7ffd07e4d6ffe0067cac5329cf0a6b25ea; 6e2ea98355523c458237c969b0c63e47f81ea767; 0f5e904f66924c93acfec16f880a676c8bf7c87d; 925501b10f6ab72f5bd85f7bf21300954a8c8b4c; 1005294a164b4857cf4a9497329288e2293453f4; 41232a8d12a1cf32c6a8d2cd25bde1a4059de3d9; 75e50367e3152c2b92578a488b5acd0f4b37624b; 65c071f7f2deda4823b26c042ece061ad18d021b; 2f38c9a2fd3f3ca611855fa4ff127f06787c4e8e; b6321e3a1734c1d18f78419ea30bff7f32fd5523; 2fd4373a4e2b292456f854c89ce34f1bec81cd60; 3c901730cf1cda462e9345b3d7bc9f2ad97a414b; ba2f5300070c1f6b86320f91dfb825084ea7f8f8; 31c2f32f9450ae75c27ea5983eae2c4050431e33; 1559e192196e6ef41ecc0e686a70ec48c25593ed; 80899bfa5d94b66605d2c6117981319f2a53e89d; 9655aeac948210fe0ce263ea402ccfa56b28b52a; 842d9899a920557001182e9097d43bd7e396f25a; 933e11db848c8941bd4fd74fdeb27e0a83eae270; ad11d1fcb129b2ab7f5eaf428e595fd9f3c5deed; 5aed05ced445fed9cc64fa39279391152fc522b4; f8947c681b441eb8a43f549c71c2af9a9224f13d; e05e28524487ea5c7f5a9866775b072c2a86dbba; 2b829fb68a855fdb250ed002af9270f8b67b5e7b; d0a8651300b5e80a110e4543052370512fc8a5a9; 0e1777740516d308c0f6e5f9363499af392e1d59; 1a6d0aad425c9ca951a5ad9db670d7a47e77822c; 5babbf6be436fce5835a5cc73be15d1b2b589ee3; 1a860fdda47a8b3c860432c04317e170f69c9718; 54c3adb4fe49184d3527ebd93810ef38c709bb77,Proteome Science,13,
4ef5bdad6956798d1bcde70878160b9cb9aea8a5,[579] Microarrays Analysis for Predicting Treatment Response in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C: Preliminary Data,"Background: Pegylated-interferon plus Ribavirin is the most effective combined treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. However, response rate in naive patients, irrespectively of genotype, is only about 50%. Aim of this study is to characterize gene expression profiles in naive patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, to investigate the molecular basis for treatment failure. Methods: we collected percutaneous needle biopsy specimens from 20 naive patients who underwent treatment with pegylated interferon a2b plus Ribavirin, and from 3 healthy subjects. Differential gene expression was assessed between three groups with different response to treatment: (A) responders (9), (B) non-responders (7), and (C) relapsers (4). The control group was used to assess gene changes associated with chronic hepatitis C. Results: we identified a predictor set of 90 genes (p < 0.05, of which 17 with p 0.01) whose expression patterns differentiated groups with diferent response after a course of standard regimen (group A vs group B). Moreover gene expression protiling contirmed a trend showing an intermediate profile of group C among group A and B. The comparison of average signal of differentially expressed genes exhibited at least a twofold difference in expression and a false discovery rate of less than I%. Between genes with high expression protile (p 0.01) in responder patients, we identified at least one lSGs gene (Interferon-Stimulated genes) that is completely absent in non-responder patients. Moreover we observed an enhanced expression in group A of 4 additional genes involved directly in antiviral response (p i 0.01 ): inflammatory response, ubiquitination, antigen presentation, T helper 2 signaling pathway and apoptosis. One of the genes with high expression in group B and low in group A is directly involved in multidrug resistance. An other one of those expressed (p <0.01) in non-responders is essential in regulating HCV entry and its replication in the cells. In conclusion we identified some significant signature changes associated with different treatment outcomes that - if confirmed increasing sample size and by Real-Time PCR analysis - could be used in the clinical practice to predict response to a standard come regimen.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alessia Ciancio"", ids = ""4523110""); list(name = ""Enzo Medico"", ids = ""2143482""); list(name = ""Antonella Olivero"", ids = ""33383502""); list(name = ""Mara Berrutti"", ids = ""14436154""); list(name = ""Paolo Caviglia"", ids = ""13345603""); list(name = ""Manuela Abbate"", ids = ""33454837""); list(name = ""Paolo Maria Comoglio"", ids = ""4896953""); list(name = ""Antonella Smedile"", ids = ""48679416""); list(name = ""Mario Rizzetto"", ids = ""5616087"")",,,Journal of Hepatology,46,
1556c76517b301dec7decaf3cdf12a2811569516,Controlling the false discovery rate and increasing statistical power in ecological studies,"ABSTRACT Ecologists routinely use Bonferroni-based methods to control the alpha inflation associated with multiple hypothesis testing, despite the aggravating loss of power incurred. Some critics call for abandonment of this approach of controlling the familywise error rate (FWER), contending that too many unwary researchers have adopted it in the name of scientific rigour even though it often does more harm than good. We do not recommend rejecting multiplicity correction altogether. Instead, we recommend using an alternative approach. In particular, we advocate the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg and related methods for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Unlike the FWER approach, which safeguards against falsely rejecting even a single null hypothesis, the FDR approach controls the rate at which null hypotheses are falsely rejected (i.e., false discoveries are made). The FDR approach represents a compromise between outright refusal to control for multiplicity, which maximizes alpha inflation, and strict adherence to FWER control, which minimizes power. We review the multiplicity problem, illustrate the advantage of the FDR approach, and promote this approach for widespread adoption in ecology.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Thomas A.

aec85ad9b2ade14e0f83d8d76f5c275ec9eabce7,Yield of the RYR2 Genetic Test in Suspected Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia and Implications for Test Interpretation,"Background: Pathogenic RYR2 variants account for â‰ˆ60% of clinically definite cases of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. However, the rate of rare benign RYR2 variants identified in the general population remains a challenge for genetic test interpretation. Therefore, we examined the results of the RYR2 genetic test among patients referred for commercial genetic testing and examined factors impacting variant interpretability. Methods: Frequency and location comparisons were made for RYR2 variants identified among 1355 total patients of varying clinical certainty and 60â€‰706 Exome Aggregation Consortium controls. The impact of the clinical phenotype on the yield of RYR2 variants was examined. Six in silico tools were assessed using patient- and control-derived variants. Results: A total of 18.2% (218/1200) of patients referred for commercial testing hosted rare RYR2 variants, statistically less than the 59% (46/78) yield among clinically definite cases, resulting in a much higher potential genetic false discovery rate among referrals considering the 3.2% background rate of rare, benign RYR2 variants. Exclusion of clearly putative pathogenic variants further complicates the interpretation of the next novel RYR2 variant. Exonic/topologic analyses revealed overrepresentation of patient variants in exons covering only one third of the protein. In silico tools largely failed to show evidence toward enhancement of variant interpretation. Conclusions: Current expert recommendations have resulted in increased use of RYR2 genetic testing in patients with questionable clinical phenotypes. Using the largest to date catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia patient versus control comparison, this study highlights important variables in the interpretation of variants to overcome the 3.2% background rate that confounds RYR2 variant interpretation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jamie D.

517d047d3552b68b6845855416236cf9f59844b2,Epigenetic Alterations and an Increased Frequency of Micronuclei in Women with Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia (FM), characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive/mood disturbances, leads to reduced workplace productivity and increased healthcare expenses. To determine if acquired epigenetic/genetic changes are associated with FM, we compared the frequency of spontaneously occurring micronuclei (MN) and genome-wide methylation patterns in women with FM (n = 10) to those seen in comparably aged healthy controls (n = 42 (MN); n = 8 (methylation)). The mean (sd) MN frequency of women with FM (51.4 (21.9)) was significantly higher than that of controls (15.8 (8.5)) (Ï‡ (2) = 45.552; df = 1; P = 1.49 Ã— 10(-11)). Significant differences (n = 69 sites) in methylation patterns were observed between cases and controls considering a 5% false discovery rate. The majority of differentially methylated (DM) sites (91%) were attributable to increased values in the women with FM. The DM sites included significant biological clusters involved in neuron differentiation/nervous system development, skeletal/organ system development, and chromatin compaction. Genes associated with DM sites whose function has particular relevance to FM included BDNF, NAT15, HDAC4, PRKCA, RTN1, and PRKG1.

cd177869d5d35826bc72c8c00f05aa49dd4cc88a,Integrated Regional Cardiac Hemodynamic Imaging and RNA Sequencing Reveal Corresponding Heterogeneity of Ventricular Wall Shear Stress and Endocardial Transcriptome,"BACKGROUND
Unlike arteries, in which regionally distinct hemodynamics are associated with phenotypic heterogeneity, the relationships between endocardial endothelial cell phenotype and intraventricular flow remain largely unexplored. We investigated regional differences in left ventricular wall shear stress and their association with endocardial endothelial cell gene expression.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Local wall shear stress was calculated from 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging in 3 distinct regions of human (n=8) and pig (n=5) left ventricle: base, adjacent to the outflow tract; midventricle; and apex. In both species, wall shear stress values were significantly lower in the apex and midventricle relative to the base; oscillatory shear index was elevated in the apex. RNA sequencing of the endocardial endothelial cell transcriptome in pig left ventricle (n=8) at a false discovery rate â‰¤10% identified 1051 genes differentially expressed between the base and the apex and 327 between the base and the midventricle; no differentially expressed genes were detected at this false discovery rate between the apex and the midventricle. Enrichment analyses identified apical upregulation of genes associated with translation initiation including mammalian target of rapamycin, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling. Genes of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation were also consistently upregulated in the left ventricular apex, as were tissue factor pathway inhibitor (mean 50-fold) and prostacyclin synthase (5-fold)-genes prominently associated with antithrombotic protection.


CONCLUSIONS
We report the first spatiotemporal measurements of wall shear stress within the left ventricle and linked regional hemodynamics to heterogeneity in ventricular endothelial gene expression, most notably to translation initiation and anticoagulation properties in the left ventricular apex, in which oscillatory shear index is increased and wall shear stress is decreased.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Margaret E.

da40ef5e864348135bdcd55e3bd0a205f637af93,Multiple testing in genome-wide association studies via hidden Markov models,"MOTIVATION
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) interrogate common genetic variation across the entire human genome in an unbiased manner and hold promise in identifying genetic variants with moderate or weak effect sizes. However, conventional testing procedures, which are mostly P-value based, ignore the dependency and therefore suffer from loss of efficiency. The goal of this article is to exploit the dependency information among adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve the screening efficiency in GWAS.


RESULTS
We propose to model the linear block dependency in the SNP data using hidden Markov models (HMMs). A compound decision-theoretic framework for testing HMM-dependent hypotheses is developed. We propose a powerful data-driven procedure [pooled local index of significance (PLIS)] that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at the nominal level. PLIS is shown to be optimal in the sense that it has the smallest false negative rate (FNR) among all valid FDR procedures. By re-ranking significance for all SNPs with dependency considered, PLIS gains higher power than conventional P-value based methods. Simulation results demonstrate that PLIS dominates conventional FDR procedures in detecting disease-associated SNPs. Our method is applied to analysis of the SNP data from a GWAS of type 1 diabetes. Compared with the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, PLIS yields more accurate results and has better reproducibility of findings.


CONCLUSION
The genomic rankings based on our procedure are substantially different from the rankings based on the P-values. By integrating information from adjacent locations, the PLIS rankings benefit from the increased signal-to-noise ratio, hence our procedure often has higher statistical power and better reproducibility. It provides a promising direction in large-scale GWAS.


AVAILABILITY
An R package PLIS has been developed to implement the PLIS procedure. Source codes are available upon request and will be available on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/).

db7c3f60a2cc662bf34a6444df00abdb70f5674a,Variable selection procedures from multiple testing,"Variable selection has played an important role in statistical learning and scientific discoveries during the past ten years, and multiple testing is a fundamental problem in statistical inference and also has wide application in many scientific fields. Significant advances have been achieved in both areas. This study attempts to find a connection between adaptive LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and multiple testing procedures in linear regression models.

aeeb38aac3b272e9c26b9446e59c97a789fed923,The false discovery rate for statistical pattern recognition,"The false discovery rate (FDR) and false nondiscovery rate (FNDR) have received considerable attention in the literature on multiple testing. These performance measures are also appropriate for classification, and in this work we develop generalization error analyses for FDR and FNDR when learning a classifier from labeled training data. Unlike more conventional classification performance measures, the empirical FDR and FNDR are not binomial random variables but rather a ratio of binomials, which introduces challenges not present in conventional formulations of the classification problem. We develop distribution-free uniform deviation bounds and apply these to obtain finite sample bounds and strong universal consistency. We also present a simulation study demonstrating the merits of variance-based bounds, which we also develop. In the context of multiple testing with FDR/FNDR, our framework may be viewed as a way to leverage training data to achieve distribution free, asymptotically optimal inference under the random effects model.

f10dbd339da3561671d1d9cdac2f1706ab449333,Functional variants in DCAF4 associated with lung cancer risk in European populations,"Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) responsible for substrate specificity of ubiquitination play a key role in cell-cycle control and DNA damage response. In this study, we assessed associations between 16 599 SNPs in 115 CRL genes and lung cancer risk by using summary data of six published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 12 160 cases and 16 838 cases of European ancestry. As a result, we identified three independent SNPs in DCAF4 (rs117781739, rs12587742 and rs2240980) associated with lung cancer risk (odds ratio = 0.91, 1.09 and 1.09, respectively; 95% confidence interval = 0.88-0.95, 1.05-1.14 and 1.05-1.13, respectively; and P = 3.99 Ã— 10-6, 4.97 Ã— 10-5 and 1.44 Ã— 10-5, respectively) after multiple comparison correction by a false discovery rate <0.05. Since SNP rs12587742 is located within the promoter region and one CpG island of DCAF4, we further performed in silico functional analyses and found that the rs12587742 variant A allele was associated with an increased mRNA expression (P = 2.20 Ã— 10-16, 1.79 Ã— 10-13 and 0.001 in blood cells, normal lung tissues and tumor tissues of lung squamous carcinoma, respectively) and a decreased methylation status (P = 2.48 Ã— 10-9 and 0.032 in adipose and lung tumor tissues, respectively). Moreover, evidence from differential expression analyses further supported an oncogenic effect of DCAF4 on lung cancer, with higher mRNA levels in both lung squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (P = 4.48 Ã— 10-11 and 1.22 Ã— 10-9, respectively) than in adjacent normal tissues. Taken together, our results suggest that rs12587742 is associated with an increased lung cancer risk, possibly by up-regulating mRNA expression and decreasing methylation status of DCAF4.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Zhensheng Liu"", ids = ""9071783""); list(name = ""Yanru Wang"", ids = ""2604876""); list(name = ""Thomas E.

06015a3319ceac21e646cd167f97ffb13c872221,Plasma proteomic profiling and pathway analysis of normal and overconditioned dairy cows during the transition from late pregnancy to early lactation.,"This study applied a quantitative proteomics approach along with bioinformatics analyses to investigate changes in the plasma proteome of normal and overconditioned dairy cows during the transition period. Fifteen weeks before their anticipated calving date, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were selected based on their current and previous body condition scores (BCS) and allocated to either a high or a normal BCS group (19 cows each). They received different diets until dry-off to reach targeted differences in BCS and back fat thickness (BFT) until dry-off. At dry-off, normal BCS cows had a BCS <3.5 (minimum, 2.75) and BFT <1.2 cm (minimum, 0.58), and the high BCS cows had a BCS >3.75 (maximum, 4.50) and BFT >1.4 cm (maximum, 2.90). The proteomics study used a subset of 5 animals from each group. These cows were selected based on their circulating concentrations of fatty acids (FA) on d 14 postpartum and Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) on d 21 postpartum, representing the greater or the lower extreme values within their BCS group, respectively. The high BCS subset (HE-HBCS) had 4.50 < BCS > 3.75, FA = 1.17 Â± 0.46 mmol/L, and BHB = 2.15 Â± 0.42 mmol/L (means Â± SD), and the low BCS subset (LE-NBCS) had 3.50 < BCS > 2.75, FA = 0.51 Â± 0.28 mmol/L, and BHB = 0.84 Â± 0.17 mmol/L. Plasma samples from d -49, +7, and +21 relative to parturition were used for proteome profiling by applying the quantitative tandem mass tags (TMT) approach. Nondepleted plasma samples were subjected to reduction and digestion and then labeled with TMT 10plex reagents. High-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of TMT-labeled peptides was carried out, and the acquired spectra were analyzed for protein identification and quantification. In total, 254 quantifiable proteins (criteria: 2 unique peptides and 5% false discovery rate) were identified in the plasma samples. From these, 24 differentially abundant proteins (14 more abundant, 10 less abundant) were observed in the LE-NBCS cows compared with the HE-HBCS cows during the transition period. Plasma Î±-2-macroglobulins were more abundant in HE-HBCS versus LE-NBCS cows at d +7 and +21. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses of differentially abundant proteins revealed that the acute inflammatory response, regulation of complement activation, protein activation cascade, and regulation of humoral immune response were the most enriched terms in the LE-NBCS group compared with the HE-HBCS group. In addition, we identified 24 differentially abundant proteins (16 in the LE-NBCS group, and 8 in the HE-HBCS group) during the transition period. The complement components C1q and C5 were less abundant, while C3 and C3d were more abundant in LE-NBCS compared with HE-HBCS cows. Overall, overconditioning around calving was associated with alterations in protein pathways related to acute inflammatory response and regulation of complement and coagulation cascades in transition cows.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Morteza Hosseini Ghaffari"", ids = ""40505757""); list(name = ""Katharina Schuh"", ids = ""10297636""); list(name = ""Josipa KuleÅ¡"", ids = ""6445069""); list(name = ""Nicolas Guillemin"", ids = ""12085437""); list(name = ""Anita HorvatiÄ‡"", ids = ""4105333""); list(name = ""Vladimir Mrljak"", ids = ""3722857""); list(name = ""Peter David Eckersall"", ids = ""3856431""); list(name = ""Georg Dusel"", ids = ""46488080""); list(name = ""Christian Koch"", ids = ""47983723""); list(name = ""Hassan Sadri"", ids = ""145435591""); list(name = ""Helga Sauerwein"", ids = ""50103923"")",,,Journal of dairy science,,
768a0eebd4f0f8f1b09321cd4f8955cc5e4391db,Association between Polymorphisms in Cancer-Related Genes and Early Onset of,"There is an increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) among younger people in the western populations. However, the association between genetic polymorphisms and the age of EA onset is unclear. In this study, 1330 functional/ tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 354 cancer-related genes were genotyped in 335 white EA patients. Twenty important SNPs that have the highest importance scores and lowest classification error rate were identified by the random forest algorithm to be associated with early onset of EA (age â‰¤ 55 years). Subsequent logistic regression analysis indicated that 10 SNPs(rs2070744 ofNOS3, rs720321 of BCL2, rs17757541 ofBCL2, rs11775256 of TNFRSF10A, rs1035142 of CASP8, rs2236302 of MMP14, rs4740363 of ABL1, rs696217 of GHRL, rs2445762 of CYP19A1, and rs11941492 of VEGFR2/KDR) were significantly associated with early onset of EA (â‰¤55 vs >55 years, all P < .05 after adjusting for covariates and false discovery rate). Among them, five SNPs in the NOS3, BCL2, TNFRSF10A ,a ndCASP8 genes were known to be involved in apoptosis processes. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, rs2070744 of NOS3, rs720321 of BCL2, and rs1035142 of CASP8 were also significantly associated with early onset of EA. Moreover, there was a higher risk of developing EA at a younger age when one had more risk genotypes.

4b0ec0fd977956946bceec389c0100659df8f34b,Acute liver failure is associated with altered cerebral expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents a serious complication of acute liver failure (ALF) in which cerebral edema leading to brainstem herniation as a result of increased intracranial hypertension is a major consequence. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in coordinating gene expression, with recent studies indicating an influence in the pathogenesis of several diseases. To investigate their involvement in the cerebral pathophysiology of ALF, we profiled the expression of lncRNAs in the frontal cortex of mice at coma stage following treatment with the hepatotoxin azoxymethane. Of the 35,923 lncRNAs profiled using microarrays, 868 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in the ALF-treated group compared to the sham control group. Of these, 382 lncRNAs were upregulated and 486 lncRNAs downregulated. Pathway analysis revealed these lncRNAs target a number of biological and molecular pathways that include cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway, the insulin signaling pathway, and the nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling pathway. False discovery rate adjustment identified 9 upregulated lncRNAs, 2 of which are associated with neuroepithelial transforming gene 1 (NET1) and the monocarboxylate transporter 2 (Slc16a7), potential contributors to astrocyte cytoskeletal disruption/swelling and lactate production, respectively. Our findings suggest an important role for lncRNAs in the brain in ALF in relation to inflammation, neuropathology, and in terms of the functional basis of HE. Further work on these non-coding RNAs may lead to new therapeutic approaches for the treatment and management of cerebral dysfunction resulting from this potentially life-threatening disorder.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""V.

b31f631e82fa10de65dc0e352cd4b6fc18a8cae8,A Powerful Procedure for Pathway-based Meta-Analysis Using Summary Statistics Identifies 43 Pathways Associated with Type II Diabetes in European Populations,"Meta-analysis of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has become an effective approach for detecting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with complex traits. However, it is difficult to integrate the readily accessible SNP-level summary statistics from a meta-analysis into more powerful multi-marker testing procedures, which generally require individual-level genetic data. We developed a general procedure called Summary based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (sARTP) for conducting gene and pathway meta-analysis that uses only SNP-level summary statistics in combination with genotype correlation estimated from a panel of individual-level genetic data. We demonstrated the validity and power advantage of sARTP through empirical and simulated data. We conducted a comprehensive pathway-based meta-analysis with sARTP on type 2 diabetes (T2D) by integrating SNP-level summary statistics from two large studies consisting of 19,809 T2D cases and 111,181 controls with European ancestry. Among 4,713 candidate pathways from which genes in neighborhoods of 170 GWAS established T2D loci were excluded, we detected 43 T2D globally significant pathways (with Bonferroni corrected p-values < 0.05), which included the insulin signaling pathway and T2D pathway defined by KEGG, as well as the pathways defined according to specific gene expression patterns on pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma. Using summary data from 8 eastern Asian T2D GWAS with 6,952 cases and 11,865 controls, we showed 7 out of the 43 pathways identified in European populations remained to be significant in eastern Asians at the false discovery rate of 0.1. We created an R package and a web-based tool for sARTP with the capability to analyze pathways with thousands of genes and tens of thousands of SNPs. Author Summary As GWAS continue to grow in sample size, it is evident that these studies need to be utilized more effectively for detecting individual susceptibility variants, and more importantly to provide insight into global genetic architecture of complex traits. Towards this goal, identifying association with respect to a collection of variants in biological pathways can be particularly insightful for understanding how networks of genes might be affecting pathophysiology of diseases. Here we present a new pathway analysis procedure that can be conducted using summary-level association statistics, which have become the main vehicle for performing meta-analysis of individual genetic variants across studies in large consortia. Through simulation studies we showed the proposed method was more powerful than the existing state-of-art method. We carried out a comprehensive pathway analysis of 4,713 candidate pathways on their association with T2D using two large studies with European ancestry and identified 43 T2D-associated pathways. Further examinations of those 43 pathways in 8 Asian studies showed that some pathways were trans-ethnically associated with T2D.

The combined indicator of vitamin B-12 status (cB-12) was computed. Targeted metabolites [166 acylcarnitines, amino acids, sugars, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry)], and untargeted metabolites [247 chemical entities (gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry)] were measured at baseline and 4 mo after treatment. A peripheral nerve score was developed. Differences before and after treatment were examined. For targeted metabolomics, the data from 18 individuals with adequate vitamin B-12 status (selected from the same population) were added to the before-and-after treatment data set. Network visualizations and metabolic pathways are illustrated.Results: The injection increased serum vitamin B-12, holotranscobalamin, and cB-12 (P < 0.001), and reduced tHcy and serum MMA (P < 0.001). Metabolomic changes from before to after treatment included increases (P < 0.001) in acylcarnitines, plasmalogens, and other phospholipids, whereas proline and other intermediaries of one-carbon metabolism-that is, methionine and cysteine-were reduced (P < 0.001). Direct significant correlations (P < 0.05 after the false discovery rate procedure) were identified between acylcarnitines, plasmalogens, phospholipids, lyso-phospholipids, and sphingomyelins compared with vitamin B-12 status and nerve function. Multiple connections were identified with primary metabolites (e.g., an inverse relation between vitamin B-12 markers and tryptophan, tyrosine, and pyruvic, succinic, and citric acids, and a direct correlation between the nerve score and arginine).Conclusions: The human serum metabolome in vitamin B-12 deficiency and the changes that occur after supplementation are characterized. Metabolomics revealed connections between vitamin B-12 status and serum metabolic markers of mitochondrial function, myelin integrity, oxidative stress, and peripheral nerve function, including some previously implicated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases.

In a high dimensional setting however, selecting the fixed effect coefficients in these models is mandatory as classical tools are not performing well. By considering the random effects as missing values in the linear mixed model framework, a @?^1-penalization on the fixed effects coefficients of the resulting log-likelihood is proposed. The optimization problem is solved via a multicycle Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm which allows for the number of parameters p to be larger than the total number of observations n and does not require the inversion of the sample nxn covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm can be combined with any variable selection method developed for linear models. A variant of the proposed approach replaces the @?^1-penalization with a multiple testing procedure for the variable selection aspect and is shown to greatly improve the False Discovery Rate. Both methods are implemented in the MMS R-package, and are shown to give very satisfying results in a high-dimensional simulated setting.",2014,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Florian Rohart"", ids = ""50704309""); list(name = ""Magali San Cristobal"", ids = ""8291398""); list(name = ""BÃ©atrice Laurent"", ids = ""32722726"")",1ecd4588a28f9386e3cfb1f10cb9f381a602cc8c; 77cfc1e3442de8826c50fb2ab53e84154634365f; df5f8ec435ced294153336358d242b5d0a3ccad0; 9d7c347513b1b55d56a47ed57f9b81c9a3562cc8; cc48cd26d83f9e75da1e97f5cb82e51d6c6294a2; 3b90320aa1c9ead8b78455eddb081e24f575f25c; 6d4f8f88d8cf1de06fd2a30769529a8dfe401c60; 8ad93d603f9f8d0a5dec896f063f5bc587c0dbf7,,Comput.

faf251d6f3fa27716503327fb12a4e8ba3bc5d20,Regularized estimation of large-scale gene association networks using graphical Gaussian models,"BackgroundGraphical Gaussian models are popular tools for the estimation of (undirected) gene association networks from microarray data. A key issue when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples is the estimation of the matrix of partial correlations. Since the (Moore-Penrose) inverse of the sample covariance matrix leads to poor estimates in this scenario, standard methods are inappropriate and adequate regularization techniques are needed. Popular approaches include biased estimates of the covariance matrix and high-dimensional regression schemes, such as the Lasso and Partial Least Squares.ResultsIn this article, we investigate a general framework for combining regularized regression methods with the estimation of Graphical Gaussian models. This framework includes various existing methods as well as two new approaches based on ridge regression and adaptive lasso, respectively. These methods are extensively compared both qualitatively and quantitatively within a simulation study and through an application to six diverse real data sets. In addition, all proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package ""parcor"", available from the R repository CRAN.ConclusionIn our simulation studies, the investigated non-sparse regression methods, i.e. Ridge Regression and Partial Least Squares, exhibit rather conservative behavior when combined with (local) false discovery rate multiple testing in order to decide whether or not an edge is present in the network. For networks with higher densities, the difference in performance of the methods decreases. For sparse networks, we confirm the Lasso's well known tendency towards selecting too many edges, whereas the two-stage adaptive Lasso is an interesting alternative that provides sparser solutions. In our simulations, both sparse and non-sparse methods are able to reconstruct networks with cluster structures. On six real data sets, we also clearly distinguish the results obtained using the non-sparse methods and those obtained using the sparse methods where specification of the regularization parameter automatically means model selection. In five out of six data sets, Partial Least Squares selects very dense networks. Furthermore, for data that violate the assumption of uncorrelated observations (due to replications), the Lasso and the adaptive Lasso yield very complex structures, indicating that they might not be suited under these conditions. The shrinkage approach is more stable than the regression based approaches when using subsampling.",2009,Medicine; Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nicole KrÃ¤mer"", ids = ""145125419""); list(name = ""Juliane SchÃ¤fer"", ids = ""47573346""); list(name = ""Anne-Laure Boulesteix"", ids = ""1751504"")",,,BMC Bioinformatics,10,384 - 384

We aimed to characterize the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or IDO-induced tryptophan degradation-dependent pathways, which may lead to suppression of T cells and possible protection against atherosclerosis.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Expression of IDO and IDO-related pathway components was analyzed in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques (n = 24) and in non-atherosclerotic arteries (n = 6). Up-regulation of IDO and genes related to the IDO pathway was found to be pronounced in atherosclerotic plaques. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated IDO protein in the atheromatous core and co-distribution with monocyte-macrophages (CD68-positive cells). In gene-set enrichment analysis, the IDO pathway revealed a significant (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.07) regulatory T cell, fork-head box protein 3 (FoxP3)-initiated CD28-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)-inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)-driven pathway leading to activation of IDO expression in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Expression of these IDO pathway genes varied between 2.1- and 16.8-fold as compared to control tissues (P < 0.05 for all).

IDO and the IDO-related pathway are important mediators of the immunoinflammatory responses in advanced atherosclerosis offering new viable therapeutic targets for the development of antiatherogenic immunosuppressive therapies.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""P.

97aed66f326008d4d257316acbc59a075f346e2b,Multi-omic integrated networks connect DNA methylation and miRNA with skeletal muscle plasticity to chronic exercise in Type 2 diabetic obesity.,"Epigenomic regulation of the transcriptome by DNA methylation and posttranscriptional gene silencing by miRNAs are potential environmental modulators of skeletal muscle plasticity to chronic exercise in healthy and diseased populations. We utilized transcriptome networks to connect exercise-induced differential methylation and miRNA with functional skeletal muscle plasticity. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis were collected from middle-aged Polynesian men and women with morbid obesity (44 kg/m(2) Â± 10) and Type 2 diabetes before and following 16 wk of resistance (n = 9) or endurance training (n = 8). Longitudinal transcriptome, methylome, and microRNA (miRNA) responses were obtained via microarray, filtered by novel effect-size based false discovery rate probe selection preceding bioinformatic interrogation. Metabolic and microvascular transcriptome topology dominated the network landscape following endurance exercise. Lipid and glucose metabolism modules were connected to: microRNA (miR)-29a; promoter region hypomethylation of nuclear receptor factor (NRF1) and fatty acid transporter (SLC27A4), and hypermethylation of fatty acid synthase, and to exon hypomethylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and Ser/Thr protein kinase. Directional change in the endurance networks was validated by lower intramyocellular lipid, increased capillarity, GLUT4, hexokinase, and mitochondrial enzyme activity and proteome. Resistance training also lowered lipid and increased enzyme activity and caused GLUT4 promoter hypomethylation; however, training was inconsequential to GLUT4, capillarity, and metabolic transcriptome. miR-195 connected to negative regulation of vascular development. To conclude, integrated molecular network modelling revealed differential DNA methylation and miRNA expression changes occur in skeletal muscle in response to chronic exercise training that are most pronounced with endurance training and topographically associated with functional metabolic and microvascular plasticity relevant to diabetes rehabilitation.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""David Stephen Rowlands"", ids = ""8727453""); list(name = ""Rachel A Page"", ids = ""50226521""); list(name = ""William R Sukala"", ids = ""6970980""); list(name = ""Mamta Giri"", ids = ""48754182""); list(name = ""Svetlana D Ghimbovschi"", ids = ""3511804""); list(name = ""Irum Hayat"", ids = ""32336908""); list(name = ""Birinder S Cheema"", ids = ""66600360""); list(name = ""Isabelle Lys"", ids = ""3522990""); list(name = ""Murray J Leikis"", ids = ""4535439""); list(name = ""Phillip Sheard"", ids = ""19645526""); list(name = ""St John Wakefield"", ids = ""34740831""); list(name = ""Bernhard H.

Fibroblast growth factor 1 gene (FGF1) is one of the most relevant candidates having been associated not only with familial susceptibility to hypertension but also with up-regulation within the glomerulus of the human hypertensive kidney/Circulation 2007;116:1915â€“24/. We have hypothesised that systematic analysis of genes interacting with FGF1 may uncover novel variants underlying essential hypertension. Seventy-nine common (minor allele frequencyâ‰¥0.1) tagging (r2â‰¥0.8) and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning eight critical components of the FGF (fibroblast growth factor) pathway (FGF2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFBP1, FIBP, SPRY1) were genotyped by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in 629 subjects from 207 Polish hypertensive families (Silesian Hypertension Study â€” SHS). 83.5% of genotyped SNPs that passed quality control filters provided 92.9% genetic coverage of FGF pathway loci. Family-based analysis in SHS revealed that alleles of three SNPs (rs2956724, rs2245964 and rs16892645) in two loci (FGFR1 and FGFBP1) were transmitted to hypertensive offspring more frequently than expected by chance. However, only one association survived correction for multiple testing â€“ major allele of rs16892645 in FGFBP1 was over-transmitted from heterozygous parents to hypertensive offspring more frequently than expected by chance(p=0.0048, false discovery rate",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maciej Tomaszewski"", ids = ""3643566""); list(name = ""Fadi J.

552f6f6abc467c58be85e1db90a138e9f53fed68,"Space-time visualization and detection of health disparities using geostatistics and a space-Time information system: The case of prostate and cervix cancer mortality in the United States, 1970-1994","B6 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) facilitate digital cartography, and Atlases of health outcomes for both infectious and chronic diseases are now published by national and state health agencies. These have proven useful for quantifying patterns in health outcomes such as incidence and mortality, for documenting access to health care, providing tools for risk communication and for assessing disparities in cancer burdens in underserved populations. Notwithstanding these benefits, there are substantial limitations that arise from using conventional GIS technology, in particular for the visualization and detection of health disparities in cancer mortality. First, the smaller size of minority populations leads to rates that can be very unreliable and need to be stabilized prior to any analysis. Second, the interpretation of choropleth maps suffers from the common biased visual perception that larger rural and sparsely populated areas are of greater importance. Third, the temporal nature of the data is not properly accounted for in most GIS, which hampers the visualization of temporal trends that can pinpoint locations where disparities greatly increased over time and health policies need to be changed. Fourth, the analysis of health disparities over small geographic areas suffers from the multiple testing problem caused by the repeated use of statistical tests and leading to misclassify disparities as present when they actually are not.â€¨ This paper presents recent developments in the field of space-time information system and geostatistical analysis of cancer rate data. A methodology is presented to create isopleth maps of cancer mortality risk from observed rates and to propagate the uncertainty attached to the risk estimates through the detection of significant health disparities. Spatial patterns are characterized using population-weighted semivariograms, while Poisson kriging incorporates the size and shape of administrative units, as well as the population density, into the filtering of noisy mortality rates. Temporal changes in health disparities are investigated using both absolute (rate difference) and relative (rate ratio) measures, while the False Discovery Rate approach is used for multiple testing correction. The approach is applied to the detection of disparities in cervix and prostate cancer mortality between black and white populations, using data recorded over all US State Economic Areas for five time periods of 5 years each.â€¨ The two cancers display opposite temporal trends: prostate cancer mortality rates have steadily increased since 1970, while prevention has reduced the mortality rate for cervix cancer during the same period. The absolute measure of disparity indicates that the gap between white and black mortality rates widens for prostate cancer while it shrinks for cervix cancer. This decline is however no longer observed when factoring in the temporal trend through the computation of rate ratios. The assessment of significant racial disparities across geographic areas is an important tool in guiding cancer control practices, and public health officials must consider the problems of small population size and multiple comparisons, and should conduct disparity analyses using both absolute and relative measures.",2007,Geography,"list(name = ""Pierre Goovaerts"", ids = ""2289987"")",,,Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Biomarkers,16,

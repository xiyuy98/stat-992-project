a97a0302c2ae7c0364abf98d5d1d8dc937b4c1a7,Essentiality of mmpL3 and impact of its silencing on Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene expression,"MmpL3 is an inner membrane transporter of Mycobacterium tuberculosis responsible for the export of trehalose momomycolate, a precursor of the mycobacterial outer membrane component trehalose dimycolate (TDM), as well as mycolic acids bound to arabinogalactan. MmpL3 represents an emerging target for tuberculosis therapy. In this paper, we describe the construction and characterization of an mmpL3 knockdown strain of M. tuberculosis. Downregulation of mmpL3 led to a stop in bacterial division and rapid cell death, preceded by the accumulation of TDM precursors. MmpL3 was also shown to be essential for growth in monocyte-derived human macrophages. Using RNA-seq we also found that MmpL3 depletion caused up-regulation of 47 genes and down-regulation of 23 genes (at least 3-fold change and false discovery rate â‰¤1%). Several genes related to osmoprotection and metal homeostasis were induced, while several genes related to energy production and mycolic acids biosynthesis were repressed suggesting that inability to synthesize a correct outer membrane leads to changes in cellular permeability and a metabolic downshift.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Giulia Degiacomi"", ids = ""48667675""); list(name = ""Andrej Benjak"", ids = ""46721538""); list(name = ""Jan Madacki"", ids = ""48609396""); list(name = ""Francesca Boldrin"", ids = ""3359161""); list(name = ""Roberta Provvedi"", ids = ""46652162""); list(name = ""Giorgio PalÃ¹"", ids = ""5091521""); list(name = ""Jana KordulÃ¡kovÃ¡"", ids = ""47193649""); list(name = ""Stewart T Cole"", ids = ""6086791""); list(name = ""Riccardo Manganelli"", ids = ""46857481"")",e97e2f745829c3c91e067c0659b2dccf4b257115; 656b404877787e972419bf7935a5051ad8fd0a86; c209de1283bf3c20999011e48f2c5e6eda2fbdc2; bf56ea7124356df230fe09da36f466fe86491243; 0b6638c66d4a671f1aac9fc81951e99b671927f7; c9722dc898f1536ced677919552effbd1d5f0e41; 4ecb7ab9f9d1d3fa13f06f5cd769ab2d8059f38a; 8023c620de64f8723d6d1c5c744dea8c56647703; 83e11371c8c94183c1b2aeb21dfa36dd6cdd1326; b6f166f05b50703806eb467ea5215994e2cfe68e; 54fac988fab4298458eb2518ac763d675240f4d6; 9146afbf3e0591971a694e2cd92175f0e504e328; bddacb0baf5552de01c0fc5902e7f0b849921e79; d572b2820999308362635d4406c72d1c6d9bc632; 52d36c94fed448052e324d46cc3ce179cccd5abb; 85b7cf333e304918144da949e86749b071590281; 76cdab6e8c83c13ad127c77a1b872c52b9f02041; 82423cb0842b74226c0831b15064e4c451a8d42e; 6a80a3a14e6572e089ed11e9b55a72ee6b5b589b,40a8f36b919f174dbce321dbbe00d639bb9213bc; 8c5e2648a680ef9de1243673986479d27e2515bc; 0744a50f404f7e088349dd8372c909ac07994466; 56dce3f373cbd2553794c9e19f1812e2f7fd7a7d; 87d143e3677c4ea1bea13f156bdf3afa4ca56b76; fcbe4fb5f51ff2341d79e338fa87291913c4777c; ac4edee149fb6c84e4cea79e58a8b899ebd6a9cd; f030d83780d99235c565a9363ff1b3893b542aa5; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; 667b43c8adad628c60c20810197cdeec6679714e; 772f5fca88de0f6f38116d73cc32e23efe780a10; d2766f833f9dc892ce8763661bc11b49a5bdc354; 417a593e25244294ccc56585f385b018cfa0ec03; d98d8dbe1054276ee586c9731e80019b03478bcc; d72764d4315bc88abdb442183c1dff76e1be11ae; 4060ab62c6bc4e40efd33151776ce7bcff94fcb4; fefd07e66cad18227b15a72114de21122f6f86f6; 5fe873b30901d581b7b9c6de8dc0290008fdfef0; 0b0eadf842fae78176f8522b9bcf168e4c2349d6; 491c412099b48b3296c1dbe956f62173d6778207; 19d124b271444ac29d51f48a0c94c1dc2312761b; 927034be3daa5b506839ac3bde6cbcb96d355723; cd2192f371b5607862a68bda6c503d8a0e5e60fd; 08bbbbf77b7b1f0d72cad118d47dd868187af4e4; d52f258ed291473476868f2a53d37f6cb08ae047; df2c912721ae3bffe1095c65b7f3bcec1af793df; 53b4d6a07e10e8cf8232b15a70ecc10c7a23c2ec; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; ae282ee403e557aaf3b2f93fb2be9bbf71c94ed9; 39e1b02063e724ffafc17343f12d9ef47aa70e8c; 33610185e782391f5947b94a3dc3e073384a0fb8; 0bda5861b03292e26924cfddbbc7f254aa8298d2; bb07daf73252a8e71eb70630bb547eb897972f6e; 11b32a26adffd501472e640e3e645457dc7cc618; 825f51636a11dc76906755b99a3048d843225792; d1aab452ad760a8c52431f666136b3bf67425ebc; 0321e292a7bfebedaa1e1bd9d531a3cb16e70b98; afdcbb5534b24a03f5665660713083a9a56ea00f; 0dd9de3887ddd3f4212ddc59ec64eac8dd22a02c; cdbe8a265ef4bd8350722d2209fc6cc6290da1b3; 75cf37527bec618ee661bbfa58e082483a5a486a,Scientific Reports,7,
635fab479dee273428e80d1f0d8e8609f850dadf,Controlling the marginal false discovery rate in inferences from a soil dataset with &agr;â€investment,"Large datasets on soil provide a temptation to search for relations between variables and then to model and make inferences about them with statistical methods more properly used to test preplanned hypotheses on data from designed experiments or sample surveys. The control of family-wise error rate (FWER) is one way to improve the robustness of inferences from tests of multiple hypotheses. In its simplest form, hypothesis testing with FWER control lacks statistical power. The Î±-investment approach to controlling the marginal false discovery rate is one method proposed to improve statistical power. In this paper I outline the Î±-investment approach and then demonstrate it in the analysis of a dataset on the rate of CO2 emission from incubated intact cores of soil from a transect over Cretaceous rocks in eastern England. Hypotheses are advanced after considering the literature and examining relations among the available soil variables that might be proposed as explanatory factors for the variation of CO2 emissions. They are then tested in sequence with Î±-investment, such that the rejection of null hypotheses increases the power to reject later ones, while controlling the overall marginal false discovery rate at a specified value. This paper illustrates the use of Î±-investment to test a multiple set of hypotheses on a soil dataset; statistical power is improved by ordering the sequence of hypotheses on the basis of process knowledge. The approach could be useful in other areas of soil science where covariates must be selected for predictive statistical models, notably in the development of pedotransfer functions and in digital soil mapping.

3c53e1b3988a41f05bfbebfb763ea7bdb06e8c9d,Alteration of gene expression in mammary gland tissue of dairy cows in response to dietary unsaturated fatty acids.,"The aim of this study was to determine the effects of supplementing unprotected dietary unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) from different plant oils on gene expression in the mammary gland of grazing dairy cows. A total of 28 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in mid-lactation were blocked according to parity, days in milk, milk yield and fat percentage. The cows were then randomly assigned to four UFA sources based on rapeseed, soybean, linseed or a mixture of the three oils for 23 days, after which, all 28 cows were switched to a control diet for an additional 28 days. On the last day of both periods, mammary gland biopsies were taken to study genome-wide differences in gene expression on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Bovine Genome Arrays (no. 900493) by ServiceXS (Leiden, The Netherlands). Supplementation with UFAs resulted in increased milk yield but decreased milk fat and protein percentages. Furthermore, the proportion of de novo fatty acids (FAs) in the milk was reduced, whereas that of long-chain FAs increased. Applying a statistical cut-off of false discovery rate of q-values <0.05 together with an absolute fold change of 1.3, a total of 972 genes were found to be significantly affected through UFA supplementation, indicating that large transcriptional adaptations occurred in the mammary gland when grazing dairy cows were supplemented with unprotected dietary UFA. Gene sets related to cell development and remodeling, apoptosis, nutrient metabolic process, as well as immune system response were predominantly downregulated during UFA supplementation. Such molecular knowledge on the physiology of the mammary gland might provide the basis for further functional research on dairy cows.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""NÃºria Mach"", ids = ""2312258""); list(name = ""A A A Jacobs"", ids = ""39467405""); list(name = ""Leo Kruijt"", ids = ""6085984""); list(name = ""J van Baal"", ids = ""40014658""); list(name = ""Mari A.

Background: Although AIs are highly effective suppressants of estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women, up to 50% of patients derive little or no clinical benefit from AI treatment. The proliferation marker Ki67 provides a valuable pharmacodynamic marker for response in the presurgical setting and 2 week measurements of this marker have been shown to predict recurrence-free survival 1 . However, understanding of the precise molecular effects of AIs and causes of resistance is limited. We present, to our knowledge, the largest study of the transcriptional effects of AI treatment in the neoadjuvant setting. Methods: Baseline and 2wk post-treatment core-cut tumor biopsies were obtained from 112 postmenopausal women with stage I to IIIB ER+ early breast cancer who received single agent neoadjuvant anastrozole 2 . RNA extracted from biopsies was analysed on Illumina 48K microarrays. Genes which changed expression upon anastrozole treatment were identified using paired class comparison of the 81 matched baseline and 2wk pairs from which gene expression data was available. Correlates of response were determined using multiple testing corrected Spearman correlation analysis. Pathway analysis was performed on the ranked list of correlated genes. IHC for Ki67, ER and PgR was performed centrally on FFPE sections from duplicate core biopsies. Results: At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01, 1154 genes were differentially expressed (792 down-regulated and 362 up-regulated). Proliferation-associated genes and classical estrogen-dependent genes such as TOP2A, CCNB2, TFF1, and PDZK1 were strongly downregulated (FDR -7 ). Upregulated genes included collagens and chemokines such as COL16A1 and CCL14. Pathway analysis revealed cell cycle, estrogen receptor and apoptosis-related pathways to be amongst the most significantly altered (P TNF, CXCR3 and IL2RA was associated with poorer response, while expression of GATA3 was associated with more favourable response (P 1.

To evaluate the expression profile of cell-free circulating microRNA (miRNA) in systemic sclerosis (SSc), healthy controls (HC), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. Total RNA was purified from plasma and 45 different, mature miRNA were measured using quantitative PCR assays after reverse transcription. Samples (n = 189) were from patients with SSc (n = 120), SLE (n = 29), and from HC (n = 40). Expression data were clustered by principal components analysis, and diagnostically specific miRNA profiles were developed by leave-one-out cross-validation. Diagnostic probability scores were derived from stepwise logistic regression. Results. Thirty-seven miRNA specificities were consistently detected and 26 of these were unaffected by SSc sample age and present in more than two-thirds of SSc samples. SSc cases showed a distinct expression profile with 14/26 miRNA significantly decreased (false discovery rate < 0.05) and 5/26 increased compared with HC. A 21-miRNA classifier gave optimum accuracy (80%) for discriminating SSc from both HC and SLE. The discrimination between HC and SSc (95% accuracy) was strongly driven by miRNA of the 17~92 cluster and by miR-16, -223, and -638, while SLE and SSc differed mainly in the expression of miR-142-3p, -150, -223, and -638. Except for a weak correlation between anti-Scl-70 and miR-638 (p = 0.048), there were no correlations with other patient variables. Conclusion. Circulating miRNA profiles are characteristic for SSc compared with both HC and SLE cases. Some of the predicted targets of the differentially regulated miRNA are of relevance for transforming growth factor-Î² signaling and fibrosis, but need to be validated in independent studies.

E-mail: nhe@ssi.dk Accepted for publication October 1, 2014. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of connective tissues associated with cutaneous and organ fibrosis, occlusive vasculopathy, specific types of circulating autoantibodies, and a highly variable clinical course. The etiology of SSc is unknown, but perivascular inflammation is an early and central pathogenetic event and leads to aberrant activation or increased synthesis of various collagen cross-linking enzymes and subsequent increased synthesis/cross-linking and decreased degradation of collagen1,2,3,4. The class of noncoding small RNA called microRNA (miRNA) regulates the expression of most protein-coding genes at the post-transcriptional level by interfering with translation of target mRNA. Typically, miRNA have multiple mRNA Journal of Rheumatology The on November 17, 2014 Published by www.jrheum.org Downloaded from targets in inflammatory and fibrosis pathways (including growth factors, enzymes, and cytokines), are themselves regulated by inflammatory cytokine/cytokine receptor networks5, and are dysregulated in cells of the innate and adaptive immune system from patients with autoimmune disorders6,7,8. Thus, specific miRNA have been shown to be differentially expressed in fibrotic diseases such as SSc (miRNA-29)9 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis10 (the miRNA-17~92 cluster). The miRNA-17~92 cluster targets, for example, fibrotic and antiangiogenic genes and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-1 expression and is downregulated in fibrotic lung tissue. miRNA-29, which also targets DNMT-1 expression, is depressed in SSc dermal fibroblasts and regulates type I and III collagen expression9. Differential expression of miRNA was also noted in a study of sclerodermic skin biopsies11. Expression profiles of miRNA may thus be associated with diagnosis and classification of SSc and constitute potential therapeutic targets. From a diagnostic viewpoint, the presence of a population of stable, circulating miRNA in the blood12,13 that may include specific contributions from pathological cells and tissues in cancer and autoimmunity is valuable, and studies have demonstrated specific profiles associated with systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)14. Because of the unique dominance of fibrosis in SSc, we hypothesized that the circulating miRNA profile in this condition might be characteristic and different from those in other systemic autoimmune diseases and possibly related to subtypes of SSc. To address this hypothesis, we investigated levels of a panel of 45 specific miRNA in plasma samples collected under controlled conditions from a cohort of 120 patients with SSc, 29 patients with SLE, and 40 healthy controls (HC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients and methods. Our cross-sectional study included 120 patients with SSc with a median age of 57 years (range 22â€“79 yrs) fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria15 for SSc (Table 1). Patients were included consecutively over 2 years. Skin involvement was graded according to the modified Rodnan skin score16. Seven patients with SSc were receiving disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD; azathioprine, methotrexate, or anti-malarials) and 6 were taking prednisolone (together with DMARD in 4 cases) at the time of inclusion. None of the patients had ever received therapy with biological drugs or prostanoid infusions within 6 months of inclusion. Concomitant treatment included calcium channel blockers, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, statins, and others. None of the patients had known cancer or systemic infections, and none were pregnant at the time of inclusion. With the exception of 1 patient, all were white. As disease controls, 29 white patients with SLE (4 of these were men) were included from another study14. The SLE samples were collected within a few months and were subsequently stored as citrated platelet-poor plasma at â€“80Â°C for about 3.5 years before being used in our present study. Finally, 40 unmedicated, healthy individuals (33 women and 7 men) with a median age of 46 years (range 24â€“71 yrs) were included as HC and sampled within a few weeks in 2 rounds (36 HC in the first round) separated by a year. All partici pants were included after giving written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (approval no. H-B-2008-131) and carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical, biochemical, and serological assessment. The clinical characteristics of the patient population are summarized in Table 1. Data on disease history including clinical, biochemical, and pharmacological data were obtained by review of medical records, patient examination, and interview. Subsequently, the data were registered in a database. Based on the extent of cutaneous involvement, patients were classified as having limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc; n = 79) or diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc; n = 41)17. Serological assessment of antinuclear antibodies, including anticentromere antibodies (ACA), was performed by indirect immunofluorescence on human epithelial type 2 cell line cells, and anti-Scl-70 antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA. Blood sampling and isolation of platelet-poor plasma. Venipuncture was performed using a 21-gauge needle, and after release of the tourniquet, the first tube obtained was always reserved for autoantibody analyses. Next, for microRNA analysis, the blood was collected into 3 Ã— 9 ml citrate tubes (Vacuette sodium citrate 3.8%; Greiner Bio-One) and gently mixed 5 times. Immediately after collection, the blood cells were removed by centrifugation. All samples underwent a 2-step centrifugation procedure: 1800 g, 10 min, 21Â°C, followed by centrifugation of the supernatant 3000 g, 10 min, 21Â°C to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP). The PPP was aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at â€“80Â°C until analysis. RNA isolation and miRNA profiling. Total RNA was purified from 100 Î¼l-citrated PPP samples using Norgen Total RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.), and a panel of miRNA was analyzed after reverse transcription using stem-loop primers, preamplification, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) using specific assays from Applied Biosystems.

The potential for practical utility caused an assessment of predictive potential across multiple world populations, with the goal of determining predictive ability for global health studies. 
 
A NAT2 genotype profile of 16 SNPs (including rs1041983 and rs1801280) were determined in 595 HapMap samples (59 Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU), 60 Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California (MEX), 90 Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB), 87 Chinese in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado (CHD), 91 Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT), 89 Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (LWK) and 119 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI)) using the AffymetrixÂ® DMETâ„¢ Plus genotyping platform [2]. The NAT2 haplotype pairs were then determined by these SNPs via DMET Console 1.0 [2]. According to the Consensus Human Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase Gene Nomenclature [3], the phenotype of NAT2 in HapMap samples was determined based on the haplotype. The genotype calls for tagSNP, rs1495741, was retrieved from the HAPMAP database release#28. Percent of agreement (concordance) and kappa statistics (percent of agreement above and beyond chance alone) were calculated for the genotype of rs1495741, 2-SNP (rs1041983 and rs1801280) and NAT2 haplotype predicted phenotype. Kappa=0.81 was considered as cutoff to evaluate rs1495741 and 2-SNP panel in this study. The value of area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was measured using SPSS Statistics software, version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). P<0.05 was considered as significance in this study. 
 
After merging genotype and haplotype data, totally 476 samples have tagSNP, 2-SNP genotype and haplotype data, thus inferred phenotype. Samples with unknown haplotypes (n=85, phase ambiguity can cause unknown haplotypes) or no calls in genotypes (n=4) were excluded in this study. 
 
The concordance rate between rs1495741 and the predicted phenotype is 91.4% (kappa=0.86, p<0.0001) (Table 1). This value was superior to the 2-SNP panel (concordance rate 87.0%, kappa=0.80, p<0.001). The AUC value of rs1495741 for the â€œslow acetylatorâ€ population was 0.96 (p<0.001). rs1495741 yield 92% sensitivity and 99% specificity in predicting NAT2 â€œSlow acetylatorâ€ phenotype (Table 2a). However, in 2-SNP panel, this value was 0.85(p<0.001) for â€œSlow acetylatorâ€ phenotype (Table 2b). Similar AUC values were seen for â€œintermediate and rapid acetylatorâ€ prediction with rs1495741 and the 2-SNP panel (Table 2). For specific populations, the discordance rate was 20.7% (kappa=0.63, p<0.0001) and 46% (kappa=0.25, p<0.0001) in Nigerians for rs1495741 and 2-SNP panel respectively (Table 3). In Kenyans, 12.7% (kappa=0.78, p<0.001) were miscalculated by rs1495741 and 30.2% (kappa=0.45, p<0.001) were miscalculated by 2-SNP panel. This value decreased significantly to 1.9%â€“6.8% (kappa range: 0.89â€“1, p<0.001) in Asian population (Table 3). Meantime, none of the Caucasian and Mexican populations were miscalculated by either panel.

In the study by Selinski et al, the 2-SNP panel outperformed rs1495741 for higher specificity and lower false discovery rate [1]. However, this was not replicated in our assessment, primarily due to miscalculation of the rapid phenotypes (*4/*13, *12/*13) as intermediate and intermediate phenotypes (*4/*5, *13/*14B, *6A/*13, *7/*13) as slow in 2-SNP panel. When break down our samples by population however, the 2-SNP panel did perform equally as rs1495741 for concordance rate in Caucasian and Mexican populations and better in Asian population. In Nigerians and Kenyans, poor concordance indicated that both tagSNP and 2-SNP panel may not be applicable markers for predicting NAT2 phenotypes in African populations.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yi Jing He"", ids = ""11975130""); list(name = ""Michael H.

2669198ab7e6cdbcb009f613a457daf0b6ada43b,White Matter Microstructural Integrity Is Associated with Executive Function and Processing Speed in Older Adults with Coronary Artery Disease.,"OBJECTIVE
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline. Although cerebral white matter (WM) damage predicts cognitive function in CAD, conventional neuroimaging measures only partially explain the effect of CAD on cognition. The purpose of this study was to determine if WM microstructural integrity and CAD using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) correlates with cognitive function in older adults with CAD.


METHODS
Forty-nine CAD patients (66 Â± 7 years old, 86% male) underwent neurocognitive assessments using the cognitive battery recommended by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network for the study of vascular cognitive impairment. Composite scores for each cognitive domain were calculated. Microstructural integrity in normal-appearing WM was quantified as fractional anisotropy (FA) using DTI in nine bilateral and two interhemispheric WM tracts from the Johns Hopkins University WM Tractography Atlas. Linear regression models examined associations between FA and cognitive performance, controlling for age, sex, and education, with correction for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 5%.


RESULTS
Executive function was most significantly associated with FA in the left parahippocampal cingulum (Î² = 0.471, t = 3.381, df = 44, p = 0.002) and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (Î² = 0.430, t = 2.984, df = 44, p = 0.005). FA was not associated with memory in any of the WM tracts examined.


CONCLUSION

91e7ebb24fdb95fd7efc5e80b16998986b13fca8,Title : Pulmonary transcriptome analysis in the rabbit model of surgically-induced diaphragmatic hernia treated with fetal tracheal occlusion,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a malformation leading to pulmonary hypoplasia which can be treated in utero by fetal tracheal occlusion (TO). However the changes of gene expression induced by TO remain largely unknown but could be used to further improve the clinically used prenatal treatment of this devastating malformation. Therefore we aimed to investigate the pulmonary transcriptome changes due to surgical induction of diaphragmatic hernia (DH) and additional tracheal occlusion in the fetal rabbit model. Induction of DH was associated with 378 up-regulated genes compared to controls when allowing a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 and a Fold Change (FC) of 2. Those genes were again down-regulated by consecutive TO. But DH+TO was associated with an up-regulation of 157 genes compared to DH and controls. When being compared to control lungs, 106 genes were down-regulated in the DH group and were not changed by TO. Therefore, the overall pattern of gene expression in DH+TO is more similar to the control group then to the DH group. In this study we further provide a database of gene expression changes induced by surgical creation of DH and consecutive TO in the rabbit model. Future treatment strategies could be developed using this dataset. We also discuss the most relevant genes that are involved in CDH.",2016,,"list(name = ""Alexander C.

c1e9071cb9dc134517fe56367e572e48752ff0f9,Genotype-ocular biometry correlation analysis of eight primary angle closure glaucoma susceptibility loci in a cohort from Northern China,"PURPOSE
Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have verified eight genetic loci that were significantly associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). The present study investigated whether these variants are associated with the ocular biometric parameters of anterior chamber depth (ACD) and axial length (AL) in a northern Chinese population, as well as whether there were differences in the association of genetic markers in our cohort based on ethnicity.


METHODS
A case-control association study of 500 patients and 720 controls was undertaken. All individuals were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs11024102 in PLEKHA7, rs3753841 in COL11A1, rs1015213 located between PCMTD1 and ST18, rs3816415 in EPDR1, rs1258267 in CHAT, rs736893 in GLIS3, rs7494379 in FERMT2, and rs3739821 mapping between DPM2 and FAM102A) using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique. Allelic and genotypic frequency differences were evaluated using a logistic regression model. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) analysis was conducted for association testing between genotypes and ocular biometric parameters. False discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was employed, and the statistical power was calculated via power and sample size calculation.


RESULTS
Four of the eight SNPs, rs3753841, rs1258267, rs736893 and rs7494379, were associated with PACG (p = 0.007, 0.0016, 0.0045, 0.045, respectively), and only rs3753841, rs1258267 and rs736893 surpassed the FDR correction. For subgroup analysis, only rs1258267 could withstand multiple testing correction in the Han nationality (p = 0.00571). In the GEE tests, rs3753841, rs1258267 and rs736893 were found to be nominally associated with ACD (p = 0.023, 0.016, 0.01, respectively). However, these associations could not survive FDR correction.


CONCLUSIONS
The SNP rs3753841 in COL11A1, rs1258267 in CHAT and rs736893 in GLIS3 are associated with PACG in northern Chinese people, and the association of genetic markers manifests a tendency of ethnic diversity. Larger population-based studies are warranted to reveal additional PACG loci and ethnic aspects of PACG.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wenjuan Zhuang"", ids = ""48780234""); list(name = ""Shaolin Wang"", ids = ""50695864""); list(name = ""Juan Hao"", ids = ""50202944""); list(name = ""Manyun Xu"", ids = ""81649149""); list(name = ""Hao Chi"", ids = ""47762217""); list(name = ""Shunyu Piao"", ids = ""152970054""); list(name = ""Jianâ\200\220qing Ma"", ids = ""27639770""); list(name = ""Xiaolong Zhang"", ids = ""46447020""); list(name = ""Shaoping Ha"", ids = ""4361202"")",659f03cc9b44c51eb7394a3c05a385a36212ff23,2fd7da0285f96522be1403149827523f619c5724; 1f4f4724c7604bff915326f2e268021156591b70; db743d63320190e00c0dbf69f03416f63a5652c4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ab879195b43681c3ad560d3bc3e43809b5f8bba4; 0152cb1d14d1d19a3cce1d153f4f35b202b27d2b; 6ef56b6cf22277eed2eb6792bcadc1e1f58ad08a; 5b903ae29e3b4a9499abcdb5732d38926744d81a; d44d6830dc387f46895ae036ee3dda3d974ae01a; cda5c18e461774589c8ff25db7079744e685d303; b697e88842491ee455eb62202495433193595391; b49caa46aa223d5443846adb65ccf2d0ceb9a729; b433a540554c4e18442b64780f63a83b8fe47f08; a5208fc9d4652b4fc8d7ba140035c73d249fccb5; 008951bfc113fb5bfb3b16672d4e8f63ea031db0; 741894ed465f982df4aadf97165ff293c464c297; 9a35459b506af7f6ee9d769ce910207d39b10a40; e83ef07f3648a8319fd02c13d825251e1520b6c6; bd43bdebabd74a5153a6a6487809f1d5a0b6be8f; b321c6d6059e448d85e8ffb5cb2318cf7f2e9ebc; 971d00a6b1fd98d892ef5e18fdc84fcdfed3fd18,PLoS ONE,13,
82012778c0f8dfd156078f413a02734456a33b78,Integrating interacting drugs and genetic variations to improve the predictability of warfarin maintenance dose in Chinese patients.,"OBJECTIVE
Compared with genetic factors, drug interactions are largely unexplored in pharmacogenetic studies. This study sought to systematically investigate the effects of VKORC1, STX4A, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, CYP3A4, and GGCX gene polymorphisms and interacting drugs on warfarin maintenance dose.


METHODS
A retrospective study of 845 Chinese patients after heart valve replacement receiving long-term warfarin maintenance therapy was conducted. Thirteen polymorphisms in the six genes were genotyped, and 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin were investigated.


RESULTS
Single-nucleotide polymorphism association analysis showed that VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP4F2 variations were highly associated with the warfarin maintenance dose. Among 36 drugs that may interact with warfarin, fluconazole, amiodarone, and omeprazole were associated with the requirement for 45.8, 16.7, and 16.7% lower median warfarin dose (all P<0.05 with a false discovery rate <0.05).

76425a67e910c030068128826e0531e9c1e5cdfb,Using random subspace method for prediction and variable importance assessment in linear regression,A random subset method (RSM) with a new weighting scheme is proposed and investigated for linear regression with a large number of features. Weights of variables are defined as averages of squared values of pertaining t-statistics over fitted models with randomly chosen features. It is argued that such weighting is advisable as it incorporates two factors: a measure of importance of the variable within the considered model and a measure of goodness-of-fit of the model itself. Asymptotic weights assigned by such a scheme are determined as well as assumptions under which the method leads to consistent choice of significant variables in the model. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method behaves promisingly when its prediction errors are compared with errors of penalty-based methods such as the lasso and it has much smaller false discovery rate than the other methods considered.,2014,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jan Mielniczuk"", ids = ""144134946""); list(name = ""Pawel Teisseyre"", ids = ""2889155"")",abf7b601f4ddd9e152aac38e55d922baa1f98bd0; b0153ed4dff5c0fea476dab1e4959dd2c9a673b7; fe005870bbdd93e24775943fa037b8073d0b537c; 85f2b07a0c842a3b44da549dc6d16f1db48520ac,a14f723938c3a39bebb67b2d561faddb1a61aa3b; b44f973e2652e4450ce4b50f3e4912e33189a08d; b9edea795d66a977c708b9403f41f298cbb69f2e; 20659b92bbd3ee62458f255a92a067e7df898a11; 02e7563c0a8d5cbbb0dc9a1ef3c1d2abbe5f1470; 4589d4c3bfe8ce109733074a69a33b082912205f; b3f8c18fb9c961618bd90d440f1a20175827e418; 242e18e7c5bbcd1bfc63c89d9e086a7340ab4177; 66a4f6ea5ceb8b58e84877638a5ee6d4b3dcfc8c; 54640fee343323a53c034a50f261d79c3ea8c584; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; bf48afa4422fc02c0d07bbbf262cb8254a365359; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; e0149f4926373368a0d88f7fb57c5549500fd83a; 6c96bcc3fdb93be81af58ea369109bf8664156ca; a2bcf51c099873d7b85c76e4f76189fe6006fadc; d2875bbe455ba8aa21c0f06f6f1ee42c7269d7ad; 4f7749b21e0721cde4cad83cd276dc7eb6fb4e21; f8bab7397c3f70a7077a6cd0cb2626804ad3848d; b41d0fa5fdaadd47fc882d3db04277d03fb21832; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; 09abb14214179888c135110203efe08b9da8b576,Comput.

To determine mechanisms fueling this expansion, gene expression data were gathered by microarray analysis of cells from CLL patients. Samples were grouped based on Ki-67 expression, an indicator of proliferation. To determine mechanisms correlating with B-cell proliferation and impacting on CLL B-cell biology, microarray profiles were compared using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [Subramanian A, et al . PNAS 2005]. Methods: Samples were analyzed for intracellular expression of Ki-67 by flow cytometry and divided into 2 groups based on Ki-67 expression (cutoff at 5%). RNA was then purified from CD5 + CD19 + CLL cells and gene expression microarray assays were performed using Illumina HumanHT12 beadchips. GSEA was carried out using a library of signatures by Dr. Louis Staudt [Shaffer AL, et al . Immunol Rev 2006] containing 305 gene sets encompassing 13, 564 genes biased towards hematopoietic signatures. Results: Of 61 cases, 14 were Ki-67 high and 47 were Ki-67 low . When time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) was compared between the groups, Ki67 high patients had significantly shorter TTFT (2.76 yrs) compared to Ki-67 low patients (23.46 yrs; P high group with 50 gene sets significantly enriched at a false discovery rate (FDR) low group, 30/285 gene sets were upregulated with only one significant at FDR IGHV unmutated CLL (U-CLL) was enriched in only one gene set, termed CLLUNMUT-1, while mutated CLL (M-CLL) was only enriched in CLLMUT-1. CD38 high and CD38 low subsets were similarly enriched in these two gene sets, with 4 additional gene sets in the CD38 high group, including MYD88UP-4 and IFN-2. Of the 50 significantly enriched gene sets in the Ki-67 high group, 17 relate to signaling pathways, 16 to cellular differentiation, 6 to cellular processes, 4 to transcription factor targets, and the remaining 7 relate to cancer. Of these, the percentage of the signaling component is up 13% from its representation in the original Staudt library. The top 5 gene sets enriched in the Ki-67 high group are: upregulated U-CLL compared to M-CLL (CLLUNMUT-1), myeloid tissue compared to other tissues (MYELOID-1), T cell cytokine induced proliferation (TCYTUP-8), BCR crosslinking CLL B cells (CLLBCRUP-1) and BDCA4+ dendritic cells compared to other hematopoietic cells (DC-1). The total number of genes enriched in these 50 sets is 769, with 217 genes shared in two or more gene sets. Twenty genes were enriched in the CLL BCR signature, CLLBCRUP-1 [Herishanu Y, et al . Blood 2011]. Of these, WARS, IRF4, MX1, OAS1, and NAMPT are also enriched in the T cell cytokine induced and T cell activation signatures. Only one gene set was enriched in the Ki-67 low group, CLLMUT-1, upregulated in M-CLL compared to U-CLL. CD274 (PD-L1) was consistently elevated in the Ki-67 low group in all the patients, irrespective of IGHV mutation status. Discussion: The observed GSEA profiles in Ki-67 high patients correlated with gene signatures biased towards BCR signaling, signal transduction, and hematopoietic cancer, consistent with the Ki-67 high group containing more (recently) proliferating cells influenced at least in part by BCR signaling. The profiles also suggest that additional cells (T lymphocytes and dendritic cells) may be involved. It is notable these gene sets were not observed for CLL patients subgrouped by IGHV mutation status or by CD38, and that these other subsets did not show as pronounced a distinction by GSEA profiling.

They are splicing-generated, widely expressed in various tissues and have functional implications in development and diseases. To facilitate genome-wide characterization of circRNAs using RNA-Seq data, we present a freely available software package named acfs. Acfs allows de novo, accurate and fast identification and abundance quantification of circRNAs from single- and paired-ended RNA-Seq data. On simulated datasets, acfs achieved the highest F1 accuracy and lowest false discovery rate among current state-of-the-art tools. On real-world datasets, acfs efficiently identified more bona fide circRNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the power of circRNA analysis on two leukemia datasets. We identified a set of circRNAs that are differentially expressed between AML and APL samples, which might shed light on the potential molecular classification of complex diseases using circRNA profiles. Moreover, chromosomal translocation, as manifested in numerous diseases, could produce not only fusion transcripts but also fusion circRNAs of clinical relevance. Featured with high accuracy, low FDR and the ability to identify fusion circRNAs, we believe that acfs is well suited for a wide spectrum of applications in characterizing the landscape of circRNAs from non-model organisms to cancer biology.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xintian You"", ids = ""46691460""); list(name = ""Tim O.

Data were gathered from 72,435 women. A total of 1,495 (2.1%) women reported having BED symptoms both before and during pregnancy; 921 (1.3%) reported pre-pregnancy BED symptoms that remitted during pregnancy; 1,235 (1.7%) reported incident BED symptoms during pregnancy; and 68,784 (95.0%) reported no eating disorder symptoms before or during pregnancy (referent).


MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
Questionnaires were collected at 3 time points, with a median completion time of 17.1 weeks gestation, 30.1 weeks gestation, and 18.7 months after childbirth. We collected information on demographics, eating disorder status before and during pregnancy, sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy, hours of sleep during the third trimester, and sleep satisfaction 18 months after childbirth. All BED symptom groups were significantly more likely to report sleep problems during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy than the referent (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.26-1.42, false discovery rate [FDR] P < 0.05). In the third trimester, women with incident BED symptoms during pregnancy were more likely to report more hours of sleep than the referent (adjusted OR = 1.49, FDR P < 0.01). All BED symptom groups had higher odds of reporting more dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth (adjusted ORs = 1.28-1.47, FDR P < 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
BED before or during pregnancy is associated with sleeping problems during pregnancy and dissatisfaction with sleep 18 months after childbirth. Health care professionals should inquire about BED during pregnancy as it may be associated with sleep disturbances, in addition to the hallmark eating concerns.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""T Frances Ulman"", ids = ""4001974""); list(name = ""Ann F Von Holle"", ids = ""6269713""); list(name = ""Leila Torgersen"", ids = ""1881845""); list(name = ""Camilla Stoltenberg"", ids = ""5550931""); list(name = ""Ted Reichborn-Kjennerud"", ids = ""1398011885""); list(name = ""Cynthia M.

Since 2004, the suicide rate among US Army soldiers has exceeded the rate of death from combat injury. It is critical to establish factors that increase the risk of acting on suicidal thoughts to guide early intervention and suicide prevention.


Objective
To assess whether firearm ownership, use, storage practices, and accessibility are associated with increased risk of suicide.


Design, Setting, and Participants
In this case-control study, suicide cases (nâ€‰=â€‰135) were defined as US Army soldiers who died by suicide while on active duty between August 1, 2011, and November 1, 2013. Next-of-kin and Army supervisors of soldiers who died by suicide (nâ€‰=â€‰168) were compared with propensity-matched controls (nâ€‰=â€‰137); those soldiers with a suicidal ideation in the past year (nâ€‰=â€‰118) provided structured interview data. Data were analyzed from April 5, 2018, to April 2, 2019.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Firearm ownership, storage, and accessibility were assessed by using items from the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview screening scales along with items created for the purpose of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) study.


Results
Among the 135 suicide decedents, next-of-kin reported that they had greater accessibility to firearms compared with propensity-matched controls. Specifically, suicide decedents were more likely to own 1 or more handguns compared with propensity-matched controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.7; Ï‡21â€‰=â€‰4.2; false discovery rate [FDR] Pâ€‰=â€‰.08), store a loaded gun at home (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1; Ï‡21â€‰=â€‰12.2; FDR Pâ€‰=â€‰.003), and publicly carry a gun when not required for military duty (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.3; Ï‡21â€‰=â€‰7.4; FDR Pâ€‰=â€‰.02). The combination of these 3 items was associated with a 3-fold increase in the odds of suicide death (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-9.4; Ï‡21â€‰=â€‰5.4; FDR Pâ€‰=â€‰.05). Storing a loaded gun with ammunition at home or publicly carrying a gun when not on duty was associated with a 4-fold increase in the odds of suicide death (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.9-7.9; Ï‡21â€‰=â€‰14.1; FDR Pâ€‰=â€‰.002).


Conclusions and Relevance
In this study, in addition to gun ownership, ease and immediacy of firearm access were associated with increased suicide risk. Discussion with family members and supervisors about limiting firearm accessibility should be evaluated for potential intervention.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Catherine L.

S. mutans, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Veilonella, Bifidobacterium, and other bacteria play important roles in root caries biofilm. Yeasts are also present on carious and non-carious root biofilms, being the specie Candida albicans the most prevalent yeast found in root biofilms. Although the presence of Candida albicans is stablished in the literature, and there are an increasing gradient of Candida species. colonization with caries progression, the role of this microorganism in root caries has not being totally elucidated. The aim of this study is to analyse the role of Candida albicans in root caries thought a transcriptomic analysis of biofilms of sound root surfaces (n=10, SRS) and root caries lesions (n=9, RC) using a highthroughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-Seq). The differential expression of genes of Candida albicans SC5314, the specific functions and pathways associated with the gene expression of the present study were investigated. The total bacterial RNA was extracted and the mRNA was isolated (Illumina Hi-Seq2500). Samples with low RNA concentration (less than 30ng/RNA) were pooled, yielding a final sample size of SRS=10 and RC=9. Sequence reads were compiled in a count table and mapped to C. albicans SC5314 genome of reference, using the software CLC Genomics Workbench 7.5.1. Gene expression was calculated in the algorithm DESeq, and the differential expression was calculated with binomial negative (Log2FoldChange) and False Discovery Rate (FDR<0,05). The genes with higher expression in RC and SRS were analysed by the Relative Median Expression (RME), and the virulence factors and pathways and sugar metabolization related with Candida albicans pathogenicity in root caries were analysed. Two genes (CaO19.610, FDR=0.009; CaO19.2506, FDR=0.018) are up-regulated in Sound Root Surface (SRS) have their functions related to biofilm formation and seven (UTP20, FDR=0.018; ITR1, FDR=0.036; DHN6, FDR=0.046; CaO19.7197, FDR=0.046; CaO19.7838, FDR=0.046; STT4, FDR=0.046; GUT1, FDR=0.046) are up-regulated in biofilm of carious dentin (RC) have functions related to metabolic activity, sugar transport, stress tolerance, invasion and pH regulation.

To test the hypothesis that different allergens elicit symptoms of asthma via different effector pathways, gene expression was compared in lungs of Balb/c mice sensitized with either TMA or OVA, followed by intratracheal challenge with TMA conjugated to mouse serum albumin (TMA-MSA) or OVA, respectively. Sensitized animals challenged with mouse serum albumin (MSA) alone were controls. Seventy-two hours after challenge, lung eosinophil peroxidase indicated that both allergens caused the same significant change in eosinophilia. Total RNA was isolated from lung lobes of 6-8 animals in each of four treatment groups and hybridized to Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips. False discovery rates (q-values) were calculated from an overall F test to identify candidate genes with differences in expression for the four groups. Using a q-value cutoff of 0.1, 853 probe sets had significantly different expression across the four treatment groups. Of these 853 probe sets, 376 genes had an Experimental/Control ratio of greater than 1.2 or less than 1/1.2 for either OVA- or TMA-treated animals, and 249 of the 376 genes were uniquely up- or down-regulated for OVA or TMA (i.e., differentially expressed with the allergen). qRT-PCR analysis of selected transcripts confirmed the gene expression analysis. Increases in both arginase transcript and enzyme activity were significantly greater in OVA-induced asthma compared to TMA-induced asthma. These data suggest that pathways of arginine metabolism and the importance of nitric oxide may differ in OVA- and TMA-induced asthma.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Amy L Greene"", ids = ""36679194""); list(name = ""Mark Rutherford"", ids = ""145871652""); list(name = ""R.

A review of the works where the methods of testing the directional hypotheses are given can be found, for example, in [2,3]. Bayesian decision theoretical methodology for testing the directional hypotheses was developed and compared with the frequents method in [2]. While a new approach to the statistical hypotheses testing, called Constrained Bayesian Methods (CBM), was developed and applied alongside to other types of hypotheses to the directional hypotheses in [3]. One specific aspect of CBM for testing directional hypotheses, in particular, the fact that it restricts both the mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR) and total Type III error rate is proved below.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kj Kachiashvili"", ids = ""104018678"")",,cabb1225ad31def95457f0df9f98e28552a02cc2; d25618e32cc56b98ca44002a8033fd071169dcd5; 25e237a07f68b1a96555f8589840f8ac22e1fcc1; 99588d9cc15c06f1245b4fd0005381c2ae0bcd2d; 6700ec196206a044afa428e6b9a5fd7140311a2f; 3b973d43f3621d91a9b79e1e5ed82e6d0a82eb18; af3256bde1713e64fcf8fdd0cad4fcd0e44d47ce; 06e016d4392809aef493f4a02c5b00df9a68ebb7; 56a5cf00ecb5da85124d42487d5e1d4630039fe5; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; b8147d854763b56512bffb769cfbf969b0d77ab7,Biomedical Journal of Scientific and Technical Research,2,001-003
7fbc6b5f99956d25b807c7851dd44482e81a7ac9,RT-SVR+q: a strategy for post-Mascot analysis using retention time and q value metric to improve peptide and protein identifications.,"Shotgun proteomics commonly utilizes database search like Mascot to identify proteins from tandem MS/MS spectra. False discovery rate (FDR) is often used to assess the confidence of peptide identifications. However, a widely accepted FDR of 1% sacrifices the sensitivity of peptide identification while improving the accuracy. This article details a machine learning approach combining retention time based support vector regressor (RT-SVR) with q value based statistical analysis to improve peptide and protein identifications with high sensitivity and accuracy. The use of confident peptide identifications as training examples and careful feature selection ensures high R values (>0.900) for all models. The application of RT-SVR model on Mascot results (p=0.10) increases the sensitivity of peptide identifications. q Value, as a function of deviation between predicted and experimental RTs (Î”RT), is used to assess the significance of peptide identifications. We demonstrate that the peptide and protein identifications increase by up to 89.4% and 83.5%, respectively, for a specified q value of 0.01 when applying the method to proteomic analysis of the natural killer leukemia cell line (NKL). This study establishes an effective methodology and provides a platform for profiling confident proteomes in more relevant species as well as a future investigation of accurate protein quantification.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Weifeng Cao"", ids = ""47416061""); list(name = ""Di Ma"", ids = ""49626626""); list(name = ""Arvinder K Kapur"", ids = ""3622330""); list(name = ""Manish S Patankar"", ids = ""5210280""); list(name = ""Yadi Ma"", ids = ""2630572""); list(name = ""Lingjun Li"", ids = ""145180832"")",fc8063601983473e305dc4e45850c873a1384e10; 3c7f168a7cf8180e836b18a5486a35066e115761; 1b5956c15c74afead17633e3ee85479f608ad35e,,Journal of proteomics,75 2,"

Steps ranging from the preparation of total proteins, digestion of proteins to peptides, and separation of peptides by two-dimensional (1. strong cation exchange and 2. reversed-phase) high performance liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry and data processing have been optimized for our instrumentation platform. Using this technology, we identify ca. 3400 proteins per sample and have identified an estimated 4600 proteins in vegetative cells (equal to ca. 90% of the predicted S. pombe proteome) at a false discovery rate of 0.02. Considering the fact that approximately 500 genes are strongly induced during sexual differentiation, and sexual differentiation was not included in our experiments, the proteomic profiling technique affords what should be virtually complete coverage of the vegetative S. pombe proteome. In addition, these methods are widely applicable, having been used for proteomic profiling of several other organisms.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Laurence M.

We used a second generation 384-SNP array enriched with candidate genes for growth and wood properties to genotype mother trees collected in 20 natural populations covering most of the European distribution of the species. Phenotypic data for total height, polycyclism, root-collar diameter and biomass were obtained from a replicated provenance-progeny trial located in two sites with contrasting environments (Atlantic vs Mediterranean climate). General linear models identified strong associations between growth traits (total height and polycyclism) and four SNPs from the korrigan candidate gene, after multiple testing corrections using false discovery rate. The combined genomic breeding value predictions assessed for the four associated korrigan SNPs by ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) and cross-validation accounted for up to 8 and 15% of the phenotypic variance for height and polycyclic growth, respectively, and did not improve adding SNPs from other growth-related candidate genes. For root-collar diameter and total biomass, they accounted for 1.6 and 1.1% of the phenotypic variance, respectively, but increased to 15 and 4.1% when other SNPs from lp3.1, lp3.3 and cad were included in RR-BLUP models.

cc24b6d83fc96ff7b29407c7dfbabae94558f7fb,"The allele-specific probe and primer amplification assay, a new real-time PCR method for fine quantification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in pooled DNA.","The evolution of fungicide resistance within populations of plant pathogens must be monitored to develop management strategies. Such monitoring often is based on microbiological tests, such as microtiter plate assays. Molecular monitoring methods can be considered if the mutations responsible for resistance have been identified. Allele-specific real-time PCR approaches, such as amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR and mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) PCR, are, despite their moderate efficacy, among the most precise methods for refining SNP quantification. We describe here a new real-time PCR method, the allele-specific probe and primer amplification assay (ASPPAA PCR). This method makes use of mixtures of allele-specific minor groove binder (MGB) TaqMan probes and allele-specific primers for the fine quantification of SNPs from a pool of DNA extracted from a mixture of conidia. It was developed for a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is responsible for resistance to the sterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicide fenhexamid, resulting in the replacement of the phenylalanine residue (encoded by the TTC codon) in position 412 of the enzymatic target (3-ketoreductase) by a serine (TCC), valine (GTC), or isoleucine (ATC) residue. The levels of nonspecific amplification with the ASPPAA PCR were reduced at least four times below the level of currently available allele-specific real-time PCR approaches due to strong allele specificity in amplification cycles, including two allele selectors. This new method can be used to quantify a complex quadriallelic SNP in a DNA pool with a false discovery rate of less than 1%.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexis Billard"", ids = ""14918841""); list(name = ""ValÃ©rie Laval"", ids = ""49618975""); list(name = ""Sabine Fillinger"", ids = ""6773227""); list(name = ""P.

3c046c8225767e8c903196f10ac4611ba005d2d1,Effects of dependence in high-dimensional multiple testing problems,"BackgroundWe consider effects of dependence among variables of high-dimensional data in multiple hypothesis testing problems, in particular the False Discovery Rate (FDR) control procedures. Recent simulation studies consider only simple correlation structures among variables, which is hardly inspired by real data features. Our aim is to systematically study effects of several network features like sparsity and correlation strength by imposing dependence structures among variables using random correlation matrices.ResultsWe study the robustness against dependence of several FDR procedures that are popular in microarray studies, such as Benjamin-Hochberg FDR, Storey's q-value, SAM and resampling based FDR procedures. False Non-discovery Rates and estimates of the number of null hypotheses are computed from those methods and compared. Our simulation study shows that methods such as SAM and the q-value do not adequately control the FDR to the level claimed under dependence conditions. On the other hand, the adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg procedure seems to be most robust while remaining conservative. Finally, the estimates of the number of true null hypotheses under various dependence conditions are variable.ConclusionWe discuss a new method for efficient guided simulation of dependent data, which satisfy imposed network constraints as conditional independence structures. Our simulation set-up allows for a structural study of the effect of dependencies on multiple testing criterions and is useful for testing a potentially new method on Ï€0 or FDR estimation in a dependency context.",2007,Computer Science;

a9778d6907b598af6cce7e798d9744e6f1211e5a,Association study and mutation analysis of adiponectin shows association of variants in APM1 with complex obesity in women.,"We performed an association study and mutation analysis of the adiponectin (APM1) gene to study its involvement in the development of obesity. We also studied the interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). 223 obese women and 87 healthy female control subjects were used for association analysis. Mutation analysis was done on 95 morbidly obese adults and 123 overweight and obese children and adolescents. We selected 6 haplotype tagging SNPs in APM1 and the Pro12Ala variant (rs1805192) in PPARgamma to study the interaction. The G allele of rs2241766 was more common in controls (cases 10.8% vs. controls 18.4%, nominal p = 0.011; OR = 0.57, nominal p = 0.018). The rs2241766/rs3774261 haplotype was also associated with obesity (nominal p = 0.004). Only the latter association remained significant after controlling for the False Discovery Rate. Resequencing of exon 2, exon 3 and intron 2 in 95 individuals did not reveal any SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2241766. No interaction with the Pro12Ala variant in PPARgamma was detected. Mutation analysis of APM1 did not identify mutations. In conclusion, we found an association of an APM1 haplotype with obesity and found that APM1 mutations are not a common cause of monogenic obesity in our cohort.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sigri Beckers"", ids = ""21762294""); list(name = ""Armand V Peeters"", ids = ""114368508""); list(name = ""Fenna de Freitas"", ids = ""47293087""); list(name = ""Ilse L.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown, particularly in humans. We used a novel high-throughput molecular assay (SOMAscan v3.0, SomaLogic Inc., Boulder, CO) to characterize the effects of age and regular AE on the plasma proteome of healthy adult humans. From 1129 analytes, the expression of 48 proteins was greater and 37 lower in older (O; 64Â±6 yr; n=16) vs. young (Y; 24Â±4 yr; n=16) healthy men (false discovery rate [FDR] < 15%, p<0.01). Expression of the non-collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) protein dermatopontin was greater in O vs. Y (P=0.007), but was lower in older AE-trained men (63Â±7 yr; n=8; VO2max = 49.6Â±3.7 mL/kgâ‹…min) compared with their sedentary counterparts (VO2max = 27.4Â±2.4 mL/kgâ‹…min) (FDR < 1.28%, p<0.001).

Here, we report an association analysis in 63,746 CAD cases and 130,681 controls identifying 15 loci reaching genome-wide significance, taking the number of susceptibility loci for CAD to 46, and a further 104 independent variants (r2 < 0.2) strongly associated with CAD at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Together, these variants explain approximately 10.6% of CAD heritability. Of the 46 genome-wide significant lead SNPs, 12 show a significant association with a lipid trait, and 5 show a significant association with blood pressure, but none is significantly associated with diabetes. Network analysis with 233 candidate genes (loci at 10% FDR) generated 5 interaction networks comprising 85% of these putative genes involved in CAD. The four most significant pathways mapping to these networks are linked to lipid metabolism and inflammation, underscoring the causal role of these activities in the genetic etiology of CAD.

f08d7220aa6a41765cabf7b99aae55d6751b4ab2,Identification of a 3.7-Mb region for a marbling QTL on bovine chromosome 4 by identical-by-descent and association analysis.,"QTL mapping for growth and carcass traits was performed using a paternal half-sib family composed of 325 Japanese Black cattle offspring. Nine QTL were detected at the 1% chromosome-wise significance level at a false discovery rate of less than 0.1. These included two QTL for marbling on BTA 4 and 18, two QTL for carcass weight on BTA 14 and 24, two QTL for longissimus muscle area on BTA 1 and 4, two QTL for subcutaneous fat thickness on BTA 1 and 15 and one QTL for rib thickness on BTA 6. Although the marbling QTL on BTA 4 has been replicated with significant linkages in two Japanese Black cattle sires, the three Q (more marbling) haplotypes, each inherited maternally, were apparently different. To compare the three Q haplotypes in more detail, high-density microsatellite markers for the overlapping regions were developed within the 95% CIs (65 markers in 44-78 cM). A detailed haplotype comparison indicated that a small region (<3.7 Mb) around 46 cM was shared between the Qs of the two sires, whose dams were related. An association of this region with marbling was shown by a regression analysis using the local population, in which the two sires were produced and this was confirmed by an association study using a population collected throughout Japan. These results strongly suggest that the marbling QTL on BTA 4 is located in the 3.7-Mb region at around 46 cM.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kou Yokouchi"", ids = ""46596386""); list(name = ""Yasushi Mizoguchi"", ids = ""48086606""); list(name = ""Takeshi Watanabe"", ids = ""150340240""); list(name = ""Eiko Iwamoto"", ids = ""47682549""); list(name = ""Yoshikazu Sugimoto"", ids = ""48654741""); list(name = ""Akiko Takasuga"", ids = ""4369718"")",a5252f94c34dd6b8b2a9607634e1134eb4ca34f7; 2095e79aca9b7c013c778a7a091377995de85d43; 4263306d666a2eb221c908b268af70835e284c25; 798bc65385478734f79f5e1c1d7b305821fa00ac; 63fc786cca36233410d911a097819e53fe9c60ff; eb6d7e7bef6a15d099ede16f6756e6610033f6e1; 43645a1956856b52c59f8bed6268764fad493867; 28f3bbca95b6648f32f0389938fc7ac060b1d50c,12f0057261b2628e0bb003f8450460d5b3919685; 353f182346d455ccee6bb14fb9d076dd9cc10781; 82f9f6f837ceb631781e7c67c3acbcde2047db06; b005f19ae59ac22cebf055dda61f50bfb1c19d25; b0622f9c37469d80c5fb55dc91163171734ddf87; ae8d10c5f5f83d5dd197e2038bbc5283c50bbc59; fe5efa6e1653c1c74f83400ab0df46a2f0beb1f3; c22670c927422963c4157cc7fac574a00fbd1372; 03a7247f5ad4cc11c2fcb248f3557f7526d3a39b; 6da44a11983f5a8c6113125ecefde55d4be46a0e; 4a2f1e39c41d160bee2810b66d15f619141f0578; f5681c8797dba0cd2877103719c002321a6e743e; a5cc9167a92578f3a80d10468251ad69153382f9; d2fecf6eeac1d2e2fc2287f73d97e9837dba275a; e3d531fcf4ef7815e41958293ee7734428610a0a; 5b6b9ce0b428f1688b31766fa32aa73214626213; 91e74d77f079edecc82e724cad1b18738f0c6d2b; 938822b6261431ebfd299d9c38dca4c26a781aed; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6,Animal genetics,40 6,"

9b6369c48dd41e3485b66501dcc8796b95b159c9,TagDustâ€”a program to eliminate artifacts from next generation sequencing data,"MOTIVATION
Next-generation parallel sequencing technologies produce large quantities of short sequence reads. Due to experimental procedures various types of artifacts are commonly sequenced alongside the targeted RNA or DNA sequences. Identification of such artifacts is important during the development of novel sequencing assays and for the downstream analysis of the sequenced libraries.


RESULTS
Here we present TagDust, a program identifying artifactual sequences in large sequencing runs. Given a user-defined cutoff for the false discovery rate, TagDust identifies all reads explainable by combinations and partial matches to known sequences used during library preparation. We demonstrate the quality of our method on sequencing runs performed on Illumina's Genome Analyzer platform.

9ffc37a0d74af3b29d3affea40e6484c5cda8f47,TIA Biomarkers Determined Through Proteomics (S30.002),"Background: One of the â€œholy grailsâ€ in vascular neurology is a TIA serum marker. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a unique, unbiased method to identify candidate proteins, was used to test the serum of patients with transient neurologic symptoms for biomarkers of cerebral ischemia.
Methods: Patients with transient neurologic symptoms were prospectively enrolled. Mass spectrometry was performed on the serum samples, and results were searched against the Human Uniport database. Three candidate proteins were found, and serum concentrations of these proteins were measured by ELISA in a second cohort of prospectively enrolled patients. The studentâ€™s t-test was used for comparison. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure for multiple comparison adjustments determined significance for the proteomic screen.
Results: Patients with TIA (n=20), minor stroke (n=15), and controls (i.e. migraine, seizure, n=12) were enrolled in the first cohort. Ceruloplasmin, complement component C8 gamma (C8Î³) and platelet basic protein (PBP) were significantly different between the ischemic samples (TIA and minor stroke) and the controls (p = 0.0001, p=0.00027, p=0.00105 respectively). A second cohort of patients with TIA (n=21), minor stroke (n=20), and controlsâ€™ (n=12) serum was tested. PBP serum concentrations were increased in the ischemic samples compared to control (for TIA and stroke, p= 0.046, for TIA alone, p=0.019). Ceruloplasmin trended towards increased concentrations in the ischemic groups (p=0.127), and an insignificant increase in C8Î³ (p=0.44) was found.
Conclusions: PBP has been identified as potential serum biomarker for TIA. Larger sample size may find that ceruloplasmin is an additional candidate. Ultimately, a panel of proteins may be required. Larger studies are needed to determine the validity of these proteins in clinical use. Disclosure: Dr. George has nothing to disclose. Dr. Mlynash has nothing to disclose.

d14f014b8ff71e247d582e39260da51cebe97277,Genetic diversity and population structure of the roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus Heckel) inferred from microsatellite analyses: implications for its conservation and management,"Identification of population units is crucial for management and monitoring programs, especially for endangered wild species. The roughskin sculpin (Trachidermus fasciatus Heckel) is a small catadromous fish and has been listed as a second class state protected aquatic animal since 1988 in China. To achieve sustainable conservation of this species, it is necessary to clarify the existing genetic structure both between and within populations. Here, population genetic structure among eight populations of T. fasciatus were analyzed by using 16 highly polymorphic microsatellites. High levels of genetic variation were observed in all populations. All pairwise FST estimates were significant after false discovery rate correction (overall average FSTÂ =Â 0.054). Furthermore, both STRUCTURE and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) analysis showed that the eight populations were grouped into six clusters. BAYESASS analysis showed generally low recent and asymmetric migration among populations. All these results suggested significant genetic structure across populations. However, there was no isolation by distance relationship among populations, likely resulting from barriers to gene flow created by habitat fragmentation. Our results highlight the need for in situ conservation efforts for T. fasciatus across its entire distribution range, through maximizing habitat size and quality to preserve overall genetic diversity and evolutionary potential.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Yu-Long Li"", ids = ""36790911""); list(name = ""Dong-xiu Xue"", ids = ""6559665""); list(name = ""Tian-xiang Gao"", ids = ""152771955""); list(name = ""Jin-Xian Liu"", ids = ""6982973"")",749e9cdf1ce2120ece298eb579c33015c551dddd; d119deabc9fbb53b873b1c3fe29c5800b4822abb; f33ed87fb3fff730c8b85a86b141dc1448ae5336,a125ca2e8595108356f687cfd4933f0a9e5aad01; fa02f9123abacd5ba13d41e937d99c077da8d3f6; c3dd19499e58360b5c6f9255218dea17442ccf43; 01d1ccfc9b547a4de6f4b3b3ff77a8efda6d2c9d; 97009659427c57d581215f58dead922b0328c345; ec29f8fee9a6ff10da846aefbbcfe38cac5cc85a; b91a36398ebe174f4044eb88debb2c26a335fd33; 21898b43e892a6002c104b2f4ecdf32b4a1878f0; a7710d6326131f0160961019e48f2c08ea2dca36; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f91e7654d1424954705d09f80d749e02a719aad1; d07e265b685269dd2d324246525edc77db5d441e; 4fd48b8b3cb4c87c44d7c3ef3112f73566dcc666; b2eb7a241de6972d0735e4ea72f562e75757bbf6; 4fe635e93839ce8cf8fd92f55aa2888e9e8e0203; 2105987a79b1b926b6a5e920be64f0e58b592b22; db9b4ce238d6e58d474968effd054e4047540e59; 9e26ba560aca4e048069b14d98b5e3bfbde79309; bf137b4c40a58d08ed9afa18f9e7e49adf06345a; 4ff08908493ddffb0b2582eb059c97a5788aa5f8; 905d0bc73e16f1ff0c3db6129d1c157783f78b1a; e15a00f53b36335f3c3c709ae978b1a78aab51b2; 8fe38f23535f5f150d2d7100f1e0203552f8e28e; 11200f3eef606ae8eef67212a483a6feca8aaf92; f5a064f6fbadebe1ac92a1681fbad60d15cb8a98; df9e8162b4d8352ce20e35dd93baa1e14fd61e2f; 30f11868dfec0a49428a170629cd35562fb6ec09; 0a9879ea26e1ae40ef19fadd60fa318ce5876c0e; de4ed573b21f601d4be174543d6d42edf1212204; 1c891b8da3fe11497f812aa7e790c3c8d012a8f6; 8b7849629e70d9a904da125cf30b3abb2b7e70cd; 63c509dda4a99982538295402d60d21e863ded64; 02faea095e159fda90a394c38874ba761770cb32; 257a20e5d5e46fb77efb206cb9d01293a762bd2e; d949b157515c3789cea06c8a9b3cd8fe269a3216; 46e3a229d170207f0732d6b4c4c490b59d31a498; df53c968463e2991cb20fe555c07588910697f6a; 2e3ec549d4d700b156be021132d8a34aa1fe52e0; 1b7d6d3f0893be1a9076494765ea056c97c1bcae; 1eafe092a6845b07323ced13d09c09e5468997f0; e2019fc51d7caaf6ce38cecdedf13793ca566171; f0d4f573e161ae4ed970268422e5bfb9f8c0d75d; 851f7a70f2e8d78aba5bf11b77dfe4d56d48cdae; 5dc6a83189eb3f49d3887d2d28ada3bf1ebabd57; 2de8d6db6a3387f6124feaffbc241852ee10b6b7; ae3b894874514b369176f6100c22d2259fe34cab; 6879ce9fc9f70d582e407c464ad194cb0e51272a; d7ce6b0d1802cf3bd1def0b0360bcc4f86a0e4d8; adfe3078c2b6239e6dfce6d3547e751a5a6c421e; fcaa03f04ffb6c4ea8f3195aa886c6d30b9d37f2; da6dc57b145cf18a3186e0cb026e4ef78f070cd2; a397bbc859456dc25e3638279d684ff8db0bd928; 9c4fb83f9c95c677ca5fa7e478de438b733a002d; 9ead28b73dc3c2329ee2db668f288636b2870196; 439b31e129771af42410f1bb21e3ee7be0d71015; 81b824176ffe89ed577f09f40f5f6b292ab4f469; 46bc7b8127efe7f456098da7c9c24862adcf45fb; 9120b1b677a158988bb93225b55392e2517c455d; 63aea0cacc8de43621045e5251653e78793f244d,Conservation Genetics,17,921-930
b50169abd458fe2af92033d9a0d1227fd45ef3b6,Application of Haralick texture features in brain [18F]-florbetapir positron emission tomography without reference region normalization,"Objectives
Semi-quantitative image analysis methods in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) require normalization of positron emission tomography (PET) images. However, recent studies have found variabilities associated with reference region selection of amyloid PET images. Haralick features (HFs) generated from the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) quantify spatial characteristics of amyloid PET radiotracer uptake without the need for intensity normalization. The objective of this study is to calculate several HFs in different diagnostic groups and determine the group differences.


Methods
All image and metadata were acquired through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Subjects were grouped in three ways: by clinical diagnosis, by APOE e4 allele, and by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) score. Several GLCM matrices were calculated for different direction and distances (1-4 mm) from multiple regions on PET images. The HFs, contrast, correlation, dissimilarity, energy, entropy, and homogeneity, were calculated from these GLCMs. Wilcoxon tests and Student t-tests were performed on Haralick features and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values, respectively, to determine group differences. In addition to statistical testing, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the discrimination performance of the selected regional HFs and the SUVR values.


Results
Preliminary results from statistical testing indicate that HFs were capable of distinguishing groups at baseline and follow-up (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) in particular regions at much higher occurrences than SUVR (81 of 252). Conversely, we observed nearly no significant differences between all groups within ROIs at baseline or follow-up utilizing SUVR. From the ROC analysis, we found that the Energy and Entropy offered the best performance to distinguish Normal versus mild cognitive impairment and ADAS-Cog negative versus ADAS-Cog positive groups.


Conclusion
These results suggest that this technique could improve subject stratification in AD drug trials and help to evaluate the disease progression and treatment effects longitudinally without the disadvantages associated with intensity normalization.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Desmond Campbell"", ids = ""40135167""); list(name = ""Hakmook Kang"", ids = ""2244144""); list(name = ""Sepideh Shokouhi"", ids = ""33888468"")",c760f6bdf2bfb88f8d8d7a252e0190344490e99a; 6c4617fdc8aa39f81013af472aafc0537ea4f292,c473411b642fd5e778e145b636717a7f6362b186; df07a86ad38a2bc93dffe91e4925a99b819d87bf; f8077d3ab9568e3acae7aeaf8bdfc858c3531a8f; 39c933b8611f945ea7c9c71830e9261ac8cdf12b; bd284cac67d84d1f528ed81ee34f6394824f56aa; e702023c0085ac032779479a60bcc16a7b0e657a; dbbe693d9b07fb23410d40d1be2ab86901f84d9f; 53a1241df41b299cccab8b0dd8160231be110835; 1fdb62555eb650662dbe2a6f3985d390861597c2; 4eb63a04acc262b91a8ae538a0010b229022510a; c03d8b7f779277f6f8d3e5a63936d94eec8b31f4; e2e7f37cbc77f1d56ff531d733b70bd4b833ca36; 951ea832c0595afa2a973917a238d28de83194fc; 4771df1ee9656f9ad79564764eccf8f4ece689ed; 795ab250ae7ec7db22116d98d5b7ad714d47772c; f2b551b4a219d56005cfdb29052493deeba56b23; 0edb82e23624d20e6e8f64afa4fea230552c2991; 8b9f3ae88ec22a8cf58c11c5ce70630b804bfafb; 66203df83ad1e4c3df3c045d99aa91cfec563d07,Clinical Interventions in Aging,12,2077 - 2086

04d248bbaa01d2d3d0c0c52171a1d104eefa1ebc,Neural and dopaminergic correlates of fatigue in Parkinsonâ€™s disease,"Fatigue is one of the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Despite its clinical importance, there are few studies on the cause or mechanism of fatigue. Our aim was to find brain areas related to fatigue and to explore the association between striatal dopaminergic dysfunction and fatigue. We consecutively screened forty-seven patients with de novo PD from 2012 to 2017 and enrolled 32 patients. The gray matter volumes, white matter tracts, and striatal dopaminergic activity between PD without fatigue and with fatigue were compared. The correlation between fatigue and striatal dopaminergic activity was also analyzed. Our data did not show any significant difference in gray matter volume between PD without fatigue and with fatigue (familywise error [FWE] corrected pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) but revealed significantly higher mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values for all analyzed white matter tracts in PD with fatigue (false discovery rate [FDR] corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), except left cingulum-hippocampus (CH), right superior longitudinal fasciculus, and right longitudinal fasciculus temporal part (FDR corrected pâ€‰>â€‰0.06); lower mean diffusivity (MD) values for all analyzed white matter tracts in PD with fatigue (FDR corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), except in the left CH and uncinate fasciculus (FDR corrected pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). The mean radial diffusivity (RD) values, except for the left CH (FDR corrected pâ€‰=â€‰0.0576), were also significantly lower (FDR corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). There was no difference in dopaminergic deficits between PD without fatigue and PD with fatigue (pâ€‰>â€‰0.50). The alteration of the white matter tract may reflect the degree of fatigue in PD. This is not true of the gray matter and striatal dopaminergic activity.

83552c2feb755b95e0e8e63cdcbea86f36681bef,Individual Gene Expression Profiling of Bone Marrow CD34 Cells in Acquired Severe Aplastic Anemia (aSAA) in Children.,"Acquired SAA in children is a rare, life-threatening disease characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity. There is good clinical and laboratory evidence that a T-cell mediated immune attack against stem and progenitor cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SAA. However, due to the paucity of residual CD34 positive cells at diagnosis still only little is known about the stem cells and their response to the autoimmune attack in SAA in children. To further investigate the characteristics of CD34 cells in SAA we compared the individual transcriptomes of CD34 cells of 9 newly diagnosed, untreated pediatric SAA patients with 8 pediatric healthy controls. Hematopoietic stem cells were isolated with high efficiency from bone marrow by Ficoll density centrifugation and subsequent affinity purification using Dynabeads (Dynal, Invitrogen). Expression profiling experiments were performed using the two cycle amplification system and the HG-U133 plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix). Gene expression data were analyzed using R 2.3.0 and Bioconductor 1.8. packages (Affymetrix, multtest). Raw data were normalized using robust multiarray average (RMA) algorithm. Probe sets with â€œabsentâ€ calls in more than 50% of samples in the smaller group were identified and omitted from further analysis. To determine differentially expressed genes, t-test was applied. P value adjustments for multiple comparisons were done using the step-up false discovery rate (FDR) controlling method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. Overall 402 genes were differentially expressed in children with SAA compared to controls (p Despite the extremely low numbers of residual CD34 cells present in the bone marrow of children with untreated SAA we were able to analyze the individual transcriptome pattern of single patients. These patterns showed homogeneously and significantly different gene expressions in the group of affected children when compared to controls. Genes involved in apoptosis seem to be less altered in there expression than expected from adult data. These observation might be consistent with the major clinical finding in these children of almost empty bone marrows where most of the apoptotic cell death has already taken place. In the tiny population of â€œsurvivorsâ€ most of the differentially expressed genes are involved in cell metabolism and cell communication or adhesion. These unexpected results provide new hints for further investigations regarding the involvement of CD34 cells in the pathogenesis of childhood aSAA.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Bernd Hubner"", ids = ""47240535""); list(name = ""Sylvia Merk"", ids = ""21717287""); list(name = ""Sonja Rauhut"", ids = ""5861256""); list(name = ""Martin Dugas"", ids = ""152198280""); list(name = ""Torsten Haferlach"", ids = ""2905029""); list(name = ""Monika Fuehrer"", ids = ""80632324""); list(name = ""Arndt Borkhardt"", ids = ""2091682"")",,,Blood,108,978-978

Epigenetics is crucial to lasting changes in gene expression in the brain. Recent studies suggest a role for DNA methylation in ADHD. We explored the contribution to ADHD of allele-specific methylation (ASM), an epigenetic mechanism that involves SNPs correlating with differential levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites. We selected 3896 tagSNPs reported to influence methylation in human brain regions and performed a case-control association study using the summary statistics from the largest GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD, comprising 20,183 cases and 35,191 controls. We observed that genetic risk variants for ADHD are enriched in ASM SNPs and identified associations with eight tagSNPs that were significant at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). These SNPs correlated with methylation of CpG sites lying in the promoter regions of six genes. Since methylation may affect gene expression, we inspected these ASM SNPs together with 52 ASM SNPs in high LD with them for eQTLs in brain tissues and observed that the expression of three of those genes was affected by them. ADHD risk alleles correlated with increased expression (and decreased methylation) of ARTN and PIDD1 and with a decreased expression (and increased methylation) of C2orf82. Furthermore, these three genes were predicted to have altered expression in ADHD, and genetic variants in C2orf82 correlated with brain volumes. In summary, we followed a systematic approach to identify risk variants for ADHD that correlated with differential cis-methylation, identifying three novel genes contributing to the disorder.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Laura Pineda-Cirera"", ids = ""1404646563""); list(name = ""Anu Shivalikanjli"", ids = ""88728443""); list(name = ""Judit Cabana-DomÃ­nguez"", ids = ""1401669501""); list(name = ""Ditte Demontis"", ids = ""5147569""); list(name = ""Veera Manikandan Rajagopal"", ids = ""27610104""); list(name = ""Anders D.

b8a7087aea101c45c1378dcc6a0ebead691e3f7f,Effects of alpha particle radiation on gene expression in human pulmonary epithelial cells.,"The general public receives approximately half of its exposure to natural radiation through alpha (Î±)-particles from radon ((222)Rn) gas and its decay progeny. Epidemiological studies have found a positive correlation between exposure to (222)Rn and lung carcinogenesis. An understanding of the transcriptional responses involved in these effects remains limited. In this study, genomic technology was employed to mine for subtle changes in gene expression that may be representative of an altered physiological state. Human lung epithelial cells were exposed to 0, 0.03, 0.3 and 0.9Gy of Î±-particle radiation. Microarray analysis was employed to determine transcript expression levels 4h and 24h after exposure. A total of 590 genes were shown to be differentially expressed in the Î±-particle radiated samples (false discovery rate (FDR)â‰¤0.05). Sub-set of these transcripts were time-responsive, dose-responsive and both time- and dose-responsive. Pathway analysis showed functions related to cell cycle arrest, and DNA replication, recombination and repair (FDRâ‰¤0.05). The canonical pathways associated with these genes were in relation to pyrimidine metabolism, G2/M damage checkpoint regulation and p53 signaling (FDRâ‰¤0.05).

6ebe19d453e2ddb6d303761c9b046f4242cb543a,Coffee Consumption and Whole-Blood Gene Expression in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Post-Genome Cohort,"Norwegians are the second highest consumers of coffee in the world. Lately, several studies have suggested that beneficial health effects are associated with coffee consumption. By analyzing whole-blood derived, microarray based mRNA gene expression data from 958 cancer-free women from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Post-Genome Cohort, we assessed the potential associations between coffee consumption and gene expression profiles and elucidated functional interpretation. Of the 958 women included, 132 were considered low coffee consumers (<1 cup of coffee/day), 422 moderate coffee consumers (1â»3 cups of coffee/day), and 404 were high coffee consumers (>3 cups of coffee/day). At a false discovery rate <0.05, 139 genes were differentially expressed between high and low consumers of coffee. A subgroup of 298 nonsmoking, low tea consumers was established to isolate the effects of coffee from smoking and potential caffeine containing tea consumption. In this subgroup, 297 genes were found to be differentially expressed between high and low coffee consumers. Results indicate differentially expressed genes between high and low consumers of coffee with functional interpretations pointing towards a possible influence on metabolic pathways and inflammation.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Runa B Barnung"", ids = ""116247466""); list(name = ""Therese H NÃ¸st"", ids = ""1423055874""); list(name = ""Stine Marie Ulven"", ids = ""6250755""); list(name = ""Guri Skeie"", ids = ""2399348""); list(name = ""Karina S Olsen"", ids = ""118291851"")",d5ca42c9be77a170fcb8106bf016f9cf761e47f3; 35d95e023e591de39f74c5ef80843a4af8f0e65b,cd350e001b87770acfddf98532787b9f5983aba9; 0a89a02a7f5c6abb7352f3c2fb876034b6cd6961; 19de06fa0419389136b3395bf9f6bf9dffce3389; b8ead1b980a359cc5b269d7c7ba1a2ad96f9a2c9; 0c5fe2481ca8830b6fc47a64460d667b683e4dad; 96e349b0183946bfdde482e4638b59b6bd482d65; fc5de9e86996d53cfed3d502b2ab57d7af6c1140; 7b981ff232eebaaaaff7d8bf1fc8fba44582908a; 26cadfd70df7478ecd5a0c4abec09adbc8ef8905; 9ecf5522a5cdac7f89725219a97e4e4f8bdc85f0; 81bffb566491423b0f34f3ef1a2e1ca73c888b74; 6862ced45d23ab456fa10d21b0d2e87549326dcd; 01ed4aebe597916f7bfa9e53011d907b62d00832; fe8d284e8f895daaf5c9254df538cab0bb252f08; 4f00971c3cd89c25d0a7cc3d40707e683e79fbff; 8a72dedb8b58b31c9adbca7a49dd5ebab994577e; 1a6cbda3d26b5b5f5072c3eb0ff60c769be68c2b; a8d3bf2928a0f10de7e00e7e1f44b4e6ee7129ff; e14f59578f98d1a6be1f507645c854e7d5918c26; 37fd431959240d04c2f36feba109db589651fcf9; 9c1334037eafa8f3d4e3cdcbd287823d07548b96; 25815caffef91259eebc62b0099b3f3740ee14e9; b183af9aad70c1d50c54589a20dc4eb21f6ae8e8; 7a44ab3d90c35b4f323edf251e53c32fa66e7612; e0daf5cfb6cb35b1602a6a34b798ac179b40cb33; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; 1d2cd9538f6ef07a87534eb3324a09e6bcf9597a; e54beb27c3f9590f32f1a34c5d39d88572803f54; 92c4416a70ed1e4161b768f26eb5cd0cf99ac9f5; d400b1d78abc9437dfd419e8b8d89e217cb64320; 23e1f21df6f8659b868a60d564fb50092bd96cf9; 6dfd1643a04ab678a8f24d3caadc9f13e5c427ac; d2feefa39702978cc2ce4de133f1559482e37608; ce90600f33a9bca7144c77dd4e19a7b2b62cdb9d; 0dbed13aa9bf83447673801fed11b2cba7afc2a7; 880fff5b7314084ae898ba4db8200cc4964366ed; d388a386f2778f0a3fa0ed70d6b1b6f4367113a7; c4c15fbe9d0b31f548f4483b3e88bd3c4d422cbd; 0751b4ae01b9d6c81480d25394d71f93beb3d562; fa4cb78030c7255db7d12d528d91b7c48493d5eb; deb3ebc24d7f49f6e0005700f5962bb188431a68; 49eeaddba932205c0845138eb1ef5dd3da70b85e; 32c3eb26c6367c9e1bcfda7906c9572852f2b399; c4557f3eb0c2fbf1acd49ffc9c00768fa1f84ff4; 347417372bfacf3e2ae4b569229935c289bff49d; 318bf4c7cfd8659755ac8cade3bea229d788dd22; 859d41fedd82f04e0a58e7678a5b02943c8c3e26; f16ce25f079d6cf5c34d3bc0d813b1cf988a064c; 3b2b1dc83829d4a37342e542d840ec52396686da,Nutrients,10,
19fcc08c2aad26d51687b756df91cdf8e1ad3dfe,Deep Generative Models for Detecting Differential Expression in Single Cells,"Detecting differentially expressed genes is important for characterizing subpopulations of cells. However, in scRNA-seq data, nuisance variation due to technical factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying biological signal. First, we show that deep generative models, which combined Bayesian statistics and deep neural networks, better estimate the log-fold-change in gene expression levels between subpopulations of cells. Second, we use Bayesian decision theory to detect differentially expressed genes while controlling the false discovery rate. Our experiments on simulated and real datasets show that our approach out-performs state-of-the-art DE frameworks. Finally, we introduce a technique for improving the posterior approximation, and show that it also improves differential expression performance.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Pierre Boyeau"", ids = ""1441878314""); list(name = ""Romain Lopez"", ids = ""39848341""); list(name = ""Jeffrey Regier"", ids = ""52089318""); list(name = ""Adam Gayoso"", ids = ""48915254""); list(name = ""Michael I.

Consortium, Valenzano, Italy; 2University of Bari, Bari, Italy; 3Cattolica University, Rome, Italy; 4University of Padova, Padova, Italy; 5University of Piemonte Orientale, Novara, Italy; 6University of Turine, Turine, Italy. Background: Chronic rejection shows varying combination of lesions such as transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fi brosis/tubular atrophy and chronic transplant arteriopathy (CTA) which is characterized by larger arteries with intimal fi brosis, thickening of intima, invasion of proliferated smooth muscle cells and infi ltrates of mononuclear cells. Several independent coexisting factors contribute to the characteristic morphological features of CTA which are the fi nal event of different non-immunological and immunological pathways. Since smooth muscle cells respond to growth factors and vasoactive peptides we applied transcriptomics on archival formalin-fi xed, paraffi n-embedded (FFPE) renal tissue of patient with CTA for searching genes responsible for the production of humoral factors. Materials and Methods: Total RNA from 21 CTA biopsies was processed using cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, extension, and Ligation (DASL) Assay (Illumina). Fifty-two renal tissue samples obtained from cadaveric donors were used as controls. Results: Using fold change â‰¥2 and a false discovery rate<0.05, we identify 191 differentially modulated genes in CTA respect to cadaveric donors. Principal Component Analysis 3-D analysis showed that the two groups had signifi cant differences in gene expression distribution indicating two transcriptionally distant populations. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis approach showed functional gene set differentially expressed such as allograft rejection, and graft versus host disease. In particular, we focus on 9 modulated genes belonging to the leukocyte endothelial transmigration pathway, 16 up-regulated genes belonging to cell adhesion molecules pathway and 16 modulated genes belonging to natural killer mediated cytotoxicity, that were modulated more than 1.5 fold. Discussion and Conclusions: This study shows, for the fi rst time, that a characteristic gene expression profi le occurs in CTA. The in vivo and in vitro validation studies of some identifi ed genes may help in evolving strategies for diagnosis and treatment targeted to specifi c mechanisms.

V. Mas,1 J. Lee,1 L. Suh,1 R. Gehrau,1 L. Gallon,2 T. Lee,1 B. Kenneth,1 D. Maluf.1 1UVA, Charlottesville; 2NWU, Chicago. Background. Short-term kidney graft survival after kidney transplantation (KT) has continuously improved in recent years.However, allograft attrition over time remains undiminished mainly due to chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). Biomarkers for continuing monitoring of graft function and prediction of CAD progression are needed in KT. Material and Methods. A total of 158 deceased donor kidney transplant patients were included (age range: 21-83 years). Three available time point biopsies at pre-implantation, (K1); 3-(K3) and 12-months (K12) post-KT were used for gene expression analysis using microarrays (474 kidney samples) and for the time-course analyses. Probeset summaries were obtained using Robust Multiarray Analyses (RMA) algorithm. Logistic regression models, a method to determine the L1 constraint in order to force the model to the number of estimates within m/10 where m=min(n1,n0) non-zero parameters, were used. Results. Aiming to investigate the time-course genomic of gene expression data from a pre-KT time to continuous post-KT times up to 2-yr, we identifi ed 26 genes that were signifi cantly associated with KT long-term outcomes. CAD at 2-yr post-KT was used as study end-point (defi ned using graft function and histological fi ndings). We confi rmed that many of these 26 genes were related to kidney failure (e.g., lipocalin 2 (LCN2))and renal damage (e.g., interleukin 18 (IL18)) (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). Using a statistical dimension reduction technique, we developed multivariate statistical models on these genes from 3-mo post-KT organ biopsy samples (K3), and then independently tested their prediction performance on samples from different time points: pre-KT (K1) and 12-month post-KT (K12). In these independent predictions, our multi-gene models showed a highly signifi cant and consistent prediction performance for the patient sets at all three time points. In particular, the prediction was highly signifi cant based on the K1 samples for 15 to 22 gene models (Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value<0.01), suggesting that we could predict KT long-term outcomes based on pre-KT biopsy samples from donor organs. Conclusions. Dynamic analysis using gene expression at multiple time points postKT resulted in a reduced set of markers for monitoring graft function.

Background: Acute transplant glomerulitis (ATG) may be present in all types of acute rejection (AR). It Ìs associated with proteinuria and C4d deposits in peritubular capillaries (PTC C4d+) as a footprint of antibody mediated rejection. ATG can progress to chronic transplant glomerulopathy (CTG).The signifi cance of glomerular C4d deposits (G C4d+) is still unclear. Recent data suggests correlation with ATG. Aim: to characterize the clinicopathological features of ATG in biopsies with AR and evaluate progression to (CTG) in kidney transplant (KT) patients (pts). Methods: 102 indicated biopsies with AR (2006-2013) were retrospectively analyzed. Our study population was classifi ed according to the presence or absence of ATG (G1 n=42 and G2 n=60). C4d stain by immunofl uorescence was performed in all biopsies. Immunohistochemistry for CD68, CD3, CD8, CD4 and CD 20 was done in 31/42 biopsies (G1). Screening for the presence of circulating Donor-Specifi c anti HLA antibodies (DSA) was performed using Luminex. The Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for comparing continuous variables. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi2 test. p < 0.05 was considered signifi cant. Data are expressed as median, range. Results: ATG was found in 41.2% of biopsies. There were no signifi cant differences in serum creatinine between both groups at 6, 12 and 24 months. Proteinuria was the indication for biopsy in 35% vs 6 % and it was signifi cantly higher in G1 at 6,12 and 24 months (p<0.0001, p<0.0004 and p<0.05).CD68 was the infl ammatory cell phenotype in G1 (23/42, 55%) and was absent in G2 (p<0.0001). PTC C4d+ staining was 20/42 (48%) in G1 vs 8/49 (14%) in G2 (p=0.0006). G C4d+ concomitant deposits were found in 69% in G1. De novo DSA was positive in 10/42 (23.8%pts) in G1 vs 2/60 (3.3%pts) in G2. Incidence of late AR was more frequent in patients with ATG: 74% vs 38% (p=0.0009) Post-rejection control biopsies showed more progression to CTG in patients with ATG (59% vs 26%, p=0.002). Conclusion: ATG was associated with proteinuria, late AR, PTC C4d+ and G C4d+ codeposits as markers of humoral rejection. In this study, CTG was more frequent in patients with previous ATG.

89199d1ec7c32dafbf707f34f551a3200b7fcae5,Lifetime major depression and grey-matter volume,"Background
There is evidence of structural brain alterations in major depressive disorder (MDD), but little is known about how these alterations might be affected by age at onset or genetic vulnerability. This study examines whether lifetime episodes of MDD are associated with specific alterations in grey-matter volume, and whether those alterations vary according to sex or serotonin transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) genotype (LL, SL or SS).


Methods
We used structural MRI to acquire anatomic scans from 610 community-dwelling participants. We derived quantitative regional estimates of grey-matter volume in 16 subregions using FreeSurfer software. We diagnosed MDD according to DSM-IV criteria. We adjusted analyses for age, sex, total brain volume, education level, head injury and comorbidities.


Results
Lifetime MDD was associated with a smaller insula, thalamus, ventral diencephalon, pallidum and nucleus accumbens and with a larger pericalcarine region in both men and women. These associations remained after adjustment for false discovery rate. Lifetime MDD was also associated with a smaller caudate nucleus and amygdala in men and with a larger rostral anterior cingulate cortex in women. Late-onset first episodes of MDD (after age 50 years) were associated with a larger rostral anterior cingulate cortex and lingual and pericalcarine regions; early-onset MDD was associated with a smaller ventral diencephalon and nucleus accumbens. Some associations differed according to 5-HTTLPR genotype: the thalamus was smaller in participants with MDD and the LL genotype; pericalcarine and lingual volumes were higher in those with the SL genotype.


Limitations
This study was limited by its cross-sectional design.


Conclusion
Major depressive disorder was associated with persistent volume reductions in the deep nuclei and insula and with enlargements in visual cortex subregions; alterations varied according to age of onset and genotype.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marie-Laure Ancelin"", ids = ""78524943""); list(name = ""Isabelle CarriÃ¨re"", ids = ""3977583""); list(name = ""Sylvaine ArtÃ©ro"", ids = ""4688244""); list(name = ""Jerome J.

To gain further insight into the role of Mj-FAR-1 in regulating disease development, local transcriptional changes were monitored in tomato hairy root lines with constitutive mj-far-1 expression compared with control roots without inoculation, and 2, 5 and 15Â days after inoculation (DAI), using mRNA sequencing analysis.ResultsGene-expression profiling revealed a total of 3970 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two lines. Among the DEGs, 1093, 1039, 1959, and 1328 genes were up- or downregulated 2-fold with false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.001 in noninoculated roots, and roots 2, 5, and 15 DAI compared with control roots, respectively. Four main groups of genes that might be associated with Mj-FAR-1-mediated susceptibility were identified: 1) genes involved in biotic stress responses such as pathogen-defense mechanisms and hormone metabolism; 2) genes involved in phenylalanine and phenylpropanoid metabolism; 3) genes associated with cell wall synthesis, modification or degradation; and 4) genes associated with lipid metabolism. All of these genes were overrepresented among the DEGs. Studying the distances between the treatments, samples from noninoculated roots and roots at 2 DAI clustered predominantly according to the temporal dynamics related to nematode infection. However, at the later time points (5 and 15 DAI), samples clustered predominantly according to mj-far-1 overexpression, indicating that at these time points Mj-FAR-1 is more important in defining a common transcriptome.ConclusionsThe presence of four groups of DEGs demonstrates a network of molecular events is mediated by Mj-FAR-1 that leads to highly complex manipulation of plant defense responses against nematode invasion. The results shed light on the in vivo role of secreted FAR proteins in parasitism, and add to the mounting evidence that secreted FAR proteins play a major role in nematode parasitism.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ionit Iberkleid"", ids = ""3933398""); list(name = ""Noa Sela"", ids = ""2816598""); list(name = ""Sigal Brown Miyara"", ids = ""4452171"")",6f505a3ab9a51fb5860c91fa934de8d6309950a3; 5ae3711fb93fa6bc5c7446a41dacf6c399db70fd; a8beb5c466e52faf7bd9f8b91a6c9f46d893ba06; 8117ca5df6105d40ef0527f6cc50d7527b482083; 7b1076d30b208e311a85440e7f35bdfc5004686d; 3d9f5763ac370b863e308bdafcb2a145835c04f7; a857e4542ec9395092cf4c7605708ca08e544a52; eea018f3352370e772970ce5a2c90e9f6c1ca2e8; faec50a80ac658b36a3085a6ccbd61f77ac4092f; 282b4097eaf15b3b4a72b5b99f1434aaa7e513eb; 7d0dababbe550ed415b81e404eca70b411f551ce; 465b0e50ed7193c3ec71f29f1dafa18d750d8734; bb968da33fa0c88b530a6085a6c66a0d44212793; 0dcf844a0388c0e7eb84128db6e1fcb6cff95828; 9bbd29440100db7502d572bf4e068ef017af883d; f9fd3f31ea322e872635632734d03d5394739902; f2ba4cd09d9b3b17ec5df7e42dbe2bf3e5f372d3; 956069dbd02e29738264371fdca19427d40f618b; fb28b84ef7e985b77707cf2cfdb089b34b3c1ee4,36d3684156653f4456e9adb02fa03e1a66ae4678; aac9aca2c37186c87275ee2631a0535a0257d1dc; 4d115fa6bb5bb11f1e2d7b2fc47386b3672d4d72; 51a4b837bdd32bc37fd5a3a8a95959f4770c44b0; 757ffe63aee007a01704253252933d4952aaf49d; 4aa12861a80e5b1176af4eb96c954848ea5c8933; 3d0a000ef1ad31b63462d0bef1c9255b15186ee2; 078c95bfa84d1bd4c2a0b0a0992c7f0ba1881201; 3945a76c655b01cb471624ce090876bc352c5944; 438edfcc06b7547eb1f52ce4a06a1c5ea9b9a6df; d5d9aaa7fb7d67ed26fad38579d748e5795dbeaf; 8310d8a2272b6b5a38ae3a2d5d5c62c0f6fa26ff; e4c2d1f7614004702f3c8fe7e6b9f76c10571186; b3903185c80288dc4942ae283344247e022ae894; 1a4b568ec8afff398acd0c37fc2d6d698fb2895e; 36dc16ae075e522855c5fe5c19db532572cae6ea; e40d4ee143a2d4464b33554c3092078c0ef8bf38; 1c00135d5fb7fc6aba650f9e0fb67ad8365830d7; 55c54b2450d95a7fd943f421ea6cb8f6cd80e3e4; e917c668d530f1dbb9d71fc7464c1b03115634b9; a587ee5d176cf1c55ee893d3ba52ede38f79e191; 8430ed769b86d38a4a27be15b9ef390f70df3549; bd8708544ebd5655768b638397916ae3c019e1b6; bcfd2a9ecf7c529825f4b9c330b0adcff2c51bfd; 030d496f2b9a42fb3c7fdba3ca1c7ce41f3f8f33; f854bd1d0560c852310f6bae108233d8a0bf334f; d3f1b0bda539faabea2c6bae5614c12211455e4c; e0c520e024379cbb4a8410678c7693f168a93df0; b1f59b989ce5a6acda99d63e25f5b3917e4cb384; fece1ff14a71ea37e7e31bc81ab1b33146a47cab; 4576963fe9b45d404633d4fe45fb7dfde8ffc6ac; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 25b24c7ecbce3a078da53537e94c9e0ebee2bd91; 915d70dd12ff9c9ce8d0e0d0c67f5b153775c223; 9feff29f5782ec8c5484570e9794feb2b7a5cd28; 2175433d04e14fc304fd09e413a30fd48b8aacd6; 32e48251d870f4c8cb9ae33fee9c8804f2a27b7f; 6412551234965bd75277f11cf68baf1ab16f4b2f; bba94e7e6ba97ad8b0e49203c31b3532aa1f1816; 54dba7dfda194691f914185c0ddcb535574b8516; 0ef49c9de6dddfef5a7af069fba15792c14a3334; dd4e8d28714c5424de656547ba3d415b3f8b4e02; 4542d2661a428097fd38378dcd0ac317692cb357; 3ffa5cdadb0cce46dcda04b888e3d9bcab8524c2; 8bce8a10171e143838cd1c800670dc8542e4a7d0; ee03257cde78f44c2dd9cf2dd15a5f6979ce200c; c55ee1e35b80f47dd9f784a3e7171c2830a8aca6; a9bca38efce705418bcf23247f2a1a2942662db9; eb5082ae26891118c3b1679581642cf9e45ff2a9; 2a27c8e9550a93a4923fdeb026add08591678898; bebbf402ba496419c5fb5a80c70a82e2a6e8a69f; 9028ca433e54acd3c8db24e6f35135121b1840cd; 2ac35d93395703efe5be87791c6da15834177fe8; f2a7b17b8c31b9932a6f797742f651ade16c3495; b5bc54bf32a9df074679d3f5ef96667529f31a6e; 9f9624f85d7e7d91b17ff462c6b80fbdc21d4402; 14a8381c43dec7fb6a92ac4686cb0a89ee100274; b9000f60bf76732cc8cce708929da95c6c6a609e; 79d4d60341f34be8c01195e01dbc09104d5a370b; e349bf69c24e8c9a644dde4b7c73b96e2bd1c03f; dfad5030c0f94a2db6760137ad22c6142d2098ca; 7c698e4e722bec07896498f1252a591cd38e2af8; ea42142b82c13cbb668e058d1d365f804155a4f4; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; ccd5f536174e2bf96bf4434e012051377cd88d0e; 43b523cb69e42547f30cd9c97e2fa14a9f6b64c7; a6375be2d2b90a1b474971d34060a8073a155033; 6606ae277bada630f14857392dbb2ec6be12dee6; d63ee87b6e6511d8326adcc353aadebbf5cd706c; 17ade4741e2469f31f35988efb9f6c632e4d93c2; ac80db7e5599f9fc2e56fbc68230d8b12b1bc3f9; 960a69a8429f58e07efd40b4d2fb254299616979; ba7f5c52ebbabd8bd8444ed0d29ddb086c7d532e; 222766f6d26601694b04eb6e8404e75e7c75db07; 93b4b34ed56f4bd44fe82b9d5eb9c04b4998fba4; 0819eb077d0ade1b12a2994e1277d1fbb9c42401; 85de3cc99ba1bc671db9bd6c08276912adb35eb1; 5dc7e0b13d024c70d6bcd60d1376e166426a7611; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; 815b60ac1cab0bd662bebae5acc5db4e2536d6bb; 0f7190f40e67f1821226df08d170e0accf054065; 9eee682a7c5074dda1148584ad74da7a5416db9c; c5a59c94ec08a1fa95b86874b0ae67a8be02226d,BMC Genomics,16,

6e3ecccc4a0c20f1625439f5e558145171f3ebbd,Preprocessing Steps for Agilent MicroRNA Arrays: Does the Order Matter?,"Motivation/Background Previous publications on microarray preprocessing mostly focused on method development or comparison for an individual preprocessing step. Very few, if any, focused on recommending an effective ordering of the preprocessing steps, in particular, normalization in relationship to log transformation and probe set summarization. In this study, we aim to study how the relative ordering of the preprocessing steps influences differential expression analysis for Agilent microRNA array data. Methods A set of 192 untreated primary gynecologic tumor samples (96 endometrial tumors and 96 ovarian tumors) were collected at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center during the period of 2000â€“2012. From this same sample set, two datasets were generated: one dataset had no confounding array effects by experimental design and served as the benchmark, and another dataset exhibited array effects and served as the test data. We preprocessed our test dataset using different orderings between the following three steps: quantile normalization, log transformation, and median summarization. Differential expression analysis was performed on each preprocessed test dataset, and the results were compared against the results from the benchmark dataset. True positive rate, false positive rate, and false discovery rate were used to assess the effectiveness of the orderings.

3e22312181b7a0fb13e194185319e7f016811746,Abstract 3372: Differential exon usage in the HER2 subtype of breast cancer identified with RNA-seq and proteomic data,"Background: Heterogeneity between different breast cancer tumors plays an important role in patientsâ€™ survival outcomes, and such tumor heterogeneity unveiled by transcriptome and proteome are often in disagreement. We hypothesize that alternative splicing of mRNA could explain heterogeneity within intrinsic breast cancer subtypes. Methods: Cases used in this study were drawn from the Clinical Breast Care Project where breast cancer patients were consented using an IRB-approved protocol. Fifty breast tumors were selected and processed by laser microdissection. RNA and protein were extracted from tissues using the Illustra triplePrep kit (GE Healthcare). Paired-end mRNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Paired-end reads were preprocessed using PRINSEQ and splice-aligned to the genome using GSNAP software. Gene counts were measured using HTSeq while Exon counts used the DEXSeq. Differential expression was called at 10% false discovery rate. Proteome Discoverer with Byonic node was used for analyzing the quantitative global proteomics dataset, and we were able to quantitate 8600 proteins. All other analyses were performed using Perl and R. Results: The number of sequencing reads for the 50 cases ranged from 60 million to 410 million reads. After preprocessing, an average of 93% of reads was mapped, and 36,700 genes were identified among 50 tumor samples. PAM50 algorithm was used for intrinsic subtype calls, yielding 16 Basal, 8 Her2+, 19 Luminal A (LA) and 7 Luminal B tumors. Unsupervised clustering of the 8 Her2+ cases using the PAM50 genes and highly varying proteins resulted in different clustering patterns, with the latter clustering 6 of the 8 Her2+ cases with two distinct 3-case sub-clusters. Between these two sub-clusters, there were 10 differentially expressed (DEX) genes and 25 DEX proteins, but none of the 25 proteins were mapped to the 10 DEX genes. This motivated us to investigate the DEX exons, and we found 7,076 DEX exons between the Her2+ sub-clusters, and 9 of the 25 DEX proteins were matched to genes bearing DEX exons. For comparison, we performed the same analyses between similarly clustered Basal and LA sub-clusters. Even though the number of DEX genes between Basal (8) and LA (18) sub-clusters were comparable to that between the Her2+ sub-clusters, DEX exons were much lower for both subtypes (616 & 157), and none of the DEX proteins (3 & 7) mapped to DEX exons or genes for either subtype. Conclusions: Our findings imply that there is more proteomic-level heterogeneity in the Her2+ subtype than in Basal and LA subtypes, which could be due to alternative usage of exons (alternative splicing). If such heterogeneity is associated with patientsâ€™ survival outcomes then our results will further stress the importance of alternative splicing in breast cancer.

5879cc6bb033316c0115583e290f3506860fe88f,Suggestive association between PLA2G12A single nucleotide polymorphism rs2285714 and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration,"PURPOSE
The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, with drugs such as ranibizumab and bevacizumab, to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) produces an effective but widely variable response. Identifying markers that predict differentiated response could serve as a valuable assay in developing more personalized medicine. This study aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence the outcome of treatment with anti-VEGF therapy for AMD.


METHODS
One hundred six patients with nAMD were treated with either ranibizumab or bevacizumab as needed over a period of 12 months. Visual acuity and the presence of macular fluid were measured with optical coherence tomography at baseline, six months, and 12 months. Patients were then classified as good or poor responders based on change in visual acuity and macular fluid on follow-up visits. DNA extracted from blood was genotyped with a TaqMan-based allelic discrimination SNP assay for 21 SNPs in six candidate genes (PLAG12A, IL23R, STAT3, VEGFA, KDR, and HIF1A). The SNPs were primarily selected based on previously reported associations with AMD and functional involvement in angiogenesis pathways. SNPs shown to be promising for association with anti-VEGF therapy were then assessed in an independent AMD case-control cohort.


RESULTS
Of the 106 patients with nAMD, 77 were classified as good responders and 29 as poor responders. For rs2285714 (PLA2G12A), the frequency of minor allele T was 40.1% for good responders compared to 51.7% for poor responders (odds ratio: 1.60, 95% confidence interval of odds ratio: 0.87-2.94, p=0.13). Genetic model analysis of rs2285714 (PLA2G12A) demonstrated an association between rs2285714 (PLA2G12A) and therapy response in a dominant genotypic model. Patients carrying at least one T allele of rs2285714 were 2.79 times (95% confidence interval=1.02-7.69, p<0.05) more likely to be poor responders (79.3% of poor responders) than good responders (57.3% of good responders). However, after adjusting for multiple testing by the false discovery rate or Bonferroni correction, the initially observed association was no longer statistically significant. No association was identified between the remaining SNPs and response status. The SNP rs2285714 of PLA2G12A was not significantly associated with AMD in an independent AMD case-control cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
Data suggest a possible weak association between rs2285714 (PLA2G12A) and response to anti-VEGF therapy, but the association must be confirmed in additional cohorts with larger patient samples. Identifying factors that predict the differentiated response could provide a valuable assay for developing approaches in personalized medicine.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vinson M.

Given a noisy signal, the RROMP algorithm first generates several sparse representations of it by applying a multi-selection strategy and a false discovery rate (FDR) control, instead of seeking the sparsest one. The multi-selection strategy accelerates the whole process of generating the representations, while the FDR control enables each representation to be competitive. Then the generated representations are averaged to form a more accurate estimate in the sense of mean-square-error (MSE).

The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and the roles of metabolomics have been rarely studied. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the reduction in dietary sodium intake would induce changes in metabolomic profiling among black hypertensives, and the changes would be associated with reduced blood pressure (BP) and improved skin capillary density. A total of 64 untreated black hypertensives were included from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of sodium reduction. The participants were given either 9 slow sodium tablets (10 mmol sodium per tablet) or placebo tablets daily for 6 weeks, they then crossed over to receive the other tablets for another 6 weeks, while on reduced sodium diet aiming at achieving daily sodium intake around 2.0 g. Untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed in paired serum samples, which were collected at the end of each period, so were BP and capillary density. Mixed-effects models were used. There were 34 metabolites identified with raw P's<0.05. Among those, 2 metabolites including Î²-hydroxyisovalerate and methionine sulfone were significantly increased with sodium reduction (false discovery rate =0.006 and 0.099, respectively). Increased Î²-hydroxyisovalerate was associated with reduced office systolic BP and ambulatory daytime systolic BP, whereas increased methionine sulfone was associated with reduced 24-hour diastolic BP, ambulatory nighttime diastolic BP, and increased skin capillary density. Our results suggest that dietary sodium reduction increases the circulating levels of Î²-hydroxyisovalerate and methionine sulfone. Further studies are warranted.

Multiple separation strategies were utilized, including the focused isolation of mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved proteome coverage relative to previous work. In all, 347 mitochondrial proteins were identified, including ~50% of the mitochondrial proteome below 30 kDa and over 75% of the subunits constituting the large complexes of oxidative phosphorylation. Three hundred of the identified proteins were found to be integral membrane proteins containing between 1 and 12 transmembrane helices, requiring no specific enrichment or modified LC-MS parameters. Over 5,000 proteoforms were observed, many harboring post-translational modifications, including over a dozen proteins containing lipid anchors (some previously unknown) and many others with phosphorylation and methylation modifications.

c2b7a3ff5cc0fd68e95bf787e41e6ef46505fab1,Accuracy of genome-wide imputation of untyped markers and impacts on statistical power for association studies,"BackgroundAlthough high-throughput genotyping arrays have made whole-genome association studies (WGAS) feasible, only a small proportion of SNPs in the human genome are actually surveyed in such studies. In addition, various SNP arrays assay different sets of SNPs, which leads to challenges in comparing results and merging data for meta-analyses. Genome-wide imputation of untyped markers allows us to address these issues in a direct fashion.Methods384 Caucasian American liver donors were genotyped using Illumina 650Y (Ilmn650Y) arrays, from which we also derived genotypes from the Ilmn317K array. On these data, we compared two imputation methods: MACH and BEAGLE. We imputed 2.5 million HapMap Release22 SNPs, and conducted GWAS on ~40,000 liver mRNA expression traits (eQTL analysis). In addition, 200 Caucasian American and 200 African American subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500 K array plus a custom 164 K fill-in chip. We then imputed the HapMap SNPs and quantified the accuracy by randomly masking observed SNPs.ResultsMACH and BEAGLE perform similarly with respect to imputation accuracy. The Ilmn650Y results in excellent imputation performance, and it outperforms Affx500K or Ilmn317K sets. For Caucasian Americans, 90% of the HapMap SNPs were imputed at 98% accuracy. As expected, imputation of poorly tagged SNPs (untyped SNPs in weak LD with typed markers) was not as successful. It was more challenging to impute genotypes in the African American population, given (1) shorter LD blocks and (2) admixture with Caucasian populations in this population. To address issue (2), we pooled HapMap CEU and YRI data as an imputation reference set, which greatly improved overall performance. The approximate 40,000 phenotypes scored in these populations provide a path to determine empirically how the power to detect associations is affected by the imputation procedures. That is, at a fixed false discovery rate, the number of cis-eQTL discoveries detected by various methods can be interpreted as their relative statistical power in the GWAS. In this study, we find that imputation offer modest additional power (by 4%) on top of either Ilmn317K or Ilmn650Y, much less than the power gain from Ilmn317K to Ilmn650Y (13%).ConclusionCurrent algorithms can accurately impute genotypes for untyped markers, which enables researchers to pool data between studies conducted using different SNP sets. While genotyping itself results in a small error rate (e.g. 0.5%), imputing genotypes is surprisingly accurate. We found that dense marker sets (e.g. Ilmn650Y) outperform sparser ones (e.g. Ilmn317K) in terms of imputation yield and accuracy. We also noticed it was harder to impute genotypes for African American samples, partially due to population admixture, although using a pooled reference boosts performance. Interestingly, GWAS carried out using imputed genotypes only slightly increased power on top of assayed SNPs. The reason is likely due to adding more markers via imputation only results in modest gain in genetic coverage, but worsens the multiple testing penalties. Furthermore, cis-eQTL mapping using dense SNP set derived from imputation achieves great resolution, and locate associate peak closer to causal variants than conventional approach.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ke Hao"", ids = ""143928258""); list(name = ""Eugene Chudin"", ids = ""49433529""); list(name = ""Joshua J McElwee"", ids = ""143964722""); list(name = ""Eric E.

ccfc74cbb66c03d0e23a88d1fcf5bda140bed94e,How to infer relative fitness from a sample of genomic sequences.,"Mounting evidence suggests that natural populations can harbor extensive fitness diversity with numerous genomic loci under selection. It is also known that genealogical trees for populations under selection are quantifiably different from those expected under neutral evolution and described statistically by Kingman's coalescent. While differences in the statistical structure of genealogies have long been used as a test for the presence of selection, the full extent of the information that they contain has not been exploited. Here we demonstrate that the shape of the reconstructed genealogical tree for a moderately large number of random genomic samples taken from a fitness diverse, but otherwise unstructured, asexual population can be used to predict the relative fitness of individuals within the sample. To achieve this we define a heuristic algorithm, which we test in silico, using simulations of a Wright-Fisher model for a realistic range of mutation rates and selection strength. Our inferred fitness ranking is based on a linear discriminator that identifies rapidly coalescing lineages in the reconstructed tree. Inferred fitness ranking correlates strongly with actual fitness, with a genome in the top 10% ranked being in the top 20% fittest with false discovery rate of 0.1-0.3, depending on the mutation/selection parameters. The ranking also enables us to predict the genotypes that future populations inherit from the present one. While the inference accuracy increases monotonically with sample size, samples of 200 nearly saturate the performance. We propose that our approach can be used for inferring relative fitness of genomes obtained in single-cell sequencing of tumors and in monitoring viral outbreaks.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adel Dayarian"", ids = ""2615727""); list(name = ""Boris I.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying genetic male sterility is yet poorly understood. The morphological differences of flower buds of melon were observed showed that the flower buds were tetrad when they were 1â€¯mm stage and monocyte microspore when they were 2â€¯mm stage. Electron microscopy showed that there was significant difference between MS lines and MF (male fertility) lines. In order to detect the global expression of the genes during the melon anther development and association with MS, 12 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) libraries were constructed from the anther of MS and MF in the bud stage with 1 and 2â€¯mm diameter, respectively. A total of 765 DEGs expressed in anther during different developmental stage (MS 1â€¯mm vs. MS 2â€¯mm), 148 and 309 DEGs were found to be related to MS as compared to MF (MS 1â€¯mm vs. MF 1â€¯mm, and MS 2â€¯mm vs. MF 2â€¯mm) at a false discovery rate FDR <0.01. Among these, 10 DEGs were expressed in all the three comparisons, including transcription factor bHLH genes. Among the DEGs in RNA-seq analysis, 28 were validated by qRT-PCR. Of these, a number of genes were involved in ABC transfactor B family, cytochrome-related genes, hormone-related genes (auxin transporter, gibberellin-regulated protein), MADS-box protein genes, F-box protein genes, peroxidase-related, and Zinc finger protein genes. These genes are involved in many biological pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism, signal transduction mechanisms and transcription factors, etc. Compared to the same developmental stage of MS and MF, the different developmental stages of MS indicated diverse gene regulation pathways involved in the anther development in MS. These results would provide novel insight into the global network to male sterility in melon.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dongyang Dai"", ids = ""5555725""); list(name = ""Anping Xiong"", ids = ""2535403""); list(name = ""Liwei Yuan"", ids = ""49785183""); list(name = ""Yunyan Sheng"", ids = ""17747643""); list(name = ""Peng Ji"", ids = ""47456641""); list(name = ""Yazhong Jin"", ids = ""3629566""); list(name = ""Dandan Li"", ids = ""143670014""); list(name = ""Yanhong Wang"", ids = ""49415670""); list(name = ""Feishi Luan"", ids = ""36258813"")",8e174109f402f50b41bd27dfdc62f7991da373f7,,Gene,707,"

afaa349b5407731083c0954009b465d41ea5a49a,"Abstract 3268: Associations of plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), choline, and betaine with the gut microbiome and biomarkers of inflammation and cardiometabolic risk in the Multiethnic Cohort","Background: TMAO is produced by gut microbial metabolism of dietary quaternary amines and has been linked to several chronic diseases, including colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, the microbes and mechanisms involved are still unclear. Here, we aimed to 1) identify microbial taxa associated with TMAO and 2) evaluate associations of plasma TMAO, along with its precursors choline and betaine, with inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in 1,716 participants (men and women, 60-77, and of 5 racial/ethnic groups) of the Adiposity Phenotype Study within the Multiethnic Cohort in Hawaii and California. Plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine were measured by LC-MS/MS. The gut microbiome was analyzed by Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 region using DNA extracted from stool. Fasting blood was analyzed for lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and insulin by ELISA; C-reactive protein (CRP), cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides using a Cobas autoanalyzer; and HOMA-IR for insulin resistance by derivation. Associations between microbial genera and TMAO were assessed with negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models, with control of the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Associations of TMAO, choline, and betaine with biomarkers were determined using multivariable linear regression and a ZINB model for CRP, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, physical activity, aspirin use, and % body fat. Results: Of 105 genera examined, 7 were associated with TMAO at an FDR of 0.01: Streptoccoccus, Blautia, Clostridium, a genus from the Ruminococcaceae family, Butyricimonas, Lactobacillus, and an uncultured Verrucomicrobia of the order vadinHA64; all showed a positive relationship. Plasma choline (Î²Â±SE: 0.23Â±0.10; p=0.03) and betaine (0.19Â±0.08; p=0.02), but not TMAO, were positively associated with CRP, whereas only choline was associated with LBP (1.97Â±0.80; p=0.01). Choline was inversely associated with HDL cholesterol (-14.86Â±2.29; p Conclusion: We found several genera of gut microbes associated with plasma TMAO, including Clostridium, several species of which can metabolize choline to trimethylamine. We also identified associations between plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine with inflammatory and cardiometabolic markers, particularly choline, which indicated risk to adverse health outcomes.

Recovery from stroke is varied and often results in deficits that can affect daily living. Because of this incomplete recovery, it is extremely important to have a comprehensive prognosis for patients so they understand the level of recovery to expect and which treatments may be applicable for their condition. This study attempts to overcome this limitation by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) to identify specific anatomical regions required for preservation of motor function. Methods: One-hundred-and-fifty moderate to moderately-severe chronic (minimum >6months; mean 63 months) stroke subjects (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer = 28-50, Arm Motor Ability Test > 35) were imaged with a 1mm isotropic T1-weighted volumetric sequence and their motor performance assessed. The data were collected over 26 sites across all MR vendors and at 1.5T and 3T field strengths. All data were transferred via Dicom data format. The T1 volume images were normalized to a symmetric template using SPM5. All right hemisphere lesions were maintained in the native space and also oriented so the lesion appeared in the left hemisphere to facilitate comparisons of handedness, and hemisphere location. Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) is able to statistically assess the lesionâ€™s effect on behavioral scores on a voxel-byvoxel basis (Bates 2003). In each lesioned voxel a statistical test is conducted to determine if a difference in the behavioral measures exists between the lesioned and non-lesioned group. The groups are assigned at each new voxel location based on the presence of the lesion. A t-test produces a statistical map overlaid on the lesioned voxels. This voxel-by-voxel analysis produces high resolution statistical maps (1 mm), rather than a large region of interest analysis or lesion categories as seen in prior lesion studies. VLSM analysis is not limited by tissue type as in voxel based morphometry or BOLD functional MRI which only assesses blood flow changes in gray matter. VLSM interrogates any type of brain tissue included in the lesion maps.The lesioned areas were manually segmented on the normalized T1 image. All 3D lesion maps were entered into VLSM analysis. Areas showing significant correlations with functional performance measures were identified using the false discovery rate corrected at p â‰¤ 0.05. Results: VLSM analysis was performed on the entire data set (e.g. lesions flipped so that they would all be oriented in the left hemisphere) and then pursued on stratified data in the native space (right-hemisphere and left-hemisphere; dominant-hemisphere lesion and non-dominant hemisphere lesion). A right-hemisphere lesion is defined as a lesion appearing in the right-hemisphere of the brain. A dominant-hemisphere lesion is defined as a lesion that appears in the hemisphere contralateral to the dominant hand (e.g. right-handed individual with a lesion in the left hemisphere). Lesions which appeared in both hemispheres were eliminated in these strata.

A well-known inference method is to control the false discovery rate. One popular approach is to model the z-scores derived from the individual t-tests and then use this model to control the false discovery rate. We propose a heteroscedastic contaminated normal mixture to describe the distribution of z-scores and design an EM-test for testing homogeneity in this class of mixture models. The proposed EM-test can be used to investigate whether a collection of z-scores has arisen from a single normal distribution or whether a heteroscedastic contaminated normal mixture is more appropriate. We show that the EM-test statistic has a shifted mixture of chi-squared limiting distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed testing procedure has accurate type-I error and significantly larger power than its competitors under a variety of model specifications. A real-data example is analysed to exemplify the application of the proposed method.,2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xiaoqing Niu"", ids = ""3317297""); list(name = ""Pengfei Li"", ids = ""50492571""); list(name = ""Yuejiao Fu"", ids = ""48467775"")",,ef591fd0b95f553c8e54c27a3f7e272937271f67; 863a8fcc84a987d8a47f2991c4090989dae73e01; 1da44460d7acc50002b251d7add6705cf5a78d59; b548abbe75f8583bf204b991262f8816d52019ac; 1fda32569253ddc5fdaee5aaea701e0334e68d9f; c6903d2703142a82228fcc8baad0e02c5e7da646; de207e5d3bf577ce921e76e877d9600723583c91; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 284a0abb2292c067ab265c6e60ef4fa0d956a32d; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; d999a0ed2ca86de42e67e86b34881c8e6a001d35; fd3d628f90e73744621c26421869d90e7eddeb3f; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54,Journal of Applied Statistics,46,1478 - 1491

Food and nutrient intakes were calculated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards modeling and covariate-balanced propensity scores were used to assess the associations between all nutrients and PCa.ResultsA total of 229 men were diagnosed with PCa by prostate biopsy. Among all nutrients, increased risk of PCa was associated with intake of dietary fat scaled by the total caloric intake, particularly saturated fatty acid (SFA) [HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07â€“1.32), P valueâ€‰<â€‰0.001, False discovery rate (FDR) 0.047] and trans fatty acid (TFA) [HR per quintile 1.21; (95% CI) (1.08â€“1.35), Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, FDR 0.039]. There was an increased risk of PCa with increasing intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (HR per quintile 1.14; 95% CI 1.03â€“1.27, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, FDR 0.15) and cholesterol [HR per quintile 1.13; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (1.02â€“1.26), P-value 0.02, FDR 0.19].ConclusionAfter examining a large, population-based cohort for PCa diagnosis, we identified dietary total fat and certain fatty acids as associated with increased risk of PCa. We found no factors that were protective from PCa.

aa8c30ad333a5d5ec3308f2e8201a944ca53da49,Distinct DNA methylation profiles in bone and blood of osteoporotic and healthy postmenopausal women.,"DNA methylation affects expression of associated genes and may contribute to the missing genetic effects from genome-wide association studies of osteoporosis. To improve insight into the mechanisms of postmenopausal osteoporosis, we combined transcript profiling with DNA methylation analyses in bone. RNA and DNA were isolated from 84 bone biopsies of postmenopausal donors varying markedly in bone mineral density (BMD). In all, 2529 CpGs in the top 100 genes most significantly associated with BMD were analyzed. The methylation levels at 63 CpGs differed significantly between healthy and osteoporotic women at 10% false discovery rate (FDR). Five of these CpGs at 5% FDR could explain 14% of BMD variation. To test whether blood DNA methylation reflect the situation in bone (as shown for other tissues), an independent cohort was selected and BMD association was demonstrated in blood for 13 of the 63 CpGs. Four transcripts representing inhibitors of bone metabolism-MEPE, SOST, WIF1, and DKK1-showed correlation to a high number of methylated CpGs, at 5% FDR. Our results link DNA methylation to the genetic influence modifying the skeleton, and the data suggest a complex interaction between CpG methylation and gene regulation. This is the first study in the hitherto largest number of postmenopausal women to demonstrate a strong association among bone CpG methylation, transcript levels, and BMD/fracture. This new insight may have implications for evaluation of osteoporosis stage and susceptibility.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sjur Reppe"", ids = ""6658599""); list(name = ""Tonje G Lien"", ids = ""38597802""); list(name = ""Yiâ\200\220Hsiang Hsu"", ids = ""144488070""); list(name = ""Vigdis T.

7e1a385263f9eb4dc21c1f61bc94783815ca1049,No effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation on the skeletal muscle transcriptome in vitamin D deficient frail older adults,"ObjectiveVitamin D deficiency is common among older adults and has been linked to muscle weakness. Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a strategy to improve muscle function in older adults. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) on whole genome gene expression in skeletal muscle of vitamin D deficient frail older adults.MethodsA double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in vitamin D deficient frail older adults (aged above 65), characterized by blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations between 20 and 50â€‰nmol/L. Subjects were randomized across the placebo group and the calcifediol group (10â€‰Î¼g per day). Muscle biopsies were obtained before and after 6 months of calcifediol (nâ€‰=â€‰10) or placebo (nâ€‰=â€‰12) supplementation and subjected to whole genome gene expression profiling using Affymetrix HuGene 2.1ST arrays.ResultsExpression of the vitamin D receptor gene was virtually undetectable in human skeletal muscle biopsies, with Ct values exceeding 30. Blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels were significantly higher after calcifediol supplementation (87.3â€‰Â±â€‰20.6â€‰nmol/L) than after placebo (43.8â€‰Â±â€‰14.1â€‰nmol/L). No significant difference between treatment groups was observed on strength outcomes. The whole transcriptome effects of calcifediol and placebo were very weak, as indicated by the fact that correcting for multiple testing using false discovery rate did not yield any differentially expressed genes using any reasonable cut-offs (all q-values ~â€‰1). P-values were uniformly distributed across all genes, suggesting that low p-values are likely to be false positives. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis and principle component analysis was unable to separate treatment groups.ConclusionCalcifediol supplementation did not significantly affect the skeletal muscle transcriptome in frail older adults. Our findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation has no effects on skeletal muscle gene expression, suggesting that skeletal muscle may not be a direct target of vitamin D in older adults.Trial registrationThis study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02349282 on January 28, 2015.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Roland W.

a20ee5f9a2d17f6fa86a14dad3e4125fe04b365b,A two-genome microarray for the rice pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola and its use in the discovery of a difference in their regulation of hrp genes,"BackgroundXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) are bacterial pathogens of the worldwide staple and grass model, rice. Xoo and Xoc are closely related but Xoo invades rice vascular tissue to cause bacterial leaf blight, a serious disease of rice in many parts of the world, and Xoc colonizes the mesophyll parenchyma to cause bacterial leaf streak, a disease of emerging importance. Both pathogens depend on hrp genes for type III secretion to infect their host. We constructed a 50â€“70 mer oligonucleotide microarray based on available genome data for Xoo and Xoc and compared gene expression in Xoo strains PXO99A and Xoc strain BLS256 grown in the rich medium PSB vs. XOM2, a minimal medium previously reported to induce hrp genes in Xoo strain T7174.ResultsThree biological replicates of the microarray experiment to compare global gene expression in representative strains of Xoo and Xoc grown in PSB vs. XOM2 were carried out. The non-specific error rate and the correlation coefficients across biological replicates and among duplicate spots revealed that the microarray data were robust. 247 genes of Xoo and 39 genes of Xoc were differentially expressed in the two media with a false discovery rate of 5% and with a minimum fold-change of 1.75. Semi-quantitative-RT-PCR assays confirmed differential expression of each of 16 genes each for Xoo and Xoc selected for validation. The differentially expressed genes represent 17 functional categories.ConclusionWe describe here the construction and validation of a two-genome microarray for the two pathovars of X. oryzae. Microarray analysis revealed that using representative strains, a greater number of Xoo genes than Xoc genes are differentially expressed in XOM2 relative to PSB, and that these include hrp genes and other genes important in interactions with rice.

f46f16ec9ddb69dec6d594ccea38a51ea5e20312,Differentially Private False Discovery Rate Control,"Differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for privacy-preserving data analysis. This paper proposes the first differentially private procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing. Inspired by the Benjamini- Hochberg procedure (BHq), our approach is to first repeatedly add noise to the logarithms of the p-values to ensure differential privacy and to select an approximately smallest p-value serving as a promising candidate at each iteration; the selected p-values are further supplied to the BHq and our private procedure releases only the rejected ones. Apart from the privacy considerations, we develop a new technique that is based on a backward submartingale for proving FDR control of a broad class of multiple testing procedures, including our private procedure, and both the BHq step-up and step-down procedures. As a novel aspect, the proof works for arbitrary dependence between the true null and false null test statistics, while FDR control is maintained up to a small multiplicative factor. This theoretical guarantee is the first in the FDR literature to explain the empirical validity of the BHq procedure in three simulation studies.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Cynthia Dwork"", ids = ""1781565""); list(name = ""Weijie Su"", ids = ""145499378""); list(name = ""Li Zhang"", ids = ""40062432"")",aadb68f0e87801ce3845f3f2a0f4eb9c401847df; d0686c1edd5b143758a6e567d929eb00fda4eb3c; d385eadf84bc1ec6233d6ebe867c3b5f15681622; 4382f7ea8e46f91257b7de6beddc9a8d0eb9f4ff; d4cb420aa72886a726ea8232f56f6fe906c4d9fb; 3564f17d529d0acdca6a3e75bea4fa5fe3ff6a37; 04ed677647a2d124e1b8646bcb866885cbc4ef33,715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; af8997c39483bb804a514a64b550911472d39ec8; c731054eff2359cfc69e9d31a0b4527401545aca; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 8b06790cae439c734cc0ee7c4583bf65a4c07953; b57c54350769ffa59ff57f79ee5aad918844d298; 2c52b878f351e0efe34dce8795d8db5bbe4d0574; 947a0155e6463dc8a0b2422638b0d34dcc7d15d6; 0e2441103746d899fdb545d118771c711cda0dd7; f9a751c75d4fe2d3f747166be2cbee78e3910b50; d6b35fb82fe317200fa03c8e6f492fe396de769c; 2d24c621d5337e052bacb03d8a0951717037c2a4; edf27bb5272ea6fe244deb3bbc8da0429bfe3ac5; 9936915d6350168932a73984fb59b8456dea5821; f8558a09553fc35415b271019be9f7d44354073e; e4ce10063cd25447dcde75c2d9ce327446ced952; 83b60b919278bbf72a79cff23dce953a9d5b0110; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; c91a14f5a1f3d588c08e9db47093da3cf1c0a493; f0e93985fdc9fb3e0104da508768bb4680a9d4e8; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 79fb9e40fe0f901bdd9537639410195ee40d0aef; 1002c5b78ce0fc632bfb7d73bf1b67e735209fda; 4f906bfe6b28535b1d5bac2ac525bfabcf2d9369; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; e9a986c8ff6c2f381d026fe014f6aaa865f34da7; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; ea46d5e259e75d4822789b02689b8df70ef9329f; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; d0934cbfa608bb3e31e017cb7597e270c18c5edf; aaaae6628c9c33e165e5cd5538b27d9275c24347; 8c15b4e03ec7c9bcfaf7fb236c7884f0aeb41537; 1808b64aec21863489f0fe66f250890a3ac2b843; e2f64556ad275eb596b3e1ded98424630cc699aa; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; ab5a33452763ed55a7bbca2f54820ddc43fc2bd2; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 353797e36c56a7dbb4182fd9adea875e06e51c22; cb3ed67419285584c3b43d1881a0997855ed333e; 0821371dea070b0affe57547a2d04ee509bd7c0a; 8053ac54f2d45458bf4ce7b97bb8ecbab1514ff5; c91b19a556ce0d472cc08b3e06062b4c8220a277; ffb2a744ef64ee373068b6c23b31a9bb26c7c514; 0b9930266112c8b0684343f741cf83cf2b9a1da2; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 95686586f26d5a1d152db72f6283c7a73335a513; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; 0023582fde36430c7e3ae81611a14e558c8f4bae; 7414b5d0c96169599d97a02ac276ef8de77fca5e; 3e4b19cb672ae3d3bd1949cb76f0becbd88355d0; ce3ccde80ccaaa2225b6f495130aefb2cf436e18; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; 47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8; e4f5a51a0b08a5af6b69471599dfe2bdc1e8e55c; 3cf479f9dbfb7ed40b3e06b741197041a1965eec; c5a0ff2ce6c6e8e78f79fe98481aaafc0bdda417,ArXiv,abs/1807.04209,
8c862bf6901797930db5ead4a3b3bee4e3130239,Cerebral diffusion and perfusion deficits in North Sea divers,"Background: Diving is associated with a risk of cerebral decompression illness, and the prevalence of neurological symptoms is higher in divers compared with control groups. Microvascular dysfunction due to gas microembolism and exposure to hyperoxia are possible mechanisms, which may result in cerebral diffusion and perfusion deficits. Purpose: To investigate if possible functional derangements of the microvasculature and microstructure would be more prevalent among symptomatic divers. Material and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 91 former divers and 45 controls. Individual parametric images of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were generated on the basis of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging. To identify regions with statistically significant differences between groups (P < 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate), voxel-wise ANCOVA analysis was performed for each of the four parametric images. Results: Significant regional group differences were found in all four parametric comparisons. Gross regional ADC differences were seen throughout the brain, including large frontal and temporal white-matter regions, the hippocampus, and parts of the cerebellum.

Objective To study the molecular changes in synovial tissue preceding arthritis development in preclinical RA. Materials and methods Sixty-one individuals who were IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive and without any evidence of arthritis were included. All individuals underwent mini-arthroscopic synovial biopsy sampling of a knee joint at inclusion and were prospectively followed. An explorative genome-wide transcriptional profiling study was performed on synovial biopsies obtained from 13 individuals using Agilent arrays (test cohort). Survival analysis within the software package Significance Analysis of Microarrays was used to identify transcripts with a significant association with arthritis development. The expression level of differentially expressed genes was validated using quantitative real-time PCR in the total cohort. Results Six of the 13 individuals in the explorative study developed RA after a median follow up time of 20 months (IQR 2 â€“ 44). The 7 individuals who did not develop RA had a median follow up time of 56 months (IQR 56 â€“ 60). Using a False Discovery Rate of Conclusion This study clearly shows molecular changes appearing in synovial tissues before onset of arthritis in the absence of overt synovitis and demonstrates preclinical synovial activation of immune response genes associated with development of arthritis.,2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lgm van Baarsen"", ids = ""66307031""); list(name = ""Mjh de Hair"", ids = ""120796840""); list(name = ""Jf Semmelink"", ids = ""13305871""); list(name = ""Iy Choi"", ids = ""121787365""); list(name = ""Danielle M.

To find novel targets for study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), our team performed genome-wide analyses of lncRNA expression in 5 DLBCL cell lines using the 4*180K Agilent lncRNA Chip system, and in normal B cells. Five lncRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified via false discovery rate and fold-change filtering. Potential targets correlated with DLBCL were recognized via gene ontology and pathway analysis. Establishment of the co-expression network was done using Cytoscape. In total, 1053 lncRNAs and 4391 mRNAs were dysregulated in DLBCL cells, being comparing with normal B cells. The results suggested that the expressions of the 5 lncRNAs were consistent with the chip results. Several terms including the cell cycle, apoptosis, B cell receptor and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways were important in the progression of DLBCL. The chromosome locations of a few lncRNAs and the associated coexpressed genes were demonstrated by cis-regulatory gene analyses. The results of trans-analyses showed that multiple transcription factors regulated lncRNA and gene expression. Those outstanding lncRNAs in each group were implicated in the regulation of the TF-lncRNA-target gene network. Our study identified a set of lncRNAs differentially expressed in DLBCL cells.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danxia Zhu"", ids = ""4482465""); list(name = ""Cheng Fang"", ids = ""144655993""); list(name = ""Xiaodong Li"", ids = ""50080269""); list(name = ""Yiting Geng"", ids = ""8010928""); list(name = ""Ruiqi Li"", ids = ""47370459""); list(name = ""Chen Wu"", ids = ""143622133""); list(name = ""Jingting Jiang"", ids = ""4316975""); list(name = ""Changping Wu"", ids = ""46740631"")",69e6d4a734c000d088fefc23ffa0ddf89945311d; 9ec1975510feb5a6c78e586ba2307e0b11d68d97; 6e223795eda1deaafb471fa055fc6f48a4c4ff4a; 9bbd81400df04a650c4f33d1a4ea47fcb0058ac8; 7845b7ea891d97928dd33acfe2e84700ac5c0d13; 6dce25c06a00156b1a5ea14a6b3003cce92fded3,0c074b3f77333ab06757c8ce829c6bd574827dca; bd9f5cd82d9fa1768672c37a09a5bf6a1b7c7028; 746919373d5023ad8fd0ae95368338ef69b2f912; eda16eeaeea6dca09331749262ce8502948e0a83; 3bb275c6b7ba8dea44ca78108bf654089e08cc8e; e3f1dccef071579818df7b66e8759f683d21d9f0; 525188567707ec3a7c6448c4c4aedad591e5d7b1; 51a4a761ac9c47aeab4203b78043f3c50a5bbe83; af1659a6e486c23303df32c5bbf0d7506ed7b437; 2830cf5a89339af3ccf8cad2a31ac01e027ad2e4; 9aa6ec044b1ae9aed2f6c7c69706b90c3349d98c; fd7fc8c72df708cde024fe60651fc09fa9d1445f; 57acb91d43339480c7acc183547cf2cada1920a7; 2c8d573e7d1a814faa6f780ee08827b446a336e5; 3e9fcc0f895ee019e2b26244439ec8e693ceec3a; 0618542477467fb67c2218a906e376b2863d36e9; 0df283ff5c51c2fe0de5bbd369ea0b1b9824a035; a7e133d7f3bade75a316baf40d1efcf8b22cee14; 571206793957c77d96b4a832300ef5101dc02fd7; fd0df2a85e6d3687e3df7d436f793342be63c54a; bed435222ddb9e9390677ad3eef22422468512e8; db8f976d3d49b74ce586bf40652f9875563adfe9; 185114544cd3eaf01c788a12b31666bc475e4bad; 838a1e5ba697fa117564d65c12adc93a247b1da8; e1116b11942edae6ecd28bea3964459a3443e8bc; f8b15b2af1e484486a21b7b23c651833e3fe1397; 4ebc2369f1385a998945e8a8dbe536e986dc8e30; e3ed55bf8d8048dc06703fdf61ed245f097b7324,Oncotarget,8,23228 - 23236
c598237c8111d307b7134026e1011970e1200ba8,Gene Expression Pathways That Distinguish Diagnosis and Relapse in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"In contrast to the excellent outcomes for children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), outcomes following ALL marrow relapse have remained poor despite incremental increases in the intensity of therapy. Those children whose relapse occurs after therapy is completed (late relapse; >36 months from diagnosis) have a much better outcome than those who relapse during therapy (early relapse; â‰¤36 months). To discover differences in the underlying biological mechanisms of treatment failure we have extended our study of gene expression profiling to patients who experienced their first bone marrow relapse in whom matched pairs of marrow samples from both initial diagnosis and initial marrow relapse were available (30 pairs). These children were treated on contemporary cooperative group studies over the past six years. Twenty patients had relapsed early while ten had relapsed late. Affymetrix U133A microarrays were used and data was normalized, filtered and analyzed. In an unsupervised analysis (hierarchical clustering), we observed that the diagnosis and relapse samples of individual patients who relapsed early tended to cluster together (median correlation coefficient = 0.38) while the diagnosis and relapse samples from the patients who relapsed late were more divergent (median correlation coefficient = 0.03). Using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) many genes were identified that were commonly deregulated at relapse compared to initial diagnosis (459 probe sets with a false discovery rate (FDR) Analysis of matched diagnosis and relapse pairs have identified candidate pathways that may mediate drug resistance and suggests that agents that target the cell cycle regulatory pathway may have particular efficacy in ALL cases that relapse early. Documentation of their direct role in this process by modulation of expression in preclinical model systems will identify opportunities for rationale design of new therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat relapse.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Deepa Bhojwani"", ids = ""49326305""); list(name = ""Elizabeth A.

9b8bbbb5603971f47386b9cbe65854dbdcf20e54,"Deep transcriptome sequencing reveals differences in global gene expression between normal and pale, soft, and exudative turkey meat.","Previous studies from our laboratory suggested that differential expression of genes between normal and pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) turkey is associated with development of the PSE syndrome. However, a detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of this meat defect remains unclear. The objective of this study was to extend and complement our previous work by using deep transcriptome RNA sequence analysis to compare the respective transcriptome profiles and identify molecular mechanisms responsible for the etiology of PSE turkey meat. Turkey breasts (n = 43) were previously classified as normal or PSE using marinade uptake as an indicator of quality (high = normal; low = PSE). Total RNA from breast muscle samples with the highest (n = 4) and lowest (n = 4) marinade uptake were isolated and sequenced using the Illumina GA(IIX) platform. The results indicated differential expression of 494 loci (false discovery rate < 0.05). Changes in gene expression were confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes suggested abnormalities of calcium homeostasis and signaling pathways regulating actin cytoskeleton structure as well as carbohydrate metabolism and energy production in PSE samples. Dysregulation of postmortem glucose oxidation in PSE turkey was suggested by both dramatic downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4 (PDK4) mRNA, the most downregulated gene, and a decrease in the protein product (P = 0.0007) as determined by immunoblot analysis. These results support the hypothesis that differential expression of several genes and their protein products contribute to development of PSE turkey.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yuwares Malila"", ids = ""5863033""); list(name = ""Kristen M Carr"", ids = ""3909546""); list(name = ""Catherine W.

b78fcfcb4b3c6ebef2dc2e9b3b6f6089caa7827c,Age-related gene expression profiles of immature human oocytes,"STUDY QUESTION
What is the difference between the gene expression profiles of single human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes from women of different ages?


SUMMARY ANSWER
There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression profiles of human GV oocytes from women of different ages (range: 25-43).


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
It is well established that reproductive capacity declines as women age, which is attributed to oocyte quality since this decline is counterbalanced in older women receiving young donor oocytes. Altered gene expression of human oocytes at different stages of development in relation to female age is one of the suggested mechanisms that could explain the decrease in oocyte quality.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
Between 2012 and 2014, 40 human GV oocytes of 40 women were obtained during follicular aspiration as part of routine ICSI treatment. Gene expression profiles of 38 GV oocytes were determined in four different age groups: 25-30, 31-35, 36-38 and 39-43 years of age.


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
GV oocytes were donated for research and frozen between 3.5 and 7.5 h after follicular aspiration. Subsequently, GV oocytes were thawed and prepared for gene expression profile analysis using Agilent microarrays containing ~42 000 Human Gene Expression probe-sets. Gene expression profiles were visualized by hierarchical clustering and the top 500 most differing genes were determined by multidimensional scaling (MDS). Transcripts were analysed in a class comparison between the four age groups and for indicators of biological age: antral follicle count (AFC) and the total dosage of FSH needed for ovarian stimulation. Individual transcripts were analysed using linear regression. A false discovery rate <0.05 was considered statistically significant.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Visualization of gene expression profiles of GV oocytes with hierarchal clustering and MDS demonstrated no clear grouping of samples based on female age, AFC or FSH dosage. The gene expression profile of GV oocytes classified in four age groups revealed no significantly differentially expressed genes between the four different age groups. There were also no significantly differentially expressed genes in the linear regression analysis for individual transcripts against age.


LARGE SCALE DATA
Not applicable.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
Immature (GV) oocytes obtained from ovarian stimulation cycles were used. Findings may therefore differ for oocytes at other developmental stages and for in-vivo matured oocytes under physiological conditions. Due to our relatively large, but still limited study sample (40 GV oocytes), we cannot exclude that there might be smaller age-related gene-expression differences, i.e. due to a lack of power.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
We did not find an effect of female age on gene expression profiles of individual human GV oocytes. Other studies have suggested that gene-expression profiles are affected in mature oocytes, which might imply that female age affects oocyte maturation. Alternatively, other mechanisms in human oocytes might cause the age-related fertility decline.

4a4d7ebc8f58713799d96cda74ac86b6e886a5e7,Genome-Wide Association for Growth Traits in Canchim Beef Cattle,"Studies are being conducted on the applicability of genomic data to improve the accuracy of the selection process in livestock, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide valuable information to enhance the understanding on the genetics of complex traits. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions and genes that play roles in birth weight (BW), weaning weight adjusted for 210 days of age (WW), and long-yearling weight adjusted for 420 days of age (LYW) in Canchim cattle. GWAS were performed by means of the Generalized Quasi-Likelihood Score (GQLS) method using genotypes from the BovineHD BeadChip and estimated breeding values for BW, WW, and LYW. Data consisted of 285 animals from the Canchim breed and 114 from the MA genetic group (derived from crossings between Charolais sires and Â½ Canchim + Â½ Zebu dams). After applying a false discovery rate correction at a 10% significance level, a total of 4, 12, and 10 SNPs were significantly associated with BW, WW, and LYW, respectively. These SNPs were surveyed to their corresponding genes or to surrounding genes within a distance of 250 kb. The genes DPP6 (dipeptidyl-peptidase 6) and CLEC3B (C-type lectin domain family 3 member B) were highlighted, considering its functions on the development of the brain and skeletal system, respectively. The GQLS method identified regions on chromosome associated with birth weight, weaning weight, and long-yearling weight in Canchim and MA animals. New candidate regions for body weight traits were detected and some of them have interesting biological functions, of which most have not been previously reported. The observation of QTL reports for body weight traits, covering areas surrounding the genes (SNPs) herein identified provides more evidence for these associations. Future studies targeting these areas could provide further knowledge to uncover the genetic architecture underlying growth traits in Canchim cattle.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Marcos Eli Buzanskas"", ids = ""6509300""); list(name = ""Daniela do Amaral Grossi"", ids = ""37686472""); list(name = ""Ricardo Vieira Ventura"", ids = ""33322605""); list(name = ""Flavio S.

1cfdb71f7b72634daea995a5225fbe4c052e565a,Functional Empirical Bayes Methods for Identifying Genes with Different Time-course Expression Profiles,"Time course studies of gene expression are essential in biomedical research to understand biological phenomena that evolve in a temporal fashion. Microarray technology makes it possible to study genome-wide temporal differences in gene expression profiles between different experimental conditions/groups. In this paper, we introduce a functional hierarchical model and empirical Bayes approach to model gene expression trajectories over time and to detect temporally differentially expressed (TDE) genes. Monte Carlo EM algorithm is developed for estimating both the gene-specific parameters and the hyperparameters. We use the posterior probability based false discovery rate (FDR) criterion to identify the TDE genes in order to control for the over FDR. We illustrate the methods by using both simulated data sets and a data set from a microarray based gene expression time course study of C. elegans developmental processes. Simulation results suggested that the procedure have low false discovery rate but could potentially have high false negative rate when the noise variance is relatively large. Results from both simulations and analysis of C. elegans data indicated that the procedure performed better than the two-way ANOVA in identifying TDE genes between the dauer exit process and starved L1 worms response to feeding process.",2004,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Fangxin Hong"", ids = ""37491437""); list(name = ""Hongzhe Li"", ids = ""47892909"")",fd42372af68fc9c253f27cf25cba3806685b7dc1; e7528f9b7b4ee21a54589bda731a59b604d39deb,,,,

Ubiquitin was selected as a post-translational modification of interest because it is known to play a determinant role in the endosomal trafficking that culminates in exosome release. Enrichment was achieved by two immunoprecipitations, first at the protein level and subsequently at the peptide level. Fifty ubiquitinated proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry filtering at a 5% spectral false discovery rate and using the conservative requirement that glycinylglycine-modified lysine residues were observed in tryptic peptides. Thirty five of these proteins have not previously been reported to be ubiquitinated. The ubiquitinated cohort spans a range of protein sizes and favors basic pI values and hydrophobicity.

8368d2faa4413cab978eb6c876fd7f5f1ba36554,MYORG is associated with recessive primary familial brain calcification,"Objective
To investigate the genetic basis of the recessive form of primary familial brain calcification and study pathways linking a novel gene with known dominant genes that cause the disease.


Methods
Whole exome sequencing and Sanger-based segregation analysis were used to identify possible disease causing mutations. Mutation pathogenicity was validated by structural protein modeling. Functional associations between the candidate gene, MYORG, and genes previously implicated in the disease were examined through phylogenetic profiling.


Results
We studied nine affected individuals from two unrelated families of Middle Eastern origin. The median age of symptom onset was 29.5 years (range 21-57 years) and dysarthria was the most common presenting symptom. We identified in the MYORG gene, a homozygous c.1233delC mutation in one family and c.1060_1062delGAC mutation in another. The first mutation results in protein truncation and the second in deletion of a highly conserved aspartic acid that is likely to disrupt binding of the protein with its substrate. Phylogenetic profiling analysis of the MYORG protein sequence suggests co-evolution with a number of calcium channels as well as other proteins related to regulation of anion transmembrane transport (False Discovery Rate, FDR < 10-8) and with PDCD6IP, a protein interacting with PDGFR Î² which is known to be involved in the disease.

Due to myelofibrosis and the age at presentation, patient samples are scarce. We generated Human Erythroid Leukemia (HEL) cell derived cell lines with tet-inducible OTT, MKL1 and OTT-MKL1 to further elucidate the function of the respective proteins. HEL cells can be induced to differentiate down the megakaryocyte lineage by TPA. Induction with doxycycline resulted in transcription and translation of the respective genes within hours. While overexpression of MKL1 led to enhancement of megakaryocytic differentiation, both OTT and OTT-MKL1 overexpression led to cell death over the course of several days by apoptosis as evident by staining for Annexin V and morphology. The apoptotic cell death was greatly enhanced by concomitant induction of differentiation by TPA. We performed microarray analysis comparing uninduced and 8-hour tet-induced samples in the presence or absence of TPA.

916f26d4f2b41e55dbaef38867b1d5e3b5c7499b,Comparison between an abbreviated and full MRI protocol for detecting additional disease when doing breast cancer staging.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have shown that abbreviated magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) compares well to full-protocol MRI (fpMRI) in breast cancer (BC) screening, with the potential advantage of a less costly and complex examination. To our knowledge, the role for aMRI in staging BC has been poorly investigated, especially in assessing additional disease (ie, additional lesions compared to the index one prompting the examination).


PURPOSE
To compare aMRI and fpMRI in detecting additional disease in BC staging.


STUDY TYPE
Retrospective monocentric cohort study.


POPULATION
In all, 87 patients with 89 biopsy-proven index lesions referred to staging fpMRI between January-June 2016.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
A 1.5T magnet using short tau inversion recovery (STIR) T2 -weighted imaging, echoplanar diffusion-weighted imaging, and 3D fast long angle shot (FLASH) T1 -weighted imaging.


ASSESSMENT
During independent sessions, four readers with 1.5-20 years of experience in breast imaging, blinded to the pathological examination and previous imaging, assessed multifocal, multicentric, and contralateral additional lesions on fpMRI and aMRI (including precontrast T1 -weighted 3D FLASH sequence, first postcontrast subtracted T1 -weighted 3D FLASH sequence, and a transverse maximum intensity projection reconstruction).


STATISTICAL TESTS
We calculated the per-lesion cancer detection rate (CDR), positive predictive value (PPV), and false discovery rate (FDR) for additional disease, assessing the significance of intrareader differences in CDR with the McNemar test.


RESULTS
Pathological analysis found 36 additional lesions (multifocal, multicentric, and contralateral in 20, 15, and 1 cases, respectively). Readers' CDR was comparably high using aMRI (range 88.9-94.4%) or fpMRI (range 91.7-94.4%) (P > 0.05). PPV and FDR of aMRI (ranges 76.2-84.6% and 15.4-23.8%, respectively), and fpMRI (ranges 76.7-82.9% and 17.2-23.3%, respectively) were comparable on an intrareader basis. Using aMRI, two out of four readers induced two false-negative cases (one case each) with presumably limited impact on surgical planning (multifocal cancers <1â€‰cm in size). DATA CONCLUSION: aMRI was comparable to fpMRI in staging additional BC.

Techniques to rapidly and precisely detect and quantify GA would appear to be of critical importance in advancing the understanding of its pathogenesis. In this study, we develop an automated supervised classification system using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmenting GA in fundus autofluorescene (FAF) images. More specifically, to enhance the contrast of GA relative to the background, we apply the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. Blood vessels may cause GA segmentation errors due to similar intensity level to GA. A tensor-voting technique is performed to identify the blood vessels and a vessel inpainting technique is applied to suppress the GA segmentation errors due to the blood vessels. To handle the large variation of GA lesion sizes, three deep CNNs with three varying sized input image patches are applied. Fifty randomly chosen FAF images are obtained from fifty subjects with GA. The algorithm-defined GA regions are compared with manual delineation by a certified grader. A two-fold cross-validation is applied to evaluate the algorithm performance. The mean segmentation accuracy, true positive rate (i.e. sensitivity), true negative rate (i.e. specificity), positive predictive value, false discovery rate, and overlap ratio, between the algorithm- and manually-defined GA regions are 0.97 Â± 0.02, 0.89 Â± 0.08, 0.98 Â± 0.02, 0.87 Â± 0.12, 0.13 Â± 0.12, and 0.79 Â± 0.12 respectively, demonstrating a high level of agreement.",2018,Engineering; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhihong Hu"", ids = ""46919512""); list(name = ""Ziyuan Wang"", ids = ""2823750""); list(name = ""Srinivas R.

This paper proposes a ""mode matching"" method for fitting an empirical null when the theoretical null belongs to any exponential family. Based on the central matching method for z-scores, mode matching estimates the null density by fitting an appropriate exponential family to the histogram of the test statistics by Poisson regression in a region surrounding the mode. The empirical null estimate is then used to estimate local and tail false discovery rate (FDR) for inference. Delta-method covariance formulas and approximate asymptotic bias formulas are provided, as well as simulation studies of the effect of the tuning parameters of the procedure on the bias-variance trade-off. The standard FDR estimates are found to be biased down at the far tails. Correlation between test statistics is taken into account in the covariance estimates, providing a generalization of Efron's ""wing function"" for exponential families.

7cceff747f924877526b56542a42d04969ac2161,Proteomes and Ubiquitylomes Analysis Reveals the Involvement of Ubiquitination in Protein Degradation in Petunias.,"Petal senescence is a complex programmed process. It has been demonstrated previously that treatment with ethylene, a plant hormone involved in senescence, can extensively alter transcriptome and proteome profiles in plants. However, little is known regarding the impact of ethylene on posttranslational modification (PTM) or the association between PTM and the proteome. Protein degradation is one of the hallmarks of senescence, and ubiquitination, a major PTM in eukaryotes, plays important roles in protein degradation. In this study, we first obtained reference petunia (Petunia hybrida) transcriptome data via RNA sequencing. Next, we quantitatively investigated the petunia proteome and ubiquitylome and the association between them in petunia corollas following ethylene treatment. In total, 51,799 unigenes, 3,606 proteins, and 2,270 ubiquitination sites were quantified 16 h after ethylene treatment. Treatment with ethylene resulted in 14,448 down-regulated and 6,303 up-regulated unigenes (absolute log2 fold change > 1 and false discovery rate < 0.001), 284 down-regulated and 233 up-regulated proteins, and 320 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated ubiquitination sites using a 1.5-fold threshold (P < 0.05), indicating that global ubiquitination levels increase during ethylene-mediated corolla senescence in petunia. Several putative ubiquitin ligases were up-regulated at the protein and transcription levels. Our results showed that the global proteome and ubiquitylome were negatively correlated and that ubiquitination could be involved in the degradation of proteins during ethylene-mediated corolla senescence in petunia. Ethylene regulates hormone signaling transduction pathways at both the protein and ubiquitination levels in petunia corollas. In addition, our results revealed that ethylene increases the ubiquitination levels of proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianhang Guo"", ids = ""15563091""); list(name = ""Juanxu Liu"", ids = ""6229886""); list(name = ""Qian Qian Wei"", ids = ""49988428""); list(name = ""Rongmin Wang"", ids = ""46886054""); list(name = ""Weiyuan Yang"", ids = ""6207365""); list(name = ""Yueyue Ma"", ids = ""47009604""); list(name = ""Guoju Chen"", ids = ""8018411""); list(name = ""Yixun Yu"", ids = ""5575732"")",e4f92752ae09102cf035a506d214dbc84cd8da40; 697aca0610654333cce71226a381dca73af7ec94; a168fa121d32f04caaa0dfe2f4e25fffc5ec3fb6; 52f78e7ed0b8f980e9a94e33075838400ef6bdda; 89dea3ca4033a6d2c9f9122678ccbeaa507f56d3; 42f54bc292da3ab4575dd376a76d25e325078d30; 1468435c7e15522d291bef9adba01fbdbd5ed1b0; 868e3369947b12d8db1b8d1d85b77d2ce93a5f46; 08ce556401d0f49bb585d90734c7722cb905d70f; bd0e34df9529b4b11c2fd3c68d07aaaa3af5aaae,,Plant physiology,173 1,"

In this prospective cohort study, high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) was employed to analyze serum samples obtained from patients at risk of stroke (n = 99) and non-risk controls (n = 301). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with univariate analysis using a false discovery rate (FDR) of q = 0.05 were employed to identify the discriminant metabolic profiles and to determine significantly different metabolites between healthy control and stroke risk groups. PLS-DA satisfactorily separated the stroke risk sera from control sera. Additionally, these discriminant metabolic profiles were not related to hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, or insulin sensitivity. A group of 35 metabolites, most of them amino acids, that were capable of discriminating stroke risk sera from controls were identified using untargeted metabolomics. Further, the targeted metabolomics approach confirmed that the quantified concentrations of l-tryptophan, 3-methoxytyramine, methionine, homocysteinesulfinic acid, cysteine, isoleucine, carnitine, arginine, linoleic acid, and sphingosine were specifically elevated in the sera of patients who were later diagnosed with stroke.

bb7dd15bd2e6d008443c2546db77b63a01d57bbd,Decoy methods for assessing false positives and false discovery rates in shotgun proteomics.,"The potential of getting a significant number of false positives (FPs) in peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained by proteomic database search has been well-recognized. Among the attempts to assess FPs, the concomitant use of target and decoy databases is widely practiced. By adjusting filtering criteria, FPs and false discovery rate (FDR) can be controlled at a desired level. Although the target-decoy approach is gaining in popularity, subtle differences in decoy construction (e.g., reversing vs stochastic methods), rate calculation (e.g., total vs unique PSMs), or searching (separate vs composite) do exist among various implementations. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of these differences on FP and FDR estimations using a rat kidney protein sample and the SEQUEST search engine as an example. On the effects of decoy construction, we found that, when a single scoring filter (XCorr) was used, stochastic methods generated a higher estimation of FPs and FDR than sequence reversing methods, likely due to an increase in unique peptides. This higher estimation could largely be attenuated by creating decoy databases similar in effective size but not by a simple normalization with a unique-peptide coefficient. When multiple filters were applied, the differences seen between reversing and stochastic methods significantly diminished, suggesting multiple filterings reduce the dependency on how a decoy is constructed. For a fixed set of filtering criteria, FDR and FPs estimated by using unique PSMs were almost twice those using total PSMs. The higher estimation seemed to be dependent on data acquisition setup. As to the differences between performing separate or composite searches, in general, FDR estimated from the separate search was about three times that from the composite search. The degree of difference gradually decreased as the filtering criteria became more stringent. Paradoxically, the estimated true positives in separate search were higher when multiple filters were used. By analyzing a standard protein mixture, we demonstrated that the higher estimation of FDR and FPs in the separate search likely reflected an overestimation, which could be corrected with a simple merging procedure. Our study illustrates the relative merits of different implementations of the target-decoy strategy, which should be worth contemplating when large-scale proteomic biomarker discovery is to be attempted.",2009,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Guanghui Wang"", ids = ""34953270""); list(name = ""Wells W.

4ea739de70f3f34c71d3ed0fb3ca0d81560cafb0,Segregation of HPV-positive vulvar neoplastic lesions by an anal cancer progression methylation signature,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been implicated in the development of different cancers and has been associated with genome-wide epigenetic alterations. We have demonstrated an 86-gene methylomic signature to be associated with the progression of anal cancer (AC) from normal mucosa. The signature is also able to classify AIN3 as either cancer-like or normal-like. We sought to evaluate whether this AC signature is applicable to HPV-associated vulvar cancer (VC) progression. Methods Our 16 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded study specimens consisted of 8 VC, 6 VIN3, and 2 normal vulvar tissues (NV). Extracted DNA was subjected to HPV genotyping (SPF10-LiPA25 kit) as well as genome-wide methylation profiling (Illumina Methylation EPIC array). Differential methylation was defined by false discovery rate of 0.3. The AC methylation signature was applied to vulvar tissues. Results All 16 tissues except for one VC were found to be HPV+. By principal components analysis, distinct separations between NV, VIN3 and VC were observed. Application of the AC signature to the vulvar tissues demonstrated strong separation of NV and VC cases with segregation of VIN3 cases into normal-like (n=2) and cancer-like (n=4) types. By both analyses, the HPV-negative VC case presented as a distinct outlier. Conclusions Methylomic alterations can distinguish between HPV+ NV, VIN3 and VC. Successful segregation of vulvar lesions by an AC signature suggests that HPV-driven oncogenesis may be associated with similar methylation events across different tissue types. Our findings may have implications for development of shared early detection and prevention biomarkers.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Abidemi Ajidahun"", ids = ""49599896""); list(name = ""Leah E.

c208cac172c36852c0600d2d468dfe2d5637ec2b,An Algorithm for Early Outbreak Detection in Multiple Data Streams,"Objective To propose a computationally simple, fast, and reliable temporal method for early event detection in multiple data streams Introduction Current biosurveillance systems run multiple univariate statistical process control (SPC) charts to detect increases in multiple data streams 1 . The method of using multiple univariate SPC charts is easy to implement and easy to interpret. By examining alarms from each control chart, it is easy to identify which data stream is causing the alarm. However, testing multiple data streams simultaneously can lead to multiple testing problems that inflate the combined false alarm probability. Although methods such as the Bonferroni correction can be applied to address the multiple testing problem by lowering the false alarm probability in each control chart, these approaches can be extremely conservative. Biosurveillance systems often make use of variations of popular univariate SPC charts such as the Shewart Chart, the cumulative sum chart (CUSUM), and the exponentially weighted moving average chart (EWMA). In these control charts an alarm is signaled when the charting statistic exceeds a pre-defined control limit. With the standard SPC charts, the false alarm rate is specified using the in-control average run length ( ARL 0 ). If multiple charts are used, the resulting multiple testing problem is often addressed using family-wise error rate (FWER) based methods â€“ that are known to be conservative - for error control. A new temporal method is proposed for early event detection in multiple data streams. The proposed method uses p-values instead of the control limits that are commonly used with standard SPC charts. In addition, the proposed method uses false discovery rate (FDR) for error control over the standard ARL 0 used with conventional SPC charts. With the use of FDR for error control, the proposed method makes use of more powerful and up-to-date procedures for handling the multiple testing problem than FWER-based methods. Methods The proposed method can be applied to multiple univariate CUSUM or EWMA control charts. It can also be applied to a variation of the Hotelling T 2 chart which is a common multivariate process monitoring method. The Hotelling T 2 chart is analogous to the Shewart chart. Montgomery et. al 2 proposed a variation of the Hotelling T 2 chart where the T 2 statistic is decomposed into components that reflect the contribution of each data stream. First, a tolerable FDR level specified. Then, at each new time step disease counts from each of the m geographic regions Y 1t , Y 2t , â€¦ , Y mt are collected. These disease counts are used to calculate the charting statistics S 1t , S 2t , â€¦ , S mt for each region. Meanwhile by inspecting historical data from each region, a non-outbreak period is identified. Using data from the non-outbreak period, bootstrap samples are drawn with replacement from each region and charting statistics are calculated. Using the charting statistics, empirical non-outbreak distributions are generated for each region. With the empirical non-outbreak distributions and the current charting statistic for each region S 1t , S 2t , â€¦ , S mt , corresponding p-values p 1t , p 2t , â€¦ , p mt are calculated. The multiple testing problem that occurs in comparing multiple p-values simultaneously is handled using the Storey -Tibshirani multiple comparison procedure 3 to signal alarms. Results As an illustration, all three methods â€“ EWMA, CUSUM, and Hotelling T 2 (components) - were applied to a data set consisting of weekly disease count data from 16 German federal sates gathered over a 11 year period from 2004-2014. The first two years of data from 2004-2005 were used to calibrate the model. Figure 1 shows the results for the state of Rhineland Palatinate. The three plots in Figure 1 show (a) the weekly disease counts for Rhineland Palatinate (b) the EWMA statistic (shown in red), the CUSUM statistic (shown in dark green) and (c) the component of the Hotelling T 2 statistic corresponding to the illustrated state (shown in blue). The actual outbreak occurred on week 306 (shown by the orange line). Notice the two false alarms â€“ alarms that occur before week 306 - with the Hotelling T 2 statistic (dark green) on weeks 34 and 292; similarly, the CUSUM statistic signals a false alarm on week 57. However, the EWMA statistic does not signal any false alarms before the outbreak (red). Figure 2 zooms on the alarm statistics for the time period from weeks 280 â€“ 330. The Hotelling T 2 statistic misses the onset of actual outbreak on week 306. The CUSUM statistic detects the outbreak on week 307 â€“ one week later. However, the EWMA statistic detects the outbreak right at the onset on week 306. Conclusions Extensive simulation studies were conducted to compare the performance of the three control charts. Performance was compared in terms of (i) speed of detection and (ii) false alarm rates. Simulation results provide convincing evidence that the EWMA and the CUSUM are considerably speedier in detecting outbreaks compared to Hotelling T 2 statistic: compared to the CUSUM, the EWMA is relatively faster. Similarly, the false alarm rates are larger for Hotelling T 2 statistic compared to the EWMA and the CUSUM: false alarms are rare with both the EWMA and the CUSUM statistics with EWMA statistic having a slight edge. Overall, EWMA has the best performance out of the three methods with the new algorithm. Thus, the new algorithm applied to the EWMA statistic provides a simple, fast, and a reliable method for early event detection in multiple data streams. References 1. Fricker RD.

In this article we discuss statistical methods for the analysis of somatic mutation frequency data generated in these studies. We place special emphasis on a two-stage study design introduced by Sj\""{o}blom et al. [Science 314 (2006) 268--274]. In this context, we describe and compare statistical methods for constructing scores that can be used to prioritize candidate genes for further investigation and to assess the statistical significance of the candidates thus identified. Controversy has surrounded the reliability of the false discovery rates estimates provided by the approximations used in early cancer genome studies. To address these, we develop a semiparametric Bayesian model that provides an accurate fit to the data. We use this model to generate a large collection of realistic scenarios, and evaluate alternative approaches on this collection. Our assessment is impartial in that the model used for generating data is not used by any of the approaches compared. And is objective, in that the scenarios are generated by a model that fits data. Our results quantify the conservative control of the false discovery rate with the Benjamini and Hockberg method compared to the empirical Bayes approach and the multiple testing method proposed in Storey [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 64 (2002) 479--498]. Simulation results also show a negligible departure from the target false discovery rate for the methodology used in Sj\""{o}blom et al.

Metabolome profiling is used to identify biomarkers for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Previous studies compared metabolite profiles in AIS and healthy controls, which did not account for factors that affect metabolome (genetics, medications). This pilot project evaluates the change in metabolite concentrations between the acute and chronic stage of stroke in the same cohort in order to minimize other factors impact.


METHODS
We performed global metabolome profile on serum of 20 and urine of 12 stroke patients in acute (72 hours) and chronic (3-5.2 months) stage and compared relative peak values using Wilcoxon and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis methods. Chronic stage metabolite concentrations were considered baseline. We performed analysis to identify significantly overrepresented pathways using MetaboAnalyst.


RESULTS
Three serum metabolites asparagine (Pâ€¯=â€¯.045), tyrosine (Pâ€¯=â€¯.015), and xylose (Pâ€¯=â€¯.003) had significantly higher concentrations in acute stage. Seven out of top 10 serum metabolites ranked by Wilcoxon test P value were related to amino acid (AA) metabolism. Two urine metabolites glycine (Pâ€¯=â€¯.03) and acetylcarnitine (Pâ€¯=â€¯.05) had significantly different concentrations in the acute stage. Five of the top 10 urine metabolites related to AA metabolism. We identified 6 significant pathways after false discovery rate correction that were upregulated in the acute stage: (1) Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis, (2) nitrogen, (3) alanine, aspartate, and glutamate, (4) branched-chain AA, (5) arginine and proline, and (6) phenylalanine metabolism.


CONCLUSION
Longitudinal study design confirms that AA metabolism heavily involved in the pathophysiology of acute brain ischemia.

5074cc3f06cc462234777e74338ad39f504da23d,Dual functions of Tet 1 in transcriptional regulation in mouse embryonic stem cells,"Epigenetic modification of the mammalian genome by DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) has a profound impact on chromatin structure, gene expression and maintenance of cellular identity. The recent demonstration that members of the Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family of proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine raised the possibility that Tet proteins are capable of establishing a distinct epigenetic state. We have recently demonstrated that Tet1 is specifically expressed in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and is required for ES cell maintenance. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with highthroughput DNA sequencing, here we show in mouse ES cells that Tet1 is preferentially bound to CpG-rich sequences at promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes. Despite an increase in levels of DNA methylation at many Tet1binding sites, Tet1 depletion does not lead to downregulation of all the Tet1 targets. Interestingly, although Tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation is required for maintaining the expression of a group of transcriptionally active genes, it is also involved in repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1 contributes to silencing of this group of genes by facilitating recruitment of PRC2 to CpG-rich gene promoters. Thus, our study not only establishes a role for Tet1 in modulating DNA methylation levels at CpG-rich promoters, but also reveals a dual function of Tet1 in promoting transcription of pluripotency factors as well as participating in the repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. The Tet protein family includes three members (Tet1â€“3), all of which have the capacity to convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in a 2-oxoglutarateand Fe(II)dependent manner. Consistent with the relative enrichment of 5hmC in ES cells, Tet1 is highly expressed in undifferentiated ES cells and Tet1 messenger RNA levels decrease upon ES cell differentiation. Lentiviral-mediated depletion of Tet1 in mouse E14 ES cells cultured under feeder-free conditions leads to phenotypic changes that include partial loss of alkaline phosphatase activity and SSEA1 immunoreactivity, decreased self-renewal capacity and proliferation rate, downregulation of pluripotency factor Nanog and upregulation of differentiation genes (for example, lineage markers for trophectorderm and primitive endoderm in a subset of cells). Thus, Tet1 may be required for mouse ES cell maintenance. To gain insights into the mechanism by which Tet1 contributes to ES cell function, we investigated the genome-wide distribution of Tet1 in mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with highthroughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) using a highly specific Tet1 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Analysis of replicate ChIP-seq experiments identified a total of 35,564 binding sites with high confidence (P , 10, or false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, parallel experiments using rabbit IgG did not yield specific enrichment (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Moreover, ChIP-seq analysis also indicated that Tet1 occupancy was generally reduced in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted Tet1-depleted ES cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a). ChIP followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis further confirmed decreased Tet1 occupancy on randomly selected Tet1-binding sites in response to Tet1 depletion (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Most Tet1 binding sites are located in gene-rich euchromatic regions, as 79.8% of all Tet1-bound loci are within intragenic regions or 5 kb intergenic regions upor downstream of annotated genes (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Similar to other CXXC zinc-fingerdomain-containing proteins (for example, Cfp1 and Kdm2a), Tet1 is enriched (86.6%) at CpG islands (Fig. 1aâ€“c). Consistently, de novo motif discovery analysis identified a CpG-rich sequence as the highest ranking motif within Tet1-bound regions (Fig. 1d). Quantification of CpG density within Tet1-binding loci indicated that, similar to Kdm2a (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b), Tet1 occupancy positively correlates with CpG density (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Collectively, the above results indicate that Tet1 high-affinity binding sites are generally enriched for CpG-rich sequences. Because Tet proteins are capable of converting 5mC to 5hmC, we investigated the relationship between Tet1 occupancy and DNA methylation in mouse ES cells using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with mouse whole-genome tiling microarrays (MeDIP-chip). We found that DNA methylation is generally excluded from transcription start sites (TSSs) of Tet1-bound gene promoters (Fig. 2a, blue line in left panel). In contrast, Tet1-unbound gene promoters are frequently DNA methylated (Fig. 2a, red line in left panel). These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that CpG-rich gene promoters, where Tet1 is enriched (Fig. 1), are generally hypomethylated. Further analysis indicates that CpG islands not bound by Tet1 are associated with higher 5mC levels compared to Tet1-bound CpG islands (Fig. 2a, right panel). Thus, Tet1 occupancy at gene promoters is inversely correlated to levels of DNA methylation. To investigate whether Tet1 is required for maintaining the hypomethylated state at Tet1-bound regions, we analysed DNA methylation profiles in Tet1-depleted ES cells and demonstrated that Tet1 deficiency led to a general increase in 5mC levels at both TSSs and genomic regions flanking the proximal promoters of CpG-rich genes (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). An increase in 5mC levels was also detected within proximal promoter regions of a subset of CpG-poor gene promoters (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). The observed 5mC changes in Tet1-depleted cells were not due to interarray variations as a co-hybridization strategy analysing biologically independent replicates also revealed that the increase in 5mC levels induced by Tet1 deficiency was generally enriched at Tet1-binding sites (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 2). Locus-specific bisulphite sequencing confirmed that Tet1-binding sites and their surrounding",2011,,"list(name = ""Hao Wu"", ids = ""2610469""); list(name = ""Ana C.

e4d81c752877fc01f78485207157604e567c272d,Four essays in quantitative analysis: artificial intelligence and statistical inference,"This thesis consists of four essays exploring quantitative methods for investment analysis. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the topic where the backgrounds, motivations and contributions of the thesis are discussed. This Chapter proposes an expert system paradigm which accommodates the methodology for all four empirical studies presented in Chapters 2 to 5. 
In Chapter 2 the profitability of technical analysis and Bayesian Statistics in trading the EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY exchange rates are examined. For this purpose, seven thousand eight hundred forty-six technical rules are generated, and their profitability is assessed through a novel data snooping procedure. Then, the most promising rules are combined with a Naive Bayes (NB), a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA), a Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) and a Bayesian regularised Neural Network (BNN) model. The findings show that technical analysis has value in Foreign eXchange (FX) trading, but the profit margins are small. On the other hand, Bayesian Statistics seems to increase the profitability of technical rules up to four times. 
Chapter 3 introduces the concept of Conditional Fuzzy (CF) inference. The proposed approach is able to deduct Fuzzy Rules (FRs) conditional to a set of restrictions. This conditional rule selection discards weak rules and the generated forecasts are based only on the most powerful ones. In order to achieve this, an RVM is used to extract the most relevant subset of predictors as the CF inputs. Through this process, it is capable of achieving higher forecasting performance and improving the interpretability of the underlying system. The CF concept is applied in a betting application on football games of three main European championships. CFâ€™s performance in terms of accuracy and profitability over the In-Sample (IS) and Out-Of-Sample (OOS) are benchmarked against the single RVM and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) fed with the same CF inputs and an Ordered Probit (OP) fed with the full set of predictors. The results demonstrate that the CF is providing higher statistical accuracy than its benchmarks, while it is offering substantial profits in the designed betting simulation. 
Chapter 4 proposes the Discrete False Discovery Rate (DFDR+/-) as an approach to compare a large number of hypotheses at the same time. The presented method limits the probability of having lucky findings and accounts for the dependence between candidate models. The performance of this approach is assessed by backtesting the predictive power of technical analysis in stock markets. A pool of twenty-one thousand technical rules is tested for a positive Sharpe ratio. The surviving technical rules are used to construct dynamic portfolios. Twelve categorical and country-specific Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes are examined over ten years (2006-2015). There are three main findings. First, the proposed method has high power in detecting the profitable trading strategies and the time-related anomalies across the chosen financial markets. Second, the emerging and frontier markets are more profitable than the developed markets despite having higher transaction costs. Finally, for a successful portfolio management, it is vital to rebalance the portfolios on a monthly basis or more frequently. 
Chapter 5 undertakes an extensive investigation of volatility models for six securities in FX, stock index and commodity markets, using daily one-step-ahead forecasts over five years. A discrete false discovery controlling procedure is employed to study one thousand five hundred and twelve volatility models from twenty classes of Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Stochastic Volatility (SV), and Heterogeneous AutoRegressive (HAR) families. The results indicate significant differences in forecasting conditional variance. The most accurate models vary across the three market categories and depend on the study period and measurement scale. Time-varying means, Integrated GARCH (IGARCH) and SV, as well as fat-tailed innovation distributions are the dominant specifications for the outperforming models compared to three benchmarks of ARCH (1), GARCH (1,1), and the volatility poolâ€™s 90th percentile. 
Finally, Chapter 6 puts together the main findings from the four essays and presents the concluding marks.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Arman Hassanniakalager"", ids = ""23133108"")",,31587d5afc9c82ade0698d4b36104ac746c6fbaa;

afba9e9c51a249b045a707c254b30fd3e99d98b5,On reliable discovery of molecular signatures,"BackgroundMolecular signatures are sets of genes, proteins, genetic variants or other variables that can be used as markers for a particular phenotype. Reliable signature discovery methods could yield valuable insight into cell biology and mechanisms of human disease. However, it is currently not clear how to control error rates such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in signature discovery. Moreover, signatures for cancer gene expression have been shown to be unstable, that is, difficult to replicate in independent studies, casting doubts on their reliability.ResultsWe demonstrate that with modern prediction methods, signatures that yield accurate predictions may still have a high FDR. Further, we show that even signatures with low FDR may fail to replicate in independent studies due to limited statistical power. Thus, neither stability nor predictive accuracy are relevant when FDR control is the primary goal. We therefore develop a general statistical hypothesis testing framework that for the first time provides FDR control for signature discovery. Our method is demonstrated to be correct in simulation studies. When applied to five cancer data sets, the method was able to discover molecular signatures with 5% FDR in three cases, while two data sets yielded no significant findings.ConclusionOur approach enables reliable discovery of molecular signatures from genome-wide data with current sample sizes. The statistical framework developed herein is potentially applicable to a wide range of prediction problems in bioinformatics.",2008,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Roland Nilsson"", ids = ""1681221""); list(name = ""Johan L.

5b330edfb6c3e02225cc65db0ea84bbea556d11f,Genome-wide DNA methylation and long-term ambient air pollution exposure in Korean adults,"BackgroundAmbient air pollution is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood; epigenetic effects including altered DNA methylation could play a role. To evaluate associations of long-term air pollution exposure with DNA methylation in blood, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study in a Korean chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰100 including 60 cases) using Illuminaâ€™s Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip. Annual average concentrations of particulate matter â‰¤â€‰10Â Î¼m in diameter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were estimated at participantsâ€™ residential addresses using exposure prediction models. We used robust linear regression to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and two different approaches, DMRcate and comb-p, to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs).ResultsAfter multiple testing correction (false discovery rate <â€‰0.05), there were 12 DMPs and 27 DMRs associated with PM10 and 45 DMPs and 57 DMRs related to NO2. DMP cg06992688 (OTUB2) and several DMRs were associated with both exposures. Eleven DMPs in relation to NO2 confirmed previous findings in Europeans; the remainder were novel. Methylation levels of 39 DMPs were associated with expression levels of nearby genes in a separate dataset of 3075 individuals. Enriched networks were related to outcomes associated with air pollution including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as inflammatory and immune responses.ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that long-term ambient air pollution exposure impacts DNA methylation. The differential methylation signals can serve as potential air pollution biomarkers. These results may help better understand the influences of ambient air pollution on human health.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mi Kyeong Lee"", ids = ""6282826""); list(name = ""Cheng-Jian Xu"", ids = ""2673463""); list(name = ""Megan Ulmer Carnes"", ids = ""7022630""); list(name = ""Cody E.

Current research focused on therapeutic interventions aimed at molecular amelioration, but there are no reliable noninvasive signatures available to understand disease pathogenesis. The present study investigates the alterations of plasma cellâ€free microRNAs (miRNAs) in FRDA patients and attempts to find the significance in relevance with the pathogenesis. Total RNA from the plasma of patients and healthy controls were subjected to miRNA microarray analysis using Agilent Technologies microarray platform. Differentially regulated miRNAs were validated by SYBRâ€green realâ€time polymerase chain reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The study identified 20 deregulated miRNAs (false discovery rate < 0.01, fold change â‰¥ 2.0 â‰¤) in comparison with healthy controls; out of which 17 miRNAs were upregulated, and 3 miRNAs were downregulated. Target and pathway analysis of these miRNAs have shown association with neurodegenerative and other clinical features in FRDA. Further validation (n = 21) identified a set of significant (p < 0.05) deregulated miRNAs; hsaâ€miRâ€15aâ€5p, hsaâ€miRâ€26aâ€5p, hsaâ€miRâ€29aâ€3p, hsaâ€miRâ€223â€3p, hsaâ€24â€3p, and hsaâ€miRâ€21â€5p in comparison with healthy controls.

11fc39628c2cb6a12c4000d5807ef8c5eb15003f,Plasma MicroRNA Profiles in Patients with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Responding to Adalimumab plus Methotrexate vs Methotrexate Alone: A Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim was to identify plasma (i.e., cell-free) microRNA (miRNA) predicting antitumor necrosis and/or methotrexate (MTX) treatment response in patients enrolled in an investigator-initiated, prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (The OPERA study, NCT00660647).


METHODS
We included 180 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naive patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) randomized to adalimumab (ADA; n = 89) or placebo (n = 91) in combination with MTX. Plasma samples before and 3 months after treatment initiation were analyzed for 91 specific miRNA by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on microfluidic dynamic arrays. A linear mixed-effects model was used to test for associations between pretreatment miRNA and changes in miRNA expression and American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Boolean (28 joints) remission at 3 and 12 months, applying false discovery rate correction for multiple testing. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we built predictive multivariate miRNA models and estimated classification performances using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves.


RESULTS
In the ADA group, a higher pretreatment level of miR-27a-3p was significantly associated with remission at 12 months. The level decreased in remitting patients between pretreatment and 3 months, and increased in nonremitting patients. No associations were found in the placebo group receiving only MTX. Two multivariate miRNA models were able to predict response to ADA treatment after 3 and 12 months, with 63% and 82% area under the ROC curves, respectively.


CONCLUSION
We identified miR-27a-3p as a potential predictive biomarker of ACR/EULAR remission in patients with early RA treated with ADA in combination with MTX. We conclude that pretreatment plasma-miRNA profiles may be of predictive value, but the results need confirmation in independent cohorts.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""J Sode"", ids = ""144004671""); list(name = ""Sophine B.

1fbf1d235156eaf014deebaa88d8b2feba5b4d2e,FDR control with pseudo-gatekeeping based on a possibly data driven order of the hypotheses.,"We propose a multiple testing procedure controlling the false discovery rate. The procedure is based on a possibly data driven ordering of the hypotheses, which are tested at the uncorrected level q until a suitable number is not rejected. When the order is data driven, larger effect sizes are considered first, therefore selecting more interesting hypotheses with larger probability. The proposed procedure is valid under independence for the test statistics. We also propose a modification which makes our procedure valid under arbitrary dependence. It is shown in simulation that we compare particularly well when the sample size is small. We conclude with an application to identification of molecular signatures of intracranial ependymoma.

8de443e8d88863788b96bbd9abafb847ea2d1ff3,Serum Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 in Parkinson's Disease; Study of Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers and White Matter Microstructure,"Background: Growing evidence shows that impaired signaling of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is still controversy regarding its proinflammatory or neuroprotective function. In an attempt to elucidate the contribution of IGF-1 in PD, we aimed to discover the relation between serum IGF-1 levels in drug-naÃ¯ve early PD patients and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as well as microstructural changes in brain white matter. Methods: The association between quartiles of serum IGF-1 levels and CSF biomarkers (Î±-synuclein, dopamine, amyloid-Î²1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau) was investigated using adjusted regression models in 404 drug-naÃ¯ve early PD patients with only mild motor manifestations and 188 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) enrolled in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). By using region of interest analysis and connectometry approach, we tracked the white matter microstructural integrity and diffusivity patterns in a subgroup of study participants with available diffusion MRI data to investigate the association between subcomponents of neural pathways with serum IGF-1 levels. Results: PD patients had higher levels of IGF-1 compared to HC, although not statistically significant (mean difference: 3.60, P = 0.44). However, after adjustment for possible confounders and correction for False Discovery Rate (FDR), IGF-1 was negatively correlated with CSF Î±-synuclein, total and phosphorylated tau levels only in PD subjects. The imaging analysis proved a significant negative correlation (FDR corrected P-value = 0.013) between continuous levels of serum IGF-1 in patients with PD and the connectivity, but not integrity, in following fibers while controlling for age, sex, body mass index, depressive symptoms, education years, cognitive status and disease duration: middle cerebellar peduncle, cingulum, genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. No significant association was found between brain white matter microstructral measures or CSF markers of healthy controls and levels of IGF-1. Conclusion: Altered connectivity in specific white matter structures, mainly involved in cognitive and motor deterioration, in association with higher serum IGF-1 levels might propose IGF-1 as a potential associate of worse outcome in response to higher burden of Î±-synucleinopathy and tauopathy in PD.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Farzaneh Ghazi Sherbaf"", ids = ""133954986""); list(name = ""Bahram Mohajer"", ids = ""39715170""); list(name = ""Amir Ashraf-Ganjouei"", ids = ""1401596299""); list(name = ""Mahtab Mojtahed Zadeh"", ids = ""134437233""); list(name = ""Ali Javinani"", ids = ""13305736""); list(name = ""Hossein Sanjari Moghaddam"", ids = ""134078085""); list(name = ""Mehdi Shirin Shandiz"", ids = ""52161256""); list(name = ""Mohammad Hadi Aarabi"", ids = ""2226440"")",d5b493619caa1a5a56323d89ee8a823b5c9ac80f; cdb43292949190886d6d500b066df8181fb44a2e,be9c1248e636da000e14d95a1fce664a604cf308; 297c113b8d37ea6c9e966c69597efa21a57b8886; e94883bc9f522205509092961efa12656cdcbf3a; 22b9b2693e77c50879d30ad77455a02b93ec162f; 7cf70149670765e2f7dbfba792fda7b34029ba54; b03ce9931f40ad5c844be481bc4e01333e18a336; 8f113e068e98cc42f3686bf258f2900aa2b41ef0; fc4e03405e039aed691bd4056a9de2f23ed7b3bd; 425eeef9201ef7c547b40bdfd71c794dec0be25c; 1206baade0a7cecb1894b7cf0f2f13bbf0f1b4d5; 9f879042667f014aedc09618aa9cae3e489813f9; 10dc1e972001f791509041ee1e6dc125f61d46d4; f0c6dac575673fe01f23ea922caba6bc17c3565a; 1ad3e8561ab2c7b58cb041714e91ace367e9e9ec; c64acaac98508d1f32dfa763601897d3bec76faa; bb1e4e6f53e251f56fad59f2f59d8a73b4f56bdb; 88a4baabf18f5f84fb0aceb82b7a7191c37af261; 88bb5b962b2c826bcd938226861edbc60abb2c5f; 4b72ce3f5a6daef6ce2674be4f83af19b56b4441; f92f4418d4a4523a5760414144ecce8ab6472fde; dc7256287939144c79fa028cae3b137a2876078f; 5ffd251edbd188a6eca34eff80c421390677f578; bdc773282c7f7cd331324d1c91bc38300947f8d8; 030356472e86ad8f8a99f7e0c15d43a1f469ec0a; 5e86dc9ca893723d54ab5256b38eb5940c53b688; a5e35ac5cb348f86ca57bf1e861de50246c00974; 6cc860c912d0ec64be753b4dd3713e3d5cc6af75; 3a6ccd275cff0ffb1c23de8710ff603e1ddbdd59; edbc54d4ac6532f7b773b2929a6258301340349d; f706650c04e8eb9675b97d37661a2ceb71c04a40; a3c594e382982d7e077d69f680cfa785ee1c1403; d80e6b42b3299d1556e206464919ea30d2cabfa9; dfbcca7c6c802c149973d7ab73ec5f36bc8de4f8; 395be65b8340533ab0a254aab5394f6c7a962a55; 0112711b4b069179a0d5877b890ff2b8145e7226; a58e261a3ea15d543e94936422dc93b9c2feeb97; ce1e9e37a19eab826deefbfef7b604f1f43de4f2; bdcb3da461671bcb42dc80ebb5ff1897316fb324; 1b544bfd361b551b8e3362de058446f9f66d3a1b; bc458c5b62a357a2b1d78ca9cb3e97aea07d5d55; dab645ec4b17b1b2bec8fdeb91786fec3be8f1c5; 945738698eb4020e28bdcaf21cc7e1e057dfb06d; 0ad7c9ae86d5fc4d8fbd3a17483de80bee2898fc; 1767e5e90f7c9c07ff371063b739fd66a9404d02; 35690500afc4f746f6f5099563125ee387e7824c; ea3dc8283318169b9aba3f7ada4390892e665b91; a6f02baf1030c3327070db84eaefc68b8abb4251; 89061a3a2c0be2b589df22713d6a32324f23829e; b0748a6290f474991ed8010533284b6c1c85fb95; af4091421d47640a512c9fe8ca3a1986e5f6b4d1; 45ca05547e9d97697464fca5c109286c655ec2f2; a261bef8b0c3fa2e222592e612736b2e25562f91; b1b89da352d5ff039eaad7cb046421a3125f9dd3; f4f2c22109a079221fcae0fe3ef54f7535cb3a62; 6366fa3b2c74b756766384699989fdc0eafdf8d1; 56364c98cbb01a521bd655318dd9e3b287213650; 41e8b863438fcd3ef827205f72f28d169c2c5dfb; 1af60f3c2f5acb27e62ffff9a7853c7b0bee89e6; 8bc4ac4d541b811cc778486fd0afc34ceab37456; b2f1333b9a5c7dd10f6245bb6c231d552e04abee; 8a0d2b7b37ad116ddb5ec6437a47edac89cc63a4; b7ff091064be6b2c655167f23f5013cb39a3c2fa; 68f63ff6a9ac3b117fa3d08fad4a124ec9d61333; 007244983dc55c38db907d45749b76c98d2a14fe; 6fcf71686db7319541008b91ea3a1fa1b51f4853; 46cbb2126c91630d3736de5d74b4aa26e87b9f42; e5a7f341c9e3ead7486c83b14585a57ec3c12d26; 013065c419a9a9692113c51607b37b0439a8a33a; eda6c4946164a47aea9c6448f7b275afff92996a; 3475c45939c139f1551bbc79242914d3fe309ad2; 9091d3ca065fb9c072200fdfcd83dee3fe42301f; 23d97834620ecd25dd8857a569073877e4074936; 0e4c38f97b70723e9ffdfe0e835e4de56ee04210; 349892c09ddc0c2ac3a072da25e0f138db8fac32; ba8b62b51d03f2290f827d614f85a1526b2d6975; bde7950af0af8db98dc3cbf15dc26e220d6eb4a4; 84e6fd36c980a0bcec13b6f986cb984094b6b47e,Frontiers in Endocrinology,9,
d7b47cb03cfde0646dd761221ceb38cc77c45a86,Treatment of Vitamin D Insufficiency in Postmenopausal Women: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE
Experts debate optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels for musculoskeletal health.


OBJECTIVE
To compare the effects of placebo, low-dose cholecalciferol, and high-dose cholecalciferol on 1-year changes in total fractional calcium absorption, bone mineral density, Timed Up and Go and five sit-to-stand tests, and muscle mass in postmenopausal women with vitamin D insufficiency.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at a single center in Madison, Wisconsin, from May 1, 2010, through July 31, 2013, and the final visit was completed on August 8, 2014. A total of 230 postmenopausal women 75 years or younger with baseline 25(OH)D levels of 14 through 27 ng/mL and no osteoporosis were studied.


INTERVENTIONS
Three arms included daily white and twice monthly yellow placebo (n=76), daily 800 IU vitamin D3 and twice monthly yellow placebo (n=75), and daily white placebo and twice monthly 50,000 IU vitamin D3 (n=79). The high-dose vitamin D regimen achieved and maintained 25(OH)D levelsâ‰¥30 ng/mL.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Outcome measures were 1-year change in total fractional calcium absorption using 2 stable isotopes, bone mineral density and muscle mass using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, Timed Up and Go and five sit-to-stand tests, functional status (Health Assessment Questionnaire), and physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly), with Benjamini-Hochberg correction of P values to control for the false discovery rate.


RESULTS
After baseline absorption was controlled for, calcium absorption increased 1% (10 mg/d) in the high-dose arm but decreased 2% in the low-dose arm (Pâ€‰=â€‰.005 vs high-dose arm) and 1.3% in the placebo arm (Pâ€‰=â€‰.03 vs high-dose arm). We found no between-arm changes in spine, mean total-hip, mean femoral neck, or total-body bone mineral density, trabecular bone score, muscle mass, and Timed Up and Go or five sit-to-stand test scores. Likewise, we found no between-arm differences for numbers of falls, number of fallers, physical activity, or functional status.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
High-dose cholecalciferol therapy increased calcium absorption, but the effect was small and did not translate into beneficial effects on bone mineral density, muscle function, muscle mass, or falls. We found no data to support experts' recommendations to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or higher in postmenopausal women. Instead, we found that low- and high-dose cholecalciferol were equivalent to placebo in their effects on bone and muscle outcomes in this cohort of postmenopausal women with 25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL.

0ef43f2f30d1ae589d759f7c068d6f9382e742af,Local and covariate-modulated false discovery rates applied in neuroimaging,"False discovery rate (FDR) control has become a standard technique in neuroimaging. Recent work has shown that a finer grained estimate of the FDR is obtained by estimating, at a specific value of the test statistic, the scaled ratio of the null density to the observed density of the test statistic. The method can be extended by allowing an external covariate, also measured on the points where the hypothesis was tested, to modulate estimation of this local FDR. The current work, in addition to demonstrating these methods by re-analyzing results from two previously published investigations of cortical thickness, presents a method to test if the covariate modulation differs significantly from chance. The first study compared schizophrenia patients to healthy controls and the second compared genotypes of the -633 T/A polymorphism of the gene coding the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in a subset of the subjects from the case/control study. Local FDR estimates increased findings over FDR in both studies. Using p-values from the case/control study to modulate local FDR estimation in the BDNF study further increased findings. The relationship between case/control related and BDNF related cortical thickness variation was found to be highly significant, providing support for this gene's involvement in the etiology of the disease. The increased statistical precision from more accurate models of the distribution of the test statistic demonstrates the potential of these methods for neuroimaging and suggests the possibility to test novel hypothesis.",2009,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Glenn Lawyer"", ids = ""2747921""); list(name = ""Egil Ferkingstad"", ids = ""2715099""); list(name = ""Ragnar NesvÃ¥g"", ids = ""3214470""); list(name = ""Katarina VarnÃ¤s"", ids = ""1829562""); list(name = ""Ingrid Agartz"", ids = ""2775316"")",e72556b9cae6f99b0c2532deab7e3fb138c7900b; f3421365446452eae6531aba0b0b03e20a8cd2f5; b17a7cdf0db0d00ca8565bb6d58a756509b028cf; a1058e24d18384d7697d5472b706dd86bd5983b8; 4f84d52f6272acbcd0f4d9433c03e3e498818276,d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; f9084c9b61156a3ca6a5a6f8965a38bd7f0df980; d8c44b1cd38a27c78af9c9444d8be019e2f26417; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; b1885162d76e058e7573359078d76c93098b74f6; e82890bb6a0238533baf6ce85c73a0a1f4d40269; f89333bda0effd15dd0abc33933e923df907c1de; ce93ba95d614f983aa8e7492245b2a09fab5afb6; f9012f9c0fc9c44b759e42cda68d0a4b3af1f48d; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 09517e65cef3d8ae28bf4f6336bd437e5c65ee24; 055411f28a5e28c46c3f0079d397783afc721021; 1dbfa2053ddb473fcb1558eb2f0358381f277a28; d66c2e17a333ba87f63857980a506030dfb0a735; ee5a9fe60223343066469ef092e9b3e04c740c09; b34385fab890190a7937457061929718ef904b69; c8644971594953ba8ab6d0092fa906e0d96fb122; 3bd33278fbf267741659270f4adc00f730d9b703; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; a673eb7ef396bce790796e21036b214da01d133f; 83046784d552607d7399293127401ae5dfecd75e; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 46d4e1c9cf08266ab30eab35efd7cdfba7cb572f; 8fe66217f4b69b86f63b04be494f3828c8b27c9f; c42e914a16f163ba25d6333804454ef61195431a,NeuroImage,47,213-219
adcd992500a2eed3dc845299be4f2288f30ce2f8,Systematic identification of conserved motif modules in the human genome,"BackgroundThe identification of motif modules, groups of multiple motifs frequently occurring in DNA sequences, is one of the most important tasks necessary for annotating the human genome. Current approaches to identifying motif modules are often restricted to searches within promoter regions or rely on multiple genome alignments. However, the promoter regions only account for a limited number of locations where transcription factor binding sites can occur, and multiple genome alignments often cannot align binding sites with their true counterparts because of the short and degenerative nature of these transcription factor binding sites.ResultsTo identify motif modules systematically, we developed a computational method for the entire non-coding regions around human genes that does not rely upon the use of multiple genome alignments. First, we selected orthologous DNA blocks approximately 1-kilobase in length based on discontiguous sequence similarity. Next, we scanned the conserved segments in these blocks using known motifs in the TRANSFAC database. Finally, a frequent pattern mining technique was applied to identify motif modules within these blocks. In total, with a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.05, we predicted 3,161,839 motif modules, 90.8% of which are supported by various forms of functional evidence. Compared with experimental data from 14 ChIP-seq experiments, on average, our methods predicted 69.6% of the ChIP-seq peaks with TFBSs of multiple TFs. Our findings also show that many motif modules have distance preference and order preference among the motifs, which further supports the functionality of these predictions.ConclusionsOur work provides a large-scale prediction of motif modules in mammals, which will facilitate the understanding of gene regulation in a systematic way.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohui Cai"", ids = ""50320985""); list(name = ""Lin Hou"", ids = ""145669008""); list(name = ""Naifang Su"", ids = ""34563537""); list(name = ""Haiyan Hu"", ids = ""145431913""); list(name = ""Minghua Deng"", ids = ""1709706""); list(name = ""Xiaoman Li"", ids = ""50080279"")",f95a7971ab455fe78da5b48a6ad5b98d8066da36; 6ee5224987dc0b053d4497f21548687660b7f066; b068c9f2b9ed67b8b660f29316f98ac1ee86853b; 96110b5a518c7ae8acbf879033169d3d6f66b6d0; b543b9b813f02b774f4ddf23de19ead3fefeedc5; 5873693ceefc68dd3ae894731957dd2d640124f3; bb43503d4d65a47d973aa161fa81a768a8a452e9; 05547de23ce5b3c3fdf88bacadea40eca18e4939; 6b1919eabe8a8b9c04d32368cb28f013aaa05ef2; 5fadeab33052529cfc194801ec4563eaebd8b983; adcd992500a2eed3dc845299be4f2288f30ce2f8; 5d7c8d2c75176c3af47d6cec9f54e34321e4b5a9; e6132428467fd9c74b992355be666c96337f5550; 0b0b07cc81774c4bda184b23daad5b2e946c6893; e10882c70769b95555c12a2c1f1dac755e74f583; 0d8de7a6faddfe6f39e7e4ac9ba824539c63f483; c16e30238433deb072fe50de8bdb6ead2b4ebaa1; efd44e96a22398f7e0bb1993f9677584ea2a6864; c8b29b00371bddb461b10a08294455f0834bd727; f9634ec27b4b845ab7e6b503faf29afb2da9e044,be4976826d58f5bb67ff1f3ffb3224a61baa799a; 171d3627a839cbfefe0e361225bd4c5a691e79ff; a0c989cd0d00dbe6c949e0d87111ce27dda94316; 97e1e435999798f2088fcb728cabd0d76525bf85; 3542cdfe6a3b2b872317c2c4609bac0250238d00; 2b77ea2195696f301931d6802870fbb59f3c9f8e; 8aa32bc9e141002230acdde8c23883ace2ef61c5; b5864880222527c62a580d3a5c0ff5e9b2f2e85b; 58ed3464da1995fc96e788749ecaec4688765a1b; 82af8908421ee4d13792501b9c996f738cddd90b; c26605564b36b5ccaec3cb971deef79cc09d6c56; 4096614a735599901c89daea71b6c430a78c89c6; 1ed9514d9df57ccec3ed140f7655cc3ba06ea2ab; bfb71182ca30d8385fd1473759e6df230077fcee; c403d5ea5094e9f66f4184fdf7291c0239f3e0ac; d3d54bdb47fb1ea0b1f3d1097a2cfb04ecfdcc25; 9a49c75f6918c643699c568e5cc2326158bbafd6; 667d726dc1516fddab95e841cd0290e184942278; 208abacb96069c2384284252871b5e051a28af29; 420a812219b4b15d28a115b65e41914b3caa53fd; cd7763d7c118bc875ea34b30b52d0d95257b1418; 7f16cec1174f0e4d376acc9f72e0053c82f95950; 546525abf4315ae284f8c41037f84c19b4b8cf3d; 69602bc12d17d84fa1a9b146826545e6fd03b15e; 9c6bf5157ad2fb538089de9fc9c3c453025d4d17; 06088e91172728a03f62d9cd8352014356c10e47; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; ba8c61a0ef82c66911bb69a11d160735cc8e27d5; 778e0a4789266e31fd9bcc1397e23694f766a0f6; 453e5258a2f0949934d0e2838a6c2ca546f34457; ad7d1769779dde5fb6251db7656b7a6fcb3667b5; 731c807d2433ccfd8d09bf5472670413fdd6abaf; 2ababee3d0810c986c2db28e188d8e1b70e8e6ca; 0c469e044f597854d458c4bb21e4054859ce7d21; e72d2072e8ad7a1c70b7cee3bc12e629a3370c35; 4ad17bd0d314a22e774f6e56d0d539e7ec303e27; 3f2527c06cbbeea56ab49a84c3be7243a015505e; cfbfd5f15f8c1e8a6d63d024f9dbf00c4a91dfb6; 8ec3f279fec2f99ce5ced955dd630c865440bdec; 46c12f77484f45007c1ba559259c586993ec68d9; e8db5963bfee52b9796ff39d205bc4d7226b9bc5; 199711ed8895351595cba3420f1d055b2a83365c; 8ab3cb75edb599cb90f122ddd50cfaf3424ef75c; e73c52efa4fefe18bcbb2a594327d0dbbd17182e; c5d15702ed2bed2160e668ce5197c1005db8ca70; 79eefbeeb76bda387dbed3de32b41d69a7f859a4; adcd992500a2eed3dc845299be4f2288f30ce2f8,BMC Genomics,11,567 - 567
15c48d6f1075b10746f4b31f87e648bf66f19fc2,P5-20-05: Peripheral Blood Transcriptomics and Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity.,"Background: Doxorubicin (DOX) cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent and unpredictable. Currently, the clinical methods used for detection of pre-symptomatic DOX-induced cardiotoxicity show low diagnostic sensitivity and identify the existing cardiomyopathy rather than prevent it. It has been reported that DOX cardiomyopathy can occur at low doses, suggesting the presence of increased phenotypic sensitivity by some individuals. Studies have found specific gene expression signatures of circulating blood cells in response to physiological and pathological changes, suggesting that they can be used as biosensors for diagnostic purposes. This study aimed to characterize the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression profile associated with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity with an ultimate goal to identify biomarkers for early prediction of DOX cardiotoxicity. Materials and Methods. Twenty Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into 2 groups: DOX-treated (n=12) and controls (n=8). DOX-treated rats received a single intraperitoneal dose of 12 mg/kg DOX (similar to 65mg/m 2 for humans) and the controls were injected with saline. All rats were sacrificed 48 hours after DOX administration and blood, and samples from the heart left ventricle (LV) were collected. Histopathological alterations were evaluated microscopically. RNAs was isolated from cardiac LV and PBMCs. Cardiac and PBMC genome-wide expression profiling were performed using Illumina Rat Ref-12 BeadChip microarrays. For statistical analysis the raw data were log 2 transformed and median normalized. The differential analysis per gene was performed using a 2-sample (control vs. DOX-treated) Student9s t-test. Statistical significance was set at false discovery rate (FDR) Results. A total of 1406 transcripts were differentially expressed in the hearts (247 upregulated and 1159 downregulated) and 1526 in PBMCs (271 upregulated and 1255 downregulated) between DOX-treated rats and control rats. Of these 1237 genes (92%) were similarly differentially regulated (179 upregulated and 1058 downregulated) both in the hearts and PBMCs. Fifty metabolic/signaling pathways were significantly affected by DOX-treatment. The top ten of these include oxidative phosphorylation; cell proliferation and differentiation; TGF, WNT and cytoskeletal remodeling; insulin signaling; cell adhesion; regulation of amino acid metabolism, cytoskeleton remodeling, PI3K/AKt signaling and CCR5 signaling in macrophages and T lymphocytes. Discussion: The results from this study showed that PBMC gene expression profile reflected a similar pattern in the hearts of rats treated with DOX and provide a novel and important information about the feasibility of the PBMC as a surrogate marker for DOX cardiotoxicity. The data obtained lay a foundation for further clinical studies to identify the cardiotoxicity risk, predict DOX-treatment response and ultimately to allow the anti-cancer therapy to be tailored to individual patients.

To investigate the diffusion abnormalities in the brain of children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) with generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) by using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-one IGE children with GTCS and 16 controls were recruited. DKI was performed and maps of radial diffusivity (Î»âŠ¥ ), axial diffusivity (Î»// ), mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), radial kurtosis (KâŠ¥ ), axial kurtosis (K// ) and mean kurtosis (MK) were calculated. Voxel-based analyses were employed to compare diffusion metrics in epilepsy versus the controls.


RESULTS
In the case group, MD was found significantly higher in the right temporal lobe, the right occipital lobe, hippocampus, and some subcortical regions, while FA increased in bilateral supplementary motor area and the left superior frontal lobe (false discovery rate corrected Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Analysis of Î»âŠ¥ and Î»// showed that the increased MD was mainly due to the elevated Î»// . Significantly decreased MK was also detected in bilateral temporo-occipital regions, the right hippocampus, the left insula, the left post-central area, and some subcortical regions (false discovery rate corrected Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In most regions the changed MK were due to the decreased K// .


CONCLUSION
The kurtosis parameters (KâŠ¥ , K// , and MK) reflect different microstructural information in the IGE children with GTCS, and this support the value of DKI in studying children GTCS.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Junling Gao"", ids = ""46930284""); list(name = ""Shi-Ting Feng"", ids = ""144108215""); list(name = ""Bangxian Wu"", ids = ""25632521""); list(name = ""Nanjie Gong"", ids = ""6752623""); list(name = ""Minhua Lu"", ids = ""145463658""); list(name = ""Po-Man Wu"", ids = ""4122700""); list(name = ""He Wang"", ids = ""48016221""); list(name = ""Xiaoming He"", ids = ""1732829""); list(name = ""Bingsheng Huang"", ids = ""3261028"")",cf39971e73636ccaf82a0da494e5769cb1235607; 399b90d4c6bc3134ab176c52d197bb491bc935fe; 03508b1abba6405e8abb62da6f2ac19a5c941550; a1d84e8477b80c2a43b3224b1002fd4415fb12ab; 1198870cf4407ca4e65180445a67f4f41e102ad5; ee40a7dc2281c090dfefc5517268e115b9121626,,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,41 4,"

8671a7518c33c043c7956b7f12946cb99cab5b18,Efficiency of genome-wide association studies in random cross populations,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with plant species have employed inbred lines panels. We evaluated the efficiency of GWAS in non-inbred and inbred populations and assessed factors affecting GWAS. Fifty samples of 800 individuals from populations with linkage disequilibrium were simulated. Individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for traits controlled by ten quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 90 minor genes, assuming different degrees of dominance and broad sense heritabilities of 40 and 80%. The average SNP density was 0.1 centiMorgan (cM) and the QTL heritabilities ranged from 3.2 to 11.8%. The results for random cross populations evidenced that to increase the QTL detection power, the additive-dominance model must be fitted for traits controlled by dominance effects but must not be fitted for traits showing no dominance. The power of detection was maximized by increasing the sample size to 400 and the false discovery rate (FDR) to 5%. The average power of detection for the low, intermediate, and high heritability QTLs achieved 52.4, 87.0, and 100.0%, respectively. Assuming sample sizes of 400 and 800, the observed FDR was equal to or lower than the specified level of significance. The association mapping was highly precise, since at least 97% of the declared QTLs were detected by the SNP inside it (average bias of 0.4Â cM). Besides controlling the FDR, relatedness (and identity by state) efficiently controls the number of significant associations outside the QTL interval (not all false positive associations). The analysis of the inbred random cross population provided essentially the same results as the non-inbred populations.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""JosÃ© Marcelo Soriano Viana"", ids = ""36532774""); list(name = ""Gabriel Borges Mundim"", ids = ""4947038""); list(name = ""Helcio Duarte Pereira"", ids = ""30122773""); list(name = ""AndrÃ©a Carla Bastos Andrade"", ids = ""39990230""); list(name = ""Fabyano Fonseca Silva"", ids = ""2820472"")",71ba9baaad99673e0b645cf700c58b8c0f2a04f1; 4fc6e2c8890ddb78bd607229a191d9f5aac550f4,b4c69cf34916b2495c57e0d2e316edbcc11824ed; 1d85191f9a268bb7a3d6e00197fd8e50fb1e9870; e9921b543467fb9a0c678539a979b79c6ecd8858; 8f48fc887982fad851ecb486ef0d471f3e7f3a48; 1a6b223b5ee5ac78c81b562c857dddeca8dd171a; 604a87fa3099476cd1584b143350ee6980dd5a15; 2fe4d7deb937d1c126c8981ba3a4d42871ff5ac3; 0b52dd6c425e64ae7e82a05eeca5435385397e2a; 93042e3571fb7bf406c2782d450e69a5aba3eb7b; 92f2529251af27662252623b8ee0d2082d0e726a; 113d6586327b9a919779e73f609ac840634e1f66; 24d8e952a52591deb5f5e7fe68f38d22aeba6716; a9b588803315d93882007b894b53003563067408; 260ed7fbd2ecfb70c3875e05111b7eecdadb8ced; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c07c539d6b84b92a0aa8b7f4780a2b2566f00c76; 8ff34cfc1efd73fabadbd5e02e1be92beb27fd54; 5d8687679461a8957257ba52d5914e7e215b3971; 7360f21c799fbd12d9ee1edbd3cf5042d959c57a; 4b41ac7f9dc0eaeb582e0eca3c77e432cd80e4c9; 457d598b45010c6c689536ad661e4d7a089e8e2d; a2c4f79c710af13235c27d2621590cbbef8d9792; 11f595d30f22869054d2da81c6ce194087e19bf4; f1430cbf70841e9dee242c3be43a11d3ef31200b; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; be0f02677634e0b9acfd40ef1fead18932dfd6a2; 910f9a11a46b632e435762955288da23ba7370e0; 5d20af6d0a70bd3c20b829d684ce53105e2a1ce6; 75f481c52148432bad0fdd6f8082d1a0b5105531; 336861147c14c5218e6203494406cbf43dcd0e1d; 0b154ec416bcaf10ffd3456719c555e7fc99c8f5; 73aba37ca793ce9837e007e860c9da0a97360034; 0a417a5b09afa0eda0d037559b5ec8cee1d17e30; 9e44e2143d53f4f73c686b29432d669305c7a7ea,Molecular Breeding,37,1-13

We used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate shared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between blood lipids and immune-mediated diseases. We analyzed data fromGWAS (n~200,000 individuals), applying new False Discovery Rate (FDR) methods, to investigate genetic overlap between blood lipid levels [triglycerides (TG), low density lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL)] and a selection of archetypal immune-mediated diseases (Crohnâ€™s disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, psoriasis and sarcoidosis).

We discovered several shared risk loci between the immune-mediated diseases and TG (n = 88), LDL (n = 87) and HDL (n = 52). Three-way analyses differentiated the pattern of pleiotropy among the immune-mediated diseases. The new pleiotropic loci increased the number of functional gene network nodes representing blood lipid loci by 40%. Pathway analyses implicated several novel shared mechanisms for immune pathogenesis and lipid biology, including glycosphingolipid synthesis (e.g. FUT2) and intestinal host-microbe interactions (e.g. ATG16L1). We demonstrate a shared genetic basis for blood lipids and immune-mediated diseases independent of environmental factors.

d3b3c7a5f918230379b1c8b2472f12e3a53a827c,Identification of Aberrantly Expressed lncRNAs Involved in Orthodontic Force Using a Subpathway Strategy,"Background
The aim of the study was to identify key long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) and related subpathways in the periodontal ligament tissue following orthodontic force.


Methods
We adopt a novelty subpathway strategy to identify lncRNAs competitively regulated functions and the key competitive lncRNAs in periodontal ligament disorders after undergoing orthodontic force. To begin with, patients with orthodontics in our hospital were enrolled in our research. The relationship of lncRNA-mRNA was established through shared predicted miRNA by using the hypergeometric test, Jaccard coefficient standardization, and the Pearson coefficient to determine the valid interaction relationship. After embedding screened lncRNA interactions to pathways, the significant subpathways were recognized by lenient distance and Wallenius approximation methods to calculate the false discovery rate value of each subpathway.


Results
The lncRNA-mRNA intersections including 263 lncRNAs, 1,599 mRNAs, and 3,762 interacting pairs were obtained. The enriched mRNAs were further enriched into various candidate pathways such as the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Several subpathways were screened, including the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, 04510_1 focal adhesion, and p53 signaling pathway, respectively. The network of pathway-lncRNA-mRNA was constructed. Several key lncRNAs including DNAJC3-AS1, WDFY3-AS2, LINC00482, and DLEU2 were screened.


Conclusions
DNAJC3-AS1, WDFY3-AS2, LINC00482, and DLEU2 as aberrantly expressed lncRNAs involved in orthodontic force might play crucial roles in periodontal ligament disease pathogenesis.",2019,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xin-xing Guo"", ids = ""8395418""); list(name = ""Jian-ning Wang"", ids = ""77407233""); list(name = ""Jing Chen"", ids = ""47739833"")",,a27c1f17eea7167c3204da8ad0724ffb02a217b1; f1750e3fc8da674bef108e93fa3fb6b40b2e5cd4; b4bd6a091706539a65a97e1879e94e240d3b0d72; de408251f836704e2975221ae379a0a3572d868f; f0baeab8f32efb3af0b71cf1fef70b7d01256361; 082683768c7af525bcd806f7da8eeb8fd154e873; 81e4a565af41d647aef0932cbb5e1ab337456e84; 0c2669cc9a6bc30a53f857cfac1d17ea51dbd1da; 63bd3fdf3d53fd2208f11dea77d397f3247eeaf9; 23e90875a50052436635aee82d244a173b5f0a39; d6f541fa951b42befc4cd828bb38e26410ab8b12; d4001144d09ccb93dbb8d1d49bef039bc252b7f4; 1cb290a6d5e24e1d09391464c91f597155bfbe9d; 1d08d66c95265c8ae08623473a23a049ae8d3dd4; eb831ad42c4a4b31ce82bc8bd912a1a67f7b95cb; 6c887e18fc6e6f2c9a20687daed317d0438d279c; 4318a4400db454618a281008a4d753be223e3f36; 6efe1e15ec3c25818c7f32c174f73b2461731d80; b8d67673d080ee7585eae88f53fcaa31099308e1; 0bdd94f893fc1d57225307e3146d68dcd576f3bd; 790268f96bf946eb1e7b872d895153dabeea87b6; 6efafa78d68aa4cf7966da17b22b28fa3ada36ca; 1984c6e68957c2c4c44263f6f39c7a6e25167f7b; 166a6261a056ed46596bfc4e257e9f351ba2de45; 8beaa1add6e8940da3f1df43881cf2a84a27eecc; a4693db18fd2a3cfad82409ec65f952a039a9af4; ae5464348abe415e843eb7ad0b745c77f227f64b; 62dd4494f8d0dbee79a2b1b5c338b61d966b4385; 20db47bfa2a68fc7907dd6f29d532bba120cf2c4; 22b42776f13b230093143c4dfb8f7e25ca683391,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2019,

The underlying biologic mechanisms that drive CLAD are poorly understood. To address the pathogenesis of CLAD at the molecular level, we performed RNA-seq analysis of airway brush samples and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) multiplex cytokine and chemokine measurements in bronchial lavage (BAL) samples. Methods Total RNA was extracted from distal bronchial brush samples and sequenced using an Illumina instrument to obtain bulk RNA-seq data which were subsequently analyzed for differential gene expression (DGE) profiling with correction for a potential batch effect. Gene enrichment and gene and cell ontology analyses of DGE profile was done and used to predict canonical pathways and cellular upstream regular of activated signal pathways. False discovery rate (FDR) p Results 21 CLAD and 18 stable control LTRs were included for RNA-seq analysis. Corresponding MSD measurements were performed on 17 CLAD and 11 control BAL samples. 1031 DEGs were overrepresented in CLAD samples. Gene analyses revealed enrichment of the Type-1 adaptive immune response and the inflammasome. TNF- Î± (p Conclusion Transcriptome analyses and the lung allograft BAL immune proteome, provide novel insights into the immune activation pathways prevalent in CLAD versus controls. Further analyses may provide the rationale for testing select immune targets in CLAD and uncover distinct immune endotypes within CLAD.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Carlo J.

9ec7f3dc3858c59b78eb1d22566604ef0d40052e,Network biology approach for identifying key regulatory genes by expression based study of breast cancer,"The use of high-throughput array technology is omnipresent in diverse areas specifically, early diagnosis of disease, discovery of infectious agents, search for biological markers and screening of potential drug candidates. Here, we integrated gene expression data with the network-based approach to identify novel genes that were playing central role in the network through interconnecting to a number of differentially expressed breast cancer genes. The 62 cancerous genes retrieved from the Breast Cancer Gene Database (BCGD) were mapped in the normalized data accessed from Stanford Microarray Database (SMD) to analyze their pattern. Interaction networks for each gene were constructed to understand the biology of the metastasis at systems level. The individual networks were fused together for the detection of interacting hubs, 38 novel genes were found to be deeply intermingled with the central hub node. Gene Ontology studies were made to depict the biology of the hub nodes not alone through gene ranking but by applying the Hyper geometric test with the Benjamini Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction method at a significance level of 0.05. Analyzing p-values from the statistical test indicated that most of the novel genes were involved in the same biological function as the disordered genes like signal transducer, transcription regulator, enzyme binding, molecular transducer and receptor signaling protein activity and same pathway as MAPK signaling, Apoptosis, Wnt Signaling, ErbB signaling and Cell Cycle. Lastly, we identified 3 novel genes CHUK, INSR and CREBBP showing high connections with the 12 novel genes reported in literatures as well with the perturbed genes. As a result, these genes can be considered as significant finding in revealing the basis and pathways responsible for breast cancer.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yamini Chand"", ids = ""2216339""); list(name = ""Md.

47c791dd192ecfc73d88a6ff70687d3b554816f7,Lateral semi-circular canal asymmetry in females with idiopathic scoliosis.,"PURPOSE
Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spinal structural deformity that occurs in otherwise normal individuals. Although curve progression and severity vary amongst individuals, AIS can lead to significant cosmetic and functional deformity. AIS etiology has been determined to be genetic, however, exact genetic and biological processes underlying this disorder remain unknown. Vestibular structure and function have potentially been related to the etiopathogenesis of AIS. Here, we aimed to characterize the anatomy of the semicircular canals (SCC) within the vestibular system through a novel approach utilizing T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI).


METHODS
Three dimensional, MRI-based models of the SCCs were generated from AIS subjects (n = 20) and healthy control subjects (n = 19). Linear mixed models were used to compare SCC morphological measurements in the two groups. We compared side-to-side differences in the SCC measurements between groups (group*side interaction).


RESULTS
Side-to-side differences in the lateral SCC were different between the two groups [false discovery rate adjusted p-value: 0.0107]. Orientation of right versus left lateral SCC was significantly different in the AIS group compared to the control group [mean side-to-side difference: -4.1Â°, 95% CI: -6.4Â° to -1.7Â°]. Overall, among subjects in the AIS group, the left lateral SCC tended to be oriented in a more horizontal position than subjects in the control group.


SIGNIFICANCE
Asymmetry within the SCCs of the vestibular system of individuals with AIS potentially results in abnormal efferent activity to postural muscles. Consequences of this muscular activity during periods of rapid growth, which often coincides with AIS onset and progression, warrant consideration.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Patrick M Carry"", ids = ""35239494""); list(name = ""Victoria R Duke"", ids = ""143654177""); list(name = ""Christopher J Brazell"", ids = ""46257542""); list(name = ""Nicholas V Stence"", ids = ""4354725""); list(name = ""Melissa A.

Small gains in power achieved from using additional animals were dismissed, so that mice were not overproduced. The results of the analyses indicated that considerable power could be gained, for instance, by phenotyping control mice on the same days as mutants. To assess the between-center differences in capturing phenotype information, HrabÄ› de Angelis et al.1 examined data generated for the control strainâ€”C57BL/6Nâ€”at each center, as well as for 22 mutant lines common to at least two of the centers (Fig. 1). Significant intercenter variance was found in control strain data, due in large part to differences in measurement precision and scale, across centers. Further evaluation of this variance led to improvements in experimental procedures and in some cases to restricting data analyses to within-center comparisons. For the 22 mutant lines tested at more than one center, meta-analytical strategies revealed significant discordance in about 8% of comparisons, while demonstrating consistency for the majority of comparisons. High variation across centers in hit rates for each procedure was not surprising, given differences in criterion for selecting mutant lines among centers. Complex statistical analyses of the enormous amount of data generated at each center, including Bayesian vivariumâ€”an undertaking that presents an entirely new set of challenges. Accurately measuring the often subtle phenotypic changes that occur when specific genes are inactivated in mice is not trivial. These measurements must be standardized to ensure reproducibility over time within and between studies. Errors that occur during phenotype quantification can confound data interpretation, especially when they are larger than the effects of the genes being studied. The field responded to these challenges in 2008 with a resource of 150 standard operating procedures for assessing mouse phenotypes compiled by the European Mouse Phenotyping Resource of Standardised Screens (EMPReSS)3. The four participating centers in the study reported by HrabÄ› de Angelis et al.1 agreed to follow EMPReSS standardized testing protocols to maximize reproducibility and examined the broad phenotypic consequences of single-gene knockouts using 20 disease-based screens that capture information on 413 traits. Before experimentation, power analyses were carried out to evaluate detectable differences in effect sizes between knockout and control mice, based on attaining 80% power at a false discovery rate of 5%. These calculations were used to determine the optimal number of animals (seven males and seven females) A coordinated, global initiative to knock out every protein-coding gene in the mouse, one by one, is beginning to provide answers to fundamental questions about how genes function. A recent mouse phenotyping study reported in Nature Genetics by HrabÄ› de Angelis et al.1 from the European Mouse Disease Clinic (EUMODIC) consortium gives us a frontrow view of this effort. The authors present results from 20 broad-based physiologic screens completed for 320 of these knockout lines. By investigating the technical variation of results generated at different centers and developing a sophisticated statistical model that improves reproducibility across centers, they reveal new and surprising insights into mammalian genome function and uncover extensive pleiotropic effects. Disrupting gene function in animal model systems such as the mouse has been an important strategy for deciphering the roles of single genes in complex biological systems. However, despite enormous effort by many laboratories, we still know little or nothing about the roles of most genes. Part of the reason for this is that researchers have historically performed animal knockout experiments independently, based on their own expertise and interest in particular diseases. This means that opportunities for examining the broad functional consequences of knocking out individual genes have been limited, and that reproducibility of these studies has been low. More than a decade ago, amidst a worldwide surge of large-scale mouse mutagenesis studies, concerns arose that the enormous effort to make knockout mouse lines was often redundant, reflecting inefficient use of resources. This led to shared, coordinated strategies for making, using and archiving mouse mutant resources, with the ultimate goal of improving human health. In just over five years, the collaborative efforts of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium produced a public archive of mouse embryonic stem cell clones that represented mutations in almost all protein-coding genes in the mouse genome2. Although this was a major step forward, the EUMODIC partners recognized the critical need to move this collection from the freezer to the Scaling up phenotyping studies",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Karen L Svenson"", ids = ""6061390"")",,,Nature Biotechnology,33,1150-1151
10cb8957cd90d89f23e8250d790bc863f1f6b090,Germline variation in inflammation-related pathways and risk of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma,"Objective Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) incidence has risen sharply in Western countries over recent decades. Local and systemic inflammation is considered an important contributor to OA pathogenesis. Established risk factors for OA and its precursor, Barrett's oesophagus (BE), include symptomatic reflux, obesity and smoking. The role of inherited genetic susceptibility remains an area of active investigation. Here, we explore whether germline variation related to inflammatory processes influences susceptibility to BE/OA. Design We used data from a genomewide association study of 2515 OA cases, 3295 BE cases and 3207 controls. Our analysis included 7863 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 449 genes assigned to five pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX), cytokine signalling, oxidative stress, human leucocyte antigen and nuclear factor-&kgr;B. A principal components-based analytic framework was employed to evaluate pathway-level and gene-level associations with disease risk. Results We identified a significant signal for the COX pathway in relation to BE risk (p=0.0059, false discovery rate q=0.03), and in gene-level analyses found an association with microsomal glutathione-S-transferase 1 (MGST1); (p=0.0005, q=0.005). Assessment of 36 MGST1 SNPs identified 14 variants associated with elevated BE risk (q<0.05). Four of these were subsequently confirmed (p<5.5Ã—10âˆ’5) in a meta-analysis encompassing an independent set of 1851 BE cases and 3496 controls, and are known strong expression quantitative trait loci for MGST1. Three such variants were associated with similar elevations in OA risk. Conclusions This study provides the most comprehensive evaluation of inflammation-related germline variation in relation to risk of BE/OA and suggests that variants in MGST1 influence disease susceptibility.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew F.

To determine the transcriptional response to Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (SC) infection, a 13,297-oligonucleotide swine array was used to analyze RNA from control, 24-h postinoculation (hpi), and 48-hpi porcine lung tissue from pigs infected with SC. In total, 57 genes showed differential expression (p < 0.001; false discovery rate = 12%). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of 61 genes was used to confirm the microarray results and to identify pathways responding to infection. Of the 33 genes identified by microarray analysis as differentially expressed, 23 were confirmed by qRT-PCR results. A novel finding was that two transglutaminase family genes (TGM1 and TGM3) showed dramatic increases in expression postinoculation; combined with several other apoptotic genes, they indicated the induction of apoptotic pathways during SC infection. A predominant T helper 1-type immune response occurred during infection, with interferon Î³ (IFNG) significantly increased at 48 hpi. Genes induced by IFNs (GBP1, GBP2, C1S, C1R, MHC2TA, PSMB8, TAP1, TAP2) showed increased expression during porcine lung infection.

e52eceb7fcc6a9d8ac4c0e73fefe6c7455103188,Prolonged Application of High Fluid Shear to Chondrocytes Recapitulates Gene Expression Profiles Associated with Osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND
Excessive mechanical loading of articular cartilage producing hydrostatic stress, tensile strain and fluid flow leads to irreversible cartilage erosion and osteoarthritic (OA) disease. Since application of high fluid shear to chondrocytes recapitulates some of the earmarks of OA, we aimed to screen the gene expression profiles of shear-activated chondrocytes and assess potential similarities with OA chondrocytes.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Using a cDNA microarray technology, we screened the differentially-regulated genes in human T/C-28a2 chondrocytes subjected to high fluid shear (20 dyn/cm(2)) for 48 h and 72 h relative to static controls. Confirmation of the expression patterns of select genes was obtained by qRT-PCR. Using significance analysis of microarrays with a 5% false discovery rate, 71 and 60 non-redundant transcripts were identified to be â‰¥2-fold up-regulated and â‰¤0.6-fold down-regulated, respectively, in sheared chondrocytes. Published data sets indicate that 42 of these genes, which are related to extracellular matrix/degradation, cell proliferation/differentiation, inflammation and cell survival/death, are differentially-regulated in OA chondrocytes. In view of the pivotal role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the pathogenesis and/or progression of OA in vivo and regulation of shear-induced inflammation and apoptosis in vitro, we identified a collection of genes that are either up- or down-regulated by shear-induced COX-2. COX-2 and L-prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) induce reactive oxygen species production, and negatively regulate genes of the histone and cell cycle families, which may play a critical role in chondrocyte death.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
Prolonged application of high fluid shear stress to chondrocytes recapitulates gene expression profiles associated with osteoarthritis.

ec985a681eb720544c1e4c9ec6f6044e1459b90c,Gray matter atrophy distinguishes between Parkinson disease motor subtypes,"Objective:To assess differences in gray matter (GM) atrophy between 2 Parkinson disease (PD) subtypes: the tremor dominant (TD) subtype and the postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype. Methods:Patients were classified as belonging to the predominately PIGD (n = 30) or predominately TD (n = 29) subtype. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare GM in these 2 subtypes and to evaluate correlations between predefined regions of interest and the degree of symptoms. In the regions where GM atrophy was associated with symptoms, the relationship between GM volumes and functional connectivity was examined. Results:GM was reduced in the predominately PIGD group, compared with the predominately TD group, in areas that involve motor, cognitive, limbic, and associative functions (p < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Lower GM volumes in the preâ€“supplementary motor area (SMA) and in the primary motor area were associated with increased severity of PIGD symptoms (r = âˆ’0.42, p < 0.001; r = âˆ’0.38, p < 0.003, respectively). Higher GM volumes within the pre-SMA were associated with stronger functional connectivity between the pre-SMA and the putamen (r = 0.415, p < 0.025) in the patients with predominately PIGD. Conclusions:In patients with PD, PIGD symptoms are apparently associated with GM atrophy in motor-related regions and decreased functional connectivity. GM degeneration and a related decrease in spontaneous coactivation between cortical and subcortical motor-planning areas may partially account for the unique clinical characteristics of a subset of patients with PD.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Keren Rosenberg-Katz"", ids = ""1397388833""); list(name = ""Talia Herman"", ids = ""40448483""); list(name = ""Yael Jacob"", ids = ""1787769""); list(name = ""Nir Giladi"", ids = ""144701716""); list(name = ""Talma Hendler"", ids = ""1705259""); list(name = ""Jeffrey M.

b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930,On the consistency of adaptive multiple tests,"Much effort has been done to control the ""false discovery rate"" (FDR) when $m$ hypotheses are tested simultaneously. The FDR is the expectation of the ""false discovery proportion"" $\text{FDP}=V/R$ given by the ratio of the number of false rejections $V$ and all rejections $R$. In this paper, we have a closer look at the FDP for adaptive linear step-up multiple tests. These tests extend the well known Benjamini and Hochberg test by estimating the unknown amount $m_0$ of the true null hypotheses. We give exact finite sample formulas for higher moments of the FDP and, in particular, for its variance. Using these allows us a precise discussion about the consistency of adaptive step-up tests. We present sufficient and necessary conditions for consistency on the estimators $\widehat m_0$ and the underlying probability regime. We apply our results to convex combinations of generalized Storey type estimators with various tuning parameters and (possibly) data-driven weights. The corresponding step-up tests allow a flexible adaptation. Moreover, these tests control the FDR at finite sample size. We compare these tests to the classical Benjamini and Hochberg test and discuss the advantages of it.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Marc Ditzhaus"", ids = ""90676908""); list(name = ""Arnold Janssen"", ids = ""34626641"")",,add6e558d571b89faa49c3021c43094b9594e095; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; d60607f4c936a83d3823d1dd3b575370ff7fbe3c; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 0725893c81e1ea0131e27ffab61c31900f9bef05; cb9f6f5fae553d372dbcefecb2535b8caca9d0c5; 99cf8193a95d79aaa80925b613cc851e39e12788; eb1f52f4aed20a2292d5149a7e763094e8f38ed9; 8becaa4ddafe17458e0dd94fbd75d32a47d84d27; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; a1379882981e14a86d5a49925bb38dfd49f817c8; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 15ab26345d3c7accfa36c04d448e641628bfabbf; 85b3043be9fa0b7afe0e72694a23df8dfcbcb0a1; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 735cfe384afa5e090cb4cc70c1f56dd664ad6a64; e91ae2cef456516df3d9fc6997428500a1b8b5d3,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

It is assumed that the noise follows a Gaussian distribution and the signal follows a Gamma distribution, thus the underlying distribution of an observation will be a mixture of Gaussian and Gamma distributions. The parameters of the mixture model will be estimated from the EM algorithm. Then the signals and noises will be classified by a fixed threshold approach based on multiple testing using positive false discovery rate and Bayes error. The proposed method is applied to a real optical emission spectroscopy data for the quantitative analysis of inclusions.

We hypothesized that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression profiles could identify patients at risk of BOS. Methods and Materials Gene expression profiling was performed in PBMCs collected from 26 lung transplant recipients at 3 and 9 months after transplantation and prior to development of BOS.

094a35b3f915c57e1daf58dcad07866cedcd4537,Cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity correlate with severity of motor symptoms in Parkinsonâ€™s disease,"Background: Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is mainly characterized by movement dysfunction. Neurovascular unit (NVU) disruption has been proposed to be involved in the disease, but its role in PD neurodegenerative mechanisms is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) within the regions belonging to the motor network, in patients with mild to moderate stages of PD. Methods: Twenty-eight PD patients (66.6 Â± 8.6â€‰years, 22 males, median [interquartile range, IQR] Hoehn & Yahr = 1.5 [1â€“1.9]) and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were scanned with arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CBF assessment. ASL MRI was also acquired in hypercapnic conditions to induce vasodilation and subsequently allow for CVR measurement in a subgroup of 13 PD patients and 13 HCs. Median CBF and CVR were extracted from cortical and subcortical regions belonging to the motor network and compared between PD patients and HCs. In addition, the correlation between these parameters and the severity of PD motor symptoms [quantified with Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS III)] was assessed. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: No significant differences in terms of CBF and CVR were found between PD patients and HCs. Positive significant correlations were observed between CBF and UPDRS III within the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, striatum, pallidum, thalamus, red nucleus, and substantia nigra (pFDR < 0.05). Conversely, significant negative correlation between CVR and UPDRS III was found in the corpus striatum (pFDR < 0.05). Conclusion: CBF and CVR assessment provides information about NVU integrity in an indirect and noninvasive way. Our findings support the hypothesis of NVU involvement at the mild to moderate stages of PD, suggesting that CBF and CVR within the motor network might be used as either diagnostic or prognostic markers for PD.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Laura Pelizzari"", ids = ""4859604""); list(name = ""Maria Marcella LaganÃ "", ids = ""1968557""); list(name = ""Federica Rossetto"", ids = ""40198486""); list(name = ""Niels P Bergsland"", ids = ""2599672""); list(name = ""Mirco Galli"", ids = ""38623556""); list(name = ""Giuseppe Baselli"", ids = ""2912339""); list(name = ""Mario Clerici"", ids = ""145029087""); list(name = ""Raffaello Nemni"", ids = ""1722058""); list(name = ""Francesca Baglio"", ids = ""3090270"")",b9a00b34bfe5222605a131f26e01b332f96a67f9; 418fa637248c06d92f40cee281ccff68cfa81773,880ff9a2d1b63cc77e6fcf02a68a38ab8439bcc3; dc11cc032da829fc4276190dfa9939f35a667dc1; a741aaba9393c12443156de2fc514534d10751ea; 4030a013c282321224489f297d73ba9e972447ea; d295252063c96ecad04165a7471700a5fc55cf3f; 7a3a7e291b445f2394ee7520cb3640e128b2c979; b6a37231a24677991a4e169b0e61600232368989; fbe1445c656258ef0fa07da387bcac73904b7079; 557934d0e68f66f0770409f997a356d6dbad4848; 4c416834d25a513fac9ef774dcf6db7c0de5a872; 553aef5e1dc8618a68df7ad7924ca8cd9b38e5c0; 2c5e42e8128f2aa9036b3d12471ae636bdb00470; f2b643196d6b6add22d217927ba617795400a2c2; 4f5682af9826114242fbfde53d0d2b84a4fb0d30; c2d9bad5c81f1f5634cc7e8dbadea318a8630784; 9bde2cee3ad6dfc9b18d1dfc117f7e14d1c9ed9c; d05ce3b252fb3f39d38c1eefe71080e0a091e86c; 8c184f43bf5abacd82b4b5f2774f203896a03d86; d66f8691bc7732a47fd987953576acbee5d9e57c; 0c970cce32c5397f5a59ed3715ebfbe2b1050253; 42424d43d9f3bb065d444a91e723827cb4e9dd98; 4be7f3e8f8142247599eba69bacd9630bcb66a88; 8744b6ce4bdd9c364acd5bd51c62621dfeed23b9; 87228d03e55046c34fe3ae3c12148bda8d6c6cbf; 8fc36462b73ac34f788afcb41a1329ac20deb9bd; 2a6e11e7b1d207b4576062c1dea9ebc27af0db7a; 70f16762d5d73e32deb5c71d1e7aa2e2eb5e3d23; 77d0c8966b64e71f6edd94db24bc010740267176; b75b2ccfdf0bd01784e8bb1fc7acdcda2ade86f2; 4909ce0a472a4599c5fc56428e2d60d9f8a5a8c0; e57a53734509712b6f56931dedcbf82f0df33c72; 36419d2ca77bc58c9b193813d610231837096bb7; 4d92c092b2819e1ed90219e4dbb45c7fe3d87806; f1cb58b36aafe51d8156fb3fc81ef90f0002b91a; 744bfb00c1740c37dd7ec364afb7763aa6ed6c0c; 1306baef03ee0d24d880ccf7cab5a392c8e91523; dcec3bd123afabd49e36b149db24f082541a3fae; 8474cff94bdcc3ccbf08896d77b78fcde38231a2; a8d59663f1930a33145290ea62daf99d5b500acd; 85c0c25c447de1a91dd94f6bed6fdfb9d5b024fd; b8a690c7b3ff9c77cd966c45aef3c5fa5d4eeafd; eb1c60b01de5be0e7f1370130e6079256e9a857a; bdda7edc2306c571f22dbc0bbee8ddf2364ddcab,Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders,12,

We previously showed that high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces mouse Î²-cell proliferation in less than 1 wk in the absence of insulin resistance. Here we metabolically profiled tissues from a short-term HFD Î²-cell expansion mouse model to identify pathways and metabolite changes associated with Î²-cell proliferation. Mice fed HFD vs. chow diet (CD) showed a 14.3% increase in body weight after 7 days; Î²-cell proliferation increased 1.75-fold without insulin resistance. Plasma from 1-wk HFD-fed mice induced Î²-cell proliferation ex vivo. The plasma, as well as liver, skeletal muscle, and bone, were assessed by LC and GC mass-spectrometry for global metabolite changes. Of the 1,283 metabolites detected, 159 showed significant changes [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1]. The majority of changes were in liver and muscle. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed key metabolic changes in steroid synthesis and lipid metabolism, including free fatty acids and other bioactive lipids. Other important enrichments included changes in the citric acid cycle and 1-carbon metabolism pathways implicated in DNA methylation. Although the minority of changes were observed in bone and plasma (<20), increased p-cresol sulfate was increased >4 fold in plasma (the largest increase in all tissues), and pantothenate (vitamin B5) decreased >2-fold. The results suggest that HFD-mediated Î²-cell expansion is associated with complex, global metabolite changes.

c35eba8fd05ff209a681941f6e4a126629e1edb6,Can trophectoderm RNA analysis predict human blastocyst competency?,"A systematic review of the literature showed that trophectoderm biopsy could assist in the selection of healthy embryos for uterine transfer without affecting implantation rates. However, previous studies attempting to establish the relationship between trophectoderm gene expression profiles and implantation competency using either microarrays or RNA sequencing strategies, were not sufficiently optimized to handle the exceptionally low RNA inputs available from biopsied material. In this pilot study, we report that differential gene expression in human trophectoderm biopsies assayed by an ultra-sensitive next generation RNA sequencing strategy could predict blastocyst implantation competence. RNA expression profiles from isolated human trophectoderm cells were analysed with established clinical pregnancy being the primary endpoint. Following RNA sequencing, a total of 47 transcripts were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the trophectoderm cells from successfully implanted (competent) versus unsuccessful (incompetent) blastocysts. Of these, 36 transcripts were significantly down-regulated in the incompetent blastocysts, including Hydroxysteroid 17-Beta Dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) and Cytochrome P450 Family 11 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP11A1), while the remaining 11 transcripts were significantly up-regulated, including BCL2 Antagonist/Killer 1 (BAK1) and KH Domain Containing 1 Pseudogene 1 (KHDC1P1) of which the latter was always detected in the incompetent and absent in all competent blastocysts. Ontological analysis of differentially expressed RNAs revealed pathways involved in steroidogenic processes with high confidence. Novel differentially expressed transcripts were also noted by reference to a de novo sequence assembly. The selection of the blastocyst with the best potential to support full-term pregnancy following single embryo transfer could reduce the need for multiple treatment cycles and embryo transfers. The main limitation was the low sample size (NÂ =Â 8). Despite this shortcoming, the pilot suggests that trophectoderm biopsy could assist with the selection of healthy embryos for embryo transfer. A larger cohort of samples is needed to confirm these findings.

Cancer surgery may represent a potential risk of enhanced growth and metastatic ability of residual cancer cells due to post-operative immune dysfunction. This study identifies changes in transcription of genes involved in immune surveillance, immune suppression and carcinogenesis in the post-operative period of laparoscopic colon-cancer surgery within an ERAS regime.


METHODS
Patients undergoing elective, curatively intended laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer stage I-III UICC were included in the study. Patients followed standard of care in an ERAS setting. Whole blood gene expression profiling (WBGP) was performed on the day prior to surgery and 1, 2, 3 and 10-14 days after surgery. Samples were collected in Paxgene tubes and Labeled cDNA was fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChipâ„¢ 2.0. Results were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the false discovery rate. Pathway analysis was performed through the Molecular Signature Database. Paired fold changes of gene expression were calculated for post-operative compared to pre-operative samples. A mixed effect model was used to test differential gene expression by repeated-measures ANOVA.


RESULTS
WBGP of 33,804 genes at five timepoints in six patients showed 302 significantly differentially expressed genes between samples from the day prior to surgery and the day after surgery. Pathway gene enrichment analysis showed a downregulation of immunologically relevant pathways. There was a significant downregulation of genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling, antigen presentation and NK-cell activity after surgery. Furthermore, there was an upregulation of cytokines related to metastatic ability, growth and angiogenesis.

bec63b723711b0ce8438b9157cf44fa18b03b9db,A gradient-boosting approach for filtering de novo mutations in parent-offspring trios,"MOTIVATION
Whole-genome and -exome sequencing on parent-offspring trios is a powerful approach to identifying disease-associated genes by detecting de novo mutations in patients. Accurate detection of de novo mutations from sequencing data is a critical step in trio-based genetic studies. Existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield high error rates due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues, which may either miss true de novo mutations or call too many false ones, making downstream validation and analysis difficult. In particular, current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity, and developing effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious de novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge.


RESULTS
In this article, we curated 59 sequence features in whole genome and exome alignment context which are considered to be relevant to discriminating true de novo mutations from artifacts, and then employed a machine-learning approach to classify candidates as true or false de novo mutations. Specifically, we built a classifier, named De Novo Mutation Filter (DNMFilter), using gradient boosting as the classification algorithm. We built the training set using experimentally validated true and false de novo mutations as well as collected false de novo mutations from an in-house large-scale exome-sequencing project. We evaluated DNMFilter's theoretical performance and investigated relative importance of different sequence features on the classification accuracy. Finally, we applied DNMFilter on our in-house whole exome trios and one CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project and found that DNMFilter could be coupled with commonly used de novo mutation detection approaches as an effective filtering approach to significantly reduce false discovery rate without sacrificing sensitivity.

0f83b7e866afb02eac8bccb7a9171fa6b4148687,Abstract 07: The effect of genetic variants on the relationship between statins and breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.,"Background: Statins are the most widely prescribed and most effective cholesterol-lowering drugs used in the United States. Statins are a logical candidate for cancer chemoprevention in that they have multiple cellular effects other than lowering cholesterol, including: inhibition of rho GTPases, induction of apoptosis, and decreasing markers of chronic inflammation. A chemopreventive effect of statins on breast cancer has been suggested, however there is significant variation in inter-individual response to statins, and underlying genetic differences may modify the effect of statins on cancer risk. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate whether there is an interaction between genes modifying statin metabolism and statin use in relationship with breast cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS).

Methods: Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) data on 30,380 SNPS were available for 1,683 breast cancer cases and 1,683 one-to-one matched controls from the WHI and were included in Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS). Matching criteria were: age at screening, enrollment date, race/ethnicity (all were White), hysterectomy status at baseline and history of breast cancer at baseline. Statin use, sociodemographic information and potentially confounding variables were evaluated at baseline and breast cancer diagnoses were centrally adjudicated. We examined interactions between baseline statin use (yes or no) and 22 SNPs in or near 9 candidate lipid metabolism genes using a conditional logistic model adjusted for features at baseline associated with case/control status. We also examined interactions between statin use and all available SNPs from the GWAS after adjustment for significant features.

Results: There were two SNPs out of the 22 SNPs in or near the lipid genes of interest that were nominally significant; rs1529711 in the CARM1 gene [near candidate gene SMARC4 , minor allele frequency (MAF) 15%], Pint=0.04, and rs9282564 in the ABCB1 gene (MAF 10%), Pint=0.01. When all GWAS SNPs were examined for interactions with statin use, 34 SNPs achieved statistical significance using a 5% false discovery rate. The GWAS SNP with the greatest evidence for interaction with statin use on breast cancer risk was rs2875218 (Pint=0.0000076).

Conclusion: Two SNPs (rs1529711 and rs9282564) near candidate genes ( SMARC4 and ABCB1 , respectively) showed trends as effect modifiers of statins on breast cancer risk. SMARC4 is a SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, and was identified as a candidate effect modifier in a genome-wide study of statin induced myopathy (Link et al., NEJM , 2008). ABCB1 encodes a large transmembrane protein integral to the blood-brain barrier and functions as a drug-transport pump between brain and blood which attenuated LDL-C reduction in a study by Newman and Hulley ( JAMA 1996). From the genome-wide analyses, a SNP (rs2875218) located between PRDX3P3 and FREM2 on chromosome 13 was strongly implicated as interacting with statin use on breast cancer risk. Future analyses will examine tagSNPs covering genomic regions of interest including candidate genes and loci identified through this genome-wide examination of SNP x Statin interactions. We will also explore the associations by statin subtype (lipophilic, hydrophilic). Genetic associations such as these, if confirmed, may have implications in terms of personalized medicine, given that statin efficacy in relation to breast cancer risk may be increased or decreased in individuals dependent on inherited genetic polymorphisms.

Objective:

Glycomics is an emerging area for understanding carcinogenesis; studies in glycobiology have documented that aberrant glycosylation accompanies malignant transformation. We have used glycomic profiling of serum using nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and using biostatistics we report glycomics patterns distinguishing between non-small cell lung cancer cases (NSCLC) versus healthy controls.

Methods:

First, we obtained pre-operative sera of non-small lung cancer cases (Stages I-II) and healthy controls from the NYU biorepository. The serum sample set consisted of 50 lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) patients, 50 healthy controls and 28 COPD patients, matched on gender, smoking status, pack/year for smokers, and as best as possible for age. The samples are analyzed by extracting the N-glycans in sera and measuring the relative concentrations using nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS). Bioinformatic analysis was performed to identify glycans that are differentially present in patients with cancer compared to COPD and healthy controls using feature selection and classification algorithms. We further investigated whether a combination of multiple glycans (i.e. multiplex classifier) could improve predictive performance over individual glycans.

Results:

Of 330 glycans detected in the NYU serum set, twenty glycans were significantly differentiating (either over- or under-expressed) between cancer, COPD and controls at a false discovery rate < 0.05. Of these glycan features, 11 were different between cancer samples and control samples, while 14 glycans differed significantly between cancer samples and COPD samples. COPD samples differed significantly from Control samples for only one glycan in concentration, indicating large similarity in the glycosylation pattern between COPD and controls. Based on the glycomic profiles, cancer cases were well separated from both control and COPD samples, while COPD and control samples were not discriminated well from each other. These results indicate that glycan combinations might lead to improvements in the detection of non-small cell lung cancer.

Conclusions:

NSCLC cases were discriminated from controls and COPD using serum glycan profiles. These findings suggest that glycans that are differentially present in patients with NSCLC compared to normal controls or patients with other conditions have the great potential for a diagnostic test for non-small cell lung cancer. While these preliminary results are promising, extensive validation studies are necessary and in process.

a0a749af9dcbc0a455ee9aeef8ca90afbf46f85f,EpiChIP: gene-by-gene quantification of epigenetic modification levels,"The combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing technology (ChIP-seq) is a powerful and increasingly popular method for mapping protein-DNA interactions in a genome-wide fashion. The conventional way of analyzing this data is to identify sequencing peaks along the chromosomes that are significantly higher than the read background. For histone modifications and other epigenetic marks, it is often preferable to find a characteristic region of enrichment in sequencing reads relative to gene annotations. For instance, many histone modifications are typically enriched around transcription start sites. Calculating the optimal window that describes this enrichment allows one to quantify modification levels for each individual gene. Using data sets for the H3K9/14ac histone modification in Th cells and an accompanying IgG control, we present an analysis strategy that alternates between single gene and global data distribution levels and allows a clear distinction between experimental background and signal. Curve fitting permits false discovery rate-based classification of genes as modified versus unmodified.

b78865902bf510f7e3b6335ecc9abdcce585d2aa,123 Effect of heat stress on oocyte developmental competence and global gene expression dynamics in Bos taurus crossbred beef cows,"It is known that animals under the effect of heat stress present reduced fertility. We aimed to investigate the effect of heat stress on the developmental competence and global gene expression profile of oocytes through the transition from spring to summer under Louisiana conditions. Oocytes were collected from 6 crossbred, non-lactating cows once a month from May to July. Temperature and humidity indexes for May and July were 72.48 and 78.06, respectively. An index above 75 indicates that cows are under heat stress. All cows underwent dominant follicle removal, and then 7 days later, ovum pickup was performed to aspirate germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes. Half of the oocytes were processed for RNA-seq as GV, and half were matured in vitro to metaphase II (MII). Smart-seq protocol was followed to prepare RNA sequencing libraries from a pool of 4 oocytes (GV nâ€‰=â€‰6; MII nâ€‰=â€‰6). Sequencing reads were pre-filtered and aligned to the bovine genome, and gene expression values were calculated as transcripts per million. Genes were deemed differentially expressed between different conditions if they showed a false discovery rate P-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05 using DESEqn 2 package. DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) and IPA (ingenuity pathway analysis) were used to reveal the gene ontology and pathways, respectively. The RNA sequencing showed that a total of 212 genes were differentially expressed as a result of heat stress at the GV stage, with 94 and 118 genes up- and down-regulated, respectively. Gene ontology analysis indicated significant over-representation of elements involved in steroid biosynthetic process, oxidation reduction, and mitophagy in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Several pathways were influenced by heat stress, including glucocorticoid biosynthesis, apoptosis signalling, and HIPPO signalling. At the MII oocyte stage, only 93 genes (19 up-regulated and 74 down-regulated) were significantly differentially expressed in oocytes between July and May groups. Oocytes retrieved on different collection days, from the same cows under the same treatments, showed no difference on maturation rates, suggesting that the in vitro maturation process equalizes the expression of several genes. The primary biological processes significantly affected in MII oocytes were regulation of MAPK cascade, melanosome organisation, and negative regulation of transcription. In addition, we found that UBE2I, a gene involved in phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), was significantly up-regulated in July compared with May in MII oocytes. Interestingly, only 5 common genes were significantly affected by heat in both GV and MII oocytes: E2F8, GATAD2B, BHLHE41, FBXO44, and RAB39B. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of detrimental conditions (heat stress) on bovine oocytes, which may help to reveal master regulators controlling oocyte competence.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Zongliang Jiang"", ids = ""2265988""); list(name = ""FabiÃ¡n Alfredo Plazas DÃ­az"", ids = ""49261619""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

Westfallâ€","It was not such a long time ago that finding literature on multiplicity procedures was an arduous task. Despite there being several books on the subject, many of them, excellent in their own way, had one common drawback: They were out of date. Someone wishing to learn about the more recent methods in the field was forced to go on a scavenger hunt among the many statistical journals, and, after finding bits and pieces of the puzzle, attempt to put them together. It is thus with great pleasure that I saw not one, but two newly published books on multiplicity, the first written by Dmitrienko et al. (2009), a review of which was published in this journal (Lisovskaja and Burman, 2010). The second is Multiple Comparisons Using R by Bretz, Hothorn, and Westfall. Before plunging into the depths of detailed description, it should be stated that I found the book to be a rare gem; it is very seldom indeed that a reviewer has difficulty finding things to criticize. The book is concise, but covers all the common topics and a little more. It is simply written, yet manages to explain the key concepts remarkably well. Above all, it introduces a comprehensible structure that unifies seemingly different methodologies into a single system. Not counting the introduction chapter, where the need for multiplicity corrections is explained, the book is divided into four parts. The first part is named â€œgeneral concepts,â€ so it is no surprise that the chapter describes the basic framework of multiplicity procedures used throughout the book. It starts with the definition of different error rates, with their uses and relationship to each other. Although, as the authors explain themselves, the familywise error rate is the most common of them all when multiple testing is performed, and thus it is this last that is used in the following chapters, error measures such as false discovery rate and per-comparison error rate are presented. Also the different definitions of power that are used in tests of several hypotheses are mentioned. The authors then describe, in great detail, the main tool that is used in construction of many of the multiplicity corrections named in the book, namely, the combination of the closure principle and the unionâ€“intersection tests. As an illustration they explain how it can be used in a simple way to construct the Holm procedure from Bonferroni tests and Hommel from Simes, although one may wish for a more detailed explanation of the latter. The authors also briefly describe the partitioning principle, stating that it could be a powerful tool, but neglecting to expand the topic further, with this being one of the few disappointments that I met while reading the book.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Vera Lisovskaja"", ids = ""4051773"")",,04fce329cc28993c80a7236c62c153d883af27b3; 2bc4953052b5d1c3923ad4471fad2c35075cb2ec,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics,21,865 - 867

Inspired by the work of Barber and CandÃ¨s (2015), we propose and analyze a pseudoknockoff filter that inherits some advantages of the original knockoff filter and has more flexibility in constructing its knockoff matrix. Although we have not been able to obtain exact FDR control of the pseudo knockoff filter, we show that it satisfies an expectation inequality that offers some insight into FDR control. Moreover, we provide some partial analysis of the pseudo knockoff filter for the half Lasso and the least squares statistics. Our analysis indicates that the inverse of the covariance matrix of the feature matrix plays an important role in designing and analyzing the pseudo knockoff filter. Our preliminary numerical experiments show that the pseudo knockoff filter with the half Lasso statistic has FDR control.

We sought to determine if unique small molecule metabolites contribute to racial differences in HF outcomes. Hypothesis: Small molecule metabolites will contribute to racial differences in HF death and hospitalization. Methods: We performed a metabolome wide association study in 225 Blacks and Whites (46.5% Black) with HFrEF enrolled in the Atlanta Cardiomyopathy Consortium. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to estimate the association of race and small molecule metabolites with a composite primary endpoint of death and HF hospitalization. Results: During a median follow-up of 1114 (IQR 710 - 1422) days, the primary endpoint occurred in 176 (78.2%) patients, including 34 (15.1%) deaths and 174 (77.3%) hospitalizations. Black race was associated with a higher risk for the primary endpoint (adjusted HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.03 - 2.46; P=0.03). 86 metabolites were identified to be differentially expressed between Blacks and Whites at false discovery rate=0.2. The metabolite kynurenate (HR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.06, P=0.04), and two metabolites tentatively identified as nitronaphthalene (HR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.06, P=0.04) and salsolinol (HR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00 - 1.06, P=0.07) were associated with a higher risk of the primary endpoint in the entire cohort. There was a trend towards a race*salsolinol interaction (P=0.06), with Blacks in the highest salsolinol quartile having the highest risk for the primary endpoint, while Whites in the lowest salsolinol quartile had the lowest risk. Race-stratified Cox models confirmed elevated salsolinol levels were associated with increased risk for the primary endpoint in Whites (quartile 4 vs. 1: adjusted HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.18 - 7.96; P=0.02) and Blacks (quartile 4 vs. 1: adjusted HR 2.24, 95% CI 0.93 - 5.40; P=0.07). Conclusions: In a HFrEF cohort, we found 86 metabolites differentially expressed between Blacks and Whites. Kynurenate, and metabolites tentatively identified as nitronaphthalene and salsolinol, were associated with a higher risk of death and HF hospitalization, while that identified as salsolinol was associated with differential risk in Blacks and Whites.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alanna A Morris"", ids = ""21154754""); list(name = ""Karan Uppal"", ids = ""2944354""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Y.

4813507d3e5aef8ead2d102506920ae88222cf7b,Protective Effects of Dietary Intake of Antioxidants and Treatment-Related Toxicity in Childhood Leukemia: A Report From the DALLT Cohort.,"PURPOSE
The benefits and risks of supplementation with antioxidants during cancer therapy have been a controversial area. Few studies have systematically evaluated dietary intake of antioxidants with toxicity and survival in childhood cancer. We sought to determine the role of dietary intake of antioxidants on rates of infections, mucositis, relapse, and disease-free survival during induction and postinduction phases of therapy among children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We enrolled 794 children in a prospective clinical trial for treatment of ALL. Dietary intake was prospectively evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. The association between dietary intake of antioxidants and treatment-related toxicities and survival were evaluated with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (q) and logistic regression and the Kaplan-Meier method, respectively.


RESULTS
Dietary surveys were available for analysis from 614 (77%), and 561 (71%) participants at diagnosis and at end of induction, respectively. Of 513 participants who completed the dietary surveys at both time points, 120 (23%) and 87 (16%) experienced a bacterial infection and 22 (4%) and 55 (10%) experienced mucositis during the induction or postinduction phases of treatment, respectively. Increased intake of dietary antioxidants was associated with significantly lower rates of infection and mucositis. No association with relapse or disease-free survival was observed. Supplementation was not associated with toxicity, relapse, or survival.


CONCLUSION
Consumption of antioxidants through dietary intake was associated with reduced rates of infection or mucositis, with no increased risk of relapse or reduced survival. Dietary counseling on a well-balanced diet that includes an array of antioxidants from food sources alone may confer a benefit from infections and mucositis during treatment of childhood ALL.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elena J.

The genetic determinants of body fat distribution are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to gain new insights into the underlying genetics of body fat distribution by conducting sample-size-weighted fixed-effects genome-wide association meta-analyses in up to 9,594 women and 8,738 men of European, African, Hispanic and Chinese ancestry, with and without sex stratification, for six traits associated with ectopic fat (hereinafter referred to as ectopic-fat traits). In total, we identified seven new loci associated with ectopic-fat traits (ATXN1, UBE2E2, EBF1, RREB1, GSDMB, GRAMD3 and ENSA; P < 5 Ã— 10âˆ’8; false discovery rate < 1%). Functional analysis of these genes showed that loss of function of either Atxn1 or Ube2e2 in primary mouse adipose progenitor cells impaired adipocyte differentiation, suggesting physiological roles for ATXN1 and UBE2E2 in adipogenesis. Future studies are necessary to further explore the mechanisms by which these genes affect adipocyte biology and how their perturbations contribute to systemic metabolic disease.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Audrey Y.

92c6eed771ae20ce356c7f60b40530cec4dbc85a,A Simulation Study of Sequential Testing Approaches in Genetics,"A common issue in case-control genetic association studies is that a large number of markers may be tested in the same case-control group, increasing the False Discovery Rate (FDR) due to multiple comparisons. Sobell (1993) proposed a three-staged sequential testing procedure where a large number of markers are screened by testing consecutively on three independent case-control subgroups. Sham (1994) argued that the use of independent subgroups at each stage, instead of accumulating data, decreases power. Thus, a sequential scheme was suggested, where at each stage the subsamples of previous stages are combined in order to maintain power. It was also suggested that sequential procedures based on Wald (1945) be applied to the problem. This study uses SAS to carry out the sequential procedures proposed by Sobell, Sham, and Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), and compares their properties in regards to power, percentage of genotyping, and FDR. The simulation results suggest that Wald's SPRT is the most efficient sequential scheme among those compared. INTRODUCTION A common problem in case-control genetic association studies is that a large number of markers are tested in the same case-control cohort. For instance, let us consider a cohort composed of two groups (case/control) with 900 subjects each, and 1000 gene expressions per subject. The objective is to find true associations between a disease and any of the gene expressions. From the point of view of statistics, these data bring about three problems: 1) Multiple testing: since we have 1000 gene expressions (also referred to as 'outcomes' throughout this paper) to test on the same cohort, if we don't account for multiplicity, we may increase the Type I error rate, and the observed False Discovery Rate (FDR), which is defined as the number of true null hypothesis rejected divided by the total number of hypothesis rejected. 2) Common multiple testing correction methods such as Bonferroni's correction, greatly decrease power, unless the sample size is increased 3) Large samples needed to maintain power after correction for multiplicity translate into higher genotyping costs. Ideally, we would like a testing scheme that maximizes power while minimizing FDR and genotyping costs.",2006,,"list(name = ""Andres Azuero"", ids = ""3168181""); list(name = ""David T.

f9af132681aada01be5a50b08ad5332c075f7839,Hypergraph-Based Anomaly Detection of High-Dimensional Co-Occurrences,"This paper addresses the problem of detecting anomalous multivariate co-occurrences using a limited number of unlabeled training observations. A novel method based on using a hypergraph representation of the data is proposed to deal with this very high-dimensional problem. Hypergraphs constitute an important extension of graphs which allow edges to connect more than two vertices simultaneously. A variational expectation-maximization algorithm for detecting anomalies directly on the hypergraph domain without any feature selection or dimensionality reduction is presented. The resulting estimate can be used to calculate a measure of anomalousness based on the false discovery rate. The algorithm has O(np) computational complexity, where n is the number of training observations and p is the number of potential participants in each co-occurrence event. This efficiency makes the method ideally suited for very high-dimensional settings, and requires no tuning, bandwidth or regularization parameters. The proposed approach is validated on both high-dimensional synthetic data and the Enron email database, where p > 75,000, and it is shown that it can outperform other state-of-the-art methods.",2009,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jorge G.

Lucky funds have significant estimated alphas, while their true alphas are equal to zero. To address this issue, this paper quantifies the impact of luck with new measures built on the False Discovery Rate (FDR). These FDR measures provide a simple way to compute the proportion of funds with genuine positive or negative performance as well as their location in the cross-sectional alpha distribution. Using a large cross-section of U.S. domestic-equity funds, we find that about one fifth of the funds in the population truly yield negative alphas. These funds are dispersed in the left tail of the alpha distribution. We also find a small proportion of funds with truly positive performance, which are concentrated in the extreme right tail of the alpha distribution.

Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) has a different pathologic burden and clinical features compared with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We examined the effects of age at onset on the burden and distribution of Î²-amyloid in patients with EOAD, in whom well-characterized mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease were absent.


METHODS
We genotyped ApoE, APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 in the patients with Alzheimer's disease: 9 patients with EOAD (age <65), 11 with LOAD (age >70) and 8 normal controls (NCs), all of whom had undergone 11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography imaging.


RESULTS
Patients with EOAD exhibited higher z scores and larger cluster sizes, and retained higher levels of Pittsburgh compound B in the bilateral thalamus and in some parts of the globus pallidus (P<0.05, false discovery rate).


CONCLUSION
Distribution of amyloid deposition in EOAD outside the context of genetic mutations topographically showed some differences from that in LOAD.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Young Chul Youn"", ids = ""3689672""); list(name = ""Jae-Won Jang"", ids = ""47267525""); list(name = ""Su-Hyun Han"", ids = ""4212754""); list(name = ""HyeRyoun Kim"", ids = ""5304427""); list(name = ""Ju-Won Seok"", ids = ""79273751""); list(name = ""Jun Soo Byun"", ids = ""2294710""); list(name = ""Kwang-yeol Park"", ids = ""108820824""); list(name = ""Seong Soo A An"", ids = ""3653400""); list(name = ""In Kook Chun"", ids = ""4603727""); list(name = ""Sangyun Kim"", ids = ""2296186"")",4b0d83ecb41c5c86df9ffe4d55168bbb8ab9beb8; af89c22bc4e33156682a4d82185055009a6261e4; 9aa37a7a581e352a1c3f0e615fc3ebef1f2b8e26; a7a266e3c39f08c539c8d90c22b3c0c13b5ee923; 2e0a919f8ac53429e5039956bc2cb5b0ca487c28,ff49de5707b7cf1ab2e3efd8336a8e0ba6c5d30d; 619cd1363e575153953b1364582103560df14502; e8b0a42693a00c7b992aab9f981534c6b6296d00; fdc2a17e5eebb919409605b7778be281574ddbaa; 01a3fb733f0447b63f583c5fa169855a85645550; e4c6fe0f9d8d7bc93ecb34c4bee444ec2014364e; 259d4a9c4bf3906292eecd1a5b62c9160ca5b7a0; cefb4466e87b6d1d84b80bc798e81343e43fec3e; 048655d48811f8c1f8ff43b5320e894797e5b225; b3570348d6355a5d82024a7e23d2b745ae018569; 70eb8cbfce5a7c94431a1b8f95e7651eff4b1d6f; 5eb662207876a87edf32b11ef9ba2f4a76d3c181; cd96b9630b826ad48f3370e2a63ef53e198aab1c; 05e5a8a529bee961ffd41d5d51810b958479fdb0; 8c1252d5b1e1fd7afb794128592bd3776380f037; 18e0498541e94be292532677b3111d6db88c1078; e5be7613502923cc6168d6f86d0c1068abab0910; 8c911aa5277a069da3f05aae8be4a8eafe797e2c; 04db7fc773d8da9d404494066e38cd11ad84f8a2; 392940b112f9014b5076273420f37a6137e2f27d; 6f7d0c6e7c2ea099f2bc8fa5a21ee06e8d757447; 1c222c52e05d37342efdd91239d928d3db01d166; 204d5520270562a13510f3a8f9e38cc4e6dab858; 2c0f1fc88b25e5a5fbddef1f9969e4e38a841242,Clinical Interventions in Aging,12,1041 - 1048
b6f22fdd765e8dfb27e7629dcd84f4462407220e,Transcriptomic profile of leg muscle during early growth in chicken,"The early growth pattern, especially the age of peak growth, of broilers affects the time to market and slaughter weight, which in turn affect the profitability of the poultry industry. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating chicken growth and development have rarely been studied. This study aimed to identify candidate genes involved in chicken growth and investigated the potential regulatory mechanisms of early growth in chicken. RNA sequencing was applied to compare the transcriptomes of chicken muscle tissues at three developmental stages during early growth. In total, 978 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (fold change â‰¥ 2; false discovery rate < 0.05) were detected by pairwise comparison. Functional analysis showed that the DEGs are mainly involved in the processes of cell growth, muscle development, and cellular activities (such as junction, migration, assembly, differentiation, and proliferation). Many of the DEGs are well known to be related to chicken growth, such as MYOD1, GH, IGF2BP2, IGFBP3, SMYD1, CEBPB, FGF2, and IGFBP5. KEGG pathway analysis identified that the DEGs were significantly enriched in five pathways (P < 0.1) related to growth and development: extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, tight junction, insulin signaling pathway, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. A total of 42 DEGs assigned to these pathways are potential candidate genes inducing the difference in growth among the three developmental stages, such as MYH10, FGF2, FGF16, FN1, CFL2, MAPK9, IRS1, PHKA1, PHKB, and PHKG1. Thus, our study identified a series of genes and several pathways that may participate in the regulation of early growth in chicken.

987188d6df3a04b262fd918077fe2da855503cc9,A unified framework for finding differentially expressed genes from microarray experiments,"BackgroundThis paper presents a unified framework for finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the microarray data. The proposed framework has three interrelated modules: (i) gene ranking, ii) significance analysis of genes and (iii) validation. The first module uses two gene selection algorithms, namely, a) two-way clustering and b) combined adaptive ranking to rank the genes. The second module converts the gene ranks into p-values using an R-test and fuses the two sets of p-values using the Fisher's omnibus criterion. The DEGs are selected using the FDR analysis. The third module performs three fold validations of the obtained DEGs. The robustness of the proposed unified framework in gene selection is first illustrated using false discovery rate analysis. In addition, the clustering-based validation of the DEGs is performed by employing an adaptive subspace-based clustering algorithm on the training and the test datasets. Finally, a projection-based visualization is performed to validate the DEGs obtained using the unified framework.ResultsThe performance of the unified framework is compared with well-known ranking algorithms such as t-statistics, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), Adaptive Ranking, Combined Adaptive Ranking and Two-way Clustering. The performance curves obtained using 50 simulated microarray datasets each following two different distributions indicate the superiority of the unified framework over the other reported algorithms. Further analyses on 3 real cancer datasets and 3 Parkinson's datasets show the similar improvement in performance. First, a 3 fold validation process is provided for the two-sample cancer datasets. In addition, the analysis on 3 sets of Parkinson's data is performed to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method to multi-sample microarray datasets.ConclusionThis paper presents a unified framework for the robust selection of genes from the two-sample as well as multi-sample microarray experiments. Two different ranking methods used in module 1 bring diversity in the selection of genes. The conversion of ranks to p-values, the fusion of p-values and FDR analysis aid in the identification of significant genes which cannot be judged based on gene ranking alone. The 3 fold validation, namely, robustness in selection of genes using FDR analysis, clustering, and visualization demonstrate the relevance of the DEGs. Empirical analyses on 50 artificial datasets and 6 real microarray datasets illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The analyses on 3 cancer datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on microarray datasets with two classes of samples.

63ecc1dca2aa641d8f256a3febcb72e22bcbc7a2,Genome-wide association mapping for leaf tip necrosis and pseudo-black chaff in relation to durable rust resistance in wheat,"The partial rust resistance genes Lr34 and Sr2 have been used extensively in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement, as they confer exceptional durability. Interestingly, the resistance of Lr34 is associated with the expression of leaf tip necrosis (LTN) and Sr2 with pseudo-black chaff (PBC). Genome-wide association mapping using CIMMYTâ€™s stem rust resistance screening nursery (SRRSN) wheat lines was done to identify genotyping-bysequencing (GBS) markers linked to LTN and PBC. Phenotyping for these traits was done in Ithaca, New York (fall 2011); Njoro, Kenya (main and off-seasons, 2012), and Wellington, India (winter, 2013). Using the mixed linear model (MLM), 18 GBS markers were significantly associated with LTN. While some markers were linked to loci where the durable leaf rust resistance genes Lr34 (7DS), Lr46 (1BL), and Lr68 (7BL) were mapped, significant associations were also detected with other loci on 2BL, 5B, 3BS, 4BS, and 7BS. Twelve GBS markers linked to the Sr2 locus (3BS) and loci on 2DS, 4AL, and 7DS were significantly associated with PBC. This study provides insight into the complex genetic control of LTN and PBC. Further efforts to validate and study these loci might aid in determining the nature of their association with durable resistance. The rust diseases, which include leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., stem rust caused by P. graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici, and stripe rust caused by P. striiformis West. f. sp. tritici., are the major biotic stresses that affect global wheat production. Although several rust resistance genes have been identified, most of them are race specific and can be easily overcome by new virulent races of the pathogen (Samborski, 1985; McIntosh et al., 1995; Pretorius et al., 2000; Wanyera et al., 2006). To circumvent this challenge, rust resistance breeding has shifted its focus to achieving nonrace-specific, widespread, prolonged resistance, also known as durable resistance (Johnson, 1984). This is usually characterized by slow rusting, partial, and adult plant resistance (APR) expressed at the postseedling stage with extended latent periods that delay the spread of the disease (Caldwell, 1968; Parlevliet, 1975; Kolmer, 1996). Among the cataloged rust resistance genes, Lr34/Yr18/Sr57/Pm38/Sb1/Ltn1 (hereafter referred to as Lr34) and Sr2/Yr30/Lr27/Pbc1 (hereafter referred to as Sr2) have been deployed widely for several decades due to their exceptional durability.

0b974f02762f987b7a3e8ff7f17fb6da8c4467c7,An efficient Monte Carlo approach to assessing statistical significance in genomic studies,"MOTIVATION
Multiple hypothesis testing is a common problem in genome research, particularly in microarray experiments and genomewide association studies. Failure to account for the effects of multiple comparisons would result in an abundance of false positive results. The Bonferroni correction and Holm's step-down procedure are overly conservative, whereas the permutation test is time-consuming and is restricted to simple problems.


RESULTS
We developed an efficient Monte Carlo approach to approximating the joint distribution of the test statistics along the genome. We then used the Monte Carlo distribution to evaluate the commonly used criteria for error control, such as familywise error rates and positive false discovery rates. This approach is applicable to any data structures and test statistics. Applications to simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach provides accurate error control, and can be substantially more powerful than the Bonferroni and Holm methods, especially when the test statistics are highly correlated.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""D.

1e72fb61d0edb9267bf5b03df8a4ed49d9ad43a1,Still waters run deep: latent cytokine activity in nonlesional psoriasis skin.,"Despite looking superficially unremarkable, the clinically uninvolved skin of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis has been shown to have a number of distinctions when compared with the skin of healthy control volunteers. The Koebner response, first described in 1876, as well as other studies on the abnormesverhalten or the abnormal behaviour of uninvolved skin, began to establish these differences but their underlying mechanisms could only be the subject of conjecture. Reports from the 1980s, making use of newly available monoclonal antibodies, found increased numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the uninvolved skin of patients with guttate psoriasis, which gave an immunological basis to these discussions. Over the last 15 years, transcriptomic studies using microarrays, and later RNA-seq, have revealed a striking pattern of differential gene expression between lesional psoriasis skin and clinically uninvolved skin. However, fewer studies have focused on the differences between clinically uninvolved skin and the normal skin of unaffected control subjects. The first direct treatment of such revealed that while clinically uninvolved skin and healthy skin transcriptomes appeared to cluster together, setting a threshold to count all genes at least 1 3-fold altered in expression (with false discovery rate corrected P-value < 0 05) identified 58 genes upregulated and 121 genes downregulated in uninvolved psoriatic skin. These 179 differentially expressed genes encoded proteins involved in epidermal differentiation, antimicrobial defences, lipid metabolism and regulation of cutaneous vasculature. These results identified a â€˜prepsoriaticâ€™ gene expression signature within uninvolved skin and pointed to decreased lipid biosynthesis and increased innate immunity in clinically uninvolved psoriatic skin. In this issue of the BJD, Chiricozzi and colleagues show that uninvolved psoriasis skin, distant from lesions, displays the molecular signature of interleukin (IL)-17 activity, in that there is elevated expression of genes downstream of IL-17, suggesting that the increased levels of IL-17 circulating in the blood of patients with psoriasis impacts nonlesional skin. Expanding on this, the authors use gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a powerful statistical tool to identify significantly enriched or underrepresented groups of genes within large datasets (e.g. cDNA microarrays, RNA-seq or proteomics datasets). In this instance, the authors show that within the transcriptome of nonlesional psoriasis skin hides the gene set upregulated in psoriasis lesions, as well as keratinocyte gene sets induced by the action of IL-17A, IL17A+TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-a and IL-17A+IL-22, key cytokines in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Interestingly, GSEA also detected the presence of T-helper (Th)1, Th17, Th22 and Th2 T-cell signatures in the nonlesional skin. This was likely a result of circulating cytokines acting on the uninvolved skin, but also could suggest the presence of resting resident memory T cells, particularly in resolved lesions; alternatively this â€˜residual disease genomic profileâ€™ could be the â€˜molecular scarâ€™ remaining in formerly lesional skin. Given these most recent observations and the development of multiomics studies harnessing transcriptomics, lipidomics, proteomics, epigenetics and genetics, we are approaching an era where we will be able to provide a full mechanistic rationale for the â€˜abnormal behaviourâ€™ of clinically uninvolved skin.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew Johnston"", ids = ""145492154""); list(name = ""Zihan Yin"", ids = ""10713895""); list(name = ""Johann E Gudjonsson"", ids = ""3580322"")",,56060790fbd10e780f6b76ce2e9547cd717bba82; f4018c9cf8421af18d8e4e1b5dfb7a903b012eb8; 2cdcac4f9efc3247b1090cc99e14d96860683706; 766a82ffff16662dba74666bcdc6bd9db61ebab0; 51d02526aa36effc4d0eedb5649b37a0fbfc57eb; 21ffc64421b6bbaea86f922b3f8bc397ab651a30; 9c8dc03aa4a8884fece208eac61e0679d56966e4; 9d5084d2e55208a75ed1b9018d42d14a6b043116,The British journal of dermatology,174 1,"

e9b0af9cbfcbc0f0ac59743e441eb4c3d49f45d5,Regularized methods for high-dimensional and bi-level variable selection,"Many traditional approaches to statistical analysis cease to be useful when the number of variables is large in comparison with the sample size. Penalized regression methods have proved to be an attractive approach, both theoretically and empirically, for dealing with these problems. This thesis focuses on the development of penalized regression methods for high-dimensional variable selection. The first part of this thesis deals with problems in which the covariates possess a grouping structure that can be incorporated into the analysis to select important groups as well as important members of those groups. I introduce a framework for grouped penalization that encompasses the previously proposed group lasso and group bridge methods, sheds light on the behavior of grouped penalties, and motivates the proposal of a new method, group MCP. The second part of this thesis develops fast algorithms for fitting models with complicated penalty functions such as grouped penalization methods. These algorithms combine the idea of local approximation of penalty functions with recent research into coordinate descent algorithms to produce highly efficient numerical methods for fitting models with complicated penalties. Importantly, I show these algorithms to be both stable and linear in the dimension of the feature space, allowing them to be efficiently scaled up to very large problems. In the third part of this thesis, I extend the idea of false discovery rates to penalized regression. I show how the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions describing penalized regression estimates provide testable hypotheses involving partial residuals, thus connecting the previously disparate fields of multiple comparisons and penalized regression. I then propose two approaches to estimating false discovery rates for penalized regression methods and examine the accuracy of these approaches.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Patrick J Breheny"", ids = ""2119683"")",2b62d1d8c46b5550ad8a88648038e0d3b6f13996; 5b155f018c9169a3f02cfcbed9563d16165ec233,96c5ebfcb1409b59323a56864991197c0fd5f719; afc473ea8e7e923246b27bd2790d71d93dffbadb; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; c8c66af8271d17092b8e2fa575d6e129bc06a564; 1ee94dd6ece86a1db9f9fea39b9587f6073e21bf; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e; 12e5939a80ec59f81214d7e729c577c350af9501; 53dc97756369cd1f9300116d6aabdffb7072f2ed; a9e0444b694a804a9088a622a6123e10a04430ae; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; d4783d05ae9dd82a53883d33a767ef4ab0af789b; 5a607f6990bdf37fa2623be43ede7fd55b5bed79; ea54f0c0568cab38619ee51e6ac021e76d6a6559; e9133969c2fa2113948a2698a3f5ced97e219781; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; 5d72ad3c372ef741697382b75d0be5e91a73fa3b; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 1c7c5595dc7a1f5d360acf5c360ca1ca49536ba5; 63c68278418b69f60b4814fae8dd15b1b1854295; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; 400b45a803d642b752a84147ef547af7811e8f3f; 7aa39f7f3b69473705e247dd2b3a9689f10fbbc3; 5e3c9778500da38bd75e4497239d129c509f066c,,,
a90ef01b829c2db4940e17764c1f3d2ac08a7d20,FDR- and FWE-controlling methods using data-driven weights,"Weighted methods are an important feature of multiplicity control methods.

Purpose: The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility for developing prognostic protein biomarkers in serum samples from patients undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for organ confined prostate cancers.

Methods: 130 patients presenting with organ confined prostate cancers were treated with SBRT to doses of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Peripheral blood samples were collected prospectively from patients at time 0 prior to radiation and serially after the first treatment (24 hours), follow-up months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 during the first year, and every 6 months thereafter, for up to 3 years. Processed study samples were analyzed by SomaLogic, Inc., using the SOMAscan Version 3 proteomic assay. Statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed data, with statistically significant differences identified by evaluating false discovery rate corrected p-values. Protein correlations were discovered with the Jonckheere-Terpstra (JT) test. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to analyze cellular signaling pathways. PSA levels and clinical recurrence information were prospectively obtained at each follow-up visit and maintained in an institutional database.

Results:

Patient stratification by risk assessment identified 27 low-, 71 intermediate- and 32 high-risk patients in the study cohort. Proteins that function in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, protein signaling, gonad development, and cell migration correlated with Gleason's grade. CGA.LHB, KLK3, and CNTFR correlated both with tumor stage and Gleason's grade. With a median follow up of 3 years, ten patients experienced biochemical failures. While no proteins identified as differentially expressed in recurrent patients achieved significance, IPA pathway analysis of the top differentially expressed proteins converged on the IL-6 canonical pathway.

183 proteins were attributed to radiation effects on differential expression in patients by comparing pre-treatment to the 3 months post-treatment specimens. IPA network pathway analyses of these paired samples revealed changes in cell activation and signaling pathways, with the primary regulatory networks associated with ERK1/2, NF-ÎºB, IFNG, ADIPOQ, histone 3, and histone 4. Of particular interest, high adiponectin levels in patients presenting with higher tumor stage decreased after radiation exposure, underscoring the potential for this molecule as a signal for determining response to radiation treatment.

Conclusion:

These hypothesis-generating experiments show differential serum protein levels in prostate cancer patient cohorts that have been stratified by risk factors and in longitudinal studies of patients following treatment with SBRT. Candidate biomarker proteins and molecular pathways have been identified for validation as potential predictors of prostate cancer response to radiation treatment.

It was proposed that malaria parasite-specific low molecular-weight metabolites could be used as biomarkers for the development of a malaria diagnostic tool aimed to address this diagnostic challenge. In this study, high resolution metabolomics (HRM) was employed to identify malaria parasite-specific metabolites in Plasmodium falciparum in vitro culture samples.MethodsSupernatants were collected at 12 hours interval from 3% haematocrit in vitro 48-hour time-course asynchronized culture system of P. falciparum. Liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry was applied to discover potential parasite-specific metabolites in the cell culture supernatant. A metabolome-wide association study was performed to extract metabolites using Manhattan plot with false discovery rate (FDR) and hierarchical cluster analysis. The significant metabolites based on FDR cutoff were annotated using Metlin database. Standard curves were created using corresponding chemical compounds to accurately quantify potential Plasmodium-specific metabolites in culture supernatants.ResultsThe number of significant metabolite features was 1025 in the supernatant of the Plasmodium infected culture based on Manhattan plot with FDR q=0.05. A two way hierarchical cluster analysis showed a clear segregation of the metabolic profile of parasite infected supernatant from non-infected supernatant at four time points during the 48 hour culture. Among the 1025 annotated metabolites, the intensities of four molecules were significantly increased with culture time suggesting a positive association between the quantity of these molecules and level of parasitaemia: i) 3-methylindole, a mosquito attractant, ii) succinylacetone, a haem biosynthesis inhibitor, iii) S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and iv) O-arachidonoyl glycidol, a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, The highest concentrations of 3-methylindole and succinylacetone were 178 Â± 18.7 pmoles at 36 hours and 157Â±30.5 pmoles at 48 hours respectively in parasite infected supernatant.ConclusionHRM with bioinformatics identified four potential parasite-specific metabolite biomarkers using in vitro culture supernatants.

e3d2e742ebf4359385fe6fc17eeb470e17762820,Abstract B69: Aggressiveness and tumor biology in prostate cancer patients with and without biochemical recurrence,"Background: Prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) using standard measures to assign risk classification in prostate cancer (PCa) patients at diagnosis is not precise. While in some patients BCR may happen sooner than expected in others, it may take several years before it appears. It is then necessary to devise better tools to predict accurately BCR. Our goal was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cases with and without BCR within the risk groups determined by D9Amico (defined by the clinical stage, initial PSA, and Gleason stage in biopsy). Methods: We ran RNA-seq analysis in 52 Hispanic PCa patients with early BCR (within 5 years after the surgery) and 57 with no BCR in the same period of time. The cases were classified as high, intermediate, or low according to the D9Amico classification. Analyses were done using the DESeq2 package. Genes with p value adjusted by False Discovery Rate (padj) less than 0.05 and fold change (FC) > 2 were considered statistically significant. Pathway analysis was performed in MetaCore. Results: We found 4,281 DEGs (padj 2). In contrast, 4,647 DEGs were associated with tumor tissues in cases without BCR (16 with FC > 2). Of these genes, nine (CHRM3, CLDN8, ERG, GDF15, LUZP2, OR51E1, PTPRT, TRGC1, TPO) were exclusively found in cases without BCR, and one, ONECUT2, was exclusive for tissues with BCR. All these genes, except TRGC1, have been associated before with PCa: the Cholinergic Receptor Muscarinic 3 (CHRM3) and the Olfactory Receptor Family 51 Subfamily E Member 1 (OR51E1) have a growth-promoting role; Claudin 8 (CLDN8) is transcriptionally activated by the androgen receptor to promote progression of PCa; ETS Trancription Factor (ERG) participates in chromosomal translocation in PCa and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis; Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) was reported to be part of a circulating tumor cell profile in castration-resistant PCa with high levels associated with poor survival; Leucine Zipper Protein 2 (LUZP2) seems to contribute to enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant PCa; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type T (PTPRT) was recently found overexpressed in localized PCa; Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) promotes resistance to cell death and to chemotherapy in PCa; and ONECUT2 has been associated with different types of cancer and recently with prostate cancer. Pathway analysis of DEGs identified IL-6 signaling pathway via MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT cascades; PPAR pathway activation (which involves transcription factors belonging to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and activated by fatty acids); and Adenosine A2B receptor signaling, which indirectly activates c-Myc, Cyclin D1, PI3K/AKT, and IL-6 in patients with BCR. On the other hand, IL-15 signaling via JAK-STAT cascade, WNT signaling pathway, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, and survival through NGF/TrkA PI3K-mediating signaling and mTORC2 downstream signaling pathways were identified in the group without BCR. These differences show that DEGs in both groups, even though implicated in processes related with tumor development, are involved in specific pathways that can be associated with the grade of aggressiveness of the tumors, and also, under specific circumstances, lead to BCR. In addition, we found that DEGs can separate BCR from no BCR cases within each risk group, suggesting that a genomic signature with DEGs is a better predictor of BCR than the clinically assigned risk groups. Conclusions: Tumor biology and signaling pathways activated in cases with BCR are different from those in cases without BCR, showing that aggressiveness of tumors can be found at the moment of surgery and that biomarkers of prognosis can be identified at this point.

The beta-2 adrenergic receptor, encoded by the ADRB2 gene, mediates several effects of catecholamine hormones and neurotransmitters in bone. We investigated whether NMU single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes, as well as functional ADRB2 SNPs, are associated with bone stiffness in children from the IDEFICS cohort, also evaluating whether NMU and ADRB2 interact to affect this trait. A sample of 2,274 subjects (52.5% boys, age 6.2 Â± 1.8 years) from eight European countries, having data on calcaneus bone stiffness index (SI, mean of both feet) and genotyping (NMU gene: rs6827359, rs12500837, rs9999653; ADRB2 gene: rs1042713, rs1042714), was studied. After false discovery rate adjustment, SI was significantly associated with all NMU SNPs. rs6827359 CC homozygotes showed the strongest association (recessive model, Î”=â€Š-1.8, p=0.006). Among the five retrieved haplotypes with frequencies higher than 1% (range 2.0-43.9%), the CCT haplotype (frequency=39.7%) was associated with lower SI values (dominant model, Î”=â€Š-1.0, p=0.04) as compared to the most prevalent haplotype. A non-significant decrease in SI was observed in in ADRB2 rs1042713 GG homozygotes, while subjects carrying SI-lowering genotypes at both SNPs (frequencyâ€Š=â€Š8.4%) showed much lower SI than non-carriers (Î”=â€Š-3.9, p<0.0001; p for interaction=0.025). The association was more evident in preschool girls, in whom SI showed a curvilinear trend across ages. In subgroup analyses, rs9999653 CC NMU or both GG ADRB2 genotypes were associated with either lower serum calcium or Î²-CrossLaps levels (p=0.01).

796a4b420761aa00231fe8e8d21cad3fd9b083f7,Association of cord blood methylation with neonatal leptin: An epigenome wide association study,"BACKGROUND
Neonatal adiposity is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Investigating contributors to neonatal adiposity is important for understanding early life obesity risk. Epigenetic changes of metabolic genes in cord blood may contribute to excessive neonatal adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity. This study aims to evaluate the association of cord blood DNA methylation patterns with anthropometric measures and cord blood leptin, a biomarker of neonatal adiposity.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was performed on a multiethnic cohort of 114 full term neonates born to mothers without gestational diabetes at a university hospital. Cord blood was assayed for leptin and for epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles via the Illumina 450K platform. Neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze associations between individual CpG sites as well as differentially methylated regions in cord blood DNA with measures of newborn adiposity including anthropometrics (birth weight, fat mass and percent body fat) and cord blood leptin. False discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
247 CpG sites as well as 18 differentially methylated gene regions were associated with cord blood leptin but no epigenetic changes were associated with birth weight, fat mass or percent body fat. Genes of interest identified in this study are DNAJA4, TFR2, SMAD3, PLAG1, FGF1, and HNF4A.


CONCLUSION
Epigenetic changes in cord blood DNA are associated with cord blood leptin levels, a measure of neonatal adiposity.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel Kadakia"", ids = ""4743516""); list(name = ""Yinan Zheng"", ids = ""2112470""); list(name = ""Zhou Zhang"", ids = ""15793298""); list(name = ""Weiya Zhang"", ids = ""40538931""); list(name = ""Jami L.

In addition, the genome sequences of important model systems used in biological, medical and pharmacological experiments are also available (Waterston et al. 2002, Gibbs et al. 2004). After genome sequencing studies, the focus was shifting to transcriptomics and proteomics. Transcriptomics studies the levels of transcripted mRNA (transcriptome) in cells or tissues. Proteomics is initially concerned with determining the structure, expression, localization, biochemical activity, interactions and cellular roles of as many proteins as possible (de Hoog and Mann, 2004). In other words, proteomics is a large-scale study of the proteome. The term "" proteome "" was described in the 1990 "" s: the PROTEin complement expressed by a genOME (Wilkins et al. 1996). The cellular proteome is a dynamic and complex network of proteins. Due to the fact that only a fraction of mRNA is translated to proteins, mRNA levels are relatively weak predictors of protein â€¦",2011,Chemistry,"list(name = ""FÃ¶ldi IstvÃ¡n"", ids = ""117131442"")",,04625cb00833028451eb8cd78ef9d3bd09609152;

46e5435df4c8a9a7673006a9dc677db37ecd319d,Proteomic analysis of pre- and post-sunitinib treated renal cancer tissue to assess tumor heterogeneity and differential protein expression.,"388 Background: To investigate acquired resistance of clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) patients to sunitinib and develop personalised treatment strategies, sequential tissue after a specific period of targeted therapy is required. This approach has proven successful with targeted therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia; however, we are concerned that extensive tumour heterogeneity occurs in ccRCC. In this study we evaluated heterogeneity and differential protein expression in sunitinib treated and untreated ccRCC samples using high-throughput proteomics.


METHODS
Fresh frozen tissue was obtained from 27 sunitinib naÃ¯ve ccRCC specimens and 27 nephrectomy samples from patients treated with neoadjuvant sunitinib (18 weeks) as part of the SuMR trial. From each tumour frozen sections were performed and up to 5 protein lysates obtained from each morphologically differing region of each tumour as well as matched normal kidney. Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were performed to assess the levels of multiple proteins relevant to ccRCC pathogenesis and sunitinib activity. Appropriate statistical tests were used to examine protein heterogeneity and differential expression, including false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Kaplan-Meier method was used to correlate changes in protein expression with outcome.


RESULTS
Expression of 20 proteins has been examined to date. The range of expression in tumours normalised by matched normal renal tissue had >2-fold differences in untreated (n=8 proteins) and treated samples (n=4 proteins). Four markers displayed significantly increased inter-tumoural variance in sunitinib treated tumours compared with untreated tissue (e.g. VEGFR1, FDR P<0.05). Despite this heterogeneity, sunitinib was associated with significant expression changes for several key proteins (e.g. VEGFR2, CyclinD2; FDR P<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Protein expression in ccRCC is heterogenous and key proteins showed significantly increased variance of expression with sunitinib therapy. Despite heterogeneity, significant changes in protein expression can be identified with sunitinib treatment and have been correlated with outcome.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Grant D.

50db1caeeb1072cbda709ed45c013afd3e3f0014,Statistics Methodologies for Neuroconnectivity Analysis Using fMRI Data in Autism,"Previous research has identified a series of impairments in neuroconnectivity in autism, leading to the under-connectivity theory. However, several recent studies provided evidence that neural network was actually over-connected, but not under-connected as previously thought, in autism. These apparent discrepancies can be attributed to the drawbacks in study design and statistical methods. First of all, most previous studies suffered from small sample size, a problem that rendered these studies to be underpowered. Secondly, these studies failed to account for two critical sources of variation: difference among subjects and variation among sites. As a result, the estimated difference between patient and control and its standard error were not accurate. This not only decreased the efficiency of analysis but also lead to biased inferences. 

In this work we took advantage of the largest autism database, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange(ABIDE). Our analyses included 361 subjects from 8 medical centers. We believed that the sample size in this work avoided the 'underpower' issue in most previous studies. 

By implementing EM algorithm, which iterated between E step that used empirical Bayesian to estimate random effect and M step which evaluated fixed effect via MLE, we were able to obtain accurate estimate of difference between patient and control and its standard error. After applying false discovery rate control, we identified 12 links with significant difference between patient and control. 

The second statistical methodology that we implemented in this work was Bayesian hierarchical modeling. In the work, we fitted this model to ABIDE data. 

The FDR control approach in the above-mentioned methods failed to account for the correlation among statistical tests. As fMRI data was obtained from different regions of the same brain, it was highly unlikely that the statistical tests were independent. Principal factor approximation was recently proposed to implement FDR control in the presence of dependence structure. We applied PFA to the ABIDE dataset and identified links with significant difference in autism.

Lastly, the three above-mentioned methods did not take into account site effect, which could be an important source of variation. We performed meta-analysis by conducting separate analysis by site and then combined analysis with weight equal to the inverse of standard error. Meta-analysis identified additional significant links.",2016,Psychology,"list(name = ""Fei Jie"", ids = ""48203131"")",,,,,

In this study, we assessed sorafenib, an antineoplastic agent and inhibitor of multiple kinases important in angiogenesis [VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1-3, PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-beta, Raf-1 kinase] as a potential PH therapy. Two PH rat models were used: a conventional hypoxia-induced PH model and an augmented PH model combining dual VEGFR-1 and -2 inhibition (SU-5416, single 20 mg/kg injection) with hypoxia. In addition to normoxia-exposed control animals, four groups were maintained at 10% inspired O(2) fraction for 3.5 wk (hypoxia/vehicle, hypoxia/SU-5416, hypoxia/sorafenib, and hypoxia/SU-5416/sorafenib). Compared with normoxic control animals, rats exposed to hypoxia/SU-5416 developed hemodynamic and histological evidence of severe PH while rats exposed to hypoxia alone displayed only mild elevations in hemodynamic values (pulmonary vascular and right ventricular pressures). Sorafenib treatment (daily gavage, 2.5 mg/kg) prevented hemodynamic changes and demonstrated dramatic attenuation of PH-associated vascular remodeling. Compared with normoxic control rats, expression profiling (Affymetrix platform) of lung RNA obtained from hypoxia [false discovery rate (FDR) 6.5%]- and hypoxia/SU-5416 (FDR 1.6%)-challenged rats yielded 1,019 and 465 differentially regulated genes (fold change >1.4), respectively. A novel molecular signature consisting of 38 differentially expressed genes between hypoxia/SU-5416 and hypoxia/SU-5416/sorafenib (FDR 6.7%) was validated by either real-time RT-PCR or immunoblotting. Finally, immunoblotting studies confirmed the upregulation of the MAPK cascade in both PH models, which was abolished by sorafenib. In summary, sorafenib represents a novel potential treatment for severe PH with the MAPK cascade a potential canonical target.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Liliana Moreno-Vinasco"", ids = ""1401582078""); list(name = ""Mardi Gombergâ\200\220Maitland"", ids = ""1398310696""); list(name = ""Michael L.

ee121c6105086bb7b07b05584ddd022db91b5491,Transcriptional Changes in the Mouse Retina after Ocular Blast Injury: A Role for the Immune System.,"Abstract Ocular blast injury is a major medical concern for soldiers and explosion victims due to poor visual outcomes. To define the changes in gene expression following a blast injury to the eye, we examined retinal ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression in 54 mouse strains 5 days after a single 50-psi overpressure air wave blast injury. We observe that almost 40% of genes are differentially expressed with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.001, even though the nominal changes in RNA expression are rather small. Moreover, we find through machine learning approaches that genetic networks related to the innate and acquired immune system are activated. Accompanied by lymphocyte invasion into the inner retina, blast injury also results in progressive loss of visual function and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Collectively, these data demonstrate how systems genetics can be used to put meaning to the transcriptome changes following ocular blast injury that eventually lead to blindness.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""L StruebingFelix"", ids = ""150195048""); list(name = ""KingRebecca"", ids = ""150182246""); list(name = ""Li-ying"", ids = ""69487288""); list(name = ""A ChrenekMicah"", ids = ""150008775""); list(name = ""N LyuboslavskyPolina"", ids = ""150247049""); list(name = ""S SidhuCurran"", ids = ""150307210""); list(name = ""I Bruce Michael"", ids = ""12284953""); list(name = ""E GeisertEldon"", ids = ""150090151"")",bbab406233a9bf53a9fe27b929465d8483b4c75e; 3b261d1632cb2ec6ce329572ea0b6f56419b3d10; 9b267dc98bb955bb50b7bc5b8ff5550c3d4286d1,,Journal of Neurotrauma,35,118-129
f48b72062371f0fa1e6e61fdaa33dc14545018de,"Discovery, Identification and Localization of Post-Translational Modifications","Mass spectrometry based analysis of post-translational modifications commonly report thousands of modified-peptide identifications accompanied by both precisely and ambiguously localized modification sites. Since these identifications often motivate extensive follow up studies, the confident identification of the peptide and accurate localization of the modification site(s) remains one of the major challenges in computational proteomics. As revealed by the 2010 iPRG study on identification of phosphopeptides and localization of phosphorylation sites, participants only attempted to call the modification sites for less than 2 out of every 3 identified spectra and actually disagreed on over 20% of all cases where at least two participants called a modification site. In this talk we will cover current and novel methods for identification of post-translationally modified peptides and automated determination of site localization confidence scores and false discovery rates.",2011,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nuno Bandeira"", ids = ""2865038"")",,,Journal of biomolecular techniques,22,
2492df5727ac33bdd82f04c5e8fd52d7f9f27999,Cross-sectional analysis of cognitive function in the MACS with multivariate normative comparisons.,"BACKGROUND
Prevalence estimates of cognitive impairment in HIV disease vary widely. Here we used multivariate normative comparison (MNC) to identify individuals with impaired cognition, and to compare the results with those using the Frascati and GisslÃ©n criteria.


METHODS
This project used data collected before October 2014 from bisexual/gay men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. 2,904 men (mean age 39.7yr, 52.7% seropositive) had complete data in six cognitive domains at their first neuropsychological evaluation. T-scores were computed for each domain and the MNC was applied to detect impairment among seronegative and seropositive groups.


RESULTS
The MNC classified 6.26% of seronegative men as being impaired using a predetermined 5% false discovery rate (FDR). By contrast, the Frascati and the GisslÃ©n criteria identified 24.54% and 11.36% of seronegative men as impaired. For seropositive men, the percent impairment was 7.45%, 25.73%, and 11.69%, respectively, by the MNC, Frascati and GisslÃ©n criteria. When we used seronegative men without medical comorbidities as the control group, the MNC, the Frascati and the GisslÃ©n criteria identified 5.05%, 27.07% and 4.21% of the seronegative men, and 4.34%, 30.95%, and 4.48% of the seropositive men as having cognitive impairment. For each method, serostatus was not associated with cognitive impairment.


CONCLUSIONS
The MNC controls the FDR and therefore avoids the low specificity that characterizes the Frascati and GisslÃ©n criteria. More research is needed to evaluate the sensitivity of the MNC method in a seropositive population that may be sicker and older than the current study sample and that includes women.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhencheng Wang"", ids = ""9514006""); list(name = ""Samantha A Molsberry"", ids = ""6215509""); list(name = ""Yu Cheng"", ids = ""5524736""); list(name = ""Lawrence Kingsley"", ids = ""34724015""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

645177a46843ce0c94c4d48bc9b10a886656c95f,The modulation of endothelial cell gene expression by green tea polyphenol-EGCG.,"Human and animal studies have shown that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of some cancers. This has been attributed to its polyphenol components, in particular (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). In addition to be a cancer chemopreventive agent, EGCG inhibits angiogenesis, thus reducing tumor growth and metastasis. We tested EGCG modulation on the gene expression profile of endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF using Affymetrix microarrays. A total of 421 genes were up-regulated and 72 genes were down-regulated at the false discovery rate of 5% by VEGF, EGCG, and EGCG pretreatment followed by VEGF stimulation. The changes in the expression of several pivotal genes were validated by real-time PCR. Furthermore, we have identified two signaling pathways (Wnt and Id) involved in cell proliferation were inhibited by EGCG treatment, suggesting the negative regulation of EGCG on cell proliferation.

5ad8fe48ac086bfe95b8cd887c5aeb1e50354345,22 Transcriptomic Signatures Of Tendon Ageing,"Introduction Ageing represents a huge challenge for society as whilst lifespan increases the quality of life is often poor, in part due to a progressive loss of mobility. Alterations in tendon properties contribute to muscle weakness and thus reduced mobility in old age as well as an increased risk of injury. The cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these changes in tendons are not understood but are generally considered to result from a failure of cell metabolism and proteostasis. RNA-Seq has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for gene expression profiling in ageing tissues 1 with a greater dynamic range than microarrays and the ability to detect non-coding RNAs. Therefore we undertook an RNA-Seq experiment on young and old human Achilles to characterise molecular mechanisms associated with age-related changes in gene signatures. Methods RNA was extracted from young (n = 4) and old (n = 5) macroscopically normal Achilles tendons collected from amputated limbs with appropriate ethical approval. Ribosomal RNA depleted samples were used for RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and 100bp paired-end reads. The Bioconductor package edgeR was used to identify differential gene expression (DGE) and genes deemed differentially expressed between age groups with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate corrected P-value 2 fold change â‰¥ 1.4. Splice variant analysis was undertaken using a number of software packages in R. Gene ontology investigations were undertaken using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results Analysis identified 42,830 genes expressed in tendon. In total, the expression of 325 transcribed elements including protein-coding transcripts and non-coding transcripts; small non-coding RNAs, pseudogenes, long non-coding RNAs and a single microRNA was significantly different in old compared to young tendon (Â±1.4 log 2 fold change, p Discussion This study demonstrates dynamic alterations in RNA with age at numerous genomic levels which indicate changes in the regulation of transcriptional networks. Age-related isoform gene expression changes identified an over-representation of genes with reduced expression relating to the ECM, degradative proteases, cytokines and growth factors in tendon derived from older donors compared with young donors. These results suggest that age related decline in tendon integrity might result from changes in protein chemistry (isoforms) rather than absolute levels of matrix protein and protease expression.

As a major cause of morbidity and mortality among men, prostate cancer is a heterogenous disease, with a vast heterogeneity in the biology of the disease and in clinical outcome. While it often runs an indolent course, local progression or metastasis may eventually develop, even among patients considered ""low risk"" at diagnosis. Therefore, biomarkers that can discriminate aggressive from indolent disease at an early stage would greatly benefit patients. We hypothesized that tissue specimens from early stage prostate cancers may harbor predictive signatures for disease progression.


METHODS
We used a cohort of radical prostatectomy patients with longitudinal follow-up, who had tumors with low grade and stage that revealed no signs of future disease progression at surgery. During the follow-up period, some patients either remained indolent (non-BCR) or progressed to biochemical recurrence (BCR). Total RNA was extracted from tumor, and adjacent normal epithelium of formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Differential gene expression in tumors, and in tumor versus normal tissues between BCR and non-BCR patients were analyzed by NanoString using a customized CodeSet of 151 probes.


RESULTS
After controlling for false discovery rates, we identified a panel of eight genes (ERG, GGT1, HDAC1, KLK2, MYO6, PLA2G7, BICD1 and CACNAID) that distinguished BCR from non-BCR patients. We found a clear association of ERG expression with non-BCR, which was further corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assays.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results identified ERG as the strongest predictor for BCR and showed that potential prognostic prostate cancer biomarkers can be identified from FFPE tumor specimens.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wusheng Yan"", ids = ""6645457""); list(name = ""Muhammad Usman Jamal"", ids = ""37416481""); list(name = ""Shyh-Han Tan"", ids = ""7474850""); list(name = ""Yingjie Song"", ids = ""2848946""); list(name = ""Denise Young"", ids = ""5438610""); list(name = ""Yongmei Chen"", ids = ""103218819""); list(name = ""Shilpa Katta"", ids = ""3693932""); list(name = ""Kai Ying"", ids = ""40221580""); list(name = ""Lakshmi Ravindranath"", ids = ""49413372""); list(name = ""Tarah Woodle"", ids = ""118114055""); list(name = ""Indu Kohaar"", ids = ""46960038""); list(name = ""Jennifer Cullen"", ids = ""38354471""); list(name = ""Jacob A.

f462cabdd77694e43359c9d5ac0e8660dcd5afbf,Using Alpha Wisely: Improving Power to Detect Multiple QTL,"The increase in the number of available markers for many experimental populations has led to QTL studies with ever increasing marker numbers and densities. The resulting conundrum is that as marker density increases, so does the multiple testing problem. It is important to re-examine the detection of multiple QTL in light of increasing marker density. We explore through simulation whether existing methods have achieved the maximum possible power for detecting multiple QTL and whether increasing the marker density is an effective strategy for locating multiple QTL. In addition to existing methods, such as the maximum, the CET, and the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli procedures, we propose and evaluate the complete set of order statistics with their corresponding empirical joint distribution. We examine these statistics in conjunction with a novel application of the alpha-spending approach, providing a less conservative solution to the problem of controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple tests. We conducted a simulation study to assess the relative power of these approaches as well as their ability to control FDR. We find that several of the new approaches have a reasonable FDR, and can substantially improve the experimenter's ability to detect multiple QTL compared to existing approaches in many cases; however, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure remains a very reasonable choice. The methods are applied to a nine-trait Oat vernalization dataset.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""L SimonsenKaty"", ids = ""103069774""); list(name = ""M McIntyreLauren"", ids = ""102419055"")",1a13f1a22d106e118f54da122ff0f95b21b74a4d; 43a52d94c073d06f3883d6418e8bd480cebd876b; c9181363f37bbd5b20221c3acd58e73147f6c2c8; e695356304426989134d4705cf3faa52eab48c9b; c8fbbe1b107ab08e139bc5c509631a68df9dde85; e2bff19225be31650c4f54c17d36c6317237dd2a,,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,3,1-26

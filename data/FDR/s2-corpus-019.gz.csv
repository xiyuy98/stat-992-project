Despite of their potential importance, understanding of cognitive impairment in COPD remains incomplete. Also, there is no proper diagnostic tool for the early detection of neurologic decline in COPD patients. The correlation between the cognition function and cerebral perfusion function of COPD patients by using brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated that regional perfusion can be altered in COPD patients (2, 3). Brain CBF imaging can be used to map perfusion reserve in brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to evaluate the microstructural change of white matter in vivo. The purpose of this study was to evaluate regional microstructural and perfusion changes in subjects with COPD, by comparing with cognitively normal (CN) elderly controls by using voxelbased morphometry (VBM) analyses of 3D T1WI, DTI indices, and CBF maps. Materials and Methods: The subjects were classified in three groups: moderate COPD groups, severe COPD groups and normal control. Six subjects with severe COPD (6 men, mean age, 69.80 years), 13 with moderate COPD (12 men, 1 women; mean age, 65.23 years), and 12 CN subjects (12 men, mean age, 63.92 years) were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference of demographic characteristics among groups. All patients and controls underwent a standard neuropsychologic test. MR imaging was performed on a 3.0-T MR system (Achieva, Philips Medical system, Best, The Netherlands). For volumetric analysis, the isometric sagittal structural volumetric T1-weighted (T1W) images were acquired. In addition, T2-weighted axial images and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) axial images were also acquired to evaluate any pathological changes. For DTI data, a single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence was used with voxel = 2.2 Ã— 2.2 Ã— 2.2 mm; b = 0 and 800 sec/mm applied along 32 diffusion-encoding directions. For CBF data, STAR arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique was used. All processing steps were performed with using Statistical Parametric Mapping program version 5 (SPM5, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Group comparisons were performed with analysis of covariance (one-way ANOVA) for the GM volumes, FA and trace, and CBF with covarying for subjectâ€™s age. We used multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% with a threshold looking for clusters with at least 10 contiguous voxels for all maps. Results : For the 3D T1WI, GM volumes did not present any significant regional difference among the three groups. For the DTI index of FA, FA in moderate COPD group reduced mainly both frontal cortices, right occipital subcortical white matter, and left angular gyrus compared with CN. Also, FA in severe COPD significantly decreased FA values in gray matter of brain as well as white matter. Finally, FA in severe COPD reduced in bilateral medial temporal cortices, frontal subcortical white matter, occipitofrontal fasciculus, and corticospinal tract compared with moderate COPD. For the DTI index of trace, the trace value in moderate COPD was significantly higher in bilateral occipital cortices, left hippocampus and left superior frontal cortex than the CN group. Also, trace in severe COPD significantly increased in frontal, temporal and occipital lobes, frontal subcortical white matter, occipitofrontal fasciculus, and corticospinal tract. Finally, trace in severe COPD was significantly high in multiple brain regions compared with moderate COPD. For the CBF data, sever COPD patients had decreased CBF in lentiform nucleus compared with CN and moderate COPD. Discussions: The main finding of this study was significant change of axonal integrity in multiple brain regions in COPD. Severe COPD showed extensive regions with significantly lower FA and higher trace in gray and white matter than control groups. Although there have been many neuropsychologic evaluations for COPD patients, little is known of structural change of the brain in COPD patients. A previous study of VBM analysis between COPD and control groups presented significant gray matter losses in the left intraparietal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia and the right inferior frontal gyrus (4). In contrast to previous study, our results did not show any difference of regional brain volume between COPD and control groups. Based on cerebral perfusion measures using brain SPECT, it was suggested that the decrease of the cerebral perfusion in bilateral anterior frontal, left middle frontal and left parietal of COPD might resulted in cognition impairment (2). We only found decreased CBF in severe COPD at lentiform nucleus, lateral globus pallidus. COPD could affect the diffusion and perfusion changes in brain. Conclusion: Regional microstructural changes of brain in COPD were confirmed by using VBM analysis of DTI data for the first time. The result of this study presented the severity of COPD and the cognitive function might be correlated with the extent of microstructural change in brain. Voxel-based evaluation by DTI and CBF may be useful for preclinical detections of the cognitive dysfunction in patients with COPD.

00dd613e7585a67191197c25d6d6a0c83d2d0aef,A note on estimating the false discovery rate under mixture model,"Abstract In this note, we focus on estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of a multiple testing method with a common, non-random rejection threshold under a mixture model. We develop a new class of estimates of the FDR and prove that it is less conservatively biased than what is traditionally used. Numerical evidence is presented to show that the mean squared error (MSE) is also often smaller for the present class of estimates, especially in small-scale multiple testings. A similar class of estimates of the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) less conservatively biased than what is usually used is then proposed. When modified using our estimate of the pFDR and applied to a gene-expression data, Storey's q-value method identifies a few more significant genes than his original q-value method at certain thresholds. The BH like method developed by thresholding our estimate of the FDR is shown to control the FDR in situations where the p-values have the same dependence structure as required by the BH method and, for lack of information about the proportion Ï€ 0 of true null hypotheses, it is reasonable to assume that Ï€ 0 is uniformly distributed over (0,1).",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Fang ai Liu"", ids = ""91537802""); list(name = ""Sanat K.

Reliable biomarkers for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) would be beneficial in the early prevention of adverse metabolic outcomes during pregnancy and beyond.


OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to investigate whether the early pregnancy serum metabolic profile differs in women developing GDM from those remaining healthy. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential of these metabolites to act as predictive markers for GDM.


METHODS
This was a prospective study investigating overweight and obese [prepregnancy BMI (in kg/m2) â‰¥25 and >30, respectively] pregnant women (prepregnancy median BMI: 28.5; IQR: 26.4-31.5; nÂ =Â 357). Fasting serum samples were analyzed with a targeted NMR approach in early pregnancy (median: 14.3 weeks of gestation). GDM was diagnosed on the basis of a 2-h, 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test at a median of 25.7 weeks of gestation.


RESULTS
In early pregnancy, 78 lipid metabolites differed in women who later developed GDM (nÂ =Â 82) compared with those who remained healthy (nÂ =Â 275) (ANCOVA, adjusted for confounding factors and corrected for multiple comparisons; false discovery rateÂ <0.05). Higher concentrations of several-sized VLDL particles and medium- and small-sized HDL particles, and lower concentrations of very large-sized HDL particles, were detected in women developing GDM. Furthermore, concentrations of amino acids including 2 branched-chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, and GlycA, a marker for low-grade inflammation, were higher in women who developed GDM. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the most predictive marker for GDM was a higher concentration of small-sized HDL particles (AUC: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.77; PÂ <Â 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
We identified a distinct early pregnancy metabolomic profile especially attributable to small HDL particles in women developing GDM. The aberrant metabolic profile could represent a novel way to allow early identification of this most common medical condition affecting pregnant women.

82ca4ab1db887a58e01e1b994c9f38db0eeb31a5,Adapting BH to One- and Two-Way Classified Structures of Hypotheses,"Multiple testing literature contains ample research on controlling false discoveries for hypotheses classified according to one criterion, which we refer to as one-way classified hypotheses. Although simultaneous classification of hypotheses according to two different criteria, resulting in two-way classified hypotheses, do often occur in scientific studies, no such research has taken place yet, as far as we know, under this structure. This article produces procedures, both in their oracle and data-adaptive forms, for controlling the overall false discovery rate (FDR) across all hypotheses effectively capturing the underlying one- or two-way classification structure. They have been obtained by using results associated with weighted Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure in their more general forms providing guidance on how to adapt the original BH procedure to the underlying one- or two-way classification structure through an appropriate choice of the weights. The FDR is maintained non-asymptotically by our proposed procedures in their oracle forms under positive regression dependence on subset of null $p$-values (PRDS) and in their data-adaptive forms under independence of the $p$-values. Possible control of FDR for our data-adaptive procedures in certain scenarios involving dependent $p$-values have been investigated through simulations. The fact that our suggested procedures can be superior to contemporary practices has been demonstrated through their applications in simulated scenarios and to real-life data sets. While the procedures proposed here for two-way classified hypotheses are new, the data-adaptive procedure obtained for one-way classified hypotheses is alternative to and often more powerful than those proposed in Hu et al. (2010).",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shinjini Nandi"", ids = ""20962975""); list(name = ""Sanat K.

daf8ebed8b037b104b8cd36a878dde8da31c6bc5,Testing significance relative to a fold-change threshold is a TREAT,"MOTIVATION
Statistical methods are used to test for the differential expression of genes in microarray experiments. The most widely used methods successfully test whether the true differential expression is different from zero, but give no assurance that the differences found are large enough to be biologically meaningful.


RESULTS
We present a method, t-tests relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant genes.

820231fea47e6478031e6f7011abedd5cf3f521c,Expanding the detectable HLA peptide repertoire using electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD).,"The identification of peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I is tremendously important for the understanding of antigen presentation mechanisms under healthy or diseased conditions. Currently, mass spectrometry-based methods represent the best methodology for the identification of HLA class I-associated peptides. However, the HLA class I peptide repertoire remains largely unexplored because the variable nature of endogenous peptides represents difficulties in conventional peptide fragmentation technology. Here, we substantially enhanced (about threefold) the identification success rate of peptides presented by HLA class I using combined electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD), reporting over 12,000 high-confident (false discovery rate <1%) peptides from a single human B-cell line. The direct importance of such an unprecedented large dataset is highlighted by the discovery of unique features in antigen presentation. The observation that a substantial part of proteins is sampled across different HLA alleles, and the common occurrence of HLA class I nested sets, suggest that the constraints of HLA class I to comprehensively present the health states of cells are not as tight as previously thought. Our dataset contains a substantial set of peptides bearing a variety of posttranslational modifications presented with marked allele-specific differences. We propose that EThcD should become the method of choice in analyzing HLA class I-presented peptides.",2014,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Geert P. M.

08b4df95d0f35f4b5a41a5c34ce3e543fccf5897,Detection of cardiac allograft rejection and response to immunosuppressive therapy with peripheral blood gene expression.,"BACKGROUND
Assessment of gene expression in peripheral blood may provide a noninvasive screening test for allograft rejection. We hypothesized that changes in peripheral blood expression profiles would correlate with biopsy-proven rejection and would resolve after treatment of rejection episodes.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We performed a case-control study nested within a cohort of 189 cardiac transplant patients who had blood samples obtained during endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Using Affymetrix HU133A microarrays, we analyzed whole-blood expression profiles from 3 groups: (1) control samples with negative EMB (n=7); (2) samples obtained during rejection (at least International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade 3A; n=7); and (3) samples obtained after rejection, after treatment and normalization of the EMB (n=7). We identified 91 transcripts differentially expressed in rejection compared with control (false discovery rate <0.10). In postrejection samples, 98% of transcripts returned toward control levels, displaying an intermediate expression profile for patients with treated rejection (P<0.0001). Cluster analysis of the 40 transcripts with >25% change in expression levels during rejection demonstrated good discrimination between control and rejection samples and verified the intermediate expression profile of postrejection samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed significant differential expression for the predictive markers CFLAR and SOD2 (UniGene ID No. 355724 and No. 384944).


CONCLUSIONS
These data demonstrate that peripheral blood expression profiles correlate with biopsy-proven allograft rejection. Intermediate expression profiles of treated rejection suggest persistent immune activation despite normalization of the EMB. If validated in larger studies, expression profiling may prove to be a more sensitive screening test for allograft rejection than EMB.",2004,Medicine,"list(name = ""Phillip A.

0863b2ae40ca9ed3180a9e68f612cefe719252aa,Targeted sequencing of genome wide significant loci associated with bone mineral density (BMD) reveals significant novel and rare variants: the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) targeted sequencing study.,"Background
Bone mineral density (BMD) is a heritable phenotype that predicts fracture risk. We performed fine-mapping by targeted sequencing at WLS, MEF2C, ARHGAP1/F2 and JAG1 loci prioritized by eQTL and bioinformatic approaches among 56 BMD loci from our previous GWAS meta-analysis. Targeted sequencing was conducted in 1,291 Caucasians from the Framingham Heart Study ( nâ€‰= â€‰925) and Cardiovascular Health Study ( nâ€‰= â€‰366), including 206 women and men with extreme low femoral neck (FN) BMD. A total of 4,964 sequence variants (SNVs) were observed and 80% were rare with MAFâ€‰<1%. The associations between previously identified SNPs in these loci and BMD, while nominally significant in sequenced participants, were no longer significant after multiple testing corrections. Conditional analyses did not find protein-coding variants that may be responsible for GWAS signals. On the other hand, in the sequenced subjects, we identified novel associations in WLS , ARHGAP1 , and 5' of MEF2C ( P- valuesâ€‰<â€‰8x10â€‰ - â€‰ 5 ; false discovery rate (FDR) q-valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.01) that were much more strongly associated with BMD compared to the GWAS SNPs. These associated SNVs are less-common; independent from previous GWAS signals in the same loci; and located in gene regulatory elements. Our findings suggest that protein-coding variants in selected GWAS loci did not contribute to GWAS signals.

f7ef2f402912ca1d36e9e6be75111070d2ba1a12,Proteomic comparison of colorectal tumours and non-neoplastic mucosa from paired patient samples using iTRAQ mass spectrometry.,"Quantitative mass spectrometry using iTRAQ was used to identify differentially expressed proteins from 16 colorectal cancer (CRC) tumours compared to patient-paired adjacent normal mucosa. Over 1400 proteins were identified and quantitated, with 118 determined as differentially expressed by >1.3-fold, with false discovery rate < 0.05. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that proteins with increased expression levels in CRC tumours include those associated with glycolysis, calcium binding, and protease inhibition. Proteins with reduced levels in CRC tumours were associated with loss of ATP production through: (i) reduced Î²-oxidation of fatty acids, (ii) reduced NADH production by the tricarboxylic acid cycle and (iii) decreased oxidative phosphorylation activity. Additionally, biosyntheses of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans were significantly reduced in tumour samples. Validation experiments using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed strong concordance with iTRAQ data suggesting that this workflow is suitable for identifying biomarker candidates.

b63f7defbbbe176c0574708ef011725765a9020e,Aggregating Knockoffs for Controlling the False Discovery Rate with One-Shot Communication,"We introduce a new method for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)---the expected fraction of spurious discoveries among all the discoveries---in the context of decentralized linear models. Our method targets the scenario where many research groups---possibly the number of which is random---are independently testing a common set of hypotheses and then sending summary statistics to a coordinating center in an online manner. Based on the knockoffs framework introduced by Barber and Cand\`es (2014), our procedure starts by applying the knockoff filter to each linear model and then aggregates the summary statistics via one-shot communication in a novel way. This method gives exact FDR control non-asymptotically without any knowledge of the noise variances or making any assumption about sparsity of the signal. In certain settings, it has a communication complexity that is optimal up to a logarithmic factor.",2015,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Weijie J.

9a9d7e4ba356f81b630dbecbb8c61c849ed2e6f0,A concept-wide association study to identify potential risk factors for nonadherence among prevalent users of antihypertensives.,"PURPOSE
We sought to determine whether an association study using information contained in clinical notes could identify known and potentially novel risk factors for nonadherence to antihypertensive medications.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective concept-wide association study (CWAS) using clinical notes to identify potential risk factors for medication nonadherence, adjusting for age, sex, race, baseline blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and a combined comorbidity score. Participants included Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older receiving care at the Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates network from 2010-2012 and enrolled in a Medicare Advantage program. Concepts were extracted from clinical notes in the year prior to the index prescription date for each patient. We tested associations with the outcome for 5013 concepts extracted from clinical notes in a derivation cohort (4382 patients) and accounted for multiple hypothesis testing by using a false discovery rate threshold of less than 5% (q < .05). We then confirmed the associations in a validation cohort (3836 patients). Medication nonadherence was defined using a proportion of days covered (PDC) threshold less than 0.8 using pharmacy claims data.


RESULTS
We found 415 concepts associated with nonadherence, which we organized into 11 clusters using a hierarchical clustering approach. Volume depletion and overload, assessment of needs at the point of discharge, mood disorders, neurological disorders, complex coordination of care, and documentation of noncompliance were some of the factors associated with nonadherence.


CONCLUSIONS
This approach was successful in identifying previously described and potentially new risk factors for antihypertensive nonadherence using the clinical narrative.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Karandeep Singh"", ids = ""48829479""); list(name = ""Niteesh K Choudhry"", ids = ""4370272""); list(name = ""Alexis A Krumme"", ids = ""2917432""); list(name = ""Caroline Mckay"", ids = ""10182944""); list(name = ""Newell E McElwee"", ids = ""151151750""); list(name = ""Joe Kimura"", ids = ""2534182""); list(name = ""Jessica M.

We have developed a new method for rapid analysis of a specific region on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. This method combines advantages of direct tissue MS analysis keeping histological information and conventional proteomics approaches for confident identification of proteins in complex sample.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
After histological annotation, heat-induced antigen retrieval is performed on FFPE tissue. Using a chemical inkjet printer, trypsin is deposited on discrete regions of less than 1 mmÂ². After protein digestion, a liquid extraction is performed to retrieve all the peptides. Data coming from identification of proteins in cancer and benign region are compared.


RESULTS
In total, 3649 unique peptides were identified (with a peptide strict false discovery rate less than 1%) corresponding to 983 and 792 nonredundant protein groups identified in benign and cancer region, respectively. A total of 123 protein groups are found only in cancer region and 315 are specific to the benign part. From these data, it has been possible to obtain different important signaling pathways involved in cancer processes and some proteins already known as biomarkers.


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
This new approach using a combination of localized on-tissue protein digestion and liquid microextraction followed by LC-MS/MS analysis is useful for advancing our understanding of cancer biology. It is a rapid and innovative technique that will contribute positively to clinical proteomics.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Maxence Wisztorski"", ids = ""7004716""); list(name = ""Benoit Fatou"", ids = ""4139238""); list(name = ""Julien Franck"", ids = ""2010978""); list(name = ""Annie Desmons"", ids = ""40380668""); list(name = ""Isabelle FarrÃ©"", ids = ""145093562""); list(name = ""Eric Leblanc"", ids = ""145261963""); list(name = ""Isabelle Fournier"", ids = ""2107116""); list(name = ""Michel Salzet"", ids = ""5858132"")",ad34357e102484e3e50449e4ffc648dc643a17df; 22e61ceb0d670828c52f0a5960be80760ba35604; b71090816b33849e0f16b39f00308953362771fe; 0fdbeda3ac74c4d5f751edf44b4104deee85f597; 188cf21caaec19136265d51480dff8ec66378df2; e28786d5fc6efb7ac651e03a005dec53108fcea9; 2091314257236c0616c18501f628cee89586d00f; df66ce4c3b0e99604a0cf900385548def2a012a0; 2bef79fd766b9e477b2a938a75ac83518bc62312; d47d5f5070c2cc8eb0f0c48c890a4e9889e5db96; 00db5db7fcb13e41e90d89d6981580a512e0e1cf; be6a33430248965bf3b23d1d7152e3c19a2ac54e; 742cfd29d5114438e3e8039be7f9564b699281c7; 9422785270333b399b5b7d760a7b0b398c6ebc5f; 9fb1a2c80a8f87707c06ae962f087d89c09d5063; d96302f12b4325eb1d0acde3b80a85d27ba04dc3; fa01de43f4e065303922214ef7f8219f94d9d90e; 6ef57416c1161b9ba8b4322972185c787b12be1a; 8585fece6d23b8a8a9c79162f77cbd3df037cf13; b7053987e89602b083fa4f759d58e86780029937,eb3f55e782910e74355d6099adba5778bc69ce2c; 7324dee807d73c6fe5cf0d8fb72bd55344d021a8; e46417b28d3c7541041a7272d1a559dc9f93ad6c; f301cb62fbf07a963f548bc4a738873d93402852; 58a35f323c4d19d940dd670dcdb39b93cd366873; 239a3b7bf0ebaede81332e8a452dda8ebae577af; 952e553863d8633bf4d7f16c37d1e673d7ee5d32; 968cac539079c754e97caff2a90ad06633ddedff; 4b7c9d4aea8dac82e8f087f2677f1ef400aa15e3; 1dc75c50cdc173d98dd5c89cbbb8fc20221045f8; b096eb53318c5bf0213f57600876ebac93ded595; 966287bb49ded099247582b75b732779e3a44f66; fcbc708acae9b236512b6929210f4326c5f08824; 056de3df94b8de338695b02fff8136b96aa77f0e; fb379fde35af69d60f3684ad465b6682ecc992fe; 8ebe35474c59710e311d4eee901ce2c293cb6d93; 16bc7f36737e5d2514cbc855a4cf6173384c3a3e; ceee6447b291f8052a28c9eb00ca360d6f39f9b1; 9bf799a866acfbde3219950d2e47dba284dbe4d9; e16b92711095fec231461459bb02f9516a2792ac; e1aee8377523264974917829dda5753a9ed693e6; e1890fe1b67a6e47b6b21016870f0fce20960ea3; ea2e99b71547b64bfa0964a6051fdd5729698538; b461751452e6b4bb6de8786953a77d1e891fe75b; 0b0312fdb90bf5d82732eec77bf7b3b1175df29b; 3ed27b6801c53cfdac2289413a47ba8f0a1a9f17,Proteomics.

67d30b35d28c81e45bea84b60561caf363faff5d,An adaptive single-step FDR procedure with applications to DNA microarray analysis.,"The use of multiple hypothesis testing procedures has been receiving a lot of attention recently by statisticians in DNA microarray analysis. The traditional FWER controlling procedures are not very useful in this situation since the experiments are exploratory by nature and researchers are more interested in controlling the rate of false positives rather than controlling the probability of making a single erroneous decision. This has led to increased use of FDR (False Discovery Rate) controlling procedures. Genovese and Wasserman proposed a single-step FDR procedure that is an asymptotic approximation to the original Benjamini and Hochberg stepwise procedure. In this paper, we modify the Genovese-Wasserman procedure to force the FDR control closer to the level alpha in the independence setting. Assuming that the data comes from a mixture of two normals, we also propose to make this procedure adaptive by first estimating the parameters using the EM algorithm and then using these estimated parameters into the above modification of the Genovese-Wasserman procedure. We compare this procedure with the original Benjamini-Hochberg and the SAM thresholding procedures. The FDR control and other properties of this adaptive procedure are verified numerically.",2007,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vishwanath Iyer"", ids = ""50487239""); list(name = ""Sanat K.

ee3e0250903a61b118851687259aa69aebbff6da,Resistant and susceptible chicken lines show distinctive responses to Newcastle disease virus infection in the lung transcriptome,"BackgroundNewcastle disease virus (NDV) is a threat to poultry production worldwide. A better understanding of mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility to this virus will improve measures for NDV prevention and control. Males and females from resistant Fayoumi and susceptible Leghorn lines were either challenged with a lentogenic strain of the virus or given a mock infection at 3 weeks of age. The lung transcriptomes generated by RNA-seq were studied using contrasts across the challenged and nonchallenged birds, the two lines, and three time points post-infection, and by using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGNCA).ResultsGenetic line and sex had a large impact on the lung transcriptome. When contrasting the challenged and nonchallenged birds, few differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified within each line at 2, 6, and 10Â days post infection (dpi), except for the more resistant Fayoumi line at 10 dpi, for which several pathways were activated and inhibited at this time. The interaction of challenge and line at 10 dpi significantly impacted 131 genes (False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.05), one of which was PPIB. Many DEG were identified between the Fayoumi and Leghorns. The number of DEG between the two lines in the challenged birds decreased over time, but increased over time in the nonchallenged birds. The nonchallenged Fayoumis at 10 dpi showed enrichment of immune type cells when compared to 2 dpi, suggesting important immune related development at this age. These changes between 10 and 2 dpi were not identified in the challenged Fayoumis. The energy allocated to host defense may have interrupted normal lung development. WGCNA identified important modules and driver genes within those modules that were associated with traits of interest, several of which had no known associated function.ConclusionsThe linesâ€™ unique response to NDV offers insights into the potential means of their resistance and susceptibility. The lung transcriptome shows a unique response to lentogenic NDV compared to a previous study on the trachea of the same birds.

841998f8e4a16c0ef70e39d506cb9956fb7eb34c,Genome-wide geneâ€“environment interaction analysis for asbestos exposure in lung cancer susceptibility,"Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted genome-wide gene-environment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was 2.17Ã—10(-6), which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90Ã—10(-5)). Interestingly, most of the other significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sheng Cheng Wei"", ids = ""11700048""); list(name = ""Li-e Wang"", ids = ""46659192""); list(name = ""Michelle K.

Methods: Lung function of 25 adults with CF hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation was reported as a % of the predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%). Plasma was analyzed via high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LTQ-Velos Orbitrap). An in-house R package performed linear regression with false discovery rate (FDR) correction to explore associations between clinical variables and plasma metabolites (q=0.20). The pathway analysis program, Mummichog, was used to match metabolites (p<0.05) to known metabolic pathways. Results: Of the 14,948 metabolites detected, FEV1% and LOS were associated with 41 and 99 metabolites, respectively (q<0.20). BMI was not associa...",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Ellen M.

SCN penetrates the root and migrates toward the central vascular bundle where it establishes a complex multinucleated feeding structure that provides plant-derived nutrients to support the development and growth of the nematode. To identify host genes that play significant roles in SCN development in susceptible roots, RNA from SCN-inoculated and non-inoculated root pieces were hybridized to the Affymetrix soybean genome GeneChips. RNA was collected at 8, 12, and 16 d post-inoculation from root pieces that displayed multiple swollen female SCN and similar root pieces from non-inoculated roots. Branch roots and root tips were trimmed from the root pieces to minimize the amount of RNA contributed by these organs. Of the 35 593 transcripts represented on the GeneChip, approximately 26,500 were expressed in the SCN-colonized root pieces. ANOVA followed by False Discovery Rate analysis indicated that the expression levels of 4616 transcripts changed significantly (Q-value < or =0.05) in response to SCN. In this set of 4616 transcripts, 1404 transcripts increased >2-fold and 739 decreased >2-fold. Of the transcripts to which a function could be assigned, a large proportion was associated with cell wall structure.

600e63a0bfeb6e99ec72526d85bd08b9c2d12391,Schizotypy-related magnetization of cortex in healthy adolescence is co-located with expression of schizophrenia-related genes,"BACKGROUND
Genetic risk is thought to drive clinical variation on a spectrum of schizophrenia-like traits, but the underlying changes in brain structure that mechanistically link genomic variation to schizotypal experience and behavior are unclear.


METHODS
We assessed schizotypy using a self-reported questionnaire and measured magnetization transfer as a putative microstructural magnetic resonance imaging marker of intracortical myelination in 68 brain regions in 248 healthy young people (14-25 years of age). We used normative adult brain gene expression data and partial least squares analysis to find the weighted gene expression pattern that was most colocated with the cortical map of schizotypy-related magnetization.


RESULTS
Magnetization was significantly correlated with schizotypy in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (and for disorganized schizotypy, also in medial prefrontal cortex; all false discovery rate-corrected psÂ <Â .05), which are regions of the default mode network specialized for social and memory functions. The genes most positively weighted on the whole-genome expression map colocated with schizotypy-related magnetization were enriched for genes that were significantly downregulated in two prior case-control histological studies of brain gene expression in schizophrenia. Conversely, the most negatively weighted genes were enriched for genes that were transcriptionally upregulated in schizophrenia. Positively weighted (downregulated) genes were enriched for neuronal, specifically interneuronal, affiliations and coded a network of proteins comprising a few highly interactive ""hubs"" such as parvalbumin and calmodulin.


CONCLUSIONS
Microstructural magnetic resonance imaging maps of intracortical magnetization can be linked to both the behavioral traits of schizotypy and prior histological data on dysregulated gene expression in schizophrenia.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rafael Romero-Garcia"", ids = ""1422139658""); list(name = ""Jakob Seidlitz"", ids = ""4504722""); list(name = ""Kirstie J.

35da8502ebfb90a9fe6cd2dc276bd49dc3c610aa,Mapping the bacterial ecology on the phyllosphere of grass hay and the potential hazards of soaking fodder for horse gut health,"Globally hay is the preferred forage for stabled horses. Variable nutritional and hygienic quality stimulates pre-feeding soaking to reduce dust and nutrients to reduce respiratory and metabolic disorders in horses. However, this practice has potential negative impacts on horse health. The objectives of this study were to map the bacterial profile of different hays and determine how soaking alters this with the aim of recommending best practice when feeding fodder to stabled horses. Two meadow and one Perennial Ryegrass hays were soaked for 0, 1.5, 9 or 16 hours. Post treatment, hays were analysed for water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) and total aerobic bacteria (TVC), with differences determined using ANOVA and least significant difference. Bacteria were identified via genomic DNA extraction (V3 and V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene) and 16S library preparation according to the Illumina protocol. Differences in phyla and family operational taxonomic units within hay types were identified via paired t-tests on the DESeq2 normalised data and false discovery rates accounted for using Padj (P<0.05). Mean WSC losses g/kg DM (+/-SE) increased with soaking time being 30 (10.7), 72 (43.7), 80 (38.8) for 1.5, 9 and 16 hours soak respectively. No relationship existed between WSC leaching and bacteria content or profile. Grass type influenced bacterial profiles. Soaking altered the epiphytic bacterial profile across all hays and 9 hours soaking increased richness and Shannon diversity indices. Clustering of bacteria was seen between meadow hays which differed from perennial rye grass and this difference increased post soaking. The normal industry practice of soaking hay for 9 hours pre-feeding cannot be recommended as it increases total bacteria content with noted increases of some potential pathogens. The alterations in bacteria profile and hygienic quality may explain why changing fodder or pre-feeding treatments can frequently precipitate colic in horses.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Meriel Js Moore-Colyer"", ids = ""1403753240""); list(name = ""Annette C.

a9b0cc5f740d0897e3b4292adbbc42b5b5fc095a,Complete and integrated pyrene degradation pathway in Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 based on systems biology.,"Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 was the first bacterium isolated by virtue of its ability to metabolize the high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pyrene. We used metabolic, genomic, and proteomic approaches in this investigation to construct a complete and integrated pyrene degradation pathway for M. vanbaalenii PYR-1. Genome sequence analyses identified genes involved in the pyrene degradation pathway that we have proposed for this bacterium. To identify proteins involved in the degradation, we conducted a proteome analysis of cells exposed to pyrene using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Database searching performed with the M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 genome resulted in identification of 1,028 proteins with a protein false discovery rate of <1%. Based on both genomic and proteomic data, we identified 27 enzymes necessary for constructing a complete pathway for pyrene degradation. Our analyses indicate that this bacterium degrades pyrene to central intermediates through o-phthalate and the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Proteomic analysis also revealed that 18 enzymes in the pathway were upregulated more than twofold, as indicated by peptide counting when the organism was grown with pyrene; three copies of the terminal subunits of ring-hydroxylating oxygenase (NidAB2, MvanDraft_0817/0818, and PhtAaAb), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (MvanDraft_0815), and ring cleavage dioxygenase (MvanDraft_3242) were detected only in pyrene-grown cells.

43156067d535ba40e975a45dd533f2fec26ed515,Common genetic variants in sex hormone pathway genes and papillary thyroid cancer risk.,"BACKGROUND
Hormonal differences are hypothesized to contribute to the approximately â‰¥2-fold higher thyroid cancer incidence rates among women compared with men worldwide. Although thyroid cancer cells express estrogen receptors and estrogen has a proliferative effect on papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells in vitro, epidemiologic studies have not found clear associations between thyroid cancer and female hormonal factors. We hypothesized that polymorphic variation in hormone pathway genes is associated with the risk of developing papillary thyroid cancer.


METHODS
We evaluated the association between PTC and 1151 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 58 candidate gene regions involved in sex hormone synthesis and metabolism, gonadotropins, and prolactin in a case-control study of 344 PTC cases and 452 controls, frequency matched on age and sex. Odds ratios and p-values for the linear trend for the association between each SNP genotype and PTC risk were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. SNPs in the same gene region or pathway were aggregated using adaptive rank-truncated product methods to obtain gene region-specific or pathway-specific p-values. To account for multiple comparisons, we applied the false discovery rate method.


RESULTS
Seven SNPs had p-values for linear trend <0.01, including four in the CYP19A1 gene, but none of the SNPs remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Results were similar when restricting the dataset to women. p-values for examined gene regions and for all genes combined were â‰¥0.09.


CONCLUSIONS
Based on these results, SNPs in selected hormone pathway genes do not appear to be strongly related to PTC risk. This observation is in accord with the lack of consistent associations between hormonal factors and PTC risk in epidemiologic studies.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sara J.

6e2af54c2e6b0146da72c7d2f70accc7a100f154,Th17 gene expression in psoriatic arthritis synovial fluid and peripheral blood compared to osteoarthritis and cutaneous psoriasis.,"OBJECTIVES
The IL-23/IL-17 axis is central to the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We aimed to identify Th17 signalling genes that are dysregulated in synovial fluid of PsA compared to osteoarthritis (OA) patients and to determine if differences in peripheral blood can distinguish PsA from psoriasis patients and controls.


METHODS
Synovial fluid cells (SFCs) from 14 PsA and 9 OA patients were obtained and stored in TRIzol reagent. RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and purified with RNeasy miniprep kits. Total RNA was extracted from PAXgene whole blood from 20 PsA, 20 psoriasis without arthritis (PsC) and 11 controls. Quantitative RT-PCR arrays were used to profile expression of 84 genes related to the Th17 regulatory network. Fold change differences were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR<0.05).


RESULTS
In PsA compared to OA SFCs, a total of 33 genes were up-regulated and 27 genes were down-regulated. Signalling molecules (such as STAT3, FOXP3) were highly expressed in PsA SFCs, while cytokines (such as IL17F, IL6) were more predominant in OA SFCs after non-supervised hierarchal clustering. Nine genes (MMP3, CCL1, IL17C, CCL20, IL17F, IL3, CXCL5, IL6 and CX3CL1) had concordant expression in SFCs and in peripheral blood cells (PBCs) of PsA compared to PsC and/or controls.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified expression differences in Th17 signalling genes in PsA compared to OA SFCs, with an elevation of signalling molecules and attenuation of cytokine expression in PsA. A subset of genes was concordant in PBCs; these may thus be potential biomarkers of PsA.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fatima Abji"", ids = ""7435544""); list(name = ""Remy A.

01dbe225214e48cab6d1293e9e318b5c390ee170,Exploring breast carcinogenesis through integrative genomics and epigenomics analyses.,"There have been many DNA methylation studies on breast cancer which showed various methylation patterns involving tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes but only a few of those studies link the methylation data with gene expression. More data are required especially from the Asian region and to analyse how the epigenome data correlate with the transcriptome. DNA methylation profiling was carried out on 76 fresh frozen primary breast tumour tissues and 25 adjacent non-cancerous breast tissues using the Illumina Infinium(Â®) HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. Validation of methylation results was performed on 7 genes using either MS-MLPA or MS-qPCR. Gene expression profiling was done on 15 breast tumours and 5 adjacent non-cancerous breast tissues using the Affymetrix GeneChip(Â®) Human Gene 1.0 ST array. The overlapping genes between DNA methylation and gene expression datasets were further mapped to the KEGG database to identify the molecular pathways that linked these genes together. Supervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed 1,389 hypermethylated CpG sites and 22 hypomethylated CpG sites in cancer compared to the normal samples. Gene expression microarray analysis using a fold-change of at least 1.5 and a false discovery rate (FDR) at p>0.05 identified 404 upregulated and 463 downregulated genes in cancer samples. Integration of both datasets identified 51 genes with hypermethylation with low expression (negative association) and 13 genes with hypermethylation with high expression (positive association). Most of the overlapping genes belong to the focal adhesion and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction that play important roles in breast carcinogenesis.

7a6d88a7949ae0f20ec848e2aa5832ee4100dd74,Population-based local multi-parametric comparisons of HR-pQCT studies,"400 words maximum. Introduction Conventional HR-pQCT quantification approaches average bone features over large regions and ignore their spatial association within the structure, obscuring local information regarding their distribution and how they contribute to bone strength. Here, we present 3D image analysis techniques for population-scale multi-parametric spatial comparisons of bone quality features. Specifically, we present: 1) voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and 2) a surface-based framework to encode cortical bone features in a laminar-wise manner, which is then used to measure cortical bone thickness and perform statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Methods Imaging Scan-rescan HR-pQCT acquisitions with repositioning of the distal radius and tibia were acquired in 30 subjects. VBM The radius and tibia of one subject were selected as references. Bone feature maps of the remaining subjects were homogenized and spatially normalized to the references based on affine and nonlinear registrations. Voxel-wise multi-parametric comparisons (vBMD and BV/TV) were then performed between â€œfollow-upâ€ and â€œbaselineâ€ scans, using Hotelling's T2 tests for dependent samples and false discovery rate correction (FDR). Surface-Based Cortical Bone Analysis Bone segmentations, vBMD maps, non-local means, and fuzzy logic were used to generate soft cortical bone segmentations: [0=marrow, 1=bone]. A one-to-one matching between the periosteal surface and the endosteal boundary was established through streamlines computed with the Laplaceâ€™s equation, thus enabling a laminar analysis. -Streamline Integral Thickness (SIT) Integrals of the soft segmentation along the streamlines yielded a porosity-weighted cortical bone thickness measure. The streamline lengths provided an apparent measure of cortical thickness. -SPM VBM registrations were used to spatially normalize the periosteal surfaces. Analogous to VBM, multi-parametric vertex-wise comparisons of SIT and mean streamline vBMD were performed. -Global Reproducibility Rigid matching of individual â€œfollow-upâ€ and â€œbaselineâ€ surfaces was performed to assess global reproducibility of thickness and mean streamline vBMD using CVRMS (absolute errors). Results Figure-1 shows a spatial normalization example and a mean BV/TV map. Cortical thickness maps of a scan-rescan example, mean cortical thickness maps, and a laminar vBMD example are shown in Figure-2. No significantly different voxels or vertices were found after FDR correction, indicating no significant multi-parametric differences between â€œbaselineâ€ and â€œfollow-upâ€ scans. Global reproducibility yielded CVRMS of 1.6% (0.018mm) and 0.9% (0.013mm) for apparent thickness, 1.5% (0.014mm) and 0.9% (0.010mm) for SIT, and 1.2% (4.68mg/cm3) and 0.8% (3.05mg/cm3) for vBMD, for the radius and tibia, respectively. Conclusions Advanced 3D image analysis techniques may be employed for population-based local multiparametric comparisons of HR-pQCT studies with high reproducibility.

Patient-derived breast xenografts (PDXs) closely mimic the tumor microenvironment including the tumor architecture and interactions among cancer cells and stromal cells. PDXs provide a unique opportunity to study tumor-stroma interactions and the regulation of protein expression in the tumor microenvironment since species-specific amino acid sequences of the tumor (human) can be distinguished from the stroma (mouse) by LC-MS. However, quantitative proteomics workflows usually do not report species-specific peptides. We therefore developed a proteomics workflow based on 10-plex isobaric tagging to quantitatively profile the protein expression of PDXs and their associated microenvironment. Three biological replicates of seven breast cancer PDXs, representing three breast cancer subtypes, were profiled. Selecting only gene- and species-specific peptides for quantification of protein expression, we identified 8,113 human proteins (4,867 genes) and 2,251 mouse proteins (1,763 genes). Surprisingly, hierarchical clustering by mouse protein expression tightly clustered 4 of the 7 PDXs, with each of the 3 biological replicates next to one another. Notably, the 4 tightly clustered PDXs were from tumors with claudin-low, Her2-E and luminal B subtypes, whereas the biological replicates of three basal subtypes in the dataset were not tightly clustered. Gene set enrichment analysis of the stromal protein expression revealed upregulation of MTORC1 signaling, EMT, and interferon gamma response signaling with false discovery rates below 5%. We further investigated expression of signaling proteins in the tumor microenvironment by enriching active kinases with multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads. 152 mouse kinases were identified in the tumor microenvironment many tumor-specific differences in kinase levels. Taken together, our results imply that individual patient-derived breast tumors can actively and consistently orchestrate unique alterations in the proteins expressed in their microenvironment. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our proteomic analysis workflow to delineate tumor-stroma signaling networks in PDXs.

Our previous reports have shown that the H1047R is a gain-of-function mutation that increases colorectal cancer (CRC) cell migration & cancer metastasis. We have also shown that H1047R mutation may increases CRC HCT116 cell migration via actin cytoskeleton reorganization & cell morphology change. The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure which is controlled or mediated by a number of small molecules & actin-binding proteins. The purpose of this study was to determine the differential gene expression profiles in CRC cells with either wild type (WT) or H1047R mutant (MUT) PIK3CA. METHODS: HCT116 cells engineered to contain either MUT or WT PI3KCA allele were used in this study. Total RNA was extracted from the two isogenic cell lines by commercial isolation reagents. RNA sequencing was used to identify the specific alterations in gene expression profiling of the cells. The raw RNA-seq reads were preprocessed through a customized analysis pipeline & summarized to gene level feature counts. The differential expression gene (DEG) analysis was performed using R & Bioconductor packages including edgeR. RESULTS: At significance levels false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05, we identified 89 DEGs whose fold changes (FC) are greater than 2. Among the 89 DEGs, 49 are up-regulated & 40 are down-regulated by H1047R mutation. By GO (Gene Ontology) category pathway analysis, the H1047R mutation mediated gene expression alteration are involved in 26 pathways including cell migration, regulation of cell communication, cell surface receptor signaling pathway, morphogenesis, regulation of signaling & cell-cell signaling pathways. For example, the upregulated VCA (Versican) & EPHA4 (EPH Receptor A4) play important roles in controlling cell migration. CTEN/TNS4 was also upregulated, which localizes to focal adhesions & induces cell motility. On the other hand, the downregulated ARHGAP18 is a coding gene of Rho GTPase Activating Protein 18 which suppresses F-actin polymerization by inhibiting Rho, thereby regulating cell shape, spreading, & migration. CONCLUSION: The H1047R mutation induced specific alterations in gene expression profiling of CRC HCT116 cells have been detected. These changes appear to contribute to more aggressive cancer cell behavior. These results will guide further studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying H1047R-p110Î± mediated CRC metastasis. Understanding these mechanisms may allow for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for patients who bear the H1047R mutation.

2911c2b0f286673ea24e7d7eb064b90724dc6993,Reduced mitochondrial activity in colonocytes facilitates AMPKÎ±2-dependent inflammation.,"Intestinal inflammation is associated with low levels of mucosal ATP, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial function associated with ATP production in the pathophysiology of the disease. In the inflamed colon of humans and mice, we found decreased levels of mitochondrial complex cytochrome c oxidase I/IV and lower ATP levels. Thus, we generated colonic Ï0 cells with reduced mitochondrial function linked to ATP production by selective depletion of mitochondrial DNA. In these cells, RNA sequencing revealed a substantial number of differentially expressed transcripts, among which 240 belonged to inflammatory pathways activated in human inflamed colon and TNF-Î±-treated cells (false discovery rate < 0.05). TNF-Î± treatment of colonic Ï0 cells augmented IL-8 expression by 9-fold (P < 0.01) via NF-ÎºB compared to TNF-Î±-treated control. Moreover, reduced mitochondrial function facilitated TNF-Î±-mediated NF-ÎºB luciferase promoter activity as a result of lowered inhibitory IÎºBÎ± (nuclear factor of Îº light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor, Î±), leading to elevated NF-ÎºB. In cells with reduced mitochondrial function, TNF-Î± facilitated AMPKÎ±2 activation by 8-fold (P < 0.01), which was involved in NF-ÎºB-dependent IL-8 expression. Last, in human and mouse colon, anti-TNF-Î± treatment restored reduced mitochondria-dependent inflammation. We propose that selective targeting of this novel mechanism provides new treatment opportunities for intestinal inflammation.-Heller, S., Penrose, H.

0986d54c699460f848fd57f5a505a0e3e5ac3bdb,Addressing Statistical Biases in Nucleotide-Derived Protein Databases for Proteogenomic Search Strategies,"Proteogenomics has the potential to advance genome annotation through high quality peptide identifications derived from mass spectrometry experiments, which demonstrate a given gene or isoform is expressed and translated at the protein level. This can advance our understanding of genome function, discovering novel genes and gene structure that have not yet been identified or validated. Because of the high-throughput shotgun nature of most proteomics experiments, it is essential to carefully control for false positives and prevent any potential misannotation. A number of statistical procedures to deal with this are in wide use in proteomics, calculating false discovery rate (FDR) and posterior error probability (PEP) values for groups and individual peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). These methods control for multiple testing and exploit decoy databases to estimate statistical significance. Here, we show that database choice has a major effect on these confidence estimates leading to significant differences in the number of PSMs reported. We note that standard target:decoy approaches using six-frame translations of nucleotide sequences, such as assembled transcriptome data, apparently underestimate the confidence assigned to the PSMs. The source of this error stems from the inflated and unusual nature of the six-frame database, where for every target sequence there exists five ""incorrect"" targets that are unlikely to code for protein. The attendant FDR and PEP estimates lead to fewer accepted PSMs at fixed thresholds, and we show that this effect is a product of the database and statistical modeling and not the search engine. A variety of approaches to limit database size and remove noncoding target sequences are examined and discussed in terms of the altered statistical estimates generated and PSMs reported.

0d64cd8f03f5eda75188d5be0374432450c2da3c,Dysfunction of attention switching networks in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"OBJECTIVE
To localise and characterise changes in cognitive networks in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using source analysis of mismatch negativity (MMN) waveforms.


RATIONALE
The MMN waveform has an increased average delay in ALS. MMN has been attributed to change detection and involuntary attention switching. This therefore indicates pathological impairment of the neural network components which generate these functions. Source localisation can mitigate the poor spatial resolution of sensor-level EEG analysis by associating the sensor-level signals to the contributing brain sources. The functional activity in each generating source can therefore be individually measured and investigated as a quantitative biomarker of impairment in ALS or its sub-phenotypes.


METHODS
MMN responses from 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in 58 ALS patients and 39 healthy controls were localised to source by three separate localisation methods, including beamforming, dipole fitting and exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography.


RESULTS
Compared with controls, ALS patients showed significant increase in power of the left posterior parietal, central and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (false discovery rateâ€¯=â€¯0.1). This change correlated with impaired cognitive flexibility (rhoâ€¯=â€¯0.45, 0.45, 0.47, pâ€¯=â€¯.042, .055, .031 respectively). ALS patients also exhibited a decrease in the power of dipoles representing activity in the inferior frontal (left: pâ€¯=â€¯5.16â€¯Ã—â€¯10-6, right: pâ€¯=â€¯1.07â€¯Ã—â€¯10-5) and left superior temporal gyri (pâ€¯=â€¯9.30â€¯Ã—â€¯10-6). These patterns were detected across three source localisation methods. Decrease in right inferior frontal gyrus activity was a good discriminator of ALS patients from controls (AUROCâ€¯=â€¯0.77) and an excellent discriminator of C9ORF72 expansion-positive patients from controls (AUROCâ€¯=â€¯0.95).


INTERPRETATION
Source localization of evoked potentials can reliably discriminate patterns of functional network impairment in ALS and ALS subgroups during involuntary attention switching. The discriminative ability of the detected cognitive changes in specific brain regions are comparable to those of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

6917066c1deab5e341d66eb43260881ce6cf05e0,Abstract LB-161: A population-based assessment of cancer risk among children with non-chromosomal birth defects in 10 million live births,"Purpose: While cancer risk is increased among children with chromosomal birth defects, less is known about associations between specific non-chromosomal structural birth defects and specific childhood cancers. To investigate these, we established a population-based retrospective cohort of >10 million children by pooling statewide registry data from four U.S. states (Texas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Arkansas) for the period 1992-2013. Methods: Individual level data from birth certificates, birth defects registries, and cancer registries were linked in each state; demographic and diagnostic variables were harmonized; and the data were pooled for the overall analysis. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations between 60 birth defects and 31 childhood cancers when there were five or more comorbid cases. A hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each birth defect-childhood cancer (BD-CC) pairwise combination, adjusted for maternal age, infant sex, and state. The false discovery rate (FDR) was computed via the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to account for multiple comparisons. Results: We identified 517,548 children with non-chromosomal structural birth defects and 14,774 children with cancer. The risk of any cancer was increased among children with any non-chromosomal structural defect compared to children without any birth defect (HR=2.6, 95% CI 2.4-2.7). Of 2,511 potential BD-CC combinations, we tested 606 where there were â‰¥5 comorbid cases and identified 496 BD-CC associations with significantly elevated HRs at a 5% FDR. No significant inverse associations were identified for any BD-CC combination. Notably, hepatoblastoma, astrocytoma, ependymoma, and extracranial germ cell tumors were each strongly associated with several birth defects. For example, the risk of hepatoblastoma was increased among children with atrial septal defects (HR=12.5, 95% CI 7.9-19.7) and craniosynostosis (HR=15.4, 95% CI 7.6-31.3). Astrocytoma and ependymoma were associated with central nervous system (CNS) defects (HR=6.7, 95% CI 4.6-9.8 and HR=7.4, 95%CI 3.5-15.7, respectively). Elevated risk of extracranial germ cell tumors was observed among children with CNS defects (HR=22.5, 95% CI 10.9-46.4) and obstructive genitourinary defects (HR=32.4, 95% CI 16.2-64.6). Conclusions: By pooling registry data across four U.S. states, we were able to evaluate specific BD-CC patterns and report several novel associations. Our findings suggest that children with non-chromosomal birth defects have a significantly elevated risk of several childhood cancers. These findings may inform research into the etiologies of childhood cancer, as well as new cancer surveillance protocols for children with non-chromosomal birth defects.

25d2af889f9b3f6ebd9ab38159a27046f59421f3,Identification of a 3â€²â€Untranslated Genetic Variant of RARB Associated With Carotid Intimaâ€Media Thickness in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Genomeâ€Wide Association Study,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate the genetic background influencing the development of cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).


METHODS
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which, after quality control and imputation, a total of 6,308,944 polymorphisms across the whole genome were analyzed in 2,989 RA patients of European origin. Data on subclinical atherosclerosis, obtained through assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and presence/absence of carotid plaques by carotid ultrasonography, were available for 1,355 individuals.


RESULTS
A genetic variant of the RARB gene (rs116199914) was associated with CIMT values at the genome-wide level of significance (minor allele [G] Î² coefficient 0.142, P = 1.86 Ã— 10-8 ). Interestingly, rs116199914 overlapped with regulatory elements in tissues related to CV pathophysiology and immune cells. In addition, biologic pathway enrichment and predictive protein-protein relationship analyses, including suggestive GWAS signals of potential relevance, revealed a functional enrichment of the collagen biosynthesis network related to the presence/absence of carotid plaques (Gene Ontology no. 0032964; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 4.01 Ã— 10-3 ). Furthermore, our data suggest potential influences of the previously described candidate CV risk loci NFKB1, MSRA, and ZC3HC1 (P = 8.12 Ã— 10-4 , P = 5.94 Ã— 10-4 , and P = 2.46 Ã— 10-4 , respectively).

18f6e4ad13af90e464587858ce8754441cebf78c,Evaluation of TRAF6 in a large multiancestral lupus cohort.,"OBJECTIVE
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease with significant immune system aberrations resulting from complex heritable genetics as well as environmental factors. We undertook to study the role of TRAF6 as a candidate gene for SLE, since it plays a major role in several signaling pathways that are important for immunity and organ development.


METHODS
Fifteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across TRAF6 were evaluated in 7,490 SLE patients and 6,780 control subjects from different ancestries. Population-based case-control association analyses and meta-analyses were performed. P values, false discovery rate q values, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated.


RESULTS
Evidence of associations was detected in multiple SNPs. The best overall P values were obtained for SNPs rs5030437 and rs4755453 (P = 7.85 Ã— 10(-5) and P = 4.73 Ã— 10(-5) , respectively) without significant heterogeneity among populations (P = 0.67 and P = 0.50, respectively, in Q statistic). In addition, SNP rs540386, which was previously reported to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with these 2 SNPs (r(2) = 0.95) and demonstrated evidence of association with SLE in the same direction (meta-analysis P = 9.15 Ã— 10(-4) , OR 0.89 [95% CI 0.83-0.95]). The presence of thrombocytopenia improved the overall results in different populations (meta-analysis P = 1.99 Ã— 10(-6) , OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.45-0.72], for rs5030470). Finally, evidence of family-based association in 34 African American pedigrees with the presence of thrombocytopenia was detected in 1 available SNP (rs5030437) with a Z score magnitude of 2.28 (P = 0.02) under a dominant model.


CONCLUSION
Our data indicate the presence of association of TRAF6 with SLE, consistent with the previous report of association with RA. These data provide further support for the involvement of TRAF6 in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bahram Namjou"", ids = ""152235986""); list(name = ""Chan-Bum Choi"", ids = ""80164967""); list(name = ""Isaac T.

0a6a95c9365ab89dbe0af2b4194f58563dd86da0,"Differential Gene Expression in Liver, Gill, and Olfactory Rosettes of Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) After Acclimation to Salinity","Most Pacific salmonids undergo smoltification and transition from freshwater to saltwater, making various adjustments in metabolism, catabolism, osmotic, and ion regulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying this transition are largely unknown. In the present study, we acclimated coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to four different salinities and assessed gene expression through microarray analysis of gills, liver, and olfactory rosettes. Gills are involved in osmotic regulation, liver plays a role in energetics, and olfactory rosettes are involved in behavior. Between all salinity treatments, liver had the highest number of differentially expressed genes at 1616, gills had 1074, and olfactory rosettes had 924, using a 1.5-fold cutoff and a false discovery rate of 0.5. Higher responsiveness of liver to metabolic changes after salinity acclimation to provide energy for other osmoregulatory tissues such as the gills may explain the differences in number of differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes were tissue- and salinity-dependent. There were no known genes differentially expressed that were common to all salinity treatments and all tissues. Gene ontology term analysis revealed biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components that were significantly affected by salinity, a majority of which were tissue-dependent. For liver, oxygen binding and transport terms were highlighted. For gills, muscle, and cytoskeleton-related terms predominated and for olfactory rosettes, immune response-related genes were accentuated. Interaction networks were examined in combination with GO terms and determined similarities between tissues for potential osmosensors, signal transduction cascades, and transcription factors.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lindley A Maryoung"", ids = ""4948396""); list(name = ""Ramon Lavado"", ids = ""92463709""); list(name = ""Theo K.

741e5974c72fe31bca3c01ca506ea062f754ecc7,Adaptation of Decoy Fusion Strategy for Existing Multi-Stage Search Workflows,"AbstractA number of proteomic database search engines implement multi-stage strategies aiming at increasing the sensitivity of proteome analysis. These approaches often employ a subset of the original database for the secondary stage of analysis. However, if target-decoy approach (TDA) is used for false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, the multi-stage strategies may violate the underlying assumption of TDA that false matches are distributed uniformly across the target and decoy databases. This violation occurs if the numbers of target and decoy proteins selected for the second search are not equal. Here, we propose a method of decoy database generation based on the previously reported decoy fusion strategy. This method allows unbiased TDA-based FDR estimation in multi-stage searches and can be easily integrated into existing workflows utilizing popular search engines and post-search algorithms.

7a8c4c7c3331b9ad0fd28cac1161cbe49c676031,Novel gene and gene model detection using a whole genome open reading frame analysis in proteomics,"BackgroundDefining the location of genes and the precise nature of gene products remains a fundamental challenge in genome annotation. Interrogating tandem mass spectrometry data using genomic sequence provides an unbiased method to identify novel translation products. A six-frame translation of the entire human genome was used as the query database to search for novel blood proteins in the data from the Human Proteome Organization Plasma Proteome Project. Because this target database is orders of magnitude larger than the databases traditionally employed in tandem mass spectra analysis, careful attention to significance testing is required. Confidence of identification is assessed using our previously described Poisson statistic, which estimates the significance of multi-peptide identifications incorporating the length of the matching sequence, number of spectra searched and size of the target sequence database.ResultsApplying a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05, we identified 282 significant open reading frames, each containing two or more peptide matches. There were 627 novel peptides associated with these open reading frames that mapped to a unique genomic coordinate placed within the start/stop points of previously annotated genes. These peptides matched 1,110 distinct tandem MS spectra. Peptides fell into four categories based upon where their genomic coordinates placed them relative to annotated exons within the parent gene.ConclusionThis work provides evidence for novel alternative splice variants in many previously annotated genes. These findings suggest that annotation of the genome is not yet complete and that proteomics has the potential to further add to our understanding of gene structures.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Damian Fermin"", ids = ""1923241""); list(name = ""Baxter B.

43858610c6b4a8df50c7b5bfbdad162480cb4c67,A Prototype Knockoff Filter for Group Selection with FDR Control,"In many applications, we need to study a linear regression model that consists of a response variable and a large number of potential explanatory variables and determine which variables are truly associated with the response. In 2015, Barber and Candes introduced a new variable selection procedure called the knockoff filter to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and proved that this method achieves exact FDR control. In this paper, we propose a prototype knockoff filter for group selection by extending the Reid-Tibshirani prototype method. Our prototype knockoff filter improves the computational efficiency and statistical power of the Reid-Tibshirani prototype method when it is applied for group selection. In some cases when the group features are spanned by one or a few hidden factors, we demonstrate that the PCA prototype knockoff filter outperforms the Dai-Barber group knockoff filter. We present several numerical experiments to compare our prototype knockoff filter with the Reid-Tibshirani prototype method and the group knockoff filter. We have also conducted some analysis of the knockoff filter. Our analysis reveals that some knockoff path method statistics, including the Lasso path statistic, may lead to loss of power for certain design matrices and a specially designed response even if their signal strengths are still relatively strong.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jiajie Chen"", ids = ""50763286""); list(name = ""Anthony Hou"", ids = ""4787782""); list(name = ""T.

e2c197b2b714765dad1ab841093453ba4a67431b,Interpretation of â€˜Omics dynamics in a single subject using local estimates of dispersion between two transcriptomes,"Calculating Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) from RNA-sequencing requires replicates to estimate gene-wise variability, infeasible in clinics. By imposing restrictive transcriptome-wide assumptions limiting inferential opportunities of conventional methods (edgeR, NOISeq-sim, DESeq, DEGseq), comparing two conditions without replicates (TCWR) has been proposed, but not evaluated. Under TCWR conditions (e.g., unaffected tissue vs. tumor), differences of transformed expression of the proposed individualized DEG (iDEG) method follow a distribution calculated across a local partition of related transcripts at baseline expression; thereafter the probability of each DEG is estimated by empirical Bayes with local false discovery rate control using a two-group mixture model. In extensive simulation studies of TCWR methods, iDEG and NOISeq are more accurate at 5%<DEGs<20% (precision>90%, recall>75%, false_positive_rate<1%) and 30%<DEGs<40% (precision=recallâˆ¼90%), respectively. The proposed iDEG method borrows localized distribution information from the same individual, a strategy that improves accuracy to compare transcriptomes in absence of replicates at low DEGs conditions. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/iDEG",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Qike Li"", ids = ""2266420""); list(name = ""Samir Rachid Zaim"", ids = ""30517233""); list(name = ""Dillon Aberasturi"", ids = ""67135941""); list(name = ""Joanne Berghout"", ids = ""48056394""); list(name = ""Haiquan Li"", ids = ""47893317""); list(name = ""Francesca Vitali"", ids = ""145844065""); list(name = ""Colleen Kenost"", ids = ""3416910""); list(name = ""Helen Hao Zhang"", ids = ""153504839""); list(name = ""Yves A.

3d897929e413e68d6a2ae416ae7b59c6ec1341df,Advancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with Multivariate Feature Selection and Semantically Motivated Features,"Automating aspects of biocuration through biomedical information extraction could signi cantly impact biomedical research by enabling greater biocuration throughput and improving the feasibility of a wider scope. An important step in biomedical information extraction systems is named entity recognition (NER), where mentions of entities such as proteins and diseases are located within natural-language text and their semantic type is determined. This step is critical for later tasks in an information extraction pipeline, including normalization and relationship extraction. BANNER is a benchmark biomedical NER system using linear-chain conditional random elds and the rich feature set approach. A case study with BANNER locating genes and proteins in biomedical literature is described. The rst corpus for disease NER adequate for use as training data is introduced, and employed in a case study of disease NER. The rst corpus locating adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in user posts to a health-related social website is also described, and a system to locate and identify ADRs in social media text is created and evaluated. The rich feature set approach to creating NER feature sets is argued to be subject to diminishing returns, implying that additional improvements may require more sophisticated methods for creating the feature set. This motivates the rst application of multivariate feature selection with lters and false discovery rate analysis to biomedical NER, resulting in a feature set at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the set created by the rich feature set approach. Finally, two novel approaches to NER by modeling the semantics of token sequences are introduced.

c0c3403caf46772731e8377dfb49088a52054bf3,Reporting FDR analogous confidence intervals for the log fold change of differentially expressed genes,"BackgroundGene expression experiments are common in molecular biology, for example in order to identify genes which play a certain role in a specified biological framework. For that purpose expression levels of several thousand genes are measured simultaneously using DNA microarrays. Comparing two distinct groups of tissue samples to detect those genes which are differentially expressed one statistical test per gene is performed, and resulting p-values are adjusted to control the false discovery rate. In addition, the expression change of each gene is quantified by some effect measure, typically the log fold change. In certain cases, however, a gene with a significant p-value can have a rather small fold change while in other cases a non-significant gene can have a rather large fold change. The biological relevance of the change of gene expression can be more intuitively judged by a fold change then merely by a p-value. Therefore, confidence intervals for the log fold change which accompany the adjusted p-values are desirable.ResultsIn a new approach, we employ an existing algorithm for adjusting confidence intervals in the case of high-dimensional data and apply it to a widely used linear model for microarray data. Furthermore, we adopt a concept of different relevance categories for effects in clinical trials to assess biological relevance of genes in microarray experiments. In a brief simulation study the properties of the adjusting algorithm are maintained when being combined with the linear model for microarray data. In two cancer data sets the adjusted confidence intervals can indicate significance of large fold changes and distinguish them from other large but non-significant fold changes. Adjusting of confidence intervals also corrects the assessment of biological relevance.ConclusionsOur new combination approach and the categorization of fold changes facilitates the selection of genes in microarray experiments and helps to interpret their biological relevance.",2011,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Klaus Jung"", ids = ""144268082""); list(name = ""Tim Friede"", ids = ""2711366""); list(name = ""Tim BeiÃŸbarth"", ids = ""4472076"")",6260ed47e9a52c27d11b766327d0f0cc3a7c9c42; 2f205a2a046f6b0571983210c6da01b6e21323ab; 756fa971611593fc537f4fd06f995f20a50d3627; d7e461dee33279558fe86ca3e246ab51c3203aac; 35aaa29d5bac7d9bd55be0a955d180422b6a9c33; adf6d3135cfba0977a3bfa1d7b0325dda70260ca; 249d454cff6eddb8ab18146569cbc39e9d162a92; a8704b7a8a3ee23692383965905dfa24306107c8; 539c736348c0e76a6c6b6807665c8197ae093465; e9b959f3a9a8e51d24ff497646f906dc3dca628c; 23fdd046235423d3008115e03f1eeacb54cfe955; c2a5332409cd2e5a433fd721bbc88b815c9e0c55; af16823beac07b510d1dffa34e5dff95d5465d4e; f9e2e4c4b5df0249db337e1d52bd25e31a854386; c0c3403caf46772731e8377dfb49088a52054bf3; 987f5873c330e049dc12f39c7474deaef90e9909; ef7ea92b3f337fa480c8cd681cab5ffbaa119088; e5221b15a56410721efc6ba8b7faeaf175925427,156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; c0c3403caf46772731e8377dfb49088a52054bf3; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 13bae0189ceed3604252aa9e14951fb4feb960f9; 0ad8d647e75655626b805301922e5ba912054b0a; f6c8eb11ba89c8a2b0d29f50224ccf4701fbf41c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 27aced0bb7f24332905d31f89ffeeb8b6549c3be; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; daf8ebed8b037b104b8cd36a878dde8da31c6bc5; 4e66ddf0c400f569fedb6f01242c0f33240b70be; f64ded7ebb45373ff747dc3f46ae5da3d04ae18d; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; a0e4f6f4d0abafa1c861b120812c180f9c1b7121; 761ce78ef852666c3c602090698e099d60718491; 4ad636f0005116be6858e74507f0144b243beb64; a2792d78d7bd427008232a007741d3347fdc2072; dc1f22cfff1672cf000c48d47e2ce1cb1b25c660; f0c8fc8ab280846d0e4e107adc6f115bddf37200,BMC Bioinformatics,12,288 - 288
ccbf6ffa7e299609ef3fa93e6846241140c67115,Genetic Mutation that May Contribute to Failure of Prolapse Surgery in White Women: A Case-Control Study.,"OBJECTIVE
To identify a potential genetic basis for early failure after prolapse surgery.


DESIGN
Case-control study (Canadian Task Force classification II).


SETTING
This study was carried out in 1 academic community medical center referral practice, and all patients had surgery at 1Â of 2 hospitals.


PATIENTS
Ten women with early, multicompartment prolapse recurrence after robotic sacrocolpopexy compared with 40 control subjects with known success after the same procedure.


INTERVENTIONS
Patients were treated with robotic sacrocolpopexy.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
DNA was isolated and initially genotyped on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to direct more detailed exome analyses. Exome sequences were mapped to the Human Genome Reference Sequence (GRCh37), and variants were compared between groups and to participants in the 1000 Genomes Project. Statistical analyses were performed using a software package commonly used in genetics research. TaqMan assay was used for verification, and pÂ values were adjusted using the false discovery rate. Demographics of groups were compared using Ï‡(2), Mann-Whitney U, and t tests. A SNP [rs171821] located near the ZFYVE16Â gene was associated with patients but not control subjects, and the false discovery rate-adjusted p value was .046 (odds ratio, 45.2; 95% confidence interval, 5.06-403). Exome analyses of this gene yielded another SNP [rs249038 (G/A)] in 6 of 10 patients and none of the control subjects (pÂ =Â .02). This SNP causes aÂ heterozygous missense mutation of glycine to serine predicted to be deleterious by the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer and was also very rare among participants in the 1000 Genomes Project (pÂ <Â .001).


CONCLUSIONS
Two SNPs located near the ZFYVE16 gene on chromosome 5 may have played a role in the early, multicompartment sacrocolpopexy failure experienced by our patients.

aa3e5fc9356d72884f8ec884535622166c1ef0c6,Effect of free thymol on differential gene expression in gastric mucosa of the young pig.,"Thymol is the most common molecule in thyme and has been proposed as an oral alternative to antibiotics in the feed of pigs and broilers. The knowledge of the in vivo physiological effects of thymol on tissues is limited, particularly its impact on the gastric mucosa, where it is primarily absorbed when it is orally supplied. In this study, thymol (TH, 50 mg/ kg BW) or a placebo (CO) was introduced directly into the stomach of 8 weaned pigs that were slaughtered 12 h later and sampled for gastric oxyntic and pyloric mucosa. The analysis of whole transcript expression was performed using AffymetrixÂ© Porcine Gene 1.1 ST array strips. Affymetrix Transcripts IDs were associated with 13 406 human gene names based on Sus scrofa Ensemble. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed, comparing TH and CO pigs. For each gene set, the normalized enrichment score (NES) was defined as significant when the false discovery rate % was <25 and the P-value of NES was <0.05. In response to TH, 72 and 19 gene sets were significantly enriched in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, respectively. Several gene sets involved in mitosis and its regulation ranked near the top, primarily in the oxyntic mucosa; the gene set DIGESTION ranked first and ninth in the pyloric and oxyntic mucosa, respectively. Within this group, somatostatin (SST), SST receptors, peptide transporter 1 (SLC15A1) and calpain 9 (gastrointestinal tract-specific calpain) were the most strongly upregulated genes. Thymol reduced the enrichment of 120 and 59 gene sets in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, respectively. Several gene sets related to ion transport and channeling and aqueous pores across membranes, including short transient receptor potential (TRP) channel 4, potassium voltage-gated channel members 1 and 2, and ryanodine receptors 2 and 3, were less enriched. The downregulation of these genes sensitive to thymol in vitro could depend on the thymol dose and contact with the gastric tissues that causes an adaptive response with their reduced activation. Conversely, the activation of the TRPA1 gene (ranked 1072 and 128 among all the genes in the oxyntic and pyloric mucosa, respectively) indicates the involvement of another TRP-regulating cellular calcium storage. In conclusion, the stimulation of gastric proliferative activity and the control of digestive activity by thymol can influence positively gastric maturation and function in the weaned pigs. These properties should be considered in addition to thymol's antimicrobial properties when supplementation of this molecule in feed is evaluated.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mara Colombo"", ids = ""153384716""); list(name = ""Davide Priori"", ids = ""3852775""); list(name = ""Gilberto Gandolfi"", ids = ""103630471""); list(name = ""Gianpiero Boatto"", ids = ""5471928""); list(name = ""Maria Nieddu"", ids = ""144544894""); list(name = ""Paolo Bosi"", ids = ""5414920""); list(name = ""Paolo Trevisi"", ids = ""3901719"")",ebfbf29cc72014a46cd32a6c7913ad4fab2d7117; 0f20af20409ba7489da9b99f258a2603b9fc0304; e58e2047fe1d78e682c210216d3429e3fff7ce4f; 020f066cd4b347c8121f06830b75cb1a961d4970; 1f3585d7393727f81044b35d7efed9c05ed12f22,348f4c8d4925f9b00c4949765798e6a83ed29310; 71928894b85802c5d293eedf77562c4acae77d4b; ad8efed769b0ec6d2dc0176bef5f48ba994a822b; 9a32a3d15ca4bf448185c70e6386a6d8da7509c0; f387f667461a75cd6ba6736c725dd663eb062796; 577fd7ce2d75fffa4b4a339b9260c57fd3d5d154; 17378705b2f4d16cf9d9afdf8af8704aa146a3cf; 06a97df1973f48ae4669679bf743fd0af08093c3; 61be717cb5a836f21476e391ba4b9647ef3e9cf2; 0b41ae53237043f41ab697c31fdf4daf6538bff5; 83c4c40b90f895fc09b161000a70e9e4a4d36e88; 5e01e1e49074c615461bf9191c57872593d1fa45; a01b8e36facb4b50e29a4741ce15c40d3e8a0ccc; 4733f0ebee6d8800f40ec905c353f9875962594e; bf933ea970d82fda9f36803c2943bab4cb8bc6bf; 889d923a47cf47cb3417d6184ec895053c9c6900; bf6019ba8ed44270122afc5506673106acc2d510; 3dc7e5d45cf10abe9b13d8d4f3d74fc31c8b268d; b755b864c183f90c926ae2204c2686cb8715f7eb; fd9fb7c1306f3df28d40336afdd4368ab17a7d3b; b05a4755dd6812fb91462d5ed837959dc60f6dc6; d6930cceadffa535a11698a6659e127c01de3729; b4bde25a4dbfd534271e62a572775d3c21784040; d8969929fd643dd0bb8e62b6ab71bc8053cb7673; 72a2ed5b7c4cab04c437da49c6af275b849946e4; e986f939f09b81d4d8616d4285e9188d15326685; 4cc2c82560dddd2b3e27a51dba8c3896acf62145; 7bb9a5724c63763304957ef536cff0ec270e6d6c; 7ebd21fa9a6eed19386c89a3cf784d543655ba5c; 7f5fc6bc2926cc94d6ded9a3a31930f239dc2443,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,8 5,"

87360e956b68ae17b2f4c15733efc426ff916221,The clinicomolecular landscape of de novo versus relapsed stage IV metastatic breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND
de novo metastatic breast cancer (dnMBC) is responsible for 6-10% of breast cancer presentations with increasing incidence and has remained resistant to detection by mammography screening. Recent publications hypothesized that in addition to poor screening uptake, the presentation of dnMBC may be due to its unfavourable biology which remains unknown at the molecular level. Here we investigated the tumour biology of dnMBC in the form of clinicopathology, genomic alterations and differential gene expression to create a comparative landscape of de novo versus relapsed metastatic breast cancer (rMBC). Additionally, to address the current screening limitations, we conducted a preliminary biomarker investigation for early dnMBC detection.


METHODS
In this retrospective case-control study, gene expression and clinical data were accessed from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for primary tumours of treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with dnMBC (nâ€¯=â€¯17), rMBC (nâ€¯=â€¯49), and normal tissue (nâ€¯=â€¯113). The clinical and histological data were assessed categorically using Fisher's Exact-Test for significance (pâ€¯<â€¯.05), or continuously using the Mann-Whitney Test (pâ€¯<â€¯.05) where appropriate. The differential gene expression analysis was performed using EdgeR's negative binomial distribution model with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. The resulting gene list was analysed manually for roles in metastasis as well as ontologically using STRING-DB with FDR <0.05.


RESULTS
dnMBCs showed improved median survival vs rMBC (36 vs. 12â€¯months). dnMBCs were more likely to be hormone receptor positive, less likely to be triple negative with lower histological lymphocytic infiltrate. In terms of genome alterations, dnMBCs had 4-fold increased PTEN mutations and poor survival with ABL2 and GATA3 alterations. Expression-wise, dnMBCs down-regulated TNFa, IL-17 signalling, and chemotaxis, while up-regulating steroid biosynthesis, cell migration, and cell adhesion. Biomarker analysis detected pre-existing and novel breast cancer biomarkers.


CONCLUSION
The comparative tumour landscape revealed significant clinical, pathological and molecular differences between dnMBC and rMBC, indicating that dnMBC may be a separate biological entity to rMBC at the primary level with differing paths to metastasis. Additionally, we provided a list of potential serum biomarkers that may be useful in detecting dnMBC in its pre-metastatic window if such a window exists.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sean Seltzer"", ids = ""145145172""); list(name = ""Mark Anthony Corrigan"", ids = ""5146295""); list(name = ""SÃ©amus O'Reilly"", ids = ""1421864772"")",,,Experimental and molecular pathology,,"

48bcce3831a5f0c78973990f0aa2ca650b904b7c,Detecting multiple associations in genome-wide studies,"Recent developments in the statistical analysis of genome-wide studies are reviewed. Genome-wide analyses are becoming increasingly common in areas such as scans for disease-associated markers and gene expression profiling. The data generated by these studies present new problems for statistical analysis, owing to the large number of hypothesis tests, comparatively small sample size and modest number of true gene effects. In this review, strategies are described for optimising the genotyping cost by discarding promising genes at an earlier stage, saving resources for the genes that show a trend of association. In addition, there is a review of new methods of analysis that combine evidence across genes to increase sensitivity to multiple true associations in the presence of many non-associated genes. Some methods achieve this by including only the most significant results, whereas others model the overall distribution of results as a mixture of distributions from true and null effects. Because genes are correlated even when having no effect, permutation testing is often necessary to estimate the overall significance, but this can be very time consuming. Efficiency can be improved by fitting a parametric distribution to permutation replicates, which can be re-used in subsequent analyses. Methods are also available to generate random draws from the permutation distribution. The review also includes discussion of new error measures that give a more reasonable interpretation of genome-wide studies, together with improved sensitivity. The false discovery rate allows a controlled proportion of positive results to be false, while detecting more true positives; and the local false discovery rate and false-positive report probability give clarity on whether or not a statistically significant test represents a real discovery.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Frank Dudbridge"", ids = ""1962716""); list(name = ""Arief Gusnanto"", ids = ""3345179""); list(name = ""Bobby P C Koeleman"", ids = ""35522294"")",95854baeacaed5b9294f7dc39a1991e7b26055c9; 2c4cae3e7a200b6bc2968ad29f33989e65cd19b8; ae4771719cf42f6d85dfa88f5a665e964cdd7332; 4031c328b5559b24f94dd03c9ada21d09920fd91; 661ac9d351a7f5a7c431325f995feec2c6164d93; a4c5c13cf2585a60b3dd38a5f9bbefe7de775a0e; 88241b390f81d84900aa0215447622304b43c579; 07a4c3e3bbc56924868cb5e95f9f4ff0ca1706e3; ca0a2c5edfaa7d177a8babd3ab82120fab538d28; d423e0a4aaaa18c5ce23a54df12171b922a55978; 0b14b1c7dee82fa3058b3cc665bc7bbbcb31b1d0; 73dd973279391eb23605ee6a1eba71b764aa91f2; a23beece87dc704ebdc3e4cefd8a11019f1c9d8c; 67c7644d91fc5377da1b14349a08f193d1e33586; 321812a62fa45c913f422a5da63942ca5e01a43b; 63cf7c45dc4a72a0dcca882329bf6200913e31a5; 4f86ac6903c26df7b3a03f11da0c715b87fb1f4f; 5c9bc5ce2e55fa145b3af3e55d2f3077c974b973; f80712bf9e61527a27c6f509d8e92ae2733102a6; 9e6453a7590af6065950be4ec504ac70a76d5b60; b05cd379b12b4f4fffc0a660cbf7134bd261aa9f; b1739466efe72413ac55dc1cc10cd0424383524d; 97c9622232ce9551d854d0ae2841dc5558d1192d; ccdfca0efc0be6ead62c7d82a5a6d5c360194c1c; 5673707c036c0da9bc29295f7c4a1ca7ab92323c; 7953f13bc46b059db0ef6960e0a02429d2908871; b9ce2e2af08a1826ee8362c7d9d9418756d451e4,2a08635426caed4c8a046abe2302c5c6e223e52f; 96ef799148b63e2f4399cb454b1dd1b0c6836c3d; 3d157ead0da8d2ae9960b3b82dde17fb5a381afd; 36d7d5c7cf44089ca04df441105e57bd7f29afd2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 03b3715c866285aa035e9617dd9356d8534e4f70; c0b9bc9d2855e43ef2571b7894df35732fc824e1; 18a553b6c73224100b6175e407343a43617a5568; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 028f19578df47157bfd1659ac2623dbf77d5f21e; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; c59d0629883aad3f53aad6873c505e6fbd17da4c; c8fe0f42c1c823d41301fa60f23c4eb36319c6fc; 638c43d29265787d1aa1c074c0fe2b5db62e1e49; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 1bf5b0939b61bf34e39678248464497095ebd836; 0b14dd86059c4398bec99e767a23efaeae33ca40; 25e57d21f6e4ff5276574f6a6d6c638466d97b7f; 6cd435383c457686d1425adf0412d95169d3d301; 13bffa222f04f023be4cb64d35e393a86dcfd4b9; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 50b8e1ac8936c864fbe155bc4ec3dbd61b5beab4; b83e96720100c2b399b75cee2a75f7e0e45b5499; 47c59c9ec2d4452742d04eccfed53e793355b840; 6756da5a0d5e037a0c143e6418b85633561c927c; 1b93cb1032fdf2032c0f2e04d028c7e73f652068; a740f0d0055af7974b3fc63be5bf307f007438b6; bf73f74680730c3e894e6ec897dd07516d78fb7f; 0eef08d31a80b41105ebf7f20c1753fca9d06549; 4b3b1d6d0a8d77a3a2c4c8b76ee3f9211b9a03eb; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 8327279f02a1a919b594704d5e8794734f61184e; 44900f37359abfb129973f0adb3ce56f90eb395a; 7bd1a8963af4c0f6f4c2f1fca30d27c0dac20b1e; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 7ef57d33dd28cbccc7eeed735fa1a4400e98b8be; 9c2b6790809f541544fd51bf61975db04c54a745; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 9616f36d11b0e83159716b5dfdd14cfc060a8ebc; 6f72b939ccb69eff56cdad38c6acfd6c333769c6; 5d6aa71ab6c5b4e7cc6538b15dc34e41aea68c23; 6a338a35f802c36038d745166199cd7db7832f53; c4a29ee9e15f23ba79b6788520b4bac1c6b36354; 366003669e61dca233d05d5697159584119099e0; e9296103e70f3a1e5781dead6d59bb29c81e9c41; 64af617824b16a3424f9674e3950c288d997ff21; 543eab8bedb30a35120a0791d76cc2bfad8583fb; d0bcdb2df3ae4d478554ec9131011b5de06f5a08; f945f6f12acb6fd2dfaabef0a9bb1bd50daf35a8; 3a75238ece227dadba042ee1727f0e0a7798bb26; 6122f1e84c0dab96dc6b31659c29524f8b6f1e66; 7b06771ee8f39e516056df3365cd1cb679b5041f; 4d6022aa45c5289f9e1cc378c8348f97e1625be4; be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 42cfbc87f5b1bcf6eda42a8c4d982a4c1dc32990; 0ddf2646929ce22bb189ef0e6232fcea4e5404c2; 0b974f02762f987b7a3e8ff7f17fb6da8c4467c7; 22ea4f2cb76201552bc50316b2a10e4b45b4bbc4,Human Genomics,2,310 - 317
9c7752a74a7ce9611c6f4c88c14cffbcb2a342a4,Statistical analysis of fNIRS data: A comprehensive review,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive method to measure brain activities using the changes of optical absorption in the brain through the intact skull. fNIRS has many advantages over other neuroimaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography (MEG), since it can directly measure blood oxygenation level changes related to neural activation with high temporal resolution. However, fNIRS signals are highly corrupted by measurement noises and physiology-based systemic interference. Careful statistical analyses are therefore required to extract neuronal activity-related signals from fNIRS data. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of historical developments of statistical analyses of fNIRS signal, which include motion artifact correction, short source-detector separation correction, principal component analysis (PCA)/independent component analysis (ICA), false discovery rate (FDR), serially-correlated errors, as well as inference techniques such as the standard t-test, F-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and statistical parameter mapping (SPM) framework. In addition, to provide a unified view of various existing inference techniques, we explain a linear mixed effect model with restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) variance estimation, and show that most of the existing inference methods for fNIRS analysis can be derived as special cases.

d3399c8db9b79fbca3ab48ab59911d143e7f39ba,"Abstract 4739: Interactions between variants of angiogenesis pathway genes and reflux symptom, BMI, and smoking in esophageal adenocarcinoma susceptibility","Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is a complex malignancy that involves multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Genetic polymorphisms in angiogenesis pathway, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (reflux), higher body mass index (BMI), and tobacco smoking have been individually associated with EA development. However, interactions among multiple factors in EA risk have not been well characterized. We conducted a case-only study to investigate gene-environment interactions among 145 functional/tagging SNPs of angiogenesis pathway genes, reflux, smoking, and BMI in 335 patients with EA. We used a two-stage approach to detect interactions: first, we applied random forest (RF) approach to select important interacting markers based on mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in GINI index; then we estimated the interaction odds ratios (OR inter ) of RF selected interaction markers by case-only logistic regression, adjusting for covariates and false discovery rate (FDR). We identified twelve interaction markers that were significantly associated with EA risk (all FDR_Ps inter =2.27; 95% CI, 1.44-3.57), reflux*rs996999 (MMP1) (OR inter =1.80; 95%CI, 1.12-2.89), reflux*rs13337626 (TSC2) (OR inter =2.18; 95%CI, 1.15-4.12), BMI*rs2114039 (PDGFRA) (OR inter =2.06; 95%CI, 1.29-3.30), BMI*rs6554164 (PDGFRA) (OR inter =1.92; 95% CI, 1.20-3.08), and BMI*rs17708574 (PDGFRB) (OR inter =1.89; 95%CI, 1.12-3.18) were significantly associated with increased risk of EA. On the other hand, six interaction markers, including reflux*rs2519757 (TSC1) (OR inter =0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.83), smoking*rs2295778 (HIF1AN) (OR inter =0.45; 95%CI, 0.26-0.79), smoking*rs2296188 (FLT1) (OR inter =0.50; 95%CI, 0.28-0.87), BMI*rs2296188 (FLT1) (OR inter =0.41; 95%CI, 0.24-0.73), BMI*rs11941492 (KDR) (OR inter =0.52; 95%CI, 0.32-0.85), and BMI*rs17619601 (FLT1) (OR inter =0.26; 95%CI, 0.09-0.75) were significantly associated with decreased risk of EA. These findings suggest that variants in angiogenesis pathway genes, reflux, smoking, and BMI jointly contribute to EA development through gene-environment interactions.

097895734a884d2ccd08016b28ef2c29db567b37,Genetic variation in H2AFX contributes to risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises a group of lymphoid tumors that have in common somatic translocations. H2AFX encodes a key histone involved in the detection of the DNA double-stranded breaks that can lead to translocations. H2afx is a dosage-dependent gene that protects against B-cell lymphomas in mice, making its human orthologue an ideal candidate gene for susceptibility to lymphoma. We did a population-based genetic association study of H2AFX variants in 487 NHL cases and 531 controls. Complete resequencing of the human H2AFX gene in 95 NHL cases was done to establish the spectrum of variation in affected individuals; this was followed by both direct and indirect tests for association at the level of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and as haplotypes. Homozygosity for the AA genotype of a SNP 417 bp upstream of the translational start of H2AFX is strongly associated [odds ratio (OR), 0.54; P = 0.001] with protection from NHL. We find a strong association of this SNP with the follicular lymphoma subtype of NHL (AA genotype: OR, 0.40; P = 0.004) and with mantle cell lymphoma (AA genotype: OR, 0.20; P = 0.01) that remains significant after adjustment for the false discovery rate, but not with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These data support the hypothesis that genetic variation in the H2AFX gene influences genetic susceptibility or resistance to some subtypes of NHL by contributing to the maintenance of genome stability.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Karen L Novik"", ids = ""6602640""); list(name = ""John J.

33952efdfac1060e9b2e681c397e4abdae045f6d,A New Method to Find Image Recovery,"Scattering media imagery is degraded during the physical process of image formation, which shifts contrast, color, and turns overall visibility white. With the computer vision system, sight can be amazingly restored. Although the medium transmission in distant artifacts is small, it is vulnerable to amplification of the noise. Here we present / propose the picture recovery of the L0 gradient, which solves the issue discussed previously. In comparison to raw images, the single image is processed and recovered significantly improves while noise amplification discards. The state-of-the-art studies on dehazing have been reviewed in this paper. In addition, L0-gradient minimization of image smoothing was studied in combination with H Kosmedier Image Formation Physical System to solve the dehazing issue as L0 smoothing approximates better results with higher false discovery rate (FDR) .Recovery using L0-Gradient Minimization is formalized in a depth chart that reduces noise adaptively to recover estimated structures marginally in spatially changing media delivery. The minimal gradient is non-zero. Therefore, noise and blur in the nearby objects with low measurement difficulty and impact have been effectively removed, raising the transmitting approximation contributing to the enhancement of the recovered image. We are experimenting with atmospheric, submarine, at night, indoor turbid medium images qualitatively and quantitatively.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nouf Saeed Alotaibi"", ids = ""121483507"")",,2d470badfbf805f6e9450863320ea9e08336424a; db0fd1d8b1ef0bf19a137cd535166ed067455280; f26677620c6daca3d569778d929fba19bf005052; d3ffea5354222834a48ccb057de8628f63297e89; ed4683971a9a8adc18282ce47bd593b896cb5c28; d8e64b01b2c819f4a95c6dc86df584cd2cae2d31; cd9e940df9308cddd36e782d7000783a8a94133a; 444537108d9171272bfbb0eccd7a3855ada66b0d; 54f2fc1e74d4b1b9b28e32d5b72b0ebe76ad37bf; 000b9a90bbea62e4222704c616c0c2ee65609aa7; 83829d31cd18317ce12a8a0fcd71126b817cb96e; 1a7eeecf47f9ab4fa506fd2c34f4aa2d6b508ef8; 912b5d15a6a9fcb14919dbc1885dd42bab0687b1; 523d8aa0aae3239b82a499562c0696118edf67d3; 1deb84164223a3468a80b376befc7e0b7261a36b,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,10,

However, the underlying causes remain unclear. In this study, gene expression in decidua basalis tissue from pregnancies complicated with PE and/or FGR (n = 18) and normal pregnancies (n = 17) was assessed by Affymetrix HG Focus microarray to obtain hints of mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis. A total of 200 differentially expressed transcripts were detected at a false discovery rate (FDR) <or= 0.1. Several genes involved in trophoblast differentiation and invasion were downregulated, including the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP1, -7 and -12. MMPs are a family of enzymes involved in degradation of extracellular matrix and have been ascribed a permissive role in trophoblast invasion. MMP1 had the highest fold change among the differentially expressed genes (four-fold downregulated) and was chosen for further investigation. Reduced MMP1 mRNA in decidual tissue was confirmed by RT-qPCR. MMP1 protein expression in EVTs was assessed by double immunofluorescence analysis, using antibodies against pro-MMP1 and cytokeratin 7. The proportion of MMP1 positive EVTs was reduced in all subgroups of cases (PE: n = 18, FGR: n = 11 and PE + FGR: n = 30) compared to controls (n = 23) (all p's < 0.05). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that reduced levels of MMP1 protein in EVTs could be linked to the impaired trophoblast invasion in PE and/or FGR.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ingrid Alsos Lian"", ids = ""6784934""); list(name = ""Johanne Holm Toft"", ids = ""40395792""); list(name = ""Guro Dalheim Olsen"", ids = ""12177271""); list(name = ""Mette Langaas"", ids = ""2899111""); list(name = ""Line BjÃ¸rge"", ids = ""4153731""); list(name = ""Irina Poliakova Eide"", ids = ""47084315""); list(name = ""Per E.

2964286e0963c6f9e475bf3698aa08025d10fe1b,Application of alternative models to identify QTL for growth traits in an F2 Duroc x Pietrain pig resource population,"BackgroundA variety of analysis approaches have been applied to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) in experimental populations. The initial genome scan of our Duroc x Pietrain F2 resource population included 510 F2 animals genotyped with 124 microsatellite markers and analyzed using a line-cross model. For the second scan, 20 additional markers on 9 chromosomes were genotyped for 954 F2 animals and 20 markers used in the first scan were genotyped for 444 additional F2 animals. Three least-squares Mendelian models for QTL analysis were applied for the second scan: a line-cross model, a half-sib model, and a combined line-cross and half-sib model.ResultsIn total, 26 QTL using the line-cross model, 12 QTL using the half-sib model and 3 additional QTL using the combined line-cross and half-sib model were detected for growth traits with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) significance level. In the line-cross analysis, highly significant QTL for fat deposition at 10-, 13-, 16-, 19-, and 22-wk of age were detected on SSC6. In the half-sib analysis, a QTL for loin muscle area at 19-wk of age was detected on SSC7 and QTL for 10th-rib backfat at 19- and 22-wk of age were detected on SSC15.ConclusionsAdditional markers and animals contributed to reduce the confidence intervals and increase the test statistics for QTL detection.

666a4ef2615212f23528b72e849eaa3d250f3a5b,Gut microbiota differs between children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and healthy siblings in taxonomic and functional composition: a metagenomic analysis.,"Current treatment for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is often ineffective, with serious side effects. Manipulating the gut microbiota via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging treatment approach but remains controversial. We aimed to assess the composition of the fecal microbiome through a comparison of pediatric IBD patients to their healthy siblings, evaluating risks and prospects for FMT in this setting. A case-control (sibling) study was conducted analyzing fecal samples of six children with Crohn's disease (CD), six children with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 healthy siblings by metagenomic sequencing. In addition, lifetime antibiotic intake was retrospectively determined. Species richness and diversity were significantly reduced in UC patients compared with control [Mann-Whitney U-test false discovery rate (MWU FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.011]. In UC, bacteria positively influencing gut homeostasis, e.g., Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were significantly reduced in abundance (MWU FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.05). Known pathobionts like Escherichia coli were enriched in UC patients (MWU FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.084). Moreover, E. coli abundance correlated positively with that of several virulence genes (SCC > 0.65, FDR < 0.1). A shift toward antibiotic-resistant taxa in both IBD groups distinguished them from controls [MWU Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli procedure (BY) FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.062 in UC, MWU BY FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.019 in CD). The collected results confirm a microbial dysbiosis in pediatric UC, and to a lesser extent in CD patients, replicating associations found previously using different methods. Taken together, these observations suggest microbiotal remodeling therapy from family donors, at least for children with UC, as a viable option.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this sibling study, prior reports of microbial dysbiosis in IBD patients from 16S rRNA sequencing was verified using deep shotgun sequencing and augmented with insights into the abundance of bacterial virulence genes and bacterial antibiotic resistance determinants, seen against the background of data on the specific antibiotic intake of each of the study participants. The observed dysbiosis, which distinguishes patients from siblings, highlights such siblings as potential donors for microbiotal remodeling therapy in IBD.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rebecca L Knoll"", ids = ""4664343""); list(name = ""Kristoffer Forslund"", ids = ""47156042""); list(name = ""Jens Roat Kultima"", ids = ""2855576""); list(name = ""Claudius U.

f50f91be69674c23f49af225481b5b11850d2d6f,Whole blood sequencing reveals circulating microRNA associations with high-risk traits in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Although circulating microRNA (miRNAs) have emerged as biomarkers predicting mortality in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), more data are needed to understand these mechanisms. Mapping miRNAs to high-risk traits may identify miRNAs involved in pathways conferring risk for poor outcome in ACS. We aim to investigate the relationship between circulating miRNAs and high-risk traits in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).


METHODS
Whole-genome miRNA sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from whole blood of 199 patients with NSTE-ACS. Generalized linear models were used to test associations of miRNAs and 13 high-risk clinical traits, including the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, a widely validated risk score for mortality in NSTE-ACS.


RESULTS
There were 205 nominally significant miRNA-risk factor associations (pÂ <Â 0.05) observed. Significant associations occurred most frequently with chronic heart failure (HF) (43 miRs), GRACE risk score (30 miRs), and renal function (32 miRs). In hierarchical cluster analysis, chronic HF and GRACE risk score clustered most tightly together, sharing 14 miRNAs with matching fold-change direction. Controlling for a false discovery rate of 5%, chronic HF was significantly associated with lower circulating levels of miR-3135b (pÂ <Â 0.0006), miR-126-5p (pÂ <Â 0.0001), miR-142-5p (pÂ =Â 0.0004) and miR-144-5p (pÂ =Â 0.0007), while increasing GRACE risk score inversely correlated with levels of miR-3135b (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and positively correlated with levels of miR-28-3p (pÂ =Â 0.0002).


CONCLUSIONS
Circulating miRs clustered around two powerful traits for mortality risk in NSTE-ACS. MiR-3135b, which was under-expressed in chronic HF and increasing GRACE risk score, and miR-28-3p, which has no known association with cardiovascular disease, warrant further investigation.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alice P.

427c831dbf7b4d04a91cc044850e009fedca2c83,Network Analysis Reveals the Connection Between Chronic Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Cancer,"The relationship between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer needs further exploration in a system view. We constructed chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer network based on gene expression data and protein-protein interaction, and then analyzed the global topological features of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer genes. Transcriptome profiling-based network analysis reveals the importance of chronic pancreatitis genes in pancreatic cancer by computational method. Background Exploring the mechanism of disease progression is a meaningful challenge in biomedicine. Many approaches have been developed to identify disease-associated genes and pathways [1, 2]. The biological network is the basis of complex biological systems and a leading method deciphering in complex diseases [3, 4]. Conventional approaches are not enough in clarifying complex diseases, because most molecules function through complex networks in an integrated fashion [5]. Network-based approaches to inflammation and cancer research are developed with the high-throughput data [6, 7]. This paper focuses on inflammation which is one of the important drivers of cancer [8, 9]. Integrating the information from inflammation and cancer is helpful to understand the nature of cancer. Inflammation and cancer are complex processes regulated by both environment and genetics [10]. Here, we emphasize the relationships between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer at a network level since chronic inflammation is a process of gradual decay of homeostasis increasing the susceptibility to cancer. Moreover, the risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) is significantly elevated in subjects with chronic pancreatitis (CP) [10]. In this paper, we used the transcriptional profiles, protein-protein interaction (PPI), pathway into network, and constructed a chronic pancreatitis-pancreatic cancer network (CPPCN) in gene level.

The authors Published by Atlantis Press 386 Methods Gene Expression Data and Differential Expressed Genes Gene expression profiling data E-EMBL-6 were obtained from the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute database [11], which contain the stages of normal state, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, each with 9 samples. The 27 samples of normal state, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer were used in this research. The differential expressed genes of CP and PC were obtained by t-test with the local false discovery rates (FDR)<0.05 using the fdrtool package [12]. Network Construction and Analysis The differential expressed genes are mapped to the PPI network combining KEGG and Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and the connected components were extracted, CP, PC and CP-PC network were constructed [13].The network parameters were analyzed by cytoscape [14].",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lisha Li"", ids = ""8446798""); list(name = ""Heping Wang"", ids = ""48016804""); list(name = ""Yulin Li"", ids = ""1952844"")",,6a79847d4ad7b5088aa7b041bc9eb229086d35c0; d4db8ea151c3194891ff5a22d112fd00867f15af; 906947ee847fb92b45cf61876aff435d73a82489; 2566b2bca41c63e853593e85ff58453ad6833390; 8ac95c4795b9d3575fccb2a3d5a5fe2c922d594b; dab8f6d462d5aca18d7b146eb7865a674f2eca88; fcb7d992d789e5070a18c3619fb7905513d4300f; 50d4da2db6faf82a99e8c35d5410e9d10099a279; b3a9e344a32ad6ca402d9149ac74b2b1df9e3076; 3f3643d1de0d793392105804bfc76fd1cfc5fd2f; 9a39e80d9bae8fb7b6b087c32e8357e2b9f101b7; 01a0a1425d1ffe6feaa2b83a4472a4d34fa7e586; a462ee3d64edf189e075451ca7cb728bcc9e5fb3,,,
f1f9366931c77d3303d51375fa35eda1431fcc20,Statin-induced expression change of INSIG1 in lymphoblastoid cell lines correlates with plasma triglyceride statin response in a sex-specific manner,"Statins are widely prescribed to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. They also modestly reduce plasma triglyceride (TG), an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor, in most people. The mechanism and inter-individual variability of TG statin response is poorly understood. We measured statin-induced gene expression changes in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 150 participants of a simvastatin clinical trial and identified 23 genes (false discovery rate, FDR=15%) with expression changes correlated with plasma TG response. The correlation of insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) expression changes with TG response (rho=0.32, q=0.11) was driven by men (interaction P=0.0055). rs73161338 was associated with INSIG1 expression changes (P=5.4 Ã— 10âˆ’5) and TG response in two statin clinical trials (P=0.0048), predominantly in men. A combined model including INSIG1 expression level and splicing changes accounted for 29.5% of plasma TG statin response variance in men (P=5.6 Ã— 10âˆ’6). Our results suggest that INSIG1 variation may contribute to statin-induced changes in plasma TG in a sex-specific manner.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Elizabeth Theusch"", ids = ""5979423""); list(name = ""Kyungpil Kim"", ids = ""39900620""); list(name = ""Kristen Stevens"", ids = ""15377773""); list(name = ""Joshua D.

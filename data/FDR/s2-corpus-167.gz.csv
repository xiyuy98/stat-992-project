6fa98bda60652413611a6a9ad92547dd0bf5a07a,Concordance of Genetic Variation that Increases Risk for Tourette Syndrome and that Influences its Underlying Neurocircuitry,"BACKGROUND There have been considerable recent advances in understanding the genetic architecture of Tourette Syndrome (TS) as well as its underlying neurocircuitry. However, the mechanisms by which genetic variations that increase risk for TS - and its main symptom dimensions - influence relevant brain regions are poorly understood. Here we undertook a genome-wide investigation of the overlap between TS genetic risk and genetic influences on the volume of specific subcortical brain structures that have been implicated in TS. METHODS We obtained summary statistics for the most recent TS genome-wide association study (GWAS) from the TS Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Working Group (4,644 cases and 8,695 controls) and GWAS of subcortical volumes from the ENIGMA consortium (30,717 individuals). We also undertook analyses using GWAS summary statistics of key symptom factors in TS, namely social disinhibition and symmetry behaviour. SNP Effect Concordance Analysis (SECA) was used to examine genetic pleiotropy - the same SNP affecting two traits - and concordance - the agreement in SNP effect directions across these two traits. In addition, a conditional false discovery rate (FDR) analysis was performed, conditioning the TS risk variants on each of the seven subcortical and the intracranial brain volume GWAS. Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSR) was used as validation of SECA. RESULTS SECA revealed significant pleiotropy between TS and putaminal (p=2Ã—10âˆ’4) and caudal (p=4Ã—10âˆ’4) volumes, independent of direction of effect, and significant concordance between TS and lower thalamic volume (p=1Ã—10âˆ’3). LDSR lent additional support for the association between TS and thalamic volume (p=5.85Ã—10âˆ’2). Furthermore, SECA revealed significant evidence of concordance between the social disinhibition symptom dimension and lower thalamic volume (p=1Ã—10âˆ’3), as well as concordance between symmetry behaviour and greater putaminal volume (p=7Ã—10âˆ’4). Conditional FDR analysis further revealed novel variants significantly associated with TS (p<8Ã—10âˆ’7) when conditioning on intracranial (rs2708146, q=0.046; and rs72853320, q=0.035 and hippocampal (rs1922786, q=0.001 volumes respectively. CONCLUSION These data indicate concordance for genetic variations involved in disorder risk and subcortical brain volumes in TS. Further work with larger samples is needed to fully delineate the genetic architecture of these disorders and their underlying neurocircuitry.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Mary Mufford"", ids = ""29829208""); list(name = ""Josh W Cheung"", ids = ""80692147""); list(name = ""Neda Jahanshad"", ids = ""81207745""); list(name = ""Celia van der Merwe"", ids = ""30774828""); list(name = ""Linda Ding"", ids = ""3266255""); list(name = ""Nynke A.

237dfa1fdd8a61dec1d0994e7f13b7c58983e06d,Gene coexpression network discovery with controlled statistical and biological significance,"Many biological functions are executed as a module of coexpressed genes which can be conveniently viewed as a coexpression network. Genes are network vertices and significant pairwise coexpression are network edges. Traditional network discovery methods control either statistical significance or biological significance, but not both. We have designed and implemented a two-stage algorithm that controls both the statistical significance (false discovery rate, FDR) and the biological significance (minimum acceptable strength, MAS) of the discovered network. Based on the estimation of pairwise gene profile correlation, the algorithm provides an initial network discovery that controls only FDR, which is then followed by a second network discovery which controls both FDR and MAS. We illustrate the algorithm for discovery of coexpression networks for yeast galactose metabolism with controlled FDR and MAS.",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dongxiao Zhu"", ids = ""39895985""); list(name = ""Alfred O.

By modeling the worm as a sine curve, sin(2Ï€x â€“ Ï‰t), the induced fluid flow around the worm can be studied using the method of regularized stokeslets. As with any numerical method, there is an error associated with this modeling process. This error is the focus of my research. I compute the arc length of the worm using multiple methods to examine whether this has any impact on error in this modeling process. I compare the output of each in order to study sources of error in our calculations of the movement of the artificial worm. I found that the two methods yielded different results. Title: Oh Rats... Statistics: Relationship between Renin-Angiotensin System and Sex Speakers: Katelyn Thomas and Christophe Langouet (Faculty advisor: Nusrat Jahan) Abstract: Renin-angiotensin is a blood pressure regulator and plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular disease and kidney damage. Previous studies indicate a higher frequency of men developing renal damage potentially related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The Bauer et al. (2011) microarray study seeks to find the impact of sex and gene expression on renal damage development. We analyzed their gene expression data, controlling false discovery rate at 0.01 level. Significant genes were further analyzed with a two-way ANOVA to investigate the effects of sex on the RAS system. Cluster analysis was performed on the significant genes to investigate genomic interrelationships.

969098873d15d4a551c26cb2b2ef01ae4c45458f,Spatial False Discovery Rate Control for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to study the population effects of covariates on brain morphometry. Inferences from these studies often require the simultaneous testing of millions of statistical hypotheses. Such scale of simultaneous testing is known to lead to large numbers of false positive results. False discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures are commonly employed to mitigate against false positives. However, current methodologies in FDR control only account for the marginal significance of hypotheses and are not able to take into account spatial relationships, such as in MRI studies. In this article, we present a novel method for incorporating spatial dependencies in the control of FDR through the use of Markov random fields. Our method is able to automatically estimate the relationship between spatially dependent hypotheses by means of pseudo-likelihood techniques. We show that the our spatial FDR control method is able to outperform marginal methods in simulations of spatially dependent hypotheses. Our method is then applied to investigate the effect of aging on brain morphometry using data from the PATH study. The results of our investigation were found to be in correspondence with the brain aging literature.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hien Duy Nguyen"", ids = ""153609534""); list(name = ""Andrew L.

It has been proposed that these anterior parahippocampal structures play a key role in recognition memory. We studied the voxel-based PET correlation between number of correctly recognized targets in a new recognition memory paradigm and interictal cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, in 15 patients with TLE with hippocampal sclerosis. In comparison to healthy subjects, patients had decreased recognition of targets (P<0.001) and ipsilateral hypometabolism (relative to side of hippocampal sclerosis) of the hippocampus, entorhinal/perirhinal cortices, medial temporal pole, and middle temporal gyrus (P<0.05, corrected by false discovery rate method). Performance correlated with interictal metabolism of ipsilateral entorhinal/perirhinal cortices (P<0.005, Spearman's rank test), but this relationship was not significant in the hippocampus itself (P>0.18, Spearman's rank test). These findings highlight the preferential involvement of entorhinal/perirhinal cortices in recognition memory in patients with TLE, and suggest that recognition memory paradigms may be useful in assessing anterior parahippocampal functional status in TLE.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric Guedj"", ids = ""150090396""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

e0ef680bbd8046af194c31eeee3221dce8e59c4a,Application of de Novo Sequencing to Large-Scale Complex Proteomics Data Sets.,"Dependent on concise, predefined protein sequence databases, traditional search algorithms perform poorly when analyzing mass spectra derived from wholly uncharacterized protein products. Conversely, de novo peptide sequencing algorithms can interpret mass spectra without relying on reference databases. However, such algorithms have been difficult to apply to complex protein mixtures, in part due to a lack of methods for automatically validating de novo sequencing results. Here, we present novel metrics for benchmarking de novo sequencing algorithm performance on large-scale proteomics data sets and present a method for accurately calibrating false discovery rates on de novo results. We also present a novel algorithm (LADS) that leverages experimentally disambiguated fragmentation spectra to boost sequencing accuracy and sensitivity. LADS improves sequencing accuracy on longer peptides relative to that of other algorithms and improves discriminability of correct and incorrect sequences. Using these advancements, we demonstrate accurate de novo identification of peptide sequences not identifiable using database search-based approaches.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arun Devabhaktuni"", ids = ""16057477""); list(name = ""Joshua E.

The first included15 paired untreated hormone-sensitive ""pre-AA"" and 3-month ""post-AA"" specimens; the second included 10 ""early AA failure"" (median time to AA failure:11 months) and the third included 10 ""late AA failure"" specimens (median time to AA failure: 95 months). Proteomic analysis was performed with isobaric mass tags for relative and absolute quanititation (iTRAQ) analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Differentially expressed candidate proteins were identified by comparisons of (i) paired pre/post-AA proteomes and (ii) post-AA proteome with the combined AA failure cohorts at a False Discovery Rate of 0.2. ELISA assays were used to verify candidate markers in a second stored aliquot of first cohort specimens. This cohort was followed for AA failure. Association of post-AA ELISA levels of candidate markers with time to AA failure was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression, summarized as relative risk (RR) for AA failure.


RESULTS
Median PSA in pre/post-AA first cohort were 3.15 ng/ml and 0.29 ng/ml. Median PSA in the second and third cohorts were 27.3 and 4.3 ng/ml. Between post-AA and AA failure cohorts, 149 proteins were differentially expressed. Between early and late AA failure 98 proteins were differentially expressed; 47 proteins were common in both comparisons. ELISA assays verified expression levels of 2/47 proteins in the first cohort; zinc alpha-2 macroglobulin (ZAG), and Neuropilin-2 (NPL2). Median change in ZAG decreased by 2073.5 ng/ml (post versus pre-AA) while median change in NPL2 levels increased by 2.9 ng/ml. After a median follow-up of 43 months from the post-AA time-point, 4/15 first cohort subjects had failed AA. The RR of AA failure for ZAG levels below the median change was 3.8 (95% CI: 0.4-37) and 3.0 (95% CI: 0.3-29) for NPL2.


CONCLUSIONS
A global proteomic analysis identified ZAG and NPL2 as candidate serum predictive markers of AA response which needs further validation.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Manish Kohli"", ids = ""144503041""); list(name = ""Ann L.

a2a54bf5d7b5df945cc359bb4a4660a2be896c41,Identification of Divergent Protein Domains by Combining HMM-HMM Comparisons and Co-Occurrence Detection,"Identification of protein domains is a key step for understanding protein function. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have proved to be a powerful tool for this task. The Pfam database notably provides a large collection of HMMs which are widely used for the annotation of proteins in sequenced organisms. This is done via sequence/HMM comparisons. However, this approach may lack sensitivity when searching for domains in divergent species. Recently, methods for HMM/HMM comparisons have been proposed and proved to be more sensitive than sequence/HMM approaches in certain cases. However, these approaches are usually not used for protein domain discovery at a genome scale, and the benefit that could be expected from their utilization for this problem has not been investigated. Using proteins of P. falciparum and L. major as examples, we investigate the extent to which HMM/HMM comparisons can identify new domain occurrences not already identified by sequence/HMM approaches. We show that although HMM/HMM comparisons are much more sensitive than sequence/HMM comparisons, they are not sufficiently accurate to be used as a standalone complement of sequence/HMM approaches at the genome scale. Hence, we propose to use domain co-occurrence--the general domain tendency to preferentially appear along with some favorite domains in the proteins--to improve the accuracy of the approach. We show that the combination of HMM/HMM comparisons and co-occurrence domain detection boosts protein annotations. At an estimated False Discovery Rate of 5%, it revealed 901 and 1098 new domains in Plasmodium and Leishmania proteins, respectively. Manual inspection of part of these predictions shows that it contains several domain families that were missing in the two organisms. All new domain occurrences have been integrated in the EuPathDomains database, along with the GO annotations that can be deduced.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Amel Ghouila"", ids = ""47563666""); list(name = ""Isabelle Florent"", ids = ""4995097""); list(name = ""Fatma Z.

06d4b8d014b58c1ff6809490c28dfad8d97dfb74,Consensus QSAR model for identifying novel H5N1 inhibitors,"Due to the importance of neuraminidase in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection, it has been regarded as the most important drug target for the treatment of influenza. Resistance to currently available drugs and new findings related to structure of the protein requires novel neuraminidase 1 (N1) inhibitors. In this study, a consensus QSAR model with defined applicability domain (AD) was developed using published N1 inhibitors. The consensus model was validated using an external validation set. The model achieved high sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy along with low false positive rate (FPR) and false discovery rate (FDR). The performance of model on the external validation set and training set were comparable, thus it was unlikely to be overfitted. The low FPR and low FDR will increase its accuracy in screening large chemical libraries. Screening of ZINC library resulted in 64,772 compounds as probable N1 inhibitors, while 173,674 compounds were defined to be outside the AD of the consensus model. The advantage of the current model is that it was developed using a large and diverse dataset and has a defined AD which prevents its use on compounds that it is not capable of predicting.

af405153340cd485b3b79f93587a6d1169f2c327,"Genomic Differences Between ""Primary"" and ""Secondary"" Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer as a Basis for Disparate Outcomes to Cisplatin-based Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.","BACKGROUND
Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is the standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). It is unknown whether this treatment strategy is appropriate for patients who progress to MIBC after treatment for prior noninvasive disease (secondary MIBC).


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether clinical and genomic differences exist between primary and secondary MIBC treated with NAC and RC.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Clinicopathologic outcomes were compared between 245 patients with clinical T2-4aN0M0-stage primary MIBC and 43 with secondary MIBC treated with NAC and RC at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 2001 to 2015. Genomic differences were assessed in a retrospective cohort of 385 prechemotherapy specimens sequenced by whole-exome or targeted exon capture by the Cancer Genome Atlas or at MSKCC. Findings were confirmed in an independent validation cohort of 94 MIBC patients undergoing prospective targeted exon sequencing at MSKCC.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Pathologic response rates, recurrence-free survival (RFS), bladder cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were measured. Differences in somatic genomic alteration rates were compared using Fisher's exact test and the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method.


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
Patients with secondary MIBC had lower pathologic response rates following NAC than those with primary MIBC (univariable: 26% vs 45%, multivariable: odds ratio=0.4 [95% confidence interval=0.18-0.84] p=0.02) and significantly worse RFS, CSS, and OS. Patients with secondary MIBC treated with NAC had worse CSS compared with cystectomy alone (p=0.002). In a separate genomic analysis, we detected significantly more likely deleterious somatic ERCC2 missense mutations in primary MIBC tumors in both the discovery (10.9% [36/330] vs 1.8% [1/55], p=0.04) and the validation (15.7% [12/70] vs 0% [0/24], p=0.03) cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with secondary MIBC treated with NAC had worse clinical outcomes than similarly treated patients with primary MIBC. ERCC2 mutations predicted to result in increased cisplatin sensitivity were enriched in primary versus secondary MIBC. Prospective validation is still needed, but given the lack of clinical benefit with cisplatin-based NAC in patients with secondary MIBC, upfront RC or enrollment in clinical trials should be considered.


PATIENT SUMMARY
A retrospective cohort study of patients with ""primary"" and ""secondary"" muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) treated with chemotherapy before surgical removal of the bladder identified lower response rates and shorter survival in patients with secondary MIBC. Tumor genetic sequencing of separate discovery and validation cohorts revealed that chemotherapy-sensitizing DNA damage repair gene mutations occur predominantly in primary MIBC tumors and may underlie the greater sensitivity of primary MIBC to chemotherapy. Prospective validation is still needed, but patients with secondary MIBC may derive greater benefit from upfront surgery or enrollment in clinical trials rather than from standard chemotherapy.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eugene J.

553a5811594c4765d4a7bbc72f41fdda41136796,An 8-week Controlled Feeding Trial Based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Has Minimal Effect on the Fecal Microbiota in Overweight and Obese Women (FS11-08-19).,"Objectives
To determine whether a high quality diet based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines of America (DGA) alters the composition of the fecal microbiome in individuals at risk for cardiometabolic disease, compared to a diet based on a typical American diet (TAD).


Methods
A total of 52 overweight and obese women were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, controlled feeding trial. Women were randomly assigned to the DGA or TAD group (nÂ =Â 28 DGA and 24 TAD). Diets matched each participant's estimated energy requirement and subjects remained weight-stable. The DGA diet was based on the 2010 DGA food-group recommendations, whereas the TAD diet was based on the average adult intake patterns from the NHANES 2009-2010 survey. Participants provided a stool sample 1-week prior to intervention (W0), within the second week of diet intervention (W2), and at the final week of intervention (W8). Microbial profiles were assessed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and expressed as median % relative abundance. Data analyses were performed using standardized pipelines (QIIME 1.9 and R packages). False Discovery Rate (FDR) was set at 0.2.


Results
No differences were found in Î±- and Î²-diversity indices at the operational taxomonic unit (OTU) level by diet assignment at W0, and no taxa were differentially abundant at FDRÂ <Â 0.2. Similarly, Î±- and Î²-diversity indices (OTU level) were not altered by diet within W2 or W8. A single OTU within the Ruminococcus genera was higher in TAD at both W2 (TADÂ =Â 0.014%; DGAÂ =Â 0.00%) and W8 (TADÂ =Â 0.017%; DGAÂ =Â 0.00%; FDRÂ <Â 0.05), and the Adlercreutzia genera from the Actinobacteria phyla was also higher in TAD at both W2 (TADÂ =Â 0.027%; DGAÂ =Â 0.001%) and W8 (TADÂ =Â 0.022%; DGAÂ =Â 0.002%). No within-diet differences between W0 and W2, and W0 and W8 were observed in any Î±- and Î²-diversity indices tested. When adjusting for W0 relative abundances, 10 OTUs were altered by diet at W2 and 39 OTUs were altered at W8.


Conclusions
A weight-maintaining diet based on the 2010 DGA minimally differed in the fecal microbiota compared to a weight-maintaining typical American diet. Results herein suggests differences in food-based dietary patterns does not have a large effect on the composition of the fecal microbiota in humans.

Using this ME method, we have reanalyzed the findings from a recent large genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease (CAD), incorporating biologic annotations. Our revised LFDR estimates show many large reductions in LFDR, particularly among the genetic variants belonging to annotation categories that were known to be of particular interest for CAD.

b3c311c931ecd67da9fc1f39dba0b19aea305dfe,Genome-Wide Evaluation of Epistasis with APOL1 Risk Variants in Sickle Cell Disease Nephropathy,"BACKGROUND: Two functional variants (G1 and G2) in the APOL1 gene have been implicated as contributing to the high rate of chronic kidney disease in African Americans (Genovese et al., 2010; Kopp et al., 2010). We subsequently demonstrated that the APOL1 G1 and G2 variants, as well as non-coding genetic variation in the neighboring gene MYH9, were associated with proteinuria in a cohort of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients (Ashley-Koch et al., 2011). When controlling for the effect of the functional variants in APOL1, the effect of MYH9 on proteinuria remained, suggesting that both genes were independent risk factors in SCD nephropathy. A statistical interaction between the two genes predicting glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was also observed, suggesting a possible role of epistasis. In addition, we have demonstrated that myh9 and apol1 functionally interact in an in vivo zebrafish model, particularly in the context of anemic stress and more specifically that the APOL1 G2 risk allele modulates myh9 expression in the zebrafish (Anderson et al., 2015). In an effort to identify additional genes that may interact with APOL1 to influence risk for SCD nephropathy, we have performed a genome-wide evaluation of epistasis with APOL1 G1 and G2 variants. METHODS: Adults with SCD were recruited from sickle cell centers at Duke University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Emory University, and East Carolina University. Medical history, laboratory values and DNA for genotyping were collected. GFR was estimated using the definition from the 9Modification of Diet in Renal Disease9 study (Levey et al., 1999). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and missing genotypes were imputed using IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009) with a global reference panel from the 1000 Genomes project. Principal component (PC) analysis was conducted using EIGENSOFT (Patterson et al., 2006) to obtain measures of population substructure. APOL1 coding variants G1 (rs73885319) and G2 (rs71785313) were genotyped using Taqman assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To test for interactions between each SNP and the G1 or G2 alleles, linear regression was used to predict GFR and logistic regression for proteinuria. All models included main and interaction effects of SNPs (coded additively), as well as two genome-wide PCs to control for population stratification. False discovery rate (FDR) q-values were generated using PROC MULTTEST in SAS (SAS Systems, Cary, NC). RESULTS: A region on chromosome 6 significantly interacted with the APOL1 G2 allele to predict GFR (FDR q9s 0.9). DISCUSSION: We have identified several genome-wide significant gene-gene interactions involving the APOL1 G2 allele influencing GFR in an adult SCD cohort. Although the most significant interactions were observed with intergenic regions on chromosomes 6 and 4, both regions are characterized by histone marks in ENSEMBL, indicating that they may have important regulatory function. We also observed an interaction between a SNP in CEP164 and the APOL1 G2 allele. CEP164 is a basal body protein required for assembly of the primary cilium (Graser et al., 2007), and mutations in CEP164 have been associated with nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (Chaki et al., 2012). Moreover, suppression of cep164 in the developing zebrafish resulted in a ciliopathy phenotype that included pronephric tubule cysts (Chaki et al., 2012). We did not replicate previous reports of epistasis with APOL1 in ESRD (Divers et al., 2014; Bostrom et al., 2012), but our work has shown that SCD nephropathy may be a unique form of kidney disease with distinct genetic drivers, due to the context of anemic stress (Anderson et al., 2015; Ashley-Koch et al., 2011).

d0520f11b55392c010fa048e3186b7512ef9e9e9,False Discoveries in Mutual Fund Performance: Measuring Luck in Estimated Alphas,"Standard tests designed to identify mutual funds with non-zero alphas are problematic, in that they do not adequately account for the presence of lucky funds. Lucky funds have significant estimated alphas, while their true alphas are equal to zero. To address this issue, this paper quantifies the impact of luck with new measures built on the False Discovery Rate (FDR). These FDR measures provide a simple way to compute the proportion of funds with genuine positive or negative performance as well as their location in the cross-sectional alpha distribution. Using a large cross-section of U.S. domestic-equity funds, we find that about one fifth of the funds in the population truly yield negative alphas. These funds are dispersed in the left tail of the alpha distribution. We also find a small proportion of funds with truly positive performance, which are concentrated in the extreme right tail of the alpha distribution.",2005,Economics,"list(name = ""Laurent Barras"", ids = ""12055585"");

6da5c55cfdd9beb128a3d4419b3826425d8d3df9,Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolite Pathway Analyses of Myeloma and Non-Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma Patients,"OBJECTIVE
This study attempted to identify altered metabolism and pathways related to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and myeloma patients.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this retrospective study, we collected plasma samples from 11 patients-6 healthy controls with no evidence of any blood cancers and 5 patients with either multiple myeloma (n=3) or NHL (n=2) during the preliminary study period. Samples were analyzed using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Significant features generated after statistical analyses were used for metabolomics and pathway analysis.


RESULTS
Data after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment at q=0.05 of features showed 136 for positive and 350 significant features for negative ionization mode in NHL patients as well as 262 for positive and 98 features for negative ionization mode in myeloma patients. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis determined that pathways such as steroid hormone biosynthesis, ABC transporters, and arginine and proline metabolism were affected in NHL patients. In myeloma patients, pyrimidine metabolism, carbon metabolism, and bile secretion pathways were potentially affected by the disease.


CONCLUSION
The results have shown tremendous differences in the metabolites of healthy individuals compared to myeloma and lymphoma patients. Validation through quantitative metabolomics is encouraged, especially for the metabolites with significantly expression in blood cancer patients.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Carl Angelo D Medriano"", ids = ""4718977""); list(name = ""Jinhyuk Na"", ids = ""12927779""); list(name = ""Kyung-Min Lim"", ids = ""145160369""); list(name = ""Jin-Ho Chung"", ids = ""2272898""); list(name = ""Youngja Hwang Park"", ids = ""46797022"")",4a5a802c9e549880927a7677d630ded9bce79389; 9fddc6acf334d861f85316c4c31a07d533efa740; f99d878493b2f449fad8d89898dfdb089e3f75f2; 7afa96c57801f84186634713c81a555408d6c009,57493863c3bce123a83bdaa10ed92dfde43b2c2e; 5ad07b197bddbe7c639b8202a77011f37810a13b; a4ec5cbb855b0e8e1f9ae66235e8423b8df33ece; ceaa55fc43e0db971a49ecf6207f5f1356bd8e70; dc80855a435f8347c62fdea0c328ff452e51fcd7; 977a8210b92131d757714b1cf5422fee39593357; d0d8b4b288daa1f88cd70e39cf4a68a1eb36aeff; 052032cd0ddce9634d648524286853f55ec50492; 02ff401d15912b92acb237eb9e50d58a432c7c33; 14c31d66351b46b4e2d170d24da1554b31689101; c03563b5d9fa1701e1faf1b55c6fa7e94653fdb0; d750da1b2dfd574633b2c8c6d4d2ea297b185327; 484768fca6e27eb58a9e31acc909ef9aab1d8554; 912c4de9fad527587ae3013ff38c9b7d89fdbfd4; 505e8cf4c90207d52c19332930ae7c8ed1fb17a8; 2b2bfc84b8941714ed68fa8dbfb388349124e7ce; f70b2b0660f3a65f241f9e391c81aedfc52788e1; 9865f6cd19a0231c58bb26b5f9f783c5106dc940; 0a3e7b2a03e386dd560caade04337e7ff06ccdf2; 0917c861052788dc37c19aa6f42f1d07111be183; 6f04619526929d9741f66f275fd323f9942396f5; ee2feea49e8bf6642bf56e2ee94f0e1dafc24ac0; ce8a00d23c48cff49a63a81e4c1af3149a3a67d5; 3b17c237eb939a35687bd5c14175c530f2d18a00; ff3918e09bf0369492ac5201404f6ad1754d13ba; 7178c5b010c495eac20752c4a5253910ecf5f716; 9463b015e0552f9d5f39c79b801222262862e5b7; 433a42fb2d6113abefb208bae5d205a9e4220877; 2660323d864317a5233c86e3c16f1499ba70af99; 3beb51a03910d50daf077e6f0f504dd51f787616; 686fd6f916b56be52b0de03fc505430e4fa4b9f5; 7937d3487d08fb2a7ede33149a586feeb2e2d7aa; 308432fbf69d635aff347a151d7edbc359293590; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 179121bcfced0a595e96e0d55d311875607dba86; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; 194be065ac6e3c4a3bf7e4ddf7240a26d5469469; 6d88fcb13f9ad6bdce2b797e63633c34d201034d; ec18289446c8d300d3ac1e8dbce8b81baf2ca00a; bf281cf420d5983aa948b033aa303a2f8a1ce27f; f36428cf6d0a9392041b4e397d2a408d21138367; 6906ef0c1fe45571640c3c7a6b3c9c2d9a979a64; 86246922d63487f8a0b43c0a940eb7928b132391; c71445ae2437460c365ec194463bd73fdba43299; 82db95c90d5fb3bbf1455e582bab0844a9c47c8f,Cell Journal (Yakhteh),19,44 - 54
db1effe5c9e084a8a6af62cc526c1298d38bb927,Data-driven queries between medications and spontaneous preterm birth among 2.5 million pregnancies.,"BACKGROUND
Our goal was to develop an approach that can systematically identify potential associations between medication prescribed in pregnancy and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) by mining large administrative ""claims"" databases containing hundreds of medications. One such association that we illustrate emerged with antiviral medications used for herpes treatment.


METHODS
IBM MarketScanÂ® databases (2007-2016) were used. A pregnancy cohort was established using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9/10) codes. Multiple hypothesis testing and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure that limited false discovery rate at 5% revealed, among 863 medications, five that showed odds ratios (ORs) <1. The statistically strongest was an association between antivirals and sPTB that we illustrate as a real example of our approach, specifically for treatment of genital herpes (GH). Three groups of women were identified based on diagnosis of GH and treatment during the first 36â€‰weeks of pregnancy: (a) GH without treatment; (b) GH treated with antivirals; (c) no GH or treatment.


RESULTS
We identified 2,538,255 deliveries. 0.98% women had a diagnosis of GH. Among them, 60.0% received antiviral treatment. Women with treated GH had ORâ€‰<â€‰1, (OR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.85, 0.98]). In contrast, women with untreated GH had a small increased risk of sPTB (OR [95% CI] =1.22 [1.14, 1.32]).


CONCLUSIONS
Data-driven approaches can effectively generate new hypotheses on associations between medications and sPTB. This analysis led us to examine the association with GH treatment. While unknown confounders may impact these findings, our results indicate that women with untreated GH have a modest increased risk of sPTB.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ivana MariÄ‡"", ids = ""47091042""); list(name = ""Virginia D.

The different mechanisms of lymphomagenesis however, remain unknown. Global analysis of proteins expressed in the different subtypes may provide insights into biologic, pathogenetic, and molecular differences. Objectives: To compare the proteomic expression profile and signal transduction pathways of EBV+ eBL with EBV+/- sBL and EBV+/- normal B-cells. Normal B-cells (EBV+/-) were isolated from leukopacks obtained from the NY Blood Center using Magnetic Cell Sorting CD20 MicroBeads (Miltenyi biotec, CA). Whole cell lysates obtained from EBV+ eBL Raji, EBV+ sBL NC37, EBV- sBL Ramos, and EBVÂ± B-cells were digested and labeled with iTRAQ reagents. The peptides were resolved by 2D-LC technique. MS/MS spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap XL Tandem Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher). MS/MS data was searched using X! Tandem TPP software against human IPI database (v3.50) appended with decoy sequences. iTRAQ ratios of proteins (ProteinProphet probability of >0.9) were normalized and differentially expressed proteins were selected for further analysis. Over 400 proteins were identified; 827 binary differential protein expressions were established with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Nader Kim El-Mallawany"", ids = ""1397643672""); list(name = ""Janet Ayello"", ids = ""4813559""); list(name = ""Nancy S.

CF is characterized by repeated lung infections leading to respiratory failure. Using a high-throughput method, we developed a T7 phage display cDNA library derived from mRNA isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and leukocytes of sarcoidosis patients. This library was biopanned to obtain 1070 potential antigens. A microarray platform was constructed and immunoscreened with sera from healthy (nâ€‰=â€‰49), lung cancer (LC) (nâ€‰=â€‰31) and CF (nâ€‰=â€‰31) subjects. We built 1,000 naÃ¯ve Bayes models on the training sets. We selected the top 20 frequently significant clones ranked with student t-test discriminating CF antigens from healthy controls and LC at a False Discovery Rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.01. The performances of the models were validated on an independent validation set. The mean of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the classifiers was 0.973 with a sensitivity of 0.999 and specificity of 0.959. Finally, we identified CF specific clones that correlate highly with sweat chloride test, BMI, and FEV1% predicted values. For the first time, we show that CF specific serological biomarkers can be identified through immunocreenings of a T7 phage display library with high accuracy, which may have utility in development of molecular therapy.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Harvinder S.

We studied 49 subjects, 17 with cervical dystonia, 18 with blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia, and 79 healthy controls. We performed a whole group analysis, followed by a subgroup analysis. We used Freesurfer software to measure cortical thickness, subcortical volume and to perform a primary exploratory analysis in the craniocervical dystonia group, complemented by a region of interest analysis. We also performed a secondary analysis, with data generated from Freesurfer for subgroups, corrected by false discovery rate. We then performed an exploratory generalized linear model with significant areas for the previous steps using clinical features as independent variables.


RESULTS
The primary exploratory analysis demonstrated atrophy in visual processing regions in craniocervical dystonia. The secondary analysis demonstrated atrophy in motor, sensory, and visual regions in blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia, as well as in limbic regions in cervical dystonia. Cervical dystonia patients also had greater cortical thickness than blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia patients in frontal pole and medial orbitofrontal regions. Finally, we observed an association between precuneus, age of onset of dystonia and age at the MRI exam, in craniocervical dystonia; between motor and limbic regions and age at the exam, clinical score and time on botulinum toxin in cervical dystonia and sensory regions and age of onset and time on botulinum toxin in blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia.


CONCLUSIONS
We detected involvement of visual processing regions in craniocervical dystonia, and a pattern of involvement in cervical dystonia and blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia, including motor, sensory and limbic areas. We also showed an association of cortical thickness atrophy and younger onset age, older age at the MRI exam, higher clinical score and an uncertain association with longer time on botulinum toxin.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Larissa Vilany"", ids = ""23221912""); list(name = ""Thiago Junqueira Ribeiro de Rezende"", ids = ""5704754""); list(name = ""Luiza Gonzaga Piovesana"", ids = ""5854385""); list(name = ""Lidiane Soares Campos"", ids = ""39677858""); list(name = ""Paula C de Azevedo"", ids = ""24457899""); list(name = ""FÃ¡bio R.

c31482c9962cab74d8dd0da2561298130b5c1fb8,Analyzing circadian expression data by harmonic regression based on autoregressive spectral estimation,"MOTIVATION
Circadian rhythms are prevalent in most organisms. Identification of circadian-regulated genes is a crucial step in discovering underlying pathways and processes that are clock-controlled. Such genes are largely detected by searching periodic patterns in microarray data. However, temporal gene expression profiles usually have a short time-series with low sampling frequency and high levels of noise. This makes circadian rhythmic analysis of temporal microarray data very challenging.


RESULTS
We propose an algorithm named ARSER, which combines time domain and frequency domain analysis for extracting and characterizing rhythmic expression profiles from temporal microarray data. ARSER employs autoregressive spectral estimation to predict an expression profile's periodicity from the frequency spectrum and then models the rhythmic patterns by using a harmonic regression model to fit the time-series. ARSER describes the rhythmic patterns by four parameters: period, phase, amplitude and mean level, and measures the multiple testing significance by false discovery rate q-value. When tested on well defined periodic and non-periodic short time-series data, ARSER was superior to two existing and widely-used methods, COSOPT and Fisher's G-test, during identification of sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal periodic patterns in short, noisy and non-stationary time-series. Finally, analysis of Arabidopsis microarray data using ARSER led to identification of a novel set of previously undetected non-sinusoidal periodic transcripts, which may lead to new insights into molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms.

We performed a genome-wide transmission disequilibrium test analysis of a newly genotyped autism case-parent triad samples (127 trios) in Han Chinese, identified top association signals at multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs9839376 (OR = 2.59, P = 1.27 Ã—â€‰10-05 ) at KCNMB2, rs6044680 (OR = 0.319, P = 4.82 Ã—â€‰10-05 ) and rs7274133 (OR = 0.313, P = 3.22 Ã—â€‰10-05 ) at PCSK2, and rs310619 (OR = 2.40, P = 7.44 Ã—â€‰10-05 ) at EEF1A2. Furthermore, a genome-wide combined P-value of individual SNPs in two independent case-parent triad samples (total 402 triads, n = 1,206) identified SNPs at EGFLAM, ZDHHC2, AGBL1, and SNX29 as additional association signals for autism. While none of these signals achieved a genome-wide significance in the two samples of our study, they have been reported in a previous genome-wide association study of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the majority of these SNP have a significant cis-regulatory association with mRNA in human tissues (False discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05).

584904ce6a03c6ce259ea5f8e7773480f452ddc8,A Quantitative CT Imaging Signature Predicts Survival and Complements Established Prognosticators in Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"PURPOSE
Prognostic biomarkers are needed to guide the management of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This work aims to develop an image-based prognostic signature and assess its complementary value to existing biomarkers.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
We retrospectively analyzed data of stage I NSCLC in 8 cohorts.Â On the basis of an analysis of 39 computed tomography (CT) features characterizing tumor and its relation to neighboring pleura, we developed a prognostic signature in an institutional cohort (nÂ =Â 117) and tested it in an external cohort (nÂ =Â 88).Â A third cohort of 89 patients with CT and gene expression data was used to create a surrogate genomic signature of the imaging signature. We conducted further validation using data from 5 gene expression cohorts (nÂ =Â 639) and built a composite signature by integrating with the cell-cycle progression (CCP) score and clinical variables.


RESULTS
An imaging signature consisting of a pleural contact index and normalized inverse difference was significantly associated with overall survival in both imaging cohorts (PÂ =Â .0005 and PÂ =Â .0009). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes highly correlated with the imaging signature were related to immune response, such as lymphocyte activation and chemotaxis (false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05). A genomic surrogate of the imaging signature remained a significant predictor of survival when we adjusted for known prognostic factors (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-2.44; PÂ <Â .0001) and stratified patients within subgroups as defined by stage, histology, or CCP score. A composite signature outperformed the genomic surrogate, CCP score, and clinical model alone (PÂ <Â .01) regarding concordance index (0.70 vs 0.62-0.63).


CONCLUSIONS
The proposed CT imaging signature reflects fundamental biological differences in tumors and predicts overall survival in patients with stage I NSCLC. When combined with established prognosticators, the imaging signature improves survival prediction.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Juheon Lee"", ids = ""46663632""); list(name = ""Bailiang Li"", ids = ""48218879""); list(name = ""Yi Cui"", ids = ""144241784""); list(name = ""Xiaoli Sun"", ids = ""49816442""); list(name = ""Jia Wu"", ids = ""153171673""); list(name = ""Hong Zhu"", ids = ""145305949""); list(name = ""Jinming Yu"", ids = ""22171164""); list(name = ""Michael Francis Gensheimer"", ids = ""6529872""); list(name = ""Billy W.

6f787fbaa907055e1c60014017e5ec624c0f22c8,Key Glycolytic Metabolites in Paralyzed Skeletal Muscle Are Altered Seven Days after Spinal Cord Injury in Mice.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in rapid muscle atrophy and an oxidative-to-glycolytic fiber-type shift. Those with chronic SCI are more at risk for developing insulin resistance and reductions in glucose clearance than able-bodied individuals, but how glucose metabolism is affected after SCI is not well known. An untargeted metabolomics approach was utilized to investigate changes in whole-muscle metabolites at an acute (7-day) and subacute (28-day) time frame after a complete T9 spinal cord transection in 20-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Two hundred one metabolites were detected in all samples, and 83 had BinBase IDs. A principal components analysis showed the 7-day group as a unique cluster. Further, 36 metabolites were altered after 7- and/or 28-day post-SCI (p values <0.05), with 12 passing further false discovery rate exclusion criteria; of those 12 metabolites, three important glycolytic molecules-glucose and downstream metabolites pyruvic acid and lactic acid-were reduced at 7 days compared to those values in sham and/or 28-day animals. These changes were associated with altered expression of proteins associated with glycolysis, as well as monocarboxylate transporter 4 gene expression. Taken together, our data suggest an acute disruption of skeletal muscle glucose uptake at 7 days post-SCI, which leads to reduced pyruvate and lactate levels. These levels recover by 28 days post-SCI, but a reduction in pyruvate dehydrogenase protein expression at 28 days post-SCI implies disruption in downstream oxidation of glucose.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zachary A Graham"", ids = ""3946547""); list(name = ""Jacob A Siedlik"", ids = ""50482668""); list(name = ""Lauren M.

0a71f3423d30c93442bee61574753b8ae03e73fa,Bariatric Surgery Induces Disruption in Inflammatory Signaling Pathways Mediated by Immune Cells in Adipose Tissue: A RNA-Seq Study,"BACKGROUND
Bariatric surgery is associated to improvements in obesity-associated comorbidities thought to be mediated by a decrease of adipose inflammation. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these beneficial effects are poorly understood.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We analyzed RNA-seq expression profiles in adipose tissue from 22 obese women before and 3 months after surgery. Of 15,972 detected genes, 1214 were differentially expressed after surgery at a 5% false discovery rate. Upregulated genes were mostly involved in the basal cellular machinery. Downregulated genes were enriched in metabolic functions of adipose tissue. At baseline, 26 modules of coexpressed genes were identified. The four most stable modules reflected the innate and adaptive immune responses of adipose tissue. A first module reflecting a non-specific signature of innate immune cells, mainly macrophages, was highly conserved after surgery with the exception of DUSP2 and CD300C. A second module reflected the adaptive immune response elicited by T lymphocytes; after surgery, a disconnection was observed between genes involved in T-cell signaling and mediators of the signal transduction such as CXCR1, CXCR2, GPR97, CCR7 and IL7R. A third module reflected neutrophil-mediated inflammation; after surgery, several genes were dissociated from the module, including S100A8, S100A12, CD300E, VNN2, TUBB1 and FAM65B. We also identified a dense network of 19 genes involved in the interferon-signaling pathway which was strongly preserved after surgery, with the exception of DDX60, an antiviral factor involved in RIG-I-mediated interferon signaling. A similar loss of connection was observed in lean mice compared to their obese counterparts.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
These results suggest that improvements of the inflammatory state following surgery might be explained by a disruption of immuno-inflammatory cascades involving a few crucial molecules which could serve as potential therapeutic targets.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christine Poitou"", ids = ""5726042""); list(name = ""Claire Perret"", ids = ""50363134""); list(name = ""FranÃ§ois Mathieu"", ids = ""50371540""); list(name = ""Vinh Truong"", ids = ""148323679""); list(name = ""Yuna Blum"", ids = ""50225757""); list(name = ""HervÃ© Durand"", ids = ""122338581""); list(name = ""Rohia Alili"", ids = ""4826732""); list(name = ""Nadjim Chelghoum"", ids = ""3279346""); list(name = ""VÃ©ronique Pelloux"", ids = ""3751386""); list(name = ""Judith Aron-Wisnewsky"", ids = ""1397478545""); list(name = ""Adriana Torcivia"", ids = ""4927248""); list(name = ""Jean-Luc Bouillot"", ids = ""2632240""); list(name = ""Brian W.

Here, we present Allelome.PRO, an automated user-friendly bioinformatics pipeline, which uses high-throughput sequencing data from reciprocal crosses of two genetically distinct mouse strains to detect allele-specific expression and chromatin modifications. Allelome.PRO extends approaches used in previous studies that exclusively analyzed imprinted expression to give a complete picture of the 'allelome' by automatically categorising the allelic expression of all genes in a given cell type into imprinted, strain-biased, biallelic or non-informative. Allelome.PRO offers increased sensitivity to analyze lowly expressed transcripts, together with a robust false discovery rate empirically calculated from variation in the sequencing data. We used RNA-seq data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts from F1 reciprocal crosses to determine a biologically relevant allelic ratio cutoff, and define for the first time an entire allelome. Furthermore, we show that Allelome.PRO detects differential enrichment of H3K4me3 over promoters from ChIP-seq data validating the RNA-seq results. This approach can be easily extended to analyze histone marks of active enhancers, or transcription factor binding sites and therefore provides a powerful tool to identify candidate cis regulatory elements genome wide.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Daniel Andergassen"", ids = ""3954806""); list(name = ""Christoph P.

050e1ac08ae3341717278bdfe53e8e02d01368c9,Sample size calculations for the differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data using a negative binomial regression model,"Abstract High throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology is increasingly used in disease-related biomarker studies. A negative binomial distribution has become the popular choice for modeling read counts of genes in RNA-seq data due to over-dispersed read counts. In this study, we propose two explicit sample size calculation methods for RNA-seq data using a negative binomial regression model. To derive these new sample size formulas, the common dispersion parameter and the size factor as an offset via a natural logarithm link function are incorporated. A two-sided Wald test statistic derived from the coefficient parameter is used for testing a single gene at a nominal significance level 0.05 and multiple genes at a false discovery rate 0.05. The variance for the Wald test is computed from the variance-covariance matrix with the parameters estimated from the maximum likelihood estimates under the unrestricted and constrained scenarios. The performance and a side-by-side comparison of our new formulas with three existing methods with a Wald test, a likelihood ratio test or an exact test are evaluated via simulation studies. Since other methods are much computationally extensive, we recommend our M1 method for quick and direct estimation of sample sizes in an experimental design. Finally, we illustrate sample sizes estimation using an existing breast cancer RNA-seq data.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaohong Li"", ids = ""48569896""); list(name = ""Dongfeng Wu"", ids = ""48198431""); list(name = ""Nigel G.

50f087a7e8665dab3a87c8bd33e41a5668b6a3d6,Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Multiple Testing,"Motivated by the problems in genomics, astronomy and some other emerging fields, multiple hypothesis testing has come to the forefront of statistical research in the recent years. In the context of multiple testing, new error measures such as the false discovery rate (FDR) occupy important roles comparable to the role of type I error in classical hypothesis testing. Assuming that a random mechanism decides the truth of a hypothesis, substantial gain in power is possible by estimating error measures from the data. Nonparametric Bayesian approaches are proven to be particularly suitable for estimation of error measure in multiple testing situation. A Bayesian approach based on a nonparametric mixture model for p-values can utilize special features of the distribution of p-values that significantly improves the quality of estimation. In this paper we describe the nonparametric Bayesian modeling exercise of the distribution of the p-values. We begin with a brief review of Bayesian nonparametric concepts of Dirichlet process and Dirichlet mixtures and classical multiple hypothesis testing. We then review recently proposed nonparametric Bayesian methods for estimating errors based on a Dirichlet mixture of prior for the p-value density. When the test statistics are independent, a mixture of beta kernels can adequately model the p-value density, whereas in the dependent case one can consider a Dirichlet mixture of multivariate skew-normal kernel prior for probit transforms of",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Subhashis Ghosal"", ids = ""2291789""); list(name = ""Anindya Roy"", ids = ""3155262""); list(name = ""Raleigh Nc"", ids = ""73038716"")",bc0003eff7c1b6ccfd95d33758fc174b290122eb,4ba039d59d137726a98e355ce2aeb327a7473ee7; db9074739152cb9ebd8fc5ae0dea9405f62c5087; f2f192cf5412ad21b193a25b417413ec88e45234; 3d6221fa36c387b0e4bd1e4b789174983296805e; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 4b5dabdecc0e17fad08c05d36e0a557727afe4e3; e1ba33f56f75c40aed15538073e377c23f4013da; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; 0d99b581fb132b6b0c96c17d2099e484b9853e79; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f4890345d1f0547606508185cf65d49613fbd423; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; 95c9bb4fb5d2027f7f7f97aaacd7ec83509cd1fa; 10ab0830336e3b204202f47aa0fb63a813e3dc71; 3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 59370f88a21383172949c7798204cc4a80bcf323; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; f34b210c30ca9e1e4c7fa1c3edff9c028883bdc3; b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; e584de769fd8693652736182e3a8d099e659e788; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; b18c4aa130246575346877529afa57c39656026e; 13d05a474040c13441503538205011d0fa8ccf85; 8e011baa648ce7cb89c1bab9c59313502c862251; 8157dc13d97308dc8903a62176ecb60f8dd4e142; 08401cd7b944057a654147cc70c9df1cf93005bd; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 46dbbd9677f3de4ed792cdb8b77a523945faca52; 84dca92e839864988a56c439bb7e4f94adebf7b0; fb9f2083c9299bf5ba249f81e991decdff831ce5; 263f103fd2bfbbd6aeb392c6519d3f590e647c0a; 2356da239d3827bdea639c1b012edb0022d8f203; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 532b124209dab8f27f5e89ad89d50730bd457dda; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; 17094ab0b2718eacf62a7b96a5b3f725a956f7a5; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; df25adb36860c1ad9edaac04b8855a2f19e79c5b; ef45d25511f0c0543b1e71047f9b311a415a9a3c; a03e6e5b81637b34f9a9a446f0a3158a64befe96; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 380f7bf31b898ace68caa597340e39e65926a87e; f327a3ec3fd438aa8760c0eccac4b7f79d267b7b; a7e66d7436849cbd19e6991d2c4d06fb06580a79; 9797e85faff24278e312a9f371608025219879ff; c91a14f5a1f3d588c08e9db47093da3cf1c0a493; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d,,,
08d9aebbdeee2ec0e062c3d4237f6ac58533d199,Generalized Mannâ€“Whitney Type Tests for Microarray Experiments,"type=""main"" xml:id=""sjos12055-abs-0001""> New statistical procedures are introduced to analyse typical microRNA expression data sets. For each separate microRNA expression, the null hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference between the distributions of the expression in different groups. The test statistics are then constructed having certain type of alternatives in mind. To avoid strong (parametric) distributional assumptions, the alternatives are formulated using probabilities of different orders of pairs or triples of observations coming from different groups, and the test statistics are then constructed using corresponding several-sample U-statistics, natural estimates of these probabilities. Classical several-sample rank test statistics, such as the Kruskalâ€“Wallis and Jonckheereâ€“Terpstra tests, are special cases in our approach. Also, as the number of variables (microRNAs) is huge, we confront a serious simultaneous testing problem. Different approaches to control the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate are shortly discussed, and it is shown how the Chenâ€“Stein theorem can be used to show that family-wise error rate can be controlled for cluster-dependent microRNAs under weak assumptions. The theory is illustrated with an analysis of real data, a microRNA expression data set on Finnish (aggressive and non-aggressive) prostate cancer patients and their controls.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Daniel Fischer"", ids = ""144541097""); list(name = ""Hannu Oja"", ids = ""33985559""); list(name = ""Johanna Schleutker"", ids = ""5065738""); list(name = ""Pranab Kumar Sen"", ids = ""1731053""); list(name = ""Tiina Wahlfors"", ids = ""50719167"")",9f622c02bba18c42cb7f9d1d7fde492d168fcfab; 65cb0bfa3a632421afd4cb81d09e992cb7118742; 8455943606f3ace75cbbe4360f0bee970abab09c; 75c8dada124cf663a5b5dd2923ce91de92c809cb; 83ee47c58b780a93734b28b30c28b40bafcd3fae; e428a8f89fa3b9bc7a0f1ae511d82c042fc757be,,Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,41,672-692

Nonetheless, selection of an optimal statistical method can be challenging when different methods generate inconsistent results from the same data set.ResultsWe compared six statistical approaches relevant to DNA methylation microarray analysis in terms of false discovery rate control, statistical power, and stability through simulation studies and real data examples. Observable differences were noticed between Î² values and M values only when methylation levels were correlated across CpG loci. For small sample size (n=3 or 6 in each group), both the empirical Bayes and bump hunting methods showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG loci were independent. Only the bump hunting method showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG sites were correlated. For medium (n=12 in each group) and large sample sizes (n=24 in each group), all methods compared had similar power, except for the permutation test whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was low. For all sample sizes, the bump hunting method had the lowest stability in terms of standard deviation of total discoveries whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was large. The apparent test power comparisons based on raw p-values from DNA methylation studies on ovarian cancer and rheumatoid arthritis provided results as consistent as those obtained in the simulation studies. Overall, these results provide guidance for optimal statistical methods selection under different scenarios.ConclusionsFor DNA methylation studies with small sample size, the bump hunting method and the empirical Bayes method are recommended when DNA methylation levels across CpG loci are independent, while only the bump hunting method is recommended when DNA methylation levels are correlated across CpG loci. All methods are acceptable for medium or large sample sizes.",2015,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dongmei Li"", ids = ""1764239""); list(name = ""Zidian Xie"", ids = ""3151975""); list(name = ""Marc Pape"", ids = ""34682245""); list(name = ""Timothy D.

739d31b5cfded05c251e7c78381b23f0025042a5,Genome-wide co-expression based prediction of differential expressions,"MOTIVATION
Microarrays have been widely used for medical studies to detect novel disease-related genes. They enable us to study differential gene expressions at a genomic level. They also provide us with informative genome-wide co-expressions. Although many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying differentially expressed genes, genome-wide co-expressions have not been well considered for this issue. Incorporating genome-wide co-expression information in the differential expression analysis may improve the detection of disease-related genes.


RESULTS
In this study, we proposed a statistical method for predicting differential expressions through the local regression between differential expression and co-expression measures. The smoother span parameter was determined by optimizing the rank correlation between the observed and predicted differential expression measures. A mixture normal quantile-based method was used to transform data. We used the gene-specific permutation procedure to evaluate the significance of a prediction. Two published microarray data sets were analyzed for applications. For the data set collected for a prostate cancer study, the proposed method identified many genes with weak differential expressions. Several of these genes have been shown in literature to be associated with the disease. For the data set collected for a type 2 diabetes study, no significant genes could be identified by the traditional methods. However, the proposed method identified many genes with significantly low false discovery rates.

6ac5b0dd948a3cc879c38db98aa28a1cd034d593,Source Analysis of Alpha Rhythm Reactivity Using LORETA Imaging with 64-Channel EEG and Individual MRI,"Conventional EEG and quantitative EEG visual stimuli (close-open eyes) reactivity analysis have shown their usefulness in clinical practice; however studies at the level of EEG generators are limited. The focus of the study was visual reactivity of cortical resources in healthy subjects and in a stroke patient. The 64 channel EEG and T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were obtained from 32 healthy subjects and a middle cerebral artery stroke patient. Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) was used to estimate EEG sources for both close eyes (CE) vs. open eyes (OE) conditions using individual MRI. The t-test was performed between source spectra of the two conditions. Thresholds for statistically significant t values were estimated by the local false discovery rate (lfdr) method. The Z transform was used to quantify the differences in cortical reactivity between the patient and healthy subjects. Closed-open eyes alpha reactivity sources were found mainly in posterior regions (occipito-parietal zones), extended in some cases to anterior and thalamic regions. Significant cortical reactivity sources were found in frequencies different from alpha (lower t-values). Significant changes at EEG reactivity sources were evident in the damaged brain hemisphere. Reactivity changes were also found in the â€œhealthyâ€ hemisphere when compared with the normal population. In conclusion, our study of brain sources of EEG alpha reactivity provides information that is not evident in the usual topographic analysis.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""E Cuspineda"", ids = ""4707031""); list(name = ""Calixto Machado"", ids = ""152221466""); list(name = ""Trinidad Virues"", ids = ""5713277""); list(name = ""Eduardo MartÃ­nez-Montes"", ids = ""1393670163""); list(name = ""A Ojeda"", ids = ""83167125""); list(name = ""P A ValdÃ©s"", ids = ""145154023""); list(name = ""Jorge E.

La metodologia mas utilizada para mapear dichas variantes comprende los denominados estudios de asociacion genetica. Dichos estudios persiguen la identificacion de marcadores geneticos asociados a un rasgo o enfermedad de interes en una poblacion dada. El enorme avance tecnologico logrado en la ultima decada tanto en el analisis de ADN como en el conocimiento del genoma humano, ha supuesto un cambio drastico en el diseno y desarrollo de los estudios de asociacion. En funcion del numero de polimorfismos analizados y de la hipotesis de partida podremos diferenciar entre estudios de asociacion basados en genes candidatos o estudios de rastreo completo del genoma o GWAS. El analisis de genes candidatos ha sido sin duda el abordaje mas extendido en los estudios de asociacion realizados en las dos ultimas decadas. En dichos estudios, la seleccion de genes se realiza en base al conocimiento de las vias moleculares implicadas en el desarrollo de la enfermedad, a estudios de ligamiento y/o estudios de expresion genica. En la presente tesis doctoral nos planteamos evaluar los metodos estadisticos aplicados en estudios de asociacion genetica disenados para la identificacion de factores ambientales y geneticos implicados en la susceptibilidad y pronostico del cancer gastrico en nuestro medio.
Metodologia: Los articulos presentados en esta tesis se basan en un estudio multicentrico nacional, realizado entre los anos 2002 y 2010 en el que se captaron de forma consecutiva pacientes diagnosticados de CG primario en una red de hospitales integrados en el Sistema Nacional de Salud. A dichos pacientes se les realizo el seguimiento de su evolucion hasta noviembre de 2013. Como poblacion control se reclutaron voluntarios sanos sin sintomatologia gastrointestinal procedentes del banco de sangre (donantes sanos) o bien de los servicios de consultas externas y fueron emparejados con los casos por sexo, edad (Â± 5 anos) y area de residencia. En el articulo 3 de la presente tesis se incluyeron en el estudio, ademas de pacientes con CG, pacientes con ulcera duodenal atendidos en el Hospital Clinico Universitario de Zaragoza.
Los articulos abordan dos metodologias claramente diferenciadas en cuanto al tipo de poblacion analizada en los estudios de asociacion, como son los estudios caso-control y los estudios de cohortes. Mediante el diseno caso-control de individuos no relacionados hemos evaluado la influencia de los polimorfismos objeto de estudio en la susceptibilidad y el fenotipo del GC asi como las interacciones con factores ambientales. Por su parte, el diseno de cohortes nos ha permitido analizar la influencia de los factores geneticos y ambientales en el pronostico de la enfermedad, considerando la supervivencia general del paciente desde el momento del diagnostico del CG como variable fundamental. La eleccion de un tipo de diseno u otro influye de forma determinante en el analisis estadistico de los datos.
En los estudios de susceptibilidad genetica en CG el analisis individual de SNPs es el primer analisis que se lleva a cabo tras comprobar el cumplimiento del HWE en la poblacion control. Los analisis de asociacion deben de ajustarse ademas por una serie de factores potenciales que podrian generar confusion en la asociacion obtenida como son la infeccion por H. pylori, el consumo de tabaco y la existencia de antecedentes familiares de CG. En este sentido, los modelos de regresion logistica representan una metodologia estadistica apropiada para analizar el grado de asociacion de los diferentes SNPs teniendo en cuenta el efecto de otras variables. Los modelos de regresion logistica se han utilizado en los analisis realizados en los articulos 1, 3 y 4 de esta tesis.
En los estudios de factores pronostico, ademas del analisis individual de SNPs mediante el estimador de Kaplan-Meier, se ha evaluado el efecto simultaneo de una serie de variables o factores pronosticos sobre el tiempo de supervivencia utilizando para ello el modelo de riesgos proporcionales o modelo de Cox. En los articulos 2 y 3 de la presente tesis se han aplicado modelos de regresion de Cox univariante y multivariante como complemento a las curvas de Kaplan-Meier.
Junto con el estudio de haplotipos, los modelos de regresion constituyen el principal abordaje en el analisis de multiples SNPs. Tambien representan excelentes herramientas para el analisis de interacciones gen-gen o gen-ambiente. En el articulo 1 de la tesis se realizo el analisis de interacciones entre los polimorfismos de las isoformas GST y las variables ambientales habito tabaquico, infeccion por H. pylori e historia familiar de CG. En el articulo 2 se evaluaron interacciones gen-ambiente, e interacciones gen-gen de los 23 polimorfismos estudiados. En relacion al software utilizado, el analisis estadistico de los datos se realizo, en su mayoria, con el programa estadistico IBM SPSS StatisticsÂ® para Windows. Sin embargo, para el analisis de los datos geneticos del articulo 4 en el que se analizan 108 SNPs, apostamos por la utilizacion de los paquetes implementados en el programa R de libre distribucion. Ademas del analisis descriptivo de los datos, el analisis exploratorio de los valores perdidos, el calculo del HWE o la correccion de comparaciones multiples, el paquete SNPassoc nos permitio realizar analisis crudos, ajustados, estratificado, analisis de subconjuntos e incluso analisis de interacciones. Para el analisis de haplotipos en el articulo 4, nos decantamos por el paquete haplo.stats tambien disponible en R. Existen otros programas para la estimacion de haplotipos como el software Estimating Haplotype frequencies (EH), el cual fue utilizado para el analisis de haplotipos en el articulo 2. 
Conclusiones: La realizacion de la presente tesis doctoral nos ha permitido reconocer los principales problemas de los estudios de asociacion genetica como son los tamanos muestrales insuficientes, la dificultad para identificar variantes alelicas de baja frecuencia y la obtencion de falsos positivos por estratificacion de la poblacion o sesgos en el grupo control. Uno de los problemas mas debatidos en los estudios de asociacion es el que hace referencia a las comparaciones multiples. La correccion por comparaciones multiples se realiza para controlar el conjunto de hipotesis y evitar falsas asociaciones que pudieran atribuirse al azar. El procedimiento mas conocido es el metodo de Bonferroni, sin embargo este metodo es demasiado conservador y por ello se han planteado en este trabajo valores menos extremos como el False Discovery Rate (FDR).
Tambien hemos observado que los modelos de regresion pueden resultar ineficientes cuando el numero de SNPs analizados es muy elevado, en cuyo caso deberian aplicarse otros modelos mas complejos que requieren un conocimiento avanzado tanto de metodologia estadistica como de computacion. Por ultimo, destacar el importante coste computacional propio de los estudios de asociacion genetica, y es que el analisis estadistico debe considerar el analisis individual de cada SNP y los cinco posibles modelos de herencia genetica. Actualmente, en nuestro entorno, se esta trabajando en la integracion de informacion de distintas fuentes y en el tratamiento de grandes bases de datos. Todo ello permitira disponer, en un futuro no lejano, de una infraestructura de alta capacidad y rendimiento que facilite el desarrollo de estudios mas complejos.",2017,Philosophy,"list(name = ""Patricia Carrera Lasfuentes"", ids = ""77211332"")",,,,,1
19ebaa6200f7a7d2dfaa8e5bfee3e34b347041a3,Implication of the suberin pathway in adaptation to waterlogging and hypertrophied lenticels formation in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.).,"Waterlogging causes stressful conditions for perennial species. The temporary overabundance of water in waterlogged soil can induce hypoxia in the rhizosphere, leading to root death, tree decline and even dieback. Two closely related members of the European white oak complex, pedunculate (Quercus robur L.) and sessile (Quercus petraea Matt. Liebl.) oaks, have different ecological characteristics, especially regarding their adaptation to soil waterlogging. The tolerance of waterlogging observed in pedunculate oak is driven principally by its ability to produce adaptive structures, hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots, and to switch rapidly its metabolism to the fermentative pathway. This study had two objectives: (i) to identify genes important for adaptation to waterlogging and (ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in hypertrophied lenticel formation in pedunculate oak. We subjected seedlings of the two species to hypoxia by maintaining the water level 2â€…cm above the collar. The immersed part of the stem (i.e., containing hypertrophied lenticels in pedunculate oak) was sampled after 9 days of waterlogging stress and its gene expression was investigated by RNA-seq. Genes displaying differential expression between the two species were identified with the DESeq R package and a false discovery rate of 0.001. We found that 3705 contigs were differentially regulated between the two species. Twenty-two differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The suberin biosynthesis pathway was found to be upregulated in pedunculate oak, consistent with molecular mechanisms analogous to those operating in the radial oxygen loss barrier in waterlogging-tolerant species.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""GrÃ©goire Le Provost"", ids = ""134015553""); list(name = ""Isabelle Lesur"", ids = ""5972785""); list(name = ""CÃ©line Lalanne"", ids = ""47042598""); list(name = ""Corinne Da Silva"", ids = ""133750590""); list(name = ""Karine Labadie"", ids = ""2338938""); list(name = ""Jean Marc Aury"", ids = ""41184098""); list(name = ""Jean Charles LeplÃ©"", ids = ""5080661""); list(name = ""Christophe Plomion"", ids = ""2945548"")",4f17fb85095190ecdcae1f8140c855e2b42abd36; 22ff4970ca70f22a4f76c3e32f8f9fe670c8c00a; 7d13404483a5f2976b5665aa0d8561cb99026968; f260ab2197a3c8a8893948fccc078dd51ca43ea8; 9b60e53656dbd3a3685e5d5ecfa63a23d1a11bcc; 0446adf7a4ca209c8405ba51e8c5f0d6dce59e9c; 6d3e96a39c96f68397ddc9a82f09946b62a0cf95; 9bd9b82f1db9891a9fd7648e50cd8d6ae7380e78; 1eaabb7042a2b815214313b61022cd7b3fd9b7ee,,Tree physiology,36 11,"

To address the biological effects of RF radiation, we used genome wide gene expression as the indicator. We exposed normal WI-38 human fibroblast cells to 1763 MHz mobile phone RF radiation at a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 60 W/kg with an operating cooling system for 24 h. There were no alterations in cell numbers or morphology after RF exposure. Through microarray analysis, we identified no differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the 0.05 significance level after controlling for multiple testing errors with the Benjaminiochberg false discovery rate (BH FDR) method. Meanwhile, 82 genes were differentially expressed between RF-exposed cells and controls when the significance level was set at 0.01 without correction for multiple comparisons. We found that 24 genes (0.08% of the total genes examined) were changed by more than 1.5-fold on RF exposure. However, significant enrichment of any gene set or pathway was not observed from the functional annotation analysis. From these results, we did not find any evidence that non-thermal RF radiation at a 60-W/kg SAR significantly affects cell proliferation or gene expression in WI-38 cells.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Chang-Nim Im"", ids = ""38947600""); list(name = ""Eunhye Kim"", ids = ""144778767""); list(name = ""Ae-kyung Park"", ids = ""94074566""); list(name = ""Woong-Yang Park"", ids = ""1718220"")",,18651f595a9cc6bc71aeed0a18cbc946ea38c758; bff3aa58c74eb4151413542aad60aefd9a20b9bd; 17835299959bfd6359a0a3cf3446e9f23f9d3ca5; a5f8331a7667ee579e45fff8af8e71f5d8cd9900; 17514c57af2dc6dbfa1866f8a6bdccc15b0ebfc4; 7ff38615c979a5c0dcab722ad6be1de93cc593bd; 97b505f422ffad85a8aac5de4c15e8b6a663d9c6; 39964ffe2aa657dff3b53ce96d25456b9f1d90fa; 91a0a00a0a5b8272ef677f475737b28ef5e57ae5; 7f3d5eb69891d9514f6adc7d8474af7f08430233; 775d198ce8469f1fce6b5fcdea7ed841da3a9133; dcffb3a772282772f21534479e6368be76870ffa; 7354d515883112c20eb33e4bd8b30ab0ff413f21; 334b1667cd41ca637a23c06b6a57b027b6644b97; f75d3a6c8c8074c830c8aaaf0a162ec9fb14c329; d324886bd3b1ade951d8c04a875fa0bf05fea0f2; 2e9e39d033d5b6ad791de8a7b0080de76c0e8d13; 8cb66441b88100937afb33e28d02595363184f29; 5ba1f7bffcdac9f5495ff32767549e67e63f89e7; 03c3f02ef28f31bb75245df61f545c46b1d2f83e; 2ffe2781044129867d41ab3a191efb5ab36bff84; 5a6b0734d387c1fb3f8b4e14177cda1b3af1b456; d6d8939bc9055eb05c0e5ae45c8de4bb9aa387b6,Genomics & Informatics,8,28-33
1e356c5d1c77a7a08917b962a3e4a9099ff21824,Genome-wide significant risk associations for mucinous ovarian carcinoma,"Genome-wide association studies have identified several risk associations for ovarian carcinomas but not for mucinous ovarian carcinomas (MOCs). Our analysis of 1,644 MOC cases and 21,693 controls with imputation identified 3 new risk associations: rs752590 at 2q13 (P = 3.3 Ã— 10âˆ’8), rs711830 at 2q31.1 (P = 7.5 Ã— 10âˆ’12) and rs688187 at 19q13.2 (P = 6.8 Ã— 10âˆ’13). We identified significant expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) associations for HOXD9 at 2q31.1 in ovarian (P = 4.95 Ã— 10âˆ’4, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.003) and colorectal (P = 0.01, FDR = 0.09) tumors and for PAX8 at 2q13 in colorectal tumors (P = 0.03, FDR = 0.09). Chromosome conformation capture analysis identified interactions between the HOXD9 promoter and risk-associated SNPs at 2q31.1. Overexpressing HOXD9 in MOC cells augmented the neoplastic phenotype.

060bd901bc2dc6fef89d618a0fc9222249cac226,Differentiation of clear cell and non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas by all-relevant radiomics features from multiphase CT: a VHL mutation perspective,"ObjectivesTo develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC and to investigate the possible radiogenomics link between the imaging features and a key ccRCC driver geneâ€”the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutation.MethodsIn this retrospective two-center study, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features and the other with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) features. A model combining all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex, age) was also built. The radiogenomics association between selected features and VHL mutation was investigated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients) with ROC curves analysis.ResultsThe model with eight all-relevant features from corticomedullary phase CT achieved an AUC of 0.949 and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMR features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase) with an AUC of 0.851 and an accuracy of 81.2%. Combining age and sex did not benefit the performance. Five out of eight all-relevant features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMR features were significantly associated with VHL mutation (false discovery rate-adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).ConclusionsAll-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC. Most subtype-discriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with VHL mutation, which may underlie the molecular basis of the radiomics features.Key Pointsâ€¢ All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy.â€¢ Most RCC-subtype-discriminative CT features were associated with the key RCC-driven geneâ€”the VHL gene mutation.â€¢ Radiomics model can be more accurate and interpretable when the imaging features could reflect underlying molecular basis of RCC.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhi-Cheng Li"", ids = ""49969499""); list(name = ""Guangtao Zhai"", ids = ""144826390""); list(name = ""Jinheng Zhang"", ids = ""40430862""); list(name = ""Zhongqiu Wang"", ids = ""1732231""); list(name = ""Guiqin Liu"", ids = ""47061591""); list(name = ""Guang-Yu Wu"", ids = ""144889242""); list(name = ""Dong Liang"", ids = ""145768550""); list(name = ""Hairong Zheng"", ids = ""145054415"")",53a44785bff4dd728d48ea0e84b61385da23ef61; e40330d384405da9104e6e67ff13befc125e9a56,dcd99d49af33bd14e9e0750bcf854e7b306c808a; 66afac4efee737c3aaea5ca027a67a3d6dc299c8; fada354a3332bbfa2e540a438368ecefa6e919d2; 191d0ea8f632ea1fe7464b315b478f197291d64f; 6e7cdfaae9c648bb55afeec1e4200f42289d60c5; 205d48730dcdcefbcb79d7ce83cb2f16a8842273; 92bd46b27a5c98f1c1d5c8a093e6960f6c718e44; 82f15be44f82665d9bd7c6654727e629798d0356; 1573a38fa7bb7b9b4436247ab58a63b85b5d2d70; 8ac5d66fdc1eb54dfd3d99aa68e97f0e1b1fec42; 00a42c05cfa369d8ee12165b6c97a834dd736aaa; a6133261507af708881817166842d62b67ddff36; 90bf6b37ab7305d1a0040155bbef95064edbf682; 4a7bec5222f4b3f3dc13799582fc3a89c59a5149; 50285a2c0fdb9c088274d5c0be3661615b8a19db; d41e180011fd39a1b3f0da3c0ef633ae917e7e69; 3a5225fa7d60206f444ac0c228cec2fcc4ba4317; c23d444874fa979616baa7e85e80706777a12a04; ce6ff4fbd301f11392e89beb18bc516aaca31ab9; 3c6c9861f5349deb9247e12d5c744f85e81c63cf; bab4811c77637154e1cb2061c978952bb0ee2700; 08f9dfc5401714cecd7e2d3d83aaab80abbfa0ef; 92716c2b310b2db0cd9bf93b8abd68e33628c99e; 0ad0bd1e98c5fdb69f77f902fa680678242e1ac8; a19b8d946a464b6417545734b370992dfbb95265; 2b28654d3eb518b61f0228628c789cefd00ab1e6; 5ee92a211a740c066ffb62a5d02b44115d19d40f; 0c91d5305ad34814b631d4a642bb0535a2e066ea; 86ae37eb0c2d809105471960876d9140eb8f7a50; ca9dcd958b8063fb3746ebe4a5179da1e2fe163c; 034d83319d5ed4c8fd60c48c850a75ef22f74d2e; d689889a41e02e1d33566e14d028421993aa70d5; f9b5c08711b30103ffc7ba144d4f590bbd9b065b; 397a07074735d3534a1ce379353d5891a9e95d08; 7689b53dd15702faa5d3e5faa181805e52c6fca0; 00bc2153cd21001860e43758273945110f0ae40d; b975a42a45b0b45d9eda60ebc37dea3ddf839183; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 297d0a586b3a0bf0446e7bf3732e743de7fdce42; 999256e73499cdcf8937f42fd264d30ded1b1599; ecc2ca3150dc4d4d8dceedab244114f191e05742; 5a126510245baba240b0bba7db9dc38f806020bb; 6adf2a95c649cd68b00e67ec9045f9f250d1d774; e0c706402cf6cc205a0980ee047de9fc710c6aee; eb9f7670704984198010762c04d3bdb1d6b49694; 004888621a4e4cee56b6633338a89aa036cf5ae5,European Radiology,,1-12
e44909ecb10142a415f11b776f9c8962404f4ee5,On the identification of predictive biomarkers: Detecting treatment-by-gene interaction in high-dimensional data,For personalised medicine the identification of predictive biomarkers is of great interest. These could guide the choice of therapy and could therefore optimise the benefits of patients of such treatments. The technology of gene expression microarrays allows one to scan thousands of potentially predictive biomarkers simultaneously. In clinical trials it has nowadays become common to use microarrays to collect gene expression data of the patients before treatment. The identification of predictive biomarkers can be statistically addressed by inference of gene-wise generalised linear models (GLM) including an interaction term gene expression times treatment. Inference for such GLMs is then often based on likelihood-ratio (LR) or Wald test statistics to test the influence of interaction of gene expression and treatment on the clinical treatment response. For multiple testing scenarios coming along with these gene-wise GLMs the control of the false discovery rate (FDR) would be appropriate; some false positives can be tolerated within a list of potential candidate genes which deserve further investigation. In a simulation study the utility of various FDR controlling multiple testing procedures for the identification of predictive genes is examined. Since the usual experiment on microarray data deals with small numbers of observations due to financial or probe limitations special interest lies on the behaviour of small sample sizes. Results reveal that a permutation of regressor residuals (PRR) test is superior to standard LR and Wald tests in terms of FDR control.,2012,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Wiebke Werft"", ids = ""3351373""); list(name = ""Axel Benner"", ids = ""2836909""); list(name = ""Annette Kopp-Schneider"", ids = ""1397958699"")",9cdae0567d11619811482cecfd27f4e61c974d89; 7e0d882ef405ec95962a83df2790a72839a5e81f; e5b8b7a0f0dcdbdf3c8d17d41e09e286641ec0c2; 246e13f424486ded11b87c682e22864d7a94d5e4; a8675d110368abb13a400dbfc596b7443963e016,,Comput.

In an effort to obtain deeper insight into these findings, molecular profiling of the liver and kidneys from the same animals was undertaken.ResultsTranscriptomics showed no segregation of NK603 maize and control feed groups with false discovery rates ranging from 43 to 83% at a cut-off p value of 1%. Changes in gene expression were not reflective of liver and kidney toxic effects. Metabolomics identified 692 and 673 metabolites in kidney and liver, respectively. None of the statistically significant disturbances detected (12â€“56 for different test groups) survived a false discovery rate analysis.

In an effort to identify genes that may be responsible for the initiation of OSCC lymphotropism, we examined DNA copy number gains and losses and corresponding gene expression changes from tumor cells in metastatic lymph nodes of patients with OSCC.ResultsWe performed integrative analysis of DNA copy number alterations (CNA) and corresponding mRNA expression from OSCC cells isolated from metastatic lymph nodes of 20 patients using Affymetrix 250 K Nsp I SNP and U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, respectively. Overall, genome CNA accounted for expression changes in 31% of the transcripts studied. Genome region 11q13.2-11q13.3 shows the highest correlation between DNA CNA and expression. With a false discovery rate < 1%, 530 transcripts (461 genes) demonstrated a correlation between CNA and expression. Among these, we found two subsets that were significantly associated with OSCC (n = 122) when compared to controls, and with survival (n = 27), as tested using an independent dataset with genome-wide expression profiles for 148 primary OSCC and 45 normal oral mucosa. We fit Cox models to calculate a principal component analysis-derived risk-score for these two gene sets ('122-' or '27-transcript PC'). The models combining the 122- or 27-transcript PC with stage outperformed the model using stage alone in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC = 0.82 or 0.86 vs. 0.72, with p = 0.044 or 0.011, respectively).ConclusionsGenes exhibiting CNA-correlated expression may have biological impact on carcinogenesis and cancer progression in OSCC.

9b60fbd2f0f0b9a5f7886dd96d98a7bb4ae6a83a,The association between sixteen genomeâ€wide association studiesâ€related allergic diseases loci and childhood allergic rhinitis in a Chinese Han population,"Background Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common respiratory diseases in children. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Moderateâ€toâ€severe AR decreases the quality of life and social performance in children. Objective To investigate whether polymorphisms in previously published genomeâ€wide association studies (GWAS) allergic disease loci are associated with childhood AR and the severity of AR symptoms in a Chinese Han population. Methods A caseâ€control study was conducted in 503 pediatric patients with AR and 393 control Chinese schoolâ€aged subjects. AR severity was classified as mild or moderateâ€toâ€severe according to the AR and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines. Overall, 16 tagged singleâ€nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of published GWAS associations with allergic diseases were selected. All subjects were genotyped and analyzed for the 16 selected tSNPs using the improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR) technique. Results Both rs7130588_AG and rs7927894_CT genotypes in EMSY region were associated with a significantly increased risk of AR (1.75â€fold and 1.50â€fold) compared to the AA and CC genotypes, respectively, specific to moderateâ€toâ€severe AR. The difference of rs7130588 genotypes in cases vs. controls was still statistically significant under the additive model after multiple test correction to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.818 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.240â€“2.664 (PFDR = 0.0349). The rs7130588_G allele was only associated with a high risk of moderateâ€toâ€severe AR (1.85â€fold, Page and gender_adjustment = 0.003). The rs2227284_TG genotype at the IL4 locus was significantly associated with a 0.65â€fold decreased risk of AR compared to the TT genotype. The protective effect of the rs2227284_G allele was also found in different severity of AR. Haplotype analysis showed a significantly increased AR risk associated with the haplotype Gâ€Tâ€T (rs7130588â€rs2155219â€rs7927894) and a protective effect with the haplotype Câ€Gâ€C (rs2243250â€rs2227284â€s2243290). Conclusions The loci in EMSY and IL4 can be considered as a hereditary marker for childhood AR. The rs7130588_G allele seems to predispose only to moderateâ€toâ€severe AR, though other mechanisms are also likely to be involved. HighlightsBoth rs7130588_AG and rs7927894_CT genotypes in EMSY region were associated with a significantly increased risk of allergic rhinitis (AR).The rs7130588_G allele was associated with a high risk of moderateâ€toâ€severe AR.The rs2227284_TG genotype at the IL4 locus was significantly associated with decreased risk of AR; the protective effect on the different severity of AR.A significantly positive association of one haplotype in EMSY region with AR.A protective effect with one haplotype in IL4 on AR.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Youjin Li"", ids = ""4321875""); list(name = ""Jie Chen"", ids = ""49252367""); list(name = ""Xiaoqing Rui"", ids = ""51210434""); list(name = ""Niu Li"", ids = ""2871656""); list(name = ""Fan Jiang"", ids = ""144955893""); list(name = ""Jun Miao Shen"", ids = ""143808686"")",682b33c554ddda32ac334891d0d2ddda9ff9622c,950bb724db08b009e6305157ac21b484cd2771fe; 53f61f527b4fcd4c7ecbff9aefed77f6f9a88179; 523d8aa0aae3239b82a499562c0696118edf67d3; 0b2624625be08c57db49c9d70a0299bfb7c7d7a8; 467311d5301b3a9d6c5b249293147bdb3c4add21; 8e7ae59bbfec428e57d00d9573239385d91b0412; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; 8b5346f2eeba6a385552f4a39d33999b5166e9ed; aa84317a4e29b2b943f1dd925a756a932af9c0b9; 2b76461a6af36af74f09ef5621c8194a4c5c6901; 04ca08a80bcd972baa3ef89441f3749f99e8e0b2; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 2ba15329227601eb701cffc9157f4b0d75dc7835; 839c90fe9019bb9bb9cfd952c32f9d25f185d1a9; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 90d8c5c574632dec719899cdc1f5749d0d4f2058; d8daa2f46de22a0bf06ec5174d4fdbc650d4239b; eabac1408dc7578da11880be6f3eca4801fc4ddb; 72504557d83c77c277ddcac1d2657f87d8ab4b79; 545a0f49907c0344037bf71de7efbff111003340; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; 6797515e12d049bc1ae62b6c9d7326e9fca8aa6e; 521380047946b3931e6d91b298c94a42d3597a1f; d7a568e782403ae8d01c2e83986164d150cd5849; 56b0752c4fff213d1cafecc840a6b118ed48e230; ade4da429ecafe7c8bbf8ae027addab1c292e950; f1f2981c3146fbd9300bd8fbfd0401ba65f8ce5a; 1ad252da08594b14382c3a399890d28bf0ea618e; 42d121ccca68f05c781835ab73244d016ffa1b71; 8dba60cbbc24f38897002585737fbddd3d7b992f; 579080ee4d89a84f15d9792a12982bdd03403941; 63aacc95c31d3085fed9709cc1f97dad64a178e2; 155b4fe0343ab9f69ab6a7a7554ba22c2118fdfd; eec86cfc87e84d136572a7368cfb3e05c3155cb8; ee5662c84ab73159b11d15076cdc7ee7143cdac8; ef5e1bdf3820a4b33214654c24ecdd2abdc6f8d4; 725cd02f9ab4e5e4f7db6ef0d2ff5b13819a6fc1; 8fb582a29deb4eec020f7d59a3235bfe0c9eed7e; a3b8146c7950597628689d14551e74d46cc3543d; 2d71aa1591f92791e3c78ebba17443e2ac14b4c5; 55bf8a59b7d1967ef1c5db7c90fdeb316056c76f; 60c62c3ebffd6d72048dbc8aea9ac8d514d4c433,Cytokine,111,162â€“170

EHR phenotypesâ€”structured algorithms based on clinical indicators from EHRsâ€”can aid in such identification. To develop EHR phenotypes to identify decedents with stage 4 solid-tumor cancer or stage 4â€“5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). We developed two EHR phenotypes. Each phenotype included International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. We used natural language processing (NLP) to further specify stage 4 cancer, and lab values for CKD. Decedents with cancer or CKD who had been admitted to an academic medical center in the last 6 months of life and died August 26, 2017â€“December 31, 2017. We calculated positive predictive values (PPV), false discovery rates (FDR), false negative rates (FNR), and sensitivity. Phenotypes were validated by a comparison with manual chart review. We also compared the EHR phenotype results to those admitted to the oncology and nephrology inpatient services. The EHR phenotypes identified 271 decedents with cancer, of whom 186 had stage 4 disease; of 192 decedents with CKD, 89 had stage 4â€“5 disease. The EHR phenotype for stage 4 cancer had a PPV of 68.6%, FDR of 31.4%, FNR of 0.5%, and 99.5% sensitivity. The EHR phenotype for stage 4â€“5 CKD had a PPV of 46.4%, FDR of 53.7%, FNR of 0.0%, and 100% sensitivity. EHR phenotypes efficiently identified patients who died with late-stage cancer or CKD. Future EHR phenotypes can prioritize specificity over sensitivity, and incorporate stratification of high- and low-palliative care need. EHR phenotypes are a promising method for identifying patients for research and clinical purposes, including equitable distribution of specialty palliative care.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Natalie C Ernecoff"", ids = ""83515341""); list(name = ""Kathryn L Wessell"", ids = ""15756134""); list(name = ""Laura C.

Contribution of cardiovascular disease related genetic risk factors for stroke are not clearly defined. We performed a genetic association study to assess the association of 56 previously characterized gene variants in 34 candidate genes from cardiovascular disease related biological pathways with ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage in a Chinese population.


METHODS
There were 1280 stroke patients (1101 with ischemic stroke and 179 with cerebral hemorrhage) and 1380 controls in the study. The genotypes for 56 polymorphisms of 34 candidate genes were determined by the immobilized probe approach and the associations of gene polymorphisms with ischemic stroke and cerebral hemorrhage were performed by logistic regression under an allelic model.


RESULTS
After adjusting for age, sex, BMI and hypertension status by logistic regression analysis, we found that NPPA rs5063 was significantly associated with both ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.90; P = 0.006) and cerebral hemorrhage(OR = 0.39; 95%CI, 0.19 to 0.78; P = 0.007). In addition, MTHFR rs1801133 also was associated with cerebral hemorrhage (OR = 1.48; 95%CI, 1.16 to 1.89; P = 0.001) but not with ischemic stroke (OR = 1.08; 95%CI, 0.96 to 1.22; P = 0.210). After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the association of NPPA rs5063 and MTHFR rs1801133 with cerebral hemorrhage remained significant.


CONCLUSIONS
The NPPA rs5063 is associated with reduced risk for cerebral hemorrhage and MTHFR rs1801133 is associated with increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage in a Chinese population.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wenjing Ou"", ids = ""3900179""); list(name = ""Xin Liu"", ids = ""46521964""); list(name = ""Yue Shen"", ids = ""145295898""); list(name = ""Jiana Li"", ids = ""37831474""); list(name = ""Lingbin He"", ids = ""10929700""); list(name = ""Yuan Yuan"", ids = ""144156866""); list(name = ""Xuerui Tan"", ids = ""143773641""); list(name = ""Lisheng Liu"", ids = ""38279626""); list(name = ""Jingbo Zhao"", ids = ""3033020""); list(name = ""Xingyu Wang"", ids = ""15592063"")",d997bf2e2506c55023a362a96d5e403cd1eb9fd8; 7cb31d451448463a0c81e0defad8643fb696a62c; 49a42789ae21b1ce239890f5754d6d9d288e1277; 92806133e47139a46cfecd61be622ef832f75341; 62a3a02d43fa06b6951971e5bf09de316721a6d2; 0f004d595df1a74918dbfd7f7e3d65babee8377b; ea4f0bc0a9d41d4bd7241365b5b77a1169dee7ec; a8f7be232f0480cd578577308362c46223fe8ff8; 42f8a9c0eb8021edfc1e0bfd787eb6221c021d38,9dd84305358f69ec3c5aadbd876b84c925a896f8; ffe3f40a8ee19627aa0bd9c590aaccae52034ee0; bbd01f863a4b25667c1a14337d47bda1456c4563; 629dfdaa0c639a4ba84bd9601194087c5838c70a; 830dcc196178c15763f8141ebbe6177b544bb1e8; c5c2a0bef5c257f18ee7c69d77872dc551f8ed18; 38eda93831e949086deb2ed3dd7e19ca14a3b54b; 8bf8f5a1bf5a3eacd57b9b28043adcacc6ecb691; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 67d8adb48f6179a588b825a0bd811e55bc863299; b091c830c64b9176ca08019ebcbe089cfb8809cb; 6847cdb61615ceeb8b43e58137af5ca321180454; 41543d0c8b965ff110b7fbf03b710d2dd57d3ec0; f1cf5a7d96a91670448c57ba886ad71571ec1e7c; 4ec628e58d684ef6c96aa3f46d28e1a0641aa5a0; f32b548ffdb8ceb5e45b33bed45fe8fe36c701ba; 90c76b899d330761f78b7e8630819b97527ceead; a0e0eb762baef14802197178cc4b1f9e5cea05cd; 85d23a05c12864a853d1713589c8e6047776240b; 3cc875bb6c1d5ab112ca6192697528a625f1f8e5; e805e87abee1a1f344a7e181fded4aac640009e7; 0fce6851e4cb8354c99945a86a87e0f4dd80ea5e; 81fb5e2c2709a5f76bb69366c17954011285446a; 21b44aa4e622cf3253081ffc6eee96b703ffb4c7; 8f51a9059c7867fb2024e3825993e60bdb0a4d97; 2e54728f3de12e7027faa8ce59edc3d3f010eb61; 14f68de64aadcef5f6c606707b43534ae1705ad4; 7c9d77eab31f82af777c015f6acda89eb87659eb; 13b9ab49acdd3729a3f2e87cf936a6ed0ae811f9; 2315e0dfc4d53398ae841c8f29e5e4145309867a; 0029114b3b648186958fef4081e9cbf8e6fc335b; 72871f67395e0434a1dbd1fe9e190f85a656d5d7; 1cd0c154f9b942d1a57a6d1d21cb1c9b5922d104; 6ecfeed357b10251fd2fb6461acfec9c9cf1c476; 072e9acdeabe09b501532c2789d6a75c1cf05b3f; 4ba98e75bffdf81d92e72d3ee16ff82eef0227cf; 0e768b3b93ca4de70b87474e8d8d2e95a6ecb20e; 632ecd569d363203ae6aff7d203a13f93e29567e,PLoS ONE,9,
8a2c72bcec19a456d82e15dbf1786b0ad3ee01bb,Bayesian models for pooling microarray studies with multiple sources of replications,"BackgroundBiologists often conduct multiple but different cDNA microarray studies that all target the same biological system or pathway. Within each study, replicate slides within repeated identical experiments are often produced. Pooling information across studies can help more accurately identify true target genes. Here, we introduce a method to integrate multiple independent studies efficiently.ResultsWe introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model to pool cDNA microarray data across multiple independent studies to identify highly expressed genes. Each study has multiple sources of variation, i.e. replicate slides within repeated identical experiments. Our model produces the gene-specific posterior probability of differential expression, which provides a direct method for ranking genes, and provides Bayesian estimates of false discovery rates (FDR). In simulations combining two and five independent studies, with fixed FDR levels, we observed large increases in the number of discovered genes in pooled versus individual analyses. When the number of output genes is fixed (e.g., top 100), the pooled model found appreciably more truly differentially expressed genes than the individual studies. We were also able to identify more differentially expressed genes from pooling two independent studies in Bacillus subtilis than from each individual data set. Finally, we observed that in our simulation studies our Bayesian FDR estimates tracked the true FDRs very well.ConclusionOur method provides a cohesive framework for combining multiple but not identical microarray studies with several sources of replication, with data produced from the same platform. We assume that each study contains only two conditions: an experimental and a control sample.

2d1b0e052d194f06f6f437ed4fc5de5977b261be,Association study of NOS1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of schizophrenia in Chinese Han origin,"To the editor It is known that the schizophrenia (SZ) is resulted from genetic predisposition and environment factors, and the heritability is estimated at about 80% with the evidence in family and twin studies (Cardno and Gottesman, 2000). A lot of genetic association studies about SZ with candidate genes have been performed. Recently, Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) was considered as a genetic risk factor for SZ due to the significant polymorphisms associated with SZ. Furthermore, the linkage analysis revealed that schizophrenia was significantly linked to 12q22-24 (Reif et al., 2006), on which is NOS1 gene. In this study, we investigated whether NOS1 is associated with SZ in the Chinese Han population by examining seven new SNPs between schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. A total of 2068 persons participated in this study, including 1034 unrelated Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia (625 males and 409 females, age: 45.06 Â± 12.88, onset age: 25.98 Â± 9.65) and 1034 controls (588 males and 446 females, age: 34.06 Â± 10.00). Each patient was diagnosed by two professional psychiatrists through DSM-IV criteria. Subjects in controls would be excluded if they have psychiatry disorder or drug abuse history in the first or second degree relatives. All of these participants have signed a formal informed consent. This research was supported by the Ethics Committee of the Human Genetics Center in Shanghai. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood based on phenol-chloroform method. Given to the minor allele frequency(MAF) should be more than 0.05, we selected seven SNPs in NOS1 (rs1105026, rs9658501, rs3741475, rs1047735, rs11068428, rs1123425, rs2293054). Herein, we use MassARRAYÂ® Analyzer 4 platform (Sequenom, CA, USA) to genotype all SNPs. Statistical analysis was performed on SHSsis (http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php) (Yong and Lin, 2005). For all above analyses, P values were two tailed and the significance level was set to 0.05. Then we used the R(version 3.2.2) to assess genetic models and each genetic model was adjusted by gender and province. All of the SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium except rs2293054, so it would be excluded in further analysis. Only rs1123425 had a significant association with SZ in genotype frequency (rs1123425: P=0.017). Rs9658501-rs3741475 and rs1047735-rs11068428 were revealed as two blocks with strong LD (D' > 0.9). However, there is no significant association between these two blocks and SZ. For rs1123425, logistic regression tests showed that rs1123425 can adopt codominant and recessive models after adjusted by gender and province (codominant model: P=0.0295, GA vs GG: OR=0.95, CI=0.77â€“1.18, AA vs GG: OR=1.35, CI=1.02â€“1.78; recessive model: P=0.0088, GG/GA vs AA: OR=1.39, CI=1.09â€“ 1.77). Rs1123425, which is located in the intron region of NOS1 gene, was first found to have a slight association with SZ. Levels of NOS1 protein differ in the distribution between SZ and healthy controls (AKYOL et al., 2004). So we would speculate that rs1123425 might affect the mRNA level of NOS1 and alter the amount of proteins. Although there is no further evidence to prove our result, many studies have shown that polymorphisms in NOS1 are associated with the cognitive disorder in SZ. For example, in an association study between SZ patients and healthy controls, the risk G allele of rs6490121 was revealed to have an effect on verbal IQ and working memory (Donohoe et al., 2009). There are some limitations in this study, owing to the slight significant association result, we did not give a False Discovery Rate (FDR) or Bonferroni correction. Samples need to be enlarged for better analysis. And we also need further functional studies to confirm this result. In conclusion, our result support the hypothesis that NOS1 as a candidate gene for SZ in Chinese Han population.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fei Xu"", ids = ""153215182""); list(name = ""Tao Yu"", ids = ""143797175""); list(name = ""Weibo Niu"", ids = ""38218979""); list(name = ""Zhenming Guo"", ids = ""4611272""); list(name = ""Guang He"", ids = ""97605561"")",c0d05ac95191eacb9648363409254af96ab867df; 106e06525256832ed5e1336ea783a1b655db905d,9ad1d36891102494fddcac315112fd5a7513ed90,Psychiatry Research,246,844-845

We present an approach for using transcriptomics data to focus functional studies and address redundancy. To this end, we have constructed and validated an inexpensive and publicly available rice oligonucleotide near-whole genome array, called the rice NSF45K array. We generated expression profiles for light- vs. dark-grown rice leaf tissue and validated the biological significance of the data by analyzing sources of variation and confirming expression trends with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We examined trends in the data by evaluating enrichment of gene ontology terms at multiple false discovery rate thresholds. To compare data generated with the NSF45K array with published results, we developed publicly available, web-based tools (www.ricearray.org). The Oligo and EST Anatomy Viewer enables visualization of EST-based expression profiling data for all genes on the array. The Rice Multi-platform Microarray Search Tool facilitates comparison of gene expression profiles across multiple rice microarray platforms. Finally, we incorporated gene expression and biochemical pathway data to reduce the number of candidate gene products putatively participating in the eight steps of the photorespiration pathway from 52 to 10, based on expression levels of putatively functionally redundant genes. We confirmed the efficacy of this method to cope with redundancy by correctly predicting participation in photorespiration of a gene with five paralogs. Applying these methods will accelerate rice functional genomics.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ki-Hong Jung"", ids = ""144268088""); list(name = ""Christopher Dardick"", ids = ""88110691""); list(name = ""Laura E Bartley"", ids = ""5981952""); list(name = ""Peijian Cao"", ids = ""39176365""); list(name = ""Jirapa Phetsom"", ids = ""2695542""); list(name = ""Patrick E.

All patients underwent pretreatment PET/CT scans (mean follow-up time 24â€‰Â±â€‰14Â months). Three thousand two hundred seventy-six radiomics features extracted from PET or CT components and 13 clinical parameters were used to predict progression-free survival (PFS). Univariate analysis with Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was first used to screen significant features, and redundant features with Spearmanâ€™s correlation >â€‰0.8 were further eliminated. Then, seven multivariate models involving PET features and/or CT features and/or clinical parameters (denoted as clinical, PET, CT, clinical + PET, clinical + CT, PET + CT and clinical + PET + CT) were constructed by forward stepwise multivariate Cox regression. Model performance was evaluated by concordance index (C-index).ResultsSixty patients encountered events (28 recurrences, 17 metastases, and 15 deaths). Six clinical parameters, 3 PET features, and 14 CT features in training cohort and 4 clinical parameters, 10 PET features, and 4 CT features in subset of local-regional advanced stage were significantly associated with PFS. Combining PET and/or CT features with clinical parameters showed equal or higher prognostic performance than models with PET or CT or clinical parameters alone (C-index 0.71â€“0.76 vs. 0.67â€“0.73 and 0.62â€“0.75 vs. 0.54â€“0.75 for training and validation cohorts, respectively), while the prognostic performance was significantly improved in local-regional advanced cohort (C-index 0.67â€“0.84 vs. 0.64â€“0.77, p value 0.001â€“0.059).ConclusionRadiomics features extracted from the PET and CT components of baseline PET/CT images provide complementary prognostic information and improved outcome prediction for NPC patients compared with use of clinical parameters alone.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wenbing Lv"", ids = ""3192182""); list(name = ""Qingyu Yuan"", ids = ""6810360""); list(name = ""Quanshi Wang"", ids = ""6803077""); list(name = ""Jianhua Ma"", ids = ""47792884""); list(name = ""Qianjin Feng"", ids = ""144324712""); list(name = ""Wufan Chen"", ids = ""38899257""); list(name = ""Arman Rahmim"", ids = ""2646713""); list(name = ""Lijun Lu"", ids = ""151484286"")",408dc831f10ca1ad4a413376b03894c94d90e885; 7b83c132451270570c0401f3c092931f6432eaeb; 233a06eac24b71daabf382b75153d243078f292c; 340c7165e92b6eeaa94f760797fc4bcd8bfb1c91,f1ee638784375c23b26e52fbc52ad0303bcabb4e; 9cffe59282c15e67abc8b1bf682fc8de49478dc3; 26fe99e1b53f958983c24447cd49b5abdddb8406; d3fa1786fbeb016b843153593f38f20e8a480b81; 5a2650fb98ef92471e94d818f7fabeaec1a4ebb6; 282747ccba3f53c9bd7d113b0bab076adcf40898; 4b1ae3f8bc085ba09a180325f61e0369839512aa; a6133261507af708881817166842d62b67ddff36; c4630b8880af2635a698d645f37392379fa47576; 722fc058b0316d12c7191cae0f75137a1b8ac64f; 7d83e388bf9abb3472032aaf25be65c8bb70c7b1; fcffea9b85406da79b57b49a92eb5a524d24f445; 2fe4b285777efa9b15608dcd30d2fe879f08718b; 6d29a0e5055267547c82b4ee94c7dd107dafdd94; 05272257c93086d8374dc1f4fffed23f46efa74b; 05d0ebf7bccd91599b2cfee7ee396f2b83493abf; 314486b75722cd80dc8ffc16c7b18e290535e97e; 32a27b4751a8569eb8a2644329e27315219d70e5; 0901157f41c10d05cf9740a011c9d51e438b2121; b417ab1ae2c5b203a27814d7a51dc371980d0ace; 9e7b6c52d479fb86c5daf5b988f96ebd3e0dc5b4; 123b99ff9d3f8d4f4ddd1f1e59adbaedab34645e; 4b9596fd3365886fb00f85ce2f70ae38aa3e5810; 9c190ec0a2e884117da6aa207f938715960ad3e7; d4c783b49d8030d4b22504c2e7f937fcf71eddd4; 056759ec13336142ecdd542823e1752b0448e892; 8cc63d78af55358310486d51587ad5d27cb7f4f8; fd9469ebacacc16981d95475e85e300afff9d208; dad2c13033ae3ed5606ce9a9604f841fe378019e; 8bd5d3dbab31bbd239eca9d0bc038f12dff7d786; 37ff104e270ce3e02c3b3903bbb435834cb975f2; 317b484c3b0b87f637f36c17addf562a5601f9c8; 67fd37a4ba58b472e1ec127565b89c9b30c3a1b1; 1cacf3b37b71fddd4cbed4338a05aa670d1062ce; 0b0400bd1c2b9ba65080534f09d34949a6cf6f14; 7595f99809b74b72161dde194d62d938f2f5a1e5; 6800e798fecc10bdd895560562f0b29c47241920; 7a14dc59fa0a3cdc0402915cadda1cd86d46c95a; 4210780b3d057f00d424e1399369a56a0532332e; dec23c312fa7f680407a910bc559066ae13fa5b9; 858cb8deef2cf8ad0bdeeeed4cd28bb92fde5c6c; f73968a0b00ee0e318f61595299b335c94c1753c; 233a06eac24b71daabf382b75153d243078f292c; 1d72f25545d93332b7e2f5d7211655e63d864796; cbecae30f8fce63cb11aa25267be76c347453719; abdb4d9bc982a14201aa084bf5b1d3d44f3cde9c; c7e397ad68495664eb64077b51189e7cf3fc75f0; 86cfd886226b5853c31a2b36f7e556cd27346402; 604ec6924397f793c3286f4e7e2b4ba17a27ee24; 2ed506ba387156abc732f20aedbfcc003b1ddcf9; 25cb862e40fe53ecee040b6d559fad66c1bd698b; b7abaa9d5842f49ae66f6a5043e8b032b527e98b; 73bf17ad3eb1a0fe2254d09ca72a6304c88fa8aa; 2250987c4512b68a766da8accaf19a2f96789dc9; 1634c3159c2504ded68c22aba74178d4474a51fc; dd0961c457b255ae6cc677fac9709ad5b6e39f11; 721a9d105fa18bb6a607c8ad0ee92f73dd24c3b5; f547cab003f79a84bd81a6de628da30afe797d39; 116f6b5bd8733ebcd1b9555762247264421400ba; 48b6bec14bd74a7edc3dfd5f6a824165c44b64be; bbbfe4a9073cae16e90641f052b43de504aa97e6; 1ee74722e719e5bb00bf00436548497325046064,Molecular Imaging and Biology,,1-11
57231c03953edb95b74b7d4fe0fce554017d453a,Abstract A78: Common single nucleotide polymorphisms in immunoregulatory genes and multiple myeloma risk among women in Connecticut,"A78 Background Increased risk of multiple myeloma has been observed among those who have a family history, suggesting a genetic component in multiple myeloma development. Also, a number of studies have shown that changes in immuoregulatory role of T cells may contribute to the development of multiple myeloma. Objective In light of the relationship between immune system dysregulation and multiple myeloma risk, we investigated whether genetic variation in 153 immune function genes are associated with multiple myeloma susceptibility in a population-based case-control study conducted among White Connecticut women. Methods Tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; N=876) were selected using a pairwise linkage-disequilibrium based algorithm. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SNP genotypes were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Tests of association for gene regions were conducted using the minP test. We applied the false discovery rate (FDR) method to the minP test results as a means of controlling for multiple comparisons. Haplotype analyses among subjects were performed using the haplo.stat statistical package in the R program. Haplotype frequencies were estimated from genotype data using the expectation-maximization algorithm while at the same time excluding those with frequencies less than 1%, and were evaluated by the global score test. Results Six out of 75 gene regions were significantly ( P PTMS - LAG3 - CD4-GPR162-LEPREL gene region remained noteworthy after adjustment for multiple tests using the FDR method (min P =0.0018; noteworthy at a level of FDR control of 0.14). In this region, a total of six SNPs in two genes ( CD4 and LAG3 ) were significantly associated with risk ( P trend AG/GG =2.53, 95% CI=1.59-4.02; P trend =0.0001). Haplotype analyses also supported an association with rs11064392. Conclusion Our findings suggest that genetic variation in CD4 may influence susceptibility to multiple myeloma.

cbba8cc835e3f4c74aee803da7f8e04c6152e704,Characterization of the colostrum and transition milk proteomes from primiparous and multiparous Holstein dairy cows.,"Colostrum plays a vital role in the nutrition, development, and immunity of a newborn calf. This study aimed to characterize the protein profile of colostrum and to identify changes in the colostrum proteome across parity during the transition to mature milk. Colostrum and transition milk samples were collected at milkings 1, 2, 4, and 14 after calving from multiparous (n = 10) and primiparous cows (n = 10). Samples were skimmed, fractionated, and enriched before analysis for low-abundance proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). Changes in protein abundances were analyzed using PROC MIXED in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with determination of the adaptive false discovery rate adjustment using a MULTTEST procedure to identify effects of parity (P), milking number (MN), and their interaction (MNÃ—P). We identified 86 proteins through LC-MS/MS, including 3 low-abundance proteins that were affected by P, 78 that were affected by MN, and 36 affected by MNÃ—P. Prominent ontological groupings of proteins affected by MN included defense or immunity proteins, such as immunoglobulins. Proteins involved in the plasminogen activating cascade and more broadly, blood coagulation, were affected by MNÃ—P. The results of this study add to increasing knowledge of the colostrum and transition milk proteomes, and this is the first study to find evidence of different abundances of these proteins when examined across P, MN, and MNÃ—P. These findings aid in the identification of potential milk protein biomarkers for mammary health during the early postpartum period.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark James Fahey"", ids = ""144610458""); list(name = ""Amariah Joanne Fischer"", ids = ""145005666""); list(name = ""Michael A Steele"", ids = ""40323214""); list(name = ""Sabrina L.

627f37c090f3bbf11b07868c68403b9f85303bb7,A comparison of gray matter density in restless legs syndrome patients and matched controls using voxel-based morphometry.,"BACKGROUND
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. Four studies have examined structural differences between the brains of RLS patients and healthy controls, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). All 4 studies have provided different results.


METHODS
Optimized VBM was used to search for structural differences in gray matter density. Sixteen RLS patients naÃ¯ve to dopaminergic drugs and 16 age- and sex-matched controls received structural T1-weighted MR scans. Structural data were analyzed using FSL-VBM.


RESULTS
No difference in gray matter density was detected between the two groups (voxel-wise significance: no significant voxels at P= .89 (whole brain Family Wise Error (FWE) corrected); no significant voxels at P < .05 (whole brain False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected; smallest achievable FDR threshold .99).


CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION
The present study did not replicate (confirm) previous findings of structural brain changes in RLS, but instead supported the findings of a recent study showing a lack of gray matter alteration in an elderly RLS population. More specifically, the results do not support neuronal loss as an underlying disease mechanism in RLS. Potential limitations in the application of VBM are also discussed.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert A.

f55785c7171c8c9f38685bb03d8abe3734116ded,"Identification of Genetic Loci Shared Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Intelligence, and Educational Attainment","BACKGROUND
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is consistently associated with lower levels of educational attainment. A recent large genome-wide association study identified common gene variants associated with ADHD, but most of the genetic architecture remains unknown.


METHODS
We analyzed independent genome-wide association study summary statistics for ADHD (19,099 cases and 34,194 controls), educational attainment (NÂ = 842,499), and general intelligence (NÂ = 269,867) using a conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate (FDR) statistical framework that increases power of discovery by conditioning the FDR on overlapping associations. The genetic variants identified were characterized in terms of function, expression, and biological processes.


RESULTS
We identified 58 linkage disequilibrium-independent ADHD-associated loci (conditional FDR < 0.01), of which 30 were shared between ADHD and educational attainment or general intelligence (conjunctional FDR < 0.01) and 46 were novel risk loci for ADHD.


CONCLUSIONS
These results expand on previous genetic and epidemiological studies and support the hypothesis of a shared genetic basis between these phenotypes. Although the clinical utility of the identified loci remains to be determined, they can be used as resources to guide future studies aiming to disentangle the complex etiologies of ADHD, educational attainment, and general intelligence.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kevin S.

46fba879fee3c308f83e4d5148d88f9b887d8760,Did the genomic data flood overrun the statistical levee ? Statistical approaches to analyse genomic data ( without drowning ),"Some practical aspects in design and analysis of biomarker studies Stephan Lehr Baxter Innovations GmbH, Vienna, Austria The aim of this presentation is to set the scene for the workshop from a practical perspective. In particular, some definitions and guidelines will be sketched, possible pitfalls in the development of a prediction rule based on highdimensional data will be demonstrated and clinical trial designs for predictive biomarker validation will be discussed. Test statistics for two-group comparisons of zero-inflated intensity values Andreas Gleiss, Mohammed Dakna , Harald Mischak and Georg Heinze 1 Section for Clinical Biometrics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University Vienna, Austria 2 Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany Many experiments conducted in molecular biology compare intensity values obtained by micro-RNA transcriptomics, proteomics or metabolomics ('Omics') procedures between two groups of independent biological samples differing in an experimental condition or in the health status of the subjects. A special characteristic of such data is the frequent occurrence of zero intensity values caused by compounds (e.g., micro RNAs, peptides or metabolites) that cannot be detected in some samples. Zero intensities can arise either by true absence of a compound or by a signal that is below a technical limit of detection. In the literature the distribution of observed signals is viewed either as a mixture of a binomial distribution (absence or presence of a detectable signal) and a continuous distribution (intensity if signal is present) or as a left-censored continuous distribution. While so-called two-part tests compare mixture distributions between groups, one-part tests treat the zero-inflated distributions as left-censored. We propose to employ a Left-Inflated Mixture model to combine these two approaches. We perform a comparative simulation study using the setting of a typical omics experiment with the aim to test differential expression in several hundreds of compounds simultaneously. Both types of distributional assumptions as well as combinations of both are considered when comparing power and effect estimation across the various methods considered. We discuss issues of application using an example from proteomics. We conclude that the considered tests generally show their strengths in scenarios satisfying their respective distributional assumptions. If it is a priori unclear which distributional assumptions best fit the data at hand then a two-part Wilcoxon test can be recommended. Assuming a log-normal distribution the Left-Inflated Mixture model provides direct estimates for the proportions of the two considered types of zero intensities. Stopping rules for sequential trials in high-dimensional data Sonja Zehetmayer Section for Medical Statistics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University Vienna, Austria Sequential trials have been proposed that allow for an early stopping of the trial in studies involving large scale hypothesis testing as in microarray experiments. To control the False Discovery Rate, multiplicity adjustment is required only for the number of hypotheses but not for the number of interim looks (under suitable assumptions asymptotically for an increasing number of hypotheses). In this talk we introduce novel stopping rules that stop a trial early if a certain success criterion is fulfilled based on the proportion of rejected hypotheses. Next Generation Sequencing Data Analysis: From ChIP-Seq read islands to epigenomics information Markus Jaritz Research Intitute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Campus Vienna Biocenter Within the Epigenomics Gen-Au project, several hundred samples have been sequenced using ChIP-Seq technology since 2008. Despite powerful open source tools, many scripts, workflows and analysis strategies had to be developed. We present an overview of our analysis pipeline, addressing issues such as sequencing quality measurements, sample similarity, peak calling, peak overlaps and motif finding. The Relevance of Next Generation Sequencing for Personalized Medicine Christoph Bock CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria Max Planck Institute for Informatics, SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany In my presentation, I will summarize the role of next generation sequencing for personalized medicine and highlight the relevance of bioinformatic and biostatistical methods for interpreting the vast amount of genome, epigenome and transcriptome data that are being generated at CeMM and at many genomics institutes worldwide. The talk will also discuss our ongoing work with the European BLUEPRINT project consortium (http://blueprint-epigenome.eu/) aimed at establishing comprehensive epigenome maps of hematopoietic cell types and various types of leukemia cells. I will conclude by outlining an integrated computational/experimental approach toward rational design of epigenetic combination therapies (Bock and Lengauer 2012 Nature Reviews Cancer), which we pursue in collaboration between the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine and the Medical University of Vienna.

Class-imbalanced class prediction for high-dimensional data Lara Lusa and Rok Blagus Institute for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine , University of Ljubljana, Slovenia The goal of class prediction studies is to develop rules to accurately predict the class membership of new samples. The rules are derived using the values of the variables available for each subject: the main characteristic of highdimensional data is that the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples. Frequently the classifiers are developed using class-imbalanced data, i.e., data sets where the number of samples in each class is not equal. Standard classification methods used on class-imbalanced data often produce classifiers that do not accurately predict the minority class; the prediction is biased towards the majority class. High-dimensionality poses additional challenges when dealing with class-imbalanced prediction. We show how class-imbalance impacts six types of classifiers, using simulated data and a publicly available data set from a breast cancer geneexpression microarray study. We also investigate the effectiveness of some strategies that are available to overcome the effect of class imbalance. We devote special attention to SMOTE, a popular oversampling technique and to boosting methods. Gene selection in microarray survival studies under non-proportional hazards Daniela Dunkler and Georg Heinze Section for Clinical Biometrics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University Vienna, Austria Many studies aim at finding, among a huge number of candidate genes, those which are possibly linked to survival. With non-proportional hazards Cox regression (CR) could lead to underor overestimation of effects. Given the large number of genes it is not feasible to determine the functional form of the time dependency for each gene. Moreover, researchers are often interested in a risk score, which could be used to identify high and low risk groups at the start of follow-up. Such a score should be interpretable irrespective of time-dependent effects. We consider the odds of concordance, which are defined by OC=c/(1-c) where c is the concordance probability P(T1<T0), the probability that a person randomly selected from group G1 dies earlier than a person randomly selected from G0. Since gene expressions are not binary, we generalize OC to continuous data. Under proportional hazards, OC is estimated by the CR hazard ratio. Under non-proportional hazards OC can be obtained from weighted Cox regression (WCR) or a novel method based on conditional logistic regression, called concordance regression (CCR). The latter has the additional advantage that it has an attractive nonparametric analogue. We demonstrate properties and aspects of application of these novel methods in the analysis of real and simulated studies. We also briefly discuss the possibility of their application in the context of regularized regression models with a high-dimensional predictor space. Concluding, OC and c are concise single numbers useful for clear decisions at time zero. They can be utilized to select genes irrespective of proportional hazards and are obtained by WCR or CCR. WCR and CCR are available as R packages coxphw and concreg, respectiveley, on CRAN. Regularized regression for omics data: Why one size doesnâ€™t fit all, but you nevertheless should try Harald Binder Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany Modern â€œomicsâ€ techniques for molecular measurement, such as SNP microarrays or RNA-Seq, promise improved prognosis for patients or even personalized medicine. For statisticians this means the challenge of linking highdimensional covariate vectors to clinical endpoints, such as survival, for identifying important molecular entities. While univariate techniques are popular for controlling false discovery rates, they do not directly provide risk prediction models. Regularized regression techniques, such as the lasso or componentwise boosting, allow to fit regression models with high-dimensional covariate vectors, providing automatic selection of a small number of potentially important molecular entities, e.g. SNP or gene signatures. Unfortunately, application to different types of molecular platforms is not straightforward. Potential pitfalls will exemplarily be illustrated for componentwise boosting in applications to SNP data and to RNA-Seq data.

Genome-scale loss-of-function screens can assay fitness defects induced by partial gene knockdown, using RNA interference, or complete gene knockout, using new CRISPR techniques. These screens can reveal the basic blueprint required for cellular proliferation. Moreover, comparing healthy to cancerous tissue can uncover genes that are essential only in the tumor; these genes are targets for the development of specific anticancer therapies. Unfortunately, progress in this field has been hampered by offtarget effects of perturbation reagents and poorly quantified error rates in large-scale screens. To improve the quality of information derived from these screens, and to provide a framework for understanding the capabilities and limitations of CRISPR technology, we derive gold-standard reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, and provide a Bayesian classifier of gene essentiality that outperforms current methods on both RNAi and CRISPR screens. Our results indicate that CRISPR technology is more sensitive than RNAi, and that both techniques have nontrivial false discovery rates that can be mitigated by rigorous analytical methods.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Traver Hart"", ids = ""47777695""); list(name = ""Kevin R.

b64b7905eddf3640f68f312ad208770345524437,Transcriptional profiling during foetal skeletal muscle development of Piau and Yorkshire-Landrace cross-bred pigs.,"Skeletal muscle development is a complex process involving the coordinated expression of thousands of genes. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of pigs at 40 and 70â€ƒdays (d) of gestation (developmental stages encompassing primary and secondary fibre formation) in Yorkshire-Landrace (YL) cross-bred pigs and Piau pigs (a naturalized Brazilian breed), which are two breed types that differ in muscularity. Foetuses were obtained from gilts at each gestational age (nâ€ƒ=â€ƒ3 YL; nâ€ƒ=â€ƒ4 Piau), and transcriptional profiling was performed using the Pigoligoarray microarray containing 20â€ƒ400 oligonucleotides. A total of 486 oligonucleotides were differentially expressed (fold change (FC)â€ƒâ‰¥â€ƒ1.5; false discovery rate (FDR)â€ƒâ‰¤â€ƒ0.05) between 40 and 70â€ƒd gestation in either YL or Piau pigs, and a total of 1300 oligonucleotides were differentially expressed (FCâ€ƒâ‰¥â€ƒ1.5; FDRâ€ƒâ‰¤â€ƒ0.05) between YL and Piau pigs at either age. Gene ontology annotation and pathway analyses determined functional classifications for differentially expressed genes and revealed breed type-specific developmental expression patterns. Thirteen genes were selected for confirmation by qRT-PCR analyses, and expression patterns for most of these genes were confirmed, providing further insight into the roles of these genes in pig muscle development. This study revealed both developmental and breed type-specific patterns of gene expression in foetal pig skeletal muscle, including genes not previously associated with myogenesis. This information will contribute to future pig genetic improvement efforts.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Bruna Pena Sollero"", ids = ""14051646""); list(name = ""S. E. F.

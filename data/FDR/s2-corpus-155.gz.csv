09412ac60235eccc4eb77f92bd202ada41f8d13f,Industrial process operating optimality assessment based on Gaussian mixture model,"As a new research issue, the operating optimality assessment for industrial processes has received growing interests in recent years. In this study, a novel online operating optimality assessment method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is proposed for industrial processes. The offline training data can be automatically divided into several data sets by the proposed performance grade division method, and it lays the foundation for establishing the assessment models. Then the assessment models are developed not only for each stable performance grade but also for the performance grade conversions for the first time, which provides important guidelines for online assessment. In online assessment, the multiple hypotheses testing technology is used to ensure the reliability of the assessment results through controlling the false discovery rate. The validity and superiority of the proposed operating optimality assessment strategy are then validated through case study on gold hydrometallurgical process.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yan Liu"", ids = ""46399890""); list(name = ""Fuli Wang"", ids = ""22136688""); list(name = ""Yuqing Chang"", ids = ""2620462"")",,fdbb5c96c8f797f850d02b2faf035e9fc4f5925a; 1cedd4238c40cce5cb812fec443981dc5b772d9f; 77e228cd3525027e76e8f36cbec2efa45baf8b53; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bdc97b3ac9b3afed9b30182e6c1f7f67082b173f; 0759ae4036e01c4eeff2d8ee8929d5fb77828865; 0c93f0cfb96fe67b9c5254bbbf6e32a72a3db42d; 1c6b85a4c60c05bf46bae177d1fc8ae32ed92528; a67d2d9a318736560977a374c9a23d4dcf395f2b,2017 29th Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC),,713-718
6cc4f88f2c284567b0b7891cad8a8a66a31ff380,A Neural Signature of Parkinsonism in Patients With Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: A Multimodal MRI Study Using Parallel ICA.,"Motor abnormalities in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have increasingly attracted scientific interest in the past years. However, the neural mechanisms underlying parkinsonism in SSD are unclear. The present multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study examined SSD patients with and without parkinsonism, as defined by a Simpson and Angus Scale (SAS) total score of â‰¥4 (SAS group, n = 22) or <4 (non-SAS group, n = 22). Parallel independent component analysis (p-ICA) was used to examine the covarying components among gray matter volume maps computed from structural MRI (sMRI) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) maps computed from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) patient data. We found a significant correlation (P = .020, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected) between an sMRI component and an rs-fMRI component, which also significantly differed between the SAS and non-SAS group (P = .042, z = -2.04). The rs-fMRI component comprised the cortical sensorimotor network, and the sMRI component included predominantly a frontothalamic/cerebellar network. Across the patient sample, correlations adjusted for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores showed a significant relationship between tremor score and loadings of the cortical sensorimotor network, as well as between glabella-salivation score, frontothalamic/cerebellar and cortical sensorimotor network loadings. These data provide novel insights into neural mechanisms of parkinsonism in SSD. Aberrant bottom-up modulation of cortical motor regions may account for these specific motor symptoms, at least in patients with SSD.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Christian Wolf"", ids = ""38226745""); list(name = ""Mahmoud Rashidi"", ids = ""47898546""); list(name = ""Stefan Fritze"", ids = ""14780688""); list(name = ""Katharina M Kubera"", ids = ""4790839""); list(name = ""Georg Northoff"", ids = ""144296357""); list(name = ""Fabio Sambataro"", ids = ""145624462""); list(name = ""Vince D.

95529fd4ca45c69c7ac57af7c062fd56bd534ef3,Altered brain diffusion tensor imaging indices in adolescents with the Fontan palliation,"PurposeSingle ventricle heart disease (SVHD) patients show injury in brain sites that regulate autonomic, mood, and cognitive functions. However, the nature (acute or chronic changes) and extent of brain injury in SVHD are unclear. Our aim was to examine regional brain tissue damage in SVHD over controls using DTI-based mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) procedures.MethodsWe collected two DTI series (3.0-T MRI), mood and cognitive data, from 27 SVHD and 35 control adolescents. Whole-brain MD, AD, RD, and FA maps were calculated from each series, realigned and averaged, normalized to a common space, smoothed, and compared between groups using ANCOVA (covariates, age and sex; false discovery rate, pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Region-of-interest analyses were performed to calculate MD, AD, RD, and FA values for magnitude assessment between groups.ResultsSVHD patients showed impaired mood and cognitive functions over healthy adolescents. Multiple brain sites in SVHD showed increased MD values, including the insula, caudate, cingulate, hypothalamus, thalamus, medial prefrontal and frontal cortices, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, precentral gyrus, amygdala, cerebellum, corpus callosum, basal forebrain, mammillary bodies, internal capsule, midbrain, fornix, and occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices, indicating chronic tissue changes. Similar areas showed either increased AD or RD values, with RD changes more enhanced over AD in SVHD compared to controls. Few brain regions emerged with increased or decreased FA values in SVHD patients over controls.ConclusionSVHD adolescents, more than a decade from their last surgical procedure, show widespread brain abnormalities in autonomic, mood, and cognitive regulatory areas. These findings indicate that brain injury is in a chronic stage in SVHD with predominantly myelin changes that may result from previous hypoxia/ischemia- or developmental-induced processes.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sadhana Singh"", ids = ""48039596""); list(name = ""Bhaswati Roy"", ids = ""39457288""); list(name = ""Nancy A.

3fb2b9e5be04098aef5715a49565d594ae072b8f,"Asthma and bronchodilator responsiveness are associated with polymorphic markers of ARG1, CRHR2 and chromosome 17q21.","OBJECTIVE
Asthma is caused by complex interactions between multiple genes. Î²2-Agonist is the standard rescue treatment to relieve asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction. A genetic study for spirometric parameters helps to predict the responses to this antiasthma treatment. This study investigated the relationship between asthma and bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) and eight asthma genes.


METHODS
Fifteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes were genotyped in 345 Chinese asthmatics and 464 controls. Gene-gene interactions were analysed by generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR).


RESULTS
The diagnosis of asthma was associated with rs7216389 in ORMDL3 [odds ratio (OR) 0.74 and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.56-0.99] and rs3756780 in ARG1 (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.89) and BDR with rs2749935 in ARG1. However, none of these associations remained significant at 5% when adjusted for multiple testing by the Bonferroni correction or a false discovery rate. GMDR analyses revealed that rs7216389 in ORMDL3 and rs3756780 in ARG1 might interact for a risk of asthma. Individuals with high-risk genotypes had OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.24-2.23) for asthma when compared with those with low-risk genotypes. GMDR suggested a two-locus model with rs2749935 in ARG1 and rs2190242 in CRHR2 to be associated with BDR. Specifically, reversibility of forced expiratory volume in 1 s was higher in high-risk than that in low-risk patients [mean (95% CI): 10.7 (8.6-12.9) vs. 6.8 (5.9-7.6)%]; with the latter group showing higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s reversibility compared with high-risk controls [2.8 (1.4-4.3)%].


CONCLUSION
ARG1 and ORMDL3 may interact to determine the risk of asthma and ARG1 and CRHR2 to alter BDR in asthmatics. Nonetheless, this study is only hypothesis-generating as none of the single marker comparisons is significant when adjusted for multiple testing. These findings need to be confirmed in independent populations.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hing Yee Sy"", ids = ""37626405""); list(name = ""Fanny W.S.

aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474,False Discovery Rates: A New Deal,"We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating False Discovery Rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This â€œunimodal assumptionâ€ (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation â€“ estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem â€“ and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we introduce the term â€œlocal false sign rateâ€ to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable, and can be more robustly estimated.

Quantitative proteomics is evolving to become an indispensable tool in the era of precision medicine. Using an unbiased lipoproteomic discovery workflow we sought to investigate the lipoproteomic differences between stable CAD patients and controls subjects and to reveal novel pathways/mechanisms that underpin this common disease. Methods Male patients with stable CAD (n = 49, mean Â± SD; age 64 yrs Â± 8.69) and without CAD (n = 17; mean age 74 yrs Â± 6.21) were recruited into this single centre prospective cohort study. Plasma was co-incubated with a lipophilic affinity resin. Isolated lipoproteins were reduced, alkylated, digested and analysed using label-free high definition ion mobility enabled mass spectrometry. Raw data was analysed using Progenesis QI software with a stringent false discovery rate of 1%. Results 202 proteins showed significant differential expression between the CAD patients and the control subjects (P Conclusion Patients with CAD have a distinct pathognomonic lipoproteomic cargo.

66ef8e2cc753cb6da5f9d3af1e52d20578014ad7,In-Search Selection of Monoisotopic Peaks Improves the Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides,"Cross-linking/mass spectrometry (CLMS) has gone through a maturation process similar to standard proteomics by adapting key methods such as false discovery rate control and quantification. However, methods for preprocessing mass spectrometric data of cross-linked peptides are currently underexplored. Preprocessing only requires computational efforts and can significantly improve data quality and search engine results. Our analysis shows that monoisotopic peak selection is a major weakness of current data handling approaches. High precursor masses paired with low intensities, typical of cross-linked peptides, are the main causes of the frequent misassignment of their monoisotopic peaks. We address this by â€˜in-search selection of the monoisotopic peakâ€™ in Xi (Xi-MPS). We compare and evaluate the performance of MaxQuant-Xi, OpenMS-Xi and Xi-MPS on three publicly available datasets. Xi-MPS always delivered the highest number of identifications with âˆ¼2 to 4-fold increase of PSMs without compromising identification accuracy as determined by FDR estimation and comparison to crystallographic models.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Swantje Lenz"", ids = ""81629870""); list(name = ""Sven H.

8beda72eae87b65311cd1334e6cd4333f3a5f78c,Multiple Comparisons in Microarray Data Analysis,"Multiplicity is a challenging statistical issue in drug discovery, and a particular example is microarray study. The traditional approach of controlling of the family-wise error rate (FWER) is conservative when the number of tests is large. A more appropriate approach is to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Since the development of the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) FDR procedure in 1995, many modifications have been proposed aimed at relaxing the requirement for independent test statistics or improving the power of the BH FDR procedure. Comparisons of these procedures in the current literature are not comprehensive and the conclusions on performances are inconsistent. The objectives of this article are three-fold: (a) to perform a more comprehensive comparison of extant multiple testing procedures using two real microarray datasets and various simulated data sets; (b) to explore potential reasons for the inconsistencies in published simulation results; and (c) to identify suitable FDR procedures under...",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Donghui Zhang"", ids = ""49357183""); list(name = ""Li Liu"", ids = ""102363555"")",,,Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research,2,368-382
598300d71eb7b33f2c2903ff5c85da27d0beeba2,A novel feature selection for RNA-seq analysis,"RNA-seq data are challenging existing omics data analytics for its volume and complexity. Although quite a few computational models were proposed from different standing points to conduct differential expression (D.E.) analysis, almost all these methods do not provide a rigorous feature selection for high-dimensional RNA-seq count data. Instead, most or even all genes are invited into differential calls no matter they have real contributions to data variations or not. Thus, it would inevitably affect the robustness of D.E. analysis and lead to the increase of false positive ratios. In this study, we presented a novel feature selection method: nonnegative singular value approximation (NSVA) to enhance RNA-seq differential expression analysis by taking advantage of RNA-seq count data's non-negativity. As a variance-based feature selection method, it selects genes according to its contribution to the first singular value direction of input data in a data-driven approach. It demonstrates robustness to depth bias and gene length bias in feature selection in comparison with its five peer methods. Combining with state-of-the-art RNA-seq differential expression analysis, it contributes to enhancing differential expression analysis by lowering false discovery rates caused by the biases. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection by proposing a data-driven differential expression analysis: NSVA-seq, besides conducting network marker discovery.",2017,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Henry Han"", ids = ""143905093"")",19e84a2e3dfde3c7aba19d6b1f410fb69fba8921; 0813a16dad34354bbb3985e22f46c32a18c8e165,,Computational biology and chemistry,71,"

6c704d32435f42cdc6c159ac7b0b098fb51481de,Heritability and Tissue Specificity of Expression Quantitative Trait Loci,"Variation in gene expression is heritable and has been mapped to the genome in humans and model organisms as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We applied integrated genome-wide expression profiling and linkage analysis to the regulation of gene expression in fat, kidney, adrenal, and heart tissues using the BXH/HXB panel of rat recombinant inbred strains. Here, we report the influence of heritability and allelic effect of the quantitative trait locus on detection of cis- and trans-acting eQTLs and discuss how these factors operate in a tissue-specific context. We identified several hundred major eQTLs in each tissue and found that cis-acting eQTLs are highly heritable and easier to detect than trans-eQTLs. The proportion of heritable expression traits was similar in all tissues; however, heritability alone was not a reliable predictor of whether an eQTL will be detected. We empirically show how the use of heritability as a filter reduces the ability to discover trans-eQTLs, particularly for eQTLs with small effects. Only 3% of cis- and trans-eQTLs exhibited large allelic effects, explaining more than 40% of the phenotypic variance, suggestive of a highly polygenic control of gene expression. Power calculations indicated that, across tissues, minor differences in genetic effects are expected to have a significant impact on detection of trans-eQTLs. Trans-eQTLs generally show smaller effects than cis-eQTLs and have a higher false discovery rate, particularly in more heterogeneous tissues, suggesting that small biological variability, likely relating to tissue composition, may influence detection of trans-eQTLs in this system. We delineate the effects of genetic architecture on variation in gene expression and show the sensitivity of this experimental design to tissue sampling variability in large-scale eQTL studies.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Enrico G Petretto"", ids = ""3021231""); list(name = ""Jonathan Mangion"", ids = ""47057134""); list(name = ""Nicholas J.

e4a3b73517442b724c95baac9792b023edf046bc,Plasma metabolites associated with colorectal cancer: A discoveryâ€replication strategy,"Colorectal cancer is known to arise from multiple tumorigenic pathways; however, the underlying mechanisms remain not completely understood. Metabolomics is becoming an increasingly popular tool in assessing biological processes. Previous metabolomics research focusing on colorectal cancer is limited by sample size and did not replicate findings in independent study populations to verify robustness of reported findings. Here, we performed a ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) screening on EDTA plasma from 268 colorectal cancer patients and 353 controls using independent discovery and replication sets from two European cohorts (ColoCare Study: nâ€‰=â€‰180 patients/nâ€‰=â€‰153 controls; the Colorectal Cancer Study of Austria (CORSA) nâ€‰=â€‰88 patients/nâ€‰=â€‰200 controls), aiming to identify circulating plasma metabolites associated with colorectal cancer and to improve knowledge regarding colorectal cancer etiology. Multiple logistic regression models were used to test the association between disease state and metabolic features. Statistically significant associated features in the discovery set were taken forward and tested in the replication set to assure robustness of our findings. All models were adjusted for sex, age, BMI and smoking status and corrected for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate.

In this paper, we propose a framework for modeling effect sizes of whole-brain voxels. Specifically, we assume a semi-parametric hierarchical mixture model to flexibly estimate the underlying effect size distribution for the whole-brain voxels and a hidden Markov random field model to incorporate the spatial dependency among contiguous voxels. We then derive a multiple testing procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and a procedure for effect size estimation, for both individual voxels and prespecified regions that have structural or functional features. The proposed method for the estimation of effect sizes reduces the selection bias caused by selecting voxels or regions with the greatest observed effect sizes, possibly due to random errors.

6a9286a54caab4637196559f026b083ebf476b18,Development of expression-based biomarkers of Dasatinib response in hematologic malignancies,"Numerous collections of cancer cell lines provide opportunities to characterize genetic signatures that distinguish response and resistance to a variety of drugs. The NCI-60, Cancer Cell Line Encylopedia (CCLE), and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) provide a wealth of information that includes genomic sequences, mutational status, gene expression, as well as response to panels of drugs used in cancer therapies. This offers a unique opportunity to apply approaches that may provide genetic profiles that define response and resistance, with the potential to apply these as predictors in clinical decisions. The GDSC is a collection of 1047 cell lines from diverse tumor types that have been tested with 265 drugs. The data collection includes DNA sequence, mutation status, and gene expression data that we have used to develop a pipeline of computational approaches that predict response and resistance. Drug response is determined by a 9 step twofold serial dilution of drug concentration and measuring cell viability. From these, two quantitative values are provided: the drug concentration required to reduce viability by 50% (IC50) and the area under the dose-response survival curve (AUSC). Gene expression data is available from the Affymetrix U219 gene array platform. Because expression patterns may vary widely simply based on tissue specificity, we chose to limit our initial analysis to B-cell malignancies, represented by 71 cell lines derived from leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas. Our approach comprises a series of steps in which we classify response and resistance, develop a differential classification profile of gene expression patterns, identify features by pathway analysis, and validate on cell lines and reported clinical outcomes. We demonstrate this approach to stratify and predict response to the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib. Dasatinib is a multi-target kinase inhibitor that has affinity for about 50 kinases and is most widely used to manage chronic myelogenous leukemia . For this report, we develop an approach that identifies a five gene signature distinguishing dasatinib response and resistance. We arranged the 71 B-cell lines by response, using both Area Under the Survival Curve (AUSC) and IC50. The distribution of response favored non-response, with only 14 lines showing a strong response to low doses, and 11 lines showing essentially no response. Specifically, we classified Responders as lines that show an AUSC< 0.75, and an IC50 value less than the maximum drug concentration divided by 4 and Non-Responders were defined as having an AUSC> 0.98 and an IC50 greater than maximum dose tested. This resulted in the 14 strong Responder lines vs. 11 highly resistant (Non-Responder) lines, representing the extreme ends of response and resistance. Our rationale was that underlying this wide separation of response may be a common expression signature or pathway(s) that can serve as a predictive biomarker. Differential gene expression between the Responder and Non-Responder lines was performed using Significance Analysis of Microarray (see Supplementary Methods), with a false discovery rate limited to 10%. This resulted in 228 genes to further analyze for their relevance to the dasatinib response. The B-cell-receptor (BCR) pathway has been demonstrated to be active at different stages of B-cell development. Activation of various oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes gives rise to the malignancies at different stages of B-cell development (Fig. 1).

a1d523207691fb677e269915b865730c5dcabcf0,Title The Plasma Proteome Is Associated with Anthropometric Status of Undernourished Nepalese School-Aged Children Permalink,"Background: Malnutrition affects body growth, size, and composition of children. Yet, few functional biomarkers are known to be associated with childhood morphology. Objective: This cross-sectional study examined associations of anthropometric indicators of height, musculature, and fat mass with plasma proteins by using proteomics in a population cohort of school-aged Nepalese children. Methods: Height, weight, midupper arm circumference (MUAC), triceps and subscapular skinfolds, upper arm muscle area (AMA), and arm fat area (AFA) were assessed in 500 children 6â€“8 y of age. Height-for-age z scores (HAZs), weight-forage z scores (WAZs), and body mass indexâ€“for-age z scores (BAZs) were derived from the WHO growth reference. Relative protein abundance was quantified by using tandem mass spectrometry. Protein-anthropometry associations were evaluated by linear mixed-effects models and identified as having a false discovery rate (q) <5%. Results: Among 982 proteins, 1, 10, 14, and 17 proteinswere associatedwith BAZ, HAZ,MUAC, and AMA, respectively (q<0.05). Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, 2 IGF-binding proteins, and carnosinase-1were associatedwith bothHAZ andAMA. Proteins involved in nutrient transport, activation of innate immunity, and bone mineralization were associated with HAZ. Several extracellular matrix proteins were positively associated with AMA alone. The proteomes of MUAC and AMA substantially overlapped, whereas no proteins were associated with AFA or triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Myosin light-chain kinase, possibly reflecting leakage from muscle, was inversely associated with BAZ. The proteome of WAZ was the largest (n = 33) and most comprehensive, including proteins involved in neural development and oxidative stress response, among others. Conclusions: Plasma proteomics confirmed known biomarkers of childhood growth and revealed novel proteins associated with lean mass in chronically undernourished children. Identified proteins may serve as candidates for assessing growth and nutritional status of children in similar undernourished settings. The antenatal micronutrient supplementation trial yielding the study cohort of children was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00115271.

c02b29b24f81c7add2d1cd0a48a720b81b272964,Introduction of a new critical p value correction method for statistical significance analysis of metabonomics data,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabonomics is of growing importance for discovery of human disease biomarkers. Identification and validation of disease biomarkers using statistical significance analysis (SSA) is critical for translation to clinical practice. SSA is performed by assessing a null hypothesis test using a derivative of the Student's t test, e.g., a Welch's t test. Choosing how to correct the significance level for rejecting null hypotheses in the case of multiple testing to maintain a constant family-wise type I error rate is a common problem in such tests. The multiple testing problem arises because the likelihood of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e., a false positive, grows as the number of tests applied to the same data set increases. Several methods have been introduced to address this problem. Bonferroni correction (BC) assumes all variables are independent and therefore sacrifices sensitivity for detecting true positives in partially dependent data sets. False discovery rate (FDR) methods are more sensitive than BC but uniformly ascribe highest stringency to lowest p value variables. Here, we introduce standard deviation step down (SDSD), which is more sensitive and appropriate than BC for partially dependent data sets. Sensitivity and type I error rate of SDSD can be adjusted based on the degree of variable dependency. SDSD generates fundamentally different profiles of critical p values compared with FDR methods potentially leading to reduced type II error rates. SDSD is increasingly sensitive for more concentrated metabolites. SDSD is demonstrated using NMR-based metabonomics data collected on three different breast cancer cell line extracts.",2013,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Wang"", ids = ""144428328""); list(name = ""Zhanquan Shi"", ids = ""35288533""); list(name = ""Georg F.

76932d6493015f14d0af7c68e575ddb0799ef02e,Changes of DNA methylation are associated with changes in lung function during adolescence,"Adolescence is a significant period for the gender-dependent development of lung function. Prior studies have shown that DNA methylation (DNA-M) is associated with lung function and DNA-M at some cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide sites (CpGs) changes over time. This study examined whether changes of DNA-M at lung-function-related CpGs are associated with changes in lung function during adolescence for each gender, and if so, the biological significance of the detected CpGs. Genome-scale DNA-M was measured in peripheral blood samples at ages 10 (nâ€‰=â€‰330) and 18â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰476) from the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth cohort in United Kingdom, using Illumina Infinium arrays (450â€‰K and EPIC). Spirometry was conducted at both ages. A training and testing method was used to screen 402,714 CpGs for their potential associations with lung function. Linear regressions were applied to assess the association of changes in lung function with changes of DNA-M at those CpGs potentially related to lung function. Adolescence-related and personal and family-related confounders were included in the model. The analyses were stratified by gender. Multiple testing was adjusted by controlling false discovery rate of 0.05. Findings were further examined in two independent birth cohorts, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC) and the Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohort. Pathway analyses were performed on genes to which the identified CpGs were mapped. For females, 42 CpGs showed statistically significant associations with change in FEV1/FVC, but none for change in FEV1 or FVC. No CpGs were identified for males. In replication analyses, 16 and 21 of the 42 CpGs showed the same direction of associations among the females in the ALSPAC and BAMSE cohorts, respectively, with 11 CpGs overlapping across all the three cohorts. Through pathway analyses, significant biological processes were identified that have previously been related to lung function development. The detected 11 CpGs in all three cohorts have the potential to serve as the candidate epigenetic markers for changes in lung function during adolescence in females.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shadia Khan Sunny"", ids = ""84082518""); list(name = ""Hongmei Zhang"", ids = ""49723900""); list(name = ""Faisal I.

2d9d12f39905456ab8b6f5e91d3dbbaec88db004,Calibrating Thresholds to Improve the Detection Accuracy of Putative Transcription Factor Binding Sites,"To understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, it is essential to detect promoters and regulatory elements. Various kinds of methods have been introduced to improve the prediction accuracy of regulatory elements. Since there are few experimentally validated regulatory elements, previous studies have used criteria based solely on the level of scores over background sequences. However, selecting the detection criteria for different prediction methods is not feasible. Here, we studied the calibration of thresholds to improve regulatory element prediction. We predicted a regulatory element using MATCH, which is a powerful tool for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) detection. To increase the prediction accuracy, we used a regulatory potential (RP) score measuring the similarity of patterns in alignments to those in known regulatory regions. Next, we calibrated the thresholds to find relevant scores, increasing the true positives while decreasing possible false positives. By applying various thresholds, we compared predicted regulatory elements with validated regulatory elements from the Open Regulatory Annotation (ORegAnno) database. The predicted regulators by the selected threshold were validated through enrichment analysis of muscle-specific gene sets from the Tissue-Specific Transcripts and Genes (T-STAG) database. We found 14 known muscle-specific regulators with a less than a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) in a single TFBS analysis, as well as known transcription factor combinations in our combinatorial TFBS analysis.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Young-Jin Kim"", ids = ""3639357""); list(name = ""Gil-Mi Ryu"", ids = ""3032989""); list(name = ""Chan Park"", ids = ""144432061""); list(name = ""Kyu-Won Kim"", ids = ""119728659""); list(name = ""Bermseok Oh"", ids = ""49749977""); list(name = ""Young-Youl Kim"", ids = ""123634158""); list(name = ""Man Gu"", ids = ""50616193"")",,dff2b9cbc70e34bda57dd19b50c93b47e0b007f3; 06dddde0fad916b5609635c4312fa2a7958cc340; 199711ed8895351595cba3420f1d055b2a83365c; fec051093167682bf7b19e0fed03f16873e75c66; 7fce30e693714bbc3a6c83bcd049ccb8b97e660a; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; d2baca9aaf4c856a8b76cad2b17c13e8e8c1ef37; 03d1bcdd5c6b3e9a81249be5a91507487dbd13c3; ce13b1138ad369de3037de58739b6f3d82b2a780; 2ea087d9bbcbb7ec3ba1be149ee5a42d309d599c; f98dad9d65496b9dbfd4f924a2ac1d08f1ba7293; 1fcf323ff79c46b401e7a3d8510f50da17073cb8; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 1683b2475b40a0a0a88c5c57c8b717a5cd6aea4c; 8374aa9966fe9473e516097a6b72a1e5fc1bf268; d635663627605ff0c4eaebb58862351e15060061; 7f16cec1174f0e4d376acc9f72e0053c82f95950; 183f06cee98ee1901930f195d4c91e0428ee98aa; 8e6d4863c12b92f7bbf967b4f1def855cd6433df; 07cfe78da5d275ef46b301f9b441accd559227a2; 3a21e21e0a62c8fbd3be957cb28f4fd957807ff3; d3e37286204005aa96092f718f869ffddbc16e4f; 2de184d273e23749dbb33fceb5c2ac671077d673; 1b06cdf06bb350d75a191e7033c2306878d2fd99; 477fc8a99d875b342092110796dbea70abff21ea; 4c15da5c9c2026d5141dd1e8d9eda644dd681967; 6f961c7f32d2dd86922049f1a431ddc368f820dd; 2b4b7bf81570987e5674911254b1be637a8df3ce; 9d0708a0aafc914e2546218d6680b0fc10d75985; e7bb88353cb0a600c0acb482bc31fe3cdc88cb29; 30e5c0f3510e4f4967711c47fba55c482ff16883; 59797cfe154705428e6f19d3e0a320144faca1da; a46ff18942965c23c0a9c0fde451dfd6e2d291f5; e489d2cd9e347270a20ba91c43a46a04de4bc0b7; cd00243d9f5f87d0d800e4c6b5704d3dcc223654,Genomics & Informatics,5,143-151

We developed a multigene predictor of pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative weekly paclitaxel and fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (T/FAC) chemotherapy and assessed its predictive accuracy on independent cases.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred thirty-three patients with stage I-III breast cancer were included. Pretreatment gene expression profiling was performed with oligonecleotide microarrays on fine-needle aspiration specimens. We developed predictors of pCR from 82 cases and assessed accuracy on 51 independent cases.


RESULTS
Overall pCR rate was 26% in both cohorts. In the training set, 56 probes were identified as differentially expressed between pCR versus residual disease, at a false discovery rate of 1%. We examined the performance of 780 distinct classifiers (set of genes + prediction algorithm) in full cross-validation. Many predictors performed equally well. A nominally best 30-probe set Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier was selected for independent validation. It showed significantly higher sensitivity (92% v 61%) than a clinical predictor including age, grade, and estrogen receptor status. The negative predictive value (96% v 86%) and area under the curve (0.877 v 0.811) were nominally better but not statistically significant. The combination of genomic and clinical information yielded a predictor not significantly different from the genomic predictor alone. In 31 samples, RNA was hybridized in replicate with resulting predictions that were 97% concordant.


CONCLUSION
A 30-probe set pharmacogenomic predictor predicted pCR to T/FAC chemotherapy with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. This test correctly identified all but one of the patients who achieved pCR (12 of 13 patients) and all but one of those who were predicted to have residual disease had residual cancer (27 of 28 patients).",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kenneth R.

3840568ea7c493e5448b2506455e092d986a853f,RnaSeqSampleSize: real data based sample size estimation for RNA sequencing,"BackgroundOne of the most important and often neglected components of a successful RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiment is sample size estimation. A few negative binomial model-based methods have been developed to estimate sample size based on the parameters of a single gene. However, thousands of genes are quantified and tested for differential expression simultaneously in RNA-Seq experiments. Thus, additional issues should be carefully addressed, including the false discovery rate for multiple statistic tests, widely distributed read counts and dispersions for different genes.ResultsTo solve these issues, we developed a sample size and power estimation method named RnaSeqSampleSize, based on the distributions of gene average read counts and dispersions estimated from real RNA-seq data. Datasets from previous, similar experiments such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) can be used as a point of reference. Read counts and their dispersions were estimated from the referenceâ€™s distribution; using that information, we estimated and summarized the power and sample size. RnaSeqSampleSize is implemented in R language and can be installed from Bioconductor website. A user friendly web graphic interface is provided at http://cqs.mc.vanderbilt.edu/shiny/RnaSeqSampleSize/.ConclusionsRnaSeqSampleSize provides a convenient and powerful way for power and sample size estimation for an RNAseq experiment. It is also equipped with several unique features, including estimation for interested genes or pathway, power curve visualization, and parameter optimization.",2018,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shilin Zhao"", ids = ""47601208""); list(name = ""Chung-I Li"", ids = ""3420603""); list(name = ""Yan Guo"", ids = ""46791107""); list(name = ""Quanhu Sheng"", ids = ""143872309""); list(name = ""Shyr Yu"", ids = ""144112918"")",4cf642215349c4fecd463458c588d9b16a495776; bdfc61daf29de9204cf6c1c3f146d45a42758695; 86bcd6d4ba90860e6822611e78478e41a8f75048; ae2e5ed94bb999cf71c9627eaa117f108d922571; 95c2df26c1faa3d914eb2048098178acbc371604; 970ae652cac6c36a8dffe7dfbc2b25f4d01df5a0; 1286e41c05db196aeb67aded588aa06df2adbcc7; 727bef807477c2e7fc2333328a19422fdebbe525,385d419737ab1fee9271c74eaa32460d3c4d0e52; 8a2fa093d26ac42002900ae0accfb6b7733add71; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; 8072deb6718a5535045f548ae49ce2a7347a051f; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; bcf2cf850c73f98bfc918f6bfb45b1c9b9681018; d178b7d68d9b55a21710c27bdb4c1145be3c9e64; e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; f8dc73630864b4903f8f57b5c8d7b098eb300e4f; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; c1ea7e8c8542a305c2f1c771e0320bb9b578eeb4; 667f54da16b65cffa1372c320a8c9fec65b828be; 2c4272e5dd8a6f54caae33fec533ad5fc133c8c7; f4b1ced8fef31bb2fdb95fdd598a32d39f56b6cd; b5860253e015c27e8b125cf9b7ba2cb543dc36ed; 1f9c413f9ba5e3aea19880e5918318c1f0051437; 17868f976dd014be13acaf1ceff94c802abf14a0; 34148d0ba4cb59d4edeb782e5b62d87a0b74e71e; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; de377f87f114812ea9fbfa9b1c5e790506f3f08f; 03be636697c84eb22114f09de6c1bea215cc87c8; be413855aaf240e1c2d14c3559556f94cb3b23cb,BMC Bioinformatics,19,

 The increasing incidence of abiotic stresses and the limitations of available treatments, particularly in trees, highlight the need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of stress responses. In Arabidopsis, C-repeat binding factor 2 (CBF2) plays an important role in freezing tolerance and cold acclimation. Here, we isolated orthologs of CBF2 from five Populus species. Expression profiling revealed that the PopulusCBF2s were preferentially induced in response to cold, with CBF2 transcript abundances ranging from 5.4- to 62-fold higher than in unstressed controls of the corresponding species. In addition, we used a candidate gene-based approach in Populussimonii Carr. to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PsCBF2 associated with physiological and biochemical traits. PsCBF2 showed high nucleotide diversity (Ï€TÂ =Â 0.00549, Î¸wÂ =Â 0.01406) and low average linkage disequilibrium (r2Â =Â 0.061). Association studies in 528 individuals of an association population showed that nine SNPs (false discovery rate QÂ <Â 0.10) and one haplotype (QÂ <Â 0.10) were significantly associated with differences in four physiological and biochemical traits (PÂ <Â 0.005), with each marker explaining 1.31â€“5.87Â % of the total variance in the corresponding trait. PsCBF2 transcript levels differed significantly in abundance among genotypic classes for most of the significant SNPs. Identification of these significant associations will help reveal the molecular basis of physiological differences and provide a starting point for marker-assisted selection for traits involved in stress tolerance in P. simonii.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Li"", ids = ""1687893""); list(name = ""Baohua Xu"", ids = ""32782513""); list(name = ""Qingzhang Du"", ids = ""3873809""); list(name = ""Deqiang Zhang"", ids = ""39687013"")",bf8a7cf0e574532a4eed882d680691958f3f06ee; 178336b76cb607991ec5097ba620ff5d22c04136; 1be206721e777bfb89a41b8c15478255757383b7,812887c3730fedfbbe3a6236260cc01ca4849746; 53b9dfd0d72f94dba9ff1706297f999923b3e3f6; 3fd027618552891a00d3958518f79cbae1337dd2; b1ffd97f43c1c7e1275f304060bb874f31bc2d14; ba43a8da80964c02fde162434d36ed26af9a774a; c9acb84145dcb9d8632600fa4cddc7fc564f81fa; 39a77db7282569c6cf0fc6a3618f301d52ecb7f1; c18ee8e39d6bb7f695eac2894ce3f4870783f4f9; 5055c8cc24becffa3fdbb9d47fa539cccb48bf8b; cd4f1d47c79e3f87e37ba537d092ef2779864c95; 2ae26cc0295f67bd98bee973a06900dbeb7b03c9; 16df3d2459f7dc22b9d9f3c383b1ef7494f1bc7a; beb833d16c0d3cc82db16b07771dfe07bd050503; 9706693fbf62f0f09f6c9e81c603385fb1b30024; 2e1acdf3d0c1af91a64657b26ba7f2978e6a1b2b; 03cdcaea6e49f00b1ac30411de5bc1d843b1dce5; fb3f1dca22660493b451a417fac2eedf08d8594b; 2c7ccf403194086a7b59f6064aae76eb84cefb16; 2b73523c8882ad74b12690e1f1b0b2b564dbf563; 0430ddf89b16d5a54e38269564c5b454bf849f7e; c09d3bb9c998d95c011f3abb31a2a8f7bfbc1a22; ea3db91306fe387d4d404215d802c0bb958313a5; c5ef5f7782418ba4b9d7ca19b47252614bf61674; 53cca9a7fa67c1c8a87be649a2ceab2c394fcfa5; 665a1ff35896765333eeffc975272fa34f5548b8; 2c7dbc4225eddf4d00dd46ff5f8df683130a4971; 12c22de8b32d79a12ef584c949c4c29095da30e2; 2075dc09ad198f5d14e0324fa7a5c708376f5fad; 07d55c4f6dfbae9843f2c5dbff137d9b13a143eb; ff42536be21fa63cbc2aa39676645cad3d937df9; 93e8713cd1595af54d31e3dbfd09aae0684b80ed; ca1dbc700b753312e6c46f9dfbaa96c97ee9e39f; 48155286c0598962a415b07df3440e56adbd1e57; e9e1a49104a6e7509eb5c80c8846ac0818b2d61c; 161ef47b4f73a552afbf92db1b738861b3986554; 2dfa6721666e6ffdd15d8e24cc33cd3f5eac72d4; be63f2b289d7edcb525cad50af418d134f7615cc; ffe8922d882b49f78e5ad28a12c38a550a1d9c85; 88d8e3664363c2a052023d3e6261499fe62b8c13; edcf22019c6ddcdbe1af6211daacde20d6322cbf; 593ce127017f7cfc343be971f1ba9579a1408999; 17cc28c5d1204e0f3a689c11110149d02d46b54f; a6945d0b72e4f0f29993e0604e70be05eb26be33; dd60b8707bebefb04c05687e94db8673279ba1b1; dbf9707286c67b8fd361f442f14e1fb5b8d647fc; 16ac4d1af24a6174b0a5e1b6491424291d2973bb; c700eee5f49366deed6d15f625083709cd323485; 2861cce75da802bd99d9beb6d0073d4cc1eec1c8; 73a35991269620b1a841d86c7694a37b35052657; 39533098a76c237ff300a27ffc89b92432954657; 5123b376440f0d8a47d910819826380bbec45adb; f044ecf7be9d94be004ea69606601ed84c0a0a0f; cd775ccaecec36f4b78ced94430bbf008e7d9d05; 247ec8740ac7e1dedcd2436dbb2438b24a91207f; 6fa99e64380484c08acad8117b464dfe8af32c6a; 42b3781fa9a899cecd9141a4827f2f3372a1172d; ce43e0c3f1a7a7d98ce4724d3f0efdd0877a8a7e; 72ce6d7fed4e1fd07b2c87a7aa6a63d86e5e661a; 9d56653bb05dd0313089bea0b6a4bec67644430f; 609254885b8c1cd251061460f281bde3b9be5bb1; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c69be4b3f58244f0a439852165205890637d0e58; 5f680efc242ceaf7013c1137898edc01f349b998; ea16e9f7c97d97850d479e200a712a6a52a1dc1f; 1b77018aecb6e65f231b69416576de01606c7752; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 0e451fddf2419afa684d34d7be434362d6180404; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; dafbaffc46c34f26e73cd1fe95ea149983fe31a3; d770945aca83fb696323972db7d5ef93c516a752; b51d330f4a57e67b49edbf2eba12046fc9c10520; 9433adbfbdf5feb142cb344aaa9466413bf951bb; 0bb784881285af65aaf47f8cc9d101554450e4f8; 375adb91fe81bc29d37eda5c3112df93984b244f,Planta,242,295-312
643f6d48b2eacc4e603c754b2022ce1590e6446d,Limitation of algorithms for quantitative label-free LC-MS-based proteomics,"Abstract 
 
Over the past decade, mass spectrometry has had an essential role in improvement of proteomics techniques. New instrument and analytical protocol developments have made mass spectrometry one of the most widely used analytical methods in quantitative proteomics. Today one of the commonly used protocols in proteomics is digestion of proteins to peptides and analysis of the peptides with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS), with subsequent identification of the peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Quantification can be done on MS1 level by summing intensities of detected peaks (precursor intensity) or using counting of the MS/MS spectra (spectral counting). However, improvement in methods increases the amount of data and the data analysis of results from biological experiments involves several difficulties. 
Differentiations between peptide quantities can be found by comparing many samples from LC-MS. The comparison needs precise detection of peptides features in LC-MS spectra to allow matching between files. Mass changes in measurements and fluctuations in retention times (RT) make the matching process difficult. In this project we are trying to enable accurate peptide quantification based on LC-MS data, by first comparing and characterizing the pre-requirements for software used in the analysis process. 
 There are several algorithms used for peptide (feature) extraction from LC-MS data files. The different algorithms yielded different results and one of the challenges start from this point because we need to know which software and which parameter settings that are most reliable for covering many peptides with low false discovery rate. In the current project, MaxQuant is one of the common algorithms in label free quantitative proteomics detected more peptide features than OpenMS and MsInspect. 
Technical variation in different experiments has an important role in the results of the experiment, and can be used for assessing the performance of different quantification methods. In the second part of the project, technical variation was compared for analysis based on precursor intensity, spectral counting and total MS/MS intensity for two different datasets. The technical variation in the precursor-based analysis was higher than that achieved using spectral counting or total MS/MS intensity datasets. The results of the current project may be used to select the most appropriate analysis method for protein quantification.

Limitation of algorithms for quantitative label-free proteomics 
 
Although whole genome sequencing for many organisms is completed, many genes remain without assigned functions. To understand the function of each gene, new techniques for high throughput data generation have been envisaged. Proteomics is the study of the proteome, which is the collection of different proteins and their levels in a given cell or tissue. By comparing proteomes between samples one can get an idea about the role of different proteins in disease or biological processes. 
 
Proteomics can in this way help doctors and researchers to better diagnose and treat diseases. An aim is to find biological markers for disease to enable diagnosis and prognosis for personalized medicine. However, global protein analysis is difficult to perform, and involves complex protocols. One of the commonly used protocols in proteomics is digestion of proteins to peptides and analysis of peptides with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The output from this protocol are large amounts of data in the form of precursor spectra from analysis of intact peptides, and product spectra from the fragmentation of selected peptides. Analysis of the output data from the different protein quantification experiments is a very important and difficult stage of any experiment. 
 
Different labeling techniques are useful for comparing several samples in one analysis, as the signal from each sample can be distinguished by its label. However, the long procedure of introducing a label into proteins and the costs of labeling reagents makes it difficult. By eliminating any labels, dyes or specific reagents, label free method has been developed with high sensitivity. Label free quantification based on relative precursor ion intensity (precursor intensity) or based on the total number of identified product spectra from the protein (spectral counting) are used for quantification. 
 
There are several algorithms used for analyzing the data from peptide (feature) extraction and they yielded different results but we expected the same results for the same sample. We need to know which software and which parameter settings that are most reliable for covering many peptides with low FDR. In the current project, the output results from three common algorithms MaxQuant , MsInspect and OpenMS were compared. Perl scripts were used to process the data and further evaluation was done by plotting different aspects of the data. MaxQuant detected more peptide features than OpenMS and MsInspect. 
 
In the second sub project, different label free techniques were compared. One would expect a reliable method to show little variation between technical replicates. The technical variation in the precursor-based analysis was higher than that achieved using spectral counting datasets. It may relate to low abundance proteins as they make higher variation. The results of the current project may be used to select the most appropriate analysis method for protein quantification.

African Americans with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have a lower survival rate than whites. This study investigated the functional importance of ancestry-informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HNSCC and also examined the effect of functionally important genetic elements on racial disparities in HNSCC survival.


METHODS
Ancestry-informative SNPs, RNA sequencing, methylation, and copy number variation data for 316 oral cavity and laryngeal cancer patients were analyzed across 178 DNA repair genes. The results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses were also replicated with a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data set. The effects of eQTLs on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated.


RESULTS
Five ancestry-related SNPs were identified as cis-eQTLs in the DNA polymerase Î² (POLB) gene (false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰<â€‰0.01). The homozygous/heterozygous genotypes containing the African allele showed higher POLB expression than the homozygous white allele genotype (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). A replication study using a GEO data set validated all 5 eQTLs and also showed a statistically significant difference in POLB expression based on genetic ancestry (Pâ€‰=â€‰.002). An association was observed between these eQTLs and OS (Pâ€‰<â€‰.037; FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.0363) as well as DFS (Pâ€‰=â€‰.018 to .0629; FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.079) for oral cavity and laryngeal cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Genotypes containing the African allele were associated with poor OS/DFS in comparison with homozygous genotypes harboring the white allele.


CONCLUSIONS

85985b6e2b57d9c119c7d2ff1a456d13becb67df,A Combined Optimized Voxel-Based Morphometry and Resting State Functional Connectivity Investigation in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"Introduction Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested that deficits of the specific cortico-striato-thalamic-cortico (CSTC) circuits were related to the symptoms of OCD (1). Recent morphological MRI studies reported abnormal structural changes of hippocampus and cerebellum in OCD patients (2, 3). However no study has combined these two modalities to explore the whole brain anatomical and functional deficits in OCD yet. The purpose of the current study was to explore structural and functional deficits in OCD using optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity, and to investigate its relationship to clinical symptoms. Subjects and Methods The study was approved by the local ethical committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Twenty patients with OCD (aged 26.8 Â± 9.9 years; all right handed, diagnosis based on DSM-IV) and 20 age, sex and handedness matched healthy controls (aged 21.1 Â± 9.6 years) were recruited. The MRI examinations were performed via a 3-Telsa GE MRI system with an 8 channel phase array head coil. High resolution T1-weighted images were acquired by a volumetric 3D-SPGR sequence (TR/TE=8.5/3.4msec, flip angle=12Â°, slice thickness=1mm, 156 axial slices). The resting-state functional MR images sensitized to changes in BOLD signal levels were obtained via a GE-EPI sequence (TR/TE=2000/30msec, flip angle=90Â°, slice thickness=5mm with no gap, 30 axial slices, 200 volumes in each run). During MR examination, subjects were instructed to relax with their eyes closed without falling asleep. The high resolution T1-weighted images were preprocessed according to the optimized VBM protocol in SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Two-sample t-test was performed to test the differences of the gray matter volume (GMV) of the OCD patients and controls. The functional connectivity was examined using a method based on a seed voxel correlation approach. The DPARSF software (http://www.restfmri.net) was used to calculate the parametric maps of functional connectivity. For patient data, individual parametric maps of functional connectivity were analyzed with one-sample t-test to identify voxels showing a significant positive or negative correlation to the seed time series using a family-wise error (FWE) correction at P<0.05. For between-group comparison, two-sample t-tests were performed to compare parametric maps of functional connectivity between OCD patients and controls in SPM5. A P value of less than 0.05 was deemed to be significant. Results After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, OCD patients demonstrated increased GMV in bilateral thalamus and left cerebellum compared to controls (Figure 1). The mean value of bilateral thalamus volume in OCD patients was positively correlated (2-tailed Pearson r=0.94, P<0.001). There are no significant correlations between the increased GMV and any clinical measures. Since VBM analysis showed increased GMV in the left and right thalamus and left cerebellum, each of these three regions were defined as seeds for functional connectivity analysis. When the seeds were located in the left and right thalamus respectively, both OCD patients and controls showed significant positive correlations between the seeds and the activity in the bilateral thalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, hippocampus, parietal cortex, insula and brainstem. The left cerebellum seed region in both groups only showed positive functional connectivity with the bilateral cerebellum regions.",2010,,"list(name = ""Feng Li"", ids = ""144159214""); list(name = ""Bin Li"", ids = ""48218850""); list(name = ""Su Lui"", ids = ""145965434""); list(name = ""Xiaoshan Huang"", ids = ""2519629""); list(name = ""Qizhu Wu"", ids = ""1965983""); list(name = ""Lin-qiu Qiu"", ids = ""31818000""); list(name = ""Yan-Chang Yang"", ids = ""119607628""); list(name = ""Qiyong Gong"", ids = ""153863271"")",,,,,
2477d47e0eeefa8de23c54604695daad25ec7d8d,Transcriptome analysis of callus from Picea balfouriana,"BackgroundPicea likiangensis var. balfouriana (Rehd. et Wils.) Hillier ex Slavin (also known as Picea balfouriana) is an ecologically and economically important conifer that grows rapidly under optimum conditions and produces high-quality wood. It has a wide geographic distribution and is prevalent in southwest and eastern regions of China. Under suboptimal conditions, P. balfouriana grows slowly, which restricts its cultivation. Somatic embryogenesis has been used in the mass propagation of commercial species. However, low initiation rates are a common problem and the mechanisms involved in the induction of somatic embryogenesis are not fully understood. To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating somatic embryogenesis in P. balfouriana, high-throughput RNA-seq technology was used to investigate the transcriptomes of embryogenic and non-embryogenic tissues from three P. balfouriana genotypes. We compared the genes expressed in these tissues to identify molecular markers with embryogenic potential.ResultsA total of 55,078,846 nucleotide sequence reads were obtained for the embryogenic and non-embryogenic tissues of P. balfouriana, and 49.56% of them uniquely matched 22,295 (84.3%) of the 26,437 genes in the Picea abies genome database (Nature 497: 579-584, 2013). Differential gene expression analysis identified 1,418 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate <0.0001; fold change â‰¥2) in the embryogenic tissues relative to the non-embryogenic tissues, including 431 significantly upregulated and 987 significantly downregulated genes. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis revealed that the most significantly altered genes were involved in plant hormone signal transduction, metabolic pathways (starch and sucrose metabolism), and phenylalanine metabolism.ConclusionsWe found that the initiation of embryogenic tissues affected gene expression in many KEGG pathways, but predominantly in plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, and starch and sucrose metabolism. The changes in multiple pathways related to induction in the P. balfouriana embryogenic tissues described here, will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in the initiation of somatic embryogenesis. Additionally, we found that somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK), arabinogalactan proteins, and members of the WUS-related homeobox protein family may play important roles and could act as molecular markers in the early stage of somatic embryogenesis, as reported previously.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qingfen Li"", ids = ""48934117""); list(name = ""Shougong Zhang"", ids = ""3189367""); list(name = ""Junhui Wang"", ids = ""3255094"")",8073bd35fd47a17c198abd08f5796db777e5c585; 8b808929635a6c63e33c23123edf681fbd5b9538; fe5a1715a679917727359d55f73fe8c9fd87f50a; 0565ed72080c764908598bcaf6e91c1efb91a9e6; 92383a025312dd273aa814c77ccb1c2b7074e1f0; 4476e570118836905e17611385bb7e986edff76d; dc03dcfca98fd705c3a1f29686cecba69faad64f; 5550de52c5ae1a824b8a513ace61fec765b8501d; ff7cc7efe82dd188b40dd828611810be8ce9c090; ee4ccc5d80a38ab2d5de0641f64b11334ba7645e; 8393dbe844772c3827f001b7c3648e56c1fd5910; 8d1d0ba37978a1da74fa8ae6309097126275db1c; 4c2998749228511e2f34429b86242160cdc2d63e; 59673246905659c67ee37f2735ff1650902e7d95; 2477d47e0eeefa8de23c54604695daad25ec7d8d; 4e7295239d398d47b583fd7b94065b2dec16a909; 836573b843d7b04c77f8647a4448c2e66e0e0147; 6e0704369d467d01f524962c7e0734864c1ee6fc,df424a931a15fe2d2414248307edcb2f703ce1c5; c6c20e478691c636132965b85d5542bc1879849c; c106cb3d0d1b163009a4dcc97102b76b9485a84e; 7660ac53b505d2a86403c2ac112a40a1f2e1037e; c8988b78dafc8ed57fa3468a09ea208827019b85; 6592cadeb67f07c38783f575914c58e02ab92851; 72aceb06f33d13a2ec6a09819c431c4eaca90e77; c02a9806df6c3dc37c7f719510f87581c1d39f36; 5787c55edbb6a26186d0d47c913f4f84de6d4813; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 2201fa60a34a176eccb7eb27587c70fc7ff9dd79; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; 9f00a8559d9f408f3d765fc05911e14c437147d6; 29cc6b8f27e15d9bc3b414a605f0852c2613fbeb; 6aa5e03b8d8bd403c4fe9fb40179cc5e55e98ead; 0a9151bbdf1dd0911b96198341fec14021ceef40; 159a310b614fb14c20487758422afc93dc5d7c0f; a7e1ddf11a5cfcbccebfabd6f67e88268b3138a7; 15d63d21db8364fd35fdba15e99839ad54c49db8; d24bea01f709c43d1771ce7ae1d47b606a6ad997; d64cc6ddc2edc5f4a6588899ec36800a9c5e4414; a53c6ca9d589c9c6ebc109774c22c0640e3adc09; 84129f91f0a5a3745d0a1ebfbe7a5647475beb08; 61156ded78fb2bec0dbff2ff66ac799d00458058; dd9795f73d5a1cafced75762c5eb5099136bba47; 06dc46e7320f6a4bc73a38416caef2415f9ff1e0; 2a434d952ce1f7df4051f1b1d65c4b0d532c6539; f37df22264ecab5675cf1fd95fba2f3bfb2e063b; a7b46e5fb176d64668911052bf544f81bf37612d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 30f2972481404d9d3083d8d246f0356659cfe15c; f0ae10f2e769646bdeed294f1f318dcc5cf8b37d; 1e4a97c876b646b40cec28d2a86109b45d07e9a9; 8dbad2d4d378c78bc214ea5fe74c31285b1c2988; 2477d47e0eeefa8de23c54604695daad25ec7d8d; 4a4d5ae62e3fb75389d3b807dfbeec24a96d0b36; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; d8583b3fcbfc277dfbcf942f8b300df256d05c0a; fb5bf1f64ee688b7ae436f49c13a54998ef9db45; 615c1290de02777dc52f25bc695bebaa3c35b009; f21d6852da12b3ed8e4ce490c0020c836cbb55ef; 2449e1d56a843cb6e280852d787143479d776ce6; 447bf5edc72aa9b8c96f841ff11e8f47e89d2ec4; aab14be5ca2013663599eb86a65660628659db85; 939110d8e3a026892e63003b8948a00412f96fee; f5771ead162443c2d587af149bb154c20bbb4ebf; e695841098a3c1f4b7870a5da319dc551496880b; 60e875acbc33effa89972759c2ab5421e1ea6567; 88908981f8b2a4965800059e0709a7d7a36e9089; 0832ea5541859aedf17e495263f64e9b869ddc6a; 0a859b9080c175ef35ea7d4849c28182c2554a25; a9c8130cf93080224e960f0dd0c46bd236cc6282; a36b70ce62752f1fbf96961f126dbb0618685b69; 3d4c15873b4bbb771c551547c028fd6b2aab7ff4; 437772d38f1b28343508d6ab45d4d1d73de987d4; 39e75fe10d46919ee6dcda6ce9288cb2c22cad7b,BMC Genomics,15,
604f9541a28bdcd56f2e69e3b6044e78e319d51e,Use of the false discovery rate when comparing multiple health care providers.,"OBJECTIVE
Comparisons of the performance of multiple health care providers are often based on hypothesis tests, those with resulting P-values below some critical threshold being identified as potentially extreme. Because of the multiple testing involved, the classical P-value threshold of, say, 0.05 may not be considered strict enough, as it will tend to lead to too many ""false positives."" However, we argue that the commonly used Bonferroni-corrected threshold is in general too strict for the problem in hand. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate a suitable alternative thresholding procedure that is already well established in other fields.


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
The suggested procedure involves control of an error measure called the ""false discovery rate"" (FDR). We present a worked example involving a comparison of risk-adjusted mortality rates following heart surgery in New York State hospitals during 2000-2002. It is shown that the FDR critical threshold lines can be drawn on a ""funnel plot,"" providing a simple graphical presentation of the results.


RESULTS
The FDR procedure identified more providers as potentially extreme than the Bonferroni correction, while maintaining control of an intuitively sensible error measure.


CONCLUSION

c1639a9fede2e3810ecf5a5bf43a9ce674d79f4c,Mapping protease inhibitor resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 sequence polymorphisms within patients.,"Resistance genotyping provides an important resource for the clinical management of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, resistance to protease (PR) inhibitors (PIs) is a complex phenotype shaped by interactions among nearly half of the residues in HIV-1 PR. Previous studies of the genetic basis of PI resistance focused on fixed substitutions among populations of HIV-1, i.e., host-specific adaptations. Consequently, they are susceptible to a high false discovery rate due to founder effects. Here, we employ sequencing ""mixtures"" (i.e., ambiguous base calls) as a site-specific marker of genetic variation within patients that is independent of the phylogeny. We demonstrate that the transient response to selection by PIs is manifested as an excess of nonsynonymous mixtures. Using a sample of 5,651 PR sequences isolated from both PI-naive and -treated patients, we analyze the joint distribution of mixtures and eight PIs as a Bayesian network, which distinguishes residue-residue interactions from direct associations with PIs. We find that selection for resistance is associated with the emergence of nonsynonymous mixtures in two distinct groups of codon sites clustered along the substrate cleft and distal regions of PR, respectively. Within-patient evolution at several positions is independent of PIs, including those formerly postulated to be involved in resistance. These positions are under strong positive selection in the PI-naive patient population, implying that other factors can produce spurious associations with resistance, e.g., mutational escape from the immune response.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Art F.

fe5e6c894e8fe340e885a20777e8ab6e141e8182,Global discovery of high-NaCl-induced changes of protein phosphorylation.,"High extracellular NaCl, such as in the renal medulla, can perturb and even kill cells, but cells mount protective responses that enable them to survive and function. Many high-NaCl-induced perturbations and protective responses are known, but the signaling pathways involved are less clear. Change in protein phosphorylation is a common mode of cell signaling, but there was no unbiased survey of protein phosphorylation in response to high NaCl. We used stable isotopic labeling of amino acids in cell culture coupled to mass spectrometry to identify changes in protein phosphorylation in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells exposed to high NaCl. We reproducibly identify >8,000 unique phosphopeptides in 4 biological replicate samples with a 1% false discovery rate. High NaCl significantly changed phosphorylation of 253 proteins. Western analysis and targeted ion selection mass spectrometry confirm a representative sample of the phosphorylation events. We analyze the affected proteins by functional category to infer how altered protein phosphorylation might signal cellular responses to high NaCl, including alteration of cell cycle, cyto/nucleoskeletal organization, DNA double-strand breaks, transcription, proteostasis, metabolism of mRNA, and cell death.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Rong Wang"", ids = ""144588331""); list(name = ""Joan D.

455ad9724760088bf5b747baf5ea846b6f5e6214,High-dimensional gene expression profiling studies in high and low responders to primary smallpox vaccination.,"BACKGROUND
The mechanisms underlying smallpox vaccine-induced variations in immune responses are not well understood, but are of considerable interest to a deeper understanding of poxvirus immunity and correlates of protection.


METHODS
We assessed transcriptional messenger RNA expression changes in 197 recipients of primary smallpox vaccination representing the extremes of humoral and cellular immune responses.


RESULTS
The 20 most significant differentially expressed genes include a tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily member, an interferon (IFN) gene, a chemokine gene, zinc finger protein genes, nuclear factors, and histones (P â‰¤ 1.06E(-20), q â‰¤ 2.64E(-17)). A pathway analysis identified 4 enriched pathways with cytokine production by the T-helper 17 subset of CD4+ T cells being the most significant pathway (P = 3.42E(-05)). Two pathways (antiviral actions of IFNs, P = 8.95E(-05); and IFN-Î±/Î² signaling pathway, P = 2.92E(-04)), integral to innate immunity, were enriched when comparing high with low antibody responders (false discovery rate, < 0.05). Genes related to immune function and transcription (TLR8, P = .0002; DAPP1, P = .0003; LAMP3, P = 9.96E(-05); NR4A2, P â‰¤ .0002; EGR3, P = 4.52E(-05)), and other genes with a possible impact on immunity (LNPEP, P = 3.72E(-05); CAPRIN1, P = .0001; XRN1, P = .0001), were found to be expressed differentially in high versus low antibody responders.

We identified novel and known immunity-related genes and pathways that may account for differences in immune response to smallpox vaccination.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Iana H.

However, in conducting a large number of simultaneous hypothesis tests, the WRAF is prone to identifying false â€œdiscoveries.â€ A common technique for addressing this multiple testing problem is to adjust the procedure in a way that controls the proportion of true null hypotheses that are incorrectly rejected, or the false discovery rate (FDR). Unfortunately, generic FDR procedures suffer from low power when the hypotheses are dependent, and techniques designed to account for dependence are sensitive to misspecification of the underlying statistical model. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian decision theoretic approach for dependent multiple testing and a nonparametric hierarchical statistical model that flexibly controls false discovery and is ro...",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Mark D.

Liver from five Holstein cows was biopsied at -65, -30, -14, +1, +14, +28, and +49 days relative to parturition for transcript profiling using a microarray consisting of 7,872 annotated cattle cDNA inserts. More than 5,000 cDNA elements represented on the microarray were expressed in liver. From this set we identified 62 differentially expressed genes related to physiological state, with a false discovery rate threshold of P = 0.20. The dominant expression pattern consisted of upregulation from day -30 through day +1, followed by downregulation through day +28. There was a threefold decrease from day -65 through day +14 in expression of IGFBP3, GSTM5, and PDPK1. These genes mediate IGF-I transport, oxidative stress, and glucose homeostasis, respectively. IGFBP3, EIF4B, and GSTM5 mRNA levels were positively correlated with blood serum total protein. Correlation analysis showed positive associations between serum nonesterified fatty acids and mRNA expression for SAA1, CPT1A, ACADVL, and TFAP2A. Transcript levels of ACSL1, PPARA, and TFAP2A were positively correlated with serum beta-hydroxybutyrate. Expression patterns for certain genes (e.g., IGFBP3, HNF4A, GPAM) revealed adaptations commencing well ahead of parturition, suggesting they are regulated by factors other than periparturient hormonal environment. Results provide evidence that hepatic inflammatory responses occurring near parturition initiate or augment adipose catabolism. In this context, cytokines, acute-phase proteins, and serum nonesterified fatty acids are key players in periparturient cow metabolism. We propose a model for integrating gene expression, metabolite, and liver composition data to explain physiological events in placenta, adipose, and liver during the periparturient period.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Juan J.

3d3fb10f564582970a069bcf561e3123ae1b8fd2,Visceral adipose tissue but not subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated with urine and serum metabolites,"Obesity is a complex multifactorial phenotype that influences several metabolic pathways. Yet, few studies have examined the relations of different body fat compartments to urinary and serum metabolites. Anthropometric phenotypes (visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the ratio between VAT and SAT (VSR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and urinary and serum metabolite concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured in a population-based sample of 228 healthy adults. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, were used to associate anthropometric phenotypes with metabolites. We adjusted for potential confounding variables: age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary glucose, and fasting status. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model dichotomized for the absence or presence of quantifiable metabolite amounts, VAT, BMI and WC were inversely related to urinary choline (ÃŸ = -0.18, p = 2.73*10-3), glycolic acid (ÃŸ = -0.20, 0.02), and guanidinoacetic acid (ÃŸ = -0.12, p = 0.04), and positively related to ethanolamine (ÃŸ = 0.18, p = 0.02) and dimethylamine (ÃŸ = 0.32, p = 0.02). BMI and WC were additionally inversely related to urinary glutamine and lactic acid. Moreover, WC was inversely associated with the detection of serine. VAT, but none of the other anthropometric parameters, was related to serum essential amino acids, such as valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine among men. Compared to other adiposity measures, VAT demonstrated the strongest and most significant relations to urinary and serum metabolites. The distinct relations of VAT, SAT, VSR, BMI, and WC to metabolites emphasize the importance of accurately differentiating between body fat compartments when evaluating the potential role of metabolic regulation in the development of obesity-related diseases, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Inga Schlecht"", ids = ""34964824""); list(name = ""Wolfram Gronwald"", ids = ""145211479""); list(name = ""Gundula Behrens"", ids = ""11354945""); list(name = ""Sebastian E.

The size and complexity of proteomics data hinders efforts to easily share, integrate, query and compare the studies. The Model Organism Protein Expression Database (MOPED, htttp://moped.proteinspire.org) is a new and expanding proteomics resource that enables rapid browsing of protein expression information from publicly available studies on humans and model organisms. MOPED is designed to simplify the comparison and sharing of proteomics data for the greater research community. MOPED uniquely provides protein level expression data, meta-analysis capabilities and quantitative data from standardized analysis. Data can be queried for specific proteins, browsed based on organism, tissue, localization and condition and sorted by false discovery rate and expression. MOPED empowers users to visualize their own expression data and compare it with existing studies. Further, MOPED links to various protein and pathway databases, including GeneCards, Entrez, UniProt, KEGG and Reactome. The current version of MOPED contains over 43,000 proteins with at least one spectral match and more than 11 million high certainty spectra.",2012,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Eugene Kolker"", ids = ""2823712"");

8e9cf414ffa0cc9d20184b0338e71078e6a196f8,Transcriptional profiling identifies differentially expressed genes in developing turkey skeletal muscle,"BackgroundSkeletal muscle growth and development from embryo to adult consists of a series of carefully regulated changes in gene expression. Understanding these developmental changes in agriculturally important species is essential to the production of high quality meat products. For example, consumer demand for lean, inexpensive meat products has driven the turkey industry to unprecedented production through intensive genetic selection. However, achievements of increased body weight and muscle mass have been countered by an increased incidence of myopathies and meat quality defects. In a previous study, we developed and validated a turkey skeletal muscle-specific microarray as a tool for functional genomics studies. The goals of the current study were to utilize this microarray to elucidate functional pathways of genes responsible for key events in turkey skeletal muscle development and to compare differences in gene expression between two genetic lines of turkeys. To achieve these goals, skeletal muscle samples were collected at three critical stages in muscle development: 18d embryo (hyperplasia), 1d post-hatch (shift from myoblast-mediated growth to satellite cell-modulated growth by hypertrophy), and 16wk (market age) from two genetic lines: a randombred control line (RBC2) maintained without selection pressure, and a line (F) selected from the RBC2 line for increased 16wk body weight. Array hybridizations were performed in two experiments: Experiment 1 directly compared the developmental stages within genetic line, while Experiment 2 directly compared the two lines within each developmental stage.ResultsA total of 3474 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate; FDR < 0.001) by overall effect of development, while 16 genes were differentially expressed (FDR < 0.10) by overall effect of genetic line. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis was used to group annotated genes into networks, functions, and canonical pathways. The expression of 28 genes involved in extracellular matrix regulation, cell death/apoptosis, and calcium signaling/muscle function, as well as genes with miscellaneous function was confirmed by qPCR.ConclusionsThe current study identified gene pathways and uncovered novel genes important in turkey muscle growth and development.

b77c931f152a371754cfc516cd116d552b9d46f0,Expanding the yeast protein arginine methylome.,"Protein arginine methylation is a PTM involved in various cellular processes in eukaryotes. Recent discoveries led to a vast expansion of known sites in higher organisms, indicating that this modification is more widely spread across the proteome than previously assumed. An increased knowledge of sites in lower eukaryotes may facilitate the elucidation of its functions. In this study, we present the discovery of arginine mono-methylation sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a combination of immunoaffinity enrichment and MS/MS. As detection of methylation is prone to yield false positives, we demonstrate the need for stringent measures to avoid elevated false discovery rates. To this end, we employed MethylSILAC in combination with a multistep data analysis strategy. We report 41 unambiguous methylation sites on 13 proteins. Our results indicate that, while substantially less abundant, arginine methylation follows similar patterns as in higher eukaryotes in terms of sequence context and functions of methylated proteins. The majority of sites occur on RNA-binding proteins participating in processes from transcription and splicing to translation and RNA degradation. Additionally, our data suggest a bias for localization of arginine methylation in unstructured regions of proteins, which frequently involves Arg-Gly-Gly motifs or Asn-rich contexts.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Plank"", ids = ""48473979""); list(name = ""Roman Fischer"", ids = ""145228150""); list(name = ""Vincent L.

4db54a5e87a81a1591dfb8a567739964c5db7295,Are more genes better in clinical-genomic studies? A mathematical model to define identification power for clinically relevant genes.,"e22136 Background: Modern molecular technologies that drive personalized medicine can generate expression data for thousands of candidate genes, or indeed, data for the ""whole genome"". Clinical-genomic studies aim to identify genes that are truly associated with clinical outcome. We investigated the impact of large numbers of genes with little or no association with clinical outcome on the statistical power of studies to identify individual genes with strong association.


METHODS
We adapted Efron's (Ann Stat 2007) empirical Bayes approach to develop a method to calculate the identification power for individual genes in analyses that control the false discovery rate (FDR), the expected proportion of false positives. The identification power is the probability that a gene with a given true magnitude of association with clinical outcome will be identified when we control the FDR at a specified level. The identification power also depends on the proportion of genes studied that are not associated with outcome and the distribution of the degree of association among genes that are.


RESULTS
The identification power for clinically relevant genes decreases dramatically as the proportion of genes having no association with clinical outcome increases. For example, in a scenario in which 100 genes have some association with clinical outcome [median hazard ratio (HR) 1.125], increasing the number of genes having no association from 400 to 4000 decreases the identification power an individual gene having strong association (HR 1.42) from 80% to 36%. Similarly, when the number of genes having no association is 400 and the median HR among the 100 genes that have an association is decreased from 1.125 to 1.06, identification power for a gene with an association HR of 1.42 decreases from 80% to 62%.


CONCLUSIONS
Identification power can be used to optimize strategies for gene finding and enable personalized medicine. Although technology allows the assay of ever-increasing numbers of genes, inclusion in a single study of many genes unrelated to clinical outcome is detrimental to the identification power for clinically relevant genes. Even with increased power, replication of results in independent studies will continue to be critically important.

Although extensively characterized, the functional consequence of APA modulation on tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we developed a deep sequencing-based approach that specifically profiles 3' termini of polyadenylated RNAs (herein termed 3T-seq) and analyzed APA events in two gastric cancer cell lines and one non-transformed counterpart. Overall, we identified >28 000 poly(A) sites, 70% of which are potentially novel. Further, we observed widespread APA-mediated 3' UTR shortening of 513 genes (false discovery rate < 0.05) across gastric cancer genome. We characterized one of these genes, NET1, in detail and found that the shortening of NET1 3' UTR significantly enhances transcriptional activity. Moreover, the NET1 isoform with short 3' UTR promotes cellular migration and invasion in vitro. Collectively, our work provides an effective approach for genome-wide APA site profiling and reveals a link between APA modulation and gastric cancer metastasis.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Deng-Pan Lai"", ids = ""50375220""); list(name = ""Sheng Neng Tan"", ids = ""39553256""); list(name = ""Ya-ni Kang"", ids = ""4621095""); list(name = ""Jingjing Wu"", ids = ""38928373""); list(name = ""Hong-Sain Ooi"", ids = ""49211370""); list(name = ""Jian Jhen Chen"", ids = ""47740650""); list(name = ""Ting-ting Shen"", ids = ""50309311""); list(name = ""Ying Lean Qi"", ids = ""1720322""); list(name = ""Xiaoli Zhang"", ids = ""145185728""); list(name = ""Yan Guo"", ids = ""46791107""); list(name = ""Tao Zhu"", ids = ""144237204""); list(name = ""Bingya Liu"", ids = ""50677910""); list(name = ""Zhifeng Shao"", ids = ""144417016""); list(name = ""Xiaodong Zhao"", ids = ""47040125"")",4cf522620d67e2d736c5397e516dd0f9924456ce; 97abf08f6fb84db19a72fa33dfe4760ef4fb5472; 4a3b6434f2ecbb7d4f64792466ba6cef6b405746; 1ae9068d36e34366560f9bcc742ae48eed9584a6; 31fe731fc4c435552bf2a925e3bbd2deb3f5686d; f8f95f2c301d44e30ff575130c243e302f779015; a7e13254f1c2ab81fc348c19f00f784a778358ff; 1284b25c2c3efbd9f8846c5cb09a0ef93ae0ff84; 91cd297e4a4208e08150810caad49085301774fa; 5cc7f74b38e723332047fb8700d2aa9708cf5936; 63b37c9315d7c2080e635e0cb343d26d80d90f5b; 5ccb51f151b419728f03301ae5393eb2f468bae7; 088f99c4f04e3f943f478fa31cc1f6cdd144e243; 932c65bbb3f95401ba88fe0b35e206b7034ce5a3; 57d1abc605e02481d6e3d5155d8314000b25c038; 26889ec6d81ac0a4aab8d434620bfa235946bb5f,,Human molecular genetics,24 12,"

03b7f8450dfb11bd1b130cb22de142f1091b7e81,"Nicotine withdrawal sensitivity, linkage to chr6q26, and association of OPRM1 SNPs in the SMOking in FAMilies (SMOFAM) sample.","BACKGROUND
Nicotine withdrawal symptoms are related to smoking cessation. A Rasch model has been used to develop a unidimensional sensitivity score representing multiple correlated measures of nicotine withdrawal. A previous autosome-wide screen identified a nonparametric linkage (NPL) log-likelihood ratio (LOD) score of 2.7 on chromosome 6q26 for the sum of nine withdrawal symptoms.


METHODS
The objectives of these analyses were to (a) assess the influence of nicotine withdrawal sensitivity on relapse, (b) conduct autosome-wide NPL analysis of nicotine withdrawal sensitivity among 158 pedigrees with 432 individuals with microsatellite genotypes and nicotine withdrawal scores, and (c) explore family-based association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the mu opioid receptor candidate gene (OPRM1) with nicotine withdrawal sensitivity in 172 nuclear pedigrees with 419 individuals with both SNP genotypes and nicotine withdrawal scores.


RESULTS
An increased risk for relapse was associated with nicotine withdrawal sensitivity score (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.42). A maximal NPL LOD score of 3.15, suggestive of significant linkage, was identified at chr6q26 for nicotine withdrawal sensitivity. Evaluation of 18 OPRM1 SNPs via the family-based association test with the nicotine withdrawal sensitivity score identified eight tagging SNPs with global P values <0.05 and false discovery rate Q values <0.06.


CONCLUSION
An increased risk of relapse, suggestive linkage at chr6q26, and nominally significant association with multiple OPRM1 SNPs were found with Rasch-modeled nicotine withdrawal sensitivity scores in a multiplex smoking pedigree sample. Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings and investigate the relationship between nicotine withdrawal symptoms and variation at OPRM1.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jill Hardin"", ids = ""40179551""); list(name = ""Yungang He"", ids = ""6779488""); list(name = ""Harold S.

There are currently no well-defined biomarkers of response to treatment that can be used to guide treatment or evaluate recovery in this patient population. APPROACH: In the present study we characterized the levels of novel and emerging circulatingHF biomarkers of HF in patients with severe inotrope-dependent AHF over the first 30 days of medical management or mechanical circulatory support (MCS). We hypothesized that there would be a shared treatment response identifiable in both patient groups, particularly a plasma proteomic signature of inotrope-dependent AHF reversal. DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled a prospective cohort of 25 consecutive patients >19 years of age and supported on at least one inotrope, admitted to St. Paulâ€™s Hospital with AHF. Peripheral blood samples were collected at days 1, 7 and 30 post-admission. Analysis of peripheral blood proteomic biomarkers was performed using semi-targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM) and candidate marker antibody arrays. A subset of patients managed medically who survived to 30 days post-admission without the need for cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support (n1â„48), and patients receiving implantable MCS (n1â„45) were selected for this analysis. Time course plasma samples from the first 30 days of therapy underwent biomarker analyses to generate biomarker signatures characteristic of the response to each treatment modality. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using robust limma with p <0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 for MRM and antibody array data. RESULTS: We identified a set of 6 in-common plasma proteins which are differentially regulated in both treatment groups, and two proteins uniquely associated with each therapeutic intervention. Patients managed medically or with implantable MCS had increases in circulating cardiotrophin 1, cardiac troponin T, clusterin, and dickopff 1. Levels of c-reactive protein and growth differentiation factor 15 decreased in both groups over the 30-day time course. CONCLUSION: We have characterized the temporal proteomic signature of clinical recovery in AHF patients managed medically or with MCS, over the first 30 days of treatment. Changes in biomarker expression over the time course may enhance understanding of the biological basis of AHF, including the identification of novel markers and mechanisms of recovery.

66bc5f9640ce69c3c992a7a0d6cf74ca64d8592a,Multiplicity issues in microarray experiments.,"OBJECTIVES
Discussion of different error concepts relevant to microarray experiments. Review of some commonly used multiple testing procedures. Comparison of different approaches as applied to gene expression data.


METHODS
This article focuses on familywise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures. Methods under investigation include: Bonferroni-type methods and their improvements (including resampling approaches), modified Bonferroni methods, data-driven approaches, as well as the linear step-up method and its modifications. Particular emphasis lies on the description of the assumptions, advantages and limitations for the investigated methods.


RESULTS
FWER controlling procedures are often too conservative in high dimensional screening studies. A better balance between the raw P-values and the stringent FWER-adjusted P-values may be required in many situations, as provided by FDR controlling and related procedures.


CONCLUSIONS
The questions remain open, which error concept to apply and which multiple testing procedure to use. Although we believe that the FDR or one of its variants will be applied more often in the future, longterm experience with microarray technology is missing and thus the validity of appropriate multiple test procedures cannot yet be assessed for microarray data analysis.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Frank Bretz"", ids = ""1680202""); list(name = ""Jobst Landgrebe"", ids = ""1713519""); list(name = ""Edgar Brunner"", ids = ""31820117"")",a4c9f06ba9f94c09ffda0bb5148973b9b92016e8; 417199a6875d57955bfe73bbd2c5f01556998c25; c65dd7cf937bf210b0f8c35d777410c40e4e2b30; 6fb51cc4ee63a869068617f87b36060ecb3e5701; ecd556fc8edae00c9587ff1c62543f00c1fd30ca; f8428e38ee653de3c4373c4cefa5d8f6fca5745a; 590344aaf6f86c5fc48c0613af31eb3e5a85c5cd; 542c766ae5cbf528d68c3a51fcc1cbac5502ee61; 56cb39e25d0d74361c98845bf03027515b94e8da; 440600adf74c9a3e4f458c38b83b75bd8dc2c686; b19938f67ed5d6249126abc85d647479e18bb6d9; 71f452c55ac53e9408497509d35f2bc763156519; 56fbf6c63304bc82193bf4a8789383e8710112d0; d4b04f73a932ea71239a465119ac892beee47143; d0e1d5778df11fa81f3a2c4317a3b457fae6cdd2; 9cd70df2272fe712588c5fe6d03aa9426f251055; f289cb4cfcce871e42d2765a0904548252421742; 4dfeeae03277b06c30f66a62ba27116f47535bda; c658930e46c5be74e29be60310cf8849829014a4; 8a9a57f65fe8e134be98045d1e4cb01e63076ad0; c2e54c8ef47668c415a4377a45b5b32b8d428127; e0bd5f3a4f59c728d74a9315fe5fc576cbf825fb; 594e01e3e621357d1bb5a9fe082d7b8530d864b7; f66ef8ec0e6a55c58d3e8165c532190a840e8ad9; 723de867e192c7076e023487fd64d8ef97628ffe; 88241b390f81d84900aa0215447622304b43c579; 3383f5630d5aa0a3d4d524d20b2cc01b2237d0fe; f3fd691d2feecb0b80aba91b01bf880eecd42f7f; aa5eac22e986899598c8eb1ece008a5e667dd3a5,be8a0ffbda6b3dd8c1a1057d530d17003bc58c6c; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; 71a8f2274bed946abffa671da7bd9e4f29c1f3ea; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b7f8a61cc46bab3034bc539e8bcdc20dd2d7c811; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; ea001c2675d61ad96953a70149ac1caa2bf454f3; 0c2a1c466906e682e86c4c3f74aaa92d205faf43; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; adcfa3752be34149ddd5599078306768c1ca7cea; 75715e3689b353e82b9fc7bcdb21acf9d3d04172; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 3fec56c823eaf62632a6501acb003f5ffa0751ec; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; 514de7fd03e14cf5b557b859fddaab2277e45850; da1c8d24e6f37a914f8f8b271fc7c61ae25119fd; 6cd45f7034f5bd148c225a477412bfbe18fee0b6; a7c720587f1d1ce6973e563cda44c8b87a1ca056; f4890345d1f0547606508185cf65d49613fbd423; 256f29267c2317228f6a7b65d698326f0a285e36; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 52fca37f491c76e3daaf53e34741f1d65f91f24a; 6ebc639349d5f02f87685b948b6858641b921e7a; 23a75276d736ceea66987b7b033c2333d1cd80d5; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3,Methods of information in medicine,44 3,"

92dc1e8806700358579fdfd240aea2a3783de38e,Correlation between Human Papillomavirus Status and Quantitative MR Imaging Parameters including Diffusion-Weighted Imaging and Texture Features in Oropharyngeal Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
The incidence of Oropharyngeal Squampus Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) cases is increasing especially in the Western countries due to the spreading of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Radiological investigations, MRI in particular, are used in the daily clinical practice to stage OPSCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of quantitative MR imaging features including diffusion-weighted imaging and human papillomavirus status in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed 59 patients with untreated histologically proved T2-T4 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Human papillomavirus status was determined by viral DNA detection on tissue samples. MR imaging protocol included T2-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (volumetric interpolated brain examination), and DWI sequences. Parametric maps of apparent diffusion coefficient were obtained from DWI sequences. Texture analysis was performed on T2 and volumetric-interpolated brain examination sequences and on ADC maps. Differences in quantitative MR imaging features between tumors positive and negative for human papillomavirus and among subgroups of patients stratified by smoking status were tested using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test; the false discovery rate was controlled using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction; and a predictive model for human papillomavirus status was built using multivariable logistic regression.


RESULTS
Twenty-eight patients had human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, while 31 patients had human papillomavirus-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Tumors positive for human papillomavirus had a significantly lower mean ADC compared with those negative for it (median, 850.87 versus median, 1033.68; P < .001). Texture features had a lower discriminatory power for human papillomavirus status. Skewness on volumetric interpolated brain examination sequences was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients positive for human papillomavirus and smokers (P = .003). A predictive model based on smoking status and mean ADC yielded a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity 92.6% in classifying human papillomavirus status.


CONCLUSIONS
ADC is significantly lower in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma positive for human papillomavirus compared with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma negative for it. ADC and smoking status allowed noninvasive prediction of human papillomavirus status with a good accuracy. These results should be validated and further investigated on larger prospective studies.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Marco Ravanelli"", ids = ""145970586""); list(name = ""Alberto Grammatica"", ids = ""143930378""); list(name = ""E Tononcelli"", ids = ""86937941""); list(name = ""R Morello"", ids = ""134660264""); list(name = ""M Leali"", ids = ""51285913""); list(name = ""S Battocchio"", ids = ""145584906""); list(name = ""G M Agazzi"", ids = ""48276065""); list(name = ""M Buglione di Monale E Bastia"", ids = ""15900788""); list(name = ""R Maroldi"", ids = ""51302940""); list(name = ""P Nicolai"", ids = ""153479411""); list(name = ""D Farina"", ids = ""153370108"")",1a6af2d7aaf5ef12021be7000187f26fc732389c; ac972e799c8a7ec50e9d5594d81aa1715dc7e420; 43b596af768b289b625e86405d7d3727142cb930; 5b32d64a6f0d423207d42e2065e1527965bf64dc,,AJNR.

We introduce a new rule, tail posterior probability, based on the posterior distribution of the standardized difference, to identify genes differentially expressed between two conditions, and we derive a frequentist estimator of the false discovery rate associated with this rule. We compare it to other Bayesian rules in the considered settings. We show how the tail posterior probability can be extended to testing a compound null hypothesis against a class of specific alternatives in multiclass data.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Natalia Bochkina"", ids = ""2801831""); list(name = ""Sylvia Richardson"", ids = ""50130827"")",27ab5e8cb329da2147b4266f603ac9fe70114d31; ae2f35f077b750b7376aae5390cf012d8d5be59c; 06188916e14c7aa0e640f6236ee72921bdf5e386; 25c16a40138b7828d438cde53534896c6e683075; 007f5415bc0a06edf255aa631a6c0680ba5078c6; 210541a4a37a1bbb5c27a372ba40555d646d0bf8; 74a5ad9a40abe865f39b56764d261a08ade246b7; c0c3403caf46772731e8377dfb49088a52054bf3; 72abdf62805ce2cbfcb8e2f9c6d2517de5540efd; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; 75ccccdb14950e873c0b8ce9c9f07a8c23776178; bdfdf6e51b6f7470f10117978c2fc43d4ee60143; c132fe2d73b0c5cbff00242c0c3fbacd3095dca9; b3cf9ec87d31fcd244ea1df0e715e0d17c45d264; 028b4296b2509ebdcf652bebb0c173e515f98b1d; 8319caa04d2135cc1dd415d33d2fda98aca13d41; 79246e6b3ec5079b15c6df36f78eb80bd5f63947; af26e9318390cfc58d98090e2383c5a7710253a6; 298d477c71019a50f543c7e5fee4a22592c6a073,,Biometrics,63 4,"

Molecular characterization of node positive and node negative SLNs through gene expression profiling may improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and identify specific gene signatures for SLN+/SLN- that correlate with clinical outcome. Methods: We characterized 15 SLN+ and 15 SLN- melanoma patients (T3a/b, T4a/b) who underwent SLN dissection for routine staging using transcriptome profiling analysis on 5Î¼ sections of fresh LN samples. The primary endpoint was mRNA expression profiling using the U133A 2.0 Affymetrix gene chips.

The base excision repair (BER) pathway is critical for resolution of abasic sites and damaged bases, estimated to occur 20,000 times in cells daily. DNA polymerase Î² (Pol Î²) participates in BER by filling DNA gaps that result from excision of damaged bases. Approximately 30% of human tumours express Pol Î² variants, many of which have altered fidelity and activity in vitro and when expressed, induce cellular transformation. The prostate tumour variant Ile260Met transforms cells and is a sequence-context-dependent mutator. To test the hypothesis that mutations induced in vivo by Ile260Met lead to cellular transformation, we characterized the genome-wide expression profile of a clone expressing Ile260Met as compared with its non-induced counterpart. Using a 1.5-fold minimum cut-off with a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05, 912 genes exhibit altered expression. Microarray results were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and revealed unique expression profiles in other clones. Gene Ontology (GO) clusters were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify altered gene networks and associated nodes. We determined three nodes of interest that exhibited dysfunctional regulation of downstream gene products without themselves having altered expression. One node, peroxisome proliferator-activated protein Î³ (PPARG), was sequenced and found to contain a coding region mutation in PPARG2 only in transformed cells. Further analysis suggests that this mutation leads to dominant negative activity of PPARG2. PPARG is a transcription factor implicated to have tumour suppressor function. This suggests that the PPARG2 mutant may have played a role in driving cellular transformation. We conclude that PPARG induces cellular transformation by a mutational mechanism.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katherine A.

We leverage a new tribrid instrument with improved fragmentation capacities in a systematic comparison to identify which fragmentation method would be best for the identification of cross-linked peptides. Specifically, we explored three fragmentation methods and two combinations: collision-induced dissociation (CID), beam-type CID (HCD), electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), ETciD, and EThcD. Trypsin-digested, SDA-cross-linked human serum albumin (HSA) served as a test sample, yielding over all methods and in triplicate analysis in total 2602 matched PSMs and 1390 linked residue pairs at 5% false discovery rate, as confirmed by the crystal structure. HCD wins in number of matched peptide-spectrum-matches (958 PSMs) and identified links (446). CID is most complementary, increasing the number of identified links by 13% (58 links). HCD wins together with EThcD in cross-link site calling precision, with approximately 62% of sites having adjacent backbone cleavages that unambiguously locate the link in both peptides, without assuming any cross-linker preference for amino acids. Overall quality of spectra, as judged by sequence coverage of both peptides, is best for EThcD for the majority of peptides. Sequence coverage might be of particular importance for complex samples, for which we propose a data dependent decision tree, else HCD is the method of choice.

724d7568d2b4e67b9c234957f72a69fe40462218,Privacy Preserving Clustering for Distributed Homogeneous Gene Expression Data Sets,"In this paper, the authors present a new approach to perform principal component analysis (PCA)-based gene clustering on genomic data distributed in multiple sites (horizontal partitions) with privacy protection. This approach allows data providers to collaborate together to identify gene profiles from a global viewpoint, and at the same time, protect the sensitive genomic data from possible privacy leaks. The authors developed a framework for privacy preserving PCA-based gene clustering, which includes two types of participants such as data providers and a trusted central site. Within this mechanism, distributed horizontal partitions of genomic data can be globally clustered with privacy preservation. Compared to results from centralized scenarios, the result generated from distributed partitions achieves 100% accuracy by using this approach. An experiment on a real genomic data set is conducted, and result shows that the proposed framework produces exactly the same cluster formation as that from the centralized data set. multiplex technology used in molecular biology. It consists of an arrayed series of thousands of microscopic spots of DNA oligonucleotides, called features, each containing picomoles (10-12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters). This can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that is used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.

Therefore arrays have dramatically accelerated many types of investigation. The microarray data processing pipeline (Hackl, Sanchez Cabo et al., 2004) includes a variety of statistical steps: pre-processing (including background correction, normalization, and summarization), differential analysis which contains raw p-value computation and false discovery rate (FDR) correction, and gene clustering / profiling analysis. Figure 1 shows that microarray experiment process in the lab and Figure 2 illustrates its gene clustering result. However, these exciting advances do come with an inevitable issue, that is, the richer and richer human genomic data contains privacy sensitive information, such as, genetic markers, diseases, etc., which may further lead to an individualâ€™s race, family, or even identity. Unfortunately, because genomic data does not directly carry individual identity information and it used to be believed that the high-throughput data generated from technologies, such as microarray, is not accurate enough, privacy issues in the human genomic data have not been fully considered as a big issue for quite a while in both biomedical and informatics domains, until a very recent work showed that it was very possible to identify the presence of an individual trace contributor within a series of highly complex genomic mixtures (Homer, Szelinger et al., 2008) under some circumstances.

aea0aa6c238b5f9f3933522e39ea7013cb1d6002,Ischemic transient neurological events identified by immune response to cerebral ischemia.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Deciphering whether a transient neurological event (TNE) is of ischemic or nonischemic etiology can be challenging. Ischemia of cerebral tissue elicits an immune response in stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This response, as detected by RNA expressed in immune cells, could potentially distinguish ischemic from nonischemic TNE.


METHODS
Analysis of 208 TIAs, ischemic strokes, controls, and TNE was performed. RNA from blood was processed on microarrays. TIAs (n=26) and ischemic strokes (n=94) were compared with controls (n=44) to identify differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate <0.05, fold change â‰¥1.2). Genes common to TIA and stroke were used predict ischemia in TIA diffusion-weighted imaging-positive/minor stroke (n=17), nonischemic TNE (n=13), and TNE of unclear etiology (n=14).


RESULTS
Seventy-four genes expressed in TIA were common to those in ischemic stroke. Functional pathways common to TIA and stroke related to activation of innate and adaptive immune systems, involving granulocytes and B cells. A prediction model using 26 of the 74 ischemia genes distinguished TIA and stroke subjects from control subjects with 89% sensitivity and specificity. In the validation cohort, 17 of 17 TIA diffusion-weighted imaging-positive/minor strokes were predicted to be ischemic, and 10 of 13 nonischemic TNE were predicted to be nonischemic. In TNE of unclear etiology, 71% were predicted to be ischemic. These subjects had higher ABCD(2) scores.


CONCLUSIONS
A common molecular response to ischemia in TIA and stroke was identified, relating to activation of innate and adaptive immune systems. TNE of ischemic etiology was identified based on gene profiles that may be of clinical use once validated.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Glen C.

Thirty-five weaned pigs were individually housed and randomly assigned to one of five treatments. Pigs were 1) fed a basal diet and intraperitoneally injected with sterile saline (negative control, NC), 2) fed the basal diet and injected with diquat solution (positive control, PC), or fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.3 mg Se/kg as 3) sodium selenite (SS), 4) soybean protein chelated Se (SC) or 5) selenized yeast (SY) and intraperitoneally injected with diquat. Pigs were fed the experimental diets for 17 days and injected with diquat at 10 mg/kg BW or saline on the 11th day of the study (d 0 post-injection (PI)). Diquat exposure induced acute stress and innate immune activation (P < 0.05) at 6 h PI, and compromised (P < 0.05) plasma glutathione peroxidase activity on d 2 PI, which was accompanied by an increase in plasma malondialdehyde at 6 h and d 2 PI (P < 0.10). Organic Se, particularly SY, enhanced (P < 0.05) endogenous antioxidant activity in various aspects compared with PC group. The growth rate and feed intake from d 0 to 7 PI were significantly lower in PC, SS, and SC groups than NC group (P < 0.05).

The authors performed an observational cross-sectional study in two cohorts of surveyed patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Different groups were analyzed based on the drug that each patient was taking, that is, VKAs or NOACs, as well as on the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) versus nonuse of these drugs; they also took into account the potential exposure to other common medications. Descriptive, clinical, and ADR data were reported and analyzed through an adaptation of Bayesian methodology (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05) to detect new signals. Eleven different ADRs in patients on VKAs and statins and 12 in patients on VKAs without statins were found. In evaluating the concomitant therapies, the authors found that analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common therapeutic options, followed by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Seven ADRs were observed in patients concomitantly treated with NOACs and statins, whereas NOACs without concomitant statins were associated with a significantly lower risk of bleeding. The risk of observing an ADR among the patients who are concomitantly treated with VKAs and statins is lower than with analgesics or PPI, while the concomitant use of NOACs and statins is associated with both an increment in the number of observed ADRs and increased risk of bleeding.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""MarÃ­aâ\200\220Isabel JimÃ©nezâ\200\220SerranÃ­a"", ids = ""1417662140""); list(name = ""Carlos TreceÃ±oâ\200\220Lobato"", ids = ""118974093"")",,,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,,
5457f90cd779b4004d47e9173e6f7c010878cb23,Experimental and statistical considerations to avoid false conclusions in proteomics studies using differential in-gel electrophoresis.,"In quantitative proteomics, the false discovery rate (FDR) can be defined as the number of false positives within statistically significant changes in expression. False positives accumulate during the simultaneous testing of expression changes across hundreds or thousands of protein or peptide species when univariate tests such as the Student's t test are used. Currently most researchers rely solely on the estimation of p values and a significance threshold, but this approach may result in false positives because it does not account for the multiple testing effect. For each species, a measure of significance in terms of the FDR can be calculated, producing individual q values. The q value maintains power by allowing the investigator to achieve an acceptable level of true or false positives within the calls of significance. The q value approach relies on the use of the correct statistical test for the experimental design. In this situation, a uniform p value frequency distribution when there are no differences in expression between two samples should be obtained. Here we report a bias in p value distribution in the case of a three-dye DIGE experiment where no changes in expression are occurring. The bias was shown to arise from correlation in the data from the use of a common internal standard. With a two-dye schema, where each sample has its own internal standard, such bias was removed, enabling the application of the q value to two different proteomics studies. In the case of the first study, we demonstrate that 80% of calls of significance by the more traditional method are false positives. In the second, we show that calculating the q value gives the user control over the FDR. These studies demonstrate the power and ease of use of the q value in correcting for multiple testing. This work also highlights the need for robust experimental design that includes the appropriate application of statistical procedures.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Natasha A.

7b9b67d4f2dfceaa64d07f3bcf48beedf745afb8,Causal Gene Network Inference from Genetical Genomics Experiments via Structural Equation Modeling,"The goal of this research is to construct causal gene networks for genetical genomics experiments using expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) mapping and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Unlike Bayesian Networks, this approach is able to construct cyclic networks, while cyclic relationships are expected to be common in gene networks. Reconstruction of gene networks provides important knowledge about the molecular basis of complex human diseases and generally about living systems. In genetical genomics, a segregating population is expression profiled and DNA marker genotyped. An Encompassing Directed Network (EDN) of causal regulatory relationships among genes can be constructed with eQTL mapping and selection of candidate causal regulators. Several eQTL mapping approaches and local structural models were evaluated in their ability to construct an EDN. The edges in an EDN correspond to either direct or indirect causal relationships, and the EDN is likely to contain cycles or feedback loops. We implemented SEM with genetics algorithms to produce sub-models of the EDN containing fewer edges and being well supported by the data. The EDN construction and sparsification methods were tested on a yeast genetical genomics data set, as well as the simulated data. For the simulated networks, the SEM approach has an average detection power of around ninety percent, and an average false discovery rate of around ten percent. iii Acknowledgements I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Ina Hoeschele, for her time, patience, guidance, and encouragement during my doctoral study.

In total, 11,067 putative genomic variations were detected in 125 complete bacterial artificial chromosome sequences corresponding to the region between SW2098 and SW1881, which harbors multiple QTL affecting intramuscular fat content (IMF) and backfat thickness (BFT). Among 173 putative SNP validated by MassArray, 120 SNP were used in an association study on 541 offspring produced by a cross of Korean native pig and Landrace breeds. The significance level of each SNP was determined using single marker regression analysis. Further, significant threshold values were determined using a false discovery rate. Nine out of 120 SNP showed significant effects on BFT or IMF or both. Of the 9 significant SNP, 4 were significantly associated with IMF, 7 were significantly related to BFT, and 2 SNP (Kps8172 and Kps6413) showed significant effects on both traits. Moreover, multiple regression analysis considering all significant SNP was used to correct spurious false positives due to linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, only 1 SNP (Kps6413) was significant for IMF, whereas 4 SNP including Kps6413 showed significant effects on BFT. The significant SNP had generally additive effects and on average explained 1.72% of the genetic variation for IMF and 3.92% for BFT, respectively. These markers can potentially be applied in pig breeding programs for improving IMF and BFT traits after validation in other populations.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kyung-Tai Lee"", ids = ""34668931""); list(name = ""Mi Jeong Byun"", ids = ""38417837""); list(name = ""Kweon Soo Kang"", ids = ""48006859""); list(name = ""Hyunseo Hwang"", ids = ""34587746""); list(name = ""Eung Woo Park"", ids = ""4922560""); list(name = ""Jae Mun Kim"", ids = ""144867843""); list(name = ""T H Kim"", ids = ""8880303""); list(name = ""Seung Hwan Lee"", ids = ""2819945"")",a170aa5e2f0ac57299d73ece10b3a1f64253c8c9; b3aa839c889d64f69e00fe01893ee4f8864b458f; 891bdddcdd294bd9eff35e7f85a3c6e8f285cfa3; 1c164ac15dd343054aeb39dcb0b8e1861ebfbe8f; 81d2832bb44255bcfa72daccb0f8a243ecf6b302,,Journal of animal science,90 4,"

66ffcf5dafdedb0c7ec90298a2129e5f341d58fb,The effect of age and gender on the genetic regulation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D - the FIN-D2D population-based study,"In addition to sunlight and dietary sources, several genes in the metabolic pathway of vitamin D affect serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration. It is not known whether this genetic regulation is influenced by host characteristics. We investigated the effect of age and gender on the genetic regulation of serum 25OHD concentration. In total, 2868 Finnish men and women aged 45-74 years participated in FIN-D2D population-based health survey in 2007. Of the 2822 participants that had serum 25OHD concentration available, 2757 were successfully genotyped. Age and gender-dependent association of SNPs with serum 25OHD concentration was studied in 10 SNPs with previously found association with vitamin D metabolites. Associations of 3 SNPs with serum 25OHD concentration were dependent on age with greater effects on younger (â‰¤60â€¯y) than older (>60â€¯y) adults (rs10783219 in VDR, rs12512631 in GC and rs3794060 in NADSYN1/DHCR7; pinteractionâ€¯=â€¯0.03, 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). The results suggested a novel association between serum 25OHD concentration and rs8082391 in STAT5B gene in men but not in women (pinteractionâ€¯=â€¯0.01). After multiple testing correction with false discovery rate method, two age-dependent interactions (rs3794060 in NADSYN1/DHCR7 gene and rs12512631 in GC gene) remained statistically significant. This is the first study to suggest that genetic regulation of serum 25OHD concentration is age-dependent. Our results also indicated a novel association between serum 25OHD concentration and SNP in STAT5B gene in men.

2212633490f40974540df0249df3b92f265bc1ad,identifies a complete expressed prokaryotic proteome Directed shotgun proteomics guided by saturated RNA-seq Material,"Prokaryotes are, due to their moderate complexity, particularly amenable to the comprehensive identification of the protein repertoire expressed under different conditions. We applied a generic strategy to identify a complete expressed prokaryotic proteome, which is based on the analysis of RNA and proteins extracted from matched samples. Saturated transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq provided an endpoint estimate of the protein-coding genes expressed under two conditions which mimic the interaction of Bartonella henselae with its mammalian host. Directed shotgun proteomics experiments were carried out on four subcellular fractions. By specifically targeting proteins which are short, basic, low abundant and membrane localized, we could eliminate their initial under-representation compared to the estimated endpoint. A total of 1,250 proteins were identified with an estimated false discovery rate below 1%. This represents 85% of all distinct annotated proteins and about 90% of the expressed protein-coding genes. Genes that were detected at the transcript but not protein level, were found to be highly enriched in several genomic islands. Furthermore, genes that lacked an ortholog and a functional annotation were not detected at the protein level; these may represent examples of over-prediction in genome annotations. A dramatic membrane proteome re-organization was observed including differential regulation of autotransporters, adhesins and hemin binding proteins. Particularly noteworthy was the complete membrane proteome coverage, which included expression of all members of the VirB/D4 type IV secretion system, a key virulence factor.

a7d3596bf898100d9f7ee747ad54d0101bce1150,Gene expression signatures and response to imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.,"Despite initial efficacy of imatinib mesylate in most gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients, many experience primary/secondary drug resistance. Therefore, clinical management of GIST may benefit from further molecular characterization of tumors before and after imatinib mesylate treatment. As part of a recent phase II trial of neoadjuvant/adjuvant imatinib mesylate treatment for advanced primary and recurrent operable GISTs (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group S0132), gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays was done on tumor samples obtained before and after imatinib mesylate therapy. Patients were classified according to changes in tumor size after treatment based on computed tomography scan measurements. Gene profiling data were evaluated with Statistical Analysis of Microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes (in pretreatment GIST samples). Based on Statistical Analysis of Microarrays [False Discovery Rate (FDR), 10%], 38 genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in the pretreatment biopsy samples from tumors that significantly responded to 8 to 12 weeks of imatinib mesylate, that is, >25% tumor reduction. Eighteen of these genes encoded KrÃ¼ppel-associated box (KRAB) domain containing zinc finger (ZNF) transcriptional repressors. Importantly, 10 KRAB-ZNF genes mapped to a single locus on chromosome 19p, and a subset predicted likely response to imatinib mesylate-based therapy in a naÃ¯ve panel of GIST. Furthermore, we found that modifying expression of genes within this predictive signature can enhance the sensitivity of GIST cells to imatinib mesylate. Using clinical pretreatment biopsy samples from a prospective neoadjuvant phase II trial, we have identified a gene signature that includes KRAB-ZNF 91 subfamily members that may be both predictive of and functionally associated with likely response to short-term imatinib mesylate treatment.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lori Rink"", ids = ""39435616""); list(name = ""Yuliya Skorobogatko"", ids = ""48003243""); list(name = ""Andrew V.

ce0acc334dbbb02ca265fc2b3ef126bbec3ea8f7,Evaluation of efficacy and safety markers in a phase II study of metastatic colorectal cancer treated with aflibercept in the first-line setting,"Background:Aflibercept (ziv-aflibercept) is an anti-angiogenic agent recently approved in combination with FOLFIRI for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients previously treated with oxaliplatin. Despite heterogeneity in response to aflibercept, no biomarkers for efficacy or adverse effects have been identified. Here we present biomarker data from the randomised phase II AFFIRM trial assessing aflibercept in combination with mFOLFOX6 first line in mCRC.Methods:Ninety-six somatic mutations in key oncogenic drivers of mCRC and 133 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway genes were analysed, and 27 plasma markers measured at baseline, during and after treatment. We assessed correlations of these three classes of biomarkers with progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events (AEs).Results:Somatic mutations identified in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and PIK3R1 did not significantly correlate with PFS (multiple testing-adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) or multiple testing-adjusted FDR>0.3). None of the individual SNPs correlated with PFS (multiple testing-adjusted FDR>0.22), but at the gene level variability in VEGFB significantly correlated with PFS (multiple testing-adjusted FDR=0.0423). Although none of the plasma markers measured at baseline significantly correlated with PFS, high levels of circulating IL8 at baseline together with increased levels of IL8 during treatment were significantly associated with reduced PFS (multiple testing-adjusted FDR=0.0478). No association was found between biomarkers and AEs.Conclusions:This represents the first biomarker study in mCRC treated with aflibercept. High IL8 plasma levels at baseline and subsequent increases in IL8 were associated with worse PFS, suggesting that IL8 may act as a potentially predictive biomarker of aflibercept treatment outcome.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Diether Lambrechts"", ids = ""50385262""); list(name = ""Bernard Thienpont"", ids = ""145782786""); list(name = ""Vincent Thuillier"", ids = ""50819732""); list(name = ""Xavier Sagaert"", ids = ""5281308""); list(name = ""Matthieu Moisse"", ids = ""46632057""); list(name = ""Gilian Peuteman"", ids = ""46731743""); list(name = ""Carles Pericay"", ids = ""49696300""); list(name = ""Gunnar Folprecht"", ids = ""6169634""); list(name = ""John R Zalcberg"", ids = ""5412955""); list(name = ""Chiara Zilocchi"", ids = ""46390777""); list(name = ""Emmanuelle Margherini"", ids = ""7557258""); list(name = ""Marielle Chiron"", ids = ""38629308""); list(name = ""Eric van Cutsem"", ids = ""113946755"")",9ab596ff02dd50fbc40fdd6d0a0bd2a6d34edd10; 0eed5094d59285ff140396820cd4e954cee71adc; 1b7be2f3c0ff2bdedaa306e704b67aa0194e411f; 8fd1d1c1c0dfc04755b3d7696f92d9dd6e7e5537; 7556c0eba222e02cd673e27d488d3d7bf459ccd3; c79fc67aabde6f9fae3832dbdcb4f06218aefa2f; 056f468689716279160a032592d338b319566b38; 3007483bc4fa911b237b1b4b578923dbbe1186fc; f0a6211dabde61ea3645315edbeb3c0b3242545b; 2392fd15368184541bb733e8d97bc294338bfd3c; f3f057dd6589b4baaafd5b1e23188b7152dfb10b; 74c3a210c407cb74a5286621599585eb6725bf59; 5227e6270b5695ecd42809986325ca46d18efc84; ea2770cd5e3adfb0e6e3a4b2f3a75ee2fd4f3113; 6c5043f77c4080cf2df0bfa7dd21e6207928c0f7,03ff73beb7751d17cf8311d81546e25932dc5786; b9f910d2c1d970a47609aa9064ce1882a64160e7; 16528808eab5e8e5f10d717e57a698dc6a3b4324; 71d92bab26967661f51c1e1dfc160993998e7654; e6ebd7f691e176d941dd597cfb3038e1f63e3bae; 13a03b1928765d056a8e73eb4b8c98ae7b9d6b22; 03039375aaa590ce1f569accaa9bb5191b757801; 4ff83f81d0565013309765687e0d891ed6229a8a; 5e0e44c9d6dc9b43a14faaa938d311f841a521cf; 09e7de1bd88978ecbf20cdc1e2bfccf758706166; d9164a8c94c1be8c39813c7f252786a616fb07b2; 5a4e0b7a5adca106bfa19a9551a421b273badf49; 3494293ef08fcf00cb97e7eba32b1765dffbc858; 85d076882f55a5670f68f62b8c1f6acdffb96539; 131fb71bd45a741a70f77ec6e83135ab429a8473; 97fc9d6728f99f7b2e10d97d9bf5fb1e37e14afb; 3bc185f00c9dfda91f533b02afc15caea8240020; a22815e4d6f4cf8caf6a534366f1f04334be0e40; fdbfc0a5e1ac7823ee548257a63677b5b759822e; face6a2c2a35ceab1c421704c94bbf7afead278c; 6ef7f8fc45e36d610f23c1cfb8831d31ac241922; 7dc116fbc57aee8afb3761f58dd7312660446b92; 555bd94f0ef1b8672b60fbd1f88ed0636e5b42dc; c265f309d00929cb59973df662a5f8c15ff7d5cf; b31bc8eb6ab324a8eac11d4282b09b0ad1f0b49d; 843d464e8797e4821a950f01deb06b9e2fe8240c; 8c1704e664916810af7418bb6030ac9f7942b0d4; 2d98d81f7aaf36c98eebd634c232ff7b0e16ad28,British Journal of Cancer,113,1027 - 1034

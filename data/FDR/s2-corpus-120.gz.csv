ed42b1c4918ec8409b1843182cc3e8047b56696d,The Transcriptome and Proteome of the Diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana Reveal a Diverse Phosphorus Stress Response,"Phosphorus (P) is a critical driver of phytoplankton growth and ecosystem function in the ocean. Diatoms are an abundant class of marine phytoplankton that are responsible for significant amounts of primary production. With the control they exert on the oceanic carbon cycle, there have been a number of studies focused on how diatoms respond to limiting macro and micronutrients such as iron and nitrogen. However, diatom physiological responses to P deficiency are poorly understood. Here, we couple deep sequencing of transcript tags and quantitative proteomics to analyze the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown under P-replete and P-deficient conditions. A total of 318 transcripts were differentially regulated with a false discovery rate of <0.05, and a total of 136 proteins were differentially abundant (p<0.05). Significant changes in the abundance of transcripts and proteins were observed and coordinated for multiple biochemical pathways, including glycolysis and translation. Patterns in transcript and protein abundance were also linked to physiological changes in cellular P distributions, and enzyme activities. These data demonstrate that diatom P deficiency results in changes in cellular P allocation through polyphosphate production, increased P transport, a switch to utilization of dissolved organic P through increased production of metalloenzymes, and a remodeling of the cell surface through production of sulfolipids. Together, these findings reveal that T. pseudonana has evolved a sophisticated response to P deficiency involving multiple biochemical strategies that are likely critical to its ability to respond to variations in environmental P availability.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sonya T.

7e6ef62e9dcd6aee85e34ad8431b934d0308b038,Pharmacogenomic Variability of Oral Baclofen Clearance and Clinical Response in Children With Cerebral Palsy.,"BACKGROUND
Pharmacogenomic variability can contribute to differences in pharmacokinetics and clinical responses. Pediatric patients with cerebral palsy with genetic variations have not been studied for these potential differences.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the genetic sources of variation in oral baclofen clearance and clinical responses.


DESIGN
Pharmacogenomic add-on study to determine variability in oral baclofen clearance and clinical responses.


SETTING
Multicenter study based in academic pediatric cerebral palsy clinics.


PARTICIPANTS
A total of 49 patients with cerebral palsy who had participated in an oral baclofen pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study.


METHODS OR INTERVENTIONS
Of 53 participants in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, 49 underwent genetic analysis of 307 key genes and 4535 single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Associations between genotypes and phenotypes of baclofen disposition (weight-corrected and allometrically scaled clearance) and clinical endpoints (improvement from baseline in mean hamstring Modified Tardieu Scale scores from baseline for improvement of R1 spastic catch) were determined by univariate analysis with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS
Primary outcome measures were the genotypic and phenotypic variability of oral baclofen in allometrically scaled clearance and change in the Modified Tardieu Scale angle compared to baseline.


RESULTS
After univariate analysis of the data, the SNP of ABCC9 (rs11046232, heterozygous AT versus the reference TT genotype) was associated with a 2-fold increase in oral baclofen clearance (mean 0.51 Â± standard deviation 0.05 L/h/kg for the AT genotype versus 0.25 Â± 0.07 L/h/kg for the TT genotype, adjusted P < .001). Clinical responses were associated with decreased spasticity by Modified Tardieu Scale in allelic variants with SNPs ABCC12, SLC28A1, and PPARD.


CONCLUSIONS
Genetic variation in ABCC9 affecting oral baclofen clearance highlights the need for continued studies of genetic polymorphisms to better characterize variable drug response in children with cerebral palsy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCC12, SLC28A1, and PPARD were associated with varied responses, which warrants further investigation to determine their effect on spasticity.

529357d205c2008c79e5247945a6daaaccee1d62,Genetic variants in DNA repair genes as potential predictive markers for oxaliplatin chemotherapy in colorectal cancer,"Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy exerts its effects through generating DNA damage. Hence, genetic variants in DNA repair pathways could modulate treatment response. We used a prospective cohort of 623 colorectal cancer patients with stage IIâ€“IV disease treated with adjuvant/palliative chemotherapy to comprehensively investigate 1727 genetic variants in the DNA repair pathways as potential predictive markers for oxaliplatin treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associations with overall survival and recurrence-free survival were assessed using a Cox regression model. Pathway analysis was performed using the gamma method. Patients carrying variant alleles of rs3783819 (MNAT1) and rs1043953 (XPC) experienced a longer overall survival after treatment with oxaliplatin than patients who did not carry the variant allele, while the opposite association was found in patients who were not treated with oxaliplatin (false discovery rate-adjusted P-values for heterogeneity 0.0047 and 0.0237, respectively). The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway was found to be most likely associated with overall survival in patients who received oxaliplatin (P-value=0.002). Our data show that genetic variants in the NER pathway are potentially predictive of treatment response to oxaliplatin.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Elisabeth J.

We focus here on microarray data generated from cancer studies. It is potentially important for the discovery of biomarkers to identify genes whose expression levels correlate with tumor progression. In this article, we develop statistical procedures for the identification of such genes, which we term tumor progression genes. Two methods are considered in this paper. The first is use of a proportional odds procedure, combined with false discovery rate estimation techniques to adjust for the multiple testing problem. The second method is based on order-restricted estimation procedures. The proposed methods are applied to data from a prostate cancer study. In addition, their finite-sample properties are compared using simulated data.",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Debashis Ghosh"", ids = ""145165051""); list(name = ""Arul M.

ac2ce5b8b35e3349dc796f83bc1ca0dd77acf9f4,Identification of new SLE-associated genes with a two-step Bayesian study design,"In our earlier study, we utilized a Bayesian design to probe the association of âˆ¼1000 genes (âˆ¼10â€‰000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on a moderate number of trios of parents and children with SLE. Two genes associated with SLE, with a multitest-corrected false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05, were identified, and a number of noteworthy genes with FDR of <0.8 were also found, pointing out a future direction for the study. In this report, using a large population of controls and adult- or childhood-onset SLE cases, we have extended the earlier investigation to explore the SLE association of 10 of these noteworthy genes (109 SNPs). We have found that seven of these genes exhibit a significant (FDR<0.05) association with SLE, both confirming some genes that have earlier been found to be associated with SLE (PTPN22 and IRF5) and presenting novel findings of genes (KLRG1, interleukin-16, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, toll-like receptor (TLR)8 and CASP10), which have not been reported earlier. The results signify that the two-step candidate pathway design is an efficient way to study the genetic foundations of complex diseases. Furthermore, the novel genes identified in this study point to new directions in both the diagnosis and the eventual treatment of this debilitating disease.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Don L.

c279af64edef4246134b8e8be1dadf8d4bd2da00,In Vivo Comparative Enactment of CarieScanPROâ„¢ with Conventional Methods to Detect Occlusal Carious Lesions in the Mandibular Primary Molars,"Aim
To assess the performance of CarieScanPROâ„¢ with radiovisiography (RVG) and international caries detection and assessment system II (ICDAS-II) to detect the occlusal carious lesions in the mandibular primary molars.


Methods
Fifty healthy children of age 5-7 years were involved and evaluated for caries using visual ICDAS-II, RVG, and CarieScanPROâ„¢. Operative intervention pit and fissure opening served as a gold standard for comparison of the three methods of examination. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) of the methods were calculated at enamel (D1), dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) (D2), and dentine (D3, D4).


Results
At D1 threshold, CarieScanPROâ„¢ showed higher values of sensitivity and accuracy (0.97 and 0.88) and RVG specificity (0.92). At D2 threshold, visual examination showed higher values of sensitivity (0.80) whereas CarieScanPROâ„¢ showed specificity and accuracy of 0.98 and 0.87. At D3, D4 threshold, CarieScanPROâ„¢ showed higher values of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (0.1, 0.98, and 0.99). Higher positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and lower false discovery rate (FDR), false-positive rate (FPR) were shown by CarieScanPROâ„¢. The intraexaminer repeatability for CarieScanPROâ„¢ was good with kappa at D1 (0.77) and D3, D4 (0.98).


Conclusion
CarieScanPROâ„¢ showed higher reproducibility compared to visual examination and RVG for the detection of enamel and dentinal caries. Higher accuracy of CarieScanPROâ„¢ can be used for longitudinal monitoring of occlusal caries in primary teeth with low sensitivity at DEJ.

Methods Proteins were extracted from fresh-frozen tissues from 10 HR and 10 LR UM and from 22 normal choroid samples, subjected to isobaric tagging for relative quantification (iTRAQ) and analysed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Peptide identification was performed using Protein Pilot with a False Discovery Rate set at 5%. Differential expression of proteins and their relative abundance between the groups was investigated by supervised and unsupervised hierarchical clustering and outlier analyses. 
 
Results We identified 2651 unique proteins. Compared to normal choroid, the tumours showed 672 proteins up-regulated more than 1.5-fold and 459 down-regulated more than 1.5-fold. Of these, 18 proteins with known functions in tumour development/progression were identified and shown to be differentially expressed between HR and LR samples. Four of these have been further validated by immunohistochemistry in a larger cohort of patient samples. 
 
Conclusion Using quantitative proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry we have identified novel potential therapeutic targets in UM. One of these in particular is a tumour suppressor associated with chemosensitivity in other cancers, but not yet described in UM. This opens a novel therapeutic avenue that is being further investigated.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Martina Angi"", ids = ""6038914""); list(name = ""Helen Kalirai"", ids = ""4261434""); list(name = ""Be Damato"", ids = ""52543055""); list(name = ""Se Coupland"", ids = ""66993173"")",,,Acta Ophthalmologica,91,0-0

Middle-aged to elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exhibit reduced functional connectivity and brain atrophy underlying cognitive decrements; however, little is known about brain abnormalities in young patients.


OBJECTIVE
To detect brain anatomical and functional changes in young patients with T2DM during the early disease stage.


DESIGN
Case-control study.


SETTING
Tertiary referral hospital.


PARTICIPANTS
Thirty-five young patients with T2DM (<40 years of age) with no detectable microangiopathy and 32 nondiabetic control subjects.


INTERVENTION
None.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Subjects underwent neuropsychological assessments and structural and resting-state functional MRI. Both voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity analyses were performed.


RESULTS
No significant differences in brain volume were observed between the patients with T2DM and the controls after controlling for age, sex, education, and body mass index. Compared with the controls, the patients showed greater connectivity of the left hippocampus with the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, the enhanced functional connectivity of left hippocampus with the left inferior frontal gyrus significantly correlated with disease severity (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio) (r = 0.613, P < 0.001) and executive function (completion time of Stroop Color and Word Test) (r = -0.461, P = 0.005) after false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest an adaptive compensation of brain function to counteract the insidious cognitive decrements during the early stage of T2DM. Additionally, the functional alterations occurring before changes in brain structure and peripheral microangiopathy might serve as early biomarkers related to cognitive decrements.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fang Fang"", ids = ""143816772""); list(name = ""M.

e38ca4fbba3e08245adea273bcd5a00ae3ab58c0,Detection of growth hormone doping by gene expression profiling of peripheral blood.,"CONTEXT
GH abuse is a significant problem in many sports, and there is currently no robust test that allows detection of doping beyond a short window after administration.


OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to evaluate gene expression profiling in peripheral blood leukocytes in-vivo as a test for GH doping in humans.


DESIGN
Seven men and thirteen women were administered GH, 2 mg/d sc for 8 wk. Blood was collected at baseline and at 8 wk. RNA was extracted from the white cell fraction. Microarray analysis was undertaken using Agilent 44K G4112F arrays using a two-color design. Quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan gene expression assays was performed for validation of selected differentially expressed genes.


RESULTS
GH induced an approximately 2-fold increase in circulating IGF-I that was maintained throughout the 8 wk of the study. GH induced significant changes in gene expression with 353 in women and 41 in men detected with a false discovery rate of less than 5%. None of the differentially expressed genes were common between men and women. The maximal changes were a doubling for up-regulated or halving for down-regulated genes, similar in magnitude to the variation between individuals. Quantitative RT-PCR for seven target genes showed good concordance between microarray and quantitative PCR data in women but not in men.


CONCLUSION
Gene expression analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes is unlikely to be a viable approach for the detection of GH doping.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher J.

We aim to emphasize and empirically support the notion that the choice of pairwise versus composite group definitions in DIF is a reflection of how one defines fairness in DIF studies. In this study, a simulation was conducted based on data from a 60-item ACT Mathematics test (ACT; Hanson & BÃ©guin). The unsigned area measure method (Raju) was used as the DIF detection method. An application to operational data was also completed in the study, as well as a comparison of observed Type I error rates and false discovery rates across the two methods of defining groups. Results indicate that the amount of flagged DIF or interpretations about DIF in all conditions were not the same across the two methods, and there may be some benefits to using composite group approaches. The results are discussed in connection to differing definitions of fairness. Recommendations for practice are made.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Halil Ibrahim Sari"", ids = ""46200234""); list(name = ""Anne Corinne Huggins"", ids = ""34975659"")",,,Educational and psychological measurement,75 4,"

cfb0a5d51da41fdb8a6c4c75564a5e637fbd6722,Discussion: On methods controlling the false discovery rate,"I would like to congratulate Sanat Sarkar for an excellent and thorough appraisal of the state of art with the controlling of false discovery rate (FDR), mostly arising in the context of multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) problems. He has indeed focused on all the major statistical aspects of the FDR/MHT complex, elucidating the theoretical and methodological perspectives. There are some genuine statistical challenges embedded in this largely interdisciplinary field of research, and in this discussion I will mostly highlight some of these issues with due emphasis on applications in high-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) data models, and appraise them in the light of the developments in this seminal work.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pranab Kumar Sen"", ids = ""1731053"")",,,Sankhya,70,177-182
c9953af8b92bc66bd7824617f1b8447925025456,Dimension reductio via Sliced Inverse Regression : ideas and extensions,"This thesis proposes three extensions of Sliced Inverse Regression namely: Collaborative SIR, Student SIR and Knockoff SIR.One of the weak points of SIR is the impossibility to check if the Linearity Design Condition (LDC) holds. It is known that if X follows an elliptic distribution thecondition holds true, in case of a mixture of elliptic distributions there are no guaranties that the condition is satisfied globally, but locally holds. Starting from this consideration an extension is proposed. Given the predictor variable X, Collaborative SIR performs initially a clustering. In each cluster, SIR is applied independently. The result from each component collaborates to give the final solution.Our second contribution, Student SIR, comes from the need to robustify SIR. Since SIR is based on the estimation of the covariance, and contains a PCA step, it is indeed sensitive to noise. To extend SIR, an approach based on a inverse formulation of SIR proposed by R.D. Cook has been used.Finally Knockoff SIR is an extension of SIR to perform variable selection and give sparse solution that has its foundations in a recently published paper by R. F. Barber and E. J. Candes that focuses on the false discovery rate in the regression framework. The underlying idea of this paper is to construct copies of the original variables that have some properties. It is shown that SIR is robust to this copies and a strategy is proposed to use this result for variable selection and to generate sparse solutions.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Alessandro Chiancone"", ids = ""3201519"")",,f30ff56fc607ab1ad1f9dcf17afea7915df446e4; f1a6fc476e0e9e6e9002d545558e5bb01e56d2ff; 7784b8981b1384d68f144ccfcee67d9fc4005776; 61e3bce2a834249383c252dfd9811f02ae7c0be2; a01a3748216538d393a63ad3133b926752ec3377; 7cd23baa1488c751b642bda897d07cc7bdb03e91; 0933f064d14373390a2eb5d566ccbf7cd86c08e9; 76b0a46ee00bc34fcc8ebd4b22e1fe672cdd652c; e5235a9a05d720e100e890e73c5781eba2140f76; f01314dd45b125564ff461f040e965214fe20b30; 807f9c4b9ac3d8b3811a54e73d523b1afbafa350; aa0efc63837fa8a34e09a270e9c612c16c6fcfe2; 619584eb07d6ace1d5f28c103b613cbda6948f63; 6b2266474b2b5e9ec59f6395ed78035a7e5a3d4d; 124f69c7d95d733659856eb73519cf3e19b601cf; d5b6706c0f858f26b813c2e1ecbcd8b73ac3e55b; 3428a76ae8e7afec5abc11c9283788a466eb9425; 8d64fc58dc93bafd0e1bb2934494ef8b08a19c98; c78e19ac670155c0cdd1602b9be554420c0ddf08; 88d736d0de8c3cee195b2ee3fb8986cf739faaf4; 706d3d1b24e8be0ac82ee4d60f9975b932eaf934; 1c27e44a5417f82e194832b36166ac152447e33f; ac876b0aaae55037375c5435332fc966b9043883; d45f6311a3812042ff7bba8b4e7b009441c978cf; 9a6eb61af5904075dcc7ea7db1a88079a353b663; f9183ac445a2c005907f6008313a54bdf4eb147d; 3d8caca4b520e6cd7ae0f247bcea92aebe1ff3ba; 591cb58da354853992d89c86cd25dd0f6d9f2e4f; dbf601dac2297e43de5af9e1c6097dd63c3be707; 5f1e6a40cd7634faec1f8e4ac75632422c05e7c2; 2ea43fb2f1bca69a430430a48fd12d7d05272f32; 8cd67dea0fad2592a61b94c68d974def56d36641; 95457d04e4668d8f8f68221931521e80a187a2a3; 2547c6eb52fa906fb8a7ca70b3fa661a2f8b8b28; bd64985810d1dc1acd9882a77bd33a0594e08ca7; 6662aeaebc847128821e2c18379208642ce2b4b4; 9a1b31a848ab2326f10f58ddfb87487e361e3f94; 7e0a394ea3ebe8c0ee570a3943f0343329485a87; 5e9231796bec395110adf35c65dc1ef9ea6ee526; 4d76918f7f0ecb9b1940c716ed80dea2d07ce223; 12985190796aa8c5feab41db8c4d4a71fc5eb3b4; fd302d757fc8d8120103491f987945f7e96842cc; 80b0bcdb3b4bc708450e856a458c1791a2b7e68d; b49a1195d254f8773343aeb1918c7061efc94906; cc04cf9176e7078593d34114ba23e4f73aa2e36f; f1277592f221ea26fa1d2321a38b64c58b33d75b; a26355555da1b19316bfcaa28840f65f3c2ab1d8; 8af18a2a6e46b5a6a6bed604e94f1960d7e0aeec; 5e7c230663449cf7ce126b765b067ba1dcde8cd2; 16e6564b7a9bc380e30d0cd185c9a85dd3c83246; d30f0871a770ecc42bc83695c6d16d5f2b28564b; bffc2219cc3a83d068d1a5305046998d155c2b5b; 2309f7c5dad934f2adc2c5a066eba8fc2d8071ec; b1afe65daa2b814a50a5d71da4bb523f8c6d5b1c; 9a42098359624a4a62da7103a49e3ace2bcd1249; f9b63d2a691e3df496822388dbebcdb3698add96; cac33f91e59f0a137b46176d74cee55c7010c3f8,,,
baf280dde3dd2cfed490465933f003a1ff65bf12,Genome-wide association study between CNVs and milk production traits in Valle del Belice sheep,"Copy number variation (CNV) is a major source of genomic structural variation. The aim of this study was to detect genomic CNV regions (CNVR) in Valle del Belice dairy sheep population and to identify those affecting milk production traits. The GO analysis identified possible candidate genes and pathways related to the selected traits. We identified CNVs in 416 individuals genotyped using the Illumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip array. The CNV association using a correlation-trend test model was examined with the Golden Helix SVS 8.7.0 tool. Significant CNVs were detected when their adjusted p-value was <0.01 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. We identified 7,208 CNVs, which gave 365 CNVRs after aggregating overlapping CNVs. Thirty-one CNVRs were significantly associated with one or more traits included in the analysis. All CNVRs, except those on OAR19, overlapped with quantitative trait loci (QTL), even if they were not directly related to the traits of interest. A total of 222 genes were annotated within the significantly associated CNVRs, most of which played important roles in biological processes related to milk production and health-related traits. Identification of the genes in the CNVRs associated with the studied traits will provide the basis for further investigation of their role in the metabolic pathways related to milk production and health traits.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rosalia Di Gerlando"", ids = ""3982372""); list(name = ""Anna Maria Sutera"", ids = ""25494667""); list(name = ""Salvatore Mastrangelo"", ids = ""40234203""); list(name = ""Marco Tolone"", ids = ""152534454""); list(name = ""Baldassare Portolano"", ids = ""4361649""); list(name = ""Gianluca Sottile"", ids = ""143678055""); list(name = ""Alessandro Bagnato"", ids = ""1878307""); list(name = ""Maria Giuseppina Strillacci"", ids = ""3857502""); list(name = ""Maria Teresa Sardina"", ids = ""47395205"")",fd4b15d018bfa94628954941797606d5d92cecb8,8667eb2d2030efe2a901d4712b9747a449764138; cd3385cef3fc2ad75c389f08ae640ed03f6f8400; 09e0d3dfc4747d6ddd8c62d144680646464a7e15; dc69d4c844812f6e619f0869ccf292b57d981a61; 4de05ee87b3d24fe5466aa627731905901482f4d; 168d873240fd713bf809be687855e718014c757a; 5e5443efcf7601ff8e12f9a3ebd626d25863c966; a093acb653ccf4da229c6f20c410f6e832f0d14a; 218aed10cd9dedecd789d8251f40fa446a4ab629; a4d04d95d9534a659e07ebf1c50a38ffdf5537c7; 7a50123035c17230c684daa437888ab9dafaf1f3; a0acc3939ae03e2fe6ad772a9851525b2510e9c4; d1ce16b74b808146bed9647b991816ca37127d1d; 60bf133b518294454b704c02a5e22d7c861a579c; 4882286db02b79c3d44688e69438da80c249af03; 930d9bc1b96589abeee2b12c8c3f1c7fffc386b7; cd3feaa37dcdd768cc68ec261471a40e18fa3a4c; 8a8f3ec57c6431bfce1ec88a9dc98b3ed4e887be; c358cd12862456625795418c56c91385b8c1bdd0; d4b7d8a38247e86f4ee5abde136e5cbc75051256; 7757ca335a72d8928b0f36e3090698dd0f64d920; 0f5c1c3e56fbaf66b662d48f0342906f35c5eafe; ffea5398dfa704f74d962b56ddbea4fc59382d86; 5b33047f135c83ff184858249444d2bc78473aba; f639a87bc3508b2a2e47092a102901d2f4e38d48; 307df7d446d7e4f0c7c9da65c77821d0114e8f4a; 5abfe8534e5256e3228237942d3a19ae87a631b4; a3a8e0f7364e88e6117ce49515631b5dffde5fc7; 4249e1d658670c2f3253ecf384f31029acbaddeb; 394c721ade04899d24ea26c8909b5431f54cd80f; 1b8ca6db7351bfd66adf27030ad8100c18e0aa55; 921faaba3b4f01bd15de46a7e9e864f35b01238c; af5830eb32720bc09bf619a900af28bccfb7f412; 418162136ba50c16ec5213fab7907aae26563051; 3ce3d592d9139e6ae41a8c06e59d541c997528a0; 6e3557bd0608072dc06be83aba46f3196ff7fc90; 816a4694809cd1e594ed1292cbe3020d2ea60963; 6bf0cd7cdeabedd5093bc4956fabd9be9717eabc; 09189e2d19964fb50e878b8a7d45207c0ab73881; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; cf6ff1a82c1a3c82057c9eab480af2478ef67741; 4a360671aa146cf6ff24417dcbf0f27c90ec6c22; e16a68067cf504872a06e6f099aad8026dd97ce6; 18be05177adfd9c941a1eeb1922b9254de236d9a; 6d78f5d1fb4404d0ae26e2efd58196513e86754c; dcd561a9946f44381a9cfd19ce399e31b3598757; 0cf2d363b943f4ea8bd5227b78592cff63bf88e0; e05b4aa3f18fa5b33d65d836b1faed3035a79dc2; 8c6cff6b3928fe0ca562c03bc811fb3b238e5726; 6911c1955e23ea4f9fbb150c53a8105f325018df,PLoS ONE,14,
04684749fe2b0d17ff67f5e8b7db1db786056c99,Evaluation of voxel-based methods for the statistical analysis of PIB PET amyloid imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease,"Deposition of amyloid plaques is believed to be a central event in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was undertaken to evaluate statistical methods for the assessment of group differences in retention of an amyloid imaging agent, PIB, throughout the brain and to compare these results to FDG studies of glucose metabolism performed in the same subjects on the same day. PET studies were performed in 10 mild to moderate AD and 11 control subjects. Parametric images of PIB retention (over 90 min post-injection) were generated using the Logan graphical analysis with cerebellar (CER, reference region) data as input. FDG parametric images were created by summing the uptake over 40-60 min post-injection and normalizing that to the CER to give a standardized uptake value ratio. Data were compared using parametric (SPM) and non-parametric (SnPM) statistical methods with familywise error (FWE) and false discovery rate (FDR) corrections. PIB results were consistent with previous regional results as AD subjects showed highly significant retention in frontal, parietal, temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices (FDR-corrected p<1.4e-10). FDG results showed regions of marginally significant decreases in uptake in AD subjects (frontal, parietal, temporal, posterior cingulate cortices: FDR-corrected p<0.1) consistent with previous studies. Relative to FDG, the PIB analyses were of greater statistical significance and larger spatial extent. Additionally, the PIB analyses retained significance after both FWE and FDR corrections. These results indicate that voxel-based methods will be useful for future larger longitudinal studies of amyloid deposition that could improve AD diagnosis and anti-amyloid therapy assessment.",2006,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Scott K.

e205a9cf860a45b34941cc0c0e0ac953134606a8,Statistical Significance for Genome-Wide Experiments,"With the increase in genome-wide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genome-wide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where many features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to statistical significance in the analysis of genome-wide data sets, based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true findings and the number of false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q-value is associated with each tested feature in addition to the traditional p-value. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.",2003,,"list(name = ""John M. D.

1c70b2be2346c822fe0b8d8cf3091b609b717eed,A Polymorphism in TLR2 Is Associated With Arterial Thrombosis in a Multiethnic Population of Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"OBJECTIVE
Thrombosis is a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Studies that have investigated the genetics of thrombosis in SLE are limited. We undertook this study to assess the association of previously implicated candidate genes, particularly Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes, with pathogenesis of thrombosis.


METHODS
We genotyped 3,587 SLE patients from 3 multiethnic populations for 77 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes, primarily in TLRs 2, 4, 7, and 9, and we also genotyped 64 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs). We first analyzed association with arterial and venous thrombosis in the combined population via logistic regression, adjusting for top principal components of the AIMs and other covariates. We also subjected an associated SNP, rs893629, to meta-analysis (after stratification by ethnicity and study population) to confirm the association and to test for study population or ethnicity effects.


RESULTS
In the combined analysis, the SNP rs893629 in the KIAA0922/TLR2 region was significantly associated with arterial thrombosis (logistic P = 6.4 Ã— 10(-5) , false discovery rate P = 0.0044). Two additional SNPs in TLR2 were also suggestive: rs1816702 (logistic P = 0.002) and rs4235232 (logistic P = 0.009). In the meta-analysis by study population, the odds ratio (OR) for arterial thrombosis with rs893629 was 2.44 (95% confidence interval 1.58-3.76), without evidence for heterogeneity (P = 0.78). By ethnicity, the effect was most significant among African Americans (OR 2.42, P = 3.5 Ã— 10(-4) ) and European Americans (OR 3.47, P = 0.024).


CONCLUSION
TLR2 gene variation is associated with thrombosis in SLE, particularly among African Americans and European Americans. There was no evidence of association among Hispanics, and results in Asian Americans were limited due to insufficient sample size. These results may help elucidate the pathogenesis of this important clinical manifestation.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rachel Kaiser"", ids = ""34634120""); list(name = ""Ling Fung Paul Tang"", ids = ""40596580""); list(name = ""Kimberly E.

Many variants are associated with multiple traits, even after correction for trait-trait correlation. Discovering subsets of variants associated with a shared subset of phenotypes could help reveal disease mechanisms, suggest new therapeutic options, and increase the power to detect additional variants with similar pattern of associations. Here we introduce two methods based on a Bayesian framework, SNP And Pleiotropic PHenotype Organization (SAPPHO), one modeling independent phenotypes (SAPPHO-I) and the other incorporating a full phenotype covariance structure (SAPPHO-C). These two methods learn patterns of pleiotropy from genotype and phenotype data, using identified associations to discover additional associations with shared patterns. Results The SAPPHO methods, along with other recent approaches for pleiotropic association tests, were assessed using data from the Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) study of 8,000 individuals, whose gold-standard associations were provided by meta-analysis of 40,000 to 100,000 individuals from the CHARGE consortium. Using power to detect gold-standard associations at genome-wide significance (0.05 family-wise error rate) as a metric, SAPPHO performed best. The SAPPHO methods were also uniquely able to select the most significant variants in a parsimonious model, excluding other less likely variants within a linkage disequilibrium block. For meta-analysis, the SAPPHO methods implement summary modes that use sufficient statistics rather than full phenotype and genotype data. Meta-analysis applied to CHARGE detected 16 additional associations to the gold-standard loci, as well as 124 novel loci, at 0.05 false discovery rate. Reasons for the superior performance were explored by performing simulations over a range of scenarios describing different genetic architectures. With SAPPHO we were able to learn genetic structures that were hidden using the traditional univariate tests. Availability https://bitbucket.org/baderlab/fast/wiki/Home.

77239dd360ceea494335fdba39222b98ebb3e12c,Cytotoxic edema at onset in West syndrome of unknown etiology: A longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging study,"OBJECTIVE
To clarify longitudinal changes in white matter microstructures from the onset of disease in patients with West syndrome (WS) of unknown etiology.


METHODS
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was prospectively performed at onset and at 12 and 24 months old in 17 children with WS of unknown etiology. DTI was analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and tract-specific analysis (TSA) of 13 fiber tracts, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were compared with those of 42 age-matched controls. Correlations of FA and MD with developmental quotient (DQ) at age 24 months were analyzed. Multiple comparisons were adjusted for using the false discovery rate (q-value).


RESULTS
TBSS analysis at onset showed higher FA and lower MD in the corpus callosum and brainstem in patients. TSA showed lower MD in bilateral uncinate fasciculi (UF) (right: q < 0.001; left: q = 0.03) at onset in patients. TBSS showed a negative correlation between FA at onset and DQ in the right frontal lobe, whereas FA at 24 months old exhibited a positive correlation with DQ in the diffuse white matter. MD for bilateral UF at 24 months old on TSA correlated positively with DQ (q = 0.04, both).


SIGNIFICANCE
These findings may indicate the existence of cytotoxic edema in the immature white matter and dorsal brainstem at onset, and subsequent alterations in the diffuse white matter in WS of unknown etiology. Microstructural development in the UF might play important roles in cognitive development in WS.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chikako Ogawa"", ids = ""144765371""); list(name = ""Hiroyuki Kidokoro"", ids = ""2342030""); list(name = ""T Fukasawa"", ids = ""143985147""); list(name = ""Hiroyuki Yamamoto"", ids = ""145516609""); list(name = ""Naoko Ishihara"", ids = ""6456872""); list(name = ""Yuji Ito"", ids = ""152776660""); list(name = ""Yoko Sakaguchi"", ids = ""9665629""); list(name = ""Yu Okai"", ids = ""9686907""); list(name = ""Atsuko Ohno"", ids = ""35710025""); list(name = ""Tomohiko Nakata"", ids = ""34681410""); list(name = ""Yoshiteru Azuma"", ids = ""8387943""); list(name = ""Ayako Hattori"", ids = ""34352348""); list(name = ""T Kubota"", ids = ""145358933""); list(name = ""T Tsuji"", ids = ""48021258""); list(name = ""Akihiro Hirakawa"", ids = ""1881460""); list(name = ""Hisashi Kawai"", ids = ""1805595""); list(name = ""Jun Natsume"", ids = ""3973946"")",,e70cd224d1a3d8012b21b8e12566ae77ef1377b4; 08cd98e1477673af69eefe0614a94bb8cd77efab; 786c2090d94f1386aeff11237623cb1c3582b2e3; 7985dc801bf519bf6b916c299b6c9e680083d1c6; b3bd6b03c35ae77b5f0378b14338d14eeddee7cc; cf5f88b683e97268f37184f8e7e6e8e629ff6f35; e757cd756a972c2a23d3a19cc9bf5395c84dc6b4; d8a699bd911d0784fba61932f54578e9f5c3819c; 0db03c1c9b3fd3ec7fb77e211503e5ef33953a60; 397cf87a66d845399bc01d7ab4f26bd248384380; 96a885fc2e795bb1903437f4426c48b42beb331f; fef23c056bf8271ca0ab7f54834031b17302bed9; a3863bae5ae692e4488eb1f6514396e75179cec8; 97ed350cbdcc521395a17417dedb520737cce081; e57fd9ec88364ac68c8ca5ee6c4c348e905d79e3; f052fe997aed03a303a21247a84f975f5649b04a; c41c24332dc0ab968a5e138e1016dd3fb0618bd8; 89753d0fefbe4122bff859bb333184ad7cbaeccb; 9ae9f9c02fc4947daa6d59425d1c9d39e9c1d527; fc8d4d0057b7f5daca0825d39601097a2b54d7b1; 8c5ceb7b527d21f695458fab195a03dcd535d26a; 9974c0139790cce82a4e7c35ad325c7669e767ee; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c8d2da6b52c2b1085db7255a9270f6839858f298; 3078962ee24766530f78b6abbaf759b76d364950; 41f121793394234295dc5dd20cf871275952d1d4; f7dea6317b0c377467280620f826d7031705e82d; e6f8adf7acf452be11361e8501d1d5d8fc5883b7; 5defce353e2de35892e40cea785cca2db0d229a7; ab872d2c1882b302cb20cbd0293d0b14b610f272; 4a32bfba90309d75aa67f1b0b9656eaa389b94fe; 6e60f8015d96f71dd7945827160dd89212d8c77e; 5da7b5c79193b285542751b30c750a5d9461295b; 027d5820fe40ad304a86b34c0f6573d7d736f8eb; 906e0bcc9c0c89cf7975595e7ae4236c07d80160; 29de1cbb4a54ffa798e9093d5ac4c94a3f1084f5,Epilepsia,59,440â€“448
9b0b27d0c6f0609196706bc42d322ab5f48fe9cd,Association of Age at Onset and Longitudinal Course of Prefrontal Function in Youth With Schizophrenia,"Importance The extent of cognitive deterioration after schizophrenia (SZ) onset is poorly understood because prior longitudinal studies used small samples of older individuals with established illness. Objective To examine the association of age at onset and subsequent longitudinal course of prefrontal activity during the first 2 years of illness in youths with SZ and healthy control participants (HCs). Design, Setting, and Participants This naturalistic, longitudinal, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study included patients with recent-onset SZ and HCs aged 12 to 25 years enrolled in an ongoing study of cognition in recent-onset psychosis in the Sacramento, California, area from October 13, 2004, through June 25, 2013. Participants completed clinical assessments and an established measure of cognitive control, the AX Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT), during fMRI at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up. Whole-brain, voxelwise, and an a priori dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of interest analyses were performed. Group differences in developmental trajectories were examined by focusing on behavioral performance (dâ€²-context) and cognitive control-associated brain activity. The association of antipsychotic medication and clinical factors were also examined. Data were analyzed from April 15, 2015, through August 29, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes included group differences (HC vs SZ) in behavioral performance (d'-context from AX-CPT) and brain activity for cue B-A trials of the AX-CPT in an a priori DLPFC region of interest at baseline and across the age span. Secondary analysis examined the influence of antipsychotics on behavioral performance and DLPFC activity. Results Among the sample of 180 participants (66.1% male; mean [SD] age at baseline, 19.2 [3.2] years), 87 patients with SZ (mean [SD] age, 19.6 [3.0] years) showed impaired performance compared with 93 HCs (mean [SD] age, 18.8 [3.4] years) across the age span (estimated difference [SE], âˆ’0.571 [0.12], dâ€²-context; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Patients with SZ showed reduced activation in the DLPFC and parietal cortex (false discovery rate cluster corrected to Pâ€‰<â€‰.05) compared with HCs under conditions of high cognitive control at baseline. Region-of-interest analysis showed reduced activation in the DLPFC bilaterally for patients with SZ, with a trajectory that paralleled that of HCs across the age span (left DLPFC &bgr; [SE] estimates, 0.409 [0.165] for the HC group and âˆ’0.285 [0.130] for the SZ group [main effect of group, Pâ€‰=â€‰.03]; right DLPFC &bgr; [SE] estimates, 0.350 [0.103] for the HC group and âˆ’0.469 [0.157] for the SZ group [Pâ€‰=â€‰.003]). Antipsychotic medication, clinical symptoms, and global functioning were associated with SZ performance. Conclusions and Relevance During the initial 1 to 2 years after illness onset, young individuals with SZ showed deficits in DLPFC activation and cognitive control, with developmental trajectories comparable to those of HCs. Younger age at onset was not associated with reduced cognition or activation. For individuals contributing to longitudinal analysis, results suggest that young patients do not show deterioration or disruption of ongoing brain development in the initial years after illness onset.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tara A Niendam"", ids = ""6754935""); list(name = ""Kimberly L.

9396018b554543c73d2e24046c13ce0991e1f380,Model-free feature screening for categorical outcomes: Nonlinear effect detection and false discovery rate control,"Feature screening has become a real prerequisite for the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, as it is effective in reducing dimensionality and removing redundant features. However, existing methods for feature screening have been mostly relying on the assumptions of linear effects and independence (or weak dependence) between features, which might be inappropriate in real practice. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting continuous features for a categorical outcome from high-dimensional data. We propose a powerful statistical procedure that consists of two steps, a nonparametric significance test based on edge count and a multiple testing procedure with dependence adjustment for false discovery rate control. The new method presents two novelties. First, the edge-count test directly targets distributional difference between groups, therefore it is sensitive to nonlinear effects. Second, we relax the independence assumption and adapt Efron's procedure to adjust for the dependence between features. The performance of the proposed procedure, in terms of statistical power and false discovery rate, is illustrated by simulated data.

5fb70cc7ebe7c62fcf29775d788de09d5720df50,The estimation and inference of complex models,"In this thesis, we investigate the estimation problem and inference problem for the complex models. Two major categories of complex models are emphasized by us, one is generalized linear models, the other is time series models. For the generalized linear models, we consider one fundamental problem about sure screening for interaction terms in ultra-high dimensional feature space; for time series models, an important model assumption about Markov property is considered by us. The first part of this thesis illustrates the significant interaction pursuit problem for ultra-high dimensional models with two-way interaction effects. We propose a simple sure screening procedure (SSI) to detect significant interactions between the explanatory variables and the response variable in the high or ultra-high dimensional generalized linear regression models. Sure screening method is a simple, but powerful tool for the first step of feature selection or variable selection for ultra-high dimensional data. We investigate the sure screening properties of the proposal method from theoretical insight. Furthermore, we indicate that our proposed method can control the false discovery rate at a reasonable size, so the regularized variable selection methods can be easily applied to get more accurate feature selection in the following model selection procedures. Moreover, from the viewpoint of computational efficiency, we suggest a much more efficient algorithm-discretized SSI (DSSI) to realize our proposed sure screening method in practice. And we also investigate the properties of these two algorithms SSI and DSSI in simulation studies and apply them to some real data analyses for illustration. For the second part, our concern is the testing of the Markov property in time series processes. Markovian assumption plays an extremely important role in time series analysis and is also a fundamental assumption in economic and financial models. However, few existing research mainly focused on how to test the Markov properties for the time series processes. Therefore, for the Markovian assumption, we propose a new test procedure to check if the time series with beta-mixing possesses the Markov property. Our test is based on the Conditional Distance Covariance (CDCov). We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed method.

520d88e9288b10c9dcc7d1de321918ed43917358,Maternal Obesity Affects Fetal Neurodevelopmental and Metabolic Gene Expression: A Pilot Study,"OBJECTIVE
One in three pregnant women in the United States is obese. Their offspring are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental and metabolic morbidity. Underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We performed a global gene expression analysis of mid-trimester amniotic fluid cell-free fetal RNA in obese versus lean pregnant women.


METHODS
This prospective pilot study included eight obese (BMIâ‰¥30) and eight lean (BMI<25) women undergoing clinically indicated mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis. Subjects were matched for gestational age and fetal sex. Fetuses with abnormal karyotype or structural anomalies were excluded. Cell-free fetal RNA was extracted from amniotic fluid and hybridized to whole genome expression arrays. Genes significantly differentially regulated in 8/8 obese-lean pairs were identified using paired t-tests with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (false discovery rate of <0.05). Biological interpretation was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the BioGPS gene expression atlas.


RESULTS
In fetuses of obese pregnant women, 205 genes were significantly differentially regulated. Apolipoprotein D, a gene highly expressed in the central nervous system and integral to lipid regulation, was the most up-regulated gene (9-fold). Apoptotic cell death was significantly down-regulated, particularly within nervous system pathways involving the cerebral cortex. Activation of the transcriptional regulators estrogen receptor, FOS, and STAT3 was predicted in fetuses of obese women, suggesting a pro-estrogenic, pro-inflammatory milieu.


CONCLUSION
Maternal obesity affects fetal neurodevelopmental and metabolic gene expression as early as the second trimester. These findings may have implications for postnatal neurodevelopmental and metabolic abnormalities described in the offspring of obese women.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrea G.

7054fa6703f1a0adcb4e506069fd21c3f3453d8d,Genetic architecture and regulatory impact on hepatic microRNA expression linked to immune and metabolic traits,"Regulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression contributes to a wide range of target gene expression and phenotypes. The miRNA expression in the liver, the central metabolic organ, was examined in 209 pigs, and integrated with haematological and clinical biomarkers of metabolic and overall health, mRNA-target expression levels and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes. The expression levels of 426 miRNA species correlated with plasma haematological or biochemical traits (rÂ² = |0.19â€“0.45|, false discovery rate < 5%). Pairs of these miRNAs and their predicted target mRNAs showing expressing levels associated with the identical traits were examined to understand how immune and metabolic traits are affected by miRNA-mediated regulatory networks derived by mapping miRNA abundance as an expression quantitative trait. In total, 221 miRNA-expression-QTL correspond to 164 SNPs and 108 miRNAs, including miR-34a, miR-30e, miR-148-3p, miR-204, miR-181-5p, miR-143-5p and let-7 g that also correlate with the biomarkers. Sixty-one SNPs were simultaneously associated with 29 miRNA and 41 mRNA species. The expression levels of 13 out of 29 miRNA were correlated with one of the biochemical or haematological traits. For example, the expression levels of miR-34a were correlated with serum phosphorus and cholesterin levels; miR-204, miR-15a and miR-16b were correlated with triglyceride. For haematological traits, the expression levels of miR-652 and miR-204 were correlated with the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, and the expression of miR-143 was correlated with plateletcrit. Pleiotropic association analyses revealed genetic links between mRNA and miRNA on SSC6 for miR-34a, SSC9 for miR-708 and SSC14 for miR-652. Our analysis of miRNA and mRNA transcript profiles, their correlation with clinically important plasma parameters of hepatic functions as well as information on their genetic regulation provide novel regulatory networks and potential new biomarkers for immune and metabolic traits.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Siriluck Ponsuksili"", ids = ""2893450""); list(name = ""Nares Trakooljul"", ids = ""5752711""); list(name = ""Frieder Hadlich"", ids = ""2287990""); list(name = ""Fiete Haack"", ids = ""46617572""); list(name = ""Eduard MurÃ¡ni"", ids = ""2408919""); list(name = ""Klaus Wimmers"", ids = ""145275397"")",323314342135ed86a6315ebf9c090eb72ec7d2a7,b99b6b51be3d7b9fa885412399b68ea6afc1e124; feabd288c67c23c7dec5a4c1446d236588a09e36; fa6cc30dd070bd1196a639e5a72bdba5e6e32dd2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4abebdc4e957336ae3369c3c487e821221d84663; 27ea8047bcd724e8217bd0c8c32e31a0d5a2c7df; 1b1f2d98c834c3aa33ae17e353816e825e35abf0; 63445015162b7ab3094233dd736b01b467a780c3; e6ca0983ebf3762f719566b1bbf0d8e82073e270; 5e26d44b41adb2d4be677b214f414f99141f1ae2; f716c6b95c834033fa9584202bb9e5505cee4a2f; 89bc99c67ca16e84ee9b0071290d36ddc17eb2a1; 40a9081edbbae010cabfca15ffb940a2d1bc0567; 6e13389118e5f144e5f7beb71f870eca63a392d9; c1707968545bd2a092e4f6f8d1cf03c21f98e23d; d92c40ddf2c4349eb0bcaf7babc793d3c8a4f176; 2a2e5cfffe3c6b569e3b3311b699b482e96fe0c6; fb5e5719e99fd700542120534e37e90f2efd1bd3; 85987acda2d414175350e7fe7947136464942aef; e6df612888132b3cde774fd01344132fc931c53b; b0e8333497be0e0af1fdc9d13e197ebafa5efbb7; a6dae1226368bcc54cbe9039d25a023995e3eafa; 1fbcc4706be25728f7a88aeaecd854a3a7c1c380; d9dd44896f92463c2f35115c6c1cecbe4c07f3b9; 6a97855c529f5bbcc57883ba6ae7686fa383d54e; fefbe09965e9066764487fc9d590463b79b34a7f; 3be85704e4a8f45c6e5d0822833f7fc56ffe7c4e; 853c70b57a37151067935c724181951611a1b35b; 829ec49e070d17f1328d31aec0663ba36dfa8587; 397eea0c43e18361adecc71e8622868723fd9141; 4d40d4c5ae4defbeb82807c3158af61c840b9473; dc1251b718e0d8f34b91f2ff2dc555a5cf026089; bf7defd7918575b38a6dffa77f71d09ac4270cab; 4b47e7bf6848e3954631612e95145381b56ab749; 765f7e9e3754de0a980ed416ecbec15ac0563d9a; 838600a02922261011ef407ebac63b057ea09d8a; 00d1c01beb0a33046492f162a13347e5685aa678; 1b371b43f5fbc1d10df0acd9518e379c0fd2adf8; 4defd36e5c03393ab77e602d5fda8831d74e712c; 443b938f7e82b71dac5b4e7b4fa49bf55aa81d35; 9f45b17347d26b91fcaadb5b357f023cc8f7803c; 342571cc106bd739a277bb3ca30600421b05e561; 4d6b4121e31d762ac6e3357fdf5a126ffd61b597; 9c9683e3b8b1be4b5b682f05b50fd140cb72b910; 180b81038e9963cc6180fa9972c105a2ee8088c2; b088e0beee73075d4ebcc35469df4b67b70e51f5; 7b21852650a8fc323664964107b5502ef323c79c; 24dbcdb2a83749b6d323aef7b2bea770b2372399; b01974fd8c6c8ffc92fe1e4b8eb27806cdc6181f; 10617b92d0b9c4a1fbe517a125f6db59027f7ffa; b3d28d56b17ac66ae43655741319c8ee31d589e7; bb3488c1317e6d86f3f732ad8452d86d8c3510fc; 6baedaf73466dc65615a11f5ed663a4084e8dfe8; 923a0ab5888be54815c45eba0e7e51f8a1f8226c; 29b6d94e5618608fe893a632d5588f28494229e7; 9bbc2001902e8eb0f5739ddd7b780813f480cffa; 31c7c9b56289e40423f2090a18ff0fafc2e8634e; b723ec55c81d030ca8ba0bbec86513400f6e2566; b47d535a4fcfeae8537030ae02a01d9cc77b0766,Open Biology,7,
cbb43fccc282f80043b495fd901a1382042b4513,"Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, offspring cord blood DNA methylation, and offspring cardiometabolic health in early childhood: an epigenome-wide association study.","Pre-pregnancy obesity is an established risk factor for adverse sex-specific cardiometabolic health in offspring. Epigenetic alterations, such as in DNA methylation (DNAm), are a hypothesized link; however, sex-specific epigenomic targets remain unclear. Leveraging data from the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) cohort, linear regression models were used to identify CpG sites in cord blood leukocytes associated with pre-pregnancy obesity in 187 mother-female and 173 mother-male offsprings. DNAm in cord blood was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450k BeadChip. Replication analysis was conducted among the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Associations between pre-pregnancy obesity-associated CpG sites and offspring BMI z-score (BMIz) and blood pressure (BP) percentiles at 4-5-years of age were also examined. Maternal pre-pregnacy obesity was associated with 876 CpGs in female and 293 CpGs in male offspring (false discovery rate <5%). Among female offspring, 57 CpG sites, including the top 18, mapped to the TAPBP gene (range of effect estimates: -0.83% decrease to 4.02% increase in methylation). CpG methylation differences in the TAPBP gene were also observed among males (range of effect estimates: -0.30% decrease to 2.59% increase in methylation). While technically validated, none of the TAPBP CpG sites were replicated in ALSPAC. In NEST, methylation differences at CpG sites of the TAPBP gene were associated with BMI z-score (cg23922433 and cg17621507) and systolic BP percentile (cg06230948) in female and systolic (cg06230948) and diastolic (cg03780271) BP percentile in male offspring. Together, these findings suggest sex-specific effects, which, if causal, may explain observed sex-specific effects of maternal obesity.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chantel L Martin"", ids = ""6814873""); list(name = ""Dereje Jima"", ids = ""48960692""); list(name = ""Gemma C Sharp"", ids = ""47157267""); list(name = ""Lauren E.

19fd2ac170b5d95cbedfb4e0ef22001578d5d199,Chronic exposure to ambient particulate matter alters cardiac gene expression patterns and markers of oxidative stress in rats,"Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) significantly increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population. We hypothesized that some components of PM can affect the gene expression patterns in the hearts of rats exposed for 3Â months to filtered air (FA), coarse (CP; 2.5â€‰<â€‰dpâ€‰<â€‰10Â Î¼m), fine (FP; dpâ€‰â‰¤â€‰2.5Â Î¼m) or ultrafine (UFP; dpâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.18Â Î¼m) components of PM. The median diameters of CP, FP, and UFP were 3Â Î¼m, 0.7Â Î¼m and 0.07Â Î¼m, respectively. Exposures (nâ€‰=â€‰8 per group) were performed using a particle concentrator system in Riverside, California, an area with high ambient levels of photochemically derived gaseous and particulate pollutants. At the end of the exposure, hearts were subjected to gene expression profiling by using Illumina RatRef-12 bead chips and levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), a biomarker of oxidative stress, were measured. Applying fold ratio >1.5 (for both up- and down-regulated genes), we found three genes in the CP and nine genes in the UFP groups with significantly changed expression, compared with FA. No significant changes in gene expression patterns were observed in the FP group. In the UFP group thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), a negative regulator of an antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin, and cytochrome P450 (Cyp2e1), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of foreign substances demonstrated significant up-regulation (fold ratios 1.79 and 1.57, respectively, with false discovery rate, FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In the CP group there was also a trend towards increased Txnip expression (fold ratio 1.43, FDRâ€‰>â€‰0.05) and significant increase in the Cyp2e1 expression (fold ratio 1.79, FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Changes in the Txnip and Cyp2e1 expression showed statistically significant positive correlation to each other (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0009) and were confirmed by real-time PCR. In addition Txnip and Cyp2e1 expression demonstrated statistically significant moderate correlation with the levels of MDA in the heart. Up-regulation of both Cyp2e1 and Txnip are observed in hearts of patients with certain cardiac diseases. Therefore, chronic exposure to CP and UFP directly affects expression of disease-relevant genes in the myocardium.",2011,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Boris Z.

We present Float, a wrist-to-finger input approach that enables one-handed and touch-free target selection on smartwatches with high efficiency and precision using only commercially-available built-in sensors. With Float, a user tilts the wrist to point and performs an in-air finger tap to click. To realize Float, we first explore the appropriate motion space for wrist tilt and determine the clicking action (finger tap) through a user-elicitation study. We combine the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal with accelerometer and gyroscope to detect finger taps with a recall of 97.9% and a false discovery rate of 0.4%. Experiments show that using just one hand, Float allows users to acquire targets with size ranging from 2mm to 10mm in less than 2s to 1s, meanwhile achieve much higher accuracy than direct touch in both stationary (>98.9%) and walking (>71.5%) contexts.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ke Sun"", ids = ""143819051""); list(name = ""Yuntao Wang"", ids = ""47904824""); list(name = ""Chun Yu"", ids = ""1772504""); list(name = ""Yukang Yan"", ids = ""10765566""); list(name = ""Hongyi Wen"", ids = ""3396051""); list(name = ""Yuanchun Shi"", ids = ""1732440"")",98da8f8a43bbe1fc803839f334c8abf972280805; 288ddb5e7431177aefab265095e3c0866b7a9a75; 95c9dd5e6023274026a0b171c7d767d94562fe04; 8f16802877c720f741ba5ee4a8f86a4c78235189; 30c1b0282fed9502943633297b03073eaf6bd4da; cf8c65b32ebe3c2da2fce0496fd3e904f83b3278; 50b2e5adc0af45f9e22711267899383dc781c367; 047a1e091962e2c10363b76a7342fae5dfd6554e; 8b48b0d4941466cd926ce8b6c01b68970a3db517; 0d1cd0819a0a682f47e8192565c7abb9344aebec; 885820fc3c3a2d2d89824dde28965b264e87d35b; 39e5c635482cc1bbd506baafb029ce2c91ef8f5d; dd43ab453b94eda86de20127688756731addae3d; 354a22265b3bf594417920dc0b17be8cdae36bd6; f6004b301293ac9547aad5297086990593dbd018; 09f0c0ec7e19ed5dc1daa09ba8cb87f7bded962a; e0650b982d4eed358a13187e793b129c50b8759d; f9c6ee59c809843e7fddbf8a7527f8084d03efe9,00ecb601af43c8228ccc18189e3e26a6f76b2e9b; 8332d7dfa45120e880acf81694204ece421e8270; 2b828f1a15d2fdaabd51d79a96e7fb3f4b80da85; c75564763219ca8ecd115113c0b1841c2030d7d0; 3c76b9192e0828c87ce8d2b8aaee197d9700dd68; 9980833ff58e5666043f3abd03bf7d8434aab7a0; 1920b5a97667a8ce7761c2bb05f2526d258ad599; 90ea0b781917fee1baa6112259cf3773a8e0fccc; f4735176fb0f94c9be5117b0ce8f6bd22add320b; 8d176197c2a8eec704ec07ddee4b69449357c385; 870f78efed36c437d173444b82cf76970e257056; df25e5667030c42e81fc58ce72bfe2b77e84bb8a; b49a9a9aef24e71dba65685daf0d6779ab53b741; a170695031183d03108dd812ea40a8286c845a5c; 321ded7aa3f06756b7ce7915802410c1d05a3a84; 1ef468981638378a55886bf1977124b352faa059; 52543e6946e2fb56d146fc6f1b29b1257d9c3db0; f95e4cd46abcae28cf5dec4df71e442d02a8c6ae; 4243aaf971ec65e9907cb39f999fb134d0e27462; 8bc01f02f74e42009fcadb833635ab9702f71ec6; bcfc9302922b36577e7e24296aca3542ed40352c; bad2ba84d9f6feb07b35e7855cff6e44c3c0172e; 51b53cd4bf77dc6ad841bd159d2a20cf28fbf021; 6adc7c33566402e7aec97e9b7039ba4921fcf8d4; 65f729d4ad1890b9cbb134ff761f88addb364407; 93107e0b5d64324ba71ecb1fdbc298a1c421368e; a3deb8bdf784c82601b1a5e109cbe73e0b4c8d42; 862c45aa76decc5b2a293b295f47c1ef2992f007; b54ffad792d6d1f22f15cd36cc9201138599c245; 2813a1f4282170a3fa77097f34a18e0207e2c4e7; 3f2f89237f0db8f81cb6318d93f6499f85530ee4; 598923bd28da8caaf2cb3074bce4c790a10310fa; a468ba81dc678731109a45677ab5a609f4da8998; 5918390563721ccad323d7bf5a774ca88fa3e36f; 3817e95ecabeb742ede1bcdb94df518b84c829a8; 1cd75efeb2077add138505028a7c7329191df9e1; 1759d71eb237e3e8318f4743ebecf63c18a76042; c1c949fcbec434c9a5113faa2ede30f746bcf11e; 74d8efb12458a733280ecc0464d89124cfd23ec8; a13ff458d5e7461eaccec0bee2e856b93c6be172; 083b14387fbf202706d2009fb385ce1c0e6c19ee; 62b5da314184bcb37b5f79ae682dd7dbf656d3f5; 4646ada5b373db4385c4a90cba595ff7cc17ccea; bb2639217c44a3c94976502d9282530aa6614f89; 624a251e6f53e872534a16dcd96b11315c25d165; f4e138b39605b1c7d9aae9e8726b2802f884b4c1; 06058f8d5f2a9f17e7e03a7e624c4f7b8998d319,Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,
1465d3cc8a9fb982dfe0adea96c8dea609f42421,"Biomarker discovery in non-small cell lung cancer: integrating gene expression profiling, meta-analysis, and tissue microarray validation.","PURPOSE
Global gene expression profiling has been widely used in lung cancer research to identify clinically relevant molecular subtypes as well as to predict prognosis and therapy response. So far, the value of these multigene signatures in clinical practice is unclear, and the biologic importance of individual genes is difficult to assess, as the published signatures virtually do not overlap.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Here, we describe a novel single institute cohort, including 196 non-small lung cancers (NSCLC) with clinical information and long-term follow-up. Gene expression array data were used as a training set to screen for single genes with prognostic impact. The top 450 probe sets identified using a univariate Cox regression model (significance level P < 0.01) were tested in a meta-analysis including five publicly available independent lung cancer cohorts (n = 860).


RESULTS
The meta-analysis revealed 14 genes that were significantly associated with survival (P < 0.001) with a false discovery rate <1%. The prognostic impact of one of these genes, the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), was confirmed by use of immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 2 independent NSCLC cohorts, altogether including 617 NSCLC samples. Low CADM1 protein expression was significantly associated with shorter survival, with particular influence in the adenocarcinoma patient subgroup.


CONCLUSIONS
Using a novel NSCLC cohort together with a meta-analysis validation approach, we have identified a set of single genes with independent prognostic impact. One of these genes, CADM1, was further established as an immunohistochemical marker with a potential application in clinical diagnostics.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Johan Botling"", ids = ""2125266""); list(name = ""Karolina Edlund"", ids = ""2483844""); list(name = ""Miriam Lohr"", ids = ""40270394""); list(name = ""Birte Hellwig"", ids = ""33605431""); list(name = ""Lars H Holmberg"", ids = ""4481970""); list(name = ""Mats Lambe"", ids = ""2199031""); list(name = ""Anders Berglund"", ids = ""48294137""); list(name = ""Simon Ekman"", ids = ""4289232""); list(name = ""Michael Bergqvist"", ids = ""5036741""); list(name = ""Frederik PontÃ©n"", ids = ""143810507""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© KÃ¶nig"", ids = ""36104822""); list(name = ""Oswaldo Fernandes"", ids = ""10207449""); list(name = ""Mats T.

1bdad148e76307af9f4a5d918a963137f419a335,Effect of interoception on intra- and inter-network connectivity of human brain â€” An independent component analysis of fMRI data,"Most stimuli in the viscera do not reach conscious perception, although they may activate some cortical structures. However, recent evidences suggest that various forms of subliminal interoceptive inputs may influence brain function. In this study, we used spatial independent component analysis (ICA) as a multivariate method to investigate the effect of interoception on the intra- and inter-network connectivity of the human brain. 15 healthy participants were scanned during the resting-state and a visceral stimulation task. Following a recently suggested ICA framework, we applied a high model order ICA of 75 to the fMRI data, and identified 34 components as non-artifactual intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Results demonstrate significant intra-network connectivity difference within the salience network (SN) and the default mode network (p <; 0.05, family-wise error corrected). Significant inter-network connectivity differences were also found for several ICN pairs, most notably between the SN and the frontoparietal central executive network, and between the SN and the limbic association network (p<;0.05, false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons). Taken together, these observations suggest significant effect of interoception on the network connectivity architecture of the human brain especially involving the SN when compared to the resting-state baseline.",2015,Psychology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Behnaz Jarrahi"", ids = ""2581057""); list(name = ""Dante Mantini"", ids = ""2702784""); list(name = ""Spyros Sreejanth Kollias"", ids = ""145389579"")",a03889ae32e07efc69235467512bf2474c1d5371; 57a2aa7df873c06b69e3054ccbdb5a5c9972839d; f4c5ef4c0b35ce3c49c27a1a3ffa659acb3ebc15; 94568c698349b0237b9656d80d2e6bfac1bb5dd3; a631875c15ec0203467658538c3568cd87d0c83d,66cedab15c294a206785ffc8e797dca66813c906; a9054e09b981bccbe4f58366abe9606b6f33f26e; c2cae15f8335f2c4d28c78a6e145e1665a70e0b7; 7876d48ba506b013fa8eea0b7f7e74b0e4994cc8; 16e1d74262355b27cc21026e65c89468de7d60f6; c3e26b9bfec3a313f48f1815e991934ebe53fab0; ae2f6e9c5d0d45a3d182a6c8fe2bc0f238214d7b; 4365538803e3f8cd0d7ae3bab12acf75e7b4d113; 92aef030a898c6302c9d729d63f9854063eb9b72; 7ef16f997257c30bd5a36b1dec6a3329afd35c4f; 7e21226e1a42301eb91fe3fc609decfe7903365e; d80be263bae316c49ccf51899a7f923fecd28657,2015 7th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER),,320-323
542c7c0da167147f7454369023b7d15080ce4fa7,Dosimetry and Gastrointestinal Toxicity Relationships in a Phase II Trial of Pelvic Lymph Node Radiotherapy in Advanced Localised Prostate Cancer,"AIMS
Pelvic lymph node (PLN) radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer is limited by late gastrointestinal toxicity. Application of rectal and bowel constraints may reduce risks of side-effects. We evaluated associations between intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) dose-volume data and long-term gastrointestinal toxicity.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from a single-centre dose-escalation trial of PLN-IMRT were analysed, including conventionally fractionated (CFRT) and hypofractionated (HFRT) radiotherapy schedules. Associations between volumes of rectum and bowel receiving specified doses and clinician- and patient-reported toxicity outcomes were investigated independently. A metric, Î´ median (Î´M), was defined as the difference in the medians of a volume between groups with and without toxicity at a specified dose and was used to test for statistically significant differences.


RESULTS
Constraints were respected in most patients and, when exceeded, led to higher rates of gastrointestinal toxicity. Biologically relevant associations between rectum dose-points and toxicity were more numerous with both mild and moderate toxicity thresholds, but statistical significance was limited after correction for false discovery rate. Rectal V50Gy (CFRT) associated with grade 2+ bleeding; bowel V43Gy and V47 (HFRT/4 days/week schedule) associated with patient-reported loose stools and diarrhoea, respectively. Further investigation showed that CFRT patients with rectal bleeding had a mean rectal V50Gy above the treatment planning constraint.


CONCLUSIONS
When dose-volume parameters are kept below tight constraints, toxicity is low. Residual dosimetry loses much of its predictive power for gastrointestinal toxicity in the setting of PLN-IMRT for prostate cancer. We have benchmarked dose-volume constraints for safely delivering PLN-IMRT using CFRT or HFRT.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Miguel Luiz Ribeiro Ferreira"", ids = ""66479712""); list(name = ""Karen Thomas"", ids = ""144380230""); list(name = ""Lesley Truelove"", ids = ""47928689""); list(name = ""Asgharullah Khan"", ids = ""145046253""); list(name = ""Christopher C.

13374aa9f3fe1db1f50a8dad836f31074825e4b5,Association between skeletal musce metabolomics profile and cardiorespiratory fitness in young men,"High cardiorespiratory fitness levels (CRF) are strongly associated with reduction of risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. CRF can be assessed by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2MAX) or maximal power output (MPO). Skeletal muscle is the main organ responsible for peripheral adaptations related to CRF improvement. In this sense, metabolomics has been pointing out as a potential tool to identify muscular metabolic signature in response to exercise and different phenotypes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate metabolites in human skeletal muscle associated with CRF. Participated in this study 70 sedentary young men (18-30 years old). Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected at fasting state (12 h). After 72 h, CRF was assessed by MPO, obtained during a maximal incremental test performed until voluntary exhaustion in cycle ergometer, followed by re-test 48 h later. Skeletal muscle samples were analysed through metabolomics (H1 NMR spectroscopy). Associations of baseline metabolites with MPO were explored via three analytical strategies: (1) correlations with gains in MPO; (2) significant difference between groups of and Low CRF and High CRF; and (3) metabolite contribution to significant pathways related to MPO. The significance level was P < 0.01 or false discovery rate of 0.1. From 70 identified metabolites, only Formate and NADP+ were supported by the three levels of evidence. Intrinsic CRF levels are associated with higher baseline metabolities.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucas de Marchi Silva"", ids = ""73775963""); list(name = ""Mara Patricia Tarina Chacon Mikahil"", ids = ""98217137""); list(name = ""Alex Castro"", ids = ""145361486""); list(name = ""Renata Garbellini Duft"", ids = ""13302915""); list(name = ""Marina LÃ­via Venturini Ferreira"", ids = ""46972798""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© LuÃ­s Lugnani de Andrade"", ids = ""35830808""); list(name = ""ClÃ¡udia Regina Cavaglieri"", ids = ""3932306"")",,,,,
4d474f1488523844aa1a9821a0f16462ad487b85,A clash of cultures in discussions of the P value,"To the Editor: In their exchange of letters, van Helden1 and Halsey et al.2 debate the utility of the P value and of the confidence interval (CI) for interpreting experiments. In addition to the specific points raised, their exchange illustrates a clash of cultures that may be illuminating for readers to note. Namely, there are two broad mindsets: The craftsmanâ€”a single P value is reported as an end result of the analysis of a predefined single question, as is the case for, say, a clinical trial or a small-scale biological experiment. The industrialistâ€”P values are used to summarize a screen of many hypotheses, as in gene expression analysis, genome-wide association studies and other types of high-throughput biology. Typically, such analyses involve iterative data exploration, and the â€˜resultâ€™ is only an intermediate step, to be followed by more analysis. Importantly, the distribution of all the other P values gives a lot of contextual information for each particular P value. A clash can arise between the craftsmen (exemplified by the arguments of Halsey and colleagues) and the industrialists (exemplified by van Helden). For instance, the claim made by Halsey et al.2 that â€œthe problem with running the test many times is that this virtually never happens in practiceâ€ is true for the craftsman but blatantly wrong for large-scale testing. The figure presented by van Helden1 (including volcano plots and P value histograms) shows that he is thinking large. How does this affect the alleged fickleness of the P value? A single P value can be fickle. In particular, if the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no effect) or if the analysis is underpowered, the P value can lie anywhere between 0 and 1 with equal probability, and therefore it will be irreproducible. However, the distribution of many P values, industrially produced, is very reproducible, by virtue of the law of large numbers. In fact, in large-scale testing, P values are easier to deal with than CIs. Multiple testing is naturally and intuitively reasoned about in terms of P values, whereas this is roundabout with CIs. The contextual information of all P values can be modeled using Bayesian concepts, such as local false discovery rates and empirical nulls3. Moderated tests4 can avoid some of the fickleness, and these approaches have been hugely successful. Common to both sidesâ€™ arguments is the observation that the P value alone is an insufficient summary of an inferential process. To usefully report the results of a statistical analysis, scientists should provide not only P values but also the underlying data and the complete analysis workflow, using a reporting tool such as Jupyter or Rmarkdown.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wolfgang Huber"", ids = ""153415792"")",237d290553e5f6a58fab29fbfeb040bb6a02c4ae; fddc0dbd9107d43009734087750b6e26b77e636f,,Nature Methods,13,607-607
287708e2a8b65578efcb682b2a7c0f5e9b60f2a5,Effect of Diet Supplementation on the Expression of Bovine Genes Associated with Fatty Acid Synthesis and Metabolism,"Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are of important nutritional and health benefit to human. Food products of animal origin are their major dietary source and their concentration increases with high concentrate diets fed to animals. To examine the effects of diet supplementation on the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, 28 Angus steers were fed either pasture only, pasture with soybean hulls and corn oil, pasture with corn grain, or high concentrate diet. At slaughter, samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue were collected, from which RNA was extracted. Relative abundance of gene expression was measured using Affymetrix GeneChip Bovine Genome array. An ANOVA model nested within gene was used to analyze the background adjusted, normalized average difference of probe-level intensities. To control experiment wise error, a false discovery rate of 0.01 was imposed on all contrasts. Expression of several genes involved in the synthesis of enzymes related to fatty acid metabolism and lipogenesis such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty acid synthetase (FASN), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty-acyl elongase (LCE) along with several trancription factors and co-activators involved in lipogenesis were found to be differentially expressed. Confirmatory RT-qPCR was done to validate the microarray results, which showed satisfactory correspondence between the two platforms. Results show that changes in diet by increasing dietary energy intake by supplementing high concentrate diet have effects on the transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in fat metabolism which in turn has effects on fatty acid content in the carcass tissue as well as carcass quality. Corn supplementation either as oil or grain appeared to significantly alter the expression of genes directly associated with fatty acid synthesis.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sandeep J.

52cd6ea38c4ea3da1f80b2b191c2f446bab29563,"New Glycoproteomics Software, GlycoPep Evaluator, Generates Decoy Glycopeptides de Novo and Enables Accurate False Discovery Rate Analysis for Small Data Sets","Glycoproteins are biologically significant large molecules that participate in numerous cellular activities. In order to obtain site-specific protein glycosylation information, intact glycopeptides, with the glycan attached to the peptide sequence, are characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods such as collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). While several emerging automated tools are developed, no consensus is present in the field about the best way to determine the reliability of the tools and/or provide the false discovery rate (FDR). A common approach to calculate FDRs for glycopeptide analysis, adopted from the target-decoy strategy in proteomics, employs a decoy database that is created based on the target protein sequence database. Nonetheless, this approach is not optimal in measuring the confidence of N-linked glycopeptide matches, because the glycopeptide data set is considerably smaller compared to that of peptides, and the requirement of a consensus sequence for N-glycosylation further limits the number of possible decoy glycopeptides tested in a database search. To address the need to accurately determine FDRs for automated glycopeptide assignments, we developed GlycoPep Evaluator (GPE), a tool that helps to measure FDRs in identifying glycopeptides without using a decoy database. GPE generates decoy glycopeptides de novo for every target glycopeptide, in a 1:20 target-to-decoy ratio. The decoys, along with target glycopeptides, are scored against the ETD data, from which FDRs can be calculated accurately based on the number of decoy matches and the ratio of the number of targets to decoys, for small data sets. GPE is freely accessible for download and can work with any search engine that interprets ETD data of N-linked glycopeptides.

Several algorithms exist for inferring regulatory relationships between genes. One of the state of the art algorithms is Trigger, but Trigger seems to produce unsatisfactorily high probability estimates in some cases. In this thesis we analyze several issues of Trigger which are related to the estimation of the local false discovery rate, which Trigger uses to calculate its probability estimates. We show that even though Trigger is able to identify regulation relationships, the issues lead to an overestimation of the probabilities for regulation relationships. We will also demonstrate that a new approach using Bayes factors for correlation matrices can be applied to this problem and does not suffer from these issues. We apply the new algorithm, which we call BFCM, to an experiment in yeast in order to show that it is able to produce rich and biologically coherent information about the underlying gene regulatory relationships. The new algorithm produces more conservative probability estimates than Trigger, and is able to identify new regulation relationships.",2016,,,,ff3d338f13daf9c9fb692fc081a1e553df1ccfa3; b0b92b393fa58f005fc78264ff0988b925a28b3e; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 176048a963d4c7dbdd86c9ee6942c29342087533; 64af617824b16a3424f9674e3950c288d997ff21; 19c21c6d297e524358a1809bfb53fc458763c293; 7d94dcb2b0e9d112a6c15223404f1b9fc08cb892; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; 37c2f613658f6d53742e46b3fc5b8cd802c334c1; a03106ea6708bfb9d4159565ab88837b42cebc5d; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 7fd4f8e9167677ce2e062d36dd912df345427bd5; 81b701cffbe068270e50481a4c97a2d584c9ad52; e88ff432d63f5d0a11916e5dc5048a5fc0951587; 1ae155fbd0c4614d9f9dd9b3b57ac4d3aad7bdc6; de12c047f37aa395a49671dcb34a0e8aa86e8056; dbf6cdca0565bb6cf342cc75b996dfc82c2c5b39; 89fd039d2016248328cb40ec9229bec5fd1deaa5; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; de28c165623adabcdba0fdb18b65eba685aaf31d; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 89578eac44d57985592207a4cb34a519fc01b7f6; 9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; ac203ae0ce018db326e9d932a19a6a172e5dbf3f; d5ed576effa823c176c54c935cdb97496095c32a; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b,,,
846fa884539a5e56b370693a24f6da25bbc069af,Genome-wide association and pathway-based analysis using latent variables related to milk protein composition and cheesemaking traits in dairy cattle.,"The aim of this study was to perform genome-wide associations (GWAS) and gene-set enrichment analyses with protein composition and cheesemaking-related latent variables (factors; F) in a cohort of 1,011 Italian Brown Swiss cows. Factor analysis was applied to identify latent structures of 26 phenotypes related to bovine milk quantity and quality, protein fractions [Î±S1-, Î±S2-, Î²-, and Îº-casein (CN), Î²-lactoglobulin, and Î±-lactalbumin (Î±-LA)], coagulation and curd firming at time t (CFt) measures, and cheese properties [cheese yield (%CY) and nutrients recovery in the curd] of individual cows. Ten orthogonal F were extracted, explaining 74% of the original variability. Factor 1%CY underlined the %CY characteristics, F2CFt was related to the CFt process parameters, F3Yield was considered as descriptor of milk and solids yield, whereas F4Cheese N underscored the presence of nitrogenous compounds (N) into the cheese. Four more F were related to the milk caseins (F5Î±S1-Î²-CN, F7Î²-Îº-CN, F8Î±S2-CN, and F9Î±S1-CN-Ph) and 1 F was linked to the whey protein (F10Î±-LA); 1 F underlined the udder health status (F6Udder health). All cows were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead Chip v.2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Single marker regression GWAS were fitted. Gene-set enrichment analysis was run on GWAS results, using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway databases, to reveal ontologies or pathways associated with the F. All F but F3Yield showed significance in GWAS. Signals in 10 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) were detected. High peaks on BTA6 (âˆ¼87 Mbp) were found for F6Î²-Îº-CN, F5Î±S1-Î²-CN, and at the tail of BTA11 (âˆ¼104 Mbp) for F4Cheese N. Gene-set enrichment analyses showed significant results (false discovery rate at 5%) for F8Î±S2-CN, F1%CY, F4Cheese N, and F10Î±-LA. For F8Î±S2-CN, 33 Gene Ontology terms and 3 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes categories were enriched, including terms related to ion transport and homeostasis, neuron function or part, and GnRH signaling pathway. Our results support the feasibility of factor analysis as a dimension reduction technique in genomic studies and evidenced a potential key role of Î±S2-CN in milk quality and composition.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christos Dadousis"", ids = ""4133338""); list(name = ""Sara Pegolo"", ids = ""4073868""); list(name = ""Guilherme J.

In the present study, we evaluate the epigenome-wide association of arsenic exposure in utero and DNA methylation in placenta (n = 37), umbilical artery (n = 45) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (n = 52) in a birth cohort using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Unadjusted and cell mixture adjusted associations for each tissue were examined along with enrichment analyses relative to CpG island location and omnibus permutation tests of association among biological pathways. One CpG in artery (cg26587014) and 4 CpGs in placenta (cg12825509; cg20554753; cg23439277; cg21055948) reached a Bonferroni adjusted level of significance. Several CpGs were differentially methylated in artery and placenta when controlling the false discovery rate (q-value<0.05), but none in HUVEC. Enrichment of hypomethylated CpG islands was observed for artery while hypermethylation of open sea regions were present in placenta relative to prenatal arsenic exposure. The melanogenesis pathway was differentially methylated in artery (Max F P < 0.001), placenta (Max F P < 0.001), and HUVEC (Max F P = 0.02). Similarly, the insulin-signaling pathway was differentially methylated in artery (Max F P = 0.02), placenta (Max F P = 0.02), and HUVEC (Max F P = 0.02). Our results show that prenatal arsenic exposure can alter DNA methylation in artery and placenta but not in HUVEC. Further studies are needed to determine if these alterations in DNA methylation mediate the effect of prenatal arsenic exposure and health outcomes later in life.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andres Cardenas"", ids = ""143997795""); list(name = ""E.

f9d97d69c874bc4d40bccbc018575e80d707bd70,Management trends for anaplastic meningioma with adjuvant radiotherapy and predictors of long-term survival.,"OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study was to describe effects of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for anaplastic meningiomas (AMs) on long-term survival, and to analyze patient and RT characteristics associated with long-term survival.METHODSThe authors queried a retrospective cohort of patients with AM from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 to describe treatment trends. For outcome analysis, patients with at least 10 years of follow-up were included, and they were stratified based on adjuvant RT status and propensity matched to controls for covariates. Survival curves were compared. A data-driven approach was used to find a biologically effective dose (BED) of RT with the largest difference between survival curves. Factors associated with long-term survival were quantified.RESULTSThe authors identified 2170 cases of AM in the NCDB between 2004 and 2015. They observed increased use of adjuvant RT in patients treated with higher doses. A total of 178 cases met the inclusion criteria for outcome analysis. Forty-five percent (n = 80) received adjuvant RT. Patients received a BED of 80.23 Â± 16.6 Gy (mean Â± IQR). The median survival time was not significantly different (32.8 months for adjuvant RT vs 38.5 months for no RT; p = 0.57, log-rank test). Dichotomizing the patients at a BED of 81 Gy showed maximal difference in survival distribution with a decrease in median survival in favor of no adjuvant RT (31.2 months for adjuvant RT vs 49.7 months for no RT; p = 0.03, log-rank test), but this difference was not significant after false discovery rate correction. Age was a significant predictor for long-term survival.CONCLUSIONSAMs are aggressive tumors that carry a poor prognosis. Conventional adjuvant RT improves local control. However, the effect of adjuvant radiation on overall survival is unclear. Further investigation into this area is warranted.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ahmad Alhourani"", ids = ""136782680""); list(name = ""Zaid Aljuboori"", ids = ""139200855""); list(name = ""Mehran B Yusuf"", ids = ""38304444""); list(name = ""Shiao Y.

ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9,On false discovery rate thresholding for classification under sparsity,"We study the properties of false discovery rate (FDR) thresholding, viewed as a classification procedure. The ''0''-class (null) is assumed to have a known density while the ''1''-class (alternative) is obtained from the ''0''-class either by translation or by scaling. Furthermore, the ''1''-class is assumed to have a small number of elements w.r.t. the ''0''-class (sparsity). We focus on densities of the Subbotin family, including Gaussian and Laplace models. Nonasymptotic oracle inequalities are derived for the excess risk of FDR thresholding. These inequalities lead to explicit rates of convergence of the excess risk to zero, as the number m of items to be classified tends to infinity and in a regime where the power of the Bayes rule is away from 0 and 1. Moreover, these theoretical investigations suggest an explicit choice for the target level $\alpha_m$ of FDR thresholding, as a function of m. Our oracle inequalities show theoretically that the resulting FDR thresholding adapts to the unknown sparsity regime contained in the data. This property is illustrated with numerical experiments.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pierre Neuvial"", ids = ""2225429""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456"")",37f41ef7707f4b091de3e12b19f48e60cb015a50; 2a3cd075bd4c0c88117d5d217a8115a7f32cbddd; a368058872ade3e559d3bbb93bb91211b60d0fd2; c0ded50844287041acc3c4801ac5c31b292d899a; 451c2b09f99f7f99046863e8df49627776838e54; c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef; b0397532153c0978f75bd542b73db0349db8ad1c; 19b0c1c501abcf09e396602da00217964b407afc; 72de53cb739e8a284ab5d243b8aad56aecfa7ec4; 42f2bada52176d60194d81bbd6f3fbc58496e652; 2f2c79c6e2c6cd513c1f8047129ef0d54c0539fb; 0e40441cebb03fa4df6fad43ef5ff592e34c479b; b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 1900e254a8923892e0bdd6a0315bb845ceb6bc3e; 7d75552a4b5743e487074bf8c519e048a5d32029; e99ce4cab6c0ab24623944ae0889f6e91b9c6f4d,1775719a073b2f510ba5454a69f04aa6051fbff0; c174f3cd783f6d7c60f45465a11531dad3ec0ceb; d612d7c21d4130a457968273d79c2c2f6946953d; 81278cfbdb82aca89fb04cd952640c444996c68c; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 9c41fe875e10e6ef08b610a5fbc2587783b6dab8; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 0cd6a57304e89656611273d9d58d918b52e9c81e; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; d60607f4c936a83d3823d1dd3b575370ff7fbe3c; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 234cff6937c43cb1c4d3510faeda6c8720737f9d; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; ea46d5e259e75d4822789b02689b8df70ef9329f; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 6d3fb1482ea20a3d75d39c0147977e775c1af173,Annals of Statistics,40,2572-2600
7d3d0c33f4a47f446dfb36549b66a5f8501f15f6,Genome-wide association study of panic disorder in the Japanese population,"Panic disorder (PD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Although a number of association studies have been conducted, no gene has been identified as a susceptibility locus. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study of PD in 200 Japanese patients and the same number of controls, using the GeneChip Human Mapping 500â€‰K Array Set. Genotypes were determined using the Bayesian Robust Linear Model with Mahalanobis (BRLMM) genotype calling algorithm. The genotype data were data-cleaned using criteria for SNP call rate (â©¾95%), Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium (Pâ©¾0.1%) and minor allele frequency (â©¾5%).

1f6573c21841f212d058906db426369460662948,Microarray-based gene expression profiling in patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes defines a disease-related signature and IL-1-responsive transcripts.,"OBJECTIVE
To analyse gene expression patterns and to define a specific gene expression signature in patients with the severe end of the spectrum of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). The molecular consequences of interleukin 1 inhibition were examined by comparing gene expression patterns in 16 CAPS patients before and after treatment with anakinra.


METHODS
We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 CAPS patients with active disease and from 14 healthy children. Transcripts that passed stringent filtering criteria (p valuesâ‰¤false discovery rate 1%) were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEG). A set of DEG was validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and functional studies with primary cells from CAPS patients and healthy controls. We used 17 CAPS and 66 non-CAPS patient samples to create a set of gene expression models that differentiates CAPS patients from controls and from patients with other autoinflammatory conditions.


RESULTS
Many DEG include transcripts related to the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, oxidative stress, cell death, cell adhesion and motility. A set of gene expression-based models comprising the CAPS-specific gene expression signature correctly classified all 17 samples from an independent dataset. This classifier also correctly identified 15 of 16 post-anakinra CAPS samples despite the fact that these CAPS patients were in clinical remission.


CONCLUSIONS
We identified a gene expression signature that clearly distinguished CAPS patients from controls. A number of DEG were in common with other systemic inflammatory diseases such as systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The CAPS-specific gene expression classifiers also suggest incomplete suppression of inflammation at low doses of anakinra.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""James E.

4edd9ec6f05a3cb0a73247bbc20c4c93ab7d14bd,New tool for proteomic analysis,"As proteins are the molecular machinery of the cell, proteomics is a natural choice to characterize biochemical processes. The preferred analytical method for proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS) because of its sensitivity and ability to characterize unknown molecules. Since intact proteins are difficult to examine via MS, most studies digest proteins into peptides. However, digests of tissue extracts are complex, containing hundreds of thousands of peptides. A mass spectrometer cannot process all of these peptides simultaneously, so digests are usually separated using liquid chromatography (LC) prior to analysis. As no two LC runs are the same, matching peptides from different runs is challenging and lining up all of the data in large cohort studies is extremely difficult. Additional problems with LC-MS include drift in the instrumentâ€™s sensitivity and chemical noise that can complicate measurement of peptides. In a new report, the laboratory of Jun Qu, a professor in Pharmaceutical Science from the University at Buffalo, present a software package, IonStar, that addresses these difficulties with proteomic analysis. To begin, the team benchmarked IonStar with a control sample and compared it to other analysis packages. Their software quantified more proteins and had the least missing data of all the programs while also having the lowest false discovery rate. Finally, IonStar had the best precision and accuracy. Next, investigators applied the software to a real dataset that looked at traumatic brain injury (TBI). Each year millions of people suffer TBIâ€”classified as mild, moderate, or severeâ€”and the search for therapeutic drugs is a priority at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Another professor from the University at Buffalo, David Poulsen, had characterized two drugs, methamphetamine (METH) and phenoxybenzamine (PBZ), that reduced damage following TBI in rats as assayed through cognitive and behavioral tests. The experiment consisted of 5 groups of 10 rats subjected to mild TBI, extreme TBI, extreme TBI with PBZ treatment 8 hours post injury, extreme TBI with METH treatment 8 hours post injury, and sham animals. At 32 hours, the researchers collected tissues from hippocampus and cortex. Upon analysis, they quantified 7200 proteins, with only 0.2% of the proteins having missing values. Proteomic results resembled neurobehavioral work in that the two drug treatments made severe TBI animals resemble mild TBI. Future plans for IonStar include improving identification of unassigned peptides to increase protein coverage.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Clark Nelson"", ids = ""143779980"")",,,Lab Animal,47,211
43a37d20a16482c9249f34c25c0e354dd845adce,Assessing Significance in High-Throughput Experiments by Sequential Goodness of Fit and q-Value Estimation,"We developed a new multiple hypothesis testing adjustment called SGoF+ implemented as a sequential goodness of fit metatest which is a modification of a previous algorithm, SGoF, taking advantage of the information of the distribution of p-values in order to fix the rejection region. The new method uses a discriminant rule based on the maximum distance between the uniform distribution of p-values and the observed one, to set the null for a binomial test. This new approach shows a better power/pFDR ratio than SGoF. In fact SGoF+ automatically sets the threshold leading to the maximum power and the minimum false non-discovery rate inside the SGoF' family of algorithms. Additionally, we suggest combining the information provided by SGoF+ with the estimate of the FDR that has been committed when rejecting a given set of nulls. We study different positive false discovery rate, pFDR, estimation methods to combine q-value estimates jointly with the information provided by the SGoF+ method.

b0c4071812ba1cf3afa1af780d732cf789f5e7cb,Capillary Zone Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass Spectrometry with Activated Ion Electron Transfer Dissociation for Large-scale Top-down Proteomics,"AbstractCapillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been recognized as an efficient approach for top-down proteomics recently for its high-capacity separation and highly sensitive detection of proteoforms. However, the commonly used collision-based dissociation methods often cannot provide extensive fragmentation of proteoforms for thorough characterization. Activated ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD), that combines infrared photoactivation concurrent with ETD, has shown better performance for proteoform fragmentation than higher energy-collisional dissociation (HCD) and standard ETD. Here, we present the first application of CZE-AI-ETD on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer for large-scale top-down proteomics of Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. CZE-AI-ETD outperformed CZE-ETD regarding proteoform and protein identifications (IDs). CZE-AI-ETD reached comparable proteoform and protein IDs with CZE-HCD. CZE-AI-ETD tended to generate better expectation values (E values) of proteoforms than CZE-HCD and CZE-ETD, indicating a higher quality of MS/MS spectra from AI-ETD respecting the number of sequence-informative fragment ions generated. CZE-AI-ETD showed great reproducibility regarding the proteoform and protein IDs with relative standard deviations less than 4% and 2% (nâ€‰=â€‰3). Coupling size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to CZE-AI-ETD identified 3028 proteoforms and 387 proteins from E. coli cells with 1% spectrum level and 5% proteoform-level false discovery rates. The data represents the largest top-down proteomics dataset using the AI-ETD method so far. Single-shot CZE-AI-ETD of one SEC fraction identified 957 proteoforms and 253 proteins. N-terminal truncations, signal peptide cleavage, N-terminal methionine removal, and various post-translational modifications including protein N-terminal acetylation, methylation, S-thiolation, disulfide bonds, and lysine succinylation were detected.

We show that existing meta-analysis methods are not appropriate for this problem, and suggest novel methods instead. We prove that our multiple testing procedures control for appropriate error rates. The suggested family-wise error rate controlling procedure is valid for arbitrary dependence among the test statistics within each study. A more powerful procedure is suggested for false discovery rate (FDR) control. We prove that this procedure controls the FDR if the test statistics are independent within the primary study, and independent or have positive dependence in the follow-up study. For arbitrary dependence within the primary study, and either arbitrary dependence or positive dependence in the follow-up study, simple conservative modifications of the procedure control the FDR. We demonstrate the usefulness of these procedures via simulations and real data examples. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""M.

60e48f4059114bb288f523ce97bd4e487fb6a6cb,Quantitative neuroproteomics of an in vivo rodent model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury reveals a temporal regulation of novel pathophysiological molecular markers.,"Cerebral ischemia or stroke, an acute neurological injury lacking an effective therapy, is the second leading cause of death globally. The unmet need in stroke research is to identify viable targets and to understand their interplay during the temporal evolution of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here we report a temporal signature of the ischemic hemisphere revealed by the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based 2D-LC-MS/MS strategy in an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of focal cerebral I/R injury. To recapitulate clinical stroke, two hours of MCAO was followed by 0, 4, and 24 h of reperfusion to capture ischemia with an acute and subacute durations of reperfusion injury. The subsequent iTRAQ experiment identified 2242 proteins from the ischemic hemisphere with <1.0% false discovery rate. Data mining revealed that (1) about 2.7% of detected proteins were temporally perturbed having an involvement in the energy metabolism (Pygb, Atp5b), glutamate excitotoxicity (Slc1a3, Glud1), neuro-inflammation (Tf, C3, Alb), and cerebral plasticity (Gfap, Vim, Gap43); (2) astrocytes participated actively in the neurometabolic coupling underlining the importance of a cerebro-protective rather than a neuro-protective approach; and (3) hyper-acute yet progressive opening of the blood brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by stimulation of an innate immune response and late activation of a regenerative response, which provides an extended therapeutic window for intervention. Several regulated proteins (Caskin1, Shank3, Kpnb1, Uchl1, Mtap6, Epb4.1l1, Apba1, and Ube1x) novel in the context of stroke were also discovered. In conclusion, our result supports a dynamic multitarget therapy rather than the traditional approach of a unilateral and sustained modulation of a single target to address the phasic regulation of an ischemic proteome.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arnab Datta"", ids = ""28553664""); list(name = ""Qian Jingru"", ids = ""14138383""); list(name = ""T H Khor"", ids = ""47778957""); list(name = ""Muh Tyng Teo"", ids = ""35091544""); list(name = ""Klaus Heese"", ids = ""2726124""); list(name = ""Siu Kwan Sze"", ids = ""145270496"")",4776f9b21ac4380ecdb2975fde2d24290b181813; 410992769dccdef27a48fdb8b1cf3141a50f3b59; d58745e2f0a4c7dff9f81fbbe44306ab3b749138; 72f19f1c010822952a250c789ff1a12a6a1fde06; 39e63cc72d47b568f2381406c9224ef5c4c3b0e6; 371419c099f65f55bd36ba2aa6ac05bc4c69c2d9; 612cbd5d0c7a5069c9c8b6d9816677377a51afba; e3849f70ab40ba47dadd7883dc8eafe7a2c929b1; 2274f09b301f5f32b07b97331a706ce4a2f96a45; 0ef2ac20e8a83e02efa918c85666381a97a920c4; f4155d01195e94f784a0e6e22119f67f8213a024; e8a086fa5b9bb004b3063ceea07165ce7bc19746; 906c7c45a16e7175ce6a370bcfc6c528c1e1929f; 978b80382ac91d9f296142a75bba9a7a15e6196d; 41b3c9e7205ecd1bec64ceb5e901bed4bcda3920; a2aeca62308ae44788e7bc3159bb89647a166a28; 5fca0fd68162dddd5d797225ebbac4bcc7df1356; 47b6ba1750696a2fc9d1dbda3f6ee0011be13656; ad9838aa187cef5ce2b30c97868c30ffab94f319; 51841cbd1f935e6a1c3ca05620abb710f21a71de; abcc4bd904155363087168ac76c45688fa495047; 76625519121721b47048b5539a19fd6414fcd811; 13ce1dfbd03a63c9d6ac333d4e1a9b0f655667a7; 912a4c7156da64983472d12fa612d88bee9ef582; 484ad2fb17d00dcfbf13c9058525eb8147569264; 74f5e7afa69de833a2c3c62ddda1fa9a121b8aee; 5f1c52bde3fa6d864b5641ca0e08d412668d4f9a; 5c43f1e24903371965617327d68a26b302ceb033; 05c592b4ac8dfce28234e3ffe21a9fe85d66172a; 3f6f353682ceb6a66e52cc57614a3b399de49a99; b220daedf6579956f4988809876a6e87a7c43699,2dcc9dca41919443f6ea6cd7b78af6576e932c05; a65e111db063339305a25bf6437476db0231dbb7; f12c89fedd29ed553f1d97ce4b0f638b6bf96c1d; ef06d806368b608e919088872e86e59fbd53f943; 630207c046ee390704a5718def3e1a8a42b2a702; 8929f01bc9a788127bcff7a09432f4f7979c8e6b; 2020d7eba464324e7f63d40f864b0b7b34d21020; 4aed8066947b4918789ec68d67c50e68727d7ae7; babb6d7eeb133bfacede2e126c40d0619c1f4da4; 6fabeb5bce336debd258ed4051e0846f57159cf4; 196952d9ea50c0ba374ddbc3797b80a22b8b6be5; c0025b13d62ac6239d3d1dc08c2e99f0a0b8d79c; 1ae7acbdc82b466aaee4c0f1082843d61abbcec6; 644ce247783736127045a160252e56a6a825bb20; fb75a483893ee611e633a6b8cd9cd44a6226ab47; f836da820f53f5bbc890647ecbf00e1031f200c7; 50349c7b5372c96d96c90e0425f48e3dc0be01fc; 428cfa76d4c10092abbccccd315fc4be3363c12c; 91d61115f8a04330b26bde16e7b40de3167246ec; 07a3a2e770321f27c837da45fdf3b8d76524b290; b28cea8da06af2f0478862fbd1b528ad3c4f296a; ce6a521f5f15c4e6e7222c6e8d84b770548a2b0e; f25e3f21bf3cd90f1d91816a9544dbeb2fe1af12; a260bc50610766a23a29a1d35d62ad16f595fe3a; 355c4b4e1b7e9da442eea0896f662d5b59278c6b; a750fe8eeb6cb42cb6e170790fd962913f1d47f0; 6cc995ba2fb266df202226103fc5239958b9f32c; a7eb25c338d22e68fba12e89374563fd79fe534b; 80e0255a6e1e04a8762e66e57f2438469d7177f9; a224c17ce0bf8ef2f55eb68b53cd0a0228025769; 7f6eb4f34cd26dbc1fccd02e5dbb396d7c4575d4; eeb25a1dacd23671617a2dfae6073128a4b100d7; 14f1a5af8c7bace2104f18d53729c69949e1c6f8; b9fb71ac4add56ab7b7302e239c443f5fc7548b8; c64f8ed723fe94796b64f2274ddf333f12a7d271; b7e0e74e601e1e3cfc22d941da44cc9c874b085b; 4cab406f42879a3f9654a5f070628c48dd4e704b; 919412124be5e5eb36679fbb930a842bae42efb6; 8817d8a1f19587e981cfbd82f6810b2efba7cb2d; 267f4ff3f5727eecdd1df28daaa1536e544f9f8b; af38eeb306b9ba1a034845bf371564db3234eae8; d8b4be956c2d0d85c05af6e0f38924aa35139a72; 3aeb462caf0f65eaec8547ba95e4a31e10b1ed9d; b44024dde8bec89f893776365d55b6ebf0da3522; 00724dadbea8d8c1664a534f14295dff7a12bc27; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; d5a5b128a41f692e60729bf5793c0f2d3bf06835; cc9926dffc1f64c3fc0d7011d57ab20a4054141b; f7cc60b6cb87dd95f327b09e29e17e921aa70431; 8d84b50bcee6f24b727ef879a03b2be5eb56654a; 7609cf243fef9dff59b6db16184d9fdb05f53791; 720465962ef29e4ad4bc5f94761138a5a74c3aca; 398ceeb61761e20921eee1ac4f294fed3609e345; 536d29f2860252ef2af3ceb47944f9859842e461; 85675f464599530e0cf6612991f6bb498e4e8574; 5bba8bace03ade19b14e7e73591ed7895367335d; 198c19d7110fc680851f7145e0c6781a6e727f60; f52e5d116b6f45b05e1d920a42fbdc197f136952; 221946b8e1be0dd16e3bc1cfcd0bffe96404d0d7; d38110eabc09593dd06a7a3da9d20f5dd37b7aec; 4cc961c280b31f9ef99da80477b9e0df1149b3ce,Journal of proteome research,10 11,"

157d45f61df5adba9990cd7985b83c428c3c1cbe,"Normalization, bias correction, and peak calling for ChIP-seq","Next-generation sequencing is rapidly transforming our ability to profile the transcriptional, genetic, and epigenetic states of a cell. In particular, sequencing DNA from the immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA complexes (ChIP-seq) and methylated DNA (MeDIP-seq) can reveal the locations of protein binding sites and epigenetic modifications. These approaches contain numerous biases which may significantly influence the interpretation of the resulting data. Rigorous computational methods for detecting and removing such biases are still lacking. Also, multi-sample normalization still remains an important open problem. This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques. Statistical methods for separating ChIP-seq signal from background noise, as well as correcting enrichment test statistics for sequence-dependent and sonication biases, are presented. Our method effectively separates reads into signal and background components prior to normalization, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, most peak callers currently use a generic null model which suffers from low specificity at the sensitivity level requisite for detecting subtle, but true, ChIP enrichment. The proposed method of determining a cell type-specific null model, which accounts for cell type-specific biases, is shown to be capable of achieving a lower false discovery rate at a given significance threshold than current methods.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Aaron Diaz"", ids = ""143878464""); list(name = ""Kiyoub Park"", ids = ""12891579""); list(name = ""Daniel A.

de63a6504f2b9a486f176a4327370f431ca801b9,Use of quantitative gene expression in primary and highest Gleason pattern cancers to identify genes associated with clinical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.,"39 Background: Prostate biopsy may not adequately sample small, secondary or tertiary Gleason pattern tumors which can drive clinical outcome. We conducted a study to determine whether tumor-derived gene expression profiling could identify a distinct underlying biology associated with clinical recurrence (cR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) across both the primary and highest Gleason pattern (GP) samples.


METHODS
All patients (pts) with clinical stage T1/T2 prostate cancer treated with RP at Cleveland Clinic from 1987 to 2004 were identified (nâˆ¼f2,600). A cohort sampling design was used to select 127 patients with cR and 374 patients without cR after RP. Each patient had two spatially distinct tumor specimens sampled that included the primary GP and the highest GP. Surgical GS and clinical data were centrally reviewed. RNA was extracted from 6 manually dissected 10 Î¼ m fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections obtained from the RP tumor specimens and expression of 732 cancer-related and reference genes was quantified using RT-PCR. Clinical recurrence-free interval (cRFI) was analyzed using Cox PH regression.


RESULTS
Blocks from 441 patients were evaluable. Median F/U was 5.8 years. Pts were mostly Caucasian (83%), clinical stage T1 (66%), had baseline PSA <10 ng/mL (82%), and had surgical GS â‰¤7 (87%). As expected, surgical GP, biopsy GP, path T- stage, clin T-stage, baseline PSA, and year of surgery (p<0.05, unadj) were associated with cRFI. In the primary and highest GP specimens respectively, 295 and 297 genes were significantly associated (unadj. p<0.05) with cRFI. 235 genes were associated with cRFI in both specimens, well in excess of the number expected by chance. In a multivariate model adjusted for AUA risk group and allowing a 10% false discovery rate, 289 genes remained significantly and strongly associated with cRFI.


CONCLUSIONS
Gene expression analysis using quantitative RT-PCR identified a large number of genes, and underlying biology, that are strongly associated with clinical recurrence in both the primary and highest GP. This information can be used to develop a biopsy-based assay that distinguishes indolent versus aggressive disease. [Table: see text].",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric A.

b3abefbf25f796f4855b99c0a02b1c233136af11,Genome-wide Association Study of Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Traits: Shared Genetic Risk between Traits and Disorder,"This study examined the genetic correlates of obsessive-compulsive (OC) traits and their shared genetic risks with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We conducted genome-wide association analyses on OC traits in 5018 unrelated Caucasian children and adolescents. Overall OC traits and trait dimensions (e.g., cleaning/contamination) were measured with the Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive scale (TOCS). One locus tagged by rs7856850 in an intron of PTPRD (protein tyrosine phosphatase Î´) was associated with OC traits at the genome-wide significance level (p=2.48Ã—10âˆ’8). A variant in GRID2 was significantly associated with only the symmetry/ordering dimension (p=3.2Ã—10âˆ’8). We tested the role of central nervous system (CNS) and glutamate gene-sets using hypothesis-driven methods. A stratified False Discovery Rate found OC traits were associated with SNPs in three CNS genes: NPAS2 (p=7.8Ã—10âˆ’7), GRID2 (p=1.6Ã—10âˆ’6) and SH3GL2 (p=1.9Ã—10âˆ’7). The combined effect of neither the CNS development nor the glutamate gene-set were associated with OC traits using the competitive gene-set test implemented with MAGMA. We replicated the SNP in PTPRD in a meta-analysis of three independent OCD case/control genome-wide datasets (p=0.0069, cases=3384, controls=8363). Polygenic risk from OC traits was significantly associated with OCD in a sample of childhood-onset OCD and vice versa (pâ€™s<0.01). OC traits were highly but not significantly correlated with OCD (rg =0.83, p=0.07). We report the first replicated genome-wide significant variant for OCD traits. Our results indicate that OC traits in the general population share genetic risk with OCD in independent samples. This study demonstrates the feasibility and power of using trait-based approaches in community samples in psychiatric genomics.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Christie L.

Such metabolomic profiles, when analyzed together with transcriptional profiles, can reveal novel insights about underlying biological processes. While a number of conceptual approaches have been developed for data integration, easily accessible tools for integrated analysis of mammalian steady-state metabolomic and transcriptional data are lacking. Here we present GAM ('genes and metabolites'): a web-service for integrated network analysis of transcriptional and steady-state metabolomic data focused on identification of the most changing metabolic subnetworks between two conditions of interest. In the web-service, we have pre-assembled metabolic networks for humans, mice, Arabidopsis and yeast and adapted exact solvers for an optimal subgraph search to work in the context of these metabolic networks. The output is the most regulated metabolic subnetwork of size controlled by false discovery rate parameters. The subnetworks are then visualized online and also can be downloaded in Cytoscape format for subsequent processing.

80eaec30bb683fd346282d7f35a30ed65df170e5,STRetch: detecting and discovering pathogenic short tandem repeat expansions,"Short tandem repeat (STR) expansions have been identified as the causal DNA mutation in dozens of Mendelian diseases. Historically, pathogenic STR expansions could only be detected by single locus techniques, such as PCR and electrophoresis. The ability to use short read sequencing data to screen for STR expansions has the potential to reduce both the time and cost to reaching diagnosis and enable the discovery of new causal STR loci. Most existing tools detect STR variation within the read length, and so are unable to detect the majority of pathogenic expansions. Those tools that can detect large expansions are limited to a set of known disease loci and as yet no new disease causing STR expansions have been identified with high-throughput sequencing technologies. Here we address this by presenting STRetch, a new genome-wide method to detect STR expansions at all loci across the human genome. We demonstrate the use of STRetch for detecting pathogenic STR expansions in short-read whole genome sequencing data with a very low false discovery rate. We further demonstrate the application of STRetch to solve cases of patients with undiagnosed disease and apply STRetch to the analysis of 97 whole genomes to reveal variation at STR loci. STRetch assesses expansions at all STR loci in the genome and allows screening for novel disease-causing STRs.

f80c4742c1e1f0e679b04a6896a40ca48ffab4b3,Gene expression in fetal murine keratinocytes and fibroblasts.,"BACKGROUND
Early fetuses heal wounds without the formation of a scar. Many studies have attempted to explain this remarkable phenomenon. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we examine the predominant cell types of the epidermis and dermis--the keratinocyte and fibroblast--during different stages of fetal development to better understand the changes that lead to scarring wound repair versus regeneration.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were harvested and cultured from the dorsal skin of time-dated BALB/c fetuses. Total RNA was isolated and microarray analysis was performed using chips with 42,000 genes. Significance analysis of microarrays was used to select genes with >2-fold expression differences with a false discovery rate<2. Enrichment analysis was performed on significant genes to identify differentially expressed pathways.


RESULTS
By comparing the gene expression profile of keratinocytes from E16 versus E18 fetuses, we identified 24 genes that were downregulated at E16. Analysis of E16 and E18 fibroblasts revealed 522 differentially expressed genes. Enrichment analysis showed the top 20 signaling pathways that were downregulated in E16 keratinocytes and upregulated or downregulated in E16 fibroblasts.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data reveal 546 differentially expressed genes in keratinocytes and fibroblasts between the scarless and scarring transition. In addition, a total of 60 signaling pathways have been identified to be either upregulated or downregulated in these cell types. The genes and pathways recognized by our study may prove to be essential targets that may discriminate between fetal wound regeneration and adult wound repair.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Michael S Hu"", ids = ""6265041""); list(name = ""Michael Januszyk"", ids = ""3460851""); list(name = ""Wan Xing Hong"", ids = ""32868227""); list(name = ""Graham G Walmsley"", ids = ""4968716""); list(name = ""Elizabeth R.

We propose a bootstrap-based non-parametric ANOVA (NANOVA) method and a gene classification algorithm to classify genes into different groups according to the factor effects. The proposed method encompasses one-way and two-way models, as well as balanced and unbalanced experimental designs. False discovery rate (FDR) estimation is embedded in the procedure, and the method is robust to outliers. The gene classification algorithm is based on a series of NANOVA tests. The false discovery rate of each test is carefully controlled. Gene expression pattern in each group is modeled by a different ANOVA structure.

0c37e3d673868da750924424cc2d54a81a6d97c7,Delusions in Alzheimer Disease are Associated With Decreased Default Mode Network Functional Connectivity.,"OBJECTIVE
Approximately one-third of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) develop delusions. Delusions have been linked to numerous adverse outcomes, including worsened cognitive and functional decline, increased caregiver burden, and higher mortality rates. Previous studies have indicated that both AD and neuropsychiatric symptoms within AD are associated with abnormal functional connectivity of the resting brain, but no studies have focused on how delusions alter resting-state functional connectivity. The authors' objective was to test for differences in resting brain function between delusional and non-delusional patients with AD. The authors hypothesized that patients with AD with delusions would exhibit reduced connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) compared with patients with AD without delusions.


METHODS
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate differences in functional connectivity between 15 patients with AD with delusions and 15 comparable patients with AD without delusions. A group-level principal component analysis was used to identify functional networks accounting for greatest variability over all subjects, and the DMN was selected for between-group analysis. Dual regression was used to reconstruct individual subject component maps, and a two-sample t test was used to compare groups with and without delusion, adjusted at a false discovery rate of 0.05.


RESULTS
The two cohorts were comparable demographically and cognitively. The patients with delusions showed significantly reduced connectivity of the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) with the rest of the DMN.


CONCLUSION
Delusions in AD are associated with reduced connectivity within the DMN, specifically the left IPL. The authors' findings provide insight into the underlying neuropathophysiology of delusions in AD.",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Winnie Qian"", ids = ""2324349""); list(name = ""Corinne E.

9f1133eb95693e0b978ea122263ed8bf4c8fa93a,MicroRNA Profiling In Multiple Myeloma,"Abstract 302 Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy, characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). Prognostic factors in MM include translocations and ISS stage; still, the clinical course is difficult to predict. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding single stranded RNAs involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation, which may be of use in defining MM prognosis and outcome. MiRNAs regulate protein levels by binding to either partially or complete complementary sites in messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to translational repression or transcript degradation respectively. In this manner, miRNAs play a role in critical biological processes including cellular growth and differentiation. Specific disease related miRNAs in both acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found with specific miRNA signatures associated with different cytogenetic subtypes. Until now, information available for miRNA expression in MM is limited. Methods: MiRNA expression profiling was performed in 45 newly diagnosed MM patients enrolled in the HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 trial; a randomized, phase III trial performed to evaluate the efficacy of bortezomib prior to high-dose melphalan (HDM) for response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with newly diagnosed MM. As controls, four healthy BM samples were obtained from subjects undergoing BM harvest for allogeneic transplantation donorship. For all samples, BM derived CD138 selected plasma cells (PCs) with a minimum purity of > 80% were obtained. RNA was isolated using the miRVANA kit, with subsequent miRNA profiling by TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array v1.0. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with the centered correlation metric with average linkage was performed using BRB-array tools 3.6.0. For survival analysis, miRNA expression was divided in quartiles: the top quartile vs the rest to identify cases with high expression and the bottom quartile vs the rest for cases with low expression. Log-rank tests for univariate association with PFS and OS were performed for each of the 365 miRNAs using the false discovery rate to correct for multiple testing. Chromosomal abnormalities t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16) and deletion 13q14 were determined by FISH analysis. MiRNA expression was compared to mRNA expression, available for 39 out of 45 MM patients, using a Spearman9s rank correlation test. mRNA expression was determined by Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Broyl et al., Blood 2010). Results: Clustering resulted in a dendrogram with 5 clear branches, consisting of 4 MM clusters and 1 normal BM cluster. The MM clusters are characterized by up- and downregulation of distinctive miRNAs: cluster A: upregulation of miRNA clusters miRNA-17âˆ¼92 and miRNA-106âˆ¼25 (n=23); cluster B: upregulation of miRNA-130a and miRNA-424 (n=8); cluster C: upregulation of miRNA-576 and miRNA-106b (n=9) and cluster D: upregulation of miRNA-372 and miRNA-200a (n=4). An additional cluster of one sample was not defined. MiRNAs predominantly expressed in normal BM were miRNA-28 and miRNA-30c. None of the miRNA clusters correlated with cytogenetic subgroups, i.e. deletion 13q14, t(4;14), t(11;14), and t(14;16) Still, a supervised approach showed significantly higher expression of miRNA-122a, miRNA-33, miRNA-489, miRNA-519e, and miRNA-555 in patients with t(11;14). Upregulation of let-7f, miRNA-194 and miRNA-296 expression were found to be associated with better OS with borderline significance (P = .06). Finally, a significant inverse correlation between miRNA-21 expression and gene expression of two of its validated targets, PDCD4 (P = 2Ã— 10âˆ’4) and RECK (P = 8Ã—10âˆ’4) was found. PDCD4 is a novel tumor suppressor, whose functions include inhibition of translation through eIF4A/eIF4G. RECK has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis, through inhibition of MMP2 and MMP9. Conclusion: miRNA expression in MM is deregulated compared to normal PCs and MM patients can be classified according to their miRNA expression pattern in four clusters. Furthermore, a trend was found for high expression of miRNAs let-7f, miRNA-194 and miRNA-296 with increased OS. Integration of miRNA and mRNA data shows the putative interaction between miRNA-21 and two of its validated targets; tumor suppressor gene PDCD4 and RECK, suggesting a functional relationship between miRNA expression and development of MM.

1e7092714bcae917152790b22c26a36b4720a237,Mapping Splicing Quantitative Trait Loci in RNA-Seq,"Background One of the major mechanisms of generating mRNA diversity is alternative splicing, a regulated process that allows for the flexibility of producing functionally different proteins from the same genomic sequences. This process is often altered in cancer cells to produce aberrant proteins that drive the progression of cancer. A better understanding of the misregulation of alternative splicing will shed light on the development of novel targets for pharmacological interventions of cancer. Methods In this study, we evaluated three statistical methods, random effects meta-regression, beta regression, and generalized linear mixed effects model, for the analysis of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) using RNA-Seq data. All the three methods use exon-inclusion levels estimated by the PennSeq algorithm, a statistical method that utilizes paired-end reads and accounts for non-uniform sequencing coverage. Results Using both simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets, we compared these three methods with GLiMMPS, a recently developed method for sQTL analysis. Our results indicate that the most reliable and powerful method was the random effects meta-regression approach, which identified sQTLs at low false discovery rates but higher power when compared to GLiMMPS. Conclusions We have evaluated three statistical methods for the analysis of sQTLs in RNA-Seq.

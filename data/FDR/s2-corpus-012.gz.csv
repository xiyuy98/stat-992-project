89b1e15fab0dcae433278b6103a0cf184cc0f9fa,Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure and its removal induce a different miRNA expression pattern in primary cortical neuronal cultures.,"BACKGROUND
Increasing evidence indicates that repeated exposure to and withdrawal from alcohol can result in persistent molecular and cellular adaptations. One molecular adaptation that occurs is the regulation of gene expression, which is thought to lead to the functional alterations that characterize addiction: tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, craving, and relapse. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been recently identified as master regulators of gene expression through post-transcriptional regulation. However, the role of miRNAs in the neuroadaptations after alcohol removal has not yet been directly addressed.


METHODS
We employed a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) model in primary cortical neuronal cultures to examine the global extent of differential miRNA expression using a TaqMan real-time PCR miRNA array.


RESULTS
Sixty-two miRNAs were differentially expressed after 10 days of CIE (CIE10) treatment (n = 42 with false discovery rate [FDR]â€ƒ< 0.05 and fold change > 2) and 5 days post-CIE (P5) treatment (n = 26) compared with untreated control values. Compared to CIE10, ethanol (EtOH) removal experience in P5 induced a distinct expression pattern, including 20 differentially expressed miRNAs, which did not exhibit a significant change at CIE10. The predicted target molecules of EtOH removal-induced miRNAs function mainly in the regulation of gene transcription, but also function in neuron differentiation, embryonic development, protein phosphorylation, and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, some of the miRNAs differentially expressed 5 days after CIE treatment were found to cluster on chromosomes near CpG islands, suggesting that they share functional similarity by targeting alcohol-related genes.


CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, these results suggest a potential role of differentially expressed miRNAs in mediating EtOH removal-related phenotypes.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yingqiu Guo"", ids = ""46791270""); list(name = ""Yongxin Chen"", ids = ""123331860""); list(name = ""Stephanie Carreon"", ids = ""6079885""); list(name = ""Mei Qiang"", ids = ""152998143"")",ec5c97fc4aa7371ab33ca76da69f18b290108056; 4bbf9b12f937ea701e12c593830573a10f7fa52f; 2f5f43d14555b57576d1e9ece98f36f89d06d7a9; edac941dfd375c97a3f5870714a9f5b44346c14e; 27cd1787060025697231313041e9124804b02178; fa3d38f11d569fecce37771138bbf2ed1efbee04; c9e789ad0e0a9f621a13e6e75273f8ecf292dab4; d509c1933d25ae040a070d04c7d257b376276b16; 965edd11848a372f4f0a29de3ca9ff35d3cc2150; 12b1da822c06b952a1f9350048915610ffc08efe; b5c2b1f2a1d583d51f60b46d0be86fd93d82b961; 7939c9c115dfbbb1411c1c66e2f4c2b7b2426f83; 551fd990fa9e5ef3e8177f6743b8122fce0dc200; c1fbf0491e5893b6e5a14dcdaa048fe31f601745; 2afbfa191fa8db7e162cbc71a18490760517c55e; e81924ce16d1f8ece9bd6a27447da1d6d3d311fa; bf7c65bd269ef752be9acdca810a626df36ecba1; 338ee2304781759f469ab3e4300de461e5b1a992; 3b7a7a1e81d2f0f4616cf266f5ef9680b66412b5; 8b2c3e6eabe145d732d7a641c3ecd6b2f9b1e4c8; 8f0e68c6b74a0b24b87331725e310f7bb5fd0077; d6a8d48a3b6ebbdb63bc96a72b6caa165f4ae7dd; ddfe3fed6048f3341a6b8dfb33de8fce49de54f5; b6f469d0e13e324696bcc085a04b457b077b5e4f; dbac1402a9a6d75837988dba5e5eab2cef8d4993; a7476de753c5fc313f3c14c1101344e0080b7d72; 547877865a4cbc4ce7bf8c49487e37409b2c8d70; b16f15f78424d9f7c5e9f0a96eef2fac37423104; 9941e27e8f507cb2d9902a07c774b58498a5bb4e; cdd689dcb8a3bcc70051b85ea3044185cda4bdb2; 510ba80b5a4f70741bac14656793e161d4563b73; ff0a86393041d819847013a4820f82847e29e700; c4b029194bbcb20feac9b4b80cb87b6ac68f53b4; a1fb8b6b924741254c9e60e15e2745ed4a9b6005; 59f04c46c3b9a7ab3498d0463f4325b764c5f770,,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",36 6,"

e1268a72445b8b0fa90c9058d3206764f59b33ee,MicroRNAs associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma and their prognostic impacts in patients undergoing hepatic resection.,"Although microvascular invasion (McVI) has prognostic value for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have undergone hepatic resection, few studies have investigated the relationship between McVI and the aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). The present study identified the miRNAs that were selectively expressed in HCC with McVI and investigated their prognostic value. Clinical data and the miRNA expression profiles of 372 patients with HCC were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. miRNAs that were differentially expressed between patients with McVI and those without vascular invasion (VI) were identified and investigated as potential prognostic factors for HCC. The results demonstrated that McVI was a significant predictor of shortened recurrence-free survival (RFS). The 3 year RFS rate in patients with HCC accompanied by McVI was 28.2 and 49.3% in HCC without VI (P<0.001). miRNA-141/-582/-9 were upregulated, while miRNA-675 was downregulated in patients with McVI when compared with HCC patients without VI. Log2 fold-changes of miRNA-141/-582/-675/-9 were 0.80 [false discovery rate (FDR), 0.005], 0.55 (FDR, 0.045), -0.99 (FDR, 0.005) and 1.22 (FDR, <0.001), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the overexpression of miR-141/-582/-9 was significantly associated with poor RFS and a poor overall survival. A text mining analysis revealed that these miRNAs were significantly associated with multifaceted hallmarks of cancer, including 'invasion and metastasis'. In conclusion, the overexpression of miRNA-141/-582/-9 was associated with McVI and a poor survival in patients undergoing hepatic resection for HCC.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sung Kyu Song"", ids = ""3743737""); list(name = ""Min Geun Park"", ids = ""5446274""); list(name = ""Seung Keun Park"", ids = ""46570134""); list(name = ""Chul Woon Chung"", ids = ""3714069""); list(name = ""Yongkeun Park"", ids = ""49819480"")",,4fefb7e9fc95dfeec08113c46f6d880bbe62c5f0; a5f33e33c5922c4086ab805037f20867dcf66c49; 05721880eb2684042ec88ff608d3cb544942f574; 864ed3563ee4f93227a48a4c1f0e5311a5822241; b08080dce764d8ed5b693ce7541774f70aaf3fc6; b5376bc9af4b162d93d07ee45db7e1468f6015d7; b81aeb87245f9426a94ce11f18ee58bd4ca5cd9e; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; ba73ef1bd34a1bb1e829361f702a0386dfaa720b; 1bb445105c9e889330daacdbc4e8275004009cd9; 7969d2062b2f79b04ada272d3f7395d5f785499a; a824e2a7759b8bfef80604a041d047838303567d; c8e51ce4261a540ff13a75d28e5321ac221b10e0; a2bc889f6f0b2e4dbba29e8a55342ead46ced138; f8bcb0a31e08a0582e7caa10e32f744d86fced86; 9d55fd72725475a4f15085171473f11c7fb828b5; 1d3e725043efe8f1fae98c44e29d2e65948217a0; 26bcae6d9c240fc133310ca1ea07d8b8716e2122; eab710024c822d9a22586b1aef4456bf2bec169d; 6edc9d75362710a4c1a51c1a144d9d27a99c872d; 71994a8ce16a64ece4dffddd120b0d9ea850868b; 4f6d3ef9cc97db91ea125b7a9f2f8ca596e7c752; dd97b03a89a0aa95ccb866eb82d38b68f31879a8; e595e28dbacfb2a560d645c4c05c5992f30e9bfe; 204c7ec0f5d35e45393580b009a35423da1db7f3; bf38d6d8d7068f28696a32c9065f18f4aef15ede; 32857c90a42a343b337d36f3aa71c7c38eb8d932; 816f80ccabe43fabc3b6abc5dbd2149b6f76922f; 9b6882ef9c37a4f956d46bd0c853113ea9811e81; 220535c2cb40a58e49cda5dc0acd25f4a43e1ac7; 8ff32c56e5d8c3d611bb85b69963fd1c0ba62b3d; f72d1b8eabf42e78038b558782715fdf732c98d5; a90518a069ccb8cfd7c710c20a8d3ca41c772fe7; 7bc7cc5e3a4e62ce2306f07bfcb6fbc5df24a2bc; acdf8dbca6c554a566cf732b5663f8d3a85ca329,Oncology letters,18 6,"

dabf0d634fc0a8c9e5bf8b17efc1cb9541ea4288,A protein identification algorithm for tandem mass spectrometry by incorporating the abundance of mRNA into a binomial probability scoring model.,"Peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) scoring between the experimental and theoretical spectrum is a key step in the identification of proteins using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analyses. Efficient protein identification using MS/MS data remains a challenge. The strategy of using RNA-seq data increases the number of proteins identified by re-constructing the custom search database and integrating mRNA abundance into the false discovery rate of post-PSM. However, this process lacks an algorithm that can allow the incorporation of mRNA abundance into the key scoring model of PSM. Therefore, we developed a novel PSM scoring model, which incorporates mRNA abundance for improved peptide and protein identification. In the new algorithm, abundance information of mRNA was transformed to the prior probability of protein identification and integrated to re-score in PSM using the binomial probability distribution model. Compared with other algorithms using five MS/MS datasets, the results showed that the least improvement ratios of peptide and protein groups were 3.39%-9.79% and 0.48%-8.16% in different datasets (human, rat, zebrafish, yeast, and Arabidopsis thaliana). The new strategy offers an effective solution for MS-based identification of peptides and proteins. SIGNIFICANCE: The new algorithm identifies proteins by quantifying mRNA abundance (FPKM) and incorporating it into a scoring model for peptide-spectrum matches. It is important to improve peptide and protein identification from MS/MS datasets in proteomics research.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wen-Tai Ma"", ids = ""80646336""); list(name = ""Zhao-yu Liu"", ids = ""7768897""); list(name = ""Xiao-zhou Chen"", ids = ""121023234""); list(name = ""Zhen-Liang Lin"", ids = ""79302699""); list(name = ""Zhong-Bing Zheng"", ids = ""80081365""); list(name = ""Wei-guo Miao"", ids = ""153326908""); list(name = ""Shang-Qian Xie"", ids = ""2433280"")",f5f70d405f1e389720e2d585688d1bb9dd18455e,,Journal of proteomics,197,"

I begin with a short review of multi-resolutional kd-trees which are the building blocks for many of our algorithms. For example, quick range queries and fast N-point correlation functions. I will present new results from the use of Mixture Models (Connolly et al. 2000) in density estimation of multi-color data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Specifically, the selection of quasars and the automated identification of X-ray sources. I will also present a brief overview of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure (Miller et al. 2001a) and show how it has been used in the detection of â€œBaryon Wigglesâ€ in the local galaxy power spectrum and source identification in radio data.

cc736f755edadbcafe5c330d2d814822460083cf,Folate network genetic variation predicts cardiovascular disease risk in non-Hispanic white males.,"Genes functioning in folate-mediated 1-carbon metabolism are hypothesized to play a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk beyond the current narrow focus on the MTHFR 677 Câ†’T (rs1801133) polymorphism. Using a cohort study design, we investigated whether sequence variants in the network of folate-related genes, particularly in genes encoding proteins related to SHMT1, predict CVD risk in 1131 men from the Normative Aging Study. A total of 330 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 52 genes, selected for function and gene coverage, were assayed on the Illumina GoldenGate platform. Age- and smoking-adjusted genotype-phenotype associations were estimated in regression models. Using a nominal P â‰¤ 5.00 Ã— 10(-3) significance threshold, 8 SNPs were associated with CVD risk in single locus analyses. Using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold (P-adjusted â‰¤1.00 Ã— 10(-1)), a SNP in the GGH gene remained associated with reduced CVD risk, with a stronger association in early onset CVD cases (<55 y). A gene Ã— folate interaction (MAT2B) and 2 gene Ã— vitamin B-12 interactions (BHMT, SLC25A32) reached the FDR P-adjusted â‰¤2.00 Ã— 10(-1) threshold. Three biological hypotheses related to SHMT1 were explored and significant gene Ã— gene interactions were identified for TYMS by UBE2N, FTH1 by CELF1, and TYMS by MTHFR. Variations in genes other than MTHFR and those directly involved in homocysteine metabolism are associated with CVD risk in non-Hispanic white males. This work supports a role for SHMT1-related genes and nuclear folate metabolism, including the thymidylate biosynthesis pathway, in mediating CVD risk.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Susan M.

The proteomics chip uses 2 antibodies for each protein and a polymerase chain reaction step to achieve a high-specific binding and the possibility to measure multiple proteins in parallel, but gives no absolute concentrations. Resultsâ€”In PIVUS, 16 proteins were related to incident ischemic stroke using a false discovery rate of 5%.

1b1cf9d178e83e4450e93b9706f6075b77436d0f,MICC: an R package for identifying chromatin interactions from ChIA-PET data,"UNLABELLED
ChIA-PET is rapidly emerging as an important experimental approach to detect chromatin long-range interactions at high resolution. Here, we present Model based Interaction Calling from ChIA-PET data (MICC), an easy-to-use R package to detect chromatin interactions from ChIA-PET sequencing data. By applying a Bayesian mixture model to systematically remove random ligation and random collision noise, MICC could identify chromatin interactions with a significantly higher sensitivity than existing methods at the same false discovery rate.

To our knowledge this is the largest reported set of skeletal muscle proteins in livestock. Comparison with human muscle proteome demonstrated a low level of false positives with 83% of the proteins common to both proteomes. In addition, for the first time we assess variations in the muscle proteome caused by sexually dimorphic gene expression and diet dephytinization. Preliminary analysis identified 19 skeletal muscle proteins differentially expressed between male and female pigs (> or = 1.2-fold, p<0.05), but only one of them, GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, was significant (p<0.05) after false discovery rate correction. Diet dephytinization affected expression of 20 proteins (p<0.05). This study would contribute to an evaluation of the suitability of the pig as a model to study human gender-related differences in gene expression.

Recent studies have shown that epigenetic modifications play a role in multiple myeloma (MM) by silencing various cancer-related genes. We investigated the epigenetic genes differentially expressed between normal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC ; N=5) and MM plasma cells from patients (N=206). Using SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) analysis, only 12 genes significantly differentially expressed between BMPC and MM cells (ratio > 2 and FDR (false discovery rate) Clinical trials are ongoing with EZH2 inhibitors in lymphoma and could be promising for a subgroup of MM patients in combination with IMiDs. Furthermore, the EZ score enables identification of MM patients with an adverse prognosis and who could benefit from treatment with EZH2 inhibitors.

2090e3bdf19a7581cf13e6ee354a008007c6f611,Disrupted network architecture of the resting brain in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"BACKGROUND
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders of childhood. Neuroimaging investigations of ADHD have traditionally sought to detect localized abnormalities in discrete brain regions. Recent years, however, have seen the emergence of complementary lines of investigation into distributed connectivity disturbances in ADHD. Current models emphasize abnormal relationships between default network-involved in internally directed mentation and lapses of attention-and task positive networks, especially ventral attention network. However, studies that comprehensively investigate interrelationships between large-scale networks in ADHD remain relatively rare.


METHODS
Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 757 participants at seven sites in the ADHD-200 multisite sample. Functional connectomes were generated for each subject, and interrelationships between seven large-scale brain networks were examined with network contingency analysis.


RESULTS
ADHD brains exhibited altered resting state connectivity between default network and ventral attention network [Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected], including prominent increased connectivity (more specifically, diminished anticorrelation) between posterior cingulate cortex in default network and right anterior insula and supplementary motor area in ventral attention network. There was distributed hypoconnectivity within default network (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009, FDR-corrected), and this network also exhibited significant alterations in its interconnections with several other large-scale networks. Additionally, there was pronounced right lateralization of aberrant default network connections.


CONCLUSIONS
Consistent with existing theoretical models, these results provide evidence that default network-ventral attention network interconnections are a key locus of dysfunction in ADHD. Moreover, these findings contribute to growing evidence that distributed dysconnectivity within and between large-scale networks is present in ADHD.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chandra Sekhar Sripada"", ids = ""1762425""); list(name = ""Daniel Kessler"", ids = ""144708210""); list(name = ""Yu Fang"", ids = ""145746753""); list(name = ""Robert C.

85d433a711c492f6d697723487977de28a52563b,Plasticity and Response to Action Observation,"Background. Action observation has been suggested as a possible gateway to retraining arm motor function post stroke. However, it is unclear if the neuronal response to action observation is affected by stroke and if it changes during the course of recovery. Objective. To examine longitudinal changes in neuronal activity in a group of patients with subacute stroke when observing and executing a bimanual movement task. Methods. Eighteen patients were examined twice using 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging; 1 to 2 weeks and 3 months post stroke symptom onset. Eighteen control participants were examined once. Image time series were analyzed (SPM8) and correlated with clinical motor function scores. Results. During action observation and execution, an overlap of neuronal activation was observed in the superior and inferior parietal lobe, precentral gyrus, insula, and inferior temporal gyrus in both control participants and patients (P < .05; false discovery rate corrected). The neuronal response in the observation task increased from 1 to 2 weeks to 3 months after stroke. Most activated clusters were observed in the inferior temporal gyrus, the thalamus and movement-related areas, such as the premotor, supplementary and motor cortex (BA4, BA6). Increased activation of cerebellum and premotor area correlated with improved arm motor function. Most patients had regained full movement ability. Conclusions. Plastic changes in neurons responding to action observation and action execution occurred in accordance with clinical recovery. The involvement of motor areas when observing actions early and later after stroke may constitute a possible access to the motor system.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Iris Brunner"", ids = ""38642452""); list(name = ""Jan Sture Skouen"", ids = ""3795328""); list(name = ""Lars Ersland"", ids = ""2475170""); list(name = ""Renate GrÃ¼ner"", ids = ""2344400"")",31e71ffa6fc2cb281ee0afd1fe8d8599fb076d49; 43c8184e8fb72fa621b1fd6f440371875421b536; 37185f2505bf7899f81373068726d0aa98595e9f; 5bbbbe018430e6fbdaa5e3c4cc9987ba3901ba3c; 8579150c797aa7b817f3c9616a96f2c2e85bf55b; 75e962aa5c9a9916ec8f324117377b4200153c62; 25ed5d3ce625850e568c98e3d7966767f8fb4b95; f510f68c17287257980e0647d717873c62dbffce; 793ad9379eb3af33de88f1f7fe82155887d2c669; dfd29599382a5b2cc52560b284028eeb23b09391; fa98928659bfc0de9d9904f84ea4a37d530ca795; 55eacabd0c4de228d8c4cc1b6cd8a15c751c2175; e1eae3e0684c058a71c221beb2f675b338e70441; 148c04830580b26b266125bf82dacae375c7dc85; 6c54685299cd17674ef4b12f5299d6c1e717d092; 2055107072592b43e0aa2fcbee64910c37c09c90; 72feedf033e8532895dee1fdbcaf8ecd1299cddb; b5c007b162643a7a5980b70d7c79fdd345a34fb3; bef1e580e74354e496ebabd8fc096456b7ff67eb,b77c9c18dde2506e1805b275e3ebc8c35978940f; 8b018847a79c15489689a1a7964049a5de41f119; d2dc8ee828fbcc2a24263ed49c2505793a978440; 721f6e4d7c5b540730ef08afd0a045342086e360; 74ab729d2b3e5e475e97cb33274fa6177a440690; fb1fbfe04f1010385d0e42284aadfc01486f6bda; bc757bbb67ee34d77124f79e6a305bc929ec1bfd; a706b4e4089dac24d49788a6925229b2e5618859; d5f2868992c80980b494c542481efe66acc3141e; 4160afebba8a39116664d32bc18fe14b649ab5c2; 589646e9a2b9b7d7401fa6ad8869b94b5b909636; 1c462751c69086925438ddb7b34e630b33a875f8; 61136ea2fb55d624ab7f36a727afa1aace8577b0; 2bf3ac48a69f1b92589b4edc3e7ee3b11257a4ec; a0be416067e834cfc5a483ac00a65b4f3f9e94e6; 9f834c02cf0322032845cfe90491b2707ccebca1; a204471ad4722a5e4ade844f8a25aa1c1037e1c1; fee623ce8cb964a53cc1849007758aa5a32490b7; 0ef550dacb89fb655f252e5b17dbd5d643eb5ac1; efe88557485dc181f8b4d43b252d19963890fa66; 21bca16ae8b1db9875ddbcd890ec083f43b24760; 59d645829644dd75a968e330b713093a886e3e01; 22ffac1b8b4c19fedad8871468c81c0b2dc3db8d; 19907c709e4e5b27b8cbde57846d096112098bba; dc7c3edfe7c82b65ad052c08f8f795c7e3f11ae4; 0d2d41b713fb1d30e2f0d263cf4cc79cd0f88ff2; 849dcf60c30cd0b3a075aa109a38321692ae36a5; 6d69cc76de0a10aa4a34c1aa3796cd78845e156b; df5cc0fb4c12cd7164e9d094fef6c18393daab8e; e4fb30b57845d705f7c5723008172c9f6e7bbb0d; a7a2ef89b64758a8248259adbaa098c28b0bf725; 95a4d827b0ae3797a9dc7260c9df92c1a140faf1; 154e967b29980cb3f93ddc6f9faa29c511bc003a; 242693a9ae329b868d3077f79e449d975b3f2665; 440ef873ee9287e2b2f6f8a1a0402e69a7d79adf; 3a1ebce9a9fc580e13394e6941db6a14c6c703d0; ec8a7ef903999106d7ffbb8f87744bf470da9945; 4854bd25d153e7ab3c6387d84cf298afaa79e96f,Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair,28,874 - 884

dbbe2bd933d0776efd502be40df28930447ac541,A dataâ€driven search for semenâ€related phenotypes in conception delay,"Sperm count, morphology, and motility have been reported to be predictive of pregnancy, although with equivocal basis prompting some authors to question the prognostic value of semen analysis. To assess the utility of including semen quality data in predicting conception delay or requiring >6 cycles to become pregnant (referred to as conception delay), we utilized novel data-driven analytic techniques in a pre-conception cohort of couples prospectively followed up for time-to-pregnancy. The study cohort comprised 402 (80%) male partners who provided semen samples and had time-to-pregnancy information. Female partners used home pregnancy tests and recorded results in daily journals. Odds ratios (OR), false discovery rates, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for conception delay (time-to-pregnancyÂ >Â 6 cycles) were estimated for 40 semen quality phenotypes comprising 35 semen quality endpoints and 5 closely related fecundity determinants (body mass index, time of contraception, lipids, cotinine and seminal white blood cells). Both traditional and strict sperm phenotype measures were associated with lower odds of conception delay. Specifically, for an increase in percent morphologically normal spermatozoa using traditional methods, we observed a 40% decrease in conception delay (ORÂ =Â 0.6, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.50, 0.81; pÂ =Â 0.0003). Similarly, for an increase in strict criteria, we observed a 30% decrease in odds for conception delay (ORÂ =Â 0.7, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.52, 0.83; pÂ =Â 0.001). On the other hand, an increase in percent coiled tail spermatozoa was associated with a 40% increase in the odds for conception delay (ORÂ =Â 1.4, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.12, 1.75; pÂ =Â 0.003). However, our findings suggest that semen phenotypes have little predictive value of conception delay (area under the curve of 73%).

3daa7f7db58fd45b06beb3b0b7e3708de45ab1d8,Transcriptome analysis of the livers of ducklings hatched normally and with assistance,"OBJECTIVE
""Hatchability"" is an important economic trait in domestic poultry. Studies on poultry hatchability focus mainly on the genetic background, egg quality, and incubation conditions, whereas the molecular mechanisms behind the phenomenon that some ducklings failed to break their eggshells are poorly understood.


METHODS
In this study, the transcriptional differences between the livers of normally hatched and assisted ducklings were systematically analyzed.


RESULTS
The results showed that the clean reads were de novo assembled into 161,804 and 159,083 unigenes (â‰¥200-bp long) by using Trinity, with an average length of 1,206 bp and 882 bp, respectively. The defined criteria of the absolute value of log2 fold-change â‰¥1 and false discovery rateâ‰¤0.05 were differentially expressed and were significant. As a result, 1,629 unigenes were identified, the assisted ducklings showed 510 significantly upregulated and 1,119 significantly down-regulated unigenes. In general, the metabolic rate in the livers of the assisted ducklings was lower than that in the normal ducklings; however, compared to normal ducklings, glucose-6-phosphatase and ATP synthase subunit alpha 1 associated with energy metabolism were significantly upregulated in the assisted group. The genes involved in immune defense such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen alpha chain and MHC class II beta chain 1 were downregulated in the assisted ducklings.


CONCLUSION
These data provide abundant sequence resources for studying the functional genome of the livers in ducks and other poultry. In addition, our study provided insight into the molecular mechanism by which the phenomenon of weak embryos is regulated.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yali Liu"", ids = ""49421828""); list(name = ""Shishan He"", ids = ""15785079""); list(name = ""Tao Zeng"", ids = ""145949542""); list(name = ""Xue Du"", ids = ""145570849""); list(name = ""Junda Shen"", ids = ""7024952""); list(name = ""Ayong Zhao"", ids = ""32530862""); list(name = ""Lizhi Lu"", ids = ""32182188"")",675e7a9dd420034d052320afdceef344bef45d83; 7cad25fa2becc64b1af94e8b09669fb4a005b29f; 25a50d70b7aa2c986f98bed722c71657e4917f00,171fbd06504871fcf643ef6f0e981fcdfbcacb04; a9c8130cf93080224e960f0dd0c46bd236cc6282; 559c75fcf22e50d02fc6b99a9bac06b8b7734fa1; 20e50283ec533173b20c83e08633136ba940b724; 8097f4cd50ca646bb656a2ed3e1f6eb6e25d57cd; 012b4fa96376c1e6f20f25a426a038fe3f3b5bc4; 988d8004f190469af89d16b3fd587cbd892460c1; 17863d227a8523625801fe8888c76ecf6047f313; a0233c787efae9f0d91e5f2e2c3ec053061794a7; 999a237f25feaca00c45d65bfad2c4ccdad2c9f1; a203b779f0d5e9b297d8cc3b8d71da536d242b80; abee6eb9532f7a0e1bf026756bcd48b9d0774b23; 67e82fafe22cd05032ab2bff941e9a8ad7527fbc; 97d96147f4d21c1a3ed0a5d860bc4d66e8e3bfed; 3afcf5cd92c824e192da25465b30fe78883301c2; 551da8484d03b57752ce707bc2f52c53e98e6cc5; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 7ed32b0cc8d667cb82f3216d604a1d96d8191637; 51b52a3f8dab065b5d9a747189888acb7f862545; a5a5eb2b8426c0a02ec553e36c93258abbec397f; 3a15be2b16d157d9cae688b293a032f515ca48eb; 4fe824722cc058f79d32e5828066b150a8e2640c; 69c8171cdc0adbfa2080251c5d61a93c3a3ce9bf; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; d4617a8fb475483c0b1f727403ee95bc5faa34b1; 3c40bcf5f18e66c10f03b12474e0f3761ed97ad1; 10f70623e301373b8a541e136683278ab7676bba; 935ffb4c895909a97d0c29a3a9748dd3262f7c64; 13ceda93a3f46544d59fad1c22c6e07c03bf515a; 062dc877eab713a608194992e71a42ad0606385a; 471c7c96bf7d964112602be590db0c2ae635cc9c; a82586c65073a1971259f2cfe2122e0ff03e2a09,Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences,30,773 - 780
ec1848721f4f524b2d96c1abe9cb1fc62e3bb1b0,Optimal FDR control in the two-group model,"The highly influential two group model in testing a large number of statistical hypothesis assumes that the test statistics come from a mixture of a high probability null distribution and a low probability alternative. Optimal control of the marginal false discovery rate (mFDR), in the sense that it provides maximal power (expected true discoveries) subject to mFDR control, is achieved by thresholding the local false discovery rate (locFDR) with a fixed threshold. In this paper we address the challenge of controlling the popular false discovery rate (FDR) rather than mFDR in the two group model. Since FDR is less conservative, this results in more rejections. We derive the optimal multiple testing (OMT) policy for this task, which turns out to be thresholding the locFDR with a threshold that is a function of the entire set of statistics. We show how to evaluate this threshold in time that is linear in the number of hypotheses, leading to an efficient algorithm for finding this policy. Thus, we can easily derive and apply the optimal procedure for problems with thousands of hypotheses. We show that for K=5000 hypotheses there can be significant power gain in OMT with FDR versus mFDR control.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ruth Heller"", ids = ""144622349""); list(name = ""Saharon Rosset"", ids = ""1816048"")",,37c21a0937505d63a844204050455948b84c8a6a; aecc3b421bf4aff3f1743a2f6cfc865203909474; 5043fd247ee67d229bfb656264d634abc44518f7; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; bcf806c48efad2a1a2ba2a22dc6a24fa126203e6; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; be32051f6780f3de74952ef28ad5c834c5eb8cc3; 2ac5e637a01b40b70003e67234afd3edd0c54095,arXiv: Methodology,,

Using MRI data from 67 healthy (30 men, 10 nondextral) and 84 schizophrenia patients (60 men, 16 nondextral), cortical thickness asymmetries were compared at high spatial resolution. Within-group asymmetries were observed in sensorimotor, perisylvian, and parahippocampal cortices (leftward) and in anterior mesial frontal cortices (rightward). Asymmetry patterns were similar across diagnosis and sex, although some regional asymmetry increases were observed in men. Hand preference (dextrality) significantly influenced regional asymmetries in parietal association and dorsomedial frontal cortices (false discovery rate-corrected), where medial-frontal regions showed diagnosis by dextrality effects (uncorrected). Thus, dextrality relates to cortical thickness asymmetries, although schizophrenia may differentially affect asymmetry patterns across handedness.",2007,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Liberty S.

3c32b58d45f761a1f6e81dad3c9605a8135a1ff4,Online Control of the False Coverage Rate and False Sign Rate.,"The false coverage rate (FCR) is the expected ratio of number of constructed confidence intervals (CIs) that fail to cover their respective parameters to the total number of constructed CIs. Procedures for FCR control exist in the offline setting, but none so far have been designed with the online setting in mind. In the online setting, there is an infinite sequence of fixed unknown parameters $\theta_t$ ordered by time. At each step, we see independent data that is informative about $\theta_t$, and must immediately make a decision whether to report a CI for $\theta_t$ or not. If $\theta_t$ is selected for coverage, the task is to determine how to construct a CI for $\theta_t$ such that $\text{FCR} \leq \alpha$ for any $T\in \mathbb{N}$. A straightforward solution is to construct at each step a $(1-\alpha)$ level conditional CI. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the problem inspired by online false discovery rate (FDR) algorithms, which only requires the statistician to be able to construct a marginal CI at any given level. Apart from the fact that marginal CIs are usually simpler to construct than conditional ones, the marginal procedure has an important qualitative advantage over the conditional solution, namely, it allows selection to be determined by the candidate CI itself. We take advantage of this to offer solutions to some online problems which have not been addressed before. For example, we show that our general CI procedure can be used to devise online sign-classification procedures that control the false sign rate (FSR). In terms of power and length of the constructed CIs, we demonstrate that the two approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses using simulations.

Despite remarkable progress in the past decade, the molecular basis of prostate cancer development and progression remains incompletely understood. Owing to the rapid advancement of next generation sequencing technologies, whole-genome and -transcriptome sequencing have been increasingly applied to analyze prostate cancer. In comparison, whole-proteome sequencing of prostate cancer remains very challenging. Here, by applying three different endoproteinases (i.e., trypsin, Glu-C and Asp-N) and two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we generated a high-resolution and quantitative proteomic map for DU145, a widely used human prostate cancer cell line. A total of 11,759 non-redundant protein groups were identified with a false discovery rate of 1%, corresponding to 10,561 genes. The absolute abundance of each identified protein was computed, ranging from 110 million to several copies (median = 35,700 copies). In addition, a recent RNA-Seq analysis of DU145 cells suggested that only 10,964 genes have FPKM values of ? 1, indicating that our proteomic profiling covers almost the entire proteome. Among the 10,561 identified genes, at least 904 (e.g., BRAF, BRCA1, EZH2, FGFR1, HNF1B, and STAT3) express two to eight different protein isoforms, some of which have not been characterized before. In addition, proteogenomic analysis identified over 40 aberrant proteins derived from alternative splicing and site mutation as well as translation from 5â€™UTR, long non-coding RNAs, and pseudogenes. In conclusion, we generated the first near-complete quantitative proteomic map for prostate cancer cells, which may guide the discovery of prostate cancer-specific protein biomarkers.

301d15c9ca7a9349de999d9e49ec54c61371f81d,swDMR: A Sliding Window Approach to Identify Differentially Methylated Regions Based on Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing,"DNA methylation is a widespread epigenetic modification that plays an essential role in gene expression through transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. The emergence of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) represents an important milestone in the detection of DNA methylation. Characterization of differential methylated regions (DMRs) is fundamental as well for further functional analysis. In this study, we present swDMR (http://sourceforge.net/projects/swDMR/) for the comprehensive analysis of DMRs from whole genome methylation profiles by a sliding window approach. It is an integrated tool designed for WGBS data, which not only implements accessible statistical methods to perform hypothesis test adapted to two or more samples without replicates, but false discovery rate was also controlled by multiple test correction. Downstream analysis tools were also provided, including cluster, annotation and visualization modules. In summary, based on WGBS data, swDMR can produce abundant information of differential methylated regions. As a convenient and flexible tool, we believe swDMR will bring us closer to unveil the potential functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhen Wang"", ids = ""32037060""); list(name = ""Xianfeng Li"", ids = ""50079659""); list(name = ""Yi Jiang"", ids = ""145269150""); list(name = ""Qianzhi Shao"", ids = ""46380775""); list(name = ""Qi Liu"", ids = ""47362604""); list(name = ""Bingyu Chen"", ids = ""47440048""); list(name = ""Dongsheng Huang"", ids = ""1780180"")",e4fd6ece599f79f0b6c275372e792cefffb89361; 1270a88fb48662c1a2effb36fd527cf99bc15fdf; 7b3aecd4ea827a9faf90c8f34d5a4febc4e870db; fb4230693ae817a7c921ba366fb68efe7a643c7b; a1a3e2eb18f32a1bf8d920a74f2211b3589c10a8; e9de19fec8e49f661a8656fe548f1de45b25e35b; b3eac7fe3a3b96ee6104b37fe68029e4c81516ba; e9e9d99438d7d30db52ecb5629082f58b76d3f05; b4bab0c96ae7134384f2fc2e5d0f0cff120be1f7; 252a4e7992dd3d78696e5ebbdb7cbbaca333b611; c7c75053f9c280bcb856473574b1c5b2c9dae182; 49a54d059e6b9b30824f7c9582a3f8b19b22c4d3; c9352abcc53b36e3fab9ad4e21f56b1e077b3a9d; 84aaf7200f062c2456cbbf2472edc6d091fe220f; 200767593ffb892dc1da86ede820b65c00a1495d; ff35624caee55e5818f6c7cb6947b500f1b60a29; c8e6fa1470d078459824b9c9650f95ae5e027ef9,f7c40bd0112b5c9efe530d3fe0d450229e570234; 053dc63f7dfcde03e28c120f3a9abe613242e2a6; 2900824bc827a70f04a56f082c96cdcb957c3951; b9d34a09693b31ad5c28ef51938dc9cbc8f1dd76; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 458c710edad89bdac80086da07a8e19dc2c6002f; 4de91ae462b9106e779a52ff0514f0b060702326; 67c4801e4d7a2740576a44fcaecaeb53d16914b1; 067097b814fba7fe46585e7888bade78d8754367; 805ab6da8bf38714874a4674f845151376af67c4; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; f14b49d2b8459ad9861d1bd0b52260513a7e446f; 1e06b3178f8a5d049ab996fa90570652687c7cf2; 85350c2a270a760864721c3ed36996ed5409a243; e0bdf416f117ecb4ff15a6d3571e105918128934; eabd2d0b524614fd87fb14e2b4a7a0b87cdd9efb; 6fb2a3e7a025fa2288c7fdf970f5201b50ada31e; b9a3f6ee99fcd8d9f343c37e2d9112573ba7c46a; a2f30c42940b61cf02b2ee758ecaa2da3a4685c1; 1c1e53dabd2af511e9b9d424ed21c7cebbf2eca7; cf6312de39796f94b8607da718aa516942024925; f254c8a064e3c0a547873b25255a33033965482d; d0cb295ce34566cad15000ab3f2d1391698c7e61; 55557c0ebc71ff48881ef0c8531fc1bea4c28b5c; ced5bb274877737921b0e71c311e9043d480021c; 6503d27f003c2e50e91bf04d9b5a17401345d12d; 3e3fbd588b1deebdf12c298cf6526a7e5d1a2e60; 68bb98e2b1fa6631229f2780524c2e263ba2f1ac; 5cfa393e32dbc0003c903ee98cb424022cd581f4; f9e02232a145ba69c37eeaa331a58510c05a1563,PLoS ONE,10,
dcaf6ce246e2db12b369c8f2700e1b88b3830923,Comparing Genomic Profiles of Women With and Without Fibromyalgia,"Background: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a chronic musculoskeletal condition characterized by diffuse pain, fatigue, sleep impairment, and cognitive dysfunction, is associated with significant functional disability. Its underlying biological mechanisms are unknown. This study investigated differentially expressed genes between women with FMS and healthy volunteers. Methods: Women who met the 1990 or 2010 American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia criteria were compared to age- and race-matched pain-free healthy women. Peripheral blood samples were collected, and a full genome microarray gene expression analysis was performed. One-way analysis of variance was used to identify differentially expressed genes using the filtering criterion of 1% false discovery rate. Analysis of canonical pathways associated with these genes was performed. Confirmatory quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay verified microarray results. Independent t-tests compared gene and protein expression between groups. Result: Participants were 54 women with FMS and 25 controls. Expression arrays from a subset of women with FMS (n = 29) and controls (n = 20) showed upregulation of 12 genes (>1.8-fold change, p < .05) in the FMS sample. Differentially expressed genes were related to B-cell development, primary immunodeficiency signaling, and mitotic roles of polo-like kinase. CENPK and HSP90AA1 were the most differentially expressed genes (p < .01). Conclusion: Activity of interrelated pathways related to immune response, and homeostasis appears to be relevant to the experience of FMS. Replication and exploration of the relationship between gene expression and symptom severity will help determine clinical relevance of these findings.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nada Lukkahatai"", ids = ""3566892""); list(name = ""Brian T.

8b036dc93672ed0e71b8b5fc2f92ff05954dc6f3,Candidate Agents for Papillary Thyroid Cancer Identified by Gene Expression Analysis,"A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is needed to manage these patients effectively. Our objectives were to expand our understanding of this disease, and to identify biologically active small molecules capable to reverse PTC. We downloaded gene expression data of PTC from Gene Expression Omnibus database and employed computational bioinformatics analysis to compare gene expression patterns with normal tissues. Small molecules that induced inverse gene changes to the PTC were identified. A total of 2,154 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a false discovery rate of 0.01 were identified.

50d80d1862484abea6358da40fbe05ea5f18d7af,Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Ischemic Stroke of Different Etiologies Have Distinct Alternatively Spliced mRNA Profiles in the Blood: a Pilot RNA-seq Study,"Whole transcriptome studies have used 3â€²-biased expression microarrays to study genes regulated in the blood of stroke patients. However, alternatively spliced messenger RNA isoforms have not been investigated for ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in animals or humans. Alternative splicing is the mechanism whereby different combinations of exons of a single gene produce distinct mRNA and protein isoforms. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to determine if alternative splicing differs for ICH and cardioembolic, large vessel and lacunar causes of ischemic stroke compared to controls. RNA libraries from 20 whole blood samples were sequenced to 200Â M 2â€‰Ã—â€‰100Â bp reads using Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis technology. Differential alternative splicing was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and differential exon usage was calculated. Four hundred twelve genes displayed differential alternative splicing among the groups (false discovery rate, FDR; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). They were involved in cellular immune response, cell death, and cell survival pathways. Distinct expression signatures based on usage of 308 exons (292 genes) differentiated the groups (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0005; fold change >|1.2|). This pilot study demonstrates that alternatively spliced genes from whole blood differ in ICH compared to ischemic stroke and differ between different ischemic stroke etiologies.

ce7ff9188930c996558453bf439047889e1e5dc1,"Protein-Level Evidence of Novel Î²-Type Hemocyanin and Heterogeneous Subunit Usage in the Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei","The functional diversity of crustacean hemocyanins is broad, encompassing O2 delivery, innate immune response, metabolite storage, and osmolyte balance, all in a heterogeneous protein structure. As such, the sequence diversity of this class of proteins and its subunit composition are the focus of many studies on crustacean adaptation to environmental challenges. Recent transcriptomic and genomic assemblies on the Pacific whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei have identified unique isoforms of hemocyanin including an ancestral Î²-type subunit thought to be lost in penaeid shrimp. However, it is unknown the degree to which these isoforms are translated as proteins, and their abundances within the hemolymph. The present study uses proteomic approaches to characterize the protein-level abundance and organization of these hemocyanin isoforms within their native oligomeric structures. Fractions of each hemocyanin oligomeric form were purified by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography for identification of subunit isoforms using tandem mass spectrometry at <1% protein false discovery rate. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD014575. Relative abundances of hemocyanin oligomers and monomeric subunits from hemolymph and fractions were also quantified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with and without denaturation for comparison of subunit heterogeneity. Hemocyanin subunits were organized primarily as hexamers (95-99% relative abundance) as opposed to dodecamers. Ten unique hemocyanins predicted by transcriptome and genome assemblies were identified by tandem mass spectrometry in both oligomer fractions including the first protein-level evidence of a Î²-type subunit in penaeid shrimp. Identified hemocyanins mapped to four genomic scaffolds and had two or three exons. A single small (75 kDa) subunit constituted half or more of all isoforms identified in each oligomer. The dodecameric fraction exhibited greater subunit heterogeneity utilizing a significantly lower ratio (1.04:1) of small subunit to large subunit compared to hexamers (2.05:1). One isoform, XP_027232115.1, appeared to be more dominant within dodecamers than hexamers. The ability to distinguish and quantify hemocyanin isoforms within oligomeric structures will aid future studies linking hemocyanin genes to transcripts to function and physiology as well as offer insight into the evolutionary history of crustaceans.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""J.

20e00b8618ba7e521b51ebf2c2d41a0d10187b37,Association of the rs3743205 variant of DYX1C1 with dyslexia in Chinese children,"BackgroundDyslexia is a learning disability that is characterized by difficulties in the acquisition of reading and spelling skills independent of intelligence, motivation or schooling. Studies of western populations have suggested that DYX1C1 is a candidate gene for dyslexia. In view of the different languages used in Caucasian and Chinese populations, it is therefore worthwhile to investigate whether there is an association of DYX1C1 in Chinese children with dyslexia.Method and ResultsEight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped from three hundred and ninety three individuals from 131 Chinese families with two which have been reported in the literature and six tag SNPs at DYX1C1.

We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes in the PI3Â K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway may act as genetic modifiers of breast cancer DFS. We analyzed the association of 106 tagging SNPs in 13 genes (ADIPOQ, IGF1, INS, IRS1, LEP, LEPR, LEPROT, PIK3CA, PIK3R5, PTEN, TSC1, TSC2, and AKT1) in the P13K-AKT-mTOR pathway with DFS in a sample of 1,019 women with stage Iâ€“II breast cancer. SNPs significantly associated with DFS in any genetic model (additive, dominant, or recessive) after correcting for false discovery rate (FDRÂ =Â 0.10) were included in Cox proportional hazards multivariable analyses. After adjusting for race/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, tumor stage, and treatment, rs1063539 in ADIPOQ, rs11585329 in LEPR, and rs2519757 in TSC1 were associated with improved DFS, and rs1520220 in IGF1 and rs2677760 in PIK3CA were associated with worse DFS. The associations were not significantly modified by the type of systemic treatment received or body mass index. The SNPs were not associated with tumor characteristics such as tumor size, lymph node status, nuclear grade, or hormone receptor status. In this study, germline SNPs in the PI3Â K-AKT-mTOR pathway were associated with breast cancer DFS and may be potential prognostic markers. Future studies are needed to replicate our results and to evaluate the relationship between these polymorphisms and activation of the PI3Â K-AKT-mTOR pathway in breast tumors.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mala Pande"", ids = ""144382781""); list(name = ""Melissa L Bondy"", ids = ""5582196""); list(name = ""Kim-Anh Do"", ids = ""145302986""); list(name = ""Aysegul A.

d5f146a34470b1a3269dc88acf993b2daffcdaf4,Models and estimation algorithms for nonparametric finite mixtures with conditionally independent multivariate component densities,"Recently several authors have proposed models and estimation algorithms for finite nonparametric multivariate mixtures, whose identifiability is typically not obvious. Among the considered models, the assumption of independent coordinates conditional on the subpopulation from which each observation is drawn is subject of an increasing attention, in view of the theoretical and practical developments it allows, particularly with multiplicity of variables coming into play in the modern statistical framework. In this work we first consider a more general model assuming independence, conditional on the component, of multivariate blocks of coordinates instead of univariate coordinates, allowing for any dependence structure within these blocks. Consequently, the density functions of these blocks are completely multivariate and nonparametric. We present identifiability arguments and introduce for estimation in this model two methodological algorithms whose computational procedures resemble a true EM algorithm but include an additional density estimation step: a fast algorithm showing empirical efficiency without theoretical justification, and a smoothed algorithm possessing a monotony property as any EM algorithm does, but more computationally demanding. We also discuss computationally efficient methods for estimation and derive some strategies. Next, we consider a multivariate extension of the mixture models used in the framework of multiple hypothesis testings, allowing for a new multivariate version of the False Discovery Rate control. We propose a constrained version of our previous algorithm, specifically designed for this model. The behavior of the EM-type algorithms we propose is studied numerically through several Monte Carlo experiments and high dimensional real data, and compared with existing methods in the literature. Finally, the codes of our new algorithms are progressively implemented as new functions in the publicly-available package mixtools for the R statistical software.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Vy-Thuy-Lynh Hoang"", ids = ""104252480"")",,,,,
d865a89181d8eea9d3b5867ab34863337ebb3f9a,Bayesian D-optimal screening experiments with partial replication,"Screening designs are frequently used in the initial stages of experimentation with the goal of identifying important main effects as well as to gain insight on potentially important two-factor interactions. Commonly utilized experimental designs for screening are unreplicated and as such, provide no unbiased estimate of experimental error. However, if statistical inference is to be performed as part of the experimental analysis, one view is that inferential procedures should be performed using a model independent error estimate instead of the residual mean square from the fitted model. As full replication of an experiment may be quite costly, partial replication offers an alternative. Gilmour and Trinca (2012) introduce criteria for constructing optimal designs for statistical inference (and hence, provide for optimal selection of replicate design points). An extension of their work is introduced by modifying the popular Bayesian D-optimality criterion to construct partially replicated screening designs with less dependence on an assumed model. Designs are compared using various criteria and a simulation study is conducted to investigate design performance with respect to power and false discovery rates.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Robert D.

Sperm-positive females remained within their dose groups and were exposed to silver acetate during gestation and lactation. At postnatal day 26, the effect of silver ions on the developing F1 generation rat thymus was evaluated at the transcriptional level using whole-genome microarrays. Gene expression profiling analyses identified a dozen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each dose group using a loose criterion of fold change (FC) >1.5 and unadjusted pÂ <Â 0.05, regardless of whether the analysis was conducted within each gender group or with both gender groups combined. No dose-dependent effect was observed on the number of DEGs. In addition, none of these genes had a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 after correction for multiple testing. These results in combination with the observation that thymus-to-body-weight ratios were not affected and no histopathological abnormalities were identified indicate that in utero exposure to silver ions up to 26.0Â mg/kg (equivalent to 40.0Â mg/kg silver acetate) did not have an adverse effect on the developing thymus.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xiugong Gao"", ids = ""6645120""); list(name = ""Jeffrey J.

feb02f0ad2f90cf9d51863ddcec796f2b303a6a4,Longitudinal Analysis of Quantitative Brain MRI in Astronauts Following Microgravity Exposure,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Assessment of the effects of microgravity on astronauts' brains using microstructural measures by utilizing quantitative MRI, before and after spaceflight would help understand the structural changes.


METHODS
Quantitative MRI data sets in 19 astronauts were acquired before and after space missions. Both diffusion tensor metrics and volumetric measures were analyzed in the brain regions involved in the visual function.


RESULTS
The fractional anisotropy was reduced in the right posterior thalamic radiations (P = .0009) and remained significant after a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (P = .03). A trend of increase in the mean diffusivities of different subregions of the occipital cortex on the right side, including calcarine, middle occipital, inferior occipital, and fusiform gyri, was noted and became insignificant after FDR correction. Similarly, there was a trend of cortical thinning involving the right occipital lobe and bilateral fusiform gyri, volume reduction of the left thalamus, and increase in lateral ventricular volume in the postflight scans.


CONCLUSION
Gray and white matter alterations are detected by quantitative MRI before and after space flight. Our findings may be used to understand the neuroanatomical mechanisms of possible brain dysfunction or neuroplasticity in microgravity condition in the future studies.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Roy F Riascos"", ids = ""6885671""); list(name = ""Arash Kamali"", ids = ""145554892""); list(name = ""Reza Hakimelahi"", ids = ""145571227""); list(name = ""Benson Mwangi"", ids = ""145321317""); list(name = ""Pejman Rabiei"", ids = ""144113908""); list(name = ""Rachael D.

36ec7f350c1931224120d10496732f5e0318f654,Abstract 3233: The effects of electronic cigarette exposure on genome-wide expression in human bronchial epithelium,"Background: Although smoking rates continue to decline in US adults, the number of electronic cigarette (e-cig) users is rapidly growing, especially among youth. Exposure to cigarette smoke is known to result in lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is associated with inflammatory and immune responses generally, and effects gene expression related these and other pathways. However, the effects of e-cigs on the gene expression and inflammation in the bronchial epithelium are largely unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the effects of e-cig use on gene expression in the bronchial epithelium, in comparison to effects on never smokers and cigarette smokers. Methods: Epithelia brushings were obtained by bronchoscopy from never smokers (n=42), e-cig users (n=14), and current smokers (n=16) (overall, age 21-30, 78% European-American, 54% male). RNA was extracted and profiled for the whole genome transcriptome (Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0). Between group differences were determined with the t-test. False Discovery Rate (FDR) Results: The average number of cigarettes smoked per day in the smoker group was 16, ranging from 10 to 20 cigarettes/day. In the e-cig user group, the average number of puffs inhaled per day was 173, ranging from 20 to 600, and the average volume of e-liquid per day was 8 ml, ranging from 2 to 20 ml. Of the 14 e-cig users, eleven identified themselves as former smokers (average 24 months since last cigarette), while three were never-smokers. In microarray analysis, comparing never smoker and smoker groups, there were 2,536 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 1,235 up-regulated genes, 1,301 down-regulated genes in smokers) and 69 DEGs comparing never smoker and e-cig user groups (59 up-regulated genes, 10 down-regulated genes in e-cig users). In addition, there were 108 DEGs between e-cig user and smoker groups (83 up-regulated genes, 25 down-regulated genes in smokers). Several well-known smoking-related genes such as CYP1B1, AKR1B10, ALDH3A1, CYP2A13, and CX3CL1 were significantly decreased in their expression for e-cig users compared to smokers. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that the expression profiles of never smokers and e-cig users are more similar to each other compared to profiles of smokers. Pathway analysis of smoking-related genes revealed that NRF2-mediated oxidative stress was the most significant canonical pathway (P = 7.88E-11). Conclusions: Consistent with the hypothesis that e-cigs are less harmful than smoking, bronchial epithelium gene expression profiles of never smokers and e-cig users are more similar, while smokers exhibit distinct profiles. Associations of different nicotine products are apparent in gene expression profiles. Citation Format: Daniel Y. Weng, Min-Ae Song, Theodore M. Brasky, Joseph P. McElroy, Ewy Mathe, Jo L.

To identify factors related to relapse sites, we carried out an exploratory biomarker analysis of data from the Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer study, which is a randomized, controlled trial comparing postoperative adjuvant S-1 therapy with surgery alone in 1,059 patients with stage II/III gastric cancer.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Surgical specimens from 829 patients were retrospectively examined, and 63 genes involved in a variety of biological processes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression normalized to reference genes was categorized as lower or higher than the median, and association with relapse sites was analyzed based on 5-year relapse-free survival.


RESULTS
Hematogenous, lymph node, and peritoneal recurrence developed in 72, 105, and 138 of the 829 patients, respectively; hazard ratios were 0.79 (95% confidential interval: 0.54-1.16), 0.51 (0.31-0.82), and 0.60 (0.42-0.84), respectively. Expression of platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1) and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) was strongly correlated with hematogenous recurrence and peritoneal recurrence, respectively (false discovery rate = 7.7Ã—10-5 and 0.002, respectively). Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) expression was moderately correlated with lymph node recurrence (false discovery rate = 0.34). Relapse-free survival was worse in patients expressing high levels of PECAM1 (hazard ratio = 2.37, 1.65-3.41), TOP2A (hazard ratio = 2.35, 1.55-3.57), or GGH (hazard ratio = 1.87, 1.13-3.08), respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that these were stronger independent risk factors than tumor histological type.

8baca695fc20a2c90d413e17fabdabab6339c758,EEG-based connectivity in patients with partial seizures with and without generalization.,"Background and purpose
To investigate the neurophysiological basis of secondary generalization of partial epileptic seizures.


Methods
Inter-ictal, resting-state EEG functional connectivity (EEGfC) was evaluated and compared: patients with exclusively simple partial seizures (sp group) were compared to patients with simple partial and secondary generalized seizures (spsg group); patients with exclusively complex partial seizures (cp group) were compared to patients with cp and secondary generalized seizures (cpsg group); the collapsed sp+cp group (spcp) was compared to those who had exclusively secondary generalized seizures (sg group). EEGfC was computed from 21-channel waking EEG. 3 minutes of waking EEG background activity was analyzed by the LORETA Source Correlation (LSC) software. Current source density time series were computed for 23 pre-defined cortical regions (ROI) in each hemisphere, for the 1-25 Hz very narrow bands (1 Hz bandwidth). Thereafter Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between all pairs of ROI time series in the same hemisphere. Z-scored correlation coefficients were compared at the group level (t-tests and correction for multiple comparisons by local false discovery rate, FDR).


Results
Statistically significant (corrected p<0.05) EEGfC differences emerged at specific frequencies (spsg > sg; cpsg > cp), and at many frequencies (sg > spcp). The findings indicated increased coupling between motor cortices and several non-motor areas in patients with partial and sg seizures as compared to patients with partial seizures and no sg seizures. Further findings suggested increased coupling between medial parietal-occipital areas (structural core of the cortex) and lateral hemispheric areas.

Increased inter-ictal EEGfC is associated with habitual occurrence of secondary generalized seizures.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Johanna DÃ¶mÃ¶tÃ¶r"", ids = ""5267534""); list(name = ""BÃ©la Clemens"", ids = ""94103359""); list(name = ""MiklÃ³s Emri"", ids = ""2992376""); list(name = ""Szilvia PuskÃ¡s"", ids = ""46552370""); list(name = ""IstvÃ¡n Fekete"", ids = ""1945910"")",,,Ideggyogyaszati szemle,72 3-4,"

Osprey software was used to construct the interaction network of DEGs, and genes at protein-protein interaction (PPI) nodes with high degrees were identified. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and WebGestalt software were then used to perform functional annotation and pathway enrichment analyses for PPI networks, in which Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsCompared to the control samples, the expressions of 42 and 341 genes were altered in non-metastatic OS and metastatic OS samples, respectively. A total of 15 significantly enriched functions were obtained with Gene Ontology analysis (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The DEGs were classified and significantly enriched in three pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, lysosome and axon guidance.

To investigate the associations between 21 metals in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and their corresponding concentrations in urine in the general population.


METHODS
Between April and May 2011, this panel study enrolled 120 residents using random sampling approach in Wuhan communities which contained 3 035 subjects. Participants were aged 18 to 80 years and had lived in the sampling buildings for at least 5 years. Data from basic questionnaires, physical examinations, and morning blood and urine samples under fasting conditions were collected. Participants with missing data were excluded. Finally, 83 particpants included. Participants were instructed to use personal air samplers to continuously monitor PM2.5 for 24 h. The following 21 metals were measured in PM2.5 and urine by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry: aluminum, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, rubidium, strontium, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, antimony, barium, tungsten, thallium and lead. The associations between PM2.5 metals and urinary metals were investigated using generalized linear regression models.


RESULTS
The age of the study population was (51.5Â±6.3)years. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, BMI, education and income, elevated urinary chromium was significantly associated with increased chromium concentrations in personal PM2.5. The least square means (standard deviation) of urinary chromium in participants classified as having low exposure (<12.491 ng/m(3)), intermediate exposure (12.491-32.388 ng/m(3)) and high exposure (>32.388 ng/m(3)) were (-1.334Â±0.756), (-1.114Â±0.813) and (-0.718Â±0.645) Î¼g/mmol creatinine, respectively (P=0.009). However, the association between urinary and personal PM chromium was not observed after additionally adjusting for false discovery rate (P>0.05). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that other metals in PM2.5 were not related to their corresponding concentrations in urine of subjects.


CONCLUSION
Urinary concentrations of metals did not reflect human exposure to metals in air, and may not be appropriate as an index to assess personal exposure to metals in particulate matter.",2016,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yanqiu Yu"", ids = ""47112038""); list(name = ""Xiu Qin Cui"", ids = ""5821655""); list(name = ""W Feng"", ids = ""153233406""); list(name = ""Xiaotian M Zhang"", ids = ""46447100""); list(name = ""J Yuan"", ids = ""13372721""); list(name = ""Wai Hong Chen"", ids = ""50504135""); list(name = ""Tangchun Wu"", ids = ""3567607"")",,,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],50 8,"

We are seeking to identify plasma proteins, using proteomics discovery and validation approaches, to serve as proxies for micronutrient status, including selenium, which may in the future be more readily assessed by robust, affordable field methods. In a sample of rural Nepalese children 6 - 8 years old (n = 500), the prevalence of selenium deficiency was 13.6 and 60.9 % at plasma selenium concentrations < 0.60 and < 0.89 Âµmol/L, respectively, assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Relative abundance of selenoprotein P isoform 1 (SEPP1), glutathione reductase-3, and apolipoprotein A2 from discovery-based experiments was correlated with plasma selenium with a false discovery rate < 10 % (i. e., q < 0.10), all with p < 0.001. In linear mixed effects regression models to predict plasma selenium, only SEPP1 was significant (R2 = 0.63), estimating 8.2 % (95 % CI: 3.9 - 12.6) and 65.5(61.4 - 69.7)% of the in-sample population as deficient at each respective cut-off. Targeted quantification of SEPP1 in a preliminary series of specimens (n = 19) as a validation of the discovery approach revealed a high correlation with plasma selenium (r = 0.757, p = 0.0002).

Benjamini and Hochberg (J.Â R.Â Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57(1):289â€“300, 1995) provide a method for controlling the FDR based on p-values for each of the null hypotheses under the assumption that the p-values are independent. Subsequent research has since shown that this procedure is valid under weaker assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. Related procedures that are valid under no assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values have also been developed. None of these procedures, however, incorporate information about the dependence structure of the test statistics. This paper develops methods for control of the FDR under weak assumptions that incorporate such information and, by doing so, are better able to detect false null hypotheses. We illustrate this property via a simulation study and two empirical applications.

Bonferroni correction and False Discovery Rate (FDR) can effectively control type I error but often yield a high false negative rate. We aim to develop a more powerful method to detect differentially expressed genes. We present a Weighted False Discovery Rate (WFDR) method that incorporate biological knowledge from genetic networks. We first identify weights using Integrative Multi-species Prediction (IMP) and then apply the weights in WFDR to identify differentially expressed genes through an IMP-WFDR algorithm. We performed a gene expression experiment to identify zebrafish genes that change expression in the presence of arsenic during a systemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Zebrafish were exposed to arsenic at 10 parts per billion and/or infected with P. aeruginosa. Appropriate controls were included. We then applied IMP-WFDR during the analysis of differentially expressed genes. We compared the mRNA expression for each group and found over 200 differentially expressed genes and several enriched pathways including defense response pathways, arsenic response pathways, and the Notch signaling pathway.",2014,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jiang Gui"", ids = ""50114098""); list(name = ""Casey S.

Research Design and Methods: We compared fasting serum from an oral glucose-tolerance test at ~28 weeksâ€™ gestation from 67 Northern European ancestry mothers from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study with high (>90 percentile) FPG to 50 mothers with low (<10 percentile) FPG but comparable BMI. Metabolic data from biochemical analyses of conventional clinical metabolites, targeted mass-spectrometry (MS)-based measurement of amino acids, and non-targeted gas chromatography/MS were subjected to permetabolite analyses and collective pathway analyses using Unipathway annotation. Results: High FPG mothers had a metabolic profile consistent with insulin resistance including higher triglycerides, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and amino acids including alanine, proline and branched chain amino acids (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p<0.05). Lower 1,5-anhydroglucitol in high FPG mothers suggested recent hyperglycemic excursions (FDR-adjusted p<0.05). Pathway analyses indicated differences in amino acid degradation pathways for the two groups (FDRadjusted p<0.05), consistent with population-based findings in non-pregnant populations. Exploratory analyses with newborn outcomes indicated positive associations for maternal triglycerides with neonatal sum of skinfolds and cord C-peptide and a negative association between maternal glycine and cord C-peptide (p<0.05). Conclusions: Metabolomics reveals perturbations in metabolism of major macronutrients and amino acid degradation pathways in high vs. low FPG mothers.

Our study aimed to characterize the dysbiosis signatures of gut microbiota in coronary artery disease. The gut microbiota represented in stool samples were collected from 70 patients with coronary artery disease and 98 healthy controls. 16S rRNA sequencing was applied, and bioinformatics methods were used to decipher taxon signatures and function alteration, as well as the microbial network and diagnostic model of gut microbiota in coronary artery disease. Gut microbiota showed decreased diversity and richness in patients with coronary artery disease. The composition of the microbial community changed; Escherichia-Shigella [false discovery rate (FDRâ€‰=â€‰7.5*10-5] and Enterococcus (FDRâ€‰=â€‰2.08*10-7) were significant enriched, while Faecalibacterium (FDRâ€‰=â€‰6.19*10-10), Subdoligranulum (FDRâ€‰=â€‰1.63*10-6), Roseburia (FDRâ€‰=â€‰1.95*10-9), and Eubacterium rectale (FDRâ€‰=â€‰2.35*10-4) were significant depleted in the CAD group. Consistent with the taxon changes, functions such as amino acid metabolism, phosphotransferase system, propanoate metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and protein and tryptophan metabolism were found to be enhanced in CAD patients. The microbial network revealed that Faecalibacterium and Escherichia-Shigella were the microbiotas that dominated in the healthy control and CAD groups, respectively. The microbial diagnostic model based on random forest also showed probability in identifying those who suffered from CAD. Our study successfully identifies the dysbiosis signature, dysfunctions, and comprehensive networks of gut microbiota in CAD patients. Thus, modulation targeting the gut microbiota may be a novel strategy for CAD treatment.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qi Ji Zhu"", ids = ""47713520""); list(name = ""Renyuan Gao"", ids = ""3714634""); list(name = ""Yi Zhang"", ids = ""49891172""); list(name = ""Dengdeng Pan"", ids = ""51254783""); list(name = ""Yefei Zhu"", ids = ""49780789""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Zhang"", ids = ""51237608""); list(name = ""Rong Yang"", ids = ""46781370""); list(name = ""Rong Jiang"", ids = ""145167111""); list(name = ""Yawei Xu"", ids = ""144794633""); list(name = ""Huanlong Qin"", ids = ""82478164"")",bcbde565a695282e193e48ade73e94c912e7dc69; 0083fbd819d3b439b2a0cbb156f496d6420e3d94; ef9b7695bc1335303dbf684681ac37a467c4972b; e5c24d67d9f2b8064d20db39418e11e5f64d599d,,Physiological genomics,50 10,"

Understanding the pathogenesis in the early stages of late-onset AD can help gain important mechanistic insights into this disease as well as aid in effe ctive drug development. The a nalysis of incipient AD is steeped in diffic ulties due to its slight pathological and genetic diffe rences from normal ageing. The d iffic ulty also lies in the choice of analysis techniques as statistical power to analyse incipient AD with a small sample size, as is common in pilot studies, can be low if the proper analytical tool is not employed. In this study, we propose the use of a new method of significa nt genes selection, multiple linear regression, which uses the cognitive index (MiniMental Status Examination (MMSE)) and pathological characteristic (neurofi brillary tangles (NFT)), along with gene expression profi les, to select genes.

b046651a5fc318c793feaa0fae6d040191dc550f,Milk-borne Bioactive Factors: Effects on Neonatal Porcine Reproductive Tissues,"Milk-borne factors delivered to nursing offspring via a lactocrine mechanism affect development of somatic tissues, including the uterus. Gene expression events associated with porcine endometrial maturation between birth (postnatal day = PND 0) and PND 2 can determine and may define the uterine developmental program. Lactocrine-sensitive elements of the neonatal porcine uterine transcriptome have not been defined during this period. Therefore, the objective here was to determine effects of imposition of the lactocrine-null condition for 48 h from birth on the porcine uterine transcriptome at PND 2 using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Gilts (n = 4/group) were assigned at birth to be: (1) nursed ad libitum, or (2) gavage-fed (30 ml/kg BW/2h) commercial porcine milk-replacer for 48 h. Uteri were obtained at 50 h. Total uterine RNA was extracted and both concentration and integrity were determined. For each uterus, 500 ng of RNA was used for cDNA library preparation. Libraries were sequenced (paired end) at > 90 million reads per sample. After demultiplexing, raw reads were mapped to the latest pig Sscrofa10.2 build using Avadis NGS software. Validation compared RNAseq results to those obtained for targeted genes using quantitative RT-PCR. Gene enrichment and functional analyses were conducted. On PND 2, 896 genes were differentially expressed (P < 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate) in nursed as compared to milk replacer-fed gilts.

This study was conducted to determine whether miRNAs are differentially expressed in the human myometrium during spontaneous parturition. STUDY DESIGN: Myometrial biopsies were obtained at the time of cesarean delivery from women not in labor and those in early labor (cervical dilatation !5 cm). We studied the relative expression levels of 157 miRNAs using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations and the false discovery rate correction method. P values are displayed in the Figure.

78d856a38f335f00f055e30bbd9f135e232e0add,False discovery rate control for non-positively regression dependent test statistics,"In this paper we present a modification of the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure for testing non-positive dependent test statistics. The new testing procedure makes use of the same series of linearly increasing critical values. Yet, in the new procedure the set of p-values is divided into subsets of positively dependent p-values, and each subset of p-values is separately sorted and compared to the series of critical values. In the first part of the paper we introduce the new testing methodology, discuss the technical issues needed to apply the new approach, and apply it to data from a genetic experiment. In the second part of the paper we discuss pairwise comparisons. We introduce FDR controlling procedures for testing pairwise comparisons.We apply these procedures to an example extensively studied in the statistical literature, and to test pairwise comparisons in gene expression data. We also use the new testing procedure to prove that the Simes procedure can, in some cases, be used to test all pairwise comparisons. The control over the FDR has proven to be a successful alternative to control over the family wise error rate in the analysis of large data sets; the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure has also made the application of the Simes procedure to test the complete null hypothesis unnecessary. Our main message in this paper is that a more conservative approach may be needed for testing nonpositively dependent test statistics: apply the Simes procedure to test the complete null hypothesis; if the complete null hypothesis is rejected apply the new testing approach to determine which of the null hypotheses are false. It will probably yield less discoveries, however it ensures control over the FDR.

7502b4867587e8877375fd2d66af4a16b44547b5,Shrinkage Estimation of Expression Fold Change As an Alternative to Testing Hypotheses of Equivalent Expression,"Research on analyzing microarray data has focused on the problem of identifying differentially expressed genes to the neglect of the problem of how to integrate evidence that a gene is differentially expressed with information on the extent of its differential expression. Consequently, researchers currently prioritize genes for further study either on the basis of volcano plots or, more commonly, according to simple estimates of the fold change after filtering the genes with an arbitrary statistical significance threshold. While the subjective and informal nature of the former practice precludes quantification of its reliability, the latter practice is equivalent to using a hard-threshold estimator of the expression ratio that is not known to perform well in terms of mean-squared error, the sum of estimator variance and squared estimator bias. On the basis of two distinct simulation studies and data from different microarray studies, we systematically compared the performance of several estimators representing both current practice and shrinkage. We find that the threshold-based estimators usually perform worse than the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) and they often perform far worse as quantified by estimated mean-squared risk. By contrast, the shrinkage estimators tend to perform as well as or better than the MLE and never much worse than the MLE, as expected from what is known about shrinkage. However, a Bayesian measure of performance based on the prior information that few genes are differentially expressed indicates that hard-threshold estimators perform about as well as the local false discovery rate (FDR), the best of the shrinkage estimators studied. Based on the ability of the latter to leverage information across genes, we conclude that the use of the local-FDR estimator of the fold change instead of informal or threshold-based combinations of statistical tests and non-shrinkage estimators can be expected to substantially improve the reliability of gene prioritization at very little risk of doing so less reliably.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zahra Montazeri"", ids = ""3133707""); list(name = ""Corey M.

784062ba80e8b4e22114f293a839d8d4c6dacc1e,RNA profiling of human testicular cells identifies syntenic lncRNAs associated with spermatogenesis.,"STUDY QUESTION
Is the noncoding transcriptional landscape during spermatogenesis conserved between human and rodents?


SUMMARY ANSWER
We identified a core group of 113 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 20 novel genes dynamically and syntenically transcribed during spermatogenesis.


WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY
Spermatogenesis is a complex differentiation process driven by a tightly regulated and highly specific gene expression program. Recently, several studies in various species have established that a large proportion of known lncRNAs are preferentially expressed during meiosis and spermiogenesis in a testis-specific manner.


STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION
To further investigate lncRNA expression in human spermatogenesis, we carried out a cross-species RNA profiling study using isolated testicular cells.


PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS
Human testes were obtained from post-mortem donors (Nâ€‰=â€‰8, 51 years old on average) or from prostate cancer patients with no hormonal treatment (Nâ€‰=â€‰9, 80 years old on average) and only patients with full spermatogenesis were used to prepare enriched populations of spermatocytes, spermatids, Leydig cells, peritubular cells and Sertoli cells. To minimize potential biases linked to inter-patient variations, RNAs from two or three donors were pooled prior to RNA-sequencing (paired-end, strand-specific). Resulting reads were mapped to the human genome, allowing for assembly and quantification of corresponding transcripts.


MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Our RNA-sequencing analysis of pools of isolated human testicular cells enabled us to reconstruct over 25â€‰000 transcripts. Among them we identified thousands of lncRNAs, as well as many previously unidentified genes (novel unannotated transcripts) that share many properties of lncRNAs. Of note is that although noncoding genes showed much lower synteny than protein-coding ones, a significant fraction of syntenic lncRNAs displayed conserved expression during spermatogenesis.


LARGE SCALE DATA
Raw data files (fastq) and a searchable table (.xlss) containing information on genomic features and expression data for all refined transcripts have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE74896.


LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION
Isolation procedures may alter the physiological state of testicular cells, especially for somatic cells, leading to substantial changes at the transcriptome level. We therefore cross-validated our findings with three previously published transcriptomic analyses of human spermatogenesis. Despite the use of stringent filtration criteria, i.e. expression cut-off of at least three fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped, fold-change of at least three and false discovery rate adjusted P-values of less than <1%, the possibility of assembly artifacts and false-positive transcripts cannot be fully ruled out.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS
For the first time, this study has led to the identification of a large number of conserved germline-associated lncRNAs that are potentially important for spermatogenesis and sexual reproduction. In addition to further substantiating the basis of the human testicular physiology, our study provides new candidate genes for male infertility of genetic origin. This is likely to be relevant for identifying interesting diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and also potential novel therapeutic targets for male contraception.

We derive an approximation for the multiple family FDR for independently distributed test statistics: q, the level at which the BH procedure is applied, times the number of families tested plus the number of discoveries, divided by the number of discoveries plus 1. We provide a universal bound for the FDR of the discoveries in the new hierarchical testing approach, 2 Ã— 1.44 Ã— q, and demonstrate in simulations that when the data has an hierarchical structure the new testing approach can be considerably more powerful than the BH procedure.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Daniel Yekutieli"", ids = ""2398627"")",5a7dd9fe429162249610e4f86bdcf06f9e3abea9; 2b4c34a2d15343fe4cf096039606c3a5359403c8; 7e504bfb29d24a97e374b90c0f9ce4bdf1bcc68b; 9e130b2c4bc2e1256f558f25dcb9c2fe53b6e08f; c117971e646e96ba2577f8a7f39246f021e08544; 65088aea57ef71119bbfcc2b2b320dea8484e878; c7f04d7274e50c34e8c942478370c2f68a3da81c; 877d1285540d9f5fbd752d1f40a04cfcd8f380ed; 840852945b8d1f6d04e8942faa20bdeaf555e909; 37c21a0937505d63a844204050455948b84c8a6a; 0d89ab20bcb4d9a2efbb4419ac69653d1d86ebd5; d541cad730d918ba005e9afd07d166f11746ed57; 4714548b587f976640e0ef4eefe0e974f28988c0; e3159d253d3dc7497604a54f1a907afddbae2fee; 42b0123349cba9c537aeb0616333264414b986e6; 4060fcc520700ea600ca82f37f1492bf2fcaa557; b010cd79cc49f9dc60b003830d54d93e6d135e68; 7615e498c3ea26705f6440db1a1bb1a77477219b; e67bcbbd1eec1eeea9827d802ee1b64753d31c95; 28b910931f8d5c4a24b96b543e2f8b02b347dc40; 47e0eca9f722167c3ec1e9f0ad5d48c81e83d1f8; c08892e8637c6a1ff498eb1e640b388adf8a9d39; 40eb9c52649f75b1cfc9b55787d5e58ff9bcf98e; 50b2f28ebfcf7bbad6141ed3c82a0a3b632967ed; 651b903448090dc22c812f9c5154bba389f49286; d68fdcd96cc4b9414d57a3f7217595490daf484b; 79d096e7a00d73ce2fbc134273c6b8abfe51f2ee; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; cd91d4e320287f992e620b4bbf3527293cffb363; 58758ec70f6f4a9586a4e659fe427578b14f7729; 35aaa29d5bac7d9bd55be0a955d180422b6a9c33; 0baa7d9071f95ca44e1945c70824b6a9ba8197fb; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; 034873c57886a951bbf659261b6f3af25e7ba46b; a16c84b7caf609ad64edf696e5bf684815bc6891; 9dbb0d0fbceb3174aef95cd87d55270f5dd01444; c9b3cbe5c5e1b6914e7ff0dfd1b632126d24b984; 0df55032b324524d66f31fd58dd0cfe96b483114; a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c; 0f4ff4f1b6d60b754cda6eb9b082d83c1bf8831a; e98a72af3262783f321c7f4cec062f97def980b2; d78be1d2ce316dbce633190996c721d17ca428d3; 15b4192d8024b0ef6db4d82ae131289e6e36b701; 20f727da24964f488dff567b99f3d2018a79bdf1; ad817da5a0cbfa09b5b37dda62b8d16eda679dc0; efc586f11651c1d329339b3cda2d02fa981cda30; a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78; 96e6dc481ba777f16fd86b3649ea803322690478; bf06b80f4df8c2afdad13ee9fbc258c4845bcdf7; 39ea2aa3e28411a215429b5c50f697fdfe928fc1; fa7efad78276094533299a94eaaad7d53fd061b7; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; e2cb9bbeea561c0050c1811c5dab12986dbd24c3; ace745ec27b3fee7b107654de6f6695e30ebb76b; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; df30e5fef6177bb4ab9527270fdc64ee908858b1; a6aa364e54930c796cc85ca0ccbc3019081f952d; 26d8f323e8a1318f0ae765a227a99be5ac61d61d; a8388b0845bab1fd839d3a35c2371d6e50126ce4; 2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59; d08b546b72428b3ad761b7c976eea2a55d54f389; daa3843cc25edbeb696a639108ae31f03afc3c86; 2aa5df22b25edfdf938c11177b36038c825bf391; 021f576fb32c03ec2266111353f8c89e3d3c01d2; c93060355830534d0c146fbd3005e7391406aaad; 3b6f86c18c2ac927332200acc56d0691ae2b5afe; b4797ba1324a13099f7647fc8a113bee7a0aa8ce; ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877; 523c45dd2276dabb7ed1f5b3ab664da70f7c1afd; 718e649459135b9482943bd6c636fbe3109a0d5a; 2704db65f5396b65ea4796ef0a14f98603442675; 48e8dba37c370d5eb026d064867a9cb2922e70d6; 9b5317b8af3b041330fbe506dd25a2ba4e6b3cda; 40f4c6d4dcee6eb1365120e9165bddc08c2c13af; 567b1261cbe581695aa43e815892a435f74fd8e7; 5043fd247ee67d229bfb656264d634abc44518f7; 09feb1abfad9482a0df7a99a0d08dd0a34e56031,4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 60ca0e6986b4c52cd9ee2495bb644d8a7eb24fd8; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; f462cabdd77694e43359c9d5ac0e8660dcd5afbf; 28087496d717dbb708af1bccc165ff6e60a68f70; 2203c20aaefc87c72e494b45dc77ed10f3013cb5; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 632d948109728efbc57e45c6036c458644de26d3; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 6c02d3c3a9dd9e38764ce51d9b7f5e0ade22b598; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 702773e40133afd0f967edd333f36f51ace23f6c; 9e120a37498b1a454b935c53aae1a3bf03043a24; 1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e78994431e72d3d1d64723fd05dcb2524cb8f873,Journal of the American Statistical Association,103,309-316
776e58e49e8f65f3260088643de30dc12285d0fe,Bioinformatics Analysis in Differences of RNA Expression in the Tendon According to Anatomic Outcomes in Rotator Cuff Repair: Letter to the Editor,"Dear Editor: We read with great interest the recent report by Ahn et al, â€˜â€˜Differences of RNA Expression in the Tendon According to Anatomic Outcomes in Rotator Cuff Repair,â€™â€™ which appeared in the June 2017 issue of The American Journal of Sports Medicine. The results of the report are very helpful for us; however, from our perspective, the authorsâ€™ methods in bioinformatics analysis are inappropriate. We noticed that the authors used Student t tests for detecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healed and unhealed groups. Actually, due to the high false-positive rate caused by a huge number of probes and multiple comparisons, it is fundamental to analyze microarray data properly to reach a reliable result by a rational statistical method, but the Student t test is not affected by heterogeneity in variance across genes because it considers information from only 1 gene. Obviously, the Student t test is not stable or suitable for high-level microarray analysis. But, if the Student t test is used for DEG analysis in the microarray, setting an adjusted P \ .05 with multiple testing corrections according to the Benjamini-Hochberg method as the cutoff is a reasonable method. In addition, we recommend using specialized high-level microarray analysis, limma (Linear Models for Microarray Analysis), a commonly used statistical test to analyze differential expression package by using linear models. Further, choosing more than 1.5-fold expression changes and false discovery rate (FDR) \0.05 as the cutoff is an appropriate and conservative approach to obtain DEGs. Moreover, Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) is also a nonparametric statistical algorithm to consider, and 2-fold expression change and q \ 0.1 are rational cutoffs to obtain DEGs. Above all, although the authors performed extra analysis for a portion of DEGs in order to verify the results of the microarray, it is impractical when using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other technology to verify all DEGs. Choosing the proper statistical method and obtaining more accurate and convincing results of DEG analysis form the basis for further analyses such as gene ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis.

Methods: The following were conducted in an adult Han Chinese population from southern China: case-control association analyses of 30 representative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were screened according to specific programs based on bioinformatics tools and former research and quantitative trait locus analyses with SNPs and psychiatric symptoms evaluated with the positive and negative symptoms scale. Results: A 4-SNP haplotype consisting of rs362814, rs39339, rs540058, and rs661575 was found to be significantly associated with SZ even after Bonferroni correction (Ï‡2 = 29.024, p = 6.42E-04, p Bonf = 0.017), and the T-C-T-C haplotype was a protective factor for SZ (OR = 0.050, 95% CI = 0.004-0.705). Moreover, the 4-SNP haplotype showed a significant association with G16 (active social avoidance) after false discovery rate correction (Ï‡2 = 28.620, p = 1.697E-04, p FDR = 0.025). In addition, P7 (hostility) was related to the haplotype comprising rs2229864, rs2535764, and rs262355 (Ï‡2 = 31.424, p = 2.103E-05, p adjustment = 0.019) in quantitative trait loci analyses. Conclusion: Overall, this study showed several positive associations between RELN and SZ, as well as psychiatric symptoms, which not only supports the proposition that RELN is a susceptibility gene for SZ but also provides information on a genotype-phenotype correlation for SZ in a Chinese population.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xia Luo"", ids = ""49634020""); list(name = ""Si Chen"", ids = ""47336662""); list(name = ""Li Xue"", ids = ""49449011""); list(name = ""Jian-Huan Chen"", ids = ""50763322""); list(name = ""Yan-wei Shi"", ids = ""48081154""); list(name = ""Hu Zhao"", ids = ""46430841"")",b925864b54f6d9fc207e0095a76bc2f92a917158; 82961d7a38affd17a16d3fecb57b79ba2d0cbcd8; b9182d4d07024594e353b0faa64d6c3ee5b34310; 8f1a3b07180ceb4b8987e896877350e33827f37c,1738794f9ad4f470b1898f166341922584f56477; 3e7b2baaab9aa27fe71daef0b57493b33d0982b5; a5760558fb8e0cd6097dafe3e50709bddcdeca4b; e2bae43502944441066432707e1395e89aa4f49c; e46763b93ffbb71d05e9621a9e3053e1b0d1f400; 930a941ff6985f62788181460eebdd0772b24637; 2deace5ac8d803887884f15ad635e1a0fbe4ebf2; 23e8498a8a270a6385c0c81fb38c60e8a0f7a261; 67d26bb250f0b6cf64b446fcb099759dcae34d14; fadb00a0e78a528225e084f337460419b7584256; 2f90f0ec783675427ef4cd71caaf497eca532b74; 973d26f09e79c85d31c5d616c6ef1aa1c8749a16; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; ff45f2b25ad6009500ad2025c3b9640b3579d33b; 50dcd788a32cdbf38d3f8a99393d548cbb829067; 04e94a74f3ab256050d6af5c13f1c050b5789b7a; 1b1ad6cb63c62bf8abaf43edbca732c80f550db8; 1c1cb27c2512f7263c622865f534a66b630bc6de; 3ea6253b424ab3dfb5ca72030fa631d48380f52f; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; 0a3919c8f98eea0fdf7d70480de7459b1ae7cb02; 32f1a059fdb2776660b9e5294f6a54677af84fa1; e18c9589a6c75a1987b3efc970336c4478a29602; 3a492e30cc666e3318b4da360203b3c0a2932ce0; 45e2d1022b55c2f7e58f044b0c8bf6137ad6d397; 63462a81212c600587803921659f30b5b6e727ee; 71b166944faf844cfc529d6d9712fc2d7c3152b5; 768b97bd5a8d4944be4a6f71b12ffad372a6ce5e; fc0f006d4bdc0f0a9519fb37afa2029a6497e969; f995e0be49ba43b6d3324af2ee00c6a3be84d210; c3737daa63d045014fa0fcebd542cf26ad82ca6f; 98bd502cd35b93c032e514afeec90f602cddb5a8; e950fab0dbc16d7669b16b8d3a9ba2f678f0359a; a7c3e3fda30aec943f34c4862ce7e51bf5e5a453; d0652660369b93690aabca2b38352bb7578cffac; 90f8350a67cf3ac3d6cff5bd795176595a748c64; 579080ee4d89a84f15d9792a12982bdd03403941; 8365b08b436ea2e44334f0f51e86844e64721774; 8b5adaf75b5425d1fe64d4ebd0dba10eeb39ab44; 9912feb4831cb16e406cb1bdb74e61bc572436d3; cd3c02b4a235b5731e52918a36d3d760d140b7b4; f09daaa9066542bc9236f9e42db6102daa5b4334; 2b4296e22e1bc42829e24bd06a5fc94f1989bdda; 949c2c822b7c1db1134ccb687ee14674a7252f5b; e6521eba8e83a2e34edc8298d474c4ab1bd3b2ec; c15940ab1571e952e80e84ad26fa8f674f883b58; 531b4f1b32a32a8f193f4b1cea77556048fe50b3; 92c85cacb697482a3bf6b6ea6cf5c7b36d8d9df1; 6d1cf0f0282342b6eea54bbfa18dc1b768f9c2d5; 0afc8fb7510731369cef2bcf337f3ea035600283; 6d623e92030a13dbd87ad6e99dc83b1e773f4320; bb77df5fa2e7e726a04c4731af2807110dd6510b; 41120d16cb9eac9481568bb85834cf9eb62822c8,Frontiers in Genetics,10,
4555c6b64b25dc92a32af78d90079ea1ae183f28,Robust distances for outlier-free goodness-of-fit testing,"Robust distances are mainly used for the purpose of detecting multivariate outliers. The precise definition of cut-off values for formal outlier testing assumes that the ''good'' part of the data comes from a multivariate normal population. Robust distances also provide valuable information on the units not declared to be outliers and, under mild regularity conditions, they can be used to test the postulated hypothesis of multivariate normality of the uncontaminated data. This approach is not influenced by nasty outliers and thus provides a robust alternative to classical tests for multivariate normality relying on Mahalanobis distances. One major advantage of the suggested procedure is that it takes into account the effect induced by trimming of outliers in several ways. First, it is shown that stochastic trimming is an important ingredient for the purpose of obtaining a reliable estimate of the number of ''good'' observations. Second, trimming must be allowed for in the empirical distribution of the robust distances when comparing them to their nominal distribution. Finally, alternative trimming rules can be exploited by controlling alternative error rates, such as the False Discovery Rate. Numerical evidence based on simulated and real data shows that the proposed method performs well in a variety of situations of practical interest.

771f05f9ec2d5d90e4afd9835f4fb987d45db52f,Relationship between gene expression and lung function in Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias,"BackgroundIdiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) are a group of heterogeneous, somewhat unpredictable diseases characterized by progressive scarring of the interstitium. Since lung function is a key determinant of survival, we reasoned that the transcriptional profile in IIP lung tissue would be associated with measures of lung function, and could enhance prognostic approaches to IIPs.ResultsUsing gene expression profiling of 167 lung tissue specimens with IIP diagnosis and 50 control lungs, we identified genes whose expression is associated with changes in lung function (% predicted FVC and % predicted DLCO) modeled as categorical (severe vs mild disease) or continuous variables while adjusting for smoking status and IIP subtype; false discovery rate (FDR) approach was used to correct for multiple comparisons. This analysis identified 58 transcripts that are associated with mild vs severe disease (categorical analysis), including those with established role in fibrosis (ADAMTS4, ADAMTS9, AGER, HIF-1Î±, SERPINA3, SERPINE2, and SELE) as well as novel IIP candidate genes such as rhotekin 2 (RTKN2) and peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15). Protein-protein interactome analysis of 553 genes whose expression is significantly associated with lung function when modeled as continuous variables demonstrates that more severe presentation of IIPs is characterized by an increase in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, increased hypoxia, and dampened innate immune response. Our findings were validated in an independent cohort of 131 IIPs and 40 controls at the mRNA level and for one gene (RTKN2) at the protein level by immunohistochemistry in a subset of samples.ConclusionsWe identified commonalities and differences in gene expression among different subtypes of IIPs. Disease progression, as characterized by lower measures of FVC and DLCO, results in marked changes in expression of novel and established genes and pathways involved in IIPs. These genes and pathways represent strong candidates for biomarker studies and potential therapeutic targets for IIP severity.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark P.

Recently novel multiplex assays have been used in an attempt to overcome limitations in numbers of available targets studied in a single experiment. Other technical challenges in developing pre-clinical rodent models to investigate biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) include relatively small volumes of sample and low concentrations of target proteins. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the inflammatory profile present in CSF at a subacute time point in a clinically relevant rodent model of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Our other aim was to test a microarray proteomics platform specifically for this application.MethodsA 34 cytokine sandwich ELISA microarray was used to study inflammatory changes in CSF samples taken 12 days post-cervical SCI in adult rats. The difference between the median foreground signal and the median background signal was measured. Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochburg multiple testing corrections were applied to limit the False Discovery Rate (FDR), and a linear mixed model was used to account for repeated measures in the array.ResultsWe report a novel subacute SCI biomarker, elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-8 protein in CSF, and discuss application of statistical models designed for multiplex testing.ConclusionsMajor advantages of this assay over conventional methods include high-throughput format, good sensitivity, and reduced sample consumption. This method can be useful for creating comprehensive inflammatory profiles, and biomarkers can be used in the clinic to assess injury severity and to objectively grade response to therapy.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew A.

7594f9b2069a0f704d9922be8babc6217ff304d3,Circulating tumor cell detection and transcriptomic profiles in early breast cancer patients.,"In the early 2000s, studies using high-throughput transcriptomic analyses revealed different aspects of breast cancer biology. Several outcome-based predictors and biologybased classifiers have been proposed: invasiveness gene signature (IGS), intrinsic molecular subtype, wound-response signature, etc. Recently, circulating tumor cell (CTC) cytological detection has been associated with metastasis-free and overall survival in the REMAGUS02 neoadjuvant trial [1]. In this article, we report, for the first time, the transcriptomic analysis of 60 nonmetastatic breast cancers according to CTC detection. The REMAGUS02 trial included breast cancer patients with locally advanced or large breast cancer. CTC detection was carried out at baseline and at the end of chemotherapy using the CellSearch system (Veridex, Raritan, NJ). Total RNA extracted from the pretreatment cancer biopsy was hybridized on the GeneChip Human Genome U1331 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Conditions of the sampling procedures and RNA quality control are detailed elsewhere [2]. The genechip robust multi-array average procedure [3] was used to normalize the gene expression data. A hierarchical clustering was then carried out using the 10 000 probe sets that showed the highest values in the interquartile range (IQR). We applied the intrinsic gene set on the complete dataset of 60 samples to define the molecular subtypes and the IGS. We used the defined and validated centroids of 306 genes to discriminate between previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. We matched the probe list UniGene ID (Build#204) to the GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array, resulting in a list of 294 unique probe sets. Each sample was assigned to the nearest subtype/centroid as determined by the highest Spearman rank order correlation between the gene expression values of the 294 probe sets and the 5 subtype centroids. The IGS score was determined by calculating the Pearson correlation between the probe set expression values of each sample and the 110 reference expression levels of the same genes defining the IGS signature. Single probe set analyses were carried out using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Finally, because half of the probe sets showed the highest IQR values, a significance analysis of microarray (SAM) was proposed to detect differentially associated genes (DEG) between CTCpositive and -negative patients. At first, unsupervised clustering revealed three major tumor clusters; they unsurprisingly corresponded to triplenegative, human epithelial growth factor receptor 2(HER2)positive/estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, and ER-positive breast cancer immunohistological phenotypes. CTC detection was not statistically different among these three clusters (Figure 1). Breast cancers were then classified according to selected biology-based signatures: the intrinsic subtype classifier and IGS, which is stemness related. CTC detection was not statistically different among subgroups: basal, n = 6/18 (33%); HER2, n = 3/10 (33%); luminal A, n = 2/15 (13%); luminal B, n = 2/10 (20%); normal like, n = 2/7 (29%); low-risk IGS, n = 9/27 (33%); and high-risk IGS, n = 6/33 (18%). Single probe set analyses were then carried out on candidate genes that are directly involved in CTC detection by the CellSearch system (cytokeratin 8, 18, 19, and EpCAM) or that are surrogate markers for breast cancer stem cells (CD24, CD44, ALDH1A1): messenger RNA levels were not correlated with CTC positivity. In addition, at the high false discovery rate of 30%, only 18 DEG were found using a SAM procedure. This is the first study, to date, to correlate CTC detection in nonmetastatic breast cancer with the gene expression profile of the primary tumor.

64e0f6ee642ddd807e1cf8a32c6dce91b9d60332,Semi-Parametric Differential Expression Analysis via Partial Mixture Estimation,"We develop an approach for microarray differential expression analysis, i.e. identifying genes whose expression levels differ between two or more groups. Current approaches to inference rely either on full parametric assumptions or on permutation-based techniques for sampling under the null distribution. In some situations, however, a full parametric model cannot be justified, or the sample size per group is too small for permutation methods to be valid.We propose a semi-parametric framework based on partial mixture estimation which only requires a parametric assumption for the null (equally expressed) distribution and can handle small sample sizes where permutation methods break down. We develop two novel improvements of Scott's minimum integrated square error criterion for partial mixture estimation [Scott, 2004a,b]. As a side benefit, we obtain interpretable and closed-form estimates for the proportion of EE genes. Pseudo-Bayesian and frequentist procedures for controlling the false discovery rate are given.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether SNPs, previously reported in association with sleep-related phenotypes, are associated with individual symptoms of insomnia.MethodsWe selected participants from the HUNT study (Norway) who reported at least one symptom of insomnia consisting of sleep onset, maintenance or early morning awakening difficulties, (cases, Nâ€‰=â€‰2563) compared to participants who presented no symptoms at all (controls, Nâ€‰=â€‰3665). Cases were further divided in seven subgroups according to different combinations of these three symptoms. We used multinomial logistic regressions to test the association among different patterns of symptoms and 59 SNPs identified in past GWAS studies.ResultsAlthough 16 SNPS were significantly associated (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) with at least one symptom subgroup, none of the investigated SNPs remained significant after correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method.ConclusionsSNPs associated with sleep-related traits do not replicate on any pattern of insomnia symptoms after multiple tests correction. However, correction in this case may be overly conservative.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniela Bragantini"", ids = ""78289975""); list(name = ""BÃ¸rge Sivertsen"", ids = ""144512388""); list(name = ""Philip R Gehrman"", ids = ""4929348""); list(name = ""Stian Lydersen"", ids = ""2128759""); list(name = ""Ismail CÃ¼neyt GÃ¼zey"", ids = ""8101695"")",,513f348b5a41d151f1bac46a56078af09deb1078; 9f94cf5238a4d197e09ff0484e18fc92d9a63320; 06d1d5fb969031f08fd4941638684b472ba811b4; 6ca89f20c1bef0740b806b5fc255ac9b475fefb7; 36014443781aa8d0094cebd794fa8fe0396694b9; d98a776d943130ffaa6436cd72e1ce74c66440c1; a670c44b7f7794dd2eb1fb67583dc37c7e54a5b7; 5a608ca866b9d5d63b9d7e4a5d6276c2cb9ace4c; 8ca3f68788c8e437e898a684bc49c9ef380fe90c; 23d498bff14ab59eee0cc8b35db89bb095303d3a; edbaf331f531af302f38528f2076bd6f501c9c04; 9c8a375b7966f00e66ffbd7dfacc96767ba23b9b; 143a6cc28356ef140f11e2855c163e8cfa23cdcb; cd4df490c4403a5d8ba32ef99ef2a39e884f71dd; e01d1e942eb15e1c9b883ffc52cf2e55b3e6dc5b; 4b86f44e266d7b59cf8a0bc92d9daaf32a7e2963; b59e6e14ebb95a8e882f7d5af033a832fa62f692; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 285083f2f7e7ffd6ff94d5fc3213fd5f55c8aaf4; 5dbb51d55a33bf3cf527b76db9c9d2c6051fd2dd; d0d842826a6dc53a0abfa7f3c05cee48c13f590b; 7b734a06fd3acf2b06af0347da6be3688d9788fc; b84f72af8069270de295f37612d748a2d90e4fa9; 4792e70ab14fcabf2eb3038536e9fe6cdb29c445; 2a5b83e299cde9b938880a0f4f4fa255ae0d3da2; 947feba9136e877f50968b62fd2e6c6381376580; 9c5b31db25d2261c8c9bcbe427c446a8c9276b96; 360a8f6fbb4c6915417be8b089e352b31554e3d4; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; 47f3425de440fa5e2052d386eca32746ea477fd3,BMC Medical Genetics,20,

While this is well known, the downstream consequences of misalignment have not been fully characterized.  We assessed the potential for incorrect alignment of RNA-sequencing reads to cause false positives in both gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and co-expression analyses. Trans-eQTLs identified from human RNA-sequencing studies appeared to be particularly affected by this phenomenon, even when only uniquely aligned reads are considered. Over 75% of trans-eQTLs using a standard pipeline occurred between regions of sequence similarity and therefore could be due to alignment errors. Further, associations due to mapping errors are likely to misleadingly replicate between studies. To help address this problem, we quantified the potential for ""cross-mapping'' to occur between every pair of annotated genes in the human genome. Such cross-mapping data can be used to filter or flag potential false positives in both trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses. Such filtering substantially alters the detection of significant associations and can have an impact on the assessment of false discovery rate, functional enrichment, and replication for RNA-sequencing association studies.",2019,,"list(name = ""Aaron R.

Array-based Comparative Genome Hybridization (aCGH), which is a high-throughput cytogenetic method, helps in identifying genome-wide copy number aberrations, both gains and losses. Here, we propose a computational technique to analyze aCGH data and to identify potential DNA copy number alterations along the genome. Our technique detects the possible breakpoints by comparing contiguous probe log ratios, reports the aberrant segments and handles outliers to minimize false discovery rate. Empirically, we tested our algorithm on both prokaryotic (Brucella ovis) and eukaryotic (glioblastoma and colorectal cancer datasets from human) genomes. Our findings complement previous studies; our performance is competitive, sometimes superior, against other popular methods.",2007,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Amitava Karmaker"", ids = ""3149387""); list(name = ""Stephen Kwek"", ids = ""1719127"")",,,In silico biology,7 6,"

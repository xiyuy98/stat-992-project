0e254a319a708ce3bf90b99b33b9ae322a53846b,Validity of the adherence estimator in the prediction of 9-month persistence with medications prescribed for chronic diseases: a prospective analysis of data from pharmacy claims.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this article was to assess the predictive validity of the Adherence Estimator--a 3-item instrument designed to estimate a patient's propensity to adhere to medications prescribed for chronic disease.


METHODS
The Adherence Estimator was a 3-item part of a larger survey mailed to adults aged >or=40 years who had a qualifying index prescription filled in June 2008. A qualifying prescription was defined as one for a medication indicated for the treatment of 1 of 5 chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia [lipid-lowering drugs], diabetes [oral antihyperglycemics], osteoporosis [oral bisphosphonates], or asthma). Outcomes were compared between the adherence risk groups derived from the Adherence Estimator (low risk = score of 0, medium risk = score of 2-7, and high risk = score of 8-36). Treatment persistence over a period of 9 months was measured using pharmacy claims data. The primary outcome was the median proportion of days covered (PDC) by >or=1 medication during the first 9 months after the index fill. Secondary outcomes included adherence to the index medication, defined as PDC dichotomized to >or=0.80 or <0.80; rate of obtaining a second fill within 30 days of the index fill; and medication possession ratio (MPR) for refill adherence.


RESULTS
There were 1676 usable responses. Ages ranged from 40 to 88 years, with a mean of 64.6 years. Almost two thirds (1076/1676 [64.2%]) of the sample were female, and 1483/1676 (88.5%) were white. Statistically significant associations for all 3 pairwise comparisons (low vs medium risk, low vs high risk, and medium vs high risk) were observed between the Adherence Estimator risk groups for: (1) median PDC (0.655, 0.598, and 0.484 in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, respectively [all, false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05]); (2) PDC categorized (293/711 [41.21%], 200/588 [34.01%], and 105/377 [27.85%] [all, FDR <0.05]); and (3) rate of obtaining a second fill for the index medication within 30 days (489/711 [68.78%], 374/588 [63.61%], and 207/377 [54.91%] [all, FDR <0.05]). The low- and high-risk groups differed from one another on: (1) persistence with the index medication at 9 months (265/711 [37.27%] and 95/377 [25.20%]); (2) persistence with >1 medication at 9 months (291/711 [40.93%] and 108/377 [28.65%]); and (3) obtaining a second fill for any medication within 30 days (501/711 [70.46%] and 219/377 [59.09%]) (all, P < 0.05). The low- and high-risk groups differed significantly from one another in MPR for refill adherence (0.912 vs 0.866). Results observed within diseases mirrored those for the total sample, but with less precision.


CONCLUSION
In the present analysis of the validity of the Adherence Estimator in predicting adherence, baseline propensity to adhere to medications prescribed for chronic diseases was statistically associated with several measures of adherence and persistence, as derived from pharmacy claims data, over a 9-month period.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Colleen A.

d069e7ad957dc6a5c7854b322f7e42dc644d370c,Noise cancellation using total variation for copy number variation detection,"BackgroundDue to recent advances in sequencing technologies, sequence-based analysis has been widely applied to detecting copy number variations (CNVs). There are several techniques for identifying CNVs using next generation sequencing (NGS) data, however methods employing depth of coverage or read depth (RD) have recently become a main technique to identify CNVs. The main assumption of the RD-based CNV detection methods is that the readcount value at a specific genomic location is correlated with the copy number at that location. However, readcount dataâ€™s noise and biases distort the association between the readcounts and copy numbers. For more accurate CNV identification, these biases and noise need to be mitigated. In this work, to detect CNVs more precisely and efficiently we propose a novel denoising method based on the total variation approach and the Taut String algorithm.ResultsTo investigate the performance of the proposed denoising method, we computed sensitivities, false discovery rates and specificities of CNV detection when employing denoising, using both simulated and real data. We also compared the performance of the proposed denoising method, Taut String, with that of the commonly used approaches such as moving average (MA) and discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) in terms of sensitivity of detecting true CNVs and time complexity. The results show that Taut String works better than DWT and MA and has a better power to identify very narrow CNVs. The ability of Taut String denoising in preserving CNV segmentsâ€™ breakpoints and narrow CNVs increases the detection accuracy of segmentation algorithms, resulting in higher sensitivities and lower false discovery rates.ConclusionsIn this study, we proposed a new denoising method for sequence-based CNV detection based on a signal processing technique. Existing CNV detection algorithms identify many false CNV segments and fail in detecting short CNV segments due to noise and biases. Employing an effective and efficient denoising method can significantly enhance the detection accuracy of the CNV segmentation algorithms. Advanced denoising methods from the signal processing field can be employed to implement such algorithms. We showed that non-linear denoising methods that consider sparsity and piecewise constant characteristics of CNV data result in better performance in CNV detection.",2018,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fatima Zare"", ids = ""14658933""); list(name = ""Abdelrahman Hosny"", ids = ""34580307""); list(name = ""Sheida Nabavi"", ids = ""145834073"")",ba7497f765efd3b46a43711508265167470994ec; f55a2d4c4fcc4f8915b43f944410dcd78cc94035; 8b874a3f94b207d03d2aab432a5e7b28dbef4ae9,9a2c55ea82ac0918e6fd686892ff572d37dc6fd5; 38a3e5e5f2385971c046366f3539c1bc6576e63f; 04ca20936b14e8113a63d5e7f448d23b5f3cc816; 6ab303486688912d833717659b29fb3e4dfbe01f; e8d449802a1775a8c9d3234bb8dcbd800c756ce2; e462182080b96336bf55801d393549391e94735c; 2db2b3cc2af9ed1b5f2e53fde2a1f395eebb7168; 22944e3c9e00137c85163ad9a9915632bcb65b18; 08dcce1698f912154cc77b9d8f0a2d94ac2575b2; 63c0530c84e9241e877ab69d49677512fa9789f7; 54d26e8c8ff638d6ffd9ac483b0057d507c399bb; f66932081e0847c30c40afbc6f5dc949afa9a308; 2cc257b0c7db92f90c3224c35df7b8e85f57a090; 0f0570761140c5a904e032765ba45ee7f78b602c; 3fab9720ddf259eab21465276f5e301c4b774c32; ffc6d2b341654b09e48676fb47df42e3f9fb9d3c; ac86096326c4e5101138faa4e273f953aa4e2ce1; 331d11ea1e7861207411df8810c9d35e6841a1d0; c11ccf3399c7e8473d81643265bae66f5164e06e; 3dba074bfa1241b05cd8ec6f1c36b246ea7fe7da; f2b9406faa3c40781d1d4968b89996cbce8d6d47; df15b56eb63101c341e875eefe01007cb308b63d; a07a39a697c4276faa12fd6b92fe183a0669da65; 0d37349cb5447e42f91e4c98c0195f5a52bf6d9b; fdea5bf5f09946b621b3585241e0d7e84b71e476; 66d265ca085ef86bfb79a1f71ed14a66be09f4dc; 8c0cf32901dee35ba6d44b38255183abbcdae501; 0e0aae9486cabbcff188d60416357112f14b9f12; 281939819f7ca10ea68d66913bbe2de34852d63a; 353520a8d431a2f4465b5fb704415c361ec3cf8e; bbd1ecf756fab875d86d26b70451c96a33d54f08; 4880f4a5c2a3946218c4fc3d5d0bbe6721b1e00a; 1da1ecb0dd4976ec3fd9f5207520a21f9f039c6e; e65fe2513409d841d3f9077ecb548f0931518373; 27fdd60841f275fcabe2e26b3d8ae95792649614; ed422c3353edd494899163782ac411374156f33b; 72e7a8c74b3c71bb4cfb63a9e92c3113a13155bb; 86aee9ecb45e543e24e1597505be8a7b7565bead; 3ba96f0cc9d122a549e06e71457d79e75b027474; f31375f51391b23414a09dec0c2550fd2c92ee15; 6fb2a3e7a025fa2288c7fdf970f5201b50ada31e; 0ec80c4c9b26edadd9b0e1e51f5202df5cb458ae; ec4b9637d9fc6cbe1230c269ce334984a4eb06b7; 555609c3e1bd32941fc8b1a2fa4dd33addb79922; 7629edc1e322409107f1ea6817ed4cd524fb01e6; 5cfa393e32dbc0003c903ee98cb424022cd581f4; 08e848d1a2fba5b5a19cc25a3fb2a61b88dbb2ff; f942cf8a040a874468b84d42b1aa73cec48fe02f; a995603c3cbe25b311fe16b9ae8d9624f717659b; 218aed10cd9dedecd789d8251f40fa446a4ab629; 07f7cab12a16bb2c4ad8f5c8eab7ea383b5321c6; 874cc3d7f38afed3543f961b49511aead2c91457; 6f753c5194c3daa5c2d4b44ec3d079e7dadde0fa; 98e5b39243f0428fbda31b24e3845dda4000d009; 4e65b6fda6624b4c1263b260234e2fc366cef076; 5c9b55daac549a3c42f4bffe53316488316e1820; d974e0dbbaf83f72f8d300121ecabfdbb7265467; 00ae21c9a84bc24f35448acddcf4fd30539604a0; 50e98fd0e7e5290c2418adfc4bd4e0c100e4e836; 92712a08f0a4f10d054706fdfd62e752750c1589; 0887554e9049fb836dd864a29ae54395ea082ad9; ca864b128cc24be4504e2d4946d783b59a482138; 3fb26a65d1528d8e3c8c5e58ed9622698ba051b9; 09f5e07cbb25191764b07ce90f6bbb9ceebfa01f; 3937df87f1990cdaa9999db8302ba05f871cab01; 09b053572b43ee8997ccb8e6382d33beaf2a6cc9,BMC Bioinformatics,19,
36889f6335ba02bad27d8a1fe4748080e9d50ca0,Predictive Value of Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient for Graft Hemodynamics in Living Donor Liver Transplantation.,"The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement is known to correlate with the severity of portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. This retrospective study investigated the clinical value of preoperative measurement of HVPG in patients who underwent adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and its predictive value for hepatic hemodynamics after graft reperfusion. For this study, 75 patients who underwent adult-to-adult LDLT were divided into 2 groups (HVPGÂ <16Â mm Hg or HVPGÂ â‰¥16Â mm Hg) to investigate the correlation between preoperative HVPG and characteristics and surgical outcomes of the patients, including portal vein flow (PVF) and hepatic artery flow (HAF) after graft reperfusion. In total, 35 (46.7%) patients had an HVPGÂ â‰¥16Â mm Hg. These patients had significantly higher international normalized ratio values, serum creatinine levels, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores compared with the 40 patients with HVPGÂ <16Â mm Hg. They also had higher rates of variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, and intractable ascites as well as lower serum albumin levels and platelet counts compared with those patients with HVPGÂ <16Â mm Hg. Portal inflow modulation (PIM) was frequently performed in the patients with HVPGÂ â‰¥16Â mm Hg compared with those with HVPGÂ <16Â mm Hg. No significant differences in surgical outcomes after LDLT were found between these 2 groups except for postoperative ascites. Preoperative HVPG showed a positive correlation with PVF and a negative correlation with HAF after graft reperfusion (false discovery rate [FDR] PÂ =Â 0.08 and FDR PÂ =Â 0.08, respectively). In linear regression analyses, preoperative HVPG was independently associated with PVF after graft reperfusion. In conclusion, our findings indicate that preoperative HVPG is associated with hepatic hemodynamics after graft implantation in LDLT. HVPG as a routine preoperative evaluation may be helpful for surgical planning of PIM.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hajime Matsushima"", ids = ""152955263""); list(name = ""Masato Fujiki"", ids = ""1928023""); list(name = ""Kazunari Sasaki"", ids = ""40266352""); list(name = ""Daniel M.

be4913d40181a9247bbaea6583897e66095e23d6,Blood and Intestine eQTLs from an Anti-TNF-Resistant Crohn's Disease Cohort Inform IBD Genetic Association Loci,"OBJECTIVES:Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci reproducibly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other immune-mediated diseases; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying most of genetic susceptibility remain undefined. Expressional quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of disease-relevant tissue can be employed in order to elucidate the genes and pathways affected by disease-specific genetic variance.METHODS:In this study, we derived eQTLs for human whole blood and intestine tissues of anti-tumor necrosis factor-resistant Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) patients. We interpreted these eQTLs in the context of published IBD GWAS hits to inform on the disease process.RESULTS:At 10% false discovery rate, we discovered that 5,174 genes in blood and 2,063 genes in the intestine were controlled by a nearby single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (i.e., cis-eQTL), among which 1,360 were shared between the two tissues. A large fraction of the identified eQTLs were supported by the regulomeDB database, showing that the eQTLs reside in regulatory elements (odds ratio; OR=3.44 and 3.24 for blood and intestine eQTLs, respectively) as opposed to protein-coding regions. Published IBD GWAS hits as a whole were enriched for blood and intestine eQTLs (OR=2.88 and 2.05; and P value=2.51E-9 and 0.013, respectively), thereby linking genetic susceptibility to control of gene expression in these tissues. Through a systematic search, we used eQTL data to inform 109 out of 372 IBD GWAS SNPs documented in National Human Genome Research Institute catalog, and we categorized the genes influenced by eQTLs according to their functions. Many of these genes have experimentally validated roles in specific cell types contributing to intestinal inflammation.CONCLUSIONS:The blood and intestine eQTLs described in this study represent a powerful tool to link GWAS loci to a regulatory function and thus elucidate the mechanisms underlying the genetic loci associated with IBD and related conditions. Overall, our eQTL discovery approach empirically identifies the disease-associated variants including their impact on the direction and extent of expression changes in the context of disease-relevant cellular pathways in order to infer the functional outcome of this aspect of genetic susceptibility.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Antonio F Di Narzo"", ids = ""2704710""); list(name = ""Lauren A Peters"", ids = ""5347178""); list(name = ""Carmen A.

197e8ae5efdf57f5b3c00d33027f16aca1dbdcbc,CSF neurofilament-light chain and phosphorylated-tau predict disease progression in PSP (P4.176),"Objective: To determine the ability of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to predict disease progression in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Background: PSP is a 4-repeat tauopathy with strong links to tau gene ( MAPT) polymorphisms. In PSP, CSF tau and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau) concentrations are often lower than age-matched controls, but the clinical significance of these changes is uncertain. Plasma neurofilament-light chain (NfL) has shown potential utility to predict PSP progression, but stronger relationships with clinical features are expected with CSF analyte concentrations. Design/Methods: We compared the ability of baseline CSF amyloid Î² 1â€“42 , tau, p-tau and NfL concentrations, measured by INNO-BIA AlzBio3 or ELISA, to predict annual changes in clinical [(PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SEADL)], neuropsychological and regional brain volumes on MRI using linear mixed effects models controlled for age, sex and baseline disease severity, and Fisherâ€™s-F density curves to compare effect sizes in 50 PSP patients. Results: Higher CSF NfL concentration predicted more rapid decline (biomarker Ã— time interaction) over 52 weeks in PSPRS ( p = .004, false discovery rate-corrected) and SEADL ( p = .008), whereas lower baseline CSF p-tau predicted faster decline on PSPRS ( p = .004). Higher CSF tau concentrations predicted faster decline by SEADL ( p = .004). The CSF NfL/p-tau ratio was superior for predicting change in PSPRS, compared to p-tau ( p = .003) or NfL ( p = .001) alone. Higher NfL concentrations were associated with greater superior cerebellar peduncle atrophy (fixed effect, p â‰¤ .029), whereas none of the other biomarkers were associated with brain volumes. Conclusions: Both CSF p-tau and NfL correlate with disease severity and rate of disease progression in PSP. The inverse correlation of p-tau with disease severity suggests a potentially different mechanism of tau pathology in PSP as compared to Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

8729c15d01761f56ec490d354dd8c72d2df0a42c,DNMT1 is associated with cell cycle and DNA replication gene sets in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,"Dysregulation of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is associated with the pathogenesis of various types of cancer. It has been previously shown that DNMT1 is frequently expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), however its functions remain to be elucidated in the disease. In this study, we gene expression profiled (GEP) shRNA targeting DNMT1(shDNMT1)-treated germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL)-derived cell line (i.e. HT) compared with non-silencing shRNA (control shRNA)-treated HT cells. Independent gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed using GEPs of shRNA-treated HT cells and primary GCB-DLBCL cases derived from two publicly-available datasets (i.e. GSE10846 and GSE31312) produced three separate lists of enriched gene sets for each gene sets collection from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Subsequent Venn analysis identified 268, 145 and six consensus gene sets from analyzing gene sets in C2 collection (curated gene sets), C5 sub-collection [gene sets from gene ontology (GO) biological process ontology] and Hallmark collection, respectively to be enriched in positive correlation with DNMT1 expression profiles in shRNA-treated HT cells, GSE10846 and GSE31312 datasets [false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05]. Cell cycle progression and DNA replication were among the significantly enriched biological processes (FDR <0.05). Expression of genes involved in the activation of cell cycle and DNA replication (e.g. CDK1, CCNA2, E2F2, PCNA, RFC5 and POLD3) were highly correlated (r>0.8) with DNMT1 expression and significantly downregulated (log fold-change <-1.35; p<0.05) following DNMT1 silencing in HT cells. These results suggest the involvement of DNMT1 in the activation of cell cycle and DNA replication in DLBCL cells.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Suet Kee Loo"", ids = ""40621824""); list(name = ""Suzina Sheikh Ab Hamid"", ids = ""36318969""); list(name = ""Mustaffa Musa"", ids = ""20255807""); list(name = ""Kah Keng Wong"", ids = ""5089325"")",70075dd1ae2207a37ba16c73c00548a65861d915; b97c36b6dc8b2f38c70930ac9e45ffb10472e8e0; 9fb3d102c0eb10937480e81f0100339137bcaed2; 797b0a008f3b977c372017cc22d73d391508ae6a; 1b210e4b9c59f70f665ec09bc6688e03e7e57508,,"Pathology, research and practice",214 1,"

In order to achieve this goal, a study needs to have an adequate sample size to ensure the desired power. Owing to the importance of this topic, a number of approaches to sample size calculation have been developed. However, due to the cost and/or experimental difficulties in obtaining sufficient biological materials, it might be difficult to attain the required sample size. In this article, we address more practical questions for assessing power and false discovery rate (FDR) for a fixed sample size. The relationships between power, sample size and FDR are explored. We also conduct simulations and a real data study to evaluate the proposed findings.",2008,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tiejun Tong"", ids = ""48992084""); list(name = ""Hongyu Zhao"", ids = ""46431059"")",3faaefced4475838e527739bc5181c49f51b30cd; 4120efc492bd7101ed13009ebe0553aa2abffcf2; b754f4ab5800638df281b0f4d00a95d4a2e189c2; ffc4b8eb78df46068fe3a8816b6d481acf46f437; efc866b569c0dd3b8f5229d23539abf5a95a1bcf; 7700731795e33a2374a9f5ae2db9b4156072f77c; a4be16a977050b9b06950a973281d7e004b2010c; b5fc82080bff0deb96122781c2e8b45bd2fadb2c; 3073d402cc789919b434f92b3871ea26e5828624; 6701f7cc91717b31d2068f50f5b808474bfe0e53; b3e7cbb603d112249bfef710e4012012f9b55a6a; 7354e82d8d53ef2fe8bd904700ec95ca78599f81; 603b6096ba33049a43e40e8999d0c1d572ddc9df; c96e5c89ea54780687c5008fa5049c4843ec3684; 2de7f512760feaf0f6b102c75b1afdffc53e896c; 568c3e85b72a56de87e2f15cd98e11236b1152ab; f62dd2ddf07463a366da176bf7294923140b7b5b; f6976f0f4c2b259f071ae1ead5670ef27eaec41c; c5f75819f4a9a4498743b09892a0882a480dbbbf; 00eed1349839adaf0ee74db483b88dd165418729; 6850ea7af4a5e6d3a8d402da2ddad19946921a11; 7e52445a90795a25117cf5be9955ab6a88ed05d6; 069791181f2da74196b15442a8adf8d061cb48c3,,Statistics in medicine,27 11,"

318b5bfab9174fb51e8c6af4df10cf9cf5a89530,Microenvironmental Changes in DCIS: Myoepithelial Cells Change from Tumour Suppressor to Tumour Promoter.,"Background: The mechanism of transition of ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) to invasive cancer is poorly understood but recently changes in the microenvironment have been implicated. A unique feature of the DCIS microenvironment is the presence of a myoepithelial population. Normal myoepithelial cells (MECs) have a broad tumour suppressor function but these cells show changes in gene expression and phenotype in DCIS.Hypothesis: We hypothesised that during the evolution of DCIS breast myoepithelial cells undergo a switch in gene expression profile that compromises their suppressor function and may lead to promotion of tumour progression.Materials and methods: To investigate this, Immuno-Laser Capture Microdissection was used to isolate MECs from normal and DCIS breast tissues followed by whole genome expression profiling using Affymetrix HGU-133 plus2.0 arrays. The data were analysed using Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org) packages within the open source R statistical environment (www.r-project.org). We set a double threshold for significant changes in gene expression with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) 50%) and presence of invasion (p=0.006). Moreover, culture of normal and DCIS-modified MEC lines on a Fibronectin matrix revealed that FN1 modifies MEC function and abrogates their tumour suppressor activity.Other key alterations identified and validated include up-regulation of the recently characterised Nephronectin and down-regulation of PTHLH, FGFR2, ADAMTS5, TGFBR3, and CAV2, each of which has been implicated in suppressing tumour growth and invasion or inhibition of angiogenesis.Conclusion and significance: This is the first study to use this in-vivo technique to investigate molecular changes in MEC in DCIS and to reveal that DCIS associated MECs show up-regulation of the tumour-promoting molecule FN1. Our data support the hypothesis that there is switch in MEC function from suppressor to potential promoter activity that can influence the progression of in-situ to invasive disease and may lead to novel predictive and therapeutic targets.

3aff2d12ceb545dae034cea8188f37ce40537c71,Design and initial characterization of the SC-200 proteomics standard mixture.,"High-throughput (HTP) proteomics studies generate large amounts of data. Interpretation of these data requires effective approaches to distinguish noise from biological signal, particularly as instrument and computational capacity increase and studies become more complex. Resolving this issue requires validated and reproducible methods and models, which in turn requires complex experimental and computational standards. The absence of appropriate standards and data sets for validating experimental and computational workflows hinders the development of HTP proteomics methods. Most protein standards are simple mixtures of proteins or peptides, or undercharacterized reference standards in which the identity and concentration of the constituent proteins is unknown. The Seattle Children's 200 (SC-200) proposed proteomics standard mixture is the next step toward developing realistic, fully characterized HTP proteomics standards. The SC-200 exhibits a unique modular design to extend its functionality, and consists of 200 proteins of known identities and molar concentrations from 6 microbial genomes, distributed into 10 molar concentration tiers spanning a 1,000-fold range. We describe the SC-200's design, potential uses, and initial characterization. We identified 84% of SC-200 proteins with an LTQ-Orbitrap and 65% with an LTQ-Velos (false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰1% for both). There were obvious trends in success rate, sequence coverage, and spectral counts with protein concentration; however, protein identification, sequence coverage, and spectral counts vary greatly within concentration levels.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew T Bauman"", ids = ""35946123""); list(name = ""Roger Higdon"", ids = ""145963609""); list(name = ""Sean Rapson"", ids = ""114504150""); list(name = ""Brenton Loiue"", ids = ""116036623""); list(name = ""Jason M.

DNA methylation is implicated in coronary heart disease (CHD), but current evidence is based on small, cross-sectional studies. We examined blood DNA methylation in relation to incident CHD across multiple prospective cohorts.


METHODS
Nine population-based cohorts from the United States and Europe profiled epigenome-wide blood leukocyte DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium 450k microarray, and prospectively ascertained CHD events including coronary insufficiency/unstable angina, recognized myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and coronary death. Cohorts conducted race-specific analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, body mass index, blood cell type proportions, and technical variables. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses across cohorts.


RESULTS
Among 11â€‰461 individuals (mean age 64 years, 67% women, 35% African American) free of CHD at baseline, 1895 developed CHD during a mean follow-up of 11.2 years. Methylation levels at 52 CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites were associated with incident CHD or myocardial infarction (false discovery rate<0.05). These CpGs map to genes with key roles in calcium regulation (ATP2B2, CASR, GUCA1B, HPCAL1), and genes identified in genome- and epigenome-wide studies of serum calcium (CASR), serum calcium-related risk of CHD (CASR), coronary artery calcified plaque (PTPRN2), and kidney function (CDH23, HPCAL1), among others. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal effect of DNA methylation on incident CHD; these CpGs map to active regulatory regions proximal to long non-coding RNA transcripts.


CONCLUSION
Methylation of blood-derived DNA is associated with risk of future CHD across diverse populations and may serve as an informative tool for gaining further insight on the development of CHD.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Golareh Agha"", ids = ""34922753""); list(name = ""Michael M Mendelson"", ids = ""6296186""); list(name = ""Cavin K.

bc3eb845f73c97e37cd52fed0b572c3f11cb4713,Neutrophil-Related Gene Expression and Low-Density Granulocytes Associated With Disease Activity and Response to Treatment in Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis.,"OBJECTIVE
To discover biomarkers involved in the pathophysiology of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and to determine whether low-density granulocytes (LDGs) contribute to gene expression signatures in AAV.


METHODS
The source of clinical data and linked biologic specimens was a randomized controlled treatment trial in AAV. RNA sequencing of whole blood from patients with AAV was performed during active disease at the baseline visit and during remission 6 months later. Gene expression was compared between patients who met versus those who did not meet the primary trial outcome of clinical remission at 6 months (responders versus nonresponders). Measurement of neutrophil-related gene expression was confirmed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to validate the findings in whole blood. A negative-selection strategy isolated LDGs from PBMC fractions.


RESULTS
Differential expression between responders (nâ€‰=â€‰77) and nonresponders (nâ€‰=â€‰35) was detected in 2,346 transcripts at the baseline visit (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering demonstrated a cluster of granulocyte-related genes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3). A granulocyte multigene composite score was significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and during active disease than during remission (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). This signature strongly overlapped an LDG signature identified previously in lupus (false discovery rate by gene set enrichment analysis <0.01). Transcription of PR3 measured in PBMCs was associated with active disease and treatment response (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01). LDGs isolated from patients with AAV spontaneously formed neutrophil extracellular traps containing PR3 and MPO.


CONCLUSION
In AAV, increased expression of a granulocyte gene signature is associated with disease activity and decreased response to treatment. The source of this signature is likely LDGs, a potentially pathogenic cell type in AAV.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter C Grayson"", ids = ""8374184""); list(name = ""Carmelo Carmona-Rivera"", ids = ""1401344325""); list(name = ""Lijing Xu"", ids = ""47775713""); list(name = ""Noha Lim"", ids = ""2177765""); list(name = ""Z.

de65328fd84e6149af13a9c46130117a6c9c0fff,Role of Fusobacteria in the serrated pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis,"Fusobacteria are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and are amplified during colorectal carcinogenesis. Compared to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of carcinogenesis, serrated neoplasm has distinct clinical features and a different molecular background. We aimed to compare the gut microbiome between tubular adenoma (TA) and sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P). Patients with TA, SSA/P, or CRC were recruited. Three pieces of colorectal mucosal tissue were obtained from each patient by endoscopic biopsy. 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) were performed. Among 26 enrolled patients, 8, 10, and 8 had TA, SSA/P, and CRC, respectively. The relative abundance of Fusobacteria did not differ significantly between the TA and SSA/P groups (4.3% and 1.9%, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.739) but was higher in the CRC group (33.8%) than in the TA or SSA/P group, respectively (TA vs. CRC, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002, false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰=â€‰0.023; SSA/P vs. CRC, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001, FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.001). PICRUSt revealed that most functions in the TA metagenome were similar to those in the SSA/P metagenome.

f295e84ac7dd4633d59ac414cee2166f7f6a6964,Targeted Feature Detection for Data-Dependent Shotgun Proteomics,"Label-free quantification of shotgun LC-MS/MS data is the prevailing approach in quantitative proteomics but remains computationally nontrivial. The central data analysis step is the detection of peptide-specific signal patterns, called features. Peptide quantification is facilitated by associating signal intensities in features with peptide sequences derived from MS2 spectra; however, missing values due to imperfect feature detection are a common problem. A feature detection approach that directly targets identified peptides (minimizing missing values) but also offers robustness against false-positive features (by assigning meaningful confidence scores) would thus be highly desirable. We developed a new feature detection algorithm within the OpenMS software framework, leveraging ideas and algorithms from the OpenSWATH toolset for DIA/SRM data analysis. Our software, FeatureFinderIdentification (""FFId""), implements a targeted approach to feature detection based on information from identified peptides. This information is encoded in an MS1 assay library, based on which ion chromatogram extraction and detection of feature candidates are carried out. Significantly, when analyzing data from experiments comprising multiple samples, our approach distinguishes between ""internal"" and ""external"" (inferred) peptide identifications (IDs) for each sample. On the basis of internal IDs, two sets of positive (true) and negative (decoy) feature candidates are defined. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained to discriminate between the sets and is subsequently applied to the ""uncertain"" feature candidates from external IDs, facilitating selection and confidence scoring of the best feature candidate for each peptide. This approach also enables our algorithm to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) of the feature selection step. We validated FFId based on a public benchmark data set, comprising a yeast cell lysate spiked with protein standards that provide a known ground-truth. The algorithm reached almost complete (>99%) quantification coverage for the full set of peptides identified at 1% FDR (PSM level). Compared with other software solutions for label-free quantification, this is an outstanding result, which was achieved at competitive quantification accuracy and reproducibility across replicates. The FDR for the feature selection was estimated at a low 1.5% on average per sample (3% for features inferred from external peptide IDs). The FFId software is open-source and freely available as part of OpenMS ( www.openms.org ).",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hendrik Weisser"", ids = ""49487242""); list(name = ""Jyoti S.

743017aaf32719142d28ced5ae779ba192279716,Estrogen Receptor Î² as a Therapeutic Target in Breast Cancer Stem Cells,"Background
Breast cancer cells with tumor-initiating capabilities (BSCs) are considered to maintain tumor growth and govern metastasis. Hence, targeting BSCs will be crucial to achieve successful treatment of breast cancer.


Methods
We characterized mammospheres derived from more than 40 cancer patients and two breast cancer cell lines for the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and stem cell markers. Mammosphere formation and proliferation assays were performed on cells from 19 cancer patients and five healthy individuals after incubation with ER-subtype selective ligands. Transcriptional analysis was performed to identify pathways activated in ERÎ²-stimulated mammospheres and verified using in vitro experiments. Xenograft models (nâ€‰=â€‰4 or 5 per group) were used to study the role of ERs during tumorigenesis.


Results
We identified an absence of ERÎ± but upregulation of ERÎ² in BSCs associated with phenotypic stem cell markers and responsible for the proliferative role of estrogens. Knockdown of ERÎ² caused a reduction of mammosphere formation in cell lines and in patient-derived cancer cells (40.7%, 26.8%, and 39.1%, respectively). Gene set enrichment analysis identified glycolysis-related pathways (false discovery rate < 0.001) upregulated in ERÎ²-activated mammospheres. We observed that tamoxifen or fulvestrant alone was insufficient to block proliferation of patient-derived BSCs while this could be accomplished by a selective inhibitor of ERÎ² (PHTPP; 53.7% in luminal and 45.5% in triple-negative breast cancers). Furthermore, PHTPP reduced tumor initiation in two patient-derived xenografts (75.9% and 59.1% reduction in tumor volume, respectively) and potentiated tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in MCF7 xenografts.


Conclusion
We identify ERÎ² as a mediator of estrogen action in BSCs and a novel target for endocrine therapy.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ran Ma"", ids = ""50397204""); list(name = ""Govindasamy-Muralidharan Karthik"", ids = ""120560026""); list(name = ""John LÃ¶vrot"", ids = ""5815972""); list(name = ""Felix Haglund"", ids = ""2476319""); list(name = ""Gustaf Rosin"", ids = ""48168423""); list(name = ""Anne Katchy"", ids = ""4394001""); list(name = ""Xiaonan Zhang"", ids = ""47957943""); list(name = ""Lisa Viberg"", ids = ""39782338""); list(name = ""Jan Frisell"", ids = ""6830794""); list(name = ""Cecilia Williams"", ids = ""5403218""); list(name = ""Stig Linder"", ids = ""7620016""); list(name = ""Irma Fredriksson"", ids = ""35027603""); list(name = ""Johan Hartman"", ids = ""2055412"")",7b24304b805a4335947a1f61f3b3781a77ccdadc; 5fc68343f9262a0c25004ec71ae94672693e10ce; aee39b52fa3f7f3b6f3f3539eed55ed811823df8; 794275b7ecc2ea8c35dc59b2c70eb170bccaf983; c627e8829e0628de1fdd1b429fd381027e25cbff; 4668d493aba5ba1d852c00670f758f38a946573c; da08d497b6a2851ea261aab6db54045a9a1c369a; 7aefa2a5d0cbb5cd791faa12d09e72f0ed7652aa; 7efcd0b08b28b0020d8a3e0d164a6c3772088c76; e35d9c89120cc2557d7ac767c28cc8a94912c2de; c054a2e21de233c4e0ee0ec00cd15babde17b984,397dc74ae01218139da37954a3c202235d96e08d; 1b284be953f2398880e1134e8b9a9b310082279e; 8ed398374724cea17f6a05f6a373b54821ca95de; e47042a151e6c30bb0e48a8b2c7173ed9d55e7e7; 3f11360c8b59c737b0d85ddfa7bd04a54d5a15f0; 53c808c2666d08be7e821898470cf3bed0baff91; bf2e4a83b54ac47b72c15357c99e6d381e10d666; 2a0bf30dc789b2f9aa9f1078cff496afe54134e2; cc0fe9633d6021937724c597151ce03567bf3711; 42dc0c10d35f8f08156ace09ba5d1bd31bf26272; 3adee1a7250d4ccba9462ddbedd670723ca98ec2; b2f7c81e1baa3217704dbf3bb25b3f41d78a7f3a; f5a6bc5ad31941bc5d5c8f092299015ce10f4130; 3f585823f1902f03212a2d736a69ef7016987b3c; 903d6913fdf52ed1cb8db0861f395304a830e699; cd55a6b3dc569e457e90963d3382b58df3e0d84f; c2f09e4a0ca3ff243ccf3257b9d29af0bbba87a9; 2acd549c75b8c404cd778339238260fab35ca8f0; 9d5da63b9a13abe32d7065eba4eb29feb41edfc2; a6dd0e3266f7a07114f849e22235f2e89351c7e2; cea924d946eefa9972121438313459f92ef8a246; 31f97b911b642ae0ac677a9348de900fd7a0762a; fb2409cf57a87091c634088757b14a8050a81a06; e0ef322cbbb18872ba8ffb768fd6e04989bde1ea; 74c756d1b3d6e96dcbe27feedc3a39e47752f699; 2d42a26074947868c4d036c6dece08603f91cd89; 00a8d1752c61f76e4ea4cce094857e2db2eccd8f; d755d403929c73143750392a081fa7bff1390d3c; 9f31bacf809351c076c86bc51ac7ab6bd8266149; 3711f66c6c984da9308fb59738efa535585c8632; fa398eb0c18d9ae8b0c1fcec2da656e3d18cdfb6; 8c11cbe4af0217204e5ccd84c152059de7bd89d7; b3e7db806076a11c3e7a32f10d0f62db3d4995b5; 3dd32b4ca93aaf7ba0342f634e1381d51428459f; 7a33a7ff4bf3607511ee819604515f7628bb819f; afae4f6d0cfb19d9cb6a077401477bad71cfc75c; d4e3eee1dc8415cf34b8c07b9093e1b9d20b17ec; 1b4a7c4631dbcae0d86dbf9e49bb13f78e1df97a; e9b911316ca0cbeb8b3a3ffc230363c3e97427cf; 087cef763968a688c808f840e2f99e2b625ba7de; e9331c48df74d8ebf6351e589f6d31ecef145e0e; 319aae10216ebf640dad36e4012a166c1e9010cc; 8e03630a1ddd8b4b810bda6f21d32d6c7a41774d; cb86aa4c2de9d4d8f93f1352ffa08274b6a8158a; d39e313adf53adc83f18c4a311c254d7e84967b4; 3c47c5de3dee672da73905cb6adaaff35c9bf3fd; 2f532a04832fac62122958a8c1c34b2c9503f8db; 41cad9270342b0521b906bb067e83e674faaa88a; 035d28c55bc8dcaac258448dbac50edc2425b643; 2ec73246034899f8ab87008bf80b79395d91b06a,JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute,109,

Background: BRG1 is the major catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and provides ATPase activity necessary for transcriptional regulation of multiple cellular pathways. BRG1 is frequently inactivated in lung cancers and loss of BRG1 is correlated with poor prognosis. Methods: Sixty eight NSCLC cell lines were analyzed. BRG1 protein was detected by western blotting using nuclear extracts. SMARCA4 deletions or mutations were identified by NextGen sequencing and/or Sanger sequencing using genomic DNA or cDNA. Published reports and SNP analysis were also used to verify our results. Gene expression profiles were determined by Illumina human WG-6 V3 beadchip. Microarray expression data was analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) and Hierarchical clustering analysis. Results: Twenty five NSCLC cell lines had lost BRG1 protein expression. Sequencing analysis found homozygous mutations (deletions, nonsense, splicing site) in twenty two of the lines. Among forty three NSCLC cell lines with BRG1 protein expression, five had homozygous missense mutations, four had heterozygous mutations. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that nearly 1500 transcripts were differentially up or down regulated (false discovery rate Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

e8a086fa5b9bb004b3063ceea07165ce7bc19746,An iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis reveals dysregulation of neocortical synaptopodin in Lewy body dementias,"Lewy body dementias are the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia in the elderly after Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). The two clinical subgroups of Lewy body dementias, namely, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinsonâ€™s disease dementia (PDD), are differentiated by the chronology of cognitive symptoms relative to parkinsonism. At present, there remains a debate on whether DLB and PDD are separate disease entities, or fall within the same spectrum of Lewy body dementias. In this study, we compared the detergent-soluble proteome via an 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis of pooled lysates from the prefrontal cortex (BA9) of DLB (n = 19) and PDD (n = 21) patients matched a priori for amyloid (total AÎ²42) burden, semi-quantitative scores for Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles together with age-matched control (n = 21) subjects. A total of 1914 proteins were confidently identified by iTRAQ (false discovery rate = 0%). None of the proteins showed a significant yet opposite regulation in between DLB and PDD when compared to aged controls in the proteomic data set as well as following immunoblot analysis of the pooled and individual lysates involving all 61 subjects. The postsynaptic protein, synaptopodin (SYNPO) was significantly down-regulated in both DLB and PDD subgroups, suggesting a defective synaptic transmission in the demented patients. In conclusion, the largely similar proteome of DLB and PDD matched for amyloid burden suggests that variations in concomitant AD-related pathology, abnormal post-translational modifications or protein-protein interactions, defective intracellular trafficking or misfolding of proteins could play a part in driving the clinically observed differences between these two subgroups of Lewy body dementias. This further indicates that amyloid-targeting therapeutic strategies may show different efficacies in DLB versus PDD.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arnab Datta"", ids = ""145055817""); list(name = ""Yuek Ling Chai"", ids = ""6043046""); list(name = ""Jean-Marie Tan"", ids = ""22546696""); list(name = ""Jasinda H.

1a7836a7cf9d9f89ffa378dc04a6e33756e970ef,Effects of Lithium Monotherapy for Bipolar Disorder on Gene Expression in Peripheral Lymphocytes,"Background: This study investigated the effect of lithium monotherapy on peripheral lymphocyte gene expression in bipolar disorder (BD). Method: Twenty-two medication-free bipolar subjects (11 hypomanic, 11 depressed) were started on lithium monotherapy. Closely matched healthy subjects (n = 15) were included as controls but did not receive treatment. Blood RNA samples were collected at baseline and after 2 and 8 weeks of treatment. RNA expression was measured using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST Array followed by Ingenuity pathways analysis. The results for the contrast of weeks 2 and 8 were not significantly different and were combined. Results: In BD subjects, 56 genes showed significant (false discovery rate <0.1) expression changes from baseline; the effect sizes and directions for all of these were similar at weeks 2 and 8. Among these were immune-related genes (IL5RA, MOK, IFI6, and RFX2), purinergic receptors (P2RY14, P2RY2, and ADORA3) and signal transduction-related genes (CAMK1 and PIK3R6). Pathway and upstream regulator analysis also revealed that lithium altered several immune- and signal transduction-related functions. Differentially expressed genes did not correlate with week 8 clinical response, but other genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation did. Conclusion: Peripheral gene expression may serve as a biomarker of lithium effect.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Amit Anand"", ids = ""3374892""); list(name = ""Jeanette N.

db7f959fd8471f6a486aabe2880b225cfb5bbd6e,The Ranking Probability Approach and Its Usage in Design and Analysis of Large-Scale Studies,"In experiments with many statistical tests there is need to balance type I and type II error rates while taking multiplicity into account. In the traditional approach, the nominal [Formula: see text]-level such as 0.05 is adjusted by the number of tests, [Formula: see text], i.e., as 0.05/[Formula: see text]. Assuming that some proportion of tests represent ""true signals"", that is, originate from a scenario where the null hypothesis is false, power depends on the number of true signals and the respective distribution of effect sizes. One way to define power is for it to be the probability of making at least one correct rejection at the assumed [Formula: see text]-level. We advocate an alternative way of establishing how ""well-powered"" a study is. In our approach, useful for studies with multiple tests, the ranking probability [Formula: see text] is controlled, defined as the probability of making at least [Formula: see text] correct rejections while rejecting hypotheses with [Formula: see text] smallest P-values. The two approaches are statistically related. Probability that the smallest P-value is a true signal (i.e., [Formula: see text]) is equal to the power at the level [Formula: see text], to an very good excellent approximation. Ranking probabilities are also related to the false discovery rate and to the Bayesian posterior probability of the null hypothesis. We study properties of our approach when the effect size distribution is replaced for convenience by a single ""typical"" value taken to be the mean of the underlying distribution. We conclude that its performance is often satisfactory under this simplification; however, substantial imprecision is to be expected when [Formula: see text] is very large and [Formula: see text] is small. Precision is largely restored when three values with the respective abundances are used instead of a single typical effect size value.",2013,Physics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chia-Ling Kuo"", ids = ""47387190""); list(name = ""Dmitri V.

89c2d163010c1d28a0957e92996dafe755d09958,"Differential gene expression between normal and pale, soft, and exudative turkey meat.","In response to high consumer demand, turkeys have been intensively selected for rapid growth rate and breast muscle mass and conformation. The success in breeding selection has coincided with an increasing incidence of pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) meat defect, especially in response to heat stress. We hypothesized that the underlying mechanism responsible for the development of PSE meat arises from differences in expression of several critical genes. The objective of this study was to determine differential gene expression between normal and PSE turkey meat using a 6K turkey skeletal muscle long oligonucleotide microarray. Breast meat samples were collected from Randombred Control Line 2 turkeys at 22 wk of age, and classified as normal or PSE primarily based on marinade uptake (high = normal, low = PSE). Total RNA was isolated from meat samples with the highest (normal, n = 6) and the lowest (PSE, n = 6) marinade uptake. Microarray data confirmation was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR. Selection of differentially expressed genes for pathway analysis was performed using a combination of fold change (FC) ranking (FC < -1.66, FC >1.66) and false discovery rate (<0.35) as criteria. The calcium signaling pathway was highlighted as the top canonical pathway associated with differential gene expression between normal and PSE turkey. Dramatic downregulation of fast-twitch myosin heavy chain coupled with upregulation of slow-twitch myosin and troponin C suggested a switch of skeletal muscle isoforms, which may alter muscle fiber arrangement and formation of actin-myosin complexes. Changes in expression of genes in the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway also suggest altered structures of actin filaments that may affect cell motility as well as strength and flexibility of muscle cells.

Patel, MD, Lorena Ostilla, MD, Lyda Cuervo-Pardo, MD, Sergejs Berdnikovs, PhD, and Sergio E. Chiarella, MD; Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL. RATIONALE: The transmembrane protein 178 (Tmem178) is a novel negative regulator of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFAT1c); a recognized player in asthma pathogenesis. Our group has previously shown that changes in TMEM178 gene expression are associated with lower airway obstruction in asthmatics having an acute respiratory illness-induced exacerbation. We sought to compare the relative gene expression of TMEM178 in the airway epithelium of severe asthmatics to that in the airway epithelium of non-severe asthmatics and healthy controls. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of two high-quality publicly available microarray datasets (National Center for Biotechnology Informationâ€™s Gene Expression Omnibus database; accession numbers GSE43696 andGSE63142), which contained epithelial brushings obtained by bronchoscopy from asthmatics and healthy donors. For differential gene expression comparisons, moderated Benjamini-Hochberg t-tests (with false discovery rate adjustments) and Dunnâ€™s multiple comparison tests were used. RESULTS: In the first microarray study (GSE43696), severe asthmatics had significantly lower levels of TMEM178 gene expression when compared to moderate asthmatics (p-value <0.05) and healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). Similarly, in the second microarray study (GSE63142), severe asthmatics had significantly lower levels of TMEM178 gene expression when compared to non-severe asthmatics (pvalue <0.001) and healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). Overall, TMEM178 gene expression negatively correlates with asthma severity. CONCLUSIONS: In two independent microarray studies, the relative gene expression of TMEM178 decreased with the progression of asthma severity. We speculate that Tmem178 may play an important role in the regulation of NFAT-induced inflammation in severe asthmatics.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ting Fan Leung"", ids = ""4051377""); list(name = ""Man Fung Tang"", ids = ""47605203""); list(name = ""Tak Chi Liu"", ids = ""12010873""); list(name = ""Alice P.

8ee7b162f65066e97275390e0a9417c5c6b14403,Influence of mass resolution on species matching in accurate mass and retention time (AMT) tag proteomics experiments.,"Diverse mass spectrometric instruments have been used to provide data for accurate mass and retention time (AMT) tag proteomics analyses, including ion trap, quadrupole time-of-flight, and Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS). An important attribute of these instruments, beside mass accuracy, is their spectral resolution. In fact, the ability to separate peaks with close m/z values is likely to play a major role in enabling species identification and matching in analyses of very complex proteomics samples. In FTMS, resolution is directly proportional to the detection period and can therefore be easily tuned. We took advantage of this feature to investigate the effect of resolution on species identification and matching in an AMT tag experiment. Using an Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast protein extract as prototypical 'real-life' sample, we have compared the number of detected features, the optimal mass tolerance for species matching, the number of matched species and the false discovery rate obtained at various resolution settings. It appears that while the total number of matches is not significantly affected by a reduction of resolution in the range investigated, the confidence level of identifications significantly drops as evidenced by the estimated false discovery rate.",2008,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christophe D Masselon"", ids = ""2182187""); list(name = ""Sylvie Kieffer-Jaquinod"", ids = ""1398090561""); list(name = ""Sabine BrugiÃ¨re"", ids = ""4146501""); list(name = ""VÃ©ronique Dupierris"", ids = ""2359364""); list(name = ""JÃ©rÃ´me Garin"", ids = ""4307509"")",955f11a95e42a9b80941280112f18065e8e68559; 6a17c7c44f2811b04a6257fbbc8c12b937a8bb8f; a9b6efd3ed97868097dcc49de076fa8290de72cd; 3a92fb647cbd1af7ef8855c49d058f76f456f3cc; 5ccbcde9ad0fcd55dd919d2dcb17ab8bfe2a06c1; 7b3bc8a6d71c30f63d931deba60c9c943b13182d,,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,22 7,"

5ea85e91f9dc04b1b92a81dee42db8dbe7615245,Deep-gKnock: nonlinear group-feature selection with deep neural network,"Feature selection is central to contemporary high-dimensional data analysis. Grouping structure among features arises naturally in various scientific problems. Many methods have been proposed to incorporate the grouping structure information into feature selection. However, these methods are normally restricted to a linear regression setting. To relax the linear constraint, we combine the deep neural networks (DNNs) with the recent Knockoffs technique, which has been successful in an individual feature selection context. We propose Deep-gKnock (Deep group-feature selection using Knockoffs) as a methodology for model interpretation and dimension reduction. Deep-gKnock performs model-free group-feature selection by controlling group-wise False Discovery Rate (gFDR). Our method improves the interpretability and reproducibility of DNNs. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior power and accurate gFDR control compared with state-of-the-art methods.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Guangyu Zhu"", ids = ""145377023""); list(name = ""Tingting Zhao"", ids = ""1732354"")",,1116fbd784e20a032e90251ad34f7e5660df0ae9; a32c1089581ad7acf69576e52ce1b388192542f9; 7e757b9fabbf0d4adc6fe4d2c6853fa78242cafe; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff; 7ccc073c58f9be247eaa56bae37bea652c17ce29; 6e5078293a77d8e45503606eefd43ebe1226251a; 5f5dc5b9a2ba710937e2c413b37b053cd673df02; 5dce87311f354289e990be81aba6bb1adc874746; 0e40441cebb03fa4df6fad43ef5ff592e34c479b; 6a926103d431026fedda012d065e8695e139f8a2; 07c4e5120d9d4356f5d39371a689d20425a9c6f7; af6be7318a838c6aaf2d75ac995366ee4b72822c; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 41fdbe1c7e138a27b181984fd7bfc7152248ac29; d98ef875e2cbde3e2cc8fad521e3cbfe1bddbd69; f99ab20ae5674ad394086b1901fac654faf28a52; bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87; 45e55e460864ac2c9639d7a673406fa64f6751a8; 674b70b8f5c1115ed6c79b1325fc2cbb09ab019c; 3daa1216f7e6f7118ecc52c5f453d05891214bab; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 4de1b2ffb2a30b4ccf12b855bf849a89f056bd5b; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5,ArXiv,abs/1905.10013,
d6c71bde0fe39d8e46bf999ae3d80b1f12745263,Proteomics profiling of arginine methylation defines PRMT5 substrate specificity,"Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze arginine methylation on both chromatin-bound and cytoplasmic proteins. Accumulating evidence supports the involvement of PRMT5, the major type II PRMT, in cell survival and differentiation pathways that are important during development and in tumorigenesis. PRMT5 is an attractive drug target in various cancers, and inhibitors are currently in oncological clinical trials. Nonetheless, given the complex biology of PRMT5 and its multiple nonhistone substrates, it is paramount to fully characterize these dynamic changes in methylation and to link them to the observed anticancer effects to fully understand the functions of PRMT5 and the consequences of its inhibition. Here, we used a newly established pipeline coupling stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) with immunoenriched methyl peptides to globally profile arginine monomethylation and symmetric dimethylation after PRMT5 inhibition by a selective inhibitor. We adopted heavy methyl SILAC as an orthogonal validation method to reduce the false discovery rate. Through in vitro methylation assays, we validated a set of PRMT5 targets identified by mass spectrometry and provided previously unknown mechanistic insights into the preference of the enzyme to methylate arginine sandwiched between two neighboring glycines (a Gly-Arg-Gly, or â€œGRG,â€ sequence). Our analysis led to the identification of previously unknown PRMT5 substrates, thus both providing insight into the global effects of PRMT5 and its inhibition in live cells, beyond chromatin, and refining our knowledge of its substrate specificity.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniele Musiani"", ids = ""47720432""); list(name = ""Jabez Bok"", ids = ""51104169""); list(name = ""Enrico Massignani"", ids = ""66748506""); list(name = ""Liling Wu"", ids = ""47767604""); list(name = ""Tommaso Tabaglio"", ids = ""10247909""); list(name = ""Marica Rosaria Ippolito"", ids = ""91905767""); list(name = ""Alessandro Cuomo"", ids = ""3989587""); list(name = ""Umut Ozbek"", ids = ""5804733""); list(name = ""Habiba Zorgati"", ids = ""14817940""); list(name = ""Umesh Ghoshdastider"", ids = ""2522626""); list(name = ""Robert C Robinson"", ids = ""4323295""); list(name = ""Ernesto Guccione"", ids = ""3574193""); list(name = ""Tiziana Bonaldi"", ids = ""4504288"")",7d990f5803b52ca6c3bbc48ff649685bdc1a485a; 5df8010d4a6eb01851aa6760c3cca4b46b562271; 69c81cfb5779a3d0dd6f4912d230188578b7ff61; ccdebc7e387a38044f9ebf8387811d87671a8c69; aa491a8cdc715c865f9f7ca3ded41b4aaa9d795f; 0eaa76dd153d5abbd3dc939e7a2398d327fe2c35; 3a921d4a0d703b3b89b3b1e719b5d6ae978eba21; 05d480b81c3898d53932de65d9ddfbc08f2b22a6; 16674928872d263d3437b07454ab09a147941825,20091fa97cb31b0b84da71ca44d1d47c5fbe5c20; 4f71df0865645857d5a6e826fa5901d6b4ec6c0e; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 84cc20b1c5bce16c649f25793a99ab87b2a74ab7; 7622b0048cf8c047c5b6c49a5293a5c20392043e; 162d469d8e73be034df4f0a4073e51dd98206f41; 157f5e000f9b6402b63d4f9da92b2d2637725c9f; 1b72b908c6dc60400256a61921836095cdb45b04; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; da62779fe7866107ff0256462eb645d16198ad74; fc30910a8bf8daa3256284580b1dfe98b32d3559; e47b116ad942fffb241a7727c3a33ac97ef7e0eb; 1dbb2126c29873a946edbd68916048899acb5bcf; fa69e5e6d21650daa286ed936af9c53d1aca00df; c171eb893d7e4d059f869b9af4f03fa20482c078; 869a8d3e33629e1d6aa4ed012f5bc5672be36dc5; 592017022550753b70a20ef8b6b8f376fbf54037; b1aae8e6b1162e7439a5debc2f98c84e28855e5b; b89008ee33a6a3d3443cf3d14f56a14a3cc1ebb7; 6a7789044f5a33d219980e0f2552509e4ec2f125; 16fb92e26a6fa7b177c3f7006815de43d1905af5; d038d7acea15ed1a4454ed47f53da7135415b8a4; db460e9b5f8b8d1e9896e1ce5cc124e67d53ce1a; 499f05ee78164055414e9168bb9b37179ec8492e; 5df2e793d47d5a52a76594c498008a082406f1c8; ad3c495ac05d7485cef090fb031b2bcdc0c18a88; c1ed5597fc3b63e0479420afc05ba585b4475be0; 0eea1f9a240733ebbf50b756a380364489039409; b81577f341bbb8c22d929a516cdb91f1de8cbb36; a6f9bb243bb4977857582ea32b70e6f8cbf6dd59; 5bed666dc4fec5e00c31c712228442e6dadd41a8; e8e83a1ce1877fdb7341f326d67903d82dbefa3f; 6cef0c611a27506aea9e9bf7674bdeb4ad2caca7; 3668e2e9b587bcb6b26a1042452248cceb11a409; faac8e7b52f0108673fbc001bed5ed50b92167c0; 450c0864a8ddbf7b363587cb2d92da593b7263ba; 4186c2b5f04c54c450b136c535f91fdae502db79; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; f77954e30151ed4de1d067f1b4b06baac1a45159; 0a0cec540c533c521e05799e34a8c0afcbd341bf; 4b85d69f96f2779b2ea98b84d864a3b241f19aaf; a5f7e75b83c2650e7f89ef966b4d0da4adcb4201; 82c521f275a5ef4ecb5d6b517d3bb83f081678be; d6b30f008ce22c623733aa440a1a3b2b847b9611; 50f15845aa4410e9b4c962b2c044f491e4f2b7a7; 80d2fb61279866a0acbf796b667c9215989251c0; 57120e527a4a5a4db6a6ea7ad6683bab8d4a73af; c1a1b294c2ee65f3942b1feee53dc968fdd0036b; b9aabfcb64ea774dc777a9211af6c4faaa45735e; f01faee8a02a1721e061d04e0f6169eb8682efb7; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; 53e46424a171087b80ddd5d73b3812a5d4213ab4; 9b0a6570caa314e5d6bf5989c46a0bad0dde21cd; 51bb4c056a7c539f2280ee2ac806af28379a803e; 7a3d95a23264145da3eb70e5ca349e49a7ee7d51; 65bfce183519df03b80fa03a0bdf9767cb650939; 60f351449fdc79ca7e922181c1c6f4b2a1a08b95; b66e65c026e613a36419945f0646597dc222a2c1; 67b0143119dce7b6d0c3bc771bc896588b3dcdef; acf8ac71f49ec01671ac9b3b8b6e7fa83df9a26f,Science Signaling,12,
8cf5af4042071c09439ea783dc485545cf519dbc,Statistical recoupling prior to significance testing in nuclear magnetic resonance based metabonomics.,"Significance testing is a crucial step in metabolic biomarker recovery from the metabolome-wide latent variables computed by multivariate statistical analysis. In this study we propose an algorithm based on the landscape of the covariance/correlation ratio of consecutive variables along the chemical shift axis to restore, prior to significance testing, the spectral dependency and recouple variables in clusters which correspond to physical, chemical, and biological entities: statistical recoupling of variables (SRV). Variables are associated into a series of clusters, which are then considered as individual objects for the control of the false discovery rate. Compared to classical procedures, it is found that SRV allows efficient recovery of statistically significant metabolic variables. The proposed SRV method when associated with the Benjamini-Yekutieli correction retains a low level of significant variables in the noise areas of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, close to that observed using the conservative Bonferroni correction (false positive rate), while also allowing successful identification of statistically significant metabolic NMR signals in cases where the classical procedures of Benjamini-Yekutieli and Benjamini-Hochberg (false discovery rate) fail. This procedure improves the interpretability of latent variables for metabolic biomarker recovery.",2009,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Benjamin J.

Given the need for powerful testing procedures, and the attendant danger of false positives in multiple testing, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) controlling procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) has become a popular tool. When simultaneously testing hypotheses, suppose that R rejections are made, of which Fp are false positives. The Benjamini and Hochberg procedure ensures that the expectation of Fp/R is bounded above by some pre-specified proportion. In practice, the procedure is applied to a single experiment. In this paper we investigate the across-experiment variability of the proportion Fp/R as a function of three experimental parameters. The operational characteristics of the procedure when applied to dependent hypotheses are also considered.",2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Gerwyn Green"", ids = ""47426309""); list(name = ""Peter J Diggle"", ids = ""145785254"")",5485a22413065bda8e400588c1cee3051970e8eb; 0b7a7e69fbb47be48cb98589bf7cfea6ce549348; f0f4260401c2c69347e9394a1e5452348495a9a1; e9621151b347b2e7cf9b483ea2f80382999d113b; 4db95c17951a9a4ea0ecc62eeb6119866bfacd1f; f06a67e8d0048ec8f7c3298952cf4f0bb451f307; 2e75470add464cafc5a74a725778ab8bb37b6f6f; 621261c313f63f9a24275e347010178ad7ae40f4; 0bee2a1b036e974f6a1319d2227be7009357976d; a04a09adb82c1863e449724ad191c4d7b178a166; 678ee957c9b094955cc69e746214f685ee081d0e; 0d369a17a66e46f7a21b0420893447568fddde36; 33c61e40f0f1d5ffaef4b6942855be7437dba9ee; 01f95f5faeb820ff0affb86ef21598361ead833b; 0cbabe817e2ed5508177699af7a2e6777f1e5f22; 7475b4c579e121d9cd207d739ebacb6a3f351324; 396e8909b355a6da9ef1a25ceb4249ec38782dd6; 187573936a0efaab31d7a355ab6f27348b68bc14; d6b673566673f7940a10be923560b56963165b11; 2efac089b6dd845dbf26771f0fe34dd8b1d4ffed; 59ff8f7988d1c21d85b737fe5c4836f6b9f575f3; f4a50ca855d6659f4e653613f046348f531395c9; afa48de115c2af5d3dd06509a7b375d3a4e413b2; f6530fce3bba502e03c3a5626f3ef46c95d71951; 71e8e17f265ee74c1f9b95c21ee7d6b5bd1a4791; 54404f9d315658c976d1ae20c02286b68b01e189; e37c8acea9e807e2725c2b13b7d2673143229601; 040c303c7210e3d58def933831a559b6ddcf8c31; be70c3138e8a66ee5fff3911dbd47e646f91e583; 892f82a00481a70ece6d6517bb96e01e36d83104; 6223696f4a0a23f000ed6e89dccadc92323c3670; b716a2d1e26b165bce63208bec423e9059c98de9; e991dd933e409de14bb00240209d445a5f398ce7; 4ff26050a6cbd3bd0c2904e6d6bbe1b312eb355a; 1d0c559f64e22f4aaeda63983508e61115586f27; 73bac04b48882372ced01972c27588e8faa2690b; 35aaa29d5bac7d9bd55be0a955d180422b6a9c33; cd2dd700fac311cf1e6e283a0e74602da84a7cb2; 376b01197da2dcfb3cca31d1dd0e05775aa1451b; 0f120c22c0b058c8bb8382051f8079aa0bf33841; 5d55a5ab675311f79386fc8d6e764b20c5f51b67; 8d583142b373587439eba0e03faea2fc493f26dc,156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 10ab0830336e3b204202f47aa0fb63a813e3dc71; c9307fb63835f38bc47eeda0b907ef4b866b0ee9; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; a03e6e5b81637b34f9a9a446f0a3158a64befe96; f3adbd4737cec23e88fd0906ecb56e2fbb46e20d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 256f29267c2317228f6a7b65d698326f0a285e36; 1f1b750baf5b0fa427c5b38379cdcc8d70634d36; 05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,6,

Proteomics techniques have been particularly effective in studying protein phosphorylation, where tens of thousands of new sites have been recently discovered in all domains of life. Such massive discovery of new sites has been facilitated by progress in affinity enrichment techniques, high-throughput analytical platforms that couple liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and also powerful computational tools that assign peptides to tandem mass spectra. In this work we focus on computational protocols for identifying phosphoproteins, phosphopeptides, and phosphosites. Although the current tools already provide solid results, most methods have not been tuned to exploit particular sequence and physicochemical properties of phosphopeptides or the peculiarities of their fragment spectra. Therefore, novel algorithms can be designed to increase the sensitivity of phosphosite identification. Here we describe a machine learning-based method that improves the identification of phosphopeptides in LC-MS/MS experiments. Our algorithm is applied as a post-processing step to a standard database search. It assigns a probability score to each peptide-spectrum match (PSM) corresponding to a phosphopeptide, based on the sequence and spectral features of the peptide and its assigned fragment spectra as well as the biological propensity of particular residues in the peptide to be phosphorylated. The algorithm is based on a simple but robust logistic regression model and is used together with a conventional search engine (here, MASCOT) to filter out the PSMs with the lowest probability of being correctly identified. Our protocol was tested on two large phosphoproteomics data sets on which it increased the number of identified phosphopeptides by 10-15% compared to the conventional scoring algorithms at the same false discovery rate threshold of 1%.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sujun Li"", ids = ""2688444""); list(name = ""Randy J.

b20f0164f8c299a6f72aad10381a050c2f4be879,Alteration of the lipid profile in lymphomas induced by MYC overexpression.,"Overexpression of the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) oncogene is one of the most commonly implicated causes of human tumorigenesis. MYC is known to regulate many aspects of cellular biology including glucose and glutamine metabolism. Little is known about the relationship between MYC and the appearance and disappearance of specific lipid species. We use desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI), statistical analysis, and conditional transgenic animal models and cell samples to investigate changes in lipid profiles in MYC-induced lymphoma. We have detected a lipid signature distinct from that observed in normal tissue and in rat sarcoma-induced lymphoma cells. We found 104 distinct molecular ions that have an altered abundance in MYC lymphoma compared with normal control tissue by statistical analysis with a false discovery rate of less than 5%. Of these, 86 molecular ions were specifically identified as complex phospholipids. To evaluate whether the lipid signature could also be observed in human tissue, we examined 15 human lymphoma samples with varying expression levels of MYC oncoprotein. Distinct lipid profiles in lymphomas with high and low MYC expression were observed, including many of the lipid species identified as significant for MYC-induced animal lymphoma tissue. Our results suggest a relationship between the appearance of specific lipid species and the overexpression of MYC in lymphomas.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Livia S Eberlin"", ids = ""2216795""); list(name = ""Meital Gabay"", ids = ""50287016""); list(name = ""Alice C.

We therefore investigated the associations between 80 cardiovascular proteins and the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). Methods We used a discovery/replication approach in two independent community-based cohorts of elderly patients: the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (nâ€‰=â€‰662; mean age 78 years) and the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (nâ€‰=â€‰757; mean age 75 years; 51% women). A proteomic chip with a panel of 80 plasma proteins associated with different aspects of cardiovascular disease was analysed. In the discovery cohort, we used a false discovery rate of 5% to take into account the multiple statistical testing. Nominal p values were used in the replication. Results Higher levels of T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-1, placenta growth factor, growth/differentiation factor-15, urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor and kallikrein-11 were robustly associated with a higher ACR in both cohorts in multivariable linear regression models adjusted for sex, established cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive treatment, prevalent cardiovascular disease and glomerular filtration rate (pâ€‰<â€‰0.02 for all). All associations were also significant in separate analyses of patients without diabetes. Conclusions We discovered and replicated associations between ACR and five cardiovascular proteins involved in tubular injury, atherosclerosis, endothelial function, heart failure, inflammation, glomerulosclerosis and podocyte injury.

20d9e7ee035c3f45f089ce0fc9f24fee7d0578ed,Mapping of quantitative trait loci for lactation persistency traits in German Holstein dairy cattle.,"A whole genome scan to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for persistency of milk yield (PMY), persistency of fat yield (PFY), persistency of protein yield (PPY) and persistency of milk energy yield (PEY) was performed in a granddaughter design in the German Holstein dairy cattle population. The analysis included 16 paternal half-sib families with a total of 872 bulls. The analysis was carried out for the first lactation and for the first three lactations combined using univariate weighted multimarker regression. Controlling the false discovery rate across traits and data sets at a level of 0.15 and treating the four persistency traits as different traits revealed 27 significant QTL. A total of 12 chromosomes showed significant QTL effects on a chromosomewise basis. The DGAT1 effect was highly significant for PPY and protein yield. A haplotype analysis using results of previous studies of the same design revealed a co-segregation of various persistency QTL and QTL affecting health traits like dystocia and stillbirth and functional traits like non-return rate 90 and somatic cell score.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""B.

Because early response to antipsychotics represents a sufficiently reliable index of the subsequent treatment response in patients with schizophrenia, we undertook a real-world, genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the aim of identifying genetic predictors of response to risperidone after 2 weeks in 86 patients with schizophrenia. Limited to the associations reaching significance in the GWAS, confirmatory analysis relative to risperidone response over 9 months was also designed involving 97 patients (European only) enroled in the CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) genetic substudy. The GWAS revealed a significant association (false discovery rate 0.02) of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2133450 inside the GRM7 gene with Emsleyâ€™s positive domain derived from the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Patients with the rs2133450 CC genotype presented poorer improvement in the positive domain over 2 weeks, with odds ratios of 12.68 (95% CI, 3.51â€“45.76) and 6.95 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.37â€“20.37) compared with patients with the AA and AC genotypes, respectively. Compared with A homozygotes, rs2133450 C homozygotes enroled in the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis showed less improvement in Emsleyâ€™s positive, excited and depression domains, positive and general PANSS subtypes, and total PANSS after 9 months of treatment with risperidone. The original GWAS and the CATIE-derived confirmatory analysis support the proposal that the rs2133450 may have translational relevance as a predictor of response to risperidone.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Emilio Sacchetti"", ids = ""6977634""); list(name = ""Chiara Magri"", ids = ""49328563""); list(name = ""Alessandra Minelli"", ids = ""3508358""); list(name = ""Paolo Valsecchi"", ids = ""2713944""); list(name = ""Mercedes Traversa"", ids = ""145608042""); list(name = ""Stefano Calza"", ids = ""50050777""); list(name = ""A.

c301c5c3c07512e91368d9e78fd5b64a50d86ebc,Meta-Analysis of Drosophila Circadian Microarray Studies Identifies a Novel Set of Rhythmically Expressed Genes,"Five independent groups have reported microarray studies that identify dozens of rhythmically expressed genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Limited overlap among the lists of discovered genes makes it difficult to determine which, if any, exhibit truly rhythmic patterns of expression. We reanalyzed data from all five reports and found two sources for the observed discrepancies, the use of different expression pattern detection algorithms and underlying variation among the datasets. To improve upon the methods originally employed, we developed a new analysis that involves compilation of all existing data, application of identical transformation and standardization procedures followed by ANOVA-based statistical prescreening, and three separate classes of post hoc analysis: cross-correlation to various cycling waveforms, autocorrelation, and a previously described fast Fourier transform-based technique. Permutation-based statistical tests were used to derive significance measures for all post hoc tests. We find application of our method, most significantly the ANOVA prescreening procedure, significantly reduces the false discovery rate relative to that observed among the results of the original five reports while maintaining desirable statistical power. We identify a set of 81 cycling transcripts previously found in one or more of the original reports as well as a novel set of 133 transcripts not found in any of the original studies. We introduce a novel analysis method that compensates for variability observed among the original five Drosophila circadian array reports. Based on the statistical fidelity of our meta-analysis results, and the results of our initial validation experiments (quantitative RT-PCR), we predict many of our newly found genes to be bona fide cyclers, and suggest that they may lead to new insights into the pathways through which clock mechanisms regulate behavioral rhythms.",2007,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kevin P.

bd74b85df591ddb6902b045b70c71094d743175d,Alterations in immune and renal biomarkers among workers occupationally exposed to low levels of trichloroethylene below current regulatory standards.,"OBJECTIVES
The occupational exposure limit for trichloroethylene (TCE) in different countries varies from 1 to 100 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA). Many countries currently use 10 ppm as the regulatory standard for occupational exposures, but the biological effects in humans at this level of exposure remain unclear. The objective of our study was to evaluate alterations in immune and renal biomarkers among workers occupationally exposed to low levels of TCE below current regulatory standards.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study of 80 healthy workers exposed to a wide range of TCE (ie, 0.4-229 ppm) and 96 comparable unexposed controls in China, and previously reported that TCE exposure was associated with multiple candidate biological markers related to immune function and kidney toxicity. Here, we conducted further analyses of all of the 31 biomarkers that we have measured to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of changes in the subgroup of workers (n=35) exposed to <10â€‰ppm TCE compared with controls.


RESULTS
Six immune biomarkers (ie, CD4+ effectorâ€‰memory T cells, sCD27, sCD30, interleukin-10, IgG and IgM) were significantly decreased (% difference ranged from -16.0% to -72.1%) and one kidney toxicity marker (kidney injury molecule-1, KIM-1) was significantly increased (% difference: +52.5%) among workers exposed to <10â€‰ppm compared with the control group. These associations remained noteworthy after taking into account multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (ie, <0.20).


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that occupational exposure to TCE below 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA may alter levels of key markers of immune function and kidney toxicity.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kyoung-Mu Lee"", ids = ""5389020""); list(name = ""Luoping Zhang"", ids = ""36466899""); list(name = ""Roel C H Vermeulen"", ids = ""144756664""); list(name = ""Wei Hu"", ids = ""145066189""); list(name = ""Bryan A Bassig"", ids = ""6660066""); list(name = ""Jason Wong"", ids = ""83076675""); list(name = ""Chuangyi Qiu"", ids = ""40517991""); list(name = ""Mark P.

0fc85dcb12bf5f12d43d5b76e791d6539e524965,Uncovering robust patterns of microRNA co-expression across cancers using Bayesian Relevance Networks,"Co-expression networks have long been used as a tool for investigating the molecular circuitry governing biological systems. However, most algorithms for constructing co-expression networks were developed in the microarray era, before high-throughput sequencing-with its unique statistical properties-became the norm for expression measurement. Here we develop Bayesian Relevance Networks, an algorithm that uses Bayesian reasoning about expression levels to account for the differing levels of uncertainty in expression measurements between highly- and lowly-expressed entities, and between samples with different sequencing depths. It combines data from groups of samples (e.g., replicates) to estimate group expression levels and confidence ranges. It then computes uncertainty-moderated estimates of cross-group correlations between entities, and uses permutation testing to assess their statistical significance.

832817446304e86ea44b0a2b05e8ac6c204bd113,Leveraging Novel Statistical Methods And Big Data To Improve Imaging Genetics,"Overall Abstract Background The brain is a highly heritable organ with obvious associations to psychiatric diseases. Despite initial hype at the beginning of this century, it has been difficult to find brain related genotype-phenotype associations that replicate in independent samples. However, with the recent emergence of large consortia such as ENIGMA and ABCD, harmonized processing and analysis protocols across multiple sites allows for unprecedented power to detect genetically determined brain variation. In addition, novel statistical methods for big data, customized to the polygenic nature of brain phenotypes, have increased the potential to quantify variance due to genetic factors, and to identify genetic loci that replicate across GWAS samples. Here, we present the potential of combining large scale brain imaging data collection with novel biostatistical tools, and provide an update of the field related to the following topics: 1) Novel statistical approaches for imaging genetics (Thompson et al). This talk will propose novel statistical approaches for imaging genetics data derived from the field of Bayesian psychometrics. This talk will also cover how these methods will be applied to the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a nationwide 19 site NIH funded study that will recruit over 10,000 children aged 10-11 and followed for 10 years, with genetics, a twin component, and brain imaging every other year. The ABCD repository, which will be released to the public beginning December 1, 2017 and which will be of great value for imaging genetics studies, will be described in detail. The speaker, Dr. Thompson, is the Director of Biostatistics for the ABCD Consortium. 2) ENIGMA update - discoveries of novel brain associated gene variants (Hibar et al). Results from most recent GWAS of brain structure provides novel insight into common variants associated with cortical thickness and surface area using meta-analytic framework in more than 20,000 participants. Novel genome-wide significant variants were observed in the lateral occipital and pericalcerine gyri. These results provide insights into the common genetic architecture of the brain in the largest effort to date. 3) Bayesian approach to PGC - ENIGMA data reveals overlapping variants between schizophrenia and brain structure volumes (Smeland et al). Combined analysis of GWAS data using conditional false discovery rate methods provides increased power to detect overlapping genetic loci. Using this approach, we here identified genetic loci shared between schizophrenia and volumes of hippocampus, putamen and intracranial volume, suggesting novel molecular genetic mechanisms. 4) Imaging endophenotype revisit (Fan et al). Although neurodevelopmental processes seldom occur in discretized sets, imaging genetic analyses often rely on measures of morphologically defined region of interests (ROI). However, arbitrarily defined ROI can sometimes introduce bias. With larger training data available, it is now possible to extract reliable imaging features pertaining to genetic variations other than traditionally defined ROI. Here we demonstrate recent studies on learning new endophenotypes and the yield for discovering genetic influences on neuroanatomy. The learnt manifolds of anatomical structure can either be used for correcting the bias, e.g. population structure, or improving the power to detect genetic effects. This is important for extending imaging genetics research beyond caucasian samples.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Ole E.

91dc7240be61aaf33c1e7faeac75934aed1c8553,Use of high-resolution metabolomics for the identification of metabolic signals associated with traffic-related air pollution.,"BACKGROUND
High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) is emerging as a sensitive tool for measuring environmental exposures and biological responses. The aim of this analysis is to assess the ability of high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) to reflect internal exposures to complex traffic-related air pollution mixtures.


METHODS
We used untargeted HRM profiling to characterize plasma and saliva collected from participants in the Dorm Room Inhalation to Vehicle Emission (DRIVE) study to identify metabolic pathways associated with traffic emission exposures. We measured a suite of traffic-related pollutants at multiple ambient and indoor sites at varying distances from a major highway artery for 12â€¯weeks in 2014. In parallel, 54 students living in dormitories near (20â€¯m) or far (1.4â€¯km) from the highway contributed plasma and saliva samples. Untargeted HRM profiling was completed for both plasma and saliva samples; metabolite and metabolic pathway alternations were evaluated using a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) framework with pathway analyses.


RESULTS
Weekly levels of traffic pollutants were significantly higher at the near dorm when compared to the far dorm (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05 for all pollutants). In total, 20,766 metabolic features were extracted from plasma samples and 29,013 from saliva samples. 45% of features were detected and shared in both plasma and saliva samples. 1291 unique metabolic features were significantly associated with at least one or more traffic indicator, including black carbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05 for all significant features), after controlling for confounding and false discovery rate. Pathway analysis of metabolic features associated with traffic exposure indicated elicitation of inflammatory and oxidative stress related pathways, including leukotriene and vitamin E metabolism. We confirmed the chemical identities of 10 metabolites associated with traffic pollutants, including arginine, histidine, Î³â€‘linolenic acid, and hypoxanthine.


CONCLUSIONS
Using HRM, we identified and verified biological perturbations associated with primary traffic pollutant in panel-based setting with repeated measurement. Observed response was consistent with endogenous metabolic signaling related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and nucleic acid damage and repair. Collectively, the current findings provide support for the use of untargeted HRM in the development of metabolic biomarkers of traffic pollution exposure and response.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Donghai Liang"", ids = ""4196967""); list(name = ""Jennifer L.

041b9bb38b652838077625a199180b00a24e5e43,Monte Carlo randomization tests for large-scale abundance datasets on the GPU,"Statistical tests are often performed to discover which experimental variables are reacting to specific treatments. Time-series statistical models usually require the researcher to make assumptions with respect to the distribution of measured responses which may not hold. Randomization tests can be applied to data in order to generate null distributions non-parametrically. However, large numbers of randomizations are required for the precise p-values needed to control false discovery rates. When testing tens of thousands of variables (genes, chemical compounds, or otherwise), significant q-value cutoffs can be extremely small (on the order of 10(-5) to 10(-8)). This requires high-precision p-values, which in turn require large numbers of randomizations. The NVIDIA(Â®) Compute Unified Device Architecture(Â®) (CUDA(Â®)) platform for General Programming on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) was used to implement an application which performs high-precision randomization tests via Monte Carlo sampling for quickly screening custom test statistics for experiments with large numbers of variables, such as microarrays, Next-Generation sequencing read counts, chromatographical signals, or other abundance measurements. The software has been shown to achieve up to more than 12 fold speedup on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) when compared to a powerful Central Processing Unit (CPU). The main limitation is concurrent random access of shared memory on the GPU. The software is available from the authors.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""John L.

The composition of the small intestinal microbiota has not yet been characterized thoroughly using culture-independent techniques. We compared small intestinal microbial communities in patients with and without small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) using culture-dependent and culture-independent bacterial identification approaches.


METHODS
Small bowel aspirate and mucosal samples were collected from patients with suspected SIBO. The aspirates were cultured to diagnose SIBO, defined as â‰¥10 colony-forming units/mL coliform or â‰¥10 colony-forming units/mL upper aerodigestive tract bacteria. Bacteria in the aspirates and mucosa were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We compared small intestinal microbiome composition between groups with and without a culture-based SIBO diagnosis.


RESULTS
Analysis of the aspirate and mucosal microbial communities from 36 patients revealed decreased Î±-diversity but no differences in Î²-diversity in patients with SIBO compared with those without SIBO. There were no significant differences in the relative abundance of individual taxa from the aspirates or mucosa after adjustment for false discovery rate between patients with and without SIBO. Subgroup analysis revealed significant differences in mucosal Î²-diversity between the coliform and upper aerodigestive tract subgroups. Relative abundances of a mucosal Clostridium spp. (P = 0.05) and an aspirate Granulicatella spp. (P = 0.02) were higher in coliform SIBO vs non-SIBO subgroups. The microbial composition and relative abundance of multiple taxa significantly differed in the mucosal and aspirate specimens.

3ba96f0cc9d122a549e06e71457d79e75b027474,cn.MOPS: mixture of Poissons for discovering copy number variations in next-generation sequencing data with a low false discovery rate,"Quantitative analyses of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, such as the detection of copy number variations (CNVs), remain challenging. Current methods detect CNVs as changes in the depth of coverage along chromosomes. Technological or genomic variations in the depth of coverage thus lead to a high false discovery rate (FDR), even upon correction for GC content. In the context of association studies between CNVs and disease, a high FDR means many false CNVs, thereby decreasing the discovery power of the study after correction for multiple testing. We propose 'Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS' (cn.MOPS), a data processing pipeline for CNV detection in NGS data. In contrast to previous approaches, cn.MOPS incorporates modeling of depths of coverage across samples at each genomic position. Therefore, cn.MOPS is not affected by read count variations along chromosomes. Using a Bayesian approach, cn.MOPS decomposes variations in the depth of coverage across samples into integer copy numbers and noise by means of its mixture components and Poisson distributions, respectively. The noise estimate allows for reducing the FDR by filtering out detections having high noise that are likely to be false detections. We compared cn.MOPS with the five most popular methods for CNV detection in NGS data using four benchmark datasets: (i) simulated data, (ii) NGS data from a male HapMap individual with implanted CNVs from the X chromosome, (iii) data from HapMap individuals with known CNVs, (iv) high coverage data from the 1000 Genomes Project. cn.MOPS outperformed its five competitors in terms of precision (1-FDR) and recall for both gains and losses in all benchmark data sets. The software cn.MOPS is publicly available as an R package at http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/cnmops/ and at Bioconductor.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Guenter Klambauer"", ids = ""1994964"");

28cb6d2bf8b5f6738343a892f5e2b5176403ad77,Statistical Methods for Clinical Study Site Selection.,"BACKGROUND
The US Food and Drug Administration conducts on-site inspections and data audits through Bioresearch Monitoring program for assurance of the quality and integrity of data in the pre- and postapproval processes. It is important to inspect the study sites that are different compared with other sites in clinical studies and identify the problems related to those sites. Usually one cannot inspect all the sites in a clinical study because of limited resources, and statistical tools are needed to help in selecting sites for inspection.


METHODS
We propose two technical approaches, namely Fisher combination approach and likelihood ratio test (LRT) approach, for site selection, with each approach integrating the information obtained from a P value matrix. The proposed approaches produce site rankings, and the sites with highest rankings may be selected for inspection.


RESULTS
The application of the approaches is demonstrated through a hypothetical data set reflecting the pattern of the real data in a premarket approval submission for a diagnostic device. The proposed methods are shown, through extensive simulations, to control false discovery rate, while maintaining good sensitivity.


CONCLUSION
The proposed approaches will be useful for site selection process. However, limitations exist when only using the statistical approaches proposed here. In practice, investigators will select the site for inspection by considering the outputs from the statistical approaches along with other important factors. Future research topic is discussed to facilitate practical application of the approaches.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianjin Xu"", ids = ""3162046""); list(name = ""Lan Huang"", ids = ""145935117""); list(name = ""Zhihao Yao"", ids = ""1814272""); list(name = ""Zhiheng Xu"", ids = ""153008160""); list(name = ""Jyoti N.

a7d5dd84498c9fb7bd415f94a6f05e5eef64fd4c,Systematic expression profiling analysis mines dys-regulated modules in active tuberculosis based on re-weighted protein-protein interaction network and attract algorithm.,"About 90% of tuberculosis (TB) patients latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) show no symptoms, yet have a 10% chance in lifetime to progress active TB. Nevertheless, current diagnosis approaches need improvement in efficiency and sensitivity. The objective of this work was to detect potential signatures for active TB to further improve the understanding of the biological roles of functional modules involved in this disease. First, targeted networks of active TB and control groups were established via re-weighting protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). Candidate modules were detected from the targeted networks, and the modules with Jaccard score >0.7 were defined as attractors. After that, identification of dys-regulated modules was conducted from the attractors using attract method, Subsequently, gene oncology (GO) enrichment analyses were implemented for genes in the dys-regulated modules. We obtained 33 and 65 candidate modules from the targeted networks of control and active TB groups, respectively. Overall, 13 attractors were identified. Using the cut-off criteria of false discovery rate <0.05, there were 4 dys-regulated modules (Module 1, 2, 3, and 4). Based on the GO annotation results, genes in Modules 1, 2 and 4 were only involved in translation. Most genes in Module 1, 2 and 4 were associated with ribosomes. Accordingly, these dys-regulated modules might serve as potential biomarkers of active TB, facilitating the development for a more efficient, and sensitive diagnostic assay for active TB.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Hua Sun"", ids = ""35311208""); list(name = ""Yan Weng"", ids = ""50385538""); list(name = ""Ya-jie Zhang"", ids = ""46868110""); list(name = ""Xiang Yan"", ids = ""48090495""); list(name = ""Lei Guo"", ids = ""4818063""); list(name = ""Jia Wang"", ids = ""48094059""); list(name = ""Xin Song"", ids = ""153928310""); list(name = ""Ying Yuan"", ids = ""145054019""); list(name = ""Fuye Chang"", ids = ""89746867""); list(name = ""Chunling Wang"", ids = ""152745262"")",fc5c3b564f4e071676d5f6027bed3762d4721b3f; 7d32116223b5a1b00f9a7725203e80cfc9d813d7,f6841c262d25474fa6464bc2c640da0dda809329; 0bdfca163acb43d8e7aebec0d2c55cae883a7e0c; 4aeddaf7615770c90fe0a8da27fc24c3670eb9a5; 253257be59de477c86e533cb900228c850957c21; 56ea90d768f26fba20ee412ae82807ef1de421c2; 55b74f9603704c6ddbcd6b7ca3158a6e7f83b58b; b8453a6094c43e7facac68d8ef10cb805171522d; 3be876d0046cf3b0b350a4cd0d07522142e15498; 0754232834017bd61816b5b71fbbe2702892701d; ceff67a1c931e841aa5b35eb280886b0f5ecf0fb; a886f18f813e2167d00211c5b9ee29c4a877fefc; a6baea7df16128c0be4df25e68c0e137d400138f; 489357ce900208a7e6b82d99b3712f50106d18b7; 764651f8af72157a541cf3c4825481bfa6a02121; b6a45c1b9253ecf181a03122c0d6fb997880d455; 8a503a6898642a87dbd40a67ceb9897351d58841; ca5f91d62985bedf80d8912fab51d477a3e5f984; ef1b2162ca43755c9f1c37ae2a199d44f39baf4f; a2798842bcdd6b4b0c6218433043b513fd3a1ff1; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 9af043891d357539d31c3e005423d4c182c94ec1; a14c525586efa13f73607905a4f03f98c47e43fb; a48927298ce7bf17cc8703aa994495de58ad714d; 9965f9869d39d1375cf8d6329ea08001f579e973; 9a8617cf7849a277fc977d13ead3137546dcc70c; e73765cbcd7b939fc95a5b9370383f776bce9065; cb1273cb90484d50d75b3c1153c72b7ea189a827; 31344fb2e1513316de84dbf2fef5d722f7843835; cc12826019abf497cd70e85cbb31a39a670a36e4; c51b9817b24f191e7a45b71e4b790ac0194e1891; 5a2fc60ac512a030dea8aaedac4ef96b5ef051dd; 830fdb7b17cfa7b96693c41f04416c05ccbf34e6; 99899f29d6613e0a3b8426cbc78a8f1e7e24c9c5; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 0ac822a538b02a2838952c80c8362a11760d9832; f9da33d79f20aa0232bfcb1434b851dcc86f550e,Microbial pathogenesis,107,"

fac59b1accbda51a001a1fe0db48419cddff5010,"A closer look at evolution: Variants (SNPs) of genes involved in skin pigmentation, including EXOC2, TYR, TYRP1, and DCT, are associated with 25(OH)D serum concentration.","Vitamin D deficiency is common in the Caucasian population and is associated with increased incidence and unfavorable outcome of many diseases, including various types of cancer, infectious, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases. Individual factors that predispose for a person's vitamin D status, such as skin type, have been identified, but limited data exist on genetic determinants of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration. We have tested the hypothesis that variants of genes (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) involved in skin pigmentation are predictive of serum 25(OH)D levels. Serum 25(OH)D and SNPs (n = 960) related to genes with relevance for skin pigmentation (tyrosinase [TYR], TYR-related protein 1 [TYRP1], dopachrome tautomerase [DCT], oculocutaneous albinism II [OCA2], two pore segment channel 2 [TPCN2], solute carrier family 24 A4 [SLC24A4], solute carrier family 45 A2 [SLC45A2], agouti signalling peptide [ASIP], cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor [ATF1], microphthalmia-associated transcription factor [MITF], proopiomelanocortin [POMC], cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit beta [PRKACB], cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gamma [PRKACG], cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I-alpha regulatory subunit [PRKAR1A], cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-alpha regulatory subunit [PRKAR2A], cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit [PRKAR2B], tubulin beta-3 chain/melanocortin receptor 1 [TUBB3/MC1R], Cadherin-1 [CDH1], catenin beta 1 [CTNNB1], Endothelin 1 [EDN1], endothelin 3 [EDN3], endothelin receptor type B [EDNRB], fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2], KIT, KIT ligand [KITLG], nerve growth factor [NGF], interferon regulatory factor 4 [IRF4], exocyst complex component 2 [EXOC2], and tumor protein 53 [TP53]) were analyzed in a cohort of participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study (n = 2970). A total of 46 SNPs were associated (P <.05) with lower or higher serum 25(OH)D levels as compared with the total cohort (median, 15.5 ng/mL). Although 1 SNP in the EXOC2 gene reached the aimed significance level after correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate) and was associated with a Î”25(OH)D value more than 5.00 ng/mL, 11 SNPs located in the TYR (n = 4), PRKACG (n = 1), EDN1 (n = 3), TYRP1 (n = 1), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (n = 2) genes reached the aimed significance level after false discovery rate correction but were not associated with Î”25(OH)D value more than 5.00 ng/mL. We conclude that variants of genes involved in skin pigmentation are predictive of serum 25(OH)D levels in the Caucasian population. Our data indicate that out of the variants in 29 different genes analyzed, variants of 11 genes, including EXOC2, TYR, and TYRP1, have the highest impact on vitamin D status. Our results have a fundamental importance to understand the role of sunlight, skin pigmentation, and vitamin D for the human evolution.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roman Saternus"", ids = ""10762906""); list(name = ""Stefan Pilz"", ids = ""6725271""); list(name = ""Stefan GrÃ¤ber"", ids = ""2669317""); list(name = ""Marcus Kleber"", ids = ""50459269""); list(name = ""Winfried MÃ¤rz"", ids = ""144780440""); list(name = ""Thomas Vogt"", ids = ""1717432""); list(name = ""Joerg Reichrath"", ids = ""3794237"")",f9f5176b6ef4f09120211edfeae4a9025401c09b; 4060d9916838d5b02a853ee45656b04fd9502fcd; 492da622c8808dd70702ec992e6a600ee9150d64; 1d7ce1b0149ec2d63ef64b02941d46c5b50a26c4; 50709621374f3253e9e29612d450391ab3d4c318; 22c9d4884d36106e3b04aad6126ae023dce4dc57; 38373caa28f1b876dc9357a9ace1e0741b088c79; deaa70cb8a2120790ee912a68330abae105eba62; 9248af13d7503d2d99510504da936acad20d9929; 4bb9f68196271da2938b63eda4d0b0a777be8a13; 2ccb6910586ce074f6f6bf5c1b79e0bd4ce0c9d9; 2dee6cb465e16ee940eda1bb2dcec94989956787; d989b1a796359b349c8c950bf3b050ccfcc595f8; aa5e4593150bd1f6b1f189b40a972dd46f39c09e; 147be3092f189fbbe51d70fd28ddf4fe9dd38897; 69952ddb896471e88aa31dac22095f7a49a1fd15; 125ebe2eb66dedfc8e85cc850858ea8bd5a0c868,4a05f360d8493f44740fb80298c52d7386aa1ab8; 318608e0b81f0272574189ea37f31e315355db66; ae9879f6906beb561b7d9b99dedb1f5d2440af93; 49caba1cb5324f90aebc76d83b7086ff4b701c03; dc078827a247b938da832b9a95af24c9bc9f9ea7; ff53b70a6d157bfcf1e962f87a92d2ed5cfa88a8; ebefe1610206a6c6ed03aad65ad86bf989a63023; 45ca4d492564f35bf6408c531f762963bc6d8496; 76ada33eae0abcb5512fe0fa37a5d67c639fce67; 10a0c29c6c7bab3bdd6f839d2404a728d25cdb91; e5483673641f40a5a97f84fbf487d4ecd5a69933; 15b505d20ce74894c5f4b9907ff1435e84206cb5; c994a3057d22f30f2445b55951f334f96fb9058b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 75da52608fc3945e64b2555e30914c5f50ed743d; 143a922117f6725192dd6ff3eea7cf1ec2c2ad00; f629c20f03a9a4df373d7a70887e69e72836e662; dec6e68ab96291bf361d7a02306d556c92fd60a6; 5048d4879f09fb76898b52f64f27f1989eaa38c6; f1efe96bde863cab825b15ee723a5365657172ac; 680d5f75938c5a62b3f82b6cb343df33f079e385; 1217f30c3282c7bd13bc5eedf752caba9a274b7d; 1bdd6649a9a45de109f34cbacd8432247f3c46c6; fa25b257ed3f3527bb827aecbc413acc704b03a6; 02e382cd7af5cccb120cb1721154198ca999f2c2; 3e9c66ca4a48a949778c62df4098cb7c470f3efd,Endocrinology,156 1,"

9a32f70830a2615e3dc00177c0153d47e1157f72,Physical Activity After Stroke Is Associated With Increased Interhemispheric Connectivity of the Dorsal Attention Network,"Background. Attention is frequently impaired after stroke, and its impairment is associated with poor quality of life. Physical activity benefits attention in healthy populations and has also been associated with recovery after brain injury. Objective. We investigated the relationship between objectively measured daily physical activity, attention network connectivity, and attention task performance after stroke. We hypothesized that increased daily physical activity would be associated with improved attention network function. Methods. Stroke patients (n = 62; mean age = 67 years, SD = 12.6 years) and healthy controls (n = 27; mean age = 68 years, SD = 6 years) underwent cognitive testing and 7 minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging in the resting-state. Patients were tested 3 months after ischemic stroke. Physical activity was monitored with an electronic armband worn for 7 days. Dorsal and ventral attention network function was examined using seed-based connectivity analyses. Results. Greater daily physical activity was associated with increased interhemispheric connectivity of the superior parietal lobule in the dorsal attention network (DAN; P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). This relationship was not explained by stroke lesion volume. Importantly, stronger connectivity in this region was related to faster reaction time in 3 attention tasks, as revealed by robust linear regression. The relationship remained after adjusting for age, gray matter volume, and white matter hyperintensity load. Conclusions. Daily physical activity was associated with increased resting interhemispheric connectivity of the DAN. Increased connectivity was associated with faster attention performance, suggesting a cognitive correlate to increased network connectivity. Attentional modulation by physical activity represents a key focus for intervention studies.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michele Veldsman"", ids = ""3549373""); list(name = ""Leonid Churilov"", ids = ""144462966""); list(name = ""Emilio Werden"", ids = ""4019857""); list(name = ""Qi Li"", ids = ""47422590""); list(name = ""Toby B Cumming"", ids = ""3832489""); list(name = ""A.

c8bc519832afed2495defae46c5cb996adac7ee0,33 Buffalo (bubalus Bubalis) Embryos Produced by Hand-made Cloning and in Vitro Fertilization Differ in Their Global Transcriptome Profile.,"Although the blastocyst rate obtained with nuclear transferred (NT) embryos is higher than that obtained following in vitro fertilization (IVF) in buffalo, the live birth rate of NT embryos is <2% across different farm animal species compared with a birth rate >40% obtained with IVF embryos. This is believed to be due primarily to incomplete or incorrect nuclear reprogramming of the donor somatic cell by the oocyte, which results in aberrant embryonic gene expression. We compared the global transcriptome profile of buffalo blastocysts produced by hand-made cloning (HMC) and IVF using next-generation sequencing (NGS) for discovering transcripts that are differentially expressed between the 2 types of embryos. NT blastocysts were produced using fibroblast donor cells obtained from ear skin of a buffalo bull. The semen of the same bull was used for producing genetically half-identical IVF blastocysts. Total RNA was isolated from 3 pools of Day 8 NT and IVF blastocysts, with each pool containing 40 blastocysts. Complementary DNA library was prepared and subjected to NGS on Illumina HiSEqn 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The reads generated were aligned to Bos taurus reference genome, UMD 3.1. Differential expression analysis between the 2 blastocysts types at a minimum of 2-fold change revealed that 5557 transcripts were differentially expressed, of which 584 were unique to NT blastocysts, 709 were unique to IVF blastocysts, and 4264 were expressed in both types of blastocysts. Among these transcripts, at a significance level of P<0.05, 331 transcripts were differentially expressed between the 2 blastocyst types, of which 19 were unique, 188 were down-regulated, and 143 were up-regulated in NT blastocysts. One-way ANOVA with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to determine the statistically significant differentially expressed transcripts. Nine of the differentially expressed transcripts (at minimal 2-fold change, P<0.05), from different functional classes (RELN, NDRG1, SULT1A1, MAP1LC3A, MTHFD1L, PCBD1, PPA2, MGST1 and PRPH) were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis for validation of NGS data. Gene expression level of RELN, NDRG1, SULT1A1, MAP1LC3A, PPA2, MGST1, and PRPH was found to be up-regulated while that of MTHFD1L and PCBD1 was down-regulated (P<0.05) in NT embryos compared with IVF embryos. This pattern and the magnitude of relative gene expression level were found to be similar to that observed in NGS. These results indicate that the gene expression profile of NT embryos is very different from that of their IVF counterparts. Further analysis of these differentially expressed transcripts can help in identification of gene functional classes and pathways that are affected by the inefficient reprogramming of donor nuclei in NT embryos. Normalizing the expression of some of the differentially expressed genes may help in improving the cloning efficiency.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tanushri Jerath Sood"", ids = ""39557915""); list(name = ""S Viviyan"", ids = ""13066107""); list(name = ""Suresh Kumar Singla"", ids = ""4874454""); list(name = ""Manishi Mukesh"", ids = ""34299580""); list(name = ""Manmohan Singh Chauhan"", ids = ""46282140""); list(name = ""Radhey Sham Manik"", ids = ""47265429""); list(name = ""Prabhat Palta"", ids = ""6041888"")",d3df79bb64123fc56e208d8d8f80c4fe034a0c3a,,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",29 1,124

Although some studies have been carried out to evaluate the effects of the oviduct on spermatozoa, less is known about the effect of spermatozoa on the oviduct. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sperm on the transcriptome profile of the bovine oviduct after fixed-time AI (FTAI). Nellore cows submitted to FTAI were randomly inseminated using 8â€‰Ã—â€‰106 frozenâ€“thawed spermatozoa (sperm group, nâ€‰=â€‰9) or saline solution (control group, nâ€‰=â€‰9). Eighteen hours after FTAI, the cows were slaughtered, and the cells from oviducal isthmus were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen until transcriptome analysis. For RNA extraction, 3 pools of 3 oviducts/cows from each group were formed. Total RNA was extracted and the RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The transcription profiling from each group was performed by HiSEqn 2500 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). After sequencing, the data were analysed by edgeR software, and differential gene expression analysis between sperm and control group was performed using the generalized linear model (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). The P-value was adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR) Benjamini-Hochberg method, to avoid false positives. Moreover, using mRNA expression levels (log fold change and P-values) as coefficients, functional enrichment analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases. A total of 9,374 genes were found to be expressed in bovine oviducal isthmus, of which 219 genes were differentially expressed between sperm and control group. Differentially expressed genes genes were classified according to 3 major GO classifications, with 10 gene categories in molecular function, 3 gene categories in cellular component, and zero categories in biological process. In the molecular function category, genes related to calcium ion binding (nâ€‰=â€‰113), molecular transducer activity (nâ€‰=â€‰111), and receptor activity (nâ€‰=â€‰111), were predominant. For cellular component, the highest number of genes (nâ€‰=â€‰176) was related to extracellular space. Moreover, KEGG assignments were used to classify the functional annotations of the pathways genes to further understand the biological functions of the expressed genes. It was shown that steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, calcium signalling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, neuroactive ligant-receptor interaction, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules, coagulation and complement cascades, ovarian steroidogenesis, protein digestion and absorption and mineral absorption pathways had genes with higher or lower expression than the median of gene expression out of the tested category. The results suggested that bovine sperm affect the transcriptome profile of the bovine oviduct after FTAI. Moreover, based on the functional enrichment analysis, an effect of the sperm-oviduct interaction on some pathways analysed by GO and KEGG was identified.

Two-stage pilot and integrated designs are powerful tools for investigating large numbers of hypotheses. Asymptotically, optimal two-stage designs controlling the familywise error or false discovery rate are considered when costs and effect sizes per measurement differ between stages and total costs are constrained.


RESULTS
Depending on the cost and effect size ratios between the measurements, it is generally more powerful to apply two-stage procedures using one measurement method at both stages. For the practically relevant case that the same method is applied at both stages but designing the second-stage measurements raises extra costs, two-stage designs are more powerful than the single-stage design even for large costs ratios. The power of the optimal pilot and integrated two-stage designs generally are similar, however, the integrated approach is less sensitive even to severe design misspecifications in the planning phase.

In patients with CRSwNP, the present study performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses to characterize the transcriptome profiles of mRNAs and long nonâ€‘coding RNAs (lncRNAs). A total of 265Â differentially expressed lncRNAs and 994Â mRNAs were identified. The majority of upâ€‘ and downregulated differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in the biological process of 'signal transduction'. The most significantly enriched molecular function was 'protein binding' and the most significantly enriched cellular component was 'membrane'. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis led to identification of several significantly enriched pathways [false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05], including 'cytokineâ€‘cytokine receptor interaction' (FDR=3.94x1016) and 'cell adhesion molecules' (CAMs) (FDR=1.28x10â€‘5). Key differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including lncRNA XLOC_010280, which regulates chemokine (Câ€‘C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18) and inï¬‚ammation, and RP11â€‘798M19.6, which regulates polypeptide Nâ€‘acetylgalactosaminyltransferaseÂ 7 (GALNT7) and cell proliferation. Based on the results of reverse transcriptionâ€‘quantitative polymerase chain reaction, except for CCL8, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4â€‘like and GALNT7, the expression of 3Â other selected genes was consistent with the results of integrated analysis.

The advantage of the FDR over existing methods is that it selects more outperforming rules, which allows diversifying against model uncertainty. Persistence tests show that, even with the more powerful FDR technique, an investor would never have been able to select ex ante the future best-performing rules.

Assuming unimodal true peaks with finite support and Gaussian stationary ergodic noise, it is shown that the algorithm with Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg correction provides asymptotic strong control of the family wise error rate and false discovery rate, and is power consistent, as the search space and the signal strength get large, where the search space may grow exponentially faster than the signal strength. Simulations show that error levels are maintained for non-asymptotic conditions, and that power is maximized when the smoothing kernel is close in shape and bandwidth to the signal peaks, akin to the matched filter theorem in signal processing. The methods are illustrated in an analysis of electrical recordings of neuronal cell activity.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ariel Schwartzman"", ids = ""144666645""); list(name = ""Yulia Gavrilov"", ids = ""35134903""); list(name = ""Robert J.

af4b4cf76b50abfa59d00f5f688fa40bc266fb05,Defining genital tract cytokine signatures of sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis in women at high risk of HIV infection: a cross-sectional study.,"OBJECTIVES
Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) cause female genital tract inflammation. This inflammation, which is often present in the absence of symptoms, is associated with increased susceptibility to HIV infection. We aimed to evaluate genital cytokine profiles and the degree of inflammation associated with common STIs and BV.


METHODS
HIV-uninfected women (n=227) were screened for BV, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis. Concentrations of 42 cytokines in cervicovaginal lavages and 13 cytokines in plasma were measured using Luminex. Changes in cytokine profiles were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test, logistic regression and factor analysis. p Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate step-down procedure.


RESULTS
Women with chlamydia or gonorrhoea had the highest genital cytokine concentrations, with 17/42 and 14/42 cytokines upregulated compared with women with no infection, respectively. BV was associated with elevated proinflammatory cytokine concentrations, but lower chemokine and haematopoietic cytokine concentrations. HSV-2 reactivation was associated with lower levels of inflammation, while trichomoniasis did not cause significant differences in genital cytokine concentrations. Genital infections did not influence plasma cytokine concentrations. Although certain STIs, in particular chlamydia and gonorrhoea, were associated with high genital cytokine concentrations, only 19% of women with an STI/BV had clinical signs.


CONCLUSIONS
Chlamydia was associated with the highest genital cytokine levels, followed by gonorrhoea, HSV-2, trichomoniasis, and BV.

c8f37707b10a8f6fb35a77176205bbcc507c42aa,False discovery rate control is a recommended alternative toÂ Bonferroni-type adjustments in health studies.,"OBJECTIVES
Procedures for controlling the false positive rate when performing many hypothesis tests are commonplace in health and medical studies. Such procedures, most notably the Bonferroni adjustment, suffer from the problem that error rate control cannot be localized to individual tests, and that these procedures do not distinguish between exploratory and/or data-driven testing vs. hypothesis-driven testing. Instead, procedures derived from limiting false discovery rates may be a more appealing method to control error rates in multiple tests.


STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING
Controlling the false positive rate can lead to philosophical inconsistencies that can negatively impact the practice of reporting statistically significant findings. We demonstrate that the false discovery rate approach can overcome these inconsistencies and illustrate its benefit through an application to two recent health studies.


RESULTS
The false discovery rate approach is more powerful than methods like the Bonferroni procedure that control false positive rates. Controlling the false discovery rate in a study that arguably consisted of scientifically driven hypotheses found nearly as many significant results as without any adjustment, whereas the Bonferroni procedure found no significant results.


CONCLUSION
Although still unfamiliar to many health researchers, the use of false discovery rate control in the context of multiple testing can provide a solid basis for drawing conclusions about statistical significance.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark E.

6185314c7af947eb4e69c35782de3840bceca7b2,Estimating the Contribution of Proteasomal Spliced Peptides to the HLA-I Ligandome*,"Spliced peptides are short protein fragments spliced together in the proteasome by peptide bond formation. True estimation of the contribution of proteasome-spliced peptides (PSPs) to the global human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligandome is critical. A recent study suggested that PSPs contribute up to 30% of the HLA ligandome. We performed a thorough reanalysis of the reported results using multiple computational tools and various validation steps and concluded that only a fraction of the proposed PSPs passes the quality filters. To better estimate the actual number of PSPs, we present an alternative workflow. We performed de novo sequencing of the HLA-peptide spectra and discarded all de novo sequences found in the UniProt database. We checked whether the remaining de novo sequences could match spliced peptides from human proteins. The spliced sequences were appended to the UniProt fasta file, which was searched by two search tools at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. We find that 2-6% of the HLA ligandome could be explained as spliced protein fragments. The majority of these potential PSPs have good peptide-spectrum match properties and are predicted to bind the respective HLA molecules. However, it remains to be shown how many of these potential PSPs actually originate from proteasomal splicing events.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Roman Mylonas"", ids = ""5043805""); list(name = ""Ilan Beer"", ids = ""3060288""); list(name = ""Christian Iseli"", ids = ""3269164""); list(name = ""ChloÃ© Chong"", ids = ""40430852""); list(name = ""Hui-Song Pak"", ids = ""12967917""); list(name = ""David Gfeller"", ids = ""1784899""); list(name = ""George Coukos"", ids = ""78290104""); list(name = ""Ioannis Xenarios"", ids = ""51006145""); list(name = ""Markus MÃ¼ller"", ids = ""50098494""); list(name = ""Michal Bassani-Sternberg"", ids = ""1399878479"")",ed0e876cd38228a229f36cdc5f51487b671b42c6; 59e6366db47f709fc24e1b329c0703f02451cf60; ebdf195bb2c7aff0da94447649aa0f1627485ccb; 50d51928375c949a100e303cb8c0e9e0975f627a; b9173a14cf757cc10ab54716585dbe1a6ac69976; e70b92815f98cc8a8c9785eed6a416c76eabaa1d; 1cdac9c634ea1f0553e79dbfdc8c58e7a1e76285; 5524d879303bc5c05b6af42153a2fe825b28ae77; e8e5bbf6797a3cbd1aacbf582589bd04a77af495; 8801fb4edbf63502ba8dbdc2ac7e2e4e7ba41d65; de82872a53782ced0eb7b5264e548cbd4fc1f4e6,8cdd128e5b86cb42cf42885808c445e8fe55d131; a968620dcf399d7d7f89f98dc1d3da8c114dac8d; 8142fea2e604daa921263ab75c66d1d32fbef1c7; 30cbb466c2e0aeaca7d56e1982394c4d3592128a; d09c50f89c3e2650a1579d5ece8f1b9738e2c962; c071c9524e7c9040c3c0f5e228bae8fe483394fb; d0c26518c6fbb4145914561723db6d0fe89c4078; 1d4350efa9eaa0d9aa178482a10cdc261e5a41d2; a4c5dda96c9237eb9eef796ef4c343f98dc1e50b; 031d426c6e35947c6f0189ca1751d83e9ddabf50; ae4f4f0450017634f95c994630ebb1dde4e34d8a; 3767243e735b57b2f62632aebf1c1d13e629a6f5; eeccd666dc7129b6c7b49c8085509edfef23eed9; 2551f5f20953719f91d69344cd023d78ac591c4e; 5ae35403a24ab9f6dc0baa028e6153e10db832b4; 51a3055d0d2de24db9eb743a0aafad292f8f4cf7; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b99b4570815d3e4bf6d20a98d6bbeaa420d4e820; fa78d9e45cf1ab060d8bb11f04e94ad71831ea92; 39b271636949f358df86349d197b4fa6c848478d; 4e09cf2e449864c391918b538408355e53a7f17e; e6a7de99b73ae5e42c82a16ae3c284206c6534b1; a7a581f7f052570fa099dcb887b9934617760791; 0236653b06cb18cb05592f85330208383fdb7bfd; 3b3ad5eaddd5a970519b8c9b4097816fe374e8ec; fcfecfd9e216f2f2d0736625e7249af5d0ede908; ded6403e634a9fa620dc071c71149ca5632e217b; 1ed1f044ec85ebff2bf5fa93058d53d7cc474e52; 34ce08af37e23c467660c7230c4eca698a825a96; a94352cef40fbe745efdcd73b8f0bbd1a07da24e; 0f648316a88cdc828e8703f4d302bf3df797374d; ea786a976a1de4d5466d12e292618ebd76ec8f03; 433d810daa8c2280503d28203e5eece473409b89; 0426c1bf834073108c944530345761e901954441; 44e6ae980ee37d12c021e33d65c5af58e4c48c26,Molecular & Cellular Proteomics : MCP,17,2347 - 2357
61e45b702ee7317d3107e1ac2e47d773783efe51,A gene-signature progression approach to identifying candidate small-molecule cancer therapeutics with connectivity mapping,"BackgroundGene expression connectivity mapping has gained much popularity recently with a number of successful applications in biomedical research testifying its utility and promise. Previously methodological research in connectivity mapping mainly focused on two of the key components in the framework, namely, the reference gene expression profiles and the connectivity mapping algorithms. The other key component in this framework, the query gene signature, has been left to users to construct without much consensus on how this should be done, albeit it has been an issue most relevant to end users. As a key input to the connectivity mapping process, gene signature is crucially important in returning biologically meaningful and relevant results. This paper intends to formulate a standardized procedure for constructing high quality gene signatures from a userâ€™s perspective.ResultsWe describe a two-stage process for making quality gene signatures using gene expression data as initial inputs. First, a differential gene expression analysis comparing two distinct biological states; only the genes that have passed stringent statistical criteria are considered in the second stage of the process, which involves ranking genes based on statistical as well as biological significance. We introduce a â€œgene signature progressionâ€ method as a standard procedure in connectivity mapping. Starting from the highest ranked gene, we progressively determine the minimum length of the gene signature that allows connections to the reference profiles (drugs) being established with a preset target false discovery rate. We use a lung cancer dataset and a breast cancer dataset as two case studies to demonstrate how this standardized procedure works, and we show that highly relevant and interesting biological connections are returned. Of particular note is gefitinib, identified as among the candidate therapeutics in our lung cancer case study. Our gene signature was based on gene expression data from Taiwan female non-smoker lung cancer patients, while there is evidence from independent studies that gefitinib is highly effective in treating women, non-smoker or former light smoker, advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients of Asian origin.ConclusionsIn summary, we introduced a gene signature progression method into connectivity mapping, which enables a standardized procedure for constructing high quality gene signatures. This progression method is particularly useful when the number of differentially expressed genes identified is large, and when there is a need to prioritize them to be included in the query signature. The results from two case studies demonstrate that the approach we have developed is capable of obtaining pertinent candidate drugs with high precision.",2016,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qing Wen"", ids = ""145287271""); list(name = ""Chang Sik Kim"", ids = ""2974654""); list(name = ""Peter Hamilton"", ids = ""123314049""); list(name = ""Shu-Dong Zhang"", ids = ""47180861"")",42333fda0f2a0c8b941881f66f8ecbe346a544d5; c8ca5feb537c4e2c829da1d511b781bf4d26064f; 24f93b2ebe95bbe215deb21108d78ea3c214ad72,e5951513610cc5649516811717bd6648b4c2b499; c99675350f7cd04f8dac9868312f97b241318582; d7c79a1b47926ed5ea6645048717cd50c8da115a; 8ee5a53b763fcf8fc3b2dd93bcda232e239c4ce5; 40d26c53084a5c8ef66970e2016f436d00150a21; e6d8f8fad06ae5305af665e908a697d01ade1c59; da7418b0db4f1d11c8f2a4282deb59c8d9a26201; 804966fad365af4f9c7276dff95f83b07588a6d9; 7d83ad0544ecfc3921e5ef70a9f85017c237e147; 0e1f6b5b202c3da3481f06c9e85ee328474e11ee; e6a2b2fd9d8da47a1306b023e0ef5ebdd1f94f10; 14399f730010c8ac846e805d616c727ff791bcb3; bc9379d9bc576f5bd09b720075e9f96396987981; 9b512e10217682e9f5621d2467f7a9266cd18114; 935a658455e81729e9390673f1c310adae12594b; 4b822903e47fd5cb2ca965b89510f0922449410e; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; 2e39c86b27f849723e431a364c9ae27e89693d16; 37f2e1c2b39f2ada14a902fd7c103bbee8a6f687; 6f560e606f773f003bf121e348c8c026ab8546f5; 46ee1d51a830bf6ed6a67b9fb63794531fb206ab; 2cda9ec97d0963425d8eb06168bf47e8dd2f9a8f; d9b253d5700e2f442717e293f88335be27f25563; f011a5179bc6e34dffa8725634fa09799552e4ed; 0a6903c04eefc7a94eb681aef65bf167c9842ac4; 3f7f4980ae9bfebb73dff03ed0c14f9e31901548; b2b8f9ae9c48f7183fb2e52ed014ba5f048a8ad4; 7a5cffe11e7be474bdfdacc7f2fe8d94f8905f91; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 04010fa6437a5832397c80847b02698015b0dc4a; 424241312d7f21c4cbfa497255192f46f8bad7d5; 367fa7da38f0066ecb106aa1d4d313b7f293ecfa; 8ebf8debb3abd217c08bfd3b1e3f9fcb5988a488; 331df8c1a1c71ab369b83b6b8a28008c56daa40a; e2e09d9bfa7aba46d46a1c5b75a1966aebd34212; 4fea8f834591de8a3ae64d75a7d26e43b6a5906d,BMC Bioinformatics,17,

Perinatal probiotic ingestion has been shown to prevent atopic dermatitis (AD) in infancy in a number of randomised trials. The Probiotics in the Prevention of Allergy among Children in Trondheim (ProPACT) trial involved a probiotic supplementation regime given solely to mothers in the perinatal period and demonstrated a ~40% relative risk reduction in the cumulative incidence of AD at 2 years of age. However, the mechanisms behind this effect are incompletely understood. Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are abundant in mammalian milk and may influence the developing gastrointestinal and immune systems of newborn infants. The objectives of this study were to describe the miRNA profile of human breast milk, and to investigate breast milk miRNAs as possible mediators of the observed preventative effect of probiotics.


METHODS
Small RNA sequencing was conducted on samples collected 3 months postpartum from 54 women participating in the ProPACT trial. Differential expression of miRNA was assessed for the probiotic vs placebo and AD vs non-AD groups. The results were further analysed using functional prediction techniques.


RESULTS
Human breast milk samples contain a relatively stable core group of highly expressed miRNAs, including miR-148a-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-30d-5p, let-7b-5p and miR-200a-3p. Functional analysis of these miRNAs revealed enrichment in a broad range of biological processes and molecular functions. Although several miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed on comparison of the probiotic vs placebo and AD vs non-AD groups, none had an acceptable false discovery rate and their biological significance in the development of AD is not immediately apparent from their predicted functional consequences.


CONCLUSION
Whilst breast milk miRNAs have the potential to be active in a diverse range of tissues and biological process, individual miRNAs in breast milk 3 months postpartum are unlikely to play a major role in the prevention of atopic dermatitis in infancy by probiotics ingestion in the perinatal period.

0e9b958557458a4b39fbbc4fa0a8a0f1dc6642bc,Genome-wide association study for posthitis in the free-living population of European bison (Bison bonasus),"BackgroundAbout 5â€“6% of the European bison (Bison bonasus) males are affected by posthitis (necrotic inflammation of the prepuce) and die in the wild forest. Despite many years of study, pathogenesis of this disease has not yet been determined. The main aim of the study was to find SNP markers significantly associated with the incidence of posthitis and mine the genome for candidate genes potentially involved in the development of the disease.ResultsIt was shown that relatively small number of SNPs effects reached genome-wide significance after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Among 25 significant markers, the highest effects were found for two SNPs (rs110456748 and rs136792896) located at the distance of 23846Â bp and 37742Â bp, respectively, from OR10A3 gene (olfactory receptor genes), known to be involved in atopic dermatitis in humans. It was also observed that five other significant SNP markers were located in the proximity of candidate genes involved in severe diseases of skin tissue and cancer/tumour development of epithelial or testicular germ cells, which suggest their potential participation in the posthitis. The 25 investigated SNPs showed marked differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies between the healthy and affected bison groups.ConclusionsThe 2Â Mb region of the BTA15 chromosome is involved in genetic background of posthitis and should be closer examined to find causal mutations helpful in better understanding of the disease ethology and to control its incidence in the future.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Prof. Lev Klebanov and Dr. Fyodor Kondrashov.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kamil OleÅ„ski"", ids = ""5162926""); list(name = ""MaÅ‚gorzata Tokarska"", ids = ""6936658""); list(name = ""Dorota M.

6bc5b2b6b7e49f96ce2992f02fcd24c60c020e14,Genome-wide analysis of genetic predisposition to Alzheimerâ€™s disease and related sex disparities,"BackgroundAlzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. AD is mainly considered a complex disorder with polygenic inheritance. Despite discovering many susceptibility loci, a major proportion of AD genetic variance remains to be explained.MethodsWe investigated the genetic architecture of AD in four publicly available independent datasets through genome-wide association, transcriptome-wide association, and gene-based and pathway-based analyses. To explore differences in the genetic basis of AD between males and females, analyses were performed on three samples in each dataset: males and females combined, only males, or only females.ResultsOur genome-wide association analyses corroborated the associations of several previously detected AD loci and revealed novel significant associations of 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside the chromosome 19q13 region at the suggestive significance levelÂ of p <â€‰5Eâ€“06. These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions. Of these, 17 genes were not associated with AD at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations by previous genome-wide association studies. Also, the chromosomal regions corresponding to 8 genes did not contain any previously detected AD-associated SNPs with p < 5Eâ€“06. Our transcriptome-wide association and gene-based analyses revealed that 26 genes located in 20 chromosomal regions outside chromosome 19q13 had evidence of potential associations with AD at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Of these, 13 genes/regions did not contain any previously AD-associated SNPs at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations. Most of the newly detected AD-associated SNPs and genes were sex specific, indicating sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD. Also, 7 of 26 pathways that showed evidence of associations with AD in our pathway-bases analyses were significant only in females.ConclusionsOur findings, particularly the newly discovered sex-specific genetic contributors, provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of AD and can advance our understanding of its pathogenesis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alireza Nazarian"", ids = ""5226014""); list(name = ""Anatoliy I.

c1829ce4eb8568979b520f1bc8df1a66cbcf96dc,(187) Associations between Pain Interference and Brain Volume in Community-Dwelling Older Adults,"Pain is common in older individuals often interfering with daily function, and pain interference is a common proxy for measuring physical functioning in this population. Although both pain and aging are associated with changes to brain volume, relatively few studies have examined the association between pain interference and brain volume among older individuals. As part of the Neuromodulatory Examination of Pain Across the Lifespan (NEPAL) study at the University of Florida, older individuals 60 to 93 years old (n=49, 69% female) filled out demographic and pain questionnaires followed by a structural 3-Tesla MRI scan. FreeSurfer 6.0.0 was used for preprocessing, quality control, and for volumetric parcellation generation. FreeSurfer Query, Design, Estimate, Contrast (QDEC) processing stream was used for statistical analysis controlling for multiple comparisons with gender as a nuisance covariate. Higher pain interference was associated with smaller volume in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, rostral middle frontal cortex, post-central cortex, superior temporal cortex, and precuneus but larger volume in the superior frontal and parstriangularis cortices (False Discovery Rate p's",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""David Lussier"", ids = ""48653238""); list(name = ""Per Lysne"", ids = ""145334399""); list(name = ""Joseph L.

35740cdbb891b8885f89ed236f0be749e204aa31,Deep Sequencing the Transcriptome Reveals Seasonal Adaptive Mechanisms in a Hibernating Mammal,"Mammalian hibernation is a complex phenotype involving metabolic rate reduction, bradycardia, profound hypothermia, and a reliance on stored fat that allows the animal to survive for months without food in a state of suspended animation. To determine the genes responsible for this phenotype in the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) we used the Roche 454 platform to sequence mRNA isolated at six points throughout the year from three key tissues: heart, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue (WAT). Deep sequencing generated approximately 3.7 million cDNA reads from 18 samples (6 time points Ã—3 tissues) with a mean read length of 335 bases. Of these, 3,125,337 reads were assembled into 140,703 contigs. Approximately 90% of all sequences were matched to proteins in the human UniProt database. The total number of distinct human proteins matched by ground squirrel transcripts was 13,637 for heart, 12,496 for skeletal muscle, and 14,351 for WAT. Extensive mitochondrial RNA sequences enabled a novel approach of using the transcriptome to construct the complete mitochondrial genome for I. tridecemlineatus. Seasonal and activity-specific changes in mRNA levels that met our stringent false discovery rate cutoff (1.0 Ã— 10(-11)) were used to identify patterns of gene expression involving various aspects of the hibernation phenotype. Among these patterns are differentially expressed genes encoding heart proteins AT1A1, NAC1 and RYR2 controlling ion transport required for contraction and relaxation at low body temperatures. Abundant RNAs in skeletal muscle coding ubiquitin pathway proteins ASB2, UBC and DDB1 peak in October, suggesting an increase in muscle proteolysis. Finally, genes in WAT that encode proteins involved in lipogenesis (ACOD, FABP4) are highly expressed in August, but gradually decline in expression during the seasonal transition to lipolysis.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marshall Hampton"", ids = ""3220327""); list(name = ""Richard G Melvin"", ids = ""2265381""); list(name = ""Anne Kendall"", ids = ""6257348""); list(name = ""Brian Kirkpatrick"", ids = ""39596729""); list(name = ""Nichole T.

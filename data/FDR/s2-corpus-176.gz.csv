815aa0074f810b5444fa5deeec7b1d53c7d35727,Relaxing the Assumptions of Knockoffs by Conditioning,"The recent paper Candes et al. (2018) introduced model-X knockoffs, a method for variable selection that provably and non-asymptotically controls the false discovery rate with no restrictions or assumptions on the dimensionality of the data or the conditional distribution of the response given the covariates. The one requirement for the procedure is that the covariate samples are drawn independently and identically from a precisely-known (but arbitrary) distribution. The present paper shows that the exact same guarantees can be made without knowing the covariate distribution fully, but instead knowing it only up to a parametric model with as many as $\Omega(n^{*}p)$ parameters, where $p$ is the dimension and $n^{*}$ is the number of covariate samples (which may exceed the usual sample size $n$ of labeled samples when unlabeled samples are also available). The key is to treat the covariates as if they are drawn conditionally on their observed value for a sufficient statistic of the model. Although this idea is simple, even in Gaussian models conditioning on a sufficient statistic leads to a distribution supported on a set of zero Lebesgue measure, requiring techniques from topological measure theory to establish valid algorithms. We demonstrate how to do this for three models of interest, with simulations showing the new approach remains powerful under the weaker assumptions.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Dongming Huang"", ids = ""47817670""); list(name = ""Lucas Janson"", ids = ""2542753"")",,46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 7b767e7cb5b67589646f0c1162423ceeb2daa3a7; b89904af131755c692e4dd5044f3fb91b6b232f0; 512989c02ba7659f49cfeb858ca548a9d0e65db5; b3295bc1b2df23d0e01ab4c395a27a5a9a867625; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 0d85ad6cec690274cbdc8947ca19c8e26bba2a75; ebd3379c1f1b245b3f4b04a03881fbc2c4e504f8; 0dbaba394a79a48ee9a488648175e678fb3f9a70; 8383d71822437fe8cb39eadaddaff90430756e6a; 923fe895aa9a65ed9b9afeebe6c2c4935353ddcc; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; bff1a261c93b010c9f280646af16aebeccbb3df2; fe1b4f7d93ad2ee4bebe5802c9efa5e39c7aaf8f; 83d3f924375d9d80699fbd8e079e9b4ec0628ce3; cdbdefbe79f936d0fe16a4f3f109acd022a31316; 3ce4a6d66ec4eed360826e6d88d63a4fcd4e3a48; fe96483ba3f34ca4565e81a5cb130f66c02cf681; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; eddb3766525ad09e831933782f9d210e15449065; f9daa916bad47a617d292e721138b2d8770ecd30; 55a94221b0acb49f7cb2a2be1254cb4d836503c0; f65ac8f25fa8317ebf03ccfb0a700b547bf4e9e6; c6f27a11554d873060222aed9b2952a3be502db0; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728; a7350964a97b1132032414bb3e842392e819f999; 754ffb13958b8bf86d1acce5ca6e16c668deb519; c8cb93bdb01202ee3cc8322c1a03e2ba3978a74b,arXiv: Methodology,,
cd3a5d4ac0051fabd6fc1e7e80799fba20f43ca9,Genome comparison using Gene Ontology (GO) with statistical testing,"BackgroundAutomated comparison of complete sets of genes encoded in two genomes can provide insight on the genetic basis of differences in biological traits between species. Gene ontology (GO) is used as a common vocabulary to annotate genes for comparison. Current approaches calculate the fold of unweighted or weighted differences between two species at the high-level GO functional categories. However, to ensure the reliability of the differences detected, it is important to evaluate their statistical significance. It is also useful to search for differences at all levels of GO.ResultsWe propose a statistical approach to find reliable differences between the complete sets of genes encoded in two genomes at all levels of GO. The genes are first assigned GO terms from BLAST searches against genes with known GO assignments, and for each GO term the abundance of genes in the two genomes is compared using a chi-squared test followed by false discovery rate (FDR) correction. We applied this method to find statistically significant differences between two cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC7120. We then studied how the set of identified differences vary when different BLAST cutoffs are used. We also studied how the results vary when only subsets of the genes were used in the comparison of human vs. mouse and that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae vs. Schizosaccharomyces pombe.ConclusionThere is a surprising lack of statistical approaches for comparing complete genomes at all levels of GO. With the rapid increase of the number of sequenced genomes, we hope that the approach we proposed and tested can make valuable contribution to comparative genomics.",2006,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zhaotao Cai"", ids = ""2339517""); list(name = ""Xizeng Mao"", ids = ""8191287""); list(name = ""Songgang Li"", ids = ""1854171""); list(name = ""Liping Wei"", ids = ""35041316"")",6b18741fd5c6ab895acb11a559286c68b43eb9d4; da9db6d9a21a2560b38f651f8403923fabca243d; d69d0dc6401961e5adc1a6d9395f5405a3e3d6f4; 857093e9aee6f109e9b1d63dbd51b6fe1f69248a; 20e50283ec533173b20c83e08633136ba940b724; f9dad06b4a7d76f04cd52293b0b6573e665e1ff1; 03dcdc82702fb11dd659f52afbf77022a018a7ea; d8bb859f50b6122cd73a7028530f6b771c54d032; ca42d7dffd5861c919a2660b0146b5732df1b6de; 2130677306311f4dd2d412cac9baf9616fa40417; 10d4b58b7da6beb70b49e9008133b9a66701b1ac; 99a5d8b7bdd6d40c76d3e6b353aba5093061ac14; e195c2e3595bd5f4817a21ca96482b00b9206d90; c7055a70b4da9611d2240bc6bd1cebe09bc8886c; 6253ee903cf85cf5f14ce5104e15e8b39f0a0e9c; 32d1b6c546b730103552a1df3f19a95d970cbb54,3040ac52b3154de53a831715f2ce7f4e7d3d723b; 7a27877026d41260203e80cb2ba9a2389cc98bb0; 446d341779962dda0d0e7949fe761941f8d35db6; 45f4a4fa46b954425e09961d01ec70e4a21a54e8; c222da907b0f5ea928ccf9ecc06e65d0e6504cc7; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; 269a8428ea9d00a57792fe544ec2d784c476f3c0; 6dcfa4290906917ab0f69eddffce70eb089e8a29; 955fe5b0eb5e9fefab7bf21dede20e1285dca410; a6d19976df9bb8397df2c9b7a7c060ae1ac0d2c4; 49e84a0e09d9150372eeb2dea04066394465f8be; 0c1fb6916afccba7eaaff771b45debc2724a7ddd; 2acf78dd4106f9fe0a1d025cc757d2addf24fb9a; d5ed576effa823c176c54c935cdb97496095c32a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 476d151310f688d449a8886054dadffb6eafe3fa; 8f18cf7d9d04306da4b21e1a345839c80707c347; dacc0018d0a0c45d93599751e53c91f88fcd45b8; ffbb338ca39673852ef73e14a9f8512a3d18c4ac; 35df862dfc83007939b5e4a9e63474da84317776; 5425c068ebe0d3f2a071a189412e301dd7b6bcda; e553819d92685385a0cfcefd520e85e64e706423; 2b5f8ac201cde7aa2b12242b74d912379969f13d; c48c84af17753d0095d283240683c0b7297797b6; f49729428e59629338c829329ba639065aa6d7d9; 6e3782de55e7e7a914aa95e46d64ba65ede81a37; 444294f12f6b02a616958bac77902812f78c12cd; 1836aeaf61c6946d6d8c31d9309d043f17ca2b93; 10594c0682521eb5b08355dccabe7fb2de295b67; 3f747149a00d48e5552706f96a1353695358f287; 6e7da70eaca9b233112c4b6d204ee01aa37afe63; 2de816dcc310aeafb586cd775e063040d972621b; 55e9ab53e5f305d0dd3926edfc519e744a04aa61; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 4b3c2651ed1c0056789f363710ab1854fe544648; fac840799dcdfb267597a30d02d5877883a4d7d2; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 35356e08960766311e49de9e4fd298d538c3fbbe; a7532cd24cd03dd052f34ac755c6784c54a2c45c; 9ca7e7d67003931adb89799e5511628f93c68055; a7043b8f3f29051d320f68f00901093dcfd5d45a; 5476660d453dc0eb7132389babb673f2931bfe43; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 8db7cc0fe4f0ab782b8d2023a4e8e7816884b6f9; 07353b9f2db1a80b27847fc6ccd1e9ab85390104; 9c097333435b7552c86cdfa3e9c96f00d2955803; d363cfe06fb1428791f29c7825f9ea5e3956af92; f0e4c35e8650e48566cf5578b2ab0c715fce0577; a548ea66dd92c0b865118d33468fd4eed35e55b9; 733f53bc2b311e8c31792e14d1df01f213b25cf6; 21baf8233df5ac0f5881a4e6a03a7582ad0d0c78; 7e14067cd6893b2d5138cfdf7e50f6e820bd3f55; 6052a20665da1f23bf25bce2cbe8e41443a4fd24; 6ac0920e3ae7660307d1f2662a064756c96f2fd8; 3f17d6fd312ce63df4806e534efe1ae0dade34ae; 382ce79a21a3b9799e0acca92d9ade903b9542df,BMC Bioinformatics,7,374 - 374
0942e7c87919b27b8eecc1ca64c675c02e619b45,Prosit: proteome-wide prediction of peptide tandem mass spectra by deep learning,"In mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, the identification and quantification of peptides and proteins heavily rely on sequence database searching or spectral library matching. The lack of accurate predictive models for fragment ion intensities impairs the realization of the full potential of these approaches. Here, we extended the ProteomeTools synthetic peptide library to 550,000 tryptic peptides and 21â€‰million high-quality tandem mass spectra. We trained a deep neural network, termed Prosit, resulting in chromatographic retention time and fragment ion intensity predictions that exceed the quality of the experimental data. Integrating Prosit into database search pipelines led to more identifications at >10Ã— lower false discovery rates. We show the general applicability of Prosit by predicting spectra for proteases other than trypsin, generating spectral libraries for data-independent acquisition and improving the analysis of metaproteomes. Prosit is integrated into ProteomicsDB, allowing search result re-scoring and custom spectral library generation for any organism on the basis of peptide sequence alone.A deep learningâ€“based tool, Prosit, predicts high-quality peptide tandem mass spectra, improving peptide-identification performance compared with that of traditional proteomics analysis methods.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Siegfried Gessulat"", ids = ""8317307""); list(name = ""Tobias Schmidt"", ids = ""144406976""); list(name = ""Daniel Paul Zolg"", ids = ""8797960""); list(name = ""Patroklos Samaras"", ids = ""71439968""); list(name = ""Karsten Schnatbaum"", ids = ""8203620""); list(name = ""Johannes Zerweck"", ids = ""4150310""); list(name = ""Tobias Knaute"", ids = ""5994909""); list(name = ""Julia Rechenberger"", ids = ""66428768""); list(name = ""Bernard Delanghe"", ids = ""5067604""); list(name = ""Andreas Huhmer"", ids = ""145427350""); list(name = ""Ulf Reimer"", ids = ""34780680""); list(name = ""Hans-Christian Ehrlich"", ids = ""37516777""); list(name = ""Stephan Aiche"", ids = ""2681000""); list(name = ""Bernhard Kuster"", ids = ""144989238""); list(name = ""Mathias Wilhelm"", ids = ""144115574"")",8fe8c80f217be0843af6161b4f942d245f76ab67; 9e6d532e21998a169a88b4e013a839cd30894d42; 62d4e45072822d56321b7be8a3f2174773146ce7; 5f81ac165e69036195060dc704b124d101c6414e; d00463414f5a318725601c888f63f1c0e74aa461; 17c7ad1f42faec2a6cbe77fba56b86aaa7c2654d; 6726c162b4f4584114ad508ebfb14a3726ff2837; e3ed5e5273c4b42325dd9771f1b8d4f5da1b9d65; 3b3805b1010da4865817804d141daa5d670cabb4; 78c17bbf9327323a1429fed0d087e940cb019f54; 8894d431a768a35dc7ca4d762ebdba4f407b978c; dd3faf15ac66ffed8aae230989d7fe5a876ca970; 3f15c7d0ff668f43d515242f8cb191b1b6ce6998; 6edbd34c44c1dea07322843a4db6be23912666b2; d23f96a30defd2cccf1fe45ee6e932caa4ddfe16; 996e7e94d5f5a8e3be706f4beead88f45b1ea488; c60784c0ceb1e5444ae002738f32c225d28ddc19; 025ac496cb944689c2b4540f066ecc34dd56c9a1; a5cc34320095d2e28b0af1898840124d681efec5; 188cf21caaec19136265d51480dff8ec66378df2; 828b29df10de990cf54208ca6df5627db5793cf1; 49aee7c1269d612702a6125b6c1f9e8b4247b945; 48f99f52d2d7a09292c218e67aab9058a603e329,d54f04a0718543e141bd24b4e66d7214a576a592; 84042b9a7fd6b89d71e3f0897fa909af26473041; adfcf065e15fd3bc9badf6145034c84dfb08f204; 720b907057945b5792e9d1216b7d91a47807ff42,Nature Methods,16,509-518
89d8f76fc9b7753fedad555b6abc11c6321a2e03,In-depth characterization of the microRNA transcriptome in normal thyroid and papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"CONTEXT
A single microRNA gene may give rise to several mature products that differ in length, called isomiRs. IsomiRs are known to be tissue specific and functionally relevant. The microRNA sequence heterogeneity of the thyroid gland has yet to be determined.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to provide a comprehensive view of the microRNA transcriptome in normal thyroid and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).


DESIGN
We used next-generation deep sequencing to analyze microRNA length heterogeneity and expression profiles of PTC tumors (n = 14), unaffected tissue adjacent to tumors (n = 14), and control, noncancerous thyroid tissue (n = 14). The results were validated with a microarray on an additional set of 9 PTC tumor/normal tissue pairs.


RESULTS
Eighty-nine microRNAs were significantly deregulated in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissue (false discovery rate < 0.05, fold change 0.13-20.7). Top deregulated miRNAs included miR-146b-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-7-3p, miR-551b-3p, miR-486-3p, and miR-144-3p, confirming previous microarray profiling. The expression of miRNAs did not depend on the BRAF mutation status. Interestingly, 85% of the most abundant microRNAs consisted of isoforms that differed from the standard reference sequence deposited in miRBase. Moreover, the reference microRNAs were completely absent in 42.4% and 35.9% of the microRNAs expressed in normal thyroid and PTC tumors, respectively. Numerous isomiRs had altered seed sequences, which led to a different set of target genes. For highly deregulated miR-146b-5p, we detected 6 isoforms (tumor/normal fold change 14.4-28.7, false discovery rate < 0.002) that varied at their 5' ends with a 1-nt difference that created 2 alternative seeds.

Results from a cohort study.,"4506 Background: Gene polymorphisms in critical signaling pathways may impact recurrence in patients with localized renal cell cancer (RCC) Methods: Germline DNA was extracted from 425 patients of European-American ancestry that were enrolled in a prospective protocol with full baseline and follow up clinical data. Using the Sequenom iPLEX Gold platform, genotyping was performed for select genes involved in RCC pathogenesis, angiogenesis, metabolism, and immune regulation, including VHL, HIF-1, HIF-2, VEGF, VEGFR-2, CAIX, mTOR, PI3K, CTLA4, PD1, and B7H1. The primary endpoint was recurrence free interval (RFI), defined as time from surgery to recurrence or last follow-up. Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to evaluate and identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RFI. A multivariate model adjusted for clinical factors which predict recurrence. The false discovery rate (pFDR) was used to control for the number of tests performed. With 45% RFI events, and 10% variant prevalence, there was 86% power to detect HR=2.0 (two sided alpha=0.05) Results: The median follow-up time was 49.1 months. Clinical factors associated with RFI included age at diagnosis (log-rank p=0.02), clinical stage (p<0.001), Fuhrman nuclear grade (p<0.001), performance status (p<0.001), and tumor size (p<0.001). Three SNPs in 2 genes were found to be highly predictive of RFI in univariate analysis; HIF2A (2 SNPs with p=6.00 E-4 for each) and ABCB1 (1 SNP with p=3.00 E-4). The prognostic features of these SNPs remain significant after adjusting for clinical factors (p=0.004 for the SNP in the ABCB1 gene and p=0.009 for the SNPs in the HIF-2 gene). The SNP associated with the highest recurrence risk resides in the ABCB1 gene, which codes for the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein. Homozygotes for the risk haplotype have an adjusted HR of 2.88 (95% CI, 1.4-5.9; p=.004) for shorter RFI, compared to patients with other haplotypes Conclusions: This is the first study to implicate germline variations in critical signaling pathways with cancer recurrence in patients with localized RCC.

aaff13fabd3866311343cf9a2a2dc6fcef3bb85f,Subcortical brain volume differences in participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adults: a cross-sectional mega-analysis.,"BACKGROUND
Neuroimaging studies have shown structural alterations in several brain regions in children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Through the formation of the international ENIGMA ADHD Working Group, we aimed to address weaknesses of previous imaging studies and meta-analyses, namely inadequate sample size and methodological heterogeneity. We aimed to investigate whether there are structural differences in children and adults with ADHD compared with those without this diagnosis.


METHODS
In this cross-sectional mega-analysis, we used the data from the international ENIGMA Working Group collaboration, which in the present analysis was frozen at Feb 8, 2015. Individual sites analysed structural T1-weighted MRI brain scans with harmonised protocols of individuals with ADHD compared with those who do not have this diagnosis. Our primary outcome was to assess case-control differences in subcortical structures and intracranial volume through pooling of all individual data from all cohorts in this collaboration. For this analysis, p values were significant at the false discovery rate corrected threshold of p=0Â·0156.


FINDINGS
Our sample comprised 1713 participants with ADHD and 1529 controls from 23 sites with a median age of 14 years (range 4-63 years). The volumes of the accumbens (Cohen's d=-0Â·15), amygdala (d=-0Â·19), caudate (d=-0Â·11), hippocampus (d=-0Â·11), putamen (d=-0Â·14), and intracranial volume (d=-0Â·10) were smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls in the mega-analysis. There was no difference in volume size in the pallidum (p=0Â·95) and thalamus (p=0Â·39) between people with ADHD and controls. Exploratory lifespan modelling suggested a delay of maturation and a delay of degeneration, as effect sizes were highest in most subgroups of children (<15 years) versus adults (>21 years): in the accumbens (Cohen's d=-0Â·19 vs -0Â·10), amygdala (d=-0Â·18 vs -0Â·14), caudate (d=-0Â·13 vs -0Â·07), hippocampus (d=-0Â·12 vs -0Â·06), putamen (d=-0Â·18 vs -0Â·08), and intracranial volume (d=-0Â·14 vs 0Â·01). There was no difference between children and adults for the pallidum (p=0Â·79) or thalamus (p=0Â·89). Case-control differences in adults were non-significant (all p>0Â·03). Psychostimulant medication use (all p>0Â·15) or symptom scores (all p>0Â·02) did not influence results, nor did the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders (all p>0Â·5).


INTERPRETATION
With the largest dataset to date, we add new knowledge about bilateral amygdala, accumbens, and hippocampus reductions in ADHD. We extend the brain maturation delay theory for ADHD to include subcortical structures and refute medication effects on brain volume suggested by earlier meta-analyses. Lifespan analyses suggest that, in the absence of well powered longitudinal studies, the ENIGMA cross-sectional sample across six decades of ages provides a means to generate hypotheses about lifespan trajectories in brain phenotypes.

Efforts to exploit peptide RT for peptide identification can be frustrated by its variability across liquid chromatography analyses. We show that peptide RT can be reliably predicted by training a support vector regressor on a single chromatography run. This dynamically trained model outperforms a published statically trained model of peptide RT across diverse chromatography conditions. In addition, the model can be used to filter peptide identifications that produce large discrepancies between observed and predicted RT. After filtering, estimated true positive peptide identifications increase by as much as 50% at a false discovery rate of 3%, with the largest increase for non-specific cleavage with elastase.",2007,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Aaron A.

We first analyzed fMRI images obtained from a single subject during a noun-verb matching task. Data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) using two different voxel sizes, and results were displayed at three different levels of statistical significance. At each statistical threshold, results were first uncorrected for multiple comparisons and spatial extent and then presented using a spatial extent cluster of 20 voxels. We then statistically controlled the Type I error rate associated with multiple comparisons by using the false discovery rate and by the random field adjustment for false-positive rate used by SPM. We also examined group results from language and graphesthesia paradigms at three levels of statistical significance. In all circumstances, apparent random activations decreased as more conservative statistical approaches were employed, but activation in areas considered to be functionally significant was also reduced.

35a28bb331fcd2cda4f401b3a2ee22eff3cbf148,A comparison of random-field-theory and false-discovery-rate inference results in the analysis of registered one-dimensional biomechanical datasets,"Background
The inflation of falsely rejected hypotheses associated with multiple hypothesis testing is seen as a threat to the knowledge base in the scientific literature. One of the most recently developed statistical constructs to deal with this problem is the false discovery rate (FDR), which aims to control the proportion of the falsely rejected null hypotheses among those that are rejected. FDR has been applied to a variety of problems, especially for the analysis of 3-D brain images in the field of Neuroimaging, where the predominant form of statistical inference involves the more conventional control of false positives, through Gaussian random field theory (RFT). In this study we considered FDR and RFT as alternative methods for handling multiple testing in the analysis of 1-D continuum data. The field of biomechanics has recently adopted RFT, but to our knowledge FDR has not previously been used to analyze 1-D biomechanical data, nor has there been a consideration of how FDR vs. RFT can affect biomechanical interpretations.


Methods
We reanalyzed a variety of publicly available experimental datasets to understand the characteristics which contribute to the convergence and divergence of RFT and FDR results. We also ran a variety of numerical simulations involving smooth, random Gaussian 1-D data, with and without true signal, to provide complementary explanations for the experimental results.


Results
Our results suggest that RFT and FDR thresholds (the critical test statistic value used to judge statistical significance) were qualitatively identical for many experimental datasets, but were highly dissimilar for others, involving non-trivial changes in data interpretation. Simulation results clarified that RFT and FDR thresholds converge as the true signal weakens and diverge when the signal is broad in terms of the proportion of the continuum size it occupies. Results also showed that, while sample size affected the relation between RFT and FDR results for small sample sizes (<15), this relation was stable for larger sample sizes, wherein only the nature of the true signal was important.


Discussion
RFT and FDR thresholds are both computationally efficient because both are parametric, but only FDR has the ability to adapt to the signal features of particular datasets, wherein the threshold lowers with signal strength for a gain in sensitivity.

f31196124a9485030ced67a2ea768126e39406db,HT-eQTL: integrative expression quantitative trait loci analysis in a large number of human tissues,"BackgroundExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis identifies genetic markers associated with the expression of a gene. Most existing eQTL analyses and methods investigate association in a single, readily available tissue, such as blood. Joint analysis of eQTL in multiple tissues has the potential to improve, and expand the scope of, single-tissue analyses. Large-scale collaborative efforts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program are currently generating high quality data in a large number of tissues. However, computational constraints limit genome-wide multi-tissue eQTL analysis.ResultsWe develop an integrative method under a hierarchical Bayesian framework for eQTL analysis in a large number of tissues. The model fitting procedure is highly scalable, and the computing time is a polynomial function of the number of tissues. Multi-tissue eQTLs are identified through a local false discovery rate approach, which rigorously controls the false discovery rate. Using simulation and GTEx real data studies, we show that the proposed method has superior performance to existing methods in terms of computing time and the power of eQTL discovery.ConclusionsWe provide a scalable method for eQTL analysis in a large number of tissues. The method enables the identification of eQTL with different configurations and facilitates the characterization of tissue specificity.",2018,Mathematics; Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gen Li"", ids = ""145251464""); list(name = ""Dereje Jima"", ids = ""48960692""); list(name = ""Fred A.

bc12edf4485722a68f48913b239cdeb21ce52bca,Power and sample size estimation in high dimensional biology,"Genomic scientists often test thousands of hypotheses in a single experiment. One example is a microarray experiment that seeks to determine differential gene expression among experimental groups. Planning such experiments involves a determination of sample size that will allow meaningful interpretations. Traditional power analysis methods may not be well suited to this task when thousands of hypotheses are tested in a discovery oriented basic research. We introduce the concept of expected discovery rate (EDR) and an approach that combines parametric mixture modelling with parametric bootstrapping to estimate the sample size needed for a desired accuracy of results. While the examples included are derived from microarray studies, the methods, herein, are â€˜extraparadigmaticâ€™ in the approach to study design and are applicable to most high dimensional biological situations. Pilot data from three different microarray experiments are used to extrapolate EDR as well as the related false discovery rate at different sample sizes and thresholds.",2004,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Gary L.

efd61e2ae0c79eb21cf44d2b9c6b460604c51f83,Two-Step Mixed Model Approach to Analyzing Differential Alternative RNA Splicing,"Changes in gene expression can correlate with poor disease outcomes in two ways: through changes in relative transcript levels or through alternative RNA splicing leading to changes in relative abundance of individual transcript isoforms. The objective of this research is to develop new statistical methods in detecting and analyzing both differentially expressed and spliced isoforms, which appropriately account for the dependence between isoforms and multiple testing corrections for the multi-dimensional structure of at both the gene- and isoform-level. We developed a linear mixed effects model-based approach for analyzing the complex alternative RNA splicing regulation patterns detected by whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing technologies. This approach thoroughly characterizes and differentiates three types of genes related to alternative RNA splicing events with distinct differential expression/splicing patterns. We applied the concept of appropriately controlling for the gene-level overall false discovery rate (OFDR) in this multi-dimensional alternative RNA splicing analysis utilizing a two-step hierarchical hypothesis testing framework. In the initial screening test we identify genes that have differentially expressed or spliced isoforms; in the subsequent confirmatory testing stage we examine only the isoforms for genes that have passed the screening tests.

a4d0307da529a2d9000569da63dd6068aa5a6fdd,Hypothalamic gene expression profile indicates a reduction in G protein signaling in the Wfs1 mutant mice.,"The Wfs1 gene codes for a protein with unknown function, but deficiency in this protein results in a range of neuropsychiatric and neuroendocrine syndromes. In the present study we aimed to find the functional networks influenced by Wfs1 in the hypothalamus. We performed gene expression profiling (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Arrays) in Wfs1-deficient mice; 305 genes were differentially expressed with nominal P value<0.01. FDR (false discovery rate)-adjusted P values were significant (0.007) only for two genes: C4b (t=9.66) and Wfs1 (t=-9.03). However, several genes related to G protein signaling were very close to the FDR-adjusted significance level, such as Rgs4 (regulator of G protein signaling 4) that was downregulated (-0.34, t=-5.4) in Wfs1-deficient mice. Changes in Rgs4 and C4b expression were confirmed by QRT-PCR. In humans, Rgs4 is in the locus for bipolar disease (BPD), and its expression is downregulated in BPD. C4b is a gene related to the neurodegenerative diseases. Functional analysis including the entire data set revealed significant alterations in the canonical pathway ""G protein-coupled receptor signaling."" The gene expression profile in the hypothalami of the Wfs1 mutant mice was significantly similar to the profiles of following biological functions: psychological disorders, bipolar disorder, mood disorder. In conclusion, hypothalamic gene expression profile resembles with some molecular pathways functionally related to the clinical syndromes in the Wolfram syndrome patients.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sulev KÃµks"", ids = ""4095225""); list(name = ""Ursel Soomets"", ids = ""6788898""); list(name = ""Mario Plaas"", ids = ""3582449""); list(name = ""Anton Terasmaa"", ids = ""6797311""); list(name = ""Klari Noormets"", ids = ""4780103""); list(name = ""Vallo Tillmann"", ids = ""4777859""); list(name = ""Eero Vasar"", ids = ""74764200""); list(name = ""Cathy Fernandes"", ids = ""46589411""); list(name = ""Leonard C.

e8fa4e6361ee41186e8b136bff09c8c44bbdafd8,PO-387 Differential gene methylation in triple negative breast cancer and non-tumoral mammary tissue,"Introduction Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent neoplasia among women and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. It is a clinically heterogeneous disease, with the triple negative (TN) as the most aggressive subtype. Epigenetic alterations are common molecular abnormalities in cancer, including changes in DNA methylation, microRNA profiling and post-translational modifications of histones. Aberrant DNA methylation has been recognised as one of the most common epigenetic modifications in BC. Methylation of certain genes is associated with pathological features, differential response to therapy or metastases during follow-up, being also a predictor of survival in BC; but little is known about its involvement in TN BC. Our objective was to identify the methylome of TN BC compared to that of non-neoplastic mammary tissue. Material and methods A 450k-methylation array was performed to identify differentially methylated genes in 8 TN BC samples (T) and 5 non-neoplastic (N) tissues from reduction mammoplasties. For that, DNA was extracted, bisulphite-converted, whole-genome amplified and hybridised to Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. The level of DNA methylation at each CpG locus (Î²-value) was calculated as M/(M+U), ranging from 0 (100% unmethylated, U) to 1 (100% methylated, M). Differentially expressed probes were obtained by limma t-test (False Discovery Rate 0.2 and located in CpG islands in the 5Â´UTR, 1500â€“200â€‰bp upstream the transcription start site or in the first exon, were considered. ADAM12, VWCE and TSPAN9 genes were selected for further validation by pyrosequencing in a series of 30 T and 20â€‰n, using a PyroMark Q24 after PCR amplification. Protein expression was explored by immunohistochemistry. Results and discussions A total of 700 hypermethylated and 349 hypomethylated probes in T compared to N, corresponding to 15 and 7 hyper- and hypomethylated genes, respectively, were found to fulfil our criteria. ADAM12, VWCE and TSPAN9 genes showed lower methylation levels in T than in N (p Conclusion This is the first description of ADAM12, VWCE and TSPAN9 hypomethylation and overexpression in TN BC compared to non-neoplastic mammary tissues.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Antonio Garmendia"", ids = ""46397832""); list(name = ""Esperanza MartÃ­n-SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""1401298891""); list(name = ""Saioa Mendaza"", ids = ""8796653""); list(name = ""IÃ±aki Monreal-Santesteban"", ids = ""1413009938""); list(name = ""Alicia CÃ³rdoba"", ids = ""153022948""); list(name = ""Yerani Ruiz de AzÃºa"", ids = ""90760428""); list(name = ""Valle Coca"", ids = ""6769333""); list(name = ""David Guerrero-Setas"", ids = ""1399923492"")",,,,3,
7452edbab323923d41c7f02711c51c5e5fb0ca20,The PHF21B gene is associated with major depression and modulates the stress response,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects around 350 million people worldwide; however, the underlying genetic basis remains largely unknown. In this study, we took into account that MDD is a gene-environment disorder, in which stress is a critical component, and used whole-genome screening of functional variants to investigate the â€˜missing heritabilityâ€™ in MDD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effect models were performed in a Los Angeles Mexican-American cohort (196 controls, 203 MDD) and in a replication European-ancestry cohort (499 controls, 473 MDD). Our analyses took into consideration the stress levels in the control populations. The Mexican-American controls, comprised primarily of recent immigrants, had high levels of stress due to acculturation issues and the European-ancestry controls with high stress levels were given higher weights in our analysis. We identified 44 common and rare functional variants associated with mild to moderate MDD in the Mexican-American cohort (genome-wide false discovery rate, FDR, <0.05), and their pathway analysis revealed that the three top overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) processes were innate immune response, glutamate receptor signaling and detection of chemical stimulus in smell sensory perception. Rare variant analysis replicated the association of the PHF21B gene in the ethnically unrelated European-ancestry cohort. The TRPM2 gene, previously implicated in mood disorders, may also be considered replicated by our analyses. Whole-genome sequencing analyses of a subset of the cohorts revealed that European-ancestry individuals have a significantly reduced (50%) number of single nucleotide variants compared with Mexican-American individuals, and for this reason the role of rare variants may vary across populations. PHF21b variants contribute significantly to differences in the levels of expression of this gene in several brain areas, including the hippocampus. Furthermore, using an animal model of stress, we found that Phf21b hippocampal gene expression is significantly decreased in animals resilient to chronic restraint stress when compared with non-chronically stressed animals. Together, our results reveal that including stress level data enables the identification of novel rare functional variants associated with MDD.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ma-Li Wong"", ids = ""144096988""); list(name = ""Mauricio Arcos-Burgos"", ids = ""1397802503""); list(name = ""Sha Liu"", ids = ""1777681""); list(name = ""Jorge IvÃ¡n VÃ©lez"", ids = ""118492733""); list(name = ""Chenglong Yu"", ids = ""46756127""); list(name = ""Bernhard T.

5e9e36b50aba44a58cfc084ca2f43aa13da778c8,Cytokine production by activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells and natural killer cells is suppressed by an IRAK4 inhibitor,"BackgroundIn systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), immune complexes (ICs) containing self-derived nucleic acids trigger the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells. We asked how an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 small molecule inhibitor (IRAK4i) affects RNA-IC-induced cytokine production compared with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).MethodsPlasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and natural killer (NK) cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals. PBMCs from SLE patients and healthy individuals were depleted of monocytes. Cells were stimulated with RNA-containing IC (RNA-IC) in the presence or absence of IRAK4i I92 or HCQ, and cytokines were measured by immunoassay or flow cytometry. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on RNA-IC-stimulated pDCs from healthy individuals to assess the effect of IRAK4i and HCQ.ResultsIn healthy individuals, RNA-IC induced interferon (IFN)-Î±, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-Î³, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1-Î±, and MIP1-Î² production in pDC and NK cell cocultures. IFN-Î± production was selective for pDCs, whereas both pDCs and NK cells produced TNF-Î±. IRAK4i reduced the pDC and NK cell-derived cytokine production by 74â€“95%. HCQ interfered with cytokine production in pDCs but not in NK cells. In monocyte-depleted PBMCs, IRAK4i blocked cytokine production more efficiently than HCQ. Following RNA-IC activation of pDCs, 975 differentially expressed genes were observed (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05), with many connected to cytokine pathways, cell regulation, and apoptosis. IRAK4i altered the expression of a larger number of RNA-IC-induced genes than did HCQ (492 versus 65 genes).ConclusionsThe IRAK4i I92 exhibits a broader inhibitory effect than HCQ on proinflammatory pathways triggered by RNA-IC, suggesting IRAK4 inhibition as a therapeutic option in SLE.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Karin Hjorton"", ids = ""15487406""); list(name = ""Niklas Hagberg"", ids = ""10101094""); list(name = ""Elisabeth Israelsson"", ids = ""50823200""); list(name = ""Lisa Jinton"", ids = ""5525180""); list(name = ""Olof Berggren"", ids = ""144273528""); list(name = ""Johanna K.

No similar relationship was found so far in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). We hypothesized that drug sensitivity profile combined with gene expression profile can provide a new insight into selection of drugs used in high-dose therapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and determine the role of specific drugs. Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze the gene expression profile in correlation to the ex vivo obtained chemosensitivity profile of drugs used in high-dose therapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with ALL and AML. Methods: We tested leukemic cells from 56 children (43 ALL de novo , 8 relapsed ALL, 5 AML de novo ) for ex vivo sensitivity to etoposide, fludarabine, 4-HOO-cyclophosphamide, busulfan, treosulfan and melphalan. The cells were then subjected to an assessment of global profile of gene expression to identify differentially expressed genes in drug-sensitive and drug-resistant ALL. Cells were isolated from bone marrow at the initial diagnosis of leukemia or its relapse. In vitro cytotoxicity was analyzed by means of the MTT assay. The drug resistance was expressed as the IC50, the inhibitory concentration to 50% of the cells. RNA was extracted with the use of Trizol, purified and assessed for integrity. Samples were hybridized to the Human Genome U133A Chip oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix) according to manufacturer9s protocol. Dataset was pre-processed by RMA method and small variability genes were filtered out. The final analysis was carried out in 13 835 probe sets. Non-parametric Spearman9s correlations of IC50 and gene expression values were analyzed. Results: From all analyzed drugs, the largest number of genes significantly associated with the chemosensitivity profile across samples was observed for etoposide. We found 386 probests significantly correlated with the IC50 values (Spearman9s correlation coefficient ranging from R==0.7 to R=0.61, p NUDT21 gene (Nudix, nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type, motif 21) was found to be highly significantly (False Discovery Rate, FDR FRY gene (Drosophila Furry homolog), Spearman9s correlation coefficient R=0.61 (FDR=0.27%). Melphalan sensitivity was associated with biologically interesting differences in gene expression of PIP4K2A (Phosphatidyloinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase, type II, alpha; over-expressed in patients with high IC50 for this drug) and POLR2C (RNA Polymerase II, DNA directed, polypeptide C, 33 kDa; down-regulated in this subset of cases). Conclusions: Expression of a single genes is strongly associated with drug resistance in childhood acute leukemia, and it may aid to determine drug sensitivity to high-dose chemotherapy. Etoposide and fludarabine sensitivity seem to be related to the significant number of biologically important genes.

dd27aa44057c1c8eefbd1eb4fd2e2c1ad3184356,Association between polymorphisms in cancer-related genes and early onset of esophageal adenocarcinoma.,"There is an increasing incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) among younger people in the western populations. However, the association between genetic polymorphisms and the age of EA onset is unclear. In this study, 1330 functional/tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 354 cancer-related genes were genotyped in 335 white EA patients. Twenty important SNPs that have the highest importance scores and lowest classification error rate were identified by the random forest algorithm to be associated with early onset of EA (age â‰¤ 55 years). Subsequent logistic regression analysis indicated that 10 SNPs (rs2070744 of NOS3, rs720321 of BCL2, rs17757541 of BCL2, rs11775256 of TNFRSF10A, rs1035142 of CASP8, rs2236302 of MMP14, rs4740363 of ABL1, rs696217 of GHRL, rs2445762 of CYP19A1, and rs11941492 of VEGFR2/KDR) were significantly associated with early onset of EA (â‰¤55 vs >55 years, all P < .05 after adjusting for co-variates and false discovery rate). Among them, five SNPs in the NOS3, BCL2, TNFRSF10A, and CASP8 genes were known to be involved in apoptosis processes. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, rs2070744 of NOS3, rs720321 of BCL2, and rs1035142 of CASP8 were also significantly associated with early onset of EA. Moreover, there was a higher risk of developing EA at a younger age when one had more risk genotypes. In conclusion, polymorphisms in cancer-related genes, especially those in the apoptotic pathway, play an important role in the development of younger-aged EA in a dose-response manner.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""I-Chen Wu"", ids = ""40127331""); list(name = ""Yang Zhao"", ids = ""46317054""); list(name = ""Rihong Zhai"", ids = ""144991251""); list(name = ""Geoffrey Liu"", ids = ""48573578""); list(name = ""Monica Ter-Minassian"", ids = ""1397907643""); list(name = ""Kofi Asomaning"", ids = ""5954127""); list(name = ""Li Su"", ids = ""145235478""); list(name = ""Chen-Yu Liu"", ids = ""39664967""); list(name = ""Feng Chen"", ids = ""145123438""); list(name = ""Matthew H.

3983869a45db575737795449d07ebdcedcd419a7,Optimal alpha reduces error rates in gene expression studies: a meta-analysis approach,"BackgroundTranscriptomic approaches (microarray and RNA-seq) have been a tremendous advance for molecular science in all disciplines, but they have made interpretation of hypothesis testing more difficult because of the large number of comparisons that are done within an experiment. The result has been a proliferation of techniques aimed at solving the multiple comparisons problem, techniques that have focused primarily on minimizing Type I error with little or no concern about concomitant increases in Type II errors. We have previously proposed a novel approach for setting statistical thresholds with applications for high throughput omics-data, optimal Î±, which minimizes the probability of making either error (i.e. Type I or II) and eliminates the need for post-hoc adjustments.ResultsA meta-analysis of 242 microarray studies extracted from the peer-reviewed literature found that current practices for setting statistical thresholds led to very high Type II error rates. Further, we demonstrate that applying the optimal Î± approach results in error rates as low or lower than error rates obtained when using (i) no post-hoc adjustment, (ii) a Bonferroni adjustment and (iii) a false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment which is widely used in transcriptome studies.ConclusionsWe conclude that optimal Î± can reduce error rates associated with transcripts in both microarray and RNA-seq experiments, but point out that improved statistical techniques alone cannot solve the problems associated with high throughput datasets â€“ these approaches need to be coupled with improved experimental design that considers larger sample sizes and/or greater study replication.",2017,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""J.

036e7342acc5382a3f523c2a2f1b22cac411e62e,Abstract B042: Broad analysis and more accurate predictions of HLA class I epitope binding in 92 common HLA alleles profiled by mono-allelic mass spectrometry,"Introduction: Cancer vaccine therapies rely on accurate personalized selection of immunizing peptides in order to potentiate tumor-specific immune responses against neoepitopes derived from somatic mutations. Given the unique accumulation of mutations in each tumor as well as the patientâ€™s particular complement of HLA class I alleles, the ability to accurately predict which epitopes will be presented by tumor cells is a fundamental prerequisite for successful vaccine design. By utilizing a mono-allelic mass spectrometry (MS) strategy for profiling the endogenous HLA class I peptidome, we recently showed that prediction of endogenous presentation can be drastically improved when model training integrates peptide sequence along with intracellular signals such as likelihood of proteasomal processing and peptide abundance. Yet the limited set of mono-allelic data did not allow for deep comparative analysis across HLA- A, B, and C alleles, which can better inform pan-allele predictor design. Moreover, the significant variability in per-allele model performance remains unexplained. Methods: We recently developed a scalable mono-allelic MS technique to profile naturally presented peptides on HLA molecules, whereby the HLA class I deficient B721.221 cell line is transfected with HLA expression vectors coding for a single allele of interest and eluted HLA peptides are analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In addition, endogenously presented antigens on primary tumor-derived cell lines from 4 melanoma patients were also identified via MS. To extract knowledge from this unique dataset, we implemented computational tools to summarize, visualize, and compare the characteristics of HLA- A, B, C, and G alleles and developed a novel approach to define allele similarity that takes into account the collection of sub-motifs per allele. We trained neural network prediction models, validated their performance on internal and external datasets, and analyzed the variability in performance across alleles. Results: To date, we have generated binding data for 92 HLA- A, B, C and G alleles, identifying more than 190,000 peptides and covering the most frequent alleles in the population. Extensive mono-allelic profiling revealed that some alleles present non-9-mer peptides with high frequency. The availability of large number of non-9-mer peptides allowed us to build length-specific models that often performed better than the corresponding non-length-specific models currently used. We observe that HLA- A and B alleles present more peptides of length 10 and 11 than C alleles, while C alleles have a higher propensity for 8-mers. Correlation-based analysis of binding motifs revealed that HLA-A and B motifs are more specific whereas C motifs are less stringent and thus share more overlapping binders. Since binding data are available only for a fraction of all known alleles, pan-allele models implicitly embed allele similarity to predict for uncharacterized alleles based on the sequence of the binding pocket. By clustering allele-specific peptides into sub-motifs, we propose a novel explicit approach to delineate allele similarity at finer granularity that can improve pan-allele model design. We show that our allele-specific models are better at discriminating tumor-presented epitopes than state of the art predictors and investigate the relationship between false discovery rate and natural abundance of anchor residues to better understand differences in model accuracy amongst alleles. Finally, deconvolution of tumor-presented peptides demonstrated that ~10% of peptides are presented on HLA-C, which has been historically understudied. Conclusions: We have vastly expanded the collection of endogenous HLA-specific peptides deriving biologic insights into the principles of epitope presentations and valuable considerations for prediction model design and epitope selection for tumor vaccines.

bc3bfccb15e03561ff48454d49079b77b3681348,Detection of non-structural outliers for microarray experiments,"Outliers are unavoidable in many experiments due to various complex reasons ranging from equipment resolution to data contamination. The presence of outliers in microarray gene expression data can affect the quality of gene selection and ranking. This effect is severe when a microarray gene expression data is composed of too few samples. We classify outliers occurred in microarray gene expression data as structural and non-structural outliers. Structural outliers are gene dependent or sample dependent (or both) whereas non-structural outliers are gene and sample-independent. They are uninformative to gene expression differentiation but can cause misclassification of a differentially expressed gene as a non-differentially expressed one. While there are algorithms for detecting structural outliers, a different strategy is required for detecting non-structural outliers. We show the impact of non-structural outliers on gene selection/ranking and false discovery rate control. We also show the unsuitableness of existing outlier detection algorithms for detecting non-structural outliers. We propose a new algorithm for detecting non-structural outliers. It models the consecutive differences of ordered gene expressions as exponentially distributed. We use simulated and real data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in correcting for non-structural outliers and improving gene selection/ranking and false discovery rate control.",2014,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zihua Yang"", ids = ""2732722""); list(name = ""Zhengrong Yang"", ids = ""2049686"")",,80f61ca18b414417cb4455d8bd78df3416dbea93; 9b1104b2ccb8953078977efc8f2f79479c6f5801; c02a44a690dd0fdbc5e1b242cc31deb723418fa1; 9441537f6bf06f3e25b27a0aaea23e1b2dfd4eff; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; de64b4f8bffe8cc846b60b00c13acca17631cb45; 5401899ccf02357afcc50950ab72cdc5e8155f03; 047f43f3807f909d5788c7e33aefa732e0fffa7d; 59f769a1deea3bd8121dbd23e0f16d3ec56b945f; e010584f68816b306fa038ca812d0c8b4ba011a9; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; 4ecf5dcb1d5d10d820f46a59ef5d0f7ccc52c3e7; 988de145cc4908064ad1f358136150289a5d3a55; 82f69ec1ee923465a74cdf372fadc5946dde461b; d5064e13b8b7b961b00dc6c4edc4a4c46e7b0499; b9f2a4e71011e2c56e989ae158ee0e38071ce805; f33a2d441cc21ac1cbbc45d98bfd69ead453c270; 09afbb1e919fdd74310e5f50a98fcd3048cbcb6f; aa21536103308d8c46c4ab67473f2448bc8bd1f6; 5033fa9b716c8935a919c60213db6de1a1ab1c2f; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; c4e70e806963baba7165255344531fef0b4f2f09; e2c20bfbff9f1a3afecf08986c4c0b33af2d5d00; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; db368e3fdb6bc67405ecb62e4c40cfac85be29f7; 5c2f4494f7ff8b93433f3432a4ce271586f6d56f; e76f9b50325d44b06e2b90ac65996afd5a06b4d8; cbba3d57380d329675f48c06fe4947f794e14103,2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),,1600-1605

The aim of this study was to determine whether the association is modified by genetic variation in immune genes. A population-based case-control study involving 601 incident cases of NHL and 717 controls was carried out in 1996-2000 among women from Connecticut. Thirty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 17 immune genes were examined in relation to the associations between exposure to various solvents and the risk for NHL. The study found that polymorphism in interleukin 10 (IL10; rs1800890) modified the association between occupational exposure to organic solvents and the risk for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (P(for interaction)=0.0058). The results remained statistically significant after adjustment for false discovery rate. Compared with women who were never occupationally exposed to any organic solvents, women who were exposed to organic solvents at least once had a significantly increased risk for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma if they carried the IL10 (rs1800890) TT genotype (odds ratio=3.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.80-6.08), but not if they carried the AT/AA genotype (odds ratio=1.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-1.79). No significant interactions were observed for other immune gene single nucleotide polymorphisms and various solvents in relation to NHL overall and its major subtypes. The study provided preliminary evidence supporting a role of immune gene variations in modifying the association between occupational solvent exposure and the risk for NHL.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Qian Fei Deng"", ids = ""46551960""); list(name = ""Tongzhang Zheng"", ids = ""145927602""); list(name = ""Qing Lan"", ids = ""2359692""); list(name = ""Yajia Lan"", ids = ""21589960""); list(name = ""Theodore Holford"", ids = ""3226774""); list(name = ""Yingtai Chen"", ids = ""51029152""); list(name = ""Min Dai"", ids = ""47353573""); list(name = ""Brian P.

Objective: We sought to identify earlyâ€life environmental risk factors for childhood asthma in a birth cohort of highâ€risk innerâ€city children. Methods: We examined the relationship of prenatal and earlyâ€life environmental factors to the occurrence of asthma at 7 years of age among 442 children. Results: Higher house dust concentrations of cockroach, mouse, and cat allergens in the first 3 years of life were associated with lower risk of asthma (for cockroach allergen: odds ratio per interquartile range increase in concentration, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36â€0.86; P < .01). House dust microbiome analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing identified 202 and 171 bacterial taxa that were significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) more or less abundant, respectively, in the homes of children with asthma. A majority of these bacteria were significantly correlated with 1 of more allergen concentrations. Other factors associated significantly positively with asthma included umbilical cord plasma cotinine concentration (odds ratio per geometric SD increase in concentration, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.00â€3.09; P = .048) and maternal stress and depression scores. Conclusion: Among highâ€risk innerâ€city children, higher indoor levels of pet or pest allergens in infancy were associated with lower risk of asthma.

Protozoa have been implicated in harboring pathogenic bacteria and enhancing virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. To better understand this relationship with Escherichia coli O157:H7, we characterized its transcriptome within A. castellanii compared with broth-grown organisms using two-color microarrays. Statistical analysis indicated that 969 genes were differentially expressed at P<0.018, with a false discovery rate of 1.9% and a fold change cutoff of 1.3 or greater. There were 655 upregulated transcripts that include 40 genes associated with virulence, of which 32 are encoded on O-islands, and include shiga toxin genes (stx1A, stx1B stx2A) and 14 genes involved in Type III secretion system components. Also included are SOS response genes such as lexA and recA, genes involved in or predicted to be involved in antibiotic resistance (rarD, macAB, marABR, mdtK, yojI, yhgN), the quorum-sensing operon lsrACDB, and the efe and feo iron-acquisition systems. There were 314 downregulated transcripts that included 19 transcripts associated with virulence, seven of which are encoded on O-islands. Our results demonstrate that a significant portion of the E. coli O157:H7 genome was differentially expressed as a result of the protozoan intracellular environment.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael D.

b922ef1374e8f7345e2aea3b9ad6dc2bf9a723c5,Fresh Frozen Plasma Modulates Brain Gene Expression in a Swine Model of Traumatic Brain Injury and Shock: A Network Analysis.,"BACKGROUND
Resuscitation with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) decreases brain lesion size and swelling in a swine model of traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock. We hypothesized that brain gene expression profiles after traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock would be modulated by FFP resuscitation.


STUDY DESIGN
Fifteen swine underwent a protocol of traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic shock and 2Â hours of shock followed by resuscitation with FFP, normal saline, or hetastarch (5/group). After 6 hours, brain RNA was isolated and hybridized onto a porcine gene ST 1.1 microarray. Weighted gene correlation network analysis was used to identify clusters of highly coexpressed genes. Principal component analysis identified cluster eigenvectors, indicating overall direction and magnitude of cluster gene expression. Using linear regression, cluster eigenvectors were associated with treatment as well as brain lesion size and swelling. Results were post-hoc corrected using false discovery rate. Relevant gene clusters were subjected to pathway analysis using the Reactome tool.


RESULTS
Network analysis identified 322 gene expression clusters (total of 12,462 coexpressed genes). Fresh frozen plasma resuscitation (but not normal saline or hetastarch) was positively associated with 2 distinct gene clusters (termed A and B) comprising 493 genes. Gene expression in both clusters was negatively associated with brain swelling, and cluster B was also negatively associated with lesion size. Pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of genes involved in metabolic and platelet signaling, as well as collagen formation and downregulation of inflammation.


CONCLUSIONS
Fresh frozen plasma resuscitation in this model was associated with downregulation of inflammatory pathway genes and expression of gene clusters mapping to increased metabolic and platelet signaling, which, in turn, was reversely associated with brain swelling.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin Sillesen"", ids = ""6212888""); list(name = ""Ted Bambakidis"", ids = ""7840499""); list(name = ""S E Dekker"", ids = ""145239305""); list(name = ""Yongqing Li"", ids = ""26730934""); list(name = ""Hasan B Alam"", ids = ""5106870"")",1396c314a253152155be39fbcd1fbd8b4fc2cbba; ef4a7dc396e5f3113bbb36a5c914412f01d06a8f; 711166eb801951966e7d8b88e8e12ecf5177c86e; 9a79167e77289097ec99eae4f447d757f5330fd1; b4eb027e942ac675e2523c65056381847430f5e3; 32a0ea137072a00128afee25838d808e43c4d69a,,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,224 1,"

b1598c4f9daee2adfce3d7753431f37a06ef05c0,Thresholding rules for recovering a sparse signal from microarray experiments.,"We consider array experiments that compare expression levels of a high number of genes in two cell lines with few repetitions and with no subject effect. We develop a statistical model that illustrates under which assumptions thresholding is optimal in the analysis of such microarray data. The results of our model explain the success of the empirical rule of two-fold change. We illustrate a thresholding procedure that is adaptive to the noise level of the experiment, the amount of genes analyzed, and the amount of genes that truly change expression level. This procedure, in a world of perfect knowledge on noise distribution, would allow reconstruction of a sparse signal, minimizing the false discovery rate. Given the amount of information actually available, the thresholding rule described provides a reasonable estimator for the change in expression of any gene in two compared cell lines.",2002,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chiara Sabatti"", ids = ""2139035""); list(name = ""Stanislav L Karsten"", ids = ""4965060""); list(name = ""Daniel H.

5276cd1dcaeb0cca3de79c1f4446b3311fcb09d6,Expression signature of lncRNAs and their potential roles in cardiac fibrosis of post-infarct mice,"The present study aimed to investigate whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in cardiac fibrogenesis induced by myocardial infarction (MI). The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in peri-infarct region of mice 4Â weeks after MI were selected for bioinformatic analysis including gene ontology (GO) enrichment, pathway and network analysis. Left ventricular tissue levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs were compared between MI and sham control mice, using a false discovery rate (FDR) of <5%. Out of 55000 lncRNAs detected, 263 were significantly up-regulated and 282 down-regulated. Out of 23000 mRNAs detected, 142 were significantly up-regulated and 67 down-regulated. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, 53 were up-regulated by â‰¥2.0-fold change and 37 down-regulated by â‰¤0.5-fold change. Nine up-regulated and five down-regulated lncRNAs were randomly selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) verification. GO and pathway analyses revealed 173 correlated lncRNA-mRNA pairs for 57 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 20 differentially expressed genes which are related to the development of cardiac fibrosis. We identified TGF-Î²3 as the top-ranked gene, a critical component of the transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways in cardiac fibrosis. NONMMUT022554 was identified as the top-ranked lncRNA, positively correlated with six up-regulated genes, which are involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions and the phosphoinositid-3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) signalling pathway.

5e99ece7bceadc347661ea7ffcfaa91d2f0b8e5b,Cyclin E1 Expression and Palbociclib Efficacy in Previously Treated Hormone Receptorâ€“Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer,"PURPOSE
A large-panel gene expression analysis was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with the effectiveness of adding palbociclib to fulvestrant.


METHODS
The PALOMA-3 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01942135) trial randomly assigned 521 endocrine-pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant. Primary analysis was first conducted on 10 genes on the basis of pathway biology and evidence from previous studies followed by a systematic panel-wide search among 2,534 cancer-related genes. The association of gene expression with the effect of palbociclib on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with gene expression as a continuous variable or dichotomized by median. An independent breast cancer cohort from the Preoperative Palbociclib (POP) Clinical Trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02008734) was used for validation, in 61 patients with primary breast cancer treated with 2 weeks of palbociclib.


RESULTS
In the PALOMA-3 trial, 302 patients had tumor tissue analyzed (palbociclib arm, 194 patients; placebo arm, 108 patients). Palbociclib efficacy was lower in patients with high versus low cyclin E1 (CCNE1) mRNA expression (median PFS: palbociclib arm, 7.6 v 14.1 months; placebo arm, 4.0 v 4.8 months, respectively; interaction P unadjusted = .00238; false discovery rate-adjusted P = .0238). CCNE1 mRNA was more predictive in metastatic than in archival primary biopsy tissue samples. No significant interaction was found between treatment and expression levels of CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1, and RB1. Palbociclib was efficacious in both luminal A and luminal B tumors. High CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with poor antiproliferative activity of palbociclib in the POP trial (P = .005).


CONCLUSION
Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant demonstrated efficacy in all biomarker groups, although high CCNE1 mRNA expression was associated with relative resistance to palbociclib.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicholas C.

If a multiple testing method is used, this is usually a standard familywise error rate (FWER) or false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure in which the logical relationships that exist between the different (self-contained) hypotheses are not taken into account. Taking those relationships into account, however, can lead to more powerful variants of existing multiple testing procedures and can make summarizing and interpreting the final results easier. We will show that, from the perspective of interpretation as well as from the perspective of power improvement, FWER controlling methods are more suitable than FDR controlling methods.

f1e7570781fba2ac576049f589308fcf794ec768,Re-sampling strategy to improve the estimation of number of null hypotheses in FDR control under strong correlation structures,"BackgroundWhen conducting multiple hypothesis tests, it is important to control the number of false positives, or the False Discovery Rate (FDR). However, there is a tradeoff between controlling FDR and maximizing power. Several methods have been proposed, such as the q-value method, to estimate the proportion of true null hypothesis among the tested hypotheses, and use this estimation in the control of FDR. These methods usually depend on the assumption that the test statistics are independent (or only weakly correlated). However, many types of data, for example microarray data, often contain large scale correlation structures. Our objective was to develop methods to control the FDR while maintaining a greater level of power in highly correlated datasets by improving the estimation of the proportion of null hypotheses.ResultsWe showed that when strong correlation exists among the data, which is common in microarray datasets, the estimation of the proportion of null hypotheses could be highly variable resulting in a high level of variation in the FDR. Therefore, we developed a re-sampling strategy to reduce the variation by breaking the correlations between gene expression values, then using a conservative strategy of selecting the upper quartile of the re-sampling estimations to obtain a strong control of FDR.ConclusionWith simulation studies and perturbations on actual microarray datasets, our method, compared to competing methods such as q-value, generated slightly biased estimates on the proportion of null hypotheses but with lower mean square errors. When selecting genes with controlling the same FDR level, our methods have on average a significantly lower false discovery rate in exchange for a minor reduction in the power.",2006,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Xin Lu"", ids = ""145574672""); list(name = ""David L.

In genetics, highly parallel genotyping arrays empower investigators to study associations of vast ensembles of biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with disease susceptibility and physiological responses to drugs and diet [1]. Risch and Merikangas [2] show that population association studies offer an important strategy for studying complex diseases, and they present an approach for estimating sample size for a categorical response, occurrence of disease. It is widely recognized that multiple comparisons can produce unacceptably high Type I error rates, producing false discoveries. It is not as widely recognized that the increase in sample size needed to account for multiple testing is relatively modest, increasing only logarithmically with the number of markers, thus remaining quite feasible even for genome-wide SNP arrays (approximately 100,000 SNPs). While Bonferroni adjustment is conservative compared with alternatives, such as the false discovery rate [3â€“5], it can be useful for study design [6]. Adapting Rosnerâ€™s formula for sample size [7], n, and an error function approximation [8] yields an approximate sample size estimate with Bonferroni adjustment of significance level, Î±/c in which Î± = significance level, and c = number of SNPs (see Box 1) and where and are variances of response under null and alternative hypotheses, Î² = Type II error, z =s tandard Ïƒ 0 2 Ïƒ 1 2",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Theodore Holford"", ids = ""3226774""); list(name = ""Andreas Windemuth"", ids = ""2284907""); list(name = ""Gualberto RuanÌƒo"", ids = ""3920238"")",8d790ba7c9f2231639a238b6697e5db2d1a60384; 9dde6de94909bd7f9f21c38c488cfd7aca53d44a; 118e463480948ca6919c8842d35f6ca79710a114; fc9c225aab0565c13dd7ceb0dc954ea0a81780ef; dcfca9019de6f119cbc34debee13692e0d199def,,Pharmacogenomics,7 2,"

f667c74f26023f08ad41c9b89632b86b5bf00750,Searching for differential expression: a non-parametric approach,"Microarray experiments are being widely used in medical and biological research. The main features of these studies are the large number of variables (genes) involved and the low number of replicates (arrays). It seems clear that the most appropriate models, when looking for detecting differences in gene expression are those that exploit the most useful information to compensate for the lack of replicates. On the other hand, the control of the error in the decision process plays an important role for the high number of simultaneous statistical tests (one for each gene), so that concepts such as the false discovery rate (FDR) take a special importance. One of the alternatives for the analysis of the data in these experiments is based on the calculation of statistics derived from modifications of the classical methods used in this type of problems (moderated-t, B-statistic). Nonparametric techniques have been also proposed [B. Efron, R. Tibshirani, J.D. Storey, and V. Tusher, Empirical Bayes analysis of a microarray experiment, J. Amer. Stat. Assoc. 96 (2001), pp. 1151â€“1160; W. Pan, J. Lin, and C.T. Le, A mixture model approach to detecting differentially expressed genes with microarray data, Funct. Integr. Genomics 3 (2003), pp. 117â€“124], allowing the analysis without assuming any prior condition about the distribution of the data, which make them especially suitable in such situations. This paper presents a new method to detect differentially expressed genes based on non-parametric density estimation by a class of functions that allow us to define a distance between individuals in the sample (characterized by the coordinates of the individual (gene) in the dual space tangent to the manifold of parameters) [A. MiÃ±arro and J.M. Oller, Some remarks on the individuals-score distance and its applications to statistical inference, QÃ¼estiiÃ³, 16 (1992), pp. 43â€“57].

The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is now widely used and is known to control the expectation of the FDP, called the false discovery rate (FDR). However, when the individual tests are correlated, controlling the FDR can be unsuitable to ensure that the actually achieved FDP is close (or below) the targeted level. This rises the question of controlling the quantiles of the distribution of the FDP, which is a challenging question that has received a growing attention in the recent literature. This paper elaborates upon the general principle let down by Romano and Wolf (2007) (RW) that builds FDP controlling procedures from $k$-family-wise error rate ($k$-FWE) controlling procedures, while incorporating known dependencies in an appropriate manner. This method is revisited as follows: first, choose a device to upper-bound the $k$-FWE, for all $k$. Second, build the corresponding critical values, possibly adaptively to the number $m_0$ of true null hypotheses. Third, use these critical values into a step-wise procedure (either step-down or step-up). The goal of the paper is to study the obtained FDP when using this methodology. Our first result provides sample finite bounds, while our second result is asymptotic in the number $m$ of hypotheses. Overall, this paper can be seen as a validation of RW's paradigm for controlling the FDP under dependence.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sylvain Delattre"", ids = ""2654204""); list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456"")",eb4de84ebab4df1d63c8982ef889eba81135ea5b,,,,

A substantial alteration in metabolic homeostasis is commonly observed in severe critical illness. We hypothesized that metabolic profiles significantly differ between critically ill patients relative to their level of plasma mtDNA.MethodsWe performed a metabolomic study with biorepository plasma samples collected from 73 adults with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis at a single academic medical center. Patients were treated in a 20-bed medical ICU between 2008 and 2010. To identify key metabolites and metabolic pathways related to plasma NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) mtDNA levels in critical illness, we first generated metabolomic data using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. We performed fold change analysis and volcano plot visualization based on false discovery rate-adjusted p values to evaluate the distribution of individual metabolite concentrations relative to ND1 mtDNA levels. We followed this by performing orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify individual metabolites that discriminated ND1 mtDNA groups. We then interrogated the entire metabolomic profile using pathway overrepresentation analysis to identify groups of metabolite pathways that were different relative to ND1 mtDNA levels.ResultsMetabolomic profiles significantly differed in critically ill patients with ND1 mtDNA levels â‰¥â€‰3200 copies/Î¼l plasma relative to those with an ND1 mtDNA level <â€‰3200 copies/Î¼l plasma. Several analytical strategies showed that patients with ND1 mtDNA levels â‰¥â€‰3200 copies/Î¼l plasma had significant decreases in glycerophosphocholines and increases in short-chain acylcarnitines.ConclusionsDifferential metabolic profiles during critical illness are associated with cell-free plasma ND1 mtDNA levels that are indicative of cell damage. Elevated plasma ND1 mtDNA levels are associated with decreases in glycerophosphocholines and increases in short-chain acylcarnitines that reflect phospholipid metabolism dysregulation and decreased mitochondrial function, respectively.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""PÃ¤r Ingemar Johansson"", ids = ""2969042""); list(name = ""Kiichi Nakahira"", ids = ""4328710""); list(name = ""Angela J Rogers"", ids = ""35113854""); list(name = ""Michael J.

Methods: Pooled analyses included all treatment regimens (NIVO 3 mg/kg, NIVO 1 mg/kg + IPI 3 mg/kg, NIVO 3 mg/kg + IPI 1 mg/kg, and patients treated with NIVO 1 mg/kg + IPI 1 mg/kg in the dose-escalation phase). PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC; Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay) was used to evaluate tumor PD-L1 expression, referred to as tumor proportion score (TPS). Combined positive score (CPS) was determined by evaluating PD-L1 expression on previously stained IHC slides using the CPS algorithm. Gene expression profiling (GEP) by RNA sequencing was used to evaluate immune cell activation and infiltration signatures, a Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) inflammatory signature, and PD-L1 gene expression. Results: The pooled CPS (N = 104), TPS (N = 130), and GEP (N = 40) cohorts were mostly representative of the overall CheckMate 032 mGEC cohort (N =163). At a median (range) follow-up of 23.4 (17.0-35.4) months, CPS at higher cutoffs correlated better with efficacy and had higher prevalence than TPS in all analyses (Table). For all immune gene signatures examined, responders had higher signature scores in aggregate. For the BMS inflammatory signature, the association between signature score and response was significant (P = 0.004; false discovery rate = 0.037). Conclusions: CPS demonstrated stronger association with efficacy of NIVO Â± IPI than TPS in mGEC. Prevalence of CPS was higher than that of TPS. Among immune gene signatures examined, the BMS inflammatory signature achieved the best association with efficacy and warrants further investigation.

c7536abee427907bd8455de9ed7f53011cc8e8dc,ER regulates an evolutionarily conserved apoptosis pathway.,"Estrogen receptor (ER) is regarded as a major causal factor in breast cancer and FoxA1, a winged-helix transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family, has been found to function as a pioneer factor in the recruitment of ER to several cis-regulatory elements in the genome. High throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation analyzed by hybridization to microarrays (ChIP-chip) can reveal ER and FoxA1 binding sites occupied by transcription factors. However, these results are blind to lineage-specific cis-regulatory elements. In this study, we identified ER and FoxA1 binding sites conserved in evolution by using Detection of LinEage-Specific Selection (DLESS) method. We also analyzed target genes close to conserved cis-regulatory elements by combining gene-expression data. A total of 7877 ER binding sites and 18,135 FoxA1 binding sites were identified in MCF-7 cells by performing an unbiased genome-wide ChIP-chip with False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5%. Using DLESS method, we found target candidate genes closest to fully conserved cis-regulatory elements related to apoptosis according to gene ontology analysis. Furthermore, network analysis of apoptosis-related genes within 10 kb of fully conserved cis-regulatory elements was constructed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Apoptosis genes in the network showed over- and under-expression in MCF-7 cell-line. And these apoptosis-related genes closest to fully conserved cis-regulatory elements in network showed strong correlation with ER in MCF-7 cells. These results elucidate that ER regulates an evolutionarily conserved apoptosis pathway. This opens up new perspectives in the apoptosis of human breast cancer from the evolution of cis-regulatory elements.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhihua Liu"", ids = ""40004417""); list(name = ""Shilin Chen"", ids = ""1908494"")",fdc18d00d9c927f91b25d156de72b28a43033299; 979a79b849c991fe3bf35fb159e547182e4bd775; f4b5e350114c8aa765bddee00214bd396d42ea08; 77e76f68f52c26d7c8af86f8eefbdb3a1a68bd49; 82da5b8629603632acddbd1bdb82290af3cc23b2; ce58a244c076ce7673c45754e750a030b7e01f25; d9c855b0ede5a47d96904555b62d0d903a13bced; af48d894a134ce054eab3eba37ce8e1867384116; 14805c269d667feb119d1dbe3549300c336824c4; e00aff4a796d4013ee8fdbed2c8439c0f713437a; f0e01f62a57b7e0a72b4073edf487a3d4ef664e3; b54a746cf86f6b6d4811996d4e926e15316e8a8a; 6af56ead2167737da57dbbdda00c04ce37bafa36,,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,400 1,"

The crosslinking analysis determines distance restraints between two covalently linked amino acids which are typically summarized in a table format that precludes the immediate and comprehensive interpretation of the topological data. xVis displays crosslinks in clear schematic representations in form of a circular, bar or network diagram. The interactive graphs indicate the linkage sites and identification scores, depict the spatial proximity of structurally and functionally annotated protein regions and the evolutionary conservation of amino acidsÂ and facilitate clustering of proteins into subcomplexes according to the crosslink density. Furthermore, xVis offers two options for the qualitative assessment of the crosslink identifications by filtering crosslinks according to identification scores or false discovery rates and by displaying the corresponding fragment ion spectrum of each crosslink for the manual validation of the mass spectrometric data. Our web server provides an easy-to-use tool for the fast topological and functional interpretation of distance information on protein complex architectures and for the evaluation of crosslink fragment ion spectra. xVis is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license at http://xvis.genzentrum.lmu.de/.",2015,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Maximilian Grimm"", ids = ""3409544""); list(name = ""Tomasz Zimniak"", ids = ""3409821""); list(name = ""Abdullah Kahraman"", ids = ""50589765""); list(name = ""Franz Herzog"", ids = ""34951223"")",4f753c90815a048e5dffc618ceeb5616eaa03de8; 0549d0184ebad367a42bfcb4029acd1dd13648ad; 3e6e786f59d50544bae481074fc4339a4ea45e8d; 68e8e365ceb4b2d2c9edf4c0c272e428b333dc88; ff2fec65b07b93abac6f74ba19ce8e92e9d8ba3a; e1377d968f7fd4f2b3a39b1a697d608ae6d5e291; 002feed10b76678dc9399f48b3fe9c98562a9a6f; a256276daa8134ef5b35038672151cd879ad0a64; dca29360785430f68c146c27da36da471a545866; fc0fbaa3a3f16caadfe514a76c4c7cbc9b3cf8bd; 63b640fcef71e8da3a5132108cf742a30180fef0; 8bd069aa908bc3527ec3fd8097ec7c829ed28945; 6948ab1295e2f5fb99ee93a87bd0e109ee176d31; 7934aae8d0779c46a0e5b439f76ae3522933fb0e; 1808b0c852dccbaffc450c4d894e4b4b907c6f15; 45428bb6beb2c570f0e97e7317ff41ab0eb7d70c; ec807a34896f0de679a37a2e540d7e5093ad52b4; e0baff5da2e43ddf2bfe4f2ca4a5ba8e783d2660; e09158d7cb1ebc7f5b7d188ad630cf10417e9aa7; 99c66e19ef236d4bb56515b34d930742be15fc03; d8fcbce02faf358c47c96c1233f97b70e236e89f; c728ad954103880828ec8113f7b34541717e3b22; cee212784df52a37ba5f098abbbf984eeb34d13c; 8e01806ea0228e308e4be3c74d32c370a0393d86; ca278a4cd769721bb148f9fcc9d6e34446b090e4; 19c4f188b4782e11e2c22330c1a2229b388ca78b; c3b9dfecaa0562da3b529d511ef036156740b83c; 8773d9fc1a10a15911f97ad4209417f01e77d6c0; 6109ba11bb6be39d11ed31e2acd805d938c6cbf1; 85e0058ec4ebeb960c9710d4807f7adee5e49445; 2b453bc9c6349ba69b38155546e701840316bbdd; 6920c6b6df5f4ac22619f3582dedb43faf5ebdb5; eced1b1c59ea2d474bc852882bed8952771d6445; 55aaebc419d3ad489798dfd5a5857b84d25985a3; 7ad643ed57e640d3e8ca902b2e7f3f7c4ce8badf; 00e129fa3f9171f994a00db95b458be4dc050899; cb408dc36ab4cfdf752a80749e353b54adaf7004; 0cf4cf5ea6dfb6eb913555eff512a56ba0b818b0; 703c7508762658f42998449154a9cf47a5b19b1a; 8c087f83437b3d9610517591964245f4c5c5a191; cb3490d4101e4c4c37a2430284aa3e99606ce6b1; a63297224455556c8762ec9c2867e1f3edcd158a; 57c49d8ff1c74fe5c4af79b1727bd059f155a7ee; ddd969da51fd124720298720af2b0d9d7ec8c190; 504e561403eb5d2330226f316cfe90fdd836501e,64e94e4bb579f0924652cdb3a80ae7d8e49907c5; 953e7acb8a9ae772ac8ce3b3c7426166a339bfc3; bdf3f3cbf738f0f4674355e58ae2f35ff8df6b74; 1783e2da0f2a0bf97dd57c7b10e27b9d91116d23; 465adb54c57a4c1175b3eb9c1ecac1a836d1373e; 833accc57f74d7fec98e1a512185a44a82ce35b2; 9ef2f6d3261c3da5d704f4720d009c848edb634c; 8309fc8a86ba919aee9b138486c42d294337973c; d6a7eccfb1134485985179dde91f2ba78d45ab5d; 3917bb129d9b6cbd311870798e6e6fdade97462b; 2046454a49e45f8e096739c93b3a7d10f566a1c0; fca56dd6dd2b155361b9c7ec3196280a227cd0fa; 9ff4797e2c79b67621306e834f447ead2dc42421; 7b7543b473fc62c6d1375f3af581ed27d175af8c; 21b580eee5030edc2981f96fc223534316d6c86b; 35b0a607eda9a0a23ee631faced825383222a68e; 05530ba77b6a8444a01b41078a09a0f23b7ff823; f90560898a52a02587229f54950117046f497fdf; 64f8e434c3e2d340a36243eae19d3e4b79f2e992; a3df6588a84ee06fe1c9653040e44eede03edc32; 27577b2972dae95f2315b54b652bc1d1eb5c9991; ef05628ed2f8068246e837ae20991bbf0c78fc42; 10b6dabb616754fedced9ed396bbbef9abb0a0a6; acfdfec116700dae78f9409c19f1c11941c5cd1b; 452f510d80653be529ffcd2408f2a31df8cb85a0; fa12fbf96757d62a2eee7d6ead3503cd9ae387a9; 5d628899674d3491fca8b3d7022318cf96eb0045,Nucleic Acids Research,43,W362 - W369
63bbd7df38ad93c0efb2927883368732054663fe,Learning brain connectivity with the false-discovery-rate-controlled PC-algorithm,"Discovering the connectivity networks in the brain, i.e. the neural influence that brain regions exert over one another, has attracted increasing research attention in studies on brain functions. An important error rate criterion on the discovered network is the false discovery rate (FDR), that is the expected ratio of the falsely â€œdiscoveredâ€ connections to all those â€œdiscoveredâ€. Very recently, we have developed an algorithm that is able to control the FDR under a given level q at the limit of large sample size, and its modification that controlled the FDR accurately in simulations with moderate sample sizes [1]. However, the algorithms do not consider prior knowledge on the network structure, and can not be applied to models such as dynamic Bayesian networks. In this paper, we extend the algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge, and demonstrate how to apply the extended algorithm to learning the structure of dynamic Bayesian networks from continuous data. Its application to a real functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging (fMRI) data set revealed that Parkinson's disease patients' brain connectivities are normalized by L-dopa medication.

Currently, the diagnosis of male infertility depends on the results of semen quality or requires invasive surgical intervention. The process is complex and time-consuming. Metabolomics is an emerging platform with unique advantages in disease diagnosis and pathological mechanism research. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-ion trap-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-IT-TOFMS) combined with chemometrics methods was used to discover potential biomarkers of male infertility based on non-targeted plasma metabolomics. Plasma samples from healthy controls (HC, n = 43) and various types of infertile patients, i.e., patients having oligozoospermia (OS, n = 36), asthenospermia (AS, n = 56) and erectile dysfunction (ED, n = 45) were analyzed by UPLC-ESI-IT-TOFMS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed. The results of OPLS-DA showed that HCs could be discriminated from infertile patients including OS (R2 = 0.903, Q2 = 0.617, AUC = 0.992), AS (R2 = 0.985, Q2 = 0.658, AUC = 0.999) or ED (R2 = 0.942, Q2 = 0.500, AUC = 0.998). Some potential biomarkers were successfully discovered by variable selection methods and variable important in the projection (VIP) in combination with the T-test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05; the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg false discovery rate was used to reduce type 1 errors resulting from multiple comparisons. The identified biomarkers were associated with energy consumption, hormone regulation and antioxidant defenses in spermatogenesis. To elucidate the pathophysiology of male infertility, relative metabolic pathways were studied. It was found that male infertility is closely related to disturbed phospholipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis metabolism, metabolism of fatty acids and products of carnitine acylation, and purine and pyrimidine metabolisms.

We hypothesized that changes in the expression of miRNAs could provide important post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during hypometabolism via control over mRNA translation. The present study analyzed profiles of miRNA expression in the sea cucumber respiratory tree using Solexa deep sequencing technology. We identified 279 sea cucumber miRNAs, including 15 novel miRNAs specific to sea cucumber. Animals sampled during deep aestivation (DA; after at least 15 days of continuous torpor) were compared with animals from a non-aestivation (NA) state (animals that had passed through aestivation and returned to an active state). We identified 30 differentially expressed miRNAs ([RPM (reads per million) >10, |FC| (|fold change|)â‰¥1, FDR (false discovery rate)<0.01]) during aestivation, which were validated by two other miRNA profiling methods: miRNA microarray and real-time PCR. Among the most prominent miRNA species, miR-124, miR-124-3p, miR-79, miR-9 and miR-2010 were significantly over-expressed during deep aestivation compared with non-aestivation animals, suggesting that these miRNAs may play important roles in metabolic rate suppression during aestivation.

When analysing data which simultaneously implicate a large number of statistical tests, one of the main problems is to take into account the multiplicity of these tests. The huge amount of comparisons done in studies of which the aim is to detect, using microarray, genes whose transcriptional changes are related to a biological or clinical outcome leads to a renewed interest for the multiple comparisons problem. However, this problem concerns many other fields such as psychometry, epidemiology, genetics.


RESULTS
First, we introduce the multiple comparison framework. Then, we present the main procedures based on a global error rate called the ""Family Wise Error Rate"" (FWER) and those based on a false discovery rate expectancy (the ""False Discovery Rate"" (FDR) and the ""positive False Discovery Rate"" (pFDR)). Next, we apply the different procedures on a real dataset from a breast carcinoma study. Finally, we discuss the main results and we present guidelines for the use of these procedures.",2004,Medicine,"list(name = ""Cyril Dalmasso"", ids = ""4379542""); list(name = ""Philippe BroÃ«t"", ids = ""3170825""); list(name = ""Thierry Moreau"", ids = ""2368623"")",3ce957049305e3fc9ee6e28dbc1c824dfdf80a10,,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,52 6,"

The objective of this research study is to validate the hypothesis, if and how the WMH influences brain connectivity in a population with carotid artery stenosis (CAS), which are eligible for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We used resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) magnetic resonance (MR) to validate our hypothesis, focusing on the effects of the total number of WMH (TNWMH) and of the WMH Burden (WMHB). Twenty-three patients (sixteen males and seven females, mean age 74.34 years) with mono or bilateral carotid stenosis eligible for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), underwent an MR examination on a 1.5-T scanner. The protocol included a morphologic T1-3D isotropic, an EPI functional sequence for rs-fc MR analysis, and a 3D isotropic FLAIR sequence. For each patient, the TNWMH and the WMHB were obtained using two online toolsâ€”volBrain and lesionBrain. The rs-fc region-of-interest to region-of-interest (ROI-to-ROI) analysis was performed with the CONN toolbox v18a: two different multiple regression analyses including both WMHB and TNWMH as second-level covariates evaluated the individual effects of WMHB (Analysis A) and TNWMH (Analysis B), adopting a p value corrected for false discovery rate (p-FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05 to identify statistically significant values. Both analyses A and B identified several statistically significant positive and negative correlations associated with WMHB and TNWMH.

ce76153bae88d30f0cfd2c9fdeef5620e6b66923,Variation in sex steroid methyl transferases associated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) efficacy in advanced prostate cancer.,"4647 Background: The association of germline variation in genes regulating hormonal pathways with duration of treatment response in advanced prostate cancer patients receiving ADT was evaluated, focusing on genes in the androgen biosynthesis (the C4 Î”; C5 Î”; C21 CYP pathways and the alternate ""backdoor pathway"") and metabolism pathways.


METHODS
We successfully genotyped 747 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 84 genes in a cohort of 304 patients with advanced prostate cancer who progressed on ADT. Tagging SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of >5% and r2 â‰¥0.8 were selected from HapMap, NIEHS and Seattle SNP databases. The primary endpoint was time to ADT failure, and we conducted a gene-level test (principal components), along with individual SNP level tests adjusted for patient age and Gleason score. To account for multiple testing, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR), and FDRs of 0.10 were considered noteworthy.


RESULTS
The median age of the cohort at ADT failure was 72 years (range 65-78 years), and the overall median time to ADT failure was 3.21 years (IQ (25-75): 1.54-6.20 years). At the gene level, TRMT11 (tRNA methyltransferase 11 homologue) showed the strongest association with time to ADT failure (p<0.0008; adjusted p-value for FDR-0.068). Two of four TRMT11 tag SNPs were associated with time to ADT failure. The first was the intronic SNP rs1268121 (A>G) with a MAF of 15%, for which there was a positive association of median time to ADT failure with the number of variant alleles (p=0.023): 3.1 years for 0, 4.1 years for 1, and 5.9 years for 2 variant alleles. The second was the SNP rs6900796 (A>G) in the 3' untranscribed region with a MAF of 49%, for which the median time to ADT failure was 2.6 years for 0, 2.5 years for 1, and 3.8 years for 2 variant alleles (p=0.023). Four additional genes showed an association with ADT response at the p<0.10 level, including LOC390956, PRMT3, SLC7A6OS, and WBSCR22, although all FDRs were >0.95.


CONCLUSIONS
Variation in TRMT11 was associated with time to ADT failure. Confirmation of these findings in an independent cohort is needed.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Manish Kohli"", ids = ""144503041""); list(name = ""Doug W.

It has been suggested that high vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) as vegetables and fruit are rich in antioxidants. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interaction of vegetable and fruit intake with genetic polymorphisms in oxidative stress pathway genes and NHL risk. This hypothesis was investigated in a population-based case-control study of NHL and NHL histologic subtypes in women from Connecticut, including 513 histologically confirmed incident cases and 591 randomly selected controls. Gene-vegetable/fruit joint effects were estimated using unconditional logistic regression model. The false discovery rate method was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Significant interactions with vegetable and fruit intake were mainly found for genetic polymorphisms on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) genes among those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NOS1 gene were found to significantly modify the association between total vegetable and fruit intake and risk of NHL overall, as well as the risk of follicular lymphoma. When vegetables, bean vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, green leafy vegetables, red vegetables, yellow/orange vegetables, fruit, and citrus fruits were examined separately, strong interaction effects were narrowed to vegetable intake among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

70d15b78010c4bdeae88fcfb17ae8bc2197bcd27,Predictive Effects of Lung function test on Postoperative Pneumonia in Squamous Esophageal Cancer,"Pulmonary function tests had prospective implications for postoperative pneumonia, which occurred frequently after esophagectomy. Understanding factors that were associated with pulmonary infection may help in patient selection and postoperative management. We performed a retrospective review of 2 independent cohorts including 216 patients who underwent esophagectomy between November 2011 and May 2014, aiming at identifying predictors of primary pneumonia. Univariate analysis was used to identify potential covariates for the development of primary pneumonia. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Holm-Bonferroni method). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors and construct a regression model based on a training cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰166) and then the regression model was validated using an independent cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰50). It showed that low PEF (hazard ratio 0.97, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.009) was independent risk factors for the development of primary pneumonia in multivariate analyses and had a predictive effect for primary pneumonia (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.691 and 0.851 for training and validation data set, respectively). Therefore, PEF has clinical value in predicting postoperative pneumonia after esophagectomy and it may serve as an indicator of preoperative lung function training.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ran Wei"", ids = ""152708758""); list(name = ""Wei Dong"", ids = ""144980063""); list(name = ""Hongchang Shen"", ids = ""4390153""); list(name = ""Yang Ni"", ids = ""1986281""); list(name = ""Tiehong Zhang"", ids = ""6942301""); list(name = ""Yibing Wang"", ids = ""1707682""); list(name = ""Jiajun Du"", ids = ""4760298"")",9eff55256443b45b196318ea45b89b7cd16a4b84; 191b4ed57a551158d864f480e8f989ed124dcaef; 4999acb539beedb7d89b1ebc68d1a67d2c52fb95; 32537897ff3b9cb263a75b5f57260678c426034c; 36a190ae33a4aefad1fbf061d09a536b1521541e; 46d777bac7f17ede731197b09068646139398af9,dcf8a77ae18b6653f6d327368c1933904865f26b; 29141eaed2fff2e9e9e89067ca5a7221f55e77cf; 8b5ed81be9a7a40ced7da02de05fb613411774f3; a4d42c3e748fc808350619bbdb914c85985761df; 9d35eee37a0387ba0b77ee417b13f86fb18c7ba5; a78d7ceba8296ebca818cab9fcd4dbe1d1bd1baf; 34fa4d5a58304b9231db6471411df2a1c8dd7fd3; 3e17bfc8cae7bf3364d8364aa4abed7d8d5b23c5; 18f70de4efb767696ac562774c0423b4e0fcd787; c69e9e367d3ef13cc57398c7f4d13e1e9ff0cd86; e378bc3969102fb83b94b5fac41c69de07be3417; c763b75af730c96dd10d73d1c14b06315ab26e49; f8fd6bd37cbfaa9ab8386a6cd432e4be328388a2; 00ce6a099a122c9e2703c067de8df03e2b669e7f; a587713ef708a86b0dbb10dc86cf52753b600d3e; a4b39c4c62c3f7ef054a74f770baa0ad67b2d5b4; af4f441be09b8705d1f313937644e5afcd8e3f0c; 9f158932e56796abaa004dcb8c68a6efff634589; b06271d8fbcefae4c092486685a9789190acf777; f7e7616bef2f7509e5c406f4864f607f020887ba; 604eeeeb5fffb37aa1dcd00887ff7988190accc2; c0de061623da1bea79ef69a2b6851e17bcf2633d; e7169b7458562598034a40684900d2895de226c5,Scientific Reports,6,

36936245f10b341dbc2f224fbbd525b0ddb8c4eb,Peripheral blood RNA gene expression profiling in the patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis,"Objectives: We aimed to describe the genetic pathways activated during the community acquired bacterial meningitis (BM) and healthy controls by using genome-wide RNA expression profiling combined with functional annotation of transcritpional changes. S518 20th ECCMID, Posters Study was performed in 21 patients with BM and their data were compared with eighteen age and sex matched healthy controls. 
 
Methods: We included 21 patients (median age 56.1 years) with culture proven BM hospitalised between the 1st of January and 31st of December 2008. The control group consisted of 18 age and sex matched subjects (median age 55.3 years). The blood samples were collected via venepuncture on admission. The RNA was extracted from whole blood, a and b globin mRNA was depleted and gene expression profiling was performed with GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) enabling the analysis of 28,869 genes. To verify the genechip results, we chose ten genes (CD177, IL1R2, IL18R1, IL18RAP, OLFM4, TLR5, CPA3, FCER1A, IL5RA, IL7R) from the gene expression profiling data and performed further analyse with real-time (RT) PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR successfully verified previously found differences. Gene expression profile data was analysed by Bayesian modelling. To define changed genetic networks functional annotation of enriched gene sets was used. 
 
Results: BM was mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumonia (14) followed by Neisseria meningitidis (2) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2). Comparing the controls with the patients, we identified the significant changes at p values of <0.05 in 8569 genes, after False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction total of 5500 genes remained significant at p value of <0.01. Functional annotation and network analysis indicated that most of the genes were related to activation of inflammatory processes. Next common of the upregulated genes were responsible for allergic reactions and anaphylaxia. Those changes were seen in our study both among the adults and the children. 
 
Conclusion: This study demonstrates a strong functional evidence of the activated immune response. This may indicate that the protective reactions caused by severe and active infection are even too strong.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Margit Lill"", ids = ""6912626""); list(name = ""Sulev KÃµks"", ids = ""4095225""); list(name = ""Ursel Soomets"", ids = ""6788898""); list(name = ""Leonard C.

f6e3321c4319da09159106fcb1b08bb849e9a562,Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Membrane Proteins in Enterococcus faecalis With Low-Level Linezolid-Resistance,"Despite increasing reports of low-level linezolid-resistant enterococci worldwide, the mechanism of this resistance remains poorly understood. Previous transcriptome studies of low-level linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis isolates have demonstrated a number of significantly up-regulated genes potentially involved in mediation of drug resistance. However, whether the transcriptome faithfully reflects the proteome remains unknown. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis of membrane proteins in an E. faecalis isolate (P10748) with low-level linezolid-resistance in comparison with two linezolid-susceptible strains 3138 and ATCC 29212, all of which have been previously investigated by whole transcriptome analysis. A total of 8,197 peptides associated with 1,170 proteins were identified in all three isolates with false discovery rate (FDR) at 1% and P < 0.05. There were 14 significantly up-regulated and 6 significantly down-regulated proteins in strain P10748 compared to strains 3138 and ATCC 29212, which were in general positively correlated with transcription levels revealed in previous transcriptome studies. Our analysis suggests that the low-level linezolid-resistance in E. faecalis is conferred primarily by the ATP-binding cassette protein OptrA through ribosomal protection and, possibly, also by the enterococcal surface protein (Esp) and other proteins through biofilm formation. The genetic transfer of optrA is potentially regulated by the surface exclusion protein Sea1, conjugal transfer protein TraB, replication protein RepA and XRE family transcription regulator protein. This report represents the first investigation of the mechanisms of linezolid-resistance in E. faecalis by a quantitative proteomics approach.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jia Chuan Yan"", ids = ""49781382""); list(name = ""Yun Xia"", ids = ""47778229""); list(name = ""Mi Yang"", ids = ""47345434""); list(name = ""Jiaqi Zou"", ids = ""36689353""); list(name = ""Yingzhu Chen"", ids = ""50580982""); list(name = ""Dawei Zhang"", ids = ""39471462""); list(name = ""Liang Ma"", ids = ""50709798"")",badef0c7820a8a2f337ada3fd01f493973c2c2c8,90ebac6e6d2718708780d03896116b729cf0766c; a33bdcd2114aa1761986ca88680b6da60a837728; 7ff55c2d97b590b19b7117448ef3be043dbc6e8f; a0e0bde8defb745e2cb55bafe4a131f6524f31e5; bc2884dd19de61856124e5f3c0480a871d1f0784; 69059fc2d9b9fd61b5b05a81112db27175769d2a; 4659c3bfe9cb41369c20b0e2e05eede964f88827; f28c810706f64d9c55d7b814d36552decabb528e; 966a8817553559066877883c874153a4c1134426; 6b21597b174d60cef10e98522dc81fc998dda1c6; 13901d8fd6b03a0b95ce10da79203c66c9e3b442; b66d3622d278b24dfa488f52718490fc046c742d; c13d0ceef599f79237f8dd9176acf5e1b2d8c9ee; 754c08e6133955bdde80f4d003d201fcc624f56d; bdb88042bdba306a05ccb8dfb76ca840576cd3f7; 2228878e26a0d68043e97f107f9629d58808817c; 099ee084cd268c2e298fbd23a97ec61abf848505; 2a9a4f730e4834695deeab556b41332d22680b63; 4f87566f5059c9b182668c60b80ee85ebb344021; f1c70ed9c8f3a9724a0e18f47d098bf4f6d017ac; 8201dede251fe54f735da7cf88747255281e4653; 1cf6f2e6a18dc57a3b587fe1eb04fc309720564b; ca0e14e1ab549c0581e9266f8317c803ded20161; f2f47c65f42d61e5b926ca85690e2a54bf0a2659; 9a0da5468359a1317ecce4e033a8f298ac0eb24d; f3022a55c0b7daeb279d39b0d3f23f6493330f32; a35712e0aeef55eceaed8777158546c21edc6e7f; 74007ce90fa4ee7863118014446a120c34f32561; 0dcd5da250fa9e34b06a307822e205bc427f8132; e5331840c124105765e193648dfac7ea0e530b86; 39674fa7a7d6a8ef278b6aef2de8a1ee4bf44fc4; accf0f94b954b451a89fc1893f4720fa5d957d77; 02089a851b318d02667e41e70ce0c0e65f2d91d1; 3b3384926168e7af70d71e65073088024e28278f; ee8519876b6643104932e686cde910945d84fe51; 27e7f3a6bcdfb6e23aaa393f5cbe0df278193c7d; 119839d2861f7293f7a982a421a577799a9dcac6; 29f1c6694cbae5a3aff420940319dc39f7635a28; 7f71490ffecd2f2e4cfb508ab15129f0af7df7b2; 23f045ab4fc0ef98b580ccf75c3a81b3411647ec; 14cf3891369167fd0cdfc08c73ba5b809acf1dc1; 49e4ae7981f1aa28f10eac6b3681310dca31f89d; 66beefd7248b490bb553ee0ab2da33a063fd866a; 5ae443b6728e783852c3f2ee4853c046277ad8b5; 51da97ac048634c87c91a93f255f4c2cafc5505c; d87181979335015f321a785a44c4384a04271e53; b30129decde4e1b7c74d61fe93000baf44f9adc5; 1919e1a4145509ff73806c0f406cf14cf7abff44; 69b62e0060549fc86cfab8e914d45262e64be10b; 73b2d3c2e0a34d21ca074836e5b4b06de247cf8a; f0c02415decf7cfa618d1d17611bb82d97477f85; ba45cf426ab33dfcaf22f2a34febe9d90dc536be; 96cb011b14dccf4acbf1f53ed4f76c26e8ff3a67; 08ff997bd7ab1c73f1b58cfa9ebed0b41900fd80; d35fe208a5b7edaadd5b3854470d1f7dcc88b5f0; 250b66205e0a5c098cd758b064db8e45a5857069; 3219856fce0280bda21915b03bc5f92146d38931; 7b53e08fde766a8890cc66b1616f3b13dd0d35b2; 5cb639e57f2b7620267bdfeaf7525dee70a74551; 22e512c3bba352e1cda01c7f17264169dac3779d; f4af952c166cf477546abf5361a71da00e3f7c9e; e83a7bec325c73c30f18849248e7db957f893a19,Frontiers in Microbiology,9,
339a5122235589c1d8bcad910983b14269d1a2a1,A hierarchical statistical model to assess the confidence of peptides and proteins inferred from tandem mass spectrometry,"MOTIVATION
Statistical evaluation of the confidence of peptide and protein identifications made by tandem mass spectrometry is a critical component for appropriately interpreting the experimental data and conducting downstream analysis. Although many approaches have been developed to assign confidence measure from different perspectives, a unified statistical framework that integrates the uncertainty of peptides and proteins is still missing.


RESULTS
We developed a hierarchical statistical model (HSM) that jointly models the uncertainty of the identified peptides and proteins and can be applied to any scoring system. With data sets of a standard mixture and the yeast proteome, we demonstrate that the HSM offers a reliable or at least conservative false discovery rate (FDR) estimate for peptide and protein identifications. The probability measure of HSM also offers a powerful discriminating score for peptide identification.

6a7640b0cf1164b75c055a67711ad28267df607a,Variation in 24 hemostatic genes and associations with non-fatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.,"BACKGROUND
Arterial thrombosis involves platelet aggregation and clot formation, yet little is known about the contribution of genetic variation in fibrin-based hemostatic factors to arterial clotting risk. We hypothesized that common variation in 24 coagulation-fibrinolysis genes would contribute to risk of incident myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke (IS).


METHODS
We conducted a population-based, case-control study. Subjects were hypertensive adults and postmenopausal women 30-79 years of age, who sustained a first MI (n = 856) or IS (n = 368) between 1995 and 2002, and controls matched on age, hypertension status, and calendar year (n = 2,689). We investigated the risk of MI and IS associated with (i) global variation within each gene as measured by common haplotypes and (ii) individual haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Significance was assessed using a 0.2 threshold of the false discovery rate q-value, which accounts for multiple testing.


RESULTS
After accounting for multiple testing, global genetic variation in factor (F) VIII was associated with IS risk. Two haplotypes in FVIII and one in FXIIIa1 were significantly associated with increased IS risk (all q-values < 0.2). A plasminogen gene SNP was associated with MI risk. All are new discoveries not previously reported. Another 24 tests had P-values < 0.05 and q-values > 0.2 in MI and IS analyses, 23 of which are new and hypothesis generating.


CONCLUSIONS
Apart from the association of FVIII variation with IS, we found little evidence that common variation in the 24 candidate fibrin-based hemostasis genes strongly influences arterial thrombotic risk, but our results cannot rule out small effects.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicholas L.

0f7ebb0631afa4968d248c629cfdc2617736394d,Genome-Wide Association Mapping Reveals Novel QTL for Seedling Leaf Rust Resistance in a Worldwide Collection of Winter Wheat.,"Leaf rust of wheat ( L.) is a major disease that causes significant yield losses worldwide. The short-lived nature of leaf rust resistance () genes necessitates a continuous search for novel sources of resistance. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a panel of 1596 wheat accessions. The panel was evaluated for leaf rust reaction by testing with a bulk of Eriks. () isolates collected from multiple fields of Oklahoma in 2013 and two predominant races in the fields of Oklahoma in 2015. The panel was genotyped with a set of 5011 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 14 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf rust resistance were identified at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 using the mixed linear model (MLM). Of these, eight QTL reside in the vicinity of known genes or QTL, and more studies are needed to determine their relationship with known loci. is a new QTL to bread wheat but is close to a locus previously identified in durum wheat [ L. subsp. (Desf.) Husn.]. The other five QTL, including , , , , and , are likely novel loci for leaf rust resistance. The uneven distribution of the 14 QTL in the six subpopulations of the panel suggests that wheat breeders can enhance leaf rust resistance by selectively introgressing some of these QTL into their breeding materials. In addition, another 31 QTL were significantly associated with leaf rust resistance at a FDR of 0.05.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Gen-qiao Li"", ids = ""89001392""); list(name = ""Xiaoj Xu"", ids = ""12186709""); list(name = ""Guihua Bai"", ids = ""84341121""); list(name = ""Brett F.

We also review the utility of linkage disequilibrium data in gene mapping in isolated populations, in the estimation of recombination rates and in studying the history of particular alleles, including the detection of natural selection. We discuss current understanding of the extent and patterns of linkage disequilibrium in the genome, and its promise for genetic association studies in complex disease.

933d80f69951d7e6b75e1ed4af5dc55fb97be6cd,An Electrophysiological Study on Sex-Related Differences in Emotion Perception,"The purpose of this research project was examine the following question: Do men and women respond differently, on a neurophysiological level, to stimuli that elicit an emotional valence? Participants completed an emotional expression face identification task in which participants made speeded responses to angry, happy, and neutral emotional faces. Behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) methods were utilized to examine emotion processing differences between females and males and whether those differences were associated with emotional arousal or emotion regulation differences. Results indicated that females and males did not differ in accuracy or response time. Furthermore, there were no observable differences in the P1 ERP waveform reflecting emotional arousal or the P3 waveform reflecting emotional regulation between female and male adults. Therefore, we did not find evidence for differential emotional arousal and emotion regulation processes between females and males. Running Head: SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PERCEPTION !3 Background/Context Past individual difference research on emotional identification has examined attentional capacity (Shaw et al. 2011), age differences (Pollock et al. 2012; Houston et al. in 2018a), medical conditions (Houston et al., 2018b), and personality abnormalities (Levant et al. 2014; Jardin et al., in preparation). However, limited research exists in regard to how these mechanisms differ based on gender. In the existing research on gender differences in emotional processing, Gard & Kring (2007) found that men and women do differ in emotional expressivity, and that this difference may be due to gender differences in approach-avoidance motivational systems, which supports the idea that differences in emotional expressivity is not merely due to social constructs of gender. This study was limited in that it used self-report data, as well as electromyographic (EMG) recordings. These measures lack the ability to observe differences in the processing of emotions that exist at a cognitive level. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is an effective way to study emotional arousal and regulation because it has the ability to measure, with high temporal resolution, the brainâ€™s response to a stimulus. When time-locked to trial events, averaged electroencephalography activity is referred to as event-related potentials (ERPs). Two ERP components are the P1 and P3 waveforms. The P1 waveform, which is typically measured 70-170 seconds post-stimulus onset, is associated with preconscious processes, whereas the later P3 waveform (300-600 ms) is associated with processes that occur with effortful control (Luck, 2014; Krolak-Salmon et al., 2001; Polich, 1996; Vogel, Luck, & Shapiro, 1998). Running Head: SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PERCEPTION !4 Lithari et al. (2010) found that unpleasant and high arousing stimuli evoke greater ERP amplitudes in women relative to men. However, this study is limited in several ways. First, it reports peak ERP effects, rather than the standard area-under-the-curve approach recommended by professionals in the ERP field (Luck, 2005; Woodman, 2010). Second, this study does not test for specific emotions to represent emotional valence (for example, angry, happy, and neutral), which is inconsistent with much of the present research. Instead, the visual stimuli of this paradigm consisted of images selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) collection based on their emotional content, defined in terms of their ratings of pleasure and arousal (pleasant and high arousing, pleasant and low-arousing, unpleasant and high-arousing, and unpleasant and low-arousing). Third, this study may lack a clean ERP due to the low number of stimuli per cell (they used 40 stimuli per cell). In the proposed study, I predict that men and women will respond differently to stimuli that illicit an emotional valence. Specifically, I hypothesize that the presentation of emotionally expressive faces would be more salient for women than for men, which may be due to the fact that women have a heightened threat perception system relative to men. If this is true, we will observe relatively larger P1 and P3 amplitudes for angry vs. happy or neutral faces in women relative to men. In addition, men, in general, will show lower-amplitude ERP responses than women. This information will allow us to further understand how humans experience and respond to emotional experiences in the world. It may also have implications on our understanding of certain pathologies related to emotion perception. Running Head: SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PERCEPTION !5 Methodology I will use the methodology described by Houston et al. (2018a) as the basis for my research. However, rather than testing younger and older adults, I will be looking at men and women. In addition, I will be using the Grael V2 amplifier instead of the amplifier used by Houston et al. (2018a; 2018b). Participants: I recruited 16 men and 17 women from the University of Akron. All participants had normal corrected vision. Examination of participant fatigue over the 70 minute experiment was explored in the behavioral and EEG data in order to monitor effects of fatigue (ex: more frequent eye blinks). Apparatus, stimuli, and procedure: For the emotion perception task, stimuli were presented centrally on a 23-inch Dell LCD monitor appending approximately 9.53Â° (height) by 6.75Â° (width). Each trial consisted of a single stimulus presentation consisting of a color image of a face presented against a black background. Thirty images, taken from the NimStim database (Tottenham et al., 2009), were used that comprise three emotional expressions (happy, angry, and neutral) from 10 different actors (5 male, 5 female). The actors in these images are a mixture of African-, Asian-, European-, and Latino-American descent. The emotional expressions in the NimStim database are standardized so that angry and happy faces are extreme versions of these emotional expressions. Each face was presented 40 times, including 36 practice trials. Each trial started with the presentation of a white fixation cross on a black background that persisted for 800 ms. After a 100, 300, or 900 ms onset delay, randomized within blocks, the stimuli appeared and remained until a response was collected. Participants will be asked to determine the emotional expression of the target face by pressing the keys â€œVâ€, â€œBâ€, and â€œNâ€ for angry, happy, Running Head: SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PERCEPTION !6 and neutral emotions, respectively, as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants performed one practice block of 36 trials, followed by 16 experimental blocks of 72 trials each for a total of 1,152 experimental trials. Mean reaction time and accuracy feedback were provided after each block, and participants were encouraged to take breaks after completing individual blocks. EEG recording and analyses: Electrophysiological data was recorded using a 32 channel Neuroscan EEG using Quik-caps with silver chloride (AgCl) electrodes in reference to the average of the left and right mastoid. In order to control for ocular artifacts, a horizontal electrooculogram (HEOG) was recorded from the outer canthi of both eyes and a vertical electrooculogram (VEOG) was recorded above and below the midpoint of the left eye. Impedance was kept below 5kÎ©. The EEG, HEOG, and VEOG were amplified using a Grael V2 amplifier and digitized at 500 Hz. All waveforms were analyzed using the ERPLab 6 and EEGLab 13 toolboxes in Matlab 2016b (Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004; Lopez-Calderon & Luck, 2014; Mathworks, Natick, MA). A half-amplitude high pass filter of 0.1 Hz with a 12 decibel/octave roll-off was applied to the data prior to artifact detection. Independent components were calculated from the continuous data using the runica algorithm in EEGLab. Highly probable artifact components in the continuous data files were identified and rejected based upon spatial and spectral waveform characteristics with the assistance of the MARA toolbox plugin (Winkler, Haufe, & Tangermann, 2011). Subsequent to the component rejection, 3000 ms epochs were established and time-locked to 1000 ms pre-stimulus onset. A 200 ms prestimulus onset was used as a baseline for artifact rejections in EEGLab. The P1 and P3 ERP components were computed utilizing the ERPLab toolbox. For the analysis, the P1 waveform was operationalized as the average positive amplitude in microvolts (Î¼V) at Oz and Pz in the Running Head: SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PERCEPTION !7 window of 100-200 ms after stimulus onset relative to the 200 ms pre-stimulus to stimulus onset baseline. The 100-200 ms window was selected to best account for younger and older adult P1 waveform characteristics due to the older adultsâ€™ later P1 latencies. The P3 ERP measurement was established by taking the average positive amplitude (Î¼V) at Cz and Pz in the window of 300 to 600 ms after the stimulus onset relative to the -200 ms to stimulus onset baseline. Running Head: SEX-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN EMOTION PERCEPTION !8 Results Prior to engaging in the emotion perception task, participants completed a measure of processing speed, the digit symbol coding task. There were no gender differences in the digit symbol coding task, t(31) = 0.358, p = 0.723. Behavioral analysis for the emotion perception task were conducted using a two factor ANOVA in which gender (female vs. male) was treated as a between-groups factor and emotional expression (angry vs. happy vs. neutral) served as a within-subjects factor. When relevant, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were utilized for breaks in compound symmetry and false discovery rate corrections were utilized for all simple effects as described by Benjamin & Yekutieli (2001).

We used extensive, empirically-driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inflated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests, and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inflated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency <10% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with â‰¥80% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies >25%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called â€œWinnerâ€™s Curseâ€, was common in low and moderate power settings.

We quantitatively analyzed pertinent network attributes of the entire network and each node. Further to this, hierarchical analyses were performed; group comparisons were conducted at the structure level first and then the sub-region level. The bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, as well as the thalamus were all divided into multiple functionally distinct sub-regions. From the structure level analysis, we found significant HC-vs-AD group differences in the average local efficiency and average global efficiency. In addition, the local nodal efficiencies between the right thalamus and all three of the right hippocampus, right amygdala, and left thalamus, as well as that between the left amygdala and left hippocampus, decreased significantly in AD. According to the sub-regional network analyses, we observed significant AD-induced local efficiency decreases between different sub-regions within the right hippocampus itself and between the subiculum of the right hippocampus and the sub-region of the right thalamus connecting to the temporal lobe, indicating a degradation of circuit between the hippocampus, thalamus, and temporal lobe. Statistical comparisons were performed using 40,000 non-parametric permutation tests, with false discovery rate correction employed for multiple comparison correction.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jingyuan Li"", ids = ""47787030""); list(name = ""Yujing Gong"", ids = ""47601021""); list(name = ""Xiaoying Tang"", ids = ""144649169"")",,,Neuroscience,366,70-83

Here, we compare the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from advanced stage ovarian cancer patients and healthy donors in a proof-of-concept study to identify ovarian cancer-specific biomarkers. PBMCs were collected from patients undergoing surgery with the gynecologic oncology service. RNA was extracted from the PBMCs of five patients (training set) with confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer and 4 health donor blood samples. Microarray analysis using Illumina platform was conducted and analyzed using the R statistical package. After data normalization, differentially expressed genes in the two cohorts were identified controlling for false discovery rate at 5 and 10%. The top ten up- and downregulated genes were selected. Gene ontology and pathway analysis led to identification of a Candidate Biomarker Panel (CBP) comprising of five of the ten genes that were most likely to serve as biomarkers for ovarian cancer. Validation of the CBP was achieved using PBMCs isolated from a separate group of six patients and healthy donors (test set) was performed using qPCR and flow cytometry and in vitro culture experiments. Bioinformatics analysis identified 391 genes that were up-regulated and 599 that were down-regulated. A set of five genes with high biomarker potential and were included in the CBP. All of the CBP genes were differentially expressed by 3-5 fold (p Citation Format: Shitanshu Uppal, Arvinder Kapur, Mildred Felder, Erin Medlin, Hadi Shojaei, Jesus Gonzalez-Bosquet, Manish S.

The data of interest are multivariate timeseries measured simultaneously across brain parcels using resting-state fMRI (rfMRI). We analyze functional connectivity using two heteroscedasticity models. Our first model is low-dimensional and scales linearly in the number of brain parcels. Our second model scales quadratically. We apply both models to data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) comparing connectivity between short and conventional sleepers. We find stronger functional connectivity in short than conventional sleepers in brain areas consistent with previous findings. This might be due to subjects falling asleep in the scanner. Consequently, we recommend the inclusion of average sleep duration as a covariate to remove unwanted variation in rfMRI studies. A power analysis using the HCP data shows that a sample size of 40 detects 50% of the connectivity at a false discovery rate of 20%.

This has led to recent tremendous interest in statistical methods regarding the false discovery rate (FDR). Several authors have studied the properties involving FDR in a univariate mixture model setting. In this article, we turn the problem on its side; in this manuscript, we show that FDR is a by-product of Bayesian analysis of variable selection problem for a hierarchical linear regression model. This equivalence gives many Bayesian insights as to why FDR is a natural quantity to consider. In addition, we relate the risk properties of FDR-controlling procedures to those from variable selection procedures from a decision theoretic framework different from that considered by other authors.",2006,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Debashis Ghosh"", ids = ""145165051""); list(name = ""Wei Chen"", ids = ""47482706""); list(name = ""Trivellore E.

294599e30a5fd2a74166e7b92a26d1e668d3cfcc,The Werner syndrome RECQ helicase targets G4 DNA in human cells to modulate transcription.,"The Werner syndrome (WS) is a prototypic adult Mendelian progeroid syndrome in which signs of premature aging are associated with genomic instability and an elevated risk of cancer. The WRN RECQ helicase protein binds and unwinds G-quadruplex (G4) DNA substrates in vitro, and we identified significant enrichment in G4 sequence motifs at the transcription start site and 5' ends of first introns (false discovery rate < 0.001) of genes down-regulated in WS patient fibroblasts. This finding provides strong evidence that WRN binds G4 DNA structures at many chromosomal sites to modulate gene expression. WRN appears to bind a distinct subpopulation of G4 motifs in human cells, when compared with the related Bloom syndrome RECQ helicase protein. Functional annotation of the genes and miRNAs altered in WS provided new insight into WS disease pathogenesis. WS patient fibroblasts displayed altered expression of multiple, mechanistically distinct, senescence-associated gene expression programs, with altered expression of disease-associated miRNAs, and dysregulation of canonical pathways that regulate cell signaling, genome stability and tumorigenesis. WS fibroblasts also displayed a highly statistically significant and distinct gene expression signature, with coordinate overexpression of nearly all of the cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases and associated ARS-interacting multifunctional protein genes. The 'non-canonical' functions of many of these upregulated tRNA charging proteins may together promote WS disease pathogenesis. Our results identify the human WRN RECQ protein as a G4 helicase that modulates gene expression in G4-dependent fashion at many chromosomal sites and provide several new and unexpected mechanistic insights into WS disease pathogenesis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Weiliang Tang"", ids = ""2068476""); list(name = ""Ana I Robles"", ids = ""1885953""); list(name = ""Richard P.

6d3f5ae46d13eb8bdc151ed8d62f7ac761cd6285,357â€…Variation in hospital costs for gastroschisis closure techniques,"Purpose of study Gastroschisis (GS) is a congenital anomaly that requires an emergent surgical intervention in the newborn to reduce the viscera and repair the abdominal wall. There are currently three accepted ways to repair GS: 1) primary fascial closure; 2) primary umbilical cord closure; 3) delayed fascial closure with initial silo placement. All three techniques are considered safe with similar outcomes although cost differences have not been explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in total hospital costs between GS closure techniques. Methods used A retrospective review was performed of newborns admitted to Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital with GS from 2011 to 2017. Demographic data and factors that contributed to hospital cost of GS during the initial hospitalisation were collected. Inflation adjusted cost data were obtained through the hospitalâ€™s Clinical Standard Work GS pathway. Differences between procedure cost, hospital stay, and feeding endpoints were analysed using multivariable linear regression adjusting for prematurity, complicated GS, and performance of other operations unrelated to GS. P-values were adjusted using False Discovery Rate across models for each variable. Summary of results 88 patients with GS were identified during the study period. 14%, 65%, and 21% underwent primary fascial, primary umbilical cord closure, and delayed closure, respectively. Delayed closure increased total hospital costs by 57% compared to primary closure using the fascial or umbilical cord techniques (p<0.001). Delayed closure was also associated with increases in total length of stay (p<0.05), NICU stay (p<0.001), parenteral nutrition duration (p<0.05), ventilator days (p<0.001), time to goal enteral feeds (p<0.05), and all inpatient cost categories except standard medical room cost (p<0.001). Total hospital costs were increased by 47% in infants who required operations in addition to GS closure (p<0.001). Conclusions Delayed closure for GS and the need for additional operations were associated with significant increases in total hospital cost during the index admission. As GS is a costly and resource-intensive congenital defect, identifying the most cost-effective technique to repair GS may reduce excess spending in childrenâ€™s hospitals.",2018,,"list(name = ""Myo Wong"", ids = ""65763737""); list(name = ""A.

Blood pressure (BP) response to cold pressor test (CPT) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We performed a genome-wide linkage scan and regional association analysis to identify genetic determinants of BP response to CPT.


METHODS AND RESULTS
A total of 1961 Chinese participants completed the CPT. Multipoint quantitative trait linkage analysis was performed, followed by single-marker and gene-based analyses of variants in promising linkage regions (logarithm of odds â‰¥2). A suggestive linkage signal was identified for systolic BP response to CPT at 20p13 to 20p12.3, with a maximum multipoint logarithm of odds score of 2.37. On the basis of regional association analysis with 1351 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the linkage region, we found that marker rs2326373 at 20p13 was significantly associated with mean arterial pressure responses to CPT (P=8.8Ã—10(-6)) after false discovery rate adjustment for multiple comparisons. A similar trend was also observed for systolic BP response (P=0.03) and diastolic BP response (P=4.6Ã—10(-5)). Results of gene-based analyses showed that variants in genes MCM8 and SLC23A2 were associated with systolic BP response to CPT (P=4.0Ã—10(-5) and 2.7Ã—10(-4), respectively), and variants in genes MCM8 and STK35 were associated with mean arterial pressure response to CPT (P=1.5Ã—10(-5) and 5.0Ã—10(-5), respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Within a suggestive linkage region on chromosome 20, we identified a novel variant associated with BP responses to CPT. We also found gene-based associations of MCM8, SLC23A2, and STK35 in this region. Additional work is warranted to confirm these findings.

bcadf31634a705c3d8687203ea37f54b045826ad,Effect of Prolonged Cold Ischemia on Intragraft Gene Expression Profiles,"Background Deceased-donor (DD) kidneys are at higher risk for ischemia/reperfusion injury leading to increased inflammatory mediators and innate immune response. We aimed to investigate the effects of prolonged cold ischemia on intragraft molecular gene expression profiles of DD kidneys comparing to living-donors (LD) pre-implantation biopsies using microarrays. Methods There were 48 pre-implantation kidney biopsy samples (29 LD and 19 DD). The cold ischemia time (CIT) was < 16 hours in 10 and > 16 hours in 9 DD kidneys. The gene expression profiles were studied by Affymetrix HuGene 1.0 ST expression arrays. Results There were 198 differentially expressed genes when pre-implantation DD biopsies were compared to LD biopsies (Both False discovery rate p<0.05 and fold change >2). Pathogenesis based transcripts (PBT) showed increased transcripts associated with injury and response (IRIT), Constitutive Macrophage (CMAT), and Gamma Interferon (GRIT) in DD samples compared to pre-implantation LD biopsies. There was no difference in Cytotoxic T-cell (CAT), Natural-Killer cell (NKAT), B-cell (BAT), and Endothelial cell (ENDAT) associated gene transcripts between 2 groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference in expression of any PBTs studied when biopsies with CIT > 16 hours compared to biopsies with CIT < 16 hours. Gene Ontology analysis showed that DD preimplantation biopsies had increased expression of pathways related to acute inflammatory response, lymphocyte mediated immunity, innate and humoral immune response, complement activation and regulation of immune response and IL-6 activation. Conclusions Pre-implantation DD kidney biopsies showed increased expression of gene transcripts associated with inflammatory mediators, cytokines, macrophages, innate immune response and response to injury compared to LD kidneys. However, increased cold ischemia time does not change the intragraft gene expression profiles. Figure.

4997e515f61b7664c35b03927d2971850d3f0d83,Cerebral substrates of experimental low back pain explored by functional magnetic resonance imaging,"Abstract Introduction: Low back pain (LBP) is often reported as dull pain in the deep, musculoskeletal system around the lumbar spine. Although the chronic LBP could potentially involve the supraspinal pathology, its cerebral substrates have not been defined. We have developed a human model of LBP to identify such substrates by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and further to investigate the plastic changes that may underlie the chronic progression of LBP. Methods: Six healthy volunteers, laid in the prone position in a 3â€“Tesla MRI scanner, were stimulated with a tail of an occluded disposable 20-ml syringe, filled with 25-ml air, orthogonally placed at 5 cm lateral to the L4/5. Calibrated, manual pressure was applied on the syringe so that each subject reported pain intensity at either 3 or 5 out of 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Three blocks of 30-s pain stimulus, at either 3 or 5 of VAS, were given with 30-s intervening rest conditions, while the wholeâ€“brain gradientâ€“echo echoâ€“planar imaging, optimized for blood oxygenation levelâ€“dependent (BOLD) contrast, was performed. Functional data were aligned with each subject's 3â€“dimentional highâ€“resolution image obtained during the same session, and analyzed with general linear model using BrainVoyager QX (BrainInnovation, Maastricht, Netherlands). After being averaged across subjects, the cerebral activation map was obtained with the false discovery rate at q<0.05. Results: The average force required to induce pain at the VAS of 3 and 5 was 376 Â± 72 kPa and 538 Â± 66 kPa, respectively. Pain at the VAS of 3 and 5 commonly activated the prefrontal cortex and the supplementary motor area at nearly the same BOLD amplitude, but spared the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. Discussion: The present model of LBP induced cerebral activation in the medial nociceptive system and the motorâ€“related areas, but did not show any activation in the lateral nociceptive system. Such lack of somatotopic representation might indicate that the present model of LBP involves the deep, heterogeneous structures around the lumbar spine.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yoshitaka Kobayashi"", ids = ""6922594""); list(name = ""Jiro Kurata"", ids = ""34602455""); list(name = ""Kinshi Kato"", ids = ""48056918""); list(name = ""Satoshi Hatashita"", ids = ""34016598""); list(name = ""Satoru Kayama"", ids = ""49903846""); list(name = ""Itaru Arai"", ids = ""49447995""); list(name = ""M Kokubun"", ids = ""144462555""); list(name = ""Takashi Akaishizawa"", ids = ""4092472""); list(name = ""Yoshihiro Chiba"", ids = ""2665234""); list(name = ""Shinichi Konno"", ids = ""144106395""); list(name = ""Shinichi Kikuchi"", ids = ""31878525"")",,b385dec050302784dd36f79e97422560b91a09ab; b7e3afdbb2e656960695991b66bc64febf6aca15; 136bcfca148ff5c9e54f86ab1459d49683afcf4c; ac8877b89b659b388e4c03092c7e9f57c80dc91c; 9d8f40908ae31a1cb65d5d65fb704138c46fbdef; 36880cc27c92b7c58257573004d689e7d0bf1c02; 3a99176efa5aea25c4e4e4b253f1bccb87981f48; 4d0a3f199a1331cf5b345e5b974c2694e5547f69; 9f1403975e95071552c65816e7faa573a320ba77; 84412b33de183896963f25c6357021a9eb643cb9,Pain Research,23,123-130

To investigate the association between germline variations in interleukin (IL) genes and lung cancer outcomes, we genotyped 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 33 different IL genes in 651 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Analyses were performed to investigate overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence. Our analyses revealed 24 different IL SNPs significantly associated with one or more of the lung cancer outcomes of interest. The GG genotype of IL16:rs7170924 was significantly associated with disease-free survival (HRâ€‰=â€‰0.65; 95% CI 0.50-0.83) and was the only SNP that produced a false discovery rate (FDR) of modest confidence that the association is unlikely to represent a false-positive result (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.142). Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were used to identify potential higher-order interactions. We restricted the CART analyses to the five SNPs that were significantly associated with multiple endpoints (IL1A:rs1800587, IL1B:rs1143634, IL8:s12506479, IL12A:rs662959, and IL13:rs1881457) and IL16:rs7170924 which had the lowest FDR. CART analyses did not yield a tree structure for overall survival; separate CART tree structures were identified for recurrence, based on three SNPs (IL13:rs1881457, IL1B:rs1143634, and IL12A:rs662959), and for disease-free survival, based on two SNPs (IL12A:rs662959 and IL16:rs7170924), which may suggest that these candidate IL SNPs have a specific impact on lung cancer progression and recurrence.

We investigated independent and joint associations of variations in cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), interleukin-8 (IL8), peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-alpha (PPARA), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) genes with incident nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke. In a population-based case-control study, patients (848 with MI and 368 with ischemic stroke) and controls (2,682) were recruited from postmenopausal women and hypertensive men/women who were members of Group Health in western Washington State. Common tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n=34) representing gene-wide variations were selected from gene sequencing data using pairwise linkage disequilibrium. Haplotypes were inferred using a modified expectation maximization algorithm. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated individual haplotype and SNP-disease associations in log-additive models. Global haplotype tests assessed overall gene-disease associations. Logic regression was used to evaluate gene-gene interactions. False discovery rates and permutation tests were used for multiple testing adjustment in evaluating independent associations and interactions, respectively. Overall, gene-wide variations in PPARA and TLR4 genes were associated with MI. The minor allele of the PPARA SNP, rs4253623, was associated with a higher risk of MI (odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.46), whereas the minor allele of the TLR4 SNP, rs1927911, was associated with a lower risk of MI (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.99). No within-gene or gene-gene interaction was associated with MI or ischemic stroke risk.

eaa61894b372609ef1eb6421d75ac2befb9b88e2,Ultramarathon Plasma Metabolomics: Phosphatidylcholine Levels Associated with Running Performance.,"The purpose of this study was to identify plasma metabolites associated with superior endurance running performance. In 2016, participants at the Western States Endurance Run (WSER), a 100-mile (161-km) foot race, underwent non-targeted metabolomic testing of their post-race plasma. Metabolites associated with faster finish times were identified. Based on these results, runners at the 2017 WSER underwent targeted metabolomics testing, including lipidomics and choline levels. The 2017 participants' plasma metabolites were correlated with finish times and compared with non-athletic controls. In 2016, 427 known molecules were detected using non-targeted metabolomics. Four compounds, all phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were associated with finish time (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05). All were higher in faster finishers. In 2017, using targeted PC analysis, multiple PCs, measured pre- and post-race, were higher in faster finishers (FDR < 0.05). The majority of PCs was noted to be higher in runners (both pre- and post-race) than in controls (FDR < 0.05). Runners had higher choline levels pre-race compared to controls (p < 0.0001), but choline level did not differ significantly from controls post-race (p = 0.129). Choline levels decreased between the start and the finish of the race (p < 0.0001). Faster finishers had lower choline levels than slower finishers at the race finish (p = 0.028).",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tracy B HÃ¸eg"", ids = ""1434977019""); list(name = ""Kenneth J Chmiel"", ids = ""14344375""); list(name = ""Alexandra E Warrick"", ids = ""117640975""); list(name = ""Sandra L.

b9d0dfb46011a8c2cc7b4dae626a89091dcb222d,Alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid differentially regulate the skeletal muscle secretome of obese Zucker rats.,"Evidence shows that proteins secreted from skeletal muscle influence a broad range of metabolic signaling pathways. We previously reported that essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) improved whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats; however, the mechanisms underlying these benefits remain enigmatic. While PUFA and obesity influence skeletal muscle function, their effects on the secretome are unknown. The aim of this work was to determine if improvements in whole-body glucose homeostasis in obese Zucker rats fed diets supplemented with either linoleic acid (LA) or alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) for 12 wk are related to changes in the skeletal muscle secretome. Secreted proteins were identified with a predictive bioinformatic analysis of microarray gene expression from red tibialis anterior skeletal muscle. Approximately 130 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰0.05) in obese rats compared with lean controls. The expression of 15 genes encoding secreted proteins was differentially regulated in obese controls, obese LA-supplemented, and obese ALA-supplemented rats compared with lean controls. Five secreted proteins ( Col3a1, Col15a1, Pdgfd, Lyz2, and Angptl4) were differentially regulated by LA and ALA. Most notably, ALA supplementation reduced Angptl4 gene expression compared with obese control and obese-LA supplemented rats and reduced circulating ANGPTL4 serum concentrations. ALA also influenced Angptl4 gene expression and ANGPTL4 secretion from differentiated rat L6 myotubes. Altogether, the present data indicate that obesity has a greater global impact on skeletal muscle gene expression than either essential PUFA; however, LA and ALA may exert their metabolic benefits in part by regulating the skeletal muscle secretome.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alex Rajna"", ids = ""48400560""); list(name = ""Heather Gibling"", ids = ""41033638""); list(name = ""Ousseynou Sarr"", ids = ""36736631""); list(name = ""Sarthak Matravadia"", ids = ""6940791""); list(name = ""Graham P Holloway"", ids = ""4002860""); list(name = ""David M.

804df04550809439843dceea8d39cde9e87c6a73,"Multidrug-Related Protein 1 (MRP1) Polymorphisms rs129081, rs212090, and rs212091 Predict Survival In Acute Myeloid Leukemia","Background ABCB1 (=MDR1, multidrug resistance protein 1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to have a significant impact on therapy outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, an independent significant impact on treatment response and patient survival of SNPs in the genes for ABCC4 (MRP4), ABCC5 (MRP5) and ABCC11 (MRP8) related SNPs has also been demonstrated. In contrast, therapeutic strategies trying to modulate the anthracycline efflux of these transporters have failed in most clinical trials so far. Recently, higher dosages of daunorubicin used during induction chemotherapy have been associated with a better outcome in certain subgroups of AML patients. Hence, in times of individual diagnostic genetic analyses available as point-of-care diagnostics, the goal of this study was to further investigate whether SNPs in ABC-transporter genes, which are responsible for anthracycline efflux, have an independent impact on treatment outcome.

Patients and Methods DNA samples were obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 160 Caucasian patients with newly diagnosed AML as part of the prospective AML2003 trial ([NCT00180102][1]). The cohort solely consisted of patients with a normal karyotype, based on conventional G-banding, minimizing false results in case of gain or loss of chromosomal material. All patients received double induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine. After DNA extraction, quantitative real time PCR was performed, using a total of 49 SNP assays investigating SNPs of seven different ABC genes. The identification of the corresponding SNPs was performed in an in silico analysis using the NIH dbSNP database and HapMap while statistical univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS.

Results We detected three ABCC1 (MRP1) SNPs: rs129081 (CACCCC[C/G]ACTCCA), rs212090 (TTACTG[A/T]TCCCAC), and rs212091 (ACCTTA[A/G]AGAACA) with a significant influence on disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), respectively. Patients carrying the homozygous rs129081 GG-SNP had a significant longer 5-year OS and 5-year DFS compared to the homozygous wildtype CC and heterozygous CG patients (OS: 68% [GG] vs. 40% [CC] vs. 64%, [CG], p=.035; DFS: 64% vs. 35% vs. 50%, p=.01). SNP rs212090 revealed a statistically significant difference in DFS when comparing homozygous alleles TT and AA (wildtype), 40% vs. 68%, p=.021. SNP rs212091 showed a significant difference concerning OS, with homozygous SNP GG leading to worse OS (0% vs. wildtype AA 64% vs. heterozygous AG 59%, p=.006). Again, there was a significant difference in DFS between both homozygous alleles AA (wildtype) and GG (55% vs. 0%, p=.018). Furthermore, there were no significant differences of standard clinical and laboratory baseline characteristics, FLT3 -ITD mutation, or NPM1 -mutation status, or chemotherapeutic toxicities. In order to exclude false positive findings of SNPs conferred as a result of leukemic transformation, we obtained saliva germline DNA from patients in complete remission who were treated by chemoconsolidation and performed a confirmatory analysis with the investigated SNPs, including rs129081, rs212090, and rs212091. Here, all SNPs were shown to be expressed in germline DNA in remission and bone marrow samples at diagnosis alike. The multivariate models for rs129081, rs212090 (TT), rs212091(AG), and rs212091(AA) revealed significances of p=.024, p=.029, p=.042, and p=.017 respectively for DFS but not for OS (except for rs212091[AA]). After adjustment for a false discovery rate of 5% still a trend towards the association of the SNPs and DFS could be seen. Therefore, more research is necessary to strengthen this evidence.

Conclusion In this study we found a significant influence of rs129081, rs212090, and rs212091 SNPs (ABCC1, MRP1) on survival in AML in univariate analyses. Interestingly, these polymorphisms were not associated with other AML specific characteristics at diagnosis and were shown to be expressed in germline DNA and AML DNA alike. Hence, we suggest a prognostic effect of these SNPs which might be responsible for differential anthracycline susceptibility.

In the last few years, a number of new peptide identification programs have been described, but scores or other significance measures reported by these programs cannot always be directly translated into an easy to interpret error rate measurement such as the false discovery rate. In this work we used generalized lambda distributions to model frequency distributions of database search scores computed by MASCOT, X!TANDEM with k-score plug-in, OMSSA, and InsPecT. From these distributions, we could successfully estimate p values and false discovery rates with high accuracy.

Abnormal cerebral perfusion patterns have also been reported in PD patients using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. In this study we aimed to perform a combined DTI and ASL assessment in PD patients within the basal ganglia, in order to test the relationship between microstructural and perfusion alterations. Fifty-two subjects participated in this study. Specifically, 26 PD patients [mean age (SD) = 66.7 (8.9) years, 21 males, median (IQR) Modified Hoehn and Yahr = 1.5 (1-1.6)] and twenty-six healthy controls [HC, mean age (SD) = 65.2 (7.5), 15 males] were scanned with 1.5T MRI. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) maps were derived from diffusion-weighted images, while cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were computed from ASL data. After registration to Montreal Neurological Institute standard space, FA, MD, AD, RD and CBF median values were extracted within specific regions of interest: substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. DTI measures and CBF were compared between the two groups. The relationship between diffusion parameters and CBF was tested with Spearman's correlations. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant, while uncorrected p-values <0.05 were considered a trend. No significant FA, MD and RD differences were observed. AD was significantly increased in PD patients compared with HC in the putamen (p = 0.005, pFDR = 0.035). No significant CBF differences were found between PD patients and HC. Diffusion parameters were not significantly correlated with CBF in the HC group, while a significant correlation emerged for PD patients in the caudate nucleus, for all DTI measures (with FA: r = 0.543, pFDR = 0.028; with MD: r = -0.661, pFDR = 0.002; with AD: r = -0.628, pFDR = 0.007; with RD: r = -0.635, pFDR = 0.003). This study showed that DTI is a more sensitive technique than ASL to detect alterations in the basal ganglia in the early phase of PD. Our results suggest that, although DTI and ASL convey different information, a relationship between microstructural integrity and perfusion changes in the caudate may be present.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Laura Pelizzari"", ids = ""4859604""); list(name = ""Maria Marcella LaganÃ "", ids = ""1968557""); list(name = ""Sonia Di Tella"", ids = ""13612184""); list(name = ""Federica Rossetto"", ids = ""40198486""); list(name = ""Niels P Bergsland"", ids = ""2599672""); list(name = ""Raffaello Nemni"", ids = ""119295329""); list(name = ""Mario Clerici"", ids = ""145029087""); list(name = ""Francesca Baglio"", ids = ""3090270"")",7a2ab10bf11849e920c61ac8dcf51a6f850d26e9,1a89721cbeed6cd8564520147fd2795be5c3190d; dfe74a19b7e30d56d54af08d0a4ba0343d17c868; a73024d68f8c38d65edb11fa4ee31b99cd471876; b8a690c7b3ff9c77cd966c45aef3c5fa5d4eeafd; 602b531a61237986e09e3308d65934918f387abf; c83cb156e8812906bf79337032e076f734eb5d80; e57a53734509712b6f56931dedcbf82f0df33c72; e6f1a8861391a78c953f11dbe0304027cb1cf72b; 2fb859224c0275bea16c8d07956ed24110618663; 4be7f3e8f8142247599eba69bacd9630bcb66a88; 434494a44e66dd459cfcaf1bf0fe0ac522d4a86f; 51aaf12ddb45a154e5edbdfb47eadf59f59d0179; 729af94d94d771fd456f1532be7e1081c646590d; f0c6dac575673fe01f23ea922caba6bc17c3565a; d5fa1ff2fd359c6842dcefaa42211a052052ab9b; 2a84453518d7bfe8ec45d8995efbcef8fc2fa60d; 8744b6ce4bdd9c364acd5bd51c62621dfeed23b9; b815f9c5f7698087eecd56ead307144e9949b0db; 54e43726fdaeb8b30c0b8052b099cf5c532ccfcc; d295252063c96ecad04165a7471700a5fc55cf3f; f94072489128d1d00154b37205095c5de9e0339d; bdda7edc2306c571f22dbc0bbee8ddf2364ddcab; 1c18006bb32eeab260e460031afbbde0c8d25ed2; 75fa05fa1a2f175ac13abed5683e4dd88fb3030e; 880ff9a2d1b63cc77e6fcf02a68a38ab8439bcc3; dc4b417dcdb3e73da73c4841b39a8546cbe96fff; e2f6f8477b4ceb0852c8afa6da4e51f4c2d4ec18; 7e28671772fec3ee379d14e940b997fc085c7026; fedb195862aac534e1eee5b28e3383052d2d45d1; 8ef1095dd871bfff2fda61cfd62c15513d90839f; 557934d0e68f66f0770409f997a356d6dbad4848; f2b643196d6b6add22d217927ba617795400a2c2; 4e5684b1ab78ff5fc1645395c26ce1d46151889f; 1a1f0c28f684fdf078d12efdd6420285ea256be8; a535099649d3b1585c5c56c39f0a2d5e51509dfe; 4e9f53288c6da8ea3e7b68e1b78b898647729e0b; 213e55ce8897997833ab16ea1f6539a617dbb453; b24948462073674cc091b59731ce2d994f514344; faf1bddae3f18d06c32382668c6076b3fb6e9097; 56559b8133bc37116f4abafe90793566c544ab6f; 95d793cce4c9e9193ef220d942f3a5793a47e9c7; 02d5c055dfd0debbec9cba6857b732e240523ad7; 7a3a7e291b445f2394ee7520cb3640e128b2c979; 20ef6d5cf9f703c9e2e291123259f824f72085b9; 094a35b3f915c57e1daf58dcad07866cedcd4537; 91d54c36c70a04b66968bc634f338e39438cb0ff; c9245b607b22a88becc35107b243611c36b5fe72; 8f8b7314fedc501c5ab5b38bcc44997873849fa9; 0dc5ebc5f9e06d34f11f833eee12053940ef8161; 0fea27158a917fb6c11d104ebee816ed2652cae4; 50b9376305696a428422f88d7d9a4dde19c31291; 6e59f72df690361a0018cf4768bb915140e89a0f; 1b76e4fd6e09a4ce8f5d26c8dc6c3cf5e79f31ca; 274f4b17097bb1864322c911cfd685866e44ab71; c2d9bad5c81f1f5634cc7e8dbadea318a8630784; 255fe44e737a0bf3229eb28f9840a34f27720687; 5da4ba2605e2a94ad0716ef181595e80fb935fb5; 3f9dd39d2072ba3127b05fd45ce8ae8ca15f8acc; c2eceea03075c380b513e12262b58549a567d4ab; 4963e83f23d5e286e69f5987fa1cbfe4725f9d2d; a9757faf97ec9893d68f803ceb25086842497522; 49882790a70418739c356f52b125a21dba8f60fb; d67102e4337c18bf2f9c5f124198fdbaad61e9f7; 1fe3ac85e066dd77d65697ec2883265b4282657c,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,11,
a5d4d60b5c48b54fa291bab380388e0bdfcfed59,Effect modification of endocrine disruptors and testicular germ cell tumour risk by hormone-metabolizing genes.,"It has been hypothesized that the increased prevalence of testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) may be attributable to endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs); these may be modulated by hormone-metabolizing enzymes. Using data from 568 cases and 698 controls enrolled in the US Servicemen's Testicular Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study, we examined associations between TGCT and POPs, including p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, chlordane-related compounds and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), modified by polymorphisms in five hormone-metabolizing genes (CYP17A1, CYP1A1, HSD17B1, HSD17B4 and AR). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models that stratified associations of POP exposure and TGCT risk by genotype. Two polymorphisms in CYP1A1, rs1456432 and rs7495708, modified the association between trans-nonachlor and total chlordanes and TGCT risk. Among men with a minor allele for rs1456432, those with the highest quartiles had an increased risk of TGCT (OR = 1.90, 95% CI, 1.01-3.56) compared with those with the lowest; there was no increased risk among men with the homozygous major allele genotype (p-interactions = 0.024). Similar results were seen for rs7495708. HSD17B4 rs384346 modified the associations between TGCT risk and PCB-118 and PCB-138 concentrations: the 45-55% reductions in TGCT risk for men with the highest quartiles compared with the lowest quartiles were only present in those who had a major homozygous allele genotype (p-interactions < 0.04). Thus, there are suggestions that certain CYP1A1 and HSD17B4 polymorphisms may modify the associations between POPs and TGCT risk. With false discovery rate values >0.2, however, caution is advisable when interpreting the findings of this study.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Victoria M.

Coffee is the most commonly consumed beverage in the world after water, however the debate as to whether coffee consumption is beneficial or detrimental to health continues. Current evidence of the link between coffee and health outcomes is predominately observational, thus subject to methodological issues such a confounding and reverse causation.


METHODS
This Mendelian randomisation phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) used information from up to 333,214 participants of White-British ancestry in the UK Biobank to examine the causal association between genetically instrumented habitual coffee consumption and the full range of disease outcomes. We constructed a genetic risk score for habitual coffee consumption and screened for associations with disease outcomes across 1117 case-control series. All signals under false discovery rate controlled threshold (5.8Â Ã—Â 10-4) were followed by Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses, with replication in independent data sources where possible.


RESULTS
The initial phenome-wide association analysis identified signals for 13 outcomes representing five distinct diseases. The strongest signal was seen for gout (PÂ =Â 2.3Â Ã—Â 10-12), but there was notable pleiotropy (Pdistortion <0.001) and MR analyses did not support an association with habitual coffee consumption (inverse variance weighted MR OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.25, PÂ =Â 0.31). Support for a possible causal relationship between habitual coffee consumption was only obtained for four distinct disease outcomes, including an increased odds of osteoarthrosis (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.35), other arthropathies (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.33) and overweight (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.56), and a lower odds of postmenopausal bleeding (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82). Evidence for an association between habitual coffee consumption and these four diseases was also supported by phenotypic associations with self-reported coffee consumption.


CONCLUSIONS
This large-scale MR-PheWAS provided little evidence for notable harm or benefit with respect to higher habitual coffee consumption. The only evidence for harm was seen with respect to osteoarthrosis, other arthropathies and obesity.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Konstance Nicolopoulos"", ids = ""1631744669""); list(name = ""Anwar Mulugeta"", ids = ""1391052826""); list(name = ""Ang Zhou"", ids = ""40502936""); list(name = ""Elina HyppÃ¶nen"", ids = ""89860398"")",,,Clinical nutrition,,
3953b57824537252f559f4f2bca563cb1623b74d,17q12-21 and asthma: interactions with early-life environmental exposures.,"BACKGROUND
17q12-21 polymorphisms are associated with asthma presence and severity across different populations.


OBJECTIVE
To extensively investigate the genes in this region among Croatian schoolchildren in a case-control study, taking account of early-life environmental exposures.


METHODS
We included 423 children with asthma and 414 controls aged 5 to 18 years. Fifty-one haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped (GSDMA, GSDMB, ORMDL3, IKZF3, ZPBP2, and TOP2). Data on exposure to smoking and furry pet ownership were collected using a validated questionnaire. Information on severe asthma exacerbations with hospital admission were retrieved from hospital notes. All patients underwent spirometry.


RESULTS
We found 2 SNPs (1 novel rs9635726 in IKZF3) to be associated with asthma. Among children with asthma, 4 SNPs (in ZPBP2, GSDMB, and GSDMA) were associated with hospital admissions and 8 SNPs with lung function. One SNP (rs9635726) remained significantly associated with a predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second after false discovery rate correction. Nine markers across 5 genes showed interaction with early-life environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in relation to asthma and 2 with furry pet ownership. Among children with asthma, we observed significant interactions between early-life ETS exposure and 3 SNPs for lung function and among early-life ETS exposure, 3 SNPs (in ORMDL3 and GSDMA), and hospital admission with asthma exacerbation. Three SNPs (in ORMDL3) interacted with current furry pet ownership in relation to hospital admissions for asthma exacerbation.


CONCLUSION
Our results indicate that several genes in the 17q12-21 region may be associated with asthma.

To fully utilize the information obtained from these three measurement dimensions, informatics tools based on the accurate mass and time tag methodology were modified to incorporate ion mobility spectrometry drift times for peptides observed in human serum. In this work a reference human serum database was created for 12,139 peptides and populated with the monoisotopic mass, liquid chromatography normalized elution time, and ion mobility spectrometry drift time(s) for each.

f7d2fc33317956448386b1dd71f5125ea29a7e7e,Advances in genome-wide RNAi cellular screens: a case study using the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway,"BackgroundGenome-scale RNA-interference (RNAi) screens are becoming ever more common gene discovery tools. However, whilst every screen identifies interacting genes, less attention has been given to how factors such as library design and post-screening bioinformatics may be effecting the data generated.ResultsHere we present a new genome-wide RNAi screen of the Drosophila JAK/STAT signalling pathway undertaken in the Sheffield RNAi Screening Facility (SRSF). This screen was carried out using a second-generation, computationally optimised dsRNA library and analysed using current methods and bioinformatic tools. To examine advances in RNAi screening technology, we compare this screen to a biologically very similar screen undertaken in 2005 with a first-generation library. Both screens used the same cell line, reporters and experimental design, with the SRSF screen identifying 42 putative regulators of JAK/STAT signalling, 22 of which verified in a secondary screen and 16 verified with an independent probe design. Following reanalysis of the original screen data, comparisons of the two gene lists allows us to make estimates of false discovery rates in the SRSF data and to conduct an assessment of off-target effects (OTEs) associated with both libraries. We discuss the differences and similarities between the resulting data sets and examine the relative improvements in gene discovery protocols.ConclusionsOur work represents one of the first direct comparisons between first- and second-generation libraries and shows that modern library designs together with methodological advances have had a significant influence on genome-scale RNAi screens.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Katherine H Fisher"", ids = ""4719831""); list(name = ""Victoria M Wright"", ids = ""39264245""); list(name = ""Amy Murrell Taylor"", ids = ""46386474""); list(name = ""Martin P Zeidler"", ids = ""20735190""); list(name = ""Stephen Brown"", ids = ""46957288"")",48206ea34ebe41dcd28bb018d30e2a5741c81ebd; 78e401de2b4c022b8e4888668171e6e1b763c979; 9b6839fd464e6cfa70e4a098bb4b001590c02392; c03805393692a75ebeddf0bc0e064502a7210088; 403a733b462d3935ce29a1f532b1f4779e98c17a; 1e7ec4c077d4650c35d432fb27e3b594ebea9f46; 5357108acfb2e8f10448b0c5b1bc24200f9de7d2; 27bdc61d45d9263c24d530cc931216374f8dcc48; 80dab69a654592b53fb05a47afc1646b2488e9ea; fc245abec8fe241917cd1dd0379973034d56faaf; 28cd95293219b6b6a99ffa14c2a74ee72a6959d5; efe3dced180b687d5854e170fb60fd1e02773ec1,f2b1817da889d968b64280d54a5003e8b8baca2c; 2cbfddd598efe391a91ac2531278b35e551ee9ea; 72e29f7f8f7b8873c5b279d3a24cacca8007b205; 6e51352d2f1ed0126616b992ff3bd6587efaf2c3; 8fe199c5bcad662d008695c436f77277ade40a2b; 9e0f9e38b1e36eea706b7de522b8bdc3b5c3cf02; 0826ec9cf6054701527d38b9992ac4cc987aacee; 47a752555f0f23c2832b5b625eea9ee2886e62b2; fb25dd38ab4389d75b371d4cdebe1b159454ca14; bc7c8d1ef1d9265d0f91387a59f78ca6ef0d7b7f; 3f6ccd3691e1db15f7be86967db680eef02c0318; f5a72aee7854c85cc6803773501b5f5f67ed95d6; ba3473e37235104a1d055abef81bbda4766066b9; f8ed26f3fb222a8288b53fbd05670f84b3c28aaf; d23c548ad083fe3140aaaaea500a47b5438e77ff; a1c647fdc8e60ba746ececffc407df37ea74aaad; 1e319a79d6e43ebd2466fe7453efb471a0dbe152; 505ae16e5b83eefdf9f9973a73462d6b89964ca3; 58f596f31361b069e944445d5cf65e2317d85017; 33150d7d001f163a4c69c472a621fc5baa977789; af893d0ff0ebdde2e01ac5b893632070bf401ef2; a3cccc7e31be6e6c8778b0bdfa183742315d3329; e1907f47284c67aab45180bdeb3ba7208873b8ea; 07248cf033ffcbd4ea0612a4865e3a722cb20b2f; 4e8068598a6160d352fb304f0100583d88dc3bbe; 8cd567450adabac36e9fefc11a09d0d155b155ac; 409e9d1762e19199fa6ec722f58863baba917a91; abb375f48ca7cd2a2d83b41414fb27cf538cdd88; 206cfc7e55fbe97cee2cfb8f3b5a8ca979155986; 01d3155c927d48cdab1563e7eb4498414ca29220; 45b344dd2b885ed48dee95d99e6b4bc5c35eba68; 823a299aaa240625760a3d0b88214383446eacbb,BMC Genomics,13,506 - 506

To assess whether PAH exposure is associated with declined sperm function. Ten monohydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) metabolites were analyzed in repeated urine samples from an infertility clinic. We used multivariable linear models to estimate the associations of urinary OH-PAH metabolites with sperm DNA damage (n=405) and spermatozoa apoptosis (n=366). The shapes of dose-dependent associations of exposure measurements with outcomes were further evaluated by restricted cubic splines. Multiple comparisons were adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR). We found that urinary 9-hydroxyfluorene (9-OHFlu) was associated with increased tail length and comet length (p for trend=0.05 and 0.01, respectively), and that urinary 9-hydroxyphenanthrene (9-OHPh) was associated with decreased percentage of Annexin V-/PI- spermatozoa (p for trend=0.04). Also, suggestive associations of urinary 9-OHPh and âˆ‘OHFlu with increased comet length, and urinary 9-OHFlu and 2-OHPh with decreased percentage of Annexin V-/PI- spermatozoa were observed (all p for trends <0.10). Further, these dose-dependent associations were confirmed in restricted cubic splines.

8686598df42718289d6890ceb16eafc4a2fa09e5,A non-randomized procedure for large-scale heterogeneous multiple discrete testing based on randomized tests.,"In the analysis of next-generation sequencing technology, massive discrete data are generated from short read counts with varying biological coverage. Conducting conditional hypothesis testing such as Fisher's Exact Test at every genomic region of interest thus leads to a heterogeneous multiple discrete testing problem. However, most existing multiple testing procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) assume that test statistics are continuous and become conservative for discrete tests. To overcome the conservativeness, in this article, we propose a novel multiple testing procedure for better FDR control on heterogeneous discrete tests. Our procedure makes decisions based on the marginal critical function (MCF) of randomized tests, which enables achieving a powerful and non-randomized multiple testing procedure. We provide upper bounds of the positive FDR (pFDR) and the positive false non-discovery rate (pFNR) corresponding to our procedure. We also prove that the set of detections made by our method contains every detection made by a naive application of the widely-used q-value method. We further demonstrate the improvement of our method over other existing multiple testing procedures by simulations and a real example of differentially methylated region (DMR) detection using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaoyu Dai"", ids = ""49044371""); list(name = ""Nan Lin"", ids = ""144650470""); list(name = ""Daofeng Li"", ids = ""2653258""); list(name = ""Ting Wang"", ids = ""50819718"")",bd3af34c575d7859b48e728b5456110b390a95a0,,Biometrics,,
53c06e8afdbb895418cf385a020984aae9cb07d8,Complex integrated analysis of lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVES
This study aims to reveal regulatory network of lncRNAs-miRNAs-mRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) through gene expression data.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs (cut-off: False discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 and |fold change|>1.5) were unveiled by package edgeR of R. Cox regression analysis was performed to screen prognostic factors in OSCC related with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed for differentially expressed mRNAs using BioGRID, HPRD and DIP. Key hub genes were identified from top 100 differentially expressed mRNAs ranked by betweenness centrality using recursive feature elimination. LncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA regulatory network were constructed and combined into ceRNAs regulatory network. Gene ontology biological terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were identified using Fisher's exact test.


RESULTS
A total of 929 differentially expressed mRNAs, 23 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 29 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. 59 mRNAs, 6 miRNAs (hsa-mir-133a-1, hsa-mir-1-2, hsa-mir-486, hsa-mir-135b, hsa-mir-196b, hsa-mir-193b) and 6 lncRNAs (C10orf91, C2orf48, SFTA1P, FLJ41941,PART1,TTTY14) were related with OS; and 52 mRNAs, 4 miRNAs (hsa-mir-133a-1, hsa-mir-135b, hsa-mir-196b, hsa-mir-193b) and 2 lncRNAs (PART1, TTTY14) were associated with RFS. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier containing 37 key hub genes was obtained. A ceRNA regulatory network containing 417 nodes and 696 edges was constructed. ECM-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, focal adhesion, arachidonic acid metabolism, and p53 signaling pathway were significantly enriched in the network.

We investigated the associations of 9354 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 106 centrosomal genes with lung cancer risk by first using the summary data from six published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) (12,160 cases and 16 838 controls) and then conducted in silico replication in two additional independent lung cancer GWASs of Harvard University (984 cases and 970 controls) and deCODE (1319 cases and 26,380 controls). A total of 44 significant SNPs with false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.05 were mapped to one novel gene FGFR1OP and two previously reported genes (TUBB and BRCA2). After combined the results from TRICL with those from Harvard and deCODE, the most significant association (P combined = 8.032 Ã— 10(-6)) was with rs151606 within FGFR1OP.

114e92d88bd64f18f611d37dcd93e6a715633f00,Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5â€² UTR of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (PtUGDH) associate with wood properties in Populus tomentosa,"Association studies have emerged as a powerful tool for identification of markers associated with quantitative traits in forest trees. The cytosolic enzyme uridine 5â€² diphosphate-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronate and affects cell wall formation in higher plants. Here, we used association genetics to identify UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (PtUGDH) allelic variation that associates with wood quality traits in Populus tomentosa. We isolated a 1,828Â bp PtUGDH cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 481 amino acids. Expression analysis revealed that PtUGDH was expressed predominantly in young root, developing xylem from vascular tissues, and young leaves, suggesting that UGDH functions in cell wall formation. We identified 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Ï€Tâ€‰=â€‰0.00475) by resequencing the PtUGDH locus of 40 individuals and genotyped the 22 most common SNPs (minor allele frequency >10Â %) in a discovery population (nâ€‰=â€‰426). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that LD did not extend over the entire gene (r2â€‰<â€‰0.1, within 300Â bp). Association studies indicated that three SNPs (false discovery rate, Qâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and 12 haplotypes (Qâ€‰<â€‰0.05) were significantly associated with wood properties. The three significant SNPs are all in the 5â€² untranslated regions of PtUGDH, and the phenotypic variance explained by each SNP ranged from 5.37 to 11.97Â %. We validated one association in a validation population (nâ€‰=â€‰1,200) and validated another association by examining its effect on gene expression. The present study provided molecular markers associated with fiber length and holocellulose content, markers that have potential applications in marker-assisted breeding.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Jiaxing Tian"", ids = ""4058615""); list(name = ""Qingzhang Du"", ids = ""3873809""); list(name = ""Bailian LiB.

b0d6e19f7c80addd4b515ff2a6898bc04065ab3a,Abstract P6-05-02: Intrinsic subtype and gene expression changes between primary and metastatic breast cancer,"Background: A better understanding of the biological changes occurring during metastatic progression of breast cancer is needed to identify new biomarkers, targets and novel treatment strategies. Here, we compared the intrinsic subtype and the expression of a gene panel across a large dataset of paired primary and metastatic tissues. Methods: Expression profiling of 105 breast cancer-related genes was performed on 254 (127 pairs) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues using the nCounter platform. Tumor samples were obtained from 3 independent sources (ConvertHER trial [BCRT 2014] and two in-house datasets). Tumors were classified into each intrinsic subtype using the research-based PAM50 classifier (Parker et al. J Clin Oncol 2009). Chi-square tests were performed to determine the differences in the distribution of variables. Paired two-class Significance of Microarrays (SAM) was performed to determine the genes differentially expressed between paired primary and metastatic tissues. In vitro stable transfection of FGFR4-GFP was performed on Luminal B MCF7 cell line. RNA was purified on control vs. transfected cell lines. 7-AAD cell viability was performed following estrogen deprivation for 6 days. Results: Subtype distribution in primary vs. metastatic disease was 39.0% vs. 26.8% for Luminal A (p=0.012), 26.0% vs. 35.0% for Luminal B (p=0.322), 11.4% vs. 20.3% for HER2-enriched (p=0.115) and 10.6% vs. 13.0% for Basal-like tumors (p=0.843). The rate of subtype conversion was 7.7% in Basal-like, 23.1% in HER2-enriched, 30.0% in Luminal B and 54.3% in Luminal A disease. The majority of subtype conversions in Luminal A disease were to Luminal B (72.0%) and HER2-enriched (24.0%). Overall, 13.2% of primary Luminal A/B tumors progressed to a HER2-E subtype despite 70% of them being clinically HER2-negative. In a paired analysis using all samples, 10- and 12- genes were found up- and down- regulated in metastatic tissues (False Discovery Rate [FDR] Conclusions: Metastatic tissues are relatively more proliferative and less luminal compared to primary tumors. This is especially relevant in primary Luminal A disease. In contrast, metastatic tissues from Basal-like primary disease remain largely unchanged. In luminal disease, a significant increase in the HER2-enriched profile is observed in metastatic disease despite most tumors being clinically HER2-negative. A potential driver of the HER2-enriched profile and estrogen independence in clinically HER2-negative metastatic tissues might be FGFR4.

27495485bc16339e34a05a70ba279641b534aa8a,Dynamic adaptive procedures for false discovery rate estimation and control,"In the multiple testing problem with independent tests, the classical linear step-up procedure controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at level $\pi_0\alpha$, where $\pi_0$ is the proportion of true null hypotheses and $\alpha$ is the target FDR level. The adaptive procedures can improve power by incorporating estimates of $\pi_0$, which typically rely on a tuning parameter. For the fixed adaptive procedures that set their tuning parameters before seeing the data, the properties of the conservative FDR estimation and finite sample FDR control hold simultaneously. Less is known about the dynamic adaptive procedures whose tuning parameters are determined by the data. We show that, if the tuning parameter is chosen according to a left-to-right stopping time (LRS) rule from a fixed candidate set, the corresponding adaptive procedure estimates the FDR conservatively and controls the FDR as well. Furthermore, even if the tuning parameter candidates are random, such as $p$-values, we are able to prove the finite sample control of the FDR by using a series of LRS approximations. Consequently, the finite sample FDR control property is established for most existing dynamic adaptive procedures.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peter Macdonald"", ids = ""47218065""); list(name = ""Kun Liang"", ids = ""49604772"")",,,arXiv: Methodology,,

The complete proteome of the human pancreas, where both the dysfunctional beta cells and their proximal environment co-exist, remains unknown. Here, we used TMT10-based isobaric labeling and multidimensional LC-MS/MS to quantitatively profile the differences between pancreatic head region tissues from T1D (NÂ =Â 5) and healthy subjects (NÂ =Â 5). Among the 5357 (1% false discovery rate) confidently identified proteins, 145 showed statistically significant dysregulation between T1D and healthy subjects. The differentially expressed pancreatic proteome supports the growing notion of a potential role for exocrine pancreas involvement in T1D. This study also demonstrates the utility for this approach to analyze dysregulated proteins as a means to investigate islet biology, pancreatic pathology and T1D pathogenesis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chih-Wei Liu"", ids = ""47535336""); list(name = ""Mark A.

This study compared global multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-induced gene expression from human lung epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells in monoculture and coculture with gene expression from mouse lungs exposed to MWCNT. Using a cutoff of 10% false discovery rate and 1.5 fold change, we determined that there were more concordant genes (gene expression both up- or downregulated in vivo and in vitro) expressed in both cell types in coculture than in monoculture. When reduced to only those genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis, known outcomes of in vivo MWCNT exposure, there were more disease-related concordant genes expressed in coculture than monoculture. Additionally, different cellular signaling pathways are activated in response to MWCNT dependent upon culturing conditions. As coculture gene expression better correlated with in vivo gene expression, we suggest that cellular cocultures may offer enhanced in vitro models for nanoparticle risk assessment and the reduction of in vivo toxicological testing.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brandi N.

However, the neural correlates of this relationship are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in both cortical thickness and subcortical volumes between drug-naive LOD patients and healthy controls and explore the relationship between LOD and cognitive impairments. A total of 48 elderly, drug-naive patients with LOD and 47 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3T MRI scanning, and the cortical thickness was compared between the groups in multiple locations, across the continuous cortical surface. The subcortical volumes were also compared on a structure-by-structure basis. Subjects with LOD exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the superior and middle temporal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex when compared with healthy subjects (all p<0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Reduced volumes of the right hippocampus was also observed in LOD patients when compared with healthy controls (p<0.001). There were significant correlations between memory functions and cortical thickness of medial temporal, isthmus cingulate, and precuneus (p<0.001). This study was the first study to explore the relationships between the cortical thickness/subcortical volumes and cognitive impairments of drug-naive patients with LOD. These structural changes might explain the neurobiological mechanism of LOD as a risk factor of dementia.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyun Kook Lim"", ids = ""3260937""); list(name = ""Won sang Jung"", ids = ""3170703"");

Likelihood-ratio-test-based activation statistics are derived for both models and are compared in terms of activation detection and false discovery rates for simulated and experimental data. For simulated data, the complexvalued AR(p) model likelihood-ratio activation statistic show superior power of activation detection at low signal-to-noise ratios and lower false discovery rates. Also, when applied to an experimental data set, the activation map produced by the complex-valued AR(p) model more clearly identifies the primary activation regions. Our results advocate the use of the complex-valued data and the Gaussian AR(p) model as a more efficient and reliable tool in fMRI experiments over the current practice of using only the magnitude dataset.",2015,,"list(name = ""Daniel W.

Because lncRNAs have been shown to be secreted into the general circulation, they may be used as diagnostic tools for some diseases. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a disease in which women have menstrual cessation before the age of 40, accompanied by elevated follicle stimulating hormone and decreased estrogen levels. In this study, ovarian cortical tissues from five women with normal menstrual cycles and from five POI patients were used for next-generation RNA sequencing. We found 20 differentially expressed lncRNAs with 12 upregulated and eight downregulated lncRNAs in cortical tissues of POI ovaries, compared with normal controls (fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2 and false discovery rate[FDR]â€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). We also found 52 differentially expressed messenger RNA transcripts, with 33 upregulated and 19 downregulated ones (foldchangeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2 and FDRâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). Functional annotation showed that these differentially expressed transcripts were associated with follicular development and granulosa cell function. Thirteen differentially expressed lncRNAs and their targeted neighboring transcripts were coregulated in ovarian cortical tissues, including lnc-ADAMTS1-1:1/ADAMTS1, lnc-PHLDA3-3:2/CSRP1, lnc-COL1A1-5:1/COL1A1, lnc-SAMD14-5:3/COL1A1, and lnc-GULP1-2:1/COL3A1. Furthermore, serum levels of these lncRNAs in POI patients were significantly different from those in normal patients ( pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and expression differences were consistent with those in ovarian cortical tissues. This study showed that key lncRNAs were differentially expressed in both ovarian cortical tissues and serum samples between women with normal menstrual cycles and POI patients. Further studies on the regulation of ovarian lncRNAs during follicular development are critical in understanding the etiologies of POI. Analyses of lncRNA expression in serum samples might provide a basis for early diagnosis and treatment of POI.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Guidong Yao"", ids = ""2893501""); list(name = ""Jiahuan He"", ids = ""47752365""); list(name = ""Yue Kong"", ids = ""2717141""); list(name = ""Jun Zhai"", ids = ""144303948""); list(name = ""Yijiang Xu"", ids = ""96131825""); list(name = ""Guang Yang"", ids = ""143951511""); list(name = ""Deqi Kong"", ids = ""1786989""); list(name = ""Fangli Dong"", ids = ""7432375""); list(name = ""Senlin Shi"", ids = ""48806712""); list(name = ""Qingling Yang"", ids = ""47492297""); list(name = ""Ying-Pu Sun"", ids = ""66166451"")",,,Molecular reproduction and development,,

The NEB cows were feed-restricted to 60% of calculated net energy for lactation requirements for 7 days, and cows assigned to PEB were fed the same diet for ad libitum intake. Five days after feed restriction, one rear mammary quarter of each cow was inoculated with 5,000 cfu of S. uberis (O140J). At 20 h postinoculation, S. uberis-infected mammary quarters from all cows were biopsied for RNA extraction. Negative energy balance resulted in 287 differentially expressed genes (DEG; false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05), with 86 DEG upregulated and 201 DEG downregulated in NEB vs. PEB. Canonical pathways most affected by NEB were IL-8 signaling (10 genes), glucocorticoid receptor signaling (13), and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response (10). Among the genes differentially expressed by NEB, cell growth and proliferation (48) and cellular development (36) were the most enriched functions. Regarding immune response, HLA-A was upregulated due to NEB, whereas the majority of genes involved in immune response were downregulated (e.g., AKT1, IRAK1, MAPK9, and TRAF6). This study provided new avenues for investigation into the mechanisms relating NEB and susceptibility to mastitis in lactating dairy cows.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kasey M.

There is less systematic investigation of the capacity of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) as biomarkers associated with breast cancer pathogenesis or several clinicopathological variables including receptor status and patient survival. We designed a two-stage study, including 1,000 breast tumor RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as the discovery stage, and RNA-seq data of matched tumor and adjacent normal tissue from 50 breast cancer patients as well as 23 normal breast tissue from healthy women as the replication stage. We identified 83 lincRNAs showing the significant expression changes in breast tumors with a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰1% in the discovery dataset. Thirty-seven out of the 83 were validated in the replication dataset. Integrative genomic analyses suggested that the aberrant expression of these 37 lincRNAs was probably related with the expression alteration of several transcription factors (TFs). We observed a differential co-expression pattern between lincRNAs and their neighboring genes.

a9f22c86315b8543b5bc0c1649a093081a4b12bf,A dynamic wavelet-based algorithm for pre-processing tandem mass spectrometry data,"MOTIVATION
Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is one of the most commonly used research techniques for identifying and characterizing proteins in biological and medical research. The identification of a protein is the critical first step in elucidating its biological function. Successful protein identification depends on various interrelated factors, including effective analysis of MS data generated in a proteomic experiment. This analysis comprises several stages, often combined in a pipeline or workflow. The first component of the analysis is known as spectra pre-processing. In this component, the raw data generated by the mass spectrometer is processed to eliminate noise and identify the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and intensity for the peaks in the spectrum corresponding to the presence of certain peptides or peptide fragments. Since all downstream analyses depend on the pre-processed data, effective pre-processing is critical to protein identification and characterization. There is a critical need for more robust pre-processing algorithms that perform well on tandem mass spectra under a variety of different conditions and can be easily integrated into sophisticated data analysis pipelines for practical wet-lab applications.


RESULT
We have developed a new pre-processing algorithm. Based on wavelet theory, our method uses a dynamic peak model to identify peaks. It is designed to be easily integrated into a complete proteomic analysis workflow. We compared the method with other available algorithms using a reference library of raw MS and tandem MS spectra with known protein composition information. Our pre-processing algorithm results in the identification of significantly more peptides and proteins in the downstream analysis for a given false discovery rate.

61552173b28e286e7d980b7466f8dc9529ed5adc,ABCG2 Polymorphism Is Associated with Lower Major Molecular Response Rates in CML Patients Treated with 400 Mg Imatinib but Not in Patients Treated with 600 Mg Imatinib.,"Abstract 2465 Background This study was designed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with probability of achieving a major molecular response (MMR) in chronic phase CML patients (pts) treated with imatinib. We used a non-commercial, pharmacogenetics-dedicated DNA chip containing 16561 SNPs covering 1916 candidate genes. We tested an exploratory cohort of pts treated with imatinib first line or after interferon therapy and then extended our finding in a validation set of pts included in the French SPIRIT trial (C Preudhomme, NEJM 2011) and randomized to the 400 mg or the 600 mg imatinib arm. Patients and methods Constitutive DNA samples from 312 pts were analyzed: samples from 91 pts in the exploratory set and 221 pts in the validation set (SPIRIT trial: 120 pts within the 400 mg imatinib arm and 101 pts within the 600 mg imatinib arm). We analyzed the expression of BCR-ABL/ABL standardized ratio as a function of the time elapsed since imatinib initiation for each patient using nonlinear (spline) interpolation and then derived the delay to achieve MMR or time of follow-up. With this method, we obtained a cumulative incidence curve of MMR in both groups. Relevant SNPs were identified using a COX model adjusted for covariates (sex, two first principal components and Sokal score when available). SNP with FDR (False Discovery Rate) below 30% in the exploratory cohort where subsequently investigate in the SPIRIT trial groups. Results Patient characteristics such as age, sex, Sokal score were homogeneous between exploratory and validations sets as well as within both arms of the SPIRIT trial. We confirmed the prognostic value of the Sokal score in term of cumulative incidence of MMR (CI-MMR) in both sets of pts (CI-MMR was 83%, 67% and 56% for low, intermediate and hight Sokal risk groups respectively, additive log rank, p Association study shows that 10 SNPs identified pts with significantly different probability to achieve MMR within the two first year of therapy (FDR less than 30% p ABCG2 gene. In the SPIRIT trial (n=221), only two SNPs from ABCG2 locus were significantly associated with a higher probability of achieving MMR. We then analyzed separately both arms of the SPIRIT trial. All tree ABCG2-SNPs identified in the exploratory set of pts were significantly associated with CI-MMR in the 400 arm at the 5% level. In contrast, none of them were confirmed in the 600 mg arm. In order generalize our results and to get closer to the underling molecular structure of genotypes markers we performed haplotyping at locus of ABCG2 gene. Multivariate analysis distinguished two minor haplotypes (haplotype 1 and 3) linked to MMR achievement in pts receiving 400 mg/day of imatinib (from exploratory set and SPIRIT, n=211). Haplotypes 1 had G-C-G and haplotype 2 had G-T-G at rs12505410, rs13120400 and rs2725252 respectively and their frequencies were 26 and 6% respectively. Collapsing these haplotypes yielded a surrogate dominant marker highly associated to CI-MMR in this group (p Conclusion The ABCG2 gene product is a well-known protein involved in drug absorption in the bowel. Polymorphism of the ABCG2 gene has been implicated in drugs absorption including imatinib. We here confirm that ABCG2 haplotypes could distinguish patients at a lower probability to achieve MMR. We report for the first time that this unfavorable pharmacologic effect can be overcome in vivo by increasing imatinib daily dose from 400 mg to 600 mg.

c4a43ead1a6b34a4de61c65144e7df1727cfc41d,Best uses of p-values and complementary measures in medical research: Recent developments in the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks,"ABSTRACT The p-value is a classical proposal of statistical inference, dating back to the seminal contributions by Fisher, Neyman and E. Pearson. However, p-values have been frequently misunderstood and misused in practice, and medical research is not an exception. In recent years, in several statistical and applied journals, a debate erupted about the need of clear guidelines in reporting p-values, which culminated with the publication of the ASA statement in 2016. In this paper, we assess strengths and limitations of p-values and we assert that in applied research the p-value should be supplemented by other measures, such as the Bayes factor, the Bayes false discovery rate and the local Bayes false discovery rate. We also review a recent proposal by Bayarri et al. from a Bayesian perspective that has the advantage of introducing an indicator, the rejection odds, which keeps into account both pre- and post-experimental information, and could also have a straightforward frequentist interpretation. We conduct a delimited numerical study that investigates on the relation of the Bayes factor with its maximum, and of the local Bayes false discovery rate with its minimum under different distributional assumptions and parameter choices. We illustrate the concepts expressed in theory with an example in clinical oncology, namely a randomized trial on the effectiveness of a new chemotherapy for patients with AIDS and Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma.",2019,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Piero Quatto"", ids = ""3252353""); list(name = ""Enrico Ripamonti"", ids = ""5985598""); list(name = ""Donata Marasini"", ids = ""48404093"")",,29699c7ce7b6ec957948b174c698b5b33a5a7d49; 4d0f3171020e1a7d2dc19558d85642cc4a909a32; bec1d1cb03ae1d07c46c0daa72620f42c70be1a2; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; f0c3d3542be1ff02871694059f3232f997146cbc; 0a89c7982f6cc71f298ee0d6f725e3ebe7744a89; 17d7a9a906a3d3889814b62ed592a305673c1773; 20c38854a0c92aa2a20af6ce618bc809eb613efa; 947cd62c713a1604a1864f7d55e716e7730e72f2; 81a65f23474ffceb2481836328608102950da979; e1ea4083d4a964a8a3ad2a882e2c210af02de021; 08f0b646d4798e873b6fd92aab6a9d94dd15313c; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 98ec1110cf44d6d782dcdce186f4a0123733ce83; bf1849fd8943754ae191cbbc62b296f70975d096; c74ebf9bdfbf9c31860a2e8db73af8f2dfc2f987; ba74d0bfdb58cb19177d64aa57ab03f5d0af7734; 51f6d7eb5b1f55ceeedd639faf077ce8a1404819; ef62bb4bd04680e40a394776e70b9208bcba0c2a; edbdd4d8c8698d538836bb5abffd37b432033d05; 473aed5ddabee5daec75829b8e0e430da4e53019; 5fb59607de268996a3712d9ea4e0220c7822013c; 8f491657307dfc68c205979eb51b2ef63199cc15; 238a09dc7231cb2524a1f165335ccd39071f5b3b; 8ad6d501eac936c9d9b780eca017d5d1d1e59fae; e0795969e605e80c62c4120000766280bcd9ab83; 4544cdde8dcabfbfafef8731d3649255b363e721; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 4e2f43dab69d690dc86422949e410ebf37f522d4; 615338ef37fbc51efa979b046dc26b0250669941; 28a215515d10b0ccadef846c61894e2e8a4ff65a; d8897a591fdc256a0084a8f91c3ff1156617e163; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; 48f213b2737afb07133856ee4254f956017fbf8d; 87022b537acec72e56bcd13e0a578ad9538f7c5e; d2545c297353871209521ecd0604667716a9ef93; df851d9b937aa7a3f00e8232c1485fba60fff996; f02e59d9bd9e5b2fd3720fc214c5357a6ed8622f; e904e61578b1114bbe99e17849cb7f93980ff9ca; 0b842534c5c4e0117cfc3ab0b78d74c755d40aaa; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 99a0ee68b45be3e72ebe9c9833f620ee77ee5d22; 1e23f312f822860510cb044fb6facdbd6e683031; b49d898e41680e3d475fedc8a296bb874682fce6; 4e79451dba8826975b516ea9a6e1ab252b87a063; 3b84991c4b7e8d956ad72015091066055173284b; 3ace8fea1e22ac42546178c3246a80b080679775; 73e77044c4909bc6189b2365f3d8189409a931ad; 8dc6179861acca80fc8f76efeabbce73c81c8cfb; e013fbf7b7e05a39e2494b912c19d2350baa9817; 5daa721c5e420daf6aaa140065316046f7c62fe1; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; 8ebb5eb22dbde845d9fcc2595b706a6d1edbd85d; d4b960c9975710a01b2b36a612500fec4961f1df; 1746ef5dd71d1c7e3b41fb59d06f7970d19a16d6; be8779cb4420cb1187dba71585fadfd447f229a8; a07a64ba110e0f9f7156f3bd1e376f0d2e1cddf1; 51eba02627d06ec34d10b6120508b3470197c7df; 8f13ff7f87176aae326bdd256b2d04da910c7f37; ffbe3116a37aa35f26d85084910281f8d1604ea9; 96ef799148b63e2f4399cb454b1dd1b0c6836c3d; 99ad63b1c7a70e2022ed0f82671ed1e3e8ef2772; f46938aabd77e41424fc766820ba77b0e21aba08; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4d8a5338042da99819746ff835b6f299135e2023; a9cf24e2758f831dc134e5058bcc3e62790856eb; 90eb17aade363e5403bb5606b5a94086610ecb7e; 67e7b84a096e57f36768c985936ba82e33607f48; f938e2f9093b6e4408fa0914f765ad3d762e367c; 6544f1e197c8bb999331195368d5c46dbc7d639a; 2cd88b943ecf5d15fa0de5450ea77143c43e230a,Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics,30,121 - 142

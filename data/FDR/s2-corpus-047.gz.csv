e38b53ad95f12b50bab0c2f8cc56bbb09a8ad895,A genome-wide association study in a large F2-cross of laying hens reveals novel genomic regions associated with feather pecking and aggressive pecking behavior,"BackgroundFeather pecking and aggressive pecking in laying hens are serious economic and welfare issues. In spite of extensive research on feather pecking during the last decades, the motivation for this behavior is still not clear. A small to moderate heritability has frequently been reported for these traits. Recently, we identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with feather pecking by mapping selection signatures in two divergent feather pecking lines. Here, we performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) for feather pecking and aggressive pecking behavior, then combined the results with those from the recent selection signature experiment, and linked them to those obtained from a differential gene expression study.MethodsA large F2 cross of 960 F2 hens was generated using the divergent lines as founders. Hens were phenotyped for feather pecks delivered (FPD), aggressive pecks delivered (APD), and aggressive pecks received (APR). Individuals were genotyped with the Illumina 60K chicken Infinium iSelect chip. After data filtering, 29,376 SNPs remained for analyses. Single-marker GWAS was performed using a Poisson model. The results were combined with those from the selection signature experiment using Fisherâ€™s combined probability test.ResultsNumerous significant SNPs were identified for all traits but with low false discovery rates. Nearly all significant SNPs were located in clusters that spanned a maximum of 3Â Mb and included at least two significant SNPs. For FPD, four clusters were identified, which increased to 13 based on the meta-analysis (FPDmeta). Seven clusters were identified for APD and three for APR. Eight genes (of the 750 investigated genes located in the FPDmeta clusters) were significantly differentially-expressed in the brain of hens from both lines. One gene, SLC12A9, and the positional candidate gene for APD, GNG2, may be linked to the monomanine signaling pathway, which is involved in feather pecking and aggressive behavior.ConclusionsCombining the results from the GWAS with those of the selection signature experiment substantially increased the statistical power. The behavioral traits were controlled by many genes with small effects and no single SNP had effects large enough to justify its use in marker-assisted selection.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vanessa Lutz"", ids = ""46467381""); list(name = ""Patrick Stratz"", ids = ""8843580""); list(name = ""Siegfried Preuss"", ids = ""36695025""); list(name = ""Jens Tetens"", ids = ""6692786""); list(name = ""Michael A.

18a48ee7002106567fd3062af839f0d5db304b8b,A Functional Haplotype Implicated in Vulnerability to Develop Cocaine Dependence is Associated with Reduced PDYN Expression in Human Brain,"Dynorphin peptides and the Îº-opioid receptor are important in the rewarding properties of cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. We tested polymorphisms of the prodynorphin gene (PDYN) for association with cocaine dependence and cocaine/alcohol codependence. We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located in the promoter region, exon 4 coding, and 3â€² untranslated region, in 106 Caucasians and 204 African Americans who were cocaine dependent, cocaine/alcohol codependent, or controls. In Caucasians, we found point-wise significant associations of 3â€²UTR SNPs (rs910080, rs910079, and rs2235749) with cocaine dependence and cocaine/alcohol codependence. These SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium, comprising a haplotype block. The haplotype CCT was significantly experiment-wise associated with cocaine dependence and with combined cocaine dependence and cocaine/alcohol codependence (false discovery rate, q=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). We investigated allele-specific gene expression of PDYN, using SNP rs910079 as a reporter, in postmortem human brains from eight heterozygous subjects, using SNaPshot assay. There was significantly lower expression for C allele (rs910079), with ratios ranging from 0.48 to 0.78, indicating lower expression of the CCT haplotype of PDYN in both the caudate and nucleus accumbens. Analysis of total PDYN expression in 43 postmortem brains also showed significantly lower levels of preprodynorphin mRNA in subjects having the risk CCT haplotype. This study provides evidence that a 3â€²UTR PDYN haplotype, implicated in vulnerability to develop cocaine addiction and/or cocaine/alcohol codependence, is related to lower mRNA expression of the PDYN gene in human dorsal and ventral striatum.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vadim P Yuferov"", ids = ""46662854""); list(name = ""Fei Ji"", ids = ""145765220""); list(name = ""David A.

9fc1c76952e225263e05af7708770a898cd756df,Identification of a Novel ANKK1 and Other Dopaminergic (DRD2 and DBH) Gene Variants in Migraine Susceptibility,"The dopaminergic system plays an important role in migraine and its clinical subtypes. Hypersensitization of dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2) in migraine led to successful administration of receptor antagonists in antimigraine therapy. Ankyrin repeats and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene in DRD2 loci is linked to comorbid neurological disorders. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) is responsible for maintaining dopamine-to-norepinephrine ratio implicated in migraine pathophysiology. Therefore, we aimed to look for association of functional variants in ANKK1 (rs1800497), DRD2 (rs6275 and rs1799732) and DBH (rs7239728 and rs1611115) genes with migraine susceptibility. The present study was carried out in two dependent cohorts (nprimaryÂ =Â 208, nsecondaryÂ =Â 127, ncontrolsÂ =Â 200). The results of the cohorts were pooled by meta-analysis using Fisherâ€™s and Mantelâ€“Haenszel test. Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg false discovery rate test was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Computer algorithm-based TANGO, WALTZ and LIMBO predictions were used to evaluate the effect of missense polymorphism (rs1800497). For ANKK1 polymorphism, variant genotype and allele showed significant associations with migraine risk. A significant protective effect of variant DRD2 rs6275 polymorphism was noticed. DBH rs7239728 imparted significant risk at genotypic, allelic and carrier analyses. We identified a risk haplotype in DRD2 loci. Two genotype interactions between ANKK1rs1800497 and DBHrs72393728 polymorphisms showed significant risks. The variant gene product of ANKK1 rs1800497 was predicted with decreased aggregation of ANKK1 protein.

2f6bf119a3dfcbb2916ef83e2d4bdf3b7fad6eca,Association of loblolly pine xylem development gene expression with single-nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Variation in the expression of genes with putative roles in wood development was associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a population of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) that included individuals from much of the native range. Association studies were performed using 3938 SNPs and expression data obtained using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) for 106 xylem development genes in 400 clonally replicated loblolly pine individuals. A general linear model (GLM) approach, which takes the underlying population structure into consideration, was used to discover significant associations. After adjustment for multiple testing using a false discovery rate correction, 88 statistically significant associations (Q<0.05) were observed for 80 SNPs with the expression data of 33 xylem development genes. Thirty SNPs caused nonsynonymous mutations, 18 resulted in synonymous mutations, 11 were in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), 1 was in a 5' UTR and 20 were in introns. Using AraNet, we found that Arabidopsis genes with high similarity to the loblolly pine genes involved in 21 of the 88 statistically significant associations are connected in functional gene networks. Comparisons of gene expression values revealed that in most cases the average expression in plants homozygous for the rare SNP allele was lower than that of plants that were heterozygous or homozygous for the abundant allele. Although there are association studies of SNPs and expression profiles for humans, Arabidopsis and white spruce, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of such an association genetic study in pines. Functional validation of these associations will lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of phenotypic differences in wood development among individuals in conifer populations.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sreenath Reddy Palle"", ids = ""39724254""); list(name = ""Candace M Seeve"", ids = ""40351873""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

f848a01ea51a4e14552b58521a92d170484baf63,Genome-wide profiling identifies associations between lupus nephritis and differential methylation of genes regulating tissue hypoxia and type 1 interferon responses,"OBJECTIVE
Previous studies have shown that differential DNA methylation is associated with SLE susceptibility. How DNA methylation affects the clinical heterogeneity of SLE has not been fully defined. We conducted this study to identify differentially methylated CpG sites associated with nephritis among women with SLE.


METHODS
The methylation status of 428â€…229 CpG sites across the genome was characterised for peripheral blood cells from 322 women of European descent with SLE, 80 of whom had lupus nephritis, using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Multivariable linear regression adjusting for population substructure and leucocyte cell proportions was used to identify differentially methylated sites associated with lupus nephritis. The influence of genetic variation on methylation status was investigated using data from a genome-wide association study of SLE. Pathway analyses were used to identify biological processes associated with lupus nephritis.


RESULTS
We identified differential methylation of 19 sites in 18 genomic regions that was associated with nephritis among patients with SLE (false discovery rate q<0.05). Associations for four sites in HIF3A, IFI44 and PRR4 were replicated when examining methylation data derived from CD4+ T cells collected from an independent set of patients with SLE. These associations were not driven by genetic variation within or around the genomic regions. In addition, genes associated with lupus nephritis in a prior genome-wide association study were not differentially methylated in this epigenome-wide study. Pathway analysis indicated that biological processes involving type 1 interferon responses and the development of the immune system were associated with nephritis in patients with SLE.


CONCLUSIONS
Differential methylation of genes regulating the response to tissue hypoxia and interferon-mediated signalling is associated with lupus nephritis among women with SLE. These findings have not been identified in genetic studies of lupus nephritis, suggesting that epigenome-wide association studies can help identify the genomic differences that underlie the clinical heterogeneity of SLE.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Amanda Mok"", ids = ""46559482""); list(name = ""Olivia Solomon"", ids = ""144050997""); list(name = ""Renuka R.

67f28f5cc970429f9f4f94f077f51551ec3c354c,The evolution of gene expression in mouse hippocampus in response to selective breeding for increased locomotor activity.,"The evolution of behavior has been notoriously difficult to study at the molecular level, but mouse genetic technology offers new promise. We applied selective breeding to increase voluntary wheel running in four replicate lines of Mus domesticus (S mice) while maintaining four additional lines through random breeding to serve as controls (C mice). The goal of the study was to identify the gene expression profile of the hippocampus that may have evolved to facilitate the increased voluntary running. The hippocampus was of interest because it is known to display marked physiological responses in association with wheel running itself. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays representing 11,904 genes. To control for the confounding influence of physical activity itself on gene expression, animals were housed individually without access to running wheels, and were sampled during the day when they are normally inactive. Two-month-old female mice in estrus were used (n = 16 total; two per line; 8 S and 8 C). After correcting for an acceptable false discovery rate (10%), 30 genes, primarily involved in transcription and translation, significantly increased expression whereas 23 genes, distributed among many categories including immune function and neuronal signaling, decreased expression in S versus C mice. These changes were relatively small in magnitude relative to the changes in gene expression that occur in the hippocampus in response to wheel running itself. A priori tests of dopamine receptor expression levels demonstrated an increase of approximately 20% in the expression of D2 and D4 receptors. These results suggest that relatively small changes in the expression patterns of hippocampal genes underlie large changes in phenotypic response to selection, and that the genetic architecture of running motivation likely involves the dopaminergic system as well as CNS signaling machinery.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anne M.

70b226fd8048749e1c809b13dd228100cf0e9cd5,Quantitative Shotgun Proteomics Analysis of Rice Anther Proteins after Exposure to High Temperature,"In rice, the stage of development most sensitive to high temperature stress is flowering, and exposure at this stage can result in spikelet sterility, thereby leading to significant yield losses. In this study, protein expression patterns of rice anthers from Dianxi4, a high temperature tolerant Japonica rice variety, were compared between samples exposed to high temperature and those grown in natural field conditions in Korea. Shotgun proteomics analysis of three replicate control and high-temperature-treated samples identified 3,266 nonredundant rice anther proteins (false discovery rate < 0.01). We found that high levels of ATP synthase, cupin domain-containing proteins, and pollen allergen proteins were present in rice anthers. Comparative analyses of 1,944 reproducibly expressed proteins identified 139 differentially expressed proteins, with 95 increased and 44 decreased in response to high temperature conditions. Heat shock, DnaK family, and chaperone proteins showed highly increased expression, suggesting that the high temperature tolerance of Dianxi4 is achieved by stabilization of proteins in pollen cells. Trehalose synthase was also highly increased after heat treatment, suggesting a possible role for trehalose in preventing protein denaturation through desiccation.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mijeong Kim"", ids = ""40652931""); list(name = ""Hijin Kim"", ids = ""3663081""); list(name = ""Wondo Lee"", ids = ""4197271""); list(name = ""Yoonjung Lee"", ids = ""40346424""); list(name = ""Soon-Wook Kwon"", ids = ""47595484""); list(name = ""Joohyun Lee"", ids = ""38294753"")",9fc18f60c3f89639b928222382e5ed845f5a00cf; e117dfcfd77449bde7afea4a4e92e95aaa3a57e6; b9459dd9479b2a782a95445ad39d1c2d6bcab9d7; 1bfe17db19f9333fe49acef4ed74263e6edb739b; 22ace6e64b3349ea3fdcca3988f6ee6ddf33ce68; 4a5aea2aa54983ce491ea913a208b0199d0877b6; de4d0b48dc8160d32763fd36284d390c8a0a74b8; 407191a69f7456207d2cd195f64b7addb6966882; 7eafb1d60d71ef5e228d487748710f7c7f6cd9e3; a873c0ff009ff38fc39c7cb50dc851a14fd0663e; 02282ffb820a91285dc5376f5a786fa62c839ede; 52ca9fa0be40ad39b5b8548f52fc9c37337ea137; 963ae8e02835490373f7ffd57ab24e638a5c6364,fd7933a4dd46aeb2630d20f520f1ada2f5f572a8; 28d6fc4e85616e9131674bda696982b628fb8b61; 1ae856dc44cb423624a5cd25f8dab92b86aa4fe2; a461d5dca8bd6ba6a5fa2db291e56b2c098e575a; 28f058d23eb1ccb1c43bb8fdefee0d3a4f58dd2c; 9df21c6a3a56d880d13d258359791808c218a271; db0eaeef812c7d33e22986a12e41ac92e5f91da0; c3aa17eb1c84983b5bb0d6cd4aad2e575322c331; 9a28d464abc296041aec67de7a86740453e7dc34; 5bae2dbe813c0cb9910270a9406f13a879857e5a; 49e874725edf96e97d415744f2f38f33bd9bb8b7; 314394396fe89512af1347294945672c410e6b04; 54c3adb4fe49184d3527ebd93810ef38c709bb77; ac80db7e5599f9fc2e56fbc68230d8b12b1bc3f9; 1e5a074f391c45ab9f5200e1950edec3e53a29d7; ba2f5300070c1f6b86320f91dfb825084ea7f8f8; b6321e3a1734c1d18f78419ea30bff7f32fd5523; 9c318feb547138085b124d1dcd1a06a09f677ef7; 3e470fed0bc71f017e876386d1951cc522672d60; 1a38c29d2a1470db87b6d2734583a68d158dd07d; 63ab23226650eab2ec89fd8528a3022545b1b7ae; 496d1a7ffd07e4d6ffe0067cac5329cf0a6b25ea; 5aed05ced445fed9cc64fa39279391152fc522b4; dfdb817d62780632181758e9e945597e006916a0; 543a8cd65bf6a8d0f851b8e368f83e4abeb60400; f6cae3a38a3bdcaa2c2889780ac5e6e1117335c0; 4195390978eb8ac8d8011fe23a670b048ee9bfa1; 933e11db848c8941bd4fd74fdeb27e0a83eae270; 96e68e56f85d220c18f85b2918bbcce54c573be3; 412af22a98cbe8a99fe31729b892381c9be8dac3,International Journal of Genomics,2015,

We observed symptoms/diseases reported within three months by 16 357 individuals aged 1+ years in 17 villages of Mayuge District, Uganda. Symptoms were mapped to the Human Phenotype Ontology. Comorbidity networks were constructed. An edge between two symptoms/diseases was generated if the relative risk greater than 1, Ï• correlation greater than 0, and local false discovery rate less than 0.05. We studied how network structure and flagship symptom profiles varied against biosocial factors. 88.05% of individuals (14 402/16 357) reported at least one symptom/disease. Young children and individuals in worse-off householdsâ€”low socioeconomic status, poor water, sanitation, and hygiene, and poor medical careâ€”had dense network structures with the highest comorbidity burden and/or were conducive to the onset of new comorbidities from existing flagship symptoms, such as fever. Flagship symptom profiles for fever revealed self-misdiagnoses of fever as malaria and sexually transmitted infections as a potentially missed cause of fever in individuals of reproductive age.

c932c7cf0dbe989f6f50d8baf01d79d9d769d6c4,Rheumatoid Arthritis Candidate Genes Identification by Investigating Core and Periphery Interaction Structures,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term systemic inflammatory disease that primarily attacks synovial joints and ultimately leads to their destruction. The disease is characterized by series of processes such as inflammation in the joints, synovial hyperplasia, and cartilage destruction leading to bone erosion. Since RA being a chronic inflammatory complex disease, there is a constant need to develop novel and dynamic treatment to cure the disease. In the present research, network biology and gene expression profiling technology are integrated to predict novel key regulatory molecules, biological pathways, and functional network associated with RA. The microarray datasets of synovial fibroblast (SF) (GSE7669) and macrophages (GSE10500 and GSE8286), which are the primary cells in the synovium and reported as the key players in the pathophysiology of RA, were considered for identification of signature molecules related to RA. The statistical analysis was performed using false discovery rate (FDR), t-test, one-way anova, and Pearson correlation with favorable p-value. The K-core analysis depicted the change in network topology which consisted of up- and downregulated genes network, resulted in six novel meaningful networks with seed genes OAS2, VCAN, CPB1, ZNF516, ACP2, and OLFML2B. Hence, we propose that, differential gene expression network studies will be a standard step to elucidate novel expressed gene(s) globally.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Sachidanand Singh"", ids = ""3338428""); list(name = ""V.

When these loci were further analyzed in RiceChip database (http://www.ricechip.org/), it was expected that 8 genes in Heat Shock Protein (Hsps) family, including LOC_Os06g06490 (Os.11376.1.S1_at), LOC_Os10g07210 (Os.18511.1.S1_at), LOC_Os08g38300 (OsAffx.29587.1.S1_s_at), LOC_Os06g13060 (OsAffx.4821.1.S1_at), LOC_Os06g11440 (Os.7473.1.S1_at), LOC_Os10g07200 (Os.14575.1.S1_a_at), LOC_Os12g38180 (Os.38164.1.S2_at) and LOC_Os01g32870 (OsAffx.11289.1.S1_x_at), are involved in the control of the rice mutant tolerance to high temperatures Thus, SFP technique can be used to discover polymorphism between the genomes effectively. à¸„ à¸²à¸ª à¸²à¸„à¸±à¸: single feature polymorphism (SFP), à¸—à¸™à¸—à¸²à¸™à¸•à¹ˆà¸­à¸­à¸¸à¸“à¸«à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´à¸ªà¸¹à¸‡, heat shock protein (Hsp)",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Kularb Srisookklang"", ids = ""1419776736""); list(name = ""Sulaiman Che-abu"", ids = ""1397163883""); list(name = ""Vinitchan Ruanjaichon"", ids = ""3293475""); list(name = ""Apichart Vanavichit"", ids = ""48825209""); list(name = ""Poonpipope"", ids = ""1419795271""); list(name = ""Chanate Malumpong"", ids = ""88545090"")",,2bf917dbec7177c16411f73c9965910bb6f1a595; d17cab3b15ff0e5e4f1c98f0e8c5764f0a05905a; 0fa1977c6a5d97f193f7305231a0a99d143e0499; 820fda50cd290a6441a84c68651f5b9960300b04,,,
0a7f3578767dd94ee821a81322c52f186bf75a00,Linkage and association analyses of glaucoma related traits in a large pedigree from a Dutch genetically isolated population.,"BACKGROUND
Despite extensive research on the genetic determinants of glaucoma, the genes identified to date explain only a small proportion of cases in the general population.


METHODS
Genome-wide linkage and association analyses of quantitative traits related to glaucoma were performed: intraocular pressure, size and morphology of the optic disc (individual and combined by method of principal components) and thickness of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), in a large pedigree from a genetically isolated Dutch population.


RESULTS
For the size of the optic disc, the study demonstrated a significant linkage signal (logarithm of odds (LOD)=3.6) at the LRP1B region on chromosome 2q21.2-q22.2 and significant association (p=8.95Ã—10(-12)) with the previously reported CDC7/TGFBR3 locus at 1p22. For parameters describing morphology of the optic disc, the study obtained significant linkage signal (LOD=4.6) at regions SIRPA and RNF24/PANK2 at 20p13 (false discovery rate (FDR) based q value <0.05) and genome-wide significant association (p=2.38Ã—10(-9)) with a common variant in the RERE gene at 1p36. Suggestive linkage and association signals indicated loci for morphology of the optic disc at 2q31-q33 (IGFBP2 locus) and for RNFL thickness at 3p22.2 (DCLK3 locus) and 14q22-q23 (SIX1 locus).


CONCLUSION
This study identified new linkage regions at 20p13 (SIRPA and RNF24/PANK2 loci) and 2q33-q34 (IGFBP2 locus) for parameters describing morphology of the optic disc. The results of the study also suggested common genetic control of these parameters and RNFL thickness by SIX1 and doublecotin family genes. Finally, association signals for the recently reported RERE and LRP1B loci and the well known CDC7, TGFBR3, and ATOH7 loci were replicated.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tatiana I.

b2366d057204c401615b8cdead5cf47ef4b9dbc3,Adaptive control of the false discovery rate in voxel-based morphometry.,"Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is widely used as a high-resolution approach to understanding the relationship between anatomical structures and variables of interest. Controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR) is an attractive choice for thresholding the resulting statistical maps and has been commonly used in fMRI studies. However, we caution against the use of nonadaptive FDR control procedures, such as the most commonly used Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (B-H), in VBM analyses. This is because, in VBM analyses, specific risk factors may be associated with volume change in a global, rather than local, manner, which means the proportion of truly associated voxels among all voxels is large. In such a case, the achieved FDR obtained by nonadaptive procedures can be substantially lower than the nominal, or controlled, level. Such conservatism deprives researchers of power for detecting true associations. In this article, we advocate for the use of adaptive FDR control in VBM-type analyses. Specifically, we examine two representative adaptive procedures: the two-stage step-up procedure by Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli (2006: Biometrika 93:491-507) and the procedure of Storey and Tibshirani ([2003]: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:9440-9445). We demonstrate mathematically, with simulations, and with a data example that these procedures provide improved performance over the B-H procedure.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sining Chen"", ids = ""2316257""); list(name = ""Chi Wang"", ids = ""29789550""); list(name = ""Lynn E.

bbacfc716acccf91b56c9194ab5c66d8582df5c7,A Spare Support Vector Machine Based Fault Detection Strategy on Key Lubricating Interfaces of Axial Piston Pumps,"Fault detection of axial piston pumps is of great significance to improve the reliability and life of fluid power systems. However, it is difficult to detect multiple faults on key lubricating interfaces due to the liquid-solid coupling. This paper proposes a fault detection strategy of the three key lubricating interfaces based on the one against all (OAA) and spare support vector machine (SSVM). The parameter sparsity is imposed to deal with the performance degradation of OAA-SVM model as a result of the imbalanced dataset. Experimental investigations on the benchmark dataset and axial piston pumps are carried out. Results show that the OAA-SSVM model accuracies of the benchmark dataset and axial piston pump are 96.67% and 95.83%, respectively, which are better than the OAA-SVM model. The recall rates of the bearing fault 3 and pump fault 2 can decrease by 13.33% and 10.00%, respectively. And the false discovery rates of the normal bearing and normal pump can be reduced by up to 7.58% and 6.24%, respectively. Besides, the OAA-SSVM model can improve the feature sparsity. Results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting multiple faults of axial piston pumps.",2019,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shiqi Xia"", ids = ""4557582""); list(name = ""Junhui Zhang"", ids = ""29925319""); list(name = ""Shaogan Ye"", ids = ""30749603""); list(name = ""Bing Xu"", ids = ""144738865""); list(name = ""Weidi Huang"", ids = ""73268411""); list(name = ""Jiawei Xiang"", ids = ""1814589"")",b7c863f7a555fc24f6a5662b904a76625f1d1dcd,2f52a368ba5657ffc5ba0180bff2cfbf396c4c0c; 09be08f07e5c9ce3a46586fdac95c3075d386f50; 6933691ccde2225e6de7ea3a1eac921dad641671; 7dfd264136c5c1c95e929ea6320ec128ec3a1e14; 04fd278c01df1564e741b4c6e052fc1c5924ab8d; c19d4a40791520633e1f169ee5d701579a64b830; bd656cd6b1f04714fc455714dcb989f77b21f6dd; 971aefdf99e21e3a4b764b73e806aaa5ba34e524; adeb8e7b4297b82c164bd730db87170569a6b8bd; d4f2f78a1f33352e687e593a13df6d3a7a1b6978; af49939207e70ff9b6b0f4cf6bc506592f287888; 1252dba0d8bf22624c2ce839f5854439d0d85dfe; 625db62b00e943b9c9fbc9a37fff3703a68ffe8f; cd2ebffd17fb5bcc2254a8478c148f975de4dec1; 27cb30fc466dafe797ced97e18bdc4674b924d51; 2827625aad68b37800382261df83a930ae3df7fa; 632b103b4b3d985ddb416d301c02c058b99f4773; 560eb03aed0af56b8036eff16c391ac35b1461f5; 33bcb307e54db51c472dbcf89a97771f8837b3db; b0f00743fad4fdf4cf66a75defdc68b292716e89; c17b542a8de0dad4848558f331da82f86b8b88a8; 07f01d53635dc1ed6fb5b658d6940b123d2206f4; caa71144a1cd543c8f86ebfcb0b6e94ff1f770e5; 900d842fa47437e01f23b388ebb68feb40f323ee; a3d75f9954f4e97658e7306c973bde636f4b4e51; a499f3aa61b10b790c84e6677e91b1cd999811c2; 1466286cca601f3a972fb2d572b131c435ae65db; 21a87f9c2b834e0217f89f6fbbd05a942d3999c0; 2a25789eeb5dbeebc03a7e91720fe03e446103ee; a25876679ac495e3e4b1603a57aa2b62c6d94137; 51740e1acb0264b2e8d522098c7039efe4b8178a; 150a338094dc7e483d7d054bfa41955d509fc505; 101f531a711e58579d501c1d7b09f138a841233d,IEEE Access,7,178177-178186
1dc173c4d2882e46c0f6dfd7bd2b343a128d7e10,Distribution of tract deficits in schizophrenia,"BackgroundGray and white matter brain changes have been found in schizophrenia but the anatomical organizing process underlying these changes remains unknown. We aimed to identify gray and white matter volumetric changes in a group of patients with schizophrenia and to quantify the distribution of white matter tract changes using a novel approach which applied three complementary analyses to diffusion imaging data.Methods21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 matched control subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and white matter volume differences were investigated using Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM). White matter diffusion changes were located using Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and quantified within a standard atlas. Tracts where significant regional differences were located were examined using fiber tractography.ResultsNo significant differences in gray or white matter volumetry were found between the two groups. Using TBSS the schizophrenia group showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) compared to the controls in regions (false discovery rate <0.05) including the genu, body and splenium of the corpus callosum and the left anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC). Using fiber tractography, FA was significantly lower in schizophrenia in the corpus callosum genu (pâ€‰=â€‰0.003).ConclusionsIn schizophrenia, white matter diffusion deficits are prominent in medial frontal regions. These changes are consistent with the results of previous studies which have detected white matter changes in these areas.

0ddea80a0240a56c008a012a507bfb885001f859,Effect of growth hormone on the liver transcriptome profile during established lactation in the dairy cow.,"Milk production involves a coordinated metabolic response from multiple tissues. Administration of growth hormone (GH) to lactating cows provides an endocrine signal that redirects nutrients towards milk production. Hepatic responses to GH define the nutrient supply to peripheral organs both directly and indirectly, through processes such as gluconeogenesis and endocrine modulation. However, the mechanisms controlling these processes in the liver itself have not been completely elucidated. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of GH on gene expression in the liver of lactating dairy cows. Using a 22,690 expressed sequence tags (EST) bovine cDNA microarrays, we examined differences in liver mRNA transcript profiles between four cows treated with a slow-release formulation of GH and four control cows treated with saline solution. We identified 38 unique transcripts in liver that met the criteria of having expression changes greater than +/- 1.2 fold and false discovery rates <0.05. Of these genes affected by GH, 29 were down-regulated and nine were up-regulated. The pathways most affected by GH were carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, molecule transport and small molecule biochemistry. This preliminary study provides further insights into the molecular changes involved in the effects of GH on liver gene expression in the lactating dairy cow.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""David Pacheco"", ids = ""48260372""); list(name = ""KÃ¡tia Nones"", ids = ""49098237""); list(name = ""Quentin L Sciascia"", ids = ""4607083""); list(name = ""McCoard Sa"", ids = ""75095466"")",,01717eb670a47807f0d80b36085c51aaacd299c5; f9694bc41753a5c3fa6bfdcae76eda05c4db5efa; f2c178a082b8810fbbf1678a95762cdb25b0417a; 150618f0c455c2863eef3831140d64544d443bcc; 6b9a731c0c6dd0b823243892d1ddcc778908f14e; 603ac5917ef9220648e2acba82e276a1dd85f4d4; 94eaa8b6b7e4ed0aa9c40b18864059eff933e428; 699ccda2f27508cc9544bf2579213e5292a2aa62; 28d8e49472a8d0e9da99ea0450b22b7d62bcdb3f; efd62404d25b4ea89f49e76d6699228c2762f3ec; 385eb477acd4aa12893e173843af73ea86bc0822; a3b013eb8dc5a35967d24ca4aae180c6d32e939c; ca3488f92ee36ca28f65c315fcbc24d55d5d0ab9; 24fa741c4273cb641ce571e8ab5401635eda08fa; ec27a1f0b5655736eaa7ef20cef274a75fa8ba14; bf04b5ba4374f1c2efb1d793fa98a09aaf751842; 48f6379e5753065e23d6dcfba5f4fff63c883d5a; f6cfdd9aa06dd9b0fcc16da13b48c57afc0a642e; d8a606d603b9ba59814c6275c7e352fc8420047f; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; d29b94a14ddc5e33777373b929b1566b1478df50; 58e0fcb163333c0fad02db5da93da55f2e313464,,70,33-38
cf6c364b0ba258fd3603d6b8da58a144269ef787,Graphical modeling of binary data using the LASSO: a simulation study,"BackgroundGraphical models were identified as a promising new approach to modeling high-dimensional clinical data. They provided a probabilistic tool to display, analyze and visualize the net-like dependence structures by drawing a graph describing the conditional dependencies between the variables. Until now, the main focus of research was on building Gaussian graphical models for continuous multivariate data following a multivariate normal distribution. Satisfactory solutions for binary data were missing. We adapted the method of Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann to binary data and used the LASSO for logistic regression. Objective of this paper was to examine the performance of the Bolasso to the development of graphical models for high dimensional binary data. We hypothesized that the performance of Bolasso is superior to competing LASSO methods to identify graphical models.MethodsWe analyzed the Bolasso to derive graphical models in comparison with other LASSO based method. Model performance was assessed in a simulation study with random data generated via symmetric local logistic regression models and Gibbs sampling. Main outcome variables were the Structural Hamming Distance and the Youden Index.We applied the results of the simulation study to a real-life data with functioning data of patients having head and neck cancer.ResultsBootstrap aggregating as incorporated in the Bolasso algorithm greatly improved the performance in higher sample sizes. The number of bootstraps did have minimal impact on performance. Bolasso performed reasonable well with a cutpoint of 0.90 and a small penalty term. Optimal prediction for Bolasso leads to very conservative models in comparison with AIC, BIC or cross-validated optimal penalty terms.ConclusionsBootstrap aggregating may improve variable selection if the underlying selection process is not too unstable due to small sample size and if one is mainly interested in reducing the false discovery rate. We propose using the Bolasso for graphical modeling in large sample sizes.",2012,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ralf Strobl"", ids = ""101859740""); list(name = ""Eva Grill"", ids = ""3078712""); list(name = ""U.

203cf56b8e1264dbc4d802a1d6b8f2ba7ac68024,Identification and Quantification of Murine Mitochondrial Proteoforms Using an Integrated Top-Down and Intact-Mass Strategy.,"The development of effective strategies for the comprehensive identification and quantification of proteoforms in complex systems is a critical challenge in proteomics. Proteoforms, the specific molecular forms in which proteins are present in biological systems, are the key effectors of biological function. Thus, knowledge of proteoform identities and abundances is essential to unraveling the mechanisms that underlie protein function. We recently reported a strategy that integrates conventional top-down mass spectrometry with intact-mass determinations for enhanced proteoform identifications and the elucidation of proteoform families and applied it to the analysis of yeast cell lysate. In the present work, we extend this strategy to enable quantification of proteoforms, and we examine changes in the abundance of murine mitochondrial proteoforms upon differentiation of mouse myoblasts to myotubes. The integrated top-down and intact-mass strategy provided an increase of âˆ¼37% in the number of identified proteoforms compared to top-down alone, which is in agreement with our previous work in yeast; 1779 unique proteoforms were identified using the integrated strategy compared to 1301 using top-down analysis alone. Quantitative comparison of proteoform differences between the myoblast and myotube cell types showed 129 observed proteoforms exhibiting statistically significant abundance changes (fold change >2 and false discovery rate <5%).",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Leah V Schaffer"", ids = ""37745202""); list(name = ""Jarred W.

8ec0d4c8a330278e97b1824e262b75d2a38f2e1a,Assessing Coverage of Protein Interaction Data Using Captureâ€“Recapture Models,"Protein interaction networks comprise thousands of individual binary links between distinct proteins. Whilst these data have attracted considerable attention and been the focus of many different studies, the networks, their structure, function, and how they change over time are still not fully known. More importantly, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding their size, and the quality of the available data continues to be questioned. Here, we employ statistical models of the experimental sampling process, in particular captureâ€“recapture methods, in order to assess the false discovery rate and size of protein interaction networks. We uses these methods to gauge the ability of different experimental systems to find the true binary interactome. Our model allows us to obtain estimates for the size and false-discovery rate from simple considerations regarding the number of repeatedly interactions, and provides suggestions as to how we can exploit this information in order to reduce the effects of noise in such data. In particular our approach does not require a reference dataset. We estimate that approximately more than half of the true physical interactome has now been sampled in yeast.",2012,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""W P Kelly"", ids = ""16164048""); list(name = ""Michael P.H.

5f1288a158dd7dd3ba66b29efd90e6ded661e7ed,Identification of differentially expressed proteins in direct expressed prostatic secretions of men with organ-confined versus extracapsular prostate cancer.,"Current protocols for the screening of prostate cancer cannot accurately discriminate clinically indolent tumors from more aggressive ones. One reliable indicator of outcome has been the determination of organ-confined versus nonorgan-confined disease but even this determination is often only made following prostatectomy. This underscores the need to explore alternate avenues to enhance outcome prediction of prostate cancer patients. Fluids that are proximal to the prostate, such as expressed prostatic secretions (EPS), are attractive sources of potential prostate cancer biomarkers as these fluids likely bathe the tumor. Direct-EPS samples from 16 individuals with extracapsular (n = 8) or organ-confined (n = 8) prostate cancer were used as a discovery cohort, and were analyzed in duplicate by a nine-step MudPIT on a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. A total of 624 unique proteins were identified by at least two unique peptides with a 0.2% false discovery rate. A semiquantitative spectral counting algorithm identified 133 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the discovery cohort. Integrative data mining prioritized 14 candidates, including two known prostate cancer biomarkers: prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase, which were significantly elevated in the direct-EPS from the organ-confined cancer group. These and five other candidates (SFN, MME, PARK7, TIMP1, and TGM4) were verified by Western blotting in an independent set of direct-EPS from patients with biochemically recurrent disease (n = 5) versus patients with no evidence of recurrence upon follow-up (n = 10). Lastly, we performed proof-of-concept SRM-MS-based relative quantification of the five candidates using unpurified heavy isotope-labeled synthetic peptides spiked into pools of EPS-urines from men with extracapsular and organ-confined prostate tumors. This study represents the first efforts to define the direct-EPS proteome from two major subclasses of prostate cancer using shotgun proteomics and verification in EPS-urine by SRM-MS.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yunee Kim"", ids = ""5132896""); list(name = ""Vladimir Ignatchenko"", ids = ""4691752""); list(name = ""Cindy Q.

1abe188dd46b6a2bb5ccf333891e3a2d253f0d07,Increased power of microarray analysis by use of an algorithm based on a multivariate procedure,"MOTIVATION
The power of microarray analyses to detect differential gene expression strongly depends on the statistical and bioinformatical approaches used for data analysis. Moreover, the simultaneous testing of tens of thousands of genes for differential expression raises the 'multiple testing problem', increasing the probability of obtaining false positive test results. To achieve more reliable results, it is, therefore, necessary to apply adjustment procedures to restrict the family-wise type I error rate (FWE) or the false discovery rate. However, for the biologist the statistical power of such procedures often remains abstract, unless validated by an alternative experimental approach.


RESULTS
In the present study, we discuss a multiplicity adjustment procedure applied to classical univariate as well as to recently proposed multivariate gene-expression scores. All procedures strictly control the FWE. We demonstrate that the use of multivariate scores leads to a more efficient identification of differentially expressed genes than the widely used MAS5 approach provided by the Affymetrix software tools (Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 or GeneChip Operating Software). The practical importance of this finding is successfully validated using real time quantitative PCR and data from spike-in experiments.

It has been proven that ensemble learning can significantly improve selection accuracy, alleviate the instability of traditional selection methods, and reduce false discovery rate (FDR). Therefore, variable selection ensembles (VSEs) have gained much interest in recent years. Stability selection [1], a VSE technique based on subsampling in combination with a base algorithm like lasso, is an effective method to control FDR and to improve selection accuracy in linear regression models. In this paper, we apply it to handle variable selection problems in a Cox model. Some simulated data with various censoring rates are used to study the influence of one parameter Amin in stability selection to its performance. In the meantime, stability selection is compared with other variable selection approaches. The experimental results demonstrate its good performance.",2017,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Qing-Yan Yin"", ids = ""35822669""); list(name = ""Jun-Li Li"", ids = ""49299117""); list(name = ""Chun-Xia Zhang"", ids = ""2147052"")",9c5a2d3e3f823d9690ed30b33e2479bb9bbff9d9,58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; ca31809ff996f4041f723b9b89ff32ad14d66317; 195f6fce4db97519d517756f3ee251762582670c; 5e7c71ea20fb087d64319e8ab51caaf537024cc7; 25cb7e7804f29da4892dd2ccc2acea508cc8bf38; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d4783d05ae9dd82a53883d33a767ef4ab0af789b; b800f9dde3ee805463172f38db62b79b2a8ce98a; 95dc9f19210c3ab703ad9bb61a1d02f9aa2a54b7; 385a508e24ea890ded3c6e21e5ed55f8442d8860; 92e5dcb2ce71ff1c0e344c3fea1085c924e32650; 3608d5f13c7426e1b22260f9042c85ec463bad62; 5293e78c979b3a91da2b748b03727638fcfbedf2; 49474fd116db60f1633ce452e26beabd9480d499; 74845bfebf1a1812892b10b93c3d939b4a8a1ec3; 5f0d051ffcbde45f92daee6395883cd476777ad9; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 802f8e390142afbc3dd6a1d23ef77f4557ceec51; 80b6df0b985e25755bbbcabe3e8662afa65782c0; 43b4e50ebf6112d85846eeac6d05318b91396eda; 8d843a9781a148d9ff52432490917a2f21951af8; 3fa973846114d92101daf43c83d620c35b94dcce; 0da195965176cc015cf7812c1726226a2f2eea49; b9f6e9ac6c1f07a1875b07791ab08a9d37936f14; ea795aa08f642a2d8944f71d7f13a689661d91df; 7a92314ff9ef62aab0f30510225736aa30aa7b84; 61c960f6047dbf9a1c8d31735a0c91348daaa7f1; ee9e8359fbda419a98bc20d8195ae7a7b32a5165; 5f5bbfc164ffde5a124b738fd0de6f3c1e34a390; 4c419c2784c02d0658f0f5a203113c787df71cc1; 399a591052b8afcceb9c3083e50da3759492ab7d; efe973075ac6c86965fdc937e44d5bbac34d00c9,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2017,

Suthanthiran.1 1Nephrology and Hypertension, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; 2Infectious Diseases, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY. Background: The gut microbiome may play a role in the regulation of the immune system and infectious complications, and its association with kidney transplantation outcomes merits evaluation. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 26 kidney transplant recipients and collected serial fecal specimens (n=85) during the fi rst 3 months of transplantation. Using 16S rRNA deep sequencing, we examined the bacterial composition in the 85 fecal specimens and examined whether the fecal microbial community changed following transplantation and whether the alterations were associated with acute rejection (AR) and/or urinary tract infection (UTI). Results: Proteobacteria increased in post-transplantation samples when compared to pre-transplantation samples (P=0.04, Signed Rank test). Three of the 26 recipients developed biopsy-confi rmed AR and biopsy matched fecal specimens showed an increase in Lactobacillales (P=0.04) and a decrease in Clostridiales (P=0.01) and in Bacteriodales (P=0.03) (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). The same 3 transplant recipients developed Enterococcus UTI. Higher fecal abundance of Enterococcus was observed in these kidney graft recipients compared to the abundance in the remaining 23 kidney graft recipients who did not develop Enterococcus UTI (P=0.005) (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). Conclusions: Our pilot study identifi ed alterations in gut microbiome following transplantation. Moreover, differential microbial structure was observed among the kidney graft recipients with acute rejection and Enterococcus UTI and those with no such complications.

Baker.2 1University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh; 2University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom. Accumulating evidence supports regulatory role for human TrB in KTRs. TrB are heterogeneous with variable cytokine expression. Here we have analysed their functional and clinical signifi cance. The phenotype of TrB as Bregs was established in 15 healthy controls (HC). Compared to other B subsets, TrB expressed relatively higher IL10 and lower TNFÎ± (high IL10/TNFÎ±) and exhibited in vitro regulation by selectively suppressing autologous Th1 cytokines. While neutralizing IL10 blocked TrB mediated regulation, blocking TNFÎ± uncovered regulation by memory B cells, confi rming involvement of these cytokines in vitro suppressive activity. Within TrB, we identifi ed phenotypically distinct T1(CD24++CD38++CD20++IgM++CD10+) and T2(CD24+CD38+CD20+IgM+CD10lo) subsets. T1 cells had signifi cantly higher IL10/TNFÎ± and were thereby more polarized towards IL10. Immune regulation by TrB was confi rmed in 88 KTRs. Patients with biopsy proven rejection (n=25) had signifi cantly lower absolute B cells, TrBs, and a lower TrBIL10/TNFÎ± ratio when compared to HC(n=15), patients with stable function (n=41) or graft dysfunction without rejection (n=22). Moreover, lower IL10/TNFÎ± within TrB seen with rejection paralleled a signifi cant fall in T1 cells (lower T1/T2 ratio). Both TrB-IL10/TNFÎ± and T1/T2 ratios effectively distinguished stable patients from those with rejection on ROC analysis (AUC= 0.83&0.88, P<0.001). When divided into tertiles based on either TrB-IL10/TNFÎ± or T1/T2, KTRs in the lowest tertiles of both groups had signifi cantly greater incidence of DSA and deterioration in renal function (Î”eGFR) over 3 yrs from the time of biopsy. Since T1/T2 ratio paralleled IL10/TNFÎ± in its ability to predict graft outcome, its utility as a potential marker of graft dysfunction was validated in two independent samples (n=50, each sample) acquired from a randomized trial comparing alemtuzumab vs. basiliximab induction. All patients from the trial were included and graft dysfunction was calculated as Î”eGFR from 6 mos to 3 yrs post-transplant. In both these sets, patients in the lowest tertile of T1/T2 had worse Î”GFR and DSA. To conclude, we provide evidence for TrB mediated immune regulation which is dependent on both IL10 and TNFÎ±. Within TrB, T1 cells express most IL-10 and the fall in T1/T2 and TrB IL-10/TNFÎ± may be linked. The relative utility of these ratios as biomarkers for allograft dysfunction needs to be determined prospectively. Abstract# 2206 Molecular Signature in the Peripheral Blood for Sub-Clinical Acute Kidney Rejection. J. Friedewald,1 S. Kurian,2 J. Levitsky,1 S. Brietigam,1 J. Charette,1 M. Abecassis,1 D. Salomon.2 1Northwestern Medicine, Chicago; 2Scripps Institute, La Jolla. Background: Sub-clinical acute rejection (SCAR) is defi ned as histologic rejection with normal serum creatinine and is associated with worse long term graft survival. Protocol kidney biopsies (bx) are done at some centers to detect SCAR. Methods: We identifi ed 23 whole blood samples from recipients with SCAR and profi led these using Affymetrix HG-U133 Peg microarrays. We compared these to 21 pts with clinical acute rejection (AR), and 25 with normal bx and a normal serum creatinine (TX). SCAR bx included 16 â€œBorderlineâ€ and 7 Banff 1A (Banff 07). 3-way ANOVA analysis was performed between Groups 1-3. Results: The arrays yielded over 6,000 differentially expressed probesets at p<0.001. Even setting a False Discovery Rate (FDR) cut-off of <10% gave us over 2,500 signifi cantly differentially expressed probesets. For the diagnostic signature, we used only the top 200 differentially expressed probesets as ranked by p values. These 200 top probesets have FDR values of <0.05%. We used 3 different predictive algorithms: Nearest Centroid (NC), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA) to build predictive models. NC, SVM and DLDA picked classifi er sets of 188, 192 and 200 probesets as the best classifi ers, respectively. Table 1 shows the performance of the 3-way NC classifi er using both one-level cross validation as well as Optimism Corrected Bootstrapping (1000 data sets) as described by Harrell. We also tested a 2-way prediction of SCAR vs. TX to further validate that a phenotype as potentially subtle clinically as SCAR can be truly distinguished from TX. At a p-value <0.001, there were 33 probesets whose expression signals highly differentiated SCAR and TX. When these 33 probesets were used in NC to predict SCAR and TX creating a 2-way classifi er, the predictive accuracies with a one-level cross-validation was 96% and with the Harrell 1000 test optimism correction it was 94%. Table 1 shows NC algorithm values. 2206 Molecular Signature in the Peripheral Blood for Sub-Clinical Acute Kidney Rejection. J. Friedewald,1 S. Kurian,2 J. Levitsky,1 S. Brietigam,1 J. Charette,1 M.

The zebrafish is an important animal model for vision science due to rapid and tractable development, persistent neurogenesis of rods throughout the lifespan, and capacity for functional retinal regeneration.ResultsZebrafish rods, and non-rod retinal cells of the xops:eGFP transgenic line, were separated by cell dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by RNA-seq. At a false discovery rate of <â€‰0.01, 597 transcripts were upregulated (â€œenrichedâ€) in rods vs. other retinal cells, and 1032 were downregulated (â€œdepletedâ€). Thirteen thousand three hundred twenty four total transcripts were detected in rods, including many not previously known to be expressed by rods. Forty five transcripts were validated by qPCR in FACS-sorted rods vs. other retinal cells. Transcripts enriched in rods from adult retinas were also enriched in rods from larval and juvenile retinas, and were also enriched in rods sorted from retinas subjected to a neurotoxic lesion and allowed to regenerate. Many transcripts enriched in rods were upregulated in retinas of wildtype retinas vs. those of a zebrafish model for rod degeneration.ConclusionsWe report the generation and validation of an RNA-seq dataset describing the rod transcriptome of the zebrafish, which is now available as a resource for further studies of rod photoreceptor biology and comparative transcriptomics.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chi Sun"", ids = ""46299519""); list(name = ""Carlos A.

f20f7451f17d19c41d74096f7693bf755512dbfd,"Genome-wide analysis reveals extensive genetic overlap between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and intelligence","Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are severe mental disorders associated with cognitive impairment, which is considered a major determinant of functional outcome. Despite this, the etiology of the cognitive impairment is poorly understood, and no satisfactory cognitive treatments exist. Increasing evidence indicates that genetic risk for SCZ may contribute to cognitive impairment, whereas the genetic relationship between BD and cognitive function remains unclear. Here, we combined large genome-wide association study data on SCZ (nâ€‰=â€‰82,315), BD (nâ€‰=â€‰51,710), and general intelligence (nâ€‰=â€‰269,867) to investigate overlap in common genetic variants using conditional false discovery rate (condFDR) analysis. We observed substantial genetic enrichment in both SCZ and BD conditional on associations with intelligence indicating polygenic overlap. Using condFDR analysis, we leveraged this enrichment to increase statistical power and identified 75 distinct genomic loci associated with both SCZ and intelligence, and 12 loci associated with both BD and intelligence at conjunctional FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01. Among these loci, 20 are novel for SCZ, and four are novel for BD. Most SCZ risk alleles (61 of 75, 81%) were associated with poorer cognitive performance, whereas most BD risk alleles (9 of 12, 75%) were associated with better cognitive performance. A gene set analysis of the loci shared between SCZ and intelligence implicated biological processes related to neurodevelopment, synaptic integrity, and neurotransmission; the same analysis for BD was underpowered. Altogether, the study demonstrates that both SCZ and BD share genetic influences with intelligence, albeit in a different manner, providing new insights into their genetic architectures.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Olav B.

82edf4caff761be8057d3527f074f88ce9bf87bb,Identification of MSRA gene on chromosome 8p as a candidate metastasis suppressor for human hepatitis B virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma,"BackgroundThe prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still remains very dismal, which is mainly due to metastasis. In our previous studies, we found that chromosome 8p deletions might contribute to metastasis of HCC. In this study, we aimed to identify the candidate metastatic suppressor gene on chromosome 8p.MethodsOligo-nucleotide microarrays which included 322 genes on human chromosome 8p were constructed to analyze the difference in gene expression profiles between HCC tissues with and without metastasis. The leading differentially expressed genes were identified and selected for further analysis by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Recombinant expression plasmid vectors for each target gene were constructed and transfected into HCC cells and its in vitro effects on proliferation and invasion of HCC cells were also investigated.ResultsSixteen leading differentially expressed genes were identified from the HCC tissues with metastasis compared with those without metastasis (p < 0.01, q < 16 %). Among of the 10 significantly down-regulated genes in HCC with metastasis, methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) had the lowest p value and false discovery rate (FDR), and was considered as a potential candidate for metastasis suppressor gene. Real-time PCR and Western blotting confirmed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of MSRA were significantly decreased in HCC with metastasis compared with those without metastasis (p < 0.001), and MSRA mRNA level in HCCLM6 cells (with high metastatic potential) was also much lower than that of other HCC cell lines. Transfection of a recombinant expression plasmid vector and overexpression of MSRA gene could obviously inhibit cell colony formation (4.33 Â± 2.92 vs. 9.17 Â± 3.38, p = 0.008) and invasion (7.40 Â± 1.67 vs. 17.20 Â± 2.59, p= 0.0001) of HCCLM6 cell line.ConclusionMSRA gene on chromosome 8p might possess metastasis suppressor activity in HCC.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ke-feng Lei"", ids = ""5619551""); list(name = ""Yan-Fang Wang"", ids = ""119917933""); list(name = ""Xiao-qun Zhu"", ids = ""3681724""); list(name = ""Peng-cheng Lu"", ids = ""8244766""); list(name = ""Bing-sheng Sun"", ids = ""4983814""); list(name = ""Hu-Liang Jia"", ids = ""1714823""); list(name = ""Ning Ren"", ids = ""145971499""); list(name = ""Qing-hai Ye"", ids = ""145681410""); list(name = ""Hui-Chuan Sun"", ids = ""50239435""); list(name = ""Lu Wang"", ids = ""143707984""); list(name = ""Zhao-you Tang"", ids = ""4678065""); list(name = ""Lunxiu Qin"", ids = ""143822422"")",c8c8027e546dba80497b06819f32f1dc670214db; a18e6294d810a805c2672e16b6887e460f9572e5; 37af876d570d3ca98cdfdbbbef6bb840f6739a35; 66c9f434e3afa40117d7d1d5b2beec637c311c68; 77eaa2127f1c07e1df5d2626e0750902acd3f80a; e859597c50ce86b5ad2c64ac3f5bc9f67a6cd3f9; dd193ede6fd32b300ddf7bdfb435db4b0645d877; 9239bcc78e54ece571fd464a5e1d0a434102e84b; bd8da77d5c2f412ed3041166db6f029c8c76acb2; d87c1b42ea0d7fefb0bf4878b364b3b7b6f53d8b; 22f2f3ca2dccf606a318433bcef0b7ec603faed1; 19d75ea5e8d5da24471d37b33879c7ca5c4bd14b; 18198b87980ae45f416d5e14a52075e8c42e6656; 824697ccf01df31f3976c7c6d9063fd8d63387ab; dbd48738ddbca25e3476e0edf9aea5514d36a738; 90bf6d270f2859ca868e3fe6aee11f414999f2ec; afca4501b7d39a125f3b393fd0cfa9095a1419db; 20c8c4658a468631e305d6bb0c960459cfa56a42; 5838d478ed401fe3c82241d894cb4f129df107bb; 877f0a1f4e67a7aa13b7f57f27d74e3212feed9b; 131038eb93e981dcf121ec7f9a920329987c0241; cd7bc45a4bb08c265f2dba1e5877fbc8bae80cca,1526ff3c1b33f774c2df67202926b1fb19b9f018; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 86d1af8415e6b70fe55999d6baf99d5d6cdcbaef; 36efb750f2b13f90af773df5e7187d3ff635cf3a; bfad99e9235c0063579a19ca8ab907a002c6c9ab; 56133d51b53d0dd111c6fc3ad27f6fde43633c66; 400a0b858d199c759a577522c3a4532f0dc99f0f; f64258964b25586b3f1ac9180a414d585b64a0ad; 1b4fd84234c146bf98ce63522db42db5eee0cf12; 1d1c1d3761fa088a72cb074d8e20729269e4ac7d; 3c6c89682b391540afba81d1748b1a8774f96a2f; 75ee601e8f1cbc3d1384e4d25cc492e8e3ab2ffd; b3a0113b2f27f63eedb6aa7fae753a94ae9d6fef; 7bb2ea93589eaf223ae7548db5383e36b3e5640e; e1ba79d6d780bcd11d6d4337cb9e63acb9562e32; e3b4358d7cb59f2cd37039e10b2dadcfc1e3ab5f; a016f678aeb1af86bfe5b383e6c40491c95facae; 91c19f7f02bf35b061a0c7994c40e8e3721039e9; 0f8ef4fc563af85744cf6214925a0fbf51edc2a7; eb38864f5b1bf41b88971a7ce51a42455d1db983; 95c568727c532167788ceb8dda6b30badc2ef374; cf735b7535fcbae723ef30056b10dbc0fc18729e; 1f28ba6743a88fe373014f51e271a198fed9ba52; fa8501b5f45c9cf40d1abb714a4d4e66819a8eb2; 58e1df20e07f7be532ce5ed2ddd8dea73ef94990; 69cecee898e055680c56909a98d5bde2f4c9144c; f8b283f87c1c5723a27f54399c37c2555cf991a1; a848df8c182e4f0ab3d5243eb26b3604b205ae7f; 3ab9775a9d8e127399c65c4112b295bcefe9c377; dd22f8e1ecbb9a777222b32541174741e0ddcb9b; 68dd90d6ecd036cd60a1d07212f04e8a8e310249; a962c3cdbe95461fe5f9d21750b001de8062a3b1; b3d0b32656f952901cfaf3a7d67fae2e0c5b9e5d; a7ade2fe52512f897acdbdaa5abfb898e6be4521; 62cb842c444c163b0400a9fe09eff1d189865204; 3f2c5e6df82cfb22d7ec21e65394a84ab725e314; 2859279f455898c14e4e91586d1d7a1718691155; a0e4fc81f38450925c4303265a0c0eace4004d5f; 89426dd474833163dedddd20b2ec01db99d00866; 74ec47a29e1f37fc264b3d811587b99d0047df5e; 02dfa42d5df9c23fcc39ad9fa401d1eca2b24d32; 25793259a06ee170f5fd3204a23d01173467d745; d6234b0053c7ecf9bc2bdf36828c4ec4808cb8a4; 8225b8b69fb438c4ed55c5f51a42942105fbd2ef; 6d53625df1032e5f0f7d48bb3e822b8c5dc8f22b; adb0dd4df285c78bc099e788fafdebbdc57c57a0; ccc158ae0ff55e47f9988216cb4ce96e75e8b6d5; 9631f2961dfbb96a9d7af67e6522f3668a12130e; 1440237b77e954df3ff938e7abe4ca953b068849; f861b3bc2e26fd139f0837e49188dddc0b66e494; f1292d407ce5ea81e76b73c2f4fa390556b0c350; 8976b866dfbcf7679d4b8e941c8961daaf3aa5d7; ef6ab0d37331bd9c085c905ccc10656a19951c70; 7ea10a9179d78d982e9492b8f4357cc659010bee; 1c6c87938a86edadbe740c60b6e6f45dd49a3f79,BMC Cancer,7,172 - 172

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed urine samples from 6 groups of patients classified phenotypically as: non-hypertensive healthy controls (CRL, n1â„49, 30 1 wks), women with idiopathic proteinuria (IP, n1â„415, 28 2 wks), PE mild features (mPE, n1â„416, 33 1 wks), superimposed PE (spPE, n1â„416, 31 1 wks), PE severe features (sPE, n1â„416, 32 1 wks) and HELLP (n1â„416, 29 1 wks). In the discovery phase, urine proteins were enriched by CR precipitation and subjected to UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. The data were analyzed with Myrimatch and IDPicker. Theoretical masses were calculated from the human Uniprot sequence database. Protein IDs from all samples were dimensionally reduced using multidimensional scaling. HELLP samples were clustered (Euclidean distance, average linkage) using silhouette score to control clustering quality. Characteristic proteins for the clusters were determined by variance analysis. RESULTS: 1,747 IDs were identified in the CR precipitate and merged into 690 protein groups. The false discovery rate was 1.12%. These IDs generated good separation for 3 major clinical phenotypes (Figure). Variance analysis yielded Immunoglobulin Kappa Locus protein and Immunoglobulin-like protein (role: immunoglobulin synthesis) for cluster 1, Keratin types I and II for cluster 2 (role: structural framework of epithelial cells), and three Alpha-1Antitrypsin (A0A024R6I7, Q3I0J7, A7L8C5) variants (role: endogenous protease inhibitor) for cluster 3.

90397b9884016d02c64f6b4959b75272e18e0cb3,Analysis of clustered RNA-seq data,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has now become a powerful tool for measuring levels of transcripts. Through this high-throughput technology, we can investigate post-transcriptional modifications, non-coding RNAs, mutations, gene fusion, and changes in gene expression levels. Recently, many methods have been developed to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatment groups. Most of these methods assume that RNA-seq data is generated independently from the different subjects. Nowadays, clustered RNA-seq data are also commonly observed, such as paired RNA-seq data, from the same patient. Unfortunately, existing methods cannot adequately handle clustered RNA-seq data. In this paper, we propose a new testing method, based on the Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) approach, which is widely used to analyse repeatedly measured data.

Supported primarily by the decrease of substrate receptor (SR) proteins of CRLs in cells deficient of a CSN subunit, CSN-mediated cullin deneddylation is believed to prevent autoubiquitination and self-destruction of the SR in active CRLs. However, it is unclear whether the decrease in SRs is solely due to protein destabilization. Moreover, our prior studies have demonstrated that cardiac specific knockout of Cops8 (Cops8-CKO) impairs autophagosome maturation and causes massive necrosis in cardiomyocytes but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Given that Cops8 is nucleus-enriched and a prior report showed its binding to the promoter of several genes and association of its ablation with decreased mRNA levels of these genes, we sought to determine the dynamic changes of myocardial transcriptome in mice with perinatal Cops8-CKO and to explore their functional implications. Methods and Results: Myocardial transcriptomes of Cops8flox/flox , Cops8flox/+::Myh6-Cre, and Cops8flox/flox::Myh6-Cre littermate mice at postnatal 2 and 3 weeks were analyzed. The data were imported into an in-house analysis pipeline using Bioconductor for quantile normalization and statistical analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups at each time point or between time points within the group were revealed by t-test. Genes with p < 0.05 after Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple hypothesis testing were considered as significant DEGs. We found that (1) the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed significant enrichment of DEGs in multiple pathways, especially those responding to oxidative stress, in homozygous Cops8-CKO hearts at both 2 and 3 weeks, corroborating the occurrence of massive cardiomyocyte necrosis at 3 weeks; (2) the decreases in multiple CRL SR proteins were associated with decreased transcript levels; and (3) enrichment of DEGs in the chromatin remodeling pathway and the microtubule motility and vesicle trafficking pathways. Conclusions: Our data are consistent with the notion that Cops8/CSN plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of CRL SRs and in the redox and vesicle trafficking pathways.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ammara Abdullah"", ids = ""6844832""); list(name = ""Kathleen M.

f7b769d2cbfc020a6c223f17d4a7a0823556f95e,Defining Myeloma Patients at High Risk of Developing Bone Disease While on Bisphosphonate Treatment,"Abstract 782 Introduction Myeloma bone disease (BD) impairs quality of life and is also associated with impaired survival. Bisphosphonates can effectively reduce the risk of developing skeletal-related events (SREs); however, 30% of patients still go on to develop the events. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for these patients, and it is important that new drugs are to be developed efficiently in studies based on patients at high risk of developing SREs. We have analyzed 261 presenting myeloma samples for global gene expression profiling to investigate the molecular basis of BD at presentation, as well as to develop a predictive signature for patients at high risk of developing SREs on bisphosphonates. Materials and methods 261 newly-diagnosed myeloma samples were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays and were split into a training set (n=205) and a test set (n=56). Differentially expressed genes between patient groups were identified using significance analysis of microarray (SAM), with a 1000-permutation adjustment and 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Correlation analyses between clinical/cytogenetic groups and the risk of having BD at presentation or developing SREs on treatment were also carried out using Fisher9s exact test/Mannâ€“Whitney U test. In order to predict patients at high risk of developing SREs within 2 years, the statistically associated parameters were incorporated into a multivariate binary logistic model together with the genes identified by SAM. Each gene9s expression values were dichotomised, using the 75 th percentile as a threshold between high expression and low expression. After optimizing the model, ROC curves and corresponding area under curves (AUCs) were generated for the SRE predictor. All the analyses were carried out in R 2.10.0 and Bioconductor. The optimal predictor derived from the training set was validated in a further smaller test set. Results We demonstrated that patients presenting with BD are significantly younger than those without BD, and there is statistically higher proportion of hyperdiploidy and lower percentage of t(4;14) in BD group. SAM identified 50 genes differentially expressed between patients with presenting BD and those without, among which the WNT-signalling antagonist, DKK1, was most significantly differentially expressed. Pathway analysis shows that other associated genes are mainly involved in cell apoptosis and growth factor signalling, which suggests that the biology of the myeloma plasma cells derived from patients with BD is significantly different from those lacking BD. This may explain their differences in outcome. By comparing the patients who had SREs within two years of presentation to those not developing an SRE before progression, we show that higher serum calcium (Ca) level (2.5mmol/L as cut-off), the presence of BD and hyperdiploidy at presentation were significantly associated with the development of an SRE. In an analysis of the genes associated with SRE development, SAM identified 14 genes overexpressed in SRE group, which are either interferon-induced genes, or are involved in cell adhesion, signalling and mitosis. Cumulative incidence analyses confirmed that these genes could significantly discriminate the risk of developing an on-study SRE. Multivariate binary logistic model selection yielded an optimal SRE predictor comprising 7 genes and Ca level. ROC curve showed that the optimal model had an AUC of 0.821, with an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 82% respectively. This predictor was also validated on a test set, confirming the general utility of this approach. Conclusions In this work we confirm that the Wnt-signaling inhibitor, DKK1, is a major mediator of myeloma BD. We go on to develop an expression based predictor, which can identify the patients who develop SREs within two years of presentation despite effective bisphosphonate treatment.

c8f104ce1af44abf2a3e1e9360a2c400e302898c,MAZIE: A mass and charge inference engine to enhance database searching of tandem mass spectra,"Peptide sequence identification using tandem mass spectroscopy remains a major challenge for complex proteomic studies. Peptide matching algorithms require the accurate determination of both the mass and charge of the precursor ion and accommodate uncertainties in these properties by using a wide precursor mass tolerance and by testing, for each spectrum, several possible candidate charges. Using a data acquisition strategy that includes obtaining narrow mass-range MS1 â€œzoomâ€ scans, we describe here a post-acquisition algorithm dubbed mass and charge (Z) inference engine (MAZIE), which accurately determines the charge and monoisotopic mass of precursor ions on a low-resolution Thermo LTQ-XL mass spectrometer. This is achieved by examining the isotopic distribution obtained in the preceding MS1 zoom spectrum and comparing to theoretical distributions for candidate charge states from +1 to +4. MAZIE then writes modified data files with the corrected monoisotopic mass and charge. We have validated MAZIE results by comparing the sequence search results obtained with the MAZIE-generated data files to results using the unmodified data files. Using two different search algorithms and a false discovery rate filter, we found that MAZIE-interpreted data resulted in 80% (using SEQUEST) and 30% (using OMSSA) more high-confidence sequence identifications. Analyses of these results indicate that the accurate determination of the precursor ion mass greatly facilitates the ability to differentiate between true and false positive matches, while the determination of the precursor ion charge reduces the overall search time but does not significantly reduce the ambiguity of interpreting the search results.

527f1268a24c1496571e46bf668d2ff44cc9491a,Annotation of tandem mass spectrometry data using stochastic neural networks in shotgun proteomics.,"MOTIVATION
The discrimination ability of score functions to separate correct from incorrect peptide-spectrum matches in database-searching-based spectrum identification are hindered by many superfluous peaks belonging to unexpected fragmentation ions or by the lacking peaks of anticipated fragmentation ions.


RESULTS
Here, we present a new method, called BoltzMatch, to learn score functions using a particular stochastic neural networks, called restricted Boltzmann machines, in order to enhance their discrimination ability. BoltzMatch learns chemically explainable patterns among peak pairs in the spectrum data, and it can augment peaks depending on their semantic context or even reconstruct lacking peaks of expected ions during its internal scoring mechanism. As a result, BoltzMatch achieved 50% and 33% more annotations on high- and low-resolution MS2 data than XCorr at a 0.1% false discovery rate in our benchmark; conversely, XCorr yielded the same number of spectrum annotations as BoltzMatch, albeit with 4-6 times more errors. In addition, BoltzMatch alone does yield 14% more annotations than Prosit (which runs with Percolator), and BoltzMatch with Percolator yields 32% more annotations than Prosit at 0.1% FDR level in our benchmark.

In this study, texture features were extracted from entire cross-sectional tumoral region in three consecutive slices containing the largest cross-sectional area from each of the four phases. The change in imaging feature between precontrast imaging and each postcontrast phase was calculated. Data dimension reduction and feature selection were performed by conducting (1) pairwise Wilcoxon rank test followed by modified false discovery rate adjustment, and (2) Lasso regression. Multivariate modeling incorporating the selected features was performed using random forest classification method.ResultsHistogram imaging features were informative variables in differentiating between benign and malignant masses, while textures imaging features were of added value in differentiating between subtypes of RCCs. Papillary RCCs were distinguished from clear cell RCCs (sensitivity 65.5%, specificity 88%, and accuracy 77.9%), oncocytomas from clear cell RCCs (sensitivity 67.3%, specificity 88.9%, and accuracy 79.3%), and oncocytomas from papillary and clear cell RCCs (sensitivity 64.7%, specificity 85.9%, and accuracy 77.9%).ConclusionsA combination of histogram and texture imaging features on multiphasic MR can help differentiate histologic cell types in common small renal masses (<â€‰4Â cm).

df3672968e7ed0c6402ae2ba367a3113bcb0e738,A new nonparametric approach for multiplicity control:Optimal Subset procedures,"SummaryA new approach for multiplicity control (Optimal Subset) is presented. This is based on the selection of the best subset of partial (univariate) hypotheses producing the minimal p-value. In this work, we show how to perform this new procedure in the permutation framework, choosing suitable combining functions and permutation strategies. The optimal subset approach can be very useful in exploratory studies because it performs a weak control for multiplicity which can be a valid alternative to the False Discovery Rate (FDR). A comparative simulation study and an application to neuroimaging real data shows that it is particularly useful in presence of a high number of hypotheses. We also show how stepwise regression may be a special case of Optimal Subset procedures and how to adjust the p-value of the selected model taking into account for the multiplicity arising from the possible different models selected by a stepwise regression.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Livio Finos"", ids = ""2340811""); list(name = ""Luigi Salmaso"", ids = ""1967790"")",b2cf876ee71652fcc5d79a771cc6268eb9dfe179; 7a9367a8349ba620efdbac5910e0da7bd9b963ba; 058d051299a2eab95731935386305f9bcb91e1f5; b272f32906202e7585ade81355c073902d26e479; bafb4d0561b01f1b6ce01629cc39d1f024ecb531,d5e22142b1bf2127ef17469f4226fcc7e3a02077; d11f1ac25a813dda546cd2cb7a6cd157afa194dd; 9af4297f5245e211cfdb4fa65960ae363bc93d87; c88d7b4f260ab4e66e274e3dda3780ef2148af37; e010f9c6c345bdb9052d8541a21cef08693838f7; 0514c2895a30b47b7c0449ddc87c5f6b7e4f1556; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 3201d7fd54a4e424185dc0c64e4a02a585191869; d44ceeb3975367407083d2355ce3c30ea9adec32; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 7ef57d33dd28cbccc7eeed735fa1a4400e98b8be; 6cd45f7034f5bd148c225a477412bfbe18fee0b6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fb92547d3d02e6909030b31605187cf06ddc4211; 8ea3b6c6a9b2906c998e127e3cdd2012f1efcde1,Computational Statistics,20,643-654
035e95fb062240312cf94ab0c2c05a70525d9b2b,Dynamic functional connectivity of migraine brain: a resting-state fMRI study.,"Migraine headache is an episodic phenomenon, and patients with episodic migraine have ictal (headache), peri-ictal (premonitory, aura, and postdrome), and interictal (asymptomatic) phases. We aimed to find the functional characteristics of migraine brain regardless of headache phase using dynamic functional connectivity analysis. We prospectively recruited 50 patients with migraine and 50 age- and sex-matched controls. All subjects underwent a resting-state functional MRI. Significant networks were defined in a data-driven fashion from the interictal (>48 hours apart from headache phases) patients and matched controls (interictal dataset) and tested to ictal or peri-ictal patients and controls (ictal/peri-ictal dataset). Both static and dynamic analyses were used for the between-group comparison. A false discovery rate correction was performed. As a result, the static analysis did not reveal a network which was significant in both interictal and ictal/peri-ictal datasets. Dynamic analysis revealed significant between-group differences in seven brain networks in the interictal dataset, among which a frontoparietal network (controls > patients, p=0.0467), two brainstem networks (patients > controls, p=0.0467 and <0.001), and a cerebellar network (controls > patients, p=0.0408 and <0.001 in two states) remained significant in the ictal/peri-ictal dataset. Using these networks, migraine was classified with a sensitivity of 0.70 and specificity of 0.76 in the ictal/peri-ictal dataset. In conclusion, the dynamic connectivity analysis revealed more functional networks related to migraine than the conventional static analysis, suggesting a substantial temporal fluctuation in functional characteristics. Our data also revealed migraine-related networks which show significant difference regardless of headache phases between patients and controls.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mi Ji Lee"", ids = ""6946305""); list(name = ""Bo-yong Park"", ids = ""6016393""); list(name = ""Soohyun Cho"", ids = ""32599120""); list(name = ""Hyunjin Park"", ids = ""69947009""); list(name = ""Sung-tae Kim"", ids = ""48388173""); list(name = ""C.

We describe methods for familywise error control, false discovery rate control and false discovery proportion estimation and confidence, both conceptually and practically, and explain when to use which type of error rate. We elaborate the assumptions underlying the methods, and discuss pitfalls in the interpretation of results. In our discussion we take into account the exploratory nature of genomics experiments, looking at selection of genes before or after testing, and at the role of validation experiments.

4996b3d1a8d19d570ad3f3afd81bec27b653a9ac,Sub-pathway analysis for severe burns injury patients: Identification of potential key lncRNAs by analyzing lncRNA-mRNA profile,"The aim of the study was to identify key long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and related subpathways following severe burn injuries and research their functions. The miRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-miRNA interactions were downloaded from starBase v2.0 database. In addition, mRNA-miRNA interactions were obtained from TarBase, mirTarBase, mir2Disease, miRecords (V4.0) databases. The relationships of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA were constructed. Genes of expression profiling were intersected with mRNA and lncRNA in lncRNA-mRNA interaction. Screened mRNAs were enriched into various pathways and screened lncRNAs were embedded into candidate pathways. Wallenius approximation methods were used to calculate the false discovery rate value of each sub-pathway. Based on the results of significant sub-pathways, the related lncRNA-mRNA network was constructed. A total of 18,081 genes were obtained. The lncRNA-mRNA intersections including 835 lncRNAs, 1,749 mRNAs and 7,693 interacting pairs were constructed. The enriched mRNAs were further enriched into various candidate pathways such as ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes. Several sub-pathways were screened, including ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes and MAPK signaling pathway. The network of pathway-lncRNA-mRNA was constructed.

a857c557b7f04f80ed61a4fe0f6278e791bf5535,Microarray data analysis of neuroblastoma: Expression of SOX2 downregulates the expression of MYCN.,"The present study aimed to identify the genes directly or indirectly correlated with the amplification of MYCN in neuroblastoma (NB). Microarray data (GSE53371) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, and included 10 NB cell lines with MYCN amplification and 10 NB cell lines with normal MYCN copy numbers. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Linear Models for Microarray Data package, and a false discovery rate of <0.05 and |log2FC (fold change)|>1 were selected as cutâ€‘off criteria. Hierarchical clustering analysis and Gene Ontology analysis were respectively performed for the DEGs using the Pheatmap package in R language and The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A proteinâ€‘protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed for the DEGs using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database. Pathway analysis was performed for the DEGs in the PPI network using the WEBâ€‘based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit. The correlation between MYCN and the key gene associated with MYCN was determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. In total, 137 downregulated and 35 upregulated DEGs were identified. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that KCNMB4 was involved in the regulation of action potential in neuron term, and the FOS, GLI3 and GLI1 genes were involved in the extracellular matrixâ€‘receptor interaction pathway. The PPI network and correlation analysis revealed that the expression of SOX2 was directly correlated with the expression of MYCN, and the correlation coefficient of SOX2 and MYCN was â€‘0.83. Therefore, SOX2, KCNMB4, FOS, GLI3 and GLI1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of NB, with the expression of SOX2 downregulating the expression of MYCN.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juntao Bao"", ids = ""33498974""); list(name = ""Luying Qin"", ids = ""14488920""); list(name = ""Lingling Cui"", ids = ""15900988""); list(name = ""Xiaohui Wang"", ids = ""145823606""); list(name = ""Qinglei Meng"", ids = ""34302923""); list(name = ""Linchao Zhu"", ids = ""2948393""); list(name = ""Shufeng Zhang"", ids = ""48691622"")",f86d632db998a7032190a59aa3d3f0f1bb5880b0,2a096748200cc2456313d0e82d78a458c7674ce2; 59fe939d0e223010f25144a314aa1d652e969fca; b00e253eac1a21ad12c689ffb0bd84c8460c0b84; c4bc07e73bfd2ff3e2635d85a7ffd5f4096c1587; 15ce18db2fa2bec97f7e3c56aeaa8d6a71975a26; 2ee952fab9dd7e655d154e65e696f53b3f414c6d; d25eb1f6fb4074ebe8a1e885eec9bb888aad010c; af0d6148b6dca658aaf64f6d0d8c13a8fd9a6d73; 92767f06a195f282411492984216afddffab9707; 7193ab3c22fe22f38b172cefba022c1b3c296c74; 99a065306dcada506ec7b85b5d335cc57bbe1c59; c8c1374add106de523b23ca18b40cb457350cee7; 53b58ff37e68bcf25743c1b807d9ff068bdbb67d; b4ab074fbbd9675ac1b06389ab57334918e517dc; c499e15502de2718f8d171bcd3077f6a71d894c2; 3b69b97c17ec1ce5080535c610b6ee664e3f29a7; 4315a636ef1b1a67a85d933ca7fb8aef7bf6cd5f; 2d3cdc351f2b9ad71cb7fc91cfc2aeef4a1aff4c; 1a8f21ad1176fe74d6b728ee270d7f6f58fe134e; 4aebb4ac524eda23b1e9576ebd7b793c6476a34b; 1fe64df6fa43783143f7ada9341e5df7aa18933f; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bbfb26b3e6595ea1518d82d712b2da08b5c48472; 0e6aefc52cc98104fdd802cd4fa9878d9f5fbca5; ebc172a2a1f7fe7f157e0497ec92d3ffa0ccc451; 7e9d1d3229dc913ffd696157b809ecc47094338a; 26696bd05023f2effdbba2bd13dca3ee7e67cb36; 165e4a079f772099132780603c66b7677d6cb74a; 56638712ded9901f5a5a461f6f16d68d62b0ea91; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; e3dbadc4fb4cfc53cf9e4c7b0e3122fc6cd053a2; 957fed4fe44b005a8cce18ec76736bee2d436432; e2746417c3461c16ae894ad62ef6389a389fda80; d7b474cf6b97ac9d2c3fb45c1cc28ba38cd404d0; ceee6447b291f8052a28c9eb00ca360d6f39f9b1; c20750af39002a262d0ec8b0c9367fc91db5aad0; 890f52ed9bd981078248c4db5dd81bc75b496912; 0644a46d9ae742cd746484c8efcc02c2cfddddaf,Molecular medicine reports,12 5,"

ea0a86ab20d246c6fe46e580dff0aea8b1ea5dc9,"Post-parmest peripherals: fvregen, invcise, and qqvalue","The parmest package is used with Stata estimation commands to produce output datasets (or results-sets) with one observation per estimated parameter, and data on parameter names, estimates, confidence limits, p-values, and other parameter attributes. These results-sets can then be input to other Stata programs to produce tables, listings, plots, and secondary results-sets containing derived parameters. Three recently added packages for post-parmest processing are fvregen, invcise, and qqvalue. fvregen is used when the parameters belong to models containing factor variables, introduced in Stata version 11. It regenerates these factor variables in the results-set, enabling the user to plot, list, or tabulate factor levels with estimates and confidence limits of parameters specific to these factor levels. invcise calculates standard errors inversely from confidence limits produced without standard errors, such as those for medians and for Hodges-Lehmann median differences. These standard errors can then be input, with the estimates, into the metaparm module of parmest to produce confidence intervals for linear combinations of medians or of median differences, such as those used in meta-analysis or interaction estimation. qqvalue inputs the p-values in a results-set and creates a new variable containing the quasi-q-values, which are calculated by inverting a multiple-test procedure designed to control the familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR). The quasi-q-value for each p-value is the minimum FWER or FDR for which that p-value would be in the discovery set if the specified multiple-test procedure was used on the full set of p-values. fvregen, invcise, qqvalue, and parmest can be downloaded from SSC.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Roger L.

Familywise error rate-controlling methods do not scale up well, and false discovery rate-controlling methods do scale up well with increasing k. But neither method scales up well with increasing sample size (n) when testing point nulls. We develop a loss function approach to investigate scale-up properties of various methods; we find that while Efron's recent proposal scales up best when both sample size n and number of tests k increase, but its performance otherwise can be erratic.",2011,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter Westfall"", ids = ""3293881""); list(name = ""Ananda B.

59d9b36909b452a6db3ee3b42ab3b3b8f7a84642,Unravelingthe Molecular Mechanism behind Metabolic Reprogramming Caused by Alterations of the Enzyme Pi3-kinase,"Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play a key role in cancer induction and progression. They directly or indirectly regulate critical metabolic pathways, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway being frequently activated pathway in cancer. The catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol-4,5bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), p110Î±, is the most frequently mutated kinase in human cancer, E542K, E545K, and H1047R mutations being the most common. Expression of hepatic E545K and H1047R p110Î± mutants in vivo shows marked and rapid increase in hepatic lipid and glycogen accumulation in mice with developmental (chronic) liver-specific deletion of p110Î±, which was not seen in mice when wildtype p110Î± is overexpressed. To investigate the logical pathways that could explain the lipid accumulation in mutant expressing mice, RNA sequencing from wildtype, knockout and mutated mouse livers was performed. Read alignment and count quantification was done using the Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the DeSeq2 package. Differentially expressed genes were identified with adjusted p-value of 0.05. Gene ontology analysis was performed on the differentially expressed genes using clusterProfiler, an R package to identify several key pathways which were upregulated and downregulated among the different sample groups. Signaling pathways related to cell cycle processes were mainly upregulated in the mutated samples when compared with the wildtype as well as knockout samples while signaling pathways related to many metabolic processes seem to be downregulated in mutated samples, even though these mutants showed upregulated metabolism by accumulation of lipids and glycogen physiologically. To confirm the results of gene expression data the results have to be cross validated with the gold standard quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Popular scientific abstract â€œCancerâ€ is a broad term which we all are familiar with and its diagnosis can be scary and overwhelming. In simple words, cancer is described as a disease which results due to cellular changes that cause uncontrolled growth and division of cells which crowd the normal cells thus making it hard for the body to function the way it should. The genetic diversity of cancer and the ability of cancerous cells to adapt and evolve makes it extremely difficult to treat the disease. In order to fight the disease, one has to work towards identifying new ways to cure the disease and that can only be done by understanding the complexities behind cancer metabolism. Cells, basic building blocks of all living things, contain numbers of genes which they selectively turn on and off in order to become specialized. Any alteration or abnormal change in the genetic material of a cell can affect the cell in many ways. These mutational effects can be beneficial, harmful or neutral depending upon locations. Cancer being one of the leading causes of death is mainly due to interaction of many factors but all the causes leading to cancer exert their effects on a class of genes called â€œproto-oncogenesâ€ which on mutation changes into its cancer causing â€œoncogenesâ€. Another class of genes associated with cancer are â€œtumor suppressor genesâ€, these genes are responsible for programmed cell death, that is, it tells the cells when to die. Mutation related to these genes leads to uncontrolled cell division thus leading to cancer. Both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are intricately linked to metabolic regulation and to alteration of metabolism in cancer cells relative to that of normal cells which helps gain and maintain malignant properties, making cancer metabolic reprogramming one of the cancer hallmarks. Understanding the basic cancer biology and mechanism behind altered metabolism can be incorporated into designing of newer therapeutic strategies and coming up with individual cancer treatment. This personalized approach to treating cancer patients is becoming widely popular with advances in newer technology. Next Generation sequencing with significant improvements over the years, can be customized in order to fit the requirements of a specific study, has gained popularity in field of oncology to help in diagnosis, classify the cancer, predict the risk associated as well as in providing personalized patient care. In this thesis, the most common pathway which is altered in cancer, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, is studied in normal as well as mutated mouse liver cells using Next Generation sequencing. This pathway contains enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival, lipidand glucose metabolism, which in turn are closely involved in survival, growth, invasion of cancer cells. The key molecules involved in this signaling pathway are receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-bisphosphate and AKT/protein kinase B. PI3K has a catalytic domain p110 and a regulatory domain p85. Abnormalities in the PI3K pathway are common in cancer, with PI3K being a frequent target of mutational activation. The most frequent mutations are seen in the oncogene PIK3CA gene encoding catalytic subunit isoform p110Î±. The differential gene expression profiles from the different sample groups belonging to liver cells of mice was studied using RNA sequencing, a method of RNA profiling using next generation sequencing. This technique enables us to investigate all the RNAs present in all the samples at the same time in high resolution, producing millions of reads, which are then mapped to a reference genome, mouse genome in this case, to give measure of different levels of gene expression. The differentially expressed genes are linked to the biological process which in turn helps us understand the molecular mechanism behind the metabolic reprogramming caused by altered PI3-kinase enzyme.

f8cd259fecb7becfef83fa65daf6db20e402226f,Genome-wide analysis of survival in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.,"PURPOSE
Lung cancer, of which 85% is non-small-cell (NSCLC), is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. We used genome-wide analysis of tumor tissue to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in tumors are prognostic factors in early-stage NSCLC.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred early-stage NSCLC patients from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) were used as a discovery set and 89 NSCLC patients collected by the National Institute of Occupational Health, Norway, were used as a validation set. DNA was extracted from flash-frozen lung tissue with at least 70% tumor cellularity. Genome-wide genotyping was done using the high-density SNP chip. Copy numbers were inferred using median smoothing after intensity normalization. Cox models were used to screen and validate significant SNPs associated with the overall survival.


RESULTS
Copy number gains in chromosomes 3q, 5p, and 8q were observed in both MGH and Norwegian cohorts. The top 50 SNPs associated with overall survival in the MGH cohort (P < or = 2.5 x 10(-4)) were selected and examined using the Norwegian cohort. Five of the top 50 SNPs were validated in the Norwegian cohort with false discovery rate lower than 0.05 (P < .016) and all five were located in known genes: STK39, PCDH7, A2BP1, and EYA2. The numbers of risk alleles of the five SNPs showed a cumulative effect on overall survival (P(trend) = 3.80 x 10(-12) and 2.48 x 10(-7) for MGH and Norwegian cohorts, respectively).


CONCLUSION
Five SNPs were identified that may be prognostic of overall survival in early-stage NSCLC.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yen-Tsung Huang"", ids = ""2649637""); list(name = ""Rebecca Suk Heist"", ids = ""123862871""); list(name = ""Lucian R Chirieac"", ids = ""6510669""); list(name = ""Xihong Lin"", ids = ""144361840""); list(name = ""Vidar Skaug"", ids = ""5868072""); list(name = ""Shanbeh Zienolddiny"", ids = ""6811632""); list(name = ""Aage Haugen"", ids = ""81920795""); list(name = ""Michael C Wu"", ids = ""145383549""); list(name = ""Zhaoxi Wang"", ids = ""47196834""); list(name = ""Li Su"", ids = ""145235478""); list(name = ""Kofi Asomaning"", ids = ""5954127""); list(name = ""David C.

c6bf9cdab9dba485e19e6023c35caf723db2351a,Unique genome-wide transcriptome profiles of chicken macrophages exposed to Salmonella-derived endotoxin,"BackgroundMacrophages play essential roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Bacteria require endotoxin, a complex lipopolysaccharide, for outer membrane permeability and the host interprets endotoxin as a signal to initiate an innate immune response. The focus of this study is kinetic and global transcriptional analysis of the chicken macrophage response to in vitro stimulation with endotoxin from Salmonellatyphimurium-798.ResultsThe 38535-probeset Affymetrix GeneChip Chicken Genome array was used to profile transcriptional response to endotoxin 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours post stimulation (hps). Using a maximum FDR (False Discovery Rate) of 0.05 to declare genes as differentially expressed (DE), we found 13, 33, 1761 and 61 DE genes between endotoxin-stimulated versus non-stimulated cells at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hps, respectively. QPCR demonstrated that endotoxin exposure significantly affected the mRNA expression of IL1B, IL6, IL8, and TLR15, but not IL10 and IFNG in HD 11 cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that 10% of the total DE genes were involved in inflammatory response. Three, 9.7, 96.8, and 11.8% of the total DE inflammatory response genes were significantly differentially expressed with endotoxin stimulation at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hps, respectively. The NFKBIA, IL1B, IL8 and CCL4 genes were consistently induced at all times after endotoxin treatment. NLRC5 (CARD domain containing, NOD-like receptor family, RCJMB04_18i2), an intracellular receptor, was induced in HD11 cells treated with endotoxin.ConclusionsAs above using an in vitro model of chicken response to endotoxin, our data revealed the kinetics of gene networks involved in host response to endotoxin and extend the known complexity of networks in chicken immune response to Gram-negative bacteria such as Salmonella. The induction of NFKBIA, IL1B, IL8, CCL4 genes is a consistent signature of host response to endotoxin over time.

7d36c9535b7364b373dd9c52af9ea8cd34b4617d,88 Changing Maternal Nutrition in Early Pregnancy Modifies Fetal Ovary Development in Nellore Cows,"Environmental influences such as nutritional restriction during early gestation in cattle may impair fetal development and compromise functions in adulthood. During the first trimester of gestation fetal gonads are formed. We hypothesised that either restriction or excess of nutrients ingested by cows during the first third of pregnancy interferes with fetal body weight (BW) and ovary development. Twenty-one uniparous Nelore cows (BWâ€‰=â€‰488â€‰Â±â€‰24â€‰kg, body condition score, BCSâ€‰=â€‰3.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.1) were subjected to timed AI with sexed semen (female) of a single bull and individually allocated to different diets. The diet of the control group (C) met the maintenance requirements, and the groups of high (A) and low (B) were either 180% or 60% of maintenance respectively. Live weight and BCS were assessed weekly to adjust the diet according to the individual weight of each animal. At 60 days of gestation, 9 fetuses (3/group) were removed by colpotomy (accessed through vagina), weighed, and their ovaries were dissected and weighed. One fetal ovary (of each pair) was analysed by RNA-seq (mRNA). The effects of treatments on both ovarian and fetal weight were compared by ANOVA (proc GLM, SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). During the 60 days of treatment, cows from Group A gained 66â€‰kg (from 474â€‰Â±â€‰6â€‰kg to 541â€‰Â±â€‰10â€‰kg) and 1.25 points in BCS (from 3.0 to 4.25), whereas the cows in group B lost 61â€‰kg (from 458â€‰Â±â€‰3â€‰kg to 397â€‰Â±â€‰6â€‰kg) and 1 point in BCS (from 3.2 to 2.2). Fetal ovary weight (sum of the two) was lower in group B (0.007â€‰Â±â€‰0.001â€‰g; Pâ€‰ â€‰0.08) between each other. Fetuses in group B weighed less (12.8â€‰Â±â€‰1.14â€‰g; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.006) than in groups A (20.56â€‰Â±â€‰2.2â€‰g) and C (20.03â€‰Â±â€‰0.8â€‰g). Maternal nutritional status during the first 60 days of gestation changed the transcriptome of fetal ovaries. There were differences in the pattern of gene expression between the control, high, and low intake groups. A total of 79 genes out of 20â€‰657 showed differential expression between treatments (false discovery rate 0.05), some of which were related to embryonic and ovarian development. Thus, we conclude that changing maternal nutrition during the first 60 days of gestation will change the transcriptomic profile of fetal ovaries. Poor maternal nutrition jeopardizes ovarian size and weight and fetal weight, suggesting impairment on the production of ovarian follicles. This is a critical period in fetal ovarian development, as oocytes grow and differentiate, and need to escape from degenerative processes to remain in the ovaries. Thus, the developmental impairment at the beginning of meiosis could reduce the number of oocytes in the fetal ovary. Histological examination of fetal ovaries is underway to evaluate the number of oocytes.

10a3e3d50188417b6d1b8727dd8a67edf80802be,In silico replication of the genome-wide association results of the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium.,"Recently, the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) reported 22 novel type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated loci identified by meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with a case-control design. However, the association of 10 of these 22 reported loci was not confirmed in the T1DGC family cohort (P > 0.1). To address concerns about potential bias from population stratification, this study aims to replicate the association in three independent GWAS cohorts, one of which was based on the stratification-proof transmission disequilibrium analysis. Three European-descent population samples were included in this study: 483 cases and both parents, a case-control cohort of 514 cases and 2027 controls, and an additional cohort of 1078 cases and 341 controls from the dbGaP database. Among the 22 SNPs reported by the T1DGC, we had high-quality genotypes for 15; the remaining were imputed. T1D association was replicated in seven loci after Bonferroni correction for 22 independent hypotheses. An additional eight loci had nominal (one-sided) significance of P < 0.1 in the same direction, giving a false discovery rate of 3.35%. The genetic susceptibility conferred by non-HLA loci in our family cohort with one affected offspring was higher than the T1DGC multiplex families. Reciprocally, the frequency of strongly predisposing HLA alleles in the multiplex families was higher. This study replicated T1D association with at least as many of these novel loci as expected from the power of our sample size, thus supporting the validity of the new discoveries.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hui-Qi Qu"", ids = ""87079057""); list(name = ""Jonathan P.

Qlucore Omics Explorer was used for statistical analysis and to derive different protein signatures between groups. Results: A significantly different exosomal protein signature was found in the HTx group compared to the HF group and controls (Figure 1). In particular, complement factor proteins were significantly increased in the serum exosomes of HTx patients compared to control (CO4A, p= 0.027; CO5, p= 0.019) and compared to HF (CO4A, p= 0.002; C1S, p= 0.013). Conclusion: These data suggest a distinct exosomal proteome signature in HTx recipients compared to controls and HF patients, mainly involving proteins related to complement system activation and structural proteins. Despite histopathological examination shows no signs of rejection, exosomal complement factor content is significantly altered in the HTx group. Further analysis will assess differences in patients with acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection following HTx.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Annika Ingvarsson"", ids = ""15987497""); list(name = ""Anna Werther Evaldsson"", ids = ""74945672""); list(name = ""GÃ¶ran RÃ¥degran"", ids = ""6416982""); list(name = ""Johan E.P.

27cd58806e5c44aebe1d576b8ec730ba45448159,DNA methylation and smoking in Korean adults: epigenome-wide association study,"BackgroundExposure to cigarette smoking can increase the risk of cancers and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of how smoking contributes to disease risks are not completely understood. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs), mostly in non-Asian populations, have been conducted to identify smoking-associated methylation alterations at individual probes. There are few data on regional methylation changes in relation to smoking. Few data link differential methylation in blood to differential gene expression in lung tissue.ResultsWe identified 108 significant (false discovery rate (FDR) <â€‰0.05) differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and 87 significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (multiple-testing corrected pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) in current compared to never smokers from our EWAS of cotinine-validated smoking in blood DNA from a Korean chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰100 including 31 current, 30 former, and 39 never smokers) using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Of the 108 DMPs (FDR <â€‰0.05), nine CpGs were statistically significant based on Bonferroni correction and 93 were novel including five that mapped to loci previously associated with smoking. Of the 87 DMRs, 66 were mapped to novel loci. Methylation correlated with urine cotinine levels in current smokers at six DMPs, with pack-years in current smokers at six DMPs, and with duration of smoking cessation in former smokers at eight DMPs. Of the 143 genes to which our significant DMPs or DMRs annotated, gene expression levels at 20 genes were associated with pack-years in lung tissue transcriptome data of smokers (Asan Biobank, nâ€‰=â€‰188).ConclusionsOur study of differential methylation in Koreans confirmed previous findings from non-Asian populations and revealed novel loci in relation to smoking. Smoking-related differential methylation in blood is associated with gene expression in lung tissue, an important target of adverse health effects of smoking, supporting the potential functional importance of methylation in smoking-related disease.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mi Kyeong Lee"", ids = ""145368971""); list(name = ""Yoonki Hong"", ids = ""4722945""); list(name = ""Sun-Young Kim"", ids = ""3752266""); list(name = ""Stephanie J London"", ids = ""4166450""); list(name = ""Woo Jin Kim"", ids = ""1767101"")",d160ab88894f574420aafe0ad93e56318a01e313; 1d2a06d34c1ae369008931acca5000233e246011; e06c68b53e7d5a73bfa33da1a7561a0e8ccacb7d; 3f731fc5fdbef4893510a1a2c0f6e62d30fb3de6; 3f7651a44fbd220d7417b385f2e5cb6a77851cb5; 546136e34979fc107b4bf0fce9065e4ee4ac253d; ad259d28b92f23983b8781fe261c1fa23dc09982; ad3226063125b50b8330358265389ebee02aeec4; 227732714d0ce7410dbf6f5d93618f9c3e25ca10; 0a90c820d832e06220d5497c5cfa71fba5c4d28a; a515fb1924f118db6056fa133e9a12a34f23290d; 6efc0f13dfce4dea38b2e7e2128f0176909dc750; e6761c5f2a5a9fc11926784a657ce54874de93f2; 137670b4cf50313064dd81e0e541b40aa0738b04; 75c7a5aff589d16bd98d596aca90313ddbef1d17; 1b8d6cb2b55e1e496c5daefa31a041dd03b5b6c3; a35d57e71b6617ec0d1c073804ea1e8922a3d7ee; f81075ad55a17bb85320ab3505f1d149c3ba5f97; 03b1d704fab5fe2fd00243e1ff49d694120e1e4c; 28dbe24a18f48d7f1885e5b989800b90304431ba; 95b303107f387e388a296a3a1248f3e2891a7cc3; 603c6c70b534877756f258985aa719abb3f7a379,f15b79e765325f72a4155108a14747e0d26d82b5; f1bcbe5845406cf32742e8d2219498c23337f9a5; 133e717ed89d1a4ed33c5481dea6e411d46e8b75; db93aa9148327876cf38648e3f4a31af00b0b528; 2cd564bad36a42a55cc1f8a487479164849a9c5e; a8871b38f7e4b5715b572f36b393b21539a6a082; ba29358ed8742477bc1d808b15db1651b7e7a0a8; 663be5100986a0cee5ec84ed0e923f3262d1bb6b; 81e690f22d65b24f86fa70881374366c3d80ca1f; dabde07a289861e411609a1859feb4b7e18b9633; 4d7b8b0f319e5f92b196d1cbf80149a535db2c03; b5d4cf9f05567e9dc9f26fd7d4f070d16ed3661f; 96b4d113ce2917a6ba0e879df36fbb57077d3a24; b6ede4c1309eb4d28af8f82b49d44d1f51f28a95; cf137fa02ef67ea30801c8a7aa91714cbe0b5eec; 2113346aadcb985cd7bc5866d7e3935f6a0a4782; 2f914d785b4de0d050dc7c5a64869833ec2d51b1; 57781c18d696f98a4eb33c59094787c299381c5f; f14b49d2b8459ad9861d1bd0b52260513a7e446f; 659408b243cec55de8d0a3bc51b81173007aa89b; 0bc78e080e63ce051e8e19b67839dfc58011ecf8; cb813dfc48247d0b65f1cb1084a5b4bccf6f3de8; abb43ccc6e21697e4c0ca3dedc8366378af6ecc0; c9d4c5b6c8959d6413832189940d7b32c641d39d; f8c9f3e95d362ca9a7e762a59daecbf8320fb001; 7aa68708afb5037b70e0fdb7a903c9fb5d7d7053; 8d87704ab4bb376b3f4c2dec33cab81948127306; 6725c0321c848b7678daaf738e9bb2e9dfb65dfa; 1467a4368f41aaa43fc65b4182e48d9588ed17eb; 362fecb223d8b2501a7dacae7abffaa45f40bb54; de97265c2425bf2e32c0e81c62fa6a25c711c423; c770350c9e93195b2ff94a3b0303a4cc6076dfb1; 2bbd98012f6aee6dcd6fcdb00375334a33d1bc87; 0157699e0335b7a3bbba1fae2226ea773475b405; 19764514ae396fdcc8ac9333a8feb750bcb3d429; af4b3d01c44d7a404f64aa6b8da49cdbc8cb0759; 0902d22ebb030a389e9dac4faed310075ad97216; 3bac27f0a2d271e2d5bcd91d39342fdaaef8a456; 26c74eba7ac84a24c375e3e0d35377ab5b03cc71; 059eb3da5c1849149c1405e906cfb7aba4689f0b; fec5682fc6dab1e470d582e8622b9a3b342ded5e; 4ad1063c3c1c665aab2bf1b4f8a505ee1cde846c; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; c1a495f0e7c804f49cff23faded60943c5761896; 5c14f2d1a20750f6ef29d88989a0f707b87ed1ec; f1b152ac695e7adfef7903ea8a19a793cc17803a; e15fcd9bc6b57ba53adfb5bd0d06dda7d1f9f510; 0abdaba4b960c0583eef21c939cbf9983ef8e177; 2d34348551b57881bbd700ebc4f81bea1b8bd3ee; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 83ad2bcf30e4b03006b3c54c111657326613e78a; 70b9bf686eeb88c446e4ea7e772e5935ac888639; e71f1c7012a7605ab8fafe4d2520c8d9f63376e3; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72; 30fdefc9f8984b37c54b62ecd8318226c482379e; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083,Clinical Epigenetics,8,
b3c5662ab5dd5c92ed883e69a86abec7eba37b85,FOXM1 Is Associated with Development of Therapeutic Resistance in Multiple Myeloma,"Despite advances in treatment resulting from development of novel therapies, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease because of the emergence of therapeutic resistance. To explore mechanisms of acquired resistance to the IMiDÂ® immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide in patients with MM, we performed RNA-seq analysis on 12 paired newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patient samples of sorted CD138+ cells obtained prior to lenalidomide treatment initiation and after development of resistance. Gene set enrichment analysis using gene ontology biological process categories indicated that a dominant process associated with proliferation was upregulated at relapse. Transcription factor target enrichment analysis revealed that among differentially expressed genes, targets of forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), a transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation, were significantly (â‰ˆ 50% of FOXM1 target genes, false discovery rate [FDR] Disclosures Amatangelo: Celgene Corporation: Employment.

563cc42db6c36b113a2800dd111d9827bbea070a,Multitrait meta-analysis identified genomic regions associated with sexual precocity in tropical beef cattle.,"Multitrait meta-analyses are a strategy to produce more accurate genome-wide association studies, especially for complex phenotypes. We carried out a meta-analysis study for traits related to sexual precocity in tropical beef cattle (Nellore and Brahman) aiming to identify important genomic regions affecting these traits. The traits included in the analyses were age at first calving (AFC), early pregnancy (EP), age at first corpus luteum (AGECL), first postpartum anoestrus interval (PPAI), and scrotal circumference (SC). The traits AFC, EP, and SCN were measured in Nellore cattle, while AGECL, PPAI, and SCB were measured in Brahman cattle. Meta-analysis resulted in 108 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), at an empirical threshold P-value of 1.39 Ã— 10-5 (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). Within 0.5 Mb of the significant SNP, candidate genes were annotated and analyzed for functional enrichment. Most of the closest genes to the SNP with higher significance in each chromosome have been associated with important roles in reproductive function. They are TSC22D2, KLF7, ARHGAP29, 7SK, MAP3K5, TLE3, WDR5, TAF3, TMEM68, PPP1R15B, NR2F2, GALR1, SUFU, and KCNU1. We did not observe any significant SNP in BTA5, BTA12, BTA17, BTA18, BTA19, BTA20, BTA22, BTA23, BTA25, and BTA28. Although the majority of significant SNPs are in BTA14, it was identified significant associations in multiple chromosomes (19 out of 29 autosomes), which is consistent with the postulation that reproductive traits are complex polygenic phenotypes. Five proposed association regions harbor the majority of the significant SNP (76%) and were distributed over four chromosomes (P < 1.39 Ã— 10-5, FDR < 0.05): BTA2 (5.55%) from 95 to 96 Mb, BTA4 (5.55%) from 94.1 to 94.8 Mb, BTA14 (59.26%) from 24 to 25 Mb and 29 to 30 Mb, and BTA21 (5.55%) from 6.7 Mb to 11.4 Mb. These regions harbored key genes related to reproductive function. Moreover, these genes were enriched for functional groups associated with immune response, maternal-fetal tolerance, pregnancy maintenance, embryo development, fertility, and response to stress. Further studies including other breeds and precocity traits could confirm the importance of these regions and identify new candidate regions for sexual precocity in beef cattle.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thaise Pinto de Melo"", ids = ""23202530""); list(name = ""Marina Rufino Salinas Fortes"", ids = ""5993421""); list(name = ""Tiago Bresolin"", ids = ""40001450""); list(name = ""L F M Mota"", ids = ""51066573""); list(name = ""LÃºcia GalvÃ£o de Albuquerque"", ids = ""144199221""); list(name = ""Roberto Carvalheiro"", ids = ""2819532"")",fa0e14fca2adca52aa80dc4e7dd84868f0b54164,,Journal of animal science,96 10,"

7193304cb85d452b8e86b10d015555e327cfa708,Mantle cell lymphoma: transcriptional regulation by microRNAs,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) pathogenesis is still partially unexplained. We investigate the importance of microRNA (miRNA) expression as an additional feature that influences MCL pathway deregulation and may be useful for predicting patient outcome. Twenty-three MCL samples, eight cell lines and appropriate controls were screened for their miRNAs and gene expression profiles and DNA copy-number changes. MCL patients exhibit a characteristic signature that includes 117 miRNA (false discovery rate <0.05). Combined analysis of miRNAs and the gene expression profile, paired with bioinformatics target prediction (miRBase and TargetScan), revealed a series of genes and pathways potentially targeted by a small number of miRNAs, including essential pathways for lymphoma survival such as CD40, mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-ÎºB. Functional validation in MCL cell lines demonstrated NF-ÎºB subunit nuclear translocation to be regulated by the expression of miR-26a. The expression of 12 selected miRNAs was studied by quantitative PCR in an additional series of 54 MCL cases. Univariate analysis identified a single miRNA, miR-20b, whose lack of expression distinguished cases with a survival probability of 56% at 60 months. In summary, using a novel bioinformatics approach, this study identified miRNA changes that contribute to MCL pathogenesis and markers of potential utility in MCL diagnosis and clinical prognostication.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lorena Di Lisio"", ids = ""7471557""); list(name = ""Gonzalo GÃ³mez-LÃ³pez"", ids = ""1398287583""); list(name = ""Margarita SÃ¡nchez-Beato"", ids = ""1401298908""); list(name = ""Cristina GÃ³mez-Abad"", ids = ""1401298849""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Elena LeÃ³n RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""150229705""); list(name = ""Raquel Villuendas"", ids = ""6993241""); list(name = ""Bibiana I.

f90688b19b38c8786effe29e2386843456160a12,Gray and white matter water diffusion in the syndromic variants of frontotemporal dementia,"Objective:To use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess gray matter and white matter tract diffusion in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SMD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Methods:This was a case-control study where 16 subjects with bvFTD, 7 with PNFA, and 4 with SMD were identified and matched by age and gender to 19 controls. All subjects had 3-T head MRI with a DTI sequence with diffusion encoding in 21 directions. Gray matter mean diffusivity (MD) was assessed using a region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-level approach, and voxel-based morphometry was used to assess patterns of gray matter loss. White matter tract diffusivity (fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity) was assessed by placing ROIs on tracts of interest. Results:In bvFTD, increased gray matter MD and gray matter loss were identified bilaterally throughout frontal and temporal lobes, with abnormal diffusivity observed in white matter tracts that connect to these regions. In SMD, gray matter loss and increased MD were identified predominantly in the left temporal lobe, with tract abnormalities observed in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus. In PNFA, gray matter loss and increased MD were observed in left inferior frontal lobe, insula, and supplemental motor area, with tract abnormalities observed in the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Conclusions:The diffusivity of gray matter is increased in regions that are atrophic in frontotemporal dementia, suggesting disruption of the cytoarchitecture of remaining tissue. Furthermore, damage was identified in white matter tracts that interconnect these regions, supporting the hypothesis that these diseases involve different and specific brain networks.

fb8235ca4650a2649676dfecdfbc4fd5af432517,P3-17-02: Targeting the Autophagy Pathway for Drug Resistance of Breast Tumor-Initiating Cells.,"Background: Our clinical data and experimental evidence reveal that the tumor-initiating cells (TICs) in the original tumor are intrinsically resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy and greatly enriched in residual breast cancers after such treatments. We have published a gene expression signature of such breast TICs, and our pathway analysis on the gene signature suggests that the activation of autophagy pathway may be an intrinsic characteristic of the TICs. This motivates us to further investigate the role of the autophagy pathway in TICs self-maintenance and their resistance to hormonal and chemo therapies, as well as their response to TIC-targeted therapies. Methods: A collective 84 well-documented autophagy pathway genes were used to compare the activation of autophagy pathway in different microarray datasets, 1) flow-sorted CD44 + /CD24 âˆ’/low cancer cells vs. all other cells (representing 20 patients), and cancer-derived MSs vs. corresponding primary bulk tumors (representing 17 patients), 2) before vs. after letrozole and doxetaxel treatments (representing 30 patient pairs), 3) before vs. after letrozole treatment (representing 176 patient pairs), and 4) before vs. after lapatinib treatment (representing 115 patient pairs). We applied the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm to analyze the expression data of 211 normalized probes for the 84 genes. Low-density RTPCR array for the 84 genes was used to confirm the differential expressed genes on tumor tissues of 18 letrozol treated patient pairs. Two human-cancer-in-mouse triple-negative xenograft tumor lines were treated with Notch pathway inhibitor alone or in combining with docetaxel. The tumor growth, mammosphere formation efficiency, and the expression of autophagy marker proteins were evaluated. Results: Overall, the enrichment analysis of the 84-gene set in all the above microarray datasets showed that the autophagy genes are significantly enriched in the differential expressed genes. In particular, 28 out of the 84 autophagy genes are significantly up-regulated in the TICs populations while 5 other autophagy genes are down-regulated with the false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05. For the letrozole and doxetaxel treatment microarray analysis, 34 out of the 84 autophagy genes are significantly up-regulated in the after-treatment group (p Conclusion: Activation of the autophagy pathway in TICs is a promising target to combat the drug resistance of breast cancer to conventional systemic therapy.

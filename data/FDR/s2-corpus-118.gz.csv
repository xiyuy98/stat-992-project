501775ea3c653eb70661e4f60972019701200ec4,Measuring affective sharing between two people from simultaneously recorded EEG signals,"Empathy has been studied intensively in the field of human-machine interaction and human-human interaction. In many of these studies, empathy is subjectively measured by questionnaire. We propose a method to directly measure human empathy from neural potential activity. In this research, EEG signals were recorded simultaneously from two subjects engaged in emotional communication. After time frequency analysis was performed on the recorded Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a cross correlation functions between EEG signals of two subjects were calculated. To investigate the significance of cross correlations, paired t-test and false discovery rate correction were performed. As a result, there was a significant cross correlation in the gamma frequency band in the joy condition. In addition, there was a marginally significant correlation in the sadness condition. From these results we showed the possibility to measure empathy from cross correlation of EEG signals recorded from two subjects.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Taiki Kinoshita"", ids = ""35521380"")",,8e218630f62acb0178a250aa16aa3b33593d9e72; 4187ef89f3e4318f1ad721be4c1b26ab36be606c; 66ec476b300f421b5f6068443ba350ed683c30bc; 9576d1573688a05e45ad30e783e7d0c10a10d6d9; c717eb4e913c3249eac18d0fba13a1aa02d60dad; 725885f73a1f1dd19ba3167add18211806c047c4; 284636fc53503d4fb192b77e941dc1edf9359789; 2154255e3f7d42687c71fcb94b66c5efa5516483; 76ad159a2887b008e5a7335d124c148c13e65465,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the serum proteins biomarkers by label-free liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry quantification methods in the Chinese patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).


METHOD
In the study period, sera from 40 AIS patients and 40 normal cases were selected for screening study. The selected protein associations with disease risk were further evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing of the remaining stroke cases and controls. Its value for biomarkers diagnosis was appreciated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.


RESULTS
Patients versus control levels differences were suggested for 19 proteins (nominal PÂ <Â 0.05) for stroke, with three proteins having a false discovery rate <0.05. The association of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) with stroke (PÂ <Â 0.001) was confirmed using ELISA in replication studies. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal serum concentration of MBL as a surrogate marker to support the diagnosis of ischemic cerebral injury was found to be 1050Â ug/L, which yielded a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 80.2%, the area under the curve was 0.812 (95% CI: 0.724-0.876). In multivariate analysis, there was an increased risk of AIS associated with MBL levels â‰¥1050Â ug/L (OR: 4.76, 95% CI: 1.59-10.12) after adjusting for possible confounders.


CONCLUSION
The discovery and replication studies presented here show MBL to be a risk marker for AIS in the Chinese population, which appears to be a novel finding.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xue-jun Wei"", ids = ""5170543""); list(name = ""Feng Li"", ids = ""46494079""); list(name = ""Feng-Yong Yang"", ids = ""7468244""); list(name = ""Chong-hao Duan"", ids = ""3551172"")",,,The International journal of neuroscience,126 8,"

eb746b21e0075f9ef7181b69d7ebf07d42b9c4f3,"A two-step hierarchical hypothesis set testing framework, with applications to gene expression data on ordered categories","BackgroundIn complex large-scale experiments, in addition to simultaneously considering a large number of features, multiple hypotheses are often being tested for each feature. This leads to a problem of multi-dimensional multiple testing. For example, in gene expression studies over ordered categories (such as time-course or dose-response experiments), interest is often in testing differential expression across several categories for each gene. In this paper, we consider a framework for testing multiple sets of hypothesis, which can be applied to a wide range of problems.ResultsWe adopt the concept of the overall false discovery rate (OFDR) for controlling false discoveries on the hypothesis set level. Based on an existing procedure for identifying differentially expressed gene sets, we discuss a general two-step hierarchical hypothesis set testing procedure, which controls the overall false discovery rate under independence across hypothesis sets. In addition, we discuss the concept of the mixed-directional false discovery rate (mdFDR), and extend the general procedure to enable directional decisions for two-sided alternatives. We applied the framework to the case of microarray time-course/dose-response experiments, and proposed three procedures for testing differential expression and making multiple directional decisions for each gene. Simulation studies confirm the control of the OFDR and mdFDR by the proposed procedures under independence and positive correlations across genes. Simulation results also show that two of our new procedures achieve higher power than previous methods. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a microarray dose-response study, to identify 17 Î²-estradiol sensitive genes in breast cancer cells that are induced at low concentrations.ConclusionsThe framework we discuss provides a platform for multiple testing procedures covering situations involving two (or potentially more) sources of multiplicity. The framework is easy to use and adaptable to various practical settings that frequently occur in large-scale experiments. Procedures generated from the framework are shown to maintain control of the OFDR and mdFDR, quantities that are especially relevant in the case of multiple hypothesis set testing. The procedures work well in both simulations and real datasets, and are shown to have better power than existing methods.",2013,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Y Irina Li"", ids = ""39302778""); list(name = ""Debashis Ghosh"", ids = ""145165051"")",c117971e646e96ba2577f8a7f39246f021e08544; a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c; ace745ec27b3fee7b107654de6f6695e30ebb76b; efd61e2ae0c79eb21cf44d2b9c6b460604c51f83; 3582bea873386a0c74366055fb35615cf0f42d69; c93060355830534d0c146fbd3005e7391406aaad,b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 0f7a0a17c58de40e6b9065410a6ff018fde52246; a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; 6b6a69c49f24a25c9eb3288f0c4f5b5adab068a1; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f8fdba9c7e718793981f32d0fc298a2702f1ede7; 3fec56c823eaf62632a6501acb003f5ffa0751ec,BMC Bioinformatics,15,108 - 108

eaae6c8f79c0217d97107a671be0e66dbe845fb0,OP0213 Systemic Sclerosis is Associated with a Unique Colonic Microbial Consortium,"Background Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) dysfunction affects most patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is a leading cause of morbidity. While the etiology of SSc-related lower GIT dysfunction remains elusive, evidence suggests that bacterial overgrowth is a feature of SSc. However, no studies have directly examined the colonic microbial consortium of SSc patients. Objectives To compare colonic microbial composition of SSc patients and healthy controls. To determine whether microbial composition alterations are associated with lower GIT symptoms. Methods Adults SSc patients who had no contraindication to colonoscopy were eligible to participate. Patients were excluded if they were on chronic antibiotic therapy. Healthy controls were age- and gender-matched to SSc patients (1:1). At baseline, participants underwent a colonoscopy and cecum and sigmoid mucosal lavage samples were obtained. Patients also completed the GIT 2.0 questionnaire to assess GIT symptom severity at the time of colonoscopy. The microbiota from these samples were determined by Illumina HiSeq 2000 16S sequencing, and operational taxonomic units (OTU) were selected using the Greengenes database at 97% identity. Similarity between microbial communities in sample groups were determined by computing unweighted UniFrac distances between samples with QIIME. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed to visualize the resulting UniFrac distance matrix. To identify differentially abundant bacterial phylotypes at the genus-taxonomy level, pairwise comparisons (Kruskal-Wallis test) between SSc and healthy samples were computed. Multiple hypothesis tests were adjusted by computing Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rates (FDR) and a significant association was defined at the FDR q-value threshold below 0.05. Results 17 patients with SSc (88% Female; Median age 52.1 years; Median disease duration 7.1 years) underwent colonoscopy. The mean (SD) GIT 2.0 scores were: Total: 0.7 (0.6); Distension/Bloating: 1.5 (0.9); Fecal soilage 0.5 (0.9); Diarrhea 0.4 (0.6); Social functioning 0.5 (0.5); Emotional Well-being 0.5 (0.7); Constipation 0.7 (0.7). PCoA illustrated significant differences in the microbial communities in SSc versus healthy controls in both the cecum (R2=0.9, p=0.001) and sigmoid (R2=0.9, p=0.002) (Figure 1). Pairwise comparisons between SSc and healthy samples demonstrated numerous significant differences in bacterial genera of the cecum and sigmoid. Similar to chronic inflammatory states, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), SSc patients had decreased commensal genera, such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium , and increased pathogenic genera, such as Enterobacteriales and Fusobacterium , compared with healthy controls in the cecum and sigmoid. However, SSc patients had increased sigmoid and cecum Bifidobacterium , which is typically found in lower abundance in IBD. Additional taxa alterations were observed, and the relationship between the microbial consortium and GIT symptoms was also explored and will be presented. Conclusions This study demonstrates a distinct microbial signature in the colon of SSc patients compared with healthy controls. This unique ecological change may perpetuate immunological aberrations and contribute to clinical manifestations of SSc.

ad4f861d385726ef566cbbd1581599358f8e94db,Mixture Models for Detecting Differentially Expressed Genes in Microarrays,"An important and common problem in microarray experiments is the detection of genes that are differentially expressed in a given number of classes. As this problem concerns the selection of significant genes from a large pool of candidate genes, it needs to be carried out within the framework of multiple hypothesis testing. In this paper, we focus on the use of mixture models to handle the multiplicity issue. With this approach, a measure of the local FDR (false discovery rate) is provided for each gene. An attractive feature of the mixture model approach is that it provides a framework for the estimation of the prior probability that a gene is not differentially expressed, and this probability can subsequently be used in forming a decision rule. The rule can also be formed to take the false negative rate into account. We apply this approach to a well-known publicly available data set on breast cancer, and discuss our findings with reference to other approaches.",2006,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Liat Ben-Tovim Jones"", ids = ""2006284""); list(name = ""Richard Bean"", ids = ""144125771""); list(name = ""Geoffrey J.

4c442c585634be71fccd6c54193a0c184a0a5b7b,Extreme Value Analysis of Huge Datasets Tail Estimation Methods in High-Throughput Screening and Bioinformatics,"This thesis presents results in Extreme Value Theory with applications to High-Throughput Screening and Bioinformatics. The methods described here, however, are applicable to statistical analysis of huge datasets in general. The main results are covered in four papers. The first paper develops novel methods to handle false rejections in High-Throughput Screening experiments where testing is done at extreme significance levels, with low degrees of freedom, and when the true null distribution may differ from the theoretical one. We introduce efficient and accurate estimators of False Discovery Rate and related quantities, and provide methods of estimation of the true null distribution resulting from data preprocessing, as well as techniques to compare it with the theoretical null distribution. Extreme Value Statistics provides a natural analysis tool: a simple polynomial model for the tail of the distribution of p-values. We exhibit the properties of the estimators of the parameters of the model, and point to model checking tools, both for independent and dependent data. The methods are tried out on two large scale genomic studies and on an fMRI brain scan experiment. The second paper gives a strict mathematical basis for the above methods. We present asymptotic formulas for the distribution tails of probably the most commonly used statistical tests under non-normality, dependence, and non-homogeneity, and derive bounds on the absolute and relative errors of the approximations.

723029b2e0a05815c7eafb1179a26254cf7af8f2,Can Occipital Alpha Neurofeedback Influence LTRCs and Deterministic ERPs without Critical Branching,"Critical branching is a theoretical interaction in-between simple units, such as neuronal elements of the human brain. Zhigalov, Kaplan, and Palva (2016, Clin. Neurophysiol., 127(8), 2882-2889) revealed that neurofeedback flash stimulation locked to the phase of high-amplitude occipital alpha influences stimulus-locked occipital averages in the alpha-band. This feedback also influences the power scaling of long-range temporal correlations in alpha-band amplitude fluctuations. Seemingly, neurofeedback influences critical branching alongside there being an interaction between ongoing neuronal activity and evoked responses. However, the causal relations between these neuronal long-range temporal correlations, sustained attention, and any avalanche dynamics are called into question. Further, uncorrected concerns include false discovery rate and an objective mathematical error in the precedent (Palva et al., 2013, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110(9), 3585-3590). An alternative set of illustrative mathematical principles offers a preliminary fit to the effects in the data. That is, neurofeedback influences the deterministic contribution to the single-trial event-related potentials, which each flash evokes, separately from the oscillatory alpha gain that those flashes cause. Accordingly, distinct principles of this neurofeedback-related exponential occipital oscillatory alpha gain and deterministic event-related potential generation produce micro-behaviours with macroscale consequences: neurofeedback causally influences power-scaling of long-range temporal correlations without critical branching.",2016,Mathematics; Biology; Physics,"list(name = ""Tom A.

6e6bab924acaf01386fd30eb0a591275983c9907,Peripheral arterial occlusive disease: Global gene expression analyses suggest a major role for immune and inflammatory responses,"BackgroundPeripheral arterial disease (PAD), a major manifestation of atherosclerosis, is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity, limb loss and death. However, mechanisms underlying the genesis and progression of the disease are far from clear. Genome-wide gene expression profiling of clinical samples may represent an effective approach to gain relevant information.ResultsAfter histological classification, a total of 30 femoral artery samples, including 11 intermediate lesions, 14 advanced lesions and 5 normal femoral arteries, were profiled using Affymetrix microarray platform. Following real-time RT-PCR validation, different algorithms of gene selection and clustering were applied to identify differentially expressed genes. Under a stringent cutoff, i.e., a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.5%, we found 366 genes were differentially regulated in intermediate lesions and 447 in advanced lesions. Of these, 116 genes were overlapped between intermediate and advanced lesions, including 68 up-regulated genes and 48 down-regulated ones. In these differentially regulated genes, immune/inflammatory genes were significantly up-regulated in different stages of PAD, (85/230 in intermediate lesions, 37/172 in advanced lesions). Through literature mining and pathway analysis using different databases such as Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomics (KEGG), genes involved in immune/inflammatory responses were significantly enriched in up-regulated genes at different stages of PAD(p < 0.05), revealing a significant correlation between immune/inflammatory responses and disease progression. Moreover, immune-related pathways such as Toll-like receptor signaling and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity were particularly enriched in intermediate and advanced lesions (P < 0.05), highlighting their pathogenic significance during disease progression.ConclusionLines of evidence revealed in this study not only support previous hypotheses, primarily based on studies of animal models and other types of arterial disease, that inflammatory responses may influence the development of PAD, but also permit the recognition of a wide spectrum of immune/inflammatory genes that can serve as signatures for disease progression in PAD. Further studies of these signature molecules may eventually allow us to develop more sophisticated protocols for pharmaceutical interventions.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shijun Fu"", ids = ""36153451""); list(name = ""Haiguang Zhao"", ids = ""46430975""); list(name = ""Jiantao Shi"", ids = ""51000144""); list(name = ""Arhat Abzhanov"", ids = ""2190984""); list(name = ""Keith D.

4dbfbb2d818780836bce089f7bba6155ece664f9,Impact of nose-only exposure system on pulmonary gene expression.,"Nose-only exposure is used to study the distribution and toxicity of airborne contaminants. Restraint of animals in nose-only tubes causes stress, but the impact on pulmonary mRNA levels is unknown. Since stress and xenobiotics activate common pathways, we assessed whether nose-only exposure would alter expression of toxicologically relevant genes in the lungs. To identify candidate genes for further analysis, we first interrogated microarray data to examine time-dependent changes in gene expression in air-control animals from a nose-only inhalation study involving male wild-type C57BL/6 mice and transgenic tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha over-expressing littermates. Comparison of transcript levels immediately and 24 h after a single 4-h nose-only exposure to air revealed differential expression of 280 genes (false discovery rate-adjusted, p < .05). Functional analysis revealed enrichment of immune response, apoptosis, and signalling terms, consistent with effects of restraint stress. We then selected a subset of target genes for comparison of naive animals and air-exposed animals from the inhalation study by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression of genes involved in stress (BNIP, sestrin-1, CDKN1A [p21], GADD45 gamma), glucocorticoid-response (GILZ, Sgk), and signal transduction (MAP3K6, C/EBP-delta) was increased as a result of nose-only exposure (p < .05). In contrast, proinflammatory factors (lymphotoxin-beta, chemokine receptor CXCR5) were decreased (p < .05). Immune gene responses observed in wild-type animals were reduced in animals with lung inflammation, indicating that pathological states can modify the response to nose-only exposure. Observed responses may warrant consideration in the evaluation of materials delivered by nose-only inhalation, and suggest that incorporation of naive animals into nose-only studies should be considered as a best practice.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Errol M.

701b86bf2333bc5b2c3a5aa1ea03094ceac3f600,Antimicrobial peptide similarity and classification through rough set theory using physicochemical boundaries,"BackgroundAntimicrobial peptides attract considerable interest as novel agents to combat infections. Their long-time potency across bacteria, viruses and fungi as part of diverse innate immune systems offers a solution to overcome the rising concerns from antibiotic resistance. With the rapid increase of antimicrobial peptides reported in the databases, peptide selection becomes a challenge. We propose similarity analyses to describe key properties that distinguish between active and non-active peptide sequences building upon the physicochemical properties of antimicrobial peptides. We used an iterative supervised machine learning approach to classify active peptides from inactive peptides with low false discovery rates in a relatively short computational search time.ResultsBy generating explicit boundaries, our method defines new categories of active and inactive peptides based on their physicochemical properties. Consequently, it describes physicochemical characteristics of similarity among active peptides and the physicochemical boundaries between active and inactive peptides in a single process. To build the similarity boundaries, we used the rough set theory approach; to our knowledge, this is the first time that this approach has been used to classify peptides. The modified rough set theory method limits the number of values describing a boundary to a user-defined limit. Our method is optimized for specificity over selectivity. Noting that false positives increase activity assays while false negatives only increase computational search time, our method provided a low false discovery rate. Published datasets were used to compare our rough set theory method to other published classification methods and based on this comparison, we achieved high selectivity and comparable sensitivity to currently available methods.ConclusionsWe developed rule sets that define physicochemical boundaries which allow us to directly classify the active sequences from inactive peptides. Existing classification methods are either sequence-order insensitive or length-dependent, whereas our method generates the rule sets that combine order-sensitive descriptors with length-independent descriptors.

c0d361344070a3d739f8d67e418f34805cd557b7,Screening for partial conjunction hypotheses.,"SUMMARY
We consider the problem of testing for partial conjunction of hypothesis, which argues that at least u out of n tested hypotheses are false. It offers an in-between approach to the testing of the conjunction of null hypotheses against the alternative that at least one is not, and the testing of the disjunction of null hypotheses against the alternative that all hypotheses are not null. We suggest powerful test statistics for testing such a partial conjunction hypothesis that are valid under dependence between the test statistics as well as under independence. We then address the problem of testing many partial conjunction hypotheses simultaneously using the false discovery rate (FDR) approach. We prove that if the FDR controlling procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 57, 289-300) is used for this purpose the FDR is controlled under various dependency structures. Moreover, we can screen at all levels simultaneously in order to display the findings on a superimposed map and still control an appropriate FDR measure. We apply the method to examples from microarray analysis and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), two application areas where the need for partial conjunction analysis has been identified.",2008,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yoav Benjamini"", ids = ""1808156""); list(name = ""Ruth Heller"", ids = ""144622349"")",96dc6c399db8eaa87bfa75b9ecba39ab95f05afb; 201dadf91f2f89144aeec5a0656c6a4f0e4443ef; 25da657800cd63b2ed2316169b555387b0242903; 770fb087eef3e494ff83f80ad6b20d42a4bb9434; 0275a62863912b77b01c455d7e2eaa33656b2166; 02f616785a796c5550c5abae2f5b65464e2d4e20; 6e71451b5380528ac7b36da7285616e90e32a724; 994e97268bc6863358fb3eaf571ec9f336f63b7a; c904acd8a43b84324889bf0f35298937adfb78cc; f4796d4cd98e6b119f3d90932dd8ecf1b33fec67; 2bddac877f016d0425707a259dfa9ac405bab80d; e00cae86c27d6837a88f7fca0935491cef58d831; 217aba004977480711b1c181861e3924398296e9; ace745ec27b3fee7b107654de6f6695e30ebb76b; bb1253adb11687da327fdf588cc79d6b290a41b0; 249177b40dcbea9bddee6b0c218a29f7e9143c41; 9d75523fa95243e6f957d07dfc8ee817dcf5981b; a9e6e7a93a17f340089859b313d0209d41db9271; 42d32165d689765c075ea507433334f1d37f4ca6; d69142471f174a0bbda395f47233d6cfd1cc6155; 0038ffc5a191f0df5898014b424f7e6edc9fa7a8; 6d962648c4c48b1004197d8e93e7fb04bcc64597; eb746b21e0075f9ef7181b69d7ebf07d42b9c4f3; ecf189b8871403a3a4f646debe5139656c2a0f4c; b7aa26dd8b1621bfe747a3eeed8a6fcece912028; 5393d7af75d80410fcecacbdb23c0c10d4d0b03c; f8fdba9c7e718793981f32d0fc298a2702f1ede7; 81bbc6c1594a1408597f1704d8a8ec1c305a4cc5; 2d5917a52b1e074340ab142d25fc05b9e5eda383; 4579016ba0ed5023230e8e778b5852fbe83d05c9; 4b0303d655ed229e9b20ed66970e61e0c206c01b; 9b3073cfc67ee5dfc43ba340bffe82c414ce048a; 1c9780dd13d0024cc7db4e33a13cc126d8160c65; f5a386c19056bbd23582d2ae1d697ec34e5a172c; 3e6d96be3881099930ed3755ef7a25bc04f2bf7e; 12f8227c77be1f7f370d1ac8fe56122296624d34; bfd12ea01618b04d8ec52ebcd61758037b10e519; ee98c051d3dc3721a5e09f2da6aaa3ec6450ebf0; c8ff3617823e1228eac817f0adaf4c22f1209513; 2e5258900ba2f9134dcd5bee4a1f88091a972234; bdfa2e5136e3497477ac28932d303bb169463cce; c117971e646e96ba2577f8a7f39246f021e08544; 6c204fd20f45cb234f49c7730f3c8a16796245ed; 3765a2fb7685b16527fc664cd5cdb6b958c45e78; d557fc158d27edfc23ec5e90300f24d6c9bc193f; 3b253b0911f9e11e9aa9261cb31716717203ad76; c070a0215169f70243d1b8ecfd3e804cb4b042fc; f0fdd4e083e6d119e0a4cfa0ac561f7b6f005e88; 7ff298b972ee7dff3bb5b4b7fb0b6169a4358d43; c2226968f7f5e2a1f79ba9a618863897cc70582e; 90f7597c891ed828401954e14d315f5215cf5d67; 0ae50e4b489a238db047884d58f25b38df9cf15a; 83b4f17f76090794208621e1e811efcfda07e648; 51ef539ee8f3be9078002f07be906d331bb18681; dee623579941905d0a299cc898c2d36261e62528; a9420739e2533c4c2837516298b6ff3087a0ae78; 18c692cbdec61868dc6dc6d6d5c2380867006beb; c338920b2362b3b2b62485b5e0e225c72903aea0; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 58ba291ce4912b17056edf9510d27dcb7aa75dd2; 56d17f14f1eb41c7be3c5e1a964c3a6ef4a31c63; 360c1a8adc5b09e6b7a9ecd0356c1268905a34f7; 77ccad5e03bc179b0a5fd03b9501e34d95771144; c93060355830534d0c146fbd3005e7391406aaad; dd0d85a3f5702b7c580ea63610ef8b5c93d7dbe9; 3582bea873386a0c74366055fb35615cf0f42d69; 252ecca39261f9173f11561bdf994b79d60eeb22; dd35c3b66e5c0977b5c0b0ac4916482bd02e0532; 2e382bc4d42c0fa121760e003ac51a7e2dd5fad0; 2fbf012ce319ddf28ab1e1f07b679c65ce739c24; 6e1eaceb24ff4a8f730250674cd8e932d7b75b46; fde12e0b207bcd0ee820f4645d63132458bafdbd; 93b10e02655c4780b14d5ac20152496e9cf564ac; 00b38daea243a4bdb6064022dbc28c8c0fb40d7d; 1476f61b9caf929a978c62eecd1f247e7a89671e; e790932b0ecb8ea31ee3704b3d136d61c7f59e9c; deab750c3e2b55c222289146de718b87dfd671ec; efd61e2ae0c79eb21cf44d2b9c6b460604c51f83; 7836a188045697c98c49b8e288dd25994a394e41; cff1629a3c4bad79928bdf9f35736054a45b6f05; e47a6fb258f37fc3596435d8e21390c1e37b96af; e67bcbbd1eec1eeea9827d802ee1b64753d31c95; 105a19431ddfcfd2e6195176059a49c3232ddda4; 3d2c1e85198ce031ce707afdec8b1337ed9fca02; 08bee902080e1ebe051fd13502346cae3bfaa105,35fe8613aa55680df715b3113fd1d9d2c7cf2fd8; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 618a9b4b73ff6d087fdccea2a1a850a38152e2e5; 1476f61b9caf929a978c62eecd1f247e7a89671e; a669b45393d1087afa0229680c81088e9022f4cc; e6d681ce999a79964d02c3a4d4a873f4e708f241; 8f31f1026b8e752b131f376e4b68d44775edddc0; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 504d2a8d6e07bf3aa084e9f558aeb3f458ec3444; 42cfbc87f5b1bcf6eda42a8c4d982a4c1dc32990; 67da0ad0980945d5ada9162215b2bc04dc429699; 73ed1515be8e2d5bef6d0545aaea6258553f9d44; 56dc9d42efafb79778045710772d89900c64f571; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; b3190250f656296552b3e614f453ff4bdcaaa3b1; 25897bc629171073a21cef5ac3871e16a428877e; 97df6a394f63eedbde7afac8d6d48fd1f29037b2; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; 96a0bd3baa22fa3330b87943fed790160b0af7fe; 4acb6c4665346187075da254377b3ca322e45bc3; c304fb89f8c02848c039cc41da78b5b2e9851671,Biometrics,64 4,"

Materials and Methods Retrospective data evaluation was approved by the local ethics committee, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. Preoperative MR imaging features were correlated with key molecular characteristics within a single-institution cohort of 152 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Preoperative MR imaging features (n = 31) included multiparametric (anatomic and diffusion-, perfusion-, and susceptibility-weighted images) and multiregional (contrast-enhancing regions and hyperintense regions at nonenhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging) information with histogram quantification of tumor volumes, volume ratios, apparent diffusion coefficients, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and intratumoral susceptibility signals. Molecular characteristics determined included global DNA methylation subgroups (eg, mesenchymal, RTK I ""PGFRA,"" RTK II ""classic""), MGMT promoter methylation status, and hallmark copy number variations (EGFR, PDGFRA, MDM4, and CDK4 amplification; PTEN, CDKN2A, NF1, and RB1 loss). Univariate analyses (voxel-lesion symptom mapping for tumor location, Wilcoxon test for all other MR imaging features) and machine learning models were applied to study the strength of association and discriminative value of MR imaging features for predicting underlying molecular characteristics. Results There was no tumor location predilection for any of the assessed molecular parameters (permutation-adjusted P > .05). Univariate imaging parameter associations were noted for EGFR amplification and CDKN2A loss, with both demonstrating increased Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood volume and Gaussian-normalized relative cerebral blood flow values (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 63%-69%, false discovery rate-adjusted P < .05). Subjecting all MR imaging features to machine learning-based classification enabled prediction of EGFR amplification status and the RTK II glioblastoma subgroup with a moderate, yet significantly greater, accuracy (63% for EGFR [P < .01], 61% for RTK II [P = .01]) than prediction by chance; prediction accuracy for all other molecular parameters was not significant. Conclusion The authors found associations between established MR imaging features and molecular characteristics, although not of sufficient strength to enable generation of machine learning classification models for reliable and clinically meaningful prediction of molecular characteristics in patients with glioblastoma.

a1f9b466fb2a51eb62e625ac753daa936bdcc204,Reconstruction of the Protein-Protein Interaction Network for Protein Complexes Identification by Walking on the Protein Pair Fingerprints Similarity Network,"Identifying protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) is important to understand the science of cellular organization and function. However, PPINs produced by high-throughput studies have high false discovery rate and only represent snapshot interaction information. Reconstructing higher quality PPINs is essential for protein complex identification. Here we present a Multi-Level PPINs reconstruction (MLPR) method for protein complexes detection. From existing PPINs, we generated full combinations of every two proteins. These protein pairs are represented as a vector which includes six different sources. Then the protein pairs with same vector are mapped to the same fingerprint ID. A fingerprint similarity network is constructed next, in which a vertex represents a protein pair fingerprint ID and each vertex is connected to its top 10 similar fingerprints by edges. After random walking on the fingerprints similarity network, each vertex got a score at the steady state. According to the score of protein pairs, we considered the top ranked ones as reliable PPI and the score as the weight of edge between two distinct proteins. Finally, we expanded clusters starting from seeded vertexes based on the new weighted reliable PPINs. Applying our method on the yeast PPINs, our algorithm achieved higher F-value in protein complexes detection than the-state-of-the-art methods. The interactions in our reconstructed PPI network have more significant biological relevance than the exiting PPI datasets, assessed by gene ontology. In addition, the performance of existing popular protein complexes detection methods are significantly improved on our reconstructed network.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Xu"", ids = ""143876192""); list(name = ""Yu Liu"", ids = ""46398746""); list(name = ""Chi Lin"", ids = ""47532530""); list(name = ""Jie Dong"", ids = ""143951704""); list(name = ""Xiaoxia Liu"", ids = ""1679912""); list(name = ""Zengyou He"", ids = ""10231415"")",3cca22cb96e49a6d6c004d210486110d9af5b533; f5ba180784aca59a98df5c9659e5094f9caa70c4,33c0e04d4f8f5199a1ce81b033e6751e5bd05720; 9d1e40b9bfad92bb018cc04c63e88b8c12675790; c93eab16df5bf544c8c1faad5780614ced1f24e7; 6b092ee6d04b4fa76a0452cf0696086a7c04644d; e7148e7327e8445c736510c3681a999c6cf8203b; f44ff0677dd1fc960f5cdf9d2ef4f8a5a56ba77d; fca7149cd7df7cb846ca6e3b8be55b587ddb709c; 59a5da1f1138c7199daa22a52d8ab6db3c9ec937; 67a5baadea4d2ce1aa5bf0e468844761f4339430; bf17386da819220492d76084009c00d5faf5db67; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 1037548f688bd3e566df0d4184509976695124cf; bedc37043f4e43309d7883aa67c5545726b52acc; 85a96dd8df351b5a624c76029e5ad2a3c474631e; 30fa728cb99afaa43f7f2ed291d6e06a85663cca; f6841c262d25474fa6464bc2c640da0dda809329; a28aab171a7951a48f31e36ef92d309c2c4f0265; 175ce1b127af3c6b79197229366e29dd223db154; 0e08a9063fd781c7df0a48798d0f13e44edec702; 1022261a01949036f7a9c6dc1b1eae60ca36feb8; 7427faf58516c01da79830a4edc6a98fdf902bc1; 1b8769d36acfba568e679a35801281d32d4268c2; a468c4a29dd982818ec539b7010abb982123b99b; d8a80963ff56079f900a48ac4771ee3c58710e74; 066952ebf26800cbe31708a3bdaf4aa48e94b678; 7cdef02d85ce72705d2896ae3dbd97dd090ff9b2; c530ed57d05dc11b4698e120b4eb164979de2d29; 45604c7c54a6ed3aa1bcaffae0037f07d779d3e6; 955fe5b0eb5e9fefab7bf21dede20e1285dca410; bc270cf6c3c0fc61d90b5cdd98615537cdbeff13; df9fcf32b0320057e90624b6e16778a3787be648; 0d88e6b183cfaed3bf4b2f2e766fb458e17c8cf9; 45a107001b768268d5e2740140331bbf68bd510b; af47ec845f1b60e2117bb1a093de224429786e8c; f13b18f27794bebd7852a1b56810f17b8b081f8a; b248b9d08097904044be1ed5a7312209a07a62f3,Frontiers in Genetics,9,
745ac690dd95d6cee3babc5060df0a67d864aa27,Upregulated expression of the antioxidant sestrin 2 identified by transcriptomic analysis of Japanese encephalitis virus-infected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) exerts a profound burden of viral encephalitis. We have investigated the differentially expressed transcripts in the neuronal transcriptome during JEV infection by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of virus-infected SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Gene ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment from two main pathways: endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-nucleus signaling (P value: 5.75Eâˆ’18; false discovery rate [FDR] 3.11Eâˆ’15) and the ER unfolded protein response (P value: 7.58Eâˆ’18; FDR 3.11Eâˆ’15). qPCR validation showed significant upregulation and differential expression (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) of ER stress-signaling transcripts (SESN2, TRIB3, DDIT3, DDIT4, XBP1, and ATF4) at 24 h post-infection for both low (LN) and high (HN) neurovirulence JEV strains. Immunoblot analysis following JEV infection of SH-SY5Y cells showed an increase in levels of SESN2 protein following JEV infection. Similarly, Zika virus (MR766) infection of SH-SY5Y showed a titer-dependent increase in ER stress-signaling transcripts; however, this was absent or diminished for DDIT4 and ATF4, respectively, suggestive of differences in the induction of stress-response transcripts between flaviviruses. Interestingly, SLC7A11 and SLC3A2 mRNA were also both deregulated in JEV-infected SH-SY5Y cells and encode the two constituent subunits of the plasma membrane xCT amino acid antiporter that relieves oxidative stress by export of glutamate and import of cystine. Infection of SH-SY5Y and HEK293T cells by the JEV HN strain Sw/Mie/40/2004 lead to significant upregulation of the SLC7A11 mRNA to levels comparable to DDIT3. Our findings suggest upregulation of antioxidants including SESN2 and, also, the xCT antiporter occurs to counteract the oxidative stress elicited by JEV infection.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael Carr"", ids = ""103963920""); list(name = ""Gabriel Gonzalez"", ids = ""145286665""); list(name = ""Axel Martinelli"", ids = ""50632587""); list(name = ""Christida Estu Wastika"", ids = ""98791010""); list(name = ""Kimihito Ito"", ids = ""38673018""); list(name = ""Yasuko Orba"", ids = ""4744757""); list(name = ""Michihito Sasaki"", ids = ""3991346""); list(name = ""William W.

69c5797048c183a8ab0422022f6b846a1711fe9b,Hidden partners: Using cross-docking calculations to predict binding sites for proteins with multiple interactions,"Protein-protein interactions control a large range of biological processes and their identification is essential to understand the underlying biological mechanisms. To complement experimental approaches, in silico methods are available to investigate protein-protein interactions. Cross-docking methods, in particular, can be used to predict protein binding sites. However, proteins can interact with numerous partners and can present multiple binding sites on their surface, which may alter the binding site prediction quality. We evaluate the binding site predictions obtained using complete cross-docking simulations of 358 proteins with two different scoring schemes accounting for multiple binding sites. Despite overall good binding site prediction performances, 68 cases were still associated with very low prediction quality, presenting individual area under the specificity-sensitivity ROC curve (AUC) values below the random AUC threshold of 0.5, since cross-docking calculations can lead to the identification of alternate protein binding sites (that are different from the reference experimental sites). For the large majority of these proteins, we show that the predicted alternate binding sites correspond to interaction sites with hidden partners, i.e. partners not included in the original cross-docking dataset. Among those new partners, we find proteins, but also nucleic acid molecules. Finally, for proteins with multiple binding sites on their surface, we investigated the structural determinants associated with the binding sites the most targeted by the docking partners.

3c632f88c008d1ce722b179553956be2cf7af90a,Assessing the role of long-noncoding RNA in nucleus accumbens in subjects with alcohol dependence,"Recently, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) were implicated in the etiology of alcohol dependence (AD). As lncRNA provide another layer of complexity to the transcriptome, assessing their expression in the brain is the first critical step towards understanding lncRNA functions in AD. To that end, we profiled the expression of lncRNA and protein coding genes (PCG) in nucleus accumbens (NAc) from 41 subjects with AD and 41 controls. At false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified 69 and 309 differentially expressed lncRNA and PCG genes, respectively. Using co-expression network analyses, we identified three lncRNA and five PCG modules significantly correlated with AD at Bonferroni adj. pâ‰¤0.05. To better understand lncRNA functions, we integrated the lncRNA and PCG hubs from the significant AD modules; at FDR of 5%, we identified 3 151 positive and 2 255 negative correlations supporting the functional role of lncRNA in the development of AD. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that PCG significantly correlated with lncRNA are, among others, enriched for neuronal and immune related processes. To highlight the mechanisms, by which genetic variants contribute to AD, we integrated lncRNA and PCG hubs with genome-wide SNP data. At FDRâ‰¤0.3, we identified 276 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), affecting the expression of 20 and 256 lncRNA and PCG hubs, respectively. Our study is the first to profile lncRNA expression in nucleus accumbens in a large postmortem alcohol brain sample and our results may provide novel insights into the regulation of the brain transcriptome across disease.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""G.

526bbcf5e47530f2e2ecd43db5f6fa054f96c9ca,Title An integrative Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression model for the analysis of taxonomic abundances in microbiome data Permalink,"Background: The Human Microbiome has been variously associated with the immune-regulatory mechanisms involved in the prevention or development of many non-infectious human diseases such as autoimmunity, allergy and cancer. Integrative approaches which aim at associating the composition of the human microbiome with other available information, such as clinical covariates and environmental predictors, are paramount to develop a more complete understanding of the role of microbiome in disease development. Results: In this manuscript, we propose a Bayesian Dirichlet-Multinomial regression model which uses spike-and-slab priors for the selection of significant associations between a set of available covariates and taxa from a microbiome abundance table. The approach allows straightforward incorporation of the covariates through a log-linear regression parametrization of the parameters of the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood. Inference is conducted through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and selection of the significant covariates is based upon the assessment of posterior probabilities of inclusions and the thresholding of the Bayesian false discovery rate. We design a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and then apply our model on a publicly available dataset obtained from the Human Microbiome Project which associates taxa abundances with KEGG orthology pathways. The method is implemented in specifically developed R code, which has been made publicly available. Conclusions: Our method compares favorably in simulations to several recently proposed approaches for similarly structured data, in terms of increased accuracy and reduced false positive as well as false negative rates. In the application to the data from the Human Microbiome Project, a close evaluation of the biological significance of our findings confirms existing associations in the literature.",2017,,"list(name = ""W.

We have previously reported temporal changes in the endometrial transcriptome during the estrous cycle which differ between uterine horns. The objective of this study was to compare the transcriptomic response of endometrium from the ipsilateral and contralateral horns to an elongating conceptus. Cross-bred beef heifers (n= 16) were synchronized and either used to generate day 14 conceptuses following the transfer of in vitro-produced blastocysts, or to obtain day 14 endometrial explants. Conceptuses were recovered on day 14 by post-mortem uterine flushing, placed individually on top of explants collected from the ipsilateral (IPSI-D14) or the contralateral (CONTRA-D14) uterine horn of cyclic heifers, and co-cultured for 6 h. The response to a conceptus was markedly different between uterine horns, with 61 and 239 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; false discovery rate < 0.05) in the ipsilateral and contralateral horns respectively, compared to their controls. Direct comparison between IPSI-D1 and CONTRA-D14 revealed 32 DEGs, including CXCL11, CXCL10, IFIT2, RSAD2 and SAMD9. Gene Ontology analysis of these 32 genes revealed 10 enriched biological processes, mainly related to immune response and response to an external stimulus. These data indicate that the endometrial response to the presence of a conceptus varies between uterine horns in the same uterus and may contribute to the higher incidence of pregnancy loss following embryo transfer to the contralateral horn.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sandra BagÃ©s-Arnal"", ids = ""1405476211""); list(name = ""JosÃ© M SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""79906175""); list(name = ""Beatriz Fernandez-Fuertes"", ids = ""1398068194""); list(name = ""Michael McDonald"", ids = ""46465150""); list(name = ""Susanta K Behura"", ids = ""3828128""); list(name = ""Thomas E Spencer"", ids = ""152329981""); list(name = ""Trudee Fair"", ids = ""144445611""); list(name = ""Patrick Lonergan"", ids = ""143970774"")",,,Reproduction,,
3919b0fc227327040748dbe68faed826042ed94e,Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity and connectivity predict poor sertraline treatment outcome in lateâ€life depression,"OBJECTIVE
Previous studies of imaging predictors on acute treatment response in late-life depression (LLD) demonstrated that poor response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with pre-treatment low functional connectivity (FC) within executive control network and high FC within default-mode network including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, there is less research in regional resting-state functional activity that explains FC changes related to SSRI response.


METHODS
Thirty-six older major depressive disorder (MDD) patients not currently on antidepressant treatment had a baseline, pre-treatment resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, followed by sertraline treatment for 12Â weeks. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Subjects whose MADRS score decreased less than 50% from baseline or who discontinued sertraline for any reason were classified as nonresponders (nÂ =Â 21). Subjects whose 12-week MADRS score dropped greater than or equal to 50% from baseline were defined as responders (nÂ =Â 15). We conducted the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI FC analyses independently. Significance threshold was set at PÂ <Â 0.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Relative to the responder group, the nonresponder group showed significantly less ALFF in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and greater ALFF in the vmPFC/subgenual cingulate area. For ROI-to-ROI connectivity, there was significantly greater connectivity between the vmPFC and the cerebellar vermis in the nonresponder group.


CONCLUSION
Our study highlighted the association of vmPFC resting-state activity and connectivity with SSRI response.

Our hypothesis was that certain combinations of markers had a synergistic effect on those patients with a complete response (pCR) versus other responses. Methods: 132 rectal cancer patientsâ€™ tumors were evaluated for mutations and polymorphisms in 23 genes. The factors were selected prospectively as having the potential to influence CRT outcome. Our selected risk factors were transformed to yes/no values from predetermined cutoffs. We performed a massive computational combinatorics search for those combinations of factors associated with tumor response (3 million possible combinations). Our best sets of candidates were those with the largest association with tumor response to CRT (CR vs other) by Fisherâ€™s Exacttests after adjusting for False Discovery Rate. Results: 33 of 132 (25%) patients achieved a pCR and 99 (75%) patients had non-pCR. Our result...,2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""David D.

8048e678f55eb5face8a74fc8c7c5d9bac6a707f,Hydroxyurea Treatment Is Associated with Elevated Serum Erythropoietin Concentration but Suppressed Global Hypoxic Transcriptional Responses in Sickle Cell Disease,"Background 

The level of distorted erythrocytes due to polymerization of hemoglobin S in sickle cell disease (SCD) (Science 1949;110:543) is a major determinant of the severity of hemolysis and microvascular occlusion ( Lancet 2010;376:2018). Erythropoietin (EPO) is elevated in SCD due to hemolytic anemia and a related increase in hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) ( Eur J Haematol 2007;78:183). Hydroxyurea (HU) is widely used in the treatment of SCD. HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase ( Semin Oncol 1992;19(3 Suppl 9):1-10) and promotes Î³ globin synthesis thereby increasing HbF-containing erythrocytes (F cells) while suppressing sickle Î² hemoglobin production ( J Clin Invest 1984;74:652 and 2003;111:231). Increased level of F cells reduces hemolysis and ameliorates clinical complications in SCD. We and others have observed an increase in serum EPO level with HU treatment in SCD despite an increase in the hemoglobin concentration, and we hypothesized that this may be due to the known increased affinity of hemoglobin F for oxygen and related tissue hypoxia ( Blood 2009;114:4639).

Methods 

Messenger RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was profiled using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. Hypoxic transcriptional alteration was defined in 15 Chuvash polycythemia (CP) patients vs. 17 control individuals. CP leads to constitutive up-regulation of HIFs in the absence of anemia or hypoxia. Transcriptional alteration in SCD was determined in 13 HbSS subjects without HU treatment vs. 16 control individuals, and that induced by HU treatment was determined in 19 HbSS subjects with vs. 13 without HU treatment. For meta-analysis on serum EPO concentration, genomic DNA isolated from PBMCs was hybridized to the Illumina Human 610-Quad SNP array. Genotypes were imputed to 1000 genomes project phase 1 data. A linear regression model was applied adjusting for age, gender, hemoglobin concentration, and HU treatment.

Results 

Gene expression changes by HbSS highly correlated with those associated with homozygous VHLR200W (Pearson's r=0.79, Figure 1A). At 5% false discovery rate (FDR), expression levels of 377 genes were altered in both VHLR200W homozygotes and HbSS by >1.2 fold. For these hypoxic genes, the correlation of expression changes between HbSS and homozygous VHLR200W reached r=0.97 (Figure 1B). In contrast to our hypothesis, HU treatment in general suppressed expression changes induced by HbSS (r=-0.85, Figure 1C), especially for the hypoxic genes (r=-0.95, Figure 1D). In VHLR200W homozygotes, 62 of the hypoxic genes correlated with plasma EPO levels (adjusted P<0.05, n=42). These EPO-correlated genes were the most strongly up-regulated hypoxic genes in HbSS (red points in Figure 1B) and also the most strongly suppressed by HU treatment (red points in Figure 1D). Consistent with previous observations, we found that EPO was elevated by HU treatment in two SCD cohorts, and this persisted after adjusting for covariates including hemoglobin concentration which reflects hypoxic as well as inflammatory and hemolytic responses: Walk-PHaSST (Î²=0.49, P=2.5Ã—10-15, n=586) and PUSH children (Î²=0.34, P=2.5Ã—10-7, n=387). This observation suggests that biological signals independent of hypoxic regulation may contribute to EPO production under HU treatment. In a meta-analysis for the Walk-PHaSST and PUSH children cohorts, SNP rs60684937, located within the first intron of MAP2K6 , an upstream regulator of HIF signaling ( Mole Cell Biol 2005; 25:4853), was significantly associated with EPO levels at genome-wide significance (combined P=3.5Ã—10-8). The C allele of the SNP decreased EPO levels in both Walk-PHaSST (Î²=-0.30, n=388) and PUSH children (Î²=-0.24, n=249) cohorts. This association was validated in an additional 89 SCD patients from the Howard cohort (Î²=-0.39, P=0.011). Further investigations are needed to determine whether the causal polymorphism affects protein function or gene regulation of the nearby genes.

Discussion 

Our study demonstrates a prominent release from hypoxic transcriptional responses by HU treatment in SCD despite an increase in serum EPO, a defining characteristic of an up-regulated hypoxic response. Our study hypothesizes that hypoxia-independent signals trigger EPO production in the setting of HU therapy and it identifies a potential genetic determinant in this alternative pathway.

2dfb777be632438a77a11557e23da58cb5a40fef,Contribution of heritability and epigenetic factors to skeletal muscle mass variation in UK twins,"Context: Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is one of the major components of human body composition, with deviations from normal values often leading to sarcopenia. Objective: Our major aim was to conduct a genome-wide DNA methylation study in an attempt to identify potential genomic regions associated with SMM. Design: This was a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study. Setting: Community-based study. Participants: A total of 1550 middle-aged UK twin (monozygotic and dizygotic) twins, 297 of which were repeatedly measured participated in the study. Main Outcome Measure: Appendicular lean mass assessed using DXA technology, and MeDIP-seq DNA methylation profiling genome-wide were obtained from each individual. Results: Heritability estimate of SMM, with simultaneous adjustment for covariates obtained using variance decomposition analysis was h2=0.809Â±0.050. After quality control and analysis of longitudinal stability, the DNA methylation data comprised of 723,029 genomic sites, with positive correlations between repeated measurements (Rrepeated =0.114â€“0.905). Correlations between MZ and DZ twins were 0.51 and 0.38 at a genome-wide average, respectively and clearly increased with Rrepeated. Testing for DNA methylation association with SMM in 50 discordant MZ twins revealed 36,081 nominally significant results, of which the top-ranked 134 signals (P 0.40) were subjected to replication in the sample of 1,196 individuals. Seven SMM-methylation association signals replicated at a false discovery rate Conclusion: This epigenome-wide study, testing longitudinally stable methylation sites discovered and replicated a number of associations between DNA methylation at CpG loci and skeletal muscle mass. Four replicated signals were related to genes with potential muscle functions, suggesting that the methylome of whole blood may be informative of SMM variation",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Gregory Livshits"", ids = ""145529366""); list(name = ""Fei Gao"", ids = ""47411788""); list(name = ""Ida Malkin"", ids = ""113578809""); list(name = ""Maria Needhamsen"", ids = ""5555811""); list(name = ""Yudong Xia"", ids = ""34512432""); list(name = ""Wei Yuan"", ids = ""153714869""); list(name = ""Christopher G.

Such ambiguity is most likely in large exploratory studies requiring numerous simultaneous inferences. In ambiguous situations it is desirable that results of multiple-comparison procedures depend little on the chosen family. To assess this, we propose several familywise robustness criteria to evaluate such procedures, and we find some of their properties theoretically and by simulation.

37305ee972a69ef0eb22cd20b201f46490c31868,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in placentas from preterm infants: association with maternal socioeconomic status.,"This study evaluated the hypothesis that prenatal maternal socioeconomic status (SES) adversity is associated with DNA methylation in the placenta. SES adversity was defined by the presence of, as well as a summative count of, four factors: less than college education, single marital status, food and nutritional service assistance, and public health insurance. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina EPIC array in 426 placentas from a sample of infants born < 28Â weeks of gestation from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn cohort. Associations between SES adversity and DNA methylation were assessed with robust linear regressions adjusted for covariates and controlled the false discovery rate at < 10%. We also examined whether such associations were sex specific. Indicators of SES adversity were associated with differential methylation at 33 CpG sites. Of the 33 identified CpG sites, 19 (57.6%) displayed increased methylation, and 14 (42.4%) displayed decreased methylation in association with at least one of the SES adversity factors. Sex differences were observed in DNA methylation associated with summative SES score; in which placentas derived from female pregnancies showed more robust differential CpG methylation than placentas from male pregnancies. Maternal SES adversity was associated with differential methylation of genes with key role in gene transcription and placental function, potentially altering immunity and stress response. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the role of epigenetic differences in mediating the association between maternal socioeconomic status during pregnancy and later life health outcomes in children.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hudson P Santos"", ids = ""144002684""); list(name = ""Arjun Bhattacharya"", ids = ""51211742""); list(name = ""Elizabeth Marie Martin"", ids = ""47139335""); list(name = ""Kezia Addo"", ids = ""50688016""); list(name = ""Matt Psioda"", ids = ""35388629""); list(name = ""Lisa Smeester"", ids = ""6751529""); list(name = ""Robert M.

a0b3b563ebe2fd968c06d99e02500a6b169e815a,Implication of NOTCH1 gene in susceptibility to anxiety and depression among sexual abuse victims,"Sexual abuse contributes to the development of multiple forms of psychopathology, including anxiety and depression, but the extent to which genetics contributes to these disorders among sexual abuse victims remains unclear. In this translational study, we first examined gene expression in the brains of rodents exposed to different early-life conditions (long, brief or no maternal separation). Hypothesizing that genes revealing changes in expression may have relevance for psychiatric symptoms later in life, we examined possible association of those genes with symptoms of anxiety and depression in a human sample of sexual abuse victims. Changes in rodent brain gene expression were evaluated by means of correspondence and significance analyses of microarrays by comparing brains of rodents exposed to different early-life conditions. Tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of resulting candidate genes were genotyped and tested for their association with symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) in a sample of 361 sexual abuse victims, using multinomial logistic regression. False discovery rate was applied to account for multiple testing in the genetic association study, with q-value of 0.05 accepted as significant. We identified four genes showing differential expression among animals subjected to different early-life conditions as well as having potential relevance to neural development or disorders: Notch1, Gabrr1, Plk5 and Zfp644.

6d82b5eede705b7b1a14b205e493072347edca3c,Transcriptomics of Human Arteriovenous Fistula Failure: Genes Associated With Nonmaturation.,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE
Improving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) outcomes requires better understanding of the biology underlying maturation or failure. Our current knowledge of maturation reliesÂ on extrapolation from other vascular pathologies, which does not incorporate unique aspects of AVF remodeling. This study compares the RNA expression of pre-access (native) veins and AVFs with distinct maturation outcomes.


STUDY DESIGN
Case-control study.


SETTING & PARTICIPANTS
64 patients undergoing 2-stage AVF surgeries at a single center. 19 native veins and 19 AVF samples were analyzed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). 58 native veins were studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction; 45, using immunohistochemistry; and 19, using Western blot analysis.


PREDICTOR
RNA expression in native veins and AVFs.


OUTCOME
Anatomic nonmaturation, defined as an AVF that never achieved an internal diameterÂ â‰¥ 6mm.


ANALYTICAL APPROACH
Pre-access native veins and AVF samples were obtained from patients undergoing 2-stage AVF creation. Veins that subsequently matured or failed after access creation were analyzed using RNA-seq to search for genes associated with maturation failure. Genes associated with nonmaturation were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. In addition, the association between pre-access gene expression and postoperative morphology was evaluated. RNA-seq was also performed on AVFs to search for transcriptional differences between AVFs that matured and those that failed at the time of transposition.


RESULTS
Pro-inflammatory genes (CSF3R, FPR1, S100A8, S100A9, and VNN2) were upregulated in pre-access veins that failed (false discovery rateÂ < 0.05), and their expression colocalized to smooth muscle cells. Expression of S100A8 and S100A9 correlated with postoperative intimal hyperplasia and the product of medial fibrosis and intimal hyperplasia (r=0.32-0.38; P < 0.05). AVFs that matured or failed were transcriptionally similar at the time of transposition.


LIMITATIONS
Small sample size, analysis of only upper-arm veins and transposed fistulas.


CONCLUSIONS
Increased expression of proinflammatory genes in pre-access veins appears to be associated with greater risk for AVF nonmaturation.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Laisel Martinez"", ids = ""40339131""); list(name = ""Marwan Tabbara"", ids = ""46441590""); list(name = ""Juan Camilo Duque"", ids = ""2593597""); list(name = ""Guillermo Selman"", ids = ""5938972""); list(name = ""Nieves Santos FalcÃ³n"", ids = ""7199448""); list(name = ""Angela Mercedes Raba PÃ¡ez"", ids = ""32243931""); list(name = ""Anthony J.

cee9d5a3a96735d84ef7586b0c4bde7c57af93d5,Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C regulated genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines.,"EBV nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is an essential transcription factor for EBV transformed lymphoblast cell line (LCL) growth. To identify EBNA3C-regulated genes in LCLs, microarrays were used to measure RNA abundances in each of three different LCLs that conditionally express EBNA3C fused to a 4-OH-Tamoxifen-dependent estrogen receptor hormone binding domain (EBNA3CHT). At least three RNAs were assayed for each EBNA3CHT LCL under nonpermissive conditions, permissive conditions, and nonpermissive conditions with wild-type EBNA3C transcomplementation. Using a two-way ANOVA model of EBNA3C levels, we identified 550 regulated genes that were at least 1.5-fold up- or down-regulated with false discovery rates < 0.01. EBNA3C-regulated genes overlapped significantly with genes regulated by EBNA2 and EBNA3A consistent with coordinated effects on cell gene transcription. Of the 550 EBNA3C-regulated genes, 106 could be placed in protein networks. A seeded Bayesian network analysis of the 80 most significant EBNA3C-regulated genes suggests that RAC1, LYN, and TNF are upstream of other EBNA3C-regulated genes. Gene set enrichment analysis found enrichment for MAP kinase signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, JAK-STAT signaling, and cell adhesion molecules, implicating these pathways in EBNA3C effects on LCL growth or survival. EBNA3C significantly up-regulated the CXCL12 ligand and its CXCR4 receptor and increased LCL migration. CXCL12 up-regulation depended on EBNA3C's interaction with the cell transcription factor, RBPJ, which is essential for LCL growth. EBNA3C also up-regulated MYC 1.3-fold and down-regulated CDKN2A exons 2 and 3, shared by p16 and p14, 1.4-fold, with false discovery rates < 5 Ã— 10(-4).",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Zhao"", ids = ""144932908""); list(name = ""Jessica C.

50f24c6dd891435b0bdcd8ba81bdd0fb67d4c579,A note on variable selection in functional regression via random subspace method,"Variable selection problem is one of the most important tasks in regression analysis, especially in a high-dimensional setting. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of scalar response functional regression model, which is a linear model with scalar response and functional regressors. The functional model can be represented by certain multiple linear regression model via basis expansions of functional variables. Based on this model and random subspace method of Mielniczuk and Teisseyre (Comput Stat Data Anal 71:725â€“742, 2014), two simple variable selection procedures for scalar response functional regression model are proposed. The final functional model is selected by using generalized information criteria. Monte Carlo simulation studies conducted and a real data example show very satisfactory performance of new variable selection methods under finite samples. Moreover, they suggest that considered procedures outperform solutions found in the literature in terms of correctly selected model, false discovery rate control and prediction error.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Lukasz Smaga"", ids = ""8076349""); list(name = ""Hidetoshi Matsui"", ids = ""145002438"")",,,Statistical Methods & Applications,27,455-477
1203277b668edaab34a8d863ad5d9bddfb77ae3e,Abstract A06: Integration of synthetic lethality and genomic data to identify significant molecular vulnerabilities in ovarian cancer,"Background: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the second leading cause of death from a gynecologic malignancy in the U.S. The overall survival rate has not changed over the last 30 years thereby necessitating new therapeutic approaches. Targeted therapeutics that have come to the forefront of exploration such as anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR, have resulted in only marginal improvements in overall survival. We have used a functional genomics approach followed by analyzing TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) ovarian dataset to help identify significant potential molecular targets that represent key points of therapeutic intervention. Methods: We employed an unbiased high-throughput lethality screen using a 24,088 siRNA library targeting 6,022 â€œdruggableâ€ genes and tested for effects on growth and/or survival of A1847 EOC cells. Candidate hits from the primary screen were rescreened in a secondary screen across six additional EOC cell lines (OVCAR5, SKOV3, A2780, C30, CP70 and UPN275), and three non-tumorigenic, immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cell lines (HIO-80, HIO-117, HIO-120). We further validated and eliminated the leading hits which may be due to potential off-target effects by rescreening individual siRNAs from the initial siRNAs pools and by performing quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Mechanistic exploration with each of the lead candidates was performed in A2780 cells using Guava cell cycle and Nexin assays. Clinical datasets for lead candidate genes were obtained from https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/ (n=494) and analyzed for gene expression, DNA methylation, copy number variation (CNV) and survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis). Results: Building on the concept of â€œoncogenic addictionâ€ we performed a primary lethality screen using A1847 cells and identified 300 genes that were considered essential for tumor cell growth and/or survival. These hits were defined as a gene that reduced cell viability by >15% with a false discovery rate of â‰¤5%. In the secondary screen, each of the ten cell lines exhibited a unique number of hits ranging from 27-94% of the total siRNAs screened. Fifty-three gene candidates were found to exhibit effects in all seven tumorigenic cell lines. Extensive validation of these hits refined the list to four top priority candidates (HSPA5, NDC80, NUF2 and PTN) that reduced the viability of all the EOC cell lines with minimal effects on the non-tumorigenic HOSE lines. In A2780 cells, HSPA5, NDC80, NUF2 and PTN siRNA treatment led to an average 2.5-fold (n=3, p 1.5-fold increase compared with normal tissues) in 99.8%, 99.8% and 40% of patients, respectively. CNV analysis for these three genes showed that the samples with copy number gain exhibited an average 1.6-fold increase (p-value Conclusion: Our functional studies integrated with genomics data provide an important, unbiased avenue towards addressing an urgent and unmet clinical need for identification of prospective therapeutic targets for drug discovery and treatment of ovarian cancer.

e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee,Online Rules for Control of False Discovery Rate and False Discovery Exceedance,"Multiple hypothesis testing is a core problem in statistical inference and arises in almost every scientific field. Given a set of null hypotheses $\mathcal{H}(n) = (H_1,\dotsc, H_n)$, Benjamini and Hochberg introduced the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected proportion of false positives among rejected null hypotheses, and proposed a testing procedure that controls FDR below a pre-assigned significance level. Nowadays FDR is the criterion of choice for large scale multiple hypothesis testing. In this paper we consider the problem of controlling FDR in an ""online manner"". Concretely, we consider an ordered --possibly infinite-- sequence of null hypotheses $\mathcal{H} = (H_1,H_2,H_3,\dots )$ where, at each step $i$, the statistician must decide whether to reject hypothesis $H_i$ having access only to the previous decisions. This model was introduced by Foster and Stine. We study a class of ""generalized alpha-investing"" procedures and prove that any rule in this class controls online FDR, provided $p$-values corresponding to true nulls are independent from the other $p$-values. (Earlier work only established mFDR control.) Next, we obtain conditions under which generalized alpha-investing controls FDR in the presence of general $p$-values dependencies. Finally, we develop a modified set of procedures that also allow to control the false discovery exceedance (the tail of the proportion of false discoveries). Numerical simulations and analytical results indicate that online procedures do not incur a large loss in statistical power with respect to offline approaches, such as Benjamini-Hochberg.",2016,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Adel Javanmard"", ids = ""2548570""); list(name = ""Andrea Montanari"", ids = ""145071265"")",dc0d302b6559c8fe9c8faefedd31f6eb120c9312; 4b9939462656dcccf3a2efcc6aabe357bcf54e68; 3d4b179a8ea1e7ed76a6d77e232c3d1e2695f959; 6bc2e8dabe36cd75d1e6539b51b262e3716d5525; 4240215cf2b0a816b3b1dd1a967394ff8e088326; 0e619d9f15654317046721f1d4b67d5f009de2c0; a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c; 2a3cd075bd4c0c88117d5d217a8115a7f32cbddd; 1aec3ac8a6a3c83a625253fb65c07c3e9f2c3393; 2396ec6250ca41bc88b9fd3b47ef1a5faa917b59; c794fd003dabe1b4d09ff081ecd9fe0566b729ef; be14c56689603b297e5429a8fe1ecee695cd77c7; e5df492f8982e0f418ba42569488290240c47f6b; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; afc8c291aa589389e6c86407c16a5a646daddaaf; 0be9c023ff77e16ccc25c000249bc13af47aae8e; 782b5102432d341384d5a58590ee1ad30bf0cbc5; acf91f8a26463ba68e6233f2363da31dfad10b31; a45bd631d4acd3c03b84f41261b3736e8a790a98; 175bb823b4ccf2fac22268ac71c342b058ab89cc; 3c32b58d45f761a1f6e81dad3c9605a8135a1ff4; 263d3e0869a0abf2c45fc00737c790237410f51f; 6d30c134d4808ea49456baa62374a54e33dc8f9c; 8ec8e263bdeb534315fa1b74b88bd8489c807658; 9dbb0d0fbceb3174aef95cd87d55270f5dd01444; c904acd8a43b84324889bf0f35298937adfb78cc; f46f16ec9ddb69dec6d594ccea38a51ea5e20312; 88dd551787344978ab57e15e706dd3fbd64389b4; 657cc000a66f741004e13fa21ae3c3c4531ef621; c77e507e6e745c04b5d32e25ffcf11e32e0a5e76; 4382f7ea8e46f91257b7de6beddc9a8d0eb9f4ff; e99ce4cab6c0ab24623944ae0889f6e91b9c6f4d; c18d34ddf5d5c87d4dce3b67a24aa757fbcb8db6; 52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb; 827339609889e4163499f06a4e40a25fcbb37cf9; 3564f17d529d0acdca6a3e75bea4fa5fe3ff6a37; 539df2a572349bc3c05328a0ed23c046dc0229e2,04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; dac8df9c0cc9029963ff7146688782f4265982be; 08d23fdaeec2a46da5189cf105de238fb37bb77e; bcce96a2a074448953fc61a29a84afbdfc8db55a; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 67f33b4ea84c8cf815a9919dd34fee6e85c22f6f; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 96c98cc1351265d2b36f63e32472a34ff38c41fc; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 414c23024b2d2752d92b79eaa388c6fc689260a1; b0e61cfe9d322d8baa3b2c3e94701dd33f0d04fa; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; d96de31c642ee0b147b761c8e9b6bbba39d887c0; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; 8daa9b8e75a7dab7b0d5dec9c6078472e8075fe4; 22a872a231374563cc2aa8b13a75846222a41c74; abc853bd9a67dd87ebce025a7dc94fb467b067b9; 3685e6f7e8817e91249332fc005951af1274044c; fe4deb22a36ad437b0e3afc441774c483fc9fdb6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 8963b5c1a754741d6599b95e47818fe3b79a6a51; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87,ArXiv,abs/1603.09000,
789bcdfced9fe5742bd6a6c2dcd7531afeee0001,Deep Proteomic Analysis of Human Erythropoiesis,"*the first two authors are co-first authors Introduction. Erythropoiesis is a complex process starting from pluripotent medullary progenitors and leading to the production of highly specialized and enucleated erythrocytes. Two successive phases are generally distinguished: an amplification phase with intense proliferation of morphologically similar progenitors and a terminal differentiation phase with few cell divisions and strong cellular modifications. Although erythropoiesis is a continuous process, these modifications allow the identification of specific maturation stages and the passage from one stage to the following one seems to correlate with a cell division. Several transcriptomic analyses of erythroid differentiation have been published but only few and very limited proteomic studies have been reported. Since post transcriptomic modifications are responsible for a large part of the proteome variations, a direct proteomic analysis of the erythroid differentiation is required to accurately assess the modifications that occur during this process. Results. For this study, we used CD34+ cord blood progenitors and an optimized three step cell culture method allowing the production of highly synchronized cell populations of erythroid cells at various differentiation stages. Several cellular populations from erythroid progenitors up to reticulocytes were analyzed by a label-free analysis and mass spectrometry that led to the absolute quantification of more than 6000 proteins with a false discovery rate of less than 1% (n=3). Moreover, the relative expression of well-known stage-specific erythroid markers such as TFRC, BAND3 or GLUT1, transcription factors, heme biosynthesis enzymes followed the expected pattern. To complete this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of the repartition of proteins between the generated reticulocytes and the expelled nucleus (pyrenocyte). To do that, pyrenocytes and reticulocytes were sorted by FACS according to size, Hoechst 33342 and glycophorin A labelling. Equal numbers of reticulocytes and pyrenocytes were used to prepare peptides that were analyzed by mass spectrometry after iTRAQ labelling. These experiments allowed the quantitative repartition of 1153 proteins including most erythrocyte-specific membrane proteins. Conclusion. All these results significantly increase our knowledge of the protein expression pattern during erythropoiesis and should constitute a valuable data base for subsequent studies regarding both physiological and disordered erythropoiesis.

Including many histone PTMs in one search increases the number of candidate peptides dramatically, leading to low search speed and fewer identified spectra. To evaluate database search engines on identifying histone PTMs, we present a method in which one kind of modification is searched each time, for example, unmodified, individually modified, and multimodified, each search result is filtered with false discovery rate less than 1%, and the identifications of multiple search engines are combined to obtain confident results. We apply this method for eight search engines on histone data sets. We find that two search engines, pFind and Mascot, identify most of the confident results at a reasonable speed, so we recommend using them to identify histone modifications. During the evaluation, we also find some important aspects for the analysis of histone modifications. Our evaluation of different search engines on identifying histone modifications will hopefully help those who are hoping to enter the histone proteomics field.

Zur Validierung statistischer ZusammenhÃ¤nge hat sich die Konvention herausgebildet, mÃ¶glichst geringe p-Werte einzufordern und bei Werten unterhalb gewisser Schwellen (z.â€‰B. 0,05) von statistisch signifikanten Ergebnissen zu sprechen. HÃ¤ufig wird der p-Wert auch als Irrtumswahrscheinlichkeit bezeichnet. Beide Begriffe sind problematisch, da sie MissverstÃ¤ndnissen Vorschub leisten. Hinzu kommt, dass das sog. p-hacking, d.â€‰h. die gezielte Suche nach Auswertungen, die zu statistisch signifikanten Ergebnissen fÃ¼hren, Verzerrungen hervorrufen und die Rate falscher Entdeckungen (false discovery rate) erhÃ¶hen kann.

1b2f62cb3576eabfbe34767b39f8a206f2fdf9a6,Effects of prenatal exposure to particulate matter air pollution on corpus callosum and behavioral problems in children,"OBJECTIVE
Air pollution (AP) may affect neurodevelopment, but studies about the effects of AP on the growing human brain are still scarce. We aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to AP on lateral ventricles (LV) and corpus callosum (CC) volumes in children and to determine whether the induced brain changes are associated with behavioral problems.


METHODS
Among the children recruited through a set of representative schools of the city of Barcelona, (Spain) in the Brain Development and Air Pollution Ultrafine Particles in School Children (BREATHE) study, 186 typically developing participants aged 8-12 years underwent brain MRI on the same 1.5â€¯Tâ€¯MR unit over a 1.5-year period (October 2012-April 2014). Brain volumes were derived from structural MRI scans using automated tissue segmentation. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the criteria of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder DSM-IV list. Prenatal fine particle (PM2.5) levels were retrospectively estimated at the mothers' residential addresses during pregnancy with land use regression (LUR) models. To determine whether brain structures might be affected by prenatal PM2.5 exposure, linear regression models were run and adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume (ICV), maternal education, home socioeconomic vulnerability index, birthweight and mothers' smoking status during pregnancy. To test for associations between brain changes and behavioral outcomes, negative binomial regressions were performed and adjusted for age, sex, ICV.


RESULTS
Prenatal PM2.5 levels ranged from 11.8 to 39.5â€¯Î¼g/m3 during the third trimester of pregnancy. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 level (7â€¯Î¼g/m3) was significantly linked to a decrease in the body CC volume (mm3) (Î²â€¯=â€¯-53.7, 95%CI [-92.0, -15.5] corresponding to a 5% decrease of the mean body CC volume) independently of ICV, age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic vulnerability index at home, birthweight and mothers' smoking status during the third trimester of pregnancy. A 50â€¯mm3 decrease in the body CC was associated with a significant higher hyperactivity subscore (Rate Ratio (RR)â€¯=â€¯1.09, 95%CI [1.01, 1.17) independently of age, sex and ICV. The statistical significance of these results did not survive to False Discovery Rate correction for multiple comparisons.

2926c43ffe175ebc5c62929ed224138709980df1,Auswirkungen ausgewÃ¤hlter Einflussfaktoren auf die genomweite DNA-Methylierung beim Menschen,"Umweltfaktoren konnen uber epigenetische Mechanismen das Expressionsmuster von Genen verandern. So kann eine Veranderung des Lebensstils, z.B. Zigarettenkonsum, durch epigenetische Modifikationen, wie die der DNA-Methylierung, wesentlich zur Pathogenese einiger Erkrankungen beitragen. In der hier vorliegenden Arbeit sollte der Einfluss des Alters, eines hohen Body Mass Index (BMI), des Rauchens und der Schichtarbeit auf das DNA-Methylierungsmuster von Zwillingen mittels arraybasierter Technologie analysiert und charakterisiert werden. Die Untersuchung von monozygoten Zwillingen hat dabei den Vorteil, dass aufgrund des gleichen genetischen Hintergrundes der Zwillinge, Veranderungen im DNA-Methylierungsmuster den analysierten Parametern zugeschrieben werden konnen. Aufgrund des auf der primaren Fragestellung dieser Arbeit basierenden Studiendesigns, konnte ein zwillingsbasierter Ansatz nur fur die Analyse des Einflusses der Schichtarbeit gewahlt werden. Fur die Parameter Alter, BMI und Rauchen wurde fur die Identifizierung einer veranderten DNA-Methylierung eine gruppenbasierte Analyse mittels der sog. False Discovery Rate (FDR, q) bzw. eines definierten Signifikanzwertes bei einer gleichzeitigen Differenz der mittleren Methylierungswerte zwischen zwei Gruppen von mindestens 5% (â”‚âˆ†Î²â”‚>0,05) durchgefuhrt. Zusammengefasst wurden folgende Befunde erzielt: 
1. Der Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip konnte in einem Vorexperiment erfolgreich etabliert und somit fur die anschliesenden genomweiten hypothesenfreien DNA-Methylierungsanalysen eingesetzt werden. Diese wurden an aus Zellen des peripheren Blutes isolierter genomischer DNA von monozygoten und dizygoten Zwillingen durchgefuhrt. 
2. Fur die Identifizierung altersabhangig methylierter CpG-Loci wurden insgesamt 53 mono- und 63 dizygote DNA-Proben von Zwillingen im Alter von 20â€“63 Jahren einbezogen. Mittels linearer Regression konnten 111 CpGs bzw. 63 Gene identifiziert werden, deren Methylierung signifikant mit dem Alter korrelierte (q<1x10-11). 47 Gene bzw. 58 Loci konnten dabei die Befunde altersabhangiger Methylierungsveranderungen aus anderen Studien bestatigen, wahrend 16 erstmals neu identifizierte Gene ermittelt werden konnten. Uber eine Genontologie-Analyse konnten unter den insgesamt 63 altersabhangig methylierten Genen statistisch signifikante Anreicherungen fur Gene ermittelt werden, die an Prozessen des Blutdrucks, der Herzkontraktion und des Nervensystems beteiligt sind. 
3. Der Vergleich von funf adiposen und 29 normalgewichtigen Zwillingen lieferte bei einer FDR q 0,05). 3/43 differentiell methylierte Gene (ADORA1, LPGAT1, POM121C) wurden bereits im Zusammenhang mit Adipositas publiziert, wahrend zwei weitere Gene (ADCY5, SYN2) mit einer damit verbundenen Folgeerkrankung, dem Typ-2-Diabetes, assoziiert werden konnten. 
4. Der Vergleich von 12 Rauchern und 25 Nichtrauchern resultierte bei einer FDR q 0,05). Mit beiden Ansatzen konnten Loci und Gene bestatigt werden, fur die andere Studien bereits eine mit dem Rauchen veranderte DNA-Methylierung gezeigt hatten. Insgesamt konnten unter den identifizierten Genen mittels verschiedener Anreicherungsanalysen Gene ermittelt werden, die z.B. in Herzerkrankungen (CACNA1C, GATA4, EVC2, NODAL) und Thrombose (F2RL3, F10), deren Entstehung teilweise durch das Rauchen begunstigt wird, involviert sind. 
5. Bei sechs fur Nachtarbeit diskordanten Zwillingspaaren konnten insgesamt 21 bzw. elf differentiell methylierte Loci bzw. Gene ermittelt werden (p<0,05; â”‚âˆ†Î²â”‚â‰¥0,05). Von diesen konnten zehn ausgewahlte Loci nicht erfolgreich validiert werden, was primar der geringen statistischen Power zugeschrieben wurde. Dennoch wurden 2/21 Loci bzw. 3/11 Gene (SLC11A1, TMEM132D, TRIM10) bereits in anderen Studien mit einer veranderten Methylierung bei Nachtschichtarbeitern identifiziert, was eine mogliche Auswirkung der Nachtarbeit auf den veranderten Methylierungsstatus dieser Gene unterstreicht. Weiterhin konnten fur einige der von differentieller Methylierung betroffenen Gene Assoziationen zu bekannten Risikofaktoren von Schichtarbeit, z.B. dem metabolischen Syndrom (CREB5), erhohter Anfalligkeit fur Infektionen (SLC11A1) sowie Angststorungen (SLC6A1, TMEM132D) gefunden werden. 
Insgesamt lasst sich schlussfolgern, dass die untersuchten Einflussfaktoren mit spezifischen Veranderungen in der DNA-Methylierung korrelieren. Dabei konnten Loci und Gene aus den einzelnen Teilstudien bestatigt und zumindest die Beteiligung einiger der betroffenen Gene in einen entsprechenden plausiblen biologischen Kontext gebracht werden.",2015,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Jana Gutwein"", ids = ""82951947"")",,610f86d88df51fb7e1c52bce1b754fe21cbde915;

6cf6ad536b7d796c921836ebd6f777423fbbf203,Resting state functional connectivity of the amygdala and problem drinking in non-dependent alcohol drinkers.,"Alcohol misuse is associated with dysfunction of the amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuit. The amygdala and its cortical targets show decreased activity during a variety of task challenges in individuals engaged in problem drinking. On the other hand, it is less clear how amygdala resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) may be altered in association with alcohol misuse and whether such changes are restricted to prefrontal cortical structures. Further, the influences of comorbid substance use and depression and potential sex differences have not been assessed in earlier work. Here, with fMRI data from a Nathan Kline Institute/Rockland sample of 83 non-dependent alcohol drinkers (26 men), we addressed changes in whole brain rsFC of the amygdala in association with problem drinking as indexed by an alcohol involvement score. Imaging data were processed with Statistical Parametric Mapping following standard routines and all results were examined at voxel pâ€¯<â€¯0.001 uncorrected in combination with cluster pâ€¯<â€¯0.05 corrected for false discovery rate. Alcohol misuse was correlated with decreased amygdala connectivity with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) irrespective of depression and other substance use. Changes in amygdala-dACC connectivity manifested in the latero-basal subdivision of the amygdala. Further, men as compared to women showed a significantly stronger relationship in decreased amygdala-dACC connectivity and problem drinking, although it should be noted that men also showed a trend toward higher alcohol involvement score than women. The findings add to a growing literature documenting disrupted amygdala-prefrontal cortical functions in relation to alcohol misuse.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sien Hu"", ids = ""1749054""); list(name = ""Jaime S.

053d585e0446df8269a74ddba0a29d7cab2c3683,Associations between HIV Susceptibility and Mutations in the Vif-associated APOBEC 3 G Proteasomal Complex,"The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a hostâ€™s single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Vifassociated APOBEC3G Proteasomal Complex influence his/her innate immunity to Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1. The experimenters compared host DNA at specific sites on each patientâ€™s genome (SNPs) and the patientâ€™s HIV1 disease progression. They extracted DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Then, using high-throughput microarray nano-liter plates, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was run. The PCR gave a signal reading which the experimenters then translated into a genotype reading. Anonymous patient data concerning each individualâ€™s HIV progression were obtained from the National Institute of Health. The experimenters used a univariate analysis along with logistic regression to obtain a P-value, which was then corrected for multiple testing errors. A total of 5,000 patients were analyzed for each of 125 SNPs. After analysis, the experimenters found that the SNPs tested did not have a significant correlation with the viral set-point due to the high q-values that were above .05. Also, there was not a significant correlation between the SNPs tested and the patient CD4+ T-Cell slope. However, the study found an association that trended towards significance between HIV progression and the APOBEC3G associate SNP rs3736685. Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that is prevalent throughout much of the world. HIV affects 33.3 million people worldwide and is related to substance abuse and poverty in an area1,2. As with all viruses, HIV replicates intracellularly. It predominantly uses CD4+ T-helper cells to replicate. Upon antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes initiate apoptosis of the infected cell. However, CD4+ T-cells are reduced in HIV infection, mitigating helper T-cell response. Consequently, infection with HIV is characterized by a decrease in CD4+ T cell count. As T-helper cells play a vital role in acquired immunity, infection with HIV results in a compromised immune system. There are two distinct types of the virus, aptly named HIV1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is most closely related to viruses found in gorillas and chimpanzees. There is also regional variation amongst the subgroup M which is primarily due to the many genome Associations between HIV Susceptibility and Mutations in the Vif-associated APOBEC3G Proteasomal Complex Kevin Emancipator1*, Jack Michuda1*, and Sudhir Penugonda2** Student1: The Illinois Math and Science Academy, 1500 Sullivan Road, Aurora, Illinois Mentor2: Northwestern University-Feinberg School of Medicine, 645 N Michigan Avenue, Suite 900 *These authors contributed equally **Corresponding author: spenugonda@gmail.com INTERNSHIP ARTICLE mutations of the HIV virus. Other subgroups of HIV-1 include group O, which refers to outliers, and group N, which refers to non-M and non-O subgroups. Furthermore, subgroup P refers to a recently analyzed HIV sequence unlike any other HIV virus that bears a stronger resemblance to simian immunodeficiency virus in gorillas than that which is in infected chimpanzees. HIV-2 is far less pathogenic and rarely observed outside of Africa. It is also categorized into several regional subgroups. The study, and all references to HIV, will be concerning HIV-1 group M. As with many viruses, the HIV genome is fairly simple. The production of three structural and six accessory proteins is encoded within the genome. The six accessory proteins are VPU, REV, TAT, NEF, VPR, and VIF. VIF, or viral infectivity factor plays a role in the pathogenesis of the HIV virus by degrading the enzyme APOBEC3G by ubiqutination3. This process is relevant to the study and will be discussed in further detail. HIV enters a CD4+ T cell by binding to CD4+ protein on the surface of the cell. The virus then enters the cell. After undergoing reverse transcriptase, newly formed HIV DNA is transported into the cell nucleus and integrates into host DNA. The integrated DNA services as a template for further viral replication, sometimes preceded by a prolonged latency. Protease acts as a catalyst to help the formation of new viruses. After replication, new viruses bud off infected cells into the body. Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) is a human enzyme that is part of a family that plays a role in innate viral immunity. APOBEC3G is known to exert antiretroviral immune activity. There are several mechanisms by which APOBEC3G is able to inhibit retrovirus reproduction. By causing deoxyctidine to deoxyuridine mutations in the HIV genome, the enzyme interferes with reverse transcription4. Furthermore, it is proposed that a nucleophilic attack causes cytidine deamination4. Deamination results in hypermutations G to A in the viral genome and ultimately resulting in an inability to replicate. Viral infectivity factor (Vif) is a gene that encodes for the VIF protein. This protein increases the pathogenesis of the HIV virus. The VIF protein interferes with host mediated anti-viral defense. Specifically, it neutralizes APOBEC3G, an anti-viral enzyme. VIF inhibits the protein from entering the virion. Furthermore, by binding to APOBEC3G, proteolysis by ubiquitination is initiated, rendering the enzyme ineffective. VIF targets APOBEC3G degradation by removing Cullin5 E3 ubiquitin ligase5. By inactivating the APOBEC3G enzyme through VIF, HIV is able Kevin Emancipator, Jack Michuda, and Sudhir Penugonda Page 2 of 6 Materials and Methods In the study, mutations and variations in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in coding (exon) and non-coding (intron) regions of DNA and the effect of these differences on the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) enzyme and the cullin5 ECS E3 ubiquitin ligase complex were examined. SNPs are biallelic differences in DNA nucleotide bases. There are, on average over 150 polymorphisms for every human gene9. That, coupled with the amount of genes that humans possess, makes for a lot of possible combinations. However, the study looked at specific SNPs on candidate genes that would affect how APOBEC3G or the ligase complex functions. SNPs on all genes, even on introns, could potentially influence the coding regions5. So, the mutations in these regions could cause potentially beneficial or harmful effects. The human APOBEC3G enzyme has been shown to play an essential role in a hostâ€™s innate immunity to viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The ligase complex plays a role in the ubiquitination of APOBEC3G enzyme, targeting it for proteolysis. In order to obtain the genotypes of the patients, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Enzymes from Life Technologies were added to degrade the membranes and nuclear envelopes of the cells in the cell pellets. After this process, only the cellâ€™s nucleic acid is left behind in the vial. Genomic DNA is isolated after RNA digestion and magnetic bead selection10. Specific enzymes hydrolyze the RNA molecules to destroy them, and then magnetic beads that respond to the charge of the DNA were added to extract the DNA from the solution. Finally, the Genomic DNA is then plated on microarrays with desiccated primers and probes placed within nanoliter reaction wells. Many nanoliter polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in a high-throughput microarray format to identify the individual SNP signatures were run. The experimenters used the Taq polymerase, which is naturally found in the thermophilic bacterial species Thermus aquaticus, because the enzyme only works in the high temperature range11. In this way, they could effectively control the amount of DNA copying by controlling the temperature. Taqpolymerase and dNTPâ€™s (nucleotides) are added to the wells in conjunction with genomic DNA. The microarrays are then subjected to multiple cycles of heating and cooling. During the heating phases, the hydrogen bonds in the DNA are broken, then as it cools, the primers that identify the desired region bind. Then, the Taq polymerase binds, and creates a complementary strand going in the direction that the primer designated. After three cycles, the desired segment of DNA is isolated, and after many more trials, many copies of this desired segment are created. The experimenters isolated the regions of DNA that contained the desired SNPs by using specific probes purchased by the laboratory. Then, the experimenters used a Biotrove OpenArray NT Cycler to capture high-resolution images of fluorescent signal. The signals (VIC and FAM) are then quantified and translated to normalized values and stored on a standard flatfile. The OpenArray SNP Genotyping Analysis Software 1.0.5 was used to analyze the clustering resulting from the aggregate signal. This program plots each individual patientâ€™s VIC or FAM signal in a scatter plot. From the plots, the experimenters determined the best-fit lines to make the best clusters. The clusters and the amount of points in the cluster showed the dominance of a certain genotype pairing according to VIC and FAM. Using the anonymous patient data acquired from the National Institute of Health (NIH) on differential SNPs in humans, genetic data with the patientâ€™s matching phenotypes and their HIV progression rates was compared. A comparison between the hostâ€™s genotype and the rapidity of their HIV progression was made. To look for significance between the two sets of data, a univariate analysis and multiple variable logistical analyses of the specific variables found significant in the initial univariate analysis was used12. Also, a false discovery rate (FDR) assuming independence to correct for multiple comparisons was applied to lessen the risk of obtaining a false positive correlation.

87cdb371184ef10876ab205cf437e9d578927615,Deterministic protein inference for shotgun proteomics data provides new insights into Arabidopsis pollen development and function.,"Pollen, the male gametophyte of flowering plants, represents an ideal biological system to study developmental processes, such as cell polarity, tip growth, and morphogenesis. Upon hydration, the metabolically quiescent pollen rapidly switches to an active state, exhibiting extremely fast growth. This rapid switch requires relevant proteins to be stored in the mature pollen, where they have to retain functionality in a desiccated environment. Using a shotgun proteomics approach, we unambiguously identified approximately 3500 proteins in Arabidopsis pollen, including 537 proteins that were not identified in genetic or transcriptomic studies. To generate this comprehensive reference data set, which extends the previously reported pollen proteome by a factor of 13, we developed a novel deterministic peptide classification scheme for protein inference. This generally applicable approach considers the gene model-protein sequence-protein accession relationships. It allowed us to classify and eliminate ambiguities inherently associated with any shotgun proteomics data set, to report a conservative list of protein identifications, and to seamlessly integrate data from previous transcriptomics studies. Manual validation of proteins unambiguously identified by a single, information-rich peptide enabled us to significantly reduce the false discovery rate, while keeping valuable identifications of shorter and lower abundant proteins. Bioinformatic analyses revealed a higher stability of pollen proteins compared to those of other tissues and implied a protein family of previously unknown function in vesicle trafficking.

d75f822284eba43c4f4c25193812e27ed8a202d5,Model Selection Based on FDR-Thresholding Optimizing the Area under the ROC-Curve,"We evaluate variable selection by multiple tests controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) to build a linear score for prediction of clinical outcome in high-dimensional data. Quality of prediction is assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for prediction in independent patients. Thus we try to combine both goals: prediction and controlled structure estimation. We show that the FDR-threshold which provides the ROC-curve with the largest area under the curve (AUC) varies largely over the different parameter constellations not known in advance. Hence, we investigated a new cross validation procedure based on the maximum rank correlation estimator to determine the optimal selection threshold. This procedure (i) allows choosing an appropriate selection criterion, (ii) provides an estimate of the FDR close to the true FDR and (iii) is simple and computationally feasible for rather moderate to small sample sizes. Low estimates of the cross validated AUC (the estimates generally being positively biased) and large estimates of the cross validated FDR may indicate a lack of sufficiently prognostic variables and/or too small sample sizes.

9f00408276848828e0cc8c37e0c76e5dc9e0142f,Gene expression profile in pelvic organ prolapse.,"It was hypothesized that the processes contributing to pelvic organ prolapse (POP) may be identified by transcriptional profiling of pelvic connective tissue in conjunction with light microscopy. In order to test this, we performed a frequency-matched case-control study of women undergoing hysterectomy for POP and controls. Total RNA, extracted from uterosacral and round ligament samples used to generate labeled cRNA, was hybridized to microarrays and analyzed for the expression of 32 878 genes. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (Stanford University, CA, USA) identified differentially expressed genes used for ontoanalysis. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed results. Light microscopy confirmed the tissue type and assessed inflammatory infiltration. The analysis of 34 arrays revealed 249 differentially expressed genes with fold changes (FC) larger than 1.5 and false discovery rates < or =5.2%. Immunity and defense was the most significant biological process differentially expressed in POP. qPCR confirmed the elevated steady-state mRNA levels for four genes: interleukin-6 (FC 9.8), thrombospondin 1 (FC 3.5) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (FC 2.4) and activating transcription factor 3 (FC 2.6). Light microscopy showed all the samples were composed of fibromuscular connective tissue with no inflammatory infiltrates.

334131614292f50a252c1f008acd3a9b2fb2784c,Italian Network for Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (italiandiafn),"Diffusion datasets were corrected for motion and eddy current distortions (Smith et al., 2004) and then processed with a Spherical Deconvolution algorithm based on a damped version of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm (Dellâ€™acqua et al., 2010, Dellâ€™Acqua et al., 2013). Tractography was performed following the method described in (Catani et al., 2012). We dissected fiftyfive frontal tracts including U-shaped fibers. For each dissection FA (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996) and hindrance modulated oriented anisotropy (HMOA) (Dellâ€™Acqua et al., 2013) were extracted as an indirect measure of the tract integrity and correlated with the age of the participants regressing out the level of education. P values are presented after false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons (* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.01 ; *** p < 0.001). Results: Aging was significantly associated with a decrease of FA (r1â„4 0.501*) and OA (r1â„4 0.508**) in the frontal projections of the corpus callosum. Aging was also associated with a decrease of OA in the right frontal lobe including the SLF I (r 1â„4 0.401**) and SLF III (r 1â„4 0.576***) branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (r 1â„4 0.331*), fronto-thalamic projections (r 1â„4 0.515***). In the left hemisphere, OA measure also decreased with aging for the frontal inferior longitudinal fasciculus (r1â„4 0.542***) and the frontal orbito-polar tract (r 1â„4 0.542***). Results are summarized in Figure 1. Conclusions: We confirmed preliminary evidences reporting reduced integrity in the frontal portion of the corpus callosum associated with aging (Lebel et al., 2010). This commissural decline may explain the increased reaction times associated with aging reported in tasks requiring interhemispheric transfer (Reuter-Lorenz and Stanczak, 2000).

4b54b402f135d96caba9c04659765f629cc7400b,Genetic risk for myocardial infarction in Japanese individuals with or without chronic kidney disease.,"Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), genetic factors underlying predisposition to MI in individuals with or without CKD remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to MI in individuals with or without CKD in order to allow prediction of genetic risk for such individuals separately. The study population comprised a total of 4344 individuals, including 1247 individuals with CKD (506 subjects with MI and 741 controls) and 3097 individuals without CKD (833 subjects with MI and 2264 controls). The 150 polymorphisms examined in this study were selected by genome-wide association studies of ischemic stroke and MI with the use of the GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set (Affymetrix) and determined by a method that combines the polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology. In individuals with CKD, no polymorphism was significantly related to MI. In individuals without CKD, an initial screen by the Chi-square test revealed that the Cyright curved arrow T polymorphism of CLEC16A (rs9925481) and the Aright curved arrow G polymorphism of LAMA3 (rs12373237) were significantly (false discovery rate for allele frequencies of <0.05) associated with MI. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis with adjustment for covariates revealed that the Cright curved arrow T polymorphism of CLEC16A (dominant model; P=0.0003; odds ratio, 0.66) and the Aright curved arrow G polymorphism of LAMA3 (recessive model; P=0.0087; odds ratio, 0.75) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with MI. A stepwise forward selection procedure also revealed that these polymorphisms were significant and independent determinants of MI. CLEC16A and LAMA3 may be susceptibility loci for MI in Japanese individuals without CKD. Determination of genotypes for CLEC16A and LAMA3 may prove informative for assessment of the genetic risk for MI in such individuals.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Tetsuo Fujimaki"", ids = ""49996701""); list(name = ""Kimihiko Kato"", ids = ""34743278""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Yokoi"", ids = ""2332668""); list(name = ""Tetsuro Yoshida"", ids = ""9796442""); list(name = ""Mitsutoshi Oguri"", ids = ""5005355""); list(name = ""Sachiro Watanabe"", ids = ""66974556""); list(name = ""Norifumi Metoki"", ids = ""6157218""); list(name = ""Hidemi Yoshida"", ids = ""35118819""); list(name = ""Kei Satoh"", ids = ""49245021""); list(name = ""Yukitoshi Aoyagi"", ids = ""5446851""); list(name = ""Yoshinori Nozawa"", ids = ""3526189""); list(name = ""Yoshiji Yamada"", ids = ""34197711"")",ff80ffa54bf3d34283aa7f509e9dea959de56bb4,15428b611f4dc565b437064d6d67ac0dfdc439e8; 597dce7708aa6dfebd62345b0a1db996295ddb57; bbf42bb561172d47ed152a05fd38783e95b77684; bcf9ee127ada1eecc6a6a874464b55462a1f6bbc; daa7e117492266abb0600ff56f13ae1a57b765d9; 608fc6bd5c16ed5ceb6eb978c2301ba2e03cfbf7; 5b6ecc2a13826ebdf9d4dc149d81419a8fb9ad99; 1572a03e619648ff016d6497ea25597a21484a5f; e3f29f25ee82aaea8cb61ce360d57bfb03409a18; 3b0528b12ad9da2c5f4eef0050539a1c96950210; 9693ef210e0de62447ae0982112ec38c69b558c5; cd8e19de7b4465a09c7a93ceebed10f6f3d0c278; bcb3dc2f6fb4c29a90fc711c61ce9f042f3e6171; 258d0052851edfd6a7425555ab4d7acaf6afd57f; 307ed4f7a97b5f8c6365a1e5eb932073709738fe; cb6614a033c4044a8aca23e41ece022bc1476a77; 26490d36ddf87e9eccf37f25bc943c61b1474beb; 4b669b0394c7408b79ec0198822554cd5c6a9ae0; c6c5bbe025441bb878530bbd85db55cb110ef15a; 9b37b643102420d4f3f6970383eed206b68d96d4; e63297b87e2120d8c2dbf530be4f01d2c1a8606e; 65b9993059c5f6baa2b919bb3b3e0f6976299d20; 19186823db1e0218577ccee7f6fadb062f3ff0df; 423df7d78cd7e556c7e7ef351a9081aa80496668; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4406a4ea9cc265888f75d36d942f0af6c28c8244; 1ba494ceb331a9a56331a5e3021bb855307ef348; f306752069740c58dbef9cd2349421aa33c961db; 5cd552e82a295470878e47993fb0f53251c36ef3; 04e7ee38f90942bc51ca7a6f09ffd37bdd867c2e; 5aaafa212640191412c214f54eb5e044599f05ba; 7580de09a0b98c4309090f6988d963d7c8c1fc9d; cbef6415c4346a6294db1c110e7484082986ea27; bae217599597786c3925088435eefbda24970706; 8edf367bbee5089e0ecb8b267eeec385c0066eb1; 53f8909d0216f0c24b9e54da745765d6f91cb369; fe3739e41d878342a6dc8616b0182970c4044bdd,International journal of molecular medicine,25 5,"

4fd99f5ed46e96e90d79c5e93e4c68156d1482af,Instance-Based Classification through Hypothesis Testing,"Classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning and data mining. During the past decades, numerous classification methods have been presented based on different principles. However, most existing classifiers cast the classification problem as an optimization problem and do not address the issue of statistical significance. In this paper, we formulate the binary classification problem as a two-sample testing problem. More precisely, our classification model is a generic framework that is composed of two steps. In the first step, the distance between the test instance and each training instance is calculated to derive two distance sets. In the second step, the two-sample test is performed under the null hypothesis that the two sets of distances are drawn from the same cumulative distribution. After these two steps, we have two p-values for each test instance and the test instance is assigned to the class associated with the smaller p-value. Essentially, the presented classification method can be regarded as an instance-based classifier based on hypothesis testing. The experimental results on 40 real data sets show that our method is able to achieve the same level performance as the state-of-the-art classifiers and has significantly better performance than existing testing-based classifiers. Furthermore, we can handle outlying instances and control the false discovery rate of test instances assigned to each class under the same framework.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Zengyou He"", ids = ""10231415""); list(name = ""Chaohua Sheng"", ids = ""51173066""); list(name = ""Yan Liu"", ids = ""39798487""); list(name = ""Quan Zou"", ids = ""144268947"")",,31f3d458bb6ad5f6ed6184cb9e1b1a111aa2714c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c99d58788d1875020e476a984890da21e1b07e44; 8d714eb3d004a8a5f8981e246d5098fabdcf9a3a; bba55a61e9b33325a9ddd4a889d2c476facf131d; 7fed3e00be2bb09510f5f7cad7ac106e6c94a359; 1a904d4b93e90b0e538e6df96774a46017bf1d96; 6c0f5caa5dc9a1f18b0c5203b102672775ea65ba; 52b7bf3ba59b31f362aa07f957f1543a29a4279e; 22268e6aa3e3fa52ffe95719d4ff26cb482e1481; fc07429b6e355aa3519364d4b89c2c3c5d3c0c5a; 757628481a4bddecd0b7bc63ecb5946f31a20f37; 60f788264e6278374be9dabd8e2a644cc65129b6; 8c18aac3a5207bb98ce80d106f449128fdc6cd55; 0efb841403aa6252b39ae6975c1cc5410554ef7b; 0345aa6780b7daf1f04698d8fe64f5aae9e0233a; 3cec9d5985b7a743187d6a277d8a2c59f5629396; a83d6476bd25c3cc1cbfb89eab245a8fa895ece8; e684db8ae852e3d5206dbfb066a656d0208f5601; 0f4fa82e162f7691ee1d35e72df4b929e23cb18f; fbca1824c49e02da37e5e780eaf0ab6ddfaf5614; 5b174e6c21016d12bdb5d62d69156404dac74dcd; 2c47bd8bd699914e3535292b17ba46542800845c; b56961fae32db677a2556b998663c0bcbfd2b490; 13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 252858d6663b30f0808280986fa6e2ee28ad0eb4,ArXiv,abs/1901.00560,
a6b216667b61c0c731ade27aa70f5701c6794d12,Abstract 4159: Expression of miRNAs associated with DNA repair capacity in women with breast cancer.,"Proceedings: AACR 104th Annual Meeting 2013; Apr 6-10, 2013; Washington, DC

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous, short (19-24 nucleotides) non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level via binding to 3â€²-untranslated regions of protein-coding transcripts. A low DNA repair capacity (DRC) is an important risk factor for breast cancer (BC). We are currently investigating whether miRNAs expression is associated with dysregulation of DRC in women with BC. To that effect, we obtained plasma from 30 BC cases and 30 controls selected based on their DRC levels. DRC was measured in lymphocytes using a host cell reactivation assay. Samples were analyzed for miRNA expression utilizing protocols from Applied Biosystems (Life Technologies). After QA/QC, 27 BC cases and 29 controls whose DRC data was available from our cohort study were selected and miRNAs isolated from plasma. The miRNA expression profiling was performed utilizing the RT-PCR TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A Cards v 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 200 ng of total RNA in 8 Multiplex RT primer pool reactions containing stem-looped RT primers that were specific to mature miRNAs. U6 snRNA-001973 was selected for normalization based on our own experimental validations. To quantify the association of the miRNA expression the fold change () was estimated for every detector with the p-values based on the t-test. Significant candidate miRNAs were determined with the false discovery rate of 4%. The results showed that twelve miRNAs are underexpressed in patients with BC relative to controls. These candidate miRNAs were associated with the expression of twenty seven DNA repair genes. Two of these genes (RPA3, MMS19L) are part of the NER pathway which has recently been linked to breast carcinogenesis. Our pilot study data suggests that differential expression of some miRNAs might be associated with dysregulation of DRC in women with BC.

0e9dd9fa4582b49538fbc1b125a519e85b3ca13b,Molecular basis of regulatory variation at coronary heart disease associated loci,"Genome-wide association studies have identified 46 replicated genetic loci for coronary heart disease (CHD), and 104 loci associated at a 5% false discovery rate. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these associations largely remain elusive. Given that the majority of these CHD-associated loci reside in non-coding regions, they are predicted to function via context-specific gene regulation. Recent high-throughput assays of regulatory function include the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq). ATAC-seq utilizes a Tn5 transposase to fragment and tag accessible DNA sequences, which are often coupled to transcription factor occupancy identified by ChIP-seq. Importantly, this assay may reveal the spatio-temporal regulatory profiles in limited numbers of primary cells. Using ATAC-seq in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) we identified 147,173 accessible chromatin peaks in control versus 198,976 peaks in TG...",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Clint L.

3b4e60484f47f5bef0b9b7f03f119521f71727e6,Genome wide association study: searching for genes underlying body mass index in the Chinese.,"OBJECTIVE
Obesity is becoming a worldwide health problem. The genome wide association (GWA) study particularly for body mass index (BMI) has not been successfully conducted in the Chinese. In order to identify novel genes for BMI variation in the Chinese, an initial GWA study and a follow up replication study were performed.


METHODS
Affymetrix 500K SNPs were genotyped for initial GWA of 597 Northern Chinese. After quality control, 281,533 SNPs were included in the association analysis. Three SNPs were genotyped in a Southern Chinese replication sample containing 2 955 Chinese Han subjects. Association analyses were performed by Plink software.


RESULTS
Eight SNPs were significantly associated with BMI variation after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (P=5.45Ã—10â»â·-7.26Ã—10â»â¶, FDR q=0.033-0.048). Two adjacent SNPs (rs4432245 & rs711906) in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) gene were significantly associated with BMI (P=6.38Ã—10â»â¶ & 4.39Ã—10â»â¶, FDR q=0.048). In the follow-up replication study, we confirmed the associations between BMI and rs4432245, rs711906 in the EIF2AKE gene (P=0.03 & 0.01, respectively).


CONCLUSION
Our study suggests novel mechanisms for BMI, where EIF2AK4 has exerted a profound effect on the synthesis and storage of triglycerides and may impact on overall energy homeostasis associated with obesity. The minor allele frequencies for the two SNPs in the EIF2AK4 gene have marked ethnic differences between Caucasians and the Chinese. The association of the EIF2AK4 gene with BMI is suggested to be 'ethnic specific' in the Chinese.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fang Yang"", ids = ""144786908""); list(name = ""Xiang Chen"", ids = ""39824805""); list(name = ""Li Jun Tan"", ids = ""48327647""); list(name = ""Jie Shen"", ids = ""144539952""); list(name = ""Ding You Li"", ids = ""153216893""); list(name = ""Fang Zhang"", ids = ""50212930""); list(name = ""Bao Yong Sha"", ids = ""12956550""); list(name = ""Hong Wen Deng"", ids = ""145869034"")",fc922b63799cc089198ca3dd7f18e928d27c70a3; f3f37a003fae7b17a63114de6f25d8c753b1912d,,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,27 5,"

6add24accb15d41dadd5fe4414e72d822f3ee8e0,Abstract 2558: miRNA-related gene variants and prostate cancer aggressiveness and recurrence.,"Introduction: miRNA expression has been correlated with prostate cancer aggressive and recurrence. However, the role of miRNA-related gene variants in prostate cancer aggressiveness and recurrence has not been adequately studied. In this study, we evaluated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA-related genes and prostate cancer aggressiveness and recurrence. Methods: We conducted a two-stage (discovery and replication) analysis of 136 miRNA-related gene variants (in 18 genes) in aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer cases. A discovery dataset of 437 aggressive and 603 non-aggressive cases was derived from a historical cohort of prostate cancer cases treated at the Moffitt Cancer Center from 1987 to 2003. A replication set of 659 aggressive and 492 non-aggressive cases was derived from existing genome-wide association data from Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS). In both datasets, patients with a Gleason score > 7 or stage > III were considered to have aggressive disease and all other patients were categorized as non-aggressive. Associations between SNPs and aggressive disease were evaluated using unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). We also evaluated the associations between SNPs and recurrence-free survival using Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95%CI among 245 recurrent and 979 non-recurrent cases. We calculated q-values to estimate false discovery rates in the analysis of recurrence. Results: For the analysis of aggressiveness, ten SNPs in seven genes (EIF2C2 [rs7009635, rs2280833 and rs13276958], FMR1 [rs28282], GEMIN4 [rs2291779], LIN28B [rs1149280], PIWIL1 [rs1106042], RAN [rs14035] and XPO5 [rs7752811, rs7748977] were significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer in the discovery dataset. Five of the 10 significant SNPs had data available in the replication dataset, but none of them was statistical significant in this dataset. For the analysis of recurrence, a total of 13 SNPs in seven genes were associated with recurrence-free survival (P-values Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that variants in miRNA-related genes may influence prostate cancer recurrence, but not aggressiveness. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Citation Format: Ernest K. Amankwah, Hui-Yi Lin, Hyun Park, Selina Radlein, Julio Pow-Sang, Ardeshir Hakam, Ya-Yu Tsai, Jong Y.

Although seminiferous tubule thickness correlates to the likelihood of sperm retrieval, optimal sperm retrieval is limited by difficulty distinguishing the widest tubules. This study utilized a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) to identify wide tubules in a rodent ASD model as a potential augmentative device for surgical sperm extraction. METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats (n=24) were implanted with testosterone filled (n=12) and empty (n = 12) silastic tubing. After a 6-8 week incubation period, Micro-TESE was performed on the rats and video-recorded. Images were annotated for blood vessels, surgical tools, and tubules by size. Annotations were reviewed by four experienced urologists for consensus. An R-CNN was trained on the annotated images and 12 images were used for validation. The model predictions on validation images were analyzed by the same four urologists for consensus. RESULTS: Concordance between expert and model predictions (PPV) was 89%. Considering expert predictions as the gold-standard, the model false discovery rate was 11% and false negative rate was 17%. Sensitivity was 83%, and accuracy was 75%. CONCLUSIONS: This model is a promising preliminary step towards incorporating augmentative neural network algorithms into intraoperative surgical imaging. Compared to the gold standard expert opinion, sensitivity and PPV were satisfactory. Further research is needed in order to optimize tubule identification and sperm retrieval during Micro-TESE.

2c2577b8fe51632875858a80be4105be0e2fe599,Genetic mechanisms regulating the host response during mastitis.,"Mastitis is a very costly and common disease in the dairy industry. The study of the transcriptome from healthy and mastitic milk somatic cell samples using RNA-Sequencing technology can provide measurements of transcript levels associated with the immune response to the infection. The objective of this study was to characterize the Holstein milk somatic cell transcriptome from 6 cows to determine host response to intramammary infections. The RNA-Sequencing was performed on 2 samples from each cow from 2 separate quarters, one classified as healthy (n = 6) and one as mastitic (n = 6). In total, 449 genes were differentially expressed between the healthy and mastitic quarters (false discovery rate <0.05, fold change >Â±2). Among the differentially expressed genes, the most expressed genes based on reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) in the healthy group were associated with milk components (CSN2 and CSN3), and in the mastitic group they were associated with immunity (B2M and CD74). In silico functional analysis was performed using the list of 449 differentially expressed genes, which identified 36 significantly enriched metabolic pathways (false discovery rate <0.01), some of which were associated with the immune system, such as cytokine-cytokine interaction and cell adhesion molecules. Seven functional candidate genes were selected, based on the criteria of being highly differentially expressed between healthy and mastitic groups and significantly enriched in metabolic pathways that are relevant to the inflammatory process (GLYCAM1, B2M, CD74, BoLA-DRA, FCER1G, SDS, and NFKBIA). Last, we identified the differentially expressed genes that are located in quantitative trait locus regions previously known to be associated with mastitis, specifically clinical mastitis, somatic cell count, and somatic cell score. It was concluded that multiple genes within quantitative trait locus regions could potentially affect host response to mastitis-causing agents, making some cows more susceptible to intramammary infections. The identification of potential candidate genes with functional, statistical, biological, and positional relevance associated with host defense to infection will contribute to a better understanding of the underlying genetic architecture associated with mastitis. This in turn will improve the sustainability of agricultural practices by facilitating the selection of cows with improved host defense leading to increased resistance to mastitis.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Victoria Asselstine"", ids = ""27055555""); list(name = ""Filippo Miglior"", ids = ""90563681""); list(name = ""Aroa SuÃ¡rez-Vega"", ids = ""1399388019""); list(name = ""Pablo Fonseca"", ids = ""40211740""); list(name = ""Bonnie A.

Current prognostic gene signatures for breast cancer mainly reflect proliferation status and have limited value in triple-negative (TNBC) cancers. The identification of prognostic signatures from TNBC cohorts was limited in the past due to small sample sizes.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We assembled all currently publically available TNBC gene expression datasets generated on Affymetrix gene chips. Inter-laboratory variation was minimized by filtering methods for both samples and genes. Supervised analysis was performed to identify prognostic signatures from 394 cases which were subsequently tested on an independent validation cohort (nâ€Š=â€Š261 cases).


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
Using two distinct false discovery rate thresholds, 25% and <3.5%, a larger (nâ€Š=â€Š264 probesets) and a smaller (nâ€Š=â€Š26 probesets) prognostic gene sets were identified and used as prognostic predictors. Most of these genes were positively associated with poor prognosis and correlated to metagenes for inflammation and angiogenesis. No correlation to other previously published prognostic signatures (recurrence score, genomic grade index, 70-gene signature, wound response signature, 7-gene immune response module, stroma derived prognostic predictor, and a medullary like signature) was observed. In multivariate analyses in the validation cohort the two signatures showed hazard ratios of 4.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-9.48; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001) and 4.08 (95% CI 1.79-9.28; Pâ€Š=â€Š0.001), respectively. The 10-year event-free survival was 70% for the good risk and 20% for the high risk group. The 26-gene signatures had modest predictive value (AUCâ€Š=â€Š0.588) to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, the combination of a B-cell metagene with the prognostic signatures increased its response predictive value. We identified a 264-gene prognostic signature for TNBC which is unrelated to previously known prognostic signatures.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Karn"", ids = ""2354221""); list(name = ""Lajos Pusztai"", ids = ""2467239""); list(name = ""Uwe Holtrich"", ids = ""4440653""); list(name = ""Takayuki Iwamoto"", ids = ""46381518""); list(name = ""Christine Y.

dd33c9b1e3c25eb99d6de5d617bb1049f7a30771,Estimating the Arm-Wise False Discovery Rate in Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization Experiments,"Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is an array-based technology which provides simultaneous spot assays of relative genetic abundance (RGA) levels at multiple sites across the genome. These spot assays are spatially correlated with respect to genomic location and, as a result, the univariate tests conducted using data generated from these spot assays are also spatially correlated. In the context of multiple hypothesis testing, this spatial correlation complicates the question of how best to define a `discovery' and consequently, how best to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) corresponding to a given rejection region.One can quantify the number of discoveries as the total number of spots for which the spot-based univariate test statistic falls within a given rejection region. Under this spot-based method, separate but correlated discoveries are identified. We show via a simulation study that the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) can provide a reasonable estimate of the spot-wise FDR, but these results require that the simulated spot assays are categorized as true or false discoveries in a particular way. However, laboratory researchers may actually be interested in estimating a `regional' FDR, rather than a `local' spot-wise FDR. We describe an example of such circumstances, and present a method for estimating the (chromosome) arm-wise False Discovery Rate. In this framework, one can quantify the number of discoveries as the total number of chromosome arms for which at least one spot-based test statistic falls into a given rejection region. Defining the discoveries in this way, both the biological and testing objectives coincide. We provide results from a series of simulations which involved the analysis of preferentially re-sampled spot assay values from a real aCGH dataset.",2007,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel P.

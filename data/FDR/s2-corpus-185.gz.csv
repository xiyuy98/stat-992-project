81ec5b0eb4d9df0a8efd10458aa9584e2c0629d7,Clinical utility of ABCB1 genotyping for preventing toxicity in treatment with irinotecan,"ABSTRACT Preventing severe irinotecanâ€induced adverse reactions would allow us to offer better treatment and improve patientsâ€™ quality of life. Transporters, metabolizing enzymes, and genes involved in the folate pathway have been associated with irinotecanâ€induced toxicity. We analyzed 12 polymorphisms in UGT1A1, ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC4, ABCC5, and MTHFR in 158 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan and studied the association with grade >2 adverse reactions (CTCAE). Among the most frequent ADRs, the SNPs rs1128503, rs2032582, and rs1045642 in ABCB1 and rs1801133 in MTHFR were associated with hematological toxicity and overall toxicity. The SNP rs11568678 in ABCC4 was also associated with overall toxicity. After correction of P values using a false discovery rate, only ABCB1 variants remained statistically significant. Haplotype analysis in ABCB1 showed an 11.3â€fold and 4.6â€fold increased risk of hematological toxicity (95% CI, 1.459â€“88.622) and overall toxicity (95% CI, 2.283â€“9.386), respectively. Consequently, genotyping of the three SNPs in ABCB1 can predict overall toxicity and hematological toxicity with a diagnostic odds ratio of 4.40 and 9.94, respectively. Genotyping of ABCB1 variants can help to prevent severe adverse reactions to irinotecanâ€based treatments in colorectal cancer.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sara Salvador-MartÃ­n"", ids = ""1404401838""); list(name = ""Xandra GarcÃ­aâ\200\220GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""1402586928""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Isabel MartÃ­nez GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""22256005""); list(name = ""Carolina Blanco"", ids = ""145802945""); list(name = ""Pilar GarcÃ­aâ\200\220Alfonso"", ids = ""1403329755""); list(name = ""Luis Quintanar Robles"", ids = ""39511280""); list(name = ""C GrÃ¡valos"", ids = ""6650380""); list(name = ""Vanessa PachÃ³n"", ids = ""7763969""); list(name = ""Federico Longo"", ids = ""144337599""); list(name = ""Virginia MartÃ­nez"", ids = ""144499319""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a Sanjurjo-SÃ¡ez"", ids = ""102001960""); list(name = ""Luis A LÃ³pez-FernÃ¡ndez"", ids = ""1398469148"")",bfb64819ec8ccb7e7469649f215620dda0861e56,050a9c87b08f9c1f871141e0db9e094b1f67bbbd; 1ec77d450397be536cb71e4d0824008ec8424ab4; 4f0ece0b66b2ae031f8f760f41a9c0b2c396ace9; 950bb724db08b009e6305157ac21b484cd2771fe; 444537108d9171272bfbb0eccd7a3855ada66b0d; d637ce78734d3b9648cfed1d679add75afe2fd56; 6e25509a4dcee4b62c400c9b715dbc0275b9122c; e1ac416daa523057ed8fdcb501eca4bac10e524d; a7df0e21f70a655ac5863b4bb643cbab166ce94f; f3486c44b0f4978f60a81b04927d560f28a4d789; 91c7f553b1cb33e17abb75202c8dd63344faf1d4; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; 2b0b95427efa4029afb40ca9bdbee8140b377ce6; a2398a95f50b3b7519e4feb9d483ae1b0a5f0435; b74b21bcde8c23c8ded000a4d25ad19f7fdefa46; 3af483c65970cd85fb5e04f8d0ea25d168505e94; 5fcec640f2260a6d0a4c37fb4bf3b76a5f7235c7; f655ea9ca48d753a18908d922466868fc25525be; e3f1ac6081cfa0f3971a94c283582051aff4c40d; b17f990f516a1e9df5964124b8b1b402e7ef0e67; 1a7ce49dc292e2fa3f2c624ff5af7a0d2b7dcae4; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; affd1dee2c682e3da51ba2e5f348ec027f9acdbb; 0be2acd403746056d71f5a2c89c440100bd9127b; 497c6f31e97cf02b48c6e7ee4e06be754ff9dbb8; 1b9e8d44a9348d1853ad61308d9f4b1ace43b506; ade3d243ddecb1f249d9c840f12ba891759ede16; 706d21670540776f3d268be5de59483ec3ef24b9; 155b4fe0343ab9f69ab6a7a7554ba22c2118fdfd; 72a7ee892e4be99ee8bb4e932d1938d044b48af4; eea21ab8f91c0012bf8499c2649fd1b914633a57; f377a6a409dbc8deff6b12e26c6fa8aeb16cb8e1; 138f30fe4b49fdd7eaa7f32a400bf7198074c238; 0d78b9e5b5b72870c229a874f5d7a4f8ac5bcd86; d8e67b7d7e5ecae4694e8b95a706ea40b0a87ce8; 00ecc14538c074d57f52b9fc877aa9e2a2421c81; a6dff41fc06f487fb885b6b8a020618bcb37ca87; 031a942bfcd58fee74ef40ab44a85ec1cf51bfc8; 9f327b13992ac5efff23c1869f7bd5f51efab07d; 044658ead3fe5730abbc7cde18fdc2bbe09d3abf; c596a44e001caff546301c355054ccbc5213a24d; f95ece0da4d6e423e724f2cb91d0422264e62463; 7dff90829768c9e1b07368d30d64c7c4a246d43f; e7e85913c6b901c666679e229bee0cbe8165376d; 523d8aa0aae3239b82a499562c0696118edf67d3; 281fe8f2221a8c7e0b1c3336ae37ec1df5c93689; ac6804a59aa6d540896844cc699949be8056ee73,Pharmacological Research,136,133â€“139
a77031db15da51114bae7f1b972ca255994f0677,All SNPs Are Not Created Equal: Genome-Wide Association Studies Reveal a Consistent Pattern of Enrichment among Functionally Annotated SNPs,"Recent results indicate that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to explain much of the heritability of common complex phenotypes, but methods are lacking to reliably identify the remaining associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We applied stratified False Discovery Rate (sFDR) methods to leverage genic enrichment in GWAS summary statistics data to uncover new loci likely to replicate in independent samples. Specifically, we use linkage disequilibrium-weighted annotations for each SNP in combination with nominal p-values to estimate the True Discovery Rate (TDR = 1-FDR) for strata determined by different genic categories. We show a consistent pattern of enrichment of polygenic effects in specific annotation categories across diverse phenotypes, with the greatest enrichment for SNPs tagging regulatory and coding genic elements, little enrichment in introns, and negative enrichment for intergenic SNPs. Stratified enrichment directly leads to increased TDR for a given p-value, mirrored by increased replication rates in independent samples. We show this in independent Crohn's disease GWAS, where we find a hundredfold variation in replication rate across genic categories. Applying a well-established sFDR methodology we demonstrate the utility of stratification for improving power of GWAS in complex phenotypes, with increased rejection rates from 20% in height to 300% in schizophrenia with traditional FDR and sFDR both fixed at 0.05. Our analyses demonstrate an inherent stratification among GWAS SNPs with important conceptual implications that can be leveraged by statistical methods to improve the discovery of loci.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Andrew J.

86a52078aa71a77544fc6d3700d822d5ecd1e724,Abstract 5010: Differences in DNA methylation between the African and European HapMap populations,"Background: DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene transcription, and the genome-wide landscape of DNA methylation is altered in cancer: hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes as well as hypomethylation of repetitive elements and target genes can contribute to cancer initiation and progression. As a complex trait itself, there is considerable inter-individual and inter-ethnic variability in DNA methylation patterns. To further explore the baseline variation of DNA methylation and its regulation, we have gathered genome-wide DNA methylation data on individual CpG methylation sites in a collection of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the HapMap Project. Methods: We profiled DNA methylation in 73 unrelated African (YRI - Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) and 60 European ancestry (CEU - Caucasians from Utah, US) LCLs using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip. This chip interrogates >485,000 CpG methylation sites per sample at single-nucleotide resolution and assigns each site an average beta value for methylation level. We controlled for potential batch effect due to array hybridization using COMBAT and removed probes that contained known SNPs or mapped ambiguously to the reference genome. In our final analysis dataset, we included 46,236 probes on autosomes that showed relatively high variation (top 25% percentile) across the LCL samples based on coefficient of variation. The Wilcox rank sum test was performed to identify differential methylation sites between the YRI and CEU samples. Results: In total, 988 CpG probes (708 genes) were found to be differentially methylated between these two populations (p âˆ’6 , false discovery rate âˆ’4 ). The differentially methylated sites were enriched in pathways and Gene Ontology terms such as â€œcell adhesion,â€ â€œECM-receptor interaction,â€ and pathways involved in development such as WNT and Hedgehog. Conclusions: A substantial number of CpG methylation sites were differentially methylated between individuals of African and European ancestry. These differentially methylated CpG sites appeared to be enriched in certain genomic regions and pathways. Future integration of this dataset with other available resources of these samples (e.g., genotypes, mRNA expression) will help elucidate the complex networks of genetic and epigenetic regulation (e.g., through modified cytosine quantitative trait loci, mQTLs), and their contribution to complex traits, such as drug response.

357d788c057c20d2d2147ebb010412cb094f5462,Mapping novel immunogenic epitopes in IgA nephropathy.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
IgA plays a key role in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) by forming immune complexes and depositing in the glomeruli, leading to an inflammatory response. However, the antigenic targets and functional characterization of IgA have been incompletely defined in this disease.


DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS
This study was performed in sera from patients who were studied as part of a prospective, observational study of IgAN. These patients (n=22) all had biopsy-proven IgAN within 3 years of study initiation, complete clinical data, annual urinary inulin clearance for GFRs, and at least 5 years of follow-up. Progression was defined as loss of >5 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year of inulin clearance measured over at least 5 years. A protein microarray was used for detection of IgAN-specific IgA autoantibodies in blood across approximately 9000 human antigens to specifically identify the most immunogenic protein targets that drive IgA antibodies in IgAN (n=22), healthy controls (n=10), and non-IgAN glomerular diseases (n=17). Results were validated by ELISA assays in sera and by immunohistochemistry in IgAN kidney biopsies. IgA-specific antibodies were correlated with clinical and histologic variables to assess their effect on disease progression and prognosis.


RESULTS
Fifty-four proteins mounted highly significant IgA antibody responses in patients with IgAN with a false discovery rate (q value) of â‰¤10%; 325 antibodies (Pâ‰¤0.05) were increased overall. Antitissue transglutaminase IgA was significantly elevated in IgAN (P<0.001, q value of 0%). IgA antibodies to DDX4 (r=-0.55, P=0.01) and ZADH2 (r=-0.48, P=0.02) were significantly correlated with the decline of renal function. Specific IgA autoantibodies are elevated in IgAN compared with normal participants and those with other glomerular diseases.


CONCLUSIONS
In this preliminary study, IgA autoantibodies target novel proteins, highly expressed in the kidney glomerulus and tubules. These IgA autoantibodies may play important roles in the pathogenesis of IgAN.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sang Hoon Woo"", ids = ""2659617""); list(name = ""Tara K.

74248f0c1fe6b63ee463af44c330896a672ffe1a,Can hospital rounds with pocket ultrasound by cardiologists reduce standard echocardiography?,"BACKGROUND
Frequently, hospitalized patients are referred for transthoracic echocardiograms. The availability of a pocket mobile echocardiography device that can be incorporated on bedside rounds by cardiologists may be a useful and frugal alternative.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional study designed to compare the accuracy of pocket mobile echocardiography images with those acquired by transthoracic echocardiography in a sample of hospitalized patients. Each patient referred for echocardiography underwent pocket mobile echocardiography acquisition and interpretation by a senior cardiology fellow with level II training in echocardiography. Subsequently, transthoracic echocardiography was performed by skilled ultrasonographers and interpreted by experienced echocardiographers. Both groups were blinded to the results of the alternative imaging modality. Visualizability and accuracy for all key echocardiographic parameters (ejection fraction, wall motion abnormalities, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, inferior vena cava size, aortic and mitral valve pathology, and pericardial effusion) were determined and compared between imaging modalities.


RESULTS
A total of 240 hospitalized patients underwent echocardiography with pocket mobile echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography. The mean age was 71 Â± 17 years. Pocket mobile echocardiography imaging time was 6.3 Â± 1.5 minutes. Sensitivity of pocket mobile echocardiography varied by parameter and was highest for aortic stenosis (97%) and lowest for aortic insufficiency (76%). Specificity also varied by parameter and was highest for mitral regurgitation (100%) and lowest for left ventricular ejection fraction (92%). Equivalence testing revealed the pocket mobile echocardiography outcomes to be significantly equivalent to the transthoracic echocardiography outcomes with no discernible differences in image quality between pocket mobile echocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography (P = 7.22 Ã— 10(-7)). All outcomes remain significant after correcting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate.


CONCLUSIONS
The results from rapid bedside pocket mobile echocardiography examinations performed by experienced cardiology fellows compared favorably with those from formal transthoracic echocardiography studies. For hospitalized patients, this finding could shift the burden of performing and interpreting the echocardiogram to the examining physician and reduce the number and cost associated with formal echocardiography studies.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hashim A Khan"", ids = ""47224358""); list(name = ""Nathan E Wineinger"", ids = ""3287780""); list(name = ""Poulina Q.

c502db8e9e8d11d47d4e298919462af5a14a0e5b,Dental Informatics to Characterize Patients with Dentofacial Deformities,"Relevant statistical modeling and analysis of dental data can improve diagnostic and treatment procedures. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the use of various data mining algorithms to characterize patients with dentofacial deformities. A total of 72 patients with skeletal malocclusions who had completed orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatments were examined. Each patient was characterized by 22 measurements related to dentofacial deformities. Clustering analysis and visualization grouped the patients into three different patterns of dentofacial deformities. A feature selection approach based on a false discovery rate was used to identify a subset of 22 measurements important in categorizing these three clusters. Finally, classification was performed to evaluate the quality of the measurements selected by the feature selection approach. The results showed that feature selection improved classification accuracy while simultaneously determining which measurements were relevant.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Seoung Bum Kim"", ids = ""144293749""); list(name = ""Jung Woo Lee"", ids = ""49684997""); list(name = ""Sin Young Kim"", ids = ""19015979""); list(name = ""Deok Won Lee"", ids = ""5709549"")",a1957b44b0cb2dbd95acafc449a39f1b7b958d1d,427078d49a6ead3fa041d726537ec7e2d3ef1525; 5c14fab5feaa45f1a3207790ffa00fb155bb531d; 6713ac5c377e0017171fdd4c0fda4e2612617053; 6bc052f89db3d9d9462ea7f8a539be531ff0339f; 56b529aa7ee95895c31a4e0dee47a6d37992c330; a2c15468dd35f0f0f11b96980d9520d0620496aa; ba4c979473b0f93e64d58356e06624b1d09c15c8; 954937ece00fd465f6a639fa739a04af8d5d7efb; f17b50f9aa5a16c3b7191c16e3725a3f2c156606; 94559c249d204110296c39ed4af2042cc4468e68; c95f81b166b5dc376dbb5202a1fb5431b4483b4a; dfa8dc739bf7625b276c402d56d1f9784e966c76; 4aa91e4a65f33b199c3bea74741128aecfffa018; 89c8179cce5887300a8b588c86cfd3e6db0b2801; d2d758b667092bb483c18cd86e661460b84386cb; fb7cb9d037117246a550db1f9507a12fff06fb3a; bc822c139edb4a04c7ab44c59570f7d121414414; a9eaf22966f9f3e7244aef88426e986b48ba8200; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 08b43d84e6747e370ef307e2ada50675b414514a; d6b870dbe8f3acd216774a248a986e8c79298ea5; 67d77bc1d8683d305377a7cfb9acd3caec154a66; cff26210b17f34a196ab00aba3da0592e1119e19; c6c2925de5f4a4f4f6aa19844a0f2b793f8bd505; f2f85ec20bcae8d67035fd446b855a75b9a0aa8d; 059bc899a99aa1a92b00b16238a277365560829f; aaf37c721f3f7d8ee001d6b6fa024521b4d6e333; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 718d6b37e72f647053c809c3fbee6d9485da1d81,PLoS ONE,8,

Although myriad independent studies have profiled the global effects of this hormone on gene expression in these cells, disparate experimental variables and the limited power of the individual studies have combined to restrict the agreement between them as to the specific gene expression signature elicited by this hormone. To address these issues, we have developed a freely accessible Web resource, Gene Expression MetaSignatures (GEMS) that provides the user a consensus for each gene in the system. We conducted a weighted meta-analysis encompassing over 13,000 genes across 10 independent published datasets addressing the effect of 17beta-estradiol on MCF-7 cells at early (3-4 hours) and late (24 hours) time points. In a literature survey of 58 genes previously shown to be regulated by 17beta-estradiol in MCF-7 cells, the meta-analysis combined the statistical power of the underlying datasets to call regulation of these genes with nearly 85% accuracy (false discovery rate-corrected P < 0.05). We anticipate that with future expression microarray dataset contributions from investigators, GEMS will evolve into an important resource for the cancer and nuclear receptor signaling communities.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Scott A Ochsner"", ids = ""39007485""); list(name = ""David L.

344bf3eeed49cb6168afca7a2fe11d9d0e783b6b,Denoising with advanced stepwise false discovery rate control and its application to fault diagnosis,"Abstract To extract defect features from the signal with background noise for fault diagnosis, a novel approach is proposed by using advanced false discovery rate procedure (AFDR). The main idea is based on controlling false discovery rate (FDR) through combination of all three stepwise procedures (step-up, step-down, step-up-down) and estimation of the number of true null hypotheses. The AFDR procedure differs from the standard FDR procedure in two respects, i.e., enhancing the efficiency by reducing the number of tested hypotheses and improving the power. The proposed procedure consists of two main steps: firstly, the signal is represented more parsimoniously in wavelet domain; secondly, a most appropriate stepwise FDR procedure is selected according to the character of wavelet coefficients. Both the numerical simulation results and the experimental results for bearing defect diagnosis show that the proposed approach is a competitive shrinkage method compared with other popular techniques.",2012,Engineering,"list(name = ""Wenliao Du"", ids = ""2691088""); list(name = ""Yanming Li"", ids = ""50025666""); list(name = ""Jin Yuan"", ids = ""144773951""); list(name = ""Chengliang Liu"", ids = ""1699591"")",58f67c792485db5f1cc46fb67dc4e9ce335d5a3c,,Measurement,45,1515-1526

RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model. In summary, this work provides a pipeline for the significance analysis of sequencing data.",2012,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jun Z. Li"", ids = ""35271154""); list(name = ""Daniela M.

d5275e3ef200bf72612c1ce5b32eb7943377013b,Heterogeneity in the Patterns of Neural Abnormality in Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Evidence from ERP and MRI,"Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a heterogeneous group of social communication problems. Research into the neural basis of ASD has revealed abnormalities in a number of different regions of the brain. However, the literature is highly inconsistent. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is differences in intelligence. Children with ASD and below average intelligence may be hypothesised to show additional or different neural abnormalities. This possibility was explored using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and event-related potentials (ERP). Two groups of children with ASD were studied, those with average or above average intelligence (high ASD group) and those with below average intelligence (low ASD group). The structural MRI data were analysed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Using the family-wise error threshold, results showed bilateral abnormality common to the two ASD groups in the cerebellum, fusiform gyrus and frontal cortex. In addition, a number of regions were found to be significantly different in the two ASD groups: regions of the cerebellum showed increased grey matter density bilaterally in the high ASD group, but decreased grey matter density bilaterally in the low ASD group. Further, compared to the high ASD group, additional bilateral abnormalities were found in the postcentral gyrus and regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the low ASD group. Using the less stringent false discovery rate (FDR) threshold, differences were also seen in the medial temporal lobes. ERPs also showed differences between the two ASD groups. Whereas the ERPs of the high ASD group were not significantly different from those of the controls, the low ASD group had delayed novelty P3a responses and reduced amplitude target P3b components. These data provide convergent ERP and MRI evidence for the heterogeneity of neural abnormality in ASD in relation to variations in intelligence.",2007,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Claire Helen Salmond"", ids = ""6177111""); list(name = ""Faraneh Vargha-Khadem"", ids = ""1397487662""); list(name = ""David G.

METHODS
Pretreatment fine needle aspirations from 21 patients with HER2 amplified, stages II-III breast cancer were available for transcriptional profiling with Affymetrix U133 A chips.


RESULTS
Overall pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was 71%. Age, nuclear grade, tumor size, nodal status or quantitative estrogen and HER2 receptor mRNA expression showed no association with response in univariate and multivariate logistic regression. We tested the accuracy of a 30-gene pCR predictor that was previously developed from patients who received T/FEC only preoperative chemotherapy. This predictor was accurate in validation in T/FEC treated patients (n=51) but showed low sensitivity in patients who also received trastuzumab (sensitivity 53% versus 92%). We could not identify any differentially expressed genes between pCR (n=15) and residual disease (RD, n=6) at a false discovery rate (FDR) <90% in the HER2 amplified trastuzumab-treated cases. Hierarchical clustering using the ""Perou intrinsic gene set"" also failed to separate pCR from RD. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with 22 genes from trastuzumab-resistant cell lines showed a modest association with RD (FDR=9%).


CONCLUSIONS
Clinical variables and pharmacogenomic predictors that predict pCR in the absence of trastuzumab are no longer accurate when trastuzumab is included in the treatment. Trastuzumab-resistance associated genes identified in vitro are also associated with resistance in vivo. Support: Ellence Foundation.

2524e471e5edcf6e2da73cbaf75e67c2164bb059,High-frequency changes during interictal spikes detected by time-frequency analysis,"OBJECTIVE
High-frequency (HF) changes were analysed in relation to anatomical origin of spikes, shape and occurrence within the seizure onset zone (SOZ). We evaluated whether HF changes are linked to the SOZ, as established for distinct high-frequency oscillations.


METHODS
SEEG was filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2000 Hz. Spikes were selected by shape (spike/spike-slow wave) and location (SOZ/non-SOZ and neocortex/amygdala/hippocampus) in 15 patients. About 50 spikes were averaged for each set. Changes compared to baseline were quantified with false discovery rate controlled t-statistics using time-frequency spectra. Counts of increased or decreased time-frequency values were compared across spike categories in the 80-250 and 250-500 Hz bands.


RESULTS
Seventy-seven spike types were analysed. Differences between spike categories were most prominent between 250 and 500 Hz. HF changes were more frequent and larger in mesial temporal than in neocortical spikes and for spikes with slow waves than spikes alone. HF changes above 250 Hz were more frequent in spikes within than outside the SOZ.


CONCLUSIONS
HF increases above 250 Hz show regional differences and are very prominent in the SOZ. Hippocampal spikes have the strongest HF components.


SIGNIFICANCE

IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (IgM-MGUS),"We performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of bone marrow (BM) CD19+ cells of WM vs. IgM-MGUS to find the genes and key pathways mostly involved in the comparison between WM and IgM-MGUS. We isolated BM CD19+ and CD138+ cells of 36 WM and 13 IgM-MGUS using Miltenyi Microbeads and we performed expression analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip HG U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Data was processed using RMA and analyzed using SAM and a false discovery rate threshold of 5% to select the differentially expressed genes. To further select a subset of robust biomarkers, SVMs were used in a Monte Carlo bootstrap resampling schema with B=100 external training/test splits to discriminate between WM and IgM-MGUS. 641 probes were selected by SAM on CD19+ cells. SVMs permitted the selection of 66 robust biomarker genes (Fig.1) with a MCC accuracy on external samples equal to 0.87. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the involvement of the following pathways: - Notch signaling pathway: ADAM17 (promoting cell growth) was upregulated while AGO1 and AGO4 (negative regulation of translation) were downregulated in WM - CAPRIN1 and SORT1 (pro-apoptosis) were underexpressed while CIAPIN1 (anti-apoptosis) was overexpressed in WM - Purine/pyrimidine metabolism (cell growth): ENTPD5 (cell proliferation) was overexpressed while NT5E (catabolic process) was underexpressed in WM - Sphingolipid pathway: ACER3, COL4A3BP, GBA3 were downregulated in WM - Rho-protein signal transduction: FARP2 (cell survival) was overexpressed in WM - Transcription: ITPRIPL2, L3MBTL4 were underexpressed while NFX1, LIMS1 (cell aging) USF1 were overexpressed in WM - Immune system: HLA-C was upregulated in WM - PRKCA was underexpressed in WM and involved in 85 pathways (MAPK-NGF-EGF-VEGF-ErbB-Ras-HIF-1-mTOR-PI3K-Akt) - MIR1204///PVT1 (oncogene), METTL3 (RNA-methylation), MINA (cell survival) were upregulated in WM As a second step of the study, we investigated 7 IgM-MGUS and 11 WM (2 symptomatic and 9 asymptomatic) newly diagnosed patients. We isolated the BM B cell clones (CD45+,CD38+,CD19+,LAIR-1-; CD27dim, IgM+, CD22dim, CD25+) using cell sorting with MoFlo XDP 3 laser cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). We identified clonally restricted B lymphocyte populations using BD LSRFortessa Flow Cytometer equipped with 5 lasers. We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) of the isolated BM cell clones of WM vs. IgM-MGUS using Affymetrix next-generation GeneChip HTA 2.0 to further investigate genomic complexity. The data was preprocessed and normalized using RMA. Selection and data analysis were performed using the t-test as implemented in the Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console. Functional enrichment analysis performed using DAVID, demonstrated that groups of genes belonging to relevant functional categories were deregulated in the comparison between WM vs. IgMMGUS: - CSH2, GH2, NTF3, NPY genes which belonged to the PI3K/Akt, JAK-STAT, MAPK pathways - CSHL1 regulating cell growth - CLDN19 involved in the cell adhesion - EIF2AK3, EIF2B4 were involved in the GSK3 signaling (cellular proliferation, migration, inflammation, immune responses, glucose regulation and apoptosis) - NPPA belonging to the HIF-1 signaling pathway In conclusion, GEP of BM CD19+ cells demonstrated that 66 genes were robust biomarkers able to distinguish between WM and IgM-MGUS. The negative regulation of translation, pro-/anti-apoptotic processes, Notch signaling pathway, Purine/Pyrimidine metabolism, Sphingolipid metabolism and the regulation of transcription were mostly involved in the comparison between WM and IgM-MGUS. On the other hand, microarray of BM B cell clones (CD45+,CD38+,CD19+,LAIR-1-; CD27dim, IgM+, CD22dim, CD25+) identified groups of genes and pathways deregulated in the comparison between WM and IgM-MGUS. No statistically significant differences of expression were identified between WM vs. IgM-MGUS after correction for multiple testing. Moreover, fold-changes of transcripts whose p-value was lower than a nominal significance level of 5% were higher than 2 (absolute value) in only 4 out of 217 cases. We could suppose that the isolated clonal B-cell populations of WM and IgM-MGUS identified by flow citometry present similar expression signatures. Ongoing experiments of GEP of BM B cell clones vs. BM CD19 depleted cells of WM as well as IgM-MGUS could clarify the gene expression profiles of WM and IgM-MGUS.

To define pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the peripheral blood of patients with Crohn's disease [CD] after treatment with PF-00547659, an anti-human mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 [MAdCAM-1] monoclonal antibody.


Methods
In this Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, controlled study [OPERA], blood samples were analysed from patients with moderate to severe active CD who received placebo or 22.5 mg, 75 mg, or 225 mg of PF-00547659 subcutaneously at baseline and at Weeks 4 and 8, with follow-up at Week 12. Soluble MAdCAM [sMAdCAM] was measured by mass spectrometry, Î²7-expressing T cells by flow cytometry, and gene transcriptome by RNA sequencing.


Results
A slight increase in sMAdCAM was measured in the placebo group from baseline to Week 12 [6%], compared with significant decreases in all PF-00547659 groups [-87% to -98%]. A slight increase from baseline to Week 12 was observed in frequency and molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome for Î²7+ central memory T cells in the placebo group [4%], versus statistically significant increases in the active treatment groups [48% to 81%]. Similar trends were seen for Î²7+ effector memory T cells [placebo, 8%; PF-00547659, 84-138%] and Î²7+ naÃ¯ve T cells [8%; 13-50%]. CCR9 gene expression had statistically significant up-regulation [p = 1.09e-06; false discovery rate < 0.1] with PF-00547659 treatment, and was associated with an increase in Î²7+ T cells.


Conclusions
Results of the OPERA study demonstrate positive pharmacology and dose-dependent changes in pharmacodynamic biomarker measurements in blood, including changes in cellular composition of lymphocytes and corresponding CCR9 gene expression changes.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mina Hassan-Zahraee"", ids = ""1399244642""); list(name = ""Anindita Banerjee"", ids = ""47997460""); list(name = ""John B.

8396fc79b650405e2222532b76d38f3b4745c8a5,Hidden Markov model in multiple testing on dependent count data,"ABSTRACT Multiple testing on dependent count data faces two basic modelling elements: the choice of distributions under the null and the non-null states and the modelling of the dependence structure across observations. A Bayesian hidden Markov model is constructed for Poisson count data to handle these two issues. The proposed Bayesian method is based on the posterior probability of the null state and exhibits the property of an optimal test procedure, which has the lowest false-negative rate with the false discovery rate under control. Furthermore, the model has either single or mixture of Poisson distributions used under the non-null state. Model selection methods are employed here to decide the number of components in the mixture. Different approaches of calculating marginal likelihood are discussed. Extensive simulation studies and a case study are employed to examine and compare a collection of commonly used testing procedures and model selection criteria.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Weizhe Su"", ids = ""31901002""); list(name = ""Xia Wang"", ids = ""1524735332"")",,f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 0f73674bd32ec999d74a1aee138ff0044448c097; 0aa8774e218fafa445a986715f5b40124b7ae6a5; 54339edf70fb5eadd89fc609546bc0f5c0a08f59; 3d4523d71179f7b4481c61b195f835439e4070c3; 950989cbd8b55ce56f2b86b5769a9e6ba393c614; ee03365c15c3d75ccd6328e943fa67c8356d916d; 15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750; e079efca326f42b0c97648ec09ea585f520758cc; a73932d368f9a4ad68fb558613fd447cba5567b2; 93ef041c254dc6bf140c9382614d8729a1f68bf7; 57dbb8c80c863d5f2a5a402c3f91fa387e0f7ae9; 0355c6a0d55538b5b591c8b8e2b1d60087c04e89; 930281f635c92fe3dee041b3e1315e606c76850e; 6d7c7112ef4fb5e938003c689e266ba41d165107; a96f85b9af623508fc5158c4f5284d2f02a027bf; b457820831cafc3b7106b4fad596f8a7a70d58ea; 1108ee35252dbf1a9111360ad0fb77cbe045dbc5; da40ef5e864348135bdcd55e3bd0a205f637af93; 019fb52509f43206993e360179035a61ca7996ee; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 157bd724ebd2f9098cb06d8c0a1321a784fc7edb; 454fcdeb33e38520b638bcd30e37415c54f781bf; c1a61ed05fb8bd960cd8b463b0caabb63ae64ea3; d78717cad16b4a2d5bec8aa68123e8ae6994cd42; 223239ff755786b055cf78c8aa943524cc836741; b5f82518b89f0e7b1a5edddbf923139030a8b011; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 928322434d68d6fbe79e095c15e87ef06dfdda8f; 0c2a04d474ccfef4085235b60d00524994cd33bc; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 43b329f879b16c17d8699c755f4ecc5d40408904; d9223c9f7bc00910c1f3e2a9fdeb86102266d310,Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,90,889 - 906
03137ab474b2cdbccad420018df642ec5e710a55,Identification of chromosome 3q28 and ALPK1 as susceptibility loci for chronic kidney disease in Japanese individuals by a genome-wide association study.,"BACKGROUND
Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have implicated several genes in the predisposition to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Caucasian or African American populations, the genes that confer susceptibility to CKD in Asian populations remain to be identified definitively. We performed a GWAS to identify genetic variants that confer susceptibility to CKD in Japanese individuals.


METHODS
3851 Japanese individuals from three independent subject panels were examined. Subject panels A, B, and C comprised 252, 910, and 190 individuals with CKD and 249, 838, and 1412 controls, respectively. A GWAS for CKD was performed in subject panel A.


RESULTS
Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosome 3q28, ALPK1, FAM78B, and UMODL1 were significantly (false discovery rate<0.05) associated with CKD by the GWAS. The relation of these five SNPs and of an additional 22 SNPs at these loci to CKD was examined in subject panel B, revealing that rs9846911 at 3q28 was significantly associated with CKD in all individuals and that rs2074381 and rs2074380 in ALPK1 were associated with CKD in individuals with diabetes mellitus. These three SNPs were further examined in subject panel C, revealing that rs2074381 and rs2074380 were significantly associated with CKD. For subject panels B and C combined, rs9846911 was significantly associated with CKD in all individuals and rs2074381 and rs2074380 were associated with CKD in diabetic individuals.

3c41b270a787c097ae205d4b3a557d0ab8180550,Transcriptome Analysis Identified Significant Differences in Gene Expression Variability Between WM and IgM-MGUS BM B Cell Clones,"In this study we focused on determining the transcriptome differences between Waldenstrom9s Macroglobulinemia (WM) and IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (IgM-MGUS) by gene expression profiling (GEP) considering all the different transcript isoforms of genes that map the human transcriptome (coding transcripts, non-coding transcripts). We performed the analysis on BM B cell clones (CD45+,CD38+,CD19+,LAIR-1-,CD27dim,IgM+,CD22dim,CD25+) from WM ( n =21) and IgM-MGUS ( n =13) patients. These populations were identified with an 8-colors panel by flow cytometry and successively isolated by cell sorting. GEP of WM vs. IgM-MGUS BM B cell clones was performed using Affymetrix Gene Chip HTA 2.0. Data was first pre-processed using Affymetrix Expression Console and then normalized using ComBat (Johnson et. al. Biostatistics2007) and quantile normalization. We investigated both differential expression using SAM test (Tusher et. al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA2001) and differential variability using F-test to compare means and variances between groups, respectively. In particular, testing the variability is useful to investigate a heterogeneous disease like Waldenstrom9s Macroglobulinemia as well as IgM-MGUS, since B clonal cells proliferation and growth are driven by different mutations acting as perturbations in different molecular pathways, and these perturbations vary from individual to individual. False Discovery Rate (FDR) p-values adjusted for multiple testing below 5% were considered significant (Storey J R Stat Soc 2002). ""Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool"" (GREAT) (McLean t. al. Nat Biotechnol 2010) was used to annotate the selected probe sets and perform biological pathway enrichment analysis. We considered 67,529 probe sets for the analyses. There were no differentially expressed probe sets in means after the correction for multiple comparisons, whereas 446 probe sets showed differential variability between IgM-MGUS and WM samples. Figure 1 shows how the selected probe sets map on the human genome according to GREAT. Enrichment analysis performed on these 446 probe sets showed after correction for multiple testing (FDR threshold set at 5%), significant enrichment for apoptosis, B cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine-signaling pathway, ERBB signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and WNT signaling pathway. Of note, BCL2, RAF1, MAPK1, GRB2, GSK3B, NRG1, SOS1, WNT5A, NLK, PTK2B genes belonging to these pathways, demonstrated significant different expression variability. We found that IgM-MGUS showed significantly increased variability of expression of all the selected genes (a part from SOS1 and NLK ) across patients. We could speculate that IgM-MGUS B cell clones showed increased expression variability in the identified genes in their developmental stage, indicating the likely presence of cells at different step of differentiation whereas the expression of the same genes was more stable in WM patients. In summary, we found that IgM-MGUS was characterized by higher variability in gene expression across patients, which could be related to higher intra-patient variability suggesting the possible link between expression variability and genetic heterogeneity. Important functions showing increased variability in IgM-MGUS compared to WM were related to apoptosis, B cell receptor signaling pathway, chemokine-signaling pathway, ERBB signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and WNT signaling pathway. Larger datasets and clinical evolution of IgM-MGUS individuals would provide a deeper insight into the functional context of the pathways and the differential variable genes highlighted by the comparison between IgM-MGUS and WM.

e7979029d229c18f2882333f0d85eb5df36fc15a,Impact of SORL1 genetic variations on MRI markers in non-demented elders,"The sorting protein-related receptor 1 (SORL1 or LR11) gene has been verified to play an important role in the pathologic process of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) formation and trafficking in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by plenty of cytological and molecular biological studies. But there were few studies investigated the association of SORL1 gene and neurodegeneration features from a rather macroscopic perspective. In the present study, we explored the effect of SORL1 genotypes on AD-related brain atrophy. We recruited 812 individuals with both baseline and two-year follow-up information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and applied multiple linear regression models to examine the association between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging phenotypes. Finally, four SNPs (rs11219350, rs2298813, rs3781836, rs3824968) showed trend of association with the volume of hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus but failed to survive the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Only rs1784933 and rs753780 showed significant association with right parahippocampal gyrus. According to our findings, SORL1 variations influence the atrophy of specific AD-related brain structures, which suggested the potential role of SORL1 in the neurodegeneration of cognitive related regions.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ruihua Yin"", ids = ""6188213""); list(name = ""Jun Li"", ids = ""47786793""); list(name = ""Lin Tan"", ids = ""8929943""); list(name = ""Hui-Fu Wang"", ids = ""113727801""); list(name = ""Meng-Shan Tan"", ids = ""46698953""); list(name = ""Wan-Jiang Yu"", ids = ""4569781""); list(name = ""Chen-Chen Tan"", ids = ""2674791""); list(name = ""Jin-Tai Yu"", ids = ""145668022""); list(name = ""Lan Tan"", ids = ""46816721"")",c7d3b2660f6cd8d4470f82d3ed5a0ae5e4e4e1b1; 67953aa69b25d7592900e6e5d3a78e1f7d93d45f; 9203d6762b3474365e9e98c528b87968e90e6c3f,5537a442bc5379c0ed97cc68e270a17c36da5361; b429061c073121a82c9b54fec2d57b5090018e81; ad4e281293237bdb8efbbd639ac823536815f42b; 1542ee5e81b57f9546849cf58cef0c11d700b500; e22dfe0e786fe16fe9e90ca6cf598353ddd2c9f3; edb8816c775bf726001be93cb9f78c3d822f3fcb; d39820ed0456b4efe7b419e093b261249f3a7d9a; 2861c24bc829f963a594a5916a9ce9616b6486d7; 0faa5f7c5d07843316fdb32853e2ef2aca2434ff; 81cb5802c3823d0aa4867b86fe126d65ee03bd51; 75d4ff8da513f3f70a2a6c52f8cf5ae8804bf02c; a3a1879df6f9fc7f060e496070b156f939e9248d; 16c546a8d31c35eb2604a591d9825aaddf80fd82; 1e793bfd2e2813e68ceefbbfbc9149752d883b01; 0636b79c6049e75bf6c3861df0435a290b5013ed; 18e747530c5cd140b6a4a4d5b8fc3e12d517b0a3; 7f2e74e327e49c94580b410a733bc77df92f69a5; 48cc846be2997cd9bb19c14c932a88c07e716f86; 8ec550ce7e4d45fee4975cb5a1330d536b21fd6e; f1980cd5d9cfbf4cf6a61e9ef467b911ff9bf59c; d8c44b1cd38a27c78af9c9444d8be019e2f26417; 7df8343e00e3d09d3b2944643294ddb4b8af1554; 352f832abad9b76a6d8d560fee5a5dbd66099d45; 782ee5e57c759f377b22047e43545bc97333fffc; fd02d3f643828dccc379199dc657421f99af0a0f; db2b611b794d7afee76d489219bd2ac80fe28cf3; aec2884fa4debee8e76920435eb1e4df8b1e897e; 1179903c4f22d6eaf6faf60f31ebbf0aacf79a94; e6db385fb15e581e0704f99ec4c723b20c332627; 1fae118ed7efe812093446674b78345d8eeb8341; 0a3a207fde1aecf73134e3382c94d1f268edd93a; f16c6477606990276edf4d78dfedcdde2b081c0e; 9a6007f9da3d2ef607d706d1c8c3498109558e21; cc0ae8c5b5c79f91aeff3bae688f86b2be4ad029; a4838e908fd602b599c7b4c04ebb17eaf1a9e11f; 5c23ab764bdcd5ba2595fe0f527bddab5c37d6a6; 6c2ea4250263f2a929c7ed5391e3bcbedbd2084b; f22aeba089e134c6a30f56b3265a4eba2a853a96; 85f94a11b06fc9a514295e21e80c2124c1634ccb; b42c81156e073ec065be4e00dca4d2aac93c1662; 54fca6a1197025469c0113181d18cf5fea990f71; b26002e2492d999556825ab7e1b3f5a5a1bef0cd; 3026551067e956d2a37048d51b2fe1151d4f3ca5; 05a9e6fddd032d45d44f19e5d0da30275db75b59; b7c015fcb3cc3c717a8bbea7de0d9d12575ffbe1; 6e39555d3f30f535217c51d44621d53afd542f30; b94248696d36af7f6c307136ec92501628787479; 517a3d33712223b14f962cd5ab699373b7aefa35; 2fa4054eb5c08545c4edbb42a2f3e35854c9013b; 970ba638c6508f1674df5cf3b73a6ea598a5d8e8; a968021e6cad4c6dd39dd74ced89d423f951e7bb; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 5c4922a8f86f8638fbd77469f75193a672cf99f8; b9675e061a73ee2409556d2eec07143d3feef6d4; de3fcd3e4e1fea2b52ede0653b10cfaed173058a; 56584894a62208302556455b793250e870ef2121; 46140b014bc4c02a394c5a0edd361480353a0b53; fa9e7e5541f4f4304383fe3a987b7f3270363d98,Oncotarget,7,31689 - 31698

Very limited information is available on the impact of other medications on fracture risk in men.MethodsWe conducted a nationwide population-based case-control study collecting fracture data from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register and prescriptions from the National Prescriptions Database (1995â€“2000). We included men aged 50+Â years, with hospital-treated fractures in the year 2000 (nâ€‰=â€‰15,716), and age- and sex-matched controls (nâ€‰=â€‰47,149).ResultsWe identified 3.2 million redemptions of prescriptions for 1,073 different drugs. The analysis confirmed associations between fracture risk and use of sedatives, anti-epileptics, anti-psychotics, anxiolytics, SSRI, opioids and other analgesics, loop diuretics, and glucorticoids. New associations were also found. We observed an odds ratio (OR [95% CI] for any fracture) for fracture in users of dopaminergic agents (1.6 [1.3â€“1.9]) and iron compounds (1.2 [1.1â€“1.5]). The largest impact on fracture risk at population level was exerted by loop diuretics and analgesics.ConclusionsAn array of drugs is associated with fracture risk in men.

a9918fc423a486b4b253d61c7dc6978550c88bbd,Abstract 1942: Change in serum microRNA expression during neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer,"Introduction MicroRNAs (miRNA) expression may change with treatment and influence responses in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) making them potentially useful predictive and prognostic biomarkers. We investigated 112 miRNAs in serum during chemoradiation for LARC. Methods Twenty-one patients with LARC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation were prospectively recruited for the study. Serum was collected at three time-points: 1) at diagnosis (baseline), 2) at three weeks into treatment and 3) at completion of chemoradiation (pre-surgery). Serum was also collected from 10 healthy controls. RNA extraction was performed using the Norgenâ„¢ total RNA purification kit. Reverse transcription and pre-amplification were performed as per the Taqmanâ„¢ OpenArray MicroRNA Panels manufacturer9s instructions. miRNA array qPCR was performed on 112 miRNA targets using the QuantStudioâ„¢ 12K platform. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the delta-delta-Ct method, using the endogenous U6 snRNA as the control. Analysis was performed in R, using paired t-statistics, and the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate for multiple hypothesis testing adjustment, with a threshold q Results We identified 12 miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed between patients and matched controls. The strongest differences were observed between patient samples at baseline and completion of chemoradiation, where eight miRNAs decreased in expression: hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-130a, hsa-miR-130b, hsa-miR-223, hsa-miR-27a, hsa-miR-628-5p, hsa-miR-630 and hsa-miR-720, all with fold change > 3-fold. These genes are known to target key rectal cancer genes such as SMAD4, BCL2, MSH2 and TGFBR2. An additional three miRNAs changed significantly between baseline and week 3: hsa-miR-135b*, hsa-miR-375 and hsa-miR-629. All except hsa-miR-135b* became less abundant. Conclusions Ten differentially expressed miRNAs appear downregulated during chemoradiation in LARC. These miRNAs have been implicated in cell proliferation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and radiation resistance. Further work will be undertaken to understand the functional implications of these changes. Citation Format: Stephanie H. Lim, Paul De Souza, Wei Chua, Weng Ng, Benjamin Harris, Mark J.

f1a8806ed0203171cd14c7069b72a0c1fff2b0b1,Identification and relative quantification of phosphopeptides by a combination of multi-protease digestion and isobaric labeling.,"RATIONALE
The identification and the determination of the extent of protein phosphorylation are major prerequisites for the comparative analysis of this important posttranslational modification of proteins in different biological situations. High sequence coverages and the availability of straightforward quantification methods are necessary to achieve these goals.


METHODS
Phosphoproteins and non-phosphorylated analogues separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were digested using four different proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and GluC) and the digests were isobarically labeled using eight-plex iTRAQ. The combined labeled digests were subsequently enriched using titanium dioxide and both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS). The influence of different data analysis algorithms (Percolator or False Discovery Rate) on the outcome of analysis was investigated.


RESULTS
Almost complete sequence coverage could be achieved upon application of a multi-protease approach. The formation of peptides of different lengths and physicochemical properties allowed the identification and the mapping of all phosphorylation sites in the investigated model proteins. The introduction of isobaric labels allowed quantification of different peptides of the same phosphorylation site with more than one peptide, leading to significantly improved statistical confidence.


CONCLUSIONS
A workflow for the straightforward comparative analysis of protein phosphorylation in samples of low complexity, e.g. isolated proteins, was developed. The workflow is transferable to other posttranslational modifications.",2015,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dennis Linke"", ids = ""153739039""); list(name = ""TomÃ¡s Koudelka"", ids = ""1836199""); list(name = ""Alexander P.

Database searching methods employ spectral matching algorithms and statistical models to identify and quantify proteins in a sample. In general, these methods do not utilize any information other than spectral data for protein identification. However, considering the wealth of external data available for many biological systems, analysis methods can incorporate such information to improve the sensitivity of protein identification. In this study, we present a method to utilize Global Proteome Machine Database identification frequencies and RNA-seq transcript abundances to adjust the confidence scores of protein identifications. The method described is particularly useful for samples with low-to-moderate proteome coverage (i.e., <2000-3000 proteins), where we observe up to an 8% improvement in the number of proteins identified at a 1% false discovery rate.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Avinash Kumar Shanmugam"", ids = ""32922710""); list(name = ""Anastasia K.

9ec98c4093223fa111087d3dac87d2e1698c3629,Shared Reading Quality and Brain Activation during Story Listening in Preschoolâ€Age Children,"Objective To explore the relationship between maternal shared reading quality (verbal interactivity and engagement) and brain function during story listening in atâ€risk, preschoolâ€age children, in the context of behavioral evidence and American Academy of Pediatrics, recommendations. Study design In this crossâ€sectional study, 22 healthy, 4â€yearâ€old girls from low socioeconomic status households completed functional magnetic resonance imaging using an established story listening task, followed by videotaped observation of uncoached motherâ€daughter reading of the same, ageâ€appropriate picture book. Shared reading quality was independently scored applying dialogic reading and other evidenceâ€based criteria reflecting interactivity and engagement, and applied as a predictor of neural activation during the functional magnetic resonance imaging task, controlling for income and maternal education. Results Shared reading quality scores were generally low and negatively correlated with maternal distraction by smartphones (P < .05). Scores were positively correlated with activation in leftâ€sided brain areas supporting expressive and complex language, socialâ€emotional integration, and working memory (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Conclusions Maternal shared reading quality is positively correlated with brain activation supporting complex language, executive function, and socialâ€emotional processing in atâ€risk, preschoolâ€age children. These findings represent novel neural biomarkers of how this modifiable aspect of home reading environment may influence foundational emergent literacy skills, reinforce behavioral evidence and American Academy of Pediatrics, recommendations, and underscore the potential of dialogic reading interventions to promote healthy brain development, especially in atâ€risk households.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""John S.

4406be374cce8a3a331df0daafd3d2db3db616ec,MicroRNA-10a Regulation of Proinflammatory Mediators: An Important Component of Untreated Juvenile Dermatomyositis.,"OBJECTIVE
To identify differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) in muscle biopsies (MBx) from 15 untreated children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) compared with 5 controls.


METHODS
Following MBx miRNA profiling, differentially expressed miRNA and their protein targets were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunological assay. The association of miRNA-10a and miRNA-10b with clinical data was evaluated, including Disease Activity Score (DAS), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag), nailfold capillary end row loops, duration of untreated disease, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±-308A allele.


RESULTS
In JDM, 16/362 miRNA were significantly differentially expressed [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. Among these, miRNA-10a was the most downregulated miRNA in both FDR and ranking of fold change: miRNA-10a = -2.27-fold, miRNA-10b = -1.80-fold. Decreased miRNA-10a and miRNA-10b expressions were confirmed using q


RT-PCR
-4.16 and -2.59 fold, respectively. The qRT-PCR documented that decreased miRNA-10a expression was related to increased vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in 13 of these JDM cases (correlation -0.67, p = 0.012), unlike miRNA-10b data (not significant). Concurrent JDM plasma contained increased levels of interleukin (IL) 6 (p = 0.0363), IL-8 (p = 0.0005), TNF-Î± (p = 0.0011), and monocyte chemoattractant proteins 1 (p = 0.0139). Decreased miRNA-10a, but not miRNA-10b, was associated with the TNF-Î±-308A allele (p = 0.015). In the 15 JDM, a trend of association of miRNA-10a (but not miRNA-10b) with vWF:Ag and DAS was observed.


CONCLUSION
MiRNA-10a downregulation is an important element in untreated JDM muscle pathophysiology. We speculate that muscle miRNA expression in adult dermatomyositis differs from muscle miRNA expression in untreated childhood JDM.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dong Xu"", ids = ""145481070""); list(name = ""Chiang-Ching Huang"", ids = ""122854506""); list(name = ""Akadia Kachaochana"", ids = ""12152089""); list(name = ""Gabrielle A.

3e2589785139ea126722e5c379c7976f68d22983,MÃ©todos de validaciÃ³n de identificaciones a gran escala de proteÃ­nas y desarrollo e implementaciÃ³n de estÃ¡ndares en ProteÃ³mica,"High throughput identification of peptides in databases from tandem mass spectrometry data is a key technique in modern proteomics. Common approaches to interpret large scale peptide identification results are based on the statistical analysis of average score distributions, which are constructed from the set of best scores produced by large collections of MS/MS spectra by using searching engines such as SEQUEST. Other approaches calculate individual peptide identification probabilities on the basis of theoretical models or from single-spectrum score distributions constructed by the set of scores produced by each MS/MS spectrum. In this work, we study the mathematical properties of average SEQUEST score distributions by introducing the concept of spectrum quality and expressing these average distributions as compositions of single-spectrum distributions. Our analysis leads to a novel indicator, the probability ratio, a non-parametric and robust indicator that makes spectra classification according to parameters such as charge state unnecessary and allows a peptide identification performance, on the basis of false discovery rates, that is better than that obtained by other empirical statistical approaches. We also developed another method based on the construction of single-spectrum SEQUEST score distributions. These results make the robustness, conceptual simplicity, and ease of automation of the probability ratio algorithm a very attractive alternative to determine peptide identification confidences and error rates in high throughput experiments.
On the other hand, recent developments of HUPO-PSI (Proteomics Standards Initiative) standard data formats and MIAPE guidelines (Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment) are certainly contributing to proteomics data-sharing within the scientific community. In addition, specialized journals have emphasized the use of these standards and guidelines to facilitate the evaluation and publication of new articles. However, there is an evident lack of bioinformatics tools specifically designed to manage these standards containing the required information and its connectivity with the proteomics pipeline. In this work we describe the development of a set tools based on PSI standards and MIAPE guidelines, such as semantic and MIAPE validators of proteomics standard data files, a proteomics experiment repository based on MIAPE guidelines, a Java library for the management and extraction of MIAPE information from standard data files and a tool for a complete proteomics data analysis workflow allowing the aggregation, filtering and inspection of large amount of data, as well as its dissemination by preparing a complete ProteomeXchange submission. Additionally, here we also present the contribution for the definition of the MIAPE guidelines for quantitative Proteomics experiments, receptly accepted as a new global standard for the Proteomics community.

cc9a4da500538b0c879ad11dcc6ce935be9eaae6,Frequentist q-values for multiple-test procedures 2 The qqvalue command 2 . 1 Syntax,"Multiple-test procedures are increasingly important as technology increases scientistsâ€™ ability to make large numbers of multiple measurements, as they do in genome scans. Multiple-test procedures were originally defined to input a vector of input p-values and an uncorrected critical p-value, interpreted as a familywise error rate or a false discovery rate, and to output a corrected critical p-value and a discovery set, defined as the subset of input p-values that are at or below the corrected critical p-value. A range of multiple-test procedures is implemented using the smileplot package in Stata (Newson and the ALSPAC Study Team 2003, Stata Journal 3: 109â€“132; 2010, Stata Journal 10: 691â€“692). The qqvalue command uses an alternative formulation of multiple-test procedures, which is also used by the R function p.adjust. qqvalue inputs a variable of p-values and outputs a variable of q-values that are equal in each observation to the minimum familywise error rate or false discovery rate that would result in the inclusion of the corresponding p-value in the discovery set if the specified multiple-test procedure was applied to the full set of input p-values.

2e0048828698276dd12b2e126b78b2001276ddab,Automatic Detection and Classification of High-Frequency Oscillations in Depth-EEG Signals,"GOAL
Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs [30-600Â Hz]) have proven to be relevant biomarkers in epilepsy. In this paper, four categories of HFOs are considered: Gamma ([30-80Â Hz]), high-gamma ([80-120Â Hz]), ripples ([120-250Â Hz]), and fast-ripples ([250-600Â Hz]). A universal detector of the four types of HFOs is proposed. It has the advantages of 1) classifying HFOs, and thus, being robust to inter and intrasubject variability; 2) rejecting artefacts, thus being specific.


METHODS
Gabor atoms are tuned to cover the physiological bands. Gabor transform is then used to detect HFOs in intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. To extract relevant features, energy ratios, along with event duration, are investigated. Discriminant ratios are optimized so as to maximize among the four types of HFOs and artefacts. A multiclass support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify detected events. Pseudoreal signals are simulated to measure the performance of the method when the ground truth is known.


RESULTS
Experiments are conducted on simulated and on human iEEG signals. The proposed method shows high performance in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate.


CONCLUSION
The methods have the advantages of detecting and discriminating all types of HFOs as well as avoiding false detections caused by artefacts.


SIGNIFICANCE
Experimental results show the feasibility of a robust and universal detector.",2017,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nisrine Jrad"", ids = ""46895350""); list(name = ""Amar Kachenoura"", ids = ""2856398""); list(name = ""Isabelle Merlet"", ids = ""47387261""); list(name = ""Fabrice Bartolomei"", ids = ""2803281""); list(name = ""Anca Nica"", ids = ""46289657""); list(name = ""Arnaud Biraben"", ids = ""2447256""); list(name = ""Fabrice Wendling"", ids = ""7992816"")",c16b76f601d5dbb745e0ee9f5c475d535ad73abd; 41a3f947b613701335b9c89f23be7f72ae786cdb; abb9caade2d8255172967136b4d136cc35669ede; 98bc3232face45f77dcd04643f0a3ef45a10a842; c3933655c0cd1966ccada90602c33a370c21f6b5; 219d4f2e97cb01b832381196221bc67e1a349f5b; feeeb2369fe2e36f30bc250bbfec597f5fc2a273; d78fad19d4139d83dcfbfb24902dcd32d8824d4a; 7703388f2fba69b89f4023647f9a1b93a5ec9bf5; fa6f4006a1910386e6df7312914c15ebe9fc7a24; 08bde06a785562a9dbce56315b13becbd357051e,1ca93592bb692f5aa46aa00c1062c470d7563ed9; 61932351d7870d15761da5101b850ceaac52ef9c; 0f80518127dc9c5714ae4fce72586472b3bbbaf1; 1bd1faee677fcad21889ea3c1eaf4691f22fbe47; 65fdb549c41cddb3161bc496e056b20088b3d06f; 06c1f90f3a00911737b4d11df06b8f7667a271b8; d6942f07dfb85609e503887448a01f85362d5e86; a1af310962e48b2da8e74d63979e9eec92cf5bd1; f508d32959a3d67d0bb7ed61be893111cd91c3ba; 37dc8456173db32fa3c432362ede60208229405f; 43ddd7ab91dcfd0f3df8fa8021b0f8827cb75d9b; f9f7f4a3dfeeaf0bf99237f1eae185d91d11e175; 01415b95567eb66993dca0baf507c1d7bdadfca6; a31b7f3b375e105f5192fd1c1e80fe27d7332926; 95a58c98ac71be82d871a48028c9dda0f0eda644; 09b3c396d9a5b59057c7514ad41afbbfac9c7444; 6cbb00c8acd5a5c56258c6e2f98a6cff8227cd4d; eb6cd1871e2c9a516d73a19e9c20262074874332; b09e0dc4323f323bfa0f86ffe4f98d30e82664df; e0963717ecdf534d0b836bb94006cb6cba6eeb55; aeecb784a5842f61c14a45007e880e391bbdd45a; 79319abb7fa481ea75babfd7183e9ec6949cacb5; e34e07c13b33cdea5766b6cdb119fc691d6e469a; 46b7a37d9e88f0150ff7d64c7ba9e4b738930c5c; cf417221b16360811ea635cf17fb09db6efe7234,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,64 9,"

72b5dad5b0e79119e74b3294ad72ed7c1d9962dd,Significance of metabolite extraction method for evaluating sulfamethazine toxicity in adult zebrafish using metabolomics.,"Recently, environmental metabolomics has been introduced as a next generation environmental toxicity method which helps in evaluating toxicity of bioactive compounds to non-target organisms. In general, efficient metabolite extraction from target cells is one of the keys to success to better understand the effects of toxic substances to organisms. In this regard, the aim of this study is (1) to compare two sample extraction methods in terms of abundance and quality of metabolites and (2) investigate how this could lead to difference in data interpretation using pathway analysis. For this purpose, the antibiotic sulfamethazine and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were selected as model toxic substance and target organism, respectively. The zebrafish was exposed to four different sulfamethazine concentrations (0, 10, 30, and 50mg/L) for 72h. Metabolites were extracted using two different methods (Bligh and Dyer and solid-phase extraction). A total of 13,538 and 12,469 features were detected using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (QTOF LC-MS). Of these metabolites, 4278 (Bligh and Dyer) and 332 (solid phase extraction) were found to be significant after false discovery rate adjustment at a significance threshold of 0.01. Metlin and KEGG pathway analysis showed comprehensive information from fish samples extracted using Bligh and Dyer compared to solid phase extraction. This study shows that proper selection of sample extraction method is critically important for interpreting and analyzing the toxicity data of organisms when metabolomics is applied.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ryan De Sotto"", ids = ""15457355""); list(name = ""Carl Angelo D Medriano"", ids = ""4718977""); list(name = ""Yunchul Cho"", ids = ""34988581""); list(name = ""Kwang-Seol Seok"", ids = ""12068774""); list(name = ""Youngja Hwang Park"", ids = ""46797022""); list(name = ""Sungpyo Kim"", ids = ""35191175"")",a3deb46ab568b86217a83d5ea41ceb6b1eaa10eb; c8bdd45dceb7abc1ec390eba3659481084b734af; a2c754734cea1a0ad35b475e50ea2a6b8a7622f3; 8420cbcbb6b9cbb43ccf36d5fe092bcce327fbf8,,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,127,"

f6734849a9a54fe4fca9cac825f0f37b516aa6b1,"Systemic microRNA measurement, a useful tool for intelligent clinical decision support systems in bladder cancer","Purpose: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UC) is the 4th most common solid malignancy in men and 5th most common overall with an estimated 70,000 new cases of UC and over 14,000 deaths from the disease expected in 2010 in the United States. Although the majority of patients with invasive UC present without radiographic or clinical evidence of disease beyond the bladder, up to 56% of patients die from the result of occult metastasis not detected by current staging modalities. The potential of microRNAs (miRs) as novel tumor markers has been the focus of recent scrutiny because of their tissue specificity, stability, and association with clinicopathological parameters. Prognostic tools based on conventional clinical and pathologic staging can quantify the risk of death from UC, but their accuracy is imperfect due to the heterogeneous biologic behavior of tumors and/or patients with similar clinical and pathologic features. Use of biomarkers specific to the tumor and/or patient can provide prognostic utility over that available from routine clinical features. Data have emerged documenting altered systemic miRs expression across a spectrum of cancers, thus the potential to rapidly screen individuals by analyzing miRs from serum collected by venipuncture is minimally invasive and reproducible and may identify reliable tools for screening or early detection of UC. Our aim was to assess the expression of all known and predicted non-coding RNAs species, contrasting the miRs in the circulation of patients with superficial or invasive UCs or without any cancerous disease, to determine whether we can identify systemic miRs as screening tools for bladder cancer. Patients and Methods: Whole blood samples were prospectively collected from preoperative cancer (n=20) or non-cancerous patients (n=18), with similar age and sex distribution. Total RNA was isolated from plasma, and hybridized with MDACC custom-made non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) arrays, yielding 19200 measurement values per patient. We used the freely available biostatistics suite Bioconductor together with custom algorithms in R for all preprocessing steps and the biomarker optimization. The best biomarker combines two potentially contradictory features: high accuracy and low number of predictors. Several statistical and machine learning methods were tested for developing intelligent clinical decision support systems for diagnosis prediction: random forests of classification trees, nearest shrunken centroids, and logistic regression. For all of them, we applied appropriate techniques to estimate the generalization performance of the obtained classifiers (bootstrapping for the random forests, cross-validation for the other two methods). Results: Screening for differentially expressed miRs by applying t-tests and subsequently computing false discovery rates identified 79 miRs at that are likely to be systematically dysregulated (local FDR Conclusion: These findings suggest that invasive UCs display specific systemic miR profiles, which could aid in discriminating among other pathologies usually encountered at similar age groups of patients. This finding is of notable clinical consequence and predicts unlimited potential for impacting clinical practice patterns by directing appropriate management of this disease and reducing death from UC. The use of reliable markers also has the potential for reducing the cost of health care delivery by improving and streamlining surveillance protocols, and by personalizing the therapy.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sulaimon Ajibode"", ids = ""2447240""); list(name = ""Liu Chang-Gong"", ids = ""1406987122""); list(name = ""Jitao David Zhang"", ids = ""30773719""); list(name = ""Alexander Zien"", ids = ""2281542""); list(name = ""Diao Lixia"", ids = ""3061982""); list(name = ""Wang Jing"", ids = ""153370138""); list(name = ""Traila Nicola"", ids = ""34599392""); list(name = ""David A.

8a2a09ef11ef10e20e2cbe0610390e6cdf6a9a1c,Bias and variance reduction in estimating the proportion of true-null hypotheses.,"When testing a large number of hypotheses, estimating the proportion of true nulls, denoted by Ï€(0), becomes increasingly important. This quantity has many applications in practice. For instance, a reliable estimate of Ï€(0) can eliminate the conservative bias of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure on controlling the false discovery rate. It is known that most methods in the literature for estimating Ï€(0) are conservative. Recently, some attempts have been paid to reduce such estimation bias. Nevertheless, they are either over bias corrected or suffering from an unacceptably large estimation variance. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating Ï€(0) that aims to reduce the bias and variance of the estimation simultaneously. To achieve this, we first utilize the probability density functions of false-null p-values and then propose a novel algorithm to estimate the quantity of Ï€(0).

e83fe6d0d6ddb6996dfc3496ba94c853bd76f8cb,Orthology-Based Multilevel Modeling of Differentially Expressed Mouse and Human Gene Pairs,"There is great interest in finding human genes expressed through pharmaceutical intervention, thus opening a genomic window into benefit and side-effect profiles of a drug. Human insight gained from FDA-required animal experiments has historically been limited, but in the case of gene expression measurements, proposed biological orthologies between mouse and human genes provide a foothold for animal-to-human extrapolation. We have investigated a five-component, multilevel, bivariate normal mixture model that incorporates mouse, as well as human, gene expression data. The goal is two-fold: to increase human differential gene-finding power; and to find a subclass of gene pairs for which there is a direct exploitable relationship between animal and human genes. In simulation studies, the dual-species model boasted impressive gains in differential gene-finding power over a related marginal model using only human data. Bias in parameter estimation was problematic, however, and occasionally led to failures in control of the false discovery rate. Though it was considerably more difficult to find species-extrapolative gene-pairs (than differentially expressed human genes), simulation experiments deemed it to be possible, especially when traditional FDR controls are relaxed and under hypothetical parameter configurations.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Benjamin A Ogorek"", ids = ""15697320""); list(name = ""Leonard A.

d07d2240e29c0ebebf817b070865c1bbabd231fc,Molecular Effects of Doxycycline Treatment on Pterygium as Revealed by Massive Transcriptome Sequencing,"Pterygium is a lesion of the eye surface which involves cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and extracellular matrix remodelling. Surgery is the only approved method to treat this disorder, but high recurrence rates are common. Recently, it has been shown in a mouse model that treatment with doxycycline resulted in reduction of the pterygium lesions. Here we study the mechanism(s) of action by which doxycycline achieves these results, using massive sequencing techniques. Surgically removed pterygia from 10 consecutive patients were set in short term culture and exposed to 0 (control), 50, 200, and 500 Âµg/ml doxycycline for 24 h, their mRNA was purified, reverse transcribed and sequenced through Illumina's massive sequencing protocols. Acquired data were subjected to quantile normalization and analyzed using cytoscape plugin software to explore the pathways involved. False discovery rate (FDR) methods were used to identify 332 genes which modified their expression in a dose-dependent manner upon exposure to doxycycline. The more represented cellular pathways included all mitochondrial genes, the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, integrins and extracellular matrix components, and growth factors. A high correlation was obtained when comparing ultrasequencing data with qRT-PCR and ELISA results. Doxycycline significantly modified the expression of important cellular pathways in pterygium cells, in a way which is consistent with the observed efficacy of this antibiotic to reduce pterygium lesions in a mouse model. Clinical trials are under way to demonstrate whether there is a benefit for human patients.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ignacio M Larrayoz"", ids = ""4660972""); list(name = ""Alberto de Luis"", ids = ""1907255""); list(name = ""Oscar Jaramillo RÃºa"", ids = ""6780539""); list(name = ""Sara Velilla"", ids = ""4355803""); list(name = ""Juan Cabello"", ids = ""144477448""); list(name = ""Alfredo MartÃ­nez"", ids = ""144076453"")",0b845e309c041bd5e868f3813dc689e348b0ccf7; 06b9b378d70d049ab7a9e7d766f8eaf95630e841; 1c9f3b1e402d3943aa5f0860a46193fe210eb534; 4f5b455f56b3818d30ccb13a910186e4960bef9a; 7ec29a25b80a1769834fad7eb7846feeeea653f5; 2c473f6228d45b4b606f99ade0a16b898e40ca62; 8fe8bd4f4d7465f08af5780cd67376445c441875; 81494e1298dcecf5f0fcac5cb8d2da6d52d2441f; e53899a36d6d30c6db6421080ed757f35ff46077; db6f318e4f7496379c4a259f1a590ebff16c718e,9fce0af5e0a48224ba63ec602eac0ec313799a73; 3e4784c31a8496f5ba2836ac283cc983cf42024c; 9ce27dce2ef196c91ccb2c77bb07e5b45060fedd; 874f7099b0ff29f3f7994c0b885841f1972c5ba5; 3f05039e49d7ecca6d5e95ba34973c5aad41e3aa; b2d3dac4128fd44836c58aa8d5b02885d1a83bd7; 58f015b08ce0f31a0f014139c88ccedb2f96c385; 63c6f13c6854df00464cbea2f4a3ec5ec58cddc2; 27cd107fe81ed79353eebed310757519f63e58df; 0c5099c7a3649eedfd3856a990dad5c0c2c35592; 2407f38e33ec7c07c37da7332b689adf4abda29e; 991fbe91322324bdb3af47d36c7648e19cf9a2c7; 7064574a30700c59e79d9f87214c2cba22b4a3c0; 246bbb2dce9c1162c211bbdb97ee91cbc62b646f; 295eb7d6f9b511b28e5fa0227adb39522ec2c370; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; c75f72e6beb4717661b9b5101cb22cd84c19332f; c314d0aa642bcfc4290782de7b883af49de6a381; 90fb9534fe23d29fe76e3e603b9ffc21e4ea096a; 8a89fd132a0129dca43016c3e914dca86270d5c5; 9ad274c5e31185c1fd6f453f626e1199261d2507; fd8d50fd403df2380cbc23ffdaf653f4768e2013; 8c8edee2f499abbc13d9c218567241d1decffba3; 18b576f76b427ee5907398ab51a1b783a5878623; f40172de15e6956a70585f3cc92748ba4cb2d273; 717a2b4138134beacc98d6bf22b6a62c3283d345; a048a5b230f6cf868681ace80a509a4e1e1b4021; 323a90fa8088c4fb95ad710b256f27eac05eea99; 192c239f7bc88593007adc58cab5b4bc5b6ce4b8; a42e3954c7e8edad86b1aa68c6da98b8f638ad95; a3ce0bb3e1750ab1d69a9f29e264768ac3ca5a94; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 4580ba914fe16fae7d733b96e37a282bed953437; 96f8aca94585a7206a2ddc4c59da1e159ddecba5; 15eaf80dc41b36a9f968521d8c6ee459842724bd; 028ddd89dc541d2fafd1b472e7371d3df20b9131; 6bf2a25461855109c8cefceb3cb2ab5d2322dd86; 60bd1a01f5e65363efdb48777eccc942e7174b24; 6f0b775b167bc59c23bf91f65f5d41bdc9873f60; ee86cdeefd83c40563391e9ceb31eb53c037a67e; 6c440c1a3b91c6694d24a4457a839df06d3f46b4; 84ade4b1c3616c7afc482562ad9fb5f3b06ae9f5; 47d5b346cd194a7e552e142bd0c19e00b49a7d39; 160fc131e3b642721a09a7297bffcc58cf58c691; 59bde7b3624469ed5913f6026b9c1a81985fe81d; 2cd8dc8fe9e89af280eef7e5b00cecd73e564da9; e0f1349e410ca73d961ca5a50e0f9aee9d8824f0; 9771d2df7eb353df6db994223a46a911f91bbeb1; 07bffa9ef0baefdb074c0b4b76f2c504026521d1; f6ab2716f0e18ded7b9daab34f41e5efc472f6d0; 45f0015998c5d08c67b52fc55bdee8a5b2d4f285; 48474fc16e5ecb77a373f90ef939d6a266a3812b; 98c79efff53a80f024b07431a2ab97b182d4910c; 6a975c6724a32a9592b51d59a04f34a13b8e4e7f,PLoS ONE,7,

Gene and surface-antigen expression profilings (GEP and SEP) have been both employed for identifying molecules of prognostic relevance in B-CLL.


METHODS
i) GEP - Purified B-CLL cells from 19 UM and 38 mutated (M) cases were investigated for differential GEP by using a two-color Operon Human Genome Oligo Set 2.1 platform with normal B cells as common reference and by applying, after data pre-processing, the LIMMA (Linear Model for MicroArray) package with two combined cutoffs (Bayesian log-odds>1; adjusted p value for false discovery rate <10e-4); ii) SEP - B-CLL cells from 60 UM and 101 M cases were investigated for the expression of 36 surface markers by flow cytometry.


RESULTS
i) GEP - 77 probes (32 duplicates) were overexpressed in M B-CLLs (UM/M log-ratio range -0.79/-3.62; p range 6.72e-5/3.6e-10) and 81 probes (46 duplicates) in UM B-CLLs (UM/M log-ratio range 0.87/4.57; p range 9.49e-5/3.01e-12); the CD49d gene was overexpressed in UM cases with UM/M log-ratio of 3.21 (p=8.3e-10). ii) SEP - Six markers significantly discriminated UM to M B-CLLs (t-test, p<10ed-3) and separated most UM (49/60) from M B-CLLs by hierarchical clustering; among them, CD49d was significantly overexpressed in UM cases (median % positive cells 71.2Â±36 vs. 10.0Â±31; p=2.1e-10). By applying standardized log-rank statistics in 95 pts, all with CD49d expression and survival data, 30% of positive cells was judged optimal cutoff for identifying two groups with different survivals, 41 CD49dhigh pts showing worse prognosis than 54 CD49dlow cases (p=7.4Ã—10e-5). Similarly, 46 UM B-CLLs had shorter survival than 77 M cases (p=1.4Ã—10e-5). By combining IgVH mutations and CD49d expression, 42 concordant M/CD49dlow pts had better prognosis than 25 concordant UM/CD49dhigh cases (p=1.8Ã—10e-5); noteworthy, among 28 discordant cases, 16 with a M/CD49dhigh phenotype had survival similar to bad prognosis cases.


CONCLUSIONS
CD49d is a novel prognosticator for B-CLL. Given its high expression level in bad prognosis subsets, CD49d may be a promising therapeutic target.

An ANOVA with false discovery rate (FDR < 0.15) correction resulted in 1,409 genes with a significant time effect across time comparisons. The DIA uncovered that Fatty acid biosynthesis, Interleukin-4 receptor binding, Galactose metabolism, and mTOR signaling were among the most-impacted pathways. IL-4 receptor binding, ABC transporters, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and Jak-STAT signaling were markedly activated at 110 days compared with 80 and 100 days. Epigenetic and transcription factor regulatory mechanisms appear important in coordinating the final stages of mammary development during pregnancy.

5ba1eb5ace6dbd6fae959525d6269673c2be117c,Discovery and characterization of Alu repeat sequences via precise local read assembly,"Alu insertions have contributed to >11% of the human genome and âˆ¼30-35 Alu subfamilies remain actively mobile, yet the characterization of polymorphic Alu insertions from short-read data remains a challenge. We build on existing computational methods to combine Alu detection and de novo assembly of WGS data as a means to reconstruct the full sequence of insertion events from Illumina paired end reads. Comparison with published calls obtained using PacBio long-reads indicates a false discovery rate below 5%, at the cost of reduced sensitivity due to the colocation of reference and non-reference repeats. We generate a highly accurate call set of 1614 completely assembled Alu variants from 53 samples from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) panel. We utilize the reconstructed alternative insertion haplotypes to genotype 1010 fully assembled insertions, obtaining >99% agreement with genotypes obtained by PCR. In our assembled sequences, we find evidence of premature insertion mechanisms and observe 5' truncation in 16% of AluYa5 and AluYb8 insertions. The sites of truncation coincide with stem-loop structures and SRP9/14 binding sites in the Alu RNA, implicating L1 ORF2p pausing in the generation of 5' truncations. Additionally, we identified variable AluJ and AluS elements that likely arose due to non-retrotransposition mechanisms.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Julia H Wildschutte"", ids = ""38071876""); list(name = ""Alayna A Baron"", ids = ""29485352""); list(name = ""Nicolette M.

914b90232762bd6b552b0a513d217b8196bab97b,Resampling-Based Multiple Hypothesis Testing with Applications to Genomics: New Developments in the R/Bioconductor Package multtest,"The multtest package is a standard Bioconductor package containing a suite of functions useful for executing, summarizing, and displaying the results from a wide variety of multiple testing procedures (MTPs). In addition to many popular MTPs, the central methodological focus of the multtest package is the implementation of powerful joint multiple testing procedures. Joint MTPs are able to account for the dependencies between test statistics by effectively making use of (estimates of) the test statistics joint null distribution. To this end, two additional bootstrap-based estimates of the test statistics joint null distribution have been developed for use in the package. For asymptotically linear estimators involving single-parameter hypotheses (such as tests of means, regression parameters, and correlation parameters using t-statistics), a computationally efficient joint null distribution estimate based on influence curves is now also available.

162e81d6ad6368d6a72d5b80c61bb6fe1316fd48,Proteome Profiling in Lung Injury after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,"Pulmonary complications due to infection and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), a noninfectious lung injury in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, are frequent causes of transplantation-related mortality and morbidity. Our objective was to characterize the global bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein expression of IPS to identify proteins and pathways that differentiate IPS from infectious lung injury after HSCT. We studied 30 BALF samples from patients who developed lung injury within 180Â days of HSCT or cellular therapy transfusion (natural killer cell transfusion). Adult subjects were classified as having IPS or infectious lung injury by the criteria outlined in the 2011 American Thoracic Society statement. BALF was depleted of hemoglobin and 14 high-abundance proteins, treated with trypsin, and labeled with isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) 8-plex reagent for two-dimensional capillary liquid chromatography (LC) and data dependent peptide tandem mass spectrometry (MS) on an Orbitrap Velos system in higher-energy collision-induced dissociation activation mode. Protein identification employed a target-decoy strategy using ProteinPilot within Galaxy P. The relative protein abundance was determined with reference to a global internal standard consisting of pooled BALF from patients with respiratory failure and no history of HSCT. A variance weighted t-test controlling for a false discovery rate of â‰¤5% was used to identify proteins that showed differential expression between IPS and infectious lung injury. The biological relevance of these proteins was determined by using gene ontology enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. We characterized 12 IPS and 18 infectious lung injury BALF samples. In the 5 iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments 845, 735, 532, 615, and 594 proteins were identified for a total of 1125 unique proteins and 368 common proteins across all 5 LC-MS/MS experiments. When comparing IPS to infectious lung injury, 96 proteins were differentially expressed. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that these proteins participate in biological processes involved in the development of lung injury after HSCT. These include acute phase response signaling, complement system, coagulation system, liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR), and farsenoid X receptor (FXR)/RXR modulation. We identified 2 canonical pathways modulated by TNF-Î±, FXR/RXR activation, and IL2 signaling in macrophages. The proteins also mapped to blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and wound healing-processes that participate in organ repair. Cell movement was identified as significantly over-represented by proteins with differential expression between IPS and infection. In conclusion, the BALF protein expression in IPS differed significantly from infectious lung injury in HSCT recipients. These differences provide insights into mechanisms that are activated in lung injury in HSCT recipients and suggest potential therapeutic targets to augment lung repair.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maneesh Bhargava"", ids = ""5990029""); list(name = ""Kevin J Viken"", ids = ""6859707""); list(name = ""Sanjoy Kumar Dey"", ids = ""46669230""); list(name = ""Michael S.

Now we extended this analysis to chronic dysfunction (CLAD) and to pathways potentially modulated by AR- or CLAD-miRNAs. Methods BALs were obtained from 16 patients who underwent bilateral LTx at our Institution. Mean follow-up time was 21 months (range 17-25). MiRNAs expression in BAL samples collected 7 days (T0), 15 days (T1) and 3 months (T2) after LTx was analyzed using TLDA. The association of miRNAs with pneumonia, acute rejection (AR) or CLAD was examined using ANOVA or Cox regression. The false discovery rate was applied for multiple comparison correction. miRNAs targets were search with miRTarget Link and imported in STRING or WebGestalt databases for functional annotation. Potential targets expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on transbrochial biopsies. Results We identified one, 9 and 4 BAL-miRNAs whose upregulation is associated with pneumonia, AR or CLAD respectively (Fig. 1A-C). At T1, six BAL-miRNAs predicted CLAD by Cox model. Pathways prediction revealed that AR- or CLAD-miRNAs regulated cell dedifferentiation or WNT signaling, respectively, through the modulation of Sp1 or Bcl2 and cMYC factors (Fig. 1D,E). By IHC, Sp1 was more expressed in biopsies from patients with AR (Fig. 1F) whereas Bcl2 was predominantly detected in lungs from patients with CLAD (Fig. 1G). Conclusion Our results, although preliminary, uncover novel miRNAs-networks involved in AR and CLAD pathogenesis.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Valentina Vaira"", ids = ""3813793""); list(name = ""Alessandro Palleschi"", ids = ""19994224""); list(name = ""Gabriella Gaudioso"", ids = ""4566396""); list(name = ""Valeria Edefonti"", ids = ""4798969""); list(name = ""Valeria Musso"", ids = ""151247339""); list(name = ""Andrea Terrasi"", ids = ""50645240""); list(name = ""Federico Ambrogi"", ids = ""1767247""); list(name = ""Letizia Corinna Morlacchi"", ids = ""39697351""); list(name = ""Lorenzo Rosso"", ids = ""32261763""); list(name = ""Davide Tosi"", ids = ""152561152""); list(name = ""Sara Franzi"", ids = ""4312826""); list(name = ""S.

Genetic improvement of milk production traits has accompanied an increased susceptibility to mastitis. To determine genome-wide quantitative trait locus-linked markers for mastitis resistance, a total of 200 cows, comprising 100 top clinical mastitis- (CM) resistant and 100 top CM-susceptible cows, were screened by selective DNA pooling and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. The AFLP analysis on resistant and susceptible pools using 89 selective primer combinations revealed 27 significant AFLP markers at a false discovery rate (FDR) of < 5%. The most promising AFLP marker was then selected for further characterization. Individual AFLP genotyping of the marker on all selected animals confirmed a significant difference. Sequence analysis detected a single nucleotide polymorphism (A<-->G) responsible for the AFLP polymorphism, which was named CGIL4. The PCR-RFLP analysis indicated that the frequency of allele A was significantly higher in the resistant group. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the marker was significantly associated with somatic cell score, CM residual values, and production traits. Radiation hybrid mapping assigned the marker to Bos taurus autosome 22. The present study provides promising markers for marker-assisted selection for CM resistance. Our results also demonstrated the capability of AFLP on selective DNA pools as a method for detection of genome regions containing quantitative trait loci.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bhawani S.

04f7bed86c5a7e6def0711b49bb0e8c40ba3c122,Lightning Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks and Electric Field Mill Data,"Electric Field Mills (EFMs) located in the region surrounding Cape Canaveral record the electrification of the atmosphere near them. Research studying how these sensors could improve lightning warnings has had mixed results. This paper used a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and data from 30 EFMs from May-July of 2012-2016. The mean was calculated for every 60 second period and 30 minutes of this summarized data was used to create a lightning prediction with a warning period of 15 minutes. This method achieved a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 77.6%, a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 8.3%, a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 48.1%, and an Operational Utility Index (OUI) of 53.9% (Kehrer et al., 2006). This suggests that the EFM sensor array, when used as a means to measure the electrification of the entire region, is capable of effectively predicting lightning for a 5-mile radius near Cape Canaveral. Moreover, achieving a 53.9% on the OUI rivals the best methods currently used implying that incorporating EFMs into lightning forecasting may reduced the FPR and save millions of dollars in delay and cancellation costs.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Daniel E.

Calving interval is a trait used to measure reproductive efficiency. Herein we used a novel lactating Holstein cow model of fertility that displayed genetic and phenotypic divergence in calving interval, a trait used to define reproductive performance using a national breeding index in Ireland. Cows had similar genetic merit for milk production traits, but either very good genetic merit for fertility (Fert+; n=7) or very poor genetic merit for fertility (Fert-; n=6). We tested the hypothesis that Fert+ cows would have a corresponding detectable difference in endometrial gene expression compared with the Fert- cows. To do this, we sequenced the transcriptome of endometrial biopsies collected on Day 7 of the oestrous cycle (non-pregnant). This is an important stage for uterine remodelling and initiation of histotroph secretion. Significant differential expression (false discovery rate-adjusted P<0.1) of 403 genes between Fert+ and Fert- cows was found. A novel network-based functional analysis highlighted 123 genes from three physiologically relevant networks of the endometrium: (1) actin and cytoskeletal components; (2) immune function; and (3) ion transportation. In particular, our results indicate an overall downregulation of inflammation-related genes and an upregulation of multiple ion transporters and gated-voltage channels and cytoskeletal genes in Fert+ cows. These three topics, which are discussed in terms of the uterus and in the context of fertility, provide molecular evidence for an association between gene expression in the uterine environment and genetic merit for fertility in dairy cows.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bruce Thomas Moran"", ids = ""47499109""); list(name = ""Stephen T.

eb29eda83903017aae2234b586281cdb0a17070d,Sample comparisons using microarrays: - Application of False Discovery Rate and quadratic logistic regression,"In microarray analysis, people are interested in those features that have different characters in diseased samples compared to normal samples. The usual p-value method of selecting significant genes either gives too many false positives or cannot detect all the significant features. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) method controls false positives and at the same time selects significant features. We introduced Benjaminiâ€™s method and Storeyâ€™s method to control FDR, applied the two methods to human Meningioma data. We found that Benjaminiâ€™s method is more conservative and that, after the number of the tests exceeds a threshold, increase in number of tests will lead to decrease in number of significant genes. In the second chapter, we investigate ways to search interesting gene expressions that cannot be detected by linear models as t-test or ANOVA. We propose a novel approach to use quadratic logistic regression to detect genes in Meningioma data that have non-linear relationship within phenotypes. By using quadratic logistic regression, we can find genes whose expression correlates to their phenotypes both linearly and quadratically. Whether these genes have clinical significant is a very interesting question, since these genes most likely be neglected by traditional linear approach.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ruijuan Guo"", ids = ""50652666"")",,731df2bb791c3fa221ca9498bfe43bb04b698357; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,,,

Estimation of I 0 can be further reformulated in terms of testing the hypotheses Î² 1 = 0 , â€¦ , Î² p = 0 . We study here testing via the false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni methods. We show that the set I ^ âŠ† { 1 , â€¦ , p } consisting of the indices of rejected hypotheses Î² i = 0 is a consistent estimator of I 0 , under appropriate conditions on the design matrix X and the control values used in either procedure.

d230c217d388d76505766d2c06ce1780cb45aadb,Novel Common Variants Associated with Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Detected Using a cFDR Method,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed extensively in diverse populations to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex diseases or traits. However, to date, the SNPs identified fail to explain a large proportion of the variance of the traits/diseases. GWASs on type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are generally focused on individual traits independently, and genetic intercommunity (common genetic contributions or the product of over correlated phenotypic world) between them are largely unknown, despite extensive data showing that these two phenotypes share both genetic and environmental risk factors. Here, we applied a recently developed genetic pleiotropic conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach to discover novel loci associated with BMI and T2D by incorporating the summary statistics from existing GWASs of these two traits. Conditional Q-Q and fold enrichment plots were used to visually demonstrate the strength of pleiotropic enrichment. Adopting a cFDR nominal significance level of 0.05, 287 loci were identified for BMI and 75 loci for T2D, 23 of which for both traits. By incorporating related traits into a conditional analysis framework, we observed significant pleiotropic enrichment between obesity and T2D. These findings may provide novel insights into the etiology of obesity and T2D, individually and jointly.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qiang Zhang"", ids = ""143721012""); list(name = ""Ke-hao Wu"", ids = ""3878335""); list(name = ""Jing-Yang He"", ids = ""50774762""); list(name = ""Yong Zeng"", ids = ""144520101""); list(name = ""Jonathan Greenbaum"", ids = ""39598482""); list(name = ""Xin Xia"", ids = ""144558661""); list(name = ""Hui-Min Liu"", ids = ""2024955""); list(name = ""Wan-Qiang Lv"", ids = ""23620348""); list(name = ""Xiao Lin"", ids = ""38827416""); list(name = ""Weidong Zhang"", ids = ""50550105""); list(name = ""Yuan-lin Xi"", ids = ""153018491""); list(name = ""Xue-Zhong Shi"", ids = ""19865214""); list(name = ""Chang-qing Sun"", ids = ""49321932""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424"")",20d20576896846898f267fbd69d5896f6c83046b; 7394f9304f742e572b4c7b22b75e4ccb7a8e8bd3; 0455336af344fc7a45c089d83bc41c5a1ba5075c,6587c656c7337bd502afd3d738d34f4baa01379a; 3a14152f47cbfd38db21a3d7e6b1b8cf0a887358; 1d776b5b4f00a308cdc5d45629ae79ac75977462; 977dda0f88203277c1c5d29d823b6dcf9c0d7910; 469a953e79b1873a91c2ee339b5d43cc3a9b5054; 1018674a361826d31f3e69f2941160e5ac4ff517; 0cb7796010d4c67556a9dbb29e2a8faf3a283252; c045ba7b819733d6dde7107f1d31fb456dea4f61; 16522ac5199e09714a444e179e3882ab55d2dcc2; 8e95231c5cfdd1699b98445d0f56e887eed8b5bb; 57a45a7340bf171996a4095c8e0c7162809357d9; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; 0c0e363c5d174c70134d52d2b1a94b62c7b0b7d8; 291cde69c16c568cd1705464af0bd1b81a0ae9b2; 753447af50cc40fa31a9c5cd06258d7651d782a7; e6172458a40f35b55ec81ce45e5d8256ad805ea8; 91c71c82356b101042502e2f80efe6a454d7ff09; 32e0267ce83bb139592e93f84f9e414f8980e6ff; 623339b03161fc536f00498eb5d23e24945d7758; 084fbed8fd376f39c22a32988634c3e604c752cc; e4730eca71e0f08ff0fa5f2e1a416c4e2d474430; dfb897857a2c2dac8f656ea44362287274ed33a1; 4543ab931b62f0c49f3477d596bf7223a0ad31d9; 721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef; ba1f227d7f2cb6c6d722ab31cc2e80ab569ef586; ae41aab29a4992f180dee34eaa531895613372e5; 927156050101c0d53bc0b6f2e52f153638d56a0b; 6b934f75231f3edfca32b1a4e1ec3b48979fa151; 6ec61aef2e4be8814bbfab883b7d3c4790fae9d2; 7f77138b4d0d097c5c2e483d578b92c6cc7aa239; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; 4a9f2fa8537633de5f4e8136389f91fc52a22c2b; f979f8fe0a03ade727315a09c73340ed8494fb4f; 0b38874efc350715ff8a882c746d785e9212c56c; f62856e067040a81e60590985237e19564f7a751; 5b1a2310005df4ae66dd7f32a2e7d6fe462ac163; 8258f2b4577c68ee6a7d903384bfe6442e082b4b; a08425b9eb5241904ac17edc533989c98a07b966; 89253c99f8a5984597bd8d5cad308342b7eb0d04; f14f75a56b1891100d84ed02537e0de92c1dea1c; 19a6d2943e31743ff788ef1663f0839b2d55d614; 974b793aaca54d5766545ce0a92d15c1b167432b; d8d4c5b6ad24c7c3b37d8dca4a66caa5f54be6e3; 9e7fdbfd5b759f5585c0a2a7f9b8c361f29bc326; 5dd2993d93ad16c8a4934a836a132c708318754d; bea0f7fba860a1489895936d8753ebffaa2a67c9; 48b4032a0de32aedd89ade32e2e09f59e116e447; 97d7041ca3378045c475cf1069ec3e74130f18e9; 11a3ac464b7cc5afe48172efe12ce4346dbf452d; 987dc4f1c871c25e8cdd255874f6d5729626a885; 44962d9b1a7ff35199b2a0e3858a8f37a8a1f377; 466b657ccac2de30236ae6617ae6588201f2af52; 4f7f22aa77f7b918fbdef193bff39eb9aaa04730; 82806c177d72802998012fd7c3173c291ec952e8; a125584b8d7d7a5be27e3f0e32a79dcec8afe08d; 65ae34915b43cd7c0030c74a7c2def7b321bed89; 367aacce3d30a9f76cc5c5a54f91cd29df7d236b; 9a514c3945dbedee4749a1263767b93a0af42148,Scientific Reports,7,
de8578bfb43861ce8b679f95952a03b567d8db9c,Analysis of composition of microbiomes: a novel method for studying microbial composition,"Background Understanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data. Objective To develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power. Methods We introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa. Results We compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68% for the t-test and 60% for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities.

e17e8caadef5676f8b272214ec0ecd2314db5b91,False discovery rate based distributed detection in the presence of Byzantines,"Recent literature has shown that control of the false discovery rate (FDR) for distributed detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can provide substantial improvement in detection performance over conventional design methodologies. In this paper, we further investigate system design issues in FDR-based distributed detection. We demonstrate that improved system design may be achieved by employing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance metric instead of the deflection coefficient, as originally proposed by Ray and Varshney in 2011.We also analyze the performance of FDR-based distributed detection in the presence of Byzantines. Byzantines are malicious sensors which send falsified information to the fusion center (FC) to deteriorate system performance. We provide analytical and simulation results on the global detection probability as a function of the fraction of Byzantines in the network. It is observed that the detection performance degrades considerably when the fraction of Byzantines is large. Hence, we propose an adaptive algorithm at the FC which learns the Byzantines' behavior over time and changes the FDR parameter to overcome the loss in detection performance. Detailed simulation results are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed adaptive algorithm to Byzantine attacks in WSNs.",2014,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Aditya Vempaty"", ids = ""2513113""); list(name = ""Priyadip Ray"", ids = ""48874255""); list(name = ""Pramod K.

Samples were obtained from nasal polyps of CRSwNP patients, ethmoid mucosae of CRSsNP patients and inferior turbinate (IT) mucosa of control subjects during surgery, and used to isolate purified primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs). Genomic DNA was extracted from purified primary HNECs of each subject and DNA methylation ratios for a selected region of the TSLP gene were screened the using MassARRAY EpiTYPER.ResultsA total of 17 CpG units were analyzed; of which two CpG units (CpG3 and 22:23:24) had increased methylation ratios in the CRSwNP patients compared to the CRSsNP and control subjects after correction for false discovery rate (FDR) (Qâ€‰<â€‰0.1). The methylation ratios at both CpG3 and CpG22:23:24 units were positively correlated with olfactory score (râ€‰=â€‰0.41, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001; râ€‰=â€‰0.25, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.021) and unilateral nasal resistance at 75Â Pa (râ€‰=â€‰0.24, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04; râ€‰=â€‰0.24, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.036) and 150Â Pa (râ€‰=â€‰0.34, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004; râ€‰=â€‰0.25, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.031). Total nasal resistance at 75Â Pa/150Â Pa or serum total IgE levels were not correlated with the methylation ratios at either CpG unit.ConclusionsIncreased DNA methylation at the TSLP locus is likely to be associated with CRSwNP pathogenesis; however these findings need to be confirmed in larger multicentre group studies.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jingyun Li"", ids = ""46275621""); list(name = ""Jian Jiao"", ids = ""144407384""); list(name = ""Yunbo Gao"", ids = ""46193714""); list(name = ""Yuan Zhang"", ids = ""48379914""); list(name = ""Luo Zhang"", ids = ""121860566"")",,513b934fdba8349f3acb8e51327e599a70826e00; b28a93a814b71635bc170f6f5143c0554ad7065e; 84bb969f84c05af213bc87e490b70813304a13b3; 8d17740a2ec0f247120055ab5fd5599e6f6c4d12; 1282f5940ef7a33e4139709ea1173e0e9ab08598; 3c2b355b73dfb2a77cd2c1d023a7582b6db28af2; b8506d2976d4b6a0320a22c83db66385cfc84510; afbacd89af422d7e018836c0f54bbfedbffed35e; ceabf9bfab71f890b067707db8c4107cb6de5fbb; 55ce0a294899e5e45e0aa44dbf05983111c2ea86; 3ccb547cfc571a9a1ab60a6ba39e4749711bd0e3; b44864fa7191248957a6725e3f103231ac2c7f02; fbf2f43577f1c992f114b52cb3cead41ff0465cd; 6b9ff123fbabc2e63307432606ce1cf50e24d242; 255cdd2ae6dc436039aa2fb90431623e54e0578a; 961e544a2b91431a28f49bd0ef164617626b56fa; 84b8f0490d6ee8c426d69d68fbfceebec709d3f5; 04d2ff2c972a7144e97ba87835ec22289e3d0e6b; e712db1bf91d51caa8552effec6c0308f6565be9; b943ac0f70aa153e28a0ef0a01527d9c3696c64a; 7e1b0f73b4d02ab7d3f3ab892fb8c65f03281268; 52a6eb53afe7b806854e9ee40dbf177049506c8e; cfa05868246a1954a472af85ee22cc13f56b18fe; f8fd78c9b7701befcac77e41640f14f0b26673d1; fb20685a5e8af67eadce6526fbe089b2b6485068; b840b0878112947d6a839d05092971118b9a4d33; 748393a71770b0cee88490c11b8646cc9031dd48; 263581c14708de4613a0d910cd75b60171f39203; ee6781fcf017f842981922c303320a0876d0b99b; d95a76f3c1144661297fb6cfb067320d57129e2e; 6b424df87405ccbe54f0ddab6e97558f3d2a59e1; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; c21a51050e08cd08d2aa3eae58cc0717b60af4a4; e78c95e163f981e7927b0da9d8236965185fa250,"Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology : Official Journal of the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology",15,
b917f0f1cfeafcddbf9ed9490fb98fe8a27b8f4f,Molecular and cellular mechanisms of neutral lipid accumulation in diatom following nitrogen deprivation,"BackgroundNitrogen limitation can induce neutral lipid accumulation in microalgae, as well as inhibiting their growth. Therefore, to obtain cultures with both high biomass and high lipid contents, and explore the lipid accumulation mechanisms, we implemented nitrogen deprivation in a model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum at late exponential phase.ResultsNeutral lipid contents per cell subsequently increased 2.4-fold, both the number and total volume of oil bodies increased markedly, and cell density rose slightly. Transcriptional profile analyzed by RNA-Seq showed that expression levels of 1213 genes (including key carbon fixation, TCA cycle, glycerolipid metabolism and nitrogen assimilation genes) increased, with a false discovery rate cut-off of 0.001, under N deprivation. However, most light harvesting complex genes were down-regulated, extensive degradation of chloroplast membranes was observed under an electron microscope, and photosynthetic efficiency declined. Further identification of lipid classes showed that levels of MGDG and DGDG, the main lipid components of chloroplast membranes, dramatically decreased and triacylglycerol (TAG) levels significantly rose, indicating that intracellular membrane remodeling substantially contributed to the neutral lipid accumulation.ConclusionsOur findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of neutral lipid accumulation and the key genes involved in lipid metabolism in diatoms.

17820289ee1fa8c5f198e09317a4a4e2ff09f38b,Perfusion abnormality of the caudate nucleus in patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis,"PurposePrevious cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism studies suggest that the basal ganglia or thalamus is involved in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC). However, the underlying cerebral abnormalities in idiopathic PKC have not been elucidated. To localise cerebral perfusion abnormalities in PKC, we performed interictal brain perfusion 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer (ECD) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in PKC patients and in normal controls.MethodsSixteen patients with idiopathic PKC and 18 age- and sex-matched normal controls were included. The patients were de novo diagnosed as having PKC, or had not taken medication for at least 3 months; none of them had structural abnormalities on MRI. Patients had a history of PKC attacks of a duration not exceeding 5Â min and starting either on one side or on both sides of the body. These attacks were always induced by a sudden initiation of voluntary movement. PKC attacks were recorded in a hospital after being induced by neurology staff in 13 of the 16 patients. Interictal brain perfusion 99mTc-ECD SPECT was performed in all 16 patients and 18 normal controls. Differences between the cerebral perfusion in the PKC group and the normal control group were tested by statistical parametric mapping. Studentâ€™s t test was used for inter-group comparisons.ResultsCompared with normal controls, patients with idiopathic PKC showed interictal hypoperfusion in the posterior regions of the bilateral caudate nuclei (false discovery rate-corrected P<0.001 with a small volume correction).ConclusionThis study showed that cerebral perfusion abnormality of bilateral caudate nuclei is present in idiopathic PKC.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eun Yeon Joo"", ids = ""1920146""); list(name = ""Seung Bong Hong"", ids = ""3018797""); list(name = ""Woo Suk Tae"", ids = ""5316406""); list(name = ""Jee Hyun Kim"", ids = ""2707528""); list(name = ""Sun Jung Han"", ids = ""3642111""); list(name = ""Dae Won Seo"", ids = ""23484278""); list(name = ""Kyung-Han Lee"", ids = ""145554231""); list(name = ""Myoung-Hee Kim"", ids = ""2039362""); list(name = ""Seunghwan Kim"", ids = ""1920438""); list(name = ""Mann Hyung Lee"", ids = ""46293684""); list(name = ""Byung Tae Kim"", ids = ""4866505"")",39ca895f32a7fa3d777cfb6df28611e017255ab3; 86df02d39a347bb4a5e2e19e91fd2a730f7e869e; 49ec72348388e67d0e0202d8711eac4bb8d5f296; c9c7a0b46449a17ff19ad3fec0e6f0a056e85587; 0fb10e482f36b49e6592de693323396808d9f6c7; 91099a5e8ab9f577a8d0272e15ef5eccdc378e4f; 13f8952988ab4d4a3df0a01490daa4cd04414399; 2342fec873d2277ce426a1f4ade253b9b3325bf7; 8dd55d5164a96a76f73551812eb8c83f13b18fcb; acc023ab622388ded528d39e4a56d9efc3f225c5; 637d1327fbaca0dc372206591ab836a6f25db585; 69f34aa5464d120c4ef90c1fedaef0d6c265f40b; 7697cb689ed1f2f3e89a54d2c76f6512f049d828; 2039cdcbf65456951490c72c7cb029f349229a28; 60ff7bcfb3072a743b60ad9ba1b87ec9bc75e75f; bd13be0646cc9c0f650958d01b64f4f6ecd5f874; f2f16d5adc54a63742a7c474d86951fc30495b14; 8eecea2810e3286889acdc6da69b7e667bccbd70; 5a57840a64f2b46d9684393f898c3ec27054580b; 16693f31cbd75bbf50c847fa08782cb7ba9baa75,ae2cd13bd189cfc6625d119ec090b51ad3f21811; d086e73db99e62ada355f7a1815bee81118374cf; f62c4b22f0f93fa884989acd5a6cb62487aae9f3; 478385d63c4fc99720f406f3df46808a96b6375c; f77662a988173feb11c625ca539abf0e1d9f9e22; b6fd480043c75ff90c16578c669bbc69e3f043c5; feae12acc3bff2a464cfebad973095d005d29199; ab3387f0cf1c11f2f556ac9e6b1490acc36cc5ab; f40a6ee9d44322695889ae21a8a49d8877adf23a; bef8b8d44f106ee41ebe48595a70203ef623f20a; 80b763d51e233aedbd09e85c6e8d9158adc9dde8; ca519294a328bb8c1df6a4c7b9a97c308f801914; c1fa9fb991a820b411f5ef01bf84bb76892489bc; d2bc9542332d015d6a39d0ff655ce150fb061033; d17890083ea35826544b9df6da649a71533652dd; a9611059cf4d4438a77af6367bec91dc0222867a; 3edabe48b20ece16ace7532ddfe6d64a353925de; 6b0d6f86571fb4a1c4e85833496fade10cd529c3; 95951d12961aec24e8af32e19b2a6b13c31e1f07; 868be7895ba4e96ed25ee70e6db1810f68efea6b; 92f8323ac2e63ec1ac52054f3de92e5f28e78d3d; dde35d9de937b7a88c920fc3fda69ec89d5f1f35; 4790ee22277be215d12d6ce67e1628f7f4a3c6a3; ec982ed9eae6fa6b689d9cc96f38b69b45c434ec,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,32,1205-1209
f5556807ea957d9f2f3c64cfb432253ec128a3a3,Interplay of host genetics and gut microbiota underlying the onset and clinical presentation of inflammatory bowel disease,"Objective Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical characteristics. We hypothesise that individual differences in the complex interaction of the host genome and the gut microbiota can explain the onset and the heterogeneous presentation of IBD. Therefore, we performed a caseâ€“control analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of IBD. Design Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected from a population cohort. The gut microbiota composition was assessed by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. All participants were genotyped. We composed genetic risk scores from 11 functional genetic variants proven to be associated with IBD in genes that are directly involved in the bacterial handling in the gut: NOD2, CARD9, ATG16L1, IRGM and FUT2. Results Strikingly, we observed significant alterations of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals with a high genetic risk for IBD: the IBD genetic risk score was significantly associated with a decrease in the genus Roseburia in healthy controls (false discovery rate 0.017). Moreover, disease location was a major determinant of the gut microbiota: the gut microbiota of patients with colonic Crohn's disease (CD) is different from that of patients with ileal CD, with a decrease in alpha diversity associated to ileal disease (p=3.28Ã—10âˆ’13). Conclusions We show for the first time that genetic risk variants associated with IBD influence the gut microbiota in healthy individuals. Roseburia spp are acetate-to-butyrate converters, and a decrease has already been observed in patients with IBD.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Floris Imhann"", ids = ""4905355""); list(name = ""Arnau Vich Vila"", ids = ""6749145""); list(name = ""Marc Jan Bonder"", ids = ""1388648749""); list(name = ""Jingyuan Fu"", ids = ""8505787""); list(name = ""Dirk Gevers"", ids = ""49621316""); list(name = ""M Visschedijk"", ids = ""1394126333""); list(name = ""L S Spekhorst"", ids = ""117406017""); list(name = ""Rudi Alberts"", ids = ""48448539""); list(name = ""Lude Franke"", ids = ""144755530""); list(name = ""Hendrik M. van Dullemen"", ids = ""1397316246""); list(name = ""Rinze W F Ter Steege"", ids = ""1397316037""); list(name = ""Curtis Huttenhower"", ids = ""2194791""); list(name = ""Gerard Dijkstra"", ids = ""40109851""); list(name = ""Ramnik J.

2db0d425cca48a08a7dc4251f9381967b96dcf3f,Dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer disease: Neurodegenerative patterns characterized by DTI,"Objective:To identify the patterns of diffusivity changes in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and to determine whether diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) is complementary to structural MRI in depicting the tissue abnormalities characteristic of DLB and AD. Methods:We studied clinically diagnosed age-, gender-, and education-matched subjects with DLB (n = 30), subjects with AD (n = 30), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects (n = 60) in a case-control study. DTI was performed at 3T with a fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryâ€“based DTI sequence that enabled cortical diffusion measurements. Mean diffusivity (MD) and gray matter (GM) density were measured from segmented cortical regions. Tract-based diffusivity was measured using color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Results:Patients with DLB were characterized by elevated MD in the amygdala and decreased FA in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). ILF diffusivity was associated with the presence of visual hallucinations (p = 0.007), and amygdala diffusivity was associated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (r = 0.50; p = 0.005) in DLB. In contrast, patients with AD were characterized by elevated MD in the medial temporal, temporal, and parietal lobe association cortices and decreased FA in the fornix, cingulum, and ILF. Amygdala diffusivity was complementary to GM density in discriminating DLB from CN; hippocampal and parahippocampal diffusivity was complementary to GM density in discriminating AD from CN. Conclusion:Increased amygdalar diffusivity in the absence of tissue loss in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may be related to microvacuolation, a common pathology associated with Lewy body disease in the amygdala. Diffusivity measurements were complementary to structural MRI, demonstrating that measures of diffusivity on diffusion tensor MRI are valuable tools for characterizing the tissue abnormalities characteristic of Alzheimer disease and DLB.

Here, we incorporate DMS data into automated secondary structure inference using a pseudo-energy framework developed for 2'-OH acylation (SHAPE) mapping. On six non-coding RNAs with crystallographic models, DMS- guided modeling achieves overall false negative and false discovery rates of 9.5% and 11.6%, comparable or better than SHAPE-guided modeling; and non-parametric bootstrapping provides straightforward confidence estimates. Integrating DMS/SHAPE data and including CMCT reactivities give small additional improvements.

2d0838755ca51ba85cf16b5493024d15c8f55e06,Evaluation of how gene-job strain interaction affects blood pressure in the PAMELA study.,"OBJECTIVE
To see whether there is interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to candidate genes for hypertension and job strain and its components (job demand and job control) in an accurately phenotyped Italian cohort (Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni).


METHODS
From the Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate E Loro Associazioni cohort, we sampled 924 employed men and women who had completed a modified version of the Karasek questionnaire and for whom deoxyribonucleic acid information was available. We selected 1,510 common tagging and putative functional SNPs in 92 candidate autosomal genes involved in sympathetic nervous system, oxidative stress, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and sodium balance. The interaction of each candidate SNP with the perceived job stress scores on ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures was evaluated by adding product terms to a multiple regression linear model, adjusted for sex, age, total cholesterol, and body mass index.


RESULTS
Among all the SNPs tested, the interaction of SNP rs11210278 located on the endothelin 2 gene and job control was statistically significant after controlling for multiple testing, using false discovery rate (unadjusted p = .00000661; p adjusted for false discovery rate = .0085), indicating an inverse association with systolic blood pressure for the homozygous wild-type allele (C/C) and a positive association for the variant genotypes (C/T and T/T).


CONCLUSIONS
We show that the hypertensive response to job strain is present only in carriers of the rs11210278 wild-type genotype. The phenomenon is discussed in relationship to the controversial results of field studies on job strain and hypertension.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Cristina Menni"", ids = ""3537022""); list(name = ""Vincenzo Bagnardi"", ids = ""6452733""); list(name = ""Sandosh Padmanabhan"", ids = ""145535160""); list(name = ""Rita Facchetti"", ids = ""4840229""); list(name = ""Roberto Sega"", ids = ""152534963""); list(name = ""Marco Mario Angelo Ferrario"", ids = ""34561189""); list(name = ""Paolo Brambilla"", ids = ""48062683""); list(name = ""Wai Kwong Lee"", ids = ""15006604""); list(name = ""Anna F.

c7d1c17055c7320e8d2a0cca313bddc7dcb3d401,S 2 Appendix : Detailed description of conditional genome-wide scans ( Analysis G ),"QTL analysis for a large panel of molecular traits, such as gene expression or chromatin accessibility, poses a large multiple testing problem: all loci tested for each of many traits. Analysis G employs a per-trait family-wise error rate (FWER) control and across-trait false discovery rate (FDR) control, which restricts its ability to detect multiple QTL per outcome in a non-biased manner. This bias is due to the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV), used for FWER control, being fit from the maximum statistical score per trait. To include additional strong statistical scores is potentially biasing, as would be the case when there are multiple associations above the FWER threshold, increasing the enrichment in small p-values, which is precisely the pattern of association FDR procedures aim to detect. To avoid this problem, a multi-stage conditional regression approach was used [1]. The procedure is described in the following steps:",2019,,,,31c2e49c149c2e02949b7bce8be9c395c2e29103,,,
96b337eac2fb537c887ffc292c22ead72b7623a3,Transcriptome analysis of ankylosed primary molars with infraocclusion,"Primary molar ankylosis with infraocclusion can retard dental arch development and cause dental asymmetry. Despite its widespread prevalence, little is known about its molecular etiology and pathogenesis. To address this, RNA sequencing was used to generate transcriptomes of furcal bone from infraoccluded (nâ€‰=â€‰7) and non-infraoccluded (nâ€‰=â€‰9) primary second molars, all without succeeding biscuspids. Of the 18â€‰529 expressed genes, 432 (2.3%) genes were differentially expressed between the two groups (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed clear separation in gene expression between infraoccluded and non-infraoccluded samples. Pathway analyses indicated that molar ankylosis is associated with the expression of genes consistent with the cellular inflammatory response and epithelial cell turnover. Independent validation using six expressed genes by immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the corresponding proteins are strongly expressed in the developing molar tooth germ, in particular the dental follicle and inner enamel epithelium. The descendants of these structures include the periodontal ligament, cementum, bone and epithelial rests of Malassez; tissues that are central to the ankylotic process. We therefore propose that ankylosis involves an increased inflammatory response associated with disruptions to the developmental remnants of the dental follicle and epithelial rests of Malassez.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Annie Tong"", ids = ""12598548""); list(name = ""Yuh-Lit Chow"", ids = ""1500482825""); list(name = ""Katie Xu"", ids = ""12962641""); list(name = ""Rita Hardiman"", ids = ""1500484994""); list(name = ""Paul Schneider"", ids = ""1500484779""); list(name = ""Seong-Seng Tan"", ids = ""1500480923"")",,6daba8fadafa4374ce18f7f2dd2a36b7286fb871; 6c218d3d3dd7caef58580cc6995ff4a2f54dfab7; bb55d02c83c03f02494ef01b61e780a19ef7eb17; d2fabce7e313869f39d4c6fff8bab6e463c21e9f; 62b15a5778cc3577c8073b7889996e15eb63ba13; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 690fbd599ade7e0e7c410a6031cc4da508c2ba02; f4a5e7430a28a7e9f8be394c50199c57b9ce761e; 24d02f3e13aadf9f5708d5ba835b5ec3b156d526; a0f679c32d9a344e92b71f1264eab1c557e1c1e8; bdb47092f963e6553eaf78eccbed7c53f01220b7; be556fcba855aa954c0daa11ff8f393201d2d31b; f80a6ab4b0cfae0d00747f0f41f3e643f22f33ee; 16bc88518091df1e0cb792e8178fdfcb3882deee; 448b85ff88729f61f55dc0e2f5b1042cb4b6866f; b9aaa45f8e037ec919cbf79a40116722fcbde49c; f4b43fe9e8ad8f7815e01a4f2542520c381b912f; 643f95bb80f67d79c41afca2a7a3edf998527d1c; a53828a006c74255daf2c3b5dc93dedf38d71174; 61b1c58278ff8061d9c6da5c4c5228d99cb50e7e; 3a2d940b03e3448b21c0cdb1073c35625905d1c1; 405185ca2bf960fa4f3bdbe859ddffdbfdf2af4c; a6bf8eae2562b6bdf9b4ca5b0eabcfa60b864d13; 35627fdf5687a7d72d9642424a15b3cfae02f221; b0b0bbf17c8d2757f5372797b62f6afc6d7d3496; 5b9c6a2785995d4aa944006b8b5d579aa4a39d96; 48f58cc507cdc5c8ea485a715815c6a490fef86f; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 288a704e819e6ebcbb39b22fc878d118d67ad170; 0a7974483bf5d3fb38efe279d6e40844fe836f86; 6f52ba9c0acaa91db443ea5ce88e8bed7f2c0bca; 4037a040eab6dc24a0649d2365611cf8c8615841; 72f90f8d1e9a90ae95995156bf797f72dfb92cae; 4360c4a46d50525d77bac8e67cc7a02fec2f6347; 6389f8ee62f5c5afb6584f1a9ee689723ad3012e; df7d29456e4fc672235f149ff9f06f4a66e40672; ad8a121dac2359cd52decc81d15e93a94e787538; b58c3e0db1379b698be1300b71805f2d4d1807db; ad331aa1277e667bdf532106777ab564764f42d5; ecc137b939957d0242b40535341086843c0957c3; 002a36359ab0680fac3dd492a113475b5e782ae0; cae525657a4e8e9b67b80495a4f803697de26b01; 77a54ec7b0f7ef2fe6474ee50133c4af270ef61d; 4bbf2621ed90e447214e65ccf7c6caa4c6ae6c59; f8898a588b6f80430d4c50d091f1bbd3afee15af; 73c42031d99e6f2d48d33969b281f84cffce5b47; 8b96d3908a605a3345a4dfaec1dc9dfd88da90e3; 447bf5edc72aa9b8c96f841ff11e8f47e89d2ec4; 97b622ed8ec14d218a597c06e014df73b949a806; bc93ec7d105abd53891d5d543a56cce1807cb146; a11d0f1b6fc4dfc1d382af79c84f1b2cee7503d6; 48a4e4bc15679533e4f8d97674fbcef29c3a4606; 6d741b8936c958b55929106c70f8543ef97e5fc2,International Journal of Oral Science,12,

The current study used single-marker and gene-based analyses to examine the association between RAAS genes and longitudinal blood pressure (BP) phenotypes in a Han Chinese population. Methods A total of 1,768 participants from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity follow-up study were included in the current study. Twenty-seven BP measurements were taken using random-zero sphygmomanometers at baseline and 2 follow-up visits. Mixed-effect models were used to assess the additive associations of 106 SNPs in 10 RAAS genes with longitudinal BP changes and hypertension incidence. Gene-based analyses were conducted using the truncated product method. Attempts were made to replicate significant findings among 775 Asian participants of the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using available data from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. False discovery rate procedures were used to adjust for multiple testing. Results During an average of 7.2 years of follow-up, average systolic and diastolic BP increased, and 32.1% (512) of participants free from hypertension at baseline developed hypertension. NR3C2 SNPs rs7694064 and rs6856803 were significantly associated with longitudinal changes in systolic BP ( P values of 6.9Ñ…10 -5 and 8.2Ñ…10 -4 , respectively). Through gene-based analysis, NR3C2 was found to be significantly associated with longitudinal systolic BP change ( P value of 1.00Ñ…10 -7 ), even after removal of significant markers rs7694064 and rs6856803 from the analysis. The gene-based association between NR3C2 and longitudinal systolic BP change was successfully replicated in Asian MESA participants ( P value of 1.00Ñ…10 -4 ). However, single-marker findings could not be replicated in this relatively small sample. Conclusions These findings indicate that NR3C2 may play an important role in BP progression and development of hypertension.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""William J.

9e0fcb6c91348e8b9fd8e2d53074194cb84d56d9,Multiple Testing for Positive Treatment Eects,Economists are often interested in identifying eective policies together with subpopulations of individuals who respond positively (or intensionally) to these policy interventions. This paper proposes one-sided testing procedures which test for positive average treatment eects simultaneously for many subpopulations. The tests are optimal in the sense of minimizing the false nondiscovery rate while controlling the false discovery rate at a pre-specied level. The new multiple testing procedure uses a nonparametric MLE-based deconvolution method and is shown to have better small sample performance than existing one-sided FDR controlling tests. We apply the procedure to study the eect of compulsory schooling laws on individual education attainment using public-use,2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jiaying Gu"", ids = ""9534148""); list(name = ""Shu Shen"", ids = ""46495012"")",,faba7e21a29fa8f438e8c12bebf6c7bd49b94b3a; 7d485197bcd8eecd18231659ece6c8043a0d138f; af4b3d01c44d7a404f64aa6b8da49cdbc8cb0759; 1cd5c9c208fb0cfe49c950603f02d4381025aeae; e8a38385365e782563fae1d7fa19bf0ea11d2844; 5c63132c921a4e2f7cb4bf06f983ead752f1269c; 7673542fa740593b80fed6fa78743aabff0710aa; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 48dfa03f2bc315534c3d08b7bf9c4cc93fc39450; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; c824343ac540d3bafd7c4eaadb10fb7a1d8e5c76; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 6ea412eb5f4b53ee6796e50026d695b1eddd938b; 9679011ad1d0341c77c76d1f74e749d3b10debd7; 38151e435caacee2019a030ab08d01c0c82214e9; 4440efc12b63fd87c8e9336ea39ee35b33d8c1c7; a759777f7c4d59bd43f870d98f618ac09ad66fa3; d84d35b936327f5404ab89f93bbc75708353eb77; af2a8675a1c160c17d66a0fb2a22a210d6d7eabe; 5ecd4f9293494ca2c8f153f02f167d027075eee4; 2c64d50c9a9eb1deefb90e3f719f0a2da403e56d; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; ca9901847df942c840c5374034b7ddc0178fc697; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fbc9af945f0059aeb941c82d282551bca3c3711d; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; f5da6507c5a424e52fd6ab79d2dd72a44a947bde; b506aeea3bc636939aef71d78d19e7b3479b0152; 7234c244a4e560b44ba2e61768b2d4f5de0d40f9,,,

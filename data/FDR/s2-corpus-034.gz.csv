9ffbf92902bd16fc882bbad8dbb0631556bd7b49,Reliability of fMRI during a continuous motor task: assessment of analysis techniques.,"The purpose of this study was to determine which method of functional magnetic resonance image analysis had the highest reliability in cortical and cerebellar areas during a continuous motor task. Fourteen subjects underwent 4 testing trials during 2 testing sessions separated by 3 weeks. Subjects performed a joystick task. Methods of analysis evaluated included: percent signal intensity change, active voxel count, and percent contribution. Two types of activation thresholds were evaluated: P< or = .05 and false discovery rate = .05. Reliability was determined with intraclass correlation coefficients and a repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between trials. A group analysis was assessed with coefficient of variation. Results indicate within session reliability was higher than between session and that signal intensity is more reliable than voxel count analysis. The intraclass correlation coefficients across different regions of interest varied depending on analysis technique. The data did not support a clear difference between thresholds. The group analysis also found less variability with intensity measures than voxel count. A stabilization effect was seen after the first trial of the experiment, suggesting that in pretest/posttest designs, a more stable result may be obtained by performing a test trial prior to actual data collection.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Teresa J Kimberley"", ids = ""8021181""); list(name = ""Dana D Birkholz"", ids = ""5212868""); list(name = ""Renee A Hancock"", ids = ""144706040""); list(name = ""Sarah M VonBank"", ids = ""4450645""); list(name = ""T.

Variable selection is frequently carried out during the analysis of many types of high-dimensional data, including those in metabolomics. This study compared the predictive performance of four variable selection methods using stability-based selection, a new secondary selection method that is implemented in the R package BioMark. Two of these methods were evaluated using the more well-known false discovery rate (FDR) as well.Results
Simulation studies varied factors relevant to biological data studies, with results based on the median values of 200 partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. There was no single top performing method across all factor settings, but the student t test based on stability selection or with FDR adjustment and the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores from partial least squares regression models obtained using a stability-based approach tended to perform well in most settings. Similar results were found with a real spiked-in metabolomics dataset. Group sample size, group effect size, number of significant variables and correlation structure were the most important factors whereas the percentage of significant variables was the least important.
ConclusionsResearchers can improve prediction scores for their study data by choosing VIP scores based on stability variable selection over the other approaches when the number of variables is small to modest and by increasing the number of samples even moderately. When the number of variables is high and there is block correlation amongst the significant variables (i.e., true biomarkers), the FDR-adjusted student t test performed best. The R package BioMark is an easy-to-use open-source program for variable selection that had excellent performance characteristics for the purposes of this study.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Danny Lu"", ids = ""10023428""); list(name = ""Aalim M Weljie"", ids = ""1856255""); list(name = ""Alexander R de Leon"", ids = ""39729507""); list(name = ""Yarrow J.

03171ff2545a751d080f6e78465b6f1cd92395cd,RNA sequencing data: biases and normalization,"Motivations. In recent years, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly become the method of choice for measuring and comparing gene transcription levels. Despite its wide application, it is now clear that this methodology is not free from biases and that a careful normalization procedure is the basis for a correct data interpretation. The most common normalization techniques account for: library size, gene or transcript length and sequence-specific biases such as GC-content effects. The aim of the present work is to investigate biases affecting RNA seq data and their effect on differential expression analysis. In order to reduce biases due to over-simplification of gene transcription models, we consider exon-based counts. Methods. We two used publicly available RNA-seq data sets from two-group comparison studies which are characterized by multiple technical replicates. We summarized read counts at exon level and investigated their dependence on sequence-specific covariates: GC-content and exon length. In addition, we considered the effect of library size correction on between-groups comparison and the impact of the above mentioned biases on the detection of differentially expressed exons. The assessment is performed on raw data, as well as on data normalized with different approaches: RPKM [1], library size scaling, based on Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) [2] and on Poisson goodness-of-fit statistic applied to non differentially expressed genes [3], and within-lane normalization based on loess regression of log-counts on GC-content and exon length [4]. We selected differentially expressed exons using the GLM-based version of edgeR [5] as it can consider an ""offset"" matrix which codifies counts normalization, that can be computed with the desired approach, and library size scaling factors specified by the user. Results. In our study, read counts show a significant dependence on exon length and a moderate dependence on GC-content. Exon length bias also affects differential expression analysis: longer exons tend to have lower P-values and to be selected as differentially expressed more frequently than shorter exons. The tested normalization techniques do not completely remove biases and, in particular, RPKM approach over-corrects for exon length bias. Moreover, the choice of the strategy for library size adjustment has a great impact on the direction of the detected differential expression. The results obtained on these data sets demonstrate that RNA-seq data normalization is still an open issue. Further efforts should be directed towards the clarification of the relationship between read counts and sequence-specific biases, which are, in turn, correlated to each other, and the definition of new models for their correction.

However, several patients will not exhibit molecular response, but their innate mechanism(s) of resistance remain poorly understood. We explored the molecular events involved in innate resistance in CML. Patients and Methods Five patients who were molecular nonresponders and 7 major responders were investigated by using the expression profile of a set of 380 genes. Multiple testing procedure, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, Empirical Bayes Analysis of Microarrays, False Discovery Rate, and support vector machine with linear kernel were used for comparative analysis. Results Three hundred twenty-three of 380 genes (85%) were overexpressed in the nonresponder group compared with the responders. After a very stringent statistical analysis, a list of 26 genes was identified, in which overexpression in nonresponders was highly statistically significant. These genes are involved in signal transduction and transcription factors, apoptosis, cell cycle, and adhesion. Discriminative power of the proposed gene set was estimated by 2 different statistical methods, which yielded a correct prediction of the drug response for each patient used as a test sample. Conclusion Our study identified a set of 26 genes involved in resistance to imatinib, which can be used as clinical predictors or therapeutic targets. We consider some of them of particular interest: IGFBP2, CDC37, MAPK3, ETS1, and PEA15.

Candidate genes associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) represent potential risk factors for the metabolic syndrome (MetS).


METHODS
The association between prevalent MetS and a panel of 62 polymorphisms within 42 candidate genes, previously implicated in the pathophysiology of CVD, were investigated in 20,806 white participants of the Women's Health Study. All were free of known CVD and diabetes at baseline. Logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between genotype and the MetS assuming an additive model. Stratified analyses by hormone therapy use were also performed. Correction for multiple testing was performed using false discovery rate for polymorphisms and false positive rate probability for stratified analysis, respectively.


RESULTS
The prevalence of the MetS was 23%. In a marker-by-marker analysis, the ADRB2 rs180088 (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48) and PAI1 rs1799768 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10) were associated with an increased MetS risk, whereas the C5 rs17611 (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-1.00) and the CTLA4 rs5742909 (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.99) were associated with a decreased risk. In postmenopausal women, an increased MetS risk was found for the ADRB2 rs180088 (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.65), PAI1 rs1799768 (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14), SCNN1A rs5742912 (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47), and IL1A rs1800587 (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.15), whereas the AGTR1 rs5186 (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-0.99) was associated with decreased risk. However, none remained significant after false discovery rate correction. In a stratified analysis, one or more copies of the variant C allele of SCNN1A rs5742912 were associated with an increased MetS risk among the current users (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.01, P interaction .007, false positive rate probability 0.13).

There have been several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of SZ to identify novel genetic susceptibility factors. To further interpret SZ GWASs, pathway-based analysis (PBA), which considers the combined effect of variants and identifies pathways associated with traits, provides a feasible solution to discover the biological function and mechanism of SZ. Furthermore, to investigate the common pathways between SZ and bipolar disorder (BD) will help explore common mechanism between psychiatric phenotypes. We performed a PBA, called improved gene set enrichment analysis (i-GSEA), on 3 independent GWASs of SZ to identify pathways associated with SZ. The results were further compared to the BD-associated pathways identified by i-GSEA for 2 BD GWASs and from literature reports. Our analysis identified a highly statistically significant association between SZ and pathway â€˜substrate specific channel activityâ€™ in all 3 SZ GWASs (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). This association has not been reported elsewhere before. This pathway was also identified by PBA for 2 independent BD GWASs.

961c427c53bcd98718f26baf521782e6df8937ae,Statistical Analysis of Microarray Data,"DNA microarray technology has made it possible to examine the expression
of thousands of genes over multiple developmental stages or diÂ®erent experi-
mental conditions. Microarrays are now the most widely used tool in genomics
to eÂ±ciently measure an organism's gene expression levels. For example, clini-
cal heterogeneity and progression of many diseases, such as cancer, reÂ°ect the
activity of diÂ®erent genes that command biological processes at the cellular lev-
el. The analysis of microarray gene expression data is thus a very important
topic in many areas, including medical, veterinary, and agricultural Â¯elds. Tra-
ditional statistical methodology has to be re-evaluated and modiÂ¯ed to carry
out the main analyses required for microarray data. Such data consist of several
thousands of genes measured over, say, tens or hundreds of tissues.
In our Â¯rst lecture, we consider an important and common question in mi-
croarray experiments, namely the detection of genes that are diÂ®erentially ex-
pressed in tissue samples across a number of speciÂ¯ed classes. These classes
may correspond to tissues (cells) that are at diÂ®erent stages in some process,
in distinct pathological states, or under diÂ®erent experimental conditions. As
this problem concerns the selection of signiÂ¯cant genes from a large pool of
candidate genes, it is usually carried out within the framework of multiple hy-
pothesis testing. A plethora of methods to detect diÂ®erential gene expression
have been proposed. In our presentation, we will concentrate on a rather simple
approach based on mixture models, which allow the estimation of the implied
false discovery rate and other rates such as the sensitivity.
In the second lecture, we consider another important problem with the anal-
ysis of microarray data. It concerns the grouping of the genes over several tissues
in multiple development stages or diÂ®erent experimental conditions such as in
time-course experiments. A general goal common to many of these experiments
is to characterize temporal patterns of gene expression within various biolog-
ical conditions and to group genes by these patterns. These groups have the
potential to provide insight into the biological function of genes.
In the third lecture, attention is centred on the classiÂ¯cation of the tissue
samples on the basis of the genes in both an unsupervised and a supervised
context. In the former context, an aim might be cluster the tissues on the basis of
the genes in order to investigate the existence of classes and subclasses of various forms of cancer. In the latter context, an aim might be to develop a prediction
rule to be used as a guide to therapeutic interventions for treating diseases of
patients on the basis of their gene-expression signature. Unfortunately, most
standard cluster and discriminant techniques cannot be applied directly as the
number of observations (tissues) is small compared relative to the number of
available variables (genes). We present a mixture model-based approach to the
unsupervised problem based on extensions of the EMMIX program. For the
supervised problem, we adopt a support vector machine as our classiÂ¯er and
we demonstrate the care that needs to be taken to avoid misleading biases in
estimating the associated error rates for a classiÂ¯er based on a reduced set of
genes.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""G. Mclachlan"", ids = ""49412942"")",,,,,180

Sex-specific Structural and Functional Circuit Differences in Youth with Psychosis Spectrum Symptoms,"s for the Sixth Biennial SIRS Conference S226 Poster Session II brain structural (P=.14), neurophysiological (P=.54), and neurochemical (P=.22) alterations. The summary effect size for cardiometabolic alterations (g=0.23; CI:0.15â€“0.31) was significantly lower than neurochemical (P=.04), neurophysiological (P<.001) and brain structural alterations (P=.001). The overall summary effect sizes for non-CNS (g=0.58; CI:0.44â€“0.72) and CNS (g=0.50; CI:0.44â€“0.56) alterations were not significantly different (P=.28). Discussion: These data indicate that there are robust alterations in non-CNS systems in psychosis, and that these are broadly similar in magnitude to a range of CNS alterations, indicating that psychosis involves multiple organ systems to a comparable degree from onset. We consider three models that could account for these findings and discuss implications for future research and treatment. F19. TELOMERE SHORTENING IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH FIRST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS: A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP STUDY David Fraguas*,1, Sandra Recio2, Covadonga M. Diaz-Caneja2, Maria A. Blasco3, Ana Carolina MoisÃ©s3, Celso Arango2 1Hospital General Universitario Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n; 2Hospital General Universitario Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense; 3Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) Background: Short telomere length is a biomarker of cell oxidation and aging. Patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) have been reported to have shorter telomeres than healthy controls (HC), suggesting that there is a premature and accelerated cellular aging in FEP. However, there are not data on longitudinal changes of telomere length in people with FEP relative to HC. We present preliminary results on 1-year longitudinal changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) telomere length and the proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres in young people with FEP and HC. Methods: 16 young patients with FEP (43.8% female, mean age 17.9 years) and 21 young HC (61.9% female, mean age 16.6 years) were enrolled in the study. PBMCs telomere length and the proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres (i.e. <3kb) were determined using high-throughput quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (HT Q-FISH) at baseline (16 patients with FEP and 21 HC) and 12-month follow-up (4 patients with FEP and 4 HC). Results: At baseline, we did not find significant differences in telomere length nor in proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres between FEP patients and HC. During the one-year follow-up, we found a significantly greater loss of telomere length (p=0.019; explained variance=69.7%) and a non-significantly trend for greater increase in the proportion of PBMCs with short telomeres (p=0.097; explained variance=45.5%) in patients with FEP than in HC. Discussion: Telomere length changes during the first years of the illness can represent an early marker of accelerated cellular aging in patients with firstepisode psychosis. F20. SEX-SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CIRCUIT DIFFERENCES IN YOUTH WITH PSYCHOSIS SPECTRUM SYMPTOMS Grace Jacobs*,1, Stephanie Ameis1, Joseph Viviano2, Erin Dickie2, Anne Wheeler3, Sonja Stojanovski3, Aristotle Voineskos1 1University of Toronto, CAMH; 2CAMH; 3University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children Background: Functional connectivity differences in the cortico-thalamicstriatal-cortical (CTSC) circuit, as well as altered subcortical region volumes have been observed in schizophrenia. In this study, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used in a large child and youth sample aged 11â€“21 years (n=1134) including children with psychosis spectrum (PS) symptoms (n=312) to further understanding of these biomarkers in youth outside of high risk groups and with a wider range of symptom severity. Methods: Structural subregions of the thalamus and striatum were identified using the segmentation tool MAGeT Brain. Functional subregions were segmented based on functional connectivity with the 7 functional networks identified in Yeo et al, 2011. Average time series from functional subregions were correlated vertex-wide with cortical surfaces and Fisher Z transformed. FSLâ€™s PALM was used to examine differences and interactions between PS groups and sex. Age and in scanner motion (mean framewise displacement) were covaried for and a family wise error rate correction was applied. Structural subregion volume differences and interactions between PS groups and sex were investigated statistically using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with a false discovery rate of 5% correction for multiple testing. Age, intracranial volume, WRAT score and current medication use were covaried for. Results: Sex-specific differences between PS and non-PS youth in structural subregion volumes were seen in both the striatum and thalamus. There was a persistent pattern of increased volumes in girls with PS symptoms, but decreased volumes in boys with PS symptoms compared to non-PS youth in the bilateral posterior putamen of the striatum (F=9.26, pFDR=0.006), higher order thalamic bilateral pulvinar (F=9.85, pFDR=0.004), left medial dorsal nuclei (F=7.42, pFDR=0.01), as well as first order thalamic left ventral posterior nucleus (F=6.47, pFDR=0.02), medial geniculate nucleus (F=10.03, pFDR=0.004) and bilateral lateral geniculate nuclei (F=5.7, pFDR=0.03). However, both PS girls and boys had increased nucleus accumbens volumes (t=2.66, pFDR=0.02). Decreased functional connectivity was found in PS youth between a striatal subregion in the right posterior putamen (corresponding to the dorsal attention network) and occipital areas (pFWE=0.005). This pattern was found to be driven by differences in specifically PS boys and not PS girls (pFWE=0.004). Discussion: Multiple sex-specific structural differences between PS and non-PS youth were found in striatal and thalamic subregions. Hypoconnectivity between the striatal posterior putamen and occipital regions in PS boys overlap with structural increases in this subcortical volume in PS boys. Finding these early indicators is a key strategy to provide insight into neural mechanisms underlying the development of psychosis with the aim to improve and better target treatments. F21.

Given that behavioral symptoms differ, differential neurophysiological processes are likely to be underlying each disorder.

73685c5c1a786bdb0806848c83ad75e53e606e18,MicroRNA Signatures of Colonic Polyps on Screening and Histology.,"Colorectal cancer and adenoma adjacent to cancer exhibit distinct microRNA (miRNA) alterations in an apparent mucosa-to-adenocarcinoma sequence. The pattern of microRNAs in screen-detected polyps in relation to histologic features and cancer risk has not been investigated. miRNA expression analysis was performed on normal mucosa (NM), hyperplastic polyps (HP), tubular adenomas (TA), tubulovillous adenomas or high-grade dysplasia (TVHG), and serrated polyps [sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/P) and traditional serrated adenomas (TSA)] in biopsy specimens from 109 patients undergoing screening/surveillance colonoscopy. Generalized linear models were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs by histologic type and logistic regression to identify miRNA predictors of histopathology. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to control for multiple comparisons. We identified 99 miRNAs differing in at least one of five histopathologic groups (FDR â‰¤0.05). In a comparison of HPNM versus TVHG, the top most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs in HPNM included miR-145, -143, -107, -194, and -26a (upregulated), and miR-663, -1268, -320b, -1275, and -320b (downregulated; FDR P < 0.05). miR-145 and -619 showed high accuracy to discriminate low- from high-risk polyps without serrated histology (TVHG vs. HPNM + TA; CI, 95.6%), whereas miR-124, -143, and -30a showed high accuracy of separating high-risk polyps (TVHG + TSA) from low-risk polyps (HPNM + TA + SSA/P; CI, 96.0%). For TSAs, miR-125b and -199a were uniquely downregulated relative to HPNMs, and miR-335, -222, and -214 discriminated between non-serrated and serrated histology. Our data support the presence of colorectal cancer-associated miRNA alterations in screen-detected adenomas that may be useful for risk stratification for surveillance interval planning.

6dc9431d6a8705bd335fc2d66cb7860171a844d0,Discovery and Quantification of Small RNA Molecules In Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Using Solexa High-Throughput Clonal Sequencing,"Abstract 847 It was recently established by real-time PCR that the expression level of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides molecular signatures characteristic of the major translocation-mediated gene fusion events in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In particular we showed that t(15;17) leukaemias are associated with the up regulation of miRNAs located in the 14q32 imprinted domain. However results were restricted to a fraction of known miRNAs. We report the results of high-throughput clonal sequencing (Illumina) applied to systematically characterise and quantify the small non-coding (snc)RNA transcriptome of 38 libraries of size-fractionated RNA obtained from 36 cytogenetically and clinically distinct cases of AML and 2 normal bone marrow from healthy donors. Sequences were aligned to the genome of reference and to miRNA and sncRNA databases using Novoalign. To account for imperfect DICER processing overhang at both 5â€²- and 3â€²-end was allowed. A location was recorded where >=2 reads mapped in any sample. Reads were excluded that did not map uniquely. In order to determine the association of the pattern of expression of miRNAs and sncRNAs with the karyotypic leukaemic subgroups, samples were first normalised. The mean of total number of reads was calculated for each sample. One profile was used as reference for scaling factor. The values of each of the other samples were divided by the scaling factors. ANOVA was applied to search for miRNAs and sncRNAs associated with AML cytogenetic subtypes. The genomic context of unidentified tags was screened with RNAfold from the Vienna package to identify potential new miRNA. The sequencing approach proved highly reproducible, correlation coefficients as high as 0.99 were calculated for duplicate experiments, and showed unbiased quantitative features when compared with the real-time PCR measurements previously obtained for known miRNAs. The average number of reads per sample was 11,212,898. The distribution of sncRNAs and miRNAs was determined for each sample. A total of 621 miRNAs and 1525 different species of sncRNAs were expressed in the 38 samples. The miRNAs represented up to 70% of total reads. The C/D Box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) were highly represented among the remaining sncRNAs. An unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the sncRNA reads for 38 samples revealed molecular signatures characteristic of the major translocation-mediated gene fusion events in AML. To find sncRNAs with statistically significant differences in expression level among the major cytogenetic groups, an ANOVA test was applied to the 38 AML samples, including the two normal bone marrows. One hundred seventy five sncRNAs passed a 0.5% false discovery rate (FDR) filter. We identified a set of sncRNAs, called CD/Box, differentially expressed in imprinted regions. Certain small RNAs showed expression only in one leukaemia subtype, e.g. the majority of miRNAs located at 14q32, 41 out of 51, were exclusively expressed in the t(15;17) leukaemia samples, thus confirming and extending previous findings from this laboratory. We also noted the high expression of a group of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) located in the same region. We identified 36 potential new miRNAs expressed in AML. We validated by real-time PCR the expression of one of the new miRNAs located on chromosome 11 which showed clear differential read counts between the samples. We also observed a high degree of variation in length in 80% of the miRNAs, particularly evident at the 3â€² end. Some of the length variants were consistent with leukemia sub-typetype. We have demonstrated the potential of using high-throughput sequencing to uncover novel aspects of the disease aetiology by combining the global miRNA expression pattern with the detection of multiple miRNA variants and new hairpin molecules.

We propose expandable factor analysis for scalable inference in factor models when the number of factors is unknown. The method relies on a continuous shrinkage prior for efficient maximum a posteriori estimation of a low-rank and sparse loadings matrix. The structure of the prior leads to an estimation algorithm that accommodates uncertainty in the number of factors. We propose an information criterion to select the hyperparameters of the prior. Expandable factor analysis has better false discovery rates and true positive rates than its competitors across diverse simulation settings.

41da61b846f1681ee57d0a8cee230fd60482c18e,of Metastasis Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition as a Major Determinant A High-Throughput Study in Melanoma Identifies,"Metastatic disease is the primary cause of death in cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) patients. To understand the mechanisms of CMM metastasis and identify potential predictive markers, we analyzed gene-expression profiles of 34 vertical growth phase melanoma cases using cDNA microarrays. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Twenty-one cases developed nodal metastatic disease and 13 did not. Comparison of gene expression profiling of metastatic and nonmetastatic melanoma cases identified 243 genes with a >2-fold differential expression ratio and a false discovery rate of <0.2 (206 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated). This set of genes included molecules involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), signal transduction, nucleic acid binding and transcription, protein synthesis and degradation, metabolism, and a specific group of melanomaand neural-related proteins. Validation of these expression data in an independent series of melanomas using tissue microarrays confirmed that the expression of a set of proteins included in the EMT group (N-cadherin, osteopontin, and SPARC/osteonectin) were significantly associated with metastasis development. Our results suggest that EMT-related genes contribute to the promotion of the metastatic phenotype in primary CMM by supporting specific adhesive, invasive, and migratory properties. These data give a better understanding of the biology of this aggressive tumor and may provide new prognostic and patient stratification markers in addition to potential therapeutic targets.

119d199b00ab9611865c3dd36f4407e994ec5d06,244 Changes in the Transcriptome of the Bovine Pre-implantation Embryo Induced by Colony-stimulating Factor-2,"Colony-stimulating factor-2 (CSF-2) is a cytokine expressed in bovine oviduct and endometrium that has been reported to improve the proportion of embryos that become blastocysts in vitro and survive after transfer to recipients. One effect of CSF-2 that might be related to increased embryonic survival is a preferential increase in the number of cells in the inner cell mass. The objective of the current study was to determine changes in the embryo transcriptome caused by CSF-2 that promote blastocyst formation and establishment and maintenance of pregnancy after transfer. Bovine embryos were produced in vitro and cultured in KSOM-BE2 +10 ng/mL recombinant BoCSF-2 added at Day 5 after insemination. On Day 6 (24 h after treatment), embryos at the morula and early blastocyst stage were harvested and stored in groups of 50 at -80Â°C. A total of 4 pools of GM-colony-stimulating factor treated blastocysts and 4 control blastocysts were subjected to transcriptional profiling using the Bos taurus 2-color Agilent chip (4 Ã— 44 K format). Before labeling, total RNA starting sample was spiked with control genes (artificial clones) of known concentration provided by Agilent. Labeling was done simultaneously with complimentary RNA (cRNA) amplification. Two rounds of linear RNA amplification were employed. Images were extracted using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and normalized within arrays by the Lowess method. Statistical analysis was performed using the JMP Genomics program (SAS Inst., Cary, NC, USA). The normalized data were log2 transformed, and the quantile normalization method was used to normalize data between arrays. Differences in gene expression were determined using PROC ANOVA (fixed false discovery rate = 0.01). Only genes with a 1.5-fold difference and P < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. A total of 216 genes were differentially expressed between CSF-2 and control embryos. Of these, 141 could be annotated (61 genes up-regulated and 80 genes down-regulated by CSF-2). These included 13 genes involved in Wnt pathways, including 5 inhibitors of Wnt signaling (FRP, MAB21L2, PCDH24, PDE7, PPPR23A) that were up-regulated by CSF-2 and 5 genes involved in transmission of Wnt signals (WNT16, ROR2, CSNK2B, CELSR2, DTX3) that were down-regulated by CSF-2. Several other genes associated with differentiation were down-regulated by CSF-2 including CXCL12, FEZF1, PLD2, and RGS12. Expression of 1 gene that inhibits apoptosis (PRKAR2B) was increased by CSF-2, whereas expression of 6 genes involved in apoptosis pathways (DAPK1, MADD, NOD2, PIK3IP1, RIPK3, RNF7) were down-regulated. Results indicate that CSF-2 promotes pluripotency and decreases apoptosis in bovine pre-implantation embryos. This research was supported by USDA-AFRI. B. Loureiro andL.

2c8bc86cc13fa7c7ed206bb9baa2faba0333cb58,Bilateral Enucleation Before and After the Critical Period for the Specification of Interhemispheric Axonal Connectivity Induces Similar Changes on White Matter Fractional Anisotropy,"Introduction In several neurodevelopmental disorders, reduced water diffusion anisotropy (commonly reported as fractional anisotropy, FA) in white matter (WM) is associated with functional deficits in affected individuals. A potential interpretation of this observation is that reduced FA reflects an abnormal pattern of WM connectivity. To characterize the relationship between WM FA and perturbed axonal connectivity, we have compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results between three groups of adult ferrets. Group 1 was bilaterally enucleated, as a form of visual deprivation, prior to the critical period during which retinal input is required for the normal specification of interhemispheric axonal connectivity in visual cortex, group 2 was bilaterally enucleated after the critical period for axonal connectivity specification, and group 3 consisted of normally-sighted ferrets.  Materials and Methods Four ferrets were enucleated on postnatal day (P)7 (BEP7 animals) and three were enucleated on P20 (BEP20 animals). Four normally-sighted control animals were also used in these studies. At maturity (P100 or later), multiple injections of the tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were administered throughout visual cortex of one hemisphere for 3 animals from each group. After a survival period of 2 days, brains were perfusion fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and sectioned along the midline. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in postmortem tissue from hemispheres contralateral to HRP injections, using a high field (12 T) MRI scanner equipped with a small animal imaging gradient system, and specialized radio frequency circuitry built for these experiments, as described previously (1). Diffusion anisotropy in white matter was analyzed using the tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) software package (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Pair-wise t-statistics by all possible permutations were converted to p-values for each voxel in the WM skeleton created following the TBSS procedure. Subsequent to DTI, the patterns of retrogradely labeled somas and anterogradely labeled axon terminals in the contralateral hemisphere of HRP-injected animals were revealed in histological sections cut tangentially to the surface of the unfolded and flattened cortex (Fig. 1).  Results and Discussion Fig. 1a shows an illustration of an intact ferret brain, and Fig.1b shows an unfolded and flattened cortical mantle. Visual areas are shaded or outlined in green. Application of a threshold operation to the images of HRP-stained tissue (1) reveals that the percent of visual cortical area containing interhemispheric connections (dark-stained areas, Fig. 1c,d) is increased in BEP7 animals (59.2%) relative to control (49.7%). The cortical area difference from control animals is plotted in Fig. 2 (blue trace). TBSS analysis of FA parameter maps from BEP7 and control hemispheres demonstrated that FA is significantly (p<0.05) reduced for 1113 of 8125 WM skeleton voxels (Fig. 2, BEP7, red trace). In contrast to BEP7 animals, the HRP staining pattern for BEP20 animals was similar to that of controls, with 50.2% of visual cortex exhibiting callosal connectivity (Fig. 2). The difference in callosal connnectivity between BEP7 and BEP20 animals indicates that the period during which retinal input is required for the development of normal pattern lies between P7 and P20. If the reduction in WM FA observed in BEP7 animals arose from the abnormal axonal connectivity pattern in early enucleated animals, normal FA would be expected in BEP20 animals. However, as shown in Fig. 2, 874 voxels in the WM skeleton exhibit reduced FA in BEP20 animals relative to control, indicating BEP20 WM is more similar to BEP7 WM than to control WM. To assess the statistical significance of the DTI findings, a false discovery rate correction was performed to account for the large number of WM skeleton voxels. Each voxel was assigned to an 8Ã—8Ã—8 voxel cube, and for each cube, the binomial distribution was used to determine the probability that the observed number of voxels exhibit a p-value of less than 0.05. Cubes of less than 0.05 probability for comparisons between each group pair are projected onto surface models of the WM/cerebral cortical boundary in Fig. 3. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, FA differences between BEP7 and control animals are located within WM underlying visual cortical areas. Fig. 3b and 3c demonstrate that BEP20 animals exhibit closer similarity to the BEP7 group than to controls.",2010,,"list(name = ""Jaime F Olavarria"", ids = ""2239106""); list(name = ""Andrew S.

91d850c79ffe1da36e4f61e541a08e836cb87fa4,SNP-SNP interactions in breast cancer susceptibility,"BackgroundBreast cancer predisposition genes identified to date (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2) are responsible for less than 5% of all breast cancer cases. Many studies have shown that the cancer risks associated with individual commonly occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are incremental. However, polygenic models suggest that multiple commonly occurring low to modestly penetrant SNPs of cancer related genes might have a greater effect on a disease when considered in combination.MethodsIn an attempt to identify the breast cancer risk conferred by SNP interactions, we have studied 19 SNPs from genes involved in major cancer related pathways. All SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan 5'nuclease assay. The association between the case-control status and each individual SNP, measured by the odds ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval, was estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. At the second stage, two-way interactions were investigated using multivariate logistic models. The robustness of the interactions, which were observed among SNPs with stronger functional evidence, was assessed using a bootstrap approach, and correction for multiple testing based on the false discovery rate (FDR) principle.ResultsNone of these SNPs contributed to breast cancer risk individually. However, we have demonstrated evidence for gene-gene (SNP-SNP) interaction among these SNPs, which were associated with increased breast cancer risk. Our study suggests cross talk between the SNPs of the DNA repair and immune system (XPD-[Lys751Gln] and IL10-[G(-1082)A]), cell cycle and estrogen metabolism (CCND1-[Pro241Pro] and COMT-[Met108/158Val]), cell cycle and DNA repair (BARD1-[Pro24Ser] and XPD-[Lys751Gln]), and within carcinogen metabolism (GSTP1-[Ile105Val] and COMT-[Met108/158Val]) pathways.ConclusionThe importance of these pathways and their communication in breast cancer predisposition has been emphasized previously, but their biological interactions through SNPs have not been described. The strategy used here has the potential to identify complex biological links among breast cancer genes and processes. This will provide novel biological information, which will ultimately improve breast cancer risk management.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""VenÃ¼s Ãœmmiye Onay"", ids = ""153093831""); list(name = ""Laurent Briollais"", ids = ""2150326""); list(name = ""Julia A Knight"", ids = ""145672033""); list(name = ""Ellen Shi"", ids = ""50487714""); list(name = ""Yuanyuan Wang"", ids = ""39583888""); list(name = ""Sean Wells"", ids = ""40523870""); list(name = ""Hong Li"", ids = ""1872534""); list(name = ""Isaac Rajendram"", ids = ""3498842""); list(name = ""Irene L.

75f5b32d39f7f0a93cce9fa37d736bdf990135eb,"Multivariate functional response regression, with application to fluorescence spectroscopy in a cervical pre-cancer study","Many scientific studies measure different types of high-dimensional signals or images from the same subject, producing multivariate functional data. These functional measurements carry different types of information about the scientific process, and a joint analysis that integrates information across them may provide new insights into the underlying mechanism for the phenomenon under study. Motivated by fluorescence spectroscopy data in a cervical pre-cancer study, a multivariate functional response regression model is proposed, which treats multivariate functional observations as responses and a common set of covariates as predictors. This novel modeling framework simultaneously accounts for correlations between functional variables and potential multi-level structures in data that are induced by experimental design. The model is fitted by performing a two-stage linear transformation-a basis expansion to each functional variable followed by principal component analysis for the concatenated basis coefficients. This transformation effectively reduces the intra-and inter-function correlations and facilitates fast and convenient calculation. A fully Bayesian approach is adopted to sample the model parameters in the transformed space, and posterior inference is performed after inverse-transforming the regression coefficients back to the original data domain. The proposed approach produces functional tests that flag local regions on the functional effects, while controlling the overall experiment-wise error rate or false discovery rate. It also enables functional discriminant analysis through posterior predictive calculation. Analysis of the fluorescence spectroscopy data reveals local regions with differential expressions across the pre-cancer and normal samples.

71d1810541f1de6373eea755fb31e98b870c7051,Influence of CFH gene on symptom severity of schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE
Recent advances have provided compelling evidence for the role of excessive complement activity in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to detect the association of the gene encoding complement factor H (CFH), a regulator in complement activation, with schizophrenia.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A sample of 1783 individuals with or without schizophrenia was recruited for genetic analysis. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood cells using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and the SNaPshot assay. A Database for Schizophrenia Genetic Research (SZDB) was used to detect the association of brain CFH expression with schizophrenia. Next, we performed a genotype-phenotype analysis to identify the relationship between CFH Y402H polymorphism and clinical features of schizophrenia.


RESULTS
There was a significant association of hippocampal CFH expression with schizophrenia (P=0.017), whereas this significance did not survive after adjusting for false discovery rate (P=0.105). Comparing the genotype and allele frequencies of the genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms between case and control groups showed no significant difference. There were significant differences in the scores of negative symptoms and delayed memory between the patients with C allele and those without C allele (P<0.01 and P=0.04 after Bonferroni correction, respectively). Furthermore, we observed a marginally significant association between the Y402H polymorphism and CFH expression in the hippocampus (P=0.051); however, this significance was lost after multiple testing correction (P=0.51, after Bonferroni correction).


CONCLUSION
Our findings provide suggestive evidence for the role of CFH in the development of negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chen Zhang"", ids = ""145383314""); list(name = ""Qinyu Lv"", ids = ""37480196""); list(name = ""Weixing Fan"", ids = ""49656506""); list(name = ""Wei Tang"", ids = ""145659836""); list(name = ""Zhenghui Yi"", ids = ""2315697"")",6f702dd04012d5f992a6a21a9f0c1b3d7e629d6e; 2c1b078439524a9909bb6ec40f2a27c831549362; 571e494b1cdecdd6fe5799da25682593d56ddef2; 2ea2a24f83fa781baac4bbdc86d97405dc3f3c03; a21f078cb4ce6b9f12a5bff5ba9e26fc0dbc0acd; 49692c4cc0f742f00e0b22a5085b5b871fe55cfd,3fc7ac4ede3b595fc3741c6b57ee547bfd202cad; 9ef50b6fcf1e54250ea01068d43bcef70af16f9f; 0499a3982a3fc5f9be92ac14e242cd797ec3a2f7; 293b8c5f33ba68251dbd866c60e7d6a8bd256f5c; e0b58f5674e9f5d4e79e7560c3c22cd33513d304; 50b8e1ac8936c864fbe155bc4ec3dbd61b5beab4; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; 0255f8d70c237ca7d8582a5ffdaa70d5c5402338; 03a79bd071af8fc9c649612f2632fc11c5d4e2ac; a2b9e68ffc292a46093768a320acb3873c3783db; 1d3343eaa8a266d80175a991956991f1bbeb9f73; 4ea2bccd5191ac34a902764ee7c6b865a3e85b95; 2d9c3beeb540d67b5a7e6c26c81fd732688e60c5; b5300591d83654217df7a243f5e00860e8c2792b; ff07c0d77e9235ed349c27693b730d1225f07f47; 98d7605467ac0f26cc12dd482549c889fcecfedb; 0fabc0cc99623e847e062a78e9d237ce619fe2c9; d10adee959967defc1177f4b4ad5e129057635e6; 74e405711d7f2493453523c2ba3b0e4556a0932e; 4221b9052e83038f40be6807c0d21866c97977cd; 6fd331e756fa5d74ae0bb808a30eeed7efcf60aa; b56fbf589a02cc82fb2ff07fe196e3bea7887447; 83643d83b87485f9ec02fae2fa6ddc4f9938cba8; b35ca84c333686b1290bc6d5504f96d99df19668; 76a7fed854afcd6b513ea40f94012a32626dd3ac; 1ef18ad816b466920b92aae46ed4837232b42688; 2cc79c8d6a96ca4e0f439ccb11032be9c58c0a96; 548d097c05aea08426543fbbbadcae578eef127c; 1e212ef9ccf9227abbd0ca282940e58dae353a86; 92fb19540fb272c61b8b40ffef6548c9606da10c; d5572da024d7d4eff3a12654cd89ec1fcafb09cb; 752de2cfec51a9bff9eac834944422ccd4355db0; fa9b1dea9b0e78b0ef618ab87c592079fbd4d4ca; a8980ddb3b83d6a139543463c9c1b18d307a9338; 6b18d18b9b61a3026019e91dbfe35c66b5225c0f; 0fdd2a9247bfff7cb0f9de8881bca4141c288de5; 665c4a8ad452af0c9ea146ca33aeced104b6763f; 2a8d133fdc389d012e8222f012965dcf09219190; 7c9c96531aae7afc6bdfbcb1a6e03b20d779a17d; 25591f5d9fde558ce5cd7f49607ef87e48e6287f; ac2139f072169aa3b42d25522a65ddcc3ade3c2a; f4dc869e9e00ca6a129a947b8a07cdc37f449fca; da3b4cf646980afe9a80ad5db4d63235a564b02f; fbecd86ece8a8cb70d73737c119b97c215f9135e; de9237a8a1f073afd13d22863964bc9e5ca23279; b798e74cf8954daae13e4b31c4fed5f4a78035ec; 11e8f8bea0a3e687b190e9d964de5172eef5235f; 78512d88f5d98db29e3ba9d3251738781e664b82; a38447807d903c3f579d022889ed9e8cf94d0268; 10da29ff11b5fa023f5b9f611a3f4685e47c7483; 0d1fbce0cc9a40c75585eb92bbefb682f35cc206; 7bd13ecacf81fb18d632e99e791e8f3ae70b027f; 378281ee1ed4d06893f78243eff4f8c830af252a; ebf1eafbfad77df4dc9a511125796738758bd25c; 123210349c3e6d10fe3eade21d75d8e4ebb72968,Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,13,697 - 706
c587b9fdc73881c669f4b36f12a84c2bd47aed8b,Genetic Variants in the C-Reactive Protein Gene Are Associated with Microangiopathic Ischemic Stroke,"Background and Purpose: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke. CRP serum levels are influenced by genetic variation in the CRP gene. Studies investigating the relationship between ischemic stroke and polymorphisms in the CRP gene produced equivocal results. Here we investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene in a large German ischemic stroke sample. Methods: In a case-control design, 1,669 patients with ischemic stroke due to large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism or cerebral microangiopathy were genotyped for 4 haplotype tagging SNPs (rs3093075, rs1205, rs1130864 and rs1800947) in the CRP gene which have been shown to influence CRP serum concentrations. Geographically matched controls were drawn from 2 prospective population-based studies, the Dortmund Health Study and the Study of Health in Pomerania. The genetic association between the SNPs and stroke was assessed using SNP and haplotype approaches. Results were adjusted for covariates by logistic regression. Results: All 4 CRP SNPs reside in one linkage disequilibrium block. None of the SNPs or SNP haplotypes were associated with ischemic stroke as a whole. Three SNPs (rs3093075, rs1130864 and rs1800947) showed a significant association with microangiopathic stroke. A common 4-SNP haplotype was protective while 2 rarer haplotypes conferred susceptibility to microangiopathic stroke. All associations remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia and after correction for multiple testing using the â€˜false discovery rateâ€™ method.

87c8e89e907dfd5337661ee90c07b1748fbb24d7,Genetic contribution of SCARB1 variants to lipid traits in African Blacks: a candidate gene association study,"BackgroundHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) exerts many anti-atherogenic properties including its role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) plays a key role in RCT by selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters. We aimed to explore the genetic contribution of SCARB1 to affecting lipid levels in African Blacks from Nigeria.MethodsWe resequenced 13 exons and exon-intron boundaries of SCARB1 in 95 individuals with extreme HDL-C levels using Sanger method. Then, we genotyped 147 selected variants (78 sequence variants, 69 HapMap tagSNPs, and 2 previously reported relevant variants) in the entire sample of 788 African Blacks using either the iPLEX Gold or TaqMan methods. A total of 137 successfully genotyped variants were further evaluated for association with major lipid traits.ResultsThe initial gene-based analysis demonstrated evidence of association with HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I). The follow-up single-site analysis revealed nominal evidence of novel associations of nine common variants with HDL-C and/or ApoA-I (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The strongest association was between rs11057851 and HDL-C (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0043), which remained significant after controlling for multiple testing using false discovery rate. Rare variant association testing revealed a group of 23 rare variants (frequencies â‰¤1Â %) associated with HDL-C (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0478). Haplotype analysis identified four SCARB1 regions associated with HDL-C (global Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first report of a comprehensive association study of SCARB1 variations with lipid traits in an African Black population.

4ae003c0a447922e2136e96cbd8987b90fbc19e8,Optimal Tests Shrinking Both Means and Variances Applicable to Microarray Data Analysis,"As a consequence of the Â“large p small nÂ” characteristic for microarray data, hypothesis tests based on individual genes often result in low average power. There are several proposed tests that attempt to improve power. Among these, the FS test that was developed using the concept of James-Stein shrinkage to estimate the variances showed a striking average power improvement. In this paper, we establish a framework in which we model the key parameters with a distribution to find an optimal Bayes test which we call the MAP test (where MAP stands for Maximum Average Power). Under this framework, the FS test can be derived as an empirical Bayes test approximating the MAP test corresponding to modeling the variances. By modeling both the means and the variances with a distribution, a MAP statistic is derived which is optimal in terms of average power but is computationally intensive. An empirical Bayes test called the FSS test is derived as an approximation to the MAP tests and can be computed instantaneously. The FSS statistic shrinks both the means and the variances and has numerically identical average power to the MAP tests. Much numerical evidence is presented in this paper that shows that the proposed test performs uniformly better in average power than the other tests in the literature, including the classical F test, the FS test, the test of Wright and Simon, the moderated t-test, SAM, Efron's t test, the B-statistic and Storey's optimal discovery procedure. A theory is established which indicates that the proposed test is optimal in power when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR).",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""J T Gene Hwang"", ids = ""144663713""); list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""144127596"")",c9884bdea21562300b90af23d5b2f494231f4a8a; 51a0f348e5009f08b93d429857e5da11fadae2eb; e45632056e4729665d75f93391680374796d06dd; 9533a5732e570bf1d614b74d2b479443af1d167c; f9548975c5dadb3fcb37bc5a6d616453876d8782; 37cae00437f3d00a8aff2417fe6354137fc04999; 46460e48df2be7a5f8b3aefe6e476d9be90e6d6d; 2e61ea4f8c4797931e3a749dc5b2080221cf6a19; 05a2e5eb8025a147087bb57ac5ae00464dab6d90; 8a337c714b4dd82e6d12db33b1ad0cfcac454b65; 8f642bebc89fcbbaba60c3e651839d7eacb3ccc5; baf4de0e3bdbd631bb3abb78337fdfc94990cef7; bb25855a1ec4f14cff32e1ec140f6b169a9dd87b; 024c6e45aa73c4958b3cac19c989a08be1914919; 6db6819bc46a1d8fce85f04cba83ca4fb7ff082c; 854c7259fdf04b2e874ff0a48235dc4edda9480a; 067e84c228e7590306fb4e7f093634857f6fc369; 982f9e4d6883dae0830160bb1b5150a260c56765; ea0378ffb312a69f227f3e1310ead5cf0fdb63da; 8fca88218248ae342b936bb0b9d0c3c69b4cbb14; 4cc1eee6425525f35a85ead41265a92053e974f5,869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; 97cc7ab1b0d200d38f802bfc26c7315fb4a07ce3; cfc36464bd56c7395d27712a0e03bf2bf06342a6; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 2f24dbb826f18a9105d87ce62886b57068c7eab5; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; ade6b20c913ac8de061862a50c257c05d46a5a30; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; bfec29dbcc9f950593b477b9c22a6382db24e495; 178e55a6ef96feeefe5c34b1822f4df9aed2a049; 1bdb480f609c7828f36f52f6b0ec33dbe2c8e65e; 4d65e9ceb2981fc081f42544b5110ccd07d28976; 324a3c4e9bc710bf5fbcc490da75ba3e02a3fee3; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; fce009e245d2af43003c7bf7dd34d4ecd0476a05; 167facf2cbd55a03be51a5937aec7d15fac2fcb9,Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology,9,
f66f3fca9532a2ab53421a9be2eaead265740939,Upper bounds for the number of true null hypotheses and novel estimates for error rates in multiple testing,"When testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, a quantity of interest is the number m0 of true null hypotheses. We present a general framework for finding upper probabilistic bounds for m0, that is estimates b m0 with the property P [b m0 â‰¥ m0] â‰¥ 1âˆ’Î± for any chosen level Î±. A conservative, one-sided (1âˆ’Î±) confidence interval for m0 is then given by [0, b m0]. Moreover, b m0 can be used for novel estimates of type I errors in multiple testing such as the false discovery rate. Control of the family-wise error rate emerges as a special case in our framework but suffers from vanishing power for a large number of tested hypotheses. We present a different estimate such that the ability to detect true non-null hypotheses increases with the number of tested hypotheses. A detailed algorithm is provided. The method is valid under general and unknown dependence between the test statistics. We develop the method primarily for multiple testing of associations between random variables. The method is illustrated with simulation studies and applications to microarray data.",2004,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Nicolai Meinshausen"", ids = ""90491982""); list(name = ""Peter Lukas BÃ¼hlmann"", ids = ""2738912"")",,,,121,
5e6dd909dbe2c786e8bbd1d4f26960175fefbfa7,A transgenic resource for conditional competitive inhibition of conserved Drosophila microRNAs,"Although the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) in development and disease is well established, understanding the function of individual miRNAs remains challenging. Development of competitive inhibitor molecules such as miRNA sponges has allowed the community to address individual miRNA function in vivo. However, the application of these loss-of-function strategies has been limited. Here we offer a comprehensive library of 141 conditional miRNA sponges targeting well-conserved miRNAs in Drosophila. Ubiquitous miRNA sponge delivery and consequent systemic miRNA inhibition uncovers a relatively small number of miRNA families underlying viability and gross morphogenesis, with false discovery rates in the 4-8% range. In contrast, tissue-specific silencing of muscle-enriched miRNAs reveals a surprisingly large number of novel miRNA contributions to the maintenance of adult indirect flight muscle structure and function. A strong correlation between miRNA abundance and physiological relevance is not observed, underscoring the importance of unbiased screens when assessing the contributions of miRNAs to complex biological processes.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tudor A.

bd1eadf09d17b97291d9f81870315ce460e7fde8,In search of candidate genes critically expressed in the human endometrium during the window of implantation.,"BACKGROUND
In this prospective randomized blinded clinical trial, we examined gene expression profiles of the human endometrium during the early and mid-luteal phases of the natural cycle.


METHODS
An endometrial biopsy was performed on day 16 (LH +3) or on day 21 (LH +8), followed by RNA extraction and microarray analysis using an Affymetrix HG-U95A microchip. Data analysis was carried out using pairwise multiple group comparison with the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) software.


RESULTS
With a false discovery rate of 0, the analysis revealed that 107 genes were significantly and differently expressed (> or =2-fold) during the early versus the mid-luteal phase of the cycle. Forty-five of these genes have not been previously linked to endometrial receptivity. Validation of the microarray data was accomplished using semiquantitative RT-PCR. We demonstrated the presence of estrogen and progesterone response elements (ERE and PRE) by analysis of the 5'-flanking regions of a subset of differentially regulated genes.


CONCLUSIONS
Using a strict bioinformatics approach of microarray data, we demonstrated significant changes in candidate genes during the transition of the early to the mid-luteal phase of the human endometrium that may have functional significance for the opening and maintenance of the window of implantation.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""SebastiÃ¡n Mirkin"", ids = ""5466465""); list(name = ""Murat Arslan"", ids = ""46479057""); list(name = ""Dmitri Churikov"", ids = ""143639758""); list(name = ""Alberto Corica"", ids = ""39220744""); list(name = ""J.

c65bca83c5f8b9cdbe27d43b8722a81d80e69120,Gene Expression Changes in Bone Marrow Cells from Diamond-Blackfan Anemia Patients.,"Diamond-Blackfan anemia is usually characterized by anemia, absence or insufficiency of erythroid precursors in bone marrow, growth retardation and diverse congenital anomalies that are present in approximately half of patients, indicating that DBA is a broad disorder of development. Mutations of RPS19 are found in approximately 25% of DBA patients. There is good evidence for a second DBA gene, located on chromosome 8, and further genetic heterogeneity of the disease is likely. The aim of this study is to determine the most disturbed molecular pathways in DBA patients, based on gene expression changes in bone marrow cells. Knowing these pathways will possibly enable us to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms of DBA and find other genes involved in the disease. Bone marrow cells from 6 normal individuals and 3 DBA patients with RPS19 mutations, currently in remission, were FACS separated into 3 populations: primitive (P), erythroid (E) and myeloid (M) containing CD34+CD71-CD45RA-, CD34+CD71hiCD45RA- and CD34+CD71lowCD45RA+ cells, respectively. The purity of each sorted population was >97%. As a control for cell sorting accuracy, methylcellulose assay demonstrated that the P populations were highly enriched in primitive BFU-E and CFU-GEMM colonies, the E populations gave rise to BFU-E and CFU-E colonies in more than 90% of the CFCs, while more than 99% colonies from M populations were CFU-G, CFU-M and CFU-GM. RNA targets from these three FACS sorted cellular subsets was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A chips (>22,000 probe sets). The data from all 27 samples were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis, and each cell population was also studied separately. All pairwise comparisons among 27 datasets showed correlations with r=0.86â€“0.99. Hierarchical clustering identified three major specimen clusters, perfectly overlapping with the three different cell populations under study. Principal Component 1 and 2 separated the three studied subgroups P, E, and M. In each cell population analysis, 3 patient samples were compared to 6 control samples using 1)Significance Analysis of Microarrays with fold change 2 or greater and false discovery rate 1%, 2)Geometric Fold Change analysis and 3)Filter on Fold Change GeneSpring application (arithmetic analysis). All fold change analyses revealed the most significantly changed transcripts in patients vs. control individuals in E (45 upregulated and 184 downregulated) and P populations. The most changed genes in E subgroup were apoptosis related genes, namely TNFRSF10B and TNFRSF6 (CD95/Fas), upregulated in patients 10 and 3 fold, respectively. Other most changed genes were cancer related and genes involved in developmental processes and nucleic acid binding. Additionally, several ribosomal protein genes, namely RPL10L, RPL28, RPL36, RPL13, RPL27a and RPL37a were significantly underexpressed in P and E populations of DBA patients. All three analyses showed that RPL10L, RPL28 and RPL36 are underexpressed in the M population. This finding indicates that ribosomal protein genes are closely co-regulated and that RPS19 protein abnormalities result in downregulation of the additional ribosomal protein genes in both erythroid and nonerythroid cells in DBA patients.",2004,Biology,"list(name = ""Hanna T.

Here we report the optimization of metabolome analysis by nanoflow ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry. Reliable peak features were extracted from the LC-MS runs based on mandatory detection in duplicates and additional noise filtering according to blank injections. The run-to-run variation in peak area showed a median of 14%, and the false discovery rate during a mock comparison was evaluated. To maximize the number of peak features identified, we systematically characterized the effect of sample loading amount, gradient length, and MS resolution. The number of features initially rose and later reached a plateau as a function of sample amount, fitting a hyperbolic curve. Longer gradients improved unique feature detection in part by time-resolving isobaric species. Increasing the MS resolution up to 120000 also aided in the differentiation of near isobaric metabolites, but higher MS resolution reduced the data acquisition rate and conferred no benefits, as predicted from a theoretical simulation of possible metabolites. Moreover, a biphasic LC gradient allowed even distribution of peak features across the elution, yielding markedly more peak features than the linear gradient. Using this robust nUPLC-HRMS platform, we were able to consistently analyze ~6500 metabolite features in a single 60 min gradient from 2 mg of yeast, equivalent to ~50 million cells. We applied this optimized method in a case study of drug (bortezomib) resistant and drug-sensitive multiple myeloma cells. Overall, 18% of metabolite features were matched to KEGG identifiers, enabling pathway enrichment analysis. Principal component analysis and heat map data correctly clustered isogenic phenotypes, highlighting the potential for hundreds of small molecule biomarkers of cancer drug resistance.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Drew R Jones"", ids = ""13100316""); list(name = ""Zhiping Wu"", ids = ""144804825""); list(name = ""Dharminder Chauhan"", ids = ""1903780""); list(name = ""Kenneth C.

c555c60519c42262ff1a0fe41a2acedc1aa3d8cf,Genetic studies on components of the Wnt signalling pathway and the severity of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.,"BACKGROUND
Progression of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is partly heritable; knowledge of genetic factors may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying joint destruction. The activity of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway influences osteoblast differentiation. Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) and sclerostin (Sost) are negative regulators and lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 (LRP-5) and Kremen-1 are transmembrane receptors involved in this pathway.


OBJECTIVE
To study variants in the genes encoding these proteins in relation to progression of joint destruction.


METHODS
1418 patients with RA of four cohorts with 4885 sets of hands and feet x-rays were studied. Explorative analyses were performed on 600 patients with RA from Leiden on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging Dkk-1, Sost, Kremen-1 and LRP-5. SNPs significantly associating with joint damage progression were subsequently genotyped in cohorts from Groningen (NL), Sheffield (UK) and Lund (Sweden). Data were summarised in meta-analyses. Serum levels of functional Dkk-1 and sclerostin were measured and studied in relation to genotypes.


RESULTS
In the first cohort, six Dkk-1, three Sost, one Kremen-1 and 10 LRP-5 SNPs were significantly associated with radiological progression of joint destruction. Three Dkk-1 SNPs were associated significantly with progression of joint damage in the meta-analysis, also after correction for multiple testing (rs1896368, rs1896367 and rs1528873). Two Sost SNPs tended to significance (rs4792909 and rs6503475, p=0.07 after false discovery rate correction). Gene-gene interactions between SNPs on Dkk-1 and Sost were seen. Serum levels of Dkk-1 were significantly correlated with the genotypes in rs1896368 (p=0.02).


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with RA carrying risk alleles of genetic variants in Dkk-1 have higher serum levels of functional Dkk-1 and more progressive joint destruction over time.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Diederik P C de Rooy"", ids = ""5110507""); list(name = ""Nataliya G.

9a6033cb66639a0caf6e302d38442506b8489580,Integrating de novo Sequencing and Database Search for Monoclonal Antibody Sequencing.,"A mass spectrometry-based workflow for sequencing the monoclonal antibodies was presented. It combined multi-enzyme digestion, acquisition of high-resolution on both precursor and fragment steps, and integration of database search and de novo sequencing. All MS/MS spectra were first searched against a database, and the top ranking proteins were selected as protein candidates. Unidentified spectra were performed de novo sequencing. The good de novo sequences were selected for homology matching with candidate proteins. The sequence segments of protein candidates were replaced with the de novo sequences to generate new candidates until no better protein candidates could be found. 
 
A sample of human monoclonal antibody was reduced, alkylated, and digested with six different enzymes (AspN, chymotrypsin, GluC, LysC, pepsin and trypsin). Peptide mixtures were analyzed using nana-LC-MS on LTQ-Ortritrap at high resolution in the Orbitrap. Six raw data (MS/MS spectra) were analyzed with PEAKS. All MS/MS spectra were searched against a public antibody database. The proteins (IGHG1, HV102, IGKC, KV304, etc.) were selected as the candidate for further analysis. At 0.5% of false discovery rate (FDR), the majority of the constant region sequences of heavy chain (Ig gamma) and light chain (Ig kappa) can be found in current database with the coverage of 99% and 100% respectively. However, the variable domains containing complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are not complete in the database, with the coverage of 40% for the heavy chain and 36% for the light chain. By iteratively finding homology matches, full sequences of the antibodies including both constant regions and variable regions were determined with 0.5% of FDR. For example, the sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain was determined by the homology match of KFKSKATLTVDKSASTAYME from de novo sequence to KFYGRVTLTRDTSASTAYME from the database.

1ea36192aadf13efdd5dede5690296e6df3e049a,Movie trailer classification using deer hunting optimization based deep convolutional neural network in video sequences,"In current situation, video classification is one of the important research domains. Since video is a complex media with various components, classification of video is normally a complex process. This paper presented a human action based movie trailer classification using optimized deep convolutional neural network in video sequences. Initially, images are converted into the grayscale conversion. Using the adaptive median filtering process, the pre-processing stage is accomplished. Threshold based segmentation approach is utilized for subtracting the background from the video frames and to extract the foreground portion. In the feature extraction stage, the visual features (color and texture features) and motion features are extracted from the segmented portion. Finally, the mined features are trained and classified with the help of optimized deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for the movie trailer classifications. Here, the deer hunting optimization (DHO) is introduced to optimize the weight values of DCNN. The proposed (DCNN-DHO) human action based movie trailer classification is executed in the MATLAB environment. The experimental results are evaluated and compared with the existing methods in terms of accuracy, false alarm rate, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-measure and false discovery rate. The results of the proposed method are compared with filtering process and without filtering process in which 95.23% of accuracy is achieved for the suggested approach with filtering and 90.91% of accuracy is achieved for the suggested approach without filtering process.",2020,,"list(name = ""Prashant Giridhar Shambharkar"", ids = ""5970591""); list(name = ""M.

Type I error rate control in a microarrays experiment with eucalyptus. 2008. 56 p. Dissertation (Master in Agronomy /Statistics and Agricultural Experimentation ) Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, MG.* Genolyptus project aims to identify features of functional genomics of Eucalyptus sp. Within this project a microarray experiment using 10 Nimblegen platform (monochromatic) slides was performed. In this type of experiment thousands of simultaneous tests for different response variables are carried out in the same experimental units. In this work we investigate the consequences of applying False discovery rates (FDR, Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) to identify probes with greatest potential of differential expression. The treatment structure comprises high and low lignin content. Five treatments were established, namely: T1: Eucaliptus grandis, clone 1, leaf sample; T2: Eucaliptus grandis, clone 1, stem sample; T3: Eucaliptus grandis, clone 2, leaf sample; T4: Eucaliptus globulos, clone 3, leaf sample; T5: Eucaliptus globulos, clone 4, leaf sample. An extra biological sample (a different clone) was established for each treatment combination. 1113 non-transformed response variables did not pass Shappiro-Wilk normality test and were then transformed according to Box-Cox procedure. From the 801 normally distributed response variables, after transformation, 12 showed significance of treatment effects. For the remaining probes that passed normality test, 40 have shown significance of treatment effects, resulting 52 probes to be investigated on specific contrasts and further testing. Using FDR and ""t"" test at 1% significance level, for the contrast E.grandis x E.globulos there where 43 significant probes. There were 33 significant contrasts between leaves and stems; 36 among clones of E.grandis and 13 significant contrasts among clones of E.globulos. FDR procedure and BoxCox transformation had shown satisfactory results in reducing the number of probes to a number that can be handled in further validation studies of differential expression.

fad3b1f36a65d599d462509ad1a408832cbec79c,Integrative transcriptome network analysis of iPSC-derived neurons from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients with 22q11.2 deletion,"BackgroundIndividuals with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2 DS) are a specific high-risk group for developing schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Several genes in the deleted region have been implicated in the development of SZ, e.g., PRODH and DGCR8. However, the mechanistic connection between these genes and the neuropsychiatric phenotype remains unclear. To elucidate the molecular consequences of 22q11.2 deletion in early neural development, we carried out RNA-seq analysis to investigate gene expression in early differentiating human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of 22q11.2 DS SZ and SAD patients.MethodsEight cases (ten iPSC-neuron samples in total including duplicate clones) and seven controls (nine in total including duplicate clones) were subjected to RNA sequencing. Using a systems level analysis, differentially expressed genes/gene-modules and pathway of interests were identified. Lastly, we related our findings from in vitro neuronal cultures to brain development by mapping differentially expressed genes to BrainSpan transcriptomes.ResultsWe observed ~2-fold reduction in expression of almost all genes in the 22q11.2 region in SZ (37 genes reached p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05, 36 of which reached a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Outside of the deleted region, 745 genes showed significant differences in expression between SZ and control neurons (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Function enrichment and network analysis of the differentially expressed genes uncovered converging evidence on abnormal expression in key functional pathways, such as apoptosis, cell cycle and survival, and MAPK signaling in the SZ and SAD samples. By leveraging transcriptome profiles of normal human brain tissues across human development into adulthood, we showed that the differentially expressed genes converge on a sub-network mediated by CDC45 and the cell cycle, which would be disrupted by the 22q11.2 deletion during embryonic brain development, and another sub-network modulated by PRODH, which could contribute to disruption of brain function during adolescence.ConclusionsThis study has provided evidence for disruption of potential molecular events in SZ patient with 22q11.2 deletion and related our findings from in vitro neuronal cultures to functional perturbations that can occur during brain development in SZ.",2016,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Mingyan Lin"", ids = ""2806791""); list(name = ""Erika Pedrosa"", ids = ""143834850""); list(name = ""Anastasia Hrabovsky"", ids = ""4666840""); list(name = ""Jian Jhen Chen"", ids = ""47740650""); list(name = ""Benjamin R.

53020d73b51fcd51dda9a53e688ff5ceb9f1d8af,An Interleukin 13 Polymorphism Is Associated with Symptom Severity in Adult Subjects with Ever Asthma,"Different genes are associated with categorical classifications of asthma severity. However, continuous outcomes should be used to catch the heterogeneity of asthma phenotypes and to increase the power in association studies. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate gene regions and continuous measures of asthma severity, in adult patients from the general population. In the Gene Environment Interactions in Respiratory Diseases (GEIRD) study (www.geird.org), 326 subjects (aged 20-64) with ever asthma were identified from the general population in Verona (Italy) between 2007 and 2010. A panel of 236 SNPs tagging 51 candidate gene regions (including one or more genes) was analysed. A symptom and treatment score (STS) and pre-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted were used as continuous measures of asthma severity. The association of each SNP with STS and FEV1% predicted was tested by fitting quasi-gamma and linear regression models, respectively, with gender, body mass index and smoking habits as potential confounders. The Simes multiple-test procedure was used for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). SNP rs848 in the IL13 gene region (IL5/RAD50/IL13/IL4) was associated with STS (TG/GG vs TT genotype: uncorrected p-value = 0.00006, FDR-corrected p-value = 0.04), whereas rs20541 in the same gene region, in linkage disequilibrium with rs848 (r(2) = 0.94) in our sample, did not reach the statistical significance after adjusting for multiple testing (TC/CC vs TT: uncorrected p-value = 0.0003, FDR-corrected p-value = 0.09). Polymorphisms in other gene regions showed a non-significant moderate association with STS (IL12B, TNS1) or lung function (SERPINE2, GATA3, IL5, NPNT, FAM13A) only. After adjusting for multiple testing and potential confounders, SNP rs848 in the IL13 gene region is significantly associated with a continuous measure of symptom severity in adult subjects with ever asthma.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simone Accordini"", ids = ""4271093""); list(name = ""Lucia Calciano"", ids = ""4843905""); list(name = ""Cristina Bombieri"", ids = ""3820229""); list(name = ""Giovanni Malerba"", ids = ""48489215""); list(name = ""Francesca Belpinati"", ids = ""5714039""); list(name = ""Anna Rita Lo Presti"", ids = ""49738462""); list(name = ""Alessandro Baldan"", ids = ""39001857""); list(name = ""Marcello Ferrari"", ids = ""49453818""); list(name = ""Luigi Perbellini"", ids = ""4324749""); list(name = ""Roberto de Marco"", ids = ""47838447"")",13f856601d8435eae9855ddf834d0999c82c4d56; 12b7f3b75cdef4bdbabe55e53b3872919de4ed08; 198a0dd232ff3af515cc0bb35277d03540e634f1; 90524b17da3a5ce1afe955095f7dfb558318f711; 2fc02e5eeba5d81fd4b49b6ac328a207474c7042; ac4a2eefb9f2309bd63e8dd5aff3028c64ce16e6; ddc88bbcf0c5bd1ec5ccb986577eec2566661c2a; fceebaa3a5c218ceab479e15c2ec04f44d4d780a; f87240f7c8c8eadb1570128b75311ed0b314ae3a; 6e4701b3398f4aa9d1ebf4722a4bcb1e16405a29,e2fbc8b93a094a885721971284764cad3321b857; 6112062239cf8df3afc50554149d45d7b3fb8a79; b200f329acefb57b434e1d721d04f50d3cd51ea9; 1644aa995450e491819c8564c7cbedcc9782a9af; da2de9157d9f9d278b06044efa74d149f097aa98; 6e06f5b8c22119704994e424928a808eb999be92; 9890e5f8dd2c6ed0042023de431b1fe877b8634c; 7818df5aba6d6ec972ed4e5527be33ee14fabb83; 8d67b8c8ebcff212e497608fa8f6128844176890; 666bff34cd84f555c1cc568fd41b63ce1769f5c7; ac20c317e95b623ea1a9187fbd1f0873e37464bd; 910608711589993a9faa73a847eb191deeb3535f; c9d3a33e7bc1241172cfa7d7b0407bcd59b19e14; 70b77a07edc71797aea3abe32f1617005ec136e9; 22aa8bd29607331d424f2504c432b074f6e42b3f; 3f039a2753b255b831664e352cd8da01f33072e4; 75afae629997b0cbe430fdd0c6e1cdd999341e5b; 8d920711322a992eace840c3da6bbd0d83a120e8; bf335d54096cd95c382f9a6c60b26183b253ff04; 4f0d2f931bc7c15613a843d26ae3f837c184e13b; 4a193543e2b83143c48a5b85aa5fd17f0767e650; 2b0dcadf2a119c84f3f2cc543d6bbaea18d85d6e; 99c46d7cc3bbc778e54117c4468985219f33e137; 69b266bfc55c635d892f1b3288b709963b620c10; 31c5fb4062b994b469203bd967b0bc85cfc3faf6; ad9e0772f0776c6ab97daf2f7eb4742ca79d56c6; ea54f0c0568cab38619ee51e6ac021e76d6a6559; b109c1a1529d5f25659a490c1fe036bca3a1b65c; d10dd1de036400ed2d660c76ad9dae34290bca52; f1037adc38b4808d129ab28d4bc48f03470a396d; 260e4cf8e02bb65a0d989f8d289836e19ac6b75a; 9c4f41efc1dcf4780034fe7fbfba743e91d6b4ae; 7b6515079e158af11791c2983733cb013487c05d; a7616f6939663a96ccc1b0eaff1c03d8c461d4a8; 80cc5beac527ee6c46633129876e1a836f11a48c; 367b1545472745d610ba611ab54c504a40e93179; 7ab3fac989fdb8f94d20c548db9a5d309191eacb; c9e1e928352d7682e8769b7ba2e2270ec20a5c05; 0c2ac6b0e33a7b2bf9624c78db501dde8a087089; 056b44326930311ce57051b63c85f50f998a1f72; 7f7db038619064f8f3de72435247270fd808a2b7; 0c843c61965ffbdda25bbc596e15c75ffd0286fe; 6b310232ca342768a6671170f833d33b08c61f56; 545a0f49907c0344037bf71de7efbff111003340; e4e30b8c4fade1171783a37ce98fbe6ee5dfe711; 81fecc03e76ee2982674af1af257ae2e18003e14; c1ffa78e89491361eb4cbf9ea355ea16d1d0a12b; 478d8495a8a4348e2c78d43dbfd37bdf2820393d; 471a84a463e46ecadc9f5f2ca14c61f1d9e3d596; f58c306a23f5c1cd77b563970c38d53213e9423c; 41f6f97a0001bdebe5ca51939b050e58c2082c32; 4ce2c78502c2dd31258a49843c1e7d31e51535b1,PLoS ONE,11,
0c72464e042a9ef5996e470959f57e1adf56c271,Transcriptomic characterization of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) tumors all carry a deletion of âˆ¼ 400 kb in chromosome 19, resulting in a fusion of the genes for the heat shock protein, DNAJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1, DNAJB1, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. The resulting chimeric transcript produces a fusion protein that retains kinase activity. No other recurrent genomic alterations have been identified. Here we characterize the molecular pathogenesis of FLHCC with transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing). Differential expression (tumor vs. adjacent normal tissue) was detected for more than 3,500 genes (log2 fold change â‰¥ 1, false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.01), many of which were distinct from those found in hepatocellular carcinoma. Expression of several known oncogenes, such as ErbB2 and Aurora Kinase A, was increased in tumor samples. These and other dysregulated genes may serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elana P. Simon"", ids = ""7942067""); list(name = ""Catherine A.

e8872c8cb2f18b5bb3ceb3608ad02742d21aa845,Structure-aided prediction of mammalian transcription factor complexes in conserved non-coding elements,"Mapping the DNA-binding preferences of transcription factor (TF) complexes is critical for deciphering the functions of cis-regulatory elements. Here, we developed a computational method that compares co-occurring motif spacings in conserved versus unconserved regions of the human genome to detect evolutionarily constrained binding sites of rigid TF complexes. Structural data were used to estimate TF complex physical plausibility, explore overlapping motif arrangements seldom tackled by non-structure-aware methods, and generate and analyse three-dimensional models of the predicted complexes bound to DNA. Using this approach, we predicted 422 physically realistic TF complex motifs at 18% false discovery rate, the majority of which (326, 77%) contain some sequence overlap between binding sites. The set of mostly novel complexes is enriched in known composite motifs, predictive of binding site configurations in TFâ€“TFâ€“DNA crystal structures, and supported by ChIP-seq datasets. Structural modelling revealed three cooperativity mechanisms: direct proteinâ€“protein interactions, potentially indirect interactions and â€˜through-DNAâ€™ interactions. Indeed, 38% of the predicted complexes were found to contain four or more bases in which TF pairs appear to synergize through overlapping binding to the same DNA base pairs in opposite grooves or strands.

ea9a1ce756b5e9c763c24d5b9230e9e49a374c0c,Controlling false discoveries in candidate gene studies,"Adjustments for multiple testing are rare in situations where a modest number of markers are typed, such as candidate genes studies. Based on a simulation study, we argue that this can result in a considerable risk of false discoveries, but that a simple and efficient method can be used to counteract this. We noted that in studies where relatively few tests are performed, such as candidate genes studies, adjustments for multiple testing are rare. The reasons are not clear. As few tests are performed compared to linkage (disequilibrium) scans, the risk of false discoveries is perhaps perceived to be small. Geneticists could also be reluctant to correct for multiple testing because this may result in a low power to detect real effects. Furthermore, markers in candidate gene studies are often in linkage disequilibrium and analyzed in multiple ways (eg as single markers or part of haplotypes). Procedures to control false discoveries are sometimes considered inappropriate for such correlated tests. The pattern that emerges from the analyses may sometimes seem meaningful. For instance, finding a more significant haplotype could be viewed as a confirmation that a significant single marker was not a false discovery. Researchers might feel that methods for controlling false discoveries are too conservative since they cannot take this kind of information into account. The same might be true for other forms of â€˜circumstantial evidence,â€™ such as a significant result for markers that are functional or show similar genotypeâ€“phenotype associations in other species. To study the validity of these reasons, we simulated data for 50 000 candidate gene studies based on coalescent processes (details at: http://www.vipbg.vcu.edu/~edwin/). In each study, there were five common SNPs (frequencies40.1), approximately evenly spaced in a 20 kb area. We tested (1) each SNP, (2) the overall haplotype distribution, (3) each common haplotype (frequency42%), and (4) each of the 10 two marker haplotypes. This creates a multiple testing problem with correlated tests. For instance, with four common haplotypes the total number of tests equals 5Ã¾ 1Ã¾4Ã¾101â„420. These tests are correlated because the SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium and the same SNP may be tested as a single marker or part of a haplotype. If all tests with P-values smaller than critical value Pk are rejected, making no adjustment for multiple testing implies Pk1â„4 a. The Bonferroni correction, Pk1â„4 a/m, where m is the number of tests, guarantees that the expected number of studies yielding one or more false discoveries ra. Instead of controlling a number, it may be better to control a false discovery rate (FDR). The FDR equals the expected proportion of false discoveries among all significant tests. For example, FDR1â„4 0.1 means that there will on average be one false discovery for every 10 significant findings. We studied three sequential P-value methods to control the FDR. All are easy to apply by ordering the P-values and then use a simple rule to determine the significant tests. If there are no real effects, the FDR controlled by these methods offers the same â€˜studywiseâ€™ control as the Bonferroni correction. However, these procedures will be more powerful than the Bonferroni correction if there are true effects. The sequential P-value methods may be too liberal with a limited number of tests. We considered other methods that try to remedy this, but they did not work well. The so-called BH procedure controls the FDR at a pre-specified level q for uncorrelated and positively dependent test statistics. If the proportion p0 of tests that do not have effects o1, the procedure is conservative and controls the FDR at level q p0 rather than q. The adaptive procedure remedies this by estimating p0 and then running the BH procedure with q*1â„4 q/p0. Finally, the dependent procedure is known to be less powerful than the BH and adaptive procedure, but is valid under any dependency structure. Table 1 shows that, without a correction for multiple testing, 24.4% of the studies will yield at least one significant result (a1â„45%), whereas in reality there are no effects. Although a bit conservative, all other procedures did control the study-wise error rate at significance level a, despite the highly correlated tests. Least conservative are the BH and adaptive procedures. With the adaptive procedure, 70.9% of the tests were rejected in scenarios where one of the haplotypes carried a disease mutation. This was even better than the 66% rejected tests when the significant level was not adjusted. The explanation is that, if there is a real effect, it will show in multiple tests because the same mutation can influence multiple single-marker and/or haplotype tests.

7a56a81afb0490462a3eebe87c7a7713ea571899,High Dimensional Variable Selection with Error Control,"Background. The iterative sure independence screening (ISIS) is a popular method in selecting important variables while maintaining most of the informative variables relevant to the outcome in high throughput data. However, it not only is computationally intensive but also may cause high false discovery rate (FDR). We propose to use the FDR as a screening method to reduce the high dimension to a lower dimension as well as controlling the FDR with three popular variable selection methods: LASSO, SCAD, and MCP. Method. The three methods with the proposed screenings were applied to prostate cancer data with presence of metastasis as the outcome. Results. Simulations showed that the three variable selection methods with the proposed screenings controlled the predefined FDR and produced high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores. In applying these methods to the prostate cancer example, LASSO and MCP selected 12 and 8 genes and produced AUROC scores of 0.746 and 0.764, respectively. Conclusions. We demonstrated that the variable selection methods with the sequential use of FDR and ISIS not only controlled the predefined FDR in the final models but also had relatively high AUROC scores.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sangjin Kim"", ids = ""48388854""); list(name = ""Susan Halabi"", ids = ""143717041"")",af7f496d74eae8d39ce3b41f69742636cf2c9b6b; 6aa8cdfbc36cf6ebf40c00da87c28491e6a109c2; 854d7a2532fb59bebba38833f95825da42bfd17f; 778d4471b3b02c83cb7fd87b17f771dd90ee1847; 7e9059930f99675ab9b473fa65e45e267412a2bd,1f2a3e620a9f8de6010dbcfb124014d7d7532630; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; be7c282222328c95376f752a1bb26c6c8f2463e0; efb43bbfd7ee05a4b60b511dc0a75a3ae1339ea0; a76f5e42847c0197e5745f383b38af55f6242d68; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 5f5bbfc164ffde5a124b738fd0de6f3c1e34a390; 19f90a8c59b2b5924debf81fc38c53f2f445b236; 7c648476ed5add5ba466ea0be1c2a0e4ad2dc2c9; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 0bfd57b42c4620d3f51d0c75a3919eb9c7b73e83; f865520d2c4edda2a5e7138cc18487ed5fa9f722; 8dbffeab095e42a686f6ab0bd23daa70c33ae2c0; 012bdc01b6065abae1b0932cfbf5229adbe8eebb; 5c8ce1c3e69185589c919ef47ca423a3da5b4112; 6f63b4fad9f4a919b0a2563d7b4dde1e49dd322c; 112e2d4f6ffbfba004576a159ffdf60f5dad8d3a; 9770a7533de2f1a867d25d99e9ea6977802e222b; de6556abad53c37d90ea28b673591a7e64ffc660; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; f2a315c121b87e0896b07df445ad25007de69269,BioMed Research International,2016,
dfdddb72233fed8fe692352fa16c755adfb142cd,Structure Learning of Gaussian Markov Random Fields with False Discovery Rate Control,"In this paper, we propose a new estimation procedure for discovering the structure of Gaussian Markov random fields (MRFs) with false discovery rate (FDR) control, making use of the sorted l 1 -norm (SL1) regularization. A Gaussian MRF is an acyclic graph representing a multivariate Gaussian distribution, where nodes are random variables and edges represent the conditional dependence between the connected nodes. Since it is possible to learn the edge structure of Gaussian MRFs directly from data, Gaussian MRFs provide an excellent way to understand complex data by revealing the dependence structure among many inputs features, such as genes, sensors, users, documents, etc. In learning the graphical structure of Gaussian MRFs, it is desired to discover the actual edges of the underlying but unknown probabilistic graphical modelâ€”it becomes more complicated when the number of random variables (features) p increases, compared to the number of data points n. In particular, when p â‰« n , it is statistically unavoidable for any estimation procedure to include false edges. Therefore, there have been many trials to reduce the false detection of edges, in particular, using different types of regularization on the learning parameters. Our method makes use of the SL1 regularization, introduced recently for model selection in linear regression. We focus on the benefit of SL1 regularization that it can be used to control the FDR of detecting important random variables. Adapting SL1 for probabilistic graphical models, we show that SL1 can be used for the structure learning of Gaussian MRFs using our suggested procedure nsSLOPE (neighborhood selection Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation), controlling the FDR of detecting edges.",2019,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sangkyun Lee"", ids = ""39525147""); list(name = ""Piotr Sobczyk"", ids = ""47367761""); list(name = ""Malgorzata Bogdan"", ids = ""144726010"")",,,Symmetry,11,1311

Major advances have been achieved in the characterization of early breast cancer (eBC) genomic profiles. Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is associated with poor outcomes, yet limited information is available on the genomic profile of this disease. This study aims to decipher mutational profiles of mBC using next-generation sequencing.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 216 tumor-blood pairs from mBC patients who underwent a biopsy in the context of the SAFIR01, SAFIR02, SHIVA, or Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment Optimization (MOSCATO) prospective trials. Mutational profiles from 772 primary breast tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as a reference for comparing primary and mBC mutational profiles. Twelve genes (TP53, PIK3CA, GATA3, ESR1, MAP3K1, CDH1, AKT1, MAP2K4, RB1, PTEN, CBFB, and CDKN2A) were identified as significantly mutated in mBC (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1). Eight genes (ESR1, FSIP2, FRAS1, OSBPL3, EDC4, PALB2, IGFN1, and AGRN) were more frequently mutated in mBC as compared to eBC (FDR < 0.01). ESR1 was identified both as a driver and as a metastatic gene (n = 22, odds ratio = 29, 95% CI [9-155], p = 1.2e-12) and also presented with focal amplification (n = 9) for a total of 31 mBCs with either ESR1 mutation or amplification, including 27 hormone receptor positive (HR+) and HER2 negative (HER2-) mBCs (19%). HR+/HER2- mBC presented a high prevalence of mutations on genes located on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (TSC1 and TSC2) as compared to HR+/HER2- eBC (respectively 6% and 0.7%, p = 0.0004). Other actionable genes were more frequently mutated in HR+ mBC, including ERBB4 (n = 8), NOTCH3 (n = 7), and ALK (n = 7). Analysis of mutational signatures revealed a significant increase in APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in HR+/HER2- metastatic tumors as compared to primary TCGA samples (p < 2e-16). The main limitations of this study include the absence of bone metastases and the size of the cohort, which might not have allowed the identification of rare mutations and their effect on survival.


CONCLUSIONS
This work reports the results of the analysis of the first large-scale study on mutation profiles of mBC.

b1f74feefadcfda8d03f6d23681def91056f2af1,An averaging strategy to reduce variability in target-decoy estimates of false discovery rate,"Decoy database search with target-decoy competition (TDC) provides an intuitive, easy-to-implement method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with spectrum identifications from shotgun proteomics data. However, the procedure can yield different results for a fixed dataset analyzed with different decoy databases, and this decoy-induced variability is particularly problematic for smaller FDR thresholds, datasets or databases. In such cases, the nominal FDR might be 1% but the true proportion of false discoveries might be 10%. The averaged TDC protocol combats this problem by exploiting multiple independently shuffled decoy databases to provide an FDR estimate with reduced variability. We provide a tutorial introduction to aTDC, describe an improved variant of the protocol that offers increased statistical power, and discuss how to deploy aTDC in practice using the Crux software toolkit.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Uri Keich"", ids = ""2864261""); list(name = ""Kaipo Tamura"", ids = ""3270190""); list(name = ""William Stafford Noble"", ids = ""1600667275"")",9d4e77b6d2487bdd6edcd9826ca039a4341fdc3d; a9162101067775b25bb95bd835d9d77c84cda28f,0333223dd7a1c5fa823cc5e94c24da6dae6bf94c; 784d5c09cafeaea5a8d269827ce0906c370920d3; 8bcc83b75eb2b9aa74991677c89262dd1b6bf67f; 6544a071b7896f654d38d9b7b3e5404436c34f60; 3320d3f1e79fb734c356e0482d57f2fbb061ccfd; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 8c1a1e761b715b23668b4f850e2bcc958fa21ad2; 6cba8b457ea7520357ade5d24d393004d36765f6; cb84bccc93b19f5b90cfe8e719fe67e4db0c5149; 3213793dc120ef6583f71125c0e92e323471d0bc; fa39fb914d6c8eea01ef04ae5953e170010928fa; 3d744cf9d758aa51e47a946af4447daf26cec1d6; 515b21be02a525b8364a2ec438ad30f903e62dbc; 1902c72e0beb6e601c8ef842686c4353f8c56f64; 958005b26767ea3c2661487222758a1eac162331; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515; 0d7ba2f3111674bc3957d51188768b76387a2f1a; 1f50f651b32791d4d9e44d99dda8fa8c92bd35e7; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; c90be9508cd2c56d6e04c6c708fe8a866639a1be,bioRxiv,,
d1570cf4de13fd5e038b2fd57c6063d1a068c41e,DNA Methylation Profiles in Whole Blood of Huntington's Disease Patients,"Epigenetic mechanisms, especially DNA methylation, are suggested to play a role in the age-of-onset in Huntington's disease (HD) based on studies on patient brains, and cellular and animal models. Methylation is tissue-specific and it is not clear how HD specific methylation in the brain correlates with the blood compartment, which represents a much more clinically accessible sample. Therefore, we explored the presence of HD specific DNA methylation patterns in whole blood on a cohort of HDM and healthy controls from Slovenia. We compared CpG site-specific DNA methylation in whole blood of 11 symptomatic and 9 pre-symptomatic HDM (HDM), and 15 healthy controls, by using bisulfite converted DNA on the InfiniumÂ® Human Methylation27 BeadChip microarray (Illumina) covering 27,578 CpG sites and 14,495 genes. Of the examined 14,495 genes, 437 were differentially methylated (p < 0.01) in pre-symptomatic HDM compared to controls, with three genes (CLDN16, DDC, NXT2) retaining statistical significance after the correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.05). Comparisons between symptomatic HDM and controls, and the comparison of symptomatic and pre-symptomatic HDM further identified 260 and 198 differentially methylated genes (p < 0.01), respectively, whereas the comparison of all HDM (symptomatic and pre-symptomatic) and healthy controls identified 326 differentially methylated genes (p < 0.01), however, none of these changes retained significance (FDR < 0.05) after the correction for multiple testing. The results of our study suggest that methylation signatures in the blood compartment are not robust enough to prove as valuable biomarkers for predicting HD progression, but recognizable changes in methylation deserve further research.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maja Zadel"", ids = ""152378303""); list(name = ""Ales Maver"", ids = ""1827437""); list(name = ""Anja Kovanda"", ids = ""6432975""); list(name = ""Borut Peterlin"", ids = ""34419181"")",0970ee7f4e849c94f3ee8d9e491b3ec8522435b6; 3b9ea5da66c09bda1879fa4488e6736a5f25fec0; d9dea10e2b2a8d8ca8a6d0ac1726250ba75b3394,5749bb9d1aaccabc78a9a564e5640571c580aa0a; beb9931476e69a15ccda327a88bff371b7124d58; 47661acc507387c5d4de447493481bb376f88728; fd495d6cf7c3169bc58550fdf32be6e16e2800f8; c7e6d7b8733bf66072db0c20fdac5dfdf95eee23; ea1464d1095a8955015f54e714e456a0cd477715; c1470d1b6302f7a5bb0911ac40179d940e10b232; 133739a6638641c7de7966667284e1f54a233950; ac8328efb827d7aa12607fbfabe0e437b6679c9c; 1410efbde43e882c6ecdfa101110da60a9efb3c4; 1717e65a324c8202bed9a2660f3ba3353b9b0659; 9a6c8ebc00661f1feca80b28a0c71a1e0d8da331; 60a98d0dcaa91f277e13b8cde328914a17800e9e; 56472d53f306282c47f8d4f6dc56019e23749974; 4e80500f49c98f3980d7fe4220aefe56dfc1ca37; a03e2bce31b5c942ab4e60232bed367c71c9bbcc; 9ff41b30047970280a13133816efde22726ba861; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; d57f4a848f17cb5286028d57b11aa24e4397439c; c2b9033f0dfd06c124769b128dda1927c46e29a3; e0889dbef520cf708a61dbf6b414abbc41dc29ab; e74129ef4bc229db8bc7020dbdef6e79b03ce8db; d23761c41d0f795c15e71032cf81e6d9e7f3ea91; 6b336c3800ad4026c0e73fc6f799c8c65ff55c8d; 967fd3d96cfb313494bca09e74ec41626c44611c; 8e3f59f0667da728b5a842aa7d9aa750c855c61b; bc4afcf41e7f14cb6be436a3ad02f682a3e5d7f6; 537b81979b5e43b7717d6bfbcf793b69f786201f; 767557b5d54467fd6051db172cdb729d2cfd8932; 3a230688d6b969782cb12b82f152c3a66f7113b4; 3a97cc20f2d4c09e6c7337b66ad5fd29ed4b3ffa; fda4fdf677d2c9ee66b0f5aff45d9a00e9f4d5c1; 8d5c1f5cdc5890964fdea702b84a571db0f5b985; a592c9f08757c66272b8590b3aa5b2876af8f2d8; be027564edbdb7b754d383335b8c15c540e2ce8c; bef4909775f82178e956407c2e24f83c10908cb3; 3e734b7dca7dba5292750d236baf040676caebfa,Frontiers in Neurology,9,
9274e17ef26e6bc60d14ae7cd4d262af8d272e69,Common variants in cardiac ion channel genes are associated with sudden cardiac death.,"BACKGROUND
Rare variants in cardiac ion channel genes are associated with sudden cardiac death in rare primary arrhythmic syndromes; however, it is unknown whether common variation in these same genes may contribute to sudden cardiac death risk at the population level.


METHODS AND RESULTS
We examined the association between 147 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (137 tag, 5 noncoding SNPs associated with QT interval duration, and 5 nonsynonymous SNPs) in 5 cardiac ion channel genes, KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2, and sudden and/or arrhythmic death in a combined nested case-control analysis among 516 cases and 1522 matched control subjects of European ancestry enrolled in 6 prospective cohort studies. After accounting for multiple testing, 2 SNPs (rs2283222 located in intron 11 in KCNQ1 and rs11720524 located in intron 1 in SCN5A) remained significantly associated with sudden/arrhythmic death (false discovery rate=0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Each increasing copy of the major T-allele of rs2283222 or the major C-allele of rs1172052 was associated with an odds ratio of 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.60; P=0.0002) and 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.51; P=0.0005), respectively. Control for cardiovascular risk factors and/or limiting the analysis to definite sudden cardiac death did not significantly alter these relationships.


CONCLUSION
In this combined analysis of 6 prospective cohort studies, 2 common intronic variants in KCNQ1 and SCN5A were associated with sudden cardiac death in individuals of European ancestry. Further study in other populations and investigation into the functional abnormalities associated with noncoding variation in these genes may lead to important insights into predisposition to lethal arrhythmias.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christine M.

4ce700af375f52d67d1a253997d898d1d79dab20,Abstract 4673: Host genetic polymorphisms at TIMP3 are associated with survival of patients with adenocarcinoma of esophagus and gastoeophageal junction,"BACKGROUND: During the past two decades, several countries have experienced a dramatic increase in adenocarcinoma incidence for both the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Because of this increase and generally poor survival, distal esophageal and GEJ adenocarcinomas are important in cancer research. Similarities and shared prognostic factors suggest these cancers can be considered a single neoplastic entity in many contexts. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual uses â€œsingle-stage groupingâ€ across the entire lower esophagus and GEJ area. The current study was conducted to examine the effect of polymorphism at TIMP and MMP genes as a host-related prognosis factor. METHODS: This study used a prospective cohort of patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ in British Columbia (BC) admitted to the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA). Germline DNA was extracted from patientsâ€™ blood or saliva. Selected SNPs were genotyped using Sequenom multiplex iPLEX Gold assays. Patient characteristics and clinical information were obtained from BCCA medical charts and preadmission questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the effect of SNPs adjusted for patient age, tumour location, disease stage and treatment received. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The false discovery rate (FDR) method was applied to address multiple comparisons. RESULTS: 4 genetic polymorphism at TIMP3 gene were associated with survival of patients. These associations were also observed after adjustment for patient age, tumour location, disease stage and treatment received. A SNP in the promoter region of TIMP3 (rs1962223) was associated with about a 3-fold increase in the HR for patients who carried the CG genotype. A tagSNP (rs130274) showed a more than 3-fold increased HR for the dominant and codominant models and 2-fold increased HR for the additive model. A tagSNP (rs715572) was associated with about a 3-fold increased HR for the dominant and codominant models and a 2-fold reduction in the HR for the additive model. Finally, a tagSNP (rs5754312) was associated with a 4-fold reduction in the HR in the recessive and codominant model, and a 2-fold reduction in the HR for the additive model, In haplotype analysis, a block including rs5754312 and rs715572 showed significant association with the patientsâ€™ survival (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ are deadly diseases that are often diagnosed at a stage when the treatment options are limited and have limited effectiveness. Modeling survival based on host factors including genetic polymorphisms is an emerging field in cancer research. Compared to tumour, the patient9s constitutional genetic material is relatively easy to obtain, and can be assessed before treatment is started.

8660f7275703d152b0d5809f81c3dc2c8d027d99,Influence of Maternal Folic Acid Supplementation on Hematopoietic Factors in Offspring.,"Observational studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have generally supported a protective role for maternal intake of foods or vitamins rich in folic acid during pregnancy. Using C57BL/6J mice, we evaluated the effect of dietary folic acid intake in the perigestational period on surface marker and gene expression in B-lineage cells as a potential model to further elucidate the role of maternal diet in the etiology of childhood ALL. Thirty-six female mice were randomized to one of three folic-acid varied diets (low=0.3, control=2.0, high=8.0 mg/kg) one month prior to mating and maintained on the diet until pup weaning at three weeks. Reproductive characteristics and offspring red blood cell (RBC) folate were recorded, and bone marrow lymphocytes were isolated for surface marker characterization by flow cytometry. For gene expression analyses, CD19 positive B-lineage bone marrow cells were purified from three pups per dietary group using anti-CD19 microbeads. Gene expression levels were interrogated using the Agilent mouse whole genome microarray. No statistically significant differences were found among dietary groups with respect to mating success, litter size, estimated 21 day offspring weights, or the percentage of male offspring. However, there were significant differences among the 3 diets in offspring survival to the end of the experiment (39%, 84%, and 30% for the 0.3, 2.0, and 8.0 mg/kg groups, respectively). Pup RBC folate values were positively correlated with dietary folic acid dose with mean values of 428, 615, and 724 ng/ml, respectively. Mice were euthanized at 3 weeks. There was no significant difference in the expression of CD19, IgM, or kappa light chains on bone marrow lymphocytes in the offspring among dietary groups. ANOVA analysis, using Genedata Expressionist Pro software, showed differential expression of 267 genes using a Benjamini and Hochburg false discovery rate cutoff of 10%. Three main patterns of gene expression between pups of different dietary groups were identified through unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis; 152 and 86 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in both the high and the low folic acid groups relative to the control group. Twenty-seven genes showed increasing expression with increasing dietary folic acid dose. In conclusion, dietary folic acid given to dams prior to conception through weaning had a significant effect on offspring survival and gene expression. Additional analyses are underway to determine the relevance of genes found to be differentially expressed with respect to risk of B-cell lineage leukemias followed by validation of relevant gene candidates through quantitative RT-PCR.

Genomic profiling of lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) using microarrays has led to increased understanding of AD and identification of novel therapeutic targets. However, the limitations of microarrays might decrease detection of AD genes. These limitations might be lessened with next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).


OBJECTIVE
We sought to define the lesional AD transcriptome using RNA-seq and compare it using microarrays performed on the same cohort.


METHODS
RNA-seq and microarrays were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (criteria: fold change, â‰¥ 2.0; false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05) in lesional versus nonlesional skin from 18 patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry used for validation.


RESULTS
Both platforms showed robust disease transcriptomes and correlated well with RT-PCR. The common AD transcriptome identified by using both techniques contained 217 genes, including inflammatory (S100A8/A9/A12, CXCL1, and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-like [OASL]) and barrier (MKi67, keratin 16 [K16], and claudin 8 [CLDN8]) AD-related genes. Although fold change estimates determined by using RNA-seq showed somewhat better agreement with RT-PCR (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.57 and 0.70 for microarrays and RNA-seq vs RT-PCR, respectively), bias was not eliminated. Among genes uniquely identified by using RNA-seq were triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) signaling (eg, CCL2, CCL3, and single immunoglobulin domain IL1R1 related [SIGIRR]) and IL-36 isoform genes. TREM-1 is a surface receptor implicated in innate and adaptive immunity that amplifies infection-related inflammation.


CONCLUSIONS
This is the first report of a lesional AD phenotype using RNA-seq and the first direct comparison between platforms in this disease. Both platforms robustly characterize the AD transcriptome. Through RNA-seq, we unraveled novel disease pathology, including increased expression of the novel TREM-1 pathway and the IL-36 cytokine in patients with AD.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mayte SuÃ¡rez-FariÃ±as"", ids = ""14842374""); list(name = ""Benjamin Ungar"", ids = ""48462903""); list(name = ""Joel Correa da Rosa"", ids = ""3267821""); list(name = ""David Adrian Ewald"", ids = ""8546925""); list(name = ""Mariya Rozenblit"", ids = ""5046686""); list(name = ""Juana GonzÃ¡lez"", ids = ""121597773""); list(name = ""Hui Xu"", ids = ""145305531""); list(name = ""X Zheng"", ids = ""90460818""); list(name = ""Xiangyu Peng"", ids = ""2325654""); list(name = ""Yeriel D.

49f13bbcb7503dab9c1bdd412d3a46be8480f835,Abstract A1-24: DNA methylation sequencing of prostate tumors: Possible molecular mechanisms for cancer aggressiveness,"A major challenge in the clinical management of prostate cancer is the inability to definitively diagnose indolent versus aggressive cases. Contributing to this challenge is a lack of basic science understanding of the molecular basis behind aggressiveness subtypes in prostate cancer. DNA methylation is the epigenetic addition of a methyl group to the DNA base cytosine and has been found to regulate cell proliferation and environmental adaptation. We hypothesized that DNA methylation changes are a mechanism by which an aggressive cancer attains phenotypes that distinguish it from indolent cases via disruption of regulatory networks. This hypothesis was tested by comparing DNA methylation between benign prostate and both low grade (Gleason score 6) and high grade (Gleason score 8 to 10) groups. Methylome-wide next generation sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from radical prostatectomy cases using MBD-isolated genome sequencing (MiGS). Global clustering analyses showed some separation between the three groups, but also indicated some heterogeneity. Specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected between the three groups. The two most prevalent were hypermethylation specific to high grade (491 DMRs at 4% false discovery rate) and hypermethylation shared between both cancer subtypes (1334 DMRs at 1% false discovery rate). Statistical and computational analysis of this data set was non-trivial and the software developed to perform the analysis has been made available. High grade specific DMRs are abundant in intergenic and gene body contexts, and occur less frequently in promoters and CpG islands than DMRs shared between both subtypes. Intergenic DMRs are enriched for putative functional elements (ChIP-seq peaks and DNaseI hypersensitive sites from the ENCODE project) suggesting that these changes may have functional impacts as local or regional enhancers regulating multiple genes. To analyze this in more detail, DNA-protein binding sites for specific factors were compared between 5 spatial contexts. Differential patterns of enrichment were observed for regulatory binding factors between promoters, intergenic regions, and gene 39 ends. A de novo motif search revealed 8 frequent sequence motifs in intergenic DMRs that are not similar to any known binding motifs, indicating possible binding sites for as yet unknown factors. For DMRs that are proximal to genes, an interaction network based on curated pathway data was built using the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin. Gene ontology enrichment was observed for â€œpositive regulation of cell motilityâ€ (Q-value=1.4e-07, 22 of 296 genes in term) and â€œregulatory region DNA bindingâ€ (Q-value=6.7e-07, 18 of 255 genes in term) within this network. Interestingly, each GO term appears as a distinct cluster on the interaction network. While the specific regulatory action of these DMRs and exact target genes in aggressive cancer remains to be determined experimentally, this work has established the presence of focal hypermethylation that distinguishes indolent and aggressive prostate cancer. The high frequency of intergenic but functionally enriched genomic contexts and functional enrichment of these DMRs at genic sites for transcription factors suggests that they regulate aggressiveness in a complex manner through secondary and tertiary effects. This study provides a first glimpse at molecular differences between indolent and aggressive prostate and future work may lead to the development of biomarkers and treatments based on this knowledge.

8de1371986040e0b7e869c8f426e2df222098b18,Sa43: Are Some Maltreated Individuals 'immune' to Later Life Depression? an Investigation of 41 Inflammatory Markers in over 600 U.k. Adults,"Background Childhood maltreatment is widely reported across the world and the incidence of child cruelty and neglect offences is reportedly on the rise. Childhood maltreatment is strongly associated with a range of negative health outcomes in adulthood and represents the strongest environmental risk factor for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Immuno-inflammatory activation is one biological mechanism activated in response to maltreatment, and a possible mediator of this increased risk for MDD. Immune modulators, such as the inflammatory cytokines are reported to be increased in patients with MDD and play a role in brain development, neurogenesis and synaptic remodelling. We hypothesize that: (i) maltreatment subtypes will have effects on specific inflammatory markers in adulthood; and (ii) maltreatment will have differential effects on inflammatory markers in adulthood depending on whether or not an individual develops MDD. Methods 616 U.K. participants (276 MDD cases and 340 controls) were recruited as part the South East London Community Health Study (SELCoH) and the Antiglucocorticoid augmentation (metyrapone) of antiDepressants in Depression (ADD) Study. MDD status was defined using either DSM-IV, or the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (which generates ICD-10 diagnoses). Childhood maltreatment was determined using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and ordinal measures of maltreatment subtype severity were generated. The expression of 41 inflammatory markers were quantified using multiplex electrochemiluminescence methods applied to participant serum samples. General linear models were used to investigate the main effects of maltreatment severity on immune marker expression, and MDD case-control by maltreatment interactions whilst covarying for a broad range of potential confounders. Within each test we performed, we corrected for the number of inflammatory markers assessed using the False Discovery Rate (q Results 34 out of 41 inflammatory markers were expressed in over 70% of our sample, and these were carried forward into downstream analyses. Main effect analyses showed that a higher severity of emotional neglect in childhood was associated with higher Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D (VEGF-D) levels in adulthood (q Discussion VEGF-D is a cytokine responsible for vascularisation and angiogenesis. The effect we observed was irrespective of MDD case-control status, suggesting that if higher levels of VEGF-D levels do have a long-lasting impact on health, this may relate to disorders other than MDD, or it requires interaction with other factors to lead to MDD. Our MDD case-control by maltreatment interaction analyses revealed heightened levels of IL-12p70 in control subjects relative to depressed cases in association with emotional and physical neglect severity. IL-12p70 has been shown to have neuroprotective properties and we hypothesise that this marker may be involved in a mechanism which confers resilience to MDD in response to childhood neglect, or that it represents a biological proxy for a protective environmental factor (e.g. social support). Further work is now needed to understand if IL12p70 represents a novel drug target to treat MDD in those who have experienced childhood neglect.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Alish B.

4acac3c0c67f6bfc8937d33b1c18796371eff279,Error-Pooling Empirical Bayes Model for Enhanced Statistical Discovery of Differential Expression in Microarray Data,"A number of statistical approaches have been proposed for evaluating the statistical significance of a differential expression in microarray data. The error estimation of these approaches is inaccurate when the number of replicated arrays is small. Consequently, their resulting statistics are often underpowered to detect important differential expression patterns in the microarray data with limited replication. In this paper, we propose an empirical Bayes (EB) heterogeneous error model (HEM) with error-pooling prior specifications for varying technical and biological errors in the microarray data. The error estimation of HEM is thus strengthened by and shrunk toward the EB priors that are obtained by the error-pooling estimation at each local intensity range. By using simulated and real data sets, we compared HEM with two widely used statistical approaches, significance analysis of microarray (SAM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA), to identify differential expression patterns across multiple conditions. The comparison showed that HEM is statistically more powerful than SAM and ANOVA, particularly when the sample size is smaller than five. We also suggest a resampling-based estimation of Bayesian false discovery rate to provide a biologically relevant cutoff criterion of HEM statistics.",2008,Computer Science,"list(name = ""HyungJun Cho"", ids = ""40115190""); list(name = ""Jae K.

While this is well known, the downstream consequences of misalignment have not been fully characterized. Â We assessed the potential for incorrect alignment of RNA-sequencing reads to cause false positives in both gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and co-expression analyses. Trans-eQTLs identified from human RNA-sequencing studies appeared to be particularly affected by this phenomenon, even when only uniquely aligned reads are considered. Over 75\% of trans-eQTLs using a standard pipeline occurred between regions of sequence similarity and therefore could be due to alignment errors. Further, associations due to mapping errors are likely to misleadingly replicate between studies. To help address this problem, we quantified the potential for ""cross-mapping'' to occur between every pair of annotated genes in the human genome. Such cross-mapping data can be used to filter or flag potential false positives in both trans-eQTL and co-expression analyses. Such filtering substantially alters the detection of significant associations and can have an impact on the assessment of false discovery rate, functional enrichment, and replication for RNA-sequencing association studies.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashis Saha"", ids = ""47162528""); list(name = ""Alexis Battle"", ids = ""145086335"")",f9b41791205c65aa7a2ad60fc123aedbd3b4dd90; 0c79a2a61e97c67404b49f6bdc05c8d4bddfb0d4; 37cef0dcc01f4c311b6dc4058b0a3833846c10b7; 2c439120dee8f9498fa19692e0e0e73b5980cb9f; cc57792343b037d6c55e2f02c004d7a02f4c4a51; 68beecafdcece99835ef45c82dd90d8e0d8e1973; 2ba54a8ee5e0b356db9a8dbc23101c39b31acebc; e254b0ff90ed6992dbfbf63970552d29cde8efc8; 432e0f6e0f8122d535e0c650458c210dcad30499,199242477948c496ea5a4766bec03d5c5649d884,F1000Research,7,

Les relations entre les SNPs et la severite des lentigines solaires ont ete etudies par des regressions lineaires ajustees sur lâ€™Ã¢ge, lâ€™indice de masse corporelle, le tabagisme, lâ€™exposition solaire au cours de la vie, le statut hormonal, et les deux principaux vecteurs propres issus de la stratification de la population. Lâ€™imputation des alleles HLA classe I et II ont ete realisees a lâ€™aide du logiciel SNP2HLA. Resultats Un groupe de 9 SNPs, localises sur le chromosome 6, presentent un signal inferieur a un False discovery rate de 25Â %. Ces SNPs se regroupent en deux blocs distincts. Un de ces blocs est a lâ€™interieur de la region HLA. Les alleles mineurs de ces SNPs sont associes avec un score de lentigines solaires plus faible et avec une expression moindre de HLA-C. Ces SNPs sont egalement en desequilibre de liaisons avec lâ€™allele HLA-C*0701 ( r 2 Â =Â 0,95). Lâ€™autre bloc, correspond a des SNPs inter-geniques et sont situes a 11 megabases de la region HLA. Ces derniers SNPs presentent un lien avec la severite des lentigines sur le front qui passe le seuil de Bonferroni ( p Â =Â 1,37Â Ã—Â 10 âˆ’8 ). Ces signaux sont conserves lorsque les autres SNPs sont ajoutes comme covariables dans lâ€™analyse. Discussion Notre etude a mis en evidence un lien entre la severite des lentigines, HLA et lâ€™immunite. La presence de lâ€™allele HLA-C*0701 est associee avec une meilleure reponse des lymphocytes CD8+ au melanome. Cet allele pourrait donc jouer un role protecteur dans le developpement des lentigines solaires. Cependant, la diminution de lâ€™expression du gene HLA-C suggere un mecanisme plus complexe. Conclusion Ces resultats sont a confirmer par des etudes de replication. De plus, il serait necessaire de mener une analyse moleculaire plus precise ou une recherche dâ€™interactions genetiques devrait egalement etre conduite afin de mieux comprendre la relation entre lâ€™immunite et le developpement de lentigines solaires.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Vincent Laville"", ids = ""3433597""); list(name = ""Sigrid Le Clerc"", ids = ""12822780""); list(name = ""Khaled Ezzedine"", ids = ""4914827""); list(name = ""Irina Berlin"", ids = ""26635589""); list(name = ""Wassila Carpentier"", ids = ""6981001""); list(name = ""Randa Jdid"", ids = ""6259035""); list(name = ""Pilar Galan"", ids = ""145727825""); list(name = ""Serge Hercberg"", ids = ""48389484""); list(name = ""Christiane Guinot"", ids = ""3258552""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©rique Morizot"", ids = ""50745363""); list(name = ""Jean Latreille"", ids = ""119827790""); list(name = ""Erwin Tschachler"", ids = ""49646156""); list(name = ""Jean-FranÃ§ois Zagury"", ids = ""41182364"")",c255915ec4726ae29493a5b1be87c97030e0d43a,,Annales De Dermatologie Et De Venereologie,141,
e900f5681a9fb5e9ec8cd8b77a310d490555483e,"Assessment of mRNA, protein levels and activities of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in colon and rectal mucosa of colorectal cancer patients","Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common type of gastrointestinal cancer and a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Today we know that exposure to exogenous chemicals (xenobiotics) combined with a modified ability to detoxify carcinogens increases the risk of developing cancer. Xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) play a major role in the activation and detoxification of several carcinogens but their expression and activity in human colorectal tissue as well as their role in the development of CRC has not been sufficiently explored. In order to shed light on this question, this study aimed to link XME metabolism, lifestyle and risk factors with the etiology of CRC investigating two different aims. Therefore, the thesis is split into two parts: 
 
1) Evaluation of mRNA, protein and enzyme activities of relevant phase I and phase II xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in normal colorectal tissue of colorectal cancer patients: In this study, three different layers of XME abundance (mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity) were evaluated in cytochromes P450 (CYPs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), protein expression evaluated by immunoassay detection, and enzymatic activities measured by biochemical assays, in the normal tissue of 97 patients with CRC. The mean relative expression levels in normal colorectal tissue were highest for GSTP1 [mean (Â± standard deviation): 7.70 (0.60)] and lowest for GSTM1 [mean: 4.08 (1.80)]. Associations of xenobiotic metabolism-related gene expression, protein level and enzyme activities with clinical parameters in patients with CRC, were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results of the univariate analysis revealed a 1.2-fold lower UGT1A8 expression and 1.7-fold lower UGT activity in normal tissue of rectal compared to colon cancer patients (p=0.008; pFDR=0.34 and p=0.002; pFDR=0.17, respectively). Furthermore, lower GSTP1 expression levels among recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) users compared to non-users (p=0.04; pFDR=0.58) were detected. Associations with lifestyle and dietary factors were evaluated using linear regression models. Results of the multivariable models adjusted for relevant covariables, showed that regular consumption (>1x/week) of cooked vegetables was associated with higher CYP3A4 protein levels (Î²=5.62, pn=0.009; pFDR=0.65) and regular consumption of raw vegetables was associated with lower UGT activities (Î²=-0.56; pn=0.03; pFDR=0.72) compared to non-regular consumption 
of raw and cooked vegetables (â‰¤ 1x/week) in the normal mucosa of CRC patients. 
 
Relation of mRNA expression, protein levels and enzyme activities were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficients. No statistically significant associations were found between mRNA expression and neither protein levels, nor enzymatic activities for the CYPs and GSTs. For the UGTs, statistically significant, albeit weak, positive associations between UGT1A8 protein and mRNA abundance (r=0.20, pâ‰¤ 0.05) and UGT1A10 mRNA levels and UGT activity (r=0.28, p â‰¤0.01) were observed. However, between UGT1A10 protein level and UGT activity, a statistically significant negative correlation (r= -0.27, p â‰¤0.01) was detected. 
 
2) Evaluation of differentially expressed XMEs in normal and tumor colorectal tissue: The expression of eight selected XMEs (GSTP1, GSTA1, GSTM1, UGT1A10, UGT1A8, CYP2W1, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4) in colorectal carcinomas and adjacent normal mucosa (n=71) was compared and associations of sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary factors with the expression of these genes were investigated. Differences between XMEsâ€™ gene expression (IlluminaHT-12 Expression BeadChips) in tumor and normal mucosa were tested by the paired Wilcoxon-Rank-sum test. Among the genes analyzed, GSTM1, GSTA1, UGT1A8, UGT1A10, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 were down-regulated in tumor tissue as compared to normal tissue, while GSTP1 and CYP2W1 were up-regulated. Linear regression models were used to evaluate potential associations between sociodemographic, lifestyle and dietary factors and the relative gene expression in tumor and normal mucosa tissue. Although none of these relationships remained statistically significant after false discovery rate (FDR)-adjustment for multiple testing, a trend toward significance (Î²=-0.21; pn=0.0005; pFDR=0.05) with lower CYP2C9 expression in normal tissue of rectal compared to colon cancer patients was detected. CYP2C9 plays a key role in the metabolic activation of many environmental and dietary mutagens and interactions of its expression with these factors should be considered in larger studies. 
 
Overall conclusions: In summary, it can be concluded that in normal tissue of CRC patients: 
- Correlations between XMEsâ€™ mRNA, protein and enzyme activities are moderate to poor 
- Colon and rectum showed considerable differences regarding expression and activities of several XMEs 
- Regular consumption of cooked vegetables was associated with CYP3A4 gene expression and protein levels 
Taken together, the results of this thesis suggest some interesting differences, which should be considered in larger studies to elucidate its potential contribution to CRC etiology.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Jolantha Beyerle"", ids = ""12558938"")",,,,,
d361af8b3662e34abaae93ec98240bcb7f61932d,Genetic Polymorphisms in Vitamin D Metabolism and Signaling Genes and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Nested Case-Control Study,"Genetic polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism and signaling genes have been inconsistently associated with risk of breast cancer, though few studies have examined SNPs in vitamin D-related genes other than the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene and particularly have not examined the association with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA) gene which may be a key vitamin D pathway gene. We conducted a nested case-control study of 734 cases and 1435 individually matched controls from a population-based prospective cohort study, the Northern Sweden Mammary Screening Cohort. Tag and functional SNPs were genotyped for the VDR, cytochrome p450 24A1 (CYP24A1), and RXRA genes. We also genotyped specific SNPs in four other genes related to vitamin D metabolism and signaling (GC/VDBP, CYP2R1, DHCR7, and CYP27B1). SNPs in the CYP2R1, DHCR7, and VDBP gene regions that were associated with circulating 25(OH)D concentration in GWAS were also associated with plasma 25(OH)D in our study (p-trend <0.005). After taking into account the false discovery rate, these SNPs were not significantly associated with breast cancer risk, nor were any of the other SNPs or haplotypes in VDR, RXRA, and CYP24A1. We observed no statistically significant associations between polymorphisms or haplotypes in key vitamin D-related genes and risk of breast cancer. These results, combined with the observation in this cohort and most other prospective studies of no association of circulating 25(OH)D with breast cancer risk, do not support an association between vitamin D and breast cancer risk.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Tess V.

dc3892c8835e060d50cd508d6e784a574f0802ab,A peptide-retrieval strategy enables significant improvement of quantitative performance without compromising confidence of identification.,"Reliable quantification of low-abundance proteins in complex proteomes is challenging largely owing to the limited number of spectra/peptides identified. In this study we developed a straightforward method to improve the quantitative accuracy and precision of proteins by strategically retrieving the less confident peptides that were previously filtered out using the standard target-decoy search strategy. The filtered-out MS/MS spectra matched to confidently-identified proteins were recovered, and the peptide-spectrum-match FDR were re-calculated and controlled at a confident level of FDRâ‰¤1%, while protein FDR maintained at ~1%. We evaluated the performance of this strategy in both spectral count- and ion current-based methods. >60% increase of total quantified spectra/peptides was respectively achieved for analyzing a spike-in sample set and a public dataset from CPTAC. Incorporating the peptide retrieval strategy significantly improved the quantitative accuracy and precision, especially for low-abundance proteins (e.g. one-hit proteins). Moreover, the capacity of confidently discovering significantly-altered proteins was also enhanced substantially, as demonstrated with two spike-in datasets. In summary, improved quantitative performance was achieved by this peptide recovery strategy without compromising confidence of protein identification, which can be readily implemented in a broad range of quantitative proteomics techniques including label-free or labeling approaches.


SIGNIFICANCE
We hypothesize that more quantifiable spectra and peptides in a protein, even including less confident peptides, could help reduce variations and improve protein quantification. Hence the peptide retrieval strategy was developed and evaluated in two spike-in sample sets with different LC-MS/MS variations using both MS1- and MS2-based quantitative approach. The list of confidently identified proteins using the standard target-decoy search strategy was fixed and more spectra/peptides with less confidence matched to confident proteins were retrieved. However, the total peptide-spectrum-match false discovery rate (PSM FDR) after retrieval analysis was still controlled at a confident level of FDRâ‰¤1%. As expected, the penalty for occasionally incorporating incorrect peptide identifications is negligible by comparison with the improvements in quantitative performance. More quantifiable peptides, lower missing value rate, better quantitative accuracy and precision were significantly achieved for the same protein identifications by this simple strategy. This strategy is theoretically applicable for any quantitative approaches in proteomics and thereby provides more quantitative information, especially on low-abundance proteins.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chengjian Tu"", ids = ""5225459""); list(name = ""Shichen Shen"", ids = ""6456018""); list(name = ""Quanhu Sheng"", ids = ""143872309""); list(name = ""Yu Shyr"", ids = ""80280201""); list(name = ""Jun Qu"", ids = ""144876347"")",26fc554fc3aab6d486e76e7eb27c7606fb28b471,,Journal of proteomics,152,"

a67a2cc2f624276c0fd1119fbd6a0182335bb0e1,In-Culture Cross-Linking of Bacterial Cells Reveals Large-Scale Dynamic Proteinâ€“Protein Interactions at the Peptide Level,"Identification of dynamic protein-protein interactions at the peptide level on a proteomic scale is a challenging approach that is still in its infancy. We have developed a system to cross-link cells directly in culture with the special lysine cross-linker bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl-glutarate (BAMG). We used the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis as an exemplar system. Within 5 min extensive intracellular cross-linking was detected, while intracellular cross-linking in a Gram-negative species, Escherichia coli, was still undetectable after 30 min, in agreement with the low permeability in this organism for lipophilic compounds like BAMG. We were able to identify 82 unique interprotein cross-linked peptides with <1% false discovery rate by mass spectrometry and genome-wide database searching. Nearly 60% of the interprotein cross-links occur in assemblies involved in transcription and translation. Several of these interactions are new, and we identified a binding site between the Î´ and Î²' subunit of RNA polymerase close to the downstream DNA channel, providing a clue into how Î´ might regulate promoter selectivity and promote RNA polymerase recycling. Our methodology opens new avenues to investigate the functional dynamic organization of complex protein assemblies involved in bacterial growth.

0ad49399b5230c65fb352f179409e2b510175016,Visualizing and comparing results of different peptide identification methods,"In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, peptides are typically identified from tandem mass spectra using spectrum comparison. A sequence search engine compares experimentally obtained spectra with those predicted from protein sequences, applying enzyme cleavage and fragmentation rules. To this, there are two main alternatives: spectral libraries and de novo sequencing. The former compares measured spectra with a collection of previously acquired and identified spectra in a library. De novo attempts to sequence peptides from the tandem mass spectra alone. We here present a theoretical framework and a data processing workflow for visualizing and comparing the results of these different types of algorithms. The method considers the three search strategies as different dimensions, identifies distinct agreement classes and visualizes the complementarity of the search strategies. We have included X! Tandem, SpectraST and PepNovo, as they are in common use and representative for algorithms of each type. Our method allows advanced investigation of how the three search methods perform relatively to each other and shows the impact of the currently used decoy sequences for evaluating the false discovery rates.",2018,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yassene Mohammed"", ids = ""144077021""); list(name = ""Magnus Palmblad"", ids = ""145790141"")",cb5e1d9a76d2e9e0956bcffb351a191279577428,0f5751f76cef4a502b22ad088c381a4d0bb10121; 4e09cf2e449864c391918b538408355e53a7f17e; 233dd4127b57fae0a4da65e809d7816f87cc20cf; bd47b314eecce4fd08bd9f1fa068d1cb4e2db63d; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 1b03414ebace3aae831362dc3ab07619e1ecb36f; 87b443f1141878a823dd6ee3e01df67d88c6d6a8; 45d7345cf9b160fbe0169fc396ff0f60f4f8644a; 49a51e64e4ca3a86807eb362eee4809ce549e8dc; 297412c6b262d40a028a7b602ce6407b6e7d4253; 2521da99ac8e020d7c6821d7501d489b42720132; 100f4767f087e858976013b7117f38d26bb32a66; 57ac346d9cb8d7b7151428ec83b4f95e5df90829; 6cade22a0fe2fd35b243d3afa995c6891664cdb6; 07daee8d7a9dc6a3312594ff610d22885d12672f; e49adb3715fe044cb63e0ebab37dd78cec4f7d61; 10374f736a7d745f02cfbb56581a62913c38e874; 19fc13f1fa9f5df98090a675a1a0b21878125c7c; ddc98c4b96d7ad908f89cc60aa0bf3083484a0ab; cf4b5a0df74650820a590d9182097a32581620d3; 905121d8f65f72d861df7dc2be43c7ac8d05e239; 8d2b1c5581f8ff676654f7c5158503d3d8d2d498; 9eaa16786db3c9dc34c838c815577c8d8d29e2a4; e58ed3d9b4352ea955ce28ff6102e96c74d3ca5c; 0eb722041d65535a7801d1ef00605d6d838636b1; 9c5a02217f8923cab1e786416ba82e93e54a51b0; 36789799e464aa7465125ff8e778939843a0e89b,Briefings in Bioinformatics,19,210â€“218
b7900002f64126d79f0a1af5d1579bfb4e332b63,Transcriptome analysis reveals corresponding genes and key pathways involved in heat stress in Hu sheep,"Heat stress (HS) seriously affects animal performance. In view of global warming, it is essential to understand the regulatory mechanisms by which animals adapt to heat stress. In this study, our aim was to explore the genes and pathways involved in heat stress in sheep. To this end, we used transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular responses to heat stress and thereby identify means to protect sheep from heat shock. To obtain an overview of the effects of heat stress on sheep, we used the hypothalamus for transcriptome sequencing and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs; false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.01; fold change >â€‰2) during heat stress. A total of 1423 DEGs (1122 upregulated and 301 downregulated) were identified and classified into Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Heat stress triggered dramatic and complex alterations in gene expression in the hypothalamus. We hypothesized that heat stress induced apoptosis and dysfunction in cells and vital organs and affected growth, development, reproduction, and circadian entrainment via the calcium signaling pathway, which influences ribosome assembly and function. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the expression of the genes regulating important biological functions or whose expression profiles were significantly changed after acute heat stress (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01; fold change > 4), and the results showed that the expression patterns of these genes were consistent with the results of transcriptome sequencing, indicating that the credibility of the sequencing results. Our data indicated that heat stress induced calcium dyshomeostasis, blocked biogenesis, caused ROS accumulation, impaired the antioxidant system and innate defense, and induced apoptosis through the P53 signaling pathway activated by PEG3, decreased growth and development, and enhanced organ damage. These data is very important and helpful to elucidate the molecular mechanism of heat stress and finally to find ways to deal with heat stress damage in sheep.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yx Li"", ids = ""80472688""); list(name = ""XP Feng"", ids = ""152501519""); list(name = ""H-L Wang"", ids = ""120241459""); list(name = ""CH Meng"", ids = ""152248796""); list(name = ""Jiefu Zhang"", ids = ""6499634""); list(name = ""Yang Qian"", ids = ""152151972""); list(name = ""JF Zhong"", ids = ""152113637""); list(name = ""SX Cao"", ids = ""152205989"")",,13ceda93a3f46544d59fad1c22c6e07c03bf515a; 37a16178914dd533445bb0c238c02bf861e03ea1; 0480b5a74c1f7a02f585efde397c67015e3c2ce6; 54423bf0b8650f51e9a92520ed7a24414508a226; fa588ee7960f3f3fbfd6ef2ae88de86751808f68; c0b112bc14f77c4462fd52c6ea91b31bb431c8ee; 471c7dc35787ff4d210497fbb60923776127aa57; 30cab700dc80c9fab1dbbf8beed8f6b35da07854; a613bfe3675fe8bbc7392fd259682a7326cd68c5; 0304ec64a17901e93744fe64463e0019da6629b8; c46c52b693531a4f5dc4defb02d376b2e9f58ef9; 785213b64050dca9ffe91f48da1e76d29ad97097; 89ed0ab868c54dc9fab9e2c64437d8e2f81ada3e; cb4af8311a670c546bf0d1d086ed69a28224cb16; a417fb875f03c4e4a360c065038f966264e72b54; ed759e9fa658e0905902e6f7d2abd414faececce; 8949943e7f2beb91c7d72da765bd957d02e876e0; 1ef724bf564844da2dba1f7e3d9d9cc44e3ad82b; 2c4879cfad4993fc18e28511cae2998e75c9e72e; 3f4d9f2b669fa123bb54105399396c6fff1019f2; ce0c3683ace7f3011c4e43e7b023e02dfde52c05; a4ca34c5ed681d5debfcb10936e6ba88f44a8540; f26259e5221cc96758919452294e73b28b33e49d; 81d22d27914833edceff16d6e146e8ddca294f7a; 036903672d4d35d248e3dd4110544b73e5e89680; 98898dc35040d154ada506f5dae4f8b6c5e3da53; 49e84a0e09d9150372eeb2dea04066394465f8be; 5b67b001b9681db7668598276b551ccd85a75688; c1343a697f7fcebef69829b00510b99d12be5124; a43c8653de878a29662e5b238fec5c8a39ae8dde; 2861ec358514ff4ac622e3e7a23549357424c747; fa9b4bfbf95d8f83fe4f56459cd82ab53d51abd7; 81a3d53a74c09eee336194477823080e3d38b589; d719ed9fcc4002b63494d054ec2b912263641d44; b8c1d6a60e50add80b12dd0907aadc6097d13fc3; dee0e1b6fe7f483a14636094b514fc5fa40ddccb; 4f350c4b115f8c9327c82343420658c30bd4fcb5; 306f96737afc324d0d2a55d63f2decbf749144f1; 7be3e489a6bbf96f9f5c77aa79aeccd3b8c1dc3d; 4a2a9cafc51f9e14553c4729d3aff067f02b4b23; 3a8284d27f88dfbfbd7a6be42094d0be3f9dabfe; 80ac808a959a0ac9457c79fbe6bb4c8eb1424efc; 9b819e76ade9464f95e9cb56f32d2aa142972ff7; bf29b38eecb984bc280a311418f9ae09e99ec9ad; 224eb9d775c21497e0bb67e5c817424835b05959; 790778b12c1b056598a230d4955daac9fdf95eb1; 5acdd781dd8b25137b77b2bc13b09f91e77a7cce; 10019a89979a9aec0b79947348678ff79a2f0e25; c6eca4f99d47be0f2f8ed1d4ae00a8999cd5ccf8; 29e2dfc0c13e39a300aef869f819c13f04fb306e; 4dd5845aca177809f48a36ab562823d54416dee3; 87c4688b8f1808f3786e9a55d9ea45d0eaa753b8; 545074b7e4732bc27fabb9f02b41786d3468d382,Cell Stress and Chaperones,24,1045 - 1054

In this paper, we present a Markov random field model for the joint analysis of multiple ChIP-seq experiments. The proposed model naturally accounts for spatial dependencies in the data, by assuming first order Markov properties, and for the large proportion of zero counts, by using zero-inflated mixture distributions. In contrast to all other available implementations, the model allows for the joint modelling of multiple experiments, by incorporating key aspects of the experimental design. In particular, the model uses the information about replicates and about the different antibodies used in the experiments. An extensive simulation study shows a lower false non-discovery rate for the proposed method, compared to existing methods, at the same false discovery rate. Finally, we present an analysis on real data for the detection of histone modifications of two chromatin modifiers from eight ChIP-seq experiments, including technical replicates with different IP efficiencies.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yanchun Bao"", ids = ""1408875472""); list(name = ""Veronica Vinciotti"", ids = ""3173242""); list(name = ""Ernst Wit"", ids = ""145328439""); list(name = ""Peter Bram 'T Hoen"", ids = ""153449920"")",d0760dbb0780b35be95691579c650f16b1c30b98; 69fc0cb321e54db8da7701d5cd8aa18c14ed8ce2; eb4437ebab4cef47ea6b4b8f712d616ceabe8c09,,arXiv: Methodology,,

Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has been inconsistently associated with asthma and allergic diseases and increased number of infections in early childhood. We examined the association of PFASs measured in pregnancy with childhood asthma, allergies and common infectious diseases in a prospective pregnancy cohort followed to age 7â€¯years.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Six PFASs (out of 19 measured) with at least 80% of measurements above the limit of quantification (LOQ) in maternal plasma during pregnancy in two subcohorts of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) were analyzed in relation to health outcomes: perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), and perfluoroheptane sulfonic acid (PFHpS). Follow-up questionnaires were completed at 3â€¯years by 1270 women and at 7â€¯years by 972 women among the 1943 with pregnancy questionnaire and PFAS measures. Health outcomes included parent reports of child's symptoms or doctor diagnosed asthma and allergic conditions at age 7â€¯years and parent-reported frequency of various infections at 3 and 7â€¯years of age. Logistic and Poisson regression were used. The false discovery rate was controlled at 5%. Sensitivity analyses on gender were performed.


RESULTS
Among the allergy and asthma outcomes, a statistically significant inverse association was seen between PFUnDA concentrations and ever having atopic eczema in girls. PFUnDA also tended to be inversely associated with both wheeze and asthma. For infections from 0 to 3 and 6 to 7â€¯years, 11 significant positive associations were seen between PFASs and airways infections (bronchitis/pneumonia, throat infection, pseudocroup), ear infection and gastric flu/diarrhea; whereas 6 inverse associations were seen for pseudocroup, ear infections and urinary tract infections. The majority of the findings with respect to infectious diseases were found in girls only.


DISCUSSION
With the exception of an inverse association between PFUnDA and eczema, and a tendency of a similar association for wheeze and asthma, maternal PFAS levels during pregnancy showed little association with asthma or allergy related outcomes. Findings from the present study suggest immunosuppressive effects of PFASs on airways infections, such as bronchitis/pneumonia and throat infections, as well as diarrhea/gastric flu. Our results indicate a possible role of gender in the PFAS-health outcome associations.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Antti Impinen"", ids = ""49699287""); list(name = ""Matthew P.

f745024479b8a541fbb81a089acbca64bd8a2a51,Experimental design and data analysis of Agoâ€RIPâ€Seq experiments for the identification of microRNA targets,"&NA; The identification of microRNA (miRNA) target genes is crucial for understanding miRNA function. Many methods for the genomeâ€wide miRNA target identification have been developed in recent years; however, they have several limitations including the dependence on lowâ€confident prediction programs and artificial miRNA manipulations. Agoâ€RNA immunoprecipitation combined with highâ€throughput sequencing (Agoâ€RIPâ€Seq) is a promising alternative. However, appropriate statistical data analysis algorithms taking into account the experimental design and the inherent noise of such experiments are largely lacking. Here, we investigate the experimental design for Agoâ€RIPâ€Seq and examine biostatistical methods to identify de novo miRNA target genes. Statistical approaches considered are either based on a negative binomial model fit to the read count data or applied to transformed data using a normal distributionâ€based generalized linear model. We compare them by a real data simulation study using plasmode data sets and evaluate the suitability of the approaches to detect true miRNA targets by sensitivity and false discovery rates. Our results suggest that simple approaches like linear regression models on (appropriately) transformed read count data are preferable.",2018,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Diana Tichy"", ids = ""7948727""); list(name = ""Julia Maria Anna Pickl"", ids = ""15295434""); list(name = ""Axel Benner"", ids = ""2836909""); list(name = ""Holger Sueltmann"", ids = ""143959696"")",c87de08fc16e67cda42c438226a1d206f01de9e6,f029c616e184e2a6eaa670d38069eb89462295bc; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 04d103d886af91e28ba10ba3dac5924690cd997c; e70ba61fab6dfbc4506fc86ed19698cfd9db9384; b03d12808d98d83c9b9a06c44928852253ca65e3; 161eabcbda99ae007133b2312c10881afecd247b; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; eba1c11f998f1103396db952be248938ca5acf6e; 18bcac32591724c0620d3f98fb3d297987705f86; 571c3ea8cabd16ab0ae7a1a3495d3f3aca918e23; e0d5fb21a599b73c56cb9fc1f3cdd8fbcc4640d9; 319db37a590eddf69308f68a8ea7f8b155c66a19; a992c8fd24587f12d41f48df84b29d847634c0e4; de35a83c0cee2a9cdd5311013b3b704d2967abba; 78ce0c149860363bbbe34306c75a4454ad23828d; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7; da19a2206d31d2858a239303aa4f22e40a69d65f; 6ba13c951fdc3cc472a8ceeba02142299236f1f4; 378a01ae785c7aee9b975223fc401c8457f8b366; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68; 5298242a0b8013ab1e379bc69687895aeaf60222; 53aebbe0ab000bee79bd58f5eb47a2ea447de2cf; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; 4e15a268586023e6e6ba6a49eedd4a33e98d531d,Briefings in Bioinformatics,19,918â€“929

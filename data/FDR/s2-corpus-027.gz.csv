6404294be6ba2862c1cc9ab737385f3a091f8503,Genome-wide scale analyses identify novel BMI genotype-environment interactions using a conditional false discovery rate,"Genotype-environment interaction (GÃ—E) studies typically focus on variants with previously known marginal associations. While such two-step filtering greatly reduces the multiple testing burden, it can miss loci with pronounced GÃ—E effects, which tend to have weaker marginal associations. To test for GÃ—E effects on a genome-wide scale whilst leveraging information from marginal associations in a flexible manner, we combine the conditional false discovery rate with interaction test results obtained from StructLMM. After validating our approach, we applied this strategy to UK Biobank (UKBB) data to probe for GÃ—E effects on BMI. Using 126,077 UKBB individuals for discovery, we identified known (FTO, MC4R, SEC16B) and novel GÃ—E signals, many of which replicated (FAM150B/ALKAL2,TMEM18, EFR3B, ZNF596-FAM87A, LIN7C-BDNF, FAIM2, UNC79, LAT) in an independent subset of UKBB (n=126,076). Finally, when analysing the full UKBB cohort, we identified 140 candidate loci with GÃ—E effects, highlighting the advantages of our approach.",2020,Biology,"list(name = ""Rachel J.

d21f709c20ae7f65e732422a6280b8c707ff2606,Soy glyceollins regulate transcript abundance in the female mouse brain,"Glyceollins (Glys), produced by soy plants in response to stress, have anti-estrogenic activity in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. In addition to known anti-estrogenic effects, Gly exhibits mechanisms of action not involving estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. To date, effects of Gly on gene expression in the brain are unknown. For this study, we implanted 17-Î² estradiol (E2) or placebo slow-release pellets into ovariectomized CFW mice followed by 11Â days of exposure to Gly or vehicle i.p. injections. We then performed a microarray on total RNA extracted from whole-brain hemispheres and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by a 2â€‰Ã—â€‰2 factorial ANOVA with an false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰=â€‰0.20. In total, we identified 33 DEGs with a significant E2 main effect, 5 DEGs with a significant Gly main effect, 74 DEGs with significant Gly and E2 main effects (but no significant interaction term), and 167 DEGs with significant interaction terms. Clustering across all DEGs revealed that transcript abundances were similar between the E2â€‰+â€‰Gly and E2-only treatments. However, gene expression after Gly-only treatment was distinct from both of these treatments and was generally characterized by higher transcript abundance. Collectively, our results suggest that whether Gly acts in the brain through ER-dependent or ER-independent mechanisms depends on the target gene.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sanaya F.

ae557bddc1164cc440f56a012d7ecc26353d09d7,Early Prediction of Moderate-Severe Chronic GvHD By Immunity Related Transcriptome,"Introduction:Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is the most common and debilitating complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Among the two clinically significant forms, moderate-severe chronic GvHD (cGvHD) is more difficult to treat than grade 2-4 acute GvHD (aGvHD). Chronic GvHD rarely shows a sustained complete response to immunosuppressive drugs and non-responders either die or suffer long-term. However, if an early and accurate prediction of ensuing cGvHD is posiible, then the high risk patients can be identified and treated preemptively. In the present investigation, we retrospectively analyzed the transcriptome of immunity related genes at one month post-transplant with the aim to identify a potential early and accurate predictor of clinically significant cGvHD. Methods:A cohort of 73 HLA matched first allogeneic HCT recipients with moderate-severe cGvHD (n = 31) and no chronic GvHD (n = 42) were included in the study. All patients received similar myeloablative conditioning regimens along with 4.5 mg/kg antithymocyte globulin as GvHD prophylaxis. The diagnosis of cGvHD was based on National Institutes of Health consensus criteria and median day of diagnosis in our cohort was 126 days. Total RNA was extracted from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) at one month post-transplant. Gene expression CodeSet profiling of 594 immunity related genes including 15 internal reference genes was performed using Nano string Technology Immunology panel. Differential gene expression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses was performed using R statistical packages and GraphPad PRISM software. Benjamini Hochberg procedure was used to calculate the P value and the false discovery rate (FDR). Differentially expressed genes with a Benjamini Hochberg P value (BHP) of Results:A gene panel consisting of immunity related 12 genes was identified at one month post-transplant whose transcriptome profile was significantly different between patients that developed moderate-severe cGvHD compared to the patients who did not develop cGvHD. The identified gene panel included highly upregulated T cell activation and proliferation markers like CD3D (BHP=0.005), CD3E (BHP=0.01), CCR7 (BHP=0.005), CD5 (BHP=0.006); TNF receptor superfamily markers like B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator-BTLA (BHP=0.004), CD27 (BHP=0.004), CD40LG (BHP=0.005); and Costimulatory signaling molecules like Inducible T-cell Co-stimulator ICOS (BHP=0.001), CD28 (BHP=0.006) in patients with cGVHD. A gene score of >7 in this panel of 12 genes was able to differentiate patients with high risk of developing mod-severe cGvHD with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 88% (AUC = 0.88, P Conclusions:The cGvHD gene panel consisting of 12 genes from multiple immune regulatory pathways identified in the present study provided an early prediction of moderate-severe cGvHD (one month) with high sensitivity and specificity. The robust and rapid technique of nanostring based transcriptome profiling has the potential to be implemented in the clinic. Differentiating patients at high risk of mod-severe cGvHD can help develop new strategies for preemptive therapy and pave the way towards precision medicine leading to improved outcomes of HCT.

It is assumed to produce random score distributions, which are not affected by biological differences between samples. We argue that this assumption is questionable and show that basic requirements for null distributions are not met. 
 
We propose a novel approach to the significance analysis of microarray data, called permutation filtering.

The association of aspirin use and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) risk is unclear. This study determined whether use of any individual compound is associated with ALS risk by conducting a total population-based case-control study in Taiwan.


METHODS
A total of 729 patients with newly diagnosed ALS who had a severely disabling disease certificate between January 1, 2002, and December 1, 2008, comprised the case group. These cases were compared with 7290 sex-, age-, residence-, and insurance premium-matched controls. Drug use by each Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code was analyzed using conditional logistic regression models. False discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P values were reported in order to avoid inflating false positives.


RESULTS
Of the 1336 compounds, only the 266 with use cases exceeding 30 in our database were included in the screening analysis. Without controlling for steroid use, the analysis failed to reveal any compound that was inversely associated with ALS risk according to FDR criteria. After controlling for steroid use, we found use of the following compounds to be associated with ALS risk: aspirin, diphenhydramine (one of the antihistamines), and mefenamic acid (one of the NSAIDs). A multivariate analysis revealed that aspirin was independently inversely associated with ALS risk after controlling for diphenhydramine, mefenamic acid, and steroid use. The inverse association between aspirin and ALS was present predominately in patients older than 55 years.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study suggested that aspirin use might reduce the risk of ALS, and the benefit might be more prominent for older people.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ching-Piao Tsai"", ids = ""35160329""); list(name = ""Feng-Cheng Lin"", ids = ""122208219""); list(name = ""Johnny Kuang-Wu Lee"", ids = ""32772317""); list(name = ""Charles Tzu-Chi Lee"", ids = ""36936413"")",a1dd85c4eec78a6563c18b388e1a73518be9d922; b5e100a47b590d069ff86f5abb211373d3c287f1; b9cc59eeb3727206bae84f5bde01352d7d5a96f2; 891c11797eb32977fb536a8991a171f3a6ae0747; 115dc7600b1e13760e2623d6ad0aa11c03436a50,ff37296744b9b270cb18762fd3ea755e1901cb6a; d2dfc339dd20de34479a79f8dfd2131f470d5462; 9215e5bd7fab4b16e41c1f2a760d846ff358ddba; cc3b2d722b50e786578ff20ed8ae7b9777bb96e6; dd47fe94dcb4d8d416b70a1f1c3d614d3b4c91f8; 1b0c210d33ed778a844e814d1250568995f5e3a8; 499778bfb842380bfc79d34fbd1adcdf6fc5f6ac; c620b0274d65a168466325e174b0aaccf302f4c9; 81a3e715a49204de0aa56c90449841e2aed62666; ff410dc9c214d07d9a88a9279fa32a443f719ba5; f967e1fa5f2605b926a071c4046c01747035db77; 3609c8a19042afa51e89e79ab76772ed4734249c; 3453b9dd4eaba5ba6d4c62eeb0beaea53c16ae60; 67d5c928bb4eced66f6ac7cf440e0ca32322258d; ae82164d504897184e3f2a6852bc2a34a6f0e1c5; e84689afa372b0219b095c6a3a8f817e51d8823e; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; ac1b336821d7a6165f30d50f15baa97c8144b1a5; fece59d1bacf3c96bd3b7df4b9a1eee2e94f5b18; 2122fa62549b5341ae6eb806e89ec8ad375093e3; 681518eb292b81f1db3fe3939bcc608fe616df30; 8eeca0f138fc5155812f2970d1565e6b971cb59c; 81a383461d8a5cb33f6e2affa9aaf87cbe757df6; 9ebfc36da4000545484b9b6f348ffb05f547bad5; a9380b65199e51524ec0a47a6cb86e59025f2279; 7b7a157a783c5bc4cf9fdd570317a3b184f23b94; c907ba306b359baea4525d7a76123b69c2552aa0; f4618c196be9947105e9ad12017fd3245a5301bc; 139c6b75d50506db779748e295519533a61ce9e1; e1af97c60b6f27b09edf9806d630c26d53d42ca3,Journal of Epidemiology,25,172 - 177
77fda8193d96f8b1b507333367aaeb97b564002b,"Identification of transcriptome-wide, nut weight-associated SNPs in Castanea crenata","Nut weight is one of the most important traits that can affect a chestnut growerâ€™s returns. Due to the long juvenile phase of chestnut trees, the selection of desired characteristics at early developmental stages represents a major challenge for chestnut breeding. In this study, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcriptomic regions, which were significantly associated with nut weight in chestnuts (Castanea crenata), using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data were generated from large and small nut-bearing trees, using an Illumina HiSeq. 2000 system, and 3,271,142 SNPs were identified. A total of 21 putative SNPs were significantly associated with chestnut weight (false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰<â€‰10âˆ’5), based on further analyses. We also applied five machine learning (ML) algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), C5.0, k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), partial least squares (PLS), and random forest (RF), using the 21 SNPs to predict the nut weights of a second population. The average accuracy of the ML algorithms for the prediction of chestnut weights was greater than 68%. Taken together, we suggest that these SNPs have the potential to be used during marker-assisted selection to facilitate the breeding of large chestnut-bearing varieties.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Minjeong Kang"", ids = ""120434417""); list(name = ""Ah-Young Shin"", ids = ""133665387""); list(name = ""Younhee Shin"", ids = ""40374679""); list(name = ""Sanga Lee"", ids = ""93738030""); list(name = ""Hyo-Ryeon Lee"", ids = ""5248600""); list(name = ""Tae-Dong Kim"", ids = ""92195654""); list(name = ""Mina Choi"", ids = ""47191174""); list(name = ""Namjin Koo"", ids = ""7517115""); list(name = ""Y Kim"", ids = ""50681917""); list(name = ""Dongsoo Kyeong"", ids = ""81459682""); list(name = ""Sathiyamoorthy Subramaniyam"", ids = ""67227830""); list(name = ""Eung-Jun Park"", ids = ""2824018"")",,c29bd4ebc1dda2315edf21ff39c6891d083899d5; 7c3cb1231b5f81d7fadd79bc18cbf217da3ad5c2; dde8cc53567eb6774cbab751a875faed51751884; 0ae262d9cf78536754bc064e07113ab5e978f208; be888c47c71f2e05520a17a84bebe46e52699cd5; 27cae979e8990d3e7d84ee3ec888205b6beda5e4; 8e43b65e5a00ba12e60f87d7227e46b29cdb200a; 00759f6546825e5e5b3029f3bce6dac5193b7c1d; f08b3b405f1a9ce31cc51ba79178caf92ebadd93; 2a9e9d06b4563be3518009ecb4b941080a2bad30; b6c58b8f4617d5c4ce1f336083e1543fd04858ed; 0a677a27b6ce720358f569787a0af3d4f8d2c953; 1e9335e5e22e88c8679adf97c3487872f75143cb; b44f973e2652e4450ce4b50f3e4912e33189a08d; f29fee43079a3d8eb68e5574c79acd5b04b9b055; e01b5d5e4b153f660d1241c7add9535478da1701; 7fdbd1a2ed4cc84cb20f46848d24e33752b6a85b; 92c15c860c4fd1248d720d676cbb04e6fb3fc718; 772c3f272882c75b6ec847b9502b625501ba3866; 2d9af5dd68b54385c2da691ce46c159474888185; eac6149293e2e8d2d90b7ee9231aad24c86ca709; 0b259ff3619c14a43ef1fc52937dcd417b52b493; 456c5473e98f412c7de6d7d911582d6e50933613; 862e221fee50be92743e8f4a4bc03b4d35162b3e; baed573c22c29cc2be11312970428379430f9b6b; 6fca260e9a3c37e246cc15e7639d1a5fa2aed465; 1417d76cd23732bd5c1ce471897237320e72e9f1; 26c764c3b1fb3d9bef4eddb45cf7914d12a19a4f; dc73c9fed49ad6ac9ace60f7523825fa1c595c07; 70de542b0b2165cdb40390e9ffc126c0a015919c; 11624d6ebc70a57cacb18224aff788d835b8e74f; c7c21838553e5ccd1011173b4088c32672d0df23; 3c70cc22422d8f8a9c596be968b007899107dea9; 21898b43e892a6002c104b2f4ecdf32b4a1878f0; 9d7f58acc89bdbc180468eb5ce61bb47cd56379a; 22bc30dade7f964942162be34ea2ac12d3d68397; e55407e0974c17c668a683c2b707a5eba09b0a98; cc90910b6e31fe44cddc1e341f21eec0aaa5db44; 1df4e1fad3e3a1b4236fb8585cdc94ff12c242fb; 39a4d8422a1e142a0b96d73536c3caf3aceb170b; 5eff66fd99c1f80cb1d5b8af709e8b32852508ab; faa44556c23910004e64d06084f9d92cf659d1e8; e2a4e5984ef402b7599cd75ffcba530c4f0c1630; b6e2c5cbd7043eb5128ae373d04ce92afb49f325; 669f48aab6f6cf32432c1840965ad44bdc5dc109; f687c7679ea9da908f45b0c34f7d1d69ecceba57; 38d1ed1430073c8491873953f397a9fd50c02845; 732f5c8ea2d5660945350d4e7a7d3298d3c6c92e; cd4653dd757446de7edb20cb7eb191699c1d767b; c29cc4433f94345995af8be098f9ee4921a1f36f; 3482a2c72a6d03deb8ce8f630558d745582dc116; a1842f621ec9cbef5b696a4de8c2ece4f4733c8b; 156c8e5d8ea7f80a87902279373b21cda074f746; a485dd5ea67699c5871dd87239e19f70d456c762; 4b0ef84cad2af793db2d04b636a5cedccdcdec7c; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 561f43ee178bade44afc84141d57501a0e6feeb2; 2ee27eff8ac0cfcf48b28dcbbfa769ec5af7f316; 9c4fb83f9c95c677ca5fa7e478de438b733a002d; 5f5287124b015757f63ace297a772f7ef89cdf1c; 524613c40ac411ed5a7d57190181dee3838e0869; 404fb04f0e0bf1f5a01689ae1cef13c6845fcf67,Scientific Reports,9,

23ba7f6c682be4e005ad385ba65a00d8535cf19d,Analysis of the Escherichia coli extracellular vesicle proteome identifies markers of purity and culture conditions,"ABSTRACT Bacteria release nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the extracellular milieu. Bacterial EVs contain molecular cargo originating from the parent bacterium and have important roles in bacterial survival and pathogenesis. Using 8-plex iTRAQ approaches, we profiled the EV proteome of two Escherichia coli strains, uropathogenic (UPEC) 536 and probiotic Nissle 1917. For these strains, we compared the proteome of crude input EVs prepared by ultracentrifugation alone with EVs purified by either density gradient centrifugation (DGC) or size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We further compared the proteome of EVs from bacterial cultures that were grown in iron-restricted (R) and iron-supplemented (RF) conditions. Overall, outer membrane components were highly enriched, and bacterial inner membrane components were significantly depleted in both UPEC and Nissle EVs, in keeping with an outer membrane origin. In addition, we found enrichment of ribosome-related Gene Ontology terms in UPEC EVs and proteins involved in glycolytic processes and ligase activity in Nissle EVs. We have identified that three proteins (RbsB of UPEC in R; YoeA of UPEC in RF; BamA of Nissle in R) were consistently enriched in the DGC- and SEC-purified EV samples in comparison to their crude input EV, whereas conversely the 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL was enriched in the crude input EVs for both UPEC and Nissle in R condition. Such proteins may have utility as technical markers for assessing the purity of E. coli EV preparations. Several proteins were changed in their abundance depending on the iron availability in the media. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011345. In summary, we have undertaken a comprehensive characterization of the protein content of E. coli EVs and found evidence of specific EV cargos for physiological activity and conserved protein cargo that may find utility as markers in the future.

After a run-in phase, 10 generally healthy Belgian or Dutch women received soymilk for 5 days. MethylCap-seq methylation profiles were compared with those of 10 matched controls. Isoflavones and their microbial metabolites were quantified in urine, serum, and glandular breast tissue (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) and 17Î²-estradiol in glandular breast tissue (immunoassay). Global DNA methylation levels were obtained for 6 cases and 5 controls using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Although lower MethylCap-seq coverages were observed, mass spectrometry results and computational LINE-1 methylation analysis did not provide evidence supporting global methylation alterations upon treatment. At a false discovery rate of 0.05, no differentially methylated loci were identified. Moreover, a set of previously identified loci was specifically tested, but earlier reported results could not be validated. In conclusion, after a 5-day soymilk treatment, no major general epigenetic reprogramming in breast tissue could be found in this exploratory study.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Louis Coussement"", ids = ""1398841993""); list(name = ""Selin Bolca"", ids = ""5756166""); list(name = ""Wim van Criekinge"", ids = ""114653433""); list(name = ""Geert Trooskens"", ids = ""114405412""); list(name = ""Klaas Mensaert"", ids = ""3830077""); list(name = ""Katrien Poels"", ids = ""152949196""); list(name = ""Nathalie A.

Employing FDR methods in event-related potential (ERP) research provides an approach to explore new ERP paradigms and ERP-psychological trait/behavior relations. In Study 1, we examined neural responses to escape behavior from an aversive noise. In Study 2, we correlated a relatively unexplored trait dimension, ostracism, with neural response. In both situations we focused on the frontal cortical region, applying a channel by time plots to display statistically significant uncorrected data and FDR corrected data, controlling for multiple comparisons.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael J.

62cb134f2e82270a9f6bac6aa8081b0b46fa72b0,Effect of Cross-Validation on the Output of Multiple Testing Procedures,"High dimensional data with sparsity is routinely observed in many scientific disciplines. Filtering out the signals embedded in noise is a canonical problem in such situations requiring multiple testing. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure (BH) using False Discovery Rate control is the gold standard in large scale multiple testing. In Majumder et al. (2009) an internally cross-validated form of the procedure is used to avoid a costly replicate study and the complications that arise from population selection in such studies (i.e. extraneous variables). I implement this procedure and run extensive simulation studies under increasing levels of dependence among parameters and different data generating distributions and compare results with other common techniques. I illustrate that the internally cross-validated Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure results in a significantly reduced false discovery rate, while maintaining a reasonable, though increased, false negative rate, and in a reduction to inherent variability under strong dependence structures when compared with the usual Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure. In the discussion section, I describe some possibilities for relevant applications and future studies. Acknowledgements I must begin by thanking my thesis advisor Dr. Datta. Throughout the entire writing process he has been readily available and incredibly helpful. Whenever I would get stuck he always had a suggestion. Whenever I had questions he would have an explanation and references for further reading. Most of all, he was patient for which I am very thankful. I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Tipton and Dr. Zhang. Both professors have provided thoughtful and critical feedback, as well as encouragement throughout writing process. Their insights into improving the quality of my writing and probing questions challenged me to become a better student and Statistician. I am also thankful for my former coworkers at ASU-Beebe who encouraged me to return to college. The work we did compiling survey data during the grant writing process is part of the reason I decided to pursue this degree. I must also thank my family and friends. You all put up with me throughout my college career, and youâ€™ve all encouraged me along the way. Pursuing a graduate degree is a lot of work, but itâ€™s those people outside of school that are needed to keep students like myself grounded and sane. Thank you all for that.

c57e90064decdcc65301fab899eb48934aeb4256,Sequence-based identification of 3D structural modules in RNA with RMDetect,"Structural RNA modules, sets of ordered non-Watson-Crick base pairs embedded between Watson-Crick pairs, have central roles as architectural organizers and sites of ligand binding in RNA molecules, and are recurrently observed in RNA families throughout the phylogeny. Here we describe a computational tool, RNA three-dimensional (3D) modules detection, or RMDetect, for identifying known 3D structural modules in single and multiple RNA sequences in the absence of any other information. Currently, four modules can be searched for: G-bulge loop, kink-turn, C-loop and tandem-GA loop. In control test sequences we found all of the known modules with a false discovery rate of 0.23. Scanning through 1,444 publicly available alignments, we identified 21 yet unreported modules and 141 known modules.

ef28772cba472d81e8671f80f4c4878e23ab51b7,Genetic association study of circadian genes with seasonal pattern in bipolar disorders,"About one fourth of patients with bipolar disorders (BD) have depressive episodes with a seasonal pattern (SP) coupled to a more severe disease. However, the underlying genetic influence on a SP in BD remains to be identified. We studied 269 BD Caucasian patients, with and without SP, recruited from university-affiliated psychiatric departments in France and performed a genetic single-marker analysis followed by a gene-based analysis on 349 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 21 circadian genes and 3 melatonin pathway genes. A SP in BD was nominally associated with 14 SNPs identified in 6 circadian genes: NPAS2, CRY2, ARNTL, ARNTL2, RORA and RORB. After correcting for multiple testing, using a false discovery rate approach, the associations remained significant for 5 SNPs in NPAS2 (chromosome 2:100793045-100989719): rs6738097 (pcâ€‰=â€‰0.006), rs12622050 (pcâ€‰=â€‰0.006), rs2305159 (pcâ€‰=â€‰0.01), rs1542179 (pcâ€‰=â€‰0.01), and rs1562313 (pcâ€‰=â€‰0.02). The gene-based analysis of the 349 SNPs showed that rs6738097 (NPAS2) and rs1554338 (CRY2) were significantly associated with the SP phenotype (respective Empirical p-values of 0.0003 and 0.005). The associations remained significant for rs6738097 (NPAS2) after Bonferroni correction. The epistasis analysis between rs6738097 (NPAS2) and rs1554338 (CRY2) suggested an additive effect. Genetic variations in NPAS2 might be a biomarker for a seasonal pattern in BD.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Pierre Alexis Geoffroy"", ids = ""3401642""); list(name = ""Mohamed Lajnef"", ids = ""2063586""); list(name = ""Frank Bellivier"", ids = ""2848949""); list(name = ""SteÌ\201phane Jamain"", ids = ""5306710""); list(name = ""SÃ©bastien Gard"", ids = ""47041406""); list(name = ""Jean-Pierre Kahn"", ids = ""119150962""); list(name = ""Chantal Henry"", ids = ""77895811""); list(name = ""Marion Leboyer"", ids = ""3130925""); list(name = ""Bruno Ã‰tain"", ids = ""4062231"")",8b7004c3280fd0df70a6ca9a924e87880c7ee518; 20fb64ee0b572c416f9a54d6905908e3c3da457a; 8dde27070a1bdf31de12f124e33097a7672e062c; 7992d64ac4e61677b899a93f765c5014a8a9ee07; 82756853e57a986a23725b478a82941d773d6688; 9bd4ad9df8aafc2e266801c38291486c0bc9bb47; 711563f74c352fb85405656cbe5633fece7f8726; 263443dca926a278b11aedf338264cb333e2a560; 1e830eb9037d334af677c22d96cf0230236ca00c; 5d971b35bcc192313167bb6f10cdf11eb9164245; f55df5f515acc20cec79a918024c086aa0e621a3; d0eea91fa49343adf0958a6b3402c26fe2365ce6; ab2dd889506af4b577668c64251833f39406f132; 000b99aa296000a4faaebca63f49c0b8c99d0cb7; efee66e27999a53a711bdfd89b8a0d8cc8775f50; cf38f28beaa21d17acd761968af6c441e5c7a149; b61f0533221284529a6e550ce8981620cffb9996; 1482fff18dbf62186471fc3bbd0ad4afe9441b39; 726be4d438f96f836f88c368f96afc087aa62dcb; ed769b8e18958cc0a7d21496bd0a0399a82958fe; c3bd35121b8794db8241e981b206258b91ede6cd; e7a01d41d757da007a09b97a99651b57d50a63f3; 5f1da57c45ffdf22d6b193f9b361b48c580032a0,ed04abcbba934ad16eaa665446c0069c6fc85036; 16a5b755e645b6ed6dd5fb4730ff27754bc1fff0; 735d0d8b65d18e4da2bd6621bdd8fce57283fffa; 4f5126cd71221b81c0f474d2cc00301b7a8a9a95; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; cd3049cf48df52817be612c3b37143e231dde077; aceabca67b6bbd2cae28a23aaf89c7a4ae00c2ad; f92dbb150997eec738fa3ebb2d230e928568e1ab; 3c0df0d427526976d11072f14ffda3e6b3d9f971; ee7c91f7e8dd0f6b20408ddbe388eab98a3a53de; b27c240b40d52354ecc43f0bd4c062d3555f5c2a; 7da7fa4338fc82bbfb07dc6cbc69743c1c807662; f7761d3376749d66fb5eec1bcdfbcc8541548b5e; 35c5f960f16c220f403ca0ca0ebfbc84405a31bb; ea6478b93d135fdfb957b53e5f06ad6e36706617; 6bbe59bb7c9de8e2e8195b3ae26a3a1837cfc2aa; dad061f35a7fe0878597a6fd49e870e811bcf728; d62c064c2b38352af7ba1db950f73044c3a52126; 3a14152f47cbfd38db21a3d7e6b1b8cf0a887358; 08586440a28b1542280f64184b38a21e53b9bac3; 08e50d1cc59a1d9c1a0d21dfe9667e243aa1094d; 89c4e1eb8a1570d2ed33a2799d198e08ef20a616; 28d2d4c3f4a34b8dc22da621fffb980faa9c04a2; 89ec517c2abd1f56c5879b5357773c0b72fceb55; 1decd72363946c7d0b247c51375a5fb58852844a; 7fe1a73dde9014c1f8732db8f21de22c3a40e390; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; 5a6fd7b6a2c9561a12854694efe6af39a9cb38c4; 615f950ba8dcfbac1a7de0ddb9f21d20f05a7dea; 525b5edacc04dd2810113f21a71c68b899888362; c4a988808e9aa545e68008417d114ef737efb78d; 128c0465f873206c3333846ae996e99b7a7fe26c; ae572b0f58cfdff30fee791e2a0ecbc3252f073b; bd3694f498daee1ec20358e5108c756a6a0f35a4; 1e8b76a24aec58780af861026c22d1921e0a8e8e; 0b4b46fc8c7fbaa8109f14c9a80b8525594ae330; 17d1c651cac42b2e21c8bba2e95f554cd4ffecf3; 2f139e749351bd62c0eba4b1adf6f412233fac7f; f7975a882f60bd235f735ab4fa1aca0c874110fd; 974bcd92e875822bef9668821778f53014ae98e0; 386d55258f2439c3f7580df3e12d07ade3f7998c; 950a7a6345dece7271e08084e98c99184f490e4f; 4bd92a03b5cb441d8c27c3e91e14687b7558a799; 04a6366f9d76b9219bd2fcbf2337ddfb77e43a1f; 9e74947eab39710958aa499d6bfd27dfa2ae4b91; ad72b29318db69ac5da5dea72a69c87c193e5756; 7f3a526026665284b68d1236523b98eaf9007508; 05d8a16078b981c5536dd852e0e64e78d0024aab; 221c197147a0254131d94ff7057acd103abab0fa; 80f0d79caa4432566c7b7bd162b07cb59a50ddb4,Scientific Reports,5,
6cde6c640eba06b623fcf5355ee926b17d63e7f5,Genome-wide whole blood microRNAome and transcriptome analyses reveal miRNA-mRNA regulated host response to foodborne pathogen Salmonella infection in swine,"To understand the role of miRNAs in regulating genes involved in host response to bacterial infection and shedding of foodborne pathogens, a systematic profiling of miRNAs and mRNAs from the whole blood of pigs upon Salmonella challenge was performed. A total of 62 miRNAs were differentially expressed post infection (false discovery rate <0.1). An integrative analysis of both the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs using sequence-based miRNA target prediction and negative correlation of miRNA-mRNA profiles helped identify miRNA-mRNA networks that may potentially regulate host response to Salmonella infection. From these networks, miR-214 and miR-331-3p were identified as new candidates potentially associated with Salmonella infection. An miRNA seed sequence analysis suggested that these miRNAs regulate several critical immune-related genes including SLC11A1, PIGE-108A11.3 and VAV2. We showed that challenged pigs had reduced miR-214 expression and increased miR-331-3p expression in the whole blood. Furthermore, the expression of the proposed targets of miR-214 (SLC11A1 and PIGE-108A11.3) increased while that of the proposed target of miR-331-3p (VAV2) decreased following challenge (expression changes confirmed by in vitro assays).

6a3f61d773d1c71110bcdbacc1c8344aa0fa50bf,Application of RNA-sequencing to identify transcriptome modification by DCLK1 in colorectal cancer cells,"Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a cancer stem cell marker for the colorectal cancer (CRC). It plays critical roles in the oncogenesis, progression, and metastasis of CRC. DCLK1 can be an intriguing therapeutic target for CRC treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of how DCLK1 functions is unclear currently. In our research, we aim to apply RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology, a high throughput massively Next-generation sequencing approach, to monitor transcriptome changes due to DCLK1 overexpression in the CRC cells. In order to achieve our goal, RNA from quadruplicate samples from two clones of isogenic DCLK1 stable overexpression cells and the parental wild-type HCT116 cells was sent for RNA-Seq on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were evaluated by t-test (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and fold-changeâ€‰Â±â€‰1.5 or greater) using two methods: (1) FWER; and (2) Benjamani and Hochberg FDR (false discovery rate) which corrects for multiple comparisons. Gene networks and functional analysis were evaluated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). We identified 1463 DE genes common for both DCLK1 overexpression clone A and clone B cells. IPA results indicated that 72 canonical pathways were significantly modified by DCLK1 overexpression (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), among which nine out of the top ten pathways are involved in the cell cycle regulation, indicating that DCLK1 might play its tumorigenesis role via activation of pathways facilitating cell proliferation, repression of pathways inhibiting cells proliferation, and function against pathways facilitating cell apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis results confirmed the IPA findings, which demonstrated that DCLK1 overexpression cells had much less G0/G1 cells but much more S and G2/M cells (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In conclusion, DCLK1 overexpression significantly modified transcriptome profile of CRC cancer cells. Control of the cell cycle regulation might be one of the critical mechanism for DCLK1 function. Our findings provide more direct evidence for the development of DCLK1 as a therapeutic target for CRC treatment, and will be of great benefit for the discovery of novel therapeutic target within the DCLK1 molecular network for the treatment of colorectal cancer patients.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lianna Li"", ids = ""50703977""); list(name = ""Hao Mei"", ids = ""152574739""); list(name = ""Abednego Nii Adom Commey"", ids = ""1380049041"")",,68d280accf30bf2f0ab625730263acaf869bb24a; 57c32d6e09f7fd6df176175785372f7cc47ac32f; a361fd69ee83ad4e150f17efc16dc299a126dbe3; a0a17207ad9691eba3db0aac1adbad1486cfb5df; 0ef3eda986298f47fcb3be9ca2747689e478b623; 9077777676811f283c73c637111b767f85fbeddc; 4121e888aa7538fb6d8e0c63618892be9e15220e; e99817789bd5b15001ef117f78d0749184bbc36b; 96b2eeb7060371d50e695fc2a13e483c8790ee51; 70865844e61d0f1865a8a88581aa3c28df2c9f24; cf71493cdab413ab0e6f30c63421f24d676ce64a; 6c981313ee8e92a42aecdabf07c7f38364100abc; 44454f497064a1029322e86be1e4acbc0aae97ed; ea48bf72793b62d1f553c2e27fbace7ef8d74e32; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; ea86d05d3d6912d8bd8f296cec9d2f6c6e00f8e5; b938b3770dab0781cfe03ee02d09ff5dbac4e55f; 4aac548cfa51eaaf3500454fda597e41a7b7513a; 988f24b34ceb5d3cb83d28ee11926da47a91b1b3; c5f8718b0662670d3617369e273c9be78033ba3f; 617c8975c87dd75b498e1fa8337e7f46ec1f2d31; a0bd11b401cea47e5824ac447859bf7469da26c7; 1c2bb5cd9bf51c2d8b883d0946d35354ba992ebc; edc16fef1187baba7d184fdca6c163d15b1de226; 6e89d0529620b1694ce89a378a0fbd6bf848985c; a7e616215f32837d10633fd94bec6f6e07e07bdc; f63a949f393e013353b1d9ebeaf99b29a8d93b11; 9867b7b84fc1fe229e9a9e690a14dad1fee8c3be; b2f0162bfb51319c8f60d96e376c2d1f807b4e23; e98f2fc94c2777802072c89e0d20b64a7a3e64c0; 22758e87f1228168cae32abbf91bc5cc44db5f07; 25b66f68e70c9257ef9b5d96bf3384f9dfe564f5; c67ed5e22bde3764d775076a22d22959f9f4bba8; a2aa231c0046ae97ef860cb9363bf2ce6bbe931f; db34932b014484b39d72e9cdc4d20100d43aed3e; d7693d892f9c9b4b9bac303ba68c0c726377b983; 28a425c858768f7a83fb3f38ebcf9935ca32e2d6; efcedb5970b6f20333f2bdd7804844585e7436b3; 1f65cb1ccc591b6c1a503170f476f0226287ecea; 7f57006b55ec8b0da279e3ef2031823111766fe4; 43769481153790328caa912a7623d2d8d385d37e,Cancer Gene Therapy,,1-11
ebfd7bc162a03e34ef03e4950ab42d67021d2f8a,DiNuP: a systematic approach to identify regions of differential nucleosome positioning,"MOTIVATION
With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the genome-wide profiling of nucleosome positioning has become increasingly affordable. Many future studies will investigate the dynamic behaviour of nucleosome positioning in cells that have different states or that are exposed to different conditions. However, a robust method to effectively identify the regions of differential nucleosome positioning (RDNPs) has not been previously available.


RESULTS
We describe a novel computational approach, DiNuP, that compares nucleosome profiles generated by high-throughput sequencing under various conditions. DiNuP provides a statistical P-value for each identified RDNP based on the difference of read distributions. DiNuP also empirically estimates the false discovery rate as a cutoff when two samples have different sequencing depths and differentiate reliable RDNPs from the background noise. Evaluation of DiNuP showed it to be both sensitive and specific for the detection of changes in nucleosome location, occupancy and fuzziness. RDNPs that were identified using publicly available datasets revealed that nucleosome positioning dynamics are closely related to the epigenetic regulation of transcription.

Many studies find that high frequency oscillations (HFOs) seem to be a very specific indicator of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in recent years. However, it is hard to detect HFOs accurately and many algorithms have a high sensitivity but unsatisfactory specificity. In this study, a novel method combining wavelet decomposition and back propagation (BP) neural network was proposed to increase the specificity of HFOs detection. Three epileptic patients with medically intractable epilepsy were recruited and underwent an individually presurgical monitoring with around 54â€“90 channels of intracranial electroencephalograph (iEEG). Over 3970 analyzed HFOs events from 420 hours of iEEG data, the sensitivity and the false discovery rate (FDR) of the present approach were 90% and 8.50%, respectively. The obtained results showed that the proposed BP neural network combined with wavelet decomposition could obviously decrease the influence of spikes and high-frequency noise caused by patient motion, which both are similar to HFOs, meanwhile effectively improve the specificity of HFOs detection.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Dakun Lai"", ids = ""12413964""); list(name = ""Zenghui Kan"", ids = ""52565480""); list(name = ""Wenjing Chen"", ids = ""47482879""); list(name = ""Heng Zhang"", ids = ""40148092"")",7eebe5c0694cff2cdd2e7eb0da0104cd41e1e7cd,6650892e20a8174a6f7b741e9246bb8dd31bd366; 8518e69df25daf26c79c84e6fe8155bea2a405fa; a31b7f3b375e105f5192fd1c1e80fe27d7332926; 43ddd7ab91dcfd0f3df8fa8021b0f8827cb75d9b; 7e94248595d7d75ae64bcb324cb6a744c2dcf84a; 09b3c396d9a5b59057c7514ad41afbbfac9c7444; 08f3b30844dbb184f508c6a073a10678ac66437d; eb6cd1871e2c9a516d73a19e9c20262074874332,2018 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Conference (BioCAS),,1-4
1a45cc7eefd65f0833ac70a1d6dd349fbcf10e1b,A comparative review of estimates of FDR in small microarray experiments,"The focus of this paper is to illustrate and compare three recently suggested methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes and estimation of the false discovery rate (FDR) and to inversigate whether these FDR estimation methods are biased when we have a small sample size of 3 subjects per group. The methods are estimation of FDR based on averaging of fdr1d (FDR.avg), FDR estimation based on averaging of fdr2d (FDR.avg.fdr2d) and direct estimation of FDR using p-values (FDR.p). The properties are studied in a simulation experiment and a real data example. The comparison results shows that FDR.avg.fdr2d performs better than FDR.p and FDR.avg. The results further show the limitation of performance of the methods in very small sample size such as three subjects per group indicating the importance of developing a new FDR estimation procedure which works well under a situation of small sample size and unequal group variances.",2008,,"list(name = ""Meaza Demissie"", ids = ""1892947"")",,42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a380e424e71ee719ef326d38f2baee2f32752d23; c4b68c32d951ca30c2cd084218a921507d86fe3b; 7ec68a870bd61810ee957b7ffaa3740da86ae9c7; fe11d5bed42567f28b282e2da8e79b458e7eb815; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 1d5b3054f267584dc5a730e9e3754b682d7888b8; 1451d72c1ba2c0ba5ad77cc6f1d6124b68b70a69; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 59d8bae33ee7254a77fe1823439c94fcfc51a8ff; 58d040ec2c2f78400e55215d5f18967f90bb8d8b; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; 6cd45f7034f5bd148c225a477412bfbe18fee0b6; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 422a19e92948a5d1eb5725a0121c2fe3b9b79a5a; ee56a5af58b3ce763d4f70275371c921ec985fc6; 14805a8de6c1c3578f3ba1d84cfc479e7de54206,,,

However, there are studies indicating that some proteins can pass through the intestinal epithelium under normal physiological conditions, perhaps not in sufficient quantities to be of nutritional importance, but in quantities that may be antigenically or biologically active. In the present study, rat intestinal lymph samples were collected using a modified lymph fistula rat model in fasting and cow's milk postprandial states. Low molecular weight proteins were enriched by ultrafiltration and differential solubilization, separated by 1D-SDS-PAGE, digested in-gel based on molecular weight, and identified using nano-LC-MS/MS. In the postprandial rat intestinal lymph, nine bovine-specific proteins (false discovery rate â‰¤1%) were identified in different molecular weight regions. Most proteins identified in lymph were highly abundant proteins in the milk, such as Î²-lactoglobulin and caseins. Seven of the nine identified bovine-specific proteins are allergens in milk. This strategy can be used to search for proteins that can enter the intestinal lymph and analyze their common features. Understanding the common features of these proteins might help to develop protein drugs taken orally, so that therapeutic proteins might embody fusion domains for cross-barrier transport or translocation.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xundou Li"", ids = ""2563953""); list(name = ""Lilong Wei"", ids = ""4597249""); list(name = ""Lulu Jia"", ids = ""39227706""); list(name = ""Menglin Li"", ids = ""144544985""); list(name = ""Lisi Zhu"", ids = ""6374643""); list(name = ""Liu Liu"", ids = ""49480496""); list(name = ""Youhe Gao"", ids = ""39708256"")",,,Proteomics,13 17,"

b328aa0766eb5b6c85e8897327913a636658c224,Subcortical structural abnormalities in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME): MR volumetry and vertex based analysis,"PURPOSE
Imaging studies in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) have shown abnormalities of the thalamus and frontal cortex. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the morphological changes in the deep gray matter (GM) structures using techniques of voxel based morphometry (VBM), MR volumetry and shape analysis.


METHODOLOGY
The study included 40 patients with JME (M:F=21:19; age 22.8Â±5.3 years) and 19 matched controls (M:F=13:6; age 24.5Â±4.2 years). All subjects underwent MRI using standard protocol that included T1-3D TFE (Turbo Field Echo) images with 1mm thickness. VBM analysis and MR volumetry were performed. The volumes of deep subcortical GM structures were extracted and vertex-wise shape analysis was performed using FSL-FIRST (FSL-Integrated Registration and Segmentation Toolbox) software.


RESULTS
VBM analysis with a thalamic mask revealed focal thalamic alterations in the anteromedial aspect of the thalamus (p<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected) which remained significant after adjusting for age, gender and intracranial volume (ICV). Significant volume loss was noted in both the thalami. Vertex-wise shape analysis showed significant focal surface reductions in the thalami bilaterally in patients that were predominantly seen in the medial as well as lateral aspects of the thalamus (p<0.05, FDR corrected). The disease duration correlated with left hippocampus volume while age of onset correlated with right hippocampus volume.


CONCLUSIONS
This study confirms the presence of thalamic alterations in patients with JME. Shape analysis technique provided complementary information and disclosed the presence of focal atrophic changes in patients' thalami. The striatum and hippocampus did not show any significant alterations.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jitender Saini"", ids = ""33098909""); list(name = ""Sanjib Kumar Sinha"", ids = ""143831888""); list(name = ""Bhavani Shankara Bagepally"", ids = ""5170690""); list(name = ""C.

a6ead6a50066a6c824ff9ee020c2540552d19ef9,Hierarchical Bayes models for cDNA microarray gene expression.,"cDNA microarrays are used in many contexts to compare mRNA levels between samples of cells. Microarray experiments typically give us expression measurements on 1000-20 000 genes, but with few replicates for each gene. Traditional methods using means and standard deviations to detect differential expression are not satisfactory in this context. A handful of alternative statistics have been developed, including several empirical Bayes methods. In the present paper we present two full hierarchical Bayes models for detecting gene expression, of which one (D) describes our microarray data very well. We also compare the full Bayes and empirical Bayes approaches with respect to model assumptions, false discovery rates and computer running time. The proposed models are compared to existing empirical Bayes models in a simulation study and for a set of data (Yuen et al., 2002), where 27 genes have been categorized by quantitative real-time PCR. It turns out that the existing empirical Bayes methods have at least as good performance as the full Bayes ones.",2005,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ingrid LÃ¶nnstedt"", ids = ""6208146""); list(name = ""Tom Britton"", ids = ""145575732"")",9cfa8fdbe8c25578afae68b291aab69ed991bdf2; 7de06c99bd635b2bc7dee1261cf8faf9135f406f; 5ff041cb8369d55821854676bbdee7b40c618a78; 9ccaac8953c6c219f0c169672c22bab7af84bbc2; 25c16a40138b7828d438cde53534896c6e683075; 5d73c82a65e085d3edf0a24a6208c873bb82b998; db6f71d83bb6dc38ed37e622b6c61dd731fdb9f3; f481c47328e06ea4b10fc5ce0589cfe70428ec71; cd25f14b6711fe19c71d368c805441f21141dd82; 9f23366aefc487bd1eb508939b42bd6065f092bc; 2ee9aea80a0d0599db1288d16163b1c34a6b48ab; 07dae86af71c58b5eb60ccb5f0c4e98ed12b0d1b; d91830e85f218ad91b1b9379ae42abd752ca9170; dc10302af774e55eea7ee27b5542be2246cb775d; f82b2050f4d624847093c5921ff3cb4e48c8a0f8; 1c5665edac542d90d489ef80ffa851d9c0ed4c27; fbc71a1d5c602190c0b14a075ec9d6b8f269401b; 40b356d0279a1ddd6aeb7a2b595bada19b95de2b; d3faf15fcd760164ff2f06fb79718554ae29f362; 6c081da51493b89daab655c47c522e7651edbd32; e3ff2505f7453eb4840d27d041af08d215f59777; 15fae4fd354063c8b5dd2d035cc2891c621c72c8; 088c45b34a93756b0274d2fe9486bb3305eb63ca; 52cd1d0277e7e23945b70a810f5839633fd2a1a7; fddcd6ee3034ec644a294c54d77f7b2cd20e2e3a; f865ddf85bcf032512b91f7b6eb210125400d202; 69470248e40b342b5fdfd1c31dd9fa5e698804cb; 2346c3838e58e2d39f9501d4cd152d9739a0a7ec; 8f7504ddb9778aeae58d264fe40b6f52c39be29d; 974adb4d033400c0b8596a1c439530b489458b7e; b93d84a97f09664ec72d65682ef460cbac59fa09; dd521fb8a716001928645e1a5d351bd38e9fa055,e5fa9a6dcdd38dbdce7822ab2bdaca9756414b38; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; f59f1225669f34fb2e8c4cff63ca5c250c43157e; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; 44f61f761aab0a2677c6f9cf84e1dbbe442cae2c; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; 2c9ea0c1487a355694264689b304a700015cd55e; 0e7fd9422eaa403b80d708588d48b7d98abe5d63; 1d2e55d466f8d8d7fcd8f8225b67502da6031cd6; f75f2549f7a273432cbe365e94d26a4b0e494281; 81bf9b88d49678b4dde2f9a475ab036aeff79579; 532dddebb64345197ecf4f12e7828a6dd2089252; 178e55a6ef96feeefe5c34b1822f4df9aed2a049; d5dd651e9478a28bacd9b2cb2b7f350548ec0e52; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; ec7278b95eaf7afb551fa27b262295bd21b4a710,Biostatistics,6 2,"

af3e71c96fdcccccfb13b366237fe4aba032054c,Decoy-free protein-level false discovery rate estimation,"MOTIVATION
Statistical validation of protein identifications is an important issue in shotgun proteomics. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a powerful statistical tool for evaluating the protein identification result. Several research efforts have been made for FDR estimation at the protein level. However, there are still certain drawbacks in the existing FDR estimation methods based on the target-decoy strategy.


RESULTS
In this article, we propose a decoy-free protein-level FDR estimation method. Under the null hypothesis that each candidate protein matches an identified peptide totally at random, we assign statistical significance to protein identifications in terms of the permutation P-value and use these P-values to calculate the FDR. Our method consists of three key steps: (i) generating random bipartite graphs with the same structure; (ii) calculating the protein scores on these random graphs; and (iii) calculating the permutation P value and final FDR. As it is time-consuming or prohibitive to execute the protein inference algorithms for thousands of times in step ii, we first train a linear regression model using the original bipartite graph and identification scores provided by the target inference algorithm. Then we use the learned regression model as a substitute of original protein inference method to predict protein scores on shuffled graphs. We test our method on six public available datasets. The results show that our method is comparable with those state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of estimation accuracy.

Inspired by the work of [3], we propose a pseudo-knockoff filter that inherits some advantages of the original knockoff filter and has more flexibility in constructing its knockoff matrix. Moreover, we perform a number of numerical experiments that seem to suggest that the pseudo knockoff filter with the half Lasso statistic has FDR control and offers more power than the original knockoff filter with the Lasso Path or the half Lasso statistic for the numerical examples that we consider in this paper.

Previous studies have revealed heightened circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients, which suggests they may have utility as clinically informative biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of MDD. However, most previous studies have only focused on a small number of inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6) and most have failed to co-vary for potentially important confounding factors. Methods We assessed 42 inflammatory markers in the blood (serum) of 321 control subjects and 887 MDD cases using multiplex electrochemiluminescence methods. We tested whether individual inflammatory marker levels were significantly affected by MDD case/control status, current episode, or current depression severity, co-varying for age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking, current antidepressant use, ethnicity, assay batch and study effects. We further used machine learning algorithms to investigate if we could use our data to blindly diagnose MDD patients or discriminate those in a current episode. We used the false discovery rate (q Results We found broad and powerful influences of confounding factors on log-protein levels. Notably, IL-6 levels were very strongly influenced by Body Mass Index (BMI; p=1.37Ã—10â€“43, variance explained=18%), while Interleukin-16 was the most significant predictor of current depressive episode (p=0.003, variance explained=0.9%, q Discussion To conclude, a wide panel of inflammatory markers alongside clinical information may aid in predicting the onset of symptoms via a machine learning approach, but no single inflammatory proteins are likely to represent clinically useful biomarkers for MDD diagnosis or prognosis. Our study also highlights the need for confounding factors, particularly BMI, to be considered in all future studies pertaining to inflammatory markers.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Timothy Powell"", ids = ""145638566""); list(name = ""HeÌ\201leÌ\201na A.

31a9dbcd8760cb423d555fdc1ac7c86e3f163d00,Comparison of Post Hoc Multiple Pairwise Testing Procedures as Applied to Small k-Group Logrank Tests,"Abstract: The logrank test is widely used to compare groups on distribution of survival time in the presence of censoring. There is no convention for post hoc pairwise comparisons after a significant omnibus k -group logrank test. This simulation study compares four post hoc pairwise testing procedures: Bonferroni, Dunn-Sidak, Hochberg, and unadjusted post hoc logrank test procedure. Evaluation criteria include, familywise type I error rate, correct decision rate, number of correctly rejected pairs, and false discovery rate. We demonstrated that when conditioned upon rejection of the omnibus test, multiplicity adjustments may be unnecessary and can be overly conservative when k is at most 4, or number of comparisons is no greater than 6. This is supported by the results that the performance of the unadjusted post hoc logrank test procedure is preferred over the others on all criteria except for the false discovery rate. The Hochberg procedure appears to be superior among the adjustments examined. Data from a clinical trial for suicide prevention illustrate these approaches where number of comparison groups is often limited.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Moonseong Heo"", ids = ""72048106""); list(name = ""Andrew C.

Genetic variants of some genes in the P38MAPK pathway are reportedly associated with lung cancer risk. To substantiate this finding, we used six genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to comprehensively investigate the associations of 14â€‰904 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 108 genes of this pathway with lung cancer risk. We identified six significant lung cancer risk-associated SNPs in two genes (CSNK2B and ZAK) after correction for multiple comparisons by a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<0.20. After removal of three CSNK2B SNPs that are located in the same locus previously reported by GWAS, we performed the LD analysis and found that rs3769201 and rs7604288 were in high LD. We then chose two independent representative SNPs of rs3769201 and rs722864 in ZAK for further analysis. We also expanded the analysis by including these two SNPs from additional GWAS datasets of Harvard University (984 cases and 970 controls) and deCODE (1319 cases and 26â€‰380 controls). The overall effects of these two SNPs were assessed using all eight GWAS datasets (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.92, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰0.89-0.95, and Pâ€‰=â€‰1.03â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 for rs3769201; ORâ€‰=â€‰0.91, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰0.88-0.95, and Pâ€‰=â€‰2.03â€‰Ã—â€‰10-6 for rs722864). Finally, we performed an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and found that these two SNPs were significantly associated with ZAK mRNA expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines. In conclusion, the ZAK rs3769201 and rs722864 may be functional susceptibility loci for lung cancer risk.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yun Feng"", ids = ""144325322""); list(name = ""Yanru Wang"", ids = ""2604876""); list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Zhensheng Liu"", ids = ""9071783""); list(name = ""Coleman Mills"", ids = ""48571971""); list(name = ""Kouros Owzar"", ids = ""1739590""); list(name = ""Jichun Xie"", ids = ""4999927""); list(name = ""Younghun Han"", ids = ""1871056""); list(name = ""David C.

83ab464de614e1327d1ef183783c43925d959243,Multiple modality biomarker prediction of cognitive impairment in prospectively followed de novo Parkinson disease,"OBJECTIVES
To assess the neurobiological substrate of initial cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) to inform patient management, clinical trial design, and development of treatments.


METHODS
We longitudinally assessed, up to 3 years, 423 newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic PD, untreated at baseline, from 33 international movement disorder centers. Study outcomes were four determinations of cognitive impairment or decline, and biomarker predictors were baseline dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; volume and thickness), diffusion tensor imaging (mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; amyloid beta [AÎ²], tau and alpha synuclein), and 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with PD cognition. Additionally, longitudinal structural MRI and DAT scan data were included. Univariate analyses were run initially, with false discovery rate = 0.2, to select biomarker variables for inclusion in multivariable longitudinal mixed-effect models.


RESULTS
By year 3, cognitive impairment was diagnosed in 15-38% participants depending on the criteria applied. Biomarkers, some longitudinal, predicting cognitive impairment in multivariable models were: (1) dopamine deficiency (decreased caudate and putamen DAT availability); (2) diffuse, cortical decreased brain volume or thickness (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe regions); (3) co-morbid Alzheimer's disease AÎ² amyloid pathology (lower CSF AÎ² 1-42); and (4) genes (COMT val/val and BDNF val/val genotypes).


CONCLUSIONS
Cognitive impairment in PD increases in frequency 50-200% in the first several years of disease, and is independently predicted by biomarker changes related to nigrostriatal or cortical dopaminergic deficits, global atrophy due to possible widespread effects of neurodegenerative disease, co-morbid Alzheimer's disease plaque pathology, and genetic factors.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chelsea Caspell-Garcia"", ids = ""1389989789""); list(name = ""Tanya Simuni"", ids = ""3541427""); list(name = ""Duygu Tosun-Turgut"", ids = ""1404477741""); list(name = ""I-Wei Wu"", ids = ""49445058""); list(name = ""Yihua Zhang"", ids = ""46867852""); list(name = ""Michael A.

893f9517da1f48e9c8fe775bc4008e9225e383da,Genetic Risk Scores in Premature Coronary Artery Disease: Still Only One Piece of the Prevention Puzzle.,"See Article by Theriault et al 

Just over a decade has passed since the publication of the seminal genome-wide association studies identifying the first common susceptibility locus for coronary artery disease (CAD) at the 9p21 locus.1,2 Considerable progress has ensued through ever-expanding meta-analyses of caseâ€“control and cohort studies organized by multiple consortia.3 The most recent large-scale meta-analysis published in 2015 by CARDIoGRAMplusC4D involved genome-wide genetic data imputed to the 1000 genomes panel for the first time.4 This analysis extended the number of loci reaching genome-wide significance to 58 and identified 202 variants in 129 loci with a P value lower than a false discovery rate threshold of 5%. Overall, these loci explain â‰ˆ25% of the heritability of CAD when assuming a multifactorial liability-threshold model, a prevalence of disease of 5%, and a total heritability of CAD of 40%.4

The findings of genome-wide association studies to date provide important insights on the genetic architecture of CAD, the causal mechanisms at play, and the predictive power of genetics. First, they confirm the long-suspected polygenic nature of CAD. The increases in risk among variants on the false discovery rate list were found to be uniformly under 15% per allele for common, and no >53% per allele for rare variants.4 This observation combined with the modest overall variance explained to date suggests that there are many more, as yet unidentified, variants that contribute to the risk of CAD. Second, they corroborate the role of known causal biological pathways of atherosclerosis; whereas at the same time illuminate the importance of new ones.4 The latter is underscored by the observation that only a minority of the CAD loci uncovered to date are also strong signals in genetic studies of traditional risk factors with nearly all of this pleiotropy â€¦",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Themistocles L.

316ba43c27ce1a351f6137926e2f56fc0efb2bff,Sleep Patterns in Adults with a Diagnosis of High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
To examine sleep patterns and sleep problems and their relationship with daytime functioning in adults with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder and no comorbid intellectual disability (high-functioning autism spectrum disorder [HFASD]) compared to neurotypical (NT) adults.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional.


SETTING
Home-based study.


PARTICIPANTS
36 adults with HFASD and 36 age-, intelligence quotient- and sex-matched NT adults.


MEASUREMENTS
Participants completed an online questionnaire battery including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a 14-d sleep wake diary and 14-d actigraphy data collection.


RESULTS
Adults with HFASD had significantly more general sleep disturbances and higher scores on the PSQI, longer sleep onset latencies (actigraphy), and poorer sleep efficiency (diary) and these results remained significant after accounting for the False Discovery Rate. Those adults with HFASD who did not have a comorbid diagnosis of anxiety/depression had significantly shorter total sleep time (diary and actigraphy) compared to NT adults. Compared to NT adults, the HFASD group self-reported significantly poorer refreshment scores upon waking in the morning and higher scores on the daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness subscale of the PSQI.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings support the notion that problems related to sleep, in particular insomnia, continue into adulthood in individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.",2015,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Emma K.

2180f0db957793aa4cf742240c38b65f61cf979f,High-throughput targeted proteomics discovery approach and spontaneous reperfusion in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.,"BACKGROUND
Although spontaneous reperfusion (SR) prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) is associated with improved outcomes, its pathophysiology remains unclear. The objective of the study was to explore associations between SR in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using a multimarker cardiovascular proteins strategy METHODS: We evaluated STEMI patients from the Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial treated with pPCI within 6â€¯hours from symptom onset. SR was core laboratory-defined as pre-PCI Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow 2 or 3. Ninety-one cardiovascular disease-related serum biomarkers drawn prior to PCI were analyzed using a high-throughput ""targeted discovery"" panel. Expression levels for individual biomarkers were compared between patients with/without SR. A hierarchical clustering method of biomarkers identified clusters of biomarkers that differentiated the 2 groups. Associations between individual biomarkers and clusters with SR were further evaluated by multivariable logistic regression.


RESULTS
Of 683 patients studied, 290 had spontaneous reperfusion; those with compared to without SR were more likely noninferior STEMI and had lower clinical acuity and lower baseline levels of troponin and creatine kinase. SR was associated with a lower occurrence of 90-day composite of death, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock. Fifty-two of 91 individual biomarkers were significantly univariably associated with SR. Forty-five remained significant with adjustment for false discovery rate. Using cluster analysis, 26 biomarkers clusters were identified, explaining 72% of total covariance, and 13 biomarker clusters were significantly associated with SR after multivariable adjustment. SR was associated with higher mean expression levels of proteins in all 13 clusters. The cluster most strongly associated with SR consisted of novel proteins across various distinct, yet interlinked, pathobiological processes (kallikrein-6, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, matrix mettaloproteinaise-3, and elafin).


CONCLUSIONS
Spontaneous reperfusion prior to pPCI in STEMI was associated with a lower risk of adverse clinical events. These exploratory data from a targeted discovery proteomics platform identifies novel proteins across diverse, yet complementary, pathobiological axes that show promise in providing mechanistic insights into spontaneous reperfusion in STEMI.


CONDENSED ABSTRACT
Spontaneous reperfusion has been established with improved STEMI outcomes, yet its pathobiology is unclear and appears to involve diverse physiological processes. Using a 91-biomarker high-throughput proteomics platform, we studied 683 STEMI patients in the APEX AMI trial (290 had core laboratory-adjudicated pre-PCI TIMI 2/3 flow) and identified 52 proteins that univariably associate with spontaneous reperfusion. Cluster analysis identified 26 biomarker clusters (explaining 72% of total variance), 13 of which, after multivariable adjustment, were significantly associated with spontaneous reperfusion. Four proteins (kallikrein-6, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, matrix mettaloproteinaise-3, and elafin) across diverse, yet complementary, pathways appear to be associated most strongly with spontaneous reperfusion.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jay S.

2be1c97b1039d1a34fd01de0159fdb35eab100d5,Nonparametric expression analysis using inferential replicate counts,"A primary challenge in the analysis of RNA-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates arising from the quantification step. Most popular methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate uncertainty. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for RNA-seq differential expression may have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account inferential uncertainty, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. We propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing SAMseq method to account for inferential uncertainty. We compare our method, Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, assessing differential expression between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon test.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anqi Zhu"", ids = ""48140148""); list(name = ""Avi Srivastava"", ids = ""145702094""); list(name = ""Joseph G.

Over the range 0.03 h Mpc-1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 0.15 h Mpc-1, the amplitudes of these three power spectra are related through a simple linear-biasing model with b = 1.5 and b = 3.6 for Abell/ACO versus APM and Abell/ACO versus PSCz, respectively. Furthermore, the shape of these power spectra are remarkably similar despite the fact that they are comprised of significantly different objects (individual galaxies through to rich clusters). Individually, each of these surveys shows visible evidence for ""valleys"" in their power spectraâ€”i.e., departures from a smooth featureless spectrumâ€”at similar wavenumbers. We use a newly developed statistical technique called the false discovery rate to show that these valleys are statistically significant. One favored cosmological explanation for such features in the power spectrum is the presence of a nonnegligible baryon fraction (Î©b) in the universe, which causes acoustic oscillations in the transfer function of adiabatic inflationary models. We have performed a maximum likelihood marginalization over four important cosmological parameters of this model (Î©m, Î©b, ns, and H0). We use a prior on H0 = 69 Â± 15 and find Î©mh2 = 0.12, Î©bh2 = 0.029, and ns = 1.08 (2 Ïƒ confidence limits), which are fully consistent with the favored values of these cosmological parameters from the recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. This agreement strongly suggests that we have detected baryonic oscillations in the power spectrum of matter at a level expected from a cold dark matter model normalized to fit these CMB measurements.",2001,Physics,"list(name = ""Christopher J.

d429df890de00933a2b21dc6ff137b1807a5fe54,Identification of altered MicroRNA expression in canine lymphoid cell lines and cases of B- and T-Cell lymphomas.,"Canine lymphoma is a common spontaneous tumor with many similarities to human lymphoma, and thus has potential to be an important animal model of lymphomagenesis. This study determined that microRNA (miRNA) expression in canine tumors can be assessed using a commercially available human cancer miRNA qPCR array. miRNA expression in six different canine lymphoid cell lines and in naturally occurring canine B- and T-cell lymphomas was compared using RNA harvested from normal canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and normal lymph nodes (LN) as controls. We found that false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing after quantile normalization controlled for variation across arrays and that they were the best methods for normalization and statistical analysis. Increases in miRNAs known to upregulate oncogenes (miR19a+b, miR17-5p) and decreased expression of miRNAs with tumor suppressor functions (miR-203, miR-218, and miR-181a) also seen in human lymphoid malignancies were observed. However, there were few similarities between canine groups. The results of this study indicate that the use of both PBMC and LN cells as controls provides different, but potentially equally important targets for further analysis. Our findings of miRNA dysregulation in canine lymphoid cell lines and clinical cases of lymphoma emphasize the potential of canine lymphoma as an important spontaneous, large animal model of human B- and T-cell lymphomas.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Elizabeth W.

523b0d10acf2f686a87d89836f479b60037ecbee,Gene expression profiling of rootstock â€˜140Ruâ€™ and Vitis vinifera L. cv. â€˜Crimson Seedlessâ€™ grape roots infected with grape phylloxera,"Abstract
Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifolia Fitch) is the most devastating pest of grape. Information concerning the molecular basis of grape rootâ€“phylloxera interactions will enhance the future development of effective management tools against this pest. In this study, changes in gene transcript abundance in grape roots in response to phylloxera infestation were measured using the Affymetrix Vitis vinifera Genome Array. Two genetically related grape roots, rootstock â€˜140Ruâ€™ (potted â€˜140Ruâ€™, which forms nodosities but no tuberosities in response to phylloxera infestation) and V. vinifera L. cv. â€˜Crimson Seedlessâ€™ (which forms both nodosities and tuberosities) were utilized in the current study. Pairwise comparisons followed by false discovery rate analysis indicated that the expression levels of 1,204 transcripts changed significantly in â€˜140Ruâ€™; 599 increased and 625 decreased. However, in â€˜Crimson Seedlessâ€™, the expression of 799 transcripts changed significantly, including 305 that increased and 494 that decreased. Comparative analysis of these transcripts indicated that a total of 155 transcripts were common to both resistance and susceptible responses. In this set, the levels of 48 transcripts increased in â€˜140Ruâ€™ but decreased in â€˜Crimson Seedlessâ€™. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed the results of the microarray analysis. Since nodosities potentially function as nutrient reservoirs, probe sets corresponding to the categories of energy metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were more commonly induced in â€˜Crimson Seedlessâ€™. Defense responses of â€˜140Ruâ€™ to phylloxera attack were detected. Probe sets that were uniquely induced in â€˜140Ruâ€™ are associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. This study may aid in the identification of genes involved in plant defenses against grape phylloxera.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Yuanpeng Du"", ids = ""7712935""); list(name = ""En-shun Jiang"", ids = ""6726404""); list(name = ""Feng-Pan Wang"", ids = ""5199743""); list(name = ""Shi-zhong Zhang"", ids = ""51053247""); list(name = ""Heng Zhai"", ids = ""3984028"")",ecc44abbf10ef2761572b641522a7356a0d767c6; 783af3360ade6cd0f440aadda9fa11ae74ea15c2; c2e0eb20bbacc173f05792e56e6429c28ff946e4; 9d4cfb5a94611a6507fb9767f9bf43690ed669b4; ff466035349533e01941da4653bf1694db579709; ac29f54f12f1f9dcee1935ae4e290286584aa7ce; c780541cf40d2a28ca7ce9ed67ec90eb91626424; 6bee7fde73dd3a5528766c8e8abe1b120a58255f,a7ae24c82ff3fb6c37832b31632a3cc84ab4d504; a9bca38efce705418bcf23247f2a1a2942662db9; 4191b7665bad40792c6060e80c29a596be3a925e; 1a4b568ec8afff398acd0c37fc2d6d698fb2895e; b43deade4c094fe5f660687bedaf91ad90ce89ec; 0de802dc79f849dbb280875a4e255bfb0494cee3; 16d4ba9cc1d46d452a40ba7faae870a1c4a36cc0; b41e514c37caccbe906b3358da963840d6b17b84; 63538abe68ea0087fcf151542101fa3d496afdab; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; f622a1a0e877f8478c9d3c2f04387ce0db961ef9; d6d7f5adfe3d152fe690f0aa81df9285550876b0; 21c24fe0a674fddfa81ea33f00462ce84b8c365f; 181f9a4a1cdc55f9de13797b2551196f82675f51; b1b1fe8ed7ccd80b4a4bc80971eade1898b7bd7e; e38f7c5fbd2f2f1f8406a0932ae946fce104ce7c; 4636cce5603aded1d9ed7f02a2a99258e352ea9e; b639f891669460c73811093bad6adf9c098f6c5d; 0ad1071b619adbbeff238f6fee1f035145f3b7aa; 225cf2c7d8a988e3dd18a4b88d2170d8298a2919; 7631a0d8d234182400be06887d39cdfb4ea2e0be; 2c805e82979c1532e52fb0fdd017fe01d3b17c1d; b8655e16ad06787830eeb0afd3dbbd9d8be27b0f; dffd8dc57a672a0cbd71f75d3ddb22da6559b360; 8925998b6d5330b5aa8b49671b9927a6f46d4d0f; 67da43c14466f6b997ed19ef7d56690184557877; 0a6931b94ea5c322630639b797e398021b269793; ce52dfe37b0c8365314993102e4b41dbb200c906,Plant Growth Regulation,73,1-8
0c538fb9a55f1992c994356af1378fd87345dd70,Multiplex Screen of Serum Biomarkers in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy.,"BACKGROUND
Recent studies have proposed a unified genetic model for Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), identifying potential therapeutic targets for future clinical trials. Serum biomarkers related to disease activity will be important for proof of concept or early phase clinical studies.


OBJECTIVE
To identify potential serum biomarkers in FSHD for possible use in future clinical trials.


METHODS
We performed a prospective cross-sectional study of serum biomarkers in 22 FSHD patients (19 FSHD1, 3 FSHD2) compared to 23 age and gender-matched healthy controls using a commercial multiplex, microsphere-based immune-fluorescent assay of 243 markers (Myriad, Human Discovery MAP 250, v2.0).


RESULTS
169 markers had values sufficient for analysis. Correction for multiple testing identified 7 biomarkers below a 5% false discovery rate: creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB, 6.52 fold change, P < 0.0001), tissue-type plasminogen activator (PLAT, 1.64 fold change, P < 0.0001), myoglobin (2.23 fold change, P = 0.0001), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 2.33 fold change, P = 0.0004), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (1.48 fold change, P = 0.0004), CD 40 ligand (1.89 fold change, P = 0.001), and vitronectin (VTN, 1.28 fold change, P = 0.001). Moderate correlations to measures of FSHD disease were seen for CKMB, PLAT, and EGF.

We report on a replicated GWAS in dairy cattle using 1,945 progeny tested bulls genotyped with three high density SNP panels representing 63,678 informative SNP. Single SNP genotypes were analysed against deregressed EBV for protein percent and fat percent using a mixed linear model accounting for SNP and animal polygenic effects. The 127,356 analyses (63,678 informative SNP by two traits) across the two data sets identified 143 and 87 significant (P<0.05, corrected for False Discovery Rate) associations for protein % in data set 1 and 2 respectively, whilst for fat % 102 and 61 significant associations were identified in the two data sets respectively.

To estimate deletion-genotype likelihood, we extracted read-depth (RD) data of all the bi-allelic variants within a given deletion locus, and fitted a Gaussian mixture model to the observed RD. We validated our method on brachyspina associated deletion of chromosome 21 (Chr21:21,184,869-21,188,202), which was segregating in our deletion-discovery population of Holstein cattle. We analysed the RD data of 55 progeny tested Holstein bulls with published recessive code for brachyspina (8 carriers and 47 non-carriers) along with 5 carriers from the discovery population (confirmed by assembling the breakpoint sequences). Using our approach we were able to genotype the carriers and non-carriers with 95% accuracy, and a false discovery rate of 18.8%.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Mesbah-Uddin"", ids = ""81876752""); list(name = ""Bernt Guldbrandtsen"", ids = ""6243229""); list(name = ""Mogens SandÃ¸ Lund"", ids = ""2469480""); list(name = ""Goutam Sahana"", ids = ""4320277"")",94151539e0b5304f3a7b2eadfa2e869c65765057,9c828ff2b310024764cdbf5604ee2c47513fb243; 7eabb7a308adeeb1a0f26ef181c34ba8f933511b; 491ba4ab5b0b2dc72d22f0e3d45a10503e3dc594; 49dde8641a28a59c6d9fc2324afbae553efe91e5; 9a67e2a2fc435c83ec8e085c7068477c620afd2e; dd38f1c6f5b6337c815de3a63b9e4a731050deb2; 803a83becf0c19170e9d3b9fc155f072177b6c4b; 051c1e07016c37e37c6d39d77798655e943e34ba,,,662

LVM is a complex, quantitative trait with genetic and environmental risk factors. This research characterizes the genetic architecture of LVM in an African-American population by examining the main and interactive effects of individual candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and conventional risk factors for increased LVM.MethodsWe used least-squares linear regression to investigate 1,878 SNPs from 234 candidate genes for SNP main effects, SNP-risk factor interactions, or SNP-SNP interactions associated with LVM in 1,328 African-Americans from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study. We reduced the probability of false positive results by implementing three analytic criteria: 1) the false discovery rate, 2) cross-validation, and 3) testing for internal replication of results.ResultsWe identified 409 SNP-SNP interactions passing all three criteria, while no SNP main effects or SNP-risk factor interactions passed all three. A multivariable model including four SNP-SNP interactions explained 11.3% of the variation in LVM in the full GENOA sample and 5.6% of LVM variation in independent test sets.ConclusionsThe results of this research underscore that context dependent effects, specifically SNP-SNP interactions, may dominate genetic contributions to variation in complex traits such as LVM.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristin J.

In the present study, we describe a modified method for the isolation and enrichment of S-nitrosylated (SNO) proteins from brain tissue based on a biotin labeling system using the biotin switch technique (BST). Various working conditions for the incubation of biotin-labeled samples with streptavidin beads and for the elution of SNO proteins from streptavidin beads were comparatively evaluated. The working conditions were optimized with incubation at a ratio of 1:3 (streptavidin beads/brain homogenates) at 25ËšC for 120 min, and the elution conditions were optimized using buffer containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Under these conditions, we found that at least 12 rounds of successive incubation were required in order to recover all the SNO proteins in the human and rodent brain homogenates. Western blot analyses of some of the eluted products confirmed the reliable immunoreactivity of the isolated SNO proteins. iTRAQ-based mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of the eluted products from the brain tissues of a normal healthy subject and patients with various prion diseases identified 1,509 SNO proteins with high confidence [false discovery rate (FDR) <1%]. These data indicate that with this optimized method, the endogenous SNO proteins from the brain tissue of humans and rodents can be sufficiently isolated, which can then be used directly in further assays, such as large-scale analysis of the S-nitrosoproteome in complex backgrounds.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lina Chen"", ids = ""2033349""); list(name = ""Qi Shi"", ids = ""145839868""); list(name = ""Xiao-mei Zhang"", ids = ""2275726""); list(name = ""Bao-yun Zhang"", ids = ""1963353""); list(name = ""Y.

A frequentist solution to this problem is using False Discovery Rate controlling multiple testing procedures to select the parameters and constructing False Coverage-statement Rate adjusted confidence intervals for the selected parameters. We argue that selection also affects Bayesian inference and present a Bayesian framework for providing inference for selected parameters. We explain the role of selection in controlling the occurrence of false discoveries in Bayesian analysis and demonstrate how to specify selection criteria.

ee252ac2f812379dd5d286a2bac59bb13f2a9186,Genome-wide analysis of core promoter elements from conserved human and mouse orthologous pairs,"BackgroundThe canonical core promoter elements consist of the TATA box, initiator (Inr), downstream core promoter element (DPE), TFIIB recognition element (BRE) and the newly-discovered motif 10 element (MTE). The motifs for these core promoter elements are highly degenerate, which tends to lead to a high false discovery rate when attempting to detect them in promoter sequences.ResultsIn this study, we have performed the first analysis of these core promoter elements in orthologous mouse and human promoters with experimentally-supported transcription start sites. We have identified these various elements using a combination of positional weight matrices (PWMs) and the degree of conservation of orthologous mouse and human sequences â€“ a procedure that significantly reduces the false positive rate of motif discovery. Our analysis of 9,010 orthologous mouse-human promoter pairs revealed two combinations of three-way synergistic effects, TATA-Inr-MTE and BRE-Inr-MTE. The former has previously been putatively identified in human, but the latter represents a novel synergistic relationship.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that DNA sequence conservation can greatly improve the identification of functional core promoter elements in the human genome. The data also underscores the importance of synergistic occurrence of two or more core promoter elements. Furthermore, the sequence data and results presented here can help build better computational models for predicting the transcription start sites in the promoter regions, which remains one of the most challenging problems.",2005,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Victor X.

c2824f335c07826966f246b56e8ca12000e06da6,Gene expression profiles of autophagy-related genes in multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an imflammatory disease of central nervous system caused by genetic and environmental factors that remain largely unknown. Autophagy is the process of degradation and recycling of damaged cytoplasmic organelles, macromolecular aggregates, and long-lived proteins. Malfunction of autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, and autophagy genes may modulate the T cell survival. We aimed to examine the expression levels of autophagy-related genes. The blood samples of 95 unrelated patients (aged 17-65years, 37 male, 58 female) diagnosed as MS and 95 healthy controls were used to extract the RNA samples. After conversion to single stranded cDNA using polyT priming: the targeted genes were pre-amplified, and 96Ã—78 (samplesÃ—primers) qRT-PCR reactions were performed for each primer pair on each sample on a 96.96 array of Fluidigm BioMarkâ„¢. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, gene expression levels of ATG16L2, ATG9A, BCL2, FAS, GAA, HGS, PIK3R1, RAB24, RGS19, ULK1, FOXO1, HTT were significantly altered (false discovery rate<0.05). Thus, altered expression levels of several autophagy related genes may affect protein levels, which in turn would influence the activity of autophagy, or most probably, those genes might be acting independent of autophagy and contributing to MS pathogenesis as risk factors. The indeterminate genetic causes leading to alterations in gene expressions require further analysis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mehri IÄŸci"", ids = ""152341728""); list(name = ""Mehmet Baysan"", ids = ""2543860""); list(name = ""Remzi YiÄŸiter"", ids = ""6049643""); list(name = ""Mustafa UlaÅŸlÄ±"", ids = ""6261255""); list(name = ""SÄ±rma Geyik"", ids = ""8327529""); list(name = ""Recep Bayraktar"", ids = ""5341590""); list(name = ""Ibrahim Bozgeyik"", ids = ""74224389""); list(name = ""Esra Bozgeyik"", ids = ""4507252""); list(name = ""Ali Turan Bayram"", ids = ""144844184""); list(name = ""Ecir Ali Ã‡akmak"", ids = ""40161142"")",1df1cdd492c70e3295f17e6034ff110e48ee5c22; d4bd46df77c20964f23b930ce2633a08dd78e53b; 254d4c35ea6baad8b0c9ea36c695bb44aad0e94c; 4ecc2ab65cf376a022185d6995b2c6a18965d119; 3ac65aaa11208edf5823e3bbe6c128e9d14d09ef; 9f96a864ef697150ab8935e38d1e4725ee5bb315; c545ee771b11db774a7dc663ef36332d5cb1f728; 5e6c3bb7b84d51ba711716bc077781a50a630c03; 2670bad78ea9b32bbbe1aff992e2079d514ee30f; 0ef8b8f91bfd6d1840ffcc372aa212123e2bf35a; ce4e8f998dc28892312a2509694f156d9c56d51e; 07fa38da1310a8c0a590a6e6a0ec67ed611f2163; 7ee2de5622ba3d73140850c4ce3b0f1880e9a563; 2026698940d64d0d81a4c87dad61e8dd7dada5ce; 4baa609dd400fed2416f12e307419737cd05ada8; c832eff87358e3afe70791e756879c5bdcf99169; 2d39fd74d5656a485c72df613fcf9ec5fc8f3a46,,Gene,588 1,"

Even if there is no real change, the traditional p = 0.05 can cause 5% of the investigated tests being reported significant. Multiple testing corrections have been developed to solve this problem. Here the authors describe the one-step (Bonferroni), multi-step (step-down and step-up) and graphical methods. However, sometimes a correction for multiple testing creates more problems, than it solves: the universal null hypothesis is of little interest, the exact number of investigations to be adjusted for can not determined and the probability of type II error increases. For these reasons the authors suggest not to perform multiple testing corrections routinely. The calculation of the false discovery rate is a new method for genome-wide studies. Here the p value is substituted by the q value, which also shows the level of significance. The q value belonging to a measurement is the proportion of false positive measurements when we accept it as significant. The authors propose using the q value instead of the p value in genome-wide studies.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Balazs L.

a45ebcd2e95182cdb99693615a7bf93196f846d2,Award Number: DAMD17-02-1-0159 TITLE: Hepatocyte Growth Factor and Interleukin-6 in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis,"Background. Androgen ablative therapy is the principal treatment for advanced prostate cancer, which in most cases has metastasized to bone. Upon androgen deprivation, metastatic prostate cancers frequently progress to androgen independence, which renders the disease incurable. Resistance to anti-androgen therapy may in part be caused by factors from the bone stroma that promote tumor growth. These include IL-6, hepatocyte growth factor, and TGF-Î², since their synthesis is suppressed by steroid hormones and since the bone cells elaborating these factors express androgen receptors. Their production could potentially up on androgen-ablative therapy. To identify growth factors that are negatively regulated by androgen, we applied cDNA array technology to two complementary model systems, in-vivo mouse bone and cultures of human primary bone-derived cells, stably expressing the AR. Here we present our findings in the mouse model. Methods. Four pairs of C57BL/6J mice were castrated or sham-operated at week 7 and sacrificed at week 20. Long bones were collected and the bone marrow was flushed. Either total (marrow) or amplified RNA (bone) from each pair was used to generate cy3 or cy5 labeled samples for hybridization to our custom-made cDNA array that contained 10,000 genes with enrichment of genes expressed in mouse prostate. Sample labeling was altered with both dyes to exclude dye bias. Array data were analyzed with GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics). Results. Gene expression profiles from the three pairs of samples were highly consistent. Of the 10,000 genes examined, 52 genes in bone and 76 genes in bone marrow were significantly altered in androgen deprived versus control mice (P < 0.05 as in student t-test). These included 47 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated genes in bone, and 71 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated genes in bone marrow. There were 15 genes in both samples in common, which was unrelated to bone marrow contamination, as indicated with marrow-specific markers Runx1 and Cbfb. Since this cDNA approach was designed to identify growth factor systems that were up-regulated upon androgen deprivation, we specifically searched for growth factor related mRNAs in the gene list. As candidates emerged members of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis and the Sox family transcription factors that regulate the activity of fibroblast growth factor-4. Conclusions. Androgen-deprivation affects the expression of a variety of genes in bone and bone marrow. The stimulation of the IGF axis upon androgen withdrawal may paradoxically lead to increased growth and survival of prostate cancer cells in the bone environment and may be the underlying cause for treatment failure and progression of metastatic prostate cancer to androgenindependence. SURGICAL CASTRATION INCREASES THE SYNTHESIS OF GROWTH FACTORS IN THE BONE MICROENVIRONMENT Chang Xu, Peter S. Nelson and Beatrice S. Knudsen Division of Public Health Sciences, Program in Cancer Biology, M5-A864, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N. , Seattle, Washington, 98109 Background. Androgen ablative therapy is the principal treatment for advanced prostate cancer, which in most cases has metastasized to bone. Upon androgen deprivation, metastatic prostate cancers frequently progress to androgen independence, which renders the disease incurable. Resistance to anti-androgen therapy may in part be caused by factors from the bone stroma. Because certain growth factors and cytokines are normally suppressed by steroid hormones, we postulated that androgen-ablative therapies increase the local growth promoting activities in the bone marrow and that this may stimulate tumor growth and progression to androgenindependence. Methods. C57BL/6J mice were castrated or sham-operated at week 7 and sacrificed at 17 weeks (young) or one year later (old). Long bones were collected and in one set of mice, the bone marrow and bone were analyzed separately. If amounts of RNA were insufficient, one round amplification was conducted before Cy3 or Cy5 labeling and hybridization onto customized PEDB arrays, enriched in prostate-expressed sequences. We corrected the local background by Lowess normalization using Silicon Genetics GeneSpring 6.2 software and identified and selected genes with a 1.5 fold expression difference and a false discovery rate (FDR) around 1% using SAM (Tusher et al., 2001) (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/). Results. Differentially expressed genes in paired castrated and sham-operated mice were highly consistent. A total of 116 of 10,000 genes were differentially expressed after castration for 10 weeks. In the bone marrow, 74 genes were upand 30 were down-regulated, while in bone, 32 genes were upand 3 were down-regulated. After one year castration, 53 genes were upand 6 down regulated in the bone and bone marrow. Twenty of the up-regulated and none of the down-regulated genes were in common between, bone and bone marrow of young and and old mice in all 9 separate expression profiles. Four of these, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase isoform 1b, SRY-box containing gene 4 (Sox4), and interleukin 7 receptor are interesting because they may be directly involved in the regulation of tumor growth in the bone marrow microenvironment. Conclusions. We demonstrate that surgical castration changes gene expression in the bone marrow. Several of the genes encode secreted or cell surface proteins and may regulate interactions between tumor cells and the bone marrow microenvironment. Thus, it is conceivable that androgen-ablative therapies increase growth factor concentrations in the bone marrow microenvironment and that this may promote progression of tumor cells that are resistent to the cytotoxic effects of androgen-ablative treatments.",2007,,"list(name = ""Beatrice S.

The lower costs associated with RNA-Seq have made it the preferred technology for transcriptomic analysis. However, concordance between RNA-Seq and microarray analyses in dose response studies has not been adequately vetted.ResultsWe compared the hepatic transcriptome of C57BL/6 mice following gavage with sesame oil vehicle, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30Â Î¼g/kg TCDD every 4Â days for 28Â days using Illumina HiSeq RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and Agilent 4Ã—44 K microarrays using the same normalization and analysis approach. RNA-Seq and microarray analysis identified a total of 18,063 and 16,403 genes, respectively, that were expressed in the liver. RNA-Seq analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) varied dramatically depending on the P1(t) cut-off while microarray results varied more based on the fold change criteria, although responses strongly correlated. Verification by WaferGen SmartChip QRTPCR revealed that RNA-Seq had a false discovery rate of 24% compared to 54% for microarray analysis. Doseâ€“response modeling of RNA-Seq and microarray data demonstrated similar point of departure (POD) and ED50 estimates for common DEGs.ConclusionsThere was a strong correspondence between RNA-Seq and Agilent array transcriptome profiling when using the same samples and analysis strategy.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is a subpopulation of accessible and functional immune cells. Comparative analysis of the proteome of PBMCs can help us elucidate the mechanism of disease and find potential biomarkers for diagnosis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
PBMCs were collected from healthy individuals, patients with benign diseases, and pancreatic cancer. iTRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS and SWATH methodologies were applied to make a comparative proteomics analysis of PBMCs.


RESULTS
A total of 3,357 proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) <1% were identified, of which 114 proteins were found dysregulated in the PC group. An extensive SWATH library was constructed which showed a potential application for large scale clinical sample analysis.

3d22b8508a88f2424d97e210bedcb7d21c0fa586,Bioinformatics and functional analyses of key genes in smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma,"Smoking is one of the most important factors associated with the development of lung cancer. However, the signaling pathways and driver genes in smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma remain unknown. The present study analyzed 433 samples of smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma and 75 samples of non-smoking lung adenocarcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the ggplot2 R/Bioconductor package. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed using the R packages RSQLite and org.Hs.eg.db. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to screen factors associated with patient survival. Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyze the potential clinical significance of the identified biomarkers as molecular prognostic markers for the five-year overall survival time. A total of 373 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; |log2-fold change|â‰¥2.0 and P<0.01) were identified, of which 71 were downregulated and 302 were upregulated. These DEGs were associated with 28 significant GO functions and 11 significant KEGG pathways (false discovery rate <0.05). Two hundred thirty-eight proteins were associated with the 373 differentially expressed genes, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that 7 mRNAs, cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1, PKHD1 like 1, retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65, neurotensin receptor 1, fetuin B, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit, significantly distinguished between non-smoking and smoking-associated adenocarcinomas. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in the 7 mRNAs-high-risk group had a significantly worse prognosis than those of the low-risk group. The data obtained in the current study suggested that these genes may serve as potential novel prognostic biomarkers of smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dajie Zhou"", ids = ""10988316""); list(name = ""Yi-lin Sun"", ids = ""2674222""); list(name = ""Yanfei Jia"", ids = ""47417140""); list(name = ""Duanrui Liu"", ids = ""35386409""); list(name = ""Jing Wang"", ids = ""40514586""); list(name = ""Xiaowei Chen"", ids = ""48518047""); list(name = ""Yuanghang Zhang"", ids = ""46867877""); list(name = ""Xiaoli Ma"", ids = ""50088445"")",,ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 260f78e97fe715fcff3a0003d018d6616c3e62e7; d92f92c1d75ec97404ad33f522c0fe24b531364f; 2d3041fe5e41ec889d0e0654ba198c21b39178d1; f9d6b112cc0ac8aca72ea0ca4657036092ec6b62; e606d904d4d77157087872c0fa3702babab7b337; d5f4ff2b0bbf7cd6259f2123ab0ecbea9ccb790e; 561592484388509c2c6398a685d99a1561ce1b18; e12db4a53a208c56061390aeda06a66d716364a7; fa24583d43edee36e4c38c7f523d81ae7bbc0288; 395b1a7b4de1ee580b4ba725cb9d04b4d270c362; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; 7a4dec0dacddca21461e3a39d2470b35222414bd; d0d1ef54fc76c26932cf324cda1e19a7d746b88e; 63763771b3bdc3c127449b2ca41aa00c6f889d66; 567681bcd6e71a3a329cba8ec028a49f403ae6b0; ca1dc1f7c78dbf7e07616b33012cf1575a9106fb; 127eeddc77db8f9edd3b09135d4817090dd297a0; 513ebdf92a82d4a1488e9dc162f432b73a6dd9a6; 0a2fbdb99103b434adbec4deb87c114a14f38739; 9663a80a9b30992ca18592809985662098f91013; 4f28a6cccdf4b7b0e3192c490a5e3507efe6346f; f2c64c152186955731c976180fe1f4b01b359943; 40dcdab5af3c06ea2b1a0b254ba4c30dcadf32bc; 250c2b83923d414dc17611e5959b47a99a42747e; 62c480d4556ec753056c5d387ff59b19b82e3c9c; 8179be03a4357fdc2e57ea844925a358b95bc30e; 811c5d4ea115d9496b8e20de6baf86817a94e348; d793a99ce9f2102952d55627c60afb3f9138d4f2; 5fa0bb7021ba2ae70d47160505bf92c60382f424; 73f7eb0a74d9c5de8fb59155f758863b17759778; 38ebb3c38232169d4512b06d29c2d4ba9de834ed; daa66b72e5d7d578f1c79cc4781e175312205b95; 1725d223679864718bae98ac678565d7723199f0; 1b6d2c08e5b0b7ec50366b0175d266ed37ab7d77; e1fb4ac8d1092d486b8b3151b5f6eadd5d95f216; 7baafd69ac269e4c51530e6c3cba4fc7881173af; 08bd7ce651c7aa772de24c1df24752404f4b81a5; e87f47a6c763359d609078efed88227c5eb7fa95; e1d563394213c145db19cc5c4a4fd1e7afa376a4; cdd3a13b87e7837659803b7868d36682bb2f6c2e; 2f4d144e090eae198017ff42e190f35a4bd209e3; a8dab7a48fe535ccb095a171b449167ac360e650; 130d7de963b14f8e5b8f1b2f837655a510218b08,Oncology Letters,18,3613 - 3622

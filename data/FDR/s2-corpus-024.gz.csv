a1c8fae866f0ad8dfdde186bebfb1b5d5049f47a,Iron deficiency modifies gene expression variation induced by augmented hypoxia sensing.,"In congenital Chuvash polycythemia (CP), VHL(R200W) homozygosity leads to elevated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) levels at normoxia. CP is often treated by phlebotomy resulting in iron deficiency, permitting us to examine the separate and synergistic effects of iron deficiency and HIF signaling on gene expression. We compared peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression profiles of eight VHL(R200W) homozygotes with 17 wildtype individuals with normal iron status and found 812 up-regulated and 2120 down-regulated genes at false discovery rate of 0.05. Among differential genes we identified three major gene regulation modules involving induction of innate immune responses, alteration of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and down-regulation of cell proliferation, stress-induced apoptosis and T-cell activation. These observations suggest molecular mechanisms for previous observations in CP of lower blood sugar without increased insulin and low oncogenic potential. Studies including 16 additional VHL(R200W) homozygotes with low ferritin indicated that iron deficiency enhanced the induction effect of VHL(R200W) for 50 genes including hemoglobin synthesis loci but suppressed the effect for 107 genes enriched for HIF-2 targets. This pattern is consistent with potentiation of HIF-1Î± protein stability by iron deficiency but a trend for down-regulation of HIF-2Î± translation by iron deficiency overriding an increase in HIF-2Î± protein stability.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Xu Sunny Zhang"", ids = ""46447215""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""50549803""); list(name = ""Shwu-Fan Ma"", ids = ""80984587""); list(name = ""Galina Miasniakova"", ids = ""10235160""); list(name = ""Adelina I.

df31c629e51fd5c19fc2bb2ca4b30c47e234ec19,Gene and MicroRNA Expression Responses to Exercise; Relationship with Insulin Sensitivity,"BACKGROUND
Healthy individuals on the lower end of the insulin sensitivity spectrum also have a reduced gene expression response to exercise for specific genes. The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between insulin sensitivity and exercise-induced gene expression in an unbiased, global manner.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Euglycemic clamps were used to measure insulin sensitivity and muscle biopsies were done at rest and 30 minutes after a single acute exercise bout in 14 healthy participants. Changes in mRNA expression were assessed using microarrays, and miRNA analysis was performed in a subset of 6 of the participants using sequencing techniques. Following exercise, 215 mRNAs were changed at the probe level (Bonferroni-corrected P<0.00000115). Pathway and Gene Ontology analysis showed enrichment in MAP kinase signaling, transcriptional regulation and DNA binding. Changes in several transcription factor mRNAs were correlated with insulin sensitivity, including MYC, r=0.71; SNF1LK, r=0.69; and ATF3, r= 0.61 (5 corrected for false discovery rate). Enrichment in the 5'-UTRs of exercise-responsive genes suggested regulation by common transcription factors, especially EGR1. miRNA species of interest that changed after exercise included miR-378, which is located in an intron of the PPARGC1B gene.


CONCLUSIONS
These results indicate that transcription factor gene expression responses to exercise depend highly on insulin sensitivity in healthy people. The overall pattern suggests a coordinated cycle by which exercise and insulin sensitivity regulate gene expression in muscle.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Carrie S.

269557d0a7da1d973a57b8874a0491532b302714,Evaluating FDR and stratified FDR control approaches for high-throughput biological studies,"False discovery rate (FDR) control procedures are commonly used for the correction of multiple testing in high-throughput biological studies. Although the expectation of FDR estimations can be controlled, the variance of the FDR estimations has not been fully analysed. Especially, the effect of the variance of the FDR estimator on the stratified FDR control approach, which is proposed to improve the statistical powers of FDR control procedures, is unclear. In this study, we analyzed the effects of three major factors (the percentage of true null hypotheses, the number of hypotheses and the effect size of true alternative hypotheses) on the performances of the FDR and stratified FDR control approaches. We show that the variance of the FDR estimations tends to be small when at least one of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) the percentage of true null hypotheses is not too large, (2) the number of tests is relatively large, or (3) the effect size of true alternative hypotheses is not too small. We demonstrated that when all the hypotheses are stratified into two groups, the variance of the stratified FDR estimations tends to be small if each group satisfies at least one of the above mentioned conditions. In such a situation, the actual stratified FDR for an experiment tends to be under the given control level.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jinfeng Zou"", ids = ""2755311""); list(name = ""Guini Hong"", ids = ""48375641""); list(name = ""Junjie Zheng"", ids = ""3087493""); list(name = ""Chunxiang Hao"", ids = ""46511191""); list(name = ""Jing Wang"", ids = ""1697912""); list(name = ""Zheng Guo"", ids = ""144663071"")",c3244de2cdc1596d3d7b2f7b036beb4e4ab93b7b,2ca6ebeb44e7d6100129473c69f8f352a8937493; 80389daa307d53b5d6bf7a13c25deba21b5a9b39; 1db5c1d04f85e6886e51b6dde9bb047e2ace3334; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 64067cbc760d3acd0367a2399d3a84eabde81584; 619d8ff694e856110fce6493ffc57eaecf63aeb0; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; dd1b3822a5d94e1de43845a9917be3e6a4ebfbe4; 21e6ddaea5dd700a33eca5b97ce31a9bedfcf88a; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222,2012 IEEE Symposium on Robotics and Applications (ISRA),,684-686
f071f13a9b8fec443ab2cd425e4be0bd698fd3b7,Gene Expression Analysis Of Plasmablastic Lymphoma Identifies Down Regulation Of B Cell Receptor Signaling and Additional Unique Transcriptional Programs,"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is currently recognized as a distinct sub-type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but remains a poorly characterized B-cell malignancy. We conducted gene expression profiling of 15 PBL, 10 DLBCL, and 5 EOP (extraosseous isolated plasmacytoma). 864 genes were significantly over- or under-expressed (at<1% false discovery rate) uniquely in one of these diseases relative to the other two. Of these, 102 were highly expressed in PBL relative to DLBCL and EOP, while 166 showed low expression in PBL. This set of 268 genes defined a distinct transcriptional program operating in PBL. Among these were surface markers such as CD320, CD300A, and IL6 receptor, as well as the cytokine Oncostatin M, which was highly expressed in PBL but almost never expressed in DLBCL or EOP. CD320 plays a role in generation and proliferation of plasma cells in the germinal center in response to IL-10 stimulation, while the immunoglobulin superfamily member CD300 is variably expressed across the hematopoietic hierarchy. The apoptosis-inducer BAX (Bcl-2 associated X protein) was highly expressed in PBL, similar to reports in plasma cell neoplasms. In addition the CpG methyltransferase gene Dnmt3b showed high expression levels in PBL.

By comparing malignancy-specific gene expression patterns to known biological pathways, we found that expression of components of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway ( Cd79a , Cd79b , Blk , Lyn , Syk , Ptprc , Csk , Pik3cd , Swap70 , and Rel ) were repressed by 2-fold or more on average in PBL relative to DLBCL. We observed a similar pattern in EOP relative to DLBCL. In contrast, mitochondrial genes were more highly expressed in PBL than in DLBCL. Analysis against a large compendium of sets of transcription factor targets from motif and ChIP analyses identified that targets of MYB, a major transcriptional regulator of hematopoietic differentiation, were up-regulated in PBL; whereas targets of NFKB1 were repressed relative to DLBCL.

Both PBL and EOP highly expressed genes that have previously been described as up-regulated in plasmacytomas. To further investigate the potential cell of origin of these malignancies, we compared genes expressed in PBL, DLBCL, and EOP to genes that are highly expressed in specific sub-types of B-cells. Genes highly expressed in plasma cells relative to other types of B-cells were highly expressed in PBL and EOP compared to DLBCL. Notably, this included the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), which is a critical regulator of plasma cell differentiation. The plasma cell marker CD138 (syndecan-1, encoded by the Sdc1 gene) was also over-expressed in the PBL and EOP samples.

We have validated the array data by reanalyzing expression of four candidate genes ( Lyn, Syk, SPIB, and Swap70 ) by real time PCR. These four genes were highly expressed in DLBCL, but their expression was low in both in PBL and EOP. The observed overexpression of Swap70 in DLBCL as compared to PBL and EOP was subsequently validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Immunostaining for Swap70 was performed in all 30 cases used for array analysis and was negative in all cases of PBL (0/15 positive) and EOP (0/5 positive) but was diffusely positive in all but one of the DLBCLs (9/10 positive). Swap70 analysis by IHC was subsequently performed in 7 additional cases of DLBCL and was diffusely positive in all of these cases (7/7), thus suggesting that immunohistochemical analysis for Swap70 may be useful in differentiating PBL and EOP from DLBCL.

Overall our results provide insight into the unique transcriptional programs distinguishing PBL from morphologic and clinical mimics DLBCL and EOP, as well as identify similarities between them. Most notably, we observed that B-cell receptor signaling pathway genes are significantly down-regulated in PBL and EOP compared to DLBCL. These findings corroborate the downregulation of surface immunoglobulin expression as seen in PBL and EOP and suggest a biologic similarity between these two neoplasms. Among normal B-cell sub-populations, PBL and EOP were most similar in their expression patterns to plasma cells and plasmablasts in that they expressed several well-known plasma cell markers. These findings additionally identify novel candidate genes that provide opportunities for further phenotypic and functional characterization of these neoplasms.

The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize five drought tolerance candidate genes, namely dehydration responsive element binding 1A (DREB1A), enhanced response to abscisic acid (ERA1-B and ERA1-D ), and fructan 1-exohydrolase (1-FEH-A and 1-FEH-B), in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajimaâ€™s D value, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and (ii) associate withingene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with phenotypic traits in a spring wheat association mapping panel (n = 126). Field trials were grown under contrasting moisture regimes in Greeley, CO, and Melkassa, Ethiopia, in 2010 and 2011. Genome-specific amplification and DNA sequence analysis of the genes identified SNPs and revealed differences in nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajimaâ€™s D, and patterns of LD. DREB1A showed associations (false discovery rate adjusted probability value = 0.1) with normalized difference vegetation index, heading date, biomass, and spikelet number.

e8d2d5146dd10dc3c31ee64f0102cce4377d3d76,Associations between Flavonoid Intakes and Gut Microbiota in a Group of Adults with Cystic Fibrosis,"Dietary flavonoid intakes can influence gut microbiota (GM), which in turn can affect immune function and host metabolism, both vital considerations in cystic fibrosis (CF) management. In CF, GM may be altered and link to CF respiratory events. This study explored the relationship between flavonoid intakes and GM in free-living adults with CF. Associations between the overall GM variations (unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances between pyrosequencing results of bacterial 16-ss rDNA from frozen faecal samples of sixteen CF adults) and standardised dietary flavonoid intakes (a validated flavonoid-specific food frequency questionnaire) were analysed using adonis tests. Flavonoid intakes that were significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.3 were subjected to Spearman correlation tests with standardised bacterial relative abundances (FDR < 0.3). Gallocatechin intakes (p = 0.047, q = 0.285) were associated with unweighted UniFrac distances. Intakes of apigenin (p = 0.028, q = 0.227) and kaempferol (p = 0.029, q = 0.227), and % flavonoid intake as flavones (p = 0.013, q = 0.227) and flavonols (p = 0.016, q = 0.227) (both excluding contribution of tea) were associated with weighted UniFrac distances. Among these, gallocatechin correlated with the genus Actinomyces and family Actinomycetaceae (Actinobacteria). Gallocatechin correlated negatively with class Coriobacteriia (Actinobacteria). Intakes of some flavonoids may be associated with GM variations with potential consequences for metabolism, immune function, and inflammation, which are important in CF lung disease and co-morbidity management.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Li Li"", ids = ""50703804""); list(name = ""Shawn Somerset"", ids = ""143856472"")",a801d022ea3c723eba7e1c433e6cca99122d1927; 0614fdb0b349215bc181f86bd4f85467d7b65dd8; 7d4a173ecabb7323cf5b9c22c39aca4ffddf9d96,dbc834f4861fdfa591a5b41dc112aaa1fae3bb3c; 0f52a617e56fc0b0795aadfacb0fe8e25aead0f3; 83946a09047a2643eeeec61015f7be3b6bc7e72b; d988b5783515b6601ac530d54b4db796ec690697; 51cd12f89082ae5e245718fa6855fc61a01900fc; 547136ce656465eb87dd33109de8fae8f2a5b7e4; 6f4fe4eb5aa680de9ed1e2a38ba023699f8c2d53; ce62be133614e05a8a63c39743e42a43765a5db0; e5b4bfef5ab845ff84382a12a30de593f1c47e72; eb2729e0c0add668d7ca67abf0b39e8d6d87b0a3; 2d06f805ef866f40fe86a9579bdaeedd86b70098; 1500135e4fadc4d4a3f38b3391f5342cef7a7d3d; 0a1144d37d5478f15bfc7797363dd029941ed26b; 02cee3c58d4eff6cff85f2478e9f61acf0529768; bc85dd0fbc15f7196935548721e7fecf813cf33e; aabb0722f0adda8d79f00c2353fec49b92343d33; 9e9c7eea95d9d2cd61c2f6559009175549cf46f0; 2f7c2d410270940416fc8b73bc138c62267de1ab; 087ef4b8afe7e56eb8cec16eabd7dd23d34b0942; 40c29572729da6875f624807e091be5795a93250; cfdae9fc3f73afac40c82aa38993c45646ed9585; 0390499c1cac3007ab822414011c81c06529bde1; 3be7bb3c1f180356f2135d26ec635159e82bb9dc; b28d82ebdf643add67f9eb4ef7a6ffa10bbf0731; f12d0fff63572b13b3a30aa6ac184a24b0351e18; 9409e13ec12e7c68f306239c45de0743fe7e82d9; 70b48fd1a0c3d9fef98600578308e1e033c0c67a; 471448e1e60b948141e0a574e4db81779a8ca2ff; 6d9d40ec89bd733c147a7751ec3ec37135b6a929; 6680759f12f44f1019ce8756d4aa6e28b7a72b93; 10d9a6325e09e417775a134e0bf35730bc46c072; d6d51cfa399a8dfea230be3ebff88b6489ee3e58; c73bd8f2cf2efe2c9753d00e6b95a5d8c9312e85; acacc4fa0437d95ba72573d7ea1fc99b9b1ad94b; c7ddbd52245b088b1bf46f72e1f704ed51e352fe; 9fed746dac4a95e0c9a550da368040c3e5406f4c; 9236218efad82fe0b19891f694e09e481515bebb; 8f200b8db17cdde2db49c24605dec53347fa0c5a; 993ca9a6ac4f917ba76263861365e9cfee99dd5b; b4bdcccfa056cc1559a0dbbe217874c91ada6c91; dbf89079da283157a99161044509ced59e2236de; f7b45f82799f54a0490289a75361864b82e16780; 85bd19582dbc3f426275cdd7be98bdc1ea6a940e; fc6fc563ed5db0498a2e48d95f41c2a6f1c4cca1; a3b76522454b419e542b1d9ea21390a946cc1706; b672c7d45cf4e3f0f417f616cc82f8b4bd06d6f4; 05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe; 7d35b30bf1ecc03625de4f34b042a4be9e6abc55; a8a4059f22833c5e6250e0b6b74c0ddf8d9f9862; 0ea64fe4de06a1ea512d88c46a405e448dfd8659; 013d6d29017e4b3de5df05f540432ba3d3adc65e; e0ea1fae44cf3aa0c88b29417548445fb23a6e7d; 0da76a068b62f4e451c80846b48b527aa8b3d29b; f14161c62d8d96bd9d2a1d0e971338c43f115000; 52cd6abc2a49405f9813d2beb2f785646c52112d; 8ae20506d8e98533220a61a705dc9862d2df9dec; 0000eb3c51f87593aeecf792c57cd35a01bb32a3; 3da9c79772aab674af0df57faf06e3581198d39a; 1e2f6bdc405a2b8b934b80f9933e4a2ec3f8e960; b1e6038f0da34102688e904e0013637d5d987883; eb2641b61ca440a29b6db26ef24b6f1d9d58e50c; 3bb848689be726594f3a16feb6087b7dd6f28dfd; de1e2605fe71fd1b7c5d84ee286e9f63cd7c4e16; 539eca9a934fb90d97e5b5d2f62c2fec10206d07; 94a0dd112dca1c9ba3292a715229736867d12150; 9c50c0bd263f181d4c2ff74b99f433cc2c6b1066; 54a6d777e3a84e46f1c74bc9a0482a7307bd79c7; df9166eb16c5a1ae0478491e16eebb1795771bf2; 4c65898b4eaa62078d5906f2d0a53251687ab808,Nutrients,10,

Estimates of Ï€0 are often based on the number of p-values that exceed a threshold Î». We first give a finite sample proof for conservative point estimation of the FDR when the Î»-parameter is fixed. Then we establish a condition under which a dynamic adaptive procedure, whose Î»-parameter is determined by data, will lead to conservative Ï€0- and FDR estimators. We also present asymptotic results on simultaneous conservative FDR estimation and control for a class of dynamic adaptive procedures. Simulation results show that a novel dynamic adaptive procedure achieves more power through smaller estimation errors for Ï€0 under independence and mild dependence conditions. We conclude by discussing the connection between estimation and control of the FDR and show that several recently developed FDR control procedures can be cast in a unifying framework where the strength of the procedures can be easily evaluated.",2012,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kun Liang"", ids = ""49605072""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""48443856"")",1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 668288567719a7d837cf367ef86fc015aa03f945; e4d81c752877fc01f78485207157604e567c272d; 59babb8051daa9702332ad2db1612446f4fb7cd0; a990d6a91a7a1c0a11dafc34753b9af143c1de56; 7d85d96527ae5f719930c2239217c166b9a74049; 7de19f9df35371e467b0f6c1bf7d054799864561; 7f53895fc2915491f052d933012acc6b1d765360; c0b058aca8fa3f7bf3f3286ac8dd9a7113a8c450; 233dc0431a461df0be649dce7a1db1a619f38351; d9e2a43715b103e66d940cb52c98248bbe7d7afb; 7eccabe7c6899bf8541cd3445c281321428139f4; 58bf9433ba9a87f5629c7b2a2cb7d3982cfd81f9; b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930; c192ff5ffcb6b296c10c201d65792cf3b6119386; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; a819783cd203a543dcbc9e6c418e243019b0cb4c; e1218ceea3e1a253a212431d81d10419c798cf3c; 1ef5f9d1186763ac2c16de6615619c48fd683838; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 330b5056f383672aa1ed170e3865c1690f4a6189; 3986f3cf7642d8ab5dcf368eb8e2feca31ee3432; 706b909f078eaf3fd4ed611141a04ebbc35a018a; 9db39d3f8c26733c77dcd7cafbdd944fc667e4c3; a28c02d7128658ffa6b465230fb4c306f62e9ccc; 4610990c2ce7cddee1cd93bbbca36e5924eec0ac; 5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22,,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology,74,163-182
baf1b95fdc0f5cd517c92a1b9b282beed46a900d,Abstract 2982: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionin vitro: clinical implications for breast cancer biology,"Background: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial step in not only embryonic development but also cancer progression. From the perspective of cancer biology, EMT has been assumed to relate to the aggressiveness of cancer, which is defined by metastatic potential, and the properties of cancer stem cells. There are very few models that recapitulate EMT in vivo or in vitro. Takahashi et al. previously reported that ARPE-19 retinal pigmental epithelial cells transformed to mesenchymal cells after extrinsic stimulation with TNF-Î± and TGF-Î² in vitro. In this model, ARPE-19 cells developed cellular foci with fibronectin deposits and lost E-cadherin expression. Thus, this in vitro model was a very good representation of EMT. In the current study, using this model, we clarified the biological processes and clinical implications of EMT in breast cancer. Our objectives were to 1) understand the molecular dynamics of EMT using time-course whole-genome transcriptional profiles of this EMT model and 2) define the clinical implications on the basis of these transcriptional profiles. Methods: mRNAs were extracted from ARPE-19 cells treated with TNF-Î± and TGF-Î² and subjected to Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 arrays (GSE12548). We compared the gene expressions at four time points: 0, 6, 24, and 60 hr after treatment. For analyzing microarray data, the BRB-array tool was used. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Samples were paired by time point as follows: 0 vs 6, Phase I; 6 vs 24, Phase II; and 24 vs 60, Phase III. In each comparison, the numbers of significantly differentially expressed probes (false discovery rate Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

b157e762971757ad90acac9db0193191772d1994,A Hybrid Technique Using Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization and Random Forests for PROBE Attacks Detection in a Network,"A system connected to a network is an open choice for network intrusions unless a powerful intrusion detection or prevention system is implemented. Network security has become a serious issue due to increased unauthorized access and manipulation of network resources. Evolutionary approaches play an important role in identifying attacks with high detection rates and low false discovery rates. In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification. Empirical results show that the proposed technique outperforms well-known classification and regression techniques in most of the cases.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Arif Jamal Malik"", ids = ""2820281""); list(name = ""Farrukh Aslam Khan"", ids = ""2271400"")",f80c2968ab1c9092f1bcbcbaadf8e4d4981f8db4; 31d29b078a4181ff14e578c4b55e7d0ca04bda49; 8c63a5dff2baab905fc5c2cb37a67c77cb6032e2; 3b39cfa81fcadba933fbf0934546640fda35fd1f; 86fd2b63f46e45215d22701b2ce3102dd34e5e8b; c2f279a2cd02f88c1bee91d5dbb335f416bf298a; 9be8136ee3235e8098e902335203f8f718a6923b; b0bd57d9591c4916ca478194147416d92612e4b8,13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986; 3cf23da3fb520ab78477648e53dc3d8dbbd690a7; 397c62723436a275e169c32fb74a81384d7e2403; 8acc9cc9ff413351c66f45eeda9556e45a12ab8f; 32e31134f598e9fe4978068f696d7b2b06faee38; 60e28c7da56eb61dd8ddb710a6f079ef02668014; f94e2ff74a528330d7a95febebcb8a11c13f22fd; 30dd2516a900a15d95c94be6064130642b3f8447; 00339e89348fdda5b019591de93f0c6bf229bf4b; 56990a160eaf4d562d1ffac5c3b399fa8a79ab63; 6f1ccafe065e29b0951202168d7a256c81b25850; 9b1ff15a165d1dfc7d99072d36d8b764da03a418; 31848dc62d4eb5287461372a1fbf7b0c73f90d4b; 742021a2ee5a1b63d01811b7f75f6af93ae2136f; bdd31ee0a9d89d0bb897d8f3ff32edf7634f0798; 9041fec0e46f62d80133d36e294ebb0b1579c92c; c0b81917015a28d3eb1210743e10f6c60e728ca5; 222d8b2803f9cedf0da0b454c061c0bb46384722,"2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics",,2473-2478

For this purpose, we have combined the analysis of metabolic pathways using transcriptomics data with in situ lipid imaging obtained by desorption electrospray ionizationâ€“mass spectroscopy (DESI-MS). The transcriptome data was obtained from a previous experiment where adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) from 3 individual pigs were induced to differentiate into adipocytes for 21 days. The metabolic pathway analysis of transcriptomics data was performed using the dynamic impact approach (DIA) to determine the directional impact of pathways and gene categories. For the DESI-MS, porcine ASC were induced towards adipogenic differentiation (Monaco et al. 2009 Open Tissue Eng. Regen. Med. J. 2, 20â€“33) for 2 weeks in 24-well plates over round coverslips. Direct lipid profile of fatty acids and phospholipids in 3 different locations in undifferentiated and differentiated ASC was performed. Relative values of ion counts in each location were used for statistical analysis by means of a two-tailed t-test with unequal variance and false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The DIA uncovered amino acid and lipid metabolism as being the most affected pathways during adipogenesis. Among lipid-related pathways, the DIA indicated a strong induction during differentiation of unsaturation of fatty acids (FA) and metabolism of lipids, particularly triacylglycerol formation (TAG). The metabolism of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine was strongly induced among amino acid-related metabolism. Among the lipid molecules identified in the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 250â€“1000 by the DESI-MS, >200 had significantly (FDR 10-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively, due to adipogenic differentiation. High-resolution experiments are being performed in order to annotate more, if not all, lipid species identified in the samples by DESI-MS. The DIA indicated greater unsaturation of FA during adipogenesis, confirmed by DESI-MS, which corresponds to the characteristic increase in lipid fractions with intermediate molecular mass. This can be considered a signature of adipogenesis in porcine ASC and essential for TAG formation. The DESI-MS appears to be a valuable tool for rapid lipid profile of cells and with the potential to be used to identify cell differentiation.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Massimo Bionaz"", ids = ""50559748""); list(name = ""Christina Ramires Ferreira"", ids = ""1848901""); list(name = ""Eugenia Monaco"", ids = ""47053632""); list(name = ""R.

bf6f08dbfca74ce382b3db0ddc3e460fa570f617,Gene expression profiling of the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin in human whole blood.,"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is involved in many complex mechanisms that act in synergy including expression and function of Fc receptors, complement activation, the cytokine network, interaction with the anti-idiotypic network and modulation of B and T cell activation. To gain insight into the early effects of IVIG on this broad range of activities at the gene level we performed DNA microarray analysis. Human whole blood was incubated in vitro for 4 h followed by extraction of RNA which was hybridized to a chip containing 8793 genes. About 75 upregulated genes and 21 downregulated genes were identified using a cut off for the false discovery rate of 5%. These genes are associated with a wide range of cellular immune functions in line with the broad mechanism of action of IVIG. A striking upregulation of a series of genes coding for chemokines was measured. This finding was confirmed at the protein level as pharmacologically relevant concentrations of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were measured in serum. Interestingly, IVIG shows a partial overlap of its gene expression program with lipopolysaccharide. Our data suggests multiple hypotheses regarding the pharmacology of IVIG that must be validated by complementary studies.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Marco Ghielmetti"", ids = ""7192610""); list(name = ""Michel Bellis"", ids = ""143861655""); list(name = ""Martin O.

d5b7899eed8c27e75bd41cb67c645c3c0cf64a38,Common breast cancer risk loci predispose to distinct tumor subtypes,"Background Genome-wide association studies have identified over 170 common breast cancer susceptibility variants, many of them with differential associations by estrogen receptor (ER). How these variants are related to other tumor features is unclear. Methods Analyses included 106,571 invasive breast cancer cases and 95,762 controls of European ancestry with data on 178 genotyped or imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We used two-stage polytomous logistic regression models to evaluate SNPs in relation to multiple tumor features (ER, progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and grade) adjusting for each other, and to intrinsic-like subtypes. Results Nearly half of the SNPs (85 of 178) were associated with at least one tumor feature (false discovery rate <5%). Case-case comparisons identified ER and grade as the most common heterogeneity sources, followed by PR and HER2. Case-control comparisons among these 85 SNPs with intrinsic-like subtypes identified 65 SNPs strongly or exclusively associated at P<0.05 with luminal-like subtypes, 5 SNPs associated with all subtypes at differing strengths, and 15 SNPs primarily associated with non-luminal tumors, especially triple-negative (TN) disease. The I157T CHEK2 variant (rs17879961) was associated in opposite directions with luminal A-like (odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval (CI))=1.44 (1.31 to 1.59); P=9.26Ã—10âˆ’14) and TN (OR (95% CI)=0.61 (0.47 to 0.80); P=2.55Ã—10âˆ’4). Conclusion About half of the breast cancer susceptibility loci discovered in overall and ER-specific risk analyses have differential associations with clinical tumor features.

e05ceb23f539ff69892d91e57cb8b2e6a74e9fa0,Empirical extensions of the lasso penalty to reduce the false discovery rate in high-dimensional Cox regression models.,"Correct selection of prognostic biomarkers among multiple candidates is becoming increasingly challenging as the dimensionality of biological data becomes higher. Therefore, minimizing the false discovery rate (FDR) is of primary importance, while a low false negative rate (FNR) is a complementary measure. The lasso is a popular selection method in Cox regression, but its results depend heavily on the penalty parameter Î». Usually, Î» is chosen using maximum cross-validated log-likelihood (max-cvl). However, this method has often a very high FDR. We review methods for a more conservative choice of Î». We propose an empirical extension of the cvl by adding a penalization term, which trades off between the goodness-of-fit and the parsimony of the model, leading to the selection of fewer biomarkers and, as we show, to the reduction of the FDR without large increase in FNR. We conducted a simulation study considering null and moderately sparse alternative scenarios and compared our approach with the standard lasso and 10 other competitors: Akaike information criterion (AIC), corrected AIC, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), extended BIC, Hannan and Quinn information criterion (HQIC), risk information criterion (RIC), one-standard-error rule, adaptive lasso, stability selection, and percentile lasso. Our extension achieved the best compromise across all the scenarios between a reduction of the FDR and a limited raise of the FNR, followed by the AIC, the RIC, and the adaptive lasso, which performed well in some settings. We illustrate the methods using gene expression data of 523 breast cancer patients. In conclusion, we propose to apply our extension to the lasso whenever a stringent FDR with a limited FNR is targeted.

2cae13484a16ea6c5473d5824ce694e17d956686,NeuCode Labeling in Nematodes: Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Impact of Ascaroside Treatment in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism for biomedical research. We previously described NeuCode stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), a method for accurate proteome quantification with potential for multiplexing beyond the limits of traditional stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. Here we apply NeuCode SILAC to profile the proteomic and phosphoproteomic response of C. elegans to two potent members of the ascaroside family of nematode pheromones. By consuming labeled E. coli as part of their diet, C. elegans nematodes quickly and easily incorporate the NeuCode heavy lysine isotopologues by the young adult stage. Using this approach, we report, at high confidence, one of the largest proteomic and phosphoproteomic data sets to date in C. elegans: 6596 proteins at a false discovery rate â‰¤ 1% and 6620 phosphorylation isoforms with localization probability â‰¥75%. Our data reveal a post-translational signature of pheromone sensing that includes many conserved proteins implicated in longevity and response to stress.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy W.

c5227af7d07a1ffb4a5ff1fd26ed20de97447116,De novo detection of differentially bound regions for ChIP-seq data using peaks and windows: controlling error rates correctly,"A common aim in ChIP-seq experiments is to identify changes in protein binding patterns between conditions, i.e. differential binding. A number of peak- and window-based strategies have been developed to detect differential binding when the regions of interest are not known in advance. However, careful consideration of error control is needed when applying these methods. Peak-based approaches use the same data set to define peaks and to detect differential binding. Done improperly, this can result in loss of type I error control. For window-based methods, controlling the false discovery rate over all detected windows does not guarantee control across all detected regions. Misinterpreting the former as the latter can result in unexpected liberalness. Here, several solutions are presented to maintain error control for these de novo counting strategies. For peak-based methods, peak calling should be performed on pooled libraries prior to the statistical analysis. For window-based methods, a hybrid approach using Simes' method is proposed to maintain control of the false discovery rate across regions. More generally, the relative advantages of peak- and window-based strategies are explored using a range of simulated and real data sets.

69f5fd6e69718a5ad3d4762bccd5a39d5bfa7504,Multiple signal detection using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure,"We treat the detection problem for multiple signals embedded in noisy observations from a sensor array as a multiple hypothesis test based on log-likelihood ratios. To control the global level of the multiple test, we apply the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. The power of this multiple test has been investigated through narrow band simulations in previous studies. Here we extend the proposed method to broadband signals. Unlike the narrow band case where the test statistics are characterized by F-distribution, in the broadband case the test statistics have no closed form distribution function. We apply the bootstrap technique to overcome this difficulty. Simulations show that the FDR-controlling procedure always provides more powerful results than the FWE controlling procedure. Furthermore, the reliability of the proposed test is not affected by the gain in power",2005,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Pei-Jung Chung"", ids = ""47300580""); list(name = ""J.

35298626a71b2d205b80e8e6fc1ab14a305c7af4,Wavelet-based approaches for multiple hypothesis testing in activation mapping of functional magnetic resonance images of the human brain,"Wavelet-based methods for multiple hypothesis testing are described and their potential for activation mapping of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is investigated. In this approach, we emphasize convergence between methods of wavelet thresholding or shrinkage and the problem of multiple hypothesis testing in both classical and Bayesian contexts. Specifically, our interest will be focused on ensuring a trade off between type I probability error control and power dissipation. We describe a technique for controlling the false discovery rate at an arbitrary level of type 1 error in testing multiple wavelet coefficients generated by a 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of spatial maps of {fMRI} time series statistics. We also describe and apply recursive testing methods that can be used to define a threshold unique to each level and orientation of the 2D-DWT. Bayesian methods, incorporating a formal model for the anticipated sparseness of wavelet coefficients representing the signal or true image, are also tractable. These methods are comparatively evaluated by analysis of ""null"" images (acquired with the subject at rest), in which case the number of positive tests should be exactly as predicted under the hull hypothesis, and an experimental dataset acquired from 5 normal volunteers during an event-related finger movement task. We show that all three wavelet-based methods of multiple hypothesis testing have good type 1 error control (the FDR method being most conservative) and generate plausible brain activation maps.",2003,Mathematics; Engineering,"list(name = ""Jalal M.

8fd6a9d37288275efc8b52bb201ffa728b801b36,Chromosome 20p11 gains are associated with liver-specific metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer.,"OBJECTIVE
Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) cells have a selective preference for certain target organs that cannot be explained by circulatory patterns alone. This study aimed to identify clinicopathological features and chromosomal aberrations of primary tumours associated with organ-specific CRC metastasis.


DESIGN
Clinicopathological features were investigated in patients with CRC who had exclusively hepatic (n=182) versus exclusively extrahepatic (n=139) metastases. A total of 139 primary tumours of patients with hepatic (n=85) and extrahepatic metastases (n=54) were screened for chromosomal aberrations by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation, and the findings were validated in an independent set of 80 primary tumours. A publicly available database was used to correlate chromosomal aberrations with gene expression. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays.


RESULTS
Patients with hepatic metastases were significantly more often male (71% vs 53% p=0.002), more often had abnormal lactate dehydrogenase activity (37% vs 14% p<0.0001), exhibited primary tumour localisation in the colon (52% vs 40% p=0.03) and had synchronous onset of metastases (70% vs 19% p<0.0001). Primary tumours of patients with hepatic metastases were more commonly T3 tumours (79% vs 63% p=0.006) and less commonly of mucinous histology (5% vs 16% p=0.02). Gain of 20p11 was more often observed in patients with hepatic metastases (p<0.05), which was confirmed in an independent dataset (p<0.05; false discovery rate <0.05). Twelve genes mapping at 20p11 were significantly overexpressed as a consequence of 20p11 copy number gain. C20orf3 showed the strongest correlation between RNA expression and DNA copy number. This was reflected in significantly higher protein expression in patients with hepatic metastases (59%; n=325) than in those with extrahepatic metastases (41%; n=256) (p=0.01).


CONCLUSION
C20orf3 mapping at 20p11 is associated with hepatic-specific metastasis in patients with CRC.

a5ec90bf3507c6b53b4f1fed71f8d52c9c5d9c5a,Association between the zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene and the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder across diagnostic boundaries,"OBJECTIVES
In this study, we aimed to determine the role of genetic variations within the zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene, a candidate for a psychosis risk-conferring gene, in the development of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) in the Korean population.


METHODS
A total of 921 patients with SZ, bipolar I (BP-I) and II (BP-II) disorder, and 502 control subjects participated in the study. Twenty-one tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genomic region of ZNF804A and seven reference SNPs based on previous reports were genotyped. We applied logistic regression analyses under additive, dominant and recessive models.


RESULTS
Fifteen of the 28 SNPs showed a nominally significant association with at least one diagnostic group. However, none of these associations remained significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. As the trend of association was observed mostly in SZ and BP-I with similar patterns, we performed a post hoc analysis for the combined SZ and BP-I group. Five SNPs (rs2369595, rs6755404, rs10931156, rs12476147 and rs1366842) showed a significant association with an FDR-corrected P of <.05.


CONCLUSIONS
This study supports a possible role of ZNF804A in the common susceptibility of major psychoses, and identified additional candidate variants of the gene in the Korean population.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ji Hyun Baek"", ids = ""4983259""); list(name = ""Kyooseob Ha"", ids = ""39783947""); list(name = ""Yongkang Kim"", ids = ""3198729""); list(name = ""So Yung Yang"", ids = ""6497171""); list(name = ""Eun-young Cho"", ids = ""39275514""); list(name = ""Yujin Choi"", ids = ""7452736""); list(name = ""Seunghyong Ryu"", ids = ""6947743""); list(name = ""Yu-Sang Lee"", ids = ""119814521""); list(name = ""Taesung Park"", ids = ""144903092""); list(name = ""Kyung Sue Hong"", ids = ""2694310"")",e4eb65bc983af7700a61d0fcf732414d1a62490b,c0bdb69846cd9930921692c18ebace40c0415253; e1f6072363836f65bf8ea300456d0aea00a22f27; f5465c262da5b489c65f88b0e405a67fe20c715b; 4659b0458d29305359d3ad78533149a86ffb5fcd; c2019e9735d3c8fc201ff32d2c8f3d3193e6ff3e; d515820b03d569e0859971f15fd09cdef5a7c350; 50a42ed2f81b9fe150883a6c89194c88a9647106; dd1b3a3793619cec8994cc7cca10e6dee656fb7b; 9f364f98963a09cb5349909a00432b180f14e34f; 5cccb6bb25e8489a9ec05127492be48c0dfbdfb3; 8c79b3f46fb2145ab92826fbb09526836b7328c3; 4c72fa56ff45d2a64e3273cf58f9304a63f7a5f8; b6a6a6ab957f307c73a1afe33fa9907ce61f6f44; 43609d1591837e3ca43a0a86ebe993b82b1e9520; 9c8b255b06e8cc9eaafc4cc6b085f188438dbd43; 73003fec285fbde6423f86880e0095ee13f12a16; 4ce5d2c06e8ad696a44a7111fc25cdd57c2e773f; 03c61f776ba6a1c9ca51de16b5077dda652e10cf; 40e3ce40c806ad6c5564e5319fe58be3f14fb79a; 189533b77b665958ef83a76357accb0894572644; b2984a9afdab86a71e2c43b8f0a4272a9f0019ed; ed5b7e5c6fea3eb68223a394302a39adac832f6b; c85cab9b4cd0382821e56e53ba83e5c759483097; 96cc60b75445310d362973fd7919a68d2dffd648; 5160cd6042e9996050cde1bbb0ed8a633f40d901; 57626d8dbe5e3bf8f5a8d2d906382bffa3c37b77; 5524853fbe9dd618b22c3076775f9fc96554658b; 756e6b4ce3fac95a2c7c04bd88a776bec5a979dc; f23d7a4225153034d1eae96b628a3f7d06c656d0; e4f8bc05a2667e1dfcb4484620492b7a6bb63b08; 73d40b20e41b9989f974da45bbbd32d7137fcdb5; 1e625daaf71c47fcd22a579bbadc225f65547fd9; 00cd59ecbbfe6ee886d785b1ab0f6576ed1bca1e; f677a6b0cdd847b6f3f23db1a40b6c0c1c048cec; 91a1fd5433d682aecaf2b4d6efd877aa6497f0a6; 8c17b895397e9d7be0eb56a22a0d02f236443a35; 0192de8f255f82a521ee9639abdc4fe3e945e794; 389b39cca7f5fa2cb369f2561d14100ced2aa5ba; ea02cd8a7d63b4ecddd49d8228e80b89cb5ed68f; 86a87f4a06ec78d87936a810b41e7b6b60a96940; 3dfbe6b976480c5c02cb0b4995df46d5f35d7b46; 54f00a317e9cb3a788f64215bc08a4d56b1c0f3d; 1548a9215ac00b9f9c5e99ef33163a9bb44dcb14; 270c9c8075ca0dee2c73d8235cf27afbb4b2beae; 1a97785e71bc311d5267924aee3b6179b881a251; e5fb6f06ef9feea9ed99e57d8ab1fefad86f309c; ae5b437ceb8a33eb36754d2502fa3735f220bdd6; e710c3f52fe189297c71601dcc13244f44f6b9a6,Bipolar Disorders,19,305â€“313
9f654a6194bd73767f19fc694e8e913b1ad5fbd8,Matching cross-linked peptide spectra: only as good as the worse identification.,"Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry identifies interacting surfaces within a protein assembly through labeling with bifunctional reagents and identifying the covalently modified peptides. These yield distance constraints that provide a powerful means to model the three-dimensional structure of the assembly. Bioinformatic analysis of cross-linked data resulting from large protein assemblies is challenging because each cross-linked product contains two covalently linked peptides, each of which must be correctly identified from a complex matrix of potential confounders. Protein Prospector addresses these issues through a complementary mass modification strategy in which each peptide is searched and identified separately. We demonstrate this strategy with an analysis of RNA polymerase II. False discovery rates (FDRs) are assessed via comparison of cross-linking data to crystal structure, as well as by using a decoy database strategy. Parameters that are most useful for positive identification of cross-linked spectra are explored. We find that fragmentation spectra generally contain more product ions from one of the two peptides constituting the cross-link. Hence, metrics reflecting the quality of the spectral match to the less confident peptide provide the most discriminatory power between correct and incorrect matches. A support vector machine model was built to further improve classification of cross-linked peptide hits. Furthermore, the frequency with which peptides cross-linked via common acylating reagents fragment to produce diagnostic, cross-linker-specific ions is assessed. The threshold for successful identification of the cross-linked peptide product depends upon the complexity of the sample under investigation. Protein Prospector, by focusing the reliability assessment on the least confident peptide, is better able to control the FDR for results as larger complexes and databases are analyzed. In addition, when FDR thresholds are calculated separately for intraprotein and interprotein results, a further improvement in the number of unique cross-links confidently identified is achieved. These improvements are demonstrated on two previously published cross-linking datasets.",2014,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael J.

Complications such as stricture and fistula and characteristics such as TNF-antagonist responsiveness have been suggested as discreet mechanistic CD subtypes. This study explored the ability of genome wide expression profiling in whole blood to differentiate CD sub-populations. Methods: In the previously reported Phase 2b ustekinumab CERTIFI study of patients with moderate to severely active CDwho had failed or were intolerant to TNF-antagonists, whole blood samples were collected from a subset for mRNA expression profiling using Affymetrix HG-U133+ PM arrays. Baseline expression profiles were compared between patient sub-groups characterized by defined baseline disease attributes; and compared with those from samples obtained independently from healthy subjects. Expression modulations of .+/-1.5x and false discovery rate (FDR) p-value , 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Patients (n=204) with moderate to severe CD had significant expression modulations in 1725 transcripts in the whole blood compared with healthy subjects (n=49), including genes involved in inflammatory response and connective tissue disorders. A panel of 20 transcripts (including GAB2 and IL18R1) discriminated patients with only colonic (n=49) vs. strictly ileal (n=60) disease involvement. Significantly different expression modulations of 169, 321, and 151 transcripts, respectively, were identified in patients with high baseline CRP ( â‰¥10 mg/dL, n=97), fecal calprotectin (â‰¥850 mg/g, n=80) or lactoferrin (. 100 mg/g, n=89) compared with patients with low baseline CRP ( â‰¤3 mg/dL, n=45), fecal calprotectin (â‰¤250 mg/g, n=58), or lactoferrin (â‰¤100 mg/g, n=107). As expected, patients with high baseline CRP, fecal calprotectin, or lactoferrin had elevated gene expressions in inflammatory pathways such as IL-6 and acute phase response signaling. In contrast, gene expression profiles did not differentiate between patients with different durations of disease (long [â‰¥15yrs] vs. short [â‰¤5yrs]); prior treatment response (Primary responder vs. non-responder) and treatment history (number of TNFs failed); and the presence or absence of complications (stricture/stenosis, fistula). Conclusion: Genomewide expression profiling of peripheral blood samples provides the understanding of CD at the molecular level in circulation.

01ddc2dc19418099c237a47c766a4eaebc3a876c,Transcriptome Characterization by RNA-seq Unravels the Mechanisms of Butyrate-Induced Epigenomic Regulation in Bovine Cells,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, affect cell differentiation, proliferation, and motility. Butyrate also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through its inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). In addition, butyrate is a potent inducer of histone hyper-acetylation in cells. Therefore, this SCFA provides an excellent in vitro model for studying the epigenomic regulation of gene expression induced by histone acetylation. In this study, we analyzed the differential in vitro expression of genes induced by butyrate in bovine epithelial cells by using deep RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq). The number of sequences read, ranging from 57,303,693 to 78,933,744, were generated per sample. Approximately 11,408 genes were significantly impacted by butyrate, with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. The predominant cellular processes affected by butyrate included cell morphological changes, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Our results provided insight into the transcriptome alterations induced by butyrate, which will undoubtedly facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying butyrate-induced epigenomic regulation in bovine cells.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sitao Wu"", ids = ""47403614""); list(name = ""Robert W.

0bc3f2595cc3b6f5aec7efc5f738bd1c882d592e,The difficulty of a fair comparison,"Comparing methods in a fair and informative manner is often not straightforward. Benchmark data sets, thoughtfully applied metrics and clear reporting can help. comparisons, or report which version of previous software was used for computational ones. Studies expressly designed for methods comparison are a more rigorous solution to the problem. These are often the result of community-wide competitions (Nat. Methods 11, 695, 2014), with the compared methods implemented by expert users on a common data set. Other studies test intra-and interlaboratory variability by treating the same sample with variations on the same overall methodologyâ€” stem cell culture methods, for example, or analysis of protein complexes with affinity purificationâ€“mass spectrom-etry. We continue to encourage systematic comparisons of methods and tools and to consider them for publication in the Analysis format (Nat. Methods 9, 111, 2012). Though systematic methods evaluation remains the exception rather than the rule, community-approved benchmarks can be tremendously useful even outside the confines of such a study. For proper methods comparison, typically needed are both reference data sets to which any relevant method can be applied and quantitative measures of performance. Such benchmarks have been developed in some fields. High-throughput methods to identify protein-protein interactions, for example, are now widely assessed using literature-curated reference data sets together with statistical performance measures. For genomic analysis tools of various types, simulated data with known properties constitute useful benchmarks, though these cannot entirely replace performance tests on experimental data. As for metrics to quantify a method's performance, these can take the form of common statistical measures such as the false discovery rate or metrics designed specifically for a particular application. For example, in stem cell culture and differentiationâ€”an area in which methods are bedeviled by variabilityâ€”gene expressionâ€“based scores to define pluripotency or differentiation help to quantitatively assess a method's performance vis-Ã -vis other available options. What constitutes a good benchmark will obviously vary depending on the methods being compared and the biological applications in question. The definition of such benchmarks should be an ongoing discussion in every field. Though the ultimate test of a method's power is how it performs 'in the wild' , standards that any scientist can use to test a (new or existing) method will promote repro-ducibility and help researchers decide which methods are worth an investment of their money, energy and time.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanism of PDAC and identify biologically active small molecules capable of targeting the sub-pathways which were dysregulated in the development of PDAC.


METHODS
The gene expression profile of GSE28735 microarray data (including 45 matching pairs of pancreatic tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues) was downloaded from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues were identified, and then the sub-pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Moreover, an approach based on targeting sub-pathways was used to reveal potential agents for PDAC.


RESULTS
A total of 5315 DEGs were identified between pancreatic tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues with a false discovery rate of 0.01. Genes of collagen family and integrin receptor family which were involved in pathways of focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction respectively were differentially expressed in the pancreatic tumor tissue. Besides, a total of 85 small molecules including fludrocortisone, latamoxef and metronidazole were revealed by bioinformatics analysis.


CONCLUSION
This study proposed the use of an approach based on targeting sub-pathways to identify potential agents for PDAC. The sub-pathways and small molecules discovered in this study were not only related to PDAC but also play a role in perturbing the development of PDAC.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yue Lin"", ids = ""49416353""); list(name = ""Yu Jin"", ids = ""145428207""); list(name = ""Lian-jie Lin"", ids = ""6660531""); list(name = ""Yong Cao"", ids = ""144711445""); list(name = ""Ying Zhang"", ids = ""40600347""); list(name = ""Shao-Fu Chen"", ids = ""47336038""); list(name = ""Chang-qing Zheng"", ids = ""34679588"")",6e1bf613e816e493ce3ddfe3683398a077906577,,Gene,540 2,"

The false discovery rate (FDR) multiple-comparisons procedure can be used to determine statistical significance. When the test statistics have discrete distributions, the FDR procedure can be made more powerful by a simple modification. The paper develops a modified FDR procedure for discrete data and applies it to the human immunodeficiency virus data. The new procedure detects 15 positions with significantly different mutation rates compared with 11 that are detected by the original FDR method.

85476c6a7f8d91ed88cb05b24a13cd674db5b7dd,The rapamycin-regulated gene expression signature determines prognosis for breast cancer,"BackgroundMammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways promoting tumor growth. mTOR is aberrantly activated in a significant portion of breast cancers and is a promising target for treatment. Rapamycin and its analogues are in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment. Patterns of gene expression (metagenes) may also be used to simulate a biologic process or effects of a drug treatment. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the gene-expression signature regulated by rapamycin could predict disease outcome for patients with breast cancer.ResultsColony formation and sulforhodamine B (IC50 < 1 nM) assays, and xenograft animals showed that MDA-MB-468 cells were sensitive to treatment with rapamycin. The comparison of in vitro and in vivo gene expression data identified a signature, termed rapamycin metagene index (RMI), of 31 genes upregulated by rapamycin treatment in vitro as well as in vivo (false discovery rate of 10%). In the Miller dataset, RMI did not correlate with tumor size or lymph node status. High (>75th percentile) RMI was significantly associated with longer survival (P = 0.015). On multivariate analysis, RMI (P = 0.029), tumor size (P = 0.015) and lymph node status (P = 0.001) were prognostic. In van 't Veer study, RMI was not associated with the time to develop distant metastasis (P = 0.41). In the Wang dataset, RMI predicted time to disease relapse (P = 0.009).ConclusionRapamycin-regulated gene expression signature predicts clinical outcome in breast cancer. This supports the central role of mTOR signaling in breast cancer biology and provides further impetus to pursue mTOR-targeted therapies for breast cancer treatment.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""A Akcakanat"", ids = ""6046757""); list(name = ""Li Zhang"", ids = ""2029335""); list(name = ""Spiridon Tsavachidis"", ids = ""6573098""); list(name = ""Funda Meric-Bernstam"", ids = ""1397965147"")",7b8c911be27f577668f9e82d507eed5b0fbb2435; 029a9ff9d26f4b6edf4fdbe31f870f30c8ed3148; bb5fe4e501828953ee4ca54483a93c8e5773c865; 0d55ccbb19c5324f81d9643eef06a44d3663d192; b999e4b50f34d80acc113e62a5d831e26631ca0d; d6734d28a9bbdacf89f1e625a54252a031e82ab1; 68b9e395fe32e874edb019ca4dbf34c27fad5385; ca884e2dc37d0a46b6f73f7577ea49451c7d809e; bd6e122a5a270ee74f1639c8abd8023c4b30d77a; 2947be4b90e43c245308ad183c8a50bd7e0d7da4; e6570e56e7bbde582179788c1043795678bc8526; 9e3400a09d32a29cdcb8d62c0ca7f34b2e35dc3c; 2732c6a8fa3ea8bd8a7cb99092e42117870c3a52; 53c3b97f8969e5a813232cf5f1063a28bbce03e6; c6cac5980f6ef50ae097fee7aaefd087f4a8621a; 5d19165d6c48bfe7a28e2bcad0c967a992427156,543b6d8c46e5832cae6bbc8c8c76356d55d9d89d; cb40bfc20a348ad41396e472a0838e221aa70bf3; 5224e45c49ebb756d3c1d18682a1e02b8cb18348; efe9121f4417d60b3377e8aba67daff983f9c521; 1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339; b34ab71798f173b3786243c3929b244bb0b20066; 80393d5e4db21bc7c2b29c77b0964c41507cfbfa; 26887a17ef00fc2a6b58d931b821c48d5160f4a1; be35efe232f6c79b8861e43d235326db7a31a29f; 62a5fff5a5e96b2982c89313f92867d7bfb98cbe; 036d2fbcc9d6ab5233b17e6a94bc91568e7a2235; b2f0af457778607824ada4e26fedea245c76342f; d5251a6a56190be7426b0d6a42808a9b7db4b80a; 09037900cd9fc0e7e0d89591eb47806ef0be2f40; 251e40a3502ff24f7b1ccdba4d8e50f7b3472727; f1b77c01f3afcdcdcafe770da9e374f90e4421fe; d319623837ea96a1dbbdcab8874391c41790bff6; c0c724b4abbb17fb6d9061bb2febfe611f6a88cc; 3e85d232b3251429cf257680100467f416e24092; 8c509abf8ac08f639fb3565edc7d498caf3eefd3; adeaa71d628bcb09dc70c3fdea47819fedde3a6b; e938bfd2ffe4d1a93cdbe77cb7b076b0770add6d; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 1fccf1f4874c1d6e50eef1196ea739182e065a34; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 579b581039957ce7d30f115da1b6662be6eb3ec4; 1d77f967440bdb6c1f908f8a78cebf5dbd41a808; ce6c71c0a88eb4b41a98ed960418bdb108b250d5; bd2478e00ff9d35dab9fedbb6b68717371f3196a; 29f7d979ef289741041d10d88a2dee8be3a4e64d; 2b69625553b8004e67fb8e618ca7689aacd37340; 314a2441405c70e3b77795ecfc4340d69b701d1e; e78fa2b5fe9c7929bad93d3f0b8311c602242f75; d08a0a93495825eee0a1343410cd3acebeae89e3; 1788fde048bf35874be9f6e5b9036f2ee9936b87; 7e9f55eda2846d8bec62086842d1446d41f4f9c1; 6e6da621f0200daa484c5b6ada9e3debf1c369af; fc5a21fb9045ba782049f266014c1abbaf5b3011; bb97d48925ff5c83175c1127bbe60af1c3e91141; 2a0bf30dc789b2f9aa9f1078cff496afe54134e2; 8573bbb55112c1f06c43211daedacc1578e69a92; cce5f277ab6fed219845f56fe5fa55e6b144a583; 1504185446546eb4859a712053d970e850424259; c8ab2dddf63bea242ddf0c441812eaf76297fff4; e9b911316ca0cbeb8b3a3ffc230363c3e97427cf; 99738ed472222422ea05dd61fadade6b9fd4b658; f02df232cb920ae98c26dfa5e3d8261ee9397ff5; 5b583b338ae0e84f99e8cdf3a40ddcb5396d2af1,Molecular Cancer,8,75 - 75

We tested for trait loci associated with body weight, height, and bison mass index (BMI) while controlling for estimated ancestry to reduce potential confounding effects due to population admixture in 1316 bison sampled from four U.S. herds. We used 60 microsatellite markers to model each phenotype as a function of herd, sex, age, marker genotypes, and individual ancestry estimates. Statistical significance for genotype and its interaction with ancestry was evaluated using the adaptive false discovery rate. Of the four herds, two appeared to be admixed and two were nonadmixed. Although none of the main effects of the loci were significant, estimated ancestry and its interaction with marker loci were significantly associated with the phenotypes, illustrating the importance of including ancestry in the models and the dependence of genotype-phenotype associations on background ancestry. Individual loci contributed approximately 2.0% of variation in weight, height, and BMI, which confirms the utility and potential importance of adjusting for population stratification.",2006,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Solomon K.

The main objective of this study was to examine the applicability of multivariate association mapping with an empirical data set of sugar beet. A total of 111 diploid sugar beet inbreds was selected from the seed parent heterotic pool to represent a broad diversity with respect to sugar content (SC). The inbreds were genotyped with 26 simple sequence repeat markers chosen according to their map positions in proximity to previously identified quantitative trait loci for SC. For SC and beet yield (BY), the genotypic variances were highly significant (PÂ <Â 0.01). Based on the global test of the bivariate mixed-model approach, four markers were significantly associated with SC, BY, or both at a false discovery rate of 0.025. All four markers were significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) associated with BY but only two with SC.

c70305eee70f9719c181e1277affaa419009f5e6,Association between Helicobacter pylori and mortality in the NHANES III study.,"OBJECTIVE
Persistent colonisation by Helicobacter pylori, and especially by cagA-positive strains, has been related to several health outcomes with effects in opposite directions. Thus, it is important to evaluate its influence on total and category-specific mortality.


DESIGN
We conducted prospective cohort analyses in a nationally representative sample of 9895 participants enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III to assess the association of H pylori status with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Analyses for the association of H pylori cagA positivity with mortality were conducted in 7384 subjects with data on H pylori cagA status.


RESULTS
In older people (> 40.1 years), H pylori was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18). There was an inverse association of H pylori status with stroke mortality (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.08), and the inverse association was stronger for H pylori cagA positivity, with the HR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.76). H pylori was also strongly positively related to gastric cancer mortality. After we adjusted p values using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method to account for multiple comparisons, these associations remained, and H pylori status was not related to other outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that H pylori has a mixed role in human health, but is not a major risk factor for all-cause mortality.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yu Li Chen"", ids = ""50579888""); list(name = ""Stephanie Segers"", ids = ""6047860""); list(name = ""Martin J.

3922933d86981c34c8b87f4e425bade2ea942904,Gene network approach reveals co-expression patterns in nasal and bronchial epithelium,"Nasal gene expression profiling is a new approach to investigate the airway epithelium as a biomarker to study the activity and treatment responses of obstructive pulmonary diseases. We investigated to what extent gene expression profiling of nasal brushings is similar to that of bronchial brushings. We performed genome wide gene expression profiling on matched nasal and bronchial epithelial brushes from 77 respiratory healthy individuals. To investigate differences and similarities among regulatory modules, network analysis was performed on correlated, differentially expressed and smoking-related genes using Gaussian Graphical Models. Between nasal and bronchial brushes, 619 genes were correlated and 1692 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05, |Fold-change|>2). Network analysis of correlated genes showed pro-inflammatory pathways to be similar between the two locations.

8a942468c346ed9fac9e52606b2a03bc3458e54a,[Correlation between blood pressure and DNA methylation in adult twins].,"OBJECTIVE
To explore the DNA methylation sites correlated with blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure) in adult twin population.


METHODS
A total of 476 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry were selected as the research population. Questionnaires were used to collect demographic characteristics, lifestyle, disease status and other information, and blood pressure, height, weight and other anthropometric indicators were measured. The genome-wide DNA methylation of whole blood samples was detected by using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. The DNA methylation sites correlated with blood pressure were analyzed by constructing mixed effect model with adjusting potential confounding factors, and the significant level was false discovery rate <0.05.


RESULTS
After data quality control, 465 twins (122 pairs of monozygotic twins, 104 pairs of dizygotic twins, 13 individuals from 13 pairs of twins) aged (44.8Â±13.2) years were finally enrolled. There were more males and more monozygotic twins, and the current smokers and current regular drinkers both accounted for more than 30%. No significant CpG site was found after multiple testing in the correlation study between genome-wide DNA methylation and blood pressure by using the collected twins. However, the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 had low P value in the correlation analysis of 3 blood pressure indices (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure), suggesting that this site might be correlated with blood pressure. The other 7 sites had low P value in the correlation analysis of the two blood pressure indices, respectively, which pointed to genes involved in neurological development, protein homeostasis, inflammatory reaction and other pathways.


CONCLUSION
There is no sufficient evidence to support any DNA methylation site correlated with blood pressure, which may be caused by insufficient sample size and other reasons. This study could provide a reference for subsequent similar twin studies, and subsequent studies can focus on the cg07761116 located on chromosome 10 and other sites with low P values.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zhi-jun Wu"", ids = ""48551531""); list(name = ""Wenjing Gao"", ids = ""35636851""); list(name = ""Biqi Wang"", ids = ""4255612""); list(name = ""Weihua Cao"", ids = ""2575301""); list(name = ""J Lv"", ids = ""4358129""); list(name = ""Canqing Yu"", ids = ""144347315""); list(name = ""Zengchang Pang"", ids = ""6517138""); list(name = ""L M Cong"", ids = ""49587916""); list(name = ""H Wang"", ids = ""11445114""); list(name = ""Xian Wu"", ids = ""50857257""); list(name = ""Li-ming Li"", ids = ""35838646"")",,,Beijing da xue xue bao.

Our objective was to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in adult Saudis and investigate possible association with lifestyle and dietary practices. Feces from 104 Saudi volunteers (48% males) were tested for microbiota by sequencing the V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). For all participants, data were collected related to their lifestyle habits and dietary practices. The relative abundance (RA) of Fusobacteria was significantly higher in normal weight Saudis (P = 0.005, false discovery rate-FDR = 0.014). Individuals who consumed more coffee presented marginally significant more RA of Fusobacteria (P = 0.02, FDR = 0.20) in their gut microbiota compared to those reporting low or no coffee intake, but the RA of Fusobacteria was significantly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers (P = 0.009, FDR = 0.027). The RA of Fusobacteria was also significantly higher in those reporting daily consumption of bread (P = 0.005, FDR = 0.015). At the species level, the gut microbiota of people who consumed coffee was dominated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron followed by Phascolarctobacterium faecium and Eubacterium rectale. Similarly, the gut microbiota of smokers was also enriched by B. thetaiotaomicron and Lactobacillus amylovorus. Smoking cessation, bread and coffee consumption induce changes in the intestinal microbial composition of Saudis. This indicates the significance of diet and lifestyle practices in the determination of the composition of the gut microbiota, which could possibly lead later to changes in metabolic profile and weight.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Steve M Harakeh"", ids = ""4868415""); list(name = ""Emmanouil Angelakis"", ids = ""13311419""); list(name = ""Timokratis Karamitros"", ids = ""5318141""); list(name = ""Dipankar Bachar"", ids = ""145224221""); list(name = ""Suhad Bahijri"", ids = ""4955785""); list(name = ""Ghada M Ajabnoor"", ids = ""5108349""); list(name = ""Sulaiman Mohammed Alfadul"", ids = ""6100661""); list(name = ""Suha Abdulall Farraj"", ids = ""6828924""); list(name = ""Turki Al Amri"", ids = ""1481723568""); list(name = ""Ahmed M.

85c21b3c515d111dbf41c8ad34050d123bbb1e42,Gene expression differences between stroke-associated and asymptomatic carotid plaques,"Atherosclerotic carotid stenosis is an important risk factor for stroke. Carotid plaques (CPs) causing stroke may present a distinct type of molecular pathology compared with transient ischemic attack (TIA)-associated or asymptomatic plaques. We compared the gene expression profiles of CPs from stroke patients (nâ€‰=â€‰12) and asymptomatic patients (nâ€‰=â€‰9), both with similar risk factors and severity of carotid stenosis (>70%). Sixty probes showed over 1.5-fold expression difference at 5% false discovery rate. Functional clustering showed enrichment of genes in 51 GO categories and seven pathways, the most significant of which relate to extracellular-matrix interaction, PPAR gamma signaling, scavanger receptor activity, and lysosomal activity. Differential expression of ten genes was confirmed in an extended replication group (nâ€‰=â€‰43), where the most significant expression differences were found in CD36 (2.1-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.005), CD163 (1.7-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.007) and FABP4 (2.2-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.015). These include four genes not previously linked to plaque destabilization: GLUL (2.2-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.016), FUCA1 (2.2-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.025), IL1RN (1.6-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.034), and S100A8 (2.5-fold change, pâ€‰=â€‰0.047). Strong correlations were found to plaque ulceration, plaque hemorrhage, and markers of apoptosis and proliferation (activated caspase 3, TUNEL, and Ki67). Protein expression of these genes was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and was found in the atheromatous areas of CPs critical for plaque destabilization. This study presents a comprehensive transcriptional analysis of stroke-associated CPs and demonstrates a significant transcriptome difference between stroke-associated and asymptomatic CPs. Follow-up studies on the identified genes are needed to define whether they could be used as biomarkers of symptomatic CPs or have a role in plaque destabilization.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jani Saksi"", ids = ""4139982""); list(name = ""Petra IjÃ¤s"", ids = ""4864474""); list(name = ""Krista Nuotio"", ids = ""5928292""); list(name = ""Riitta Sonninen"", ids = ""5822449""); list(name = ""Lauri Soinne"", ids = ""4031679""); list(name = ""Oili Salonen"", ids = ""2240154""); list(name = ""Eija I.

2ca4c7f00275da1e994a71fc4935b7733fb3524d,Application of false discovery rate procedure to pairwise comparisons of refractive index of glass fragments.,"This study was undertaken to apply a new method of controlling type I error when performing pairwise comparisons. The Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures have proved to be very powerful tools in solving many practical problems but have not yet been applied to pairwise comparisons of refractive index of glass samples. Students t-test and Welch test (unequal variance Student's t-test) were applied to all possible pairwise comparisons. The comparisons were made on the basis of refractive index values of 72 glass fragments from different car windows and 69 different fragments from one windscreen. The type I error was controlled by the use of Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure. To illustrate the importance of controlling type I error when using pairwise comparisons, results of pairwise comparisons with the FDR controlling procedure were compared to those comparisons made without any controlling procedure. Significantly fewer false negative results (false rejection of H0) were found during the use of FDR procedure in the comparison of refractive indices from the same windscreen than when comparing without controlling type I error. The results of application of FDR method were also compared to the results of other post-hoc tests, such as Tukey HSD test and Bonfferoni test. The FDR method has higher power than Bonferroni method and Tukey HSD method and control errors better than comparing without controlling type I error. The method of choice, for pairwise comparison of glass fragments on the basis of refractive index is Welch test with FDR adjustment. The method gave type I errors at level about 5.3% and type II error at about 3.7%.",2006,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""M Pawluk-KoÅ‚c"", ids = ""1422080064""); list(name = ""Janina Zieba-Palus"", ids = ""1399022171""); list(name = ""Andrzej Parczewski"", ids = ""6185238"")",14d44a92d33fbc1ccf8870f103501c53852adafb; 9f424e938077d7a33f04d1fa99502f9b10984370; dc804bff5ba91ed3cf605f6104bbe53f34a3fd03; ae5ad019323c95cf3585f574cdcb3f934080dc02; 5dc07c48ced3408ae4dec23f78ed19787cdce53a; d78be1d2ce316dbce633190996c721d17ca428d3; 772f16e4edb79e20e3f211d9aefafaafd185950f,,Forensic science international,160 1,"

3c71dd3a837633168340e3b0dc2260201df2aa93,Identification of apolipoprotein A-II in cerebrospinal fluid of pediatric brain tumor patients by protein expression profiling.,"BACKGROUND
Our aim was to detect differences in protein expression profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from pediatric patients with and without brain tumors.


METHODS
We used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and Q10 ProteinChip arrays to compare protein expression profiles of CSF from 32 pediatric brain tumor patients and 70 pediatric control patients. A protein with high discriminatory power was isolated and identified by subsequent anion-exchange and reversed-phase fractionation, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. The identity of the protein was confirmed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Of the 247 detected protein peak clusters, 123 were differentially expressed between brain tumor and control patients with a false discovery rate of 1%. Double-loop classification analysis gave a mean prediction accuracy of 88% in discriminating brain tumor patients from control patients. From the 123 clusters, a highly overexpressed protein peak cluster in CSF from brain tumor patients was selected for further analysis and identified as apolipoprotein A-II. Apolipoprotein A-II expression in CSF was correlated with the CSF albumin concentration, suggesting that the overexpression of apolipoprotein A-II is related to a disrupted blood-brain barrier.


CONCLUSIONS
SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry can be successfully used to find differentially expressed proteins in CSF of pediatric brain tumor and control patients. Apolipoprotein A-II is highly overexpressed in CSF of pediatric brain tumor patients, which most likely is related to a disrupted blood-brain barrier.

0a187d301cef64f17d0478b183705b8054bcad3d,A two-stage online monitoring procedure for high-dimensional data streams,"Abstract Advanced computing and data acquisition technologies have made possible the collection of high-dimensional data streams in many fields. Efficient online monitoring tools that can correctly identify any abnormal data stream for such data are highly sought. However, most of the existing monitoring procedures directly apply the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure to the data at each time point, and the FDR at each time point (the pointwise FDR) is either specified by users or determined by the in-control (IC) average run length (ARL). If the pointwise FDR is specified by users, the resulting procedure lacks control of the global FDR and keeps users in the dark in terms of the IC ARL. If the pointwise FDR is determined by the IC ARL, the resulting procedure does not give users the flexibility to choose the number of false alarms (Type-I errors) they can tolerate when identifying abnormal data streams, which often makes the procedure too conservative. To address those limitations, a two-stage monitoring procedure is proposed to control both the IC-ARL and Type-I errors at the levels specified by users. As a result, the proposed procedure allows users to choose not only how often they expect any false alarms when all data streams are IC but also how many false alarms they can tolerate when identifying abnormal data streams. Due to this extra flexibility, the proposed two-stage monitoring procedure is shown to outperform the exiting methods in the simulation study and real data analysis.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jun Yu Li"", ids = ""46276037"")",164014663fa47da881e0b64cd412b537c7440d16; 14fb03c451648cefa7c62afb5f320cdba1deae48,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; a079ae87864e3d97515799c0e7df4dd1de3ab235; afc32b7905b899fcffd075b7ffd45ba1aaa46efb; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; b3e6c87e8cf7adb96c8abf35f096b283ac4b346f; a2c9fbcfa79de7d31107b8f930c1cc8e6cbed185; c886dd0828fc4829baef82e2e7337c98351af51e; 69a8ac57d1fb47e08c5da01da5bd84a8f1b3c498; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4a38772c0dddf450b01777003eb61d02e97df133; 7943980f3d381bc4bbe9fef291322e6104f3a157; c88c589cfe7aa7be9b180bb8181d7f79c0bfa556; 80cd49b2b46184eb795ee349d02c52a32d8d7df8; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; af90c9167b736ba878be25fac3fba71d61746589,Journal of Quality Technology,51,392 - 406
d15fc9eb49d0b9a58a68776526407cb3cd5d66c5,Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression in the epithelium and stroma of normal colon in healthy individuals in an aspirin intervention trial,"BackgroundRegular aspirin use reduces colon adenoma and carcinoma incidence. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are involved in aspirin metabolism and clearance, and variant alleles in UGT1A6 have been shown to alter salicylic acid metabolism and risk of colon neoplasia.MethodsIn a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of 44 healthy men and women, homozygous for UGT1A6*1 or UGT1A6*2, we explored differences between global epithelial and stromal expression, using Affymetrix U133â€‰+â€‰2.0 microarrays and tested effects of 60-day aspirin supplementation (325Â mg/d) on epithelial and stromal gene expression and colon prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels.ResultsNo statistically significant differences in gene expression were observed in response to aspirin or UGT1A6 genotype, but tissue PGE2 levels were lower with aspirin compared to placebo (p <0.001). Transcripts differentially expressed between epithelium and stroma (Nâ€‰=â€‰4916, Pâ€‰<0.01, false discovery rate <0.001), included a high proportion of genes involved in cell signaling, cellular movement, and cancer. Genes preferentially expressed in epithelium were involved in drug and xenobiotic metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, apoptosis signaling, and ion transport. Genes preferentially expressed in stroma included those involved in inflammation, cellular adhesion, and extracellular matrix production. Wnt-Tcf4 pathway genes were expressed in both epithelium and stroma but differed by subcellular location.ConclusionsThese results suggest that, in healthy individuals, subtle effects of aspirin on gene expression in normal colon tissue are likely overwhelmed by inter-individual variability in microarray analyses. Differential expression of critical genes between colonic epithelium and stroma suggest that these tissue types need to be considered separately.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sushma S.

Inheritance of a heterozygous mutation in CCM3/PDCD10 is responsible for the most aggressive familial form of the disease. Here we studied the differences and commonalities between the transcriptomes of microdissected lesional neurovascular units (NVUs) from acute and chronic in vivo Ccm3/Pdcd10ECKO mice, and cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) Ccm3/Pdcd10ECKO.We identified 2409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in acute and 2962 in chronic in vivo NVUs compared to microdissected brain capillaries, as well as 121 in in vitro BMECs with and without Ccm3/Pdcd10 loss (fold change â‰¥ |2.0|; pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, false discovery rate corrected). A functional clustered dendrogram generated using the Euclidean distance showed that the DEGs identified only in acute in vivo NVUs were clustered in cellular proliferation gene ontology functions. The DEGs only identified in chronic in vivo NVUs were clustered in inflammation and immune response, permeability, and adhesion functions. In addition, 1225 DEGs were only identified in the in vivo NVUs but not in vitro BMECs, and these clustered within neuronal and glial functions. One miRNA mmu-miR-3472a was differentially expressed (FCâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰5.98; pâ€‰=â€‰0.07, FDR corrected) in the serum of Ccm3/Pdcd10+/âˆ’ when compared to wild type mice, and this was functionally related as a putative target to Cand2 (cullin associated and neddylation dissociated 2), a DEG in acute and chronic lesional NVUs and in vitro BMECs. Our results suggest that the acute model is characterized by cell proliferation, while the chronic model showed inflammatory, adhesion and permeability processes. In addition, we highlight the importance of extra-endothelial structures in CCM disease, and potential role of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease, interacting with DEGs.

db154c7800b11920f81843ce63cceeb72198c008,Association between sperm mitochondrial ND2 gene variants and total fertilization failure.,"The objective of this study was to explore the association of sperm mitochondrial ND2 (MT-ND2) gene variants with total fertilization failure (TFF). A retrospective comparative study of 246 cases of fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles or half-intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles in the Han Chinese population was performed from July 2011 to May 2017. A total of 59 cases undergoing TFF, and 187 control cases with normal fertilization (fertilization rates >50%) were included. The sperm mitochondrial genovariation was determined using nested sequencing. A total of 32 homoplasmic variants and 47 heteroplasmic variants of MT-ND2 gene were observed in this study. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of the 32 homoplasmic variants of MT-ND2 gene between the TFF and control groups. A total of 53 pair-wise comparisons were performed, and the general characteristics of the IVF failure and control subjects were adjusted in logistic models. Data suggested that there were no significant differences in the frequencies of point 4914, 5320, and 5426 heteroplasmic variants of MT-ND2 gene between the TFF and control groups. In addition, no significant difference was observed in the frequency of mtDNA haplogroup D or haplogroup G between the IVF failure group and the normal fertilization group. This study suggests that the MT-ND2 gene variants might not be associated with TFF.

Any available information should be exploited to increase the power of detecting true between-group effects. We present an adaptive strategy that exploits the data structure and the prior information concerning positive dependence between nodes and connections, without relying on strong assumptions. As a first step, we decompose the brain network, i.e., the connectome, into subnetworks and we apply a screening at the subnetwork level. The subnetworks are defined either according to prior knowledge or by applying a data driven algorithm. Given the results of the screening step, a filtering is performed to seek real differences at the node/connection level. The proposed strategy could be used to strongly control either the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate. We show by means of different simulations the benefit of the proposed strategy, and we present a real application of comparing connectomes of preschool children and adolescents.",2015,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Djalel Eddine Meskaldji"", ids = ""2390968""); list(name = ""Lana Vasung"", ids = ""48577133""); list(name = ""David Romascano"", ids = ""2286794""); list(name = ""Jean-Philippe Thiran"", ids = ""1710257""); list(name = ""Patric Hagmann"", ids = ""1896450""); list(name = ""Stephan Morgenthaler"", ids = ""2375205""); list(name = ""Dimitri Van De Ville"", ids = ""1748289"")",7bd5cc13b2fc71092e6afd72ab75f768ed1d74f9; 161f9d3624dfbec75ec71aca395b745ff27a39a5; 517b3576323062f8e0d1c051ec28194c8e4bc11d; 6af4c41265fe03b500633e9419b7af9f137aa2ce; 15e2349383f29c8cfa8e27b2389d3e030ad46f05; 0a75f91bf10ebf1ad38e2960a8b9b6e20f31184c; f03c7f5f34af4c67ca7672c701af9e0231f42856; 7b78fb7c5d4bb6dc5e7bae8c09178d87a427c024; 183423852a09bee5f529c2f9d2e14795758667ca; 646f77740a74dd81439a9488758af9cf5a036eae; 431aa067a15434e145f0b35520dbd23b4036e72c; 7158d7e1fd5f748aa17b27b7d182f728428b8cd9; 83a3211436a0f5248cc35f3ae4b3b8c69a9d68c5; 74d2017ded9b1e2aded6a26787ea9f9de8089664; d5c617a4e21355a200f5f1132e0adc7ed40c90f3; 48ecedf060e947d4168ab0175461027095502411; b53431b6223bc6dd0d0e0df4e3e2a5e095e86d81,622248a8cdac1c29ae78bae69f28654a14c4bd4f; b953bab39b3230a6c294888b50df771da9767769; 7f532e7de390dd9ffa9da6329f5898842bba6e62; f8342f184985f75b8f903ee45b2d4d87a9469789; 97901b8b7ece99faea15a301186f4a85a5160310; 409d0886811a7c645ece8dc8e95ce1bc0edff3b0; a55df99552d6093b6150fe2ca79d017644b73935; 7c469b7f89043f4867b02938be67d786fc761827; 27f8a049fd3fbe26c7810fd830e16fe55b00dc07; e20bed1b94dd246521bbb8d125821dd494972719; b3a6747b65ecf14393d9fb7c550c0638b1d01b5c; 983ecf48893b33509d4eead25f485f099ad4d6c6; ebbd2cfd1f98d77d7a16db4509c5aaee5ec6f63c; 501d75fdab49a4a03375c723b319a995a0d60847; 2e10881094f9b091364e1f969b33fe2d278bbf42; e6da84a6be687afc8aee35511327fb41d733073e; 3e4c6d704b6f6227b7b1dc2bb915c45ba5b19989; 4094335e6a32b4c7ea53c8a33de741748f71251b; 67bb04b0e456facc3b69cdf1173e4f9dd7d7e54f; 12171edbfe92b01b523833428f4daf7f643518fb; 795b4ad3dd93936af6ababb943f1edc467e909f0; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 9b5d0df936b2dd7886c2f19b564470bdaa1fb558; 9ba6804338e3a7eeb345a129f74cd89adaa4867b; c05ac6172b12cf1bbb37581d2098b99455afad81; 1e919477a3f40478b4e5b0ce5bbf0a922957f0d9; b20cec40d0687f66c611a79ffd8e0ede9120b9ea; 3b99ebfdfada437e3507a39a0b58c5ee9424c8d3; f602c6ba49482d543d0986c5c659a6aa208a0d9c; 5d28314c6491d11016626b3f3fd34b4fabb6465b; 386dfb5cc445dc131596a5177956a1e631b456aa; c43d8dc113ee56b3bd0a29dff8bb3ebcece46792; ebe2f6a423a7dda74b8252a5e2cc2a6496d4ec4f; dc707c0f126e15da2142c2ee9242559e6177e2df; 1f3a53ea9a5f7ff2de68a2ca39546da7ae142fc7; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; be519b639d096870ca7dc6c6727fc5c5c853e588; 4d8b6f78ea9b23d82153c45c31d7822fbd6dc3b7; 9cd87eb83bc93161b226731116ec105c0a9c7cb5; ca030acb4a23806dc10a8202cd6a49cc6fed5998; 4cdeff8bd23b0b26d0dd573345aa9d1f3ede6d01; 60797b83231d26d3ef631a666f4595e45ecb79cd; b817b57882569b292addaa57c63a0bee35991383; 99e8f2b0a6827911fe20bfa7f964fe3a689902e0; c8812e9136cba9ff05045d5d65844af68e7ceddb; 93d550bac33b76f66ab58911c720893e15708a6e; 9e3af7dcfd6b843e1ab8b85b78cdfb5b2947b970; 451988d380a4094f39cdb853a3654cccebf97975; e197caab023d0d40aec7d96e622dc2cbc14e6971; 1eae2f3e32aa89c5f64e71dbae761b8668ba20d7; 65b5b6de48a768526f16ea98fddfa6e4e70af8c1; 7f03219dc03bdf900b8b7440f8b0cdff24331c2a; 71e5a6c95ff476c303c3adeae0c1a4387485f733; 6cbb83db21aea54851dd3abb7719cf05f42db488; 66fc56584654a3aa2be7eb1a45b13dc5beea4f32; af9ea4ec7d1d0ddef13f005e53e66f5f3e1b542a; 5ce7d8019ef35645cbdb0d80a176a40dcf5f81f6; 0d005429a56cd61f9f1a974cd3612fc532119d54; 0250b5c0f7a414dec8c7a0aa7be20c9637eeb6ec; 3d97b76dd9d20bfc84c7b206528624b647182ad1; 538578f986cf3a5d888b4a1d650f875d4710b0a7; 44955c17abc84f7084ff911c9928a9ccb7eb4bb6; 3dabda9bee839bb5e39884e4bd7d08385e36d9b9; edc6558cc916c8bd4b50cb7629319ff2c21d1763; 203d7329be92494f795038f7c43a0442e8a76f3a; 8600a8d8067231b0b854f091b5ffe0eadeeb98e6; 8b31aacd6dfa435329b83e153e13f63218d7e41e; 4dc48d4a4b6b9f971e8cfd5ad4c89dfcfaf3ffcd; d6ad9932aac9225d3edb9bbb27055419eec0e0bb; b222526a2990d9073d734e2a1830210ca14cd8bd; 935acc434920028ad8a0b6ca9a78ef4f9c54445f; 9ff1976f51f00f4036944b2100f042c1ece239a1; 30884263f3a111c61ecb09788b449dc141aa2ff4; 291d7e2724450a783e0a9ef721ac5ea92558d3e5,NeuroImage,108,251-264
14917c39e5350073d1a9bd2ea04269832cdc5330,Title Influence of Hematoma Location on Acute Mortality after Intracerebral Hemorrhage,"Background and Purposeâ€”The current study aimed to identify predictors of acute mortality after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), including voxel-wise analysis of hematoma location. Methodsâ€”In 282 consecutive patients with acute ICH, clinical and radiological predictors of acute mortality were identified. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping examined spatial correlates of acute mortality, contrasting results in basal ganglia ICH and lobar ICH. Resultsâ€”Acute mortality was 47.9%. In bivariate analyses, one clinical (serum glucose) and two radiological (hematoma volume and intraventricular extension) measures significantly predicted mortality. The relationship was strongest for hematoma volume. Multivariable modeling identified four significant predictors of mortality (ICH volume, intraventricular extension, serum glucose, and serum hemoglobin), although this model only minimally improved the predictive value provided by ICH volume alone. Voxel-wise analysis found that for patients with lobar ICH, brain regions where acute hematoma was significantly associated with higher acute mortality included inferior parietal lobule and posterior insula; for patients with basal ganglia ICH, a large region extending from cortex to brainstem. Conclusionsâ€”For patients with lobar ICH, acute mortality is related to both hematoma size and location, with findings potentially useful for therapeutic decision-making. The current findings also underscore differences between the syndromes of acute deep and lobar ICH. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a devastating form of stroke, accounting for approximately 10% of all strokes in the US and 30% in Asia 1. Mortality after ICH approaches 40% in the short-term 2, with reported early mortality rates ranging from 24-51% 3, a rate that has not changed over several decades 4. Improved prediction of acute mortality after ICH could inform several aspects of clinical decision-making. A number of predictors of increased mortality after ICH have been identified. These include clinical measures such as elevated serum glucose and increased age, and radiological measures such as intraventricular spread and larger acute hematoma volume 5-7. Hematoma volume has been recognized as a particularly important biological marker after ICH and a powerful predictor of outcome 8-12, and indeed is a core component of ICH predictive PLEASE DIRECT CORRESPONDENCE TO: Steven C.

However, the numeric relationship between hematoma volume and mortality is informative but does not consider the spatial distribution of this correlation, i.e., whether the impact of an acute hematoma on mortality varies according to its specific location. An improved understanding of mortality after ICH might therefore be available from studying the relationship between hematoma location and mortality. At a gross level, it has long been appreciated that mortality after ICH differs when patients are subgrouped by site of ICH origin, for example, the prognosis with brainstem ICH is poorer than with lobar ICH 13. However, within each of these ICH subgroups, it remains to be determined whether there are specific brain regions where presence of ICH predicts a greater likelihood of early mortality. The current study examined this question in the broader examination of predictors of acute mortality. The main study hypothesis was that there are specific brain regions where occurrence of ICH is associated with a greater likelihood of early mortality. In patients with ischemic stroke, injury to bilateral parietal lobe 14 and bilateral insula 15,16 have been associated with increased mortality, and so a further hypothesis examined in the lobar ICH subgroup was that hematoma in these specific lobar locations would predict increased mortality. To determine whether the location of the acute hematoma is associated with differences in acute mortality, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) 17 was performed on acute head CT scans from consecutive patients with ICH. VLSM statistically assesses clinicalradiological relationships on a voxel-wise basis in stereotaxic space. In VLSM, each voxel in stereotaxic space undergoes statistical analysis to determine if a clinical measure such as behavioral score or mortality rate differs between patients with and patients without a lesion affecting that voxel, with the output of a VLSM analysis being a statistical map that shows where in the brain occurrence of a lesion is associated with a difference in the clinical measure of interest. VLSM takes advantage of the natural variability in brain lesion size and location in order to make this determination. Correction for multiple comparisons can be done in various ways, with a common choice being use of the False Discovery Rate, which calculates the expected proportion of false positives among all reported supra-threshold voxels. VLSM builds upon older methods of lesion overlap by introducing spatial statistics, can identify novel brain areas of interest in contrast to analyses reliant on predefined regions of interest, and its voxel-based approach provides greater spatial resolution than simply describing regional patterns of injury 18. VLSM has proven useful in previous studies of ischemic stroke 19 but has not been previously applied to the study of ICH. The current study also provided an opportunity to contrast findings in two large ICH subgroups, those with lobar ICH and those with ICH originating in the basal ganglia, which have in common some aspects of acute disease presentation but differ in many other regards such as pathogenesis 1,20. Materials and Methods Subjects This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients over 18 years of age who were admitted to UC Irvine Medical Center from December, 2000 to June, 2007 with an ICD-9 code of 431, 432, or 432.9 as primary discharge diagnosis. UC Irvine Medical Center is the only academic medical center in Orange County, CA, the fifth most populous U.S. county 21. Clinical and radiological data were reviewed, and subjects with a primary diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, or epidural hemorrhage were excluded, leaving 475 patients. Of these, 193 subjects were further excluded due to either isolated intraventricular hemorrhage; no available CT scan; or known secondary cause of ICH including saccular aneurysm, tumor, ischemic infarction with secondary hemorrhagic Lee et al.

Slice thickness was 5 mm supratentorially and 5-10 mm thick infratentorially, with slice number adjusted per head size. ICH location was classified as lobar, basal ganglia, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum based on the clinical radiology report and on review by a single neurologist experienced in vascular disease (J-Y L) who was blinded to clinical data at the time of ICH location determination.

91d7967249be7852bfa853f58aeed4d001a1bc81,Analysis of Hepatic Gene Expression in Chickens with Hormonally-induced Lean and Fat Phenotypes,"Obesity is a growing health concern in the United States and has been linked to a global epidemicâ€”the metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this project was to use microarray analysis to unravel the genetic circuits controlling deposition and metabolism of fat in a hormonally-induced obesity model. Glucose, triglyceride, and free fatty acid levels of four-week-old chickens were dramatically altered after acute infusion (six days) of exogenous corticosterone (CS), effectively producing a fat phenotype. A lean phenotype was induced by thyroid hormone (T3), and the interaction of both hormones (CS+T3) was also examined. The Del-Mar 14K Chicken Integrated Systems Microarray (Geo Platform GPL1731) was used to identify differentially expressed hepatic genes (false discovery rate, P < 0.05). In the contrast of fat (CS) and lean (T3) phenotypes, 231 genes were up-regulated by CS, whereas 532 genes were up-regulated by T3. This study revealed several transport proteins, transcription factors, and metabolic enzymes that control lipogenic (CS induced) and lipolytic (T3 induced) pathways. Also, the divergent expression of three genes belonging to the Î²-defensin family (DEFB9, DEFB10, and DEFB11) suggests a novel role for these antimicrobial peptides in adiposity. This project provides new insight into genetic control of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity.

0eacdf46c1f42fe4950038463ae311eb1d058c66,Correlation and variance stabilization in the two group comparison case in high dimensional data under dependencies,"Multiple testing research has undergone renewed focus in recent years as advances in high throughput technologies have produced data on unprecedented scales. Much of the focus has been on false discovery rates (FDR) and related quantities that are estimated (or controlled for) in large scale multiple testing situations. Recent papers by Efron have directly addressed this issue and incorporated measures to account for high-dimensional correlation structure when estimating false discovery rates and when estimating a density. Other authors also have proposed methods to control or estimate FDR under dependencies with certain assumptions. However, not much focus is given to the stability of the results obtained under dependencies in the literature. This work begins by demonstrating the effect of dependence structure on the variance of the number of discoveries and the false discovery proportion (FDP). A variance of the number of discoveries is shown and the density of a test statistic, conditioned on the status (reject or failure to reject) of a different correlated test, is derived. A closed form solution to the correlation between test statistics is also derived. This correlation is a combination of correlations and variances of the data within groups being compared. It is shown that these correlations among the test statistics affect the conditional density and alters the threshold for significance of a correlated test, causing instability in the results. The concept of performing tests within networks, Conditional Network Testing (CNT) is introduced. This method is based on the conditional density mentioned above and uses the correlation between test statistics to construct networks. A method to simulate realistic data with preserved dependence structures is also presented. CNT is evaluated using simple simulations and the proposed simulation method. In addition, existing methods that controls false discovery rates are used on t-tests and CNT for comparing performance. It was shown that the false discovery proportion and type I error proportions are smaller when using CNT versus using t-tests and, in general, results are more stable when applied to CNT. Finally, applications and steps to further improve CNT are discussed.

3acbd1af90c2175079182dfe586d54fda8fdfdea,Potential biomarkers through genome-wide expression analysis of breast cancer samples from Malaysian patients,"Breast cancer is a serious health concern and still a leading cause of death among women in the world. To explore the complexity of this cancer, we performed microarray analysis on highly selective cancer and normal breast tissues. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes between both tissues and to elucidate further molecular pathways involved in breast cancer carcinogenesis. Genome-wide expression profiling was performed on fifteen cancer and five normal breast tissues using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Gene 1.0 ST array. Supervised hierarchical cluster analysis using filtering parameters of -1.5 to 1.5 fold-change and p-value with False Discovery Rate < 0.05 revealed 404 up-regulated and 463 down-regulated genes. Pathway analysis revealed the significant genes were involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, Hedgehog pathway, histone phosphorylation, TRRAP/Tip60 chromatin remodelling and apoptosis regulation. Among the top 10 significantly overexpressed genes were CENPF, DTL and MK167 and these were related to cell cycle regulation. Among the top 10 significant down-regulated genes, HOXA5 and NRG1 were found to be associated with Wnt signalling pathway and ErbB signalling pathway respectively. Aberrations in these genes are likely to promote breast cancer carcinogenesis. Our current findings highlighted the importance of differentially expressed genes in breast cancer and their molecular pathways that linked these genes.

31f42d85b72d3be3da4cfc67374a6b93b2974cf3,Genetic polymorphisms in oxidative stress pathway genes and modification of BMI and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,"BACKGROUND
Being overweight and obese increases oxidative stress in the body. To test the hypothesis that genetic variations in oxidative stress pathway genes modify the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), we conducted a population-based case-control study in Connecticut women.


METHODS
Individuals who were overweight/obese (BMI â‰¥ 25) were compared with normal and underweight individuals (BMI < 25), and their risk of NHL stratified assuming a dominant allele model for each oxidative stress pathway single-nucleotide polymorphism.


RESULTS
Polymorphisms in AKR1A1, AKR1C1, AKR1C3, CYBA, GPX1, MPO, NCF2, NCF4, NOS1, NOS2A NOS3, OGG1, ATG9B, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, RAC1, and RAC2 genes after false discovery rate adjustment did not modify the association between BMI and risk of NHL overall and histologic subtypes.


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that common genetic variations in oxidative stress genes do not modify the relationship between BMI and risk of NHL.


IMPACT
Studies of BMI and oxidative stress independently may elevate NHL risk, but this study suggests no interaction of the two risk factors. Future studies with larger study populations may reveal interactions.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher Kim"", ids = ""48810147""); list(name = ""Tongzhang Zheng"", ids = ""145927602""); list(name = ""Qing Lan"", ids = ""2359692""); list(name = ""Yingtai Chen"", ids = ""51029152""); list(name = ""Francine M Foss"", ids = ""2118251""); list(name = ""Xiao Dong Chen"", ids = ""2362427""); list(name = ""Theodore Holford"", ids = ""3226774""); list(name = ""Brian P.

0937fff9a7da9ebdde408b21a9e2e5ac2c440fc1,Refining spectral library searching.,"Spectral library searching has many advantages over sequence database searching, yet it has not been widely adopted. One possible reason for this is that users are unsure exactly how to interpret the similarity scores (e.g., ""dot products"" are not probability-based scores). Methods to create decoys have been proposed, but, as developers caution, may produce proxies that are not equivalent to reversed sequences. In this issue, Shao et al. (Proteomics 2013, 13, 3273-3283) report advances in spectral library searching where the focus is not on improving the performance of their search engine, SpectraST, but is instead on improving the statistical meaningfulness of its discriminant score and removing the need for decoys. The results in their paper indicate that by ""standardizing"" the input and library spectra, sensitivity is not lost but is, surprisingly, gained. Their tests also show that false discovery rate (FDR) estimates, derived from their new score, track better with ""ground truth"" than decoy searching. It is possible that their work strikes a good balance between the theory of library searching and its application. And as such, they hope to have removed a major entrance barrier for some researchers previously unwilling to try library searching.",2013,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul A.

423f7ec28a00be5b0d82c3a67483763eb426c2f8,Anterior Cingulate Desynchronization and Functional Connectivity with the Amygdala During a Working Memory Task Predict Rapid Antidepressant Response to Ketamine,"Pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) hyperactivity differentiates treatment responders from non-responders to various pharmacological antidepressant interventions, including ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. Evidence of pgACC hyperactivition during non-emotional working memory tasks in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) highlights the importance of this region for processing both emotionally salient and cognitive stimuli. However, it is unclear whether pgACC activity might serve as a potential biomarker of antidepressant response during working memory tasks as well, in line with previous research with emotionally arousing tasks. This study tested the hypothesis that during the N-back task, a widely used working memory paradigm, low pretreatment pgACC activity, as well as coherence between the pgACC and the amygdala, would be correlated with the clinical improvement after ketamine. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were obtained from 15 drug-free patients with MDD during working memory performance 1 to 3 days before receiving a single ketamine infusion. Functional activation patterns were analyzed using advanced MEG source analysis. Source coherence analyses were conducted to quantify the degree of long-range functional connectivity between the pgACC and the amygdala. Patients who showed the least engagement of the pgACC in response to increased working memory load showed the greatest symptomatic improvement within 4â€‰h of ketamine administration (r=0.82, p=0.0002, false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). Pretreatment functional connectivity between the pgACC and the left amygdala was negatively correlated with antidepressant symptom change (r=âˆ’0.73, p=0.0021, FDR <0.05).These data implicate the pgACC and its putative interaction with the amygdala in predicting antidepressant response to ketamine in a working memory task context.",2010,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Giacomo Salvadore"", ids = ""3149880""); list(name = ""Brian R.

804f8f485446132037ab9fd2328125bb756b3b30,DAPAR & ProStaR: software to perform statistical analyses in quantitative discovery proteomics,"DAPAR and ProStaR are software tools to perform the statistical analysis of label-free XIC-based quantitative discovery proteomics experiments. DAPAR contains procedures to filter, normalize, impute missing value, aggregate peptide intensities, perform null hypothesis significance tests and select the most likely differentially abundant proteins with a corresponding false discovery rate. ProStaR is a graphical user interface that allows friendly access to the DAPAR functionalities through a web browser.


AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION
DAPAR and ProStaR are implemented in the R language and are available on the website of the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org/). A complete tutorial and a toy dataset are accompanying the packages.

49d2b1a25610e0b6970c90f379ce5044fc98d553,Changes in Brain Resting-state Functional Connectivity Associated with Peripheral Nerve Block: A Pilot Study.,"BACKGROUND
Limited information exists on the effects of temporary functional deafferentation (TFD) on brain activity after peripheral nerve block (PNB) in healthy humans. Increasingly, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is being used to study brain activity and organization. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that TFD through PNB will influence changes in RSFC plasticity in central sensorimotor functional brain networks in healthy human participants.


METHODS
The authors achieved TFD using a supraclavicular PNB model with 10 healthy human participants undergoing functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging before PNB, during active PNB, and during PNB recovery. RSFC differences among study conditions were determined by multiple-comparison-corrected (false discovery rate-corrected P value less than 0.05) random-effects, between-condition, and seed-to-voxel analyses using the left and right manual motor regions.


RESULTS
The results of this pilot study demonstrated disruption of interhemispheric left-to-right manual motor region RSFC (e.g., mean Fisher-transformed z [effect size] at pre-PNB 1.05 vs. 0.55 during PNB) but preservation of intrahemispheric RSFC of these regions during PNB. Additionally, there was increased RSFC between the left motor region of interest (PNB-affected area) and bilateral higher order visual cortex regions after clinical PNB resolution (e.g., Fisher z between left motor region of interest and right and left lingual gyrus regions during PNB, -0.1 and -0.6 vs. 0.22 and 0.18 after PNB resolution, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
This pilot study provides evidence that PNB has features consistent with other models of deafferentation, making it a potentially useful approach to investigate brain plasticity. The findings provide insight into RSFC of sensorimotor functional brain networks during PNB and PNB recovery and support modulation of the sensory-motor integration feedback loop as a mechanism for explaining the behavioral correlates of peripherally induced TFD through PNB.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""M.

155e666fc636d03bcdb8cb0714ea74139e84e4aa,Parente2: a fast and accurate method for detecting identity by descent.,"Identity-by-descent (IBD) inference is the problem of establishing a genetic connection between two individuals through a genomic segment that is inherited by both individuals from a recent common ancestor. IBD inference is an important preceding step in a variety of population genomic studies, ranging from demographic studies to linking genomic variation with phenotype and disease. The problem of accurate IBD detection has become increasingly challenging with the availability of large collections of human genotypes and genomes: Given a cohort's size, a quadratic number of pairwise genome comparisons must be performed. Therefore, computation time and the false discovery rate can also scale quadratically. To enable accurate and efficient large-scale IBD detection, we present Parente2, a novel method for detecting IBD segments. Parente2 is based on an embedded log-likelihood ratio and uses a model that accounts for linkage disequilibrium by explicitly modeling haplotype frequencies. Parente2 operates directly on genotype data without the need to phase data prior to IBD inference. We evaluate Parente2's performance through extensive simulations using real data, and we show that it provides substantially higher accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high computational efficiency.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan Rodriguez"", ids = ""48878172""); list(name = ""Sivan Bercovici"", ids = ""35360518""); list(name = ""L.

6a3dc8f4f2d1dc0872842cc3fd34625627c74b2d,The Complexities of Evaluating the Exposome in Psychiatry: A Data-Driven Illustration of Challenges and Some Propositions for Amendments,"Identifying modifiable factors through environmental research may improve mental health outcomes. However, several challenges need to be addressed to optimize the chances of success. By analyzing the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 data, we provide a data-driven illustration of how closely connected the exposures and the mental health outcomes are and how model and variable specifications produce ""vibration of effects"" (variation of results under multiple different model specifications). Interdependence of exposures is the rule rather than the exception. Therefore, exposure-wide systematic approaches are needed to separate genuine strong signals from selective reporting and dissect sources of heterogeneity. Pre-registration of protocols and analytical plans is still uncommon in environmental research. Different studies often present very different models, including different variables, despite examining the same outcome, even if consistent sets of variables and definitions are available. For datasets that are already collected (and often already analyzed), the exploratory nature of the work should be disclosed. Exploratory analysis should be separated from prospective confirmatory research with truly pre-specified analysis plans. In the era of big-data, where very low P values for trivial effects are detected, several safeguards may be considered to improve inferences, eg, lowering P-value thresholds, prioritizing effect sizes over significance, analyzing pre-specified falsification endpoints, and embracing alternative approaches like false discovery rates and Bayesian methods. Any claims for causality should be cautious and preferably avoided, until intervention effects have been validated. We hope the propositions for amendments presented here may help with meeting these pressing challenges.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sinan Guloksuz"", ids = ""4289245""); list(name = ""Bart P F Rutten"", ids = ""145309733""); list(name = ""Lotta-Katrin Pries"", ids = ""13259779""); list(name = ""M Ten Have"", ids = ""116178465""); list(name = ""Ron de Graaf"", ids = ""52098299""); list(name = ""Saskia van Dorsselaer"", ids = ""100761350""); list(name = ""Boris Klingenberg"", ids = ""12408521""); list(name = ""Jim van os"", ids = ""38069207""); list(name = ""John P.

175bb823b4ccf2fac22268ac71c342b058ab89cc,Contextual Online False Discovery Rate Control,"Multiple hypothesis testing, a situation when we wish to consider many hypotheses, is a core problem in statistical inference that arises in almost every scientific field. In this setting, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the expected proportion of type I error, is an important challenge for making meaningful inferences. In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling FDR in an online manner. Concretely, we consider an ordered, possibly infinite, sequence of hypotheses, arriving one at each timestep, and for each hypothesis we observe a p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. The decision whether or not to reject the current hypothesis must be made immediately at each timestep, before the next hypothesis is observed. The model of multi-dimensional feature set provides a very general way of leveraging the auxiliary information in the data which helps in maximizing the number of discoveries. 
We propose a new class of powerful online testing procedures, where the rejections thresholds (significance levels) are learnt sequentially by incorporating contextual information and previous results. We prove that any rule in this class controls online FDR under some standard assumptions. We then focus on a subclass of these procedures, based on weighting significance levels, to derive a practical algorithm that learns a parametric weight function in an online fashion to gain more discoveries. We also theoretically prove, in a stylized setting, that our proposed procedures would lead to an increase in the achieved statistical power over a popular online testing procedure proposed by Javanmard & Montanari (2018). Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of our procedure, by comparing it to state-of-the-art online multiple testing procedures, on both synthetic data and real data generated from different applications.",2020,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Shiyun Chen"", ids = ""3391923""); list(name = ""Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan"", ids = ""7993151"")",,b48771cb8077c13971c35b48f8386fa5ac5bcb79; 2a996166c3e3c9373981d3fc1f60b71957987ead; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b680bc211550d283bc2800eb9db32353364e19dc; e043d8b0d15ed08c705c20b4a5da98f3bcfd5b17; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 2c04d5311caee78b3dddd90e5ad0ef509fc8a70d; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,

Variation Revealed by Combining RNA-Seq
Proteogenomics and Global Post-Translational Modification (G-PTM)
Search Strategy","Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis underestimates proteomic variation due to the absence of variant peptides and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) from standard protein databases. Each individual carries thousands of missense mutations that lead to single amino acid variants, but these are missed because they are absent from generic proteomic search databases. Myriad types of protein PTMs play essential roles in biological processes but remain undetected because of increased false discovery rates in variable modification searches. We address these two fundamental shortcomings of bottom-up proteomics with two recently developed software tools. The first consists of workflows in Galaxy that mine RNA sequencing data to generate sample-specific databases containing variant peptides and products of alternative splicing events. The second tool applies a new strategy that alters the variable modification approach to consider only curated PTMs at specific positions, thereby avoiding the combinatorial explosion that traditionally leads to high false discovery rates. Using RNA-sequencing-derived databases with this Global Post-Translational Modification (G-PTM) search strategy revealed hundreds of single amino acid variant peptides, tens of novel splice junction peptides, and several hundred posttranslationally modified peptides in each of ten human cell lines.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anthony J Cesnik"", ids = ""5301842""); list(name = ""Michael R Shortreed"", ids = ""4940508""); list(name = ""Gloria M.

38e84410e26143fba1acf35ae2c78944e66b9e57,Logistic regression for disease classification using microarray data: model selection in a large p and small n case,"MOTIVATION
Logistic regression is a standard method for building prediction models for a binary outcome and has been extended for disease classification with microarray data by many authors. A feature (gene) selection step, however, must be added to penalized logistic modeling due to a large number of genes and a small number of subjects. Model selection for this two-step approach requires new statistical tools because prediction error estimation ignoring the feature selection step can be severely downward biased. Generic methods such as cross-validation and non-parametric bootstrap can be very ineffective due to the big variability in the prediction error estimate.


RESULTS
We propose a parametric bootstrap model for more accurate estimation of the prediction error that is tailored to the microarray data by borrowing from the extensive research in identifying differentially expressed genes, especially the local false discovery rate. The proposed method provides guidance on the two critical issues in model selection: the number of genes to include in the model and the optimal shrinkage for the penalized logistic regression. We show that selecting more than 20 genes usually helps little in further reducing the prediction error. Application to Golub's leukemia data and our own cervical cancer data leads to highly accurate prediction models.

6231be533dde8e846dfdbd333138a9ce27773e92,Abstract P4-12-01: Molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer based on HER2 gene amplification,"Background: HER2-amplified (HER2+) breast cancer is biologically heterogeneous and all the intrinsic molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and Basal-like) can be identified. However, the molecular and outcome differences of the intrinsic subtypes based on HER2 status have not been thoroughly studied. This is important since HER2 is considered an oncogene involved in the activation of various signal transduction pathways, as well as a biomarker of poor prognosis (in the absence of anti-HER2 targeting). Methods: To compare molecular features between clinically HER2+ and HER2-negative tumors, we interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) publicly available dataset of 825 primary breast cancers with at least one of following data types: mRNA expression (17,784 genes), protein expression (171 proteins and phospho-proteins), DNA methylation status (574 probes), miRNA expression (306 transcripts) and whole exome somatic mutations. Two-class unpaired Significant Analyses of Microarrays were used to identify significant biomarker associations with a False Discovery Rate of 0%. For survival associations, we interrogated the METABRIC DNA copy number/gene expression-based dataset (Curtis et al. Nature) composed of 1,971 primary breast tumors with long-term clinical follow-up (and no adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy). Multivariable Cox models were used to test the prognostic significance of each variable. The research based 50-gene PAM50 model was used to classify tumors into the different intrinsic subtypes. Results: In both datasets combined (n = 2,225), HER2+ disease showed an enrichment for HER2-enriched tumors (47.0% vs. 7.1%) and a decrease in Luminal A tumors (7.3% vs. 39.0%) compared to HER2-negative disease (p Conclusions: When the intrinsic subtypes are taken into account, HER2 amplification does not translate into large changes in the activation of downstream signaling pathways or worse patient survival outcomes. These results also suggest that the potential responses to anti-HER2 therapy on HER2-amplified tumor cells depend in part upon their intrinsic tumor profile.

8bc4e0fd3f085b2037baf9f73192f501e67d2e56,Study on the sub-regions volume of hippocampus and amygdala in schizophrenia.,"Background
Many studies have found volume changes in the hippocampus and amygdala in patients with schizophrenia, but these findings have not reached an agreement. Particularly, few results showed the volumes of the sub-regions of the amygdala. In this research, we aim to clarify volume changes of hippocampus and amygdala sub-regions in patients with schizophrenia.


Methods
The sample consisted of 69 patients with schizophrenia and 72 control subjects aged from 18 to 65 years. FreeSurfer 6.0 software was used on T1-weighted images to assess the volumes of hippocampus and amygdala and their sub-regions. The general linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the volume changes between the two groups. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed, and the significance level was set at 0.05.


Results
The hippocampus volume in schizophrenia showed reduction compared to healthy control (P<0.05). Several hippocampal subfields showed smaller volume in schizophrenia patients, including bilateral presubiculum and molecular layer, left hippocampal tail, subiculum and cornus ammonis (CA)1, and right parasubiculum (P<0.05). Left amygdala volume showed a decrease as well, sub-regions including the bilateral basal nucleus, anterior-amygdaloid-area (AAA), paralaminar nucleus and left lateral nucleus (P<0.05).


Conclusions
Several sub-regions of hippocampus and amygdala showed a volumetric decline in patients group, which suggest the key roles of these regions in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Based on these results, we speculate that these regions could be used to assess the early finding of schizophrenia.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fenglian Zheng"", ids = ""35613193""); list(name = ""Chuntong Li"", ids = ""5653895""); list(name = ""Dong-sheng Zhang"", ids = ""47845294""); list(name = ""Dong Cui"", ids = ""49862762""); list(name = ""Zhipeng Wang"", ids = ""47197114""); list(name = ""Jianfeng Qiu"", ids = ""46392719"")",878c0cbfc983fa8b8c4e4aae5719c97489ae864d; 8bc4e0fd3f085b2037baf9f73192f501e67d2e56,eb5f19ef47923fd9b85a00d02481c7e57f13e7aa; c6570424909d691ca0d96cb602d3dfe240f08c60; 3499a04cdb1cfba1f21bf41b181f6086fe883779; b8893ffd14d607058171a98d62cd48a8dcd4645d; 5bed7b8191df43add998b1760e0da2ceb3848bbd; 59f9b6e6a888cea13379e56667d59f69a5ecccc6; e8fb9751115adde72a4996d3519555f02b421f77; de4cf65b360dd1b064796a0fad813c753889b9e2; 12e667b776826f9e05f1245c714d90fc24c5d21b; bd1c791fe5e21d5b01f1a9d0e6e3ba63d1a8a033; 7a658a558de181cea4cf3f76ad1758819e15da91; d57971feb990fe223a2b3b16f8b17d4049bc05a1; 8572abfe9b92cf167e0bf10d866f269da184ca6d; 08872296b876807efa8a429fa0fbb7f3b87a1ee1; 2861c24bc829f963a594a5916a9ce9616b6486d7; b173556295c7354db5e3c42ace197a84376858a5; e240925e01b458c95b6f4db9ad6f4b29d96c5b9e; b285f07d70b07053f0f98ce3f809f73576cc651d; 34b5868e7cc4c8f25b0f1ead36aba1a57c22ffbb; 465c1088548afb66abee7b87d571eb311af9fccf; c65a4fe64dc829801a47f3e8f806bbab0dcecf4e; 460f62651d415e30ec15c7ff9c93388f333f0858; 7ef7601fbc5337921aa5cea23259408b6ffbaeb1; a334bba3960d3cf26d8fca9282de6fe4a1b9054c; b5300591d83654217df7a243f5e00860e8c2792b; 1f419146ef08534c23f642e0136dcd73321ace43; 8bc4e0fd3f085b2037baf9f73192f501e67d2e56; 018b056424280ac4936e5988106dc17e26b1354f; f7241ec23d6b4f60113638765fd1a45aa09d1bb3; 2cb745d98b7b84201e05321424d4060c10528cf8; ef7f5dd6ccfeda3ecd7c08d1e4681696946be397; b0c2e11764940db4248c90bb576863ad5eb6f4b0; ddeba52fc245d79098c47efccd07ccb9570007d3; 1f563c699c0b50d76f6ba3ed773b98291a304af6; 3c844ffc1c69e5dd6d198301a5a4ef79b04805b7; b262fe20bfae030d214f25f9893e5dd7618c4f00; 6ca420a1018be635c1b93d5174a4a52279818d2f; 7ad5d46ba5e5cef4f248742c144c436cb3c03dfe; 9e9cbd5eceec123ca9a6f122bf729c0501f12044; fbafffbe78ae6dd4ae7fbc4f756ca1e8e7133f32; 49e74e4b3508de8d6b37ddf15a5ee0d34d0d3c1b; 6cb0db2630f6878039bd808054ea88aacaa9b8cb; 574f304a8a9e6487b4fbdc08ca72087547100efc; 6883dd26a5a2bcbbefe21617fb631eab9dda8127; 96aef231e6dfd575bfdcc48d7822398ccb52ee8c; d499c9e69a556d843c027bdcefa7490213eb68e1; 324babe5287614629cc5b154fcd401efbd65dacc; 48d2a49683a8a7bf2664c67544bd39b4bffccd72; bf56ecb2e237342e527c3fa7b64cb7553d2da757; 5d171e0acc0b2c97db3f04f503e1e3879f40c4b5; eaa9d79a349a714fe334139c2aecea6e16d9212b; 5f84f12979364bcb65be94bc14c181c570c3e6e3; 0047f1bd6925a2124d4db54611a4bc6ed070fe64; 422c3d1bf2c9e90ec19e1d1c5ff928848f12d8dc; 7f6ecd4af867f450ad9c0e5283d0aa35ee5517b4; b56fbf589a02cc82fb2ff07fe196e3bea7887447; 8090104f2e321f78a35ece62a3b4883a60968d65; de8b3cb35662a6fbbc8a8b97328c514fdfbfe82f; cc1dc93d0a47213120dd1a594abcc80aa34d018c; 3d1d4ce140f4ea5b0752547307a0d9297f4bc4db,Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,9 6,"

e9c626aa39e7825b928a50cfa6f701596697675f,An Integrated Systems Biology and Network-Based Approaches to Identify Novel Biomarkers in Breast Cancer Cell Lines Using Gene Expression Data.,"Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women worldwide. Approximately 5%-10% of instances are attributed to mutations acquired from the parents. Therefore, it is highly recommended to design more potential drugs and drug targets to eradicate such complex diseases. Network-based gene expression profiling is a suggested tool for discovering drug targets by incorporating various factors such as disease states, intensities based on gene expression as well as protein-protein interactions. To find prospective biomarkers in breast cancer, we first identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) statistical methods p-value and false discovery rate were initially used. Of the total 82 DEGs, 67 were upregulated while the remaining 17 were downregulated. Sub-modules and hub genes include VEGFA with the highest degree, followed by 15 CCND1 and CXCL8 with 12-degree score was found. The survival analysis revealed that all the hub genes have important role in the development and progression of breast cancer. Enrichment analysis revealed that most of these genes are involved in signaling pathways and in the extracellular spaces. We also identified transcription factors and kinases, which regulate proteins in the DEGs PPI. Finally, drugs for each hub genes were identified. These results further expanded the knowledge regarding important biomarkers in breast cancer.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Abbas Khan"", ids = ""144281726""); list(name = ""Zainab Rehman"", ids = ""1492084852""); list(name = ""Huma Farooque Hashmi"", ids = ""1492084827""); list(name = ""Abdul Aziz Khan"", ids = ""50724346""); list(name = ""Muhammad Junaid"", ids = ""49401152""); list(name = ""Abrar Mohammad Sayaf"", ids = ""1391240888""); list(name = ""Syed Shujait Ali"", ids = ""5903617""); list(name = ""Fakhr Ul Hassan"", ids = ""1492084670""); list(name = ""Wang Heng"", ids = ""48077564""); list(name = ""Dong-Qing Wei"", ids = ""13763835"")",,,"Interdisciplinary sciences, computational life sciences",,

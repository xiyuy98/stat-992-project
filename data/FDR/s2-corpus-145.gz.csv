cf273c8f8694444f48a0b39a345a987eb702c972,Genome-wide association study identifies loci influencing natural antibody titers in milk of Dutch Holstein-Friesian cattle.,"Natural antibodies (NAb) are produced without any antigenic stimulation as a part of the innate immune system and provide a first line of defense against pathogens. Hence, they may be a useful trait when estimating an animal's potential immune competence and in selection for disease resistance. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions associated with different NAb traits in milk and potentially describe candidate genes. Milk samples from 1,695 first-lactation Holstein Friesian cows with titer measurements for keyhole limpet hemocyanin, lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan-binding total NAb and isotypes IgG1, IgM, and IgA were used. Genome-wide association study analyses were performed using imputed 777K SNP genotypes, accounting for relationships using pedigree information. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on the significantly associated genomic regions to look for candidate genes. For IgM NAb, significant associations (false discovery rate <0.05) were found on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 17, 18, and 21 with candidate genes related to immunoglobulin structure and early B cell development. For IgG1, associations were found on BTA3, and we confirmed a quantitative trait loci on BTA21 previously reported for IgG NAb in serum. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of milk NAb that will help unravel the complex relationship between milk immunoglobulins and disease resistance in dairy cattle.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Juan Cordero-solorzano"", ids = ""1416208083""); list(name = ""Henk K.

d84d044e864cf448cfb1ae82eae7d1613e91536c,LR-DNase: Predicting TF binding from DNase-seq data,"Transcription factors play a key role in the regulation of gene expression. Hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage has long been used to gauge the accessibility of genomic DNA for transcription factor binding and as an indicator of regulatory genomic locations. An increasing amount of ChIP-seq data on a large number of TFs is being generated, mostly in a small number of cell types. DNase-seq data are being produced for hundreds of cell types. We aimed to develop a computational method that could combine ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data to predict TF binding sites in a wide variety of cell types. We trained and tested a logistic regression model, called LR-DNase, to predict binding sites for a specific TF using seven features derived from DNase-seq and genomic sequence. We calculated the area under the precision-recall curve at a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.5 for the LR-DNase model, a number of logistic regression models with fewer features, and several existing state-of-the-art TF binding prediction methods. The LR-DNase model outperformed existing unsupervised and supervised methods. Additionally, for many TFs, a model that uses only two features, DNase-seq reads and motif score, was sufficient to match the performance of the best existing methods.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Arjan van der Velde"", ids = ""1600381555""); list(name = ""Michael J.

07877ace8a12cb093f9b357330b396e4c350590a,Genetic variation in the lipoxygenase pathway and risk of colorectal neoplasia.,"Arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX) enzymes metabolize arachidonic acid to generate potent inflammatory mediators and play an important role in inflammation-associated diseases. We investigated associations between colorectal cancer risk and polymorphisms in ALOX5, FLAP, ALOX12, and ALOX15, and their interactions with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. We genotyped fifty tagSNPs, one candidate SNP, and two functional promoter variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in three US population-based case-control studies of colon cancer (1,424 cases/1,780 controls), rectal cancer (583 cases/775 controls), and colorectal adenomas (485 cases/578 controls). Individuals with variant genotypes of the ALOX5 VNTR had a decreased risk of rectal cancer, with the strongest association seen for individuals with one or more alleles of >5 repeats (wild type = 5, OR>5/â‰¥5 = 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.92; P = 0.01). Four SNPs in FLAP (rs17239025), ALOX12 (rs2073438), and ALOX15 (rs4796535 and rs2619112) were associated with rectal cancer risk at P â‰¤ 0.05. One SNP in FLAP (rs12429692) was associated with adenoma risk. A false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to account for false positives due to multiple testing; the ALOX15 associations were noteworthy at 25% FDR. Colorectal neoplasia risk appeared to be modified by NSAID use in individuals with variant alleles in FLAP and ALOX15. One noteworthy interaction (25% FDR) was observed for rectal cancer. Genetic variability in ALOXs may affect risk of colorectal neoplasia, particularly for rectal cancer. Additionally, genetic variability in FLAP and ALOX15 may modify the protective effect of NSAID use against colorectal neoplasia.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah E Kleinstein"", ids = ""153444704""); list(name = ""Laura Heath"", ids = ""2940395""); list(name = ""Karen W.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is essential for dopamine metabolism in the brain, and normal variation in the COMT Val158Met polymorphism can influence regional brain function during cognitive tasks. How this is affected when central dopamine function is perturbed is unclear. We addressed this by comparing the effects of COMT Val158Met genotype on cortical activation during a task of executive functions in healthy and schizophrenic subjects.


METHODS
We studied 90 subjects comprising 48 healthy volunteers (15 Met158/Met158, 20 Val158/Met158, and 13 Val158/Val158) and 42 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia (13 Met158/Met158, 17 Val158/Met158, and 12 Val158/Val158). Subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a verbal fluency task, with performance recorded online. Main effects of genotype and diagnosis and their interaction on cortical activation and functional connectivity were assessed using SPM5.


RESULTS
In the right peri-Sylvian cortex, the Met158 allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism was associated with greater activation than the Val158 allele in control subjects; the converse applied in patients (Z = 4.3; false discovery rate p = .04). There was also a strong trend for a group x genotype interaction on functional connectivity between this right peri-Sylvian region and the left anterior insula/operculum (Z = 3.4; p < .001, uncorrected). These findings were independent of between-group differences in task performance, medication, demographic factors, or IQ.


CONCLUSIONS
Frontotemporal function during verbal generation is modulated by variation in COMT genotype. This effect is altered in schizophrenia, which may reflect the perturbation of central dopamine function associated with the disorder.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Diana P.

86ff88e688b9ef19d5a1b82e3feb1796b39b2fe1,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of triheptanoin in adult polyglucosan body disease and open-label, long-term outcome","BackgroundAdult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) is a progressive neurometabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of glycogen branching enzyme. We tested the efficacy of triheptanoin as a therapy for patients with APBD based on the hypothesis that decreased glycogen degradation leads to brain energy deficit.Methods and resultsThis was a two-site, randomized crossover trial of 23 patients (age 35â€“73Â years; 63% men) who received triheptanoin or vegetable oil as placebo. The trial took place over 1Â year and was followed by a 4-year open-label phase. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze this study. At baseline, using the 6-min walk test, patients could walk a mean of 389Â Â±Â 164Â m (range 95â€“672; nÂ =Â 19), highlighting the great clinical heterogeneity of our cohort. The overall mean difference between patients on triheptanoin versus placebo was 6Â m; 95% confidence interval (CI) âˆ’11 to 22; pÂ =Â 0.50. Motion capture gait analysis, gait quality, and stair climbing showed no consistent direction of change. All secondary endpoints were statistically nonsignificant after false discovery rate adjustment. Triheptanoin was safe and generally well tolerated. During the open-label phase of the study, the most affected patients at baseline kept deteriorating while mildly disabled patients remained notably stable up to 4Â years.ConclusionsWe cannot conclude that triheptanoin was effective in the treatment of APBD over a 6-month period, but we found it had a good safety profile. This study also emphasizes the difficulty of conducting trials in very rare diseases presenting with a wide clinical heterogeneity.

We used the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique in a population-based sample of 331 nondemented people in order to investigate the relationship between these factors and the cerebral volume (a marker of brain reserve). The results showed a positive and significant association between education, occupation, and leisure activities and the cognitive performances on Isaac's set test. Among these factors, only education was significantly associated with a cerebral volume including gray and white matter (p = 0.01). In voxel-based morphometry analyses, the difference in gray matter volume was located in the temporoparietal lobes and in the orbitofrontal lobes bilaterally (a p-value corrected <0.05 by false discovery rate [FDR]). Although smaller, the education-related difference in white matter volume appeared in areas connected to the education-related difference in gray matter volume. Education, occupation attainment, and leisure activities were found to contribute differently to reserve capacity.

2a42c8a9ff889e3657420a5697e99bc495e921be,Patterns of cortical thinning in the language variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration,"Background:Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a clinically, genetically, and pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. Two subtypes commonly present with a language disorder: semantic dementia (SemD) and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). Methods:Patients meeting consensus criteria for PNFA and SemD who had volumetric MRI of sufficient quality to allow cortical thickness analysis were recruited from a tertiary referral clinic: 44 (11 pathologically confirmed) patients with SemD and 32 (4 pathologically confirmed) patients with PNFA and 29 age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. Cortical thickness analysis was performed using the Freesurfer software tools. Results:Patients with SemD had significant cortical thinning in the left temporal lobe, particularly temporal pole, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri. A similar but less extensive pattern of loss was seen in the right temporal lobe and (with increasing severity) also in left orbitofrontal, inferior frontal, insular, and cingulate cortices. Patients with PNFA had involvement particularly of the left superior temporal lobe, inferior frontal lobe, and insula, and (with increasing severity) other areas in the left frontal, lateral temporal, and anterior parietal lobes. Similar patterns were seen in the pathologically confirmed cases. Patterns of cortical thinning differed between groups: SemD had significantly more cortical thinning in the temporal lobes bilaterally while PNFA had significantly more thinning in the frontal and parietal lobes. Conclusions:The language variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration have distinctive and significantly different patterns of cortical thinning. Increasing disease severity is associated with spread of cortical thinning and the pattern of spread is consistent with progression of clinical deficits.

22ca3668d8a92e24811edae69468d77977233f54,Thresholding functional connectomes by means of mixture modeling,"&NA; Functional connectivity has been shown to be a very promising tool for studying the largeâ€scale functional architecture of the human brain. In network research in fMRI, functional connectivity is considered as a set of pairâ€wise interactions between the nodes of the network. These interactions are typically operationalized through the full or partial correlation between all pairs of regional time series. Estimating the structure of the latent underlying functional connectome from the set of pairâ€wise partial correlations remains an open research problem though. Typically, this thresholding problem is approached by proportional thresholding, or by means of parametric or nonâ€parametric permutation testing across a cohort of subjects at each possible connection. As an alternative, we propose a dataâ€driven thresholding approach for network matrices on the basis of mixture modeling. This approach allows for creating subjectâ€specific sparse connectomes by modeling the full set of partial correlations as a mixture of low correlation values associated with weak or unreliable edges in the connectome and a sparse set of reliable connections. Consequently, we propose to use alternative thresholding strategy based on the model fit using pseudoâ€False Discovery Rates derived on the basis of the empirical null estimated as part of the mixture distribution. We evaluate the method on synthetic benchmark fMRI datasets where the underlying network structure is known, and demonstrate that it gives improved performance with respect to the alternative methods for thresholding connectomes, given the canonical thresholding levels. We also demonstrate that mixture modeling gives highly reproducible results when applied to the functional connectomes of the visual system derived from the nâ€back Working Memory task in the Human Connectome Project. The sparse connectomes obtained from mixture modeling are further discussed in the light of the previous knowledge of the functional architecture of the visual system in humans. We also demonstrate that with use of our method, we are able to extract similar information on the group level as can be achieved with permutation testing even though these two methods are not equivalent. We demonstrate that with both of these methods, we obtain functional decoupling between the two hemispheres in the higher order areas of the visual cortex during visual stimulation as compared to the resting state, which is in line with previous studies suggesting lateralization in the visual processing. However, as opposed to permutation testing, our approach does not require inference at the cohort level and can be used for creating sparse connectomes at the level of a single subject. HighlightsSparse functional connectomes are useful in analyzing and interpreting fMRI data.We propose thresholding by means of mixture modeling and control of FDR.We benchmark the approach on synthetic fMRI data against established methods.We apply the method to the resting state and working memory task datasets from HCP500.Results are reproducible on synthetic data and interpretable on experimental data.",2018,Psychology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Natalia Z.

14b741a091d7eae2a7b1c27281a9e4417a587f08,A Factor Model Approach to Multiple Testing Under Dependence,"The impact of dependence between individual test statistics is currently among the most discussed topics in the multiple testing of high-dimensional data literature, especially since Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) introduced the false discovery rate (FDR). Many papers have first focused on the impact of dependence on the control of the FDR. Some more recent works have investigated approaches that account for common information shared by all the variables to stabilize the distribution of the error rates. Similarly, we propose to model this sharing of information by a factor analysis structure for the conditional variance of the test statistics. It is shown that the variance of the number of false discoveries increases along with the fraction of common variance. Test statistics for general linear contrasts are deduced, taking advantage of the common factor structure to reduce the variance of the error rates. A conditional FDR estimate is proposed and the overall performance of multiple testing procedure is s...",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""ChloÃ© Friguet"", ids = ""2545540""); list(name = ""Maela Kloareg"", ids = ""10748702""); list(name = ""David Causeur"", ids = ""2234785"")",dfcec34c58d1e0800f64f54ebe9aa568e3d2be46; ddadfdc5bce82fcf5179038ddff6e2176d5ee84f; 220d19025c70489a87b139e7fa368dab588cb490; b789f675ca9600eab82a39c581abc1db53d47d14; 98b3184c60b3be0b310d8a78a94719760d4fd9a4; c9a7bb3bf94c1421bf4957af43bd2167c3e02d8f; d70e478a8681ce53fcae271b0dc7d8758aaa6d4e; 3141e2bc8f420ecf7cd7ed2d92f6ea9a7a86024e; e9bfcfee33f0e484a6e5cdc8ff0c9ddee7e02504; 128ffa81cd4b020e1a4aafacd77d6025545c189d; 49ac20419a91c08c6cf1f83739403ec35392e310; 1e0658277dc6c7c89138dc2f7dd50c9bfee0c617; 814a6ec73a025e9d7ebc27d1e0b832cfd6a6a533; ab8adcea4ce5581278ae508d7b012f54d292dcbf; bb205f0c917f3eb3ee6ea4b323ea34372b245d80; 393d8c270be14191ffdfa0c60fce04d2aa3f4afb; bf468213c8802bfea7dbaf78ebb9f98dfe8ee195; ec22d633fcf6e2481953fba8d837368069314159; 1c55a47755f507ef7cf090055acec565864dacb4; 67712103338b22cde904ba7eb10601daf3c1ef71; 18af5f300d507e74470077e3ea19327350d7980e; fb4d10d33b4476bc8f251918817c9dd7a7bd59ea; 8bb4affed4c40ec9bdfa0f2b1d5e9672b9f52bc0; c9ac002f079c86da24d3f3ba842d36b4b840b517; 3264f21e5757d26cc75e2a4ff523747732dfd843; 2b51f228cb47ef9de195aaff6c03fae3b41047f6; a438453add52542eae1a6710dfd5e66990376ed4; dfef9b71cbb09106bf84cafd83ff656e1d5eabe2; 5f43c0d071c1daf74cbecaf4ae500dfd26f68550; 86007b78b5b3ed7ab7f982ed3e6d80b12a44cc08; 37814d8c14b8eeefac7a8e5f998957ec5a7946fa; d385eadf84bc1ec6233d6ebe867c3b5f15681622; d30d3ab395bb09f120b0dd20c83b07fae979e11f; 786bf5300bafdee56ff412a8ad792847c01be973; d3fbc69e2b7ed7d184bb1b6ffbb5ea370319816e; 60f9c181ff8e25e80b5b30df8823014d843b7322; 427f309e6c61c45db814a4b532b242110fcc92b9; 0f329bd3c17018839b8caf98237a4817f556f795; 78a44070790ea8211e5f8234eaf8dc195e32a361; d0686c1edd5b143758a6e567d929eb00fda4eb3c; 2afb62827b708468857a436dc944087326b49eb4; 9138182644dd05a9d84d772cb29c463ac9a9e9a3; 126c04a30f3e81565d51081ef8a8983664d5ba5a; 50415aae8f524d573528d997c732fb3848875a80; e079efca326f42b0c97648ec09ea585f520758cc; 607b7cdbab2fcb78b996965490c910837f824ff1; b30ef6d39c299568d63d5b14a17183fbde643964; c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf; b0641f564c0b7a1746d8495b03e931e10f7be705; bcf15c2c260517184b73321727f287fe0be92ebd; b3bbd96da9390009b744614bc64dae7a957cd7a7; db058714aebc7268d7e318ad1e189d19b444727e; 292b5ccb390e53de3ede7b7efc484ec5e92fcde9; 06ea5e326ddf2f077de191bb4e4b78dbe3cd4e50; b3c350f9f25b3e970372fdd2579fc55447ba88e0; 1098fb0241ce5cd3c07df145a506da5617018ee0; 5a975f73e954f49a1321852ff9fd9999a0157da4; d829e9312f5bbfbd1e1c7234e00a4480c176bd5d; 938de376807d00a99657fc9e2d18abe683e336fd; a26c957cac1ef5c59b60b50999e5f3e65cbf33d1; c32d94ef97ae97750460c2038babaa0ed4877e43; d8e7a03c6ee282130425e170dd3927165aaad1a1; 9cb4205cbdfebd43e13ee3fd3f4b8f1340c34456; 3b6f86c18c2ac927332200acc56d0691ae2b5afe; 75bdfc843186ea55717c4c8a39f85f60dec27d73; 4f66c5f894d82de33fcdf8572efea0e15f8c017e; 0411079e9c554ae07970b640b4a0371f21c7beec; c8b6a47cded87f00c089cd3fdaae4a010f643665; 462e24910b71ac2895f18dc46d94237dc20fece0; 11f2d4ccd69e5d90c4eaf0607c356547e49a890d; 31e528f942397819a5a05ae76c49ecb064270e99; 6f548518ad200cbbf0b30d0a3af6e6d28dc5c98f; ee735881ea1ba85eda733d0f4b4b0f25eaa37877; f894480feb384ec064962637bbcba1a3b45716ab; b3e9c70969cb73096ce3df1065190a04e568a13a; 86a0fc00f7a3aded35220e7e5135a4ad8af51dd1; 963536bf9f586569e75888c0363ced3df4750b8b; a60bfeeaabb7f54d2a1b00ef19aa4979691b2d79; 80a34615d75ac2b811a1b28dcbd583adde6db15c; 2b2d6bc3f420ef7747aca72bf925f590d326656c; 266f3e55f79591036718d1dda465ebbb4fbe2f25; dd4fff68ef70dc700b1b61895ede800cd2ecbdf6; 623029ae0217fc6d3e1a4d5ad1f5704530a5f0c1; 019ffe59978570408c062b8130eab03e852a8719; 359cbc3cd6c9d106d28b6c90debb7b89057f30d4; b0fdde6e3d44ddcff86fe9c0be223dc605b06130; 09504e09ce1e176e7d8b47daa0e67fcae6d0f420; 31bb692add51af3736f7ac3bad5b5c907b185c61; c3318bf5c3c807bc6c8538416a0b35936bb66d78; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 8bd51f873d9d9cd792d4d7b623571f3f39e1a6f8,,Journal of the American Statistical Association,104,1406-1415

There is now a large body of literature in this area and basically five paradigms of massive multiple tests: control of the false discovery rate (FDR), estimation of FDR, significance threshold criteria, control of family-wise error rate (FWER) or generalized FWER (gFWER), and empirical Bayes approaches. This paper contains a technical survey of the developments of the FDR-related paradigms, emphasizing precise formulation of the problem, concepts of error measurements, and considerations in applications.

c8440aa3b3372ceed86105bdc8845ee3a5f375ab,Qualification and Verification of Protein Biomarker Candidates.,"The importance of biomarkers has long been recognized by the public, scientific community, and industry. Yet despite extensive efforts and funding investments in biomarker discovery, only 109 protein biomarkers in plasma or serum were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration throughout 2008 (Anderson NL. Clin Chem 56:177-185, 2010), and even fewer protein biomarkers are currently used routinely in the clinic. In recent years, the introduction of new protein biomarkers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration has fallen to an average of 1.5 per year (a median of only 1 per year) (Anderson NL. Clin Chem 56:177-185, 2010). The low efficiency of biomarker development is due to several reasons, including the poor quality of clinical samples, the gap between subjective clinical definition of a disease and objective protein measurements, and high false discovery rate of differentially expressed proteins identified in the initial discovery phase (Rifai N, Gillette MA, Carr SA. Nat Biotechnol 24:971-983, 2006). It has become clear that the vast majority of differentially expressed proteins identified in the discovery phase will ultimately fail as useful clinical biomarkers, and only few true positive candidates can move through the biomarker development pipeline. Isolation of true biomarkers from the large pool of differentially expressed proteins identified in the discovery phase becomes the greatest challenge and the bottleneck in most biomarker pipelines. To succeed, after the initial discovery study (see Chap. 20 ), the authenticity of biomarker candidates need to be tested in a pilot study with high throughput, high accuracy and reasonable cost. This essential process is addressed by qualification and verification phase of the biomarker development pipeline.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yingxin Zhao"", ids = ""2818173""); list(name = ""Allan R.

e0ee9c7d71ea09a5820041dd7ed1de47f987b0ef,Altered Executive Function in Pre-Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"BACKGROUND
For the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is increasing interest in pre-mild cognitive impairment (pre-MCI).


OBJECTIVE
We explored the neuropsychological characteristics in a group of pre-MCI and cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals, with the aim of providing measures sensitive to cognitive change in pre-MCI.


METHODS
We included 188 CN elderly and 77 individuals with pre-MCI. All participants underwent comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment. We compared 17 cognitive tests between the CN and pre-MCI groups by using one-way ANOVAs with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. Pearson's correlations were also obtained between episodic memory and executive function tests in the pre-MCI group.


RESULTS
The pre-MCI group showed significantly lower scores for visual immediate recall, fluency tests, and Stroop color naming in the color-word incongruent condition than the CN group (pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). Most of these executive function measures were significantly correlated with episodic memory (pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). There were no significant group-differences in other tests assessing attention, verbal memory, visuospatial ability, and language.


CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate that poor executive function especially demanding inhibition and goal-directed behaviors within time limit could be the characteristics of the very early cognitive sign in the course of AD.",2016,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eun Hyun Seo"", ids = ""5124794""); list(name = ""Hoowon Kim"", ids = ""8186196""); list(name = ""Kun Ho Lee"", ids = ""2151415""); list(name = ""Il Han Choo"", ids = ""4200847"")",0349d33f5dc2aba84b7f562bf31351e02309369b; f6dce18d7aa0e5215a226ffb89336cf4496f2975; b672ff1cee257ea6880ed19cf2ac9c3cb4433aab; ef3406ca7c4797b74b9e4164de6719cbe93ac0ea; 343ffae8056a9267f60a13397b36fa5245dbe518; d11b74abda0ec0b80978085dd784f550b0f7a204; 91f91dae703511c024d248d3d057b486b00c674c; 04745b502da35024a33c2fd0028c81bb090211cf; 9ab4d40477e51daafbe96403527759851c5b0257; f9b10acd336cef353648a05c34385cf1e1f132fd; 04ae0ea271202b1001ed4ed08039f9e60d9f1880,,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,54 3,"

ed7110227d3733a9379e8930ab5a72b64b5e1511,Functional proteomics characterization of residual triple-negative breast cancer after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND
In this study, we used functional proteomics to determine the molecular characteristics of residual triple receptor-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients after neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (NCT) and their relationship with patient outcomes in order to identify potential targets for therapy.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Protein was extracted from 54 residual TNBCs, and 76 proteins related to breast cancer signaling were measured by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPAs). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for each protein. Survival outcomes were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Training and cross validation were carried out. The coefficients estimated from the multivariable Cox model were used to calculate a risk score (RS) for each sample.


RESULTS
Multivariable analysis using the top 25 proteins from univariable analysis at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.3 showed that AKT, IGFBP2, LKB1, S6 and Stathmin were predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS). The cross-validation model was reproducible. The RS model calculated based on the multivariable analysis was -1.1086 Ã— AKT + 0.2501 Ã— IGFBP2 - 0.6745 Ã— LKB1+1.0692 Ã— S6 + 1.4086 Ã— stathmin with a corresponding area under the curve, AUC = 0.856. The RS was an independent predictor of RFS (HR = 3.28, 95%CI = 2.07-5.20, P < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
We found a five-protein model that independently predicted RFS risk in patients with residual TNBC disease.

Virus-vector coevolution may potentially influence vector gene expression to prolong viral association and thus increase virus transmission efficiency and spread. To understand the transcriptomic responses of WCM to WSMV, RNA sequencing was performed to assemble and analyse transcriptomes of WSMV viruliferous and aviruliferous mites. Among 7291 de novo-assembled unigenes, 1020 were differentially expressed between viruliferous and aviruliferous WCMs using edgeR at a false discovery rate â‰¤0.05. Differentially expressed unigenes were enriched for 108 gene ontology terms, with the majority of the unigenes showing downregulation in viruliferous mites in comparison to only a few unigenes that were upregulated. Protein family and metabolic pathway enrichment analyses revealed that most downregulated unigenes encoded enzymes and proteins linked to stress response, immunity and development. Mechanistically, these predicted changes in mite physiology induced by viral association could be suggestive of pathways needed for promoting virus-vector interactions. Overall, our data suggest that transcriptional changes in viruliferous mites facilitate prolonged viral association and alter WCM development to expedite population expansion, both of which could enhance viral transmission.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Adarsh K.

The molecular alterations associated with this racial disparity have not been fully elucidated. We aim to compare the expression profile of AA and CA men using microarray available data and paraffin-embedded tissues to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the disproportionate of PCa among AA men. Methods: Microarray data of 619 PCa patients, 412 AA and 207 CA, were retrieved from 11 data sets deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. False discovery rates (FDR) were used for reporting differentially expressed genes and the differentially regulated pathways of these genes were predicted. To validate the microarray data, qPCR analyses were performed in forty paraffin-embedded samples collected from AA and CA men. Results: Of 362 differential transcripts of array data, TIMP4, LTC4S, SHH, ADIPOQ, and ALOX12 were downregulated (p Conclusions: Gene expression data from PCa specimens and microarray suggest that dysregulation of transcripts in PCa of AA compared to CA men may underlie health disparity of PCa.

First, we aimed to identify a nasal gene expression profile that distinguishes COPD patients from healthy controls. Next, we investigated whether this COPD-associated gene expression profile in nasal epithelium is comparable with the profile in the lower airways, i.e. the bronchial epithelium. Methods: Genome wide gene expression analysis was performed on nasal epithelial brushes of 76 COPD patients and 39 healthy controls, using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. To compare findings in nasal and bronchial epithelium, we repeated the gene expression analysis on bronchial epithelial brushes in 2 independent cohorts of COPD patients and controls. Results: We found 2673 genes to be significantly differentially expressed in nasal epithelium between COPD patients and controls, 1158 being up- and 1515 downregulated in COPD (false discovery rate Conclusion: We identified a nasal gene expression profile that differentiates individuals with and without COPD.

Yet, there are instances when application of a non-specific protease is desirable to obtain sufficient sequence coverage of otherwise poorly accessible proteins or structural domains. Using the non-specific protease, proteinase K, we analyzed Saccharomyces cerevisiae preparations grown in (14)N rich media and (15)N minimal media and obtained relative quantitation from the dataset using normalized spectral abundance factors (NSAFs). A critical step in using a spectral counting based approach for quantitative proteomics is ensuring the inclusion of high quality spectra in the dataset. One way to do this is to minimize the false discovery rate, which can be accomplished by applying different filters to a searched dataset.

ceba0bff5d41c6aa7d94d545e6558f38e7566442,Evaluation of Associations between Genetically Predicted Circulating Protein Biomarkers and Breast Cancer Risk.,"A small number of circulating proteins have been reported to be associated with breast cancer risk, with inconsistent results. Herein, we attempted to identify novel protein biomarkers for breast cancer via the integration of genomics and proteomics data. In the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), with 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European descendants, we evaluated the associations of the genetically predicted concentrations of >1,400 circulating proteins with breast cancer risk. We used data from a large-scale protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis as our study instrument. Summary statistics for these pQTL variants related to breast cancer risk were obtained from the BCAC and used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for each protein using the inverse-variance weighted method. We identified 56 proteins significantly associated with breast cancer risk by instrumental analysis (false discovery rate < 0.05). Of these, the concentrations of 32 were influenced by variants close to a breast cancer susceptibility locus (ABO, 9q34.2). Many of these proteins, such as insulin receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 and other membrane receptors (OR: 0.82 to 1.18, P values: 6.96Ã—10-4 to 3.28Ã—10-8 ), are linked to insulin resistance and estrogen receptor signaling pathways. Proteins identified at other loci include those involved in biological processes such as alcohol and lipid metabolism, proteolysis, apoptosis, immune regulation, and cell motility and proliferation. Consistent associations were observed for 22 proteins in the UK Biobank data (P < 0.05). The study identifies potential novel biomarkers for breast cancer, but further investigation is needed to replicate our findings. This article is protected by copyright.

dd14c2f3cdabee1abddf67001292ccef80792fa3,Gene Expression Profiling of Blood in Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms: in Search of Biomarkers,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the systemic response to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RAs) are not fully understood. We investigated whether the analysis of gene expression in peripheral blood could provide clinically relevant information regarding the biologic consequences of SAH. Transcriptomics were performed using Illumina HumanHT-12v4 microarrays for 43 RA patients and 18 controls (C). Differentially expressed transcripts were analyzed for overrepresented functional groups and blood cell type-specific gene expression. The set of differentially expressed transcripts was validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in an independent group of subjects (15 RA patients and 14 C). There were 135 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate â‰¤1%, absolute fold change â‰¤1.7): the abundant levels of 78 mRNAs increased and 57 mRNAs decreased. Among RA patients, transcripts specific to T lymphocyte subpopulations were downregulated, whereas those related to monocytes and neutrophils were upregulated. Expression profiles of a set of 16 genes and lymphocyte-to-monocyte-and-neutrophil gene expression ratios distinguished RA patients from C. These results indicate that SAH from RAs strongly influences the transcription profiles of blood cells. A specific pattern of these changes suggests suppression in lymphocyte response and enhancements in monocyte and neutrophil activities. This is probably related to the immunodepression observed in SAH.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joanna Pera"", ids = ""5283514""); list(name = ""MichaÅ‚ KorostyÅ„ski"", ids = ""4112840""); list(name = ""SÅ‚awomir GoÅ‚da"", ids = ""4453118""); list(name = ""Marcin Piechota"", ids = ""3362055""); list(name = ""Jaroslaw Dzbek"", ids = ""5529471""); list(name = ""Tadeusz Krzyszkowski"", ids = ""7727198""); list(name = ""Tomasz Dziedzic"", ids = ""49582033""); list(name = ""Marek M.

5b54f020b5403497e7455640c4615e4621700b53,High-resolution detection of identity by descent in unrelated individuals.,"Detection of recent identity by descent (IBD) in population samples is important for population-based linkage mapping and for highly accurate genotype imputation and haplotype-phase inference. We present a method for detection of recent IBD in population samples. Our method accounts for linkage disequilibrium between SNPs to enable full use of high-density SNP data. We find that our method can detect segments of a length of 2 cM with moderate power and negligible false discovery rate in Illumina 550K data in Northwestern Europeans. We compare our method with GERMLINE and PLINK, and we show that our method has a level of resolution that is significantly better than these existing methods, thus extending the usefulness of recent IBD in analysis of high-density SNP data. We survey four genomic regions in a sample of UK individuals of European descent and find that on average, at a given location, our method detects IBD in 2.7 per 10,000 pairs of individuals in Illumina 550K data. We also present methodology and results for detection of homozygosity by descent (HBD) and survey the whole genome in a sample of 1373 UK individuals of European descent. We detect HBD in 4.7 individuals per 10,000 on average at a given location.

b81204817105f1d0039b6b49f4cc9bda5c76286a,Exploring the interaction between SNP genotype and postmenopausal hormone therapy effects on stroke risk,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies have identified several genomic regions that are associated with stroke risk, but these provide an explanation for only a small fraction of familial stroke aggregation. Genotype by environment interactions may contribute further to such an explanation. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial found increased stroke risk with postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and provides an efficient setting for evaluating genotype-HT interaction on stroke risk.MethodsWe examined HT by genotype interactions for 392 SNPs selected from candidate gene studies, and 2,371 SNPs associated with changes in blood protein concentrations after hormone therapy, in analyses that included 2,045 postmenopausal women who developed stroke during WHI clinical trial and observational study follow-up and one-to-one matched controls. A two-stage procedure was implemented where SNPs passing the first stage screening based on marginal association with stroke risk were tested in the second stage for interaction with HT using case-only analysis.ResultsThe two-stage procedure identified two SNPs, rs2154299 and rs12194855, in the coagulation factor XIII subunit A (F13A1) region and two SNPs, rs630431 and rs560892, in the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) region, with an estimated false discovery rate <0.05 based on interaction tests. Further analyses showed significant stroke risk interaction between these F13A1 SNPs and estrogen plus progestin (E+P) treatment for ischemic stroke and for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke combined, and suggested interactions between PCSK9 SNPs with either E+P or estrogen-alone treatment.ConclusionsGenotype by environment interaction information may help to define genomic regions relevant to stroke risk. Two-stage analysis among postmenopausal women generates novel hypotheses concerning the F13A1 and PCSK9 genomic regions and the effects of hormonal exposures on postmenopausal stroke risk for subsequent independent validation.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying Huang"", ids = ""48356004""); list(name = ""Dennis G.

bcae9ca3e8a2519fa1a4283c98436bdace9f4a69,Abstract LB-25: Exploration of genome-wide circulating microRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - dysregulation of miR-483-5p and miR-150 as diagnostic marker.,"Proceedings: AACR 104th Annual Meeting 2013; Apr 6-10, 2013; Washington, DC

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has doubled over the past 20 years in the United States (US). HCC prognosis is poor if not diagnosed and treated at an early stage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression by inhibiting translation or inducing cleavage of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). miRNAs can regulate diverse biological processes including DNA repair, apoptosis, cell proliferation, differentiation and immune function. Circulating miRNAs in cell-free plasma/serum samples have been consistently observed to have high stability and resistance to storage/handling, suggesting their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers. We conducted a two-phase epidemiological case-control study to test the hypothesis that genome-wide dysregulation of circulating miRNAs differentiate HCC cases from controls. A total of 69 HCC patients and 69 controls were recruited and matched on age, gender and ethnicity. Taqman low density arrays were used to examine genome-wide miRNA expression, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate promising candidates. Sixty-six miRNAs were found to be significantly over-expressed in plasma of HCC cases compared to controls after adjusting for false discovery rate (p<0.05). A volcano plot indicated that 7 miRNAs had over 2-fold case-control differences with p<0.01. Four significant miRNAs (miR-150, miR-30c, miR-483-5p and miR-520b) detectable in all samples with varied expression levels were further validated in an expanded case-control study. MiR-483-5p was statistically significantly over-expressed in HCC cases compared with controls (3.25 vs. 0.54, p<0.0001). MiR-150 was up-regulated in HCC, but the difference was not significant (5.66 vs. 5.29). The combination of plasma levels of miR-483-5p and miR-150 can significantly differentiate HCC cases from controls with an AUC of 0.850 (p<0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.8% and 85.5%. These preliminary data indicated the importance of dysregulated circulating miRNAs in hepatocarcinogenesis, and suggesting the possibility of using miR-483-5p and miR-150 as diagnostic biomarkers. Large prospective studies are necessary to replicate the current findings, and evaluate the panel of circulating miRNAs in improving early diagnosis of HCC.

Our main contribution is to derive a precise non-asymptotic tradeoff between FNR and FDR for a variant of the generalized Gaussian sequence model. Our analysis is flexible enough to permit analyses of settings where the problem parameters vary with the number of hypotheses $n$, including various sparse and dense regimes (with $o(n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ signals).

9908ee9ead0dd0b310c42783140d05b7aead2467,C06 Phenor: data exploration for automated homecage system,"Background Automated behavioural assessment is gaining a greater presence in the field of neurodegenerative disease research. It provides objectivity and a wide scope of uses in phenotyping but conversely presents difficulties due to the very advantages it presents: mainly, that the researcher is presented with a large amount of data which must be collated, prepared, explored and tested. Manual preparation of this data can also increase the risk of mistakes and thus decrease the reliability of results. Aims In order to facilitate the exploration and analysis of data produced by the Labmaster and Phenomaster automated homecage system (TSE Systems), we undertook to create a system that would aggregate and process the raw data produced, present the results in an intuitive and visual manner to aid discovery and provide some additional tools to facilitate data analysis. Methods The R Statistics software (R Development Core Team (2009)) was used to create a script to provide all the processing and analysis functions. For our analysis, we limited the variables analysed from the homecage output since not all are relevant or are coincide with the observations of other variables. Where inferential tests were applied, we used False Discovery Rate to adjust for multiple testing. The Manipulate package was used to give interactive functionality and the PLS package provided functions for partial least square regression. Outcome The script we generated was able to produce the necessary aggregation and reduction of data from the csv files containing raw Labmaster/Phenomaster data, automatically adjusting for occasions when the metabolic attachment was present. The amount of time necessary to prepare, graph and export data was greatly reduced, while facilitating exploration of the data by use of multivariate analysis. We illustrate the outcomes from this analysis method with results from different rodent models of HD and HD-like diseases and experiments.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Esteban Portal"", ids = ""6291138""); list(name = ""Hhp Nguyen"", ids = ""122619202"")",,,"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry",83,
63d4ebde59a99f617b69fcea54f016dbbda1815b,Comparison of four MRI protocols for detection of extrahepatic colorectal cancer metastases,"PURPOSE
To compare three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols containing diffusion-weighted imaging with background suppression (DWIBS) and one traditional protocol for detecting extrahepatic colorectal cancer metastases.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty patients with extrahepatic colorectal cancer metastases were scanned in three stations from the skull base to the upper thighs using a 1.5T MRI system with six different MRI sequences; transverse and coronal T2 -weighted (T2 W) turbo spin-echo (TSE), coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR), 3D T1 W TSE, DWIBS, and a contrast-enhanced T1 W 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence. The six sequences were used to build four hypothetical MRI interpretive sets which were read by two readers in consensus, blinded to prior imaging. Lesions were categorized into 13 anatomic regions. Fluorodeoxyglucose / positron emission tomography / computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) read with full access to prior imaging and clinical records was used as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and false discovery rate (FDR) were calculated as appropriate and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed.


RESULTS
In all, 177 malignant lesions were detected by FDG-PET/CT and distributed in 92 out of 390 scanned anatomic regions. The sensitivity was statistically higher in two out of three sets incorporating DWIBS on a per-lesion basis (66.7%, 63.3%, and 66.7% vs. 57.6%) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.11, and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, respectively) and in all sets incorporating DWIBS on a per-region basis (75.0%, 75.0%, and 77.2 vs. 66.3%) (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04, and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.01, respectively). There was no difference in specificity, FDR, or AUCROC . There was no difference between sets containing DWIBS irrespective of the use of a contrast-enhanced sequence.


CONCLUSION
MRI sets containing DWIBS had superior sensitivity. This sensitivity was retained when omitting a contrast-enhanced sequence.

The aim of this study was to assess if there is a correlation between change in body weight over time and gut microbiome composition.Methods:We analysed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence data derived from the faecal samples of 1632 healthy females from TwinsUK to investigate the association between gut microbiome measured cross-sectionally and longitudinal weight gain (adjusted for caloric intake and baseline body mass index). Dietary fibre intake was investigated as a possible modifier.Results:Less than half of the variation in long-term weight change was found to be heritable (h2=0.41 (0.31, 0.47)). Gut microbiota diversity was negatively associated with long-term weight gain, whereas it was positively correlated with fibre intake. Nine bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were significantly associated with weight gain after adjusting for covariates, family relatedness and multiple testing (false discovery rate <0.05). OTUs associated with lower long-term weight gain included those assigned to Ruminococcaceae (associated in mice with improved energy metabolism) and Lachnospiraceae.

Chromosome substitution strains: some quantitative considerations for genome scans and fine mapping
","A chromosome substitution strain (CSS) is an inbred strain in which one chromosome has been substituted from a different inbred strain by repeated backcrossing. A complete CSS set has one strain representing each chromosome against a uniform background, thus allowing genome-wide scans to be carried out for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing any trait of interest. A one-way ANOVA by strain is first carried out, followed by planned comparisons using Dunnettâ€™s method. A QTL is detected and mapped to a chromosome when a significant difference is observed in a background strain vs CSS comparison. The most efficient ratio of background to CSS mice in any one comparison is 4.5:1, and the threshold for p < .05 genome-wide significance is estimated to be p = .003 to .004, a much less stringent criterion than any other mammalian mapping population. The use of false discovery rates tends to further reduce threshold stringency. Comparisons are made to the widely used conventional F2 intercross, and both advantages and disadvantages are noted. The proportion of the trait variance due to a QTL is often much larger than the same QTL in an F2, and the number of generations to attain fine mapping is greatly reduced. To serve as guidelines for planning experiments, methods to estimate sample sizes for QTL detection are presented for the initial genome scan and for subsequent fine mapping.",2003,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John K.

299ffc54f970ea98afdec59025badb709294052b,No Association of nineteenCOX-2 gene variants to preclinical markers of atherosclerosis The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study,"BackgroudThe role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) single nucleotide polymorphisms has mostly been studied in relation to advanced atherosclerosis, but little is known how they contribute to preclinical disease. In the present study we analyzed whether COX-2 gene variants associate independently with the early subclinical markers of atherosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness and carotid artery distensibility in a population of young healthy Caucasian adults.MethodsSNPs for association analysis were collected from the COX-2 gene and 5â€‰kb up- and downstream of it. There were 19 SNPs available for analysis, four genotyped and fifteen imputed. Genotype data was available for 2442 individuals participating in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Genotype imputation was performed using MACH 1.0 and HapMap II CEU (release 22) samples as reference. Association analysis was performed using linear regression with an additive model. PLINK was used for true genotyped SNPs and ProbABEL for imputed genotype dosages. False discovery rate was used to take into account multiple testing bias.ResultsTwo of the COX-2 variants (rs689470, rs689462) associated with distensibility (pâ€‰=â€‰0.005) under the linear regression additive model. After adjustment with gender, age, body mass index and smoking status, association between these SNPs and distensibility remained significant (pâ€‰=â€‰0.031). Subjects carrying the minor alleles had higher value of carotid artery distensibility compared to the major allele homozygotes. However, after correcting p-values for multiple testing bias using false discovery rate, association was lost. Another COX-2 variant rs4648261 associated with mean carotid intima-media thickness (pâ€‰=â€‰0.046) and maximal carotid intima-media thickness (pâ€‰=â€‰0.048) in the linear regression model. Subjects carrying the minor allele of rs4648261 had lower values of mean and maximal carotid intima-media thickness compared to subjects homozygote for major allele. After adjustments the associations were lost with both mean and maximal carotid intima-media thickness. Thus, no statistically significant associations of the studied COX-2 variants with carotid artery distensibility or carotid intima-media thickness were found.ConclusionsOur results suggest that in a Finnish population, there are no significant associations between COX-2 variants and early atherosclerotic changes in young adulthood.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kati H LÃ¤hteelÃ¤"", ids = ""5192452""); list(name = ""Tarja A.

facc6ce103cd45115472aa6ca4721fc6e9161242,No evidence for systematic white matter correlates of dyslexia: An Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis,"Dyslexia is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by reading and spelling difficulties. Beyond the behavioral and functional correlates of this condition, a growing number of studies have explored structural differences between individuals with dyslexia and typically developing individuals. To date, findings remain disparate - some studies suggest differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect measure of white matter integrity, whereas others do not identify significant disparities. Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of dyslexia via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of profound, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David Moreau"", ids = ""72717606""); list(name = ""Josephine E.

60e78a8889f51c0c580f852b9b8a26091fcb42fe,A genome-wide association study of brain lesion distribution in multiple sclerosis.,"Brain magnetic resonance imaging is widely used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool in multiple sclerosis and provides a non-invasive, sensitive and reproducible way to track the disease. Topological characteristics relating to the distribution and shape of lesions are recognized as important neuroradiological markers in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, although these have been much less well characterized quantitatively than have traditional measures such as T2 hyperintense or T1 hypointense lesion volumes. Here, we used voxel-level 3 T magnetic resonance imaging T1-weighted scans to reconstruct the 3D topology of lesions in 284 subjects with multiple sclerosis and tested whether this is a heritable phenotype. To this end, we extracted the genotypes from a published genome-wide association study on these same individuals and searched for genetic associations with lesion load, shape and topological distribution. Lesion probability maps were created to identify frequently affected areas and to assess the overall distribution of T1 lesions in the subject population as a whole. We then developed an original algorithm to cluster adjacent lesional voxels (cluxels) in each subject and tested whether cluxel topology was significantly associated with any single-nucleotide polymorphism in our data set. To focus on patterns of lesion distribution, we computed the first 10 principal components. Although principal component 1 correlated with lesion load, none of the remaining orthogonal components correlated with any other known variable. We then conducted genome-wide association studies on each of these and found 31 significant associations (false discovery rate <0.01) with principal component 8, which represents a mode of variation of lesion topology in the population. The majority of the loci can be linked to genes related to immune cell function and to myelin and neural growth; some (SYK, MYT1L, TRAPPC9, SLITKR6 and RIC3) have been previously associated with the distribution of white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis. Finally, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify a network of 48 interacting proteins showing genetic associations (P < 0.01) with cluxel topology in multiple sclerosis. This network also contains proteins expressed in immune cells and is enriched in molecules expressed in the central nervous system that contribute to neural development and regeneration. Our results show how quantitative traits derived from brain magnetic resonance images of patients with multiple sclerosis can be used as dependent variables in a genome-wide association study.

505672c2b9043af77ff21c51d8eb0ea205848479,A Bayesian Spatial Model for Imaging Genetics,"In this paper we develop a Bayesian bivariate spatial group lasso model for multivariate regression analysis applicable to studies examining the influence of genetic variation on brain structure. Our model is motivated by an imaging genetics study of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), where the objective is to examine the association between images of volumetric and cortical thickness values summarizing the structure of the brain as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a set of 486 SNPs from 33 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) candidate genes obtained from 632 subjects. A bivariate spatial process model is developed to accommodate the correlation structures typically seen in structural brain imaging data. First, we allow for spatial correlation in the imaging phenotypes obtained from neighbouring regions on the same hemisphere of the brain. Second, we allow for correlation in the same phenotypes obtained from different hemispheres (left/right) of the brain. To do this we employ a proper bivariate conditional autoregressive spatial model for the errors in a bivariate spatial regression model. In addition to spatial correlation, we encourage sparsity in the regression coefficients relating each SNP to the brain imaging phenotypes by assigning a group lasso prior and using the corresponding Gaussian scale-mixture representation to facilitate computation. Two approaches are developed for Bayesian computation: (i) a mean-field variational Bayes algorithm and (ii) a Gibbs sampling algorithm. In addition to developing the spatial model and computational procedures to approximate the posterior distribution, we also incorporate Bayesian false discovery rate (FDR) procedures to select SNPs. We implement the new model, the new algorithms, and Bayesian FDR for this model in a new a release of the R package bgsmtr for imaging genetics.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yin Song"", ids = ""2537977""); list(name = ""Shufei Ge"", ids = ""51231525""); list(name = ""Jiguo Cao"", ids = ""50492056""); list(name = ""Liangliang Wang"", ids = ""144082568""); list(name = ""Farouk S.

193209db2e852727bcd7c5919887db92977971c8,Detection Theory in Identification of RNA-DNA Sequence Differences Using RNA-Sequencing,"Advances in sequencing technology have allowed for detailed analyses of the transcriptome at single-nucleotide resolution, facilitating the study of RNA editing or sequence differences between RNA and DNA genome-wide. In humans, two types of post-transcriptional RNA editing processes are known to occur: A-to-I deamination by ADAR and C-to-U deamination by APOBEC1. In addition to these sequence differences, researchers have reported the existence of all 12 types of RNA-DNA sequence differences (RDDs); however, the validity of these claims is debated, as many studies claim that technical artifacts account for the majority of these non-canonical sequence differences. In this study, we used a detection theory approach to evaluate the performance of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and associated aligners in accurately identifying RNA-DNA sequence differences. By generating simulated RNA-Seq datasets containing RDDs, we assessed the effect of alignment artifacts and sequencing error on the sensitivity and false discovery rate of RDD detection. Overall, we found that even in the presence of sequencing errors, false negative and false discovery rates of RDD detection can be contained below 10% with relatively lenient thresholds. We also assessed the ability of various filters to target false positive RDDs and found them to be effective in discriminating between true and false positives. Lastly, we used the optimal thresholds we identified from our simulated analyses to identify RDDs in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. We found approximately 6,000 RDDs, the majority of which are A-to-G edits and likely to be mediated by ADAR. Moreover, we found the majority of non A-to-G RDDs to be associated with poorer alignments and conclude from these results that the evidence for widespread non-canonical RDDs in humans is weak. Overall, we found RNA-Seq to be a powerful technique for surveying RDDs genome-wide when coupled with the appropriate thresholds and filters.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jonathan M.

b8f4d35dc8db4d76d046e69b7c46093dd51a1506,Multiple hypothesis testing strategies for genetic case-control association studies.,"The genetic case-control association study of unrelated subjects is a leading method to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNP haplotypes that modulate the risk of complex diseases. Association studies often genotype several SNPs in a number of candidate genes; we propose a two-stage approach to address the inherent statistical multiple comparisons problem. In the first stage, each gene's association with disease is summarized by a single p-value that controls a familywise error rate. In the second stage, summary p-values are adjusted for multiplicity using a false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure. For the first stage, we consider marginal and joint tests of SNPs and haplotypes within genes, and we construct an omnibus test that combines SNP and haplotype analysis. Simulation studies show that when disease susceptibility is conferred by a SNP, and all common SNPs in a gene are genotyped, marginal analysis of SNPs using the Simes test has similar or higher power than marginal or joint haplotype analysis. Conversely, haplotype analysis can be more powerful when disease susceptibility is conferred by a haplotype. The omnibus test tracks the more powerful of the two approaches, which is generally unknown. Multiple testing balances the desire for statistical power against the implicit costs of false positive results, which up to now appear to be common in the literature.",2006,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Philip S Rosenberg"", ids = ""35272929""); list(name = ""Anney Che"", ids = ""2285606""); list(name = ""Bingshu E.

In this paper, we evaluated the possible role of BDNF as a moderator of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the context of different socioeconomic classes. We genotyped ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around BDNF in 229 families and evaluate whether there are SNP-by-socioeconomic status (SES) interactions for attention deficit hyperactivity. We developed three quantitative phenotypes for ADHD from nine inattentive and nine hyperactive-impulsive symptoms that were used in SNP-by-SES interaction analyses using a new methodology implemented in the computer program PBAT. Findings were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. We found multiple significant SNP-by-SES interactions using the inattentive symptom count. This study suggests that different SES classes may modify the effect of the functional variant(s) in and around BDNF to have an impact on the number of ADHD symptom counts that are observed. The two exons within BDNF represent potential functional variants that may be causing the observed associations.",2007,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jessica Laskyâ\200\220Su"", ids = ""1422266107""); list(name = ""Stephen V.

43114a13b0d49c74ecf9d6636801630f7fc9591f,Natural tolerance development in cow's milk allergic children: IgE and IgG4 epitope binding,"BACKGROUND
Although most of cow's milk (CM) allergic children will outgrow their allergy, the pathomechanism of the natural development of tolerance remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that the balance between milk-specific IgE and IgG4 plays a major role.


OBJECTIVE
We aimed to investigate differences in IgE and IgG4 antibody binding to CM epitopes between patients with persistent CM allergy (CMA) and those that naturally became tolerant.


METHODS
Sera from 35 children with proven CMA (median age at inclusion of 10Â months) were analyzed retrospectively; 22 patients have become tolerant (median age at tolerance acquisition of 51Â months) during the study period as confirmed by a negative oral food challenge. IgE and IgG4 binding to sequential epitopes derived from five major CM proteins were measured with a peptide microarray-based immunoassay.


RESULTS
At baselines, greater intensity and broader diversity of IgE and IgG4 binding have been found in children with persistent CMA beyond 5Â years of age compared to patients with transient CMA. Moreover, children with transient CMA had IgE and IgG4 antibodies that more often recognized the same epitopes, compared to those with persistent CMA. From baseline to the time of tolerance development, both IgE and IgG4 binding intensity decreased significantly, particularly in areas of Î±-s- and Î²-casein (P<.01, false discovery rate [FDR]<.1). Interestingly, differences between IgE and IgG4 binding intensity to CM peptides decreased when the patients became tolerant.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that the overlap between IgE and IgG4 might be important in natural tolerance acquisition. Further studies are needed to confirm our data and can eventually lead to development of more targeted treatment of food allergy.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""J C Caubet"", ids = ""153001303""); list(name = ""Jing Lin"", ids = ""143922198""); list(name = ""Birgit Ahrens"", ids = ""49363286""); list(name = ""Gustavo Javier GimÃ©nez"", ids = ""38394249""); list(name = ""Ludmilla Bardina"", ids = ""4631570""); list(name = ""Bodo Niggemann"", ids = ""6395783""); list(name = ""Hugh A Sampson"", ids = ""5022184""); list(name = ""Kirsten Beyer"", ids = ""1791228"")",1527f98dd234471dbf838d88ddb27de25df3d931; b801724f9211bbbd5f9112a9e245396885854d3b; 76a4fbae6b721adbf1a958b65b58568badb18aeb; 1f441f423d2fcd3e84464fcf31fc149724e99917; 40e6b7eadd750f53981d5250c2590ba1ad7bc1f1; f0d20db0b25ab7f86d8f91cc941df430929c1ab1; 31c8cf8f8e3320c62431ca3218e0f39527c650b7; 598f5391bad7a224ebfdcc5b2a0a6fa4aac4d2ad,240a453ce2d7b5c1256c9177c8843731a1b19097; a6477b5725cd615942ecc4f7b0b9f9772e45d12f; 27316a81df3a2f90d76831081b73022a8ef74def; 725b5c03ae344f7732c659759c47152f6e07beb8; b07bd764e2e8ef385aed7acc37da2cb80057d111; 5b230a36220c9136f4d8b9a9bb2b482c2764aee3; 499a299c84b9cd27d97ffec1a091c1cf51ee65d1; ccb096ef4f8df515f98f0ea82de4b5357d730ca3; 8a6ebedcb05499ac5890f1d9422bf1fc2004dd22; 92d4d2a4cbee46877b064d33caba9355b51b5f1e; 480fcff71f022ca0e7af2b78f0241ff1ada2fed2; cafd0bd94d3fea02aaeb5a8ea68668444cedbcee; 34d6c8710a17a17415671cc231203e8da9f131fc; 583974780a67a8f031a1d88af750151135ff003a; e09e4c4f6b7c3673aa7196b1d22472db102838a2; c543e7de4593ee0f56083aff024b01115d9f011f; 426d32ece4b8650d63c0aa2d43dbd93d10c8679d; bb06e777bb0ae9fb337247cd927ffc791eca83d3; 7b7c64ef366b0aabbefebfde744ddda9a48bdf65; 54c91d291adf9051869dcdb8803d95f2bdc0398f; 834e40d76b74571160ffd1b43be04f16d6864877; c155b9b2d8d70ccc8a77be4b74b5d3a110d4b0ed; 5955dbea7d31c16552ba70ac8ec84c502b5d6fc9; c79ebb678ce5bb8c36d4accaa06bdf4df090b9bb; 1d5489b357297aac9c7720a213d27f5597c3a04f; d2283a7f469a0ee863be8c230b4688dc1bad01cd; 57ac957954ded4ec3efd89d621aadd51a3e3713e; dacbba927ad32343b930b2554204fedcb1cb8bca; d2d052ff8c0117171d6c717c31a50ad0759aa382,Allergy,72,1677â€“1685
198b2f81d45aaccc478e775e410f984ab2eea785,Partitioning heritability analysis reveals a shared genetic basis of brain anatomy and schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex genetic etiology. Widespread cortical gray matter loss has been observed in patients and prodromal samples. However, it remains unresolved whether schizophrenia-associated cortical structure variations arise due to disease etiology or secondary to the illness. Here we address this question using a partitioning-based heritability analysis of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and neuroimaging data from 1750 healthy individuals. We find that schizophrenia-associated genetic variants explain a significantly enriched proportion of trait heritability in eight brain phenotypes (false discovery rate=10%). In particular, intracranial volume and left superior frontal gyrus thickness exhibit significant and robust associations with schizophrenia genetic risk under varying SNP selection conditions. Cross-disorder comparison suggests that the neurogenetic architecture of schizophrenia-associated brain regions is, at least in part, shared with other psychiatric disorders. Our study highlights key neuroanatomical correlates of schizophrenia genetic risk in the general population. These may provide fundamental insights into the complex pathophysiology of the illness, and a potential link to neurocognitive deficits shaping the disorder.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Phil H.

4afd91c9d0d644451e5058218662a2a7d7c0cb6c,Correlation set analysis: detecting active regulators in disease populations using prior causal knowledge,"BackgroundIdentification of active causal regulators is a crucial problem in understanding mechanism of diseases or finding drug targets. Methods that infer causal regulators directly from primary data have been proposed and successfully validated in some cases. These methods necessarily require very large sample sizes or a mix of different data types. Recent studies have shown that prior biological knowledge can successfully boost a method's ability to find regulators.ResultsWe present a simple data-driven method, Correlation Set Analysis (CSA), for comprehensively detecting active regulators in disease populations by integrating co-expression analysis and a specific type of literature-derived causal relationships. Instead of investigating the co-expression level between regulators and their regulatees, we focus on coherence of regulatees of a regulator. Using simulated datasets we show that our method performs very well at recovering even weak regulatory relationships with a low false discovery rate. Using three separate real biological datasets we were able to recover well known and as yet undescribed, active regulators for each disease population. The results are represented as a rank-ordered list of regulators, and reveals both single and higher-order regulatory relationships.ConclusionsCSA is an intuitive data-driven way of selecting directed perturbation experiments that are relevant to a disease population of interest and represent a starting point for further investigation. Our findings demonstrate that combining co-expression analysis on regulatee sets with a literature-derived network can successfully identify causal regulators and help develop possible hypothesis to explain disease progression.",2011,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chia-Ling Huang"", ids = ""1781139""); list(name = ""John Lamb"", ids = ""144682602""); list(name = ""Leonid Chindelevitch"", ids = ""2967774""); list(name = ""Jarek Kostrowicki"", ids = ""35032725""); list(name = ""Justin Guinney"", ids = ""1684985""); list(name = ""Charles DeLisi"", ids = ""1722297""); list(name = ""Daniel Ziemek"", ids = ""2119112"")",d302af470dcb93b739104ba7ae4c6757f89cf0ab; ab9cd8d0eac59e5bd9cd2a76bd2fd0614cc3398b; 1fbc6f32e22e7421204015f958d2528a160a6634; 2455147a715eedc991fc86366489967b04728243; d7e1324a0d0206a996892d3544ff4a1d36babc0c; 4afd91c9d0d644451e5058218662a2a7d7c0cb6c,31f10d03396e306741141069055e652c3bf3247b; 196e5afb0cd2ca0383773f3332445d1056cdd93a; 571356fb0821f43ed3ceb0b45bf122a34eed3b25; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 96d67e993e58ae60d60448a689a4513243e14689; e8ed956ce6a454ffb74a915f02280799eb1f133a; 93854375bfa89fdeee804f4c9aaa686c9211241d; 6075227fc5ffe5af7e1c761b90c8747182e2b66c; b0222597a51787fdaf168f849e1d7d56aa72b937; dcb208468a9d53911879d5b3835aaeaa5ef7ee6c; d1b2996bdbbe2a643f6ba187938d6b921464a17f; 8d1f074027a821552fb12cc892ce129223fce0ca; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 84e943c335d3bdfed183548c4d59b56f9cb663e6; 0a71021017b89f36efb5044946f5e12b3df8570a; 86c74d79918baf4e60eb29d60c24cb03e69ea5cb; 243fe8974fc1f11afffe9edb8f197cbbc4fed76e; 29add147b0d850cbeca0d9db98ddac7bd4841d15; 791ee0c644dae1efe99fb56764ceb71998e3828e; 4afd91c9d0d644451e5058218662a2a7d7c0cb6c; fca7149cd7df7cb846ca6e3b8be55b587ddb709c; 19eb9f3bcc08eafa80b483b5f36b0dcf1eddb910; 822b24a57bbdd9b5839e279f54da43ad95192a49; 9e011397a9d6e5ba6c68bb8b996480cab9ee337f; 0021dd1e3cb902417f117f6b47f9ec56e785e9dc; edd38805a1717b53c2efb88225e9a088abbf3a4d; e8a17857347edbd4f167d8875e8e1208b93c9a33; 11436adb5fdc4d086c0b04c1bbfdc009a58ace53; 88d01049b49f08c57b2b99e3abd4bb6634e58ad8; c19e0a7e7ca61c7ca3aa9edb0837abf24b89d3ee; 8361cf946f8cc4e1ba211301e502db16c03441c7; 65c8c812b6e8a4eb72d77d98cff3d7fb4f09ae9e; 76638b1bb15097926b6ecb57a7f25e44bd179a3d; 2d5b040efec060b33c1c4ef72231655de93398c4; 5e3e009b4a35054c743af595698270ef6d95fe66; cf2785f9de26afd8ad2c2f823bf9e7d3f74957ac; 1d906f0257d4252b9227098162822f4737e20e9d; e44d9b5a9b130762b9e03492b24f95f8dd4b5643; 2f41ca10c5f695091a399dcc551e99e6fe8a75e2; 8b972b8f6705d665c418ce70b9d5f38f7a8043f9; d7fe2790a7e05d0ae87bcf0c9a300d933bf15671; 188186e08f5dff92de2afe8fcd3dd1acee936ccb,BMC Bioinformatics,13,46 - 46
9531a2d47e632bb520127fdb98c3a18b66baf664,Association Analysis of Deep Genomic Features Extracted by Denoising Autoencoders in Breast Cancer,"Artificial intelligence-based unsupervised deep learning (DL) is widely used to mine multimodal big data. However, there are few applications of this technology to cancer genomics. We aim to develop DL models to extract deep features from the breast cancer gene expression data and copy number alteration (CNA) data separately and jointly. We hypothesize that the deep features are associated with patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes. Two unsupervised denoising autoencoders (DAs) were developed to extract deep features from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) breast cancer gene expression and CNA data separately and jointly. A heat map was used to view and cluster patients into subgroups based on these DL features. Fisher's exact test and Pearson' Chi-square test were applied to test the associations of patients' groups and clinical information. Survival differences between the groups were evaluated by Kaplanâ»Meier (KM) curves. Associations between each of the features and patient's overall survival were assessed using Cox's proportional hazards (COX-PH) model and a risk score for each feature set from the different omics data sets was generated from the survival regression coefficients. The risk scores for each feature set were binarized into high- and low-risk patient groups to evaluate survival differences using KM curves. Furthermore, the risk scores were traced back to their gene level DAs weights so that the three gene lists for each of the genomic data points were generated to perform gene set enrichment analysis. Patients were clustered into two groups based on concatenated features from the gene expression and CNA data and these two groups showed different overall survival rates (p-value = 0.049) and different ER (Estrogen receptor) statuses (p-value = 0.002, OR (odds ratio) = 0.626). All the risk scores from the gene expression and CNA data and their concatenated one were significantly associated with breast cancer survival. The patients with the high-risk group were significantly associated with patients' worse outcomes (p-values â‰¤ 0.0023). The concatenated risk score was enriched by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, the regulation of DNA-templated transcription, the regulation of nucleic acid-templated transcription, the regulation of apoptotic process, the positive regulation of gene expression, the positive regulation of cell proliferation, heart morphogenesis, the regulation of cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process, with FDR (false discovery rate) less than 0.05.

A number of tools have been recently developed but their performance needs yet to be thoroughly assessed. To this aim, a comprehensive model that integrates the factors of normal cell contamination and intra-tumour heterogeneity and that can be translated to synthetic data on which to perform benchmarks is indispensable.ResultsWe propose such model and implement it in an R package called CnaGen to synthetically generate a wide range of alterations under different normal cell contamination levels. Six recently published methods for CNA and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection on tumour samples were assessed on this synthetic data and on a dilution series of a breast cancer cell-line: ASCAT, GAP, GenoCNA, GPHMM, MixHMM and OncoSNP. We report the recall rates in terms of normal cell contamination levels and alteration characteristics: length, copy number and LOH state, as well as the false discovery rate distribution for each copy number under different normal cell contamination levels.Assessed methods are in general better at detecting alterations with low copy number and under a little normal cell contamination levels. All methods except GPHMM, which failed to recognize the alteration pattern in the cell-line samples, provided similar results for the synthetic and cell-line sample sets. MixHMM and GenoCNA are the poorliest performing methods, while GAP generally performed better. This supports the viability of approaches other than the common hidden Markov model (HMM)-based.ConclusionsWe devised and implemented a comprehensive model to generate data that simulate tumoural samples genotyped using SNP arrays. The validity of the model is supported by the similarity of the results obtained with synthetic and real data. Based on these results and on the software implementation of the methods, we recommend GAP for advanced users and GPHMM for a fully driven analysis.",2011,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""David MosÃ©n-Ansorena"", ids = ""1401907089""); list(name = ""Ana M.

cb8fd82cceb3a5be6c5e065bcf7c5964281d8391,"Dietary sodium, adiposity, and inflammation in healthy adolescents.","OBJECTIVES
To determine the relationships of sodium intake with adiposity and inflammation in healthy adolescents.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study involved 766 healthy white and African American adolescents aged 14 to 18 years. Dietary sodium intake was estimated by 7-day 24-hour dietary recall. Percent body fat was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Fasting blood samples were measured for leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1.


RESULTS
The average sodium intake was 3280 mg/day. Ninety-seven percent of our adolescents exceeded the American Heart Association recommendation for sodium intake. Multiple linear regressions revealed that dietary sodium intake was independently associated with body weight (Î² = 0.23), BMI (Î² = 0.23), waist circumference (Î² = 0.23), percent body fat (Î² = 0.17), fat mass (Î² = 0.23), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (Î² = 0.25), leptin (Î² = 0.20), and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (Î² = 0.61; all Ps < .05). No relation was found between dietary sodium intake and visceral adipose tissue, skinfold thickness, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, or intercellular adhesion molecule-1. All the significant associations persisted after correction for multiple testing (all false discovery rates < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The mean sodium consumption of our adolescents is as high as that of adults and more than twice the daily intake recommended by the American Heart Association. High sodium intake is positively associated with adiposity and inflammation independent of total energy intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Haidong Zhu"", ids = ""38448191""); list(name = ""Norman K Pollock"", ids = ""3759915""); list(name = ""Ishita Kotak"", ids = ""7515521""); list(name = ""Bernard Gutin"", ids = ""5335700""); list(name = ""Xiaoling Wang"", ids = ""50141007""); list(name = ""Jigar Bhagatwala"", ids = ""6391799""); list(name = ""Samip J.

However, little is known about the effects of inflammation on gut microbial function. We previously reported that colitis induces commensal luminal Escherichia coli to upregulate stress-response genes in monoassociated Il-10-/(KO) mice, but colitis-associated microbial transcription in complex luminal bacterial communities has not been explored. Understanding how inflammation affects gut microbes in a manner that perpetuates colitis could identify novelmicrobial pathways that can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Hypothesis:Mixtures of commensal bacterial isolates induce colitis in KO mice and respond to inflammation by upregulating genes that promote microbial survival. Methods: Germ-free wild-type (WT) and KO 129 SvEv mice were colonized for up to 10 weeks with 8 commensal, predominantly human-derived bacterial isolates (Table) representing each major phylum of the gut microbiome. Intestinal inflammation was quantified by blinded histological scores and spontaneous secretion of Il-12/23p40 by colon explant cultures. Fecal bacterial composition at 5 wks was measured by real-time PCR. Cecal microbial metatranscriptomes at 10 wks were characterized using Illumina-based microbial RNA-Seq and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of conserved domains. Results: At 5 and 10 weeks, KO mice had increased histological inflammation and Il-12/23p40 secretion by colon explant cultures compared to WT mice. At 5 weeks, fecal bacterial composition in WT and KOmice was similar and was dominated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Ruminococcus gnavus. Gut microbial metatranscriptomes in KO and WT mice were significantly different at 10 weeks. While relatively few E. faecalis mRNA's were detected in cecal contents, they comprise the majority of differentially expressed microbial genes (Table). Overall, 76 conserved domains were significantly enriched with genes that are upregulated in bacteria from KO mice including tRNA synthetase (false discovery rate/ FDR=0.001), translation factors (FDR=0.002), cell wall biosynthesis (FDR=0.011), nucleotide salvage pathways (FDR=0.013), bacterial sugar transferase (FDR=0.015), and DNA repair (FDR=0.039). 7 conserved domains were enriched with genes that are downregulated in bacteria from KO mice including thioredoxin (FDR=0.052) and cation transporting ATPase (FDR=0.155). Conclusions: A representative mixture of predominantly human commensal bacterial isolates induces colitis in gnotobiotic Il-10-/mice and responds to inflammation by upregulating genes in metabolic, synthetic and DNA repair pathways. Mechanistic studies of differentially expressed bacterial genes may reveal novel pathways that initiate and/or perpetuate IBDs.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ziad Alnabhani"", ids = ""3862628""); list(name = ""J.

b2cf876ee71652fcc5d79a771cc6268eb9dfe179,Dependence aliasing and the control of family-wise error rate in multiple hypothesis testing,"The validation of the results obtained by hypothesis testing is of special interest in applications that deal with high-dimensional sets of variables. The use of equivocated statistical methods may result in poor control of false positives. On the other hand, overconservative methods may prevent relevant findings. In this paper we define dependence aliasing as the spurious dependence relationship among variables that appears when the number of samples is lesser than the number of variables of a study. We present a novel method for estimating the adjusted p-values in applications that require multiple hypothesis testing. The method increases the statistical power of the results by exploring the dependence among the variables, while controlling false positives in strong sense. The method is compared to other relevant adjustment models such as the false discovery rate method and resampling. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method in medical imaging studies involving progressively larger sets of variables.

5ca5d5c5137a3f1515d4371c116ebc650382138e,Rare coding TTN variants are associated with electrocardiographic QT interval in the general population,"We have shown previously that noncoding variants mapping around a specific set of 170 genes encoding cardiomyocyte intercalated disc (ID) proteins are more enriched for associations with QT interval than observed for genome-wide comparisons. At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we had identified 28 such ID protein-encoding genes. Here, we assessed whether coding variants at these 28 genes affect QT interval in the general population as well. We used exome sequencing in 4,469 European American (EA) and 1,880 African American (AA) ancestry individuals from the population-based ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) Study cohort to focus on rare (allele frequency <1%) potentially deleterious (nonsynonymous, stop-gain, splice) variants (nâ€‰=â€‰2,398 for EA; nâ€‰=â€‰1,693 for AA) and tested their effects on standardized QT interval residuals. We identified 27 nonsynonymous variants associated with QT interval (FDR 5%), 22 of which were in TTN. Taken together with the mapping of a QT interval GWAS locus near TTN, our observation of rare deleterious coding variants in TTN associated with QT interval show that TTN plays a role in regulation of cardiac electrical conductance and coupling, and is a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashish Kapoor"", ids = ""13154739""); list(name = ""Kiranmayee Bakshy"", ids = ""4041535""); list(name = ""Linda Xu"", ids = ""46265797""); list(name = ""Priyanka Nandakumar"", ids = ""3170209""); list(name = ""Dongwon Lee"", ids = ""144791359""); list(name = ""Eric Boerwinkle"", ids = ""2918432""); list(name = ""Megan L.

58afad7d9f12c7bbdaedc944a4db227a1cd025be,LC-MS-based lipidomics to examine acute rat pulmonary responses after nano- and fine-sized ZnO particle inhalation exposure.,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) nano- and fine-sized particles are associated with respiratory toxicity in humans, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic study demonstrated that changes in phosphorylcholine-containing lipids (PC-CLs) in the respiratory system were associated with ZnO particle-induced respiratory toxicity. However, the details of the lipid species associated with adverse effects and possible biomarker signatures have not been identified. Thus, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics platform was applied to examine the alterations of PC-CL species in the lungs of rats treated with a series of concentrations of nano-sized (35â€‰nm) or fine-sized (250â€‰nm) ZnO particles via inhalation. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test with false discovery rate (FDR) control were conducted to explore the perturbed lipid species and to discriminate a potential pulmonary biomarker signature after ZnO particle exposure. The PCA and PLS-DA models revealed that the fine-sized ZnO particle-treated groups and the high-concentration nano-sized group were separated from the control groups as well as from the low and moderate nano-sized groups. The results from the MWU test further suggested that after FDR adjustment, numerous PC-CL species were altered in the high-concentration and moderate-concentration fine-sized groups. Furthermore, our results suggested that lipids involved in anti-oxidation, membrane conformation, and cellular signal transduction were altered in response to ZnO-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. One lipid, PC(18:0/18:1), exhibited good performance (AUCâ€‰>â€‰0.8) of discriminative ability in distinguishing ZnO particle exposure from the control. These findings not only provide a foundation for the exploration of possible ZnO particle-mediated mechanisms but also suggest a lipid biomarker for ZnO particle exposure.",2018,Materials Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sheng Han Lee"", ids = ""4820360""); list(name = ""Chuan-Ho Tang"", ids = ""5422973""); list(name = ""Wan-Yu Lin"", ids = ""49661239""); list(name = ""Ke-Han Chen"", ids = ""50053918""); list(name = ""Hao-Jan Liang"", ids = ""35631363""); list(name = ""T J Cheng"", ids = ""48317969""); list(name = ""Ching-Yu Lin"", ids = ""2734571"")",d1e9c20ebed94dde5cc140397e9e932ccec339f6; f308e6f16ae49afdbcc1ec81d07ae7702d05fb42,,Nanotoxicology,12 5,"

348209ebcdef65fbe38d2ace9429025a121cf14c,Comparative analysis of statistical methods used for detecting differential expression in label-free mass spectrometry proteomics.,"UNLABELLED
Label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics has proven itself to be a powerful method for evaluating protein identification and quantification from complex samples. For comparative proteomics, several methods have been used to detect the differential expression of proteins from such data. We have assessed seven methods used across the literature for detecting differential expression from spectral count quantification: Student's t-test, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), normalised spectral abundance factor (NSAF), normalised spectral abundance factor-power law global error model (NSAF-PLGEM), spectral index (SpI), DESeq and QSpec. We used 2000 simulated datasets as well as publicly available data from a proteomic standards study to assess the ability of these methods to detect differential expression in varying effect sizes and proportions of differentially expressed proteins. At two false discovery rate (FDR) levels, we find that several of the methods detect differential expression within the data with reasonable precision, others detect differential expression at the expense of low precision, and finally, others which fail to identify any differentially expressed proteins. The inability of these seven methods to fully capture the differential landscape, even at the largest effect size, illustrates some of the limitations of the existing technologies and the statistical methodologies.


SIGNIFICANCE
In label-free mass spectrometry experiments, protein identification and quantification have always been important, but there is now a growing focus on comparative proteomics. Detecting differential expression in protein levels can inform on important biological mechanisms and provide direction for further study. Given the high cost and labour intensive nature of validation experiments, statistical methods are important for prioritising proteins of interest. Here, we have performed a comparative analysis to investigate the statistical methodologies for detecting differential expression and provide a reference for future experimental designs.

bf4733c53ad1e590db97fa61e89232acf9ffb070,M48: Transcriptomic Signatures of Schizophrenia Revealed By Dopamine Perturbation of Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines,"Background The dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2)-mediated hyperdopaminergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia. However, dopamine is also known to have other, non-receptor-mediated effects, including oxidative mechanisms leading to apoptosis. While oxidative processes have been reported to contribute to dopamine neuron loss in Parkinson's disease, their role in schizophrenia remains little studied. Methods We performed a dopamine perturbation on lymphoblastoid cell lines from 515 schizophrenia cases and 692 controls, and studied the resultant RNAseq profiles. Results We found that dopamine had widespread effects on expression profiles, though these effects were likely not mediated through dopamine receptors. Upon stimulation, of the reliably expressed genes, 3,756 (19%) had expression changes of >1 standard deviation at a false discovery rate Discussion Our findings suggest that dopamine may play a role in schizophrenia pathogenesis through modulating immune response and apoptosis. Our results also suggest the utility of pathophysiologically relevant perturbation experiments in appropriate cells to investigate the biology of complex mental disorders.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Jubao Duan"", ids = ""88756317""); list(name = ""Alan J.

98fa1b3262ab57ab3a30d378a1b5cd6a19a6cc3c,Estimation of statistical power and false discovery rate of QTL mapping methods through computer simulation,"Many QTL mapping methods have been developed in the past two decades. Statistically, the best method should have a high detection power but a low false discovery rate (FDR). Power and FDR cannot be derived theoretically for most QTL mapping methods, but they can be properly evaluated using computer simulations. In this paper, we used four genetic models (two for independent loci and two for linked loci) to illustrate power and FDR estimation for interval mapping (IM) and inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). For each model, we simulated 1000 populations each of 200 doubled haploids. A support interval (SI) was first defined to indicate to which predefined QTL the significant QTL belonged. Power was calculated by counting the number of simulation runs with significant peaks higher than the logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold in the SI. Quantitative trait loci not identified in any SIs were viewed as false positives. The FDR is the rate at which QTLs are identified as significant when they are actually non-significant.

33e7a85aa058683be3b233b56db3694d1a742c93,205 RNA-SEq PROFILING OF BOVINE PRE-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS,"In order to provide a comprehensive view of the transcriptome changes during the earliest stages of bovine development, we sequenced the total RNA content of bovine oocytes, 4-cell, 8-cell, and 16-cell embryos and the inner cell mass and trophoblast envelope of expanded blastocysts on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. For each experiment pools of in vitro matured oocytes from the German Simmental cows were fertilized by sperm of a single bull, and 10 oocytes or embryos per developmental stage were collected to generate total RNA pools used for sequencing. Synthesis of cDNA was initiated directly in the cell lysate in order to avoid any losses during RNA preparation and was random primed in order to capture all RNA species. Amplified cDNA and unstranded sequencing libraries were prepared using kits from Nugen (Ovation RNA-Seq, Nugen, San Carlos, CA, USA). Biological replicates were generated by inseminating the oocytes with sperm from the distant breeds Jersey (nâ€‰=â€‰3) and Brahman (nâ€‰=â€‰3). This cross-breeding design allowed tracking of single sequencing reads back to the maternal or paternal genome, where breed-specific SNP are present in the expressed transcripts. The analysis of this dataset resulted in monitoring of zygotic genome activation and parent-specific expression for single transcripts, a catalogue of splicing isoforms, novel transcripts, and non-coding RNAs and differentially expressed genes between the single developmental stages. Using the program DESEqn, 2784 genes showed differential expression between any of the stages at a false discovery rate of 1%. Specifically, we found 200 genes differentially expressed between immature and matured oocytes, 209 genes between matured oocytes and 4-cell embryos, 580 genes between the 4-cell and 8-cell stage, 567 genes between the 8-cell and 16-cell stage, 987 genes between the 16-cell stage and the inner cell mass, and 1569 genes between the 16-cell and the trophoblast. Functional analysis revealed stage-specific functions of the differentially expressed genes. In summary, by fully exploiting the single-nucleotide resolution of the RNA-Seq method, this dataset provides an invaluable resource for the study of zygotic genome activation, imprinting, transcript annotation, and gene expression in the earliest developmental stages of bovine embryos.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Stefan Krebs"", ids = ""143924512""); list(name = ""Alexander Graf"", ids = ""50338788""); list(name = ""Zakhartchenko Valeri"", ids = ""87544380""); list(name = ""Helmut Blum"", ids = ""1878489""); list(name = ""Eckhard Wolf"", ids = ""145493807"")",,,"Reproduction, Fertility and Development",25,251-251

Understanding the early relationship between brain tumor cells and their environment could lead to more sensitive biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies. We have been using a rodent model of neurocarcinogenesis in which all animals develop brain tumors by six months of age to establish two early landmarks in glioma development: the appearance of a nestin(+) cell at thirty days of age and the appearance of cellular hyperplasia between 60 and 120 days of age. We now report an assessment of the CSF proteome to determine the changes in protein composition that occur during this period.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Nestin(+) cell clusters and microtumors were assessed in 63 ethylnitrosourea-exposed rats on 30, 60, and 90 days of age. CSF was obtained from the cisterna magna from 101 exposed and control rats at 30, 60, and 90 days and then analyzed using mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed peaks were isolated and identified.


RESULTS
Nestin(+) cells were noted in all ethylnitrosourea-exposed rats assessed pathologically. Small microtumors were noted in 0%, 18%, and 67% of 30-, 60-, and 90-day old rats, respectively (p<0.05, Chi square). False Discovery Rate analysis of peak intensities showed that the number of true discoveries with p<0.05 increased markedly with increasing age. Isolation and identification of highly differentially detected proteins at 90 days of age revealed increases in albumin and a fragment of Î±1 macroglobulin and alterations in glutathionylated transthyretin.


CONCLUSIONS
The presence of increased albumin, fragments of cerebrospinal fluid proteins, and glutathione breakdown in temporal association with the development of cellular hyperplasia, suggests that, similar to many other systemic cancers, inflammation and oxidative stress is playing an important early role in the host's response to brain tumor development and may be involved in affecting the early growth of brain tumor.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""John C.

6ffdecd5d901fa68fbf1621f9a30e4d7825b72ff,Genome-wide expression profiling of patients with primary open angle glaucoma.,"PURPOSE
To identify differentially expressed genes and to elucidate gene interaction networks and molecular pathways possibly contributing to the development of POAG.


METHODS
Genome-wide expression profiling experiments were carried out using ABI high-density oligonucleotide microarrays in leukocytes from 25 POAG patients and 12 age-, ethnicity-, and sex-matched normal controls. Significantly modulated genes were defined as those with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01 and an absolute fold change (FC) >1.5. These genes are then mapped to relevant biologic processes and pathways.


RESULTS
We identified 563 genes that were significantly dysregulated (410 upregulated and 153 downregulated) in POAG compared with normal controls (""POAG gene signature""). These genes were significantly enriched with functions related to, among others, nucleoside, nucleotide, and nucleic acid metabolism, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase cascade, apoptosis, protein synthesis, cell cycle, intracellular signaling cascade, and nervous system development and function. Among the most significantly altered canonical pathways in POAG were the ephrin receptor signaling, ubiquitin proteasome pathway, hypoxia signaling, neuregulin, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Network analysis revealed potentially critical roles of UBE2, TBP, GNAQ, SUMO1, CREB, p70S6k, IFNG, and CaMKII that are interacting with NF-ÎºB, ubiquitin, proteasome, PI3K/AKT, IL12, and PDGF in the disease pathogenesis.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study revealed blood gene signatures that clearly distinguish POAG patients and normal controls, as well as altered pathways that may shed light on POAG pathogenesis.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Dilek Colak"", ids = ""2474992""); list(name = ""JosÃ© Hernando Morales"", ids = ""49583014""); list(name = ""Thomas M.

These centres recruited 1282 (85%, 1282/1506) women into PathIES of whom 1036 had phospho-marker data. All phospho-markers were analysed by immunohistochemistry staining. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models of the phospho-markers for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were adjusted for clinicopathological factors. Treatment effects on the biomarker expression were determined by interaction tests. Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg adjustment for multiple testing with a false discovery rate of 10% was applied (pBH).ResultsPhospho-T202/T204MAPK, pS118ERÎ± and pS167ERÎ± were all found to be correlated (pBHâ€‰=â€‰0.0002). These markers were not associated with either DFS or OS when controlling for the established clinicopathological factors. Interaction terms between the phospho-markers and treatment strategies for either DFS or OS were not statistically significant (pBHâ€‰>â€‰0.05 for all).ConclusionsThis PathIES study confirmed previously described associations between the phosphorylation site markers of AKT, MAPK and ERÎ± activity in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. No prognostic correlations between the phosphorylation markers and clinical outcome were found, nor were they predictive for clinical outcomes among patients who switched therapy over those treated with tamoxifen alone.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Zsolt Szijgyarto"", ids = ""50520081""); list(name = ""Koen D.

752d8dabfb01866ae3702b1fd2c15c57e441c285,Two distinct subtypes of right temporal variant frontotemporal dementiaSYMBOL,"Background:Right temporal frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an anatomic variant of FTD associated with relatively distinct behavioral and cognitive symptoms. We aimed to determine whether right temporal FTD is a homogeneous clinical, imaging, and pathologic/genetic entity. Methods:In this case-control study, 101 subjects with FTD were identified. Atlas-based parcellation generated temporal, frontal, and parietal grey matter volumes which were used to identify subjects with a right temporal dominant atrophy pattern. Clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, and neuropathologic features were reviewed. The subjects with right temporal FTD were grouped by initial clinical diagnosis and voxel-based morphometry was used to assess grey matter loss in the different groups, compared to controls, and each other. Results:We identified 20 subjects with right temporal FTD. Twelve had been initially diagnosed with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), and the other 8 with semantic dementia (SMD). Personality change and inappropriate behaviors were more frequent in the bvFTD group, while prosopagnosia, word-finding difficulties, comprehension problems, and topographagnosia were more frequent in the SMD group. The bvFTD group showed greater loss in frontal lobes than the SMD group. The SMD group showed greater fusiform loss than the bvFTD group. All 8 bvFTD subjects with pathologic/genetic diagnosis showed abnormalities in tau protein (7 with tau mutations), while all three SMD subjects with pathology showed abnormalities in TDP-43 (p = 0.006). Conclusions:We have identified 2 subtypes of right temporal variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) allowing further differentiation of FTD subjects with underlying tau pathology from those with TDP-43 pathology.

a6339148c7f8cb3e768125c400e7e6a2836debf0,Parallel comparison of Illumina RNA-Seq and Affymetrix microarray platforms on transcriptomic profiles generated from 5-aza-deoxy-cytidine treated HT-29 colon cancer cells and simulated datasets,"BackgroundHigh throughput parallel sequencing, RNA-Seq, has recently emerged as an appealing alternative to microarray in identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) between biological groups. However, there still exists considerable discrepancy on gene expression measurements and DEG results between the two platforms. The objective of this study was to compare parallel paired-end RNA-Seq and microarray data generated on 5-azadeoxy-cytidine (5-Aza) treated HT-29 colon cancer cells with an additional simulation study.MethodsWe first performed general correlation analysis comparing gene expression profiles on both platforms. An Errors-In-Variables (EIV) regression model was subsequently applied to assess proportional and fixed biases between the two technologies. Then several existing algorithms, designed for DEG identification in RNA-Seq and microarray data, were applied to compare the cross-platform overlaps with respect to DEG lists, which were further validated using qRT-PCR assays on selected genes. Functional analyses were subsequently conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).ResultsPearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the RNA-Seq and microarray data each exceeded 0.80, with 66%~68% overlap of genes on both platforms. The EIV regression model indicated the existence of both fixed and proportional biases between the two platforms. The DESeq and baySeq algorithms (RNA-Seq) and the SAM and eBayes algorithms (microarray) achieved the highest cross-platform overlap rate in DEG results from both experimental and simulated datasets. DESeq method exhibited a better control on the false discovery rate than baySeq on the simulated dataset although it performed slightly inferior to baySeq in the sensitivity test. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR, but not microarray data, confirmed the expected reversal of SPARC gene suppression after treating HT-29 cells with 5-Aza. Thirty-three IPA canonical pathways were identified by both microarray and RNA-Seq data, 152 pathways by RNA-Seq data only, and none by microarray data only.ConclusionsThese results suggest that RNA-Seq has advantages over microarray in identification of DEGs with the most consistent results generated from DESeq and SAM methods. The EIV regression model reveals both fixed and proportional biases between RNA-Seq and microarray.

96236b1ab47a55f4b2dd192c48ecedcd239df7c8,Effect of Brain Tumor Presence During Radiation on Tissue Toxicity: Transcriptomic and Metabolic Changes.,"PURPOSE
Radiation therapy (RT) causes functional and transcriptomic changes in the brain; however, most studies have been carried out in normal rodent brains. Here, the long-term effect of irradiation and tumor presence during radiation was investigated.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Male Wistar rats âˆ¼7Â weeks old were divided into 3 groups: sham implant, RT+sham implant, and RT+tumor implant (C6 glioma). Hypofractionated irradiation (8 or 6Â Gy/day for 5Â days) was localized to a 1-cm strip of cranium starting 5Â days after implantation, resulting in complete tumor regression and prolonged survival. Biopsy of tissue was performed in the implant area 65Â days after implantation. RNA was hybridized to GeneChip Rat Exon 1.0 ST array. Data were analyzed using significant analysis of microarrays and ingenuity pathway analysis. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) imaging was performed in the implantation site 65 to 70Â days after implantation using a 9.4Â T Biospec magnetic resonance imaging scanner with a quadrature rat brain array. Immunohistochemical staining for astrogliosis, HMG-CoA synthase 2, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and taurine was performed at âˆ¼65Â days after implantation.


RESULTS
Eighty-four genes had a false discovery rate <3.5%. We compared RT+tumor implant with RT+sham implant animals. The tumor presence affected networks associated with cancer/cell morphology/tissue morphology. 1H-MRS showed significant reduction in taurine levels (P<.04) at the implantation site in both groups. However, the RT+tumor group also showed significant increase in levels of neurotransmitter GABA (P=.02). Hippocampal taurine levels were only significantly reduced in the RT+tumor group (P=.03). HMG-CoA synthase 2, GABA and taurine levels were confirmed using staining. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining demonstrated a significant increase in inflammation that was heightened in the RT+tumor group.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data indicate that tumor presence during radiation significantly affects long-term functional transcriptomics landscape and neurotransmitter levels at the tumor implantation site/normal tissue, accompanied by increased inflammation (astrogliosis).",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Janice A.

d473c76109472cc3959c2bac8f6c93e7c67395f7,[Correlation of betweenness centrality of the right hemispheric network with ejaculatory function in premature ejaculation patients].,"Objective
To explore the topological properties of the betweenness centrality of the nodes and edges in the brain white matter network of premature ejaculation (PE) patients and analyze the correlation of the importance of the key brain regions and interregional white matter structural connectivity with the ejaculatory function of the patients.Method: We collected the demographic and clinical data, along with the T1 and MR diffusion tensor imaging (MR-DTI) data, on 18 PE patients and 22 normal controls matched in age, sex and education. After preprocessing of the data obtained, we divided the whole brain into 90 symmetrical cortical and subcortical regions (defined as nodes of the brain network) by automated anatomical labeling, examined the structural connectivity between different brain regions by probabilistic white matter fiber tracking (defined as edges of the brain network), and calculated the betweenness centrality of the nodes and edges using the brain connection toolbox. Then, we performed the Mann-Whitney U test on the betweenness centrality of the nodes and edges, subjected the results to false discovery rate (FDR) correction, and assessed the correlation of the attribute values of between-group differences with the ejaculatory function of the patients.


RESULTS
Compared with the normal controls, the PE patients showed a significantly decreased betweenness centrality of the right superior occipital gyrus (SOG) (281.18 Â± 255.26 vs 67.78 Â± 58.98, Z = ï¼3.49, FDR-corrected P < 0.05), but increased betweenness centrality of the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) (222.91 Â± 155.60 vs 557.00 Â± 322.65, Z = 3.55, FDR-corrected P < 0.05) and betweeness centrality of the edge between the right rolandic operculum and right insula (4.23 Â± 8.39 vs 23.83 Â± 23.91, Z = 3.84, FDR-corrected P < 0.05). The betweenness centrality of the right SOG was correlated negatively with the level of difficulty in delaying ejaculation (r = ï¼0.51, P = 0.03) and the probability of ejaculation before expectation (r= ï¼0.61, P = 0.01), while that of the right STG positively with PE-related frustration (r = 0.54, P = 0.02) and the level of concern about PE-related distress of the partner (r = 0.47, P = 0.04).


CONCLUSIONS
Abnormalities of structural connections were found in the visual stimulus- and emotion processing-related regions in the right cerebral hemisphere of PE patients, which might be associated with rapid ejaculation or decreased ejaculation control and lead to a series of psychological problems.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jianhuai Chen"", ids = ""7557908""); list(name = ""Xinfei Huang"", ids = ""11350319""); list(name = ""Li-Qin Dai"", ids = ""41052550""); list(name = ""Tao Liu"", ids = ""87723693""); list(name = ""Zhijian Yao"", ids = ""47845875""); list(name = ""Yutian Dai"", ids = ""81137793""); list(name = ""Yun Chen"", ids = ""49069567"")",,,Zhonghua nan ke xue = National journal of andrology,25 7,"

923646e4b41f48c5706c4cdaddbc3aa8ef402558,Proteogenomics of Pristionchus pacificus reveals distinct proteome structure of nematode models.,"Pristionchus pacificus is a nematode model organism whose genome has recently been sequenced. To refine the genome annotation we performed transcriptome and proteome analysis and gathered comprehensive experimental information on gene expression. Transcriptome analysis on a 454 Life Sciences (Roche) FLX platform generated >700,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from two normalized EST libraries, whereas proteome analysis on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer detected >27,000 nonredundant peptide sequences from more than 4000 proteins at sub-parts-per-million (ppm) mass accuracy and a false discovery rate of <1%. Retraining of the SNAP gene prediction algorithm using the gene expression data led to a decrease in the number of previously predicted protein-coding genes from 29,000 to 24,000 and refinement of numerous gene models. The P. pacificus proteome contains a high proportion of small proteins with no known homologs in other species (""pioneer"" proteins). Some of these proteins appear to be products of highly homologous genes, pointing to their common origin. We show that >50% of all pioneer genes are transcribed under standard culture conditions and that pioneer proteins significantly contribute to a unimodal distribution of predicted protein sizes in P. pacificus, which has an unusually low median size of 240 amino acids (26.8 kDa). In contrast, the predicted proteome of Caenorhabditis elegans follows a distinct bimodal protein size distribution, with significant functional differences between small and large protein populations. Combined, these results provide the first catalog of the expressed genome of P. pacificus, refinement of its genome annotation, and the first comparison of related nematode models at the proteome level.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nadine Borchert"", ids = ""16202454""); list(name = ""Christoph Dieterich"", ids = ""1762370""); list(name = ""Karsten Krug"", ids = ""40329575""); list(name = ""W.

ef14549dfe854ff33d2b36bec2018c9a5f0e80e2,"Folate metabolism genes, vegetable intake and renal cancer risk in central Europe.","In a multicenter case-control study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) conducted in central and eastern Europe, we reported a strong inverse association with high vegetable intake and RCC risk. The odds ratio (OR) for high compared to the lowest tertile of vegetable intake was OR = 0.67; (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53-0.83; p-trend < 0.001). We hypothesized that variation in key folate metabolism genes may modify this association. Common variation in 5 folate metabolism genes (CBS: Ex9+33C > T (rs234706), Ex13 +41C > T (rs1801181), Ex18 -391 G > A (rs12613); MTHFR: A222V Ex5+79C > T (rs1801133), Ex8-62A > C (rs1801131); MTR: Ex26 20A > G (rs1805087), MTRR: Ex5+136 T > C (rs161870), and TYMS:IVS2-405 C > T (rs502396), Ex8+157 C > T (rs699517), Ex8+227 A > G (rs2790)) were analyzed among 1,097 RCC cases and 1,555 controls genotyped in this study. Having at least 1 variant T allele of MTHFR A222V was associated with higher RCC risk compared to those with 2 common (CC) alleles (OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.17-1.77; p = 0.001). After stratification by tertile of vegetable intake, the higher risk associated with the variant genotype was only observed in the low and medium tertiles (p-trend = 0.001), but not among those in the highest tertile (p-interaction = 0.22). The association remained robust after calculation of the false discovery rate (FDR = 0.05). Of the 3 TYMS SNPs examined, only the TYMS IVS2 -405 C (rs502396) variant was associated with a significantly lower risk compared to the common genotype (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.57-0.93). Vegetable intake modified the association between all 3 TYMS SNPs and RCC risk (p-interaction < 0.04 for all). In summary, these findings suggest that common variation in MTHFR and TYMS genes may be associated with RCC risk, particularly when vegetable intake is low.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lee E Moore"", ids = ""35205408""); list(name = ""Rayjean J.

f3782cd0efe4195c90e511434c2e61960a58bb6f,Controlling Bayes directional false discovery rate in random effects model,"Abstract Starting with a decision theoretic formulation of simultaneous testing of null hypotheses against two-sided alternatives, a procedure controlling the Bayesian directional false discovery rate (BDFDR) is developed through controlling the posterior directional false discovery rate (PDFDR). This is an alternative to Lewis and Thayer [2004. A loss function related to the FDR for random effects multiple comparison. J. Statist. Plann. Inference 125, 49â€“58.] with a better control of the BDFDR. Moreover, it is optimum in the sense of being the non-randomized part of the procedure maximizing the posterior expectation of the directional per-comparison power rate given the data, while controlling the PDFDR. A corresponding empirical Bayes method is proposed in the context of one-way random effects model. Simulation study shows that the proposed Bayes and empirical Bayes methods perform much better from a Bayesian perspective than the procedures available in the literature.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) related common variants in the interleukin-6 (Il-6) receptor (IL6R) gene to plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Because IL6R variants were previously associated with IL-6 levels, we tested whether the associations with CRP were independent of IL-6 and the interactions between IL6R variants and CRP in relation to diabetes risk.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Plasma CRP and IL-6 levels and 10 IL6R polymorphisms were determined in a nested case-control study of 633 diabetic and 692 healthy Caucasian women.


RESULTS
In both nondiabetic and diabetic women, IL6R polymorphisms were associated with plasma CRP levels, independent of IL-6 concentration. After adjustment of IL-6 levels, CRP concentrations in the genotype AA, AC, and CC of the GWAS polymorphism rs8192284 were 0.32, 0.26, and 0.24 pg/ml, respectively, among nondiabetic women (P for trend = 0.003; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.01) and 0.63, 0.48, and 0.43 pg/ml among diabetic women (P for trend <0.0001; FDR = 0.0001). Haplotypes inferred from polymorphisms within a linkage disequilibrium block including rs8192284 were also significantly associated with CRP levels (P = 0.0002). In an exploratory analysis, rs8192284 showed significant interactions with CRP levels in relation to diabetes risk (P for interaction = 0.026). The odds ratios across increasing quartiles of CRP were 2.19 (95% CI 1.42-3.36), 2.03 (1.27-3.23), and 2.92 (1.77-4.82) in the carriers of allele-C and 2.21 (1.18-4.12), 3.77 (1.87-7.57), and 5.02 (2.4-10.5) in the noncarriers.


CONCLUSIONS
IL6R variants were significantly associated with plasma CRP, independent of IL-6 levels. IL6R variants may interact with CRP in predicting diabetes risk.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lu Qi"", ids = ""49230993""); list(name = ""Nader Rifai"", ids = ""49923725""); list(name = ""Frank B Hu"", ids = ""1891795"")",2fdad1a8e42a27fe888e6b0ff215eecb76c276ce; 0aa3ceb0f8fd22ab599335fa5760dbacf1e0d883; 16ef64fa64365feac96a11d7161f3b70b932c145; f73f249df2dd3aace663ca9a280f17addb1a1322; 68de2b59c94b0e01c3851de70491b7513c7d99b4; 04e895dc7ac8654449e1e98567b4a20c5de1cbbd; 22809e91306ae5839442d311858e7e491bfcd1e6; b800cb3c293f00663dc7f85590ab8db2c4b32aad; 70429da52d15343fab46f9969b2fbeddcd713c3f; 58b9a214419fdcba3fcb7e7082bae71d740c7a2b; 60191c208812ac1ddb2926c04e97d78ea9805592; cb2d44b276e0fc3ac0bb58a1ef0346fa16c9010b; 2c94c5ffd53fa998f445fff6b440cb90999849bc; cbe88f2b6b091a02eee4235cf58a3c3b86f44de2; fbf452cba5cefafacb0bdcc3d55bdfd6e0a3575b; 1c584789f093132c78d765e71171e150c54bf177; 787713f56b317dd5619c9a15b6bc082c2a782016; 1d38194d4e061bdd4d7447cb45477c8eff904ebc; 64610d005b24ddbfe688862901a415e067d2b637; c0c281ba0d3e4388eb1ad8a58b5b2f25d695e276; 341c65359808789fe8fc509ea12fcd3c1b08528d; ac5fa5b8b03fde6fb5208184aa0897489d8df24c; bcc4d505cb385deab4ad5138dccade3ad2fe967b; 27592076b6cc986de0a1b8a9ba35c1ef0a3bf913; 6935f50782646534736f2141b40baff681611b14; fc876102a56d62596705f22f315c30cf6edf52b2; b359206f8b99302f3a4c87de1c0f602eb6a49d11; 468e120cf504b50bf4d16e8f7f736353fb81704d; 6a9434a7803b37ce00e7d709a1fedd0f8330a1ff; d5b2ebfb9658572d07a001037d269cbcad2e88cb,9e829b71ccff3d7bda327905fe15a65b328bef14; c7e0c40d3c9a3e48b1a0de86f1458ac2553fec81; 1079699951213817beb54508400fc4d4084e5972; 745ff03fdf22b04de3b66b55836f62e6973c73ae; 5a57173163e8b957d7c8a4b35df202d989b424e3; cb58bdde2d3e954c17ca125b324c0b7df9cec7d6; 5b59a06dc2d774c5aa798b9972751a51c9d6989d; 7b5337dd5a0e6d8bf7e3b036bcb25a23c589a7a9; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 85c8d206c5aec71475ecefec65cae615f3ddde10; 5d8463a9bb699291d629d1f1068d91a66badafe2; f754e46e8896b5859c41b92eeaac1dc5aa79e7a6; 3618a04bbb9ac2079befe69c6ed05f26687fa065; 0d38174a887a714b0e87b47e45e4a9bfb3454e99; 45daa3c5a9aec458bc4972e794f58c948eb48e12; 1fda0f889b040edf5ad15501e65d95dd66ca341e; dc614ed3fcdb8c40564511bf9f5a2caa276f0be0; c4910cc76f77eac7410a96fecdf13327f104d65b; 1e68b68b919772f417984dd191596967056e1558; 7dcee7ea08713cc2327a67ce26242561e86b6609; c7e24a94d85b19461c80ace4f7e343b1fef9dbfe; 9afd589b208eee5151511f9ed4b7ae5a17507d7d; fe0e82015124a1e76671e39296430f99614d3140,Diabetes,58,275 - 278
1d1ed0017988f0da605ffe912ff53da1c086d7d0,Genome-wide computational identification of functional RNA elements in Trypanosoma brucei,"BackgroundPost-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is the dominant regulatory mechanism in trypanosomatids as their mRNAs are transcribed from polycistronic units. A few cis-acting RNA elements in 3'-untranslated regions of mRNAs have been identified in trypanosomatids, which affect the mRNA stability or translation rate in different life stages of these parasites. Other functional RNAs (fRNAs) also play essential roles in these organisms. However, there has been no genome-wide analysis for identification of fRNAs in trypanosomatids.ResultsFunctional RNAs, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and cis-acting RNA elements involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, were predicted based on two independent computational analyses of the genome of Trypanosoma brucei. In the first analysis, the predicted candidate ncRNAs were identified based on conservation with the related trypanosomatid Leishmania braziliensis. This prediction had a substantially low estimated false discovery rate, and a considerable number of the predicted ncRNAs represented novel classes with unknown functions. In the second analysis, we identified a number of function-specific regulatory motifs, based on which we devised a classifier that can be used for homology-independent function prediction in T. brucei.ConclusionThis first genome-wide analysis of fRNAs in trypanosomatids restricts the search space of experimental approaches and, thus, can significantly expedite the process of characterization of these elements. Our classifier for function prediction based on cis-acting regulatory elements can also, in combination with other methods, provide the means for homology-independent annotation of trypanosomatid genomes.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Yuan Mao"", ids = ""152217179""); list(name = ""Hamed S.

However, they have not always reported consistent results, thereby necessitating cross-study comparisons. Here, a meta-analysis of eight geographically and technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, nâ€‰=â€‰768), which was controlled for several confounders, identified a core set of 29 species significantly enriched in CRC metagenomes (false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5). CRC signatures derived from single studies maintained their accuracy in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved detection accuracy and disease specificity for CRC. Functional analysis of CRC metagenomes revealed enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes and depleted carbohydrate degradation genes. Moreover, we inferred elevated production of secondary bile acids from CRC metagenomes, suggesting a metabolic link between cancer-associated gut microbes and a fat- and meat-rich diet. Through extensive validations, this meta-analysis firmly establishes globally generalizable, predictive taxonomic and functional microbiome CRC signatures as a basis for future diagnostics.Cross-study analysis defines fecal microbial species associated with colorectal cancer.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jakob Wirbel"", ids = ""6727863"");

In this study, two inbred chicken lines with different responses to NDV, Fayoumi and Leghorn, were challenged with LaSota NDV strain at 21 days of age. Through transcriptome analysis, gene expression in spleen at 2 and 6 days post-inoculation was compared between NDV-infected and control groups, as well as between chicken lines. At a false discovery rate <0.05, Fayoumi chickens, which are relatively more resistant to NDV, showed fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than Leghorn chickens. Several interferon-stimulated genes were identified as important DEGs regulating immune response to NDV in chicken. Pathways predicted by IPA analysis, such as ""EIF-signaling"", ""actin cytoskeleton organization nitric oxide production"" and ""coagulation system"" may contribute to resistance to NDV in Fayoumi chickens. The identified DEGs and predicted pathways may contribute to differential responses to NDV between the two chicken lines and provide potential targets for breeding chickens that are more resistant to NDV.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ji-bin Zhang"", ids = ""49050437""); list(name = ""Michael G.

cf10ffb0f534238c430604c0ccded1ebe1c716fd,Relation of Dietary Carbohydrates Intake to Circulating Sex Hormone-binding Globulin Levels in Postmenopausal Women,"Background: Circulating sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations have been suggested to be a protective factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hormonedependent cancers. However, the relation between various aspects of dietary carbohydrates and circulating SHBG concentrations remains unclear. Methods: We analyzed the baseline data from postmenopausal women with available SHBG measurements (n=11,159) who participated in the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative (WHI). Associations of total dietary carbohydrates, glycemic load (GL), glycemic index (GI), fiber, sugar and intake of various carbohydrate-abundant foods with circulating SHBG were assessed using linear regression models with adjustment for multiple covariates. Linear trend was tested across quartiles of the dietary variables. Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons. Results: Higher dietary GL based on total and available carbohydrates, dietary GI based on total and available carbohydrates, and higher intake of sugar and sugar sweetened beverages were associated with lower concentrations of circulating SHBG (all Ptrend < 0.05; q-value after FDR correction = 0.035, 0.013, 0.067, 0.103, 0.008, <.001, respectively). Higher intake of fiber was associated with increased SHBG concentrations (Ptrend = 0.011, q-value after FDR correction = 0.037). There was no significant association of total carbohydrates or other carbohydrateabundant foods with SHBG concentrations.

cbec6add0b0b2a8599f0055b25aadf02362e2600,Detrimental Effect of Hypercholesterolemia on High-Density Lipoprotein Particle RemodelingÂ inÂ Pigs.,"BACKGROUND
Beneficial effects of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) seem altered in patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease. We recently demonstrated in a swine model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) that hypercholesterolemia abolishes HDL-related cardioprotection.


OBJECTIVES
This study sought to investigate, using the same animal model, whether the reported impairment of HDL cardioprotective function was associated with alterations in HDL remodeling and functionality.


METHODS
Pigs were fed a normocholesterolemic (NC) or hypercholesterolemic (HL) diet for 10Â days, reaching non-HDL cholesterol concentrations of 38.2 Â± 3.5Â mg/dl and 218.6 Â± 27.6Â mg/dl, respectively (pÂ < 0.0001). HDLs were isolated,Â and lipidomics and differential proteomics tests were performed to determine HDL molecular changes. HDL functionality and particle size were determined.


RESULTS
Using principal component analysis, we identified 255 molecular lipid species differentially clustered in NC-HDL and HL-HDL. Ninety lipid metabolites were differentially expressed, and 50 showed at least 1.5-fold variation (false discovery rate adjustment q valueÂ <0.05). HL-HDLs presented a core enriched in cholesteryl esters and a surface depleted of phosphatidylcholine species containing polyunsaturated and long-chain fatty acids, indicating the presence of mature HDL particles with low surface fluidity. Hypercholesterolemia induced an important change in HDL-transported proteins (576 spots in HL-HDL vs. 621 spots in NC-HDL). HL-HDLs showed a reduced content of lipocalin retinol binding protein 4 and apolipoprotein M and in the retinoic acid-transporter cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (pÂ <Â 0.05 vs. NC-HDL). No changes were observed in apolipoprotein A-I content and profile. Functionally, HL-HDL showed lower antioxidant activity (-35%) and a reduced capacity to efflux cholesterol (-60%) compared to NC-HDL (pÂ < 0.05). Hypercholesterolemia induced larger HDL particles.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that hypercholesterolemia induces HDL lipidomic changes, losing phosphatidylcholine-lipid species and gaining cholesteryl esters, and proteomic changes, with losses in cardioprotective proteins. These remodelingÂ changesÂ shifted HDL particles toward a dysfunctional state.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Teresa PadrÃ³"", ids = ""83013600""); list(name = ""Judit Cubedo"", ids = ""6993908""); list(name = ""Sandra Camino"", ids = ""12743564""); list(name = ""Maria Teresa BÃ©jar"", ids = ""33672176""); list(name = ""Soumaya Ben-Aicha"", ids = ""46687077""); list(name = ""Guiomar Mendieta"", ids = ""11687517""); list(name = ""Joan Carles EscolÃ -Gil"", ids = ""1397951096""); list(name = ""Rafael Escate"", ids = ""9541380""); list(name = ""Manuel GutiÃ©rrez"", ids = ""144094809""); list(name = ""Laura CasanÃ­"", ids = ""4872261""); list(name = ""L Badimon"", ids = ""50074163""); list(name = ""Gemma Vilahur"", ids = ""6284893"")",fe6244a9046c137c6b310f497fd33645c38f02ff; 256f2a4c1dbbf866653bdbb572b68e8ca4159026; 6ef0e573385676c63fef1494a8955e8e151daa8b; 7fa3f6f5f63fcca7c3da080bf5940f8919c5dee6; bd26a7f9b686d4ac0a7393b1b04906465e6226c1; edd0f7bda61310a7c44548fd125cdd1391783aeb; 9a71165d6e75ff967b74ba52e403b1d1d50c9719; f135dc70f101009f20fd08875cbb2962aa7c895b; 8a7c23e334ccdad3d20981f7a705c395b8a8cd7f; 8b8c53f12f9d7a9ff4d2e85cd8ea9c275bc1296d; 141560d042d2845ab3b9a7899ecbb50de7dd9a59; 24343fd4ad775e0e75285e48f310f8ff20863643; f2c7f9d3ae89a29d42f6bfacd2bb997e1a69b887; 96b0418938436c11a50cbb2300a03b56a21fde25; ed16f4ac47f8e6fe4c3beb47bc515bd1944912b6,9a683b294ce6c2654503447263913367b8e1c7c5; 7da949a5d6c2f80bd650b98d3fa69c451e623e0e; 93d84fee7b1233a1dce36f2d64b1853a9d960abf; 84432b9eb1df53af539c94c4c23aa195d6abcf55; d7ad7fd937b573033ec1b6183d40946eba3a1b9e; 3d0e33ba0ed12f32fac22dc9a370448efbda8620; 573563f780dd06764d24825c64d9ec426102cb34; 79845329837f1430366c9317e10be49fca6c3627; c45d4ae5aa09035870c96b4364da284f3bc2797e; 33d355542d040c03cd0aac463137dddd328f9a32; e6353b3d1e375b31de4c4709582b6ffc11a2889e; 5a3a81fadcd2a6b6f8daf1915bcc587d794f487b; 2d79dd537d1d07c9fc7b9151cf9cad996af2e492; 70b2c4ea2cd77f2a7833209fc3c870a905b61131; f12060675a2e47acc78b09c25a5b19f5dbbf1373; 411da8356d2fee631663c912d7e472369f2b51db; 8b42eb7f7a79c3ce4e652b3660f143e5fe35b651; 54e3c8042fa4ca20919b2aa2d024d09baf5af8df; 849d210ba69ed0838a34e0c71399e644404167f2; b3cda9da68530788522209e1b906e55e533a4485; 27a7763ac1ab3a5f5d203a3947d0b1a248243950; 2c79b97d191bace5e1774f509a95a68fb1a536d8; 8e6f0a31d6bd4c6635249efb1d39844d86d7969b; ff4ca2bd481ac4667a25c9101c0620ca378ad44d; f131fbf7de3b8f56e1776606968682effcfee0d5; d6d2ee57754ce5c7b52ee3a9cb2f4ae8fb035a83; 71d4f29a9691556b9e98216ce259197946bc75a4; f7646a21dff451afe3743ae5aaa3d602426c0df0; 596ec104bdd9a4651482239a124e50e09cc58812; eca04b95132a7ece7a0a2abf62ce595b98554b97; dfbc51ffe669c88af089d310b82a5b0bef032243; bf45a87efa2389b92cd4ea5954a7a66db01ce310; a5a159eddf8082ce559f2aa6b31f7c24975942c9; dca7202820b6130e967a5c2c4eeaa6af72837e57; f95eb930c37464762851d8cd4895ac0c62d4eb31; 7b67ea5a3b8473971540b152f75817dd7ca32c8a; 52afb45582c8f69d141faf5248b09d5515563d81; ef54669a7cd1a815ca2a7b70118ea97aff60d675; 2f09876287372a7774c5a3fc023050b96eeaf209; 659cbb0d03690903a737b8199a98e708a5f6c522; ea187d4312fabc3cdd0e9fa40fef429bfdf1af2c; c02f3875aea2de8bc89029ac0226a7958d9496b6; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b2791405272fe57c12861fc23c7c3d613eb7c700; 6210b565a9225c8c129259824bd8e7de3aa381d7; 0fbd64d16413f28523a2335ba503ce65d5293ec6; 5eb8d10febdf16b26d902d5596ae4b35c8ad7de3; aa9716277f3fd47ebffff732d3998e64c1435003; 469021549525113ec8a03e6c6489c2acbbfcd0e0; 5a85e0f7c09f8364aa296f521444386235b480a8; 8623cf765ef023ccec1d95e0a1f29b19f864e793; e5334423cd0bf5f4db3ffcd9b2828ab9639c1306; 395bf0c697a16e1c4dc6dc8fe5f517068627ec4b; 8ec6b4093d811ff440ba5c27c2859491587557be; ecc8eafa7039463c63ae1528551c0af534f7fac0; 5dfbaee63af1606c432fcb07c8d2f73932692149; 749420523d5ef9628c8e73e00ace04509433d95e; cf07266ff014beac6f72ac412e16639939974da2; a7612252f804cfb8899a38551dabc561ee300318; c8dd7fce1d4d880aa380c4df7b841e4c50a2f442; 873fa482c571c3a4970b67e44a2bcd06e9321090; 522e1eb8599826613262faba6899f264a61003a3; 5327cd4b00b426d42d62818b082b809348bd7071; 5c7156de782a8c9fa0cd2fb20a8e3a7e46c92b91; a56b2b064d7a024d96f5e9fca517cb9839a17c3f; 19c2d3ce9a47712ff961a247f7ee0caef439f8bc; cfd6dd9797305473af608ff19be1743cfb42b85c; dbfd9ce8003402d93e16c6d3d0524c8fd30c98cd; 9292350876c9c4434b92ead79c820985f58f2b5e; adbeef24171cf0b0be6f9e2c63f6be52ff8047fe; ff307a1853152bd349cfb25e42b244eea8c11ea5,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,70 2,"

210541a4a37a1bbb5c27a372ba40555d646d0bf8,Stochastic Centre Workshop in Statistics for Gene and Protein Expression,"Introduction Identification of factors that influence gene and protein expression are fundamental problems in molecular biology. High throughput techniques such as microarrays, two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry pose a number of fascinating and challenging statistical problems in experimental planning and data analysis. The statistical analysis in these areas, often in close cooperation with scientists from biology and medicine, have since the late nineties been highly active research fields. 30 minutes are reserved for each talk, followed by 5 minutes for questions. The open pre-workshop seminars will take place at the department of mathematical sciences at Chalmers, lecture hall Euler, on Tuesday May 9. The main workshop will be located at Nya Varvet, by the sea in Gothenburg. For more information visit: Talk Abstracts Tuesday May 9: Open pre-workshop seminars Docent promotion lecture: Finding the needle in the haystack-Multiple testing in biological experiments Petter Mostadway In modern medical and biological research, results are often obtained through complex experiments where inference about thousands of variables or hypotheses is required. The statistical methods traditionally used in biological research can reasonably handle a couple or a handful of hypotheses, and can give very wrong results if applied uncritically on data from for example mi-croarray experiments. In this lecture, I will describe some of the approaches that can be used in such contexts, where inference must be made simultaneously for a long list of hypotheses.The emphasis may be on limiting the possibility of a single falsely rejected null hypothesis (controlling the family-wise error rate) or it may be on controlling the rate of such errors (the false discovery rate). Methods may be based on simply counting the number of hypotheses, or on the dependency between the hypotheses, using for example permutations. Another approach is to estimate the probabilities of different combinations of hypotheses and their alternatives, thus avoiding the hypothesis testing framework. The ideas will be illustrated with various examples from modern biological research, such as microarray experiments, search for regulatory motifs, and EST expression mining.",2006,,"list(name = ""Swarna Swaminathan"", ids = ""49352541""); list(name = ""Marija Cvijovic"", ids = ""47619102""); list(name = ""Per Sunnerhagen"", ids = ""2255467""); list(name = ""Olle Nerman"", ids = ""2819510"")",,c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 3ed8756a567048efa7bc10fa5b7cea6eb578a006; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 0ad8d647e75655626b805301922e5ba912054b0a; 4213a2cd291dce1c6fcdb6fbc314da5cd74e78fe; 93a6285fd5a59bf648ca837d74dad0974e638596; 61a8a8a0a4987d95789fcfbf5e264a07c4c240d8; 59d8bae33ee7254a77fe1823439c94fcfc51a8ff; 2c3f44cbb2b4075fd51bf4f07628fe29263d3477; e6529e672b1d87dbd24a69e60bcaf9df6ddba0b3; 1f701007f789890d1066172094bbf158f002f673,,,

We investigated genes for enzymes and cofactors in the Hcy metabolic pathway for association with Hcy and determined whether associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influenced recurrent stroke risk. Methods: Eighty-six SNPs in 9 candidate genes (BHMT1, BHMT2, CBS, CTH, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, TCN1, and TCN2) were genotyped in 2,206 subjects (83% European American). Associations with Hcy measures were assessed using linear regression models assuming an additive genetic model, adjusting for age, sex, and race and additionally for baseline Hcy when postmethionine load change was assessed. Associations with recurrent stroke were evaluated using survival analyses. Results: Five SNPs in the transcobalamin 2 (TCN2) gene were associated with baseline Hcy (false discovery rate [FDR]â€“adjusted p = 0.049). TCN2 SNP rs731991 was associated with recurrent stroke risk in the low-dose arm of the trial under a recessive model (log-rank test p = 0.009, hazard ratio 0.34). Associations with change in postmethionine load Hcy levels were found with 5 SNPs in the cystathionine &bgr;-synthase (CBS) gene (FDR-adjusted p < 0.031). Conclusions: TCN2 variants contribute to poststroke Hcy levels, whereas variants in the CBS gene influence Hcy metabolism. Variation in the TCN2 gene also affects recurrent stroke risk in response to cofactor therapy.

e198c1460fa608b05a2963eb109051d92d20153a,DNA mismatch repair gene polymorphisms affect survival in pancreatic cancer.,"PURPOSE
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genomic stability and mediates cellular response to DNA damage. We aim to demonstrate whether MMR genetic variants affect overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Using the Sequenom method in genomic DNA, we retrospectively genotyped 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 13 MMR genes from 706 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma seen at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Association between genotype and OS was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models.


RESULTS
At a false discovery rate of 1% (p â‰¤ .0015), 15 SNPs of EXO1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2, PMS2L3, TP73, and TREX1 in patients with localized disease (n = 333) and 6 SNPs of MSH3, MSH6, and TP73 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease (n = 373) were significantly associated with OS. In multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models, SNPs of EXO1, MSH2, MSH3, PMS2L3, and TP73 in patients with localized disease, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and TP73 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and EXO1, MGMT, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2L3, and TP73 in all patients remained significant predictors for OS (p â‰¤ .0015) after adjusting for all clinical predictors and all SNPs with p â‰¤ .0015 in single-locus analysis. Sixteen haplotypes of EXO1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, PMS2, PMS2L3, RECQL, TP73, and TREX1 significantly correlated with OS in all patients (p â‰¤ .001).


CONCLUSION
MMR gene variants may have potential value as prognostic markers for OS in pancreatic cancer patients.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaoqun Dong"", ids = ""6327169""); list(name = ""Yanan Li"", ids = ""1691826""); list(name = ""Kenneth R.

794ada780c69543355431dec529b33ce1ec1f463,Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster reconstruction in multiband bolometer camera surveys,"We present a new method for the reconstruction of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) galaxy clusters in future SZ-survey experiments using multiband bolometer cameras such as Olimpo, APEX, or Planck. Our goal is to optimise SZ-Cluster extraction from our observed noisy maps. None of the algorithms used in the detection chain is tuned using prior knowledge of the SZ-Cluster signal, or other astrophysical sources (Optical Spectrum, Noise Covariance Matrix, or covariance of SZ Cluster wavelet coefficients). First, a blind separation of the different astrophysical components that contribute to the observations is conducted using an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method. This is a new application of ICA to multichannel astrophysical data analysis. Then, a recent non linear filtering technique in the wavelet domain, based on multiscale entropy and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method, is used to detect and reconstruct the galaxy clusters. We use the Source Extractor software to identify the detected clusters. The proposed method was applied on realistic simulations of observations that we produced as mixtures of synthetic maps of the four brightest light sources in the range 143 GHz to 600 GHz namely the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, the extragalactic InfraRed point sources and the Galactic Dust Emission. We also implemented a simple model of optics and noise to account for instrumental effects. Assuming nominal performance for the near future SZ-survey Olimpo, our detection chain recovers 25% of the cluster of mass larger than 10 14 M âŠ™ , with 90% purity. Our results are compared with those obtained with published algorithms. This new method has a high global detection efficiency in the high-purity/low completeness region, being however a blind algorithm (i.e. without using any prior assumptions on the data to be extracted).",2006,Physics,"list(name = ""S.

This study investigated the association of the 27 SNPs located in RASGRF1. GJD2, and ACTC1 genes with pathological myopia in a Chinese Han population.


METHODS
Myopia patients were stratified according to whether they did (nâ€‰=â€‰274) or did not (nâ€‰=â€‰131) have myopic macular degeneration (MMD). The SNPbrowser software was used to identify specific SNPs for analysis and minimal allele frequency of >20%, and a pairwise r(2)â€‰<â€‰0.85 were genotyped using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.


RESULTS
Before controlling for false discovery rate, the frequency of the rs1867315 C/C genotype compared with healthy controls was lower in the myopia group (pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) and in myopia patients without macular degeneration (pâ€‰=â€‰0.019). The frequency of the rs670957A/A genotype was also lower in patients without MMD compared with controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.045). For rs2070664, the frequency of the A allele was higher in the patients with MMD compared to those without MMD (pâ€‰=â€‰0.032). After controlling for a false discovery rate of 5%, there was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between these groups.


CONCLUSION
In this study, there was no association of the analyzed SNPs located in RASGRF1.

34f2cdf386f217bb3125ccc95a80b29a6748f323,"Transgender Use of Cigarettes, Cigars, and E-Cigarettes in a National Study.","INTRODUCTION
Tobacco use among transgender adults continues to be an area of research with few reported findings. The limited literature indicates higher cigarette use among transgender adults, compared with the general population. This national study is the first to report on cigarettes, cigars, and e-cigarettes by examining differences in transgender tobacco use independent of sexual orientation.


METHODS
Data were collected in 2013 using a nationally cross-sectional online survey of U.S. adults (cisgender, n=17,164; transgender, n=168) and analyzed in 2015. Past 30-day tobacco use point estimates and adjusted logistic regression while controlling for false discovery rate were reported for transgender and cisgender respondents.


RESULTS
Transgender adults reported higher past 30-day use of any cigarette/cigar/e-cigarette product (39.7% vs 25.1%) and current use of cigarettes (35.5% vs 20.7%), cigars (26.8% vs 9.3%), and e-cigarettes (21.3% vs 5.0%) compared with cisgender adults (all p-values â‰¤0.003). Transgender respondents had significantly higher odds of past 30-day tobacco product use for any cigarette/cigar/e-cigarette product (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.25, 3.1), e-cigarettes (OR=5.15, 95% CI=3.36, 7.88), cigars (OR=3.56, 95% CI=2.27, 5.59), and cigarettes (OR=2.10, 95% CI=1.35, 3.28) versus cisgender respondents (all p-values â‰¤0.0035).


CONCLUSIONS
Transgender adults are at higher risk for tobacco use than cisgender adults and risk of specific product use varies by gender. This is the first U.S. national study to assess differences in use of various tobacco products using questions that specifically ask for gender identity separately from sexual orientation.

There are two long-term preservation methods employed in the NLGRP: storage in a -18â€¯Â°C freezer (conventional storage) and storage in liquid nitrogen vapor phase at -135 to -180â€¯Â°C (cryopreservation). To test the phenotypic and epigenetic effects of long-term cryopreservation of orthodox seeds, we evaluated 40 cereal rye accessions (20 spring habit and 20 winter habit) stored for 25 years under both conventional storage and cryogenic conditions. In laboratory evaluations of winter habit rye, seeds from cryopreserved samples had significantly higher normal germination percentage (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) and lower abnormal germination percentage (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) than those stored under conventional conditions. Cryopreserved spring habit rye also had higher normal germination percentage (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.01) than conventionally stored samples. In addition, winter rye seedlings from cryopreserved seeds had longer roots and smaller root diameter (Pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) than seedlings from conventionally stored seeds. In field evaluations conducted in Fort Collins, Colorado in 2014-15, spikes of plants grown from conventionally stored seeds of the winter accessions were slightly longer than those from cryopreserved seeds (Pâ€¯=â€¯0.045). To detect DNA methylation changes, a methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (metAFLP) technique was applied to two accessions. After false discovery rate adjustment, no differences in methylation were detected between storage treatments on an individual locus basis. Our study indicated that cryopreservation slowed seed deterioration as evidenced by higher germination rates compared to conventional storage, had only minimal effects on other phenotypic traits, and had no significant effects on DNA methylation status.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jie Lu"", ids = ""145154768""); list(name = ""Stephanie L.

The approach leverages variable importance measures derived from statistical parameters arising in causal inference, defined in such a manner that they may be used to obtain targeted estimates of the relative importance of individual CpG sites with respect to a binary treatment assigned at the phenotype level, thereby providing a new approach to identifying differentially methylated positions. The procedure implemented is computationally efficient, incorporating a preliminary screening step to isolate a subset of sites for which there is cursory evidence of differential methylation as well as a unique multiple testing correction to control the False Discovery Rate with the same rigor as would be available if all sites were subjected to testing. This novel technique for analysis of differentially methylated positions provides an avenue for incorporating flexible state-of-the-art data-adaptive regression procedures (i.e., machine learning) into the estimation of differential methylation effects without the loss of interpretable statistical inference for the estimated quantity.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Nima S.

f3421365446452eae6531aba0b0b03e20a8cd2f5,Transformation invariant control of voxel-wise false discovery rate,"Multiple testing for statistical maps remains a critical and challenging problem in brain mapping. Since the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion was introduced to the neuroimaging community a decade ago, many variations have been proposed, mainly to enhance detection power. However, a fundamental geometrical property known as transformation invariance has not been adequately addressed, especially for the voxel-wise FDR. Correction of multiple testing applied after spatial transformation is not necessarily equivalent to transformation applied after correction in the original space. Without the invariance property, assigning different testing spaces will yield different results. We find that normalized residuals of linear models with Gaussian noises are uniformly distributed on a unit high-dimensional sphere, independent of t-statistics and F-statistics. By defining volumetric measure in the hyper-spherical space mapped by normalized residuals, instead of the image's Euclidean space, we can achieve invariant control of the FDR under diffeomorphic transformation. This hyper-spherical measure also reflects intrinsic â€œvolume of randomnessâ€ in signals. Experiments with synthetic, semi-synthetic and real images demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FDR inconsistency introduced by the choice of testing spaces.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Junning Li"", ids = ""34959277""); list(name = ""Yonggang Shi"", ids = ""49593625""); list(name = ""Arthur W.

Enhancing pigeonpea yield demands a renewed focus on restructuring the ideal plant type by using more efficient approaches like genomic tools. Therefore, the present study aims to identify and validate a set of QTLs/gene(s) presumably associated with various plant ideotype traits in pigeonpea. A total of 133 pigeonpea germplasms were evaluated along with four checks in the augmented design for various ideotype traits i.e. initiation of flowering (IF), days to 50% flowering (DFF), days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), primary branches (PB), seeds per pod (SP) and pod length (PL). We observed significant genetic diversity in the germplasm lines for these traits. The genetic control of IF, DFF, DM and PH renders these traits suitable for detection of marker trait associations. By using residual maximum likelihood algorithm, we obtained appropriate varianceâ€“covariance structures for modeling heterogeneity, correlation of genetic effects and non-genetic residual effects. The estimates of genetic correlations indicated a strong association among earliness traits. The best linear unbiased prediction values were calculated for individual traits, and association analysis was performed in a panel of 95 diverse genotypes with 19 genic SSRs. Out of five QTL-flanking SSRs used here for validation, only ASSR295 could show significant association with FDR and Bonferroni corrections, and accounted for 15.4% IF, 14.2% DFF and 16.2% DM of phenotypic variance (PV). Remaining SSR markers (ASSR1486, ASSR206 and ASSR408) could not qualify false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni criteria, hence declared as false positives. Additionally, we identified two highly significant SSR markers, ASSR8 and ASSR390 on LG 1 and LG 2, respectively. The SSR marker ASSR8 explained up to 22 and 11% PV for earliness traits and PB respectively, whereas ASSR390 controlled up to 17% PV for earliness traits. The validation and identification of new QTLs in pigeonpea across diverse genetic backgrounds brightens the prospects for marker-assisted selection to improve yield gains in pigeonpea.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Prakash G.

eac29aace778ea8208bfabbdbb50a09eea96d760,Cell Segmentation Based on FOPSO Combined With Shape Information Improved Intuitionistic FCM,"Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms have been proved to be effective image segmentation techniques. However, FCM clustering algorithms are sensitive to noises and initialization. They cannot effectively segment cell images with inhomogeneous gray value distributions and complex touching cells. Aiming to overcome these disadvantages, this paper proposes a cell image segmentation algorithm using fractional-order velocity based particle swarm optimization (FOPSO) combined with shape information improved intuitionistic FCM (SI-IFCM) clustering. Iterations are carried out between FOPSO and SI-IFCM to achieve final cell segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has advantages on cell image segmentation, with the highest recall (90.25%) and lowest false discovery rate (0.28%) compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",2019,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiangzhi Bai"", ids = ""39089421""); list(name = ""Chuxiong Sun"", ids = ""35273604""); list(name = ""Changming Sun"", ids = ""1755278"")",cf855eb4ad0992ad206b893cd45499b401f3a13a,5c5be36e3111e42247d78a6d529e4b1d7d2ced12; 1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef; fcf9fc4e23b45345c2404ce7d6cb0fc9dea2c9ec; 2bd588b5f00618d8af1daab44d774daa82b01e00; fb00c289ebb4c1576680f7c3a00cea0bc71900b2; 9009c9685754346deb93f316144a9da1f70ffcd8; adef477b7d08899d25e314f3e97253fbbb7ac4da; d377477080f7e9d0da6cafd1ba8dc36b8309ec29; 9394a5d5adcb626128b6a42c8810b9505a3c6487; 3e2eef771ffa24ad7396f409bc1cda2bfe2f0403; ef6e9dca3acb9e1525f8a8d68badf1688a9c1505; 0a6e62184c29832993d815a775441a955eca56d0; 78c75f1aeb1047876ab8635c77472d3310a9f0d2; de844fed270218dfebf43c4414c0072bb5d98243; 8ee5528645ecaaa8cfd537d3848980479d997bc4; d8c86bd895d8271f9618966b7e95643b793980ba; e6b2646627d7289139c8d472233a5e9f17f509ba; d1a2c658b05076ffa5e5ca178ecd00a3a212e012; 147af5fc4a34f2b539a6e437644d229ad2cb5373; 0d3b177e8d027d44c191e739a3a70ccacc2eac82; 456e2cf0c85af5b87a9258aef2439e021ef02a2f; f3bc7dcad402c22d88a7535929dcd98f28056561; b0574087d5b0b4d4ed4819bdd590a1b7c2024802; 87b0c32b1cc369e45aff6dfa50db954e109579f1; eb62cb89efc34daca6878e9d0a8068220e3a98ad; c1ac5d95cb1a359223282d8a311d7355aba02301; c54cc06e987d72119dba4877da926f8a82823ee2; 166fce83365bc14c82981f1087ef922bdeacf3a7; 4e9498322979ee4aa286b7aed222240d789efd02; b9d8b5a6c731c8704310bf8f4315bfa2204e88c2; af0a2f6300b1888058b45fc96fe5bc4f4ca4302a; 8b494d5a6c4bead14de244c4d11fc3b2ffe9fec9; 41dbea546fe7bf995ee9c82ad4b9dd83b2d8883b; 4f7097cda4224839ab5adc408c560d2e468818cf; c2c4775e6f5bb1daad987a76d4043efec67f2885; f82c12dd609c4f4b34603e81d4dfb60fd3272013; 983539cf198b7d644934040e88356ad9903eaabc; ea551166eae936f89f42c3ced226c11078ee3518; 05f210293e5c1fd6ecc261e956bd281a92ff57ce; a57520b68e73b5e1fc3668b443daf74ebe957cc7; 2a6890c9d8877199cc34ba5e70cbb8b307e956db; 00339e89348fdda5b019591de93f0c6bf229bf4b; 83c845fec6cc313c26c63fc0f7eaaadf6833b2a7; f6078cba7a7a69f2fae2c8852aa51e145bd97329; 481a696560c52710e3a47a999d84a8516a85a5ff; 7ba18c90be2166a848ab509f9e9de950750a91da; 6116661b3ed8126bd983024c4158b70ae410f88b; b1609ceb28b2c73ce92edd5fe19751ab62bda82f,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,23,449-459
839b500d856ff21db643cbacc279c70ec98e3853,The DNA methylation landscape of CD4+ T cells in oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is presumed to be driven by an adverse combination of genes and environment. Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, act as a conduit through which the environment can regulate gene activity. Altered DNA methylation has been associated with adult autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but studies are lacking for paediatric autoimmune rheumatic diseases including JIA. Here, we performed a genome-scale case-control analysis of CD4+ T cell DNA methylation from 56 oligoarticular JIA (oJIA) cases and 57 age and sex matched controls using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays. DNA methylation at each array probe was tested for association with oJIA using RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation) together with a moderated t-test. Further to this 'all-inclusive' analysis, we stratified by age at diagnosis (â‰¤6yrs, >6yrs) and by sex as potential sources of heterogeneity. Following False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment, no probes were associated with oJIA in the all-inclusive, >6yrs-diagnosed, or sex-stratified analyses, and only one probe was associated with oJIA in the â‰¤6yrs-diagnosed analysis. We attempted technical validation and replication of 14 probes (punadj<0.01) at genes of known/potential relevance to disease. At VPS53, we demonstrated a regional shift towards higher methylation in oJIA (all-inclusive) compared to controls. At REEP3, where polymorphism has been previously associated with JIA, we demonstrated higher DNA methylation in male oJIA compared to male controls. This is the most comprehensive JIA case-control analysis of DNA methylation to date. While we have generated some evidence of altered methylation in oJIA, substantial differences are not apparent in CD4+ T cells. This may indicate a lesser relevance of DNA methylation levels in childhood, compared to adult, rheumatic disease.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Raul A Chavez-Valencia"", ids = ""1441187917""); list(name = ""Rachel C Chiaroni-Clarke"", ids = ""1402822321""); list(name = ""David Martino"", ids = ""6446509""); list(name = ""Jane E.

9a649bc26d6595042c82d02d9569097087dd268b,Time and flow-dependent changes in the p27(kip1) gene network drive maladaptive vascular remodeling.,"OBJECTIVE
Although clinical studies have identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the p27(kip1) gene is associated with success or failure after vein bypass grafting, the underlying mechanisms for this difference are not well defined. Using a high-throughput approach in a flow-dependent vein graft model, we explored the differences in p27(kip1)-related genes that drive the enhanced hyperplastic response under low-flow conditions.


METHODS
Bilateral rabbit carotid artery interposition grafts with jugular vein were placed with a unilateral distal outflow branch ligation to create differential flow states. Grafts were harvested at 2 hours and at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after implantation, measured for neointimal area, and assayed for cell proliferation. Whole-vessel messenger RNA was isolated and analyzed using an Affymetrix (Santa Clara, Calif) gene array platform. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity, Redwood City, Calif) was used to identify the gene networks surrounding p27(kip1). This gene set was then analyzed for temporal expression changes after graft placement and for differential expression in the alternate flow conditions.


RESULTS
Outflow branch ligation resulted in an eightfold difference in mean flow rates throughout the 28-day perfusion period (P < .001). Flow reduction led to a robust hyperplastic response, resulting in a significant increase in intimal area by 7 days (0.13 Â± 0.04 mm(2) vs 0.014 Â± 0.006 mm(2); P < .005) and progressive growth to 28 days (1.37 Â± 0.05 mm(2) vs 0.39 Â± 0.06 mm(2); P < .001). At 7 days, low-flow grafts demonstrated a burst of actively dividing intimal cells (36.4 Â± 9.4 cells/mm(2) vs 11.5 Â± 1.9 cells/mm(2); P = .04). Sixty-five unique genes within the microarray were identified as components of the p27(kip1) network. At a false discovery rate of 0.05, 26 genes demonstrated significant temporal changes, and two dominant patterns of expression were identified. Class comparison analysis identified differential expression of 11 genes at 2 hours and seven genes and 14 days between the high-flow and low-flow grafts (P < .05). At 2 hours, oncostatin M and cadherin 1 were the most differentially expressed. Cadherin 1 and protein kinase B exhibited the greatest differential expression at 14 days.


CONCLUSIONS
Alterations in flow and shear stress result in divergent patterns of vein graft remodeling. Associated with the dramatic increase in neointimal expansion observed in low-flow vs high-flow grafts is a subset of differentially expressed p27(kip1)-associated genes that correlate with critical stages in the adaptive response. These represent potential biologic targets whose activity may be altered to augment maladaptive vascular remodeling.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kenneth Desart"", ids = ""7891532""); list(name = ""Khayree Butler"", ids = ""12062391""); list(name = ""Kerri A.

1bcfc4095f5d68b7ad8f812c2d2466d8b18e721e,Using profileScoreDist,"Position count matrices describe empirical frequencies encountered in short sequence motifs in biological sequences, usually DNA sequences. They are often used to describe transcription factor binding sites, and can be employed to predict binding sites in collections of sequences of interest. For this, typically log-odds scores for matches to a count matrix are computed for each possible location on the sequences of interest. This can be done with the matchPWM from the Biostrings package, for example. How to decide whether a score is large? Often, cutoffs such as 80% of the maximal value are employed. However, it may be desirable with more precise cutoffs. For example, a cutoff corresponding to a 1% probability for one or more false hits for a given sequence (false discovery rate). Or a cutoff corresponding to a 90% probability of discovering a sequence generated by the probabilities inherent in the count matrix, present in a sequence. Rahmann, MÃ¼ller, and Vingron (2003) addressed this problem. This package bring this methodology to R/Bioconductor.",2016,,"list(name = ""PÃ¥l O.

Objective: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is an active endocrine organ that could contribute to the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD) through the paracrine release of proatherogenic mediators. Numerous works have analyzed the inflammatory signature of EAT, but scarce informations on its lipidome are available. Our objective was first to study the differences between EAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) lipidomes and second to identify the specific untargeted lipidomic signatures of EAT and SAT in CAD. Approach and Results: Subcutaneous and EAT untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed in 25 patients with CAD and 14 patients without CAD and compared with paired plasma lipidomic analysis of isolated VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Lipidomics was performed on a C18 column hyphenated to a Q-Exactive plus mass spectrometer, using both positive and negative ionization mode. EAT and SAT had independent lipidomic profile, with 95 lipid species differentially expressed and phosphatidylethanolamine 18:1p/22:6 twenty-fold more expressed in EAT compared with SAT false discovery rate =3Ã—10âˆ’4). Patients with CAD exhibited more ceramides (P=0.01), diglycerides (P=0.004; saturated and nonsaturated), monoglycerides (P=0.013) in their EAT than patients without CAD. Conversely, they had lesser unsaturated TG (triglycerides; P=0.02). No difference was observed in the 295 lipid species found in SAT between patients with and without CAD. Fifty-one lipid species were found in common between EAT and plasma lipoproteins. TG 18:0/18:0/18:1 was found positively correlated (r=0.45, P=0.019) in EAT and HDL and in EAT and VLDL (r=0.46, P=0.02). Conclusions: CAD is associated with specific lipidomic signature of EAT, unlike SAT.

7357b1c0aad32e0479079758d76d9ae70c05a2d0,Metabolic pathway activation distinguishes transcriptional signatures of CD8+ T cells from HIV-1 elite controllers,"Objective: Elite controllers, defined as persons maintaining undetectable levels of HIV-1 replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, represent living evidence that sustained, natural control of HIV-1 is possible, at least in relatively rare instances. Understanding the complex immunologic and virologic characteristics of these specific patients holds promise for inducing drug-free control of HIV-1 in broader populations of HIV-1 infected patients. Design: We used an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to characterize CD8+ T cells, the strongest correlate of HIV-1 immune control identified thus far, in a large cohort of elite controllers (nâ€Š=â€Š51); highly active antiretrovial therapy (HAART)-treated patients (nâ€Š=â€Š32) and HIV-1 negative (nâ€Š=â€Š10) served as reference cohorts. Methods: We isolated mRNA from total CD8+ T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of each individual followed by microarray analysis of the transcriptional signatures. Results: We observed profound transcriptional differences [590 transcripts, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05] between elite controller and HAART-treated patients. Interestingly, metabolic and signalling pathways governed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and eIF2, known for their key roles in regulating cellular growth, proliferation and metabolism, were among the top functions enriched in the differentially expressed genes, suggesting a therapeutically actionable target as a distinguishing feature of spontaneous HIV-1 immune control. A subsequent bootstrapping approach distinguished five different subgroups of elite controller, each characterized by distinct transcriptional signatures. However, despite this marked heterogeneity, differential regulation of mTOR and eIF2 signalling remained the dominant functional pathway in three of these elite controller subgroups. Conclusion: These studies suggest that mTOR and eIF2 signalling may play a remarkably universal role for regulating CD8+ T-cell function from elite controllers.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fatema Z Chowdhury"", ids = ""50339048""); list(name = ""Zhengyu Ouyang"", ids = ""2086721""); list(name = ""Maria J Buzon"", ids = ""4491667""); list(name = ""Bruce D.

4a88b20575bd774cb1b56dad1d8c381d1e0d8bdb,Sleep and cognitive ageing in the 8th decade of life,"We examined associations between self-reported sleep measures and cognitive level and change (age 70-76 years) in a longitudinal, same-year-of-birth cohort study (baseline N = 1,091; longitudinal N = 664). We also leveraged GWAS summary data to ascertain whether polygenic scores (PGS) of chronotype and sleep duration related to self-reported sleep, and to cognitive level and change. Shorter sleep latency was associated with significantly higher levels of visuospatial ability, processing speed, and verbal memory (Î² â‰¥ |0.184|, SE â‰¤ 0.075, p â‰¤ 0.003). Longer daytime sleep duration was significantly associated slower processing speed (Î² = -0.085, SE = 0.027, p = 0.001), and with steeper 6-year decline in visuospatial reasoning (Î² = -0.009, SE = 0.003, p = 0.008), and processing speed (Î² = -0.009, SE = 0.002, p < 0.001). Only longitudinal associations between longer daytime sleeping and steeper cognitive declines survived correction for important health covariates and false discovery rate (FDR). PGS of chronotype and sleep duration were nominally associated with specific self-reported sleep characteristics for most SNP thresholds (standardised Î² range = |0.123 to 0.082|, p range = 0.003 to 0.046), but neither PGS predicted cognitive level or change following FDR. Daytime sleep duration is a potentially important correlate of cognitive decline in visuospatial reasoning and processing speed in older age, whereas cross-sectional associations are partially confounded by important health factors. A genetic propensity toward morningness and sleep duration were weakly, but consistently, related to self-reported sleep characteristics, and did not relate to cognitive level or change.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Simon R.

The data of interest are multivariate timeseries measured simultaneously across brain parcels using resting-state fMRI (rfMRI). We analyze functional connectivity using two heteroscedasticity models. Our first model is low-dimensional and scales linearly in the number of brain parcels. Our second model scales quadratically. We apply both models to data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) comparing connectivity between short and conventional sleepers. We find stronger functional connectivity in short than conventional sleepers in brain areas consistent with previous findings. This might be due to subjects falling asleep in the scanner. Consequently, we recommend the inclusion of average sleep duration as a covariate to remove unwanted variation in rfMRI studies. A power analysis using the HCP data shows that a sample size of 40 detects 50% of the connectivity at a false discovery rate of 20%.

Because of the rarity of CTCcls, molecular characterization of primary tumors that give rise to CTCcl hold significant promise for better diagnosis and target discovery to combat metastatic BC. In our study, we utilized the reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) and transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data of 10 triple-negative BC patient-derived xenograft (TNBC PDX) transplantable models with CTCs and evaluated expression of upregulated candidate protein Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sample-set consisted of six CTCcl-negative (CTCcl-) and four CTCcl-positive (CTCcl+) models. We analyzed the RPPA and transcriptomic profiles of CTCcl- and CTCcl+ TNBC PDX models. In addition, we derived a CTCcl-specific gene signature for testing if it predicted outcomes using a publicly available dataset from 360 patients with basal-like BC. The RPPA analysis of CTCcl+ vs. CTCcl- TNBC PDX tumors revealed elevated expression of Bcl2 (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.0001, fold change (FC) = 3.5) and reduced acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase-1 (ACC1) (FDR = 0.0005, FC = 0.3) in CTCcl+ compared to CTCcl- tumors. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of CTCcl+ vs. CTCcl- tumors revealed 549 differentially expressed genes associated with the presence of CTCcls. Apoptosis was one of the significantly downregulated pathways (normalized enrichment score (NES) = -1.69; FDR < 0.05) in TNBC PDX tumors associated with CTCcl positivity. Two out of four CTCcl+ TNBC PDX primary tumors had high Bcl2 expression by IHC (H-score > 34); whereas, only one of six CTCcl- TNBC PDX primary tumors met this criterion. Evaluation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-specific signature did not show significant differences between CTCcl+ and CTCcl- tumors. However, a gene signature associated with the presence of CTCcls in TNBC PDX models was associated with worse relapse-free survival in the publicly available dataset from 360 patients with basal-like BC. In summary, we identified the multigene signature of primary PDX tumors associated with the presence of CTCcls. Evaluation of additional TNBC PDX models and patients can further illuminate cellular and molecular pathways facilitating CTCcl formation.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hariprasad Thangavel"", ids = ""10399230""); list(name = ""Carmine De Angelis"", ids = ""49950340""); list(name = ""Suhas Vasaikar"", ids = ""48741135""); list(name = ""Raksha R Bhat"", ids = ""33946597""); list(name = ""Mohit Kumar Jolly"", ids = ""35513069""); list(name = ""Chandandeep Nagi"", ids = ""6875519""); list(name = ""Chad J.

97a7f5d3b7cbddbe100d5465f24978ca1333c2dc,Genetic-Epigenetic Interactions in Asthma Revealed by a Genome-Wide Gene-Centric Search,"Objectives: There is evidence to suggest that asthma pathogenesis is affected by both genetic and epigenetic variation independently, and there is some evidence to suggest that genetic-epigenetic interactions affect risk of asthma. However, little research has been done to identify such interactions on a genome-wide scale. The aim of this studies was to identify genes with genetic-epigenetic interactions associated with asthma. Methods: Using asthma case-control data, we applied a novel nonparametric gene-centric approach to test for interactions between multiple SNPs and CpG sites simultaneously in the vicinities of 18,178 genes across the genome. Results: Twelve genes, PF4, ATF3, TPRA1, HOPX, SCARNA18, STC1, OR10K1, UPK1B, LOC101928523, LHX6, CHMP4B, and LANCL1, exhibited statistically significant SNP-CpG interactions (false discovery rate = 0.05). Of these, three have previously been implicated in asthma risk (PF4, ATF3, and TPRA1). Follow-up analysis revealed statistically significant pairwise SNP-CpG interactions for several of these genes, including SCARNA18, LHX6, and LOC101928523 (p = 1.33Eâ€“04, 8.21Eâ€“04, 1.11Eâ€“03, respectively). Conclusions: Joint effects of genetic and epigenetic variation may play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. Statistical methods that simultaneously account for multiple variations across chromosomal regions may be needed to detect these types of effects on a genome-wide scale.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Vladimir Kogan"", ids = ""46883158""); list(name = ""Joshua Millstein"", ids = ""2756932""); list(name = ""Stephanie J London"", ids = ""4166450""); list(name = ""Carole Ober"", ids = ""144458624""); list(name = ""Steven R White"", ids = ""2345484""); list(name = ""Edward T.

7a2899406213986cd7a2e8c3464d70a5370c5f26,High efficiency and quantitatively reproducible protein digestion by trypsin-immobilized magnetic microspheres.,"Aldehyde- and NHS-activated magnetic microspheres were used to immobilize trypsin (CHO-trypsin and NHS-trypsin), and their performance for protein digestion was evaluated by reversed phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument. NHS-trypsin provided greater sequence coverage and identified more peptides for the digestion of bovine serum albumin. A 1-min digestion at room temperature using the immobilized trypsin also identified more peptides (96Â±6 vs. 48Â±1) and produced higher sequence coverage (90Â±2% vs. 75Â±2%) than traditional free trypsin digestion for 12h at 37 Â°C. Analysis of 15 nM (0.001 mg/mL) BSA digested by NHS-trypsin in 1 min at room temperature consistently yielded one detected peptide; 150 nM BSA generated 22 peptides. Peptide intensity and protein spectral count were used to evaluate the run-to-run digestion reproducibility of NHS-trypsin with a three-protein-mixture. Three high intensity peptides for each protein generated intensity ratios from 0.70 to 1.09 and spectral count ratios from 0.78 to 1.18. Finally, RAW 264.7 cell lysates were digested by NHS-trypsin for 10 min and 30 min at room temperature, 604 and 697 protein groups, respectively, were identified by RPLC-ESI-MS/MS, with a peptide false discovery rate of less than 1%.

To explore prognostic and predictive value of radiomics in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (LAHNSCC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or bioradiotherapy (BRT).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data of 120 patients (CRT vs. BRT matched 2:1) were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 544 radiomics features of the primary tumor were extracted from radiotherapy planning computed tomography scans. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between survival and radiomics features with false discovery rate correction. The discriminatory performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.


RESULTS
Multivariate analysis showed a 24-feature based signature significantly predicted for OS (HR=0.3, P=0.02) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR=0.3, P=0.01). Combining the radiomics signature with p16 status showed a significant improvement of prognostic performance compared with p16 (AUC=0.78vs. AUC=0.64 at 5years, P=0.01) or radiomics signature (AUC=0.78vs. AUC=0.67, P=0.01) alone. When patients were stratified according to this combination, OS and PFS were significantly different according to the 4 sub-types (p16+ with low/high signature score; p16- with low/high signature score) (P<0.001). Patients with high signature score significantly benefited from CRT (vs. BRT) in terms of OS (P=0.004), while no benefit from CRT in patients with low signature score.


CONCLUSION
Our analysis suggests an added value of radiomics features as prognostic and predictive biomarker in HNSCC treated with CRT/BRT. Moreover, the radiomics signature provided additional information to HPV/p16 status to further stratify patients.

ca1efaa0768dd2ca5466c05fc7e3d0bacb1bd801,Is there a relation between asthma associated gene polymorphisms and recurrent wheezing in preschool children? The ADEM study,"Background: About 20-40% of preschool children experience wheezing. One in three wheezers will have persistent symptoms after the age of six and develop asthma. It is unknown which gene variants contribute to wheezing.

Aim: To explore the relation between asthma associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and preschool recurrent wheezers.

Methods: We selected 202 recurrent wheezers (ISAAC questionnaire â‰¥2 wheezing episodes) and 50 controls aged 2-4 years. Saliva and buccal swaps were used for DNA extraction. Chi square tests were performed on 23 SNPs in 15 genes. Results were expressed in unadjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval. Multiple testing was corrected by the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate.

Results: In total 134 boys and 116 girls participated with an average age of 3.3 years. All SNPs had a high call rate (94.0-99.2%). The frequencies of a genetic variant in ADAM33 (rs511898) differed statistically significantly between cases and controls leading to OR=2.4 (1.2-4.9) for CT genotype and OR=1.0 (0.4-2.5) for TT genotype compared to CC genotype (p=0.03). The frequencies of a genetic variant in ORMLD3 (rs7216389) differed statistically significant between cases and controls leading to OR=3.7 (1.7-8.2) for CT genotype and OR=2.7 (1.2-6.3) for TT genotype compared to CC genotype (p<0.01). Neither remained statistically significant after multiple testing correction (rs511898 p=0.36, rs7216389 p=0.07).

Conclusions: We observed some evidence for the association of the ORMDL3 SNP rs7216389 and recurrent wheeze. The T-allele was more frequent in recurrent wheezers, which is consistent with previous studies in asthma.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ester M. M.

c62f0cb47c39c0d3b8a0e1af8343eb9cb3896a01,Temporal Hierarchical Adaptive Texture CRF for Automatic Detection of Gadolinium-Enhancing Multiple Sclerosis Lesions in Brain MRI,"We propose a conditional random field (CRF) based classifier for segmentation of small enhanced pathologies. Specifically, we develop a temporal hierarchical adaptive texture CRF (THAT-CRF) and apply it to the challenging problem of gad enhancing lesion segmentation in brain MRI of patients with multiple sclerosis. In this context, the presence of many nonlesion enhancements (such as blood vessels) renders the problem more difficult. In addition to voxel-wise features, the framework exploits multiple higher order textures to discriminate the true lesional enhancements from the pool of other enhancements. Since lesional enhancements show more variation over time as compared to the nonlesional ones, we incorporate temporal texture analysis in order to study the textures of enhanced candidates over time. The parameters of the THAT-CRF model are learned based on 2380 scans from a multi-center clinical trial. The effect of different components of the model is extensively evaluated on 120 scans from a separate multi-center clinical trial. The incorporation of the temporal textures results in a general decrease of the false discovery rate. Specifically, THAT-CRF achieves overall sensitivity of 95% along with false discovery rate of 20% and average false positive count of 0.5 lesions per scan. The sensitivity of the temporal method to the trained time interval is further investigated on five different intervals of 69 patients. Moreover, superior performance is achieved by the reviewed labelings of our model compared to the fully manual labeling when applied to the context of separating different treatment arms in a real clinical trial.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zahra Karimaghaloo"", ids = ""1732626""); list(name = ""Hassan Rivaz"", ids = ""1717721""); list(name = ""Douglas L.

6bc6b1c333cd18a20abcfc179c6e143bc4910348,Neuroanatomical and Symptomatic Sex Differences in Individuals at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis,"Sex differences have been widely observed in clinical presentation, functional outcome and neuroanatomy in individuals with a first-episode of psychosis, and chronic patients suffering from schizophrenia. However, little is known about sex differences in the high-risk stages for psychosis. The present study investigated sex differences in cortical and subcortical neuroanatomy in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis and healthy controls (CTL), and the relationship between anatomy and clinical symptoms in males at CHR. Magnetic resonance images were collected in 26 individuals at CHR (13 men) and 29 CTLs (15 men) to determine total and regional brain volumes and morphology, cortical thickness, and surface area (SA). Clinical symptoms were assessed with the brief psychiatric rating scale. Significant sex-by-diagnosis interactions were observed with opposite directions of effect in male and female CHR subjects relative to their same-sex controls in multiple cortical and subcortical areas. The right postcentral, left superior parietal, inferior parietal supramarginal, and angular gyri [<5% false discovery rate (FDR)] were thicker in male and thinner in female CHR subjects compared with their same-sex CTLs. The same pattern was observed in the right superior parietal gyrus SA at the regional and vertex level. Using a recently developed surface-based morphology pipeline, we observed sex-specific shape differences in the left hippocampus (<5% FDR) and amygdala (<10% FDR). Negative symptom burden was significantly higher in male compared with female CHR subjects (pâ€‰=â€‰0.04) and was positively associated with areal expansion of the left amygdala in males (<5% FDR). Some limitations of the study include the sample size, and data acquisition at 1.5â€‰T. This study demonstrates neuroanatomical sex differences in CHR subjects, which may be associated with variations in symptomatology in men and women with psychotic symptoms.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elisa Guma"", ids = ""48288493""); list(name = ""Gabriel A.

1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444,Slope-adaptive Variable Selection via Convex Optimization.,"We introduce a new estimator for the vector of coefficients Î² in the linear model y = XÎ² + z, where X has dimensions n Ã— p with p possibly larger than n. SLOPE, short for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation, is the solution to [Formula: see text]where Î»1 â‰¥ Î»2 â‰¥ â€¦ â‰¥ Î» p â‰¥ 0 and [Formula: see text] are the decreasing absolute values of the entries of b. This is a convex program and we demonstrate a solution algorithm whose computational complexity is roughly comparable to that of classical â„“1 procedures such as the Lasso. Here, the regularizer is a sorted â„“1 norm, which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank-that is, stronger the signal-the larger the penalty. This is similar to the Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B57 (1995) 289-300] procedure (BH) which compares more significant p-values with more stringent thresholds. One notable choice of the sequence {Î» i } is given by the BH critical values [Formula: see text], where q âˆˆ (0, 1) and z(Î±) is the quantile of a standard normal distribution. SLOPE aims to provide finite sample guarantees on the selected model; of special interest is the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the expected proportion of irrelevant regressors among all selected predictors. Under orthogonal designs, SLOPE with Î»BH provably controls FDR at level q. Moreover, it also appears to have appreciable inferential properties under more general designs X while having substantial power, as demonstrated in a series of experiments running on both simulated and real data.",2015,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""MaÅ‚gorzata Maria Bogdan"", ids = ""152623104""); list(name = ""Ewout van den Berg"", ids = ""115850808""); list(name = ""C.

2ed3279c0f1337d51b13f93156ccbf44da277f46,ProSolo: Accurate Variant Calling from Single Cell DNA Sequencing Data,"Obtaining accurate mutational profiles from single cell DNA is essential for the analysis of genomic cell-to-cell heterogeneity at the finest level of resolution. However, sequencing libraries suitable for genotyping require whole genome amplification, which introduces allelic bias and copy errors. As a result, single cell DNA sequencing data violates the assumptions of variant callers developed for bulk sequencing, which when applied to single cells generate significant numbers of false positives and false negatives. Only dedicated models accounting for amplification bias and errors will be able to provide more accurate calls. We present ProSolo, a probabilistic model for calling single nucleotide variants from multiple displacement amplified single cell DNA sequencing data. It introduces a mechanistically motivated empirical model of amplification bias that improves the quantification of genotyping uncertainty. To account for amplification errors, it jointly models the single cell sample with a bulk sequencing sample from the same cell populationâ€”also enabling a biologically relevant imputation of missing genotypes for the single cell. Through these innovations, ProSolo achieves substantially higher performance in calling and genotyping single nucleotide variants in single cells in comparison to all state-of-the-art tools. Moreover, ProSolo implements the first approach to control the false discovery rate reliably and flexibly; not only for single nucleotide variant calls, but also for artefacts of single cell methodology that one may wish to identify, such as allele dropout. ProSoloâ€™s model is implemented into a flexible framework, encouraging extensions.

e192ff0551737ec163cfb09bc5e47798d4153cbc,Differential methylation of genes in individuals exposed to maternal diabetes in utero,"Aims/hypothesisIndividuals exposed to maternal diabetes in utero are more likely to develop metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life. This may be partially attributable to epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to examine whether differential DNA methylation, a major source of epigenetic regulation, can be observed in offspring of mothers with type 2 diabetes during the pregnancy (OMD) compared with offspring of mothers with no diabetes during the pregnancy (OMND).MethodsDNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. A total of 423,311 CpG sites were analysed in 388 Pima Indian individuals, mean age at examination was 13.0Â years, 187 of whom were OMD and 201 were OMND. Differences in methylation between OMD and OMND were assessed.ResultsForty-eight differentially methylated CpG sites (with an empirical false discovery rate â‰¤0.05), mapping to 29 genes and ten intergenic regions, were identified. The gene with the strongest evidence was LHX3, in which six CpG sites were hypermethylated in OMD compared with OMND (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5). Similarly, a CpG near PRDM16 was hypermethylated in OMD (1.1% higher, pâ€‰=â€‰5.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’7), where hypermethylation also predicted future diabetes risk (HR 2.12 per SD methylation increase, pâ€‰=â€‰9.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5). Hypermethylation near AK3 and hypomethylation at PCDHGA4 and STC1 were associated with exposure to diabetes in utero (AK3: 2.5% higher, pâ€‰=â€‰7.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’6; PCDHGA4: 2.8% lower, pâ€‰=â€‰3.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5; STC1: 2.9% lower, pâ€‰=â€‰1.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5) and decreased insulin secretory function among offspring with normal glucose tolerance (AK3: 0.088 SD lower per SD of methylation increase, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; PCDHGA4: 0.08 lower SD per SD of methylation decrease, pâ€‰=â€‰0.03; STC1: 0.072 SD lower per SD of methylation decrease, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). Seventeen CpG sites were also associated with BMI (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05). Pathway analysis of the genes with at least one differentially methylated CpG (pâ€‰<â€‰0.005) showed enrichment for three relevant biological pathways.Conclusions/interpretationIntrauterine exposure to diabetes can affect methylation at multiple genomic sites. Methylation status at some of these sites can impair insulin secretion, increase body weight and increase risk of type 2 diabetes.",2016,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Peng Chen"", ids = ""1744774""); list(name = ""Paolo Piaggi"", ids = ""1936069""); list(name = ""Michael T Traurig"", ids = ""4169695""); list(name = ""Clifton Bogardus"", ids = ""145952870""); list(name = ""William C Knowler"", ids = ""6211003""); list(name = ""Leslie J.

1d3684e32ef8fc62a7a476146dd02a95900df79a,Optimized Next-Generation Sequencing Genotype-Haplotype Calling for Genome Variability Analysis,"The accurate estimation of nucleotide variability using next-generation sequencing data is challenged by the high number of sequencing errors produced by new sequencing technologies, especially for nonmodel species, where reference sequences may not be available and the read depth may be low due to limited budgets. The most popular single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) callers are designed to obtain a high SNP recovery and low false discovery rate but are not designed to account appropriately the frequency of the variants. Instead, algorithms designed to account for the frequency of SNPs give precise results for estimating the levels and the patterns of variability. These algorithms are focused on the unbiased estimation of the variability and not on the high recovery of SNPs. Here, we implemented a fast and optimized parallel algorithm that includes the method developed by Roesti et al and Lynch, which estimates the genotype of each individual at each site, considering the possibility to call both bases from the genotype, a single one or none. This algorithm does not consider the reference and therefore is independent of biases related to the reference nucleotide specified. The pipeline starts from a BAM file converted to pileup or mpileup format and the software outputs a FASTA file. The new program not only reduces the running times but also, given the improved use of resources, it allows its usage with smaller computers and large parallel computers, expanding its benefits to a wider range of researchers. The output file can be analyzed using software for population genetics analysis, such as the R library PopGenome, the software VariScan, and the program mstatspop for analysis considering positions with missing data.",2017,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Javier Navarro"", ids = ""144741038""); list(name = ""Bruno Nevado"", ids = ""3311616""); list(name = ""Porfidio HernÃ¡ndez"", ids = ""37730177""); list(name = ""Gonzalo Vera"", ids = ""49787477""); list(name = ""SebastiÃ¡n E.

b48da3e009c697226e72b0e9767d04ce14d6e120,Influence Of Genetic Variation On Metabolic Outcomes Among Survivors Of Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation,"Background Childhood hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors have been shown to be at increased risk for a variety of long-term cardiometabolic sequelae. However, it is unclear if genetic factors can modify the levels of various quantitative cardiometabolic traits in this population.

Methods Prospective cross-sectional study of â‰¥2-year survivors of pediatric allogeneic (n=47) or autologous (n=27) HCT recruited from two centers. Allogeneic HCT survivors had to be free of chronic GVHD and off immunosuppression at time of assessment. All participants underwent detailed physiologic measurements (euglycemic insulin clamp, body composition assessments, blood pressure, fasting lipids) and also provided DNA samples (both donor and host if allogeneic HCT recipient). A panel of carefully annotated genes and respective single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with each cardiometabolic trait (fat mass, body mass index, insulin resistance, triglyceride, HDL and LDL cholesterol) was assembled based on evidence from the general population using the Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) Navigator (accessed March 2013). For each trait, we estimated the least square mean values and determined the overall and pairwise p-values among genotypes. Multiple comparisons were controlled for using Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s false discovery rate. For initial validation, a separate dataset of 134 â‰¥2-year pediatric allogeneic HCT survivors without active chronic GVHD and retrospectively collected phenotypes was available.

Results Among the primary study participants (n=74), 73% were exposed to total body irradiation, and their median current age was 24 years (range 10-50), with median interval since HCT of 11.4 years (range 2.6-27.6). 95% of these survivors self-reported White non-Hispanic race/ethnicity. Host polymorphisms in LPL (rs319; p=0.0009) and ADRB2 (rs12654778; p=0.002) were found to be significantly associated with differences in triglyceride levels and body mass index, respectively. While several other genes (all host) had SNPs that were associated with various outcomes (e.g. ADIPOQ and insulin resistance, CETP with both HDL and LDL-cholesterol; all p<0.01), none met statistical significance as defined by the false discovery rate ([Table][1]). No donor polymorphisms was found to be associated. Among the validation sample (74% exposed to total body irradiation, 100% White non-Hispanic), host rs319 had no association with triglyceride levels (p=0.81). An effort to validate the other polymorphisms listed above is ongoing.

Distribution of host genotypes associated (overall p-value <0.01) with cardiometabolic traits of interest.



Conclusion It is possible that underlying genetic factors may influence subsequent development of adverse metabolic traits, even among heavily treated childhood cancer survivors. However, any associations require further validation. Furthermore, the relatively small numbers of such patients at most centers limit the power of such genetic investigations. Future efforts should focus on developing appropriate consortia in which samples may be pooled. Application of rigorous phenotype definitions may also enhance the likelihood of identifying true genetic associations.

505abe0141338389e7ac96730dfe550b041e975c,Benchmarking Danish hospitals on mortality and readmission rates after cardiovascular admission,"Objective
The aim of this study was to examine hospital performance measures that account more comprehensively for unique mixes of patients' characteristics.


Design
Nationwide cohort registry-based study within a population-based health care system.


Participants
In this study, 331,513 patients discharged with a primary cardiovascular diagnosis from 1 of 26 Danish hospitals during 2011-2015 were included. Data covering all Danish hospitals were drawn from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish National Health Service Prescription Database.


Main outcome measures
Thirty-day post-admission mortality rates, 30-day post-discharge readmission rates, and the associated numbers needed to harm were measured.


Methods
For each index hospital, we used a non-parametric logistic regression model to compute propensity scores. Propensity score weighted patients treated at other hospitals collectively resembled patients treated at the index hospital in terms of age, sex, primary discharge diagnosis, diagnosis history, medications, previous cardiac procedures, and comorbidities. Outcomes for the weighted patients treated at other hospitals formed benchmarks for the index hospital. Doubly robust regression formally tested whether the outcomes of patients at the index hospital differed from the outcomes of the patients used to form the benchmarks. For each index hospital, we computed the false discovery rate, ie, the probability of being incorrect if we claimed the hospital differed from its benchmark.


Results
Five hospitals exceeded their benchmark for 30-day mortality rates, with the number needed to harm ranging between 55 and 137. Seven hospitals exceeded their benchmark for readmission, with the number needed to harm ranging from 22 to 71. Our benchmarking approach flagged fewer hospitals as outliers compared with conventional regression methods.


Conclusion
Conventional methods flag more hospitals as outliers than our benchmarking approach.

abd77743c49da5b18f8524df2d7d155bc3e700e1,Relationships between hippocampal shape and cognitive performances in drug-naÃ¯ve patients with Alzheimer's disease,"Previous studies provided hippocampal shape analysis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using automated segmentation techniques. However, the relationships between the hippocampal deformations and various cognitive impairments were not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate hippocampal shape changes and their relationship to cognitive impairments. Fifty-one drug-naÃ¯ve patients with AD and 50 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3T MRI scanning, and the hippocampal volumes and deformations were compared between the groups. Additionally, we explored the correlation pattern between the hippocampal deformations and the cognitive dysfunctions in AD using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-K). AD subjects exhibited significant hippocampal deformations in the cornu ammnonis (CA1) and subiculum areas compared to those in healthy subjects (p<0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). Significant correlations were observed between hippocampal deformations in CA1 and subiculum areas and verbal immediate recall, verbal delayed recall, verbal recognition memory, and constructional recall scores (p<0.05, FDR corrected). This study was the first to explore the relationships between hippocampal deformations and various cognitive impairments of drug-naÃ¯ve patients with AD. These structural changes in hippocampal CA1 and subiculum areas might be the core of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction and their relevance to the various cognitive dysfunctions in AD.",2012,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hyun Kook Lim"", ids = ""3260937""); list(name = ""Won sang Jung"", ids = ""3170703""); list(name = ""Kook Jin Ahn"", ids = ""144934470""); list(name = ""Wang Youn Won"", ids = ""6362785""); list(name = ""Chang Uk Lee"", ids = ""6038692"")",bbfe01647d86eca8837484cfb6a3b5fecf84c545; 304d2d11e50fb0756818823e98b5169ad549c740; e7b8511c2007d4c5fe28a6d88df94efe10988922; 9f76f4168355577c10373affa089a37275c74fd7; 8a0affb3718e3336e61b4d3c468c38ee09c1f1bd; 1591a999e382b20925ee73e46eed412794727781; d6c3db578f285e387cc9abfca03d182722c4de70; acc3bee5e8865b7b76ba84d5e06bef125072ed94; ab2e77df3b756a30d7392a7fbd8b4c90dd9fb6a6; 0b86b9867bb0ac3e9f48b018c31f76ea30fd87f2; 5c5f278150857ffbbefe4adb10d5da85afec1242; 34070201df6c6831146634ea88bbc6f9538688a4; f90d79423d2e1d2c8e9edb1f6bb2ef7411b876c4; b8b5a94e09973e1789a9f47a44ba38de3e798fe5; d068db2e2ee30810be2e1338e400b887b44cf53a; 092f46a4a66d97b221c777db2f91dda52391a928; 3c45fbf7b1ca2e3d86e4793c6ea18d551c169ea4,,Neuroscience Letters,516,124-129
0397cbd788a0de73aa87fb2f2b6c3cff2f746795,Variation of Gut Mucosal Microbiome with ASCA Status in Pediatric Crohn's Disease.,"OBJECTIVES
Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing condition possibly caused by a dysbiotic microbiome. About 30-60% of CD patients have antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), but any association with gut microbiota is unexplored. We hypothesized that ASCA positivity would predict a signature microbial status and clinical phenotype.


METHODS
Ileocolonic mucosal biopsies were obtained from children with CD (nâ€Š=â€Š135), and controls without inflammatory bowel disease (nâ€Š=â€Š45). Comparison was made between ASCA status, microbial diversity and clinical characteristics.


RESULTS
ASCA was highly specific but poorly sensitive for the diagnosis of CD. In patients with CD, ASCA positivity was associated with older age (â‰¥10 years), ileocolonic disease and long-term risk of surgery. Microbial alpha and beta diversity were similar in CD patients with or without ASCA, but significantly less when compared to non-IBD controls. Microbial richness was similar across all three groups. Fourteen bacterial species were associated with ASCA positive CD patients and 14 species with ASCA negative patients (pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). After using a false discovery rate correction Ruminococcus torques and bacterium Yersinia enterolitica 61 remained significantly associated with CD ASCA positivity (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0178), while Enterobacter cloacae and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly associated with CD ASCA negativity (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0178 and 0.0342).


CONCLUSION
ASCA positive and ASCA negative CD patients have significant differences in gut microbiome composition, which could possibly be influencing the phenotype of the disease.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shivani Kansal"", ids = ""48710778""); list(name = ""Anthony G Catto-Smith"", ids = ""1416698225""); list(name = ""Karen Boniface"", ids = ""49950651""); list(name = ""Sarah L.

5afe68fb212b0b3e12821cc2c5040dbf4e10d832,Eight genes are highly associated with BMD variation in postmenopausal Caucasian women.,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is an important risk factor for skeletal fractures which occur in about 40% of women >/=50 years in the western world. We describe the transcriptional changes in 84 trans-iliacal bone biopsies associated with BMD variations in postmenopausal females (50 to 86 years), aiming to identify genetic determinants of bone structure. The women were healthy or having a primary osteopenic or osteoporotic status with or without low energy fractures. The total cohort of 91 unrelated women representing a wide range of BMDs, were consecutively registered and submitted to global gene Affymetrix microarray expression analysis or histomorphometry. Among almost 23,000 expressed transcripts, a set represented by ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3), NIPSNAP3B (nipsnap homolog 3B), DLEU2 (Deleted in lymphocytic leukemia, 2), C1ORF61 (Chromosome 1 open reading frame 61), DKK1 (Dickkopf homolog 1), SOST (Sclerostin), ABCA8, (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 8), and uncharacterized (AFFX-M27830-M-at), was significantly correlated to total hip BMD (5% false discovery rate) explaining 62% of the BMD variation expressed as T-score, 53% when adjusting for the influence of age (Z-score) and 44% when further adjusting for body mass index (BMI). Only SOST was previously associated to BMD, and the majority of the genes have previously not been associated with a bone phenotype. In molecular network analyses, SOST shows a strong, positive correlation with DKK1, both being members of the Wnt signaling pathway. The results provide novel insight in the underlying biology of bone metabolism and osteoporosis which is the ultimate consequence of low BMD.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sjur Reppe"", ids = ""6658599""); list(name = ""Hilde Refvem"", ids = ""14616600""); list(name = ""Vigdis T.

2c4a269867a379c465df81e4c073ac253de4d74a,Smoking-Associated Site-Specific Differential Methylation in Buccal Mucosa in the COPDGene Study.,"DNA methylation is a complex, tissue-specific phenomenon that can reflect both endogenous factors and exogenous exposures. Buccal brushings represent an easily accessible source of DNA, which may be an appropriate surrogate tissue in the study of environmental exposures and chronic respiratory diseases. Buccal brushings were obtained from a subset of current and former smokers from the COPDGene study. Genome-wide DNA methylation data were obtained in the discovery cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰82) using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K array. Empirical Bayes methods were used to test for differential methylation by current smoking status at 468,219 autosomal CpG sites using linear models adjusted for age, sex, and race. Pyrosequencing was performed in a nonoverlapping replication cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰130). Current smokers were significantly younger than former smokers in both the discovery and replication cohorts. Seven CpG sites were associated with current smoking at a false discovery rate less than 0.05 in the discovery cohort. Six of the seven significant sites were pyrosequenced in the replication cohort; five CpG sites, including sites annotated to CYP1B1 and PARVA, were replicated. Correlations between cumulative smoke exposure and time since smoking cessation were observed in a subset of the significantly associated CpG sites. A significant correlation between reduced lung function and increased radiographic emphysema with methylation at cg02162897 (CYP1B1) was observed among female subjects. Site-specific methylation of DNA isolated from buccal mucosa is associated with exposure to cigarette smoke, and may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying differential susceptibility toward the development of smoking-related chronic respiratory diseases.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Emily S.

Radiation-induced fibrosis, an adverse effect of breast cancer treatment, is associated with functional and cosmetic impairment as well as surgical complications. Clinical reports suggest improvement following autologous fat transplantation, but the mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. A global gene expression analysis was undertaken to identify genetic pathways dysregulated by radiation and evaluate the impact of autologous fat transplantation on gene expression.


METHODS
Adipose tissue biopsies were taken synchronously from irradiated and contralateral non-irradiated breasts, before and 1â€‰year after autologous fat transplantation. Whole-genome gene expression analyses were performed, and Hallmark gene set analysis used to explore the effect of radiotherapy and autologous fat transplantation on gene expression.


RESULTS
Forty microarrays were analysed, using bilateral biopsies taken from ten patients before and after autologous fat transplantation. Forty-five pathways were identified among the 3000 most dysregulated transcripts after radiotherapy in irradiated compared with non-irradiated breast (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0Â·023; false discovery rate (FDR) no higher than 0Â·026). After autologous fat transplantation, 575 of the 3000 genes were again altered. Thirteen pathways (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0Â·013; FDR 0Â·050 or less) were identified; the top two canonical pathways were interferon-Î³ response and hypoxia. Correlative immunohistochemistry showed increased macrophage recruitment in irradiated tissues.


CONCLUSION
The present findings contribute to understanding of how autologous fat transplantation can ameliorate radiation-induced fibrosis. This further supports the use of autologous fat transplantation in the treatment of radiation-induced fibrosis. Surgical relevance Clinical studies have indicated that autologous fat transplantation (AFT) stimulates regression of chronic inflammation and fibrosis caused by radiotherapy in skin and subcutaneous fat. However, there is a paucity of biological evidence and the underlying processes are poorly understood. Human data are scarce, whereas experimental studies have focused mainly either on the effect of irradiation or AFT alone. The present results indicate that radiotherapy causes dysregulated gene expression in fibrosis-related pathways in adipose tissues in humans.

12b7570889803ac6c203fd7f75babecfa9fb2a4e,Evaluation of proteomic biomarkers associated with circulating microparticles as an effective means to stratify the risk of spontaneousÂ preterm birth.,"BACKGROUND
The analysis of circulating microparticles in pregnancy is of revolutionary potential because it represents an inÂ vivo biopsy of active gestational tissues.


OBJECTIVE
We hypothesized that circulating microparticle signaling will differ in pregnancies that experience spontaneous preterm birth from those delivering at term and that these differences will be evident many weeks in advance of clinical presentation.


STUDY DESIGN
Utilizing plasma specimens obtained between 10 and 12 weeks' gestation as part of a prospectively collected birth cohort in which pregnancy outcomes are independently validated by 2 board-certified maternal-fetal medicine physicians, 25 singleton cases of spontaneous preterm birth â‰¤ 34 weeks were matched by maternal age, race, and gestational age of sampling (Â±2 weeks) with 50 uncomplicated term deliveries. Circulating microparticles from these first-trimester specimens were isolated and analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry for potential protein biomarkers following previous studies. Markers with robust univariate performance in correlating spontaneous preterm birth were further evaluated for their biological relevance via a combined functional profiling/pathway analysis and for multivariate performance.


RESULTS
Among the 132 proteins evaluated, 62 demonstrated robust power of detecting spontaneous preterm birth in a bootstrap receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis at a false discovery rate of <Â 20% estimated via label permutation. Differential dependency network analysis identified spontaneous preterm birth-associated coexpression patterns linked to biological processes of inflammation, wound healing, and the coagulation cascade. Linear modeling of spontaneous preterm birth using a multiplex of the candidate biomarkers with a fixed sensitivity of 80% exhibited a specificity of 83% with median area under the curve of 0.89. These results indicate a strong potential of multivariate model development for informative risk stratification.


CONCLUSION
This project has identified functional proteomic factors with associated biological processes that are already unique in their expression profiles at 10-12 weeks among women who go on to deliver spontaneously â‰¤ 34 weeks. These changes, with further validation, will allow the stratification of patients at risk of spontaneous preterm birth before clinical presentation.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""David E.

6ec534cdb83fe64161d260f0fbd5bffa75a556dc,High-sensitivity HLA class I peptidome analysis enables a precise definition of peptide motifs and the identification of peptides from cell lines and patients' sera.,"The characterization of peptides bound to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I is of fundamental importance for understanding CD8+ T cell-driven immunological processes and for the development of immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies. However, until now, the mass spectrometric analysis of HLA-bound peptides has typically required billions of cells, still resulting in relatively few high-confidence peptide identifications. Capitalizing on the recent developments in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, we have implemented a methodology for the efficient recovery of acid-eluted HLA peptides after purification with the pan-reactive antibody W6/32 and have identified a total of 27 862 unique peptides with high confidence (1% false discovery rate) from five human cancer cell lines. More than 93% of the identified peptides were eight to 11 amino acids in length and contained signatures that were in excellent agreement with published HLA binding motifs. Furthermore, by purifying soluble HLA class I complexes (sHLA) from sera of melanoma patients, up to 972 high-confidence peptides could be identified, including melanoma-associated antigens already described in the literature. Knowledge of the HLA class I peptidome should facilitate multiplex tetramer technology-based characterization of T cells, and allow the development of patient selection, stratification and immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Danilo Ritz"", ids = ""32464393""); list(name = ""Andreas Gloger"", ids = ""4274161""); list(name = ""Benjamin Weide"", ids = ""3631833""); list(name = ""Claus Garbe"", ids = ""145125896""); list(name = ""Dario Neri"", ids = ""144526984""); list(name = ""Tim Fugmann"", ids = ""2191451"")",398b796ef28758d0e0c8730d0ac75b6a0658ea8f; 87a03f6f53685904d85a09a28001e8bd0ddff80b; 4205cfd46932fc5d82f66074386766bda3b73d34; 413d6122b22e9af0b02b7f12107c2135e833c34f; b9173a14cf757cc10ab54716585dbe1a6ac69976; d1426149b34362170b331f55500a7c02374d7e7f; 6cbbc0fbbd13625023594527f5d283d4c7b50b2e; 1fdb7c211364387219b51124c2db0b93021b4cfc; 1413944f3b728858e28f7505c2bec625f7b8ecb9; c3fa377ce780e7d68f92c4c1af6d218d163fcdb3; aa51ea3b499d4690b5107359909a7adc65487aea; 4415d653c94bb130b2990202cc3cfc09f670d4a1; 0f8e9ca413f0ac4dcb369d276ac1f8c56040d118; 56cc7afa76e1fac91b1b99f2235cb05cbd963383; 79f56e4f392cd9278aae5ab7fb1faea9a56422f6; 433d810daa8c2280503d28203e5eece473409b89; bfeeb2d0fbd0ff9b8b43f3e697972a9f1d782721; 12aa5b31507cf50cf06a714059095db180643f6c; 725f5ffc367011151512d81b7eb9c6fcfbf7cc57; a94352cef40fbe745efdcd73b8f0bbd1a07da24e; 72a04520f462dc5c897d5e8e937a92747c92298f; dfe6cf471c8cec7fe24eefa4641fd44ffd7de77f; 7eac809b01b7df5306553a4231c91021c29f8918; 6f787aca77f92c5f05f0ad1f6ffb0f44d198ae8f; 05200f537fc6e6111fca797443a429d21eaaef2a; 9cdaace3ee36051a093f111570b2d5cd3fe2d094; 8f6c22dbc7655a57cd0ca0ae2f5e62746e692017,,Proteomics,16 10,"

d38fec6019fb2eadc3ea5099ffc7e26c2fef238e,Development of White Matter Circuitry in Infants With Fragile X Syndrome,"Importance Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder and the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability in males. However, there are no published data on brain development in children with FXS during infancy. Objective To characterize the development of white matter at ages 6, 12, and 24 months in infants with FXS compared with that of typically developing controls. Design, Setting, and Participants Longitudinal behavioral and brain imaging data were collected at 1 or more time points from 27 infants with FXS and 73 typically developing controls between August 1, 2008, and June 14, 2016, at 2 academic medical centers. Infants in the control group had no first- or second-degree relatives with intellectual or psychiatric disorders, including FXS and autism spectrum disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures Nineteen major white matter pathways were defined in common atlas space based on anatomically informed methods. Diffusion parameters, including fractional anisotropy, were compared between groups using linear mixed effects modeling. Fiber pathways showing group differences were subsequently examined in association with direct measures of verbal and nonverbal development. Results There were significant differences in the development of 12 of 19 fiber tracts between the 27 infants with FXS (22 boys and 5 girls) and the 73 infants in the control group (46 boys and 27 girls), with lower fractional anisotropy in bilateral subcortical-frontal, occipital-temporal, temporal-frontal, and cerebellar-thalamic pathways, as well as 4 of 6 subdivisions of the corpus callosum. For all 12 of these pathways, there were significant main effects between groups but not for the interaction of ageâ€‰Ã—â€‰group, indicating that lower fractional anisotropy was present and stable from age 6 months in infants with FXS. Lower fractional anisotropy values in the uncinate fasciculi were correlated with lower nonverbal developmental quotient in the FXS group (left uncinate, Fâ€‰=â€‰10.06; false discovery rateâ€“corrected Pâ€‰=â€‰.03; right uncinate, Fâ€‰=â€‰21.8; Pâ€‰=â€‰.004). Conclusions and Relevance The results substantiate in human infants the essential role of fragile X gene expression in the early development of white matter. The findings also suggest that the neurodevelopmental effects of FXS are well established at 6 months of age.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Meghan R.

The workshop focused on discussing modern methods for analysis complex high dimensional data with applications to econometrics, finance, biomedicine, genomics etc. Mathematics Subject Classification (2000): 62G,62H,68T. Introduction by the Organisers The workshop New Inference Concepts for Analysing Complex Data, organised by Jianqing Fan (Chapel Hill ), Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller (Berlin) and Vladimir Spokoiny (Berlin) was held November 14stâ€“November 20th, 2004. This meeting was well attended with about 45 participants with broad geographic representation from all continents. This workshop was a nice blend of researchers with various backgrounds from the areas of statistics and machine learning. The main purpose of this workshop was to assemble international leaders from statistics and machine learning in the Institute: to identify important research problems, to cross-fertilize between the disciplines, and to ultimately start coordinated research efforts towards better solutions. The program included more than 25 talks organized in sections on various topics: Support Vector Machines (B. SchÃ¶lkopf, A.J. Smola, G.Wahba), mathematical finance (H. Dette, W. HÃ¤rdle, S.X. Chen), dimension reduction (Y. Xia, A. Dalalyan, M. Kawanabe, E. Mammen, H. H. Zhang), non-parametric smoothing (D. Belomestny, J. Polzehl), Boosting (P. BÃ¼hlmann, Y. Ritov), genomics (A. Nobel, Hepping Zhang), classification (S. van de Geer, G. Blanchard), statistical inverse problem (M. Reiss, A. Goldenshluger), Functional regression (H.-G. MÃ¼ller, 2796 Oberwolfach Report 52/2004 T.Cai), Clustering (J. M. Buhmann, A. Nobel) among others. P. BÃ¼hlmann gave an overview on statistical methods of boosting while D. Yekutieli made an extended presentation on False Discovery Rate. There was one organized discussion on Smoothing methods in classification. The workshop gave an excellent opportunity for exchanging the opinions and expertise as well as for discussing various topics in different areas of modern mathematical statistics and machine learning theory. The discussion revealed a lot of common ideas and principles in these two fields but also differences in the methodology and approaches. An exchange of ideas can clearly contribute to the both fields. Already during workshop some new projects were originated that involve both statisticians and people from machine learning society. The workshop was attended by a number of young statisticians and gave an excellent opportunity for training: both by attending the high level presentation, by presenting their own results and by participating at the numerous informal discussions.

e187ea180e5993197b08b5978ab6981388c572b1,Combining adaptive designs with control of the false discovery rate--a generalized definition for a global p-value.,When combining adaptive designs with control of the False Discovery Rate one has to keep in mind that the most frequently used procedure for controlling the False Discovery Rate--the explorative Simes procedure--is a stepwise multiple testing procedure. At the interim analysis of an adaptive design it is however not yet known what the boundaries for rejection of hypotheses in the final analysis will be as these boundaries depend on the size of the final p-values. Therefore classical adaptive designs with a predefined stopping criterion for early rejection of hypotheses are not well suited. We propose a generalized definition of a global p-value for a two-stage adaptive design permitting a flexible decision for stopping at the interim analysis. By means of a simulation study in the field of genetic epidemiology we illustrate how applying such a two-stage design can reduce costs.,2007,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Anja Victor"", ids = ""145773124""); list(name = ""Gerhard Hommel"", ids = ""2195524"")",4daa0a95105a21de0490231ed102395ceff0a73e; b76ecf57c95524129701e19133c389711e46b77e; c0af0e87f110d7d8ef4cd7790eaef7364348013f; 7208a0c4ab5e65c1ffa168dca813fdba28378968; f70431e51a2d3d9dcd845f5eb61d34bc30895251; 7670bcaad6933d39d15a560ccdfab881edb14053; dd540ea55a1f39644fa8d269988e5876a0538c5f; c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f; 1d7413d90c53a5425b5edc79ceadfbe51082ac21; 1ca20a49a125b649c833975174f4e3f99ed0c76f; 4a3fdd481386f7f61481af8822254cb90ded0f66,,Biometrical journal.

ffe2bcbd4a41202aa6295764c4e24b025cae0369,Usage of Machine Learning for Intrusion Detection in a Network,"Increase in volume and intensity of network attacks, forcing the business systems to revamp their network security solutions in order to avoid huge financial losses. Intrusion Detection Systems are one of the most essential security solutions in order to ensure the security of any network. Considering huge volumes of network data and complex nature of intrusions, the performance optimization of Network Intrusion Detection System became an open problem that is gaining more and more attention from the researchers nowadays. The objective of this paper is to identify a machine learning algorithm that provides high accuracy and real-time system application. This paper evaluates the performance of 15 different machine learning algorithms using NSL-KDD dataset on the basis of false discovery rate, average accuracy, root mean squared error and model building time. Firstly, 5 machine learning algorithms out of 15 are chosen on the basis of maximum accuracy and minimum error in WEKA. Simulation of these machine learning algorithms is performed using 10-fold cross validation. Thereafter, the best machine learning algorithm is selected on the basis of maximum accuracy and minimum model building time so that it can be readily implemented in real-time Intrusion Detection Systems.

395336f1f0e611a79fe56f61ebac671ef48caa45,A Robust Estimation of the Proportion of True Null Hypotheses Based on a Beta Mixture Model,"Microarrays allow investigators to assess the expression of thousands of genes and identify those with differential levels across groups. Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) proposed an adaptive false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure that has the ability to control the overall type I error rate. However, their method requires information about the proportion of true null hypotheses (Ï€0), which is unknown and has to be estimated. In this study, we propose a robust method to estimate Ï€0 based on the beta mixture model developed by Allison et al. (2002) for the distribution of the p-values from the multiplicity testing. A Monte Carlo study shows that our method outperforms the original approach by Allison et al. (2002) when the gene expressions are correlated. We also compare the results with the estimation method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000). A case study is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Chun-Chao Wang"", ids = ""50096629""); list(name = ""Yu-Hsing Lin"", ids = ""49418029""); list(name = ""Yi-Ting Hwang"", ids = ""2223332"")",628f62241eb3b9b99cc424095f55ed15f98c5478,,,49,43-59

Integrating de novo and case-control variation with an enhanced Bayesian framework incorporating evolutionary constraint against mutation, we implicate 99 genes in ASD risk at a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.1. Of these 99 risk genes, 46 show higher frequencies of disruptive de novo variants in individuals ascertained for severe neurodevelopmental delay, while 50 show higher frequencies in individuals ascertained for ASD, and comparing ASD cases with disruptive mutations in the two groups shows differences in phenotypic presentation. Expressed early in brain development, most of the risk genes have roles in neuronal communication or regulation of gene expression, and 12 fall within recurrent copy number variant loci. In human cortex single-cell gene expression data, expression of the 99 risk genes is also enriched in both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages, implying that disruption of these genes alters the development of both neuron types. Together, these insights broaden our understanding of the neurobiology of ASD.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""F Kyle Satterstrom"", ids = ""4701054""); list(name = ""Jack A.

fc742890a3f39fd970369ff8bc45365a0193edb2,Stationarity testing in 2D image analysis,"Signal and image stationarity is the basic assumption for many methods of their analysis. However this assumption is not true in a lot of real cases. The paper is focused on local stationary testing using a small symmetric neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is split into two parts which should have the same statistical properties when the hypothesis of image stationarity is valid. We apply various testing approaches (two-sampled F-test, t-test, WMW, K-S) to obtain adequate p-values for given pixel, mask position, and test type. Finally, using battery of masks and tests, we obtain the series of p-values for every pixel. Applying False Discovery Rate (FDR) methodology, we localize all the pixels when any hypothesis falls. Resulting binary image is an alternative to traditional edge detection but with strong statistical background.",2019,Engineering; Computer Science,"list(name = ""JaromÃ­r Kukal"", ids = ""1902080""); list(name = ""Iva NachtigalovÃ¡"", ids = ""1394299505""); list(name = ""Zuzana Krbcova"", ids = ""35513342""); list(name = ""Jan SvihlÃ­k"", ids = ""2366562""); list(name = ""Karel Fliegel"", ids = ""2027230"")",,156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; ea4a4420210a4ae0e3acc77c42802a2bc3c2f6c9; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; cc204bca3a31ea65e1ead06d04f2a50abbce2b3f; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 1d75a25f46b3220ae254f8e500da76ad1eec10bf,,11137,111372G - 111372G-8
5ddb8fc8d0fba1ffa2ae657f04e6acd3ada8608e,The Homeobox Gene MEIS1 Is Methylated in BRAF p.V600E Mutated Colon Tumors,"Development of colorectal cancer (CRC) can occur both via gene mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, as well as via epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation. Site-specific methylation in CRC regulates expression of tumor-associated genes. Right-sided colon tumors more frequently have BRAF (p.V600E) mutations and have higher methylation grades when compared to left-sided malignancies. The aim of this study was to identify DNA methylation changes associated with BRAF (p.V600E) mutation status. We performed methylation profiling of colon tumor DNA, isolated from frozen sections enriched for epithelial cells by macro-dissection, and from paired healthy tissue. Single gene analyses comparing BRAF (p.V600E) with BRAF wild type revealed MEIS1 as the most significant differentially methylated gene (log2 fold change: 0.89, false discovery rate-adjusted P-value 2.8*10(-9)). This finding was validated by methylation-specific PCR that was concordant with the microarray data. Additionally, validation in an independent cohort (n=228) showed a significant association between BRAF (p.V600E) and MEIS1 methylation (OR: 13.0, 95% CI: 5.2 - 33.0, P<0.0001). MEIS1 methylation was associated with decreased MEIS1 gene expression in both patient samples and CRC cell lines. The same was true for gene expression of a truncated form of MEIS1, MEIS1 D27 , which misses exon 8 and has a proposed tumor suppression function. To trace the origin of MEIS1 promoter methylation, 14 colorectal tumors were flow-sorted. Four out of eight BRAF (p.V600E) tumor epithelial fractions (50%) showed MEIS1 promoter methylation, as well as three out of eight BRAF (p.V600E) stromal fractions (38%). Only one out of six BRAF wild type showed MEIS1 promoter methylation in both the epithelial tumor and stromal fractions (17%). In conclusion, BRAF (p.V600E) colon tumors showed significant MEIS1 promoter methylation, which was associated with decreased MEIS1 gene expression.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashwin A.

8ce856edc29d89fcb61d0495fe4f663dc6ec0387,Nutritional metabolomics and breast cancer risk in a prospective study.,"Background: The epidemiologic evidence for associations between dietary factors and breast cancer is weak and etiologic mechanisms are often unclear. Exploring the role of dietary biomarkers with metabolomics can potentially facilitate objective dietary characterization, mitigate errors related to self-reported diet, agnostically test metabolic pathways, and identify mechanistic mediators.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations of diet-related metabolites with the risk of breast cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.Design: We examined prediagnostic serum concentrations of diet-related metabolites in a nested case-control study in 621 postmenopausal invasive breast cancer cases and 621 matched controls in the multicenter PLCO cohort. We calculated partial Pearson correlations between 617 metabolites and 55 foods, food groups, and vitamin supplements on the basis of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and derived from a 137-item self-administered food-frequency questionnaire. Diet-related metabolites (P-correlation < 1.47 Ã— 10-6) were evaluated in breast cancer analyses. ORs for the 90th compared with the 10th percentile were calculated by using conditional logistic regression, with body mass index, physical inactivity, other breast cancer risk factors, and caloric intake controlled for (false discovery rate <0.2).Results: Of 113 diet-related metabolites, 3 were associated with overall breast cancer risk (621 cases): caprate (10:0), a saturated fatty acid (OR: 1.77; 95% CI = 1.28, 2.43); Î³-carboxyethyl hydrochroman (Î³-CEHC), a vitamin E (Î³-tocopherol) derivative (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.28); and 4-androsten-3Î²,17Î²-diol-monosulfate (1), an androgen (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.16). Nineteen metabolites were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER+) breast cancer (418 cases): 12 alcohol-associated metabolites, including 7 androgens and Î±-hydroxyisovalerate (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.50, 3.32); 3 vitamin E (tocopherol) derivatives (e.g., Î³-CEHC; OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70); butter-associated caprate (10:0) (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.67); and fried food-associated 2-hydroxyoctanoate (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.07). No metabolites were significantly associated with ER-negative breast cancer (144 cases).Conclusions: Prediagnostic serum concentrations of metabolites related to alcohol, vitamin E, and animal fats were moderately strongly associated with ER+ breast cancer risk. Our findings show how nutritional metabolomics might identify diet-related exposures that modulate cancer risk.

a615b032d1e2d82fba45df66bf88696efdf74562,Abstract P4-15-03: Proteomic modulation in breast tumors after metformin use: Results from a â€œwindow of opportunityâ€ trial,"Background: Laboratory and population studies demonstrate that metformin offers a beneficial breast cancer (BC) effect through reduction of serum insulin levels and changes in cellular protein synthesis and growth, such as AMPK pathway signaling. In a pre-surgical metformin trial of overweight/obese, multi-ethnic BC patients, we reported no difference in tumor proliferation, as measured by ki-67. However, reductions in other biomarkers were observed, including reduction in body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol, serum insulin, and leptin. Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) is a high-throughput antibody-based technique to assess cellular protein activity in signaling networks. The goal of this study was to assess changes in functional proteomics through RPPA in patients treated in a pre-surgical metformin trial.

Methods: Metformin 1500mg PO daily (500mg am/1000 mg pm) was administered for 2-4 weeks prior to resection in 35 patients with stage 0-III operable BC, BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2, and no history of diabetes. Protein was extracted from pre- and post-metformin paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, denatured by sodium dodecyl sulfate, and printed on nitrocellulose-coated slides. Samples were probed with 160 antibodies. Evaluated antibodies associated with various cellular activities, including PI3K/AKT signaling, HSP90 clients, Src/STAT activity, and apoptosis. We analyzed changes in RPPA parameters in tumor tissue of study patients with those of untreated historical controls, matched by age, BMI, and tumor characteristics. Paired t-test was used to calculate within-group changes in RPPA, and two-sample t-tests were used to compare between-group changes in cases and controls (significance: p â‰¤ 0.05). Multiple comparisons were adjusted for by fixing the false discovery rate (FDR) at 25%.

Results: Of the 35 metformin-treated patients, 32 were evaluable. The majority were Hispanic (80%). Metformin was administered for a median of 23 days (range: 8-64). Of the invasive BCs (n = 21/35), 80% of patients had HR+/HER2- BC. The 33 historical controls were well-matched. For RPPA, the mean total formalin-fixed paraffin embedded protein concentration was 38.9 ug (SD: 3.3). Of the 160 antibodies, 67 antibodies significantly changed after metformin use in the treated group, including reduction in pAKTS473, pAKTT308, and MTOR (unadjusted). Nineteen antibodies were identified as having between group differences in change from baseline: increase in BadpS112, C-RAF, Claudin-7, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, EGFR, HER3 pY1298, Lck, PKC-alphapS657, RAD50, Raptor, Syk, and TRFC; reduction in 14-3-3 epsilon, FOXO3a, JNKpT183, MAPKpT202, MEK1pS217, and SrcpY416. Adjusting for multiple comparisons, the following remain statistically significantly different between cases vs. controls: increase in BadpS112, C-RAF, Cyclin D1, and Raptor; and reduction in JNKpT183. Further assessment of RPPA modulation is ongoing, including changes grouped by signaling pathway and activity, as well as validation by immunohistochemistry.

Conclusions: Compared to controls, metformin use associates with changes in apoptosis, cell signaling, C-RAF, and Raptor. These results should be further validated in larger metformin intervention trials to better define populations who may benefit from this therapy.

55037fc3c950fcb47d64ed6ca61cc35083a4ec64,Multicohort Analysis of Whole-Blood Gene Expression Data Does Not Form a Robust Diagnostic for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Objectives: To identify a novel, generalizable diagnostic for acute respiratory distress syndrome using whole-blood gene expression arrays from multiple acute respiratory distress syndrome cohorts of varying etiologies. Data Sources: We performed a systematic search for human whole-blood gene expression arrays of acute respiratory distress syndrome in National Institutes of Health Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress. We also included the Glue Grant gene expression cohorts. Study Selection: We included investigator-defined acute respiratory distress syndrome within 48 hours of diagnosis and compared these with relevant critically ill controls. Data Extraction: We used multicohort analysis of gene expression to identify genes significantly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome, both with and without adjustment for clinical severity score. We performed gene ontology enrichment using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and cell type enrichment tests for both immune cells and pneumocyte gene expression. Finally, we selected a gene set optimized for diagnostic power across the datasets and used leave-one-dataset-out cross validation to assess robustness of the model. Data Synthesis: We identified datasets from three adult cohorts with sepsis, one pediatric cohort with acute respiratory failure, and two datasets of adult patients with trauma and burns, for a total of 148 acute respiratory distress syndrome cases and 268 critically ill controls. We identified 30 genes that were significantly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (false discovery rate < 20% and effect size >1.3), many of which had been previously associated with sepsis. When metaregression was used to adjust for clinical severity scores, none of these genes remained significant. Cell type enrichment was notable for bands and neutrophils, suggesting that the gene expression signature is one of acute inflammation rather than lung injury per se. Finally, an attempt to develop a generalizable diagnostic gene set for acute respiratory distress syndrome showed a mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of only 0.63 on leave-one-dataset-out cross validation. Conclusions: The whole-blood gene expression signature across a wide clinical spectrum of acute respiratory distress syndrome is likely confounded by systemic inflammation, limiting the utility of whole-blood gene expression studies for uncovering a generalizable diagnostic gene signature.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Timothy E.

2d67d94a0c83db3f31cf631317ca8722b4abb1fd,Tract shape modeling detects changes associated with preterm birth and neuroprotective treatment effects,"Preterm birth is associated with altered connectivity of neural circuits. We developed a tract segmentation method that provides measures of tract shape and integrity (probabilistic neighborhood tractography, PNT) from diffusion MRI (dMRI) data to test the hypotheses: 1) preterm birth is associated with alterations in tract topology (R), and tract-averaged mean diffusivity (ã€ˆDã€‰) and fractional anisotropy (FA); 2) neural systems are separable based on tract-averaged dMRI parameters; and 3) PNT can detect neuroprotective treatment effects. dMRI data were collected from 87 preterm infants (mean gestational age 29(+1) weeks, range 23(+2) -34(+6)) at term equivalent age and 24 controls (mean gestational age 39(+6) weeks). PNT was used to segment eight major fasciculi, characterize topology, and extract tract-averagedã€ˆDã€‰and FA. Tract topology was altered by preterm birth in all tracts except the splenium (p < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected). After adjustment for age at scan, tract-averagedã€ˆDã€‰was increased in the genu and splenium, right corticospinal tract (CST) and the left and right inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) in preterm infants compared with controls (p < 0.05, FDR), while tract-averaged FA was decreased in the splenium and left ILF (p < 0.05, FDR). Specific fasciculi were separable based on tract-averagedã€ˆDã€‰and FA values. There was a modest decrease in tract-averagedã€ˆDã€‰in the splenium of preterm infants who had been exposed to antenatal MgSO4 for neuroprotection (p = 0.002). Tract topology is a biomarker of preterm brain injury. The data provide proof of concept that tract-averaged dMRI parameters have utility for evaluating tissue effects of perinatal neuroprotective strategies.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Devasuda Anblagan"", ids = ""6393772""); list(name = ""Mark E.

In this study, 428 serum samples were collected from 107 pregnant women suffering from GDM and 107 matched healthy controls. The nontargeted metabolomics data of maternal serum samples from the first (T1, n = 214) and second trimesters (T2, n = 214) were acquired by using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 93 differential metabolites were identified on the basis of the accurate mass and MS/MS fragmentation. After false discovery rate correction, the levels of 31 metabolites in GDM group were significantly altered in the first trimester. The differential metabolites were mainly attributed to purine metabolism, fatty acid Î²-oxidation, urea cycle, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. The fold changes across pregnancy (T2/T1) of six amino acids (serine, proline, leucine/isoleucine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, and ornithine), a lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:4)), and uric acid in GDM group were significantly different from those in the control groups, suggesting that these 8 metabolites might have contributed to the occurrence and progression of GDM. The findings revealed that the amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and other pathways might be disturbed prior to GDM onset and during the period from the first to the second trimester of pregnancy.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hongzhi Zhao"", ids = ""16578637""); list(name = ""Han Li"", ids = ""49404749""); list(name = ""Arthur Chi Kong Chung"", ids = ""37844691""); list(name = ""Li Xiang"", ids = ""143807360""); list(name = ""Xiaona Li"", ids = ""13798914""); list(name = ""Yuanyuan Zheng"", ids = ""35058509""); list(name = ""Hemi Luan"", ids = ""50314304""); list(name = ""Lin Zhu"", ids = ""145857011""); list(name = ""Wenyu Liu"", ids = ""49663410""); list(name = ""Yang Peng"", ids = ""40336244""); list(name = ""Yaxing Zhao"", ids = ""47827705""); list(name = ""Shunqing Xu"", ids = ""47411697""); list(name = ""Yuanyuan Li"", ids = ""144590570""); list(name = ""Zongwei Cai"", ids = ""47058202"")",4e9148c3caa423b3c24bbf4f8f8ee3ce31d333ed,,Journal of proteome research,18 1,"

We recruited Asian breast cancer patients to perform a cohort study to uncover chemotherapy related cognitive disorder by using resting-state functioning magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) combined with neuropsychologic assessments. This is the first prospective study which combines RS-fMRI and DTI to detect chemotherapy related cognitive disorder. The neuropsychologic tests and MRI were performed before and after the chemotherapy. The healthy controls were tested at matched times. The chemotherapy-treated group performed worse on memory and we found significant changes in the cerebellum, right orbitofrontal area, right middle and superior temporal gyrus, right subcentral area, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and precentral gyrus in RS-fMRI after chemotherapy. We found changes in the fornix and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus with DTI. There was a correlation between some cognitive function and MRI measurements in the correlation analysis, but it was not significant after false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing corrections.

a6b596b62a145939f7172f7d3b59916ab9dc0af6,Global Methylation Analysis of Cyclin D1vs D2 Dysregulated Primary Myeloma Samples,"Multiple myeloma (MM) may be classified according to D-type cyclin dysregulation. Amongst nonhyperdiploid cases, those with IgH translocations t(4;14) or t(14;16) express high levels of cyclin D2, and those with t(11;14) express elevated cyclin D1. Although translocation-based subgroups may behave differently, cyclin D2 dysregulated disease tends to progress with more proliferative disease and poorer outcomes compared to cyclin D1. The importance of methylation status has been described in MM, with the transition from MGUS to symptomatic MM characterised by global hypomethylation, and gene-specific hypermethylation differences between cytogenetic subtypes.

To investigate the utility of methylation profiling between D1 and D2-dysregulated MM, we carried out a pilot study of global methylation changes between these groups. Primary bone marrow samples were collected from eight cyclin D1 patients with t(11;14), and eight D2 patients (four t(4;14) and four t(14;16)), and CD138+ cells purified by magnet-assisted selection. Following bisulfite conversion, samples were processed on llumina Infinium human methylation27 arrays. Methylation was classified with a beta score between 0 (unmethylated) and 1 (methylated). Initial analysis was performed using Illumina GenomeStudio, and subsequently with the Limma package in R. Differentially methylated probes were corrected for false discovery rate (FDR), with a threshold of 0.01 considered significant. Survival analyses were calculated from the date of sampling.

Unsupervised clustering split the samples into two groups (group 1 and group2), which did not match with D-cyclin status, but did show clear differences in clinical course. Survival analysis between groups 1 and 2 showed trends toward differences in median overall survival (61.7 vs 11.9 months, p=0.06) and progression free survival (24.4 vs 7.2 months, p=0.34). Although not significant at the p<0.05 threshold, the survival curves suggest a difference that may become clearer in a larger cohort. Analysis of the probes between these groups revealed 1379 methylation variable positions (MVPs) which were significantly different. Interestingly, almost all of these (1376/1379) were hypermethylated in the poorer outcome Group 2. This suggests a difference in methylation status between two prognostic groups which warrants further investigation.

We then went on to perform supervised clustering between the samples, splitting them into two groups (D1 and D2) based on their cyclin D status. This analysis did not reveal any MVPs even at a less stringent FDR-adjusted threshold of 0.05. However, we did observe that of the top 20 differentially methylated probes three were for the CCND1 gene, which in all cases showed relative hypomethylation in the cyclin D1 dysregulated samples. Other genes of potential interest with relative hypomethylation in the cyclin D1 group were DAB2 which has previously been reported to be hypermethylated in the t(4;14) OPM2 cell line, and AK3L1 â€“ a kinase which interestingly, has been reported as showing vulnerability to targeted RNAi inhibition in two cyclin D2 dysregulated cell lines (KMS11 and JJN3).

In this small cohort, although cyclin D1 vs cyclin D2 classification does not appear to be sufficient to define distinct methylation profiles, a group of genes with hypermethylation appears to be associated with poorer prognosis. The hypomethylation of CCND1 in cyclin D1 dyregulated samples, although below the significance threshold in this dataset, is consistent with previously described findings of CCND1 hypomethylation in t(11;14) cell lines, but our results in the D2 MM samples differ from previous reports of hypomethylation in all nonhyperdiploid primary samples. We intend to investigate this further and extend this analysis by prospective sampling and methylation analysis on a larger cohort of patients treated on a standard protocol.

We studied C57Bl/6J Bhmt (betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase)-null mice at age 4, 12, 24, and 52 wk (N = 8) and observed elevation of S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations and development of preneoplastic foci in the liver (increased placental glutathione S-transferase and cytokeratin 8-18 activity; starting at 12 wk). At 4 wk, we identified 63 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs; false discovery rate < 5%) proximal to 81 genes (across 14 chromosomes), of which 18 were differentially expressed. Of these DMCs, 52% were located in one 15.5-Mb locus on chromosome 13, which encompassed the Bhmt gene and defined a potentially sensitive region with mostly decreased methylation. Analyzing Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel data, which consisted of 100 inbred strains of mice, we identified 97 DMCs that were affected by Bhmt genetic variation in the same region, with 7 overlapping those found in Bhmt-null mice (P < 0.001). At all time points, we found a hypomethylated region mapping to Iqgap2 (IQ motif-containing GTPase activating protein 2) and F2rl2 (proteinase-activated receptor-3), 2 genes that were also silenced and underexpressed, respectively.-Lupu, D.

dc4801e063050570abb4bee2dd13faaae646f765,Genetic Evidence For Psychiatric Disorders As The Extreme End of A Continuum of Population Traits,"Abstract Psychiatric disorders are highly heritable and polygenic, with numerous common genetic risk variants implicated. Twin and molecular genetic studies suggest that some clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorders (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) share genetic risk with quantitative variation in milder traits of the same disorder throughout the general population. We utilized the latest emerging results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 8 psychiatric disorders to test for genetic overlap across each of these clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorders and related continuously distributed population traits. GWAS summary statistics for 8 psychiatric phenotypes were used to derive polygenic risk scores (PRS) in a Swedish population of twins (N=13,472 individuals) with data available at ages 9, 12, 15 and 18 years (Child & Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden). We tested for association between PRS for a given psychiatric disorder with traits related to the same disorder, assessed using parent- and self-report questionnaires. After applying a false discovery rate to account for multiple testing, the results showed support for a significant association between PRS for psychiatric disorder with corresponding childhood population traits for the following phenotypes: ADHD (beta(SE)=0.278(0.0295), p=6.8E-20), ASD (beta(SE)=0.0366(0.0137), p=0.019), tic disorders (beta(SE)=0.0126(0.00387), p=0.0063), depression (beta(SE)=0.273(0.105), p=0.021), anxiety disorders (beta(SE)=0.202(0.0795), p=0.023), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(OCD; beta(SE)=0.122(0.0447), p=0.019) and schizophrenia (beta(SE)=0.0561(0.0208), p=0.019). No association was seen for bipolar disorder PRS and adolescent mania symptoms. Results persisted after excluding individuals with relevant ICD diagnoses from analyses.

Alterations in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the development and progression of colon cancer, which arises from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in the colon tissue. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), new depths can be reached, allowing for comprehensive profiling of known and novel miRNAs. To profile the miRNAs and their associated target genes in colon cancer, we examined differential expression of miRNAs and predicted target genes between tumor and normal tissue of microsatellite stable (MSS) and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-negative colon cancer. Ten fresh-frozen colon tumors and 10 adjacent normal mucosa were profiled for miRNAs using the SOLiD NGS platform and mRNA expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix arrays. To identify differentially expressed miRNAs in tumor versus normal tissue, analysis of variance was conducted that included Bonferroni correction. Integrated expression analysis of miRNAs and their target mRNAs was conducted using Pearson's correlation and the Benjamini and Hochberg's false discovery rate. Both analyses were done using Partek Genomics Suite software.

Nineteen miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in tumor versus normal tissue (fold change â‰¥ Â±2 and p<0.05). Six of these 19 miRNAs have previously been associated with colon cancer (miR-30a, miR-31, miR-135b, miR-182, miR-183 and miR-202).

Integrated analysis of miRNA and predicted target mRNA expression yielded 97 significantly correlated miRNA::mRNA pairs for 14 miRNAs with 92 genes (absolute r = 0.71â€“0.88, q<0.05). Within these miRNA::mRNA pairs, expression levels of the 6 colon cancer-associated miRNAs were correlated with 33 target genes and 8 miRNAs newly identified to be differentially expressed in colon cancer were correlated with 57 target genes. The top functional Ingenuity Pathway Analysis gene ontology categories (p<0.05) for the 92 genes were gastrointestinal disease (18 genes), genetic disorder (21genes), inflammatory disease (15 genes) and cancer (21 genes). The correlated target genes included several genes implicated in colon cancer such as CDH3, NKD1, RGS2, TCFL5 and ZEB2. In summary, deep miRNA sequencing among MSS/CIMP-negative colon tumors confirmed differential expression of 6 colon cancer-associated miRNAs and identified 13 miRNAs not previously reported in colon cancer. Differential expression of most of the discovered miRNAs was correlated with the expression of genes potentially relevant for colon cancer. If confirmed, these miRNAs may serve as new biomarkers for colon cancer and may further our understanding of the epigenetic changes and pathways involved in the development of colon cancer.

Our approach uses a multiple hypothesis test based on log-likelihood ratios. This multiple test detects the number of propagation paths in a multipath channel iteratively. To control the global level of the multiple test, we apply the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. The power of this multiple test has been investigated through narrowand broadband simulations in previous studies. We apply the multiple hypothesis test to real MIMO antenna array measurements. MIMO measurement data were recorded with the RUSK-ATM vector channel sounder. The sounder operated at a center frequency of 2000 MHz with an output power of 2 W and a transmitted signal bandwidth of 120 MHz. Maximum-likelihood estimates for direction of arrival are obtained for all model orders p = 0, 1, . . . , Pmax.

Thirty-two premenopausal women aged (meanÂ Â±Â SD) 47.75Â Â±Â 1.55Â years and twenty-five recently perimenopausal women aged 51.60Â Â±Â 1.63Â years were evaluated for sex hormone levels, including prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, oestradiol, free testosterone and progesterone. A 3.0-Tesla MRI scanner was utilised to acquire T1 images. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate changes in grey matter volume between the two groups. The general linear model was applied with false discovery rate correction for between group voxel-wise statistics. Spearman partial correlation analyses were conducted between age, sex hormone levels and regions of grey matter volume showing significant differences between the two groups. The VBM analysis revealed that age and menopause per se lead to grey matter volume reduction in certain brain structures.

bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643,A knockoff filter for high-dimensional selective inference,"This paper develops a framework for testing for associations in a possibly high-dimensional linear model where the number of features/variables may far exceed the number of observational units. In this framework, the observations are split into two groups, where the first group is used to screen for a set of potentially relevant variables, whereas the second is used for inference over this reduced set of variables; we also develop strategies for leveraging information from the first part of the data at the inference step for greater power. In our work, the inferential step is carried out by applying the recently introduced knockoff filter, which creates a knockoff copy-a fake variable serving as a control-for each screened variable. We prove that this procedure controls the directional false discovery rate (FDR) in the reduced model controlling for all screened variables; this says that our high-dimensional knockoff procedure 'discovers' important variables as well as the directions (signs) of their effects, in such a way that the expected proportion of wrongly chosen signs is below the user-specified level (thereby controlling a notion of Type S error averaged over the selected set). This result is non-asymptotic, and holds for any distribution of the original features and any values of the unknown regression coefficients, so that inference is not calibrated under hypothesized values of the effect sizes. We demonstrate the performance of our general and flexible approach through numerical studies. Finally, we apply our method to a genome-wide association study to find locations on the genome that are possibly associated with a continuous phenotype.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rina Foygel Barber"", ids = ""32492090""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

2757e4a4000a1f740265cfe45b23545d0e216088,Childhood adversity and subsequent mental health status in adulthood: screening for associations using two linked surveys.,"AIMS
Accumulating evidence links childhood adversity to negative health outcomes in adulthood. However, most of the available evidence is retrospective and subject to recall bias. Published reports have sometimes focused on specific childhood exposures (e.g. abuse) and/or specific outcomes (e.g. major depression). Other studies have linked childhood adversity to a large and diverse number of adult risk factors and health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. To advance this literature, we undertook a broad examination of data from two linked surveys. The goal was to avoid retrospective distortion and to provide a descriptive overview of patterns of association.


METHODS
A baseline interview for the Canadian National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth collected information about childhood adversities affecting children aged 0-11 in 1994. The sampling procedures employed in a subsequent study called the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) made it possible to link n =Â 1977 of these respondents to follow-up data collected later when respondents were between the ages of 14 and 27. Outcomes included major depressive episodes (MDE), some risk factors and educational attainment. Cross-tabulations were used to examine these associations and adjusted estimates were made using the regression models. As the NPHS was a longitudinal study with multiple interviews, for most analyses generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used. As there were multiple exposures and outcomes, a statistical procedure to control the false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg) was employed.


RESULTS
Childhood adversities were consistently associated with a cluster of potentially related outcomes: MDE, psychotropic medication use and smoking. These outcomes may be related to one another since psychotropic medications are used in the treatment of major depression, and smoking is strongly associated with major depression. However, no consistent associations were observed for other outcomes examined: physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, binge drinking or educational attainment.


CONCLUSIONS
The conditions found to be the most strongly associated with childhood adversities were a cluster of outcomes that potentially share pathophysiological connections. Although prior literature has suggested that a very large number of adult outcomes, including physical inactivity and alcohol-related outcomes follow childhood adversity, this analysis suggests a degree of specificity with outcomes potentially related to depression. Some of the other reported adverse outcomes (e.g. those related to alcohol use, physical inactivity or more distal outcomes such as obesity and cardiovascular disease) may emerge later in life and in some cases may be secondary to depression, psychotropic medication use and smoking.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Scott B.

04b1e3f6564f069c7ad42d73a2df045da7b5bc45,Thousands of cis-regulatory sequence combinations are shared by Arabidopsis and poplar.,"The identification of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) can greatly advance our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms. Despite the existence of binding sites of more than three transcription factors (TFs) in a CRM, studies in plants often consider only the cooccurrence of binding sites of one or two TFs. In addition, CRM studies in plants are limited to combinations of only a few families of TFs. It is thus not clear how widespread plant TFs work together, which TFs work together to regulate plant genes, and how the combinations of these TFs are shared by different plants. To fill these gaps, we applied a frequent pattern-mining-based approach to identify frequently used cis-regulatory sequence combinations in the promoter sequences of two plant species, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). A cis-regulatory sequence here corresponds to a DNA motif bound by a TF. We identified 18,638 combinations composed of two to six cis-regulatory sequences that are shared by the two plant species. In addition, with known cis-regulatory sequence combinations, gene function annotation, gene expression data, and known functional gene sets, we showed that the functionality of at least 96.8% and 65.2% of these shared combinations in Arabidopsis are partially supported, under a false discovery rate of 0.1 and 0.05, respectively. Finally, we discovered that 796 of the 18,638 combinations might relate to functions that are important in bioenergy research. Our work will facilitate the study of gene transcriptional regulation in plants.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jun Ding"", ids = ""145137207""); list(name = ""Haiyan Hu"", ids = ""145431913""); list(name = ""Xiaoman Li"", ids = ""50080279"")",05547de23ce5b3c3fdf88bacadea40eca18e4939; c16e30238433deb072fe50de8bdb6ead2b4ebaa1; e10882c70769b95555c12a2c1f1dac755e74f583; fa55c6cfbec0d00452f1564d2f9ea096c270d0ba; 5eef4aa8fa4bfe502e18e4359b86f5b5a4a55d27; c85019b55bf776119c0b674c92b2af4eea59b9ac; 5b280291798299ba25a8195de1827ec60c19a42d; e34dacd486346fb9e6496ee33acd3c87d3762574; e6132428467fd9c74b992355be666c96337f5550; 517dfc9f3050c430ea82ed8f920f503187ffdc55; e534fb6b5ba40de98b585da265d26c39e450053c; c965429eff06648cc5799e019d443684ac28ab0a; efd44e96a22398f7e0bb1993f9677584ea2a6864; c8b29b00371bddb461b10a08294455f0834bd727; e15c24baacfce700b32700c4a7e3d63e82d2dbcc; 5250c26d0357c59920d0a6046a4be1dbabc11975; 91791ea3583f5427988375758abfbadf974f9ca0; b12d3ac9491522ad2b22116897543e933f747806,,Plant physiology,158 1,"

1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f,Dynamic adaptive multiple tests with finite sample FDR control,"The present paper introduces new adaptive multiple tests which rely on the estimation of the number of true null hypotheses and which control the false discovery rate (FDR) at level alpha for finite sample size. We derive exact formulas for the FDR for a large class of adaptive multiple tests which apply to a new class of testing procedures. In the following, generalized Storey estimators and weighted versions are introduced and it turns out that the corresponding adaptive step up and step down tests control the FDR. The present results also include particular dynamic adaptive step wise tests which use a data dependent weighting of the new generalized Storey estimators. In addition, a converse of the Benjamini Hochberg (1995) theorem is given. The Benjamini Hochberg (1995) test is the only ""distribution free"" step up test with FDR independent of the distribution of the p-values of false null hypotheses.",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Philipp Heesen"", ids = ""90478520""); list(name = ""Arnold Janssen"", ids = ""34626641"")",aa95eaffacddcc1cde626b25be7739346873a1f6; a3dfc5ae1aea7add5a8ee2d42b27dacd9ad41d31; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 8e835bd75f760f7b0138ce9c73bece4ed69b6f28; 668288567719a7d837cf367ef86fc015aa03f945; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; 85b3043be9fa0b7afe0e72694a23df8dfcbcb0a1; a242ba57781391f9de61b9bb313b2507d98e2e64; b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930,21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; e91ae2cef456516df3d9fc6997428500a1b8b5d3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; e1218ceea3e1a253a212431d81d10419c798cf3c; 0725893c81e1ea0131e27ffab61c31900f9bef05; 5f2c2a9e17b0b4f9b77cfdf9b29662f572e2442e; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; cb9f6f5fae553d372dbcefecb2535b8caca9d0c5; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 1d5996f89ca5b84a53e655b35df10636aa12805a,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,38-51
11310c51b2f4fdb10f511ad38a4d6ad8c439ea5a,1H NMR Metabolomics Identifies Underlying Inflammatory Pathology in Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Joints,"Despite osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) being typically age-related, their underlying etiologies are markedly different. We used 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify differences in metabolite profiles in low volumes of OA and RA synovial fluid (SF). SF was aspirated from knee joints of 10 OA and 14 RA patients. 100 Î¼L SF was analyzed using a 700 MHz Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were analyzed by Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Metaboanalyst. 50 metabolites were annotated, including amino acids, saccharides, nucleotides and soluble lipids. Discriminant analysis identified group separation between OA and RA cohorts, with 32 metabolites significantly different between OA and RA SF (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Metabolites of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were lower in RA compared to OA; these results concur with higher levels of inflammation, synovial proliferation and hypoxia found in RA compared to OA. Elevated taurine in OA may indicate increased subchondral bone sclerosis. We demonstrate that quantifiable differences in metabolite abundance can be measured in low volumes of SF by 1H NMR spectroscopy, which may be clinically useful to aid diagnosis and improve understanding of disease pathogenesis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""James R Anderson"", ids = ""152737250""); list(name = ""Susama Chokesuwattanaskul"", ids = ""41067763""); list(name = ""Marie M.

93cdeb55cd8b24098d96a2b1052b204820e98d20,Detection of Differentially Expressed Genes via Mixture Models and Cluster Analysis,"The advent of new technologies in fields such as genomics and proteonomics has seen an exponential increase in biological data. Until recently, statisticians have considered, in practice and theory, problems where the number of replications, n, is large relative to the `unknowns'. As such, classical methods rely on some implicit understanding that there must be, at least in theory, many observations per parameter. Fisher-Neyman-Pearson theory of hypothesis testing, for example, was mathematically elegant and widely applicable. However, control of the family wise error rate (FWER) in multiple hypothesis testing is no longer a feasible approach. In this thesis, we consider the multiple hypothesis testing problem. We suppose that there is a large number N of hypotheses to be tested simultaneously. It is considered in the context of the problem of the detection of differentially expressed genes on the basis of data arising from a series of n microarray experiments that provide measurements (gene expression data) on a very large number N of genes. Throughout this thesis we will investigate the application of the two-component normal mixture model to the distribution of transformed test statistics, the resulting FDR, and the posterior probability of differential expression. Furthermore, we will respond to the problems caused by excessive correlation in microarrays, and develop a clustering method where by the initial aim is to cluster the gene profiles into a number of tight clusters in order to share information about the genes. We use a mixture of linear models to effect this clustering from which we are able to assess the probability of no differential expression for each gene and the local false discovery rate. We demonstrate this approach on simulated and real data sets and compare our methods and results to others in the field.",2011,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Leesa F Wockner"", ids = ""3532536"")",,,,,
bf0b6b4fcb2214c7964710d1eb6d54de339da6ce,Gene Expression Analysis of So Called Asian Dust Extracts in Human Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells,"As the frequency and the intensity of so called Asian dust (AD) events have increased, public concerns about the adverse health effects has spiked sharply over the last two decades. Despite the recent reports on the correlation between AD events and the risk for cardiovascular and respiratory disease, the nature of the toxicity and the degree of the risk are yet largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the dichloromethane extract of AD (AD-X) and that of urban dust (NAD-X) collected during a non-AD period on gene expression in HL-60 cells using Illumina Sentrix HumanRef-8 Expression BeadChips. Global changes in gene expression were analyzed after 24 h of incubation with 50 or 100 Î¼g/ml AD-X and NAD-X. By one-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction for false discovery rate of the results, 573 and 297 genes were identified as AD-X- and NAD-X-responsive, respectively. The genes were classified into three groups by Venn diagram analysis of their expression profile, i.e., 290 AD-X-specific, 14 NAD-X-specific, and 283 overlapping genes. Quantitative realtime PCR confirmed the changes in the expression levels of the selected genes. The expression patterns of five genes, namely SORL1, RABEPK, DDIT4, AZU1, and NUDT1 differed significantly between the two groups. Following rigorous validation process, these genes may provide information in developing biomarker for AD exposure.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""You-Jin Choi"", ids = ""90802320""); list(name = ""Hu-Quan Yin"", ids = ""121871012""); list(name = ""Eun-Jung Park"", ids = ""145763052""); list(name = ""Kwangsik Park"", ids = ""34686747""); list(name = ""Duck Soo Kim"", ids = ""4000238""); list(name = ""Byung-hoon Lee"", ids = ""3441579"")",f5430cd6b9228bac04055cef99b66df98a17edbc; 60e35013b7ef2609e142b43783422e25efe7ffc9,cce5fe3c032b41ad865f94813f04aaa7981220be; e894d84b946e6ef1a7569ea60fa02bf1bf73553f; 79d68f3b77216e1e55ab6dfd9f8b03f8b504bf69; d807025030763bf86ee1c880e064c931ab993d44; 327fcb397b1b83fa3fa675e1f9118515adeef396; b8ead1b980a359cc5b269d7c7ba1a2ad96f9a2c9; e647571d428416fc12a403bf8038f99889d5a817; 4f41045f310eff4a7b67e2c1e33be616ed523b96; 38464d5d9ec35036add9acd228d2c8e73a874d7b; 49fe53ad6d95952e8db0d7538fe9a65347c65d5e; 8d68be18687a6fe728d7419a257cf480fc30fb59; c6493aff253a59c1f87ffbe9fb5b4b37f47228fa; 638063d25580b2136f2a7f5ea90e1ef8cd1c08a9; a12bf0daffd8a4c5483d46bd9e0a1f6acc71d989; c80b5a0c0bd02da5394043fcbe80eb7d1e72af4b; 3393bd92f6cce9b5cbf7778267cf5ab66791b83e; f97b39d1dca8313df46dff0fb399751dc11b1369; ee94567e4e8aa1f8e94cee6bc2074c1407a1d267; 406a9d06bd7112cf091c24c43bff7a5a5a4205d4; 1e11498e054e045fbdcf50fdbcb7edddca9f338a; 986734b25497e0f55771a71947df291e04666a1a; 94b0da5ecd27b3499cfac18fc87fff0d6849bfeb; b8ee57cc330400983ab7e369141f15afe8dcc4f9; 43792989fbd22900f871de22c1f72ea441c18adf; 72d541df90a5fe5d3ea108ca61980ff01c1ced76,Toxicological Research,26,21 - 28

Instead, most or even all genes are invited into differential calls no matter they have real contributions to data variations or not. Thus, it would inevitably affect the robustness of D.E. analysis and lead to the increase of false positive ratios. In this study, we presented a novel feature selection method: nonnegative singular value approximation (NSVA) to enhance RNA-seq differential expression analysis by taking advantage of RNA-seq count dataâ€™s non-negativity. As a variance-based feature selection method, it selects genes according to its contribution to the first singular value direction of input data in a data-driven approach. It demonstrates robustness to depth bias and gene length bias in feature selection in comparison with its five peer methods. Combining with state-of-the-art RNA-seq differential expression analysis, it contributes to enhancing differential expression analysis by lowering false discovery rates caused by the biases. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection by proposing a data-driven differential expression analysis: NSVA-seq, besides conducting network marker discovery.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Henry Han"", ids = ""143905093"")",,767effb875305edeef89a8b7032ce5f5be0987f4; c73999e57a8361705cb384d675e85ef68bbbac84; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 5b8a1f931ef13f71345d0c8c4c43b1d25a390429; 61e175a86e9382417dd8490788001b42e91a7e1f; 6379ada4b0db8b1fd1305d2f59c073c1c109a17f; ec3d71a2fdd01968a6dc638ee261715a0f118c1e; 1b0acef89bd74cee4b05d163b363fcc8a02117a7; 9c58ccd5a93605e0139a393ac1b11b9568e1459c; 72b40d1dcce52fe72462373c105c6f06e601f00e; 62f8a69c7e3809949dd023852e0e0a54c49eaf74; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; 7155d2ff9b2d0daaf58847ae3985f23583425c87; 87ccc438b0c73fcfdea48485fcdb091a8ecaa89c; 35f03921a48e03687333b9d275bf5e58bd2520b8; 616abc4d558a2079e3c9ae354a07a1ce7d58fb6f; 5d5aa0063223a181239885b0b95171531df55933; 0059dab998f4e1bb35c1ff609e90533aae104b24; c42192af3f3f81770b85b7f14170fb2abcce17d7; 0d99e46805534750f248b9d73998c534d12e1b96; 2cd8dc8fe9e89af280eef7e5b00cecd73e564da9; 10d6778bc45aebcd58d336b4062b935861d2fe8a; 2bbb05640a79fb9704fb62289eb2de81ee154b7e; 5ea180ec9eaba7722cef434a2391fe73b7d342ea; d67a93295497578e114125a2e5e1041a1ec91fb4; 36e00caa724a4f8865b6f675fa27f7297e51ba41; ebe875cf08dd398e0ed25f518502301c984a9afe; ebae8e4e3eade34865379fc3da2e9517d3ff194c; 29bae9472203546847ec1352a604566d0f602728; 176d8d284938d109f3f375a025e9e9173b6ce53d; 1d20e0b3b8f4ffc61504a5ea6463216f4553251e; 6af11e57c9229789f175b712fb1d0ece374226b3; 94559c249d204110296c39ed4af2042cc4468e68; 7b45b22e8162e36ef0a21213b5391feac6f939fb; 3572a1d415a35d7fa8a4508811dd7b7fe63a0f69; 2a447a74756b89e100b83369cf6066bdc71a471e; 1cd0b645f442a65d4a4d6f9e22f198951f97991b; b695cb5a9718ca530aba8b2a2174657d4996d4e8; 55e7eecbf885ddc8546fc6e47755641d9d721f2b; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f36288c6fcc9a6542738135712838dab61c720a2; 0ade119b08626bcd0053b4608d71c07fd1a35d66; b4da5cc2676b86904a898490fc1c0a86906983d8,bioRxiv,,

To elucidate roles of miRNA in bovine muscle type specifi cation and maintenance, we sought to determine differentially expressed miRNA between semitendinosus (STD) and masseter (MS) muscles from 3 Japanese black cattle by massively parallel sequencing. Differential gene expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms confi rmed that STD and MS were MyHC-2xand MyHC-1-abundant muscles, respectively. In total, 192 known miRNA and 20 potential new bovine miRNA were obtained from the sequencing. The differentially expressed miRNA with more than 2-fold difference in each muscle were identifi ed. In particular, miR-196a and miR-885 were exclusively expressed in STD muscle, which was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (P = 0.045 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas a slow type-directing miR-208b was highly expressed in MS compared with STD (false discovery rate <0.05). In addition, 16 potential novel miRNA were mapped and confi rmed for their precursor structures by computational analyses. The results of functional annotation combined with in silico target analysis showed that the predicted target genes of miR-196a/b and miR-885 enriched gene ontology (GO) terms related to skeletal system development and regulation of transcription, respectively. Moreover, GO terms enriched from predicted targets miRNA suggested that STD-abundantand MS-abundant-miRNA were associated with embryonic body planning and organ/ tissue pattern formation, respectively. The present results revealed that the differentially expressed miRNA between the STD and MS muscles may play key roles to determine muscle type-specifi c tissue formation and maintenance in cattle thorough attenuating putative target genes involved in different developmental events.",2013,,"list(name = ""Susumu Muroya"", ids = ""4318412""); list(name = ""Misako Taniguchi"", ids = ""49209865""); list(name = ""Miho Shibata"", ids = ""47714811""); list(name = ""Mika Oe"", ids = ""40106692""); list(name = ""Koichi Ojima"", ids = ""20773517""); list(name = ""Ikuyo Nakajima"", ids = ""39594235""); list(name = ""Koichi Chikuni"", ids = ""5195864"")",fc4988e913cada6a1c5c51e34a1ad13c8ec83a89,2a1a3e911e193569bb3ff8d431aeaed8e8d827fd; 5e438bf5ccd6358e9c6bf2ceb743073631579f03; da28288fce5ae859936498f302ec2ff25fc6b230; 4d56229f1471dbacc77ae5c7e83d66405bbf89b1; 4f1dd8f50b15bf6096812ea004cde11cf3ace4c5; 3b3d4707bd2d443b2eb4e943c3376ea14a854eb6; 265bd84e6ca5da045c38d37971911f0f2b29a85c; f5ce4a91705b1aa5a671348eca0a3b5e675d6ed0; cf373b74c363b7ac805d317f747645334c03f9c8; 751fbe44158f9d590a06e2aa67179a94bff4ddd2; 7c43f53fe8494437713d8fd312610af7c7d7a6cf; 6eeda742c5f99d9a24dcc88fb7b1528e00fb351e; 346cc98fadd630c076756546fa11124768113067; 917eab1f89d3249c561a6fe57c47a03fb2237597; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 27f611f770980bbf2cf4699e4baf042b06a791f5; 2b2e5c16bdd5856275079945ac455e4e39803798; 36433aee09a5074af8759eb99156ba11ef78f055; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 929d28619e7878c3922438e625c8cff2e0fd91b1; 2a0a7322418a7a1a99df7a55907ea23911e1ae19; 2d1f978fd7046fb2787d13ed7b23fbcdd2a158a6; f881c390af6b8ef505e55cecbec97745892fba50; 8e5ec37476b5dd286a79fdf5205e73c1c2dbbbbb; 37ce1e137738c7c879599b56c72bbbcfdb66ff2e; db34e6964b23bdbc0579e67d01f4d744c8bb20e5; 03d298f8231ed2b6548ff774803ab84e71edea88; e16ed94c68088c8059120cb1282dc5610435e9a7; 29fcf89da4375a1c1e31b443dc65cafefb2757d5; bcaa30f8bd7cd05189a04b524ec836d0c3979929; 505b854b8acea06b8eacb1d46fbebeca196982c0; 9d04b20797f780ff2be1cf721d6b8eef8f7e18be; 19b8db4247fdb425597037cd96505da86ba126f0; 0d89ae12c32200b849675dae003acac85b167dd3; 0323cb10459adbb6057af7173f4abc1d61f24300; e9404b8c000193e113119116e57a41a97d805464; 59bde7b3624469ed5913f6026b9c1a81985fe81d; 117675f2715e791fb300216848484bb3801ea7bd; 8ba22032d12572b64afce50815daa9aa59b3ae38; cef2ae3f37b0ffd17f2e1b0363808e5b8739d141; e0f214e7ec8d76efb4e2cfb14fed0c67ab1da543; b44c542f588b53dabe4d4def6eabe819efab52c0; 626d07a9130e38e022ddc1084ac5544265b892d3; 4476b44a22156a6ab4a4c659cacc5859b70901e0,,,
b10998f2fa90357f16fc9ed0569ddd4c0218f505,Iconicity of simple Chinese characters,"The iconicity of a Chinese character, or the degree to which it looks like the concept that it represents, has been suggested as affecting the learning and processing of the character. However, previous studies have not provided good empirical information on the iconicity of specific characters. To fill this gap, 40 U.S. adults with no knowledge of Chinese were given an English word or short phrase together with two Chinese characters and were asked which character matched the meaning of the English word. The right and wrong answers had the same number of strokes, and different wrong answers were used for different participants. We examined all 213 simple-structure Chinese characters that occur in textbooks for elementary school children. The overall percentage of correct responses was 53.6%, slightly but significantly higher than would be expected by chance. Using a false discovery rate procedure, we found that 15 of the 213 characters were guessed at a level higher than chance. The proportion of correct responses to each character, which can be taken as an indicator of its degree of iconicity, should be useful to researchers studying Chinese character reading and writing.

The authors used a murine ankylosing enthesitis mouse model (DBA/1) to search for disease-associated genes and limb bud pellet culture to examine differences in cartilage and bone formation between DBA/1 and BALB/c mice. Materials and methods Male DBA/1 were crossed with female BALB/c mice. At 26 weeks, histomorphology was examined in male F2 mice from different litters. 159 markers with sequence-length polymorphisms on the autosomes were selected, with a median marker spacing of 6.9 cM. 162 F2 male mice were studied. Genes in regions of interests were linked to skeletal development pathways with the Gene Ontology database. Association was evaluated by Ï‡2 tests with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) algorithm. Limb bud pellet cultures were prepared from mesenchymal cells isolated from the forelimbs of 11.5 dpc BALB/c and DBA/1 embryos. High-density pellets were cultured in DMEM-F12 or GDF5 for 7 days. RNA was extracted and chondrogenic and osteogenic markers were assessed by qPCR. Results Incidence of ankylosing enthesitis was lower in the F2 generation as compared to wild-type DBA/1 males (42% vs 72%; p D3MIT199 and D3MIT160 were significant (p D3MIT42 and D3MIT129 , 162 genes were found among which Bmpr1b, Cxxc4, Lef1, Papss1, Pitx2 , and Ube2d3 . Only BMP receptor type 1b ( Bmpr1b ) was specifically upregulated in mice with spontaneous arthritis as demonstrated by qPCR. Additionally, Bmpr1b ligand, GDF5, induces differential expression of osteogenic genes in cultures from BALB/c mice as compared to DBA/1 mice. Osterix (OSX), osteocalcin (OC) and bone siaoloprotein (BSP) are all significantly upregulated in BALB/c cultures after 5 days in the presence of GDF5. Conclusions Using F2 mouse genetics in the analysis of joint ankylosis, The authors identified a locus on chromosome 3 that shows association to disease. Within this locus several genes may play a role in ankylosis, however, our functional data suggests that Bmpr1b is involved. The response to GDF5 in limb bud cultures highlights that differences exist in the GDF5-Bmpr1b pathway in BALB/c and disease-susceptible DBA/1 mice, further corroborating an essential role for BMPs in human and murine ankylosis.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Shea Carter"", ids = ""11953757""); list(name = ""Inge Derese"", ids = ""4688346""); list(name = ""Kirsten Braem"", ids = ""5953442""); list(name = ""Ana M.

f197cde2ebca64dfdb3b6e13ff0b71200de755af,Comparison of methods for identifying differentially expressed genes across multiple conditions from microarray data,"Identification of genes differentially expressed across multiple conditions has become an important statistical problem in analyzing large-scale microarray data. Many statistical methods have been developed to address the challenging problem. Therefore, an extensive comparison among these statistical methods is extremely important for experimental scientists to choose a valid method for their data analysis. In this study, we conducted simulation studies to compare six statistical methods: the Bonferroni (B-) procedure, the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH-) procedure, the Local false discovery rate (Localfdr) method, the Optimal Discovery Procedure (ODP), the Ranking Analysis of F-statistics (RAF), and the Significant Analysis of Microarray data (SAM) in identifying differentially expressed genes. We demonstrated that the strength of treatment effect, the sample size, proportion of differentially expressed genes and variance of gene expression will significantly affect the performance of different methods. The simulated results show that ODP exhibits an extremely high power in indentifying differentially expressed genes, but significantly underestimates the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in all different data scenarios. The SAM has poor performance when the sample size is small, but is among the best-performing methods when the sample size is large. The B-procedure is stringent and thus has a low power in all data scenarios. Localfdr and RAF show comparable statistical behaviors with the BH-procedure with favorable power and conservativeness of FDR estimation. RAF performs the best when proportion of differentially expressed genes is small and treatment effect is weak, but Localfdr is better than RAF when proportion of differentially expressed genes is large.",2011,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuande Tan"", ids = ""120991041""); list(name = ""Yin Liu"", ids = ""38384860"")",34bab20b6b0e31dd3bc8b95c84f0db27b01a53da; f0b9bc98c502bc24510236b75fd309dfb087f9bb; 5ae778b739b5a0c95a46851b07204e477286b5f0; e918494cadd0b3a54fec579a9e29cafdde520276; 616593f542e93bb67afe437499ad00d49c04d1a7; 0f6aa9cff2daa2538d78d6b7d3679ff55776a08e; c09805ee5b2a9f331df9be9dccfb3b0655c7f6c9,,Bioinformation,7,400 - 404

Genetic Correlation Analysis of Schizophrenia Mirrors Known Epidemiological Relationships and Suggests Novel Associations.,"Abstract In 2015, a new method made it possible to determine shared genetic influences across phenotypes on a scale far greater than ever before. Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSR) allows estimation of genetic correlation, revealing the magnitude and direction of shared genetic effects between pairs of phenotypes. Genetic correlation results for a particular phenotypeâ€”such as schizophreniaâ€”are similar to epidemiological results. They reveal fundamental information relevant to patterns of comorbidityâ€”but are even more informative because the cause (polygenic variation) is known. Here we report genetic correlation analysis of schizophrenia with 172 diverse phenotypes (psychiatric, medical, personality, and metabolic). This was an analytic study design, which leverages large-scale data resources. In all, approximately 1.5 million individuals participated in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that make these analyses possible. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) as implemented in LDHub, and report results with original values, Bonferroni correction, and Benjamani-Hochberg false discovery rates to address multiple testing. The main outcomes and measures are genetic correlations between schizophrenia and 172 phenotypes. As has been previously published, there are positive genetic correlations between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders; the strongest genetic correlation is with bipolar disorder (rgÂ =Â 0.8312, seÂ =Â 0.0369, Â =Â 2.3e-112). Novel findings reveal genetic effects shared between schizophrenia and the personality traits of neuroticism (rgÂ =Â 0.1815, seÂ =Â 0.067, Â =Â .0065) and openness to experience (rgÂ =Â 0.2108, seÂ =Â 0.075, Â =Â .0046), the latter of which contradicts epidemiological observations. All other genetic correlations were consistent with epidemiological evidence. Findings suggest that long recognized comorbidity between various immune processes and schizophrenia, and also cigarette smoking and schizophrenia, are at least partly due to shared genetic influences. In the future, the pattern of genetic correlation results for each phenotypeâ€”a â€œgenetic correlation profileâ€â€”will be common knowledge. These results provide a reasonable first draft of the genetic correlation profile for schizophrenia. They affirmatively answer long-standing questions about the possibility of shared genetic effects on immune, metabolic, and other classes of phenotypes, with schizophrenia. These results also clarify reading of the epidemiological literature, highlighting the lower than average body mass index of individuals prior to developing schizophrenia and prior to taking antipsychotic medications. Results that initially appear surprising may prove to be most useful. These results suggest tractable hypotheses that may lead to major cross-trait discoveries and to reconceptualization of underlying biological processes.",2017,Psychology,"list(name = ""Laramie E.

Disruption of frontoparietal network (FPN) connectivity has emerged as a common footprint across the psychosis spectrum. Our goal was to characterize the static and dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the FPN in antipsychotic-naÃ¯ve first-episode psychosis (FEP) subjects. We compared the static FC of the FPN in 40 FEP and 40 healthy control (HC) subjects, matched on age, sex, and socioeconomic status. To study the dynamic FC, we measured quasiperiodic patterns (QPPs) that consist of infraslow spatioemporal patterns embedded in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal that repeats over time, exhibiting alternation of high and low activity. Relative to HC, we found functional hypoconnectivity between the right middle frontal gyrus and the right middle temporal gyrus, as well as the left inferior temporal gyrus and the left inferior parietal gyrus in FEP (p <â€‰.05, false discovery rate corrected). The correlation of the QPP with all functional scans was significantly stronger for FEP compared to HC, suggesting a greater impact of the QPPs to intrinsic brain activity in psychotic population. Regressing the QPP from the functional scans erased all significant group differences in static FC, suggesting that abnormal connectivity in FEP could result from altered QPP. Our study supports that alterations of cortical information processing are not a function of psychotic chronicity or antipsychotic medication exposure and may be regarded as trait specific. In addition, static connectivity abnormality may be partly related to altered brain network temporal dynamics.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Frederic Briend"", ids = ""1678117560""); list(name = ""William Park Armstrong"", ids = ""40525909""); list(name = ""Nina Vanessa Kraguljac"", ids = ""5360661""); list(name = ""Shella D Keilhloz"", ids = ""1678116591""); list(name = ""Adrienne C Lahti"", ids = ""39746822"")",,,Human brain mapping,,
32806dfefbc74e91ed47c6aa4f85aa20fc7f196f,Exploring shared genetic bases and causal relationships of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with 28 cardiovascular and metabolic traits.,"BACKGROUND
Cardiovascular diseases represent a major health issue in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD), but the exact nature of cardiometabolic (CM) abnormalities involved and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Psychiatric medications are known risk factors, but it is unclear whether there is a connection between the disorders (SCZ/BD) themselves and CM abnormalities.


METHODS
Using polygenic risk scores and linkage disequilibrium score regression, we investigated the shared genetic bases of SCZ and BD with 28 CM traits. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate causal relationships between the two groups of disorders. The analysis was based on large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. We also identified the potential shared genetic variants and inferred the pathways involved.


RESULTS
We found tentative polygenic associations of SCZ with glucose metabolism abnormalities, adverse adipokine profiles, increased waist-to-hip ratio and visceral adiposity (false discovery rate or FDR<0.05). However, there was an inverse association with body mass index. For BD, we observed several polygenic associations with favorable CM profiles at FDR<0.05. MR analysis showed that SCZ may be causally linked to raised triglyceride and that lower fasting glucose may be linked to BD. We also identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and pathways shared between SCZ/BD with CM traits, some of which are related to inflammation or the immune system.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that SCZ patients may be genetically predisposed to several CM abnormalities independent of medication side effects. On the other hand, CM abnormalities in BD may be more likely to be secondary. However, the findings require further validation.",2019,Biology; Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Hon-Cheong So"", ids = ""7233632""); list(name = ""Kwan-Long Chau"", ids = ""51124301""); list(name = ""Fu-Kiu Ao"", ids = ""51112698""); list(name = ""Cheuk-Hei Mo"", ids = ""51117646""); list(name = ""Pak Chung Sham"", ids = ""2613549"")",3b04b1ad1484c7d403818b79f1545d5a728b8da9; 8ad15012737aa1875dce505170699f673a1c78b8; 7a30e22ded06e763fff0077fb5c9ac7f780a40b3; 5d29f9a155280f7b98aba62599073610a34ef0df; f025dbcae85f18765e4c9ad15d1295f2c734e5cc; e03abf3bf6c6419d4e7e1f902ebdd40e68903373,29965b299308fb01bddc8ecf48b6e4c85ea71b5d; 6fe90e6cdeb26b243766c414a78df52fe08a4e08; 88186561254bf4bb8bff3706862b48b040a3a294; 7c9c96531aae7afc6bdfbcb1a6e03b20d779a17d; ad3d6b05f67b6417d7ad6ee3647c50d32857ab44; de1b10ac205e72fefed07ddc4c7a29515e311367; 6ed47bd124e98c101ca64a5fa53ec14de368ca75; 753447af50cc40fa31a9c5cd06258d7651d782a7; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 7f95ba432a75a3fcb9097f8ac3b83e605fbb6ad9; 5aeb84e2bad24170774608f3de001cf24faaf84a; 49854802ad8bba03a400610472988bad036d0111; 73c58996bb6c8495f278581b2a5906bf9e34e1b5; 3f9a0cbb86f8329d9da98f88313e06135bdbd3f5; 32d4e2d0e52288c3b7b83d572e0fdb87fa5ee054; 44391362cc0ac5db49f94263138e1dda580a5e72; e47ffe5401eb6c20adf1e412f72c3367f2a66f0e; a125584b8d7d7a5be27e3f0e32a79dcec8afe08d; ba1f227d7f2cb6c6d722ab31cc2e80ab569ef586; 2ef3c6b765d38982f2e5b390f11c4471f54ea106; 8722578c19b0837b2d601cad6479151354616bc9; 9b1f96fc3fe36cbb560bff9777f2d0b9429cb9ae; 9e0d8528dcec37861c86ab08f053245b613a06ef; a692be9eb03b4f7181715f8d9cf1d0c2f165c3bb; 0587fdc0c6715788ef492b5f9d22eb1609f19b6f; d1c64155ca0250ed6eb8e7396bfbea683ab1280b; e3c166f2c52125723e737a620c175a74a6d15299; 0b2c9bdda6d95caa9e1e85bc62b449987aed1a83; 7fa3d065080eb1b97bda9c727d3829911810fcde; 9d735f94ca87ca9f6929b2001416f423e388d591; 37fc45fc2bd4be8e39cc2bf825598511c4889b1c; da8ba7760907ba9825394c53424acb28e26cd5b0; 665a16f532029f65b8666aace2144760e5fab60c; efd759524d97c9354b1a96292099729825d2ec6e; bc461c5c027d68c453921c41411bf55555d4902c; 4f7a5bddc658cd53df7df8a51fc3e3960a4f5071; f172d6d25c30ce145b612009d3518d9542de6fc9; 84291ca202e2ada33d3ba8326e3a0ea430e9f0f0; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; 8c32c2152ee894edfb8602a52c3a90520d73944a; df1aeb37250932082c1b74f364f473089908f70c; 036d7b6b85f93a2b071c0354cbc0f811a1919829; ffe7cbcce95c1208d488b0e57d566e36cdf7c72f; c4f2dc08803381564df399d0f32673ef164fc4c4; b798e74cf8954daae13e4b31c4fed5f4a78035ec; 3c423f11a016b4fd8e170c08cf7dbef20eadb2d7; 744986f7ce904543c37cc0fb9a34af6937a2f829; 11a3ac464b7cc5afe48172efe12ce4346dbf452d; 1fe60ac699d283658131059c2fa967d43fadd8d7; 6a77feacc77f57c5a4f8e417ce9c2a5d7a7f4d42; f69aed84afc531459e3af035203e51be9f48bba6; e447f1d23589f94600f098e2eb49c2dcb6b5bd14; fdd294614ccdd907a8db1746fc116a383e4e4a68; d6ae3b912d5e4f0edd91c2c2736a89caaf73b128; 3193da63f068dc95a5ac9a8fb3810e9ba2c80cd0; dfb897857a2c2dac8f656ea44362287274ed33a1; f74fa858373753c18af59f8a377cfc8ec4492c7f; eac49cffed5ac727cc4132e5ebd77a3b3bedc50f; c3bdfd259d5020b172262296cdf4fba2942828ae; 721a5fd127edd33a83d06ffc9ed293f1486200ef; 7079b5a0ba569fd5906e206707403d7f8161bb80; 8dccc62fadea27268a0f9c732754e8dc372bdb39; 5897310483bd1bfd34842fb27b59e173bc883fde,Psychological medicine,49 8,"

cc57aab91ebba428ee1c0c57568847acfbf70fd7,Membrane proteomic signatures of karyotypically normal and abnormal human embryonic stem cell lines and derivatives.,"Cultured human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived derivatives contain heterogeneous cell populations with varying degrees of differentiation and karyotypic stability. The inability to isolate homogenous population presents a challenge toward cell-based applications and therapies. A proteomics approach was utilized to discover novel membrane proteins able to distinguish between the hESC lines BG01, WA09, and abBG02 (trisomy 12, 14, 17 and an extra copy of the X chromosome), along with WA09-derived human neural progenitor (hNP) cells. Membrane protein signatures were developed using sucrose-gradient isolation, 1-D gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel digestion and analysis by reverse phase chromatography coupled to ion trap-FT-ICR. At a â‰¤1.0% false discovery rate, 1918 proteins were identified; 775 were annotated as membrane proteins and 720 predicted to contain transmembrane spanning regions. Flow cytometry was used to validate cell surface expression of selected proteins. Junctional adhesion molecule 1 expression was shared by BG01, BG02 and abBG02 hESC lines. Dysferlin expression was specific to the WA09 hESC line and not the derived neural or mesenchymal progenitors. Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor distinguished WA09-derived human neural progenitor cells from the parent hESC population, and WA09-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells. This study expands the current membrane protein data set for hESCs.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Brian A.

3748b97f288316025b17020e0ab18300e6dc3cc5,The associations of self-rated health with cardiovascular risk proteins: a proteomics approach,"BackgroundThough subjective, poor self-rated health (SRH) has consistently been shown to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD). The underlying mechanism is unclear. This study evaluates the associations of SRH with biomarkers for CVD, aiming to explore potential pathways between poor SRH and CVD.MethodsBased on the MalmÃ¶ Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort study, a targeted proteomics approach was used to assess the associations of SRH with 88 cardiovascular risk proteins, measured in plasma from 4521 participants without CVD. The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using the Benjamini and Hochberg method. Covariates taken into consideration were age, sex, traditional CVD risk factors (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, anti-hypertensive medication, diabetes, body mass index, smoking), comorbidity, life-style and psycho-social factors (education level, living alone, alcohol consumption, low physical activity, psychiatric medication, sleep duration, and unemployment).ResultsAge and sex-adjusted associations with SRH was found for 34 plasma proteins. Nine of them remained significant after adjustments for traditional CVD risk factors. After further adjustment for comorbidity, life-style and psycho-social factors, only leptin (Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.035, corrected pâ€‰=â€‰0.016) and Câ€“C motif chemokine 20 (CCL20; Î²â€‰=â€‰âˆ’â€‰0.054, corrected pâ€‰=â€‰0.016) were significantly associated with SRH.ConclusionsPoor SRH was associated with raised concentrations of many plasma proteins. However, the relationships were largely attenuated by adjustments for CVD risk factors, comorbidity and psycho-social factors. Leptin and CCL20 were associated with poor SRH in the present study and could potentially be involved in the SRHâ€“CVD link.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xue Bao"", ids = ""152742452""); list(name = ""Yan BornÃ©"", ids = ""5008961""); list(name = ""Songjiang Yin"", ids = ""1410179988""); list(name = ""Kaijun Niu"", ids = ""143936264""); list(name = ""Marju Orho-Melander"", ids = ""1396245444""); list(name = ""Jan Nilsson"", ids = ""152137576""); list(name = ""Olle Melander"", ids = ""4658308""); list(name = ""Gunnar EngstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""49770408"")",,2eb62b0f3427dace262bd963c9c813c9daab025e; 20ad7c39b49fa6d5bbe3604aaf54a8cc938130dd; c53e76463d9e31e9464dc18ce1e6c4a3db86d93f; 8a482e25034109c3960e719fa43aeb881fd5de39; 922313748a180ca5f2f5151f6acff8306e0c9cb5; c4fb0a03e6aa2d51195d6b35604162581efc033a; 514d561d6707239a208d983700395898f63cf10f; 14dd61245a0257d9236d003a92171c3515a3bc87; ce1ae644d3f15045eed77403a72490fd70a36dfe; 97c4cf3eb64694e28f341bcf92df40285a789c86; 68e357daebf4d3c206fe34e3d98835cf2e71eb1c; c47cf90a4d8c3be9570e9ed381d12ecebd18047b; f75f12272bb0f9033b33a40019d21d9cf88687c8; 20ae7384a8fa0c140711dcc31fdbbc539709d4b6; f81e2e6928a46f68c33903300967016e7a38cc74; f53339ef8824022cd510eeb6552369575d245ddd; 1712bf92538f370ee57a2f7617af1adb64e8fe72; fea9ecd8876757e534c1353462402dcb2fdde5c0; 2464deca97f599c80c6fc56fa9b4a89a3f5a4aec; fc4e7698bec47eff4ea3d2b502891326ba2a2be1; 8451f62634593b2e4d5376fe2ff5bdacbb1f97c8; 34d47586bafb2c7cec6fa2381f4c3fc9393f607a; 5f202bdd4da176dc2d7c8eea3d396e019f7e94f7; 185d31c5f2f5ccd4e20ac50a3eadc5cd5235fe06; 34b9635d7779e219e9d60e0d3d33919ca9bc123c; d5755c7617637ea7f50d0b52f67667494fc2270b; 19e31328370f03176f369e031f50f7f269249316; 693bd7845246f4544e4607a3e6caa3b8d0b4e976; 5180edb259c59ee6d3091e5009ede2aef472e3dc; 96d96da8016e9942db69dd154a0e1b46ed5a95c7; 6bfa36713ba180d7f7e2ed4f2e58d5e9eaa5f79d; 6fd432622b59762188a78367584575fffd109678; 5c549f3abe716a11197053077df58b0e5d52cfdd; 37c4ba2a67c85c04b3257659889b6aa37f5a1838; ab14cc58e86209cf9ecb79630b67b4084ae867ce; 0eb5a1ecc9984d8c7b1ab06807d1a4ca64dfb47e; 180110a5dcfac4bd3c80884b3ed0a37771ef4344; 64ba436b26597d149197a0d3a13cc04b80d0b479; 2cde5a744171578ca9eef12437972a9d009b0917; 92ba121897cac932b194c180ef1ba0e4d5910f58; e049ba961fcf2e7d8188322c115c4bfaf80ee4e1; f6bfed799b53c8aa2ff373b0bf3056d310e8cbc2; c6d1baff006f163da82bc76a70c82a97c6c8095e; e6cefe1c71b9b70541d03f65be798f921812d0d3; da0af37ec8bbbad22d01ef24a808f4da23600ac2; 89afa2d4a5b0d0e8492030dd1bf28e79e6d4ffdf; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 58270fb9a51ccd17dcc5bd9c8a51e0fe5be8fbc1; 84a56001a4fd39cd305d172bd46127e639b298b1; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 577fa848970d55bcfc21c6027c07bd6cfecb302f; f4392790babe1fcd8153ac85260d194fb20d2a16; 603c686f713935b64b705ac7b967d698204d48a6,Clinical Proteomics,16,
aa67102b0dd2b611f6aecf5f94d7c78928213cee,Lung ischaemia-reperfusion induced gene expression.,"OBJECTIVES
Pulmonary dysfunction following lung ischaemia-reperfusion is a well-known phenomenon, which may contribute to post-cardiac surgical morbidity. The process is associated with pulmonary inflammatory response and cellular apoptosis. Early molecular mechanisms leading to such lung injury remain largely unknown. We examined whether lung ischaemia and reperfusion cause significant expression changes in numerous genes in the lungs involved in pulmonary apoptosis and other cellular processes by using oligonucleotide microarrays in an experimental model of rodent lung ischaemia-reperfusion injury.


METHODS
Sprague-Dawley rodents (n=5 in each group) were anaesthetised and underwent controlled ventilation, with varying durations of warm lung ischaemia (60 and 90 min) followed by a short reperfusion period. The right middle lobe of the lung was harvested. Gene expression changes in the lungs were analysed by rodent DNA microarray chips, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed to validate changes in gene expression.


RESULTS
Significant expression changes, with reference to false discovery rate (FDR) controls, were detected in over 80 genes following controlled lung ventilation, and more than 50 were up-regulated more than 2-fold. Lung ischaemia-reperfusion caused expression changes in over 50 additional genes, including many novel genes not previously associated with lung ischaemia-reperfusion. Up-regulated genes identified include those associated with apoptosis, inflammation and cell-cycle control.


CONCLUSIONS
Large numbers of genes relating to cell metabolism, transcription control, inflammation and apoptosis were significantly up- and down-regulated following controlled ventilation and early lung ischaemia-reperfusion, consistent with previous studies. In addition, novel genes related to lung injury were identified. These genetic signatures provide new insights into early molecular mechanisms of ischaemia-reperfusion lung injury and help refine therapeutic strategies to lessen pulmonary dysfunction following cardiac surgery.",2010,Medicine,"list(name = ""Calvin S.H.

7725775ec466fa4808093b1c1946c26af0a8860f,Does early blindness significantly enhance arithmetic? Yes it does. A reply to Fischer's commentary,"We thank Prof. Fischer for his interest in our paper on arithmetic processing in blind individuals (Dormal, Crollen, Baumans, Lepore, & Collignon, 2016). In his commentary, Prof. Fischer identifies statistical concerns related to our analyses and raises strong doubts about the validity of our results and their interpretations. He highlighted and developed three main points. The first question concerns the preliminary verification of equal variance assumption when two independent sample ttests were used. Prof. Fischer assumes that we did not take into account the fact that our three groups (early blind e EB, late blind e LB, sighted control e SC) had unequal variances. This statement is factually wrong, as we actually did take into account this variance unequality. Since inequality of the variances has first been detected by the Levene test, the Welch-Satterthwaite adjustment method proposed by the SPSS software package (version 24.0) was applied and the corrected p-values (respectively .034 and .020 for the comparison of EB group with the LB and the SC groups) was then reported in our results section. Therefore, the suggested inconsistencies concerning our p-values identified by Fischer does not exist, our results reflecting the corrected p-values while using the appropriate correction for unequal variance. Concerning the second point, I acknowledge the point raised as I omitted to apply a correction for multiple comparisons for the three independent t-tests performed. As pointed by Prof. Fischer himself, Zieffler, Harring, and Long (2011), discussing different methods for correcting for multiple comparisons, suggest that the false discovery rate method (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) â€œstrikes a good balance between protection from a false positive and the ability to reject a false null hypothesisâ€ (p. 275). When the BenjaminiHochberg procedure is applied to our comparisons, adjusted p-values of .051 between EB and SC and between EB and SC were found. While this omission is indeed a mistake, it does not modify the results and conclusions that can be drawn from our data, and asserting that our comparisons were no longer valid after adequate correction for multiple comparisons appears to be abusive. Importantly, several standard procedures were followed in order tominimize the occurrence of false positive (e.g., Szucs, 2016): (i) Sample size determination (between 10 and 15 participants for each of the three groups) was preliminary defined according to the current standard sample size observed in the literature in this field of research (e.g., Castronovo & Delvenne, 2013; Nava, Steiger, & Râ‚¬ oder, 2014; Pasqualotto, Lam, & Proulx, 2013); (ii) standard parametric analyses were performed, while all the comparisons and effect size were reported; (iii) no covariate, nor transformation of data was applied and (iv) for a total transparency, raw data were graphically represented in the supplemental materials. Finally, the question of small samples comparison is an argument widely debated in the literature and which is frequently used in an abusive manner to inappropriately try to overshadow robust results obtained with, relatively speaking, low sample size (Friston, 2012).

However, the biological mechanisms underlying this association are not completely understood.MethodsWe analyzed messenger RNA (mRNA) microarray data from both invasive breast tumors (Nâ€‰=â€‰602) and tumor-adjacent normal tissues (Nâ€‰=â€‰508) from participants diagnosed with breast cancer in the Nursesâ€™ Health Study (NHS) and NHSII. Multivariable linear regression, controlling for other known breast cancer risk factors, was used to identify differentially expressed genes by pre-diagnostic alcohol intake. For pathway analysis, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Differentially expressed genes or enriched pathway-defined gene sets with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.1 identified in tumors were validated in RNA sequencing data of invasive breast tumors (Nâ€‰=â€‰166) from The Cancer Genome Atlas.ResultsNo individual genes were significantly differentially expressed by alcohol consumption in the NHS/NHSII. However, GSEA identified 33 and 68 pathway-defined gene sets at FDR <0.1 among 471 ER+ and 127 ER- tumors, respectively, all of which were validated. Among ER+ tumors, consuming 10+ grams of alcohol per day (vs. 0) was associated with upregulation in RNA metabolism and transport, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, and downregulation in lipid metabolism. Among ER- tumors, in addition to upregulation in RNA processing and cell cycle, alcohol intake was linked to overexpression of genes involved in cytokine signaling, including interferon and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î² signaling pathways, and translation and post-translational modifications. Lower lipid metabolism was observed in both ER+ tumors and ER+ tumor-adjacent normal samples. Most of the significantly enriched gene sets identified in ER- tumors showed a similar enrichment pattern among ER- tumor-adjacent normal tissues.ConclusionsOur data suggest that moderate alcohol consumption (i.e. 10+ grams/day, equivalent to one or more drinks/day) is associated with several specific and reproducible biological processes and pathways, which adds potential new insight into alcohol-related breast carcinogenesis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jun Wang"", ids = ""39272609""); list(name = ""Yujing J.

9281621426b462620842560aca7bf3948cabe168,Genome-Wide Transcriptional Profiling Reveals MicroRNA-Correlated Genes and Biological Processes in Human Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines,"BACKGROUND
Expression level of many genes shows abundant natural variation in human populations. The variations in gene expression are believed to contribute to phenotypic differences. Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the key regulators of gene expression. However, past studies have focused on the miRNA target genes and used loss- or gain-of-function approach that may not reflect natural association between miRNA and mRNAs.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
To examine miRNA regulatory effect on global gene expression under endogenous condition, we performed pair-wise correlation coefficient analysis on expression levels of 366 miRNAs and 14,174 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in 90 immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and observed significant correlations between the two species of RNA transcripts. We identified a total of 7,207 significantly correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs (false discovery rate q<0.01). Of those, 4,085 pairs showed positive correlations while 3,122 pairs showed negative correlations. Gene ontology analyses on the miRNA-correlated genes revealed significant enrichments in several biological processes related to cell cycle, cell communication and signal transduction. Individually, each of three miRNAs (miR-331, -98 and -33b) demonstrated significant correlation with the genes in cell cycle-related biological processes, which is consistent with important role of miRNAs in cell cycle regulation.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
This study demonstrates feasibility of using naturally expressed transcript profiles to identify endogenous correlation between miRNA and miRNA. By applying this genome-wide approach, we have identified thousands of miRNA-correlated genes and revealed potential role of miRNAs in several important cellular functions. The study results along with accompanying data sets will provide a wealth of high-throughput data to further evaluate the miRNA-regulated genes and eventually in phenotypic variations of human populations.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Liang Wang"", ids = ""48169685""); list(name = ""Ann L.

For discrete data, the SGoF method may be very conservative. In this paper, we introduce an alternative SGoF-type procedure that takes into account the discreteness of the test statistics. Like the original SGoF, our new method provides weak control of the false discovery rate/familywise error rate but attains false discovery rate levels closer to the desired nominal level, and thus it is more powerful. We study the performance of this method in a simulation study and illustrate its application to a real pharmacovigilance data set.",2017,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Irene Castro-Conde"", ids = ""1401810536""); list(name = ""Sebastian DÃ¶hler"", ids = ""2380784""); list(name = ""Jacobo de UÃ±a-Ã\201lvarez"", ids = ""1401375357"")",e60aca2e83d9063a92c3698e6dc350887dea021c,2c5079bcd7c00c2e3568d2a164c99778ceec2570; cc41ee17b75f97c7859d27a678f368d2ad9768be; 858ebcba255653003d19f6a1b2a6935e9ec78c3d; d2af3c5b1f34a440baa5974e0546bc8201897fda; 05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe; 74c6bbfc9efa61421cc85d9891153e99c0cbaa0b; e5d98e8f6e405c6d98f0d81f92e04cd992ede1b9; 9313246ef7222ad6535b54f58fb7ed7b08310994; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; 53a4df4d2591bfee571ecb65ed011dc772379e9d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; a37f0491f1a2e41f5aeac59d6c6e8c651007b33f; 6e1f93ec4f97c2b334a556fe71abc2b192d1c021; da571e9cc5e1d067e9848da6a235558926f4f46f; 57769788f2b55f5908c4812bda340221e4edff75; 43a37d20a16482c9249f34c25c0e354dd845adce; a03270a32ee34fe08214d696fda472601a80a449; 9f9ab578e4ba515408721fa654c42d9796045379; fa3611acf748674c9e74727cf2fbf45b55648d1f; 09f3572aba38c4268720c60fe14d63033bef1956; 3a5fb157b2a210cd28d34c9eff42125c2dd9bf63; e1218ceea3e1a253a212431d81d10419c798cf3c; 2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; c4465436014be9baae12aeee01880ff4c9571e8a; eab669a51f7a7321092998cc79150d306d708647; 56defcc4d278c24e8517a43ad6e739b760622f1d; 1b5c2b9443ece9a336efe247817f0153caed2ebd; 0acec919dfb7485853f190dcd77baf15a640e7ac; e74769f8b8224ad001f3b5ec56884a5b4a83a12e; 9b152ba83ab1257f15b79b7fde64fdbce8749260; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 18f677e5ee3f15a5531f45052a2bc78c15a800a4; 10ee8d84cd863a15ef9e5d78f7959e78b9be5616; 21e6ddaea5dd700a33eca5b97ce31a9bedfcf88a,Statistical Methods in Medical Research,26,2356 - 2375
56f76d7b283fad276eaeaf5a86b3516cbf8c3e68,Evaluating Statistical Methods Using Plasmode Data Sets in the Age of Massive Public Databases: An Illustration Using False Discovery Rates,"Plasmode is a term coined several years ago to describe data sets that are derived from real data but for which some truth is known. Omic techniques, most especially microarray and genomewide association studies, have catalyzed a new zeitgeist of data sharing that is making data and data sets publicly available on an unprecedented scale. Coupling such data resources with a science of plasmode use would allow statistical methodologists to vet proposed techniques empirically (as opposed to only theoretically) and with data that are by definition realistic and representative. We illustrate the technique of empirical statistics by consideration of a common task when analyzing high dimensional data: the simultaneous testing of hundreds or thousands of hypotheses to determine which, if any, show statistical significance warranting follow-on research. The now-common practice of multiple testing in high dimensional experiment (HDE) settings has generated new methods for detecting statistically significant results. Although such methods have heretofore been subject to comparative performance analysis using simulated data, simulating data that realistically reflect data from an actual HDE remains a challenge. We describe a simulation procedure using actual data from an HDE where some truth regarding parameters of interest is known. We use the procedure to compare estimates for the proportion of true null hypotheses, the false discovery rate (FDR), and a local version of FDR obtained from 15 different statistical methods.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gary L.

df0a086a7577047e86b617a3c88fb4ae22a498a1,Subcortical structural volumes in recently remitted first episode mania.,"BACKGROUND
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have yielded inconsistent findings with regard to subcortical volumetric abnormalities in patients with bipolar I disorder. Duration of illness and long term medication intake could have confounded the findings.


METHOD
Volumes of nine subcortical structures were compared between 63 patients who recently remitted from their first manic episode and 77 healthy volunteers. The volumetric segmentation was performed with the automated segmentation algorithm Freesurfer version 5.1.


RESULTS
There were no significant volumetric differences between the two groups in any of the structures examined including caudate, putamen, globus pallidum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus and lateral ventricles (q > 0.05-false discovery rate corrected).


LIMITATIONS
All patients were on psychotropic medications at the time of scanning, which might have confounded the results. Sample size may not be large enough to detect small volumetric changes.


CONCLUSIONS
Patients with bipolar I disorder do not appear to have any significant subcortical volumetric abnormalities during the early stage of the disease.

1ed178fe4feaae23e045353bc3f5bd5c625e6b56,A Highly Predictive Model for Diagnosis of Colorectal Neoplasms Using Plasma MicroRNA city and Sensitivity Improving Specifi,"Objective: To develop a plasma-based microRNA (miRNA) diagnostic assay specific for colorectal neoplasms, building upon our prior work. Background: Colorectal neoplasms [colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal advanced adenoma (CAA)] frequently develop in individuals at ages when other common cancers also occur. Current screening methods lack sensitivity, specificity, and have poor patient compliance. Methods: Plasma was screened for 380 miRNAs using microfluidic array technology from a â€˜â€˜Trainingâ€™â€™ cohort of 60 patients, (10 each) control, CRC, CAA, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. We identified uniquely dysregulated miRNAs specific for colorectal neoplasia (P < 0.05, false discovery rate: 5%, adjusted a 1â„4 0.0038). These miRNAs were evaluated using single assays in a â€˜â€˜Testâ€™â€™ cohort of 120 patients. A mathematical model was developed to predict blinded sample identity in a 150 patient â€˜â€˜Validationâ€™â€™ cohort using repeat-sub-sampling validation of the testing dataset with 1000 iterations each to assess model detection accuracy. Results: Seven miRNAs (miR-21, miR-29c, miR-122, miR-192, miR-346, miR-372, and miR-374a) were selected based upon P value, area under the curve (AUC), fold change, and biological plausibility. Area under the curve ( 95% confidence interval) for â€˜â€˜Testâ€™â€™ cohort comparisons were 0.91 (0.85â€“ 0.96) between all neoplasia and controls, 0.79 (0.70â€“0.88) between colorectal neoplasia and other cancers, and 0.98 (0.96â€“1.0) between CRC and colorectal adenomas. In our â€˜â€˜Validationâ€™â€™ cohort, our mathematical model predicted blinded sample identity with 69% to 77% accuracy, 67% to 76% accuracy, and",2016,,"list(name = ""Jane Victoria Carter"", ids = ""30461228""); list(name = ""Henry L.

To establish DNA microarrays-based microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of squamous cell carcinoma of larynx, using archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, and to screen out and identify the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with the biological characteristics of this malignant disease.


METHODS
Total RNA was prepared from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. After quality identification and fluorescent labeling, the RNA samples were hybridized with the Agilent human miRNA microarrays which contains 723 probes for human miRNAs. The data was processed with the softwares GeneSpring GX and R-Project.


RESULTS
From the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks collected, 24 RNA samples were obtained with the quality accorded to the requirement of miRNA microarray analysis, and both the hybridization and consequent data processing were accomplished. A total of 319 miRNAs were identified and among them 96 were detected in all the 24 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of laryngeal carcinoma; and 5 differentially expressed miRNAs (false discovery rate < 0.05) were found to be associated significantly with the lymphatic metastasis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.05), including miR-23a(*), miR-28-5p, miR-15a, miR-16 and miR-425.


CONCLUSIONS
Histopathological archives of well-annotated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens are the valuable resources for miRNA study including to collect RNA samples for miRNA microarray analysis. A panel of differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-23a(*), miR-28-5p, miR-15a, miR-16 and miR-425) derived from the miRNA expression profile may serve as the potential molecular biomarkers for the prediction of metastasis development in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lin Li"", ids = ""143831923""); list(name = ""Zong-min Zhang"", ids = ""12344885""); list(name = ""Yu Liu"", ids = ""40349233""); list(name = ""Ming-Hui Wei"", ids = ""38351405""); list(name = ""Li-yan Xue"", ids = ""7925112""); list(name = ""Shuang-mei Zou"", ids = ""35703255""); list(name = ""Xue-bing Di"", ids = ""15450140""); list(name = ""Nai-jun Han"", ids = ""13383681""); list(name = ""Kai-tai Zhang"", ids = ""11389566""); list(name = ""Zhengang Xu"", ids = ""115788751""); list(name = ""Yan-ning Gao"", ids = ""13318027"")",d7eb439ea9e859768c4e8bd5b88e9ca20963e823; 9d830265b60e9230fa03119325aa9fcf3bd82a80; 1ff4d878cc903da8c89949c98caf9bbc52398960; e91939194e94fa794595ecfc80faeea8faa36da0; 69cb35225c78771fe527c9bd91cd58fedd990cea,,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,39 6,"

461a2f752f41d6debcbeac2f69047201bfcf9ebc,The Volume of Hippocampal Subfields in Relation to Decline of Memory Recall Across the Adult Lifespan,"Background: The hippocampus is an important limbic structure closely related to memory function. However, few studies have focused on the association between hippocampal subfields and age-related memory decline. We investigated the volume alterations of hippocampal subfields at different ages and assessed the correlations with Immediate and Delayed recall abilities. Materials and Methods: A total of 275 participants aged 20-89 years were classified into 4 groups: Young, 20-35 years; Middle-early, 36-50 years; Middle-late, 51-65 years; Old, 66-89 years. All data were acquired from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS). The volumes of hippocampal subfields were obtained using Freesurfer software. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to analyze alterations of subfield volumes among the 4 groups, and multiple comparisons between groups were performed using the Bonferroni method. Spearman correlation with false discovery rate correction was used to investigate the relationship between memory recall scores and hippocampal subfield volumes. Results: Apart from no significant difference in the left parasubiculum (P = 0.269) and a slight difference in the right parasubiculum (P = 0.022), the volumes of other hippocampal subfields were significantly different across the adult lifespan (P < 0.001). The hippocampal fissure volume was increased in the Old group, while volumes for other subfields decreased. In addition, Immediate recall scores were associated with volumes of the bilateral molecular layer, granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-DG), cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/3, CA4, left fimbria and hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA), and right fissure (P < 0.05). Delayed recall scores were associated with the bilateral molecular layer, GC-DG, CA2/3 and CA4; left tail, presubiculum, CA1, subiculum, fimbria and HATA (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The parasubiculum volume was not significantly different across the adult lifespan, while atrophy in dementia patients in some studies. Based on these findings, we speculate that volume changes in this region might be considered as a biomarker for dementia disorders. Additionally, several hippocampal subfield volumes were significantly associated with memory scores, further highlighting the key role of the hippocampus in age-related memory decline.

These studies were based on a striatal region on interest approach that may have underestimated these effects and could not evaluate extrastriatal regions. Our aim was to determine the effects at the voxel level of age and gender on whole-brain DaT distribution using [123I]FP-CIT SPECT in healthy subjects.MethodsWe performed a whole-brain [123I]FP-CIT SPECT voxel-based analysis using SPM8 and a standardized normalization template (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, corrected using the false discovery rate method) in 51 healthy subjects aged from 21 to 79Â years.ResultsWe found an age-related DaT binding decrease in the striatum, anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortices and insulo-opercular cortices. Also DaT binding ratios were higher in women than men in the striatum and opercular cortices.ConclusionThis study showed both striatal and extrastriatal age-related and gender-related differences in DaT binding in healthy subjects using a whole-brain voxel-based non-a priori approach.

aac20bf38e7bcc85909aebe7c7b5cee1f2c68340,Amultiple testing procedure for multi-dimensional pairwise comparisons with application to gene expression studies,"Background: Often researchers are interested in comparing multiple experimental groups (e.g. tumor size) with a reference group (e.g. normal tissue) on the basis of thousands of features (e.g. genes) and determine if a differentially expressed feature is up or down regulated in a pairwise comparison. There are two sources of false discoveries, one due to multiple testing involving several pairwise comparisons and the second due to falsely declaring a feature to be up (or down) regulated when it is not (known as directional error). Together, the total error rate is called the mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR). Results: We develop a general powerful mdFDR controlling testing procedure and illustrate the methodology by analyzing uterine fibroid gene expression data (PLoS ONE 8:63909, 2013). We identify several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways that are specifically enriched according to the size of a uterine fibroid. Conclusions: The proposed general procedure strongly controls mdFDR. Several specific methodologies can be derived from this general methodology by using appropriate testing procedures at different steps of the general procedure. Thus we are providing a general framework for making multiple pairwise comparisons. Our analysis of the uterine fibroid growth gene expression data suggests that molecular characteristics of a fibroid changes with size. Our powerful methodology allowed us to draw several interesting conclusions regarding the molecular characteristics of uterine fibroids. For example, IL-1 signaling pathway (Sci STKE 2003:3, 2003), associated with inflammation and known to activate prostaglandins that are implicated in the progression of fibroids, is significantly enriched only in small tumors (volume < 5.7 cm3). It appears that the molecular apparatus necessary for fibroid growth and development is established during tumor development. A complete list of all DEGs and the corresponding enriched pathways according to tumor size is provided for researchers to mine these data. Identification of these DEGs and the pathways may potentially have clinical implications.",2016,,"list(name = ""Anjana Grandhi"", ids = ""3380309""); list(name = ""Wenge Guo"", ids = ""39843221""); list(name = ""Shyamal Das Peddada"", ids = ""145423393"")",,b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990; 9c2f04617a89259f704c98fd2c0b1b79b919f8f5; f1ac8c17d76185fe7d5b43f9ed41dc11a1295d60; 403f7d068467e0293350f070359f11435a516a10; d5afaf6e7488f61036c5e83db9830c11e60f0fc5; 3c7787c71487fb8acf5d0d35d43e8b42dc04d392; 0592c5093d9c2d95713e9a2f35f3779be07be681; 24d91083686b55508e9efcb67ed7f4ce8e2dfa0b; 24bcd56a1d7dba69d8e4e541ffebbe2b3cda45c5; ac65e95c0a9b2ded7de8707403752d96db4f62fc; 7f80b2c231042fbfcdf4427302b6861dc898795f; 458ecc864559b973c01c218b37d6ab01b2df4cbf; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 5ef1b4f5c7bd9a116e99f7f1eda4527449a6482b; c4bcc1c5997634f3cd7e963882909ded9bce3b49; 0f7a0a17c58de40e6b9065410a6ff018fde52246; 5e640f2cda138de181cd861df1f098f779c09802; 4d999d8f888d51e1a7bc33f9b37a1146a066227d; b2c1f17633404284c922d6bf7c8a65b0d553e65b; 78603e67dff78cfa9546ac81e9d13902b2c81dc4; c2062276f5d919c471ffb0c461c6b94dc2700709; 9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; eb80fe9cffb178271c4e52acc5d3b73d6c9e7dc5; 2d36b057617d01e2e869de5297e041f4e9cd2997; 386c2d7ea9b5940f2aba6c71799bb811dec9b974; bf5f30c81816b5e4cb7d74ab6a902d152538c6fb; 1c828fb68851c415aed129397ed267dc25ba36db; 1107c4cc13fbb98d33186764c807761aee4e66d1; ac3f02f8915a3060710dfacddef49cd04aaa58a6; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; cb4d42bded6b84e492dc391265daa8835d3957cd; 8e99ca23909d5adf4ccd06cd796d69376c24c6b0,,,

The k-FWER, a generalized version of the usual familywise error rate (FWER), is such an error rate that has recently been introduced in the literature and procedures controlling it have been proposed. A further generalization of a result on the k-FWER is provided in this article. In addition, an alternative and less conservative notion of error rate, the k-FDR, is introduced in the same spirit as the k-FWER by generalizing the usual false discovery rate (FDR). A k-FWER procedure is constructed given any set of increasing constants by utilizing the kth order joint null distributions of the p-values without assuming any specific form of dependence among all the p-values. Procedures controlling the k-FDR are also developed by using the kth order joint null distributions of the p-values, first assuming that the sets of null and nonnull p-values are mutually independent or they are jointly positively dependent in the sense of being multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP2) and then discarding that assumption about the overall dependence among the p-values.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

c35d33967530a8189b2ea776b6d957853eb6ac6c,A Bayesian Approach for Detecting Mass-Extinction Events When Rates of Lineage Diversification Vary,"The paleontological record chronicles numerous episodes of mass extinction that severely culled the Tree of Life. Biologists have long sought to assess the extent to which these events may have impacted particular groups. We present a novel method for detecting mass-extinction events from phylogenies estimated from molecular sequence data. We develop our approach in a Bayesian statistical framework, which enables us to harness prior information on the frequency and magnitude of mass-extinction events. The approach is based on an episodic stochastic-branching process model in which rates of speciation and extinction are constant between rate-shift events. We model three types of events: (1) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in speciation rate; (2) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in extinction rate, and; (3) instantaneous tree-wide mass-extinction events. Each of the events is described by a separate compound Poisson process (CPP) model, where the waiting times between each event are exponentially distributed with event-specific rate parameters. The magnitude of each event is drawn from an event-type specific prior distribution. Parameters of the model are then estimated using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm. We demonstrate via simulation that this method has substantial power to detect the number of mass-extinction events, provides unbiased estimates of the timing of mass-extinction events, while exhibiting an appropriate (i.e., below 5%) false discovery rate even in the case of background diversification rate variation. Finally, we provide an empirical application of this approach to conifers, which reveals that this group has experienced two major episodes of mass extinction. This new approachâ€”the CPP on Mass Extinction Times (CoMET) modelâ€”provides an effective tool for identifying mass-extinction events from molecular phylogenies, even when the history of those groups includes more prosaic temporal variation in diversification rate.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Michael R.

Array CGH measures DNA copy number and gene expression microarrays measure the amount of mRNA. Methods that integrate data from these two platforms may uncover meaningful biological relationships that further our understanding of cancer. We develop nonparametric tests for the detection of copy number induced differential gene expression. The tests incorporate the uncertainty of the calling of genomic aberrations. The test is preceded by a ""tuning algorithm"" that discards certain genes to improve the overall power of the false discovery rate selection procedure. Moreover, the test statistics are ""shrunken"" to borrow information across neighboring genes that share the same array CGH signature. For each gene we also estimate its effect, its amount of differential expression due to copy number changes, and calculate the coefficient of determination.

d7a2290afec8cbf68946c66a511d0823a5eb1253,Error estimates for the analysis of differential expression from RNA-seq count data,"Background. A number of algorithms exist for analysing RNA-sequencing data to infer profiles of differential gene expression. Problems inherent in building algorithms around statistical models of over dispersed count data are formidable and frequently lead to non-uniform p-value distributions for null-hypothesis data and to inaccurate estimates of false discovery rates (FDRs). This can lead to an inaccurate measure of significance and loss of power to detect differential expression. Results. We use synthetic and real biological data to assess the ability of several available R packages to accurately estimate FDRs. The packages surveyed are based on statistical models of overdispersed Poisson data and include edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2, PoissonSeq and QuasiSeq. Also tested is an add-on package to edgeR and DESeq which we introduce called Polyfit. Polyfit aims to address the problem of a non-uniform null p-value distribution for two-class datasets by adapting the Storey-Tibshirani procedure. Conclusions. We find the best performing package in the sense that it achieves a low FDR which is accurately estimated over the full range of p-values, albeit with a very slow run time, is the QLSpline implementation of QuasiSeq. This finding holds provided the number of biological replicates in each condition is at least 4. The next best performing packages are edgeR and DESeq2. When the number of biological replicates is sufficiently high, and within a range accessible to multiplexed experimental designs, the Polyfit extension improves the performance DESeq (for approximately 6 or more replicates per condition), making its performance comparable with that of edgeR and DESeq2 in our tests with synthetic data.",2014,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Conrad J.

fa9849db1e0df69a3405d3aab391720c87d77fbd,The Null Steady-State Distribution of the CUSUM Statistic,"We develop an empirical approximation to the null steady-state distribution of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, defined as the distribution of values obtained by running a CUSUM with no upper boundary under the null state for an indefinite period of time. The derivation is part theoretical and part empirical and the approximation is valid for CUSUMs applied to Normal data with known variance (although the theoretical result is true in general for exponential family data, which we show in the Appendix). The result leads to an easily-applied formula for steady-state p-values corresponding to CUSUM values, where the steady-state p-value is obtained as the tail area of the null steady-state distribution and represents the expected proportion of time, under repeated application of the CUSUM to null data, that the CUSUM statistic is greater than some particular value. When designing individual charts with fixed boundaries, this measure could be used alongside the average run-length (ARL) value, which we show by way of examples may be approximately related to the steady-state p-value. For multiple CUSUM schemes, use of a p-value enables application of a signalling procedure that adopts a false discovery rate (FDR) approach to multiplicity control. Under this signalling procedure, boundaries on each individual chart change at every observation according to the ordering of CUSUM values across the group of charts. We demonstrate practical application of the steady-state p-value to a single chart where the example data are number of earthquakes per year registering > 7 on the Richter scale measured from 1900 to 1998.

af5830eb32720bc09bf619a900af28bccfb7f412,Copy number variation-based genome wide association study reveals additional variants contributing to meat quality in Swine,"Pork quality is important both to the meat processing industry and consumers' purchasing attitude. Copy number variation (CNV) is a burgeoning kind of variants that may influence meat quality. In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed between CNVs and meat quality traits in swine. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, a total of 8 CNVs on 6 chromosomes were identified to be significantly associated with at least one meat quality trait. All of the 8 CNVs were verified by next generation sequencing and six of them were verified by qPCR. Only the haplotype block containing CNV12 is adjacent to significant SNPs associated with meat quality, suggesting the effects of those CNVs were not likely captured by tag SNPs. The DNA dosage and EST expression of CNV12, which overlap with an obesity related gene Netrin-1 (Ntn1), were consistent with Ntn1 RNA expression, suggesting the CNV12 might be involved in the expression regulation of Ntn1 and finally influence meat quality. We concluded that CNVs may contribute to the genetic variations of meat quality beyond SNPs, and several candidate CNVs were worth further exploration.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ligang Wang"", ids = ""30130993""); list(name = ""Lingyang Xu"", ids = ""2072646""); list(name = ""Xin Liu"", ids = ""46522521""); list(name = ""Tian Zhang"", ids = ""144978003""); list(name = ""Na Li"", ids = ""145011164""); list(name = ""El Hamidi A.

66c80770e27fc1e6ef6f37606da4f8f24c1c5d26,Molecular profiling of aromatase inhibitor-treated postmenopausal breast tumors identifies immune-related correlates of resistance.,"PURPOSE
Estrogen withdrawal by treatment with aromatase inhibitors is the most effective form of endocrine therapy for postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. However, response to therapy varies markedly and understanding of the precise molecular effects of aromatase inhibitors and causes of resistance is limited. We aimed to identify in clinical breast cancer those genes and pathways most associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitors by examining the global transcriptional effects of AI treatment.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Baseline and 2-week posttreatment biopsies were obtained from 112 postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant anastrozole. Gene expression data were obtained from 81 baseline and 2-week paired samples. Pathway analysis identified (i) the most prevalent changes in expression and (ii) the pretreatment genes/pathways most related to poor antiproliferative response.


RESULTS
A total of 1,327 genes were differentially expressed after 2-week treatment (false discovery rate < 0.01). Proliferation-associated genes and classical estrogen-dependent genes were strongly downregulated whereas collagens and chemokines were upregulated. Pretreatment expression of an inflammatory signature correlated with antiproliferative response to anastrozole and this observation was validated in an independent study. Higher expression of immune-related genes such as SLAMF8 and TNF as well as lymphocytic infiltration were associated with poorer response (P < 0.001) and validated in an independent cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
The molecular response to aromatase inhibitor treatment varies greatly between patients consistent with the variable clinical benefit from aromatase inhibitor treatment. Higher baseline expression of an inflammatory signature is associated with poor antiproliferative response and should be assessed further as a novel biomarker and potential target for aromatase inhibitor-treated patients.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anita K Dunbier"", ids = ""83359708""); list(name = ""Zara Ghazoui"", ids = ""4189337""); list(name = ""Helen Anderson"", ids = ""143778417""); list(name = ""Janine Salter"", ids = ""38385599""); list(name = ""Ashutosh Nerurkar"", ids = ""3778754""); list(name = ""Peter Osin"", ids = ""4510969""); list(name = ""Roger A'hern"", ids = ""1401473770""); list(name = ""William R Miller"", ids = ""1826817""); list(name = ""Ian E.

95d77dd4b56743e13c2ef64c0a9c0909983e7c32,Genetic variants in COMT and neurocognitive impairment in families of patients with schizophrenia.,"This study examined the relations of genetic variants in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, including rs737865 in intron 1, rs4680 in exon 4 (Val158Met) and downstream rs165599, to schizophrenia and its related neurocognitive functions in families of patients with schizophrenia. Totally, 680 individuals from 166 simplex (166 affected members and 354 nonpsychotic first-degree relatives) and 46 multiplex families (85 affected members and 75 nonpsychotic first-degree relatives) were interviewed using Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, administered Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Continuous Performance Test (CPT), and drawn for venous blood. Both categorical (dichotomizing families on affected members' neurocognitive performance) and quantitative approaches toward the WCST and CPT performance scores were employed using the family-based association test and the variance components framework, respectively. Both false discovery rate and permutations were used to adjust for multiple testing. The genotypes of rs4680 were associated with both the WCST and CPT performance scores in these families, but not with schizophrenia per se in either whole sample or subgroup analyses. Meanwhile, the other two single nucleotide polymorphisms were differentially associated with the two tasks. For WCST indexes, regardless of subgroup analyses or quantitative approach, only rs737865 exhibited moderate associations. For CPT indexes, rs737865 exhibited association for the subgroup with deficit on CPT reaction time, whereas rs165599 exhibited association for the subgroup with deficit on CPT d' as well as quantitative undegraded d'. Our results indicate that the genetic variants in COMT might be involved in modulation of neurocognitive functions and hence conferring increased risk to schizophrenia.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""S-Y Liao"", ids = ""153013419""); list(name = ""S-H Lin"", ids = ""47128173""); list(name = ""C Liu"", ids = ""123266739""); list(name = ""Ming H Hsieh"", ids = ""145525719""); list(name = ""Tzyy Jiuan Hwang"", ids = ""39009187""); list(name = ""Shi Kai Liu"", ids = ""40618736""); list(name = ""S-C Guo"", ids = ""35049095""); list(name = ""H-G Hwu"", ids = ""28138609""); list(name = ""Wei J.

e1103f498a599417f88544d943740deaf8906f35,Ranking analysis of correlation coefficients in gene expressions.,"Development of statistical methods has become very necessary for large-scale correlation analysis in the current ""omic"" data. We propose ranking analysis of correlation coefficients (RAC) based on transforming correlation matrix into correlation vector and conducting a ""locally ranking"" strategy that significantly reduces computational complexity and load. RAC gives estimation of null correlation distribution and an estimator of false discovery rate (FDR) for finding gene pairs of being correlated in expressions obtained by comparison between the ranked observed correlation coefficients and the ranked estimated ones at a given threshold level. The simulated and real data show that the estimated null correlation distribution is exactly the same with the true one and the FDR estimator works well in various scenarios. By applying our RAC, in the null dataset, no gene pairs were found but, in the human cancer dataset, 837 gene pairs were found to have positively correlated expression variations at FDRâ‰¤5%.

We measured salivary testosterone levels in 222 infants (119 males, 103 females, 108 singletons, 114 twins) between 2.70 and 4.80â€‰months of age. We tested 16 major demographic and medical history variables for effects on inter-individual variation in salivary testosterone. Using the subset of twins, we estimated genetic and environmental contributions to salivary testosterone levels. Finally, we tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within Â±5â€‰kb of genes involved in testosterone synthesis, transport, signaling, and metabolism for associations with salivary testosterone using univariate tests and random forest (RF) analysis. We report an association between 5â€‰min APGAR scores and salivary testosterone levels in males. Twin modeling indicated that individual variability in testosterone levels was primarily explained by environmental factors. Regarding genetic variation, univariate tests did not reveal any variants significantly associated with salivary testosterone after adjusting for false discovery rate. The top hit in males was rs10923844, an SNP of unknown function located downstream of HSD3B1 and HSD3B2. The top hits in females were two SNPs located upstream of ESR1 (rs3407085 and rs2295190). RF analysis, which reflects joint and conditional effects of multiple variants, indicated that genes involved in regulation of reproductive function, particularly LHCGR, are related to salivary testosterone levels in male infants, as are genes involved in cholesterol production, transport, and removal, while genes involved in estrogen signaling are related to salivary testosterone levels in female infants.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""K Xia"", ids = ""144168218""); list(name = ""Yang Yu"", ids = ""40508556""); list(name = ""Mihye Ahn"", ids = ""46686447""); list(name = ""Hongtu Zhu"", ids = ""3280236""); list(name = ""Fei Zou"", ids = ""49098245""); list(name = ""John H.

c251fcf2f8acff8a21938fc3dbae70a5cdc332f8,IL28B genotype is associated with differential expression of intrahepatic interferon-stimulated genes in patients with chronic hepatitis C.,"UNLABELLED
Genetic variation in the IL28B (interleukin 28B; interferon lambda 3) region has been associated with sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who were treated with peginterferon-Î± and ribavirin. We hypothesized that IL28B polymorphism is associated with intrahepatic expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), known to influence treatment outcome. IL28B genotyping (rs12979860) and whole-genome RNA expression were performed using liver biopsies from 61 North American patients with CHC. After correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate < 0.10), 164 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed by IL28B-type. The interferon signaling pathway was the most enriched canonical pathway differentially expressed by IL28B-type (P < 10(-5)), with most genes showing higher expression in livers of individuals carrying the poor-response IL28B-type. In 25 patients for which treatment response data were available, IL28B-type was associated with SVR (P = 0.0054). ISG expression was also associated with SVR; however, this was not independent of IL28B-type. Analysis of miR-122 expression in liver biopsies showed reduced miR-122 levels associated with poorer treatment outcome, independently of IL28B-type. No association was observed between IL28B-type and levels of liver IL28B or IL28A messenger RNA expression. IL28B protein sequence variants associated with rs12979860 were therefore investigated in vitro: no differences in ISG induction or inhibition of HCV replication were observed in Huh7.5 cells.


CONCLUSION
The good response IL28B variant was strongly associated with lower level ISG expression. The results suggest that IL28B genotype may explain the relationship between hepatic ISG expression and HCV treatment outcome, and this is independent of miR-122 expression. IL28B-type was not associated with intrahepatic IL28B messenger RNA expression in vivo. Further investigation of the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which IL28B genetic variation influences HCV outcomes is warranted.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Thomas J.

f65ddc72294e9e3d94c1936a59f17d4929549784,Serum Circulating MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Osteoporotic Fracture,"Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by increased risk of bone fracture (BF) due to fragility. BFs, particularly hip fracture, are a major concern in health care because of the associated morbidity and mortality, mainly in the elderly. Lately the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of many diseases has been recognized. In this context, the identification of microRNAs (miRNAs) specific to BF should represent a substantial step forward in diagnostics and therapeutics. The present study aimed to identify specific miRNAs in osteoporotic BF patients compared to those in osteoarthritic controls. In the profiling stage, total RNA was extracted from serum, two pools were prepared, and then retro-transcribed in triplicate. Levels of 179 serum miRNAs were analyzed by real-time PCR, and 42 of them showed significance (PÂ <Â 0.05), and 12 passed the false discovery rate test for multiple comparisons. Six miRNAs were selected for the replication stage and individually analyzed in sera from 15 BF patients and 12 controls. Results showed that 3 miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-21-5p) were valuable upregulated biomarkers in BF with respect to controls and, significantly, their levels were not affected by hemolysis. For miR-21-5p, the difference detected between groups was independent of age (PÂ =Â 0.005) and its levels correlated to those of CTx (rÂ =Â 0.76; PÂ <Â 0.00001), a marker of bone resorption.

4d9840596dd89c768cda04dd419d30097e9639b6,Regional Neocortical Gray Matter Structure and Sleep Fragmentation in Older Adults.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES
To test the hypothesis that greater sleep fragmentation is associated with regionally decreased cortical gray matter volume in older community-dwelling adults without cognitive impairment.


METHODS
We studied 141 community-dwelling older adults (median age 82.9; 73% female) without cognitive impairment or stroke, and not using sedative/ hypnotic medications, participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We quantified sleep fragmentation from 7 d of actigraphy using the metric kRA and related this to total cortical gray matter volume, and regional gray matter volume in 34 cortical regions quantified by automated segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging data. We determined statistical significance and accounted for multiple comparisons by empirically estimating the false discovery rate by permutation.


RESULTS
Lower total cortical gray matter volume was associated with higher sleep fragmentation (coefficient +0.23, standard error [SE] 0.11, P = 0.037). Lower gray matter volumes in four cortical regions were accompanied by higher sleep fragmentation with a false discovery rate < 0.05: the left (coefficient +0.36, SE 0.10, P = 2.7 Ã— 10(-4)) and right (coefficient +0.31, SE 0.10, P = 4.0 Ã— 10(-3)) lateral orbitofrontal cortices, and the adjacent left (coefficient +0.31, SE 0.10, 5.4 Ã— 10(-4)) and right (coefficient +0.39, SE 0.10, P = 1.2 Ã— 10(-4)) inferior frontal gyri pars orbitalis. These associations were unchanged after accounting for age, sex, education, depression, cognitive function, and a number of medical comorbidities.


CONCLUSIONS
Lower cortical gray matter volume in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis is associated with greater sleep fragmentation in older community-dwelling adults. Further work is needed to clarify whether this is a consequence of or contributor to sleep fragmentation.

c89eff7f329a9289a1117ea703c2e924625ba94e,Biomarker clustering to address correlations in proteomic data.,"Correlated variables have been shown to confound statistical analyses in microarray experiments. The same effect applies to an even greater degree in proteomics, especially with the use of MS for parallel measurements. Biological effects such as PTM, fragmentation, and multimer formation can produce strongly correlated variables. The problem is compounded in some types of MS by technical effects such as incomplete chromatographic separation, binding to multiple surfaces, or multiple ionizations. Existing methods for dimension reduction, notably principal components analysis and related techniques, are not always satisfactory because they produce data that often lack clear biological interpretation. We propose a preprocessing algorithm that clusters highly correlated features, using the Bayes information criterion to select an optimal number of clusters. Statistical analysis of clusters, instead of individual features, benefits from lower noise, and reduces the difficulties associated with strongly correlated data. This preprocessing increases the statistical power of analyses using false discovery rate on simulated data. Strong correlations are often present in real data, and we find that clustering improves biomarker discovery in clinical SELDI-TOF-MS datasets of plasma from patients with Kawasaki disease, and bone-marrow cell extracts from patients with acute myeloid or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Scott M.

eb082f40b1b65374a7a97c51a90c6d5c135d0814,A statistical framework for power calculations in ChIP-seq experiments,"MOTIVATION
ChIP-seq technology enables investigators to study genome-wide binding of transcription factors and mapping of epigenomic marks. Although the availability of basic analysis tools for ChIP-seq data is rapidly increasing, there has not been much progress on the related design issues. A challenging question for designing a ChIP-seq experiment is how deeply should the ChIP and the control samples be sequenced? The answer depends on multiple factors some of which can be set by the experimenter based on pilot/preliminary data. The sequencing depth of a ChIP-seq experiment is one of the key factors that determine whether all the underlying targets (e.g. binding locations or epigenomic profiles) can be identified with a targeted power.


RESULTS
We developed a statistical framework named CSSP (ChIP-seq Statistical Power) for power calculations in ChIP-seq experiments by considering a local Poisson model, which is commonly adopted by many peak callers. Evaluations with simulations and data-driven computational experiments demonstrate that this framework can reliably estimate the power of a ChIP-seq experiment at different sequencing depths based on pilot data. Furthermore, it provides an analytical approach for calculating the required depth for a targeted power while controlling the false discovery rate at a user-specified level. Hence, our results enable researchers to use their own or publicly available data for determining required sequencing depths of their ChIP-seq experiments and potentially make better use of the multiplexing functionality of the sequencers. Evaluation of power for multiple public ChIP-seq datasets indicate that, currently, typical ChIP-seq studies are powered well for detecting large fold changes of ChIP enrichment over the control sample, but they have considerably less power for detecting smaller fold changes.

b6022e3ac9c75ff6e098c574d4ee93cfd8846d4f,Combined Brain-Heart Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease Patients with Cardiac Symptoms: Hypothesis Generating Insights from a Cross-Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND
Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARDs) may affect both the heart and the brain. However, little is known about the interaction between these organs in ARD patients. We asked whether brain lesions are more frequent in ARD patients with cardiac symptoms compared with non-ARD patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).


METHODS
57 ARD patients with mean age of 48 Â± 13 years presenting with shortness of breath, chest pain, and/or palpitations, and 30 age-matched disease-controls with non-autoimmune CVD, were evaluated using combined brain-heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a 1.5T system.


RESULTS
52 (91%) ARD patients and 16 (53%) controls had white matter hyperintensities (p < 0.001) in at least one brain area (subcortical/deep/periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, pons, brainstem, or mesial temporal lobe). Only the frequency and number of subcortical and deep white matter lesions were significantly greater in ARD patients (p < 0.001 and 0.014, respectively). ARD vs. control status was the only independent predictor of having any brain lesion. Specifically for deep white matter lesions, each increase in ECV independently predicted a higher number of lesions [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.16 (1.01-1.33), p = 0.031] in ordered logistic regression. Penalized logistic regression selected only ARD vs. control status as the most important feature for predicting whether brain lesions were present on brain MRI (odds ratio: 5.46, marginal false discovery rate = 0.011).


CONCLUSIONS
Subclinical brain involvement was highly prevalent in this cohort of ARD patients and was mostly independent of the severity of cardiac involvement.

d0761f555286115a78a83675b648363e34491c11,DNA Methylation Changes in Regional Lung Macrophages Are Associated with Metabolic Differences,"A number of pulmonary diseases occur with upper lobe predominance, including cystic fibrosis and smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the healthy lung, several physiologic and metabolic factors exhibit disparity when comparing the upper lobe of the lung to lower lobe, including differences in oxygenation, ventilation, lymphatic flow, pH, and blood flow. In this study, we asked whether these regional differences in the lung are associated with DNA methylation changes in lung macrophages that could potentially lead to altered cell responsiveness upon subsequent environmental challenge. All analyses were performed using primary lung macrophages collected via bronchoalveolar lavage from healthy human subjects with normal pulmonary function. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was examined via Infinium MethylationEPIC (850K) array and validated by targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing. We observed 95 CpG loci with significant differential methylation in lung macrophages, comparing upper lobe to lower lobe (all false discovery rate < 0.05). Several of these genes, including CLIP4, HSH2D, NR4A1, SNX10, and TYK2, have been implicated as participants in inflammatory/immune-related biological processes. Functionally, we identified phenotypic differences in oxygen use, comparing upper versus lower lung macrophages. Our results support a hypothesis that epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, at a multitude of gene loci in lung macrophages are associated with metabolic differences regionally in lung.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""David A Armstrong"", ids = ""143632519""); list(name = ""Youdinghuan Chen"", ids = ""21275223""); list(name = ""John A.

The procedure tests the coding potential of conserved short genomic sequence, in which the assumptions on the probability models of gene structures are relaxed. Thus, it is expected to provide additional candidate regions that contain coding DNAs to the current genomic database. The procedure was applied to the set of highly conserved human-mouse sequences in the genome database at the University of California at Santa Cruz. For sequences containing RefSeq coding exons, the procedure detected 91.3% regions having coding potential in this set, which covers 83% of the human RefSeq coding exons, at a 2.6% false positive rate. The procedure detected 12,688 novel short regions with coding potential at the false discovery rate <0.05; 65.7% of the novel regions are between annotated genes.",2010,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jing Wu"", ids = ""47876529"")",,238f3fd46c127888f97093c1e1bdd2336f948793; 30e7e25061b7ccd9a625548dd6836afcff85043b; ebdfbd59f431f35cebeff9a232ea0b477e77fe4b; ec3fe67f7decf251866a7892c2bc5fb830e51946; 72cb97b7cf139273e3c1f55a5916c326f412775d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 34040dffc4571c90bffdae3038f9417d247f04cc; 90b6443646673862148aef380a963cd91ab96fe5; 22072ff3f609238aa2600d3868c759a7b3a9917b; 10e5f30865cd9481e7321090b395210d23c1083e; d07867ad4ffb546ca9153fe2a9728d24db46f2c0; 6af8b1efee79db7a87abc35b47bfbb7d096311d3; e037c9a793072049f669a39b9b8fdfd529848c31; af5e8fc6c7968568f7070446c058feb98796028a; 2878976835c73ed0906e17a7336b9bf10d491a1a; f63521eb2e6275d55b93db385df442b4662548f2; 69e71e169299f8e1b44ec665ba0311ae84081073; 8f699c61a94eebfd719795e8b420d05d52aa0a99; 293c49b834103cb24f9c737441c4a1cd0160feba; 09a0f235f6504461e7f522d1f5aedc92b05fe30d; 8b9cff29b49f65aa8b4b765e09eb8d6daeeee984; 8f28209660fba05a1dd882d3c2d67ef2bf232ba9; 6560cf2b5db5da265b9da3b74237806891ef48b6; bacc9fd0662ed7371fd674643723e81c76102dee; 2dbb058c8baad935f6569d2b45735dadfe2a596d; c12952d474f5db190b320404350a8bfccd13a39f; eb19613f0c868b45a7cfe601c0e85f1e79351ce0; fded6f9cefb06c1da7acddd5b9b89b1eabb08b7d; 817e86ceb5083efd8317827383e149f1dd059e35,Advances in Bioinformatics,2010,
3e188ad42919390bb892c782faba24caff582dfc,Characterizing Milk Production Related Genes in Holstein Using RNA-seq.,"Although the chemical, physical, and nutritional properties of bovine milk have been extensively studied, only a few studies have attempted to characterize milk-synthesizing genes using RNA-seq data. RNA-seq data was collected from 21 Holstein samples, along with group information about milk production ability; milk yield; and protein, fat, and solid contents. Meta-analysis was employed in order to generally characterize genes related to milk production. In addition, we attempted to investigate the relationship between milk related traits, parity, and lactation period. We observed that milk fat is highly correlated with lactation period; this result indicates that this effect should be considered in the model in order to accurately detect milk production related genes. By employing our developed model, 271 genes were significantly (false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted p-value<0.1) detected as milk production related differentially expressed genes. Of these genes, five (albumin, nitric oxide synthase 3, RNA-binding region (RNP1, RRM) containing 3, secreted and transmembrane 1, and serine palmitoyltransferase, small subunit B) were technically validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in order to check the accuracy of RNA-seq analysis. Finally, 83 gene ontology biological processes including several blood vessel and mammary gland development related terms, were significantly detected using DAVID gene-set enrichment analysis. From these results, we observed that detected milk production related genes are highly enriched in the circulation system process and mammary gland related biological functions. In addition, we observed that detected genes including caveolin 1, mammary serum amyloid A3.2, lingual antimicrobial peptide, cathelicidin 4 (CATHL4), cathelicidin 6 (CATHL6) have been reported in other species as milk production related gene. For this reason, we concluded that our detected 271 genes would be strong candidates for determining milk production.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Minseok Seo"", ids = ""35093183""); list(name = ""Hyun-Jeong Lee"", ids = ""29971156""); list(name = ""Kwondo Kim"", ids = ""3615097""); list(name = ""Kelsey Caetano-AnollÃ©s"", ids = ""1422243676""); list(name = ""Jin Young Jeong"", ids = ""4402931""); list(name = ""Sung Kwon Park"", ids = ""144948258""); list(name = ""Young Kyun Oh"", ids = ""10734525""); list(name = ""Seoae Cho"", ids = ""3010508""); list(name = ""Heebal Kim"", ids = ""2161473"")",8e606790c59b34f7458803afc8c3afbe6592ba3c; fed1f442a0906d964f2432addbc6e627b3c793f6; d5702db7e65c32a66e9a63ecdaffbfe63bf8542e; 81a3849cb73ec7a7a5ad5675c10b93dfb344401a; d4fffea24505d59f3a84262acd06bfc2f46d7bc2; f8d55afbdc13d18383a039176f415362fc2ef7a3,14435c81a2d39334ad9348575e909c5ed91e57d7; ad6c3060b250b1af676196f82b0b41cacc000c82; eb0ccfd210c2f1e99dd1eba2e98a27dcf9d1877e; efee5abc73c2b3d59d506f7ee9eb0d04bd5e5458; e99d65108768e59c24fd1de02f941b2f89466699; e1172bb4f4ff2e3c25fda2e0a1b4be611c7d000d; 601ac552015a3138eac85270661669b52a86e657; 5b6b9ce0b428f1688b31766fa32aa73214626213; 74cc8e5191bd956d1eb256077d5571e9288d9f09; 22bb95b82718b9c25639c1d04dff37b8cf11f637; 0dcd6a242e90fe50c1f43510deb149cf0add16c6; 83914a6ae6c46f14b87a3ee596061251b56d8b40; bc0b18e4278e03f4a9c71f3fdb7bf0a3cf639759; 195c15e26421026bc1243faabe6fa695aa713684; a91df562dd2919ef9390b9567968f5aa687f95c1,Asian-Australasian journal of animal sciences,29 3,"

128944f5e66f2a78d7e7aed775d0d9b3f75b5161,Single-Feature Polymorphism Discovery in the Transcriptome of Tetraploid Alfalfa,"Advances in alfalfa [Medicago sativa (L.) subsp. sativa] breeding, molecular genetics, and genomics have been slow because this crop is an allogamous autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) with complex polysomic inheritance and few genomic resources. Increasing cellulose and decreasing lignin in alfalfa stem cell walls would improve this crop as a cellulosic ethanol feedstock. We conducted genome-wide analysis of single-feature polymorphisms (SFPs) of two alfalfa genotypes (252, 1283) that differ in stem cell wall lignin and cellulose concentrations. SFP analysis was conducted using the Medicago GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as a crossspecies platform. Analysis of GeneChip expression data fi les of alfalfa stem internodes of genotypes 252 and 1283 at two growth stages (elongating, post-elongation) revealed 10,890 SFPs in 8230 probe sets. Validation analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequencing of a random sample of SFPs indicated a 17% false discovery rate. Functional classifi cation and over-representation analysis showed that genes involved in photosynthesis, stress response and cell wall biosynthesis were highly enriched among SFP-harboring genes.

ef97945a23c6d676a12f4ba700ab27c23d10a221,Epigenome-wide DNA Methylation Association Analysis Identified Novel Loci in Peripheral Cells for Alcohol Consumption among European American Male Veterans.,"BACKGROUND
Hazardous alcohol consumption has significant adverse medical consequences. These effects may be mediated, in part, by alterations in DNA methylation. Thus, DNA methylation signatures in peripheral cells may provide biomarkers of the medical impact of alcohol use and the risk for future alcohol consumption.


METHOD
Using a high density methylation array, we characterized epigenome-wide DNA methylation in saliva cells with respect to alcohol consumption in a large cohort of male European American veterans. In this study, DNA methylation of over 870,000 CpG DNA sites was profiled in 1,135 European American men. Alcohol consumption was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C). Linear regression was applied in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), adjusted for confounders. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed in the KEGG database with a correction for gene length.


RESULTS
We found that a total of 70 CpG sites reached EWAS-corrected significance (p<6E-08) with small effects on alcohol consumption for individual CpG sites, including 64 new CpG sites and six CpG sites that were previously reported as associated with alcohol use disorder, liver function, body mass index, and lipid metabolism. The most significant CpG site was located in SLC7A11(t=-11.34, p=2.66E-28), a gene involved specifically in cysteine and glutamate transportation. The 70 significant CpG sites were located on 44 genes, including genes involved in amino acid transport and metabolism systems. We identified 68 pathways with a false discovery rate <0.05.


CONCLUSION
We identified novel DNA methylation sites associated with alcohol consumption. Results may shed light on peripheral mechanisms of alcohol consumption on adverse health outcomes among heavy drinkers.

b299463a5d3669659e4f56e18880fd94c78c725b,Gene Expression Profiling in Human Lung Cells Exposed to Isoprene-Derived Secondary Organic Aerosol.,"Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from the photochemical oxidation of isoprene contributes a substantial mass fraction to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The formation of isoprene SOA is influenced largely by anthropogenic emissions through multiphase chemistry of its multigenerational oxidation products. Considering the abundance of isoprene SOA in the troposphere, understanding mechanisms of adverse health effects through inhalation exposure is critical to mitigating its potential impact on public health. In this study, we assessed the effects of isoprene SOA on gene expression in human airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) through an air-liquid interface exposure. Gene expression profiling of 84 oxidative stress and 249 inflammation-associated human genes was performed. Our results show that the expression levels of 29 genes were significantly altered upon isoprene SOA exposure under noncytotoxic conditions (p < 0.05), with the majority (22/29) of genes passing a false discovery rate threshold of 0.3. The most significantly affected genes belong to the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor network. The Nrf2 function is confirmed through a reporter cell line. Together with detailed characterization of SOA constituents, this study reveals the impact of isoprene SOA exposure on lung responses and highlights the importance of further understanding its potential health outcomes.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ying-Hsuan Lin"", ids = ""4873270""); list(name = ""Maiko Arashiro"", ids = ""40562652""); list(name = ""Phillip W Clapp"", ids = ""48309342""); list(name = ""Tianqu Cui"", ids = ""6356079""); list(name = ""Kenneth G.

6cd1f70956a8efb629d4c0f08edbe53e218c282c,Associations between functional polymorphisms and response to biological treatment in Danish patients with psoriasis,"Biological agents including anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF; adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept) and anti-interleukin-12/13 (IL12/23; ustekinumab) are essential for treatment of patients with severe psoriasis. However, a significant proportion of the patients do not respond to a specific treatment. Pharmacogenetics might be a way to predict treatment response. Using a candidate gene approach, 62 mainly functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 44 different genes were evaluated in 478 Danish patients with psoriasis undergoing 376 series of anti-TNF treatment and 230 series of ustekinumab treatment. Associations between genetic variants and treatment outcomes (drug survival and Psoriasis Area Severity Index reduction) were assessed using logistic regression analyses (crude and adjusted for gender, age, psoriatic arthritis and previous treatment). After correction for multiple testing controlling the false discovery rate, six SNPs (IL1B (rs1143623, rs1143627), LY96 (rs11465996), TLR2 (rs11938228, rs4696480) and TLR9 (rs352139)) were associated with response to anti-TNF treatment and 4 SNPs (IL1B (rs1143623, rs1143627), TIRAP (rs8177374) and TLR5 (rs5744174)) were associated with response to ustekinumab treatment (q<0.20). The results suggest that genetic variants related to increased IL-1Î² levels may be unfavorable when treating psoriasis with either anti-TNF or ustekinumab, whereas genetic variants related to high interferon-Î³ levels may be favorable when treating psoriasis with ustekinumab.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nikolai Dyrberg Loft"", ids = ""7433565""); list(name = ""Lone Skov"", ids = ""39141990""); list(name = ""Lars Iversen"", ids = ""20091299""); list(name = ""Robert Gniadecki"", ids = ""49153294""); list(name = ""Tomas Norman Dam"", ids = ""152120447""); list(name = ""Ivan Brandslund"", ids = ""49426437""); list(name = ""Hans JÃ¼rgen Hoffmann"", ids = ""145961419""); list(name = ""Malene Rask Andersen"", ids = ""78555886""); list(name = ""Ram Benny Dessau"", ids = ""3346502""); list(name = ""Antje Bergmann"", ids = ""51332808""); list(name = ""Niels MÃ¸ller Andersen"", ids = ""39514741""); list(name = ""Paal Skytt Andersen"", ids = ""1849071""); list(name = ""Steffen Bank"", ids = ""33601752""); list(name = ""Ulla Vogel"", ids = ""153197077""); list(name = ""Vibeke Harms Andersen"", ids = ""11927344"")",5937950c87e3dd293d785a7445603907116f46d9; 4f052f670b3694d0d96ce6cc769db8863713a831; 2ac9ee40cf5574699a18d6ac0cf84b5b5911e16d; cd9070ac05d984cb37bfdb5e96bfa63f503a4138; f6d93323544ccf322c5b5e56b91b9bda533225a0; 9a1f980cff6ebafd17cdbed866d91ed571de8ba9; 2a6e37422a71c2d9b7101f0585ce35b9dc1a3fd0; 4f96b6e2a156cef242ee815a0af5a9ee9830cd3c; 099ac25552ec8792eed20cca411763a098e1249c; d52ff1712269c77be7f9a52599e5d035c808c7e8,dcb5659445586df7951d3b6f4d7882f146ef59b0; 984c73e2f402468eb4c583015d07eeac363a8698; 824166d7853a95d370eb6b4ff7d419bf4a8aabd2; 8da971bbfab8bfc36fad2a357d117765219d0f64; dc52ecd32c0f825ee73d359b9f5c1cac31e8b0ab; 7904193b0eac7d9e67c810f0789b7a1faf78cc77; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 60cb12e499080a865fac5052f2d71362c8e3b3d5; 716756260fb2935b1a09731c24d4f7d2ba517052; 6bbdf8509d5e3053659a4821813fbc1f215a9717; a0c85549ec703a65da4b20a05a9f3743b269c5bf; 5012ca387b2b4beaa4eacd10ca73f02c34b4fd5e; 27737bf63db0aa36488b69446117a76e687e1808; 0c4a964b5e7dcd66d03baa45f41cf1d1dbe53242; 94117b938ffd3353de5f599b8d33ca864debc3b6; 4f7c819cf131c495ccb8d8a887c1b4cfdeded639; 54b264f5fe55846c88d534e3bd82191e3bab6aaf; f6adffd659daa3706a1e5a6811e85d99f61605f1; 887ebf41c3d1bc2a5c99b65fefb58618e0ae85cf; 7eb47e871809a7dcde90450d336319c26e26559e; a5d1b51dadcb7ea8d417d77edc093e9df60a5633; d912344ba6030c3f695984748c7ffdca76719eb1; 46a2509d5209014f63f076652a0a96400dcf4925; 3b59d50188bb543023e93ee6509808336e0cfd20; de24a9200f5381b3fecca22dc4a0c94ac564c440; 459691ce3885555d1cef3545ec8746a7a9d5fce7; 236bcab377f3824bcfb7c6dfedbd7d69d4488f47; 60bf2f726931cf44ac30702b7c15437e2521f016; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; 5f895b78432f3c9f579ef8ff394911f2dd2be0aa; 650a844b27ec849570764def846e68dcb03bd2ea; 77e8202d9371dd9dd7beef40d862fd5e329a5bcd; 9b5f94d19135f6ce6e2d73e3f35e66fffd483b42; 15908945ee39302ebcfe8d8e7e047df69a700e43; 2e9a742ae7f48b4f3158c44fb1ccd77f5d87db09; de8678c69532509442f230a43bff5883cb7007a3; f7d5b3375ee819fed2f58f1a35e11554c67d0598; 454624e722306b0aec28616618384c7b11797773; 29c0a64c08ee7444f00a6013a5eb2d2b45026084; db50b5b1b69823de14ea68f4f1169a93e3d66682; 82d02c40fc4b1a65ff5cd9670f9a62f168966b62; 009d84ed6943860e917d70e03080624044444fbe; 12119b1474e585d5e5d2f9f00ae7f908191c905e; ed9518036c5ca24e4bb86b94cc9a78250402c705; 90a52536c3c2fa30bfe021d43881a8630274bfa3; cbd005571ca0fdc8d8fcd6bf1f53c1a6835b2cf1; e4cfc4e8cd088d704234929ef7f871d52df453aa; 9ee1e9ea9eb5346a2be3d8fec8ecaa8b3c8d23ab; a5c9c079fbdd7001d92462c7ee27e06a04e1eae2; 2a7ce2c532eb8c04e8ad12cdeedb739dca010142; 593cc3dc914dab189435f72fbffc154303d180cc; 85bcb376e56a460028e2cb713c076387bf837fd1,The Pharmacogenomics Journal,18,494-500
28087496d717dbb708af1bccc165ff6e60a68f70,Application of the false discovery rate to quantitative trait loci interval mapping with multiple traits.,"Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) has been proposed as an alternative to controlling the genome-wise error rate (GWER) for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) in genome scans. The objective here was to implement FDR in the context of regression interval mapping for multiple traits. Data on five traits from an F2 swine breed cross were used. FDR was implemented using tests at every 1 cM (FDR1) and using tests with the highest test statistic for each marker interval (FDRm). For the latter, a method was developed to predict comparison-wise error rates. At low error rates, FDR1 behaved erratically; FDRm was more stable but gave similar significance thresholds and number of QTL detected. At the same error rate, methods to control FDR gave less stringent significance thresholds and more QTL detected than methods to control GWER. Although testing across traits had limited impact on FDR, single-trait testing was recommended because there is no theoretical reason to pool tests across traits for FDR. FDR based on FDRm was recommended for QTL detection in interval mapping because it provides significance tests that are meaningful, yet not overly stringent, such that a more complete picture of QTL is revealed.",2002,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hakkyo K.

acdf3ac7a07166bdeca0f4ba6f8b3d27f6dc284c,Protective pathways against colitis mediated by appendicitis and appendectomy.,"Appendicitis followed by appendectomy (AA) at a young age protects against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using a novel murine appendicitis model, we showed that AA protected against subsequent experimental colitis. To delineate genes/pathways involved in this protection, AA was performed and samples harvested from the most distal colon. RNA was extracted from four individual colonic samples per group (AA group and double-laparotomy control group) and each sample microarray analysed followed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The gene-expression study was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of 14 selected genes across the immunological spectrum. Distal colonic expression of 266 gene-sets was up-regulated significantly in AA group samples (false discovery rates < 1%; P-value < 0Â·001). Time-course RT-PCR experiments involving the 14 genes displayed down-regulation over 28 days. The IBD-associated genes tnfsf10, SLC22A5, C3, ccr5, irgm, ptger4 and ccl20 were modulated in AA mice 3 days after surgery. Many key immunological and cellular function-associated gene-sets involved in the protective effect of AA in experimental colitis were identified. The down-regulation of 14 selected genes over 28 days after surgery indicates activation, repression or de-repression of these genes leading to downstream AA-conferred anti-colitis protection. Further analysis of these genes, profiles and biological pathways may assist in developing better therapeutic strategies in the management of intractable IBD.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rajkumar Cheluvappa"", ids = ""4449185""); list(name = ""Annie S Luo"", ids = ""13005359""); list(name = ""C.

Studies of immunopathogenesis in hamster infection models are challenging because of the limited availability of reagents needed to define cellular and molecular determinants.ResultsWe sequenced a hamster cDNA library and developed a first-generation custom cDNA microarray that included 5131 unique cDNAs enriched for immune response genes. We used this microarray to interrogate the hamster spleen response to Leishmania donovani, an intracellular protozoan that causes visceral leishmaniasis. The hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis is of particular interest because it recapitulates clinical and immunopathological features of human disease, including cachexia, massive splenomegaly, pancytopenia, immunosuppression, and ultimately death. In the microarray a differentially expressed transcript was identified as having at least a 2-fold change in expression between uninfected and infected groups and a False Discovery Rate of <5%. Following a relatively silent early phase of infection (at 7 and 14 days post-infection only 8 and 24 genes, respectively, were differentially expressed), there was dramatic upregulation of inflammatory and immune-related genes in the spleen (708 differentially expressed genes were evident at 28 days post-infection). The differentially expressed transcripts included genes involved in inflammation, immunity, and immune cell trafficking. Of particular interest there was concomitant upregulation of the IFN-Î³ and interleukin (IL)-4 signaling pathways, with increased expression of a battery of IFN-Î³- and IL-4-responsive genes. The latter included genes characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages.ConclusionsTranscriptional profiling was accomplished in the Syrian golden hamster, for which a fully annotated genome is not available. In the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis, a robust and functional IFN-Î³ response did not restrain parasite load and progression of disease. This supports the accumulating evidence that macrophages are ineffectively activated to kill the parasite. The concomitant expression of IL-4/IL-13 and their downstream target genes, some of which were characteristic of alternative macrophage activation, are likely to contribute to this. Further dissection of mechanisms that lead to polarization of macrophages toward a permissive state is needed to fully understand the pathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Claudia M.

The purpose of the present study was to test the developmental origins of some of these associations in a large longitudinal sample of children.MethodsFor 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes reported to be associated with BMI in adults, we examined associations with BMI in a sample of 5000 children (2500 twin pairs) with BMI data at 4, 7 and 10 years. Association analyses were performed using the Quantitative Transmission Disequilibrium Test and we corrected for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate.ResultsDespite having 80% power to detect associations that account for as little as 0.2% of the variance of BMI, none of the 10 SNPs were significantly associated with BMI at any age, although two SNPs showed trends in the expected direction.ConclusionThe lack of association for these ten previously reported associations, despite our large sample size, is typical of associations between candidate genes and complex traits. However, some of the reported SNP associations with BMI might emerge as we continue to follow the sample into adolescence and adulthood.

5e7f473f7dbd666ba36751202c2489b30b441e57,Performance of compressed sensing for fluorine-19 magnetic resonance imaging at low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.,"PURPOSE
To examine the performance of compressed sensing (CS) in reconstructing low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 19 F MR signals that are close to the detection threshold and originate from small signal sources with no a priori known location.


METHODS
Regularization strength was adjusted automatically based on noise level. As performance metrics, root-mean-square deviations, true positive rates (TPRs), and false discovery rates were computed. CS and conventional reconstructions were compared at equal measurement time and evaluated in relation to high-SNR reference data. 19 F MR data were generated from a purpose-built phantom and benchmarked against simulations, as well as from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model. We quantified the signal intensity bias and introduced an intensity calibration for in vivo data using high-SNR ex vivo data.


RESULTS
Low-SNR 19 F MR data could be reliably reconstructed. Detection sensitivity was consistently improved and data fidelity was preserved for undersampling and averaging factors of Î± = 2 or = 3. Higher Î± led to signal blurring in the mouse model. The improved TPRs at Î± = 3 were comparable to a 2.5-fold increase in measurement time. Whereas CS resulted in a downward bias of the 19 F MR signal, Fourier reconstructions resulted in an unexpected upward bias of similar magnitude. The calibration corrected signal-intensity deviations for all reconstructions.


CONCLUSION
CS is advantageous whenever image features are close to the detection threshold. It is a powerful tool, even for low-SNR data with sparsely distributed 19 F signals, to improve spatial and temporal resolution in 19 F MR applications.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ludger Starke"", ids = ""23620606""); list(name = ""Andreas Pohlmann"", ids = ""3140196""); list(name = ""Christian Prinz"", ids = ""48535809""); list(name = ""Thoralf Niendorf"", ids = ""48964846""); list(name = ""Sonia Waiczies"", ids = ""5224029"")",,c08b77bb26f7958125d2aa867ccf667ab2db7f40; 91bf9dca5d10430f0cf3b138153d316540e9c89c; 9e493af59a113c74f1b486b2c709af28116e9e4d; e404c06ae3e1c948513e13d556d7dcfceedc7eb4; c7087fa791954c35e0e6886c672d240b640e7c73; a6484ed2d7c9f5b249c17934dce43b4bbb402dfa; 058fcce06326264d6e7a649e04a3fb10e93d47dd; f6f7c62b8aadd842f8cc4f87391c8c99c48d9176; c22a19d8541ff71927a9b63f0ef8dee193ab7c2d; e2b11b85f6fdfce63a86a9e40b84242012a06a9d; 54205667c1f65a320f667d73c354ed8e86f1b9d9; 6b893efb71a777157d6562ef7fca03cf887694ba; c795a295222bb65cdc3474b48a4350fe2224a09e; 3fd09d8b87adb4019ecfb045f25893c4618c4178; f5625ed9174726035298da5974371e5e48f7d7fd; bd2d7785b96f87f11fff128ce87dd439fbea8657; 795222de1b5dc93837d2ea9ea68a26027ac57f12; 6ee64a62bb97da030b971720a2fe438018f1676a; deeba92587877c4f41a729c541b84472e4cd7dd1; 3d628f681e7b827d729c54a1fe1449afbc9a4808; 83d9b4efff777bca37e1d3ac02659f8d23cf5972; 1c8fafa88ff7d12b881440f316b67af71c912adf; 3bb9d301d4489a57b4647a03a2909e6d11fcd13c; 8190477d4de5f393381200af1f583909d2fca3ac; cd8d5dd99e3ebf242f369f30b12a74e6676609d3; 9fb8c76e6b17f3fdbd0c8f293ce8da4b79f4ffeb; 6a0d91340857429311d31f7e870745070328dc1b; 05d24ed829c029a67996eba71d221322aa34015c; b06762c93844f4375efc49de7a5a9735a5bb8859; 8495e6606132c211cdf566f597a3e7f9708de812; fb1bd39ab7db4f9319405cee0eec6bf66fd87794; f4b03b8f6c99992e0bcfdaff745971d6880486d0; 20287d3e224fea314ecb855238ece6677c216a1b; 0b70cadb10921d1d288226e33b2a522fcd64b7ef; 7b9958c8645e071c9de7bf525cd6736bd3e98224; 43d2083c4d24d9bd2f49edf7a478cdbfd79b315e; 6952b559e627129b4925af814c504b23e872a6b4; d785b4b6a2db9d0433926e446c579af3e0caeb6b; 8aa2994ccbc89b1e806c5ae9389ede13b7ab8971; d8d52fd3ae4a907aacc481a0fd344ca7dd9587f4; ea1c46734d3bd3ffa6587e27c86b305882b12607; 59e9eeeb890d50f97bc131d94614ca6a3aae3b25; 05e5dd62135e8e1feb73b3aed773fd55d0c59212; b6f4fec69fcdde748a39821f13fcb538b6530de9; 5e5f7b03044a218fcdf3c1e75a19cee9c0ad47b1; ec6271dd0df8e9d22aaa96a0f6ec7482836786f2; b1dc0fa0edd9ccf77f6a3df48833f6e48fc40068; 98608aaedbb45d229b79ed1a3ddbdb0ceb745967; e830a4f7186b8855147992f19b8864d7cccebe4a,Magnetic resonance in medicine,,
ce523975b36c872e5f171109d8088a8659b3b710,A New Method to Reconstruct Recombination Events at a Genomic Scale,"Recombination is one of the main forces shaping genome diversity, but the information it generates is often overlooked. A recombination event creates a junction between two parental sequences that may be transmitted to the subsequent generations. Just like mutations, these junctions carry evidence of the shared past of the sequences. We present the IRiS algorithm, which detects past recombination events from extant sequences and specifies the place of each recombination and which are the recombinants sequences. We have validated and calibrated IRiS for the human genome using coalescent simulations replicating standard human demographic history and a variable recombination rate model, and we have fine-tuned IRiS parameters to simultaneously optimize for false discovery rate, sensitivity, and accuracy in placing the recombination events in the sequence. Newer recombinations overwrite traces of past ones and our results indicate more recent recombinations are detected by IRiS with greater sensitivity. IRiS analysis of the MS32 region, previously studied using sperm typing, showed good concordance with estimated recombination rates. We also applied IRiS to haplotypes for 18 X-chromosome regions in HapMap Phase 3 populations. Recombination events detected for each individual were recoded as binary allelic states and combined into recotypes. Principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling based on recotypes reproduced the relationships between the eleven HapMap Phase III populations that can be expected from known human population history, thus further validating IRiS.

Although underlying mechanisms are unknown, human biomonitoring studies indicate increased genetic damage (e.g. chromosomal aberrations) with pesticide exposure. Given that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway repairs a broad range of DNA damage, we evaluated interactions between pesticide exposure and 324 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 27 NER genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1444 male controls in a nested case-control study of white Agricultural Health Study pesticide applicators. We determined interaction P values using likelihood ratio tests from logistic regression models and three-level pesticide variables (none/low/high) based on lifetime days of use weighted to an intensity score. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Of the 17 interactions that met FDR <0.2, 3 displayed a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk with increasing exposure in one genotype group and no significant association in the other group. Men carrying the variant A allele at ERCC1 rs2298881 exhibited increased prostate cancer risk with high versus no fonofos use [odds ratio (OR) 2.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-5.39; P(interact) = 3.6 Ã— 10(-4); FDR-adjusted P = 0.11]. Men carrying the homozygous wild-type TT genotype at two correlated CDK7 SNPs, rs11744596 and rs2932778 (r(2) = 1.0), exhibited increased risk with high versus no carbofuran use (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.31-3.10 for rs11744596; P(interact) = 7.2 Ã— 10(-4); FDR-adjusted P = 0.09). In contrast, we did not observe associations among men with other genotypes at these loci. While requiring replication, our findings suggest a role for NER genetic variation in pesticide-associated prostate cancer risk.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kathryn Hughes Barry"", ids = ""6142406""); list(name = ""Stella Koutros"", ids = ""3662087""); list(name = ""Gabriella Andreotti"", ids = ""3003370""); list(name = ""Dale P Sandler"", ids = ""2470346""); list(name = ""Laurie A.

The aim of this study was to compare the ipsi- v. contralateral horns in terms of (1) endometrial gene expression and (2) the ability to support conceptus growth to Day 14. In Experiment 1, endometrial samples from the ipsi- and contralateral horns were collected from synchronized nonpregnant heifers slaughtered on Day 5, 7, 13 or 16 post-oestrus (n=5 per time point) and snap frozen for subsequent analysis. In Experiment 2, fresh Day 7in vitro-produced blastocysts were transferred to the uterine horn(s) ipsilateral (Group I, n=9 recipients) or contralateral to the CL (Group C, n=8) or to both horns (i.e. bilateral, Group B, n=9) of synchronized recipients (10 embryos transferred per horn per recipient). All recipients were slaughtered on Day 14. Reproductive tracts were recovered and each horn was flushed independently. The number and dimensions (length and width) of recovered conceptuses were recorded independently for each horn. Embryo data were analysed using PROC MIXED in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The model had treatment as a fixed effect and heifer within treatment as a random effect. Experiment 1, RNA-Seq analysis of endometrium, detected 217, 54, 14, and 18 differentially expressed genes (>2-fold change, false discovery rate P<0.05) between ipsi- and contralateral horns on Day 5, 7, 13, and 16 of the oestrous cycle, respectively. In Experiment 2, no differences were observed in the recovery rate of conceptuses on Day 14 from the 3 groups [53.3% (48/90), 48.7% (39/80), and 45% (81/180)], for the I, C, and B transfer groups, respectively. Conceptus length from the ipsi- (2.24Â±0.35mm) and contralateral (2.91Â±0.38mm) horns was not different (P>0.05). Thus, significant differences in endometrial gene expression exist between the uterine horns ipsi- and contralateral to the CL in cattle, but those differences do not affect conceptus elongation on Day 14.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""J.

7d2582825898ddce7022685e1139e1556edcf7a3,Genetic polymorphisms associated with increased risk of developing chronic myelogenous leukemia,"Little is known about inherited factors associated with the risk of developing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We used a dedicated DNA chip containing 16 561 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 1 916 candidate genes to analyze 437 CML patients and 1 144 healthy control individuals. Single SNP association analysis identified 139 SNPs that passed multiple comparisons (1% false discovery rate). The HDAC9, AVEN, SEMA3C, IKBKB, GSTA3, RIPK1 and FGF2 genes were each represented by three SNPs, the PSM family by four SNPs and the SLC15A1 gene by six. Haplotype analysis showed that certain combinations of rare alleles of these genes increased the risk of developing CML by more than two or three-fold. A classification tree model identified five SNPs belonging to the genes PSMB10, TNFRSF10D, PSMB2, PPARD and CYP26B1, which were associated with CML predisposition. A CML-risk-allele score was created using these five SNPs. This score was accurate for discriminating CML status (AUC: 0.61, 95%CI: 0.58-0.64). Interestingly, the score was associated with age at diagnosis and the average number of risk alleles was significantly higher in younger patients. The risk-allele score showed the same distribution in the general population (HapMap CEU samples) as in our control individuals and was associated with differential gene expression patterns of two genes (VAPA and TDRKH).

The objective of this study was to detect genomic regions associated with four fertility parameters: days at first service (D1S), calving interval (CI) number of services per conception (NSC) and days open (OD) to provide tools for improvement of the selection process. Phenotypes were the breeding values of D1S, CI, NSC and OD with reliabilities greater than 0.30 of Mexican Holstein females born from 2008 to 2013. After the genotypeâ€™s quality control, a total of 20,407 SNP and 3,242 animals were used to perform Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) through a single linear regression model, previously adjusting for population composition and counting for false discovery rate and Bonferroniâ€™s correction. Quality control and GWAS were performed with SVS Golden Helix V.8.6. Hundreds of significant SNP (<1*e-5) were associated to fertility traits in the Mexican Holstein population. Because several genomic regions were related with many traits, the 100 most significant SNPs for each trait were pooled together and the SNP associated with more than two traits were referenced in the genomic databases. Six of the nine SNP associated in this study with more than two traits, were previously reported in other populations. Three of them are related directly with fertility (The SNP ARS-BFGL-NGS101016 with calving index and calving ease, Hapmap31053-BTA-111664 with number of inseminations and non-return rate and ARS-BFGL-NGS-103755 with calf size). Another three SNP have not been linked to fertility, but instead are related with traits for which a negative relationship with it has been reported like some production traits (for example, the marker ARS-BFGL-NGS-24522, SNP is related with caseins yield, BTB-01869907 with milk, fat, protein and lactose yield and Hapmap44709-BTA-70915 with mature weight). Markers BTB-02009158, ARS-BFGL-NGS-115837 and ARS-BFGL-NGS-113691 from chromosomes 8, 14 and 22 respectively, have not been previously associated to traits or genes that explain a possible interaction with fertility.

ca17d84eaddab0e848cce4fa659611a9fb8f646f,Regional variations in adverse event reporting rates and ACR responses in placebo/standard-of-care arms of rheumatoid arthritis trials.,"OBJECTIVE
Clinical trials are increasingly globalized, and adverse event (AE) rates and treatment responses may differ by geographical region. This study assessed regional differences in AE reporting rates and ACR response rates (ACR20/50) in patients with RA who received placebo/standard-of-care treatment in clinical trials.


METHODS
Patients from the placebo arms of 7 RA trials in the TransCelerate Biopharma Inc database were grouped into 5 geographical regions (Asia, Latin America, Russian Federation and Eastern Europe [RFEE], USA, and Western Europe). Differences in demographics, AE reporting rates and ACR response were evaluated using descriptive statistics and omnibus tests for significance; pairwise comparisons were made between regions, with false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Among 970 patients included, week 12 AE rates were significantly lower in the RFEE than in Asia, Latin America and the USA (22% vs 51%, 49% and 53%, respectively; P < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction). Similar differences in AE rates across geographical regions were seen at week 52. Among 747 patients with ACR data, the lowest response rates were observed in the USA (ACR20, 22%) and RFEE (ACR50, 3%); the highest response rates were seen in Western Europe (ACR20, 43%) and Latin America (ACR50, 15%). Only the differences in ACR50 response between the RFEE and Latin America remained significant after false discovery rate correction.


CONCLUSION
These placebo/standard-of-care arm data revealed significant regional differences in AE reporting rates and ACR50 response rates. Regional distribution of patients should be considered when conducting RA clinical trials, particularly during recruitment.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Daniel W.

3c5fd2921a1fa4b475f66fbec1e6bb58b1808bd8,Compositional knockoff filter for high-dimensional regression analysis of microbiome data,"A critical task in microbiome data analysis is to explore the association between a scalar response of interest and a large number of microbial taxa that are summarized as compositional data at different taxonomic levels. Motivated by fine-mapping of the microbiome, we propose a two-step compositional knockoff filter (CKF) to provide the effective finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control in high-dimensional linear log-contrast regression analysis of microbiome compositional data. In the first step, we employ the compositional screening procedure to remove insignificant microbial taxa while retaining the essential sum-to-zero constraint. In the second step, we extend the knockoff filter to identify the significant microbial taxa in the sparse regression model for compositional data. Thereby, a subset of the microbes is selected from the high-dimensional microbial taxa as related to the response using a pre-specified FDR threshold. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed two-step procedure, including both sure screening and effective false discovery control. We demonstrate the finite-sample properties in simulation studies, which show the gain in the empirical power while controlling the nominal FDR. The potential usefulness of the proposed method is also illustrated with application to an inflammatory bowel disease dataset to identify microbial taxa that influence host gene expressions.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Arun Srinivasan"", ids = ""153232804""); list(name = ""Lingzhou Xue"", ids = ""143732623""); list(name = ""Xiang Zhan"", ids = ""48550761"")",,08c7ebde2c2bbb53093d7c5a456424443cb54b7d; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; a6e0739455352b0be05e22548bff81f5b1f80788; d5bc0229dd8f453dd1b8e1b97cbd61d64528033d; c673b27e713ccf25a2716bd650be682c2e6fd250; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 2704db65f5396b65ea4796ef0a14f98603442675; 75b8cb1c98ddbd4db78e85becb8d2420b846deaf; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; e78048f7267cb2af077ca9d5a8d77734039ba82e; 132daa9be756ce5ac7caa4d43847f63bc36d2124; a4c19d7aff042ad67ab054dc35b23903ad6419d4; 42d7b24cded000a9b042ae48d2386d26a27724fb; 04eb70a9f832a9879841135bf051c8b1ec9d3010; 0e377bed365a2d49ebc2154956bfd0759b3760e2; 1c2157c4c982ae037f228deb2b3cacd7c2f6f38c; d7922e5a385fb6c44dc60de3ea33d95fbec24a5d; 4bdc1e26e028ac204730dcbe24c15f7d0878be77; 220ee8bb342033f06f768279ec54347492332c49; 7c316f6630e52fe5bfc027ea1795339035f6ab3f; afa65a3c7d08ba31ee00c576c3b36456ffaf735e; d46f5c8d7dfadf3093e017a9019034d0a0a39a50; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; d381f4cbbe79b3f80a8261ecf8407b85712c6419; b428e2f5739c8efac75c465fa6df7aec844bb1e7; 20efb18888bb9142eaf7543946c2045203b4415a; 649f39d6605da399bbba133b69bfc53543e456a1; 3a2cbfaf7854379af2f38a103af815a465e3b1f9; c0e691074e12483027aab2b25a0e41022d8d4abf; d8b306477e7b00a3dc7d71bf0a329f03a9497ae9; 7335660e55f5537dcb09ca29e689211dacffe40e; fc1d0dc34f512f1cf0654207e3ec120c2f4806a1; 87c78dca074fabb021cf921d3a228b65dac8e3d3; d13f2e719d13a5de82ae30d59056a0f13092b776; 2a18eef255784593f4bd7aa34d81843efaa6656b; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 3c17fd1a305ad585fbadb52cf06e114af50be59a; 458dbdfa7ad609b8dfda40d8603fb77f6b4fc53d; f93cbb26b36c0d0b7190a15bdd13bebcce2e1bdc; b2adb4a13c760a72d9d2524a1fdedfd2b91aa390; 3cd8314bb4b869b5d6667cfcb236691a955e7ac0; 6b5eafe3e33cf9548bb410dbc264fd8d1c7efeec; 5ddca1268034d1a2295083c6e00bd224af197496,bioRxiv,,
3564f17d529d0acdca6a3e75bea4fa5fe3ff6a37,"Simultaneous high-probability bounds on the false discovery proportion in structured, regression, and online settings","While traditional multiple testing procedures prohibit adaptive analysis choices made by users, Goeman and Solari (2011) proposed a simultaneous inference framework that allows users such flexibility while preserving high-probability bounds on the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the chosen set. In this paper, we propose a new class of such simultaneous FDP bounds, tailored for nested sequences of rejection sets. While most existing simultaneous FDP bounds are based on closed testing using global null tests based on sorted p-values, we additionally consider the setting where side information can be leveraged to boost power, the variable selection setting where knockoff statistics can be used to order variables, and the online setting where decisions about rejections must be made as data arrives. Our finite-sample, closed form bounds are based on repurposing the FDP estimates from false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures designed for each of the above settings. These results establish a novel connection between the parallel literatures of simultaneous FDP bounds and FDR control methods, and use proof techniques employing martingales and filtrations that are new to both these literatures.

In the modern world, morality is considered as the social capital, which determines a level of society well-being. Participants were showed 24 moral dilemma and 24 control task vignettes represented artist-sketched cartoons of control and dilemma scenarios. For all participants and every experimental condition, the model of localization equivalent dipoles electroenÃ¦phalogram (EEG) components was made. Individual localization of EEG electrodes was matched with a model of localization of electrodes of head, which was used for determining the equivalent dipoles. Event-related spectral perturbations were calculated to estimate induced responses via the EEGLAB toolbox. The dataset was prepared for clustering by the original PCA method. The correction for multiple comparisons was made by the False Discovery Rate method. To determine the correlations cortical sources of EEG activity with Social Intellect, sLORETA was applied to the data. Differences between moral dilemmas and control tasks without moral choice were found in delta, theta, alpha and beta diapasons in clusters localized in temporal and frontal lobe.

fb241239103a5146511b62abc1c1f4553c90653b,SPECtre: a spectral coherence-based classifier of actively translated transcripts from ribosome profiling sequence data,"BackgroundActive protein translation can be assessed and measured using ribosome profiling sequencing strategies. Prevailing analytical approaches applied to this technology make use of sequence fragment length profiling or reading frame occupancy enrichment to differentiate between active translation and background noise, however they do not consider additional characteristics inherent to the technology which limits their overall accuracy.ResultsHere, we present an analytical tool that models the overall triÂ­nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence. Our software, SPECtre, examines the relationship of normalized ribosome profiling read coverage over a rolling series of windows along a transcript relative to an idealized reference signal without the matched requirement of mRNA-Seq.ConclusionsA comparison of SPECtre against previously published methods on existing data shows a marked improvement in accuracy for detecting active translation and exhibits overall high accuracy at a low false discovery rate. In addition, SPECtre performs comparably to a recently published method similarly based on spectral coherence, however with reduced runtime and memory requirements.

62274dca105b74948b36de7e91a849a7d746e8a4,Experimental right ventricular failure is associated with dysregulation of genes involved in dilated cardiomyopathy,"Purpose: We aimed to identify pathways involved in experimental right ventricular failure (RVF) due to chronic pressure overload.

Methods: Wistar rats were subjected to pulmonary artery banding (PAB) (1.1mm, n=12) or sham surgery (CON, n=7) and then daily checked for clinical signs of RVF (inactivity, ruffled fur, dyspnea, ascites). At the onset of clinical RVF (necessitating termination) pressure-volume analysis was performed in the rats with RVF and in randomly selected PAB rats without clinical signs of RVF (RVDysfunction, RVD) at the same time points. Gene micro array was performed on RV tissue using GeneChip Rat Gene 1.1 ST (Affymetrics). Quality control and normalization (RMA) were performed according to international standards. False discovery rate was set to 1.3 in RVF vs. RVD. Micro array data were analyzed using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology mapping (biological processes) (ErmineJ) and pathway analysis (DAVID).

Results: All rats with PAB had RV dysfunction, but clinical RVF ensued in only 5 rats, after a period of 52Â±5 days. RVF rats had pericardial effusion, liver congestion, and widely dilated right atria, in contrast to RVD rats. RVF rats also had significantly lower cardiac index (0.10Â±0.04 vs. 0.19Â±0.04 mL/min/g, RVF vs. RVD, p<0.05). In RVF contractility was preserved (end systolic elastance 269Â±173 vs. 101Â±44mmHg/mL, ns), but diastolic function deteriorated (end diastolic elastance 32Â±21 vs. 11Â±4mmHg/mL; end diastolic pressure 6Â±3 vs. 3Â±1mmHg, RVF vs. RVD, p<0.05).

We identified 9 pathways that were differentially regulated in RVF vs. RVD. Among these, the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) KEGG-pathway was negatively enriched in RVF compared to RVD (normalized enrichment score= -1.94, p<0.05). Gene ontology mapping supported the dysregulation of the DCM pathway in RVF; 10 ontology categories overlapping with the DCM pathway were strongly decreased in RVF vs. RVD (p<1.00E-10 for all categories). Further pathway analysis and comparison to CON, revealed that within the DCM pathway, the dysregulation involved transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) 2 (Rank Metric Score: -4.316 RVF vs. RVD), TGFÎ² 3 (RMS: -3.840) and specific calcium channel-subunits: CACNA2D2 (RMS: -2.429), CACNA2D3 (RMS: -1.754), CACNA1D (RMS: -1.730) and CACNB3 (RMS: -2.429).

Conclusions: We identified novel pathways involved in experimental RVF. RVF is associated with dysregulation of specific parts of the dilated cardiomyopathy pathway. New studies should explore whether an imbalance in TGFÎ² activation or alterations in calcium cycling are central in the pathobiology of RVF.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""A. M. C.

Generalized q-sampling (GQI) and connectometry analysis provide new indices, i.e., quantitative anisotropy (QA) and spin distribution function (SDF) in comparison with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). They may provide more age-related changes in white matter (WM) in aging.


PURPOSE
To investigate the feasibility of using GQI and connectometry analysis to determine WM properties changes in aging.


STUDY TYPE
Cross-cohort research.


POPULATION
Fifty normal adults (27 females) aged 21-71 years.


FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE
T1 -weighted images (T1 WI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) images were acquired at 1.5T.


ASSESSMENT
HARDI data were analyzed using DTI and GQI to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA), QA, fiber numbers, and fiber lengths for tract analysis and using q-space diffeomorphic reconstruction (QSDR) for the connectometry analysis. We compared differences of DTI, GQI, and connectometry analysis to reflect WM changes in aging.


STATISTICAL TESTS
Associations between FA, QA, and fiber numbers and lengths and age were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. The connectometry analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression analysis, including age and gender as factors. Uncorrected P-value/false discovery rate (FDR) (corrected for multiple comparisons) < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.


RESULTS
More regional changes were detected in FA related to age than changes in QA (17 > 6 regions, P < 0.05). Fewer regional changes in fiber numbers and more changes of fiber lengths were observed for DTI than for GQI (5 < 8/10 > 7 regions, P < 0.05). However, DTI and GQI analyses revealed consistent results in some regions, including the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC), body of the corpus callosum (BCC), fornix (Fx), and anterior coronal radiation (ACR) (P < 0.05). The connectometry analysis showed more tract changes associated with age at an FDR of 0.05, which partially overlapped with the FA and QA.


DATA CONCLUSION
GQI and connectometry provide more information about age-related tracts and complement the DTI findings.

fbdd2b8d5bdb74d7978b730d779216fa3031b7d2,A Genome-Wide Detection of Copy Number Variations Using SNP Genotyping Arrays in Braque FranÃ§ais Type PyrÃ©nÃ©es Dogs,"Copy number variants (CNVs) are an important source of genetic variation complementary to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Only few studies have been conducted in dogs on CNVs derived from high-density SNP array data, and many canine breeds still remain uncharacterized, e.g., the Braque FranÃ§ais, type PyrÃ©nÃ©es breed (BRA). Therefore, in an effort to more comprehensively investigate the canine genome for CNVs, we used a high-density SNP array (170 K) to discover CNVs in BRA. The CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified through the merging of two different CNVRs datasets, obtained separately from SNP data using the PennCNV and SVS software. A total of 45 stringent CNVRs, ranging from 3.5 kb to 458,716 kb in length were detected in 26 dog samples. Results overlapped moderately in comparison with previous studies on CNVs in dogs, leading to the identification of 16 novel CNVRs. A total of 159 genes were annotated in the CNVRs detected with stringent quality criteria in particular high classification stringency and false discovery rate correction. The gene ontology enrichment analysis provided information on biological processes and cellular components related to muscle structure development and muscle cell differentiation. Considering that BRA is a breed used for speed in hunting and retrieval, for the ability to find feathered game, and for pointing, we can hypothesize that selection for such hunting behavior could have driven, at least in part, the presence of these genes into the CNVRs.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rosalia Di Gerlando"", ids = ""3982372""); list(name = ""Salvatore Mastrangelo"", ids = ""40234203""); list(name = ""Maria Teresa Sardina"", ids = ""47395205""); list(name = ""Marco Ragatzu"", ids = ""32349598""); list(name = ""Andrea Spaterna"", ids = ""6617110""); list(name = ""Baldassare Portolano"", ids = ""4361649""); list(name = ""Filippo Biscarini"", ids = ""9853417""); list(name = ""Roberta Ciampolini"", ids = ""6090032"")",408889afb38f2bd542dd90cb24b8c15dbc7a9d7e,df6d93d37dcfa54d1fa9f9cca4a8b0b1f827eca7; 0e0e999ef12a27a750d451be8e167a89f71dacdf; e16a68067cf504872a06e6f099aad8026dd97ce6; 4de05ee87b3d24fe5466aa627731905901482f4d; 588488e79972ee33853167f8b2f4f884f984d03c; 3c36614fb75e2daf348a7a26ac3974a3a230e9d2; e612678de906206d6debd79b2d2e01d076d8631b; dec701d71849c027ec5ecf1850fe87e735ea9bdc; 7f5e0b1f780ce0267eb24ceb83a11d28960b4b70; c762dec6c6a352a19918fee83828a8a1b0148dae; 5abfe8534e5256e3228237942d3a19ae87a631b4; 116b5d818f5d8e365579c81f8a0131af47956a47; 4249e1d658670c2f3253ecf384f31029acbaddeb; 6f26c4ee621330c28aa4ed00c63b6dac7647cd7c; c3c295f2c2beda7e294393e973c8d9e86577fa8b; 229a1c43ba9256154b52717e2670f69795ed9f63; 332e61162c3b45f5bfcd2af2a48e5f9f7f783d65; 18be05177adfd9c941a1eeb1922b9254de236d9a; d4c605c47fbe67a998a6cc06963b6e33961f7dca; 17f528476f149b2449614bb184933d56f898f0e6; 8ebfdc87e0d4d723358fac6585b69dbc8a0cf001; 96bf468c7d37bf9bb1d39724b5746baa8863341e; 5cfa393e32dbc0003c903ee98cb424022cd581f4; 3fa1a4942ad8e096d7e5b5ba89d5cfa749e07d51; 9fba7513f0ee4a4fc946e844a117cb6859f561be; 3fd068d6784fcc6f6ca318ef928afa93dd987653,Animals : an Open Access Journal from MDPI,9,
94568c698349b0237b9656d80d2e6bfac1bb5dd3,Exploring influence of subliminal interoception on whole-brain functional network connectivity dynamics,"Recent fMRI studies have highlighted a dynamic relation across large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) of human brain. The origin of such temporal variations in functional connectivity especially during the task-free (resting-state) fMRI is still a matter of debate and ongoing investigation. In this exploratory study, we sought to determine whether subliminal differences in interoception (e.g., distention pressure on the viscera) can influence the dynamics of whole-brain functional network connectivity. A group of healthy right-handed female subjects, close in age (n = 15, mean age Â± SD = 30.33 Â± 8.7 years) underwent a series of eyes-open resting-state fMRI scans under different interoceptive conditions including catheterization and partial bladder filling. Using a high-dimensional independent component analysis, the functional imaging data were parcellated into 75 components, out of which 33 were identified as non-artifactual ICNs. Changes in dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) were evaluated using the sliding-time window approach and k-means clustering algorithm. We used subject medians for each cluster state and compared differences in dFNC correlations using a paired t-test. Following a false discovery rate multiple comparison correction threshold of p<;0.05, no significant differences in dFNC were found. However, different dwell times for each (pseudo-)resting-state were observed. More liberal statistical criteria (uncorrected p<;0.005) also indicated differences in dFNC between ICN pairs especially involving the salience, subcortical, sensorimotor, cerebellar and brainstem networks. Further investigations of the effect of internal (bodily) sensations on the time-varying aspects of functional connectivity can improve our understanding of the nature of temporal fluctuations in interrelations between intrinsic brain networks.",2015,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Behnaz Jarrahi"", ids = ""2581057""); list(name = ""Dante Mantini"", ids = ""2702784""); list(name = ""Ulrich Mehnert"", ids = ""2484728""); list(name = ""Spyros Sreejanth Kollias"", ids = ""145389579"")",f4c5ef4c0b35ce3c49c27a1a3ffa659acb3ebc15; c34c6696122c623f4196afe20e73ca99ce94e948; 57a2aa7df873c06b69e3054ccbdb5a5c9972839d; a03889ae32e07efc69235467512bf2474c1d5371; 6a6592999af36971fab1fc67a372239e72db57f3; e2fb56f6aa098ec82319b084db98fbd8f3b5c59c,85e7d96dfd5efcbb0711bcc89039ba0d1dbda64e; 16e1d74262355b27cc21026e65c89468de7d60f6; 5eee60ed2345954d8e97bca6aac28fd726312bae; ae4832cab2de0e20bcb704cf8e4eb5cd153f1756; 8ca5820081f8c3a85b8125148124238d6d7d8c77; 5b315d88d81fe1bbf20b9b4b1ebab40d1efd1aed; 7e21226e1a42301eb91fe3fc609decfe7903365e; 2bf4d427314921d1f14fac02c86929dff74c1a3c; 06a0f233789b54f5c56e2f7042234cd14ba716d1; 7ef16f997257c30bd5a36b1dec6a3329afd35c4f; 1bdad148e76307af9f4a5d918a963137f419a335; ea02e7f7cea571d2b5c78e57b278a6ef17d8ff24; c2cae15f8335f2c4d28c78a6e145e1665a70e0b7; 96ab5d872d150f2cdc3aacae8c3162c8fde72d4b,2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),,670-674

While the field significance approach determines if a field as a whole is significant, a multiple testing procedure determines which particular tests are significant. Many such procedures are available, most of which control, for every test, the probability of detecting significance that does not really exist. The aim of this paper is to introduce the novel â€œfalse discovery rateâ€ approach, which controls the false rejections in a more meaningful way. Specifically, it controls a priori the expected proportion of falsely rejected tests out of all rejected tests; additionally, the test results are more easily interpretable.

5e137f163560ec21f5689d4f16892b4bee09b929,Genetic variants in noncoding PIWI-interacting RNA and colorectal cancer risk.,"BACKGROUND
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which are a novel type of identified small noncoding RNA (ncRNA), play a crucial role in germline development and carcinogenesis.


METHODS
By systematically screening all known piRNAs, the authors identified 7 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 9 piRNAs. Associations between these selected SNPs and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) were detected in a case-control study. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to evaluate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of piR-015551 and of the long ncRNA (lncRNA) LNC00964-3 in 88 pairs of tissue samples.


RESULTS
The assay revealed that reference SNP rs11776042 in piR-015551 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of CRC in an additive model (P =â€‰.020). However, this protective effect was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons (test for the false discovery rate; P =â€‰.140). Furthermore, the authors observed that mRNA expression levels of LNC00964-3 (an lncRNA that included the piR-015551 sequence but not piR-015551) were significantly lower in CRC tissues than in corresponding normal tissues (P = 1.5 Ã— 10(-5) for LNC00964-3; P =â€‰.899 for piR-015551). Correlation analysis revealed that piR-015551 expression was positively correlated with expression levels of LNC00964-3 (CRC tissues: r = 0.574, P = 5.13 Ã— 10(-9) ; normal tissues: r = 0.601, P = 5.76 Ã— 10(-10)). Moreover, rs11776042 was not significantly correlated with mRNA expression levels of piR-015551 or LNC00964-3 (all P >â€‰.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The current findings reveal the possibility that piR-015551 may be generated from LNC00964-3, which may be involved in the development of CRC.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Haiyan Chu"", ids = ""2063143""); list(name = ""Liping Xia"", ids = ""51184336""); list(name = ""Xiaonan Qiu"", ids = ""4853103""); list(name = ""Dongying Gu"", ids = ""5413219""); list(name = ""Linjun Zhu"", ids = ""2666387""); list(name = ""Jing Jin"", ids = ""50736707""); list(name = ""Gaoyun Hui"", ids = ""39782973""); list(name = ""Qiuhan Hua"", ids = ""4055199""); list(name = ""Mulong Du"", ids = ""145048803""); list(name = ""Na Tong"", ids = ""9329857""); list(name = ""Jinfei Chen"", ids = ""27103563""); list(name = ""Zhengdong Zhang"", ids = ""2554701""); list(name = ""Meilin Wang"", ids = ""38673410"")",6211cedda70dd3f4f3577945a061c3d616b6a208; a82f968c7cbae869d95d489c8a3e0c96285727bf; ad6923472f6b6eb3dc6a240bea30db4c1b2ce44a; adf7a4a928609b047c10cac3fb3ba19f219ba5f3; b4725b4eecf4c03cfb94e4c9ca6e3bdd0849d67c; 03f72c9bd5ba965dceaa18a285713dcc40a00d1d; 3fc24a6214936030a624ba5b743d02fdbdec1e05; 1821316a45ecfa48aa75390dc57e39e7b93f3a5f; 4667efe4bb6f4d4e46539e400f97f84066ceacb5; 9aad028b576c301ce446a48f2898f1e0c3a0e88f; f452054a6b19b40ceeafbc7bec05fc8359c1af88; c536bcb0377d30ec9c7d1af8c0867117266f6ca9; c7adaa69a86812ab9eff9474bedfbac77d31c6c0; 03024a311472e8b5e2babbbfb27ecd8e37191499; 4bf743d0dafe176f39fa4f7424aff5dcad80bfc1; 57ebcbff7e9c7f0d0aaf59bf310e37ffe179f360; 40d3728e24f2fc83f79e7a84b5726aed3f4895da,4814d539308b1d34a2f5dbc408e24e7043d4800b; 2eb9ad6aa377f4892cb5dbe016167f522d1db996; eaf6acaf76d772ec1c98035387e7508ed4695a1c; 9169d5af5914cb11770faf9763a0c43915c3124c; ce2924e885e7871ce19292a7957ab0b1ecb19f9a; 13defa260268d07ea1d0620f66603711df28b413; ada9bc02772ff75f4c31f8d3e9bba9b5fd8ec4c2; 917268ce9560c5cf8f1a49f0890668bb2de0346f; 98b9d91aedf9f4075773cf94b58ccede16908bc6; 898b87bcfa1504c1d01ba774201003a20563c85e; f71e2a9ff10d141a9a1123ad2cc8777e7634a4d9; 4e74a027530f5cf993e7a73736e1c873c085e523; aa7c9c99bc29873da78c5d41ffe7f5ee8f0563ad; 511e9a9e0b4f86692a668ceddedcf795286e2310; b5932747379eeecbfdb03fc180113911b29d1331; 1f59288e90f561628a43eef82329c889b39bd425; 69f6313d35b44ec8b8a8187c80ffade115c13de1; d0b09b3b4c5bceb7f50483bd7d81c2de29e39bd3; 6f64289a57f4f5f26b2de2622e90ffd82d98d319; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; 433f148274ab2d0ea5759ba814ad02952c47bbf1; 2b1c697327353d53d759aab5ce4177335ff2ccaa; 6d345dca6a85ac8fcf8bcca8a2f64213c19d4699; 8b4902b938ca0a0991d6b24ca08b760d41fe15eb; 9c510162fb585134a660cd09a59468461c768696; 86022571b9839fec93a7a900872f69830ef45ce4; 1d22637d5afb93c6c88e4b9048405361e4d8a741; a16c9effe91811720e85b6f539bbe5ac4841ae75; e49d55d9b4b27a385eb5d711942ee4ffe3792b0f; e69ea79cb824acfe3afc3bf9a0f7d98b4956b647; 76657e7d8cda701faf499e0b63509c4b5420d78b; dabb2d90d666148a1c73834a4f0f5b2c3e0fb76c; 2bfe29b9aab4e8df1f81e09541df2e6097e108c6; 919c9ca2df30bbac5c92338d75c8aa5692d6a1ca; d083c2efec29278dc7c9004663236a24712e19b5; b0bcd68ac093c0f85710b95c2468a9a9492f83ac; 1e3a8f05027719ff8317c7d60e7c5b30a6ca708c; 525e9b13430dbe83425750df3a60afbc491918aa; aa19a3a5e394b6d191b499b5f426e852e1375bf6; 6b3800afd99dcd38b113fc74eb7686f5bec8549d; 4980757153663e06d4d466ef680fcc8783aa3587; 8c0973f6ac6bdccff3479eee1c7e7e296f7cf092; 523b6246febf860709411adb121e9771afec72f8; bed435222ddb9e9390677ad3eef22422468512e8; 0673fe9752d31043ecb09a105ecb8a088c131222; 7a3a732d2ceaa7346721aab6f6af4061b723ca90; d21beb17492ba626cd291e6eb852465ed638f909; ea6dddf8237eb6c1aacec8c9e6c3158a61745814; fd0953e40cf2802d63e7b436cbbd02efd2674352; 883a616048057336fd06b1aa025cccbf56024f47; 98df497d72d98be56e48b6c5df0329ceffe41588; 77e340a7bfbd7c9d05a35147b6f9a2097b67eb2f; 9c6d9d3147115e28adaac1b5d2642825ef864a99; ae0eb15b779a132471e535454bc4f6a62354b03f; 1abd198f80b3671b44861adb5bb5ddfd97c8b9bc,Cancer,121 12,"

fdf7f8c7162471c1adbab4d33759d6acf9b8f680,DEgenes Hunter - A Self-customised Gene Expression Analysis Workflow for Non-model Organisms,"Data from high-throughput RNA sequencing require the development of more sophisticate bioinformatics tools to perform optimal gene expression analysis. Several R libraries are well considered for differential expression analyses but according to recent comparative studies, there is still an overall disagreement about which one is the most appropriate for each experiment. The applicable R libraries mainly depend on the presence or not of a reference genome and the number of replicates per condition. Here it is presented DEgenes Hunter, a RNA-seq analysis workflow for the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in organisms without genomic reference. The first advantage of DEgenes Hunter over other available solutions is that it is able to decide the most suitable algorithms to be employed according to the number of biological replicates provided in the sample. The different workflow branches allow its automatic self-customisation depending on the input data, when used by users without advanced statistical and programming skills. All applicable libraries served to obtain their respective DEGs and, as another advantage, genes marked as DEGs by all R packages employed are considered â€˜common DEGsâ€™, showing the lowest false discovery rate compared to the â€˜complete DEGsâ€™ group. A third advantage of DEgenes Hunter is that it comes with an integrated quality control module to discard or disregard low quality data before and after preprocessing. The â€˜common DEGsâ€™ are finally submitted to a functional gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and clustering.

6dc114d330b14059342fc925e3c8e28cc356eb0b,Integrative analysis of multiple gene expression profiles applied to liver cancer study.,"A statistical method for combining multiple microarray studies has been previously developed by the authors. Here, we present the application of the method to our hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) data and report new findings on gene expression changes accompanying HCC. From the cross-verification result of our studies and that of published studies, we found that single microarray analysis might lead to false findings. To avoid those pitfalls of single-set analyses, we employed our effect size method to integrate multiple datasets. Of 9982 genes analyzed, 477 significant genes were identified with a false discovery rate of 10%. Gene ontology (GO) terms associated with these genes were explored to validate our method in the biological context with respect to HCC. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the data integration process increases the sensitivity of analysis and allows small but consistent expression changes to be detected. These integration-driven discoveries contained meaningful and interesting genes not reported in previous expression profiling studies, such as growth hormone receptor, erythropoietin receptor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2, etc. Our findings support the use of meta-analysis for a variety of microarray data beyond the scope of this specific application.",2004,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jung Kyoon Choi"", ids = ""2050953""); list(name = ""Jong Young Choi"", ids = ""1754789""); list(name = ""Dae Ghon Kim"", ids = ""6983334""); list(name = ""Dong Wook Choi"", ids = ""144616006""); list(name = ""Bu Yeo Kim"", ids = ""152802701""); list(name = ""Kee Ho Lee"", ids = ""5912968""); list(name = ""Young Il Yeom"", ids = ""2654909""); list(name = ""Hyang Sook Yoo"", ids = ""6185915""); list(name = ""Ook Joon Yoo"", ids = ""2218793""); list(name = ""Sangsoo Kim"", ids = ""33839647"")",e8a1a2c3453b54d705108129b975ba33fee00552; 98822ada79d1e77daf9c9a62147b0f9ea5d7abf1; 3bba33e612a4f2afa1e81673bc89c3ef6b15e196; f8ac79d02b3cc0f5251d36085a1f243bb1e23313; 9ef33b2cad43c357776b17f47e855ec29a75a361; a81fd86ab87c8395729593d69905e3b3639f5bb8; 6328d7b3c8c57a1e29db95679eb4e2119326ce54; 6737cb5ca3c29203c4c0a6ebee6a24f2a83ad9f2; 67c849b09e12cf167d684661c16698ce633b617d; cc49a2cf0206b2e02204fc0bf4728b0ba1208aa2; 68cb35407eacc8ed55493324320108337cc3ec0f; acfaa3d75825b8eaa5770e01054b881a1e9aa6a7; a1d470d4c319ba0b47db2faaf25d627d6051635c; 9bff30652fe79eee64dd6ecfaec0040f1fa4bde5; 145213b529d0b4c4f63e2a9e3cc0ca8ac8f1211e; 2fca79b8d0eb47ab33fc8391fa0806467409e203; 2eebec5a3d54de0c5ab85c20307bbe7239e09e7e; bb38dce6bff8a732d9bf199a106d4280d808c63d; 592e370fb566db967dc57a8e2e8979cb1d19dda3; 42c138e06a20bff640d4f6b8ba098a9086cebfc3; eddee2dabc622c3119c9b4a7c230614ee1368432; 6fbf624076cf5505cd0a828ff998304244b47802; 2e05709ffd28bc821f222492c913eba553364644; 742c053968d3b6aef3894ac9388772286d9d3db1; 6bd03d6c45a832c6af55732222ba067a0877b9aa; 9239bcc78e54ece571fd464a5e1d0a434102e84b; 12af391478c755877f288524872c95e6f3e30e66; c431fe6e5bc8299ad520a27da8e03f5449e9050b; dba4a9584acd2db195852a3ac954d5ec42bde5c9; 2e6824dc8d6edb65e59dfec2f2216bf9dfee0592; 48eeaecb5370380535583c65d0bf9be8cbbc2c54; ebd19509d9b2cd9a5a7218d77b55f05a7b937ea8; 408ca7cc18dd313b2afcd4d0eee52e4312e2e4f1; 368c16ce0938f499ebd949602c0397ce72861ecc; b22678ff74896dad24599df2db5365b72f0da125; 9a537a963a0835b9ac55677b8ebcd16cb19bbd04; dbd3bc9d84385bacd982eb5421946a7f6295a821; 3dfab4e3c4f605e1c48de94a08b0dcf3828a1157; cbe350659596726cd87ef38963a395167f07db77; f9811ac7e318b528b70aed8e66f4506d03cdedce; 260e7f569da5b92bc048e5d1d375aade3dfd7464; e016bd95b8069da74adfaf25559c3e8522795cb8; e5ce81d1b8b68f8a2ae3e7ca851019602cae8aed; 38466c8165ec4c590721a469314ce86f3bc886f0; a456fa3d941807ed2fe2dc6fc8a8a5165faa8ef7; 934c610f0c81d14d53d381d910d0dc0591131a4d; 3cf1fc5f34af504c2f7929808d5f4eecd83ce8a5; d5c3880fa49d3fa25fc5529ca38894e4530b502f; d310956bfc0c5c302fc221eb6f02c639e67d1120; 73e87460a00939120ef7be676f4cb65de7e08212; 063ca128ae5a80aec98e30255df0d020148cd3ff; 9b1104b2ccb8953078977efc8f2f79479c6f5801; b3b965c4daedc7980d595f189b622b416276bf23; d3055fb875a75629ac0cc78b478fe9a69622da17; 1a5c901fe08676dd326f9f675e40a86a54de0894; a05c4bcae53df41b0ac3bc2987f05538f49baaf6; b8970809314f40189fedbb14e40959247c4dae30; 2d3ba46359dad4909460b242bb8b6a6713c332d8; 9e738b1d1efeedee0ee79053e437b54875d89fde; 6ae5259adeec3f7bf3a6ad426346728f3731653f; 923f877d32d616798faf76cf4563e6f21d1a1550; 97eeb4d93678844ddb621db42d43a63a3a07de15; fa0e152b2867e6366bdd7be74145e953ea36d357; f9453541a05d324c44315079046f99f2759e14af; f3631ef73141e9b143042f1f8a0405ac4330611b; 844bbbb60464cf01d787de041ffa2b2065a88188; 6062cf8be18ab1141a7bbe78485363ecdc414780; e8562a26e7a6486590cebcd825e254da7a217396,,FEBS letters,565 1-3,"

e768224d204315e65a3d0a8daeb74350a1ad20d3,"Position Weight Matrix, Gibbs Sampler, and the Associated Significance Tests in Motif Characterization and Prediction","Position weight matrix (PWM) is not only one of the most widely used bioinformatic methods, but also a key component in more advanced computational algorithms (e.g., Gibbs sampler) for characterizing and discovering motifs in nucleotide or amino acid sequences. However, few generally applicable statistical tests are available for evaluating the significance of site patterns, PWM, and PWM scores (PWMS) of putative motifs. Statistical significance tests of the PWM output, that is, site-specific frequencies, PWM itself, and PWMS, are in disparate sources and have never been collected in a single paper, with the consequence that many implementations of PWM do not include any significance test. Here I review PWM-based methods used in motif characterization and prediction (including a detailed illustration of the Gibbs sampler for de novo motif discovery), present statistical and probabilistic rationales behind statistical significance tests relevant to PWM, and illustrate their application with real data. The multiple comparison problem associated with the test of site-specific frequencies is best handled by false discovery rate methods. The test of PWM, due to the use of pseudocounts, is best done by resampling methods. The test of individual PWMS for each sequence segment should be based on the extreme value distribution.",2012,Engineering; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xuhua Xia"", ids = ""1976568"")",b1db297ce08b91cccfe572a1f6e60a741436362f;

38dbfa304e730add6e135b55f657313440ff75d1,A Peripheral Blood DNA Methylation Signature of Hepatic Fat Reveals a Potential Causal Pathway for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to identify the peripheral blood DNA methylation signature of hepatic fat. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies of hepatic fat in 3,400 European ancestry (EA) participants and in 401 Hispanic ancestry and 724 African ancestry participants from four population-based cohort studies. Hepatic fat was measured using computed tomography or ultrasound imaging and DNA methylation was assessed at >400,000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in whole blood or CD14+ monocytes using a commercial array. We identified 22 CpGs associated with hepatic fat in EA participants at a false discovery rate <0.05 (corresponding P = 6.9 Ã— 10-6) with replication at Bonferroni-corrected P < 8.6 Ã— 10-4 Mendelian randomization analyses supported the association of hypomethylation of cg08309687 (LINC00649) with NAFLD (P = 2.5 Ã— 10-4). Hypomethylation of the same CpG was also associated with risk for new-onset T2D (P = 0.005). Our study demonstrates that a peripheral blood-derived DNA methylation signature is robustly associated with hepatic fat accumulation. The hepatic fat-associated CpGs may represent attractive biomarkers for T2D. Future studies are warranted to explore mechanisms and to examine DNA methylation signatures of NAFLD across racial/ethnic groups.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiantao Ma"", ids = ""3108684""); list(name = ""Jana Nano"", ids = ""50082454""); list(name = ""Jingzhong Ding"", ids = ""2171224""); list(name = ""Yinan Zheng"", ids = ""2112470""); list(name = ""Rachel Hennein"", ids = ""15372012""); list(name = ""Chunyu Liu"", ids = ""49047124""); list(name = ""Elizabeth K.

54bd1f7a4977808d2125cf31e2300ba2081108a1,Circulating inflammation-related markers and advanced gastric premalignant lesions.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM
Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastric mucosal inflammation as an important antecedent of gastric cancer. We aimed to evaluate associations of blood markers of inflammation with gastric intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia in H.Â pylori-infected individuals.


METHODS
We compared pre-treatment serum levels of immune-related and inflammation-related markers between 99 individuals with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia and 75 control individuals with non-atrophic gastritis within an H.Â pylori eradication trial in Mexico. Serum levels of 28 markers measured with Luminex bead-based assays were categorized in tertiles as low (T1), middle (T2), and high (T3). Logistic regression models were used to calculate age-adjusted and sex-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. All statistical tests were two-sided, and significance values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate methods.


RESULTS
Five markers were nominally associated (Ptrend Â <Â 0.05) with the presence of advanced premalignant gastric lesions. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of T2 and T3 versus T1 were 4.09 (1.65-10.17) and 3.08 (1.23-7.68) for CCL3/MIP1A, 3.21 (1.33-7.75) and 2.69 (1.10-6.57) for CCL20/MIP3A levels, 1.79 (0.77-4.18) and 2.39 (1.02-5.60) for IL-1Î², 1.34 (0.56-3.19) and 3.02 (1.29-7.12) for IL-4, and 1.07 (0.44-2.59) and 3.07 (1.32-7.14) for IL-5, respectively. Two (IL-4 and IL-5) of the five markers had false discovery rate adjusted Ptrend Â <Â 0.2.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that certain Th2 and other cytokines may have a role in promoting carcinogenesis in the setting of H.Â pylori infection.

bb03839f3da57d7582813efb6b3430b463c378af,"MR-PheWAS: hypothesis prioritization among potential causal effects of body mass index on many outcomes, using Mendelian randomization","Observational cohort studies can provide rich datasets with a diverse range of phenotypic variables. However, hypothesis-driven epidemiological analyses by definition only test particular hypotheses chosen by researchers. Furthermore, observational analyses may not provide robust evidence of causality, as they are susceptible to confounding, reverse causation and measurement error. Using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplar, we demonstrate a novel extension to the phenome-wide association study (pheWAS) approach, using automated screening with genotypic instruments to screen for causal associations amongst any number of phenotypic outcomes. We used a sample of 8,121 children from the ALSPAC dataset, and tested the linear association of a BMI-associated allele score with 172 phenotypic outcomes (with variable sample sizes). We also performed an instrumental variable analysis to estimate the causal effect of BMI on each phenotype. We found 21 of the 172 outcomes were associated with the allele score at an unadjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 threshold, and use Bonferroni corrections, permutation testing and estimates of the false discovery rate to consider the strength of results given the number of tests performed. The most strongly associated outcomes included leptin, lipid profile, and blood pressure.

75df0d8a8b6877f3d7750f03b2cb93915cd2bf05,Genes-environment interactions in obesity- and diabetes-associated pancreatic cancer: a GWAS data analysis.,"BACKGROUND
Obesity and diabetes are potentially alterable risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Genetic factors that modify the associations of obesity and diabetes with pancreatic cancer have previously not been examined at the genome-wide level.


METHODS
Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotype and risk factor data from the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium, we conducted a discovery study of 2,028 cases and 2,109 controls to examine gene-obesity and gene-diabetes interactions in relation to pancreatic cancer risk by using the likelihood-ratio test nested in logistic regression models and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).


RESULTS
After adjusting for multiple comparisons, a significant interaction of the chemokine signaling pathway with obesity (P = 3.29 Ã— 10(-6)) and a near significant interaction of calcium signaling pathway with diabetes (P = 1.57 Ã— 10(-4)) in modifying the risk of pancreatic cancer were observed. These findings were supported by results from IPA analysis of the top genes with nominal interactions. The major contributing genes to the two top pathways include GNGT2, RELA, TIAM1, and GNAS. None of the individual genes or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) except one SNP remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Notably, SNP rs10818684 of the PTGS1 gene showed an interaction with diabetes (P = 7.91 Ã— 10(-7)) at a false discovery rate of 6%.


CONCLUSIONS
Genetic variations in inflammatory response and insulin resistance may affect the risk of obesity- and diabetes-related pancreatic cancer. These observations should be replicated in additional large datasets.

bcafd3f2a2680f91725125ab270417852d4261d2,Statistical selection of biological models for genome-wide association analyses.,"Genome-wide association studies have discovered many biologically important associations of genes with phenotypes. Typically, genome-wide association analyses formally test the association of each genetic feature (SNP, CNV, etc) with the phenotype of interest and summarize the results with multiplicity-adjusted p-values. However, very small p-values only provide evidence against the null hypothesis of no association without indicating which biological model best explains the observed data. Correctly identifying a specific biological model may improve the scientific interpretation and can be used to more effectively select and design a follow-up validation study. Thus, statistical methodology to identify the correct biological model for a particular genotype-phenotype association can be very useful to investigators. Here, we propose a general statistical method to summarize how accurately each of five biological models (null, additive, dominant, recessive, co-dominant) represents the data observed for each variant in a GWAS study. We show that the new method stringently controls the false discovery rate and asymptotically selects the correct biological model.

5650d924521afb4a39f8ff9b129d847804f3cf89,A Novel Method Combining Linkage Disequilibrium Information and Imputed Functional Knowledge for tagSNP Selection,"Analyses of high-density SNPs in genetic studies have the potential problems of prohibitive genotyping costs and inflated false discovery rates. Current methods select subsets of representative SNPs (tagSNPs) using information either on potential biologic functionality of the SNPs or on the underlying linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, but not both. Combining the two types of information may lead to more effective tagSNP selection. The proposed method combines both functional and LD information using a weighted factor analysis (WFA) model. The WFA was applied to the dense SNP collection from 129 genes sequenced by the SeattleSNPs Program for Genomic Application. TagSNPs selected by WFA were compared with those selected by an LD-based method. WFA allowed prioritization of SNPs that would otherwise share equivalent ranking due to underlying LD structure alone. Furthermore, WFA consistently included SNPs not selected by function or by LD alone. A literature review of a subset of genes revealed that SNPs selected by WFA were more likely represented in published reports.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""R.H.

Proteins from the kidneys of knockout Cyld mice and wild-type mice were extracted, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) was performed, and the proteomics patterns of the two groups were compared. The genotypes of the mice were verified by polymerase chain reaction. A total of 1748 proteins with a local false discovery rate of â‰¤5% were identified, among which 1437 proteins were reliably recognized and quantified. The expression of two dysregulated proteins was confirmed by Western blotting. Gene ontology and pathway analyses indicated that the proteins identified were involved in biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions, and participated in different pathways. Some of the proteins identified were relevant to renal function or kidney diseases. The difference between the proteomics profiles of kidneys from Cyld knockout mice and wild-type mice was prominent, which correlates to kidney dysfunction and the development of renal diseases.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Y Zhao"", ids = ""46317465""); list(name = ""Yingjie Zhang"", ids = ""27995632""); list(name = ""Haibo Song"", ids = ""47084622""); list(name = ""Fei Wu"", ids = ""144894847""); list(name = ""Xing Li Wang"", ids = ""32853560""); list(name = ""S Sun"", ids = ""122842264""); list(name = ""Tongxiao Cui"", ids = ""50852595""); list(name = ""Dongqi Tang"", ids = ""46513535"")",1fe15b9fd10000bf547435cc7e79eb03744c08df; 9c8b19d15efe39f93b9b99f9145a1ee781adfd5d,99af8509ffe584a145c552aa46c9fccea5adc5af; 1803f983b2f5f3ee7868a8e6c22620cf1152cdc0; a5d6ebd414a00302aa512857294e153a83caab62; 7781714609ef77df90cfa7dcbd102b625a053683; 6d2b5f34b908a673f79087b5a9e88141fc7701f6; 34c1f6d6c414d0e9459cf5a430fa67c64c45ad12; f2815a49b814150daa5ae621708e0636ad5d16af; 7289f6ccbe433da35bd8b14fb782b665af909b46; 6791b6a72488fce783189c1b3c0eaa729111425d; 019f50b8b1356f1eb5e6b3b0fc98747ca9e6e8c2; 00b58f1ee2731465db5eb8fd8f1f7a66495e08bb; 650de36db27bf6c87208857d3f1afb391605fce3; 97543a684920e301d193b2467b54ce2d196f68b1; e33f88ca40d5a5120cdfd0fe3facdbf9a0d20172; b793a56758e228642bdd501c589830a6ab1a4912; 5d8f418817e79f987615b612ae98a5487786bb97; e4b85b004f132cb705225f22d8f32e214e0b6ea7; 44db31c41ab0845a121901fe8ca24a5709b8ef3b; c8ed2099d7a27a8ccfbfdefefe46122a78d957c1; 8955db7256d40ee8c2adcbb288bf3c61ad3e2e2f; 10c61ef53e63ef91f1a67266b0bcddb8c744cb2a; 19cf7ab5cda2d54d35c0f0b8d29cc0f4ae0fde38,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,14 2,"

For this study, 3 replicate Q Exactive Orbitrap liquid chromatography-tandom mass spectrometry datasets were generated from each of 4 Escherichia coli samples spiked with different equimolar mixtures of small recombinant proteins selected to mimic pairs of homologous proteins. Participants were given raw data and a sequence file and asked to identify the proteins and provide estimates on the FDR at the proteoform level. As part of this study, we tested a new submission system with a format validator running on a virtual private server (VPS) and allowed methods to be provided as executable R Markdown or IPython Notebooks. The task was perceived as difficult, and only eight unique submissions were received, although those who participated did well with no one method performing best on all samples. However, none of the submissions included a complete Markdown or Notebook, even though examples were provided. Future iPRG studies need to be more successful in promoting and encouraging participation. The VPS and submission validator easily scale to much larger numbers of participants in these types of studies. The unique ""ground-truth"" dataset for proteoform identification generated for this study is now available to the research community, as are the server-side scripts for validating and managing submissions.",2018,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Joon-Yong Lee"", ids = ""48173539""); list(name = ""Hyung-Won Choi"", ids = ""16310474""); list(name = ""Christopher M.

d32b62e60a2dc0ef02e21d6f3a4053a4bc5b32d1,Microarray test results should not be compensated for multiplicity of gene contents,"BackgroundMicroarray technology has enabled the measurement of comprehensive transcriptomic information. However, each data entry may reflect trivial individual differences among samples and also contain technical noise. Therefore, the certainty of each observed difference should be confirmed at earlier steps of the analyses, and statistical tests are frequently used for this purpose. Since microarrays analyze a huge number of genes simultaneously, concerns of multiplicity, i.e. the family wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR), have been raised in testing the data. To deal with these concerns, several compensation methodologies have been proposed, making the tests very conservative to the extent that arbitrary tuning of the threshold has been introduced to relax the conditions. Unexpectedly, however, the appropriateness of the test methodologies, the concerns of multiplicity, and the compensation methodologies have not been sufficiently confirmed.ResultsThe appropriateness was checked by means of coincidence between the methodologies' premises and the statistical characteristics of data found in two typical microarray platforms. As expected, normality was observed in within-group data differences, supporting application of t-test and F-test statistics. However, genes displayed their own tendencies in the magnitude of variations, and the distributions of p-values were rather complex. These characteristics are inconsistent with premises underlying the compensation methodologies, which assume that most of the null hypotheses are true. The evidence also raised concerns about multiplicity. In transcriptomic studies, FWER should not be critical, as analyses at higher levels would not be influenced by a few false positives. Additionally, the concerns for FDR are not suitable for the sharp null hypotheses on expression levels.ConclusionsTherefore, although compensation methods have been recommended to deal with the problem of multiplicity, the compensations are actually inappropriate for transcriptome analyses. Compensations are not only unnecessary, but will increase the occurrence of false negative errors, and arbitrary adjustment of the threshold damages the objectivity of the tests. Rather, the results of parametric tests should be evaluated directly.",2011,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tomokazu Konishi"", ids = ""3178765"")",bcb50c8eb8d43f6df8d5b6385d0475bb0d5793d7; 1050a1811f6e46b1a16b500ce51255a8d2630566; 2a709ea9e26caea71e7d749ca43bef6b9182c669; ccb6f23b2383ba9c420a92af0614a626d9157892; c59b18706967eb3a948e6e92baa1114a35d71b8a; 0f1ddd50f50532f7e77a2048ac673c7f2ec1d9a5; f4cd1dd2ea0b011d21bcdf5b1600cf2d732389a5; 2fca1cb85f5b54ea939df29a936dd28f74d14110; c514bc00e794d85cd5266648cb77191a1bf6d23d; 4cc68e6f10289d17e8da61837c91e9bcec9677aa; 466f338a4155a4d8562381d6f255baf004a01e2f,cfb8aa5a84f0528a7be508127ee9d6389b34e2d4; 5f4d510a19644d15e0f671f6f7f5b41908df50e6; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 7acbc26837aa8d7dfc34992e3aa12265f82e14ac; 67fd52280af7d0b42f79f5564a3bb9247b509eaf; 8f45f2549df91a55f460989b1fd24c8c4a6a3078; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; a7e66d7436849cbd19e6991d2c4d06fb06580a79; a5b76fa17917a8a2d07687e064c327a3056910a4; 3a09814039dc1b8ed55a4c54f8425b18b26b7abd; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 1c7ffc9b8da5873f06a3edc4448f80a01f174aeb; 245ae1bb44fdbcc43be9802af3303577d368742f; 5d3f2a98b1a5f3cb21ad46637c37eee9dcf50d74; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 081b4667c33a627fa9bdfbb8c18f4a7b4c9aad3c; b646e7164fb2e01dd288fedc48bd5511ad656b57; 792ab437ecafd8c5b4b5f77eeb6082917b97e1e9; 473aed5ddabee5daec75829b8e0e430da4e53019; a5d6e03ae9535351cb8eff79010d585138e54707; 6f8182d4b807f877a2e1102ffc95e4392d37a6d0; a68648acabb2ebf5982e99bd77b65acc178dd316; c1aa3c612e323acc33348c2a706cc7a12941412e; c07a8728a2b32bf0578b483d02bbfac60e37f57d; 4ca0de63909a704a8b02272daf46f88f50412dbe; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 1cb681fbb70383afb806d887b96a020503beb72a,BMC Systems Biology,5,S6 - S6

While physiological acclimatization of mammals to hypoxia is well studied, the variation in gene expression that underlies acclimatization is not well studied. We acclimatized inbred mice for 32 days to hypoxic conditions that simulated altitudes of 1400, 3000, and 4500 m. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to measure changes in steady-state abundance of mRNA in the livers of these mice. Mice exposed to more severe hypoxia (simulated altitude of 4500 m) were smaller in mass and had higher hematocrit than mice exposed to less severe hypoxia. ANOVA and false discovery rate tests indicated that 580 genes were significantly differentially expressed in response to chronic hypoxia. Few of these 580 genes have previously been reported to respond to hypoxia. In contrast, many of these 580 genes belonged to same functional groups typically respond to acute hypoxia. That is, both chronic and acute hypoxia elicit changes in transcript abundance for genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein amino acid phosphorylation, but the particular genes affected by the two types of hypoxia were mostly different. Numerous genes affecting the immune system were differentially expressed in response to chronic hypoxia, which supports recently proposed hypotheses that link immune function and hypoxia. Furthermore, our results discovered novel elevated mRNA abundance of genes involved in hematopoiesis and oxygen transport not reported previously, but consistent with extreme hematocrits found in hypoxic mice.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Monica M.

cba539e44ff6d4aaee802c9d23ee2282ba2d96b3,Each pregnancy linearly changes immune gene expression in the blood of healthy women compared with breast cancer patients,"Background
There is a large body of evidence demonstrating long-lasting protective effect of each full-term pregnancy (FTP) on the development of breast cancer (BC) later in life, a phenomenon that could be related to both hormonal and immunological changes during pregnancies. In this work, we studied the pregnancy-associated differences in peripheral blood gene expression profiles between healthy women and women diagnosed with BC in a prospective design.


Methods
Using an integrated system epidemiology approach, we modeled BC incidence as a function of parity in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) cohort (165,000 women) and then tested the resulting mathematical model using gene expression profiles in blood in a nested case-control study (460 invasive case-control pairs) of women from the NOWAC postgenome cohort. Lastly, we undertook a gene set enrichment analysis for immunological gene sets.


Results
A linear trend fitted the dataset precisely showing an 8% decrease in risk of BC for each FTP, independent of stratification on other risk factors and lasting for decades after a woman's last FTP. Women with six children demonstrated 48% reduction in the incidence of BC compared to nulliparous. When we looked at gene expression, we found that 756 genes showed linear trends in cancer-free controls (false discovery rate [FDR] 5%), but this was not the case for any of the genes in BC cases. Gene set enrichment analysis of immunologic gene sets (C7 collection in Molecular Signatures Database) revealed 215 significantly enriched human gene sets (FDR 5%).


Conclusion
We found marked differences in gene expression and enrichment profiles of immunologic gene sets between BC cases and healthy controls, suggesting an important protective effect of the immune system on BC risk.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eiliv Lund"", ids = ""143699426""); list(name = ""AurÃ©lie Nakamura"", ids = ""22853862""); list(name = ""Igor Snapkov"", ids = ""6748487""); list(name = ""Jean-Christophe Thalabard"", ids = ""46688767""); list(name = ""Karina Standahl Olsen"", ids = ""50349614""); list(name = ""Lars Holden"", ids = ""1847101""); list(name = ""Marit Holden"", ids = ""51325726"")",,0d3bbfd3521f6f4c5566a6f2d0c4464e4c453d5f; 22c169697c7696486a9b1de24d685f847fc95dba; db182e13ffda77761921e10766213a7f63d5327e; 71ef04c25f8456b28db5c48bb7c9c3b9d5eb43b8; 613682f660aa13f10a8babf9bdb9959f79e7e095; d0c3a9f80eb4d5a881fbfba8932f6fa70d8d8bad; 1d2cd9538f6ef07a87534eb3324a09e6bcf9597a; ff25e2c3f338857ab54d43e5b54e364fdc777d5f; 72bd71ba44c1f0e9eb7d14e965affa7044d9b5e5; a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 1c7bd3d1972af176bf1ae360c39f2a465bec5a54; 17beb7b147c3f6405bbd2d68816296ed028f5145; 2d50602e2a02b098c512e8c9a4b8c25bb79cea74; 4f437b02b79ebe8343bbb88a7eaa05a425e62327; 04ebe816cee3ec3c2111c8414d1a36bd300b0237; 151e403f14ea52460de66fd28aa3a8081b04624b; 885337bf3ce8b9bc595d00bdf84a3af5018cf719; 815db256f36518f78c768c8e9527e17491c54979; 6b5cc718b568554ade3850005bb6e76961ff83ed; 53b0d10ddbe32f163e11e5c71677621fc38f0245; 4c60c07bf86c99e468523eb661a74b4fae609947; d0a30ebef46160efd385cbd823d27f4e96c8d587; efac8948f286042a6d3c89aa834b4ef09edb3805; f4156695d66c699e8a84b8bd94e47ae110ee901b; b9374f78cbd11016006a5929e54c27da76e55ce8; a0dcaead129af54722e415f615f9f2aaabc49e62; e54beb27c3f9590f32f1a34c5d39d88572803f54; f6d98fd63704f60bdc4b228577067c60ba6fa4bc; dd46cb2ec8838e7bdd23db052ca123f416b35a97; 54810420accc9141460e47aa8d2d1ae04189365f; 3af045503abf81705fc1833aadf5db93a9be854c; eab9979ef9ede5d412395ecc8abf08a08b668617; b881a16a29d7bfed78f0be383bd2d57a1f8d22a0; 70ddbbd6b1708ec4f1bfe19769d5a03a8a235b11; f176c749084e48acf1645285840872cd37729829; bda24c6b42405156a3cef2648952a33413d0db52; 801e15e4a14ad21295cd1c93112f4c457ea1f8d1; ae4e50891059433643f240269b763f112cc6fd06; 3c8b47abe84a48d15ce8767ffda747fecceb4b51; e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; e3212edf1693edcc6ded8f57fb830ea3b7fac22b; f472969ac128c0523d23b15a04d0cc4f9aacfb8c,Clinical Epidemiology,10,931 - 940

It stems from the repeated use of the false discovery rate controlling the linear step-up procedure (sometimes called BH), and makes use of the critical constants iq/[(m + 1 - i(1 - q)], i = 1,..., m. Motivated by its success as a model selection procedure, as well as by its asymptotic optimality, we are interested in its false discovery rate (FDR) controlling properties for a finite number of hypotheses.

6f3c21b0923650015efca334e612604d0a9ab1eb,Fine-mapping IGF1 and prostate cancer risk in African Americans: the multiethnic cohort study.,"Genetic variation at insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has been linked to prostate cancer risk. However, the specific predisposing variants have not been identified. In this study, we fine-mapped the IGF1 locus for prostate cancer risk in African Americans. We conducted targeted Roche GS-Junior 454 resequencing of a 156-kb region of IGF1 in 80 African American aggressive prostate cancer cases. Three hundred and thirty-four IGF1 SNPs were examined for their association with prostate cancer risk in 1,000 African American prostate cancer cases and 991 controls. The top associated SNP in African Americans, rs148371593, was examined in an additional 3,465 prostate cancer cases and 3,425 controls of non-African American ancestry-European Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, and Native Hawaiians. The overall association of 334 IGF1 SNPs and prostate cancer risk was assessed using logistic kernel-machine methods. The association between each SNP and prostate cancer risk was evaluated through unconditional logistic regression. A false discovery rate threshold of q < 0.1 was used to determine statistical significance of associations. We identified 8 novel IGF1 SNPs. The cumulative effect of the 334 IGF1 SNPs was not associated with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.13) in African Americans. Twenty SNPs were nominally associated with prostate cancer at P < 0.05. The top associated SNP among African Americans, rs148371593 [minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.03; P = 0.0014; q > 0.1], did not reach our criterion of statistical significance. This polymorphism was rare in non-African Americans (MAF < 0.003) and was not associated with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.98). Our findings do not support the role of IGF1 variants and prostate cancer risk among African Americans.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Elena E. Giorgi"", ids = ""40290407""); list(name = ""Daniel O.

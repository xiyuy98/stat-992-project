f6ab0098c634b0b381959c7fefc20db59277adeb,Association between functional polymorphisms in genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathways and cutaneous melanoma risk.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have mainly focused on top significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), most of which did not have clear biological functions but were just surrogates for unknown causal variants. Studying SNPs with modest association and putative functions in biologically plausible pathways has become one complementary approach to GWASs. To unravel the key roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in cutaneous melanoma (CM) risk, we re-evaluated the associations between 47 818 SNPs in 280 MAPK genes and CM risk using our published GWAS dataset with 1804 CM cases and 1026 controls. We initially found 105 SNPs with P â‰¤ 0.001, more than expected by chance, 26 of which were predicted to be putatively functional SNPs. The risk associations with 16 SNPs around DUSP14 (rs1051849) and a previous reported melanoma locus MAFF/PLA2G6 (proxy SNP rs4608623) were replicated in the GenoMEL dataset (P < 0.01) but failed in the Australian dataset. Meta-analysis showed that rs1051849 in the 3' untranslated regions of DUSP14 was associated with a reduced risk of melanoma (odds ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.96, P = 0.003, false discovery rate = 0.056). Further genotype-phenotype correlation analysis using the 90 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines from Caucasians showed significant correlations between two SNPs (rs1051849 and rs4608623) and messenger RNA expression levels of DUSP14 and MAFF (P = 0.025 and P = 0.010, respectively). Gene-based tests also revealed significant SNPs were over-represented in MAFF, PLA2G6, DUSP14 and other 16 genes. Our results suggest that functional SNPs in MAPK pathways may contribute to CM risk. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Hongliang Liu"", ids = ""39298101""); list(name = ""Li-e Wang"", ids = ""46659192""); list(name = ""Zhensheng Liu"", ids = ""9071783""); list(name = ""Wei Vivien Chen"", ids = ""48993720""); list(name = ""Christopher I.

e719098eb1f135302c2c1c56f8ee09c8d87e5e87,Biological profiling of gene groups utilizing Gene Ontology.,"Increasingly used high throughput experimental techniques, like DNA or protein microarrays give as a result groups of interesting, e.g. differentially regulated genes which require further biological interpretation. With the systematic functional annotation provided by the Gene Ontology the information required to automate the interpretation task is now accessible. However, the determination of statistical significance of a biological process within these groups is still an open question. In answering this question, multiple testing issues must be taken into account to avoid misleading results. Here we present a statistical framework that tests whether functions, processes or locations described in the Gene Ontology are significantly enriched within a group of interesting genes when compared to a reference group. First we define an exact analytical expression for the expected number of false positives that allows us to calculate adjusted p-values to control the false discovery rate. Next, we demonstrate and discuss the capabilities of our approach using publicly available microarray data on cell-cycle regulated genes. Further, we analyze the robustness of our framework with respect to the exact gene group composition and compare the performance with earlier approaches. The software package GOSSIP implements our method and is made freely available at http://gossip.gene-groups.net/.",2005,Biology; Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nils BlÃ¼thgen"", ids = ""2508433"");

bc890cd58854edd1710f0565b3874e2c2c3c9899,High Throughput Screening of Co-Expressed Gene Pairs with Controlled False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Minimum Acceptable Strength (MAS),"Many exploratory microarray data analysis tools such as gene clustering and relevance networks rely on detecting pairwise gene co-expression. Traditional screening of pairwise co-expression either controls biological significance or statistical significance, but not both. The former approach does not provide stochastic error control, and the later approach screens many co-expressions with excessively low correlation. We have designed and implemented a statistically sound two-stage co-expression detection algorithm that controls both statistical significance (false discovery rate, FDR) and biological significance (minimum acceptable strength, MAS) of the discovered co-expressions. Based on estimation of pairwise gene correlation, the algorithm provides an initial co-expression discovery that controls only FDR, which is then followed by a second stage co-expression discovery which controls both FDR and MAS. It also computes and thresholds the set of FDR p-values for each correlation that satisfied the MAS criterion. Using simulated data, we validated asymptotic null distributions of the Pearson and Kendall correlation coefficients and the two-stage error-control procedure; we also compared our two-stage test procedure with another two-stage test procedure using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We then used yeast galactose metabolism data to illustrate the advantage of our method for clustering genes and constructing a relevance network.

615dfe4c12f04d4913c91516b62826a344ae8d3c,Gene variants of VAMP8 and HNRPUL1 are associated with early-onset myocardial infarction.,"OBJECTIVE
Identify gene variants associated with early-onset myocardial infarction (MI).


METHODS AND RESULTS
We tested 11 647 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with early-onset MI in a case-control study (study 1 200 cases, 262 controls). To reduce the number of false positives among the 666 SNPs that were nominally associated with early-onset MI (P<0.05) in study 1, we tested these SNPs in study 2 (434 cases, 504 controls). We found that 8 of the 666 SNPs were associated with early-onset MI in study 2 (P<0.05) and had the same risk alleles as in study 1. These 8 SNPs were then tested for association with early-onset MI in study 3 (187 cases, 434 controls). We found that a VAMP8 variant (P = 0.025; odds ratio [OR], 1.75; CI, 1.17 to 2.62) and an HNRPUL1 variant (P = 0.0043; OR, 1.92; CI, 1.28 to 2.86) were associated with early-onset MI (nominal P<0.05; false discovery rate <10%) and had the same risk alleles in all 3 studies.


CONCLUSIONS
Variants in 2 genes were associated with early-onset MI: VAMP8, which is involved in platelet degranulation, and HNRPUL1, which encodes a ribonuclear protein. The identification of these variants could improve understanding of disease mechanisms and suggest novel drug targets.",2006,Medicine,"list(name = ""Dov Shiffman"", ids = ""35434922""); list(name = ""Charles M Rowland"", ids = ""1829945""); list(name = ""Judy Z.

0c2429e0f7d84d2bf729af4386deda599f5a47a6,Association of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Genes with Psoriasis,"To the Editor: 
 
Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated and hyperproliferative disorder of the skin that affects 2â€“3% of the population. Psoriasis is associated with an increased incidence of several cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Davidovici et al., 2010). The association of these cardiovascular and metabolic diseases with psoriasis could be due to shared genetic risk variants, shared environmental triggers, activation of common inflammatory pathways, or a combination of these factors. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that some of the increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in psoriasis is derived from shared genetic risk factors. 
 
Using the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) Catalog (available at www.genome.gov/gwastudies and accessed in December 2011), we selected 363 SNPs that showed significant association with CAD, hypertension, body mass index (BMI), hyperlipidemia (total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels), or T2D. Selected SNPs met genome-wide significance (p < 5Ã—10âˆ’8) in at least two GWAS or were significant in the latest meta-analysis of GWAS. Additional SNPs or loci were also included based on the latest expert opinions (McCarthy, 2010; O'Donnell and Nabel, 2011; Peden and Farrall, 2011). Detailed information about the selected SNPs is provided in Table S1. 
 
We evaluated the selected cardiovascular and metabolic SNPs for association with psoriasis in four psoriasis GWAS cohorts: the GAIN cohort including 1368 psoriasis cases and 1348 controls (Nair et al., 2009), an unpublished psoriasis cohort from Sweden including 725 cases and 438 controls, a Washington University/University of California San Francisco cohort including 211 psoriasis cases and 502 controls (Liu et al., 2008), and the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) cohort including 2178 psoriasis cases and 5175 controls (Strange et al., 2010). Further details of the Swedish cohort are described in the Supplemental Methods. IMPUTE2 was used to impute the ungenotyped SNPs by using phase 3 HapMap and 1000 Genomes pilot project CEU haplotypes as a reference. SNPTEST was used to associate the imputed dosage for each SNP with psoriasis status separately in each study population with the adjustment of the first three principal components from an MDS analysis of population stratification. The association test results for these SNPs with relatively high confidence (PROPER_Info > 0.5) were then combined by meta-analysis with the META using inverse-variance method based on a fixed-effect model. The false discovery rate method was used to correct for multiple testing (FDR_q < 0.05). 
 
We first examined the associations between all selected SNPs and psoriasis status (Table 1 and Table S2). After adjusting for multiple testing with the false discovery rate method, seven SNPs were associated with psoriasis status (FDR_q < 0.05, Table 1). The alleles associated with increased risk of dyslipidemia (rs2247056, rs3177928, rs492602, and rs181362), increased blood pressure levels (rs805303, rs653178, and rs3184504), and increased CAD risk (rs3184504) were associated with increased risk of psoriasis (Table 1). The top three SNPs (rs2247056, rs3177928, and rs805303) were located in the HLA gene region which is a known psoriasis susceptibility locus. After further adjustment for the top psoriasis risk allele HLA-C*06:02 (determined by imputation as described in (Chen et al., 2012), the associations for rs2247056 and rs3177928 were mitigated (p = 0.06 and 0.07, respectively), while the association for rs805303 persisted (p = 0.005). Since multiple psoriasis risk alleles are identified in HLA loci (Chen et al., 2012), we cannot rule out the significant association for rs805303 is derived from linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other psoriasis HLA risk alleles. Interestingly, we identified 4 non-HLA SNPs with evidence of shared genetic risk between psoriasis and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases: rs492603 in FUT2, rs181362 in UBE2L3, and rs653178 and rs3184504 (in complete LD with each other) near or in SH2B3. FUT2 encodes an alpha-(1,2)fucosyltransferase that determines secretor status of blood group antigens on epithelial cells and in bodily secretions and has been recently associated with susceptibility to psoriasis and Crohnsâ€™s disease (Ellinghaus et al., 2012), type 1 diabetes (Smyth et al., 2011), primary sclerosing cholangitis (Folseraas et al., 2012), and norovirus infection (Carlsson et al., 2009). UBE2L3 encodes an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in cell proliferation and immune function and is associated with susceptibility to celiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis (Zhernakova et al., 2011), Crohnâ€™s disease (Fransen et al., 2010), and systemic lupus erythematosus (Wang et al., 2012). The adaptor protein encoded by SH2B3 plays pleiotropic signaling roles in regulating lymphocyte differentiation, induction of VCAM-1 and E-selectin on endothelial cells by TNF-Î±, and thrombus formation (Devalliere and Charreau, 2011), and thus might explain its dual role in susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases and endothelium-related cardiovascular diseases (Jin et al., 2012).

With a combined 4482 psoriasis cases and 7463 controls, our meta-analysis had 80% power to detect genetic variants with OR = 1.2 at a significance level alpha of 0.05, assuming 5% of population allele frequency. Given that many cardiovascular and metabolic trait SNPs have ORs less than 1.2, we sought to determine whether cardiovascular and metabolic risk SNPs could be having a real, but more subtle effect on psoriasis susceptibility. We therefore constructed a weighted gene risk score (wGRS) to investigate the aggregate effects of the risk alleles associated with cardiovascular and metabolic traits between psoriasis patients and controls. Prior studies have shown that such genetic risk scores, which estimate an individualâ€™s overall genetic burden, have increased ability to discriminate between cases and controls (Chen et al., 2011). The GRS were weighted according to the effect size of the risk alleles and a common set of SNPs were examined across all cohorts (see Supplemental Methods). A small but significant difference for the wGRS of CAD, total cholesterol levels, and TG levels was seen (p < 0.006 for adjusting for multiple testing of 8 traits, Table 2). The wGRS of total cholesterol levels did not reach significance after removing the top associated SNPs (rs3177928 and rs492602, p = 0.42, Table 1 and â€‹and2).2). No difference between psoriasis cases and controls was observed regarding the wGRS of hypertension, T2D, LDL cholesterol levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and BMI (Table 2).

Multiple cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities have been observed in psoriasis patients. Here we examined whether the co-manifestation of these conditions is a result of shared genetic factors. The data presented here suggest that patients with psoriasis are enriched for certain common genetic variants (HLA, FUT2, UBE2L3, SH2B3) that predispose to increased risk of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased CAD risk itself. Further evaluation of these genes and pathways may be important to elucidate whether particular subsets of psoriasis patients carry a higher burden of risk for the development of these cardiovascular and metabolic co-morbidities.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yingchang Lu"", ids = ""50028840""); list(name = ""Haoyan Chen"", ids = ""47666446""); list(name = ""Pernilla Nikamo"", ids = ""5667012""); list(name = ""Hui Qi Low"", ids = ""4003986""); list(name = ""Cynthia Newman Helms"", ids = ""34697051""); list(name = ""Mark Seielstad"", ids = ""1903402""); list(name = ""Jianjun Liu"", ids = ""120809903""); list(name = ""Anne M Bowcock"", ids = ""1971302""); list(name = ""Mona StÃ¥hle"", ids = ""3861037""); list(name = ""Wilson Liao"", ids = ""8524852"")",569c125910b74263528bef40e89e34d92fbab7f7; c0919b9b92ea4023cf366bb5f68c7fa4d271aff7; 77cb5119f832589b1950a121e55d5d23f801eacb; 8eeb0717006bba5acaf5a915d736709f11560bba; 35ddf04633e0473bbe3b6fd19337494a6cc7b059; 90132584d95e1606dd02b50d6fa1f7d1a704090b; d5ae635a695c1f1e94edc609505bec72a4f30d4d; 205a5151c3c7fed60e4e2bd8da216e7eb2956065; 6f6cb4679bbf13be5bf09e8448df7bed7d7c00e0; fce490de7570c22ec428ce921a53bae15aedd5df; 95d89d697c8cdbc1a11d4bfeb61c6a2fcf3fba21; f91a61d40284d4d9f7800b1cb98e558f3112c6d8; 2d64005e1865eafb38afb6300c8d8403d10bad7f; 4948023dd4d41e7afd6121ff2de622ac08d38bfc; e0852f717addc22e910c6f1fbdd761f26b3947d3; 202c4041f6493e41fb9a1acb20e2242a9b4407e0; 944fc336e4b2a7a2e85d4249a87f4bcbfb384fb8; 1ed864809937535ec988cc523b37a8fcca99b4eb; d68af1eda08752b38b68dc4b0b102324b573b95c; 3bdd907a3a573e817c8d1bca50080fe9df440f11; f58b625725e392b4becd5897e21f067e01d6a278; 698d604b8126224a6c5f7db1357df9b7240d01c2; ca5066baf37c04881a267ee04b2c3f27713b764d; f15df308bf8160cf0b1436d41795bf626db3cd5f; f0b257a19cd1fee373c65600b95244a85fe120f0; aff51611af84e8c1064e0dbc28c4de290c60a8a4; 5f207402737bbb205ad711b23bc140bafd2dd756; fb4bda7033e82e8664d6eea1d1bbbef1085c5ebd; daefd96516d79bb0cba53618a5eda54697d2fa7f,a34e21c5bf1c49b47d931f73cf7e7f5a95a9c6fc; df9b906b5c2ca1122f2359dc39bd6c060b4d139a; 68ba35b2ef2568e0874cdab6511526583b844c70; 09e6d84f8173c13a96820c4d08e418c73b85be1f; 18351d250e1900fdb36d86a7c723935760b425ae; d67f9b96fd3e4fc0043eb1a4db9901b02c3e5016; 1275b5732ae73132ca55283a337a34eaae7b9a62; afb06e44c956a44da4262f87a863e55bada65ebe; c6104b868fc1baf717070adbdbca09a0a113bf47; 66244832e1d0ad30408f18edff5e9ab5bc86807d; 6ef499791516f6e87874736f1ba2b5c50bc2d733; 3b0528b12ad9da2c5f4eef0050539a1c96950210; 183a49e695d653417bbfd74f08236fb73836ce00; 79ad016afda998d2ba2deb08abcd3b76fd21684e; 7ac133c5b0476eb98bdfed6728c8fbc1332a3fed; ac4e94c7349cf21a6c0afbc7724878b00336dcbd; 1d7439d599d11354a2987ead1aad0dd521978dae; 23954c70d374e7f6fe7ec2aa9daa65929b414ae7; a4834d5d528c7aa9f85f3356395b5492231b9b72; 23a7468137a18ed723d016102212af4fb03a34d6; 2880c6e404d399865a1a0ecadd5cc4d5cde3cd68; 6fdc08f8708718ee3edc03d2ab8cec5a60dabb3a; 9e0d8528dcec37861c86ab08f053245b613a06ef; 81f388c0d19348083783562e29360e1fd24f7264; 01ac9637763abc5370f0c11ce1f73dfe0af4cc7e; 1a7d6284777cf2db8457f730f94128fee35e4f72; 6d0320366e582da5c7dabbd4befb6eaa0c5f2a10; 3acd41eeafe82b68094fdf0a487d8781b01fb790; 9e18ce41e1feacbc7de48d2f66756a5b7f8a07da; b380df428e73a4f5f38bf93aac769761bdfd9aa5; 5f3cb60926606847af0ee7348a246f733d0445d8; 32e0267ce83bb139592e93f84f9e414f8980e6ff; c58e7c86a854efd8f1527621ab844f7673072261; 0dc2e1bbeb4b37028f4b1db6caf04d3bde71d64a; 1ca64d1a17f1c865164257e02e28cd3a96da4095; 1bdfddeaa5037d534bcabec72b3e112d768931f0; 97d7041ca3378045c475cf1069ec3e74130f18e9; e66d21b29dff35f618014e54d3cbf5362f11249b; 8fb3a1d0e60bffcf49139a1ae0eeab722a6b8604; 35ef277f5023e1a7787fc7e0bd245fd572adc59d; b77a86b4786666510a1372fecc0d1cc3c824f843; 3dd56c6a78413127ffdba8c8114ebd4c4dd7b876; 44391362cc0ac5db49f94263138e1dda580a5e72; db782c49927a28d73abf4f930ab9a26d2b60b228; 423df7d78cd7e556c7e7ef351a9081aa80496668; e7a1cc1446c4084d8447357a1f0f8d0b7fe73e3d; e97b35e23343b66b8c7017d681e9e38c592b2aa6; a8b905152ea6f2900f4a0658267f93f38fab3f24; a6acb2dd75fc523fe8b2c56b6f02c3d79d6a338d; 7fbf9e4a8919128263b6e4ed3d97a652c53766d8,The Journal of investigative dermatology,133,836 - 839
52de7a5e6e2d3e65407249f9901b19133d0e6cff,MEG Analysis of Neural Interactions in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"The aim of the present study was to explore the interchannel relationships of resting-state brain activity in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common mental disorders that develop in children. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals were recorded using a 148-channel whole-head magnetometer in 13 patients with ADHD (range: 8-12 years) and 14 control subjects (range: 8-13 years). Three complementary measures (coherence, phase-locking value, and Euclidean distance) were calculated in the conventional MEG frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Our results showed that the interactions among MEG channels are higher for ADHD patients than for control subjects in all frequency bands. Statistically significant differences were observed for short-distance values within right-anterior and central regions, especially at delta, beta, and gamma-frequency bands (p < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test with false discovery rate correction). These frequency bands also showed statistically significant differences in long-distance interactions, mainly among anterior and central regions, as well as among anterior, central, and other areas. These differences might reflect alterations during brain development in children with ADHD. Our results support the role of frontal abnormalities in ADHD pathophysiology, which may reflect a delay in cortical maturation in the frontal cortex.",2016,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Amine Khadmaoui"", ids = ""3394808""); list(name = ""Carlos GÃ³mez"", ids = ""49159123""); list(name = ""JesÃºs Poza"", ids = ""144458180""); list(name = ""Alejandro Bachiller"", ids = ""145589773""); list(name = ""Alberto FernÃ¡ndez"", ids = ""145092202""); list(name = ""Javier Quintero"", ids = ""144849261""); list(name = ""Roberto Hornero"", ids = ""1739934"")",4b8213d10d95d0a52c3f5a4b0ad447df9bb1c1be; 5af31e38eb17fd1c823c8ddf0cd95ebb7fed9c66; 2c1fc56e3b7a1c0e3d0b8eb2d9ba18ded70f53bc,5e1e2dc10e1a91e5cb8371dc01f4137a67d0fa7b; 62e26e3b638c898b6fdb32ebfaf6e8b47970bb36; 7529bec25508af23059ced123307f9b3c8ffbf70; c43c78bfbc53771ce3f3221a9d3c41c60f850e62; 48d9e9396c07846b500d9ea81f3f283ccc18695e; 226b53e4350d1cf8693f678570e9b9b785691b33; 4dd639537bd9f938b07821bba93ef7cbd7079629; 182e0cbde67bd70d76852f2a3c5465de998831de; 7035061c870ef14f1a8d24c28caf92215f2b4ae7; 464b9a487cdcd896b1d36ef1bb55d373e6cc9800; f3b5392a0391f23bb0cde05b30bef9b54c3b4bb3; a2f784f89c17391010a46422d9e6d8c88f9c2e94; 4bec833bcd0f8210dc3f27a289a5e3fa45a75d15; 5d386c85f0334da7639acc04915b9fc4743f79f4; e461feef65398c9c52f30f79bd14be02e30c32a9; 55b9297c8dc34a6ccd20802dac44510750b9e9dc; 02de255490a078f1fdf9e3e89f0a7c3d4a4cfb4e; 06c6d124f1d09485274ff5cc53b985c0b7af897e; 260662cac6555098a67583bfce74b2f4b8742934; 7aa6f6fde054ba92b9c9debe89a8c6b33da3611e; 4977756d2f23c07292d8d7ca28098bcd5bdf3f89; 95fe18cb21b5f380bb3ee341ee6d5008d869fef0; f77bd1cca88747da6b9433cbc4a626b6af4e6ad1; a9999d5e38c8a3a50e0ad179b29d2bf046304f69; a509f68bf686d9a058285c2967db13970f662937; d36e2d41828378bf801efd9ffbca5627a12db108; 756484537ff38229d104467af6b19bccba7ffc48; add899ddf663b8ae8e233e8b772d87b9ae5bed14; aa608f9a6037fc160d1cab9d5ea51e1dd99efac0; 385dabc7f47905c89519bdcc0d4bbd956b06551a; 40f37d4c45d2165f7678c7ddcdc8cfa6aa903cd9; 350b242223298ce94c27559c256f5a407a0e3813; edbad14926dc496d93ff60e7d7a2952f830d42cd; db29bb119b66fce8ceb92e7d2289070c9c42bab3; 961722bc29963f3b11600d0d10c233c4a11b4573; 072d9f88f86799fdd5e95f8fedbd34b5c7b3fd7d; 085cf36e4f76c17464b7ea6bd3727a8232fd427f; cc77bb29f9bc69eaf8656f3b94574b69b6ba7320; 5e7029517465c6f8843b28da594eb77f4ed32d19; d1dbad178c6d97b09190eb83e226a70d6461f6f1; fa97c2238a16e9226f386ecffe22095e3d3d9dff; 4352c8725468c919e41b4ce7fe4dec21ddf408d5; 5a03148f81317fbeb0429d01f8eb94b45d6bdfde; 64f957c18bfcfcf7040132f9ed40d35dfdf87d12; 56ee65e112496452a141919d153f621e4c1f320d; 34675ee631db768c33a1c8d7752c1f37b756075f; c48e50145bd1f80b281c124973e6bf587b5a9036; 77464f6990f886f815a63093a97ea6062a33b1ca,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2016,

We provide an online p-value calculation for SST, making it convenient for continuous monitoring, and extend our tests to online multiple testing settings by controlling the false discovery rate. We examine the empirical performance of the proposed tests and compare them with a state-of-art online test, named mSPRT using simulations and a real data.

b7e07e9b9bca4caff578db47e3ab91c62848fa2a,Evaluation of the performance of copy number variant prediction tools for the detection of deletions from whole genome sequencing data,"Background Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has increased in popularity and decreased in cost over the past decade, rendering this approach as a viable and sensitive method for variant detection. In addition to its utility for single nucleotide variant detection, WGS data has the potential to detect Copy Number Variants (CNV) to fine resolution. Many CNV detection software packages have been developed exploiting four main types of data: read pair, split read, read depth, and assembly based methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of each of these main approaches in detecting deletions. Methods WGS data and high confidence deletion calls for the individual NA12878 from the Genome in a Bottle consortium were the benchmark dataset. The performance of Breakdancer, CNVnator, Delly, FermiKit, and Pindel was assessed by comparing the accuracy and sensitivity of each software package in detecting deletions exceeding 1kb. Results There was considerable variability in the outputs of the different WGS CNV detection programs. The best performance was seen from Breakdancer and Delly, with 92.6% and 96.7% sensitivity, respectively and 34.5% and 68.5% false discovery rate (FDR), respectively. In comparison, Pindel, CNVnator, and FermiKit were less effective with sensitivities of 69.1%, 66.0%, and 15.8%, respectively and FDR of 91.3%, 69.0%, and 31.7%, respectively. Concordance across software packages was poor, with only 27 of the total 612 benchmark deletions identified by all five methodologies. Conclusions The WGS based CNV detection tools evaluated show disparate performance in identifying deletions â‰¥1kb, particularly those utilising different input data characteristics. Software that exploits read pair based data had the highest sensitivity, namely Breakdancer and Delly. Breakdancer also had the second lowest false discovery rate. Therefore, in this analysis read pair methods (Breakdancer in particular) were the best performing approaches for the identification of deletions â‰¥1kb, balancing accuracy and sensitivity.

Since these programs are developed by academic institutes independently, the lack of common standard makes the talks between them difficult. In this paper, we developed a software system based on workflow for ChIP data analysis, namely CTW (ChIP-Tool-Workflow). CTW is a java-based software platform, which provides a common development interface to integrate data and programs. At the moment, many data types and tools abstracted from CisGenome, MAT and QuEST are integrated. CTW is designed to meet all basic needs of ChIP data analyses, including visualization, data normalization, peak detection, false discovery rate computation, gene-peak association, and sequence and motif analysis. Because the interface developed is very general and flexible, new analysis tools can be integrated effectively as required. CTW implies an ideal environment for integrative Biological research.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yu Huang"", ids = ""40381181""); list(name = ""Jian Wang"", ids = ""37199479""); list(name = ""Bing Hu"", ids = ""145287638""); list(name = ""Xiao Mei Wei"", ids = ""47630230"")",,4567bfea9bfaa996683be0e6285821af51578b07; 842204e75e5b04df1b056c62f0c390cea314f13b; 7f9d6c228018259f01212e4b80917d8aa9ea52aa; 9e166741dd0208c186463f06b579fccf3bf27603; 1915d5dc782c65ab0666b9a9d805fd810080de57,Applied Mechanics and Materials,380-384,2569 - 2572
8ee8373dc5edca019a9e8cf934891e9cad105eb2,Gentle Introduction to the Statistical Foundations of False Discovery Rate in Quantitative Proteomics.,"The vocabulary of theoretical statistics can be difficult to embrace from the viewpoint of computational proteomics research, even though the notions it conveys are essential to publication guidelines. For example, ""adjusted p-values"", ""q-values"", and ""false discovery rates"" are essentially similar concepts, whereas ""false discovery rate"" and ""false discovery proportion"" must not be confused, even though ""rate"" and ""proportion"" are related in everyday language. In the interdisciplinary context of proteomics, such subtleties may cause misunderstandings. This article aims to provide an easy-to-understand explanation of these four notions (and a few other related ones). Their statistical foundations are dealt with from a perspective that largely relies on intuition, addressing mainly protein quantification but also, to some extent, peptide identification. In addition, a clear distinction is made between concepts that define an individual property (i.e., related to a peptide or a protein) and those that define a set property (i.e., related to a list of peptides or proteins).",2018,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas Burger"", ids = ""47235394"")",adea3bf85b4ce8e6e07a61f56512cc6a3a8334d5; 6be22dab1cedf4e9d421ce6371ede3af69e0d87b; cb7412b82747927aeb001fa09c8ff2c33f72d1b7; a719ebcdd02e7586a550fa2429cb4e70062d053a; 9b2c90450665786c545b6404aa4748b95daaa3a6,,Journal of proteome research,17 1,"

cc39e6b36637e8a6318fdf615f04be8e10780868,Genetic associations with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in HIV-1-infected youth: fine-mapping for the GC/DBP gene that encodes the vitamin D-binding protein,"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is often deficient (<12 ng/ml) or insufficient (<20 ng/ml) in youth living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (YLH). Based on evidence from multiple genome-wide association studies, we hypothesized that genetic factors associated with 25(OH)D deficiency should be readily detectable in YLH even when controlling for other known factors, including use of the antiretroviral drug efavirenz (EFV). Genotyping by bi-directional sequencing targeted 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the GC/DBP locus, with a focus on coding and regulatory variants, as well as those repeatedly reported in the literature. Three intronic SNPs (rs222016, rs222020, and rs222029) in a conserved haplotype block had unequivocal association signals (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.006). In particular, the minor allele G for rs222020 was highly unfavorable among 192 YLH (99 African-Americans and 93 others), as gauged by relatively low likelihood for 25(OH)D sufficiency at enrollment (odds ratio = 0.31, p = 9.0 Ã— 10(-4)). In a reduced multivariable model, race, season, latitude, body mass index, exposure to EFV, and rs222020-G were independent factors that collectively accounted for 38% of variance in the log10-transformed 25(OH)D concentration (p < 0.0001). Interaction terms were evident for rs222020-G Ã— season (p < 0.001), latitude Ã— season (especially fall and winter; p < 0.01), and race Ã— EFV use (p = 0.024). Overall, variance in serum 25(OH)D is substantially attributable to multiple factors, but the exact contribution of genetic and non-genetic factors can be obscured by partial overlaps and frequent interactions.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Travis R.

1a089f6d0f0ad2628098378f3661cc11272bbc74,De novo transcriptome sequencing and gene expression profiling of Magnolia wufengensis in response to cold stress,"BackgroundMagnolia wufengensis is a new species of Magnolia L. and has considerable ornamental and economic value due to its unique characteristics. However, because of its characteristic of poor low temperature resistance, M. wufengensis is hardly popularization and application in the north of China. Furthermore, the mechanisms of gene regulation and signaling pathways involved in the cold-stress response remained unclear in this species. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and compared the gene expression under the natural (25â€‰Â°C) and cold (4â€‰Â°C) conditions for M. wufengensis seedlings.ResultsMore than 46 million high-quality clean reads were produced from six samples (RNA was extracted from the leaves) and were used for performing de novo transcriptome assembly. A total of 59,764 non-redundant unigenes with an average length of 899â€‰bp (N50â€‰=â€‰1,110) were generated. Among these unigenes, 31,038 unigenes exhibited significant sequence similarity to known genes, as determined by BLASTx searches (E-value â‰¤1.0E-05) against the Nr, SwissProt, String, GO, KEGG, and Cluster of COG databases. Based on a comparative transcriptome analysis, 3,910 unigenes were significantly differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR]â€‰<â€‰0.05 and |log2FC (CT/CK)|â€‰â‰¥â€‰1) in the cold-treated samples, and 2,616 and 1,294 unigenes were up- and down-regulated by cold stress, respectively. Analysis of the expression patterns of 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the accuracy of the RNA-Seq results. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway functional enrichment analyses allowed us to better understand these differentially expressed unigenes. The most significant transcriptomic changes observed under cold stress were related to plant hormone and signal transduction pathways, primary and secondary metabolism, and photosynthesis. In addition, 113 transcription factors, including members of the AP2-EREBP, bHLH, WRKY, MYB, NAC, HSF, and bZIP families, were identified as cold responsive.ConclusionWe generated a genome-wide transcript profile of M. wufengensis and a de novo-assembled transcriptome that can be used to analyze genes involved in biological processes. In this study, we provide the first report of transcriptome sequencing of cold-stressed M. wufengensis. Our findings provide important clues not only for understanding the molecular mechanisms of cold stress in plants but also for introducing cold hardiness into M. wufengensis.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shixin Deng"", ids = ""6877369"");

b29ab7dcbded376755dcec9520b6cae54166b69e,Epigenetic (dys)regulation of Hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway in ovarian cancer by microRNA molecules,"Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies in the Western world. Its high death rate is a result of the fact that most patients (>60%) are diagnosed in advanced stage of the disease. Our experience with ovarian cancer so far came out from the research on genetic (mutations and polymorphisms) and epigenetic (promoter methylation) mechanisms of Hedghog-Gli signaling pathway in the development of various types of ovarian malignancies. The purpose of this study was to find out which Hedgehog-Gli (Hh-Gli) signaling pathway genes could be potential targets of microRNA molecules (miRNAs) differentially expressed in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, which is the most malignant type and most difficult to detect at an earlier stage. We conducted a miRNA profiling on 8 fresh-frozen high-grade serous ovarian cancer tissue samples using Agilent SurePrint Human miRNA Microarray Kit 8x60K which contains probes for 2, 549 human miRNAs represented in miRBase database (Release 21.0). In addition, 8 healthy Fallopian tube samples were used as a control tissue to find differentially expressed miRNAs, since this type of tissue is presumed origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Reade et al. J Obstet Gynaecol Can. 2014). Acquired miRNA expression data were analyzed using LIMMA and AgiMicroRna tools from R/Bioconductor software package. Resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing based on false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Furthermore, on-line DIANA Tools (diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr) were used to find which Hh-Gli pathway genes are experimentally proven or potential targets of observed differentially expressed miRNAs. Data filtration (IQR>0.1, FDR 0.58 and <-0.58) gave us a list of 55 miRNAs: 32 were up-and 23 were down-regulated in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Out of 47 genes which are involved in Hh-Gli pathway in humans (according to the KEGG Pathway hsa04340), 35 are known targets for 27 over-expressed observed miRNAs, while 22 genes are known targets for 16 under-expressed miRNAs. In addition, 28 genes are potential targets for 26 up-regulated miRNAs while 24 are potential targets for 19 down-regulated miRNAs in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Our results have highlighted several candidate miRNAs which we intend to verify and functionally connect to Hh-Gli pathway genes in our future research. Enlightening the interplay between miRNAs and Hh-Gli signaling pathway genes in serous ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis could give us new information for better therapeutic approaches and early prevention programs.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Petar OzretiÄ‡"", ids = ""8412687""); list(name = ""Hubert Hackl"", ids = ""49700947""); list(name = ""Robert BeluÅ¾iÄ‡"", ids = ""47643371""); list(name = ""Maja Sabol"", ids = ""78737649""); list(name = ""Diana Trnski"", ids = ""8179248""); list(name = ""Vesna Musani"", ids = ""7987565""); list(name = ""DrÅ¾islav KalafatiÄ‡"", ids = ""10672583""); list(name = ""Ivana Maurac"", ids = ""14440513""); list(name = ""Slavko OreÅ¡koviÄ‡"", ids = ""5130740""); list(name = ""Sonja Levanat"", ids = ""4287014"")",,,,,46
3f835dd67639cb10630633316b89e0081baae562,Sildenafil augments early protective transcriptional changes after ischemia in mouse myocardium.,"Recently, targeting cyclic-GMP specific phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) has attracted much interest in several cardiopulmonary diseases, in particular myocardial ischemia (MI). Although multiple mechanisms were postulated for these beneficial effects at cellular level, early transcriptional changes were unknown. The aim of present study was to examine gene expression profiles in response to MI after 24 h of ischemia in murine model and compare transcriptional modulation by sildenafil, a popular phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Mice were divided into four groups: Control sham (C), Sildenafil sham (S), Control MI (CMI) and Sildenafil MI (SMI). Sildenafil was given at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg intraperitoneally 30 min before LAD occlusion. cDNA microarray analysis of peri-infarct tissue was done using a custom cloneset and employing a looped dye swap design. Replicate signals were median averaged and normalized using LOWESS algorithm. R/MAANOVA analysis was used and false discovery rate corrected permutation p-values <0.005 were employed as significance thresholds. 156 genes were identified as significantly regulated demonstrating fold difference >1.5 in at least one of the four groups. 52 genes were significantly upregulated in SMI compared to CMI. For a randomly chosen subset of genes (9), microarray data were confirmed through real time RT-PCR. The differentially expressed genes could be classified into following groups based on their function: phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, apoptosis, differentiation, ATP binding. Our results suggest that sildenafil treatment might regulate early genetic reprogramming strategy for preservation of the ischemic myocardium.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ramesh Vidavalur"", ids = ""4141408""); list(name = ""Suresh Varma Penumathsa"", ids = ""6913029""); list(name = ""Mahesh Thirunavukkarasu"", ids = ""6634965""); list(name = ""Lijun Zhan"", ids = ""2595763""); list(name = ""Winfried Krueger"", ids = ""151484695""); list(name = ""Nilanjana Maulik"", ids = ""5190475"")",9de3d9acbdd946c1976d61eb0b04cbbd18717761; fd758b0ca24cca63f81715e38f857d8e5af63de7,,Gene,430 1-2,"

33a959647e8989651572e5db1c6fa15a3020ecd5,Differences in Gene-Expression Profiles in Breast Cancer between African and European-ancestry Women.,"African American (AA) women have an excess breast cancer mortality than European American (EA) women. To investigate the contribution of tumor biology to this survival health disparity, we compared gene expression profiles in breast tumors using RNA sequencing data derived from 260 AA and 155 EA women who were prospectively enrolled into the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS) and developed breast cancer during follow-up. We identified 59 genes (54 protein-coding genes and 5 long intergenic non-coding RNAs) that were expressed differently between EA and AA at a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01. A gene signature was derived with these 59 genes and externally validated using the publicly available Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from180 AA and 838 EA breast cancer patients. Applying C-statistics, we found that this 59-gene signature has a high discriminative ability in distinguishing AA and EA breast cancer patients in the TCGA dataset (C-index = 0.81). These findings may provide new insight into tumor biological differences and the causes of the survival disparity between AA and EA breast cancer patients.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jie Ping"", ids = ""47373232""); list(name = ""Xingyi Guo"", ids = ""2918190""); list(name = ""Fei Ye"", ids = ""46594787""); list(name = ""Jirong Long"", ids = ""153643354""); list(name = ""Loren Lipworth"", ids = ""107802430""); list(name = ""Qiuyin Cai"", ids = ""1832279""); list(name = ""William J.

16277db9962fcf91a52c853eb93d5fe6ed500727,The epigenetic signature of subcutaneous fat cells is linked to altered expression of genes implicated in lipid metabolism in obese women,"BackgroundObesity is associated with changes in fat cell gene expression and metabolism. What drives these changes is not well understood. We aimed to explore fat cell epigenetics, i.e., DNA methylation, as one mediator of gene regulation, in obese women. The global DNA methylome for abdominal subcutaneous fat cells was compared between 15 obese case (BMI 41.4â€‰Â±â€‰4.4Â kg/m2, meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD) and 14 never-obese control women (BMI 25.2â€‰Â±â€‰2.5Â kg/m2). Global array-based transcriptome analysis was analyzed for subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) from 11 obese and 9 never-obese women. Limma was used for statistical analysis.ResultsWe identified 5529 differentially methylated DNA sites (DMS) for 2223 differentially expressed genes between obese cases and never-obese controls (false discovery rate <5Â %). The 5529 DMS displayed a median difference in beta value of 0.09 (range 0.01 to 0.40) between groups. DMS were under-represented in CpG islands and in promoter regions, and over-represented in open sea-regions and gene bodies. The 2223 differentially expressed genes with DMS were over-represented in key fat cell pathways: 31 of 130 (25Â %) genes linked to â€œadipogenesisâ€ (adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰1.66â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’11), 31 of 163 (19Â %) genes linked to â€œinsulin signalingâ€ (adjusted Pâ€‰=â€‰1.91â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’9), and 18 of 67 (27Â %) of genes linked to â€œlipolysisâ€ (Pâ€‰=â€‰6.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’5). In most cases, gene expression and DMS displayed reciprocal changes in obese women. Furthermore, among 99 candidate genes in genetic loci associated with body fat distribution in genome-wide association studies (GWAS); 22 genes displayed differential expression accompanied by DMS in obese versus never-obese women (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0002), supporting the notion that a significant proportion of gene loci linked to fat distribution are epigenetically regulated.ConclusionsSubcutaneous WAT from obese women is characterized by congruent changes in DNA methylation and expression of genes linked to generation, distribution, and metabolic function of fat cells. These alterations may contribute to obesity-associated metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance in women.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Peter Arner"", ids = ""4212074""); list(name = ""Indranil Sinha"", ids = ""145463336""); list(name = ""Anders Thorell"", ids = ""3706893""); list(name = ""Mikael RydÃ©n"", ids = ""1810715""); list(name = ""Karin Dahlman-Wright"", ids = ""1398688912""); list(name = ""Ingrid Dahlman"", ids = ""5945266"")",f20df23f6cf45a4c3b12a91968d07e6ea4e8b447; 3eac6a963ad99914385a915222ed467057aae6e3; f594691e563e3167675b6efb1965c2bba009f200; 227f28f10be0ab77f59573484d03ec023c576646; 3954f2eddefad5016b42fbc07267ce8fb5349b87; 8f14cad1be18d7805e377ae76899a0edbe2eb2d2; f60cbc283490d6e6327a4df6c08e580c365608d4; 3b19a58be17b763f70d0e760c56132d1e1b26bb5; e4a86bcee28972af0b7eb7efd715be19ddc894cf; dc45459532555a3129270247ad1b395e408acfe9; 31eb19d5a4b46883961a42d423a71363022817e1; 881a86d518f54ec0f05a602164c35da5e8dec4d6; f0008005cc0a45be07188a2cb9764106f223e553; 41f4d0ae9e48577d2b7fa0756f13b561c9253896; 11c5a36c7654799c95d0b2d3f9ab03268ec096e6; 4741da2fa544b6dd810df30cff58f1112dc2b064; 21072bbe899701063251625dca6c8d498891e690; 0d93c0f95e730e4c30e41d6d59da1bf88bca2fd0; c57986e2865a33e902caea15a4db8d25a608ad00; 341d027c1a3a80ba5b7d123138fb94ef75d1a9de; 99edd69d6af87d44967c455db90d409b58ec485a; dfb95e2af420f98944e9cba23f638ed0b59f8fce; 3bb415ae02720fcce334d02be9ec27526d8f1ea9; a88418aa8ebbb150f44a1613a414f1b300da397c; 7fd29b2c79b6c3158d23bfa7a473943ed163775b; fed31e06d47aebcc81258a5e1d8ed301342af3e1; 4e4ddb5a15e678d15ef2f087960095e295ba8bf6; 448e051b03bc94017177be46ffc3fe7e6cb27ebc,d1e9ad65f6f7de0e27adf4c72ba2e2ad70308a8f; 753447af50cc40fa31a9c5cd06258d7651d782a7; 2bbd98012f6aee6dcd6fcdb00375334a33d1bc87; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 55750c7c5376818326daed31e7f63bf4b68f1519; cf6312de39796f94b8607da718aa516942024925; 48549513d859f2dfc4b359d80e4c12b83ca5175f; b5c944e5d11a89b811d1b282c33ff558d1261e73; 987dc4f1c871c25e8cdd255874f6d5729626a885; 266788211bf9f2013f9dfee5406434f6a99747b1; b2664e26ecab67875037f7ee90e02db4c310c4df; 08b47762f795faa7fb6313fd92712d06eb67cdbe; 1d90eb4731d10fdc8ad47828e265313221778dea; 329ad99dcd54ff7a921febaa03e91a0947c42da7; c7e6d7b8733bf66072db0c20fdac5dfdf95eee23; bbfb26b3e6595ea1518d82d712b2da08b5c48472; 3fa9c1fa6fb4f5abb99d800c450e60a1f24bca44; 9cc442ea53a4576063863a97cd83330421e8ab26; 7d996ae76798cc9e39dfb7d024f4b08e4b17b3f5; 13db2e126bb91ef3835f4369d2099b42c3a8f07f; 96b4d113ce2917a6ba0e879df36fbb57077d3a24; 8807dc43a6fbf05dd33d437e502f74bb0b9f4aec; 8fa22a3b5344b8ddc28aca068bd70c35ad1a20a1; 954f1f12771e9a576cf887e6ed8b016ef1a30ca5; b4a14138a322bc667a9e06f89a7f68a5f5d9e333; a125584b8d7d7a5be27e3f0e32a79dcec8afe08d; 11b05cd6e7ddcff579ad158d389de8a7c45bb4fb; d67f9b96fd3e4fc0043eb1a4db9901b02c3e5016; c7e34e2a1afdf6a5648c010a6b7a543d04a5e5d4; a618b1a732888bb06af42bbd09a8fb662bbe1b16; 6da7d2bf3f0e4af7b53e1f1d31418a92024f5bb7; c4a7b7d89dfc0fc9cfa887d807153418c5ad333d; 5a0a53df5243f4b665503cd021eab037c28f00ae; c422492cd226524e02bcaac0d13294ab0f233698; b8749d6c0629de5aca78722d7eadedb11ae45d1a; 7728001b38967b11d227ad8cbf3f334e97416207; 59db91218ad136da3ade1d80f7cd1f1b6bca197b,Clinical Epigenetics,7,

Peptide identification using database searching was optimized for ETD fragment spectra to obtain the maximum number of identifications at equivalent false discovery rates (1.0%) in the evaluation of both fragmentation techniques. In the database search of the CID MS/MS data, the mass tolerance was set to the well-established 0.3 Da window, whereas for ETD data, it was widened to 1.1 Da to account for hydrogen-rearrangement in the radical-intermediate of the peptide precursor ion. To achieve a false discovery rate comparable to the CID results, we increased the significance threshold for peptide identification to 0.001 for the ETD data. The ETD based analysis yielded about 74% of all peptides and about 78% of all proteins compared to the CID-method.

5696355a7004dc2d2cdbeea0af29cad9276518b9,OR23 HLA class II genes correlate with protective neutralizing antibody titers in a dengue vaccine efficacy trial,"Aim A tetravalent, live attenuated dengue vaccine demonstrated efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in several clinical trials in Asia and Latin America. Efficacy differed based on infecting serotypes, presence of pre-existing dengue neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers and age. HLA class II molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells mediate CD4+ T cell stimulation of antibody production by B cells involved in vaccine-induced responses. We hypothesized that the differences in observed vaccine efficacy could be due to variation in NAb immune responses in conjunction with host HLA class II genes. Methods Samples were available from a subset of subjects that took part in the first tetravalent dengue vaccine efficacy trial conducted in Thailand. DNA was extracted from 335 saliva samples and HLA genotyping was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of full-length genes. A panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs) was genotyped to assess population stratification. Serotype-specific NAb titers were measured by plaque-reduction neutralization test 28â€¯days after last injection. The association of NAb titers and HLA class II on dengue infection was tested by logistic regression. Linear regression was used to test association of HLA class II alleles with NAb levels after accounting for sex, age, and serotype as covariates. A minimal false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons, with a two-sided p-value Results NGS identified 197 HLA class I and II alleles in the Thai Dengue vaccine trial. AIMs analysis did not identify population stratification comparing cases and controls. Magnitude of NAb levels post vaccination was significantly higher in the presence of HLA-DRB1*11 (pâ€¯=â€¯0.002, qâ€¯=â€¯0.08). HLA-DPB1*03:01 and *05:01 presence correlated with pre-existing NAb titers in the placebos (pâ€¯=â€¯0.005, qâ€¯=â€¯0.09; pâ€¯=â€¯0.001, qâ€¯=â€¯0.04). We did not observe a direct effect of HLA on dengue infection in either the placebo or treatment arm. Conclusions These findings suggest that specific HLA class II alleles modulate protective NAb titers in dengue infection. This is an exploratory study to identify signals to replicate in other dengue vaccine clinical studies. Understanding this HLA class II mechanism will enable improved vaccine design.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Aviva Geretz"", ids = ""6058673""); list(name = ""Shida Shangguan"", ids = ""91716563""); list(name = ""Christopher Bryant"", ids = ""145178008""); list(name = ""Philip K Ehrenberg"", ids = ""6514562""); list(name = ""Merlin L.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between CT imaging phenotypes, patient survival, and known genetic markers.MethodsA retrospective study was performed with 66 patients with surgically resected ICC. Pre-surgical CT images of ICC were assessed by radiologists blinded to tumor genetics and patient clinical data. Associations between qualitative imaging features and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were performed with Cox proportional hazards regression and visualized with Kaplanâ€“Meier plots. Associations between radiographic features and genetic pathways (IDH1, Chromatin and RAS-MAPK) were assessed with Fisherâ€™s Exact test and the Wilcoxon Rank sum test where appropriate and corrected for multiple comparisons within each pathway using the False Discovery Rate correction.ResultsThree imaging features were significantly associated with a higher risk of death: necrosis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.95 95% CI 1.44â€“6.04, pÂ =Â 0.029), satellite nodules (HR 3.29, 95% CI:1.35â€“8.02, pÂ =Â 0.029), and vascular encasement (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.28â€“5.41, pÂ =Â 0.029). Additionally, with each increase in axial size, the risk of death increased (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03â€“1.26, pÂ =Â 0.029). Similar to findings for OS, satellite nodules (HR 3.81, 95% CI 1.88â€“7.71, pÂ =Â 0.002) and vascular encasement (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.24â€“4.06, pÂ =Â 0.019) were associated with increased risk of recurrence/death. No significant associations were found between radiographic features and genes in the IDH1, Chromatin or RAS-MAPK pathways (pÂ =Â 0.63â€“84).ConclusionThis preliminary analysis of resected ICC suggests associations between CT imaging features and OS and DFS.

96984520882157c35031477730026e4ed2a69f4f,Significant Prognostic Features and Patterns of Somatic TP53 Mutations in Human Cancers,"TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in human cancers. Numerous retrospective studies have related its mutation and abnormal p53 protein expression to poor patient survival. Nonetheless, the clinical significance of TP53 (p53) status has been a controversial issue. In this work, we aimed to characterize TP53 somatic mutations in tumor cells across multiple cancer types, primarily focusing on several less investigated features of the mutation spectra, and determine their prognostic implications. We performed an integrative study on the clinically annotated genomic data released by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Standard statistical methods, such as the Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression, were used. This study resulted in several novel findings. They include the following: (1) similar to previously reported cases in breast cancer, the mutations in exons 1 to 4 of TP53 were more lethal than those in exons 5 to 9 for the patients with lung adenocarcinomas; (2) TP53 mutants tended to be negatively selected in mammalian evolution, but the evolutionary conservation had various clinical implications for different cancers; (3) conserved correlation patterns (ie, consistent co-occurrence or consistent mutual exclusivity) between TP53 mutations and the alterations in several other cancer genes (ie, PIK3CA, PTEN, KRAS, APC, CDKN2A, and ATM) were present in several cancers in which prognosis was associated with TP53 status and/or the mutational characteristics; (4) among TP53-mutated tumors, the total mutation burden in other driver genes was a predictive signature (P <.05, false discovery rate <0.11) for better patient survival outcome in several cancer types, including glioblastoma multiforme. Among these findings, the fourth is of special significance as it suggested the potential existence of epistatic interaction effects among the mutations in different cancer driver genes on clinical outcomes.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wensheng Zhang"", ids = ""36500979""); list(name = ""Andrea Edwards"", ids = ""39537858""); list(name = ""Erik K.

8641c2d4b615029786403f6e211cecd24715bd3a,OP0045 Adverse event reporting rates and placebo/standard-of-care-arm acr responses vary by region in rheumatoid arthritis trials,"Background Clinical trials are increasingly globalised, with more trials conducted in Asia, Latin America, and the Russian Federation and Eastern Europe (RFEE).1 Adverse event (AE) reporting rates and placebo (or standard-of-care-arm) response may differ by geographic region and level of economic development2â€“4; efficacy and safety may not be generalizable across regions. This potential heterogeneity and its implications for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) trials have not been studied in detail. Objectives To assess potential regional differences in rates of ACR responses and AE reporting using patient-level data (PLD) from RA trials in the TransCelerate initiative.5 Methods We obtained PLD for all 17 RA trials available through TransCelerate as of August 2017 and analysed data from 7 trials with geographic information available (NCT01198002, NCT01202760, NCT01202773, NCT01404585, NCT00605735, NCT00048581, NCT00647270). We grouped patients by region and evaluated differences in demographics, AE reporting rates, and ACR response. Pairwise comparisons were made between regions using Fisherâ€™s exact test, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. All patients were included in analyses of AE reporting. Only patients with data sufficient to calculate ACR scores were included in analyses of ACR response. Demographics for patients in each region are shown in table 1. Results The lowest rates of AE reporting and ACR50 response were seen in RFEE. The highest rate of ACR20 response was seen in Asia. After FDR correction, significantly lower 12â€‰week and 52â€‰week AE reporting rates were seen in RFEE than in Asia, Latin America, or the United States. Only the ACR50 response difference between RFEE and Latin America survived FDR correction; however, ACR20 rates in Asia remained significantly higher than in RFEE and the United States (table 2). Conclusions Patient-level data from placebo arms in the TransCelerate initiative revealed significant regional differences in AE reporting rates and ACR50/ACR20 response rates. Differences in Latin America, RFEE, and Asia were especially notable; future patient populations from these regions may show distinct efficacy/safety profiles regardless of treatment. Given ongoing globalisation of clinical trials, country- and region-specific treatment patterns, patient populations, and safety issues should be explored to avoid misguided inferences across regions. Capping recruitment by region to balance these factors may be warranted. References [1] Drain PK, et al. Nat Rev Drug Discov2014;13:166â€“7. [2] Contopoulos-Ioannidis D, et al.

4b3d8a2de6afdcdada8207b1586fddbc8281fa8b,122 Use of a day-14 embryonic array to study the elongation phase of the bovine embryo.,"In cattle, more than 30% of embryonic losses observed after artificial insemination (AI) have an early origin, coincident with a marked elongation of the trophoblast which occurs before implantation, between the 13th and 19th days of pregnancy. During this exponential growth phase, physiological interactions essential for pregnancy are established between the embryo and the uterus. Our work focuses on the identification of transcripts that regulate this key developmental period in several domestic species. For that, we generated a nylon membrane that contained 1920 gridded inserts originating from a Day-14 bovine embryo cDNA library (dbEST ID.15979; Hue et al., in preparation). Gene expression profiles in trophoblasts of increasing sizes were compared using ovoid (10â€“18-mm), tubular (50â€“60-mm), and early filamentous (140â€“150-mm) stages as complex probes. Trophoblasts were collected and immediately snap-frozen. RNA extractions were performed using RNAplus (Quantum Appligene, Illkirch 67402, France). Due to the scarce amount of mRNA per embryo, amplified material was used to hybridize the array. For that, antisense-RNA (aRNA) and cDNA were generated starting from 1 Î¼g of total RNA, as described by the MessageAmp aRNA kit instructions (Ambion, Rusin, TX 78744, USA) and according to Revel et al. (1995 Zygote 3, 241â€“250). Five hundred nanograms of aRNA or cDNA were random-primed and labelled with 33P-alpha-dATP [aRNA, according to the procedure of Decraene et al. 1999 BioTechniques 27, 962â€“966; cDNA using the Atlas SMART Probe Amplification kit, (Clontech, Osyme, Saint Quentin Yvelines 78053, France)]. For each protocol, two probes were generated independently and each of these probes was hybridized to four identical membranes according to Clontech instructions. These were then exposed to phosphoscreens and scanned after 7 days. Quantifications were done using ImaGene 5.1 (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA 90245, USA) and statistically analyzed with the AnovArray package freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.jouy.inra.fr/stat/AnovArray (Piot et al. 2004 Bioinformatics, submitted). Reproducibility of the two protocols used to amplify material (aRNA and cDNA) was confirmed by slot blot quantifications before labelling. The hybridization profiles generated for each protocol (8 membranes per stage) were also highly reproducible (0.95 < r < 0.97), allowing a global statistical analysis with the AnovArray package. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), including the correction for False Discovery Rate (FDR < 0.05), led to the identification of several bovine ESTs with unknown function that are differentially expressed during the rapid phase of trophoblastic elongation. Since genes, already known to be involved during elongation (IFN tau, Kunitz inhibitor), were also found differentially expressed in this study, this genomic approach using amplified complex probes is reliable to search for new markers of early developmental stages in cattle. Additionally, a thorough analysis of those markers may define them as interesting tools to assess the quality of embryonic development after AI, IVF (in vitro fertilisation), or SNT (somatic nuclear transfer).

95059f142ffe67c720bd0a51b576bb5f929f64f4,Asymmetric Structural Connectivity of Default-mode Network : an integrated study of fMRI and probabilistic DTI,"Introduction Default-mode network (DMN) of resting rhythm has been detected by utilizing BOLD-based fMRI at both 1.5T and 3T field strength (Gusnard et al, 2001; Yeh et al, 2005). And DMN spatial template of human brain has been constructed for the optimal solution for the automatic detection of default networks using brain fMRI studies (Lin et al 2008). DMN spatial template showed precuneus and posterior cingulate areas (labeled as PC) with the highest reproducibility, as indicated by previous deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET, Raichle et al 2001). The structural connectivity of DMN was characterized by probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging (pDTI) for illustrating the DMN asymmetry of bilateral cingulum. Subjects and Methods (1) Constructing spatial template of resting DMN An fMRI database of sixty right-handed subjects (genderand age-matched, age: 32 +/7 years old) was constructed for mapping the spatial template of DMN. Imaging studies of resting state were obtained with eye fixation. Images were acquired using a 3T Medspec S300 system (Bruker GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with an actively shielded gradient coil and a quadrature transceiver of head. Image sequences included (1) single-shot echo planar images of fMRI (64x64 matrix, voxel size = 3.6x3.6x6 mm, 20 slices, TR/TE=2000/50 milliseconds, repetition number (NR) = 200) and structural image of MDEFT (256x256x128 matrix, voxel size = 0.98x0.98x1.5 mm). Processing of DMN spatial template included (1) preprocessing of individual data sets using SPM2 (Functional Imaging Laboratory, UCL, UK) was applied for spatial normalization; (2) Group ICA was applied to construct the spatial template of DMN using GIFT (Calhoun et al, 2001) of informax ICA (Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, USA) with fixed component number of 50 by MDL (minimum description length); (3) temporal course of DMN was derived for each individual from GIFT as the regressor for GLM estimation after co-registration/normalization to MNI T1 template and smoothing of 8x8x8 mm in SPM2. Group analyses using two-level statistical evaluation of random-effect analysis was performed for DMN template of 60 subjects (DMN-60) with statistical criteria of p 0 for the second level with correction of false discovery rate (FDR). (2) Probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging of DMN The other 22 right-handed normal subjects (genderand age-matched, age: 34 +/6 years old) received anatomical MRI [GE SignaExcite 1.5T system, T1-weighted, 3D spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) pulse sequence, TR=8.5ms, TE=1.8ms, matrix size=256x256x124, voxel size = 1.02 x 1.02 x1.5mm], and DTI [1.5T SignaExcite, spin-echo-based diffusion-weighted EPI sequence, TR=17000 ms, minimal TE, matrix size = 128x128, NEX= 6, b-value=1000sec/mm, 13 directions, voxel size = 2.0x2.0x2.2mm]. Five regions of interest (ROIs) were derived from DMN template as right PC, left PC, medial prefrontal area (MF), right parietal lobule (PL) and left PL for DTI probabilistic tractography. All tractographies applied FSL ProbTrack [FMRIBâ€˜s Software Library, version 4.1.4, (Behrens, T.E. et al 2003), including eddy current correct, motion correction, parameter fitting of diffusion tensors and modeling of diffusion parameters with considering crossing fiber as eight. Exclusion masks, including corpus callosum and inter hemispheric plane, were applied to clarify structural asymmetry. Penetration maps of 22 subjects presented the reproducibility with the probabilistic cutoff of 0.16%. Results Spatial correlates of DMN mainly involved bilateral posterior medial parietal (Brodmann area 31, BA31), bilateral posterior lateral parietal, ventral medial prefrontal and dorsal medial prefrontal cortices (orange areas in Figure 1). Penetration maps showed the limited structural connectivity within each ROIs. For the structural connectivity between bilateral PC and MF, asymmetry of bilateral cingulum was noted as 2.4-fold higher reproducibility in right cingulum (the highest reproducibility as 86% and 36% for right and left cingulum cortices, respectively). Connectivity between right PC/right PL and left PC/left PL was demonstrated as red and blue labels with similar reproducibility (56%) in Figure 1.",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""T-C Yeh"", ids = ""35910068"")",,,,,

Gold standard for the location of seeds on TRUS data were obtained with the guidance of the complete reconstruction of the seed locations from multiple C-arm fluoroscopy views and used in the creation of the training set. We designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that worked on 3D cubical sub-regions of the TRUS images, that will be referred to as patches, representing seed, non-seed within a needle track and non-seed elsewhere in the images. The models were trained with these patches to detect the needle track first and then the individual seeds within the needle track. A leave-one-out cross validation approach was used to test the model on the data from eight of the patients, for whom accurate seed locations were available from fluoroscopic imaging. The total inference time was about 7 min for needle track detection in each patient's image and approximately 1 min for seed detection in each needle, leading to a total seed detection time of less than 15 minutes. Our seed detection algorithm achieved 78Â±8% precision, 64Â±10% recall and 70Â±8% F1_score. The results from our CNN-based method were compared to manual seed localization performed by an expert. The CNN model yielded higher precision (lower false discovery rate) compared to the manual method. The automated approach requires little modification to the current clinical setups and offers the prospect of application in real time intraoperative dosimetric analysis of the implant.",2019,Physics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maryam Afsari Golshan"", ids = ""40241102""); list(name = ""Davood Karimi"", ids = ""2130813""); list(name = ""Sara Mahdavi"", ids = ""122613770""); list(name = ""Julio Lobo"", ids = ""144658314""); list(name = ""Michael Peacock"", ids = ""39486932""); list(name = ""Septimiu E.

We investigate a utomating optical follow-up of XCS cluster candidates using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (S DS ) public archive, concentrating on 42 XMM observations that overlap the First Data Re lease of the SDSS. Confining ourselves to the inner 11 arcminutes of the XMM field-of-v iew gives 637 unique X-ray sources across a 3.09 deg region with SDSS coverage. The log Nâ€“logS relation indicates survey completeness to a flux limit of around 1 Ã— 10 erg s cm (in the 0.5-2.0 keV band). We have used the SDSS data in a variety of ways. First, we have c rossorrelated XMM point sources with SDSS quasars, finding 103 unique matches f rom which we determine a 90% confidence matching radius of 3.8 arcseconds. Using this matching radius we make immediate identifications of roughly half (214 of 520) of all XM M point sources as quasars (159) or stars (55). These objects will be a powerful resourc e for non-cluster studies. Second, we have estimated the typical error on SDSS-determined phot ometric cluster redshifts to be â‰ƒ 5% for relaxed systems, and â‰ƒ 11% for disturbed systems, by comparing photometric redshifts to spectroscopic redshifts for eight previously-kn ow clusters ( 0.183 < zspec < 0.782). The measured level of error for disturbed systems may be prob lematic for X-ray and Sunyaevâ€“ Zelâ€™dovich cluster surveys relying on photometric redshif ts alone. Third, we use the False Discovery Rate methodology to select 41 XMM sources (25 point-l ike, 16 extended) statistically associated with SDSS galaxy overdensities. Of the 16 extend ed sources, 5 are new cluster candidates and 11 are previously-known clusters ( 0.044 < z < 0.782). There are 83 extended X-ray sources not associated with SDSS galaxy overdensitie s, which are our strongest candidates for new high-redshift clusters. We highlight two prev iously-knownz > 1 clusters that were rediscovered as extended sources by our wavelet-based detection software. These results show that the SDSS can provide useful automate d follow-up to X-ray cluster surveys, especially with regard to the rejection of point-s ource contamination, but cannot provide all the optical follow-up necessary for X-ray clust er surveys.

ac4733cd4be09622e3a46a67801bc7e2b5ae5c5b,Controlling the False Discovery Rate for the Sam Method,"The Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM) proposed by Tusher, Tibshirani and Chu (2001) is nowadays a standard statistical procedure for detecting differentially expressed genes in microarray studies. Given a threshold â–³ of the deviation between a t-like statistic and its empirical expectation, an estimated false discovery rate (FDR) is reported in additional to the conclusion of significance. However, the deviation between the statistic and its expectation is not easy to interpret as a conventional error measure. In practice, researchers often found the determination of the â–³ is quite difficult. SAM suggests to try several different â–³'s in the analysis and use the result which is correspondent to an adequate FDR level. In this paper, we propose a SAM-based approach, in which, instead of â–³, the level of per-comparisonwise error rate (PCER) is specified. The new approach involves the kernel quantile estimation method in resampling data to improve the efficiency of the sample quantiles. To control the FDR of a conclusion, the BH step-up multiple testing procedure is utilized. Simulation studies are conducted to show that the proposed approach achieves adaptive control of FDR in various settings. The proposed approach is demonstrated with a real microarray dataset.",2006,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Huey-miin Hsueh"", ids = ""38211103""); list(name = ""Chen-An Tsai"", ids = ""2113587"")",,,,44,364-381
ae50bd10783771f268b7e65a838fa4b6ff6416f2,Local Segmentation by Large Scale Hypothesis Testing - Segmentation as Outlier Detection,"We propose a novel and efficient way of performing local image segmentation. For many applications a threshold of pixel intensities is sufficient. However, determining the appropriate threshold value poses a challenge. In cases with large global intensity variation the threshold value has to be adapted locally. We propose a method based on large scale hypothesis testing with a consistent method for selecting an appropriate threshold for the given data. By estimating the prominent distribution we characterize the segment of interest as a set of outliers or the distribution it self. Thus, we can calculate a probability based on the estimated densities of outliers actually being outliers using the false discovery rate (FDR). Because the method relies on local information it is very robust to changes in lighting conditions and shadowing effects. The method is applied to endoscopic images of small particles submerged in fluid captured through a microscope and we show how the method can handle transparent particles with significant glare point. The method generalizes to other problems. This is illustrated by applying the method to camera calibration images and MRI of the midsagittal plane for gray and white matter separation and segmentation of the corpus callosum. Comparing this segmentation method with manual corpus callosum segmentation an average dice score of 0.88 is obtained across 40 images.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sune Darkner"", ids = ""1762901""); list(name = ""Anders Bjorholm Dahl"", ids = ""2253200""); list(name = ""Rasmus Larsen"", ids = ""145726197""); list(name = ""Arnold Skimminge"", ids = ""2056237""); list(name = ""Ellen Garde"", ids = ""3657033""); list(name = ""Gunhild Waldemar"", ids = ""8401621"")",,898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 4dafbbc0cd8eb3e9967dd6b8bfce216a4dd3c1fc; b2a80d74451e4d3d0e87600310878cbb403631cc; a8cb5fafb618f01911b5fad271daf45fe0fbf5d2; c702415fede5f2d8470880b0f83ed03894439554; 1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef; 86b158f6052b4ffbb35818d31d20692a2579df5b; d8d3e6d95b60ec6ac8f91f42a6914a87b13a6bc1; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 4fae4bfc940b3b7bb6820c2dff8156dbca22d256,,,215-220
60868dfb3121ba8b56d205e7667db603a4bad356,Retinal vascular biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease,"The earliest detectable change in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the buildup of amyloid plaque in the brain. Early detection of AD, prior to irreversible neurological damage, is important for the efficacy of current interventions as well as for the development of new treatments. Although PiB-PET imaging and CSF amyloid are the gold standards for early AD diagnosis, there are practical limitations for population screening. AD-related pathology occurs primarily in the brain, but some of the hallmarks of the disease have also been shown to occur in other tissues, including the retina, which is more accessible for imaging. Retinal vascular changes and degeneration have previously been reported in AD using optical coherence tomography and laser Doppler techniques. This report presents results from analysis of retinal photographs from AD and healthy control participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing. This is the first study to investigate retinal blood vessel changes with respect to amyloid plaque burden in the brain. We demonstrate relationships between retinal vascular parameters, neocortical brain amyloid plaque burden and AD. A number of RVPs were found to be different in AD. Two of these RVPs, venular branching asymmetry factor and arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio, were also higher in healthy individuals with high plaque burden (P=0.01 and P=0.02 respectively, after false discovery rate adjustment). Retinal photographic analysis shows potential as an adjunct for early detection of AD or monitoring of AD-progression or response to treatments.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""S Frost"", ids = ""152209302""); list(name = ""Yogi Kanagasingam"", ids = ""34445092""); list(name = ""Hamid R.

f4e0feeb1ff47b6ee4b8a5acfe2c2bf0f91a6dea,Melt curve analysis for interpretation of MicroRNAs' gene expression data in foods,"This article illustrates the importance of melt curve analysis (MCA) in interpretation of mild nutrogenomic micro(mi)RNA expression data, by measuring the magnitude of the expression of key miRNA molecules in stool of healthy human adults as molecular markers, following the intake of Pomegranate juice (PGJ), functional fermented sobya (FS), rich in potential probiotic lactobacilli, or their combination. Total small RNA was isolated from stool of 25 volunteers before and following a three-week dietary intervention trial. Expression of 88 miRNA genes was evaluated using Qiagenâ€™s 96 well plate RT2 miRNA qPCR arrays. Employing parallel coordinates plots, there was no observed significant separation for the gene expression (Cq) values, using Roche 480Â® PCR LightCycler instrument used in this study, and none of the miRNAs showed significant statistical expression after controlling for the false discovery rate. On the other hand, melting temperature profiles produced during PCR amplification run, found seven significant genes (miR-184, miR-203, miR-373, miR-124, miR-96, miR-373 and miR-301a), which separated candidate miRNAs that could function as novel molecular markers of relevance to oxidative stress and immunoglobulin function, for the intake of polyphenol (PP)-rich, functional fermented foods rich in lactobacilli (FS), or their combination. We elaborate on these data and present a detailed review on use of melt curves for analyzing nutigenomic miRNA expression data, which initially appear to show no significant expressions, but are actually more subtle than this simplistic view, necessitating the understanding of the role of MCA for a comprehensive understanding of what the collective expression and MCA data collectively imply. *Correspondence to: Farid E Ahmed, GEM Tox Labs, Institute for Research in Biotechnology, 2905 South Memorial Dr, Greenville, NC 27834, USA, Tel. 252375-9656; E-mail: gemtoxconsultants@yahoo.com",2018,Chemistry,"list(name = ""Farid E.

8acc2cd3ef0c8b0de4581870f982b9b7bdba6a5d,PROGNOSTIC CLASSIfiER FOR ORAL POTENTIALLY MALIGNANT DISORDERS: AN INTEGRATED HISTOPATHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR APPROACH,"Objectives Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is associated with a high degree of morbidity and mortality. OS-CCs are often preceded by oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) which have a higher propensity to undergo malignant transformation (MT) compared to clinically normal oral mucosa. Currently there is no reliable method to determine which OPMD cases will undergo MT. This study was performed to construct a prognostic classifier for patients with OPMD by integrating clinical, histopathological and molecular factors and to discover a gene expression signature that characterises OPMD with a high risk of undergoing MT. Findings Statistical analysis of an OPMD patient cohort (23 MT vs. 25 with no MT) showed that site of initial OPMD (pâ€¯=â€¯0.043), binary oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) grading (pâ€¯=â€¯0.009) and loss of heterozygosity at 3p/9p/17p (pâ€¯=â€¯0.026) were statistically significant. Other demographic factors, clinical features and the WHO 3-tiered OED grading system were not statistically significant. Gene expression experiments revealed several genes that were differentially expressed between OPMD that underwent MT and those that did not [false discovery rate of Conclusions Our findings show that a classifier combining histopathological and molecular factors outperforms conventional methods for prognosticating clinical outcome in patients with OPMD. We have also shown that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue can be used to generate a molecular classification with clinical utility.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hans P Sathasivam"", ids = ""16135475""); list(name = ""Philip Sloan"", ids = ""49650324""); list(name = ""Ralf Kist"", ids = ""152118467""); list(name = ""Max Robinson"", ids = ""48132958"")",,,"Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, and Oral Radiology",128,
c49b593dbc88b4abc7ce1f5e5379ba5c803f8b36,Clinical Proteomics and Cytokine Profiling for Dengue Fever Disease Severity Biomarkers.,"Dengue fever (DF) is a major global health burden with a pathophysiology that is still incompletely understood. Biomarkers that predict and explain susceptibility to DF and its progression to its more severe hemorrhagic form are much needed. DF is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with a rapidly increasing incidence of disease severity. We conducted a clinical biomarker discovery study using both a case-control and longitudinal study design. Plasma proteome alterations in patients with DF (nâ€‰=â€‰12) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF, nâ€‰=â€‰24) were analyzed in comparison to healthy controls (HCs, nâ€‰=â€‰16), using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics methodology (false discovery rate of 1%, â‰¥2 peptides). Several proteins such as the alpha-2 macroglobulin, angiotensinogen, apolipoprotein B-100, serotransferrin, and ceruloplasmin were upregulated (fold change >1.2) in all DHF cases, and downregulated in DF (fold change <0.83), compared with HCs.

Previous research indicates increased prostate cancer risk for pesticide applicators and pesticide manufacturing workers. Although underlying mechanisms are unknown, evidence suggests a role of oxidative DNA damage.


OBJECTIVES
Because base excision repair (BER) is the predominant pathway involved in repairing oxidative damage, we evaluated interactions between 39 pesticides and 394 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 31 BER genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1,444 male controls in a nested case-control study of white Agricultural Health Study (AHS) pesticide applicators.


METHODS
We used likelihood ratio tests from logistic regression models to determine p-values for interactions between three-level pesticide exposure variables (none/low/high) and SNPs (assuming a dominant model), and the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparison adjustment approach.


RESULTS
The interaction between fonofos and rs1983132 in NEIL3 [nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (Escherichia coli)], which encodes a glycosylase that can initiate BER, was the most significant overall [interaction p-value (pinteract) = 9.3 Ã— 10-6; FDR-adjusted p-value = 0.01]. Fonofos exposure was associated with a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk among men with CT/TT genotypes for rs1983132 [odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for low and high use compared with no use were 1.65 (0.91, 3.01) and 3.25 (1.78, 5.92), respectively], whereas fonofos was not associated with prostate cancer risk among men with the CC genotype. Carbofuran and S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) interacted similarly with rs1983132; however, these interactions did not meet an FDR < 0.2.


CONCLUSIONS
Our significant finding regarding fonofos is consistent with previous AHS findings of increased prostate cancer risk with fonofos exposure among those with a family history of prostate cancer. Although requiring replication, our findings suggest a role of BER genetic variation in pesticide-associated prostate cancer risk.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kathryn Hughes Barry"", ids = ""6142406""); list(name = ""Stella Koutros"", ids = ""3662087""); list(name = ""Sonja I.

We tested candidate genes in pathways related to food intake and energy expenditure for association with measures of adiposity. Methods: We studied 355 genetic variants in 30 candidate genes in 7 molecular pathways related to obesity in two groups of adult subjects: 1,982 unrelated European Americans living in the New York metropolitan area drawn from the extremes of their body mass index (BMI) distribution and 593 related Yupâ€™ik Eskimos living in rural Alaska characterized for BMI, body composition, waist circumference, and skin fold thicknesses. Data were analyzed by using a mixed model in conjunction with a false discovery rate (FDR) procedure to correct for multiple testing. Results: After correcting for multiple testing, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Ghrelin (GHRL) (rs35682 and rs35683) were associated with BMI in the New York European Americans. This association was not replicated in the Yupâ€™ik participants. There was no evidence for gene Ã— gene interactions among genes within the same molecular pathway after adjusting for multiple testing via FDR control procedure.

Biofortification of crops has previously been suggested to alleviate widespread 25 human Ca and Mg deficiencies. In this study, new candidate genes influencing the leaf 26 accumulation of Ca and Mg were identified in young Brassica napus plants using associative 27 transcriptomics of ionomics datasets. A total of 247 and 166 SNP markers were associated with 28 leaf Ca and Mg concentration, respectively, after false discovery rate correction and removal 29 of SNPs with low second allele frequency. Gene expression markers at similar positions were 30 also associated with leaf Ca and Mg concentration, including loci on chromosomes A10 and 31 C2, within which lie previously identified transporter genes ACA8 and MGT7. Further 32 candidate genes were selected from seven loci and the mineral composition of whole 33 Arabidopsis thaliana shoots were characterised from lines mutated in orthologous genes. Four 34 and two mutant lines had reduced shoot Ca and Mg concentration, respectively, compared to 35 wild type plants. Three of these mutations were found to have tissue specific effects; notably 36 reduced silique Ca in all three such mutant lines. This knowledge could be applied in targeted 37 breeding, with the possibility of increasing Ca and Mg in plant tissue for improving human and 38 livestock nutrition. 39",2017,,"list(name = ""Thomas D Alcock"", ids = ""32903824""); list(name = ""Lenka HavlÃ­Ä\215kovÃ¡"", ids = ""46740983""); list(name = ""Zhesi He"", ids = ""3741426""); list(name = ""Ian Bancroft"", ids = ""5363342""); list(name = ""Philip John White"", ids = ""35299708""); list(name = ""Martin R Broadley"", ids = ""5471474""); list(name = ""Neil S Graham"", ids = ""2253486"")",,aa9de0a485d7d061db7b662d7c204d7e62790513; 3164b7f4984693c7933d6a5be07f15a2c70c69e6; c37bd55e89d87d022a9832990a4b69cc078d4053; fc85fb2ea86d8427a7df343b89543e5f1d7ca7c2; 5d30c286778e7ce34cb3459a17bb844cb3bbe414; 46ad2fcedb15e1b99246859e53967fc280e82602; 2f91a93f1da521bd68bde1e0d57f6c21806b47c5; 085c113158693f3182b9607e44b35318352c4f53; e18fbcea6cc861c407073ba0ce6ec725f9fb9947; 9f120809defbda3eac45e0abc64af8f52b0cc74d; 22561ebfe0ca124479d9b396a462384d1c2eb3b5; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5aa80a44def13b7e2768c77204746b600d2ca01c; 8393377a3133dfc785a117c31004c7cd6156292b; 30c7012c18f9c8b18278ef089f5e6c7cdbf75bac; 612d92842caa1c559eedf28a7228f95bf5f53bb8; 1f663b5ebfe3f5d57d43212e4b81729b437277d3; d11d7fb12249d964956ab8c1f43c6d1d2713ee0b; 3869ebebce8452284cc75b492df274eee8872401; e441e1454c3fac202b5ca249647674a7c87795ac; 83b2e0d77f3d7c4a2f296856fb09a68a1e097f13; 1f9a6a182c1755bbf4c0c7dc89033b8881f6ffc1,,,
5ee7132ec938749974171398576a3bcbee595885,A Gene-Based Analysis of Acoustic Startle Latency,"Latency of the acoustic startle response is the time required from the presentation of startling auditory stimulus until the startle response is elicited and provides an index of neural processing speed. Latency is prolonged in subjects with schizophrenia compared to controls in some but not all studies and is 68-90% heritable in baseline startle trials. In order to determine the genetic association with latency as a potential inroad into genetically based vulnerability to psychosis, we conducted a gene-based study of latency followed by an independent replication study of significant gene findings with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis of schizophrenia and control subjects. 313 subjects from an urban population of low socioeconomic status with mixed psychiatric diagnoses were included in the gene-based study. Startle testing was conducted using a Biopac M150 system according to our published methods. Genotyping was performed with the Omni-Quad 1M or the Omni Express BeadChip. The replication study was conducted on 154 schizophrenia subjects and 123 psychiatric controls. Genetic analyses were conducted with Illumina Human Omni1-Quad and OmniExpress BeadChips. Twenty-nine SNPs were selected from four genes that were significant in the gene-based analysis and also associated with startle and/or schizophrenia in the literature. Linear regressions on latency were conducted, controlling for age, race, and diagnosis as a dichotomous variable. In the gene-based study, 2,870 genes demonstrated the evidence of association after correction for multiple comparisons (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Pathway analysis of these genes revealed enrichment for relevant biological processes including neural transmission (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0029), synaptic transmission (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0032), and neuronal development (pâ€‰=â€‰0.024). The subsequent SNP-based replication analysis revealed a strong association of onset latency with the SNP rs901561 on the neuregulin gene (NRG1) in an additive model (betaâ€‰=â€‰0.21, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001), indicating that subjects with the AA and AG genotypes had slower mean latency than subjects with GG genotype. In conclusion, startle latency, a highly heritable measure that is slowed in schizophrenia, may be a useful biological probe for genetic contributions to psychotic disorders.

Methods Genome-wide association study (GWAS) included 1,950 individuals with PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC) study. Replication was conducted in the Parkinson's, Genes and Environment study, including 209 prevalent (PAGEP) and 517 incident (PAGEI) PD cases. Cox regression was used to test association with age at diagnosis. Individuals without neurologic disease were used to rule out confounding. Gene-level analysis and functional annotation were conducted using Functional Mapping and Annotation of GWAS platform (FUMA). Results The GWAS revealed 2 linked but seemingly independent association signals that mapped to LPPR1 on chromosome 9. LPPR1 was significant in gene-based analysis (p = 1E-8). The top signal (rs17763929, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.88, p = 5E-8) replicated in PAGEP (HR = 1.87, p = 0.01) but not in PAGEI. The second signal (rs73656147) was robust with no evidence of heterogeneity (HR = 1.95, p = 3E-6 in NGRC; HR = 2.14, p = 1E-3 in PAGEP + PAGEI, and HR = 2.00, p = 9E-9 in meta-analysis of NGRC + PAGEP + PAGEI). The associations were with age at diagnosis, not confounded by age in patients or in the general population. The PD-associated regions included variants with Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores = 10â€“19 (top 1%â€“10% most deleterious mutations in the genome), a missense with predicted destabilizing effect on LPPR1, an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for GRIN3A (false discovery rate [FDR] = 4E-4), and variants that overlap with enhancers in LPPR1 and interact with promoters of LPPR1 and 9 other brain-expressed genes (Hi-C FDR < 1E-6). Conclusions Through association with age at diagnosis, we uncovered LPPR1 as a modifier gene for PD. LPPR1 expression promotes neuronal regeneration after injury in animal models. Present data provide a strong foundation for mechanistic studies to test LPPR1 as a driver of response to damage and a therapeutic target for enhancing neuroregeneration and slowing disease progression.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zachary D.

4afecf31b4af11997e4001632d125714cb238dc3,RIP-chip enrichment analysis,"MOTIVATION
RIP-chip is a high-throughput method to identify mRNAs that are targeted by RNA-binding proteins. The protein of interest is immunoprecipitated, and the identity and relative amount of mRNA associated with it is measured on microarrays. Even if a variety of methods is available to analyse microarray data, e.g. to detect differentially regulated genes, the additional experimental steps in RIP-chip require specialized methods. Here, we focus on two aspects of RIP-chip data: First, the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation step performed in the RIP-chip protocol varies in between different experiments introducing bias not existing in standard microarray experiments. This requires an additional normalization step to compare different samples and even technical replicates. Second, in contrast to standard differential gene expression experiments, the distribution of measurements is not normal. We exploit this fact to define a set of biologically relevant genes in a statistically meaningful way.


RESULTS
Here, we propose two methods to analyse RIP-chip data: We model the measurement distribution as a gaussian mixture distribution, which allows us to compute false discovery rates (FDRs) for any cut-off. Thus, cut-offs can be chosen for any desired FDR. Furthermore, we use principal component analysis to determine the normalization factors necessary to remove immunoprecipitation bias. Both methods are evaluated on a large RIP-chip dataset measuring targets of Ago2, the major component of the microRNA guided RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Using published HITS-CLIP experiments performed with the same cell line as used for RIP-chip, we show that the mixture modelling approach is a necessary step to remove background, which computed FDRs are valid, and that the additional normalization is a necessary step to make experiments comparable.

d2481af331bc7a6d13561245c698ceb1b8469b9b,Estrogen and progesterone receptor status affect genome-wide DNA methylation profile in breast cancer.,"DNA methylation is the main epigenetic modification that occurs at the early stages of carcinogenesis. We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling to evaluate whether the DNA methylation state is different in the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of breast cancer. Twelve ER+/PR+ and 12 ER-/PR- breast cancer tissues were selected from the biorepository of the Seoul Breast Cancer Study for Infinium Methylation Assay. The difference of the DNA methylation state of 27 578 methylation sites in 14 000 genes between two groups was evaluated by Student's t-test. False discovery rate (FDR) was estimated to evaluate the probability of false positive associations. Of the 27 578 sites, 148 sites (0.54%) were significantly different between ER+/PR+ and ER-/PR- breast cancers (P < 0.001); 93 hypermethylated and 55 hypomethylated. Five genes, FAM124B (P = 7.26 Ã— 10(-7)), MANEAL (P = 3.38 Ã— 10(-7)), ST6GALNAC1 (P = 2.85 Ã— 10(-6)), NAV1 (P = 5.94 Ã— 10(-6)) and PER1 (P = 6.45 Ã— 10(-6)) remained significant after correction for multiple tests (FDR < 0.05). In a subsequent replication study for five genes, four of the five genes were validated; FAM124B and ST6GALNAC1 were significantly hypermethylated, and NAV1 and PER1 were significantly hypomethylated in ER+/PR+ breast cancers (P < 0.05). In the first genome-wide DNA methylation profiling according to the receptor status of breast cancer, we found that ER/PR status affects the DNA methylation state of FAM124B, ST6GALNAC1, NAV1 and PER1 in breast cancer.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Lian Sheng Li"", ids = ""50703795""); list(name = ""Kyoung-Mu Lee"", ids = ""5389020""); list(name = ""Wonshik Han"", ids = ""143702426""); list(name = ""Ji-Yeob Choi"", ids = ""1807509""); list(name = ""Ji-young Lee"", ids = ""48174528""); list(name = ""Gyeong Hoon Kang"", ids = ""5424708""); list(name = ""Sue Kyung Park"", ids = ""3395636""); list(name = ""Dong-Young Noh"", ids = ""1916796""); list(name = ""Keun-young Yoo"", ids = ""145888755""); list(name = ""Daehee Kang"", ids = ""144385624"")",f4f39208c2b644d09da5041893a5660dfda55509; 32505b8682d791c897cb67e450c0ddcefe49a215; e673bf8f7de8b26bfaf3bb9627153dba2cf28f89; 087da5544eae0387da66421e98bf70216d9e9e79; f597dc1962043729f3c9bc2ee2e5585afa808db8; 7bff537635c2458c5930f7c9308a651baa880755; cc235abd1bbb3ff536aaad97f37ecd4f05118a2e; 52d4059d9758a33e258912398428b20923d6a2f9; f10e75903a5eeb7dc3db97dcae9e5e96e6a4efd6; 367da278b9d702f8e5409683d7fbac26d9810698; 80becc573dce3d909864da5daacef6c728588f43; a0a00ec1f7251183399b6efee4740f34891a9e3c; a299cf5ebf1f528298b3996606ed3dff6d645f90; 3c62f540ef754bb6af0928750d7c5359eb492488; a1f2312f61cd6f577e7f198c7536fc0706dfcb61; 4a7f48639e759d90918698bdf32078fbfd4f294a; 98efa18f510441e1acae1b352da12f566af96751; 885ece3e379f1adb28bc8e0f0237083374e5e3db; c74be7cddf8b52c0d722e73b03b57a968afc3e23; 4d48e2704a15494c2fac296d421196d0537afdd9; 121f0ef2aa1bd327eb2e183d1da8c9d8ee8097f0; 76dce52e85559015254ec7e62b564c55fc40971c; 095b6177b8ad70861c1a9b9e366b3ea73e07a646; 603987239810c6880507735c150763bbc21cf031; e5426bd8b06be2b6ffb91f16a1903f3c6c3fb12d; 8f32778705091faf4bea3cbb2f00abf2dc7ab148; ae7a70280f87991a14e899cac4956567b101a5cd; ad61319f5df16d6f04fa0e5aba5e95240c9bd9b4; 47abd9d1c6f51cba7085b3303c2f2d4e237d3709; e629e041eb3cb65958ddd35ebd771cacc6c6241b; 2a46109b521761b5a5ce861b0aa5c5fcdc3c84c8; 0c01f91f1d75e034932c67c4218c70a04d67fef9; dfcd7ac2b097bd4f2df6b645081b4b6f7d8377bc; b70921f41806178c5bee28c51308d519ba0b9c69; b1998176d97b8eaff0d54c32bd2d82ac4453dcec; 1ed4b7931bf3ebcf70b151085eed917dfb1e5156; f37f5d7e2e568432a6aec6f3db1b70d2d9d96758; f4fc3c1065509884135830763bff9e31efec3c8e; 76693dc1b45b1e29740f210289b038e40508e717; cde06f52bd9dcad4fc9e86c325806b65b7c561dc; 2be619ecd8b157406bd3d48944e162a16bed2a9d; 109fa0fab30d9fba754d2cb3823c00d87be33d00; 71930712c592097e983e8b94fd98b9afe46a591c; 4952510c2345e301e48901c0d14b8aa34c0a7e01; ce2c2f22d728122969e2578ddf4861cf6a972c68,1f2cf96cd85fac5e0d0fce2ed35eb944b8831e8c; 291b82ab53b496fa2a4d17c10f3bd11be12ad3fa; f5c5d87931117422caa06a237fe0124bf00971c5; c9d7ee960cd44cb40dcac6f5d5e3bf3615453570; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; cac8ef52401186b739f6f94ded039e8d54151e0f; e78fa2b5fe9c7929bad93d3f0b8311c602242f75; 0ca4d6189311f663766e5412577f4ff278f43346; 6e00c044af17f1286e490e79ccfdcc0c8b9c38c5; 3160f5fadad58d2ab8851cda0c399b65eb6ed24e; 2e766d2e8b86f11d25e501515789bce35fb7fac6; 8711a708ce1c4ba3bfb96821e2264117f9fe4d89; e024ef94fc1eabe328e4a224f4356da42ee92424; c9febf54c92070c9beecd6ddcc50263657001fd7; 7b9fc19db271a9f711e208a7f77c4d7077a2eea6; 7d996ae76798cc9e39dfb7d024f4b08e4b17b3f5,Human molecular genetics,19 21,"

53a49135f54ff069b975e371621d204839f0e2ff,"Parkinson Disease: Diffusion MR Imaging to Detect Nigrostriatal Pathway Loss in a Marmoset Model Treated with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.","PURPOSE
To investigate the use of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) to detect denervation of the nigrostriatal pathway in a nonhuman primate model of Parkinson disease (PD) after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the institutional committee for animal experiments. DTI was performed in marmosets (n = 6) by using a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) imager before and 10 weeks after administration of MPTP. Fixed brains of a normal marmoset and a marmoset model of PD (n = 1) were analyzed by using microscopic tractography. Tyrosine-hydroxylase staining of dopaminergic neurons and three-dimensional histologic analysis also were performed in normal marmosets (n = 2) and a PD marmoset model (n = 2) to validate the course of the nigrostriatal pathway revealed at tractography. Statistical analysis of voxel-based and post hoc region-of-interest analyses of DTI maps was performed by using a paired t test.


RESULTS
At voxel-based analysis of DTI before and after treatment, MPTP-treated marmoset brains showed significantly increased axial and radial diffusivity in the bilateral nigrostriatal pathway (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). The largest area of significantly increased diffusivity was an area of axial diffusivity in the right hemispere (177 mm(3)) that corresponded to the location of dopaminergic neurodegeneration at histologic evaluation. Region-of-interest analysis revealed a 27% increase in axial diffusivity in the right hemisphere (1.198 mm(2)/sec Â± 0.111 to 1.522 mm(2)/sec Â± 0.118; P = .002). Three-dimensional histologic analysis with tyrosine-hydroxylase staining showed the course of the nigrostriatal pathway and degeneration in the PD marmoset model as the absence of a tyrosine-hydroxylase stained region. Microscopic tractography showed that the connection of the substantia nigra to the striatum followed the same course as the nigrostriatal pathway and fewer fiber tracts in the PD marmoset model.


CONCLUSION
DTI and microscopic tractography showed the loss of fiber structures of the nigrostriatal pathway in the marmoset model of PD. The results of this study provide a potential basis for the use of DTI in the clinical diagnosis of PD.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Keigo Hikishima"", ids = ""2927524""); list(name = ""Kiyoshi Ando"", ids = ""145560850""); list(name = ""Ryutaro Yano"", ids = ""49805793""); list(name = ""Kenji Kawai"", ids = ""145765041""); list(name = ""Yuji Komaki"", ids = ""2300049""); list(name = ""T Inoue"", ids = ""49756589""); list(name = ""Toshio Itoh"", ids = ""47763241""); list(name = ""Masayuki Yamada"", ids = ""143863985""); list(name = ""Suketaka Momoshima"", ids = ""3057431""); list(name = ""Hirotaka James Okano"", ids = ""8354275""); list(name = ""Hideyuki Okano"", ids = ""2238040"")",9d4905dd013cfd88c620c9e4607179e42aa4847e; 0882e80e49e5fa9069ae72e827c45f44c797d3a2; 3cccdde267df71647b6f4f2958ac672da09a5e71; 69286f5f1cc6011359ddfa492251b106b7f13a37; fd647d313706a515cdf96f9a5c302d3f2dafe29c; 2dc4d97334b065d7a4beff5728c54993a5172a3c; e8e9a75ccb1f4290d4f6c0462bbfbb9a6cac4c68; cbb60cf344e4d42e510c678563123d99c5fe6d3a; 5db2e80c059e68d28acf3d0ca36d8e5e0480aff3; aab928c35bc5b5b89aa203f6c9072aab9bab22a3; 4a51c1d850ae9d88688e20c03511a6613cb1f315; 450ad3f3f14ec5aa38e5f9bdf0c4025a117f8a91; ebbe06132f95712f24c69d6cafdcb8f4ba9eea72; 38d7f6d3a6737cbf6f967b5d76aae1b26e10f928; 5da4ba2605e2a94ad0716ef181595e80fb935fb5; ca8a12175242d71eb6844705d0351aeee675e519; 79d8cfbc2215aa2882ba680bacf1b6c48d0a0dd0; e36bf8bcd19a7d12c035156fbe3c4cbd997f4729; fb0eb6a58d9b8875aa57282b2d48e35f565b1943; 30dcd1f2a22b0033889c1bc1ef68dcf1c03b68e6; 39b462d88bc553c22a9405039fe9377cee607838,,Radiology,275 2,"

20f97e37aa4909feab96747146988ef6de048289,Inference about causation between body mass index and DNA methylation in blood from a twin family study,"BackgroundSeveral studies have reported DNA methylation in blood to be associated with body mass index (BMI), but few have investigated causal aspects of the association. We used a twin family design to assess this association at two life points and applied a novel analytical approach to appraise the evidence for causality.MethodsThe methylation profile of DNA from peripheral blood was measured for 479 Australian women from 130 twin families. Linear regression was used to estimate the associations of DNA methylation at ~410,000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs), and of the average DNA methylation at ~20,000 genes, with current BMI, BMI at age 18â€“21 years, and the change between the two (BMI change). A novel regression-based methodology for twins, Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding (ICE FALCON), was used to assess causation.ResultsAt a 5% false discovery rate, nine, six and 12 CpGs at 24 loci were associated with current BMI, BMI at age 18â€“21 years and BMI change, respectively. The average DNA methylation of theÂ BHLHE40 and SOCS3 loci was associated with current BMI, and of theÂ PHGDH locus with BMI change. From the ICE FALCON analyses with BMI as the predictor and DNA methylation as the outcome, a womanâ€™s DNA methylation level was associated with her co-twinâ€™s BMI, and the association disappeared afterÂ conditioning on her own BMI, consistent with BMI causing DNA methylation. To the contrary, using DNA methylation as the predictor and BMI as the outcome, a womanâ€™s BMI was not associated with her co-twinâ€™s DNA methylation level, consistent with DNA methylation not causing BMI.ConclusionFor middle-aged women, peripheral blood DNA methylation at several genomic locations is associated with current BMI, BMI at age 18â€“21 years and BMI change.

To attenuate this effect, specific SNPs are often pre-selected for genotyping. In general, there are two ways to reduce the dimensionality of data and facilitate selection. The first is to focus on the biological property inherent to each SNP (Zhao et Human Mutation and select those that are likely to bear functionality relevant to the disease of interest. The second approach focuses on the underlying data structure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs and selects by factor analysis a representative subset of SNPs et American Journal of Human Genetics The first method ignores the data structure between SNPs, whereas the second method neglects the biological significance of the SNPs in question. The information considered and neglected by these two methods makes them complimentary. Therefore, in an attempt to enhance the selection of we propose a method combining the information obtained from each of these methods in a weighted factor analysis model.

d5d97f9deda96fecd111f51faec03e9ac517354b,A large-scale genome simulation model incorporating patterns of linkage disequilibrium,"Evaluation of multiple hypotheses is a common problem, especially in genome wide association studies. False Discovery Rate control is often used to correct for multiple comparisons. However, this approach is influenced by linkage disequilibrium and needs to be evaluated. For such evaluation, first a model needs to be developed with a simulated linkage disequilibrium pattern that matches as closely as possible the observed linkage disequilibrium structure. This paper outlines the steps involved in the development of such a model, using mouse genome data as an example.

ba65dcfe99a1d7cf65eb107f4dd6097dc728b8e9,Estimating false discovery rates for contingency tables,"When testing a large number of hypotheses, it can be helpful to estimate or control the false discovery rate (FDR), the expected proportion of tests called significant that are truly null. The FDR is intricately linked to probability that a truly null test is significant, and thus a number of methods have been described that estimate or control the FDR by directly using the p-values of the hypothesis tests. Most of these methods make the assumption that the p-values are uniformly and continuously distributed under the null hypothesis, an assumption that often does not hold for finite data. In this paper, we consider the estimation of FDR for contingency tables. We show how Fisherâ€™s exact test can be extended to efficiently calculate the exact null distribution over a set of contingency tables. Using this exact null distribution, we explore the estimation of each of the terms in the FDR estimation, characterize the asymptotic convergence of the estimator, and show how the conservative bias can be reduced by removing certain tests from consideration. The resulting estimator has substantially less conservative bias than traditional approaches.",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jonathan M.

Inflammatory status, diagnosis and medication use were controlled for. Results: In total 628 samples from 373 individuals were included in the analysis (HC=44, CD=41, UC= 42, FAP=1, UCIPAA=213 and FAPIPAA=32). 108 genera were detected which met the inclusion criteria. No differences between the pouch and the afferent limb were detected yet several organisms were differentially abundant between sigmoid and TI samples. Numerous genuslevel alterations were observed between pouches and both sigmoid and TI samples (pFDR,.05). Shifts in the microbiota between patients with and without pouches included an increase in several members of Proteobacteria in pouches and Clostridia and Bacteroidetes in colonic tissue. Frequencies of several genera in the pouch were similar to those in the TI, while others resembled those in the sigmoid. Furthermore, organisms which were previously implicated in pouchitis or non-surgical IBD were detected at differential levels between pouch and non-surgical samples. Conclusion: Despite the phenotypic similarities between pouch complications and non-surgical IBD, differences in the microbial composition of samples from these groups are apparent and likely correspond to adaptive changes in the ileal pouch following surgery. Such differences could have important implications for better understanding pathogenesis and for clinical management.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""Maomeng Tong"", ids = ""3800723""); list(name = ""Ian H McHardy"", ids = ""49371389""); list(name = ""Paul M.

Thirteen clinically healthy male goats, born to SRLV-infected does and castrated at the age of 4 months, were followed up for 2 years. They were serologically tested weekly and on this basis assigned to seropositive (nâ€‰=â€‰7) and seronegative (nâ€‰=â€‰6) group. At the age of 6, 12, 18 and 24 months their serum was subjected to metabolomic analysis using a commercial AbsoluteIDQÂ® p180 Kit assay designed to measure concentrations of 188 metabolites. Finally, 134 metabolites had concentrations above the limit of detection and were included in the analysis. Twenty three metabolites differed between seropositive and seronegative goats at a false discovery rate of 25% and with fold change of at least 1.5: 21 metabolites at the age of 6 months and 2 metabolites at the age of 24 months.

Functional modules within protein sequences are often extracted by consensus sequence patterns representing a linear motif; however, other functional regions may only be described by combined features such as amino acid composition, profiles of amino acid properties and randomly distributed short sequence motifs. If only a small number of functional examples are well characterized, the researcher needs a tool to extract similar sequences for further investigation.

We develop Risk-stratify - a two phase algorithm that is designed to achieve confident risk-stratification. In the first phase, we grow a tree to partition the covariate space. Each node in the tree is split using statistical tests that determine if the risks of the child nodes are different or not. The choice of the statistical tests depends on whether the data is censored (Log-rank test) or not (U-test). The set of the leaves of the tree form a partition. The risk distribution of patients that belong to a leaf is different from the sibling leaf but not the rest of the leaves. Therefore, some of the leaves that have similar underlying risks are incorrectly specified to have different risks. In the second phase, we develop a novel recursive graph decomposition approach to address this problem. We merge the leaves of the tree that have similar risks to form new leaves that form the final output. We apply Risk-stratify on a cohort of patients (with no history of cardiovascular disease) from UK Biobank and assess their risk for cardiovascular disease. Risk-stratify significantly improves risk-stratification, i.e., a lower fraction of the groups have over/under estimated risks (measured in terms of false discovery rate; 33% reduction) in comparison to state-of-the-art methods for cardiovascular prediction (Random forests, Cox model, etc.). We find that the Cox model significantly over estimates the risk of 21,621 patients out of 216,211 patients. Risk-stratify can accurately categorize 2,987 of these 21,621 patients as low-risk individuals.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kartik Ahuja"", ids = ""3048927""); list(name = ""Mihaela van der Schaar"", ids = ""1729969"")",,c7dd480985abc2b054660dff2fd95a2f0ad65d8e; 5227e39d3e05abed01d8648f83da13d86e079ac0; 725cd02f9ab4e5e4f7db6ef0d2ff5b13819a6fc1; aa16ececbc01393c2bab7d053c235be091436847; 3e708b0cd19818e0c7408765dd922835661f8a24; 1a6f1908f454ed053a477b31f269e98071f97372; 776f6d45b38cf048ff30cea41f0cd3ceeefed622; 2cecc34e76fb8fa07231b191ffb8f1d82f8eed78; a777c0d74cd7e49e44e005500bc6e05d24e39548; c34467299f20cd47a0f155d357439967030de972; bdc3d618db015b2f17cd76224a942bfdfc36dc73; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 20a70d2fbaad533508875dbab19d09e3f67f748e; fd0a23aef8bb1706d0835a836960d7cf0d21eadd; a02d6787c595595e9bf729c16b6fa196479b22ee; e8301dff0bfc1193bc3a290525c150a493b4cb43; 5b133ed784d0971d9ccd2899c2fb113af977b0d6; 60f788264e6278374be9dabd8e2a644cc65129b6; 7b261c11533a4bdcb14f10d840660bd60fc5130a; 25884a643bc059f7411406655d56456e4eac43fa; 523d8aa0aae3239b82a499562c0696118edf67d3; 30157f579e9d676dc70337ae06dd6706cc55c757; edbd712bcf5e113c13b1ed9fa55d0f7479342cd4; d8a3c97179b2bd83de64149c273a5655ef1a2661; ae2118598c88a81d0bafcdc2d9706ff17944c307; d3f979ca6d597799e7dbc141440eb43d5d380ca1; a3b8146c7950597628689d14551e74d46cc3543d; b83578059c00952c1c75a008b6d1c5ff1b834dd9; b8d5c58db6c85e73d4bf334ac9f3a8cc33bdfe92; 950bb724db08b009e6305157ac21b484cd2771fe; 9ee2d6a8de063e2621eebc620b9d9d3d8a380374,ArXiv,abs/1811.00753,
27bed502b0bdbb9d3999fde5144dff82e42e91ef,Genome-wide DNA methylation differences between late-onset Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls in human frontal cortex.,"Evidence supports a role for epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but little has been done on a genome-wide scale to identify potential sites involved in disease. This study investigates human postmortem frontal cortex genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between 12 LOAD and 12 cognitively normal age- and gender-matched subjects. Quantitative DNA methylation is determined at 27,578 CpG sites spanning 14,475 genes via the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray. Data are analyzed using parallel linear models adjusting for age and gender with empirical Bayes standard error methods. Gene-specific technical and functional validation is performed on an additional 13 matched pair samples, encompassing a wider age range. Analysis reveals 948 CpG sites representing 918 unique genes as potentially associated with LOAD disease status pending confirmation in additional study populations. Across these 948 sites the subtle mean methylation difference between cases and controls is 2.9%. The CpG site with a minimum false discovery rate located in the promoter of the gene Transmembrane Protein 59 (TMEM59) is 7.3% hypomethylated in cases. Methylation at this site is functionally associated with tissue RNA and protein levels of the TMEM59 gene product. The TMEM59 gene identified from our discovery approach was recently implicated in amyloid-Î² protein precursor post-translational processing, supporting a role for epigenetic change in LOAD pathology. This study demonstrates widespread, modest discordant DNA methylation in LOAD-diseased tissue independent from DNA methylation changes with age. Identification of epigenetic biomarkers of LOAD risk may allow for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Kelly M Bakulski"", ids = ""4158748""); list(name = ""Dana C Dolinoy"", ids = ""4510429""); list(name = ""Maureen A.

c1f9ab2732475d27651dd96373a7024eb2d30737,Wild Animal Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network,"Wildlife monitoring and analysis are an active research field since last many decades. In this paper, we focus on wildlife monitoring and analysis through animal detection from natural scenes acquired by camera-trap networks. The image sequences obtained from camera-trap consist of highly cluttered images that hinder the detection of animal resulting in low-detection rates and high false discovery rates. To handle this problem, we have used a camera-trap database that has candidate animal proposals using multilevel graph cut in the spatiotemporal domain. These proposals are used to create a verification phase that identifies whether a given patch is animal or background. We have designed animal detection model using self-learned Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) features. This efficient feature set is then used for classification using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and ensemble tree. Our intensive results show that our detection model using DCNN features provides accuracy of 91.4% on standard camera-trap dataset.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Gyanendra K.

While several studies have investigated the effects of exercise training in human skeletal muscle and the chronic effect of Î²2 -agonist treatment in rodent muscle, their effects on muscle proteome signature with related functional measures in humans are still incompletely understood. Herein we show that daily Î²2 -agonist treatment attenuates training-induced enhancements in exercise performance and maximal oxygen consumption, and alters muscle proteome signature and phenotype in trained young men. Daily Î²2 -agonist treatment abolished several of the training-induced enhancements in muscle oxidative capacity and caused a repression of muscle metabolic pathways; furthermore, Î²2 -agonist treatment induced a slow-to-fast twitch muscle phenotype transition. The present study indicates that chronic Î²2 -agonist treatment confounds the positive effect of high intensity training on exercise performance and oxidative capacity, which is of interest for the large proportion of persons using inhaled Î²2 -agonists on a daily basis, including athletes.


ABSTRACT
Although the effects of training have been studied for decades, data on muscle proteome signature remodelling induced by high intensity training in relation to functional changes in humans remains incomplete. Likewise, Î²2 -agonists are frequently used to counteract exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but the effects Î²2 -agonist treatment on muscle remodelling and adaptations to training are unknown. In a placebo-controlled parallel study, we randomly assigned 21 trained men to 4Â weeks of high intensity training with (HIT+Î²2 A) or without (HIT) daily inhalation of Î²2 -agonist (terbutaline, 4Â mgÂ dose-1 ). Of 486 proteins identified by mass-spectrometry proteomics of muscle biopsies sampled before and after the intervention, 32 and 85 were changing (false discovery rate (FDR)Â â‰¤5%) with the intervention in HIT and HIT+Î²2 A, respectively. Proteome signature changes were different in HIT and HIT+Î²2 A (PÂ =Â 0.005), wherein Î²2 -agonist caused a repression of 25 proteins in HIT+Î²2 A compared to HIT, and an upregulation of 7 proteins compared to HIT. Î²2 -Agonist repressed or even downregulated training-induced enrichment of pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycogen metabolism, but upregulated pathways related to histone trimethylation and the nucleosome. Muscle contractile phenotype changed differently in HIT and HIT+Î²2 A (PÂ â‰¤Â 0.001), with a fast-to-slow twitch transition in HIT and a slow-to-fast twitch transition in HIT+Î²2 A. Î²2 -Agonist attenuated training-induced enhancements in maximal oxygen consumption (PÂ â‰¤Â 0.01) and exercise performance (6.1 vs. 11.6%, PÂ â‰¤Â 0.05) in HIT+Î²2 A compared to HIT. These findings indicate that daily Î²2 -agonist treatment attenuates the beneficial effects of high intensity training on exercise performance and oxidative capacity, and causes remodelling of muscle proteome signature towards a fast-twitch phenotype.",2018,Biology;

2168a35a55602b513f4375a7b452222d3c883864,Exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Accelerated DNA Methylation Aging,"BACKGROUND
Aging is related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and is affected by environmental factors. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is associated with adverse health outcomes; but the association of such exposure with DNA methylation aging, a novel aging marker, is unclear.


OBJECTIVES
Our aim was to investigate the association of PAH exposure with methylation aging.


METHODS
We trained and validated a methylation age predictor suitable for Chinese populations using whole blood methylation data in 989 Chinese and 160 Caucasians. We defined two aging indicators: Î´age, as methylation age minus chronological age; and aging rate, the ratio of methylation to chronological age. The association of PAH exposure with aging indicators was evaluated using linear regressions in three panels of healthy Chinese participants (N=539, among the aforementioned 989 Chinese participants) whose exposure levels were assessed by 10 urinary monohydroxy-PAH metabolites.


RESULTS
We developed a methylation age predictor providing accurate predictions in both Chinese individuals and Caucasian persons (R=0.94-0.96, RMSE=3.8-4.3). Among the 10 urinary metabolites that we measured, 1-hydroxypyrene and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene were associated with methylation aging independently of other OH-PAHs and risk factors; 1-unit increase in 1-hydroxypyrene was associated with a 0.53-y increase in Î”age [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.88; false discovery rate (FDR) FDR=0.004] and 1.17% increase in aging rate (95% CI: 0.36, 1.98; FDR=0.02), whereas for 9-hydroxyphenanthrene, the increase was 0.54-y for Î”age (95% CI: 0.17, 0.91; FDR=0.004), and 1.15% for aging rate (95% CI: 0.31, 1.99; FDR=0.02). The association direction was consistent across the three Chinese panels with the association magnitude correlating with the panels' exposure levels; the association was validated by methylation data of purified leukocytes. Several cytosine-phosphoguanines, including those located on FHL2 and ELOVL2, were found associated with both aging indicators and monohydroxy-PAH levels.


CONCLUSIONS
We developed a methylation age predictor specific for Chinese populations but also accurate for Caucasian populations. Our findings suggest that exposure to PAHs may be associated with an adverse impact on human aging and epigenetic alterations in Chinese populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2773.",2018,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jun Li"", ids = ""49297948""); list(name = ""Xiaoyan Zhu"", ids = ""145213538""); list(name = ""Kuai Yu"", ids = ""2637260""); list(name = ""Haijing Jiang"", ids = ""2870112""); list(name = ""Yizhi Zhang"", ids = ""1591122366""); list(name = ""Biqi Wang"", ids = ""4255612""); list(name = ""Xuezhen Liu"", ids = ""46523127""); list(name = ""Siyun Deng"", ids = ""4416184""); list(name = ""Jie Hu"", ids = ""1748341""); list(name = ""Qifei Deng"", ids = ""4056042""); list(name = ""Huizhen Sun"", ids = ""48729066""); list(name = ""Huan Guo"", ids = ""1729940""); list(name = ""Xiaomin Appleton Zhang"", ids = ""145326228""); list(name = ""Weihong Chen"", ids = ""2467426""); list(name = ""Jing Yuan"", ids = ""145078778""); list(name = ""Meian He"", ids = ""8362646""); list(name = ""Yansen Bai"", ids = ""4343862""); list(name = ""Xu Han"", ids = ""145760440""); list(name = ""Bing Liu"", ids = ""34171868""); list(name = ""Chuanyao Liu"", ids = ""4234662""); list(name = ""Yanjun Guo"", ids = ""40042790""); list(name = ""Bing Zhang"", ids = ""48335595""); list(name = ""Zhihong Zhang"", ids = ""48806103""); list(name = ""Frank B Hu"", ids = ""1891795""); list(name = ""Wenjing Gao"", ids = ""35636851""); list(name = ""Li-ming Li"", ids = ""49193151""); list(name = ""Mark G.

fc9619aa93e161cda0a67faf48e88d325e2b4f3c,Rumen epithelial adaptation to high-grain diets involves the coordinated regulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis.,"The molecular mechanisms underlying rumen epithelial adaption to high-grain (HG) diets are unknown. To gain insight into the metabolic mechanisms governing epithelial adaptation, mature nonlactating dairy cattle (n = 4) were transitioned from a high-forage diet (HF, 0% grain) to an HG diet (65% grain). After the cattle were fed the HG diet for 3 wk, they returned to the original HF diet, which they were fed for an additional 3 wk. Continuous ruminal pH, ruminal short chain fatty acids, and plasma Î²-hydroxybutyrate were measured on a weekly basis, and rumen papillae were biopsied from the ventral sac to assess alterations in mRNA expression profiles. The subacute form of ruminal acidosis was diagnosed during the first week of the HG period (4.6 Â± 1.6 h/day <pH 5.6), but not during weeks 2 and 3, thereby indicating ruminal adaption to the HG diet. Changes in the mRNA expression profile of rumen papillae were initially examined using Bovine Affymetrix microarrays; a total of 521 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate P < 0.08) were uncovered from the first to third week of the HG period. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of microarray results revealed that enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis were coordinately downregulated from the first to third week of the HG period. In addition, the LXR/RXR activation pathway was significant and included several genes involved in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. The differential expression signature of eight genes representing the key regulatory points of cholesterol homeostasis was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Based upon our pathway and network results we propose a model to explain cellular events during rumen epithelial adaptation to HG diets and thus provide molecular targets that may be useful in the treatment and prevention of ruminal acidosis.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael A Steele"", ids = ""40323214""); list(name = ""Gordon Vandervoort"", ids = ""10193896""); list(name = ""O.

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common T cell-mediated disorder with limited therapeutics. A molecular profile of cytokine pathways in AA tissues is lacking. Although studies have focused on TH1/IFN-Î³ responses, several observations support a shared genetic background between AA and atopy.


OBJECTIVE
We sought to define the AA scalp transcriptome and associated biomarkers with comparisons with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis.


METHODS
We performed microarray and RT-PCR profiling of 27 lesional and 17 nonlesional scalp samples from patients with AA for comparison with normal scalp samples (n = 6). AA gene expression was also compared with samples from patients with lesional or nonlesional AD and those with psoriasis. A fold change of greater than 1.5 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 were used for differentially expressed genes (DEGs).


RESULTS
We established the AA transcriptomes (lesional vs nonlesional: 734 DEGs [297 upregulated and 437 downregulated]; lesional vs normal: 4230 DEGs [1980 upregulated and 2250 downregulated]), including many upregulated immune and downregulated hair keratin genes. Equally impressive as upregulation in TH1/interferon markers (IFNG and CXCL10/CXCL9) were those noted in TH2 (IL13, CCL18, CCL26, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and periostin), TH9/IL-9, IL-23 (p40 and p19), and IL-16 mediators (all P < .05). There were no increases in TH17/TH22 markers. Hair keratin (KRT) expressions (ie, KRT86 and KRT85) were significantly suppressed in lesional skin. Greater scalp involvement (>25%) was associated with greater immune and keratin dysregulation and larger abnormalities in nonlesional scalp samples (ie, CXCL10 and KRT85).


CONCLUSIONS
Our data associate the AA signature with TH2, TH1, IL-23, and IL-9/TH9 cytokine activation, suggesting consideration of anti-TH2, anti-TH1, and anti-IL-23 targeting strategies. Similar to psoriasis and AD, clinical trials with selective antagonists are required to dissect key pathogenic pathways.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mayte SuÃ¡rez-FariÃ±as"", ids = ""14842374""); list(name = ""Benjamin Ungar"", ids = ""48462903""); list(name = ""Shinji Noda"", ids = ""32577649""); list(name = ""Anjali Shroff"", ids = ""143897872""); list(name = ""Yasaman Mansouri"", ids = ""5550084""); list(name = ""Judilyn Fuentes-Duculan"", ids = ""1398155197""); list(name = ""Annette Czernik"", ids = ""11036402""); list(name = ""X Zheng"", ids = ""90460818""); list(name = ""Yeriel D.

ff9ae7ecc8b8a4f6f2d1a63bdfecbef89abfb673,"Multiple Testing Issues in Discriminating Compound-Related Peaks and Chromatograms from High Frequency Noise, Spikes and Solvent-Based Noise in LC - MS Data Sets","Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) is a powerful method for sensitive detection and quantification of proteins and peptides in complex biological fluids like serum. LC-MS produces complex data sets, consisting of some hundreds of millions of data points per sample at a resolution of 0.1 amu in the m/z domain and 7000 data points in the time domain. However, the detection of the lower abundance proteins from this data is hampered by the presence of artefacts, such as high frequency noise and spikes. Moreover, not all of the tens of thousands of the chromatograms produced per sample are relevant for the pursuit of the biomarkers. Thus in analysing the LC-MS data, two critical pre-processing issues arise. Which of the thousands of the: 1. chromatograms per sample are relevant for the detection of the biomarkers?, and 2. signals per chromatogram are truly compound-related? Each of these issues involves assessing the significance (deviation from noise) of multiple observations and the issue of multiple comparisons arises. Current methods disregard the multiplicity and provide no concrete threshold for significance. However, with such procedures, the probability of one or more false-positives is high as the number of tests to be performed is large, and must be controlled. Realizing that the cut-offs for declaring a chromatogram (or a signal) to be compound-related can hugely influence which proteins are detected, it seems natural to define thresholds that are neither arbitrary nor subjective. We suggest the choice of thresholds guided by the critical aim of controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in multiple hypotheses testing for significance over a large set of features produced per sample. This involves the use of the regression diagnostics to characterize the signals of a chromatogram (e.g. as outliers or influential) and to suggest suitable tests statistics for the multiple testing procedures (MTP) for discriminating noise and spikes from true signals. The role of the Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in this MTP is investigated. The method is applied to LC-MS datasets from trypsin-digested serum spiked with varying levels of horse heart cytochrome C (cytoc).",2007,Mathematics; Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""S. O.

5bb5a0e71955043a5d5a30b951ba299288f4851c,Altered Immune-Related Gene Expressions Indicate Oral Cancer Nodal Disease,"Lymph nodal disease (LN+) is the most significant prognostic factor of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Current risk indicator(s) for guiding elective neck dissection (END) is insufficient for clinically node-negative (cN0) patients, resulting in under- or overtreatment. While the role of immunological events in tumorigenesis and metastasis is evident, the prognostic implication in OSCC remains unclear. The study objective was to investigate large-scale immune-related gene expression and determine its prognostic value on node-free survival (NFS). We analyzed patients who received intent-to-cure surgery with at least 3 y of follow-up and known outcome of LN through a pan-Canadian surgical trial. Total RNA was extracted from surgical tissues with >70% tumor content and analyzed on a 730-gene panel (NanoString nCounterÂ® PanCancer Immune Panel). We first profiled gene expression in a fresh-frozen (FF) discovery set to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes, which were then used in unsupervised clustering analysis to identify patient subgroups. The prognostic value of the identified DE genes was then validated on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. A total of 177 RNA samples were derived from 89 FF and 88 FFPE surgical tissues, of which 45 (51%) and 40 (45%), respectively, were from patients who developed LN+. We identified 6 DE genes overexpressed in LN+ tumors (false discovery rate <0.001; log2 fold change >1). Clustering analysis separated the patients into 2 subgroups (CM1, CM2), with CM2 exhibiting significantly increased expression and worse 5-y NFS rate (28%; P < 0.001). The prognostic value of these 6 candidate genes was validated on FFPE samples, which were also separated into 2 distinct prognostic groups, confirming the association between increased gene expression and poor 5-y NFS (CM1, 70.3%; CM2, 43.3%; P = 0.01). This is the first study identifying a panel of immune-related genes associated with NFS that can potentially be used clinically stratifying the risk of LN+ at the time of OSCC diagnosis.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kelly Y P Liu"", ids = ""46578309""); list(name = ""X J David Lu"", ids = ""144668841""); list(name = ""Y.

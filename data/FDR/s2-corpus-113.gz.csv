3728163e89f7752c5972e68e4a48722b8e2d4af5,Abstract T MP50: Novel TIA Serum Biomarkers Identified by Mass-Spectroscopy Proteomics,"Background: One of the â€œholy grailsâ€ in vascular neurology is a TIA serum marker. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a unique, unbiased method to identify candidate proteins, was used to test the serum of patients with transient neurologic symptoms for biomarkers of cerebral ischemia.

Methods: Patients with transient neurologic symptoms were prospectively enrolled. Mass spectrometry was performed on the serum samples, and results were searched against the Human Uniport database. Three candidate proteins were found, and serum concentrations of these proteins were measured by ELISA in a second cohort of prospectively enrolled patients. The studentâ€™s t-test was used for comparison. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure for multiple comparison adjustments determined significance for the proteomic screen.

Results: Patients with TIA (n=20), minor stroke (n=15), and controls (i.e. migraine, seizure, n=12) were enrolled in the first cohort. Ceruloplasmin, complement component C8 gamma (C8Î³) and platelet basic protein (PBP) were significantly different between the ischemic samples (TIA and minor stroke) and the controls (p = 0.0001, p=0.00027, p=0.00105 respectively). A second cohort of patients with TIA (n=16), minor stroke (n=20), and controlsâ€™ (n=12) serum was tested. PBP serum concentrations were increased in the ischemic samples compared to control (for TIA and stroke, p= 0.04, for TIA alone, p=0.027). Ceruloplasmin trended towards increased concentrations in the ischemic groups (p=0.10), and an insignificant increase in C8Î³ (p=0.23) was found.

Conclusions: PBP has been identified as potential serum biomarker for TIA. Larger sample size may find that ceruloplasmin is an additional candidate. Ultimately, a panel of proteins may be required. Larger studies are needed to determine the validity of these proteins in clinical use.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul M.

One hundred myoclonic jerks were averaged in time series and in spectral domain. For the latter, we chose 100 (10-second) segments from interictal background and used the unpaired t-test for the jerk-related and control spectral data to obtain the t value and corresponding p value at each pixel. We corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate procedure. We generated maps of spectral significance per electrode. All insignificant t-values were converted to 0 for easier visual analysis. Standard back-averaging of 100 jerks disclosed a single spike preceding EMG activity by 19-27 milliseconds. No other definite ictal patterns were discernible in the time domain. Statistical analysis of the same 100 epochs in the time-frequency domain disclosed a greater temporal extent of the seizure, as well as a more detailed rendering of rhythms and frequencies involved. Valproate was added and led to substantial improvement. Averaging in the spectral domain may reveal frequency-specific changes that may not be otherwise appreciated in the time domain. Future studies may elucidate the effect on the sensitivity of diagnosis of simple partial seizures and auras.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Rafeed Alkawadri"", ids = ""5007894""); list(name = ""Nicolas Gaspard"", ids = ""2623908"")",dca9f61781c2cdd9d7bb9a580f755af43f9deea6,,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,20 2,"

3ee701fbca656760cb981999a3a4d4be9248b5d2,Proteomic Analysis Identifies Tenascin-C Expression Is Upregulated in Uterine Fibroids,"Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common gynecological tumors, which are enriched in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibroids are leading cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and hysterectomy. One of the major questions yet to be answered is the overproduction of specific ECM components in human uterine fibroids, particularly in relation to mutations in the driver gene mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12). Surgical specimens from 14 patients with uterine leiomyoma having fibroids and corresponding adjacent normal myometrium (ANM) were utilized to analyze genetic and proteomic expression patterns in the tissue samples. MED12 mutations in the fibroids were screened by Sanger sequencing. iTRAQ was used to label the peptides in small-, medium-, and large-sized fibroid samples of annotated MED12 mutation from the same patient. The mixtures of the peptides were fractionated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and analyzed by liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the differential expression proteins. Using isobaric tagged-based quantitative mass spectrometry on 3 selected patients, ECM-related protein tenascin-C (TNC) was observed significantly upregulated (>1.5-fold) with a confidence corresponding to false discovery rate (FDR) <1% in small-, medium-, and large-sized fibroid samples regardless of MED12 mutation status. The TNC was validated on additional patient samples using Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confirmed significant overexpression of this protein in fibroids compared to matched ANM. Proteomic analyses have identified the increased ECM protein expression, TNC, as a hallmark of uterine fibroids regardless of MED12 mutations. Further functional studies focusing on the upregulated ECM proteins in leiomyogenesis will lead to the identification of novel ECM drug targets for fibroid treatment.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""M Fairuz B Jamaluddin"", ids = ""144713035""); list(name = ""Prathima B.

569ad4ef16507384c92f66259b1aba42a2f7996e,"Detection of Quantitative Trait Loci Affecting Haematological Traits on Swine Chromosomes 2,7 and 8","Haematological traits, which consist of mainly three components: leukocyte traits, erythrocyte traits and platelet traits, play extremely important role in disease resistance. But knowledge of the genetic background controlling variability of these immune traits is very limited, especially in swine. 18 haematological traits including white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophilic granulocyte count (GRAN) and percentage (GR%), lymphocyte count (LYMF) and percentage (LY% ), monocytes count (MONO) and percentage (MO% ), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concerntration (MCHC), red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW), blood platelet counts (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and plateletocrit (PCT) were measured in a pig resource population consisting of 368 piglets of three breeds (Landrace, Large White and Songliao Black Pig) distributed in 16 boar families, after inoculation with the swine fever vaccine at 21 days of old. A partial genome scan for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these traits was performed using 35 microsatellite markers on chromosomes 2, 7, and 8. Using variance component analysis based on a linear mixed model and likelihood ratio test based on a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, 22 significant QTL (P 5%) were identified: 9 on chromosome 2 affecting WBC, GRAN, MCV, HGB, MCHC, PLT, MPV, PDW and PCT, respectively; 7 on chromosome 7 affecting WBC, GRAN, MCHC, HGB, PLT, MCV and RDW, respectively; 6 on chromosome 8 affecting GR% , LY% , MCHC, PLT, PCT and MCV, respectively. In order to avoid the increase of false positive rate caused by multiple tests, the FDR (false discovery rate) control approach was adopted to further test these 22 QTL. The results indicated that 14 of them were significant at FDR 5% level, of which 9 were significant at FDR1% level.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""G. X.-Z.

2704db65f5396b65ea4796ef0a14f98603442675,A two-stage microbial association mapping framework with advanced FDR control,"BackgroundIn microbiome studies, it is important to detect taxa which are associated with pathological outcomes at the lowest definable taxonomic rank, such as genus or species. Traditionally, taxa at the target rank are tested for individual association, followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure to control for false discovery rate (FDR). However, this approach neglects the dependence structure among taxa and may lead to conservative results. The taxonomic tree of microbiome data represents alignment from phylum to species rank and characterizes evolutionary relationships across microbial taxa. Taxa that are closer on the tree usually have similar responses to the exposure (environment). The statistical power in microbial association tests can be enhanced by efficiently employing the prior evolutionary information via the taxonomic tree.MethodsWe propose a two-stage microbial association mapping framework (massMap) which uses grouping information from the taxonomic tree to strengthen statistical power in association tests at the target rank. massMap first screens the association of taxonomic groups at a pre-selected higher taxonomic rank using a powerful microbial group test OMiAT. The method then proceeds to test the association for each candidate taxon at the target rank within the significant taxonomic groups identified in the first stage. Hierarchical BH (HBH) and selected subset testing (SST) procedures are evaluated to control the FDR for the two-stage structured tests.ResultsOur simulations show that massMap incorporating OMiAT and the advanced FDR controlling methodologies largely alleviates the multiplicity issue. It is statistically more powerful than the traditional association mapping directly at the target rank while controlling the FDR at desired levels under most scenarios. In our real data analyses, massMap detects more or the same amount of associated species with smaller adjusted p values compared to the traditional method, which further illustrates the efficiency of the proposed framework. The R package of massMap is publicly available at https://sites.google.com/site/huilinli09/software and https://github.com/JiyuanHu/.ConclusionsmassMap is a novel microbial association mapping framework and achieves additional efficiency by utilizing the intrinsic taxonomic structure of microbiome data.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jiyuan Hu"", ids = ""50830335""); list(name = ""Hyunwook Koh"", ids = ""46741006""); list(name = ""Linchen He"", ids = ""50671080""); list(name = ""Menghan Liu"", ids = ""47842564""); list(name = ""Martin J.

a345d8c4282740c3bf7fd5fde2aa157f93a1d6a0,Genetic Mapping with Background Control for Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) in 8-Parental Pure-Line Populations,"Multi-parental advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations provide abundant genetic variation for use in plant genetics and breeding. In this study, we developed a method for quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection in pure-line populations derived from eight-way crosses, based on the principles of inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). We considered eight parents carrying different alleles with different effects. To estimate the eight genotypic effects, one-locus genetic model was first built. Then, an orthogonal linear model of phenotypes against marker variables was established to explain genetic effects of the locus. The linear model was estimated by stepwise regression and finally used for phenotype adjustment and background genetic variation control in QTL mapping. Simulation studies using three genetic models demonstrated that the proposed method had higher detection power, lower false discovery rate (FDR), and unbiased estimation of QTL locations compared with other methods.

While various spectrum-spectrum match scores exist, the field lacks statistical methods for estimating the false discovery rates (FDR) of these annotations. We present empirical Bayes and target-decoy based methods to estimate the false discovery rate. Relying on estimations of false discovery rates, we explore the effect of different spectrum-spectrum match criteria on the number and the nature of the molecules annotated. We show that the spectral matching settings needs to be adjusted for each project. By adjusting the scoring parameters and thresholds, the number of annotations rose, on average, by +139% (ranging from âˆ’92% up to +5705%) when compared to a default parameter set available at GNPS. The FDR estimation methods presented will enable a user to define the scoring criteria for large scale analysis of untargeted small molecule data that has been essential in the advancement of large scale proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics science.",2017,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kerstin Scheubert"", ids = ""2453285""); list(name = ""Franziska Hufsky"", ids = ""3312486""); list(name = ""Daniel Petras"", ids = ""4019733""); list(name = ""Mingxun Wang"", ids = ""1949898""); list(name = ""Louis-FÃ©lix Nothias"", ids = ""10790574""); list(name = ""Kai DÃ¼hrkop"", ids = ""2178853""); list(name = ""Nuno Bandeira"", ids = ""2865038""); list(name = ""Pieter C.

c1531795ce1c289b5df1a558ca443a607b19e3f0,Effect of high ambient temperature and genotype on thermoregulatory responses and gene expression in various tissues in growing pigs,"Heat stress (HS) in pig production is a critical problem in
temperate countries during summer but also in tropical areas
where pig production dramatically increased over the past 2
decades. Physiological and metabolic adjustments resulting
from the thermoregulatory responses to HS have negative consequences
on pig productivity and health. The objectives of this
experiment were to improve knowledge on the mechanisms
underlining heat tolerance by comparing thermoregulatory
responses in 3 different pig genotypes (G). This experiment
was performed on a total of 36 castrated male pigs: 1 genotype
sensitive to HS (Large White [LW]), 1 genotype tolerant to
HS (Creole [CR]), and a cross between LW and CR pigs. Pigs
were housed at 24Â°C for 10 d and thereafter at 32Â°C for 5 d.
The temperature (T) transition from 24 to 32Â°C occurred on d
0 at a constant rate of 2Â°C/h. Pigs had free access to water and
feed. Body T and respiratory rate were measured on d â€“7, â€“4,
and â€“3 at 24Â°C and on d 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 at 32Â°C. Eighteen pigs
(6 per G) were slaughtered on d â€“2 (before the T transition) and
on d 5. At slaughter, blood and 3 tissue samples (backfat [BF],
longissimus dorsi [LD], and liver [LI]) were collected. A transcriptome
analysis was performed on blood and tissues using
a semicustom 60K microarray (GPL16524). Blood hormones
and metabolites were also measured. The T Ã— G interaction
was not significant (P > 0.05) for feed intake and thermoregulatory
responses (except for skin T). Whatever the G, HS had
a significant negative effect on voluntary feed intake (â€“200 g/d
on average). The T increase resulted in an increased rectal and
skin T and respiratory rate within the first 24 to 72 h of exposure
and in a subsequent recovery phase characterized by
a rapid decrease of these thermoregulatory responses. Plasma
glucose, lactate, glycerol, and albumin concentrations were
significantly reduced under HS but creatine concentration increased
at 32Â°C. Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine and thyroxine)
concentrations were reduced at 32Â°C. Irrespective to
the G, a considerable number of differentially expressed genes
(false discovery rate < 0.05) were found by comparing blood
(13,807), LD (6,261), BF (5,236), and LI (435) samples collected
at 24Â°C with those collected at 32Â°C. A first functional
analysis revealed that most of the significantly differentially
expressed genes especially in BF and LD were involved in the
regulation of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""David Renaudeau"", ids = ""86929542""); list(name = ""Jean-Luc Gourdine"", ids = ""144713763""); list(name = ""Laurence Liaubet"", ids = ""6191826""); list(name = ""HÃ©lÃ¨ne Gilbert"", ids = ""1981799""); list(name = ""Juliette Riquet"", ids = ""4903860"")",,,,,

Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health concern that affects millions of children annually. Mild TBI tends to result in subtle and diffuse alterations in brain tissue, which challenges accurate clinical detection and prognostication. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) holds promise as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, but little research has examined DTI in post-acute mild TBI. The current study compared post-acute white matter microstructure in children with mild TBI versus those with mild orthopedic injury (OI), and examined whether post-acute DTI metrics can predict post-acute and chronic post-concussive symptoms (PCS).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Children aged 8-16.99 years with mild TBI (nÂ =Â 132) or OI (nÂ =Â 69) were recruited at emergency department visits to two children's hospitals, during which parents rated children's pre-injury symptoms retrospectively. Children completed a post-acute (<2 weeks post-injury) assessment, which included a 3T MRI, and 3- and 6-month post-injury assessments. Parents and children rated PCS at each assessment. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from diffusion-weighted MRI using Automatic Fiber Quantification software. Multiple multivariable linear and negative binomial regression models were used to test study aims, with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
No significant group differences were found in any of the 20 white matter tracts after FDR correction. DTI metrics varied by age and sex, and site was a significant covariate. No interactions involving group, age, and sex were significant. DTI metrics in several tracts robustly predicted PCS ratings at 3- and 6-months post-injury, but only corpus callosum genu MD was significantly associated with post-acute PCS after FDR correction. Significant group by DTI metric interactions on chronic PCS ratings indicated that left cingulum hippocampus and thalamic radiation MD was positively associated with 3-month PCS in the OI group, but not in the mild TBI group.


CONCLUSIONS
Post-acute white matter microstructure did not differ for children with mild TBI versus OI after correcting for multiple comparisons, but was predictive of post-acute and chronic PCS in both injury groups. These findings support the potential prognostic utility of this advanced DTI technique.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ashley L Ware"", ids = ""38865324""); list(name = ""Ayushi Shukla"", ids = ""40902211""); list(name = ""Naomi J Goodrich-Hunsaker"", ids = ""1397972951""); list(name = ""Catherine Lebel"", ids = ""152638522""); list(name = ""Elisabeth A.

02ff401d15912b92acb237eb9e50d58a432c7c33,Bile acid aspiration associated with lung chemical profile linked to other biomarkers of injury after lung transplantation.,"Aspiration of gastrointestinal contents has been linked to worse outcomes following lung transplantation but uncertainty exists about underlying mechanisms. We applied high-resolution metabolomics of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in patients with episodic aspiration (defined by bile acids in the BALF) to identify potential metabolic changes associated with aspiration. Paired samples, one with bile acids and another without, from 29 stable lung transplant patients were studied. Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectroscopy was used to interrogate metabolomic contents of these samples. Data were obtained for 7068 ions representing intermediary metabolites, environmental agents and chemicals associated with microbial colonization. A substantial number (2302) differed between bile acid positive and negative samples when analyzed by false discovery rate at q = 0.01. These included pathways associated with microbial metabolism. Hierarchical cluster analysis defined clusters of chemicals associated with bile acid aspiration that were correlated to previously reported biomarkers of lung injury including T cell granzyme B level and the chemoattractants CXCL9 and CXCL10. These data specifically link bile acids presence in lung allografts to inflammatory pathways known to segregate with worsening allograft outcome, and provide additional mechanistic insight into the association between reflux and lung allograft injury.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""David C.

921a2a193ceafdd82ac860008a305ce0802a36b9,"Genome-wide association study of borderline personality disorder reveals genetic overlap with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia","Borderline personality disorder (BOR) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, and characterized by affective instability and impulsivity, diagnostic symptoms also observed in manic phases of bipolar disorder (BIP). Up to 20% of BIP patients show comorbidity with BOR. This report describes the first case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BOR, performed in one of the largest BOR patient samples worldwide. The focus of our analysis was (i) to detect genes and gene sets involved in BOR and (ii) to investigate the genetic overlap with BIP. As there is considerable genetic overlap between BIP, major depression (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) and a high comorbidity of BOR and MDD, we also analyzed the genetic overlap of BOR with SCZ and MDD. GWAS, gene-based tests and gene-set analyses were performed in 998 BOR patients and 1545 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to detect the genetic overlap between BOR and these disorders. Single marker analysis revealed no significant association after correction for multiple testing. Gene-based analysis yielded two significant genes: DPYD (P=4.42 Ã— 10-7) and PKP4 (P=8.67 Ã— 10-7); and gene-set analysis yielded a significant finding for exocytosis (GO:0006887, PFDR=0.019; FDR, false discovery rate). Prior studies have implicated DPYD, PKP4 and exocytosis in BIP and SCZ. The most notable finding of the present study was the genetic overlap of BOR with BIP (rg=0.28 [P=2.99 Ã— 10-3]), SCZ (rg=0.34 [P=4.37 Ã— 10-5]) and MDD (rg=0.57 [P=1.04 Ã— 10-3]). We believe our study is the first to demonstrate that BOR overlaps with BIP, MDD and SCZ on the genetic level. Whether this is confined to transdiagnostic clinical symptoms should be examined in future studies.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephanie H.

However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Pre-existing methods for pseudotime estimation have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.",2016,Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kieran R.

07cb661a5fa220ca00d7628d49bab9bb49b56ddc,Coexpression and expression quantitative trait loci analyses of the angiogenesis gene-gene interaction network in prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PCa) shows a substantial clinical heterogeneity. The existing risk classification for PCa prognosis based on clinical factors is not sufficient. Although some biomarkers for PCa aggressiveness have been identified, their underlying functional mechanisms are still unclear. We previously reported a gene-gene interaction network associated with PCa aggressiveness based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP interactions in the angiogenesis pathway. The goal of this study is to investigate potential functional evidence of the involvement of the genes in this gene-gene interaction network.


METHODS
A total of 11 angiogenesis genes were evaluated. The crosstalks among genes were examined through coexpression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. The study population is 352 Caucasian PCa patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study. The pairwise coexpressions among the genes of interest were evaluated using the Spearman coefficient. The eQTL analyses were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis test.


RESULTS
Among all within gene and 55 possible pairwise gene evaluations, 12 gene pairs and one gene (MMP16) showed strong coexpression or significant eQTL evidence. There are nine gene pairs with a strong correlation (Spearman correlation â‰¥0.6, P<1Ã—10-13). The top coexpressed gene pairs are EGFR-SP1 (r=0.73), ITGB3-HSPG2 (r=0.71), ITGB3-CSF1 (r=0.70), MMP16-FBLN5 (r=0.68), ITGB3-MMP16 (r=0.65), ITGB3-ROBO1 (r=0.62), CSF1-HSPG2 (r=0.61), CSF1-FBLN5 (r=0.6), and CSF1-ROBO1 (r=0.60). One cis-eQTL in MMP16 and five trans-eQTLs (MMP16-ESR1, ESR1-ROBO1, CSF1-ROBO1, HSPG2-ROBO1, and FBLN5-CSF1) are significant with a false discovery rate q value less than 0.2.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings provide potential biological evidence for the gene-gene interactions in this angiogenesis network.

ebcdc693ad0406fb4f89848ad0bbf14d0c991116,In culture cross-linking of bacterial cells reveals proteome scale dynamic protein-protein interactions at the peptide level,"Identification of dynamic protein-protein interactions at the peptide level on a proteomic scale is a challenging approach that is still in its infancy. We have developed a system to cross-link cells directly in culture with the special lysine cross-linker bis(succinimidyl)-3-azidomethyl-glutarate (BAMG). We used the Gram positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis as an exemplar system. Within 5 min extensive intracellular cross-linking was detected, while intracellular cross-linking in a Gram-negative species, Escherichia coli, was still undetectable after 30 min, in agreement with the low permeability in this organism for lipophilic compounds like BAMG. We were able to identify 82 unique inter-protein cross-linked peptides with less than a 1% false discovery rate by mass spectrometry and genome-wide data base searching. Nearly 60% of the inter-protein cross-links occur in assemblies involved in transcription and translation. Several of these interactions are new, and we identified a binding site between the Î´ and Î²â€² subunit of RNA polymerase close to the downstream DNA channel, providing a clue into how Î´ might regulate promoter selectivity and promote RNA polymerase recycling. Our methodology opens new avenues to investigate the functional dynamic organization of complex protein assemblies involved in bacterial growth.",2017,Biology,"list(name = ""Luitzen de Jong"", ids = ""2008118""); list(name = ""Edward A. de Koning"", ids = ""32325072""); list(name = ""Winfried Roseboom"", ids = ""4546447""); list(name = ""Hansuk Buncherd"", ids = ""47955858""); list(name = ""Martin J.

6d728c44203a81bef90feb72eec4a3f68bbc0c19,No Evidence for Systematic White Matter Correlates of Dyslexia: An Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-Analysis,"Dyslexia is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by reading and spelling difficulties. Beyond the behavioral and functional correlates of this condition, a growing number of studies have explored structural differences between individuals with dyslexia and typically developing individuals. To date, findings remain disparate â€“ some studies suggest differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), an indirect measure of white matter integrity, whereas others do not identify significant disparities. Here, we synthesized the existing literature on this topic by conducting a meta-analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies investigating white matter correlates of dyslexia via voxel-based analyses (VBA) of FA. Our results showed no reliable clusters underlying differences between dyslexics and typical individuals, after correcting for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate correction). Because group comparisons might be too coarse to yield subtle differences, we further explored differences in FA as a function of reading ability, measured on a continuous scale. Consistent with our initial findings, reading ability was not associated with reliable differences in white matter integrity. These findings nuance the current view of profound, structural differences underlying reading ability and its associated disorders, and suggest that their neural correlates might be more subtle than previously thought.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""David Moreau"", ids = ""145171539""); list(name = ""Josephine E.

ce0051f3293d7668c6199fa34118ee1301c638d8,A refined method to calculate false discovery rates for peptide identification using decoy databases.,"Using decoy databases to estimate the number of false positive assignations is one of the most widely used methods to calculate false discovery rates in large-scale peptide identification studies. However, in spite of their widespread use, the decoy approach has not been fully standardized. In conjunction with target databases, decoy databases may be used separately or in the form of concatenated databases, allowing a competition strategy; depending on the method used, two alternative formulations are possible to calculate error rates. Although both methods are conservative, the separate database approach overestimates the number of false positive assignations due to the presence of MS/MS spectra produced by true peptides, while the concatenated approach calculates the error rate in a population that has a higher size than that obtained after searching a target database. In this work, we demonstrate that by analyzing as a whole the joint distribution of matches obtained after performing a separate database search, and applying the competition strategy, it is possible to make a more accurate calculation of false discovery rates. We show that both separate and concatenated approaches clearly overestimate error rates with respect to those calculated by the new algorithm, using several kinds of scores. We conclude that the new indicator provides a more sensitive alternative, and establishes for the first time a unique and integrated framework to calculate error rates in large-scale peptide identification studies.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Pedro Pozo Navarro"", ids = ""103400351""); list(name = ""JesÃºs VÃ¡zquez"", ids = ""144727873"")",94e1d7d224e1ba363b7faa79c297fadf759f8ef8; 3d52e942bb724798ec00919e9f834a4d4850319b; b208a078162f898fe894b36791c0bfd8db71aa92; 7a21532ac4e0b61ae126754c9312d78dfa356874; 14cb14ef79cfca69adfa079b806a17d16735bb90; 2e924e42d3f86ae9d57513ceec30bac5e0be47a0; 6492918286fa1858d7088535a4789423a7e34f38; ef7da80794713df38307050bc4c1759f8da8b204; 69535a00214bb9b4a07e271dc3fbce0f64735fbb; db288444a2e8c096a67487f88f22481ce47505aa; f7c4c5c13f1f5f5de9d80c4b5b2f2bd733929438; 54c69539a3a4468aa6edf559b151104aca4ad210; 44f0b71853658a34bb038be11da352a54ed96c28; 33bf2456e2bc2af50e7eed582f93b2861b91a19b; e5908569b96278f16c9a6ab56a4b0d0dcb9f83e4; c8be23ef7d5611969139a4d5d7fef4b58efd2acb; 38f4a9945d9075a0405f6e044607fc7fecee7953; 591407aaee13620ebb0d7138563f06051cc118fb; 9d4b7edb970c2922fcabb2aa189345fd31ad0b71; 127754d8681f91fba122cdce1c55c4658efd08af; d05eff09e4402667a696074a231c87b62750c9d4; fbc6427f95e4779b926e7e50d921cc0f5d79729c; b2f737b5833782aef526408bedb757803133ab88; 0faeca6e9cbbaf67bf9bbe26ebeaf76c29e705d5; d12dbedd09bc06c6f524da865abc1feec8fe33bf; f393df4bbba1ce50912d84a73255906b168f52df; 84e1aa17d2f19c123bc937f344d4785800d5aa49; b158aec580eb587f1854f838e1e651d37d1689e1; 3de2df0deb8d8f8f9d7787ff010cd407890bb199; e2ac09a0dab0b4767a4e98cadb7370c3b3df165e; 54cd31fcb3ae4aa7b6d5242103d54466bd550f23; d6b2d54151e00b1215061dcde87cf146da5d61d7; 3e2589785139ea126722e5c379c7976f68d22983; f55781157f01ccb07242080a59d4364829d73323; 6a93ef37c6d5cd42bb8fbc9a6d4ececf1c933f9e; f535b3891f35fb7698bc8696d3b7166c82b3af9b; cf24c819d5bb518bdce05aca32a2d42aa2cc99b7; 84578ee8c68ecdfab7c0f85bfd5e576b5b20347c; cd56c3e426092dc73c951079a610f7060efcb555; e712b0f707fc28499fbbbc3d1a54411e56f52723; d028bbdfc6d2c0d52ed8a5d96267a18eb3747877; a6f5ca5c369c61bfff8391eab075db371f95c314; 235d4975c45bb7dc386d10ae0c18580d10e643c0; f1e69063b15769e3638ac35972148cb527f172e1; 64358ca8b1c7696d20faf8030334df17887a8e23; 432e56f238f0b781fb9a2d10063a9d5a98930d18; e6dcc4702504d4588cc13ea734d3524aa3d58475; 989b9bd66fecdf62494a1aef6c721dea257b169b; 1f7b2333ef4231dc1ac8311358c8d49800809756; c773a0114e20c1cb8a94186c9a285d0d307af837; 441129629cb3c3ee104bbff6109add279293efed; d94fccceb29355607b1c378303e350bb35a7c86c; 62df65a688cc355328443590d78cd765851e1e4e; 1b9d5dbaa4bea586a8a68acad794b4359550b994; 7001a4515f9547470848b13c9f3e141489c81c68; 5995a40a2ec6f86e2095df8244d23902434552ad; eea8ffcbd7d006da3664dd30fb662d18b7d2bc8f; 8381d40cf14c17f692837b5a3051fe260f4ac0d3; 362049557df1985f132e2a078df97e7477fdec1d; af7bf9b1a6ec1335cbf64ab1815bdad5d33a9b29; a87d43b5d4902ec4831556497ccd1587ec3dae30; 890eb6f711e593c88f65f0256903f00bc4904971; bf707b6b130d5b5a1fbb180925cef1811d7ad7ab; 1fb43316e819db59c9e13a119ca110eb973846b6; 2db4184a9defac27c39a10703254c7285c53cd42; bfaf760ed0ac82fd9b8150aaf30841ece4698e77; 9854c642b5a5999e9a6febbf1ac0fd603c24785e; a83cdf7126efa61bac2dde04bae884f005d8f903; 0f39ed6ad6daa6763e7c0c1c20c49db541e85e5f; d228b22c3d9f585dcd056cc1dbfd902e763c3780; 2e8079ae4289f65fe390a45f86ab373d86125275; 40f1b2df7d6d3f1374c7846a3eb341c5e3ec000b,2551f5f20953719f91d69344cd023d78ac591c4e; 66f07af0079b4683ca5a0138f13b7c15a91d1406; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; e6ff5a0111a42c5ea20f7ce9716024047cc694c4; 1ef83b2b980b406db708adb6104533be05af9854; 64c1b6c4b4b027c5b1b89023b9a135797c8098fe; 96f9f7ddce258fc85e3b1532b7471e2c4c640fd7,Journal of proteome research,8 4,"

b16ce7f3e60ba0a157036d48f5fe6967bbab8619,An iterative workflow for mining the human intestinal metaproteome,"BackgroundPeptide spectrum matching (PSM) is the standard method in shotgun proteomics data analysis. It relies on the availability of an accurate and complete sample proteome that is used to make interpretation of the spectra feasible. Although this procedure has proven to be effective in many proteomics studies, the approach has limitations when applied on complex samples of microbial communities, such as those found in the human intestinal tract. Metagenome studies have indicated that the human intestinal microbiome contains over 100 times more genes than the human genome and it has been estimated that this ecosystem contains over 5000 bacterial species. The genomes of the vast majority of these species have not yet been sequenced and hence their proteomes remain unknown. To enable data analysis of shotgun proteomics data using PSM, and circumvent the lack of a defined matched metaproteome, an iterative workflow was developed that is based on a synthetic metaproteome and the developing metagenomic databases that are both representative for but not necessarily originating from the sample of interest.ResultsTwo human fecal samples for which metagenomic data had been collected, were analyzed for their metaproteome using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and used to benchmark the developed iterative workflow to other methods. The results show that the developed method is able to detect over 3,000 peptides per fecal sample from the spectral data by circumventing the lack of a defined proteome without naive translation of matched metagenomes and cross-species peptide identification.ConclusionsThe developed iterative workflow achieved an approximate two-fold increase in the amount of identified spectra at a false discovery rate of 1% and can be applied in metaproteomic studies of the human intestinal tract or other complex ecosystems.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Koos Rooijers"", ids = ""4453392""); list(name = ""Carolin A.

We used genome-wide genotype data from 268 African Americans (AAs: 129 AD cases and 139 controls) and 143 European Americans (EAs: 129 AD cases and 14 controls) to identify mQTLs that were associated with promoter CpGs in 82 AD risk genes. 282 significant mQTLâ€“CpG pairs (9.9Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’100Â â‰¤Â PnominalÂ â‰¤Â 7.7Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’8) in AAs and 313 significant mQTLâ€“CpG pairs (2.7Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’53Â â‰¤Â PnominalÂ â‰¤Â 9.9Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’8) in EAs were identified [i.e., mQTLâ€“CpG associations survived multiple-testing correction, q values (false discovery rate) â‰¤Â 0.05]. The most significant mQTL was rs1800759, which was strongly associated with CpG cg12011299 in both AAs (PnominalÂ =Â 9.9Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’100; qÂ =Â 6.7Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’91) and EAs (PnominalÂ =Â 2.7Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’53; qÂ =Â 1.4Â Ã—Â 10âˆ’44). Rs1800759 (previously known to be associated to AD) and CpG cg12011299 (distance: 37Â bp) are both located in alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 4 gene (ADH4) promoter region. In general, the strength of association between mQTLs and CpGs was inversely correlated with the distance between them. Association was also influenced by race and AD. Additionally, 48.3Â % of the mQTLs identified in AAs and 65.6Â % of the mQTLs identified in EAs were predicted to be expression QTLs. Three mQTLs (rs2173201, rs4147542, and rs4147541 in ADH1B-AHD1C gene cluster region) found in AAs were previously identified by our genome-wide association studies as being significantly associated with AD in AAs. Thus, DNA methylation, which can be influenced by sequence variants and is implicated in gene expression regulation, appears to at least partially underlie the association of genetic variation with AD.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Huiping Zhang"", ids = ""1708342""); list(name = ""Fan Wang"", ids = ""5898473""); list(name = ""Henry R.

6cc0f4d52c85237d07ab5335faf883f46778088d,Identification of differentially expressed genes using multi-resolution wavelet transformation analysis combined with SAM.,"Although many statistical methods have been proposed for identifying differentially expressed genes, the optimal approach has still not been resolved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more efficient methods of finding differentially expressed genes while accounting for noise and false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a method based on multi-resolution wavelet transformation analysis combined with SAM for identifying differentially expressed genes by adjusting the Î” and computing the FDR. This method was applied to a microarray expression dataset from adenoma patients and normal subjects.

bfbc26c37d6cb3f95edf4249f5a48b6331f13c40,Analysis of gene expression during the onset of muscle hypertrophy in callipyge lambs.,"The callipyge mutation causes postnatal muscle hypertrophy in heterozygous lambs that inherit a paternal callipyge allele (+/CLPG). Our hypothesis was that the up-regulation of one or both of the affected paternally expressed genes (DLK1 or PEG11) initiates changes in biochemical and physiological pathways in skeletal muscle to induce hypertrophy. The goal of this study was to identify changes in gene expression during the onset of muscle hypertrophy to identify the pathways that are involved in the expression of the callipyge phenotype. Gene expression was analysed in longissimus dorsi total RNA from lambs at 10, 20, and 30 days of age using the Affymetrix Bovine Expression Array. An average of 40.6% of probe sets on the array was detected in sheep muscle. Data were normalized and analysed using a two-way anova for genotype and age effects with a false discovery rate of 0.10. From the anova, 13 genes were significant for the effect of genotype and 13 were significant for effect of age (P < 0.10). No significant age-by-genotype interactions were detected (P > 0.10). Of the 13 genes indicating an effect of genotype, quantitative PCR assays were developed for all of them and tested on a larger group of animals from 10 to 200 days of age. Nine genes had significantly elevated transcript levels in callipyge lambs. These genes included phosphofructokinase, a putative methyltransferase protein, a cAMP phosphodiesterase, and the transcription factor DNTTIP1.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jolena N.

The value-at-risk forecast performance is investigated for different markets and industries, considering the test for correct conditional coverage using the false discovery rate (FDR) methodology. For most of the markets and industries we find the same two conclusions. First, an asymmetric GARCH specification is essential when forecasting the 95% value-at-risk. Second, for both the 95% and 99% value-at-risk it is crucial that the innovationsâ€™ distribution is fat-tailed (e.g., Student-t or â€“ even better â€“ a non-parametric kernel density estimate). Then we discuss two applications. First, we use normal Entropy Pooling to estimate a market distribution consistent with the CAPM equilibrium, which improves on the â€œimplied returnsâ€ a-la-Black and Litterman (1990) and can be used as the starting point for portfolio construction.

Atherosclerosis is a complex disease with hundreds of genes influencing its progression. In addition, the phenotype of the disease varies significantly depending on the arterial bed.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
We characterized the genes generally involved in human advanced atherosclerotic (AHA type V-VI) plaques in carotid and femoral arteries as well as aortas from 24 subjects of Tampere Vascular study and compared the results to non-atherosclerotic internal thoracic arteries (n=6) using genome-wide expression array and QRT-PCR. In addition we determined genes that were typical for each arterial plaque studied. To gain a comprehensive insight into the pathologic processes in the plaques we also analyzed pathways and gene sets dysregulated in this disease using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). According to the selection criteria used (>3.0 fold change and p-value <0.05), 235 genes were up-regulated and 68 genes down-regulated in the carotid plaques, 242 genes up-regulated and 116 down-regulated in the femoral plaques and 256 genes up-regulated and 49 genes down-regulated in the aortic plaques. Nine genes were found to be specifically induced predominantly in aortic plaques, e.g., lactoferrin, and three genes in femoral plaques, e.g., chondroadherin, whereas no gene was found to be specific for carotid plaques. In pathway analysis, a total of 28 pathways or gene sets were found to be significantly dysregulated in atherosclerotic plaques (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.25).


CONCLUSIONS
This study describes comprehensively the gene expression changes that generally prevail in human atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, site specific genes induced only in femoral or aortic plaques were found, reflecting that atherosclerotic process has unique features in different vascular beds.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mari Levula"", ids = ""5836791""); list(name = ""Niku Oksala"", ids = ""50393398""); list(name = ""Nina Airla"", ids = ""4619422""); list(name = ""Rainer Zeitlin"", ids = ""145466508""); list(name = ""Juha-Pekka Salenius"", ids = ""120520321""); list(name = ""Otso JÃ¤rvinen"", ids = ""47292398""); list(name = ""Maarit Venermo"", ids = ""1871398""); list(name = ""Teemu Partio"", ids = ""5381274""); list(name = ""Jukka T.

493fb60f449846b4b6a38fb951e989d75dc64593,Topological FDR for neuroimaging,"In this technical note, we describe and validate a topological false discovery rate (FDR) procedure for statistical parametric mapping. This procedure is designed to deal with signal that is continuous and has, in principle, unbounded spatial support. We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an SPM and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error (FWE) control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise FDR procedures. Our results suggest that (a) FDR control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than FWE control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise FDR is substantially less accurate than topological FWE or FDR control.

1cade48f4677e6863148988a6fc96ed34c8e91a8,Sample size calculation for microarray experiments with blocked one-way design,"BackgroundOne of the main objectives of microarray analysis is to identify differentially expressed genes for different types of cells or treatments. Many statistical methods have been proposed to assess the treatment effects in microarray experiments.ResultsIn this paper, we consider discovery of the genes that are differentially expressed among K (> 2) treatments when each set of K arrays consists of a block. In this case, the array data among K treatments tend to be correlated because of block effect. We propose to use the blocked one-way ANOVA F-statistic to test if each gene is differentially expressed among K treatments. The marginal p-values are calculated using a permutation method accounting for the block effect, adjusting for the multiplicity of the testing procedure by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). We propose a sample size calculation method for microarray experiments with a blocked one-way design.

e9d5de683cdee9ede1654a8225117345345d9cb1,A comparative evaluation of wavelet-based methods for hypothesis testing of brain activation maps,"Wavelet-based methods for hypothesis testing are described and their potential for activation mapping of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is investigated. In this approach, we emphasise convergence between methods of wavelet thresholding or shrinkage and the problem of hypothesis testing in both classical and Bayesian contexts. Specifically, our interest will be focused on the trade-off between type I probability error control and power dissipation, estimated by the area under the ROC curve. We describe a technique for controlling the false discovery rate at an arbitrary level of error in testing multiple wavelet coefficients generated by a 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of spatial maps of fMRI time series statistics. We also describe and apply change-point detection with recursive hypothesis testing methods that can be used to define a threshold unique to each level and orientation of the 2D-DWT, and Bayesian methods, incorporating a formal model for the anticipated sparseness of wavelet coefficients representing the signal or true image. The sensitivity and type I error control of these algorithms are comparatively evaluated by analysis of ""null"" images (acquired with the subject at rest) and an experimental data set acquired from five normal volunteers during an event-related finger movement task. We show that all three wavelet-based algorithms have good type I error control (the FDR method being most conservative) and generate plausible brain activation maps (the Bayesian method being most powerful). We also generalise the formal connection between wavelet-based methods for simultaneous multiresolution denoising/hypothesis testing and methods based on monoresolution Gaussian smoothing followed by statistical testing of brain activation maps.",2004,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohamed Jalal Fadili"", ids = ""46600702""); list(name = ""Edward T.

Pre-diagnostic lung cancer-related metabolic biomarkers may provide novel insights into lung cancer mechanisms, and may contribute to the discovery of etiologic factors for the high lung cancer prevalence among Asian women. We evaluated the role of the urinary metabolome in lung cancer development among female never-smokers in China by conducting a nested case-control study of 275 lung cancer cases and 289 healthy controls from the Shanghai Women9s Health Study, a prospective cohort comprised of 73,363 Chinese female never-smokers. Metabolic profiling of urinary chemical features was conducted using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) (39,409 spectral features) and 600 MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (386 features). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between each log-transformed metabolite level and lung cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, body mass index, history of respiratory disease and passive smoking. Spearman correlation and linear regression were used to estimate associations between the most significant metabolites and pre-diagnosis dietary factors. Three detected UPLC-MS urinary metabolites were negatively associated with lung cancer risk with a false discovery rate of less than 10%: pos_2.61_127.0382m/z (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.46-0.72, P = 1.98 x 10-6), neg_2.60_369.0408m/z (OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96-0.98, P = 1.36 x 10-6), and pos_2.61_184.0325n (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.43-0.71, P = 4.91 x 10-6).

744251481e1d82ee4994dadb1affdefab9b5c5bb,Association of KASP markers with Hessian fly resistance in wheat of diverse origin,"Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor (Say)) is a major pest in wheat producing areas of United States, Canada, Europe, and North Africa but has not been found in Australia. Host plant resistance is thought to involve a similar strategy used against plant pathogen, and in this study, we sought to investigate whether disease-resistance gene markers can also be useful in selecting against Hessian fly attack. The genome-wide association study involved 251 wheat genotypes of diverse origin and 72 SNPs, selected on the basis of significant similarity of their associated contig sequences to putative disease resistance genes. A novel statistical approach for genome-wide scan was applied, which utilised genotype data scored as Null alleles in the mixed model, instead of deleting or treating them as missing alleles. The analyses identified four markers with significant associations at the 5% level, after applying the false discovery rate. These were located on chromosomes 4A, 4B, 5A and 7D, with the 5A locus mapping to the cluster of major genes that confer resistance to multiple Hessian fly biotypes. Amongst the diverse wheat accessions analysed, most of the susceptible phenotypes carried the Aâ€“Gâ€“Câ€“C haplotype at the BS00064369, BS00007416, BS00077047 and HfrDrd_nt_143 loci, respectively. When heterozygotes were excluded, all the Australian wheat accessions carried this allelic combination.

0a75df96239856fe525b37fb29b9d1b13ff10413,Knockoff Boosted Tree for Model-Free Variable Selection,"In this article, we propose a novel strategy for conducting variable selection without prior model topology knowledge using the knockoff method with boosted tree models. Our method is inspired by the original knockoff method, where the differences between original and knockoff variables are used for variable selection with false discovery rate control. The original method uses Lasso for regression models and assumes there are more samples than variables. We extend this method to both model-free and high-dimensional variable selection. We propose two new sampling methods for generating knockoffs, namely the sparse covariance and principal component knockoff methods. We test these methods and compare them with the original knockoff method in terms of their ability to control type I errors and power. The boosted tree model is a complex system and has more hyperparameters than models with simpler assumptions. In our framework, these hyperparameters are either tuned through Bayesian optimization or fixed at multiple levels for trend detection. In simulation tests, we also compare the properties and performance of importance test statistics of tree models. The results include combinations of different knockoffs and importance test statistics. We also consider scenarios that include main-effect, interaction, exponential, and second-order models while assuming the true model structures are unknown. We apply our algorithm for tumor purity estimation and tumor classification using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) gene expression data.

74a2c713809043437645ba5f2ad5ed83b25cb612,Data and text mining Microbial genotype â€“ phenotype mapping by class association rule mining,"Motivation: Microbial phenotypes are typically due to the concerted action of multiple gene functions, yet the presence of each gene may have only a weak correlation with the observed phenotype. Hence, it may be more appropriate to examine co-occurrence between sets of genes and a phenotype (multiple-to-one) instead of pairwise relations between a single gene and the phenotype. Here, we propose an efficient class association rule mining algorithm, NETCAR, in order to extract sets of COGs (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) associated with a phenotype from COG phylogenetic profiles and a phenotype profile. NETCAR takes into account the phylogenetic co-occurrence graph between COGs to restrict hypothesis space, and uses mutual information to evaluate the biconditional relation. Results: We examined the mining capability of pairwise and multiple-to-one association by using NETCAR to extract COGs relevant to six microbial phenotypes (aerobic, anaerobic, facultative, endospore, motility and Gram negative) from 11 969 unique COG profiles across 155 prokaryotic organisms. With the same level of false discovery rate, multiple-to-one association can extract about 10 times more relevant COGs than one-to-one association. We also reveal various topologies of association networks among COGs (modules) from extracted multiple-to-one correlation rules relevant with the six phenotypes; including a well-connected network for motility, a star-shaped network for aerobic and intermediate topologies for the other phenotypes. NETCAR outperforms a standard CAR mining algorithm, CARAPRIORI, while requiring several orders of magnitude less computational time for extracting 3-COG sets.

8a1e1f340cd16c0b376aaf6629c4bc3dc5650f33,Hunting for Significance With the False Discovery Rate,"When testing a single hypothesis, it is common knowledge that increasing the sample size after nonsignificant results and repeating the hypothesis test several times at unadjusted critical levels inflates the overall Type I error rate severely. In contrast, if a large number of hypotheses are tested controlling the False Discovery Rate, such â€œhunting for significanceâ€ has asymptotically no impact on the error rate. More specifically, if the sample size is increased for all hypotheses simultaneously and only the test at the final interim analysis determines which hypotheses are rejected, a data dependent increase of sample size does not affect the False Discovery Rate. This holds asymptotically (for an increasing number of hypotheses) for all scenarios but the global null hypothesis where all hypotheses are true. To control the False Discovery Rate also under the global null hypothesis, we consider stopping rules where stopping before a predefined maximum sample size is reached is possible only if sufficie...",2009,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Martin Posch"", ids = ""2470495""); list(name = ""Sonja Zehetmayer"", ids = ""77000601""); list(name = ""Peter Bauer"", ids = ""145849144"")",df30e5fef6177bb4ab9527270fdc64ee908858b1; e3159d253d3dc7497604a54f1a907afddbae2fee; 8c8a45d168dfa1c099dc4f1bfdceba81842fd044; 4a3fdd481386f7f61481af8822254cb90ded0f66; 15b4192d8024b0ef6db4d82ae131289e6e36b701; 2c7bc877184194406c757971ea12c602ccd7cf32; 3b6f86c18c2ac927332200acc56d0691ae2b5afe; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; c0af0e87f110d7d8ef4cd7790eaef7364348013f; 37c21a0937505d63a844204050455948b84c8a6a; 4daa0a95105a21de0490231ed102395ceff0a73e; c1fb5cbe9a010820e9ed79427ffae1198eee808f; 7670bcaad6933d39d15a560ccdfab881edb14053,,Journal of the American Statistical Association,104,832-840
a015ff9f733d6e8ac88a41abe6cdd2926a06f43b,"Clinical, radiographic, molecular and MRI-based predictors of cartilage loss in knee osteoarthritis.","OBJECTIVE
To examine the relationship of baseline clinical, radiographic, molecular and MRI measures with structural progression (subregional MRI-based femorotibial cartilage loss) in knee osteoarthritis (OA).


METHODS
Single knees of 75 female participants with radiographic knee OA (and 77 healthy control participants) were examined over 24 months using MRI. Subregional femorotibial cartilage thickness was determined at baseline and follow-up. Baseline clinical, radiographic, molecular (n=16) and quantitative MRI-based measures of the meniscus and cartilage, including delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI (dGEMRIC) and T2, were obtained. Differences in these baseline measures between radiographic osteoarthritic knees with longitudinal cartilage thinning (or thickening) and those with no significant change were evaluated by receiver operator characteristic analyses and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.


RESULTS
The relatively strongest predictors of longitudinal cartilage thinning were reduced baseline cartilage thickness in the medial femur (area under the curve (AUC)=0.81), varus malalignment (AUC=0.77), reduced minimum joint space width and a greater radiographic joint space narrowing (JSN) score (both AUC=0.74). These remained significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates. Reduced bone resorption (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; AUC=0.65) and a low dGEMRIC index (reflecting low proteoglycan content) in the medial tibia (AUC=0.68) were associated with longitudinal cartilage thinning, but failed to reach statistical significance after correction for multiple testing in this (small) sample.


CONCLUSIONS
This exploratory study indicates that baseline molecular or MRI cartilage compositional markers may not provide better discrimination between knees with cartilage thinning and those without longitudinal change than simple radiographic measures, such as greater JSN score.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Felix Eckstein"", ids = ""14956965""); list(name = ""M-P Hellio Le Graverand"", ids = ""10999355""); list(name = ""Hal Cecil Charles"", ids = ""2434769""); list(name = ""David J.

8cf3608dae2a35db6ab6fadf1437826f001dca5e,Advancing Top-down Analysis of the Human Proteome Using a Benchtop Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer.,"Over the past decade, developments in high resolution mass spectrometry have enabled the high throughput analysis of intact proteins from complex proteomes, leading to the identification of thousands of proteoforms. Several previous reports on top-down proteomics (TDP) relied on hybrid ion trap-Fourier transform mass spectrometers combined with data-dependent acquisition strategies. To further reduce TDP to practice, we use a quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument coupled with software for proteoform-dependent data acquisition to identify and characterize nearly 2000 proteoforms at a 1% false discovery rate from human fibroblasts. By combining a 3 m/z isolation window with short transients to improve specificity and signal-to-noise for proteoforms >30 kDa, we demonstrate improving proteome coverage by capturing 439 proteoforms in the 30-60 kDa range. Three different data acquisition strategies were compared and resulted in the identification of many proteoforms not observed in replicate data-dependent experiments. Notably, the data set is reported with updated metrics and tools including a new viewer and assignment of permanent proteoform record identifiers for inclusion of highly characterized proteoforms (i.e., those with C-scores >40) in a repository curated by the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Luca Fornelli"", ids = ""3824865""); list(name = ""Kenneth R.

f9e0d653a40d9adee8261e09e1f34a68b7a76161,Distinct pathways in the pathogenesis of sebaceous carcinomas implicated by differentially expressed microRNAs.,"IMPORTANCE
The molecular-genetic alterations contributing to the pathogenesis of sebaceous carcinoma and sebaceous adenoma remain poorly understood. Given that sebaceous carcinoma is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, there is a critical need to delineate the pathways driving sebaceous carcinoma and candidate molecules for targeted therapy.


OBJECTIVE
To describe differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in a series of periocular sebaceous carcinomas compared with sebaceous adenomas in order to identify pathways driving the pathogenesis of sebaceous carcinoma.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Thirty sebaceous carcinomas and 23 sebaceous adenomas (including 11 that were confirmed to be related to Muir-Torre syndrome and 6 that were confirmed to be sporadic) were obtained from archives (from 48 patients) of 2 institutions (University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand) and profiled.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Expression of miRNAs was determined using total RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction performed in a microfluidics card containing 378 unique miRNAs. Fold change was determined using the Î”Î”Ct method (reference probe, RNU48). Median centering was used to normalize the data. Two-sample t tests were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. The false discovery rate was assessed by Î²-uniform mixture analysis of P values from the t statistics. Significance was defined by this estimated false discovery rate.


RESULTS
Serial testing and validation confirmed overexpression of 2 miRNAs previously reported to be oncogenic, miR-486-5p (4.4-fold; Pâ€‰=â€‰2.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8) and miR-184 (3.5-fold; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10-6), in sebaceous carcinoma compared with sebaceous adenoma and downregulation of 2 miRNAs previously reported to have tumor-suppressive properties, miR-211 (-5.8-fold; Pâ€‰=â€‰2.3â€‰Ã—â€‰10-9) and miR-518d (-4.5-fold; 6.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5), in sebaceous carcinoma compared with sebaceous adenoma.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
Sebaceous carcinoma exhibits an miRNA expression profile distinct from that of sebaceous adenoma, implicating dysregulation of NF-ÎºB and PTEN (targets of miR-486-5p) and TGF-Î² signaling (target of miR-211) in the pathogenesis of sebaceous carcinoma. The identification of miRNAs whose expression is altered in sebaceous carcinoma compared with sebaceous adenoma provides a novel entry point for a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular-genetic alterations pivotal to the development of sebaceous carcinoma.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael T Tetzlaff"", ids = ""38083946""); list(name = ""Jonathan L Curry"", ids = ""2804599""); list(name = ""Vivian T.

cff93310655b87c097ea5cb095ec539191b84360,The Gut-Brain Axis in Healthy Females: Lack of Significant Association between Microbial Composition and Diversity with Psychiatric Measures,"OBJECTIVE
This study examined associations between the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and measures of depression, anxiety, eating disorder psychopathology, stress, and personality in a group of healthy adult females.


METHODS
Female participants (n = 91) ages 19-50 years with BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2 were recruited from central North Carolina between July 2014 and March 2015. Participants provided a single fecal sample and completed an online psychiatric questionnaire that included five measures: (i) Beck Anxiety Inventory; (ii) Beck Depression Inventory-II; (iii) Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire; (iv) Perceived Stress Scale; and (v) Mini International Personality Item Pool. Bacterial composition and diversity were characterized by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and associations were examined using Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient, in conjunction with Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate procedure.


RESULTS
We found no significant associations between microbial markers of gut composition and diversity and scores on psychiatric measures of anxiety, depression, eating-related thoughts and behaviors, stress, or personality in a large cohort of healthy adult females.


DISCUSSION
This study was the first specifically to examine associations between the intestinal microbiota and psychiatric measures in healthy females, and based on 16S rRNA taxonomic abundances and diversity measures, our results do not suggest a strong role for the enteric microbe-gut-brain axis in normal variation on responses to psychiatric measures in this population. However, the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathophysiology of psychiatric illness may be limited to more severe psychopathology.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Susan C Kleiman"", ids = ""48798414""); list(name = ""Emily C.

99276be9955f615bd07658109e12638e7578d8b3,Inferring combinatorial association logic networks in multimodal genome-wide screens,"MOTIVATION
We propose an efficient method to infer combinatorial association logic networks from multiple genome-wide measurements from the same sample. We demonstrate our method on a genetical genomics dataset, in which we search for Boolean combinations of multiple genetic loci that associate with transcript levels.


RESULTS
Our method provably finds the global solution and is very efficient with runtimes of up to four orders of magnitude faster than the exhaustive search. This enables permutation procedures for determining accurate false positive rates and allows selection of the most parsimonious model. When applied to transcript levels measured in myeloid cells from 24 genotyped recombinant inbred mouse strains, we discovered that nine gene clusters are putatively modulated by a logical combination of trait loci rather than a single locus. A literature survey supports and further elucidates one of these findings. Due to our approach, optimal solutions for multi-locus logic models and accurate estimates of the associated false discovery rates become feasible. Our algorithm, therefore, offers a valuable alternative to approaches employing complex, albeit suboptimal optimization strategies to identify complex models.

b0d0cd17e8e725852a6edc64bdc8b70584af9561,Disrupted pathways associated with neonatal sepsis: Combination of protein-protein interactions and pathway data,"To identify disrupted pathways associated with neonatal sepsis, we performed a research based on the combination of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and pathway data. Firstly, a total of 23,292 genes, 787,896 PPIs and 1,675 human pathways were obtained, respectively. Then, under the threshold value of false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05 and a delta cut-off value >4.36, a total of 986 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. In the following, by degree centrality for the objective PPI network, 20 hub genes were obtained. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis and randomization tests indicated that pathways of gene expression, immune system and innate immune system were with remarkable significance in neonatal sepsis. Therefore, in the present study, we presented a novel pathway method, and we successfully identified several pathways in neonatal sepsis, which might be underlying indicators in the detection and treatment of neonatal sepsis.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Xin Yong Qiao"", ids = ""16239485""); list(name = ""Silian Zhu"", ids = ""90557125""); list(name = ""Shujiao Zhang"", ids = ""90091412""); list(name = ""Hongmei Dong"", ids = ""26958377"")",0d15781db350a3127de213042794fb933f8b5efb,f520c530fa783ecb36d9ef60e29f2baee40d5751; b20ea0f47b1fa6ddf398f70b6c490620ad27dd34; f6841c262d25474fa6464bc2c640da0dda809329; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 3209e186b74189d721e66f2020c7829e7a3e7ccb; 3270c6d4ea39e4884d80e7e385e1b6386da15193; 8e78758a58430bbc515abfc43f97684a2001c41a; 85bcd929068b58d29d2c3bfceb5e17a61d156668; 8ac95c4795b9d3575fccb2a3d5a5fe2c922d594b; f47adbaaa4e5204e6976eb4d73ae245f12644427; f8dc73630864b4903f8f57b5c8d7b098eb300e4f; 637d489078253c29221e9997e738d28c23ba89f3; 503e171fd5f722236363b1ea32fcc4d8c1a60a23; 1838c2f527c00cce5c9726e904375c280f7f10cc; 3d1e58387b10b0209ac72cd03c177e3f90c743fb; a224f5044da7fd9b96eaf635534eb9090e0a32df; ceee6447b291f8052a28c9eb00ca360d6f39f9b1; 5903301093c7e31d5050404b29ccad8414fc0d29; 618235f5067d9847e759b0d0b97309b56ede4d3f; be3e63950ce1a455d389473c94d12c27ff698885; 721391d420ac35ad67cc8a44b1835ac331a49202; 485e73656366d96989e57801187dee2c3df8fe06; f0de5312a258191f995ef1d9463625ebe6547e99; 7bd0fe9b58b18da7414eba30b7155b02c5c188e5; b8104d5a0ca96a3febd9805beb1547faf7af66b2; be98e7a9c5e4beb5aaf8ffbf98892f86835ca52a; adcfb6d8d575831c500737351a0e8c1633b824c2; 4a92f809913c9e6d4f50b8ceaaf6bb7a5a43c8f7; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 961759e91b5a804edd85b8baf63c9e7649e886af; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; e5fb2d57e4ba3bf86a54fff420998566cfaa726f; cd118afb5b98caa191d206e9b2a5e1f8ff81bc1a; 3c8065c920cebe44a0462be36f086a4217de6a64,BioChip Journal,11,1-7
4c2fcb1f52418c8889afb47dd314dded059de907,SLIM: a sliding linear model for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses in datasets with dependence structures,"MOTIVATION
The pre-estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses (Ï€(0)) plays a critical role in controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing. However, hidden complex dependence structures of many genomics datasets distort the distribution of p-values, rendering existing Ï€(0) estimators less effective.


RESULTS
From the basic non-linear model of the q-value method, we developed a simple linear algorithm to probe local dependence blocks. We uncovered a non-static relationship between tests' p-values and their corresponding q-values that is influenced by data structure and Ï€(0). Using an optimization framework, these findings were exploited to devise a Sliding Linear Model (SLIM) to more reliably estimate Ï€(0) under dependence. When tested on a number of simulation datasets with varying data dependence structures and on microarray data, SLIM was found to be robust in estimating Ï€(0) against dependence. The accuracy of its Ï€(0) estimation suggests that SLIM can be used as a stand-alone tool for prediction of significant tests.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A comparative metabolomic analysis was used to identify metabolomic markers and metabolic pathways associated with MTX activity in vitro and in vivo. Cell-based studies assessed metabolomic profiles in K562 erythroblastoid cells with or without MTX treatment. In vivo analysis utilized plasma samples from JIA patients treated with MTX (n=30) and included samples collected prior to the initiation of MTX and after 3-months ofMTX treatment. Plasma samples were from an IRB-approved single center prospective cohort study of biomarkers of MTX response in patients with JIA and were stratified based on American College of Rheumatology pediatric (ACR Pedi) response criteria. Semi-targeted global metabolomic profiles including over 800 metabolites across three analytical platforms at the NIH West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC-Davis and were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis using MetaboAnalyst 3.0. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In K562 cells, MTX treatment was associated with statistically significant changes in 550 of the 850 intracellular metabolites detected (false discovery rate less than 0.05). Major metabolic pathways inhibited by MTX included branched-chain amino acid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, and lipid metabolism including the inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism. In patients with JIA, far fewer plasma metabolites were significantly altered following the initiation ofMTX and included only 15 of the 833 plasma metabolites detected. Interestingly, MTX treatment was associated with the inhibition of arachidonic acid synthesis, inhibition of purine metabolism, and a dramatic reduction in plasma levels of various exogenous metabolites. In particular, MTX treatment was associated reductions in known metabolic markers of intestinal microbiota metabolism, including: biotin and dehydrocholic acid. Further, stratification of patients based on ACR Pedi response demonstrated that clinical response was associated with a greater reduction in plasma dehydrocholic acid levels following the initiation of MTX. DISCUSSION/ SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: This work demonstrates that MTX therapy is associated with a number of biochemical changes in vitro and in vivo, including: inhibition of purine metabolism, inhibition of arachidonic acid metabolism, and an apparent inhibition of gut microbiota metabolism. Most notably, inhibition of gut microbiota metabolism appears to demonstrate a relationship with the observed clinical efficacy of MTX in JIA.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Moises A.

To identify genetic markers in immune-related pathways, we evaluated 3,985 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 230 candidate gene regions (adhesion-extravasation-migration, arachidonic acid metabolism/eicosanoid signaling, complement and coagulation cascade, cytokine signaling, innate pathogen detection and antimicrobials, leukocyte signaling, TNF/NF-kB pathway or other) in a case-control study of 344 PTC cases and 452 controls. We used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and calculate one degree of freedom P values of linear trend (P(SNP-trend) ) for the association between genotype (common homozygous, heterozygous, variant homozygous) and risk of PTC. To correct for multiple comparisons, we applied the false discovery rate method (FDR). Gene region- and pathway-level associations (P(Region) and P(Pathway)) were assessed by combining individual P(SNP-trend) values using the adaptive rank truncated product method. Two SNPs (rs6115, rs6112) in the SERPINA5 gene were significantly associated with risk of PTC (P(SNP-FDR)/P(SNP-trend)=â€Š0.02/6Ã—10(-6) and P(SNP-FDR)/P(SNP-trend)=â€Š0.04/2Ã—10(-5), respectively). These associations were independent of a history of autoimmune thyroiditis (ORâ€Š=â€Š6.4; 95% confidence interval: 3.0-13.4). At the gene region level, SERPINA5 was suggestively associated with risk of PTC (P(Region-FDR)/P(Region)=â€Š0.07/0.0003). Overall, the complement and coagulation cascade pathway was the most significant pathway (P(Pathway)=â€Š0.02) associated with PTC risk largely due to the strong effect of SERPINA5. Our results require replication but suggest that the SERPINA5 gene, which codes for the protein C inhibitor involved in many biological processes including inflammation, may be a new susceptibility locus for PTC.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Alina V.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are sub-micron, membrane-enclosed particles released into the circulation upon tissue injury or stress, and T-cell derived EVs have been shown to play a role in ACR pathophysiology. The molecular cargo of EVs are thought to reflect the state of their cell of origin and are therefore considered a potential source of biomarkers. The aim of this study was to profile immune-related proteins in isolated EVs from cardiac transplantation patients to identify novel biomarkers for ACR. Methods Plasma was collected serially from 8 cardiac allograft recipients before, during and after biopsy-proven ACR grade â‰¥2R (2 [25%] women, mean age 45.2 Â±21.2). EVs were isolated from plasma using acoustic seed trapping. The levels of 92 low-abundant immune-related proteins were assayed in plasma and EV lysates using a panel of proximity extension assays. Proteins that were dysregulated during ACR were identified by repeated measures ANOVA, adjusting for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate approach. The presence of EV proteins on leukocyte-, endothelial- and platelet-derived EVs was confirmed by co-staining of isolated EVs with antibodies specific for CD16, CD31 and CD41a, respectively, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results 48 proteins were defined as detected (i.e. above the limit of detection in >50% of samples) in the EV lysates. The levels of EV-proteins were overall poorly correlated with those in plasma: only 16.7 % of EV-proteins showed a significant correlation between plasma and EV lysates. The mean levels of 20 EV-proteins were numerically elevated during ACR. One of these, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), was significantly increased (q Conclusion The EV proteome is perturbed during ACR and differs substantially from that in corresponding plasma samples. The analysis of isolated EVs can provide additional diagnostic and pathophysiological information over plasma alone. TWEAK is a vesicle-associated protein with potential utility as a biomarker for ACR.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Olof GidlÃ¶f"", ids = ""47853239""); list(name = ""Ihdina Sukma Dewi"", ids = ""52251812""); list(name = ""Jenny Ã–hman"", ids = ""50303055""); list(name = ""Mikael Evander"", ids = ""40302760""); list(name = ""Thomas Laurell"", ids = ""3279530""); list(name = ""George J.

e71c757f71dbfc10c25b6305429c08eaf830ecec,Local False Discovery Rate Based Methods for Multiple Testing of One-Way Classified Hypotheses,"This paper continues the line of research initiated in Liu, Sarkar and Zhao (2016) on developing a novel framework for multiple testing of hypotheses grouped in a one-way classified form using hypothesis-specific local false discovery rates (Lfdr's). It is built on an extension of the standard two-class mixture model from single to multiple groups, defining hypothesis-specific Lfdr as a function of the conditional Lfdr for the hypothesis given that it is within a significant group and the Lfdr for the group itself and involving a new parameter that measures grouping effect. This definition captures the underlying group structure for the hypotheses belonging to a group more effectively than the standard two-class mixture model. Two new Lfdr based methods, possessing meaningful optimalities, are produced in their oracle forms. One, designed to control false discoveries across the entire collection of hypotheses, is proposed as a powerful alternative to simply pooling all the hypotheses into a single group and using commonly used Lfdr based method under the standard single-group two-class mixture model. The other is proposed as an Lfdr analog of the method of Benjamini and Bogomolov (2014) for selective inference. It controls Lfdr based measure of false discoveries associated with selecting groups concurrently with controlling the average of within-group false discovery proportions across the selected groups. Numerical studies show that our proposed methods are indeed more powerful than their relevant competitors, at least in their oracle forms, in commonly occurring practical scenarios.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Sanat K.

046e56d13174185f5318500961effaa8daaab9be,Microarray blob-defect removal improves array analysis,"MOTIVATION
New generation Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays often have blob-like image defects that will require investigators to either repeat their hybridization assays or analyze their data with the defects left in place. We investigated the effect of analyzing a spike-in experiment on Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays in the presence of simulated blobs covering between 1 and 9% of the array area. Using two different ChIP-chip tiling array analysis programs (Affymetrix tiling array software, TAS, and model-based analysis of tiling arrays, MAT), we found that even the smallest blob defects significantly decreased the sensitivity and increased the false discovery rate (FDR) of the spike-in target prediction.


RESULTS
We introduced a new software tool, the microarray blob remover (MBR), which allows rapid visualization, detection and removal of various blob defects from the .CEL files of different types of Affymetrix microarrays. It is shown that using MBR significantly improves the sensitivity and FDR of a tiling array analysis compared to leaving the affected probes in the analysis.

d337795cdcda7c2668e23600e9654ed96be74763,"Effects of add-on mirtazapine on neurocognition in schizophrenia: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.","Mirtazapine added to antipsychotics appears to improve the clinical picture of schizophrenia, including both negative and positive symptoms. This study explored the effect of adjunctive mirtazapine on neurocognition in patients with schizophrenia who had shown an insufficient response to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). Thirty-seven schizophrenia patients, who were at least moderately ill despite their FGA treatment, received add-on mirtazapine (n=19) or placebo (n=18) in a 6-wk double-blind, randomized trial. Widely used neuropsychological tests were performed to explore visual-spatial functions, verbal and visual memory, executive functions, verbal fluency and general mental and psychomotor speed. The data were analysed on the modified intent-to-treat basis with last observation carried forward. False discovery rate was applied to correct for multiple testing. Mirtazapine outperformed placebo in the domains of visual-spatial ability and general mental speed/attentional control as assessed by, correspondingly, Block Design and Stroop dots. The difference in the degree of change (i.e. change while on mirtazapine minus that on placebo) was 18.6% (p=0.044) and 11.1% (p=0.044), respectively. Adjunctive mirtazapine might offer a safe, effective and cost-saving option as a neurocognitive enhancer for FGA-treated schizophrenia patients. Mirtazapine+FGA combinations may become especially useful in light of the currently increasing attention towards FGAs.

991ccd62c8ad721b6d64dbc3be215f8cda060dc0,Perceived Racial Discrimination and DNA Methylation Among African American Women in the InterGEN Study,"Introduction: Experiences of racial discrimination have been associated with poor health outcomes. Little is known, however, about how perceived racial discrimination influences DNA methylation (DNAm) among African Americans (AAs). We examined the association of experiences of discrimination with DNAm among AA women in the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) study. Methods: The InterGEN study examines the effects of genetic and psychological factors on blood pressure among AA women and their children. Measures include the Major Life Discrimination (MLD) and the Race-Related Events (RES) scales. In the present analysis, we examined discrimination and DNAm at baseline in the InterGEN study. The 850K EPIC Illumina BeadChip was used for evaluating DNAm in this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Results: One hundred and fifty-two women contributed data for the RES-EWAS analysis and 147 for the MLD-EWAS analysis. Most were 30â€“39 years old, nonsmokers, had some college education, and had incomes <US$15,000/year. After controlling for age, smoking, and cell composition, MLD was significantly associated with DNAm at nine CpG (regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide) sites (false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected p < .05). For the RES-EWAS analysis, no DNAm sites passed the epigenome-wide significance level after genomic control, though suggestive associations were observed at CpG sites after genomic control (raw p < 10âˆ’5). Conclusion: We observed significant epigenetic associations between disease-associated genes (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and asthma) and perceived discrimination as measured by the MLD Scale. Future health disparities research should include epigenetics in high-risk populations to elucidate functional consequences induced by the psychosocial environment.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Veronica Barcelona de Mendoza"", ids = ""1435255302""); list(name = ""Yunfeng Huang"", ids = ""49866582""); list(name = ""Cindy A Crusto"", ids = ""5722287""); list(name = ""Yan V.

Enzymatic digestion under appropriate reducing conditions followed by mass spectrometry analysis has emerged as the primary method for disulfide bond analysis. The large amount of mass spectral data collected in the mass spectrometry experiment requires effective computational approaches to automate the interpretation process. Although different approaches have been developed for such purpose, they always choose to ignore the frequently observed internal ion fragments and they lack a reasonable quality control strategy and calibrated scoring scheme for the statistical validation and ranking of the reported results.


Results
In this research, we present a new computational approach, DISC (DISulfide bond Characterization), for matching an input MS/MS spectrum against the putative disulfide linkage structures hypothetically constructed from the protein database. More specifically, we consider different ion types including a variety of internal ions that frequently observed in mass spectra resulted from disulfide linked peptides, and introduce an effective two-layer scoring scheme to evaluate the significance of the matching between spectrum and structure, based on which we have also developed a useful target-decoy strategy for providing quality control and reporting false discovery rate in the final results. Systematic experiments conducted on both low-complexity and high-complexity datasets demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed method for the identification of disulfide bonds from MS/MS spectra, and showed its potential in characterizing disulfide bonds at the proteome scale instead of just a single protein.

In such studies, searching over hundreds of thousands of markers for the few ones that are associated with disease brings out the multiple-hypothesis testing problem in its severe form. We explore, in a two-stage design, how the use of false discovery rate (FDR) can alleviate the burden of a prohibitively strict significance level for single marker tests and still control the number of false positive findings, when there is more than one causal variant. FDR is the expected proportion of false positives among all significant findings. It can be approximated by (1-p""0)@a/[(1-p""0)@a+p""0(1-@b)], where p""0 is the proportion of true causal markers, @a is the type I error rate and 1-@b the power of a two-stage study. When 500,000 SNPs are genotyped in the first stage with fixed SNP array and the most significant SNPs are genotyped in the second stage with standard but 20 times more expensive high-throughput techniques, up to 20% savings in the minimum genotyping cost is achieved for p""0 in the range of 10^-^5 to 5x10^-^4 and FDR in the range of 0.05 to 0.7, compared to when Bonferroni-corrected significance level is used.

38b707f2175ef83f5a51533f78fb3a5da2201f71,Epigenetically dysregulated genes and pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of non-syndromic high myopia,"Myopia, commonly referred to as nearsightedness, is one of the most common causes of visual disability throughout the world. It affects more people worldwide than any other chronic visual impairment condition. Although the prevalence varies among various ethnic groups, the incidence of myopia is increasing in all populations across globe. Thus, it is considered a pressing public health problem. Both genetics and environment play a role in development of myopia. To elucidate the epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying the pathophysiology of high-myopia, we conducted methylation profiling in 18 cases and 18 matched controls (aged 4â€“12 years), using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChips array. The degree of myopia was variable among subjects, ranging from âˆ’6 to âˆ’15D. We identified 1541 hypermethylated CpGs, representing 1745 genes (2.0-fold or higher) (false discovery rate (FDR) pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.05), multiple CpGs were pâ€‰<â€‰5â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’8 with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC)â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.75 in high-myopia subjects compared to controls. Among these, 48 CpGs had excellent correlation (AUCâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.90). Herein, we present the first genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in a unique high-myopia cohort, showing extensive and discrete methylation changes relative to controls. The genes we identified hold significant potential as targets for novel therapeutic intervention either alone, or in combination.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sangeetha Vishweswaraiah"", ids = ""4090122""); list(name = ""Joanna Swierkowska"", ids = ""11557130""); list(name = ""Uppala Ratnamala"", ids = ""5257684""); list(name = ""Nitish Kumar Mishra"", ids = ""50782269""); list(name = ""Chittibabu Guda"", ids = ""48140176""); list(name = ""Shiva Shankar Chettiar"", ids = ""39995781""); list(name = ""Kaid Johar"", ids = ""48103259""); list(name = ""Malgorzata Mrugacz"", ids = ""153451212""); list(name = ""Justyna A.

6cef4582188a0f46823fac9ec0e8a7006f0d193d,"GHRH, PRP-PACAP and GHRHR Target Sequencing via an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine Reveals an Association with Growth in Orange-Spotted Grouper (Epinephelus coioides)","Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and the receptor, GHRHR, constitute important components of the hypothalamus-pituitary growth axis and act on the downstream growth hormone (GH). PACAP-related peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PRP-PACAP) is a paralog of GHRH. These genes all play key roles in development and growth patterns. To improve the quality of cultured fish strains, natural genetic variation must be examined and understood. A mixed linear model has been widely used in association mapping, taking the population structures and pairwise kinship patterns into consideration. In this study, a mass cross population of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) was examined. These candidate genes were found to harbor low nucleotide diversity (Î¸w from 0.00154 to 0.00388) and linkage disequilibrium levels (delay of 50% within 2 kbp).

b0d77b5513db0fec7c2ded884cbcc41605514dfe,Sample Size Estimation while Controlling False Discovery Rate for Microarray Experiments Using the ssize.fdr Package,"Microarray experiments are becoming more and more popular and critical in many biological disciplines. As in any statistical experiment, appropriate experimental design is essential for reliable statistical inference, and sample size has a crucial role in experimental design. Because microarray experiments are rather costly, it is important to have an adequate sample size that will achieve a desired power without wasting resources. For a given microarray data set, thousands of hypotheses, one for each gene, are simultaneously tested. Storey and Tibshirani (2003) argue that controlling false discovery rate (FDR) is more reasonable and more powerful than controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) in genomic data. However, the most common procedure used to calculate sample size involves controlling FWER, not FDR. Liu and Hwang (2007) describe a method for a quick sample size calculation for microarray experiments while controlling FDR. In this paper, we introduce the R package ssize.fdr which implements the method proposed by Liu and Hwang (2007). This package can be applied for designing one-sample, two-sample, or multi-sample experiments. The practitioner defines the desired power, the level of FDR to control, the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes, as well as effect size and variance. More specifically, the effect size and variance can be set as fixed or random quantities coming from appropriate distributions. Based on user-defined parameters, this package creates plots of power vs. sample size. These plots allow for visualization of trade-offs between power and sample size, in addition to the changes between power and sample size when the user-defined quantities are modified. For more in-depth details and evaluation of this sample size calculation method, please refer to Liu and Hwang (2007).",2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Megan Orr"", ids = ""40619223""); list(name = ""Peng Liu"", ids = ""145779137"")",220b1e483185e378fbdf5da61f05cb88bb0e219f; 17aceacffa08e607491a46f9cede72e6b5d34551; fb07fcfe37e32d8f21f04079fc088834ed28b7b1; 18a757feb1107789f02859578223f29dcbc51e2a; 7354e82d8d53ef2fe8bd904700ec95ca78599f81,e7b9bb433eb30eae9bbec7d4ae97903a6718c083; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44,R Journal,1,47-53
9ba29d6b2fef93ea5f20207b604b9faaf44d955b,Defining and Detecting Complex Peak Relationships in Mass Spectral Data: The Mz.unity Algorithm.,"Analysis of a single analyte by mass spectrometry can result in the detection of more than 100 degenerate peaks. These degenerate peaks complicate spectral interpretation and are challenging to annotate. In mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, this degeneracy leads to inflated false discovery rates, data sets containing an order of magnitude more features than analytes, and an inefficient use of resources during data analysis. Although software has been introduced to annotate spectral degeneracy, current approaches are unable to represent several important classes of peak relationships. These include heterodimers and higher complex adducts, distal fragments, relationships between peaks in different polarities, and complex adducts between features and background peaks. Here we outline sources of peak degeneracy in mass spectra that are not annotated by current approaches and introduce a software package called mz.unity to detect these relationships in accurate mass data. Using mz.unity, we find that data sets contain many more complex relationships than we anticipated. Examples include the adduct of glutamate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), fragments of NAD detected in the same or opposite polarities, and the adduct of glutamate and a background peak. Further, the complex relationships we identify show that several assumptions commonly made when interpreting mass spectral degeneracy do not hold in general. These contributions provide new tools and insight to aid in the annotation of complex spectral relationships and provide a foundation for improved data set identification.

8bb9e58a3c5efb73ab51ffcf96a2f4a04d40c2f7,Diffuse intrinsic pontine tumors: a study of primitive neuroectodermal tumors versus the more common diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.,"OBJECT
The diagnosis of diffuse pontine tumors has largely been made on the basis of MRI since the early 1990 s. In cases of tumors considered ""typical,"" as a rule, no biopsy specimen has been obtained, and the tumors have been considered diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs). There have been sporadic reports that primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) of the pons may not be distinguishable from the DIPGs by radiological imaging. This study presents 2 cases of diffuse pontine PNETs with molecular evidence that these are indeed PNETs, distinct from DIPGs, thus supporting biopsy of diffuse pontine tumors as a standard of care.


METHODS
Biopsy specimens were obtained from 7 diffuse pontine tumors and snap frozen. Two of these 7 tumors were identified on the basis of pathological examination as PNETs. All 7 of the diffuse pontine tumors were analyzed for gene expression using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip microarray. Gene expression was compared with that of supratentorial PNETs, medulloblastomas, and low- and high-grade gliomas outside the brainstem.


RESULTS
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression demonstrated that pontine PNETs are most closely related to PNETs of the supratentorial region and not with gliomas. They do not cluster with the 5 DIPGs in the study. Thirty-eight genes, including GATA3, are uniquely differentially expressed in pontine PNETs compared with other types of pediatric brain tumors, including DIPGs and other PNETs at a false discovery rate statistical significance of less than 0.05.


CONCLUSIONS
The cluster and individual gene expression analyses indicate that pontine PNETs are intrinsically different from DIPGs. The 2 pontine PNET cases cluster with supratentorial PNETs, rather than with DIPGs, suggesting that these tumors should be treated with a PNET regimen, not with DIPG therapy. Since diagnosis by imaging is not reliable and the biology of the tumors is disparate, a biopsy should be performed to enable accurate diagnosis and direct potentially more effective treatments.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alexandra J D Sufit"", ids = ""6891658""); list(name = ""Andrew M.

8f968be5da92f08d77ab4cd96ac1b7cd0f87a8c3,Disrupted Functional Connectivity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Cirrhotic Patients without Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy: A Resting State fMRI Study,"BACKGROUND
To evaluate the changes of functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with cirrhosis without overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) using resting state functional MRI.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Participants included 67 cirrhotic patients (27 minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) and 40 cirrhotic patients without MHE (non-HE)), and 40 age- and gender- matched healthy controls. rsfMRI were performed on 3 Telsa scanners. The pregenual ACC resting-state networks (RSNs) were characterized by using a standard seed-based whole-brain correlation method and compared between cirrhotic patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the ACC RSNs and venous blood ammonia levels, neuropsychological tests (number connection test type A [NCT-A] and digit symbol test [DST]) scores in cirrhotic patients. All thresholds were set at P<0.05, with false discovery rate corrected. Compared with controls, non-HE and MHE patients showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the bilateral ACC, bilateral middle frontal cortex (MFC), bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG)/middle temporal gyri (MTG), bilateral thalami, bilateral putamen and bilateral insula, and increased functional connectivity of bilateral precuneus and left temporo-occipital lobe and bilateral lingual gyri. Compared with non-HE patients, MHE showed the decreased functional connectivity of right MCC, bilateral STG/MTG and right putamen. This indicates decreased ACC functional connectivity predominated with the increasing severity of HE. NCT-A scores negatively correlated with ACC functional connectivity in the bilateral MCC, right temporal lobe, and DST scores positively correlated with functional connectivity in the bilateral ACC and the right putamen.

785ae9d912ba1d19f6989df05c6e406214534dfb,Variable selection for high dimensional Gaussian copula regression model: An adaptive hypothesis testing procedure,"In this paper we consider the variable selection problem for high dimensional Gaussian copula regression model. We transform the variable selection problem into a multiple testing problem. Compared to the existing methods depending on regularization or a stepwise algorithm, our method avoids the ambiguous relationship between the regularized parameter and the number of false discovered variables or the decision of a stopping rule. We exploit nonparametric rank-based correlation coefficient estimators to construct our test statistics which achieve robustness and adaptivity to the unknown monotone marginal transformations. We show that our multiple testing procedure can control the false discovery rate (FDR) or the average number of falsely discovered variables (FDV) asymptotically. We also propose a screening multiple testing procedure to deal with the extremely high dimensional setting. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conduct numerical simulations to compare the variable selection performance of our method with some state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method is also applied on a communities and crime unnormalized data set to illustrate its empirical usefulness.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yong He"", ids = ""145475635""); list(name = ""Xinsheng Zhang"", ids = ""8443337""); list(name = ""Liwen Zhang"", ids = ""3854880"")",f0c023dface685f8a561ea48237fa1a84355c76b; cdb20d7c9b9d6197d124e6ef67526c303c3f308c; 1ffa02dfc0ffcba9667dfb343da6d2bf4700dc24,,Comput.

996f78a1967139e6ea2d97d4dfe613b17394f227,Association between microRNA machinery gene polymorphisms and recurrent implantation failure,"The present study aimed to investigate the potential association of five miRNA machinery gene polymorphisms (DICER1 rs3742330A>G, DROSHA rs10719T>C, RAN rs14035C>T, XPO5 rs11077A>C and DGCR8 rs417309G>A) with recurrent implantation failure (RIF), a clinical condition in which good-quality embryos repeatedly fail to implant following two or more in vitro fertilization cycles, and its associated risk factors in Korean women. Therefore, the present study performed genotype analysis and assessed the frequency of these miRNA gene polymorphisms in patients diagnosed with RIF (n=119) and randomly selected controls (n=210) with at least one live birth and no history of pregnancy loss. The DROSHA rs10719T>C and RAN rs14035C>T polymorphisms were identified to be significantly associated with decreased prevalence of RIF. Additionally, the DROSHA rs10719 TC and the RAN rs14035 CT genotypes were present at significantly lower frequencies in the RIF group than in the control group (adjusted odds ratio=0.550; 95% CI, 0.339-0.893; P=0.016; and adjusted odds ratio=0.590; 95% CI, 0.363-0.958; P=0.033, respectively). Furthermore, the combined RAN rs14035 CT+TT genotype was observed to be associated with decreased RIF prevalence (adjusted odds ratio=0.616; 95% CI, 0.386-0.982; P=0.042). Genotype combination analysis for the various miRNA polymorphisms revealed that the DROSHA TC genotype exhibited a highly significant negative association with RIF prevalence when combined with the RAN CT genotype (adjusted odds ratio=0.314; 95% CI, 0.147-0.673; P=0.003; false discovery rate-adjusted P=0.023). The present study revealed an association between the DROSHA rs10719 and RAN rs14035 3'UTR polymorphisms and decreased risk of RIF in Korean women, which suggests that these gene polymorphisms could represent potential markers for predicting RIF risk.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Yubin Lee"", ids = ""5957573""); list(name = ""Eun Hee Ahn"", ids = ""16197272""); list(name = ""Chang Soo Ryu"", ids = ""14425504""); list(name = ""Jung Oh Kim"", ids = ""21510805""); list(name = ""Hui Jeong An"", ids = ""66854514""); list(name = ""Sung Hwan Cho"", ids = ""49467417""); list(name = ""Ji Hyang Kim"", ids = ""40570332""); list(name = ""Young Ran Kim"", ids = ""66821398""); list(name = ""Woo Sik Lee"", ids = ""8097089""); list(name = ""Nam Keun Kim"", ids = ""52641885"")",,8f798497dddc7e5ab96fad2a8ff18819b5d35376; c280edf00ae01252da17ab058d010306e25771f8; 26501f44107d3fd7545f3a328ba1f398177ed680; 6830e0ec556808b53e530e3707cd3e414588055d; 235fde70ad88e60a65d2d0a6f645d828fcf333be; 14634fea8684820b718d2aa3eddd3af056ecda57; bcdca2183afc50bfdc3d88f22c4f2a70cfd8d370; b79c92e6c23b0ee585d67a1cdb4e0e308efdde14; a433bb0807bc6698ac84c89b01b99ca6d634fcea; 402cb73b08c25273a23f739543762e43ce25d162; aac0b87d85b30a9767f924414f408e32aab662b8; 98866d2d33de58424e8d5057dbdcd5b9d2e2d1ee; 0febdc607f791555296d08f9e25165c702d5a6bb; 899fa94a03fcdf9bd775ff887acdff66790bd43c; 4ecfccd889c6b0f349e0f2d5cc8e3424a0bdebd0; 4588cc4f2a0a6449fe0f703842dcdf1edf74f1e0; aa847abba882e62696233d66c4039da7fce9052f; 228c676dd0f53e68f940e7ac01197156959a4863; 9cc800c61dcef2301f9705cf8d35db5d97e69d2a; 14d34db8ccaa67a445d658c1e15879aeaaaa7165; 5f5293eca7543acd865e578866edf47040af6f9b; fcd9a746ab35968306b19c65bad3aafda4bb7411; 721268ea924df18f5a262d1974479f00623f6370; 1ba6b703dc6fe55df8a25b11580715574b4c4cd1; 19b01e472297203371395eabf4d5c1337e5397f0; 97ce5dd132a768266c4fa63ff90d30e038722fbe; bbdcd399af18493927babeab4388d618d1117d90; 5219642c1394da3e61cb8bf2bd411c0a843ec4fe; dc55fd791468ee90cc50904f75a4948e5acc6424; 2d2bc520f6ba3ee6d63b29f1da34eafe6bf05ab6; 1e27c9d81883123d9e9599be42c959cead03ba17; 18770923b95dbd9033c7f3d69f362f28faa51ee0; 39e02e9364446e0ca84ae5d932afee64f616ca74; cf19142bd26fb98a83b00618791c3b2f29bb3ac1; 626e9e9fa42b32047622b39bde514dd3456b3277; 1c7efac8d8a916f794dded4083f5bb315340e0d0; 38489c87864bee7556deda1be07c2ce9d990bc1d; 5c124516a2f8958205feb942488baf157be978ab; 101e462b5e4079289c4954875d565cd02e6bec5b; ed6e89998929575e20d1c9a8c59dd161ff0e8447; 5016ad8db53844c30e09309acdd9ca104ee87ec3; 49a65e2cecd786edb9cf42b27c393415e6f0c272; 66c083c71d44746de7acf3b473d3c193c6209557; 884511d417096edbb4956aa938c3476a90c328ab; 9dc80ad2303f7910c21c62818ee7cfb6512c0efe; 90210386fbe1ad0b0f8ef738bbcf0e792454e8fe; 1443c8ddf7fe2fbaeec1a5c71f025a290f9aa84c; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; f43317fbe95c40abdbecd87720f31c5c37ffef5e,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,19,3113 - 3123
295e445b3f288b7820895e0a9f9d2fc9fa909dcb,A fully Bayesian hidden Ising model for ChIP-seq data analysis.,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful technique that is being used in a wide range of biological studies including genome-wide measurements of protein-DNA interactions, DNA methylation, and histone modifications. The vast amount of data and biases introduced by sequencing and/or genome mapping pose new challenges and call for effective methods and fast computer programs for statistical analysis. To systematically model ChIP-seq data, we build a dynamic signal profile for each chromosome and then model the profile using a fully Bayesian hidden Ising model. The proposed model naturally takes into account spatial dependency and global and local distributions of sequence tags. It can be used for one-sample and two-sample analyses. Through model diagnosis, the proposed method can detect falsely enriched regions caused by sequencing and/or mapping errors, which is usually not offered by the existing hypothesis-testing-based methods. The proposed method is illustrated using 3 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data sets and 2 mixed ChIP-seq data sets and compared with 4 popular and/or well-documented methods: MACS, CisGenome, BayesPeak, and SISSRs. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves equivalent or higher sensitivity and spatial resolution in detecting TF binding sites with false discovery rate at a much lower level.",2012,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Qianxing Mo"", ids = ""50453243"")",a6f98b8ca92c5889d0c73c0ac328929b578b5154; c786ea3234cac997d1e8e180890afe259863c260; a4d2c35269473d548593c03037f3cba634dff0dd; 67e58ef2da3d1b202989b7c40b074c0df377dd64; e31d807c1c4465cfe13d6bf47b507bb1bb9bb284; 53c2a2f1a2738f18dc4527d3c4497e5df4499ee9; 992a40a1fc33a6ba60283506a183de3d16fd17b0; 5da4294a9e08ba800c7005de992c31f9fab296b5; 5044635c778a4a3c8f1cf523157a08611dd72f4e; 6714afed9c76b17dc4f30e1dcaadd5a7fd98d8af; 19584b81ee654743db53e0448f8cdd6c3976564d; 3142418c2c58cdbb072615d9e021bb33f2c3c715; 3f5f5319c96bdf97e5b0e39694d25752730bd98c; 1e50657c10c75dbf6a96e99e2c828d6427a6c802; 3a03777aca0d159f2fcb8bc72c020480b6b495cc; 7f4ba62e758b08786cf3d1ffe81e92e2108b6054,e38425de9c943ae6e52f9e2f244378214082710e; 86b241a5d041a74ba9eaa13ce14400f476130c9c; 1e2ac9587c9a57a49583990602142c84b3f19625; 842204e75e5b04df1b056c62f0c390cea314f13b; c5d15702ed2bed2160e668ce5197c1005db8ca70; 42abddd227d653a0375d7d037ddb885f6c07f66f; bb478fc83df4331b8603de59a50085946cf941c1; 1a01e2de435091cb169cb55313663cdb07689c8d; d96a65ec8a8e5f7297a72a4de5977729e9fff274; ad07a438761a4ec34dfa78191f94dedd60d714af; 5169f2bb6486e983fe7a2679467817b0fea4a8c3; a041be5af6fd2301a029c2d2d5223f4c9385c47b; a24b890fb3863998a8376630375e5325e669b291; 0a9a7a07ed45cbebe103affca52df5b7c5a0b4df; 68a416e11fec1760d4c4cd19478fb63cd04a9d3f; c47b3d755cf4aa3bae8e6b092ec6459e202d8845; 3cf0ae41c9be3bd615ef2b7156132ff104daa803; b3315db892f5e0c0b355ca2257438b186c3788a7; 9508f84faddb683c89adb40285b0d822abec734f; 107db2432fbb2e94eb8351c9659056c03d3cea84; aef6fb15684330ae063f86c212635fb00e8b029b; 6a859c968152caced9498a82067ec223c682e4fe; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 9c6bf5157ad2fb538089de9fc9c3c453025d4d17; e588cdc331bce50851cccd843e57d70afb2e2aec,Biostatistics,13 1,"

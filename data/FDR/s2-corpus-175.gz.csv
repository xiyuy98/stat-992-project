Unfortunately, they are recorded only sparsely in OpenStreetMap. This leads to non-optimal routes. To counteract this problem, the topic of this project is to automate the process of finding crosswalks on orthophotos (satellite images). The result is an application which finds yellow crosswalks along streets and extracts their coordinates. The recognition is implemented with a neural network. It has achieved a recognition rate of over 80 % with a false discovery rate of less than 10 %. This process could be shared on a large number of computer by using a queuing system that makes the processing of so much data possible. After that, the coordinates were added to the crowdsourcing system MapRoulette. With this solution the coordinates of the crosswalks can be integrated in OpenStreetMap to help improve pedestrian navigation. It is possible to expand this solution so that the algorithm can be applied to other objects.",2016,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Stefan Keller"", ids = ""144529668""); list(name = ""Severin BÃ¼hler"", ids = ""20909691""); list(name = ""Samuel Kurath"", ids = ""39905837"")",97385707288fa1f117f0c09fcf797cce9d9d9bef; ff013401b00b1826d5a537e6de563d72e2b2abc6,,AGIT Journal,2,162-166

Hence, targeting BSCs will be crucial to achieve successful treatment of breast cancer. Methods: We characterized mammospheres derived from more than 40 cancer patients and two breast cancer cell lines for the expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) and stem cell markers. Mammosphere formation and proliferation assays were performed on cells from 19 cancer patients and five healthy individuals after incubation with ER-subtype selective ligands. Transcriptional analysis was performed to identify pathways activated in ERb-stimulated mammospheres and verified using in vitro experiments. Xenograft models (n1â„44 or 5 per group) were used to study the role of ERs during tumorigenesis. Results: We identified an absence of ERa but upregulation of ERb in BSCs associated with phenotypic stem cell markers and responsible for the proliferative role of estrogens. Knockdown of ERb caused a reduction of mammosphere formation in cell lines and in patient-derived cancer cells (40.7%, 26.8%, and 39.1%, respectively). Gene set enrichment analysis identified glycolysis-related pathways (false discovery rate < 0.001) upregulated in ERb-activated mammospheres. We observed that tamoxifen or fulvestrant alone was insufficient to block proliferation of patient-derived BSCs while this could be accomplished by a selective inhibitor of ERb (PHTPP; 53.7% in luminal and 45.5% in triple-negative breast cancers). Furthermore, PHTPP reduced tumor initiation in two patient-derived xenografts (75.9% and 59.1% reduction in tumor volume, respectively) and potentiated tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of tumor growth in MCF7 xenografts. Conclusion: We identify ERb as a mediator of estrogen action in BSCs and a novel target for endocrine therapy.Background: Breast cancer cells with tumor-initiating capabilities (BSCs) are considered to maintain tumor growth and govern metastasis.

Conclusion: We identify ERb as a mediator of estrogen action in BSCs and a novel target for endocrine therapy. The existence of breast cancer cells with stem cellâ€“like capacity has been suggested as a likely explanation to therapeutic resistance and tumor relapse (1). Serial passaging of cells growing as nonadherent spheres can be applied to isolate and propagate both normal mammary stem cells (MSCs) and breast cancer stem cells (BSCs) (1,2). BSCs are highly tumorigenic in mouse transplantation assays compared with differentiated cancer cells (3). In addition, the majority of mammospheres are phenotypically CD24(-), CD44(Ã¾), EpCAM(Ã¾) (3,4), and/or with high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) (5,6). Approximately 75% of all breast cancers are positive for estrogen receptor (ER)a (ESR1), which in turn positively correlates with response to endocrine therapy (7). The second estrogen receptor, ERb (ESR2), has in some studies been associated with improved survival in tamoxifen-treated patients (8â€“10). The two ER subtypes are encoded by genes on different chromosomes A R T IC LE Received: October 16, 2014; Revised: August 15, 2016; Accepted: September 20, 2016 Â© The Author 2017.

Large-scale collection of data inevitably generates batch effects introduced by differences in processing at various stages from sample collection to data generation. However, batch effects on the sequence variation and its characteristics have not been studied extensively.ResultsWe systematically evaluated batch effects on somatic sequence variations in pan-cancer TCGA data, revealing 999 somatic variants that were batch-biased with statistical significance (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.00001, Fisherâ€™s exact test, false discovery rateâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.0027). Most of the batch-biased variants were associated with specific sample plates. The batch-biased variants, which had a unique mutational spectrum with frequent indel-type mutations, preferentially occurred at sites prone to sequencing errors, e.g., in long homopolymer runs. Non-indel type batch-biased variants were frequent at splicing sites with the unique consensus motif sequence â€˜TTDTTTAGTTâ€™. Furthermore, some batch-biased variants occur in known cancer genes, potentially causing misinterpretation of mutation profiles.ConclusionsOur strategy for identifying batch-biased variants and characterising sequence patterns might be useful in eliminating false variants and facilitating correct interpretation of sequence profiles.",2017,Medicine; Biology; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Ji-Hye Choi"", ids = ""7629356""); list(name = ""Seong-Eui Hong"", ids = ""2242185""); list(name = ""Hyun Goo Woo"", ids = ""2509645"")",c7613800ae1591956e6a98a27c4f5a6adaedbbfb; b2ea948aa720770e81bf246e06e7aff3aa5c1f15; 180ae09a472567d6762fbda35f215fae6b9781ad,597900ff24e520410afc02aac63f51913e55e696; cf4ac8c588c71fd30892a6b5125dfc13a263dfb9; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; 47c1e79e4fc24a852390ceb3fb068f2a62718714; f942cf8a040a874468b84d42b1aa73cec48fe02f; 9933ad02813e53ddae7fba57075b4bf14c629a51; 177ed6696d1a61bb80851df5c8d39e61bf7f4feb; 1069287cec7f8226a4233c5314522bf727e568d4; 40e4e0d2825bf6806bb1b9cb0f7cbe97c1f6d028; 9f68cb5f9e948d2a1b2793dfb2d81d68c31f3171; 6d7fc69b2668ba7e9ed09797615da6e4cee0fcd1; 2dcc572a055f64b1831322e1d60fa291e509aeba; 42328a2214c0d04973945d65d2f33e95e432a6ee; 7735c5ab018914107b4b1933de5cfe5506352073; 5498feb293c98371d47bea089938ba547983b79a; e699637bfdce44ebf065d68b1013aa14e9a0ddff; 66d4dd24c454fd7b11f1091b9efc40db954700be; d276a59508031a52115720666e278ad40231c598; e6d14bc16ed66252e91aa2a42d8f7aa8ebfd8575; 52125dd0e436a5fe3ced11587aa4f37a01c51a87; 59bde7b3624469ed5913f6026b9c1a81985fe81d; 912ae5c7ed92e1ce4047bdbb82927767d5721b21; d4e03748a7d206ccd02f01a19e6e11120902baa6; 0411079e9c554ae07970b640b4a0371f21c7beec; d56e8ed33f7c7a5ccc2c3b3d098a8094c6712bd0; 20890c1de288f645f6b7b3cdee90304b5dce6831; 6e00f7980c4efc55ba76efdccebc6411f054a7da; 0446839238dc22746e99eb746ce11bc7e18f33b1; d7b02543a0536923fcd660217c6d7f821adcd30d; 8cf39bd0e7c348eb07650f59e2d7869fc75a6713; 8c77c718563b5e823feac3a4e0b843c75457f5fd,BMC Bioinformatics,18,

The FDR is the expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP), that is, the expected fraction of false rejections among all rejected hypotheses. A number of refinements to the original Benjamini-Hochberg procedure have been proposed, to increase power by estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses, either implicitly, leading to one-stage adaptive procedures or explicitly, leading to two-stage adaptive (or plug-in) procedures. We use a variant of the stochastic process approach proposed by Genovese and Wasserman to study the fluctuations of the FDP achieved with each of these procedures around its expectation, for independent tested hypotheses. We introduce a framework for the derivation of generic Central Limit Theorems for the FDP of these procedures, characterizing the associated regularity conditions, and comparing the asymptotic power of the various procedures. We interpret recently proposed one-stage adaptive procedures as fixed points in the iteration of well known two-stage adaptive procedures.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Pierre Neuvial"", ids = ""2225429"")",34382262d4407dbf2781acd514965b22c9350237; 4d442f793573153f93e2901617b97ca90098be5a; 4c850f993f637e55275c902ae43cf6019592016a; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; 275a6c6ee2badd48096441e3174f9ed86926dee7; 37f6545085e7dcddf483728d17113013a86a3165; b1a2c9e94f92006d9df6874e5dc26669dcde4930; ff78265a35edeb990632663c53ff8cc506ecdca9; 60f9c181ff8e25e80b5b30df8823014d843b7322; fd4de5e69b3942e3ff28ed06f1722b0e17d5fadf; e6fbec5d97a9b9ec3b04f72079387352752cbab5; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 9b7944d85138c4b6a31f667a6f1c585b8e97cf7c,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; d60004fb5fe01f2ae4aacbb5f3839ed97d307661; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 7c8ab4825e0d59ab38c0790a8ca7ee81edfe9e4b; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; fa8216104648f5e7d4379f85bfd9ebbd8ce45710; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 72bda2b9be1e4bac9341ce5cc326c3235f9794e4; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0; 08d23fdaeec2a46da5189cf105de238fb37bb77e; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643,Electronic Journal of Statistics,2,1065-1110

We hypothesized that a comparison between Val/Val and Val/Met individuals, which may represent the most different combinations concerning the effects of the COMT genotype, may reveal new findings. We investigated the brain morphology using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging in 27 Val/Val and 22 Val/Met individuals. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that the volumes of the bilateral caudate and posterior cingulate cortex were significantly smaller in Val/Val individuals than in Val/Met individuals [right caudate: false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p = 0.048; left caudate: FDR-corrected p = 0.048; and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex: FDR-corrected p = 0.048].

4f906bfe6b28535b1d5bac2ac525bfabcf2d9369,On control of the false discovery rate under no assumption of dependency,"Abstract Most false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures require certain assumptions on the joint distribution of p-values. Benjamini and Hochberg [1995. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57, 289â€“300] proposed a step-up procedure with critical constants Î± i = ( i / m ) Î± , 1 â©½ i â©½ m , for a given level 0 Î± 1 and showed that FDR â©½ ( m 0 / m ) Î± under the assumption of independence of p-values, where m is the total number of null hypotheses and m 0 the number of true null hypotheses. Benjamini and Yekutieli [2001. The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency. Ann. Statist. 29, 1165â€“1188] showed that for the same procedure FDR â©½ ( m 0 / m ) Î± âˆ‘ j = 1 m 1 / j , whatever may be the joint distribution of p-values. In one of the results in this paper, we show that this upper bound for FDR cannot be improved in the sense that there exists a joint distribution of p-values for which the upper bound is attained. A major thrust of this paper is to work in the realm of step-down procedures without imposing any condition on the joint distribution of the underlying p-values. As a starting point, we give an explicit expression for FDR specially tailored for step-down procedures. Using the same critical constants as those of the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure, we present a new step-down procedure for which the upper bound for FDR is much lower than what is given by Benjamini and Yekutieli. The explicit expression given for FDR and some optimization techniques stemming from the knapsack problem are instrumental in getting the main result. We also present some general results on stepwise procedures built on non-decreasing sequences of critical constants.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Wenge Guo"", ids = ""47032935""); list(name = ""M.

The amygdala has been known to play a pivotal role in mediating fear-related responses including panic attacks. Given the functionally distinct role of the amygdalar subregions, morphometric measurements of the amygdala may point to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying panic disorder. The current study aimed to determine the global and local morphometric alterations of the amygdala related to panic disorder.


METHODS
Volumetric and surface-based morphometric approach to high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted images was used to examine the structural variations of the amygdala, with respect to extent and location, in 23 patients with panic disorder and 31 matched healthy individuals.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences in bilateral amygdalar volumes between patients with panic disorder and healthy individuals despite a trend-level right amygdalar volume reduction related to panic disorder (right, Î² = -0.23, p = 0.09, Cohen's d = 0.51; left, Î² = -0.18, p = 0.19, Cohen's d = 0.45). Amygdalar subregions were localized into three groups including the superficial, centromedial, and laterobasal groups based on the cytoarchitectonically defined probability map. Surface-based morphometric analysis revealed shape alterations in the laterobasal and centromedial groups of the right amygdala in patients with panic disorder (false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The current findings suggest that subregion-specific shape alterations in the right amygdala may be involved in the development and maintenance of panic disorder, which may be attributed to the cause or effects of amygdalar hyperactivation.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sujung Yoon"", ids = ""6138221""); list(name = ""Jieun E.

9301e540ce47f7f84625d45157662606eac64463,Assessment of melanoma candidate genes in a meta-analysis of 16Â 534 melanoma cases.,"BACKGROUND
Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been implicated with cutaneous melanoma (CM) Objective: The aim of our study was to establish novel susceptibility loci for CM by assessing candidate genes in a published meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies (GWASs).


METHODS
760 variants were retrieved from the MelGene database and tested for association in a meta-analysis of 11 GWASs consisting of 12,874 CM cases and 23,303 controls of European ancestry. We calculated a false discovery rate and variants that surpassed this p-value threshold were genotyped in three independent replication samples from UK, Greece and Cyprus. We excluded variants robustly associated with CM or in linkage disequilibrium with already known loci. The results from the GWASs and replication stages were synthesized in a meta-analysis.


RESULTS
Based on our approach, the rs909253 polymorphism in the LTA gene (Lymphotoxin Alpha) was followed up for further consideration. The meta-analysis of the 11 GWAS indicated a protective effect for the G allele on the risk of CM (OR: 0.921, p-value: 2.7x10-5). However, the estimates from the three replication samples were not statistically significant. The combined meta-analysis of 3,660 CM cases and 350,915 cancer-free controls provided a similar OR (0.935, p-value: 1.95x10-5); very large studies in the future will be required to determine if this SNP is a genuine melanoma risk SNP.


CONCLUSION
By assessing over 16,000 CM cases, none of the published candidate genes tested for association with CM were significant in our study. Interest should be shifted to larger GWAS.

0ab109ad38c10791e1c787d87a295d2c737e9b15,Single nucleotide polymorphisms in a cellulose synthase gene (PtoCesA3) are associated with growth and wood properties in Populus tomentosa,"In plants, the composition and organization of the cell wall determine cell shape, enable cell expansion, and affect the properties of woody tissues. Cellulose synthase (CesA) genes encode the enzymes involved in the synthesis of cellulose which is the major component of plant primary and secondary cell walls. Here, we isolated a full-length PtoCesA3 cDNA from the stem cambium tissue of Populus tomentosa. Tissue-specific expression profiling showed that PtoCesA3 is highly expressed during primary cell wall formation. Estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) revealed that PtoCesA3 harbors high SNP diversity (Ï€TÂ =Â 0.00995 and Î¸wÂ =Â 0.0102) and low LD (r2Â â‰¥Â 0.1, within 1,280Â bp). Association analysis in a P. tomentosa association population (460 individuals) showed that seven SNPs (false discovery rate QÂ <Â 0.10) and five haplotypes (QÂ <Â 0.10) were significantly associated with growth and wood properties, explaining 4.09â€“7.02Â % of the phenotypic variance. All significant marker-trait associations were validated in at least one of the three smaller subsets (climatic regions) while five associations were repeated in the linkage population. Variation in RNA transcript abundance among genotypic classes of significant loci was also confirmed in the association or linkage populations. Identification of PtoCesA3 and examining its allelic polymorphisms using association studies open an avenue to understand the mechanism of cellulose synthesis in the primary cell wall and its effects on the properties of woody tissues.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Baohua Xu"", ids = ""32782513""); list(name = ""Jiaxing Tian"", ids = ""4058615""); list(name = ""Qingzhang Du"", ids = ""3873809""); list(name = ""Chenrui Gong"", ids = ""6065519""); list(name = ""Wei Pan"", ids = ""1684285""); list(name = ""Deqiang Zhang"", ids = ""39687013"")",2bd25f8fe79aedb8a37952fda7042262e915f94f; af5626ed652140f1f9516448cfe09470bee719a7; a2f412ac34cc7f87ff8d7ad2a61ca63a5e9019e6; e47d7704b26456c93de7341f898faf479d385303; cb42e5a5c01e8876184103d140d3cf862c596294,1fdd920a49c2a133d4b363abe0c881e9f832648c; 454e448ac04163a8b579bfdd3f3d556894670503; a3e4ff813ed58e1324e3754ad80951bc773dc047; dd6c57873fd9de18d4c29983d25b26fc35d18257; 9f41595617a434584c88706ace719a378b2165c6; 16ac4d1af24a6174b0a5e1b6491424291d2973bb; 68e9351ab946fdbeae78d681bde8bdfeb5e5f91f; 2447df8c5484caeac3799e313cc71d76b0253a9c; 7600d07e4e3412b1d9c84f680424de1f17536f0d; c700eee5f49366deed6d15f625083709cd323485; 2913b69b23c59c8ff22013a98f314fe5c1ab6aca; 5c1eb2e3a6cf922c7d45ea3be89af41ec20b9f31; 8d47f3c969307ca60d75f5436ef73ca653594281; 42b3781fa9a899cecd9141a4827f2f3372a1172d; f5f95d9c4b60e1aabee718991e1e9ac9de826bf6; 511e19d0ecd87fcc758b7bc94da4f514feccc4b5; 0e96db284b96fd3bb92d8dcb099e27295c59314b; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; 92c15c860c4fd1248d720d676cbb04e6fb3fc718; e45b5618cd006ae07125767d446933e4d91cb361; 6d8f77f411e03633c55628fce61313c559adaf92; 0a417a5b09afa0eda0d037559b5ec8cee1d17e30; 8d31b951182c2efb78fc5083b46539bb099132f9; 32d16c5e91d566a36ebf60db2a075e4e6b2cd7e9; 50f7854c3715a43d16f3a43ad9d4f229fd84e4f5; a9637ff0ca090b4f8e93874e3ddffe87e0c4f2b7; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; f6330a74606f2e3ce47099e8bd8a7d489b6da170; d38266031970dcb8a336ec4c6f095bd01e1a2d16; 0a148bdd2b87f5363cdad3273c5954ea6124b27b; cd775ccaecec36f4b78ced94430bbf008e7d9d05; b4c69cf34916b2495c57e0d2e316edbcc11824ed; bab49438d46d14bf37822f83ccfc6ba11f314589; 1417b979e2dfe4e1c8cd2df724d296450f26f99f; d745f239021ce1ff976eb9bfe0e5b788c12304c6; 88e340199753a8e3cf85e5bb041d22a764e0dd1c; 55dad789bb27ec8d7c9e9f7d4e6a8759e139e51d; a099324b0962edd5b94c889a4bf99a7afae2f33b; 8dd30b9f2c3de72c1a01d825dcbd2b9fa6a8cefa; 73a35991269620b1a841d86c7694a37b35052657; 7cbc6e2fef6241580fbeb71921320b091222ddf6; c2b37d432a746509ec4692d0445a4cf3c9edf357; 349146390712ecb0d72e79bab8c43ae8c5a9b489; 0ae262d9cf78536754bc064e07113ab5e978f208; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; a3e78cb0f690dc3c81873dc57db872ca6eaeee37; bd4723eb5daffd24a6513a4762b690106939464b; fedf118ee43f5a19e95d0cf8eaf6a86137ace9fb; 06d49b0c74ebacde13bacabe9714b4825ea11ef4; 89e8793e96cd40f88383dc49320b478a0698b07c; b2289179b858aca48a3916ed086e1d5f3e23c406; 665a1ff35896765333eeffc975272fa34f5548b8; af2d72c78ecb68e6c58fe2dae9e1e6d32644dc56; b9d5f35026acb2318aaea98366aeeafc193bfd22; f96ca97840c6a06466e45ce254c397265a86fe7c; c8b7cd9c63ada4ed3b3dab9238b190c7fa3245ce; bf5b69eea008406a38f7468943ebdae3105cd998; 336861147c14c5218e6203494406cbf43dcd0e1d; 6b47cc6abb9994eb8f3e147ff52e83c4f958c8e8; d739e1f0ed1a872bc787f455c3509305f3ed60c3; 871263cb12e3f356aee13e598454e4e147a966dd; 5bed8f13e9eafd14b8a8a8e3eadbd6e033688349; cc72e0d6ebe20193d920a1262474d2a259a31d70; 16a9cafbf57e3016a550e1f2f268c7680a2cd062; 031438351827b3aa435a9a269256debdbd6b0de2; 847eab3db971b86aa434f2a60ffeef7317be5d42; afea1437d887cd996944fce49c8fd760958c5321; ed556d0f4325688abd8fddd418454770dddd38d0; da0f3762c138f3108a2d92552ee31df8effae67e; c5ef5f7782418ba4b9d7ca19b47252614bf61674; 7ace672b24f97b6ea4dbef88f907fa36bfe19640; e90ffc6e5f4ac9a0c7ee6e4f14d4682e98955c6f; 0f8619675a020010a825c56c9b902616b23d2b02; cd6b09d8ebb56d022d4d4083ebeecb46fea8baad; a51015995e5ce5deed823985a9691d92bf1e27f0; 5b364686c89e4393dadc06881661a25965038b8f; 3dc2e29682c53e161f09003967e3ec565a361ace; e02019ed5de02789318909f98542fcd42e0f5f9b; b4f17116b08dd36118096a881e7a08ce7aabe81f; 4c1899644a6f3f4d0efb1e6b5fd1b59f4d67aeb2; f7d8b975fb03a2cdb2218c05a82a2b9f504065e3; 1d85191f9a268bb7a3d6e00197fd8e50fb1e9870,Planta,240,1269-1286
5bb2c0b726c025a735b56bde3f39121f6c95edfa,Association of 77 polymorphisms in 52 candidate genes with blood pressure progression and incident hypertension: the Women's Genome Health Study.,"OBJECTIVE
Genetic risk factors for essential hypertension are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of 77 previously characterized gene variants in 52 candidate genes from various biological pathways with blood pressure (BP) progression and incident hypertension.


METHODS
We analyzed data from 18 738 white women who participated in a prospective cohort study and were free of hypertension at baseline. BP progression at 48 months and incident hypertension during the entire follow-up according to the different genotypes were assessed by logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards models, respectively.


RESULTS
At 48 months of follow-up, 7889 of 16 635 women (47.4%) had BP progression. Only three of 70 polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency of at least 2% had a significant association with BP progression. The odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133 (minor allele T), natriuretic peptide precursor A (NPPA) rs5063 (minor allele A) and NPPA rs5065 (minor allele C) were 1.05 (1.00-1.10), 0.84 (0.76-0.94) and 0.93 (0.88-1.00), respectively. After adjustment for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, only the NPPA rs5063 association remained significant. During a median follow-up of 9.8 years, 5540 of 18 738 women developed incident hypertension. Only five of 70 polymorphisms were significantly associated with incident hypertension. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for interleukin 6 (IL-6) rs1800795 (minor allele C), MTHFR rs1801133, NPPA rs5063, nitric oxide synthase 3 rs1799983 (minor allele T) and transforming growth factor, beta 1 rs1800469 (minor allele T) were 0.96 (0.92-1.00), 1.06 (1.02-1.10), 0.88 (0.80-0.96), 1.05 (1.01-1.09) and 1.05 (1.01-1.10), respectively. After adjustment for multiple testing, none of these associations remained significant.


CONCLUSION
NPPA gene polymorphisms may have a role in BP progression and incident hypertension. Our data also provide moderate confirmatory evidence of association between MTHFR rs1801133 and the development of hypertension.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""David Conen"", ids = ""47288843""); list(name = ""Suzanne Cheng"", ids = ""4617430""); list(name = ""Lori L.

071a25efc989f31ae41ff05d8cbfc4f196a92038,Dna Replication Stress by the Loss of Male Specific Histone Demethylase â€˜kdm5dâ€™ in Aggressive Prostate Cancer: Mp29â€01,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: We previously demonstrated that loss of male specific histone demethylase 0KDM5D0 is associated with docetaxel resistance (Komura et al, 2016, PNAS). Decreased KDM5D expression seemed to be attributed to the deletion of copy number loss at Yq11 in prostate cancer. METHODS: RNAseq and ChIPseq were performed to elucidate the biological function of KDM5D using hormone sensitive LNCaP cells (KDM5D positive) and corresponding LNCaP-104R2 CRPC cells (KDM5D negative by copy number loss of Y chromosome). Clinical impact of the genes regulated by KDM5D were further examined in TCGA and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (PHS/HPFS) cohorts. RESULTS: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) from the data of RNAseq in LNCaP (control vs sh-KDM5D#1 and #3) and LNCaP-104R2 (control vs KDM5D overexpression) revealed 64 positively enriched and 101 negatively enriched pathways with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.25 when KDM5D was knocked down in LNCaP and was overexpressed in LNCaP-104R2 cells, respectively. Strikingly, there was substantial overlap between the pathways upregulated with knockdown of KDM5D in LNCaP and those downregulated with overexpression of KDM5D in LNCaP-104R2, including DNA replication and mitotic related pathways (the top two gene sets) (Fig. 1). ChIP-seq analysis exhibited that Increased H3K4me3 signals, which were found to be active transcriptional marks, were detected in those pathways, suggesting DNA replication stress by loss of KDM5D. We finally identified 69 genes negatively correlated with KDM5D expression level from our in vitro analysis and clinically available datasets. Upregulation of those 69 genes seemed to contribute to the worse outcome in TCGA and PHS/HPFS cohorts (Figure 2). We also found that DNA replication stress by loss of KDM5D might cause chromosomal instability, which renders aggressive phenotype to prostate cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of KDM5D causes aberrant DNA replication and mitotic activity leading to DNA replication stress, and those cells have a more aggressive phenotype with harboring chromosomal instability.

229db1e524de5293206efdf8f50df15a94109ef2,Exploration of genome-wide circulating microRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma: MiR-483-5p as a potential biomarker.,"BACKGROUND
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are abundant in the circulation and play a central role in diverse biologic processes; they may be useful for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.


METHODS
We conducted a two-phase, case-control study (20 pairs for the discovery set and 49 pairs for the validation set) to test the hypothesis that genome-wide dysregulation of circulating miRNAs differentiates hepatocellular carcinoma cases from controls. Taqman low-density arrays were used to examine genome-wide miRNA expression for the discovery set, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate candidate miRNAs for both discovery and validation sets.


RESULTS
Sixty-six miRNAs were found to be significantly overexpressed in plasma of hepatocellular carcinoma cases compared with controls after adjusting for false discovery rate (P < 0.05). A volcano plot indicated that seven miRNAs had greater than 2-fold case-control differences with P < 0.01. Four significant miRNAs (miR-150, miR-30c, miR-483-5p, and miR-520b) detectable in all samples with varied expression levels were further validated in a validation set. MiR-483-5p was statistically significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cases compared with controls (3.20 vs. 0.82, P < 0.0001). Hepatocellular carcinoma risk factors and clinic-pathological characteristics did not influence miR-483-5p expression. The combination of plasma miR-483-5p level and hepatitis C virus status can significantly differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma cases from controls with an area under the curve of 0.908 (P < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 75.5% and 89.8%.


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary results suggest the importance of dysregulated circulating miR-483-5p as a potential hepatocellular carcinoma biomarker.

bf83389d8439146690882172aaae34c5cfe6dcd2,Higher vascularity at infiltrated peripheral edema differentiates proneural glioblastoma subtype,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Genetic classifications are crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of glioblastoma. Recently, MR perfusion imaging techniques have demonstrated their ability to determine molecular alterations. In this work, we investigated whether perfusion markers within infiltrated peripheral edema were associated with proneural, mesenchymal, classical and neural subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS ONCOhabitats open web service was used to obtain the cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema for MRI studies of 50 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive: TCGA-GBM. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were carried out in order to assess the association between vascular features and the subtypes. For assessing specific differences, Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted. Finally, the association of overall survival with molecular and vascular features was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox models. RESULTS ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests for the maximum cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema between the four subclasses yielded false discovery rate corrected p-values of <0.001 and 0.02, respectively. This vascular feature was significantly higher (p=0.0043) in proneural patients compared to the rest of the subtypes while conducting Mann-Whitney U-test. The multivariate Cox model pointed to redundant information provided by vascular features at the peripheral edema and proneural subtype when analyzing overall survival.

2e5a0100c369f982205ecdeb233df3b37933e3dc,False discoveries and models for gene discovery.,"In the search for genes underlying complex traits, there is a tendency to impose increasingly stringent criteria to avoid false discoveries. These stringent criteria make it hard to find true effects, and we argue that it might be better to optimize our procedures for eliminating and controlling false discoveries. Focusing on achieving an acceptable ratio of true- and false-positives, we show that false discoveries could be eliminated much more efficiently using a stepwise approach. To avoid a relatively high false discovery rate, corrections for 'multiple testing' might also be needed in candidate gene studies. If the appropriate methods are used, detecting the proportion of true effects appears to be a more important determinant of the genotyping burden than the desired false discovery rate.

Although there have recently emerged some tests for graph inference based on independent samples, there is no readily available solution to test the change of brain network for paired and correlated samples. In this article, we develop a paired test of matrix graphs to infer brain connectivity network when the groups of samples are correlated. The proposed test statistic is both bias corrected and variance corrected, and achieves a small estimation error rate. The subsequent multiple testing procedure built on this test statistic is guaranteed to asymptotically control the false discovery rate at the pre-specified level. Both the methodology and theory of the new test are considerably different from the two independent samples framework, owing to the strong correlations of measurements on the same subjects before and after the stimulus activity. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposal through simulations and an analysis of an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.",2019,Medicine; Mathematics; Biology,"list(name = ""Yuting Ye"", ids = ""40508248""); list(name = ""Yin Xia"", ids = ""152428283""); list(name = ""Lexin Li"", ids = ""34491763"")",,608b27b2b542a3662bbc37dd34bd6fc1a5fcc569; 4e031ada3d6c298700b3d4b6826232013d810d9e; 9165b85d73188bd8d29ac1a47d8142c727ebcb92; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; 0d883d61e6caa4aca59e92c89c849a1d37370770; d06798476ae907160dc4ec6b88be466fdcdb8b6d; 3dd9ea53434bbc33ff6f21a38eaff7eecc556e85; e0b1e5c2b9819dfc17568d028084e3133c1e5246; 3eacf6a59043385e9244192656fef27e865c7c91; fa499a7cb25be1ee090f00a7adc920da2f2e28ab; 48311914a9fafec05538fc45909899af4ed4ad4d; 726bb1c21e4d154bcf94090a06902ee76959a118; 7944770f58b2e4b98701b4b655c419a444d13998; 2a4a3c9b6aac9733e11c8860a5be1f2d32a617bd; 7883a29dba556ecee0d36bc28e514e7793654f19; d62ce9fcb72d1f3d7775d618e4a8bf43eda9bbfd; 8fb5615e18cf9f879aa6c1f80246be2b701eb95d; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 97a27e8f921da5a13591de0527ed61864d1a1e2e; 5f9d4237f3f39a23343f60e4e317a24919967dc8; eca2e87b187fd78db7ed9f0681f318daf9ff64b0; f6c8de941330197cc120aec69c2dc957b9da69b2; e3e071378c266e9005aef13c0bd76275aed77536; 1a77e19441f3a0e030998fb2d11d9dd774582403; f1860d1be51064752593d9eb08e3f9c860db4e57; ef1bf316ce572888268aba556d8534768e8c816a; b4530e6d5d2be0e33f56d671e83a27adcb4a2903; a55df99552d6093b6150fe2ca79d017644b73935; 28ba70019c019e32a0abbab0c6c39fc64335db36; be519b639d096870ca7dc6c6727fc5c5c853e588; 3e1045b3927a4a609108cadf5fc7f38856044bb5; 89be2a0d1dfa109d92f78fa4d726194bf368178f; b2360ee2ecdbfd88e3cb64aa0fb01543e94fa223; d3a32497c44d526b8eaeee350cacb1bcab27d084; 8d4ebefc1d0f7738a7c0db26a88eb4ea66ae45bd; d65edfe2fb8127587cc0051cd20f220e3a2f2554; 654cd6c1a67d67c5678901305f2a83ae89dd9523; 96ee0e4d6ebc99fc4cdfb6c2cd4dedb7e107ef11; c54ce87ca320f0dbc8dbd693572b4922a6f44b92,Biostatistics,,
5946dea442cd5d1c5276b84c6538dbdd1ffa736b,Generalized Tensor-Based Morphometry of HIV / AIDS Using Multivariate Statistics on Strain Matrices,"This paper investigates the performance of a new multivariate method for Tensor-Based Morphometry (TBM). Statistics on Riemannian manifolds are developed that expl oit the full information in deformation tensor fields. In TBM, multi ple brain images are warped to a common neuroanatomical templat e via 3D nonlinear registration; the resulting deformation fields are analyzed statistically to identify group differences in anatomy. Rather than analyze the Jacobian determinant (volume expan sion factor) of these deformations, as is common, we retain the fu ll strain tensor and apply a manifold version of Hotellingâ€™s T 2 test to the strain matrices, in a log-Euclidean domain. In 2D and 3D MRI data from 26 HIV/AIDS patients and 14 matched healthy subjects, we compared multivariate tensor analysiversus univariate tests of simpler tensor-derived indices: the Ja cobian determinant, the trace, geodesic anisotropy, and eigenval ues of the strain tensor, and the angle of rotation of its eigenvect ors. We detected consistent, but more extensive patterns of stru ctural abnormalities, with multivariate tests on the full tensor manifold. Their improved power was established by analyzing cumulati ve p-value plots using false discovery rate (FDR) methods, appr opriately controlling for false positives. This increased detection sensitivity may empower drug trials and large-scale studie s of disease that use tensor-morphometry.",2006,,"list(name = ""Natasha Lepore"", ids = ""1702792""); list(name = ""Caroline Brun"", ids = ""144077303""); list(name = ""Yi-Yu Chou"", ids = ""1847961""); list(name = ""Ming-Chang Chiang"", ids = ""48748655""); list(name = ""Rebecca A.

e38569845bbb57ee71dfed563d8c3cd04f9e3ef1,Bayesian nonparametric areal wombling for small-scale maps with an application to urinary bladder cancer data from Connecticut.,"With increasingly abundant spatial data in the form of case counts or rates combined over areal regions (eg, ZIP codes, census tracts, or counties), interest turns to formal identification of difference ""boundaries,"" or barriers on the map, in addition to the estimated statistical map itself. ""Boundary"" refers to a border that describes vastly disparate outcomes in the adjacent areal units, perhaps caused by latent risk factors. This article focuses on developing a model-based statistical tool, equipped to identify difference boundaries in maps with a small number of areal units, also referred to as small-scale maps. This article proposes a novel and robust nonparametric boundary detection rule based on nonparametric Dirichlet processes, later referred to as Dirichlet process wombling (DPW) rule, by employing Dirichlet process-based mixture models for small-scale maps. Unlike the recently proposed nonparametric boundary detection rules based on false discovery rates, the DPW rule is free of ad hoc parameters, computationally simple, and readily implementable in freely available software for public health practitioners such as JAGS and OpenBUGS and yet provides statistically interpretable boundary detection in small-scale wombling. We offer a detailed simulation study and an application of our proposed approach to a urinary bladder cancer incidence rates dataset between 1990 and 2012 in the 8 counties in Connecticut.",2017,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Rajarshi Guhaniyogi"", ids = ""49665643"")",,4af31dfe7f6f2c209cc384b76c7530a3079a29cf; acc8fccebdcf0782ea821e737d58e489efaadc14; feb3cba92c3773d44417831705b1b9e695e9941c; 0d9fd395a162d95d73db573f87f327e8a4b0b5b7; f16c0699a873b0209a370e8e6301b0189785c614; 059fb69e6908899f9c1f47319f3e8ffede715e35; d5c9fa75914cfa8f62243260dac7de5d1b4a41ae; d40e8d1a2aa3b0945b1e83202aa2764113a69e14; 3cbdef428653bff638729c01c96679ef257dfbb2; df25adb36860c1ad9edaac04b8855a2f19e79c5b; 263f103fd2bfbbd6aeb392c6519d3f590e647c0a; 3a9f9ed7810ff6889bdc8dea3c0b2765d39bb117; 6189c8c66e1d74aaa01bb530cbb3db3b95e73f48; 80d188dfc902dc3067cb9cbda40f3a126e8e56e7; a0afa4ec10b2b060aff0ec676a661c8013c7df1d; f6ea5c9044b12ff9fb21115f985d852876f60076; 2704d00d53390231877d708139c38e1125b8baa6; e1ba33f56f75c40aed15538073e377c23f4013da; 2cecc34e76fb8fa07231b191ffb8f1d82f8eed78; c37a1c197137046fcc95e0c0fbb8280939210e8b; cadbaac4bd8f251938d93252cad03580dad6713d; b5a8c1db2d289463f7d0d436f809c64fb30ad602; 1c9ac8aefa88160cfde245bf733c2490a35067bf; 5e302cc502e392201ef8a14f173a2191d855156b; 2bc5a430a904138387bd671c7071c1350dda3ba2; c5c4476452d259ecff658f419301457b57275399; 82fb9c0669535a43ee03b3198f870c5e195be611; 764ad2e83d5e244bf34b79d22eeb7530e060d933,Statistics in medicine,36 25,"

099f0a5c081ee97ba5fbbbe31921beb42bf67057,Development of a Reproducible Prognostic Gene Signature to Predict the Clinical Outcome in Patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma,"Alongside various clinical prognostic factors for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) such as the international prognostic index (IPI) components (ie, age, tumor stage, performance status, serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, and number of extranodal sites), prognostic gene signatures have recently shown promising efficacy. However, previously developed signatures for DLBCL suffer from many major inadequacies such as lack of reproducibility in external datasets, high number of members (genes) in a signature, and inconsistent association with the survival time in various datasets. Accordingly, we sought to find a reproducible prognostic gene signature with a minimal number of genes. Seven datasetsâ€”namely GSE10856 (420 samples), GSE31312 (470 samples), GSE69051 (157 samples), GSE32918 (172 samples), GSE4475 (123 samples), GSE11318 (203 samples), and GSE34171 (91 samples)â€”were employed. The datasets were randomly categorized into training (1219 samples comprising GSE10856, GSE31312, GSE69051, and GSE32918) and validation (417 samples consisting of GSE4475, GSE11318, and GSE34171) groups. Through the univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, common genes associated with the overall survival time with a P value less than 0.001 and a false discovery rate less than 5% were identified in 1219 patients included in the 4 training datasets. Thereafter, the common genes were entered into a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis encompassing the common genes and the international prognostic index (IPI) factors as covariates, and then only common genes with a significant level of difference (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01 and z-score >2 or <âˆ’2) were selected to reconstruct the prognostic signature. After the analyses, a 7-gene prognostic signature was developed, which efficiently predicted the survival time in the training dataset (Psâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Subsequently, this signature was tested in 3 validation datasets. Our signature was able to strongly predict clinical outcomes in the validation datasets (Psâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). In the multivariate Cox analysis, our outcome predictor was independent of the routine IPI components in both training datasets (Psâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). Furthermore, our outcome predictor was the most powerful independent prognostic variable (Psâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). We developed a potential reproducible prognostic gene signature which was able to robustly discriminate low-risk patients with DLBCL from high-risk ones.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohamad Zamani-Ahmadmahmudi"", ids = ""1399825876""); list(name = ""Seyed Mahdi Nassiri"", ids = ""40429788"")",,ec8ab8b711949433cd5b7d7375ffd35030f8d0e5; 276355a655b4d7d2484faee194adb95ff16a596b; 435641b4a284a5ba4a83520d66959fe512d67517; 00a6745954e63935976c6342d04e6184a4d168c2; 4937646ddc9b88cd388f54bca7a6f2740bf67c76; 02e3b7fe0e0f4312040498f5b372a021cdc02c78; 42de993af8515c14f570f949464083e7a82bc943; 00d43a84f7bd187acb215a6a3f068f23cae4b97e; ac3f30f549a824914e1ea190c43121270e1a9ae5; 723a7cb0d17c6f1fc723c2cbbcb4f777633efba8; ccf3a4fa0ac9584affa93e4a2b4f5c151f60b1a1; 1baec9d466b181ad95175c44e48ef8bf6a1f88d1; 373f58aa40b174e828d931395253905f724ce799; 8407e02edbb92ade963e3150cb1886135c95966e; 43f18c096c932d5b2bdab8b0cd9254122be44802; 5e7f60f98d0c884b4739e75300422855fb466e69; 569cd7a400a2b438c86c288c2b31479dc62e563c; d57431d5a575be486db85d52d0cd95e16eb0fcc8; d9ed2d1bf3748972611e42b4cf0bcf724f46592c; e96411e5d13e7a4e586ec8c87cfb1cccbcbb3bd4; 2c4bcf5eed2cd1d4b1c76b930d548d80520735f2; 0f352adcbb07ec0847329bfa6a6906506ccb3501; 6a52e29d2c51ba7b6dfb861f2e83b973ddc9e764; a28c6b1eeac90425a5901aae897ba61c77e0e1bc; ec0730119232dd59f61f71f3c27dd8572bd74db4; 95da62494d98751effb9d13bdb42416ec72a3376; 9e807b69786cbfa417537175de0fe628eb0fbb4e,Scientific Reports,9,
fed64e7fc4fb53959d5a8e769cb6ce7af4ba2c77,Expression of Phosphofructokinase in Skeletal Muscle Is Influenced by Genetic Variation and Associated With Insulin Sensitivity,"Using an integrative approach in which genetic variation, gene expression, and clinical phenotypes are assessed in relevant tissues may help functionally characterize the contribution of genetics to disease susceptibility. We sought to identify genetic variation influencing skeletal muscle gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]) as well as expression associated with measures of insulin sensitivity. We investigated associations of 3,799,401 genetic variants in expression of >7,000 genes from three cohorts (n = 104). We identified 287 genes with cis-acting eQTLs (false discovery rate [FDR] <5%; P < 1.96 Ã— 10(-5)) and 49 expression-insulin sensitivity phenotype associations (i.e., fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, and BMI) (FDR <5%; P = 1.34 Ã— 10(-4)). One of these associations, fasting insulin/phosphofructokinase (PFKM), overlaps with an eQTL. Furthermore, the expression of PFKM, a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, was nominally associated with glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (P = 0.026; n = 42) and overexpressed (Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.03) in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D (n = 102) compared with normoglycemic controls (n = 87). The PFKM eQTL (rs4547172; P = 7.69 Ã— 10(-6)) was nominally associated with glucose uptake, glucose oxidation rate, intramuscular triglyceride content, and metabolic flexibility (P = 0.016-0.048; n = 178). We explored eQTL results using published data from genome-wide association studies (DIAGRAM and MAGIC), and a proxy for the PFKM eQTL (rs11168327; r(2) = 0.75) was nominally associated with T2D (DIAGRAM P = 2.7 Ã— 10(-3)). Taken together, our analysis highlights PFKM as a potential regulator of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sarah Keildson"", ids = ""4560138""); list(name = ""JoÃ£o Fadista"", ids = ""4495573""); list(name = ""Claes Ladenvall"", ids = ""6906022""); list(name = ""Ã…sa K Hedman"", ids = ""4349954""); list(name = ""Targ Elgzyri"", ids = ""6528543""); list(name = ""Kerrin S.

915d7d164effb69a1f8f863732f699b40acccaf7,Abstract PR08: Identification of novel methylated genomic regions in invasive cervical cancer using a genome-wide approach,"Introduction: In the US, an estimated 35,000 cancer cases per year are attributable to Human papillomavirus (HPV), including cancers of the cervix, anus and oropharynx. Despite the availability of an HPV-targeted vaccine, issues with low uptake and significant lag time from vaccination to cancer prevention will result in cervical cancer continuing to be a substantial burden to US and world-wide populations. It is becoming increasingly clear that epigenetic events play a critical role in HPV-associated carcinogenesis, including changes in host genome DNA methylation patterns. In the cervix, methylation patterns have been shown to be altered; however, there have been inconclusive findings as to the most informative methylation targets in cervical cancer. We hypothesize that there are novel epigenetic alterations in HPV-associated cervical cancer and these changes may be early detection biomarkers in pre-invasive cervical lesions. In this study, we sought to identify epigenetic differences in HPV-positive cervical cancers compared to HPV-positive normal tissue using genome-wide methylation arrays and to explore if these differences can be identified in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 lesions. Methods: DNA was extracted from 24 frozen cervical tissues (9 normal, 5 CIN 3 and 10 invasive cancers) following pathology review and macrodissection. Bisulfite-modified DNA was interrogated for methylation at over 450,000 CpG loci using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. HPV genotyping was conducted using SFP10 LiPA HPV-typing system. Differential methylation between normal and tumors at individual CpG loci was determined by t-test with significance set by a false discovery rate (or q-value) and final sets were restricted to those with a mean difference in Î²-valuesâ‰¥0.3. Next, using a window-based approach, we examined clusters of CpG loci within gene coding regions or CpG islands. Finally, a binary classification strategy was used for each gene set of probes, where a probe was defined as methylated if the Î²-values were above the minimum point in the bi-modal histogram. Sensitivity and specificity for each gene at the set methylation cut-point was determined. Results: A total of 24 HPV positive tissues were examined in this study (9 normal, 5 CIN 3 and 10 invasive cancers). A total of 321 CpG loci displayed differential methylation with mean difference â‰¥0.5 in tumors compared to normal (FDR corrected q Conclusions: We have identified several novel methylated CpG loci and genomic regions in HPV-associated cervical cancer, some of which were also found to be altered in CIN 3 lesions. Validation of these novel CpG loci in a larger population of women with cervical dysplasia and cancer is warranted. A number of these novel methylated sites may emerge as promising biomarkers for the early detection of cervical cancer and possibly, for other HPV-associated malignancies.

c62b8b7c9f6882c393b0553f11f69fbab226d946,circMeta: a unified computational framework for genomic feature annotation and differential expression analysis of circular RNAs,"MOTIVATION
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of non-coding RNAs generated from non-canonical back-splicing events, have emerged to play key roles in many biological processes. Though numerous tools have been developed to detect circRNAs from rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data based on back-splicing junction-spanning reads, computational tools to identify critical genomic features regulating circRNA biogenesis are still lacking. In addition, rigorous statistical methods to perform differential expression (DE) analysis of circRNAs remain under-developed.


RESULTS
We present circMeta, a unified computational framework for circRNA analyses. circMeta has three primarily functional modules: (i) a pipeline for comprehensive genomic feature annotation related to circRNA biogenesis, including length of introns flanking circularized exons, repetitive elements such as Alu elements and SINEs, competition score for forming circulation and RNA editing in back-splicing flanking introns (ii) a two-stage DE approach of circRNAs based on circular junction reads to quantitatively compare circRNA levels (iii) a Bayesian hierarchical model for DE analysis of circRNAs based on the ratio of circular reads to linear reads in back-splicing sites to study spatial and temporal regulation of circRNA production. Both proposed DE methods without and with considering host genes outperform existing methods by obtaining better control of false discovery rate (FDR) and comparable statistical power. Moreover, the identified DE circRNAs by the proposed two-stage DE approach display potential biological functions in Gene Ontology and circRNAmiRNA-mRNA networks that are not able to be detected using existing mRNA DE methods. Furthermore, top DE circRNAs have been further validated by RT-qPCR using divergent primers spanning back-splicing junctions.

9252b984f3de879c4f5cc3585a3654f93fb06f10,Association Between Genetic Traits for Immune-Mediated Diseases and Alzheimer Disease.,"IMPORTANCE
Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, places a large burden on families and society. Although epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between inflammation and AD, their relationship is not well understood and could have implications for treatment and prevention strategies.


OBJECTIVE
To determine whether a subset of genes involved with increased risk of inflammation are also associated with increased risk for AD.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
In a genetic epidemiology study conducted in July 2015, we systematically investigated genetic overlap between AD (International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project stage 1) and Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and psoriasis using summary data from genome-wide association studies at multiple academic clinical research centers. P values and odds ratios from genome-wide association studies of more than 100â€¯000 individuals were from previous comparisons of patients vs respective control cohorts. Diagnosis for each disorder was previously established for the parent study using consensus criteria.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
The primary outcome was the pleiotropic (conjunction) false discovery rate P value. Follow-up for candidate variants included neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology; longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores as a measure of cognitive dysfunction (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative); and gene expression in AD vs control brains (Gene Expression Omnibus data).


RESULTS
Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate Pâ€‰<â€‰.05) were associated with both AD and immune-mediated diseases. Of these, rs2516049 (closest gene HLA-DRB5; conjunction false discovery rate Pâ€‰=â€‰.04 for AD and psoriasis, 5.37â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 for AD, and 6.03â€‰Ã—â€‰10-15 for psoriasis) and rs12570088 (closest gene IPMK; conjunction false discovery rate Pâ€‰=â€‰.009 for AD and Crohn disease, Pâ€‰=â€‰5.73â€‰Ã—â€‰10-6 for AD, and 6.57â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 for Crohn disease) demonstrated the same direction of allelic effect between AD and the immune-mediated diseases. Both rs2516049 and rs12570088 were significantly associated with neurofibrillary tangle pathology (Pâ€‰=â€‰.01352 and .03151, respectively); rs2516049 additionally correlated with longitudinal decline on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores (Î² [SE], 0.405 [0.190]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.03). Regarding gene expression, HLA-DRA and IPMK transcript expression was significantly altered in AD brains compared with control brains (HLA-DRA: Î² [SE], 0.155 [0.024]; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.97â€‰Ã—â€‰10-10; IPMK: Î² [SE], -0.096 [0.013]; Pâ€‰=â€‰7.57â€‰Ã—â€‰10-13).

d150083af46a7a39f26b939247e674d9ad945382,Aberrant connective tissue differentiation towards cartilage and bone underlies human keloids in African Americans,"Keloids are benign fibroproliferative tumors more frequently found among African Americans. Until now, keloid etiopathogenesis is not fully understood. To characterize keloids in African Americans, we performed transcriptional profiling of biopsies from large chronic keloids, adjacent non-lesional (NL) skin (n=3) and a newly formed keloid lesion using Affymetrix HGU133 2.0 plus arrays. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were performed to confirm increased expression of relevant genes. We identified 1202 upregulated and 961 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between keloid and NL skin; 1819 up- and 1867 downregulated DEGs between newly formed keloid and NL skin; and 492 up- and 775 downregulated DEGs between chronic and newly formed keloid (fold change >2, false discovery rate <0.05). Many of the top upregulated DEGs between chronic keloid and NL skin and between newly formed keloid and NL skin are involved in bone/cartilage formation including Fibrillin 2 (FBN2), Collagen type X alpha 1, Asporin (ASPN), Cadherin 11 (CDH11), Bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP1), Secreted phosphoprotein 1 and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). qRT-PCR confirmed significant (P<.05) upregulation of BMP1, RUNX2, CDH11 and FBN2 in chronic keloid compared to NL skin. IHC staining showed increased protein expression of ASPN, CDH11, BMP1 and RUNX2 on chronic and newly formed keloid compared to NL skin. Our study shows that large keloids in African Americans represent a dysplasia of cutaneous connective tissue towards immature cartilage or bone differentiation. The phenotype is potentially regulated by overexpression of RUNX2. This knowledge may give insights to guide the development of better treatment for the disease in the future.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Judilyn Fuentes-Duculan"", ids = ""1398155197""); list(name = ""Kathleen M.

081b4667c33a627fa9bdfbb8c18f4a7b4c9aad3c,"Effects of threshold choice on the results of gene expression profiling, using microarray analysis, in a model feeding experiment with rats.","Global gene expression studies using microarray technology are widely employed to identify biological processes which are influenced by a treatment e.g. a specific diet. Affected processes are characterized by a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (functional annotation analysis). However, different choices of statistical thresholds to select candidates for differential expression will alter the resulting candidates list. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of applying a False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction and different fold change thresholds in statistical analysis of microarray data on diet-affected biological processes based on a significantly increased proportion of differentially expressed genes. In a model feeding experiment with rats fed genetically modified food additives, animals received a supplement of either lyophilized inactivated recombinant VP60 baculovirus (rBV-VP60) or lyophilized inactivated wild type baculovirus (wtBV). Comparative expression profiling was done in spleen, liver and small intestine mucosa. We demonstrated the extent to which threshold choice can affect the biological processes identified as significantly regulated and thus the conclusion drawn from the microarray data. In our study, the combined application of a moderate fold change threshold (FCâ‰¥1.5) and a stringent FDR threshold (qâ‰¤0.05) exhibited high reliability of biological processes identified as differentially regulated. The application of a stringent FDR threshold of qâ‰¤0.05 seems to be an essential prerequisite to reduce considerably the number of false positives. Microarray results of selected differentially expressed molecules were validated successfully by using real-time RT-PCR.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Anja Hartmann"", ids = ""153790617""); list(name = ""Gerd Nuernberg"", ids = ""47069114""); list(name = ""Dirk Repsilber"", ids = ""2407407""); list(name = ""Pawel Janczyk"", ids = ""6605052""); list(name = ""Christina J.

f4c5ef4c0b35ce3c49c27a1a3ffa659acb3ebc15,Identifying the effects of visceral interoception on human brain connectome: A multivariate analysis of covariance of fMRI data,"Sources of variations in the neural circuitry of the human brain and interrelationship between intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are still a matter of debate and ongoing research. Here, we applied a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) based on high-dimensional independent component analysis (ICA) to identify the effects of interoception and related variables on human brain connectome. Fifteen healthy right-handed subjects (all females, age range 21 - 48 years; mean age = 30.3, SD = 8.7 years) underwent a blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that included continuous intravesical saline infusion and drainage. The design matrix included the intravesical fullness, subject fullness rating, normalized right and left insula thickness, age, and neuropsychological assessments (Mini-Mental State Exam; MMSE, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) as covariates of interest. Univariate tests were also performed with a reduced design matrix (p <; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate) to study the nature and extent of the relationship between these covariates and three ICA outcome measures, namely, the spatial map intensity, frequency spectral power, and functional network connectivity. Results showed significant effects of interoception (intravesical fullness) on spatial map intensity of the salience network (anchored by insula and anterior cingulate cortex) and the frontoparietal central executive network, The left and right insula thickness influenced the spatial map intensity of the subcortical network, and the attention/cognitive and default-mode networks, respectively. The intravesical fullness also showed an effect on the spectral power of the subcortical network. Further investigations of the effect of internal (bodily) sensations on the ICN properties can provide an invaluable tool for understanding the role of interoception in health and illness.",2016,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Behnaz Jarrahi"", ids = ""2581057""); list(name = ""Dante Mantini"", ids = ""2702784"")",e2fb56f6aa098ec82319b084db98fbd8f3b5c59c,16e1d74262355b27cc21026e65c89468de7d60f6; 6c3bc7dec2c48c9c3dddf52217dda1fe37bdab8f; 5b315d88d81fe1bbf20b9b4b1ebab40d1efd1aed; 85ebd32611cb404704042da433c94dac2b161ff4; c2cae15f8335f2c4d28c78a6e145e1665a70e0b7; ae4832cab2de0e20bcb704cf8e4eb5cd153f1756; 7e21226e1a42301eb91fe3fc609decfe7903365e; cf1d949e5197753c304e2e57ef83d51543eb176f; 1bdad148e76307af9f4a5d918a963137f419a335; c34c6696122c623f4196afe20e73ca99ce94e948; a358164d18f2ee42e9b484ed7d319a92f370f99b; 055411f28a5e28c46c3f0079d397783afc721021; 5f2d40bdb541d43ce97b81b5a7f588808e7048df; eed30ec6c65deb69e8f403dd22949a85de2ec423; 37eb08cce9b740f74e2fc3d254f0f2890c7afdf6; c3e26b9bfec3a313f48f1815e991934ebe53fab0; ea02e7f7cea571d2b5c78e57b278a6ef17d8ff24; 94568c698349b0237b9656d80d2e6bfac1bb5dd3; 7ef16f997257c30bd5a36b1dec6a3329afd35c4f; a03889ae32e07efc69235467512bf2474c1d5371; ee94504092bc3cd8ab5134c39e42e2e298cb2e8a,2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),,5558-5562
4beca8b3b68747e1625fe928b6eae7f98faff103,P18-16 Unique spatial patterns of cerebral activations to innocuous versus noxious heat on functional magnetic resonance imaging,"Methods: In this fMRI study 15 healthy, left-handed subjects (28.9Â±9.6 years) and 11 healthy right-handed subjects (35.5Â±8.6 years) performed bimanual index finger abductions and adductions. In a 2x3 paradigm, subjects had to move their index fingers either in symmetric or in parallel mode in a congruous position, i.e. both palms down, and in two incongruous positions, i.e. either the left or right palm up, respectively. fMRI data were analysed with general linear model (random effects analysis) in an omnibus statistics and with small volume correction based on the main movement effect of all six conditions in comparison with rest. Significant signal changes had a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 exceeding clusters of 50 activated voxels. Results: In the incongruous conditions compared with the congruous condition, there was an fMRI-signal increase in a bilateral fronto-parietal network involving motor, premotor somatosensory, and inferior parietal cortical areas. Whereas turning the right hand evoked a predominantly contralateral pattern in right-handers, activations were more bilaterally in the left-handers. In addition, the occipito-temporal cortex probably corresponding to human visual area MT was activated bilaterally in the left-handers. The activation of area MT was specific for the incongruouscongruous contrast in the left-handers but detectable in comparison with rest also in the right-handers. Conclusion: Our observations show extra-activations in sensorimotor control areas during a perceptual dissociation in rightand left-handers. In addition, our data suggest an involvement of visual imagery in the sensory guidance of bimanual coordination in left-handers.",2010,Psychology,"list(name = ""M. -T.

By ChIP-seq, using 15.1 and 12.9 million uniquely mapped sequence reads, and an estimated false discovery rate of less than 0.001, we identified 41,582 and 11,004 putative STAT1-binding regions in stimulated and unstimulated cells, respectively. Of the 34 loci known to contain STAT1 interferon-responsive binding sites, ChIP-seq found 24 (71%). ChIP-seq targets were enriched in sequences similar to known STAT1 binding motifs.

890a422b18b666dd59cfb840a559f66df993b28f,"Autism spectrum disorders, endocrine disrupting compounds, and heavy metals in amniotic fluid: a case-control study","BackgroundEvidence has indicated that some non-inherited factors such as exposure to environmental pollutants are associated with neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies report that endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and some metals, have adverse effects on the fetal neurodevelopment. The aim of this study was to measure the amniotic fluid (AF) levels of EDCs and metals as well as the receptor transactivities induced by AF and investigate the possible link between prenatal exposure to EDCs and heavy metals and ASD risk.MethodsIn this case-control study, we included AF samples of 75 ASD cases and 135 frequency-matched controls and measured the levels of the endogenous sex hormones, PFAS, and elements including heavy metals. The combined effect of endogenous hormones and EDCs on the receptor of estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), aryl hydrocarbon (AhR), and thyroid hormone-like activity were also determined and expressed as receptor ligand equivalents. We assessed the associations of AF levels of chemicals, sex hormones, and receptor activities with ASD risk using unconditional logistical regression analyses. To control for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used and q values less than 0.25 were designated as statistical significance.ResultsPFAS and metals were detectable in AF samples. The ASD cases had significantly lower AF levels of PFAS than controls, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.410 (95% CI 0.174, 0.967; pâ€‰=â€‰0.042; FDR qvalueâ€‰=â€‰0.437) for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The principal component, including PFAS congeners, copper, iron, and estrogenic activity, was significantly inversely associated with ASD risk (adjusted ORâ€‰=â€‰0.100; 95% CI 0.016, 0.630; pâ€‰=â€‰0.014; FDR qvalueâ€‰=â€‰0.098).Testosterone level in AF weakly associated with ASD risk (adjusted ORâ€‰=â€‰1.002; 95% CI 1.000, 1.004; pâ€‰=â€‰0.05). However, after multiple comparison correction, the association was not significant (FDR qvalueâ€‰=â€‰0.437). No significant associations between AF-induced receptor transactivities and ASD risk were observed. The adjusted OR was 2.176 (95%CI 0.115, 41.153) for the ratio of the combined androgenic activity to combined estrogenic activity.ConclusionsThe presence of PFAS and heavy metals in AF indicates that they can cross the placenta. The inverse association between levels of PFAS congeners in AF and ASD risk might relate to the weak estrogenic activities and anti-androgenic activities of PFAS.The observed tendency of positive association between the ratio of combined androgenic effect to the combined estrogenic effect and ASD risk needs further studies to explore whether EDCs together with endogenous hormones play a role in the development of ASD.",2019,Psychology;

a8863fe78750e0d7fda98f8cd0f1d44b309eb188,"How often should we expect to be wrong? Statistical power, P values, and the expected prevalence of false discoveries","&NA; There is a clear perception in the literature that there is a crisis in reproducibility in the biomedical sciences. Many underlying factors contributing to the prevalence of irreproducible results have been highlighted with a focus on poor design and execution of experiments along with the misuse of statistics. While these factors certainly contribute to irreproducibility, relatively little attention outside of the specialized statistical literature has focused on the expected prevalence of false discoveries under idealized circumstances. In other words, when everything is done correctly, how often should we expect to be wrong? Using a simple simulation of an idealized experiment, it is possible to show the central role of sample size and the related quantity of statistical power in determining the false discovery rate, and in accurate estimation of effect size. According to our calculations, based on current practice many subfields of biomedical science may expect their discoveries to be false at least 25% of the time, and the only viable course to correct this is to require the reporting of statistical power and a minimum of 80% power (1 âˆ’ &bgr; = 0.80) for all studies.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael J.

a31ed83805a8762d65bbd32135a429b3d50ce7ea,Assessing the effects of multiple markers in genetic association studies,"It is believed that human diseases and their underlying causal pathways involve a complex interplay between multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. The search for relevant genetic variants, which typically have very small individual effects, is challenging. While typically genetic association studies involve testing for association between the phenotype and each individual genetic variant (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP), it is widely recognized that jointly assessing the effects of multiple genetic markers can increase power or provide the opportunity to test different hypotheses than those addressed by single-maker analyses. Various statistical approaches that enable the joint use of data from multiple genetic markers are under development. This eBook contains a selection of manuscripts dealing with various aspects of assessing the effects of multiple markers in genetic association studies, including: gene or region-based association testing approaches, particularly for rare variant analysis; study of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions; model selection and prediction using high-dimensional genomic data. 
 
Multi-marker tests of association can be used to maximize power to detect association at the gene or regional level. The study by Burkett et al. (2013) included in this issue considered an approach for a multi-marker regional test. In particular, they demonstrate how gene genealogies estimated from haplotype data can be used to find disease-predisposing genetic variants and propose a tree-based test of association based on assessing haplotype similarity of cases versus controls. Noting that genotype correlations within an LD block asymptotically lead to a multivariate normal distribution for score test statistics, Taub et al. (2013) developed a set of weights for markers to maximize power of multi-marker association tests, and found that a method previously proposed by Conneely and Boehnke (2007) is a practical and powerful method for a range of scenarios. 
 
Region or gene-level tests are particularly useful for rare variant analysis, because the power of typical single-marker association tests is very low for rare variants. Several manuscripts in this issue focused on rare variant analysis. Notably, Thomas et al. (2013) provide a comprehensive review on methods and analysis strategies for next generation sequencing studies, focusing on two major types of study designs: two-phase design for subject subsampling, and family-based design for variant prioritizing. Various issues are investigated using simulations and preliminary data from two studies, providing valuable guidance for sequencing study design in both pedigrees and unrelated samples. Stewart and Cerise (2013) also suggested harnessing the power of family based designs in association tests and prioritization of genetic variants/regionsâ€”with a particular interest in SNPs with MAFs between 0.03 and 0.12. They proposed a novel non-parametric association test, which can accommodate large families and case-control data. It is expected that such method will better inform the design of follow-up sequencing efforts. Yoo et al. (2013) proposed a multiple regression method for gene-level association tests for quantitative traits, using both common and rare variants, and found that their approach applied to both common and rare variants provided a robust and powerful alternative to analyzing the common and rare SNPs separately. Also in this issue, Xu et al. (2014) explored the potential utility of stratified false discovery rate for region-based association tests for rare variant data, concluding that their simulations demonstrated low power for window-based tests, and that the estimated FDR values tended to be much smaller than the true FDRs, likely at least partially due to long-range linkage disequilibrium. They suggested that use of external annotation information may improve power, but warned that sample sizes in current sequencing studies will not enable detection of many causal variants of realistic effect sizes. Finally, Cook et al. (2014) explored the impact of genotyping errors on rare variant association tests. They conclude that different types of errors in SNP genotyping can lead to inflated type I error rate and decreased power, while certain rare variant tests and study designs may be more robust to genotype errors. 
 
Investigation of gene-gene interactions also involves multi-marker analyses. Six manuscripts in this eBook addressed gene-gene interactions, or the related topic of gene-environment interactions. Lee et al. (2013) and Sung et al. (2014) investigated methods for the analysis of interactions in family data. Chen and Guo, and Millstein discussed potential solutions to the challenge of high dimensionality in interaction studies. Simino et al. (2013) and de las Fuentes et al. (2013) report their analyses of large-scale epidemiologic cohorts, studying gene-alcohol and gene-drug interactions, respectively. These papers highlighted two key challenges in the current applications of methods for detecting interaction effects. First, computational burden can become prohibitive when interactions are investigated in genome-wide data. Chen and Guo (2013) explored the possibility of overcoming this constraint through the use of processor graphics cards (GPU), while in the analysis of longitudinal family data, Sung et al. (2014) proposed using a computationally less intensive method based on the hierarchical linear model (HLM). Second, it is well-known that interaction analyses require very large sample sizes, and real data analyses often fail to achieve genome-wide significance (as shown in de las Fuentes et al., 2013). It remains an open question to what extent top-ranking (but non-significant) findings are informative in prioritizing genes for future studies. 
 
Genetic risk prediction is an important area of growing interest, which is ideally performed in a multi-marker framework. Although risk prediction is recognized as an important goal of human genetics research, efficient statistical methods are still not well-established, and few studies have demonstrated successful use of genetic risk prediction for complex traits. In this issue, Che and Motsinger-Reif (2013) expand on their earlier work comparing simple genetic risk scores with weighted risk scores, demonstrating that the weighted methods outperform simple count risk scores in general, including more complex situations involving interactions or presence of linkage disequilibrium. Using longitudinal data, Wineinger et al. (2013) applied methods including n-fold cross-validation procedures to generate lipid genomic prediction models based on previously reported genetic markers, which led to improved prediction over non-genetic risk models. 
 
Achieving both computational (and cost) efficiency in addition to statistical efficiency is a key challenge in multi-marker testing. The contribution by Millstein and Volfson (2013) provides a novel method (and an R package â€œfdrciâ€) where permutations can be used to estimate FDR including confidence intervals in a non-parametric manner, which can account for dependencies among tests and is computationally parsimonious.

9d2e67c1776bfe1a7487a34b2bce1821ef01eccf,Systematic analysis of breast atypical hyperplasia-associated hub genes and pathways based on text mining,"The purpose of this study was to describe breast atypical hyperplasia (BAH)-related gene expression and to systematically analyze the functions, pathways, and networks of BAH-related hub genes. On the basis of natural language processing, gene data for BAH were extracted from the PubMed database using text mining. The enriched Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were obtained using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database. Hub genes were identified as genes that interact with at least 10 other genes within the BAH-related gene network. In total, 138 BAH-associated genes were identified as significant (P<0.05), and 133 pathways were identified as significant (P<0.05, false discovery rate<0.05). A BAH-related protein network that included 81 interactions was constructed. Twenty genes were determined to interact with at least 10 others (P<0.05, false discovery rate<0.05) and were identified as the BAH-related hub genes of this protein-protein interaction network. These 20 genes are TP53, PIK3CA, JUN, MYC, EGFR, CCND1, AKT1, ERBB2, CTNN1B, ESR1, IGF-1, VEGFA, HRAS, CDKN1B, CDKN1A,PCNA, HGF, HIF1A, RB1, and STAT5A. This study may help to disclose the molecular mechanisms of BAH development and provide implications for BAH-targeted therapy or even breast cancer prevention. Nevertheless, connections between certain genes and BAH require further exploration.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

7779ace735356136c7ecacd892ebcdf238e5650d,Nonparametric Bayes modeling for case control studies with many predictors.,"It is common in biomedical research to run case-control studies involving high-dimensional predictors, with the main goal being detection of the sparse subset of predictors having a significant association with disease. Usual analyses rely on independent screening, considering each predictor one at a time, or in some cases on logistic regression assuming no interactions. We propose a fundamentally different approach based on a nonparametric Bayesian low rank tensor factorization model for the retrospective likelihood. Our model allows a very flexible structure in characterizing the distribution of multivariate variables as unknown and without any linear assumptions as in logistic regression. Predictors are excluded only if they have no impact on disease risk, either directly or through interactions with other predictors. Hence, we obtain an omnibus approach for screening for important predictors. Computation relies on an efficient Gibbs sampler. The methods are shown to have high power and low false discovery rates in simulation studies, and we consider an application to an epidemiology study of birth defects.",2016,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jing Zhou"", ids = ""1711615""); list(name = ""Amy H.

9d7957eca9f1d924f962b2861b55119586e380b1,Profiling placental and fetal DNA methylation in human neural tube defects,"BackgroundThe incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) declined by about 40Â % in Canada with the introduction of a national folic acid (FA) fortification program. Despite the fact that few Canadians currently exhibit folate deficiency, NTDs are still the second most common congenital abnormality. FA fortification may have aided in reducing the incidence of NTDs by overcoming abnormal one carbon metabolism cycling, the process which provides one carbon units for methylation of DNA. We considered that NTDs persisting in a folate-replete population may also occur in the context of FA-independent compromised one carbon metabolism, and that this might manifest as abnormal DNA methylation (DNAm). Second trimester human placental chorionic villi, kidney, spinal cord, brain, and muscle were collected from 19 control, 22 spina bifida, and 15 anencephalic fetuses in British Columbia, Canada. DNA was extracted, assessed for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype and for genome-wide DNAm using repetitive elements, in addition to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450k) array.ResultsNo difference in repetitive element DNAm was noted between NTD status groups. Using a false discovery rateÂ <0.05 and average group difference in DNAmÂ â‰¥0.05, differentially methylated array sites were identified only in (1) the comparison of anencephaly to controls in chorionic villi (nÂ =Â 4 sites) and (2) the comparison of spina bifida to controls in kidney (nÂ =Â 3342 sites).ConclusionsWe suggest that the distinctive DNAm of spina bifida kidneys may be consequent to the neural tube defect or reflective of a common etiology for abnormal neural tube and renal development. Though there were some small shifts in DNAm in the other tested tissues, our data do not support the long-standing hypothesis of generalized altered genome-wide DNAm in NTDs. This finding may be related to the fact that most Canadians are not folate deficient, but it importantly opens the field to the investigation of other epigenetic and non-epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of NTDs.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Elmer M.

7ec483d70f18ff6b70664998e0fe9479e07b5dfa,Abstract 3655: Development of a Large Scale Predictive Atlas of Clinical Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke,"Background: Neuroimaging studies including diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging identify the location and neuroanatomic extent of brain ischemia in the acute phase of infarction. Although there has been substantial progress in using early neuroimaging studies to predict whether localized regions of brain tissue will proceed to infarction or recover, there has been little effort to define imaging parameters that predict which of the patientâ€™s acute functional deficits will remain or resolve with potential recanalization/reperfusion treatments. This information may be particularly important in late time windows when the number of patients with salvageable penumbral tissue progressively declines. We previously reported development of a proof of concept acute stroke imaging atlas correlating DWI lesions and NIHSS items in a relatively small number of subjects. The goal of the current analysis was to expand this atlas to include a much larger number of cases. Methods: As part of a global project aimed at creating a large scale stroke-specific predictive brain atlas, we correlated acute DWI lesion location with the presence of individual sub-item scores from the NIHSS. Inclusion criteria were: acute ischemic stroke; brain MRI (including DWI) performed within 24 hours of symptom onset; and baseline NIHSS score available. Intramural NINDS provided the imaging and clinical data. Acute DWI images from all subjects were aligned to a common neuroanatomic coordinate system. Chi square images were calculated on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Results: A total of 400 patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 69, range 21-98. Baseline NIHSS was median 5, mean 7, range 0-32. The figure shows representative axial slices from the atlas, including color-coded chi square values, using a false discovery rate of 5%, for anatomic regions in which there was a significant correlation between NIHSS sub-item symptom presence and DWI hyperintensity. Conclusions: Employing a large dataset including 400 acute stroke patients, we have developed a large scale voxel-based stroke atlas correlating NIHSS sub-items employing acute DWI lesion data. The maps illustrate the neuroanatomic representation of the NIHSS sub-items in standardized space. An important next step will incorporate acute diffusion and perfusion MR imaging to predict long-term outcome for two scenarios: untreated vs. treated with recanalization therapy. This information may then assist in guiding treatment decisions for late recanalization therapies.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chelsea S.

2dfc9307d4908c0ab1d64b1e4578e29d8180dd64,Distinct transcriptomic profiles of early-onset atopic dermatitis in blood and skin of pediatric patients.,"BACKGROUND
Atopic dermatitis (AD) predominantly affects young children, but our understanding of AD pathogenesis is based on skin and blood samples from long-standing adult AD. Genomic biopsy profiling from early pediatric AD showed significant Th2 and Th17/Th22-skewing, without the characteristic adult Th1 up-regulation. Because obtaining pediatric biopsies is difficult, blood gene expression profiling may provide a surrogate for the pediatric skin signature.


OBJECTIVE
To define the blood profile and associated biomarkers of early moderate-to-severe pediatric AD.


METHODS
We compared microarrays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of blood cells from 28 AD children (<5 years and within 6 months of disease onset) to healthy control blood cells. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in blood (fold change [FCH] > 1.2 and false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) were then compared with skin DEGs.


RESULTS
Eosinophil and Th2 markers (IL5RA, IL1RL1/ST2, HRH4, CCR3, SIGLEC8, PRSS33, CLC from gene arrays; IL13/IL4/CCL22 from RT-PCR) were up-regulated in early pediatric AD blood, whereas IFNG/Th1 was decreased. Th1 markers were negatively correlated with clinical severity (EASI, pruritus, transepidermal water loss [TEWL]), whereas Th2/Th17-induced interleukin (IL)-19 was positively correlated with SCORAD. Although a few RT-PCR-defined immune markers (IL-13/CCL22) were increased in blood, as previously also reported for skin, minimal overlap based on gene array DEGs was seen.


CONCLUSION
The whole blood signature of early moderate-to-severe pediatric AD blood cells show predominantly a Th2/eosinophil profile; however, markers largely differ from the skin profile. Given their complementarity, pooling of biomarkers from blood and skin may improve profiling and predictions, providing insight regarding disease course, allergic comorbidity development, and response to systemic medications.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""P M Brunner"", ids = ""114352963""); list(name = ""Ariel Israel"", ids = ""35881118""); list(name = ""Alexandra Leonard"", ids = ""35696781""); list(name = ""Ana BrÃ¢ndusa Pavel"", ids = ""32913144""); list(name = ""Hyun Je Kim"", ids = ""6691757""); list(name = ""Ning Zhang"", ids = ""144465142""); list(name = ""Tali Czarnowicki"", ids = ""6355918""); list(name = ""Krishna Patel"", ids = ""49540260""); list(name = ""Morgan Murphrey"", ids = ""40917346""); list(name = ""Kara Ramsey"", ids = ""5896965""); list(name = ""Stephanie M.

cd69a231e094afda74948cb244292939396ff321,Multiplex proteomics identifies novel CSF and plasma biomarkers of early Alzheimerâ€™s disease,"To date, the development of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) has largely focused on the removal of amyloid beta AÎ² fragments from the CNS. Proteomic profiling of patient fluids may help identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers associated with AD pathology. Here, we applied the Olinkâ„¢ ProSeek immunoassay to measure 270 CSF and plasma proteins across 415 AÎ²- negative cognitively normal individuals (AÎ²- CN), 142 AÎ²-positive CN (AÎ²+â€‰CN), 50 AÎ²- mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 75 AÎ²+â€‰MCI patients, and 161 AÎ²+â€‰AD patients from the Swedish BioFINDER study. A validation cohort included 59 AÎ²- CN, 23 AÎ²-â€‰+â€‰CN, 44 AÎ²- MCI and 53 AÎ²+â€‰MCI. To compare protein concentrations in patients versus controls, we applied multiple linear regressions adjusting for age, gender, medications, smoking and mean subject-level protein concentration, and corrected findings for false discovery rate (FDR, qâ€‰<â€‰0.05). We identified, and replicated, altered levels of ten CSF proteins in AÎ²+â€‰individuals, including CHIT1, SMOC2, MMP-10, LDLR, CD200, EIF4EBP1, ALCAM, RGMB, tPA and STAMBP (âˆ’â€‰0.14â€‰<â€‰dâ€‰<â€‰1.16; qâ€‰<â€‰0.05). We also identified and replicated alterations of six plasma proteins in AÎ²+ individuals OSM, MMP-9, HAGH, CD200, AXIN1, and uPA (âˆ’â€‰0.77â€‰<â€‰dâ€‰<â€‰1.28; qâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Multiple analytes associated with cognitive performance and cortical thickness (qâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Plasma biomarkers could distinguish AD dementia (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.94, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.87â€“0.98) and prodromal AD (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.78, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.68â€“0.87) from CN. These findings reemphasize the contributions of immune markers, phospholipids, angiogenic proteins and other biomarkers downstream of, and potentially orthogonal to, AÎ²- and tau in AD, and identify candidate biomarkers for earlier detection of neurodegeneration.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher D.

3998ea3aa54dbfe2a72150739bb4943c54f2f5f0,Optimizing design of two-stage experiments for transcriptional profiling,"Gene expression microarrays are powerful tools for simultaneously screening the transcriptional profile for thousands of genes across different treatments. Despite their continually improving sensitivity and dynamic range, microarrays are commonly regarded as a first screening step, with a level of precision often deemed unacceptable to use as a standalone technology. This limitation has prompted genomics researchers to validate a statistically significant subset of their microarray results using a second technique, typically quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The problem of optimizing such two-stage transcriptional profiling experiments in order to maximize sensitivity, while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), is addressed. This optimization is based on partitioning the set of available biological replicates into two groups, one for each of the microarray (Stage 1) and qRT-PCR (Stage 2) experiments. It is demonstrated how the significance level should be determined for Stage 2, after selecting a fixed percentage of the genes to validate from Stage 1, in order to maximize the sensitivity of detection of differentially expressed genes for a desired overall FDR. The results indicate that most of the available replicates (typically >60%) should be consumed in Stage 1. Even though the optimization scheme assumes independent genes and known variances, simulation results show that this approach is robust to moderate departures from those assumptions. A procedure to optimize a validation experiment, conditional upon an existing microarray assay that was not optimized for two-stage testing, is also introduced. The results indicate that generally liberal significance levels (i.e., alpha > 0.05) could be used for gene-specific Stage 2 tests in typical studies to properly control FDR.",2009,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Juan P.

13fab70764ac7f8ae2d01679d9b74269185769f8,Cardiovascular Disease-Related Serum Proteins in Workers Occupationally Exposed to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons,"Chimney sweeps have higher incidence and mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD), likely related to their exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In order to identify underlying mechanisms of PAH-related CVD, we here investigated whether PAH exposure was associated with levels of putative CVD-related proteins in serum among currently working chimney sweeps. We enrolled 116 chimney sweeps and 125 unexposed controls, all non-smoking male workers from Sweden. We measured monohydroxylated PAH metabolites in urine by LC-MS/MS and a panel of 85 proteins in serum using proximity extension assay. Linear regression analysis adjusted for age and BMI showed that 25 proteins were differentially expressed between chimney sweeps and the controls (P<0.05, adjusted for false discovery rate FDR). Of the 25 proteins, follistatin (FS), pro-interleukin-16 (IL-16), and heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP 27) showed positive associations with the monohydroxylated metabolites of PAH in a dose-response manner (P<0.05). Pathway and gene ontology analyses demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in inflammatory response and immunological functions, such as leukocyte migration, cell movement of leukocytes, and adhesion of immune cells. In conclusion, we found a number of putative CVD-related proteins differentially expressed, between PAH-exposed and unexposed individuals, and mainly involved in inflammation and immune function. Our data warrant protective measures to reduce PAH exposure and longitudinal investigations of the protein profile in chimney sweeps and other occupational groups exposed to PAH.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Ayman Alhamdow"", ids = ""3681894""); list(name = ""Christian H Lindh"", ids = ""1851019""); list(name = ""Maria Albin"", ids = ""144062489""); list(name = ""Per Gustavsson"", ids = ""34756651""); list(name = ""HÃ¥kan Tinnerberg"", ids = ""4583138""); list(name = ""Karin Broberg"", ids = ""46372046"")",,ceedc4e208ca9635b1add80ab55f8debc63a4511; 6b68ae5e0bfdee0d59dd729783a70e3398cdbbcd; 847edeef258a9267be51cb293d8a1fe5fbdea831; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; bc2a9c2d75e4ea873c25f1cdf11051fa7a846cc7; dc1c0a55493e747e3b59857f6a8056910318c0df; b1e8803302241239af7eea3d71608ee72e7595f1; 403d8517fcee70948779e0661c264f74af4b5b74; b5b595f0825a55ebf5ea98357da31c61cf6e9236; d5c3b7ee610ab629cf495ee2405a2457386aacb6; 7d241b3b769a2ac9ac7d1df01b5f2bf7ec5d4e8f; fba16c01c3b28edc9d0d046143da0675e029f4d3; 32570f47763fc9dea1fdc3d74288d189b27a7688; 7b11cad4242d9017640372f03a493772c4d408f8; 41651d61c98504684645fd9110a70c3a013b86aa; 5ca628df34b126104a6fd1d018209f3bc1a0d58c; 71964d5c7e7d89b5edce4b6874fa9a80a843bc9b; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e78b3ce3f75c1dfa8a1a749d583377c841a7dd8f; 55fe00631b806277f43c7547acad1961453872ed; e40e556e43674399459f1c42afb216afb6068317; a233cda42c1d867af55ee6fce51d2e1b731cbfb5; 6061de6307501de81e92ff28b51ab9b1f2ac1049; 4bb2fdd8040944e6ac657a85843dae3c70e5bee7; 1667d0edcb846d8662bf3bd86af1574113031b42; 3e7d7ef259490a33a3eac8d185f6df70c19461d1; b237921141456c89021750644e52eeac31661aa2; 0273ce30744f22235b30cc76bdf9df43ff3be9d8; 0a6322d767af08fe9b66b40477c1b233f4803271; 548231253b97aa4f9b84845a248c3cf401747c3f; f142a841ce3066dc0ff4a58b66be6c6e1c9c98d5; 857c7175bb78ff7357def46e005b4966d6658b88; c8722d562a01a1680d62ebe3ce7763e49fb9a6e2; e33ed47a408cb66e6c68e7fb18dd635db503ce22; b09ed5db7bdff80e6c60dd7a462ed130d3c0508b; f7346950ec056b728e999330dde24aad440a269e; 71fee86dab257b7828e54cebbdd06153e5877e49; cc27bd188bd0dc8b5ba4a3823a0a4ae3057b049f; 14960a0a47f5d2c308db8d3596c2efd079b0d2ac; 766fa8e0772ef1c5396e72adcc090c086dedb70c; d6a936217db3e907c095477769bfb216db73d121; 08b64f2a870acd5dcd632b1361f94389207e3ddb; 4cdd487076f8932ed369db489c4b7b0afd616078; 83895c115f21c164e56fd10750184085e597348c; 55dddf70f4b737f88e08afaadcc968f9859dc98a; e895ad10ce2ec371ad8738fdcf6edc5f41f559f2; 3dbb8c571998f9da1e6e8de6381c2ef474445d24; d710ffac78c85f41583582131c2fc4364f070e32; b3ea960e01ee8907971a7bde469ca4e03e9303c1; d641f13c61043c1998e57ad9072f5646c07cf505; 00aaa2d8dc47921eca3854c03fa7133c24452909; 45bb4477ed0bd0d5ec6174786991e5734ab85e21; bd9851f5b7857fee03f77bf10ca33d22aadd37f8; e7c48fb6049521a9511375de1b405b7e5b38e6e6; eb64ea97f672f5a787d8c06ee928d7b76e63ad94; 2fd4602ef32846005a6642dc342b13dbe807cf5d; 2b15c487e6eb96394a50446f461489fa0ec2e632; c5962b3281a515a7aac2ccfa22cb42a8bdea29de; bc6e8aad34d351e6d017b8278d6b53e625f26934; fb0370cd37e66e097960fba7604bbbd0a12a0439; 9cdea027b828de525c876ede01988ea09d0ebab7; 9c95d566eff69e39ff9315d6f7226f6c022ecad5; 2d4ee246b75b03635fa580179618b1635821ea96; feca1b343a6b8fac64a8e8f0e9ab0180d9c66f6b; 184546e3e83e492d1073280dad664eede60feb71,Toxicological Sciences,171,235 - 246
2fc25142ca331479b6f35987e6044e5a8c9bcdff,Association of Untargeted Urinary Metabolomics and Lung Cancer Risk Among Never-Smoking Women in China,"Importance
Chinese women have the highest rate of lung cancer among female never-smokers in the world, and the etiology is poorly understood.


Objective
To assess the association between metabolomics and lung cancer risk among never-smoking women.


Design, Setting, and Participants
This nested case-control study included 275 never-smoking female patients with lung cancer and 289 never-smoking cancer-free control participants from the prospective Shanghai Women's Health Study recruited from December 28, 1996, to May 23, 2000. Validated food frequency questionnaires were used for the collection of dietary information. Metabolomic analysis was conducted from November 13, 2015, to January 6, 2016. Data analysis was conducted from January 6, 2016, to November 29, 2018.


Exposures
Untargeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic profiles were characterized using prediagnosis urine samples. A total of 39â€¯416 metabolites were measured.


Main Outcomes and Measures
Incident lung cancer.


Results
Among the 564 women, those who developed lung cancer (275 participants; median [interquartile range] age, 61.0 [52-65] years) and those who did not develop lung cancer (289 participants; median [interquartile range] age, 62.0 [53-66] years) at follow-up (median [interquartile range] follow-up, 10.9 [9.0-11.7] years) were similar in terms of their secondhand smoke exposure, history of respiratory diseases, and body mass index. A peak metabolite, identified as 5-methyl-2-furoic acid, was significantly associated with lower lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72]; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001; false discovery rateâ€‰=â€‰0.039). Furthermore, this peak was weakly correlated with self-reported dietary soy intake (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.21; Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). Increasing tertiles of this metabolite were associated with lower lung cancer risk (in comparison with first tertile, odds ratio for second tertile, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34-0.80]; and odds ratio for third tertile, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.30-0.70]), and the association was consistent across different histological subtypes and follow-up times. Additionally, metabolic pathway analysis found several systemic biological alterations that were associated with lung cancer risk, including 1-carbon metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation.


Conclusions and Relevance
This prospective study of the untargeted urinary metabolome and lung cancer among never-smoking women in China provides support for the hypothesis that soy-based metabolites are associated with lower lung cancer risk in never-smoking women and suggests that biological processes linked to air pollution may be associated with higher lung cancer risk in this population.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Lun Seow"", ids = ""7329113""); list(name = ""Xiao-Ou Shu"", ids = ""2363552""); list(name = ""Jeremy K.

c1f7a56304f06e77b006a93ef22a2da8c2b9ecac,Baseline predictors of visual acuity and retinal thickness outcomes in patients with retinal vein occlusion: Standard Care Versus COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion Study report 10.,"OBJECTIVE
To investigate baseline factors associated with visual acuity and central retinal thickness outcomes in patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion in the Standard Care versus COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study.


DESIGN
Two multicenter, randomized clinical trials: one evaluating participants with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and one evaluating participants with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).


PARTICIPANTS
Participants with follow-up data of 1 year or more, including 238 with CRVO and 367 with BRVO.


METHODS
Visual acuity was measured by the electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) method, and central retinal thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Regression analysis related these outcomes to 20 baseline measures. Multiple P values were adjusted to control the false discovery rate.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Outcome measures of visual acuity letter score included absolute change from baseline, a gain of â‰¥ 15 from baseline, and a loss of â‰¥ 15 from baseline. Outcome measures of center point thickness included absolute change from baseline, a measurement of â‰¤ 250 Î¼m, and a measurement of â‰¥ 500 Î¼m. Outcomes were assessed at 1 and 2 years.


RESULTS
For CRVO and BRVO, younger age was associated with improved visual acuity and central retinal thickness outcomes. For CRVO, triamcinolone treatment and less severe anatomic abnormalities of the retina (center point thickness and areas of retinal hemorrhage, thickening, and fluorescein leakage) were predictive of better visual acuity outcomes. For BRVO, no history of coronary artery disease was predictive of improved visual acuity outcomes. For center point thickness outcomes, shorter duration of macular edema was associated with improvement in both disease entities. For CRVO, higher baseline visual acuity letter score was predictive of favorable OCT outcomes. For BRVO, lower baseline visual acuity letter score, presence of dense macular hemorrhage, and no prior grid photocoagulation were predictive of favorable OCT outcomes.


CONCLUSIONS
Several factors were predictive of better visual acuity outcomes and more favorable OCT outcomes, including younger age and shorter duration of macular edema, respectively. These factors may assist clinicians in predicting disease course for patients with CRVO and BRVO.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ingrid U.

fde65430563b519a2e875a60c1ba9c918f093ef5,Su1: Exploring Genetic Variation That Influences Brain Methylation in Attention-deficit/hyperactivity Disorder (adhd),"Background Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) is a common epigenetic mechanism that involves SNPs correlating with differential levels of methylation at CpG sites. Epigenetic changes play a crucial role in driving lasting changes in gene expression in several tissues, including the brain. As alteration of DNA methylation levels has recently been linked to ADHD symptoms, our aim is to explore the contribution of ASM to ADHD through a case-control association study using different GWAS datasets. Methods We performed a primary SNP selection based on two previous studies that identified ASM variants in different brain regions of post-mortem human samples. Subsequently, from those variants we selected a total of 3,896 SNPs following these criteria: associations in cis between the SNP and methylation at a CpG site, correlation of methylation levels with gene expression (R2) â‰¥ 0.2, tagSNPs for each CpG site (LD; r2â‰¥0.85). These candidates were inspected in summary statistics data from the first GWAS meta-analysis of adult and childhood ADHD, performed by iPSYCH and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) in 20,183 cases and 35,191 controls. We applied False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing (5% FDR, corrected Pâ‰¤ 6.78e-05) to determine the top hits. These signals were followed-up to retrieve (i) SNPs located within the same CpG site and thereafter (ii) SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with the associated SNPs (using the same FDR threshold). Impact of the variants on gene expression levels were further explored in the GTEx database. Results The case-control association study identified eight tagSNPs surviving FDR, which correlate with differential methylation of six CpG sites. Top hits were followed-up to retrieve other SNPs that correlate with methylation of the same CpG sites, making a total of 39 candidate SNPs. The six CpG sites are located in the promoter regions of five genes, not previously related to ADHD. Notably, the risk SNPs associated with three of the genes are eQTLs for those genes in various brain tissues, including the cerebellar hemisphere and the cerebellum. Discussion We have directed existing knowledge of ASM to evaluate its possible contribution to ADHD both at genetic and epigenetic levels. We followed a systematic approach by employing cis-acting ASM variants to pinpoint candidate genes for ADHD. Interestingly, several of the identified variants are eQTLs for genes that are expressed in brain. Our aim is now to further investigate the role of these genes in the development of the ADHD phenotype.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Laura Pineda-Cirera"", ids = ""1404646563""); list(name = ""Anu Shivalikanjli"", ids = ""88728443""); list(name = ""Judit Cabana-DomÃ­nguez"", ids = ""1401669501""); list(name = ""The Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psy Research"", ids = ""88729161""); list(name = ""NoÃ¨lia FernÃ ndez-Castillo"", ids = ""1400816041"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,29,s886-s887
7cb25cafabc1f59398256ac8613c6e29ac2ec33b,Systematic modular approaches to reveal DNA damage responses in mammalian cells.,"Accumulation of damage in undifferentiated cells may threaten homeostasis and regenerative capacity. Remarkably, p53 has been suggested to be transcriptionally inactive in these cells. To gain insight in the kinetics and interplay of the predominant transcriptional responses of DNA damage signalling pathways in undifferentiated cells, mouse embryonic stem cells were exposed to cisplatin at four different time points (2, 4, 8 and 24 h) and concentrations (1, 2, 5 and 10 Î¼M). RNA was isolated and subjected to genome-wide expression profiling. Up to one fourth of the tested genes could be identified as being differentially expressed (false discovery rate = 10%) after the cisplatin treatment. Clustering of the expression changes showed a strong time dependency. To investigate the relationship between affected genes, a gene set analysis method was used. Functionally related gene sets were defined using gene ontologies or transcription factor binding sites and were tested for overrepresentation within the differentially expressed genes. A variety of gene sets were clearly enriched among which 'apoptosis' and 'cell cycle' were the most pronounced. Furthermore, there was a strong enrichment of genes with a p53-binding motif. The involvement of the 'cell cycle' and 'apoptosis' gene sets in the cisplatin response was detected at concentrations and time points where the respective biological assays were still negative. The results reveal novel insights into the mechanisms which maintain the genomic integrity in undifferentiated cells. Additionally the results illustrate that gene set analysis of genome-wide expression changes provides a sensitive instrument to detect cellular stress responses to DNA damage.",2006,Biology,"list(name = ""Svensson Jp"", ids = ""88064491"")",,59049703956603749f9c96dc73a772944f303fc3;

3ad2fcded5f3b2550f518b52288630a2750fc6e5,An eQTL analysis of the human glioblastoma multiforme genome.,"In this paper we use eQTL mapping to identify associations between gene dysregulation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). A set of 532,954 SNPs was evaluated as predictors of the expression levels of 22,279 expression probes. We identified SNPs associated with fold change in expression level rather than raw expression levels in the tumor. Following adjustment for false discovery rate, the complete set of probes yielded 9257 significant associations (p<0.05). We found 18 eQTLs that were missense mutations. Many of the eQTLs in the non-coding regions of a gene, or linked to nearby genes, had large numbers of significant associations (e.g. 321 for RNASE3, 101 for BNC2). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the expression probes in significant associations were involved in signal transduction, transcription regulation, membrane function, and cell cycle regulation. These results suggest several loci that may serve as hubs in gene regulatory pathways associated with GBM.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Max Shpak"", ids = ""145923292""); list(name = ""Amelia Weber Hall"", ids = ""5053958""); list(name = ""Marcus M Goldberg"", ids = ""35472662""); list(name = ""Dakota Z.

25321a4d1aba37e87d02a69ed3632608e1c38ff3,Transcriptome of Chicken Liver Tissues Reveals the Candidate Genes and Pathways Responsible for Adaptation into Two Different Climatic Conditions,"RNA sequencing was used to profile the liver transcriptome of a Korean commercial chicken (Hanhyup) at two different environments (Korea and Kyrgyzstan) to investigate their role during acclimatization into different climatic conditions. Ten samples from each location were analyzed to identify candidate genes that respond to environmental changes such as altitude, humidity, temperature, etc. Sequencing reads were preprocessed, aligned with the reference genome, assembled and expressions were estimated through bioinformatics approaches. At a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and fold change (FC) â‰¥2, we found 315 genes were DE. Out of 315 DE genes, 174 and 141 were up- and down-regulated respectively in the Kyrgyz environment. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with energy metabolism such as pyruvate and lactate metabolic processes, and glycerol catabolic process. Similarly, KEGG pathway analysis indicated pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, biosynthesis, citrate cycles were differentially enriched in the Kyrgyz environment. DEGs like TSKU, VTG1, SGK, CDK2, etc. in such pathways are highly involved in the adaptation of organisms into diverse climatic conditions. Our investigation may serve as a resource for the chicken industry, especially in exporting Hanhyup chicken from Korea to other countries.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Himansu Kumar"", ids = ""38144670""); list(name = ""Asankadyr U.

b1d67d07229106bd50b130fd6b03f9ca16404250,Nutrient-wide association study of 92 foods and nutrients and breast cancer risk,"BackgroundSeveral dietary factors have been reported to be associated with risk of breast cancer, but to date, unequivocal evidence only exists for alcohol consumption. We sought to systematically assess the association between intake of 92 foods and nutrients and breast cancer risk using a nutrient-wide association study.MethodsUsing data from 272,098 women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, we assessed dietary intake of 92 foods and nutrients estimated by dietary questionnaires. Cox regression was used to quantify the association between each food/nutrient and risk of breast cancer. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 was used to select the set of foods and nutrients to be replicated in the independent Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS).ResultsSix foods and nutrients were identified as associated with risk of breast cancer in the EPIC study (10,979 cases). Higher intake of alcohol overall was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio (HR) for a 1 SD increment in intakeâ€‰=â€‰1.05, 95% CI 1.03â€“1.07), as was beer/cider intake and wine intake (HRs per 1 SD incrementâ€‰=â€‰1.05, 95% CI 1.03â€“1.06 and 1.04, 95% CI 1.02â€“1.06, respectively), whereas higher intakes of fibre, apple/pear, and carbohydrates were associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (HRs per 1 SD incrementâ€‰=â€‰0.96, 95% CI 0.94â€“0.98; 0.96, 95% CI 0.94â€“0.99; and 0.96, 95% CI 0.95â€“0.98, respectively). When evaluated in the NLCS (2368 cases), estimates for each of these foods and nutrients were similar in magnitude and direction, with the exception of beer/cider intake, which was not associated with risk in the NLCS.ConclusionsOur findings confirm a positive association of alcohol consumption and suggest an inverse association of dietary fibre and possibly fruit intake with breast cancer risk.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Alicia K.

99674920dcfb9ef5ca3aebd1ecb8a7ffc481ab16,Genome-Wide Scan Informed by Age-Related Disease Identifies Loci for Exceptional Human Longevity,"We developed a new statistical framework to find genetic variants associated with extreme longevity. The method, informed GWAS (iGWAS), takes advantage of knowledge from large studies of age-related disease in order to narrow the search for SNPs associated with longevity. To gain support for our approach, we first show there is an overlap between loci involved in disease and loci associated with extreme longevity. These results indicate that several disease variants may be depleted in centenarians versus the general population. Next, we used iGWAS to harness information from 14 meta-analyses of disease and trait GWAS to identify longevity loci in two studies of long-lived humans. In a standard GWAS analysis, only one locus in these studies is significant (APOE/TOMM40) when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 10%. With iGWAS, we identify eight genetic loci to associate significantly with exceptional human longevity at FDR < 10%. We followed up the eight lead SNPs in independent cohorts, and found replication evidence of four loci and suggestive evidence for one more with exceptional longevity. The loci that replicated (FDR < 5%) included APOE/TOMM40 (associated with Alzheimer's disease), CDKN2B/ANRIL (implicated in the regulation of cellular senescence), ABO (tags the O blood group), and SH2B3/ATXN2 (a signaling gene that extends lifespan in Drosophila and a gene involved in neurological disease). Our results implicate new loci in longevity and reveal a genetic overlap between longevity and age-related diseases and traits, including coronary artery disease and Alzheimer's disease. iGWAS provides a new analytical strategy for uncovering SNPs that influence extreme longevity, and can be applied more broadly to boost power in other studies of complex phenotypes.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kristen Fortney"", ids = ""2995868""); list(name = ""Edgar Dobriban"", ids = ""2694895""); list(name = ""Paolo Garagnani"", ids = ""3377953""); list(name = ""Chiara Pirazzini"", ids = ""3410808""); list(name = ""Daniela Monti"", ids = ""49212436""); list(name = ""Daniela Mari"", ids = ""144895084""); list(name = ""Gil Atzmon"", ids = ""3102718""); list(name = ""Nir Barzilai"", ids = ""2483722""); list(name = ""Claudio Franceschi"", ids = ""144314191""); list(name = ""Art B.

640ded06563b12f5cce4c9f7e2c49dfb2a5a930b,ADHD symptoms and their neurodevelopmental correlates in children born very preterm,"This study investigated the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology in preschool-aged children who were born very preterm (<33 weeks) and cognitive outcomes, clinical risk and socio-demographic characteristics. 119 very preterm children who participated in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging Study at term-equivalent age were assessed at a mean age of 4.5 years. Parents completed the ADHD Rating Scale IV, a norm-referenced checklist that evaluates ADHD symptomatology according to diagnostic criteria, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version. Children completed the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence and the Forward Digit Span task. Longitudinal data including perinatal clinical, qualitative MRI classification, socio-demographic variables and neurodevelopmental disabilities were investigated in relation to ADHD symptomatology. All results were corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate. Results showed that although the proportion of very preterm children with clinically significant ADHD did not differ from normative data after excluding those with neurodevelopmental disabilities, 32.7% met criteria for subthreshold ADHD inattentive type and 33.6% for combined type, which was higher than the expected 20% in normative samples. Higher ADHD symptom scores (all) were associated with greater executive dysfunction (inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition, corrected p<0.001 for all tests). Higher inattentive ADHD symptom scores were associated with lower IQ (Ï = -0.245, p = 0.011) and higher perinatal clinical risk (more days on mechanical ventilation (Ï = 0.196, p = 0.032) and more days on parenteral nutrition (Ï = 0.222, p = 0.015). Higher hyperactive ADHD symptom scores instead were associated with lower socio-economic status (Ï = 0.259, p = 0.004). These results highlight the importance of monitoring and supporting the development of very preterm children throughout the school years, as subthreshold ADHD symptoms represent risk factors for psychosocial problems and for receiving a future clinical diagnosis of ADHD.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Anita Montagna"", ids = ""40462026""); list(name = ""Vyacheslav Karolis"", ids = ""3407971""); list(name = ""Dafnis Batalle"", ids = ""46413738""); list(name = ""Serena J.

079c9134e53f6bea6747e38e4721362d05d62cfb,Private False Discovery Rate Control,"We provide the first differentially private algorithms for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing, with essentially no loss in power under certain conditions. Our general approach is to adapt a well-known variant of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BHq), making each step differentially private. This destroys the classical proof of FDR control. To prove FDR control of our method, (a) we develop a new proof of the original (non-private) BHq algorithm and its robust variants -- a proof requiring only the assumption that the true null test statistics are independent, allowing for arbitrary correlations between the true nulls and false nulls. This assumption is fairly weak compared to those previously shown in the vast literature on this topic, and explains in part the empirical robustness of BHq. Then (b) we relate the FDR control properties of the differentially private version to the control properties of the non-private version. \end{enumerate} We also present a low-distortion ""one-shot"" differentially private primitive for ""top $k$"" problems, e.g., ""Which are the $k$ most popular hobbies?"" (which we apply to: ""Which hypotheses have the $k$ most significant $p$-values?""), and use it to get a faster privacy-preserving instantiation of our general approach at little cost in accuracy. The proof of privacy for the one-shot top~$k$ algorithm introduces a new technique of independent interest.",2015,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Cynthia Dwork"", ids = ""1781565""); list(name = ""Weijie Su"", ids = ""145499378""); list(name = ""Li Zhang"", ids = ""40062432"")",a9d996946fed6706b7fd1c32da44ab6ee0a2e5bd; 08217ecf2c8f5b03eeda57d34203203336373490; 0346afcb20e42d649007e7ce4630e1b069dec719; aadb68f0e87801ce3845f3f2a0f4eb9c401847df; 3b2e7ec73d5ea4fd023e3a775cc0d2acda33e040; 4b796df56c0f5bfac20df5c9fd45e9b062e07817; a209f89b3b2b1e62818e29e7f82bd5e31e189a3f; c88bd97a4378f22add13b4c1556cd3878eeab5c0; 644bc7496cd3fbb97e705a0e77e4b97b85f0fab1; 58164190c4d3f8d3a9ab226966a5d7ed766e181d; 189276808f882badea406dec57bbfbc20b84f01a; 2362552628c5755745c16a421a5e79acee4de702; 897cfd9b46c65d95147f94d26d3626fe098d9b3c; 85a155a60bcd121cc3f195e86da75b215296a116; 116c256d6898e1c43542e306a2520773683e3c6d; 8b06790cae439c734cc0ee7c4583bf65a4c07953; 9e2af3a83836f5817e7bad8edd27b881a707313d,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c91a14f5a1f3d588c08e9db47093da3cf1c0a493; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; 463c6dc4feb8504ce4e1abc9a5db235ae22b9fa6; 1808b64aec21863489f0fe66f250890a3ac2b843; aaaae6628c9c33e165e5cd5538b27d9275c24347; 0023582fde36430c7e3ae81611a14e558c8f4bae; e4ce10063cd25447dcde75c2d9ce327446ced952; edf27bb5272ea6fe244deb3bbc8da0429bfe3ac5; 33eebf77fc733dd0f8053c449d52bb17319539ee; 0e2441103746d899fdb545d118771c711cda0dd7; 1aacd77be39403ca1dbabc050ce89bea3162a00c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f8558a09553fc35415b271019be9f7d44354073e; f169d03d8db5b10c995deb1df016d8b2e201f61a,ArXiv,abs/1511.03803,

Modern strains of meat birds can reach live weights of 2Â kg in 35 d, while layer strains are now capable of producing more than 300 eggs per annum but grow slowly. In this study, RNA-Seq was used to investigate hepatic gene expression between three groups of birds with large differences in growth potential; meat bird, layer strain as well as an F1 layer x meat bird. The objective was to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes between all three strains to elucidate biological factors underpinning variations in growth performance.ResultsRNA-Seq analysis was carried out on total RNA extracted from the liver of meat bird (nÂ =â€‰6), F1 layer x meat bird cross (nÂ =â€‰6) and layer strain (nÂ =â€‰6), males. Differential expression of genes were considered significant at PÂ <â€‰0.05, and a false discovery rate of <â€‰0.05, with any fold change considered. In total, 6278 genes were found to be DE with 5832 DE between meat birds and layers (19%), 2935 DE between meat birds and the cross (9.6%) and 493 DE between the cross and layers (1.6%). Comparisons between the three groups identified 155 significant DE genes. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the 155 DE genes showed the FoxO signalling pathway was most enriched (PÂ =â€‰0.001), including genes related to cell cycle regulation and insulin signalling. Significant GO terms included â€˜positive regulation of glucose importâ€™ and â€˜cellular response to oxidative stressâ€™, which is also consistent with FoxOs regulation of glucose metabolism. There were high correlations between FoxO pathway genes and bodyweight, as well as genes related to glycolysis and bodyweight.ConclusionsThis study revealed large transcriptome differences between meat and layer birds. There was significant evidence implicating the FoxO signalling pathway (via cell cycle regulation and altered metabolism) as an active driver of growth variations in chicken.

04e293d5dbf088c7bcf35b29fa1a6cb87ba012e6,Global Plasma Profiling for Colorectal Cancer-Associated Volatile Organic Compounds: a Proof-of-Principle Study.,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) could reflect changes resulting from ongoing pathophysiological processes and altered body metabolisms, and thus have been studied for various types of cancers. We aimed to test an advanced global metabolomic technique to characterize circulating VOCs in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC). We employed solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC Ã— GC-MS). We analyzed 30 random plasma samples from incident cases of CRC. The 30 samples were from population controls enrolled in a large population-based case-control study. The number of metabolite peaks detected in the cases was significantly lower than that detected in the controls (median 1530 vs. 1694, P = 0.02). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed clear VOC profile differences between the CRC and the controls. After adjustment for multiple comparisons at the 5% false discovery rate level, five VOCs were differentially expressed between the cases and the controls. Among these five VOCs, 2,3,4-trimethyl-hexane (decreased) and 2,4-dimethylhept-1-ene (increased) were both lipid peroxidation products but not previously reported for CRC. In summary, this study pointed to an intriguing observation that the richness of volatile metabolites may be reduced in CRC cases and demonstrated the utility of SPME GC Ã— GC-MS in discovery of candidate markers for further validation.",2019,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Seongho Kim"", ids = ""2021528""); list(name = ""Xinmin Yin"", ids = ""34388467""); list(name = ""Md Aminul Islam Prodhan"", ids = ""35687234""); list(name = ""Xiang Zhang"", ids = ""1686870""); list(name = ""Zichun Zhong"", ids = ""34774354""); list(name = ""Ikuko Kato"", ids = ""4507566"")",,,Journal of chromatographic science,57 5,"

f598acf429e2d64a3fbfdb0c4837451ccda982ab,Viral Tropism in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1-Infected Children and Adolescents in Thailand.,"BACKGROUND
Maraviroc, a C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist, has been used as an alternative antiretroviral drug in treatment-experienced adults and children infected by CCR5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. Prior to widespread use of this drug, rates of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism and factors associated with coreceptor tropism had to be determined.


METHODS
HIV-1-infected individuals agedâ€…<20 years with HIV-1 viral loadsâ€…>1000 RNA copies/mL who were treatment-experienced or treatment-naive were enrolled. HIV-1 coreceptor tropism was determined using a genotypic test in which V3 sequences were analyzed with GENO2PHENO version 2.5 and a false discovery rate of 5%.


RESULTS
Fifty-two HIV-1-infected patients were recruited. The median age of participants was 14.9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 8.9-16.8 years). The median CD4 cell count was 396.0 cells/ÂµL (IQR, 72.0-630.3 cells/ÂµL). The median HIV-1 viral load was 43 339 RNA copies/mL (IQR, 8874-197 055 copies/mL). Thirty-nine patients (75%) were treatment-experienced. The most prevalent HIV-1 subtype in this population was CRF01_AE (36 patients, 69.2%). Based on analyses of V3 loop sequences, 5 of 13 treatment-naive patients (38.5%) and 11 of 39 treatment-experienced patients (28.2%) were infected by R5 viruses, while 7 of 13 treatment-naive patients (53.8%) and 19 of 39 treatment-experienced patients (48.7%) were infected by X4 viruses. The only factor associated with the presence of X4 viruses was HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE.


CONCLUSIONS
X4-tropic viruses are associated with the CRF01_AE subtype. Hence, testing of HIV tropism should be performed before treatment with CCR5 inhibitors in children in areas where CRF01_AE predominates.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Natt Arayapong"", ids = ""66132349""); list(name = ""Ekawat Pasomsub"", ids = ""6579959""); list(name = ""Rujikorn Kanlayanadonkit"", ids = ""1490859597""); list(name = ""Jiraporn Keatkla"", ids = ""41021731""); list(name = ""Chonnamet Techasaensiri"", ids = ""50179652""); list(name = ""Angsana Phuphuakrat"", ids = ""11704362""); list(name = ""Somnuek Sungkanuparph"", ids = ""6926498""); list(name = ""Nopporn Apiwattanakul"", ids = ""6251032""); list(name = ""Sujittra Chaisavaneeyakorn"", ids = ""50175025"")",,,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,

METHODS
133 patients with stage I-III breast cancer were included. Pretreatment gene expression profiling was performed with Affymetrix U133 A chips on fine needle aspiration specimens. We developed predictors of pCR from 82 cases and assessed accuracy on 51 independent cases.


RESULTS
Overall pCR rate was 26% in both cohorts. In the training set, 56 probes (49 genes) were identified as differentially expressed between pCR versus residual disease at a false discovery rate of 1%. We examined the performance of 780 distinct classifiers (set of genes + prediction algorithm) in full cross validation. Many predictors performed equally well. A nominally best 30-probe set DLDA classifier was selected for independent validation. It showed substantially higher sensitivity (92% vs 61%), negative predictive value (96% vs 86%) and better AUC (0.877 vs 0.811) than a predictor including clinical variables (age, ER, grade). The combination of genomic and clinical information yielded the best model, AUC=0.883, sensitivity 92%, specificity 71%, PPV 52%, NPV 96%. In 31 samples, RNA was hybridized in replicate with resulting predictions that were 97% concordant.


CONCLUSION
A 30-probe set pharmacogenomic predictor alone or in combination with ER and grade predicts response to T/FAC chemotherapy with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. This test correctly identified all but one of the patients who achieved pCR (12/13) and all but one of those who had residual cancer (27/28).

582f85f0248c1496ae067cdb6cf2b6f9f134d929,The Problem of Irreproducibility,"Data currently generated in the fields of ecology, medicine, climatology, and neuroscience often contain tens of thousands of measured variables. If special care is not taken, the complexity associated with statistical analysis of such data can lead to publication of results that prove to be irreproducible. The field of modern statistics has had to revisit the classical hypothesis testing paradigm to accommodate modern high-throughput settings. A first step is correction for multiplicity in the number of possible variables selected as significant using multiple hypotheses correction to ensure false discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini, Hochberg, 1995). FDR adjustments do not solve the problem of double dipping the data, and recent work develops a field known as post-selection inference that enables inference when the same data is used both to choose and to evaluate models. It remains that the complexity of software and flexibility of choices in tuning parameters can bias the output toward inflation of significant results; neuroscientists recently revisited the problem and found that many fMRI studies have resulted in false positives. Unfortunately, all formal correction methods are tailored for specific settings and do not take into account the flexibility available to todayâ€™s statisticians. A constructive way forward is to be transparent about the analyses performed, separate the exploratory and confirmatory phases of the analyses, and provide open access code; this will result in both enhanced reproducibility and replicability.",2017,,"list(name = ""Susan Holmes"", ids = ""46339412"")",,b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4361c5c1d2e54262fc711fde732cb44e8d31afa3; 9e3242422bb604de9930ff8e45c82b9421d70c08; 55e7b22104446ca0b81b0cd9993c0d422d2d5094; 4a27761b47c79dc1cece1bf24f0de2ce93cb3262; 4d372cda12aa4d5826ac2eb3666821d2ebe4affb; bdabc13bc819f84356eaeb7b087855f5457d990d; 44d86f3ba9167f4931dae729d814c13fbc7a0efb; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 3e34e21b673057d582daa2d0dcfdcbdf336dadbd; 9228488941e8568154b61d576ff5044d08e130f7; c2bc880156c10fc8d1752cd3d528e4ef96cbaac4; 79e8b756f8cc59b4b5aaf1a7de7094f3a935803e; afa36024f3d0925e70ae31ec04dbea16e6b608e5; bcd2a1e2a53751ab3f3d312f0ec6da41a0628451; 82e54374b8e587c952d7707300c67eca9511fa17; b4ee596014935f02d5496146774d2b6caae92ba9; 869e99037469fa9caa7b62e913b689812e6767e5; a3a98b44e77d6d2aed61d390530094e25a9fe121; 68544f3f58f06ada5d3ac34ec2ea4decfc39b131; 38bd59a72cab916550e9ed7f189b5ef32a73a4e6; e578203c26f8a1e909e5d75c20bd1e16dddee03f; f545c45cdebb6e60f8fbca6efbfdf6268ff390a3; 600d99d9959578a81d611678964b7a4f8cb75730; 9585409619282ac974ba9a3c6de31cbac12b9a14; 86da80bda8b6acd361cd6f658ed39a0eb476e827; fe72a01e9f062f09bda590d9964ff4e0d6e37974; 13594c3d461984009c5464179b89637bb691e964; 9c878593318d379b8d890abdb4550dd78bfa27e2; dfa3c3689503600fe0bcc45eb0ad319e313079b9; 1b60c4fddb8ab5475bc3295a2d0af4b1167bc444; 349f97c405795f8eb858067f089dbbf48c523b4d; 778512a6b16fbafda9603ca5ce0a382bbd8dd6ee; 9c445e726cb8ca9c05312f9642c2129d8396d71b; 1ee765d218aaea7ef4d95df27043954fb7d3b4df; 5771b4774d5ed5f52a5500508887ac4b3a3f1058; 3801a467e7876d4b4d0fe26c1cba6a46f9002a66; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; b8eca2a764de63db02670bcc02cb759ced723b39; c229167b828d914b5782bfa1626bd35e8d234a58; 6fa36154f11da0aa1b5aaa4158389278d7dafbab; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; b8db0ca28c530dd0d0671af5d1a1c238a5a03fee; e9ac27fd47eb6d4c6baadf8c6515dd6d90e55085; 19778a16b4118f8840aa88f35ca1a3b99799cefc; 574753071c85f6484f049305744d669c37c6a9d4; ebd342793ee80999119cf163f5774d649fc0c928; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; c1aa3c612e323acc33348c2a706cc7a12941412e; 8e068ce32ab76d918fd48ecdab27a8481ab63975; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; 13eb77434b41b977164d59fc5f4c2907aba1f4f3; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 150d340d36b64c30c2aba69ebb1d27d9c2234687; 28ff4e0de42caa4c6dfb03a46af25c7afd42b7d9; 451f228c82b6871dfaa3287687f706cf75375213; fa3c3fb3db6d54105c7990b6fd3ef41f3aff439d; 1bc2bd69c22f7bccbb5e9729a0e24ba938bf2e29; 96ef799148b63e2f4399cb454b1dd1b0c6836c3d; b38eeec1c63fed013262fe34286042d11bb96609; 93bc678116f0a062de7f694e0552f56df924d08f; 8125d755ad1fa64b869657d0f102836908af7a09; 8a2fa093d26ac42002900ae0accfb6b7733add71; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 2b78b4cc963b81d114814d9d3e474232a3c35cd8; 60f15e3d3a8e1e0c723ec04d4b4dca13ed71c5ca; e5329825123f459d47ebf87577f8d69cfa520418; 1cb681fbb70383afb806d887b96a020503beb72a; 959e70e71e06b4277e86caceddce0c23cd8b23d6; f0d5eaf321cf39b9786c84554a4a06f2bc197981; 6410ec306cfec30aa85d2172ac9eba1ef5bea4cc; 22a872a231374563cc2aa8b13a75846222a41c74; 989d218f54f2f337599c5a6d30a06b76c90b54f5; 914ae0d35a987f60f6db4c96107c2ad83370ae8e; 16f2610e19dff8f052f7e3538983f3c539a1e554; 3e2b34eedafbd77da575724a57992121698913a4; ff3946e9298d342f9fa54e55e5dfa7ea71f18372,,,

Cushing's disease (CD) involves brain impairments caused by excessive cortisol. Whether these impairments are reversible in remitted CD after surgery has long been controversial due to a lack of high-quality longitudinal studies. In this study the authors aimed to assess the reversibility of whole-brain changes in remitted CD after transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), and its correlations with clinical and hormonal parameters, in the largest longitudinal study cohort to date for CD patient brain analysis.


METHODS
Fifty patients with pathologically diagnosed CD and 36 matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in a tertiary comprehensive hospital and national pituitary disease registry center in China. 3-T MRI studies were analyzed using an artificial intelligence-assisted web-based autosegmentation tool to quantify 3D brain volumes. Clinical parameters as well as levels of serum cortisol, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and 24-hour urinary free cortisol were collected for the correlation analysis. All CD patients underwent TSS and 46 patients achieved remission. All clinical, hormonal, and MRI parameters were reevaluated at the 3-month follow-up after surgery.


RESULTS
Widespread brain volume loss was observed in active CD patients compared with HCs, including total gray matter (p = 0.003, with false discovery rate [FDR] correction) and the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes; insula; cingulate lobe; and enlargement of lateral and third ventricles (p < 0.05, corrected with FDR). All affected brain regions improved significantly after TSS (p < 0.05, corrected with FDR). In patients with remitted CD, total gray matter and most brain regions (except the frontal and temporal lobes) showed full recovery of volume, with volumes that did not differ from those of HCs (p > 0.05, corrected with FDR). ACTH and serum cortisol changes were negatively correlated with brain volume changes during recovery (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the rapid reversal of total gray matter loss in remitted CD. The combination of full recovery areas and partial recovery areas after TSS is consistent with the incomplete recovery of memory and cognitive function observed in CD patients in clinical practice. Correlation analyses suggest that ACTH and serum cortisol levels are reliable serum biomarkers of brain recovery for clinical use after surgery.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bo Hou"", ids = ""1475562911""); list(name = ""Lu Gao"", ids = ""145173796""); list(name = ""Lin Shi"", ids = ""144039420""); list(name = ""Yishan Luo"", ids = ""10219698""); list(name = ""Xiaopeng Guo"", ids = ""3078325""); list(name = ""G S Young"", ids = ""145398412""); list(name = ""Lei Qin"", ids = ""47657618""); list(name = ""Huijuan Zhu"", ids = ""37470970""); list(name = ""Lin Lu"", ids = ""50706867""); list(name = ""Zihao Wang"", ids = ""48708425""); list(name = ""Ming Feng"", ids = ""119610006""); list(name = ""Xinjie Bao"", ids = ""8537973""); list(name = ""Renzhi Wang"", ids = ""3240528""); list(name = ""Bing Xing"", ids = ""143605359""); list(name = ""Feng Feng"", ids = ""145948947"")",fb8b8bc77c83aeb02a8fc3f101803870b4298ac2,,Journal of neurosurgery,,"

962c5f8bbb07ee8586633ab7a61b3eb1c93360c2,Methylated CpGs in early life predict lung function in subsequent periods,"Background: Lung function is the key clinical marker for asthma; it may be influenced by the epigenetic mechanisms e.g. DNA methylation (DNA-M). However, no study has shown the role of DNA-M to predict lung function. Objectives: To explore whether the specific methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) across the epigenome at early life can predict the lung functions in later periods. Methods: The Isle of Wight birth cohort was established in 1989. The current analysis focuses on girls. DNA-M levels were measured from peripheral blood spots and samples collected from neonates ( n =30) and at age 10 ( n =34), using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Spirometric tests were conducted at ages 10 and 18. A total of 274,709 CpGs were included in two prediction periods (PPs): neonatal DNA-M to lung function at age 10 (PP1) and DNA-M at age 10 to lung function at 18 (PP2) using a training and testing screening method. Screened CpGs were corroborated in linear regression adjusted for confounders and the false discovery rate. Then we compared whether significant CpGs identified in one PP were also significantly associated with lung function in other PP. Results: In PP1, 3 CpGs and 20 in PP2 were identified with statistically significant similar effects ( P value range 5.2E-06 to 0.0496) in both periods. Among these loci, a number of genes are known to be involved in lung disease, for instance, TIE1, RARB, EBF3, IRX4 , and TBCD were found to be related with lung function; PRDM16, PTPRG, PRDM1, TIAM2, MEIS1 and NME2 were linked to lung cancer. Conclusions: Screening for CpGs in early life may help to identify children at higher risk of reduced lung function and serve as candidate loci for future studies.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shadia Khan Sunny"", ids = ""84082518""); list(name = ""Akhilesh Kaushal"", ids = ""3833475""); list(name = ""Hongmei Zhang"", ids = ""49723830""); list(name = ""Syed Hasan Arshad"", ids = ""2419927""); list(name = ""John W.

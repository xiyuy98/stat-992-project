88b7ceb335a3e88333a86d60e41454da21e2875e,Sample size determination for the false discovery rate,"MOTIVATION
There is not a widely applicable method to determine the sample size for experiments basing statistical significance on the false discovery rate (FDR).


RESULTS
We propose and develop the anticipated FDR (aFDR) as a conceptual tool for determining sample size. We derive mathematical expressions for the aFDR and anticipated average statistical power. These expressions are used to develop a general algorithm to determine sample size. We provide specific details on how to implement the algorithm for a k-group (k > or = 2) comparisons. The algorithm performs well for k-group comparisons in a series of traditional simulations and in a real-data simulation conducted by resampling from a large, publicly available dataset.

727bef807477c2e7fc2333328a19422fdebbe525,Introduction : overview of the RNA sequencing assay,"Gene expression is the fundamental level at which the result of various genetic and regulatory programs are observable. The measurement of transcriptomeÂ­wide gene expression has convincingly switched from microarrays to sequencing in a matter of years. RNA sequencing (RNAÂ­seq) provides a quantitative and open system for profiling transcriptional outcomes on a large scale and therefore facilitates a large diversity of applications, including basic science studies, but also agricultural or clinical situations. In the past 10 years or so, much has been learned about the characteristics of the RNAÂ­seq datasets as well as the performance of the myriad of methods developed. In this review, we give an overall view of the developments in RNAÂ­seq data analysis, including experimental design, with an explicit focus on quantification of gene expression and statistical approaches for differential expression. We also highlight emerging data types, such as singleÂ­cell RNAÂ­seq and gene expression profiling using longÂ­read technologies.

be0dcf78289bbddc2774d8b81813b12a61f917cd,Identification of quantitative trait loci for net form net blotch resistance in contemporary barley breeding germplasm from the USA using genome-wide association mapping,"Association mapping study conducted in a population of 3490 elite barley breeding lines from ten barley breeding programs of the USA identified 12 QTLs for resistance/susceptibility to net form of net blotch. Breeding resistant varieties is the best management strategy for net form of net blotch (NFNB) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) caused by Pyrenophora teres f. teres (Ptt). Several resistance QTL have been previously identified in barley via linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A GWAS conducted in a collection of advanced breeding lines (nâ€‰=â€‰3490) representing elite germplasm from ten barley breeding programs of the USA identified 42 unique marker-trait associations (MTA) for NFNB resistance. The lines were genotyped with 3072 SNP markers and phenotyped with four Ptt isolates in controlled environment. The lines were used to construct 13 different GWAS panels. Efficient mixed model association method with principal components and kinship was used for GWAS. Significance threshold for MTA was set at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Two, eight, six, one and 25 MTA were identified in chromosomes 1H, 3H, 4H, 5H and 6H, respectively. Based on genetic positions and linkage disequilibrium, these MTAâ€™s correspond to two, three, two, one and four QTLs in chromosome 1H, 3H, 4H, 5H and 6H, respectively. A comparison with previous linkage and GWAS studies revealed several previously identified and novel QTLs. Moreover, different genomic regions were found to be responsible for NFNB resistance in two-row versus six-row germplasm. The germplasm-specific SNP markers with additive effects and allelic distribution is reported to facilitate breeders in selection of markers for MAS to introgress novel net blotch resistance.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anil Adhikari"", ids = ""84728887""); list(name = ""Brian J.

Approximately 6500 male and female G(3) hybrid mice were phenotyped at 8 and 10 wk of age by DXA analysis for evidence of changes in unadjusted or body weight-adjusted BMD or BMC. Phenodeviant lines were identified based on statistical criteria that included a false discovery rate (FDR) <20% and Z-score >2.8. Genome-wide mapping scans were initiated on 22 lines, with evidence of high or low BMD or BMC that deviated by approximately -30% to +50% from the means. Several lines were discontinued as showing lack of heritability, but two heritable lines were identified with narrow chromosomal regions that allowed sequencing of potential mutant candidate genes. Novel mutations were identified in the Enpp1 (C397S) gene on chromosome 10 (line 4482) and the Ptpn6 (I482F) gene on chromosome 6 (line 4489) that were both associated with low bone mass. In addition, the phenotype of the Enpp1 mice showed a striking joint disease and calcification of blood vessels including the aorta, myocardium, and renal arteries and capillaries. These results support a role for the Enpp1 gene in the pathogenesis associated with mineralization of articular cartilage and vascular calcification. This work confirms the utility of the chemical mutagenesis approach for identification of potential disease genes and confirms the role of Enpp1 and Ptpn6 in regulating mineralization and skeletal bone mass.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Philip Babij"", ids = ""4712906""); list(name = ""Martine Roudier"", ids = ""46901696""); list(name = ""Tom Graves"", ids = ""48532260""); list(name = ""Chun-ya E.

We then tested whether we could replicate these findings in the independent cohort ALSPAC and followed-up our top finding with children of the IOW cohort.ResultsWe identified 10 CpG sites associated with adolescent asthma at a 5% false discovery rate (IOW, nâ€‰=â€‰370), five of which exhibited evidence of associations in the replication study (ALSPAC, nâ€‰=â€‰720). One site, cg16658191, within HK1 displayed particularly strong associations after cellular heterogeneity adjustments in both cohorts (ORIOWâ€‰=â€‰0.17, 95% CI 0.04â€“0.57) (ORALSPACâ€‰=â€‰0.57, 95% CI 0.38â€“0.87). Additionally, higher expression of HK1 (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.81, 95% CI 1.41â€“11.77) in cord blood was predictive of wheezing in infancy (nâ€‰=â€‰82).ConclusionWe identified novel associations between asthma and wheeze with methylation at cg16658191 and the expression of HK1, which may serve as markers of, predictors of, and potentially etiologic factors involved in asthma and early life wheeze.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Todd M.

40eb9dad0e594c0e6e4e4a204f079e8b3dcc8299,Tracking intrinsic connectivity brain network features during successive (Pseudo-) resting states and interoceptive task fMRI.,"Advanced multivariate analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contras have revealed that the human brain organizes its activities into multiple intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Several fMRI studies have evaluated the modulations of these networks during different cognitive or emotional tasks using blind source separation techniques particularly the independent component analysis (ICA). In this exploratory study, we applied ICA methodology to examine ICN modulations under different interoceptive conditions. Fifteen right-handed healthy subjects (age range 21-48 years) underwent a series of eyes-open resting-state and interoceptive task fMRI scans. Using a high-order ICA model, the functional imaging data were decomposed into 75 independent components and 36 were identified as non-artifactual ICNs. ICN spatial modulations were evaluated in terms of the network volume and maximum activations. ICN temporal modulations were assessed based on the power density frequency spectra. Following a false discovery rate multiple comparison correction threshold of Ï <; 0.05, we found significant changes in spatial feature of the attention/cognitive, default-mode, visual and salience networks. More liberal statistical criteria (uncorrected Ï <; 0.05) also indicated differences in network volumes between different states especially involving the sensorimotor, subcortical, cerebellar and brainstem networks. Significant power spectra changes were also found in several attention/cognitive and visual networks as well as the sensorimotor, salience, and subcortical networks especially when resting-states where compared with the interoceptive task fMRI. Further investigations of how interoceptive sensations alter the spatial and temporal features of the human brain networks can elucidate the foundational underpinnings of brain-body relation.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Behnaz Jarrahi"", ids = ""2581057""); list(name = ""Dante Mantini"", ids = ""2702784"")",,,Conference proceedings : ...

790864012614a13056d267274704b77cf661359b,Transcriptomics and methylomics of CD4-positive T cells in arsenic-exposed women,"Arsenic, a carcinogen with immunotoxic effects, is a common contaminant of drinking water and certain food worldwide. We hypothesized that chronic arsenic exposure alters gene expression, potentially by altering DNA methylation of genes encoding central components of the immune system. We therefore analyzed the transcriptomes (by RNA sequencing) and methylomes (by target-enrichment next-generation sequencing) of primary CD4-positive T cells from matched groups of four women each in the Argentinean Andes, with fivefold differences in urinary arsenic concentrations (median concentrations of urinary arsenic in the lower- and high-arsenic groups: 65 and 276 Î¼g/l, respectively). Arsenic exposure was associated with genome-wide alterations of gene expression; principal component analysis indicated that the exposure explained 53% of the variance in gene expression among the top variable genes and 19% of 28,351 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05) between the exposure groups. Key genes regulating the immune system, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, as well as genes related to the NF-kappa-beta complex, were significantly downregulated in the high-arsenic group. Arsenic exposure was associated with genome-wide DNA methylation; the high-arsenic group had 3% points higher genome-wide full methylation (>80% methylation) than the lower-arsenic group. Differentially methylated regions that were hyper-methylated in the high-arsenic group showed enrichment for immune-related gene ontologies that constitute the basic functions of CD4-positive T cells, such as isotype switching and lymphocyte activation and differentiation. In conclusion, chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water was related to changes in the transcriptome and methylome of CD4-positive T cells, both genome wide and in specific genes, supporting the hypothesis that arsenic causes immunotoxicity by interfering with gene expression and regulation.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Karin SchlÃ¤wicke EngstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""3073597""); list(name = ""Tomasz K.

5973a7a2fb0c901894b440e62662fa9757fe469f,Profiles of lacunar and nonlacunar stroke.,"OBJECTIVE
Determining which small deep infarcts (SDIs) are of lacunar, arterial, or cardioembolic etiology is challenging, but important in delivering optimal stroke prevention therapy. We sought to distinguish lacunar from nonlacunar causes of SDIs using a gene expression profile.


METHODS
A total of 184 ischemic strokes were analyzed. Lacunar stroke was defined as a lacunar syndrome with infarction <15mm in a region supplied by penetrating arteries. RNA from blood was processed on whole genome microarrays. Genes differentially expressed between lacunar (n = 30) and nonlacunar strokes (n = 86) were identified (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05, fold change >|1.5|) and used to develop a prediction model. The model was evaluated by cross-validation and in a second test cohort (n = 36). The etiology of SDIs of unclear cause (SDIs â‰¥ 15mm or SDIs with potential embolic source) (n = 32) was predicted using the derived model.


RESULTS
A 41-gene profile discriminated lacunar from nonlacunar stroke with >90% sensitivity and specificity. Of the 32 SDIs of unclear cause, 15 were predicted to be lacunar, and 17 were predicted to be nonlacunar. The identified profile represents differences in immune response between lacunar and nonlacunar stroke.


INTERPRETATION
Profiles of differentially expressed genes can distinguish lacunar from nonlacunar stroke. SDIs of unclear cause were frequently predicted to be of nonlacunar etiology, suggesting that comprehensive workup of SDIs is important to identify potential cardioembolic and arterial causes. Further study is required to evaluate the gene profile in an independent cohort and determine the clinical and treatment implications of SDIs of predicted nonlacunar etiology.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Glen C.

96299bab9b0d52dd0a9f80c11b73f0b24ba1bf03,Hierarchical Bayesian analysis of somatic mutation data in cancer,"Identifying genes underlying cancer development is critical to cancer biology and has important implications across prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Cancer sequencing studies aim at discovering genes with high frequencies of somatic mutations in specific types of cancer, as these genes are potential driving factors (drivers) for cancer development. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian methodology to estimate gene-specific mutation rates and driver probabilities from somatic mutation data and to shed light on the overall proportion of drivers among sequenced genes. Our methodology applies to different experimental designs used in practice, including one-stage, two-stage and candidate gene designs. Also, sample sizes are typically small relative to the rarity of individual mutations. Via a shrinkage method borrowing strength from the whole genome in assessing individual genes, we reinforce inference and address the selection effects induced by multistage designs. Our simulation studies show that the posterior driver probabilities provide a nearly unbiased false discovery rate estimate. We apply our methods to pancreatic and breast cancer data, contrast our results to previous estimates and provide estimated proportions of drivers for these two types of cancer.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jie Ding"", ids = ""143798671""); list(name = ""Lorenzo Trippa"", ids = ""2140808""); list(name = ""Xiaogang Zhong"", ids = ""46812649""); list(name = ""Giovanni Parmigiani"", ids = ""9619706"")",c569f1e908ef702f126804cbb52cad82436bc6d2; 613a930bffebb3290808a1ae6b4f2175a6abe649; 053567ab911a46995f358eaf306c3aea44071030; 96299bab9b0d52dd0a9f80c11b73f0b24ba1bf03,5cea3127ca1124cb22b11b1585df4c686997f6ee; c5ac97a162af43717de3204c2f0729708b37f300; e4bdb9bb848d6307566a56cabde6ee066e401db9; 24e1d6a4896a2d99a8aef5bcbdda53acb89e2762; 2dd71afbba31cb8fec2c762637fc211b568a1a2e; 6409a75766a2ae809c17823c91abaf58cc09292b; 3e79cf7526d894e6c19d04ceb674d30655b8c597; 99c239ec7156a96671492085691918851e450589; b8593122c6b1dd2432125a4eeb1a908c280b1d1d; b28601fcf04a44a22722ce530161d87f3ec8655c; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; e1c1beead2f1bd31d9701aec11d3aa2740784e15; 5328db55d93a77fcdd6638e23f21226f1108cdb8; b9b7031e1a6b634a2e97841ac760960ed6f968d4; 2d5b040efec060b33c1c4ef72231655de93398c4; f801115fa7a242cf487b40d5d1f4b0a552596d7a; 84272e62bcebb83d052ae2b2607de15caa4bc221; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; da80537018090a0a80a540eb81939ce9fcee603c; 34d8208de9f28bf9fba4c3389a6940725ce919cd; e2c9e82731305bb7da1e74f023e10c18ad3744bd; c36566a75fea71c8412f9eb1d8264e34cc58959b; d141296b801e73506641f1a21e06bf28fdfc9312; 3f93d95b998575a72efd5a8d4b87a8f1dbd2850b; 8f24c071dfa0c2ed0e25e06610805aaf235b1983; 96299bab9b0d52dd0a9f80c11b73f0b24ba1bf03; 0937134ff31b318d254bce3242dbe2031a6738d3; dec1ba636fe2c59afc45de95a2a8a305c5786924,The Annals of Applied Statistics,7,883-903
51ac899653f01fabd08938e93dcb20dd77175a0b,64: Anorexia Nervosa and Obsessive Compulsive Polygenic Risk Score: Associations with Adolescent Eating Disorder Phenotypes,"Background Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are highly heritable (~50â€“60%) and positively significantly genetically correlated (rg=0.48â€“0.55), suggesting that the same markers confer risk for both disorders. We hypothesized that an AN and OCD polygenic risk scores (PRS) could explain individual differences in adolescent eating behaviors in a large population-based cohort (~4,500 participants), the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Methods We calculated PRS in our dataset of 3,495 female AN cases from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-Eating Disorders workgroup and 2,688 male and female OCD cases from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-Obsessive Compulsive Disorders workgroup. We calculated Principal Components (PCs) using Eigensoft and identified case-control significant PCs in R. PRS calculation was performed using PRSice (http://prsice.info/) with case-control significant PCs as covariates. We correlated AN and OCD PRS with parent- and child-reported continuous and categorical eating disorder phenotypes for boys and girls in the ALSPAC cohort and controlled for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Results Preliminary results show that, for the AN PRS and OCD PRS, the best fitting p-value thresholds were at pT=.01 and pT= 0.05 respectively. The AN PRS was significantly correlated with adolescent-report of greater thin ideal internalization (r=0.04, p=0.018), dieting (r=0.04, p=0.013), and pressure to lose weight (r=0.023, p=0.05) at age 14. The OCD PRS was significantly positively correlated with any parent or adolescent-reported eating disorder diagnosis by age 18 (r=0.05, p=0.006). Discussion Our analyses provide evidence that AN and OCD PRS can explain a small but statistically significant percentage of the variance in eating disorder phenotypes in adolescence in the general population. In addition, generating a multi-trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction (mtGBLUP) PRS of genetically-correlated disorders has been shown to increase predictive ability equivalent to 34â€“76% increase in sample size. Thus, we plan to construct a multi-trait AN-OCD PRS and continue to examine its association with adolescent eating disorder cognitions and behaviors in this large population-based cohort.",2019,Psychology,"list(name = ""Zeynep Yilmaz"", ids = ""47043235""); list(name = ""Katherine Schaumberg"", ids = ""51491731""); list(name = ""James Crowley"", ids = ""145687021""); list(name = ""Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Eating Disorders Workgroup"", ids = ""88726648""); list(name = ""Stephanie Zerwas"", ids = ""3372146"")",,,European Neuropsychopharmacology,29,s818-s819

a15e1f238fc526b86c50ee0945b17ea2cee8fbdc,Statistical Significance Threshold Criteria For Analysis of Microarray Gene Expression Data,"The methodological advancement in microarray data analysis on the basis of false discovery rate (FDR) control, such as the q-value plots, allows the investigator to examine the FDR from several perspectives. However, when FDR control at the â€œcustomary"" levels 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 does not provide fruitful findings, there is little guidance for making the trade off between the significance threshold and the FDR level by sound statistical or biological considerations. Thus, meaningful statistical significance criteria that complement the existing FDR methods for large-scale multiple tests are desirable. Three statistical significance criteria, the profile information criterion, the total error proportion, and the guide-gene driven selection, are developed in this research. The first two are general significance threshold criteria for large-scale multiple tests; the profile information criterion is related to the recent theoretical studies of the connection between FDR control and minimax estimation, and the total error proportion is closely related to the asymptotic properties of FDR control in terms of the total error risk. The guide-gene driven selection is an approach to combining statistical significance and the existing biological knowledge of the study at hand. Error properties of these criteria are investigated theoretically and by simulation. The proposed methods are illustrated and compared using an example of genomic screening for novel Arf gene targets. Operating characteristics of q-value and the proposed significance threshold criteria are investigated and compared in a simulation study that employs a model mimicking a gene regulatory pathway. A guideline for using these criteria is provided.

Cell cultures of E. californica were investigated as an alternative and scalable method for producing these valuable compounds; treatment with yeast extract increased production from low levels to 23 mg/g dry weight (DW) of BPAs. A shotgun proteomic analysis of E. californica cell cultures was undertaken to explore changes in metabolism associated with enhanced BPA production. We implemented differential centrifugation and then shotgun proteomics based on nanoliquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) for peptide separation and analysis. A unigene database available for E. californica was translated and utilized for protein identification. Approximately 646 proteins (3% false discovery rate at the protein level) were identified. Differentially abundant proteins observed with elicitation included enzymes involved in (S)-adenosyl methionine (SAM) biosynthesis and BPA biosynthesis. These results demonstrate (1) the identification of proteins from a medicinal plant using shotgun proteomics combined with a well-annotated, translated unigene database and (2) the potential utility of proteomics for exploring changes in metabolism associated with enhanced secondary metabolite production.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""John T Oldham"", ids = ""11946961""); list(name = ""Marina Hincapie"", ids = ""4572691""); list(name = ""TomÃ¡Å¡ Rejtar"", ids = ""3927866""); list(name = ""P.

2fe5d58bac46490cfd99c88564e87ac8a359f891,"Letrozole-, anastrozole-, and tamoxifen-responsive genes in MCF-7aro cells: a microarray approach.","Antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors are important drugs in the treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. To investigate the effects of these drugs on gene expression in breast cancer cells, we treated estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the aromatase gene (known as MCF-7aro cells) with testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol, two aromatase inhibitors (letrozole and anastrozole), and an antiestrogen (tamoxifen). We found that testosterone or 17 beta-estradiol induced the proliferation of MCF-7aro cells at a rate six times faster than the untreated cells. In addition, the testosterone-induced proliferation of MCF-7aro cells was effectively suppressed by letrozole, anastrozole, or tamoxifen. Microarray analyses on Affymetrix Human Genome U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were carried out using total RNA isolated from the control and treated cells. At the false discovery rate of 0.05 and a minimum fold-change criteria of 1.5, 104 genes were identified that were up-regulated and 109 genes were identified that were down-regulated by both androgen and estrogen. More than 50% of these hormone-regulated genes were counter-regulated by all three inhibitors and >90% were counter-regulated by at least one of the inhibitors. Comparing the effect of each inhibitor on gene expression, we observed that letrozole and anastrozole are more similar in terms of the genes they affect compared with treatment with tamoxifen. To validate the gene expression profiles identified from microarray analyses, the expression patterns of 13 representative genes were examined by Northern analysis.

It is well known that total CD4 counts degrade as the disease progress, so that the CD4 data can be treated as a special type of degradation data. It is also critical to identify HIV-resistant subjects with non-decreasing CD4 curves, i.e., the HIV/AIDS nonprogressors. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive statistical analysis strategy motivated and designed specifically to fit unique characters of the CD4 count data, which includes steps such as exploratory data analysis, modeling, and statistical inference. We formulate the problem into a simultaneous hypothesis testing problem. The inferential model (IM), a new prior-free probabilistic inference framework, is applied to locate HIV nonprogressors with the uncertainty characterization. We compared it with the classical Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling false discovery rate (FDR).",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shuang Hua He"", ids = ""48798838""); list(name = ""Chuanhai Liu"", ids = ""2206362""); list(name = ""Xiao Wang"", ids = ""12142608"")",,,,,293-306
9fa05013641ef44a9a61af60e2354dfff82a8465,Discovery of tandem and interspersed segmental duplications using high-throughput sequencing,"MOTIVATION
Several algorithms have been developed that use high throughput sequencing technology to characterize structural variations. Most of the existing approaches focus on detecting relatively simple types of SVs such as insertions, deletions, and short inversions. In fact, complex SVs are of crucial importance and several have been associated with genomic disorders. To better understand the contribution of complex SVs to human disease, we need new algorithms to accurately discover and genotype such variants. Additionally, due to similar sequencing signatures, inverted duplications or gene conversion events that include inverted segmental duplications are often characterized as simple inversions, likewise, duplications and gene conversions in direct orientation may be called as simple deletions. Therefore, there is still a need for accurate algorithms to fully characterize complex SVs and thus improve calling accuracy of more simple variants.


RESULTS
We developed novel algorithms to accurately characterize tandem, direct and inverted interspersed segmental duplications using short read whole genome sequencing data sets. We integrated these methods to our TARDIS tool, which is now capable of detecting various types of SVs using multiple sequence signatures such as read pair, read depth and split read.We evaluated the prediction performance of our algorithms through several experiments using both simulated and real data sets. In the simulation experiments, using a 30â¨¯ coverage TARDIS achieved 96% sensitivity with only 4% false discovery rate. For experiments that involve real data, we used two haploid genomes (CHM1 and CHM13) and one human genome (NA12878) from the Illumina Platinum Genomes set. Comparison of our results with orthogonal PacBio call sets from the same genomes revealed higher accuracy for TARDIS than state of the art methods. Furthermore, we showed a surprisingly low false discovery rate of our approach for discovery of tandem, direct and inverted interspersed segmental duplications prediction on CHM1 (less than 5% for the top 50 predictions).

We build on existing computational methods to combine Alu detection and de novo assembly of WGS data as a means to reconstruct the full sequence of insertion events from Illumina paired end reads. Comparison with published calls obtained using PacBio long-reads indicates a false discovery rate below 5%, at the cost of reduced sensitivity due to the colocation of reference and non-reference repeats. We generate a highly accurate call set of 1,614 completely assembled Alu variants from 53 samples from the Human Genome Diversity Project panel. We utilize the reconstructed alternative insertion haplotypes to genotype 1,010 fully assembled insertions, obtaining >99% agreement with genotypes obtained by PCR. In our assembled sequences, we find evidence of premature insertion mechanisms and observe 5â€™ truncation in 16% of AluYa5 and AluYb8 insertions. The sites of truncation coincide with stem-loop structures and SRP9/14 binding sites in the Alu RNA, implicating L1 ORF2p pausing in the generation of 5â€™ truncations.

e53bbfe0cb4ee32598532b8ce52c00679b5c5618,Gene-by-environment effect of house dust mite on purinergic receptor P2Y12 (P2RY12) and lung function in children with asthma.,"BACKGROUND
Distinct receptors likely exist for leukotriene (LT)E(4), a potent mediator of airway inflammation. Purinergic receptor P2Y12 is needed for LTE(4)-induced airways inflammation, and P2Y12 antagonism attenuates house dust mite-induced pulmonary eosinophilia in mice. Although experimental data support a role for P2Y12 in airway inflammation, its role in human asthma has never been studied.


OBJECTIVE
To test for association between variants in the P2Y12 gene (P2RY12) and lung function in human subjects with asthma, and to examine for gene-by-environment interaction with house dust mite exposure.


METHODS
Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P2RY12 were genotyped in 422 children with asthma and their parents (n = 1266). Using family based methods, we tested for associations between these SNPs and five lung function measures. We performed haplotype association analyses and tested for gene-by-environment interactions using house dust mite exposure. We used the false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons.


RESULTS
Five SNPs in P2RY12 were associated with multiple lung function measures (P-values 0.006â€“0.025). Haplotypes in P2RY12 were also associated with lung function (P-values 0.0055â€“0.046). House dust mite exposure modulated associations between P2RY12 and lung function, with minor allele homozygotes exposed to house dust mite demonstrating worse lung function than those unexposed (significant interaction P-values 0.0028â€“0.040).


CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
The P2RY12 variants were associated with lung function in a large family-based asthma cohort. House dust mite exposure caused significant gene-by-environment effects. Our findings add the first human evidence to experimental data supporting a role for P2Y12 in lung function.

Serum and red cell folate levels (chemiluminescent immunoassay) and estimated folate intake (food frequency questionnaires) were determined. 6-n-propylthiouracil solutions were used to determine bitter taste phenotype (â€œtasterâ€/â€nontasterâ€). Differences between groups were assessed by t-tests, c2 tests and RR of AP. Results: TAS2R38 haplotype significantly, but only partially predicted taster phenotype (r 1â„4 0.43, c21â„435.5, p 50% improvement of symptoms, was assessed. Difference between the groups was tested via Fishers exact test. Results: Of 157 women with IBS, 56 (35%) had a concurrent diagnosis of endometriosis. The median age of those with endometriosis was 32 as opposed to those without where median age was 39 (p 1â„4 0.014). However, response was reported in 71% with endometriosis compared with 47% of those without endometriosis (p 1â„4 0.004). Conclusions: The high rate of response to a LFD suggests that this approach should be added to the repertoire of management strategies for endometriosis. Why the response was poorer in those without endometriosis was not clear. Funding source(s): N/A.

Dordevic) Background/Aims: Profiling the transcriptomic regulation of adipose tissue (AT) by dietary manipulation in MetS will elucidate therapeutic and nutritional targets for chronic disease management. Methods: Seventeen men (8 control; 9 MetS) were recruited to participate in a controlled randomised, single-blinded crossover single meal study. Participants consumed either a saturated fatty acid (FA)-rich breakfast or an unsaturated FA-rich breakfast. AT biopsies were taken at baseline (0 h), and 4 h following each test meal. Global gene expression profiling of the AT was performed using Illumina HumanWG-6 v3 microarray chips followed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using DAVID software. Pathways were considered significant with Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) score < 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) value < 0.05. Results: Two pathways that were differentially regulated in MetS compared to control AT at baseline were also enriched by the following meal consumption. The Lysosome pathway was up-regulated (p < 0.001) and the Ribosome pathway was down-regulated (p < 0.001) in MetS AT compared with controls at baseline. Control AT exhibited enrichment of the Lysosome pathway with the SFA meal (p1â„4 0.001) and MetS AT showed enrichment of the Ribosome pathway after the UFA meal (p 1â„4 0.02). Conclusions: Lysosome and Ribosome pathways are impaired in MetS AT and can be manipulated by alterations in meal composition. This finding is important in the discovery of potential nutritional targets for chronic metabolic disease. Funding source(s): Dairy Health & Nutrition Consortium (DHNC).

1c6f1f2d4180dfca9cb1578171b2c4e5a18fb16c,Progression of language decline and cortical atrophy in subtypes of primary progressive aphasia,"Objectives:To examine the longitudinal course of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) over a 2-year period and to offer quantitative ranges of expected change that could be used to guide the design and evaluation of therapeutic intervention trials. Methods:Regional changes of cortical thickness and whole-brain cortical volume loss as well as neuropsychological language performance were assessed at baseline and 2 years later in 13 rigorously characterized patients who fulfilled research criteria for logopenic, agrammatic, and semantic PPA subtypes (6 PPA-L, 3 PPA-G, and 4 PPA-S). Results:There was substantial progression of clinical deficits and cortical atrophy over 2 years. Neuropsychological language performance patterns lost the sharp distinctions that differentiated one PPA variant from another. Nonetheless, the subtype-specific differential impairment of word comprehension vs grammatical processing was largely maintained. Peak atrophy sites spread beyond the initial distinctive locations that characterized each of the 3 subtypes and displayed a more convergent distribution encompassing all 3 major components of the language network: the inferior frontal gyrus, the temporoparietal junction, and lateral temporal cortex. Despite the progression, overall peak atrophy remained lateralized to the left hemisphere. Conclusions:The results suggest that the unique features, which sharply differentiate the PPA variants at the early to middle stages, may lose their distinctiveness as the degeneration becomes more severe. Given the substantial atrophy over 2 years, PPA clinical trials may require fewer patients and shorter study durations than Alzheimer disease trials to detect significant therapeutic effects.

b234717b2d266ac3f3a0133beb685688d7db416e,Semiquantitative Analysis of Clinical Heat Stress in Clostridium difficile Strain 630 Using a GeLC/MS Workflow with emPAI Quantitation,"Clostridium difficile is considered to be the most frequent cause of infectious bacterial diarrhoea in hospitals worldwide yet its adaptive ability remains relatively uncharacterised. Here, we used GeLC/MS and the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) calculation to determine proteomic changes in response to a clinically relevant heat stress. Reproducibility between both biological and technical replicates was good, and a 37uC proteome of 224 proteins was complemented by a 41uC proteome of 202 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate. Overall, 236 C. difficile proteins were identified and functionally categorised, of which 178 were available for comparative purposes. A total of 65 proteins (37%) were modulated by 1.5-fold or more at 41uC compared to 37uC and we noted changes in the majority of proteins associated with amino acid metabolism, including upregulation of the reductive branch of the leucine fermentation pathway. Motility was reduced at 41uC as evidenced by a 2.7 fold decrease in the flagellar filament protein, FliC, and a global increase in proteins associated with detoxification and adaptation to atypical conditions was observed, concomitant with decreases in proteins mediating transcriptional elongation and the initiation of protein synthesis. Trigger factor was down regulated by almost 5-fold. We propose that under heat stress, titration of the GroESL and dnaJK/grpE chaperones by misfolded proteins will, in the absence of trigger factor, prevent nascent chains from emerging efficiently from the ribosome causing translational stalling and also an increase in secretion. The current work has thus allowed development of a heat stress model for the key cellular processes of protein folding and export.

14238d1fbe7082625ac4086573ba9e9a9f45d9f3,Gene expression profile of aging in human muscle.,"Studies of gene expression related to aging of skeletal muscle have included few subjects or a limited number of genes. We conducted the present study to produce more comprehensive gene expression profiles. RNA was extracted from vastus lateralis biopsies obtained from healthy young (21-27 yr old, n = 8) and older men (67-75 yr old, n = 8) and was analyzed with high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Of the approximately 44,000 probe sets on the arrays, approximately 18,000 yielded adequate signals for statistical analysis. There were approximately 700 probe sets for which t-tests or rank sum tests indicated a difference (P <or= 0.01) in mean expression between young and old and for which the estimated false discovery rate was <10%. Most of these differences were less than 1.5-fold in magnitude. Genes that encode proteins involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial protein synthesis were expressed at a lower level in older muscle. Genes encoding metallothioneins, high-mobility-group proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins and other RNA binding/processing proteins, and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway were expressed at higher levels in older muscle. Expression of numerous genes involved with stress responses, hormone/cytokine/growth factor signaling, control of the cell cycle and apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation appeared to be affected by aging. More transcripts were detected in older muscle, suggesting dedifferentiation, an increased number of splice variants, or increased cellular heterogeneity. We conclude that in human skeletal muscle the expression of many genes tends to increase or decrease between the third and seventh decades. The changes are modest when averaged over all of the cells in the tissue.",2003,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Stephen Welle"", ids = ""3104012""); list(name = ""Andrew I.

fb8e49081eb6b60342af71c08d4d56a990fa001d,Controlling the joint local false discovery rate is more powerful than metaâ€analysis methods in joint analysis of summary statistics from multiple genomeâ€wide association studies,"Motivation: In genomeâ€wide association studies (GWASs) of common diseases/traits, we often analyze multiple GWASs with the same phenotype together to discover associated genetic variants with higher power. Since it is difficult to access data with detailed individual measurements, summaryâ€statisticsâ€based metaâ€analysis methods have become popular to jointly analyze datasets from multiple GWASs. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel summaryâ€statisticsâ€based joint analysis method based on controlling the joint local false discovery rate (Jlfdr). We prove that our method is the most powerful summaryâ€statisticsâ€based joint analysis method when controlling the false discovery rate at a certain level. In particular, the Jlfdrâ€based method achieves higher power than commonly used metaâ€analysis methods when analyzing heterogeneous datasets from multiple GWASs. Simulation experiments demonstrate the superior power of our method over metaâ€analysis methods. Also, our method discovers more associations than metaâ€analysis methods from empirical datasets of four phenotypes.

We have previously reported a top-ranked risk gene [i.e., serine incorporator 2 gene (SERINC2)] for alcohol dependence in individuals of European descent by analyzing the common variants in a genome-wide association study. In the present study, we comprehensively examined the rare variants [minor allele frequency (MAF)<0.05] in the NKAIN1-SERINC2 region to confirm our previous finding.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A discovery sample (1409 European-American patients with alcohol dependence and 1518 European-American controls) and a replication sample (6438 European-Australian family participants with 1645 alcohol-dependent probands) were subjected to an association analysis. A total of 39,903 individuals from 19 other cohorts with 11 different neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders served as contrast groups. The entire NKAIN1-SERINC2 region was imputed in all cohorts using the same reference panels of genotypes that included rare variants from the whole-genome sequencing data. We stringently cleaned the phenotype and genotype data, and obtained a total of about 220 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in individuals of European descent and about 450 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the individuals of African descent with 0<MAF<0.05 for an association analysis.


RESULTS
Using a weighted regression analysis implemented in the program SCORE-Seq, we found a rare variant constellation across the entire NKAIN1-SERINC2 region that was associated with alcohol dependence in European-Americans (Fp: overall, P=1.8Ã—10(-4); VT: overall, P=1.4Ã—10(-4); Collapsing, P=6.5Ã—10(-5)) and European-Australians (Fp: overall, P=0.028; Collapsing, P=0.025), but not in African-Americans, and not associated with any other disorder examined. Association signals in this region came mainly from SERINC2, a gene that codes for an activity-regulated protein expressed in the brain that incorporates serine into lipids. In addition, 26 individual rare variants were nominally associated with alcohol dependence in European-Americans (P<0.05). The associations of five of these rare variants that lay within SERINC2 showed region-wide significance (P<Î±=0.0006) and 25 associations survived correction for a false discovery rate (q<0.05). The associations of two rare variants at SERINC2 were replicated in European-Australians (P<0.05).


CONCLUSION
We concluded that SERINC2 was a replicable and significant risk gene specific for alcohol dependence in individuals of European descent.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lingjun Zuo"", ids = ""40603529""); list(name = ""Ke-sheng Wang"", ids = ""103073455""); list(name = ""Xiang-yang Zhang"", ids = ""31915262""); list(name = ""Chiang-shan Ray Li"", ids = ""1684484""); list(name = ""Fengyu Zhang"", ids = ""1812007""); list(name = ""Xiaoping Wang"", ids = ""145156380""); list(name = ""Wenan Chen"", ids = ""39983015""); list(name = ""Guimin Gao"", ids = ""3402339""); list(name = ""Heping Zhang"", ids = ""2532807""); list(name = ""John H.

e76dcf429cb511166e04a137a8f703cc8b13ead8,deGPS is a powerful tool for detecting differential expression in RNA-sequencing studies,"BackgroundThe advent of the NGS technologies has permitted profiling of whole-genome transcriptomes (i.e., RNA-Seq) at unprecedented speed and very low cost. RNA-Seq provides a far more precise measurement of transcript levels and their isoforms compared to other methods such as microarrays. A fundamental goal of RNA-Seq is to better identify expression changes between different biological or disease conditions. However, existing methods for detecting differential expression from RNA-Seq count data have not been comprehensively evaluated in large-scale RNA-Seq datasets. Many of them suffer from inflation of type I error and failure in controlling false discovery rate especially in the presence of abnormal high sequence read counts in RNA-Seq experiments.ResultsTo address these challenges, we propose a powerful and robust tool, termed deGPS, for detecting differential expression in RNA-Seq data. This framework contains new normalization methods based on generalized Poisson distribution modeling sequence count data, followed by permutation-based differential expression tests. We systematically evaluated our new tool in simulated datasets from several large-scale TCGA RNA-Seq projects, unbiased benchmark data from compcodeR package, and real RNA-Seq data from the development transcriptome of Drosophila. deGPS can precisely control type I error and false discovery rate for the detection of differential expression and is robust in the presence of abnormal high sequence read counts in RNA-Seq experiments.ConclusionsSoftware implementing our deGPS was released within an R package with parallel computations (https://github.com/LL-LAB-MCW/deGPS). deGPS is a powerful and robust tool for data normalization and detecting different expression in RNA-Seq experiments. Beyond RNA-Seq, deGPS has the potential to significantly enhance future data analysis efforts from many other high-throughput platforms such as ChIP-Seq, MBD-Seq and RIP-Seq.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chen Chu"", ids = ""144775577""); list(name = ""Zhaoben Fang"", ids = ""2131898""); list(name = ""Xing Cheng Hua"", ids = ""143831998""); list(name = ""Yaning Yang"", ids = ""2750437""); list(name = ""Enguo Chen"", ids = ""35476935""); list(name = ""Allen W.

B129 

Red meat and processed meat are positively associated with risk of colorectal neoplasia. One of the potential mechanisms underlying the association of meat with cancer is via the mutagenic action of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formed during high temperature cooking. Phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) are involved in the initial steps of activation of xenobiotics to mutagenic and carcinogenic intermediates. Phase II XMEs convert original xenobiotic compounds and their phase I-activated metabolites to polar and detoxified metabolites. However, with certain compounds, such as HCAs, phase II XMEs may further activate metabolites to form other carcinogenic species. We evaluated 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several phase I (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4) and phase II (EPHX1, GSTM1, GSTM2, GSTT1, NAT1, NAT2, NQO1, SULT1A1, and SULT1A2) XME genes in relation to advanced colorectal adenoma and investigated potential effect modification by red meat, HCA, and PAH intake. All SNPS were selected based on known or suggested functional relevance and a minor allele frequency of 5% or greater in Caucasians.

Participants were selected from individuals who were enrolled in the screening arm (n = 77,483) of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial between 1993 and 1999. We compared 720 cases with advanced colorectal adenoma (size of 1cm or greater, high grade dysplasia, or villous components, including tubulovillous) of the distal colon or rectum to 746 controls frequency matched on gender and ethnicity (negative for left-sided polyp by sigmoidoscopy). Using a 137-item food frequency questionnaire that included detailed questions on meat cooking methods and doneness levels in conjunction with a HCA and PAH database, we generated intake estimates of the HCAs, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), and the PAH, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) in ng/day. Odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity. Tests for interaction were based on the likelihood ratio test by comparing models with and without interaction terms.

Overall, we found weak or null associations between the individual XME genes or SNPs with risk of advanced colorectal adenoma. However, we observed interactions between intake of PhIP and variation in CYP1B1 (rs10012 Pinteraction = 0.019; rs1056836 Pinteraction = 0.019), and NQO1 (rs1800566 Pinteraction = 0.007) with advanced colorectal adenoma. We also found evidence of interaction with intake of B[a]P for variation in CYP1B1 (rs10012 Pinteraction = 0.005) and CYP3A4 (rs2242480 Pinteraction = 0.02). In addition, there was an interaction with intake of red meat and CYP1B1 (rs10012 Pinteraction = 0.013) and NAT1 variants (rs15561 Pinteraction = 0.037). However, when considering multiple comparisons, these interactions did not fall below a false discovery rate threshold of 0.20. Our results are intriguing and suggest that common variants in XME genes may modify the association of red meat, HCA, and PAH intake with advanced colorectal adenoma, but require confirmation in larger studies.

942ebb1bcdc6487b38ec9434a735e788fcea1a9a,BLR-D: applying bilinear logistic regression to factored diagnosis problems,"In this paper, we address a pattern of diagnosis problems in which each of J entities produces the same K features, yet we are only informed of overall faults from the ensemble. Furthermore, we suspect that only certain entities and certain features are leading to the problem. The task, then, is to reliably identify which entities and which features are at fault. Such problems are particularly prevalent in the world of computer systems, in which a datacenter with hundreds of machines, each with the same performance counters, occasionally produces overall faults. In this paper, we present a means of using a constrained form of bilinear logistic regression for diagnosis in such problems. The bilinear treatment allows us to represent the scenarios with J+K instead of JK parameters, resulting in more easily interpretable results and far fewer false positives compared to treating the parameters independently. We develop statistical tests to determine which features and entities, if any, may be responsible for the labeled faults, and use false discovery rate (FDR) analysis to ensure that our values are meaningful.

Salt sensitivity of blood pressure (SSBP) increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, and the heritability of SSBP is about 50% in Chinese population. However, studies identifying genes involved in BP responses to acute sodium loading and diuresis shrinkage are still limited.


METHOD
A total of 342 essential hypertensives from Beijing were recruited in our study. A modified Sullivan's acute oral saline load and diuresis shrinkage test was conducted to each individual. Medical history and lifestyle risk factors were obtained by questionnaire. Generalized linear model was used to examine the associations of 29 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with SSBP and false discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct P values for multiple testing.


RESULTS
In the process of acute sodium loading, after adjusting for age and 24-hour urinary sodium concentration, SNPs in CYP11B2, PRKG1, SLC8A1 genes were significantly associated with systolic BP (SBP) rising in the additive and recessive model; SNPs in CYP4A11, PRKG1, SLC8A1, and ADRB2 genes were significantly associated with diastolic BP (DBP) rising. In the process of diuresis shrinkage, SNPs of CLCNKA, eNOS, PRKG1 gene were associated with SBP and DBP decreasing. After FDR correction, rs434082 in SLC8A1 gene was still significantly associated with blood pressure rising during salt load. In the additive model, A allele increased DBP of 2.8 mm Hg (FDR_q = 0.029) and MAP of 3.1 mm Hg (FDR_q = 0.029) after adjusting for age and 24-hour urinary sodium concentration.


CONCLUSION
SLC8A1 gene may contribute to BP change in the process of acute sodium loading in a Han Chinese population.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kuo Chi Liu"", ids = ""2117622""); list(name = ""Zheng Liu"", ids = ""47781687""); list(name = ""Han Qi"", ids = ""49447749""); list(name = ""Bin Liu"", ids = ""49166856""); list(name = ""Jingjing Wu"", ids = ""145475498""); list(name = ""Yezhou Liu"", ids = ""47908744""); list(name = ""Jie Zhang"", ids = ""1698586""); list(name = ""Han K.

cf839ac79a41a3aca112767087682fe13d77a2b0,[Association of coagulation factor V gene polymorphism with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion among ethnic Hans from Wenzhou area].,"OBJECTIVE
To assess the association of coagulation factor V gene polymorphisms with unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) among ethnic Han Chinese from Wenzhou area.


METHODS
Ninety-six patients with URSA and 103 females with a history of normal pregnancy were recruited. Genotypes of coagulation factor V gene were determined through target sequence capture and high-throughput sequencing. The results were confirmed with a MassARRAY system. Allelic and genotypic frequencies between the two groups were compared.


RESULTS
Nineteen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), except coagulation factor V Leiden, were identified in the two groups. The frequencies of rs9287090 allele A, rs1046712 allele T and rs1800594 allele G of the URSA group were lower than those of the control group (6.77% vs. 16.50%, 3.12% vs. 13.11%, 10.94% vs. 18.45%, respectively). After Bonferroni and false discovery rate correction, rs9287090 and rs1046712 were significantly associated with URSA (corrected P<0.05). Although genotypic distribution of rs9287090 and rs1046712 also differed between the two groups, the corrected P value showed no significance (corrected P>0.05). A complete linkage disequilibrium (r2=1, D'=1) of rs6022 and rs6029 was observed for the haplotype block rs6022-rs6029-rs6028. The frequencies of rs6022 allele A and rs6029 allele T were higher in the URSA group with corrected insignificance (75.00% vs. 65.53%, corrected P>0.05). Furthermore, significantly more A-T-T haplotype was found in the URSA group (75.00% vs. 65.50%, OR=1.578, 95%CI:1.021-2.438, Ï‡2=4.248, P<0.05).


CONCLUSION
The decreased rate of rs9287090 allele A, rs1046712 allele T, and rs1800594 allele G may contribute to the susceptibility to URSA among ethnic Han Chinese from Wenzhou area. The rs6022 allele A and rs6029 allele T may also predispose to URSA.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiaomin Xu"", ids = ""145883663""); list(name = ""Jiayong Zheng"", ids = ""5392818""); list(name = ""Hai guang Wang"", ids = ""49528077""); list(name = ""Shuqi Xia"", ids = ""13732350""); list(name = ""Min Lin"", ids = ""143953673""); list(name = ""Xiaoqing Li"", ids = ""48570111""); list(name = ""Xiaolu Shen"", ids = ""47435381"")",,,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,35 4,"

We used DNA microarrays to examine a broad spectrum of genes from the livers of mice rendered hypothyroid by treating pregnant mice from gestational d 13 to postnatal d 15 with 6-propyl-2-thiouracil in drinking water. Twenty-four individuals (one male and one female pup from six litters of control or 6-propyl-2-thiouracil treatment groups, respectively) were profiled using Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. MAANOVA identified 96 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate adjusted P < 0.1 and fold change > 2 in at least one gender). Of these, 72 genes encode proteins of known function, 15 of which had previously been identified as regulated by TH. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are involved in metabolism, development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. An immediate-early response gene, Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1), was up-regulated by 3-fold in hypothyroid juvenile mouse liver; treatment of HepG2 cells with T(3) resulted in down-regulation of Nr4a1. A potential thyroid response element -1218 to -1188 bp upstream of the promoter region of Nr4a1 was identified and demonstrated to bind TH receptor (TR)-alpha and TRbeta. Point mutation or deletion of the sequence containing the potential Nr4a1-thyroid response element in transient gene expression studies resulted in both higher basal expression and loss of T(3) regulatory capacity, suggesting that this site is responsible for the negative regulation of gene expression by TR and TH.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hongyan Dong"", ids = ""47866165""); list(name = ""Carole L.

A phase 2 randomized study (NCT02351739) treated 75 pts with mUC with either P or PA. We profiled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to understand changes on tx. Methods: Comprehensive immune profiling of PBMCs was performed at baseline, weeks (wk) 4, 7, and 10. The Wilcoxon rank sum (WRS) test was used to compare tx arms, as well as pts with complete and partial response (CR/PR) vs disease progression (PD). Using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method, results were deemed significant if they had false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1 or less. Results: Clinical responses did not differ between tx arms (Zhang T et al, ESMO, 2017). The majority of patients showed largest immune changes from baseline at wk7.

4f14e49dfd6f60b192c8e4c37ce290019ab0f979,Effects of missing marker and segregation distortion on QTL mapping in F2 populations,"Missing marker and segregation distortion are commonly encountered in actual quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping populations. Our objective in this study was to investigate the impact of the two factors on QTL mapping through computer simulations. Results indicate that detection power decreases with increasing levels of missing markers, and the false discovery rate increases. Missing markers have greater effects on smaller effect QTL and smaller size populations. The effect of missing markers can be quantified by a population with a reduced size similar to the marker missing rate. As for segregation distortion, if the distorted marker is not closely linked with any QTL, it will not have significant impact on QTL mapping; otherwise, the impact of the distortion will depend on the degree of dominance of QTL, frequencies of the three marker types, the linkage distance between the distorted marker and QTL, and the mapping population size. Sometimes, the distortion can result in a higher genetic variance than that of non-distortion, and therefore benefits the detection of linked QTL. A formula of the ratio of genetic variance explained by QTL under distortion and non-distortion was given in this study, so as to easily determine whether the segregation distortion marker (SDM) increases or decreases the QTL detection power. The effect of SDM decreases rapidly as its linkage relationship with QTL becomes looser. In general, distorted markers will not have a great effect on the position and effect estimations of QTL, and their effects can be ignored in large-size mapping populations.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Luyan Zhang"", ids = ""47058849"");

72abdf62805ce2cbfcb8e2f9c6d2517de5540efd,Shrinkage Estimation of Effect Sizes as an Alternative to Hypothesis Testing Followed by Estimation in High-Dimensional Biology: Applications to Differential Gene Expression,"Research on analyzing microarray data has focused on the problem of identifying differentially expressed genes to the neglect of the problem of how to integrate evidence that a gene is differentially expressed with information on the extent of its differential expression. Consequently, researchers currently prioritize genes for further study either on the basis of volcano plots or, more commonly, according to simple estimates of the fold change after filtering the genes with an arbitrary statistical significance threshold. While the subjective and informal nature of the former practice precludes quantification of its reliability, the latter practice is equivalent to using a hard-threshold estimator of the expression ratio that is not known to perform well in terms of mean-squared error, the sum of estimator variance and squared estimator bias. On the basis of two distinct simulation studies and data from different microarray studies, we systematically compared the performance of several estimators representing both current practice and shrinkage. We find that the threshold-based estimators usually perform worse than the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) and they often perform far worse as quantified by estimated mean-squared risk. By contrast, the shrinkage estimators tend to perform as well as or better than the MLE and never much worse than the MLE, as expected from what is known about shrinkage. However, a Bayesian measure of performance based on the prior information that few genes are differentially expressed indicates that hard-threshold estimators perform about as well as the local false discovery rate (FDR), the best of the shrinkage estimators studied. Based on the ability of the latter to leverage information across genes, we conclude that the use of the local-FDR estimator of the fold change instead of informal or threshold-based combinations of statistical tests and non-shrinkage estimators can be expected to substantially improve the reliability of gene prioritization at very little risk of doing so less reliably. Since the proposed replacement of post-selection estimates with shrunken estimates applies as well to other types of high-dimensional data, it could also improve the analysis of SNP data from genome-wide association studies.",2010,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zahra Montazeri"", ids = ""49995400""); list(name = ""Corey M.

d12dbedd09bc06c6f524da865abc1feec8fe33bf,ProteoStats - a library for estimating false discovery rates in proteomics pipelines,"SUMMARY
Statistical validation of peptide assignments from a large-scale shotgun proteomics experiment is a critical step, and various methods for evaluating significance based on decoy database search are in practice. False discovery rate (FDR) estimation of peptide assignments assesses global significance and corrects for multiple comparisons. Various approaches have been proposed for FDR estimation but unavailability of standard tools or libraries leads to development of many in-house scripts followed by manual steps that are error-prone and low-throughput. The ProteoStats library provides an open-source framework for developers with many FDR estimation and visualization features for several popular search algorithms. It also provides accurate q-values, which can be easily integrated in any proteomics pipeline to provide automated, accurate, high-throughput statistical validation and minimize manual errors.

1274b90dfcb3c2d6aedcb17a465c895665073702,Heme-related gene expression signatures of meat intakes in lung cancer tissues.,"Lung cancer causes more deaths worldwide than any other cancer. In addition to cigarette smoking, dietary factors may contribute to lung carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic studies, including the environment and genetics in lung cancer etiology (EAGLE), have reported increased consumption of red/processed meats to be associated with higher risk of lung cancer. Heme-iron toxicity may link meat intake with cancer. We investigated this hypothesis in meat-related lung carcinogenesis using whole genome expression. We measured genome-wide expression (HG-U133A) in 49 tumor and 42 non-involved fresh frozen lung tissues of 64 adenocarcinoma EAGLE patients. We studied gene expression profiles by high-versus-low meat consumption, with and without adjustment by sex, age, and smoking. Threshold for significance was a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.15. We studied whether the identified genes played a role in heme-iron related processes by means of manually curated literature search and gene ontology-based pathway analysis. We found that gene expression of 232 annotated genes in tumor tissue significantly distinguished lung adenocarcinoma cases who consumed above/below the median intake of fresh red meats (FDRâ€‰= 0.12). Sixty-three (âˆ¼ 28%) of the 232 identified genes (12 expected by chance, P-value < 0.001) were involved in heme binding, absorption, transport, and Wnt signaling pathway (e.g., CYPs, TPO, HPX, HFE, SLCs, and WNTs). We also identified several genes involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., NCR1, TNF, and UCP3) and oxidative stress (e.g., TPO, SGK2, and MTHFR) that may be indirectly related to heme-toxicity. The study's results provide preliminary evidence that heme-iron toxicity might be one underlying mechanism linking fresh red meat intake and lung cancer.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""T K Lam"", ids = ""145063250""); list(name = ""Melissa Rotunno"", ids = ""3797310""); list(name = ""BrÃ­d M.

ce0b7595f89c5ee5d8c8d7a6755c8ea5d44f5b8a,VEGFâ€™s Relationship to Brain Aging Biomarkers (P3.029),"Objective: Evaluate whether in amyloid positive, but not amyloid negative, participants, higher cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels would be associated with greater cortical thickness in regions susceptible to Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD)-related cortical thinning. Background: VEGF is the primary regulator of angiogenesis and has associated neuroprotective properties. VEGF levels may decline with age and AD progression. However, it remains unclear whether VEGF levels in aging adults relate to brain aging biomarkers. VEGF levels may be dependent on the presence of AD-relevant biological stressors, such as amyloid-beta (AÎ²). Design/Methods: We evaluated 241 non-demented participants from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We calculated MRI-derived surface area and cortical thickness (FreeSurfer 5.3) in the entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate, mean temporal cortex (superior, middle, and inferior temporal and fusiform gyri), and mean parietal cortex (superior and inferior parietal gyri and precuneus), grouping by their shared variance. We related these cortical thickness regions to baseline CSF VEGF levels according to amyloid status (CSF AÎ² â‰¤ 192 pg/ml; AÎ²+). We performed multiple linear regression controlling for age, sex, education, APOE 4 status, and CSF T-tau and used false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple comparisons. Results: In AÎ²+ participants, higher CSF VEGF levels were significantly associated with greater temporal cortex thickness (FDR adjusted VEGF partial p =0.027, t = 2.752, omnibus p Conclusions: Higher CSF VEGF levels were positively associated with higher mean temporal cortical thickness measurements in AÎ²+, but not AÎ²âˆ’, participants. These results may indicate that the upregulation of VEGF levels early in AD pathogenesis serves a compensatory neuroprotective role in response to AÎ² deposition. This study provides insight into how VEGF, a modifiable factor, relates to brain aging biomarkers, providing focus to future AD research and intervention efforts.

73f965990ffbbd3ded9e20285fcaf65658f27d57,Pharmacogenetics of ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.,"Aim/Materials & methods: Few studies have evaluated the influence of pharmacogenetics in psoriatic patients treated with ustekinumab. We evaluated 121 polymorphisms to study a possible association between these SNPs and the response to ustekinumab (PASI75 at 4 months; n = 69).


RESULTS/CONCLUSION
The adjusted results (false discovery rate) showed an association between five SNPs in TNFRSF1A, HTR2A, NFKBIA, ADAM33 and IL13 genes, and poor response to ustekinumab. Furthermore, six SNPs in CHUK, C17orf51, ZNF816A, STAT4, SLC22A4 and Corf72 genes were associated with better response to ustekinumab. However, there was no significant association between response to ustekinumab and SNPs in HLA-C as it has been recently described. Finally, a higher weight was obtained in nonresponders than responders (p = 0.018). Further studies would be necessary to be closer to personalized medicine.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""RocÃ­o Prieto-PÃ©rez"", ids = ""1398133716""); list(name = ""Mar Llamas-Velasco"", ids = ""1396452139""); list(name = ""Teresa Cabaleiro"", ids = ""4393798""); list(name = ""Guillermo Solano-LÃ³pez"", ids = ""1398133713""); list(name = ""Beatriz Cruz MÃ¡rquez"", ids = ""104735739""); list(name = ""Manuel RomÃ¡n"", ids = ""144600267""); list(name = ""Dolores Chinchillas Ochoa"", ids = ""145521052""); list(name = ""MarÃ­a TalegÃ³n"", ids = ""87169783""); list(name = ""E DaudÃ©n"", ids = ""3623578""); list(name = ""Francisco Abad-Santos"", ids = ""1398122978"")",c76bc1ef2a8e09153002352e3ae05bbb2277a78a; cd9070ac05d984cb37bfdb5e96bfa63f503a4138; 6ce50abf311696791d5c9c1f93e3839fa299feaf; 05f58c432c1ad207e85ebd8f785899fbd0a5a8ed; f6d93323544ccf322c5b5e56b91b9bda533225a0; 936fd4c8caee2d20372f6ce448c4a89a8dd19286; e4eacf3f7859e086bab7d52eee39ecf3e90db533; de733ded1cabe708c2701033682aee1573494ade,cb1eddc9f4f09a178193ee82122109c92fb8bc0e; 93efdbd105cab41fe18106aa2f9ef5c3ee52261a; 6eb2267f1ee2d0dc6dd5604f515a45e9abf0d656; 4c2611d65b99373a526475e32318a491725e4da1; e047f1f5bff6ff6c5906ab8db945a7f330a93105; 7a84c4e82e8a8c56e96e6ba5c110bf9ff1dad80f; ec1aad0c8cf32b999dc02340ec9ed517e8546a41; 6bbdf8509d5e3053659a4821813fbc1f215a9717; 8b061626c29c798aaacfe732c19d951bdd90d54b; ba0edf3561136e4fb41f7bec9515b1bb8898c956; 318164534e0564a9bd592a43c55a68562ec763fa; 23361c161457d4863d9b20c6069101eb946dfd6e; 40cecda82db29bb3c7dc9f8a970fb51653508504; f9a321db0411ae7f927197864f829e26eb4302c1; fd62da9a43023cc12b3d4a426dd6e2d4b0571c63; 5f13e77d6beeca77466f9fa5d2ac2a7483b74384; 36174420070cab5ffb42fb0bfddeb5b9b8d8cd4c; 67909bd657047dca7ef72d127e4ab3f3a7840e80; ecc79958d0c0c88d1f7bc07b5b7d23112a89a021; ffad7b53ff7556b3402b5bb3eca606bf64b1e389; b672652b4ccb7dc295744f3c1717e938582d9468; 77e8202d9371dd9dd7beef40d862fd5e329a5bcd; 8b55e61e7a337d5f826e242cb1d47493196f81b9; a80c902e66e92918ac66945f410dcaf0de36e0c4; de931c35c1071df3173ac4db72f14b9c7391aab8; 0092156faa99898086238b270d05efaeee88089a; c1a3aeca461aab47bb30c29cb36e55019c27edf6; 4bd67b4aa872f45ce64217e1c4fa538e62fc5836; ddc288864b7b5e855971768d69ed8c5c352ab75f; 42dbadb883459defd342459601f4016687ddb60d; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; ca5df697330a4a3cf61923d200a57c34ccebcfa6; 14d58758f01bdf8242d7e64f7c79bcad5f6bdd44; 099a545df94ae0e2d91b9ef615faa92ce37f7048; 3d0cb69e20b09f584a12a2b6bd268febcb43059a; 96531c43b5bf6fc2bbfb93d7eac6152005dd957e; 5f895b78432f3c9f579ef8ff394911f2dd2be0aa; 6f4821c03d1ffddb0cf7fef5c92692bc4ea6b1d9; c7b120863476e06a691667b55e44b669f6601d33,Pharmacogenomics,18 2,"

d70de031444d33d1222e4b30979f4b89c22f0702,Short communication: Improving the accuracy of genomic prediction of body conformation traits in Chinese Holsteins using markers derived from high-density marker panels.,"This study investigated the efficiency of genomic prediction with adding the markers identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a data set of imputed high-density (HD) markers from 54K markers in Chinese Holsteins. Among 3,056 Chinese Holsteins with imputed HD data, 2,401 individuals born before October 1, 2009, were used for GWAS and a reference population for genomic prediction, and the 220 younger cows were used as a validation population. In total, 1,403, 1,536, and 1,383 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; false discovery rate at 0.05) associated with conformation final score, mammary system, and feet and legs were identified, respectively. About 2 to 3% genetic variance of 3 traits was explained by these significant SNP. Only a very small proportion of significant SNP identified by GWAS was included in the 54K marker panel. Three new marker sets (54K+) were herein produced by adding significant SNP obtained by linear mixed model for each trait into the 54K marker panel. Genomic breeding values were predicted using a Bayesian variable selection (BVS) model. The accuracies of genomic breeding value by BVS based on the 54K+ data were 2.0 to 5.2% higher than those based on the 54K data. The imputed HD markers yielded 1.4% higher accuracy on average (BVS) than the 54K data. Both the 54K+ and HD data generated lower bias of genomic prediction, and the 54K+ data yielded the lowest bias in all situations. Our results show that the imputed HD data were not very useful for improving the accuracy of genomic prediction and that adding the significant markers derived from the imputed HD marker panel could improve the accuracy of genomic prediction and decrease the bias of genomic prediction.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hanqing Song"", ids = ""46219958""); list(name = ""Li Li"", ids = ""50703838""); list(name = ""Pei-pei Ma"", ids = ""153093161""); list(name = ""S Zhang"", ids = ""50822660""); list(name = ""Guosheng Su"", ids = ""144418694""); list(name = ""Mogens SandÃ¸ Lund"", ids = ""2469480""); list(name = ""Quanqi Zhang"", ids = ""119718573""); list(name = ""Xiangdong Ding"", ids = ""145592947"")",cecee720d68d2d81187edea685dbafe411515864; ea20279a433cc6ed91520c0699add6263f1adfec,,Journal of dairy science,101 6,"

44c5895e7f09492a637bb9a6f1427eb64398902a,Placental DNA methylation changes for the detection of tetralogy of Fallot.,"OBJECTIVES
To determine whether the methylation level of cytosine nucleotides in placental DNA can be used to predict Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and provide insights into its mechanism of development.


METHODS
The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips assay was used to measure cytosine ('CpG' or 'cg') methylation (i.e. the addition 'methyl group') levels at loci throughout the placental genome. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95% CI was calculated for TOF detection for CpG loci with significant methylation changes in TOF. False Discovery Rate (FDR) p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (QIAGEN) was used to identify gene pathways that were significantly overexpressed and thus altered in TOF compared to controls.


RESULTS
We used 8 cases of isolated TOF and 10 unaffected newborn placentas. We found a total of 166 significantly differentially methylated CpG loci: TOF versus controls, in 166 separate genes. These biomarkers demonstrated from fair up to excellent individual predictive accuracy for TOF detection, with AUC ROC â‰¥ 0.75 (FDR p-value <0.001). The following CpG loci [gene] had high predictive accuracy: cg05273049 [ARHGAP22]: AUC (95% CI) = 1.0 (1.0, 1.0), cg02540011 [CDK5]: AUC (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.87, 1.0), cg08404201 [TRIM27] AUC (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.84, 1.0), cg00687252 [IER3]: AUC (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.84, 1.0). Pathway Analysis revealed over-representation (dysregulation) of gene pathways involved in normal cardiac development. Examples include: Cardiomyocyte Differentiation via BMP Receptors, Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling, Role of NFAT in Cardiac Hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is an important feature of TOF.


CONCLUSION
Placental cytosine methylation yielded accurate markers for TOF detection and provided mechanistic information on TOF development. Our work appears to confirm a central role of epigenetic changes and of the placenta in the development of TOF. This article is protected by copyright.

2aa5f9b25ec16c4750b81c1460c63466ee9c0a0e,Is Fund Management Skill More Valuable in Noisy Times?,"Is fund management skill more valuable in noise trading times â€”a natural setting to detect skill â€” when asset prices drift from intrinsic values, short-selling is limited, and value-relevant information is costlier? Our results demonstrate that skilled fund managers generate persistent excess risk-adjusted returns especially in high sentiment and stock mispricing states. We find that fund managers with the highest (lowest) skill create, on average, $7.71 ($5.64) million of added value (loss) conditional on high sentiment periods, relative to $3.74 million for the entire sample period, while they experience a value loss of $0.18 ($30.32) million in low sentiment periods. This pattern persists after we control for lucky bias, using the â€œfalse discovery rateâ€ approach, which permits to disentangle manager â€œskillâ€ from â€œluckâ€.

Besides protein complexity, the greatest bioanalytical challenge facing comprehensive analysis of saliva samples is related to the large variation of protein relative abundances including the presence of high-abundance proteins such as amylases, mucins, proline-rich proteins (PRPs), and secretory IgA complex. Among a number of electrokinetic separation techniques, transient capillary isotachophoresis/capillary zone electrophoresis (CITP/CZE) specifically targets trace amounts of proteins and thus reduces the range of relative protein abundances for providing unparallel advantages toward the identification of low-abundance proteins. By employing a CITP/CZE-based multidimensional separation platform coupled with electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-tandem MS), a total of 6112 fully tryptic peptides are sequenced at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR), leading to the identification of 1479 distinct human SwissProt protein entries. By comparing with capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) as another electrokinetics-based stacking approach, CITP/CZE not only offers a broad field of application but also is less prone to protein/peptide precipitation during the analysis. The ultrahigh resolving power of CITP/CZE is evidenced by the large number of distinct peptide identifications measured from each CITP fraction together with the low peptide fraction overlapping among identified peptides. Furthermore, when evaluating the protein sequence coverage by the number of distinct peptides mapping to each protein identification, the CITP-based proteome technology similarly achieves the superior performance with 674 proteins (46%) having three or more distinct peptides, 288 (19%) having two distinct peptides, and 517 (35%) having a single distinct peptide.",2007,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Xueping Fang"", ids = ""11435777""); list(name = ""Li -tao Yang"", ids = ""48064520""); list(name = ""Weijie Wang"", ids = ""46314778""); list(name = ""Tao Song"", ids = ""144735988""); list(name = ""Cheng Siong Lee"", ids = ""2228425""); list(name = ""Don L.

202699385d9067367de397145454fb3e817e1c6a,Abstract 4958: Prediagnostic peripheral blood DNA methylation and lung cancer survival,"Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in cell and tissue development and differentiation, is a known mechanism of carcinogenesis, and is altered by various exposures including cigarette smoking and age. Peripheral blood methylation represents a combination of these factors as well as blood cell type distributions that reflect underlying immunophenotypes. Hematopoiesis is programmed through epigenetic changes, and blood cell type-specific methylation markers can be leveraged to â€œfingerprintâ€ cell type distributions. We examined associations between pre-diagnostic methylation markers in peripheral blood with overall lung cancer survival in very heavy smokers from the Beta Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET). CARET was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial of daily Î²-carotene and retinyl palmitate in smokers with â‰¥20 pack-years, and smokers who were occupationally exposed to asbestos. Methylation was successfully measured using the Illumina 850K EPIC BeadArray on average 5 years prior to diagnosis for 331 lung cancer cases, of whom 253 died during follow up (median survival 329 days). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the relationship between CpG-specific methylation and survival. Models were adjusted for age at blood draw, sex, race, enrollment year, placebo/active intervention, asbestos exposure, current/former smoking and time since quit, pack years, average number of cigarettes per day and histologic type, and were fit separately depending on the time between blood draw and lung cancer diagnosis: 0-3 years (n = 107), 3-5 years (n = 77), and 5+ years (n = 147). After adjusting for multiple comparisons by computing the false discovery rate (FDR) q-value, there were 1,028, 296, and 4 CpGs that were statistically significantly associated with survival (q â‰¤0.010) for samples collected 0-3 years, 3-5 years, and 5+ years before diagnosis, respectively. After controlling for blood cell type distributions, much larger numbers of CpGs were statistically significantly associated with survival: 10,481, 456, and 257, respectively. The top canonical pathways of CpGs identified in samples drawn 0-3 years prior to diagnosis included PTEN signaling (p = 1.1E-5) and PI3K signaling in B lymphoctyes (p = 3.7E-5). We observed that the number of methylated CpGs in peripheral blood that are associated with subsequent survival increases dramatically when measured closer to lung cancer diagnosis. As well, we observed that the number of methylated markers is increased by controlling for immunophenotype. Our study provides evidence that peripheral blood methylation markers measured many years prior to diagnosis may be associated with poor lung cancer survival, and that increasing changes in methylation over time may also be associated. This points to the critical role of the immune system, even prior to diagnosis, in influencing cancer outcomes. Citation Format: Jennifer A. Doherty, Xuan Zhang, Devin C. Koestler, Matt J.

d1e606dbb7e0ff6e992c92f3112839bb07ae3cc3,Creation of differentiation-specific genomic maps of human epidermis through laser capture microdissection,"TO THE EDITOR 
 
Keratinocytes change dramatically as they differentiate from the basal layer to spinous, granular, and cornified cells. This epidermal stratification is tightly controlled and essential to maintain the effective barrier function of the epidermis (Koster, 2009), but differences in gene expression and the controlling transcription factors are only partly understood. Some insights into differential gene expression have been obtained by laser capture microdissection (LCM) or cell separation methods, but in the case of LCM only selected genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (Percoco et al., 2012). Radoja et al. separated basal vs suprabasal cells by sorting based on Î²4 integrin expression and profiled genes using whole genome arrays. However, differentiation-specific genes such as loricrin and filaggrin were enriched 400-fold enrichment in loricrin and filaggrin mRNAs with whole genome mRNA arrays to broadly assess differentiation-related transcription factors and other gene products in basal vs suprabasal human epidermis. 
 
We applied LCM to normal human skin derived from three volunteers in order to isolate the following three regions: reticular dermis (as a reference), basal epidermis, and suprabasal (spinous, granular, and cornified layers) epidermis (Figure S1). We then extracted RNA from each of these regions and generated their gene expression profiles using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 arrays as described (Supplementary Materials and Methods). 
 
The transcriptional profiles of the three captured regions distinctly separated from each other by principal components analysis, with minimal deviation between the three biological replicates. As expected due to their vastly different cellular composition, the reticular dermis samples were especially far removed from the other two epidermal regions (Figure 1a). Whole epidermis captured by LCM was very similar to suprabasal epidermis but quite distinct from basal epidermis, highlighting the utility of this approach to separate out basal from suprabasal epidermis. Using cutoffs of false discovery rate (FDR) 1.5, we found 286 upregulated and 310 downregulated genes in basal versus suprabasal epidermis (raw data deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus accession number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE42114"",""term_id"":""42114""}}GSE42114). Some gene expression changes confirmed many expected differences between basal and suprabasal epidermis (Table S1, full list available on request) as well as between basal epidermis and reticular dermis (Table S2, full list available on request). For instance, keratin 5 was increased 7.7-fold in basal epidermis while filaggrin was increased 492.8-fold in suprabasal epidermis (FDR<10âˆ’4 for both). Furthermore, many genes associated with basal epidermis-resident melanocytes, such as dopachrome tautomerase and melan-A, were upregulated in basal epidermis (Table S1). In other words, many of the genes found to be upregulated in basal epidermis will prove to be melanocyte-specific and therefore these differentially expressed gene lists have the potential to improve our understanding of melanocyte biology.

Our data led to the identification of many transcription factors to our knowledge not previously localized in human skin, including regulatory factor X, 5 and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2) (Table 1, full list in Table S3). The preferential localization of transcription factors to either basal or suprabasal epidermis was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of normal human skin using antibodies specific to six identified factors (Figure 1bâ€“h). The discovery of transcription factors such as those found in this study has the potential to improve our mechanistic understanding of how cells differentiate from the basal to suprabasal layers of the epidermis. The functional role played by many of these factors remains to be determined but several of them are already known to display skin phenotypes (either related to pigmentation (Nagarajan et al., 2009) or differentiation (Steinmayr et al., 1998)) when knocked out in mouse models. Combined with our data, this suggests that these transcription factors have direct, endogenous functions in epidermal cells.

Selected transcription factors (identified through Gene Ontology term 0003700) differentially expressed between basal and suprabasal epidermis 
 
 
 
By Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, SREBF2 is predicted to be activated and account for the gene expression changes observed between suprabasal epidermis and reticular dermis (bias-corrected z-score = 2.603) but not between basal epidermis and reticular dermis, therefore suggesting that this transcription factor plays a functional role in epidermal differentiation. This view is supported by the role of SREBF2 in lipid synthesis (Harris et al., 1998) which is known to a be a function of suprabasal keratinocytes. Also, SREBF2 has been implicated in wound healing by mouse studies (Merath et al., 2011). 
 
We note that our results differ significantly with those reported by Radoja et al. Of the 596 genes we found to be differentially regulated between basal and suprabasal epidermis, only 72 were found by the Radoja et al. study (Figure S2). Two factors may account for the observed differences between studies. First, enrichment of differentiated epidermal layers is higher for LCM methods. Similar to a previous study in which loricrin and filaggrin mRNA were enhanced by 783- and 446-fold, respectively, by LCM (Kennedy-Crispin et al., 2012), we had >400-fold enrichment in suprabasal vs basal epidermis in this study. Incomplete cell separation using trypsinization techniques makes reliable recovery of granular layer keratinocytes more difficult and this presumably reflects minimal enrichment of loricrin and filaggrin by Radoja et al. Second, trypsinization/brief culture of separated epidermal cells can dramatically alter gene transcription profiles (Kennedy-Crispin et al., 2012). Another consideration is that melanocytes, located in basal epidermis, do not express Î²4 integrin and thus are aberrantly included in the suprabasal fraction by cell separation. As our study is, to our knowledge, the first to combine LCM with transcriptional profiling of different epidermal regions, it provides a unique basis of comparison for future work that will use LCM to examine specific cell populations of various disease states where the epidermis is undergoing hyperplastic or neoplastic changes.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicholas Gulati"", ids = ""37398873""); list(name = ""James G.

cb9f6f5fae553d372dbcefecb2535b8caca9d0c5,FDR Control with adaptive procedures and FDR monotonicity,"The steep rise in availability and usage of high-throughput technologies in biology brought with it a clear need for methods to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in multiple tests. Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) introduced in 1995 a simple procedure and proved that it provided a bound on the expected value, F DR â‰¤ q. Since then, many authors tried to improve the BH bound, with one approach being designing adaptive procedures, which aim at estimating the number of true null hypothesis in order to get a better FDR bound. Our two main rigorous results are: (i) a theorem that provides a bound on the FDR for adaptive procedures that use any estimator for the number of true hypotheses (m0), (ii) a theorem that proves a monotonicity property of general BH-like procedures, both for the case where the hypothesis are independent. We also propose two improved procedures for which we prove FDR control for the independent case, and demonstrate their advantages over several available bounds, on simulated data and on a large number of gene expression datasets. Both applications are simple and involve a similar amount of computation as the original BH procedure. We compare the performance of our proposed procedures with BH and other procedures and find that in most cases we get more power for the same level of statistical significance.

However, immune response data in tumor samples from patients (pts) treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors are scarce. Here, we present exploratory results of the CORALLEEN trial, which evaluated the efficacy of ribociclib and endocrine therapy in patients with high-risk Luminal B disease (Gavila et al. submitted to SABCS 2019). Methods: CORALLEEN is a randomized exploratory study in postmenopausal women with operable stage I-III breast cancer, hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2-negative and Luminal B by ProsignaÂ®. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive either 6 cycles of ribociclib (600mg; 3-weeks-on/1-week-off) plus daily letrozole (R+L) or chemotherapy (CHT): 4 cycles of AC followed by 12 doses of weekly paclitaxel. The primary endpoint is the rate of PAM50 Risk of Relapse (ROR)-low disease at surgery in each arm. Baseline and surgical specimens were also collected for stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) determination and gene expression analysis. Expression of 770 genes and 31 biological signatures were determined using the Breast360TM panel (nCounter). In order to identify genes whose expression correlated with TIL, a significance of microarrays (SAM) quantitative analysis was used with a false discovery rate (FDR) Citation Format: Nuria Chic, Blanca Gonzalez Farre, Laia Pare, Tomas Pascual, Cristina Saura, Cristina Hernando, Montserrat Munoz, Pedro Fernandez, Patricia Galvan, Xavier Gonzalez Farre, Mafalda Oliveira, Miguel Gil Gil, Pamela Celiz, Eva Ciruelos, Patricia Villagrasa, Joaquin Gavila, Aleix Prat.

844fb10ef901c5b4aa9180615ca8a4871bc084a2,The correlation between the mutation of protein kinase genes and the clinical characteristics of breast cancer progression,"It is accepted that breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease. In order to investigate BC as a group of disease sub-types, the varying clinical characteristics of BC patients must be considered. In this project a series of clinical, pathological, genetic and genomic data, retrieved from multiple data repositories, will be reviewed for selection in a large-scale meta-analysis and then categorised into 5 sub-groups (Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal, HER2 and Normal). The meta-analysis is primarily designed to ascertain if a correlation exists between the mutation of protein kinase (PK) genes and BC progression. As PK genes play important roles in regulating most cellular processes (e.g. cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis), it is no surprise that deregulated PK activity is a frequent cause of disease, and that PK genes are often oncogenes. 
 
The meta-analysis objectives are two-fold: 
1. To conduct an integrative meta-analysis of the differential gene expression of the PK gene family between clinical categories of BC progression (low vs high proliferation; luminal vs basal tissue; and grade 1 vs grade 3 tumours). Results from the meta-analysis will generate a ranked list of PK gene expression profiles observed in BC progression. 
2. Through the use of powerful bioinformatics tools and sequence analysis interfaces the ranked PK list will be used to direct investigations into the correlations between: codon usage bias; aberrant epigenetic factors; somatic mutations; and observed structural/functional changes of deregulated PK genes in different BC progression categories. 
To address these objectives a series of in silico bioinformatics experiments have been designed. A software program (MYGEO) has been specifically written for: multiple dataset download; calculation of p-values between BC progression groups; finding Q-values to control for the false discovery rate over multiple dataset comparisons; and to perform permutation testing on the ranked PK gene list; and 2D/3D sequence analysis functions for the analysis of structure/function relationships in significantly differentiated PK genes in BC progression. 
This project will benefit our understanding of the complex system of BC biology by identifying significantly deregulated PK genes in BC progression. The results will identify BC biomarkers and structural/functional locations within PK genes not yet elucidated, thus providing new directions for the development of PK inhibitors and improving the effectiveness of current BC treatment strategies.",2010,Biology,"list(name = ""Genevieve Birney"", ids = ""11295726""); list(name = ""Guang B.

cfd6007121e4e53ca72f77c9344729d40959ff2a,Serum protein profiles predict coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients referred for coronary angiography,"BackgroundMore than a million diagnostic cardiac catheterizations are performed annually in the US for evaluation of coronary artery anatomy and the presence of atherosclerosis. Nearly half of these patients have no significant coronary lesions or do not require mechanical or surgical revascularization. Consequently, the ability to rule out clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) using low cost, low risk tests of serum biomarkers in even a small percentage of patients with normal coronary arteries could be highly beneficial.MethodsSerum from 359 symptomatic subjects referred for catheterization was interrogated for proteins involved in atherogenesis, atherosclerosis, and plaque vulnerability. Coronary angiography classified 150 patients without flow-limiting CAD who did not require percutaneous intervention (PCI) while 209 required coronary revascularization (stents, angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Continuous variables were compared across the two patient groups for each analyte including calculation of false discovery rate (FDR â‰¤ 1%) and Q value (P value for statistical significance adjusted to â‰¤ 0.01).ResultsSignificant differences were detected in circulating proteins from patients requiring revascularization including increased apolipoprotein B100 (APO-B100), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), resistin, osteopontin, interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, IL-10 and N-terminal fragment protein precursor brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pBNP) and decreased apolipoprotein A1 (APO-A1). Biomarker classification signatures comprising up to 5 analytes were identified using a tunable scoring function trained against 239 samples and validated with 120 additional samples. A total of 14 overlapping signatures classified patients without significant coronary disease (38% to 59% specificity) while maintaining 95% sensitivity for patients requiring revascularization. Osteopontin (14 times) and resistin (10 times) were most frequently represented among these diagnostic signatures. The most efficacious protein signature in validation studies comprised osteopontin (OPN), resistin, matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) and interferon Î³ (IFNÎ³) as a four-marker panel while the addition of either CRP or adiponectin (ACRP-30) yielded comparable results in five protein signatures.ConclusionsProteins in the serum of CAD patients predominantly reflected (1) a positive acute phase, inflammatory response and (2) alterations in lipid metabolism, transport, peroxidation and accumulation. There were surprisingly few indicators of growth factor activation or extracellular matrix remodeling in the serum of CAD patients except for elevated OPN. These data suggest that many symptomatic patients without significant CAD could be identified by a targeted multiplex serum protein test without cardiac catheterization thereby eliminating exposure to ionizing radiation and decreasing the economic burden of angiographic testing for these patients.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""William A LaFramboise"", ids = ""5690501""); list(name = ""Rajiv Dhir"", ids = ""144736985""); list(name = ""Lori A.

Objectives: We investigated whether concentrations of circulating microRNAs differ across the hypertensive right ventricle and pulmonary circulation, and correlate with hemodynamic/echocardiographic variables in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension versus nonpulmonary arterial hypertension controls. Design: Prospective blood collection during cardiac catheterization from the superior vena cava, pulmonary artery, and ascending aorta in 12 children with pulmonary arterial hypertension and nine matched nonpulmonary arterial hypertension controls, followed by an unbiased quantitative polymerase chain reaction array screen for 754 microRNAs in plasma. Setting: Childrenâ€™s hospital at a medical school. Patients: Twelve pulmonary arterial hypertension patients included as follows: idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (5), pulmonary arterial hypertension (2), pulmonary arterial hypertension-repaired congenital heart disease (4), portopulmonary pulmonary hypertension (1). Nine nonpulmonary arterial hypertension controls included as follows: mild/moderate left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (7), mediastinal teratoma (1), portal vein stenosis (1). Interventions: Standard pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment. Measurements and Main Results: Analysis of differential concentrations (false discovery rate < 0.05) revealed two trans-rightâ€“ventricle microRNA gradients (pulmonary artery vs superior vena cava): miR-193a-5p (step-up in pulmonary arterial hypertension and step-down in control) and miR-423-5p (step-down in pulmonary arterial hypertension and step-up in control) and two transpulmonary microRNA gradients (ascending aorta vs pulmonary artery): miR-26b-5p (step-down only in control) and miR-331-3p (step-up only in pulmonary arterial hypertension). Between-group comparison revealed miR-29a-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-590-5p, and miR-200c-3p as upregulated in pulmonary arterial hypertension-superior vena cava and miR-99a-5p as downregulated in pulmonary arterial hypertensionâ€“pulmonary artery. The differential microRNA-concentrations correlated with prognostic hemodynamic variables (pulmonary vascular resistance, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, etc.). Conclusions: We identified for the first time in human disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension) trans-rightâ€“ventricle and transpulmonary microRNA gradients in blood plasma.

aa22317873f4f0679c2973b769272c760fa367fb,EWMA control chart via multiple testing,"This paper proposes a new type of multivariate EWMA control chart for detecting the process mean shift on the basis of a series of most recent T-squared statistics. We established a multiple hypothesis testing which uses the false discovery rate as the error to be controlled. Particularly, Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure is applied to develop a new control scheme. A nonparametric density estimation based on the Parzen windows is adopted to approximate the distribution of the T-square statistics, from which the p-values are calculated. The performance of the proposed control charts is evaluated in terms of the outverage run length WMA ultiple testing ultivariate control chart of-control average run length and the in-control average run length according to various non-centrality parameters associated with the mean shifts. The result shows that the proposed control chart performs better than the existing multivariate EWMA chart for all mean shifts. The proposed method seems to be rigorous in the sense that error rates for the multiple hypotheses are considered in an integrated way via FDR rather than considering type I and II errors separately.

d7c227fdd8f1c9c70294821b4983250469305457,Evidence for CD16a-Mediated NK Cell Stimulation in Antibody-Mediated Kidney Transplant Rejection,"Background Natural killer (NK) cells localize in the microcirculation in antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and have been postulated to be activated by donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies triggering their CD16a Fc receptors. However, direct evidence for NK cell CD16a triggering in AMR is lacking. We hypothesized that CD16a-inducible NK cell-selective transcripts would be expressed in human AMR biopsies and would offer evidence for CD16a triggering. Methods We stimulated human NK cells through CD16a in vitro, characterized CD16a-inducible transcripts, and studied their expression in human kidney transplant biopsies with AMR and in an extended human cell panel to determine their selectivity. Results In NK cells, CD16a stimulation induced increased expression of 276 transcripts (FC > 2x, false discovery rate < 0.05), including IFNG, TNF, CSF2, chemokines, such as CCL3, CCL4, and XCL1, and modulators of NK cell effector functions (TNFRSF9, CRTAM, CD160). Examination in an extended human cell panel revealed that CD160 and XCL1 were likely to be selective for NK cells in AMR. In biopsies, 8 of the top 30 CD16a-inducible transcripts were highly associated with AMR (P < 5 Ã— 10âˆ’6): CCL4, CD160, CCL3, XCL1, CRTAM, FCRL3, STARD4, TNFRSF9. Other NK cell transcripts (eg, GNLY) were increased in AMR but not CD16a-inducible, their presence in AMR probably reflecting NK cell localization. Conclusions The association of CD16a-inducible NK cell-selective transcripts CD160 and XCL1 with biopsies with AMR provides evidence for NK cell CD16a activation in AMR. This raises the possibility of other CD16a-triggered effects that are not necessarily transcriptional, including NK localization and cytotoxicity.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Michael D.

3383f5630d5aa0a3d4d524d20b2cc01b2237d0fe,Making Informed Choices about Microarray Data Analysis,"High-throughput methods are revolutionizing biological research, and numerous published articles describe innovative insights obtained through analysis of microarray data. Microarray technologies are now available for measuring gene expression, DNA copy number, methylation, chromatin state, protein binding, SNPs, and other aspects of gene physiology. To address the needs of many biomedical researchers who do not often have the resources to perform sophisticated data manipulation, several companies and institutions have prepared pre-packaged software to guide the researcher through and perform all the steps of standard microarray analysis. Commercial packages include Genespring, Nexus (from Biodiscovery), GeneSifter (from Geospiza), Expressionist (from Genedata), Partek Genomics Suite, and many others. Several institutional packages are described at the end of this article. With such packaged software readily available, who really needs to think about microarray analysis or to collaborate with array analysis specialists? 
 
The premise of this review is that innovative microarray analyses are rarely straightforward and that most analyses present problems and opportunities that are not readily identified or adequately addressed by packaged, comprehensive software. For example, one common problem in my experience is that common quality assessment (QA) practices may be unable to eliminate all seriously compromised chips. Furthermore, the current best practices for expression arrays don't work well for many of the new kinds of arrays (see Text S1, section S2). Certainly, commercial software has valuable uses; e.g., the quality and flexibility of commercial graphics programming for data visualization that outstrips that of open-source software. However, this review proposes a Malthusian maxim for microarrays: that the number of potential complications in high-throughput biology grows exponentially, while the expertise embodied in packaged software has grown only linearly. Thus, a researcher must know enough about high-throughput methods to ascertain when commercialized software can be helpful and when an expert in microarray analysis should be consulted. 
 
Most data analyses consist of the steps outlined in Figure 1. This review will follow these steps. The last two steps (significance tests and biological interpretation) and exploratory analysis are not covered here. A complementary approach to some of the early stages of a study was presented recently in [1].

Experimental Design 
Researchers know good data depends on good experimental design. There are several design issues that benefit from statistical thinking, but the most prominent issue is whether there will be enough samples to find most of the genes that are changed. Most researchers are aware of the multiple comparisons issue; when they perform a straightforward power calculation, they know to set the target significance threshold much lower than it would be for single tests. However, the actual level of significance one would need to detect a significant difference after standard Bonferroni multiple comparisons adjustments to the p-value would be so small that an experiment would require far too many samples to be practical. For this reason, in practice most researchers use the false discovery rate (FDR) [2] to assess significance in data analysis. It makes sense, therefore, to perform power calculations using FDR, but such a calculation is not so easy to perform. Another approach to power estimation is to make an analogy with published data to estimate the power of one's own study; such an approach is implemented in the Microarray Power Atlas ([3] and http://www.poweratlas.org). 
 
A general principle of experimental design is to make comparisons under circumstances as closely matched as possible. A second issue that has tripped up many researchers is that arrays processed at different times or by different technicians often show pronounced batch differences [4], [5]. For example, there may be different dynamic ranges in different batches, or certain subsets of probes may show greater signal independent of biological differences. Thus, it is important to try to process all the arrays under as close to identical conditions as possible, or, if that is impossible, to randomize the assignment of samples to processing times. Variations in ozone concentration make a significant difference (R. Lucito, E. Ljungstrom, personal communications; [6], [7]). 
 
In designing two-color array experiments, the most common advice is to make contrasts that are the most informative [1], [8]. Such a design helps to maximize the information available in a fixed number of arrays. For various reasons, such as flexibility in the face of hybridization failures, and in order to allow comparisons between present and possible future experiments, many experimenters choose to co-hybridize both case/treatment and control samples with a common reference sample. In keeping with the general principle in the previous paragraph, it is better not to co-hybridize samples that are expected to differ markedly, because extreme ratios of gene expression, far from one, usually have much larger errors. Therefore, if one is using a common reference, it is better to use a reference from a tissue similar to the samples under study, rather than a reference from a different tissue.",2010,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mark Reimers"", ids = ""48141323"")",d2fa7fbf5cb04f54361a600dfdd228a8949ed4d3; e66d057ac7676c3e111b83748f5c5e7d126a1f17; ea1391b1fb4341f6b0d1753dbc360293ea024605; b53bbb021928daddb1cdedf103afa3bd1255f1f2; 58c90bdf7707235c732d39ff03b32a77032d3432; 47dcab70db77af7a0c12f03dc4e571702ba60da1; 0b0458cc9e51ec78b3e85ae568f3462ed9749b9b; d770877d3caffd3ddea3c466643759a1db75823f; 64dda1ab3c1adfffbd84a1b0df51c16e44a7a073; 924fbd8885667349ba266f3131bf22d657d258f2; d6253c419574334c6b768b9cdbe1fd25c38c3769; 10110beef0e50784dd665cfa7224a482f6578749; ac317a34f80068a672e0be2c551417aceefaf7fe; 331254157e088f807b5c451b807946f6c6fbd7d2; 176fbe417644960621101b632a49b3d1dadcc749; 59b89dd0c7547009ccf9f99c1923d83e8e625dad; 0aa247445eab79d98df7689618eb4f11c48f8357; f5f370b18041944ba0f80ddbf575987a18ce2208; a9fa27945975e52742a606f591420587a87a081a; 882cf9f277659ad62551bd537c2857315ef066b1; 0de0128f94f257fa3cbdf7ce113a7fd3bb6674fd; 7b108cac9e72d9a236adb79668ab1af8fe0ad32c; a039d6426f7e00d327e68d69b86f5f34a62f6217; a85630a323ef873d4aeebef7de53e99cd470ac81; 90afad766b8eaf91d5ca247a0bbbc967dbdc5fb9; 42dfb7b36381a69b1869065ce78bf5e4181b9c29; d73ecfefe4bef92493d60fec5ba04648522bc6bc; 12e0aee9cd4e75485a9912557de7e0da2494609e; b0eaacddf63190bd7f41ba346cfbc814d5f96763; 91d5ea1dba933fdd6f97a148f013006ad102d036; 5251e7da435fe9af31ab22c62520469e54e9f0d6; ed4f0aa8a657d200e7822940fd53f445321993d5; 7db33b52e9351339685777bee336ea8bbf8b250c; 2592e5483375cdf81e6bcf879a6c1c86f5f743d4; 93c5074c4cb5a058ab0c368a73c2f297d5363fc9; 2b6ec8cde6d3c1f600e7d69637e628fde4389b16; e9a2e840e064daae23ece73233f10b156daf98f4; ce91322592f89a8af774625ced7c76fc5a77096c; 56cf69009b74a756627b752ee3cb005818e4dd6c; 82e124f29ad77080369b78c29811e55fe3c9cee5; 53d7197405048737d0e6cf0a851047c02df66eea; 474b52c14c7f51a7a2c2f1890dbfd5cf536d775e; 05ae425fa524a59549f07fbc26612ce6682c98da; 100bc165da5c8428c80342d0b2a90b2870877e7d,dfa8dc739bf7625b276c402d56d1f9784e966c76; e1741c93ebb6bdd39e44f6e35d38f652cfd58a37; b8608bff54e1cc933eead9e40c725d7933a567ff; 6e436b11eab90258229643cd47861f430f00080c; 7ed1abfa2cef6a3dae92f9cdb3a0bf8cd5868fc5; a6f8491fe0fdbc2b8c18f4e2cd89611c85be9671; 75f848dc926fbc952dc74f4e08caece6a82c6d2f; d58ee78578385ccd60e4b02069ab1213dfa0be52; dc791b8176fee4f218a960990c54946696d6f35d; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; d42337ecab378287fbcd60b42e5ceb5b67b6f59a; d1e9ad65f6f7de0e27adf4c72ba2e2ad70308a8f; e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0; 7d7c611903bd4ce9101207533a2a02629425a81a; e5b7966f47a13cece7833aa3b775f9531d1323e6; 45c7f4c906828e6668b4e22bc18d2f57cac0fdcb; 053e9a814480d56b7d08f19175d867e0c70d6cc5; 3642f8a0d46119a23e3618c899270d72a2d7042f; 41f16c04630e9e0d290f43f9809b9bd265508979; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 6328d7b3c8c57a1e29db95679eb4e2119326ce54; 4dd4734464529d7b10787b32410f6312ae28fd8b; f0c8fc8ab280846d0e4e107adc6f115bddf37200; 94942debec165b4f1aa70672edd04bf069957633; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 2323e0b4b4e6776b339fa11bf30009db8c298aaf; 5c0394a8130f4d686b4a578e5fcd895fabde498a; 01dfaf980a3c3446af81ac451e3c9ebda7691166; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 4df1ee2955b90258c8aeb25d032c71c4c21e042f; bfbd97872d955301d65bda4e9fe61ef8b3038d46; c5c94631e6caeebabfcc7f82956dd35abe70ea0a; de623ec9dbbd4cdb29925dd215cfe0c4399cdb6a; 700da77cc2379820e7eaa77dcbc67cb7d423f69b; 942b359506345e1b05dc1dca2563ea9718a98345; 2c2286e4e175de7be4ab94e21f5461449da2e498; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 720e2861b0757ec78dda65741f285e1c8c72eaf9; 3ad2bebdc12e631b8a228ae4a0bf3b11da6e43a0; 66bc5f9640ce69c3c992a7a0d6cf74ca64d8592a; 5ca1d583e53ca84287a8767b7289dbd6fc4f46ed; 8dc757cb77ed7cf42220e38b9dbe31346e801d32; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; 056e7774cd48d90dad92fbac784baa1837459aec; 1f1b3b08952c8e5206b4fd580cf3832562de20a3; 3a8e8d1f9dd48e11a14d2301a02e18f6020204ce; 350e03264858614fe42aec0ada26dbbd2a42f260; 182f77976b08d832b5cdc7debdaeacc300c8e723; e22808d0205c2e763acfa3efd86a915050601e0b; c86900fc9f326e9861adc395c7e4be93dcdb8c2c; 4ff5400de696cbc40c37145e1784d1551a92c449,PLoS Computational Biology,6,

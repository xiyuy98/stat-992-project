fc520e082b0719105a378847845039e595cc59c2,Analysis of adult cerebral cortex and hippocampus transcriptomes reveals unique molecular changes in the Ts1Cje mouse model of down syndrome.,"We investigated gene expression and functional differences between Ts1Cje mice and wild-type (WT) littermates in adult cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These two brain regions are affected in people with Down syndrome, but have not been previously molecularly characterized in Ts1Cje mice. Total RNA was prepared from the brains of 8-10-week-old Ts1Cje mice (nâ€‰=â€‰6) and WT littermates (nâ€‰=â€‰5) and hybridized to Affymetrix 1.0 ST gene mouse arrays. Differentially regulated genes were identified and used to perform in silico functional analyses to better characterize dysregulated pathways in both brain regions. Hippocampus had more significantly differentially expressed genes compared with cortex (30 vs. 7 at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 20%). We identified novel genes that were differentially regulated in adult brains, including Cyb5r1, Fsbp, Vmn2r110, Snd1 and Zhx2. Functional analyses in Ts1Cje mice highlighted the importance of NFAT signaling, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and olfactory perception via G-protein signaling. In a comparison of adult Ts1Cje and WT brains, we identified new genes and pathway differences in the cortex and hippocampus. Our analyses identified physiologically relevant pathways that can serve as targets for the development of future treatments to improve neurocognition in Down syndrome.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Faycal Guedj"", ids = ""3952381""); list(name = ""Jeroen L.

a47727555ca20fba5c1e559d399fac0b88b02e9d,Semi-parametric mixture models and applications to multiple testing,"In a multiple testing context, we consider a semiparametric mixture model with two components. One component is assumed to be known and corresponds to the distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis with prior probability p. The other component f is nonparametric and stands for the distribution under the alternative hypothesis. The problem of estimating the parameters p and f of the model appears from the false discovery rate control procedures. In the first part of this dissertation, we study the estimation of the proportion p. We discuss asymptotic efficiency results and establish that two different cases occur whether f vanishes on a non-empty interval or not. In the first case, we exhibit estimators converging at parametric rate, compute the optimal asymptotic variance and conjecture that no estimator is asymptotically efficient (i.e. attains the optimal asymptotic variance). In the second case, we prove that the quadratic risk of any estimator does not converge at parametric rate. In the second part of the dissertation, we focus on the estimation of the nonparametric unknown component f in the mixture, relying on a preliminary estimator of p. We propose and study the asymptotic properties of two different estimators for this unknown component. The first estimator is a randomly weighted kernel estimator. We establish an upper bound for its pointwise quadratic risk, exhibiting the classical nonparametric rate of convergence over a class of Holder densities. The second estimator is a maximum smoothed likelihood estimator. It is computed through an iterative algorithm, for which we establish a descent property. In addition, these estimators are used in a multiple testing procedure in order to estimate the local false discovery rate.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Van Hanh Nguyen"", ids = ""47371317"")",,,,,

Objectives The findings have been inconsistent, especially those derived from cerebral blood flow (CBF) measures. Aims To identify differences in regional CBF between patients and controls using arterial spin labeling (ASL) at rest. Methods 20 patients with major depression and 20 matched healthy controls were scanned in the morning with a pCASL-sequence at a 3 T Siemens scanner. Mean Hamilton Depression Score (21 item version) was 26.2Â Â±Â 5.7 for patients, mean Beck Depression Inventory scores were 28.9Â Â±Â 8.9. Mean age did not differ between groups (39.6 vs. 44.4 years). Whole brain voxelwise T-Tests were correct for multiple comparisons using a False Discovery Rate of qÂ  Results Mean global resting CBF was not different between groups (66.1 vs. 63.0Â ml/100Â mg/min, TÂ =Â 0.95, pÂ =Â 0.35).

73376103cebfc3de846795ac27f3c183707dc96b,Bayesian analysis of mass spectrometry proteomic data using wavelet-based functional mixed models.,"In this article, we apply the recently developed Bayesian wavelet-based functional mixed model methodology to analyze MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry proteomic data. By modeling mass spectra as functions, this approach avoids reliance on peak detection methods. The flexibility of this framework in modeling nonparametric fixed and random effect functions enables it to model the effects of multiple factors simultaneously, allowing one to perform inference on multiple factors of interest using the same model fit, while adjusting for clinical or experimental covariates that may affect both the intensities and locations of peaks in the spectra. For example, this provides a straightforward way to account for systematic block and batch effects that characterize these data. From the model output, we identify spectral regions that are differentially expressed across experimental conditions, in a way that takes both statistical and clinical significance into account and controls the Bayesian false discovery rate to a prespecified level. We apply this method to two cancer studies.",2008,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jeffrey S. Morris"", ids = ""145943396""); list(name = ""Philip J.

b1e4ac45cca728d782c2b8cd2c8a8dff5f673e61,Differentiation of the two rice subspecies indica and japonica: a Gene Ontology perspective,"Cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) is comprised of two subspecies: japonica and indica. Polymorphism levels between putative homologues were determined for genes whose japonica homologue had been classified into functional categories using the Gene Ontology (GO) system. Genes were partitioned into below-average and above-average polymorphism groups, and then the set of genes having each GO term was checked for the randomness of its distribution into these polymorphism groups using a series of False Discovery Rate (FDR) tests. The robustness of the conclusions was enhanced by employing different cutoff values and sequence samplings in the FDR tests. Significant nonrandom polymorphism distributions were found for protein-coding sequences in many GO categories. In contrast, a random distribution for nearly all GO terms was seen with intron sequences. These results were extended by measuring the nonsynonymous to synonymous codon usage ratio (dN/dS) using a permutation test, which showed that some above-average polymorphism GO categories also had a high proportion of genes with a dN/dS ratio greater than one, suggesting positive selection on these GO categories during indicaâ€“japonica differentiation. An analysis of predominant gene names in the significant GO categories divided them into four functional classes: production of defense-related compounds, cell wall, cell signaling, and transcription factors.",2006,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Mitrick A.

a79f81b36a321df4176311832702a817cbeaf54b,Multiple hypothesis testing and multiple outlier identification methods,"Traditional multiple hypothesis testing procedures, such as that of Benjamini and Hochberg, fix an error rate and determine the corresponding rejection region. In 2002 Storey proposed a fixed rejection region procedure and showed numerically that it can gain more power than the fixed error rate procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg while controlling the same false discovery rate (FDR). In this thesis it is proved that when the number of alternatives is small compared to the total number of hypotheses, Storeyâ€™s method can be less powerful than that of Benjamini and Hochberg. Moreover, the two procedures are compared by setting them to produce the same FDR. The difference in power between Storeyâ€™s procedure and that of Benjamini and Hochberg is near zero when the distance between the null and alternative distributions is large, but Benjamini and Hochbergâ€™s procedure becomes more powerful as the distance decreases. It is shown that modifying the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure to incorporate an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses as proposed by Black gives a procedure with superior power. Multiple hypothesis testing can also be applied to regression diagnostics. In this thesis, a Bayesian method is proposed to test multiple hypotheses, of which the ith null and alternative hypotheses are that the ith observation is not an outlier versus it is, for i = 1, Â· Â· Â· , m. In the proposed Bayesian model, it is assumed that outliers have a mean shift, where the proportion of outliers and the mean shift respectively follow a Beta prior distribution and a normal prior distribution. It is proved in the thesis that for the proposed model, when there exists more than one outlier, the marginal distributions of the deletion residual of the ith observation under both null and alternative hypotheses are doubly noncentral t distributions. The â€œoutlyingnessâ€ of the ith observation is measured by the marginal posterior probability that the ith observation is an outlier given its deletion residual. An importance sampling method is proposed to calculate this probability. This method requires the computation of the density of the doubly noncentral F distribution and this",2010,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yaling Yin"", ids = ""6139917"")",,eba852316bbee57005ab2600e4a2fae0a07e1a28; a099e74bcfc047a1cff5a0e18b9585aaed0ce7ff; 404b58b97be6dd11b1acc1e1535b1ac8be7a93e0; ff55acc166a94262eb6438f7945baa6c0f286344; 27547c81bfe6ea78fa1223ccc9694c11e096d6c4; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 33bda167e2c5d962a0cc7e8b4ee8deff4139e795; e584de769fd8693652736182e3a8d099e659e788; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 4880201c57d2dfc77311333096f00c174187bc87; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; cbb6ef162bfedde3f75543eb1a4f6ec3fabede4a; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; 3ccec58b345ea24b99c4326908ac11c47bbb2b57; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; c180f8a6b3f43a7d125cbcee2f4a14384304e40f; 6d2ee94678be64c1eba2c87f5da237342de49680; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e; 8dc764799971b9e1d63c5d37905f810ae01512bf; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; f72f2e51f1dd4223aa025c3b7a421a266a088b97; 1694b5e9b3a6f02130384c857c88689ce38f44dd; 83ef7c76a816c0e32d09457c17fd79614579757b; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 603151c5fd127fbdaf3b6f952f68f79823da87f6; bc37489e7173c75be152b2fcea35191c68847ab2; b11caa1dc4f418c0df00022fe81e889e5ad03995; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 366f01d579f1529c15beff2c044b7aa7e3792774; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; 6677822795fd4aecb2c2cd262f3f3a6cca65295d; f8eb301acfacabff7f4b51808f3e19b3a48546f8; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; fa3611acf748674c9e74727cf2fbf45b55648d1f; 9797e85faff24278e312a9f371608025219879ff; 4c652690f499afbce1498e21acf9409308d587eb; 6b9f7f214abbe504b8ba69be77c030eb1fc44412; 605b59279d0ecbffc48fd7e0828ba9c445ca679e; cd83d7cb482d8ca3a6cd02d620ea903caa5094c1; 9e11f10e9f483635f4f2b4a1f1cd44ac36036b11; 57525f8b3557d4c22bdced7ed55acf5b03792200; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; 04f7eb10b37138f3c1a962f8319fb60b690f8632; 142382c507a3a002a796b2395b005e82d0dae471; 35d570680920326ff227da6b315db07406b72554; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; b6b88f1d8c9bb7034460aa2899ac382cfda528a2; c7f2953f68c198d7dd4912f301ac3e8bb9652e16; 3a00fd37ea0800bddf255722e691af52d41b72de; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 098930d2a35512b4596be1787646dfa282bf938b; 26155bb0743237249f6cda15dd96df6ec464635e; d60607f4c936a83d3823d1dd3b575370ff7fbe3c; d1568374570ab8b5109fa52659b9ff4a115e6034; c4cd210b2af4ad4badcdff87b63b3b9be6c1f8c2; bf1bbbc0a6c24c102d327d6a195fb6f946570983; 906ed11d6431ff32e90476c0acade160ab1c9a70; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 2e27e8e3abcacfafa8d5a77cc999205eb00ff5e3; d49b166f8c11dabebedb85339d8b8620af18efc4; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 18de1aed7d017448d163a5865dbf6ef60fa38a55; 2ea6a81dd9f71d18eee39fb057eaf5288d91976d; 1f1b750baf5b0fa427c5b38379cdcc8d70634d36; 8d76672d52622d9c45014d630717ce911d1292ba; 00b066326a8b7f0465b0199faeb2bd09289f2a7e; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; 88fe5cfa95c7a0be4756e87361391f937950b011; 44ad82804c2acab9e305de3933a78c59108de02c; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; ab71c410e61fbf90035741ae85c902ea85234354; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; e952633c79cf88bfcebdee83ab2fd81b7430a482; b52a06a1f29623a631e94de4ae9a4a9a8f0fb012; 977a61f5b31aef34499caae9da079d79dc1d13a2; 7cae14836295b4dc43bbc66e7295658d9d4932d4; 1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0; 3d811d1aa2ffb7b3d4b443c2206e6376665ca832; fe5ed74e352dc8e84200e9a715f8924817183942; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44,,,
fe7cde06c4af9b58915f9f675156adef60297ec2,Exhaustively Identifying Cross-Linked Peptides with a Linear Computational Complexity.,"Chemical cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry is a powerful tool to study protein-protein interactions and protein conformations. Two linked peptides are ionized and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum. In such an experiment, a tandem mass spectrum contains ions from two peptides. The peptide identification problem becomes a peptide-peptide pair identification problem. Currently, most tools do not search all possible pairs due to the quadratic time complexity. Consequently, missed findings are unavoidable. In our previous work, we developed a tool named ECL to search all pairs of peptides exhaustively. Unfortunately, it is very slow due to the quadratic computational complexity, especially when the database is large. Furthermore, ECL uses a score function without statistical calibration, while researchers1-3 have proposed that it is inappropriate to directly compare uncalibrated scores because different spectra have different random score distributions. Here we propose an advanced version of ECL, named ECL2. It achieves a linear time and space complexity by taking advantage of the additive property of a score function. It can search a data set containing tens of thousands of spectra against a database containing thousands of proteins in a few hours. Comparison with other five state-of-the-art tools shows that ECL2 is much faster than pLink, StavroX, ProteinProspector, and ECL. Kojak is the only one that is faster than ECL2, but Kojak does not exhaustively search all possible peptide pairs. The comparison shows that ECL2 has the highest sensitivity among the state-of-the-art tools. The experiment using a large-scale in vivo cross-linking data set demonstrates that ECL2 is the only tool that can find the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) passing the false discovery rate/q-value threshold. The result illustrates that the exhaustive search and a well-calibrated score function are useful to find PSMs from a huge search space.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Fengchao Yu"", ids = ""2898242""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""143940305""); list(name = ""Weichuan Yu"", ids = ""38549423"")",48968588a0af26306ac01c7382193f1359cd2d54; ce9c4d21ac2335368e70a327e2cdd7f42d2b0b99; 6dbb18f6220537570581fdacc882e1f0d9f8cc1d; fbbc0ec2121fbddc46b5930a0a439b6f2414b4e8; 99c66e19ef236d4bb56515b34d930742be15fc03; 0596f8c0e8d83f3942232b4cf1afcb0bb33ee2c7,69dd19a43c9112d8365f6e8c90a6eeee0eafa349; 5c49743f50ab4a4577cd098f56bcb9dd443fc24d; 3dec9156722f58775a7de0781f333c37f62a6dd1; 8270409069017c9597fa5a4a2315f108ae93cfca; 1936b1a962a72f99d29d01ab1d6c650aac1519d9; 2c03084390ab3e102d501c3d7fae01c2c2e71f63; 85bf572c5faec8e8ff422892130b996c2b0a1c7b; 4f94d90e2558511101f3470052547a1a9662c468; 2a62b04461f9e01fb2d159e678659cd06a89a267; 7d48dcefb51e49116326bb99a0c4d59dc0e58997; 480f791f6d6b6f51e844ce2a59c3a67511e30e54; 452f510d80653be529ffcd2408f2a31df8cb85a0; 36522079e6a659a5ef0d831a873fc6e374028c5d; 0d7ee3f200a044b594606c9067bbcd1638ec32e3; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 54c31f9d122271ada312ee35eef9771b2a075e1f; b173d710be4defffe374093def0b4657bd6d7b20; 8233bfb3051ea6e9547af157f4d4995657da115c; 0feacf3c462968fcdb4c675d077443330aba826c; 192aa8f561360c1078981cc8cec4cb809b940515; efa33db3f186c7801f738c6dd251f19a51415e87; 9f654a6194bd73767f19fc694e8e913b1ad5fbd8; a4935c4283eaced5c52c3dda98e7e3c4590b4de2; b9dffb82bf70fb36b78b42e34d284c46d7a8a1f7; 784d5c09cafeaea5a8d269827ce0906c370920d3; f09d4a533a221b9b85c591ba1dc862dd2fe808a1; cdacb9d12b93a0c55e9ced5524b72ec719a71082; 16e8e4fcd91e87834205f6f550e3f45c14b11390; 75e069eff49c89cd73365fd5acbcbe3cce28fae8; e0e48c3754dd1850561b2ba598d5a75259baa357; 22ebba6fb27fa6978bcda41193d48e1205193f16; 0adaa961125872b167e07984a3f906a84b6c3355; 2f110fbf461a5b5d8984fbae7f6d00daa7fe0413; 427f417dba8d6b16ea372e28f129fc517f769fb4; e8ef66e88860d7fd8004db226c653edfc4c67be6; a3df6588a84ee06fe1c9653040e44eede03edc32; ca278a4cd769721bb148f9fcc9d6e34446b090e4; a7a581f7f052570fa099dcb887b9934617760791; b4ec761012ef5674c8a2f4d234d4b6991948f17f; 89dcddec20bf68c609eaa843065c727a22dadaae; d84b42584aa17f31ce1281af81a56b59249df180; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 6fbcc7c0260a409dea7f118395c11a8d0ac51297; 05cd6287f4f48ecab4609a7ee447f04b1ac05ab3; 0d7ba2f3111674bc3957d51188768b76387a2f1a; 1458943019d76ed6019d7d4bd91da262a0b29f0b; 72ea65e7b53e3566a655cbeba45044dd526cbe20; cbef3c33739f207c010a88ddb7e7c69333b0d9e8; e45a8d7176bd738c1e63de1f6791a88e704f8b4b; 26b2280e6b18007685d30158d8b85582d06f1626; 9f8e9fc4fadf4123ffa470db0cf0790437103567; 47f664efe54f7d4c76ad9542b90f2476c0d0b2b6; a5a24e4aa0434727ed33774b999e575db08a2a81,Journal of proteome research,16 10,"

e8fc20701eafab082555ca557f70a16e53da0121,Omega-3 Fatty Acids Responsive Proteins and Reduction in Breast Density in Obese Postmenopausal Women.,"We reported that breast density (BD) was inversely correlated with the plasma level of DHA in postmenopausal obese, but not in non-obese, women given Lovaza (n-3FA). To identify protein biomarkers for the possible differential effect of n-3FA on BD between obese and non-obese women, an iTRAQ method was performed to analyze plasma from obese and lean women at each time point (baseline, 12 and 24-months, n=10 per group); 173 proteins with >95% confidence (Unuses Score >1.3 and local false discovery rate estimation <5%) was identified. Comparative analysis between various groups identified several differentially expressed proteins (hemopexin precursor, vitamin D binding protein isoform 1 precursor [VDBP], fibronectin isoform 10 precursor [FN] and alpha-2 macroglobulin precursor [A2M]). Western blot analysis was performed to verify the differential expression of proteins in the iTRAQ study and those found to be altered in a tumor protective fashion by an n-3FA rich diet in our previous preclinical study; gelsolin, VDBP and FN were altered by n-3FA in a manner consistent with reduction in inflammation in obese women. To test the impact of our findings on breast cancer risk reduction by n-3FA, a post-hoc analysis revealed that n-3FA administration reduced BD selectively in obese postmenopausal women.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yuan-Wan Sun"", ids = ""66166447""); list(name = ""Haifang Xu"", ids = ""7271288""); list(name = ""Gabrielle Benitez"", ids = ""20496629""); list(name = ""Kun-ming Chen"", ids = ""50053537""); list(name = ""Anne Stanley"", ids = ""37580004""); list(name = ""Bruce A.

d7196b85c947527fd9de8396f4869c9f4b8c8c1b,Condition-dependent coexpression in Arabidopsis and the bootstrap estimation of false discovery rate,"Condition-dependent coexpression in Arabidopsis and the bootstrap estimation of false discovery rate Hui Lan Doctor of Philosophy Graduate Department of Computer Science University of Toronto 2015 Conventional coexpression analysis looks at gene expression levels over diverse conditions. Although such â€œcondition independentâ€ analyses provide useful generalized information, the coexpression of genes can depend on biological context. Looking at gene coexpression in a condition-dependent fashion identifies gene interactions relevant to more-specific biological questions. This thesis addresses condition-dependent coexpression in the context of seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana. We study two broad aspects of the problem: (i) detecting pairwise interactions, and (ii) detecting three-way interactions. First, using gene expression data gathered exclusively from mature seeds, we develop a coexpression network, SeedNet. We analyze its statistical properties and find, for example, that SeedNet bifurcates into two previously undescribed components, one corresponding to germination and one to non-germination. Second, we develop a detector for three-way interactions in gene expression data and demonstrate its efficacy. In this approach, the coexpression of a pair of genes can depend on the expression level of a third gene. That is, coexpression is conditioned on the transcriptional environment. Because of the vast number of possible three-way interactions, there is an extremely large potential for false positives, so it is crucial to accurately estimate the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We show that extending approaches used for two-way interactions can significantly underestimate the FDR of three-way interactions. The thesis develops and evaluates a new approach for estimating FDR based on the bootstrap. We show that the bootstrap approach produces reasonable estimates over a wide range of statistical conditions, whereas conventional approaches rapidly break down. Finally, we use our detector and FDR estimates to add over 64,000 new, highly-confident edges to SeedNet.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Huiyao Lan"", ids = ""145740852"")",,da4a31c6199af11025dd7cd4658e4c568d3e6852; 7eae4b193d0319ea27119fe5bea4c0be3de0d00a; eda188c864a9f5039220382cf11fbc089a0fc6c8; a99b5323a9c1a6d17af51820b37716f956d4b588; fc65ff691b74683b4fb445ac8c8f07d58dced5a3; 64d3d75e659b2a10c51f332b3d5ea9b43496a6b6; 563487187890d7cad67cc36672b30de7243bf18e; 86ed57be72a2d5db5f5e9d81abcca11741c9b33b; 617a11b18b5cc29cd377054e37769a1fd35b112f; 2459b894c4c1179c5f27f432e4a9f0fbec34c5f4; 4023f78148820ed636d755f9b5efd67c5aa79b5d; d5ed576effa823c176c54c935cdb97496095c32a; 1e75260dc4eecd78432fa9eec5f9f7db604c2280; 29bf0f96b3c3aedcdaa81fa182702125047d0048; d850e2d77b69b0e7b74a9ac111ebf67773fcb135; 35993ef876f8a398b3e857638d349a33961f3cd1; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 504a3712a86031a193e134821506636e3e0285fa; 569764e8f4e96d5313ba8763ae2a5ad9ed0feeb3; 0b3208bf66a4ad6c4891d2d801c746f8c88c3639; 9c1c4d1d5ef82f4b934f732183869c7109d01aa6; c43d72bc820e8252d7edea93a72d835af0090164; a566062069263cd5f53ca7af2b96675c8d0dace0; 549f4e727dff05af04b508a615f5cb725a72def9; 13fadf1f0d410d5a91be56a1cf0fd4a428756369; 32f644d94689bd235c2c29c22d8848817053cb38; b3e1705716a12a2cea281dbd4bab6aa13b6d8b87; 10f9184ff9ff3790170e9795ffcd8c37b8ed9016; ad6a6e8f8b9d9ff23bbad359466d14695116eb62; 85707dc3f19a4977f71e6eebb66a5b6785e67a8e; 0ba625982f4d964d82cb690914096812b0c8dd65; 5e4d852818f663c23d12b801d9212c7a248a8b27; aa1e2309127d9af911ab600f7a3165d0fb4bf6a6; cbccfc50845a88501b1d9da59a35b200ee230ff9; ec3946019857f53ee084f9ff3349d4615e501510; 62c588685f7e0ff90f2278b09edf30098340ed06; 062198029118066adcc98aad075cc62c256d0e90; bc2194c8850fc70481b86107237e7bbdf50b9efd; 447bf5cace7f83b588ee28b63d20eff6609bf0ff; f50443e78df7a3eeddff902ae9727dbbb8ac11e1; dbe4c1b17402cb403bfd0ba3c9d1d230074ca2a5; 0b55fcb92893242555655b8558536f10d6626eda; 48be0d4e0dd69ef820139c492c4339dd6e96f306; 229440ef17ec553f97383417ef7b31acbc7ed385; 8e448ece3e78be2fe90e9c326d65f6bc64fe482f; 6b88a46d6e94a4addb3cd469c5fd2382c68eec54; dd854e076850f4e84ddebe6afd1db3e3fa035548; 8a5329acdae6e2ec4795b2218840ca2d569b3e77; 26bceb9568dc3fd034c077d3c9416f70ca978808; 0047960129bec9fa5f72673a44e6ac653afbd0d6; d444d521a3f31fe70c56de868ebebe1e879e0d73; 2f58848d50441502a03ac7d4a98d9d5c4e8034d0; 95685567f123c3b2d2de17b22d1b2825bb92e9f3; fd42902820a1544e35680569f98badf93fdb7ebc; cedcfa486a22985ef7f72c15b5a943fe91dec0d5; 39dae53515afb42664369c291ec6d1ce34d778bd; f50a61d5d3489efb59eb6a8023874a30105fe56f; 61f5765d909efacdc7b82632b4b00c6d380b35d4; 50653fb6bd083e69d6e08e5914a6868be4688077; e8ed956ce6a454ffb74a915f02280799eb1f133a; 14f5af5f33d59567694592502288fbe14e9e9b8e; 951e787774616197c8fb39605e1bc2ed4d6b9161; c3e4d7de56fbc43c80aca3d7429a384663c8e6cf; 2595842827e0f149df0c5bfc9112a9f10b302788; d8be974bd6a78c3d5d3cf3b21563495b38f660a8; b61589f6660a9a4f22a8628142c9e15b3371055b; 77e4039ebfa4bba4ab4de7947df45b2dbc6ee8fe; 14db6be2f49288ff55792b3bc16ee2eaaf2c9724; 614689421127b8e72e96e5699375fd191c7cdfcb; e1b50842a25611e53ad8db1fc7d8b757da6641c1; 467e4414d60bf5bd36e9cdabd7a49448a45f297d; ba48376ada8223f6e07f5f3f25fc2c9ba83441d4; d6837c09b23e3e94ec00eff138bc2a21713a6eca; ea65551002d27384d50c3fe360d6b6c432c4ece5; 40cfde1298c922bf3eede03b6fb2f9a2ee72112c; c156c77fd2683501c6e9640a92361600a54e6afd; 1221b17668f5776d41fb374e9df0449ad8f0e53d; f60a3592f480160f5cbfd5248661db7e52c411ba; dd79147b1562b37a5393aaf26ad86f4188444d45; 895a183572600ed0623f3f01b9bde38c63921d9e; 6075227fc5ffe5af7e1c761b90c8747182e2b66c; 17bcdc45f7abb253e127bc53d0c97afca0a23682; 72d37fe8fa4b453bded018ca2b7ee6e21f80d723; 11e77315e127fa7196173cfa8296ebe0de83f026; d53e809571ec1fcced7581f72e87b6dac232ee92; 4cc8318525c8127e10cb1f6ff3ea8fa24c283da2; 1f5811a209600f60cb98fb9b7c98270e3025dca9; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; a8545f8060cbc292ca800cdeeb4545b8f08f2b23; 2f1e11284b1743fd81e8df7046e48452384fa91f; eeffb99052f6d90f0700dcced1489b181a6853f8; f59882c671b20abd88b77b088b51e8b304ed8351; 8ff265adb3bfd54bd694296562088f6cceb43472; 92135a6d12a6f111397b3f451ed39eb3006d3d83; 015c68fa57485058bd9cb1663b1c0a365aad884e; ffc15abfaf51841f7e222e4eb91b522824d92867; 69639d76ea74d7573f455539e9b356b675c626e0; 61d139c39d0842d32c4a01adbaf21f10030777c0; 7688fa460b72d2304841492e08a1db644f287b75; b0e2bceed8a2dfaab148a630ce26b9b39fd2ae00; e50573b554cfa9ee77dcc2e298d7073a152b7199; e96b9841965caf7b42e47eea510f6a634994a22a; fd54652a813e44ef788d6151824f2de22834f4ad; 680a793fefa138ddb6c4086b3a5e1c5a525697e2; e8c7d714594426023c3551b8f0b60a9b14b02425; d6d78aa597db22f584ee0ee9c0ff0d3ae70f4e20; e5280fd05cea22f833c89f932f284441297b7c87; 8cc03c8ad6b2645d3b5973397dc25122a29c5560; 4fb78789f4baac06759c1fe6e92f673ebbe44e4d; 93219db6330fd79612a69a3350b851109312758f; 34b1dfe73bc7830409bcedbef916675336d99746,,,
798ddc9b4d5d357c23c5bc26d3709089b5eef832,Su1160 Expression of ATOH1 in Development of Barrett's Esophagus in Rats,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation by RNA interference. They are critical regulators in many biologic functions, including gastrointestinal development and immune mediated diseases. There is currently nothing known regarding miRNA-regulated gene expression in Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE). EoE is a chronic allergen-mediated disorder of the esophagus characterized by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal epithelium. Complications include significant morbidity from feeding aversion, food bolus impaction, esophageal stricture and spontaneous esophageal perforation. Several pathogenic pathways have been described in EoE, the majority of which relate to Th2 cellmediated activation of epithelial cell inflammatory signals, eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus and epithelial damage. In light of the widespread function of miRNA, we hypothesize that miRNA expression is altered in EoE and contributes to disease pathogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Esophageal biopsies were collected from pediatric subjects at time of upper endoscopy. RNA was isolated from 6 subjects with EoE (â‰¥20 eos/hpf, endoscopic appearance consistent with EoE, and upper GI symptoms) and 6 matched controls. The miRNA expression profile of each sample was assessed using a direct hybridization platform. The Significance Analysis of Microarrays was used to detect differences in gene expression based on criteria of false discovery rate 1.5. Alterations in miRNA levels were validated by direct quantitative PCR and validated in a larger cohort. RESULTS: Twelve miRNAs were identified to be up-regulated and 2 miRNA were down-regulated in EoE compared to controls. MiR-21 was one of the most highly up-regulated (4.3 fold change) and miR-375 was the most down-regulated (5.9 fold change). The results of the large-scale platform were confirmed by qPCR. Several of the identified EoE-associated miRNAs, including miR-21, are implicated in other Th2 mediated disorders including allergic asthma and psoriasis.

We demonstrate that for samples of limited complexity, spectra-based estimation of false discovery rates will lead to overprediction of confidently identified phosphorylated peptides due to a bias caused by multiple fragmentation of highly abundant peptide species. We further provide evidence that fragmentation of abundant peptides at the tails of their chromatographic peaks is a major source for false positive peptide matches and that overall confidence in phosphopeptide identifications can be improved by a chromatographic peak-based aggregation scheme, intensity rank-based neutral loss and optimized mass error filters. When replicate runs of a standard sample were performed using different fragmentation techniques on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer we observed improvements of 7-31% in phosphopeptide coverage depending on the fragmentation method and the desired false discovery rate.",2010,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Mikhail M.

The slightest change in fermentation parameters can reduce the secretion of necessary enzymes to degrade cellulosic biomass. Determining the ecological effects of certain key media components is essential to understand how bacterial species will respond in a fluid environment. For our experiment a cellulosic media was designed to enhance the industrially important thermophile, Bacillus licheniformis YNP5-TSU. After several attempts to simplify the carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) media composition, impaired biofilm maturation and cellulase activity was noticed. This negative artifact occurred only when magnesium sulphate was removed from media. To analyze the shift in gene expression caused by magnesium stress, biofilm associated proteins were extracted from both control (4.0 mM MgSO4) and magnesium depleted (0.0 mM MgSO4) media at 24 hr and 48 hr incubation periods. These proteins were quantified through isobaric labeling and raw data generated from nanoLC-MS/MS identified over 2,000 proteins from the Bacillus licheniformis YNP5-TSU proteome (NCBI accession number MEDD00000000). After statistical normalization and false discovery rate were calculated, a total of 161 proteins from magnesium depleted media and 238 proteins from control media were deemed statistically relevant. A closer look through STRING interconnected webs, data mining, and NCBI annotations revealed several up/down regulated proteins that had linkage to biofilm formation and cellulase secretion. In this study we are able to provide significant evidence that; (1) biofilm maturation and cellulase production are highly correlated and (2), their optimization is dependent on the expression of several key proteins.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Joshua A.

7fb9b63873aecddf5ee354e82fdec28bec23ef72,iDEG: A single-subject method for assessing gene differential expression from two transcriptomes of an individual,"Background: Accurate profiling of gene expression in a single subject has the potential to be a powerful precision medicine tool, useful for unveiling individual disease mechanisms and responses. However, expression analysis tools for RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data require replicate samples to estimate gene-wise data variability and make inferences, which is costly and not easily obtainable in clinical practice. Strategies to implement DEGSeq, DESeq, and edgeR for comparing two conditions without replicates (TCWR) have been proposed without evaluation, while NOISeq-sim was validated in a restricted way using qPCR on 400 transcripts. These methods impose restrictive assumptions in TCWR limiting inferential opportunities. Methods: We propose a new method that borrows information across different genes from the same individual using a partitioned window to strategically bypass the requirement of replicates per condition. We termed this method iDEG, which identifies individualized Differentially Expressed Genes in a single subject sampled under two conditions without replicates, i.e., a baseline sample (unaffected tissue) vs. a case sample (tumor). iDEG transforms RNA-Seq data such that, under the null hypothesis, differences of transformed expression counts follow a distribution and variance calculated across a local partition of related transcripts at baseline expression. This transformation enables modeling genes with a two-group mixture model from which the probability of differential expression for each gene is then estimated by an empirical Bayes approach with a local false discovery rate control. To compare the performance of iDEG to other methods applied to TCWR, we conducted simulations assuming a Negative Binomial distribution with varying dispersion parameters and percentages of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Results: Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that iDEGs F1 accuracy scores better than the other methods at 5% 90% and recall>75% and low false positive rate (",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Qike Li"", ids = ""2266420""); list(name = ""Samir Rachid Zaim"", ids = ""30517233""); list(name = ""Dillon Aberasturi"", ids = ""67135941""); list(name = ""Joanne Berghout"", ids = ""48056394""); list(name = ""Haiquan Li"", ids = ""2733937""); list(name = ""Francesca Vitali"", ids = ""145844065""); list(name = ""Colleen Kenost"", ids = ""49005441""); list(name = ""Helen Hao Zhang"", ids = ""153504839""); list(name = ""Yves A.

8e141acbca9d061b7a940b4ffa7d219240abe2af,Information-theoretic Probability Combination with Applications to Reconciling Statistical Methods,"The analysis of biological data often requires choices between methods that seem equally applicable and yet that can yield very different results. This occurs not only with the notorious problems in frequentist statistics of conditioning on one of multiple ancillary statistics and in Bayesian statistics of selecting one of many appropriate priors, but also in choices between frequentist and Bayesian methods, in whether to use a potentially powerful parametric test to analyze a small sample of unknown distribution, in whether and how to adjust for multiple testing, and in whether to use a frequentist model averaging procedure. Today, statisticians simultaneously testing thousands of hypotheses must often decide whether to apply a multiple comparisons procedure using the assumption that the p-value is uniform under the null hypothesis (theoretical null distribution) or a null distribution estimated from the data (empirical null distribution). While the empirical null reduces estimation bias in many situations [1], it also increases variance [2] and can substantially increase bias when the data distributions have heavy tails [3]. Without any strong indication of which method can be expected to perform better for a particular data set, combining their estimated false discovery rates or adjusted p-values may be the safest approach. Emphasizing the reference class problem, [4] pointed out the need for ways to assess the evidence in the diversity of statistical inferences that can be drawn from the same data. Previous applications of p-value combination have included combining inferences from different ancillary statistics [5], combining inferences from more robust procedures with those from procedures with stronger assumptions, and combining inferences from different alternative distributions [6]. However, those combination procedures are only justified by a heuristic Bayesian argument and have not been widely adopted. To offer a viable alternative, the problem of combining conflicting methods is framed herein in terms of probability combination. Most existing methods of automatically combining probability distributions have been designed for the integration of expert opinions. For example , [7], [8], and [9] proposed combining distributions to minimize a weighted sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences from the distributions being combined, with the weights determined subjectively , e.g., by the elicitation of the opinions of the experts who provided the distributions or by the extent to which each expert is considered credible. Under broad conditions, that approach leads to the linear combination of the distributions that is defined by those weights [7, 9]. Such linear opinion pools also â€¦",2012,,"list(name = ""David R.

Most of the current popular tandem mass spectrometers have the capability of resolving the primary structures (monosaccharide composition, sequence and linkage) of N-glycans; however, compositions or putative structures have mostly been reported so far. Identification and visualization tools of N-glycans are needed.


METHODS
The isotopic mass-to-charge ratio and envelope fingerprinting algorithm, which has been successfully used for intact protein database search and identification, was adapted for N-glycan database search, and a stand-alone N-glycan database search engine, GlySeeker, for automated N-glycan identification and visualization was developed and successfully benchmarked. Both pseudo 2D graph and one-line text formats with one-letter symbols for monosaccharides were proposed for representing N-glycans. N-glycans were identified with comprehensive interpretation of product ions and false discovery rate (FDR) control.


RESULTS
In a database search of reversed-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC/MS/MS) datasets of the N-glycome enriched from OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells, with FDR â‰¤1% and number of best hits (NoBHs) = 1-30, 1525Â N-glycans with comprehensive primary structural information (composition, sequence and linkage) were identified and visualized; among these 1525Â N-glycans, 559 had NoBHs = 1, i.e. their structures were uniquely identified. This represents a large-scale identification and visualization of N-glycans with primary structures from tandem mass spectra.


CONCLUSIONS
A stand-alone N-glycan database search engine called GlySeeker has been developed for large-scale identification and visualization of N-glycans with comprehensive interpretation of tandem mass spectra and FDR control.",2018,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kaijie Xiao"", ids = ""3134673""); list(name = ""Yue Wang"", ids = list()); list(name = ""Yun Shen"", ids = ""46724506""); list(name = ""Yuyin Han"", ids = ""27995903""); list(name = ""Zhixin Tian"", ids = ""2678586"")",55230952e87d54ef6e84421b250195bb3ef0c188; 9d652cbb2da0e2be3b3b2eaf823e2db67d6be240,,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,32 2,"

However, little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms in this disorder. We aimed to investigate the altered patterns of regional synchronization and functional connections in hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) patients with and without MHE using both regional homogeneity (ReHo) and region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity (FC) computational methods. Methods: Data of magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected from 30 HBV-RC patients with MHE, 32 HBV-RC patients without MHE (NMHE) and 64 well-matched controls. Several regions showing differences in ReHo after one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were defined as ROIs for FC analysis. Next, post hoc t-tests were applied to calculate the group differences in ReHo and FC (false discovery rate (FDR) correction, p < 0.05). Correlations between clinical variables and the altered ReHo and FC were then assessed in patient groups. Results: Across three groups, significant ReHo differences were found in nine ROI regions mainly within the visual network (VN), dorsal attention network (DAN), somatomotor network (SMN), fronto parietal control (FPC) network and thalamus. Compared with healthy controls (HC), the MHE group exhibited abnormal FC mainly between the right calcarine (CAL.R) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG.L)/right thalamus. The MHE patients showed increased FC between the MFG.L and CAL.R compared to NMHE patients. Disease duration of MHE patients was positively correlated with increased mean ReHo values in the right fusiform gyrus (FFG); psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) test scores were negatively correlated with increased FC between MFG.L and CAL.R and positively correlated with reduced FC between the CAL.R and THA.R. For NMHE patients, the mean ReHo values in the right frontal pole were positively correlated with disease duration and positively correlated with the PHES scores. Conclusion: Our results exhibited that the functional brain modifications in patients with and without MHE are characterized by compound alterations in local coherence and functional connections in the VN, SMN, DAN, FPC networks and thalamus by using a combination of ReHo and ROI-based FC analysis. These functional imaging changes are correlated with disease duration/PHES. This study helped us gain a better understanding of the features of brain network modifications in cirrhosis.",2018,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Qing Zhen Sun"", ids = ""50655565""); list(name = ""Wenliang Fan"", ids = ""3917896""); list(name = ""Jin Ye"", ids = ""46376753""); list(name = ""Ping Han"", ids = ""46452898"")",acfb0883ac74d79536303201383f986aa74e7c92; 5c136ef3fec0a20672af7b3c9596050ac3a97697; 787c27d472946be13863dc9d20e34b0477877c4d; 8c483dfa1bc3e7594e89de25746c1788cf1d38cf,935e6732e1ca587faaf79e923519fbe06c0be9e5; 37c48f9ed1d0b31575c6be39f257a8487c0a014e; 6c64889a707a15702f0abb047be5cd14d8a3dfb4; 9f7ec11e2812b0904bf5e17896f81e7f14a5b0a0; 34318cbd1e05108dc47d38dcaff19ed055fa4271; 2397d2dca28a7b26944a83090d1085d78f233c10; 53e66b6934516a9859573f4866f81f04bce977ae; 070ec1baa4d74fe63b7c6c450487e851e2523a36; 0da80498b59ddc2e917514349a1e3c2cd68f983c; e70f6ad19fd42861902a6983ec687515e03c755c; 3e86e4345e1695c2f4eec832788ab7cadab753b1; 95f27d39c98dd9861a82fb74197304989fae5a5d; 5d0e38709f1097c164b1b37cbd50ca330d233389; b4497215d607f73f27b3cfda7bb7c217983f104a; 87ba4870275da044db1e03c1c019c4e338a2a680; d1ea37260aca3638fc55672028cc77ed09030e65; 56b24163145eee17c293965c4f893fd66c2af3f5; db55b3c2e9b62c4cfe86e1979b555a1c178811fc; c72804b4f98d16c5b5a46715af5de9cefe788d2a; d6d8e60cfedb683680753c0fa6904cdcf43f5338; e170ea7f7e3036b6895a5f291aa220dc0a88afa7; 52ea763324629ae2cb5ccc3f540a4608494dca2d; 3ea4c580c241ab8cda60bfbff2cddb6dbbb1c3ed; 48265726215736f7dd7ceccacac488422032397c; c03861d90fd46aa967d537704fc151b1495745b1; 2d71da6d8a0431d183e547316594de8b6ff22637; 3b590bc395341ce16a2b9a347971dd9ae0af2bb7; c1f918e71b10766ab4baa70b001cf20f93340c14; f57847db4410554ca2b6cd2597d2579eacf913de; 126913d7e19bf80ea31f20172cd7629e8728a287; aab08324da7801457d4603e281ab0024595e9983; 5b869f3eec2279c70e668b564d9b312d02169cda; 63a0743392e04a8005c88cdd873d1bff849d161d; 1bec64ee76db4979b98efe6da8dc4e776903ac95; 0abedb6edc82fc50194f7fa18fb7e0bd4dcc9157; 28949abe17031078177852e04afda992ef8577c5; 026513743012231e11914b8b8ac97c0c7f0d6000; 5cebbb6df33114b2496980acfcad92a73777564d; 02c51d8fcf19b623d602134a9f012c033152e375; f247aadb6b6f03a620d195b93463ebe68681a708; 90a46a77bb3f45ab8969ae0c4fae4d11047b0078; 51067ff05f84b8390abd40e5b2f4c3679c3ebcd0; aecb234e8eb98f2c2d27ddfce896ad8dddd848fb; ef43e96666884c1376cb9eaa7ebbbe21c9753d85; a55df99552d6093b6150fe2ca79d017644b73935; 8f968be5da92f08d77ab4cd96ac1b7cd0f87a8c3; e7e78fb2cf7142fe3b674132b8e00654b681df31; 499114d54fa5845a1d8650ac2aa4cbc9b565df85; 81ba886dbaaf68c1ff6cf48a69306bd3e6545296; 3b0910a314b6eaafb3b7c681b418a6e9f7ece13d; 8935522a06065d38f204caaa4e4de42ebab62b97; 678b190a24957df86c06dc3a7f76fe1d021eee80; fda354aebde6565df1b44d2c2bfe6648aa60acad; 73532d91873e4846577a2a962871b38328e59739; b6929312a27c4825dba3a591f32dced6c5d9b1f3; 3a01db8759cda38105f23ca1cf155944d07e8031; 29c7b2ff6c728034fc444df24da39ffebf35ea9e; 0bb30393594fef92f3fef5096faa21b702c7bd2b; 0d6282c650f07b81abb450cdb77722c50c79e40a; da51f11951aa01642307e8abba782d994402f657; 0e8d2e3f9b64acc15f5a3496584f85ef2ee64224; a44d777e0c469b42e26438af931d782b71dba656; 0b731118141cb18c670a244ad713e50876e2078e,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,12,
6f45f11aaa3e5ccbfcd21d13436c1ad1dc07edfa,Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid from COPD Patients Reveals More Compounds Associated with Disease than Matched Plasma,"Smoking causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Though recent studies identified a COPD metabolomic signature in blood, no large studies examine the metabolome in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, a more direct representation of lung cell metabolism. We performed untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on BAL and matched plasma from 115 subjects from the SPIROMICS cohort. Regression was performed with COPD phenotypes as the outcome and metabolites as the predictor, adjusted for clinical covariates and false discovery rate. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) grouped metabolites into modules which were then associated with phenotypes. K-means clustering grouped similar subjects. We detected 7939 and 10,561 compounds in BAL and paired plasma samples, respectively. FEV1/FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second/Forced Vital Capacity) ratio, emphysema, FEV1 % predicted, and COPD exacerbations associated with 1230, 792, eight, and one BAL compounds, respectively. Only two plasma compounds associated with a COPD phenotype (emphysema). Three BAL co-expression modules associated with FEV1/FVC and emphysema. K-means BAL metabolomic signature clustering identified two groups, one with more airway obstruction (34% of subjects, median FEV1/FVC 0.67), one with less (66% of subjects, median FEV1/FVC 0.77; p < 2 Ã— 10-4).

2c4cae3e7a200b6bc2968ad29f33989e65cd19b8,Re-assessment of multiple testing strategies for more efficient genome-wide association studies,"Although enormous costs have been dedicated to discovering relevant disease-related genetic variants, especially in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), only a small fraction of estimated heritability can be explained by these results. This is the so-called missing heritability problem. The conventional use of overly conservative multiple testing strategies based on controlling the familywise error rate (FWER), in particular with a genome-wide significance threshold of Pâ€‰<5â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’8, is one of the most important issues from a statistical perspective. To help resolve this problem, we performed comprehensive re-assessments of currently available strategies using recently published, extremely large-scale GWAS data sets of rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia (>50,000 subjects). The estimates of statistical power averaged for all disease-related genetic variants of the standard FWER-based strategy were only 0.09% for the rheumatoid arthritis data and 0.04% for the schizophrenia data. To design more efficient strategies, we also conducted an extensive comparison of multiple testing strategies by applying false discovery rate (FDR)-controlling procedures to these data sets and simulations, and found that the FDR-based procedures achieved higher power than the FWER-based strategy, even at a strict FDR level (e.g., FDRâ€‰=â€‰1%). We also discuss a useful alternative measure, namely â€œpartial power,â€ which is an averaged power for detecting the clinically and biologically meaningful genetic factors with the largest effects. Simulation results suggest that the FDR-based procedures can achieve sufficient partial power (>80%) for detecting these factors (odds ratios of >1.05) with 80,000 subjects, and thus this may be a useful measure for defining realistic objectives of future GWASs.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Takahiro Otani"", ids = ""49806462""); list(name = ""Hisashi Noma"", ids = ""144974869""); list(name = ""Jo Nishino"", ids = ""1699863""); list(name = ""Shigeyuki Matsui"", ids = ""1687379"")",eb52beb780f03a67d1a7adafb0ce452919ff607d,3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; ab167d29c65598fa414b896efe2914e186ca8d1d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 1a55c95bf74271d88cd50fec1bf5b1c01022f563; 2f5f39cb4136424a5770a083275913a4a0e7c272; c22c7653a853632b1f1250ca23fdf13c49006494; 3d6751b1be76dbdd0a3e65eb45e973bb8d2c4376; ff774f0591a77002ecdec6106161b01099a9bcdc; 3e9506ae61cd06b3412b0b3dcb0f49ec07dd05e2; 19a6d2943e31743ff788ef1663f0839b2d55d614; 36db6663f3a7793e9cc131bade2e372e38fb7cab; 840c0cdb1f428d300cd7986d170da5f807b3d20d; 73057b061a0f9a8442966e9f2a113e4743595021; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; fa9b1dea9b0e78b0ef618ab87c592079fbd4d4ca; 000551662c3902ed66709be879053d95dafc0211; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 78ddc90224240b9a12cdf4ce48cea774d4c7174d; 48bcce3831a5f0c78973990f0aa2ca650b904b7c; 3c423f11a016b4fd8e170c08cf7dbef20eadb2d7; 4ac24482fee0652d3d83ca8a30477004a3d180df; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; c59dbf70c91bc138364f8ed84ba9e87eb39d439a; e8794b45aea8712a86fcd4c2ce636ca3e8cffd5b; 2eced4351be4bf8fa4177d5196bba4c8f0fa916a; 0f5ed44a19d4d06649aa955964c7bbff5bc04331; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dbc447956c16e27cfb030e40552359d3c79bc690; f1527d6030c4544aea14c87023fe2deb351327cc; 53a7a77005e93fb884ebad4fb958bc774b97bf9f; 421d5450ddd044cb53171eb69b3877a9896290ee; 42d121ccca68f05c781835ab73244d016ffa1b71; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; c4ece9a398fc307dbdccde8d652cb61c8e78415c,European Journal of Human Genetics,26,1038-1048
aaa6ac1ae7e7eefb48d2a7b49536b71cbe6a7dff,Imaging correlates of pathology in corticobasal syndrome(Podcast),"Background:Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) can be associated with different underlying pathologies that are difficult to predict based on clinical presentation. The aim of this study was to determine whether patterns of atrophy on imaging could be useful to help predict underlying pathology in CBS. Methods:This was a case-control study of 24 patients with CBS who had undergone MRI during life and came to autopsy. Pathologic diagnoses included frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 immunoreactivity in 5 (CBS-TDP), Alzheimer disease (AD) in 6 (CBS-AD), corticobasal degeneration in 7 (CBS-CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy in 6 (CBS-PSP). Voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation were used to assess atrophy across the CBS groups and compared to 24 age- and gender-matched controls. Results:All CBS pathologic groups showed gray matter loss in premotor cortices, supplemental motor area, and insula on imaging. However, CBS-TDP and CBS-AD showed more widespread patterns of loss, with frontotemporal loss observed in CBS-TDP and temporoparietal loss observed in CBS-AD. CBS-TDP showed significantly greater loss in prefrontal cortex than the other groups, whereas CBS-AD showed significantly greater loss in parietal lobe than the other groups. The focus of loss was similar in CBS-CBD and CBS-PSP, although more severe in CBS-CBD. Conclusions:Imaging patterns of atrophy in CBS vary according to pathologic diagnosis. Widespread atrophy points toward a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD-TDP or AD, with frontotemporal loss suggesting FTLD-TDP and temporoparietal loss suggesting AD. On the contrary, more focal atrophy predominantly involving the premotor and supplemental motor area suggests CBD or PSP pathology.

Mechanisms underlying the physiological reverberations of anxiety, however, are still elusive. Hence, we aimed to investigate molecular processes mediating effects of anxiety on physical health using blood gene expression profiles of 336 community participants (157 anxious and 179 control). We examined genome-wide differential gene expression in anxiety, as well as associations between nine major modules of co-regulated transcripts in blood gene expression and anxiety. No significant differential expression was observed in women, but 631 genes were differentially expressed between anxious and control men at the false discovery rate of 0.1 after controlling for age, body mass index, race, and batch effect. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that genes with altered expression levels in anxious men were involved in response of various immune cells to vaccination and to acute viral and bacterial infection, and in a metabolic network affecting traits of metabolic syndrome. Further, we found one set of 260 co-regulated genes to be significantly associated with anxiety in men after controlling for the relevant covariates, and demonstrate its equivalence to a component of the stress-related conserved transcriptional response to adversity profile. Taken together, our results suggest potential molecular pathways that can explain negative effects of GAD observed in epidemiological studies. Remarkably, even mild anxiety, which most of our participants had, was associated with observable changes in immune-related gene expression levels. Our findings generate hypotheses and provide incremental insights into molecular mechanisms mediating negative physiological effects of GAD.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Aliza P.

Kosorok) High-throughput screening has become an important mainstay for contemporary biomedical research. A standard approach is to use a large number of t-tests simultaneously and then select p-values in a manner that controls false discovery rate (FDR). Existing methods require very strong assumptions on the distribution of the data and the distribution of the p-values. We propose an asymptotically valid, data-driven procedure to find critical values for the t-statistics which requires minimal assumptions. A new asymptotically consistent estimate for the proportion of alternatives has been developed along the way. We demonstrate that our approach has improved computational efficiency and power over existing approaches while requiring fewer assumptions. The method controls the k-family wise error rate (k-FWER), the tail probability of false discovery proportion (FDTP) and false discovery rate (FDR). Simulation studies support our theoretical results and demonstrate the favorable performance of our new multiple testing procedure. We also apply our method to analyze cancer microarray studies. One feature of our approach is that it takes the alternative into account. Existing approaches take the alternative into account as well. However, we found that a standard concavity assumption on the p-value distribution for the alternative is violated under certain circumstances. A more general concept is the monotone likelihood ratio condition (MLRC) introduced in Sun and Cai (2007). We show that the concavity assumption can be violated for (i) a simple heteroscedastic normal mixture model and (ii) dependent tests. Some interesting implications, including the choice of test statistics, existing FDR control procedures (step-up and step-down) and the power definition, are discussed.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Hongyuan Cao"", ids = ""50732710"")",,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 15ab26345d3c7accfa36c04d448e641628bfabbf; 3a5f251451e7cd23f2c560d356f01720e040fe06; 5800894aa631837c684614c2e108da79f73af2a2; 71616c2b98b8d20f9e2261015c5e7874d930bf86; d51139172202e5a5e0000415571deaf2b1ac0b72; 5f843147a0020c49aedfd859e8950e422b764964; b877cf63a1174fbafc1a91aa009f6e9b9c661849; 7302febdec049235971895db54aef77e7624dc3e; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 0cd6a57304e89656611273d9d58d918b52e9c81e; 412aed7ca66a2d2ce51e4f8d5008e60c89eeeb7c; 10ab0830336e3b204202f47aa0fb63a813e3dc71; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 30ca222061654e1ba42024336214f0b7afcb7b98; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 75b0d953ebcd84c493c71f89e6903c42571c15d1; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 9c277ec5dfa4cfb137b627b81a61651d8948173c; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 07f77b7b6dd42ef6019d95e2fcfe7746d9094805; 08d23fdaeec2a46da5189cf105de238fb37bb77e; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; fafff87beeb00b66941f20390d7c6e8eb79c8eaf; 918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785; 6470ca07d9fe23f4f364a6584da954417644fb94; fa3611acf748674c9e74727cf2fbf45b55648d1f; 5e147ca57ea8ba09c571abc2fb75a02724c1b611; 8d4a82f8262abfb55754990665146f8bca94d8d6; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093; b16cd25aef1d6663167733a2ac7681a8d7b23990,,,
ef64d0fb0e715313e6baae3ae167df167b093d3d,Directed shotgun proteomics guided by saturated RNA-seq identifies a complete expressed prokaryotic proteome.,"Prokaryotes, due to their moderate complexity, are particularly amenable to the comprehensive identification of the protein repertoire expressed under different conditions. We applied a generic strategy to identify a complete expressed prokaryotic proteome, which is based on the analysis of RNA and proteins extracted from matched samples. Saturated transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq provided an endpoint estimate of the protein-coding genes expressed under two conditions which mimic the interaction of Bartonella henselae with its mammalian host. Directed shotgun proteomics experiments were carried out on four subcellular fractions. By specifically targeting proteins which are short, basic, low abundant, and membrane localized, we could eliminate their initial underrepresentation compared to the estimated endpoint. A total of 1250 proteins were identified with an estimated false discovery rate below 1%. This represents 85% of all distinct annotated proteins and âˆ¼90% of the expressed protein-coding genes. Genes that were detected at the transcript but not protein level, were found to be highly enriched in several genomic islands. Furthermore, genes that lacked an ortholog and a functional annotation were not detected at the protein level; these may represent examples of overprediction in genome annotations. A dramatic membrane proteome reorganization was observed, including differential regulation of autotransporters, adhesins, and hemin binding proteins. Particularly noteworthy was the complete membrane proteome coverage, which included expression of all members of the VirB/D4 type IV secretion system, a key virulence factor.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ulrich Omasits"", ids = ""2267698""); list(name = ""Maxime QuÃ©batte"", ids = ""4784543""); list(name = ""Daniel J.

b7fbef75331810c5c45b5ee1642044427f3d07cd,A hierarchical testing approach for detecting safety signals in clinical trials.,"Detecting safety signals in clinical trial safety data is known to be challenging due to high dimensionality, rare occurrence, weak signal, and complex dependence. We propose a new hierarchical testing approach for analyzing safety data from a typical randomized clinical trial. This approach accounts for the hierarchical structure of adverse events (AEs), that is, AEs are categorized by system organ class (SOC). Our approach contains two steps: the first step tests, for each SOC, whether any AEs within this SOC are differently distributed between treatment arms; and the second step identifies signal AEs from SOCs passing the first step tests. We show the superiority, in terms of power of detecting safety signals given controlled false discovery rate, of the new approach comparing with currently available approaches through simulation studies. We also demonstrate this approach with two real data examples.",2020,Medicine; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Xianming M Tan"", ids = ""46880176""); list(name = ""Bingshu E Chen"", ids = ""104284089""); list(name = ""Jianping Sun"", ids = ""48480513""); list(name = ""Tejendra B.

7e6ff99d51478c8e0fcddf22c0eb979030dce61c,"Analysis of global and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination gene expression in the progressive stages of human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by a series of pathological changes that range from simple fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The objective of this study is to describe changes in global gene expression associated with the progression of human NAFLD. This study is focused on the expression levels of genes responsible for the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of drugs. Differential gene expression between three clinically defined pathological groups-normal, steatosis, and NASH-was analyzed. Genome-wide mRNA levels in samples of human liver tissue were assayed with Affymetrix GeneChip Human 1.0ST arrays. A total of 11,633 genes exhibited altered expression out of 33,252 genes at a 5% false discovery rate. Most gene expression changes occurred in the progression from steatosis to NASH. Principal component analysis revealed that hepatic disease status was the major determinant of differential ADME gene expression rather than age or sex of sample donors. Among the 515 drug transporters and 258 drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) examined, uptake transporters but not efflux transporters or DMEs were significantly over-represented in the number of genes down-regulated. These results suggest that uptake transporter genes are coordinately targeted for down-regulation at the global level during the pathological development of NASH and that these patients may have decreased drug uptake capacity.

This review provides a selective survey of some recent developments in hypothesis testing for high-dimensional covariance structures, including global testing for the overall pattern of the covariance structures and simultaneous testing of a large collection of hypotheses on the local covariance structures with false discovery proportion and false discovery rate control. Both one-sample and two-sample settings are considered.

0ccbd4dcad2a137c62e47b7c5be1e3adecd6b661,Quantitative Profiling Identifies Potential Regulatory Proteins Involved in Development from Dauer Stage to L4 Stage in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"When Caenorhabditis elegans encounters unfavorable growth conditions, it enters the dauer stage, an alternative L3 developmental period. A dauer larva resumes larval development to the normal L4 stage by uncharacterized postdauer reprogramming (PDR) when growth conditions become more favorable. During this transition period, certain heterochronic genes involved in controlling the proper sequence of developmental events are known to act, with their mutations suppressing the Muv (multivulva) phenotype in C. elegans. To identify the specific proteins in which the Muv phenotype is highly suppressed, quantitative proteomic analysis with iTRAQ labeling of samples obtained from worms at L1 + 30 h (for continuous development [CD]) and dauer recovery +3 h (for postdauer development [PD]) was carried out to detect changes in protein abundance in the CD and PD states of both N2 and lin-28(n719). Of the 1661 unique proteins identified with a < 1% false discovery rate at the peptide level, we selected 58 proteins exhibiting â‰¥2-fold up-regulation or â‰¥2-fold down-regulation in the PD state and analyzed the Gene Ontology terms. RNAi assays against 15 selected up-regulated genes showed that seven genes were predicted to be involved in higher Muv phenotype (p < 0.05) in lin-28(n791), which is not seen in N2. Specifically, two genes, K08H10.1 and W05H9.1, displayed not only the highest rate (%) of Muv phenotype in the RNAi assay but also the dauer-specific mRNA expression, indicating that these genes may be required for PDR, leading to the very early onset of dauer recovery. Thus, our proteomic approach identifies and quantitates the regulatory proteins potentially involved in PDR in C. elegans, which safeguards the overall lifecycle in response to environmental changes.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunhee Kim"", ids = ""48388707""); list(name = ""Hyoung-Joo Lee"", ids = ""40602760""); list(name = ""Jeong-Hoon Hahm"", ids = ""20618283""); list(name = ""Seul-Ki Jeong"", ids = ""3141272""); list(name = ""Don-Ha Park"", ids = ""15178904""); list(name = ""William Hancock"", ids = ""2878867""); list(name = ""Young-Ki Paik"", ids = ""48239400"")",cf58186925bcd127f7fa83b1dc702a8cd38bc696; 9792f6a462d8e28bb3fb719343301dcde0247511; d1c6498779adbe39a1972cf554bf5cec6190c38d,,Journal of proteome research,15 2,"

3854b94f624704d333527dfe5fd5b0fa82fc9f54,"Investigations into refinements of Storey's method of multiple hypothesis testing minimising the FDR, and its application to test binomial data","Storey's method for multiple hypothesis testing ''the Optimal Discovery Procedure'' (ODP) minimising the false discovery rate (FDR) and giving p-values and q-values (estimates of FDR) for each test, was extended by iteration to enforce consistency between the p-values of the tests and the binary parameters defining which data points contribute to the fitted null hypothesis. These parameters arise when the null hypothesis has to be estimated from the data. The ODP as previously described, is only optimal for fixed values of these parameters. The extension proposed here requires the introduction of a cut-off parameter for the p-values. Motivated by using this method to analyse a set of pairs of frequencies representing gene expression for a set of genes in two libraries, from which it was desired to select those that are most likely to be not following the null hypothesis that the frequency ratio is a fixed unknown number, this method was tested by analysing many similar simulated datasets. The results showed that the ODP modified by iteration could be improved sometimes greatly by a suitable choice of the cut-off parameter, but varying this parameter alone may not lead to the globally optimal solution because statistical testing based on the binomial distribution is more efficient than using a form of the ODP when the number of non-null hypotheses in the data is small, but the reverse is true when it is large. This may be an effect of using discrete data. Efficiency here is defined in terms of the expected proportion of errors that occur (q-value) when a given proportion of the data is declared ''significant'' (i.e. the null hypothesis is believed not to hold for them). An improved version of the ODP along these lines is likely to have numerous applications such as in the optimised search for candidate genes that show unusual expression patterns for example when more than two experimental conditions are simultaneously compared and to cases when additional categorical variables or a time series is present in the experimental design.",2012,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""John H.

62b8b0c6c93294b9f1fcc333988d327729e0dd97,Abstract P6-16-03: Intrinsic subtypes and MRI patterns in brain metastasis associated with breast cancer,"Background: Breast cancer is the 2nd most common cancer to metastasize to the brain. The development of brain metastasis (BM) is associated with a lower median survival compared with other locations of metastasis and carries with it high morbidity and reduced quality of life. There are limited treatment options and virtually no approved targeted therapies for this disease. We have previously reported specific pathways enriched in BM compared to primary tumors and now further this study to examine pathways by intrinsic subtype and location of and number of BM. Methods: Archival FFPE material was obtained from BM using pathology records; clinical data, including MRI images, was retrieved from medical records and institutional tumor registry under an IRB protocol. Tumor DNA/RNA was extracted from 2 mm cores macrodissected from the FFPE tissue blocks using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit. Gene expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 microarray on BM samples for which sufficient RNA was available. Gene-level expression quantification was derived after RMA normalization using the Affymetrix Transcriptome Analysis Console. PAM50 subtypes were assigned by clustering samples using median-subtracted PAM50 gene expression levels. Differential gene expression was estimated using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, followed by assessment of false discovery rate using the Banjamini-Hochberg FDR methodology. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the NCI Pathway Interaction Database. Results: Gene expression profiling showed the following intrinsic subtype distribution among all BM: luminal A 32% (19/59), luminal B 31% (18/59), HER2 enriched 7% (4/59), and basal subtype 31% (18/59). At time of development of BM 64% (38/59) of patients presented with a single lesion compared to 36% (21/59) of patients who presented with multiple lesions (p=0.12). Thirty-nine percent (7/18) of patients with basal subtypes were observed to present with multiple BM compared to 61% (11/18) non-basal subtypes (p=0.25). In addition, 12% (13/59) of BM were found to be exclusively dural-based lesions. They appeared more frequently in the luminal subtypes [11/13 vs 2/13; p=0.06]. A total of 314 genes were differentially expressed (Wilcox pval Conclusion: Identifying pathways that are differentially expressed between intrinsic subtypes may help us develop new targeted therapies to provide more treatment options for breast cancer patients with brain metastasis.

2f76cbf5ab679ffa5cbce13230438947afaba12c,Peripheral blood gene expression profile associated with sustained virologic response after peginterferon plus ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis-C genotype 1.,"We investigated the relationship between global gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during the first 4 weeks of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy and long-term eradication of hepatitis-C genotype 1 infections in 23 patients. A sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as an undetected serum HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) at week 72, was the virologic response endpoint. PBMC RNA was prepared at week 0 and week 4 from 23 patients (17 black and 6 white Americans), and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays. Compared to week 0, 269 genes were differentially expressed at week 4 of treatment, including many genes regulated by alpha interferons and associated with host immunity (p<0.0001), cell signal transduction (p<0.001) and cellular protein metabolism (p<0.001). Expression of these 269 genes at week 0 and week 4 did not differ significantly between patients with and without a SVR. In contrast, SVR was associated with differential expression of 98 genes at week 4 (false discovery rate <0.01). Many of the genes have been implicated in control of HCV lifecycle and thus may play important roles in HCV clearance during peginterferon and ribavirin therapy.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chao Qun Huang"", ids = ""36381834""); list(name = ""Hegang Chen"", ids = ""31754151""); list(name = ""William M.

760e3242bdd7aaf880c89c6dc7198709fb903576,A Prospective Multi-National Study of the Colorectal Cancer Mucosal Microbiome Reveals Specific Taxonomic Changes Indicative of Disease Stage and Prognosis,"Introduction The colorectal cancer (CRC) microbiome is niche specific and individualised. Several putative driver organisms enriched on CRCs have been identified from human studies, but few data exist which properly account for important clinical variables in CRC. In this study, we used a meta-taxonomic approach to demonstrate how the CRC microbiome varies with disease stage, histological markers of prognosis and host molecular phenotypes. Method A prospective study was performed on patients undergoing colonoscopy and elective surgery for CRC at three hospitals in UK and Czech Republic. Tissue was sampled from tumours, adenomas, adjacent normal mucosa and mucosa from healthy colon controls. The V1-2 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced (Illumina MiSeq); data were processed in Mothur and analysed in Stamp and R. Species assignment was performed with NCBI BLAST for microbial genomes. False discovery rate p value correction accounted for multiple testing. Histological analysis and tumour molecular phenotyping were performed according to Royal College of Pathology guidelines. Results One hundred and ninety six patients were recruited: 158 CRC patients, 24 adenoma patients and 14 normal colon controls (median age 70; range 35â€“90). Tumours were staged as 6â€‰T0, 4â€‰T1, 23â€‰T2, 97â€‰T3, 27â€‰T4; 99â€‰N0, 40â€‰N1, 27â€‰N2; 6â€‰M1. No significant differences were seen in diversity or taxonomy between the UK and Czech cohorts. Adenoma and healthy colon control samples were taxonomically indistinct. However, CRCs were characterised by reduced Shannon diversity (p Conclusion This large prospective analysis demonstrates that the CRC microbiome is stage-specific and appears to evolve with disease progression. We conclude that oral pathobionts which colonise advanced stage disease relate to markers of tumour prognosis, raising the possibility that they may be directly influencing tumour invasion.

The molecular factors underlying the development of inflammation and severe fibrosis in NASH remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression patterns related to obesity-related NASH inflammation and fibrosis. We performed sequencing-based mRNA profiling analysis of liver samples from individuals with normal histology (n = 24), lobular inflammation (n = 53), or bridging fibrosis, incomplete cirrhosis, or cirrhosis (n = 65). Hepatic expression of a subset of mRNAs was validated using an orthogonal method, analyzed in a hepatic stellate cell line, and used to identify transcriptional patterns shared by other forms of cirrhosis. We observed evidence for differential levels of 3820 and 2980 transcripts in lobular inflammation and advanced fibrosis, respectively, compared with normal histology (false discovery rate â‰¤0.05), including 176 genes specific to fibrosis. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes revealed participation in pathways involving cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. We identified 34 differentially expressed transcripts in comparisons of lobular inflammation and fibrosis, a proportion of which were also upregulated during activation of hepatic stellate cells. A set of 16 genes from a previous independent study of NASH bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis were replicated, several of which have also been associated with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis due to hepatitis viruses or alcohol in human patients. Dysregulated mRNA expression is associated with inflammation and fibrosis in NASH.

693116c74b8d0ad0dac1f1e5268013a0db08a7ad,Progesterone and plasma metabolites in women with and in those without premenstrual dysphoric disorder,"BACKGROUND
The molecular mechanisms underpinning the progesterone-triggering mood symptoms in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are unknown. Cell metabolism is a potential source of variability. Very little is known about the effect of progesterone sensitivity on the metabolome. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effects of progesterone on the global metabolic profile and explore the differences between women with PMDD and controls.


METHODS
Plasma was obtained from 12 women with prospectively confirmed PMDD and 25 controls under two hormone conditions: (1) gonadal suppression induced by leuprolide acetate (3.75Â mg IM monthly) and (2) add-back phase with leuprolide and progesterone (200Â mg twice daily by vaginal suppository). The global metabolic profile was obtained using liquid and gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Differences between groups and time points were tested using repeated measures analysis of variance. The false discovery rate was calculated to account for multiple testing.


RESULTS
Amino acids and their derivatives represented 78% (28/36) of the known compounds that were found in significantly lower plasma concentrations after progesterone administration than during gonadal suppression. The concentration of tyrosine was nominally significantly decreased after progesterone add-back in controls, but not in cases (PÂ =Â 0.02).


CONCLUSION
Plasma levels of some amino acids are decreased in response to progesterone. Albeit preliminary, evidence further suggests that progesterone has a different effect on the metabolic profiles of women with PMDD compared to controls. Further research is needed to replicate our findings in a larger sample and to identify the unknown compounds, especially those differentially expressed.",2018,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arianna Di Florio"", ids = ""112958423""); list(name = ""Danny C.

Differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites may link BPA exposure to health impacts. We examined the association of prenatal BPA exposure with genome-wide DNA methylation changes in cord blood in 277 mother-child pairs in the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Childrenâ€™s Health, using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. We observed that a large portion of BPA-associated differentially methylated CpGs with p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.0001 was hypomethylated among all newborns (91%) and female infants (98%), as opposed to being hypermethylated (88%) among males. We found 27 and 16 CpGs with a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05 in the analyses for males and females, respectively. Genes annotated to FDR-corrected CpGs clustered into an interconnected genetic network among males, while they rarely exhibited any interactions in females. In contrast, none of the enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms with FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05 was observed for genes annotated to the male-specific CpGs with pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001, whereas the female-specific genes were significantly enriched for GO terms related to cell adhesion. Our epigenome-wide analysis of cord blood DNA methylation implies potential sex-specific epigenome responses to BPA exposure.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ryu Miura"", ids = ""50119750""); list(name = ""Atsuko Araki"", ids = ""2080199"");

d465f91539f896bf07d3b6cb012cc19926574d53,Dissecting the roles of microRNAs in coronary heart disease via integrative genomic analyses.,"OBJECTIVE
The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in coronary heart disease (CHD) have not been well characterized. This study sought to systematically characterize the complex genomic architecture of CHD by integrating whole blood miRNA and mRNA expression with genetic variation in 186 CHD cases and 186 controls.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
At false discovery rate <0.2, 15 miRNAs were differentially expressed between CHD cases and controls. To explore regulatory mechanisms, we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression with genome-wide genotype data to investigate miRNA and mRNA associations and relationships of genetic variation with miRNAs. We identified a large number of correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs and genetic loci that seem to regulate miRNA levels. Subsequently, we explored the relationships of these complex molecular associations with CHD status. We identified a large difference in miRNA-mRNA associations between CHD cases and controls, as demonstrated by a significantly higher proportion of inversely correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs in cases versus controls (80% versus 30%; P<1Ã—10(-16)), suggesting a genome-wide shift in the regulatory structure of the transcriptome in CHD. The differentially coexpressed miRNA-mRNA pairs showed enrichment for CHD risk genetic variants affecting both miRNA and mRNA expression levels, implicating a putatively causal role in CHD. Furthermore, 3 miRNAs (miR-1275, miR-365a-3p, and miR-150-5p) were associated with an mRNA coexpression module that was causally linked to CHD and reflected the dysregulation of B-cell centered immune function.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results provide novel evidence that miRNAs are important regulators of biological processes involved in CHD via genetic control and via their tight coexpression with mRNAs.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tianxiao Huan"", ids = ""2789524""); list(name = ""Jian Rong"", ids = ""145119158""); list(name = ""Kahraman Tanriverdi"", ids = ""3536537""); list(name = ""Qingying Meng"", ids = ""6683890""); list(name = ""Anindya Bhattacharya"", ids = ""152939359""); list(name = ""David D.

28370c28fd706be8ff9d8be36722f3a6661fdf80,Multi-weighting for FDR control,"In the context of multiple hypothesis testing, we propose a new method of $p$-value weighting when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). To deal with all the possible rejection numbers in the FDR, we consider a matrix of weights and we integrate it in a new class of procedures, called the ``multi-weighted'' procedures. First, we propose multi-weighted step-up and step-down procedures which control rigourously the FDR under independence, positive dependence (PRDS) and general dependence. Second, we propose a way to derive a weight matrix which is optimal in the sense of power. When the optimal weight matrix is reasonably well approached, we demonstrate in a simulation study that the corresponding multi-weighted procedures outperform the standard uniformly-weighted Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Finally, we apply our method to the two sample multiple comparison problem, and we demonstrate its interest in practice with an application to microarray experiments.",2008,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Etienne Roquain"", ids = ""3117456""); list(name = ""Mark A. van de Wiel"", ids = ""2354241"")",0e6ec928838044a337b9b5070b0e557fe12c4b11; 087f9482b1ad71e449c7ad758a3b235626168cc5; 4225126bdc2a75577fa6f9ea67d0b4617773c44b; 6984b7e591e64325c9b6b74ce8e0fb7c5bb2746d; be3681e06bb3b0635b9a3775935dd15c0151c823; 6d3fb1482ea20a3d75d39c0147977e775c1af173,,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
0cf09bcf909337134e6840899ee71167758dffce,"Effect of cleavage enzyme, search algorithm and decoy database on mass spectrometric identification of wheat gluten proteins.","While tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is routinely used to identify proteins from complex mixtures, certain types of proteins present unique challenges for MS/MS analyses. The major wheat gluten proteins, gliadins and glutenins, are particularly difficult to distinguish by MS/MS. Each of these groups contains many individual proteins with similar sequences that include repetitive motifs rich in proline and glutamine. These proteins have few cleavable tryptic sites, often resulting in only one or two tryptic peptides that may not provide sufficient information for identification. Additionally, there are less than 14,000 complete protein sequences from wheat in the current NCBInr release. In this paper, MS/MS methods were optimized for the identification of the wheat gluten proteins. Chymotrypsin and thermolysin as well as trypsin were used to digest the proteins and the collision energy was adjusted to improve fragmentation of chymotryptic and thermolytic peptides. Specialized databases were constructed that included protein sequences derived from contigs from several assemblies of wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs), including contigs assembled from ESTs of the cultivar under study. Two different search algorithms were used to interrogate the database and the results were analyzed and displayed using a commercially available software package (Scaffold). We examined the effect of protein database content and size on the false discovery rate. We found that as database size increased above 30,000 sequences there was a decrease in the number of proteins identified. Also, the type of decoy database influenced the number of proteins identified. Using three enzymes, two search algorithms and a specialized database allowed us to greatly increase the number of detected peptides and distinguish proteins within each gluten protein group.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""William H.

fdf107d1e174e3bcfa9e5b00ba3fb507f878ed63,Spatiotemporal Normalization for Longitudinal Analysis of Gray Matter Atrophy in Frontotemporal Dementia,"We present a unified method, based on symmetric diffeomorphisms, for studying longitudinal neurodegeneration. Our method first uses symmetric diffeomorphic normalization to find a spatiotemporal parameterization of an individual's image time series. The second step involves mapping a representative image or set of images from the time series into an optimal template space. The template mapping is then combined with the intrasubject spatiotemporal map to enable pairwise statistical tests to be performed on a population of normalized time series images. Here, we apply this longitudinal analysis protocol to study the gray matter atrophy patterns induced by frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We sample our normalized spatiotemporal maps at baseline (time zero) and time one year to generate an annualized atrophy map (AAM) that estimates the annual effect of FTD. This spatiotemporal normalization enables us to locate neuroanatomical regions that consistently undergo significant annual gray matter atrophy across the population. We found the majority of annual atrophy to occur in the frontal and temporal lobes in our population of 20 subjects. We also found significant effects in the hippocampus, insula and cingulate gyrus. Our novel results, significant at p < 0.05 after false discovery rate correction, are represented in local template space but also assigned Talairach coordinates and Brodmann and Anatomical Automatic Labeling (AAL) labels. This paper shows the statistical power of symmetric diffeomorphic normalization for performing deformation-based studies of longitudinal atrophy.",2007,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brian B.

It consists of many statistical tests and one of several powerful corrections for multiple comparisons. Multiple comparison corrections differ in their power and permissiveness. Moreover, some methods are not guaranteed to work or may be overly sensitive to uninteresting deviations from the null hypothesis. Here we report the results of simulations assessing the accuracy, permissiveness, and power of six popular multiple comparison corrections (permutation-based control of the familywise error rate [FWER], weak control of FWER via cluster-based permutation tests, permutation-based control of the generalized FWER, and three false discovery rate control procedures) using realistic ERP data. In addition, we look at the sensitivity of permutation tests to differences in population variance. These results will help researchers apply and interpret these procedures.",2011,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""David M. Groppe"", ids = ""2779859""); list(name = ""Thomas P.

d6da62614e08b4bceff2456488649f17beef0baf,Large-scale simultaneous hypothesis testing in monitoring carbon content from French soil database â€” A semi-parametric mixture approach,"Abstract Investigating the information of the French National Soil Tests database for soil monitoring produces multiple hypothesis testing problems with hundreds or thousands of test responses to consider simultaneously. A largely used concept of error control in such multiple testing is the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses, or False Discovery Rate (FDR). A related notion of local FDR ( l FDR) can be appropriately represented by considering that the observed p -values come from a two-component mixture model where the component corresponding to the null hypothesis is known. In this work, we explore different solutions for FDR estimation. In particular, we introduce a specific version of a semi-parametric Expectationâ€“Maximization (EM) algorithm for l FDR estimation, and compare it to classical l FDR estimation using parametric mixtures, and conventional FDR approaches. The performances of the different models for estimating the FDR and related criteria are first illustrated on the results of simulated multiple comparison tests. These approaches are then applied to soil carbon content monitoring on our database. The results show that not taking into account the FDR estimation can lead to over-estimation of the number of cantons (locations) subject to a significant change. However, we have detected large numbers of significant changes in the database that occurred during the time period of this study. Globally, losses in organic carbon are observed in Northern France, along the Atlantic coastal regions, and to a lesser extent for the data collected over the North-Eastern regions. The OC increases are more scattered over the territory.

240ebfa54587d31d81b6fe8e5d0feb9d8dc06fc8,DNA mismatch repair network gene polymorphism as a susceptibility factor for pancreatic cancer.,"DNA repair plays a critical role in human cancers. We hypothesized that DNA mismatch repair gene variants are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. We retrospectively genotyped 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 13 mismatch repair related genes in 706 patients with pancreatic cancer and 706 cancer-free controls using the mass spectroscopy-based MassArray method. Association of genotype with pancreatic cancer risk was tested by multivariate logistic regression models. A significance level of P â‰¤ 0.0015 was set at the false discovery rate (FDR) <1% using the Beta-Uniform Mixture method. We found 28 SNPs related to altered pancreatic cancer risk (P < 0.05). Adjusting for multiple comparisons, MGMT I143V AG/GG, PMS2 IVS1-1121C > T TC/TT, and PMS2L3 Ex1â€‰+â€‰118C > T CT/TT genotypes showed significant main effects on pancreatic cancer risk at FDR <1% with OR (95% CI) of 0.60 (0.46-0.80), 1.44 (1.14-1.81), and 5.54 (2.10-14.61), respectively (P â‰¤ 0.0015). To demonstrate genotype-phenotype association, we measured O(6)-ethylguanosine (O(6)-EtGua) adduct levels in vitro by immunoslot blot assay in lymphocytes treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) in 297 case/control subjects. MGMT I143V GG, MGMT K178R GG, MSH6 G39E AG/AA, PMS2L3 IVS3â€‰+â€‰9A > G GA and TP73 IVS1-7449G > C CG/CC genotypes correlated with a higher level of ENU-induced DNA adducts. Haplotypes of MGMT, MSH6, PMS2, PMS2L3, and TP73 were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk (P â‰¤ 0.0015).

95686586f26d5a1d152db72f6283c7a73335a513,Power-enhanced Multiple Decision Functions Controlling Family-wise Error and False Discovery Rates.,"Improved procedures, in terms of smaller missed discovery rates (MDR), for performing multiple hypotheses testing with weak and strong control of the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) are developed and studied. The improvement over existing procedures such as the Å idÃ¡k procedure for FWER control and the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for FDR control is achieved by exploiting possible differences in the powers of the individual tests. Results signal the need to take into account the powers of the individual tests and to have multiple hypotheses decision functions which are not limited to simply using the individual p-values, as is the case, for example, with the Å idÃ¡k, Bonferroni, or BH procedures. They also enhance understanding of the role of the powers of individual tests, or more precisely the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) functions of decision processes, in the search for better multiple hypotheses testing procedures. A decision-theoretic framework is utilized, and through auxiliary randomizers the procedures could be used with discrete or mixed-type data or with rank-based nonparametric tests. This is in contrast to existing p-value based procedures whose theoretical validity is contingent on each of these p-value statistics being stochastically equal to or greater than a standard uniform variable under the null hypothesis. Proposed procedures are relevant in the analysis of high-dimensional ""large M, small n"" data sets arising in the natural, physical, medical, economic and social sciences, whose generation and creation is accelerated by advances in high-throughput technology, notably, but not limited to, microarray technology.",2011,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Edsel A.

Expression of the cry34Ab1 and cry35Ab1 genes confers resistance to corn rootworms, and the pat gene confers tolerance to herbicides containing glufosinate-ammonium. Sixty crossbred steers (396 kg) were individually fed either transgenic corn (DAS-59122-7; 59122), a near-isogenic, nontransgenic control (Control), and a conventional, nontransgenic corn for 109 d to evaluate nutritional equivalency (20 steers/treatment). The corn was coarsely rolled (geometric mean diameter = 4,200 Î¼m) and treatments were offered in the finishing diet at 82% of diet DM. Gain (P = 0.38) and G:F (P = 0.80) were similar between 59122 and Control with a tendency for a difference in DMI (P = 0.08). When adjusted using the statistical analysis of false discovery rate, DMI, ADG, and G:F were not different between Control and 59122 (P > 0.33). No differences were observed between Control and 59122 for HCW, marbling score, LM area, fat depth, or calculated USDA YG (P > 0.12). The genetically modified corn DAS-59122-7 was nutritionally equivalent to a near-isogenic control when fed to finishing steers. Feeding corn grain containing these transgenic traits did not influence steer performance or carcass quality.",2017,,"list(name = ""Taia J. Huls"", ids = ""16592477""); list(name = ""Galen E.

6cd435383c457686d1425adf0412d95169d3d301,"Genomics, prior probability, and statistical tests of multiple hypotheses.","Genomic methods have made statistical multiple-test methods important to geneticists and molecular biologists. These tests apply to identification of quantitative trait loci and measurement of changes in RNA or DNA abundance by microarray methods. Recently developed multiple-test methods provide more statistical power when many of the tested null hypotheses are false. At the same time, these methods can provide stringent control of errors in cases when most or all of the tested null hypotheses are true. These methods control errors in a different way from previous hypothesis tests, controlling or estimating quantities called the posterior error rate (PER), false discovery rate (FDR), or proportion of false positives (PFP), rather than the type I error. In this study, we attempt to clarify the relationships among these methods and demonstrate how the proportion of true null hypotheses among all tested hypotheses plays an important role. Genomic methods, those that evaluate many genes or many genomic locations for some property, often require testing a large set of statistical hypotheses, called a family of hypotheses. Such a family may include thousands of hypotheses. For example, detection of quantitative trait loci involves testing a statistical association between trait values and genotypes at several hundred marker loci (Lander and Botstein 1989). Microarray analysis of RNA expression may involve looking for changes among thousands of RNA species (Lockhart et al. 1996). Combining the two techniques (Jansen and Nap 2001; Brem et al. 2002; Schadt et al. 2003), tests pairwise associations between thousands of RNA expression patterns and genotypes at hundreds of marker loci. Naive application of standard hypothesis tests with no adjustment for multiple testing will yield large numbers of nonreproducible positive results or false discoveries (Soric 1989). On the other hand, using multiple testing methods to control the familywise type I error rate (FWER, see below) can greatly reduce the power to detect discoveries in families of tests where many such cases should be detected. In this study, we examine the relationship between the traditional type I error and the other criteria that seem more useful for genetics hypothesis testing. The issue is essentially that faced by Morton (1955) when he proposed that an LOD score of 3.0 be required to declare linkage of genetic loci in humans. Formal statistical hypothesis tests provide a standard method for interpreting experimental data. They contrast a null hypothesis, H0, and an alternative hypothesis, H1. The null hypothesis H0 is chosen so that the probability of any experimental outcome can be calculated assuming H0 to be true. If under H0 the probability of observing results as extreme or more extreme than the observed results from an experiment is less than some desired value , H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. The value is the desired type I error rate, or the probability of rejecting H0 when H0 is true. This value may also be called the comparisonwise type I error rate (CWER) when it refers to the rate for a single test in a family of tests. Suppose now that there is a family of m tests and that the null hypothesis is true for m0 of the tests and false for m1 = m â€“m0 of them. Table 1 summarizes the possible outcomes for this family of m tests. Each test yields a value x for a statistic X and a p-value, which is P(X x|H0), the probability that X would match or exceed the observed value x under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. For m0 of the tests, those for which the null hypothesis is true, the pvalues are uniformly distributed. For the other m1 tests, the distribution of p-values will be stochastically smaller than a uniform distribution (i.e., P(p x|H1) x = P(p x|H0) for any x between 0 and 1). The ratios 0 = m0/m and 1 = m1/m, when m is large, can be interpreted as approximate Bayesian prior probabilities of the null and alternative hypotheses, respectively. The terms â€œdiscoveryâ€ (Soric 1989) or â€œpositive resultâ€ are often used to refer to a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is rejected. The terms â€œfalse discoveryâ€ or â€œfalse positiveâ€ are commonly used to describe the case in which the null hypothesis is rejected, although it is, in fact, true. The power of a test is the probability that a positive result will be obtained when the null hypothesis is false. Tests with high power will tend to produce high values of S in Table 1, whereas tests with low power may produce high values of T in Table 1. The familywise error rate (FWER), also known as the overall type I error rate, is the probability of one or more type I errors in a family of tests. In terms of the definitions in Table 1, the FWER is simply P(V > 0). Much of the past research in the area of multiple testing has focused on the development of methods that control this probability. Strong control of the FWER at level is achieved if the FWER is less than or equal to , regardless of the number of false null hypotheses (m1). Weak control is obtained if the FWER is less than or equal to whenever all tested null hypotheses are true (m0 = m) and not necessarily less than or equal to when some of the null hypotheses are false (m1 > 0). Controlling the FWER is important for tests in which the family is being tested as a unit, and the rejection of any null hypothesis affects the whole family. More generally, control of the FWER is important whenever it is necessary for an analysis to produce no false positives with high probability. When a family contains many tests, producing no false positives with high probability may require a substantial degree of conservativeness that could lead to many type II errors (i.e., large values of T in Table 1). Suppose, for example, that a method used to test each of the m genes for differential expression in a microarray experiment correctly rejects 99 false null hypotheses and incorrectly rejects one true null hypothesis (S = 99, V = 1, R = 100). From the standpoint of FWER error control, the performance of the method on this one data set would be considered in error because of the one false positive result. Such an error would be allowed to occur in only 5% of the experiments to which the method would be Corresponding author. E-MAIL Kmanly@Tennessee.edu; FAX (901) 4487193.

twilight is a Bioconductor compatible package for analysing the statistical significance of differentially expressed genes. It is based on the concept of the local false discovery rate (FDR), a generalization of the frequently used global FDR. twilight implements the heuristic search algorithm for estimating the local FDR introduced in our earlier work. In addition to the raw significance measures, it produces diagnostic plots, which provide insight into the extent of differential expression across genes.

8a9857f3982d8d61458b2aeec823a23bcbc3bd02,Genome-wide association for heifer reproduction and calf performance traits in beef cattle.,"The aim of this study was to identify SNP markers that associate with variation in beef heifer reproduction and performance of their calves. A genome-wide association study was performed by means of the generalized quasi-likelihood score (GQLS) method using heifer genotypes from the BovineSNP50 BeadChip and estimated breeding values for pre-breeding body weight (PBW), pregnancy rate (PR), calving difficulty (CD), age at first calving (AFC), calf birth weight (BWT), calf weaning weight (WWT), and calf pre-weaning average daily gain (ADG). Data consisted of 785 replacement heifers from three Canadian research herds, namely Brandon Research Centre, Brandon, Manitoba, University of Alberta Roy Berg Kinsella Ranch, Kinsella, Alberta, and Lacombe Research Centre, Lacombe, Alberta. After applying a false discovery rate correction at a 5% significance level, a total of 4, 3, 3, 9, 6, 2, and 1 SNPs were significantly associated with PBW, PR, CD, AFC, BWT, WWT, and ADG, respectively. These SNPs were located on chromosomes 1, 5-7, 9, 13-16, 19-21, 24, 25, and 27-29. Chromosomes 1, 5, and 24 had SNPs with pleiotropic effects. New significant SNPs that impact functional traits were detected, many of which have not been previously reported. The results of this study support quantitative genetic studies related to the inheritance of these traits, and provides new knowledge regarding beef cattle quantitative trait loci effects. The identification of these SNPs provides a starting point to identify genes affecting heifer reproduction traits and performance of their calves (BWT, WWT, and ADG).

330e387631b4c3742c9cb44ee0cf95cc8fe74a75,Myotubularin-related proteins 3 and 4 interact with polo-like kinase 1 and centrosomal protein of 55 kDa to ensure proper abscission.,"The myotubularins are a family of phosphatases that dephosphorylate the phosphatidylinositols phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-phosphate. Several family members are mutated in disease, yet the biological functions of the majority of myotubularins remain unknown. To gain insight into the roles of the individual enzymes, we have used affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to identify protein-protein interactions for the myotubularins. The myotubularin interactome comprises 66 high confidence (false discovery rate â‰¤1%) interactions, including 18 pairwise interactions between individual myotubularins. The results reveal a number of potential signaling contexts for this family of enzymes, including an intriguing, novel role for myotubularin-related protein 3 and myotubularin-related protein 4 in the regulation of abscission, the final step of mitosis in which the membrane bridge remaining between two daughter cells is cleaved. Both depletion and overexpression of either myotubularin-related protein 3 or myotubularin-related protein 4 result in abnormal midbody morphology and cytokinesis failure. Interestingly, myotubularin-related protein 3 and myotubularin-related protein 4 do not exert their effects through lipid regulation at the midbody, but regulate abscission during early mitosis, by interacting with the mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1, and with centrosomal protein of 55 kDa (CEP55), an important regulator of abscission. Structure-function analysis reveals that, consistent with known intramyotubularin interactions, myotubularin-related protein 3 and myotubularin-related protein 4 interact through their respective coiled coil domains. The interaction between myotubularin-related protein 3 and polo-like kinase 1 relies on the divergent, nonlipid binding Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1 domain of myotubularin-related protein 3, and myotubularin-related protein 4 interacts with CEP55 through a short GPPXXXY motif, analogous to endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I components. Disruption of any of these interactions results in abscission failure, by disrupting the proper recruitment of CEP55, and subsequently, of endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I, to the midbody. Our data suggest that myotubularin-related protein 3 and myotubularin-related protein 4 may act as a bridge between CEP55 and polo-like kinase 1, ensuring proper CEP55 phosphorylation and regulating CEP55 recruitment to the midbody. This work provides a novel role for myotubularin-related protein 3/4 heterodimers, and highlights the temporal and spatial complexity of the regulation of cytokinesis.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicole St-Denis"", ids = ""1398746704""); list(name = ""Gagan D.

84851dd29915960a4c8023536ed9f6aa5fc0a94d,Serum proteomics and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)-guided discovery of response markers to androgen ablation (AA) in prostate cancer.,"11 Background: Currently there are no serum markers of response to AA. We performed a proteome based analysis of serum from prostate cancer patients, followed by mapping of candidate markers to networks based on known molecular interactions in Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB).


METHODS
Isobaric mass tags for relative and absolute quanititation (iTRAQ) analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was performed in serum of 3 non-localized prostate cancer cohorts. The first cohort included 15 paired untreated hormone-sensitive ""pre AA"" and 3-month ""post AA"" specimens; the second included 10 ""early AA failure"" (median failure time: 11 months) and the third included 10 ""late AA failure"" specimens (median failure time: 95 months). Differentially expressed candidate proteins were identified by comparisons of (i) paired pre/post AA proteomes and (ii) post AA proteome with the combined AA failure cohorts at a False Discovery Rate of 0.2. To facilitate biological interpretation of multiple candidates identified in the comparisons, IPA was used. Candidate markers implicated in IPA networks with statistical significance were pursued in a second, independent patient cohort for association with time to AA failure using univariate Cox regression analysis.


RESULTS
Median PSA for pre/post AA first cohort were 3.15 and 0.29 ng/ml. Median PSA for the second and third cohorts were 27.3 and 4.3 ng/ml. Between post AA and AA failure cohorts, 149 proteins were differentially expressed. Between early and late AA failure 98 proteins were differentially expressed; 47 proteins were common in both comparisons. Network enrichment analysis of the 47 proteins by IPA identified four interaction networks (p<0.01), one of which highlighted a role for 17-Î²-estradiol (E1). Gas chromatography used for measuring 3-month post AA initiation serum E1, estrone (E2) and testosterone levels (N=38) detected high E1, E2 levels associated with longer time to AA failure (P=0.07 for E1; P=0.08 for E2) in the independent cohort.


CONCLUSIONS
A global proteomic analysis identified post AA initiation serum E1, E2 levels as potential response markers, which needs validation.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Ann L.

574db43c2aadf57e6126ef83236ea92b83abd64b,Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies Two Discrete Druggable Signaling Pathways in Follicular Thyroid Cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with continuously increasing incidence. Follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of these cases and is known to be associated with several gene mutations. The purpose of this study was to identify novel therapeutic targets in FTC using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and bioinformatics analysis.


STUDY DESIGN
Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 6 established FTC cell lines. Stringent false-proof filtering and exclusion of synonymous and known polymorphisms yielded novel missense, nonsense, and splice-site single nucleotide variants (SNV). Gene variants were analyzed for structural, functional, and evolutionary properties using GO (Gene Ontology), Pfam (Protein Families), and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) searches by STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) and GORILLA (Gene Ontology enRIchment anaLysis and visuaLizAtion tool) analyses. A false discovery rate of <0.5 was used to denote significantly enriched signaling pathways.


RESULTS
An average of 657 (range 366 to 1,158) SNVs including 31 (range 12 to 53) known cancer driver genes were identified in FTC cell line exomes. The SNV burden, distribution, frequency, and signature followed the known thyroid mutation profiles, without chromosomal bias. Recurrently mutated cancer driver genes included FRG1 (6/6), CDC27, NCOR1, PRSS1 (5/6), AHCTF1, MUC20, PABPC1, and PABPC3 (4/6). Pathway analysis using bioinformatics tools STRING and GORILLA segregated FTC cell lines into 2 druggable signaling groups showing dominant RAS/ERK1-2/AKT and CDK1/CyclinB signaling pathway targets.


CONCLUSIONS
Next-generation sequencing tools can be used to identify druggable signaling targets for precision treatment of FTCs.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Neeta J.

de64968316c10b80963540e74e55ca94f2f88e9b,De novo transcriptome of the mayfly Cloeon viridulum and transcriptional signatures of Prometabola,"Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) display many primitive characters and a unique type of metamorphosis (Prometabola). However, information on the genomes and transcriptomes of this insect group is limited. The RNA sequencing study presented here generated the first de novo transcriptome assembly of Cloeon viridulum (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae), and compared gene expression signatures among the young larva (YL), mature larva (ML), subimago (SI), and imago (IM) stages of this mayfly. The transcriptome, based on 88 Gb of sequence data, comprised a set of 81,185 high quality transcripts. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in YL vs. ML, ML vs. SI, and SI vs. IM, was 4,825, 1,584, and 1,278, respectively, according to the reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads analysis, assuming a false discovery rate <0.05 and a fold change >2. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were enriched in the ""chitin metabolic process"", ""germ cell development"", ""steroid hormone biosynthesis"", and ""cutin, suberine, and wax biosynthesis"" pathways. Finally, the expression pattern of a selected group of candidate signature genes for Prometabola, including vestigial, methoprene-tolerant, wingless, and broad-complex were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR analysis. The Q-PCR analysis of larval, subimaginal, and imaginal stages of C. viridulum suggests that the development of mayflies more closely resembles hemimetamorphosis than holometamorphosis.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qin Si"", ids = ""48984208""); list(name = ""Juan-Yan Luo"", ids = ""18129997""); list(name = ""Ze Hu"", ids = ""49941592""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""39664496""); list(name = ""Chang-Fa Zhou"", ids = ""5429761"")",095e5eeb879df62b4b92e630082ac8efcc95d9bc; 5db6a250d5f9539a50915a82726c0daf03d66801; be13e9559e416b8a44ed50bbe6f46e53a1d1f38d,a688e1c477bcc8bde50e5338e1126e257857d97f; 6f79ec0c77cabea8bcf153cd38ba9bc5a793965e; a2f71b2d0edda572f310d95fe547ff1f51e68d55; 08979242d9ae8743ae725f426f0a4a6106627f24; cea34158ddd4270a1ccba549800a07cce7525d18; a2a4aa48bd22ea776b34288910554cde954bd2e6; ec27a1f0b5655736eaa7ef20cef274a75fa8ba14; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; 55f0a4f7e1eb3ad17d32f5f9ea9ead3c89c664ab; 5d8ca49cc139f365a07e0fc130e229398bc4fa85; 3040ac52b3154de53a831715f2ce7f4e7d3d723b; d908f1a7c0311f39ca876c7297ebad46672a5aab; edc079300a94f170af8cc11a40c1a65883a50423; 88e10c32e76322a033349f6aef71e20202957856; 3e7dce6271fae6665c8100d5b054017b35176ef5; a1df7feec40fa669488ff5ab579dee24cc79a7e8; 0d28f6e79581f7b0c28e05eb3d3ad428cc95204d; 3cb47dfe5f33633f08d801b82d3fe81d5d91e6d0; 324d8e37c360e0ed8353099ec7519262dcf80e6b; e81ca7ffe3329e9378b76fe2a147f581f6b1ade2; af1e2ae3092922c0051c7bfa8485d5b5db751271; 43e94b605c04a2e7c6b3926f624c38921544148c; 06cd930db580f30d4b078b8c9ae76c1e84cff2ee; 0b928ef0490ead17f47dc7a5039668250698699a; c7d640b287d74c4c9049097b6b66e9d66d2b7032; 852f040a055d262fa9647322cd66a56e33a73e02; f6f3ab1a72666a557f384f25503b825d5c28fefa; f17acab5b0ab9353ac084e84e7c8721eff0ead96; 389b14b554d051e7f46aebc7ed5b596f205ea42d; f1a9ae501575363f79e555c5bf6daa3de2f093b2; 01a85511cb00270245b678ae3525f9606ad47958; e8f87309cbe5f5d482ba3ec8cb9885cd58c2b658; e175a92833aa4d53a9cd95b9ff3b69e1c43130bd; 87b757dd3c0c5e3af351a6fcf16dd3f21278fcdb; be63c7ac091624e9e17a7afdc5c28d9f81415823; a1f2f9bd6d1d89fb2f8e4306829b558276ccae54; 12fd3129573fadaa9af636c04d0cc19b075cd2f8; 722179d4f64c606c705c71db7b1c03f8c48d6a46; a946f03d1691bc9aedc33e867913ebd7f6e6a2f2; 923822d2634be6097cadedaa6733bc2d1c2fd945; 2fa8130b1fed878e69329dba1ffcb7aa38ecf518; 9e80b9ac8e532591be2c542f94bb3d8e974d5d30; 97137b65d41e7a24864272362cc5f54c8c961e4d; 619717c5e23f4e819a5b0a873599ad14bce0ee94; dfc06f77eb60b97e9ff4e4e0e7c9946637f1e659; 30f1a8ebbac1f4decccc1b0de33dc37f39ebeb18; cd142036ce1a36744dea279228c708773a59f23f; efdcb983d1e388420344899593bfd73769a47ae8; ec912dc94e715c54fab37c3bb7604b1b95b195b2; bec18756545b1351eece9d0c80f5304cdee8c19d; 05b7cdafb92ff6acfe8af50066b63c4fda67dba8,PLoS ONE,12,
e0a6e9054f97a6ab8592052460b4b84297233e99,False Discovery Rate Smoothing,"ABSTRACTWe present false discovery rate (FDR) smoothing, an empirical-Bayes method for exploiting spatial structure in large multiple-testing problems. FDR smoothing automatically finds spatially localized regions of significant test statistics. It then relaxes the threshold of statistical significance within these regions, and tightens it elsewhere, in a manner that controls the overall false discovery rate at a given level. This results in increased power and cleaner spatial separation of signals from noise. The approach requires solving a nonstandard high-dimensional optimization problem, for which an efficient augmented-Lagrangian algorithm is presented. In simulation studies, FDR smoothing exhibits state-of-the-art performance at modest computational cost. In particular, it is shown to be far more robust than existing methods for spatially dependent multiple testing. We also apply the method to a dataset from an fMRI experiment on spatial working memory, where it detects patterns that are much more b...",2014,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Wesley Tansey"", ids = ""145305182""); list(name = ""Oluwasanmi Koyejo"", ids = ""143812875""); list(name = ""Russell A.

0e1a208d7ef393571c1e0221839737d964bd1f3f,Practical Guidelines for the Comprehensive Analysis of ChIP-seq Data,"Mapping the chromosomal locations of transcription factors, nucleosomes, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling enzymes, chaperones, and polymerases is one of the key tasks of modern biology, as evidenced by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project. To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard methodology. Mapping such protein-DNA interactions in vivo using ChIP-seq presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of ChIP-seq data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in ChIP-seq data analysis. We present a concise workflow for the analysis of ChIP-seq data in Figure 1 that complements and expands on the recommendations of the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. Each step in the workflow is described in detail in the following sections.",2013,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Timothy Bailey"", ids = ""145327986""); list(name = ""Pawel Krajewski"", ids = ""153419566"");

12e44cbe9ea21bf84c1a07b083d7509632e698ef,"AMPK variant, a candidate of novel predictor for chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis using TRIBE, MAVERICC and FIRE3.","AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key sensor of energy homeostasis and regulates cell metabolism, proliferation and chemotherapy/radiotherapy sensitivities. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the AMPK pathway-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We analyzed a total of 884 patients with mCRC enrolled in three randomized clinical trials (TRIBE, MAVERICC and FIRE-3: where patients were treated with FOLFIRI, mFOLFOX6 or FOLFOXIRI combined with bevacizumab or cetuximab as the first-line chemotherapy). The association between AMPK pathway-related SNPs and clinical outcomes was analyzed across the six treatment cohorts, using a meta-analysis approach. Our meta-analysis showed that AMPK pathway had significant associations with progression-free survival (PFS; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and overall survival (OS; pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), but not with tumor response (TR; pâ€‰=â€‰0.220): PRKAA1 rs13361707 was significantly associated with favorable PFS (log HRâ€‰=â€‰-0.219, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.073, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), as well as PRKAA1 rs10074991 (log HRâ€‰=â€‰-0.215, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.073, pâ€‰=â€‰0.003), and there were suggestive associations of PRKAG1 rs1138908 with unfavorable OS (log HRâ€‰=â€‰0.170, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.083, pâ€‰=â€‰0.041), and of UBE2O rs3803739 with unfavorable PFS (log HRâ€‰=â€‰0.137, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.068, pâ€‰=â€‰0.042) and OS (log HRâ€‰=â€‰0.210, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.077, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), although these results were not significant after false discovery rate adjustment. AMPK pathway-related SNPs may be predictors for chemotherapy in mCRC.

0c5cf37d8bb54aa09c685ad132751b487b07e20b,Cerebral perfusion abnormality in narcolepsy with cataplexy,"To investigate abnormal cerebral perfusion in narcoleptics with cataplexy, 25 narcoleptics with cataplexy and 25 normal controls were enrolled in this study. Cerebral perfusion was measured by brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer. Patients and normal controls had not received any medication prior to the SPECT scan. Differences in cerebral perfusion between narcoleptics and normal controls were subjected to statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. Overnight polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were performed in all patients. Brain SPECT was carried out on all patients and normal controls during the waking state. Clinical symptoms and MSLT results of all patients are in accord with the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria for narcolepsy. MSLT showed a short mean sleep latency (1.69 +/- 1.0 min) and 2-5 sleep onset REM periods in individual patient. SPM analysis of brain SPECT showed hypoperfusion of the bilateral anterior hypothalami, caudate nuclei, and pulvinar nuclei of thalami, parts of the dorsolateral/ventromedial prefrontal cortices, parahippocampal gyri, and cingulate gyri in narcoleptics [P < 0.05 by Student's t test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction]. Significant hypoperfusion in the white matter of frontal and parietal lobes was also noted in narcoleptics. This study shows reduced cerebral perfusion in subcortical structures and cortical areas in narcoleptics. The distribution of abnormal cerebral perfusion is concordant with the pathway of the cerebral hypocretin system and may explain the characteristic features of narcolepsy, i.e., cataplexy, emotional lability, and attention deficit.",2005,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Eun Yeon Joo"", ids = ""1920146""); list(name = ""Seung Bong Hong"", ids = ""3018797""); list(name = ""Woo Suk Tae"", ids = ""5316406""); list(name = ""Jee Hyun Kim"", ids = ""2707528""); list(name = ""Sun Jung Han"", ids = ""3642111""); list(name = ""Yong Won Cho"", ids = ""2108882""); list(name = ""Chang Ho Yoon"", ids = ""38343644""); list(name = ""Sung Ik Lee"", ids = ""9285926""); list(name = ""Mann Hyung Lee"", ids = ""46293684""); list(name = ""Kyung Han Lee"", ids = ""5284828""); list(name = ""Myoung-Hee Kim"", ids = ""2039362""); list(name = ""Byung Tae Kim"", ids = ""4866505""); list(name = ""Leen Kim"", ids = ""5474937"")",63b0b7b04ea247f4075289fc52285c161b790f9c; 258dbb3fed2b510a5632e8b6ea049f87b1fe0ad9; 6a2f671ebf2bf77d5a7993844de76fca09984a2b; 693fe816e2453a33b9550fffb0c5990c609c1d9c; 6d75e05e3192e83967c44231d934c4865337c010; f456200dc61de68bf4e3d4b9970e142e4f89feb5; ea178319d8f7568cbbdb02fd12b728214673bc0c; b9f613060347eefd7430a407e6e8298ce45d1133; 870e88f6c47ea97303cffdcaf495a2930de28a9b; e81bb77b95c89c93eda113b7b4e6bbba6f98fd08; 1be343f88a5ed5fdaccd99cc98150e2a34cb0fdd; eb7285354d6ecf15232255b7babe16d041ae3047; fbf7dd9358ff167f2be16f536ad7953964454438; 731ceeccd55df0ff155c95d119a429ee0726b605; c638ad88fb5fee720f69b50bdba509aa2f5db221; a3f3c4933b605ae4d79ad7622a539c64824eb531; 2117d3ae22017cbd38ce0c31d3e163e84918c2ab; dc592a27d90bb568729c1ae7ab6ed39ba31f50c3; 111f1afea78fb2d381f08a95f92f2380319e0317; ad427970cbaa9e67bd743357f43156d65c60f883; a40ba77f6ccb9c3ba455935f3a7be80a0463f394; 0830cde50d19ad7dcc44cca0616161c6e5d8b426; dc327e77f54c4a4988d80a30dc93f5cb64277965; e0a22c88968086f209117da19a0785905b040e8c; c8c59dc27b0e4add5196d0c9656ac7eb641df485; bcba7f53a1979ad1e17d9d2ab9a6879d90a7bbec; 7faf1fa25536d0a1a81d91dd3a505f27c0bd336e; eb5720fddacb0a9a56ed47ab43be9c5d6144b681; 14e9ce7d0a325ac604308403b9be6c7d3cac719e; 000b5fe3c6caa0156f7f016c36396baef340a91f; 1cf6a7dfa12c8950ac235743dc752ae2d0b92ad3; cd8b4bfc27b30dbc07570176c16c86cef6ee9fa9; c980ac14a30fbf4a16717bf85f1e228e267cb2d5; 0ad7eeed6488fb371656b2ba35006f6b304ed3eb; f21a547fb65ef326d09af2d4cd1c9d6295571dd7; 514a820c3fef33e78f57eec912d631f936f0d8dc; 93bdeef0752c3b9c2b6628ef01dce09e9abb1bc7; af9d6b4f825b0029d41e4c13d0f942133bbed791; c8c98e58702706dff570d7a9d75ea7b5eb765642; 12f04a98e8262b8ecfe1a9dd4b048ef9aaaab2fa; 4ef9a94093261969688002b9afca9f06f8df73b5; b19f4b74d9adb0d6aa45290f6ba9b0c0afe404d5; db0c7d066c6b5dda812682fd26b5197c051546df; ea1e0335f014f4a46de97fe18223852c3a40e0d8,,NeuroImage,28,410-416
50efdf5c2782d1bd7d46edcdedf1b29e617ed966,Genome-wide CNV analysis reveals variants associated with growth traits in Bos indicus,"BackgroundApart from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), copy number variation (CNV) is another important type of genetic variation, which may affect growth traits and play key roles for the production of beef cattle. To date, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CNV and body traits in beef cattle has been reported, so the present study aimed to investigate this type of association in one of the most important cattle subspecies: Bos indicus (Nellore breed).ResultsWe have used intensity data from over 700,000 SNP probes across the bovine genome to detect common CNVs in a sample of 2230 Nellore cattle, and performed GWAS between the detected CNVs and nine growth traits. After filtering for frequency and length, a total of 231 CNVs ranging from 894Â bp to 4,855,088Â bp were kept and tested as predictors for each growth trait using linear regression analysis with principal components correction. There were 49 significant associations identified among 17 CNVs and seven body traits after false discovery rate correction (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Among the 17 CNVs, three were significant or marginally significant for all the traits. We have compared the locations of associated CNVs with quantitative trait locus and the RefGene database, and found two sets of 9 CNVs overlapping with either known QTLs or genes, respectively. The gene overlapping with CNV100, KCNJ12, is a functional candidate for muscle development and plays critical roles in muscling traits.ConclusionThis study presents the first CNV-based GWAS of growth traits using high density SNP microarray data in cattle. We detected 17 CNVs significantly associated with seven growth traits and one of them (CNV100) may be involved in growth traits through KCNJ12.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yang Zhou"", ids = ""19989278""); list(name = ""Yuri Tani Utsunomiya"", ids = ""35371104""); list(name = ""Lingyang Xu"", ids = ""2072646""); list(name = ""El Hamidi A.

318c0c5383d12e0a89dd9e65c606eccac2d777dd,Valproic acid induces prosurvival transcriptomic changes in swine subjected to traumatic injury and hemorrhagic shock,"BACKGROUND Valproic acid (VPA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that improves outcomes in large animal models of trauma. However, its protective mechanism of action is not completely understood. We sought to characterize the genetic changes induced by VPA treatment following traumatic injuries. METHODS Six female Yorkshire swine were subjected to traumatic brain injury (controlled cortical impact), polytrauma (liver and splenic laceration, rib fracture, rectus crush), and hemorrhagic shock (HS, 40% total blood volume). Following 2 hours of HS, animals were randomized to resuscitation with normal saline (NS) or NS + 150 mg/kg of intravenous VPA (n = 3/cohort, 18 samples total). Blood samples were collected for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at three distinct time points: baseline, 6 hours following injuries, and on postinjury day 1. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and sequenced. Differential expression analysis (false discovery rate < 0.001 and p value <0.001) and gene set enrichment (Panther Gene Ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) was used to compare VPA to nonâ€“VPA-treated animals. RESULTS A total of 628 differentially expressed RNA transcripts were identified, 412 of which were used for analysis. There was no difference between treatment groups at baseline. The VPA-induced genetic changes were similar at 6 hours and on postinjury day 1. Upregulated genes were associated with gene expression (p 2.13E-34), cellular development (1.19E-33), cellular growth and proliferation (1.25E-30), and glucocorticoid receptor signaling (8.6E-21). Downregulated genes were associated with cell cycle checkpoint regulation (3.64E-22), apoptosis signaling (6.54E-21), acute phase response signaling (5.84E-23), and the inflammasome pathway (1.7E-19). CONCLUSION In injured swine, VPA increases the expression of genes associated with cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation and decreases those associated with cell death and inflammation. These genetic changes could explain the superior clinical outcomes in VPA-treated animals, including smaller brain lesion size and improved neurologic recovery.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Patrick E.

acff6d1d4ab9de0d41092512b7c10739aad36a9e,Stemness in human embryonic stem cells,"Stem cells are cells that have a unique ability to divide for an indefinite period. Additionally, they can give rise to a plethora of specialized cell types. The advent of high-throughput technologies made it possible to investigate gene expression on a large scale. This enabled scientists to perform comprehensive gene profiling studies of stem cells. Several authors have suggested that there might be a common set of genes that control the stemness of stem cells. In this study, we suggest that â€stemnessâ€ genes that are related to â€stemnessâ€ characteristics show a statistically significant down-regulation between undifferentiated and differentiated cells. For this we have analyzed microarray data from five different cell lines and compared their global expression profiles. Common down-regulated transcripts among those data sets were de- rived by using a well-established gene expression analysis procedure called Significance Analysis of Microarrays. Since all three data sets were provided by Cellartis AB, the derived list of common transcripts was subsequently compared with an external study. Moreover, we also performed a comparison with down-regulated genes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. This was done to determine if there is a common set of stemness genes even across distinct species. Re- sults were further evaluated using a comprehensive data-set from a study by Skottman et al. (2005). All results where compared uti- lizing using a range of false discovery rate threshold values and the results were subsequently used for gene ontology term enrichment. GO terms where utilized to functionally annotate and classify those embryonic stem cell transcripts, that were found to be common in all data-sets and identify over-represented biological processes related to those genes.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Daniel Jurczak"", ids = ""49821863"")",,6fe9507de2ccd579d3707096a77ff8d9113c1d01; a4efe7499f2aeb456c3721de280251e8e0df6a15; f599f666c269578b36dff554dc0b5e0e1a0c5c7c; 8fb79d3b3be411eeb4e614cd8b831cb48fbe55a8; 2a837fc1c9d9c046b7e98aeba11783059e03cf55; 197f6d1baeffa438366817ab07024b5758fd0494; 891866af085281661f3a9da997efd74f5b4771aa; 07ca460980816b256b62e864590006500999ddc2; 3589ed812145742a0aff07225d6f8ce0f4502a44; 92fcc5b6a57573d93f9fdedf406d883befea81b3; e6cf676dcf595a0eed18c9da9fdd8f2d2c3dab06; da02eb436cd38b659ffee193a7f0681f799a215a; d95e800434451542a7df2209191d83ee67eb2620; 3417fad19aa8daeb2bf4bcbbe99f8df0c09f8e73; 885e7a1185c56dd7a728e4b3ded56c7357882d29; 291969cd7420f04bdbeaf4ace4f806ab0d4d77a0; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 75ca252b6c7226f0ff978b3c695f200748fb0536; 80e394ee3e1834091596e8b55c9ad9bf11456e09; 6c2534403b4b13cba2faa6403491777261ef20ac; d0a47c8c9c4213edd24a120a6912ebc08e348a19; e3fc1ce7cf4660fa8e56d14f0da52588c77d85e2; 308f079cd7f6dbb3bc892937b260e38e0f00acc1; 19190d05304eed116dc2b47bd5ae849feefd9a60; 30eecc8a7b7346a5e0c3a6648b0e156faad3a786; 7e20c5bb175d63a00001370faab82e57d498f82c; ef27a9ebf8cdfc15bb7def4a64d2319737afd0da; 5c0b24e0468f66de0b126242b0fcdd90af526806; b3e896944a0cd5f5e611ef0690e71b5aea64fd9a; de59e9333c8d7193f0877728c9486ab586d30335; 29afccf350d7c43044f74b83f00348a08c5d8d78; 7d0fdb068e651d1c9f35703cbb23d262f5af0b7d; 6ff846bf5732a3812d306f77dcb40e7e6bc0900e; 6fae977d40b90ff1acfd412936c595848e594300; 63f284d7a648cbf4abcb8cba44ea0d5afbb86d56; 716624454ec5ddf3827d81bd5959306089133397; 85391cb5f8cb84419e8e41ed84241266548a78c8; 178e55a6ef96feeefe5c34b1822f4df9aed2a049; 4120f0c1e64ae78d4c2900a2abf171989d71a055; 4341253e39f3a905775dae782503c507d2a46cdb; bb8bc700304eb5d119d73769c73d404975a7c0f9; daecec8eaebb89098d6432d9181da89518a7a443,,,
86fd40200a0325a73c434d698a6f947eecb206e6,Predicting Co-Complexed Protein Pairs from Heterogeneous Data,"Proteins do not carry out their functions alone. Instead, they often act by participating in macromolecular complexes and play different functional roles depending on the other members of the complex. It is therefore interesting to identify co-complex relationships. Although protein complexes can be identified in a high-throughput manner by experimental technologies such as affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (APMS), these large-scale datasets often suffer from high false positive and false negative rates. Here, we present a computational method that predicts co-complexed protein pair (CCPP) relationships using kernel methods from heterogeneous data sources. We show that a diffusion kernel based on random walks on the full network topology yields good performance in predicting CCPPs from protein interaction networks. In the setting of direct ranking, a diffusion kernel performs much better than the mutual clustering coefficient. In the setting of SVM classifiers, a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel. We also show that combination of complementary information improves the performance of our CCPP recognizer. A summation of three diffusion kernels based on two-hybrid, APMS, and genetic interaction networks and three sequence kernels achieves better performance than the sequence kernels or diffusion kernels alone. Inclusion of additional features achieves a still better ROC(50) of 0.937. Assuming a negative-to-positive ratio of 600ratio1, the final classifier achieves 89.3% coverage at an estimated false discovery rate of 10%. Finally, we applied our prediction method to two recently described APMS datasets. We find that our predicted positives are highly enriched with CCPPs that are identified by both datasets, suggesting that our method successfully identifies true CCPPs. An SVM classifier trained from heterogeneous data sources provides accurate predictions of CCPPs in yeast. This computational method thereby provides an inexpensive method for identifying protein complexes that extends and complements high-throughput experimental data.",2008,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Jian Qiu"", ids = ""144983963"");

290401f5c02c6fc4280a45906be84f54ae2b906d,Deep sequencing identifies novel regulatory variants in the distal promoter region of the dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase gene.,"OBJECTIVE
Dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase (DBH), an enzyme that converts dopamine into norepinephrine, is a drug target in cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed to identify functional variants in this gene by deep sequencing and enzyme phenotyping in an Indian cohort.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Targeted resequencing of 12 exons and 10â€‰kb upstream sequences of DBH in healthy volunteers (n=50) was performed using the Ion Personal Genome Machine System. Enzyme quantity and activity in their sera samples were determined by ELISA and ultra performance liquid chromatography, respectively. The association of markers with phenotypes was determined using Matrix eQTL. Global P-values for haplotypes generated using UNPHASED 3.1.5 were graphed using GrASP v.082 beta.


RESULTS
Of the 49 variants identified, nine were novel (minor allele frequencyâ‰¥0.01). Though individual markers associated with enzyme quantity did not withstand multiple corrections, a novel distal promoter block driven by rs113249250 (global P=1.5Ã—10) was associated. Of the nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with enzyme activity, rs3025369, rs1076151 and rs1611115, all from the upstream region, withstood false discovery rate correction (false discovery rate=0.03, 0.03 and 2.9Ã—10, respectively). Conditioning for rs1611115 identified rs1989787 also to affect activity. Importantly, we report an association of a novel haplotype block distal to rs1076151 driven by rs3025369 (global P=8.9Ã—10) with enzyme activity.

However, significant gaps in knowledge exist in the understanding of consequences of glucose load during pregnancy, a state of insulin resistance. Using high dimensional protein arrays, we conducted a pilot proof-of-concept and feasibility study to investigate profiles of 120 plasma proteins in pre- and post- 50-gram oral glucose challenge samples. Participants (N = 10) were selected from among women enrolled in a pregnancy cohort. Differences in plasma protein concentrations between pre- and post-glucose load challenge samples were evaluated using Student's T-test (paired) and mean fold change comparisons. Multiple testing adjusted p-values (i.e., false discovery rate q values) were computed using Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) corrections. Plasma haptoglobulin, epidermal growth factor, hemoglobin, thrombospondin-1, and S100 protein concentrations were two to five fold higher in post-glucose load compared with pre-glucose load samples (all q-values <0.05). Among women aged >31 years (above median), post-load S100 protein was elevated 9.92-fold above pre-load concentrations, while it was elevated 4.10-fold among women aged <31 years (below median). Similarly, among women with post-load glucose concentrations <101mg/dl (below median), S100 was elevated 8.26-fold while it was elevated 3.28 fold among women with post-load glucose concentrations >101mg/dl (above median). Our study findings suggest that post-glucose load changes in plasma biomarkers represent a diverse set of cellular responses including receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), inflammation, oxidative stress and adipogenesis, during mid-pregnancy.

5889ad134e280e5d9c20e7f143100fd798af226f,A Genoproteomic Approach to Detect Peptide Markers of Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens.,"BACKGROUND
Rapid identification of respiratory pathogens may facilitate targeted antimicrobial therapy. Direct identification of bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is confounded by interfering substances. We describe a method to identify unique peptide markers of 5 gram-negative bacteria by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for direct pathogen identification in BAL.


METHODS
In silico translation and digestion were performed on 14-25 whole genomes representing strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Peptides constituting theoretical core peptidomes in each were identified. Rapid tryptic digestion was performed; peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and compared with the theoretical core peptidomes. High-confidence core peptides (false discovery rate <1%) were identified and analyzed with the lowest common ancestor search to yield potential species-specific peptide markers. The species specificity of each peptide was verified with protein BLAST. Further, 1 or 2 pathogens were serially diluted into pooled inflamed BAL, and a targeted LC-MS/MS assay was used to detect 25 peptides simultaneously.


RESULTS
Five unique peptides with the highest abundance for each pathogen distinguished these pathogens with varied detection sensitivities. Peptide markers for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, when spiked simultaneously into inflamed BAL, were detected with as few as 3.6 (0.2) Ã— 103 and 2.2 (0.6) Ã— 103 colony-forming units, respectively, by targeted LC-MS/MS.


CONCLUSIONS
This proof-of-concept study shows the feasibility of identifying unique peptides in BAL for 5 gram-negative bacterial pathogens, and it may provide a novel approach for rapid direct identification of bacterial pathogens in BAL.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Honghui Wang"", ids = ""49528759""); list(name = ""Steven K.

We find that SPMâ€™s minimum statistic inferences [1] are often misinterpreted and, in other work, we describe a simple method to make inferences on the â€œconjunction nullâ€ using the minimum statistic ([2] & Poster WE137). In this work we describe a new method for conjunction inference that doesnâ€™t use the minimum statistic. We propose using Bayesian methods to compute the posterior probability of the conjunction null. In lieu of a full Bayesian model, we show how the Positive False Discovery Rate (pFDR) can be used to compute such a posterior probability. We describe the method and apply it to a conjunction analysis from an fMRI study of inhibition.",2002,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Thomas E. Nichols"", ids = ""2358653""); list(name = ""Tor D.

1b368c917666525ca697d23e958cc4a6c3dfb7ac,Gene expression patterns within cell lines are predictive of chemosensitivity,"BackgroundThe NCI has undertaken a twenty-year project to characterize compound sensitivity patterns in a selected set of sixty tumor derived cell lines. Previous studies have explored the relationship between compound sensitivity patterns to gene expression, protein expression, and DNA copy number for these same cell lines. A strong correlation between the pattern of expression of a biomarker and sensitivity to a compound could suggest a clinically interesting biological relationship between the two.ResultsWe isolated RNA's and measured expression of 40000 genes using cDNA microarrays from the fifty-nine publicly available cell lines. Analysis of this data set in comparison with published gene expression data sets demonstrates a high degree of reproducibility in expression level measurements even using completely independent RNA preparations and array technologies. Using the fifty-nine cell lines for discovery and an additional seven cell lines for which extensive compound sensitivity data were available as a test set, we determined that gene-compound pairs with a correlation coefficient above 0.6 had a false discovery rate of approximately 5%. Large scale features of the gene expression and chemosensitivity data, such as tissue of origin and other physiological factors, did not seem to explain the majority of correlations between gene and compound patterns.ConclusionA comparison of gene expression and compound sensitivity in panels of cell lines was demonstrated to have a relatively high validation and low false discovery rate supporting the use of this approach and datasets for identifying candidate biomarkers and targeted biologically active compounds.",2007,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Brian Z.

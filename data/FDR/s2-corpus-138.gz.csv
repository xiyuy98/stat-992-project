56c2b288c1701fc2786a00c87fc34234c164173c,Analysis of Microbiome Data in the Presence of Excess Zeros,"Motivation: An important feature of microbiome count data is the presence of a large number of zeros. A common strategy to handle these excess zeros is to add a small number called pseudo-count (e.g., 1). Other strategies include using various probability models to model the excess zero counts. Although adding a pseudo-count is simple and widely used, as demonstrated in this paper, it is not ideal. On the other hand, methods that model excess zeros using a probability model often make an implicit assumption that all zeros can be explained by a common probability models. As described in this article, this is not always recommended as there are potentially three types/sources of zeros in a microbiome data. The purpose of this paper is to develop a simple methodology to identify and accomodate three different types of zeros and to test hypotheses regarding the relative abundance of taxa in two or more experimental groups. Another major contribution of this paper is to perform constrained (directional or ordered) inference when there are more than two ordered experimental groups (e.g., subjects ordered by diet or age groups or environmental exposure groups). As far as we know this is the first paper that addresses such problems in the analysis of microbiome data. Results: Using extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology not only controls the false discovery rate at a desired level of significance while competing well in terms of power with DESeq2, a popular procedure derived from RNASeq literature. As expected, the method using pseudo-counts tends to be very conservative and the classical t-test that ignores the underlying simplex structure in the data has an inflated FDR.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Abhishek Kaul"", ids = ""27211953""); list(name = ""Siddhartha Sankar Mandal"", ids = ""5137090""); list(name = ""Ori Davidov"", ids = ""1812586""); list(name = ""Shyamal Das Peddada"", ids = ""145423393"")",1459a8b819339108edb69802b456c22c83986cfd; 1cee7244ebb8e7d1d15c74ec72ae7e817ece4ba0; 84532cb6fd2787f5d5d13a3ece21c7aa392eac61; 688462593e334c09cc56f91f1e246897787b71d9; f80fd963066ba7f85ee4b03ae8e6fbbe4dfda340; 4a50e121e5b8b6337f12eb0e1888fd7984d5443d; f763d2764bc22308698fea4383e81b558b08eb90; 2fc62f7eba4871aa8c7f6147fb9691789fc62453; 0a19d0ac66457266e23c576cd201fd150fe60eb2; 76bdb19d50d831d9c7e6b43f02c47df44450fbb1; d8cf1febc1ef0c5eff6d4309faeaac24275ca1f5; 8535c85bc0beabcf79a2029cfc22c242d25954e6; 043863da778c1a2e10184e2921b13a46191c7328; 5a79c46d3d68a3cbb280826f330818a1f08327e1; dd5467915abecead7479ba09ebb0254f8321c028,9bf0123dca62945783a55a99d712e93357a38539; bb1253adb11687da327fdf588cc79d6b290a41b0; 370ed2c725f14753fefc20f41257eea80383a74a; 7ce10624b09c54d2604f60b4c2d48409201fcc5b; 596fc070a4590317fb95c602c69bc28ab779b50b; cb5e5d8960575c477825952365925255292bb9d3; 97b78aadbb73f3d424da1449817e9d35b9e9bb05; 53cc88f6ec126da5276c2391de9db861af1769aa; 827b315822032ee79ceec4f6b9d2e4272d6787f6; 19f01d415146e6ff4c9ee711cda5b90b7fefb601; 649f39d6605da399bbba133b69bfc53543e456a1; b4d989c18850da725f7d80ccf95d20fa041de60f; 54a6d777e3a84e46f1c74bc9a0482a7307bd79c7; d381f4cbbe79b3f80a8261ecf8407b85712c6419; 0fb708b165f5000a3f611b36e0b93b92abe4864c; a6e0739455352b0be05e22548bff81f5b1f80788; c8bea262e458b39c69ee318831bf8546426fca80; de8578bfb43861ce8b679f95952a03b567d8db9c; 7c7d6bd2a339aaf02043f81c396efd9c953b8001,Frontiers in Microbiology,8,
1cba898115f7a713e664b5c7e2cf9cd4fed2b173,Genetic variability of transcript abundance in pig skeletal muscle at slaughter: relationships with meat quality traits.,"A family structured population of 325 pigs (females and barrows) was produced as an intercross between 2 commercial sire lines and was subjected to a systematic transcriptome analysis of LM samples obtained shortly after slaughter. Additionally, measurements of meat quality traits of fresh and cooked loin were gathered from the same animals. The transcriptome analysis was achieved by microarray hybridization, using a custom repertoire of 15,000 6mer DNA probes targeting transcripts expressed in growing pig skeletal muscle. These data allowed us to estimate the heritability of expression abundance for each of the quantified RNA species. The abundance of 9,765 RNA was estimated as heritable with a false discovery rate of 5%, from which 1,174 were deemed as highly heritable (h(2) > 0.50). We also observed a large number of transcripts whose LM expression abundance is genetically correlated with 4 meat quality traits: the loin pH measured at 45 min postmortem (pH45), 253 transcripts; the loin cooking loss (CL), 134 transcripts; the cooked loin shear force (SFc), 184 transcripts; and the loin color redness (a*) value, 190 transcripts. Heritable and meat quality genetically correlated transcripts showed an over-representation of biological processes involved in the induction of apoptosis (genetically correlated with CL), complement activation (genetically correlated with SFc), glucose metabolism (genetically correlated with a*), and cation channel activity (genetically correlated with pH45). Overall, the biological functions highlighted in the highly heritable transcripts and the lack of transcript that would be genetically correlated with LM glycolytic potential suggest that the genetic variability of the LM postmortem transcriptome is focused on muscle tissue response to postmortem ischemia and reflects more distantly the antemortem muscle physiology. Because of the contrasting distributions of the genetic correlations between LM RNA concentrations and the different meat quality traits studied, indirect selection strategies of meat quality traits based on measurements of selected LM RNA species could be only proposed for a subset of the analyzed meat characteristics (pH45, SFc, a*, CL). A substantial improvement in the efficiency of selection for these meat quality traits could result from measuring muscle RNA concentrations on selection candidates, if the same genetic parameters can be verified using in vivo-sampled muscles.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Pascal ChÃ©rel"", ids = ""4154729""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©ric HÃ©rault"", ids = ""3746493""); list(name = ""Annie Vincent"", ids = ""144729472""); list(name = ""Pascale Le Roy"", ids = ""10021879""); list(name = ""Marie Damon"", ids = ""50392377"")",092ce978a4a9844222e8757ec04ec8661056a28a; 2b8084291560ad2124eb834ef8f712d559b952c4; cb123060929013546522afa074e2394c6f96169e; e6f8db9d07d7e5dda89d466b1feed2cf0f41325a; ba51e012df6cc9ca88c60c0f9e7601319cc42dca,53c7de9b45f6305e78ceaff7c2a8ea201713c757; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; ebd485b55a8a5d3ef51c4465a8a74d07a73d468c; bb76a7098c313d854db72624ac1f025c3ad8a477; 6c704d32435f42cdc6c159ac7b0b098fb51481de; f876b9b99eae81e57782fb7d8b508bf48eb4036d; 842d9f2353664fdcc3354300a11da8620c1b761a; cd6287ec06b127b199c41f908edddb4d9365af69; d4fdd1f3f11aef7270a09a8e621eccc1f7219664; 2a1438ef6ebff9e0a409798cd43c634f712bc62f; c528a65faf6637ad0351afb51f7cb8282756c0fe; 9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; f030d83780d99235c565a9363ff1b3893b542aa5; 82aa307c3963e26e622b132e128e3beadb2a972f; a55e277d6642475a5320ff98dfd00195c438def7; 2f3c6e4c09d9797119a03bac9f3623df9730aa35; 273dce646d9e75ec638edd8e4196f2ecf8857e85; 739b6844e716a99ac127be3a13d907885537627a; e0486442d99411608835dfd865ff784d25141f67; cc1d04fcff7bcb66780d26d55db5a9025cfa7b17; b5b9ed5daa5ff8f28d7724f8001796dd7d51d0fb,Journal of animal science,90 3,"

f9e9c2f800b199f2477739925a85607e8804b366,Discovering functional impacts of miRNAs in cancers using a causal deep learning model,"BackgroundMicro-RNAs (miRNAs) play a significant role in regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions such as cancers. However, it remains a challenging problem to discover the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of a miRNA in a data driven fashion. On one hand, sequence-based methods for predicting miRNA targets tend to make too many false positive calls. On the other hand, analyzing expression correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs cannot establish whether relationship between a pair of correlated miRNA and mRNA is causal.MethodsIn this study, we designed a deep learning model, referred to as miRNA causal deep net (mCADET), which aims to explicitly represent two types of statistical relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs: correlation resulting from confounded co-regulation and correlation as a result of causal regulation. The model utilizes a deep neural network to simulate transcription mechanism that leads to co-expression of miRNA and mRNA, and, in addition, it also contains directed edges from miRNAs to mRNAs to capture causal relationships among them.ResultsWe trained the mCADET model using pan-cancer miRNA and mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to investigate mechanism of co-expression and causal interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative analyses of the results indicate that the mCADET significantly outperforms conventional deep learning models when modeling combined miRNA and mRNA expression data, indicating its superior capability of capturing the high-order statistical structures in the data. Qualitative analysis of predicted targets of miRNAs indicate that predictions by mCADET agree well with existing knowledge. Finally, the predictions by mCADET have a significantly lower false discovery rate and better overall accuracy in comparison to sequence-based and correlation-based methods when comparing to experimental results.ConclusionThe mCADET model can simultaneously infer the states of cellular signaling system regulating co-expression of miRNAs and mRNAs, while capturing their causal relationships in a data-driven fashion.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lujia Chen"", ids = ""46308125""); list(name = ""Xinghua Lu"", ids = ""50085315"")",,b6e325fddc5f98e0da4a7171c4a183ca0a04ae56; 4032cb28f726f41a9c93abfa434d0d7eee3a3850; 14a574659a7027ae0f0ea66ae50384857410f0c9; c6af0570663fc6cff278547f35b4b7bb33bbe5c7; 22797dc5179171f9b61476a9499a80ea20b37276; 8c1f06689340bbbd5f56d90511a338ebc958c517; 1626c940a64ad96a7ed53d7d6c0df63c6696956b; b30a47d8a5027da4d8de41fdfd3607ded2461ce5; 0a460a7689175ceb2fd803ec985847c7e3ea93ae; 5298242a0b8013ab1e379bc69687895aeaf60222; b46acb21d7bdcd90773cd2db69d8515e98777e9f; 895949f16678943edb9721ec9da9e52769787968; fe614bb97b57edf18f59eabebdb9d0d05ad6caa1; 4f7b7b96b6443e3e1c2e7c0a61ebeba115c25510; feaece50ac2bfc236b96d3e8a000affe6b96f2a0; d23d476b3af17c50406a21354a8a49c7cf1ad246; 3c75c0493a55a9e892da39ed56af17e3b37c6f10; 346e14f3fd1025ca8ba533b839568215d3cc9aff; 8f7714e42d546d89d092e467532bcc66ebc90eea; 548ac9fff4e29cf75c1d7f93c7e818f629dd8200; 2a2cf15cc68628128bbcaeabb6c9cdf8a12c8e59; 202cbbf671743aefd380d2f23987bd46b9caaf97; e3999a46cb8aaf71131a77670da5c5c113aad01d; 066a65dd36d95bdeff06ef703ba30b0c28397cd0; 18770923b95dbd9033c7f3d69f362f28faa51ee0; f08ef16b18d5201cfe75300b398f66065b157b48; c25f12c2106cb0ed9fe3dec82ca5d76026610ad6; 17270622ab7af27669c9fea54611303a624675da; 9bab9721f58ad8c4cc1fba169c8c322d22be9e8e; 8978cf7574ceb35f4c3096be768c7547b28a35d0; f6c8eb38ddf58f2e709fc02ad4808c94ae26dbac; c81a5f7469419748daff6272230ed330001ee8f2; f6a883c9998531f258a44e455815a6a9b3a0da9c; 75ff6213c2e303d9835d1fa72c47ff8adbc5e5a7; 35d57140ba819134565fb78da59485f5245a8413; 2746310743557404f0ab73fafb78076761dccef5; 32babc3cc6a29d844cdaa78974659fda76c4e035; 4738fafa72a97c8b64e1ac74fdcf76e9cd6f6b7b,BMC Medical Genomics,11,
9418a925177fe9137b3117ae24e67b7c8c99e2bc,Estimating the False Discovery Rate Using Mixed Normal Distribution for Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes in Microarray Data Analysis,"The recent development of DNA microarray technology allows us to measure simultaneously the expression levels of thousands of genes and to identify truly correlated genes with anticancer drug response (differentially expressed genes) from many candidate genes. Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) is often used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), which is an index for optimizing the identifiability of differentially expressed genes, while the accuracy of the estimated FDR by SAM is not necessarily confirmed. We propose a new method for estimating the FDR assuming a mixed normal distribution on the test statistic and examine the performance of the proposed method and SAM using simulated data. The simulation results indicate that the accuracy of the estimated FDR by the proposed method and SAM, varied depending on the experimental conditions. We applied both methods to actual data comprised of expression levels of 12,625 genes of 10 responders and 14 non-responders to docetaxel for breast cancer. The proposed method identified 280 differentially expressed genes correlated with docetaxel response using a cut-off value for achieving FDR <0.01 to prevent false-positive genes, although 92 genes were previously thought to be correlated with docetaxel response ones.",2007,,"list(name = ""Akihiro Hirakawa"", ids = ""1881460""); list(name = ""Yasuhito Sato"", ids = ""11617389""); list(name = ""Takashi Sozu"", ids = ""6206634""); list(name = ""Chikuma Hamada"", ids = ""2999634""); list(name = ""Isao Yoshimura"", ids = ""144701290"")",5b666bf1999d5c6a5d937d920ce191cbbd4e5899; 901c7355df2863cc886e2405a1816b004f57e8a6; 7be92d0c375be4ada2b767465408a842948094d4; 37e418a07998914db6910f026715ffa0dc2c760d,,Cancer Informatics,3,

To study host gene expression and number of immune cells in liver tissues from patients with fulminant hepatitis E (FH-E).


METHODS
Microarray-based expression profiling was done using Illumina Human WG-6_v3_BeadChip arrays on post-mortem liver tissue from 5 patients with FH-E, and compared with similar tissue from 6 patients with fulminant hepatitis B (FH-B; disease controls) and normal liver tissue from 6 persons. Differential expression was defined as â‰¥ 2.0-fold change with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate below 0.05 using t-test in liver tissue from FH-B and FH-E, than healthy liver tissue. For some genes that showed differential expression in FH-E, microarray data were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Differentially expressed gene lists were then subjected to ""Gene Ontology"" analysis for biological processes, and pathway analysis using BioCarta database on the DAVID server. In addition, tissue sections were stained for CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD56(+) cells using indirect immunohistochemistry; cells staining positive for each of these markers were counted and compared between groups.


RESULTS
Compared to normal livers, those from patients with FH-E and FH-B showed differential expression of 3377 entities (up-regulated 1703, downregulated 1674) and 2572 entities (up 1164, down 1408), respectively. This included 2142 (up 896, down 1246) entities that were common between the two sets; most of these belonged to metabolic, hemostatic and complement pathways, which are active in normal livers. Gene expression data from livers of patients with FH-E but not those of FH-B showed activation of several immune response pathways, particularly those involving cytotoxic T cells. The fold-change values of mRNA for selected genes in livers from FH-E than in normal liver tissue determined using quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed excellent concordance with microarray analysis. At immunohistochemistry, CD8(+) T cells showed an increase in liver biopsies from both FH-E [median 53.4 per arbitrary unit area (range 31.2-99.9)] and FH-B [median 49.3 (19.3-51.0); P = 0.005] compared to control liver tissue [median 6.9 (3.1-14.9)].


CONCLUSION
FH-E patients show CD8(+) T cell infiltration and increased gene expression of cytotoxic T cell pathways in liver, suggesting a possible pathogenetic role for these cells.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anshu Naik"", ids = ""48940007""); list(name = ""Amit Goel"", ids = ""48133665""); list(name = ""Vinita Agrawal"", ids = ""13769858""); list(name = ""Aditya Narayan Sarangi"", ids = ""3493868""); list(name = ""Nanda Chhavi"", ids = ""5844429""); list(name = ""Vineeta Singh"", ids = ""49486992""); list(name = ""Shahid Jameel"", ids = ""1802502""); list(name = ""Rakesh Aggarwal"", ids = ""145443508"")",f8b0a318a32fd3cf9a42df9b4c7d09fd082678c8; 6c3ba9eb6383dc9c56617293b93c2d8bc1826a5b; 3c3baac6739440bfe959a6d819040d22a58469af,,World journal of gastroenterology,21 26,"

Currently, there are no pharmacotherapies in clinical use that favorably modify the post-TBI outcome, due in part to limited understanding of the mechanisms of TBI-induced pathologies. Our system biology analysis tested the hypothesis that chronic transcriptomics changes induced by TBI are controlled by altered DNA-methylation in gene promoter areas or by transcription factors. We performed genome-wide methyl binding domain (MBD)-sequencing (seq) and RNA-seq in perilesional, thalamic, and hippocampal tissue sampled at 3Â months after TBI induced by lateral fluid percussion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. We investigated the regulated molecular networks and mechanisms underlying the chronic regulation, particularly DNA methylation and transcription factors. Finally, we identified compounds that modulate the transcriptomics changes and could be repurposed to improve recovery. Unexpectedly, DNA methylation was not a major regulator of chronic post-TBI transcriptomics changes. On the other hand, the transcription factors Cebpd, Pax6, Spi1, and Tp73 were upregulated at 3Â months after TBI (False discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05), which was validated using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction. Transcription regulatory network analysis revealed that these transcription factors regulate apoptosis, inflammation, and microglia, which are well-known contributors to secondary damage after TBI.Â Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) analysis identified 118 pharmacotherapies that regulate the expression of Cebpd, Pax6, Spi1, and Tp73. Of these, the antidepressant and/or antipsychotic compounds trimipramine, rolipramine, fluspirilene, and chlorpromazine, as well as the anti-cancer therapies pimasertib, tamoxifen, and vorinostat were strong regulators of the identified transcription factors, suggesting their potential to modulate the regulated transcriptomics networks to improve post-TBI recovery.",2018,Biology;

25441dd28f1d3b12d11e09a7d88ba26e8e7346ea,The necessity of adjusting tests of protein category enrichment in discovery proteomics,"MOTIVATION
Enrichment tests are used in high-throughput experimentation to measure the association between gene or protein expression and membership in groups or pathways. The Fisher's exact test is commonly used. We specifically examined the associations produced by the Fisher test between protein identification by mass spectrometry discovery proteomics, and their Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments in a large yeast dataset. We found that direct application of the Fisher test is misleading in proteomics due to the bias in mass spectrometry to preferentially identify proteins based on their biochemical properties. False inference about associations can be made if this bias is not corrected. Our method adjusts Fisher tests for these biases and produces associations more directly attributable to protein expression rather than experimental bias.


RESULTS
Using logistic regression, we modeled the association between protein identification and GO term assignments while adjusting for identification bias in mass spectrometry. The model accounts for five biochemical properties of peptides: (i) hydrophobicity, (ii) molecular weight, (iii) transfer energy, (iv) beta turn frequency and (v) isoelectric point. The model was fit on 181 060 peptides from 2678 proteins identified in 24 yeast proteomics datasets with a 1% false discovery rate. In analyzing the association between protein identification and their GO term assignments, we found that 25% (134 out of 544) of Fisher tests that showed significant association (q-value â‰¤0.05) were non-significant after adjustment using our model. Simulations generating yeast protein sets enriched for identification propensity show that unadjusted enrichment tests were biased while our approach worked well.",2010,Computer Science; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Brenton Louie"", ids = ""2755525""); list(name = ""Roger Higdon"", ids = ""1735613""); list(name = ""Eugene Kolker"", ids = ""2823712"")",b4c3e0bf9fc69168aaee51e07c7d8f7249980a25; c8817d190c5addbac608b2e98d95be39b4e5093c; fef0dcc028d1b341655f0fa87cb2e47a9699d2d6; 5de879452c4dcc5b9077c87f836cea3f24d7c3a5; 265a165fda1ea4dfa16612efc5043b07ca444e55; ffb3ac4a891bdbf1494fc777754c77dd78da8ac5,a2893118e14c29a23472b02249b4641b9971786b; 303644f29d1b686b34ddc964f8a8ad4fd3a5e51d; c33642d400e3d5c7bc0562de5a3a54799993aa01; 28e2ba9b0c00ed55ae7d445844e31922e9d24ad1; 13385cdae7c02326dea524bf58f4b00a4814562e; 6625ff73b82cf8dc8f533a8b78101341c42de0df; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 6fd97064070b45a1fe6cc36c7b09c2546babcd8b; 2bb528eff6fbba44955c726479fab52e9008e7b9; 5ab7ec2c03098b192fb40d926dcf25bd0f482e11; f553e0200691837fd2101d8f5ee1ef08cc60388d; a2792d78d7bd427008232a007741d3347fdc2072; 5e0a07dbe47afc102a3024b9c5b654332b67e5b9; c299c50508e1ed9155f93867f610279b81682ad6; dea98c6314b8c49c45d26bab3f5c3e8ba7343b64; f0b25b16bdcb7b6418e284255b9e2ba32a7585d4; ffb3ac4a891bdbf1494fc777754c77dd78da8ac5; 07a85978f2ceec841299c6d2f4e79e56548affc6; 96eb86116819edf94467422c14ba4f73340f9165; 7493b467a81dbf7b4efab2c50ccb96557c12979c,Bioinformatics,26 24,"

With a spectrum-level false discovery rate of â‰¤â€‰1%, 1,336 intact N-glycopeptides from the combination of 301 unique peptide backbones and 169 putative N-glycan linkages (52 monosaccharide compositions) were identified; the corresponding intact N-glycoproteins and N-glycosites were 289 and 305, respectively, among which 176 N-glycosites were confirmed with GlcNAc-containing site-determining b/y fragment ion pairs. The N-glycan moieties in 546 intact N-glycopeptide IDs were identified with more than one structure-diagnostic fragment ions where multiple linkage structures exist for each of the monosaccharide compositions. With the criteria of â‰¥â€‰1.5-fold change and p value <â€‰0.05, 72 cell-surface differentially expressed intact N-glycopeptides (DEGPs) were found in MCF-7/ADR CSCs relative to MCF-7/ADR cells, where 8 and 64 were downregulated and upregulated, respectively.

03515348c23a92e77955a56a3ec8b75817a8e000,Testing and detecting jumps based on a discretely observed process,"We propose a new nonparametric test for detecting the presence of jumps in asset prices using discretely observed data. Compared with the test in AÃ¯t-Sahalia and Jacod (2009), our new test enjoys the same asymptotic properties but has smaller variance. These results are justified both theoretically and numerically. We also propose a new procedure to locate the jumps. The jump identification problem reduces to a multiple comparison problem. We employ the false discovery rate approach to control the probability of type I error. Numerical studies further demonstrate the power of our new method. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological knowledge about the disease over the past decade. We aimed to use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's disease.


METHODS
We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from Parkinson's disease GWAS available from European ancestry samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets incorporated all available data. We then used these data to estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian randomisation.


FINDINGS
Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018, we analysed 7Â·8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37â€ˆ688 cases, 18â€ˆ618 UK Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative that does), and 1Â·4 million controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16-36% of the heritable risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk signals underlying GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0Â·0035 for intracranial volume, p=0Â·024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0Â·024), and educational attainment (p=0Â·038). Mendelian randomisation between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk showed a robust association (p=8Â·00â€ˆÃ—â€ˆ10-7).


INTERPRETATION
These data provide the most comprehensive survey of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with more diverse data.

This study investigated the effects of WMH on gray matter (GM) volume in patients with AD. We consecutively enrolled 84 patients with AD and 35 normal controls, who underwent brain MRI and were then classified according to WMH grade, based on a combination of deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) and periventricular white matter hyperintensity (PVWMH). The volume changes in GM were observed using voxel-based morphometry. It was found that global GM volume decreased with increasing WMH. Regional atrophies were in the dorsolateral frontal lobes, orbitofrontal gyri and insula (false discovery rate [FDR], p<0.01). After controlling for PVWMH, DWMH affected cortical atrophy in the frontal lobe, insula and precuneus (FDR, p<0.05), but PVWMH did not. Thus, WMH in AD is associated with GM volume reduction, especially in the frontal lobe, and DWMH is independently related to cortical atrophy.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sam-Yeol Ha"", ids = ""5094932""); list(name = ""Young Chul Youn"", ids = ""3689672""); list(name = ""SangYun Kim"", ids = ""145725046""); list(name = ""Ging-Yuek Robin Hsiung"", ids = ""123540198""); list(name = ""Oh-Sang Kwon"", ids = ""145852839"")",4abc3a21fe42e685843ae6104767f75d2dd49168; 57ae85d7ab79e09c2b92b54f083799e32acdc363; 86ab69978824f4d278dff628588aaf49d8815325; 6bde910988fefb9693816121ffe2eaabeca373bd; 86b7b1caf4eb229de69cdbd11ac519751f2650c9; 4b3cc7a8a6095b9e11678c6fad758ea5d4499359; bd683d8e861ac6ac0742b60064c4ced898fa85a4,,Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,19,1506-1510
347f43258f84a8b331b91c01730b8fe2bdbb94f7,Linking Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes: Novel shared susceptibility genes detected by cFDR approach,"BACKGROUND
Both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) occur commonly in the aging populations and T2D has been considered as an important risk factor for AD. The heritability of both diseases is estimated to be over 50%. However, common pleiotropic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/loci have not been well-defined. The aim of this study is to analyze two large public accessible GWAS datasets to identify novel common genetic loci for T2D and/or AD.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
The recently developed novel conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) approach was used to analyze the summary GWAS datasets from International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) and Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) to identify novel susceptibility genes for AD and T2D.


RESULTS
We identified 78 SNPs (including 58 novel SNPs) that were associated with AD in Europeans conditional on T2D (cFDR<0.05). 66 T2D SNPs (including 40 novel SNPs) were identified by conditioning on SNPs association with AD (cFDR<0.05). A conjunction-cFDR (ccFDR) analysis detected 8 pleiotropic SNPs with a significance threshold of ccFDR<0.05 for both AD and T2D, of which 5 SNPs (rs6982393, rs4734295, rs7812465, rs10510109, rs2421016) were novel findings. Furthermore, among the 8 SNPs annotated at 6 different genes, 3 corresponding genes TP53INP1, TOMM40 and C8orf38 were related to mitochondrial dysfunction, critically involved in oxidative stress, which potentially contribute to the etiology of both AD and T2D.

d4c9e487a50558abee876214627a2ee2a8e8300c,"A top-down, step up approach to pharmacogenetic discovery using CEPH family cell lines","Background/Aims 
 
Previously Watters et al. (PNAS, 2004) found strong cell viability dose-response for 5-FU (0.21â€“0.70), and identified QTLs (chromosome 9: LOD=3.4) using public microsatellite data. We try to localize these toxicity genes using the HapMap published SNPs. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 
30 CEPH HapMap trio cell lines, treated with 9 different doses of 5-FU, were analyzed at 4928 SNPs in the chromosome 9 QTL region. We used various statistical methods (179 SNPs were significant at p<0.05, uncorrected), including the False Discovery Rate, Storey's Q, and Sequential Multiple Decision Procedures (SMDP). 
 
 
 
Results 
 
Five SNPs were chosen as significant signals by SMDP at a power of 95% (but requiring only 78% of the sample), with sequential R2 of 0.16, 0.16, 0.17, 0.17, 0.11 respectively. Subselecting LD tag SNPs (Lazarus et al., 2004) reduces the number by nearly half, thus improving power. We employ a step up strategy from single SNPs to LD blocks to haplotypes, and finally to gene-based associations. 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
CEPH family cell lines are a powerful, unique resource for in vitro phamacogenetic toxicity gene discovery.

486791850dbbfc10d1aa7e2e819c8f35e2e3401e,Transcriptional similarity in couples reveals the impact of shared environment and lifestyle on gene regulation through modified cytosines,"Gene expression is a complex and quantitative trait that is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic regulators including environmental factors. Evaluating the contribution of environment to gene expression regulation and identifying which genes are more likely to be influenced by environmental factors are important for understanding human complex traits. We hypothesize that by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes that may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air pollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us to characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression levels between husbands and wives. Strikingly, 778 genes were found to show much smaller variances in couples than random pairs of individuals at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Since genetic variation between unrelated family members in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a random-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more likely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in couples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those genes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the relationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Our findings suggested that transcriptional similarity in couples likely reflected shared common environment partially mediated through cytosine modifications.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ke Tang"", ids = ""144994539""); list(name = ""Wei Zhang"", ids = ""50549803"")",75fdac5b34a936c0cbed4cc31758d5525329398e; 78d8d8ab84392d825cffe90f43544baa1962d4a7; 998910f267bb37c1118187066b9f069d8473f70d,a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; f1bcbe5845406cf32742e8d2219498c23337f9a5; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 2e616700a64c9698ebf2cb7499b6c1f341940107; 3c87b96e9ed0442024392edb6851335278bf9c89; d4ce184d948fa019162d313c6ab8b76e6fd4e2fc; 5941c341a63965dc0da2c6cc96d4ab033abb62b8; 2dcb161f52788a944b83b2ebbf4b370b1ee19e69; c6da0847d8c0975849c3f16aa33770b4aa8a19cd; 4a5b9953d4407c22bbf8f79d87279d4ea9bf1ae6; eb538fbc151b8b4f841ab32d8925bc27f26d4201; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 84603fc0fab55a0bb55222098d26306f345f6e33; 8696b7b35fd5c0f6b83abdf94ec039d4c9c3187e; a49aee23e88764d9d7fdfddbdb2a17f61bc39789; 98ee096410d67a2fb6478b4b7ca22d67a5b1c624; dd4629889320629b9e6a069e9a68ae6c36b621aa; 059eb3da5c1849149c1405e906cfb7aba4689f0b; 18c41713e2d4c5748136ee57b071ff0eb27c0a8a; 00010bba512b315252bfce0de13ed033b293ce53,PeerJ,4,

For scanning statistics, due to local dependence, clusters of neighbouring hypotheses are likely to be rejected together. In such situations, it is more intuitive and informative to group neighbouring rejections together and count them as a single discovery, with the false discovery rate defined as the proportion of clusters that are falsely declared among all declared clusters. Assuming that the number of false discoveries, under this broader definition of a discovery, is approximately Poisson and independent of the number of true discoveries, we examine approaches for estimating and controlling the false discovery rate, and provide examples from biological applications.

fbaf41975aac7b83ab7095895f53e9e465f15dee,Bayesian hierarchical modeling for subject-level response classification in peptide microarray immunoassays.,"The peptide microarray immunoassay simultaneously screens sample serum against thousands of peptides, determining the presence of antibodies bound to array probes. Peptide microarrays tiling immunogenic regions of pathogens (e.g., envelope proteins of a virus) are an important high throughput tool for querying and mapping antibody binding. Because of the assay's many steps, from probe synthesis to incubation, peptide microarray data can be noisy with extreme outliers. In addition, subjects may produce different antibody profiles in response to an identical vaccine stimulus or infection, due to variability among subjects' immune systems. We present a robust Bayesian hierarchical model for peptide microarray experiments, pepBayes, to estimate the probability of antibody response for each subject/peptide combination. Heavy-tailed error distributions accommodate outliers and extreme responses, and tailored random effect terms automatically incorporate technical effects prevalent in the assay. We apply our model to two vaccine trial data sets to demonstrate model performance. Our approach enjoys high sensitivity and specificity when detecting vaccine induced antibody responses. A simulation study shows an adaptive thresholding classification method has appropriate false discovery rate control with high sensitivity, and receiver operating characteristics generated on vaccine trial data suggest that pepBayes clearly separates responses from non-responses.",2016,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gregory Imholte"", ids = ""5286293""); list(name = ""Raphael Gottardo"", ids = ""3118134"")",,,Biometrics,72 4,"

Improving stability of multiple testing procedures can help to increase the consistency of findings from replicated experiments. Benjamini-Hochbergâ€™s and Storeyâ€™s q-value procedures are two commonly used multiple testing procedures for controlling false discoveries in genomic studies. Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure has higher power and lower stability than Benjamini-Hochbergâ€™s procedure. To improve upon the stability of Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure and maintain its high power in genomic data analysis, we propose a new multiple testing procedure, named Bon-EV, to control false discovery rate (FDR) based on Bonferroniâ€™s approach.ResultsSimulation studies show that our proposed Bon-EV procedure can maintain the high power of the Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure and also result in better FDR control and higher stability than Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure for samples of large size(30 in each group) and medium size (15 in each group) for either independent, somewhat correlated, or highly correlated test statistics. When sample size is small (5 in each group), our proposed Bon-EV procedure has performance between the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and the Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure. Examples using RNA-Seq data show that the Bon-EV procedure has higher stability than the Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure while maintaining equivalent power, and higher power than the Benjamini-Hochbergâ€™s procedure.ConclusionsFor medium or large sample sizes, the Bon-EV procedure has improved FDR control and stability compared with the Storeyâ€™s q-value procedure and improved power compared with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

65e0a9bd92ffac1c1b17ae19babebc8234a1d35f,Cannabis Dampens the Effects of Music in Brain Regions Sensitive to Reward and Emotion,"Background
Despite the current shift towards permissive cannabis policies, few studies have investigated the pleasurable effects users seek. Here, we investigate the effects of cannabis on listening to music, a rewarding activity that frequently occurs in the context of recreational cannabis use. We additionally tested how these effects are influenced by cannabidiol, which may offset cannabis-related harms.


Methods
Across 3 sessions, 16 cannabis users inhaled cannabis with cannabidiol, cannabis without cannabidiol, and placebo. We compared their response to music relative to control excerpts of scrambled sound during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging within regions identified in a meta-analysis of music-evoked reward and emotion. All results were False Discovery Rate corrected (P<.05).


Results
Compared with placebo, cannabis without cannabidiol dampened response to music in bilateral auditory cortex (right: P=.005, left: P=.008), right hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (P=.025), right amygdala (P=.025), and right ventral striatum (P=.033). Across all sessions, the effects of music in this ventral striatal region correlated with pleasure ratings (P=.002) and increased functional connectivity with auditory cortex (right: P< .001, left: P< .001), supporting its involvement in music reward. Functional connectivity between right ventral striatum and auditory cortex was increased by cannabidiol (right: P=.003, left: P=.030), and cannabis with cannabidiol did not differ from placebo on any functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging measures. Both types of cannabis increased ratings of wanting to listen to music (P<.002) and enhanced sound perception (P<.001).


Conclusions
Cannabis dampens the effects of music in brain regions sensitive to reward and emotion.

0952b92cba1687d98c6dd1cb71e07460293be6b6,Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.,"BACKGROUND
Aberrant DNA methylation may promote prostate carcinogenesis. We investigated epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles in prostate cancer (PCa) compared to adjacent benign tissue to identify differentially methylated CpG sites.


METHODS
The study included paired PCa and adjacent benign tissue samples from 20 radical prostatectomy patients. Epigenetic profiling was done using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models that accounted for the paired study design and False Discovery Rate Q-values were used to evaluate differential CpG methylation. mRNA expression levels of the genes with the most differentially methylated CpG sites were analyzed.


RESULTS
In total, 2,040 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified in PCa versus adjacent benign tissue (Q-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.001), the majority of which were hypermethylated (nâ€‰=â€‰1,946; 95%). DNA methylation profiles accurately distinguished between PCa and benign tissue samples. Twenty-seven top-ranked hypermethylated CpGs had a mean methylation difference of at least 40% between tissue types, which included 25 CpGs in 17 genes. Furthermore, for 10 genes over 50% of promoter region CpGs were hypermethylated in PCa versus benign tissue. The top-ranked differentially methylated genes included three genes that were associated with both promoter hypermethylation and reduced gene expression: SCGB3A1, HIF3A, and AOX1. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data provided confirmatory evidence for our findings.


CONCLUSIONS
This study of PCa versus adjacent benign tissue showed many differentially methylated CpGs and regions in and outside gene promoter regions, which may potentially be used for the development of future epigenetic-based diagnostic tests or as therapeutic targets.",2015,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Milan S.

1da5ba6d8fd31dec63ab36263bcab52e592e9f49,Blind testing cross-linking/mass spectrometry under the auspices of the 11th critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP11),"Determining the structure of a protein by any method requires varies contributions from experimental and computational sides. In a recent study, high-density cross-linking/mass spectrometry data in combination with ab initio structure prediction by conformational space search determined the structure of human serum albumin (HSA) domains, with an RMSD to X-ray structure of up to 2.53 Ã…, or 3.38 Ã… in the context of blood serum. This paper reports the blind test on the readiness of this technology through the help of Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). We identified between 201-381 unique residue pairs at an estimated 5% FDR (at link level albeit with missing site assignment precision evaluation), for the four proteins that we provided data for. This equates to between 0.63-1.20 proximal residues per residue, which is comparable to that obtained in the HSA study (0.85 links per residue at 5% FDR). Nevertheless, initial results of CASP11 have suggested that improvements in structure prediction using cross-link data are slight. Most significantly, however, CASP11 revealed to us some of the current limitations of cross-linking, spelling out areas in which the method must develop in future: links spread unevenly over sequence and beta sheets both lacked links and suffered from weak definition of observed links over structure. With CASP12 taking place this year and biannually in the future, blind testing low-resolution structure analysis tools is a worthwhile and feasible undertaking.

None of these have so far been adopted in clinical practice. Objective To use a novel custom-made proteomics chip to discover new prognostic biomarkers for AF risk. Methods In two independent community-based cohorts (Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (978 participants without AF, mean age 70.1â€…years, 50% women, median follow-up 10.0â€…years) and Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) (n=725, mean age 77.5â€…years, median follow-up 7.9â€…years)), ninety-two plasma proteins were assessed at baseline by a proximity extension assay (PEA) chip. Of those, 85 proteins showed a call rate >70% in both cohorts. Results Thirteen proteins were related to incident AF in PIVUS (148 events) using a false discovery rate of 5%. Of those, five were replicated in ULSAM at nominal multivariable p value (123 events, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)). Of those, NT-pro-BNP and FGF-23 were also associated with AF after adjusting for established AF risk factors. In a prespecified secondary analysis pooling the two data sets, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) and adrenomedullin (AM) were also significantly related to incident AF in addition to the aforementioned five proteins (Bonferroni-adjustment). The addition of NT-pro-BNP to a model with established risk factors increased the C-statistic from 0.605 to 0.676 (p<0.0001). Conclusions Using a novel proteomics approach, we confirmed the previously reported association between NT-pro-BNP, FGF-23, GDF-15 and incident AF, and also discovered four proteins (FABP4, IL-6, TIM-1 and AM) that could be of importance in the development of AF.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lars Lind"", ids = ""2813823""); list(name = ""Johan SundstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""144023638""); list(name = ""Markus Stenemo"", ids = ""6188732""); list(name = ""E HagstrÃ¶m"", ids = ""144949641""); list(name = ""Johan Ã„rnlÃ¶v"", ids = ""4998047"")",60f61e1dab2e754437d19f72db7740a6def75f11; a84dc99eda486b04fff74079098fb81da0c0aefa; c7decee776f2660a89fb45323936d40725e0c7d7; 87497dd7a52e67a9a0fc3f6355ab9e733dc63dc7; 70393dfb5f5e76b8dd08f8c2c1ce1f0c97da9866; 1c29ad361dc00fa407fc6ecc267791208f964bb2; faeeaebdd8c9ce6cb9f11a1d01dffffa07217592; 2b85818945ea360c8c3b75dbf4b829cac8f54c5c; fb3fd4182d93bd518ad0edad18e23dad4500f56a; deda0a856ca2035d96c7c69c1c10afe1e3122aba; 2da3e5c8d8979122599a6201c02574242c15b0a1; e334fb6e8d146e2497c21012ff9ad7d113c04ef7; ac717ca472b7596b875dd52f3d68658784a2f6f2; 65f05ede4f6947c70f48dfbb039e218982f4f4a1; 6fcebe3abdec3f973d662fb2fb0abbe2055b653a; 611db055388f0a217c7064867b5ea7ef3f43306e; e9bb10690cf9db03f76e9e03104c78005a674398; 8901895ae0aa5ffc492c6ab07dd15956199db591,4de3d65bc962aac513b7d3ea251af2431049454c; b19d1d870ad4e11ba5ea2056b71ae154fab29821; 919d119b25eb1534206c3b687101eac2a62f3849; 4cc4eaa993baf31bf5b1720158a6f6c1dd13d4ea; b27d633c11c963d61e294589c21ce2e32674406c; cb6542be8fdbc3ecb6a28954a0807275b23a3aa0; 028d7655f29d788c70872d42e9d6346e97ece05d; 0c2f5aa96377a3ad37e5a36e607d2257d2a3e831; 445e2cbbe4eec55d8c2aa8bee9d6bb5a2469d3f1; d902e896019a96efc05ae57f2cce12aeb160559f; 5d292a99e49438e5372bb4ea6a0ce83143ada0ba; 83de90d9e83e057e3490e27059aea4cd2b8b78eb; 3c107f8e332724ded01f637921401e6672d36ff0; d2797b619c9dcedd349ddb750fea19431aa9c388; 600b15255225012b420526c06aab742fa86347c1; 1d54d27682f84839ae581e513bf1be53523b7e71; faf23ebe4ff3e723ad5ee2950ec61c15f51344fc; 0151a3970274fd2bad19f17041f93fae56ed76ad; c5073f5226fc5ad06f5e2b7eba60e5c2e21b30ce; 24c92e1dce70b3f91bf4d0b32564005c20ef7a98; 18c434c04e4d4a9107bccf2bd7a652185f7a8504; 22826c9353fd0f6d5a096ccc77cadf16998de431; 7a456adc8bdd5828919efc561ff81e661eee1fcf; e3a03444b2c8a75de11f89705edc37f203f699fa; 0c1a1e6a268773ffcde0e00d8858cfa16c72a731; 7e2d9fd1fe388e8c90d82de835018f5f6e18fcd1; d02ab0904b0b5dd9c7ec1ba9632033b6bd0a6647; 72fe82b1dddb81fb9b041382e77d192b3163ef44; c461741ed1ea65500138c1ac8ba1d6444e767b04,Heart,103,377â€“382
15c790cfa8afff058ce02b342ebe20ee7c045750,Dependency and false discovery rate: Asymptotics,"Some effort has been undertaken over the last decade to provide conditions for the control of the false discovery rate by the linear step-up procedure (LSU) for testing n hypotheses when test statistics are dependent. In this paper we investigate the expected error rate (EER) and the false discovery rate (FDR) in some extreme parameter configurations when n tends to infinity for test statistics being exchangeable under null hypotheses. All results are derived in terms of p-values. In a general setup we present a series of results concerning the interrelation of Simes' rejection curve and the (limiting) empirical distribution function of the p-values. Main objects under investigation are largest (limiting) crossing points between these functions, which play a key role in deriving explicit formulas for EER and FDR. As specific examples we investigate equi-correlated normal and t-variables in more detail and compute the limiting EER and FDR theoretically and numerically. A surprising limit behavior occurs if these models tend to independence.",2007,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Helmut Finner"", ids = ""2839900""); list(name = ""Thorsten Dickhaus"", ids = ""46649155""); list(name = ""Markus Roters"", ids = ""89287908"")",2d9c75dbcd4b7d9fc6f82583521342ea63fbf925; 7c879ee6818f5165da33ae7719f3c7ef1bde99d5; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 8396fc79b650405e2222532b76d38f3b4745c8a5; 15b4192d8024b0ef6db4d82ae131289e6e36b701; f894480feb384ec064962637bbcba1a3b45716ab; c7980dbe0470e041ed17da22250f15fb35f3e73d; 92013517811f387db2d75b6f81a524813c760218; d0686c1edd5b143758a6e567d929eb00fda4eb3c; 858ebcba255653003d19f6a1b2a6935e9ec78c3d; 99db27561736a2db4618a9e586d0d12da856e80a; 9c749dfc75a76e7aedca212f333d76b7a9e7f8ad; e6fbec5d97a9b9ec3b04f72079387352752cbab5; 47d1f32aa0e760d570fdd57a95280f0618f1003a; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 67649d23be4d917569d7d0e308ba5f5bf7f6af37; 88f69717144de10a438b5ef3d7f925025d11ed0e; f41bb337b14793bfe08752ca6d49c3345c520a47; 6a17464d5452d257cba944342e067b49228bdaaa; 1c49766cd3d2e19089fea703e579a73011946ac7; 0ac8035938e2077d300b5ca64f7303df2d2e54fd; 78b448b1096faa0815944f10cdf034433e90f0b3; 915f0d6d125c289ac5f76dba9ee8fdba90eaa6c9; 5f979b16d652f594af251c830cb0436aa5814a22; 86f7e3884dc7c5921ead7c9531851595bdc98cd0; cedda598732ea3c959cc5bc6a596c1b303c5c54b; 1629449886d68f1c020446d3cb9c3e94f3abd6b5; e3159d253d3dc7497604a54f1a907afddbae2fee; 9b7944d85138c4b6a31f667a6f1c585b8e97cf7c; 9457054dd267bbeb15d0d859b04e4b36171ea5b6; 297729649e7cc13fb54880ac4cf49ef89dfd72a7; 37f6545085e7dcddf483728d17113013a86a3165; 19b0c1c501abcf09e396602da00217964b407afc; 1e0658277dc6c7c89138dc2f7dd50c9bfee0c617; dfff8d51748c865d2af104a8d803039d1510554d; d385eadf84bc1ec6233d6ebe867c3b5f15681622; 707f0429acd8df60ae752e078fc53733b01776bf; 2c4c300672ea8634f4714432cbd54d9f3f9d37b4; 5422a2a99870e82ba91ebfb26e8b6ed2227470bc; 37f0cf003b755c69677ee1b7fe13e2343a91cc3b; f2adeb3000c8460593f585f4bb9cf0b9f5bba30e; 6d05318d6ac2b5b902adf7db160de523d5902430; 0fd87a2d4fe652194e36f53c080e14f71bf1ffdd; bc7a85db397394ef6899ddeaa0eaa7a4eb0e6ebb; 3264f21e5757d26cc75e2a4ff523747732dfd843; 275a6c6ee2badd48096441e3174f9ed86926dee7; 5460eabd6725135c8d77d3f973168bf68e879fb5,013a6103f789a70b629e82a0ea65a11f6424aa17; fd781e8eaecafad94290f53a9dba0c64efb3b6ce; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 4286db547a55ec49c57f5213c75937de240ebc95; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; e0602c5359e059d9395eda68cf5b15cd3df3206d; 4364047c07ab9d7f0f77ee68090e7deea6956d53; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 7ccdb4cad5622783e44a3a70f5ee88cf067cefd4; 967d6d6528cf296eda4f28116053ccbad114a735; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3,Annals of Statistics,35,1432-1455
e655c56e9b1e722b926f0fc4a7ff5dbc77e6ddcc,Gene Expression Profiling of IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (IgM-MGUS),"The 2nd IWWM tried to define reproducible criteria for the diagnosis of IgM-MGUS and Waldenstrom9s Macroglobulinemia. IgM-MGUS was defined as asymptomatic condition characterized by serum IgM monoclonal protein (MC) without morphologic evidence of bone marrow (BM) lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. The proposal of the guidelines was to classify as MGUS also patients with equivocal evidence of BM infiltration, such as those presenting clonal B-cells by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in the absence of morphologic evidence of BM infiltration, as well as those with equivocal BM infiltrates not confirmed by immunophenotypic studies. Patients The diagnosis of IgM-MGUS was made in 11 patients (6 males, 5 females) according to the consensus panel criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 73 (range, 60-77). Ten patients had K light chains. The median erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11. The MC level at diagnosis ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 g/dL (median 0.4). Only one patient had MC value > 1.0 g/dL. The median IgM value was 697 mg/dL (range 116-1790). Five of 11 IgM-MGUS patients showed a small clonal B-cell population (light-chain-isotype-positive B-cells) detected by MFC without histologic evidence of BM infiltration. Therefore, patients were divided in 2 groups: group 1 (n=5) showing a clonal B-cell population, and group 2 (n=6) with polyclonal B-cells at MFC. Methods and results We isolated BM CD19+ cells in the 11 IgM-MGUS patients using Miltenyi Microbeads and performed microarray with Affymetrix-HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed and different sets of genes were defined based on REACTOME pathways, KEGG pathways and GO Biological Process Terms. Interestingly, 17 top-ranking gene sets including differently expressed genes, reached a nominal p-value lower than 0.001; 2 gene sets were upregulated (while 15 gene sets were downregulated in monoclonal vs. polyclonal IgM-MGUS (table 1). No genes resulted significantly differentially expressed between group 1 and group 2 using a classic SAM test for microarrays and correcting for multiple testing with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%. Similarly, IgM and MC were not differentially expressed between the two groups, although IgM showed a nominal p-value of 0.09 (t-test). However, when using linear regression to explain each gene expression data as a function of both IgM and MC, UBTF, TRIM5, FLJ35816, RDH10 genes were selected based on a FDR equal to 5%, applied to the F-statistic p-value. In particular, the model fitting UBTF had a p-value of 9.461e-07 and an adjusted R-squared of 0.9786; table 2 displays the coefficients of the model and the related p-values, showing a positive co-regulation of UBTF with MC. Conclusions In conclusion, microarray of IgM-MGUS gives insights into gene expression differences in IgM-MGUS. Notably, UBTF is a transcription factor which plays a crucial role in the transcription of rRNA in ERK-pathway, suggesting a possible role of ERK-pathway in IgM-MGUS. Additional gene expression measurements are ongoing in a larger cohort of IgM-MGUS patients.

c33bb00b5eac23b8b5865b6d4d94b32f4de59917,Proteomic analysis of tear fluid reveals disease-specific patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease - A pilot study.,"BACKGROUND
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still challenging and biomarkers could contribute to an improved diagnostic accuracy. Tear fluid (TF) is an easily accessible body fluid reflecting pathophysiological changes in systemic and ocular diseases and is already used as a biomarker source for several ophthalmological disorders. Here, we analyzed the TF of patients with PD and controls (CTR) to describe disease-related changes in TF and identify putative biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD.


METHODS
Unstimulated TF samples of a pilot cohort with 36 PD patients and 18 CTR were collected via Schirmer tear test strips and then analyzed via a Bottom-up liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (BULCMS) workflow, followed by functional analysis encompassing protein-protein interaction as well as cellular component and pathway analysis.


RESULTS
BULCMS analysis lead to the identification of 571 tear proteins (false discovery rate, FDRâ€¯<â€¯1%), whereby 31 proteins were exclusively detected in the PD group and 7 only in the CTR group. Whereas 21 proteins were significantly increased in the PD versus CTR groups, 19 proteins were significantly decreased. Core networks of proteins involved in immune response, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress were distinctly altered in PD patients.


CONCLUSIONS
To our best knowledge, this is the first description of TF proteome in PD patients. Tear protein level alterations suggest the contribution of different disease-related mechanisms in ocular pathology in PD and propose candidate proteins to be validated as potential biomarkers in larger cohorts.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthias Boerger"", ids = ""47857204""); list(name = ""Sebastian Funke"", ids = ""1991540""); list(name = ""Andreas Leha"", ids = ""50002262""); list(name = ""Anna-Elisa Roser"", ids = ""3663756""); list(name = ""Ann-Katrin Wuestemann"", ids = ""83313502""); list(name = ""Fabian Maass"", ids = ""40330287""); list(name = ""Mathias BÃ¤hr"", ids = ""2144488""); list(name = ""Franz H.

Method:We included 24 adults with MTLE without depression (17 women, 38.7 mean age), 24 adults with MTLE with depression (13 women, 39.6 mean age), and 96 healthy controls (75 women, 35.1 mean age). All MTLE patients were diagnosed by clinical, eletro and image features. Depression was diagnosed by a structured clinical interview (SCID I) and its sympomatology was checked by the Beck Depression Inventory. All patients underwent highresolution MRI scan. We performed VBM analysis on SPM5 and MATLAB7, comparing groups of patients with control group. The statistical analysis for all comparisons was performed with grand mean scaling, proportional threshold masking and implicit masking. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 5%. We also investigated the regional correlation between GMV in MTLE with depression, checking their performance on the BDI. This form of VBM was performed on the whole brain, using the general linear model protocols built into SPM5. Results: Half of the patients with MTLE also had depression. There wasno significative difference in termsof sex (p=0.371), epilepsyonset (p=0.495), epilepsy duration (p=0.129) and frequency of seizures (p=0.285) in thegroups ofMTLEwithorwithout depression.We found no significant difference between groups when the group of MTLE with depression was divided in right and left MTLE with depression (p=0.147). Besides the fact that the laterality was not a significant factor for depression in MTLE, the group of left MTLE with depression had a more severe depression than the group of right MTLE with depression (p=0.014). Therewasno regional correlation betweenGMV in MTLE with depression and their performance on the BDI. Patients with MTLE with depression had more areas of reduced volume. Conclusions: The neuropathologic changes of MTLE seem to be magnified in the presence of a chronic untreated depression disorder. The evidence of GMV loss in patients with MTLE with depression calls our attention to the importance of timely recognition and treatment of depression in patients with MTLE and also to the bidirectional relation between the two disorders and their frequent comorbid occurrence.",2012,Psychology,"list(name = ""Priscila Camilo Barione Salgado"", ids = ""114707332""); list(name = ""Clarissa Lin Yasuda"", ids = ""51162341""); list(name = ""Fernando Cendes"", ids = ""144366417"")",,,Epilepsy & Behavior,24,

In this talk, I will present a unified approach to measure reproducibility of findings identified from replicate experiments and select discoveries using reproducibility between replicates. Unlike the usual scalar measures of reproducibility, our approach views reproducibility as when the findings are no longer consistent across replicates. To measure the pairwise consistency between replicates, we develop a graphical statistic based on empirical copulas and a copula mixture model to quantitatively describe the change of consistency in the decreasing significance of findings. Based on the copula mixture procedure, we define a quantity, called â€irreproducible discovery rateâ€, in a fashion analogous to the false discovery rate. This quantity, which describes the lack of reproducibility for the identifications selected at each threshold, provides a reproducibility criterion for selecting reliable signals and assessing the overall reproducibility of findings. Our approach can be applied to both probabilisticand heuristic-based significance scores, and permits principled setting of selection thresholds. This method has been adopted by ENCODE consortium for selecting ChIP-seq signal identification algorithms and monitoring the performance of their experimental facility. I will illustrate the effectiveness of our method using some ENCODE examples.",2011,,"list(name = ""Qunhua Li"", ids = ""1911733"")",,,,,
b615ed827b3f470de18f7767fc5fd69837426be0,Pathway analysis for a genome-wide association study of pneumoconiosis.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this investigation was to identify pathways involved in pneumoconiosis susceptibility, clarify their potential mechanisms, and generate SNP-to-gene to pathway hypotheses using an analytical pathway-based approach.


METHODS
The identify candidate causal SNPs and pathways (ICSNPathway) was used to perform pathway analysis of a GWAS dataset for pneumoconiosis, which, after quality control filtering, harbored genotypes of 710,999 SNPs in 202 pneumoconiosis cases and 198 exposed controls. The first stage involved the pre-selection of candidate SNPs by linkage disequilibrium analysis and functional annotation of the most significant SNPs; the second stage involved annotation of biological mechanisms for the selected candidate SNPs using improved-gene set enrichment analysis.


RESULTS
ICSNPathway analysis identified 18 candidate SNPs, involving 13 genes and 30 candidate pathways and revealed 13 hypothetical biological mechanisms. The strongest hypothetical biological mechanism was that rs8120 and rs2292151 alters the role of TICAM1, a gene involved in various pathways and processes, including positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, innate immune response-activating signal transduction, positive regulation of the innate immune response, and the biosynthesis of type I interferon (0.001<p<0.008; 0.001< false discovery rate (FDR) <0.035). The second strongest mechanism was that rs2230656 modulates HIST3H3 to affect its role in chromatin assembly processes (p<0.001; FDR <0.001). The third mechanism was that rs11592462 modulates CDH23, which regulates organization of the inner ear stereocilia, auditory receptor cell morphogenesis, ear morphogenesis, and cellular homeostasis (0.001<p<0.006; 0.001<FDR<0.044). Of 13 candidate genes, TICAM1, HIST3H3, CA1, CA3, PTPRZ1, and IL27RA are associated with fibrosis. Some of the 30 candidate pathways, which include positive regulation of TNF production, innate immune response-activating signal transduction, and regulation of innate immune response, may be associated with susceptibility to pneumoconiosis. Other candidate genes and pathways were novel or lacking fibrosis-related research.


CONCLUSION
By applying ICSNPathway analysis to the pneumoconiosis GWAS data, we identified candidate SNPs, genes such as TICAM1 and HIST3H3, and pathways involved in the positive regulation of TNF production that may contribute to pneumoconiosis susceptibility. Further analyses are needed to validate the results.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ting Wang"", ids = ""1749687""); list(name = ""Jingjin Yang"", ids = ""6684326""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Ji"", ids = ""2264680""); list(name = ""Minjie Chu"", ids = ""1994775""); list(name = ""Ruyang Zhang"", ids = ""7265522""); list(name = ""Juncheng Dai"", ids = ""144520573""); list(name = ""Guangfu Jin"", ids = ""6385852""); list(name = ""Zhibin Hu"", ids = ""143882407""); list(name = ""Hongbing Shen"", ids = ""144355454""); list(name = ""Chunhui Ni"", ids = ""39387139"")",2d602a7e20c1b88a3049cdb3344b02903727a6aa; ea36bf08b281e83df2ebca8894a565b9c1ad6761; 3d66919d4411eb44424da06fc7ad35db8f94c63d; 207b017c0471160aff3ee2c7f26b601c20ff8a05; 668438404db97695dbeef3970fcef644c787049b,5aa273d1db8662b5594ff2dcaeee279187f636b9; 6480039b32988cf83bde873263b09897e14d551e; 347b821bc86e1fdc44799dece5c6642d761f1101; 2f11dc1a3599af020591f7721133edee818c80a9; b29690de828214f7d76abafdf6dc601b07bd5899; 261597fa0a6811d94c239c683e9f9c70140f1468; 318be6b79838f9ee74a314fc44194c9568fe3a6f; ffa133d6981dfb49f8b5ad7e8904e39ea4a169c7; 7e9e9bfcace51958e580a70215110eab5dd5858a; 5c3d521a8522f12d17ffb7e8031a713d18843f00; bf453ea05b5613564c2985a60488ac96598f430c; 84e39d60745ebcf2dbc8c6f1a0695b7f30abac01; c451643b45a2c29a4e4a81744e397768379d6651; 92e3c91434f48b8856ad66235383b082277e8740; 284c82854d3ed182f7cf2614a106944a9e8ef86e; d790b77c5f9c46755c55622c67939dcfd6781f57; 84c1bdbf49db09a06c9fb357ef42a186f0f03f7d; ec79c9d3271e5b7481f1593a53b74b5452b51777; 6d623e92030a13dbd87ad6e99dc83b1e773f4320; 4c294834130d1a4bd7cc5a37543b5862faad2693; bd61f9ac0f9fb47c427aab2743e110127fdc0165; 254eba7467e9da33e95c644ee9190c8fab0ad789; cb62717b8407b27bcf67a591640715c540f1ad16; 143a4d1348def50c03d904494f46235ff0f7f220; df4a3ffb18642384a0aca0f97f52b91ac3453af6; 87581c21a7d2763eacc20d4dfd5be5e41d976682; 67e492275ff389657ab9fdb491a6c1e157521f24; 404f03060e7d55e1c8e46a36e908dc5bfcefd4da; 0f0c1834d4565b52e8c7a32a4b825da0ab2c359e; 942f9be51d640cea1ffc1aa638722a4f765ca5a6; c45ee2e0b9dc6bbf72fd9a390445eb645be959de; f211062d9624bd8e5df48f8db7dbb3f9cfabee90; 4d456666b34cc97588d8eb1a9ece1d7b0002a7a0; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; 864ca71c71c539ea68af3ab004e9ca00b6320fa6; b792a38f51d37f625f24a72358c88508fd5ab23a; de35aa1c5f6724d393d8b9c87ac9d6ea84568e3b; 3cb1e33074b47139121e12a841c0b4736454c183; 8145dee1eb7a0a0a09d65ef59b028034fc62cde1; b6d820cc886fd047f81cbb66f4419e375834a6eb; 27d57f0c4e0d6bb9c39de107e12a9d4c977cec3c; a832dff086fb8e6e15380cdb17e9f1ae77696890; cb59554e76f45f344bc60b97a6144dbb4cb0de05; e0a25102375c92dda135f82ee960322beded033a; 0ef788c47727f926a384e08cd2f95f2b3e356427; 6e21bee287b3f1bf86e7e6218611a6b6d49670b4; 9262705fa16be98d2066e8470d9590057677ff83; cc0ea67ed398312d579c64d4ba8ede659a335fd2; 7caa32f20217555939976b1a27d4fb78b1f01890; a2df67e270a8263712f39d74939123e5991326ba,Toxicology letters,232 1,"

1c09afaa4bdc00a66643c3d16504dec85474cde0,Control of generalized error rates in multiple testing,"Consider the problem of testing s hypotheses simultaneously. The usual approach restricts attention to procedures that control the probability of even one false rejection, the familywise error rate (FWER). If s is large, one might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection, thereby increasing the ability of the procedure to correctly reject false null hypotheses. One possibility is to replace control of the FWER by control of the probability of k or more false rejections, which is called the k-FWER. We derive both single-step and step-down procedures that control the k-FWER in finite samples or asymptotically, depending on the situation. We also consider the false discovery proportion (FDP) defined as the number of false rejections divided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be 0 if there are no rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289-300] controls E(FDP). Here, the goal is to construct methods which satisfy, for a given y and a, P{FDP >y} â‰¤ a, at least asymptotically. In contrast to the proposals of Lehmann and Romano [Ann. Statist. 33 (2005) 1138-1154], we construct methods that implicitly take into account the dependence structure of the individual test statistics in order to further increase the ability to detect false null hypotheses. This feature is also shared by related work of van der Laan, Dudoit and Pollard [Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 3 (2004) article 15], but our methodology is quite different. Like the work of Pollard and van der Laan [Proc. 2003 International Multi-Conference in Computer Science and Engineering, METMBS'03 Conference (2003) 3-9] and Dudoit, van der Laan and Pollard [Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 3 (2004) article 13], we employ resampling methods to achieve our goals. Some simulations compare finite sample performance to currently available methods.",2005,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Joseph P.

7499d52dba857879ae4f6a3c5ab1d6c6a6ea04c5,Association mapping in plants,"Association genetics is a relatively new approach to dissect complex traits that is based on the establishment of causal relationships between genotypes and phenotypes in natural or breeding populations. The use of new high-throughput techniques, which allow in a single assay genotyping of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), has boosted the application of this approach both in animal and plant research. Originating in human genetics, association genetics is now widely used in plant breeding, in particular in undomesticated organisms such as forest trees. The main advantage of association mapping in comparison with other common approaches (e.g. QTL mapping) is that the multiple generations of recombination that have taken place in natural populations result in a tight linkage of causal polymorphisms with nearby genomic regions, avoiding the large blocks of linkage that are often obtained from two- or three-generation pedigrees and facilitating the identification of polymorphisms that are associated with quantitative traits. 
 
Association mapping in plants is a timely, well-planned book that covers most topics related to association mapping in plants, from introductory aspects about linkage disequilibrium and SNP genotyping techniques, to sampling and data analysis issues, as well as giving insights into the potential impact of association mapping in plant breeding programmes. The book is structured into 11 chapters and four sections. Section 1 (chapters 1 and 2, 39 pp.) introduces the basic principles of association mapping, including an exhaustive literature review; Section 2 (chapters 3â€“6, 62 pp.) provides technical details on SNP genotyping, describing classical methods and new technologies (such as the 454 technology); Section 3 (chapters 7 and 8, 94 pp.), in our opinion the most remarkable part of the book, is devoted to detailed discussion of sampling strategies and statistical methodologies for the development of association mapping studies; finally, Section 4 (chapters 9â€“11, 73 pp.) consists of three chapters dealing with the application of association mapping to breeding of forage species, forest trees and perennial horticultural crops, respectively. 
 
Despite some irregularity in the quality of content and some redundancy in the most general chapters, both difficult to avoid in collective books such as this one, Association mapping in plants is an excellent overview of this fast-advancing discipline that can be used both as an introductory book for students and as a manual to design experiments and analyse genetic association data by experienced researchers or breeding program managers. Indeed, one of the merits of this book is the combination of general literature-review chapters with chapters providing detailed statistical developments and insights into the usefulness of association genetics in operative breeding. Statistical issues are presented in a relatively accessible way, accompanied by informative tables and figures, although a background on quantitative genetics would be helpful to the reader. The authors also provide several case studies and examples, reanalyses of published data and, most interesting of all, R and BUGS codes that can be used as presented or adapted to the readers' needs. The statistical part of the book covers the main approaches used in plant association genetics: case-control studies, general (GLMs) and mixed (MLMs) linear models and transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs), with a focus also on the application of Bayesian methods. Although the case for the use of Bayesian methods presented in the book is convincing, we miss a more thorough treatment of GLMs and MLMs, as these methods are nowadays one of the most common ways of analysing association genetic data for complex quantitative traits. 
 
Some other merits of this book are: (1) the insights on sampling issues, in particular the very useful discussion on the power to detect association and optimal sample size of association populations taking into account Bayes factors and genetic control of traits; (2) the treatment of common flaws in association studies, including the provision of alternatives such as STRAT to deal with the common issue of population structure; and (3) the specific discussion of methods to confront multiple-testing issues, in particular the false discovery rate (FDR) and related methods. 
 
The three last chapters of the book are well worth a comment. In them, the authors give a well-balanced view of the future of genetic association in plant breeding. For example, the chapter about forest trees begins with an exhaustive literature review and evaluation of progress in applied forest genomics and quantitative genetics in forest trees. Then, the advantages of gene-based selection (GAS) based on association genetics with respect to traditional marker-assisted selection (MAS) are discussed. The chapter continues with reporting requirements and conditions for integrating association genetics within operational forest tree breeding and finishes with a list of sensible conclusions on applicability, limitations and challenges. The information contained in these three final chapters give the reader the knowledge and tools needed to assess from a costâ€“risk perspective the use of association genetics in specific plant breeding programs. 
 
Association genetics has a broad, multidisciplinary scope and can be used not only in plant breeding (i.e. with focus on commercially interesting genes and traits) but also to advance knowledge in disciplines such as evolutionary biology or population genetics that aim at understanding evolutionary processes in nature. Association genetics, from this point of view, can provide insights into the molecular basis of adaptive traits and on the role of natural selection and other evolutionary forces in shaping genetic variation patterns in plants.

The increased disparity between organ supply and need has led to the use of extended criteria donors and donation after cardiac death donors with other comorbidities.


METHODS
We have examined the preimplantation transcriptome of 112 kidney transplant recipient samples from 100 deceased-donor kidneys by microarray profiling. Subject groups were segregated based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1 month after transplantation: the GFR-high group (n=74) included patients with eGFR 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), whereas the GFR-low group (n=35) included patients with eGFR 45 mL/min or less per 1.73 m(2).


RESULTS
Gene expression profiling identified higher expression of 160 probe sets (140 genes) in the GFR-low group, whereas expression of 37 probe sets (33 genes) was higher in the GFR-high group (P<0.01, false discovery rate <0.2). Four genes (CCL5, CXCR4, ITGB2, and EGF) were selected based on fold change and P value and further validated using an independent set of samples. A random forest analysis identified three of these genes (CCL5, CXCR4, and ITGB2) as important predictors of graft function after transplantation.


CONCLUSIONS
Inclusion of pretransplantation molecular gene expression profiles in donor quality assessment systems may provide the necessary information for better donor organ selection and function prediction. These biomarkers would further allow a more objective and complete assessment of procured renal allografts at pretransplantation time.",2012,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mariano J.

c7c14897993cfe01745fb7934236a657e87ce7e3,A Circulating miRNA Signature for Stratification of Breast Lesions among Women with Abnormal Screening Mammograms,"Although mammography is the gold standard for breast cancer screening, the high rates of false-positive mammograms remain a concern. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for a non-invasive and reliable test to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions in order to avoid subjecting patients with abnormal mammograms to unnecessary follow-up diagnostic procedures. Serum samples from 116 malignant breast lesions and 64 benign breast lesions were comprehensively profiled for 2,083 microRNAs (miRNAs) using next-generation sequencing. Of the 180 samples profiled, three outliers were removed based on the principal component analysis (PCA), and the remaining samples were divided into training (n = 125) and test (n = 52) sets at a 70:30 ratio for further analysis. In the training set, significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (adjusted p < 0.01) were identified after correcting for multiple testing using a false discovery rate. Subsequently, a predictive classification model using an eight-miRNA signature and a Bayesian logistic regression algorithm was developed. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the test set, the model could achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9542. Together, this study demonstrates the potential use of circulating miRNAs as an adjunct test to stratify breast lesions in patients with abnormal screening mammograms.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sau Yeen Loke"", ids = ""22227778""); list(name = ""Prabhakaran Munusamy"", ids = ""50038852""); list(name = ""Geok Ling Koh"", ids = ""22221826""); list(name = ""Claire Hian Tzer Chan"", ids = ""22256200""); list(name = ""Preetha Madhukumar"", ids = ""4425294""); list(name = ""Jee Liang Thung"", ids = ""108231032""); list(name = ""Kiat Tee Benita Tan"", ids = ""31945275""); list(name = ""Kong Wee Ong"", ids = ""152274945""); list(name = ""Wei Sean Yong"", ids = ""48092991""); list(name = ""Yirong Sim"", ids = ""36541357""); list(name = ""Chung Lie Oey"", ids = ""15146573""); list(name = ""Sue Zann Lim"", ids = ""50149614""); list(name = ""Mun Yew Patrick Chan"", ids = ""38757034""); list(name = ""Teng Swan Juliana Ho"", ids = ""1431722696""); list(name = ""Boon Kheng James Khoo"", ids = ""1431740945""); list(name = ""Su Lin Jill Wong"", ids = ""11478166""); list(name = ""Choon Hua Thng"", ids = ""36710742""); list(name = ""Bee Kiang Chong"", ids = ""143660303""); list(name = ""Ern Yu Tan"", ids = ""5347901""); list(name = ""Veronique Kiak-Mien Tan"", ids = ""47128965""); list(name = ""Ann Sg Lee"", ids = ""123872597"")",,dff6cac226ae128ee110b5c1977560452cc8abb9; 87f285f0d530a356e894b308944a782f417381ca; 0e5e606fa6fc6e61582c362427ca4ff13997c90b; 5e6a8d251e90f278f43901a92e8f2252abc87f2c; ca4284ba9ab64e1fd80b28346f6ebdaf225fef68; 805c6b2aaad0ae3c6574df70b86ec9534f7f64e5; ae930cb0420190992d2f360c836c2a7b6fd830e4; e4fb62edb894b5c6b06389c62794c26efa8af72c; f6200fd76e7fed877f3d2a6e89ec969145413bca; b5214c764fa492ea25e8bf2b3ab38ec1da1e3c6e; 21c1f02acff71af0f581465b8f9ced099fe707b0; 0bbf5b736384c80dfd5fbf2c6498e09b534edafc; d1feae7facfa1bdcb981ed0803bed35a3a9fd40b; 817fc8de25f989b8229847fc7710750f273460b6; 6c21317253c580df8c8f2951ee847c0e695d9de4; e04d71edb1b9644d51c6ecf07927a6eaabd30a45; 51841c8c444917b8187939cabcd98fdbb6be7db1; a39eb38805bce458ab1ccb7d2d9fff6ad8f6e1b9; 2a19d7e6880b33de75b2fcc7b97d1da7a505f492; 5c4e7227c04fb8de6fc7fbf395db536c44bb8d1d; 739315dc1368d18d43ac09932659506f5c94300b; 376994d8c4a443265afdbfc51900943b08949512; 49cad5cc0b995dd6161e6f12fb82e6e320b210a9; 752be3511a740311a1ac26b74dd14516cbede585; 6027674ecb9ac95be5d92e59e0a1a33263eda27e; da666d8eff26d82c61219e3941a2c160afc5694c; b284db7a3fda33e0be0a895fac57d2eaf9a9b26b; 9b97401527af0ebcf23b11bf57094c49553101de; 0bc8081620bac36bfcf1016823262b1cb67cdb25; 3e039975c9f5e099472281219a08c76b4e7dbe76; b0cfe8f5e0af548533e71e9d9f42cc7b5e859566; d82acf4319349a578a9eef6a9cd0fea442865dbb; 394b1cf885dba0894dc4237ce82e7d4d6af9a8c9; afb2182d4195938e51a7d3ba41dd25462fb1a569; fc6be4cc914cc7c94c4ebe54756462f163fba44e; fab930c8e83183a23e11300c21b5b1d952994ccd; 302816c4913eb3fc665afd82f4735a4d814277a1; 09cffdae73ef9e5a000ab479190494e9c9d1267a; 2f3af3205af38c201fcee1fd643999b642cc9963; 05ed4adda5abfa5a2d090d6df4e8f7e482b7b0c0; 5f3e167d5c09d499343b7407ece135e141cc26d7; 7655ba6b4cfae92f18fe9d7ffcd86a2894cd9e31; 54d7eb8360db08a8be9476facfe602dc98dd9c53; 24d1fdc3b2be0536ab216f9271c3b7e35908c7f2; a1b5d1167ebd62931abdabdfacb3c9eda740a215; c25f12c2106cb0ed9fe3dec82ca5d76026610ad6; 23c409b68c81a1470cc4fbfd9f174ff795e48f45; c82dc73a5cf51613806e9c458f460c050ebbaecc; b3debd2146083f657b3a8fc2e7f4b41a329b7100; 99d1ecc015d1778faa39e9003998cc83682457d5; a67cc4772ca0e34ede7cb3759f5c3b9b793bd2b9; e330e339203e172fcddef91336739b01c42aa8b6; 316c496768a6030d11ca9b446d4b6a305284479f; f734ca522523eb0253936341bf4f4a1105d896df; addc9b81fda258af9863f73a8f5f3c7d6d415bc6; 6ab8d8ffcad117510e2f4060aee724ea2839cdff; 2e087c3dcda94b642f9c8908c4d628cac9299df1,Cancers,11,

EBV DNAemia is a major risk factor for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder; however, immune correlates of EBV DNAemia in the transplant setting are limited.


METHODS
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 30 transplant recipients with self-limiting (SLD;n=11) or chronic EBV DNAemia (CD;n=19) at enrollment and 4-8 weeks later. Mass cytometry was used to characterize innate and T-cell immune correlates of EBV DNAemia. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to measure the frequency of EBV-specific T-cell responses between groups following stimulation with an EBV-infected cell lysate.


RESULTS
Unsupervised analysis of the innate compartment (CD3CD19 cells) identified 5 CD11c clusters at higher abundance in the SLD group (false discovery rate (FDR)â‰¤ 1%). These clusters expressed CD11b, CD45RO, CD14, CD123, CD127 and CD38, among others. Unsupervised profiling of the T-cell compartment (CD3CD19) revealed 2 CD4 T-cell clusters at higher frequency among those with SLD (FDR â‰¤ 1%), which expressed CD45RA, CCR7, CD27, CD28 and CD40L - suggestive of a naÃ¯ve T-cell (TN). Manual biaxial gating confirmed increased frequencies of conventional dendritic cells (3.1% vs. 2.1%, p=0.023) and CD4 TN (4.4% vs. 1.9%, p=0.018) among those with SLD. Lastly, frequencies of interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³)-producing EBV-specific CD4 T-cells were significantly lower in the CD group relative to those with SLD (4243 vs. 250 cells/10 cells, p=0.015).


CONCLUSIONS
Chronic EBV DNAemia is associated with a reduction of CD11c cells, CD4 TN and IFNÎ³-producing EBV-specific CD4 T-cells, suggesting an interplay between innate and adaptive immune compartments may be important for regulating EBV DNAemia.",2020,Medicine,"list(name = ""Victor H Ferreira"", ids = ""1993594""); list(name = ""Judah Batist"", ids = ""147026738""); list(name = ""Atul Humar"", ids = ""4768305""); list(name = ""Deepali Kumar"", ids = ""33494840"")",,,Transplantation,,
316a534d925765c3f38d2ab746002a6b1cb1304a,Genetic risk factors in thrombotic primary antiphospholipid syndrome: A systematic review with bioinformatic analyses.,"BACKGROUND
Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune multifactorial disorder. Genetics is believed to play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of APS, especially in thrombosis development and pregnancy morbidity. In the last 20 years, extensive research on genetic contribution on APS indicates that APS is a polygenic disorder, where a number of genes are involved in the development of its clinical manifestations.


AIMS
The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the genetic risk factors in thrombotic primary APS. Additionally, to assess the common molecular functions, biological processes, pathways, interrelations with the gene encoded proteins and RNA-Seq-derived expression patterns over different organs of the associated genes via bioinformatic analyses.


METHODS
Without restricting the year, a systematic search of English articles was conducted (up to 4th September 2017) using Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases. Eligible studies were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Two researchers independently extracted the data from the included studies. Quality assessment of the included studies was carried out using a modified New-Castle Ottawa scale (NOS).


RESULTS
From an initial search result of 2673 articles, 22 studies were included (1268 primary APS patients and 1649 healthy controls). Twenty-two genes were identified in which 16 were significantly associated with thrombosis in primary APS whereas six genes showed no significant association with thrombosis. Based on the NOS, 14 studies were of high quality while 6 were low quality studies. From the bioinformatic analyses, thrombin-activated receptor activity (qâ€¯=â€¯6.77â€¯Ã—â€¯10-7), blood coagulation (qâ€¯=â€¯2.63â€¯Ã—â€¯10-15), formation of fibrin clot (qâ€¯=â€¯9.76â€¯Ã—â€¯10-10) were the top hit for molecular function, biological process and pathway categories, respectively. With the highest confidence interaction score of 0.900, all of the thrombosis-associated gene encoded proteins of APS were found to be interconnected except for two. Based on the pathway analysis, cumulatively all the genes affect haemostasis [false discovery rate (FDR)â€¯=â€¯1.01â€¯Ã—â€¯10-8] and the immune system [FDRâ€¯=â€¯9.93â€¯Ã—â€¯10-2]. Gene expression analysis from RNA-Seq data revealed that almost all the genes were expressed in 32 different tissues in the human body.


CONCLUSION
According to our systematic review, 16 genes contribute significantly in patients with thrombotic primary APS when compared with controls. Bioinformatic analyses of these genes revealed their molecular interconnectivity in protein levels largely by affecting blood coagulation and immune system. These genes are expressed in 32 different organs and may pose higher risk of developing thrombosis anywhere in the body of primary APS patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Md Asiful Islam"", ids = ""7484202""); list(name = ""Shahad Saif Khandker"", ids = ""15772466""); list(name = ""Fahmida Alam"", ids = ""40067858""); list(name = ""Mohammad Amjad Kamal"", ids = ""144116099""); list(name = ""Siew Hua Gan"", ids = ""3233865"")",8d406f1837bf14a2a4f385f4c6b1778251105288; 2a212b6888f305eb8ebf87717376089805662746,,Autoimmunity reviews,17 3,"

7353d104cfc76afcffa9b8cb83ed67eba473dfff,Association between ALDH2 rs671 G>A polymorphism and gastric cancer susceptibility in Eastern Asia,"To date, the relationship between the aldehyde dehydrogenases-2 (ALDH2) rs671 G>A (Glu504Lys) polymorphism and gastric cancer (GC) risk has not been thoroughly elucidated. To derive a more precise estimation of the effect of the ALDH2 rs671 G>A polymorphism on GC, we conducted this meta-analysis. We searched for qualified studies in the Embase, PubMed, Wang Fan and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the association. A total of 6,421 GC patients and 8,832 control subjects were included in the present study. The pooled results indicated no significant relationship between the ALDH2 rs671 G>A polymorphism and GC susceptibility in all genetic models. A stratified analysis by country showed that the ALDH2 rs671 G>A polymorphism might be a risk factor for GC in Japan (Allele model: Punadjusted = 0.034; Dominant model: Punadjusted = 0.040); however, the result was nonsignificant when the Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate (FDR) were applied. In subgroup analyses by drinking status in the dominant model, our study revealed that the ALDH2 rs671 G>A polymorphism significantly increased the risk of GC for drinkers (dominant model: P < 0.001).

Here we investigate 8,342 mosaic chromosomal alterations, from 50Â kb to 249Â Mb long, that we uncovered in blood-derived DNA from 151,202 UK Biobank participants using phase-based computational techniques (estimated false discovery rate, 6â€“9%). We found six loci at which inherited variants associated strongly with the acquisition of deletions or loss of heterozygosity in cis. At three such loci (MPL, TM2D3â€“TARSL2, and FRA10B), we identified a likely causal variant that acted with high penetrance (5â€“50%). Inherited alleles at one locus appeared to affect the probability of somatic mutation, and at three other loci to be objects of positive or negative clonal selection. Several specific mosaic chromosomal alterations were strongly associated with future haematological malignancies. Our results reveal a multitude of paths towards clonal expansions with a wide range of effects on human health.Analysis of genotyping data for more than 150,000 individuals from the UK Biobank using long-range phase information sheds light on mechanisms of clonal haematopoiesis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Po-Ru Loh"", ids = ""144813435""); list(name = ""Giulio Genovese"", ids = ""48194393""); list(name = ""Robert E.

7a3f007454524f02b999d7020519ccc2e768ef33,Variants in angiogenesis-related genes and the risk of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Angiogenesis is fundamentally important to the pathogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We investigated the association between variations of genes related to angiogenesis and the risk of ccRCC. In a case-control study of 859 ccRCC patients and 1004 cancer-free subjects, we genotyped 24 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven angiogenesis-related genes (HIF1A, EPAS1, VEGFA, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3 and PDGFRB) using the TaqMan or Snapshot method. Unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounding factors, was used to assess the risk associations. The functionality of selected SNPs was assessed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and luciferase reporter gene assays. We found two SNPs (VEGFA rs2010963 and VEGFR3 rs448012) that were significantly associated with increased risk of ccRCC, after adjusting for multiple comparisons [rs2010963 CC/GC cf. GG: false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.048, odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.12-1.66; rs448012 CC/GC cf. GG: FDR = 0.048, OR = 1.38, 95% CI =1.13-1.69]. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the variant genotypes of rs2010963, but not rs448012, were associated with increased gene expression in normal tissues of ccRCC patients (CC/GC cf.

f8e7fbbf359daa883d9a228c41d308bd84fa4cd0,Influence of Helicobacter pylori Infection and Atrophic Gastritis on the Gut Microbiota in a Japanese Population.,"BACKGROUND
Although infection with Helicobacter pylori and subsequent atrophic gastritis modulate the gastric conditions, their relationship with the gut microbiota in -Japanese population has not been clearly characterized.


METHODS
A cohort of 1,123 subjects who participated in a health survey was studied. Infection of H. pylori was defined by both serum antibody and stool antigen test. The presence and severity of atrophic gastritis were defined by serum levels of pepsinogens. The relative abundance of each bacterial species in fecal samples was calculated by using 16S ribosomal RNA amplification, and the composition ratios of bacterial taxa were evaluated using propensity score matching.


RESULTS
The abundance of 3 orders, 4 families, and 4 genera was significantly higher in H. pylori-infected subjects than in noninfected subjects (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05). In H. pylori-infected subjects with severe atrophic gastritis, the abundance of the class Bacilli, order Lactobacillales, family Streptococcaceae, and genus Streptococcus was significantly higher than that in H. pylori-infected subjects without atrophic gastritis (FDR < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
A significant increase in the relative abundance of several taxa was observed in gut microbiota of Japanese subjects with H. pylori infection. Among the subjects with severe atrophic gastritis, the increase in the genus Streptococcus is a remarkable characteristic.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chikara Iino"", ids = ""13419239""); list(name = ""Tadashi Shimoyama"", ids = ""3989593""); list(name = ""Daisuke Chinda"", ids = ""14100379""); list(name = ""Hirotake Sakuraba"", ids = ""2771940""); list(name = ""Shinsaku Fukuda"", ids = ""2205974""); list(name = ""Shigeyuki Nakaji"", ids = ""6354909"")",fa7921005e46f624ee15f54369ce5d83327bed2c,,Digestion,,"

8f4bfc770e917145caee5df71ede862f59a1378b,Order under uncertainty: robust differential expression analysis using probabilistic models for pseudotime inference,"Single cell gene expression profiling can be used to quantify transcriptional dynamics in temporal processes, such as cell differentiation, using computational methods to label each cell with a â€˜pseudotimeâ€™ where true time series experimentation is too difficult to perform. However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Preexisting methods for pseudotime ordering have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates compared and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Kieran R.

933670401f09fefcc6ebee417801e1992bf58ce3,Alcohol Affects the Brain's Resting-State Network in Social Drinkers,"Acute alcohol intake is known to enhance inhibition through facilitation of GABA(A) receptors, which are present in 40% of the synapses all over the brain. Evidence suggests that enhanced GABAergic transmission leads to increased large-scale brain connectivity. Our hypothesis is that acute alcohol intake would increase the functional connectivity of the human brain resting-state network (RSN). To test our hypothesis, electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements were recorded from healthy social drinkers at rest, during eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions, after administering to them an alcoholic beverage or placebo respectively. Salivary alcohol and cortisol served to measure the inebriation and stress levels. By calculating Magnitude Square Coherence (MSC) on standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) solutions, we formed cortical networks over several frequency bands, which were then analyzed in the context of functional connectivity and graph theory. MSC was increased (p<0.05, corrected with False Discovery Rate, FDR corrected) in alpha, beta (eyes-open) and theta bands (eyes-closed) following acute alcohol intake. Graph parameters were accordingly altered in these bands quantifying the effect of alcohol on the structure of brain networks; global efficiency and density were higher and path length was lower during alcohol (vs. placebo, p<0.05). Salivary alcohol concentration was positively correlated with the density of the network in beta band. The degree of specific nodes was elevated following alcohol (vs. placebo). Our findings support the hypothesis that short-term inebriation considerably increases large-scale connectivity in the RSN. The increased baseline functional connectivity can -at least partially- be attributed to the alcohol-induced disruption of the delicate balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in favor of inhibitory influences. Thus, it is suggested that short-term inebriation is associated, as expected, to increased GABA transmission and functional connectivity, while long-term alcohol consumption may be linked to exactly the opposite effect.",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chrysa D.

1bedc7339222ceea0b4d86fea02ef2c52ca0d80c,"Filamin C, a dysregulated protein in cancer revealed by label-free quantitative proteomic analyses of human gastric cancer cells","Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth and fifth most common cancer in men and women, respectively. We identified 2,750 proteins at false discovery rates of 1.3% (protein) and 0.03% (spectrum) by comparing the proteomic profiles of three GC and a normal gastric cell lines. Nine proteins were significantly dysregulated in all three GC cell lines, including filamin C, a muscle-specific filamin and a large actin-cross-linking protein. Downregulation of filamin C in GC cell lines and tissues were verified using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Data-mining using public microarray datasets shown that filamin C was significantly reduced in many human primary and metastasis cancers. Transient expression or silencing of filamin C affected the proliferation and colony formation of cancer cells. Silencing of endogenous filamin C enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas ectopic expression of filamin C had opposing effects. Silencing of filamin C increased the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 2 and improved the metastasis of prostate cancer in a zebrafish model.

793c569e385451ba50d1143ea4ffe8181d51e9a6,Single-Cell RNAseq Reveals That Pancreatic Î²-Cells From Very Old Male Mice Have a Young Gene Signature.,"Aging improves pancreatic Î²-cell function in mice. This is a surprising finding because aging is typically associated with functional decline. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of Î²-cells from 3- and 26-month-old mice to explore how changes in gene expression contribute to improved function with age. The old mice were healthy and had reduced blood glucose levels and increased Î²-cell mass, which correlated to their body weight. Î²-Cells from young and old mice had similar transcriptome profiles. In fact, only 193 genes (0.89% of all detected genes) were significantly regulated (â‰¥2-fold; false discovery rate < 0.01; normalized counts > 5). Of these, 183 were down-regulated and mainly associated with pathways regulating gene expression, cell cycle, cell death, and survival as well as cellular movement, function, and maintenance. Collectively our data show that Î²-cells from very old mice have transcriptome profiles similar to those of young mice. These data support previous findings that aging is not associated with reduced Î²-cell mass or functional Î²-cell decline in mice.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yurong Xin"", ids = ""40448593""); list(name = ""Haruka Okamoto"", ids = ""145226775""); list(name = ""Jinrang Kim"", ids = ""9487197""); list(name = ""Min Min Ni"", ids = ""50666714""); list(name = ""Christina Adler"", ids = ""39208300""); list(name = ""Katie Cavino"", ids = ""7642402""); list(name = ""Erqian Na"", ids = ""6861107""); list(name = ""Andrew J.

905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492,Sequential selection procedures and false discovery rate control,"Summary 
 
We consider a multiple-hypothesis testing setting where the hypotheses are ordered and one is only permitted to reject an initial contiguous block of hypotheses. A rejection rule in this setting amounts to a procedure for choosing the stopping point k. This setting is inspired by the sequential nature of many model selection problems, where choosing a stopping point or a model is equivalent to rejecting all hypotheses up to that point and none thereafter. We propose two new testing procedures and prove that they control the false discovery rate in the ordered testing setting. We also show how the methods can be applied to model selection by using recent results on p-values in sequential model selection settings.",2013,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Max Jacob Grazier G'Sell"", ids = ""1405080955""); list(name = ""Stefan Wager"", ids = ""3160667""); list(name = ""Alexandra Chouldechova"", ids = ""2082393""); list(name = ""Robert Tibshirani"", ids = ""1761784"")",fcd349991127f368aae4c4819c3766ab5aa1da53; 42832e87d2ac18ba2e17d7c230951718e4e85663; d22e281b6d462ce455d83031faf4574413249291; b3e9c70969cb73096ce3df1065190a04e568a13a; ebf4e22d32cde5b287097960a2028bca535c2559; 57a7c5db6aaab825200b85beb0bebefaee15117c; 86885092af808d393dc915a0ff7096aa51d1705b; ff1dde8afaad78604042cdb1028b9c1c3bc0fd76; be3c5a496bf757b02681e38e6b44ba18ca26cb17; 224db746f2ca0b5ebd01c964d263180707a9776a; 3d4b179a8ea1e7ed76a6d77e232c3d1e2695f959; 9c878593318d379b8d890abdb4550dd78bfa27e2; d80580f6dcbead06cf82abb2c6ec88399f85921b; 9c445e726cb8ca9c05312f9642c2129d8396d71b; 0c61a23cf344b7cb200148f9b6516423268e3448; 6bd9a40e1b4d6439463e4455cb51ab678acf4df6; ab0ef9e2a4cea0ce865dbc4ef44824adc9b1af78; 55be25b6d2d0258cec752b41ee5ffb33f80ecede; 9ffe414f5a10ce85833aff1ff76f79abc38baa2c; 9a74ed5b09ee3c6d6f37159d8d02db85398dcd22; d78aba5c3593aa740983e5d09a88a373b7400f93; a9457a06fb1838e9c250ed2b5b7adcc37f57264c; 090b233a88ad0d0d31968745fe44c81a5a0e6dfe; 1f8d2d94b921047df4ee93f06ac4bf4f1432cebb; 1e18ad1d5a5311cfc801755fbf5a2c302116ffa1; 30875fc5e6a4972d16936d5235e84966d8cf3a81; 305600f3cba8a63bad1bedeab34a299bf748754b; 2217d3548de60fe0725cdc6185bfe2082b213f73; 3ba6d46203af2f81f6414a940fdff38e3a6dc32b; 7d2d8bdcdafda11ae3d7e5af4ef0c1b3890b7dd5; 894238fa0765b4caeba82223eb509cac7824ff8f; 88f70b66004dee51601d33cb3405d0cb97132826; e9dbed45506c8d79aa53a2ff97882a1a3c88ff29; d599569594724517a386d0152feb5568015ba82c; 32c303575935b2a995dcc52aee866d6e11d61c6b; 3564f17d529d0acdca6a3e75bea4fa5fe3ff6a37; e88099cadae70ab8cfc733ccee6b2c021734bd89; f55bac2b998da29070a054fd1621e02804eaff78; e67bcbbd1eec1eeea9827d802ee1b64753d31c95; 557897f76cc32bbf7cb42460a383755caf9bd0c3; 87a0338587be279887b3b1f0973135b59fb3222c; 00b7f44857676600805172e99be6f9f2987e98eb; 7ac54398e4bac7ff93313e34e19a6f2baa42f91b; dc0b537db6fc2d1d7ec02f7ae8eaef9db4eb7360; bf06b80f4df8c2afdad13ee9fbc258c4845bcdf7; 0204ae2b794d3f6e5f56c0fe631b71d91647d46e; bcb1f20b5a52cb340945d7e58526a3a23646046b; cc6b993746afe836e23bceb8c936b67b86a13631; 28b29ba8db35f001b33240676e3093f8cc73c27f; d07753fad3b1c25412ff7536176f54577604b1a1; 2a3cd075bd4c0c88117d5d217a8115a7f32cbddd; d463bfa2495c6c6629d73b9e8233222bc3ff87f3; a7f5ddee3d55d628eae68653dc3b34ffcd2d2075; 52afbc1e9c1b16d9365d25ebe7f60bb973282bcb; c16c52b5e973ca4b4726375863090c253b8dad24; 985bd53dc68385aad3be0b825e739e1bc7a4014a; 89498cec05a1ae11a0ec2d06d71197ba439cc29d; e57bf28b32346e3e97da0bab925b5c831dcb3b30; e19ccba0bbd24e77d3f4b2a0af4e0cfe5b43fc6e; f8742d1b3ac8260c23735aa69297bc8958d997be; 1851f8e4bd336629401fba078205078df5ee570e; 4cf0d393dc8e407881858abb7101f8535f79c47d; 3b4c2ea7458cfddaf48b95e23444eaa1380b0d8a; b7ef0955b77aa1dd521322e738a6e12ca8a1f9ba; 9e8efd072240b6eeb6d39b82395a2ccb143d7774; 2a996166c3e3c9373981d3fc1f60b71957987ead; d6e477e034b0edd0ba217f8f83c0703f08cd3871; 462e24910b71ac2895f18dc46d94237dc20fece0; 2c7f0e99635e0326f609aca0d4b70ef291a665db; 53cad19c6fceba2c9827922a2bc649e3eabf4758; 48c365fb304da4cad6389df84d8dac2828724d77; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 0a874e06256b70f967fd4d96675e61264c387fd5; ad8c152b67cdd6ad302414f1fa89824f1b92638b; 9d4e77b6d2487bdd6edcd9826ca039a4341fdc3d; e1d8c9d28e2a5275b5d531d678d5544bede3fdee; 2aff3e8dcf12ef85a98bb6aad3ee5a6b1f3646ea,2eabb8356f91dd59b409a0ca5ff3404e69ab0265; 418a3b95fb6f4d18f8fcf1280225f8d95e2d6625; d980b4feeb48a66791305ae2543d0df32d8a2f1d; 83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; 9e87e9739fd6638af415d2ac11a4c6d70cb05109; f31743a37671d0cab926ccaf28ffc579582cbdae; 7093141507b6e945230bbffd137312a9cefb082c; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f4cb9f17ca81025a002b9ba20bd7662bf30b76eb; 66fa6d8f057a2fac0cc80112364bec7ad9088101; 7392606ea0e46f73b7efcf9a4d1f636c67bd29ee,Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology,78,423-444
630ef1793d323542dfc3a3f17dc5c26fa381e7c7,Application of Survival and Meta-analysis to Gene Expression Data Combined from Two Studies,"The application of gene expression microarray technology has the potential to have a large impact in the area of oncology. There is a need to be able to identify genes associated with prolonged or reduced survival, to aid decisions regarding patient treatment and care. In addition these genes can be targeted in drug research to aid discovery and development of novel treatments. This paper uses two published Affymetrix datasets and combines the information from adenocarcinoma lung tumors to identify genes associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards models and analysis of variance are used for the data analyses. The results are combined across the two datasets using Fisherâ€™s chi-squared meta-analysis based on p-value aggregation. The false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment is made to the final pvalues.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Linda C.

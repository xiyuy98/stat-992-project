0d7a9bf5b5552b6a9cb92dde31ba645622f852f6,Gene Ontology analysis in multiple gene clusters under multiple hypothesis testing framework,"OBJECTIVE
Gene Ontology (GO) has become a routine resource for functional analysis of gene lists. Although a number of tools have been provided to identify enriched GO terms in one or two gene lists, two technical challenges remain. First, how to handle multiple hypothesis testing in the analysis given that the tests are heavily correlated; second, how to identify GO terms that are enriched in a gene cluster, as compared to multiple other gene clusters. We provide a statistical procedure to rigorously treat these problems and offer a software tool for applying GO to the analysis of gene clusters.


METHODS
We previously introduced a statistical procedure that handles hypothesis testing in a two-group comparison scenario. In this paper we extend the two-group comparison procedure into a general procedure that enables the analysis of any number of gene lists/clusters. This new procedure enables identification of GO terms enriched in any gene cluster, while it controls for multiple hypothesis testing. This procedure is implemented into a user-friendly analysis tool: GoSurfer. The current version of GoSurfer takes one or several gene lists as input, and it identifies the GO terms that are enriched in any of the input gene lists. GoSurfer estimates a conservative false discovery rate (FDR) for every GO term. The FDR estimation procedure in GoSurfer has two advantages: it does not rely on independence assumption, and it does not assume all the hypotheses are null hypothesis (complete null). Thus GoSurfer's FDR estimates are mildly conservative rather than overly conservative.


RESULTS
We implemented the new procedure for GO analysis in multiple gene clusters into the GoSurfer software. We provide three examples on using GoSurfer to analyze time course gene expression data sets on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells. In the example of analysis of multiple gene clusters, we first used a typical clustering algorithm and identified five gene clusters, representing up-regulation, down-regulation and other patterns in the differentiation time course. Taking all the five gene clusters as input data, GoSurfer reports ""cell adhesion"" and ""muscle contraction"" as significant GO terms for the up-regulated cluster, ""amino acids metabolism"" as a significant GO term for the down-regulated gene cluster, and GoSurfer reports a number of GO terms related to RNA processing and RNA transport as significant terms to a cluster that is up-regulated in both early and late time points. This may suggest that genes for RNA processing and genes for RNA transport are coregulated in the differentiation process of embryonic stem cells.


CONCLUSION
The GoSurfer software is provided to analyze multiple gene clusters and identify GO terms that are enriched in any gene cluster.

Animal studies have linked prenatal DES exposure to lasting DNA methylation changes. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation and in utero DES exposure in a sample of non-Hispanic white women aged 40-59 years from the Sister Study, a large United States cohort study of women with a family history of breast cancer. Using questionnaire information from women and their mothers, we selected 100 women whose mothers reported taking DES while pregnant and 100 control women whose mothers had not taken DES. DNA methylation in blood was measured at 485,577 CpG sites using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Associations between CpG methylation and DES exposure status were analyzed using robust linear regression with adjustment for blood cell composition and multiple comparisons. Although four CpGs had p<105, after accounting for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR), none reached genome-wide significance. In conclusion, adult women exposed to DES in utero had no evidence of large persistent changes in blood DNA methylation.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sophia Harlid"", ids = ""3560252""); list(name = ""Zongli Xu"", ids = ""3208590""); list(name = ""Vijayalakshmi Panduri"", ids = ""50631947""); list(name = ""Aimee A.

fe5c84ec165b4a16205b71e2542d1bff56b07b11,Brain glucose and acetoacetate metabolism: a comparison of young and older adults,"The extent to which the age-related decline in regional brain glucose uptake also applies to other important brain fuels is presently unknown. Ketones are the brain's major alternative fuel to glucose, so we developed a dual tracer positron emission tomography protocol to quantify and compare regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose and the ketone, acetoacetate. Twenty healthy young adults (mean age, 26 years) and 24 healthy older adults (mean age, 74 years) were studied. In comparison with younger adults, older adults had 8 Â± 6% (mean Â± SD) lower cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in gray matter as a whole (p = 0.035), specifically in several frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions, as well as in the cingulate and insula (p â‰¤ 0.01, false discovery rate correction). The effect of age on cerebral metabolic rates for acetoacetate in gray matter did not reach significance (p = 0.11). Rate constants (min(-1)) of glucose (Kg) and acetoacetate (Ka) were significantly lower (-11 Â± 6%; [p = 0.005], and -19 Â± 5%; [p = 0.006], respectively) in older adults compared with younger adults. There were differential effects of age on Kg and Ka as seen by significant interaction effects in the caudate (p = 0.030) and post-central gyrus (p = 0.023). The acetoacetate index, which expresses the scaled residuals of the voxel-wise linear regression of glucose on ketone uptake, identifies regions taking up higher or lower amounts of acetoacetate relative to glucose.

0b84b14c93fc432dde87d62d0b036ea91476e14b,An evaluation of multidimensional fingerprinting in the context of clinical proteomics.,"Multidimensional fingerprinting (MDF) utilizes measurable peptide characteristics to identify proteins. In this study, 3-D fingerprinting, namely, parent protein molecular weight, peptide mass, and peptide retention time on RPLC, is used to identify 331 differentially expressed proteins between normal and human colon cancer plasma membrane samples. A false discovery rate (FDR) procedure is introduced to evaluate the performance of MDF on the colon cancer dataset. This evaluation establishes a false protein identification rate below 15% for this dataset. Western blot analysis is performed to validate the differential expression of the MDF-identified protein VDAC1 on the original tissue samples. The limits of MDF are further assessed by a simulation study where key parameters such as database size, query size, and mass accuracy are varied. The results of this simulation study demonstrate that fingerprinting with three dimensions yields low FDR values even for large queries on the complete human proteome without the need for prior peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. Specifically, when mass accuracy is 10â€…ppm or lower, full human proteome searches can achieve FDR values of 10% or less.",2007,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kossi Lekpor"", ids = ""46340064""); list(name = ""Marie-JosÃ©e BenoÃ®t"", ids = ""8933922""); list(name = ""Heather A.

0e1f6b5b202c3da3481f06c9e85ee328474e11ee,Towards Accurate Estimation of the Proportion of True Null Hypotheses in Multiple Testing,"BACKGROUND
Biomedical researchers are now often faced with situations where it is necessary to test a large number of hypotheses simultaneously, eg, in comparative gene expression studies using high-throughput microarray technology. To properly control false positive errors the FDR (false discovery rate) approach has become widely used in multiple testing. The accurate estimation of FDR requires the proportion of true null hypotheses being accurately estimated. To date many methods for estimating this quantity have been proposed. Typically when a new method is introduced, some simulations are carried out to show the improved accuracy of the new method. However, the simulations are often very limited to covering only a few points in the parameter space.


RESULTS
Here I have carried out extensive in silico experiments to compare some commonly used methods for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses. The coverage of these simulations is unprecedented thorough over the parameter space compared to typical simulation studies in the literature. Thus this work enables us to draw conclusions globally as to the performance of these different methods. It was found that a very simple method gives the most accurate estimation in a dominantly large area of the parameter space. Given its simplicity and its overall superior accuracy I recommend its use as the first choice for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses in multiple testing.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shu-Dong Zhang"", ids = ""47180861"")",61e45b702ee7317d3107e1ac2e47d773783efe51; 5d33df966768d1c3a54093b2a005d7e84eb2ae1c; b6b569ba2134b9f00e822c09105edffd2a8c754d; 6e17b51cca2878ecedf32afe6e6e5059b6e5d2b0; 24f93b2ebe95bbe215deb21108d78ea3c214ad72; 6a62e34180fe8ca88cda0c01e72d64b104c195eb; 54a53d54ee62ed69b15e24813a38987145806f4d,a15e1f238fc526b86c50ee0945b17ea2cee8fbdc; ba752ea314297d1954263c8e5d341bb2dde4b1e5; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; 3f2627e0d856e3acfe1a67461119c7a36c19ee13; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; f1e7570781fba2ac576049f589308fcf794ec768; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 165a562c4659cb03b504301454784b8265d7b8f8; 7e8b9a9b5922e5f948f2e4c935afd19779c804e3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; f6be8799ed27b63066df94c47772b10fae99ea5c; c94b01ee799fd806d33d6391dc14b51ce36a7afd,PLoS ONE,6,

Wright and Andrew Nobel) In modern applications of high-throughput technologies, it is important to identify pairwise associations between variables, and desirable to use methods that are powerful and sensitive to a variety of association relationships. In the first part of the dissertation, we describe RankCover, a new non-parametric association test for association between two variables that measures the concentration of paired ranked points. Here â€˜concentrationâ€™ is quantified using a disk-covering statistic that is similar to those employed in spatial data analysis. Analysis of simulated datasets demonstrates that the method is robust and often powerful in comparison to competing general association tests. We also illustrate RankCover in the analysis of several real datasets. Using RankCover, we also propose a method of testing the association of two variables while controlling the effect of a third variable. In the second part of the dissertation, we describe statistical methodologies for testing hypotheses that can be collected into groups, with each group showing potentially different characteristics. Methods to control family-wise error rate or false discovery rate for group testing have been proposed earlier, but may not easily apply to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data, for which certain structured alternatives may be defensible and enable the researcher to avoid overly conservative approaches. In an empirical Bayesian setting, we propose a new method to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for grouped hypothesis data.

However, the changes in expression of genes that drive these processes remain incompletely characterised. RNA-seq is the new gold standard for whole transcriptome analysis but so far there are no reports of its application to analysis of differential gene expression in cattle liver. We used RNA-seq to study differences in expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in individual cattle in either mild negative energy balance (MNEB) or severe negative energy balance (SNEB). NEB is an imbalance between energy intake and energy requirements for lactation and body maintenance. This aberrant metabolic state affects high-yielding dairy cows after calving and is of considerable economic importance because of its negative impact on fertility and health in dairy herds. Analysis of changes in hepatic gene expression in SNEB animals will increase our understanding of NEB and contribute to the development of strategies to circumvent it.ResultsRNA-seq analysis was carried out on total RNA from liver from early post partum Holstein Friesian cows in MNEB (nâ€‰=â€‰5) and SNEB (nâ€‰=â€‰6). 12,833 genes were deemed to be expressed (>4 reads per gene per animal), 413 of which were shown to be statistically significantly differentially expressed (SDE) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% and 200 of which were SDE (FDR of 0.1%) with a â‰¥2-fold change between MNEB and SNEB animals. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that SDE genes with â‰¥2- fold change were associated (P <0.05) with 9 KEGG pathways. Seven of these pathways were related to fatty acid metabolism and unexpectedly included â€˜Steroid hormone biosynthesisâ€™, a process which mainly occurs in the reproductive organs rather than the liver.ConclusionsRNA-seq analysis showed that the major changes at the level of transcription in the liver of SNEB cows were related to fat metabolism. 'Steroid hormone biosynthesis', a process that normally occurs in reproductive tissue, was significantly associated with changes in gene expression in the liver of SNEB cows. Changes in gene expression were found in this pathway that have not been previously been identified in SNEB cows.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew Sean McCabe"", ids = ""2155110""); list(name = ""SinÃ©ad M Waters"", ids = ""3956205""); list(name = ""Dermot Morris"", ids = ""2390571""); list(name = ""David Anthony Kenny"", ids = ""2903374""); list(name = ""David J.

1d4f6eea95f5527291514ee1fbe42edb6771b832,A common neonatal image phenotype predicts adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in children born preterm,"Diffuse white matter injury is common in preterm infants and is a candidate substrate for later cognitive impairment. This injury pattern is associated with morphological changes in deep grey nuclei, the localization of which is uncertain. We test the hypotheses that diffuse white matter injury is associated with discrete focal tissue loss, and that this image phenotype is associated with impairment at 2years. We acquired magnetic resonance images from 80 preterm infants at term equivalent (mean gestational age 29(+6)weeks) and 20 control infants (mean GA 39(+2)weeks). Diffuse white matter injury was defined by abnormal apparent diffusion coefficient values in one or more white matter region (frontal, central or posterior white matter at the level of the centrum semiovale), and morphological difference between groups was calculated from 3D images using deformation based morphometry. Neurodevelopmental assessments were obtained from preterm infants at a mean chronological age of 27.5months, and from controls at a mean age of 31.1months. We identified a common image phenotype in 66 of 80 preterm infants at term equivalent comprising: diffuse white matter injury; and tissue volume reduction in the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, the globus pallidus, periventricular white matter, the corona radiata and within the central region of the centrum semiovale (t=4.42 p<0.001 false discovery rate corrected). The abnormal image phenotype is associated with reduced median developmental quotient (DQ) at 2years (DQ=92) compared with control infants (DQ=112), p<0.001. These findings indicate that specific neural systems are susceptible to maldevelopment after preterm birth, and suggest that neonatal image phenotype may serve as a useful biomarker for studying mechanisms of injury and the effect of putative therapeutic interventions.",2010,Psychology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""James P.

7966f10d832f8eb9e8c387a1a71dc712f400f3ef,Comparison of seven methods for producing Affymetrix expression scores based on False Discovery Rates in disease profiling data,"BackgroundA critical step in processing oligonucleotide microarray data is combining the information in multiple probes to produce a single number that best captures the expression level of a RNA transcript. Several systematic studies comparing multiple methods for array processing have used tightly controlled calibration data sets as the basis for comparison. Here we compare performances for seven processing methods using two data sets originally collected for disease profiling studies. An emphasis is placed on understanding sensitivity for detecting differentially expressed genes in terms of two key statistical determinants: test statistic variability for non-differentially expressed genes, and test statistic size for truly differentially expressed genes.ResultsIn the two data sets considered here, up to seven-fold variation across the processing methods was found in the number of genes detected at a given false discovery rate (FDR). The best performing methods called up to 90% of the same genes differentially expressed, had less variable test statistics under randomization, and had a greater number of large test statistics in the experimental data. Poor performance of one method was directly tied to a tendency to produce highly variable test statistic values under randomization. Based on an overall measure of performance, two of the seven methods (Dchip and a trimmed mean approach) are superior in the two data sets considered here. Two other methods (MAS5 and GCRMA-EB) are inferior, while results for the other three methods are mixed.ConclusionsChoice of processing method has a major impact on differential expression analysis of microarray data. Previously reported performance analyses using tightly controlled calibration data sets are not highly consistent with results reported here using data from human tissue samples. Performance of array processing methods in disease profiling and other realistic biological studies should be given greater consideration when comparing Affymetrix processing methods.",2004,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Kerby Shedden"", ids = ""2138957""); list(name = ""Wei Chen"", ids = ""50504401""); list(name = ""Rork Kuick"", ids = ""1931325""); list(name = ""Debashis Ghosh"", ids = ""145165051""); list(name = ""James W.

4aa832e8bf2fa9c68b6243ff16d5cba833adf0a5,Down-regulation of RIP3 potentiates cisplatin chemoresistance by triggering HSP90-ERK pathway mediated DNA repair in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) is a critical regulator of programmed necrotic cell death. Here, we observed that RIP3 was significantly down-regulated in esophageal cancer. And its remaining expression was associated with better response to chemotherapy and prolonged survival. Notably, re-expression of kinase-dead RIP3 also restored cisplatin sensitivity, suggesting that some roles of RIP3 beyond necroptosis may be involved in cisplatin-based chemosensitivity. To investigate the mechanisms, a large-scale quantitative proteomics study was performed after cisplatin treatment in RIP3-knockdown cells. In total, approximately 7000 protein groups were confidently identified, with a false discovery rate of 0.21% at the protein level. Of these proteins, 685 displayed RIP3-dependent changes in abundance. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that DNA repair pathway was stimulated after RIP3 depletion. Functional studies showed that deficient RIP3 upregulated FOSL1 and POLD1 through activation of the HSP90/CDC37 complex and ERK phosphorylation in multiple cell lines. Furthermore, via inhibition of the HSP90/CDC37 complex, ERK and FOSL1 reversed the cisplatin resistance phenotype. These results suggest that RIP3 regulates cisplatin sensitivity through both pronecrotic and non-necrotic functions. RIP3 may be a potential marker for predicting chemosensitivity.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yulin Sun"", ids = ""49696842""); list(name = ""Linhui Zhai"", ids = ""38179988""); list(name = ""Shouzhi Ma"", ids = ""3570466""); list(name = ""Chengpu Zhang"", ids = ""5612443""); list(name = ""Lina Zhao"", ids = ""144405408""); list(name = ""Ning Li"", ids = ""47576813""); list(name = ""Yang Xu"", ids = ""23127349""); list(name = ""Tao Zhang"", ids = ""1689115""); list(name = ""Zhimin Guo"", ids = ""2045553""); list(name = ""Heng Zhang"", ids = ""48213075""); list(name = ""Ping Xu"", ids = ""145767092""); list(name = ""Xiaohang Zhao"", ids = ""7908649"")",107ade563479010c953ce4cf508aba562949d1bc; a415fb300da098962779bb90efb1eb6a26203c3e; 4e23684c72559b038a627bb56581c650a34de3be; b9d47364263c57a7e6754085e476fd4ddfc6897a; 8567a84eaa48996af7b546ddf839b8b3c9567698; 01255361071a4907194843d57f17c2a61eef7953; 466c39e3cdd1dcbb055053c1563e271d5a99e400; c16de18b02a3531926681c1e9ee82ff721804303; b00e151214623afbe245bc64f9ec7e9f5eea34d7; 7f8e79b05a899d5daace9fd61c825deaad4d4171; 5624633439ba30f8fc2f8af3bfbbedbea1343cd8; 81bdf2201d217c1da2b8dd9459c502329e7245ee,,Cancer letters,418,"

837f2f52f8fc66c524803efd5658761393c5cd4a,IPAD: Stable Interpretable Forecasting with Knockoffs Inference,"Interpretability and stability are two important features that are desired in many contemporary big data applications arising in economics and finance. While the former is enjoyed to some extent by many existing forecasting approaches, the latter in the sense of controlling the fraction of wrongly discovered features which can enhance greatly the interpretability is still largely underdeveloped in the econometric settings. To this end, in this paper we exploit the general framework of model-X knockoffs introduced recently in Cand\`{e}s, Fan, Janson and Lv (2018), which is nonconventional for reproducible large-scale inference in that the framework is completely free of the use of p-values for significance testing, and suggest a new method of intertwined probabilistic factors decoupling (IPAD) for stable interpretable forecasting with knockoffs inference in high-dimensional models. The recipe of the method is constructing the knockoff variables by assuming a latent factor model that is exploited widely in economics and finance for the association structure of covariates. Our method and work are distinct from the existing literature in that we estimate the covariate distribution from data instead of assuming that it is known when constructing the knockoff variables, our procedure does not require any sample splitting, we provide theoretical justifications on the asymptotic false discovery rate control, and the theory for the power analysis is also established. Several simulation examples and the real data analysis further demonstrate that the newly suggested method has appealing finite-sample performance with desired interpretability and stability compared to some popularly used forecasting methods.",2018,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yingying Fan"", ids = ""40348704""); list(name = ""Jinchi Lv"", ids = ""35118626""); list(name = ""Mahrad Sharifvaghefi"", ids = ""80820245""); list(name = ""Yoshimasa Uematsu"", ids = ""40974728"")",b89904af131755c692e4dd5044f3fb91b6b232f0; f7345d1bc72175a2213dac2ac07e867efd3900d7,6bd9a40e1b4d6439463e4455cb51ab678acf4df6; 8dbc78c1ff1742643f32c9b4d37e64b494fb719a; ed9716278a7dedc4699622c5a0a9a3ca76740728; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; f75b70c9d7078724b592ec3e21de705e7b6ff73f; 3405880c8faca87b2a500579d051930de26567c7; c33d5ba2d9fa1649eeae95bcacb6a1941f0a8e24; f71fd7a5f6ac710bec87cd08c5cb396d471f4309; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 2ae4cbaf4a3aff6a200e1cdc46ef867d604deb7f; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; deaafb99a72e81af87f961662410f9bcefa37c0a; 7d8096a78105a8284e74e9ee0340e589fc502b93; ec30899ea0e5a2edf501e7319c285c15d1100022; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 98da9d46e4c442945bfd88db72be177e7a198fd3; 1a2b5877f6849192fc415539844b98c08b239c02; 2888f87e01c7adfd95f02c52339a7db8ad329677; 25d76bc2c0389e4ea3f9e8921c22b3a08c27bdbd; 5f56320c5979faeab78dbd9ddb7db755ba4550f3; 1cd88161e6f36704c2a75f5656fcf9527d931de0; 276be991dd62a963a46ebd83cd05fc431c0ac322; 5ae6925babd76cb966d7e0147a23cb7644204b39; 9542f16f46fec8f7afef2dc6d7eb8b7d755d7354; f2e01223509292a0e2829046ded30baea2e21a3a; 535ca23d1a06f921bdcd281d03363a111db03d3a; 79ee6103a4a8efa556693810d513216ba0a9cc7c; 4406c54f40e0f73db2180704d454951649df32f2; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 3f9dab37087dfe50d8e8fc8aedd3c0c899ece8fc; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 1d189a836b92b4fd21bd201c0c75fba70ddedd0f; b9e0bc8ff323d35b43e88001c1396494751427cc; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 62f82f7777cef270b34231bdd19a8987cb60b97d; e83971a3970b3ede362e64b93c036b229a105fea; 16a70227704882f5506794720c600dc29a00ada1; 49a7a54d8532f3925b8e9d3ec0cbf7cd114f3169,ArXiv,abs/1809.05032,
b43996b4ece2b1d64382176f6631f6264b992712,Sex Differences of the Phosphoproteomic Profiles in APP/PS1 Mice after Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress.,"Approximately two-thirds of those suffering with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are women, however, the biological mechanisms underlying this sex divergence of AD prevalence remain unknown. Previous research has shown sex-specific biochemical differences that bias female mice toward pro-AD signaling on the phosphoproteomic level via corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor 1 activation after CRF overexpression. Here we aimed to determine if chronic stress would induce a similar response in AD mouse models. We stressed 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm for up to 1 month. Following CUMS and behavioral assessments, we quantified whole protein and phosphoprotein levels in the cortex of stressed and non-stressed APP/PS1 mice using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. While there were no statistically significant differences at the total protein and peptide abundance levels, we found 909 and 841 statistically significant phosphopeptides between stressed and unstressed females and males, respectively, using a false discovery rate of 5%. Of these significant phosphopeptides, only 301 were the same in males and females. These results indicate that while both males and females undergo protein phosphorylation changes following stress, the peptides that are phosphorylated differ between sexes. We then used Metacore analysis to determine which biological pathways were affected. We found that several pathways were changed differently between male and female mice including NMDA receptor trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, and tau pathology. The differing biological pathways affected between males and females in response to chronic stress may help us to better understand why women are at a higher risk of AD.",2020,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sky Dominguez"", ids = ""144720351""); list(name = ""Guadalupe CarriÃ³n RodrÃ­guez"", ids = ""66567910""); list(name = ""Hossein Fazelinia"", ids = ""46845754""); list(name = ""Hua Ding"", ids = ""144774673""); list(name = ""Lynn A Spruce"", ids = ""40309498""); list(name = ""Steven Seeholzer"", ids = ""90142825""); list(name = ""H Dong"", ids = ""34882670"")",,,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,,
839f8cce6c8780796bb51d78c5cb6cc2e02182e6,New Anticoagulant Agents: Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions and New Signals Thereof,"Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the adverse drug reaction (ADR) incidence rate and new signals thereof for classic compared with new anticoagulants in realâ€life ambulatory settings. The authors performed an observational crossâ€sectional study in two cohorts of surveyed patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; acenocoumarol or warfarin) or nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs; apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate). Descriptive, clinical, and ADRs data were reported and analyzed through a bivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR]) to compare the ADRs incidence rate and an adaptation of Bayesian methodology (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) to detect new signals. A total of 334 patients were surveyedâ€”average international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.6â€”and 45.4% taking new anticoagulants. Note that 835 ADRs were reported; 2.5 per patient (2.8 in the VKA cohort, 2.1 in the NOAC cohort). The authors obtained higher risk of epistaxis (OR, 2.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01â€4.74) and hematoma (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.39â€4.25) with VKAs and lower risk of global bleeding symptoms with NOACs (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28â€0.71). After standardizing the data, a significant risk of diarrhea with VKAs was observed (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.09â€10.41).

3f2627e0d856e3acfe1a67461119c7a36c19ee13,Estimating the Proportion of Equivalently Expressed Genes in Microarray Data Based on Transformed Test Statistics,"In microarray data analysis, false discovery rate (FDR) is now widely accepted as the control criterion to account for multiple hypothesis testing. The proportion of equivalently expressed genes (pi(0)) is a key component to be estimated in the estimation of FDR. Some commonly used pi(0) estimators (BUM, SPLOSH, QVALUE, and LBE ) are all based on p-values, and they are essentially upper bounds of pi(0). The simulations we carried out show that these four methods significantly overestimate the true pi(0) when differentially expressed genes and equivalently expressed genes are not well separated. To solve this problem, we first introduce a novel way of transforming the test statistics to make them symmetric about 0. Then we propose a pi(0) estimator based on the transformed test statistics using the symmetry assumption. Real data application and simulation both show that the pi(0) estimate from our method is less conservative than BUM, SPLOSH, QVALUE, and LBE in most of the cases. Simulation results also show that our estimator always has the least mean squared error among these five methods.",2010,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shuo Jiao"", ids = ""2984344""); list(name = ""Shunpu Zhang"", ids = ""33687207"")",2b4dc8d2bd0fd6b0b893c4ef8391414bfb17f561; 0e1f6b5b202c3da3481f06c9e85ee328474e11ee; f847145cbbaf3a6a5b343f7b6d9858a2fb5014fe,0274982ca43e28442d403fb3b2387f6d52d3a8c7; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; e5ae252598bcf21cdfa520446d5cd0619036948a; d3001913e21d745ea6a430077869bb290ad86cc6; 1dacdff17355ff43458a93c2c7b639959a308cb4; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 43db684dc246d0f28a36b7cec3b84f1fe2cef0b4; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; fa233cb81da77f2de8f84e9ab9aa0a2670f4eb8a; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 0acec919dfb7485853f190dcd77baf15a640e7ac; 42a05722ecbd5e71ac5879f50eaf1dcd1fc17e28; f731f5810b79982cdd5da5330ee98e54f9c34be4; b81e61b920b986ff1495af426aad7437c9011d85; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; 5ab16225a2597b93a5c7ef9863d6bf2a6fcb48d2; 05b0d71e861f971e6c6d25af4fb908e0f0c174fe; a380e424e71ee719ef326d38f2baee2f32752d23; 41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; fe4b07489942fc80654e9a87663aee3aa5119429,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,17 2,"

0a58c9f6be16da8f8f28e46eb1fa85f0a6e59e0e,Haplotype association analysis of genes within the WNT signalling pathways in diabetic nephropathy,"BackgroundRenal interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis are hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and several studies have implicated members of the WNT pathways in these pathological processes. This study comprehensively examined common genetic variation within the WNT pathway for association with DN.MethodsGenes within the WNT pathways were selected on the basis of nominal significance and consistent direction of effect in the GENIE meta-analysis dataset. Common SNPs and common haplotypes were examined within the selected WNT pathway genes in a white population with type 1 diabetes, discordant for DN (cases: nâ€‰=â€‰718; controls: nâ€‰=â€‰749). SNPs were genotyped using Sequenom or Taqman assays. Association analyses were performed using PLINK, to compare allele and haplotype frequencies in cases and controls. Correction for multiple testing was performed by either permutation testing or using false discovery rate.ResultsA logistic regression model including collection centre, duration of diabetes, and average HbA1c as covariates highlighted three SNPs in GSK3B (rs17810235, rs17471, rs334543), two in DAAM1 (rs1253192, rs1252906) and one in NFAT5 (rs17297207) as being significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) associated with DN, however these SNPs did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Logistic regression of haplotypes, with ESRD as the outcome, and pairwise interaction analyses did not yield any significant results after correction for multiple testing.ConclusionsThese results indicate that both common SNPs and common haplotypes of WNT pathway genes are not strongly associated with DN. However, this does not completely exclude these or the WNT pathways from association with DN, as unidentified rare genetic or copy number variants could still contribute towards the genetic architecture of DN.",2013,Medicine,"list(name = ""David Kavanagh"", ids = ""38099971""); list(name = ""David A.

0c36d327f5140afabb8d40be1a4f8ac8e06af74c,BRAIN AdvancedMRIMorphologic Study Shows No Atrophy in Healthy Individuals with Hippocampal Hyperintensity,"SUMMARY: Wehave already shown that brainMR imaging of healthy individuals frequently reveals either unilateral or bilateral Hh, which is considered a hallmark of hippocampal sclerosis.We performed a follow-up (5-year interval) clinical and advanced imaging study of these individuals to address whether Hhmay havemasked occult brain atrophy or contributed to a later onset of epilepsy. Subjects with Hh (n 13) underwent a detailed clinical-imaging protocol, with a 3T scan and were studied with automated hippocampal segmentation (FreeSurfer), whole brain voxel-basedmorphometry, and shape analysis. All 13 subjects withHh had normal neurologic examination findingswith no cognitive impairment. Multimodal structural neuroimaging methods did not show clear evidence of significant volumetric changes between subjects with orwithout Hh.We clearly showed that Hh is not associatedwith any occult brain atrophy; furthermore, none of the healthy subjects with MR imaging evidence of Hh developed epilepsy or trouble with cognition. ABBREVIATIONS: FDR false discovery rate; Hh hippocampal hyperintensity; Hs hippocampal sclerosis; TLE temporal lobe epilepsy; VBM voxel-based morphometry Since the 1990s, MR imaging evidence of hippocampal atrophy and Hh has become a highly sensitive and specific marker of Hs and TLE. More recently, we have shown that MR imaging evidence of Hs is present in a third of patients with drug-responsive TLE, a finding that indicates that Hs itself does not necessarily mean intractable epilepsy. In daily clinical practice, it has become increasingly clear that MR imaging signs of Hs must always be carefully interpreted because they may occur as incidental findings in patients without epilepsy. Most important, we recently found, in approximately 25% of healthy controls, either unilateral or bilateral Hh, whereas hippocampal atrophy, whether or not associated with hyperintensity, was seen exclusively in patients with TLE. Obviously, we could have potentially missed minor hippocampal anomalies contributing to Hh, and we could not definitively exclude a later onset of epilepsy. In the present study, we sought to address these issues by conducting a 3T MR imaging study in the same population of controls. We also used 3 different advanced structural neuroimaging operator-independent approaches, called shape analysis, voxelbased morphometry, and automated hippocampal segmentation (FreeSurfer; http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) to determine whether Hh seen on visual MR imaging could have masked occult atrophy. METHODS Subjects and MR Imaging Protocol Since January 2012, fifty-one healthy volunteers were recontacted from our previous study. Four subjects were excluded due to unavailability. The remaining 47 controls (24 women; mean age, 39.3 10.8 years) underwent telephone interviews by 2 trained epileptologists (A.L. and A.G.) to document the absence of seizures and normal neurologic history in each individual. None of the volunteers had any contraindications to MR imaging, and they were re-invited to undergo MR imaging as part of our neuroimaging study. Brain MR imaging was performed according to our routine protocol by a 3T scanner with an 8-channel head coil (Discovery MR750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) at the Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Neurologic Sciences, National Research Council, Catanzaro, Italy. Structural MR imaging data were acquired by using a 3D T1weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: TR, 3.7 ms; TE, 9.2 ms; flip angle, 12Â°; voxel-size, 1 1 1 mm. Subjects were positioned comfortably in the scanner with a forehead-restraining strap and various foam pads to ensure head fixation.

The MR imaging diagnosis of Hh was based on the occurrence of the neuroimaging alterations that are considered reliable indicators of Hh: an increased mesial temporal signal intensity alteration on FLAIR or T2 images, or both. Of the entire group, 13 subjects showed FLAIR Hh at previous scanning, confirmed by 3T; these subjects with Hh were compared with a matched group without Hh. The mean follow-up was 5 years (range, 4 â€“ 6 years). They also underwent neurologic and cognitive evaluations. The participants signed a consent form approved by the University Committee for Protection of Human Subjects in Research. Shape Analysis T1-weighted images were processed by using the fMRI of the Brain Software Library 4.1 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fsl-4.1.9/ fsl/linux.html) tools. FMRIBâ€™s Integrated Registration Segmentation Tool, Volume 1.2, was used to automatically segment ROIs and to model surface, and left and right hippocampi were segmented on each subject. The shape differences between groups were evaluated by a multivariate F-test performed on each vertex separately. Only differences surviving correction for multiple comparison (FDR), with a statistical threshold of P .05, were considered. Shape-analysis findings were represented by a 3D image of the structures in which a colorimetric scale (representing the F-value) highlighted significant differences. Red areas corresponded to regions with no significant shape differences. VBM Data Processing and Analysis Data were processed and examined by using the SPM8 software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), and we applied VBM implemented in the VBM8 toolbox with default parameters, incorporating the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (SPM5) toolbox, which was used to obtain a high-dimensional normalization protocol. Images were bias-corrected, tissue-classified, registered, modulated, and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8-mm full width at half maximum. The gray matter volume maps were statistically analyzed by using the general linear model based on Gaussian random field theory. We investigated the presence of volumetric changes between groups by using analysis of covariance, including age and total intracranial volume as covariates of no interest. Because the Hh group was significantly older with respect to the non-Hh group (t 2.95; P value .005), to exclude possible spurious effects depending on age, we re-ran our analysis, splitting the group without Hh into 2 cohorts: the younger (including all subjects from 20 to 39 years of age [n 21]; mean age, 30.1 5.2 years; 12 women) and the older (including subjects from 39 to 60 years [n 13]; mean age, 47.7 7.4; 7 women) groups. Statistical analysis was performed within and outside ROIs including the bilateral hippocampi and the parahippocampal gyrus. The statistical threshold was set at P .05, with FDR correction for multiple comparisons within ROIs. We reported other brain regions that were not predicted a priori but met a wholebrain statistical threshold FDR .05. Automated Hippocampal Volumetry To corroborate shape and voxel-based findings, we further performed automated labeling and quantification of hippocampal volume by using FreeSurfer 5.0. The automated procedures for volumetric measures of several deep GM structures have been previously described. This procedure automatically provided segments and labels for up to 40 unique structures and assigned a neuroanatomic label to each voxel in an MR imaging volume based on probabilistic information estimated automatically from a manually labeled training set. The automated subcortical segmentation performed by FreeSurfer required these steps: First, an optimal linear transform is computed that maximizes the likelihood of the input image, given an atlas constructed from manually labeled images. A nonlinear transform is then initialized with the linear one, and the image is allowed to further deform to better match the atlas. Finally, a Bayesian segmentation procedure is performed, and the maximum a posteriori estimate of the labeling is computed. This approach provides advantages similar to those of manual ROI drawing, without the potential for rater bias, offering an anatomically accurate rendering of regional volumes. Total intracranial volume was calculated and was used to correct the regional brain volume measurements. Normalized hippocampal values were calculated as follows: [raw hippocampal volume/total intracranial volume] 1000. Statistical Analysis Categoric variables are expressed as frequency and percentages, and the differences among groups in the hippocampal volumetry were assessed by using an unpaired t test. To evaluate the agreement between 2 readers and the agreement between 2 different measurements, we calculated the Cohen coefficient and used the Wald statistic to test the null hypothesis that is equal to zero. Statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Package for Social Science software (Version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois) for Windows.

Several putative driver organisms enriched on CRCs have been identified from human studies, but few data exist which properly account for important clinical variables in CRC. In this study, we used a meta-taxonomic approach to demonstrate how the CRC microbiome varies with disease stage, histological markers of prognosis and host molecular phenotypes. Method A prospective study was performed on patients undergoing colonoscopy and elective surgery for CRC at three hospitals in UK and Czech Republic. Tissue was sampled from tumours, adenomas, adjacent normal mucosa and mucosa from healthy colon controls. The V1-2 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced (Illumina MiSeq); data were processed in Mothur and analysed in Stamp and R. Species assignment was performed with NCBI BLAST for microbial genomes. False discovery rate p value correction accounted for multiple testing. Histological analysis and tumour molecular phenotyping were performed according to Royal College of Pathology guidelines. Results One hundred and ninety six patients were recruited: 158 CRC patients, 24 adenoma patients and 14 normal colon controls (median age 70; range 35â€“90). Tumours were staged as 6â€‰T0, 4â€‰T1, 23â€‰T2, 97â€‰T3, 27â€‰T4; 99â€‰N0, 40â€‰N1, 27â€‰N2; 6â€‰M1. No significant differences were seen in diversity or taxonomy between the UK and Czech cohorts. Adenoma and healthy colon control samples were taxonomically indistinct. However, CRCs were characterised by reduced Shannon diversity (p<0.01), with enrichment of organisms including Bacteroides fragilis,Fusobacterium nucleatum and under-representation of Bacteroides vulgatus,Bacteroides uniformisandFaecalibacterium prausnitzii (all q<0.01). Furthermore, we found a significant progressive reduction in the expression of Bacteroides vulgatus with advancing T stage and a corresponding increase in Fusobacterium nucleatum expression (figure). Additionaly, samples from patients with T4 tumours and cancers expressing histological and molecular markers of poor prognosis were characterised by enrichment of certain low abundance oral pathobionts: Parvimonas micra,Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella spp. Conclusion This large prospective analysis demonstrates that the CRC microbiome is stage-specific and appears to evolve with disease progression. We conclude that oral pathobionts which colonise advanced stage disease relate to markers of tumour prognosis, raising the possibility that they may be directly influencing tumour invasion.

In this study we evaluate previously identified gene and lifestyle interactions in a candidate pathway that were associated with colon cancer risk to see if these interactions altered gene expression. We analyzed non-tumor RNA-seq data from 144 colon cancer patients who had genotype, recent cigarette smoking, diet, body mass index (BMI), and recent aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use data. Using a false discovery rate of 0.1, we evaluated differential gene expression between high and low levels of lifestyle exposure and genotypes using DESeq2. Thirteen pathway genes and 17 SNPs within those genes were associated with altered expression of other genes in the pathway. BMI, NSAIDs use and dietary components of the oxidative balance score (OBS) also were associated with altered gene expression. SNPs previously identified as interacting with these lifestyle factors, altered expression of pathway genes. NSAIDs interacted with 10 genes (15 SNPs) within those genes to alter expression of 28 pathway genes; recent cigarette smoking interacted with seven genes (nine SNPs) to alter expression of 27 genes. BMI interacted with FLT1, KDR, SEPN1, TERT, TXNRD2, and VEGFA to alter expression of eight genes. Three genes (five SNPs) interacted with OBS to alter expression of 12 genes. These data provide support for previously identified lifestyle and gene interactions associated with colon cancer in that they altered expression of key pathway genes.

f9fa87f7faa50720113472da2fc74729c037d3f5,Changes in the gene expression profiles of the brains of male European eels (Anguilla anguilla) during sexual maturation,"BackgroundThe vertebrate brain plays a critical role in the regulation of sexual maturation and reproduction by integrating environmental information with developmental and endocrine status. The European eel Anguilla anguilla is an important species in which to better understand the neuroendocrine factors that control reproduction because it is an endangered species, has a complex life cycle that includes two extreme long distance migrations with both freshwater and seawater stages and because it occupies a key position within the teleost phylogeny. At present, mature eels have never been caught in the wild and little is known about most aspects of reproduction in A. anguilla. The goal of this study was to identify genes that may be involved in sexual maturation in experimentally matured eels. For this, we used microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles of sexually mature to immature males.ResultsUsing a false discovery rate of 0.05, a total of 1,497 differentially expressed genes were identified. Of this set, 991 were expressed at higher levels in brains (forebrain and midbrain) of mature males while 506 were expressed at lower levels relative to brains of immature males. The set of up-regulated genes includes genes involved in neuroendocrine processes, cell-cell signaling, neurogenesis and development. Interestingly, while genes involved in immune system function were down-regulated in the brains of mature males, changes in the expression levels of several receptors and channels were observed suggesting that some rewiring is occurring in the brain at sexual maturity.ConclusionsThis study shows that the brains of eels undergo major changes at the molecular level at sexual maturity that may include re-organization at the cellular level. Here, we have defined a set of genes that help to understand the molecular mechanisms controlling reproduction in eels. Some of these genes have previously described functions while many others have roles that have yet to be characterized in a reproductive context. Since most of the genes examined here have orthologs in other vertebrates, the results of this study will contribute to the body of knowledge concerning reproduction in vertebrates as well as to an improved understanding of eel biology.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Allison M.

Previous power results for this procedure have been based on simulations. This article produces theoretical expressions for expected power. To derive them, we make assumptions about the number of hypotheses being tested, which null hypotheses are true, which are false, and the distributions of the test statistics under each null and alternative. We use these assumptions to derive bounds for multiple dimensional rejection regions. With these bounds and a permanent based representation of the joint density function of the largest p-values, we use the law of total probability to derive the distribution of the total number of rejections. We derive the joint distribution of the total number of rejections and the number of rejections when the null hypothesis is true.

3cfa14f66a8536654a62ef0f306091911d95670f,Comparing Different Statistical Models and Multiple Testing Corrections for Association Mapping in Soybean and Maize,"Association mapping (AM) is a powerful tool for fine mapping complex trait variation down to nucleotide sequences by exploiting historical recombination events. A major problem in AM is controlling false positives that can arise from population structure and family relatedness. False positives are often controlled by incorporating covariates for structure and kinship in mixed linear models (MLM). These MLM-based methods are single locus models and can introduce false negatives due to over fitting of the model. In this study, eight different statistical models, ranging from single-locus to multilocus, were compared for AM for three traits differing in heritability in two crop species: soybean (Glycine max L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). Soybean and maize were chosen, in part, due to their highly differentiated rate of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay, which can influence false positive and false negative rates. The fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU) performed better than other models based on an analysis of Q-Q plots and on the identification of the known number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in a simulated data set. These results indicate that the FarmCPU controls both false positives and false negatives. Six qualitative traits in soybean with known published genomic positions were also used to compare these models, and results indicated that the FarmCPU consistently identified a single highly significant SNP closest to these known published genes. Multiple comparison adjustments (Bonferroni, false discovery rate, and positive false discovery rate) were compared for these models using a simulated trait having 60% heritability and 20 QTLs. Multiple comparison adjustments were overly conservative for MLM, CMLM, ECMLM, and MLMM and did not find any significant markers; in contrast, ANOVA, GLM, and SUPER models found an excessive number of markers, far more than 20 QTLs.

Genetic risk factors are believed to combine with environmental exposures and contribute to the risk of developing temporomandibular disorder (TMD). In this prospective cohort study, 2,737 people without TMD were assessed for common genetic variation in 358 genes known to contribute to nociceptive pathways, inflammation, and affective distress. During a median follow-up period of 2.8 years, 260 people developed first-onset TMD. Hazard ratios were computed as measures of association between 2,924 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and TMD incidence. After correction for multiple testing, no single single-nucleotide polymorphism was significantly associated with risk of onset TMD. However, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms exceeded Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison or false discovery rate thresholds (.05, .1, or .2) for association with intermediate phenotypes shown to be predictive of TMD onset. Nonspecific orofacial symptoms were associated with voltage-gated sodium channel, type I, alpha subunit (SCN1A, rs6432860, P = 2.77 Ã— 10(-5)) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, rs1514280, P = 4.86 Ã— 10(-5)); global psychological symptoms with prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1, rs3842803, P = 2.79 Ã— 10(-6)); stress and negative affectivity with amyloid-Î² (A4) precursor protein (APP, rs466448, P = 4.29 Ã— 10(-5)); and heat pain temporal summation with multiple PDZ domain protein (MPDZ, rs10809907, P = 3.05 Ã— 10(-5)). The use of intermediate phenotypes for complex pain diseases revealed new genetic pathways influencing risk of TMD.

9c5c799feeda77bdbee1e654e87542bbeb60a677,"Association analysis of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 and the glutamine synthetase genes (GAD2, GLUL) with schizophrenia.","OBJECTIVE
As dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission is one of the plausible hypotheses for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, genes involved in the glutamate neurotransmitter system are candidates for schizophrenia susceptibility. The aim of this study is to clarify the contribution of two genes encoding glutamate metabolic enzymes: the glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 gene (GAD2) and the glutamine synthetase gene (GLUL), in schizophrenia.


METHODS
We genotyped 300 Japanese schizophrenia patients and 300 healthy controls for 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GAD2 (approximately 91 kb in size) and six SNPs in GLUL (approximately 14 kb in size). We examined 'single-point' association as well as pairwise haplotype association for all SNPs with schizophrenia.


RESULTS
We observed no significant 'single-point' associations with the disease in any of the 20 SNPs after correction for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate. We also observed no significant haplotype associations with False Discovery Rate. Furthermore, we analyzed gene-gene interactions, including six glutamate receptor genes we have reported previously in the association studies of GRIA4, GRIN2D, GRIK3, GRIK4, GRIK5, and GRM3, using the multifactor dimensionality reduction method. The best interaction model, however, did not show the statistical significance.


CONCLUSION
These results suggest that GAD2 and GLUL do not play a major role in schizophrenia pathogenesis and there is no gene-gene interaction between the eight genes in the Japanese population.",2009,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Shinsaku Arai"", ids = ""46805127""); list(name = ""Hiroki Shibata"", ids = ""2981383""); list(name = ""Mayumi Sakai"", ids = ""47991121""); list(name = ""Hideaki Ninomiya"", ids = ""35215264""); list(name = ""Nakao Iwata"", ids = ""4288013""); list(name = ""Norio Ozaki"", ids = ""143653653""); list(name = ""Yasuyuki Fukumaki"", ids = ""6193051"")",d4490b51fd6e7f525a435c8de32a6225de8ab6a7; 61c20eb802582c52f08c2a6c1115abb92316c457; 4763525c8fa84a8e2f24b67855fb0837d416262a; 10bde2c7fd4500e7f714fb99aa3212ab35d5c5d2; 2d3c0a90913f479d805bff282f39ccaddffd9ef9; bf76d18a522fc519d6d5f3b20db0a53290139129; bf87f1743ec6bab186fa46b42567cf8a03a461ea; de6f38505fe6a81dd76293c30a6eeb7247136a65,18e286c0c255570753714770ae3403250c6e9fa6; 51d1f2bca885dd52fb9d5d5b6b136d971e28f000; 2b0947903f24f93281ba80da53fc325c77089e83; 9ae0fd91a0d0c707d9938adc852bb611c41f413e; 527b983c7ff4092f457c7f647709d62b1747a4fe; 6ade27866b3adb5ec898bca9cb5a8295da3fb8f6; 56083c37a4cb00588785b41bb4c1fc64f0869ff5; 0ff806eb7349ff5e4781f9cbcdea3a7f8e3b7f1b; 9f84b23773780547812964728aa77b2c6edb40d2; 0f40a6dbd08cf88949e43542c4f6092cf66ff44c; 746f4fb16d31df1183dd1c263a6f0b3be494b40f; 107646499f53decbad519bcce4fb252b1b0c8750; 0aad587d2e19cb8f3d1416d7be0220e8da3f8426; b15365c3e828158e05ce27ec08d90456413057e2; f0f47deb5639fb8749c432365f6d44da0e7265ba; b0cb46fa717308efbef1c8f1b530d1516650e38f; 81891c8605f998c3893273d8506349eac7295dc4; 0502aef19b37a01be9cecaa0500b92e127c51a55; bc62eed4b20aa4f17e3f8cd56abc3ebb5f042384; 4ceeac0b16ddd53e003265749615f6d50c06eca0; bad6ce01b8db12620f42ef29329668507d9c7dc4; 40c99296355beabff9019f54b64da6bd38c8dcdd; a83ef53020111b5346c21c47356173595270d029; f3f574ba5baf1fac65463984749bdba6b6d00388; a35b4a23e525e48a4df6b546470930041737da1e; 3c45cac97bd33bc04ec03aa96c5f3303274d641e; 6e46e2ca0f41cff40007205994e64d0451dc77f6; 111d82e2add3ff0dea32941b405ce0f54dda53d6; e6c6a9d975b9e84e2bcf01941e2aed9c6f26b2ae; 907ddb3a08dcb77f0057ff15b67e9361c2f576b7; e3abc33685260b717d4ec73df312b115a0b865d7; 279e0f13e917cdf076f29082e00a91c057768ff8; 8c4620edb258b27fa8dec0b2a636b345f1a75a0b; 2271fa9ba3f0d918b8edcdc5812342d563e3e761; 721268ea924df18f5a262d1974479f00623f6370; a184e43ec4fb8a2ad52b023ffcfcb78280fdf644; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; 43f13f760c734063e1cd43e79237e095f2ad4e66,Psychiatric genetics,19 1,"

We describe a method to evaluate the accuracy of these algorithms based on the masses of parent proteins before trypsin endoprotease digestion. Measurement of conformance to parent proteins provides a score for comparison of the performances of different algorithms as well as alternative parameter settings for a given algorithm. Tracking of conformance scores for spectrum matches to proteins with progressively lower expression levels revealed that conformance scores are not uniform within data sets but are significantly lower for less abundant proteins. Similarly peptides with lower algorithm peptide-spectrum match scores have lower conformance. Although peptide mass spectrometry data is typically filtered through decoy analysis to ensure a low false discovery rate, this analysis confirms that the filtered data should not be considered as having a uniform confidence. The analysis suggests that use of different algorithms and multiple standardized parameter settings of these algorithms can increase significantly the numbers of peptides identified.

fdf470e81c1d042d1a41b9fa7e1207e5bcd2fc89,Bone metastasis-related signaling pathways in breast cancers stratified by estrogen receptor status,"Background: Breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM)-specific genes have been reported without considering biological differences based on estrogen receptor (ER) status. The aims of this study were to identify BCBM-specific genes using our patient dataset and validate previously reported BCBM-specific genes, and to determine whether ER-status-related biological differences matter in identification of BCBM-specific genes. Methods: We used Affymetrix GeneChips to analyze 365 primary human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative invasive breast cancer specimens. Genes that were differentially expressed between patients who developed bone metastasis and those who developed non-bone metastasis were identified using Cox proportional hazards model, and differential expression of gene sets was assessed using gene set analysis. We performed gene set analysis to determine whether biological function associated with bone metastasis were different by ER status using 2,246 functionally annotated gene sets assembled from Gene Ontology data base. Results: Among 16,712 probe sets, 592 were overexpressed in the bone metastasis cohort compared to the non-bone-metastasis cohort (false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05). However, no BCBM-specific genes met our significance tests when the cancers were stratified by ER status. In ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers, 151 and 125 gene sets, respectively, were overexpressed for BCBM and the majority of BCBM-related pathways were different. Of significant gene sets, only 13 gene sets were overlapped between ER-positive and -negative cohorts. Conclusion: ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers have different biological pathways in BCBM development. We have yet to explore BCBM-related biomarkers and targets considering the biological features associated with BCBM depending on the ER status.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Naoki Hayashi"", ids = ""46295768""); list(name = ""Takayuki Iwamoto"", ids = ""2222964""); list(name = ""Yuan Qi"", ids = ""40612590""); list(name = ""Naoki Niikura"", ids = ""6790506""); list(name = ""Libero Santarpia"", ids = ""3778342""); list(name = ""Hideko Yamauchi"", ids = ""7346922""); list(name = ""Seigo Nakamura"", ids = ""22800251""); list(name = ""Gabriel N.

58f100fb4c36fe115fbc7a9cbb6ba2dfba9c6c3d,Abstract 3393: Identification of genes mediating early dissemination of tumor cells in breast cancer,"The presence of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow (BM) at primary breast cancer diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor. We have recently shown that there is a specific gene expression signature associated with BM micrometastasis in lung cancer patients (Wrage et al., CCR 2009). Our aim was therefore, to assess whether early metastatic spread of breast tumor cells into BM is also associated with a specific genetic signature. The gene expression profiles of primary early stage breast cancer patients (T1-2, N0, M0) with (n=15) and without (n=15) early tumor cell dissemination into BM were analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip platform. The BM status was assessed by immunostaining the BM samples with anti-cytokeratin antibody A45-B/B3. Gene expression data were normalized using gcrma and customized chip description files were used to re-map all probes to ENSEMBL transcripts. Rank sum test analysis was used to obtain transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed between BM positive and BM negative patients. Five publicly available breast cancer and three lung cancer expression data sets were used to correlate the findings with survival information. When using false discovery rate of 0.2 and a p-value The five large breast cancer data sets consisting of 1621 patients in total were used for in silico validations. Among the down-regulated genes 17 showed a significant association with survival in at least one data set, whereas 6 genes showed an association in at least two data sets. Among the four up-regulated genes a high expression of one gene was associated with shorter survival in two data sets whereas another gene was associated with shorter survival in one data set. In summary, we could identify a set of potential key regulators of early hematogeneous spread of tumor cells. These potential new targets might be used to prevent metastatic relapse by eliminating DTC before the occurrence of overt metastases. Some of the identified genes are supposed to play a role only for the early steps of the metastatic cascade, i.e. dissemination, whereas others were shown also to be important for metastatic out-growth in distant organs and thus having a high impact on the survival of a patient.

a7154f4d220692f1f5346959c5beebcbab7ba10c,An evaluation of methods correcting for cell type heterogeneity in DNA methylation studies,"Background Many different methods exist to adjust for variability in cell-type mixture proportions when analysing DNA methylation studies. Here we present the result of an extensive simulation study, built on cell-separated DNA methylation profiles from Illumina Infinium 450K methylation data, to compare the performance of 8 methods including the most commonly-used approaches. Results We designed a rich multi-layered simulation containing a set of probes with true associations with either binary or continuous phenotypes, confounding by cell type, variability in means and standard deviations for population parameters, additional variability at the level of an individual cell-type-specific sample, and variability in the mixture proportions across samples. Performance varied quite substantially across methods and simulations. In particular, the false discovery rates (FDR) were sometimes unrealistically high, indicating limited ability to discriminate the true signals from those appearing significant through confounding. Methods that filtered probes had consequently poor power. QQ-plots of p-values across all tested probes showed that adjustments did not always improve the distribution. The same methods were used to examine associations between smoking and methylation data from a case-control study of colorectal cancer. Conclusions We recommend surrogate variable analysis for cell-type mixture adjustment since performance was stable under all our simulated scenarios.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Kevin McGregor"", ids = ""33244708""); list(name = ""Sasha Bernatsky"", ids = ""144885295""); list(name = ""InÃ©s Colmegna"", ids = ""3379388""); list(name = ""Marie Hudson"", ids = ""66205724""); list(name = ""Tomi Pastinen"", ids = ""48977994""); list(name = ""AurÃ©lie Labbe"", ids = ""144161892""); list(name = ""Celia M.

4ed64f6abc972ba3e3e186b05a495025f50c3c4d,Circulating Progenitor Cell Count Predicts Microvascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetic Patients.,"CONTEXT
Diabetes reduces the levels of circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which promote vascular repair and are inversely correlated with cardiovascular risk.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study was to test whether CPC/EPC levels predict onset/progression of microangiopathy in a cohort of type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients.


DESIGN
This was a pseudoprospective study with a 3.9-year follow-up.


SETTING
The study was conducted at a tertial referral diabetes outpatient clinic.


PATIENTS
A total of 187 T2D patients having a baseline determination of CPCs/EPCs participated in the study.


INTERVENTION
Baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, concomitant risk factors, diabetic complications, and medications were collected.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Onset or progression of microangiopathy was assessed at follow-up compared with baseline.


RESULTS
New onset or progression of microalbuminuria, chronic kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy occurred in 70 patients (9.5%/y). After controlling the false discovery rate, baseline CD34(+) CPCs and EPCs were significantly lower in patients with onset/progression of microalbuminuria and any microangiopathy. Patients with baseline CD34(+) CPC or CD133(+)/kinase insert domain-containing receptor(+)/EPC levels below the median were more likely to experience worsening microangiopathy than those with high cell levels. Independently from confounders, including age, sex, glycated hemoglobin, and diabetes duration, CD34(+) cells predicted onset/progression of microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and any microangiopathy in false discovery rate-adjusted analyses. A low CD34(+) cell count limited the beneficial effects of renin-angiotensin system blockers on microalbuminuria progression.

119d38d87cd2f46501915905410105cf4ca77a3e,Abstract 109: DNA methylation profiling associated with recurrence of prostate cancer,"DNA methylation profiles could signify the risk of prostate cancer and predict the progression of cancer before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Specific CpG sites methylation of genes identified in our study could be used to improve the sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis and to predict the risk of prostate cancer recurrence. To identify methylation changes associated with prostate cancer, we measured gene methylation using the Infinium Human Methylation27 bead chips. Tissue DNA isolation and bisulfite conversion was done using ZR Genomic DNA kit and EZ methylation kit. The methylation27 microarrays was used to analyze methylation of 27,578 CpG sites of 14,495 genes in 198 tumor tissues and 40 matched normal tissues. Methylation data was processed using the Genome Studio software, differentially methylated genes identified using one-way analysis of variance, and correction for multiple testing done using the false discovery rate q-value. To identify putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers we performed four subgroup comparisons: tumor vs. matched normal, recurrent tumors vs. non-recurrent tumors, clinical recurrence vs. biochemical recurrence, and systemic recurrence vs. local recurrence. Clinicopathological and molecular features including patient preoperative PSA levels, Gelason score, TNM stage, GPSM, recurrence type, were also evaluated for subgroup discrimination. Discriminative subgroup candidate methlyation markers were selected using a p value 0.05. Between the tumor and matched normal tissue samples, 164 CpG sites representing 147 genes were identified as significantly differentially methylated (p 2.0). Between recurrent tumor and non-recurrent tumor tissues there were 78 CpG sites representing 75 genes that were significantly differentially methylated (p 1.5). Between clinically recurrent and biochemically recurrent tumors, 16 CpG sites representing 16 genes were significantly differentially methylated (p 1.5). Between systemic recurrent and local recurrent tumors there were 73 CpG sites representing 68 genes that were significantly differentially methylated (p 1.5) Our analysis revealed differential methylation of the genes, implicating their role in prostate cancer development and progression. We demonstrated that the hypermethylation of genes could be used as a sensitive molecular tool in detection of prostate tumorigenesis and prediction of tumor progression.

c469bb78be85b9b0588048ceb6283630b7d26ad7,Identification of novel biomarkers for preeclampsia on the basis of differential expression network analysis,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a severe pregnancy complication, which is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality. The present study aimed to screen potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of PE and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of PE development based on the differential expression network (DEN). The microarray datasets E-GEOD-6573 and E-GEOD-48424 were downloaded from the European Bioinformatics Institute database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the PE and normal groups were screened by Significant Analysis of Microarrays with the cutoff value of a |log2 fold change| of >2, and a false discovery rate of <0.05. The DEN was constructed based on the differential and non-differential interactions observed. In addition, genes with higher connectivity degrees in the DEN were identified on the basis of centrality analysis, while disease genes were also extracted from the DEN. In order to understand the functional roles of genes in DEN, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The present results indicated that a total of 225 genes were considered as DEGs in the PE group, while 466 nodes and 314 gene interactions were involved in the DEN. Among these 466 nodes, 4 nodes with higher degrees were identified, including ubiquitin C (UBC), small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1), SUMO2 and RAD21 homolog (S. pombe) (RAD21). Notably, UBC was also found to be a disease gene. UBC, RAD21, SUMO2 and SUMO1 were markedly enriched in the regulation of programmed cell death, as well as in the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle and chromosomal part. In conclusion, based on these results, we suggest that UBC, RAD21, SUMO2 and SUMO1 may be reliable biomarkers for the prediction of the development and progression of PE.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yufang Wu"", ids = ""48608205""); list(name = ""Xiuhua Fu"", ids = ""12442617""); list(name = ""Lin Wang"", ids = ""49680956"")",c5c6a52783238c8828b343a544b01205cea48c6e,b47a55f5184e2a5d564e8031567e5de534fd0789; 7f1eca3bf2489f42f8d9ad3012ed829667931f2f; 35157dba9977fe0969aaf8e45b87fd9727272bf6; db25ce433815a903ede9ed32e8ee6e12510f90b7; a9cb75827fdb95d175b455db8b44daf6d7f835a1; a66fd5a19b687bcb39c5131a1619fa04ee5e785e; d2860a370a0386c57fecc4eef2e43779352fa410; 5b96795c1851f6fc13d0605883555814bc42ff24; c5d72087273089c6d8e75281d587c9b6ab1e8675; b81cf4f4ad03dd4a6671dda488355b7da028225a; fb7cdd6bc35cb989b5093fdb36d7d386db22fe89; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 6d88e68e6e106aeb6c767f7fdb13653334a44ea1; 7555e48b809749c1ecd56d29d2f865d2b66c5492; 2fe4aff836d6621bf1e799c70741bf68e4359ddc; aa0e29e35a7fb23ce5f28ce1ce2d5eba2ad42e75; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 047bd5557e28d17cedb8f354a39a61c88f1f28ab; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 14e3f6aaef143307fcdb321c1772f809946f16e0; ee385b7df38f7566928503cff3af4f49beb23ce8; a07e490027ff4c6fc0953a8e3608a9baa0981bb7; a8683efa7a7f3d6c4ce6f31dad9e0b6aa9fed8f9; 272a9fae1241c506b4c2d579b0b0eb4bf677224f; 14ef8567bf0317a1fd483cc07ee639eb394e782e; 2f79ccf6d4a8cdb1c82eebe5fcdea141ccc2044a; b6d5f734dcb1483fdaa68942391d08cd9c188a09; 19b304f4414b00f3190169b07e44e0a3817da20c; 6bc8d9e5f1767667c03f669e90ada89e05212d7c; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 5fdbaa15dce076a56785fea347de34fca8ba3f88; 5e49e7a0a6c6d46a368a4c036bc9e89a0ac4edd5; 95cdf3e31f3b64a59a577fe3220f1b0c4a3ad063; 1437de36f7ef157fec1d2a15cdaee07bfc15f925; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 5b9814a364218cfd06334ea65764553e51e97023; cc370de59aef0bcb7dd197e3a088bd553ae8fe45; 0904e67e5de1320a44d4486c8c5b850828b808a5; 11f922fb4c831a1c71c6f7481fb75224afceb941; d75f0052b00e637da486b615affcc39d6896cf74; d59d49bf11d38649d1f6f04ec45913608d2a0023; 2dab8d1308ce1aac54767fdc644f5b1ccf3877a8; 42344bccd00a4d690aba9672a9dff76ccd153fc9; 564820b40774edf6254bb59cdd5b26d069494b94; 5dc9863cf2dc8daf8cdc8e7c3c7cbce562a98eab,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,12,201 - 207
473b41b81b942ba295d40d34103e3c8e6eb83416,A direct approach to false discovery rates by decoy permutations,"The current approaches to false discovery rates (FDRs) in multiple hypothesis testing are usually based on the null distribution of a test statistic. However, all types of null distributions, including the theoretical, permutation-based and empirical ones, have some inherent drawbacks. For example, the theoretical null might fail because of improper assumptions on the sample distribution. In addition, many existing approaches to FDRs need to estimate the ratio of true null hypotheses, which is difficult and unsatisfactorily addressed. In this paper, we propose the \emph{target-decoy procedure}, a different approach to FDRs for search of random variables different between cases and controls in general case-control study. Our approach is free of estimation of the null distribution and the ratio of true null hypotheses. The target-decoy procedure simply builds on the ordering of hypotheses by some statistic, and directly estimates the false target discoveries using the competing decoy hypotheses constructed by permutation. We prove that this approach can control the FDR. Simulation demonstrates that it is more stable and powerful than two most popular approaches. We also evaluate our approach on a real microarray data for identifying differential gene expression.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Kun He"", ids = ""145905331""); list(name = ""Mengjie Li"", ids = ""50651409""); list(name = ""Yan Fu"", ids = ""145817032""); list(name = ""Fuzhou Gong"", ids = ""3231787""); list(name = ""Xiaoming Sun"", ids = ""48305388"")",ddaf6284223414a2604c141c3d22c7d322f001fb; 3da8f768598ae726b128fc9d9474e286d61cd9d2; 84bf48112cac6b9fa7ad8fc4650b556abf7d13ab; 6be22dab1cedf4e9d421ce6371ede3af69e0d87b; 31f5d9a32cf2eecdefa9692b915cbc4f4ea4c5d7,e0a6e9054f97a6ab8592052460b4b84297233e99; 43a4585394e4cb50c365483291a8778b9b29dbda; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 4e71a14c028fdcc9a1af98d769c5568b57e38e1e; 918f6216cf0c7e95825737fdef804cba610d0785; 76f667df49db0e5a3a2f4fdd45995a120d3a6c32; 8db1313cfce4a340539b76d8e816d8f87dd66f49; 914ae0d35a987f60f6db4c96107c2ad83370ae8e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; bd1233f3707a76684f8801741de78b4bf879f643; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; a97e8af759381536766a5c2dfcb611fa0066c93c; e9fc973dd66ce985fabdcfa6b24493480f08149c; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; c1dc19f87fa83b4357f0557cbb6c32a4ee0002d7; 6cba8b457ea7520357ade5d24d393004d36765f6; 898639280e5a418911d4ba47be552f89dd67296b; 3eeb4ebf8df49c48c779ebbdc7878290f21e56ca; 1b13f5232b7728811fc42789098e23d669380047; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 6f7c4b5dba6e92339fae4c92ceb81d93c191b4bc; 4a3fdd481386f7f61481af8822254cb90ded0f66; 0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 0cc325ee022c258b30da3247a60828f7adf4d14c; fb825a04d32511d4d26372dab63b458e65245010; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 6798f8080d5a675a5ff091847bb39ceac6198a79; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; cfb5d59d9adb59f42cb1a29a319fe6afec218027; ae829b7fbf9f132a020420ded85e5d82de7ace64; 4f2b48d49c81233aba44396af5b9848f04ed283d; 4f8d68225928d63c547a4c506a6d621059e8b693; f61ddea561659e773ac88569719f84f0facf3009; 6a17464d5452d257cba944342e067b49228bdaaa; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; 02b9b415579468124b96142059a3939262c8cb53,arXiv: Methodology,,

Nevertheless, the inter-gender variations in the AH proteome are unknown. Therefore, this study endeavoured to characterize the AH proteome to assess the differences between genders. Thirty AH samples of patients who underwent cataract surgery were categorized according to their gender. Label-free quantitative discovery mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy was employed to characterize the AH proteome. A total of 147 proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of less than 1% and only the top 10 major AH proteins make up almost 90% of the total identified proteins. A large number of proteins identified were correlated to defence, immune and inflammatory mechanisms, and response to wounding. Four proteins were found to be differentially abundant between the genders, comprising SERPINF1, SERPINA3, SERPING1 and PTGDS. The findings emerging from our study provide the first insight into the gender-based proteome differences in the AH and also highlight the importance in considering potential sex-dependent changes in the proteome of ocular pathologies in future studies employing the AH.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Natarajan Perumal"", ids = ""4420767""); list(name = ""Caroline Manicam"", ids = ""6921575""); list(name = ""Matthias Steinicke"", ids = ""9606195""); list(name = ""Sebastian Funke"", ids = ""1991540""); list(name = ""Norbert Pfeiffer"", ids = ""144229180""); list(name = ""Franz H.

accb95f0a69e045d25f2b55df045c4b0dd4985fe,A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Estimating the Statistical Significance of Proteoform Identifications by Top-Down Mass Spectrometry.,"Top-down mass spectrometry is capable of identifying whole proteoform sequences with multiple post-translational modifications because it generates tandem mass spectra directly from intact proteoforms. Many software tools, such as ProSightPC, MSPathFinder, and TopMG, have been proposed for identifying proteoforms with modifications. In these tools, various methods are employed to estimate the statistical significance of identifications. However, most existing methods are designed for proteoform identifications without modifications, and the challenge remains for accurately estimating the statistical significance of proteoform identifications with modifications. Here we propose TopMCMC, a method that combines a Markov chain random walk algorithm and a greedy algorithm for assigning statistical significance to matches between spectra and protein sequences with variable modifications. Experimental results showed that TopMCMC achieved high accuracy in estimating E-values and false discovery rates of identifications in top-down mass spectrometry. Coupled with TopMG, TopMCMC identified more spectra than the generating function method from an MCF-7 top-down mass spectrometry data set.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qiang Kou"", ids = ""3382207""); list(name = ""Zhe Wang"", ids = ""47196788""); list(name = ""Rachele A.

6c6cc3345e8edfea9d3e80a77545d836ea89a2a8,A step-down method for correcting multiple hypothesis testing in biomedical signal processing,"Multiple hypothesis testing in biomedical signal analysis and genomic signal processing has been facing a difficult dilemma regarding the adjustment of significance values. Studies that report unadjusted values may fail to control false positives. On the other hand, classical correction methods may be too conservative while handling high-dimensional variable spaces, yielding a high Type II error rate. We present a novel stepwise method for estimating the adjusted p-values in applications that require multiple hypothesis testing. The method increases the statistical power of the results by refuting the assumption of independence among variables, while keeping the probability of false positives low. It is based on the spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix, from which it is possible to obtain valuable information about the dependence levels among the variables of the problem. The method is compared to other relevant stepwise adjustment models such as Holm's step-down extension of the Bonferroni/Sidak method, the False Discovery Rate method and resampling. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method in a magnetic resonance imaging study involving progressively larger sets of variables. The results show that the proposed method is able to compute adjusted p-values that are closer to the ones obtained by resampling, at a much lower computational cost.",2009,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Alexei Manso CorrÃªa Machado"", ids = ""1753472"")",,7d7c0a9af80691a5f23e01cf3db62d18d13b4d68; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; da618de550351682bbf2a100712ec8681e892191; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; f731b6745d829241941307c3ebf163e90e200318; 8327279f02a1a919b594704d5e8794734f61184e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 36d92d095a0136228595ae6e1f144ce87c9e4c69; e025e31a0a66e351243f954bda521b3a16f44f35; 7cdae9ece0e94ad740189e7b328bbf6993b4c8d5; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; c8fe0f42c1c823d41301fa60f23c4eb36319c6fc; 6756da5a0d5e037a0c143e6418b85633561c927c; a6014435240886cf5d29d75c5bdc1858e649653c; f4890345d1f0547606508185cf65d49613fbd423; e20b15ba1a0d141e5e814ca2667031c61dae5484; 44936b1253177be1e3774c0cae3cc1ee3634c3e5; 9706a2b9f3c6941ba0019458a9d1c1614dd755fc; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72,2009 16th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing,,1-6
835a5484292f32a3c02f507cbd8fb1f5d9f4aacf,The natural selection of bad science,"Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizingâ€”no deliberate cheating nor loafingâ€”by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more â€˜progeny,â€™ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration.

0aa56be70f08d9f5d9ed710322082da3a2b17199,Contribution of de novo non-coding mutations to autism and 1 identification of risk genes from whole-genome sequencing of affected 2 families 3 4 5,"46 47 Analyzing de novo mutations (DNMs) in protein-coding genes from whole-exome sequencing 48 (WES) data has emerged as a powerful tool for mapping risk genes of autism spectrum disorder 49 (ASD). The impact of non-coding mutations in ASD, however, has been largely unknown. This 50 represents a large gap in our understanding of the genetics of ASD, as the majority of GWAS hits 51 for a range of disorders fall into non-coding regions. To address this question, we performed a 52 meta-analysis of DNMs using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from more than 300 53 individuals with ASD. We found that DNMs are enriched within brain transcriptional regulatory 54 elements near genes involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. In these genes and in evolutionarily 55 constrained genes, we also found an excess of DNMs that are predicted to affect pre-mRNA 56 splicing. Collectively, we estimate that non-coding mutations explain at least one third of the ASD 57 genetic risk attributable to DNMs. By combining information of non-coding DNMs with published 58 WES data, we identified three new ASD risk genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1, and 11 59 at a FDR < 0.3. A number of these genes are known to regulate critical processes in neural 60 development and have been associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Taken together, our 61 results demonstrate the pathogenic contribution of non-coding DNMs in ASD etiology and 62 highlight some promising ASD risk genes. The analytic tools we provided in this study, for 63 estimating contribution of non-coding mutations to disease risk and for mapping susceptibility 64 genes using both coding and regulatory mutations, are applicable to any WGS studies on DNMs. 65 66 67",2016,,"list(name = ""Yuwen Liu"", ids = ""47910216""); list(name = ""Ercument Cicek"", ids = ""144522410""); list(name = ""Yanyu Liang"", ids = ""48504075""); list(name = ""Jinchen Li"", ids = ""36738204""); list(name = ""Rebecca A.

7f1d104d308c23653f44e9aaa65b0acc208adb44,IGF2BP1 Reverses Hemoglobin Switching in Adult Erythroblasts,"During human ontogeny, high-level transcription within the beta-globin gene cluster switches sequentially from embryonic-to-fetal-to-adult genes. Beta-thalassemias and sickle-cell disease are manifested by reduced or mutated expression of the adult-stage, beta-globin gene. Research is aimed toward the eventual therapeutic goal of safely preventing or reversing the fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switch among these patient populations. To identify genes that may be involved in regulation of the fetal-to-adult erythroid switch, purified CD34(+) cells from six umbilical cord (fetal) and six adult peripheral blood samples were cultured in serum-free medium, and gene expression libraries were prepared and sequenced from CD71(+), CD235a(+) erythroblast mRNA. In total, 546 million paired-end reads with a length of 101bp were generated for a comparison of cord and adult erythroblast transcriptomes. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19), and differential gene expression was identified [false discovery rate â‰¤ 0.05, fold change â‰¥ 1.5, and reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) â‰¥ 0.5]. A total of 145 genes were differentially expressed according to these criteria, with four of the top five encoding targets of the let-7 family of microRNAs. The topmost gene was insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), which is normally involved in transcriptome regulation and developmental timing. IGF2BP1 expression was 770-fold increased in the fetal erythroblasts (RPKM > 3.0) compared with low background levels in adult erythroblasts (RPKM A potential role for adult-stage IGF2BP1 over-expression (IGF2BP1-OE) in the regulation of globin genes and proteins was explored using lentiviral vectors designed for let-7 resistant, erythroid-specific expression of IGF2BP1 protein. IGF2BP1-OE transduced CD34(+) cells expressed the transgenic protein and maintained their ability to differentiate, accumulate hemoglobin, and enucleate ex vivo in the presence of erythropoietin. Globin mRNA and protein levels were investigated. While alpha-globin mRNA remained unchanged, gamma-globin mRNA became predominant [90% of (gamma + beta) mRNA] in IGF2BP1-OE samples [Control (empty vector) = 3.2E+06 Â± 8.2E+05 copies/ng; IGF2BP1-OE = 2.0E+07 Â± 5.9E+06 copies/ng; p Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2015,Biology,"list(name = ""Laxminath Tumburu"", ids = ""4363755""); list(name = ""Colleen Byrnes"", ids = ""144874470""); list(name = ""Y.

a51d482ada27fc62e169dc344a257110e2226c3d,Presence of meniscus tear alters gene expression profile of anterior cruciate ligament tears,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears occur in isolation or in tandem with other intra-articular injuries such as meniscus tears. The impact of injury pattern on the molecular biology of the injured ACL is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the biological response of the ACL to injury varies based on the presence or absence of concomitant meniscus tear. We performed RNA-seq on 28 ACL tears remnants (12 isolated, 16 combined). In total, 16,654 transcripts were differentially expressed between isolated and combined injury groups at false discovery rate of 0.05. Due to the large number of differentially expressed transcripts, we undertook an Ensembl approach to discover features that acted as hub genes that did not necessarily have large fold changes or high statistical significance, but instead had high biological significance. Our data revealed a negatively correlated module containing 5,960 transcripts (down-regulated in combined injury) and a positively correlated module containing 2,260 transcripts (up-regulated in combined injury). TNS1, MEF2D, NOTCH3, SOGA1, and MLXIP were highly-connected hub genes in the negatively correlated module and SCN2A, CSMD3, LRC44, USH2A, and LRP1B were critical hub genes in the positively correlated module. Transcripts in the negatively correlated module were associated with biological adhesion, actin-filament organization, cell junction assembly, and cell matrix adhesion. The positively correlated module transcripts were enriched for neuron migration and exocytosis regulation. These findings indicate genes and pathways reflective of healing deficiency and gain of neurogenic signaling in combined ACL and meniscus tears, suggesting their diminished repair potential. The biological response of ACL to injury could have implications for healing potential of the ligament and the long term health of the knee. Â© 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

2c8678a77b4fb892b864f1bb1f36a85108084c43,Protein-Level Statistical Analysis of Quantitative Label-Free Proteomics Data with ProStaR.,"ProStaR is a software tool dedicated to differential analysis in label-free quantitative proteomics. Practically, once biological samples have been analyzed by bottom-up mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the raw mass spectrometer outputs are processed by bioinformatics tools, so as to identify peptides and quantify them, by means of precursor ion chromatogram integration. Then, it is classical to use these peptide-level pieces of information to derive the identity and quantity of the sample proteins before proceeding with refined statistical processing at protein-level, so as to bring out proteins which abundance is significantly different between different groups of samples. To achieve this statistical step, it is possible to rely on ProStaR, which allows the user to (1) load correctly formatted data, (2) clean them by means of various filters, (3) normalize the sample batches, (4) impute the missing values, (5) perform null hypothesis significance testing, (6) check the well-calibration of the resulting p-values, (7) select a subset of differentially abundant proteins according to some false discovery rate, and (8) contextualize these selected proteins into the Gene Ontology.

59e20eec92fe395db1396f26719c9926df0a7c59,104 Characterisation Of The Proteome Of The Tendon Interfascicular Matrix,"Introduction Our previous work indicates that the interfascicular matrix (IFM) is critical for tendon function, facilitating sliding between fascicles to allow the tendon to stretch and recoil [Thorpe, 2012]. This is particularly important in energy storing tendons such as the human Achilles tendon and equine superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), which experience strains as high as 16% during exercise [Stephens, 1989], and therefore require the capacity for considerable inter-fascicular sliding. However, the composition of the IFM is poorly characterised, and little is known about which proteins within the IFM enable this sliding behaviour. Therefore, the aim of this study was isolate, characterise and compare the proteome of the IFM and fascicular matrix (FM) in the equine SDFT. We hypothesised that the proteomic profile would differ between the FM and the IFM, with greater complexity and turnover in the IFM. Methods Sections from the mid-metacarpal region of grossly normal SDFTs (n = 10) were embedded in OCT and snap-frozen. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate regions of the FM and IFM (Figure 1) from transverse cryosections. Following protein solubilisation and tryptic digestion, peptides were identified using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), using an Ultimate 3000 Nano system (Dionex/Thermo Fisher Scientific) on line to a Q Exactive Quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument (Thermo- Fisher Scientific). Proteins within the IFM and FM were identified using Peaks Â® 7 Spider software, searching against the UniHorse database, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%, a minimum of 2 peptides per protein and a confidence score > 50. Progenesisâ„¢ software was used to identify fold changes in protein abundance between the FM and IFM. Greater than 2 fold changes with FDR adjusted p values Results A total of 246 proteins were identified in the IFM, and 141 in the FM (significance score >50). 60 proteins showed a > 2 fold change between the FM and IFM. Of these, 48 proteins were enriched in the IFM, including collagen type III, histones and ribosomal proteins. 12 proteins were at lower abundance in the IFM, including type I collagen, thrombospondin-1 and 4, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and fibromodulin. Neopeptides for collagens type I, III, V, XI, COMP and decorin were identified in both FM and IFM samples. A greater number of collagen neopeptides were identified in the IFM than in the FM. Discussion This is the first work to provide a comprehensive analysis of proteins present within different regions of tendon. The data support our hypothesis, demonstrating a greater number of proteins within the IFM, and different levels of a large number of proteins between the FM and IFM. The higher levels of histones and ribosomal proteins are indicative of the greater cell number within the IFM. Despite lower abundance of collagens in the IFM, the greater number of collagen neopeptides identified in the IFM suggest the components of this matrix are turned over more rapidly than the FM. Further characterisation of the proteins within the IFM will provide a greater understanding of IFM and tendon function. Acknowledgements Funded by BBSRC References Stephens et al .

Squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the second most common type of NSCLC, making up about 30% of all cases. The average 5-year survival rate among NSCLC patients is barely 15% (Herbst et al., 2008). Among post-surgery patients, prognosis varies widely, even among patients with similar clinicopathological characteristics, demonstrating the need for improved ways to predict treatment outcomes (Chen et al., 2007). Previous global gene-expression studies have identified genes that could be referred to as signatures for classifying patients with significantly different prognostic outcomes. However, these studies generally analyzed NSCLC patients with mixed histopathologic subsets and some of them only focused on adenocarcinomas (ADC) or stage I disease (Potti et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Shedden et al., 2008; Tomida et al., 2009; Jeong et al., 2010; Kadara et al., 2011). Interestingly, each study identified different sets of gene signatures. This could reflect the genetic heterogeneity of NSCLC and thus suggests the necessity of stratifying the prognosis of lung cancer with respect to more accurate grouping information, such as stages, histopathologic subsets, or other demographic factors. Correspondingly, currently known NSCLC blood biomarkers are rare and of little use in the prediction of prognosis. For the purpose of patient-tailored therapeutics, we herein attempted to identify relapse-related signatures that allow the selection of late stage SCLC with a high probability of rapid relapse. By harnessing current powerful approaches in shotgun and targeted proteomics (based on selected reaction monitoring, SRM) (Huttenhain et al., 2009), we have succeeded in profiling the pre-therapy serum proteome of patients with an improved analysis depth. Moreover, we elaborated a directed approach to avoid possible confounding factors, such as clinical and pathological features that might complicate efforts to delineate relapse discrepancies. The triple non-invasive blood signatures discovered here may be promising for refining the prognosis of stage IIb and IIIa SCLC. Fifty patients with SCLC who had disease recurrence within 10 months (7.44 + 2.08 months) after surgery were selected and defined as the â€˜rapid recurrenceâ€™ group (RR group). Fifty-six patients who showed no evidence of recurrent disease (ND) .20 months (.27.04 + 5.73 months) post-surgery were defined as the ND group. To identify relapse-related blood proteins, all RR patients were selected with different genders, smoking history, metastasis symptoms, varied ages (from 41 to 73) and pathological features determined TNM stages and, therefore, may present fast relapse SCLC diseases with varied clinical and pathological features. Both RR and ND patients had either stage IIb or IIIa disease. All the ND patients under the same adjuvant-therapy and follow-up surveillance post-surgery were accordingly selected to match RR cases by gender, age, smoking habits and the exact pathological features determined TNM stage, except for a much better prognostic outcome (Figure 1A). A total of 106 patients were separated into two cohorts for this study: Cohort I, 30 pairs of RR/ND and Cohort II, 20RR/26ND. Patient demographics are summarized in Supplementary Table S1, with all clinicopathologic details listed in Supplementary Table S2. Five pairs of RR/ND samples in Cohort I were used and compared in the discovery phase (Figure 1B). Collectively, 711012 peptide hits from 4139 unique peptides, assigned to 595 protein groups, were credibly identified by shotgun proteomics with the final protein-level false discovery rate (FDR) ,1% in each pair. And 386â€“439 serum proteins were identified from each patient. The final peptide FDR for the whole data set was only 0.016%. By applying a label-free method termed localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) (Li et al., 2008; Luo et al., 2011), we identified 64â€“117 significantly up-regulated proteins and 70â€“108 downregulated proteins in RR cases compared with ND cases (P , 0.05, Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1). To distinguish the true protein abundance changes from random fluctuations, we used the following stringent criteria: (i) an LSPAD, P , 0.05 in all the five pairs; (ii) an average of P , 0.01; (iii) a fold-change of .1.3 between the RR and ND groups; and (iv) at least 20 MS/MS spectra had to be assigned to the candidate due to the sensitivity issue of spectral counting. Twenty-five proteins were thus identified as relapse-related signatures. Literature mining and biological interests then led us to focus on three proteinsâ€”C4b-binding protein alpha (C4BP), leucine-rich alpha-2glycoprotein (LRG1), and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) for the next phase of 344 | Journal of Molecular Cell Biology (2012), 4, 344â€“347 doi:10.1093/jmcb/mjs050",2012,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Yan-sheng Liu"", ids = ""7895599""); list(name = ""Xiao-yang Luo"", ids = ""13289676""); list(name = ""Qing-run Li"", ids = ""3994996""); list(name = ""Hong Li"", ids = ""46382206""); list(name = ""Chen Li"", ids = ""40144368""); list(name = ""Hong Wei Ni"", ids = ""46404689""); list(name = ""Rong-xia Li"", ids = ""2622438""); list(name = ""Rui Wang"", ids = ""48397438""); list(name = ""Hai-Chuan Hu"", ids = ""7150341""); list(name = ""Yamin Pan"", ids = ""153058066""); list(name = ""Hai-quan Chen"", ids = ""2828856""); list(name = ""Rong Zeng"", ids = ""145908217"")",dad698a6bb2808e356d051e6b1d56852a2590812; a344fe6160dd2236eb402c18be5cd3ee1e625d2c; 771d671a99a32f09acdfc144f4035d30db84ee9a; c8a381171e73112aec7b79b80ab3d00d735bd0ef; 7db69af9cedd7b9169e0bdae7722a0e36ca38037; a04e5d51183a4031fbe1a97746252ac1c64a8a7f; ebdb5ac6067e4b0780dac74e4f9a3e6b822b8281; 1269dfd48d71aecb0bd3fd67a0bdb3e01f29e445; ff4b4dea4ca735932eadf13c15a729fb185c5031; 9a01515a520b54839cd69126b9735459698f1052; e8a0cb3e0203bf2ee209076ddecce1bc5987f54a; 77926621f3d6608b7a31b26ec638573896ed545b; e50bbc3e1f42de32b1493800e9752454092d432c; 1106c15978e3eb8714ced02b0eb0b3f55152cd40; c76a9727a0bf1ab0b5a79be4281608cc0ce9b840; eb89a98f2e640bb6dbca9b1f2da3098528b7764c,b2ba21ab87878f5eaa77c4a975dd436c460b64e7; bf13ec0f484e87fe24f64dc294d5c900cbc6ee53; 46a10656579e294388348ff88ef054fc386654dc; b15e965f2dff20285b6275f9e28ce000bda4e78b; 3bec87a01916d25f8393a8815fc75495fcef1e97; 416322687b9fc88ed0e4df51aa20335d61cb79e3; 6618910e60a7a3f4933078b2ea1dfcf90cec59cc; 0baabeb55e3618388b299f06c8837116b324584f; e4c169b5fb2dd7286e5f8acbfbc8314a98817144; 8fe739367f00374aa50b49dbd6d719283b088a8a; 915fcc63188d7e11fa5b38c5fd3ee4203903bf10; 3427ea3b26dc8a3eddf573a9f977ff8e5096fc65; 65f3a9fd832cbf48dfeffceaf4361864919cf93e,Journal of molecular cell biology,4 5,"

4240215cf2b0a816b3b1dd1a967394ff8e088326,A Decision Theoretic Approach to A/B Testing,"A/B testing is ubiquitous within the machine learning and data science operations of internet companies. Generically, the idea is to perform a statistical test of the hypothesis that a new feature is better than the existing platform---for example, it results in higher revenue. If the p value for the test is below some pre-defined threshold---often, 0.05---the new feature is implemented. The difficulty of choosing an appropriate threshold has been noted before, particularly because dependent tests are often done sequentially, leading some to propose control of the false discovery rate (FDR) rather than use of a single, universal threshold. However, it is still necessary to make an arbitrary choice of the level at which to control FDR. Here we suggest a decision-theoretic approach to determining whether to adopt a new feature, which enables automated selection of an appropriate threshold. Our method has the basic ingredients of any decision-theory problem: a loss function, action space, and a notion of optimality, for which we choose Bayes risk. However, the loss function and the action space differ from the typical choices made in the literature, which has focused on the theory of point estimation. We give some basic results for Bayes-optimal thresholding rules for the feature adoption decision, and give some examples using eBay data. The results suggest that the 0.05 p-value threshold may be too conservative in some settings, but that its widespread use may reflect an ad-hoc means of controlling multiplicity in the common case of repeatedly testing variants of an experiment when the threshold is not reached.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""David Goldberg"", ids = ""38111918""); list(name = ""James E.

Recent work has shown that commonly used methods do not control the false discovery rate due to the peculiarity of these data (e.g. high sparsity), leading to an abundance of false positive results. Since single-cell RNA-seq shares some of these peculiarities, we apply methods developed for single cell differential expression to microbiome data. We compare these approaches to methods developed for bulk RNA-seq and microbiome data, in terms of suitability of distributional assumptions, ability to control false discoveries, consistency, replicability, and power. We benchmark these methods using 100 manually curated datasets from 16S and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing. A simulation framework is developed to assess the impact of experimental design in power analysis. Our analyses suggest that DESeq2 and limma-voom show the best performance.

621726d0464a01b86d828ca26b79727aca9b3097,Gene Expression Profiling in Down Syndrome Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Identifies Distinct Profiles Associated with CRLF2 Expression Status.,"Abstract 2389 Poster Board II-366 Children with Down syndrome (DS) have a 10 to 20-fold increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and they have experienced poorer outcomes on recent major protocols worldwide. The cytogenetic abnormalities which are generally common in childhood ALL and contribute to risk-based treatment assignment are markedly less frequent in children with DS-ALL. Recently, activating mutations in Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) have been identified in approximately 20% of DS-ALL, and interstitial deletions involving cytokine receptor-like factor 2 ( CRLF2 ) in approximately 50% of DS-ALL. Global gene expression profiling may provide insights into the biologic consequences of these molecular lesions. We performed microarray analysis of RNA from diagnostic bone marrow samples in 23 DS-ALL and 26 non-DS ALL cases using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 array. CRLF2 expression was high in 10 of the 23 DS-ALL cases, 3 of which also bore JAK2 mutations, and in a single non-DS ALL case. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated clustering of non-DS ALL cases belonging to known cytogenetic subgroups such as E2A-PBX1 , MLL rearrangement, and high hyperdiploidy. In contrast, neither DS-ALL cases overall nor the JAK2 -mutated or high CRLF2 expressing cases formed a cohesive cluster. Supervised analysis identified 43 genes that were differentially expressed between CRLF2 high versus low cases with a false discovery rate Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",2009,Biology,"list(name = ""Karen R.

f7060d9f89c998801ea3d5897d3250f5fce0efe8,Proximal femoral head transcriptome reveals novel candidate genes related to epiphysiolysis in broiler chickens,"BackgroundThe proximal femoral head separation (FHS) or epiphysiolysis is a prevalent disorder affecting the chicken femur epiphysis, being considered a risk factor to infection which can cause bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis in broilers. To identify the genetic mechanisms involved in epiphysiolysis, differentially expressed (DE) genes in the femur of normal and FHS-affected broilers were identified using RNA-Seq technology. Femoral growth plate (GP) samples from 35-day-old commercial male broilers were collected from 4 healthy and 4 FHS-affected broilers. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina paired-end protocol. Differentially expressed genes were obtained using the edgeR package based on the False Discovery Rate (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05).ResultsApproximately 16 million reads/sample were generated with 2â€‰Ã—â€‰100 bp paired-end reads. After data quality control, approximately 12 million reads/sample were mapped to the reference chicken genome (Galgal5). A total of 12,645 genes were expressed in the femur GP. Out of those, 314 were DE between groups, being 154 upregulated and 160 downregulated in FHS-affected broilers. In the functional analyses, several biological processes (BP) were overrepresented. Among them, those related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM), bone development, blood circulation and lipid metabolism, which are more related to chicken growth, are possibly involved with the onset of FHS. On the other hand, BP associated to apoptosis or cell death and immune response, which were also found in our study, could be related to the consequence of the FHS.ConclusionsGenes with potential role in the epiphysiolysis were identified through the femur head transcriptome analysis, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate bone development in fast-growing chickens. In this study, we highlighted the importance of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix related genes in triggering FHS.

dd0138f8e590ba7c5f34b8f1e388f5d29917daea,Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in whole blood reveals epigenetic signatures associated with migraine,"BackgroundMigraine is a common heritable neurovascular disorder typically characterised by episodic attacks of severe pulsating headache and nausea, often accompanied by visual, auditory or other sensory symptoms. Although genome-wide association studies have identified over 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with migraine, there remains uncertainty about the casual genes involved in disease pathogenesis and how their function is regulated.ResultsWe performed an epigenome-wide association study, quantifying genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in 67 migraine cases and 67 controls with a matching age and sex distribution. Association analyses between migraine and methylation probe expression, after adjustment for cell type proportions, indicated an excess of small P values, but there was no significant single-probe association after correction for multiple testing (Pâ€‰<â€‰1.09â€‰Ã—â€‰10âˆ’â€‰7). However, utilising a 1Â kb sliding window approach to combine adjacent migraine-methylation association P values, we identified 62 independent differentially methylated regions (DMRs) underlying migraine (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Migraine association signals were subtle but consistent in effect direction across the length of each DMR. Subsequent analyses showed that the migraine-associated DMRs were enriched in regulatory elements of the genome and were in close proximity to genes involved in solute transportation and haemostasis.ConclusionsThis study represents the first genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in migraine. We have identified DNA methylation in the whole blood of subjects associated with migraine, highlighting novel loci that provide insight into the biological pathways and mechanisms underlying migraine pathogenesis.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zachary F.

a6adbf9002a7d5f6758945e53af628bbe4b475d9,An epigenome-wide association analysis of cardiac autonomic responses among a population of welders,"DNA methylation is one of the potential epigenetic mechanisms associated with various adverse cardiovascular effects; however, its association with cardiac autonomic dysfunction, in particular, is unknown. In the current study, we aimed to identify epigenetic variants associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic responses. Cardiac autonomic responses were measured with two novel markers: acceleration capacity (AC) and deceleration capacity (DC). We examined DNA methylation levels at more than 472,506 CpG probes through the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay. We conducted separate linear mixed models to examine associations of DNA methylation levels at each CpG with AC and DC. One CpG (cg26829071) located in the GPR133 gene was negatively associated with DC values after multiple testing corrections through false discovery rate. Our study suggests the potential functional importance of methylation in cardiac autonomic responses.

b061c2b3b140dd79fb694e1f843ae99828e22206,ROPE: high-dimensional network modeling with robust control of edge FDR,"Network modeling has become increasingly popular for analyzing genomic data, to aid in the interpretation and discovery of possible mechanistic components and therapeutic targets. However, genomic-scale networks are high-dimensional models and are usually estimated from a relatively small number of samples. Therefore, their usefulness is hampered by estimation instability. In addition, the complexity of the models is controlled by one or more penalization (tuning) parameters where small changes to these can lead to vastly different networks, thus making interpretation of models difficult. This necessitates the development of techniques to produce robust network models accompanied by estimation quality assessments. 
We introduce Resampling of Penalized Estimates (ROPE): a novel statistical method for robust network modeling. The method utilizes resampling-based network estimation and integrates results from several levels of penalization through a constrained, over-dispersed beta-binomial mixture model. ROPE provides robust False Discovery Rate (FDR) control of network estimates and each edge is assigned a measure of validity, the q-value, corresponding to the FDR-level for which the edge would be included in the network model. We apply ROPE to several simulated data sets as well as genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that ROPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of FDR control and robust performance across data sets. We illustrate how to use ROPE to make a principled model selection for which genomic associations to study further. ROPE is available as an R package on CRAN.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Jonatan Kallus"", ids = ""17828108""); list(name = ""JosÃ© SÃ¡nchez"", ids = ""83747921""); list(name = ""Alexandra Jauhiainen"", ids = ""50068962""); list(name = ""Sven Nelander"", ids = ""49976404""); list(name = ""Rebecka Jornsten"", ids = ""4947064"")",,953959ce37cfaf25c94e111a7de1c84cb55557ce; ca6fbe5d56d0b6ca855fcc15f2455295778083d8,arXiv: Computation,,

This is particularly true for the equine species. Here we present a first Equine PeptideAtlas encompassing high-resolution tandem MS analyses of 51 samples representing a selection of equine tissues and body fluids from healthy and diseased animals. The raw data were processed through the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline to yield high quality identification of proteins and peptides. The current release comprises 24Â 131 distinct peptides representing 2636 canonical proteins observed at false discovery rates of 0.2% at the peptide level and 1.4% at the protein level. Data from the Equine PeptideAtlas are available for experimental planning, validation of new datasets, and as a proteomic data mining resource. The advantages of the Equine PeptideAtlas are demonstrated by examples of mining the contents for information on potential and well-known equine acute phase proteins, which have extensive general interest in the veterinary clinic.

b9664f22144cc52f179a60ecbb93f7089464dafd,Vulnerability of multiple large-scale brain networks in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Aberrations of large-scale brain networks are found in the majority of neurodegenerative disorders. The brain connectivity alterations underlying dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) remain, however, still elusive, with contrasting results possibly due to the pathological and clinical heterogeneity characterizing this disorder. Here, we provide a molecular assessment of brain network alterations, based on cerebral metabolic measurements as proxies of synaptic activity and density, in a large cohort of DLB patients (N = 72). We applied a seed-based interregional correlation analysis approach (pâ€‰<â€‰.01, false discovery rate corrected) to evaluate large-scale resting-state networks' integrity and their interactions. We found both local and long-distance metabolic connectivity alterations, affecting the posterior cortical networks, that is, primary visual and the posterior default mode network, as well as the limbic and attention networks, suggesting a widespread derangement of the brain connectome. Notably, patients with the lowest visual and attention cognitive scores showed the most severe connectivity derangement in regions of the primary visual network. In addition, network-level alterations were differentially associated with the core clinical manifestations, namely, hallucinations with more severe metabolic dysfunction of the attention and visual networks, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder with alterations of connectivity of attention and subcortical networks. These multiple network-level vulnerabilities may modulate the core clinical and cognitive features of DLB and suggest that DLB should be considered as a complex multinetwork disorder.",2019,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arianna Sala"", ids = ""48706230""); list(name = ""Silvia Paola Caminiti"", ids = ""40240556""); list(name = ""Leonardo Iaccarino"", ids = ""6069939""); list(name = ""Luca Beretta"", ids = ""73775268""); list(name = ""Sandro Iannaccone"", ids = ""2362243""); list(name = ""G.

They allow users to (visually) examine many hypotheses and make inference with simple interactions, and thus incur the issue commonly known in statistics as the ""multiple hypothesis testing error."" In this work, we propose a solution to integrate the control of multiple hypothesis testing into interactive data exploration systems. A key insight is that existing methods for controlling the false discovery rate (such as FDR) are not directly applicable to interactive data exploration. We therefore discuss a set of new control procedures that are better suited for this task and integrate them in our system, QUDE. Via extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets we demonstrate how QUDE can help experts and novice users alike to efficiently control false discoveries.",2017,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Zheguang Zhao"", ids = ""3361009""); list(name = ""Lorenzo De Stefani"", ids = ""34627565""); list(name = ""Emanuel Zgraggen"", ids = ""1945956""); list(name = ""Carsten Binnig"", ids = ""2691974""); list(name = ""Eli Upfal"", ids = ""1735099""); list(name = ""Tim Kraska"", ids = ""1746961"")",d89f7d3be7412f79c129889218b85349203b26ef; 4119c775ac55f9400d5f2e183d5dd1723bb9d0f0; 18c2d0b44a0c292ce76696bfe1dfd6839fe09ff9; 234a053d903d20173e73e71641fb1f0481d4069d; 64243ed743f570ae0ed171d82b5d97f06ede7a39; 94b99ebd0e9e17c15068121883a6c395bd10712d; 88cb7136cfcd87d9b93ec039359d2fbab158f3de; 5f3773867fe11b91951dc5b3fc5699d99d90197b; 9cee4bf5ae08bdd342127281873c16cde824dac2; 375a1a7735a68e1fdefd2fbed9cc8a7d3df21a2c; ed1a47384330fa8f306b849a35bfd5e21c7c9ad8; a6613fc6e0f8dd9a538ea901db2317b4ce3644bb; 7a930577bff9ce3717e0b9f9692177e8ed522519; fc8f734e1771f80723adb29cb7e5d7b1ec014639; 208dccdb94f93eb236953f672bb937b2e57aac3a; 95576dd17904b5faca2c59598d97c20b6b6566c4; dda199bcb834114bcf1a7a58be5bb6e46a93888b; c66b325b36987fea0393c003b0aad9cabccedb8e; 7936c363d248003d3c6b7df896285c791cbebe86; dea84182dd302a3ae97e0f577c0e7f9a1fe38a7d; a979f050861b341c3bf4eb7be12d5ee0d87b44d0; 305600f3cba8a63bad1bedeab34a299bf748754b; 663108c231afdb91ca1e8af8ef8a6a937b5a6e20; d40d9ed8979aa7d6be9c5cfd31db3936c5830839; d4cb420aa72886a726ea8232f56f6fe906c4d9fb; 1dec8751277ddca4cf990a2867d2a154de86606e; ad8c152b67cdd6ad302414f1fa89824f1b92638b; 359408564930a75e5a630cba4760a35129def16b; a52870ceb1688616acc2f80d6955d2145e6d64ea; 8c5e53795c8c2f783caf2e7cf6067c1727610c1a; 9f3209e15bbd958dfc000a430c87a69528ffa9ac; 90dc5fa2f8f1f41c2e43f60ba9da5475c4165b8c; 4f35451a5e8983dedbaa239f201333d7371f9af2; 8fbda957a3268855b447dbb7e4cd8e5e19cf0bfe,83a17e34882c24b4ff407f3e75525631d332df49; b0ebbcf713b3ddf3f94325bc58dc39ff76fdc412; 402f68ac3e61bea7b15c82d7290a57c44f4b9afa; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; 8f1408d33858a78f90f9000a34856664fc639ae4; 4c815e21c909211d7c047a2437938b24217e0a22; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 8c70a0a39a686bf80b76cb1b77f9eef156f6432d; 131a422dcad1ba3c89fc56f4b5255aed32c65d2e; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; a7fee9072b5cc9dafbc9a4851cdd4c9ea66c5aa2; 47f4b51e66d19fdc8feef5421aeb89f72acf44a3; e829ab6b80ea65febb23264e44711e51304b1ed3; 0f4ea95b4de8e2bf750d2e5edfb4acd13b3d2e7d; 38bb2fa3dcadf9fad63a0893f42c6d76b34ccb0e; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; dc39c68a00e38f2993b450eb01c96e1d032ab850; 4b03e5dd55ebd501b91bc6942854b4cafb0cffcb; 4e4479340434e42dd72bee5a652b6b6ab3633538; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f1f4386524be3ed96caaf05f661aacb94db1e566; 6bbe1d686263fee388c16ee6bb84b8f378e38e47; 6920a43dc904b8e7d3868c9f906b10aaf3fd72b3; acbc31088f4c728c0bfeb20dbad49adc7fc8d2cc; 3d3b2a4f1ae4e029a43c22171cb61f3c56516d72,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM International Conference on Management of Data,,
1d6137b95b4590b0d825d0a6932436ef8e25be41,Abstract 175: Performance of a Multilocus Genetic Risk Score Derived from Top Signals in the Cardiogram+C4d Consortium in Predicting Incident Coronary Disease in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) to date have identified 30 CAD susceptibility loci but the ability to use this information to improve risk prediction remains limited. A meta-analysis of the GWAS and Cardio Metabochip data produced by the CARDIoGRAM+C4D consortium representing 63,253 cases and 126,820 controls has identified 1885 SNPs passing a False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold of 0.5%. We hypothesized that an expanded multi locus genetic risk score (GRS) incorporating genotype information at all loci below an FDR of 0.5% would perform better than a GRS restricted to 42 loci reaching genome wide significance and tested this hypothesis in subjects of European ancestry participating in the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Community (ARIC) study. Models testing the GRS were either minimally (age and sex) or fully adjusted for traditional risk factors (TRFs). The Figure shows the hazard ratio (HZ) and 95% CI for incident events comparing each quintile of GRS to the middle quintile. The GRS including genotype information at all loci with an FDR of 0.5% noticeably improves risk prediction over the GRS restricted to genome wide significant loci in both the minimally and fully adjusted models based on several metrics including i) HR per GRS quintile, ii) the HR per SD of the GRS, and iii) the logistic regression pseudo R2, and iv) the c statistic. The HR per GRS quintile and per SD of GRS were all lower in the fully adjusted models compared to the respective minimally adjusted models but the reduction of the HR was more striking for the models that tested the more expansive GRS. These findings suggest that a larger proportion of novel GWAS CAD loci are mediating their effects through TRFs. While these findings demonstrate some progress in risk prediction using GWAS loci, both the limited and the expanded GRS continues to explain a relatively small proportion of the overall variance compared to TRF. Thus, the clinical utility of a CAD GRS remains to be determined.",2012,Biology,"list(name = ""Themistocles L. Assimes"", ids = ""1868749""); list(name = ""Benjamin A.

4b21d0e2c892da53f4cbe42bef915bb6e116c30d,Microarray analysis of aging-associated immune system alterations in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of F344 rats.,"The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is an area of the brain stem that contains diverse neural substrates that are involved in systems critical for physiological function. There is evidence that aging affects some neural substrates within the RVLM, although age-related changes in RVLM molecular mechanisms are not well established. The goal of the present study was to characterize the transcriptomic profile of the aging RVLM and to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with altered gene expression in the RVLM, with an emphasis on immune system associated gene transcripts. RVLM tissue punches from young, middle-aged, and aged F344 rats were analyzed with Agilent's whole rat genome microarray. The RVLM gene expression profile varied with age, and an association between chronological age and specific RVLM gene expression patterns was observed [P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.3]. Functional analysis of RVLM microarray data via gene ontology profiling and pathway analysis identified upregulation of genes associated with immune- and stress-related responses and downregulation of genes associated with lipid biosynthesis and neurotransmission in aged compared with middle-aged and young rats. Differentially expressed genes associated with the complement system and microglial cells were further validated by quantitative PCR with separate RVLM samples (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.1). The present results have identified age-related changes in the transcriptomic profile of the RVLM, modifications that may provide the molecular backdrop for understanding age-dependent changes in physiological regulation.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sivasai Balivada"", ids = ""3681675""); list(name = ""Chanran K.

We sought to determine whether Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which is associated with greater metabolic improvement, differentially affects the phosphosphingolipidome compared with adjustable gastric banding (AGB).Subjects/Methods:Fasting sera were available from 59 obese women (body mass index range 37â€“51â€‰kgâ€‰mâˆ’2; n=37 RYGB and 22 AGB) before surgery, then at 1 (21 RYGB, 12 AGB) and 3 months follow-up (19 RYGB, 12 AGB). HPLC-MS/MS was used to quantify 131 lipids from nine structural classes. DXA measurements and laboratory parameters were also obtained. The associations between lipids and clinical measurements were studied with P-values adjusted for the false discovery rate (FDR).Results:Both surgical procedures rapidly induced weight loss and improved clinical profiles, with RYGB producing better improvements in fat mass, and serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and orosomucoid (FDRâ€‰<10%). Ninety-three (of 131) lipids were altered by surgeryâ€”the majority decreasingâ€”with 29 lipids differentially affected by RYGB during the study period. The differential effect of the surgeries remained statistically significant for 20 of these lipids after adjusting for differences in weight loss between surgery types. The RYGB signature consisted of phosphatidylcholine species not exceeding 36 carbons, and ceramides and sphingomyelins containing C22 to C25 fatty acids. RYGB also led to a sustained increase in unsaturated ceramide and sphingomyelin species. The RYGB-specific lipid changes were associated with decreases in body weight, total and LDL-C, orosomucoid and increased HOMA-S (FDRâ€‰<10%).Conclusions:Concomitant with greater metabolic improvement, RYGB induced early and sustained changes in phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and ceramides that were independent of greater weight loss. These data suggest that RYGB may specifically alter sphingolipid metabolism, which, in part, could explain the better metabolic outcomes of this surgical procedure.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Brandon D.

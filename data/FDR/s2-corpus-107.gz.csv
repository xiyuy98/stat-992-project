We molecularly characterized two such deletions, selecting two genes in this region, exportin 1 (XPO1) and orthodenticle homolog 1 (OTX1) for association studies in three North American cohorts (Autism Spectrum Disorder â€“ Canadian American Research Consortium (ASDâ€“CARC), New York, and Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE)) and one Italian cohort (SocietÃ  Italiana per la Ricerca e la Formazione sullâ€™Autismo (SIRFA)) of families with ASD. In XPO1, rs6735330 was associated with autism in all four cohorts (P<0.05), being significant in ASDâ€“CARC cohorts (P-value following false discovery rate correction for multiple testing (PFDR)=1.29 Ã— 10âˆ’5), the AGRE cohort (PFDR=0.0011) and the combined families (PFDR=2.34 Ã— 10âˆ’9). Similarly, in OTX1, rs2018650 and rs13000344 were associated with autism in ASDâ€“CARC cohorts (PFDR=8.65 Ã— 10âˆ’7 and 6.07 Ã— 105, respectively), AGRE cohort (PFDR=0.0034 and 0.015, respectively) and the combined families (PFDR=2.34 Ã— 10âˆ’9 and 0.00017, respectively); associations were marginal or insignificant in the New York and SIRFA cohorts. A significant association (PFDR=2.63 Ã— 10âˆ’11) was found for the rs2018650Gâ€“rs13000344C haplotype. The above three SNPs were associated with severity of social interaction and verbal communication deficits and repetitive behaviors (P-values <0.01). No additional deletions were identified following screening of 798 ASD individuals. Our results indicate that deletion 2p15â€“p16.1 is not commonly associated with idiopathic ASD, but represents a novel contiguous gene syndrome associated with a constellation of phenotypic features (autism, intellectual disability, craniofacial/CNS dysmorphology), and that XPO1 and OXT1 may contribute to ASD in 2p15â€“p16.1 deletion cases and non-deletion cases of ASD mapping to this chromosome region.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xudong Liu"", ids = ""36427779""); list(name = ""Patrick R L Malenfant"", ids = ""143649197""); list(name = ""Chelsea Reesor"", ids = ""1405118842""); list(name = ""Alana Lee"", ids = ""7728675""); list(name = ""Melissa L.

48364e1b40e696e0ce700b7485420b54ad9aa74a,Nonlinear Network Reconstruction from Gene Expression Data Using Marginal Dependencies Measured by DCOL,"Reconstruction of networks from high-throughput expression data is an important tool to identify new regulatory relations. Given that nonlinear and complex relations exist between biological units, methods that can utilize nonlinear dependencies may yield insights that are not provided by methods using linear associations alone. We have previously developed a distance to measure predictive nonlinear relations, the Distance based on Conditional Ordered List (DCOL), which is sensitive and computationally efficient on large matrices. In this study, we explore the utility of DCOL in the reconstruction of networks, by combining it with local false discovery rate (lfdr)-based inference. We demonstrate in simulations that the new method named nlnet is effective in recovering hidden nonlinear modules. We also demonstrate its utility using a single cell RNA seq dataset.

add41e66b85b3550a6332a34356509b88e36ca79,Extended Duration Nocturnal Hemodialysis and Changes in Plasma Metabolite Profiles.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
In-center, extended duration nocturnal hemodialysis has been associated with variable clinical benefits, but the effect of extended duration hemodialysis on many established uremic solutes and other components of the metabolome is unknown. We determined the magnitude of change in metabolite profiles for patients on extended duration nocturnal hemodialysis.


DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS
In a 52-week prospective, observational study, we followed 33 patients receiving conventional thrice weekly hemodialysis who converted to nocturnal hemodialysis (7-8 hours per session, three times per week). A separate group of 20 patients who remained on conventional hemodialysis (3-4 hours per session, three times per week) served as a control group. For both groups, we applied liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling on stored plasma samples collected from all participants at baseline and after 1 year. We examined longitudinal changes in 164 metabolites among those who remained on conventional hemodialysis and those who converted to nocturnal hemodialysis using Wilcoxon rank sum tests adjusted for multiple comparisons (false discovery rate <0.05).


RESULTS
On average, the nocturnal group had 9.6 hours more dialysis per week than the conventional group. Among 164 metabolites, none changed significantly from baseline to study end in the conventional group. Twenty-nine metabolites changed in the nocturnal group, 21 of which increased from baseline to study end (including all branched-chain amino acids). Eight metabolites decreased after conversion to nocturnal dialysis, including l-carnitine and acetylcarnitine. By contrast, several established uremic retention solutes, including p-cresol sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and trimethylamine N-oxide, did not change with extended dialysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Across a wide array of metabolites examined, extended duration hemodialysis was associated with modest changes in the plasma metabolome, with most differences relating to metabolite increases, despite increased dialysis time. Few metabolites showed reduction with more dialysis, and no change in several established uremic toxins was observed.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""S.

07d2a18e7eb6e2d1f16e0556a7a025b3fbaa1cd0,Abstract 4527: The HER3-EREG axis and its role in colorectal cancer aggression,"Proceedings: AACR 103rd Annual Meeting 2012â€â€ Mar 31â€Apr 4, 2012; Chicago, IL

Yearly, 50,000 Americans die of colorectal cancer metastases to liver and lung. EGFR-targeted agents improve survival in a subset of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) cases, and overexpression of the HER-family ligands amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) correlates with EGFR-targeted agent susceptibility. Here we present evidence of association between EREG overexpression and disease aggression by showing that knockdown of EREG or HER3 impede anchorage independent growth in the HCT 116 CRC cell line. We also find that a HER3-EREG axis gene signature groups mCRC tumors into prognostically distinct groups. Snap-frozen CRC hepatic metastases (65) with patient matched normal liver, as well as 71 primary CRC tumors with patient matched normal colonic mucosa were analyzed via qRT-PCR for receptors (HER1-4) and ligands (AREG, and EREG). Among the mCRC cases HER2, HER3, AREG, and EREG were expressed at higher levels than unmatched normal mucosa (p 50 um diameter) of 170 for HER3, and 285 for EREG as compared to 530 for the empty vector (p<0.005). RNA from 3 distinct sets of HER3, EREG, and empty vector infections was assayed on Agilent Human GE 4x44K v2 microarrays. Unsupervised Principle Component Analysis (PCA) suggested broad concordance in the impact of EREG or HER3 knockdown upon the expression profile. Statistical Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) comparing HER3, and EREG knockdowns to empty vector control revealed 205, and 432 differentially expressed genes with at least a 1.5 fold-change and a false discovery rate of 0%. When HER3 and EREG differential gene lists were compared, 95 overlapping genes with 100% directional agreement were observed. For 51 mCRC cases RNA was available for microarray analysis. A predictor of HER3-EREG activity was constructed from 250 genes that discriminate HER3/EREG knockdown and empty vector control cells and are generally variable in tumors. The predictor was used to assign a HER3-EREG activity score to each mCRC case. This score is significantly associated with OS (p=0.005) with the top 50% of patients by HER3-EREG score demonstrating 5 year OS of 23% as compared to 49% for cases in the lower half of HER3-EREG activity.

980ec3bfc0a30c0f6e85d627e1977370fda73151,Differences in DNA Methylation Patterns Between Vegans and Non-vegetarians in the AHS-2 Cohort (FS11-06-19).,"Objectives
It is unclear how diets differing in content of animal products affect DNA methylation patterns. We sought to determine if DNA methylation patterns differed between vegans and non-vegetarians in the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort.


Methods
DNA methylation was profiled using the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip in white blood cells of 137 participants in the AHS-2 cohort classified as vegan (57) or non-vegetarian (80) based on validated diet history data. Linear regression models were generated to test associations between diet pattern and methylation, where the response variable represented methylation intensity for individual CpG sites. This was repeated for sites separated into gene regions or in relation to CpG islands. CpG methylation was also averaged across each gene. The permutation-identified null distribution, false discovery rate of Storey et al was used to adjust for multiple testing.


Results
A total of 53,809 individual CpG sites were estimated to be differentially methylated (non-null). Of these, with this small sample, we could individually identify only up to 5.5% (differing by gene region) at FDR <0.05. A vegan diet was associated almost exclusively with hypomethylation of individual CpG sites. Significant CpG sites numbered 2504 within CpG islands, 749 and 13 CpG sites 0-200 base pairs or 201-1500 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS200 and TSS1500), respectively, and 51 and 458 sites falling within the 5' UTR and first exon, respectively. The greatest difference in methylation was observed for sites mapping to TSS200 and CpG islands, where methylation was 9.2% lower in vegans. No differences were found when CpG methylation was averaged to obtain a cumulative value for all sites (no FDR criterion) within each gene region. A total of 328 genes (averaging all methylation regions) were significantly hypomethylated in vegans relative to non-vegetarians at FDR <0.05. The greatest number of genes were hypomethylated when considering methylation of only CpG islands, followed by the TSS200, first exon, and TSS1500 regions.


Conclusions
Our findings suggest substantial differences in methylation of CpG sites and genes, particularly in regulatory regions, between vegans and non-vegetarians, with a preponderance of hypomethylation among vegans.

ada0d8bb44d836ee52fe18910affdc1620551a4a,Testicular phosphoproteome in perfluorododecanoic acid-exposed rats.,"Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) is a common environmental pollutant, which has been detected in human sera and has adverse effects on testicular function in animal models. Exploring phosphorylation events in testes helps elucidate the specific phosphorylation signals involved in testicular toxicity of PFDoA. Combining efficient prefractionation of tryptic peptide mixtures using self-packed reversed phase C18 columns with TiO2 and IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment techniques followed by 2D-LC-MS/MS, we identified 4077 unique phosphopeptides from 1777 proteins with a false discovery rate below 1.0% in the testes of rats exposed to PFDoA for 110 days. In addition, 937 novel phosphorylation sites were discovered in testicular proteins. Hundreds of phosphorylated proteins identified might be involved in spermatogenesis and sperm function. With increasing PFDoA dosage, the number of casein kinase 2 kinase-modified peptides significantly increased. Pathway analysis suggested that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cell division cycle protein 2 (CDC2) may have contributed to sperm activity and testicular function. By in vitro experiments, CDC2 phosphorylation activity was found to be likely involved in PFDoA-induced toxicity in Leydig cells. This study provides the first examination of the whole proteins' phosphorylation profile in rat testis and suggests that the MAPK pathway and CDC2 protein phosphorylation are critical for PFDoA testicular toxicity.",2013,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zhimin Shi"", ids = ""46451208""); list(name = ""Junjie Hou"", ids = ""2959781""); list(name = ""Xuejiang Guo"", ids = ""2284095""); list(name = ""Hongxia Zhang"", ids = ""39926961""); list(name = ""Fuquan Yang"", ids = ""4814643""); list(name = ""Jiayin Dai"", ids = ""47708907"")",599fe9cc009b828e4b08f47384121e1c61e0a33e; 6268a33833fadeb6bf24cd83350dc2d0a3125ea6; 1d240cd30b8d3024e5ac57d0336b09241ea14855; 4bf9786f9e1d5cc7cd0ec3f1f08476c9f59e05c9; 2266d4702180686d9a0d9d05958edbcd8dce95c0,,Toxicology letters,221 2,"

2544949c65e5bf3898df558375b72cda49d83ccc,A step-down multiple hypotheses testing procedure that controls the false discovery rate under independence,"For the problems of multiple hypotheses testing, Benjamini and Hochberg (1995, J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57, 289â€“300), proposed the control of the expected ratio of the number of erroneous rejections to the number of total rejections, the false discovery rate (FDR). The step-up procedure given in that paper controls the FDR when the test statistics are independent. In this paper, a new step-down procedure is presented, and it also controls the FDR when the test statistics are independent. The step-down procedure neither dominates nor is dominated by the step-up procedure. In a large simulation study of the power of the two procedures, the step-down procedure turns out to be more powerful when the number of tested hypotheses is small and many of the hypotheses are far from being true. An example is given to illustrate the step-down procedure.",1999,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Yoav Benjamini"", ids = ""50679934""); list(name = ""Wei Liu"", ids = ""40474876"")",42f916d13e260513e344588c5c3b6dfc07ee8861;

696c3a1f98e0b038b820133bb2c406d44cf08064,ECKO: Ensemble of Clustered Knockoffs for multivariate inference on fMRI data,"Continuous improvement in medical imaging techniques allows the acquisition of higher-resolution images. When these are used in a predictive setting, a greater number of explanatory variables are potentially related to the dependent variable (the response). Meanwhile, the number of acquisitions per experiment remains limited. In such high dimension/small sample size setting, it is desirable to find the explanatory variables that are truly related to the response while controlling the rate of false discoveries. To achieve this goal, novel multivariate inference procedures, such as knockoff inference, have been proposed recently. However, they require the feature covariance to be well-defined, which is impossible in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called Ensemble of Clustered Knockoffs, that allows to select explanatory variables while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), up to a prescribed spatial tolerance. The core idea is that knockoff-based inference can be applied on groups (clusters) of voxels, which drastically reduces the problem's dimension; an ensembling step then removes the dependence on a fixed clustering and stabilizes the results. We benchmark this algorithm and other FDR-controlling methods on brain imaging datasets and observe empirical gains in sensitivity, while the false discovery rate is controlled at the nominal level.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Tuan-Binh Nguyen"", ids = ""90631806""); list(name = ""J'erome-Alexis Chevalier"", ids = ""121470572""); list(name = ""Bertrand Thirion"", ids = ""8493461"")",,7549e383e527ebcebb131edd57fcb08874d5d77a; f15367ed93c3505b1d62d802f3f4b769ae0f4ba5; 57cca95fdbd35ba1b283c9c6ec5ae7a81be7adfd; 144457047be2820246fb41b9f552d14cc988d4c6; 46be236b6c3896aea3866672bb4606496694fc77; c5f2ecc1c3f606089cfc57d9e590e2d3f16e0e63; 4004fe098dd8b575d742aaffc021a6af319198b8; 67529f0a3c2031282ec93440b76580de840789fa; c3620866f75cf4d2cd498abc91b598ae1ddd1300; f846ebe57af8fc9c83cd33da0985237416e96650; 97794d424f5e7cc555f6aeb187ab0849976dbeac; 62786eaf14f64d31aa0a074b58fb3f6f4b5b7e82; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,
a34c49994b57c6792a89705829c28e91d06bf3b6,COPD Exacerbation Biomarkers Validated Using Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry,"BACKGROUND
Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) result in considerable morbidity and mortality. However, there are no objective biomarkers to diagnose AECOPD.


METHODS
We used multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to quantify 129 distinct proteins in plasma samples from patients with COPD. This analytical approach was first performed in a biomarker cohort of patients hospitalized with AECOPD (Cohort A, n = 72). Proteins differentially expressed between AECOPD and convalescent states were chosen using a false discovery rate <0.01 and fold change >1.2. Protein selection and classifier building were performed using an elastic net logistic regression model. The performance of the biomarker panel was then tested in two independent AECOPD cohorts (Cohort B, n = 37, and Cohort C, n = 109) using leave-pair-out cross-validation methods.


RESULTS
Five proteins were identified distinguishing AECOPD and convalescent states in Cohort A. Biomarker scores derived from this model were significantly higher during AECOPD than in the convalescent state in the discovery cohort (p<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic cross-validation area under the curve (CV-AUC) statistic was 0.73 in Cohort A, while in the replication cohorts the CV-AUC was 0.77 for Cohort B and 0.79 for Cohort C.


CONCLUSIONS

db8a00e02470f768e2e87cc7ecdee41b3da29ea4,Detection of QTL on Bovine X Chromosome by Exploiting Linkage Disequilibrium,"A fine-mapping method exploiting linkage disequilibrium was used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the X chromosome affecting milk production, body conformation and productivity traits. The pedigree comprised 22 paternal half-sib families of Black-and-White Holstein bulls in the Netherlands in a grand-daughter design for a total of 955 sons. Twenty-five microsatellite markers were genotyped to construct a linkage map on the chromosome X spanning 170 Haldane cM with an average inter-marker distance of 7.1 cM. A covariance matrix including elements about identical-by-descent probabilities between haplotypes regarding QTL allele effects was incorporated into the animal model, and a restricted maximum-likelihood method was applied for the presence of QTL using the LDVCM program. Significance thresholds were obtained by permuting haplotypes to phenotypes and by using a false discovery rate procedure. Seven QTL responsible for conformation types (teat length, rump width, rear leg set, angularity and fore udder attachment), behavior (temperament) and a mixture of production and health (durable prestation) were detected at the suggestive level. Some QTL affecting teat length, rump width, durable prestation and rear leg set had small numbers of haplotype clusters, which may indicate good classification of alleles for causal genes or markers that are tightly associated with the causal mutation. However, higher maker density is required to better refine the QTL position and to better characterize functionally distinct haplotypes which will provide information to find causal genes for the traits.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Jong-Joo Kim"", ids = ""120086400"")",910dba53b940b71e82f5403a02c14611b802ac6a,14d46d1d2f7cd38f68f9fc68726b45db57e327b9; 0a2d99e4b49e315050380a2e21fc90450dea6ef2; 4f3d6ea25f65aef7f8353a0bd484a60a5dc760c6; 8560ac30b368dd3ff3e0c9ea9675b039079c80fc; 28087496d717dbb708af1bccc165ff6e60a68f70; 4e7696edf8888b735cb991cf438257e308fc00bf; f16186f2a77d128703645053f6537ac1362ca9f5; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 426c60c179ae1360a7a40425792ebf4d5fc6a28c; 3fcd8e853bd835d995d441ebf41310000ba8ff46; 073336410741944cda82f6312478f1a450c58a55; a5ef6436935041cecb88e15f2fa249d04a3a8374; 187bc0523dc535e19ce2f0c7ba61f32c5d61df7d; c646a101fd40a0ae0d887c8f3678b60cc2cb5e3c; b005f19ae59ac22cebf055dda61f50bfb1c19d25; 8b378948172ceba49d18c6217cecb2f3c743b3bf; 706aa6004d0a6c596c7511eba69c95ea78186640; ac1cabe5a354a855e85ffdeba9e15c3841c4b01f; 8db816a2b04ccd9d629826cecf432a4d8bb0920e; cf94e531a0ceced22bd2440ab304b42aac209b58; effbd313a338f9602e7e3b377e32d93c338d544a; 7d599382cd4ce66693c2a0145f348058f8d52ca2,Asian-australasian Journal of Animal Sciences,21,617-623

720ce92f85eaafed071935f2bd493f4c48154719,Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Trigger Contact-Dependent Tumor Promoting Genetic Alterations in Multiple Myeloma Cells,"Introduction We identified an integral role of bone marrow (BM) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis. Specifically, we found increased numbers pDCs in MM BM vs normal BM. pDCs protect tumor cells from therapy-induced cytotoxicity; promote tumor growth and survival, as well as suppress immune responses (Chauhan et al, Cancer Cell 2009, 16:309-323). Aberrant pDC function is evidenced in their interactions not only with MM cells, but also with immune effector T cells and NK cells in the MM BM milieu (Ray et al, Leukemia 2015, 29:1441-1444). Directly targeting pDC interactions with MM and immune effector cells in the MM BM milieu will be required to enhance both anti-tumor immunity and cytotoxicity. To further characterize the role of pDCs in MM pathogenesis, we utilized our pDC/MM co-culture model and analyzed genetic changes in MM cells after coculture with pDCs using next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS data was confirmed using flow cytometry analysis, and functionally validated in cocultures of pDC-MM-T cells, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays. Based on our NGS study, we have identified the metabolic ectoenzyme NT5E/CD73 as a promising novel therapeutic target in MM; primarily for its role in cancer metabolism and immunosuppression via nucleotide degradation pathway. Methods. Patient BM/PB pDC and MM cells were evaluated by flow cytometry following immunomagnetic separation (purity> 95%). pDCs were cocultured with autologous MM cells or allogeneic MM cell lines (pDC/MM; 1:5) for 48h, followed by separation of MM cells from pDCs using FACS. Total RNA from MM cells was subjected to RNAseq analysis using Illumina Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Raw sequence data were subjected to VIPER workflow generating differential expression (DEseq2) and KEGG pathway analyses. For RNAseq analysis, log2FC (fold change) values in coculture vs single control, with an FDR (False Discovery Rate) value of 95). Linear model for RNAseq analysis (Limma) and its GUI (Glimma) were used for the visualization of data. Results A total of 19,569 and 25,436 transcripts were analyzed through negative binomial (DEseq2) and linear (Limma) models, respectively. We found that 9200 (47.01%) and 9250 (36.36%) genes were differentially expressed (p Conclusions Collectively, our RNAseq NGS analysis of pDCs-induced gene changes in MM cells validates our previously published findings (Ray et al Leukemia 2014; 28(8): 1716-1724; Leukemia 2015; Leukemia 2017; 31:2652-2660; Leukemia 2018,32:843-846) that these accessory cells induce growth, survival and drug resistance in tumor cells. Importantly, these studies delineate novel genes and pathways mediating these sequelae which represent targets for future therapies.

Genetic variants in lncRNAs may be involved in their abnormal expressions and associated with cancer risk. In the present study, we performed RNA sequencing on five paired breast cancer tumor and adjacent non-cancerous tissues to obtain differentially expressed lncRNAs. We systematically selected potential regulatory variants of these lncRNAs and investigated the associations between these variants and breast cancer susceptibility in 1486 breast cancer cases and 1519 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. Eleven lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between breast cancer tumor and normal tissues (false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤0.05 and fold-change â‰¥2), including two known lncRNAs HOTAIR and UCA1. We subsequently genotyped 20 variants located on these lncRNAs and identified two variants (rs11471161 in AC104135.3 and rs3751232 in RP11-1060J15.4) associated with breast cancer risk. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the variant allele of rs11471161 was significantly associated with a decreased breast cancer risk (additive model: OR = 0.84, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰0.74-0.94, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), while the variant allele of rs3751232 showed an increased risk of breast cancer (additive model: OR = 1.20, 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.02-1.40, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.027). Further co-expression analysis indicated that AC104135.3 associated with ERBB2, which promotes the development and progression of breast cancer through overexpression. Together, these results suggest that genetic variants rs11471161 and rs3751232 in AC104135.3, and RP11-1060J15.4, respectively, may influence the susceptibility to breast cancer in the Chinese population.

3d50c188f048db00d9555c86c6a313b7c16e7476,Statistics in Medicine 3rd edition,"Statistics in Medicine, Third Edition makes medical statistics easy to understand by students, practicing physicians, and researchers. The book begins with databases from clinical medicine and uses such data to give multiple worked-out illustrations of every method. The text opens with how to plan studies from conception to publication and what to do with your data, and follows with step-by-step instructions for biostatistical methods from the simplest levels (averages, bar charts) progressively to the more sophisticated methods now being seen in medical articles (multiple regression, noninferiority testing). Examples are given from almost every medical specialty and from dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, and health care management. A preliminary guide is given to tailor sections of the text to various lengths of biostatistical courses.

c1a56aba670fd8facfbe6f55557ce62a71c1085d,Abstract 162: Biomarker identification of residual triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT),"Backgrounds Residual TNBC after standard NCT has a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers that correlate with prognosis and can be used as novel therapeutic targets in this disease Methods 54 residual TNBC were identified. Protein was extracted and 76 antibiotics to proteins related to breast cancer signaling were measured by reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard model ratios were fitted for each protein and simultaneously. Cross-validation was also performed. The coefficient in the multivariable Cox model were used to calculate a risk score (RS) for each sample. Results The unsupervised clustering analysis of the proteomic profiles for the 54 residual breast cancers and 76 proteins divided the tumors into two groups without significant survival difference. Multivariable analysis using the top 25 proteins from univariable analysis at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.3 showed that IGFPB2, LKB1, and S6 were significant predictors in relapse free survival (RFS). RS model calculated based on multivariable analysis was 0.3746*IGFPB2-0.8852*LKB1+0.6012*S6, AUC=0.807. Employing crossvalidation the model was found to be reproducible. Multivariable analysis suggested that RS was an independent predictor of RFS (HR: 2.705, 95% CI 1.549 to 4.723, P-value=0.0005). Conclusions We identified a RS of three biomarkers that predict outcome in patients with residual TNBC that could be studied as therapeutic targets for this disease.

35dc4bf82a34b982998ccc176b178ca07242744a,Differential item functioning of the Boston Naming Test in cognitively normal African American and Caucasian older adults.,"Scores on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) are frequently lower for African American when compared with Caucasian adults. Although demographically based norms can mitigate the impact of this discrepancy on the likelihood of erroneous diagnostic impressions, a growing consensus suggests that group norms do not sufficiently address or advance our understanding of the underlying psychometric and sociocultural factors that lead to between-group score discrepancies. Using item response theory and methods to detect differential item functioning (DIF), the current investigation moves beyond comparisons of the summed total score to examine whether the conditional probability of responding correctly to individual BNT items differs between African American and Caucasian adults. Participants included 670 adults age 52 and older who took part in Mayo's Older Americans and Older African Americans Normative Studies. Under a two-parameter logistic item response theory framework and after correction for the false discovery rate, 12 items where shown to demonstrate DIF. Of these 12 items, 6 (""dominoes,"" ""escalator,"" ""muzzle,"" ""latch,"" ""tripod,"" and ""palette"") were also identified in additional analyses using hierarchical logistic regression models and represent the strongest evidence for race/ethnicity-based DIF.

84de2e040bd0536a0e0d0d28c2b4bca0879103bb,False discovery rate control for identifying simultaneous signals,"It is frequently of interest to jointly analyze multiple sequences of multiple tests in order to identify simultaneous signals, defined as features tested in two or more independent studies that are significant in each. For example, researchers often wish to discover genetic variants that are significantly associated with multiple traits. This paper proposes a false discovery rate control procedure for identifying simultaneous signals in two studies. A pair of test statistics is available for each feature, and the goal is to identify features for which both are non-null. Error control is difficult due to the composite nature of a non-discovery, as one of the tests in the pair can still be non-null. Very few existing methods have high power while still provably controlling the false discovery rate. This paper proposes a simple, fast, tuning parameter-free nonparametric procedure that can be shown to provide asymptotically conservative false discovery rate control. Surprisingly, the procedure does not require knowledge of either the null or the alternative distributions of the test statistics.

d103e77e7916d79ffead9df1c6b1b336977b3c68,Novel Tia Biomarkers Identified by Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics,"Background Transient ischemic attacks remain a clinical diagnosis with significant variability between physicians. Finding reliable biomarkers to identify transient ischemic attacks would improve patient care and optimize treatment. Aim Our aim is to identify novel serum TIA biomarkers through the use of mass spectroscopy-based proteomics. Methods Patients with transient neurologic symptoms were prospectively enrolled. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, an unbiased method to identify candidate proteins, was used to test the serum of the patients for biomarkers of cerebral ischemia. Three candidate proteins were found, and serum concentrations of these proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a second cohort of prospectively enrolled patients. The Student's t-test was used for comparison. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg false discovery rate controlling procedure for multiple comparison adjustments determined significance for the proteomic screen. Results Patients with transient ischemic attacks (n = 20), minor strokes (n = 15), and controls (i.e. migraine, seizure, n = 12) were enrolled in the first cohort. Ceruloplasmin, complement component C8 gamma (C8Î³), and platelet basic protein were significantly different between the ischemic group (transient ischemic attack and minor stroke) and the controls (P = 0Â·0001, P = 0Â·00027, P = 0Â·00105, respectively). A second cohort of patients with transient ischemic attack (n = 22), minor stroke (n = 20), and controls' (n = 12) serum was enrolled. Platelet basic protein serum concentrations were increased in the ischemic samples compared with control (for transient ischemic attack alone, P = 0Â·019, for the ischemic group, P = 0Â·046). Ceruloplasmin trended towards increased concentrations in the ischemic group (P = 0Â·127); no significant difference in C8Î³ (P = 0Â·44) was found. Conclusions Utilizing mass spectrometry-based proteomics, platelet basic protein has been identified as a candidate serum biomarker for transient ischemic attack. This unbiased proteomic approach may be a promising method to identify novel biomarkers to more precisely diagnose transient ischemic attacks.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""Paul M.

b3fe7b229ead7f167e3e62f4ce4df755945f8fd2,Gene expression profile analysis of human intervertebral disc degeneration,"In this study, we used microarray analysis to investigate the biogenesis and progression of intervertebral disc degeneration. The gene expression profiles of 37 disc tissue samples obtained from patients with herniated discs and degenerative disc disease collected by the National Cancer Institute Cooperative Tissue Network were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes between more and less degenerated discs were identified by significant analysis of microarray. A total of 555 genes were significantly overexpressed in more degenerated discs with a false discovery rate of < 3%. Functional annotation showed that these genes were significantly associated with membrane-bound vesicles, calcium ion binding and extracellular matrix. Protein-protein interaction analysis showed that these genes, including previously reported genes such as fibronectin, COL2A1 and Î²-catenin, may play key roles in disc degeneration. Unsupervised clustering indicated that the widely used morphology-based Thompson grading system was only marginally associated with the molecular classification of intervertebral disc degeneration. These findings indicate that detailed, systematic gene analysis may be a useful way of studying the biology of intervertebral disc degeneration.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kai Chen"", ids = ""47031586""); list(name = ""Dajiang Wu"", ids = ""4826250""); list(name = ""Xiaodong Zhu"", ids = ""49897716""); list(name = ""Haijian Ni"", ids = ""49426657""); list(name = ""Xianzhao Wei"", ids = ""67186287""); list(name = ""Ningfang Mao"", ids = ""38274927""); list(name = ""Yang Xie"", ids = ""145668114""); list(name = ""Yunfei Niu"", ids = ""40383952""); list(name = ""Ming Li"", ids = ""50652019"")",faa8a85c27d62756ddc5119c62d9751b88b0ba8b; 42b05b4a3e85b71a034dfd615e1988266ededa1b; 2d55d5b0cfd7aa2444d682cfc42b388c2ac32e7f; c3d4be3665d7ad7c290f371070c9718686271021; 56285e17fc38610a6da6c54fc299f59a842dfc6b; b0baf0eab0b39144f3fdb37ad34ab1b21165db36; 255c518b550cad39d63f03b3afce51af1ebd6903; 96a3b0c031a08ffb4ed609c2b03dacae981c97af; 4f03d21674a294e4f47d0bd161308d46754d6c54; a0a30b38c289be318baa8e2b7b734b5b7c8834b3; a6f63ccf4eab7c507794303ac7d5ede29fdb918c,e50573b554cfa9ee77dcc2e298d7073a152b7199; aee70006fd79cf1c6943e4d32cbf228da50a914c; f93c4014fafe9139a917d59248e6f411de1e7946; 015c87a8116ea0762cca72aa77e6d4e39e3eed51; 3dc7a9e70950504f5c839332e96e4c4569b671f8; 7f4e05019ddd83d2d5be4d44e860401876de3197; e676f4c6443da81d9ca47ee7a37356d72eb2fb4a; d17828b71653aee8c269c9945c038b2bfab25ed4; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; 85f447aaaec03bd383b3045d4856473a0e52109a; fb67e71f6f9496f8c51bb3b1bb8c25dfe6c23046; ddaa416e7ce297eec201884fb085057a4d7f974b; 86b8a753308990af2975babb667f1c261c50b5b4; e81ed8d2ebd1b4f8f39b7a484280474e19a06ab8; 7002dfb595f809bafc2814213940c24cc2afab3f; 9442bfc1f1970c6086f3bed38a326c23cdbdd68b; c0b9e4d88d6dfa0bacae37ed287df65d8f55698c; ceee6447b291f8052a28c9eb00ca360d6f39f9b1; 6a1d8edee51046a9b4ba2f64c0358a891d7b5369; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 5ec8b160d08f7d854ea2d25f6ec499c8b24cead9; 211600f226c4af9a58f1c9f96bf0279ba20d5732; 04f01ffe048535751dfb272e6029669ad6cb0301; 45a96ba25b2a8ad836762f8dad3f9b33eb5a3618; 21c41fcec6ac8a7f55c539ac199247f200633753; f3b0c5e186098809ecd3fb7cfe64bfef6caa203a; 7370604fa1be15f14d827fed0dcca431537dbed2; 5ca1d583e53ca84287a8767b7289dbd6fc4f46ed; 298d3ef50af3ac9951a2e3dbb675806e4dde02bd; 9b66a0b54089f0d260a6fd15204dc541c557f364; d84d7308089dee059e9935c58a3100202a092ef9; 6587feaee1e229eb44708834334d7ef63b0442ce; 9e173ba974ae821308ffe8427db3d0aadfd9fe11; 56f40c2dca911a58f3b64239d9ea7f8df90259c8; 1328f5f4bb1f269b6ce227383236d59c30f3b733; adc65ceeca92d417bc58b9dc4ceb3d1c964eeed7; 427eaafcd47b3abc620b953ff021f25925ff0e62; 42c64145dab47a9e8b223f9d3ca4ee16140e68ac; 891ed519131d028ca230541d210a7c439cfe7d56; 1f36e74165417a250c21187902bb7f24f1bbe4d5; 6aed58a6763a8dc344b6aa8586bea145d24ab5c7,Genetics and Molecular Biology,36,448 - 454
918b526ced7023a373503c757ba74298665acdce,Sleep spindle and K-complex detection using tunable Q-factor wavelet transform and morphological component analysis,"A novel framework for joint detection of sleep spindles and K-complex events, two hallmarks of sleep stage S2, is proposed. Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) signals are split into oscillatory (spindles) and transient (K-complex) components. This decomposition is conveniently achieved by applying morphological component analysis (MCA) to a sparse representation of EEG segments obtained by the recently introduced discrete tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). Tuning the Q-factor provides a convenient and elegant tool to naturally decompose the signal into an oscillatory and a transient component. The actual detection step relies on thresholding (i) the transient component to reveal K-complexes and (ii) the time-frequency representation of the oscillatory component to identify sleep spindles. Optimal thresholds are derived from ROC-like curves (sensitivity vs. FDR) on training sets and the performance of the method is assessed on test data sets. We assessed the performance of our method using full-night sleep EEG data we collected from 14 participants. In comparison to visual scoring (Expert 1), the proposed method detected spindles with a sensitivity of 83.18% and false discovery rate (FDR) of 39%, while K-complexes were detected with a sensitivity of 81.57% and an FDR of 29.54%. Similar performances were obtained when using a second expert as benchmark. In addition, when the TQWT and MCA steps were excluded from the pipeline the detection sensitivities dropped down to 70% for spindles and to 76.97% for K-complexes, while the FDR rose up to 43.62 and 49.09%, respectively. Finally, we also evaluated the performance of the proposed method on a set of publicly available sleep EEG recordings. Overall, the results we obtained suggest that the TQWT-MCA method may be a valuable alternative to existing spindle and K-complex detection methods. Paths for improvements and further validations with large-scale standard open-access benchmarking data sets are discussed.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Tarek Lajnef"", ids = ""2274531"");

With the aid of simulations, we show how, under models commonly used, the simple step-down procedure introduced by Benjamini and Hochberg controls the FDR for the dependent tests on which linkage and association genome screens are based. This adaptive multiple comparison procedure may offer an important tool for mapping susceptibility genes for complex diseases.",2003,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Chiara Sabatti"", ids = ""2139035""); list(name = ""Susan K.

86e546ce4ea179aa77b71ff638860cf9d29e2711,"Ernst Wit and John McClure John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, UK, 2004","The aim of â€˜Statistics for Microarraysâ€™ is to explain the statistical methods commonly used for microarray analysis. The book is divided into two parts: the first, â€˜Getting Good Dataâ€™, focuses on experimental design, normalisation and quality control issues. The second, â€˜Getting Good Answersâ€™, deals with higher level statistical inferences about the biological questions of interest, such as clustering samples or genes; assessing differential expression; and classification and prediction. The book opens with a useful section describing a number of experiments and associated datasets that are used throughout the book to illustrate the different stages in an analysis of a microarray dataset. An additional special feature is the inclusion of descriptions of R-language functions. Some of these are existing functions in standard R libraries, others are implementations by the authors of new methods developed in the book. The new functions are included in an R-package â€˜smidaâ€™, which, along with the datasets, is made available online at the website for the book. The book represents one of the first attempts to present a coherent exposition of the field of microarray data analysis, and is written in a clear and readable style. Although not a reference work, it has been written in such a way that one should not have to read the earlier chapters in order to understand the later ones. This idea that chapters or sections should be self-contained has been somewhat overdone and results in some statistical methods being explained more than once. For example, the definition of the t-statistic is given in both the classical and the Bayesian hypothesis sections in Chapter 8. The style is also rather repetitive within sections: for example, â€˜confoundingâ€™ is explained well on page 37, yet a separate paragraph with the heading â€˜confoundingâ€™ appears on page 38. In general, the use of cross-references within the book would have been helpful (eg Sammon plots are used at an early stage but are not introduced until later, with no cross-reference). Chapters 3 and 4 on experimental design and normalisation are very good. There is a detailed discussion of the number of replicate arrays needed to detect a given level of fold change between experimental conditions; a discussion of the variability of pooled samples; and an extensive section on finding optimal designs for two-colour arrays. Normalisation is explained well, with plots illustrating the various reasons for normalisation. The discussion of single-channel arrays, in particular those of Affymetrix, is partly dealt with in separate subsections of Chapters 3 and 4.The resulting presentation is rather messy and also slightly misleading: the probes representing a gene are not technical replicates (as claimed in Chapter 3), but represent different subsequences of the sequence encoding a gene (as correctly stated in Chapter 4). The short description of some methods for estimating gene expression measures from oligonucleotide arrays at the end of the normalisation chapter does not do justice to the large literature on this subject. The quality assessment chapter contains some instructive examples and good illustrations of the qualities of some of the most commonly used pairwise distance measures: the Euclidian, Manhattan and correlation distance measures. The chapter describes some interesting methods, such as Sammon mapping for dimensional reduction and â€˜false array imagesâ€™ for assessing array handling, but on the former point is not very clear. Sammon mapping is used to illustrate several different possible reasons for poor-quality data; however, how the different possible reasons would be distinguished is not obvious. There are two chapters on clustering methods, one on unsupervised methods used to group samples and/or genes and one on supervised methods of classification. The chapter on unsupervised clustering starts with a good discussion of different possible measures for calculating distances between clusters. It focuses mainly on hierarchical and partitioning around medoids (PAM)-type algorithms, with a brief discussion of model-based clustering at the end. The authors rightly warn against putting too much faith in agglomerative hierarchical clustering of genes, although the point could have been made better with some illustrations of where this may go wrong, in line with the good illustrations in the book on the virtues of various distance measures. The topic of gene-filtering is covered in the chapter on supervised methods. This chapter briefly introduces a number of important concepts in classification theory, predictor evaluation and cross-validation. Attention is restricted to simple methods, such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and k-nearest neighbour classification for class prediction and penalised and k-nearest neighbour regression for classifying and predicting continuous responses. Throughout the chapters on clustering, the authors present a number of new methods, particularly relating to the problem of selecting appropriate numbers of clusters or numbers of predictors, which are made available as R functions. Differential gene expression is covered in a separate chapter. The standard varieties of t-test are described, along with guidance on which to use in various situations. Moreover, p-values and error rates (familywise and false discovery rates) are discussed and different methods of obtaining p-values (parametric, bootstrap and permutation) are given. This section provides a very good introduction to one of the most widely used methods for assessing differential expression.

The objective of this study was to screen for possible biomarkers of metastatic OS to explore the mechanisms of pulmonary metastasis of OS through network construction. GSE14359 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included 5 samples from conventional OS group with 2 replicates and 4 samples from OS pulmonary metastasis group in duplicate. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were identified by limma packages in RÂ and classical t-test with the threshold of the false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) were then used to perform functional annotation (FDR < 0.01). Differential coexpression network was constructed with subspace differential coexpression analysis (SDC), and genes with high degrees in the differential coexpression network were identified. A total of 1344 genes were screened as DEGs, including 677 up- and 667 down-regulated DEGs in the pulmonary metastasis of OS. Thirty-one significantly enriched functions were obtained, such as blood vessel morphogenesis, defense response, cell death and so on. DEGs with high degrees (brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (BAI2), formin-like 1 (FMNL1), dual-specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7), transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2), CBP80/20-dependent translation initiation factor (KIAA0427) and C120rf35) in the differential coexpression network were found. BAI2, FMNL1, DUSP7 and TRPM2 may be useful markers for predicting tumor metastasis and therapeutic targets for the treatment of OS patients with metastasis.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Qing-gang Wang"", ids = ""50621829"")",6c27e51325dba2f326694e39b756836f7930f574; 1cdc254cfb55df2a0ea83acba6ca1429a160e10f; 0fb698f8a1689212b97e34a72a37f6e091650365; 063ee7f35274ecc154f04fa7898684c6fc6cd855; bb349a922eb1aeef2cce75fa27665e97fce67cd5,908fe778696208072fef9b450626658027146bd0; 84e3c828186711d5d729c060684052f6a7806bc2; 8917b76eacbd57ff9640214c3931d7057f111834; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; f36ce259de7bdc722ba494c89b61c06b2f347334; b92642d9e603f53c892bd5843879c30c76efa5e9; f2c105688a73aa8b377eca8d2e94250e947a513f; c50404fa765c2c2838a8e1047c0e8e03827f683f; 67e9d5f73443fb38d21db28505495d82a7ddbe23; 1b9f03522e7caa27fc7a0516848850ee08f379d6; 2c7e4f3e24479d0f9f8a86a95fe118ecdb9390a8; 410049df5abee98f86961a798f97ae45ff5dd30e; a782e53f69025b8c0b12d444733bcec5da05ad15; eecb07afc0229446a3b0283f563d1419224cf491; 7b3d88b7653927aad1034782de2a653ca1123d43; fd217744a3a308aaa7099efebb0d15427b455e95; 94d7824e2cefaba61a8103878265a66ba8830304; d868fe956aa01cd9b1dc1b624617067a65412e0a; 63cee13563836e05473c1ac3cb46cecb1269d551; a5e6f4ed864385bab62e577984cfa3d5ebc66036; 09caa9ae7f9eab4ffe8d59e7be312fd714dc1b2a; d476cf5ddad9fb0bfd16d4e09826e5b9fc40796d; 0e6aefc52cc98104fdd802cd4fa9878d9f5fbca5; 20a21d43f827613a84592b40d8f44f417994ec32; 13e6d58e6006bed58b0b67263ef94b3ac4c13293; 498120784ca0f9c1a5b2dff9a71a0e96c57053ca; 20a719a4d594caa54b1faa591d81eacb3f8d75c1; 8cf32f5c05e526063689acb5bf84aa8eed0e0f00; b403ebd7d5570a17d4f1520fd59bac656a3b24a8; e1998192b5eae5f2301c02d9eec46c3952bad9fe; 13d270dc4fc3116d945fbb859c3e434d6051a424; 8d93ad83a44f8ca02c38c9d40e17bb786a9e5e28; 6e742944d8acda8c2a1b945232a1dd2f3b215496; 58cfcb6d340c977e89ee93d62a8b92c3fc17b6ca; 97696e3274358e62d8f7af657c2dfcc28bf62dff; 9701998e30a0ae3c04bee201d7a3a90028e90dfa; a30092583bfd233ff07b4f9f4cd46d0986d628f0; 73d056c3299dd434d18b75eb2018228744cf3ce1; fabe518b1c9caf77d6e1cf03d5a1031e984be4ae; 4001bbd326b5293970e183df44bf7a248161da79; a411f6a0e6473137ac1a538f7cee65722fa3584f; 89c622a365dc7596db86c1e1863dd1063e77b388; 4b6835c8aa28eb6669e9043c7d778efeed918eb0; 98bbff8c67cf9bfc5ad429a8690db5a818cefb30; 81202ee0d4f9945c968021549b77cab99fcba476; be14d550a7ceaa2bf08732f0e64ca92d3b854228; 41d394faedeb15e28fa9401f1c83a62446eee6bb; 62595707880218f74e7f23598632681a9498298e; ee52365eaa6ad5a29c36e278750c6845bceca38d; 51cfa7642510066ee31044102aa503e609868138,Neoplasma,62 3,"

2f577aa0758e01c0de34ac84ce9190633d3458b2,A generalized sparse regression model with adjustment of pedigree structure for variant detection from next generation sequencing data,"Next-generation sequencing technologies have been providing more comprehensive descriptions of rare and common sequence variants. Many powerful association tests have been developed for identifying significant individual common variants and genetic regions likely harboring rare and common variants. Single marker tests bear poor statistical powers to identify rare variant associations. Set-based tests sacrifice single marker resolution and require the set size to be much smaller than the sample size. Existing sparse regression algorithms can identify susceptible variants from a large set, even if its size far exceeds the sample size. Such algorithms are developed for analyzing sequence data of unrelated individuals and thus can be invalid in the presence of relatedness. Relatedness and population structure are two ubiquitous confounders in sequencing studies, especially those of admixed minorities. We hereby propose a flexible sparse regression model to jointly rectify relatedness, population structure and traditional covariates. Under this framework, we develop unweighted and weighted Lp (0<p<1) regularization algorithms for selecting a sparse set of susceptible genetic variants. Both the joint adjustment of confounders and the Lp regularizations proved effective for preventing the flow of false positives while maximizing the power to select susceptible genetic variants. Under extensive simulations, our new algorithms outperformed conventional sparse regression algorithms by identifying more causal variants while maintaining lower false discovery rates. In particular, our algorithms appeared to be equally efficient for identifying susceptible rare and common variants. Our algorithms should be useful to a large range of next generation sequencing studies.",2013,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Shaolong Cao"", ids = ""3020658""); list(name = ""Huaizhen Qin"", ids = ""34568447""); list(name = ""Hong-Wen Deng"", ids = ""144156424""); list(name = ""Yu-ping Wang"", ids = ""2679901"")",3d26fcc38426cec5554c2ddd6a1c78c2dad699fa; f546d04dbdc3f7fedac0b8933890cfe664572629,88855bc679d6b94e42b297f37b3decf451cd908e; 232438c322108d36aadc4795f1fd0b541d0cdc72; 562a28153c25625a5d4b4fee7259bcea517df95e; 5173ac55298c25d0b399e06ccda468f7d751a881; 4969afda99c889786496b31a98510e0ccfdd7960; 8066e0b5d6efb3674bc3918770732fe3641d9b42; 8b9cff29b49f65aa8b4b765e09eb8d6daeeee984; 73a8a205a37f0169e89d3f0819a8ec36b39d3d2a; 4d1ce1c69fdf6fd2ba4ec81ce7f0a6df49c6eba9; 88a2f5129a01f5a7b1a2bb4e802d046822f65a39; 43ce6d64704487c81c18b1f3d75aca2fabbaf9aa; 1aa8a6889b73bc5487a40accc64cca1ea18ab0c2; 0a14824290453b95d051ec9cc299d0f61ad82b23; d8f1ffeb7bcad215fcac25b0b0defcbc573d46e3; d50b597c475e87e03e8630e381011cb46e460ad8; 241d361178a593cd6d0f6f5e9659a7b185a62508; 33a2eeb365337b209249dd45f9c8c98fb27411e7; bab8e671423cab53041e3519d128f2c4858d908f; 547789b9229fde8839962a14b6dcb1f19f3563c4; 56cb6fd310b3e8eb52a6d231d8883d05e06bfdcc; d39b66eadb7e504145f25117c5176f20a3e9c5b2; 1fb05f44fa9013902b269a1b68611b19f70c5173; b0cdd840ab8ac9717a8dc69e05c8bd1eb41256e0,,,191
5ad5bf397dd1b87a3005ce58bac06cc5ddcc3e61,"Full-featured, real-time database searching platform enables fast and accurate multiplexed quantitative proteomics","Multiplexed quantitative analyses of complex proteomes enable deep biological insight. While a multitude of workflows have been developed for multiplexed analyses, the most quantitatively accurate method (SPS-MS3) suffers from long acquisition duty cycles. We built a new, real-time database search (RTS) platform, Orbiter, to combat the SPS-MS3 methodâ€™s longer duty cycles. RTS with Orbiter enables the elimination of SPS-MS3 scans if no peptide matches to a given spectrum. With Orbiterâ€™s online proteomic analytical pipeline, which includes RTS and false discovery rate analysis, it was possible to process a single spectrum database search in less than 10 milliseconds. The result is a fast, functional means to identify peptide spectral matches using Comet, filter these matches, and more efficiently quantify proteins of interest. Importantly, the use of Comet for peptide spectral matching allowed for a fully featured search, including analysis of post-translational modifications, with well-known and extensively validated scoring. These data could then be used to trigger subsequent scans in an adaptive and flexible manner. In this work we tested the utility of this adaptive data acquisition platform to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiplexed quantitative experiments. We found that RTS enabled a 2-fold increase in mass spectrometric data acquisition efficiency. Orbiterâ€™s RTS was able to quantify more than 8000 proteins across 10 proteomes in half the time of an SPS-MS3 analysis (18 hours for RTS, 36 hours for SPS-MS3).",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Devin K.

2f7bff4845a108e1804e1908229b0784b2c440dc,Assessing unintended effects of a mammary-specific transgene at the whole animal level in host and non-target animals,"Risk assessment in transgenic plants is intrinsically different than that for transgenic animals; however both require the verification of proper transgene function and in conjunction, an estimate of any unintended effects caused by expression of the transgene. This work was designed to gather data regarding methodologies to detect pleiotropic effects at the whole animal level using a line of transgenic goats that produce the antimicrobial protein human lysozyme (hLZ) in their milk with the goal of using the milk to treat childhood diarrhea. Metabolomics was used to determine the serum metabolite profile of both the host (lactating does) and non-target organism (kid goats raised on control or hLZ milk) prior to weaning (60Â days), at weaning (90Â days) and 1Â month post-weaning (120Â days). In addition, intestinal histology of the kid goats was also carried out. Histological analysis of intestinal segments of the pre-weaning group revealed significantly wider duodenal villi (pÂ =Â 0.014) and significantly longer villi (pÂ =Â 0.028) and deeper crypts (pÂ =Â 0.030) in the ileum of kid goats consuming hLZ milk. Serum metabolomics was capable of detecting differences over time but revealed no significant differences in metabolites between control and hLZ fed kids after correction for false discovery rate. Serum metabolomics of control or hLZ lactating does showed only one significant difference in an unknown metabolite (qÂ =Â 0.0422). The results as a whole indicate that consumption of hLZ milk results in positive or insignificant intestinal morphology and metabolic changes.

7b6f3a808383d52d2c0c42f65d39383f9ff32c7a,Nonspecific Effect of Stress on Brain Gray Matter Volume in Drug-naive Female Patients with First Depressive Episode,"BACKGROUND
This study aimed to observe the differences in brain gray matter volume in drug-naive female patients after the first episode of major depression with and without stressful life events (SLEs) before the onset of depression.


METHODS
Forty-three drug-naive female patients voluntarily participated in the present study after the first major depressive episode. The life event scale was used to evaluate the severity of the impact of SLEs during 6 months before the onset of the major depressive episode. High-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained, and the VBM and SPM8 software process were used to process and analyze the MRI.


RESULTS
Compared to that in patients without SLEs, the volume of brain gray matter was lower in the bilateral temporal lobe, right occipital lobe, and right limbic lobe in the SLE group. However, the gray matter volume did not differ significantly between the two groups after the application of false discovery rate (FDR) correction.


CONCLUSIONS
Although the results of the present study suggest the absence of significant differences in brain gray matter volume between female drug-naive patients after the first episode of major depression with and without SLEs after FDR correction, the study provides useful information for exploring the definitive role of stress in the onset of depression.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Chuanjun Zhuo"", ids = ""40403322""); list(name = ""Haiman Bian"", ids = ""7568638""); list(name = ""Yan-jie Gao"", ids = ""8128515""); list(name = ""Xiao-Lei Ma"", ids = ""50088044""); list(name = ""Shengzhang Ji"", ids = ""4553805""); list(name = ""Meng-Yuan Yao"", ids = ""4427532""); list(name = ""Ning Zhai"", ids = ""120693475""); list(name = ""Xin-hai Sun"", ids = ""4363912""); list(name = ""Xiao-yan Ma"", ids = ""2486412""); list(name = ""Hong-jun Tian"", ids = ""72309238""); list(name = ""Gong-ying Li"", ids = ""7230032"")",05e1086bb8b76f2508eb59c0c0b3b4194f9fb0c3,b0d77562d91d84eaab1a836ee7b9dffa595ff6d3; 26c1f93708ec52d891af7ad7d8b5ee11c2256746; b342b76dc5b699a3a4fef977427e9d7ddd10fa1b; 71788a0c3e239c36c59a06f5e78df2d729dc7b25; c5dedb1a23afb455e48fc1deda6a1b644395f7c4; 6559e332eda930000655b0c39e112914869385e6; 326e840c2873ae7528ec79c3a411952b4fc2db62; 7447e6508c4e014e157350f4048a17253eebbe55; 678d895007dd7ccce1422056be567af7590b5dee; 50936b7a433ef130cb07a6e536b994736c27cb05; d7ebef41794870ebcccd8ff1e647fa72871932d6; 6f9d341c516a9123cc4534bda0e081676a3d0c27; 2ea1f4517ebf96e744403057f070e02a40d0e36c; fd43cb346483e5ae15006b5939195b61f8a48814,Chinese Medical Journal,129,279 - 283
97bb9430ab4f8dbb23a799fe7fa01249117b8886,PPAR signaling pathway may be an important predictor of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"PurposeNeoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer may improve the radicality for a subset of patients, but others may suffer from severe adverse drug reactions without any benefit. To predict the responses to chemotherapy, we performed a phase II trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a weekly PCb [paclitaxel (Taxol) plus carboplatin] regimen for stage II/III breast cancer and assessed the correlation between baseline gene expression and the tumor response to treatment.MethodsA total of 61 patients with stage II-III breast cancer were included and administered four cycles of preoperative PCb. We performed a gene expression analysis using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays in 31 breast cancer tissues. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) program using a false discovery rate of 0.05. The Functional Annotation Tool in the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources was used to perform the gene functional enrichment analysis. The other 30 patients (15 pCR and 15 non-pCR patients) were available as an independent validation set to test the selected DEGs by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR).ResultsBy analyzing six pathological complete response (pCR) patients and 25 patients with non-pCR, 300 probes (231 genes) were identified as differentially expressed between pCR and residual disease by the SAM program when the fold change was >2. The gene functional enrichment analysis revealed 15 prominent gene categories that were different between pCR and non-pCR patients, most notably the genes involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), DNA repair and ER signal pathways and in the immune-related gene cluster. The qRT-PCR analysis results for the genes in the PPAR pathway (LPL, SORBS1, PLTP, SCD5, MMP1 and CSTA) in independent validation set were consistent with the results from the microarray data analysis.ConclusionIn the present study, we identified a number of gene categories pertinent to the therapeutic response.

a2bd03c16d262822135a7940ac9ecab0328a59e3,Molecular basis of the chemoprotective effect of white button mushrooms against breast cancer,"1580 An abnormal expression of aromatase in breast tissue is considered to be a risk factor for breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors have been shown to be effective drugs in treating hormone-dependent breast cancer and potentially useful in preventing this cancer in postmenopausal women. Based on our results, we hypothesize that postmenopausal women can benefit from a diet that includes white button mushrooms (species Agaricus bisporus), a common vegetable, since they contain phytochemicals that have been shown to be effective aromatase inhibitors. To better understand the cancer protective effects of mushrooms, our laboratory has investigated the in vivo action of mushroom extract. Three sets of animal experiments have been conducted and the results suggest that the oral intake of mushroom extracts might slow MCF-7aro-derived tumor growth in nude mice. MCF-7aro is an ER-positive/aromatase-positive breast cancer cell line and demonstrates increased cell proliferation in the presence of testosterone. While it is exciting to find that mushroom extract contains anti-aromatase chemicals, it is reasonable to think that mushroom chemicals also affect other cellular pathways. As the first step, we have performed gene expression microarray analysis on MCF-7aro tumors from the mushroom-fed animals and those from the control animals. It was our goal to identify additional gene targets whose expression could also be modulated by the mushroom diet. We have performed the analysis using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A among three biological replicates, i.e., RNAs were isolated tumors from three individual animals and analyzed separately. The intensities of the probe signals on GeneChips were statistically normalized following a background noise subtraction, and were analyzed using algorithms in R/Bioconductor. We compared more than 22,000 gene expressions using two-sample t-tests and applied the Benjamini-Yekutieli p-value correction to control the false discovery rate. Using a minimum fold change criteria of 1.2 and an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05, we identified 515 genes that were up-regulated, and 1805 genes that were down-regulated in tumors from mushroom-fed mice versus those from control mice. The results indicate that a higher percentage of signal transduction genes are up-regulated and a higher percentage of genes involved in DNA processing and transcription/translation are down-regulated in tumors from mushroom-fed mice versus those from control mice. A careful evaluation of the results from microarray analysis will yield novel insights into the mechanisms as well as important signal-transduction pathways regulated by the phytochemicals in white button mushrooms.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Sharon Kwok"", ids = ""31500467""); list(name = ""Y Yuan"", ids = ""89090721""); list(name = ""Kimberly Karlsberg"", ids = ""14259329""); list(name = ""David Smith"", ids = ""48898739""); list(name = ""Sheryl Phung"", ids = ""32303767""); list(name = ""Shiuan Chen"", ids = ""90339687"")",,,Cancer Research,65,370-371
5ef72f9cd0514184bb90cf341d7210e72d465cb5,Development of a cDNA microarray of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot and its use in understanding the early stage of underwater adhesion.,"The underwater adhesion of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) to substrates is a complex process that is controlled by a delicate apparatus, the byssus. As a critical activity of the byssus glands embedded in the zebra mussel feet, byssogenesis is highly active to produce numerous byssal threads from the settled juvenile stage through the adult stage in its life cycle. This lifelong activity helps the zebra mussel to firmly attach to substrata underwater, thereby causing severe economic and ecologic impacts. In an attempt to better understand the zebra mussel's byssus activity, a cDNA microarray (ZMB) including 716 genes, generated from a Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) cDNA library, was printed and used for the comparison of gene expression during zebra mussel adhesion and non-adhesion. To better understand the byssogenesis mechanism, RNA samples from the zebra mussel feet with byssogenesis and without byssogenesis were used in a two-color hybridization to reveal the gene differential expression in the two states. Based on the P values (P<0.05), Fifty-two ESTs were found as differentially expressed genes and were divided into two groups, upregulated and downregulated groups according to there logFC values. With the false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment, seven were identified from the upregulated group and nine from the downregulated group. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the four excretory gland peptide-like protein (EGP) encoding genes in upregulated group are structurally different than the two in the downregulated list. The amino acid composition analysis on the proteins, which were encoded by the up- or downregulated ESTs without homologues (NH) suggested that seven of the NH proteins are biochemically similar to the novel foot proteins from other mussels. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (QRT-PCR) proved the uniqueness of the templates in the array, and also confirmed the differentially expressed genes identified by microarray experiment. Our findings demonstrated that the zebra mussel byssus cDNA microarray is an efficient tool for the studies of differential gene expression in different byssogenesis states, thereby revealing important details of the underwater adhesion.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Wei Xu"", ids = ""48721504""); list(name = ""Mohamed Faisal"", ids = ""145487402"")",782b4b50c16181f7842f6a9de1e4c062045a45bc; 2fcb645efe411dbb91f9371ba5f075eda3206aa5; f84d2e1e875027c025cf3c81bed4016477599832; 8520a66678cd47efdfe2615ae9692f4df22edb77; 052a2a8b2b4bf8fbed9b8e0dc711510d9489f6ad; 95eb5787d5925f491676d422bb6f66103c0431d0; 1898de819c4c23b40ed81093c0355d0b9da87544; 8ea48a8adb6613cbbd09677d0f0d02fdabd504cb; ae5a41e270e8a49ccedef1338b9720c60c03795b; 8fc12d3f68b5f1d0ac9ea2b8b851453f3255150b; 2bb1e78af308478270d7700bb34b9f924a98d006; c09595342381eb365ca3d2b9121cc89b5f3cc014; 8255d743e47ba706d3cfe09a34c7a25fffd38559,15cba8f9df20c9bddf39f909f85869494d2d510a; bc92696de16ab1d160d7a39457009375132fdea5; bfde4003fea73029d2f5e67ad3feac27f7e4cc67; f604371d239715ca28c59db69e23432d71d4f381; 582d27e91cec0435b933b2476a6a8609df0f4b29; f6b94146ec523b0f631600b7c56e72a505a3be93; ead5e36842221ea924c914a894aafafa6279db8f; 6b4970021779fe9e15f2fc14fc06ead739deb180; fd81a2234d4818c8ca047c2b15f4dc8e31c820a4; ed47385ff3f536874052b6894998b87e36a6c2a8; 2f1c08eba4cf2bfd627d3ee2380b2a7aa0fe61b2; fdba5cddc791e5042db15b77ac40d8a2678eefb1; 44330c6ec8eb3ceae599b150e9c9124d15661009; ce4b6b8e20c74d45d8c2d22eba7a02edc7288b14; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; 9cfe3ab53603eeafd82b9140240b439af2b0e950; 0101eb520239b61e071823c56e2b3f47724ac7e4; 847eab3db971b86aa434f2a60ffeef7317be5d42; fdcf73ee9e361ba0c28be0bb7f225e960c9f949e; 11c1e56360f1e71e97d1d5205fcc6842bb2437ae; 1c405ce3655515312cba508f6e8bb8c904d23d25; 31808841c195a1a1115c65a6659528de542d13fe; e7c8aa2cb2223f17615c1b1ae3b33095466e95cc; 76c204b6735fff015660702efa606fea61ad2245; 9b2308f9f02812bae798b04936e780571d44c67b; 370106d9fee2ab98ba0951747606a48cca6b4741; b3e8692d191f0db75bdd8252e8e94901d05242b9; c042706a15b257e5cc37f33366b11185a48d7e31; 2d6f573c36c5e2153b65859fb080523fc4d842d0; d172cd22d2115580bbb3cb23604174ceed608f3f; 241ad6f851c9918d1092593a0e201b85e7a34438; 5de17ab79eca66ee91f9ae248f38c3a9e1c7c277; c7f05bdb65cfa85f0cdb03eb17276d623c612f05,Gene,436 1-2,"

409839bd226e8e38b7f230a9cb2e36922b904cd3,Cadmium-associated differential methylation throughout the placental genome: epigenome-wide association study of two US birth cohorts,"Background Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous toxicant that during pregnancy can impair fetal development. Cd sequesters in the placenta where it can impair placental function, impacting fetal development. We aimed to investigate Cd-associated variations in placental DNA methylation (DNAM), associations with gene expression, and identify novel pathways involved in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. Methods Using placental DNAM and Cd concentrations in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS, n=343) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS, n=141), we performed an EWAS between Cd and DNAM, adjusting for tissue heterogeneity using a reference-free method. Cohort-specific results were aggregated via inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis, and variably methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We then performed functional enrichment analysis and tests for associations between gene expression and birth metrics. Results We identified 17 Cd-associated differentially methylated CpG sites with meta-analysis p-values < 1e-05, two of which were within a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Methylation levels at 9 of the 17 loci were associated with increased expression of 6 genes (5% FDR): TNFAIP2, EXOC3L4, GAS7, SREBF1, ACOT7, and RORA. Higher placental expression of TNFAIP2 and ACOT7, and lower expression of RORA, were associated with lower birth weight z-scores (p-values < 0.05). Conclusion Cd associated differential DNAM and corresponding DNAM-expression associations at these loci are involved in inflammatory signaling and cell growth. The expression levels of genes involved in inflammatory signaling (TNFAIP2, ACOT7, and RORA), were also associated with birth metrics, suggesting a role for inflammatory processes in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. Significance Cadmium is a toxic environmental pollutant that can impair fetal development. The mechanisms underlying this toxicity are unclear, though disrupted placental functions could play an important role. In this study we examined associations between cadmium concentrations and DNA methylation throughout the placental genome, across two US birth cohorts. We observed cadmium-associated differential methylation, and corresponding methylation-expression associations at genes involved in cellular growth processes and/or immune and inflammatory signaling. This study provides supporting evidence that disrupted placental epigenetic regulation of cellular growth and immune/inflammatory signaling could play a role in cadmium associated reproductive toxicity in human pregnancies.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Todd M.

c0d331d7f806d89dddb71a177ee37792f2ae7c01,LSPR: an integrated periodicity detection algorithm for unevenly sampled temporal microarray data,"UNLABELLED
We propose a three-step periodicity detection algorithm named LSPR. Our method first preprocesses the raw time-series by removing the linear trend and filtering noise. In the second step, LSPR employs a Lomb-Scargle periodogram to estimate the periodicity in the time-series. Finally, harmonic regression is applied to model the cyclic components. Inferred periodic transcripts are selected by a false discovery rate procedure. We have applied LSPR to unevenly sampled synthetic data and two Arabidopsis diurnal expression datasets, and compared its performance with the existing well-established algorithms.

bd21264e85edf2272455a2e85564ca7233b84dbf,Detecting the Baryons in Matter Power Spectra,"We examine power spectra from the Abell/ACO rich cluster survey and the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) for observational evidence of features produced by the baryons. A nonnegligible baryon fraction produces relatively sharp oscillatory features at specific wavenumbers in the matter power spectrum. However, the mere existence of baryons will also produce a global suppression of the power spectrum. We look for both of these features using the false discovery rate statistic. We show that the window effects on the Abell/ACO power spectrum are minimal, which has allowed for the discovery of discrete oscillatory features in the power spectrum. On the other hand, there are no statistically significant oscillatory features in the 2dFGRS power spectrum, which is expected from the survey's broad window function. After accounting for window effects we apply a scale-independent bias to the 2dFGRS power spectrum, PAbell(k) = b2P2dF(k) and b = 3.2. We find that the overall shapes of the Abell/ACO and the biased 2dFGRS power spectra are entirely consistent over the range 0.02 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 0.15 h Mpc-1. We examine the range of Î©matter and baryon fraction, for which these surveys could detect significant suppression in power. The reported baryon fractions for both the Abell/ACO and 2dFGRS surveys are high enough to cause a detectable suppression in power (after accounting for errors, windows, and k-space sampling). Using the same technique, we also examine, given the best-fit baryon density obtained from big bang nucleosynthesis, whether it is possible to detect additional suppression due to dark matter-baryon interaction. We find that the limit on dark matter cross section/mass derived from these surveys is the same as those ruled out in a recent study by Chen, Hannestad, & Scherrer.",2002,Physics,"list(name = ""Christopher J.

This type of inductive knowledge provides monitoring systems with valuable real time predictive capabilities. By obtaining this knowledge, system and network administrators can anticipate and prevent failures. 
 
In this paper we present a prediction module for the monitoring software Osmius (www.osmius.net). Osmius has been developed by Peopleware (peopleware.es) under GPL licence. We have extended the Osmius database to store the knowledge we obtain from the algorithms in a highly parametrized way. Thus system administrators can apply the most appropriate settings for each system. 
 
Results are presented in terms of positive predictive values and false discovery rates over a huge event database. They confirm that these pattern mining processes will provide network monitoring systems with accurate real time predictive capabilities.",2010,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Rafael GarcÃ­a"", ids = ""145118818""); list(name = ""Luis Llana"", ids = ""144341192""); list(name = ""Constantino MalagÃ³n"", ids = ""38243305""); list(name = ""JesÃºs Pancorbo"", ids = ""1803607"")",,,,,632-642
ef20bc4cd860d1a398c1ff03a8c075d10cd2ea95,Analysis of oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures using mixed models,"BackgroundTwo or more factor mixed factorial experiments are becoming increasingly common in microarray data analysis. In this case study, the two factors are presence (Patients with Alzheimer's disease) or absence (Control) of the disease, and brain regions including olfactory bulb (OB) or cerebellum (CER). In the design considered in this manuscript, OB and CER are repeated measurements from the same subject and, hence, are correlated. It is critical to identify sources of variability in the analysis of oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures and correlations among data points have to be considered. In addition, multiple testing problems are more complicated in experiments with multi-level treatments or treatment combinations.ResultsIn this study we adopted a linear mixed model to analyze oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures. We first construct a generalized F test to select differentially expressed genes. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% was applied to the P values of the generalized F test. For those genes with significant generalized F test, we then categorize them based on whether the interaction terms were significant or not at the Î±-level (Î±new= 0.0033) determined by the FDR procedure. Since simple effects may be examined for the genes with significant interaction effect, we adopt the protected Fisher's least significant difference test (LSD) procedure at the level of Î±newto control the family-wise error rate (FWER) for each gene examined.ConclusionsA linear mixed model is appropriate for analysis of oligonucleotide array experiments with repeated measures. We constructed a generalized F test to select differentially expressed genes, and then applied a specific sequence of tests to identify factorial effects.

3a52dee24ce2da1e01c4ae709ed0d5b6e51082fc,Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis for diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus,"BackgroundDiabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus and is associated with considerable morbidity and high mortality. There is increasing evidence to suggest that dysregulation of the epigenome is involved in diabetic nephropathy. We assessed whether epigenetic modification of DNA methylation is associated with diabetic nephropathy in a case-control study of 192 Irish patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). Cases had T1D and nephropathy whereas controls had T1D but no evidence of renal disease.MethodsWe performed DNA methylation profiling in bisulphite converted DNA from cases and controls using the recently developed Illumina InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, that enables the direct investigation of 27,578 individual cytosines at CpG loci throughout the genome, which are focused on the promoter regions of 14,495 genes.ResultsSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis indicated that significant components of DNA methylation variation correlated with patient age, time to onset of diabetic nephropathy, and sex. Adjusting for confounding factors using multivariate Cox-regression analyses, and with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05, we observed 19 CpG sites that demonstrated correlations with time to development of diabetic nephropathy. Of note, this included one CpG site located 18 bp upstream of the transcription start site of UNC13B, a gene in which the first intronic SNP rs13293564 has recently been reported to be associated with diabetic nephropathy.ConclusionThis high throughput platform was able to successfully interrogate the methylation state of individual cytosines and identified 19 prospective CpG sites associated with risk of diabetic nephropathy. These differences in DNA methylation are worthy of further follow-up in replication studies using larger cohorts of diabetic patients with and without nephropathy.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Christopher G.

Wnt pathways control key biological processes that potentially impact on tumor progression and patient survival. We aimed to evaluate DNA methylation at promoter CpG islands (CGI) of Wnt pathway genes in ovarian tumors at presentation and identify biomarkers of patient progression-free survival (PFS).


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Epithelial ovarian tumors (screening study n = 120, validation study n = 61), prospectively collected through a cohort study, were analyzed by differential methylation hybridization at 302 loci spanning 189 promoter CGIs at 137 genes in Wnt pathways. The association of methylation and PFS was examined by Cox proportional hazards model.


RESULTS
DNA methylation is associated with PFS at 20 of 302 loci (P < 0.05, n = 111), with 5 loci significant at false discovery rate (FDR) less than 10%. A total of 11 of 20 loci retain significance in an independent validation cohort (n = 48, P â‰¤ 0.05, FDR â‰¤ 10%), and 7 of these loci, at FZD4, DVL1, NFATC3, ROCK1, LRP5, AXIN1, and NKD1 genes, are independent from clinical parameters (adjusted P < 0.05). Increased methylation at these loci associates with increased hazard of disease progression. A multivariate Cox model incorporates only NKD1 and DVL1, identifying two groups differing in PFS [HR = 2.09; 95% CI (1.39-3.15); permutation test P < 0.005]. Methylation at DVL1 and NFATC3 show significant association with response. Consistent with their epigenetic regulation, reduced expression of FZD4, DVL1, and ROCK1 is an indicator of early-disease relapse in an independent ovarian tumor cohort (n = 311, adjusted P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
The data highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation of multiple promoter CGIs of Wnt pathway genes in ovarian cancer and identify methylation at NKD1 and DVL1 as independent predictors of PFS.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Wei Dai"", ids = ""143716167""); list(name = ""Jens M.

7699243f0d7514ca164e1f15e0560bfc524ee677,MicroRNA expression profiling of the human uterine cervix after term labor and delivery.,"OBJECTIVE
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. The objective of this study was to determine the miRNA expression profile of the human uterine cervix after spontaneous term labor (TL).


STUDY DESIGN
The miRNA expression pattern of cervical tissue was characterized using microarrays. Samples were collected at term from patients with (n = 8) and without (n = 9) TL. Moderated t tests and false discovery rate correction were applied. Results were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
A total of 226 miRNAs were expressed in human cervical tissue. miR-223, miR-34b, and miR-34c were overexpressed in cervical tissue of patients with TL compared to those without. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays confirmed these findings (miR-223 [fold change {FC} = 5.7], miR-34b [FC = 4.5], miR-34c [FC = 6.2]; P < .001).


CONCLUSION
This is the first report of miRNA expression in the human uterine cervix in pregnancy. Cervical remodeling after TL and delivery was associated with changes in miR-223, miR-34b, and miR-34c.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sonia S.

f9084c9b61156a3ca6a5a6f8965a38bd7f0df980,A constrained polynomial regression procedure for estimating the local False Discovery Rate,"BackgroundIn the context of genomic association studies, for which a large number of statistical tests are performed simultaneously, the local False Discovery Rate (lFDR), which quantifies the evidence of a specific gene association with a clinical or biological variable of interest, is a relevant criterion for taking into account the multiple testing problem. The lFDR not only allows an inference to be made for each gene through its specific value, but also an estimate of Benjamini-Hochberg's False Discovery Rate (FDR) for subsets of genes.ResultsIn the framework of estimating procedures without any distributional assumption under the alternative hypothesis, a new and efficient procedure for estimating the lFDR is described. The results of a simulation study indicated good performances for the proposed estimator in comparison to four published ones. The five different procedures were applied to real datasets.ConclusionA novel and efficient procedure for estimating lFDR was developed and evaluated.",2006,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Cyril Dalmasso"", ids = ""4379542""); list(name = ""Avner Bar-Hen"", ids = ""1398163979""); list(name = ""Philippe BroÃ«t"", ids = ""3170825"")",4bd46647b4dd58e8ea0878f6074b89ef63eba2d0; 0ef43f2f30d1ae589d759f7c068d6f9382e742af; c255915ec4726ae29493a5b1be87c97030e0d43a; 66c44743ef3148e7a1e5a2b8f8ea2b1b122dd7a8; 96401004ad3ab64af3482d575ae25598913f5ce3; f89a0fd8073c0ad35ce3cd3749627aad416737cd; 289355a54eee1fad98471f32105823cb059a5b76,e2a187c6ec22b531a438bfa65b679b9a1a87597d; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; bf29dcd92f0f6b650196c8d8351fd0ef91e7701b; 422adc24881a92ba1d934dc7bc1b686764e6336e; 1a0efda6a3e104a4cafb4e64805e53c754a403dc; 845fe4dde82853a8e4fcf8330a6e85daaa2cb318; d65ab6603658382103f1883c30fc0dea849667fb; a5b76fa17917a8a2d07687e064c327a3056910a4; 7be801da3bb1274cd75faeef551a30473144c4be; 9393721879cae0d9becd88aa9392800ec71dd005; 2def5ea8b905c5742e989279f14bab82e560a07e; 1d5b3054f267584dc5a730e9e3754b682d7888b8; 9f13bcb1b644ee861e02c1046c04c197ad809f3f; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 93dd1ad905da7b09568aaf7d04c3d325772d42fc; fd4b45dcbdca97567ef0b0a085824a5044d884d4; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; 68232dd7ebbcb8a58072be064b211f9a098508bb; d3950396051b4b7dee4d5d9f3c10191f9e5c8b8f; 73d6948a5fb62bd8c3fbbd612b1064003bcb2222; df402aea66043c2ebc68293183e09f6e60a92626,BMC Bioinformatics,8,229 - 229
a8531054687d4e09dea8dd6dc2a5e679f8921e6c,Identification of a molecular signature in human type 1 diabetes mellitus using serum and functional genomics.,"Understanding active proinflammatory mechanisms at and before type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) onset is hindered in humans, given that the relevant tissues are inaccessible and pancreatic immune responses are difficult to measure in the periphery by traditional approaches. Therefore, we investigated the use of a sensitive and comprehensive genomics strategy to investigate the presence of proinflammatory factors in serum. The sera of recent onset diabetes patients (n = 15, 12 possessing and 3 lacking islet cell autoantibodies), long-standing diabetes patients (n = 12), ""at risk"" siblings of diabetes patients (n = 9), and healthy controls (n = 12) were used to induce gene expression in unrelated, healthy PBMC. After culture, gene expression was measured with microarrays and normalized expression data were subjected to hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling. All recent onset sera induced an expression signature (192 UniGenes; fold change: >1.5, p < 0.01; false discovery rate: <0.01) that included IL-1 cytokine family members and chemokines involved in monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil chemotaxis, as well as numerous receptors and signaling molecules. This molecular signature was not induced with the sera of healthy controls or long standing diabetes patients, where longitudinal analysis of ""at risk"" siblings (n = 3) before and after onset support the hypothesis that the signature emerges years before onset. This study supports prior investigations of serum that reflect disease processes associated with progression to T1DM. Identification of unique inflammatory mediators may improve disease prediction beyond current islet autoantibodies. Furthermore, proinflammatory serum markers may be used as inclusion criteria or endpoint measures in clinical trials aimed at preventing T1DM.",2008,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xujing Wang"", ids = ""1804225""); list(name = ""Shuang Jia"", ids = ""46633274""); list(name = ""Rhonda Geoffrey"", ids = ""144862836""); list(name = ""Ramin Alemzadeh"", ids = ""6372126""); list(name = ""Soumitra Ghosh"", ids = ""48359803""); list(name = ""Martin J.

6a28c5ee66acfba23a14fb2bd8a80bc6bfac10de,Founder effects and related issues in Host-viral association studies,"Viruses such as HIV which replicate rapidly and with high transcription error rates may evade immune detection by mutating at key positions within the viral amino acid sequence. Large-scale host-viral association studies are conducted to identify positions of possible escape mutation in response to host immune pressure, with this pressure predominantly governed by genes within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. When transmission of the virus is HLA-associated, however, standard tests of association can be confounded by the relatedness of contemporarily circulating viral sequences, as sequences descended from a common ancestor may share inherited patterns of polymorphisms, termed â€žfounder effectsâ€Ÿ. A number of model-based methods utilizing inferred phylogenetic trees estimated from the observed viral sequences have been proposed to correct for this confounding, although such methods are typically computationally intensive and require specialist software for their implementation. In this thesis we propose an alternative empirical approach based on principal components analysis (PCA) which can be implemented using widely available software, and which adapts and extends methods currently used to control for population stratification in case-control genome-wide association studies. To accommodate data with small proportions commonly observed in host-viral studies we implement the PCA-based controlling procedure within a logistic regression framework using novel formulations motivated by the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem and demonstrate their utility in detecting true associations whilst minimizing confounding generated by founder effects via simulation. The approach is then extended to the multivariate setting through the adaptation of well-known techniques which expand the scope of host-viral analyses by accommodating possible linkages within the HLA and viral data. 
 
The thesis concludes with a discussion of issues arising from the application of tail-based rejection regions and false discovery rates in large-scale analyses based on pooled contingency tables with varying margins. We argue that constraints imposed by the margins have implications overlooked in the rigid application of techniques developed for tests based on statistics with continuous distributions, but by leveraging the scale of such analyses it may be possible to consider local deviations between observed and expected p-value distributions to better identify hypotheses of interest.",2013,Biology,"list(name = ""Karyn Reeves"", ids = ""143731546"")",,d7e1b210072a9b08c30a20fe64e5d4ae3cecbadb;

The purpose of this study was to determine if a mixed flavonoid-fish oil supplement (Q-Mix; 1000 mg quercetin, 400 mg isoquercetin, 120 mg epigallocatechin (EGCG) from green tea extract, 400 mg n3-PUFAs (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) (220 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 180 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) from fish oil, 1000 mg vitamin C, 40 mg niacinamide, and 800 Âµg folic acid) would reduce complications associated with obesity; that is, reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and alter genomic profiles in overweight women. Overweight and obese women (n = 48; age = 40-70 years) were assigned to Q-Mix or placebo groups using randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled procedures. Overnight fasted blood samples were collected at 0 and 10 weeks and analyzed for cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), Fâ‚‚-isoprostanes, and whole-blood-derived mRNA, which was assessed using Affymetrix HuGene-1_1 ST arrays. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA models for blood analytes and gene expression and pathway and network enrichment methods for gene expression. Plasma levels increased with Q-Mix supplementation by 388% for quercetin, 95% for EPA, 18% for DHA, and 20% for docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). Q-Mix did not alter plasma levels for CRP (p = 0.268), F2-isoprostanes (p = 0.273), and cytokines (p > 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of pathways in Q-Mix vs. placebo related to interferon-induced antiviral mechanism (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.001). Overrepresentation analysis further disclosed an inhibition of phagocytosis-related inflammatory pathways in Q-Mix vs. placebo. Thus, a 10-week Q-Mix supplementation elicited a significant rise in plasma quercetin, EPA, DHA, and DPA, as well as stimulated an antiviral and inflammation whole-blood transcriptomic response in overweight women.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Lynn Cialdella-Kam"", ids = ""102033377""); list(name = ""David C Nieman"", ids = ""5972652""); list(name = ""Amy M.

be927921389012b921dde361abaea1915c9388c5,"A peptide-spectrum scoring system based on ion alignment, intensity, and pair probabilities.","Peppy, the proteogenomic/proteomic search software, employs a novel method for assessing the match quality between an MS/MS spectrum and a theorized peptide sequence. The scoring system uses three score factors calculated with binomial probabilities: the probability that a fragment ion will randomly align with a peptide ion, the probability that the aligning ions will be selected from subsets of the most intense peaks, and the probability that the intensities of fragment ions identified as y-ions are greater than those of their counterpart b-ions. The scores produced by the method act as global confidence scores, which facilitate the accurate comparison of results and the estimation of false discovery rates. Peppy has been integrated into the meta-search engine PepArML to produce meaningful comparisons with Mascot, MSGF+, OMSSA, X!Tandem, k-Score and s-Score.

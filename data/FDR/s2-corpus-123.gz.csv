Here, we aimed to identify novel NSCLC subtypes based on genome-wide methylation data, assess their relationship with smoking behaviour, age, COPD, emphysema and tumour histopathology, and identify the molecular pathways underlying each subtype. Methods Methylation profiling was performed on 49 pairs of tumour and adjacent lung tissue using Illumina 450â€…K arrays. Transcriptome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000 and validated using expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Tumour immune cell infiltration was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of tumour methylation data revealed two subgroups characterised by a significant association between cluster membership and presence of COPD (p=0.024).

However, responses are heterogeneous and resistance to therapy is a pressing clinical problem. With the goal of developing liquid biomarkers to aid in treatment selection, we sought to identify genes associated with resistance to chemotherapy using a circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based approach. METHODS: Whole blood (~5mL) was obtained from 25 patients with mCRPC starting docetaxel (n1â„421) or cabazitaxel (n1â„44). CTCs were isolated using anti-EpCAM-conjugated magnetic beads, and following cell lysis, mRNA was extracted followed by multiplex qRTPCR for 44 prostate cancer-related genes plus internal controls. Gene expression was normalized to controls, and samples were considered CTC-positive based on a previously established set of epithelial markers (EpCAM, EGFR, DSG2, KRT8, KRT18 and KRT19). The primary endpoint was PSA progression-free survival (PFS), with PSA progression defined as an increase of 25% or more above the nadir. Univariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess for genes associated with PFS at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.20. RESULTS: Among 25 patients with mCRPC, we identified 84% (21/25) with detectable CTCs. The median age of the cohort was 62 years (IQR 58-70). At a median (IQR) follow up of 5.4 (3.4-9.3) months, 47.6 % (10/21) of patients showed a PSA decrease of at least 30% following treatment initiation. 18/21 patients (85.7%) experienced PSA progression at a median of 2.8 months (IQR 1.7-4.8). In the Cox analysis, KLK2 (HR 2.54, 95%CI 1.24-5.21, p1â„40.011), GAS6 (HR 3.50, 95% CI 1.30-9.42, p1â„40.013), and BMP7 (HR 2.01, 95%CI 1.15-3.52; p1â„40.014) were associated with shorter PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Wehave identified three genes associatedwith progression in mCRPC patients initiating chemotherapy. While these early results need further confirmation, they suggest that CTCs may be utilized to help guide precision-based treatment strategies in patients with mCRPC. Additionally, these results corroborate our recent in vitro and in vivo findings (Lee et al, J Cell Biochem, 2016) indicating that GAS6 protects prostate cancer cells from docetaxel-induced apoptosis.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jae-Seung Chung"", ids = ""12696886""); list(name = ""Yugang Wang"", ids = ""46394549""); list(name = ""Henderson James"", ids = ""153349188""); list(name = ""Udit Singhal*"", ids = ""48061811""); list(name = ""Yuanyuan Qiao"", ids = ""48549343""); list(name = ""Alexander Zaslavsky"", ids = ""47121304""); list(name = ""Dan Hovelson"", ids = ""152906652""); list(name = ""Felix Yi-Chung Feng"", ids = ""2191116""); list(name = ""Ganesh S.

Purpose The aim of this study is to develop a multigene predictor of pathologic complete response (pCR) to sequential ECD primary chemotherapy for localized breast cancer in a French prospective multicentre trial (including 340 pts) and to compare this gene signature with previously published prognostic or predictive gene signatures. Patients and Methods The first 170 patients from the planed interim analysis underwent core biopsy to obtain RNA from the tumor for transcriptional profiling using Affymetrix U133Plus 2.0 arrays: 159 core biopsies were available. Of 146 with â‰¥30 % tumor cells and among them 100 (70%) gave high quality RNA for transcriptome analysis [RIN â‰¥7]. The sampling was representative of the whole population. Arrays were normalized by a new version of the GCRMA [Wu, 2004] and non-hybridized probesets were filtered out. Exploratory analysis of transcriptomic data were performed using hierarchical clustering and PCA. Statistical analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. Moreover SAM [Tusher, 2000] was used to detect differentially expressed genes. Multivariate analysis were applied on the selected subset of probesets using the logistic regression model. Finally, pathways of interest were highlighted by Gene Set Analysis (GSA) [Efron & Tibshirani, 2006]. Results Among the first 170 first patients, a pCR was observed in 13% HER2-negative or HER2-positive patients not receiving neoadjuvant trastuzumab and in 30% of HER2 positive patients treated with trastuzumab. Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed the predictive value of classical variables (ER, grade) on pCR. Unsupervised gene expression array profiling identified triple-negative subtype as a separate subgroup. Using SAM analysis with a FDR (false discovery rate) of 5%, 216 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in the different pCR categories. Logistic regression analysis identified four genes as a valuable predictor of pCR rate. The statistical properties of a single score derived from the model will be discussed in the presentation (specificity, sensitivity, validation..). Among the genes highlighted by our study, we retrieved genes reported in other signatures (Hess, 2006, Van de Vijver, 2002). Conclusions This study provides a highly sensitive and specific gene profile able to identify a subgroup of patients with 70% pCR rates after primary ECD chemotherapy regimen. Confirmatory study will be performed on the second cohort of 170 patients. Major genes identified in this signature will be further validated using quantitative RT-PCR.",2008,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sabrina Carpentier"", ids = ""144793257""); list(name = ""Fabien Valet"", ids = ""4083025""); list(name = ""Charles Decraene"", ids = ""48811628""); list(name = ""FrÃ©dÃ©rique Spyratos"", ids = ""3874146""); list(name = ""Patricia de CrÃ©moux"", ids = ""11347637""); list(name = ""Jean Philippe Meyniel"", ids = ""35491226""); list(name = ""VÃ©ronique Scott"", ids = ""50154784""); list(name = ""Jacqueline Lehmann-Che"", ids = ""1404814045""); list(name = ""Brigitte Sigal"", ids = ""32330338""); list(name = ""Marie-Christine Mathieu"", ids = ""143750178""); list(name = ""Philippe Bertheau"", ids = ""49186184""); list(name = ""Jean Marc Guinebretriere"", ids = ""83495285""); list(name = ""Jean-Yves Pierga"", ids = ""48997507""); list(name = ""Suzette Delaloge"", ids = ""4786173""); list(name = ""Etienne Brain"", ids = ""50598381""); list(name = ""Michel Marty"", ids = ""49042908""); list(name = ""Sergio RomÃ¡n-RomÃ¡n"", ids = ""1399264312""); list(name = ""Bernard Asselain"", ids = ""144273042""); list(name = ""Emmanuel Barillot"", ids = ""46216960"")",,,Cancer Research,68,3620-3620

Metabolomics is a novel tool to explore the biological mechanisms of the health effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution. Very few studies have examined the urinary metabolomic changes associated with PM2.5 exposure.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the alternation in urine metabolomics in response to short-term PM2.5 exposure.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of 9-day real or sham indoor air purification among 45 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Urine samples were collected immediately at the end of each intervention stage and were analyzed for metabolomics using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and linear mixed effect models were used to examine metabolomic changes between interventional scenarios and their associations with continuous PM2.5 exposure.


RESULTS
The time-weighted average personal PM2.5 exposure in the real-purified scenario was 50% lower than in the sham-purified air scenario (28.3â€¯Î¼g/m3 VS 56.9â€¯Î¼g/m3). A total of 40 differentiated urinary metabolites at a false discovery rate <0.05 were identified for the effects of both intervention and continuous PM2.5 exposure, including 16 lipids, 5 purine metabolites, 2 neurotransmitters, and 3 coenzymes.


CONCLUSIONS
This real-world randomized crossover trial demonstrated that short-term PM2.5 exposure could result in significant changes in urinary metabolomic profile, which may further lead to perturbation in energy metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation.",2019,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Chen Chen"", ids = ""48239897""); list(name = ""Huichu Li"", ids = ""13032147""); list(name = ""Yue Ting Niu"", ids = ""31633529""); list(name = ""Cong Liu"", ids = ""49046791""); list(name = ""Zhijing Lin"", ids = ""7767024""); list(name = ""Jing Cai"", ids = ""50490194""); list(name = ""Weihua Li"", ids = ""47113457""); list(name = ""Wenzhen Ge"", ids = ""5593062""); list(name = ""Renjie Chen"", ids = ""145890722""); list(name = ""Haidong Kan"", ids = ""2136813"")",,,Environment international,130,"

4a27761b47c79dc1cece1bf24f0de2ce93cb3262,False discovery rates: a new deal,"&NA; We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for largeâ€scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This â€œunimodal assumptionâ€ (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computationâ€”estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problemâ€”and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term â€œlocal false sign rateâ€ to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated.

 to explore the biomarkers and therapeutic targets for gliomas","AbstractTo improve treatment strategies of glioma, microarray data were applied to screen
                target molecules that were regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). GSE31262 was downloaded
                from Gene Expression Omnibus, including five neural stem cells samples from normal
                human and nine stem cells samples from glioma patients. Differentially expressed
                genes (DEGs) were identified with Multtest package and Limma package of R language,
                and false discovery rate <Â 0.05 and |log2FC (fold change)|
                >1 were chosen as cut-off criterion. Hierarchical clustering and pathway
                enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using pheatmap package of R language and
                KOBAS software, respectively. miRNAs related to up- and down-regulated DEGs were,
                respectively, predicted by WebGestalt software and its miRNAs-target DEGs
                interaction network were, respectively, constructed by STRING database. Bingo
                plug-in in Cytoscape software was applied to analyze Gene Ontology functional
                enrichment analysis for up- and down-regulated DEGs in network, respectively. A
                total of 428 DEGs were selected, including 331 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated
                DEGs. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that glioma samples and normal samples
                were completely separated. Pathway analysis indicated that CDK2 and WEE1 participated in the
                cell cycle. miR-124 could simultaneously regulate up-regulated (ELAVL1 and EZH2)
                and down-regulated (BACE1) DEGs. The
                down-regulated genes (KIF23, WEE1 and CDK2) were
                associated with cell division, while the up-regulated genes (PLP1 and MBP) were related to
                myelination of neurons. miR-124 might participate in development of glioma by
                regulating BACE1, ELAVL1 and EZH2. The biomarkers (KIF23, WEE1, CDK2, PLP1 and
                    MBP) were considered as therapeutic targets

5d34c13bed26960fa973f39836c3588d3f18546f,Inter-Fraction Tumor Volume Response during Lung Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Correlated to Patient Variables,"PURPOSE
Analyze inter-fraction volumetric changes of lung tumors treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and determine if the volume changes during treatment can be predicted and thus considered in treatment planning.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
Kilo-voltage cone-beam CT (kV-CBCT) images obtained immediately prior to each fraction were used to monitor inter-fraction volumetric changes of 15 consecutive patients (18 lung nodules) treated with lung SBRT at our institution (45-54 Gy in 3-5 fractions) in the year of 2011-2012. Spearman's (Ï) correlation and Spearman's partial correlation analysis was performed with respect to patient/tumor and treatment characteristics. Multiple hypothesis correction was performed using False Discovery Rate (FDR) and q-values were reported.


RESULTS
All tumors studied experienced volume change during treatment. Tumor increased in volume by an average of 15% and regressed by an average of 11%. The overall volume increase during treatment is contained within the planning target volume (PTV) for all tumors. Larger tumors increased in volume more than smaller tumors during treatment (q = 0.0029). The volume increase on CBCT was correlated to the treatment planning gross target volume (GTV) as well as internal target volumes (ITV) (q = 0.0085 and q = 0.0039 respectively) and could be predicted for tumors with a GTV less than 22 mL. The volume increase was correlated to the integral dose (ID) in the ITV at every fraction (q = 0.0049). The peak inter-fraction volume occurred at an earlier fraction in younger patients (q = 0.0122).


CONCLUSIONS
We introduced a new analysis method to follow inter-fraction tumor volume changes and determined that the observed changes during lung SBRT treatment are correlated to the initial tumor volume, integral dose (ID), and patient age. Furthermore, the volume increase during treatment of tumors less than 22mL can be predicted during treatment planning. The volume increase remained significantly less than the overall PTV expansion, and radiation re-planning was therefore not required for the purpose of tumor control. The presence of the studied correlations suggests that the observed volumetric changes may reflect some underlying biologic process rather than random fluctuations.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""S.

23c76873fda3014ac76cc462ef04244190f084ad,Beyond Bonferroni: Less conservative analyses for conservation genetics,"Studies in conservation genetics often attempt to determine genetic differentiation between two or more temporally or geographically distinct sample collections. Pairwise p-values from Fisherâ€™s exact tests or contingency Chi-square tests are commonly reported with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. While the Bonferroni correction controls the experiment-wise Î±, this correction is very conservative and results in greatly diminished power to detect differentiation among pairs of sample collections. An alternative is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) that provides increased power, but this method only maintains experiment-wise Î± when none of the pairwise comparisons are significant. Recent modifications to the FDR method provide a moderate approach to determining significance level. Simulations reveal that critical values of multiple comparison tests with both the Bonferroni method and a modified FDR method approach a minimum asymptote very near zero as the number of tests gets large, but the Bonferroni method approaches zero much more rapidly than the modified FDR method. I compared pairwise significance from three published studies using three critical values corresponding to Bonferroni, FDR, and modified FDR methods. Results suggest that the modified FDR method may provide the most biologically important critical value for evaluating significance of population differentiation in conservation genetics.â£Ultimately, more thorough reporting of statistical significance is needed to allow interpretation of biological significance of genetic differentiation among populations.",2005,,"list(name = ""Shawn R Narum"", ids = ""5679740"")",f270e9896fcaa53116395c27ae66d2580703d50d;

0aa572177a5d41829fa1c7e0a4ef7e8e0f037804,Metabolomic profiling identifies pathways associated with minimal residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"BACKGROUND
End-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) is the strongest predictor of relapse in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but an understanding of the biological pathways underlying early treatment response remains elusive. We hypothesized that metabolomic profiling of diagnostic bone marrow plasma could provide insights into the underlying biology of early treatment response and inform treatment strategies for high-risk patients.


METHODS
We performed global metabolomic profiling of samples from discovery (Nâ€¯=â€¯93) and replication (Nâ€¯=â€¯62) cohorts treated at Texas Children's Hospital. Next, we tested the cytotoxicity of drugs targeting central carbon metabolism in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells.


FINDINGS
Metabolite set enrichment analysis identified altered central carbon and amino acid metabolism in MRD-positive patients from both cohorts at a 5% false discovery rate. Metabolites from these pathways were used as inputs for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Two distinct clusters were identified, which were independently associated with MRD after adjustment for immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and NCI risk group. Three nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors, which reduce glycolytic/TCA cycle activities, demonstrated nanomolar-range cytotoxicity in B- and T-ALL cell lines and PDX cells.


INTERPRETATION
This study provides new insights into the role of central carbon metabolism in early treatment response and as a potential targetable pathway in high-risk disease.

6f4efce9269a9c6e5f6e78875218c70eb2692397,Soil development and establishment of carbon-based properties in created freshwater marshes.,"The current U.S. wetland mitigation policy of ""no net loss"" requires that a new wetland be created to replace any natural wetland destroyed under development pressures. This policy, however, may be resulting in a net loss of carbon-based wetland functions. We evaluated the ability of created wetlands to accumulate carbon and to mitigate loss of carbon-based functions in natural wetlands with variable hydrology. Potential limiting factors to carbon accumulation within created systems included soil aggregation, texture, and bulk density. Rates of soil development and the time required for created wetlands to accumulate the amount of carbon found in natural wetlands were estimated by an exponential model. Soils collected from five created (ages 3-8 years) and four natural freshwater marshes, located in central Ohio, USA, were analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC), mineralizable soil carbon (Cmin), water-stable aggregates (WSA), particle-size fractions (PSD), and bulk density. Peak-standing aboveground plant biomass was also quantified. Created wetlands contained significantly less plant biomass, SOC, and Cmin than natural wetlands (c < 0.05; false discovery rate). Soil physical properties also differed significantly between created and natural wetlands, with fewer macroaggregates, more microaggregates, more silt-clay (0-5 cm only), and higher bulk density in created wetlands (a < 0.05; false discovery rate). Carbon content was positively correlated with macroaggregate content and negatively correlated with microaggregate content, silt-clay fraction, and bulk density. Fit of SOC data to the exponential model indicated that a newly created wetland would require 300 years to sequester the amount of SOC contained in a natural wetland. At this rate of carbon accumulation, a mitigation ratio of 2.7:1 (area) would be necessary for successful mitigation over a 50-year time period. However, other trajectories fit the data equally well and suggested area mitigation ratios of 2.2:1 (logistic) to 4.4:1 (linear regression) to 5.1:1 (exponential regression). Whether created wetlands are on a trajectory toward natural wetland carbon function, however, remains uncertain. Until gaps in the data are filled and a trajectory verified, the best mitigation policy will be a conservative one, with a restrictive permitting process and high mitigation ratios (5.1:1 minimum).",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Katie Hossler"", ids = ""4679730""); list(name = ""Virginie Bouchard"", ids = ""1904951"")",feb9090d2dd20c0fc13a382ab49b0df84df64e14; 8118a8b534ff20aa15c50a6769fe1363f319d1be; 45a2a2c80da13389284f65ffb497e195bf18ce63; 2fb3b125954b0ddb56686ed3f81598ba02db9a88; ae8077168b017879237188e58c781fb9c912fd89; 3ac63be4f52b4a8bcd5cc46bc0019515d8c94bd7; 5f77c155fc70f8d0a7c7a7a02103e7c0ed56aad0; 839e9134a0a2c3f78afdd347d83c3c216dbef26d; 860b4fcfea5ab3feb1963895af3f503564747ce4; 067f5b0410cb6088b49751a16076ade38f9d6071; 59509beddaf1c5c13bf98713c4f2317471b6a8d3; e52c58c0f060b7d492a79df652b0a777b112472b; 09bf7ab45ad2e8e135f251e7a3170f0fabc42a1f; 6170a4a06ee1692a18d7028e66fb6b18f34a3cdc; 7f9879966a3406493f0f6ca1aa2ee1a16f9fc7a1; c67a0fce12b7e5743708213915c492f1cfa6e213; 04953718fb5c286853c87a9eaee5200220737992; 502fd690a0b1feeec10204a5643bcc7b0d5da6e4; 9b45215859d733f16fe91be2c62809c5ec9811f7; 989ea3f00648794f13ad492629a9169f9d130c1e; 71634b8414fb164aa350e6b0152c4289aff627a6; d5543db6765efc094b5276fb72cbb06f24005f03; 04426007e6607aaaa6fd556932d450af820a1acd; 27c2c2f620ac7051b6ad70e729e21f745f8fe5a5; a1f9197e6387b9467823395df8de7360cd01d10b; 21292f7cd8838af6c97fd03fb1b2a365b7d2263f; 9fc9ab381330eb7d7f76ef6d6e052b4bd6e3ce77; 006566b7cd96fe88692d04b4d9125ff54b0a3d14; c6f7a9aad7378008c5ba4c78e87aa0bea76305e9; 58bdd89690071448d5943be0109bd3a2f6ebc815; 4f41d3a172d6a01ed15ab7ef41dd22089ab46cf2; 91f9397b6ba441b8bb70cd6c0bbcdbd6f1103632; f21ffc8afdf6c0249b69a04a846cc257f5cf668e; fc00802529cceca38d153f9f7f95cae3ab959383; 14b9a52cc515d7dd159d1258ebdb2984618db89a; ecb3724d9b1bae1370863399efaff34d90352031; 409d3b2395bd9dab228edaddd3714add546f9d72; 4d43dc6a7d063a10f9bbcda9821e850a012f7c22; f0771bda192ace32e24023d245270244b0a4ea15; 790559f9152a99fc0413bb6aa56d4d69a9f6ffe6; 0e434167684ba1f0d1db4b443b72773e27499b50; 1b55a82d48cb463ac0c2937acfa361d337903410,,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,20 2,"

7faa6faf6efa49823d5c61fd390ae75d2804983d,Expression Quantitative Trait Loci in Equine Skeletal Muscle Reveals Heritable Variation in Metabolism and the Training Responsive Transcriptome,"While over ten thousand genetic loci have been associated with phenotypic traits and inherited diseases in genome-wide association studies, in most cases only a relatively small proportion of the trait heritability is explained and biological mechanisms underpinning these traits have not been clearly identified. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are subsets of genomic loci shown experimentally to influence gene expression. Since gene expression is one of the primary determinants of phenotype, the identification of eQTL may reveal biologically relevant loci and provide functional links between genomic variants, gene expression and ultimately phenotype. Skeletal muscle (gluteus medius) gene expression was quantified by RNA-seq for 111 Thoroughbreds (47 male, 64 female) in race training at a single training establishment sampled at two time-points: at rest (n = 92) and four hours after high-intensity exercise (n = 77); n = 60 were sampled at both time points. Genotypes were generated from the Illumina Equine SNP70 BeadChip. Applying a False Discovery Rate (FDR) corrected P-value threshold (P FDR < 0.05), association tests identified 3,583 cis-eQTL associated with expression of 1,456 genes at rest; 4,992 cis-eQTL associated with the expression of 1,922 genes post-exercise; 1,703 trans-eQTL associated with 563 genes at rest; and 1,219 trans-eQTL associated with 425 genes post-exercise. The gene with the highest cis-eQTL association at both time-points was the endosome-associated-trafficking regulator 1 gene (ENTR1; Rest: P FDR = 3.81 Ã— 10-27, Post-exercise: P FDR = 1.66 Ã— 10-24), which has a potential role in the transcriptional regulation of the solute carrier family 2 member 1 glucose transporter protein (SLC2A1). Functional analysis of genes with significant eQTL revealed significant enrichment for cofactor metabolic processes. These results suggest heritable variation in genomic elements such as regulatory sequences (e.g. gene promoters, enhancers, silencers), microRNA and transcription factor genes, which are associated with metabolic function and may have roles in determining end-point muscle and athletic performance phenotypes in Thoroughbred horses. The incorporation of the eQTL identified with genome and transcriptome-wide association may reveal useful biological links between genetic variants and their impact on traits of interest, such as elite racing performance and adaptation to training.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Gabriella Farries"", ids = ""12760114""); list(name = ""Kenneth Bryan"", ids = ""152564775""); list(name = ""Charlotte L.

093718f7c47e5ab31ce1b3108f4aec8d5af38231,Identification of alternative splice variants in Aspergillus flavus through comparison of multiple tandem MS search algorithms,"BackgroundDatabase searching is the most frequently used approach for automated peptide assignment and protein inference of tandem mass spectra. The results, however, depend on the sequences in target databases and on search algorithms. Recently by using an alternative splicing database, we identified more proteins than with the annotated proteins in Aspergillus flavus. In this study, we aimed at finding a greater number of eligible splice variants based on newly available transcript sequences and the latest genome annotation. The improved database was then used to compare four search algorithms: Mascot, OMSSA, X! Tandem, and InsPecT.ResultsThe updated alternative splicing database predicted 15833 putative protein variants, 61% more than the previous results. There was transcript evidence for 50% of the updated genes compared to the previous 35% coverage. Database searches were conducted using the same set of spectral data, search parameters, and protein database but with different algorithms. The false discovery rates of the peptide-spectrum matches were estimated < 2%. The numbers of the total identified proteins varied from 765 to 867 between algorithms. Whereas 42% (1651/3891) of peptide assignments were unanimous, the comparison showed that 51% (568/1114) of the RefSeq proteins and 15% (11/72) of the putative splice variants were inferred by all algorithms. 12 plausible isoforms were discovered by focusing on the consensus peptides which were detected by at least three different algorithms. The analysis found different conserved domains in two putative isoforms of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase.ConclusionsWe were able to detect dozens of new peptides using the improved alternative splicing database with the recently updated annotation of the A. flavus genome. Unlike the identifications of the peptides and the RefSeq proteins, large variations existed between the putative splice variants identified by different algorithms. 12 candidates of putative isoforms were reported based on the consensus peptide-spectrum matches. This suggests that applications of multiple search engines effectively reduced the possible false positive results and validated the protein identifications from tandem mass spectra using an alternative splicing database.",2011,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kung-yen Chang"", ids = ""47711516""); list(name = ""David C.

4054bfd8382da6e582fccd9a5afe9a6439312a42,Finite Mixture Models in Biostatistics,"Abstract Mixture models are powerful tools for density estimation and cluster and discriminant analyses. They have enjoyed widespread popularity in biostatistics, biomedicine, medical imaging, and genetics, among many other applied fields. The mixture model framework provides a formal but convenient and flexible approach to model complex heterogeneous datasets such as those that typically arise in biological studies. This chapter discusses two interesting applications of mixture models in biostatistics, namely, the analysis of cytometry data and of microarray data. We begin with a brief overview of mixture models and a general discussion of recent advances in this area, focusing on trends that are relevant to biostatistics and health science. In particular, we consider techniques that address challenges in analyzing large biomedical datasets, including dimension reduction, the handling of asymmetric and nonnormal clusters, and accounting for inter- and intracluster variations. These are demonstrated via the EMMIX-JCM and EMMIX-contrasts procedures, which are based on random-effects skew mixture models and linear mixed-effects mixture models, respectively. In several applications of EMMIX-JCM to flow cytometric datasets, we illustrate how mixture models can automate the segmentation of cells in samples, align clusters across samples, build batch templates, and predict the labels for new samples. Further illustrations are given using EMMIX-contrasts on real and simulated microarray datasets to showcase the effectiveness of mixture models in clustering gene expression data, ranking genes, and controlling false discovery rate.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Sharon X.

d59814a5eaa56342870e829ce7f28f5bdd18432b,Increased expression of neurotensin in high grade serous ovarian carcinoma with evidence of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma,"High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) without identifiable serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) within the fallopian tube (FT) occurs in approximately 50% of patients. The objective of this study was to use a multisite tumor sampling approach to study HGSC with and without STIC. RNAseq analysis of HGSC samples collected from multiple sites e.g. ovary, FT and peritoneum, revealed moderate levels of intrapatient heterogeneity in gene expression that could influence molecular profiles. Mixed-model ANOVA analysis of gene expression in tumor samples from patients with multiple tumor sites (nâ€‰=â€‰13) and patients with a single site tumor sample (nâ€‰=â€‰11) to compare HGSC-STIC to HGSC-NOSTIC identified neurotensin (NTS) as significantly higher (> two-fold change, False Discovery Rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.10) in HGSC-STIC. This data was validated using publicly available RNA-Seq datasets. Concordance between higher NTS gene expression and NTS peptide levels in HGSC-STIC samples was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. To determine the role of NTS in HGSC, five ovarian cancer (OvCa) cell lines were screened for expression of NTS and its receptors, NTSR1 and NTSR3. Increased expression of NTS and NSTR1 was observed in several of the OvCa cells, whereas the NTSR3 receptor was lower in all OvCa cells, compared to immortalized FT epithelial cells. Treatment with NTSR1 inhibitor (SR48692) decreased cell proliferation, but increased cell migration in OvCa cells. The effects of SR48692 were receptor mediated, since transient RNAi knockdown of NTSR1 mimicked the migratory effects and knockdown of NTSR3 mimicked the anti-proliferative effects. Further, knockdown of NTSR1 or NTSR3 was associated with acquisition of distinct morphological phenotypes, epithelial or mesenchymal, respectively. Taken together, our results reveal a difference in a biologically active pathway between HGSC with and without STIC. Furthermore, we identify neurotensin signaling as an important pathway involved in cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HGSC-STIC which warrants further study as a potential therapeutic target.

7a83f3baf7355466f8c2cbfd1daa5a53a49e25bd,Targeted Myocardial Gene Expression Profiling By RNA Sequencing,"Purpose: Myocardial recovery with LVAD therapy is highly variable and difficult to predict. Next generation RNA sequencing is an innovative, rapid, and quantitative approach to gene expression profiling. Our goal was to identify baseline patterns of gene expression in non-ischemic cardiomyopathies that predict myocardial recovery in response to LVAD therapy. Methods: 10 ng of RNA was used to make cDNA and amplify targeted genes by PCR using a custom cardiac panel (95 targeted genes). Additional library amplification was done by PCR after ligated to adapters to amplicons. Libraries were amplified by emulsion PCR on Ion Sphere particles (ISPs) on one touch 2 and sequencing was performed on PGM sequencer using Ion 316 chip. Coverage analysis as well as mapping the reads and alignment was done using the Ion Torrent Browser SuiteTM. Analysis of cardiac gene expression as correlated to change in ejection fraction for heart failure patients was done using the edgeR method. The Bejamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate (FDR) to be no more than 0.05. Cardiac function was evaluated at 3 and 12 months by echocardiography. Results: Myosin light chain kinase (MYLK) gene is involved in the regulation of sarcomeres in heart as well as actin-myosin interactions which create contractility. NPPB gene is a natriuretic peptide (NP) gene involved in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis and is suggested to be a modulator of cardiac hypertrophy. Conclusion: MYLK and NPPB expression were positively correlated with EF response to LVAD placement. Targeted RNA sequencing of myocardial gene expression could be utilized to identify responders to LVAD therapy.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Kajari Dhar"", ids = ""48456322""); list(name = ""Alexandra Moulton"", ids = ""8522508""); list(name = ""E.

The relationship between SNPs and genes, captured in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, can be represented as a network with edges connecting SNPs and genes. Existing network methods treat such edges as fixed and known when they are most often thresholded estimates from eQTL regression. We consider various characterizations of an essential feature of nodes of eQTL networks, their degree centrality, that retains different data on eQTLs. We define the network metric of degree to be estimated by false discovery rates, test statistics, and p-values of the eQTL regressions in order to represent how central and potentially influential a SNP is to the network. We calculate degree metrics for data from 21 tissues from the GTEx project to assess the reproducibility, correlation across tissues, and, functional importance of degree.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Sheila M Gaynor"", ids = ""40048740""); list(name = ""Maud Fagny"", ids = ""6776217""); list(name = ""Xihong Lin"", ids = ""144361840""); list(name = ""John Platig"", ids = ""1940671""); list(name = ""John Quackenbush"", ids = ""120934399"")",,195258ac5c44cc7c6b2ad0be6ac2a80bed783a2f; 8bdfefc4d88f48e99e108a9b3185fbec1a5b1e8e; b9d3d3805001a365c89dd16bfef4fe4c84322632; b1145d8c2eb59e49835445bcb5bcccce8db8e796; a1ef4a4c6d6493860920986b6ab483e6981c0d7e; 3c39e2f4a321d03635860653bf5b4f4b32e982dc; 76638b1bb15097926b6ecb57a7f25e44bd179a3d; 2d0851086cdc8b2300b307335dea01c2260e06e0; 5b3841e147e3196f14e2f6212bd95398d6190224; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; a02c15d4fd047ef87ddb8adba1f7c02f1a209622; 7fcabcb1dff389a3c8750c983b1b34753cbce59e; 301404fe6fd36e9d06ca29c3efe5f29ce885f26d; b5f109c8d49a95f72313aff41cf8a0b2e8e1407a; da63af190d8a672063734055a0d4455bb154d4da; 2459b8e56f02c9d9c3b19ae8fcd75fedf05391d5; 74e02be50a233bc63acb1157cd50f04caf53e05a; 76051b7733422a38747cf91f68e988550c439c5d; f30dbf931e049753aeb0132ca47ec110cc326b43; 2150453e4b50d1626f7a103922e209f19cad6843; 54566d9fdfad503f98c25a394ec50e1bb625b532,bioRxiv,,
527668e5d4120fa462c77b3dc2ba476db0e17232,The Gene Expression Signatures (GEP) of Whole Bone Marrow Biopsies (Bx) from Patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM) in Remission Reflect Disease Risk and Therapy.,"Background: We have previously shown that the GEP signatures of whole bone marrow biopsies from patients with MM can be distinguished from those of normal healthy subjects. What is not clear is whether the GEP of myeloma Bx samples returns to normal in clinical remission following tandem stem cell transplantation. Patients and Methods: Samples included random Bx from 85 newly diagnosed MM patients treated on Total Therapy 2 protocol; 22 also had Bx in remission and 19 at relapse; in addition, Bx were available from 8 subjects with MGUS and 12 normal donors. Labeled cRNA was applied to Affymetrix U133Plus2 microarrays. Significant analysis of microarray (SAM) was performed to identify remission-related genes by comparing normal cases with remission cases. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was employed on Log2 transformed GEP intensity values of remission-related gene identified with SAM using a false discovery rate of 1%. Results: Altogether 998 genes were significantly differentially expressed in a comparison of normal and remission samples. Of these, 31 (3%) were higher and 967 (97%) lower in remission samples compared to normal donors. Two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis using the 998 genes and 22 remission and 12 normal donor samples provided visual evidence of 2 separate remission signatures. A single sample acquired what appeared to be a completely normal signature with 8 of 22 cases having a normal-like signature and 12 of the 22 cases having a distinct non-normal signature. Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering with remission-related genes using whole biopsies from 85 newly diagnosed MM, 8 MGUS, 22 remissions, and 19 relapses produced 2 major branches: one contained 50 MM (59%), 5 MGUS (63%), 10 remissions (45%), and 4 relapses (21%) with the second branch containing 35 MM (41%), 3 MGUS (37%), 12 remissions (55 %), and 15 relapses (79%). All 12 of the non-normal , while none of the 10 normal-like remissions, clustered in the group containing the majority of relapse cases (p=0.002). A comparison of 16 clinical variables amongst the newly diagnosed cases revealed that the 35 clustering with the non-normal remission cases were significantly associated with higher levels of B2M (P = 0.001), creatinine (P = 0.0056) and LDH (P = 0.024); higher incidence of abnormal (P = .0075) and a lower incidence of hyperdiploid karyotypes (P = 0.0004); higher levels of FISH-1q21 amplification (P = 0.04) and FISH-13 deletion (P = 0.04, 80% cutoff); lower HGB (P = 0.0058), and fewer MRI-defined focal lesions (P = 0.03). There was a strong trend for the presence of high-risk features at diagnosis among the 12 non-normal remission samples compared to the 10 normal-like samples. Of the 10 cases with the normal-like remission signature, 8 were on the thalidomide arm of the trial but only 4 of 12 patients with the non-normal remission signature were on the thalidomide arm (P=0.029). Conclusion: Despite -obtaining a clinical remission, the gene expression pattern within the marrow of myeloma patients does not return to normal in a substantial subset of patients.",2005,Medicine,"list(name = ""Fenghuang Zhan"", ids = ""1784631""); list(name = ""Yongsheng Huang"", ids = ""7524754""); list(name = ""Rudy Van Hemert"", ids = ""7584870""); list(name = ""Owen W.

162b66044d23815e3eb9e1e8b870d17db0aea147,PePr: a peak-calling prioritization pipeline to identify consistent or differential peaks from replicated ChIP-Seq data,"MOTIVATION
ChIP-Seq is the standard method to identify genome-wide DNA-binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) and histone modifications. There is a growing need to analyze experiments with biological replicates, especially for epigenomic experiments where variation among biological samples can be substantial. However, tools that can perform group comparisons are currently lacking.


RESULTS
We present a peak-calling prioritization pipeline (PePr) for identifying consistent or differential binding sites in ChIP-Seq experiments with biological replicates. PePr models read counts across the genome among biological samples with a negative binomial distribution and uses a local variance estimation method, ranking consistent or differential binding sites more favorably than sites with greater variability. We compared PePr with commonly used and recently proposed approaches on eight TF datasets and show that PePr uniquely identifies consistent regions with enriched read counts, high motif occurrence rate and known characteristics of TF binding based on visual inspection. For histone modification data with broadly enriched regions, PePr identified differential regions that are consistent within groups and outperformed other methods in scaling False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis.

a821bf9fb8f72211217e25437018eba5ed1d0022,A Comparison of Gene Expression Pattern in Major Histocompatibility Class II-Low Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma with Plasmablastic Lymphoma.,"Abstract 1941 Poster Board I-964 Multiple studies have repeatedly shown that loss of MHC II expression correlates with poor patient prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules present peptides for antigen recognition and are important for the adaptive immune response. Loss of MHCII expression is also one of the changes seen during normal B-cell differentiation into plasma cells. Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is another B-cell lymphoma characterized by a proliferation of large B-cells with a plasma cell immunophenotype and very poor prognosis. In this study, we questioned whether DLBCL cases that have low MHCII expression have a similar gene expression pattern to PBL. Unstained cuts from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 101 DLBCL and 76 PBL cases were analyzed for gene expression using a quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA, ArrayPlate R ). The 42 genes on the array were previously identified as B-cell lineage-related or prognostically important in DLBCL. DLBCL cases were divided into low [MHCII(-)] and high [MHCII(+)] MHC II expression using a 20% cutoff for expression of HLA-DRB by qNPA, as previously described (L Rimsza et al, Blood 2008). Genes that differed significantly between lymphoma types were determined using the Partek Genomics Suite R software, using ANOVA tests with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Thirty of the 42 genes on the array (71%) were differentially expressed between DLBCL as a whole and PBL. As expected from the literature, the PBL cases had less expression of B-cell antigen, MHCII, and germinal center-related genes as compared to DLBCL. Of these 30 genes, 29 were also different between MHCII(+) and PBL. In contrast, only 21 genes of the 42 on the array (50%) were differentially expressed between MHCII(-) and PBL, indicating a less dissimilar expression pattern between these two sets of cases. Of the 21 genes, two were uniquely different between MHCII(-) and PBL. Both of these, FN1 and CTGF , are found in the extracellular matrix and were low in the MHCII(-) cases. This finding, that the MHCII(-) cases are similar, but not identical to PBL, agrees with our previous immunohistochemistry studies suggesting MHCII(-) cases may be invoking selected mechanisms of differentiation (S Wilkinson et al, AACR Annual Meeting 2009, #2712). Our findings confirm the hypothesis that MHCII(-) DLBCL have a more plasma cell-like expression pattern than MHCII(+) DLBCL. These findings may have implications for pathogenesis and treatment.

Tukey (2000) pointed out that the usual 2-sided, equal-tails null hypothesis test at level alpha can be reinterpreted as simultaneous tests of 2 directional inequality hypotheses, each at level alpha/2, and that the maximum probability of a Type I error is alpha/2 if the truth of the null hypothesis is considered impossible. This article points out that in multiple testing with familywise error rate controlled at alpha, the directional error rate (assuming all null hypotheses are false) is greater than alpha/2 and can be arbitrarily close to alpha.

cd932e6565e8d4e30ae24a62ed47d28fcfa57d3c,A novel algorithm for validating peptide identification from a shotgun proteomics search engine.,"Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has revolutionized the proteomics analysis of complexes, cells, and tissues. In a typical proteomic analysis, the tandem mass spectra from a LC-MS/MS experiment are assigned to a peptide by a search engine that compares the experimental MS/MS peptide data to theoretical peptide sequences in a protein database. The peptide spectra matches are then used to infer a list of identified proteins in the original sample. However, the search engines often fail to distinguish between correct and incorrect peptides assignments. In this study, we designed and implemented a novel algorithm called De-Noise to reduce the number of incorrect peptide matches and maximize the number of correct peptides at a fixed false discovery rate using a minimal number of scoring outputs from the SEQUEST search engine. The novel algorithm uses a three-step process: data cleaning, data refining through a SVM-based decision function, and a final data refining step based on proteolytic peptide patterns. Using proteomics data generated on different types of mass spectrometers, we optimized the De-Noise algorithm on the basis of the resolution and mass accuracy of the mass spectrometer employed in the LC-MS/MS experiment. Our results demonstrate De-Noise improves peptide identification compared to other methods used to process the peptide sequence matches assigned by SEQUEST. Because De-Noise uses a limited number of scoring attributes, it can be easily implemented with other search engines.",2013,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Ling Jian"", ids = ""47661666""); list(name = ""Xinnan Niu"", ids = ""35903239""); list(name = ""Zhonghang Xia"", ids = ""2237698""); list(name = ""Parimal Samir"", ids = ""3442756""); list(name = ""Chiranthani Sumanasekera"", ids = ""46441869""); list(name = ""Zheng Dong Mu"", ids = ""37116968""); list(name = ""Jennifer L.

Discussion on statistical models, data distributions, measures of variation, and concepts of probability leads us to a robust understanding of the assumptions behind commonly used statistical tests. Null hypothesis testing, both according to Neymanâ€“Pearson and Fisher, is explained at length, as are the virtues and sins of the p value. The concepts of the false discovery rate and the q value are introduced as an alternative to and an extension of p values. Different approaches to multiple testing are compared. A practical approach to â€œerror barsâ€ (SD, SEM, CI) ensues. The concept of likelihood is introduced to help to quantitatively work with scientific evidence. The likelihood ratios, likelihood functions, and likelihood intervals lead us naturally to the Bayes factors and to analysis of relative odds of meaningful scientific hypotheses being true.",2015,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Ãœlo MaivÃ¤li"", ids = ""6467820"")",e9384ca43739dd6071226b233fee4e7663c60a01,,,,159-221
221667c556acd3b1c2ffe462badbc42b50300337,"PET imaging of putative microglial activation in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis, recently diagnosed and chronically ill with schizophrenia","We examined putative microglial activation as a function of illness course in schizophrenia. Microglial activity was quantified using [11C](R)-(1-[2-chrorophynyl]-N-methyl-N-[1-methylpropyl]-3 isoquinoline carboxamide (11C-(R)-PK11195) positron emission tomography (PET) in: (i) 10 individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of psychosis; (ii) 18 patients recently diagnosed with schizophrenia; (iii) 15 patients chronically ill with schizophrenia; and, (iv) 27 age-matched healthy controls. Regional-binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the simplified reference-tissue model with four alternative reference inputs. The UHR, recent-onset and chronic patient groups were compared to age-matched healthy control groups to examine between-group BPND differences in 6 regions: dorsal frontal, orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, medial temporal, thalamus and insula. Correlation analysis tested for BPND associations with gray matter volume, peripheral cytokines and clinical variables. The null hypothesis of equality in BPND between patients (UHR, recent-onset and chronic) and respective healthy control groups (younger and older) was not rejected for any group comparison or region. Across all subjects, BPND was positively correlated to age in the thalamus (r=0.43, P=0.008, false discovery rate). No correlations with regional gray matter, peripheral cytokine levels or clinical symptoms were detected. We therefore found no evidence of microglial activation in groups of individuals at high risk, recently diagnosed or chronically ill with schizophrenia. While the possibility of 11C-(R)-PK11195-binding differences in certain patient subgroups remains, the patient cohorts in our study, who also displayed normal peripheral cytokine profiles, do not substantiate the assumption of microglial activation in schizophrenia as a regular and defining feature, as measured by 11C-(R)-PK11195 BPND.",2017,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Maria Angelique Di Biase"", ids = ""6415789""); list(name = ""Andrew Zalesky"", ids = ""3200076""); list(name = ""Graeme J.

P(interaction) values were determined from cross-product terms between dichotomous (ever/never) solvent variables and genotypes at examined loci in unconditional logistic regression models. The false discovery rate method was used to account for multiple comparisons. Overall associations between the chlorinated solvents dichloromethane (odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 2.69), carbon tetrachloride (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.23, 4.40), and methyl chloride (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.94, 2.20) and total non-Hodgkin lymphoma were increased among women TT for rs2070673 in the cytochrome P4502E1 gene, CYP2E1 (dichloromethane: OR = 4.42, 95% CI: 2.03, 9.62; P(interaction) < 0.01; carbon tetrachloride: OR = 5.08, 95% CI: 1.82, 14.15; P(interaction) = 0.04; and methyl chloride: OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.24, 4.51; P(interaction) = 0.03). In contrast, no effects of these solvents were observed among TA/AA women. Similar patterns were observed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, as well as marginal zone lymphoma for dichloromethane. The weak, nonsignificant overall association between benzene and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.98) was increased among women AA for rs2234922 in the microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene, EPHX1 (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.97; P(interaction) = 0.06).

394e98486f2bd945cfa0bad81f4a55db9f46c8f9,Construction and investigation of lncRNA-associated ceRNA regulatory network in papillary thyroid cancer,"Increasing evidence has experimentally proved the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) can affect the expression of RNA targets by competitively combining microRNA (miRNA) via miRNA response elements. However, an extensive ceRNA network of thyroid carcinoma in a large cohort has not been evaluated. We analyzed the RNAseq and miRNAseq data of 348Â cases of primary papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients with clinical information downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to search for potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. A computational approach was applied to build an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of PTC. In total, 780Â lncRNAs were detected as collectively dysregulated lncRNAs in all 3Â PTC variants compared with normal tissues (fold changeÂ >2 and false discovery rate <0.05). The interactions among 45Â lncRNAs, 13Â miRNAs and 86Â mRNAs constituted a ceRNA network of PTC. Nine out of the 45Â aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were related to the clinical features of PTC patients.

fd28436fbcf562872a9a409b337abe20e58f5052,A low molecular weight proteome comparison of fertile and male sterile 8 anthers of Zea mays.,"During maize anther development, somatic locular cells differentiate to support meiosis in the pollen mother cells. Meiosis is an important event during anther growth and is essential for plant fertility as pollen contains the haploid sperm. A subset of maize male sterile mutants exhibit meiotic failure, including ms8 (male sterile 8) in which meiocytes arrest as dyads and the locular somatic cells exhibit multiple defects. Systematic proteomic profiles were analysed in biological triplicates plus technical triplicates comparing ms8 anthers with fertile sibling samples at both the premeiotic and meiotic stages; proteins from 3.5 to 20 kDa were fractionated by 1-D PAGE, cleaved with Lys-C and then sequenced using a LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS paradigm. Three hundred and 59 proteins were identified with two or more assigned peptides in which each of those peptides were counted at least two or more times (0.4% peptide false discovery rate (FDR) and 0.2% protein FDR); 2761 proteins were identified with one or more assigned peptides (0.4% peptide FDR and 7.6% protein FDR). Stage-specific protein expression provides candidate stage markers for early anther development, and proteins specifically expressed in fertile compared to sterile anthers provide important clues about the regulation of meiosis. 49% of the proteins detected by this study are new to an independent whole anther proteome, and many small proteins missed by automated maize genome annotation were validated; these outcomes indicate the value of focusing on low molecular weight proteins.

Significance was set at a False Discovery Rate of 5% after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test with multiple testing threshold q<.05 was then used to compare expression in exposed and unexposed patients with advanced fibrosis in order to assess antagonism or potentiation by alcohol exposure. Permutation analysis was also performed to confirm the findings. Results: In the 39 non-drinking (unexposed) patients, 585 genes were found to be differentially expressed in patients with advanced fibrosis vs. early fibrosis, identifying a group of fibrosis-associated genes. In the 13 alcohol-exposed patients with advanced fibrosis, expression of only one of these genes (COL16A1) was potentiated, whereas the fibrosis-associated pattern of 338 other genes (including genes associated with extracellular matrix (COL1A2, FBN1); PDGF signaling (STAT1); oxidoreductases (ALDH1A3, KDM5A); integrin cell surface interactions (LAMA2); and vascular development (CXCL12,VEGFC, TGFB2) was antagonized. Histology demonstrated that the alcoholexposed patients were more likely to have early fibrosis than unexposed patients (62.5% vs. 51.2%; p=.002). They were also younger (47Â±2 vs. 53Â±2 years; p=0.015) and more likely to be male (51.5% vs. 20.5%; p=.002). Race, BMI, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and triglyceride levels did not differ significantly by exposure.

34bc9e7957c687bf9400b5497eb06445d0bbc6ac,Prediction-based reduction of the search space in metaproteomics,"Metaproteomics search databases typically take on enormous sizes since the a priori unknown composition of metaproteomics samples requires the inclusion of proteomes of hundreds to thousands of species that could potentially be found in the samples. A major consequence is that the identification rate in metaproteomics experiments remains drastically below the identification rate in single-species proteomics. Therefore, reducing the database size will not only decrease computation time, but can simultaneously increase identification rate. 
To reduce database size, I used predictions from the machine learning algorithm CP-DT. This algorithm, originally intended to predict likely tryptic cleavage sites based on an ensemble of decision trees, has been shown to also be a useful predictor of the likelihood of observing a given peptide in a proteomics experiment. Indeed, if a large database (1.85 million protein sequences) is in silico digested using CP-DT, most peptides are marked as highly unlikely to be observed by the mass spectrometer. Moreover, if the peptide search space is reduced to only the top-35% scoring peptides according to CP-DT, more than 95% of the peptides that were actually observed by the mass spectrometer, are recovered. 
From these results I can conclude that the search space can be drastically reduced using CP-DT. Ongoing work will show if this reduction in search space will lead to an increased identification rate, while keeping the false discovery rate (FDR) under control.",2018,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Tim Van Den Bossche"", ids = ""119761183""); list(name = ""Lennart Martens"", ids = ""145632158"")",,,,,
3a65b562719ce81717dab171299197f9bdbd656d,The phenotypical implications of immune dysregulation in fragile X syndrome.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Immune system dysfunction and inflammatory dysregulation have been shown in several animal models of fragile X syndrome (FXS). However, the phenotypical implications of this dysregulation have not been systematically evaluated in a large patient cohort.


METHODS
Five thousand seven hundred thirty-six FXS patients from a nationwide health insurance database were identified and compared to 573Â 600 age- and sex-matched controls. The phenome-wide association studies codes of FXS patients and those without FXS were compared and the false discovery rate was controlled at 0.05 using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.


RESULTS
In addition to the commonly reported comorbidities of FXS, an over-representation of infectious diseases, including otitis media, cellulitis and abscess of fingers or toes, viral enteritis, candidiasis and pneumonia, was discovered. In addition, there was an under-representation of autoimmune disorders in FXS patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our systematic comorbidity analyses identified immunologically-based phenotypes associated with FXS. Our findings align with previous observations of compromised immunity and phagocytic defects in animal models of FXS. These results suggest the importance of immune-related pathways in FXS patients and their relevance to the FMR1 gene.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""K-H Yu"", ids = ""27388071""); list(name = ""Nathan P.

3a5e7881e1eb65dec5bc298d929f5e7dd0dd48cd,"Abstract 3236: Lung epithelium DNA methylation: Electronic cigarette users, smokers, and never-smokers","Background: The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) among smokers and never-smokers is increasing, and is considered to be less harmful than cigarettes. However, this has not been studied in target organs for smoking-related diseases, especially the lung. Altered DNA methylation is seen in smokers and contributes to lung carcinogenesis. However, it is not known how e-cigs affect methylation in the lung or whether smoking-induced DNA methylation changes can be reversed in former smokers who switch to e-cigs. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional bronchoscopy study of e-cig users (n=12), cigarette smokers (n=10), and never-smokers (n=10) (age 21-30, 84% European-American, 66% male). Bisulfite-converted DNA extracted from lung epithelium collected by bronchial brushing was analyzed for 865,859 CpGs with the llumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Chip in a single batch. Probes were filtered out if on sex chromosomes, cross-reactive, or SNP associated, leaving 735,317 CpGs for analysis. One-way analysis of covariance using M-values was used to identify CpGs differentially methylated for the three groups. False Discovery Rate (FDR) of q Results: Smokers averaged 18 cigarettes/day (SD: 4.2) and 6 years of smoking (SD: 4.5). E-cig users vaped an average e-liquid nicotine content of 10 mg/mL (SD: 11) and 8 mL/day (SD: 4), for an average of three years (SD: 1). Mean time since smoking among the e-cig users was 31 months (SD: 15); 3 were never-smokers. We identified 517 differentially methylated CpGs among the three groups (FDR q Discussion: DNA methylation differed for never-smokers and smokers, with e-cig users9 methylation intermediate, consistent with the hypothesis that e-cigs are less harmful than smoking; whether e-cig use is more harmful than never-smoking needs to be studied. Because this study is cross-sectional, association, and not causation, is indicated. Additional observational studies and randomized trials are warranted to understand biologic changes in the lung for smokers and never-smokers using e-cigs. Citation Format: Min-Ae Song, Dominic J.

958ecff7ceca1b03c583161fd0e02e664441e62a,55 Identification of microRNAs associated with sex determination in bovine amniotic fluid and maternal blood plasma,"In most eutherian mammals, sex determination is the process through which a bipotential gonad (also known as genital ridges) develops into a testis or ovary depending on the sex chromosome content of the embryo, specifically by the presence of the SRY/Sry gene (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are involved in diverse functional roles including development, differentiation, apoptosis, and immunity. We hypothesised that the expression of miRNAs in amniotic fluid (AF) and maternal blood plasma (MP) would be affected by the sex of the embryo around the time of sex determination. Amniotic fluid and MP were collected from 6 crossbred beef pregnant heifers (3 carrying a single male and 3 carrying a single female embryo) following slaughter on Day 39 (when the peak of SRY expression occurs in cattle). All heifers had been synchronized and inseminated with semen from the same beef bull. A total of 12 samples (6 AF and 6 MP) were profiled using the miRCURY LNA miRNA Serum/Plasma Focus PCR Panel (Qiagen; 179 assays targeting relevant miRNAs). Data were analysed by GeneGlobe Data Analysis Center (Qiagen). A threshold cycle cut-off of 35 was applied and data were analysed using an unpaired t-test. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using the WebGestaltR package to explore the possible functions of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs. In this study, DE miRNAs were identified in male vs. female AF (nâ€‰=â€‰5; 3 upregulated and 2 downregulated; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and MP (nâ€‰=â€‰57; 54 upregulated and 3 downregulated; Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Although no enrichment was detected for DE miRNAs in AF (in either sex) or in MP in heifers carrying a female embryo, 37 biological processes were enriched by DE miRNAs in MP of heifers carrying a male embryo (false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Interestingly, the top five most enriched biological processes were male gonad development, development of primary male sexual characteristics, signal transduction in absence of ligand, actomyosin structure organisation, and male sex differentiation, suggesting a potential role of these miRNAs in reproductive traits. Results from this study highlight unique aspects of sex determination in cattle such as the role of miRNAs in gonad development. Moreover, although it is well known that AF provides a protective space around the developing embryo/fetus that allows its movement and growth; here we provide evidence suggesting that its components may play important roles in fetal development. Finally, miRNAs in MP may offer new opportunities to investigate biomarkers for early prediction of embryo/fetal sex in commercial practice.

Background: The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling is important in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Expression of Wnt pathway components was common in resected NSCLC and was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, Wnt pathway expression in NSCLC cell lines correlated with increased cell growth and resistance to therapy. The host genotype may modulate the effect of individual biological factors on treatment and clinical outcome. Hence, we assessed Wnt pathway pharmacogenetics in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving platinum-based therapy.

Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 598 inoperable stage III-IV NSCLC patients receiving platinum regimens. Genomic DNA was extracted from PBMCs and stored at -80o C. Illumina's Infinium iSelect HD Custom Genotyping BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) standard 3 day protocol was used to assess 441 host SNPs in 50 candidate Wnt pathway genes. BeadStudio software was used to autocall genotypes. SNPs with a call rate <95% were excluded from further analysis. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs), with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, clinical stage, performance status and therapy modality. The most common genotype served as the reference group. To correct for the effect of multiple comparisons, q values (a false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted P-value) were calculated by a method implemented in the R package. SNPs with q<0.10 were then used in the assessments of the combined effects of unfavorable genotypes. Survival tree analysis was performed to assess higher-order gene-gene interactions,

Results: Survival correlated with 57 SNPs from 21 genes. After correcting for multiple comparisons, five SNPs remained significant in multivariate analysis, including the AXIN2 SNPs rs11868547 (Hazard Ratio [HR] for variant vs. reference SNP =0.77 [95% CI, 0.66-0.89], p=0.0006) and rs4541111 (HR=0.77 [0.68-0.91], p<0.002), as well as rs12819505 (Wnt-5B, HR=1.58 [1.19-2.09], p<0.002), rs4413407 (CXXC4, HR=1.28 [1.10-1.50], p<0.002), and rs10878232 (WIF-1, HR=1.36 [1.12-1.66], p<0.003). Cumulative analysis of these SNPs showed the joint effects of unfavorable genotypes on patient survival. Survival tree analysis based on four of these SNPs revealed higher order gene-gene interactions and classified patients into two groups of low and high death risk, with median survival time of 17.3 and 11.3 months respectively (log rank p< 5 Ã— 10âˆ’8).

Conclusions: Wnt pathway SNPs were significantly associated with survival of NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. This supports published data suggesting that the Wnt pathway plays an important role in affecting clinical outcome for NSCLC.

606f05f8c1b2fe1f15bbd4cc8c389350b725840e,Optimized Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry for in Situ Interaction Proteomics.,"Recent development of mass spectrometer cleavable protein cross-linkers and algorithms for their spectral identification now permits large-scale cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS). Here, we optimized the use of cleavable disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO) cross-linker for labeling native protein complexes in live human cells. We applied a generalized linear mixture model to calibrate cross-link peptide-spectra matching (CSM) scores to control the sensitivity and specificity of large-scale XL-MS. Using specific CSM score thresholds to control the false discovery rate, we found that higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) can both be effective for large-scale XL-MS protein interaction mapping. We found that the coverage of protein-protein interaction maps is significantly improved through the use of multiple proteases. In addition, the use of focused sample-specific search databases can be used to improve the specificity of cross-linked peptide spectral matching. Application of this approach to human chromatin labeled in live cells recapitulated known and revealed new protein interactions of nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated complexes in situ. This optimized approach for mapping native protein interactions should be useful for a wide range of biological problems.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Zheng Ser"", ids = ""6142291""); list(name = ""Paolo Cifani"", ids = ""7374749""); list(name = ""Alex Kentsis"", ids = ""4539596"")",,,Journal of proteome research,18 6,"

8155a2bc8e30444ec97a6f5e1c43269b15d798ba,Gene expression profiles of bovine caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium at implantation.,"At implantation the endometrium undergoes modifications necessary for its physical interactions with the trophoblast as well as the development of the conceptus. We aim to identify endometrial factors and pathways essential for a successful implantation in the caruncular (C) and the intercaruncular (IC) areas in cattle. Using a 13,257-element bovine oligonucleotide array, we established expression profiles at day 20 of the estrous cycle or pregnancy (implantation), revealing 446 and 1,295 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in C and IC areas, respectively (false discovery rate = 0.08). The impact of the conceptus was higher on the immune response function in C but more prominent on the regulation of metabolism function in IC. The C vs. IC direct comparison revealed 1,177 and 453 DEG in cyclic and pregnant animals respectively (false discovery rate = 0.05), with a major impact of the conceptus on metabolism and cell adhesion. We selected 15 genes including C11ORF34, CXCL12, CXCR4, PLAC8, SCARA5, and NPY and confirmed their differential expression by quantitative RT-PCR. The cellular localization was analyzed by in situ hybridization and, upon pregnancy, showed gene-specific patterns of cell distribution, including a high level of expression in the luminal epithelium for C11ORF34 and MX1. Using primary cultures of bovine endometrial cells, we identified PTN, PLAC8, and CXCL12 as interferon-tau (IFNT) target genes and MSX1 and CXCR7 as IFNT-regulated genes, whereas C11ORF34 was not an IFNT-regulated gene. Our transcriptomic data provide novel molecular insights accounting for the biological functions related to the C or IC endometrial areas and may contribute to the identification of potential biomarkers for normal and perturbed early pregnancy.",2009,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nadera Mansouri-Attia"", ids = ""1422593881""); list(name = ""Julie Aubert"", ids = ""34685809""); list(name = ""Pierrette Reinaud"", ids = ""6103484""); list(name = ""Corinne Giraud-Delville"", ids = ""1398070460""); list(name = ""GÃ©raldine Taghouti"", ids = ""10334827""); list(name = ""Laurent Galio"", ids = ""10255942""); list(name = ""Robin E.

0d9332c95a81666116f8069f7adf92bab34316df,Immune-related genetic enrichment in frontotemporal dementia: An analysis of genome-wide association studies,"BACKGROUND
Converging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been performed.


METHODS AND FINDINGS
Using large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with FTD-related disorders-namely, FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-and 1 or more immune-mediated diseases including Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and psoriasis. We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA, up to 160-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and UC, up to 180-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and T1D, and up to 175-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and CeD. In contrast, for CBD and PSP, only 1 of the 6 immune-mediated diseases produced genetic enrichment comparable to that seen for FTD, with up to 150-fold genetic enrichment between CBD and CeD and up to 180-fold enrichment between PSP and RA. Further, we found minimal enrichment between ALS and the immune-mediated diseases tested, with the highest levels of enrichment between ALS and RA (up to 20-fold). For FTD, at a conjunction false discovery rate < 0.05 and after excluding SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, we found that 8 of the 15 identified loci mapped to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on Chromosome (Chr) 6. We also found novel candidate FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2), TBKBP1 (TBK1 binding protein 1), and PGBD5 (piggyBac transposable element derived 5). Functionally, we found that the expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with FTD and is enriched in microglia/macrophages compared to other central nervous system cell types. The main study limitation is that the results represent only clinically diagnosed individuals. Also, given the complex interconnectedness of the HLA region, we were not able to define the specific gene or genes on Chr 6 responsible for our pleiotropic signal.


CONCLUSIONS
We show immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune dysfunction may contribute to FTD risk. These findings have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with FTD.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Iris Broce"", ids = ""7260976""); list(name = ""Celeste M.

7f5b942d983d4a6ab14a797eeee30e13658ba748,Translocation junctions in TCF3-PBX1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cluster near transposable elements,"BackgroundHematolymphoid neoplasms frequently harbor recurrent genetic abnormalities. Some of the most well recognized lesions are chromosomal translocations, and many of these are known to play pivotal roles in pathogenesis. In lymphoid malignancies, some translocations result from erroneous V(D)J-type events. However, other translocation junctions appear randomly positioned and their underlying mechanisms are not understood.ResultsWe tested the hypothesis that genomic repeats, including both simple tandem and interspersed repeats, are involved in chromosomal translocations arising in hematopoietic malignancies. Using a database of translocation junctions and RepeatMasker annotations of the reference genome assembly, we measured the proximity of translocation sites to their nearest repeat. We examined 1,174 translocation breakpoints from 10 classifications of hematolymphoid neoplasms. We measured significance using Studentâ€™s t-test, and we determined a false discovery rate using a random permutation statistics technique.ConclusionsMost translocations showed no propensity to involve genomic repeats. However, translocation junctions at the transcription factor 3 (TCF3)/E2A immunoglobulin enhancer binding factors E12/E47 (E2A) locus clustered within, or in proximity to, transposable element sequences. Nearly half of reported TCF3 translocations involve a MER20 DNA transposon. Based on this observation, we propose this sequence is important for the oncogenesis of TCF3-PBX1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",2013,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nemanja RodiÄ‡"", ids = ""4603536""); list(name = ""John G Zampella"", ids = ""6771691""); list(name = ""Toby C Cornish"", ids = ""2211718""); list(name = ""Sarah J.

Previous research indicates that post-fertilization culture affects blastocyst quality and gene expression, and in vitro oocyte maturation and fertilization impact developmental competence. To dissect the effects of in vitro maturation, fertilization, and culture, we compared the expression profiles of single bovine blastocysts generated by: (1) in vitro maturation, fertilization and culture (IVF, n = 15); (2) in vivo maturation, in vivo fertilization, and in vitro culture (IVD, n = 14); and (3) in vivo maturation, fertilization, and development (AI, n = 14). For in vitro culture, the embryos were cultured for 2 days in CR1aa medium with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then transferred to CR1aa with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with cumulus cells until Day 7, at which time the embryos were vitrified. IVD zygotes were surgically collected from two superovulated Holstein donor cows 24 h post-insemination and cultured in the same system. To conduct expression profiling, total RNA was isolated from individual thawed embryos. The RNA was subjected to three rounds of amplification utilizing a previously adapted and validated T7 linear amplification protocol. Amplified RNA from each embryo and from a standard reference was indirectly labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 by dye swap and hybridized to a custom bovine cDNA microarray containing ~6300 unique genes. After Loess normalization, an ANOVA model (GeneSpring 6.1 and SAS 9.0) was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate approach, and a e2-fold differential criterion was applied. A subset of the differentially expressed genes was verified by real-time RT-PCR. The blastocyst rates for IVF and IVD embryos were 37% and 75%, respectively. There were 305, 365, and 200 genes differentially expressed between the AI and IVD, the IVF and IVD, and the AI and IVF comparisons, respectively. Interestingly, 44 differentially expressed genes were identified between the AI embryos and both the IVF and the IVD embryos, making these potential candidates for LOS. There were 61 genes differentially expressed between the IVF embryos and the AI and IVD embryos. The Gene Ontology categories 'RNA processing' and 'RNA binding' were over-represented among the genes that were down-regulated in the IVF embryos, indicating an effect of in vitro oocyte maturation/fertilization on embryonic gene expression.

However, IFN activity-associated molecules have been inadequately investigated. Appendicitis and appendectomy (AA), when done while young, protect against colitis development later. Our novel murine AA model protects against colitis. This therapeutic target-identifying study enumerates IFN activity-associated molecules involved in this protection. Mice with 2 laparotomies were controls (sham-sham/SS). Distal colons were harvested (4 AA-group colons and 4 SS-group colons). Microarray-analysis/reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-validation was done from RNA from each (3-days/28-days-post-AA). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to analyze distal colonic gene sets associated with 46 IFN activity-related genes. More AA-upregulated gene sets were associated with IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IRF7, IFI35, and IFI44 (False Discovery Rate-FDR <5% and P<0.001), although only IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFI44 showed individual gene upregulation (P<0.05). More AA-downregulated gene sets were associated with IRF1, IRF2, IRF4, IRF8, IRF9, IRF2BP1, IFRD1, IFRD2, and IFIH1 (FDR <5%/P<0.001); although only IRF2BP1 showed individual gene downregulation (P<0.05). There was significant upregulation (P<0.05) of IFNZ; and downregulation of IRF2BP2 and IFI30, despite no major associated GSEA differences. IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFI44, with profound AA-induced individual/GSEA upregulation, and their immunomodulatory/ antiproliferative activity, are the best molecules to investigate therapeutic potential. IRF4, IRF8, IRF2BP1, IFRD1, and IFRD2, owing to their profound AA-induced gene set downregulation, and because of their diverse lymphocytic activity, are good targets to competitively inhibit or to treat with exogenous products in knockout animals.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Rajkumar Cheluvappa"", ids = ""4449185""); list(name = ""Rajaraman D.

f5b5cf48442e2f7fe2c73573969a466b9d8f5fac,Su2106 Differences in Resting-State Bold Oscillation Signals Between Healthy and IBS Subjects,"We hypothesized that alterations of this network can accompany the cognitive abnormalities observed in cirrhotic patients. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to determine and compare the resting functional connectivity of the DMN between healthy controls and cirrhotic patients with and without MHE. Methods: 30 cirrhotics (17 with MHE and 13 without MHE) [Table 1] and 16 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Standard pre-processing was completed using Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI). Seed-based large-scale network was employed in the DMN and significant changes in connectivity were investigated. Correlation between activity in 14 apriori selected regions of interest (ROIs) of the DMN based on coordinates published in the literature were assessed. Unpaired t-test was used to differentiate the z-scored correlation coefficients between the ROI pairs and was corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR). Results: Large-scale network analysis of the DMN showed significant differences in connectivity among controls and cirrhotics with MHE. Significant differences in connectivity were seen between the right posterior cingulate and the left posterior cingulate as well as between the right anterior cingulate and the right precuneus (p=0.004) [Figure 1]. Analysis also showed significant differences between cirrhotics with and without MHE. The significant differences included the right inferior parietal and the left anterior cingulate (p=0.006) [Figure 2]. There were no significant differences seen between controls and cirrhotics without MHE.

60f332ee16f1c821f6e50864e25c7b04834584a2,Single nucleotide polymorphisms and risk of recurrence of renal-cell carcinoma: a cohort study.,"BACKGROUND
Germline genetic polymorphisms might affect the risk of recurrence in patients with localised renal-cell carcinoma. We investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms and recurrence of renal-cell carcinoma.


METHODS
We analysed germline DNA samples extracted from patients with localised renal-cell carcinoma treated at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (Boston, MA, USA). We selected a discovery cohort from a prospective database at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and selected a validation cohort from department records at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA, USA). We validated the findings from the discovery cohort in the validation cohort. We genotyped 70 genes involved in the pathogenesis of renal-cell carcinoma (including the VHL/HIF/VEGF and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, and genes involved in immune regulation and metabolism) for single nucleotide polymorphisms. We assessed the association between genotype and recurrence-free survival, adjusted for baseline characteristics, with the Cox proportional hazards model, the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test. We used a false discovery rate q value to adjust for multiple comparisons.


FINDINGS
We included 554 patients (403 in the discovery cohort and 151 in the validation cohort). We successfully genotyped 290 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, but excluded five because they did not have a variant group for comparison. The polymorphism rs11762213, which causes a synonymous aminoacid change in MET (144Gâ†’A, located in exon 2), was associated with recurrence-free survival. Patients with one or two copies of the minor (risk) allele had an increased risk of recurrence or death (hazard ratio [HR] 1Â·86, 95% CI 1Â·17-2Â·95; p=0Â·0084) in multivariate analysis. Median recurrence-free survival for carriers of the risk allele was 19 months (95% CI 9-not reached) versus 50 months (95% CI 37-75) for patients without the risk allele. In the validation cohort the HR was 2Â·45 (95% CI 1Â·01-5Â·95; p=0Â·048).


INTERPRETATION
Patients with localised renal-cell carcinoma and the MET polymorphism rs11762213 might have an increased risk of recurrence after nephrectomy. If these results are further validated in a similar population, they could be incorporated into future prognostic instruments, potentially aiding the design of adjuvant clinical trials of MET inhibitors and management of renal-cell carcinoma.

fb166916d6a4f5b95a647037079fc2bcfc1d6dc3,Multiple testing with discrete data: Proportion of true null hypotheses and two adaptive FDR procedures.,"We consider multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control when p values have discrete and heterogeneous null distributions. We propose a new estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses and demonstrate that it is less upwardly biased than Storey's estimator and two other estimators. The new estimator induces two adaptive procedures, that is, an adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and an adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg-Heyse (BHH) procedure. We prove that the adaptive BH (aBH) procedure is conservative nonasymptotically. Through simulation studies, we show that these procedures are usually more powerful than their nonadaptive counterparts and that the adaptive BHH procedure is usually more powerful than the aBH procedure and a procedure based on randomized p-value. The adaptive procedures are applied to a study of HIV vaccine efficacy, where they identify more differentially polymorphic positions than the BH procedure at the same FDR level.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xiongzhi Chen"", ids = ""40961028""); list(name = ""R.

We identified 1061 TSSs at an FDR (false discovery rate) of 10% and showed that almost all transcription in M. gallisepticum is initiated from classic TATAAT promoters, which are surrounded by A/T-rich sequences and rarely accompanied by a âˆ’35 element. Our analysis revealed the pronounced complexity of the operon structure: on average, each coding operon has one internal TSS and TT in addition to the primary ones. Our new transcriptomic approach based on the intervals between the two closest transcription initiators and/or terminators allowed us to identify two classes of TTs: strong, unregulated and hairpin-containing TTs and weak, heat shock-regulated and hairpinless TTs. Comparing the gene expression levels under different conditions (such as heat, osmotic and peroxide stresses) revealed widespread and divergent transcription regulation in M. gallisepticum. Modeling suggested that the structure of the core promoter plays a major role in gene expression regulation. We have shown that the heat stress activation of cryptic promoters combined with the suppression of hairpinless TTs leads to widespread, seemingly non-functional transcription.",2014,Biology,"list(name = ""Pavel V.

Alterations in stress-related gene expression may play a role in stress-related drinking and the risk of alcohol dependence.


METHODS
Microarrays were used to measure changes in gene expression in peripheral blood in nonsmoking, social drinking subjects exposed to 3 types of personalized imagery: neutral, stressful (but not alcohol related), and alcohol-related cues. Gene expression was measured at baseline, immediately after, and 1Â hour after stimulus presentation. Subjects were allowed to drink up to 750Â cc of beer in a ""taste test"" following stimulus presentation in each imagery condition, and the amount of beer consumed was recorded. Gene-expression levels were compared in 2 groups of nonsmoking subjects (nÂ =Â 11/group): heavy drinkers (HD; defined as regular alcohol use over the past year of at least 8 standard drinks per week for women and at least 15 standard drinks per week for men), and moderate drinkers (MD; defined as up to 7 standard drinks per week for women and 14 standard drinks per week for men). Expression of microRNA-10a (miR-10a) and microRNA-21 (miR-21) was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.


RESULTS
After correction for multiple testing (false discovery rateÂ <Â 0.05), 79 genes were identified that changed by >1.3-fold in the HD group, but not the MD group, following exposure to stress. No changes were observed for any of these genes in either group following exposure to neutral or alcohol-related imagery. Pathway analysis suggested that many of these genes, form part of the transactivation responsive (TAR)-RNA-binding protein (TRBP)-associated complex and are positively regulated by miR-10a and miR-21. Expression of both miR-10a and miR-21 was up-regulated following psychological stress in HD, but not MD subjects; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. Expression levels of both microRNAs was correlated (miR-10a, R(2) Â =Â 0.59, miR-21 R(2) Â =Â 0.57) with amount drunk in HD, but not MD subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
Expression of miR-10a, miR-21, and several of their target genes is regulated by acute psychological stress and is correlated with stress-induced drinking in a laboratory setting. Alterations in miRNA expression may be one mechanism linking psychological stress with changes in gene expression and increased alcohol intake in binge/HD.",2014,Psychology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Robert Beech"", ids = ""2201059""); list(name = ""Janine J.

668288567719a7d837cf367ef86fc015aa03f945,Dynamic adaptive procedures that control the false discovery rate.,"In the multiple testing problem with independent tests, the classical linear step-up procedure controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at level $\pi_0\alpha$, where $\pi_0$ is the proportion of true null hypotheses and $\alpha$ is the target FDR level. Adaptive procedures can improve power by incorporating estimates of $\pi_0$, which typically rely on a tuning parameter. Fixed adaptive procedures set their tuning parameters before seeing the data and can be shown to control the FDR in finite samples. We develop theoretical results for dynamic adaptive procedures whose tuning parameters are determined by the data. We show that, if the tuning parameter is chosen according to a left-to-right stopping time rule, the corresponding dynamic adaptive procedure controls the FDR in finite samples. Examples include the recently proposed right-boundary procedure and the widely used lowest-slope procedure, among others. Simulation results show that the right-boundary procedure is more powerful than other dynamic adaptive procedures under independence and mild dependence conditions.",2019,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Peter Macdonald"", ids = ""90805704""); list(name = ""Kun Liang"", ids = ""49605072"")",2914199d357273c3b4097d4f421a2672e6ba8121; a242ba57781391f9de61b9bb313b2507d98e2e64,fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; e9cddd8d7c37989539e6c6bad14db3d488441ea5; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 92f3a9e69314d9b6368a30feeb07bafc8b8dc0cf; da93ccb6024718d850498f53fa6801bc169ce800; bca451df3cdfd544611cf6186e99ca991c61712b; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 1c2ecba69104f49b0c5153fc70462c959063062f; 42b8e76177e1501b122107999819cbee8b48f093,arXiv: Methodology,,

In order to assess for prominent gene networks underlying memory impairment in MCI and AD, we compared the results from two pathway enrichment analyses of a quantitative memory phenotype. Methods: Data were obtained for 742 participants from the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Intiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). A composite, psychometrically-optimized episodic memory score was generated using item-level data from the ADNI neuropsychological test battery. We performed pathway analysis of genome-wide association data for this phenotype using 1) set-based enrichment for KEGG and REACTOME pathways in GSASNP and 2) rank-based enrichment for GeneGO pathways in MetaCore. For both analyses, genetic markers in high linkage disequilibrium (r 2 > 0.8) were removed in advance and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) was used to correct for pathway-level multiple comparisons. Results: A total of 39 pathways were enriched against memory impairment (FDR-corrected P < 0.05) using the two analytic approaches (Table). Importantly, these results were achieved despite the absence of association of any single genetic marker at genome-wide significance. While employing different pathway definitions and statistical metrics, the enrichment results reflected common realms of biology. In particular, gene networks related to long-term potentiation and depression, neurotransmission, calcium-mediated signaling, kinase activation and signaling, axon guidance and outgrowth, and cell adhesion were prominent among the enriched pathways in this study. Conclusions: These results 1) provide prime targets for future studies of memory impairment, 2) demonstrate the value of pathway analysis in detecting gene sets relevant in complex phenotypes, and 3) suggest that legitimately-associated gene networks can be identified through systematic application of multiple pathway analytic strategies. Taken together, our findings endorse a model for AD-related memory impairment that includes genetic susceptibility pathways and disease neuropathology (Figure).

Deciphering host responses contributing to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the life-threatening form of acute viral dengue infections, is required to improve both the differential prognosis and the treatments provided to DSS patients, a challenge for clinicians.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Based on a prospective study, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profiles of whole blood cells from 48 matched Cambodian children: 19 progressed to DSS while 16 and 13 presented respectively classical dengue fever (DF) or dengue hemorrhagic fever grades I/II (DHF). Using multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and adjustment of p-values to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR<10%), we identified a signature of 2959 genes differentiating DSS patients from both DF and DHF, and showed a strong association of this DSS-gene signature with the dengue disease phenotype. Using a combined approach to analyse the molecular patterns associated with the DSS-gene signature, we provide an integrative overview of the transcriptional responses altered in DSS children. In particular, we show that the transcriptome of DSS children blood cells is characterized by a decreased abundance of transcripts related to T and NK lymphocyte responses and by an increased abundance of anti-inflammatory and repair/remodeling transcripts. We also show that unexpected pro-inflammatory gene patterns at the interface between innate immunity, inflammation and host lipid metabolism, known to play pathogenic roles in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with systemic vascular dysfunction, are transcriptionnally active in the blood cells of DSS children.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
We provide a global while non exhaustive overview of the molecular mechanisms altered in of DSS children and suggest how they may interact to lead to final vascular homeostasis breakdown. We suggest that some mechanisms identified should be considered putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers of progression to DSS.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""StÃ©phanie Devignot"", ids = ""47189705""); list(name = ""CÃ©dric Sapet"", ids = ""6504440""); list(name = ""Veasna Duong"", ids = ""6216744""); list(name = ""AurÃ©lie Bergon"", ids = ""50420216""); list(name = ""Pascal Rihet"", ids = ""4763095""); list(name = ""Sivuth Ong"", ids = ""2440422""); list(name = ""Patrich T.

008483cef10b7034c7b51a0e9b846efeb8a083ac,pwrEWAS: a user-friendly tool for comprehensive power estimation for epigenome wide association studies (EWAS),"BackgroundWhen designing an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation (DNAm) and some exposure(s) or phenotype(s), it is critically important to assess the sample size needed to detect a hypothesized difference with adequate statistical power. However, the complex and nuanced nature of DNAm data makes direct assessment of statistical power challenging. To circumvent these challenges and to address the outstanding need for a user-friendly interface for EWAS power evaluation, we have developed pwrEWAS.ResultsThe current implementation of pwrEWAS accommodates power estimation for two-group comparisons of DNAm (e.g. case vs control, exposed vs non-exposed, etc.), where methylation assessment is carried out using the Illumina Human Methylation BeadChip technology. Power is calculated using a semi-parametric simulation-based approach in which DNAm data is randomly generated from beta-distributions using CpG-specific means and variances estimated from one of several different existing DNAm data sets, chosen to cover the most common tissue-types used in EWAS. In addition to specifying the tissue type to be used for DNAm profiling, users are required to specify the sample size, number of differentially methylated CpGs, effect size(s) (Î”Î²), target false discovery rate (FDR) and the number of simulated data sets, and have the option of selecting from several different statistical methods to perform differential methylation analyses. pwrEWAS reports the marginal power, marginal type I error rate, marginal FDR, and false discovery cost (FDC). Here, we demonstrate how pwrEWAS can be applied in practice using a hypothetical EWAS. In addition, we report its computational efficiency across a variety of user settings.ConclusionBoth under- and overpowered studies unnecessarily deplete resources and even risk failure of a study. With pwrEWAS, we provide a user-friendly tool to help researchers circumvent these risks and to assist in the design and planning of EWAS.AvailabilityThe web interface is written in the R statistical programming language using Shiny (RStudio Inc., 2016) and is available at https://biostats-shinyr.kumc.edu/pwrEWAS/.

e0e48c3754dd1850561b2ba598d5a75259baa357,Improved False Discovery Rate Estimation Procedure for Shotgun Proteomics,"Interpreting the potentially vast number of hypotheses generated by a shotgun proteomics experiment requires a valid and accurate procedure for assigning statistical confidence estimates to identified tandem mass spectra. Despite the crucial role such procedures play in most high-throughput proteomics experiments, the scientific literature has not reached a consensus about the best confidence estimation methodology. In this work, we evaluate, using theoretical and empirical analysis, four previously proposed protocols for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with a set of identified tandem mass spectra: two variants of the target-decoy competition protocol (TDC) of Elias and Gygi and two variants of the separate target-decoy search protocol of KÃ¤ll et al. Our analysis reveals significant biases in the two separate target-decoy search protocols. Moreover, the one TDC protocol that provides an unbiased FDR estimate among the target PSMs does so at the cost of forfeiting a random subset of high-scoring spectrum identifications. We therefore propose the mix-max procedure to provide unbiased, accurate FDR estimates in the presence of well-calibrated scores. The method avoids biases associated with the two separate target-decoy search protocols and also avoids the propensity for target-decoy competition to discard a random subset of high-scoring target identifications.",2015,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Uri Keich"", ids = ""2864261""); list(name = ""Attila KertÃ©sz-Farkas"", ids = ""1405603038""); list(name = ""William Stafford Noble"", ids = ""144458655"")",17df1e01bc37a3580ab858ab70f8002fdbacb7f8; 784d5c09cafeaea5a8d269827ce0906c370920d3; f535b3891f35fb7698bc8696d3b7166c82b3af9b; 2d13d6b80a43fba92c195ace8ffbb5d1657d1f3c; 01f80ccac8d1147a2f7bcea36b375795a6f88e6d; cfa2f740cc1f0451f3e7b9e6636253de1300bc0f; a3a8da2e39a5ec224719bb0f65898c258f9f1da1; ee55a7a1ceaa8d1fe5417569a33a453b18096506; a49a77127db546f6060e31e624953fe6eff99318; af11742afdabe84594cbfcc6c741195686f12cb4; 8887d5f6896d1d61baf35704b16654bad6509cd4; fe7cde06c4af9b58915f9f675156adef60297ec2; acbf704a5ec75767946b86124e0f5d43035d7e70; a19ffc4b60b8f86c18c4608e48c14d11df26010a; 0173401e7dcc73eb2f610bc79c0e24cf212e85bc; 84bf48112cac6b9fa7ad8fc4650b556abf7d13ab; 576378060e81d1c47c1282d87235ebf60bd40902; 201335b9ed127f1dd1a7ff18cb9ab46ff64a03b8; a95c6a300cb58bdbfe7cd1f239b04fd4cf5abc50; 26fc554fc3aab6d486e76e7eb27c7606fb28b471; 27822318f2c8dbf5f92a4bd31d395bcca7db45cb; 1f897420cd3af1e0f183740cbf91938a8c8f0e38; 541af5fd448e3c823c83c119faace7a2dfa49541; 56a43d3eda6fcf49dcc4cdcb442046ce7cfede60,821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6,Journal of Proteome Research,14,3148 - 3161
0e12a52b977d2f8175fffcd618f2099bda931929,A two-phase procedure for QTL mapping with regression models,"It is typical in QTL mapping experiments that the number of markers under investigation is large. This poses a challenge to commonly used regression models since the number of feature variables is usually much larger than the sample size, especially, when epistasis effects are to be considered. The greedy nature of the conventional stepwise procedures is well known and is even more conspicuous in such cases. In this article, we propose a two-phase procedure based on penalized likelihood techniques and extended Bayes information criterion (EBIC) for QTL mapping. The procedure consists of a screening phase and a selection phase. In the screening phase, the main and interaction features are alternatively screened by a penalized likelihood mechanism. In the selection phase, a low-dimensional approach using EBIC is applied to the features retained in the screening phase to identify QTL. The two-phase procedure has the asymptotic property that its positive detection rate (PDR) and false discovery rate (FDR) converge to 1 and 0, respectively, as sample size goes to infinity. The two-phase procedure is compared with both traditional and recently developed approaches by simulation studies. A real data analysis is presented to demonstrate the application of the two-phase procedure.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Zehua Chen"", ids = ""121238823""); list(name = ""Wenquan Cui"", ids = ""38467706"")",4e65b13f76a87cc201ccba4f43f27334cf119ce8,ba3021c9fc390c2598e6a5262e73bd90ee6ff074; 85e21edf5df4ba52a9f6c351bf2445df52a13c06; 400b45a803d642b752a84147ef547af7811e8f3f; 37e44d1de8003d8394d158ec6afd1ff0e87e595b; 40c573b3fb9eddcdc54ba2a42603ab3a2889a225; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 2dfc598e231bb43e7dd702c00835e78c7f279efc; 62269cfcfd08541926d78a5c5a0d703b26e189c1; b719662405c578178d82971e97ab852ff3e1db74; b477dd12dd49e44a62c1a303501df5fb6706c7e9; d440eeaf5a78af05fee03adc77c802332e44a615; dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c; d2edf7654e05615b5d769c5e969a4b9030605f1b; 8b10dea0ed714185c5a7c34b693094f1e8327855; 06e15a6da368a59171fe7b9e3260884cfe7a208c; 01c5b6e0b36aea15f712f5423b833f66d8226377; e9af3d5db4d7a6bf025a35e695afbb18ae93fe16; c61149de2d5aca78932729a16c657f811edc63b5; d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e; 49f4143eb35926b031df823eeed0458ed40e2f40; 83d31c8954db6e05cc97b46d26b2bbec0c2b6e35; 702773e40133afd0f967edd333f36f51ace23f6c; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 88a2f5129a01f5a7b1a2bb4e802d046822f65a39; 5465039cf813ab9181ca0a355b61c344e1c2e517; 1991dc5e413d6d6a281bd23e4cc220f7e93a703f; 8056486236e7573957507a090e1f37d95dd741a7; c9f5723859a665c3e54b8d9a1a7eecb8b5084af6; 58db9852fedd50a4732e3c174383710422c32ecc; 9871b0d2e1adeea1af1b35f20162d8b0d8542f6f; 96be493d2d823b6531579f2bb48ea766db0f5897; c7a8bbcc6cc7c50d2edb48db5ae4b336ecaa892f; 055538aed1d84b1217b7d084adf6a3be6c5cebda; b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5; 24779c50338d9947a3d01152cc6597ff4d240513,Theoretical and Applied Genetics,121,363-372
8c306cbd49046bd994c4cc5b2317246156ba9cd2,Gene expression changes in blood RNA after swimming in a chlorinated pool.,"Exposure to disinfection by-products (DBP) such as trihalomethanes (THM) in swimming pools has been linked to adverse health effects in humans, but their biological mechanisms are unclear. We evaluated short-term changes in blood gene expression of adult recreational swimmers after swimming in a chlorinated pool. Volunteers swam 40min in an indoor chlorinated pool. Blood samples were drawn and four THM (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform) were measured in exhaled breath before and after swimming. Intensity of physical activity was measured as metabolic equivalents (METs). Gene expression in whole blood mRNA was evaluated using IlluminaHumanHT-12v3 Expression-BeadChip. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the relationship between gene expression changes and THM exposure. Thirty-seven before-after pairs were analyzed. The median increase from baseline to after swimming were: 0.7 to 2.3 for MET, and 1.4 to 7.1Î¼g/m3 for exhaled total THM (sum of the four THM). Exhaled THM increased on average 0.94Î¼g/m3 per 1 MET. While 1643 probes were differentially expressed post-exposure. Of them, 189 were also associated with exhaled levels of individual/total THM or MET after False Discovery Rate. The observed associations with the exhaled THM were low to moderate (Log-fold change range: -0.17 to 0.15). In conclusion, we identified short-term gene expression changes associated with swimming in a pool that were minor in magnitude and their biological meaning was unspecific. The high collinearity between exhaled THM levels and intensity of physical activity precluded mutually adjusted models with both covariates. These exploratory results should be validated in future studies.",2017,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Lucas A.

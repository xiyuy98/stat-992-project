39c8d284edc7796c54675bfcd984b944696c6d88,Minimum Description Length and Empirical Bayes Methods of Identifying SNPs Associated with Disease,"The goal of determining which of hundreds of thousands of SNPs are associated with disease poses one of the most challenging multiple testing problems. Using the empirical Bayes approach, the local false discovery rate (LFDR) estimated using popular semiparametric models has enjoyed success in simultaneous inference. However, the estimated LFDR can be biased because the semiparametric approach tends to overestimate the proportion of the non-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). One of the negative consequences is that, like conventional p-values, such LFDR estimates cannot quantify the amount of information in the data that favors the null hypothesis of no disease-association. We address this problem of the semiparametric approach by proposing two simple parametric methods under the minimum description length (MDL) and empirical Bayes frameworks. The performances of the estimators corresponding to the two proposed parametric models and of the popular semiparametric model are compared by simulation to select a method for analyzing genome-wide association data. The application of the coronary artery disease data indicates that the semiparametric method sometimes leads to overfitting due to nonparametric density estimation. Unlike semiparametric methods, the analyses based on the two parametric models can measure the amount of information in the data that favors one hypothesis over another.

d3fa4a7a71d17bd193561d1b240a167b2316dfc0,Empirical methods for controlling false positives and estimating confidence in ChIP-Seq peaks,"BackgroundHigh throughput signature sequencing holds many promises, one of which is the ready identification of in vivo transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications, changes in chromatin structure and patterns of DNA methylation across entire genomes. In these experiments, chromatin immunoprecipitation is used to enrich for particular DNA sequences of interest and signature sequencing is used to map the regions to the genome (ChIP-Seq). Elucidation of these sites of DNA-protein binding/modification are proving instrumental in reconstructing networks of gene regulation and chromatin remodelling that direct development, response to cellular perturbation, and neoplastic transformation.ResultsHere we present a package of algorithms and software that makes use of control input data to reduce false positives and estimate confidence in ChIP-Seq peaks. Several different methods were compared using two simulated spike-in datasets. Use of control input data and a normalized difference score were found to more than double the recovery of ChIP-Seq peaks at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Moreover, both a binomial p-value/q-value and an empirical FDR were found to predict the true FDR within 2â€“3 fold and are more reliable estimators of confidence than a global Poisson p-value. These methods were then used to reanalyze Johnson et al.'s neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) ChIP-Seq data without relying on extensive qPCR validated NRSF sites and the presence of NRSF binding motifs for setting thresholds.ConclusionThe methods developed and tested here show considerable promise for reducing false positives and estimating confidence in ChIP-Seq data without any prior knowledge of the chIP target.

56625a447c72d965f046537ca2f4c2a29e60b106,A likelihood ratio approach for functional localization in fMRI,"BACKGROUND
To increase power when analyzing fMRI data, researchers often define functional regions of interest (fROIs). It is crucial that this fROI is defined with an optimal balance between both false positives and false negatives to ensure maximal spatial accuracy and to avoid potentially biased results in the main fMRI experiment. Additionally, since the fROI is defined in each subject separately, the used method should attune to the general level of activation of the individual.


NEW METHOD
We investigate the benefits of the maximized likelihood ratio (mLR) method. This method is based on the likelihood paradigm where likelihood ratios are used to reflect relative statistical evidence in favor of an a priori defined practically relevant alternative hypothesis as compared to the null hypothesis of no activation.


RESULTS
Through both simulations and real data, we show that the mLR method provides cumulative evidence for voxels that are active with an effect size that is larger than the one a priori defined in the alternative. Furthermore, an optimal balance between Type I and Type II errors is achieved when the alternative is an underestimation of the true effect size.


COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS
The mLR method is compared with false discovery rate corrected null hypothesis significance testing and regular likelihood ratio testing. It performs as good as or outperformed both methods in both detection of practically relevant voxels and the trade- off between false positives and false negatives.


CONCLUSIONS
The mLR method provides fROIs that are both spatially accurate and practically relevant.",2020,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jasper Degryse"", ids = ""15700016""); list(name = ""B. Moerkerke"", ids = ""4937155"")",,,Journal of Neuroscience Methods,330,

Correctly interpreting results of multiple simultaneous tests requires a higher standard of evidence than is the case when evaluating results of a single test, and this has been known in the atmospheric sciences literature for more than a century. Even so, the issue continues to be widely ignored, leading routinely to overstatement and overinterpretation of scientific results, to the detriment of the discipline. This paper reviews the history of the multiple-testing issue within the atmospheric sciences literature and illustrates a statistically principled and computationally easy approach to dealing with itâ€”namely, control of the false discovery rate.",2016,Physics,"list(name = ""Daniel S.

bbd4827dc38731e8ea1d5370d983287e160c7b5d,Transcriptome profiling of the newborn mouse lung response to acute ozone exposure.,"Ozone pollution is associated with adverse effects on respiratory health in adults and children but its effects on the neonatal lung remain unknown. This study was carried out to define the effect of acute ozone exposure on the neonatal lung and to profile the transcriptome response. Newborn mice were exposed to ozone or filtered air for 3h. Total RNA was isolated from lung tissues at 6 and 24h after exposure and was subjected to microarray gene expression analysis. Compared to filtered air-exposed littermates, ozone-exposed newborn mice developed a small but significant neutrophilic airway response associated with increased CXCL1 and CXCL5 expression in the lung. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 455 genes were down-regulated and 166 genes were up-regulated by at least 1.5-fold at 6h post-ozone exposure (t-test, p < .05). At 24h, 543 genes were down-regulated and 323 genes were up-regulated in the lungs of ozone-exposed, compared to filtered air-exposed, newborn mice (t-test, p < .05). After controlling for false discovery rate, 50 genes were identified as significantly down-regulated and only a few (RORC, GRP, VREB3, and CYP2B6) were up-regulated at 24h post-ozone exposure (q < .05). Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that cell cycle-associated functions including cell division/proliferation were the most impacted pathways, which were negatively regulated by ozone exposure, an adverse effect that was associated with reduced bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation. These results demonstrate that acute ozone exposure alters cell proliferation in the developing neonatal lung through a global suppression of cell cycle function.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Kelsa Gabehart"", ids = ""5378269""); list(name = ""Kelly A.

b02a7ddb6e5cba9f94f14f79bd16f3cc1074234c,Controlling the False Discovery Rate of the Association/Causality Structure Learned with the PC Algorithm,"In real world applications, graphical statistical models are not only a tool for operations such as classification or prediction, but usually the network structures of the models themselves are also of great interest (e.g., in modeling brain connectivity). The false discovery rate (FDR), the expected ratio of falsely claimed connections to all those claimed, is often a reasonable error-rate criterion in these applications. However, current learning algorithms for graphical models have not been adequately adapted to the concerns of the FDR. The traditional practice of controlling the type I error rate and the type II error rate under a conventional level does not necessarily keep the FDR low, especially in the case of sparse networks. In this paper, we propose embedding an FDR-control procedure into the PC algorithm to curb the FDR of the skeleton of the learned graph. We prove that the proposed method can control the FDR under a user-specified level at the limit of large sample sizes. In the cases of moderate sample size (about several hundred), empirical experiments show that the method is still able to control the FDR under the user-specified level, and a heuristic modification of the method is able to control the FDR more accurately around the user-specified level. The proposed method is applicable to any models for which statistical tests of conditional independence are available, such as discrete models and Gaussian models.",2009,Computer Science; Mathematics,"list(name = ""Junning Li"", ids = ""34959277""); list(name = ""Zhen Jane Wang"", ids = ""1859192"")",a2a52040cb57adf6f93cabe69f801f2a384ee67a; 9fe0c2a48a779c78409f1160a4b250e0ab88f870; b4defdf53fd21cb949dd53c325ddee91317ac0ca; 2dfc7767b5f3aaa1f709c43217d49844a0ff9885; e8481761c7e30fb9900fbc3eae95f01e115a79b5; 74fd4aa58871b4c70b33ef0bae3f09785c005057; a8954a25842af0da2c881b51c4d84edb62420789; 34b09eefdd4fe68df227333828b07e824a4d243f; 508819cc8cca8e02465de279d64a5a273280a36b; 415f14361e4ac9c499a851faeee4f5d6e1af41b9; 92dbd31515a351cb0d7aae42a251f71b7b32de3c; 302b641787001f2211f54ffccda15003aa5a348c; 6169d55b922a3615e8d68d5abb697f98e998c370; f51b20b8503b92a3a32adee581ffea5978e55728; 4c6901c3eb3f618788541daebd4442e10136e768; 64b5a96fc8686719a6fe79f3070835a17f8f2b8c; b2352ed15b4255a9cb49d9493cb379757e8c0b64; 91930de77bdfbae0839776126cfca3d3a6ef5b2a; 738f7e55f9e60e92998b378c751135961d533a55; fbbf12dde8dd333f666e42207f2512ff99fc1db3; 449bde085d91ca300b4b946212280c674266833a; 6674b57a9046cca5e4810bee4de58edfe2ab541c; 20bcb9e1b75a3ccd1450621aff336c340c108010; 0e2cc73acdb6defe6d4f97360c91f84f1bf56a00; cba23735e05009c0d0318964bf2ca69c91837293; 871997584991f0ff3b28122fc0dee65b33f5cfd7; a439058a6a6edead8c8ac212c0a5ab251e9c2fb2; d76cdb60dbd334e5f37b8b702c20974d05d4df07; 4f636109dcd0bfb13c364eb9293d20708eaf4905; a110e4b4fbf05202424ca05b229633c067845ac0; 3b3be1d28fe3eb02b16623130e59a4c915c9dbca; 71144ec4a8e4dd09bd2993f3887f6554b2ace45c; ba06084f98796393ded8140fb97c26477a009ea2; 94dfe5c4449985c1b081384e2a8eeeb9c3c96371; 38fec71f686aaf55c65e081998cee5ffe9c0278c; ff2c21e3e630b42a0a01c0d5ddc5768c0428cee6; 72c7148cb197f1bbe944ca0c0ba423e95514a759; 4e5eaec66a1539a982f92bffce9382b5afbfae97; 467809701c87d9115a293359826a2987d638ba24; 63bbd7df38ad93c0efb2927883368732054663fe; a942b83e7b3817c0b3ed1e4d21104fb1490e6b80; 871234602cdc7fba19539ab6c8634790058ff9ad; 0709c84eca24e2371358c5eb9e7942fad8ce4de8; 9af21b138061326c9add932cb2cb085fb16d7345; e407932a03ee45a7bad33ca3ad7b3d0b0f751a4c; c648ccd009c2ad2db9f937e662505cb4794d4871; 517d9f12aedd7b0be99b39e97dea5c541d74587f; 90bfda131b354cf41a9c2e6596625ac5f57e1ec3; c728626d4e5310d85e86b6c5a0002a89277a4618; 3ea2f6ef2de29d79fbfb6406a8b2fe639891e190; 46e80bb3565b1ca06360d3c64d18fe015c6ccfbb; 44dc704f84b290bbac8c4e9006429233cafec92c; 6d6f5a16feaf7551d65ab02fbd1dcd2e6d84a647; 6f028f8df4f32e3e3375a29a02d99131431c8699; 469e19b34e4c50779be6dae3b176930e1c861255,d3a603ea9664d3dc8911875e16d1fd22e46cd10b; ade157c4ddb211819914c17e4efde6d33489e3b5; 79c7d6903e12e1b45bb3f8bc6ca862fed92b06ea; 1103f496df55451486b037a2869af495f109aac0; c549bf3bb644705fe9a3ffed9dac83a2401f4fa6; 07e6b38dc70fc45e50ee780f36e767bed15544fb; 1beba69cdaedd78a8a02b080bdd4f0183590c98e; 507c9b4917638d77b0bad5df47edff92f2ff229a; cce9f26d9ae328c51b61434b6f5623a2becdf857; 9dc134b18c06577354d50c12a8972b965d3bbacd; 6b4ac6a4d556522ba08a9b609203d2843b0d4fd2; 971e3d2070315f0f6fb511616874605290e72fbd; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; 31592816ac2c50ec22bcef38052d9dcc20a9171c; a135c121abdab6cac4132b82f303d9b89d0f3db7; 2086fe71a443512cd7efe50828fef81be59fe719; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4,J.

 Abstract
 
 Marek's disease virus (MDV), which causes a lymphoproliferative disease in chickens, is known to induce host responses leading to protection against disease in a manner dependent on genetic background of chickens and virulence of the virus. In the present study, changes in the spleen proteome at 7, 14 and 21Â days post-infection in response to MDV infection were studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using one-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (1D LC ESI MS/MS). Comparative analysis of multiple gels revealed that the majority of changes had occurred at early stages of the disease. In total, 61 protein spots representing 48 host proteins were detected as either quantitatively (false discovery rate (FDR)â‰¤0.05 and fold changeâ‰¥2) or qualitatively differentially expressed at least once during different sampling points. Overall, the proteins identified in the present study are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as the antigen processing and presentation, ubiquitinâ€“proteasome protein degradation (UPP), formation of the cytoskeleton, cellular metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of translation. Notably, early stages of the disease were characterized by changes in the UPP, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, changes indicative of active cell proliferation as well as apoptosis together with significant changes in cytoskeletal components that were observed throughout the experimental period suggested the complexity of the pathogenesis. The present findings provide a basis for further studies aimed at elucidation of the role of these proteins in MDV interactions with its host.

In a first experiment on whole-genome association analysis in rapeseed, 684 mapped AFLP markers were tested for association with 14 traits in a set of 84 canola quality winter rapeseed cultivars. For association analysis a general linear model was used. By testing significance of marker-trait associations against a false discovery rate of 0.2, between 1 and 34 associated markers were found for 10 of the 14 traits. Taking into account linkage disequilibrium between the significant markers, these markers represent between 1 and 22 putative QTL for the respective traits. The minimum phenotypic variance explained by the QTL for the different traits ranged from 15% to 53%. A subset of 27 markers were significantly associated with two or more traits. These markers were predominantly shared between traits that were significantly correlated at the phenotypic level. The results show clearly that in rapeseed, QTL mapping by association analysis is a viable alternative to QTL mapping in segregating populations.",2010,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nora Honsdorf"", ids = ""50567380""); list(name = ""Heiko C.

5d2938d774358a2be52c47fea4031cff87d76c25,Role of Lncrnas in Early Stage Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Variable Region (IGHV) Unmutated CLL Disease Progression,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains a heterogeneous disease despite significant advances in disease classification based upon cellular and molecular markers. Rai stage, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status (IGHV), cytogenetic abnormalities, beta 2 microglobulin levels, expression of ZAP-70, CD38 and CD49d provide useful guides alone or in prognostic models for progression risk assessment but variability in clinical outcome in early Rai stage (Rai 0/I) unmutated (UM) IGHV patients persists. This variability in clinical outcome suggests that there are yet-to-be defined biologic/genetic factors that contribute to disease heterogeneity. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) display a range of diverse activities including regulation of gene transcription, post translational regulation and epigenetic regulation and represent an intriguing prospect for influencing CLL disease progression. LncRNAs have been implicated in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of various cancers however their role in influencing disease progression in early Rai stage UM CLL has not yet been studied. Methods: To investigate a role for lncRNAs in UM Rai 0/I CLL patients we employed the Arraystar Human lncRNA Microarray v4.0. Using blood samples collected within 3 months of diagnosis, two cohorts of UM Rai 0/I patients were compared: one defined as progressive disease with time to first treatment (TTT) â‰¤ 2 years after diagnosis (n=34) and one as indolent disease with TTT â‰¥5 years after diagnosis (n=29). Differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using Agilent GeneSpring GX Software v12.1. To be considered for further analysis, the difference in lncRNA expression had to have a fold change (FC) â‰¥ 2.0, a t-test p-value â‰¤ 0.05 and a false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.05. Results: Over 1100 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between the progressive and indolent UM CLL cohorts. Greater than 150 of these lncRNAs have known associated genes and are well annotated and validated. Among the differentially expressed lncRNAs, several are of particular interest and potentially relevant to CLL disease biology. For example, the lncRNA AL833181 was overexpressed in the progressive group. The associated gene for AL833181 is BCL11A and encodes a zinc finger protein that interacts with BCL6 and may itself serve as a proto-oncogene. Translocations involving BCL11A have been shown to identify a very aggressive subset of CLL (Am J Pathology, 2009). Therefore it is possible this lncRNA may be playing a role in deregulated expression of BCL11A. Within the indolent disease group, CTD-2566J3.1 was overexpressed >10-fold as compared to the progressive disease group. Its associated gene RAD51B is essential for DNA repair, suggesting the possibility that CTD-2566J3 may protect CLL cells from further DNA damage and disease progression. Also overexpressed in the indolent disease group were 2 lncRNAs that are associated with genes that encode proteins involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. USP2-AS1 lncRNA is associated with the USP2 gene and encodes an ubiquitin-specific protease required for TNF-alpha induced NF-kB signaling and is a specific deubiquitinase for cyclin D1, a known proto-oncogene. Furthermore, USP2-AS1 may also be linked to MYC. RP11-522I20.3 is associated with the QBLN1gene which encodes a protein that mediates the proteasomal degradation of misfolded or accumulated proteins. Thus, the associated lncRNAs may be acting as post-transcriptional gene silencers. Although CLL is not viewed as an ""invasive"" cancer, there were 5 lncRNAs overexpressed in the indolent group that are associated with Ankyrin genes which play a role in cell motility, activation and proliferation along with the lncRNA RP11-477D19 that is associated with theTIAM2 gene. TIAM2is a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that can promote invasion and motility of cells. The respective lncRNAs may be down-regulating these genes and prohibiting malignant cell expansion. Conclusions: Our study reveals that there are indeed specific lncRNAs that are expressed at different levels in progressive versus indolent early Rai stage UM CLL and have the potential to impact a number of relevant biological processes and pathways. While these data are preliminary, the lncRNA AL833181 and its associated gene BCL11A may prove to be a potential marker and therapeutic target for aggressive disease.

0a7886a13ea5c828d3f4e025da415fcc2a76ffa8,Proteomic analysis of mTOR inhibition-mediated phosphorylation changes in ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic translation initiation factors,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as a critical energy sensor and cell-growth regulator, controls protein synthesis, autophagy and many important cellular processes through forming functional distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 that is sensitive to rapamycin, regulates cell growth and protein synthesis, while mTORC2 that is insensitive to rapamycin, regulates cellular metabolism and the cytoskeletal organization (Gingras et al., 2001; Hay and Sonenberg, 2004). Translation initiation is the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis, which proceeds through a multistep process that can be divided into three major steps. First, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) binds with GTP and methionyl-tRNA to form the ternary complex, which further binds to 40S ribosomal subunit with the help of eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3 and eIF5 resulting the preinitiation complex (PIC). Second, the PIC binds to mRNA which is unwinded by the eIF4F complex (including eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B). Finally, the second GTPase, eIF5B catalyzes the joining of the 60S subunit and 40S subunit to form the 80S initiation complex (Jackson et al., 2010). mTORC1 regulates activities of a number of constituents of protein synthesis, including translation initiation factors and elongation factors, through phosphorylating two well-known substrates, the ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2) (Gingras et al., 2001; Hay and Sonenberg, 2004). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 increases the availability of eIF4E. Phosphorylation of eIF4B by S6K1 is necessary for PIC formation (Gingras et al., 2001). Ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) which is the substrate of S6K1 and S6K2, involves in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell size and glucose homeostasis (Ruvinsky et al., 2005). However, systematic analysis of mTORC1 mediated phosphorylation in ribosomal and associated proteins has not been achieved. To analyze mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation in ribosomal and associated proteins, quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis basedon theSILAC (stable isotope labeling byamino acids in cell culture) method was carried out to analyze affinity enriched phosphoproteins from the untreated and rapamycintreated 293Tcells. The experimental workflow was displayed in Fig. 1A. Briefly, cells grown in light medium (C6 N2-Lysine and C6-Arginine, K R) were treated with 200 nmol/L rapamycin for 2 h, while cells grown in heavy medium (C6 N2Lysine and C6-Arginine, K R) were untreated. Sucrose cushion centrifugation was used to isolate ribosomes. Proteins extracted from the whole cell lysate or the isolated ribosome fraction of the untreated and rapamycin-treated cells were mixed and trypsin digested. Then phosphopeptides were enrichedwith TiO2 beads and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/ MS. The generated MS/MS spectra were searched against the human database using the Sequest search engine in the Proteome Discoverer (Version 1.4) software, with the false discovery rate (FDR) setting to 0.01. We identified 61 unique phosphorylation sites on 37 ribosomal proteins, among which 33 phosphorylation sites have been reported before in the Uniprot database (http://www. uniprot.org). Abundance of 28 phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 31 phosphorylation sites were decreased after rapamycin-treatment (Fig. 1B), of which 12 were from 9 proteins of the 40S ribosome, and 16 were from 12 proteins of the 60S ribosome. Quantitative proteomics using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) was carried out and showed that 2-h rapamycin treatment did not induce changes in the expression levels of ribosomal proteins (Table S1). This indicated that phosphorylation changes in these proteins were caused by inhibition of mTOR. We further identified that 14 phosphorylated peptides possessed three types of consensus sequence motifs using iceLogo (http://iomics.ugent.be/icelogoserver/) (Fig. 1C and Table S2), including proline-directed motif (SP and TP), which was the known mTOR targeted phosphorylation sites, the ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)-targeted arginine-rich motif (RRRxS), and the acidic motif (SxxD/E/pS) that was the potential substrate of casein kinase II (CKII) predicted using KinasePhos (http://kinasephos.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/).",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Xu Jiang"", ids = ""49835925""); list(name = ""Shan Feng"", ids = ""144766378""); list(name = ""Yuling Chen"", ids = ""4704296""); list(name = ""Yun Feng"", ids = ""144325330""); list(name = ""Haiteng Deng"", ids = ""2172636"")",05291a5f0caf22239cca7ff44e4a716b6abcdf57; 960a1f9962fe4c69112f35a4b0494b95e8d08091; b0edf7539e4e3867cd2f6d2b92360536c53422f3; 5399c386b94518099bee747c8a084ffd33bb2831,6f98df7393e1453d7edef37b8146cf34090e2952; 6cc587dfd131e4f3485c62c755300a797913e27b; c39f6dd2d36b32dfe2669cefa8254eb3785d1145; 27065027b1b58b7a6f23e0e1075df143ea3e3eac; e8f471e181486c985bdbfa663be06d4998ab47ea; 8ca82e663d2d2e650e56ffce8c596099741a4201; 823a07348204dcaa314e193075f9dc2614db538c; d26bed3de92406d5ce01fe8f9e0c31634647001e; 1169d54e013f6646586e94cbc1b213341d420dcd; d7263e43879ac275919c19886711f2b221159872; 3c44aeb32bd258354e6d1da5b9a15cd53bd1ce23,Protein & Cell,7,533 - 537
5554ce71d078723f6e35729af43a92d1136e86fb,Using surface electromyography (SEMG) to classify low back pain based on lifting capacity evaluation with principal component analysis neural network method,"Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability. The population with low back pain is continuously growing in the recent years. This study tries to distinguish LBP patients with healthy subjects by using the objective surface electromyography (SEMG) as a quantitative score for clinical evaluations. There are 26 healthy and 26 low back pain subjects who involved in this research. They lifted different weights by static and dynamic lifting process. Multiple features are extracted from the raw SEMG data, including energy and frequency indexes. Moreover, false discovery rate (FDR) omitted the false positive features. Then, a principal component analysis neural network (PCANN) was used for classifications. The results showed the features with different loadings (including 30%, and 50% loading) on lifting which can be used for distinguishing healthy and back pain subjects.

Gene expression profiling is an important tool for gaining insight into biology. Novel strategies are required to analyze the growing archives of microarray data and extract useful information from them. One area of interest is in the construction of gene association networks from collections of profiling data. Various approaches have been proposed to construct gene networks using profiling data, and these networks have been used in functional inference as well as in data visualization. Here, we investigated a non-parametric approach to translate profiling data into a gene network. We explored the characteristics and utility of the resulting network and investigated the use of network information in analysis of variance models and hypothesis testing.


RESULTS
Our work is composed of two parts: gene network construction and partitioning and hypothesis testing using sub-networks as groups. In the first part, multiple independently collected microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository were analyzed to identify probe pairs that are positively co-regulated across the samples. A co-expression network was constructed based on a reciprocal ranking criteria and a false discovery rate analysis. We named this network Reference Gene Association (RGA) network. Then, the network was partitioned into densely connected sub-networks of probes using a multilevel graph partitioning algorithm. In the second part, we proposed a new, MANOVA-based approach that can take individual probe expression values as input and perform hypothesis testing at the sub-network level. We applied this MANOVA methodology to two published studies and our analysis indicated that the methodology is both effective and sensitive for identifying transcriptional sub-networks or pathways that are perturbed across treatments.",2007,Computer Science; Medicine,"list(name = ""Duygu Ucar"", ids = ""145026082""); list(name = ""Isaac Neuhaus"", ids = ""49997209""); list(name = ""Petra Ross-MacDonald"", ids = ""1404519962""); list(name = ""Charles Tilford"", ids = ""16797934""); list(name = ""Srinivasan Parthasarathy"", ids = ""145022640""); list(name = ""Nathan O.

71493af61363dbed91225e605c83a404d2c29738,Occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with differential DNA methylation,"OBJECTIVES
Occupational pesticide exposure is associated with a wide range of diseases, including lung diseases, but it is largely unknown how pesticides influence airway disease pathogenesis. A potential mechanism might be through epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation. Therefore, we assessed associations between occupational exposure to pesticides and genome-wide DNA methylation sites.


METHODS
1561 subjects of LifeLines were included with either no (n=1392), low (n=108) or high (n=61) exposure to any type of pesticides (estimated based on current or last held job). Blood DNA methylation levels were measured using Illumina 450K arrays. Associations between pesticide exposure and 420â€‰938 methylation sites (CpGs) were assessed using robust linear regression adjusted for appropriate confounders. In addition, we performed genome-wide stratified and interaction analyses by gender, smoking and airway obstruction status, and assessed associations between gene expression and methylation for genome-wide significant CpGs (n=2802).


RESULTS
In total for all analyses, high pesticide exposure was genome-wide significantly (false discovery rate P<0.05) associated with differential DNA methylation of 31 CpGs annotated to 29 genes. Twenty of these CpGs were found in subjects with airway obstruction. Several of the identified genes, for example, RYR1, ALLC, PTPRN2, LRRC3B, PAX2 and VTRNA2-1, are genes previously linked to either pesticide exposure or lung-related diseases. Seven out of 31 CpGs were associated with gene expression levels.


CONCLUSIONS
We show for the first time that occupational exposure to pesticides is genome-wide associated with differential DNA methylation. Further research should reveal whether this differential methylation plays a role in the airway disease pathogenesis induced by pesticides.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Diana A van der Plaat"", ids = ""13186324""); list(name = ""Kim de Jong"", ids = ""5243454""); list(name = ""Maaike de Vries"", ids = ""144681293""); list(name = ""Cleo C. van Diemen"", ids = ""3604296""); list(name = ""Ivana Nedeljkovic"", ids = ""49425815""); list(name = ""Najaf Amin"", ids = ""2341969""); list(name = ""Hans Kromhout"", ids = ""2581089""); list(name = ""Roel C H Vermeulen"", ids = ""50662867""); list(name = ""Dirkje S Postma"", ids = ""4173369""); list(name = ""Cornelia M. van Duijn"", ids = ""145102347""); list(name = ""H Marike Boezen"", ids = ""144080259""); list(name = ""Judith M Vonk"", ids = ""4183813"")",09636d2b8117dc69a1bf61d50ddd5904948ac296; b053ba3dee0aad005fd4ca4e4d37b1f3a56a60ce; b410642bd1f75a62ddaf2e0dd578da8cf8435e6b; 29824f768297b44175c1db45f7807ad9439f38d3; 559dc3b604977238c54e4af774ad43b48fcbf859; b8306a5aa066c1123c1a905b11a8fa7368d4e347; c347eb55e4d6b5e78e41e6cd341eb3f435e5ebbf; d61efe15d8483e89b1be9005de3a4cd77ad8d28e,70e360ae6be32e606f4f6596b2dc0ab120f34e05; ba6a48a4e8a9a34e845784fc9170612fdd2cd564; 9cd8dd866e23b0ddedc690bdba10a135ef07e8f6; 8491609f317f23cd17b3982518cffa932c7cd80f; e81930da5dcf27fab0a5d3adf3858f8a53f3263d; bd6b842e54e93b99dc997c87e607511fc6da5e31; 0d8e44498218c686005653731d8d49b315a0ec32; 38720baa29930d6f47cc5ab22976be048fd92e1f; 9c63be748d6f9fe05a931f947fd6d34a474e1a14; c73fd0ccd7be53074084c3789895d0006d3b26ab; e53eb681e43bc799d5e7e7f2cec8d6ff43b162a2; dcc6421bf005bbc040a9f93a325e14172ff2d848; 60e54f5c56b9e7a851eed6bc7e662f3ebfa34816; 97a25fca40430acf0e25ffb0dd22f19df5c9d1ad; 518bdcc72dbd6e4a8101c156dd5b2bc202102435; 0922916e301dddc244e83afa51d47aae7a6594a7; 2f045e4dfa3ec3a7251b6ecd67b5902b99767bc5; 76f15600c2b05e039c8fcd3e9942a4c686236d20; 4a3479cad4dc9902095f647a103065568b25e000; fec5682fc6dab1e470d582e8622b9a3b342ded5e; c7e6d7b8733bf66072db0c20fdac5dfdf95eee23; 940a0d5ab0bd11c0791d0507034ae9ad5148a947; 6fcb91683ae4e975c8c23482d1d763b0d415a091; a3163cfa819ee5198579c92b19df91c067951339; f0d08516ca14ba0f786afde9a7f73a0a2f0b2f3d; 71d883bed94aa704c59cb308eb57805212b86e2f; 6875f7fef476491094ee5556e9eacffa94d0d791; da1508ae4a6ad4d4acaba51b9023036b7d5496e8; 0acb5207a400a026f0caa12bdeeb1c13db9c161c; 9c6493eaef11e187601a1ecced0d25ed0875d22b; ba5095a1be3cd13345062d112d42c363af6fac07; d5612a50a36de13f5712b1cc4bac93703064994c; ccdbe52c631220ccb2f7654c434b02e25a457893; 22f912323e9087a133aac125f3a1e2174661620b; 0f9bf662805a2ad14e7a0eb5d4e464ba4043f5e5; 1dfac404e4fd75e479820c024d4f3ef17ee4b0d3; e2029f59ebc344616d155665eb89cef155bdade9; 5fe7b82e53064ce3763d9016ca1937b90d0f1a9b; 7e44e19a3688686d176fb58a8f825546b087a8e7; be210fa51243e2494274558d7478088b141c0a9c; 8f230dd4a6154d6cf2418d2e60d959a7f4a9feab; 0fbc4d82a2e1f7f8b39956d77607a9549c5c91a8; a33abd62ccb1c1c32229365f1aca44af8cb2a340,Occupational and Environmental Medicine,75,427 - 435

OFFgel fractionation in the first dimension was effective in providing an additional dimension of separation, orthogonal to RP nano-LC, thus generating an off-line multidimensional separation platform that proved to be robust and easy to set up. The analysis identified 1373 proteins with high confidence (false discovery rate<0.25%). The core set of 1373 human platelet proteins was investigated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software from which ten canonical pathways and eight networks have been validated, to suggest that platelets behave either as inflammatory or immune cells, and plasma membrane and cytoskeleton proteins play a fundamental role in their function. Moreover, toxicity pathway in agreement with network analysis, supports the concept that platelet life span is governed by an apoptotic mechanism.",2011,Medicine; Chemistry,"list(name = ""Shibu Krishnan"", ids = ""40646523""); list(name = ""Marco Gaspari"", ids = ""144666137""); list(name = ""Anna Della Corte"", ids = ""49005245""); list(name = ""Patrizia Bianchi"", ids = ""46850711""); list(name = ""Marilena Crescente"", ids = ""49868700""); list(name = ""Chiara Cerletti"", ids = ""118247331""); list(name = ""Daniele Torella"", ids = ""6047779""); list(name = ""Ciro Indolfi"", ids = ""1709144""); list(name = ""Giovanni de Gaetano"", ids = ""1380987553""); list(name = ""Maria Benedetta Donati"", ids = ""50194494""); list(name = ""Domenico Rotilio"", ids = ""3853745""); list(name = ""Giovanni Cuda"", ids = ""1932008"")",7d8d41ce70f788554470b5202bcd2964b609b95a; 0969488051f4a7c4cf253874f2b0b058bce15e08; 4171721417c5e7585c63bf8928488c9611a1fe19; f3297d548610225aba579f1a42a69202e303d6de; 49c3ac43891b9435856bcf73f6e68756132cb1da; af006a5bebb0ed9520d4591499ce591eb1333d5b; e97ae1b034de00576423504c2debf613fee31693; 6d0792366a584739845c212c5a6706b20da37f0a; d19c42aa814187c915bd316f771f65f83dcbb657; 32916e1b7d1cf0306e2d9a0470e4aa7f14327ad0; ba187047121b7c30b1915c0f2775c853192a5510,,Electrophoresis,32 6-7,"

2fc9aab35ffd3443102f6b947c0fb75d572be279,Validation of whole-blood transcriptome signature during microdose recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) administration,"BackgroundRecombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) can improve human performance and is therefore frequently abused by athletes. As a result, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) introduced the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) as an indirect method to detect blood doping. Despite this progress, challenges remain to detect blood manipulations such as the use of microdoses of rHuEpo.MethodsForty-five whole-blood transcriptional markers of rHuEpo previously derived from a high-dose rHuEpo administration trial were used to assess whether microdoses of rHuEpo could be detected in 14 trained subjects and whether these markers may be confounded by exercise (nÂ =Â 14 trained subjects) and altitude training (nÂ =Â 21 elite runners and nÂ =Â 4 elite rowers, respectively). Differential gene expression analysis was carried out following normalisation and significance declared following application of a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) and a 1.5 fold-change. Adaptive model analysis was also applied to incorporate these markers for the detection of rHuEpo.ResultsALAS2, BCL2L1, DCAF12, EPB42, GMPR, SELENBP1, SLC4A1, TMOD1 and TRIM58 were differentially expressed during and throughout the post phase of microdose rHuEpo administration. The CD247 and TRIM58 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively, immediately following exercise when compared with the baseline both before and after rHuEpo/placebo. No significant gene expression changes were found 30Â min after exercise in either rHuEpo or placebo groups. ALAS2, BCL2L1, DCAF12, SLC4A1, TMOD1 and TRIM58 tended to be significantly expressed in the elite runners ten days after arriving at altitude and one week after returning from altitude (FDRâ€‰>â€‰0.059, fold-change varying from 1.39 to 1.63). Following application of the adaptive model, 15 genes showed a high sensitivity (â‰¥ 93%) and specificity (â‰¥ 71%), with BCL2L1 and CSDA having the highest sensitivity (93%) and specificity (93%).ConclusionsCurrent results provide further evidence that transcriptional biomarkers can strengthen the ABP approach by significantly prolonging the detection window and improving the sensitivity and specificity of blood doping detection. Further studies are required to confirm, and if necessary, integrate the confounding effects of altitude training on blood doping.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Guan Wang"", ids = ""145181732""); list(name = ""JÃ©rÃ´me Durussel"", ids = ""49235867""); list(name = ""Jonathan H.

940cce8a9a3db9f95259821082ec2df527998065,Introduction to the Special Section on Advances in Causal Discovery and Inference,"Identification of cause and effect is the ultimate goal for most scientific and social discoveries. Controlled experiments are an effective approach to such discoveries, but they are expensive and sometimes infeasible to conduct. With the advent of big data availability in many areas, finding causal relationships using automated procedures is increasingly possible. With its focus on this challenge, causal discovery and inference is now a fast growing area in machine learning. Graphical causal models, the potential outcome model, and structural equation models are the three major modelling approaches to representation of causal relations and identification of causal effects. They have achieved many successes in various applications. More importantly, the principles and insights of causal inference help to solve several challenging machine-learning problems, such as model explainability, transfer learning, domain adaptation, and lifelong learning [1]. However, causal discovery and inference faces many challenges in theory and practice. They need strong assumptions, some of which are not verifiable in data. There is a lack of ground truth data for real-world evaluation of causal discovery and inference methods. Some of the algorithms whose results have asymptotic theoretical guarantees are not scalable to large and/or highdimensional data. More research is still needed to solve fundamental problems in causal discovery and inference, such as structure learning, false discovery control, assessment of causal discoveries, hidden variables, and nonlinear and/or heterogeneous causal relationships. More real-world applications of causal discovery and inference are also vital. Many workshops and symposia have been organized to meet the increasing research interests and demands in causal discovery and inference. Some associate editors of this special issue have organized four KDD Causal Discovery workshops, from 2016 to 2019. More than 10 other workshops and symposia have been organized in the same period, such as NeurIPS Workshop From â€œWhat If?â€ To â€œWhat Next?â€: Causal Inference and Machine Learning for Intelligent Decision Making in 2017; NeurIPS Workshop Machine Learning and Causal Inference for Improved Decision Making in 2019; UAI Workshop Causation: Foundation to Application, 2016; UAI Workshop Causality: Learning, Inference, and Decision-Making, 2017; and UAI Workshop on Causal Inference, 2018. We edit this special issue to showcase the research achievements in the past few years since the previous special issue on the same topic in 2016 was published in this journal. This special issue collects seven articles that fall into two groups: fundamental problems and applications. The five articles in the first group study the fundamental problems in causal discovery and inference and present novel solutions for false discovery control in structure learning, causal relationship detection in simulation models, causal structure search in the presence of latent confounders, the shortest causal path discovery by local search, and conditional independence test for causal structure learning. Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a fundamental problem. Little research work has studied the strategies for controlling false discovery rates in causal structure learning.

d8e9bb774d3b4be16478208c798f021cdeb3a815,Association of udder traits with single nucleotide polymorphisms in crossbred Bos indicus-Bos taurus cows.,"The size, support, and health of udders limit the productive life of beef cows, especially those with background, because, in general, such cows have a reputation for problems with udders. Genomic association studies of bovine udder traits have been conducted in dairy cattle and recently in Continental European beef breeds but not in cows with background. The objective of this study was to determine associations of SNP and udder support scores, teat length, and teat diameter in half (Nellore), half (Angus) cows. Udders of cows ( = 295) born from 2003 to 2007 were evaluated for udder support and teat length and diameter ( = 1,746 records) from 2005 through 2014. These included a subjective score representing udder support (values of 1 indicated poorly supported, pendulous udders and values of 9 indicated very well-supported udders) and lengths and diameters of individual teats in the 4 udder quarters as well as the average. Cows were in full-sibling or half-sibling families. Residuals for each trait were produced from repeated records models with cow age category nested within birth year of cows. Those residuals were averaged to become the dependent variables for genomewide association analyses. Regression analyses of those dependent variables included genotypic values as explanatory variables for 34,980 SNP from a commercially available array and included the genomic relationship matrix. Fifteen SNP loci on BTA 5 were associated (false discovery rate controlled at 0.05) with udder support score. One of those was also detected as associated with average teat diameter. Three of those 15 SNP were located within genes, including one each in (), (), and (). These are notable for their functional role in some aspect of mammary gland formation or health. Other candidate genes for these traits in the vicinity of the SNP loci include () and (). Because these were detected in Nellore-Angus crossbred cows, which typically have very well-formed udders with excellent support across their productive lives, similar efforts in other breeds should be completed, because that may facilitate further refinement of genomic regions responsible for variation in udder traits important in multiple breeds.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mallory Williams Tolleson"", ids = ""21153118""); list(name = ""Clare Gill"", ids = ""49834335""); list(name = ""Andy D Herring"", ids = ""37553493""); list(name = ""Penny K Riggs"", ids = ""4571847""); list(name = ""Jason E.

81cca7e7af02e943ef2c731bc2043ca05440498a,Comparison of response patterns in different survey designs: a longitudinal panel with mixed-mode and online-only design,"BackgroundIncreasing availability of the Internet allows using only online data collection for more epidemiological studies. We compare response patterns in a population-based health survey using two survey designs: mixed-mode (choice between paper-and-pencil and online questionnaires) and online-only design (without choice).MethodsWe used data from a longitudinal panel, the Hygiene and Behaviour Infectious Diseases Study (HaBIDS), conducted in 2014/2015 in four regions in Lower Saxony, Germany. Individuals were recruited using address-based probability sampling. In two regions, individuals could choose between paper-and-pencil and online questionnaires. In the other two regions, individuals were offered online-only participation. We compared sociodemographic characteristics of respondents who filled in all panel questionnaires between the mixed-mode group (nÂ =Â 1110) and the online-only group (nÂ =Â 482). Using 134 items, we performed multinomial logistic regression to compare responses between survey designs in terms of type (missing, â€œdo not knowâ€ or valid response) and ordinal regression to compare responses in terms of content. We applied the false discovery rates (FDR) to control for multiple testing and investigated effects of adjusting for sociodemographic characteristic. For validation of the differential response patterns between mixed-mode and online-only, we compared the response patterns between paper and online mode among the respondents in the mixed-mode group in one region (nÂ =Â 786).ResultsRespondents in the online-only group were older than those in the mixed-mode group, but both groups did not differ regarding sex or education. Type of response did not differ between the online-only and the mixed-mode group. Survey design was associated with different content of response in 18 of the 134 investigated items; which decreased to 11 after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. In the validation within the mixed-mode, only two of those were among the 11 significantly different items. The probability of observing by chance the same two or more significant differences in this setting was 22%.ConclusionsWe found similar response patterns in both survey designs with only few items being answered differently, likely attributable to chance. Our study supports the equivalence of the compared survey designs and suggests that, in the studied setting, using online-only design does not cause strong distortion of the results.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Nicole RÃ¼bsamen"", ids = ""6065773""); list(name = ""Manas K Akmatov"", ids = ""6297250""); list(name = ""Stefanie Castell"", ids = ""47490332""); list(name = ""AndrÃ© Karch"", ids = ""46564541""); list(name = ""Rafael T Mikolajczyk"", ids = ""3249029"")",09a86f0f1cc4325d3fbf9254063a6492fe9367ad; 5b20354b33549137014658b1c50477696e7502cd; ccf30d76e96d2eec1ae74796cb393705d73b31d3; 58eab55da4449dae0a7337118e356994a0c8c7cf; ce2ab0b11a7dd5eb19dcf87bf74bf3c88b20b5bf; fd9c022bfde7da0913432fa70b32e1b368e0d9fa; c30361cb195cec73d76869638f5713bf4d0d8aa6; 26273f6709f03e8bae8e40155132bf9bc6a4e9a4; 479c07514b33aefd89a35b2f94c42e37c7d35c07; 7932ea69550b2ee8c38a81bfcd304de5c9a952c9; fdb68b5a67285a7eca31baaef4ada7d3dda788cb; b612cc88f247dd13ba23a2a7186d4006b2a33306; 62150fa7a084ea795c5847b72ba5e630c24d64f1; 7e7533cf26e993339d18f64b3f9a71ce4ff43266; 98d41219d892f73f224f01dd3c0025f13a6aa7b5,cd84c7deec48d868cffe8f95576f76a82f8d2118; 3db655e0218c3a2e2fe5ac1d75743bc392f2497a; 687865a2e2683c91c3984bebe470a4401e85c1e0; c2fa495ef43dc0fc032b2c45ed997e3538594c86; 54b79192b3883f0088a68c304abff136f1fa38ce; 0d31fcd97567a9979fec8087335389682e9a0952; 56495e5725c16ff903cf0199b4ada19c6280be52; 0e3d84b384f34acd28e1a1d321e982314d351860; 6b531a36f5fb2b39553406274a47391be131da95; 66aa089febc8071e12b98f636bbbb654d070a6e7; 5db27bbed1b715ef641452507ece502d0b7e9dd5; 38a4e2b306679b6ac0bebf4cb78421eccbd7e13f; 0ec1f10da78f2cfbba421f15c5892cbeaaf88b39; 9fc5f9695a21a2522266afc59c592e67659f634a; e94b0c89523bc2ce6e3f27e7fe1f8e00f9eac8b6; 0155d248c26aafa9ce66b48ad21aa874aa7e1553; a1816ebe2514e2244b13c0693d99ca260a13ac47; 4b6a30b2b50fd19a058a16fd7fa8a48cbf673367; bf556631fead3c3caaafadfa49db2c42c855d86c; b251e0f1a1f2be049f89ce74400bb55b0ea603cd; 5ac4193b3090a5206d51884b1399f5658d8f1ced; 566b5c62fc77292ebe09295d59e7fbf6fc914260; ff12cb6a29323c42497d910919814c64ba2150c3; 9543f7ea610615a45747154038b8bfff4e2e199b; 56161fc547a50e73a97520635be31ce915d40a34; e5a7d7e06f621cc1af2adb9a9f2db20dd5e7fa01; 19ab9e5a095e02531bb440ad9c7a42ceecb39c43; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 546da45c5b65b77c30fd50a05e264ee60f73f526; 43331b12ab2485befa2497083b30a9ca31cad690; 355d5ea3c649975b35ef52bdd0c72a3c79a9ae6a; 94d675c0cf1667864f5889929f4e170b27e75a78,Emerging Themes in Epidemiology,14,
85c889eabb25516c0d7046a11e8ab09fe29d4e72,Associations of GSTM1*0 and GSTA1*A genotypes with the risk of cardiovascular death among hemodialyses patients,"BackgroundThe presence of glutathione transferase (GST) M1 null genotype (GSTM1-null) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is associated with lower overall survival rate in comparison to those with GSTM1-active variants. We examined association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms as well as SNPs in GSTA1/rs3957357 and GSTP1/rs1695 genes with overall and cause-specific cardiovascular mortality in ESRD patients.MethodsTotal of 199 patients undergoing hemodialysis were included in the study. Median value of time elapsed from dialysis initiation until the death, or the end of follow-up was 8â€‰Â±â€‰5 years. The effect of GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTA1 gene polymorphisms on predicting overall and specific cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, MI or stroke) was analyzed using Cox regression model, and differences in survival were determined by Kaplan-Meier.ResultsGSTM1-null genotype in ESRD patients was found to be independent predictor of overall and cardiovascular mortality. However, after false discovery rate and Bonferroni corrections this effect was lost. The borderline effect modification by wild-type GSTA1*A/*A genotype on associations between GSTM1-null and analyzed outcomes was found only for death from stroke. Homozygous carriers of combined GSTM1*0/GSTA1*A genotype exhibited significantly shorter time to death of stroke or MI in comparison with carriers of either GSTM1-active or at least one GSTA1*B gene variant. The best survival rate regarding cardiovascular outcome was found for ESRD patients with combined GSTM1-active and mutant GSTA1*B/*B genotype.ConclusionsCombined GSTM1*0/GSTA1*A genotypes might be considered as genetic markers for cardiovascular death risk in ESRD patients, which may permit targeting of preventive and early intervention.",2014,Medicine,"list(name = ""Sonja Suvakov"", ids = ""4031391""); list(name = ""Tatjana DamjanoviÄ‡"", ids = ""12944436""); list(name = ""Tatjana Pekmezovic"", ids = ""49636505""); list(name = ""Jovana Jakovljevic"", ids = ""4242409""); list(name = ""Ana Savic-Radojevic"", ids = ""1400473746""); list(name = ""Marija Pljesa-Ercegovac"", ids = ""1400474256""); list(name = ""Slavica RadovanoviÄ‡"", ids = ""5115679""); list(name = ""Dragan Simic"", ids = ""48479985""); list(name = ""Steva I Pljesa"", ids = ""6374752""); list(name = ""MiloÅ¡ Å½arkoviÄ‡"", ids = ""46569123""); list(name = ""Jasmina MimiÄ‡-Oka"", ids = ""1402348327""); list(name = ""Nada Dimkovic"", ids = ""49563772""); list(name = ""Tatjana Simic"", ids = ""48234818"")",0eb295951598fac02e7f9a522d15fdee174fd04e; 295acc4ac2b5212bd432d05b8dba28ac5cbc3968; c00ba6063733e3f1fd29f88d6b360882088afc9c; a7064d2d9ee5d16258872aaf6d41aa865a7b75fc,e87c76b246d365703bbfa484fc6fdaead49ed7a5; 864e61688879559bde7cce8d25de425196b1aa5f; 21a10b241364a16f56ecce9900cab17a7678b3f7; 368dcc4a21eef1bf636994cd8e28f7100b815da2; 66416323c55dd5c2e2623fe58f8803c2ba461f08; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 91546707320c54d46f2a7e90a34c6b6836baad64; cacd4fd12a3cad5384cc54570a4135a37fdb1fd2; 7518f651bc962ac7514aba43969e553908da3f6e; 372c691d59c829a3b6ba5f4361da7552b36d841a; f252725c7e4f042047babbb8024c7717b3260e5c; 205ecf609083c58f5f0387b1f8c1ac215cf34174; 51c27d918d64e3c16585c6eab1ae0be24ba4149b; 6da8d71c86b1e5ff028ce31570a4973a39337527; d5a2f9301d98b8bdd8664a5b411c9253fe8a27cc; 3fb225b957bf69afc71926f2e4afb8413459855e; 1758cffdb8bf7abad005f2c7eff0a1c0f637a832; 5f4f07dfdd022c98ed80e5fd530eb6b09f53b1fa; 3a741b8e2aa7476565e68aabeba767734a41fcb5; beb16ce49513b154fbd08aa9ea52c14c7a23ff09; b9c0c7e34cdb547082087362f616391855296429; ed9ba0ebac558ead9a8f7b96d0dc9caf4b320284; 20310ac197f5785ba80c2c91a274f68698397e7b; 8fecf93496cfb8a297e5b273afc956f4a52dfd25; bb340ee100f61d848b640fe1976366e199afd0e4; d128581c4f8c5c10cc9f91d04a7dedc99d9e73d1; 058e9c80bd9ed1f8d1003c45b7543f99aa554714; ece7a1cd4c493a19b8f7d5e5bc3310737ab786c4; cbf6174ebb3317fd3387164060c9f20cf433ba4d; 558c378dffa3d34bb7924fd4242c7836187bc429; 5d37d9e52f2fe9b5835967619e873a7090fc6ec2; c9d9b761b31ee00f098bdbd557f27c9b45a83fad; 7f40fcb2ce6f8ed441dd00b4e22f682a68e98d11; 715580a7be4c1945b2ab608bd43dd4f718587643; dcafe39d4b3befb805ad9db8f3c22eda9db79221; 4b11bf9d033f4fffced2a04dff6648214bac42b7; c8e9d703987a4fcdbabb6092cd4b7045fcb86f2f,BMC Nephrology,15,12 - 12
2312dd0393c6b929336d2871f028f2b3e19a5a54,Large-scale interpretation of chemical-genetic interaction profiles using a genetic interaction network,"Genetic interactions provide a key for interpreting the functional information contained in chemical-genetic interaction profiles. However, they have remained underutilized in this capacity across recent chemical-genetic interaction screening efforts and their ability to interpret chemical-genetic interaction profiles on a large scale has not been tested. We developed a method, which we refer to as CG-TARGET (Chemical Genetic Translation via A Reference Genetic nETwork), that integrates the data from large-scale chemical-genetic interaction screens with genetic interaction data to predict the biological processes perturbed by compounds. CG-TARGET compared favorably to a standard enrichment approach across a variety of benchmarks, achieving similar performance on measures of accuracy and substantial improvement in the ability to control the false discovery rate of its predictions. We found that one-third to one-half of gene mutants in the data contribute to the highest-confidence biological process predictions and that these contributions overwhelmingly come from negative chemical-genetic interactions. This method was used to prioritize over 1500 out of over 13,000 compounds for further study in a recently-completed chemical-genetic interaction screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, enabling the rapid functional annotation of unknown compounds to biological processes through targeted biological validations. We present here a detailed characterization of the method and further biological validations to demonstrate the utility of genetic interactions in the interpretation of chemical-genetic interaction profiles and the effectiveness of our implementation of this concept.",2017,Computer Science,"list(name = ""Scott W.

5e2366ebec6bacfc1263ac31dbf5d0f4fd924358,Detection of genomic regions underlying resistance to gastrointestinal parasites in Australian sheep,"BackgroundThis study aimed at identifying genomic regions that underlie genetic variation of worm egg count, as an indicator trait for parasite resistance in a large population of Australian sheep, which was genotyped with the high-density 600Â K Ovine single nucleotide polymorphism array. This study included 7539 sheep from different locations across Australia that underwent a field challenge with mixed gastrointestinal parasite species. Faecal samples were collected and worm egg counts for three strongyle species, i.e. Teladorsagia circumcincta, Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis were determined. Data were analysed using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and regional heritability mapping (RHM).ResultsBoth RHM and GWAS detected a region on Ovis aries (OAR) chromosome 2 that was highly significantly associated with parasite resistance at a genome-wise false discovery rate of 5%. RHM revealed additional significant regions on OAR6, 18, and 24. Pathway analysis revealed 13 genes within these significant regions (SH3RF1, HERC2, MAP3K, CYFIP1, PTPN1, BIN1, HERC3, HERC5, HERC6, IBSP, SPP1, ISG20, and DET1), which have various roles in innate and acquired immune response mechanisms, as well as cytokine signalling. Other genes involved in haemostasis regulation and mucosal defence were also detected, which are important for protection of sheep against invading parasites.ConclusionsThis study identified significant genomic regions on OAR2, 6, 18, and 24 that are associated with parasite resistance in sheep. RHM was more powerful in detecting regions that affect parasite resistance than GWAS. Our results support the hypothesis that parasite resistance is a complex trait and is determined by a large number of genes with small effects, rather than by a few major genes with large effects.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Mohammad Al Kalaldeh"", ids = ""147395756""); list(name = ""John P Gibson"", ids = ""145614893""); list(name = ""Sang Hong Lee"", ids = ""2874363""); list(name = ""Cedric Gondro"", ids = ""2092891""); list(name = ""Julius H.

eef90978b47b54aa7bcb25cd02548b525ce0043c,Enrichment of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer risk variants in colon expression quantitative trait loci,"BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diseases of the colon including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the functional role of many of these SNPs is largely unknown and tissue-specific resources are lacking. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping identifies target genes of disease-associated SNPs. This study provides a comprehensive eQTL map of distal colonic samples obtained from 40 healthy African Americans and demonstrates their relevance for GWAS of colonic diseases.Results8.4 million imputed SNPs were tested for their associations with 16,252 expression probes representing 12,363 unique genes. 1,941 significant cis-eQTL, corresponding to 122 independent signals, were identified at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01. Overall, among colon cis-eQTL, there was significant enrichment for GWAS variants for IBD (Crohnâ€™s disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) and CRC as well as type 2 diabetes and body mass index. ERAP2, ADCY3, INPP5E, UBA7, SFMBT1, NXPE1 and REXO2 were identified as target genes for IBD-associated variants. The CRC-associated eQTL rs3802842 was associated with the expression of C11orf93 (COLCA2). Enrichment of colon eQTL near transcription start sites and for active histone marks was demonstrated, and eQTL with high population differentiation were identified.ConclusionsThrough the comprehensive study of eQTL in the human colon, this study identified novel target genes for IBD- and CRC-associated genetic variants.

51026faff66d0e93474e9214afc461436b8c4bc0,Integrated analysis of microRNA expression and mRNA transcriptome in lungs of avian influenza virus infected broilers,"BackgroundAvian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks are worldwide threats to both poultry and humans. Our previous study suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in the regulation of host response to AIV infection in layer chickens. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis if genetic background play essential role in the miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and if miRNAs that were differentially expressed in layer with AIV infection would be modulated the same way in broiler chickens. Furthermore, by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiling, potential molecular mechanisms of host response to AIV infection can be further exploited.ResultsTotal RNA isolated from the lungs of non-infected and low pathogenic H5N3 infected broilers at four days post-infection were used for both miRNA deep sequencing and mRNA microarray analyses. A total of 2.6 M and 3.3 M filtered high quality reads were obtained from infected and non-infected chickens by Solexa GA-I Sequencer, respectively. A total of 271 miRNAs in miRBase 16.0 were identified and one potential novel miRNA was discovered. There were 121 miRNAs differentially expressed at the 5% false discovery rate by Fisherâ€™s exact test. More miRNAs were highly expressed in infected lungs (108) than in non-infected lungs (13), which was opposite to the findings in layer chickens. This result suggested that a different regulatory mechanism of host response to AIV infection mediated by miRNAs might exist in broiler chickens. Analysis using the chicken 44 K Agilent microarray indicated that 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed following AIV infection.ConclusionsA comprehensive analysis combining both miRNA and targeted mRNA gene expression suggests that gga-miR-34a, 122â€“1, 122â€“2, 146a, 155, 206, 1719, 1594, 1599 and 451, and MX1, IL-8, IRF-7, TNFRS19 are strong candidate miRNAs or genes involved in regulating the host response to AIV infection in the lungs of broiler chickens.

1c9988be491be3ceee87871f9b1ca4344a797d14,Identification of pathogenic genes and transcription factors in glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by alterations in the contour of the optic nerve head, with corresponding visual field defects and progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. The present study aimed to identify the key genes and upstream regulators in glaucoma. To screen the pathogenic genes involved in glaucoma, an integrated analysis was performed by using the microarray datasets in glaucoma derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The functional annotation and potential pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were additionally examined by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. A glaucomaâ€‘specific transcriptional regulatory network was constructed to identify crucial transcriptional factors that target the DEGs in glaucoma. From two GEO datasets, 1,935 DEGs (951 upregulated and 984 downregulated genes) between glaucoma and normal controls were identified. GO and KEGG analyses identified that 'eye development' [false discovery rate (FDR)=0.00415533] and 'visual perception' (FDR=0.00713283) were significantly enriched pathways for DEGs. The expression of lipocalin 2 (LCN2), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), hemoglobin subunit Î² (HBB), paired box 6 (PAX6), fibronectin (FN1) and cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) were demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In conclusion, LCN2, MAOA, HBB, PAX6, FN1 and CREB1 may serve roles in glaucoma, regulated by PAX4, solute carrier family 22 member 1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 Î± and ELK1, ETS transcription factor. These data may contribute to the development of novel potential biomarkers, reveal the underlying pathogenesis and additionally identify novel therapeutic targets for glaucoma.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jie Feng"", ids = ""145556737""); list(name = ""Jing Xu"", ids = ""51160666"")",8c4a15cf3ced843be0d931bde610d5d97d870589,,Molecular medicine reports,20 1,"

a1a44dca9fee0614778da86091ff3b6415248edc,Abnormal Brain Responses to Action Observation in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.,"Patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) display various abnormalities in central motor function, and their pain is intensified when they perform or just observe motor actions. In this study, we examined the abnormalities of brain responses to action observation in CRPS. We analyzed 3-T functional magnetic resonance images from 13 upper limb CRPS patients (all female, ages 31-58Â years) and 13 healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects. The functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired while the subjects viewed brief videos of hand actions shown in the first-person perspective. A pattern-classification analysis was applied to characterize brain areas where the activation pattern differed between CRPS patients and healthy subjects. Brain areas with statistically significant group differences (qÂ <Â .05, false discovery rate-corrected) included the hand representation area in the sensorimotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, secondary somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal lobule, orbitofrontal cortex, and thalamus. Our findings indicate that CRPS impairs action observation by affecting brain areas related to pain processing and motor control.


PERSPECTIVE
This article shows that in CRPS, the observation of others' motor actions induces abnormal neural activity in brain areas essential for sensorimotor functions and pain. These results build the cerebral basis for action-observation impairments in CRPS.",2017,Medicine,"list(name = ""Jaakko Hotta"", ids = ""5295524""); list(name = ""Jukka Saari"", ids = ""37578044""); list(name = ""Miika Koskinen"", ids = ""48331562""); list(name = ""Yevhen Hlushchuk"", ids = ""2384363""); list(name = ""Nina Forss"", ids = ""5604182""); list(name = ""Riitta Hari"", ids = ""143873866"")",aef80588b1323ac937ba6affb29c9c49de3b069d; 828066143461a7d6bcb089e9d9461402ba13865a; b4a626e8d8cef223132d8916c235c022e506ec0f; 145583a7c0e5592385ef9bb2c7cab7ea8f39351a; 7b048795cbf196e5c40eab4ce25106d1859c0aea,29c0ada71bd01e48e5d347db80c6b3eed65750b0; 14a5e312b5e683bcb84ceb80366d2009617afb89; 985cceaca8606443f9129616a26bbbbf952f2d7f; a1ff72f2663fc69bbef10af49e684a87bddbf4d5; 35a7ddfc40131d83ed2130df8fd29e993b4031b6; f71ba1070b6a278a21742af34b751b15b929ce82; cf93a3464609cfb697a32e1acd06206bab187f40; 02dbcbac35511cfc3f749c45157a50d2757c5bed; 4f98a4d5daa82fc17c44b5cfc5839689a6152acb; 5bb1cddfe7fc137be99859a5221ba6a37a7d1bbf; 5ee5d43b2053b9ba1387861a056e60beb3cec721; a1ef02e29747fc0141274934c97e47937e88aa8b; e7b85db89d5f2311b2e53dcac457cd8d27d20a83; 09f88907b681cf1846e9df51920858dc37ffe1ad; 0a3be0a4e264650fce1c64c330f109249cb3d364; 032e4cbd3c0628eb3245db6a6f3ccaf00acb4b84; 2094bfcda9b544223a2de9ea3f57dc643bcbd1ba; e99d38d3e9398890b081689306e770b69ccc869c; f5def76fcebb36c826e17e6f68a5b875c356451b; 03d61a33796234b8bae5ac38de9b26c1c5ed9e2f; da563bdd6616ec2b0aab9fa86b4b9cb39bb6eaaf; 9e6695eb07d664e5722ade04a169b96d2f15cefb; e7ad3a0a69ee6857eb6e08772182e12a17404ed6; eb1bb24c5c3c8f399e787cc31176dd83d0322f6c; 0a0c1b0a1ddb3ba29668923dcee0cfb7f6af2b58; 34c99704707ae85c34644b12f0bc68a3dde5a112; 832bc8a35af621937d66546f3dc2b47a2a31f650; c4565395a20a471d4233ddb4315e46f7df926bdf; 10b9bca982c1b904e079df4c6dd45c761d5eefd4; cff78c73d73db68821d0712aca44a7342a3e5e10; 44445803eb255772b8ba49e6c1d2fb7bc8001c2b; 77b23b1769c4ede19e47daeaec922add22ccac85; 7112ee75d2a4dadce328595fbc9f1f59e81c2fa2; 73f909bae5802e9a82cc6111bed9ca2348f955cf; 6cfa9672baff3304194af8673fdbb70d354a93fe; b8ce206bd39ee53b22afe012867c74db1b63bf46; 8d1c588d202f150e1797ed113fba7e67bfa43ecb; 46a4a0cdf58d79fc3143efbe7034442ae69b3be0; b4ace41dc48654d35a7b41618a695bc9109fb306; 5d085b00b894f77286fd1ec1580f97bdb9b71b40; ba38045e9f01ec4d128c5fbe5a46dc209fccaac4; 82b3397059f790473147fe5ab664a9424eb69ce3; 9324e23408bbbcbbbbbc3ab7b28e70439e4bc253; d09ac5d1f10ca8e3eb4a681dacdc358e05b831e9; fe54252ff9043d9e9f05b02a776f4d6940212f9e; e595302c3418370b9ef978f38c7d5b2d5111444e; a9e319ddb46025e3fd3b4ee9d6ea2dc0570f266d; ec1b554f342ec081e12e75cd8504690887b49668; 782fcd0d5afbf68481772c4a457ef0d60b75b97a; 4a7b8fb8cb69f53c6c2ac3ae518a974773240b94; 09f3944381fba1a98d304cf3f327f1a1e755a5c0; 16e4fd57205a87e6f0ec64a138bbb7b5cb2785b4; 154e967b29980cb3f93ddc6f9faa29c511bc003a; 6940fc8e49d249179d391b258768f11e74038b17; f3106c0eafb767ad41c5863210c7608617b598f2; 7e9ca0b74a5567ad5aed5b53b578ed48ce12aa43; d3ac9f4888ed18910cd79d630921db1e5f171653; a0c2814adc434d25fbb445be73e60f8933256344; 6caf3f7ca0c78d1863bf7d17656ee164f1c6f465; c587c37d3857555cf19aff9c6b20e09295fc15b9; bdd27a2a97356a1e7eb48b6ebae20ec0f94e9f0b; c2bc880156c10fc8d1752cd3d528e4ef96cbaac4; a5ae7741274ddd88eec4b609a5034a11e73bde35; 9cc5366c2ab2163f5d0a5aceaaef641cbe341fe8; 730f79cf524251060be7bdc5d9586393b2c76581; 3fd2ae96c87a3eadd8816de2d4bba230a9fba6c0; 767b71902de229ab0bc12f417c01bfbb35283b65,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,18 3,"

25e445c02ed5a01ff8265a4190a561bed2b0a2c5,Circulating Progenitor Cells: a Novel Biomarker of Microvascular and Macrovascular Disease in Type 2 Diabetic Patients,"Objective. We evaluated the ability of circulating stem cell levels to predict future micro and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. We further investigate the prognostic value of stem cells in a wide and heterogeneous cohort of patients, using a meta-analytic approach. 
Research design and methods. A cohort of 187 patients with type 2 diabetes was followed-up for a median of 3.3 years and 6.1 years for the evaluation of microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, respectively. The primary outcomes were onset or progression of any microangiopathy, and time to a first cardiovascular event. In addition, we meta-analysed all studies reporting the prognostic role of the CPC/EPC measure on cardiovascular outcomes and death in a heterogeneous population of 4451 patients at high cardiovascular risk. 
Results. New onset or progression of microangiopathy occurred in 70 patients (9.5% per year). After controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), baseline CD34+ CPCs and EPCs were significantly lower in patients with onset/progression of microalbuminuria and any microangiopathy. Patients with baseline CD34+ CPC or CD133+KDR+ EPC levels below median were more likely to experience worsening microangiopathy than those with high cell levels. In FDR-fully-adjusted analysis, CD34+ cells predicted onset/progression of microalbuminuria, retinopathy, and any microangiopathy. A first cardiovascular event occurred in 48 patients (4.5% per year). Patients with incident cardiovascular events had significantly lower CD34+ and CD34+CD133+ cells than those without. Patients with below median levels of CD34+ and CD34+CD133+ cells experienced higher rates of cardiovascular events. In Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, a reduced CD34+ and CD34+CD133+ cell count independently predicted future events. Addition of the CD34+ cell count to the UKPDS risk engine model improved C-statistics, continuous NRI and/or IDI. In the meta-analysis, reduced CPC/EPC levels were associated with a ~2 fold increased risk of future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death and the most predictive phenotypes were CD34+ and CD34+CD133+. 
Conclusions. In patients with type 2 diabetes, a reduced baseline level of circulating CD34+ stem cells predicts worsening of microangiopathy and cardiovascular events up to 6 years later, and improves risk stratification. The meta-analysis suggests that prognostic impact of reduced stem cell levels was similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Mauro Rigato"", ids = ""4694351"")",,d5ddc0c24c34d62cf7eeca2e53ee51a63e6ea2c9; 44902feac274ddeaa294aca1c853a93243443208; 6ea448da56b1047fb414f9c3f4a296f21eabf650; a89247dcde559e5839cef19b130059e2ad9abc75; 161480e8f47aa936dfe65df605604c4e38479789; d89691d4215516c291ea661ee7c92527ca085911; 97fa3174a52063f7aa8730d94b29a7159f87a7b0; d850ddd709d11b17dc23e05ac32eaa33f0eee6bc; 2f384dad414d54281d29e7912cbcdb2b17dde90c; eb385189a61eec65426ea80a2ec5d8604e11a819; d57cf7a0a6d59f7c2fb12a3049ac633a56b6ff7c; bd0f8e1cd251118c6175e2f71f5c559a2884b8bc; 4d9f9cf61d1e3548a726e8381c90969851579843; c1975f2469937fc29f3881d92f7e5496e76dbaf2; 06b8ada463a104385b1259403218e84952824c5d; 12b4ed2e71ce60ffb63c3a9585ddf6b0eedb4c4b; cda139a21980938875bbdcca4282f7efc03cfe0d; b8aac20a63dcce68740662c09dcfafb3b4f7cab2; 89a1bfb7f49a04217f78d080cb59e292aba02915; fd441e979a4c36f242d63f1e8a70cfbbe226e38f; 8fd1c82ea97f020b06761cf53ef18a38ac5baa7b; 71935b738670306f4e670cffc0901fd20a9ebe09; 788a260e9151541d26f3b050ba111ba7157f55d3; 2d4ef34a72c5982ce9b5fd599eb760147a6e450c; 55ef6232c998f5c4f92519e9ea441ab7ca93b4d5; 523c5abd4cd798a3ae4b0df7463d6fe8dad551ed; cd58131a0ff08471ac351818767c56d9a3c404f6; 76183d0b87581de9a9b9e91b146dbfae880c9d0c; 4f472508f98dc4326c5bb5b6da3af4178b0d36ff; 555c5ab9c7f6f48b11618fcdf105c265b894fb19; 30ecf3cca42ffea6009550810e7fada5a94e5233; f164680944f8bbf64e5fb8de2eb64ed06c971da7; 1323dafd003b7cda5a94af497393228155f03790; 2ac2c387a3ddd5dc202de7507be29fc4896bd068; 511f5b243f83b84a37078833c8ebfc143bb75ecc; 19296b0b2b31997a33f3114efe2e626c76277c46; 327a55558601738c9a2dab66410dcb5aebd8a628; ebe8b8e286fad37b9eb0b68ab9684b28fa38fde2; 7a157110341402f88ad3cc7c9df450be4adb894a; 068575da0f0042fd6fe95a974f55b8285573962c; 0c193054d7a9a67c13e5b75b80da99cc4c5aca81; bb7ecc0282929c8c33219c5619c90de54bd688b5; d57b0a20d1bb618bf430b1407686a0fb890f6272; b5d2ff3766182c71c1119cbc06c05bcf55b66d43; 897fe105ff01f15e9f5d2a0cee97709c01f6c68d; af5ddd993c967e29108040e6c7b036fdc0fb228a; 96e056a3b126555c728d3075f4fa5c788f29ca2f; 837ff533f1ba620efd359e32671898021908d8c3; 4ed64f6abc972ba3e3e186b05a495025f50c3c4d; 95498609f26deeace2717f3eca3fff73abc957c5; d47698af3a3beb5fa845e791c6113e0c6d669d5a; 2f3fa09a6406e30a1b42aa8f7b8848a0f3700202; 280919426838baf65923da53ee15004a6ebc89c6; 12fdd1e43052ff1adc284c3f52297639ac493743; 4c6687e3980f009b13f617f867cafc2a663e2490; b97fcc46f6adfd047aeded44738b570ce795d943; 5ad129d93ffb3188625ce70f13b024d6dc10e0c4; a11d43e8a45f4220fc52795768a012ebbbb5264a; 0ffefa90a80526a23f37d886de4fb8b68e74e71b; 009fe3bc32a5d827d032d082ab7d502cc4a1c0cf; f37deb26eedf83fc2a12a713750efe210e23b4d3; 3c346881439f5b2ff254509b04cff7b03b8a7e15; 61be351fa50f3260d5b1e6ce26b4753be10d4744; e3350cbb70135624748010ea5c6bd04475c5b7af; d863756719d76a56647609a32c273e5a42b1e560; 7c74734432b8c1842673da3af4dbbc2bbbc766b4; 0135a12bf317ccf503eb58bcb2999cfd8b369fb3; 8fe0d520c100f956d70e9c5ccd993795c15d3441; 6099bde7799d89870ba03e4919269c0bd6677b33; a2a386c8d2260a0702576e3f980c58f5e39b4ed5; c88035c7ea7e1049c8c075332ca2a3b3db1c0645; d0420755bebfd709fe8200e4b3932117c4b96763; f8fefb6c6a9fe822afaf34cc78fd87fa9ad66426; b1ac9de575bdb519f09b3660be8fb411785be3b3; 465928334c99a3e91cc6c990aa1f8b7cde8c097f; d3eb19a268d69d98ab0f3835f4f864b9747cc703; 45a13ba1ea0f8da2adbfafe7cbd170e87e45be05; ffda9d663514de1bf79aab361e86f301694d3a80; ccecec7625dc191103fe0b702beaf69591d86026; 984adcee36380063eb6510bc2837a85f579e4a72; dfb57fad4249c7d5016e64a58e14b71bb51e2928; d48c8de2b0dafe1e07710508c38d64b148657341; e8070a1f5665a7c742b184963aac0d635d14b62f; 6456c46effa681d5fa058a4da2dcecb5a9ae70e0; 59ba5cb0405d1556c3c8f660cb6560b40e6f96a1; 9d340c67b50a507111c9f4a9d14996c24d5d8a9a; e1b99894487b9ab8b7d3d4a1a19b63f9a7c187a0; 96f19980a61708b966196017d57fdc2abffb7648; 660168dbe48731c1dae7dfd14a0525404d8e59e5; 878b04381ad0316baa4fd212bee769f00167434a; c888c33e3074abfede522aaa3a6efee1fdff2f65; e876e9d891ef33212e312ec4def38564007d0ee3; 943ce4e82a8b8e341fc4d49999a6a2a6684c82c2; 1e873ac7a356d4377817c768296852b16fb5c8a1; 5e29e36662156b52488392c12459e88fec3f4d9b; fabfc9074ba02a91027b0565faec187a9389e165; a434fcd8be82cb1f72189f6725f9a751342d0e94; 436feaef53bacbab52fe566db8992fb6e2663fe6,,,
b582bbbd4b5a9f617a67ce2ab6d0201d620e3012,Clinical and genetic factors associated with nausea and vomiting in cancer patients receiving opioids.,"BACKGROUND
This study investigates whether demographical, disease-related and genetic factors contribute to inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among patients receiving opioids for cancer pain.


METHODS
Cancer patients receiving opioids were included from 17 centres in 11 European countries. Intensities of nausea and vomiting were reported by 1579 patients on four-point categorical scales. In stratified regression models including demographical and disease-related factors as covariates, 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 candidate genes related to opioid- or nausea/vomiting signalling pathways (ABCB1, OPRM1, OPRK1, ARRB2, STAT6, COMT, CHRM3, CHRM5, HRH1, DRD2, DRD3, TACR1, HTR3A, HTR3B, HTR3C, CNR1) were analysed for association with nausea and vomiting.


FINDINGS
Age, body mass index, Karnofsky Performance Status, gender, use of antiemetics, type of opioid, type of cancer and eight SNPs were associated with the inter-individual differences in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients treated with opioids (p<0.01). The SNPs were rs1176744, rs3782025 and rs1672717 in HTR3B; rs165722, rs4680 and rs4633 in COMT; rs10802789 and rs685550 in CHRM3. Only the SNP rs1672717 in HTR3B passed the Benjamini-Hochberg criterion for a 10% false discovery rate.


INTERPRETATION
Clinical characteristics and SNPs within the HTR3B, COMT and CHRM3 genes may be associated with the variability in nausea and vomiting among cancer patients receiving opioids. This knowledge may help to identify patients at particular risk for nausea and vomiting during treatment with opioids for cancer pain.",2011,Medicine,"list(name = ""Eivor Alette Laugsand"", ids = ""6921915""); list(name = ""Torill Fladvad"", ids = ""6541719""); list(name = ""Frank Skorpen"", ids = ""6813653""); list(name = ""Marco Maltoni"", ids = ""3552692""); list(name = ""Stein Kaasa"", ids = ""2373918""); list(name = ""Peter M.

e570728b6966e4e1c143da60e8256f13e948d4e7,The Power of the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure,"Background: The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is a popular method for controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in multiple testing experiments. Currently available software for sample size calculation in the FDR context is based on asymptotic behavior of the BH procedure, assuming independent test statistics and possibly a common effect size. In this study, we investigate how this asymptotic behavior, in terms of the proportion of rejected hypotheses and average power, relates to performance of the BH procedure when these assumptions are not met. Furthermore, we decompose the asymptotic expression for the average power, and propose a number of alternative choices for its components, including the possiblity of controlling the False Discovery Proportion (FDP) exceedance probability rather than the FDR. Results: We performed a number of simulation experiments to assess the effects of the number of tested hypotheses, sample size, basic dependence, and presence of an effect size distribution, on the performance of the BH procedure. Our results show that testing fewer hypotheses is associated with an increase in the variance of the power distribution. A conservative power estimator based on the law of the iterated logarithm can ensure a high probability of the power exceeding the desired level, and automatically scales with the number of tested hypotheses. We find this bound remains effective even under low to moderate equicorrelation (Ï â‰¤ 0.5), or if only the true null hypotheses are correlated. In the presence of an effect size distribution, sample sizes calculated assuming a common effect size are under-estimated for higher power levels, and over-estimated for lower power levels. Conclusions: Sample size calculations based on the asymptotic average power are quite robust to violations of the assumptions of infinite and independent tests. Related, but more conservative estimators, allow a researcher to ensure a high probability of exceeding a desired power level and/or make confidence statements about the FDP in the rejection set. Basing sample size calculations on the assumption of a common effect size should be carefully considered, however, since depending on the shape of the effect size distribution and desired power level, the resulting sample size estimates may not lead to adequate power.

The current study aimed at delineating and cross-validating brain volumetric surrogates of sex and gender by comparing the structural magnetic resonance imaging data of cis- and transgender subjects using multivariate pattern analysis. Gray matter (GM) tissue maps of 29 transgender men, 23 transgender women, 35 cisgender women, and 34 cisgender men were created using voxel-based morphometry and analyzed using support vector classification. Generalizability of the models was estimated using repeated nested cross-validation. For external validation, significant models were applied to hormone-treated transgender subjects (nâ€‰=â€‰32) and individuals diagnosed with depression (nâ€‰=â€‰27). Sex was identified with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 82.6% (false discovery rate [pFDR] <â€‰0.001) in cisgender, but only with 67.5% (pFDRâ€‰=â€‰0.04) in transgender participants indicating differences in the neuroanatomical patterns associated with sex in transgender despite the major effect of sex on GM volume irrespective of the self-identification as a woman or man. Gender identity and gender incongruence could not be reliably identified (all pFDRâ€‰>â€‰0.05). The neuroanatomical signature of sex in cisgender did not interact with depressive features (BACâ€‰=â€‰74.7%) but was affected by hormone therapy when applied in transgender women (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).",2019,Medicine; Psychology,"list(name = ""Pia Baldinger-Melich"", ids = ""1403679102""); list(name = ""Maria F Urquijo Castro"", ids = ""151395679""); list(name = ""Rene Seiger"", ids = ""2283356""); list(name = ""Anne Dominique Ruef"", ids = ""32098768""); list(name = ""Dominic B.

bcb1f20b5a52cb340945d7e58526a3a23646046b,Automated selection of r for the r largest order statistics approach with adjustment for sequential testing,"The r largest order statistics approach is widely used in extreme value analysis because it may use more information from the data than just the block maxima. In practice, the choice of r is critical. If r is too large, bias can occur; if too small, the variance of the estimator can be high. The limiting distribution of the r largest order statistics, denoted by GEV$$_r$$r, extends that of the block maxima. Two specification tests are proposed to select r sequentially. The first is a score test for the GEV$$_r$$r distribution. Due to the special characteristics of the GEV$$_r$$r distribution, the classical chi-square asymptotics cannot be used. The simplest approach is to use the parametric bootstrap, which is straightforward to implement but computationally expensive. An alternative fast weighted bootstrap or multiplier procedure is developed for computational efficiency. The second test uses the difference in estimated entropy between the GEV$$_r$$r and GEV$$_{r-1}$$r-1 models, applied to the r largest order statistics and the $$r-1$$r-1 largest order statistics, respectively. The asymptotic distribution of the difference statistic is derived. In a large scale simulation study, both tests held their size and had substantial power to detect various misspecification schemes. A new approach to address the issue of multiple, sequential hypotheses testing is adapted to this setting to control the false discovery rate or familywise error rate. The utility of the procedures is demonstrated with extreme sea level and precipitation data.",2017,Mathematics; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Brian Bader"", ids = ""50739618""); list(name = ""Jun Yan"", ids = ""49781448""); list(name = ""Xuebin Zhang"", ids = ""3133825"")",d80580f6dcbead06cf82abb2c6ec88399f85921b; 99c0be896bb4b6efec1820a5647d155dbe5dc01d; 8f3404465a043309537ef61d312dde6400a2d125; c294eb944422c61d3c8788ac11ee000593e1897f,ca3f9cd2edd064ea57758e6989660fc19995e5db; 2cacce5d0e1fd084d43de4ac9d6cacf52942fd2a; d2e92453696a514c913bab8e98fcc14ea2ea97ea; e03fcae87b049671f979106c215bd985475e3f7e; 8608d2c8ac6c785f74cc03be533cb6ff0b7ebce1; 156e7730b8ba8a08ec97eb6c2eaaf2124ed0ce6e; f1eb9a41d8041da263c050f89e246f7c3fb37d95; 7f7436ccbdd62408b4f958408f99c47a50ab80f7; 2d8bc065924c4729e15b565eca0e7b06a8077b2c; 59ac99583c8c5ec9de91932ce2397baf81e84f4d; 7c1b39c098820ae6d1004250fa61f55623c57fab; 2fb5f8ec6ac6a8ef4bcf6f6add2526a769eee3a2; 76c8acda981a3d691d72d8d33c97c6f947c1cbe4; 21c7c53b1bd45f842fb06a5fa3943dc9619a86cd; 2b37e1d4e3268ac59fe212186b7074337b5e1bbf; 411aab368cc191564a38b764d29aa9d37b852cdc; 3675128551cc7c6aba102b0c8d66aa390e201030; cbb8b7c2278fbb992d34af1fa1c5ca751d8499e6; fe82878c37015d8b74da292ea946094b47ab97a3; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 905e264286c1b05a1f802659bb075a7cd5274492; d46ce3c131ce238cc6d473233f75db9653e0dc3e; 347ea6ce4ef973984b258ab13f47317291e59f4e; 5103a817b89851d1ac0242c55a7840b4d56c9cdf; f2ab1962bb166df245904e8fd03eac99ba471bc0; f95004eb131844ae0b2fcc439f6573188309683e; e9eda07d055c5a1bde88f3aef700fd201fc0be2f,Statistics and Computing,27,1435-1451
7cd7180d652586140d1df7106b6ebf8c8ea60d75,Feature selection and classification methodology for the detection of knee-joint disorders,"Vibroarthographic (VAG) signals emitted from the knee joint disorder provides an early diagnostic tool. The nonstationary and nonlinear nature of VAG signal makes an important aspect for feature extraction. In this work, we investigate VAG signals by proposing a wavelet based decomposition. The VAG signals are decomposed into sub-band signals of different frequencies. Nonlinear features such as recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) are extracted as features of VAG signal. A total of twenty-four features form a vector to characterize a VAG signal. Two feature selection (FS) techniques, apriori algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) selects six and four features as the most significant features. Least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) and random forest are proposed as classifiers to evaluate the performance of FS techniques. Results indicate that the classification accuracy was more prominent with features selected from FS algorithms. Results convey that LS-SVM using the apriori algorithm gives the highest accuracy of 94.31% with false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.0892. The proposed work also provided better classification accuracy than those reported in the previous studies which gave an accuracy of 88%. This work can enhance the performance of existing technology for accurately distinguishing normal and abnormal VAG signals.

58ea96f4afa116d1cda66fd1fce0b06e738ff483,Abstract P4-05-04: Proteomic patterns unravel a new luminal-A breast cancer molecular subgroup with prognostic value,"Background: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease including a variety of entities with different genetic background. Estrogen receptor-positive, HER2 negative tumors (ER+) usually have a favorable outcome, although some patients eventually relapse, which suggests some heterogeneity within this category. In the last years, proteomic approaches have been incorporated to the study of clinical samples as a way to complement the information provided by gene analysis. Shotgun proteomics allows measuring over 1,000 proteins in clinical samples. In the present study, we combined genomic and proteomic techniques to characterize a set of breast tumors. Methods: The study population consisted of 102 patients with lymph-node positive breast cancer who had received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Protein extracts from FFPE samples were prepared in 2% SDS buffer and digested with trypsin. SDS was removed from digested lysates, and resulting peptides were analyzed in an Orbitrap Velos. Protein abundance was calculated on the basis of the normalized spectral protein intensity (LFQ intensity) using MaxQuant. A prognostic protein signature was built. Findings were verified using whole genome gene expression data from 1,141 patients included in public repositories. To this purpose, the protein signature was converted to a gene signature. Data analysis was done using MeV, BRBArray Tools, R and Cytoscape software suites and Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/) and DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) webtools. Results: We identified 3,000 protein groups in FFPE breast cancer samples and selected 1,000 that were identified at least in 75% of the samples. Significance Analysis for Microarrays analysis revealed 224 protein groups differentially expressed between ER+ and triple-negative (TN) samples (False Discovery Rate set at Conclusions: Proteomic profiling showed that cellular adhesion is a differential process between ER+ and TN breast cancer, and is reduced in the TN tumors. A group of ER+ breast tumors with reduced cellular adhesion was identified (TN-like). Patients with this luminal-A, TN-like breast cancer type had a poor outcome. This prognostic information was complementary to that offered by genomic tests such as OncoType.

80389daa307d53b5d6bf7a13c25deba21b5a9b39,Finding co-mutated genes and candidate cancer genes in cancer genomes by stratified false discovery rate control.,"Finding candidate cancer genes playing causal roles in carcinogenesis is an important task in cancer research. The non-randomness of the co-mutation of genes in cancer samples can provide statistical evidence for these genes' involvement in carcinogenesis. It can also provide important information on the functional cooperation of gene mutations in cancer. However, due to the relatively small sample sizes used in current high-throughput somatic mutation screening studies and the extraordinary large-scale hypothesis tests, the statistical power of finding co-mutated gene pairs based on high-throughput somatic mutation data of cancer genomes is very low. Thus, we proposed a stratified FDR (False Discovery Rate) control approach, for identifying significantly co-mutated gene pairs according to the mutation frequency of genes. We then compared the identified co-mutated gene pairs separately by pre-selecting genes with higher mutation frequencies and by the stratified FDR control approach. Finally, we searched for pairs of pathways annotated with significantly more between-pathway co-mutated gene pairs to evaluate the functional roles of the identified co-mutated gene pairs. Based on two datasets of somatic mutations in cancer genomes, we demonstrated that, at a given FDR level, the power of finding co-mutated gene pairs could be increased by pre-selecting genes with higher mutation frequencies. However, many true co-mutation between genes with lower mutation rates will still be missed. By the stratified FDR control approach, many more co-mutated gene pairs could be found. Finally, the identified pathway pairs significantly overrepresented with between-pathway co-mutated gene pairs suggested that their co-dysregulations may play causal roles in carcinogenesis. The stratified FDR control strategy is efficient in identifying co-mutated gene pairs and the genes in the identified co-mutated gene pairs can be considered as candidate cancer genes because their non-random co-mutations in cancer genomes are highly unlikely to be attributable to chance.",2011,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jing Wang"", ids = ""49606385""); list(name = ""Yang Zhang"", ids = ""46868248""); list(name = ""Xiaopei Shen"", ids = ""35116448""); list(name = ""Jing Zhu"", ids = ""47054967""); list(name = ""Lin Zhang"", ids = ""47059186""); list(name = ""Jinfeng Zou"", ids = ""2755311""); list(name = ""Zheng Guo"", ids = ""144663071"")",d42150f2ae430a8dc83788851eb5b09a13081070; f7b3db2f37b94657d44e22d7e492a2e5d2b084cf; db062565499707d5ab22b7dc7126f4adbfcde6e2; 9f397ea67b8995583312f33dc78bdcc7ce649a19; 07aff598baae211746d2335bdea89bde1fdcc7d5; c49a7e99220fc4ae05203bd00479350da93872b6; 269557d0a7da1d973a57b8874a0491532b302714,,Molecular bioSystems,7 4,"

It is not known whether brain signals associated with reward anticipation relate to psychopathology dimensions of depression or schizophrenia in childhood prior to adolescence. Method We examined whether fMRI brain correlates of reward anticipation related to psychotic-like experiences and symptoms of depression, in 2129 children from the ABCD study aged 9-10 years.Psychotic-like experiences and depression were assessed using the Prodromal Questionnaire Brief Child version and the K-SADS. We fused regional MRI summary statistics for reward anticipation activation in the ABCD study data release 1.0 (contrast of expected large reward versus neutral expectation). Relations between brain activation and psychopathology were assessed using linear regressions in R for 82 brain regions, corrected for multiple comparisons for the number of regions using false discovery rate. Results From several regressions, there was an isolated unilateral association between right parsorbitalis activation and psychotic-like experiences, but no other significant associations between brain activation and psychopathology. Conclusions In 9-10 year old children, reward anticipation is not strongly related to psychotic-like experiences or depression. As previous evidence links depression and schizophrenia to reduced reward anticipation in adults and older adolescents, it appears likely that such associations develop over the adolescent period: this can be tested in follow-up studies of the ABCD cohort.",2018,Biology,"list(name = ""Lisa Ronan"", ids = ""143610046""); list(name = ""Graham K.

35f99ba83ed1d6fe046e2bd650d0bebb0390e9bb,Estimation of a significance threshold for genome-wide association studies,"BackgroundSelection of an appropriate statistical significance threshold in genome-wide association studies is critical to differentiate true positives from false positives and false negatives. Different multiple testing comparison methods have been developed to determine the significance threshold; however, these methods may be overly conservative and may lead to an increase in false negatives. Here, we developed an empirical formula to determine the statistical significance threshold that is based on the marker-based heritability of the trait. To develop a formula for a significance threshold, we used 45 simulated traits in soybean, maize, and rice that varied in both broad sense heritability and the number of QTLs.ResultsA formula to determine a significance threshold was developed based on a regression equation that used one independent variable, marker-based heritability, and one response variable, âˆ’ log10 (P)-values. For all species, the threshold â€“log10 (P)-values increased as both marker-based and broad-sense heritability increased. Higher broad sense heritability in these crops resulted in higher significant threshold values. Among crop species, maize, with a lower linkage disequilibrium pattern, had higher significant threshold values as compared to soybean and rice.ConclusionsOur formula was less conservative and identified more true positive associations than the false discovery rate and Bonferroni correction methods.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Avjinder S.

7fcd7c844c4e11d8ccc4d55e22f922b51a74d0f4,NeuralFDR: Learning Discovery Thresholds from Hypothesis Features,"As datasets grow richer, an important challenge is to leverage the full features in the data to maximize the number of useful discoveries while controlling for false positives. We address this problem in the context of multiple hypotheses testing, where for each hypothesis, we observe a p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. For example, in genetic association studies, each hypothesis tests the correlation between a variant and the trait. We have a rich set of features for each variant (e.g. its location, conservation, epigenetics etc.) which could inform how likely the variant is to have a true association. However popular testing approaches, such as Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure (BH) and independent hypothesis weighting (IHW), either ignore these features or assume that the features are categorical or uni-variate. We propose a new algorithm, NeuralFDR, which automatically learns a discovery threshold as a function of all the hypothesis features. We parametrize the discovery threshold as a neural network, which enables flexible handling of multi-dimensional discrete and continuous features as well as efficient end-to-end optimization. We prove that NeuralFDR has strong false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees, and show that it makes substantially more discoveries in synthetic and real datasets.

f09ef9ac94f432cb30738e301fcfd6c93f83754b,Improving the power to detect differentially expressed genes in comparative microarray experiments by including information from self-self hybridizations,"Our ability to detect differentially expressed genes in a microarray experiment can be hampered when the number of biological samples of interest is limited. In this situation, we propose the use of information from self-self hybridizations to acuminate our inference of differential expression. A unified modelling strategy is developed to allow better estimation of the error variance. This principle is similar to the use of a pooled variance estimate in the two-sample t-test. The results from real dataset examples suggest that we can detect more genes that are differentially expressed in the combined models. Our simulation study provides evidence that this method increases sensitivity compared to using the information from comparative hybridizations alone, given the same control for false discovery rate. The largest increase in sensitivity occurs when the amount of information in the comparative hybridization is limited.",2007,Computer Science; Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Arief Gusnanto"", ids = ""3345179""); list(name = ""Brian Tom"", ids = ""40365095""); list(name = ""Philippa Burns"", ids = ""40208727""); list(name = ""Iain Macaulay"", ids = ""2625105""); list(name = ""Daphne C.

Specifically, T. gondii destroy the quality of sperm in the epididymis, which affects their sexual ability. However, among such studies, none have investigated the male reproductive transcriptome. Therefore, to investigate the relationship between T. gondii and sperm maturation, we infected mice with T. gondii prugniaud (PRU) strain and performed transcriptome sequencing of the epididymis.ResultsCompared with the control group, 431 upregulated and 229 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found (P-valueÂ <Â 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR)Â <Â 0.05 and |log2 (fold change)|Â â‰¥Â 1). According to results of a bioinformatics analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) function is divided into three categories: cellular component, molecular function and biological process. Upon performing GO analysis, we found that some DEGs correlated with an integral part of membrane, protein complex, cell surface, ATP binding, immune system process, signal transduction and metabolic process which are responsible for the epididymal injury. DEGs were mapped to 101 unique KEGG pathways. Pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and apoptosis are closely related to sperm quality. Moreover, Tnfsf10 and spata18 can damage the mitochondria in sperm, which decreases sperm motility and morphology.ConclusionsWe sequenced the reproductive system of male mice chronically infected with T. gondii, which provides a new direction for research into male sterility caused by Toxoplasma infection. This work provides valuable information and a comprehensive database for future studies of the interaction between T. gondii infection and the male reproductive system.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Y.

7d7a7e24f65aa8a8368ac79fad1625342edc2b79,Differential Expression of Inflammation-Related Genes in Children with Down Syndrome,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to investigate the expression patterns of a specific set of genes involved in the inflammation process in children with Down Syndrome (DS) and children without the syndrome (control group) to identify differences that may be related to the immune abnormalities observed in DS individuals.


METHOD
RNA samples were obtained from peripheral blood, and gene expression was quantified using the TaqManÂ® Array Plate Human Inflammation Kit, which facilitated the investigation into 92 inflammation-related genes and four reference genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).


RESULTS
Twenty genes showed differential expression in children with DS; 12 were overexpressed (PLA2G2D, CACNA1D, ALOX12, VCAM1, ICAM1, PLCD1, ADRB1, HTR3A, PDE4C, CASP1, PLA2G5, and PLCB4), and eight were underexpressed (LTA4H, BDKRB1, ADRB2, CD40LG, ITGAM, TNFRSF1B, ITGB1, and TBXAS1). After statistically correcting for the false discovery rate, only the genes BDKRB1 and LTA4H showed differential expression, and both were underexpressed within the DS group.


CONCLUSION
DS children showed differential expression of inflammation-related genes that were not located on chromosome 21 compared with children without DS. The BDKRB1 and LTA4H genes may differentiate the case and control groups based on the inflammatory response, which plays an important role in DS pathogenesis.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""ClÃ¡udia Regina dos Santos Silva"", ids = ""143680349""); list(name = ""Joice Matos Biselli-PÃ©rico"", ids = ""1421840681""); list(name = ""Bruna Lancia Zampieri"", ids = ""5564983""); list(name = ""Wilson AraÃºjo Silva"", ids = ""145707182""); list(name = ""Jorge Estefano Santana de Souza"", ids = ""145974881""); list(name = ""Matheus C.

bb525227dd422e286407e954ff60d3315080eedf,Transcriptional associations of osteoarthritis-mediated loss of epigenetic control in articular cartilage.,"OBJECTIVE
To identify osteoarthritis (OA) progression-modulating pathways in articular cartilage and their respective regulatory epigenetic and genetic determinants in end-stage disease.


METHODS
Transcriptional activity of CpG was assessed using gene expression data and DNA methylation data for preserved and lesional articular cartilage samples. Disease-responsive transcriptionally active CpG were identified by means of differential methylation between preserved and lesional cartilage. Transcriptionally relevant genetic determinants were addressed by means of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) proximal to the OA-responsive transcriptionally active CpG. Statistical analyses were corrected for age, sex, joint, and technical covariates. A random effect was included to correct for possible correlations between paired samples.


RESULTS
Of 9,838 transcribed genes in articular cartilage, 2,324 correlated with the methylation status of 3,748 transcriptionally active CpG; both negative (nâ€‰=â€‰1,741) and positive (nâ€‰=â€‰2,007) correlations were observed. Hypomethylation and hypermethylation (false discovery rate of <0.05, |Î”Î²|â€‰> 0.05) were observed for 62 and 25 transcriptionally active CpG, respectively, covering 70 unique genes. Enrichment for developmental and extracellular matrix maintenance pathways indicated possible reactivation of endochondral ossification. Finally, we observed 31 and 26 genes for which methylation and expression, respectively, were additionally affected by genetic variation.


CONCLUSION
We identified tissue-specific genes involved in OA disease progression, reflected by genetic and pathologic epigenetic regulation of transcription, primarily at genes involved in development. Therefore, transcriptionally active SNPs near these genes may serve as putative susceptibility alleles.

Because of the complexity of RNA-seq experiments, however, the field currently lacks a sample size method widely applicable to differential expression studies utilising RNA-seq technology. In this report, we propose several methods for sample size calculation for single-gene differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data under Poisson distribution. These methods are then extended to multiple genes, with consideration for addressing the multiple testing problem by controlling false discovery rate. Moreover, most of the proposed methods allow for closed-form sample size formulas with specification of the desired minimum fold change and minimum average read count, and thus are not computationally intensive. Simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed sample size formulas are presented; the results indicate that our methods work well, with achievement of desired power. Finally, our sample size calculation methods are applied to three real RNA-seq data sets.",2013,Mathematics; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Chung-I Li"", ids = ""3420603""); list(name = ""Pei-Fang Su"", ids = ""2071553""); list(name = ""Yan Guo"", ids = ""46791107""); list(name = ""Shyr Yu"", ids = ""144112918"")",330e6db61265c6cd0772040e551d9b0c53cd4574; 86435799b52242a34783c947edf33baa50407b7c; e6a5e8a0fdefb51a552b6c73d8615a61638bc4e1; 6b329c4f25873d5f43933a54fc09057536a90581; bcf2cf850c73f98bfc918f6bfb45b1c9b9681018; 422da46a029f64952dd29a7599e1d2d667571c99; 552a07e85f11ed3eea8cb931166f79257da2c99d; 3917efbfb57dab48fb5278874a975060ceefc844; 33e3b6b820e03b4c929e1aa1e89904e312206f4d; 17aceacffa08e607491a46f9cede72e6b5d34551; d178b7d68d9b55a21710c27bdb4c1145be3c9e64; e5449d37500e9333dfeb6a7d808b9d3ced86fb66; b0eaacddf63190bd7f41ba346cfbc814d5f96763; 667f54da16b65cffa1372c320a8c9fec65b828be,5c9c211cf2fd3eae9dd3c1f541f6a217c92541ec; 944006623073b2ea016b1040c64a74e857974bfc; 2f24dbb826f18a9105d87ce62886b57068c7eab5; 5b16c66b0fe36a1f05e4fdb086c23b31cae40f12; a834b996c8ba92ea55c6dd7f4a710de6d4b4dc7c; 88b7ceb335a3e88333a86d60e41454da21e2875e; c5750286ce8aa940e2186a03658efc5eb1acdde6; 8c955ea6d8b19bee9b5360c956a7a5ed947114fe; a02f20b52dbbfd43c132c39f658a7fb5d9d993d2; 5c9d00865152bc30b205fb5752127c7fc18490f9; 3f2d21ff9c3ccf6b0e7f4154ab1f9b81bdb7f62c; 90947c64553041bb83ce5fd97e7782a75ce77d25; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 8072deb6718a5535045f548ae49ce2a7347a051f; 3118d6b3909b4b397b2a05972c9a6daa20780672; 50992d36648c4b4f9da1b3c6aae11463c053f428; 5542cb9d840b6f38da1c147f3f4db47ce46f09f4; 9f20db02c5d4272b2f28ada970de7726a4260c56; 253fba2a2b4060c4adf47f625764182e67420334; d16c72ba11ba9ee16bc65ae6c2917a40541b36d0; e0e0987171a44030a44abf45137778dd69db725a; 9418a925177fe9137b3117ae24e67b7c8c99e2bc; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; ef117c95b92b68b751143155022a5c1a600afe5c; eed9e9bb926c3aa3332026ea00615c75bfdc4e22; f3e68175ab59b8a26c03c2776402c70a609e37e7; c63ce741ecccc27849662493ee5878e3a4c33d26; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; aeea8b16e648f744a32235f56258b9c961e34f66; 1a3555826ef68df33933414fb8a0724ad715e97d; e7e762bb1260118b80c55a96b0e4e2281f157829; 0e2fe165dc627220cc711e1e03b8bea599112884,International journal of computational biology and drug design,6 4,"

93c3a94badfc73bf68e9163be035a2167f6b35a5,Global transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing and DNA methylation patterns in highly enriched mesenchymal cells from young versus elderly women.,"Age-related bone loss in humans is associated with a decrease in bone formation relative to bone resorption, although the mechanisms for this impairment in bone formation with aging are not well understood. It is known that the precursors for the bone-forming osteoblasts reside in the mesenchymal cell population in bone marrow. Thus, in an effort to identify relevant genetic pathways that are altered with aging, we examined the gene expression and DNA methylation patterns from a highly enriched bone marrow mesenchymal cell population from young (mean age, 28.7 years) versus old (mean age, 73.3 years) women. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from these women were depleted of hematopoietic lineage (lin) and endothelial cells using a combination of magnetic- and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, yielding a previously characterized mesenchymal cell population (lin-/CD34-/CD31- cells) that is capable of osteoblast differentiation. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of freshly isolated cells (without in vitro culture) identified 279 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, false discovery rate [q]< 0.10) between the young and old subjects. Pathway analysis revealed statistically significant (all p < 0.05) alterations in protein synthesis and degradation pathways, as well as mTOR, gap junction, calcium, melatonin and NFAT signaling pathways. Further, Reduced Representational Bisulphite sequencing (RRBS DNA methylation sequencing) revealed significant differences in methylation between the young and old subjects surrounding the promoters of 1528 target genes that also exhibited significant differences in gene expression by RNAseq. In summary, these studies provide novel insights into potential pathways affected by aging in a highly enriched human mesenchymal cell population analyzed without the confounding effects of in vitro culture. Specifically, our finding of alterations in several genes and pathways leading to impaired protein synthesis and turnover with aging in bone marrow mesenchymal cells points to the need for further studies examining how these changes, as well as the other alterations with aging that we identified, may contribute to the age-related impairment in osteoblast formation and/or function.",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Matthew M.

9e63155cda388e175b8fc123c50ce07d6d8837b5,Isotretinoin temporally regulates distinct sets of genes in patient skin.,"TO THE EDITOR The goal of this study is to gain insight into putative pathways by which 13-cis retinoic acid (13-cisRA) improves acne by comparing the temporal changes in gene expression in the skin of acne patients. Gene array analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed on skin biopsies from patients at baseline and after 8 weeks of isotretinoin therapy and compared to data obtained at 1 week (Nelson et al., 2008). As 13-cisRA drastically decreases sebaceous gland size after 16 weeks (Goldstein et al., 1982); we chose an 8week time point to examine changes in skin histology and gene expression. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and were conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Eight patients who were prescribed isotretinoin for their severe acne enrolled in the study after giving informed consent and 5-mm punch biopsies of uninvolved skin were taken from their upper backs at baseline and 8 weeks of treatment. Demographic data are presented in Figure 1a. After 8 weeks, sebaceous gland size was reduced by 76% (4.17fold) compared to baseline (P1â„40.009) (Figure 1b and d). At 1 week, glands were decreased by approximately 49% (not significant; Figure 1c and d). Gene array expression analysis was performed on biopsies at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy.

7e550b314e5004e39a09f3958dba933c3bf128b9,"Second-generation p-values: Improved rigor, reproducibility, & transparency in statistical analyses","Verifying that a statistically significant result is scientifically meaningful is not only good scientific practice, it is a natural way to control the Type I error rate. Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value-a second-generation p-value (pÎ´)-that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (pÎ´ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (pÎ´ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 < pÎ´ < 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.",2018,Computer Science; Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jeffrey D Blume"", ids = ""2521353""); list(name = ""Lucy Dâ\200\231Agostino McGowan"", ids = ""1419469279""); list(name = ""William D.

While MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, a marker for TIA remains elusive. Proteomics offers a unique method to identify biomarkers of ischemic disease. Through the use of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we analyzed the serum of patients with transient neurologic symptoms in our emergency department to determine candidate proteins to serve as indicators of cerebral ischemia. Methods: Patients with transient neurologic symptoms were prospectively enrolled and their serum was obtained. Mass spectrometry was performed on the samples, and the results were searched against the Human Uniport database to identify the most likely proteins. The studentâ€™s t-test was utilized to compare protein levels between the different clinical conditions, and significance was determined by using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure for multiple comparison adjustments.

fb92bf772f43154b0567ccd92fb139f93a7e2959,Empirical approach to false discovery rate estimation in shotgun proteomics.,"Estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) for identified peptides is an important step in large-scale proteomic studies. We introduced an empirical approach to the problem that is based on the FDR-like functions of sets of peptide spectral matches (PSMs). These functions have close values for equal-sized sets with the same FDR and depend monotonically on the FDR of a set. We have found three of them, based on three complementary sources of data: chromatography, mass spectrometry, and sequences of identified peptides. Using a calibration on a set of putative correct PSMs these functions were converted into the FDR scale. The approach was tested on a set of approximately 2800 PSMs obtained from rat kidney tissue. The estimates based on all three data sources were rather consistent with each other as well as with one made using the target-decoy strategy.",2010,Chemistry; Medicine,"list(name = ""Anton Goloborodko"", ids = ""46381468""); list(name = ""Corina Mayerhofer"", ids = ""40098619""); list(name = ""Alexander R.

6ec77da8a0bb4707b26f240b7ec7ed0eea887c3c,Differential profile analysis of urinary cytokines in patients with overactive bladder: comment,"Dear Editor,We read with interest the recent paper by Ghoniem et al. [1]exploring urinary cytokineprofilesofwomen with overactivebladder (OAB) in comparison to both healthy controls andwomen with UTI. While we applaud their efforts to applysuchinnovativetechniques,wewishtoraiseconcernsregard-ing the statistical methods used to analyse data from thecytokine antibody arrays.The authors report p values <0.05 in association withtwofold overexpression for six of the cytokines assayedcomparing controls and women with OAB, and for 13 ofthe cytokines assayed comparing controls and women withUTI. Despite failing to reproduce the well-recognisedassociation between NGF and OAB, the authors concludedthat a subset of the cytokines were upregulated in both OABand UTI.We believe that these results can more plausibly beexplained by type I error. Simultaneously assaying 120 cyto-kines in three groups of women introduced the risk of type Ierror. The authors chose a significance level of 0.05, whichwould be expected to give 12 false positives among the 240hypotheses they tested. As an example, using the observedmean for NGF among controls and the pooled standard devi-ation, and applying the conservative Bonferroni correction,weestimatethe power ofthe study todetecta twofold changeas only 14%. Even adjusting the p values, using the lessconservative Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery ratemethod [2], suggests that the â€œtop hitsâ€ MCP-2 and MCP-1were no longer significantly different between controls andcases, with p00.106 and p00.364, respectively.Asweincreasinglyseeapplicationof â€œ'omicsâ€ technologiestourogynaecology,itisimportantthatweconsidertheperilsofmultiple hypothesis testing.

In a nested case-control study of 839 prevalent breast cancer cases and 1040 controls (frequency matched to cases on year of birth in 5-year strata), we evaluated 19 SNPs in eight genes coding for base excision repair (BER), BRCA1 interacting proteins and growth regulatory pathways for associations with breast cancer risk. The cases and controls were identified from a cohort of 83,748 female US radiologic technologists who responded to a postal survey in either the mid-1980s or the mid-1990s; updated cancer risk factor and family cancer history information was collected from all cases and controls at the time of blood collection by telephone interview. For most SNPs, subjects were genotyped using Taqman 5â€™-nuclease assays. Assuming a dominant mode of inheritance, multivariate logistic regression was used to assess associations (odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) between genotypes and breast cancer risk, controlling for race, age at menarche and age at first live birth. After adjustment for multiple comparisons (by controlling the false discovery rate), one variant was significantly associated with decreased breast cancer risk: BRCA2 N289H (HN and HH vs NN, OR=0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.8). No statistically significant associations with breast cancer were observed for: XRCC1 R194W, R280H and R399Q; APEX Q51H and D148E; POLD1 R119H; BRCA2 N372H and T1915M; BRIP -64 G>A and P919S; ZNF350 L66P, S472P, R501S and 1845 C>T; TGFÎ²1 L10P, P25R and T263I; and IGFBP3 -202 A>C. These results seem to suggest that a SNP in the BRCA2 gene may act as a low penetrance breast cancer risk allele. When variants were grouped by pathway, breast cancer risk appeared to decrease as the number of variant SNPs carried by individuals increased. For BRCA1 interacting proteins and BER genes, the p-values for trend were 0.008 and 0.09, respectively. No such relation was found for the growth regulatory factors (p-trend = 0.94). These analyses suggest a genetic complexity that may be under estimated when SNPs in single genes are analyzed or when pathway coverage is incomplete.",2005,Biology,"list(name = ""Parveen Bhatti"", ids = ""144334383""); list(name = ""Alice J.

af9d76621cbfa4179dfa271feacc1b648098c991,Quantitative Proteomic Identification of Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.,"There is significant morphologic, immunophenotypic and molecular overlap between some subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). In addition, recent studies reveal similar gene expression profiles in PMBCL and cHL suggesting a common cell of origin. We utilized a differential isotopic strategy to determine the global proteomic differences between cell lines derived from cHL (L428), DLBCL (SUDHL-9) and PMBCL (Karpas 1106P). Protein was collected from cell lysates and subjected to labeling by isobaric tags (iTRAQ) for relative quantification and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. 200 mg of total cell lysates from each cell line was used and liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses were performed in duplicate. The proteins were identified using X!Tandem. After normalization, quantitative data were subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) calculation to identify differentially expressed proteins through Mixture Modeling. Significantly differentially expressed proteins were scored at a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of â‰¤ 0.13. This approach yielded 66 proteins with differential expression patterns that were discriminative for the 3 different cell lines. Several proteins that have been previously reported to be differentially expressed between cHL and PMBCL were identified including Fascin, Galectin-1, Galectin-3, STAT1 and SWAP70. In addition, several previously unreported proteins involved in numerous cellular functions were differentially expressed (cell adhesion, signaling, immunity). We have validated a subset of these by Western blot (WB) analysis and immunohistochemistry. For example, the Ï€ class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTP), was over-expressed six-fold in K1106P cells vs. L428 cells, and virtually absent in the SUDHL-9 cell line, as confirmed by WB. This enzyme class has been shown to be overexpressed in many human cancers and to be involved in therapy refractoriness. More recently, GSTP has been implicated as a negative regulator of cellular death/apoptosis through the MAP kinase pathway. These factors, and its unusual absence in the SUDHL-9 cell line made GSTP a rational candidate for further functional analysis. Briefly, SUDHL-9 cells and the cHL cell lines L428 and KMH2 were exposed to increasing concentrations (20â€“80 Î¼M) of the GSTP inhibitor and thiol modifier molecule ethacrynic acid (EA), and subjected to viability assays (WST-1) and to WB for apoptotic markers. Both cHL cell lines were equally resistant to EA concentrations up to 60Î¼M by WST-1 assays, while SUDHL-9 cells were exquisitely sensitive, undergoing total cell necrosis at the lowest (20 Î¼M) concentration. WB analysis for markers of apoptosis showed a higher level of apoptosis in SUDHL-9 cells compared to the HL-derived KMH2 and L428 cells, as evidenced by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage into its 85 kDa apoptosis-related fragment. L428 cells, expressing 40% the GSTP levels of KMH2 cells by WB, were more susceptible to apoptosis at 60Î¼M EA than KMH2 cells, as evidenced by decrease in S-phase Kinase-associated Protein 2 (p45 SKP2 ), with concomitant increase in p27Kip1, a negative regulator of G1-S progression. These results demonstrate an inverse relationship between GSTP levels and susceptibility to EA-induced cell death in lymphoma. This study demonstrates the utility of large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics for the discovery of proteins that may serve as potential diagnostic marker panels for the distinction of PMBCL, DLBCL and cHL, as well as candidate therapeutic targets.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Mihaela D.

60e41510c1bb09cc401da0f58e467db2f4784ba8,Unique Circulating MicroRNA Profiles in HIV Infection,"Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. We aimed to determine the association between extracellular miRNAs and HIV infection. Design: Single-center, cross-sectional study. Methods: We analyzed the expression of 192 plasma-derived miRNAs in 69 HIV-infected individuals and 24 uninfected controls using TaqMan miRNA assays and a high-throughput Real-Time PCR instrument (Fluidigm). False discovery rate (FDR) was applied. Results: HIV-infected individuals and controls were similar in age, sex, and traditional risk factors. Among those with HIV, 72.5% were on antiretroviral therapy (ARVs) and 64% had an undetectable viral load. Twenty-nine miRNAs were differentially expressed in the plasma of HIV-infected individuals compared with controls (P < 0.05, FDR < 0.15). Nineteen miRNAs were differentially expressed among HIV+ subjects on ARVs, HIV+ subjects not on ARVs, and HIVâˆ’ subjects (P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.15). Thirty-four miRNAs were differentially expressed between HIVâˆ’ subjects and elite controllers (ie, suppressed viral loads despite the absence of ARVs; P < 0.05 and FDR < 0.15). These 34 miRNAs included miRs-29c, 146b, 223, and 382, which were previously reported to have intracellular roles in HIV latency, as well as miRs-126, 145, and let-7, which were previously shown to be differentially expressed in coronary artery disease among uninfected individuals. Conclusions: We demonstrate a unique expression profile of 29 miRNAs in HIV+ subjects and 34 miRNAs in elite controllers as compared to HIVâˆ’ subjects. These miRNA signatures may be useful in further elucidating mechanisms of viral and immunological control and may have diagnostic or prognostic value in HIV-associated coronary artery disease.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Venkata Anupama Narla"", ids = ""4704762""); list(name = ""Nirav R Bhakta"", ids = ""5157369""); list(name = ""Jane E.

e11847bbd090190e92aca9c70e32efab3ed8215d,Validation of markers with non-additive effects on milk yield and fertility in Holstein and Jersey cows,"BackgroundIt has been suggested that traits with low heritability, such as fertility, may have proportionately more genetic variation arising from non-additive effects than traits with higher heritability, such as milk yield. Here, we performed a large genome scan with 408,255 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to identify chromosomal regions associated with additive, dominance and epistatic (pairwise additiveâ€‰Ã—â€‰additive) variability in milk yield and a measure of fertility, calving interval, using records from a population of 7,055 Holstein cows. The results were subsequently validated in an independent set of 3,795 Jerseys.ResultsWe identified genomic regions with validated additive effects on milk yield on Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) 5, 14 and 20, whereas SNPs with suggestive additive effects on fertility were observed on BTA 5, 9, 11, 18, 22, 27, 29 and the X chromosome. We also confirmed genome regions with suggestive dominance effects for milk yield (BTA 2, 3, 5, 26 and 27) and for fertility (BTA 1, 2, 3, 7, 23, 25 and 28). A number of significant epistatic effects for milk yield on BTA 14 were found across breeds. However on close inspection, these were likely to be associated with the mutation in the diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) gene, given that the associations were no longer significant when the additive effect of the DGAT1 mutation was included in the epistatic model.ConclusionsIn general, we observed a low statistical power (high false discovery rates and small number of significant SNPs) for non-additive genetic effects compared with additive effects for both traits which could be an artefact of higher dependence on linkage disequilibrium between markers and causative mutations or smaller size of non-additive effects relative to additive effects. The results of our study suggest that individual non-additive effects make a small contribution to the genetic variation of milk yield and fertility.

a918aba1a5ec3f64645f85a78bc71ca951b40245,HLA Is a Determinant Of The Ethnic Predisposition Of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,"Introduction Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) displays remarkable ethnic predisposition for Caucasians with a lower incidence of disease in African Americans and relative sparing of Asian Populations. In addition, CLL displays one of the highest familial predispositions of all hematologic malignancies, yet the genetic basis for these differences is not fully defined. Large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) of CLL have identified the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) locus and other loci associated with the development of CLL but the contribution of individual HLA alleles has not been extensively examined. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) registry contains a large number of disease cases and donor controls across multiple populations as well as high quality classical HLA typing, making it a powerful source of data for inferring HLA associations for hematologic diseases. Using the NMDP dataset, we report the largest study of the HLA associations for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to date. Methods Cases consisted of 2,689 US Caucasian and 298 African-American patients with CLL who underwent HLA typing performed for allogeneic donor search reported to the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). 50,000 controls were randomly selected for each population from US individuals who voluntarily enrolled in the NMDP unrelated donor registry. To address ambiguous haplotype phasing inherent to HLA typing, we used population haplotype frequencies to calculate probabilities for genotypes for each possible pair of HLA haplotypes. We then incorporated this typing ambiguity into a statistical model using multiple imputation, allowing us to report high-resolution allele, haplotype, and genotype associations. Patients and controls were compared using multivariate logistic regression using a generalized linear model for the covariates of age, birthdate, gender, and geographical location. To control for multiple testing, we adjusted p-values using False Discovery Rate with a cutoff of 0.05. Results We identified several HLA alleles that are associated with an increased susceptibility to the development of CLL as well as several alleles that are protective in the Caucasian as well as the African American (AA) US population. In Caucasians, A*02:01 (OR = 1.203, p = 0.00053), B*15:01 (OR = 1.264, p = 0.0105), B*38:01 (OR = 1.396, p = 0.0198), DRB1*04:02 (OR = 1.675, p = 0.0006) and DRB1*07:01 (OR = 1.223, p = 0.0006) were predisposing and A*01:01 (OR = 0.849, p = 0.01077), B*08:01 (OR = 0.853, p = 0.0437), B*27:05 (OR = 0.743, p = 0.0356) were protective. For African Americans, we find a different collection of high resolution HLA alleles: B*37:01, B*15:17 and DRB1*09:01 were predisposing to the development of CLL (OR 3.017, 3.089 and 2.144, respectively) with highly statistically significant p-values (0.0344, 0.0344, 0.00057, respectively). At the allele family level, B*44 was found to be protective in both Caucasian (OR = 0.843, p = 0.0115) and AA populations (OR = 0.485, p = 0.0309). The allele family C*07 (OR 0.848, p = 0.0046) was protective in Caucasians while C*04 was protective in AA populations (OR = 0.645, p = 0.0422). Association results also revealed additive effects of individual predisposing alleles within the same haplotype, such as the A*02:01âˆ¼C*06:02âˆ¼B*13:02âˆ¼DRB1*07:01 haplotype, which had a higher odds ratio (OR = 2.2, p = 0.000086) than either A*02:01 or DRB1*07:01. We performed a population risk analysis by applying the currently identified allelic disease associations for Caucasians to the known allele frequency seen in other populations, and determined that HLA allele frequency differences contribute to the lower risk of CLL development for both the AA and Asian populations. Conclusions We have identified several HLA associations that confer increased risk of development of CLL in both U.S. Caucasians and African Americans as well as several protective alleles. These results confirm the previously identified association with HLA*02:01 (OR 1.32, Di Bernardo, et al) with highly similar odds ratio. In addition, we identify many HLA allele associations that have not been previously observed due to low statistical power. Differences in HLA predispositions and HLA allele frequency between Caucasian, AA and Asian populations contribute to the difference in incidence of CLL in these populations and may confer inherent biologic differences due to their impact on immune surveillance.

The mining result is the Boolean product of two matrices, approximating the input dataset. The Boolean product is a disjunction of rank-1 binary matrices, each describing a feature-relation, called pattern, for a group of samples. Yet, there are no guarantees that any of the returned patterns do not actually arise from noise, i.e., are false discoveries. In this paper, we propose and discuss the usage of the false discovery rate in the unsupervised BMF setting. We prove two bounds on the probability that a found pattern is constituted of random Bernoulli-distributed noise. Each bound exploits a specific property of the factorization which minimizes the approximation errorâ€”yielding new insights on the minimizers of Boolean matrix factorization. This leads to improved BMF algorithms by replacing heuristic rank selection techniques with a theoretically well-based approach. Our empirical demonstration shows that both bounds deliver excellent results in various practical settings.",2014,,"list(name = ""Nico Piatkowski"", ids = ""2374206""); list(name = ""Katharina Morik"", ids = ""1752599"")",,44f0269512a0d93eb8cf8d83a8a55245be16b34c; 1dd3ab8929e099611a7afd4ec4a672401e5952b2; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; acc8b6b916d04e689fde52f81c7c773269b2dfae; 96be192aee9652e4e3b42dce148133768f2d33fe; 7d1ddf9821ca344bd8e9d56e5af4346c826cb691; 3770927e25cccbe5e0b20dd94d01f2c5dbe05003; f5016f1f2fc47aeaa983ed7323af34a51aa2473c; 70fb2b55796680f32e8bff6b85e1fbe6c6b8feaf; e720b8b8494b2ea1bc8ecf5841050e0f1fdd84db; cb4330fe065e1034a299211eeb29fe04742e8cf6,,,
9b740f3fb87770809e424eea771307320b2d021e,OncoMiner: A Pipeline for Bioinformatics Analysis of Exonic Sequence Variants in Cancer,"With recent developments in high-throughput sequencing technologies, whole exome sequencing (WES) data have become a rich source of information from which scientists can explore the overall mutational landscape in patients with various types of cancers. We have developed the OncoMiner pipeline for mining WES data to identify exonic sequence variants, link them with associated research literature, visualize their genomic locations, and compare their occurrence frequencies among different groups of subjects. This pipeline, written in Python on an IBM High-Performance Cluster, HPC Version 3.2, is accessible at oncominer.utep.edu. It begins with taking all the identified missense mutations of an individual and translating the affected genes based on Genome Reference Consortiumâ€™s human genome build 37. After constructing a list of exonic sequence variants from the individual, OncoMiner uses PROVEAN scoring scheme to assess each variantâ€™s functional consequences, followed by PubMed searches to link the variant to previous reports. Users can then select subjects to visualize their PROVEAN score profiles with Circos diagrams and to compare the proportions of variant occurrences between different groups using Fisherâ€™s exact tests. As such statistical comparisons typically involve many hypothesis tests, options for multiple-test corrections are included to control familywise error or false discovery rates. We have used OncoMiner to analyze variants of cancer-related genes in 14 samples taken from patients with cancer, six from cancer cell lines, and ten from normal individuals. Variants showing significant differences between the cancer and control groups are identified and experiments are being designed to elucidate their roles in cancer.",2016,Biology,"list(name = ""Ming Ying Leung"", ids = ""143681640""); list(name = ""Joseph A.

505e4a380736c46aba039350bc25ffab4575744e,Identification of Previously Unrecognized CD1d-Restricted Peripheral T Cell Lymphomas (PTCLs) in Mouse and Human Reveals Blocking Anti-CD1d Monoclonal Antibodies As a New Therapeutic Possibility in PTCLs,"Background. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) originate from post-thymic T cells but compared to B-cell lymphomas the exact cell of origin is usually unknown except for angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma arising from a follicular helper T-cell. Furthermore, no recurrent cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities are identified in PTCLs. Recently, recurrent impairment of the p53 pathway has been pointed out in PTCLs. However, p53 knockout (KO) mice are known to develop immature thymic T-cell lymphomas and solid tumors but surprisingly PTCLs have not been reported for more than 20 years in those mice.

NKT cells are a T-cell subset responsive to glycolipids presented by CD1d, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like antigen-presenting molecule, in contrast to conventional T cells, which recognize peptide antigens. Two types of NKT cells have been described so far: type I or invariant NKT cells (iNKT) that express a Valpha14-Jalpha18 (in mice) or Valpha24-Jalpha18 (in humans) constant chain and type II NKT cells that express a variable TCR but are CD1d-dependent as well. Most type II NKT cells are of alpha/beta phenotype but CD1d-restricted gamma/delta T cells have also been described in mice and humans.

Methods. The development of PTCLs in p53 KO mice (B6.129S2- Trp53tm1Tyj /J) was studied. Identification of PTCLs was made by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. Gene expression profile analysis (GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array, Affymetrix) was performed to characterize lymphomas developed in the mouse model. Transfer experiments were done by intravenously retro-orbital injection into syngeneic, immunocompetent C57Bl/6J WT animals or immunocompromised CD3e-/- mice. Therapeutic trials in mice were performed with the use of blocking anti-CD1d monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (clone HB323; BioXcell).

Results. We found that p53 KO mice developed well-known and characterized thymic T-cell lymphomas and solid tumors as previously described. However, about 20% of p53 KO mice spontaneously developed a previously unrecognized entity of PTCLs originating from CD1d-restricted iNKT cells (ie type I NKT cells) referred to as NKTLs for NKT lymphomas thereafter. Both alpha-galactosylceramide-CD1d tetramer staining and unique Valpha14-Jalpha18 TCR rearrangement confirmed the iNKT nature of these lymphomas.

Chronic injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae ( Spn ), reported to express glycolipid antigens activating NKT cells, significantly increased the incidence of these NKTLs compared to a control group of p53 KO mice injected with PBS ( P =0.03). Gene expression profile analysis indicated a significant down-regulation of genes in the TCR signaling pathway of NKTLs (false discovery rate q -value=0.01 by gene set enrichment analysis) suggesting an underlying antigenic chronic stimulation as previously reported in chronically activated T cells ([Figure 1][1]). Moreover, NKTLs were characterized by upregulation of PD-1 and loss of NK1.1 expression compared to resting NKT cells ( P <0.01 for both), which are features of activated and anergic iNKT cells. Altogether, those data indicate that NKTLs in mice could arise from chronically activated iNKT cells by endogenous or exogenous glycolipids. Furthermore, in vivo TCR/CD1d interactions were required for NKTLs survival after transfer in recipient mice and the use of blocking anti-CD1d mAb significantly prolonged mice overall survival (logrank P <0.001, [Figure 2][2]).

We did not identify human PTCLs arising from type I iNKT cells by using alphaGalCer-CD1d tetramer staining. However, using sulfatide-loaded CD1d tetramers (ie another type of glycolipid-CD1d tetramer identifying type II NKT cells), we identified CD1d-restricted human PTCLs among gamma/delta hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas (HSTLs) and PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) expressing the Vd1 TCR but not the Vd2 TCR ([Figure 3][3]).

Conclusion. This demonstrates for the first time the existence of human PTCLs arising from gamma/delta CD1d-restricted type II NKT cells. These results refine the classification of PTCLs in humans by identifying a new cell of origin and pave the way for the development of blocking anti-CD1d antibodies for therapeutic purposes.

2d59db13df6b787b781ab1860ed6545aa2626408,Temporal profiling of gene expression during neurogenesis and remodeling in the olfactory epithelium at short intervals after target ablation.,"Neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium (OE) is induced by olfactory bulbectomy (OBX), which effectively axotomizes olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and removes their synaptic targets, resulting in apoptosis. We used Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide arrays to investigate changes in gene expression during initiation of signaling in pathways that regulate apoptosis and neurogenesis in the murine OE at 2, 8, 16, and 48 hr after bilateral OBX compared to that in sham-operated controls. We focused on regulation of a defined set of genes associated with apoptosis, stem/progenitor cell regulation, and cell cycle progression because of the activation of these processes in OE degeneration and remodeling after OBX. After data scrubbing and categorical analysis, one-way analysis of variance identified 72 genes (4.9% of the present known genes) as being regulated significantly (P < 0.05) at one or more points; 50 were defined as regulated differentially with the false discovery rate at 10%. Significant changes in gene expression occurred in all categories as early as 2 hr post-OBX, with the greatest number of differentially regulated genes at 16 and 48 hr. Hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation coefficients were used to identify similarities in patterns of gene expression changes within and across categories. Validation was carried out with SuperArray macroarrays and real-time RT-PCR. Our results confirmed the participation of many genes in known signaling pathways and identified changes in the expression of 42 genes not identified previously as participating in apoptosis and neurogenesis in the OE. Additionally, our analyses indicated the early involvement of genes regulating cytoskeletal reorganization and angiogenesis in the response to OBX. These studies are an important first step in defining early time-dependent changes in gene expression after target ablation that lead to neurogenesis in the olfactory sensory epithelium.",2005,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Thomas V.

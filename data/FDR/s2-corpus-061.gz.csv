3af12385cbb6e1d7257ea75984fc42fadd80c4fd,Relationship Between Cognitive Assessment and Balance Measures in Adolescents Referred for Vestibular Physical Therapy After Concussion.,"OBJECTIVE
To examine the relationship between cognitive and balance performance in adolescents with concussion.


DESIGN
Retrospective case series.


SETTING
Tertiary.


PATIENTS
Sixty patients.


INTERVENTIONS
Correlation analyses were performed to describe the relationship between symptoms, cognitive measure, and balance measure at the time of initiation of vestibular physical therapy.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Cognitive performance was assessed using the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT). The dizziness and balance function measures included dizziness severity rating, Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Functional Gait Assessment, gait speed, Timed ""UP and GO,"" Five Times Sit to Stand, and Sensory Organization Test (SOT). To account for multiple comparisons, the False Discovery Rate method was used.


RESULTS
Performance measures of balance were significantly correlated with cognitive measures. Greater total symptom scores were related to greater impairment in the ABC and DHI (r = 0.35-0.39, P â‰¤ 0.008) and worse performance in condition 2 of the SOT (r = -0.48, P = 0.004). Among the ImPACT composite scores, lower memory scores were correlated with impaired balance performance measures (r = 0.37-0.59, P â‰¤ 0.012). Lower visual memory was also correlated with worse ABC scores.


CONCLUSIONS
The significant relationships reported between the cognitive performance scores and balance measures may reflect that similar levels of functioning exist across domains in individuals with protracted recovery who receive vestibular physical therapy.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
The weak-to-moderate relationships warrant the continuous use of multiple domains of assessment. A better understanding to the relationships between the domains of functioning after concussion may improve the overall management approach for adolescents with concussion.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Bara A Alsalaheen"", ids = ""6113872""); list(name = ""Susan L.

c193e1e99f8822dcd96cc63bb51c8bf2af40b88d,Semiquantitative Analysis of Clinical Heat Stress in Clostridium difficile Strain 630 Using a GeLC/MS Workflow with emPAI Quantitation,"Clostridium difficile is considered to be the most frequent cause of infectious bacterial diarrhoea in hospitals worldwide yet its adaptive ability remains relatively uncharacterised. Here, we used GeLC/MS and the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) calculation to determine proteomic changes in response to a clinically relevant heat stress. Reproducibility between both biological and technical replicates was good, and a 37Â°C proteome of 224 proteins was complemented by a 41Â°C proteome of 202 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate. Overall, 236 C. difficile proteins were identified and functionally categorised, of which 178 were available for comparative purposes. A total of 65 proteins (37%) were modulated by 1.5-fold or more at 41Â°C compared to 37Â°C and we noted changes in the majority of proteins associated with amino acid metabolism, including upregulation of the reductive branch of the leucine fermentation pathway. Motility was reduced at 41Â°C as evidenced by a 2.7 fold decrease in the flagellar filament protein, FliC, and a global increase in proteins associated with detoxification and adaptation to atypical conditions was observed, concomitant with decreases in proteins mediating transcriptional elongation and the initiation of protein synthesis. Trigger factor was down regulated by almost 5-fold. We propose that under heat stress, titration of the GroESL and dnaJK/grpE chaperones by misfolded proteins will, in the absence of trigger factor, prevent nascent chains from emerging efficiently from the ribosome causing translational stalling and also an increase in secretion. The current work has thus allowed development of a heat stress model for the key cellular processes of protein folding and export.",2014,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Nigel G Ternan"", ids = ""5345007""); list(name = ""Shailesh Jain"", ids = ""49837588""); list(name = ""Robert Leslie James Graham"", ids = ""152987180""); list(name = ""Geoff McMullan"", ids = ""3588916"")",312fa0dcfda4bf4114255f515afd5b7cd471e6c8; 185c4057b22c0bcb3bd02f8cdcc7a45942dfd070; ecd881c77fa8567db24db752cc8d46d79e789fde,e7d47d186b4df62c0da0a23b701051e54a976141; 41d3f405155c8b45a18c37c22cd75ad99f98ab2c; f68a232a97f54c0c7cd579ffcda339c93abdb4b9; f76e3cf5bc42762a9a47f734429f06c74aa967d4; 5dc7237f225f72fcbca8cef7bcb83591a14608a1; 0293cdff13f236bfc8b0348ce017a102810a23e7; b1c201273d8b56639638f8a1da5ed15564a2fd00; 550a8208888bbbbbb39704111f9a067eccc2112a; ad28b6402c036d63417db8c958ce011a403825ef; b7399411ff91a388d49197b28c6a9830fcff0abf; 2952f15e51389857d9f6df703ec09276e30ea927; aef8eeeec60d768edabe51e0bad6b51ef94e7c6f; 3a4075be4ece99ddc8f0686abab3442c7b04bbab; ed87e8e1e956c9a42b6fb4499558a35daae43a86; 1ab74fb68555afbf2f5caa49fc2ecae1208f114f; 8df9f324a8dbd6621e188dfce2fbe83a3a3a3eb0; 9638d3ab9b8a9729f767c37bc2e2411f6d90a2bf; cbc35dab82b6c28f75d8f04ae8f120a7b9d64b8e; 63c306514124a78eaf46c8d59cdfe7eaf1a7fa48; af2a2d31cfaa8864abe6d1d1a8868d92ed7b8d3f; cc68995833d4c270b048e7fb7e58dbe73bcada39; dc6a62219a82ccdb02767682de349cb273d9dd5c; e29d2d199ac090eb347764f1195483e5ca79aa23; 17bdde969921a2b77813b48d35e773b424f21187; 06f2e2ebcef15b1779b9e71becfba39be35e340f; e7a8c0913d685a6c967be7dc179759688a042290; a99ac3c7ad71df652b5abc95b8bcb0c60214e70f; d468e0061ccb2c47f0c2340ff2fcc2f9ffe0d9a3; 1269deb8ca2aed2cf7014fd77e512e3bc2978419; 4945d3c57d736f5f7f4ff36a8f6fa1ce602881f7; 8738fe6a59428745e36cef386940f32d9351370d; 9fd12870195da7af5a2491cf2366b9f179ced0be; 4184072a79f910ffae834fa07e4f1d7039d08d06; 9ec3f543e798b26825c9ed2482a92fe83cc89b37; 1b6f97ff8bbb8deb561008a4da31a5e15c7f4867; c84697dc646079f05e368b0c771683d358d2f6c2; 7289f6ccbe433da35bd8b14fb782b665af909b46; 87d064ef64ad15f032d7086ef1c260bf503210d5; c04a76dfb1a912bfb94510e71a3d239ea5616d12; 8f3387cd044b117584f88c559fb96841b2c80436; 7139038776607421a7bb9db9332e928773a2ff3d; 126d9ddcbe285560e88f6643e743bc5f256bef6f; b8030ade9d862ffad0dcbd51bb86252b29fce016; 9d646cb4a9eb2681d37f4102b22508213e32a67f; 377aa0f7896d32d018512b099ff4ac0f50fba63b; a3d65ed3e7105febd5175cfed88560c0caae988d; a8b1bca3ba3ec4565b3fcc901305517c96156e1c; 1ef7bbcaf2afa80d86238801a225a6a10862e9ac; 3e017818ac27bb1f9fa08de12ad87bbd506469d3; b7bdc9ea07e123a843e3d28b598b3e641c9a83a3; 5cb1cc0c2bf9900875d165b00871ab896f2fc45d; 88d8a7737bc8330d7a4a3e1e66a1901c62606ba4; a65edba9f58f721cdf1c6e10f64d0c81b0b06087; 04b3c9d533b837efa3c328b5122e9bcc887f2a3f; 2f848293eb741f867190cdc2e0ae8b4a0c44e69b; 0735370266e12a08e598206504c2579a32e09726; a564a972e96d6113abf36f9ca55e3bd86c0af036; 2d98e9f815cc41f6b93417f7224a16d7d453ed14; 3cc7a645fdd6f110b9a1f7812fe3cd522594e439; 516899df75528f3eb5de2040def558521bbac0c4; 37d830ce38a2feb33139bb005b4984d36576f049; e0d7de55f8c11a9d4afd5ad807751d55406795b2; f1a9ceb8c3d1bc0569fc3708e76ae635b8e70ddb; c4a88c43e830630011b0847f61a2722fa90eb83d; 7b8c048d47d2c4325995c88d09544c16db9c2cac; 96cc147e41289a6ad77ab98f7f78fde60fdb2489; c0a16f455211ec1f80a3b3cc52544c72867188c9; f74484598a2a26b7db86f6fdb096e5e1c5569a9d; 1782376f607f5606b90dd5a46c9729abb46786eb; c0dfa4a40d886df860db71cc9cb954d9ab500e6b; e776b9f24f1c85c93ef0e27dcf92298c68e698bd; b4a67cdd195ecaba667169c75859cb4473260e55; b5b10a93cbc209adc5b842e32881ba9cbef847d5; 8195c06781de25a5e61ec897904b9262da6c25b5; 0d063335b2bd2bf9cfb0794b6d3c90cb39e8893a; e7a80ada02b7098645d3e4e5cee9e0093d6b29a5; 5344f1e81c8646bde899034d9b091f4e4bc5f69c; 54ecbcadd2e7ef8dd2e3a638c1dbffc4b12f0016; 1b0c06fa4a7a525a288a4c4cd9de44340d4fc671; 801283382b91a4d19760fd8e7aba7f07dd8ce191; 5ef59b63aab982778cecbf43bab62e178103f806; 25d5e1b8d02fddbb639d883539a88c760aae2589; ddf7ddf89f5c49dd0815a5efac1ce35e2686a869; f9c31e5ccb1b6eeef8136c1c403a4be02c98321f; 7e85a0f3940051690598ac887e5686009990e754; 8f55697b7ca4f76d5546e27facb2fd079cb4081c; c1ad3c206c89587d198c3949b581e2b7769794f1; 2e29a05fbebc93e94b10211b93841fb12994042d; ff5b42443c8e378f95e78b628fd94215aa5fb8b0; 4f896bb92e49f078e33d120f709aed18134df412; 3d63a7d9d5a530dff68d8d655200c63c5ea77768; 87985ae54a7f0cb995a2873ed87365d72bf9a6a9; 57f8bf1ec2f15dafd37b0e8402e67c70274eaf05; bd84e683af004c49e2cfbf5dc44e7bb135c99e41; b6b509ea6159d7d59823a220b92c908bf6666bdf; 43bdf3e816e8aacebb70ac5dee21729c6fc4f451; 475a5028d252d54e6a3ee74450b7dcd578b9228f; 9e99a1ea3a0847e757a015e8853cdf840ec5bd78; 85d8cd1ec542ed5a9828baf32932c9276fc88455; 7adb9aa8ac1baac1de8ae33a82eb8a1309ab8d3e,PLoS ONE,9,s4 - s11
116832b52101ee86ca22394cc45c08a52bf9bfa7,SA 09 Estimating the False Discovery Rate using SAS,"This paper gives an exposition of some recently developed methods of estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) in the setting of multiple comparisons and discusses their implementation with SAS and JMP. The FDR provides an interpretable quantification of error and an alternative to the familywise error rate that may be suitable in situations such as high throughput genomics experiments. SAS code using the SAS/MACRO, SAS/STAT, and SAS/IML facilities is presented to compute a popular estimate of FDR associated with any chosen critical region. Q-values, which are the FDR analog of p-values, are obtained and used to reproduce plots generated by the R package â€œqvalueâ€ that inform the choice of this critical region. A key parameter is estimated either by fitting a smoothing spline (PROC TPSPLINE) or a twocomponent mixture to the p-value histogram via maximum likelihood (PROC NLMIXED). A microarray example is presented along with guidelines for implementation in JMP. INTRODUCTION The false discovery rate (FDR) has received much attention as an alternative way of quantifying type I errors in multiple comparisons problems. One reason for this attention is the development of high throughput technology in the field of genomics that allow for experiments to test many hypotheses simultaneously. Microarray technology, for example, has facilitated the measurement of expression intensity for thousands of genes at once across different conditions in a single experiment. As an illustration, consider the histogram of p-values in the top left of Figure 2, taken from F -tests in a microarray experiment (Li et al., 2006) to investigate gene expression during gestation of H. parviporum, a fungal pathogen causing root rot in Norway Spruce. The experiment measured mRNA abundance from tissue harvested at timepoints 0, 18, 36, 72 and 120 hours post-germination in a completely randomized design with three biologically independent samples per timepoint. Single channel expression measurements on 384 cDNA clones (â€œgenesâ€) are made for each replicate. The histogram gives the distribution of p-values from 384 separate F -tests for a treatment effect, each based on four and twelve numerator and denominator degrees of freedom, respectively. The preponderance of small p-values provides evidence that gene expression is not constant across all five timepoints, but there are so many significance tests being conducted that care must still be taken to avoid type I errors due to multiplicity. Traditional approaches include strong and weak control of familywise error rates, using techniques such as the Bonferroni correction. Warnings about these error rates in the presence of multiplicity are automatically reported in output produced by PROC GLM whenever p-values for pairwise comparisons are requested without multiplicity adjustment in MEANS or LSMEANS statements. PROC MULTTEST can also be used to carry out a vast array of multiple comparisons procedures and provide multiplicity-adjusted p-values.",2008,,"list(name = ""J. A.

MiRNA expressions were up-and down-regulated by its mimics and inhibitors, respectively. Cellular proliferation was measured by MTS assay. Results: Out of 449 miRNAs assayed, we identified 21 miRNAs differentially expressed in HCC tissues by the false discovery rate procedure. Among them, high expression of miR-345 was significantly associated with longer disease-free survival (p=0.01). In vitro study showed that inhibition of miR-345 in cultured HCC cells significantly increased HCC cell proliferation, while enhancement of miR-345 expression significantly decreased HCC proliferation (both p<0.05). In addition, enforced miR-345 expression caused multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 down regulation, whereas anti-miR 345 induced its up-regulation. Conclusions: These results indicate that miR-345 expression in HCC tissues may predict a low risk of HCC recurrence. In addition, the modulation of miR-345 expression may be useful as an anti-proliferation strategy for HCC treatment.",2011,,"list(name = ""Jung Eun Choi"", ids = ""6058284""); list(name = ""Wonhee Hur"", ids = ""39753477""); list(name = ""Kwang Soo Lyoo"", ids = ""50743176""); list(name = ""Sung Woo Hong"", ids = ""4634484""); list(name = ""Sung Woo Kim"", ids = ""6097158""); list(name = ""Yong Ki Lee"", ids = ""49380400""); list(name = ""Chang Wook Kim"", ids = ""1995819""); list(name = ""Sang wook Choi"", ids = ""2403893""); list(name = ""Seung Kew Yoon"", ids = ""3980442"")",,,,,

Despite widespread use, there is no standard method for assessing the accuracy of a dataset and alignment strategy after resequencing. We present a framework and tool for determining the overall accuracies of an input read dataset, alignment and SNP-calling method providing an isolate in that dataset has a corresponding, or closely related reference sequence available. In addition to this tool for comparing False Discovery Rates (FDR), we include a method for determining homozygous and heterozygous positions from an alignment using binomial probabilities for an expected error rate.

1e8b7c2373435e2fd66ade84aa05e299db6cc05f,Evidence of Altered Mitochondrial Protein Expression After Chronic Ethanol Consumption in the Aged Estrogenâ€Deficient Female Rat Heart,"BACKGROUND
Estrogen loss has been implicated to increase the risk of alcoholic cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women. The purpose of this study was to identify novel mitochondrial protein targets for the treatment of alcoholic cardiomyopathy in aged women using a state-of-the-art proteomic approach. We hypothesized that chronic ethanol (EtOH) ingestion exacerbates maladaptive mitochondrial protein expression in the aged female heart.


METHODS
Adult (3Â months) and aged (18Â months) F344 ovary-intact or ovariectomized (OVX) rats were randomly assigned an EtOH or control Lieber-DeCarli ""all-liquid"" diet for 20Â weeks. Proteomic analyses were conducted in mitochondria isolated from left ventricles using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) 8plex labeling and mass spectrometry (nÂ =Â 3 to 5/group).


RESULTS
After EtOH, significant differences (false discovery rate <5%) were observed in electron transport chain components (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2) as well as proteins involved in lipid metabolism (2,4 dienoyl-CoA reductase) and cellular defense (catalase), suggesting a possible link to congestive heart failure. Directional changes in protein levels were confirmed by Western blotting. Additionally, EtOH significantly reduced state 3 mitochondrial respiration in all groups, yet only reduced respiratory control index in the aged OVX rat heart (pÂ <Â 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Collectively, the data reveal that EtOH-induced changes in the mitochondrial proteome exacerbate cardiac dysfunction in aged and estrogen-deficient hearts, but not in adult.

0cb64a5dc4b4ebca3a3e1d3d50c4ae74ce7c5af2,A unified approach to false discovery rate estimation,"BackgroundFalse discovery rate (FDR) methods play an important role in analyzing high-dimensional data. There are two types of FDR, tail area-based FDR and local FDR, as well as numerous statistical algorithms for estimating or controlling FDR. These differ in terms of underlying test statistics and procedures employed for statistical learning.ResultsA unifying algorithm for simultaneous estimation of both local FDR and tail area-based FDR is presented that can be applied to a diverse range of test statistics, including p-values, correlations, z- and t-scores. This approach is semipararametric and is based on a modified Grenander density estimator. For test statistics other than p-values it allows for empirical null modeling, so that dependencies among tests can be taken into account. The inference of the underlying model employs truncated maximum-likelihood estimation, with the cut-off point chosen according to the false non-discovery rate.ConclusionThe proposed procedure generalizes a number of more specialized algorithms and thus offers a common framework for FDR estimation consistent across test statistics and types of FDR. In comparative study the unified approach performs on par with the best competing yet more specialized alternatives.

482ed816883fe64032cc12ca5e39baaddecdcfdf,Exercise-responsive phosphoproteins in the heart.,"Endurance exercise improves cardiac performance and affords protection against cardiovascular diseases but the signalling events that mediate these benefits are largely unexplored. Phosphorylation is a widely studied post-translational modification involved in intracellular signalling, and to discover novel phosphorylation events associated with exercise we have profiled the cardiac phosphoproteome response to a standardised exercise test to peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Male Wistar rats (346Â±18g) were assigned to 3 independent groups (n=6, in each) that were familiarised with running on a motorised treadmill within a metabolic chamber. Animals performed a graded exercise test and were killed either immediately (0h) after or 3h after terminating the test at a standardised physiological end point (i.e. peak oxygen uptake; VO2peak). Control rats were killed at a similar time of day to the exercised animals, to minimise possible circadian effects. Cardiac proteins were digested with trypsin and phosphopeptides were enriched by selective binding to titanium dioxide (TiO2). Phosphopeptides were analysed by liquid chromatography and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, and phosphopeptides were quantified by MS1 intensities and identified against the UniProt knowledgebase using MaxQuant (data are available via ProteomeXchange, ID PXD006646). The VO2peak of rats in the 0h and 3h groups was 66Â±5mlkg-1min-1 and 69.8Â±5mlkg-1min-1, respectively. Proteome profiling detected 1169 phosphopeptides and one-way ANOVA found 141 significant (P<0.05 with a false discovery rate of 10%) differences. Almost all (97%) of the phosphosites that were responsive to exercise are annotated in the PhosphoSitePlus database but, importantly, the majority of these have not previously been associated with the cardiac response to exercise. More than two-thirds of the exercise-responsive phosphosites were different from those identified in previous phosphoproteome profiling of the cardiac response to Î²1-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Moreover, we report entirely new phosphorylation sites on 4 cardiac proteins, including S81 of muscle LIM protein, and identified 7 exercise-responsive kinases, including myofibrillar protein kinases such as obscurin, titin and the striated-muscle-specific serine/threonine kinase (SPEG) that may be worthwhile targets for future investigation.",2017,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hongbo Guo"", ids = ""50353599""); list(name = ""Ruth Isserlin"", ids = ""2376613""); list(name = ""Andrew Emili"", ids = ""2143959""); list(name = ""Jatin G Burniston"", ids = ""2612777"")",6be5f125e79e9c72712a0ed4972961061e3a0d45,fefb8a7e1814ff5b43d1c939c11bc40451965bd6; 971d7457aea76c743c05f17de9f31110e2dc37aa; d4e47e2c914f6cecdcfa8fd5c0aac2566fbdc4a7; 39c3f5a06b0a44b47a21ac4933c53d1cf9924718; 4752050ced761358f2c5eaa6beb88011dbcdfabb; 9627cf8f8f9fee540ff066c67ecdf6cf87541937; db1bd8c9873eab63bf252a5cb1e9c30ec0393163; 6a921d8ccff7db9a6a2114482274c45e9179d4ee; db9ef0ea3c85476db9c1110e07eb1ed9c98f75ef; fa60b6806050255a77699bd0f9f5d824884c5162; 8245665b69a1355a9bc562f3b2cff7546f2bce46; b9de3b7150cc254356bd579ef99e0714c1f3b39a; b54db88ed2c85485e446853c023d5072ee16a3d5; 17df94808e0f7b3b6a0265d80c499fae2c1b44b4; 4eac74576eba42db8128cdff06591e59200d14f9; b995f88d8818725954d070d53852e9c11eac92ae; 47af13f225b7e086e14a4fca1ab8aea9765b470e; 4d3d3aec6e526da766f21fd456db6f2ce2833837; eef404ec01ee6bc36e753300cf2b3991b572d6e6; d332080e0a93a88138eb9b89264a83c669492996; 00122ee88031a43c164c9ecbe110a4d16ebbf98f; d3de804b83b54fb08e7c6c261d39901d9d835a97; 56ad22d53bc3b1035fc566486c174c6dfa2fc84d; 67f2acc53f32809c0d1d24f45c538c9531ff5429; 35a0a75c5e7d8b0480821dcf28c9dd03ebb8f8e5; 2f35976152aee0b1afcf8615297d88274d7cf154; 189acf33fe5d51f27b366122e29b603c6f8c6a72; 5128950703d313516f5a789cc567feafc88802cb; 57e7a7323f58a35f5e2cc33bf17d4ac9cdcafdd4; c977337b1658fc8d51dfb32e6f8c581ae51b47a5; f2aa684fedc35fbb0bd93c5c751282417cc9e497; 6519f5a04ffd561676c73f3db0ddb6ffe310bb4d; dff2d50db96831c732253590cb4b89d25f66e5f2; e189a7e235a37fbf0b15df5e62cd78523a7b33e7; 40ad4230c3c69616597f1990c9873a9e10925e0d; bc722dc7431e241a05c731c55915f5d6e34f2b91; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 33f4bd029323f5c8c138f898f67f4a3d02bee96a; 92debc3f3577d1b7f3394f8c35de3360e6cf6713; f34c30f7836233da7277c2f2f2153004a10598a6; 549c9e109c26f50ac50e377952f0e774dd6f5e46; 2c6955900fda91841055326248edb41e566485eb,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,111,"

6d1e4289f5e2b3cf9e0c766d8378d44e568b3fbb,Mapping of hepatic expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in a Han Chinese population,"BACKGROUND
Elucidating the genetic basis underlying hepatic gene expression variability is of importance to understand the aetiology of the disease and variation in drug metabolism. To date, no genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analysis has been conducted in the Han Chinese population, the largest ethnic group in the world.


METHODS
We performed a genome-wide eQTL mapping in a set of Han Chinese liver tissue samples (n=64). The data were then compared with published eQTL data from a Caucasian population. We then performed correlations between these eQTLs with important pharmacogenes, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in particular those identified in the Asian population.


RESULTS
Our analyses identified 1669 significant eQTLs (false discovery rate (FDR) <â€‰0.05). We found that 41% of Asian eQTLs were also eQTLs in Caucasians at the genome-wide significance level (p=10â»â¸). Both cis- and trans-eQTLs in the Asian population were also more likely to be eQTLs in Caucasians (p<10â»â´). Enrichment analyses revealed that trait-associated GWAS-SNPs were enriched within the eQTLs identified in our data, so were the GWAS-SNPs specifically identified in Asian populations in a separate analysis (p<0.001 for both). We also found that hepatic expression of very important pharmacogenetic (VIP) genes (n=44) and a manually curated list of major genes involved in pharmacokinetics (n=341) were both more likely to be controlled by eQTLs (p<0.002 for both).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provided, for the first time, a comprehensive hepatic eQTL analysis in a non-European population, further generating valuable data for characterising the genetic basis of human diseases and pharmacogenetic traits.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""X Wang"", ids = ""50142131""); list(name = ""Hua-mei Tang"", ids = ""153498902""); list(name = ""Mujian Teng"", ids = ""39845707""); list(name = ""Zhiqiang Li"", ids = ""46947237""); list(name = ""Jian-Guo Li"", ids = ""46276858""); list(name = ""Junwei Fan"", ids = ""144958601""); list(name = ""Lin Zhong"", ids = ""1391112023""); list(name = ""Xing-bin Sun"", ids = ""2833370""); list(name = ""Junming Xu"", ids = ""46372728""); list(name = ""Guoqing Chen"", ids = ""150109422""); list(name = ""Da-wei Chen"", ids = ""123204644""); list(name = ""Zhao-wen Wang"", ids = ""47196743""); list(name = ""Tonghai Xing"", ids = ""3633954""); list(name = ""Jin-yan Zhang"", ids = ""8214790""); list(name = ""Lili Huang"", ids = ""47033196""); list(name = ""Shuyun Wang"", ids = ""49185020""); list(name = ""Xiao-ning Peng"", ids = ""36895815""); list(name = ""Shengying Qin"", ids = ""8307614""); list(name = ""Yongyong Shi"", ids = ""153212322""); list(name = ""Zhihai Peng"", ids = ""50037762"")",b536a028d5673adf15d27339ed0f49cec7e54fbc; 753c538a4b5e58c21c9ffb6c3326653ada497e9b; 05e809fc7476012ceef445b8c7768c5451af35e3; 9e0663365ba4a61dccdf21c8e923d8fb589884dc; e96a60227038623e56ce0e832e1d61ed3efdc72e; 3af5c47088c5d3685d6c3118befce6125f0914ef; 066be96d9ad9bd17b156af561889c9144cecdc92; f60af5d0ca6454042d4f653d1770a945febf5d88; 0e596bcf1cdbe8a31a999bf975617ff9ce900c7a; 49c2f26b92e07afcad57d1062efb390e8e713137; 27528e037e33e3affc3fc3a9a6671be13ee52b23; daa75fc11a35da568239b9a35f8e3d375d1222c9,06c9bc46d07e8270033d9f36585eb648da16c18c; edca235863c3bca859e00624983611700c4dd452; 53adfe99b4cc9c2a1a115de2832d9ead672ab94d; 06778d3e840c40cd65d41e5096d3156febcb5311; c0ca80da0a512b35f0b66106d016c9b5080cb95f; 6f3675caf5bcce3ad0f0414de0d19390cb6f14ea; 772c69e2b0fc97c02a693d6c98e51498fd63353c; eef9bafa8f5e772fedd1ae0937b8664f6ffcc102; 11c029501fe312030c0994bbb17c5f250c48a418; 42815b9ebb5f57180ddd16e5d869c7a9b85d9aad; 2ddf77602f3c9e106035e0cc24c20a3784845ab8; 9af732a0026ca1db41d8d79485874e7e8c97be61; b02634d2283e0f95233142b8ec92b7ed8599c692; e5957a8cfd753aa3c9b2de4f870f165fbf4e1463; 0245d00c619dd350dce8440a934ea1d1cb63cf7f; c6fb2f982df0a83dc04187fe9c03ff4d63a63ae0; b0de78af6e83e617d69febc13a0a1bd8127ce88d; 3e753d30b324035bbfcc9f603954320ac6bd360a; a7aa03bd59002735614fcc3b2e677351082b51fb; 975c2b02b9a8d50d2f64ee91b8f00d3cdbf155de; 25059fdcf3d88ba364d53abcdb91415f46549410; 014e00653edf178bd44a220436c4646433482046; 5b6b97bedbd75a8629e186fb7da9a2272a70fe41; de623ec9dbbd4cdb29925dd215cfe0c4399cdb6a; c7a6d4adb77035392b2905a5fea3d569fa4eb726; 7fcabcb1dff389a3c8750c983b1b34753cbce59e; fd837c22787ad6d50be22a66900204ce72804d44; 86ccee4368e22cfc8e3c2bc9264f63f9104ca400; c5df9d82f18fa38704d988e545cd11a3f2b9c23a; 8755a42fa3946cc24d3ac4717c7dc1a7dac93ea7; afa8fe1a6d2dea2769486b87ac571d528fa1e73a; 1be8ed7300926b10836799cc7602637e3ffe48e2; 7acfc228d95bd1e66d70f6a6cf732d9942de87ed; bd708c8324caec9c03232958b232e5cdff5e7bce,Journal of Medical Genetics,51,319 - 326
f43058f9ee4f18c5de6c372225d5184609f42aa0,A semiparametric cluster detection method â€” a comprehensive power comparison with Kulldorff's method,"BackgroundA semiparametric density ratio method which borrows strength from two or more samples can be applied to moving window of variable size in cluster detection. The method requires neither the prior knowledge of the underlying distribution nor the number of cases before scanning. In this paper, the semiparametric cluster detection procedure is combined with Storey's q-value, a type of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) method, to take into account the multiple testing problem induced by the overlapping scanning windows.ResultsIt is shown by simulations that for binary data, using Kulldorff's Northeastern benchmark data, the semiparametric method and Kulldorff's method performs similarly well. When the data are not binary, the semiparametric methodology still works in many cases, but Kulldorff's method requires the choices of a correct probability model, namely the correct scan statistic, in order to achieve comparable power as the semiparametric method achieves. Kulldorff's method with an inappropriate probability model may lose power.ConclusionsThe semiparametric method proposed in the paper can achieve good power when detecting localized cluster. The method does not require a specific distributional assumption other than the tilt function. In addition, it is possible to adapt other scan schemes (e.g., elliptic spatial scan, flexible shape scan) to search for clusters as well.",2009,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shihua Wen"", ids = ""1935972""); list(name = ""Benjamin Kedem"", ids = ""2373604"")",d4e12007436b1c8f6fb092b85cb61ef1227e92dc; 80b7a3065b56356cd093ce35f1d9000ea31352ef; 8aa7c288a39648f38a228de8afe847bec473fd80; 3cedcda4eb0f85a57e776c3128f9b60248770836; 0a9ee2e7c8ee295d356f09a964ced3ac416a2a81; 342cb708fd06d03746ff5bcec900ae65cdcf8d82; 8f825d25e120749b12c07b39db3a4b3332f4bf28,837f1bf1e44d00aeb355856bd1904c60de1cfa4c; cf888d2ccf04d2b8d5e144bdbec14fa4c4895d4e; 0c0001fbddb1cd282e1e7c935154a23d4726c67e; 1674f6f036a8d9c8b9d264683661698e8c53a160; 326f2fc52e391cbdd31edb727f222fec2fabb407; d7f4a5bbe92753bcbb6ed50bf65d3dff8909a887; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; 130709f64a0d1762af9da63cb97975fca198311b; 2aa7b1b038714a6f6bb360c3b520ec34ef12eb9e; 68419f4baf53fb9fbbebaf018bc4c0ea05b95604; dd12a1d8d179a6d2268c99e4e531f1dc1de1f037; 6a04e2b89f940d94a9c47234e31d13ca7820d283; c98b6f36f6a9f1d25c5cbe16a3772dfdcb23e113; 21b6c1b4a61d4d2ecbcdccea88b1e290648c08cf; 114b9807ee608db1c56133bbe4a1f188f195f9e4; 74e558e458e3ecfc33ca2d7dff417940505d43f4; e1f326a48910b182cde9ef988950e6fbd5a04f4c; b3f0a539fd43663f60c28fd0a1afdb95397399c4; 9dac6c7a9f7e560d7e2f12b5f5129d9cc8afad14; 6ade00b8590c3b352b57ef8feec71d5e79f377c3; c2e9a9bd7e5165f3b3003a9bca36771cabf2860c; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; d794fd6e5919248ab399b9c44b0c94e93a570e9d; 821c6660965ab4925d49aebffb40fd831b23a3f6; fed6a94f05ea7d0388a620fe0b822f70e342b92c; fe8dca92115553710761ea1ec1464ed8019cf1f9; 987cb7d1dfee5629ea7e4df0dcf1a1b01e22d76d; 8a0244cfd2e1c12089105a3efc8b8b837aaf740c; ac608000c5ce5b89fcc628e50d1dcff267eaa08b; 88fd99a1fdf03cbc7e5c0b5f25b7e29e0a2dabd8; 29c90f8c80a35cc4c262df71b86ccce3515bbd97; 3350ef8df45d048bc2c64ec98dd8a346bb98e49f; c5d8dd126d8a22f1a8b24c23dc04d75e6caebd71; 1a07f299115e7aa240a30c36f919ff07db85f6e4; 0df63d717912ba0a44b7947104684beb4fb9f8d2; 5b9e2536e25a88ba0d406ddfd7cad7adde993d50; 0870cfa50b9731d32993e4a6d8006fc63c94fec5; 380d5960133eae1ee47140d266e2e21704ee64f8; 9159d787ffe429c1d6831e869c775a88c671041a,International Journal of Health Geographics,8,73 - 73
760017fa957e04f50f1b7589417034a8fe1e2e75,Microarray analysis of Fusarium graminearum-induced wheat genes: identification of organ-specific and differentially expressed genes.,"A wheat cDNA microarray consisting of 5739 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was used to investigate the transcriptome patterns of the glume, lemma, palea, anther, ovary and rachis dissected from infected wheat spikes after inoculation with the fungus Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of fusarium head blight (FHB) disease. Stringent conditions were employed to reduce the false discovery rate. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was used to identify transcripts that showed a differential response between fungal-challenged vs. control plants. To verify the microarray data, Northern blot analysis was carried out on randomly selected up-regulated clones. We observed 185 (3.2%) up-regulated and 16 (0.28%) down-regulated ESTs in the six organs constituting the wheat spike. Many up-regulated ESTs (46.67%) showed no homology with sequences of known functions, whereas others showed homology with genes involved in defence and stress responses, the oxidative burst of H(2)O(2), regulatory functions, protein synthesis and the phenylpropanoid pathway. The monitoring of genes in specific organs avoided the averaging of expression values over multiple organs that occurs when using data from the whole spike.

7c9a3406dc7c906edabbc249d37a90ce694608c0,Controlling mixed directional false discovery rate in multidimensional decisions with applications to microarray studies,"Time-course microarray experiments harvested samples at several time points. To reveal the dynamic gene expression changes over time, we need to identify the significant genes and detect the patterns of gene expressions, which may bring directional errors. Guo et al.Â (Biometrics 66(2):485â€“492, 2010) introduced a mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR) controlled procedure, which controls the sum of expected proportions of Type I and Type III errors among all rejections. In this paper, we develop weighted p value procedures for mdFDR control and give out some sufficient conditions to assure the (asymptotic) mdFDR control. Some weights and their estimators are illustrated to satisfy the sufficient conditions. The proposed weighted p value procedures are compared with the existing method by extensive simulations. Based on the proposed weighted p values procedure, we provide multiple CIs which control the false coverage-statement rate (FCR). We use the proposed methods to analyze the time-course microarray data studied in Lobenhofer et al.Â (Mol Endocrinol 16:1215â€“1229, 2002). Most of our findings are the same as those obtained by the existing method. In addition, we identify some other important genes, such as CDKN3 and NQO1.",2018,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Haibing Zhao"", ids = ""37950585""); list(name = ""Wing K.

4ffb5cc6422057c14004df0e157be4e0f7c4f854,"Functional Connectivity of Attention, Visual, and Language Networks During Audio, Illustrated, and Animated Stories in Preschool-Age Children","The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents read with their children early and often, and limits on screen-based media. While book sharing may benefit attention in children, effects of animated content are controversial, and the influence of either on attention networks has not previously been studied. This study involved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of three separate active-task scans composed of similar, 5-minute stories presented in the same order for each child (audio ïƒ  illustrated ïƒ  animated), followed by assessment of comprehension. Five functional brain networks were defined a priori via literature review: dorsal attention (DAN), ventral attention (VAN), language (L), visual imagery (VI) and visual perception (VP). Analyses involved comparison of functional connectivity (FC) within- and between-networks across formats, applying false discovery rate correction. Twenty-seven of 33 children completed fMRI (82%; 15 boys, 12 girls; mean 58 Â± 8 months old). Comprehension of audio and illustrated stories was equivalent, and lower for animation (p<0.05). For illustration relative to audio, FC within DAN and VAN and between each of these and all other networks was similar, lower within-L, and higher between VI-VP, suggesting reduced strain on the language network via illustrations and imagery. For animation relative to illustration, FC was lower between DAN-L, VAN-VP, VAN-VI, L-VI, and L-VP, suggesting less focus on narrative, reorienting to imagery and visual-language integration. These findings suggest that illustrated storybooks may be optimal at this age to encourage integration of attention, visual, and language networks, while animation may bias attention towards visual perception.",2019,Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""John S.

226ee90d2ab28195ebe4b6f09c17391ff481f0a3,Variation of Gut Mucosal Microbiome With Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae Antibody Status in Pediatric Crohn Disease.,"OBJECTIVES
Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing condition possibly caused by a dysbiotic microbiome. Approximately 30% to 60% of patients with CD have anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA), but any association with gut microbiota is unexplored. We hypothesized that ASCA positivity would predict a signature microbial status and clinical phenotype.


METHODS
Ileocolonic mucosal biopsies were obtained from children with CD (nâ€Š=â€Š135), and controls without inflammatory bowel disease (nâ€Š=â€Š45). Comparison was made between ASCA status, microbial diversity, and clinical characteristics.


RESULTS
ASCA was highly specific but poorly sensitive for the diagnosis of CD. In patients with CD, ASCA positivity was associated with older age (â‰¥10 years), ileocolonic disease, and long-term risk of surgery. Microbial alpha and beta diversity were similar in patients with CD with or without ASCA, but significantly less when compared to noninflammatory bowel disease controls. Microbial richness was similar across all 3 groups. Fourteen bacterial species were associated with ASCA-positive patients with CD and 14 species with ASCA-negative patients (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05). After using a false discovery rate correction Ruminococcus torques and bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica 61 remained significantly associated with CD ASCA positivity (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.0178), whereas Enterobacter cloacae and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly associated with CD ASCA negativity (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.0178 and 0.0342).


CONCLUSION
ASCA-positive and ASCA-negative patients with CD have significant differences in gut microbiome composition, which could possibly be influencing the phenotype of the disease.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Shivani Kansal"", ids = ""48710778""); list(name = ""Anthony G Catto-Smith"", ids = ""1416698225""); list(name = ""Karen Boniface"", ids = ""39621983""); list(name = ""Sarah Thomas"", ids = ""51071632""); list(name = ""Donald J Cameron"", ids = ""117266258""); list(name = ""Mark R.

a98392315fb1070e506a80b92854ba1957bfe64b,Plasma Metabolomics in Human Pulmonary Tuberculosis Disease: A Pilot Study,"We aimed to characterize metabolites during tuberculosis (TB) disease and identify new pathophysiologic pathways involved in infection as well as biomarkers of TB onset, progression and resolution. Such data may inform development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. Plasma samples from adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB disease and their matched, asymptomatic, sputum culture-negative household contacts were analyzed using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify metabolites. Statistical and bioinformatics methods were used to select accurate mass/charge (m/z) ions that were significantly different between the two groups at a false discovery rate (FDR) of q<0.05. Two-way hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to identify clusters of ions contributing to separation of cases and controls, and metabolomics databases were used to match these ions to known metabolites. Identity of specific D-series resolvins, glutamate and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-derived trehalose-6-mycolate was confirmed using LC-MS/MS analysis. Over 23,000 metabolites were detected in untargeted metabolomic analysis and 61 metabolites were significantly different between the two groups. HCA revealed 8 metabolite clusters containing metabolites largely upregulated in patients with TB disease, including anti-TB drugs, glutamate, choline derivatives, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived cell wall glycolipids (trehalose-6-mycolate and phosphatidylinositol) and pro-resolving lipid mediators of inflammation, known to stimulate resolution, efferocytosis and microbial killing. The resolvins were confirmed to be RvD1, aspirin-triggered RvD1, and RvD2. This study shows that high-resolution metabolomic analysis can differentiate patients with active TB disease from their asymptomatic household contacts. Specific metabolites upregulated in the plasma of patients with active TB disease, including Mtb-derived glycolipids and resolvins, have potential as biomarkers and may reveal pathways involved in TB disease pathogenesis and resolution.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jennifer K Frediani"", ids = ""6452049""); list(name = ""Dean P.

77e09a3eb091c4dcdba07881e18ebdb05bc4cbc4,A Power and Prediction Analysis for Knockoffs with Lasso Statistics,"Knockoffs is a new framework for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing problems involving complex statistical models. While there has been great emphasis on Type-I error control, Type-II errors have been far less studied. In this paper we analyze the false negative rate or, equivalently, the power of a knockoff procedure associated with the Lasso solution path under an i.i.d. Gaussian design, and find that knockoffs asymptotically achieve close to optimal power with respect to an omniscient oracle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for sparse signals, performing model selection via knockoff filtering achieves nearly ideal prediction errors as compared to a Lasso oracle equipped with full knowledge of the distribution of the unknown regression coefficients. The i.i.d. Gaussian design is adopted to leverage results concerning the empirical distribution of the Lasso estimates, which makes power calculation possible for both knockoff and oracle procedures.",2017,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Asaf Weinstein"", ids = ""25462138""); list(name = ""Rina Foygel Barber"", ids = ""32492090""); list(name = ""Emmanuel J.

230abea0dff5df4603fe229d5a114b65b3345ff1,Multiple trait multiple interval mapping of quantitative trait loci from inbred line crosses,"BackgroundAlthough many experiments have measurements on multiple traits, most studies performed the analysis of mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for each trait separately using single trait analysis. Single trait analysis does not take advantage of possible genetic and environmental correlations between traits. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical method for multiple trait multiple interval mapping (MTMIM) of QTL for inbred line crosses. We also develop a novel score-based method for estimating genome-wide significance level of putative QTL effects suitable for the MTMIM model. The MTMIM method is implemented in the freely available and widely used Windows QTL Cartographer software.ResultsThroughout the paper, we provide compelling empirical evidences that: (1) the score-based threshold maintains proper type I error rate and tends to keep false discovery rate within an acceptable level; (2) the MTMIM method can deliver better parameter estimates and power than single trait multiple interval mapping method; (3) an analysis of Drosophila dataset illustrates how the MTMIM method can better extract information from datasets with measurements in multiple traits.ConclusionsThe MTMIM method represents a convenient statistical framework to test hypotheses of pleiotropic QTL versus closely linked nonpleiotropic QTL, QTL by environment interaction, and to estimate the total genotypic variance-covariance matrix between traits and to decompose it in terms of QTL-specific variance-covariance matrices, therefore, providing more details on the genetic architecture of complex traits.",2012,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Luciano Da Costa E Silva"", ids = ""39809718""); list(name = ""Shengchu Wang"", ids = ""50695536""); list(name = ""Zhao-Bang Zeng"", ids = ""33856320"")",8718c39bbdcaf9cbaef03bcf718333ad79786cab; 30bff018dc16840c451ed1aa42d220dfe2e52f37; e1fc855d5760b4cb93491f37feeeaf7a3a01280d; 3a9c2afd9c334d88452950697a3993614b12a1b8; 79524ea80f818e173f4e0f4bbd25742083ebbbfd; 5b2b36ee85aa0b5f85e4f667422a3e05350a02fe; d9c1b9157770774dcf5875de46487af757fc6e49; 68ef9f7ba6f5ac8f76b954548f72734a3865e1d2; b033ab1b63f42b771e05441d64d1c8d00d7f87ae; 94e591d4b1f4ff0397c4190cc4da4deaa12978db; 246690f0db0f2a7bb24590124ebfbe2d24787beb; d444964fc132277296333fe7e819866200c5f724; 1dd43fcb97ef63b47aa20f9175f282029ef391de; 85889caed404f81db6f37495ec98b88160e6e57b; 7dbb5da08df4874d9c8f36cac94a4bd8d373747c; d025d9a7a0ed4b7537e1890001899ab09eed2dc0; 6bfea7c39114903b25ed05db3b6bf833d5dec13e; e1d540372ba5ab71d98ae92df60e73aaf21c2cdd; 1ebc9f3b6f730d7d7a9b26ba6f56d216bbf51ac8,34be4b63d241a307a0e7fd0e14e3b389d35e392f; 721b25ffad2623a8d1e8044882f66e0dbe678f1d; b10b4d611b2b4f77fe9ae9d24dbdfa8da27326a3; 9cb9761818d777472c8fd3e979186936c731752b; 2dfc598e231bb43e7dd702c00835e78c7f279efc; 294dfa22a3f0d1569f6973d7d2f6c98dcf8b6e74; 149b515573aa61950f0ba01042777b9ac216f9b8; 40c573b3fb9eddcdc54ba2a42603ab3a2889a225; bdfb57141b2141095ed942b28be24808aeba8d54; 6abf58aceafe7546f789f6217ea1da4e03103b65; 3b71b4446cb47c97c98710140185c940bc50a8c5; e241bcb926cf2bcbf594522733b5e72da40c9e45; 9072014901683d8325668dad0112644112034690; 0b3995e33daf8fea7a772585ff7dac925af7fae9; 702773e40133afd0f967edd333f36f51ace23f6c; 860b394332d58aa65bf977f25b66438c856a8166; f6dddac967e3347d0cb1b48fec50b5999102fe44; 8aa7571820735e1c45e16781120878ec36d6994d; 625732166d5a9979f0db363c99b47e0bb2ac44bb; 3b33d466619863e33b889b7074002605e1d93623; a880ff247a5b5f697058f838b6638b3a6ed6fee2; e5d74cf3969d2f40db74f986a884b1b2b183a739; 06e15a6da368a59171fe7b9e3260884cfe7a208c; d714b74329f696d80b14084f15f486942febce68; b5a43be337711cf90814c140b2431386c71cda29; 5bf42d15470cd5d5fe5552b1bf42cfba2dc80921; e799443b40eaf4d3912d6910e2941c325e1b9d29; 5da091c1d437a74fc4126f14047be4ea1dd0e9fe; 2a085456534184c18d98a6b86d237df5fa150598; a3b5114168359e4a652743657d2b6642552495bd; 01818509fd55ce907e1c80ba8eb84524871180c5; 52ce8bd94791fc78c101fbf932d4a993c0c7cbfe; 5fc275f5f66c047bc478f26a33577e89c98818de; 688ee8894447e30f60e2f438f17eb01b00ecddf0; 7d50991b693fc23edda316fb1487f114f6cc6706; 17228a0f580480191c3003289d7c910154370f8e; e3d531fcf4ef7815e41958293ee7734428610a0a; 0b974f02762f987b7a3e8ff7f17fb6da8c4467c7; 7168b17d2be39e27f8078fc016b146cb32806194; 96be493d2d823b6531579f2bb48ea766db0f5897,BMC Genetics,13,67 - 67
a4f9b182dc47ea3942f23ec3c0981fd38ade60ee,A Genome Wide Association Study for Longevity in Cattle,"Longevity is regarded as the most important functional 
trait in cattle breeding with high economic value yet low heritability. In 
order to identify genomic regions associated with longevity, a genome wise 
association study was performed using data from 4887 Fleckvieh bulls and 33,556 
SNPs after quality control. Single SNP regression was used for identification 
of important SNPs including eigenvectors as a means of 
correction for population structure. SNPs selected with a false discovery rate 
threshold of 0.05 and with local false discovery rate identified genomic 
regions associated with longevity which were subsequently cross checked with 
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. This, to 
identify interesting genes in cattle and their homologue forms in other 
species. The most notable genes were SYT10 located on chromosome 5, ADAMTS3 on 
chromosome 6, NTRK2 on chromosome 8 and SNTG1 on chromosome 14 of the cattle 
genome. Several of the genes found have previously been associated with cattle

041904fe9468e90e3939729c46ffb7866791e035,Animal Health: Dairy calves and heifers,"Movement of beef calves from a pasture to a housing environment induces a stress response including changes in leukocyte physiology. Understanding the molecular profiles underlying these changes can help to develop better management practices and treatments to minimize the deleterious effects of stress. The objective of this study is to characterize the leukocytes transcriptome changes during housing stress after moving claves from outdoor to indoor environments. Transcriptome of blood leukocytes from 6 beef calves in outdoor pasture (d 0) was compared with that of d 1, 2 and 7 after being moved indoors. Individual calf RNA-seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq analyzer platform. Single-end reads were mapped to the Bos taurus reference genome (UCSC_bosTau7) using Tophat v2.0.12. In total, 26,163 isoform transcripts pertaining to 8,606 genes were identified and 1,636 isoform transcripts pertaining to 1,320 genes were differentially expressed at d 1, d 2 and d 7 relative to d 0 (False Discovery Rate-adjusted P-value <0.05) using Cufflinks v2.2.1. The number of differentially expressed genes increased with time indoors: d 0 vs d 1 (32 genes), d 0 vs d 2 (434 genes), and d 0 vs d 7 (1170 genes). Among the top 50 differentially abundant transcripts CCAAT/enhancer binding protein C/EBP epsilon (CEBPE) and Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) were overexpressed in leukocytes collected on d 1, d 2, and d 7, relative to d 0. DUSP1 plays a role in the cellular response to environmental stress, and CEBPE is essential for terminal differentiation and functional maturation of leukocyte cells. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes using DAVID identified 8 enriched functional category clusters pertaining to Biological Processes, Molecular functions and KEGG Pathways (Enrichment score >2): protein synthesis and transport, cell regulation and reorganization, RNA transport, leukocyte activation, proliferation and differentiation. These categories confirm that housing stress elicits changes in the leukocyte transcriptome associated with inflammatory response. The permanency of these changes and the impact on inflammatory response to other stress sources including infection and management requires further evaluation.",2015,,"list(name = ""Mary Anita"", ids = ""145149075""); list(name = ""Snell"", ids = ""117077850""); list(name = ""Jason P.

To pool MRI data acquired under these changed conditions, it is necessary to demonstrate that the changes do not affect MRI-based measurements. In these circumstances, classical inference testing is inappropriate because it is designed to detect differences, not prove similarity. We used a method known as statistical equivalence testing to address this limitation. Equivalence testing was carried out on 3 datasets: (1) cortical thickness and automated hippocampal volume estimates obtained from healthy individuals imaged using different multichannel head coils; (2) manual hippocampal volumetry obtained using two readers; and (3) corpus callosum area estimates obtained using an automated method with manual cleanup carried out by two readers. Equivalence testing was carried out using the ""two one-sided tests"" (TOST) approach. Power analyses of the TOST were used to estimate sample sizes required for well-powered equivalence testing analyses. Mean and standard deviation estimates from the automated hippocampal volume dataset were used to carry out an example power analysis. Cortical thickness values were found to be equivalent over 61% of the cortex when different head coils were used (q < .05, false discovery rate correction). Automated hippocampal volume estimates obtained using the same two coils were statistically equivalent (TOST P = 4.28 Ã— 10(-15) ). Manual hippocampal volume estimates obtained using two readers were not statistically equivalent (TOST P = .97). The use of different readers to carry out limited correction of automated corpus callosum segmentations yielded equivalent area estimates (TOST P = 1.28 Ã— 10(-14) ). Power analysis of simulated and automated hippocampal volume data demonstrated that the equivalence margin affects the number of subjects required for well-powered equivalence tests. We have presented a statistical method for determining if morphometric measures obtained under variable conditions can be pooled. The equivalence testing technique is applicable for analyses in which experimental conditions vary over the course of the study.",2016,Medicine,"list(name = ""Heath R.

30ea21fcdf4db937ea241e019641375919bcb8c3,MEF2 as upstream regulator of the transcriptome signature in human skeletal muscle during unloading.,"Our understanding of skeletal muscle structural and functional alterations during unloading has increased in recent decades, yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning these changes have only started to be unraveled. The purpose of the current investigation was to assess changes in skeletal muscle gene expression after 21 days of bed rest, with a particular focus on predicting upstream regulators of muscle disuse. Additionally, the association between differential microRNA expression and the transcriptome signature of bed rest were investigated. mRNAs from musculus vastus lateralis biopsies obtained from 12 men before and after the bed rest were analyzed using a microarray. There were 54 significantly upregulated probesets after bed rest, whereas 103 probesets were downregulated (false discovery rate 10%; fold-change cutoff â‰¥1.5). Among the upregulated genes, transcripts related to denervation-induced alterations in skeletal muscle were identified, e.g., acetylcholine receptor subunit delta and perinatal myosin. The most downregulated transcripts were functionally enriched for mitochondrial genes and genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, followed by a large number of contractile fiber components. Upstream regulator analysis identified a robust inhibition of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family, in particular MEF2C, which was suggested to act upstream of several key downregulated genes, most notably peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator 1-Î± (PGC-1Î±)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and CRSP3. Only a few microRNAs were identified as playing a role in the overall transcriptome picture induced by sustained bed rest. Our results suggest that the MEF2 family is a key regulator underlying the transcriptional signature of bed rest and, hence, ultimately also skeletal muscle alterations induced by systemic unloading in humans.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Eric Rullman"", ids = ""3609760""); list(name = ""R Fernandez-Gonzalo"", ids = ""1398913585""); list(name = ""Igor B.

767c1f61ea7041dad981e5d99345b29161e56f93,Correlating Bladder Cancer Risk Genes with Their Targeting MicroRNAs Using MMiRNA-Tar,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (http://cancergenome.nih.gov) is a valuable data resource focused on an increasing number of well-characterized cancer genomes. In part, TCGA provides detailed information about cancer-dependent gene expression changes, including changes in the expression of transcription-regulating microRNAs. We developed a web interface tool MMiRNA-Tar (http://bioinf1.indstate.edu/MMiRNA-Tar) that can calculate and plot the correlation of expression for mRNA-microRNA pairs across samples or over a time course for a list of pairs under different prediction confidence cutoff criteria. Prediction confidence was established by requiring that the proposed mRNA-microRNA pair appears in at least one of three target prediction databases: TargetProfiler, TargetScan, or miRanda. We have tested our MMiRNA-Tar tool through analyzing 53 tumor and 11 normal samples of bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) datasets obtained from TCGA and identified 204 microRNAs. These microRNAs were correlated with the mRNAs of five previously-reported bladder cancer risk genes and these selected pairs exhibited correlations in opposite direction between the tumor and normal samples based on the customized cutoff criterion of prediction. Furthermore, we have identified additional 496 genes (830 pairs) potentially targeted by 79 significant microRNAs out of 204 using three cutoff criteria, i.e., false discovery rate (FDR)<0.1, opposite correlation coefficient between the tumor and normal samples, and predicted by at least one of three target prediction databases. Therefore, MMiRNA-Tar provides researchers a convenient tool to visualize the co-relationship between microRNAs and mRNAs and to predict their targeting relationship. We believe that correlating expression profiles for microRNAs and mRNAs offers a complementary approach for elucidating their interactions.",2015,Biology; Medicine; Computer Science,"list(name = ""Yang P.

Many genetic susceptibility loci are shared with other autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases that also cosegregate in families with T1D. The aim of this study was to investigate whether susceptibility loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T1D were also associated with autoantibody positivity in individuals with diabetes. Fifty single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 6,556 multiethnic cases collected by the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC). These were tested for association with three islet autoantibodies-against autoantibodies to GAD (GADA), IA-2 (IA-2A), and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A)-and autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOA) in autoimmune thyroid disease, gastric parietal cells (PCA) in autoimmune gastritis, transglutaminase (TGA) in celiac disease, and 21-hydroxylase (21-OHA) in autoimmune hypoadrenalism.

It was found that a total of 40 miRNAs had similar expression level in all the three cells [false discovery rate (FDR)=0, fold change <3.0]. Moreover, q-PCR showed that some members of miR-106b and miR-17-92 families were expressed in the ESC, NSC induced from ESC (ESC-NSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bioinformatical analysis showed that 'stemness genes' (p21/CDKN1A, p57/CDKN1C and PTEN) were putative targets of miR-106b and miR-17-92 families. A total of 95 miRNAs were found to experience significant change (FDR=0, fold change >5.0) when the ESC differentiated into NSC. On the basis of miRNA, mRNA expression variance and predicted target genes of miRNA, we formulated a bioinformatical model for miRNA control of ESC-NSC differentiation. Then, the miRNA expression pattern was compared between NSC obtained in vitro and in vivo, and it was found that only 8% of miRNAs were different between the two NSCs. This study suggested that miR-106b and miR-17-92 families may promote the renewal of stem cells by targeting PTEN, p21/CDKN1A and p57/CDKN1C. Some miRNAs may play a key role in gene re-programming during ESC-NSC differentiation, and a substantial homogeneity exists between NSCs derived in vitro and those in vivo.",2010,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Hong Chen"", ids = ""49177930""); list(name = ""Kun Qian"", ids = ""143857302""); list(name = ""Z.

2cdb934f0bcb6105340cd55ff1795cac1b69ecfc,Longitudinal analysis of epigenome-wide DNA methylation reveals novel smoking-related loci in African Americans.,"Changes in DNA methylation may be a potential mechanism that mediates the effects of smoking on physiological function and subsequent disease risk. Given the dynamic nature of the epigenome, longitudinal studies are indispensable for investigating smoking-induced methylation changes over time. Using blood samples collected approximately five years apart in 380 African Americans (mean age 60.7Â years) from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study, we measured DNA methylation levels using Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChips. We evaluated the association between Phase 1 smoking status and rate of methylation change, using generalized estimating equation models. Among the 6958 CpG sites examined, smoking status was associated with methylation change for 22 CpGs (false discovery rate q <Â 0.1), with the majority (91%) becoming less methylated over time. Methylation change was greater in ever smokers than never smokers, and the absolute differences in rates of change ranged from 0.18 to 0.77 per decade in M value, equivalent to a Î² value change of 0.013 to 0.047 per decade. Significant enrichment was observed for CpG islands, enhancers, and DNAse hypersensitivity sites (pÂ <Â 0.05). Although biological pathway analyses were not significant, most of the 22 CpGs were within genes known to be associated with cardiovascular disease, cancers, and aging. In conclusion, we identified epigenetic signatures for cigarette smoking that may have been missed in cross-sectional analyses, providing insight into the epigenetic effect of smoking and highlighting the importance of longitudinal analysis in understanding the dynamic human epigenome.",2019,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Jiaxuan Liu"", ids = ""46699993""); list(name = ""Wei Zhao"", ids = ""38480589""); list(name = ""Farah Ammous"", ids = ""5700390""); list(name = ""Stephen T.

6c8e0eb8bb6152d9931a6aa2b5a78316b68529b0,PairedFB: a full hierarchical Bayesian model for paired RNAâ€seq data with heterogeneous treatment effects,"Motivation: Several methods have been proposed for the paired RNAâ€seq analysis. However, many of them do not consider the heterogeneity in treatment effect among pairs that can naturally arise in real data. In addition, it has been reported in literature that the false discovery rate (FDR) control of some popular methods has been problematic. In this paper, we present a full hierarchical Bayesian model for the paired RNAâ€seq count data that accounts for variation of treatment effects among pairs and controls the FDR through the posterior expected FDR. Results: Our simulation studies show that most competing methods can have highly inflated FDR for small to moderate sample sizes while PairedFB is able to control FDR close to the nominal levels. Furthermore, PairedFB has overall better performance in ranking true differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on the top than others, especially when the sample size gets bigger or when the heterogeneity level of treatment effects is high. In addition, PairedFB can be applied to identify the biologically significant DEGs with controlled FDR. The real data analysis also indicates PairedFB tends to find more biologically relevant genes even when the sample size is small. PairedFB is also shown to be robust with respect to the model misspecification in terms of its relative performance compared to others.

ed1a47384330fa8f306b849a35bfd5e21c7c9ad8,Information Loss and Power Distortion from Standardizing in Multiple Hypothesis Testing,"Standardization has been a widely adopted practice in multiple testing, for it takes into account the variability in sampling and makes the test statistics comparable across different study units. However, there can be a significant loss in information from basing hypothesis tests on standardized statistics rather than the full data. We develop a new class of heteroscedasticity--adjusted ranking and thresholding (HART) rules that aim to improve existing methods by simultaneously exploiting commonalities and adjusting heterogeneities among the study units. The main idea of HART is to bypass standardization by directly incorporating both the summary statistic and its variance into the testing procedure. A key message is that the variance structure of the alternative distribution, which is subsumed under standardized statistics, is highly informative and can be exploited to achieve higher power. The proposed HART procedure is shown to be asymptotically valid and optimal for false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our simulation demonstrates that HART achieves substantial power gain over existing methods at the same FDR level.

Most competing parametric methods that have appeared in the literature are obtained as special cases or by minor modification of the proposed model. Approximate maximum likelihood fitting is accomplished via a fast and scalable algorithm, which we call LEMMA (Laplace approximated EM Microarray Analysis). The posterior odds of treatment $\times$ gene interactions, derived from the model, involve shrinkage estimates of both the interactions and of the gene specific error variances. Genes are classified as being associated with treatment based on the posterior odds and the local false discovery rate (f.d.r.) with a fixed cutoff. Our model-based approach also allows one to declare the non-null status of a gene by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). It is shown in a detailed simulation study that the approach outperforms well-known competitors. We also apply the proposed methodology to two previously analyzed microarray examples.

cc0eb6d768a82818499396010530d47a7db8caa4,"Whole Grain Products, Fish and Bilberries Alter Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in a Randomized, Controlled Trial: The Sysdimet Study","BACKGROUND
Due to the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, new dietary solutions are needed to help improve glucose and lipid metabolism in persons at high risk of developing the disease. Herein we investigated the effects of low-insulin-response grain products, fatty fish, and berries on glucose metabolism and plasma lipidomic profiles in persons with impaired glucose metabolism.


METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Altogether 106 men and women with impaired glucose metabolism and with at least two other features of the metabolic syndrome were included in a 12-week parallel dietary intervention. The participants were randomized into three diet intervention groups: (1) whole grain and low postprandial insulin response grain products, fatty fish three times a week, and bilberries three portions per day (HealthyDiet group), (2) Whole grain enriched diet (WGED) group, which includes principally the same grain products as group (1), but with no change in fish or berry consumption, and (3) refined wheat breads (Control). Oral glucose tolerance, plasma fatty acids and lipidomic profiles were measured before and after the intervention. Self-reported compliance with the diets was good and the body weight remained constant. Within the HealthyDiet group two hour glucose concentration and area-under-the-curve for glucose decreased and plasma proportion of (n-3) long-chain PUFAs increased (False Discovery Rate p-values <0.05). Increases in eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid associated curvilinearly with the improved insulin secretion and glucose disposal. Among the 364 characterized lipids, 25 changed significantly in the HealthyDiet group, including multiple triglycerides incorporating the long chain (n-3) PUFA.


CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE
The results suggest that the diet rich in whole grain and low insulin response grain products, bilberries, and fatty fish improve glucose metabolism and alter the lipidomic profile. Therefore, such a diet may have a beneficial effect in the efforts to prevent type 2 diabetes in high risk persons.

However, little is known regarding the genetic basis of variation in protein levels of human CSF. We examined CSF levels of 1,126 proteins in 133 subjects and performed a genome-wide association analysis of 514,227 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). To be conservative, Spearman's correlation was used to identify an association between genotypes of SNPs and protein levels. A total of 421 cis and 25 trans SNP-protein pairs were significantly correlated at a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01 (nominal Pâ€‰<â€‰7.66 Ã— 10-9). Cis-only analysis revealed additional 580 SNP-protein pairs with FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01 (nominal Pâ€‰<â€‰2.13 Ã— 10-5). pQTL SNPs were more likely, compared to non-pQTL SNPs, to be a disease/trait-associated variants identified by previous genome-wide association studies.

180b0ab8984c7b2367d682384916eb0468789f6d,False discovery rate control for high dimensional networks of quantile associations conditioning on covariates.,"Motivated by gene coexpression pattern analysis, we propose a novel sample quantile contingency (SQUAC) statistic to infer quantile associations conditioning on covariates. It features enhanced flexibility in handling variables with both arbitrary distributions and complex association patterns conditioning on covariates. We first derive its asymptotic null distribution, and then develop a multiple-testing procedure based on the SQUAC statistic to test simultaneously the independence between one pair of variables conditioning on covariates for all p(p-1)/2 pairs. Here, p is the length of the outcomes and could exceed the sample size. The testing procedure does not require resampling or perturbation and thus is computationally efficient. We prove by theory and numerical experiments that this testing method asymptotically controls the false discovery rate. It outperforms all alternative methods when the complex association patterns exist. Applied to a gastric cancer data set, this testing method successfully inferred the gene coexpression networks of early and late stage patients. It identified more changes in the networks which are associated with cancer survivals. We extend our method to the case that both the length of the outcomes and the length of covariates exceed the sample size, and show that the asymptotic theory still holds.",2018,Mathematics; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jichun Xie"", ids = ""4999927""); list(name = ""Ruosha Li"", ids = ""2116694"")",,152e81272eeb805186def17ceaadcbeeb9428024; 0c675253469117d0c94429e3256efa99adf98817; cfc5ec7a4d3d74e8b9e2eda75c7baea4966609f5; 571673d4ea2a19634ab9984d48d2c82db94137bf; 8c050fe179f709922e7becfe7af435c2ef31eed8; 45c235ec66d222339e3a652aebc9e2aadb4419e8; ff6fb23f09e0ec48ccc482197b1956c233a34e15; ce9b9680a126fdd2e697ad4277d790c87dea974e; afda24168cadc99eaaa2a3236ce704f52b44092d; 8ffd1386df30f3dbdd805e748e2cba93c2817919; f89305e8a83532e86d1febcc9ab4dcfcf9d99cc4; 58daa2677517f38561038cd2d2f92ade8568f8fa; f8d141f258e92fe25f17dd812cce535dc099265c; 0c74bf75d90da6d0a72072d6df4b8378f9db72fb; 5b41336b39c6394adec2ce0e7600f320dd792598; 00e1285bc7ae6b9b4102b13f2377f648db3eb97c; 518b46352a40d4c8912273e9907b3085f713caf9; fcef2258a963f3d3984a486185ddc4349c43aa35; c4fda00b0abee9b9a18383fcaa36bdcc19d9e39d; 5333f00d0933a15a37ddba48334f8ab678a74d7c; 47eee92962de5244d2af24adb90eb184a2bd8470; 048da67bed0e86369bdab91c7e382bf44d317334; 4dbf5f918a9a2949d4c74868bb8fe68a8d653836; 16f62e03450ff7e16d5ac434411bfac5b339599e; 687afa4300a6340009886c8e71165ce0199b86c1; 632863758d7744df13ec58f9830da8539807451f; 62d1101fc12bee5ad8ab1c9640f05fab4abcd67c; 54e965124658592ed1e9dd0645e49cfd1ead2951; 16451c8cbf3827088743806f1c0a3bf81456edba; ec8385a4bd6576a9aed14e3db86a53d0b5674981; cb3efcd5de509f156420976977187a6311d12b6c; 646b0068fa028a6a398b0495aad1f5efaeca5bd9; d33627aed196d8645d85c1dd1b6b85e2a113dd3a; dde66a7180d6ffda2079b4695cd4aa5f8d0bfcc4,"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

7ca3f259e7be6afde99f7203e5279a11ed0424f0,A mixed model reduces spurious genetic associations produced by population stratification in genome-wide association studies.,"Population stratification can produce spurious genetic associations in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Mixed model methodology has been regarded useful for correcting population stratification. This study explored statistical power and false discovery rate (FDR) with the data simulated for dichotomous traits. Empirical FDRs and powers were estimated using fixed models with and without genomic control and using mixed models with and without reflecting loci linked to the candidate marker in genetic relationships. Population stratification with admixture degree ranged from 1% to 10% resulted in inflated FDRs from the fixed model analysis without genomic control and decreased power from the fixed model analysis with genomic control (P<0.05). Meanwhile, population stratification could not change FDR and power estimates from the mixed model analyses (P>0.05). We suggest that the mixed model methodology was useful to reduce spurious genetic associations produced by population stratification in GWAS, even with a high degree of admixture (10%).",2015,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Jimin Shin"", ids = ""8247921""); list(name = ""Chaeyoung Lee"", ids = ""153897623"")",15ca66479c7af54f2ed1ff8e5fa4c8c367bd2534; a41915133c78ee796ef62319feac053e449b29eb; 4cdc3f3504aaf8d5aacc2964c16620632a3faade; 31ed3c68c52758797a621bf798cda8f0ed7c71ec; 3adf829d4810445e9c51be30e4a7a3548ac776d5; 9efbd5de1105727b6d50b351df4c7ee25364d83b; aa46081facbc7a11c56e5e621186057656d6c0a2; c92851c2c1a8f68a118d65ec924b80906ba5ea9e; 46db5031b05f4c986fcbf4772a081ed85e2b5233; f448bc5eb74daaff5d6310e6db42ffe3399c9e5b; 6af31b144922f76294a79035e1912628aad4c245; 1eb1d9e09a7bd5f54199d3d1d335033ea6e761ba; 3feee126ccb17f7cd133dd1555f63e04fe0e47ec; 9cc2d3ca70ccc51b3365bc1f7617cb4a589924ec; 4d0e6309347e72663ad8b0bc8e96e460eef3df9c; 552696f8405c4fdfe983a6a1eb2cf1585260fec2; 6787f814e5a1a6d9711e96cfc45a9c51eec41461; 949f3be360b5ad41432362cb352dc4fc7f75398f,e22ef7f8e305ec275e33b7c26a74e45caec66596; dc1f19525fd22f100e40a12cb97ae326198dfccd; c850813fe8d6249806ead14f7fcad21e7932f21d; f8bd430f43c2c9e0c57afcd8d90832efeba62129; b2734acc3208328878f835e092b6f445b9f7de3e; 7deb84191e9fc80101739718dbe9da916bd9d314; 525048385f9a740829936ece49f9f75695d7e547; 44936b1253177be1e3774c0cae3cc1ee3634c3e5; fbbdc2e73d4d49f42686b414473a9c876a33d875; ff3c4f5ab1a595f891313bcde2e9220ce46153e3; 7ec7e24dd4025819ae386a9ae016465f8d5076d1; 67f0c08c3feda466de28a74f68ac5bf6600fd039; 9d1fc4e31f59310e48532932f6ddea424b3ec986; 36d7d5c7cf44089ca04df441105e57bd7f29afd2; 6241d9ac2a24852e592a63cc7023017ffe73390c; 0967c6c7eeab889f526ba787e3d65509bc308af1; d38266031970dcb8a336ec4c6f095bd01e1a2d16; 565949a972d45ff78f810e1155f44dcfb002816c; 599dceeed1c8178a1da7d608db803488d6a467dc; 55354ab4071212b9acc34fcadb9ba2749b87620a; b0a8003939b352cae26ce97d235881c213915093,Genomics,105 4,"

4edb919d2822f4a1badecee89d8f6c01f52ab23c,Fast and covariate-adaptive method amplifies detection power in large-scale multiple hypothesis testing,"Multiple hypothesis testing is an essential component of modern data science. In many settings, in addition to the p-value, additional covariates for each hypothesis are available, e.g., functional annotation of variants in genome-wide association studies. Such information is ignored by popular multiple testing approaches such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (BH). Here we introduce AdaFDR, a fast and flexible method that adaptively learns the optimal p-value threshold from covariates to significantly improve detection power. On eQTL analysis of the GTEx data, AdaFDR discovers 32% more associations than BH at the same false discovery rate. We prove that AdaFDR controls false discovery proportion and show that it makes substantially more discoveries while controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in extensive experiments. AdaFDR is computationally efficient and allows multi-dimensional covariates with both numeric and categorical values, making it broadly useful across many applications. Side information in addition to the p-values is often available in modern applications of multiple hypothesis testing. Here, the authors develop AdaFDR, a new statistical method for multiple hypothesis testing that adaptively learns the decision threshold and amplifies the discovery power.",2019,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Martin J.

558e28786f35dbc5bbc7f053a8a71c4c1e5936fa,A quantitative comparison of PSIR and MP-RAGE at 7 T using tissue classification,"Purpose. Phase Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR) is showing great potential in neuroimaging [1] due to the increased contrast it provides with respect to other T1 weighted approaches, such as standard MP-RAGE. In a typical PSIR acquisition, two images are collected during a single inversion recovery and the phase images are used to restore the sign of the inversion recovery signal in the magnitude images, thereby doubling the dynamic range in the reconstructed image. In turn, this increase in range can be exploited by increasing image resolution, by reducing scanning time or, crucially, by increasing image contrast. While these offer intuitive advantages, the relative merits of MP-RAGE and PSIR have not been systematically assessed to date. Brain tissue classification, the partition of a brain image into disjoint regions corresponding to three or more tissue types (typically, white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and â€œothersâ€ such as bone, skin, dura and the meninges) is the first step in many computational neuroscience studies and crucially depends on contrast. Consequently, it provides us with a realistic framework to compare performance. Aim: To quantitatively compare the performance of PSIR and MPRAGE by means of tissue classification. Method. Six healthy volunteers (5 males, 1 female, mean age: 32yrÂ±9yr) had their brain imaged on a Philips Achieva 7T scanner equipped with a NOVA 32 channel receive coil. First, three identical high-resolution 0.6mm isotropic MP-RAGE scans were acquired, to be later averaged together to improve SNR (TE/TR=6/15 ms, FA=8 ÌŠ, TI=1070ms, linear phase encoding, FOV of 200Ã—180Ã—140mm, Taq=12min20s). This was followed by a 0.6mm isotropic PSIR scan (SSi=5000ms, FA=8Â°, TE/TR=6/13ms, FOV= 200x180x140mm, Taq=11min55s) whereby 2 FFE images were simultaneously acquired at 2 different points during the inversion recovery: the first one at TI1=780ms, half-way between the null points of GM and WM, to produce null signal for the partial volume voxels at the GM/WM boundary and the second one at TI2=1600ms. The magnitude and phase information from the PSIR acquisition were then combined to produce a T1w image with double dynamic range. Finally, the TI2 image, which shows low image contrast but reflects the variation in signal due to B1 inhomogeneity, was smoothed to reduce the effect of noise and then used to remove the effect of B1 field inhomogeneities from the PSIR image by simple division. For comparison, four of the volunteers were also scanned on a Philips Achieva 3T scanner equipped with a 32 channel receive coil, using a standard 1mm isotropic MP-RAGE sequence (TE/TR=4/8ms, FA=8o, TI=960ms, linear phase encoding, FOV=256x256x160mm, Taq=4min). Each subjectâ€™s scans were first registered to their PSIR scan using SPM [2]. To improve SNR, the registered MP-RAGE scans were then averaged into a single MPRAGE image, onto which FSL bet2 was run [3] to obtain a brain mask. This mask was used to remove non-brain tissues in all scans, to facilitate tissue classification. All masked scans (MP-RAGE at 3T and 7T, and PSIR) were then conjointly non-uniformity corrected and tissue classified in SPM using the New Segment approach. Finally, the transformations obtained from the SPM classification step were used to backproject the 48 labels of the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas onto the scans in order to automatically define 48 cortical regions. We could then estimate, for each sequence, the volume of GM in each of the cortical regions defined by the atlas by integrating the tissue probability within those regions. We also computed the overall amount of WM on the probabilistic maps thresholded at 50%. Results. We ran a series of two-tailed paired t-tests to compare the regional GM volume estimates obtained from the PSIR and MP-RAGE scans at 7T across all atlas regions, using a 5% false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons. The superior frontal and precentral gyri were the only regions exhibiting significant differences, with strong trends in the middle and inferior parts of the frontal gyrus. Visual comparison between the sequences confirmed the loss of contrast exhibited by the 7T MP-RAGE scans in those regions, as a consequence of which the classification maps were incorrect. The 7T PSIR scans did not suffer from the issue and compared favorably with the 3T MP-RAGE scans (see Figure 1). We did not find any statistical difference in terms of overall WM volume. Discussion. Qualitative and quantitative inspection of the probabilistic tissue maps indicate that the enhanced contrast afforded by PSIR translates into an easier, more confident classification process, which produces better defined maps, as evidenced by a much reduced transition area with intermediate probabilities between gray and white (blue regions in Figure 1). While we did not record statistically different volumes across most cortical regions, or indeed in terms of total WM volume, the MP-RAGE maps were rather degraded at the periphery of the cortex, and statistically significantly so in the superior regions. This is consistent with the studies of Bock et al., who showed in marmosets [4] that the T1 of high myelin content regions was up to 15% shorter than in regions with a low myelin content at 7T, with a similar pattern in human at 3T [5]. Variations in T1 across the cortex, together with B1 inhomogeneities, make it difficult for an MP-RAGE sequence optimised for the whole head to perform well in the superior part of the frontal lobe, even after SPM's non-uniformity correction. PSIR's relative immunity from this issue probably stems from both its increased dynamic range and its inherent bias field correction. Overall, it not only delivers superb contrast throughout the entire brain but it does so much faster; three times faster in this study.",2012,,"list(name = ""Alain Pitiot"", ids = ""2291360""); list(name = ""Olivier E.

fcf3753ad98fe0f8012c577b5044c233b9a41ae9,Effects of pathogenic CNVs on biochemical markers: a study on the UK Biobank,"Background Pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) increase risk for medical disorders, even among carriers free from neurodevelopmental disorders. The UK Biobank recruited half a million adults who provided samples for biochemical and haematology tests which have recently been released. We wanted to assess how the presence of pathogenic CNVs affects these biochemical test results. Methods We called all CNVs from the Affymetrix microarrays and selected a set of 54 CNVs implicated as pathogenic (including their reciprocal deletions/duplications) and present in five or more persons. We used linear regression analysis to establish their association with 28 biochemical and 23 haematology tests. Results We analysed 421k participants who passed our CNV quality control filters and self-reported as white British or Irish descent. There were 268 associations between CNVs and biomarkers that were significant at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Deletions at 16p11.2 had the highest number of significant associations, but several rare CNVs had higher effect sizes indicating that the lack of significance was likely due to the reduced statistical power for rarer events. The distribution of values can be visualised on our interactive website: http://kirov.psycm.cf.ac.uk/. Conclusions Carriers of many pathogenic CNVs have changes in biochemical and haematology tests, and many of those are associated with adverse health consequences. These changes did not always correlate with increases in diagnosed medical disorders in this population. Carriers should have regular blood tests in order to identify and treat adverse medical consequences early. Levels of cholesterol and related lipids were unexpectedly lower in carriers of CNVs associated with increased weight gain, most likely due to the use of statins by such people.",2019,Biology,"list(name = ""Mathew Bracher-Smith"", ids = ""1401027681""); list(name = ""Kimberley M Kendall"", ids = ""46784317""); list(name = ""Elliott Rees"", ids = ""40595372""); list(name = ""Mark Einon"", ids = ""7575000""); list(name = ""Michael C.

We first compared global methylation profiles of 8 bone marrow samples with peripheral leucocytes by using a recently described novel method, the HELP assay (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR; Khulan et al, Genome Res. 2006 Aug;16(8)) that uses differential methylation-specific digestion by HpaII and MspI followed by amplification, two color labeling and hybridization to quantitatively determine individual promoter CpG island methylation. A whole genome human promoter array (Nimblegen) was used to determine the level of methylation of 25626 gene promoters by calculating HpaII/MspI cut fragment intensity ratio. We observed a high correlation (r=0.89â€“0.96) of epigenetic marks between bone marrow and peripheral blood samples suggesting that a majority of epigenetic marks can be also be seen in differentiated cells. We subsequently compared peripheral blood leucocytes from 20 patients with MDS with 10 age-matched normal and anemic controls. Parallel gene expression analysis was performed using 37K oligo maskless arrays on cDNA from the same samples. Analysis showed that whole genome methylation profiling has greater discriminatory power in separating clusters of MDS samples from normal and anemic controls when compared to gene expression analysis. Epigenetic profiling demonstrated two clusters of MDS based on similarity of aberrant epigenetic changes. Overall, there was a trend towards hypermethylation in MDS, albeit not statistically significant given the large number of relatively unchanged genes. Detailed analysis revealed several novel differentially methylated genes that had corresponding changes in gene expression, when MDS samples were compared to the controls with a low false discovery rate of analysis. Interesting genes getting hypomethylated and overexpressed included TNF superfamily member 9, granulocyte pep A, microsomal glutathione S-transferase, homeo box B4, mitochondrial RPL11, and others. Similarly, the set of genes that were getting hypermethylated with associated decrease in gene expression included Evi-1, DAPK, HOXB3, Protein Phosphatase 1, CEBPB, mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC), myeloid-lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5), plasminogen-related protein B, ovarian cancer related protein 1 (ORP1), and others. In addition, we did array-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) to look at exact genome copy number changes in these samples. We found changes that were not detectable by conventional karyotyping in all samples. Commonly seen alterations were del(14q11), del(20q11), del(5q13), del(8p23), amp(1q42), amp(5q11), amp(17q12), amp(19q13) and amp(7q22). Integrative analysis revealed sets of genes that were either silenced by methylation or deletion in different patients. Thus, our data demonstrates that promoter DNA methylation changes are an important phenomenon in MDS evolution, and are associated with changes in expression of genes playing important roles in cancer development and/or progression. We also show that previously unrecognizable changes in copy number exist in most patients with MDS. In addition, our work shows that whole genome methylation assays, even when done on peripheral blood leukocytes, can be used for potential biomarker studies in the diagnosis of MDS.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Li Zhou"", ids = ""48207123""); list(name = ""Joanna B.

92d180b07cafc78db024b24371b14aa4269cec23,Metabolic profiling of gestational diabetes in obese women during pregnancy,"Aims/hypothesisAntenatal obesity and associated gestational diabetes (GDM) are increasing worldwide. While pre-existing insulin resistance is implicated in GDM in obese women, the responsible metabolic pathways remain poorly described. Our aim was to compare metabolic profiles in blood of obese pregnant women with and without GDM 10Â weeks prior to and at the time of diagnosis by OGTT.MethodsWe investigated 646 women, of whom 198 developed GDM, in this prospective cohort study, a secondary analysis of UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT), a multicentre randomised controlled trial of a complex lifestyle intervention in obese pregnant women. Multivariate regression analyses adjusted for multiple testing, and accounting for appropriate confounders including study intervention, were performed to compare obese women with GDM with obese non-GDM women. We measured 163 analytes in serum, plasma or whole blood, including 147 from a targeted NMR metabolome, at time point 1 (mean gestational age 17Â weeks 0Â days) and time point 2 (mean gestational age 27Â weeks 5Â days, at time of OGTT) and compared them between groups.ResultsMultiple significant differences were observed in women who developed GDM compared with women without GDM (false discovery rate corrected p values <0.05). Most were evident prior to diagnosis. Women with GDM demonstrated raised lipids and lipoprotein constituents in VLDL subclasses, greater triacylglycerol enrichment across lipoprotein particles, higher branched-chain and aromatic amino acids and different fatty acid, ketone body, adipokine, liver and inflammatory marker profiles compared with those without GDM.Conclusions/interpretationAmong obese pregnant women, differences in metabolic profile, including exaggerated dyslipidaemia, are evident at least 10Â weeks prior to a diagnosis of GDM in the late second trimester.",2017,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""Sara L White"", ids = ""48008689""); list(name = ""Dharmintra Pasupathy"", ids = ""4682896""); list(name = ""Naveed Sattar"", ids = ""3952489""); list(name = ""Scott M Nelson"", ids = ""145025188""); list(name = ""Deborah A.

58860069b2cb66f34e283d7ded9102c2aec7bd19,Best (but oft-forgotten) practices: the multiple problems of multiplicity-whether and how to correct for many statistical tests.,"Testing many null hypotheses in a single study results in an increased probability of detecting a significant finding just by chance (the problem of multiplicity). Debates have raged over many years with regard to whether to correct for multiplicity and, if so, how it should be done. This article first discusses how multiple tests lead to an inflation of the Î± level, then explores the following different contexts in which multiplicity arises: testing for baseline differences in various types of studies, having >1 outcome variable, conducting statistical tests that produce >1 P value, taking multiple ""peeks"" at the data, and unplanned, post hoc analyses (i.e., ""data dredging,"" ""fishing expeditions,"" or ""P-hacking""). It then discusses some of the methods that have been proposed for correcting for multiplicity, including single-step procedures (e.g., Bonferroni); multistep procedures, such as those of Holm, Hochberg, and Å idÃ¡k; false discovery rate control; and resampling approaches. Note that these various approaches describe different aspects and are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, resampling methods could be used to control the false discovery rate or the family-wise error rate (as defined later in this article). However, the use of one of these approaches presupposes that we should correct for multiplicity, which is not universally accepted, and the article presents the arguments for and against such ""correction."" The final section brings together these threads and presents suggestions with regard to when it makes sense to apply the corrections and how to do so.",2015,Medicine,"list(name = ""David L Streiner"", ids = ""5426420"")",48a39c7bce9525ae615b738d3bfad73373986d4d;

938ab4bb6dfde8bceb78971f2dd81ca8a80291f6,DNA methylation and genetic polymorphisms of the Leptin gene interact to influence lung function outcomes and asthma at 18 years of age.,"The leptin gene (LEP) plays a regulatory role in satiety, inflammation, and allergy. Prior findings linking leptin to asthma motivated us to investigate whether DNA methylation (DNA-M) of CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites in concert with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LEP can explain the risk of asthma and lung function. Methylation of CpG sites was assessed using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 beadchip in blood samples collected from 10- and 18-year-old boys and girls from the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth cohort (UK). Four LEP SNPs were genotyped. Linear and log linear models were used for the analysis, adjusting for false discovery rate (FDR). The analyses were repeated in the BAMSE cohort (Sweden). In the IOW study, the interaction of cg00666422 and rs11763517 (CT vs TT and CC) was associated with FEV1 (FDR-adjusted p-value: 0.03), FEV1/FVC ratio (FDR-adjusted p-value: 0.0096), and FEF25-75% (FDR-adjusted p-value: 0.00048) such that they decreased with increasing DNA-M. The interaction of the same CpG-SNP pair was also associated with increased risk of asthma at age 18. We replicated the findings for FEV1/FVC and FEF25-75% in a smaller sample of 34 participants at age 10. Regarding the BAMSE cohort, although, the interaction of cg00666422 and rs11763517 on lung function were not significant, the direction of the effect was the same as in IOW cohort. Thus, penetrance of LEP genotype seems to be modified by methylation at cg00666422 and is linked to airway obstruction and asthma.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Nandini Mukherjee"", ids = ""145199334""); list(name = ""Gabrielle A Lockett"", ids = ""6682638""); list(name = ""Simon Kebede Merid"", ids = ""2117432""); list(name = ""Erik MelÃ©n"", ids = ""3749116""); list(name = ""GÃ¶ran Pershagen"", ids = ""3594026""); list(name = ""John W.

0b31e9a379941edd76c049ec8f3e52a64cefabd0,Meta-analyses of IL1A polymorphisms and the risk of several autoimmune diseases published in databases,"BACKGROUND
Based on published data, we aimed to quantitatively elucidate the possible genetic influence of rs17561 G/T and rs1800587 C/T polymorphisms of the IL1A (interleukin 1 alpha) gene in the susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases.


METHODS
A series of meta-analyses were carried out. After database searching, we utilized our inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen and include the eligible studies. Passociation (P value of association test), Bonferroni-corrected Passociation value; false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected Passociation, ORs (odd ratios), and 95% CI (confidence interval) were generated to assess the magnitudes of genetic relationships.


RESULTS
A total of 35 eligible articles were included. Pooled analysis data of both rs17561 G/T and rs1800587 C/T in the overall population indicated a negative association between cases of autoimmune diseases and negative controls (all Passociation>0.05, Bonferroni-corrected Passociation>0.05, FDR-corrected Passociation>0.05). Similar results were found in most subgroup analyses (all Passociation>0.05, Bonferroni-corrected Passociation>0.05, FDR-corrected Passociation>0.05), apart from the rs1800587 in the Graves' disease subgroup, which showed an increased risk in some cases, compared with controls, under the models of allele T vs. C, carrier T vs. C, CT+TT vs. CC, and CT vs. CC (all Passociation<0.05, Bonferroni-corrected Passociation<0.05, FDR-corrected Passociation>0.05, OR>1).


CONCLUSION
Based on the available data, C/T genotype of the rs1800587 polymorphism within IL1A gene may be associated with an increased Graves' disease risk. We did not see evidence regarding a positive role for rs1800587 or rs17561 in the risk of other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. These conclusions still merit further data support and molecular exploration.",2018,Medicine,"list(name = ""Hang Su"", ids = ""49466306""); list(name = ""Na Rei"", ids = ""46252369""); list(name = ""Lei Zhang"", ids = ""40174753""); list(name = ""Jiaxiang Cheng"", ids = ""48265468"")",42265f2305e7db63ddcb652fae1b85483aa95ddc; 8fc613224c079642a5fa40ea87831134cde71071; 2efb6aa5c44b2bef084b699f8c7f45c5437079f7,1c15a4d5d4a453bb7b1cd46640669bf77294f287; e9b307a887ba54583989b5a8010fc9e7fecc8027; 5755f623060ecd698fd0b7d1f55b1ed4823a04b7; 127959f2353451a52566b7bcff8ab81f41870d0c; d6ebb9ace393a6e045bcf15a1013f0f807aa6119; dcb6aeca47a1e2c5d93d8481d38e3d14968f19fb; 2c8e0df2383cfef94f783ca8672de91b156d2fad; f3932b15887cdc97a7a91de8ed8187c6a9bfe050; 1f344f328bd1921852882ab01cd786c09534f63e; e1ea263d05782a1e1774a99426ce43f848f97fa0; 315ac0eb44c613f10fc90291a857280550c49734; 2de79becb8cbf917a509472bcf423d3a8d628a6d; 73481d3d3184940dcbe56381708ca4aebb96d1a9; 5f396d96a824670eb10a856b3f947273c1e42c7e; 49b7ebfb26595ce52667fa42f25a09dd161ae4ef; b1e41830b604e1703eb7deb9d54f11101250ae95; 9a72b7adf05021273553e3550e371fada0ec984f; 47763f4665fdae10599503564ddd686871a70120; a0c7fc973c0d4031a53d2f07f006422b322eebbe; eb1901698797031a8aa1351545ae2d88df94f03a; 5bcba9eb5b5d335c74a2466a6df32707d6b4cbc1; 46bd9e57f09d89e930f5d86105f9313182064653; e459a252789f397d7bb67a83276024f0254c682a; 92724f348c3ea017241a68618362c483cb3e249c; 15434538a080cdf3db358d6d865311b21a5cc7d1; 204af613e533dbfcfd2829dbb1cda17e552251d5; b87b3fdc848ae7b14656ee2349edb8ed054726da; 936b63ed153c9a098025c62be426e221433de813; 5791cd99dab96c7203e861e374492b1e388c46ef; b8202b47a661ffd0fef9910c52e7039d204a6c88; 0c09db18a1980b1931b8a0045a641c91d9df19b7; 4e284cbabc9c4704b20406f09ce205c72c218154; 1fbdda3da7cf320124a23b2c19792b599b8e72d7; c0126ee4c4ec3db4bce9a16bd2d30ddbfed01ea8; 62f2332b0423a834b0a3cfa2c23da514a0a8a1c3; f54542bc788ce670e51e1e7cf4f8b243c57616a9; 15ff97cd9993e05dfd3b7a89a52750c115190aa9; 57fecaa1d29034cd90bf585a78ef950ed40535d6; 09af208838a49cd0518e0ae5893736c0b95ff996; a8ef60f79d8b00ed49e7c96e34d3f0789f6b9e74; 5eaa7530dd07d009bf64cf629c3c0e0cc2802947; 8f3eb43efed8f594ca817dc20d1d5d7f183f4a2e; 6cd3c74014ac66aed07923847a68d2042ecafeed; a13832f8876504bfb69b1ffda3a18f26247a4327; 5673b5d16e2b50f27f0c991587ec4c9de3dbdf15; 706d031ada1ca23d142dec09c0574c046f6312a8,PLoS ONE,13,
f2153327cbcddbc5c9e6e02b7ece1fbe2e912448,Transcriptional profiling using a novel cDNA array identifies differential gene expression during porcine embryo elongation.,"A novel porcine cDNA array, containing 1,015 PCR products selected for embryonic expression, was used for transcriptional profiling of conceptuses at four stages of peri-implantation development. Total conceptus RNA from small spherical, large spherical, tubular, and filamentous stages was amplified, converted to cDNA, and hybridized to membranes. Initially, normalized signal intensities obtained using cDNA from total RNA or from amplified RNA were compared. Uniform distribution of P-values associated with t-tests conducted for each gene indicated no evidence that amplification introduced bias. Analysis of data obtained by using amplified targets and the novel array identified genes differentially expressed across stages. Such genes were identified by testing for significant stage effects in gene-specific mixed models. A total of nine genes were declared differentially expressed. Six of the nine genes had P-values less than 0.001, and a false discovery rate of approximately 17% was associated with this significance threshold. Two out of six genes were significant when using the Bonferroni method to control the probability of one or more false positives. The other three genes had P-values between 0.001 and 0.01 and exhibited differences greater than twofold between stages. All four genes selected for confirmation (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, interleukin 1 beta, transforming growth factor beta 3, and thymosin beta 10) were shown to be differentially expressed by using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Our study shows that RNA amplification is useful for transcriptional profiling with limiting porcine embryonic RNA, and that this novel targeted array can detect differential gene expression during trophoblastic elongation. Finally, our results contribute to an increased understanding of the temporal patterns of expression of known genes controlling conceptus development, as well as identify novel genes also differentially regulated during implantation.",2005,Medicine; Biology,"list(name = ""So Hyun Lee"", ids = ""121945280""); list(name = ""Shu-Hong Zhao"", ids = ""152836890""); list(name = ""Justin Recknor"", ids = ""2941245""); list(name = ""Dan Nettleton"", ids = ""48443856""); list(name = ""Sarah Orley"", ids = ""32057445""); list(name = ""Sung-Keun Kang"", ids = ""3007636""); list(name = ""Byeong-chun Lee"", ids = ""79043780""); list(name = ""Woo-Suk Hwang"", ids = ""47401375""); list(name = ""Christopher K.

1b3d75575ba7336d248a2269709f9175d06bd025,Mapping abnormal subcortical neurodevelopment in a cohort of Thai children with HIV,"Alterations in subcortical brain structures have been reported in adults with HIV and, to a lesser extent, pediatric cohorts. The extent of longitudinal structural abnormalities in children with perinatal HIV infection (PaHIV) remains unclear. We modeled subcortical morphometry from whole brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (1.5â€¯T) scans of 43 Thai children with PaHIV (baseline ageâ€¯=â€¯11.09Â±2.36â€¯years) and 50 HIV- children (11.26Â±2.80â€¯years) using volumetric and surface-based shape analyses. The PaHIV sample were randomized to initiate combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) when CD4 counts were 15-24% (immediate: nâ€¯=â€¯22) or when CD4â€¯<â€¯15% (deferred: nâ€¯=â€¯21). Follow-up scans were acquired approximately 52â€¯weeks after baseline. Volumetric and shape descriptors capturing local thickness and surface area dilation were defined for the bilateral accumbens, amygdala, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, caudate, and hippocampus. Regression models adjusting for clinical and demographic variables examined between and within group differences in morphometry associated with HIV. We assessed whether baseline CD4 count and cART status or timing associated with brain maturation within the PaHIV group. All models were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. A pallidal subregion was significantly thinner in children with PaHIV. Regional thickness, surface area, and volume of the pallidum was associated with CD4 count in children with PaHIV. Longitudinal morphometry was not associated with HIV or cART status or timing, however, the trajectory of the left pallidum volume was positively associated with baseline CD4 count. Our findings corroborate reports in adult cohorts demonstrating a high predilection for HIV-mediated abnormalities in the basal ganglia, but suggest the effect of stable PaHIV infection on morphological aspects of brain development may be subtle.",2019,Medicine,"list(name = ""Benjamin S.

f0560cdfdcbe17e2a8e65bb6199b36634bce2fff,Intrinsic subtype-associated changes in the plasma proteome in breast cancer.,"Breast cancers are classified into five intrinsic subtypes: Luminal subtype A, Luminal subtype B, HER2+, Basal, and Normal-like. In this study, we compared the plasma proteome of patients with Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, and Basal subtype with plasma from healthy individuals. Protein changes were considered significant if q-value (false discovery rate) was less than 5%. The highest number of changes in the plasma proteome was observed in patients with Luminal type B followed by Basal type breast cancers. The plasma proteome of Luminal A and HER2+ breast cancer patients did not differ significantly from healthy individuals. In Basal breast cancer, a significant number of plasma proteins were downregulated compared with healthy individuals. Acute phase-response proteins Î±-glycoprotein orosomucoid 1 and serum amyloid protein P were specifically upregulated in the plasma of Luminal B breast cancer patients, suggesting prevalence of low-grade inflammation. Proteins involved in immune response and free radical scavenging were downregulated in the plasma of Luminal B patients, which is in agreement with defective immune system observed in cancer patients. These results reveal intrinsic subtype specific changes in the plasma proteome that may influence tumor progression as well as the systemic effects of cancer.",2009,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Harikrishna Nakshatri"", ids = ""1769143""); list(name = ""Guihong D.

35177b890c6083e76f6062893874f7f31c1a8382,Proteogenomic strategies for identification of aberrant cancer peptides using large-scale next-generation sequencing data.,"Cancer is driven by the acquisition of somatic DNA lesions. Distinguishing the early driver mutations from subsequent passenger mutations is key to molecular subtyping of cancers, understanding cancer progression, and the discovery of novel biomarkers. The advances of genomics technologies (whole-genome exome, and transcript sequencing, collectively referred to as NGS (next-generation sequencing)) have fueled recent studies on somatic mutation discovery. However, the vision is challenged by the complexity, redundancy, and errors in genomic data, and the difficulty of investigating the proteome translated portion of aberrant genes using only genomic approaches. Combination of proteomic and genomic technologies are increasingly being employed. Various strategies have been employed to allow the usage of large-scale NGS data for conventional MS/MS searches. This paper provides a discussion of applying different strategies relating to large database search, and FDR (false discovery rate) -based error control, and their implication to cancer proteogenomics. Moreover, it extends and develops the idea of a unified genomic variant database that can be searched by any MS sample. A total of 879 BAM files downloaded from TCGA repository were used to create a 4.34 GB unified FASTA database that contained 2787062 novel splice junctions, 38,464 deletions, 1,105 insertions, and 182,302 substitutions. Proteomic data from a single ovarian carcinoma sample (439,858 spectra) was searched against the database. By applying the most conservative FDR measure, we have identified 524 novel peptides and 65,578 known peptides at 1% FDR threshold. The novel peptides include interesting examples of doubly mutated peptides, frame-shifts, and nonsample-recruited mutations, which emphasize the strength of our approach.",2014,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Sunghee Woo"", ids = ""49828630""); list(name = ""Seong Won Cha"", ids = ""7939371""); list(name = ""Seungjin Na"", ids = ""2431286""); list(name = ""Clark C.

c2c44fe3a21444e788827ff0616ccd3e5a45b507,"Molecular Effects of Rituximab on CLL Cells In Vivo: Rapid Increase in Serum Interferon gamma, Induction of a Distinct Tumor Cell Gene Expression Signature and Loss of CD20 Expression.","Proposed mechanisms on how the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (R) depletes B-cells include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In vitro studies have suggested that R induced pro-apoptotic signals contribute to clinical efficacy and may sensitize cells to chemotherapy. To investigate the effect of R on tumor biology in vivo , we analyzed the molecular changes in leukemic cells of 12 previously untreated CLL patients during the first R (375mg/m2) infusion. The median reduction of circulating tumor cells within 24h was 50% (range 0â€“67%). We first determined whether R affects gene expression in CLL cells obtained before and at 6h and 24h after the start of R. Cells were purified by CD19+ selection and gene expression was measured on Affymetrix HU133A 2.0 arrays. A one-way ANOVA test with a stringent cutoff (false discovery rate of 50% at 6h compared to pre treatment, and 31 genes whose expression decreased by >30%. Most of the up-regulated genes are known to be regulated by interferon (IFN) and include the pro-apoptotic genes IRF1, STAT1, FAS and OAS2. Of 12 cytokines assayed in the serum, we found that only IFNy, ILâ€“6, ILâ€“8, ILâ€“10, and TNFa were induced by R with a peak at 2h. Consistent with a dominant role of IFNy on gene expression in the CLL cells, STAT1, a direct and essential mediator of IFNy signaling, was activated in circulating leukemic cells in vivo. In addition, when comparing the response between patients, IFNy serum protein levels correlated strongly with the intensity of the gene expression changes in the tumor cells (r=0.83, p=0.008). We could not detect any IFNy mRNA in CLL cells and conclude that the IFNy is most likely released by NK cells activated through FcyRIII signaling. Considering the long half-life of R, we were surprised to see that both cytokine serum levels and gene expression changes almost completely subsided by 24h. Intriguingly, among the few genes that were down-regulated by treatment, the gene encoding CD20 was the most strongly and consistently affected showing a 50% decrease in expression at 24h. We also assessed CD20 protein levels by Western blotting. Total CD20 levels were markedly decreased already at 6h and by 24h almost all CD20 had been lost. The more rapid and more pronounced decrease of CD20 protein as opposed to mRNA levels is consistent with a process previously described as shaving, during which R bound CD20 is pulled of the cell surface (Kennedy AD, J Immunol. 2004). Despite the absence of a clinical cytokine release syndrome, we observed basically identical changes in serum cytokines and gene expression with subsequent infusions in 2 patients analyzed. In summary, R induced a characteristic gene expression signature in CLL cells that is dominated by IFN response genes, many of which have well characterized pro-apoptotic functions. Thus, our data suggest that signaling for apoptosis is not so much a direct effect of R, but due to a complex immune response to the R coated CLL cells. Modified treatment schedules capable of delivering sustained pro-apoptotic signals hold promise for improved efficacy of R and should be explored.",2007,Biology,"list(name = ""Adrian Wiestner"", ids = ""5801391""); list(name = ""Elinor Lee"", ids = ""10283130""); list(name = ""BÃ©rengÃ¨re Vire"", ids = ""46786334""); list(name = ""Federica Gibellini"", ids = ""3703884""); list(name = ""Ndegwa Njuguna"", ids = ""11183686""); list(name = ""Yair Herishanu"", ids = ""5220158""); list(name = ""Delong Liu"", ids = ""50439044""); list(name = ""Peter J.

bfecad1a99a814ebd90111349dc67a852d9e2861,Empirical Null Estimation using Discrete Mixture Distributions and its Application to Protein Domain Data,"In recent mutation studies, analyses based on protein domain positions are gaining popularity over gene-centric approaches since the latter have limitations in considering the functional context that the position of the mutation provides. This presents a large-scale simultaneous inference problem, with hundreds of hypothesis tests to consider at the same time. This paper aims to select significant mutation counts while controlling a given level of Type I error via False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedures. One main assumption is that there exists a cut-off value such that smaller counts than this value are generated from the null distribution. We present several data-dependent methods to determine the cut-off value. We also consider a two-stage procedure based on screening process so that the number of mutations exceeding a certain value should be considered as significant mutations. Simulated and protein domain data sets are used to illustrate this procedure in estimation of the empirical null using a mixture of discrete distributions.",2016,Mathematics,"list(name = ""Iris Ivy M.

f3b703a8599bb0a16703acc57ebf9a9f7aa04c15,Associations of genetic variants in endocytic trafficking of epidermal growth factor receptor super pathway with risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate,"BACKGROUND
The genetic etiology of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) has not been fully clarified to date. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was reportedly involved in its biological establishment and regulation of cell migration during the embryonic stage.


METHODS
We selected a super pathway of endocytic trafficking of EGFR and investigated the associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the super pathway with the risk of NSCL/P by analyzing our published genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 504 NSCL/P individuals and 455 controls. After the false discovery rate (FDR) control, we conducted linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses and conditional regression analyses to obtain independent lead SNPs. We performed LD analyses between the lead SNPs and the reported SNPs to find novel ones from our study. We annotated the lead SNPs and investigated their mapped genes in silico.


RESULTS
A total of 82 SNPs showed a statistical association with the risk of NSCL/P after FDR control. They contained three reported SNPs which were g.117068049G>A (rs7078160), g.117086783C>G (rs10886040), and g.117101266G>T (rs17095681). Four independent lead SNPs were obtained, including g.116979803Â T>C (rs1905539) and g.117037960A>G (rs7902502) at 10q25.3, g.35720163G>C (rs75656820) at 17q12, and g.156864512G>A (rs1800877) at 1q23.1. Three of them were in low LD (r2 Â <Â 0.5) with the reported SNPs except g.117037960A>G (rs7902502), so these three were newly identified. Lead SNPs were mapped to three genes: SHTN1, AP2B1, and NTRK1. The three genes were relatively more highly expressed in the human craniofacial region and in the proximal maxillary location during the craniofacial development stage of the embryonic mouse.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggested that SHTN1, AP2B1, and NTRK1 might be associated with the development of NSCL/P.",2018,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bing Li"", ids = ""48218586""); list(name = ""Lan Ma"", ids = ""50709696""); list(name = ""Chi Zhang"", ids = ""47423554""); list(name = ""Zhi-xuan Zhou"", ids = ""50251901""); list(name = ""Hua Yuan"", ids = ""144471061""); list(name = ""Hongbing Jiang"", ids = ""34371903""); list(name = ""Yongchu Pan"", ids = ""3891204""); list(name = ""Qian Tan"", ids = ""145843052"")",,b8c07f405e5091c395ac47589930bb30da8b4d77; 943a01149f0d074aefb3da5fa9ffe6d4c50de9e8; 3e8677741f8f172b7871e2ab9e08057ca9eaecef; 1d1ef9345fa64a566f4e044246eec46b13a128a5; 6bed83b8f2a8f7b77db75f4142831687d13ee3b1; 45202adbde890b1d1e5341524dce27d0a0fdfb37; f68c19bb480f8c41e52b330c93aa5c70ef0267c3; 2f648e5ac35d53104c2926d50310690cf72b845c; 4d2d45bb449b0f023e1b37bd9952c75a77ffdf09; 3da627a75f1ede6eac7af698a19ab5e8fb47aac2; b50c43659414413bc76d6bb14ad060dab38ac94c; f713d8fe741924d767843a5ec8659a1eee9d512c; 9895686cf332742cf7d8c82a69d132ab46e29cb3; 357d38524d56beda8043ce6c4b5850e3b7b9d27e; 0ed8cc9ed1ed9dff65d75df7425b68e58baf0544; 50f0bc82134d073982f6e8e6a4d877fbd380c0f7; 8d4926e91a30cc9afd8d2083bd27f796e498bee4; 20e00b8618ba7e521b51ebf2c2d41a0d10187b37; 5498feb293c98371d47bea089938ba547983b79a; be8da763ad43e4695a189478659f30f0c7db03e5; 546fd018fba4337307c90db5dc6f4662b351f893; 4d22fde72702b6c31e6ae2ea6a82ec608ef25f22; d529b8d1c69cfea96740beda8b9bf15f240f7d5a; a2e5cb4898ff903d425f096ecf9a82074a855c9b; b1c0f46c115cbca629a82090769b80549c7c248f; 47935fa838794f4ff0f26a00be1bd79d81418ce5; eb58fb6a9204161ddbbe82dc44f1451abb6c5440; ae056b7ee03c743f81f184f516b003d09d340acf; 994a68ecd22f99a115c32c74cf9d2e311eaf0906; 6b77e2749e0e3f1eef3cfc8f8e2a9354d8a94d5f; f603bd0a37967378fb54ff00df7cc1c81f9a453d; 572371ada5e8317fee13a687f3431547b711965d; d877c233ce1986578109d848e5161bad1ab16c63; f3b652ec76d208e1c2f801a6eab64a2a7837e300; 9262705fa16be98d2066e8470d9590057677ff83; a55bc18446e4209453c08a8d8ceb2f4a4a3a8977; b2fc193d6219830e5b80c4649725a7c71f21534f; 7e2a077c8f784704d624b39e18cfe36baae1c524; d868486f256994e1a6a7c94780af714f2974ecc7,Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine,6,1157 - 1167
c5ca3b347eafd7b6d8054967e6c6fcf5f852604c,Maternal plasma folate impacts differential DNA methylation in an epigenome-wide meta-analysis of newborns,"Folate is vital for fetal development. Periconceptional folic acid supplementation and food fortification are recommended to prevent neural tube defects. Mechanisms whereby periconceptional folate influences normal development and disease are poorly understood: epigenetics may be involved. We examine the association between maternal plasma folate during pregnancy and epigenome-wide DNA methylation using Illumina's HumanMethyl450 Beadchip in 1,988 newborns from two European cohorts. Here we report the combined covariate-adjusted results using meta-analysis and employ pathway and gene expression analyses. Four-hundred forty-three CpGs (320 genes) are significantly associated with maternal plasma folate levels during pregnancy (false discovery rate 5%); 48 are significant after Bonferroni correction. Most genes are not known for folate biology, including APC2, GRM8, SLC16A12, OPCML, PRPH, LHX1, KLK4 and PRSS21. Some relate to birth defects other than neural tube defects, neurological functions or varied aspects of embryonic development. These findings may inform how maternal folate impacts the developing epigenome and health outcomes in offspring.",2016,Biology; Medicine,"list(name = ""Bonnie R Joubert"", ids = ""4371799""); list(name = ""Herman T den Dekker"", ids = ""114343967""); list(name = ""Janine F.

7e482903e0e268c239db3150fde766d72ccea27f,Abstract PR-6: Variation in VDR pathway genes and renal cancer risk,"PR-6 The conversion of vitamin D to its main biologically active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, occurs in the kidney. Since the most biologically active form of vitamin D exerts its activity through binding to the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR), most studies of genetic susceptibility have primarily focused on variation within the VDR gene. But, the concert of genes that interact with VDR are vast; therefore, an analysis of genetic variation in VDR and other genes in its pathway may provide insight into the role of vitamin D in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) etiology. In this case-control study, we investigated the relationship between RCC risk and 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 target genes (VDR, RXRA, RXRB, CYP24A1, GC, STAT1, THRAP4 and TRAP5) of the expanded vitamin D pathway from subjects residing in Central and Eastern Europe. 1,097 RCC cases and 1,476 controls were recruited for this study where genomic DNA was analyzed using an Illumina Oligo Pool-All (OPA) assay. First, the minimum-p-value permutation (Min-P) test was used to identify genes that were associated with RCC risk and that remained significant at a cut off level of 10%. Next, a haplotype-based sliding window analysis of three consecutive SNPs was used to identify chromosome regions of interest that remained significant at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 10%. For these regions, haplotype relative risks were computed using the HaploStats package in R. Significant Min-P values were observed for two genes, which were selected for in-depth analysis: VDR (P-value: 0.024) and RXRA (P-value: 0.100). Two chromosomal regions of interest within the VDR gene were identified using the haplotype-based sliding window technique. The first region identified two haplotypes within intron 2, centered around rs4760648, that significantly increased RCC risk (haplotype 1: OR= 1.25; 95% CI= 1.04-1.50 and hapotype 2: OR= 1.26; 95% CI= 1.02-1.54) when compared to patients with the most common referent haplotype. The second signal identified a haplotype (rs886441 and rs12717991) located within intron 4 of the VDR gene that was associated with increased risk among participants with the TG (OR= 1.29; 95%CI= 1.08-1.54) haplotype compared to participants with most common referent haplotype, CA. The global p-values in R for these haplotypes were 0.025 and 0.028, respectively. Across the RXRA gene, a single haplotype located downstream, 3â€™ of the coding sequence, centered around rs3118523 was shown to increase RCC risk (OR= 1.41; 95% CI= 1.10-1.82) among individuals with the variant haplotype compared to those with the most common haplotype. This is the first study to our knowledge to comprehensively evaluate genetic variation in VDR and other pathway genes in relation to RCC risk. While replication and fine mapping studies will be required to confirm these findings, this study suggests that genes in the vitamin D pathway may modify RCC risk.

2e0040403ecc62f834adc5a4bf20a7b223d927a5,Proteogenomics of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in fruit fly,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is one of the most common types of RNA editing, a posttranscriptional modification made by special enzymes. We present a proteomic study on this phenomenon for Drosophila melanogaster. Tree deep proteome data sets for Canton-S fruit fly line were used in the study: two taken from public repository and the third one obtained here for the isolated brains. A customized protein sequence database was generated using results of genome-wide adenosine-to-inosine RNA studies in fruit fly and applied for identifying the edited proteins. The total number of 56 edited proteins was found in all data sets, 7 of them being shared between the whole insect, head and brain proteomes. Two edited sites in syntaxin 1A (Syx1a) and complexin (cpx) belonging to a presynaptic vesicle fusion complex were selected for validation by targeted analysis. The results obtained for two selected peptides using Multiple Reaction Monitoring have shown remarkably constant ratios of unedited-to-edited protein variants in flies raised under different ambient temperatures of 10, 20 and 30Â°C. Specifically, these ratios were 34.5:1 and 2.1:1 for Syx1a and cpx, respectively. The work demonstrates the feasibility to identify the RNA editing event at the proteome level using shotgun proteomics and customized edited protein database.

c2599267673212016b98a7819eed721fa24e4d2c,OP0257 Differential DNA Methylation Related to Response to Adalimumab and Etanercept in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Background Anti-TNF therapies have proved a huge advance for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), however very good disease control or remission is achieved in just 30% of patients. This makes the identification of biomarkers predictive of response an important area of research. Such predictive biomarkers would allow the most effective treatment for a patient to be identified early in disease course. An increasing number of studies have identified a role for epigenetics in RA and other autoimmune disorders, thus we hypothesised that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, may provide potential biomarkers of response to anti-TNFs. Objectives To identify methylation signatures predictive of response to anti-TNF therapies in patients with RA. Methods Patients were selected from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate (BRAGGSS) longitudinal cohort. Patients (n=119) were selected based on having an extreme response phenotype after 3 months of treatment with etanercept or adalimumab; 36 were good responders to etanercept and 30 to adalimumab defined as having an endpoint DAS28 5.1. DNA from each patient, sampled before initiation of therapy, was bisulfite converted and an epigenome-wide association study was conducted using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). The results from each drug were analysed separately using the minfi package in R and probes with a detection-p value >0.01 were removed. Differentially methylated positions between responders and non-responders were identified using the F-test following quantile normalisation. Results In the etanercept study, four CpG sites showed differential DNA methylation that passed a false discovery rate of 0.05, while in the adalimumab study, two CpG sites passed this threshold. The most differentially methylated position in etanercept patients mapped to the LRPAP1 gene (p=1.46Ã—10 -8 ). This gene encodes a chaperone of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) which is known to influence TGF-Î² activity. Technical validation of methylation at this site by pyrosequencing showed very good correlation (Spearmans r=0.8). In the adalimumab patients, the most differentially methylated position maps to the MAD2L2 gene. Conclusions This is one of the largest methylome-wide investigations of treatment response to anti-TNF therapies in RA. These preliminary results identify DNA methylation as a potential biomarker of response for etanercept and adalimumab.

8cd8abfb84f2f3c1be53b0928141405957906dfa,The Cation Transporter SLC22A16 Is Expressed in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Hydrophilic drugs require transport proteins to traverse the cell membrane, and the selective expression of these membrane transporters can confer selective sensitivity to their toxic substrates. Therefore, identification of a transport gene with restricted expression on tumor cells represents an opportunity to target that transporter with a selective, toxic substrate. We previously have demonstrated that the organic cation transport gene SLC22A16 (OCT6) is highly expressed in the leukemia cell line HL-60, and its RNA levels were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher in 25 unique specimens of adult leukemic blasts than in liver, placenta and kidney, the tissues that usually have high expression of SLC22 transporters (Gong, S. et al. Experimental Hematology, 30, 1â€“8, 2002). To determine the relevance of SLC22A16 gene expression in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined its expression using an Affymetrix U133B gene expression microarray in 132 primary pediatric ALL specimens. SLC22A16 was broadly and highly expressed in these pediatric ALL primary specimens. The gene was represented by 2 probesets, with average expression levels of 922 Â± 344 in one probeset and 1715 Â± 857 in the other. Analysis of subgroups revealed that overall expression was highest in hyperdiploid (>50) ALL specimens (n=17), and lowest in T cell ALL (n=14). The gene with highest correlation with SLC22A16 on the U133B array was ERG (Pearson p=2.4 Ã— 10 âˆ’8 ; False Discovery Rate (FDR) =5.2 Ã— 10 âˆ’5 ), a member of the Ets family of transcription factors that are implicated in leukemogenesis. MLL gene expression correlated with SLC22A16 expression with a Pearson p=3.3 Ã— 10 âˆ’5 and FDR=0.005. Other genes of special interest in leukemia biology with significant expression correlation to SLC22A16 included LIMD1, a member of the ZYXIN family (Pearson p=2.3 Ã— 10 âˆ’6 , FDR=0.001), PPAR-alpha (Pearson p=4.5 Ã— 10 âˆ’7 , FDR=0.0004), and STS-1 (Pearson p=7 Ã— 10 âˆ’7 , FDR=0.0005). To examine protein expression of SLC22A16 in pediatric ALL, a polyclonal antibody to SLC22A16, that recognizes a protein of expected size in HL-60 cells, demonstrated expression of this protein at a level comparable to HL-60 cells in 3 of 6 primary pediatric B-precursor ALL specimens. These results suggest that an SLC22A16 substrate plays a physiologic role in pediatric ALL, and that SLC22A16 is a new therapeutic target for pediatric ALL that could be exploited by SLC22A16-specific toxins and antibodies.",2008,Biology,"list(name = ""Jeffrey A.
